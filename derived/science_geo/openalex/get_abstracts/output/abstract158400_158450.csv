https://openalex.org/W2089637736,"A simple method was used to assemble single-walled carbon nanotubes into indefinitely long ribbons and fibers. The processing consists of dispersing the nanotubes in surfactant solutions, recondensing the nanotubes in the flow of a polymer solution to form a nanotube mesh, and then collating this mesh to a nanotube fiber. Flow-induced alignment may lead to a preferential orientation of the nanotubes in the mesh that has the form of a ribbon. Unlike classical carbon fibers, the nanotube fibers can be strongly bent without breaking. Their obtained elastic modulus is 10 times higher than the modulus of high-quality bucky paper."
https://openalex.org/W2071507111,"The matrix metalloproteinase MMP-9/gelatinase B is upregulated in angiogenic dysplasias and invasive cancers of the epidermis in a mouse model of multi-stage tumorigenesis elicited by HPV16 oncogenes. Transgenic mice lacking MMP-9 show reduced keratinocyte hyperproliferation at all neoplastic stages and a decreased incidence of invasive tumors. Yet those carcinomas that do arise in the absence of MMP-9 exhibit a greater loss of keratinocyte differentiation, indicative of a more aggressive and higher grade tumor. Notably, MMP-9 is predominantly expressed in neutrophils, macrophages, and mast cells, rather than in oncogene-positive neoplastic cells. Chimeric mice expressing MMP-9 only in cells of hematopoietic origin, produced by bone marrow transplantation, reconstitute the MMP-9-dependent contributions to squamous carcinogenesis. Thus, inflammatory cells can be coconspirators in carcinogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2150070295,"The detection of osmotic stimuli is essential for all organisms, yet few osmoreceptive proteins are known, none of them in vertebrates. By employing a candidate-gene approach based on genes encoding members of the TRP superfamily of ion channels, we cloned cDNAs encoding the vanilloid receptor-related osmotically activated channel (VR-OAC) from the rat, mouse, human, and chicken. This novel cation-selective channel is gated by exposure to hypotonicity within the physiological range. In the central nervous system, the channel is expressed in neurons of the circumventricular organs, neurosensory cells responsive to systemic osmotic pressure. The channel also occurs in other neurosensory cells, including inner-ear hair cells, sensory neurons, and Merkel cells."
https://openalex.org/W1487695731,"PSD-95 is a neuronal PDZ protein that associates with receptors and cytoskeletal elements at synapses, but whose function is uncertain. We found that overexpression of PSD-95 in hippocampal neurons can drive maturation of glutamatergic synapses. PSD-95 expression enhanced postsynaptic clustering and activity of glutamate receptors. Postsynaptic expression of PSD-95 also enhanced maturation of the presynaptic terminal. These effects required synaptic clustering of PSD-95 but did not rely on its guanylate kinase domain. PSD-95 expression also increased the number and size of dendritic spines. These results demonstrate that PSD-95 can orchestrate synaptic development and are suggestive of roles for PSD-95 in synapse stabilization and plasticity."
https://openalex.org/W2106471390,"We have applied an inverse model to 20 years of atmospheric carbon dioxide measurements to infer yearly changes in the regional carbon balance of oceans and continents. The model indicates that global terrestrial carbon fluxes were approximately twice as variable as ocean fluxes between 1980 and 1998. Tropical land ecosystems contributed most of the interannual changes in Earth's carbon balance over the 1980s, whereas northern mid- and high-latitude land ecosystems dominated from 1990 to 1995. Strongly enhanced uptake of carbon was found over North America during the 1992-1993 period compared to 1989-1990."
https://openalex.org/W2112998064,"P-, E- and L-selectin constitute a family of cell adhesion receptors that mediate the initial tethering and rolling of leukocytes on inflamed endothelium as a prelude to their firm attachment and extravasation into tissues. The selectins bind weakly to sialyl LewisX (SLeX)-like glycans, but with high-affinity to specific glycoprotein counterreceptors, including PSGL-1. Here, we report crystal structures of human P- and E-selectin constructs containing the lectin and EGF (LE) domains co-complexed with SLeX. We also present the crystal structure of P-selectin LE co-complexed with the N-terminal domain of human PSGL-1 modified by both tyrosine sulfation and SLeX. These structures reveal differences in how E- and P-selectin bind SLeX and the molecular basis of the high-affinity interaction between P-selectin and PSGL-1."
https://openalex.org/W1964562548,"The Listeria monocytogenes surface protein InlB promotes bacterial entry into mammalian cells. Here, we identify a cellular surface receptor required for InlB-mediated entry. Treatment of mammalian cells with InlB protein or infection with L. monocytogenes induces rapid tyrosine phosphorylation of Met, a receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) for which the only known ligand is Hepatocyte Growth Factor (HGF). Like HGF, InlB binds to the extracellular domain of Met and induces ""scattering"" of epithelial cells. Experiments with Met-positive and Met-deficient cell lines demonstrate that Met is required for InlB-dependent entry of L. monocytogenes. InlB is a novel Met agonist that induces bacterial entry through exploitation of a host RTK pathway."
https://openalex.org/W1517927116,"TNAs [( l )-α-threofuranosyl oligonucleotides] containing vicinally connected (3′→2′) phosphodiester bridges undergo informational base pairing in antiparallel strand orientation and are capable of cross-pairing with RNA and DNA. Being derived from a sugar containing only four carbons, TNA is structurally the simplest of all potentially natural oligonucleotide-type nucleic acid alternatives studied thus far. This, along with the base-pairing properties of TNA, warrants close scrutiny of the system in the context of the problem of RNA's origin."
https://openalex.org/W2088801927,"T cell memory depends on factors that regulate expansion and death of these cells after antigenic stimulation. Mice deficient in perforin and interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) exhibited increased expansion, altered immunodominance, and decreased death of antigen-specific CD8+ T cells after infection with an attenuated strain of Listeria monocytogenes, which was cleared from these mice. Expansion of CD8+ T cells was controlled by perforin, whereas IFN-gamma regulated immunodominance and the death phase. Thus, perforin and IFN-gamma regulate distinct elements of CD8+ T cell homeostasis independently of their role as antimicrobial effector molecules."
https://openalex.org/W2023548208,"The serine proteinase granzyme B is crucial for the rapid induction of target cell apoptosis by cytotoxic T cells. Granzyme B was recently demonstrated to enter cells in a perforin-independent manner, thus predicting the existence of a cell surface receptor(s). We now present evidence that this receptor is the cation-independent mannose 6-phosphate/insulin-like growth factor receptor (CI-MPR). Inhibition of the granzyme B-CI-MPR interaction prevented granzyme B cell surface binding, uptake, and the induction of apoptosis. Significantly, expression of the CI-MPR was essential for cytotoxic T cell-mediated apoptosis of target cells in vitro and for the rejection of allogeneic cells in vivo. These results suggest a novel target for immunotherapy and a potential mechanism used by tumors for immune evasion."
https://openalex.org/W2000915153,"Population biologists have long been interested in the oscillations in population size displayed by many organisms in the field and laboratory. A wide range of deterministic mathematical models predict that these fluctuations can be generated internally by nonlinear interactions among species and, if correct, would provide important insights for understanding and predicting the dynamics of interacting populations. We studied the dynamical behavior of a two-species aquatic laboratory community encompassing the interactions between a demographically structured herbivore population, a primary producer, and a mineral resource, yet still amenable to description and parameterization using a mathematical model. The qualitative dynamical behavior of our experimental system, that is, cycles, equilibria, and extinction, is highly predictable by a simple nonlinear model."
https://openalex.org/W2038533031,"Despite the fact that Leishmania are transmitted exclusively by sand flies, none of the experimental models of leishmaniasis have established infection via sand fly bites. Here we describe a reproducible murine model of Leishmania major infection transmitted by Phlebotomus papatasi . Prior exposure of mice to bites of uninfected sand flies conferred powerful protection against Leishmania major that was associated with a strong delayed-type hypersensitivity response and with interferon-γ production at the site of parasite delivery. These results have important implications for the epidemiology of cutaneous leishmaniasis and suggest a vaccination strategy against this and possibly other vector-borne diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2140748458,"The box C/D snoRNAs function in directing 2′-O-methylation and/or as chaperones in the processing of ribosomal RNA. We show here that Snu13p (15.5kD in human), a component of the U4/U6.U5 tri-snRNP, is also associated with the box C/D snoRNAs. Indeed, genetic depletion of Snu13p in yeast leads to a major defect in RNA metabolism. The box C/D motif can be folded into a stem-internal loop-stem structure, almost identical to the 15.5kD binding site in the U4 snRNA. Consistent with this, the box C/D motif binds Snu13p/15.5kD in vitro. The similarities in structure and function observed between the U4 snRNP (chaperone for U6) and the box C/D snoRNPs raises the interesting possibility that these particles may have evolved from a common ancestral RNP."
https://openalex.org/W2044681616,"Nucleosomes impose a block to transcription that can be overcome in vivo by remodeling complexes such as SNF/SWI and histone modification complexes such as SAGA. Mutations in the major core histones relieve transcriptional repression and bypass the requirement for SNF/SWI and SAGA. We have found that the variant histone H2A.Z regulates gene transcription, and deletion of the gene encoding H2A.Z strongly increases the requirement for SNF/SWI and SAGA. This synthetic genetic interaction is seen at the level of single genes and acts downstream of promoter nucleosome reorganization. H2A.Z is preferentially crosslinked in vivo to intergenic DNA at the PH05 and GAL1 loci, and this association changes with transcriptional activation. These results describe a novel pathway for regulating transcription using variant histones to modulate chromatin structure."
https://openalex.org/W2104301808,"The ISWI class of chromatin remodeling factors exhibits potent chromatin remodeling activities in vitro. However, the in vivo functions of this class of factors are unknown at a molecular level. We have found that S. cerevisiae Isw2 complex represses transcription of early meiotic genes during mitotic growth in a parallel pathway to Rpd3-Sin3 histone deacetylase complex. This repressor function of lsw2 complex is largely dependent upon Ume6p, which recruits the complex to target genes. Nuclease digestion analyses revealed that lsw2 complex establishes nuclease-inaccessible chromatin structure near the Ume6p binding site in vivo. Based on these findings, we propose a model for the mechanism of transcriptional repression by two distinct chromatin remodeling complexes."
https://openalex.org/W1984121486,"The segregation of lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) axons into ocular dominance columns is believed to involve a prolonged, activity-dependent sorting process. However, visualization of early postnatal ferret LGN axons by direct LGN tracer injections revealed segregated ocular dominance columns <7 days after innervation of layer 4. These early columns were unaffected by experimentally induced imbalances in retinal activity, implying that different mechanisms govern initial column formation and their modification during the subsequent critical period. Instead of activity-dependent plasticity, we propose that ocular dominance column formation relies on the targeting of distinct axonal populations to defined locales in cortical layer 4."
https://openalex.org/W2129251738,"A principal aim of current conservation policy is to reduce the impact of habitat fragmentation. Conservation corridors may achieve this goal by facilitating movement among isolated patches, but there is a risk that increased connectivity could synchronize local population fluctuations (causing coherent oscillations) and thereby increase the danger of global extinction. We identify general conditions under which populations can or cannot undergo coherent oscillations, and we relate these conditions to local and global extinction probabilities. We suggest a simple method to explore the potential success of conservation corridors and, more generally, any manipulations of dispersal patterns that aim to protect threatened species or control pests."
https://openalex.org/W1990137723,"A defect-induced, critical phase separation in dipolar fluids is predicted, which replaces the usual liquid-gas transition that is driven by the isotropic aggregation of particles and is absent in dipolar fluids due to strong chaining. The coexisting phases are a dilute gas of chain ends that coexists with a high-density liquid of chain branching points. Our model provides a unified explanation for the branched structures, the unusually low critical temperature and density, and the consequent two-phase coexistence ""islands"" that were recently observed in experiment and simulation."
https://openalex.org/W1990118065,"In Xenopus development, the expression of several maternal mRNAs is regulated by cytoplasmic polyadenylation. CPEB and maskin, two factors that control polyadenylation-induced translation are present on the mitotic apparatus of animal pole blastomeres in embryos. Cyclin B1 protein and mRNA, whose translation is regulated by polyadenylation, are colocalized with CPEB and maskin. CPEB interacts with microtubules and is involved in the localization of cyclin B1 mRNA to the mitotic apparatus. Agents that disrupt polyadenylation-induced translation inhibit cell division and promote spindle and centrosome defects in injected embryos. Two of these agents inhibit the synthesis of cyclin B1 protein and one, which has little effect on this process, disrupts the localization of cyclin B1 mRNA and protein. These data suggest that CPEB-regulated mRNA translation is important for the integrity of the mitotic apparatus and for cell division."
https://openalex.org/W2075113278,"Growing evidence from patients with heart failure and from experimental animal models implicates effectors of innate immunity in the pathogenesis of this syndrome. The expression of the innate immunity signaling protein, Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), is increased in cardiac myocytes in situ and in failing myocardium, but the mechanism by which TLRs may be activated in the failing heart remains unclear. We report that TLR2, which is expressed in cardiac myocytes, participates in the response of these cells to oxidative stress, a major contributor to the pathogenesis of cardiac dysfunction. Hydrogen peroxide increased nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) activation in Chinese hamster ovary fibroblasts that overexpress TLR2 but not in normal or TLR4-overexpressing Chinese hamster ovary cells, an effect that was abrogated by an α-TLR2 antibody. In neonatal rat ventricular myocytes, the α-TLR2 antibody inhibited hydrogen peroxide-induced nuclear translocation of NF-κB and activator protein-1 (AP-1). Inhibition of TLR2 had no effect on tumor necrosis factor α-induced NF-κB or AP-1 activation, on the DNA binding of the basal transcription factor Oct-1, or on hydrogen peroxide-induced phosphorylation of p38 MAP kinase. Importantly, oxidative stress-induced cytotoxicity was enhanced by blocking TLR2. Given the importance of cytotoxicity and apoptosis to the pathology of the ischemic heart, an anti-apoptotic effect of TLR2 in cardiac myocytes exposed to elevated levels of ROS may limit further cardiac dysfunction.

Nature. 1997; 388: 394-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (4437) Google Scholar) were the first to show that constitutively active TLR4 induces the activation of NF-κB with the subsequent expression of IL-1, IL-6, IL-8, and the costimulatory molecule B7.1. Active TLR4 can also induce c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) (6Muzio M. Natoli G. Saccani S. Levrero M. Mantovani A. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 187: 2097-2101Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar). The role of TLRs as innate immunity receptors has been extensively studied. TLR2, for example, is activated by components of Gram-positive bacteria (7Schwandner R. Dziarski R. Wesche H. Rothe M. Kirschning C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274 (1749): 17406Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1432) Google Scholar), mycobacteria (8Brightbill H.D. Libraty D.H. Krutzik S.R. Yang R.B.

Immunol. 1999; 163: 2382-2386Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The most convincing evidence exists for a role of TLR4 in the recognition of bacterial LPS (lipopolysaccharides). Mice with either a spontaneous mutation of the TLR4 gene or targeted disruption of the gene have no response to lipopolysaccharides and are thus resistant to endotoxic shock (11Hoshino K. Takeuchi O. Kawai T. Sanjo H. Ogawa T. Takeda Y. Takeda K. Akira S. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 3749-3752Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Poltorak A. He X. Smirnova I. Liu M.Y. Huffel C.V. Du X. Birdwell D.

Leveque G. Clermont S. Moore K.J. Gros P. Malo D. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 189: 615-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (1354) Google Scholar). In contrast, mice with targeted disruption of TLR2 have no deficit in the recognition of Gram-negative bacteria (14Takeuchi O. Hoshino K. Kawai T. Sanjo H. Takada H. Ogawa T. Takeda K. Akira S. Immunity. 1999; 11: 443-451Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2790) Google Scholar). Interestingly, missense mutations affecting the extracellular domain of the TLR4 receptor are associated with a blunted response to inhaled LPS in humans (15Arbour N.C. Lorenz E. Schutte B.C. Zabner J. Kline J.N. Jones M. Frees K. Watt J.L. Schwartz D.A. Nat. Genet. 2000; 25: 187-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (1785) Google Scholar). Most studies have focused on TLR expression and function in mononuclear cells and monocyte-like cell lines; however, TLRs differentially exhibit a wider pattern of tissue expression, including the lung, heart, and brain (2Schuster J.M. Nelson P.S. J. Leukoc. Biol. 2000; 67: 767-773Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Thus, TLRs may additionally serve as pro-inflammatory receptors in cell types without a dedicated immune function. TLR4, for example, is expressed by human dermal endothelial cells and can activate NF-κB (16Zhang F.X. Kirschning C.J. Mancinelli R. Xu X.P. Jin Y. Faure E. Mantovani A. Rothe M. Muzio M. Arditi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7611-7614Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar). We previously demonstrated (17Frantz S. Kobzik L. Kim Y.D. Fukazawa R. Medzhitov R. Lee R.T. Kelly R.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 104: 271-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar) that TLR4 is expressed in the heart and that injured human and murine myocardium exhibit focal areas of intense TLR4 expression. The reason for this differential expression of TLR4, as well as the function of TLR4 in the injured heart, in the absence of infection, remains unknown. Although the identity of endogenous ligands, analogous toDrosophila spatzle, for the vertebrate TLRs remains elusive, a recent report suggests that the stress-associated factor heat-shock protein 60 signals through TLR4 (18Ohashi K. Burkart V. Flohe S. Kolb H. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 558-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (1368) Google Scholar). Thus, innate immunity receptors may not only be activated by microorganisms, but also by endogenous signals that originate from injured cells that emanate “danger signals” (19Matzinger P. Semin. Immunol. 1998; 10: 399-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (631) Google Scholar). Oxidative stress in the post-ischemic heart has been identified as an important event in myocardial dysfunction, linked to both myocardial hypertrophy and apoptosis. Oxidative stress is known to induce cell death by apoptotic and necrotic pathways in isolated cardiac myocytes (20von Harsdorf R. Li P.F. Dietz R. Circulation. 1999; 99: 2934-2941Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar) and to trigger pro-inflammatory signaling pathways that activate NF-κB and AP-1 transcription factors (21Bowie A. O'Neill L.A. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2000; 59: 13-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (818) Google Scholar, 22Peng M. Huang L. Xie Z.J. Huang W.H. Askari A. Cell Mol. Biol. Res. 1995; 41: 189-197PubMed Google Scholar). Numerous mechanisms are suggested to underlie these effects of hydrogen peroxide, which are likely to be cell type-specific. Herein, we show a requirement of TLR2 for the activation of NF-κB and AP-1 by hydrogen peroxide and provide evidence that TLR2 imparts an anti-apoptotic effect in stressed or injured cardiac myocytes. Human recombinant TNFα was purchased from Endogen (Woburn, MA). All other chemicals, including hydrogen peroxide, were purchased from Sigma Chemical Co. unless noted otherwise. Chinese hamster ovary K1 (CHO-K1) fibroblasts were obtained from D. T. Golenbock (23Lien E. Sellati T.J. Yoshimura A. Flo T.H. Rawadi G. Finberg R.W. Carroll J.D. Espevik T. Ingalls R.R. Radolf J.D.

The cell lines stably express CD-14, an NF-κB-dependent CD25 reporter construct, and empty vector (CHO/control), human TLR2 (CHO/TLR2), or human TLR4 (CHO/TLR4). The cells were maintained as described (23Lien E. Sellati T.J. Yoshimura A. Flo T.H. Rawadi G. Finberg R.W. Carroll J.D. Espevik T. Ingalls R.R. Radolf J.D. Golenbock D.T. J. Biol.

Cells were stimulated as indicated in Ham's F-12 medium containing 10% fetal calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.). Neonatal rat ventricular myocytes (NRVM) were isolated from 1-day-old Harlan Sprague-Dawley pups as described (17Frantz S. Kobzik L. Kim Y.D. Fukazawa R. Medzhitov R. Lee R.T. Kelly R.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 104: 271-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar). NRVM were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.). After 48 h, the medium was changed to Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium /F-12 medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 1% insulin, transferrin, selenium media supplement (ITS, Sigma) with antibiotics. Treatments were initiated 12 h later. CHO fibroblasts and NRVM were pretreated with a TLR-2 blocking antibody raised to a peptide that maps to the amino terminus of human TLR2 (5 or 10 μg/ml, number N-17, Santa Cruz Biotechnologies Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) for 1 h prior to addition of experimental treatments. Expression of rat TLR 1–6 were assessed using total RNA by RT-PCR from NRVM after treatment with deoxyribonuclease 1 (Life Technologies, Inc.) as described in the manufacturer's protocol. cDNA was generated using Superscript II (Life Technologies, Inc.). As a negative control, no reverse transcriptase was added. PCR primers were for TLR1 (383 bp) 5′-AAA CGG TCT CAT CCA CGT TC and 5′-GAG CAA TTG GCA GCA CAC TA, for TLR 2 (298 bp) 5′-GGC CAG CAA ATT ACC TGT GT and 5′-TTC TCC ACC CAG TAG GCA TC, for TLR3 (469 bp) 5′-TGC CTT GGT CCC AAG CCT TCA ACG A and 5′-TGG CCC GAA AAC CTT CTT CTC AAC GGA, for TLR4 and the positive control (555 bp) 5′-CGC TTT CAG CTT TGC CTT CAT TAC and 5′-TGC TAC TTC CTT GTG CCC TGT GAG, for TLR5 (280 bp) 5′-AAG AGG GAA ACC CCA CAG AA and 5′-GGG GAC TAA GCC TCA ACT CC, and for TLR6 (593 bp) 5′-GGG GCT TTC CTC TGT CTC TA and 5′-CCC AAG TTT CAA GTT TTC ACA T. All PCR products were size-fractionated by a 2% agarose gel electrophoresis, and DNA bands were visualized by staining the gel with ethidium bromide. NRVMs were grown in chamber slides (Nunc, Naperville, IL). Cells were fixed with 4% formaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 10 min, washed, and exposed for 10 min to 0.3% Triton X-100 in PBS. After 10-min exposure to 0.1m glycine in PBS, cells were blocked with 5% normal horse serum (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). Cells were labeled by the sequential application of the primary human TLR2 antibody, an anti-goat FITC-conjugated secondary antibody, a second primary rat caveolin 3 antibody (Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY), and a secondary Alexa 568-tagged anti-mouse antibody (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). Images were taken with a confocal laser scanning microscope (model MRC-1024, Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA). The specificity of the primary goat polyclonal anti-hTLR2 antibody was assessed by preincubating the antibody with the hTLR2 matching peptide (Santa Cruz Biotechnologies Inc.). For Western blots, cells were harvested in SDS sample buffer (62.5 mm Tris base, 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 50 mm dithiothreitol). After cell extracts were boiled, equal amounts of the denatured protein per lane were loaded, separated on a 7.5 or 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. After blocking with 5% nonfat dry milk in Tris-buffered saline with 0.1% Tween 20 (TBST), membranes were incubated with anti-hTLR2 (1:500) or anti-p38/phospho p38 (1:100, New England BioLabs, Boston, MA) overnight. After several washes the membranes were incubated for 1 h with a matching secondary antibody (Jackson Laboratories, Bar Harbor, ME; 1:10,000 dilution). After additional washes, membranes were incubated with a chemiluminescent (Renaissance, PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Boston, MA) and autoradiographed. CHO cells were stimulated as indicated in Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum for 24 h. Cells were harvested with trypsin-EDTA and labeled with an FITC CD25 monoclonal antibody (Becton Dickinson Immunocytometry Systems, San Jose, CA). Analysis was performed on 10,000 cells/sample using a FACscan. Cells were treated as indicated for 2 h following pretreatment with the blocking antibody for 1 h. Electromobility shift assays were performed as described elsewhere (24Bourcier T. Baker A.H. Methods in Molecular Medicine, Vascular Disease. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ1999: 159-167Google Scholar). Binding reactions were performed with 10 μg of nuclear protein. The binding reactions for AP-1 activity contained an additional 5 mm MgCl2. Control reaction mixtures contained a 100-fold excess of unlabeled oligonucleotide and were incubated with nuclear extracts as indicated. DNA complexes were separated on a 5% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel in Tris-borate EDTA buffer. NF-κB, AP-1, and Oct-1 oligonucleotides were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnologies. FACS was used to detect cells with a hypodiploid content of DNA and surface expression of phosphatidylserine by staining with FITC-annexin V. NRVM were collected by trypsinization, pooled with nonattached cells, and fixed with ice-cold 70% ethanol/PBS. After being rinsed with PBS, cells were incubated with a propidium iodide (20 μg/ml) solution containing RNase A (5 Kunitz units/ml) at room temperature for 30 min. NRVM in the sub-G1 region were identified using ModFit software, and data are expressed as the percentage of cells in sub-G1. For detection of surface phosphatidylserine, NRVM were collected by trypsinization and directly stained with FITC-annexin V, according to the manufacturer's direction (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA). FACS analysis was performed on 10,000 cells/sample using a FACscan cytometer (Becton Dickinson). All replicate data are expressed as mean and standard error of mean. In experiments with comparison of treatments, an unpaired Student's t test was performed. In experiments with time courses, analysis of variance was used followed by Fisher's post-hoc test. Statistical significance was achieved whenp ≤ 0.05. Statistical analyses were carried out using StatView statistics program (Abacus Concepts, Inc., Berkley, CA). Six human TLR cDNAs have been identified (3Rock F.L. Hardiman G. Timans J.C. Kastelein R.A. Bazan J.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 588-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (1451) Google Scholar, 4Takeuchi O. Kawai T. Sanjo H. Copeland N.G. Gilbert D.J. Jenkins N.A. Takeda K. Akira S. Gene. 1999; 231: 59-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). However, their distribution in cardiac tissue is unknown. TLR2, TLR3, TLR4, and TLR6 were detectable by reverse transcription-PCR in primary NRVM cultures (Fig. 1 a). Signals for TLR1 and TLR5 were absent in cardiac tissue, whereas spleen showed the expected TLR1 and TLR5 bands (data not shown). We previously reported that TLR4 protein is expressed by cardiac myocytes (17Frantz S. Kobzik L. Kim Y.D. Fukazawa R. Medzhitov R. Lee R.T. Kelly R.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 104: 271-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar) but did not explore the expression of TLR2. Using a polyclonal TLR2 antibody, a single band was detected in a TLR2-overexpressing cell line (CHO/TLR2) but not in control (CHO/control) or TLR4-overexpressing (CHO/TLR4) cell lines. A corresponding band could be detected in lysates of neonatal cardiac myocytes (Fig. 1 b). Immunocytochemical staining with the same antibody confirmed the expression of TLR2 in myocytes (Fig.1 c). Primary isolates of neonatal rat ventricular myocytesin vitro exhibited sarcolemmal membrane staining that was inhibited by preincubation with the corresponding TLR2 peptide used to generate the primary antibody. That TLR2-positive cells also expressed caveolin 3 verified their identity as cardiac myocytes. Reactive oxygen intermediates play a key role in cardiac damage following ischemic injury. To investigate a potential role of TLRs in the response to oxidative stress, TLR-expressing CHO cell lines were used. CHO fibroblasts do not express mRNA for full-length and functional TLR2 (25Heine H. Kirschning C. Lien E. Monks B. Rothe M. Golenbock D. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 6971-6975PubMed Google Scholar). The obtained cell lines have previously been characterized (23Lien E. Sellati T.J. Yoshimura A. Flo T.H. Rawadi G. Finberg R.W. Carroll J.D. Espevik T. Ingalls R.R. Radolf J.D. Golenbock D.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33419-33425Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (787) Google Scholar) and overexpress CD14, inducible membrane CD25 under the control of an NF-κB promoter, and empty vector (CHO/control), human TLR2 (CHO/TLR2), or human TLR4 (CHO/TLR4). Oxidative stress was induced by the application of hydrogen peroxide (1 mm). The activity of NF-κB could be monitored by expression of membrane CD25 by flow cytometric analysis. Untreated cells showed nearly equal expression of CD25. TNFα increased CD25 expression evenly in the CHO/control, CHO/TLR2, and CHO/TLR4 lines after 24 h of treatment. However, application of hydrogen peroxide consistently increased NF-κB activity in the CHO/TLR2 cells to a greater extent than in the CHO/control and CHO/TLR4 cell lines (Fig.2 a). In addition, hydrogen peroxide increased nuclear translocation of NF-κB in the CHO/TLR2 line, but was ineffective in the CHO/control line after 2 h of treatment, as measured by EMSA. There was no difference in the amount of nuclear NF-κB for TNFα-treated cells (Fig. 2 b). Moreover, a 1-h preincubation with a TLR2 blocking antibody but not control IgG (data not shown) completely abrogated the nuclear translocation of NF-κB. The binding of Oct-1, a transcription factor that is constitutively expressed, was unchanged by the treatment (Fig.2 c). CHO cells showed a high basal level of nuclear AP-1 by EMSA without treatment, and was unchanged by preincubation with the TLR2 antibody or treatment with hydrogen peroxide (data not shown). These results suggest that TLR2 enhances hydrogen peroxide-induced activation of NF-κB. To test whether TLR2 participates in the response to oxidative stress in cardiac myocytes, NRVM were preincubated with the blocking TLR2 antibody for 1 h and then treated with hydrogen peroxide for another 2 h. As for the CHO cells, the TLR2 blocking antibody could completely abrogate the nuclear translocation of NF-κB (Fig.3 a), whereas preincubation with control IgG was without effect. NF-κB activation by TNFα was unchanged by treatment with the TLR2 blocking antibody. Similar to NF-κB, AP-1 induction by hydrogen peroxide could be blocked by the TLR2 blocking antibody, but not AP-1 induction by TNF-α. The constitutively expressed Oct-1 was unchanged by the treatments. Oxidative stress is also known to rapidly induce the phosphorylation of p38 MAPK in cardiac myocytes (26Guyton K.Z. Liu Y. Gorospe M. Xu Q. Holbrook N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4138-4142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1140) Google Scholar). However, blocking of TLR2 had no effect on hydrogen peroxide-induced p38 phosphorylation after 15 min of treatment (Fig. 3 b). NF-κB activation can elicit anti-apoptotic and pro-apoptotic pathways in various cell types. Whether NF-κB promotes or inhibits apoptosis seems dependent on the type of cell and the type of inducer (27Barkett M. Gilmore T.D. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6910-6924Crossref PubMed Scopus (1076) Google Scholar). Under the conditions of ischemic injury and oxidative stress, NF-κB appears to have an anti-apoptotic role in cardiac myocytes (28Mustapha S. Kirshner A. De Moissac D. Kirshenbaum L.A. Am. J. Physiol. Heart Circ. Physiol. 2000; 279: H939-H945Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To investigate the role of TLR2 in myocyte survival after oxidative stress, NRVM were preincubated with a blocking TLR2 antibody for 1 h and then treated with 0.5 mm hydrogen peroxide. The fraction of myocytes with DNA fragmentation, measured as the percentage of cells in sub-G1 phase, ranged from 6.9 to 10.9% under basal, serum-free conditions over the 6-h incubation. Hydrogen peroxide increased this number to 12 ± 4.6% at 30 min, to a maximum of 33.2 ± 5.9% at 6 h. Preincubation with the TLR2 antibody further increased hydrogen peroxide-induced DNA fragmentation at all time points examined, to a maximum of 40.5 ± 4.9% at 6 h. A nonimmune IgG was without effect (Fig.4 a) on the response to hydrogen peroxide. Annexin V has a strong, specific affinity for phosphatidylserine (PS). Shortly after cells are induced into apoptosis, PS redistributes from the inner to the outer layer of the cell membrane, thus providing a readily detectable marker of dying cells (29Martin S.J. Reutelingsperger C.P. McGahon A.J. Rader J.A. van Schie R.C. LaFace D.M. Green D.R. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 182: 1545-1556Crossref PubMed Scopus (2562) Google Scholar). Basal levels of annexin V-positive cells in these experiments were found to be high, averaging ∼25%. Hydrogen peroxide stimulation had no effect at 30 min but modestly increased annexin V staining of NRVM after 2 h incubation, to 35%. As shown in Fig. 4 b, blockade of TLR2 increased the response to hydrogen peroxide at 30 min (H2O2, 25% versus H2O2+α-TLR2 Ab, 65%), and at 2 h (H2O2, 35% versus H2O2+α-TLR2 Ab, 46%). Pretreatment with a nonimmune IgG was without effect. Thus, blockade of TLR2 inhibits hydrogen peroxide-induced NF-κB and AP-1 activity but enhances hydrogen peroxide-induced DNA fragmentation and PS externalization in NRVM, suggesting an anti-apoptotic function of TLR2 in cardiac myocytes after oxidative stress. The innate immunity system is an evolutionarily ancient and conserved form of the immune system that is triggered by soluble and membrane bound “pattern recognition receptors” (PRR). In the expanded self-nonself model of innate immunity, PRRs have evolved to distinguish between dangerous and innocuous nonself antigens. Therefore, innate immunity recognizes invariant patterns (i.e. pathogen-associated molecular patterns) shared by groups of microorganisms but not by host tissues (30Janeway Jr., C.A. Immunol. Today. 1992; 13: 11-16Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1034) Google Scholar, 31Medzhitov R. Janeway Jr., C.A. Cell. 1997; 91: 295-298Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1972) Google Scholar). A typical pathogen-associated molecular pattern would be bacterial lipopolysaccharides (LPS), for example. However, Matzinger (19Matzinger P. Semin. Immunol. 1998; 10: 399-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (631) Google Scholar, 32Matzinger P. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1994; 12: 991-1045Crossref PubMed Scopus (4013) Google Scholar) has suggested a different explanation for function and triggers of the innate immune system. In the “Danger” model, the immune system would be activated by endogenous “alarm” or “danger” signals, which originate from stressed, injured, or necrotic cells and not by highly conserved structured motifs in pathogens. These danger signals are recognized by the pattern recognition receptors and activate the innate immune system. Therefore, PRRs of the innate immune system would recognize specific epitopes or ligands that indicate injured, dying, or dead cells (i.e. injured/dead self) even in the absence of infection. Signals of “stressed” cells could be sensed by changes in the lipid and/or carbohydrate moieties expressed on the surface of cells or by the presence of proteins not normally found in the outer cell membrane. Increased myocardial expression of inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF, IL-1β, and IL-6, occurs in human and experimental heart failure, seemingly irrespective of initiating events and without evidence of infection (33Kapadia S. Dibbs Z. Kurrelmeyer K. Kalra D. Seta Y. Wang F. Bozkurt B. Oral H. Sivasubramanian N. Mann D.L. Cardiol. Clin. 1998; 16: 645-656Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Although there is a growing consensus that one or more of these proteins contribute to maladaptive cardiac remodeling, the proximal events that trigger and sustain their expression are not well understood. However, each of these cytokines is now known to be related to innate immunity, and their expression may be initiated through activation of specific innate immunity receptors. We have previously shown that TLR4 is expressed in cardiac myocytes and that overexpression of dominant positive TLR4 activates NF-κB. In normal murine and human myocardium, TLR4 expression was diffuse and predominantly expressed in cardiac myocytes. However, in both “remodeling” murine and human myocardium remote from sites of ischemic injury and in heart tissue from patients with idiopathic congestive heart failure, focal areas of intense TLR4 staining in myocytes could be detected (17Frantz S. Kobzik L. Kim Y.D. Fukazawa R. Medzhitov R. Lee R.T. Kelly R.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 104: 271-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar). Therefore, pattern recognition receptors, as for example TLRs, may be important to trigger activation of the innate immune system in congestive heart failure and may have an important pathogenic role. In this report, we provide evidence for a function of the TLR2 receptor, which is also expressed in unstimulated cardiac myocytes. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are proposed to be a major pathogenic factor for hypoxic and ischemic damage in the heart. To confer oxidative stress in vitro, hydrogen peroxide was used in neonatal rat ventricular myocytes. Several lines of evidence are developed that document TLR2's role in the nuclear translocation of NF-κB after stimulation with hydrogen peroxide. First, hydrogen peroxide increased NF-κB activity and nuclear translocation in CHO cells that overexpress TLR2 but not in CHO cells that lack a functional TLR2 or that overexpress TLR4. Second, an anti-TLR2 antibody, but not a nonimmune IgG, abrogated hydrogen peroxide-induced activation of NF-κB and AP-1 in TLR2-overexpressing CHO cells and NRVM. Several experiments discount any nonspecific effect of the TLR2 antibody: 1) a single immunoreactive band was present in NRVM that corresponded to a band in CHO/TLR2 cell lysates, 2) TNFα-induced NF-κB and AP-1 activity was unaffected by the antibody, 3) DNA binding of the constitutive transcription factor OCT-1 was unaffected, and 4) hydrogen peroxide-induced phosphorylation of p38 MAPK was similarly unaffected by the TLR2 antibody. Thus, from these criteria, we suggest that hydrogen peroxide triggers NF-κB and AP-1 activation through a mechanism that involves TLR2. Oxidative stress has long been known to induce NF-κB and has been thought to be crucial for NF-κB activation in the cell (reviewed in Ref. 21Bowie A. O'Neill L.A. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2000; 59: 13-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (818) Google Scholar). However, the recently characterized IL-1 and TNF pathways activate NF-κB independent of ROS, and the activation of NF-κB by ROS seems to be distinct from IL-1 and TNF. Moreover, different cell types respond to H2O2 in different ways. The kinetics for NF-κB activation by H2O2 are slow and may therefore be characteristic for a secondary response of NF-κB to agents that induce stress. An exact pathway for NF-κB activation by ROS has not been characterized yet, but may involve direct phosphorylation of tyrosine at position 42 on IκBα (reviewed in Refs. 21Bowie A. O'Neill L.A. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2000; 59: 13-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (818) Google Scholar, 34Flohe L. Brigelius-Flohe R. Saliou C. Traber M.G. Packer L. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1997; 22: 1115-1126Crossref PubMed Scopus (760) Google Scholar, 35Muller J.M. Rupec R.A. Baeuerle P.A. Methods. 1997; 11: 301-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). The current results suggest an alternative pathway, whereby H2O2 activates a surface receptor, TLR2, which in turn triggers the signaling events that degrade IκB and activate NF-κB. The IL1R-like pathway utilized by TLR2 to activate NF-κB has recently been reported (36Yang R.B. Mark M.R. Gurney A.L. Godowski P.J. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 639-643PubMed Google Scholar). What is the mechanism by which H2O2 activates TLR2? It seems unlikely that H2O2 would directly interact with TLR2 in a classical ligand/receptor complex. However, hydrogen peroxide can modify membrane components and is a known inducer of apoptosis and necrosis in cardiac myocytes (28Mustapha S. Kirshner A. De Moissac D. Kirshenbaum L.A. Am. J. Physiol. Heart Circ. Physiol. 2000; 279: H939-H945Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 37Turner N.A. Xia F. Azhar G. Zhang X. Liu L. Wei J.Y. J. Mol. Cell Cardiol. 1998; 30: 1789-1801Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). We suggest that cell death or injury could have caused the release of one or more factors that interact with and activate TLR2. Such a mechanism complements the delayed time course of H2O2-induced NF-κB activation and is reminiscent of the “alarm” or “danger” signals that activate innate immunity as outlined by Matzinger (19Matzinger P. Semin. Immunol. 1998; 10: 399-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (631) Google Scholar). In support of this, a recent report demonstrated that endogenous heat shock protein 60 (HSP60) may function as a ligand for TLR4 (18Ohashi K. Burkart V. Flohe S. Kolb H. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 558-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (1368) Google Scholar). HSPs are known to induce NF-κB (38Kol A. Bourcier T. Lichtman A.H. Libby P. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 571-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar). Of note, we could demonstrate 2S. Frantz, R. A. Kelly, and T. Bourcier, unpublished observations. the release of HSP60 in the supernatant of cardiac myocytes treated with H2O2, thus verifying that H2O2 can elicit release of a potential TLR ligand in NRVM. Further experiments are necessary and currently underway to address this hypothesis. What function could H2O2-induced activation of TLR have in cardiac myocytes? Nuclear translocation of NF-κB occurs following activation of TLR2 (36Yang R.B. Mark M.R. Gurney A.L. Godowski P.J. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 639-643PubMed Google Scholar). NF-κB then directs transcription of a variety of genes, including those related to apoptosis (27Barkett M. Gilmore T.D. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6910-6924Crossref PubMed Scopus (1076) Google Scholar). A pro-apoptotic role of TLR2 has been proposed in a monocytic cell line (39Aliprantis A.O. Yang R.B. Mark M.R. Suggett S. Devaux B. Radolf J.D. Klimpel G.R. Godowski P. Zychlinsky A. Science. 1999; 285: 736-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (1276) Google Scholar, 40Aliprantis A.O. Yang R.B. Weiss D.S. Godowski P. Zychlinsky A. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3325-3336Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar). However, the function of NF-κB in cell death is highly dependent on the type of cell as well as the type of inducer (27Barkett M. Gilmore T.D. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6910-6924Crossref PubMed Scopus (1076) Google Scholar). Blockade of TLR2 increased the rate of hydrogen peroxide-induced apoptosis and injury in NRVM, based on two independent measures of cytotoxicity and apoptosis, hypodiploidy and externalization of phosphatidylserine. Therefore, TLR2 may have an anti-apoptotic function in the heart. In heart failure as well as after myocardial infarction, necrosis and apoptosis have a major pathogenetic role in the development of ventricular dysfunction (41Anversa P. Leri A. Beltrami C.A. Guerra S. Kajstura J. Lab. Invest. 1998; 78: 767-786PubMed Google Scholar, 42Haunstetter A. Izumo S. Circ. Res. 1998; 82: 1111-1129Crossref PubMed Scopus (723) Google Scholar). Considering that we have seen increased levels of TLR expression specifically in the border zones between viable and damaged myocardium after infarction (17Frantz S. Kobzik L. Kim Y.D. Fukazawa R. Medzhitov R. Lee R.T. Kelly R.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 104: 271-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar),2 one could speculate that activation of TLRs play a role in the protection of ischemic but viable myocardium. In summary, TLR2 participates importantly to the mechanism of hydrogen peroxide-induced activation of NF-κB and AP-1 in NRVM. We suggest that activation of TLR2 is triggered by hydrogen peroxide-generated endogenous signals that may increase survival of cardiac myocytes after oxidative stress. We thank Dr. D. T. Golenbock for the gift of the CHO cell lines, and Dr. Min-Ying Pu for excellent technical assistance."

We show how both types of observations can be explained by a layer of silicate sediments, which accumulate at the top of the core as Earth cools. Compaction of the sediments expels most of the liquid iron but leaves behind a small amount of core material, which is entrained in mantle convection and may account for the isotopic signatures of core material in some hot spot plumes. Extraction of light elements from the liquid core also enhances the vigor of convection in the core and may increase the power available to the geodynamo."
https://openalex.org/W1968952749,"In this study we have demonstrated that both CD44 (the hyaluronan (HA) receptor) and c-Src kinase are expressed in human ovarian tumor cells (SK-OV-3.ipl cell line), and that these two proteins are physically associated as a complex in vivo. Using a recombinant cytoplasmic domain of CD44 and anin vitro binding assay, we have detected a specific interaction between CD44 and c-Src kinase. Furthermore, the binding of HA to SK-OV-3.ipl cells promotes c-Src kinase recruitment to CD44 and stimulates c-Src kinase activity, which, in turn, increases tyrosine phosphorylation of the cytoskeletal protein, cortactin. Subsequently, tyrosine phosphorylation of cortactin attenuates its ability to cross-link filamentous actin in vitro. In addition, transfection of SK-OV-3.ipl cells with a dominant active form of c-Src (Y527F)cDNA promotes CD44 and c-Src association with cortactin in membrane projections, and stimulates HA-dependent/CD44-specific ovarian tumor cell migration. Finally, overexpression of a dominant-negative mutant of c-Src kinase (K295R) in SK-OV-3.ipl cells impairs the tumor cell-specific phenotype. Taken together, these findings strongly suggest that CD44 interaction with c-Src kinase plays a pivotal role in initiating cortactin-regulated cytoskeleton function and HA-dependent tumor cell migration, which may be required for human ovarian cancer progression.

Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 391-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (676) Google Scholar). Recent studies indicate that the binding of ECM components (e.g. HA) promote CD44-mediated Tiam1-Rac1 signaling and cytoskeleton function leading to specific structural changes in the plasma membrane and tumor cell migration in metastatic tumor cells (18Bourguignon L.Y.W. Zhu H. Shao L. Chen Y.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1829-1838Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). These findings strongly suggest that the CD44 molecule provides a direct linkage between the ECM and the cytoskeleton. In particular, the coordinated oncogenic signaling processes contributed by HA-dependent and CD44-mediated cytoskeleton activation is considered to be a possible mechanism underlying tumor cell motility and migration: an obvious prerequisite for metastasis. The Src family kinases are classified as oncogenic proteins due to their ability to activate cell proliferation (24Barone M.V. Courtneidge S.A.

Elliott B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33714-33721Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). The amino terminus of Src contains a myristoylation (or palmitoylation) site, which is important for membrane association (31Thomas S.M. Brugge J.S. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 513-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (2134) Google Scholar, 32Schlessinger J. Cell. 2000; 100: 293-296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Src also contains several functional domains including Src homology (SH) 3 and SH2 domains, the catalytic protein-tyrosine kinase core, and a conserved regulatory tyrosine phosphorylation site (31Thomas S.M. Brugge J.S. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 513-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (2134) Google Scholar,32Schlessinger J. Cell. 2000; 100: 293-296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Certain amino acid residues in the c-Src molecule play an important role in modulating its kinase activity. Mutations of specific key amino acids result in either up-regulation or down-regulation of c-Src kinase activity. For example, replacement of tyrosine 527 with phenylalanine (e.g. Y527F, the dominant-active form of c-Src kinase) strongly activates c-Src kinase tranforming capability and enzyme activities (33Kmiecik T.E. Shalloway D. Cell. 1987; 49: 65-73Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). Mutation of lysine 295 to arginine (e.g. K295R, the dominant-negative form of c-Src kinase) renders c-Src kinase defective and reduces c-Src kinase-mediated biological activities (33Kmiecik T.E. Shalloway D. Cell. 1987; 49: 65-73Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar, 34Bagrodia S. Chackalaparampil I. Kmiecik T.E. Shalloway D. Nature. 1991; 349: 172-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). In addition, it has been observed that the interaction between Src kinase and membrane-linked molecules regulates receptor signaling and various cellular functions (31Thomas S.M. Brugge J.S. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 513-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (2134) Google Scholar, 32Schlessinger J. Cell. 2000; 100: 293-296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). In fact, CD44s-mediated cellular signaling has been suggested to involve Src kinase family members (35Taher T.E. Smit L. Griffioen A.W. Schilder-Tol E.J. Borst J. Pals S.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2863-2867Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). For example, Lck, one of the Src kinase family members, is found to be closely complexed with CD44s during T-cell activation (35Taher T.E. Smit L. Griffioen A.W. Schilder-Tol E.J. Borst J. Pals S.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2863-2867Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). CD44 also selectively associates with active Src family tyrosine kinases (e.g. Lck and Fyn) in glycosphingolipid-rich plasma membrane domains of human peripheral blood lymphocytes (36Ilangumaran S. Briol A. Hoessli D.C. Blood. 1998; 92: 3901-3908Crossref Google Scholar). Moreover, the cytoplasmic domain of CD44s has been shown to be involved in the recruitment of the Src family (e.g. Src, Yes, and Fyn) in prostate tumor cells during anchorage-independent colony growth (20Zhu D. Bourguignon L.Y.W. Cell Motil. Cytoskel. 1998; 39: 209-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). Collectively, all these observations support the notion that c-Src kinases participate in CD44-mediated cellular signaling. The questions of (i) whether CD44s-mediated c-Src kinase signaling plays a direct role in regulating ovarian tumor cell activation and (ii) which cytoskeletal protein(s) is (are) most likely involved in CD44-c-Src kinase-regulated downstream effector function leading to human ovarian cell migration are specifically addressed in this study. We have determined that CD44s (the standard form) and c-Src kinase are physically linked and functionally coupled in human ovarian tumor cells (SK-OV-3.ipl cell line). Furthermore, our data show that the cytoplasmic domain of CD44s is important for the association with c-Src kinase. HA treatment of ovarian tumor cells recruits c-Src kinase to CD44s and activates c-Src kinase activity. We have also demonstrated that c-Src kinase phosphorylates the cytoskeletal protein cortactin both in vivo and in vitro. Most importantly, cortactin phosphorylation by c-Src kinase attenuates its cross-linking ability of filamentous actin. Overexpression of a dominant-active form of c-Src kinase, by transfecting SK-OV-3.ipl cells with c-Src (Y527F)cDNA in these ovarian tumor cells, promotes the onset of CD44s/c-Src kinase-regulated cortactin function and tumor cell migration. Transfection of SK-OV-3.ipl cells with a dominant-negative mutant of c-Src kinase (K295R-kinase dead) effectively blocks the tumor cell-specific phenotype. Therefore, we believe that CD44-activated c-Src kinase signaling is directly involved in stimulating cortactin-cytoskeleton interaction and HA-mediated tumor cell migration during the progression of human ovarian cancer. The SK-OV-3.ipl cell line was established from ascites that developed in a nu/nu mouse given an intraperitoneal injection of SK-OV-3 human ovarian carcinoma cell line (obtained from the American Type Culture Collection) as described previously (37Yu D. Wolf J.K. Scanlon M. Price J.E. Hung M.C. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 891-898PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 medium supplement (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Monoclonal rat anti-CD44 antibody (clone 020; isotype IgG2b; obtained from CMB-TECH, Inc., Miami, FL) used in this study recognizes the standard form of CD44 (CD44s). Monoclonal mouse anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (PY-plus™; clone PY20; IgG2b) was purchased from Zymed Laboratories Inc. (South San Francisco, CA). Rabbit polyclonal antibody against human c-Src kinase (recognizing a peptide sequence corresponding to amino acids 509–533 at the carboxyl terminus of human c-Src p60) and rabbit anti-Src (Tyr(P)418) phosphospecific antibody were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA) and BIOSOURCE International (Camarillo, CA), respectively. Mouse monoclonal anti-green fluorescent protein (GFP) antibody and mouse monoclonal anti-cortactin antibody (clone 4F11) were purchased from PharMingen (San Diego, CA) and Upstate Biotechnology Inc. (Lake Placid, NY), respectively. The procedure for preparing the fusion protein of CD44's cytoplasmic domain was the same as described previously (9Zhu D. Bourguignon L.Y.W. J. Cell. Physiol. 2000; 183: 182-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 17Bourguignon L.Y.W. Zhu H. Shao L. Zhu D. Chen Y.W. Cell Motil. Cytoskel. 1999; 43: 269-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). The c-Src (Y527F) mutant or the c-Src (K295R) mutant cDNAs (kindly provided by Dr. David Shalloway (Cornell University, Ithaca, NY) was cloned into pEGFPN1 vector (CLONTECH) using PCR-based cloning strategy. Specifically, c-Src (Y527F) mutant cDNA or c-Src (K295R) mutant cDNA was amplified by PCR with two specific primers (left, 5′-GCCTCGAGATGGGGAGCAGCAAGAGCAAG-3′; right, 5′-GCAAGCTTTAGGTTCTCTCCAGGCTGGTA-3′) linked with a specific enzyme digestion site (XhoI or HindIII). PCR product digested with XhoI and HindIII was purified with QIAquick PCR purification kit (Quagen). The cDNA was cloned into pEGFPN1 vector digested with XhoI and HindIII. Subsequently, both c-Src (Y527F) mutant cDNA and c-Src (K295R) mutant cDNA sequences were confirmed by nucleotide sequencing analyses. To establish a transient expression system, SK-OV-3.ipl cells were transfected with various plasmid DNAs (e.g. GFP-tagged c-Src (Y527F) or GFP-c-Src (K295R) or vector alone) using electroporation methods according to those procedures described previously (38Chu G. Hayakawa H. Berg P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 1311-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar). Various transfectants were then analyzed for their protein expression (e.g. c-Src-related proteins) by immunoblot, c-Src kinase activity, and tumor cell migration assays as described below. Purified constitutively activated c-Src kinase recombinant protein (39Boyle W.J. van der Geer P. Hunter T. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 110-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (1272) Google Scholar) was first bound to anti-c-Src kinase-conjugated immunoaffinity beads. Subsequently, aliquots (10–20 ng of proteins) of these beads were incubated with 0.5 ml of a binding buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, and 0.05% Triton X-100) in the presence of various concentrations (10–400 ng/ml) of 125I-labeled FLAG-CD44cyt fusion protein (5,000 cpm/ng protein) at 4 °C for 5 h. Specifically, equilibrium binding conditions were determined by performing a time course (1–10 h) of 125I-labeled FLAG-CD44cyt binding to c-Src kinase at 4 °C. The binding equilibrium was found to be established when the in vitroCD44-c-Src kinase binding assay was conducted at 4 °C after 4 h. Following binding, beads were washed extensively in the binding buffer and the bead-bound radioactivity was counted. As a control, 125I-labeled FLAG-CD44cyt fusion protein was also incubated with uncoated beads to determine the binding observed due to the nonspecific binding of the ligand. Nonspecific binding, which represented ∼15–20% of the total binding, was always subtracted from the total binding. The values expressed under “Results” represent an average of triplicate determinations of three to five experiments with S.D. less than ±5%. SK-OV-3.ipl cells were solubilized in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100 buffer and immunoprecipitated using rat anti-CD44s antibody or rabbit anti-c-Src kinase antibody followed by goat anti- rat IgG or goat anti-rabbit IgG, respectively. The immunoprecipitated material was solubilized in SDS sample buffer, electrophoresed, and immunoblotted with rabbit anti-c-Src kinase antibody (5 μg/ml) or rat anti-CD44s antibody (5 μg/ml), followed by incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG or goat anti-rat IgG (1:10,000 dilution) at room temperature for 1 h. The blots were developed using ECL chemiluminescence reagent (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cell lysates were also prepared from SK-OV-3.ipl cells treated with HA at various concentrations (e.g. 0, 5, 10, 25, 50, and 100 μg/ml) for various time intervals (e.g. 0, 2, 5, 10, 15, 20, 30, and 60 min) and immunoprecipitated with anti-CD44s IgG to isolate CD44s-c-Src kinase complex (as described above). Immunoprecipitates were immunoblotted with either anti-Src (Tyr(P)418) (5 μg/ml) or anti-c-Src kinase (5 μg/ml). In some cases, SK-OV-3.ipl cells (treated with HA (50 μg/ml) for 10–60 min in the absence or the presence of PP2, an inhibitor for c-Src family kinases (purchased form Calbiochem-Novabiochem, San Diego, CA); or untreated) were solubilized in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100 buffer. These materials were then immunoprecipitated by mouse anti-cortactin, followed by immunoblotting with mouse anti-phosphotyrosine antibody/or reblotting with mouse anti-cortactin plus peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG and ECL chemiluminescence reagent. In some experiments, SK-OV-3.ipl cells (e.g. untransfected or transfected by GFP-tagged c-Src (Y527F)cDNA or GFP-tagged c-Src (K295R)cDNA or vector alone) were treated with HA (50 μg/ml) for 10–60 min. Cell lysates of these transfectants were immunoprecipitated by rat anti-CD44s antibody (5 μg/ml). The anti-CD44s-mediated immunoprecipitated material was then immunoblotted with mouse anti-GFP antibody (5 μg/ml) for 1 h at room temperature. Some cell lysate was either immunoblotted with mouse anti-GFP antibody (5 μg/ml) or immunoprecipitated with mouse anti-GFP antibody (5 μg/ml), followed by immunoblotting with rabbit anti-c-Src antibody (5 μg/ml). In some cases, the cell lysate of these cells was immunoprecipitated by mouse anti-cortactin (5 μg/ml), followed by immunoblotting with mouse anti-phosphotyrosine antibody/reblotting with mouse anti-cortactin antibody plus horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (1:10,000 dilution) and ECL chemiluminescence reagent. SK-OV-3.ipl cells (untransfected or transfected with various plasmid DNAs such as GFP-tagged c-Src (Y527F)cDNA or GFP-tagged c-Src (K295R)cDNA or vector alone) were first washed with PBS (0.1 m phosphate buffer (pH 7.5) and 150 mm NaCl) buffer and fixed by 2% paraformaldehyde. Subsequently, untransfected/vector-transfected cells or GFP-tagged SK-OV-3.ipl transfectants were stained with Texas Red-labeled or cyanine (Cy5)-labeled rat anti-CD44s antibody. In some cases, GFP-tagged and cyanine-labeled cells were then rendered permeable by ethanol treatment, followed by incubating with Texas Red-conjugated mouse anti-cortactin IgG. To detect nonspecific antibody binding, cyanine-CD44s labeled cells were incubated with Texas Red-conjugated normal mouse IgG. No labeling was observed in such control samples. These labeled samples were examined with a confocal laser scanning microscope (MultiProbe 2001 Inverted CLSM system, Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). Cells displaying membrane projections were counted under the microscope. Specifically, every cell in the field was examined for the occurrence of the cell phenotypes (e.g. with or without membrane projections). At least 200–300 cells (in 12 different fields) were examined in each sample. Quantitative values describing the percentage of cells displaying membrane projections in each sample were expressed as “percentage of total cells.” Twenty-four transwell units were used for monitoring in vitro cell migration as described previously (9Zhu D. Bourguignon L.Y.W. J. Cell. Physiol. 2000; 183: 182-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 17Bourguignon L.Y.W. Zhu H. Shao L. Zhu D. Chen Y.W. Cell Motil.

SK-OV-3.ipl cells (untransfected or transfected with GFP-tagged c-Src (Y527F)cDNA or GFP-tagged c-Src (K295R)cDNA or vector alone) (∼1 × 104cells/well) were placed in the upper chamber of the transwell unit. The growth medium containing high glucose DMEM supplemented with 200 μg/ml hyaluronic acid was placed in the lower chamber of the transwell unit. After 18 h of incubation at 37 °C in a humidified 95% air, 5% CO2 atmosphere, vital stain MTT (Sigma) was added at a final concentration of 0.2 mg/ml to both the upper and the lower chambers and incubated for additional 4 h at 37 °C. Migrative cells at the lower part of the filter were removed by swabbing with small pieces of Whatman filter paper. Both the polycarbonate filter and the Whatman paper were placed in dimethyl sulfoxide to solubilize the crystal. Color intensity was measured in 450 nm. Cell migration processes were determined by measuring the cells that migrate from then upper chambers to the lower side of the polycarbonate filters by standard cell number counting methods as described previously (9Zhu D. Bourguignon L.Y.W. J. Cell. Physiol. 2000; 183: 182-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 17Bourguignon L.Y.W. Zhu H. Shao L. Zhu D. Chen Y.W. Cell Motil.

The CD44-specific cell migration was determined by subtracting nonspecific cell migration (i.e.cells migrate to the lower chamber in the presence of anti-CD44s antibody treatment) from the total migrative cells in the lower chamber. The CD44-specific cell migration in vector-transfected cells (control) is designated as 100%. Each assay was set up in triplicate and repeated at least three times. All data were analyzed statistically using Student's t test, and statistical significance was set at p < 0.01. An in vitro c-Src kinase assay using enolase as a substrate was performed as described previously (40Atfi A. Drobetsky E. Boissonneault M. Chapdelaine A. Chevalier S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30688-30693Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, lysates from SK-OV-3.ipl cells (treated with HA (50 μg/ml) for 10–60 min; or pretreated with anti-CD44 followed by HA (50 μg/ml) treatment for 10–60 min; or untreated) were prepared and processed for anti-CD44-mediated or anti-c-Src kinase-mediated immunoprecipitation to obtain the CD44s-c-Src kinase complexes. For assaying c-Src kinase activity, CD44s-c-Src kinase complexes were incubated with 10 μl of reaction buffer (20 mm PIPES (pH 7.0), 10 mm MnCl2, 10 μm Na3VO4)), 1 μl of freshly prepared acid-denatured enolase (Sigma) (5 μg of enolase plus 1 μl of 50 mm HCl incubated at 30 °C for 10 min and then neutralized with 1 μl of 1 m PIPES (pH 7.0)), and 20 mm ATP. After 10 min of incubation at 30 °C, reactions were terminated by adding 2× SDS sample buffer. Samples were then electrophoresed and immunoblotted with mouse anti-phosphotyrosine antibody plus horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG and ECL chemiluminescence reagent. Untransfected SK-OV-3.ipl cells and various transfectants were treated with HA (50 μg/ml) for various time intervals (0, 2, 5, 10, 15, 20, 30, and 60 min). At each time point, 100 mm c-Src-related proteins (isolated from HA-treated untransfected cells using anti-c-Src-conjugated immunoaffinity beads, or SK-OV-3.ipl cells transfected with either c-Src (Y527F) or c-Src (K295R) or vector alone using anti-GFP-conjugated Sepharose beads) were incubated with 20 μl of the reaction buffer (20 mm PIPES (pH 7.0), 10 mmMnCl2, 10 μmNa3VO4)), 1 μl of recombinant cortactin (a gift from Dr. Alan Mak, Queen's University, Kingston, Ontario, Canada) (5 μg of cortactin dissolved in 2 μl of 1 m PIPES (pH 7.0)), and 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (5000 Ci/mmol) at 30 °C for 1 h. To quantitate phosphorylated cortactin, aliquots of the reactions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The radioactivity associated with GFP-tagged cortactin band w"

We have shown that a globular domain at the C terminus of subunit RPA32 contains a specific surface that interacts in a similar manner with the DNA repair enzyme UNG2 and repair factors XPA and RAD52, each of which functions in a different repair pathway. NMR structures of the RPA32 domain, free and in complex with the minimal interaction domain of UNG2, were determined, defining a common structural basis for linking RPA to the nucleotide excision, base excision, and recombinational pathways of repairing damaged DNA. Our findings support a hand-off model for the assembly and coordination of different components of the DNA repair machinery."
https://openalex.org/W2108527886,"The cell wall of pathogenic mycobacteria is abundant with complex glycolipids whose roles in disease pathogenesis are mostly unknown. Here, we provide evidence for the involvement of the specific trisaccharide unit of the phenolic glycolipid-1 (PGL-1) of Mycobacterium leprae in determining the bacterial predilection to the peripheral nerve. PGL-1 binds specifically to the native laminin-2 in the basal lamina of Schwann cell-axon units. This binding is mediated by the α2LG1, α2LG4, and α2LG5 modules present in the naturally cleaved fragments of the peripheral nerve laminin α2 chain, and is inhibited by the synthetic terminal trisaccharide of PGL-1. PGL-1 is involved in the M. leprae invasion of Schwann cells through the basal lamina in a laminin-2-dependent pathway. The results indicate a novel role of a bacterial glycolipid in determining the nerve predilection of a human pathogen."
https://openalex.org/W1981276271,"We previously reported that versican, a large chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan, isolated from a renal adenocarcinoma cell line, ACHN, binds L-selectin. Here we report that versican also binds certain chemokines and regulates chemokine function. This binding was strongly inhibited by the chondroitinase digestion of versican or by the addition of soluble chondroitin sulfate (CS) B, CS E, or heparan sulfate. Furthermore, these glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) could bind directly to the chemokines that bind versican. Thus, versican appears to interact with chemokines via its GAGs. We next examined if versican or GAGs affect secondary lymphoid tissue chemokine (SLC)-induced integrin activation and Ca2+ mobilization in lymphoid cells expressing a receptor for SLC, CC chemokine receptor 7. Interestingly, whereas heparan sulfate supported both α4β7 integrin-dependent binding to mucosal addressin cell adhesion molecule-1 (MAdCAM-1)-IgG and Ca2+ mobilization induced by SLC, versican or CS B inhibited these cellular responses, and the extent of inhibition was dependent on the dose of versican or CS B added. These findings suggest that different proteoglycans have different functions in the regulation of chemokine activities and that versican may negatively regulate the function of SLC via its GAG chains. We previously reported that versican, a large chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan, isolated from a renal adenocarcinoma cell line, ACHN, binds L-selectin. Here we report that versican also binds certain chemokines and regulates chemokine function. This binding was strongly inhibited by the chondroitinase digestion of versican or by the addition of soluble chondroitin sulfate (CS) B, CS E, or heparan sulfate. Furthermore, these glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) could bind directly to the chemokines that bind versican. Thus, versican appears to interact with chemokines via its GAGs.

These GAGs have a large number of sulfate or carboxyl groups and, hence, have a strong negative charge, which makes it possible for proteoglycans to bind through their GAG chains various positively charged molecules such as certain growth factors, cytokines, and chemokines (1Kjellén L.

This interaction in the extracellular matrix or on the cell surface has been suggested to play important roles in vivo in the formation of immobilized gradients of these humoral factors, in their protection from proteolytic degradation, and in their presentation to specific cell-surface receptors (3Ruoslahti E.

There is an increasing body of evidence indicating that HS proteoglycans are particularly important in promoting the oligomerization of chemokines and in facilitating their presentation to specific receptors (6Hoogewerf A.J.

Sporadic reports indicate that CS proteoglycans may also have this function (9Petersen F. Bock L. Flad H.-D. Brandt E. J. Immuol. 1998; 161: 4347-4355PubMed Google Scholar, 10Wolff E.A. Greenfield B.

For instance, CS proteoglycans on human neutrophils specifically bind platelet factor 4 and are involved in the activation of neutrophils (9Petersen F. Bock L. Flad H.-D. Brandt E. J.

An artificial proteoglycan modified with CS binds RANTES via its GAGs, which also induces the activation of T cells expressing this molecule on their surface (10Wolff E.A. Greenfield B. Taub D.D.

Thus, not only HS but also CS proteoglycans appear to bind chemokines and to play important roles in the regulation of chemokine functions. Versican is a large CS proteoglycan (11Zimmermann D.R.

We have recently reported that versican derived from a renal adenocarcinoma cell line, ACHN, interacts through its CS chains with leukocyte adhesion molecules such as L-selectin and CD44 (14Kawashima H.

Cancer Res. 1997; 71: 241-319Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Since versican has abundant CS side chains and is secreted into the extracellular matrix, we speculated that it might also interact with certain chemokines to help form haptotactic gradients in the tissues where chemokines and versican are colocalized. In the present study we examined the ability of versican to bind a large panel of chemokines and the biological consequences of such binding. Our results indicate that versican can bind specific chemokines through its CS chains and that the binding tends to down-regulate the chemokine function. This raises the possibility that different proteoglycans have different functions in the regulation of chemokine activities and that certain proteoglycans, such as versican, may negatively regulate chemokine functions. Versican was isolated from the culture supernatant of a human renal adenocarcinoma cell line, ACHN, as described previously (14Kawashima H. Li Y.-F. Watanabe N. Hirose J. Hirose M. Miyasaka M. Int.

The human acute T cell leukemia Jurkat cells were also cultured in RPMI-FCS. The L1.2 cells stable-expressing transfected human CCR7 (L1.2/CCR7) was generated as described previously (21Imai T.

Various concentrations of chemokines were spotted onto a Hybond C nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and air-dried for 5 h. The membrane was blocked overnight with 3% BSA, 0.1% NaN3 in PBS at 4 °C. After blocking, the membrane was washed with PBS containing 1 mmCaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2 (PBS+) containing 0.05% Tween 20, and 0.1% BSA. Subsequently, the membrane was incubated with biotinylated versican (3 μg/ml) in the presence or absence of various GAGs (10 μg/ml) for 1 h at room temperature. After washing, ABC reagent (Vector Laboratories Inc., Burlingame, CA) was applied, and bound versican was detected using ECL (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Versican (20 μg/ml) or GAGs (50 μg/ml) were coated on 4-mm-diameter 96-well EIA/RIA plates (Costar, Corning Inc.) overnight at 4 °C. The wells were washed with PBS+, and blocked with FCS for 2 h at room temperature. SLC was added to the versican- or GAG-coated wells and incubated for 2 h. After washing, the wells were incubated with biotinylated goat anti-human SLC (1 μg/ml, DAKO) in PBS+ containing 0.05% Tween 20 and 1% FCS for 1 h at room temperature. After washing, the wells were incubated with streptavidin-conjugated alkaline phosphatase (1:500, Promega, Madison, WI) for 1 h. To quantify the reaction, Blue Phos™ (Kirkegaard Perry Laboratories, Gaithersburg, MD) was added, and the optical density was read at 620 nm in a microtiter plate reader (InterMed, Tokyo, Japan). To determine the binding of MCP-1 to versican, versican (20 μg/ml) was coated on 4-mm-diameter 96-well EIA/RIA plates (Costar, Corning Inc.) overnight at 4 °C. The wells were washed with PBS+ and blocked with 3% BSA in PBS+ for 2 h at room temperature. MCP-1 (0–3 μg/ml) was added to the versican-coated wells and incubated for 2 h. After washing, the wells were incubated with biotinylated goat anti-human MCP-1 (1 μg/ml, Santa Cruz, Biotechnology Inc. Santa Cruz, CA) and then with peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin in PBS+ containing 0.1% BSA and 0.05% Tween 20 for 1 h at room temperature. To quantify the reaction, o-phenylenediamine (0.4 mg/ml) was used as the substrate, and the optical density at 490 nm was read in a microtiter plate reader. In some experiments, immobilized versican was treated with chondroitinase ABC (0.6 units/ml, pH 8.0), chondroitinase B (0.06 units/ml, pH 8.0), or keratanase (0.6 units/ml, pH 8.0) overnight at 37 °C. After blocking, SLC (1 μg/ml) was added to the wells and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. After washing, bound SLC was detected with streptavidin-conjugated alkaline phosphatase and Blue Phos™ as described above. To examine the efficacy of the enzyme digestion, either mAb 2B1 (3 μg/ml) or CS56 (1:500 dilutions) was added to the wells after the enzyme treatment. Peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG or anti-mouse IgG + IgM was then added to detect the binding of the primary antibodies. The binding was quantified by theo-phenylenediamine reaction as described above. Cell adhesion to MAdCAM-1 induced by SLC was determined as follows. SLC (0–3 μg/ml) and MAdCAM-1-IgG (100 ng/well) or human IgG (100 ng/well) were coimmobilized on 4-mm-diameter 96-well EIA/RIA plates (Costar, Corning Inc.) overnight at 4 °C. After washing twice with PBS, plates were blocked with FCS. TK-1 cells labeled with 2′,7′-bis-(2-carboxyethyl)-5-(and 6)carboxyfluorescein acetoxymethyl ester (BCECF-AM) (2 μm) were then added to the wells (1.2 × 105 cells/well) in triplicate. After a 20-min incubation at 37 °C, the wells were filled with RPMI-FCS and sealed with Parafilm. The plates were inverted for 30 min at 37 °C to allow nonadherent cells to detach from the bottom surface of the wells, after which the medium containing unbound cells was removed by suction. The remaining bound cells were lysed with 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and the fluorescence intensity was read in a Fluoroskan II microplate fluorometer (Labsystem, Tokyo, Japan). The results are expressed as the percentage of cells bound and represent triplicate determinations. Cell adhesion to MAdCAM-1 induced by SLC that had been immobilized on versican or GAGs was determined as follows. Various combinations of versican (300 ng/well), CS A, CS B, or HS (50 μg/ml) and MAdCAM-1-IgG (100 ng/well) or human IgG (100 ng/well) were coimmobilized in the wells overnight at 4 °C. After blocking with FCS, SLC (0–3 μg/ml) was added to the wells for 2 h at room temperature. Unbound SLC was removed by washing with PBS. Cell adhesion to each well was determined as described above. The Ca2+mobilization assay was carried out according to the method of Nagiraet al. (28Nagira M. Imai T. Hieshima K. Kusuda J. Ridanpää M. Takagi S. Nishimura M. Kakizaki M. Nomiyama H. Yoshie O. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19518-19524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). In brief, L1.2, L1.2/CCR7, and Jurkat cells were incubated at 37 °C for 1 h with 2 μmFura-2/AM (Sigma) at 1.0 × 106 cells/ml in RPMI without FCS in the dark. Cells were washed twice and resuspended at 1.0 × 106 cells/ml in PBS+ containing 1% FCS. A 1.5-ml sample of cell suspension was placed in a cuvette and set into a spectrofluorophotometer (RF1500, Shimadzu, Japan) with constant stirring. SLC (1 μg/ml), SDF-1β (1 μg/ml), or leukotriene D4 (Sigma, 0.2 μg/ml) was preincubated with versican (0.1, 0.2, or 0.4 μg/ml) or GAGs (50 μg/ml) for 10 min at room temperature and added to the cell suspension. Emission fluorescence intensity at 510 nm was measured upon excitation at 340 nm (F340) and 380 nm (F380). Data were presented as the ratio of F340 divided by F380 (R340/380). After each measurement, R340/380 in the presence or absence of excess calcium was determined by the sequential addition of 100 μl of 1% Triton X-100 with or without 100 μl of 0.5 m EDTA. The recombinant SLC was radioiodinated using Bolton-Hunter reagent (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the manufacturer's instruction. L1.2 or L1.2/CCR7 cells (5 × 105 cells) were incubated with 125I-labeled SLC (10 ng/ml) alone or in the presence of unlabeled SLC (2 μg/ml) or increasing concentrations of versican (0.001–10 μg/ml), CS A, CS B, or HS (0.5, 5, or 50 μg/ml) for 1 h. After incubation, cell suspensions were placed on a mixture of dibutyl phthalate/olive oil (4:1) and separated from unbound radiolabeled SLC by centrifugation (8,000 × g, 4 °C, 5 min). The binding of 125I-labeled SLC was counted in a γ counter. All determinations were made in triplicate. The binding of versican to 18 different chemokines was examined by dot blot analysis. Various chemokines were spotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane, biotinylated versican was added, and after washing, its binding was determined. Anti-versican core protein mAb 2B1 and anti-CS mAb CS56 were also spotted on the membrane to serve as positive controls for versican binding. As shown in Fig. 1 A, biotinylated versican bound the CXC chemokines γ interferon-inducible protein 10 (IP-10), platelet factor 4, and SDF-1β, the C chemokine lymphotactin, and the CC chemokines MCP-1, MCP-2, RANTES, liver and activation-regulated chemokine (LARC), and SLC. In contrast, biotinylated versican failed to bind interleukin-8 or MIP-1α, which are known to bind HS (29Webb L.M.C. Ehrengruber M.U. Clark-Lewis I. Baggiolini M. Rot A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 1997; 272: 10103-10109Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). We then performed a reverse assay, where the ability of immobilized versican to bind soluble chemokines was tested by ELISA. As shown in Fig. 1 B, versican bound SLC and MCP-1 in a dose-dependent manner. Similarly, immobilized versican also bound SDF-1β and lymphotactin in a dose-dependent manner (data not shown). To examine whether the chemokine binding is mediated by the GAG chains on versican, the effects of GAG-degrading enzymes on the binding of SLC to versican were examined. As shown in Fig.2, top panel, both chondroitinase ABC and chondroitinase B inhibited the binding of versican to SLC, whereas neither of these enzymes affected the reactivity of versican with anti-versican core protein mAb 2B1 (Fig. 2,middle panel). In addition, chondroitinase ABC as well as chondroitinase B almost completely abrogated the reactivity of versican with the anti-CS mAb CS56, whereas keratanase failed to alter the reactivity of versican with mAb CS56 (Fig. 2, bottom panel). These results suggest that the GAGs on versican play an important role in chemokine binding. However, the possibility remains that the core protein of versican is also involved in SLC binding, since treatment with chondroitinases did not completely inhibit the binding of SLC to versican. To further investigate the involvement of GAGs in the chemokine binding, we examined whether exogenously added soluble GAGs could inhibit the binding of chemokines to versican. Interestingly, CS B, CS E, or HS almost completely abolished the binding of most of the chemokines examined, whereas CS C and CS D inhibited the binding of a restricted set of chemokines, and chondroitin and CS A were only slightly inhibitory (Fig. 3 A). Given that CS B, CS E, and HS were extremely potent inhibitors of the chemokine binding to versican, we speculated that these GAGs might have particularly high chemokine binding abilities compared with other types of GAGs. To further examine this issue, various GAGs were immobilized on plastic wells, and the binding of SLC was determined by ELISA. As shown in Fig. 3 B, SLC bound strongly to CS B, CS E, and HS in a dose-dependent manner but bound other GAGs only weakly or not at all, consistent with the results shown in Fig. 3 A. SLC did not bind to a nonsulfated type of GAG, chondroitin. Collectively, these results indicate that the GAG chains of versican are instrumental in chemokine binding and that the sulfation of GAG chains may affect the binding. We next investigated the possible functional consequences of the versican-chemokine interaction. First, we examined whether versican could influence the SLC-induced activation of integrins using α4β7 integrin- and CCR7-expressing TK-1 mouse T cells. SLC, which we found to bind versican strongly, can facilitate the adhesion of α4β7integrin-positive cells to their ligand, MAdCAM-1 (32Pachynski R.K. Wu S.W. Gunn M.D. Erle D.J. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 952-956PubMed Google Scholar). To examine the effect of versican on this chemokine action, SLC was coimmobilized in wells with MAdCAM-1-IgG alone or with MAdCAM-1-IgG and versican. To evaluate nonspecific binding, human IgG was used instead of MAdCAM-1-IgG. As shown in Fig.4 A, left panel, SLC enhanced the binding of TK-1 cells to MAdCAM-1-IgG, showing a bell-shaped dose-response pattern in the absence of versican. This up-regulated adhesion was apparently mediated by the interaction between α4β7 integrin and MAdCAM-1, since the effect was completely abrogated by anti-β7 mAb and anti-MAdCAM-1 mAb (data not shown). By contrast, SLC immobilized on versican up-regulated the cell adhesion only marginally, if at all (Fig.4 A, right panel). The lack of strong up-regulation of TK-1 adhesion by SLC complexed with versican was not simply due to the reduced availability of SLC to TK-1, because the actual amount of SLC bound to the versican-coated wells would have been sufficient to up-regulate cell adhesion, at least when SLC was immobilized at a concentration of 1 μg/ml or higher (see Fig.4 B and its legend). We then examined whether the apparent inhibitory effect of versican was mediated by its GAG chains. For this purpose, we used GAGs instead of versican in the above-mentioned assay and compared their effects with that of versican. As shown in Fig. 4 C, the SLC·CS B complex induced the adhesion of TK-1 cells to immobilized MAdCAM-1-IgG only minimally, similar to the SLC-versican complex, whereas the SLC·HS complex strongly up-regulated the cell adhesion (Fig.4 C), in agreement with previous reports that the chemokine-HS complexes effectively activate integrins on lymphocytes (7Tanaka Y. Adams D.H. Hubscher S. Hirano H. Siebenlist U. Shaw S. Nature. 1993; 361: 79-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (843) Google Scholar, 8Tanaka Y. Kimata K. Wake A. Mine S. Morimoto I. Yamakawa N. Habuchi H. Ashikari S. Yamamoto H. Sakurai K. Yoshida K. Suzuki S. Eto S. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 1987-1997Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Little or no chemokine-induced cell adhesion was observed in CS A-coated wells, probably because of the inability of CS A to bind SLC (Fig. 3 B). In addition, inhibitory effects of versican and CS B appear specific for SLC-induced activation of integrins, since versican or CS B did not inhibit phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate-induced TK-1 adhesion (data not shown). These results demonstrate that a certain type of CS, similar or identical to CS B, negatively regulates SLC-induced cell adhesion, suggesting that versican exerts its suppressive effect on chemokine function at least partly through its GAG chains. In a separate study, we showed that versican is indeed modified at least partly with CS B (15Kawashima H. Hirose M. Hirose J. Nagakubo D. Plaas A.H.K. Miyasaka M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35448-35456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). We next evaluated another effect of versican on chemokine functions by examining the intracellular Ca2+ response elicited by SLC and SDF-1β in L1.2/CCR7 (22Yoshida R. Nagira M. Kitaura M. Imagawa N. Imai T. Yoshie O. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7118-7122Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar) and Jurkat cells (33Hesselgesser J. Liang M. Hoxie J. Greenberg M. Brass L.F. Orsini M.J. Taub D. Horuk R. J. Immuol. 1998; 160: 877-883PubMed Google Scholar), respectively. As shown in Fig. 5 A, leukotriene D4, SLC, or SDF-1β induced a rapid and transient intracellular Ca2+ response. However, versican inhibited the chemokine-induced intracellular Ca2+ response in a dose-dependent manner. Versican did not affect the leukotriene D4-induced intracellular Ca2+ response (Fig.5 A). When GAGs were used instead of versican, CS B was again inhibitory on SLC-induced intracellular Ca2+ response, whereas CS A and HS were not (Fig. 5 B). These results further suggest that versican inhibits the ability of chemokines to elicit intracellular signals, and it does so, at least in part, via its GAG chains. To investigate the mechanism by which versican inhibits chemokine functions, we examined whether versican affects the binding of SLC to CCR7-expressing cells. As shown in Fig. 6 A, the binding of 10 ng/ml 125I-SLC to L1.2/CCR7 cells was inhibited by a 200-fold excess amount of unlabeled SLC, which reduced the binding to the background level. In contrast, SLC binding was not significantly inhibited by even 10 μg/ml versican, even though the intracellular Ca2+ response induced by 1 μg/ml SLC in L1.2/CCR7 cells was inhibited by 0.4 μg/ml versican (Fig. 5). Taking the molecular size of SLC (15 kDa) and versican (1, 600 kDa) into account, this means that the intracellular Ca2+ response was inhibited at a molar ratio of 1:0.0037 (SLC:versican), whereas the binding of SLC to its receptor was uninhibited, even at a molar ratio of 1:9.37 (SLC:versican). Thus, the down-regulation of chemokine function by versican is unlikely to be due to the inhibition of SLC binding to its receptor. We next examined if GAGs affect the binding of SLC to L1.2/CCR7 cells. The binding of 10 ng/ml 125I-SLC to L1.2/CCR7 cells was inhibited by 50 μg/ml but not by lower doses of CS B or HS (5 and 0.5 μg/ml), whereas, as shown in Fig. 5, the intracellular Ca2+ response induced by 1 μg/ml SLC was inhibited by 50 μg/ml of CS B. Taking the molecular size of CS B (11–25 kDa) into consideration, this result implies that the SLC-induced intracellular Ca2+ response was inhibited by CS B at a molar ratio of 1:30.0–68.2 (SLC:CS B), whereas the binding of125I-SLC to L1.2/CCR7 cells was inhibited only at much higher molar ratios (1:3,000–6,820). It is generally accepted that proteoglycans interact with small molecular weight humoral mediators such as chemokines that are produced in the same tissue. These interactions protect the small molecules from degradation, help them form concentration gradients in situ, and help to present them to specific receptors on the cell surface (1Kjellén L.

However, it is not known whether proteoglycans always regulate chemokine function positively, let alone the exact identity of the proteoglycans involved, and it is also unclear whether this interaction is a prerequisite for chemokine function. In the present study, we showed that a large CS proteoglycan, versican, which is derived from a human renal carcinoma cell line, binds a variety of chemokines through its CS side chains. This binding was inhibited"

In present study we attempt to elucidate the mechanism by which Aβ confers its neurotoxicity. The neuroprotective effects of phytoestrogens on Aβ-mediated toxicity were also investigated. Cortical neurons treated with 5 μm Aβ-(25–35) for 40 h decreased the cell viability by 45.5 ± 4.6% concomitant with the appearance of apoptotic morphology. 50 μm kaempferol and apigenin decreased the Aβ-induced cell death by 81.5 ± 9.4% and 49.2 ± 9.9%, respectively. Aβ increased the activity of caspase 3 by 10.6-fold and to a lesser extent for caspase 2, 8, and 9. The Aβ-induced activation of caspase 3 and release of cytochromec showed a biphasic pattern. Apigenin abrogated Aβ-induced cytochrome c release, and the activation of caspase cascade. Kaempferol showed a similar effect but to a less extent. Kaempferol was also capable of eliminating Aβ-induced accumulation of reactive oxygen species. These two events accounted for the remarkable effect of kaempferol on neuroprotection. Quercetin and probucol did not affect the Aβ-mediated neurotoxicity. However, they potentiated the protective effect of apigenin. Therefore, these results demonstrate that Aβ elicited activation of caspase cascades and reactive oxygen species accumulation, thereby causing neuronal death. The blockade of caspase activation conferred the major neuroprotective effect of phytoestrogens. The antioxidative activity of phytoestrogens also modulated their neuroprotective effects on Aβ-mediated toxicity. Amyloid β protein (Aβ) elicits a toxic effect on neurons in vitro and in vivo.

Extensive studies have shown that Aβ-induced neurotoxicity in multiple cell types may be mediated by several different mechanisms. The neurotoxic effect may be attributable to the disturbance in calcium homeostasis (12Mark R.J. Hensley K. Butterfield A. Mattson M.P. J.

The increase of calcium influx leads to generating more ROS, thereby initiating the positive feedback loop. Cultured neurons treated with Aβ or transgenic mice expressing Aβ renders neurons vulnerable to apoptosis, indicating that caspase activation plays a role in Aβ-induced neurotoxicity. Several caspases involved in apoptosis have been described to be activated by Aβ (6Estus S. Tucker H.M. van Rooyen C. Wright S. Brigham E.F. Wogulis M. Rydel R.E. J.

The neuroprotective effects of estrogen are suggested to be independent of their classic nuclear estrogen receptors (32Behl C. Widmann M. Trapp T. Holsboer F. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Flavonoids, the so-called phytoestrogens, occur ubiquitously in food plants and herbal medicines. They not only bind to estrogen receptor but also exert antioxidative and antiproliferative activity (35Cao G. Sofic E. Prior R.L. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1997; 22: 749-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (2117) Google Scholar, 36Miksicek R.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1993; 44: 37-43PubMed Google Scholar, 37Miranda C.L. Stevens J.F. Helmrich A. Henderson M.C. Rodriguez R.J. Yang Y.-H. Deinzer M.L. Barnes D.W. Buhler D.R. Food Chem. Toxicol. 1999; 37: 271-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). Furthermore, evidence has demonstrated that phytoestrogens interfere with a number of intracellular processes, including enzyme activation and cAMP accumulation (38Cotelle N. Bernier J.-L. Catteau J.-P. Pommery J. Wallet J.-C. Gaydou E.M. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1996; 20: 35-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (679) Google Scholar, 39Saponara R. Bosisio E. J. Nat. Prod. 1998; 61: 1386-1387Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Flavonoids are typically classified into four groups. Those are flavone, flavonol, flavanone, and isoflavone. Thus, apigenin, luteolin, kaempferol, quercetin, naringenin, 2,3-dihydroluteolin, genistein, and prunetin were chosen for the study of neuroprotection (Fig.1). In the present report, we demonstrate that apigenin blocked the release of cytochrome c and activation of caspase cascade induced by Aβ. Kaempferol only inhibited the activation of caspase cascade, and the effect was less potent than that of apigenin. However, kaempferol was more effective than apigenin in counteract the deleterious effect of Aβ on cortical neurons. Kaempferol exhibited antioxidative activity and decreased the ROS accumulation induced by Aβ, whereas apigenin lacked antioxidative activity and showed a marginal effect on ROS level. Furthermore, quercetin or probucol facilitated the neuroprotective effect of apigenin on Aβ-mediated toxicity. Therefore, these results indicated that blockade of activation of caspase cascade conferred the neuroprotective effects of phytoestrogens on Aβ-mediated neurotoxicity. The inhibition of caspase cascade in combination with antioxidative activity will further eliminate Aβ-mediated neurotoxicity. Media and supplements for cell culture were from Life Technologies (Gaithersburg, MD).

Colorimetric caspase substrates were fromBIOSOURCE (Nivelles, Belgium). Monoclonal antibodies for cytochrome c were obtained from PharMingen (San Diago, CA). All other reagents were purchased from Sigma or Merck (Darmstadt, Germany). Primary cultures of neonatal cortical neurons were prepared from the cerebral cortex of Harlan Sprague-Dawley rat pups at postnatal day 1 (40Brewer G.J. J. Neurosci.

Briefly, each pup was decapitated and the cortex was digested in 0.5 mg/ml papain at 37 °C for 15 min. The tissue was dissociated in Hypernate A medium (containing B27 supplement) by aspirating trituration. Cells were plated (5 × 104 cells/cm2) onto poly-d-lysine-coated dishes and maintained in Neurobasal medium containing B27 supplement (40Brewer G.J. J. Neurosci. Methods. 1997; 71: 143-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar), 10 units/ml penicillin, 10 μg/ml streptomycin, and 0.5 μg/ml glutamine (5% CO2/9% O2) for 3 days. Cells were then exposed to cytosine-β-d-arabinofuranoside (5 μm) for 1 day to inhibit proliferation of non-neuronal cells. The cells were used for the experiment on the fifth day. The reduction of MTT, cleavage of FDA, and trypan blue exclusion were used to evaluate the cell viability. Cells were incubated with minimum essential medium containing 0.5 mg/ml MTT for 1 h. The medium was aspirated, and the formazan particle was dissolved with lysis buffer (10% sodium dodecyl sulfate, 3.3 mm HCl, 50% dimethylformamide).A 600 nm was measured by using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay reader (42Wood A.G. Cribbs D.H. Whittemore E.R. Cotman C.W. Brain Res. 1995; 697: 53-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Cells were loaded with 15 μm FDA for 5 min at 25 °C, and then 1 ml of 1% deoxycholate was added to lyse the cells. The fluorescent intensity of the lysate was determined by using a spectrofluorometer with excitation and emission wavelength of 490 nm and 514 nm, respectively (26Ueda K. Shinohara S. Yagami T. Asakura K. Kawasaki K. J. Neurochem. 1997; 68: 265-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar, 43Ha H.C. Woster P.M. Yager J.D. Casero R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11557-11562Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). Cell viability was also assessed by using trypan blue exclusion as described previously (42Wood A.G. Cribbs D.H. Whittemore E.R. Cotman C.W. Brain Res. 1995; 697: 53-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Intracellular reactive oxygen species were measured by CM-H2DCFDA assay (26Ueda K. Shinohara S. Yagami T. Asakura K. Kawasaki K. J. Neurochem. 1997; 68: 265-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). In brief, cells were loaded with 50 μm CM-H2DCFDA for 30 min, and then 1 ml of 1% deoxycholate was added to lyse the cells. The fluorescent intensity of the lysate was determined by using a spectrofluorometer with excitation and emission wavelength of 488 nm and 525 nm, respectively. Treated cells were collected in harvest buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin) and suspended by passage through a 200-μl pipette tip. The cell suspensions were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min, and supernatants were diluted with the same volume of immunoprecipitation buffer (harvest buffer containing 2% Nonidet P-40). Immunoprecipitation of cytochrome c was performed by using anti-cytochrome c antibody. The immunoprecipitates were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Immunoreactive proteins were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence detection reagents. Treated cells were harvested in cell lysis buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1% Chaps, and 0.1% Triton X-100). The detailed experiments were performed according to the manufacturer's protocol. The antioxidant activity of phytoestrogens were determined by trolox equilibrium antioxidant capacity (TEAC) method as described by Pellegrini et al. (44Pellegrini N. Re R. Yang M. Rich-Evans C. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 299: 379-389Crossref Scopus (571) Google Scholar). The activity of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) was determined by a method described previously (45Roth A. Schaffner W. Hertel C. J. Neurosci. Res. 1999; 57: 399-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Results are expressed as means ± S.D. and were analyzed by ANOVA with post hoc multiple comparison with a Bonferroni test. Treatment of rat cortical neurons with the toxic fragment of fibril Aβ (f-Aβ-(25–35)) for 40 h decreased cell viability in a concentration-dependent manner as determined by MTT reduction or trypan blue exclusion (Fig.2 A). 10 μm Aβ decreased the MTT reduction and trypan blue exclusion by 58.2 ± 3.9% and 63.3 ± 11.5%, respectively. However, treatment with Aβ elicited a marginal effect on the ability to cleave fluorescein diacetate and had no effect on the release of LDH. The effect of Aβ on cell viability of cortical neurons was time-dependent as measured by MTT reduction (Fig. 2 B). The appearance of irregularly shaped cell bodies and discontinuous neurite was concomitant with the decrease of cell viability (Fig. 2 C). The percentage of cells with injured morphology was elevated as the concentration of Aβ was increased. The effects of a series of phytoestrogens on Aβ-induced neurotoxicity were investigated. Cells were incubated with various concentrations of pytoestrogens for 2 h then exposed to 5 μm Aβ for 40 h. Cell viability was verified by MTT reduction analysis. Results showed that kaempferol and apigenin reduced the Aβ-induced neurotoxicity in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig.3, A and B). Kaempferol at 50 μm decreased the percentage of cell death from 45.5 ± 4.6% to 7.9 ± 3.6%. Apigenin was less potent to attenuate Aβ-induced neurotoxicity (Fig. 3 B). For the morphology, 50 μm kaempferol diminished the extent of cells with injured morphology induced by Aβ (Fig.3 C). The protective effect of kaempferol on Aβ-mediated neurotoxicity was further confirmed by the measurement of trypan blue exclusion (data not shown). Luteolin, quercetin, flavanones, isoflavones, and β-estradiol did not show any significant effects on Aβ-induced neurotoxicity (Table I).Table IProtection of cortical neurons against Aβ-induced cell death by phytoestrogens and estrogenCell death%5 μm Aβ (0.1% Me2SO)45.5 ± 4.65 μm Aβ plus Reagent (μm)Flavones Apigenin (50)25.0 ± 5.01-ap < 0.001.

Significant differences between cells treated with Aβ and Aβ plus phytoestrogen or estrogen are indicated in footnotes. Inhibitors of caspases were employed to investigate whether apoptosis was involved in Aβ-mediated toxicity. Ac-DEVD-CHO and Ac-LEHD-CHO are the cell-permeable inhibitors for caspases 3 and 9, respectively. These inhibitors block the activity of caspases but do not interfere with its activation. Both inhibitors reduced Aβ-induced cell death in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig.4, A and B). In contrary, Ac-IETD-CHO, the cell-permeable inhibitor of caspase 8, did not decrease Aβ-induced cell death (data not shown). Morphological study also showed that Ac-DEVD-CHO and Ac-LEHD-CHO eliminated the cells with injured morphology induced by Aβ (Fig. 4 C). Analysis of the activity of caspases were performed to further determine whether the activation of caspase cascade was involved in the Aβ-mediated neurotoxicity. Treatment of neurons with Aβ induced activation of caspase 2, 3, 8, and 9 in a time-dependent manner as measured by substrate cleavage (Fig.5). Exposure of neurons to Aβ for 24 h, the specific activity of caspase 2, 3, 8, and 9 were increased by 6.4-, 11.6-, 6.0-, and 4.7-fold of control, respectively. The activity of caspase 3 was enhanced to a larger extent by Aβ in comparison with caspase 2, 8, and 9. Aβ exhibited a biphasic effect on the activation of caspase 3. There was a transit activation of caspase 3 at 2 h and followed by a sustained activation from 8 to 24 h. The similar result for caspase 9 was also obtained. However, the first wave of activation of caspase 9 at 2 h was not statistically significant. Caspases 2 and 8 did not show early phase of activation. The significant activation of caspases 2 and 8 occurred from 12 to 24 h. The inhibitor of caspases 3, 9, and 8 decreased the activity of caspase 3 and 9 at 2 h (TableII). Both inhibitors of caspase 3 and 9 inhibited the activity of caspase 2, 3, and 9 at 24 h (TableIII). The inhibitor of caspase 3 diminished the activity of caspase 2, 3, and 9 by 72.8 ± 8.7, 90.8 ± 4.4, and 60.9 ± 15.0%, respectively, and the inhibitor of caspase 9 decreased the activity of caspases to a lesser extent. However, both inhibitors did not show significant effect on the activity of caspase 8. The inhibitor of caspase 8 decreased the activity of caspase 8 and 9 by 17.0 and ± 4.0% and 43.4 ± 4.0%, respectively.Table IIThe inhibition of caspase activation at 2 h by phytoestrogens and caspase inhibitorsReagentsCaspase activityCaspase 3Caspase 9%Apigenin100.6 ± 16.8100.3 ± 28.6Kaempferol112.5 ± 15.284.3 ± 34.9Quercetin113.3 ± 10.32-bp < 0.001.87.2 ± 19.3Ac-DEVD-CHO (caspase 3 inhibitor)2.9 ± 3.72-bp < 0.001.25.9 ± 6.92-bp < 0.001.Ac-LEDH-CHO (caspase 9 inhibitor)76.7 ± 8.42-bp < 0.001.82.7 ± 17.22-ap < 0.01.Ac-IETD-CHO (caspase 8 inhibitor)60.8 ± 8.02-bp < 0.001.31.7 ± 12.72-bp < 0.001.Cortical neurons were incubated with phytoestrogens (50 μm) or caspase inhibitor (10 μm) for 2 h and exposed to 5 μm Aβ for 2 h.

Apigenin and kaempferol did not show significant effects on the activation of caspase cascade at 2 h (Table II). However, apigenin inhibited the activity of caspase 2, 3, 8, and 9 at 24 h by about 55 to 60% (Table III). Kaempferol also diminished the activity of these caspases but to a lesser extent. Quercetin only showed inhibitory effect on the activity of caspase 9 at 24 h (Table III). Kaempferol and apigenin attenuated Aβ-induced activation of caspases 9 and 3. The release of cytochrome c from mitochondria, the upstream signaling component of these two caspases, was therefore investigated (Fig. 6). The release of cytochrome c induced by Aβ exerted a biphasic pattern similar to the ac"

However, the mechanisms whereby factors such as basic fibroblast growth factor promote the formation of new blood vessels are not known. In the present study, we demonstrate that exogenously added plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) at therapeutic concentrations is a potent inhibitor of basic fibroblast growth factor-induced angiogenesis in the chicken chorioallantoic membrane. By using specific PAI-1 mutants with either their vitronectin binding or proteinase inhibitor activities ablated, we show that the inhibition of angiogenesis appears to occur via two distinct but apparently overlapping pathways. The first is dependent on PAI-1 inhibition of proteinase activity, most likely chicken plasmin, while the second is independent of PAI-1's anti-proteinase activity and instead appears to act through PAI-1 binding to vitronectin. Together, these data suggest that PAI-1 may be an important factor regulating angiogenesis in vivo. The process of angiogenesis is important in both normal and pathologic physiology.

In healthy individuals, PAI-1 expression is low and generally confined to vascular smooth muscle cells and megakaryocytes. However, its expression in many other cells, including endothelial cells, can be induced by a number of stimuli such as cytokines and growth factors (3Loskutoff D.J. Samad F. Arterioscler. Thromb.

However, recent studies suggest that the role of uPA as well as other proteinases may not be to cause generalized matrix destruction but instead may be to expose cryptic cell attachment sites necessary for cell migration (10Stefansson S.

Vitronectin is a multifunctional glycoprotein present in plasma, platelets, and the extravascular matrix. Like PAI-1, vitronectin is deposited at sites of disease or injury (15Robbie L.A. Booth N.A.

However, upon binding to a surface at a site of injury, vitronectin undergoes a conformational change, which exposes the integrin binding site (22Seiffert D. Smith J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13705-13710Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Similarly, active PAI-1 converts the closed plasma form of vitronectin to the open integrin binding conformation (22Seiffert D. Smith J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13705-13710Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Paradoxically, however, PAI-1 binding to vitronectin blocks the adjacent RGD integrin binding site on vitronectin (10Stefansson S. Lawrence D.A. Nature. 1996; 383: 441-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar, 11Kjoller L. Kanse S.M. Kirkegaard T. Rodenburg K.W. Ronne E. Goodman S.L. Preissner K.T. Ossowski L. Andreasen P.A. Exp.

Thus, the association of PAI-1 with vitronectin simultaneously induces the cell binding conformation but blocks the cell binding site. However, this block is likely to be transient, since reaction of PAI-1 with a proteinase induces a rapid conformational change in PAI-1 that causes a large reduction in its affinity for vitronectin. Likewise, complex formation between PAI-1 and a proteinase induces an equally dramatic increase in PAI-1 affinity for some members of the low density lipoprotein receptor family, such as the low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein, gp330/megalin, and the very low density lipoprotein receptor (23Stefansson S.

This leads to rapid repartitioning of PAI-1 from vitronectin in the matrix to the endocytic receptors and subsequent cellular degradation of the PAI-1-proteinase complex (23Stefansson S. Muhammad S. Cheng X.F. Battey F.D. Strickland D.K. Lawrence D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6358-6366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Thus, PAI-1 and vitronectin can be thought of as forming a molecular switch (10Stefansson S. Lawrence D.A. Nature. 1996; 383: 441-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar, 19Deng G.

Med. 1998; 8: 175-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). When PAI-1 is bound to vitronectin, the integrin adhesion site is cryptic, and cell migration is blocked. However, association with a proteinase induces the conformational change associated with the switch in PAI-1 affinity from vitronectin to low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein, resulting in clearance of the PAI-1 and allowing cellular integrins access to the RGD adhesion site. Thus, PAI-1 bound to vitronectin within the extracellular matrix may serve to regulate cell migration, both by regulating specific proteolysis and by controlling access of cellular integrins to specific adhesion sites within the matrix. Accordingly, the present study examines the potential of exogenously added PAI-1 to regulate vascular cell migration in vivo by testing the hypothesis that PAI-1 can inhibit angiogenesis in vivo in both a vitronectin-dependent and a proteinase-dependent manner. To maintain PAI-1 functional activity during the extended incubations required for these in vivoassays, all recombinant PAI-1 proteins, unless otherwise noted, were constructed on the constitutively active PAI-1 background (14-1b) (27Berkenpas M.B. Lawrence D.A. Ginsburg D. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2969-2977Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This form of PAI-1 has been shown to be essentially identical to wild-type PAI-1 with respect to inhibitory activity, as well as binding to vitronectin, heparin, and low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein but has a half-life nearly 75-fold longer than wild-type PAI-1 at 37 °C (145 versus 2 h) (23Stefansson S.

Ginsburg D. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2969-2977Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The 14-1b PAI-1 and latent wild type PAI-1 were from Molecular Innovations. All other forms were constructed using the Transformer site-directed mutagenesis kit (CLONTECH) according to the manufacturer's instructions and isolated as described (28Kvassman J.-O. Shore J.D. Fibrinolysis. 1995; 9: 215-221Crossref Scopus (51) Google Scholar), except that preparations having significant detectable endotoxin levels following phenyl-Sepharose chromatography were further purified by polymyxin B chromatography (Detoxi-Gel; Pierce). Final endotoxin levels for all proteins used were below the FDA limit for parenteral drugs of 5 endotoxin units/kg (29Food and Drug Administration, Inspector's Technical Guide , number 40, 1985, United States Food and Drug Administration, Washington, D. C..Google Scholar). The different forms of PAI-1 used were as follows: 14-1b PAI-1 (PAI-1); latent PAI-1 (PAI-1L); PAI-1 with mutation of Gln123 to Lys (PAI-1K), which has been previously shown to have a specific defect in vitronectin binding but retains full inhibitory activity (30Lawrence D.A. Berkenpas M.B. Palaniappan S. Ginsburg D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15223-15228Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); PAI-1 with mutation of Arg346 to Ala (PAI-1A), which binds vitronectin with wild-type affinity but does not inhibit PAs (10Stefansson S. Lawrence D.A. Nature. 1996; 383: 441-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar); and finally, a double mutant, Thr333 to Arg, Ala335 to Arg (PAI-1R), which binds vitronectin normally but has no inhibitory activity toward any proteinase. Cleaved forms of PAI-1 were made by incubating PAI-1 with pancreatic elastase at a molar ratio of 100:1 (PAI-1/elastase) for 30 min followed by inactivation of the elastase with phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (1 mm) (31Lawrence D.A. Olson S.T. Palaniappan S. Ginsburg D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27657-27662Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This results in cleavage of the reactive center loop at a single site and induces the conformational change in PAI-1 associated with reactive center loop insertion and loss of vitronectin affinity (13Lawrence D.A.

The data are calculated as angiogenic index, which is determined by subtracting the mean branching observed in the absence of FGF-2 treatment from the branch points in samples treated with FGF-2 and presented as the percentage of the FGF-2 only-treated control. SDS-PAGE zymography was used for analysis of proteinase levels in CAM tissue. Briefly, tissues were harvested after 72 h of treatment, rapidly frozen on dry ice, and stored at −70 °C. Immediately prior to analysis, frozen tissues were weighed and then extracted in nonreducing SDS-PAGE sample buffer, after which equivalent amounts of tissue extract were subjected to SDS-PAGE on a 10% gel (Novex). Chicken kidney extracts containing uPA were prepared as described (34Hastings G.A. Coleman T.A. Haudenschild C.C. Stefansson S. Smith E.P. Barthlow R. Cherry S. Sandkvist M. Lawrence D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 33062-33067Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar) and were included as positive controls. Following electrophoresis, gels were soaked in 2.5% Triton X-100 twice for 45 min each to remove the SDS. The gel was then applied to a 1% agarose gel containing 1% casein with or without 30 μg/ml of chicken plasminogen (Molecular Innovations) and incubated in a humid chamber at 37 °C. Samples were also analyzed on casein indicator gels containing 100 μg/ml of anti-human uPA (Chemicon). The second order rate constant for the inhibition of chicken plasmin (Molecular Innovations) by the constitutively active human PAI-1 was determined as described (34Hastings G.A. Coleman T.A. Haudenschild C.C. Stefansson S. Smith E.P. Barthlow R. Cherry S. Sandkvist M. Lawrence D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 33062-33067Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). The relative inhibitory activity of the PAI-1K mutant versus chicken plasmin was compared with active PAI-1 by titration as described (35Lawrence D.A. Strandberg L. Ericson J. Ny T. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 20293-20301Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), except that the substrate Val-Leu-Lys-p-nitroanilide (Sigma) was used. The relative inhibition of chicken uPA by the various forms of PAI-1 was examined by incubation of PAI-1 with kidney extracts followed by SDS-PAGE zymography, and none of the forms of PAI-1 tested effectively blocked chicken uPA (data not shown). Immunoblot analysis of purified chicken plasminogen, plasmin, and CAM extracts was performed essentially as described (34Hastings G.A. Coleman T.A. Haudenschild C.C. Stefansson S. Smith E.P. Barthlow R. Cherry S. Sandkvist M. Lawrence D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 33062-33067Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). PAI-1 and plasmin complexes were formed by reacting equimolar amounts of PAI-1 and plasmin for 30 min at room temperature prior to the addition of SDS-PAGE sample buffer. To determine whether PAI-1 was inhibiting plasmin within the CAM tissue an ELISA specific for PAI-1-plasmin complexes was developed. Briefly, a monoclonal antibody, MA33B8 (36Debrock S. Declerck P.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1337: 257-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) (Molecular Innovations), was coated onto microtiter plates at 2 μg/ml in TBS for 1 h at 37 °C. This antibody has previously been shown to bind reactive center loop inserted forms of PAI-1, such as PAI-1 in complex with a proteinase, with high affinity (37Verhamme I. Kvassman J.O. Day D. Debrock S. Vleugels N. Declerck P.J. Shore J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17511-17517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Following coating, the plates were blocked for 1 h using 2% bovine serum albumin, 5% nonfat dried milk in TBS (blocking buffer), after which samples of CAM tissue extracts in blocking buffer were added to the plate and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h followed by washing with TBS, 0.01% Tween 20. The plate was then incubated with a 1:10,000 dilution of rabbit anti-chicken plasminogen antiserum in blocking buffer for 1 h at 37 °C, followed by washing with TBS, 0.01% Tween 20. Next, goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to alkaline phosphatase was added at a 1:5000 dilution in blocking buffer and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C, followed by washing. The plasmin-PAI-1 complexes were then detected using the substrate p-nitrophenyl phosphate, disodium (Sigma) at a concentration of 4 mg/ml in TBS. The values obtained for the plasmin-PAI-1 complexes present in the CAM tissues were compared with a standard curve of purified chicken plasmin-PAI-1 complexes. To ensure the specificity of the ELISA, preliminary experiments were also performed. These demonstrated that the constitutively active form of PAI-1 (14-1b) used in our studies did not bind to MA33B8 coated onto microtiter plates prior to complex formation with chicken plasmin when detected with rabbit anti-human PAI-1 antiserum (data not shown). Likewise, the ELISA was shown to be specific for PAI-1-plasmin complexes when the rabbit anti-chicken plasminogen antiserum was used, since purified PAI-1·uPA complexes were not detected in this assay (data not shown). For immunofluorescence analysis of frozen samples, CAM tissues were embedded in OCT and snap-frozen in a 2-methylbutane dry ice slurry, and stored at −80 °C until processing. Sections were cut at 5 μm and fixed for 10 min in methanol/acetone 1:1 and then rinsed in phosphate-buffered saline. Samples were then stained with rabbit anti-chicken vitronectin antibodies and analyzed by immunofluorescence using a rhodamine-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG (Pierce) for detection. Previously, we demonstrated that vitronectin enhanced the migration of smooth muscle cells in vitro and that PAI-1 was an efficient inhibitor of this enhancement (10Stefansson S. Lawrence D.A. Nature. 1996; 383: 441-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar). This inhibition was independent of PAI-1's anti-proteinase activity and instead was dependent on PAI-1 binding to matrix vitronectin, where it prevented the association of promigratory integrins with vitronectin (10Stefansson S. Lawrence D.A. Nature. 1996; 383: 441-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar, 11Kjoller L. Kanse S.M. Kirkegaard T. Rodenburg K.W. Ronne E. Goodman S.L. Preissner K.T. Ossowski L. Andreasen P.A. Exp. Cell Res. 1997; 232: 420-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Similarly, vitronectin can also stimulate the migration of endothelial cells in vitro, and as with smooth muscle cells this stimulation is blocked by PAI-1. 2G. A. McMahon and D. Lawrence, unpublished data. Together, these data suggest that vitronectin stimulates vascular cell migration and that PAI-1 blocks this enhancement by preventing the association of αvβ3 or other promigratory integrins with vitronectin in the matrix. Since PAI-1 and vitronectin appear to act together in vitroto regulate vascular cell migration, we tested the ability of PAI-1 to inhibit angiogenesis in vivo. For these studies, we examined the effect of PAI-1 on FGF-2-induced angiogenesis in the chicken CAM assay. Fig. 1 shows the results obtained following treatment for 3 days with or without FGF-2 or FGF-2 plus PAI-1. A and B show CAM tissue incubated with either vehicle alone or with FGF-2, respectively. As expected, FGF-2 induced a strong angiogenic response in the CAM tissue, as is evident from the increased number of branching vessels. C andD show the effect of 1 μm latent-PAI-1 (PAI-1L; C) or active-PAI-1 (D) on FGF-2-induced angiogenesis. These data indicate that only the active form of PAI-1 is an effective inhibitor of FGF-2-mediated angiogenesis in the CAM assay. Quantitation of these results demonstrated that active PAI-1 completely blocks angiogenesis, whereas PAI-1Lhas no significant effect (Fig.2 A). Moreover, the inhibition of angiogenesis by active-PAI-1 is dose-dependent with an IC50 value of 0.112 ± 0.005 μm (Fig.2 B). Remarkably, this value is nearly identical to the reported K d of 0.100–0.125 μm for PAI-1 binding to native vitronectin in solution (13Lawrence D.A. Palaniappan S. Stefansson S. Olson S.T.

Shore J.D. Peterson C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5112-5121Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), suggesting that similar to vascular cell migration in vitro, PAI-1 inhibition of CAM angiogenesis might be at least in part vitronectin dependent. However, since the active conformation of PAI-1 both binds vitronectin with high affinity and inhibits proteinases, whereas PAI-1L has neither property (13Lawrence D.A. Palaniappan S. Stefansson S.

Chem. 1997; 272: 7676-7680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), these results do not reveal whether the inhibition of angiogenesis is dependent on either proteinase inhibition, vitronectin binding, or both.Figure 2Quantitation of angiogenesis in the CAM assay with active and latent PAI-1. A, the angiogenic index of CAM tissue treated with FGF-2 in the presence or absence of latent or active PAI-1. None, CAMs treated with FGF-2 only;p values of <0.05 relative to the FGF-2 only control are shown. B, the inhibition of angiogenesis by increasing concentrations of active PAI-1. The curve for active PAI-1 was generated with a four-parameter fit as described (65Ukraincik K. Piknosh W. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 74: 497-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). In bothA and B, the data are presented as the percentage of the FGF-2 only control (100%), and n ≥ 6 for each condition.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To dissect the contribution of PAI-1 proteinase-inhibitory activity away from its vitronectin binding properties, on the inhibition of angiogenesis, a specific PAI-1 mutant was constructed that binds vitronectin poorly but retains wild-type inhibitory activity (30Lawrence D.A. Berkenpas M.B. Palaniappan S. Ginsburg D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15223-15228Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This mutant, PAI-1K, has a greater than 250-fold lower affinity for vitronectin than does wild-type PAI-1 and should inhibit proteinase activity in the CAM tissue without significantly blocking vascular cell adhesion to vitronectin (13Lawrence D.A. Palaniappan S. Stefansson S. Olson S.T. Francis-Chmura A.M. Shore J.D. Ginsburg D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7676-7680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Fig. 3 demonstrates that this mutant, like fully functional PAI-1, significantly inhibits vessel formation in the CAM in a dose-dependent manner with an IC50 of 0.204 ± 0.017 μm. This value is ∼2-fold higher than that of fully functional PAI-1, which is 0.112 μm. This suggests that PAI-1's anti-proteinase activity is critical for its inhibition of angiogenesis and that its binding to vitronectin is likely to be less important for this inhibition. However, it is also possible that these two activities overlap, such that high levels of anti-proteinase activity may mask the importance of vitronectin binding. This would be the case, for example, if proteolytic remodeling of the matrix were required to expose cryptic vitronectin adhesion sites, which then were able to promote vascular cell migration. To directly examine proteinase activity during FGF-2-induced angiogenesis, CAM extracts were analyzed by SDS-PAGE zymography. These results demonstrate that there is a marked increase in uPA activity in CAM tissue following 72 h of treatment with FGF-2 (Fig.4 A, lane 4), and PAI-1 does not appear to significantly reduce this activity (Fig. 4 A, lane 5). The lack of inhibition of chicken uPA by active human PAI-1 is consistent with previous findings (39Sipley J.D. Alexander D.S. Testa J.E. Quigley J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2933-2938Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) and suggests that human PAI-1's anti-proteinase activity in this system is probably directed toward another enzyme. Since the most obvious function of uPA is to activate plasminogen to plasmin, and since PAI-1 has been reported to be a very efficient inhibitor of plasmin (40Hekman C.M. Loskutoff D.J. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 2911-2918Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), we examined the ability of human PAI-1 to directly inhibit chicken plasmin. These data indicated that human PAI-1 is a very efficient inhibitor of chicken plasmin, having a second-order rate constant of ∼7.6 × 105m−1 s−1(data not shown). This is essentially identical to the rate of 6.6 × 105m−1s−1 reported for bovine PAI-1 inhibition of human plasmin (40Hekman C.M. Loskutoff D.J. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 2911-2918Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Human PAI-1 also formed SDS-stable high molecular weight complexes with chicken plasmin as expected for inhibition of a serine proteinase by a serpin (Fig. 4 B, lane 4) (41Lawrence D.A. Ginsburg D.

A “dimorphic” fungus, H. capsulatum exists as a saprophytic mold in soil and converts to the parasitic yeast form after inhalation. Only the yeasts secrete a calcium-binding protein (CBP) and can grow in calcium-limiting conditions. To probe the relation between calcium limitation and intracellular parasitism, we designed a strategy to disrupt CBP1 in H. capsulatum using a telomeric linear plasmid and a two-step genetic selection.

The identical effect was achieved after stimulation with a VGVAPG synthetic peptide, reflecting the elastin-derived domain known to bind to the 67-kDa elastin-binding protein. This clearly indicated involvement of this receptor in the described phenomenon. This notion was further reinforced by the fact that elastin peptides-dependent MMP-1 up-regulation has not been demonstrated in cultures preincubated with 1 mm lactose, which causes shedding of the elastin-binding protein and with pertussis toxin, which blocks the elastin-binding protein-dependent signaling pathway involving G protein, phospholipase C, and protein kinase C. Moreover, we demonstrated that diverse peptides maintaining GXX PG sequences can also induce similar cellular effects as a “principal” VGVAPG ligand of the elastin receptor. Results of our biophysical studies suggest that this peculiar consensus sequence stabilizes a type VIII β-turn in several similar, but not identical, peptides that maintain a sufficient conformation to be recognized by the elastin receptor. We have also established that GXX PG elastin-derived peptides, in addition to pro-MMP-1, cause up-regulation of pro-matrix metalloproteinase-3 (pro-stromelysin 1). Furthermore, we found that the presence of plasmin in the culture medium activated these MMP proenzymes, leading to a consequent degradation of collagen substrate. Our results may be, therefore, relevant to pathobiology of inflammation, in which elastin-derived peptides bearing the GXX PG conformation (created after leukocyte-dependent proteolysis) bind to the elastin receptor of local fibroblasts and trigger signals leading to expression and activation of MMP-1 and MMP-3, which in turn exacerbate local connective tissue damage.

Due to its numerous cross-links and the extreme hydrophobicity of its tropoelastin chains, elastin is highly resistant to proteolysis. However, during inflammatory disorders, proteinases secreted from polymorphonuclear neutrophils, such as elastase, cathepsin G, and gelatinase B may cause significant elastolysis (4Boudier C.

Damsky C.H. Werb Z. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 1707-1720Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Their expression is regulated through interaction between cells and extracellular matrix via several classes of cell surface receptors (25Tremble P. Damsky C.H. Werb Z. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 1707-1720Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). For example, a single module within fibronectin can elicit a particular cell response, resulting in either up- or down-regulation of collagenase (MMP-1) production (26Huhtala P. Humphries M.J. McCarthy J.B. Tremble P.M. Werb Z. Damsky C.H. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 867-879Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). Attracted by the wide range of cellular effects induced by elastin-derived peptides, we investigated whether peptides resulting from elastin degradation would also control MMPs (MMP-1,i.e. collagenase-1; MMP-3, i.e. stromelysin-1) expression and secretion and thereby contribute to further degradation of other matrix components.Results of the present study indicate that cultured human skin fibroblasts up-regulate expression and secretion of pro-MMP-1 and pro-MMP-3 after stimulation with products of organo-alkaline- and human leukocyte elastase (HLE)-dependent elastin degradation. Our data suggest that among many elastin-derived peptides, only those with the GXX PG consensus sequence possess a conformation that allows binding to the EBP and a consequent triggering of signals responsible for the up-regulation pro-MMP-1 and pro-MMP-3. Finally, we have established that both secreted pro-enzymes can be activated after the addition of exogenous plasmin to the culture medium and then degrade a collagen substrate. Our results thus raise the possibility that elastin degradation could lead to collagenolysis during normal and/or pathological conditions.DISCUSSIONIt has been shown previously that interaction of elastin-derived peptides with the cell surface EBP leads to modulation of diverse gene expression and multiple cellular effects (17Jacob M.P. Fülöp Jr., T. Foris G. Robert L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 995-999Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 20Faury G. Garnier S. Weiss A.S. Wallach J. Fülöp Jr., T. Jacob M.P. Mecham R.P. Robert L. Verdetti J. Circ. Res. 1998; 82: 328-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Our data demonstrate that tropoelastin and elastin degradation products are potent inducers of collagenolytic enzyme expression in human skin fibroblasts. Interestingly, such an effect was attained even at elastin-derived peptide concentrations close to those determined in physiological fluids (41Fülöp Jr., T. Wei S.M. Robert L. Jacob M.P. Clin. Physiol. Biochem. 1990; 8: 273-282PubMed Google Scholar) and potentiated at higher concentrations, often detected during inflammatory processes (33Hornebeck W. Gogly B. Godeau G. Emonard H. Pellat B. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1999; 878: 625-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). The fact that this effect could be largely inhibited in the presence of lactose and reproduced by stimulation with VGVAPG and other peptides bearing the GXX PG consensus sequence suggests involvement of the EBP in signaling triggering pro-MMP-1 and pro-MMP-3 up-regulation.Among elastin-derived peptides, only those containing the GXX PG conformation have been identified as the ligands of the cell surface EBP and stimulators of numerous cellular effects (9Grosso L.E. Scott M. Matrix. 1993; 13: 157-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Our present results broaden the range of the biological activity of those peculiar peptides and provides a molecular explanation of their binding to the cell surface receptor.The assembly of tropoelastin into mature elastic fibers is also directed by the EBP (42Hinek A. Biol. Chem. 1996; 377: 471-480PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, it could be assumed that neither tropoelastin bound to this chaperone protein during its secretion from cells nor insoluble elastin surrounded in tissues by a mantle of microfibrils (43Sakai L.Y. Keene D.R. Engvall E. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 2499-2509Crossref PubMed Scopus (894) Google Scholar) could interact directly with cells under physiological conditions.The VGVAPG cell recognition domains are accessible on the surface of growing elastic fibers as shown using specific monoclonal antibodies (44Wrenn D.S. Griffin G.L. Senior R.M. Mecham R.P. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 5172-5176Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). In mature fibers, however, these hydrophobic sequences remain probably masked and simply contribute to the global elasticity of the polymer. However, after tissue injury and release of potent elastolytic enzymes by leukocytes, these domains could be unmasked and/or cleaved of the elastin polymer so that they could bind to the EBP of the adjacent cells.In fact, we demonstrated that peptides capable of interaction with the EBP can be released from the elastin network by HLE. We therefore suggest that these peptides bound to the EBP and triggered a pathway of intracellular signals leading to the described up-regulation of pro-MMP-1 and pro-MMP-3 production.Matrix proteins like elastin, laminins, collagens, fibrillins, or fibronectin contain several GXX PG consensus sequences. As seen here, the stimulation of MMP-1 expression could also be achieved using the laminin-derived LGTIPG peptide. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that small peptides bearing GXX PG sequences, released from other matrix proteins could also interact with the cell surface EBP. We therefore propose that peptides bearing GXX PG conformation, regardless their origin, could serve as stimulators of pro-MMP-1 production once released. This seems to be particularly relevant to inflammatory processes in which HLE and other proteinases released by infiltrating leukocytes could degrade elastin and other matrix proteins, leading to accumulation of peptides, which in turn could interact with EBP and lead to the local accumulation of pro-MMP-1 and its activator pro-MMP-3. Since these pro-enzymes could be activated to active proteinases by plasmin (40Benbow U. Schoenermark M.P. Mitchell T.I. Rutter J.L. Shimokawa K. Nagase H. Brinckerhoff C.E. J. Biol.

In summary, we suggest that initial elastolysis could lead to a consequent degradation of collagen and other matrix components. This phenomenon could play an important part in the mechanisms controlling connective tissue remodeling during normal and/or pathological processes. The extracellular matrix protein elastin is responsible for the elastic properties of tissues such as lung, skin, and large arteries (1Vrhovski B. Weiss T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 258: 1-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar, 2Debelle L. Alix A.J.P. Biochimie (Paris). 1999; 81: 981-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 3Debelle L. Tamburro A.M. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1999; 31: 261-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). Due to its numerous cross-links and the extreme hydrophobicity of its tropoelastin chains, elastin is highly resistant to proteolysis. However, during inflammatory disorders, proteinases secreted from polymorphonuclear neutrophils, such as elastase, cathepsin G, and gelatinase B may cause significant elastolysis (4Boudier C. Godeau G. Hornebeck W. Robert L. Bieth J.G. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1991; 4: 497-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). It has been established that peptides derived from elastin or from the hydrophobic domains of tropoelastin interact with cells via a cell surface-resided 67-kDa elastin-binding protein identical to an enzymatically inactive, alternatively spliced form of β-galactosidase (5Hinek A. Rabinovitch M. Keeley F. Okamura-Oho Y. Callahan J. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 91: 1198-1205Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar).

Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are potent proteinases involved in a broad range of normal and pathological processes (25Tremble P. Damsky C.H. Werb Z. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 1707-1720Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Their expression is regulated through interaction between cells and extracellular matrix via several classes of cell surface receptors (25Tremble P. Damsky C.H. Werb Z. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 1707-1720Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). For example, a single module within fibronectin can elicit a particular cell response, resulting in either up- or down-regulation of collagenase (MMP-1) production (26Huhtala P. Humphries M.J. McCarthy J.B. Tremble P.M. Werb Z. Damsky C.H. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 867-879Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). Attracted by the wide range of cellular effects induced by elastin-derived peptides, we investigated whether peptides resulting from elastin degradation would also control MMPs (MMP-1,i.e. collagenase-1; MMP-3, i.e. stromelysin-1) expression and secretion and thereby contribute to further degradation of other matrix components. Results of the present study indicate that cultured human skin fibroblasts up-regulate expression and secretion of pro-MMP-1 and pro-MMP-3 after stimulation with products of organo-alkaline- and human leukocyte elastase (HLE)-dependent elastin degradation. Our data suggest that among many elastin-derived peptides, only those with the GXX PG consensus sequence possess a conformation that allows binding to the EBP and a consequent triggering of signals responsible for the up-regulation pro-MMP-1 and pro-MMP-3. Finally, we have established that both secreted pro-enzymes can be activated after the addition of exogenous plasmin to the culture medium and then degrade a collagen substrate. Our results thus raise the possibility that elastin degradation could lead to collagenolysis during normal and/or pathological conditions. DISCUSSIONIt has been shown previously that interaction of elastin-derived peptides with the cell surface EBP leads to modulation of diverse gene expression and multiple cellular effects (17Jacob M.P.

Mecham R.P. Robert L. Verdetti J. Circ. Res. 1998; 82: 328-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Our data demonstrate that tropoelastin and elastin degradation products are potent inducers of collagenolytic enzyme expression in human skin fibroblasts. Interestingly, such an effect was attained even at elastin-derived peptide concentrations close to those determined in physiological fluids (41Fülöp Jr., T. Wei S.M. Robert L. Jacob M.P. Clin. Physiol. Biochem. 1990; 8: 273-282PubMed Google Scholar) and potentiated at higher concentrations, often detected during inflammatory processes (33Hornebeck W. Gogly B. Godeau G. Emonard H. Pellat B. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1999; 878: 625-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). The fact that this effect could be largely inhibited in the presence of lactose and reproduced by stimulation with VGVAPG and other peptides bearing the GXX PG consensus sequence suggests involvement of the EBP in signaling triggering pro-MMP-1 and pro-MMP-3 up-regulation.Among elastin-derived peptides, only those containing the GXX PG conformation have been identified as the ligands of the cell surface EBP and stimulators of numerous cellular effects (9Grosso L.E. Scott M. Matrix. 1993; 13: 157-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Our present results broaden the range of the biological activity of those peculiar peptides and provides a molecular explanation of their binding to the cell surface receptor.The assembly of tropoelastin into mature elastic fibers is also directed by the EBP (42Hinek A. Biol. Chem. 1996; 377: 471-480PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, it could be assumed that neither tropoelastin bound to this chaperone protein during its secretion from cells nor insoluble elastin surrounded in tissues by a mantle of microfibrils (43Sakai L.Y. Keene D.R. Engvall E. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 2499-2509Crossref PubMed Scopus (894) Google Scholar) could interact directly with cells under physiological conditions.The VGVAPG cell recognition domains are accessible on the surface of growing elastic fibers as shown using specific monoclonal antibodies (44Wrenn D.S.

Here we describe the solution structure of the first N-terminal MTCXXC metal-binding domain, Ccc2a, both in the presence and absence of Cu(I). For Cu(I)-Ccc2a, 1944 meaningful nuclear Overhauser effects were used to obtain a family of 35 structures with root mean square deviation to the average structure of 0.36 ± 0.06 A for the backbone and 0.79 ± 0.05 A for the heavy atoms. For apo-Ccc2a, 1970 meaningful nuclear Overhauser effects have been used with 353JHNHα to obtain a family of 35 structures with root mean square deviation to the average structure of 0.38 ± 0.06 A for the backbone and 0.82 ± 0.07 A for the heavy atoms. The protein exhibits a βαββαβ, ferrodoxin-like fold similar to that of its target Atx1 and that of a human counterpart, the fourth metal-binding domain of the Menkes protein. The overall fold remains unchanged upon copper loading, but the copper-binding site itself becomes less disordered. The helical context of the copper-binding site, and the copper-induced conformational changes in Ccc2a differ from those in Atx1. Ccc2a presents a conserved acidic surface which complements the basic surface of Atx1 and a hydrophobic surface. These results open new mechanistic aspects of copper transporter domains with physiological copper donor and acceptor proteins."

This implies that the probabilistic estimate for future earthquakes in southern California changed because of the Landers earthquake.

In this paper, the identification of the human 2-oxoadipate mitochondrial carrier (ODC)1is described. It is based on two isoforms, ODC1 and ODC2 encoded in the genome of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, that transport the oxodicarboxylates 2-oxoadipate and 2-oxoglutarate across the inner membranes of mitochondria (9Palmieri L.

However, yeast and man are too distant phylogenetically for these isoforms to provide a basis for direct cloning of the mammalian counterpart. Therefore, orthologs were sought and detected in Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila melanogaster and used to bridge between yeast and man. In this way, a human EST was identified that encodes a fragment of a related protein. It provided information to complete the human cDNA sequence. The encoded protein is 299 amino acids long and has the characteristic features of the family of mitochondrial carrier proteins (10Krämer R. Palmieri F. Ernster L. Molecular Mechanisms in Bioenergetics. Elsevier Science Publishers B. V., Amsterdam1992: 359-382Google Scholar, 11Walker J.E. Curr. Opin. Struct.

It was overexpressed in Escherichia coli, reconstituted into phospholipid vesicles, and shown to have transport specificity and other biochemical properties similar to those of the recombinant yeast ODC isoforms, including transport of 2-oxoadipate. Data bases of the genomes ofC. elegans and D. melanogaster at the Sanger Center (Hinxton, United Kingdom) and at the National Center for Biotechnology Information (Washington, D. C.) were screened with the sequences of the S. cerevisiae ODC proteins (9Palmieri L. Agrimi G. Runswick M.J. Fearnley I.M. Palmieri F. Walker J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1916-1922Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) using the program BLASTP. The NCBI nonredundant EST human data base was probed with the program TBLASTN. Amino acid sequences were aligned with ClustalW (version 1.7). Touchdown PCRs (14Don R.H. Cox P.T. Wainwright B.J. Baker K. Mattick J.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 4008Crossref PubMed Scopus (2240) Google Scholar) were performed with adaptor-ligated double-stranded human liver cDNA (1 ng, CLONTECH), as described previously (15Indiveri C. Iacobazzi V. Giangregorio N. Palmieri F. Biochem. J. 1997; 321: 713-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 16Fiermonte G. Palmieri L. Dolce V. Lasorsa F.M. Palmieri F. Runswick M.J. Walker J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24754-24759Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The full-length cDNA sequence was obtained in two PCR reactions of 5′- and 3′-extension using the adaptor primers AP1 and AP2 (CLONTECH) and a primer set 1F, 2F, 1R, and 2R (Fig. 1) designed from the nucleotide sequence of the human EST, R29313. The PCR products were identified, recovered from agarose gels, cloned into the pCR2.1 topo-vector (Invitrogen), and sequenced. The cDNA for rat ODC was amplified similarly with oligonucleotides based on the human cDNA sequence. Human metaphase chromosome spreads were obtained from phytohemagglutinin-stimulated peripheral lymphocytes. A probe for FISH analysis was made by PCR amplification of human genomic DNA using primers corresponding to nt 916–939 (forward sense) and nt 1191–1212 (reverse sense) of the human cDNA for ODC (see Fig. 1). The resulting 4.2-kb fragment was cloned in the pCR2.1 topo-vector and sequenced to confirm its identity. The FISH experiments were performed as described previously (17Pannone E. Fiermonte G. Dolce V. Rocchi M. Palmieri F. Cytogenet. Cell Genet. 1998; 83: 238-239Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Total RNAs (2 μg) were extracted and reverse-transcribed with the Gene Amp RNA PCR Core kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) using either random hexamers or oligo(dT)16 as primers (final volume, 40 μl). A 230-bp fragment of the ODC cDNA was then amplified from the reverse transcription reaction products (20 μl) by 35 cycles of PCR using oligonucleotides RT1F (nt 662–682) and RT1R (nt 869–892) as forward and reverse primers, respectively (Fig. 1). The products were probed with the radiolabeled oligonucleotide RT1P (nt 804–825; Fig. 1). As a control, a 384-bp β-actin fragment was amplified from the remainder of the reverse transcription products (18Dolce, V., Fiermonte, G., Runswick, M. J., Palmieri, F., and Walker, J. E. (2001) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A., 98, in press.Google Scholar). The coding regions for the human and rat ODCs were amplified from human and rat liver cDNAs (1 ng) by 35 cycles of PCR. The forward and reverse primers in these reactions corresponded to nt 311–331 and 1188–1210 of the human ODC cDNA (see Fig. 1) and to nt 100–120 and 976–996 of the rat ODC cDNA (deposited as GenBankTMaccession number AJ289714). The forward and reverse primers carried anNdeI and a XhoI site, respectively, at their 5′-ends. The 0.9-kb products were gel-purified and cloned into the pRUN expression vector. Transformants of E. coli DH5α cells were selected on ampicillin (100 μg/ml) and screened by direct colony PCR and restriction digestion of plasmids. The sequences of inserts were verified. The overproduction of the ODC as inclusion bodies in the cytosol of E. coli was accomplished as described first for the bovine oxoglutarate-malate carrier (19Fiermonte G. Walker J.E. Palmieri F. Biochem. J. 1993; 294: 293-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar), except that the host cells were E. coli CO214(DE3) (20Palmieri L. De Marco V. Iacobazzi V. Palmieri F. Runswick M.J. Walker J.E. FEBS Lett. 1997; 410: 447-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Control cultures with the empty vector were processed in parallel. Inclusion bodies were isolated, and ODC was purified by centrifugation and washing steps as described previously (19Fiermonte G. Walker J.E. Palmieri F. Biochem. J. 1993; 294: 293-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 21Palmieri L. Palmieri F. Runswick M.J. Walker J.E. FEBS Lett. 1996; 399: 299-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The recombinant protein in Sarkosyl was reconstituted into liposomes in the presence of substrates, as described previously (9Palmieri L. Agrimi G. Runswick M.J. Fearnley I.M. Palmieri F. Walker J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1916-1922Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). External substrate was removed from proteoliposomes on a Sephadex G-75 columns. The transport activity at 25 °C was determined by measuring the uptake (forward exchange) or the efflux (backward exchange) of [14C]oxoglutarate in exchange for unlabeled counter-substrates (22Palmieri F. Indiveri C. Bisaccia F. Iacobazzi V. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 260: 349-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). For backward exchange measurements the proteoliposomes containing 1 mm internal oxoglutarate were prelabeled, after reconstitution, by carrier-mediated exchange equilibration by adding 10 μm[14C]oxoglutarate (22Palmieri F. Indiveri C. Bisaccia F. Iacobazzi V. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 260: 349-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). After 30 min, the residual external radioactivity was removed by passing the proteoliposomes through a column of Sephadex G-75. In forward exchange reactions, transport was started by adding [14C]oxoglutarate to the proteoliposomes and in the backward exchanges by adding nonradioactive substrate. In both cases, transport was stopped after 1 min (in the initial linear range of substrate exchange) by addition of 10 mm pyridoxal 5′-phosphate and 10 mmbathophenanthroline (the “inibitor-stop” method (22Palmieri F. Indiveri C. Bisaccia F. Iacobazzi V. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 260: 349-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar)). In controls, the inhibitors were added at the beginning together with the external substrate. Finally, the external substrate was removed, and the radioactivity in the liposomes was measured (22Palmieri F. Indiveri C. Bisaccia F. Iacobazzi V. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 260: 349-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). In forward exchange measurements, the experimental values were corrected by subtracting control values, and the rate was calculated in millimoles/min/gram of protein. In the case of backward exchanges, the rate in Δcpm/min was obtained from the decrease of internal radioactivity in 1 min. The reconstituted protein was assayed for other exchange activities by the inhibitor-stop method (22Palmieri F. Indiveri C. Bisaccia F. Iacobazzi V. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 260: 349-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and stained with Coomassie blue dye. N-terminal sequencing was carried out as described previously (21Palmieri L. Palmieri F. Runswick M.J. Walker J.E. FEBS Lett. 1996; 399: 299-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The amount of pure ODC was estimated by laser densitometry of stained samples (21Palmieri L. Palmieri F. Runswick M.J. Walker J.E. FEBS Lett. 1996; 399: 299-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The amount of ODC incorporated into liposomes was measured as described previously (23Fiermonte G. Dolce V. Palmieri F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22782-22787Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) and varied between 29 and 37% of the protein added to the reconstitution mixture. Western blotting was carried out as described previously (24Bisaccia F. Capobianco L. Brandolin G. Palmieri F. Biochemistry. 1996; 33: 3705-3713Crossref Scopus (38) Google Scholar) with a rabbit antiserum raised against the bacterially expressed rat ODC protein. By screening data bases, nematode and fruit fly clones (R11.1 and AAF45544.1) were found with 36 and 38% of the residues of their encoded proteins identical, respectively, to the yeast ODC protein sequences. A human EST data base was interrogated with these sequences, and a clone of 286 bp (R29313) was identified that encoded a protein sequence that was 62 and 68% identical, respectively, to regions of the C. elegans and the D. melanogaster proteins. The human EST was extended in the 5′- and 3′-directions by two PCR experiments. Among the products of the 5′-extension reaction, one band of about 1200 bp hybridized with primer 2F. Its sequence overlapped the EST. The 3′-extension product contained a single band of about 950 bp. Its sequence overlapped the 5′-extension. The final human cDNA sequence of 2024 nucleotides (Fig. 1) consisted of a 310-bp 5′-untranslated region, followed by an open reading frame of 900 bp, a 814-bp 3′-untranslated region containing a polyadenylation signal at nt 1974–1979 (25Proudfoot N.J. Brownlee G.G. Nature. 1976; 263: 211-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (1906) Google Scholar), and a poly(A)+ tail (see Fig. 1). The ATG codon at nt 311–313 is preceded by an in-frame stop codon 102-bp upstream and is likely to be the translational initiation codon. The N terminus of the human protein is at approximately the same position as in the rat, yeast, nematode, and D. melanogaster orthologs, confirming this view. The open reading frame encoded a polypeptide of 299 amino acids with a calculated isoelectric point of 9.6 and a molecular mass of 33,300 Da. The cDNA for the rat ODC was cloned in a similar way. This sequence (GenBankTM accession number AJ289714) consists of 1456 nucleotides with a 99-bp 5′-untranslated region, followed by an open reading frame of 897 bp, and a 460-bp 3′-untranslated region, containing neither a polyadenylation signal nor a poly(A)+tail. The open reading frame encoded a polypeptide of 298 amino acids with a molecular mass of 33,276. The human ODC is 82, 56, 55, 32, and 33% identical to the R. norvegicus, C. elegans,D. melanogaster, and S. cerevisiae ODC1 and ODC2 proteins, respectively. The gene for human ODC was found on chromosome 14 at 14q11.2 by FISH experiments conducted on normal human metaphase chromosomes (Fig.2). There was no evidence in this experiment for a second gene encoding an isoform, and no isoforms were detected in searches of data bases of human, nematode, and fruit fly sequences. The tissue distribution of mRNAs for the human and rat ODCs was studied by RT-PCR performed on total RNA populations, using primers and probes from regions of identity between the human and the rat nucleotide sequences. The ODC was detected in all tissues that were examined (Fig.3 A, panel a). The relatively weak signal from heart arises because less total RNA was employed than in other tissues, as the control demonstrates (seepanel b in Fig. 3 A). A similar pattern of expression was observed by Western blot analysis of rat mitochondria (see Fig. 3 B, panel a). The human ODC was overexpressed in E. coli C0214(DE3) (see Fig.4, lane 4) in the form of inclusion bodies. The purified protein gave a single band by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 4, lane 5) with an apparent molecular mass of 32 kDa. The protein was not detected in bacteria harvested immediately before induction of expression (Fig. 4, lanes 1 and2), nor in cells harvested after induction but lacking the coding sequence in the expression vector (lane 3). The N-terminal sequence (SAKPEVSLVR) of residues 1–10 of the purified protein was identical to that predicted for residues 2–11 of the human ODC (Fig. 1). About 35 mg of purified protein were obtained per liter of culture. Proteoliposomes reconstituted with recombinant ODC catalyzed a counter-exchange of external [14C]oxoglutarate for internal oxoglutarate with first order kinetics (rate constant 0.08 min−1), isotopic equilibrium being approached exponentially (data not shown). The exchange reaction was inhibited completely by a mixture of pyridoxal 5′-phosphate and bathophenanthroline. In the absence of substrate in the proteoliposomes, or if the solubilized protein was boiled before the incorporation into liposomes, there was no uptake of labeled external substrate. Similarly, no oxoglutarate/oxoglutarate exchange was detected by reconstitution of Sarkosyl-solubilized material from bacterial cells either lacking the expression vector for ODC or harvested immediately before induction of expression. Furthermore, the proteoliposomes did not catalyze homoexchange activities for phosphate, carnitine, glutamate, aspartate, glutamine, ornithine,l-malate, ADP, and ATP (internal concentration, 10 mm; external concentration, 1 mm). The substrate specificity of human ODC was investigated in greater detail by measuring the uptake of [14C]oxoglutarate into proteoliposomes that had been preloaded with a variety of substrates (Fig. 5 A) or the efflux of [14C]oxoglutarate from proteoliposomes in the presence of external nonradioactive substrates (Fig. 5 B). High [14C]oxoglutarate transport activities were observed when oxoglutarate, oxoadipate, glutarate, and adipate were used as counter-substrates on both sides of the liposomal membrane. High activities were also found with external pimelate and oxopimelate. To a lesser extent, internal pimelate, oxopimelate, and 2-aminopimelate, as well as both internal and external 2-aminoadipate, citrate, and oxaloacetate, also exchanged for labeled oxoglutarate. Low exchange, if any, was found with aspartate, fumarate, glutamate, glutathione, isocitrate, malate, maleate, malonate, oxalate, pyruvate, suberate, and succinate (Fig. 5, A and B). The uptake of 0.2 mm [14C]oxoglutarate by proteoliposomes containing 20 mm oxoglutarate (reaction time, 1 min) was inhibited almost completely by 2 mmpyridoxal 5′-phosphate (97%) and partly by 2 mmbathophenanthroline and 2 mm 2-cyanocynnamate (73 and 69% inhibition, respectively). Low concentrations of organic mercurials (10 μm) also inhibited markedly the ODC activity (p-chloromercuribenzene sulfonate, 58%; HgCl2, 64%; and p-hydroxymercuribenzoate, 47%). No significant inhibition was observed with 2 mm butylmalonate, phenylsuccinate, 1,2,3-benzenetricarboxylate, andN-ethylmaleimide (inhibitors of other characterized mitochondrial carriers) and 10 μm carboxyatractyloside (a powerful inhibitor of the ADP/ATP carrier). To obtain kinetic information about the [14C]oxoglutarate/oxoglutarate exchange, the dependence of the exchange rate on substrate concentration was investigated at different concentrations of externally added [14C]oxoglutarate (0.05–2 mm) at a constant internal concentration of 20 mm. The transport affinity (K m) and the specific activity (V max) values for oxoglutarate exchange at 25 °C, calculated from a standard double-reciprocal set of 35 experiments, were 0.22 ± 0.02 mm and 7.5 ± 1.2 mmol/min/g of protein, respectively. The activity was calculated by taking into account the amount of ODC recovered in the proteoliposomes after reconstitution. The inhibition constants (K i) of several externally added substrates are summarized in TableI. All of them increased the apparentK m without changing the V maxof [14C]oxoglutarate/oxoglutarate exchange (not shown) acting as competitive inhibitors. In general, the oxoglutarate/oxoglutarate exchange was prevented by external addition of each of the substrates that are transported by human ODC (Fig. 5,A and B), and it was not affected by substrates of other mitochondrial carriers such as phosphate, ADP, ornithine, and carnitine. However, suberate, which is not transported by the ODC protein, inhibited the exchange activity significantly (Table I), suggesting that it binds to the substrate binding site of ODC without being transported.Table IKi values for substrates competing with [14C]oxoglutarate uptakeSubstrateK imm2-Oxoadipate0.11 ± 0.01Adipate0.14 ± 0.01Pimelate0.40 ± 0.04Glutarate0.70 ± 0.072-Oxopimelate1.18 ± 0.12Suberate6.6 ± 0.8Citrate11.5 ± 1.32-Aminoadipate12.7 ± 1.5Oxaloacetate18.7 ± 2.2l-Malate>252-Aminopimelate>25The K i values were calculated from double-reciprocal plots of the rate of [14C]oxoglutarate/oxoglutarate exchange under variation of external oxoglutarate.

The competing substrates were added simultaneously with [14C]oxoglutarate at the appropriate concentrations. The values are averages ± S.D. of at least three experiments.

The phylogenetic distance between S. cerevisiae and man frequently precludes the use of yeast sequences to identify human orthologs directly with certainty. The problem is even more severe when the protein in question is a member of a family with different functions but related sequences, as are the two isoforms of the yeast oxodicarboxylate carrier (9Palmieri L. Agrimi G. Runswick M.J. Fearnley I.M. Palmieri F. Walker J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1916-1922Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), which is a recently identified member of the family of mitochondrial transport proteins. Known family members are involved in the traffic of various substrates and metabolites across the inner membranes of the organelle. One possible solution, employed successfully in the cloning the rat dicarboxylate carrier (16Fiermonte G. Palmieri L. Dolce V. Lasorsa F.M. Palmieri F. Runswick M.J. Walker J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24754-24759Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), is to use the yeast sequence to identify orthologs in phylogenetically intermediate species where the genome sequence is known, such as C. elegans and D. melanogaster, and then to use these orthologs to identify potential orthologs in man. Thus, the yeast ODC isoforms were used to find clones in the C. elegans and D. melanogaster genomes, and they were used to identify a short related protein sequence in a human EST. This sequence proved to be part of the human ODC and provided the route to the complete human and rat ODC sequences. Both have the tripartite structure and the sequence motif that are characteristic of the mitochondrial carrier family (10Krämer R. Palmieri F. Ernster L. Molecular Mechanisms in Bioenergetics. Elsevier Science Publishers B. V., Amsterdam1992: 359-382Google Scholar, 11Walker J.E. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1992; 2: 519-526Crossref Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 12Palmieri F.

Kluwer Academic/Plenum Publishers, New York1999: 489-519Crossref Google Scholar). The transport characteristics of the human ODC are similar to the yeast ODC isoforms. The main differences are the ability of the human protein to transport 2-aminoadipate, although rather poorly, and its incapacity to transport l-malate. The properties of the human ODC differ markedly from those of the oxoglutarate-malate carrier, which has greatest affinities for C4 and C5 oxodicarboxylates and dicarboxylates (19Fiermonte G. Walker J.E. Palmieri F. Biochem. J. 1993; 294: 293-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 26Palmieri F. Quagliariello E. Klingenberger M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1972; 29: 408-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 27Bisaccia F. Indiveri C. Palmieri F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 810: 362-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), whereas the human ODC prefers the C5-C7 homologs (Fig. 5 and Table I). In contrast to the bovine oxoglutarate-malate carrier, the human ODC does not transport malate, succinate, and maleate, but it does transport citrate, albeit at low efficiency. The low sequence identity between the ODC and oxoglutarate-malate carrier is also consistent with their different properties and functions. The best substrates for the human ODC, both on the external and the internal membrane surfaces, are 2-oxoadipate and 2-oxoglutarate. Therefore, the physiological role of the human ODC is most likely to be to catalyze the uptake of 2-oxoadipate into the mitochondrial matrix in exchange for internal 2-oxoglutarate, thus performing a central role in catabolism of lysine, hydroxylysine, and tryptophan. Since ODC functions by a counter-exchange mechanism, the carrier-mediated uptake of 2-oxoadipate requires the efflux of a counter-substrate. On the basis of transport measurements, 2-oxoglutarate may serve as the counter-substrate of ODC for 2-oxoadipate. The efflux of 2-oxoglutarate is required by the lysine-oxoglutarate reductase, which, in the first step of lysine catabolism, converts lysine and 2-oxoglutarate into saccharopine. In agreement with its central role in cell metabolism, the human ODC is expressed in all tissues that were analyzed. Another possible role for the human ODC may be to catalyze the uptake of 2-aminoadipate into the mitochondrial matrix when this amino acid is not rapidly transaminated to 2-oxoadipate in the cytosol, for example after diets rich in amino acids that cause a decrease in 2-oxoglutarate content in the cytosol and consequently an inhibition of the 2-aminoadipate aminotransferase. In this respect it is worth mentioning that transaminases interconverting oxoadipate and aminoadipate are present both in the cytosol and inside the mitochondria (28Tobes M.C. Mason M. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 4591-4599Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Takeuchi F. Otsuka H. Shibata Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 743: 323-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The physiological role of ODC also suggests its possible involvement in 2-oxoadipate acidemia, which is accompanied by accumulation and excretion of large amounts of 2-oxoadipate, 2-aminoadipate and 2-hydroxyadipate in urine, and by the clinical symptoms of mental retardation, hypotonia, motor and developmental delay, cerebellar ataxia, and learning disability (1Przyrembel H.

The molecular defect(s) responsible for this disease have not been characterized. Fibroblasts of patients with this condition are unable to oxidize 2-amino[1-14C]adipic and 2-oxo[1-14C]adipic acid to 14CO2 (2Wendel U. Rudiger H.W. Przyrembel H. Bremer H.J. Clin. Chim.

Therefore, it was suggested that the disease may be due to defective 2-oxoadipate dehydrogenase, but no such defect has ever been demonstrated. The alternative possibility that defective ODC might provide the basis for this human metabolic disease can now be investigated."

Previous structural studies revealed a single Mg2+ ion-binding site inEscherichia coli RNase HI. In the crystal structure of the related RNase H domain of human immunodeficiency virus reverse transcriptase, however, two Mn2+ ions were observed suggesting a different mode of metal binding. E. coli RNase HI shows catalytic activity in the presence of Mg2+ or Mn2+ ions, but these two metals show strikingly different optimal concentrations. Mg2+ ions are required in millimolar concentrations, but Mn2+ ions are only required in micromolar quantities. Based upon the metal dependence of E. coli RNase HI activity, we proposed an activation/attenuation model in which one metal is required for catalysis, and binding of a second metal is inhibitory. We have now solved the co-crystal structure of E. coli RNase HI with Mn2+ ions at 1.9-Å resolution. Two octahedrally coordinated Mn2+ ions are seen to bind to the enzyme-active site. Residues Asp-10, Glu-48, and Asp-70 make direct (inner sphere) coordination contacts to the first (activating) metal, whereas residues Asp-10 and Asp-134 make direct contacts to the second (attenuating) metal. This structure is consistent with biochemical evidence suggesting that two metal ions may bind RNase H but liganding a second ion inhibits RNase H activity.1G15 Ribonuclease H (RNase H) selectively degrades the RNA strand of RNA·DNA hybrids in a divalent cation-dependent manner.

Based upon the metal dependence of E. coli RNase HI activity, we proposed an activation/attenuation model in which one metal is required for catalysis, and binding of a second metal is inhibitory. We have now solved the co-crystal structure of E. coli RNase HI with Mn2+ ions at 1.9-Å resolution. Two octahedrally coordinated Mn2+ ions are seen to bind to the enzyme-active site. Residues Asp-10, Glu-48, and Asp-70 make direct (inner sphere) coordination contacts to the first (activating) metal, whereas residues Asp-10 and Asp-134 make direct contacts to the second (attenuating) metal. This structure is consistent with biochemical evidence suggesting that two metal ions may bind RNase H but liganding a second ion inhibits RNase H activity.1G15 human immunodeficiency virus The RNase H class of enzymes cleaves the RNA moiety of RNA·DNA hybrids in a divalent cation-dependent manner leaving 5′-phosphate and 3′-hydroxyl products. RNase H proteins are found in a wide variety of organisms ranging from bacteria to vertebrates (for review see Refs. 1Crouch R.J. New Biol. 1990; 2: 771-777PubMed Google Scholar and 2Hostomsky Z. Hostomska Z. Matthews D.A. Linn S.M. Lloyd R.S. Roberts R.J. Nucleases. 2 Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1993: 341-376Google Scholar). From a medical perspective, the most significant function of RNase H is its critical action in the life cycle of retroviruses such as the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).1 This activity arises from the C-terminal region of reverse transcriptase. The RNase H domain from HIV is homologous to other members of this class including RNase HI from Escherichia coli. Because inhibiting RNase H activity prohibits production of infectious virions (3Tisdale M. Schulze T. Larder B.A. Moelling K. J. Gen. Virol. 1991; : 59-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), understanding the function and mechanism of RNase H is an important avenue toward the development of anti-retroviral compounds. RNase H requires divalent cations (either Mg2+ or Mn2+) for catalysis. Five conserved residues form the metal-binding active site of RNase H (Fig. 1 a). Two RNases H with metal ions bound have been studied by x-ray crystallography.E. coli RNase HI binds a single Mg2+ ion via three carboxylates (Asp-10, Glu-48, and Asp-70) that form Site 1 (4Katayanagi K.

Proteins. 1993; 17: 337-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), whereas the HIV RNase H domain shows two Mn2+ ions, one in a position similar to Site 1 and another (Site 2) liganded by the equivalents of Asp-10 and Asp-134 (6Davies J.D. Hostomska Z. Hostomsky Z. Jordan S.R. Matthews D.A. Science. 1991; 252: 88-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar). Mutations in RNases H, which eliminate Mg2+-dependent activity, often allow retention of Mn2+-dependent activity (7Stahl S.J. Kaufman J.D. Vikic T.S. Crouch R.J. Wingfield P.T.

This, together with the different stoichiometry observed via crystallography, raises the possibility of alternate binding modes and/or catalytic requirements for these metals. In E. coliRNase HI, conservative mutation of the residues comprising Site 1 (Asp-10, Glu-48, and Asp-70) eliminates activity (12Kanaya S. Kohara A. Miura Y. Sekiguchi A. Iwai S. Inoue H. Ohtsuka E. Ikehara M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 4615-4621Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whereas mutations of the conserved histidine (His-124) (13Oda Y. Yoshida M. Kanaya S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 88-92Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and aspartate (Asp-134) of Site 2 (14Haruki M. Noguchi E. Nakai C. Liu Y.Y. Oobatake M. Itaya M. Kanaya S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 220: 623-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) have smaller effects on catalysis. Despite structural efforts to identify additional weaker binding sites (5Katayanagi K. Okumura M. Morikawa K. Proteins. 1993; 17: 337-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), no metal binding to Site 2 in E. coli RNase HI has been reported. Our laboratory has recently proposed a model for the metal dependence of E. coli RNase HI termed an “activation/attenuation mechanism” (15Keck J. Goedken E.R. Marqusee S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34128-34133Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). In this model, a single metal bound at Site 1 is required for catalysis, and the binding of a second metal at Site 2 reduces catalysis ∼100-fold. In this report, we present a high resolution crystal structure of E. coli RNase HI in complex with Mn2+ ions. These data demonstrate that the active site of E. coli RNase HI can bind two Mn2+ ions in the sites predicted by the activation/attenuation hypothesis. Furthermore, we show that the surprising dependence of RNase H activity in the presence of Mn2+ upon ionic strength can also be explained by this model. Kunkel mutagenesis (16Kunkel T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 488-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (4903) Google Scholar) of pSM101 (carrying a synthetic gene directing the expression of RNase H*, a cysteine-free variant of E. coli RNase HI) was used to create pEG120 which encodes for K87A RNase H*. DNA sequencing confirmed the incorporation of the desired mutation. RNase H* and K87A proteins were overexpressed in E. coli and purified by cation-exchange chromatography as described previously (15Keck J. Goedken E.R. Marqusee S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34128-34133Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Mass spectrometry confirmed the expected molecular mass of purified proteins within 1 Da (data not shown). Radiolabeled RNA·DNA hybrid was synthesized from M13K07 single-stranded DNA, and RNase H assays were conducted as described previously (8Keck J.L. Marqusee S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2740-2744Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). RNase H reaction assays were carried out in standard conditions of 50 mmTris, pH 8.0, 1 μm (base pairs) RNA·DNA hybrid, 2.5% glycerol, 0.1 mg/ml linear polyacrylamide, 1.5 μm bovine serum albumin with the indicated concentrations of divalent cation (MnCl2 or MgCl2) and NaCl at 37 °C. The acid-soluble radioactivity (cleaved product) present in the supernatant was determined by liquid scintillation counting. Specific activity (units/mg) was determined from the slope of multiple assay time points in the linear range of enzymatic activity. One unit of RNase H activity is defined as the amount of enzyme needed to generate 1 μmol of acid-soluble product in 15 min under our reaction conditions. Crystals of K87A RNase H* were grown by the hanging-drop vapor diffusion method in 1 mmMnCl2, 20 mm Hepes, pH 8, 16% PEG-3350 with 6 mg/ml protein. Except for the metal ions, these conditions are similar to those used previously for the crystallization of wild-type E. coli RNase HI (17Yang W. Hendrickson W.A. Kalman E.T. Crouch R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 13553-13559Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and for RNase H* (Goedken et al.(38Goedken E.R. Keck J.L. Berger J.M. Marqusee S. Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 1914-1921Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar)). Small needle-like crystals unsuitable for x-ray analysis frequently grew under these conditions. Occasionally, larger rod-shaped crystals suitable for x-ray diffraction appeared, growing to a maximum size of ∼600 × ∼15 × ∼15 μm within 4 weeks. Crystals were flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen directly from the drop conditions without the need for additional cryo-protectants. X-ray diffraction data were collected at the Advanced Light Source (Beamline 5.0.2) at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. Diffraction data were integrated and scaled using MOSFLM and SCALA (18Collaborative Computational Project Number 4 Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19797) Google Scholar) under the control of Wedger Elves (kindly provided by J. Holton). The K87A RNase H*/Mn2+ co-crystal structure was solved by molecular replacement via AMoRe (19Navaza J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1994; 50: 157-163Crossref Scopus (5030) Google Scholar) using the RNase H* coordinates (Protein Data Bank code 1F21) (38Goedken E.R. Keck J.L. Berger J.M. Marqusee S. Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 1914-1921Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Models were initially refined using REFMAC (20Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13914) Google Scholar) and later by the crystallography and NMR system (21Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse- Kunstleve R.W.

Between refinement cycles, manual rebuilding into 2F o − F c andF o − F c maps was performed using O (22Jones T. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgarrd M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13014) Google Scholar). Immediately after molecular replacement, difference density attributable to two octahedrally coordinated Mn2+ions was observed in the enzyme-active site.

Open table in a new tab The coordinates of the RNase H*/Mn2+ structure have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank (1G15). Although E. coli RNase HI can use either Mn2+ or Mg2+ for activity, these divalent metals lead to very different activity profiles (9Keck J.L. Marqusee S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19883-19887Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 15Keck J. Goedken E.R. Marqusee S. J. Biol.

Academic Press, New York1997: 409-416Google Scholar). The metal dependence of RNase H*, the cysteine-free version of E. coliRNase HI, is shown in Fig. 1 b. (This variant shows metal dependence that is identical to that of the wild-type enzyme.) In the presence of Mg2+ ions and moderate ionic strength (50 mm NaCl), the enzyme is activated in the low mm range (0.5–10 mm) and is repressed by very large concentrations of divalent metal (>10 mm). This activation profile is in contrast to that in the presence of Mn2+. This ion activates the enzyme at low metal concentrations over a narrow range (to ∼2 μm), and additional metal inhibits the protein. The activity at 1 mm Mn2+ is ∼100-fold decreased from its maximum at 2 μm Mn2+ (15Keck J. Goedken E.R. Marqusee S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34128-34133Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Mutations in residue Asp-134 produce an enzyme that shares the activation profiles of the wild-type protein but shows a large increase in the Mn2+ concentrations required to inhibit the enzyme (15Keck J. Goedken E.R. Marqusee S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34128-34133Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). These observations led to the proposal of the activation/attenuation model for RNase H (15Keck J. Goedken E.R. Marqusee S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34128-34133Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) in which a metal ion in Site 1 activates catalysis and the binding of another ion in Site 2 attenuates activity. To bolster the activation/attenuation model, we sought structural identification of the location and liganding geometry of Mn2+ ions at the activating and attenuating sites ofE. coli RNase HI. Cysteine-free E. coli RNase H* crystallizes in an orthorhombic lattice (38Goedken E.R. Keck J.L. Berger J.M. Marqusee S. Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 1914-1921Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), but our attempts to identify bound metal ions in these crystal forms either by co-crystallization or by soaking into existing crystals were unsuccessful. That is, diffraction data to greater than 1.8-Å resolution were obtained for a crystal grown in the presence of 5 mm MgCl2 that was isomorphous to the apo-crystals. After molecular replacement with the apo-structure, however, no electron density attributable to metal ions was observed in the active site (data not shown). Similar results were found for 24-h soaks of RNase H* crystals in 20 mm MgCl2 or 8 mm MnCl2 (data not shown). Examination of lattice contacts in these orthorhombic crystals showed that the positively charged side chain of residue Lys-87 from a symmetry mate in the lattice protruded into the negatively charged enzyme-active site. We hypothesized that this crystal contact altered the electrostatic environment and accessibility of the metal-binding pocket precluding the entry of divalent cations. In a single enzyme monomer, Lys-87 is distant from the active site and is unlikely to influence metal binding. We therefore created a mutant of E. coli RNase H* lacking this residue (K87A) expecting that this variant would crystallize in the same lattice but allow liganding of divalent metals. K87A did not form the expected orthorhombic crystals in the presence or absence of divalent metal even when microseeded with RNase H* crystals; however, high quality hexagonal crystals did appear in conditions containing 1 mm MnCl2 at pH 8. The K87A hexagonal crystals diffract to 1.9 Å at a synchotron source and belong to the space group P63, having one protein molecule per asymmetric unit. We solved the structure of K87A RNase H* using the molecular replacement method with the metal-free RNase H* structure as the probe molecule. Data collection and refinement statistics are summarized in Table I. Overall the structure of K87A (Fig. 2) is highly similar to the RNase H* structure; comparison of the C-α coordinates (24Holm L. Sander C. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 233: 123-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (3566) Google Scholar) of K87A to structures determined previously gave a root mean square deviation of 0.8 Å to the cysteine-free RNase H* and 1.0 Å to the wild-type protein. In addition to disordered N and C termini (residues 1–2 and 153–155), two loops, those between helices C and D (residues 92–96) and the loop between strand V and helix E containing a conserved histidine (residues 122–125, the “His-containing loop”), were disordered in the crystal. After molecular replacement, two difference density peaks lying 4.0 Å apart were easily identified in the electron density. Because they displayed canonical octahedral liganding geometry and no other divalent metals were present in the crystallization conditions, these peaks can be clearly identified as Mn2+ ions. Representative 2F o − F c maps calculated using the phases from the final model are shown in Fig. 2. At full occupancy both ions refined to low temperature factors (∼15 Å2) similar to the surrounding residues, suggesting these binding sites are fully occupied and that the data are well accounted for by the Mn2+ ions in the model. In comparison to the metal-free structure (Protein Data Bank accession code 1F21) (38Goedken E.R. Keck J.L. Berger J.M. Marqusee S. Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 1914-1921Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), there are notable changes in the geometry of the active site. The side chain of Glu-48 flips dramatically toward the carboxylate pocket, and His-124 is no longer visible in the structure. The positions of the side chains Asp-10, Asp-70, and Asp-134, however, change very little in the co-crystal structure. Both metal ions have octahedral coordination with positions occupied either by protein atoms or solvent molecules. The first Mn2+ ion (Mn2+ 1) makes inner sphere (nonwater-mediated) contacts to the carboxylate oxygens of Asp-10, Glu-48, and Asp-70. The three remaining coordination sites on the ion are occupied by water molecules, one of which (Water 2) appears to interact with the other carboxylate oxygen of Asp-70. The second Mn2+ ion (Mn2+ 2) is coordinated by inner sphere contacts to Asp-10 and Asp-134 of the same molecule; an inner sphere contact to Glu-131 from an adjacent symmetry mate is also observed. Water molecules occupy the remaining coordination sites of the Mn2+ 2, one of which, Water 2, is shared between the two metal ions. Both metals are therefore “bridged” by having contacts both to Asp-10 and Water 2 suggesting that both metals can bind simultaneously. The water molecules making coordination contacts to the divalent metal ions may be replaced by contacts from the nucleic acid substrate during the RNase H reaction. How do these metal-binding sites compare with those previously observed? Fig.3 shows a comparison of crystallographic metal binding studies in RNases H. The position of the Mn2+ions and the conformation of liganding homologous residues in the HIV RNase H domain from reverse transcriptase (observed at 2.4 Å resolution) (6Davies J.D. Hostomska Z. Hostomsky Z. Jordan S.R. Matthews D.A. Science. 1991; 252: 88-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar) are similar to that observed for K87A E. coli RNase HI in the presence of Mn2+. In contrast, the conformation of the active site residues Asp-10 and Glu-48 in the Mg2+ co-crystal with E. coli RNase HI (observed at 2.8 Å resolution (5Katayanagi K. Okumura M. Morikawa K. Proteins. 1993; 17: 337-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar)) is different from what we observed in our 1.9-Å structure with Mn2+ ions. In particular, the single Mg2+ ion is displaced away from Asp-70 such that it can no longer make direct contact with the metal ion as observed for Mn2+ 1 in our structure. The difference in precise positioning of the ion in Site 1 is interesting because solution studies on both E. coli RNase HI (25Kanaya S. Oobatake M. Liu Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32729-32736Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) and Moloney murine leukemia virus RNase H (26Goedken E.R. Marqusee S. Protein Eng. 1999; 12: 975-980Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) suggest that Asp-70 (or its homologue) is more important for metal affinity than is Glu-48. Given the variable position of metal ions observed crystallographically, it is conceivable that in solution metals can adopt several positions in the active site. This may prove relevant for the enzymatic mechanism as first suggested by Kanaya et al. (25Kanaya S. Oobatake M. Liu Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32729-32736Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Alternatively, the presence of a metal at Site 2 may induce conformational changes in the Site 1 causing movement of the ion toward Asp-70. Although x-ray crystallography demonstrates that a Mn2+ ion can bind at Site 2, proving that this metal is inhibitory as predicted by the activation/attenuation model is more difficult. Examination of the metal-dependent activity of RNase H* in the presence of Mn2+ or Mg2+ ions as a function of ionic strength, however, has proved informative (see Fig. 4 a). In particular, we noted that as NaCl concentrations were increased, the catalytic behavior of RNase H in the presence of 1 mmMnCl2 was very different from that in 1 mmMgCl2. The enzyme was strongly inhibited by increasing ionic strength in the presence of fixed amounts of Mg2+(where based upon crystallographic data we expect the involvement of one ion). In contrast, in the presence of Mn2+ (where we expect two ions to be bound by RNase H), activity levels increased as NaCl concentrations rose. This was a surprising result; a priori we had expected that NaCl would inhibit activity in the presence of either metal due to shielding of electrostatic effects that contribute to the affinity of the enzyme for its substrate and/or for its cofactor. Nonetheless, under conditions where the enzyme is attenuated by high Mn2+ concentrations, this attenuation appears to be partly relieved by increased ionic strength. Furthermore, it seems unlikely that the conformation of the RNA·DNA hybrid was altered by additional NaCl making it less susceptible to RNase H degradation because NaCl has the opposite effect (inhibition) in the presence of Mg2+. We subsequently found that addition of NaCl did indeed repress activity at other lower Mn2+ (0.5 and 2 μm) concentrations (Fig. 4 b). Hence, under metal concentrations where we expect at most one ion to be bound (the activation regime in Fig. 1 a), we detected strict inhibition by increasing NaCl concentrations. At 20 μm Mn2+ where the attenuating site becomes populated at low ionic strength (10–50 mm NaCl), we observed a maximum activity at intermediate (200 mm) concentrations of NaCl, followed by a decrease of activity at higher concentrations of salt. Fig. 4 c shows the Mn2+ dependence of RNase H activity at a series of different NaCl concentrations. This shows a displacement to higher divalent metal concentration on both the activation and attenuation regimes as the NaCl concentration increases. Furthermore, the maximum activity of the enzyme was also decreased at high ionic strengths, probably because of electrostatic shielding of RNase H from nucleic acid. We believe these data indicate that NaCl nonspecifically competes for the same sites as the Mn2+ions and thereby reduces the apparent binding affinity of each divalent metal. The unexpected increases in activity as the NaCl concentrations increase in 1 mm Mn2+ samples likely stem from the reduction in affinity for the second (attenuating) Mn2+ion. In this case, then, the overall effect of increased ionic strength was a loss of a Mn2+ ion in Site 2. The removal of the metal ion in Site 2 is expected to relieve the attenuation and overcome the decreased affinity for the substrate to give rise to a net increase in activity. Consistent with this idea, in the presence of Mg2+ concentrations from 0.1 to 50 mm (where we expect a single metal in Site 1), we found only inhibition as NaCl concentrations are increased (data not shown). RNase H catalyzes the disruption of the phosphodiester backbone of the RNA portion of RNA·DNA heteroduplexes in a divalent cation-dependent manner. This reaction requires a concerted deprotonation of water to form a nucleophilic hydroxide to attack the scissile phosphate of the RNA. Several different conserved active-site residues have been proposed to be the nucleophile-producing general base for this reaction including Glu-48, Asp-70, and His-124 (5Katayanagi K. Okumura M.

RNase H is believed to require metal cofactors because divalent cations stabilize the negatively charged pentacovalent phosphorane intermediate of the nuclease reaction. The stoichiometry of metal ions to the RNase H active site has been evaluated by a number of methods. X-ray crystallography (5Katayanagi K. Okumura M. Morikawa K.

Based upon these data and the metal dependence of RNase H activity (Fig. 1 b), our laboratory proposed an “activation/attenuation model.” This model posits that the first metal to bind RNase H is required for activity and occupies Site 1 (formed by the side chains of Asp-10, Glu-48, and Asp-70). A second metal with weaker affinity can occupy Site 2 (composed of the side chains of Asp-134 and possibly Asp-10 and His-124). This inhibitory metal accounts for the reduction of activity to ∼1% of maximal value at higher Mn2+ concentrations. By using x-ray crystallography, we have demonstrated that a Mn2+ ion can bind to Site 2. Mutagenesis of Asp-134 to less polar residues His and Asn results in an active enzyme with a decreased attenuation at high Mn2+ concentrations (15Keck J. Goedken E.R. Marqusee S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34128-34133Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). We observed that Asp-134 (along with Asp-10) makes direct inner sphere contacts to the second Mn2+ ion. Those results together with the observation that increasing ionic strength unexpectedly relieves the inhibition of RNase H at high Mn2+ concentration (Fig. 4) strongly suggest that the ion observed in Site 2 is inhibitory. E. coli RNase HI requires very different concentrations of Mg2+ ions than Mn2+ ions for optimal activity (Fig. 1 b). The enzyme shows a greater maximum activity in the presence of Mg2+ than in the presence of Mn2+ ions. Whether the inhibition observed at very high Mg2+ concentration (Fig. 1 b) results from weak binding by Mg2+ at Site 2 is unclear. However, given the large ionic strength of the reaction conditions of those samples, it seems equally likely that a reduction in the electrostatic affinity for the nucleic acid substrate gives rise to this inhibition. Although it is difficult to evaluate the free concentrations of divalent metal ionsin vivo, it should be noted that the concentration at which Mg2+ activates the enzyme (0.5–5 mm) approximates physiological values (34Snavely M.D. Sigel H. Metal Ions in Biological Systems. 20. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1990: 155-175Google Scholar, 35Williams R.J.P. Birch N.J. Magnesium and the Cell. Academic Press, Boston, MA1993: 15-29Google Scholar). Mn2+ ions, which are found at much smaller concentrations in vivo, bind the enzyme much more tightly (apparent K d ∼1 μm), and Mn2+ can inhibit RNase H activity in the presence of Mg2+ (15Keck J. Goedken E.R. Marqusee S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34128-34133Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Therefore, we speculate that both ions may be relevant for the physiological regulation of RNase H activity. Notably, the attenuation of E. coli RNase HI via second metal binding does not eliminate all activity. Mutation in the conserved active-site histidine (His-124) eliminates attenuation at high Mn2+ concentrations but allows maximal activity that reaches only the attenuated rates of the wild-type protein (15Keck J. Goedken E.R. Marqusee S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34128-34133Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). This led to the suggestion that attenuation at Site 2 occurs by removing the action of His-124. Two alternative ways metal binding at Site 2 could neutralize the histidine (presumably by eliminating a role in acid/base catalysis) were proposed: 1) that His-124 was directly involved in liganding the second metal-binding site or 2) that binding of a metal ion at Site 2 hinders activity because the His-containing loop is flipped out away from the active site. This loop has been seen in separate conformations in the apo-form (4Katayanagi K. Miyagawa M. Matsushima M. Ishikawa M. Kanaya S. Ikehara M. Matsuzaki T. Morikawa K. Nature. 1990; 347: 306-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar, 36Yang W. Hendrickson W.A. Crouch R.J. Satow Y. Science. 1990; 249: 1398-1405Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar), one with the histidine side chain near the active site as in Fig. 1 a and the other where it is displaced away from the catalytic pocket. As the entire His-containing loop is disordered in the Mn2+co-crystal, it is unlikely that His-124 is directly involved in the liganding of the Site 2 metal. Thus, in light of the x-ray structure, the second possibility that His-124 is neutralized by second metal binding via increased flexibility of the His-containing loop seems more reasonable. The RNase H/Mn2+ co-crystal structure presented here provides direct structural evidence that E. coli RNase HI can bind two metal ions in the absence of substrate. Numerous conflicting proposals have been made regarding the number of metal ions necessary for activity and the precise catalytic mechanism of ribonuclease H (5Katayanagi K. Okumura M. Morikawa K.

It is unclear which co-crystal (Mg2+ or Mn2+) most closely approximates the position of the metal in Site 1 during catalysis on a nucleic acid. Our x-ray data indicate that all of the conserved carboxylates in the active site of RNase H can make direct contacts to divalent metals. Whether RNase H uses any of these side chains as a general base to deprotonate solvent molecule remains an open question. To evaluate which residues (if any) are the general base and acid of the nuclease reaction and how the RNA strand of RNA·DNA hybrids is recognized, a co-crystal of RNase H bound to substrate and/or substrate analogs will likely be required.

In healthy individuals, plasma total homocysteine (the sum of homocysteine and the homocysteinyl derivatives homocystine and cysteine-homocysteine, whether free or bound to proteins) was between 5 and 15 μm (2Kang S.S.

In vitro studies provide evidence that supraphysiologic homocysteine levels have a direct toxic effect on the endothelium, probably through free radical generation during oxidation of the homocysteine sulfhydryl group (18Loscalzo J.

Homocysteine has also been reported to impair the binding of tissue-type plasminogen activator to its endothelial cell receptor, annexin II (20Hajjer K.A. J. Clin.

The most important function of this pathway appears to be the inactivation of factor Va, the essential cofactor for the prothrombinase complex which converts prothrombin to thrombin. Human factor V (M r = 330,000) is activated by α-thrombin cleavages at Arg-709, Arg-1018, and Arg-1545 (27Nesheim M.E. Mann K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 1326-1334Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Jenny R.J. Pittman D.D. Toole J.J. Kriz R.W. Aldape R.A. Hewick R.M. Kaufman R.J. Mann K.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 4846-4850Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). The product, factor Va, is composed of a heavy chain, residues 1–709 (M r = 105,000), derived from the NH2terminus of factor V (A1-A2 domains) and a noncovalently associated light chain, residues 1546–2196 (M r = 74,000), derived from the COOH terminus (A3-C1-C2 domains) (27Nesheim M.E.

Factor Va is proteolytically inactivated by activated protein C (APC)1 by three cleavages of the heavy chain at Arg-506, Arg-306, and Arg-679 (29Kalafatis M. Mann K.G. J. Biol.

The cleavage of factor Va at Arg-506 is enhanced in the presence of a phospholipid surface, whereas cleavage at Arg-306 is lipid-dependent (30Kalafatis M. Rand M.D. Mann K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31869-31880Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After cleavage at Arg-306, the A2 domain (residues 307–709) dissociates as two fragments (residues 307–506 and 507–709) from the factor Va molecule, leading to the complete inactivation of factor Va (31Mann K.G.

The regulation of factor Va is a key process for maintaining hemostasis, as evidenced by two congenital thrombotic disorders,i.e. the G1691A mutation (Arg-506 to Gln) in factor V Leiden and protein C deficiency (33Bertina R.M. Koeleman B.P.C. Koster T. Rosendaal F.R. Dirven R.J. de Ronde H. van der Velden P.A. Reitsma P.H. Nature. 1994; 369: 64-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (3823) Google Scholar, 34Lane D.A. Mannucci P.M.

There is also evidence for impaired factor Va inactivation by APC in the absence of the factor V Leiden mutation, which is associated with increased risk of venous thrombosis (35de Visser M.C. Rosendaal F.R. Bertina R.M. Blood. 1999; 93: 1271-1276Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The present study was undertaken to evaluate the ability of homocysteine at concentrations of 1 mm or less to modulate activation of human factor V and inactivation of human factor Va. We examined the effect of homocysteine on these processes using clotting assays and Western blot analyses along with radiolabeling of factor V by [35S]homocysteine. Our data suggest a potential contributor to the prothrombotic tendency observed in hyperhomocysteinemia. dl-Homocysteine, l-homocystine,dl-homocysteine thiolactone, and l-cysteine as well as HEPES were purchased from Sigma. 1,2-Dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-[phospho-l-serine] (sodium salt) (PS) and 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphatidylcholine (PC) were purchased from Avanti (Alabaster, AL). Acrylamide, bisacrylamide, TEMED, ammonium persulfate, and nitrocellulose were purchased from Bio-Rad. Pooled normal plasma (number of donors >30) was purchased from George King Bio-Medical (Overland Park, KS). Factor V was purified from human plasma by immunoaffinity chromatography as previously described (36Katzmann J.A. Nesheim M.E. Hibbard L.S. Mann K.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 162-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Factor V concentrations were estimated spectrophotometrically. Human APC and α-thrombin were gifts from Hematologic Technologies Inc. (Essex Junction, VT). Hirudin was obtained from Genentech (South San Francisco, CA). Phospholipid vesicles (PCPS) composed of 75% PC and 25% PS were prepared according to Barenholz et al. (37Barenholz Y. Gibbes D. Litman B.J. Goll J. Thompson T.E. Carlson F.D. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 2806-2810Crossref PubMed Scopus (729) Google Scholar), with the concentrations determined by phosphorous assay. Monoclonal antibodies against the heavy chain of human factor Va (αFVaHC 17) were from the Biochemistry Antibody Core Laboratory (University of Vermont). Goat anti-mouse IgG peroxidase was purchased from Southern Biotech (Birmingham, AL). Molecular weight standards were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. The chemiluminescent substrate, luminol, was purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences as was the fluorography reagent, Entensify.l-[35S]Methionine andl-[35S]cysteine were purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Factor V was dialyzed against 20 mm HEPES, 0.15 m NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2, pH 7.4 (HBS-Ca2+) with or without the addition of homocysteine or other thiols (solubilized in 0.15 m HCl) at varying concentrations at 4 °C for 2 h followed by dialysis against HBS-Ca2+ for 2 h. Homocystine was solubilized in 0.15 m HCl. Factor V was activated by treatment with 1 nm α-thrombin for 10–13 min at 37 °C. α-Thrombin was inhibited by the addition of hirudin at a 4–5-fold molar excess. APC at various concentrations (see legends to figures) was added to factor Va in the presence or absence of phospholipids. At selected time intervals, samples were removed and diluted into HBS-Ca2+ for assay. Factor Va activity was immediately measured in a clotting assay at 37 °C using factor V-deficient plasma (38Nesheim M.E. Katzmann J.A. Tracy P.B. Mann K.G. Lorand L. Methods in Enzymology, Proteolytic Enzymes Part C. Academic Press, Inc., New York1981: 249-285Google Scholar). In a typical assay, 50 μl of factor V or Va diluted in HBS-Ca2+ was added to an equal volume of factor V-deficient human plasma followed by the addition of 100 μl of PT (prothrombin time) reagent (Simplastin, Organon Teknika, Durham, NC). All experiments were repeated three times on separate days with comparable results. Time course data for the APC inactivation of factor Va were fit to a single exponential equation using software IGOR Pro Version 3.1, WaveMetrics Inc. (Lake Oswego, OR). Initial slopes from the fit curves were used to calculate the pseudo first order rate constants. Pseudo first order rate constants are all normalized to constant APC concentration (2.5 nm). Aliquots from the activation/inactivation experiments were withdrawn and quenched in 2% β-mercaptoethanol, 2% SDS for electrophoretic analysis. Samples were separated on a 5 to 15% linear gradient gel (SDS-PAGE) under reducing conditions according to Laemmli (39Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207227) Google Scholar). Transfer from the gel to nitrocellulose (Bio-Rad) was performed as previously described (40Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44923) Google Scholar). Immunoreactive fragments were detected using the monoclonal antibody αFVaHC 17, which recognizes an epitope located between residues 307 and 506 in the heavy chain of factor Va (41Kalafatis M. Bertina R.M. Rand M.D. Mann K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4053-4057Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Blots were developed using the Renaissance chemiluminescent reagent (Dupont). Film was developed in a Kodak X-Omat on Reflection film (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Densitometry of immunoblots was performed on a Hewlett-Packard ScanJet 4C/T equipped with a transparency adapter for backlighting the x-ray film (Hewlett-Packard, Palo Alto, CA) and analyzed using NIH Image 1.6 (Bethesda, MD). Factor V was dialyzed against HBS-Ca2+ containing 1 mmβ-mercaptoethanol (BME) or 2 mm homocysteine (HCY) for 2 h at 4 °C and then for 2 h at 4 °C against HBS-Ca2+. Dialysis was performed in filled, capped bottles in buffer that had been boiled in a reflux apparatus and purged extensively with nitrogen. The resulting stocks, FVBME (2.2 μm) and FVHCY (2.0 μm) were used immediately. FVHCY could be flash-frozen in methanol/dry ice and successfully recovered, whereas FVBMEproved sensitive to freezing, showing a decrease in APC sensitivity after thawing. Mixtures of FVBME and FVHCY with a total factor V concentration of 400 nm in which the amount of FVHCY varied from 0 to 100% were constructed by appropriate dilution in HBS-Ca2+, and their relative susceptibility to APC proteolysis assessed by a modification of the method of Dahlback (42Dahlback B.

Five μl of each factor V mixture was added to 95 μl of factor V-deficient (immunodepleted) plasma followed by the addition of 100 μl of aPTT (activated partial thromboplastin time) reagent (Organon Teknika). This reformulated plasma ([factor V] = 20 nm) was incubated for 5 min at 37 °C. One hundred μl of 3 nm APC in HBS-30 mmCa2+ or 100 μl of HBS-30 mm Ca2+was then added, the mixture rocked at 37 °C, and clotting time was recorded. Clotting times were plotted against the percentage of FVBME present. Best-fit lines were determined by linear regression analysis. The slopes of these lines from 3 separate sets of FVBME/FVHCY mixtures varied by less than 10%. To assay plasma, 100 μl of patient or normal plasma was combined directly with 100 μl of aPTT reagent and then processed as above. Plasma samples from individuals with elevated homocysteine levels were a generous gift from Dr. Andrzej Szczeklik, Jagiellonian University School of Medicine, Cracow, Poland. Plasmas were obtained from four asymptomatic men with genetically determined hyperhomocysteinemia stemming from a mutation in the 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase gene (C677T). The presence of factor V Leiden was excluded on the basis of polymerase chain reaction analysis. Blood was drawn after a 16-h overnight fast, and plasma homocysteine concentration was determined according to Mansoor et al. (43Mansoor M.A. Svardal A.M. Ueland P. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 200: 218-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar). l-[35S]Methionine (201 mCi/mmol) was converted tol-[35S]homocysteine thiolactone and subsequently to l-[35S]homocysteine using the method of Baernstein (44Baernstein H.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1934; 106: 451-456Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). The product was identical with authentic homocysteine by thin layer and paper chromatography and contained a small amount (<10%) of homocystine. Reported concentrations ofl-[35S]homocysteine were determined by liquid scintillation counting. Radiolabeled l-homocysteine was added to factor V that had been dialyzed against HBS-Ca2+at room temperature for 2 h. Subsequently, factor V was activated with α-thrombin, and then, upon addition of hirudin and PCPS vesicles, factor Va was inactivated by APC. At designated time points, aliquots were removed from the mixture and subjected to SDS-PAGE. Protein bands were visualized by staining the gel with Coomassie Blue and destaining by diffusion. Gels were then soaked in the fluorography reagent as per the manufacturer's instructions and dried, and radiolabeled protein was detected using Fuji Medical x-ray film (Fuji Medical Systems USA, Inc., Stamford CT). Densitometry was performed on the Coomassie-stained gel before drying and on the resulting autoradiographs as described for immunoblots. Details are given in the legends to figures. Kinetic analyses of [35S]homocysteine modification of factor V were performed in HBS-Ca2+ at room temperature in which times of treatment were varied at a fixed [35S]homocysteine concentration, or concentrations of [35S]homocysteine were varied and the reaction allowed to proceed for a fixed time. Reactions were quenched with iodoacetic acid (Sigma) that had been recrystallized from heptane. Aliquots from reacting mixtures of factor V and [35S]homocysteine were combined with an equal volume of 100 mm iodoacetic acid, 0.5 m Tris, pH 8.7, before the addition of SDS-PAGE sample buffer. The radiolabeled factor V was resolved by electrophoresis on 4–12% linear gradient SDS-polyacrylamide gels under nonreducing conditions, and the gels were processed as described above. Densitometric data from resulting autoradiographs were normalized to correct for variations in protein loading and then converted to the percentage of maximum values using the highest densitometric value within a data set. These transformed data were then fit to a double exponential equation using software IGOR Pro Version 3.1, WaveMetrics Inc. There was no significant alteration in α-thrombin activation of factor V after dialysis against 1 mm homocysteine in HBS-Ca2+for 2 h. Homocystine, homocysteine thiolactone, and cysteine incubated with factor V under the same conditions did not affect activation of factor V by α-thrombin (data not shown). Preincubation of factor V with 1 mmhomocysteine for 2 h inhibited the APC anticoagulant effect toward factor Va (Fig. 1). Factor V was treated with homocysteine at 1 mm, 100 μm, or 30 μm at 4 °C for 2 h, dialyzed against HBS-Ca2+ for an additional 2 h, and then activated by α-thrombin. A progressive decrease in the initial rates of APC inactivation of factor Va, generated from the homocysteine-treated factor V, is associated with increasing homocysteine concentrations (Fig. 1). The rate constant for the APC-catalyzed inactivation of factor Va, generated from factor V treated with 1 mmhomocysteine, is about one-third the rate constant for control experiments (Fig. 1). To test whether the interference was related to a decrease in APC activity after incubation with homocysteine, APC was preincubated with homocysteine at 1 mm for 30, 60, and 120 min at 4 °C. No differences were observed in the rate of inactivation of 100 nm factor Va by 2.5 nm APC whether treated with homocysteine or untreated (data not shown). Contrary to previous reports (23Rodgers G.M. Kane W.H. J. Clin. Invest. 1986; 77: 1909-1916Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar, 25Lentz S.R. Sadler J.E. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 88: 1906-1914Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar), we did not observe a direct effect of homocysteine on APC activity per se. The cleavage at Arg-306 is phospholipid-dependent, whereas the cleavage at Arg-506 is enhanced in the presence of phospholipids (30Kalafatis M. Rand M.D. Mann K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31869-31880Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the absence of phospholipids, the rate of APC inactivation of factor Va derived from factor V treated with 1 mm homocysteine (above) was significantly delayed compared with controls (Fig.2). The ∼3-fold decrease in the rate constant induced by homocysteine is similar to that observed in the presence of phospholipids. Since the lipid-independent inactivation proceeds only through cleavage at Arg-506, the significant impairment of APC inactivation of factor Va without phospholipids indicates that homocysteine must slow cleavage at Arg-506. Factor V (100 nm) was treated with either 1 mmhomocysteine, 1 mm homocystine, or HBS-Ca2+ at 4 °C for 2 h. After activation by α-thrombin (see “Methods”), the factor Va preparations were cleaved by 2.5 nm APC at 37 °C, and the time course of each reaction was followed by Western blot analysis using the monoclonal antibody αFVaHC 17, which recognizes an epitope in the fragment 307–506 (36Katzmann J.A. Nesheim M.E. Hibbard L.S. Mann K.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 162-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), the ultimate APC cleavage product of factor Va heavy chain. Data for this experiment over 60 min are presented in Fig.3. Lanes 1–6 correspond to the control; lanes 13–18 correspond to the homocystine-treated factor V. The samples from treatment with homocysteine are presented in lanes 7–12. In both the control and in the homocystine-treated samples, the 60-min reaction sample (lane 6 and lane 18) show almost complete cleavage of the heavy chain and the appearance of fragments corresponding to the final cleavage product of factor Va. In contrast, some heavy chain remains intact in the homocysteine-treated samples at 60 min (lane 12). The data show that homocysteine inhibits cleavage of factor Va heavy chain by APC and that the reaction requires the reduced form of the amino acid. This effect on inactivation is homocysteine-specific, since for factor V preincubated with 1 mml-cysteine for 2 h, the time course of the inactivation of factor Va by APC was identical to those in control and homocystine experiments (data not shown). Human plasma contains a wide range of the sulfhydryl compounds, including cysteine, cysteinylglycine, homocysteine, and glutathione, which are in the reduced (<5%) or oxidized form or are protein-bound (43Mansoor M.A. Svardal A.M. Ueland P. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 200: 218-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar). Total plasma concentration of cysteine, the most abundant aminothiol, is around 250 μm, with levels of reduced cysteine amounting to 10 μm (43Mansoor M.A. Svardal A.M. Ueland P. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 200: 218-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar). Moreover, it is known that homocysteine binds to numerous plasma proteins, mainly albumin (plasma concentration 0.5–0.7 mm) at an equimolar ratio. To determine whether the addition of homocysteine to normal human plasma would alter the APC sensitivity of factor V subsequently purified from such plasma, human plasma was incubated with homocysteine (10 mm) at 4 °C for 2 h, and then factor V was purified, as described under “Methods.” Homocysteine added to plasma effectively retarded the inactivation of subsequently purified and α-thrombin-activated factor V by APC in the presence of PCPS vesicles (Fig. 4). The ∼3-fold decrease in the rate constant is the same as observed when purified factor V was treated with 1 mm homocysteine (Fig. 1). Slower inactivation of factor Va, derived from factor V purified from plasma treated with homocysteine, was also observed in the absence of phospholipids (data not shown). To determine whether homocysteine can be incorporated into human factor V, factor V was incubated with 450 μm [35S]homocysteine at room temperature for 2 h. It was then activated by α-thrombin, and the resulting factor Va was treated with 6 nm APC in the presence of phospholipids. At selected time points aliquots were removed and subjected to analysis by SDS-PAGE. Coomassie Blue staining of the gel with nonreduced samples (Fig.5 A) displays [35S]homocysteine-treated factor V (lane 1), the derived factor Va (lane 2), and the time course of APC degradation of factor Va (lanes 3–8). Degradation of the heavy chain of factor Va, derived from [35S]homocysteine-treated factor V, is not complete at 180 min (lane 8). In contrast, APC degradation of factor Va, derived from untreated factor V, is complete under these conditions in 60 min (30Kalafatis M. Rand M.D. Mann K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31869-31880Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The APC cleavage of factor Va, derived from [35S]homocysteine-treated factor V, yielded products ofM r = 45,000 (), M r= 30,000 (), and M r = 28/26,000 (). Bands corresponding to the light chain of factor Va are stable throughout the 180-min incubation with APC. This pattern is identical to that seen with untreated factor V (30Kalafatis M. Rand M.D. Mann K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31869-31880Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Comparing the Coomassie Blue-stained (Fig. 5 A) gel with the corresponding autoradiograph (Fig. 5 B) revealed that only the protein fragments that contain free sulfhydryl groups (45Xue J. Kalafatis M. Silveira J.R. Kung C. Mann K.G. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 13109-13116Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 46Xue J. Kalafatis M. Silveira J.R. Kung C. Mann K.G. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 5917-5923Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) (intact factor V (lane 1), the heavy and light chains of factor Va (lane 2), the B region (lanes 2–8), and the doublet of M r = 28/26,000 (lanes 3–8)) incorporate [35S]homocysteine. Consistent with the pattern observed by Coomassie Blue staining, the intensity of the radiolabeled heavy chain band decreased with time, whereas the intensity of the light chain bands remained unchanged. The fragments ofM r = 45,000 () and 30,000 (), which do not contain any free cysteines, are not visualized on the autor"

The FemABX family members are ideal candidates for pathogen-specific antibiotic development. meso-diaminopimelic acid ornithine isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside polymerase chain reaction groups of overlapping clones Antibiotic resistance in pathogenic bacteria is reaching alarming levels as exemplified by the emergence of vancomycin-resistantEnterococci and Staphylococci (1Perl T.M. Am. J. Med. 1999; 106: 48S-52SAbstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 2Neu H.C. Science. 1992; 257: 1064-1073Crossref PubMed Scopus (2373) Google Scholar). This phenomenon is accelerated by the extensive use of broad-spectrum antibiotics, which do not discriminate between targeted pathogens and nontargeted natural flora (2Neu H.C. Science. 1992; 257: 1064-1073Crossref PubMed Scopus (2373) Google Scholar). This situation places critical importance on the identification of new antibiotic targets and the development of new antibiotics. Of particular interest are targets that allow for the development of pathogen-specific antibiotics as pathogen-specific drugs are expected to have both extended clinical lifetimes and increased benefit to risk ratios (3Casadevall A. Clin. Infect. Dis. 1996; 23: 790-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The enzymes that synthesize the interchain peptide of peptidoglycan are intriguing pathogen-specific antibiotic targets because the interchain peptide: (a) is an essential component of the cell wall, (b) requires several enzymatic steps allowing interchain peptide terminators to be developed as antibiotics, (c) is synthesized in only a subset of Gram-positive species where it varies in both length and sequence, and (d) is synthesized in very few Gram-negative species, including the pathogenic spirochetes but excluding the nonpathogenic enterobacteriaceae of the flora (4Ghuysen J.M. Bacteriol. Rev. 1968; 32: 425-464Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The peptidoglycan fraction of the bacterial cell wall contains linear chains of alternating N-acetylglucosamine andN-acetylmuramic acid (see “Disaccharide” in Fig. 1). The N-acetylmuramic acid moieties are linked via a lactyl group to the pentapeptide (l-Ala)-(d-Glu)-X-(d-Ala)-(d-Ala); where X is the diamino acid meso-diaminopimelic acid (Dap),1 Lys, or ornithine (Orn), depending on species. The pentapeptides in neighboring disaccharide chains are cross-linked to each other either directly or via the interchain peptide, depending on the species. In contrast to other nonribosomal peptide synthesis, interchain peptide synthesis proceeds via aminoacyl-tRNA intermediates (5Matsuhashi M. Dietrich C.P. Strominger J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1965; 54: 587-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). It is not known whether the interchain peptide is synthesized directly from aminoacyl-tRNAs or whether the aminoacyl residues are first captured as acyl-enzyme intermediates. The final cross-linking step in cell wall synthesis occurs via a transpeptidation reaction that displaces the terminald-Ala of the pentapeptide (Fig. 1). Transpeptidation is the essential cellular process inhibited by both β-lactam antibiotics and vancomycin (6Walsh C.T. Fisher S.L. Park I.S. Prahalad M. Wu Z. Chem. Biol. 1996; 3: 21-24Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). In addition, the interchain peptide acts as an anchor for the surface proteins that play important roles in adhesion and pathogenicity by interacting with host matrix proteins (7Ton-That H. Labischinski H. Berger-Bachi B. Schneewind O. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29143-29149Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Wild-type Staphylococcus aureus cells synthesize a Gly5 interchain peptide. S. aureus femAmutants and femAB double mutants synthesize the truncated interchain peptides Gly3 and Gly1, respectively (8Berger-Bachi B. Barberis-Maino B.L. Strassle A. Kayser F.H. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1989; 219: 263-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 9de Jonge B.L. Sidow T. Chang Y.S. Labischinski H. Berger-Bachi B. Gage D.A. Tomasz A. J.

A third gene named femX is postulated to be essential for initiation of the interchain peptide. The existence of additional femAB family members beyond bona fide femA and femB in bacterial genomes and femABgenes in species that synthesize only a single residue interchain peptide suggests that FemX might be encoded by a femABhomolog (11Tschierske M. Mori C. Rohrer S. Ehlert K. Shaw K.J. Berger-Bachi B. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1999; 171: 97-102Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Rohrer S. Ehlert K. Labischinski H. Berger-Bachi B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9351-9356Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). One of the extra femAB family members fromS. aureus named fmhB is essential for cell viability, and inhibition of its synthesis results in a drastic accumulation of uncross-linked UDP-MurNAc pentapeptide precursors of peptidoglycan. Those data are consistent with fmhBassignment as femX (13Navarre W.W. Schneewind O. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1999; 63: 174-229Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, to date no enzymatic activity has been demonstrated for FmhB or any other FemAB family member. FemX reactions fall into two classes depending on the enzyme solubility and whether the formation of UDP-MurNAc hexapeptide follows conjugation of UDP-MurNAc pentapeptide to a carrier lipid. In S. aureusand most other characterized species, FemX activity purifies as a large multienzyme “particle” that acts after conjugation of its UDP-MurNAc pentapeptide substrate to the carrier lipid (14Matsuhashi M. Dietrich C.P. Strominger J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1967; 242: 3191-3206Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). This statement follows from the isolation of only UDP-MurNAc pentapeptide from S. aureus cytoplasm, the substrate of FemX reaction (15Stickgold R.A. Neuhaus F.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1967; 242: 1331-1337Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). By contrast, FemX activity in the naturally vancomycin-resistant species Lactobacillus viridescens (ATCC 12706) is a soluble enzyme that acts before conjugation to the carrier lipid (16Plapp R. Strominger J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1970; 245: 3675-3682Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This statement follows from our isolation of UDP-MurNAc hexapeptide from the cytoplasm of L. viridescens, the product of the FemX reaction (see below). Here we report the purification of L. viridescens FemX, identification of thefemX gene, recombinant expression of active FemX, a partial characterization of FemX complex substrate specificity, and a strong stimulator of FemX activity from Escherichia coli. UDP-MurNAc pentapeptides from bacterial cultures were isolated and purified as described previously (15Stickgold R.A. Neuhaus F.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1967; 242: 1331-1337Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with DEAE-Sepharose and Sephadex G-10/Bio-Gel P-2 chromatography being substituted in our purification scheme. UDP-MurNAc hexapeptides, UDP-MurNAc heptapeptides, and UDP-MurNAc octapeptides from L. viridescens cultures were isolated using the same procedures. S. aureus cultures were grown as described previously (15Stickgold R.A. Neuhaus F.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1967; 242: 1331-1337Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Bacillus subtiliscultures were grown in nutrient broth medium at 37 °C to mid-log phase (A 600 = 1.0), vancomycin was added to a concentration of 5 μg/ml, and the flasks were incubated for an additional 3 h. L. viridescens cultures were grown in MRS medium (Difco) at 30 °C to mid-log phase (A 600 = 1.0), vancomycin was added to a concentration of 5 μg/ml, and the flasks were incubated for an additional 3 h. Borrelia burgdorferi cultures were grown in BSK-H medium (Sigma) at 30 °C in tightly capped bottles under mild agitation (40 rpm). Vancomycin was added to a final concentration of 0.4 μg/ml after 84 h, and incubation was continued for 48 h. An additional aliquot of vancomycin (0.4 μg/ml) was added and incubated for 24 h. E. coli cultures containing thefemX gene (pQE-12) were grown in LB medium. FemX expression was induced by the addition of 25 μm IPTG when theA 600 reached 0.6 followed by incubation for an additional 3 h. Mass analysis of UDP-MurNAc peptides and larger species isolated from bacteria and FemX reaction products were carried out using a Finnigan LCQ mass spectrometer in a negative ion mode. FemX activities were assayed by monitoring the incorporation of [14C]Ala into purified UDP-MurNAc pentapeptides. FemX assays were carried out according to Plapp and Strominger (16Plapp R. Strominger J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1970; 245: 3675-3682Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Fifty-microliter assay mixtures contained 30 μm UDP-MurNAc pentapeptide, 500 μm ATP, 50 μg of E. coli tRNA (Sigma), 18 μm [14C]Ala (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), 500 units E. coli aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase (Sigma), 2 μl of appropriately diluted FemX in 50 mm Tris buffer, pH 7.6, 20 mm MgCl2, and 50 mm NaCl. FemX reactions were incubated at room temperature for 30 min and stopped by the addition of 1 μl of 2.0 n NaOH. 3 μl of each reaction mixture was spotted onto precoated cellulose TLC plates (Selecto Scientific) and fractionated using ethanol:1 m ammonium acetate (7.5:3 v/v) as the solvent. Spots were visualized by autoradiography, excised, and quantitated by counting in liquid scintillation fluid. One unit of enzyme activity is defined as the amount of the protein that catalyzes the incorporation of 1 nmol of [14C]Ala into UDP-MurNAc pentapeptide per min under standard assay conditions. FemA assays were carried out as described above but used UDP-MurNAc hexapeptides isolated from L. viridescens as the acceptor substrate (see above). L. viridescens cells were grown to late logarithmic phase (A 600 = 1.7) in MRS medium (Difco) at 30 °C, harvested by centrifugation, and washed once with 50 mm Tris buffer, pH 7.8. All purification steps were carried out in 50 mm Tris buffer, pH 7.8, at 4 °C. Cells were lysed by grinding with alumina (16Plapp R. Strominger J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1970; 245: 3675-3682Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the supernatant was fractionated by ammonium sulfate precipitation (45–90% saturation), DEAE-Sephacryl chromatography (bound FemX activity was eluted with 0–0.5 m KCl gradient), and Sephadex G-75 chromatography. The FemX-containing fraction was further fractionated by fast protein liquid chromatography on Mono-Q (eluted with 0–1 m KCl gradient), phenyl-Sepharose (eluted with 1.7–0 m ammonium sulfate gradient), and Superose-12 columns to yield a single polypeptide as visualized by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The final yield from 20 g of wet cells was ∼150 μg of protein. Purified FemX was digested with trypsin (1:50, w/w, 37 °C, 24 h), and the tryptic peptides were separated by reverse phase high pressure liquid chromatography on a C18 column (Vydac, 1 × 150 mm) using a linear gradient of acetonitrile (0–100% in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid) at a flow rate of 150 μl/min over 45 min. Native FemX and two of its tryptic peptides were subjected to automated Edman degradation to obtain NH2-terminal (N) and internal peptide (IP) sequence information: N = PVLNLNDPQAVERYEEFMRQSPY, IP1 = TTLDLYPQK, and IP2 = EYIGEIDKVLDPEVYAEL. None of these peptides had significant matches in available sequence data bases or with any of the known FemAB family members. Degenerate deoxyoligonucleotide primers were synthesized based on the NH2-terminal peptide and the two internal peptides. PCR using these primers amplified regions ofL. viridescens genomic DNA to generate products of ∼450 and 950 base pairs, respectively. The larger of these fragments was cloned and sequenced. This fragment of FemX was enzymatically active when expressed with COOH-terminal His6 tag. To complete the sequence of femX from L. viridescens, inside-out PCR was employed (PCR away from the center of the gene using small circles of genomic DNA as the template). Genomic DNA templates were prepared using the following procedure. L. viridescensgenomic DNA (40 μg) was digested with Sau3A (0.5 unit) for 30 min and fractionated on an 0.8% agarose gel. DNA fragments in the range of 2–4 kilobase pairs were extracted from the gel, circularized (self-ligated in 250 μl), recovered in 25 μl by ethanol precipitation, and used as templates for PCR. Based on the completed FemX sequence, deoxyoligonucleotide primers were designed to express FemX bearing an NH2-terminal His6 affinity tag (BamHI fragment for expression in pQE8, Qiagen), a COOH-terminal His6 affinity tag (EcoRI/BamHI fragment for expression in pQE12, Qiagen), and without an affinity tag (EcoRI/BamHI fragment in pQE12). Primers for expression of COOH-terminal His6-tagged FemX in pQE12 were: LFQ12N = CCCGCTGAATTCATTAAAGAGGAGAAATTAACTATGCCAGTGTTAAATT and LFCH6 = CCCGCTGGATCCATCTTTAACTAATTC. Primers for expression of wild type FemX in pQE12 were: LFQ12N = CCCGCTGAATTCATTAAAGAGGAGAAATTAACTATGCCAGTGTTAAATT and LFCH6 = CCCGCTGGATCCTTAATCTTTAACTAATTC. Primers for expression of NH2-terminal His6-tagged FemX in pQE8 were: LvQ8N = CCCGCTGGA-TCCATGCCAGTGTTAAATTTG and LvQ8C = CCCGCTGGATCCATCTTTAACTAATTC. All primers are written from their 5′-3′ ends. FmhB (GenBankTM accession number AF106850) was expressed bearing an NH2-terminal His6 affinity tag (BglII fragment for expression in pQE8), a COOH-terminal His6 affinity tag (EcoRI/BglII fragment for expression in pQE12), and without any modifications (EcoRI/BglII fragment for expression in pQE12). Three FemAB homologs from Streptococcus pyogenes, 254–1, 297–2, and 297–3, were expressed with NH2-terminal His6 affinity tags (BamHI fragments for expression in pQE8; numbers refer to current contigs as the sequencing of the S. pyogenes genome is in progress). All clones were transformed into E. coli strain DH5α containing pREP4 (Qiagen). Recombinant proteins bearing His6 affinity tags were purified using immobilized metal affinity chromatography using nickel-nitriloacetic acid agarose according to the manufacturer's instructions (Qiagen). Purified enzymes and lysates were assayed for FemX activity as described above. Site-directed mutagenesis was carried out using the Quick Change site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Deoxyoligonucleotide synthesis and other procedures were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. COOH-terminal His6-tagged mutants were purified using immobilized metal affinity chromatography that used nickel-nitriloacetic acid agarose as described above. Cultures of E. coli strain DH5α were grown to anA 600 of 1.5, and the cells were lysed by sonication. Cell lysate in 50 mm Tris buffer, pH 7.6, was adsorbed onto DEAE-Sephacel and washed with 0.15 m NaCl. The stimulating activity was eluted with 0.25 m NaCl. The stimulating activity was further fractionated on phenyl-Sepharose in the above buffer containing 1.7 m ammonium sulfate. Stimulating activity was eluted with 0.6–0.4 m ammonium sulfate and concentrated. Finally, the stimulating activity was fractionated on Sephacryl S-200 where it eluted in the void volume. We purified FemX from L. viridescens and cloned its encoding femXgene using reverse genetics. Data base searches identifiedfemX (GenBankTM accession number AY008262) as a member of the femAB gene family, now called thefemABX family (Fig. 2). ThefemABX family shows no homology to the leucine/phenylalanine transferase family; the only other known example of a bacterial enzyme that synthesizes a peptide bond using an aminoacyl-tRNA substrate (17Ichetovkin I.E. Abramochkin G. Shrader T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 33009-33014Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Sequence data upstream and downstream of the femX coding region (3–500 base pairs each way) revealed that femX is not a part of an operon. Recombinant expression of FemX yielded a soluble enzyme that initiated synthesis of an interchain peptide in vitro (Fig.3 A). Recombinant FemX had a molecular mass of 39,360, which is in agreement with the mass deduced from the femX gene. The specific activities of the His6-tagged and native enzymes were compared and are equivalent. Purified FemX was soluble to >15 mg/ml, and gel filtration chromatography suggested that the enzyme is a monomer.Figure 3A, ESI mass spectrum of a FemX reaction carried out with a mixture of alanine-, serine-, and glycine-tRNAs. Relevant masses are: UDP-MurNAc pentapeptide = 1149; UDP-MurNAc hexapeptide (glycine addition) = 1206; UDP-MurNAc hexapeptide (alanine addition) = 1220; UDP-MurNAc hexapeptide (serine addition) = 1236.

Thefirst bar corresponds to assays lacking aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase additions (background).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Incubation of FemX with UDP-MurNAc pentapeptide resulted in approximately equal rates of transfer of alanine and serine from their corresponding E. coli tRNAs to UDP-MurNAc pentapeptides containing lysine in their X position (see Fig. 1). Glycine was also transferred but at a much lower rate (Fig.3 A). Assays with mixtures of alanine-, serine-, and glycine-tRNAs resulted in mixtures of the expected UDP-MurNAc hexapeptides but no larger species (Fig. 3 A). We conclude that FemX adds only the first residue of the interchain peptide. By contrast, recombinant expression of neither S. aureus FmhB nor any of the FemABX family members from the S. pyogenesshowed FemX or FemA activity. Each inactive FemABX enzyme was readily overexpressed and purified from E. coli and showed a CD spectrum characteristic of a folded protein. These data suggest that FemX enzymes that purify as large multiprotein complexes require additional factors or lipid conjugation for their activity. Partial inhibition of S. aureus with vancomycin or β-lactams results in the accumulation of only UDP-MurNAc pentapeptides in the cytoplasmic precursor pools of these cells, the substrates of FemX reaction (15Stickgold R.A. Neuhaus F.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1967; 242: 1331-1337Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Those data form the basis for the statement that FemX from S. aureus acts after conjugation of UDP-MurNAc pentapeptide to the carrier lipid (15Stickgold R.A. Neuhaus F.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1967; 242: 1331-1337Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). By contrast, partial inhibition of L. viridescens with vancomycin resulted in the accumulation of UDP-MurNAc pentapeptides conjugated in equal proportions to alanine, alanine-serine, and Ala-Ser-Ala as indicated by mass analysis of cytoplasmic precursor pools (mass numbers 1221, 1309, and 1380, respectively). These species are the expected products of FemX and FemX + FemAB reactions (see Fig.1). No UDP-MurNAc pentapeptides were detected by mass analyses of L. viridescens cytoplasmic precursor pools. In addition, the UDP-MurNAc peptide mixtures isolated from L. viridescenswere not substrates for the FemX reaction, confirming that no UDP-MurNAc pentapeptides were contained in these mixtures. Importantly, these same precursors were detected in similar proportions in the absence of vancomycin, although at much lower absolute concentrations. Those data reveal that the FemX enzyme from L. viridescensacts on UDP-MurNAc pentapeptides before the conjugation of this intermediate to a lipid precursor. Interestingly, no UDP-MurNAc hexapeptide conjugated to serine was detected in the cytoplasmic precursor pools in L. viridescens by mass analysis, either in the presence or absence of vancomycin. The ability of purified recombinant FemX to make this product in vitro (see above) remains unexplained. E. coli cells tolerated the expression of FemX at high levels. This lack of an observed phenotype for E. coli cells expressing FemX suggested that UDP-MurNAc pentapeptides containing Dap in theX position were not substrates for FemX because modification of UDP-MurNAc pentapeptide pools in E. coli is expected to be highly deleterious (see Fig. 1 for details). These statements follow from experiments demonstrating that: (a) the expression ofmurE from S. aureus in E. coli cells resulted in the substitution of lysine for Dap at the Xposition in <50% of E. coli pentapeptides (18Mengin-Lecreulx D. Falla T. Blanot D. van Heijenoort J. Adams D.J. Chopra I.D. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 5909-5914Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); and (b) this relatively minor substitution blocked the transpeptidation reaction and arrested cell growth (18Mengin-Lecreulx D. Falla T. Blanot D. van Heijenoort J. Adams D.J. Chopra I.D. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 5909-5914Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This suggestion that Dap in the X position abolished recognition by FemX was confirmed directly. No UDP-MurNAc hexapeptides were detected in the isolated cytoplasmic precursor pools of E. coli strains overexpressing FemX. In addition, isolated UDP-MurNAc pentapeptide containing Dap in the X position (isolated fromB. subtilis, see Fig. 1) was not a substrate for the FemX reaction (Fig. 3 B). By contrast, UDP-MurNAc pentapeptide containing Orn in the X position (isolated from B. burgdorferi) was a substrate for the FemX reaction (Fig.3 B). Isolated pentapeptides with lysine in the Xposition were neither substrates nor inhibitors for the FemX reaction in the presence or absence of UDP and/or MurNAc. These data suggest (a) the deletion of a single methylene group from the side chain of lysine does not abolish recognition by FemX, but the addition of an acid group to lysine does and (b) there is a requirement of an intact UDP-MurNAc pentapeptide bond geometry for recognition by FemX. Overall, the FemABX family is poorly conserved, and FemX is less than 20% similar to other known FemABX family members (Fig. 2). This low level of sequence conservation is noteworthy in light of the fact that each family member recognizes two large and relatively conserved substrates, an aminoacyl-tRNA and a UDP-MurNAc pentapeptide. Sequence alignments of FemABX family members revealed that the only conserved region greater than a single residue is the sequence Phe-305–Lys-306 (Fig. 2). However, mutagenesis experiments identified Gln-29 as the only conserved and potentially catalytic residue that was essential for FemX activity (TableI). Mutation of the conserved nonpolar residues proline 110 and glycine 292 also resulted in inactive enzyme despite normal yields of recombinant protein (Table I). Those data reveal that there are no absolutely conserved residues that might form acyl-enzyme intermediates in the FemABX family and identifies the FemABX family members as novel nonribosomal peptidyltransferases. The higher FemX activity of mutants F305Y and Y216F, relative to F305L and Y216L, is consistent with the participation of these conserved aromatic residues in an aromatic-aromatic interaction with aminoacyl-tRNA substrates. Despite the low level sequence conservation within the family, the COOH-terminal region of FemX is important for function as truncation by more than 10 residues at this end of the enzyme abolished its activity (data not shown).Table ISpecific activity of FemX mutant enzymesFemXActivityFemXActivity%%Wild type100P110LNDQ29ENDP110HNDQ29TNDP110FNDY73F40F196L26Y73L40F196Y87Q144E11G292VNDQ144T79F305Y98Y216F41F305L16Y216LNDG319V5K306R25G319S13K306C38K306A8K306N9Data are percent activity of wild-type FemX.

Open table in a new tab Data are percent activity of wild-type FemX. All assays were carried out as described under “Experimental Procedures” and contained 0.2 μg of fractionated E. coli lysate as stimulator. ND, not detected (<2% of wild-type activity). Purified FemX was stimulated byE. coli cell lysate 4–8-fold (Fig.4). Fractionation of E. colilysate revealed that the stimulating activity is a protein or a complex of proteins with a molecular mass > 200,000 daltons. Control experiments were performed to further characterize the stimulating activity. The stimulating activity lacked aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase activity. The stimulating activity is not an ATP-dependent protease because FemX was not processed or degraded during assays (assayed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis). The stimulating activity is not the GroESL molecular chaperone because co-overexpression of the GroESL chaperone (17Ichetovkin I.E. Abramochkin G. Shrader T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 33009-33014Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) did not increase the specific activity of FemX from E. coli lysates or the resultant purified FemX. The stimulating activity was not tRNA based on the purification scheme, the spectrum of stimulator (A 260/280 = 0.6), and tRNA addition experiments. Stimulation was not because of general molecular crowding effects because stimulation was not observed for other and more concentratedE. coli lysate fractions. Our working model is that the stimulating activity is a UDP-MurNAc pentapeptide binding complex that presents this substrate in an optimal conformation to FemX. This statement follows from: (a) the existence of the stimulator in E. coli, a species lacking FemX, and (b) data demonstrating that each of the FemX mutants in Table I were stimulated ∼4-fold by fractionated E. coli lysate. This work identifies the members of the FemABX family as nonribosomal peptidyltransferases. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of a specific enzymatic activity for the members of the FemABX family and identifies the members of this family as targets for pathogen-specific antibiotic development.

After maturation by culturing in medium containing 26 mmpotassium (high K+), changing to medium containing 5 mm potassium (low K+; LK) rapidly induces neuronal apoptosis. Then over 50% of granule cells die within 24 h. However, the molecular mechanisms by which the LK-induced apoptosis occurs in cultured cerebellar granule cells remain unclear.

In the developing nervous system, about half of all neurons that are produced die by apoptosis around the time of birth (1Oppenheim R.W. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1991; 14: 453-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (2754) Google Scholar). Cultured rat cerebellar granule cells are widely used as a model system for studying neuronal apoptosis. These neurons are usually cultured and matured in medium containing 26 mm potassium (high K+; HK).1 After maturation, changing to medium containing 5 mm potassium (low K+; LK) induces neuronal cell death in which the cells show apoptotic features. In addition, this culture system provides a large homogeneous neuronal population. Therefore, these neurons are widely used as a primary cell culture system to investigate the biochemical and molecular mechanisms underlying neuronal apoptosis in the central nervous system. Mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases are serine/threonine kinases that play an important role in signal transduction from the cell surface to the nucleus. The mammalian MAP kinases can be subdivided into extracellular signal-regulated kinases, c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNK), and p38 MAP kinases (p38). p38 is activated by phosphorylation on Thr-180 and Tyr-182 in response to environmental stress (2Treisman R. Curr. Opin. Cell. Biol. 1996; 8: 205-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (1160) Google Scholar, 3Robinson M.J. Cobb M.H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 180-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (2278) Google Scholar). Recently, p38 activation has been suggested to be involved in mediating apoptosis in various cell types (4Kummer J.L. Rao P.K. Heidenreich K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20490-20494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar, 5Horstmann S. Kahle P.J. Borasio G.D. J. Neurosci.

SB203580, a specific inhibitor of p38, prevents several types of cell death, including glutamate-induced apoptosis of cultured cerebellar granule neurons (7Kawasaki H. Morooka T. Shimohama S.

Neurosci. 2000; 20: 5037-5044Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). c-Jun is a member of the activator protein-1 family of transcription factors possessing leucine zippers. c-Jun is phosphorylated on Ser-63 and Ser-73 within its N-terminal region by JNK (9Hibi M. Lin A. Smeal T. Minden A. Karin M. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2135-2148Crossref PubMed Scopus (1708) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of c-Jun is necessary for apoptosis of superior cervical ganglion and cerebellar granule neurons (10Ham J. Babij C. Whitfield J. Pfarr C.M. Lallemand D. Yaniv M. Rubin L.L. Neuron. 1995; 14: 927-939Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (757) Google Scholar, 11Watson A. Eilers A. Lallemand D. Kyriakis J. Rubin L.L. Ham J. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 751-762Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the mechanism of c-Jun phosphorylation remains unclear. In the present study, we investigated whether p38 is necessary for LK-induced apoptosis and whether p38 is involved in the phosphorylation of c-Jun in cerebellar granule neurons. Our results suggest that p38 was activated after lowering potassium concentration, and active p38 phosphorylates c-Jun directly. We found the p38-c-Jun pathway is very important for LK-induced apoptosis in cerebellar granule neurons. Primary cultures of dissociated cerebellar granule neurons were prepared from the cerebella of postnatal day 9 rats (Wistar ST, both sexes) as described previously (12Levi G. Aloisi F. Ciotti M.T. Gallo V. Brain Res. 1984; 290: 77-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar, 13Hatanaka H. Tsukui H. Nihonmatsu I.

Briefly, cells were gently dissociated with a plastic pipette after digestion with papain (90 units/ml, Worthington) at 37 °C. The cells were then cultured in medium consisting of 5% precolostrum newborn calf serum (Mitsubishi Kasei), 5% heat-inactivated horse serum (55 °C, 30 min; Life Technologies, Inc.), and 90% 1:1 mixture of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and Ham's F-12 medium containing 15 mmHEPES buffer (pH 7.4), 30 nm selenium, and 1.9 mg/ml sodium bicarbonate, at a final cell density of 5 × 105cells/cm2 on a polyethyleneimine-coated surface in 6-cm-diameter dishes (21 cm2 of culture surface area, Sumitomo Bakelite). After culture for 1 day in a humidified CO2 (5%) incubator, the medium was changed to 26 mm potassium-containing (HK) minimum essential medium (MEM) supplemented with 5% heat-inactivated horse serum and 1 μm cytosine arabinoside. MEM was supplemented with 2.2 mg/ml glucose and 2.2 mg/ml sodium bicarbonate. HK-MEM was prepared by increasing the KHCO3 concentration from the normal low value of 5.4 to 26 mm, with the omission of the corresponding concentration NaHCO3. After 4 days in culture in a 10% CO2 incubator, the medium was changed to serum-free 5.4 mm potassium-containing (LK) MEM or HK-MEM. The assays described below were then performed. Neuronal survival was determined by MTT assay, according to the original procedure (17Mosmann T. J. Immunol. Methods. 1983; 65: 55-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (45846) Google Scholar) with some modifications (18Hansen M.B. Nielsen S.E. Berg K. J. Immunol. Methods. 1989; 119: 203-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (3329) Google Scholar). Briefly, the tetrazolium salt MTT (3-(4,5-dimethyl-2-thizolyl)-2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide) was added to cultures to a final concentration of 1 mg/ml. After incubation for 2 h at 37 °C, the assay was stopped by adding 80% volume of lysis buffer (10% SDS in 50%N,N-dimethyl formamide, pH 4.7). The absorbance was measured spectrophotometrically at 570 nm, following overnight incubation at 37 °C. The percent survival was defined as (A(experimental − blank)/A(control − blank)) × 100; the blank value was taken from wells without cells. To stain neurons, the cultured cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min and incubated with anti-MAP2 antiserum (1:1000; a gift from Dr. H. Murofushi) overnight at 4 °C. Cells were visualized with a Vectastain ABC kit (Vector Laboratories), followed by exposure to 0.02% 3–3′-diaminobenzidine 4-HCl, 0.3% H2O2 and 0.1% (NH4)2Ni(SO4)2. Cells were lysed in SDS lysis buffer containing 1% SDS, 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 5 mm EDTA (pH 8.0), 10 mm NaF, 2 mmNa3VO4, 0.5 mm phenylarsine oxide, 10 mm Na4P2O4, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The lysates were boiled for 3 min and then clarified by ultracentrifugation at 60,000 ×g at 8 °C for 30 min. The protein concentration was determined using a BCA protein assay kit (Pierce), and then aliquots of 10 μg of protein were resolved by electrophoresis on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Proteins were transferred onto polyvinylidene fluoride membranes (Millipore Corp.) in 0.1 m Tris base, 0.192 m glycine, and 20% methanol using a semi-dry electrophoretic transfer system. The membranes were blocked with 0.1% Tween 20, Tris-buffered saline (T-TBS) containing 5% nonfat dried milk at room temperature for 1 h. Membranes were probed with 1:200 anti-phospho-JNK antibody, 1:200 anti-JNK antibody, 1:200 anti-phospho-p38 antibody, 1:1000 anti-p38 antibody, 1:200 anti-phospho-c-Jun antibody, or 1:1000 anti-c-Jun antibody in T-TBS containing 1 or 5% nonfat dried milk at room temperature for 1 h. After washing three times with T-TBS, the membranes were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG or donkey anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody (Zymed Laboratories Inc. or Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc.) diluted 1:1000 with T-TBS at room temperature for 1 h. The membranes were then washed at least 4 times with T-TBS and were visualized using the ECL chemiluminescence system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) or Immunostar (Wako). The cell lysates were prepared at 0, 3, 6, and 9 h after changing to LK medium using Triton lysis buffer containing 1% Triton X-100, 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA (pH 8.0), 10 mm NaF, 2 mm Na3VO4, 0.5 mm phenylarsine oxide, 10 mmNa4P2O4, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Then 1 μg of anti-p38 antibody was added to the lysates followed by incubation at 4 °C for at least 3 h. Protein G-Sepharose (10-μl gel) was then added and rotated at 4 °C for 1 h. The immune complexes were pelleted by centrifugation at 10,000 × g at 4 °C for 1 min and then washed twice with Triton lysis buffer and twice with kinase buffer containing 40 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 10 mmMgCl2, 3 mm MnCl2. p38 kinase reaction was carried out for 20 min at 25 °C with 5 μg of GST-ATF2 (rat, residues 1–109) or GST-c-Jun (human, residues 1–125) as a substrate and the immunoprecipitate in kinase buffer containing 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, 20 μm ATP. After SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, the incorporation of32P into GST-ATF2-(1–109) or GST-c-Jun-(1–125) was visualized using a Fuji BAS2000 image analyzer. Anti-MAP2 antibody was kindly provided by Dr. H. Murofushi. Anti-phospho-p38, anti-phospho-JNK, and anti-JNK antibodies were purchased from New England Biolabs Inc., and anti-p38, anti-phospho-c-Jun and anti-c-Jun antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc. SB203580 was obtained from Calbiochem and dissolved at 10 mm in dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO) as a stock solution. We utilized primary cultures of cerebellar granule cells from neonatal rats as a model system to investigate the intracellular signaling in LK-induced cell death. This cell death shows characteristic features of apoptosis (14Kubo T. Nonomura T. Enokido Y. Hatanaka H. Dev. Brain Res. 1995; 85: 249-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 15Shimoke K. Kubo T. Numakawa T. Abiru Y. Enokido Y. Takei N. Ikeuchi T. Hatanaka H. Dev. Brain Res. 1997; 101: 197-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). After maturation for 4 days in HK medium, the medium was switched to serum-free LK medium. At 24 h after reduction of potassium concentration, cells were stained with anti-MAP2 antibody (Fig. 1 A), and cell survival was determined by MTT assay (Fig. 1 B). As a result, 51.7% of granule neurons died in LK medium. Previous studies showed that the level of c-Jun expression was increased, and the N-terminal phosphorylation of c-Jun was necessary for the process of apoptosis (11Watson A. Eilers A. Lallemand D. Kyriakis J. Rubin L.L. Ham J. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 751-762Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Miller T.M. Johnson E.M.J. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 7487-7495Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we performed Western blotting analysis with monoclonal anti-phosphorylated c-Jun (Ser-63) antibody to detect the phosphorylation of c-Jun (Fig.2 A). Three hours after changing to LK medium, the level of c-Jun phosphorylation was increased, and this phosphorylation was maintained for 12 h. This phosphorylated and activated c-Jun may form homo- or heterodimers with c-Fos, and the dimerized c-Jun may up-regulate the expression of c-Jun itself. The c-Jun up-regulation is known to be important in DNA damage-induced apoptosis (20Araki T. Enokido Y. Inamura N. Aizawa S. Reed J.C. Hatanaka H. Brain Res. 1998; 794: 239-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) and apoptosis induced by the PI3-K inhibitor, LY294002, in cerebellar granule cells (21Shimoke K. Yamagishi S. Yamada M. Ikeuchi T. Hatanaka H. Dev. Brain Res. 1999; 112: 245-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined the level of c-Jun protein during LK-induced cell death using a polyclonal anti-c-Jun antibody (Fig. 2 B). Our results indicated that the expression of c-Jun was markedly increased from 6 to 12 h after potassium deprivation. The delay in the changes in the protein level compared with the phosphorylation of c-Jun was considered to be due to the period required for transcription and translation of c-Jun. In contrast, the phosphorylation and protein levels of c-Jun in serum-free HK-MEM were not changed from basal level. Next we investigated what kind of kinase phosphorylates c-Jun in cerebellar granule neurons. The first candidate was c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) that belongs to the MAP kinase superfamily and is activated by phosphorylation on Thr-183 and Tyr-185. JNK activation is known to participate in apoptosis of brain neurons and PC12 cells (22Xia Z. Dickens M. Raingeaud J. Davis R.J. Greenberg M.E.

Res. 2000; 60: 450-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). We examined whether JNK was activated to phosphorylate c-Jun during LK-induced apoptosis. To examine JNK activation, the lysates from granule cells cultured for 0, 3, 6, 9, and 12 h in serum-free LK or HK medium after maturation were immunoblotted with anti-phospho-JNK (Fig.3 A). We could not detect any increase in the JNK phosphorylation after lowering potassium concentration. This result suggested that JNK is not involved in c-Jun phosphorylation during LK-induced apoptosis of granule cells, consistent with the observations of Watson et al. (11Watson A. Eilers A. Lallemand D. Kyriakis J. Rubin L.L. Ham J. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 751-762Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The next candidate was p38, which also belongs to the MAP kinase superfamily. To examine whether p38 was activated during potassium deprivation-induced apoptosis, lysates from granule cells cultured for 0, 3, 6, 9, and 12 h in serum-free LK or HK medium were immunoblotted with anti-phospho-p38 antibody (Fig. 3 B). p38 was markedly phosphorylated within 3 h, and the increased level of phosphorylation was prolonged to 9 h after potassium deprivation. To confirm this observation, we further performed in vitro kinase assay of p38 (Fig. 3 C). p38 was immunoprecipitated from the lysates with anti-p38 antibody, and the p38 kinase assay was carried out with [γ-32P]ATP using GST-ATF2-(1–109) as a substrate. ATF2 was markedly phosphorylated by p38 3 h after potassium deprivation. These results indicated that p38 is indeed activated during LK-induced cell death. It is an intriguing question whether p38 phosphorylates c-Jun. As shown in Figs.2 A and 3 B, the time courses of phosphorylation of p38 and c-Jun were very similar. To examine whether p38 is involved in the regulation of c-Jun, we investigated the effects of SB203580, a specific inhibitor of p38, on the phosphorylation and expression of c-Jun. The addition of SB203580 to LK medium markedly suppressed the phosphorylation and up-regulation of c-Jun in a dose-dependent manner (Fig.4 A). Next, we examined whether p38 directly phosphorylated c-Jun using in vitro kinase assay. After immunoprecipitation with anti-p38 antibody, the p38 kinase assay was carried out with [γ-32P]ATP, using GST-c-Jun-(1–125) as the substrate. At 3 h after potassium deprivation, c-Jun was phosphorylated by p38 (Fig. 4 B). These results suggested that p38 directly phosphorylates c-Jun during LK-induced apoptosis of granule cells. To examine whether the activation of p38 is involved in the process of LK-induced apoptosis, we utilized SB203580, an inhibitor of p38. When apoptosis was induced by lowering the potassium concentration, the inhibitor was added to LK medium (Fig. 5). After 24 h, cell survival was quantified by counting the number of MAP2-positive cells. Resultingly SB203580 inhibited neuronal apoptosis. In the presence of 3, 10, and 30 μm SB203580, 59, 74, and 81% of cells survived, respectively. This result indicated that p38 is involved in the signaling pathway of LK-induced apoptosis. Several recent studies have suggested that p38 is required for some apoptotic processes (5Horstmann S. Kahle P.J. Borasio G.D. J. Neurosci. Res. 1998; 52: 483-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 6Behrens M.M. Strasser U. Koh J.Y. Gwag B.J. Choi D.W. Neuroscience. 1999; 94: 917-927Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). For example, during glutamate-evoked apoptosis of cerebellar granule neurons, p38 was transiently activated, and this apoptosis was prevented by SB203580 (7Kawasaki H. Morooka T. Shimohama S. Kimura J. Hirano T. Gotoh Y. Nishida E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18518-18521Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). However, function of p38 in apoptotic process remains unclear. In this study, we investigated the role of p38 in LK-induced apoptosis of cultured cerebellar granule neurons. Our results indicated that p38 was phosphorylated and activated during LK-induced apoptosis (Fig. 3,B and C). In Fig. 3 B, control neurons in HK medium also showed a transient and slight activation of p38. The transient activation of p38 was considered to be due to changing from serum-containing to serum-free HK-MEM. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) are known to rescue granule neurons from LK-induced apoptosis (14Kubo T. Nonomura T. Enokido Y. Hatanaka H. Dev. Brain Res. 1995; 85: 249-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 26D'Mello S.R. Galli C. Ciotti T. Calissano P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Neuroscience. 2000; 95: 473-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). We observed that BDNF and IGF-1 rescued about 60 and 80%, respectively, of neurons from cell death (data not shown). Furthermore, the addition of BDNF and IGF-1 to LK medium suppressed the activation of p38 similarly to control neurons in HK medium (data not shown). The mRNA and protein levels of c-Jun were selectively increased after NGF withdrawal in sympathetic neurons (10Ham J. Babij C. Whitfield J. Pfarr C.M. Lallemand D. Yaniv M. Rubin L.L. Neuron. 1995; 14: 927-939Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (757) Google Scholar, 28Estus S. Zaks W.J. Freeman R.S. Gruda M. Bravo R. Johnson E.M.J. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1717-1727Crossref PubMed Scopus (786) Google Scholar). In cerebellar granule neurons, Watson et al. (11Watson A. Eilers A. Lallemand D. Kyriakis J. Rubin L.L. Ham J. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 751-762Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) showed that dominant negative c-JunAla, which cannot be phosphorylated, inhibited LK-induced apoptosis. We observed marked changes in the levels of phosphorylation and expression of c-Jun during this apoptotic process. Although the importance of c-Jun is well known, its kinase has remained unclear. The first candidate was JNK, because the phosphorylation of c-Jun by JNK was well known in sympathetic neurons (29Eilers A. Whitfield J. Babij C. Rubin L.L. Ham J. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 1713-1724Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, in cerebellar granule neurons, the JNK activity was high under basal conditions and was not activated further during apoptosis. The next candidate was p38, because the time courses of the phosphorylation of p38 and c-Jun during apoptosis were very similar. To investigate the role of p38 in the phosphorylation of c-Jun, we utilized SB203580. The addition of this inhibitor completely prevented both phosphorylation and up-regulation of c-Jun (Fig. 4 A). In addition, in vitro kinase assay of p38 showed that p38 could directly phosphorylate c-Jun (Fig. 4 B). Furthermore, we found that SB203580 prevented LK-induced apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 5). This prevention of apoptosis seemed to be due to the inhibition of phosphorylation of c-Jun. It has been reported that SB203580 can block some JNKs at high doses (30Clerk A. Sugden P.H. FEBS Lett. 1998; 426: 93-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 31Whitmarsh A.J. Yang S.-H.

Pharmacol. 1999; 79: 369-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Since we could not detect low potassium-induced activation of JNKs, its contribution to the present findings is likely to be limited but warrants further investigation. SB202190 is also utilized as a specific inhibitor of p38 (33Lee J.C. Laydon J.T. McDonnell P.C. Gallagher T.F. Kumar S. Green D. McNulty D. Blumenthal M.J. Heys J.R. Landvatter S.W. Nature. 1994; 372: 739-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (3128) Google Scholar). We observed a weak but significant inhibitory effect of SB202190 on the apoptosis (data not shown). ATF2 is a member of the ATF/CREB family of basic region leucine zipper (bZIP) DNA-binding proteins. The N-terminal transactivation domain of ATF2 is phosphorylated by both p38 and JNK (34Gupta S. Campbell D. Derijard B. Davis R.J. Science. 1995; 267: 389-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (1336) Google Scholar, 35van Dam H. Wilhelm D. Herr I. Steffen A. Herrlich P. Angel P.

Therefore, we investigated whether ATF2 was also phosphorylated by p38 during LK-induced apoptosis. The phosphorylation of ATF2 was detected by Western blotting analysis using anti-phospho-ATF2 antibody. ATF2 was markedly phosphorylated at 3 h (data not shown). The time course of ATF2 phosphorylation corresponded to those of phosphorylation of p38 and c-Jun. These observations suggested that p38 is involved in phosphorylation of not only c-Jun but also of ATF2. We observed that p38 showed greater affinity for ATF2 than c-Jun as a substrate in the kinase assay utilizing the same amounts of GST-ATF2 and GST-c-Jun (data not shown). In addition, we investigated whether SB203580 inhibited phosphorylation of ATF2 as well as that of c-Jun. SB203580 indeed inhibited ATF2 phosphorylation (data not shown). This result confirmed that SB203580 suppresses the p38 pathway. The results presented here demonstrate that p38 can directly phosphorylate c-Jun during LK-induced apoptosis in cultured cerebellar granule neurons. However, the mechanisms of c-Jun-mediated apoptosis remain unclear. Therefore, further studies should be performed to identify c-jun target genes and to determine how c-Jun regulates apoptosis.

Here, we attempt to identify the nature of the nucleotidases. Earlier, we constructed various mammalian cell lines that can be induced to overproduce the high Km 5′-nucleotidase (hkm-NT) or the 5′(3′)-deoxynucleotidase (dNT-1). Now we labeled control and induced human 293 cells and hamster V79 cells with radioactive hypoxanthine or uridine and during a chase measured quantitatively the metabolism of ribo- and deoxyribonucleotides, DNA replication, and excretion of nucleosides into the medium. Overproduction of hkm-NT greatly increased excretion of inosine and guanosine but did not affect adenosine or deoxyribonucleosides. dNT-1 overproduction increased excretion of deoxycytidine, thymidine, and in particular deoxyuridine but also uridine and cytidine. We conclude that the hkm-NT is not involved in the regulation of deoxyribonucleotide pools but affects IMP and GTP pools. dNT-1, instead, appears to be the catabolic arm of substrate cycles regulating pyrimidine nucleotide pools. 5′-Nucleotidases are the catabolic members of the substrate cycles postulated to be involved in the regulation of intracellular deoxyribonucleoside triphosphate pools.

Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1988; 57: 349-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (631) Google Scholar). Imbalances in pool sizes are genotoxic and may in severe cases lead to cell death (reviewed in Ref. 2Kunz B.A. Kohalmi S.E. Kunkel T.A. Mathews C.K. McIntosh E.M. Reidy J.A. Mutat. Res. 1994; 318: 1-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). A network of biosynthetic and catabolic enzymes regulates the size of each pool with the enzyme ribonucleotide reductase playing a pivotal role (1Reichard P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1988; 57: 349-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (631) Google Scholar). This enzyme not only directs the total flow of metabolites into DNA but also, via an exquisite allosteric mechanism, divides the flow into separate channels to maintain the balance between the four pools. A second level of control comes from the dynamic interplay between kinases, catalyzing the salvage of deoxyribonucleosides, and nucleotidases, involved in the catabolism of deoxyribonucleotides (1Reichard P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1988; 57: 349-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (631) Google Scholar). The two groups of enzymes form substrate (or futile) cycles (3Koshland Jr., D.E. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1984; 9: 155-159Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 4Newsholme E.A. Challiss R.A.J. Crabtree B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1984; 9: 277-280Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (65) Google Scholar) by catalyzing two opposite irreversible reactions whose net result is the hydrolysis of ATP to ADP and Pi (Fig.1). This seemingly wasteful exercise provides the cell with a mechanism for the fine tuning of dNTP pools (1Reichard P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1988; 57: 349-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (631) Google Scholar) that relies on the difference in cell permeability between nucleosides and nucleotides. Nucleosides move freely between the inside and outside of the cell, whereas nucleotides remain trapped inside (Fig. 1). When catabolism outweighs anabolism, deoxyribonucleosides accumulate and are excreted. In the opposite situation, they are imported and further metabolized to dNTPs. The excretion or the import of a nucleoside over the cell membrane can be used as a measure of the activity of substrate cycles. “Auxiliary” catabolic enzymes (deaminases, phosphorylases, and hydrolases) remove some of the nucleosides and thereby shift the equilibrium in the direction of catabolism (Fig. 1). The importance of these enzymes for the regulation of dNTP pools is apparent from the finding that their genetic loss leads to severe dysfunctions that depend on the accumulation of specific dNTPs in special cell types (reviewed in Ref. 5Martin J.r, DW. Gelfand E.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1981; 50: 845-877Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Thus, the loss of either adenosine deaminase or purine nucleoside phosphorylase leads to severe combined immune deficiency caused by the accumulation of dATP and dGTP, respectively, in T and B cells. These cells are low in nucleotidase activity (6Carson D. Kaye J. Wasson D.B. J. Immunol. 1981; 126: 348-352PubMed Google Scholar), and the balance in their substrate cycles is normally shifted toward anabolism. They are therefore particularly sensitive to the excess of deoxyadenosine or deoxyguanosine in the blood stream caused by the absence of the deaminase or phosphorylase. The biological mechanism underlying the two immunodeficiency diseases provides considerable validation for the importance of substrate cycles. An additional similar example comes from the recent demonstration that the genetic loss of thymidine phosphorylase leads to severe mitochondrial dysfunction (7Nishino I. Spinazzola A. Irano M. Science. 1999; 283: 689-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (745) Google Scholar). We have for some time used isotope flow experiments with cultured cells to study substrate cycles. Mouse 3T6 cells (8Bianchi V. Pontis E. Reichard P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 986-990Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), hamster V79 (9Bianchi V. Pontis E. Reichard P. Mol.

Biochem. 1991; 196: 239-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar) and Chinese hamster ovary cells (11Höglund L. Pontis E. Reichard P. Cancer Res. 1988; 48: 3681-3687PubMed Google Scholar), and human CEM cells (12Bianchi V. Ferraro P. Borella S. Bonvini P. Reichard P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16677-16683Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were incubated with trace amounts of labeled precursors for purine or pyrimidine deoxyribonucleotides, and the flux of isotope through rNTP and dNTP pools into DNA and into deoxyribonucleosides released into the medium was determined. For these experiments we used both normal cells and cells carrying mutations in different enzymes involved in dNTP synthesis. The main results were as follows: (i) in all normal cells the bulk of newly synthesized purine and pyrimidine deoxyribonucleotides was incorporated into DNA, but a fraction was excreted into the medium as deoxyribonucleosides; (ii) inhibition of DNA synthesis greatly increased the excretion of deoxyribonucleosides, and inhibition of dNTP synthesis by hydroxyurea favored their import; and (iii) loss of thymidine kinase resulted in increased excretion of thymidine and deoxyuridine, and loss of deoxycytidine kinase resulted in increased excretion of deoxycytidine and deoxyadenosine. Important for the concept of substrate cycles is the identification of the catabolic nucleotidase(s). Three ubiquitous classes of 5′-nucleotidases are known in higher organisms, differing in protein structure and substrate specificity: (i) the cytosolic highKm nucleotidase (hkm-NT) (13Itoh R. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. 1992; 105B: 13-19Google Scholar); (ii) the cytosolic 5′(3′)-deoxynucleotidase (dNT-1) (14Fritzson P. Smith I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1971; 235: 128-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 15Rampazzo C. Johansson M. Gallinaro L. Ferraro P. Hellman U. Karlsson A. Reichard P. Bianchi V. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5409-5415Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) and a closely related mitochondrial enzyme (dNT-2) (16Rampazzo C. Gallinaro L. Milanesi E. Frigimelica E. Reichard P. Bianchi V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 8239-8244Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar); and (iii) an ectonucleotidase attached to the cell membrane via a glycosyl-phosphoinositol anchor (17Zimmermann H. Biochem. J. 1992; 285: 345-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (758) Google Scholar, 18Resta R. Yamashita Y. Thompson L. Immunol. Rev. 1998; 161: 95-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). An additional cytosolic nucleotidase with a specificity for AMP and high activity in muscle and heart, was recently cloned (19Sala-Newby G.B. Skladanowski A.C Newby A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17789-17793Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Which nucleotidase participates in substrate cycles involving deoxyribonucleotides? Earlier isotope flow experiments from our laboratory appear to exclude the ectonucleotidase (20Bianchi V. Griesmacher A. Chiba P. Müller M.M. Purine and Pyrimidine, Metabolism in Man. IX. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1998: 501-506Google Scholar). Here we report experiments with human 293 and hamster V79 cell lines in which the cDNAs for the cytosolic nucleotidases were under the control of an inducible promoter. By isotope flow experiments with labeled hypoxanthine and uridine, we determined in induced and noninduced cells the incorporation of isotope into nucleotide pools and DNA and into the ribo- and deoxyribonucleosides excreted into the medium. Overproduction of the hkm-NT resulted in an increased excretion of inosine and guanosine but not adenosine or deoxyribonucleosides. Overproduction of dNT-1 gave an increased excretion of pyrimidine deoxyribonucleosides as well as uridine and cytidine. The results suggest that the hkm-NT participates in the regulation of the pools of some purine ribonucleotides and that dNT-1 is involved in substrate cycles of pyrimidine ribo- and deoxyribonucleotides. [5,6-3H]uridine (40 Ci/mmol), [8-3H]hypoxanthine (30 Ci/mmol) for cell culture experiments, 3H-labeled thymidine, deoxycytidine for kinase assays, and 32P-labeled dATP and dTTP for pool determinations were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. [14C]IMP and [3H]dUMP were from Moravek. For cell culture experiments, the precursors were used without further dilution; for enzyme assays the radioactivity was diluted to 300–400 cpm·nmol−1. 32P-Labeled nucleotides were diluted to ∼2000 cpm·pmol−1.

They were routinely grown in a humidified incubator at 37 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and supplemented with 7%fetal calf serum, 1%glutamine and antibiotics. Cell cultures were tested periodically for absence of mycoplasma contamination. Cells were lysed in a solution of 20 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.8, 15%glycerol, 2 mmEDTA, 1%Triton X, 1 mm dithiothreitol. After centrifugation for 10 min at 14,000 rpm in an Eppendorf centrifuge, dNT-1 and hkm-NT activities were determined in the supernatants with [14C]IMP (22Gazziola C. Moras M. Ferraro P. Gallinaro L. Verin R. Rampazzo C. Reichard P. Bianchi V. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 253: 474-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) and [3H]dUMP (15Rampazzo C. Johansson M. Gallinaro L. Ferraro P. Hellman U. Karlsson A. Reichard P. Bianchi V. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5409-5415Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), respectively, as substrates. Thymidine kinase and deoxycytidine kinase activities were determined from the phosphorylation of the corresponding deoxyribonucleosides (23Sherley J.L. Kelly T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 375-382Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Ives D.H. Wang S.M. Methods Enzymol. 1978; 51: 337-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). All enzyme assays were made with two concentrations of crude protein to ascertain proportionality. Specific activities are defined as nmol of product formed during 1 min/mg of protein. Protein was quantitated as described (25Bradford M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (215632) Google Scholar). Ponasterone A (4 μm for 293 cells and 8 μm for V79 cells) was added to the cultures during 48 h (induction of hkm-NT in 293 cells and dNT-1 in V79 cells) or 72 h (induction of dNT-1 in 293 cells) before addition of isotope. Extracts of noninduced cells showed a basal nucleotidase specific activity between 3 and 7. After induction, the extracts from 293 cells showed specific activities between 80 and 150, and extracts from V79 cells showed specific activities between 15 and 25. The experiments were started by seeding 1.5–2 × 105 cells on polylysine-coated dishes (diameter, 3.5 cm). Half of the cultures were induced with ponasterone, and the other half served as controls. Incubation was in 2.5 ml of medium at 37 °C. On the evening before addition of isotope, the medium was replaced with fresh medium containing dialyzed fetal calf serum to minimize the effect of the presence of nucleosides in the serum. After 2 or 3 days from seeding, when the cultures had reached a density of 5–7 × 105 cells/dish, 1.5 ml of medium was withdrawn and retained in the incubator for the chase of radioactivity. The cultures were then incubated with either labeled hypoxanthine (final concentration, 0.3 μm) + 0.5 μm immucillin and 10 μm erythro-9-(2-hydroxy-3-nonyl)adenine or with labeled uridine (final concentration, 1.0 μm). After 2 h the radioactive medium was removed and replaced with the earlier withdrawn nonlabeled medium containing immucillin anderythro-9-(2-hydroxy-3-nonyl)adenine, where required. Dishes were removed for analyses after 1 and 2 h of further incubation at 37 °C. All handling of the cultures outside the incubator was in a climatized 37 °C room to avoid perturbations of cell metabolism. After removal from the incubator, the dishes were washed twice with prewarmed saline solution. The dishes were placed on ice, and the cells were extracted with 1 ml of 60%methanol for 30 min (21Miles R.W. Tyker P.C. Furneaux R.H. Bagdassarian C.K. Schramm V.L. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 8615-8621Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). The methanolic solution was transferred to a centrifuge tube immersed in a boiling water bath and heated for 3 min. This served to kill all enzymes that may influence pool analyses. Methanol was removed by vacuum evaporation. The dry residue was dissolved in 0.2 ml of water and used for pool analyses. Great care was taken during methanol extraction not to detach cells from the dish. After removal of methanol, 1 ml of 0.3 mNaOH was added, and the dish was incubated at 37 °C for 24 h to dissolve the cells and hydrolyze RNA. The absorbance at 260 nm of the clear solution provided a correction factor for unequal growth on different dishes. This correction that rarely amounted to more than 10%was made by dividing all the values for total radioactivity (Fig.2, shaded boxes) by the absorbance at 260 nm of the corresponding NaOH solution. By multiplying this value by 2, we could then relate the values to 106cells because 106 cells dissolved in 1 ml of 0.3m NaOH showed an absorbance of 2 at 260 nm. A portion of the NaOH solution was precipitated with HClO4 to measure isotope incorporation into DNA. These measurements were made on portions of the material extracted from the cells by 60%methanol. rNTPs were separated by HPLC chromatography on a Partisil SAX column (Whatman) with 0.4 m ammonium phosphate as the mobile phase with a Waters ML3255 machine. The total radioactivity present in each nucleotide peak was determined, and the amount of nucleotide was obtained by automatic integration of the peak area. From the two values we could then calculate the specific radioactivity (cpm/pmol) of each rNTP. The specific activities of dNTPs were obtained by a modification of the method of Sherman and Fyfe (26Sherman P.A. Fyfe J.A. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 180: 222-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). As originally described, this method measures the total amount of a given dNTP in a cell extract with a synthetic oligonucleotide and DNA polymerase. To permit also the determination of specific activity, we first constructed a standard curve for increasing amounts of the relevant dNTP, labeled with tritium, and an excess of 32P-labeled dATP (or [32P]dTTP for determination of [3H]dATP) under the conditions given by Sherman and Fyfe (26Sherman P.A. Fyfe J.A. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 180: 222-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). With a determined large excess of polymerase the incorporation of 32P into the oligonucleotide corresponded quantitatively to the increasing amounts of the relevant dNTP. Because of quenching on the DEAE paper, the 3H values only amounted to 50–70%of the32P values. In the actual experiment, two different portions of cell extract were incubated with the32P-labeled dNTP under the conditions established for the standard curve. The amount of dNTP present in the extract was obtained directly from the incorporation of 32P. From the quench-corrected incorporation of tritium we could then calculate the specific activity of the dNTP by dividing the 3H value with the amount of the nucleotide. Once the required amount of DNA polymerase had been established, this method gave reproducible results for the specific activity of each of the four dNTPs in extracts from as little as 104 cells. To remove all proteins 0.2 ml of ice-cold medium was precipitated with 0.005 ml of cold concentrated HClO4 and centrifuged. The supernatant solution was neutralized immediately with 4 m KOH, and the precipitated KClO4 was removed by centrifugation. It was important to work rapidly at low temperature to avoid hydrolysis of the purine N-glycosidic bonds of deoxyribonucleosides. Nucleosides in 0.05 ml of the supernatant were separated by HPLC on a Nucleosil 5–100 C18 column (250 × 4.6 mm) at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Purine nucleosides were separated by elution with 20 mm ammonium acetate, pH 5.0, containing increasing amounts of methanol (5%during the first 20 min, followed by 10%during 25 min and finally 50%during 15 min). The following retention times were found: hypoxanthine, 8.5 min; guanine, 9.0 min; inosine, 14.5 min; guanosine, 17 min; deoxyinosine, 19 min; deoxyguanosine, 23 min; adenosine, 35.5 min; and deoxyadenosine, 43 min. Pyrimidine nucleosides were separated similarly with 40 mm ammonium acetate, pH 5.0, and increasing amounts of methanol (0%methanol during 20 min, followed by 50%methanol during 30 min). Following retention times were found: cytidine, 10 min; deoxycytidine, 13 min; uridine, 16 min; deoxyuridine, 21 min; and thymidine, 35 min. The appropriate chromatographic fractions were used to determine the total radioactivity of each nucleoside. A correction was applied to this value as volume changes occurring during protein removal from the medium were difficult to control. An appropriate factor was obtained for each chromatogram from the absorption peak of an unknown component of the medium that had a retention time of 24 and 9 min, respectively, in the purine and pyrimidine chromatograms. The size of this peak was exclusively dependent on the amount of medium and was not affected by the amount of cells used in the experiment. Thus, it could be used safely for volume corrections. The total radioactivity of each nucleoside peak was normalized from the integrated absorption value of this peak. The participation of a particular 5′-nucleotidase in substrate cycles was investigated by determining whether overproduction of the enzyme increased the excretion of nucleosides. The cDNAs for either hkm-NT or dNT-1 on plasmids under the control of an inducible promoter were transfected into human 293 or hamster V79 cells. Induction with ponasterone A increased the activity of the enzymes in cellular extracts 5–30-fold. Induced and control noninduced cells were first labeled from radioactive hypoxanthine as precursor of purine nucleotides (Fig. 2 A) or uridine as precursor of pyrimidine nucleotides (Fig. 2 B). During a chase we then measured the accumulation of radioactivity (as cpm) in various end products (nucleosides excreted into the medium and DNA, indicated in shaded boxes in Fig. 2) as well as the specific radioactivities (cpm/pmol) of NTPs (indicated in boxes in Fig. 2). From these values we transformed into pmol/min the cpm accumulated in each excreted nucleoside or incorporated into DNA. During the first 2 h of the experiments, increasing amounts of radioactivity were incorporated via “salvage” enzymes (hypoxanthine phosphoribosyl transferase for hypoxanthine, uridine kinase for uridine) into all purine or pyrimidine ribo- and deoxyribonucleotides, RNA, and DNA. After 2 h the labeled precursor was removed from the cultures by change of medium, and the specific radioactivities of the relevant rNTPs and dNTPs were determined immediately and after 1 and 2 h. As an example, Fig.3 gives the results from two typical experiments with dNT-1 overproducing 293 cells: one labeled from radioactive hypoxanthine (Fig. 3 A) and the other labeled from uridine (Fig. 3 B). In these and all other experiments only small differences were observed between overproducing and control cells. The specific activities of the nucleoside triphosphates had not yet reached isotope equilibrium, but this does not affect our calculations that concern the chase period. After change of the medium, the values decreased with time by dilution from de novosynthesis. dNTPs were always more heavily labeled than rNTPs, suggesting that their synthesis in S phase cells occurred from a ribonucleotide pool with higher than average specific activity. The lower specific activity of dTTP, relative to dCTP, is due to loss of tritium from the 5 position of uridine during transformation of dUMP to dTMP. The specific activity of DNA increased continuously by incorporation of radioactivity from dNTPs. We used such data to calculate rates of DNA synthesis in the different experiments. From the hypoxanthine experiment in Fig. 3 A we calculate that the dATP and dGTP pools during the 2-h period had average specific activities of 340 and 307 cpm/pmol, respectively. During that period DNA accumulated radioactivity from the two dNTPs at a rate of 1075 cpm/min/106 cells. Using an A/G ratio of 1.32 for mammalian DNA, we can transform this accumulation into the incorporation of 1.88 pmol/min of adenine and 1.42 pmol/min of guanine. A possible complication in experiments with labeled hypoxanthine was the degradation of purine nucleosides into free purine bases by adenosine deaminase and purine nucleoside phosphorylase. In a preliminary experiment we found only labeled inosine and traces of other labeled purine nucleosides in the medium. All amounts increased dramatically when we addederythro-9-(2-hydroxy-3-nonyl)adenine to inhibit adenosine deaminase and immucillin H (21Miles R.W. Tyker P.C. Furneaux R.H. Bagdassarian C.K. Schramm V.L. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 8615-8621Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar) to inhibit purine nucleoside phosphorylase. Immucillin had to be used at 0.5 μmconcentration to give full effect. Neither of the two compounds inhibited the incorporation of labeled hypoxanthine into RNA or DNA (data not shown), suggesting that cellular metabolism was not affected. [3H]Hypoxanthine was used in three experiments to label purine nucleotides and DNA in 293 cells overproducing hkm-NT and in two experiments with 293 or V79 cells overproducing dNT-1. Figs. 4 and5 illustrate the effects of enzyme overproduction on the excretion of ribo- and deoxyribonucleosides into the medium. Fig. 4 compares time curves for the excretion of purine ribonucleosides from control and induced 293 cells, with one line overproducing hkm-NT (Fig. 4 A) and the other overproducing dNT-1 (Fig. 4 B). For adenosine and guanosine the results are expressed as pmol/106 cells, calculated from the amount of isotope that accumulated in the nucleosides and the specific activities of the relevant triphosphates. In the case of inosine, we present the data as cpm/106 cells because the specific activity of IMP could not be determined. Induction of hkm-NT (Fig. 4 A) lead to an ∼10-fold increase in excretion of inosine and guanosine but had no effect on adenosine. In this experiment hkm-NT activity was 30-fold increased. In other experiments in which overproduction of hkm-NT was only 5-fold, similar results were obtained but with smaller increases in excretion of inosine and guanosine (not shown). In contrast, induction of dNT-1 (Fig. 4 B) did not increase excretion of any ribonucleosides.Figure 5Effects of overproduction of hkm-NT or dNT-1 on the excretion of deoxyguanosine (A) and deoxyadenosine (B) during a 2-h period by different cell lines labeled from [3H]hypoxanthine. Theblack columns represent the controls, and the open columns represent the induced cells.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The excretion of deoxyguanosine and deoxyadenosine in the same experiments and in an additional experiment with V79 cells overproducing dNT-1 is illustrated in Fig. 5. Excretion of the deoxyribonucleosides is given as percentage of the total reduction of the corresponding ribonucleotide, taken as the sum of the incorporation of the relevant purine into DNA and the excretion of the deoxyribonucleoside. Induction of either hkm-NT or dNT-1 decreased the excretion of both deoxyribonucleosides. We found earlier (22Gazziola C. Moras M. Ferraro P. Gallinaro L. Verin R. Rampazzo C. Reichard P. Bianchi V. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 253: 474-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) 2C. Gazziola, P. Ferraro, M. Moras, P. Reichard, and V. Bianchi, unpublished data. that cells overproducing either nucleotidase contain smaller dNTP pools and therefore have lower substrate concentrations for a putative nucleotidase. This may explain the decreased excretion of deoxyribonucleosides after induction. [[5,6-3H]uridine was used to label pyrimidine nucleotides and DNA in induced and control 293 cells overproducing hkm-NT or dNT-1, and in V79 cells overproducing dNT-1. Time curves for the excretion of pyrimidine ribonucleosides are shown in Fig. 6 A (induction of hkm-NT in 293 cells) and 6B (induction of dNT-1 in 293 cells). Enzyme induction increased the excretion of both uridine and cytidine. Fig. 7 illustrates the excretion of pyrimidine deoxyribonucleosides in all three experiments. The values are again given as percentages of total ribonucleotide reduction. In this case, CDP reduction was the source of both dCTP and dTTP (Fig.2 B). Total reduction of CDP was taken as the sum of cytosine and thymine incorporation into DNA plus excretion of deoxcytidine, deoxyuridine, and thymidine. We neglect the small part of dTTP formed by reduction of UDP (9Bianchi V. Pontis E. Reichard P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 4218-4224Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Overproduction of dNT-1 lead to an increased excretion of deoxycytidine (Fig. 7 A) and deoxyuridine (Fig. 7 B) in both cell lines. In 293 cells the effect on deoxyuridine is particulary striking. The data in Fig. 7 are the means from four parallel experiments with the cell lines overproducing dNT-1. The differences between induced and control cells were statistically significant with p values (Student's t test) of 0.05 or less. In 293 cells, the increase in thymidine excretion (Fig. 7 C) was also statistically significant but not in V79 cells. This may be due to the smaller increase in nucleotidase activity which in these experiments was 6-fold in V79 cells and 20-fold in 293 cells. In a single experiment, induction of hkm-NT in 293 cells did not significantly affect the excretion of pyrimidine deoxyribonucleosides (Fig. 7). The anabolic components of the investigated substrate cycles are deoxycytidine kinase for the phosphorylation of deoxycytidine, deoxyadenosine and deoxyguanosine, and thymidine kinase for the phosphorylation of thymidine. It is evident from Figs. 5 and 7that the inherent excretion of deoxyadenosine, deoxyguanosine, and deoxycytidine was much larger in 293 cells than in V79 cells. Assays in extracts from the two noninduced lines gave closely similar results for deoxyribonucleotidase activity, excluding differences in the breakdown of monophosphates. However, they differed widely with respect to the specific activity of deoxycytidine kinase which was 1.2 in 293 cells and 13 in V79 cells. The corresponding values for thymidine kinase were 34 and 42. The low deoxycytidine kinase activity of 293 cells may explain why these cells showed such a huge excretion of the deoxyribonucleosides whose phosphorylation is catalyzed by this enzyme. Genetic methodology provides a powerful tool to study substrate cycles. Thus, thymidine kinase was identified as the anabolic enzyme of the dTMP/thymidine substrate cycle from isotope flow experiments where the excretion of thymidine and deoxyuridine was increased stepwise from tk+/tk+ viatk+/tk− to tk−/tk−cell mutants (11Höglund L. Pontis E. Reichard P. Cancer Res. 1988; 48: 3681-3687PubMed Google Scholar). Deoxycytidine kinase was similarly identified for the dCMP/deoxycytidine and dAMP/deoxyadenosine cycles (11Höglund L. Pontis E. Reichard P. Cancer Res. 1988; 48: 3681-3687PubMed Google Scholar, 12Bianchi V. Ferraro P. Borella S. Bonvini P. Reichard P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16677-16683Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cells devoid of 5′-nucleotidase activity are not known, and we could therefore not use the same technique to identify nucleotidases participating in substrate cycles. Instead, we investigated to what extent an increase in the activity of a particular nucleotidase affects nucleoside excretion. Increased excretion would suggest that this enzyme represents the catabolic arm of the substrate cycle. We now show that overproduction of each of two cytosolic nucleotidases increases the excretion of specific groups of nucleosides. hkm-NT increases inosine and guanosine excretion (Fig. 4 A),i.e. two ribonucleosides, but not that of deoxyribonucleosides or adenosine. In as single experiment (Fig.6 A) uridine and cytidine were also affected slightly, but this result requires further confirmation. The specificity for inosine and guanosine and lack of activity for adenosine agree well with the known substrate specificity of hkm-NT (13Itoh R. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. 1992; 105B: 13-19Google Scholar). Our results agree with recent conclusions by Sala-Newby et al. (27Sala-Newby G.B. Freeman N.V.E. Skladanowski A.C. Newby A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11666-11671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), who used a completely different technique to investigate the in situspecificity of the hkm-NT. They also demonstrated that the in situ dephosphorylation of AMP, but not that of IMP or GMP, was catalyzed by an AMP-specific 5′-nucleotidase (28Newby A.C. Biochem. J. 1988; 253: 123-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The main objective of our work was to identify the 5′-nucleotidases that act on deoxyribonucleotides. That the hkm-NT did not increase excretion of deoxyadenosine was expected from the in vitrospecificity of the enzyme (13Itoh R. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. 1992; 105B: 13-19Google Scholar) and from the finding that the resistance toward the toxicity of deoxyadenosine and 2-chloroadenosine of cells overproducing the enzyme was not increased (22Gazziola C. Moras M. Ferraro P. Gallinaro L. Verin R. Rampazzo C. Reichard P. Bianchi V. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 253: 474-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The lack of activity of the hkm-NT for dGMP was more surprising because the isolated enzyme dephosphorylates dGMP quite actively. A possible explanation is that the Km for dGMP is high (0.1–0.3 mm) and that the dGTP pool of cells is the smallest of the four dNTP pools (5–10 pmol/106 cells). Assuming that the dGMP pool is less than 10%of the dGTP pool and that the volume of 106 cells is 0.2 μl, the intracellular dGMP concentration can be estimated to be ∼1–4 μm. The results with dNT-1 were more gratifying. Overproduction of the enzyme gave a clear increase in the excretion of deoxycytidine and in particular deoxyuridine in two separate cell lines (Fig. 7). The large effect on deoxyuridine agrees with the preference of the enzyme for dUMP as substrate (14Fritzson P. Smith I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1971; 235: 128-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 15Rampazzo C. Johansson M. Gallinaro L. Ferraro P. Hellman U. Karlsson A. Reichard P. Bianchi V. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5409-5415Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In 293 cells induction of dNT-1 also increased thymidine excretion. The smaller increase in V79 cells was not statistically significant, which may be explained by the lower overproduction of the enzyme. These results are all the more significant because overproduction of the nucleotidases in several other cases resulted in a decreased excretion, probably caused by lowering dNTP pool sizes. Also the excretion of pyrimidine ribonucleosides was clearly increased in 293 cells (Fig.6 B). Our results thus indicate that dNT-1 overproduction increases the excretion of pyrimidine nucleosides and that the enzyme is involved in substrate cycles for pyrimidine ribo- and deoxyribonucleotides. Our experiments were carried out with cells in different phases of the cell cycle, and the isotope data reflect the metabolism of cells both in and out of S phase. Ribonucleotides were labeled from hypoxanthine and uridine in all cells, but deoxyribonucleotides were labeled only in S phase cells, because ribonucleotide reductase is a cell cycle-regulated enzyme. As a consequence our data on ribonucleoside excretion come from a different cell population than the data concerning deoxyribonucleoside excretion. The general conclusions given above should, however, not be affected by this consideration. The large differences between 293 and V79 cells in the excretion of several deoxyribonucleosides deserve a final comment. We believe that they are explained by the large differences in deoxycytidine kinase activity between the two cell lines. This then is a further example of the function of substrate cycles in pool regulation. The identification of dNT-1 as one of the nucleotidases involved in the turnover of deoxyribonucleotide pools has consequences for antiblastic and antiviral therapy. The sensitivity of the monophosphates of analogs to dephosphorylation by dNT-1 may become one important parameter in the evaluation of new drugs.

A mutant of the M3-muscarinic receptor, where residues Lys370–Ser425 of the third intracellular loop had been deleted, showed a reduced ability to activate the ERK-1/2 pathway. This reduction was evident despite the fact that the receptor was able to couple efficiently to the phospholipase C second messenger pathway. Importantly, the ERK-1/2 responses to both the wild-type M3-muscarinic receptor and ΔLys370–Ser425 receptor mutant were dependent on the activity of protein kinase C. Our results, therefore, indicate the existence of two mechanistic components to the ERK-1/2 response, which appear to act in concert. First, the activation of protein kinase C through the diacylglycerol arm of the phospholipase C signaling pathway and a second component, absent in the ΔLys370–Ser425 receptor mutant, that is independent of the phospholipase C signaling pathway. The reduced ability of the ΔLys370–Ser425 receptor mutant to activate the ERK-1/2 pathway correlated with an ∼80% decrease in the ability of the receptor to undergo agonist-mediated phosphorylation. Furthermore, we have previously shown that M3-muscarinic receptor phosphorylation can be inhibited by a dominant negative mutant of casein kinase 1α and by expression of a peptide corresponding to the third intracellular loop of the M3-muscarinic receptor. Expression of these inhibitors of receptor phosphorylation reduced the wild-type M3-muscarinic receptor ERK-1/2 response. We conclude that phosphorylation of the M3-muscarinic receptor on sites in the third intracellular loop by casein kinase 1α contributes to the mechanism of receptor activation of ERK-1/2 by working in concert with the diacylglycerol/PKC arm of the phospholipase C signaling pathway.

The activation of the ERK-1/2 pathway by GPCRs is mediated by any one of a number of mechanisms (1Malarkey J. Belham C.M. Paul A. Graham A. Scott P.H. Plevin R. Biochem. J. 1995; 309: 361-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar) probably reflecting the diversity of receptors within this large gene family. These mechanisms appear quite distinct; for example, ERK-1/2 activation has been shown to proceed via a tyrosine kinase-dependent mechanism for some receptors and a tyrosine kinase-independent manner for others (2Wan Y. Kurosaki T. Huang X-Y. Nature. 1996; 380: 541-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar, 3Hawes B.E. van Biesen T. Koch W.J. Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol.

Despite this diversity, common features do exist, the most prominent of which is that GPCRs activate ERK-1/2 by acting initially through “classical” heterotrimeric G-protein signaling pathways (4Gutkind J.S.

These studies indicate that the mechanism for Gq/11-coupled receptor-mediated ERK-1/2 activation is dependent on the coupling of the receptor to Gq/11-heterotrimeric G-proteins and subsequent phospholipase C signaling through Ca2+mobilization and PKC activation. A further component in the activation of the ERK-1/2 pathway by GPCRs has recently been suggested from studies on the β2-adrenergic receptor where receptor phosphorylation has been shown to play a central role. The β2-adrenergic receptor is phosphorylated by both PKA and the G-protein coupled receptor kinases (GRKs) (30Pitcher J.A. Freedman N.J. Lefkowitz R.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 653-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (1072) Google Scholar). PKA phosphorylation of the receptor on sites on the third intracellular loop has been proposed to act as a “molecular switch” coupling the receptor to Gi-proteins and subsequently the activation of the ERK-1/2 pathway via the generation of βγ-subunits (31Daaka Y. Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. Nature. 1997; 390: 88-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (1077) Google Scholar). The β2-adrenergic receptor can also be phosphorylated in an agonist-dependent manner by the GRKs, particularly GRK-2. This has classically been considered to result in the recruitment of β-arrestin and receptor desensitization (30Pitcher J.A. Freedman N.J. Lefkowitz R.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 653-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (1072) Google Scholar). However, recent studies have shown that β-arrestin can act as an adaptor protein recruiting activated c-Src to the plasma membrane in a process that is essential in the activation of the ERK-1/2 pathway by the β2-adrenergic receptor (32Luttrell L.M. Ferguson S.S.G. Daaka Y. Miller W.E. Maudsley S. Della Rocca G.J. Lin F-T Kawakatsu H. Owada K. Luttrell D.K. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Science. 1999; 283: 655-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (1264) Google Scholar). In the present paper, we investigate the role played by receptor phosphorylation in the activation of the ERK-1/2 pathway by the Gq/11-coupled M3-muscarinic receptor. This receptor is rapidly phosphorylated on serine following agonist occupation (33Tobin A.B. Nahorski S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9817-9823Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, in contrast to the β2-adrenergic receptor, which is phosphorylated by the GRKs, M3-muscarinic receptors are phosphorylated in an agonist-dependent manner on sites in the third intracellular loop by casein kinase 1α (CK1α) (34Tobin A.B.

Deletion of a region of the third intracellular loop of the human M3-muscarinic receptor (Lys370–Ser425) reduced receptor phosphorylation by ∼80% (35Budd D.C. McDonald J.E. Tobin A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19667-19675Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Furthermore, expression of a dominant negative mutant of CK1α or a peptide corresponding to the third intracellular loop of the receptor, reduced receptor phosphorylation (35Budd D.C. McDonald J.E. Tobin A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19667-19675Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Using these reagents in the present study, we investigate the role played by agonist-mediated receptor phosphorylation in the activation of the ERK-1/2 pathway. CHO cell lines were grown in medium consisting of αMEM supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 IU/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 2.5 μg/ml fungizone. Cells were grown in a 5% CO2, 95% air, humidified incubator at 37 °C. The ΔLys370–Ser425 receptor mutant clone 2 was maintained in blasticidine (5 μg/ml). The dominant negative mutant of CK1α (F-CK1αK46R) was generated by point mutagenesis of the lysine residue at position 46, which represents the invariant lysine at the ATP binding site of CK1α. The lysine residue was mutated to an arginine as described previously (35Budd D.C. McDonald J.E. Tobin A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19667-19675Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The sequence encoding amino acids Ser345–Leu463 from the third intracellular loop of the M3-muscarinic receptor was cloned intoBam HI and Eco RI sites in pcDNA-3 (Invitrogen) as described previously (35Budd D.C. McDonald J.E. Tobin A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19667-19675Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Ser 425—Two stably transfected CHO cell lines expressing the M3-muscarinic receptor deletion mutant ΔLys370–Ser425 were used in the present study. Clone 1 was generated by digestion of the M3-muscarinic receptor coding sequence contained in pcDNA-3 (Invitrogen) with Hin dIII and then religating the plasmid. This removed the coding sequence for amino acids Lys370–Ser425 inclusive, but maintained the reading frame of the remaining cDNA. This construct was transfected into CHO cells, and clones were selected using medium supplemented with G-418 (200 μg/ml). The second clone used (clone 2) originated from another transfection where the cDNA encoding the ΔLys370–Ser425 receptor mutant was subcloned into pcDNA-6 (Invitrogen). Clones from this transfection were selected using medium supplemented with blasticidine (5 μg/ml). Cells were plated onto 6-well dishes 24 h before transfection. Cells (15–20% confluent) were transfected with either 3 μg of F-CK1αK46R or 3i-loop peptide per well using 8 μl of Fugene 6 transfection reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Cells were used 48 h after transfection. Using a green fluorescent protein construct, we estimated that the transfection efficiency was ∼70%. M3-Muscarinic receptor expression on intact plated-down cells was determined using a saturating concentration of the hydrophilic muscarinic antagonist [3H]N-methyl scopolamine ([3H]NMS, ∼0.5 nm) as described previously (35Budd D.C. McDonald J.E. Tobin A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19667-19675Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of 20 μm atropine and was < 3% of the total binding. Cells grown in 24-well dishes were washed with Krebs/HEPES buffer (HEPES (10 mm), NaCl (118 mm), KHPO3 (1.17 mm), KCl (4.3 mm), MgSO4·7 (1.17 mm), CaCl2 (1.3 mm), NaHCO3 (25.0 mm), glucose (11.7 mm), pH 7.4) and challenged with agonist for the appropriate times. Incubations were terminated by rapid aspiration, addition of ice-cold 0.5 m trichloroacetic acid, and transfer to an ice-bath. After 15 min, the supernatant was removed and neutralized by addition of EDTA and freon/tri-n-octylamine as described previously (36Tobin A.B. Lambert D.G. Nahorski S.R. Mol. Pharmacol. 1992; 42: 1042-1048PubMed Google Scholar). Extracts were brought to pH 7 by addition of NaHCO3 and stored at 4 °C until analysis. Ins(1,4,5)P3 mass measurements were performed using a radio-receptor assay described previously (37Challiss R.A.J. Batty I.H. Nahorski S.R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1988; 157: 684-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). CHO cells grown to confluence in 6-well plates were serum-starved for 1 h in Krebs/HEPES buffer and then stimulated with the appropriate agents. Stimulation was terminated by aspiration, and cells were incubated for 10 min in lysis buffer (Tris (20 mm), Nonidet P-40 (0.5%), NaCl (250 mm), EDTA (3 mm), EGTA (3 mm), phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (1 mm), Na3VO4 (1 mm), dithiothreitol (1 mm), benzamidine (5 μg/ml), pH 7.6) at 4 °C. Solubilized CHO cell lysates were pre-cleared by centrifuging at 14,000 rpm for 5 min. Endogenous MAP kinase was immunoprecipitated using 0.2 μg of anti-Erk-1/2 antiserum (Santa Cruz). Protein A-Sepharose immobilized MAP kinase was washed twice in lysis buffer and twice in assay buffer (HEPES (20 mm), β-glycerophosphate (20 mm), MgCl2 (10 mm), dithiothreitol (1 mm), Na3VO4 (50 μm),pH 7.2). Washed pellets were resuspended in assay buffer containing 2 μCi of [32P]ATP, 20 μm ATP, 200 μm EGFr (peptide encompassing region 661–681 of the EGF receptor), and reactions were left to proceed for 20 min at 37 °C. Reactions were terminated by the addition of 25% trichloroacetic acid and spotted onto P81 phosphocellulose paper squares (Whatman). Squares were washed four times with 0.05% orthophosphoric acid and once with acetone, and radioactivity associated with the EGFr was determined by liquid scintillation counting. Confluent monolayers of cells in 175 cm2 flasks were harvested and resuspended in 2.5 ml of Krebs/HEPES buffer. A 0.5-ml aliquot of this was removed for determination of cellular autofluorescence. Fura-2-acetoxymethyl ester (Fura-2-AM, 5 μm) was added to the remaining 2 ml, which was then left for ∼40 min at room temperature with gentle mixing. Supernatant containing extracellular Fura-2-AM was removed following gentle centrifugation of the 0.5-ml aliquots. Cells were resuspended in a cuvette containing 3 ml of Krebs/HEPES buffer at 37 °C. Using a Perkin-Elmer LS-5B spectrofluorimeter with a cuvette water jacket to maintain the temperature at 37 °C, emission at 509 nm was recorded following excitation at both 340 and 380 nm. The excitation ratio was recorded every 1 s and converted to [Ca2+]i as previously reported (38Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) using 0.1% Triton X-100 in the presence of a saturating [Ca2+] to determine R max and the addition of EGTA to determine R min. Cells were challenged with 10–50 μl of agonist. Initial experiments were conducted in the presence of 1.3 mm extracellular [Ca2+] (as represented in Fig. 4 B). In experiments to determine the potency of intracellular Ca2+ mobilization by the full agonist methacholine (represented in Fig. 4 C), the experiments were conducted in Ca2+-free medium where the Krebs/HEPES buffer had been supplemented with EGTA to reduce extracellular [Ca2+] to ∼100 nm (determined using Fura-2). This was to ensure that the ability of the agonist to mobilize intracellular Ca2+ stores was being measured, because any changes in intracellular Ca2+ concentrations under these conditions would have been the result of release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores with no contribution being made form an influx of extracellular Ca2+. Previous studies from our laboratory and others (21Budd D.C. Rae A. Tobin A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12355-12360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 22Wylie P.G.

J. 2000; 348: 381-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) have shown that M3-muscarinic receptors activate the ERK-1/2 pathway in a PTX-insensitive, PKC-dependent manner. The time course for ERK-1/2 activation peaks at 5 min then falls to a plateau, which is maintained for at least 20 min (21Budd D.C. Rae A. Tobin A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12355-12360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). To test whether receptor phosphorylation plays a role in the regulation of the ERK-1/2 pathway, a mutant M3-muscarinic receptor was used where residues Lys370–Ser425 of the third intracellular loop of the human M3-muscarinic receptor had been deleted. This mutant receptor, termed ΔLys370–Ser425, had previously been demonstrated to show an ∼80% decrease in its ability to undergo agonist-mediated phosphorylation (35Budd D.C. McDonald J.E. Tobin A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19667-19675Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Two stably transfected CHO cell lines were prepared expressing the ΔLys370–Ser425 receptor at levels comparable with the wild-type controls (B max values in fmols of receptor/mg protein: wild type = 908 ± 124, ΔLys370–Ser425 mutant clone 1 = 782 ± 67, mutant clone 2 = 1209 ± 10). Concentration-response analysis of CHO cells expressing the wild-type M3-muscarinic receptor (CHO-m3 cells) showed a receptor-mediated ERK-1/2 activation with a half-maximal response (EC50) to the agonist carbachol of 45 ± 1.3 nm (n = 3, ± S.E., Fig.1.) This is very similar to the EC50 value that we obtained previously using another distinct M3-muscarinic receptor-transfected CHO cell line (21Budd D.C. Rae A. Tobin A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12355-12360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). In contrast to the wild-type receptor, the mutant receptor showed a rightward shift in the ERK-1/2 concentration-response curve to carbachol (Fig. 1). The EC50 values for the two clonal cell lines expressing the ΔLys370–Ser425 mutant were 660 ± 100 nm and 300 ± 100 nm(n = 3, ± S.E.) for clones 1 and 2, respectively. These EC50 values were significantly different from the wild-type receptor values (p < 0.05, Student'st test). In addition to a reduction in the potency of carbachol, there was also a reduction in the maximal ERK-1/2 response with clone 1 showing a 23 ± 7% reduction and clone 2 a 61 ± 5% reduction (n = 3, ± S.E.) in the maximal carbachol response compared with wild-type receptor controls (Fig. 1). The time course for activation of ERK-1/2 was not, however, significantly different between the control and mutant receptors (data not shown). To test for the possibility of clonal variation between the wild-type CHO-m3 cells and mutant receptor cell lines, concentration-response curves for serum-induced ERK-1/2 activation were carried out. The concentration-response curves for serum-activated ERK-1/2 in the mutant receptor CHO cell lines were not significantly different from that of the CHO-m3 cells (Fig. 2). This indicated that there was no clonal difference in the ERK-1/2 pathway stimulated by serum. We have previously shown that the wild-type M3-muscarinic receptor-mediated ERK-1/2 response is dependent on PKC because inhibition of PKC using Ro-318220 or down-regulation of PKC reduced the muscarinic-ERK-1/2 response by >90% (21Budd D.C. Rae A. Tobin A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12355-12360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The ΔLys370–Ser425 receptor mutant response also appeared to be sensitive to PKC inhibition in a manner similar to the wild-type receptor. The phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate ERK-1/2 responses in the CHO-m3 cells and cells expressing ΔLys370–Ser425 receptor mutant (clone 2) were completely inhibited by the PKC inhibitor Ro-318220 (Fig.3). The ERK-1/2 responses to carbachol in the CHO-m3 cells and the cells expressing the ΔLys370–Ser425 receptor mutant were inhibited (∼90%) by Ro-318220 (Fig. 3). We have previously reported that the ΔLys370–Ser425receptor mutant showed agonist and antagonist binding characteristics that were not significantly different from the wild-type receptors (35Budd D.C. McDonald J.E. Tobin A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19667-19675Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). We have also reported that the ΔLys370–Ser425 receptor mutant is coupled to the phospholipase C pathway in a manner analogous to the wild-type receptor. For example, the time course of Ins(1,4,5)P3generation of both the wild-type M3-muscarinic receptor and the ΔLys370–Ser425 receptor mutant peaks within 5–10 s of agonist stimulation and reaches a plateau phase after 60 s, which is maintained for at least 5 min (35Budd D.C. McDonald J.E. Tobin A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19667-19675Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar).

For comparison, another cell line was engineered with tetracycline-regulated expression of a constitutively active variant of the transforming growth factor-β type I receptor ALK5. Expression of activated ALK7 in PC12 cells resulted in activation of Smad2 and Smad3, but not Smad1, as well as the mitogen-activated protein kinases extracellular signal-regulated kinase and c-Jun N-terminal kinase. Reporter assays demonstrated that ALK7 activation stimulates transcription from the Smad-binding element of the Jun-B gene, the plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 gene, and AP-1 elements. In addition, ALK7 activation induced expression of endogenous gene products, including Smad7, c-fos mRNA, and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1. Thymidine incorporation assays revealed an anti-proliferative effect of ALK7 activation in PC12 cells, which correlated with increased transcription from the promoters of cycline-dependent kinase inhibitors p15INK4Band p21. Unexpectedly, ALK7 signaling produced a remarkable change in cell morphology characterized by cell flattening and elaboration of blunt, short cell processes. Interestingly, no such changes were observed upon induction of activated ALK5.

Members of the TGF-β superfamily exhibit an extensive array of biological activities, regulating proliferation, lineage determination, differentiation, migration, adhesion and apoptosis during development, homeostasis, and repair in practically all tissues from flies to humans. TGF-β ligands signal through a complex of two transmembrane receptor serine/threonine kinases belonging to two distinct subfamilies: the type I receptors of ∼55 kDa and the type II receptors of ∼70 kDa. Both receptors cooperate with ligand binding, type II receptors phosphorylate type I receptors, and type I receptors activate members of the Smad family of signal transducers, which then translocate to the nucleus where they take part in a number of DNA binding complexes (1Massagué J. Chen Y.-G. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 627-644PubMed Google Scholar, 2ten Dijke P. Miyazono K. Heldin C.-H. Trends Biochem.

The American Association for the Advancement of Science, Washington D. C.2000Google Scholar). Receptor-specific Smads transiently interact with and become phosphorylated by type I receptors. Smad2 and 3 participate in downstream signaling from TGF-β/activin receptors, and Smad1, 5, and 8 participate in downstream signaling from BMP/GDF receptors. Smad4 form complexes with receptor-specific Smads and is a common mediator of the nuclear responses of TGF-β/activin and BMP/GDF. Smad 6 and 7, on the other hand, are inhibitory Smads that compete with receptor-specific Smads for association with type I receptors. Once in the nucleus, activated Smads may bind DNA on their own or, most commonly, in association with other DNA-specific factors. A number of general transcription factors, coactivators, and corepressors have been found to associate with Smads during TGF-β signaling (1Massagué J. Chen Y.-G. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 627-644PubMed Google Scholar, 2ten Dijke P. Miyazono K. Heldin C.-H. Trends Biochem.

The American Association for the Advancement of Science, Washington D. C.2000Google Scholar). TGF-β has also been shown to activate several other cytoplasmic signaling pathways in addition to the Smads, including several members of the MAP kinase family such as extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) (4Atfi A.

The signaling events leading from the activated receptors to these signaling components remain for the most part undefined. Activin receptor-like kinase 7 (ALK7) is an orphan member of the type I subfamily of receptor serine/threonine kinases (9Rydén M. Imamura T. Jörnvall H. Belluardo N. Neveu I. Trupp M.

ALK7 is highly similar in its intracellular domain to ALK5 (78% identity) and ALK4 (77% identity), type I receptors for TGF-βs and activins, respectively. Despite this similarity, the extracellular domain of ALK7 is very divergent from other type I receptors, indicating that it binds a distinct member of the TGF-β superfamily. In the present work, we have investigated the signaling and biological activities of ALK7 using a constitutively active form of this receptor in an inducible expression system in PC12 cells. Taking advantage of the ability of these cells to adopt a neuronal phenotype after differentiation with nerve growth factor (NGF), we have also studied the interactions between this well characterized cell system of neuronal differentiation and ALK7 signaling. Single-stranded DNA from rat ALK7 subcloned in pBS KS+ (Stratagene) was used for oligonucleotide-based site-directed mutagenesis as described previously (13Kunkel T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 488-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (4894) Google Scholar). The rat pheochromocytoma cell line PC12 was cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% horse serum, 5% fetal bovine serum, 2 mml-glutamine, and 60 μg/ml gentamycin (Life Technologies, Inc.) at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 humidified atmosphere. All serum was screened for absence of tetracycline using the CHO-AA8-Luc Tet-Off control cell line from CLONTECH. Low serum experiments where done using one-twentieth of the serum concentrations specified above. Perfect Lipid 4 (Invitrogen) was used for cell transfections according to the manufacturer's instructions. PC12 cells were transfected with an expression construct of the reverse tetracycline transactivator (pUHD172–1neo) and constitutively active His6-tagged T194D-ALK7 or hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged T204D-ALK5 under the control of the tet-operon and a minimal cytomegalovirus promoter (pUHD10-3) (14Gossen M. Freundlieb S. Bender G. Müller G. Hillen W. Bujard H. Science. 1995; 268: 1766-1769Crossref PubMed Scopus (2027) Google Scholar). Stably transfected cells were selected with 200 μg/ml geneticin (G-418) and 1 μg/ml puromycin (Life Technologies, Inc. and Sigma, respectively), expanded, and individually screened for low leakage and high tetracycline inducibility by RNase protection assay (ALK7) or Western blotting (ALK5). The tetracycline analogue doxycycline was used in all inductions at 1 μg/ml or at the concentrations indicated. RNA isolation was done by guanidinium isothiocyanate lysis and acid phenol extraction as previously described (9Rydén M. Imamura T. Jörnvall H. Belluardo N. Neveu I. Trupp M. Okadome T. ten Dijke P. Ibáñez C.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30603-30609Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). For RNase protection assays, a 310-bp-longHin cII-Pvu II fragment of rat ALK7 cDNA was subcloned into pBS KS+, linearized, and used as template for T7 RNA polymerase. The rat c-fos probe has been previously described (15Trupp M. Scott R. Whittemore S.R. Ibáñez C.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20885-20894Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). A rat glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) riboprobe was used for normalization. 10 μg of total RNA was hybridized to [α-32P]CTP-labeled cRNA probes using a kit from Ambion according to the manufacturer's instructions. Protected bands were visualized and quantified using a STORM840 PhosphorImager and ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics). For protein analyses, cells were lysed in 1% Nonidet P-40 with 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10 mm NaF, 2 mm Na3VO4, and Complete EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The supernatant after mild centrifugation constituted the cytosolic fraction. The nuclear pellet was then further treated by trituration through a 23-gauge needle and boiling in SDS to lyse the nuclei and solubilize nuclear proteins. The fractions were then separated by SDS-PAGE. Bands were electroblotted onto Amersham Hybond-P polyvinylidene difluoride transfer membranes and further processed using standard Western protocols. Protein bands were visualized using enhanced chemifluorescence (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and a STORM840 fluorimaging system and quantification software as described above. Monoclonal anti-HA (12CA5) and anti-His6 were from BAbCo; anti-P-ERK, anti-ERK, and anti-JNK antibodies were from New England Biolabs; polyclonal antibodies against ALK7 (RQC), Smad1, phospho-Smad1, Smad2, phospho-Smad2, Smad3, and Smad7 have been previously described (9Rydén M.

For JNK in vitro kinase assays, total cell lysates were incubated with glutathione-Sepharose beads that had been previously loaded with a purified c-Jun-glutathione S-transferase fusion protein (Upstate Biotechnology). After three washings in lysis buffer, the beads were further washed once in 0.1 m Tris, pH 7.5, 5 mm LiCl and once in kinase buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, 20 mm MgCl2, 1 mm Na3VO4, 20 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 2 mm dithiothreitol) and then incubated at 37 °C for 20 min in 30 μl of kinase buffer containing 2 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, 20 μm rATP, and 5 μm protein kinase A inhibitor. The reaction was stopped by adding SDS/β-mercaptoethanol sample buffer, and the samples were then boiled, fractionated by SDS-PAGE, and blotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The membranes were exposed to phosphorscreens and subsequently scanned in a STORM840 PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). JNK activity was quantified using ImageQuant software. After exposure, the membranes were probed with anti-JNK antibodies. Levels of PAI-1 were determined by SDS-PAGE of extracellular matrix proteins of metabolically labeled cells as previously described (19Franzen P. tenDijke P. Ichijo H. Yamashita H. Schulz P.

Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 972-978Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Nearly confluent 35-mm wells were stimulated with doxycycline at 1 μg/ml in full serum Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. After 24 h the cells were washed once in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and the medium was replaced with serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium without methionine and cysteine. After 2 h,35S-labeled methionine and cysteine (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech; PRO-MIX, SJQ0079) were added at 40 μCi/ml, and the cells were incubated for an additional 2 h. The cells were then removed by washing on ice once in PBS, three times in 10 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, two times in 2 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and once in PBS. SDS samble buffer containing β-mercaptoethanol were added, and the remaining extracellular matrix proteins on the plate were transferred to an Eppendorf tube for subsequent SDS-PAGE. After fixing in 40% methanol, 7% acetic acid, the gel was dried, and the 45-kDa PAI-1 band was visualized using a STORM840 PhosphorImager. Transcriptional response assays with luciferase reporters were analyzed using the Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System kit from Promega. Briefly, 6-well dishes of cells at 50% confluence were transfected as indicated above with 2 μg of the appropriate firefly luciferase reporter construct. For internal control of cell number and transfection efficiency, 50 ng ofRenilla luciferase under a minimal cytomegalovirus promoter (pRL-CMV, Promega) was included in the transfection. After transfection, full medium was added with or without doxycycline at 1 μg/ml, and the cultures were incubated for an additional 48 h before cell lysis as indicated by the manufacturer. Firefly luciferase activity was normalized to the Renilla luciferase activity, and fold induction was calculated relative to the luciferase activity in the absence of doxycycline for each reporter construct and cell line. Luciferase expression was quantified on a 1450 MicrobetaJet luminescence counter (Wallac). Proliferation assays were done on cells cultured on poly-d-lysine-coated 12-well plates at an density of 10 × 103 cells/well. For cell viability assays, 24 h after plating, cells were pulsed for 4 h with 2.0 μCi/ml [methyl-3H]thymidine (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), washed, and then incubated for an additional 48 h with or without doxycycline at 1 μg/ml. For DNA synthesis assays, the 4 h pulse with [methyl-3H]thymidine was done after the 48-h treatment with doxycycline. At the end of either type of experiment, the medium was replaced by 0.25% trypsin and 10 mm EDTA in PBS and, after a 30-min incubation at 37 °C, the cells were harvested onto filters mats using a cell harvester (Skatron Instruments). [3H]Thymidine incorporation was quantified on a 1450 Microbeta liquid scintillation counter (Wallac). F-actin was stained using a fluorescent phallotoxin from Molecular Probes (Alexa 488 phalloidin, A-12379) according to manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, cells were plated on poly-D-lysine-coated chamber slides (Lab-Tek) and left to attach overnight. The medium was then changed according to the experimental parameters, and the cells were incubated for additional 4.5 days before washing twice with PBS and fixing in 3.7% formaldehyde solution in PBS for 10 min at room temperature. After two additional washes in PBS, each slide was stained at room temperature for 20 min with one unit of Alexa 488 phalloidin in PBS. Following the staining, the slides were washed twice in PBS and mounted under a coverslip in a 1:1 solution of PBS and glycerol and examined by fluorescence microscopy. Morphological studies were performed in PDL-coated 6-well tissue culture plates in a similar fashion. Cells were always washed with PBS in between changes of medium to avoid carry over. For neuronal differentiation, NGF (Promega) was used at 50 ng/ml in low serum medium (i.e. 120th of its normal strength). Cultures were examined and photographed under phase contrast illumination in a Zeiss Axiovert microscope. In the absence of the ALK7 ligand and its corresponding type II receptor partner, an alternative system was developed to study the downstream signaling mechanism and potential biological activities of the ALK7 receptor. Type I receptor serine/threonine kinases can be activated in a ligand- and type II receptor-independent way by replacing an acidic residue for a specific threonine within the juxtamembrane region of the intracellular domain, a segment known to be involved in kinase regulation (21Wieser R. Wrana J.L. Massagué J. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2199-2208Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar). An equivalent mutation in the ALK7 receptor, corresponding to replacement of Asp for Thr194 (T194D), also results in constitutive activation of ALK7 as evaluated using TGF-β-specific reporter assays (10Tsuchida K. Sawchenko P.E. Nishikawa S.I. Vale W.W. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 1996; 7: 467-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). 2H. Jörnvall, A. Blokzijl, P. ten Dijke, and C. F. Ibáñez, unpublished results. Signaling by TGF-β ligands is known to have profound effects on cell proliferation, survival, and differentiation. To avoid potential problems caused by constitutive signaling during clone expansion and to allow the study of acute effects of ALK7 signaling, an inducible expression system based on the tetracycline-responsive operon (14Gossen M. Freundlieb S. Bender G. Müller G. Hillen W. Bujard H. Science. 1995; 268: 1766-1769Crossref PubMed Scopus (2027) Google Scholar) was utilized to generate stable cell lines. As a cellular host for inducible expression of constitutively active ALK7, we chose the rat pheochromocytoma PC12. This cell line has been extensively used as model system in studies of signal transduction, primarily because of its ability to develop a striking neuronal phenotype upon treatment with NGF (22Greene L.A. Tischler A.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 73: 2424-2428Crossref PubMed Scopus (4839) Google Scholar). For comparison with a better characterized signaling system, we also generated PC12 cells with inducible expression of a constitutively active form of the TGF-β type I receptor ALK5, generated, as previously described, by replacement of Asp for Thr204(T204D) (21Wieser R. Wrana J.L. Massagué J. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2199-2208Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar). A C-terminal His6 tag was placed in ALK7, and a C-terminal HA tag was placed in ALK5. It should be noted that parental PC12 cells do not express ALK7 and express only moderate levels of endogenous ALK5 (data not shown). Under basal conditions, ALK7-PC12 or ALK5-PC12 cells did not express any detectable levels of the introduced ALK7 or ALK5 receptors, respectively (Fig. 1). However, treatment with the tetracycline analogue doxycycline resulted in a marked increase in the expression of the respective receptors (Fig. 1). Induction of ALK7 mRNA expression was dose-dependent over a wide range of doxycycline concentrations (Fig. 1 A), with a peak 8 h after doxycycline treatment followed by a slow decline (Fig. 1 B). Expresion of ALK7 and ALK5 protein could be first detected 4 h after doxycycline stimulation and was maximal at 24 h (Fig. 1 C). The delay observed between the time course of induction of protein and mRNA expression following Dox treatment is unclear and could be due to differences in the sensitivity of the two methods. As shown below, several ALK7-induced signaling events can be detected as early as 3 and 6 h following Dox treatment, indicating that levels of ALK7 protein must in fact be present at these early time points. Expression of the exogenous receptors declined 5 days after uninterrupted doxycycline treatment, perhaps because of autoinhibition following continuous signaling (data not shown). A universal signal transduction event following activation of ALK receptors is the phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of members of the Smad protein family. Phosphorylation and nuclear accumulation of receptor specific Smads after ALK7 activation was investigated in nuclear fractions of ALK7- and ALK5-PC12 cells treated with doxycycline using specific antibodies for Smad1, Smad2, and Smad3. Activation of ALK7 resulted in phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of Smad2 but not Smad1 (Fig.2 A). Smad3 was also found to accumulate in the nuclei of ALK7-PC12 cells treated with doxycycline (Fig. 2 A). Similar results were obtained in ALK5-PC12 cells in agreement with previous observations. In agreement with the kinetics of ALK receptor expression, activation of Smad2 and Smad3 could first be detected 3 h after doxycycline stimulation and was maximal at 24 h (Fig. 2 A). We also looked for activation of the MAP kinases ERK and JNK in ALK7- and ALK5-PC12 cells after doxycycline treatment. Increased phosphorylation of ERK1 and ERK2 could be detected 6 and 12 h following doxycycline stimulation in both ALK7- and ALK5-expressing cells (Fig. 2 B). Using a c-Jun-glutathioneS-transferase fusion protein as substrate, we assayed the activity of JNK in cell lysates of ALK7- and ALK5-PC12 cells after doxycycline treatment. JNK activity was significantly elevated in both cell lines after 12 h of doxycycline treatment (Fig.2 B). Thus, in agreement with the structural similarity between the kinase domain of ALK7 and those of the TGF-β and activin receptors ALK5 and ALK4, signal transduction by the ALK7 receptor also utilizes the pathway-specific Smads 2 and 3, as well as the MAP kinases ERK and JNK. Downstream transcriptional responses to ALK7 signaling were investigated using the luciferase reporter gene coupled to regulatory elements from different genes known to be responsive to TGF-β superfamily proteins, including the genes of cycline-dependent kinase (cdk) inhibitors p15INK4B (23Li J.M.

Zentella A. Massague J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1573-1581Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), four tandem copies of the Smad-binding element from the Jun-B gene ((SBE)4) (26Jonk L. Itoh S. Heldin C.H. ten Dijke P. Kruijer W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21145-21152Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar), AP-1 elements, and nine tandem copies of the Smad-binding element from the PAI-1 promoter (CAGA)9 (27Dennler S. Itoh S. Vivien D. ten Dijke P. Huet S. Gauthier J.M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3091-3100Crossref PubMed Scopus (1578) Google Scholar). (SBE)4 is activated by both TGF-β/activin and BMP ligands, whereas (CAGA)9 is only activated by Smad3-mediated signaling (27Dennler S. Itoh S. Vivien D. ten Dijke P. Huet S. Gauthier J.M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3091-3100Crossref PubMed Scopus (1578) Google Scholar). ALK7-PC12, ALK5-PC12, and parental PC12 cells were transiently transfected with reporter plasmids, and reporter gene activity was assayed in cell lysates 48 h following doxycycline treatment. ALK7 signaling stimulated transcription from all the reporters (Fig. 3 A). Similar results were obtained in an independently isolated ALK7-PC12 cell clone (data not shown). With the exception of the p21 cyclin inhibitor reporter, which appeared down-regulated after doxycycline treatment, similar results were also observed in ALK5-expressing cells (Fig. 3 B). No changes were detected in parental PC12 cells after doxycycline stimulation (data not shown). Thus, with the possible exception of p21, ALK7 signaling resembles that of the type I TGF-β receptor ALK5 in PC12 cells, including the robust activation of the Smad3-specific reporter (CAGA)9. We also investigated whether ALK7 is able to regulate endogenous genes known to be targets of TGF-β and Activin signaling pathways. Expression of the inhibitory Smad7 is induced by TGF-β via direct interaction of Smad3 and 4 with the smad7 gene promoter (17Nakao A. Imamura T. Souchelnytskyi S. Kawabata M. Ishisaki A. Oeda E. Tamaki K. Hanai J. Heldin C.-H. Miyazono K. ten Dijke P. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5353-5362Crossref PubMed Scopus (906) Google Scholar). In PC12 cells, ALK7 activation induced expression of Smad7 with a peak of protein expression between 12 and 24 h following Dox treatment (Fig.4 A), indicating that, similar to other TGF-β family members, ALK7 signaling is also regulated through a feedback loop of inhibitory Smad proteins. Expression of immediate early genes is also regulated by TGF-β signaling, and the fact that activation of ALK7 induced phosphorylation of Erk proteins prompted us to examine the levels of c-fos mRNA in these cells. Doxycycline stimulation stimulated c-fos mRNA levels in ALK7-PC12 with a peak at 24 h of treatment, declining back to basal levels by 72 h (Fig. 4 B). Finally, we examined the expression of PAI-1, an extracellular matrix component which is up-regulated by TGF-β and activin in several cell types (19Franzen P. tenDijke P. Ichijo H. Yamashita H. Schulz P. Heldin C.H. Miyazono K. Cell. 1993; 75: 681-692Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (715) Google Scholar). We found that in ALK7-PC12 cells treated with doxycycline, the levels of PAI-1 were elevated compared with untreated cells (Fig.4 C), indicating that ALK7 activation regulates target genes responsible for some of the phenotypic changes induced by TGF-β proteins. Thymidine incorporation experiments were performed to investigate the effects of ALK7 signaling on cell survival and proliferation. In the first set of experiments, the cells were pulsed at the beginning with [3H]thymidine for 4 h and then cultured for another 48 h in the presence or absence of doxycycline. Under these conditions, there was no change at t"
https://openalex.org/W2143128546,"Proliferative signals lead to the rapid and transient induction of the c-fos proto-oncogene by targeting the ternary complex assembled on the serum response element (SRE). Transactivation by both components of this complex, serum response factor (SRF) and the ternary complex factor Elk-1, can be potentiated by the coactivator CREB-binding protein (CBP). We report a novel interaction between the bromodomain of CBP, amino acids 1100–1286, and Elk-1. DNA binding and glutathioneS-transferase pull-down assays demonstrate that binding requires Elk-11–212 but not the C-terminal transactivation domain. Competition and antibody controls show that the bromocomplex involves both SRF and Elk-1 on the c-fos SRE and uniquely Elk-1 on the E74 Ets binding site. Interestingly, methylation interference and DNA footprinting analyses show almost indistinguishable patterns between ternary and bromocomplexes, suggesting that CBP-(1100–1286) interacts via Elk-1 and does not require specific DNA contacts. Functionally, the bromocomplex blocks activation, because cotransfection of CBP-(1100–1286) reduces RasV12-driven activation of SRE and E74 luciferase reporters. Repression is relieved moderately or strongly by linking the bromodomain to the N- or C-terminal transactivation domains of CBP, respectively. These results are consistent with a model in which CBP is constitutively bound to the SRE in a higher order complex that would facilitate the rapid transcriptional activation of c-fos by signaling-driven phosphorylation.

These results are consistent with a model in which CBP is constitutively bound to the SRE in a higher order complex that would facilitate the rapid transcriptional activation of c-fos by signaling-driven phosphorylation. mitogen-activated protein kinase calcium- and cAMP-responsive element serum response element v-sis-inducible element protein kinase A cAMP response element binding protein mitogen-activated protein kinase-activated protein kinase signal transducer and activator of transcription serum response factor ternary complex factor extracellular signal-regulated kinase stress-activated protein kinase CREB binding protein amino acid(s) Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium glutathione S-transferase polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis N-lauroyl sarcosine polymerase chain reaction bovine serum albumin wild type SRF-(90-245) c-fos AP1-like element One response of cells to extracellular stimuli is the activation of signaling pathways that lead to changes in gene expression mediating proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. A major messenger system to these downstream events is the various MAPK1 signaling pathways that play a key role in this response by the activation of immediate early genes like the proto-oncogene c-fos (1Karin M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 415-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). The c-fos promoter contains three major regulatory elements, the CaCRE, the SRE, and the SIE (2Treisman R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 205-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (1165) Google Scholar, 3Hipskind R.A. Bilbe G. Front. Biosci. 1998; 3: D804-D816Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The Ca2+ and cAMP-response element (CaCRE) can mediate activation by cAMP-PKA or Ca2+-calmodulin-dependent kinase signals, which lead to phosphorylation of the transcription factor CREB on Ser-133 (4Gonzalez G.A. Montminy M.R. Cell. 1989; 59: 675-680Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2064) Google Scholar). CREB is also targeted by MAPK cascades through the activation of MAPKAP kinases (5Xing J. Kornhauser J.M. Xia Z. Thiele E.A. Greenberg M.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1946-1955Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Tan Y. Rouse J. Zhang A. Cariati S. Cohen P. Comb M.J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4629-4642Crossref PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar). The v-sis-inducible element (SIE) is targeted through cytokine- and growth factor-driven STAT1 and -3 activation (7Darnell Jr., J.E. Science. 1997; 277: 1630-1635Crossref PubMed Scopus (3400) Google Scholar), and their activity can be modulated by the MAPKs. The serum response element (SRE) on the c-fos promoter alone is sufficient to confer a signal-dependent activation (8Treisman R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4905-4913Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). Genomic footprinting studies have shown that a complex is assembled over this promoter before, during, and after induction (9Herrera R.E. Shaw P.E. Nordheim A. Nature. 1989; 340: 68-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). A complex with similar characteristics can be reproduced on the SRE in vitro by a dimer of serum response factor (SRF) and one molecule of ternary complex factor (TCF) (10Shaw P.E. Schroter H. Nordheim A. Cell. 1989; 56: 563-572Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). The TCFs are encoded by a family of Ets proteins that includes Elk-1, SAP-1a, and a third member variously called NET, ERP, or SAP-2 (11Treisman R. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1994; 4: 96-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar). Elk-1 and Sap-1a play a key role in translating signals from kinases into transcriptional activation. The TCFs represent major nuclear targets for the MAPKs ERK, p38, and SAPK. The resulting phosphorylation of TCF plays a major role in the induction of the c-fos gene by a mechanism that remains to be fully resolved (2Treisman R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 205-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (1165) Google Scholar). SRE-driven transcriptional activation appears to involve coactivators of the CBP/p300-family. CBP has been described to interact with the C-terminal transactivation domains of the TCFs Elk-1 and Sap-1a and with full-length SRF (12Janknecht R. Nordheim A. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 1961-1969PubMed Google Scholar, 13Janknecht R. Nordheim A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 228: 831-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 14Ramirez S. Ait-Si-Ali S. Robin P. Trouche D. Harel-Bellan A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31016-31021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). This involves the CBP region spanning aa 451–721 for TCF (12Janknecht R. Nordheim A. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 1961-1969PubMed Google Scholar, 13Janknecht R. Nordheim A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 228: 831-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar) and the N-terminal CBP region spanning aa 1–1097 for SRF (14Ramirez S. Ait-Si-Ali S. Robin P. Trouche D. Harel-Bellan A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31016-31021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Accordingly, CBP increases transcriptional activation by Elk-1, SAP-1a, and SRF in transient transfection assays (12Janknecht R. Nordheim A. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 1961-1969PubMed Google Scholar, 13Janknecht R. Nordheim A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 228: 831-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 14Ramirez S. Ait-Si-Ali S.

Chem. 1998; 273: 28564-28567Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Thus, SRE-driven transcriptional activation appears to involve the recruitment of CBP to the ternary complex, as has also been observed for the CREB·CaCRE and STAT·SIE c-fos promoter complexes (16Chrivia J.C. Kwok R.P. Lamb N. Hagiwara M. Montminy M.R. Goodman R.H. Nature. 1993; 365: 855-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (1770) Google Scholar, 17Zhang J.J. Vinkemeier U. Gu W. Chakravarti D. Horvath C.M.

Rosenfeld M.G. Glass C.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1074-1079Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). The kinetics of c-fos transcriptional induction suggest that the recruitment of the coactivator is either a very rapid process or that the coactivator is already present on the promoter. Here we have tested the latter possibility, namely that CBP might interact constitutively with the complex assembled over the SRE. We show that the bromodomain of CBP interacts with the TCF Elk-1 in solution and generates an Elk-1-dependent quaternary complex in vitro on the SRE. A similar Elk-1-dependent complex forms on the E74 site bound directly by Elk-1. Moreover, this novel complex represses transcriptional activation of SRE and E74 reporter genes driven by RasV12, whereas activity is restored by including the C- and N-terminal activation domains of CBP. These data suggest a model where the bromodomain anchors CBP to the SRE via TCF in a higher order complex. This would facilitate the rapid transcriptional activation of c-fos mediated by CBP through interaction with transcription factors targeted by signaling-driven phosphorylation. Restriction enzymes were obtained from Life Technologies and New England BioLabs. Antibodies against the DNA binding domain of Gal4 were purchased from CLONTECH and Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., rat monoclonal antibodies to hemagglutinin were from Roche Molecular Biochemicals, and the Elk-1 antibody against the Ets domain (aa 1–82) of Elk-1 (α-Ets) and the SRF antibody (NOP-13) have been described previously (19Zinck R. Hipskind R.A. Pingoud V. Nordheim A. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2377-2387Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 20Hipskind R.A. Rao V.N. Mueller C.G. Reddy E.S. Nordheim A. Nature. 1991; 354: 531-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). Horseradish peroxidase-coupled secondary antibodies were from Sigma-Aldrich. Glutathione-Sepharose, poly (dI-dC)·(dI-dC), ECL-plus nitrocellulose membranes, and the T7 DNA polymerase sequencing kit were purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, whereas Talon metal-affinity resin came from CLONTECH. Transfast transfection reagent, a TnT-coupled in vitro transcription translation kit, Taq DNA polymerase, and the Dual Luciferase kit were purchased from Promega. Radioisotopes, ECL reagents, and polyvinylidene difluoride were obtained from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Immobilon-P polyvinylidene difluoride membrane was from Millipore. DMEM and Dulbecco's PBS and FBS were purchased from Life Technologies. X-ray films and intensifying screens were purchased from Kodak, and B-Per reagent was purchased from Pierce. Nucleobond AX plasmid purification cartridges and the NucleoSpin extract kit were obtained from Machery-Nagel, and Jetstar plasmid cartridges came from Q-biogene. Protease and phosphatase inhibitors were from Sigma; all other ultra-pure biochemicals were from AppliChem (Darmstadt, Germany). The Gal4-CBP and GST-CBP subclones have been previously described (12Janknecht R. Nordheim A. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 1961-1969PubMed Google Scholar, 13Janknecht R. Nordheim A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 228: 831-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). The Gal4-CBP-(1–1460) construct was generated by insertion of the N-terminal portion of CBP into theSal I and Nar I sites of the Gal4-CBP-(1100–1460) subclone. The Gal4-CBP-(1100–2441) construct was generated by insertion of the C-terminal fragment of CBP into the Bam HI and Nar I sites of the Gal4-CBP-(1100–1460) subclone. The Elk-1 expression vector used for in vitro transcription (aa 1–428) was previously described (21Janknecht R. Nordheim A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 3317-3324Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). The Elk-1 N-terminal (aa 1–308) and C-terminal aa (Δ14–308) expression vectors for in vitro transcription were generated by digesting the corresponding bacterial expression constructs and subcloning them into the pCal-n vector (Stratagene). The 3xSRE-, 1xEL-, and 3xEL-fos TATA-luciferase reporter genes were kindly provided by G. Bilbe (Novartis Pharma, Basel, Switzerland). The 4xE74-fos TATA-luciferase reporter construct was generated in this vector by inserting anNot I-Spe I fragment containing four tandem copies of the E74 sequence (21Janknecht R. Nordheim A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 3317-3324Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). The RasV12 and SV40 renilla luciferase expression vectors were kindly provided by A. Philips (Institut de Génétique Moléculaire de Montpellier, Montpellier, France) and a CBPwt expression vector by R. Janknecht (Department of Biochemistry, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN). The original mouse CBPwt expression vector used for the GST- and Gal4-CBP constructs (12Janknecht R. Nordheim A. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 1961-1969PubMed Google Scholar, 13Janknecht R. Nordheim A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 228: 831-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar) contained a stop codon after aa 1286 leading to truncated proteins from the original clones spanning this region. Therefore the vectors originally described as GST-CBP-(1100–1460) and Gal4-CBP-(1100–1460) actually express a protein containing CBP amino acids 1100–1286 and are labeled accordingly. Plasmids were purified using cartridge systems forin vitro manipulations and by double banding in CsCl for transfections. The oligos 5′-AGTCGAATTCGAGGAGCTACGCCAGGCACTTATGC-3′ (upper strand) and 5′-AGCTAAGCTTCTAAGACTGCATGACAGGGTCAATT-3′ (lower strand) were used to generate a fragment of CBP spanning the bromodomain (aa 1089–1196) flanked by Eco RI and Hin dIII sites to facilitate cloning into expression vectors. The 25-μl PCR reactions contained 2 ng of CBPwt expression vector, 300 nm of each oligonucleotide, 200 nm dNTPs, 1.5 mm MgCl2, the supplier's reaction buffer (Promega), and 5 units of Taq polymerase. After 4 min at 95 °C, amplification was carried out for 24 cycles (0.5 min, 95 °C; 0.5 min, 55 °C; 0.5 min, 72 °C). The fragments were purified using a NucleoSpin extract kit, digested with Eco RI and Hin dIII, and then purified from an agarose gel using the NucleoSpin kit. After cloning into Bluescript KS+ (Stratagene), positive clones were confirmed by sequencing. The bromodomain-encoding fragment was recloned into pGEX-2T-6His and clones screened for expression of the GST-bromo fusion protein, as well as into pCDNA3.1-FLAG. This vector was used to confirm bromodomain expression by coupled in vitro transcription translation (see below). Escherichia coli strain BL21(LysE) was electroporated with the appropriate expression vector. Fresh colonies were used to inoculate 200-ml bacterial cultures, which were grown at 37 °C, and recombinant protein expression induced in exponential phase by adding isopropyl thiogalactoside to 0.1 mm. After 1–4 h at 37 °C, bacteria were collected by centrifugation and lysed in 10 ml of B-Per reagent according to the supplier's recommendations. Insoluble proteins were removed by centrifugation at 27,000 ×g for 15 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was brought to 1 mm imidazole and incubated overnight with 50–200 μl of Talon resin at 4 °C. The mix was poured into a column, the resin was washed twice with 5 ml of RJD* buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 5 mm MgCl2, 50 mm NaCl, 17% glycerol, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 0.05% Nonidet P-40) containing 1 mmimidazole and freshly added protease inhibitors (2.5 μg/ml aprotinin, leupeptin, pepstatin, 0.5 mm benzamidine, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Recombinant His-tagged proteins were eluted with two column volumes of RJD* buffer containing 200 mm imidazole, pH 7.6, and stored in aliquots at −70 °C. 35S-Labeled Elk-1 proteins were synthesized from Bluescript KS+ vectors encoding Elk-1-(1–428), Elk-1-(1–307), or Elk-1-(308–428) by coupled in vitro transcription/translation in the presence ofl-[35S]methionine (1000 Ci/mmol) using TnT kits according to the supplier's recommendations. C-terminal truncated proteins were produced identically, using the Elk-1-(1–428) vector digested with the following restriction enzymes: Xba I (Elk-1-(1–428)), Bsm I (Elk- 1-(1–374)), Apa I (Elk-1-(1–253)), Stu I (Elk-1-(1–212)), and Nsp I (Elk-1-(1–122)). Recombinant proteins purified by metal affinity chromatography were directly bound to glutathione-Sepharose beads at 4 °C for 1 h. The beads were then washed three times with a 100-fold excess of RJD*-buffer containing protease inhibitors and stored short-term at 4 °C. 5 μl of the in vitro translated Elk-1 proteins described above were added to 10 μl of a 50% slurry of protein-bearing beads in a total volume of 100 μl of RJD* buffer containing protease inhibitors and incubated with gentle agitation at 4 °C for 4 h. After three washes with 500 μl of RJD*, the beads were collected, resuspended in 20 μl of 5× Laemmli buffer (0.25 m Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 10% SDS, 10% glycerol, 5% 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.001% bromphenol blue) and denatured for 5 min at 95 °C, and the bound proteins were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Proteins were visualized by Coomassie Blue staining, followed by autoradiography of the dried gels. Proteins were subjected to electrophoresis on 6–10% SDS-PAGE minigels. Proteins larger than 100 kDa were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes by immersion blotting, whereas smaller proteins were immobilized on either nitrocellulose or polyvinylidene fluoride membranes by semi-dry transfer. Membranes were blocked with 5% dry milk in TBST (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 140 mm NaCl, 3 mm KCl, and 0.05% Tween 20) and then incubated with the indicated primary antibody diluted 1:1000 into the blocking buffer. After washing in TBST (6 × 5 min), the membranes were incubated with the appropriate secondary antibody coupled to horseradish peroxidase diluted in blocking buffer. The membranes were again washed in TBST as above, and the immune complexes were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence. NIH3T3 cells were maintained in DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Cells were seeded to 30% confluency in 6-well plates 16 h prior to transfection. The medium was changed 1 h before transfection, which was performed using a classical Ca2PO4 protocol (22Philips A. Chambeyron S. Lamb N. Vie A. Blanchard J.M. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6222-6232Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The transfection mixes contained 300 ng of Luciferase reporter construct, 1 μg of Gal4-CBP expression vector, 200 ng of RasV12 expression vector, 5 ng of pSV-Renilla Luciferase expression vector, and 3.5 μg of pUC18. These optimal values were determined experimentally several times. Cells were washed in phosphate-buffered salt solution 8–10 h after transfection and maintained in serum-free DMEM for 40 h. Cell extracts were prepared, and luciferase activity was determined following the protocol supplied with the Dual Luciferase kit (Promega). Measurements were made in duplicate using a Berthold Lumat LB950. For protein overexpression, COS-7 cells were transfected using Transfast (Promega) according to the supplier's protocol, and whole cell extracts were prepared as described (23Hipskind R.A. Baccarini M. Nordheim A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6219-6231Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined using Bradford's reagent with BSA as a standard. Protein expression was confirmed using immunoblotting prior to gel retardation analyses. Probes for binding analyses were prepared from subcloned SRE (20Hipskind R.A. Rao V.N. Mueller C.G. Reddy E.S. Nordheim A. Nature. 1991; 354: 531-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar), EL (10Shaw P.E. Schroter H. Nordheim A. Cell. 1989; 56: 563-572Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar), and E74 sequences (21Janknecht R. Nordheim A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 3317-3324Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) by Klenow enzyme-catalyzed end labeling of anEco RI-Nar I fragment in the presence of 50 μCi of [α-32P]dATP (3000 Ci/mmol, 10 μCi/μl) and 300 μm dTTP (23Hipskind R.A. Baccarini M. Nordheim A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6219-6231Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). The labeled fragments were purified from acrylamide gels by electroelution. The gel retardation experiments were carried out as previously described (23Hipskind R.A. Baccarini M. Nordheim A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6219-6231Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). In brief, reactions (7.5 μl) contained 4 fmol of labeled probe, a salt/protein/buffer mix, 2.5 μg of poly (dI-dC)·(dI-dC), recombinant coreSRF-(90–245) with SRE probes, and the proteins indicated in the figures. Where appropriate, 0.5–1 μl of antibodies was added to the reaction before the addition of protein extracts. After incubation for 30 min at room temperature, complexes were resolved on a 5% polyacrylamide gel containing 0.5× TBE at 1 mA/cm for 4 h. Complexes were visualized by autoradiography and phosphorimaging of the dried gel. SRE probes were prepared from the same site described above but cloned into pUC18 at theXba I site. After digestion withHin dIII-Xma I, the upper and lower strands were end-labeled using Klenow enzyme, 300 μm dGTP, and either 50 μCi of [α-32P]dATP (3000 Ci/mmol, 10 μCi/μl) for the Hin dIII end or 50 μCi of [α-32P]dCTP (3000 Ci/mmol, 10 μCi/μl) for theXma I end. The gel-purified fragment was treated for 3.5 min at 22 °C with 1% dimethyl sulfate in 60 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA. Reactions were stopped as described previously (24Maxam A.M. Gilbert W. Methods Enzymol. 1980; 65: 499-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (9014) Google Scholar), and the probes were subjected to several rounds of alcohol precipitation. Binding reactions were prepared and analyzed as for gel retardation analysis except that all components were increased 5-fold. The complexes were visualized by autoradiography of the wet gel. Regions of the gel corresponding to different complexes and free DNA were electrotransferred to DEAE paper (NA45, Schleicher and Schuell) and eluted in 0.5 m NaCl, 0.5% SDS, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.5 μg/ml Proteinase K at 65 °C. The eluted fragments were purified by organic extraction followed by ethanol precipitation. The fragments were incubated for 40 min at 95 °C in freshly made 1 m piperidine, and the piperidine was removed by multiple rounds of lyophilization and resuspension in H2O. The samples were finally resuspended in formamide dye mix (0.3% each bromphenol blue and Xylene Cyanol FF; 10 mm EDTA, pH 7.5, 80% deionized formamide), denatured for 5 min at 95 °C, and analyzed by denaturing electrophoresis in a 10% polyacrylamide-8.5 m urea sequencing gel. The gel was dried, and radioactivity was visualized by autoradiography at −70 °C with an intensifying screen and phosphorimaging as described above. Preparative reactions were carried out as described above but incubated for 30 min at 4 °C. Reactions were brought to 2.5 mm CaCl2, 7.5 mmMgCl2 were attained and incubated with 0.01 unit of DNaseI at 37 °C for 1.5 min. The reaction was terminated by adding 100 μl of 0.01% Sarkosyl, 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.1m NaCl, 0.02 mm EDTA, 0.03 μg/μl calf thymus DNA, and 0.075 μg/μl Proteinase K, incubated an additional 15 min at 37 °C followed by 5 min at 95 °C. Labeled DNA was purified by organic extraction and alcohol precipitation, resuspended in formamide dye mix, denatured again, and analyzed on 10% sequence gels as described above. To investigate the interactions between Elk-1 and CBP in detail, different subdomains of CBP were fused to the Gal4 DNA binding domain for expression in mammalian cells and to glutathione transferase to facilitate purification after overexpression in bacteria (12Janknecht R. Nordheim A. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 1961-1969PubMed Google Scholar, 13Janknecht R. Nordheim A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 228: 831-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). The different expression constructs are presented schematically in Fig.1 A. Immunoblotting with a Gal4-DNA binding domain antibody showed that the various fusion proteins were expressed at different levels after transient transfection of COS-7 cells (Fig. 1 B). Similarly, variable amounts of the various GST fusion proteins were obtained after affinity purification of bacterially expressed proteins (Fig. 1 C,lower panel). These assays were used to determine the functional protein concentration for subsequent experiments. It should be noted that the fusion proteins encoded by Gal4-CBP-(1100–1460) (12Janknecht R. Nordheim A. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 1961-1969PubMed Google Scholar,13Janknecht R. Nordheim A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 228: 831-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar) are truncated due to the presence of a stop codon after aa 1286 in the original CBP expression vector. Therefore, this protein contains the bromodomain of CBP but not the histone acetyltransferase domain immediately downstream and will subsequently be labeled CPB-(1100–1286). We first tested for solution interactions between various regions of CBP and Elk-1. Recombinant, bacterially produced GST-CBP fusion proteins were immobilized on glutathione-agarose beads and incubated with 35S-labeled Elk-1 (aa 1–428) produced by coupled in vitro transcription/translation (Fig.1 C). Two versions of Elk-1 are produced in vitro, the smaller of which arises from internal initiation of translation at Met-55 (also see below) (25Vanhoutte, P., Nissen, J. L., Brugg, B., Della Gaspera, B., Besson, M. J., Hipskind, R. A., and Caboche, J. (2000)J. Biol. Chem., in pressGoogle Scholar). Both full-length and N-terminal truncated Elk-1 bound to CBP-(451–721), which has previously been shown to interact with the C-terminal activation domain of Elk-1 (13Janknecht R. Nordheim A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 228: 831-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Full-length and N-terminal truncated Elk-1 also interacted with CPB-(1100–1286), which spans the bromodomain, and CBP-(1460–1891), which contains most of the histone acetyl transferase domain. The increased yield of the truncated version of Elk-1 versus that of full-length Elk-1, particularly in respect to their relative levels in the reaction input (left lane), suggests that these two CBP domains bound preferentially to N-terminal truncated Elk-1 in solution. Neither version of Elk-1 interacted with GST alone (Fig. 1 C) or with other domains of CBP (not shown), nor did we detect any binding of SRF produced in vitro to CBP (not shown). We then investigated the solution interaction between the bromodomain of CBP and different portions of Elk-1. To this end, in vitro translated 35S-labeled full-length (aa 1–428), N-terminal (aa 1–307), and C-terminal (aa 308–428) Elk-1 were used as above (Fig. 1 D). Similar to full-length Elk-1, the N-terminal construct gave rise to two translation products in vitro, unlike the C-terminal construct. This further supports the notion that the smaller form of Elk-1 arises from internal initiation of translation and not premature termination. Once again, full-length Elk-1 bound to the bromodomain of CBP in solution, as did Elk(NT), with some preference shown for the truncated version (compare bound lanes to input). CBP-(1100–1286) also interacted within vitro-translated C-terminal domain of Elk-1. Interestingly this interaction appears to be independent of its activation by phosphorylation, because Elk-(308–428) is not phosphorylated during in vitro translation. In contrast to these interactions, none of these proteins bound to GST alone (Fig.1 D). Thus we can detect complexes between multiple domains of CBP, in particular the bromodomain, and Elk-1 in solution. To confirm that the bromodomain alone (CBP aa 1089–1196) accounts for binding to Elk-1, an expression vector for GST-CBP-(1089–1196) was generated by PCR. This protein showed interactions with Elk(FL) and Elk(NT) that were indistinguishable from CBP-(1100–1286) (Fig.1 E) and in fact showed binding to progressively truncated versions of Elk until the region between amino acids 212 and 122 was deleted (Fig. 1 E). This indicates that the region in Elk-1 spanning aa 122 to 212 is important for interaction in solution with the CBP bromodomain. The interactions in solution between the bromodomain of CBP and the TCF Elk-1 led us to test for similar interactions in the context of DNA-bound complexes, using the E74 Ets sequence to which Elk-1 binds directly as a monomer (21Janknecht R. Nordheim A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 3317-3324Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). To this end we employed extracts from COS-7 cells, transiently transfected with expression vectors for different Gal4-CBP fusions, and analyzed complex formation on a 32P-labeled E74 oligonucleotide. Endogenous Elk-1 forms a characteristic complex in nontransfected cell extracts and those containing Gal4-CBP-(1–451) (Fig. 2 A, lanes 1 and 2). However, cell extracts"

Its main function in replication is proposed to be the removal of the displaced RNA-DNA primers synthesized by DNA polymerase α-primase during discontinuous lagging strand replication (reviewed in Ref. 1Bambara R.A. Murante R.S. Henricksen L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4647-4650Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). In DNA repair, Fen1 appears to be required for nonhomologous end joining of double-strand DNA breaks (2Wu X. Wilson T.E. Lieber M.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1303-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar) and for the removal of DNA base damage and single-strand breaks, likely through participation in the excision and resynthesis steps of long patch base excision repair and nucleotide excision repair (reviewed in Ref. 3Stucki M. Stagljar I. Jónsson Z.O. Hübscher U. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 2000; 65: 261-298Crossref Google Scholar). The relevance of these observations is underscored by in vivo data using yeast Fen1-null mutant strains that display severely impaired phenotypes such as temperature sensitivity for growth with a terminal phenotype consistent with a defect in replication, sensitivity for DNA damaging agents such as UV radiation, and alkylating agents and defects in telomere maintenance (4Murray J.M.

Because these deletion strains are strong mutators with destabilized repetitive sequences, it has been suggested that Fen1 might also be involved in one of the mechanisms by which trinucleotide expansions occur (8Gordenin D.A. Kunkel T.A. Resnick M.A. Nat. Genet. 1997; 16: 116-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 9Spiro C. Pelletier R. Rolfsmeier M.L. Dixon M.J. Lahue R.S. Gupta G. Park M.S. Chen X.

Chem. 2000; 275: 16420-16427Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Such expansions have been identified as the bases of more than 10 human hereditary diseases. In sum, Fen1 is a key enzyme for maintaining the genomic stability. The biochemistry of Fen1 has been studied extensively by several groups (reviewed in Ref. 11Lieber M.R. Bioessays. 1997; 19: 233-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar), and the crystal structures of two Fen1 orthologues from archaea have been solved (12Hosfield D.J. Mol C.D. Shen B. Tainer J.A. Cell. 1998; 95: 135-146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar, 13Hwang K.Y. Baek K. Kim H.-Y. Cho Y. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 707-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). The enzyme seems to employ a unique cleavage mechanism for substrates containing single stranded 5′ tails or flap structures. It cleaves the flap by recognizing the 5′ end, tracking the length of the tail and cleaving at the junction between double-stranded and single-stranded DNA (14Murante R.S. Rust L. Bambara R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30377-30383Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). The crystal structures of the archaea orthologues of Fen1 reveal a helical arch or clamp above the globular domain that contains the active site. This clamp forms a hole big enough for single-stranded but not for double-stranded DNA. This structure might be utilized by the nuclease to recognize and track down the 5′ end of a flap structure (13Hwang K.Y. Baek K. Kim H.-Y. Cho Y. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 707-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). DNA substrates containing nicks or small gaps are also cleaved exonucleolytically by Fen1. Although Fen1 acts less efficiently as an exonuclease than as a flap endonuclease, it is likely that the enzyme employs similar mechanisms for both reactions (11Lieber M.R. Bioessays. 1997; 19: 233-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). Eukaryotic Fen1 forms a stable complex with the replication accessory protein PCNA1 both in vitro and in vivo, and under physiological salt conditions PCNA can greatly stimulate the in vitro activity of Fen1 (15Jónsson Z.O. Hindges R. Hübscher U. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2412-2425Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar, 16Li X. Li J. Harrington J. Lieber M.R. Burgers P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22109-22112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar, 17Chen U. Chen S. Saha P. Dutta A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 2036-2043Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). The interaction domain was mapped to a region near the basic C terminus of Fen1, which contains a consensus motif similar to that found in several other replication and repair proteins that interact with PCNA (15Jónsson Z.O. Hindges R. Hübscher U. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2412-2425Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). Adjacent to the PCNA interaction motif at the very C terminus, Fen1 from eukaryotic species carries a basic tail of 35–38 amino acids of unknown function. This basic tail is absent in the solved x-ray structures of both archaea Fen1 orthologues. However, homologous basic tails are also present at the C termini of the XP-G structure-specific nucleases known to be involved in nucleotide excision repair (RAD2 of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Rad13 of Schizosaccharomyces pombe). Here, this domain seems to be important for nuclear localization and for dynamic response to UV radiation (19Park M.S. Knauf J.A. Pendergrass S.H. Coulon C.H. Strniste G.F. Marrone B.L. MacInnes M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8368-8373Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Consequently, it was suggested that in the case of Fen1, this domain might as well contain a nuclear localization signal that serves to translocate Fen1 into the nucleus where its activity is required (20Hosfield D.H. Shen B. Qiu J. Tainer J.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 171-173Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). In another report, it was proposed that the entire C-terminal part of Fen1 might be important for PCNA interaction (17Chen U. Chen S. Saha P. Dutta A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 11597-11602Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). In the present study, we have constructed two deletion mutants of human Fen1 lacking either the PCNA interaction motif or a part of its adjacent C-terminal region and analyzed these mutants in a variety of assays. Consistent with results of a very recent study (21Gomes X.V. Burgers P.M.J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3811-3821Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), we found that the PCNA interaction motif is indispensable for stimulation of Fen1 activity by PCNA. Moreover, our data reveal that the basic C-terminal tail is not important for PCNA interaction. However, this part of the protein is required for substrate binding. Our results indicate two functionally distinct regions within the C-terminal part of human Fen1 that might together form an important regulatory domain. Oligonucleotides for preparing the substrates for the Fen1 assays were purchased from Microsynth GmbH (Balgach, Switzerland). Ft2_01 is a 39-mer composed of 19 nucleotides complementary to nucleotides 698–717 of the plasmid pBluescript SK+ (pBS) and a 20-nucleotide noncomplementary tail. Ft2_05 is a 19-mer of the same sequence without the noncomplementary tail, and Ft2_02 is a 30-mer complementary to nucleotides 669–698 of single-stranded pBS. Oligonucleotides Ft2_01 and Ft2_05 were labeled at the 5′ end using [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase. Free ATP was removed on MicroSpinTM G-25 columns. To generate the substrates for the endo- and exonuclease assays, the appropriate primers were mixed with single-stranded pBS DNA in 1:1 molar ratio in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mmNaCl, heated to 75 °C, and slowly cooled to room temperature. The templates for the mobility shift assay were created by hybridizing 5′-labeled Ft2_01 or Ft2_05 and unlabeled Ft2_02 to a complementary 49mer oligonucleotide, corresponding to nucleotides 669–717 of pBS. Human Fen1 cDNA (gift of A. Dutta) was cloned into the pET23d vector (Novoagene). Deletion mutagenesis was performed with the QuickChangeTM site-directed mutagenesis kit from Stratagene according to the instruction manual. The following primers were used for the Fen1(ΔP) mutant (amino acids 337–344): 5′-AAGAGCCGCCAAGGCAGCACCAAGGTGACCGGCTCACTCT-3′ and 5′-AGAGTGAGCCGGTCACCTTGGTGCTGCCTTGGCGGCTCTT-3′. For the Fen1(ΔC) mutant (aa 360–380), oligos 5′-GCGCAAGGAGCCAGAAGGAAAGCTTGCGGCCG-3′ and 5′-CGGCCGCAAGCTTTCCTTCTGGCTCCTTGCGC-3′ were used, respectively. Wild type and mutant Fen1 were overexpressed in Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3)pLysS as histidine-tagged proteins and purified to homogeneity via Nickel charged metal chelating resin (HiTrap; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and fast protein liquid chromatography MonoS chromatography. Human PCNA was produced inE. coli using the plasmid pT7/hPCNA (gift from B. Stillman) and purified to homogeneity as described (22Schurtenberger P. Egelhaaf S.U. Hindges R. Maga G. Jónsson Z.O. May R.P. Glatter O. Hubscher U. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 275: 123-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Replication factor C (RF-C) was purified from nuclear extract of 60 g of harvested HeLa cells as described (23Hübscher U. Mossi R. Ferrari E. Stucki M. Jónsson Z.O. Cotterill S. Eukaryotic DNA replication: A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, Oxford1999: 119-137Google Scholar). Human replication protein A (RP-A) was overexpressed in E. coli strain BL21(DE3) harboring the expression plasmid p11d-tRP-A and purified according to Ref. 24Henricksen L.A. Umbricht C.B. Wold M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11121-11132Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar. The electrophoresis was performed in 8–25% polyacrylamide gels using the Phast System (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The gels were stained with Coomassie Blue. Interaction was measured as described (25Gary R. Kim K. Cornelius H.L. Park M.S. Matsumoto Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4354-4363Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Briefly, E. coli strain BL21(DE3)pLysS harboring either wild type or mutant Fen1 and PCNA expression plasmids was grown at 37 °C, and expression was induced. After harvesting by centrifugation, the cell pellets were resuspended in buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μmpepstatin A, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin) and briefly sonicated. The cell lysates were clarified by centrifugation. Binding assay mixtures (500 μl) contained 50 μl of 50% nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-Sepharose resin (Invitrogen), 150 μl of each cell lysate, and 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl to increase mixing efficiency. These mixtures were incubated for 90 min at 4 °C with constant gentle agitation and washed six times with 0.8 ml of buffer B (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 60 mm imidazole), and bound protein complexes were subsequently visualized on Coomassie-stained 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. The assays were performed in a final volume of 12.5 μl containing 40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 200 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 50 fmol of DNA substrate, 50 ng of RP-A, and indicated amounts of NaCl, ATP, PCNA, and RF-C. After addition of wild type or mutant Fen1, the reactions were incubated at 30 °C for 15 min and stopped with 2.5× stop buffer (95% formamid, 20 mm EDTA, 0.05% each bromphenol blue, and Xylene cyanol). Products were separated on 15% denaturing polyacryamid gels, visualized by autoradiography and quantified on a PhosphorImager using the ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics). Binding reactions were carried out as described (26Harrington J.J. Lieber M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4503-4508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Briefly, a total volume of 20 μl contained 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 10 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 50 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 50 fmol of labeled oligonucleotide template, and indicated amounts of wild type or mutant Fen1. After incubation at 20 °C for 10 min, reactions were loaded on 7% polyacrylamide gels containing 0.5× TBE and run at 50 V for 3 h. The gels were dried and exposed to x-ray films. The structures of archaea Fen1 reveal a saddle-shaped, single-domain α/β protein with a deep positively charged cleft along one face and an unusual “helical clamp” through which a single-stranded flap strand is likely threaded. The C-terminal nine residues extend away from the body of the enzyme (Fig.1 A and Refs. 12Hosfield D.J. Mol C.D. Shen B. Tainer J.A. Cell. 1998; 95: 135-146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar and 13Hwang K.Y. Baek K. Kim H.-Y. Cho Y. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 707-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). These residues are homologous to critical residues of eukaryotic proteins known to interact with PCNA (15Jónsson Z.O. Hindges R. Hübscher U. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2412-2425Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar), and, based on these data, a model of how Fen1 could be hooked to PCNA during DNA replication was proposed (12Hosfield D.J. Mol C.D. Shen B. Tainer J.A. Cell. 1998; 95: 135-146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). However, Fen1 from eukaryotic species have additional 35–38 residues at the C terminus that are not present in the archaea enzymes (Fig. 1 B). Chen and colleagues (17Chen U. Chen S. Saha P. Dutta A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 11597-11602Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) have deleted 17 residues at the very C terminus of human Fen1 and tested this mutant for its ability to interact with PCNA. Surprisingly, their mutant Fen1 failed to interact with PCNA in several assays, although it still contained an intact PCNA interaction motif. Thus, these C-terminal residues could be involved in PCNA interaction, or they could play another as yet unknown function. In a quest for Fen1 mutants that would differ from wild type Fen1 in their affinities for PCNA, we selectively deleted two regions at the C terminus of human Fen1. The first deletion comprised the entire PCNA interaction motif (amino acids 337–343) and was called Fen1(ΔP). The second deletion mutation, called Fen1(ΔC), enclosed the last 21 C-terminal amino acids (amino acids 360–380). Wild type and mutant Fen1 were overexpressed in E. coli as polyhistidine (His6)-tagged proteins and purified to homogeneity (Fig. 1 C). First, we tested whether the C-terminal tail of human Fen1 is involved in PCNA interaction. We have previously shown that the complex formed by PCNA and Fen1 is stable enough to survive electrophoresis on native gels (15Jónsson Z.O. Hindges R. Hübscher U. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2412-2425Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). The complexes appear as shifted bands on Coomassie-stained native gels (Fig.2 A). PCNA alone runs at about 67 kDa (lane 1), despite its actual mass of 86.3 kDa, reflecting the compactness of the trimer and the high overall negative charge of the protein. Fen1(WT) alone with an estimated pI of 8.78 does not enter the gel because of its net positive charge at pH 8.44 of the gel buffer, and the same is true for Fen1(ΔP) (lanes 2 and3). However, Fen1(ΔC) lacking several basic residues at the C terminus slowly enters the gel and appears between 170–180 kDa (lane 4). By separating a mixture of equimolar amounts of purified PCNA (as trimer) and Fen1(WT), a complex with a molar mass of 263 kDa was apparent (lane 5). Most likely, the high pI of Fen1 is responsible for the extent of the observed band shift. A similar shift appeared when equimolar amounts of PCNA and Fen1(ΔC) were separated, although in this case the complex ran at around 190 kDa (lane 6). However, when equimolar amounts of PCNA and Fen1(ΔP) were separated, no such band shift could be observed (lane 7). This suggests that Fen1(WT) and Fen1(ΔC) but not Fen1(ΔP) form complexes with PCNA that are stable enough to survive native PAGE. To confirm these findings, an affinity interaction assay was used to compare the PCNA binding activities of wild type and mutant Fen1. Lysates from bacteria expressing polyhistidine (His6)-tagged wild type and mutant Fen1 and untagged PCNA were mixed, and nickel-charged metal chelate resin was added to capture the His6-tagged Fen1 along with any associated PCNA (Fig.2 B). As expected, PCNA bound stably to Fen1(WT) and Fen1(ΔC) (lane 5 and 6) but not at all to Fen1(ΔP) (lane 7). The same results were obtained when His6-tagged PCNA was used to pull down untagged wild type and mutant Fen1, thus ruling out the possibility of a binding interference with the polyhistidine tag (data not shown). Taken together, these data suggested that the PCNA binding activity does not depend on the presence of the basic C-terminal tail of human Fen1, although a slight reduction in affinity cannot be ruled out. Fen1 cleaves endonucleolytically at branched DNA structures that have single-stranded 5′ flaps and exonucleolytically at nicks and, with lower efficiency, at gaps or recessed 5′ ends on double-stranded DNA. At low salt concentrations, Fen1 displays nuclease activity in the absence of its accessory protein PCNA. Wild type and mutant Fen1 nuclease activities were first determined in a flap cleavage assay in the absence of monovalent ions. The circular flap template was created as described in the experimental section and is documented in Fig.3 A. On this template, Fen1 cleaves at the junction of the flap releasing a labeled 20-mer fragment, which was quantitated by denaturing urea-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Fig. 3 A). Under low salt conditions, the activity of Fen1(WT) and Fen1(ΔP) was almost identical (Fig.3 A, lanes 2–4 and 5–7), whereas the activity of Fen1(ΔC) was clearly impaired (lane 8–10). Although 2.5 ng (60 fmol) of Fen1(WT) and Fen1(ΔP) cleaved 80 and 90% of the input template (50 fmol) in 15 min, respectively, the same amount of Fen1(ΔC) cleaved only about 8% of the template. Thus, at nonsaturating enzyme concentrations, Fen1(ΔC) is about 10 times less active than Fen1(WT) and Fen1(ΔP). Fen1(ΔC) displayed a reduced enzymatic activity even at highly saturating enzyme concentrations (25 ng; 0.6 pmol). Next, we tested whether the exonucleolytic activity of the mutant Fen1(ΔC) was impaired as well. Purified wild type and mutant Fen1 were examined on a circular partial duplex DNA molecule containing a nick (Fig. 3 B). Fen1 digests the upstream oligonucleotide exonucleolytically in the 5′ to 3′ direction, thus releasing a labeled 5′ mononucleotide, which could be resolved and quantitated on 15% urea polyacrylamid gels. As expected, Fen1(ΔC) exonucleolytic activity was also severely reduced (lanes 18–20). Again, the activities of Fen1(WT) and Fen1(ΔP) were almost identical (Fig. 3 B,lanes 12–14 and 15–17). Although 5 ng of (120 fmol) of Fen1(WT) and Fen1(ΔP) cleaved 84 and 81% of the input template (50 fmol) in 15 min, respectively, no detectable cleavage product could be observed when 50 fmol of the template was incubated with 5 ng of Fen1(ΔC). When the same amount of template was incubated together with 50 ng of Fen1(ΔC), only 24% were cleaved in 15 min. At these concentrations, Fen1(WT) and Fen1(ΔP) cleaved almost 100%. In summary, these data are in agreement with a recent study by Gomes and Burgers (21Gomes X.V. Burgers P.M.J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3811-3821Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) showing that a mutation within the PCNA-binding motif does not affect the nuclease activity of yeast Fen1 at low salt concentration. In addition, our data reveal that the PCNA independent endo- and exonucleolytic activities of a Fen1 mutant lacking the basic C-terminal tail are severely defective when compared with wild type activity. Endo- and exonucleolytic activities of Fen1 are inversely proportional to monovalent salt concentrations in the physiological range (27Harrington J.J. Lieber M.R. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1235-1246Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). However, it has been shown that PCNA can stimulate Fen1 activity up to 50-fold under physiological salt conditions (16Li X. Li J. Harrington J. Lieber M.R. Burgers P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22109-22112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar, 18Wu X. Li J. Li X. Hsieh C.L. Burgers P.M. Lieber M.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 2036-2043Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Kinetic analysis revealed that PCNA enhances Fen1 binding stability, thus increasing the cleavage efficiency (28Tom S. Henricksen L.A. Bambara R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10498-10505Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). To efficiently stimulate Fen1 activity, the PCNA trimer must encircle the DNA and must be located “below” the flap (15Jónsson Z.O. Hindges R. Hübscher U. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2412-2425Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). In our study, PCNA-dependent Fen1 activity was determined at 100 mm NaCl. Under these conditions, Fen1 alone is inactive (Fig. 4 A). For stimulation, the ATP-dependent clamp loader RF-C must be present to load PCNA at the flap junction and at the position of the nick, respectively, because PCNA cannot spontaneously load onto circular DNA molecules in the absence of RF-C. The human single-stranded DNA binding protein RP-A was also present in this assay to prevent nonproductive association of RFC to single-stranded DNA (29Keller R.C. Mossi R. Maga G. Wellinger R.E. Hübscher U. Sogo J.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 3433-3437Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). First, wild type and mutant Fen1 nuclease activities were determined in the presence of 100 mm NaCl (Fig. 4 B). Fen1(ΔP) was inactive, even at the highest concentration tested (lanes 5–7). This result is again in agreement with a recently characterized similar yeast Fen1 mutant (21Gomes X.V. Burgers P.M.J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3811-3821Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), although this mutant carrying two point mutations within the PCNA-binding motif shows weak activity at long incubation times. Fen1(ΔC) displayed some activity at higher concentrations, but this activity was also severely impaired compared with Fen1(WT) activity; in the presence of PCNA, as little as 0.05 ng (1.2 fmol) Fen1(WT) cleaved 85% of the input template in 15 min (lane 2), whereas the same amount of Fen1(ΔC) cleaved only 8.5% (lane 8). Remarkably, the difference between Fen1(WT) and Fen1(ΔC) activity seems to be the same as in the absence of PCNA, although in the PCNA independent assay, the enzyme concentration was 50-fold higher. When the PCNA-dependent exonucleolytic activity of wild type and mutant Fen1 was tested, Fen1(ΔP) was, as expected, completely inactive (lanes 15–17), and Fen1(ΔC) was about 10 times less active than Fen1(WT) (lanes 12–14and 18–20). In summary, Fen1(ΔP) is completely defective under PCNA-dependent conditions. Because this mutant is unable to form a complex with PCNA (Fig. 2), we conclude that the physical interaction between Fen1 and PCNA is absolutely required for Fen1 stimulation. Moreover, PCNA-dependent endo- and exonucleolytic activity of Fen1(ΔC) is as much reduced as the PCNA-independent activity, which suggests that the C-terminal tail has no influence on PCNA interaction and stimulation. Because Fen1(ΔC) activity was 10-fold reduced both in PCNA-independent and in PCNA-dependent nuclease assays, we next tested whether this mutant had a defect in substrate binding. To investigate the substrate binding characteristics of wild type and mutant Fen1, we employed the mobility shift assay developed by Harrington and Lieber (26Harrington J.J. Lieber M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4503-4508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Because Fen1 is a potent nuclease in the presence of divalent metal ions, EDTA was included in the binding reaction. The labeled binding substrates were created as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Fen1(WT) and Fen1(ΔP) were found to bind to both flap and nick substrates in a dose-dependent manner. At concentrations between 60 and 240 nm of Fen1, a single shifted species was observed (Fig.5, lanes 2–7 and12–17, respectively). However, when equal amounts of Fen1(ΔC) were incubated with the binding substrates, no detectable shift could be observed, indicating that this C-terminal mutant displayed a severe defect in substrate binding, suggesting that the reduced nuclease activity of this mutant is caused by a defect in the binding portion of the nucleolytic reaction. In this study, we have characterized two deletion mutants of human Fen1 lacking residues at the C terminus that have been proposed to be critical for interaction with PCNA. These mutants were compared with wild type Fen1 in a variety of assays. The mutant Fen1(ΔP) lacking 7 amino acids (amino acids 337–343) near the C terminus behaved very similarly to mutants recently characterized by other groups (21Gomes X.V. Burgers P.M.J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3811-3821Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 25Gary R. Kim K. Cornelius H.L. Park M.S. Matsumoto Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4354-4363Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). These studies and the data presented here provide a consistent body of evidence that the bimolecular interaction between these two proteins is mediated by a consensus PCNA-binding motif (QXX(M/I/L)XX F(F/Y)), which is present in several other proteins known to interact with PCNA including p21, XP-G and DNA ligase I. On the other hand, at least two regions within PCNA seem to mediate the interaction with Fen1, and the protein-protein contacts between Fen1 and PCNA are slightly different in solution from the contacts that occur when the proteins are complexed with DNA (15Jónsson Z.O. Hindges R. Hübscher U. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2412-2425Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar, 21Gomes X.V. Burgers P.M.J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3811-3821Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). The relevance of the PCNA/Fen1 interaction via the interaction motif is underscored by in vivo data using yeast strains with mutations within this conserved region (21Gomes X.V. Burgers P.M.J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3811-3821Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar,30Gary R. Park M.S. Nolan J.P. Cornelius H.L. Kozyreva O.G. Tran H.T. Lobachev K.S. Resnick M.A. Gordenin D.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5373-5382Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). In another report, it was suggested that the basic C-terminal tail of Fen1 was also important for the interaction with PCNA, because a deletion mutant lacking 17 amino acids at the C terminus failed to interact with PCNA, although this mutant still contained an intact PCNA interaction motif (17Chen U. Chen S. Saha P. Dutta A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 11597-11602Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). We have constructed a similar mutant, Fen1(ΔC), lacking 21 amino acids at the very C terminus and tested it for PCNA interaction in a native PAGE-based assay and in an affinity interaction binding assay. In our hands, no difference in the ability to interact with PCNA could be detected between this mutant and wild type Fen1, whereas the Fen1(ΔP) mutant was completely unable to interact with PCNA. This discrepancy may partially result from differences in the experimental design or alternatively the additional C-terminal residues on the Fen1 mutant of Chen et al. (17Chen U. Chen S. Saha P. Dutta A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 11597-11602Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) may affect the folding of the PCNA-binding motif so that it no longer can interact with PCNA. Our data, however, show that the short PCNA-binding motif of Fen1 is responsible for the bulk of the PCNA interaction. Consistent with this, we showed in this study that wild type Fen1 and the Fen1(ΔC) mutant were stimulated by PCNA to a relatively equal extent under physiological salt conditions. On the other hand, both the endo- and exonucleolytic activities of the mutant Fen1(ΔC) were significantly reduced compared with the wild type enzyme. This defect could be observed in a PCNA-dependent background, as well as under conditions where Fen1 displays activity without PCNA. We therefore conclude that this defect is not due to the inability of Fen1(ΔC) to interact with PCNA. Moreover, the ability of this mutant to associate with an oligo flap template and a short nicked double-stranded DNA was severely reduced. Our results clearly demonstrate the importance of the C-terminal basic tail for the binding portion of the nucleolytic reaction. Because the active site of the enzyme is composed of residues of the N-terminal and intermediate conserved regions (31Shen B. Nolan J.P. Sklar L.A. Park M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9173-9176Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 32Shen B. Nolan J.P. Sklar L.A. Park M.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3332-3338Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), it is rather unlikely that the C terminus is also involved in the cleavage portion of the enzymatic reaction. The simplest explanation for the defect in substrate binding of Fen1(ΔC) would be the lack of several positively charged residues (8 lysines and 1 arginine) that may specifically or unspecifically contact the negatively charged phosphate groups of the DNA backbone and contribute to the stability of the enzyme substrate complex. If this is true, then the question arises why such an “anchor” is not present in the archaea Fen1 orthologues, which have structure-specific mechanisms for DNA substrate binding and catalysis resembling the human enzyme (33Hosfield D.J. Frank G. Weng Y. Tainer J.A. Shen B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27154-27161Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Another even more interesting possibility would be that the C-terminal tail loops back toward the enzymatic center, thus providing structural elements that might modulate the stability of the enzyme substrate complex. We could recently show that Fen1 is an acetylated protein in vivo. 2S. Hasan, M. Stucki, P. O. Hassa, R. Imhof, U. Hübscher, and M. O. Hottiger, submitted for publication. This Fen1 acetylation is significantly increased after UV treatment of the cells and is most probably mediated by the histoneacetyl transferase domain of the transcriptional coactivator p300. There is a detectable interaction between these two proteins both in vitro andin vivo, which is mediated by the C-terminal tail of Fen1. Moreover, we showed that the acetylated Fen1 possessed a reduced enzymatic activity, thus resembling our Fen1(ΔC) mutant. Possibly, one or several lysine residues at the C-terminal tail are “neutralized” upon acetylation, which could lead to a destabilized enzyme-substrate complex, as shown here for the Fen1(ΔC) mutant. This model suggests that the C-terminal tail of eukaryotic Fen1 contains regulatory regions that are modified upon treatment of the cells with damaging agents. This modification might regulate the enzymatic activity itself or the subnuclear localization by modulating the DNA binding stability and/or specificity. In summary, our results suggest that the C terminus of eukaryotic Fen1 consists of two functionally distinct regions: one that mediates PCNA interaction, which is important for stimulation of enzymatic activity and/or targeting Fen1 to sites where its action is required, and a second region that functions in recognition of the DNA substrate. This second region is not present in archaea orthologues of Fen1. It therefore has been suggested that it might be required for nuclear localization of the enzyme in eukaryotes (20Hosfield D.H. Shen B. Qiu J. Tainer J.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 171-173Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 34Dingwall C. Laskey R.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1991; 16: 478-481Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1711) Google Scholar), although the importance of such a putative nuclear targeting signal for Fen1 has not been shown. Our data suggest that this basic C-terminal tail of eukaryotic Fen1 most likely has an additional function.

It exhibits a tripartite structure consisting of a head piece (F1 catalytic sector), base piece (F0, membrane sector), and two connecting stalks. F1 is a water-soluble unit retaining the ability to hydrolyze ATP. F0 is embedded in the membrane and is mainly composed of hydrophobic subunits forming a specific proton conducting pathway. The connecting stalks are composed of components from both F1 and F0. When F1 and F0 are coupled, the enzyme functions as a reversible H+-transporting ATPase or ATP synthase (1Pedersen P.L. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1996; 28: 389-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 2Weber J. Senior A.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1319: 19-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar).

InEscherichia coli, F1 and F0 are linked by two stalks, one of which is made of subunits γ and ε, and these also constitute a part of the rotor (7Aggeler R. Ogilvie I. Capaldi R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19621-19624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Three other subunits, δ of F1 and the two b-subunits of F0, are also involved in the binding of F1 to F0 and are thought to form the second stalk of the stator. The stator is thought to fix the α3β3oligomer to the a-subunit, thus allowing rotation of thec-subunit oligomer together with the γ- and ε-subunits. (8Zhou Y. Duncan T.M. Cross R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad.

The E. coli ATP synthase and the bovine enzyme are composed of 8 and 16 different subunits, respectively (11Collinson I.R. Runswick M.J. Buchana S.K. Fearnley I.M. Skehel J.M. van Raaij M.J. Griffiths D.E. Walker J.E. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7971-7978Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). In the case ofSaccharomyces cerevisiae, the F0F1-ATP synthase is composed of at least 13 different subunits involved in the structure of the enzyme; the disruption of any of the corresponding structural genes leads to a lack of assembly of the holo-complex (12Velours J. Paumard P. Soubannier V. Spannagel C. Vaillier J. Arselin G. Graves P.V. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1458: 443-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Recently, the establishment of the structure of the yeast enzyme at 3.9 Å resolution revealed the structure of the F1 and the subunit c oligomer of F0 (13Stock D. Leslie A.G.W. Walker J.E. Science. 1999; 286: 1700-1705Crossref PubMed Scopus (1093) Google Scholar). Among the supernumerary subunits of the yeast ATP synthase F0, subunit h has been described as an essential component because inactivation of the ATP14 gene led to a lack of oxidative phosphorylations (14Arselin G. Vaillier J. Graves P.V. Velours J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20284-20290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Recently cross-linking experiments (15Soubannier V. Rusconi F. Vaillier J. Arselin G. Chaingnepain S. Graves P.V. Schmitter J.M. Zhang J.L. Mueller D. Velours J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 15017-15024Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) have positioned this hydrophilic and acidic component of 10,408 Da close to subunit 4 (subunit b), a component of the second stalk of the ATP synthase. In this paper we report the complementation of a yeast strain devoid of the yeast ATP synthase subunit h by a single copy vector bearing a DNA sequence encoding the bovine coupling factor 6. This is a rather remarkable result because subunit h and bovine F6 share only 14.5% sequence identity. The S. cerevisiae strain D273–10B/A/H/U (MATα, met6, ura3, his3) (16Paul M.F. Guérin B. Velours J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 205: 163-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) was the wild type strain. The strain with the null mutation in ATP14 (MATα, met6,ura3, his3, ATP14::URA3) has been described (14Arselin G. Vaillier J. Graves P.V. Velours J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20284-20290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The ΔATP14 strain containing the plasmid pbF6, was obtained by transformation of the null mutant in ATP14 gene by the nonintegrative single copy vector, pRS313, which contains the coding region of mature bF6,1 the leader peptide of the β-subunit of the yeast ATP synthase, and the upstream and downstream transcriptional controlling elements of theATP2 gene. The expression plasmid for expression of bF6, pbF6, was made essentially as described (17Lai-Zhang J. Mueller D.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 2409-2418Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). In this scheme, the coding region of mature bF6 replaces the coding region of the gene encoding the β-subunit of the ATP synthase,ATP2. This allows the expression of bF6 to be under the same controls as that of the ATP2 gene. The coding region of bF6 is amplified by PCR, and this PCR fragment is used to directly replace the coding region of the ATP2 gene. The replacement occurs by site-specific homologous recombination effected in yeast. In addition to the bases required to direct the synthesis of the coding region of bF6, the PCR primers also contain a 30-base sequence that targets the PCR product to the desired site of recombination on the ATP2 gene, in this case at the end of the region coding for the leader peptide and at the 3′-untranslated part of the gene. Recombination is effected in vivo in yeast and occurs across a linearized plasmid (pRS314) (18Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) that contains the ATP2gene that is cut in the center (gap repair) (for a diagram of this method, see Ref. 17Lai-Zhang J. Mueller D.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 2409-2418Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The recombination event occurs at the region encoding the leader peptide, at one end, and at the stop codon of the coding frame of bF6 (a clone containing the cDNA for bovine F6 was kindly provided by Dr. John E. Walker, Cambridge, UK). In this manner, the coding region of mature bF6 precisely replaces the coding region of theATP2 gene. The DNA sequence of the chimeric gene was sequenced to ensure the correct recombination event and to ensure the absence of any mutations. DNA sequence analysis was performed at the Iowa State University sequencing facility (Ames, Iowa). The chimeric gene was removed from the plasmid by digestion with XbaI and SalI and subcloned into the low copy vector pRS313 at the same restriction sites (18Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The forward and reverse primers used in the PCR reaction were: bx_F6·pri: CTT CTA TCC ACT TCG TGG AAA AGA TGT ATGGCC TCA aat aag gag ctt gat cct gtg and bx_F6·rev·pri: CTT CCC TTG GTT TAA GCT TTA TTT CTT CTA gga ttg tgg ttt ctc gac, respectively. The lowercase letters correspond to the region that primes DNA synthesis in the PCR reaction using the cDNA of bF6 as the template. The capital letters correspond to the target site for homologous recombination in the plasmid containing the gene encoding the β-subunit of the F1-ATPase (ATP2). The underlined sequence corresponds to the additional Ala-Ser codons. These were added because it is frequently the case that Ala-Ser are the first two amino acids after the processing site of the leader peptide. The Ala-Ser are thus positioned after and adjacent to the leader sequence of what corresponds to the leader peptide of the β-subunit of the ATPase. Cells were grown aerobically at 28 °C in a complete liquid medium containing 2% lactate as carbon source (19Arselin de Chateaubodeau G. Guérin M. Guérin B. Biochimie ( Paris ). 1976; 58: 601-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) and harvested in logarithmic growth phase. Mitochondria were prepared according to (20Guérin B. Labbe P. Somlo M. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 55: 149-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar), frozen as droplets in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −70 °C. Protein amounts were determined according to Lowry et al. (21Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in the presence of 5% SDS using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Oxygen consumption rates were measured with NADH as substrate (22Rigoulet M. Guérin B. FEBS Lett. 1979; 102: 18-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Variations of transmembrane potential (ΔΨ) were evaluated by measurement of fluorescence quenching of rhodamine 123 with an SFM Kontron fluorescence spectrophotometer (23Emaus R.K. Grunwald R. Lemasters J.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 850: 436-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (732) Google Scholar). The specific ATPase activity was measured at pH 8.4 according to Somlo (24Somlo M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1968; 5: 276-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) and modified as follows. Freshly prepared mitochondria were diluted with the same volume of either the isolation buffer (0.6m mannitol, 2 mm EGTA, 10 mmTris-maleate, pH 6.8) or 0.75% Triton X-100 (w/v). Aliquots were taken for protein concentration measurement, and determination of ATPase activity was done as follows: mitochondrial protein (50 μg) was incubated for 2 min in reaction medium (0.9 ml, 0.2 m KCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.4) in the presence or absence of F0 inhibitors. The reaction was started with the addition of 5 mm ATP and stopped after 2 min by the addition of 0.3 m trichloroacetic acid. Mitochondrial Triton X-100 extracts were sedimented on sucrose gradients as follows. Mitochondrial protein (3 mg at 10 mg/ml) was incubated with an equal volume of 0.75% (w/v) Triton X-100. The extract was spun at 100,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was loaded on the top of a 10–30% linear sucrose gradient containing 0.1% Triton X-100, 1 mm ATP, 1 mm EDTA, and 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. The gradient was centrifuged at 4 °C for 17 h, 46 min in a SW41 rotor (Beckman) at 41,000 rpm, and fractions (1 ml) were collected and used for analysis. Frozen mitochondria isolated from wild type and mutant cells were thawed, washed twice with 0.6 m mannitol, 2 mm EGTA, 50 mmtriethanolamine-HCl, pH 8.0, and suspended in the same buffer at a protein concentration of 10 mg/ml. Samples were incubated for 30 min at 30 °C in the presence or absence of DSP dissolved in dimethylformamide, and the reaction was quenched by the addition of 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0. The ATP synthase was extracted with 0.375% (w/v) Triton X-100, and after incubation for 15 min at 4 °C, the extract was spun at 100,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was used for analysis. Bovine F6 was released from the ATP synthase (free bF6) by sonication as follows. Washed mitochondria from yeast,ΔATP14 + bF6 were suspended in 100 mm NaCl, 22 mm triethanolamine, pH 8.0, at a final concentration of 10 mg protein/ml and sonicated four times for 30 s at 120 V (Annemasse sonicator). The sample was centrifuged at 435,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. Aliquots of the supernatant containing free bF6 were incubated with DSP and analyzed either by Western blot or loaded on a 10–30% linear sucrose gradient, as described above. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was according to Schägger and Von Jagow (25Schägger H. Von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10505) Google Scholar). Nitrocellulose membranes (Membrane Protan BA83, 0.2 μm from Schleicher & Schuell) were used for Western blot analyses. The polyclonal antibodies, anti-bF6, were kindly provided by Dr. Youssef Hatefi (Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, CA) and used with a dilution of 1:7,500. Antibodies against subunit4 and the α-subunit were used with dilutions of 1:10,000 and 1:100,000, respectively. Membranes were incubated with peroxidase-labeled antibodies and visualized with the ECL reagent of Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Molecular mass markers (Benchmark Prestained Protein Ladder) were from Life Technologies, Inc. Sequence alignments were performed as in (26Risler J.L. Delorme M.O. Delacroix H. Henaut A. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 204: 1019-1029Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). Secondary structure predictions were made with the program at the PredictProtein Server. For expression in yeast, the cDNA encoding mature bF6 was fused to the leader sequence of the yeast β-subunit. In addition, the codons for Ala-Ser were added to the front end of the codons encoding the mature bF6, as described (17Lai-Zhang J. Mueller D.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 2409-2418Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The expectation is that leader sequence will be cleaved in front of the Ala-Ser residue after import into the mitochondrion providing an N-terminal sequence of: ASNKELD … The strain containing the null mutation in the ATP14 gene (14Arselin G. Vaillier J. Graves P.V. Velours J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20284-20290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), which encodes subunit h, was transformed by a single copy vector (pRS313) bearing the selection marker HIS3 and the DNA encoding the bovine F6, pbF6. The transformants were tested for growth on a complete medium containing glycerol as the sole carbon source, YPG (3% glycerol, 2% peptone, 1% yeast extract). Growth on medium containing glycerol or lactate indicates that the cells are able to make ATP via oxidative phosphorylation and thus have a functional ATP synthase. All of the transformants were able to grow on YPG at 28 °C but not at 37 °C (Fig. 1). One of the transformants was selected, named ΔATP14 + bF6, and this strain had a generation time of 300 min as compared with 164 min for the wild type strain, at 28 °C in liquid medium containing lactate as the carbon source. Loss of the plasmid, by growing the cells on a complete medium with glucose as carbon source, resulted in a concomitant loss in the ability to grow on glucose minimal medium devoid of histidine and on YPG medium (not shown). Thus, these results indicate a functional homology between yeast subunit h and bF6. Mitochondria were prepared from ΔATP14 + bF6 strain to examine the effectiveness of bF6 in replacing subunit h in the structure and function of the ATP synthase. Respiration rates were measured with NADH as substrate (Table I). In the presence of CCCP, the uncoupled respiration rates of mitochondria isolated from the wild type and ΔATP14 + bF6 strains were similar. The main difference between the two preparations is the respiration rate associated with the phosphorylation of ADP (State 3) where the respiration rate ofΔATP14 + bF6 mitochondria is only 51% of the uncoupled respiration rate, as compared with 63% for the wild type. As a result, the respiratory control and the ATP/O ratio ofΔATP14 + bF6 mitochondria are lower than those of wild type mitochondria, thus reflecting a lower ATP synthase activity and a lower efficiency of oxidative phosphorylation.Table IOxidative phosphorylation measurements of isolated mitochondriaMitochondriaRespiration ratesRespiratory controlATP/OCCCPState 4State 3nmol O/min/mg proteinWild type1199 ± 42302 ± 39759 ± 582.54 ± 0.401.09 ± 0.13ΔATP14 +bF 61090 ± 32314 ± 41561 ± 21.81 ± 0.240.80 ± 0.03D273–10B/A/H/U (wild type) and ΔATP14 +bF 6 mitochondria were prepared from cells grown in complete liquid medium containing 2% lactate as carbon source.

Data are from typical experiments. Measurements were performed four times. Respiration rates were obtained with NADH as substrate. CCCP concentration was 3 μm. At pH 8.4, the ATPase activity of ΔATP14 + bF6 mitochondria is partially inhibited by DCCD but not by oligomycin, both of which are inhibitors of F0(Table II). Addition of Triton X-100 (0.375%) solubilizes the ATP synthase and increases the ATPase activity of wild type mitochondria by removing IF1, the F1 inhibitor protein. This stimulation also occurred for the ΔATP14 + bF6 mitochondrial extract, but the sensitivity to DCCD was nearly abolished. These data suggest that the ATP synthase isolated from ΔATP14 + bF6 mitochondria was highly unstable, consistent with the temperature-sensitive phenotype of the cells on YPG medium (Fig.1).Table IIATPase activities of isolated mitochondriaStrainsControl+Oligomycin+DCCDnmol Pi/min/mg proteinWild type2696 ± 98243 ± 105285 ± 12Wild type + Triton X-1004985 ± 101669 ± 25669 ± 34ΔATP14 +bF 62699 ± 303154 ± 571487 ± 41ΔATP14 + bF 6 + Triton X-1006749 ± 1905765 ± 216348 ± 59D273–10B/A/H/U (wild type) and ΔATP14 +bF 6 mitochondria were prepared from yeast cells grown with 2% lactate as carbon source.

Samples treated in the presence or absence of 0.375% Triton X-100 were prepared as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Oligomycin (6 μg/ml) and DCCD (6 μg/ml) were added where indicated. Potential (ΔΨ) measurements were performed in the respiration medium (Fig. 2). With ethanol as a substrate, the addition of ADP promoted a transient decrease in the fluorescent quenching of rhodamine 123 because of proton uptake through F0 during ATP synthesis. This effect was less pronounced with mitochondria isolated from ΔATP14 + bF6 consistent with the low rate of state 3 respiration. The reversibility of the ATP synthase was also examined. Ethanol addition promoted a strong fluorescence quenching of rhodamine 123 because of the respiratory chain activity, and this was reversed by potassium cyanide. Finally, addition of ATP caused a fluorescent quenching because of its hydrolysis and the coupled pumping of protons out of the mitochondrion. Clearly, the ΔΨ generated by ATP hydrolysis in mitochondria isolated from ΔATP14 + bF6 is sensitive to either oligomycin or DCCD at concentrations used to inhibit the wild type mitochondria, but the intensity of the fluorescent quenching was not as large, and it was not as stable as compared with the wild type sample. These results suggest that the ATP synthase from ΔATP14 + bF6 is uncoupling during the course of the assay. However, the addition of oligomycin or DCCD did not affect the transmembrane potential generated by the respiratory chain, suggesting that passive proton conduction through F0 is not occurring in the absence of either ADP or ATP. The prior genetic and biochemical studies indicate that bF6 can correct for the loss of subunit h, albeit not to wild type levels. If bF6 is acting directly by substituting for subunit h in the ATP synthase, bF6 should be associated with the ATP synthase devoid of subunit h. A number of biochemical studies were performed to test this hypothesis. First Western blot analysis using anti-bF6 antiserum detected a band with a relative molecular mass of 10.6 kDa that was present in the SDS-dissociatedΔATP14 + bF6, but not wild type, mitochondrial sample (Fig.3 A). The mature bF6 has a calculated molecular mass of 9,116 Da assuming that processing occurs just prior to the Ala-Ser residues. If the protein is not processed, other than removing the initiating Met, then it would have a mass of 12,653 Da. These results suggest the 10.6-kDa peptide represents bF6 and is likely processed at the predicted point. However, N-terminal sequence analysis has not been done on the yeast-expressed bF6 to verify the site of processing. Association of bF6 to the yeast ATP synthase missing subunit h was determined by immunoprecipitation of the detergent (Triton X-100)-solubilized ATP synthase complex using antibodies directed against the α-subunit. However, unlike ATP synthase from wild type yeast, the antibodies precipitated only the F1 sector (not shown). This suggested that the association of F1 and F0 sectors was not stable during immunoprecipitation. This is consistent with the prior studies that indicated that the ATP synthase with bF6 was not as stable as the wild type enzyme. To capture the interactions between bF6 and components of the ATP synthase, the mitochondrial proteins were treated with the thiol-cleavable homobifunctional cross-linking reagent, DSP. Fig. 3 B shows that the concentration of bF6 was greatly decreased upon incubation of mitochondria with 0.2 and 0.5 mm DSP, concurrent with the presence of bands of high molecular masses, as revealed by Western blot analysis. The most intense band displayed a relative molecular mass of 36 kDa, suggesting that bF6 (9.1 kDa) was associated with a peptide of about 27 kDa. Incubation of DSP-treatedΔATP14 + bF6 mitochondria with 2-mercaptoethanol to reverse the cross-linking, eliminated the major 36-kDa product, and provided a relative increase in the amount of uncross-linked bF6. In the presence of 2-mercaptoethanol, nonspecific bands are observed in the 45-kDa region. These bands probably originate from aggregates that did not enter the gel in the absence of the reducing agent but did enter the gel in the presence of the reducing agent. Free bF6 was also prepared from mitochondria isolated from yeast ΔATP14 + bF6 to examine the behavior of bF6 upon incubation with DSP in the absence of ATP synthase (Fig.3 C). The amount of free bF6 decreased upon incubation with DSP, and this was reversed with 2-mercaptoethanol. Importantly, DSP cross-linking of free bF6 did not provide any specific bands of higher molecular masses. This suggests that nonspecific cross-linking of free bF6 occurred with other peptides, and these were reversed by reduction with 2-mercaptoethanol. To determine whether bF6 was cross-linked to the ATP synthase, mitochondria treated with DSP were extracted with Triton X-100, and the solubilized proteins were separated by sucrose-gradient centrifugation. Eleven fractions were collected and analyzed by Western blot. The samples were reduced before SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis to allow the clear identification of bF6. The blots were probed with antibodies raised against the α-subunit (an F1 subunit), subunit 4 (an F0subunit), and bF6. The wild type ATP synthase sediments to fractions 4–8 as shown by the cosedimentation of the α-subunit and subunit 4 in the sucrose gradient (Fig.4 A). For the ATP synthase from mitochondria isolated from yeast ΔATP14 + bF6, the α-subunit and subunit 4 were distributed in a much broader range of fractions, suggesting both a more complex mixture of species and a less stable assembly of the ATP synthase. This occurred in the absence of reaction with DSP (not shown) or in the presence of 0.2 mm DSP (Fig. 4 B). However, when the concentration of DSP was increased to 0.5 mm, then a significant fraction of bF6 was seen to sediment with the other subunits of the ATP synthase (Fig.4 C). This new location of bF6 in the sucrose gradient was not the result of nonspecific cross-linkings of bF6 to other proteins, because reaction of DSP with bF6, which has been freed and separated from F1F0 stayed at the top of the gradient, the same position of bF6 without reaction with DSP (Fig.4,D and E). In conclusion, the results support the hypothesis that bF6 associates to the yeast ATP synthase. If bF6 was acting directly by replacing subunith, then not only should it associate with the ATP synthase, but it should also interact with the same peptides of the ATP synthase as subunit h. To test this hypothesis, the protein partners of bF6 were determined by Western blot analysis after cross-linking the peptides with DSP. The results from Fig. 3 indicate that the major cross-linked species with bF6 had a molecular mass of about 36 kDa, suggesting that bF6 was cross-linked to a peptide 20–30 kDa in size. As a consequence, antibodies raised against subunits of the ATP synthase whose molecular mass were within this range, OSCP and subunits 6,d, and 4, were used in the analysis. In addition, long polyacrylamide slab gels were used to clearly identify the cross-linked products (Fig. 5). In a wild type context, numerous cross-linked products involving subunit 4 have been reported, and the most intense band that was found in the 36-kDa region has been identified as4+g (15Soubannier V. Rusconi F. Vaillier J. Arselin G. Chaingnepain S. Graves P.V. Schmitter J.M. Zhang J.L. Mueller D. Velours J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 15017-15024Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). This same cross-linked product was present for both the ATP synthase from the wild type andΔATP14 + bF6 strains (Fig. 5,A and B). However, there was an additional band at about 36 kDa that was obtained upon incubation with 0.2 and 0.5 mm DSP and that was seen with antibodies against either subunit 4 or bF6. This band ran slightly ahead of the 4+g cross-linked product, and it was absent from the wild type sample (Fig. 5 B). This band is thus concluded to be a cross-linked product of bF6 and subunit 4. Two other bands of low intensity and showing relative molecular masses of 42 and 56 kDa could be heterooligomers containing at least bF6 and subunit d because the latter cross-linked products were absent from the wild type sample (Fig.5 C). Antibodies raised against subunit 6 and OSCP did not identify any bands that were also detected by antibodies against bF6 (not shown). The increased intensity of a 26-kDa band upon cross-linking of the ΔATP14 + bF6 mitochondria represents a cross-link involving subunit d and a small component of the yeast ATP synthase (Fig. 5 C). The latter band was less apparent in the wild type sample. Thus, these results indicated that bF6associated with subunit 4 of the ATP synthase consistent with the interactions of subunit h in the ATP synthase. Subunit h is an essential component of the yeast ATP synthase. It has been described as a supernumerary protein that, until this study, was not apparently related to any subunit described in other ATP synthases (14Arselin G. Vaillier J. Graves P.V. Velours J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20284-20290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Primary structural analysis of nucleotide data banks have identified the existence of an open reading frame inSchizosaccharomyces pombe (TrEMBL accession number 059673) that encodes an hypothetical protein 27% identical to subunith and another in Botryotinia fuckeliana(GenBankTM accession number AL115386) that also encodes a hypothetical protein 38% identical to subunit h. Yeast subunit h is essential for yeast to grow on a nonfermentable carbon sources, and mitochondria isolated from a yeast strain with a null mutation in subunit h have an ATPase activity that is oligomycin-insensitive and the catalytic sector dissociated from the membrane components (14Arselin G. Vaillier J. Graves P.V. Velours J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20284-20290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Mammalian coupling factor F6 is an essential component of the mammalian mitochondrial ATP synthase. F6 is known to be required for restoration of ATP-Pi exchange and oligomycin-sensitive ATPase activity to factor 6-depleted ATP synthase (27Fessenden-Raden J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 2351-2357Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Joshi S. Pringle M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 15548-15551Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is also involved in the binding of F1 to F0 (29Sandri G. Wojtczak L. Ernster L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1985; 239: 595-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) and shields F1 from limited proteolysis (30Ko Y.H. Hullihen J. Hong S. Pedersen P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32931-32939Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). As such, F6 is thought to be required for the coupling of proton translocation to the synthesis of ATP. The results in this manuscript are quite surprising and have important implications. Both genetic and biochemical data indicate that subunith of the yeast ATP synthase is the homolog of mammalian coupling factor F6. This is a rather surprising because both of these subunits are essential components of their respective multimeric peptide complexes. Despite the apparent functional homology of subunit h with F6, primary sequence alignment of both subunits shows a very low sequence identity of just 14.5% and, when allowing for amino acid replacements, a 54% similarity (Fig.6). This low level of sequence identity and homology is at the level seen between two random peptides. In contrast, most of the remaining subunits of the ATP synthase demonstrate a high degree of identity (31Walker J.E. Fearnley I.M. Gay N.J. Gibson B.W. Northrop F.D. Powell S.J. Runswick M.J. Saraste M. Tybulewicz V.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1985; 184: 677-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). For instance, the α-and β-subunits of the yeast ATP synthase are highly conserved with percent identities of about 72 and 75%, respectively. Thus, it is surprising that bF6 is able to replace subunit hand form a functional enzyme, even now, knowing that they are functional homologs. The biochemical studies here demonstrate that the complementation by bF6 is due to the direct replacement of subunith with bF6 and not due to a secondary mechanism. The biochemical studies indicate that bF6 occupies that same spatial relationship in the yeast enzyme as subunit h. Cross-linking products involving subunit h and subunit4, a component of the second stalk, were obtained from positions K98C (15Soubannier V. Rusconi F. Vaillier J. Arselin G. Chaingnepain S. Graves P.V. Schmitter J.M. Zhang J.L. Mueller D. Velours J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 15017-15024Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) and Q203C of the latter subunit, 2V. Soubannier and J. Velours, unpublished observation. which are two positions located in the hydrophilic part of subunit 4, thus suggesting that subunit h also participates to form the second stalk or stator. Bovine F6 is a component of F0 (11Collinson I.R. Runswick M.J. Buchana S.K. Fearnley I.M. Skehel J.M. van Raaij M.J. Griffiths D.E. Walker J.E.

Runswick M.J. Fearnley I.M. Skehel J.M. Orriss G.L. Miroux B. Walker J.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 242: 408-421PubMed Google Scholar). Nearest neighbors relationships have been demonstrated, by cross-linking experiments, between F6 and the b-subunit (subunit 4) (34Joshi S. Burrows R. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14518-14525Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and bF6 with the α- and β-subunits (35Belogrudov G.L. Tomich J.M. Hatefi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 32053-32060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The data in this study indicate that subunit 4 is the major peptide cross-linked with bF6 using DSP within the yeast enzyme missing subunit h. Thus, bF6 and subunith appear to occupy the same spatial arrangement in the enzyme, and bF6 can directly replace subunit hin the yeast enzyme. Despite the lack of primary structural similarity, subunit hand bF6 must share some structural features that define them as functional homologs, and indeed, there are some features that are conserved. First, they are both relatively small peptides with calculated molecular masses of 10,408 and 8,958 Da for subunith and bF6, respectively. Second, both subunith and bF6 are acidic proteins showing pI of 4.06 and 5.23, respectively. Third, secondary structural computer analyses predict two α-helix regions for both subunits: the first α-helix formed by residues 6–23 for bF6 and by residues 2–13 for subunit h and the second α-helix formed by residues 34–50 for bF6 and residues 47–64 for subunit h. Fourth, they both have an acidic tail, although it is slightly longer in subunit h. Thus, these conserved features may form some of the basis required for the functional replacement of bF6for subunit h. Of course, beyond these features, it is possible that despite low primary sequence identity, that these peptides fold into similar three-dimensional structures. The partial complementation of the null mutant atp14 by the bovine coupling factor 6 is more consistent with the fact that F6 or h are important for stabilizing the ATP synthase than for a mechanistic role. Of all the F0components, bF6 and subunit h are the only acidic proteins. One possible hypothesis is that these highly negative charged proteins help in the association of other positively charged components of the second stalk, such as subunits 4,d, and OSCP, three proteins with calculated pIs of 7.83, 8.92, and 9.3, respectively. Expressions of other subunits of the mammalian ATP synthase have been demonstrated to complement the corresponding null mutations in yeast. Expression of bovine α-, β-, γ-, and ε-subunits (17Lai-Zhang J. Mueller D.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 2409-2418Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) and rat OSCP (36Prescott M. Higuti T. Nagley P. Devenish R.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 207: 943-949Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) have all complemented the corresponding null mutant strains in yeast. However, although some of these homologous peptides did not show a large amount of identity, it was always high enough to suggest them as homologs by simple primary structural analysis. Subunith and bF6 are so divergent that even a one on one comparison of their primary structure provided no clue that they were indeed homologs. The results of this study are even more startling because these peptides are not the sole peptide in an enzyme complex, but must interact within a heterosubunit multimeric enzyme complex. The implications of this are significant because they indicate that primary structural analysis cannot be used as the sole evidence that functional peptide homologs do not exist between two species. This is true even when the peptide is within a multimeric peptide complex that otherwise might be highly conserved. We thank Dr. D. Brèthes and Dr. P. V.

Site-directed mutagenesis experiments further demonstrated the important role of two of the four cysteines of GlmU, namely residues Cys307 and Cys324, for acetyltransferase activity (17Pompeo F. van Heijenoort J. Mengin-Lecreulx D. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 4799-4803Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The GlmU protein has been shown to exhibit a number of characteristics, which suggested that the acetyltransferase and uridyltransferase activities may reside in separate catalytic domains: (i) the substrates, products, and effectors of the acetyltransferase reaction did not inhibit the uridyltransferase activity and vice versa (13Mengin-Lecreulx D. van Heijenoort J. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 5788-5795Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 18Gehring A.M. Lees W.J. Mindiola D.J. Walsh C.T. Brown E.D. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 579-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar); (ii) the intermediate GlcNAc-1-P was clearly released from the acetyltransferase domain prior to transformation by the uridyltransferase domain (18Gehring A.M. Lees W.J. Mindiola D.J. Walsh C.T. Brown E.D. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 579-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar); (iii) portions of the GlmU amino acid sequence showing similarities with that of other previously characterized XDP-sugar pyrophosphorylase and acetyltransferase activities were located in theN-terminal portion and the second third of the protein, respectively (13Mengin-Lecreulx D. van Heijenoort J. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 5788-5795Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 15Ullrich J. van Putten J.P.M. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 6902-6909Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Vaara M. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1992; 97: 249-254Crossref Google Scholar); (iv) the acetyltransferase but not the uridyltransferase was shown to be inactivated by thiol-specific reagents, and the two cysteine residues whose alteration resulted in dramatic decreases of acetyltransferase activity were identified in the second moiety of the protein sequence (17Pompeo F. van Heijenoort J. Mengin-Lecreulx D. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 4799-4803Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); (v) mutagenesis of residues that are important for uridyltransferase activity did not affect acetyltransferase at all (Ref. 20Brown K. Pompeo F. Dixon S. Mengin-Lecreulx D. Cambillau C. Bourne Y. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4096-4107Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar and data not shown); (vi) the fusion of a His6 tag at the C terminus of the protein resulted in a 20-fold decrease of acetyltransferase activity, without change in its uridyltransferase activity (17Pompeo F. van Heijenoort J. Mengin-Lecreulx D. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 4799-4803Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The crystal structure of a truncated form of the GlmU enzyme, GlmU-Tr331, was recently resolved at 2.25- and 2.3-Å resolution in the absence or presence of UDP-GlcNAc, respectively (20Brown K. Pompeo F. Dixon S. Mengin-Lecreulx D. Cambillau C. Bourne Y. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4096-4107Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). The crystal structure is composed of two distinct domains connected by a long α-helical arm: a N-terminal domain resembling the dinucleotide-binding Rossmann fold and a C-terminal domain adopting a left-handed parallel β-helix structure (LβH) that is also found in homologous bacterial acyl- and acetyltransferases (21Beaman T.W. Binder D.A. Blanchard J.S. Roderick S.L. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 489-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 22Beaman T.W. Sugantino M. Roderick S.L.

We here report the construction of truncated forms of this enzyme, which confirms that the bifunctional enzyme is composed of two autonomously folding and functional domains of roughly equivalent sizes, the N-terminal one exhibiting uridyltransferase activity and the C-terminal one acetyltransferase activity. It is also shown that trimer organization is essential for expression of the acetyltransferase activity and that the catalytic site of the latter should be formed by complementary regions from adjacent monomers. E. coli strains JM83 (ara Δ[lac-proAB]rpsL thi Φ80 dlacZ ΔM15) (25Yanisch-Perron C. Vieira J. Messing J. Gene (Amst.). 1985; 33: 103-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (11465) Google Scholar) and DH5α (supE44 ΔlacU169 hsdR17 recA1 endA1 gyrA96 thi-1 relA1 Φ80 dlacZ ΔM15) (Life Technologies, Inc.) were used as hosts for plasmids and for the overproduction of wild-type and mutant GlmU enzymes. Strain UGS83 (JM83glmU::kan [pGMU]), which carries an inactivated copy of the glmU gene on the chromosome and a wild-type copy of glmU on a plasmid whose replication is thermosensitive, was used in complementation experiments (7Mengin-Lecreulx D. van Heijenoort J. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 6150-6157Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The plasmid vector pTrc His30 for expression of proteins under a N-terminal histidine-tagged form has been described previously (17Pompeo F. van Heijenoort J. Mengin-Lecreulx D. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 4799-4803Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). 2YT (26Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972Google Scholar) was used as culture medium, and growth was monitored at 600 nm with a Shimadzu UV-1601 spectrophotometer. For strains carrying drug resistance genes, antibiotics were used at the concentrations of 100 (ampicillin), 35 (kanamycin), and 25 (chloramphenicol) μg·ml−1. Standard procedures for molecular cloning (27Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) and E. coli cell transformation (28Dagert M. Ehrlich S.D. Gene (Amst.). 1979; 6: 23-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (849) Google Scholar) were used. The pFP1 and pFP3 plasmids, allowing expression of the wild-type and N-terminal His6-tagged forms of GlmU, respectively (under control of the strong trc promoter), have been described previously (17Pompeo F. van Heijenoort J. Mengin-Lecreulx D. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 4799-4803Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). DNA fragments encoding C-terminally truncated enzymes (i.e. GlmU-Tr227, -Tr250, and -Tr331) were generated by PCR using the following oligonucleotides as primers: 5′-GGACGGGATCCTTGAATAATGCTATGAGCGTAGTGA-3′ as a sense primer, 5′-GCAGCTGCAGTCACACGCCTTCTACTTCGCT-3′ for Tr227, 5′-GCATCTGCAGTCATAACAGCAGTTTTTCAGCCTG-3′ for Tr250, and 5′-CTCAGCTGCAGGACGCAATCAGGCAAACGG-3′ for Tr331 as antisense primers, respectively. The resulting PCR products were purified, digested with Bam HI and Pst I (in bold), and inserted into the pTrc His30 vector. DNA fragments encoding N-terminally truncated enzymes (i.e. GlmU-del78, -del130, -del227, -del233, and -del250) were similarly generated by PCR using the following primers: 5′-AGCCCTGCAGAATCACTTTTTCTTTACCGG-3′ as an antisense primer, and 5′-GTGCTTGGATCCGAGCAGCTGGGTACGGGT-3′ for del78, 5′-ATTGGTGGATCCACGGTGAAACTGGATGATCCG-3′ for del130, 5′-GTAGAAGGATCCAATAACCGCCTGCAACTC-3′ for del227, 5′-CGCCTGGGATCCTCCCGTCTGGAGCGTGTT-3′ for del233, and 5′-AAACTGGGATCCGCAGGCGTTATGCTGCGC-3′ for del250 as sense primers, respectively. PCR products were purified, digested withBam HI and Pst I (in bold), and inserted into the pTrc His30 vector. The pFP1kan plasmid was constructed by inserting the 1.28-kilobase pair Hin cII kanamycin resistance cartridge from pUC4K (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) at the Sca I site lying within the ampicillin resistance gene from pFP1. E. coli cells carrying plasmids described in this work were grown at 37 °C in 2YT-ampicillin medium (0.5-liter cultures). When the optical density (OD) of the culture reached 0.4, IPTG was added at a final concentration of 1 mm and growth was continued for 3 h. Cells were harvested and washed with 40 ml of cold 20 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, containing 0.5 mm MgCl2 and 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol. The cell pellet was suspended in 5 ml of the same buffer supplemented with a mixture of protease inhibitors: 1 mm leupeptin, 1 mm benzamidine, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 20 μg·ml−1 trypsin inhibitor. Cells were disrupted by sonication in the cold and the resulting suspension was centrifuged at 4 °C for 30 min at 200,000 × g. The supernatant was dialyzed against 100 volumes of the same buffer. SDS-PAGE analysis of proteins were performed as described previously (29Laemmli U.K. Favre M. J. Mol. Biol. 1973; 80: 575-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (3025) Google Scholar). The different His6-tagged enzymes were purified as reported recently (17Pompeo F. van Heijenoort J. Mengin-Lecreulx D. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 4799-4803Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), basically following the steps in the manufacturer's (Qiagen) recommendations: binding of His6-GlmU on Ni2+-nitrilotriacetate-agarose (Ni2+-NTA) and extensive washing with 20 mmpotassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, containing 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 300 mm NaCl, and 20–100 mm imidazole to remove impurities; elution of His6-GlmU with imidazole (100–300 mm) added to washing buffer; dialysis of His6-GlmU eluate against 100 volumes of the same phosphate buffer supplemented with 10% glycerol. The His6-tagged GlmU enzymes prepared in this manner were all at least 90% pure, as estimated by SDS-PAGE. Protein concentrations were determined by the method of Bradford, with bovine serum albumin as a standard (30Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216440) Google Scholar). Cells of JM83(pFP3-Tr331) were grown at 37 °C in 2YT medium (1-liter cultures). At OD = 0.1 (∼6 × 107 cells·ml−1), IPTG was added to one culture at a final concentration of 1 mm. As soon as the first effects on cell growth were observed in induced cells (∼2 h later, final OD = 0.7), cultures were stopped by rapid chilling to 4 °C, and cells were harvested in the cold. Cultures of JM83 cells carrying the pTrc His30 vector were made in parallel as a control. The extraction of peptidoglycan nucleotide precursors as well as the analytical procedure used for their quantitation were as described previously (31Mengin-Lecreulx D. Flouret B. van Heijenoort J. J. Bacteriol. 1982; 151: 1109-1117Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). UDP-GlcN was purified from cell extracts by first using the same two-step chromatographic procedure that is commonly used to purify the peptidoglycan nucleotide precursors: a gel filtration on Sephadex G-25 followed by HPLC on a column of μBondapak C18 (7.8 × 300 mm), where it is eluted in mixture with UDP-GlcNAc (31Mengin-Lecreulx D. Flouret B. van Heijenoort J. J. Bacteriol. 1982; 151: 1109-1117Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The separation of UDP-GlcN and UDP-GlcNAc was then achieved by a second step of HPLC on the same column, using this time an elution with 50 mm triethylammonium formate, pH 4.75, at a flow rate of 3 ml·min−1 (their retention times were 9 and 21 min, respectively). Cells of JM83(pFP3-Tr331) and JM83(pTrc His30) were grown and induced with IPTG as described above (0.5-liter cultures). Harvested cells were washed with a cold 0.85% NaCl solution and centrifuged again. Bacteria were then rapidly suspended under vigorous stirring in a hot (95–100 °C) aqueous 4% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) solution (20 ml) for 30 min. After standing overnight at room temperature, the suspensions were centrifuged for 30 min at 200,000 × g in a Beckman TL100 centrifuge and the pellets were washed several times with water. Final suspensions were made in 2 ml of water, and aliquots (100 μl) were hydrolyzed and analyzed with a Biotronik model LC2000 amino acid analyzer. The peptidoglycan content of the sacculi was expressed in terms of its muramic acid content (31Mengin-Lecreulx D. Flouret B. van Heijenoort J. J. Bacteriol. 1982; 151: 1109-1117Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 32Mengin-Lecreulx D. van Heijenoort J. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 163: 208-212Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Assays for both activities of GlmU were performed as described previously (17Pompeo F. van Heijenoort J. Mengin-Lecreulx D. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 4799-4803Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), after appropriate dilutions of the enzyme in 20 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, containing 1 mg·ml−1 BSA, 0.5 mmMgCl2, and 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol. One unit of enzyme activity was defined as the amount that catalyzed the formation of 1 μmol of product/min. UDP-GlcN, which is used as an alternative substrate of GlmU in some acetyltransferase assays, was synthesized enzymatically by using UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase, as described by Gehring et al. (18Gehring A.M. Lees W.J. Mindiola D.J. Walsh C.T. Brown E.D. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 579-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). This compound was purified by HPLC as described above, and its authenticity was confirmed by determination of its hexosamine content after acid hydrolysis. Pure samples of the different truncated GlmU proteins (50 μl of 1 mg·ml−1 solutions) were applied onto a column of Superdex 200 HR 10/30 connected to a fast pressure liquid chromatography apparatus (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The column was equilibrated with 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, containing 150 mm NaCl and 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol, and samples were eluted at 0.5 ml·min−1. Calibration was carried out with cytochrome c, myoglobin, α-chymotrypsinogen A, ovalbumin, and BSA, and the void and total volumes were determined with blue dextran 2000 and tyrosine, respectively. Elution was followed by measurement of the absorbance at 280 nm. As attempts to crystallize the full-length GlmU protein remained unsuccessful, crystallization of individual domains was therefore envisaged. This prompted us to more precisely define the size of the two putative autonomous domains. Plasmids for high-level overexpression of GlmU proteins truncated either in the N- (del constructs) or in the C-terminal (Tr constructs) region were constructed (Fig. 1). All of these proteins were expressed in a His6-tagged form (N-terminal Met-His6-Gly-Ser extension), allowing their convenient one-step purification. Most of them were successfully overproduced in a soluble form and were purified to near homogeneity (Fig.2). Others (del26, del182, del250, and Tr227) either appeared very poorly produced, due probably to structural instability and rapid intracellular degradation, or formed insoluble inclusion bodies.Figure 2SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of purified truncated forms of the E. coli GlmU protein. Full-length and truncated GlmU proteins were overproduced in E. coli cells in the His6-tagged form (N-terminal Met-His6-Gly-Ser extension).

This was confirmed by assays of the pure proteins for acetyl- and uridyltransferase activities (TableI). The uridyltransferase activity of proteins truncated in the N-terminal region (del78, del130, del227, and del233) was decreased by a factor of at least 1000, but surprisingly a residual and almost invariant activity (k cat = 0.1–0.3 s−1) was retained by all of them. As discussed below, this residual activity was due to contaminating wild-type GlmU enzyme (originating from chromosomal gene expression) that could form heterotrimers with these His6-tagged truncated proteins. The deletion of the first 130 N-terminal amino acid residues of GlmU resulted in only a 50% decrease of its acetyltransferase activity. Truncation of 100 more residues (del233) was accompanied by a more important decrease (98%) of activity, but the residual acetyltransferase activity remained relatively high with ak cat of 25 s−1. Gehringet al. (18Gehring A.M. Lees W.J. Mindiola D.J. Walsh C.T. Brown E.D. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 579-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) also previously constructed a truncated form of GlmU (glutathione S-transferase fusion), deleted in that case of the first 179 residues. Its acetyltransferase activity was 150-fold reduced as compared with full-length GlmU with ak cat of 0.5 s−1. As shown in Table I, an inverse pattern of activities was observed for proteins carrying deletions in the C-terminal region; Tr331 and Tr250 proteins lacking the last 125 and last 206 amino acid residues, respectively, had undetectable acetyltransferase activity but retained significant uridyltransferase activity (42% and 2.5% of wild-type enzyme activity, respectively).Table IEnzymatic activities and oligomerization state of truncated GlmU proteinsProteinMassAcetyltransferase activity (k cat)Uridyltransferase activity (k cat)Oligomerization statekDas−1s−1Full-length GlmU50.11350330TrimerGlmU-del7841.88900.25TrimerGlmU-del13036.27300.35TrimerGlmU-del22725.62.50.1TrimerGlmU-del23324.7250.2TrimerGlmU-Tr33137.1ND1-aNo activity detected (k cat < 0.0001 s−1).140TrimerGlmU-Tr25028.6ND8MonomerFull-length and truncated GlmU proteins were overproduced in E. coli cells in the His6-tagged form (N-terminal Met-His6-Gly-Ser extension).

Open table in a new tab Full-length and truncated GlmU proteins were overproduced in E. coli cells in the His6-tagged form (N-terminal Met-His6-Gly-Ser extension). They were purified on Ni2+-NTA and assayed for both enzyme activities of GlmU. The values represent the means of three determinations. Their oligomerization state was determined by gel filtration as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Yields of these different truncated proteins were similar, from 2.5 to 10 mg of protein per 0.5 liter of culture. As reported previously, chromatography of full-length GlmU protein on gel filtration was consistent with a homotrimer arrangement (13Mengin-Lecreulx D. van Heijenoort J. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 5788-5795Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). The oligomerization state of the different truncated GlmU fragments generated here was then investigated (TableI). The ability of the proteins to trimerize was clearly correlated to the presence of at least the initial part of the C-terminal domain. The fact that the two del227 and Tr331 proteins were trimers suggested that residues involved in the oligomerization process might be located between these two sites of truncation. With the exception of the Tr250 protein, which turned out to be a monomer, all other truncated proteins generated in the present work consisted of trimers. As shown above, a very low but detectable uridyltransferase activity of 0.1–0.3 s−1 was consistently detected with all preparations of proteins carrying either partial or complete deletions of the N-terminal domain (del78 to del233). It should be noted that these proteins, which carry only one of the two activities of GlmU, could not complement the glmU mutant strain UGS83 and have consequently been expressed in a wild-type E. coli strain. The simplest interpretation was the presence in these preparations of contaminating full-length (non-His-tagged) GlmU enzyme originating from chromosomal expression. That the wild-type enzyme could not be eliminated by extensive washings of the His6-tagged truncated proteins adsorbed on Ni2+-NTA with buffers containing 300 mm NaCl and 20–100 mm imidazole suggested a very tight association (formation of heterotrimers) between the full-length and the truncated proteins. It was effectively controlled that the pure wild-type (non-His-tagged) GlmU protein had by itself no particular affinity for the Ni2+-NTA matrix, i.e. was detected essentially in the pass-through fraction and had been completely eliminated from the column by washing with 20 mm imidazole containing buffers, as confirmed by SDS-PAGE analysis and enzymatic assays (data not shown). JM83 cells carrying the plasmid pFP3-Tr331 were grown in rich medium and expression of the truncated gene was induced with 1 mm IPTG. It resulted in a significant overproduction of the truncated protein, as observed by SDS-PAGE. Interestingly, after"

In the present study, we used the crystallographic data available for BPI to build a three-dimensional model for PLTP. Multiple sequence alignment suggested that, in PLTP, a cluster of hydrophobic residues substitutes for a cluster of positively charged residues found on the surface of LBP and BPI, which is critical for interaction with lipopolysaccharides.

To assess the role of this hydrophobic cluster for the functional activity of PLTP, single point alanine mutants were engineered.

Although the physiological role of PLTP has not been completely defined yet, recent in vivostudies conducted with PLTP transgenic and knock-out mice strongly suggest that PLTP contributes to the control and regulation of HDL levels and to the generation of pre-β HDL, the initial acceptors of cellular cholesterol (3Huuskonen J.

Carroll S.F. Eisenberg D. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 906-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The three-dimensional structure of BPI was recently determined by x-ray crystallography (10Beamer L.J. Carroll S.F. Eisenberg D. Science. 1997; 276: 1861-1864Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); this protein appears as a boomerang-shaped molecule, which consists of two symmetrical barrels connected by a linker region. Each barrel forms a hydrophobic pocket that can incorporate one phosphatidylcholine molecule. The crystal structure of BPI provides a useful framework for the modeling of the three-dimensional structure of the other members of the LT/LBP family, as well as for the investigation of their functional similarities and differences. Several structure/function studies were recently aimed at identifying the functional domains and elucidating the mechanism of action of LBP, BPI, and CETP (11Schumann R.R. Latz E. Chem.

These results demonstrated that the activity of the lipopolysaccharide-binding and lipid transfer proteins depends not only upon their ability to accommodate specific lipid substrates but also upon their interaction with bacteria and/or lipoproteins. The molecular interaction of LBP with surface-exposed lipopolysaccharides on bacteria is critical for its activity (11Schumann R.R. Latz E. Chem. Immunol. 2000; 74: 42-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), and a cluster of positively charged amino acids (Arg-94, Lys-95, and Lys-99) was recently identified as the lipopolysaccharide-binding domain of this protein (16Lamping N. Hoess A., Yu, B. Park T.C. Kirschning C.-J. Pfeil D. Reuter D. Wright S.D. Herrmann F. Schumann R.R. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 4648-4656PubMed Google Scholar). Based on the crystal structure of BPI, this cationic cluster is fully exposed at the N-terminal tip of the boomerang-shaped LBP model (17Beamer L.J. Carroll S.F. Eisenberg D. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1999; 57: 225-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Because PLTP activity and HDL metabolism are closely related (3Huuskonen J. Ehnholm C. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 2000; 11: 285-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), a defective binding of PLTP to its HDL substrate would have direct physiological consequences, and the factors that regulate the association of PLTP with HDL are highly relevant to lipoprotein metabolism. Although the molecular and macromolecular specificity of PLTP has been thoroughly investigated (18Massey J.B. Hickson-Bick D. Via D.P. Gotto Jr, A.M. Pownall H.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 835: 124-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 19Sweeny S.A. Jonas A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 835: 279-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 20Huuskonen J.

Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 3645-3653Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), the structure/function relationships of this protein have not been completely resolved (22Huuskonen J. Wohlfahrt G. Jauhiainen M. Ehnholm C. Teleman O. Olkonnen V.M. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 1123-1130Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the molecular determinants regulating the association of PLTP with lipoproteins have not been elucidated yet. In the present study, we performed multiple sequence alignment between members of the LT/LBP family and used the coordinates of crystallized BPI to build a three-dimensional model for PLTP. The results suggest that in PLTP, a cluster of hydrophobic residues, Tyr-45, Tyr-90, Trp-91, Phe-92, Phe-93, and Tyr-94, substitutes for the positively charged LPS-binding patch located on the surface of LBP and BPI. From the engineered PLTP model and the characterization of PLTP mutants obtained by site-directed mutagenesis, we propose that this solvent-exposed hydrophobic cluster is critical for the interaction of PLTP with its preferred substrate, HDL. Egg yolk phosphatidylcholine (PC), bovine brain phosphatidylserine, 2,4,6-trinitrophenyl-phosphatidylethanolamine (TNP-PE) (used as a quencher of pyrene fluorescence in liposomes), and human serum albumin were obtained from Sigma. 1-Hexadecanoyl-2-(1-pyrenedecanoyl)-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine was purchased from Molecular Probes. Phospholipid concentrations were measured by an enzymatic method using Biomérieux reagents. Thirteen sequences of BPI, LBP, CETP, and PLTP from various species were aligned using the ClustalW program (23Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (56002) Google Scholar) and the Hidden Markov Model method SAM-T99 (24Karplus K. Barrett C. Cline M. Diekhans M. Grate L. Hughey R. Proteins. 1999; 37 Suppl. 3: 121-125Crossref Google Scholar, 25Karplus K. Barrett C. Hughey R. Bioinformatics. 1998; 14: 846-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (912) Google Scholar), both available on the Web. The SAM-T99 sequence alignment was plotted using the Alscript software (26Barton G.J. Protein Eng. 1993; 6: 37-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (1112) Google Scholar), and the conservation index per residue was calculated using the AMAS program (27Livingstone C.D. Barton G.J. Comput. Appl. Biosci. 1993; 9: 745-775PubMed Google Scholar) also available on the Web. The working model for the human PLTP structure was built based on this alignment, and on the Protein Data Bank coordinates of the BPI protein (10Beamer L.J. Carroll S.F. Eisenberg D. Science. 1997; 276: 1861-1864Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), by using the HOMOLOGY software of the Insight II package (Molecular Simulations, San Diego, CA). The quality of the model was checked using WHATCHECK (28Rodriguez R. Chinea G. Lopez N. Pons T. Vriend G. Comput. Appl. Biosci. 1998; 14: 523-528Google Scholar) and PROCHECK (29Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar). When aligned with the BPI template, the PLTP sequence contains four deletions defined as loops 1, 3, 4, and 5. They were replaced by the best fitting loops found by an automatic loop search of a nonredundant Protein Data Bank data base (Fig. 1). Loop 2 contains no insertions or deletions but falls within a sequence region with weak similarity with BPI; its coordinates were copied from the BPI template. Nonconserved side chains were replaced by their best-fitting rotamers using the program SCWRL (30Bower M.J. Cohen F.E. Dunbrack Jr., R.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 267: 1268-1282Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar). The model was soaked with water, and the solvated model was then energy-minimized in steps with decreasing constraints on the conserved backbone and side chains using CDiscover (Molecular Simulations) with the CVFF force field and the cell multipole method. The model was relaxed by steepest descent and conjugate gradient minimization until a convergence of <0.5 kcal/mol/Å2 was achieved. The conformation of loops 1, 2, and 4 in the N-terminal “tip” of PLTP was further studied by molecular dynamics simulation as follows: all residues within 5 Å of loops 1, 2, and 4 were allowed to move, while the rest of the PLTP model was fixed. A 16-Å layer of water was created around the mobile PLTP residues, and the model was energy-minimized to converge at <0.5 kcal/mol/Å2. During the molecular dynamics simulation, the system was equilibrated at 900 K in 5 ps, kept at 900 K for 20 ps, followed by a 10-ps dynamics simulation at 300 K. The final structure was energy-minimized by steepest descent and conjugate gradient minimization. Oligonucleotides containing the desired mutations were purchased from Eurogentec (Seraing, Belgium). Each of the Tyr-45, Tyr-90, Trp-91, Phe-92, Phe-93, and Tyr-94 residues was mutated to an alanine, and restriction sites were introduced by silent mutagenesis to verify the presence of each mutation prior to subcloning. Mutagenesis of the PLTP cDNA was carried out by using the Stratagene QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit. The PLTP14 vector was a kind gift from Drs. J. J. Albers and A.-Y. Tu (Seattle, WA) and was used as the template for PCR. The PCR reactions were set up according to instructions of the manufacturer using the following thermal cycling conditions: 95 °C for 1 min, 55 °C for 1 min, and 68 °C for 16 min (2 min/kb of plasmid length). After PCR andDpnI digestion of the parental dam-methylated template (2 h at 37 °C), the mutant plasmids were transformed into XL1 blueEscherichia coli cells and resulting colonies were screened by restriction analysis. Transient expression of the PLTP cDNA into COS-1 cells was carried out by transfection with a mixture of 2 μg of the recombinant plasmids and 8.6 μg of LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) in serum-free DMEM. After 5-h incubation at 37 °C, cells were washed and grown overnight in complete DMEM. DMEM was then replaced by Optimem (Life Technologies, Inc.), and media were harvested between 24 and 96 h. After 10-min centrifugation at 1000 rpm, the media were stored at −20 °C in 1-ml aliquots. Secretion of PLTP mutants into the media of the transfected COS-1 cells was assessed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis separation in 10% acrylamide and by Western blotting of the media after 3-fold concentration by acetone precipitation. Serial dilutions of a plasma protein fraction with a known PLTP concentration, quantified by a previously described enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (31Desrumaux C. Athias A. Bessède G. Vergès B. Farnier M. Perségol L. Gambert P. Lagrost L. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1999; 19: 266-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), were used as standards for quantification of PLTP in the cell media. After electrophoresis, the proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Immobilon P transfer membranes, Millipore), which were subsequently blocked with 50 g/liter nonfat dry milk in a phosphate-buffered saline buffer containing 1 g/liter Tween 20, for 1 h at room temperature. The membranes were incubated overnight at 4 °C with rabbit anti-PLTP antibodies (a generous gift from Dr. L. Lagrost, Dijon, France) diluted in phosphate-buffered saline containing 10 g/liter human serum albumin. After incubation with horseradish peroxidase-labeled anti-rabbit IgG antibodies (Dako), blots were revealed by chemiluminescence (ECL kit, Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and scanned on a densitometer. Very-low density (VLDL), low density (LDL), and high density (HDL) lipoproteins were isolated at d < 1.019 g/ml, 1.019 < d < 1.063 g/ml, and 1.07 <d < 1.21 g/ml, respectively, according to standard protocols (32Havel R.J. Eder H.A. Bragdon J.H. J. Clin. Invest. 1955; 34: 1345-1353Crossref PubMed Scopus (6498) Google Scholar). Densities were adjusted by the addition of KBr. All isolated lipoproteins were dialyzed overnight against a Tris/HCl buffer (10 mm Tris, 1 mm EDTA, 3 mmNaN3, pH 7.4). PLTP activity was monitored by a fluorometric assay (20Huuskonen J. Olkkonen V.M. Jauhiainen M. Metso J. Somerharju P Ehnholm C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1303: 207-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) in the supernatant of cells transfected with wild-type (WT) or mutated PLTP, or of nontransfected cells (mock). In this assay, the rate of phospholipid transfer is monitored by the increase of pyrene monomer fluorescence intensity upon transfer of pyrene-labeled phosphatidylcholine from quenched donors to unquenched acceptors. The molar composition of the donor liposomes consisted of 68% egg yolk PC, 17% phosphatidylserine (PS), 2.5% pyrene-labeled PC (1-hexadecanoyl-2-(1-pyrenedecanoyl)-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine), and 12.5% TNP-PE (the quencher of pyrene fluorescence). 12 nmol of donor liposomes containing quenched pyrene-PC-containing liposomes was mixed with 80 nmol of unlabeled HDL used as acceptors, in the presence of cell media containing PLTP. Pyrene-PC transfer was accompanied by an increase of the monomer fluorescence intensity (excitation wavelength, 342 nm; emission wavelength, 378 nm) due to release and dequenching of the pyrene probe from the liposomes. The initial slope of the fluorescence intensity increase as a function of time represented a measure of the PLTP activity in the medium. The activity measured with mock medium was close to the spontaneous transfer activity and taken as a blank value for all activity determinations. In this assay, the volume of cell medium was adjusted to yield a value within the linear range of the fluorescence curve. The assay was calibrated by measuring the rate of transfer of 14C-radiolabeled phosphatidylcholine in a plasma sample, which was subsequently used as a standard for the fluorometric measurements. These assays were as described above, except that acceptor HDL were replaced by VLDL or LDL, containing an equivalent amount (80 nmol) of phospholipids. The volume of medium used for measurements was taken within the linear range of the activity curve. We developed an “inter-HDL” transfer system in which pyrene-labeled HDLs were used as phospholipid donors while unlabeled HDLs served as acceptors. Pyrene-labeled HDL were prepared by ethanol injection of pyrene-phosphatidylcholine. Briefly, 300 nmol of 1-hexadecanoyl-2-(1-pyrenedecanoyl)-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine were dissolved in ethanol and injected into HDL (3 μmol of phospholipids) under continuous stirring. The mixture was then incubated for 6 h at 37 °C while mixing, and the HDL were reisolated by ultracentrifugation between densities 1.07 and 1.21 g/ml. 60–70% of the label was incorporated into HDL, corresponding to 6.5 mol % of HDL phospholipids. For PLTP activity measurements, pyrene-labeled HDL (40 nmol of phospholipids) were mixed with unlabeled HDL (160 nmol of phospholipids) in the presence of either control or PLTP-containing cell culture media. Fluorescence intensities of the monomer and of the excimer were recorded at 378 and 475 nm, respectively, after 60-min incubation at 37 °C. The monomer/excimer (M/E) intensity ratio increased linearly as a function of both incubation time and PLTP amount. The increase in the M/E fluorescence intensity ratio thus represented a reliable measure of “inter-HDL” PLTP transfer activity. M/E intensity ratios measured with mock medium were used as blank values and subtracted for specific activity calculations. Conversion of HDL particles was analyzed by incubating either control or PLTP-containing cell culture media with HDL particles (5 μg of protein) for 30 h at 37 °C. The final incubation volume was 0.6 ml, and the ratio of PLTP activity/HDL concentration was similar to that in plasma. After incubation, HDL subclasses were separated by density gradient ultracentrifugation in a salt-sucrose gradient. The gradient was prepared in 12-ml polyallomer tubes (Beckman) and consisted of 0.5 g of sucrose, 5 ml of 4m NaCl, and 500 μl of sample, on which 6.2 ml of 0.67m NaCl was layered. Samples were centrifuged for 66 h in a SW 41 Ti rotor (Beckman) at 10 °C and 38,000 rpm. Fractions (500 μl) were collected using an auto-densiflow system (Searle, Fort Lee, NJ). Apolipoprotein AI (apoAI) was quantified in the fractions by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (33Rosseneu M. Bury J. Prog. Clin. Biol. Res. 1988; 255: 143-154PubMed Google Scholar). The percentage of apoAI released in the bottom fraction (d > 1.20 g/ml) of ultracentrifuged mixtures was used as a measure of the HDL size conversion activity of PLTP. The size distribution of HDL was determined by electrophoretic analysis on 4–20% polyacrylamide gradient gels, according to the general procedure previously described (34Blanche P.J. Gong E.L. Forte T.M. Nichols A.V. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1981; 665: 408-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar). The gel was run at 70 V during 1 h and then at 150 V for 20 h, in a 90 mm Tris-HCl, 80 mm boric acid, pH 8.3, buffer containing 3 mm Na-EDTA and 3 mmNaN3. At the end of the electrophoresis, gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue G. The size distribution profiles of HDL were obtained by analysis of stained gels on a Bio-Rad GS-670 imaging densitometer. The apparent diameters of HDL were determined by comparison with a calibration curve constructed with albumin (7.1 nm), lactate dehydrogenase (8.2 nm), ferritin (12.2 nm), and thyroglobulin (17.0 nm). Data are expressed as mean ± S.D. or mean ± S.E., as indicated in the legend of the figures. The statistical significance of differences between data means was determined using the Student'st test. In the aligned sequences of human CETP, LBP, BPI, and of pig, mouse, and human PLTP, shown in Fig. 1, only 22 residues are strictly conserved among all sequences. The sequence alignment of human PLTP and BPI shown in Fig. 1 is practically identical to that used by Huuskonen et al. (22Huuskonen J. Wohlfahrt G. Jauhiainen M. Ehnholm C. Teleman O. Olkonnen V.M. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 1123-1130Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) for the modeling of PLTP. As described by these authors (22Huuskonen J. Wohlfahrt G. Jauhiainen M. Ehnholm C. Teleman O. Olkonnen V.M. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 1123-1130Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), most secondary structure elements are well conserved within this protein family. Compared with the human BPI sequence, PLTP contains four deletions, which occur in the surface loops connecting β-strands and α-helices. Based on the BPI coordinates, a model was built for human PLTP (Fig. 2 A). The central part of the boomerang-shaped model structure of PLTP, containing the linker domain and the hypothetical lipid-binding pockets (22Huuskonen J. Wohlfahrt G. Jauhiainen M. Ehnholm C. Teleman O. Olkonnen V.M. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 1123-1130Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), is better conserved than the boomerang tips, which contain three of the four deletions. The N-terminal boomerang tip of BPI and LBP, consisting of loops 1, 2, and 4 and of helix α2 (as defined in Fig.1), contains several positively charged residues. These residues are not conserved in PLTP, because the corresponding region contains a hydrophobic cluster of aromatic residues, Tyr-45, Tyr-90, Trp-91, Phe-92, Phe-93, and Tyr-94 (Fig. 2 A). Fig. 2 (Band C) shows the electrostatic surface potentials around the BPI crystal structure and the PLTP model. Fig. 2 (D andE) shows the corresponding surface hydrophobicity around BPI and PLTP. The most striking difference between the BPI structure and the PLTP model lies within the N-terminal boomerang tip of the proteins. In this region, BPI shows a strongly positive electrostatic potential and low surface hydrophobicity (Fig. 2, B andD), whereas the corresponding region in PLTP has high surface hydrophobicity and a weakly positive electrostatic potential (Fig. 2, C and E). This is due to the replacement of positively charged residues of BPI by hydrophobic residues in PLTP (Fig. 1). Because the positively charged residues in the N-terminal boomerang tip of LBP are involved in binding of negatively charged LPS, we hypothesized that the corresponding hydrophobic region in PLTP might play a role in substrate binding through hydrophobic interactions. Fig.3 shows the conformation of the N-terminal tip of the PLTP model after optimization by molecular dynamics simulation. The aromatic residues Tyr-45, Tyr-90, Trp-91, Phe-92, Phe-93, and Tyr-94 are solvent-exposed, with solvent accessibility values of 0.56, 0.33, 0.59, 0.88, 0.65, and 0.52, respectively. These residues were separately mutated to an alanine.Figure 3Structure of the N-terminal tip of the PLTP molecule. This figure shows the clustering of aromatic residues Tyr-45, Tyr-90, Trp-91, Phe-92, Phe-93, and Tyr-94 at the N-terminal tip of the boomerang-shaped PLTP and the solvent-exposed orientation of Trp-91, Phe-92, and Phe-93 residues. The indexes of solvent exposure of the residues are indicated in parentheses.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The kinetics of PLTP secretion by COS-1 cells were monitored by assaying PLTP activity in the cell culture media 24, 48, 72, and 96 h after transfection. As shown in Fig. 4, a time-dependent increase in PLTP activity was observed in the culture media of transfected cells, with a maximal increase 72–96 h post-transfection. As PLTP mass was only detected 96 h after transfection by Western blot analysis of cell culture media, and all media were harvested 4 days post-transfection. The specific activity of recombinant wild-type (WT) PLTP expressed as activity/μg of PLTP protein was ∼60 nmol/μg/h, compared with about 100 nmol/μg/h for plasma PLTP. All PLTP mutants were efficiently expressed, at levels above 65% of WT PLTP. The concentration of recombinant PLTP in the cell culture media was around 1 μg/ml (0.9 ± 0.1, 0.6 ± 0.2, 0.6 ± 0.2, 1.0 ± 0.1, 1.0 ± 0.2, 0.9 ± 0.2, and 0.6 ± 0.1 μg/ml for WT, Y45A, Y90A, W91A, F92A, F93A, and Y94A mutants, respectively). The kinetic parameters for phospholipid transfer from liposomes to various lipoprotein substrates were measured for the engineered PLTP mutants. We first measured PLTP-mediated transfer of pyrene-labeled phosphatidylcholine from donor liposomes to HDL acceptors. The specific transfer activities of all mutants were calculated based upon the PLTP concentration in the media. Except for the Y45A and Y94A variants, whose specific activity was not statistically different from that of WT PLTP, all single point mutations substantially decreased PLTP-specific activity in the liposome/HDL transfer assay (Fig.5 A). The activity of the Y90A variant decreased most, because it amounted only to 30% that of WT PLTP. Mutations of residues Trp-91, Phe-92, and Phe-93 decreased the specific PLTP activity by up to 60%. To determine whether the reduced activity of the mutants was primarily due to their decreased interaction with liposomes and/or with HDL particles, we modified the liposome/HDL transfer assay into an HDL/HDL transfer assay. Pyrene-labeled HDL were used as phospholipid donors, unlabeled HDL were used as acceptors, and PLTP activity was quantified by measuring the decrease in excimer/monomer fluorescence intensity in HDL. The specific activities of WT and PLTP mutants in this assay system are shown in Fig. 5 B. They are well correlated with the activities measured with the liposomes/HDL transfe"

The regulation of PLD activity in vitro allowed the identification of four distinct mechanisms for stimulation of the enzymes.

Elucidation of these regulatory mechanisms and investigations to determine which of these pathways are utilized in the cellular milieu in response to extracellular stimuli have been reviewed (see Refs. 25Singer W.D.

The availability of the cloned enzymes has also resulted in multiple attempts to define interaction sites of PLD isozymes with different activators. Constructs of PLD1 missing the N-terminal third of the protein yield selective attenuation of regulation by PKC (28Park S.K. Min D.S. Exton J.H Biochem. Biophys. Res.

A site for interaction with Rho is located in the C-terminal third of the protein based on interaction of C-terminal regions of PLD1 with RhoA (31Yamazaki M. Zhang Y. Watanabe H. Yokozeki T. Ohno S.

The identification of catalytic portions of PLD1 benefited from homology of the enzyme with other lipid transferases (33Ponting C.P. Kerr I.D Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 914-922Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). The predicted participation of both conserved HKD (HXKXXXXDXXXXXXGXXN) motifs in catalytic function was verified by expression of mutagenized proteins (32Sung T.C. Roper R.L. Zhang Y. Rudge S.A.

Extensive mutagenesis in other regions of the protein has led to a variety of catalytically defective enzymes (30Zhang Y. Altshuller Y.M. Hammond S.M. Hayes F. Morris A.J. Frohman M.A EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6339-6348Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), but the role of altered regions in catalysis, stability of the enzyme, or regulation remains to be defined. Although modification of the N terminus of PLD1 allows apparent normal activity, modification of the C terminus of the mammalian PLD enzymes results in proteins that lack catalytic activity (29Sung T.C. Zhang Y. Morris A.J. Frohman M.A J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3659-3666Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). In this study, we demonstrate that PLD1 and PLD2 with alterations in the C terminus are inactive but functionally intact. Partial restoration of the activity of these mutant enzymes by addition of various peptides strongly suggests that the C-terminal threonine of these mammalian enzymes is a required component of the active site or functionally helps stabilize the active site for hydrolytic activity. Dipalmitoyl phosphatidylcholine (DPPC) and bovine brain phosphatidylethanolamine were purchased from Avanti. PIP2 was purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals.l-α-[choline-methyl-3H]Dipalmitoyl PC was purchased from DuPont. Peptides and modified peptides were synthesized by Genosys Biotechnologies or the biosynthesis facility of the Howard Hughes Medical Institute (University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX). Synthetic peptides were cross-linked to tuberculin-purified protein derivate (Statens Seruminstitut) with glutaraldehyde (34Lachmann P.J. Strangeways L. Vyakarnam A. Evan G. Ciba Found. Symp. 1986; 119: 25-57PubMed Google Scholar). The conjugates were used to immunize rabbits (35Mumby S.M. Kahn R.A. Manning D.R. Gilman A.G Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 265-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Sera were collected and screened by immunoblot analysis. Recombinant Arf proteins were expressed in bacteria and purified through two steps: batch elution from DEAE-Sephacel and a gel-filtration column as described (36Randazzo P.A. Weiss O. Kahn R.A Methods Enzymol. 1995; 257: 128-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). A plasmid encoding hexahistidine-tagged protein kinase Cα (6H-PKCα) was constructed using the polymerase chain reaction. Briefly, synthetic oligonucleotides encoding the amino acid sequence, NASMAGHHHHHHGALDR were inserted into the hinge region of the lepine PKCα gene in place of amino acids 307–327. 2W. D. Singer and P. C. Sternweis, manuscript in preparation. The 6H-PKCα was expressed in Sf9 cells following infection with recombinant baculovirus and purified through consecutive steps of nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid affinity and Hi-Trap heparin chromatography. The final purity of proteins was evaluated by separation on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (37Laemmli U.K Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar) and detection by staining with silver. Protein concentration was determined by staining with Amido Black (38Schaffner W. Weissmann C. Anal. Biochem. 1973; 56: 502-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (1954) Google Scholar). Wild-type and mutant PLD enzymes were expressed in Sf9 cells grown in monolayer. About 1 × 107 Sf9 cells were infected with 0.5 ml of high titer recombinant virus (∼1 × 108/ml) for 48 h. Cells were washed and harvested in buffer containing 20 mm NaHepes, pH 7.5, 1 mmEDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and protease inhibitors (21 μg/mlN α-p-tosyl-l-lysine chloromethyl ketone, 21 μg/ml tosylphenylalanyl chloromethyl ketone, 21 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 12.5 μg/ml pepstatin A, and 21 μg/mlN α-p-tosyl-l-arginine methyl ester). The particulate materials of cells were sedimented by centrifugation at 400 × g for 5 min. The pellets were resuspended in the same buffer, homogenized, and loaded into the bottom of centrifuge tubes. Two volumes of 2.5 m sucrose in the same solution were added to give a final concentration of 47% (w/v). This was overlaid with equal volumes of solutions containing 40% and 20% sucrose and the gradient was subjected to centrifugation at 80,000 × g for 60 min at 4 °C. Membranes that migrated to the interface between 20% and 40% sucrose were collected as the light membrane fraction enriched in PLD activity. Substrate vesicles made by gel filtration have proven to be more stable and provide lower background for measurement of PLD activities. The procedure given here will be presented in more detail elsewhere. 3X. Jiang, S. Gutowski, W. D. Singer and P. C. Sternweis, submitted for publication. A mixture of phosphatidylethanolamine (600 μm), PIP2 (30 μm), DPPC (60 μm), and [3H]DPPC (about 500 cpm/pmol) was prepared and dried under a stream of nitrogen. The lipids were resuspended in PLD reaction buffer (50 mm NaHepes, pH 7.5, 80 mm KCl, 3 mm EGTA, and 1 mm DTT) containing 1%n-octyl-α-d-glucopyranoside and sonicated for 2 min at room temperature to form mixed micelles. Vesicles were formed by gel-filtration of the micelles through a column (0.7 cm × 30 cm) of AcA34 (Biosepra), which had been equilibrated with PLD reaction buffer before loading. Fractions (∼300 μl each) were collected and the peak of radioactive vesicles pooled and used as substrate for the assay of PLD activity. The recovery of [3H]DPPC and unlabeled lipids was uniform and ranged from 30% to 40%. Except for the preparation of substrate vesicles, the assay of PLD activity was measured by the release of [3H]choline as described previously (6Brown H.A. Gutowski S. Moomaw C.R. Slaughter C. Sternweis P.C Cell. 1993; 75: 1137-1144Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (823) Google Scholar, 7Brown H.A. Sternweis P.C Methods Enzymol. 1995; 257: 313-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Briefly, aliquots of light membrane fractions were mixed in 30 μl of a buffer containing 50 mm NaHepes, pH 7.5, 80 mm KCl, 3 mm EGTA, 1 mm DTT, 3 mm MgCl2, 3 mm CaCl2, and 10 μm GTPγS. When indicated, Arf and PKCα were added to final concentrations of 5 μm and 50 nm, respectively. Reactions were started by the addition of substrate vesicles and incubated at 30 °C for 60–90 min. Reactions were stopped by the addition of 200 μl of 10% trichloroacetic acid and 100 μl of 10 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. Samples were centrifuged to remove precipitated lipids and proteins and the supernatants analyzed for released [3H]choline by liquid scintillation spectroscopy. Unless indicated otherwise, all assays represent the average of duplicate samples. The plasmid encoding human phospholipases D1 and D2 were kindly provided by Michael Frohman and Andrew Morris (8Hammond S.M. Altshuller Y.M. Sung T.C. Rudge S.A. Rose K. Engebrecht J. Morris A.J.

DNA encoding PLD1 was subcloned into pFastBacTHb vector (Life Technologies, Inc.), and the fragment from SphI to the C terminus of the coding region was deleted and replaced with mutated products generated by polymerase chain reactions. The 3′ primers used for PCR reactions contained mutations and new stop codons to give the altered amino acid sequences indicated. All mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Recombinant viruses were obtained by transformation of DH10Bac cells and selection by blue-white screening as described by the manufacturer. Viral DNA was isolated and used to transfect Sf9 cells for creation and amplification of baculoviruses encoding the mutated PLDs. Recombinant PLD1 that has been modified with 6 histidines at its C terminus was inactive when expressed in Sf9 cells (Fig. 1). Inactive enzyme was also obtained if the four C-terminal amino acids were deleted from the enzyme (PLD1-CΔ4). This inactivity is due to an apparent catalytic deficiency, as activity could be partially restored to the expressed enzymes by addition of peptides representing the C terminus of PLD1 (Fig. 1). Although the addition of peptides at millimolar concentrations had little effect on activity of the wild-type enzyme, peptide ST, which represents the last 15 amino acids of PLD1, restored about 15% of wild-type activity to both enzymes that had been modified at the C terminus. At higher concentrations, all of the peptides had inhibitory effects on the assay of PLD activity. A shorter peptide (PT) containing only the last 6 amino acids of the C terminus could also restore activity to the inactive enzymes but was less potent than the longer ST peptide. In contrast, a peptide (SA) representing amino acids that were N-terminal to peptide PT was ineffective. This indicates that the C-terminal residues of PLD1 play a crucial role in PLD activity. The concentrations of peptide that restore activity to mutationally compromised PLD are substantial, albeit specific. A more potent effect can be obtained if a myristoylated peptide is utilized. This is shown in Fig. 2. The acylated peptide shows an increase in potency of over 1000-fold but not a real increase in efficacy at the concentrations that can be utilized. The increase in potency can probably be attributed to localization of the peptide to the surface of substrate vesicles, thus allowing for more efficient competition of the peptide with the endogenous C terminus of PLD1. Further mutational analysis of PLD1 and PLD2 was done to investigate the role of C-terminal residues more fully. The mutant enzymes used in this study are described in Fig.3 A. All of the mutant enzymes could be expressed in Sf9 cells and were enriched in light membrane fractions. Antibodies used to detect the PLD1 proteins are described in Fig. 3 B, and the level of expression of each mutant is shown in Fig. 4 (Aand B). Antisera raised to peptides representing the N terminus (Q054) or two internal sequences of PLD1 (R654, R653) detected all of the expressed PLD1 enzymes (Fig. 4 A) but not PLD2. In contrast, antisera to a peptide representing the C terminus of PLD1 recognized both PLD1 and PLD2, but discriminated strongly among the constructs with mutations near the C terminus. The recognition of both PLD1 and PLD2 by C-terminal sera is indicative of their highly homologous C termini, whereas the N-terminal and internal peptides represent more divergent sequences between the two enzymes.Figure 4Immunological detection of PLD1, PLD1 mutants, PLD2, and PLD2 mutants. About 3 μg of membrane protein were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred onto nitrocellulose. A, transferred blots were immunoblotted with Q054 (anti-N terminus), R654 and R653 (anti-internal sequences), and Q056 and Q057 (anti-C terminus) antisera. B, blots were immunoblotted with antisera or “blocked” antisera. For blocking, 20 μl of antiserum were preincubated with 10 μl of 3 mmindicated peptide (ST referring to PLDpepST, SAreferring to PLDpepSA, and PT referring to PLDpepPT; see Fig. 1 for details) at 4 °C overnight. All sera were used for immunoblotting at final dilutions of 1:500.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The C-terminal directed antisera recognize the very C terminus of the molecule. This is demonstrated by competition of this interaction with a peptide (PLDpepPT) representing the last 6 amino acids of PLD1 but not with a peptide (PLDpepSA) that represents the N-terminal half of the peptide used for production of the antisera (Fig. 4 B). Further definition of this recognition is demonstrated by the mutant proteins. The C-terminal antisera did not detect proteins that had either deletions at the C terminus or the addition of either a 6-histidine tag (PLD1) or a single alanine residue (PLD2). In addition, mutation of the C-terminal tryptophan to alanine or the C-terminal threonine to lysine, glutamic acid, or alanine resulted in failure of recognition by the antisera. Only two conservative mutations in these residues, W1073F and T1074S, resulted in retention of detection. In total, these results suggest that the recognition site for the C-terminal antigenic region includes a hydrophobic pocket for the tryptophan and recognition of the threonine's hydroxyl group and C-terminal carboxyl moiety. The latter is suggested by the failure of the antisera to recognize the enzymes with residues added to the C terminus. The activities of various recombinant PLD1 enzymes are shown in Fig. 5 A. Preparations derived from either expression of PLD1 containing the K466A mutation, which prevents catalytic activity, or expression of G protein βγ subunits, provide controls for measurement of endogenous Sf9 PLD activity in these preparations of membranes. Truncation of the last two or four amino acids yielded inactive enzyme. Of six point mutations in the two C-terminal amino acids, three resulted in inactive proteins while three retained partial activity. Modification of tryptophan to phenylalanine was tolerated very well, but substitution of alanine in this position resulted in total loss of activity. This indicates that the aromatic residue is important for C-terminal function. Replacement of Thr-1074 with either serine or alanine allowed expression of about 20% of wild type activity. In contrast, substitution of this threonine with the charged residues, lysine or glutamic acid, completely attenuated activity of the enzyme. Restoration by peptide of ∼20% of wild type activity to the inactive truncated proteins, PLD1-CΔ2 and PLD1-CΔ4, PLD1-W1073A, and PLD1-CHis6 indicates the these enzymes are expressed in a functionally intact form but are unable to maintain an active catalytic site. The inability of the peptide to restore activity to the PLD1-T1074K and PLD1-T1074E mutants may reflect the production of incorrectly folded protein but more likely reflects an inability of the peptide to compete with a more stable association of the endogenous C terminus (see “Discussion”). The addition of a C-terminal peptide to expressed enzymes with endogenous activity resulted in inhibitions of about 15–30%; this is due to use of the peptide at concentrations optimal for measuring restoration of activity to inactive proteins but at which inhibitory effects are beginning to be observed with wild type enzyme. Use of even higher concentrations of peptide will cause nonspecific inhibition of activities observed with both wild-type and restored enzymes. Two mutations in the C terminus of PLD2 also attenuated activity of the enzyme. In both cases, addition of the C-terminal peptide could restore up to 30% of wild type activity. In the case of PLD2, activity is restored to enzyme assayed in the presence of PIP2. Wild type PLD1 has a lower activity in the presence of PIP2 and can be strongly activated by the small G protein, Arf, or PKCα. Fig.6 A shows that peptide could effectively restore stimulation by either regulatory molecule to catalytically compromised enzymes. These results indicate that the role of the C terminus in catalysis by the PLD isozymes is fundamental to activity and not selectively employed by these differential regulators of the enzymes. Involvement of the C terminus with Rho appears more complex. Restoration of stimulation by RhoA can also be observed (Fig.6 B), but the lower efficacy of Rho makes these observations difficult and the extent of restoration relative to Arf and PKCα cannot be adequately assessed. However, some deficiency in the ability of RhoA to activate PLDs with C-terminal disruptions is indicated by the failure of RhoA to synergize with PKCα when the deficient enzymes are restored with peptide (Fig. 6 C). Although this may indicate that Rho directly uses the intact C terminus to partially effect stimulation of activity, it is also consistent with an indirect role in which anchoring of the C-terminal residues is important to help stabilize other proximal elements of the protein which mediate regulation by Rho. A modest tolerance for change in the C-terminal threonine but the complete attenuation of activity by the attachment of a hexahistidine tag or alanine to this residue suggested that the α-carboxyl group of the threonine was functionally important. Therefore, amidated peptides were tested for their ability to restore activity to inactive enzymes (Fig. 7). Amidation of the C terminus of either the shorter or longer C-terminal peptides inhibited their ability to restore activity to inactive mutants of PLD1. The results with mutations in the C termini of mammalian PLD1 and PLD2 indicate the fundamental role of this portion of the molecule in the catalytic action of these enzymes. We hypothesize that C-terminal residues stabilize a functional conformation of the active site. This may occur through interaction with residues directly involved in catalysis or with residues more remotely involved in formation of the site. The catalytic core of PLD is predicted to form around the conserved HKD motifs (33Ponting C.P. Kerr I.D Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 914-922Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar, 39Waite M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1439: 187-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The structure of Nuc, a bacterial endonuclease belonging to the superfamily of enzymes with these motifs, consists of a dimer in which the individual HKD motifs of the monomeric polypeptides interact in the dimeric molecule to form the active site (40Stuckey J.A. Dixon J.E Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 278-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). The recent structure of the PLD from Streptomyces sp. strain PMF confirms the coordinated interaction of two HKD motifs within a single polypeptide to form the catalytic site (41Leiros I. Secundo F. Zambonelli C. Servi S. Hough E. Struct. Fold. Des. 2000; 8: 655-667Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Such coordination of the two motifs in the mammalian PLD enzymes is supported by mutagenesis experiments (32Sung T.C. Roper R.L. Zhang Y. Rudge S.A. Temel R. Hammond S.M. Morris A.J. Moss B. Engebrecht J. Frohman M.A EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4519-4530Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar) and the evolution of PLD activity when the N-terminal and C-terminal halves of PLD1 were coexpressed but not when either half (single HKD domain) was expressed alone (42Xie Z. Ho W.T. Exton J.H J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34679-34682Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). One potential role for the C-terminal residues would be to stabilize the interaction between these domains. If so, partial restoration of activity by the free peptide indicates that the mechanism for such stabilization would not be a simple tethering of one domain to the other. The discovery that peptides representing the C terminus can restore partial activity to inactive enzymes suggests a more localized function for the C terminus. It is likely that the mechanism for this restoration is binding of the peptide to a site normally occupied by the endogenous C terminus of the enzyme. To achieve this, peptides would have to compete with the endogenous C terminus, which will have a competitive edge by virtue of its attachment to the rest of the enzyme. Such a mechanism also indicates that positioning of the C terminus in the enzyme must be flexible. The inability of the peptides to fully restore activity may reflect an inability to use peptides at sufficiently high concentrations and transient interactions of the peptides with functional residues. Alternately, correct positioning of the endogenous C terminus may also have more global conformational effects on the active site that cannot be mimicked by the independent peptides. One possibility is that the C terminus of one PLD molecule interacts with the active site of a second PLD molecule. Thus, the active enzyme would be a dimer and two enzymes with dissimilar mutations might be complementary. Although this mechanism could exist, complementation by coexpression of PLD1-K466A with PLD1-CHis6 was not observed (data not shown). The importance of the last two residues of the PLD1 C terminus has been shown by mutagenesis and reconstitution; specific roles for other upstream residues have not been explored. Elimination of the hydrophobic side chain of tryptophan 1073 (PLD1-W1073A) results in complete loss of activity. It is possible that the aromatic group helps position residues in the catalytic site or that its interaction with a specific site in the enzyme helps stabilize positioning of the C-terminal threonine for effective interaction. A role in stable positioning of the C terminus is attractive in light of the ability of peptides to restore partial function of the W1073A mutant. The inability of amidated peptides to restore activity to inactive enzymes indicates a requirement for an intact C-terminal α-carboxyl group. It is possible that this carboxyl group participates directly in catalytic action of the enzyme. However, conservation of the HKD motifs (HXKXXXXDXXXXXXGXXN) and structural data from Nuc (40Stuckey J.A. Dixon J.E Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 278-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar) suggest that all of the amino acid residues directly involved in catalysis are in place. It is more likely that the C-terminal carboxyl group may be stabilizing or activating catalytic residues through salt bridges or hydrogen bonds. In the structure of Nuc (40Stuckey J.A. Dixon J.E Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 278-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar), both serines of the HKD motifs (GSXN) contribute symmetrically to stabilization of the active site. In the mammalian PLD isozymes, the serine position in the first HKD motif is a glycine, suggesting a significant departure in structure from this homologous core domain. It is tempting to speculate that the C-terminal threonine could supply this role in PLD1. However, the partial activity of the enzyme when alanine occupies this position rules out this role for the hydroxyl group and such a functional role would depend on interactions through the α-carboxyl moiety. A second invariant residue of interest in the HKD motif is the aspartyl residue. In Nuc, this residue is located more than 25 Å from the catalytic action but appears through several hydrogen bonds to help stabilize structural elements containing residues in the active site (40Stuckey J.A. Dixon J.E Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 278-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Interaction of the C terminus of PLD with one of the conserved aspartyl residues may then influence the active site from a distance. Two putative PLD enzymes from Drosophila melanogaster andCaenorhabditis elegans retain C-terminal motifs similar to the mammalian enzymes. However, the C termini from PLD enzymes found in the fungi, Saccharomyces cerevisiae (PMEIYN) andCandida albicans (PMEIYD), depart from this consensus by incorporating a C-terminal residue that would not function in the mammalian protein. In these yeast enzymes, the tyrosine residue could provide the same hydrophobic anchor proposed for the mammalian tryptophan and a free α-carboxyl group from the asparagine or aspartic acid could fulfill the requirement of the last amino acid. However, compensatory changes in the surfaces of the enzymes with which these C termini interact would presumably be required to accommodate the different side chains of these C-terminal residues. The C termini of identified PLDs in bacteria and plants are much more variable. This and overall differences in structural components and regulatory properties of the latter enzymes probably indicate that the functional requirement of the C terminus defined for the mammalian enzymes will not be a conserved feature in the broader family of PLD enzymes. A requirement for interaction of C-terminal residues with the rest of the protein for expression of enzymatic activity offers great opportunity for regulation. Stabilization of this interaction would yield increased activity of the enzyme, whereas disruption would inhibit activity. Enhancement of interaction of the C terminus with the active site would be a means for one or more activators of PLD1 to exert their stimulatory effects, especially synergism observed by combinations of activators (16Singer W.D.

However, the absence of activity in C-terminal mutants, the uniform recovery of stimulation by other activators in the presence of peptide, and similar behavior by PLD2 suggest this is not a major regulatory paradigm. Alternatively, a potential mechanism for inhibition or down-regulation of PLD could involve binding of an inhibitory molecule to or modification of the C terminus such that interaction of the C-terminal residues with the active site was disrupted. The similarity of C-terminal regulation in both PLD1 and PLD2 makes this a potential common site to attenuate both PLD pathways in a cell. We thank Dr. William Singer for help with the manuscript."

These factors include both the number of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs)1 present in the postsynaptic membrane and the proportion of these receptors that exist in active versus inactive conformations. For example, the nAChR in native Torpedo membranes exists in at least two distinct conformations: a low affinity closed (resting) and a high affinity inactive (desensitized) state. In the absence of acetylcholine, the equilibrium between these two strongly favors the resting state with only ∼20% adopting the desensitized conformation (1Heidmann T. Changeux J.-P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1979; 94: 255-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 2Boyd N.D. Cohen J.B. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 5334-5353Google Scholar, 3Boyd N.D. Cohen J.B. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 5353-5358Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Prolonged exposure to acetylcholine, however, shifts the equilibrium in favor of the desensitized conformation, thus diminishing the postsynaptic response. The magnitude of the cation flux can be modulated further by endogenous factors including receptor phosphorylation (4Huganir R.L. Delcour A.H. Greengard P. Hess G.P.

Chem. 2000; 275: 777-784Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), which influence the proportion of nAChRs in the resting versus desensitized state and/or the kinetics of the resting-to-desensitized conformational transition. The flux response elicited by acetylcholine is also affected by a class of structurally diverse exogenous compounds collectively referred to as noncompetitive blockers (NCBs). NCBs of the nAChR include both general and local anesthetics, the hallucinogenic drug phencyclidine hydrochloride (PCP), and the frog toxin histrionicotoxin (7Heidmann T. Changeux J.-P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1978; 47: 371-411Crossref Scopus (249) Google Scholar, 8Arias H.R. Mol. Membr. Biol. 1996; 13: 1-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). These compounds sterically inhibit cation flux through the nAChR. In some cases, they also modulate the affinity of the nAChR for acetylcholine. PCP and the local anesthetics dibucaine, prilocaine, lidocaine, and proadifen increase the affinity of the nAChR for acetylcholine and are thought to stabilize the desensitized state (9Heidmann T. Oswald R.E. Changeux J.-P. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 3112-3127Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 10Krodel E.K. Beckman R.A. Cohen J.B. Mol. Pharmacol. 1979; 15: 294-312PubMed Google Scholar). Other local anesthetics such as tetracaine and adiphenine decrease the affinity of the nAChR for acetylcholine and are thought to shift the equilibrium in favor of the resting state (11Boyd N.D. Cohen J.B. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 4023-4033Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Most NCBs also bind with comparable affinity to the neurotransmitter site as well as to numerous low affinity sites on the periphery of the nAChR (9Heidmann T. Oswald R.E. Changeux J.-P. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 3112-3127Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). The conformational effects, if any, that result from binding to the latter are not well characterized. We previously examined the structural consequences of local anesthetic binding to the nAChR using FTIR difference spectroscopy (12Ryan S.E. Baenziger J.E. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 55: 348-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The difference between spectra of the nAChR recorded in the presence and absence of the agonist carbamylcholine (referred to as a Carb difference spectrum) exhibits a complex pattern of positive and negative bands that provides a spectral map of the structural changes that occur upon Carb binding and desensitization (12Ryan S.E. Baenziger J.E. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 55: 348-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 13Baenziger J.E. Miller K.W. Rothschild K.J.

J. 1992; 61: 983-992Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Carb difference spectra recorded in the presence of the desensitizing local anesthetics dibucaine, prilocaine, and lidocaine all exhibit a pattern of band intensity changes that is consistent with the formation of a desensitized nAChR. The spectral changes, however, indicate that local anesthetic-induced desensitization occurs upon binding to the neurotransmitter as opposed to the NCB site. The data also suggest that NCB-site binding may lead to the formation of a conformation that is a structural intermediate between the resting and desensitized states, as opposed to the normally assumed desensitized state. Unfortunately, the overlapping binding affinities of the studied local anesthetics for the NCB and neurotransmitter binding sites prevented an unequivocal assessment of the structural changes elicited upon binding specifically to the ion channel pore. The potential existence of a conformation that is a structural intermediate between the resting and desensitized states has important implications for our understanding of both nAChR conformational equilibria and the mechanisms of agonist-induced conformational change. An intermediate conformation in vivo could also play a role in the modulation of a postsynaptic response. To determine unequivocally whether or not such a conformational intermediate does exist, we probe here using both FTIR difference spectroscopy and the conformationally sensitive chemical probe, [125I]TID, the structural changes induced in the nAChR by two NCBs, proadifen and PCP, that have distinct affinities for the NCB and neurotransmitter binding sites. Our data show conclusively that the binding of either proadifen or PCP to the NCB site leads to the formation of a conformation that is distinct from either the resting or the desensitized states of the nAChR. In contrast, binding to the neurotransmitter site leads to full desensitization. A revised model of nAChR conformational equilibria is presented. NAChR-rich membranes were prepared by sucrose density centrifugation as described by Chiara and Cohen (15Chiara D.C Cohen J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32940-32950Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Affinity purification and reconstitution of the nAChR into membranes composed of 3:1:1 egg phosphatidylcholine:dioleoylphosphatidic acid:cholesterol was as described by McCarthy and Moore (16McCarthy M.P. Moore M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7655-7663Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). TheTorpedo electric organ was purchased from either Aquatic Research Consultants (San Pedro, CA) or Marinus, Inc. (Long Beach, CA). Egg phosphatidylcholine and dioleoylphosphatidic acid were both from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL). Cholesterol, Carb, and dibucaine were from Sigma. PCP was either a gift from Health Canada or was purchased from Sigma/RBI FTIR spectra were recorded using the ATR technique on an FTS-40 spectrometer equipped with a DTGS detector. Each spectrum was recorded at 8 cm−1resolution using 512 scans, which took roughly 7 min per spectrum. All difference spectra were base-line-corrected between 1800 and 1000 cm−1 and were interpolated to an effective resolution of 4 cm−1. The presented spectra are averages of between 30 and 70 difference spectra recorded, for each experiment, from at least two new films prepared from each affinity purification/reconstitution. Carb difference spectra were recorded as described in detail elsewhere (12Ryan S.E. Baenziger J.E. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 55: 348-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Briefly, two consecutive resting state spectra of an nAChR film deposited on the surface of a germanium internal reflection element were recorded in the absence of Carb with buffer (250 mmNaCl, 5 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 3 mm CaCl2, and 10 mm Tris, pH 7.0) flowing continuously through the sample compartment of the ATR cell at a rate of ∼1.5 ml/min (see schematic in Ref. 12Ryan S.E. Baenziger J.E. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 55: 348-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The flowing solution was switched to an identical one containing 50 μm Carb and after 1 min a spectrum recorded of the desensitized state. The differences between both the two resting state spectra (absence of Carb; control spectra) and the consecutive resting and desensitized (presence of Carb) state spectra were calculated, stored, and the flowing buffer switched back to buffer without Carb. After a 20-min washing period to remove Carb from the film and convert the nAChR back into the resting conformation, the process was repeated many times. Both proadifen- and PCP-induced structural changes in the nAChR were monitored by recording Carb difference spectra while maintaining the nAChR in continuous contact with either proadifen or PCP (Fig. 1,bottom schematic). The structural changes that result from PCP binding to the NCB site were also monitored by recording spectra of the nAChR in the presence and absence of PCP, referred to as PCP difference spectra. The PCP difference spectra were recorded as described above for the Carb difference spectra, except that PCP was used instead of Carb to induce the conformational change (Fig. 1, middle schematic). The measurement of difference band intensity changes for plotting dose-response curves is difficult because of base-line distortions that can occur in the 1500–1800 cm−1 region as a result of nAChR film instability and temperature fluctuations. Distortions are particularly evident in difference spectra recorded at high concentrations of proadifen, because partitioning of large amounts of this NCB into the bilayer leads to nAChR film instability. Extensive studies have shown that the difference intensity near 1700, 1680, 1637, and 1530 cm−1 is at or near base line, as is evident in the difference spectra recorded at low concentrations of proadifen (Fig. 2, arrows in the second trace from bottom). In contrast, higher concentrations of proadifen lead to base-line distortions and an apparent increase in intensity at each of these frequencies (Fig. 3,arrows in the second trace frombottom). Peak heights were measured relative to the intensity at an adjacent frequency that is close to the base line and that, based on experience, is not affected by NCB binding to the nAChR. The intensity centered at 1655 cm−1 was measured relative to 1637 cm−1 and is referred to as the 1655/1637 cm−1 ratio. The changes in positive intensity at 1663 cm−1 were best quantified by measuring the changes in negative intensity near 1668 cm−1 relative to 1680 cm−1 and is referred to as the 1668/1680 cm−1 ratio. The binding of proadifen to the neurotransmitter sites was quantified by integrating the intensity of the negative proadifen band centered near 1740 cm−1.Figure 3Selected regions of Carb difference spectra recorded in the presence of the noted concentrations of proadifen consistent with proadifen binding to both the NCB and neurotransmitter sites. The short dashed lines denote positive intensity in the difference spectra that reflects specifically the resting-to-desensitized conformational change (see text).Long dashed lines denote the frequencies at which proadifen itself absorbs infrared light. The negative features at these frequencies in the difference spectra corresponds to the binding of proadifen to the neurotransmitter site (see text and bottom schematic in Fig. 1). The lowest trace is an absorbance spectrum of proadifen as in Fig. 2. Arrows on the second trace from bottom designate frequencies which are typically at or close to the base line, but are distorted to follow a rainbow-like pattern between 1700 and 1500 cm−1 because of nAChR film instability at high concentrations of proadifen (see “Experimental Procedures”). The Carb difference spectrum recorded at 100 μm proadifen (dashed line) is superimposed with a slighty axis offset on the Carb difference spectrum recorded at 400 μm proadifen (solid line,second trace from bottom).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) For photolabeling experiments, Torpedo nAChR-rich membranes (1 mg/ml in Vesicle Dialysis Buffer (10 mm MOPS, 100 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 0.02% NaN3, pH 7.5) were incubated for 2 h at room temperature with [125I]TID (0.4 μm) in the absence or presence of 400 μm Carb, or PCP at various concentrations. In some experiments nAChR-rich membranes were pre-equilibrated with 10 μm α-bungarotoxin for 20 min prior to the addition of PCP, and in some experiments affinity-purified nAChRs reconstituted into asolectin-lipid vesicles were substituted for nAChR-rich membranes. Incubations were performed in 10 × 75-mm glass culture tubes in the dark. The samples were then irradiated with a 365-nm UV lamp (Spectroline EN-280L) for 7 min at a distance of <1 cm, the membrane suspensions transferred to 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tubes and centrifuged at 39,000 × g for 1 h. Pellets were solubilized in electrophoresis sample buffer and nAChR subunits resolved by SDS-PAGE (26Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207211) Google Scholar) using 1.0-mm-thick separating gels comprising 8% polyacrylamide, 0.33% bisacrylamide. Following electrophoresis, gels were stained with Coomassie Blue R-250, dried, and autoradiographs prepared using Kodak X-Omat LS film at −80 °C in the presence of an intensifying screen (15-h exposure). [125I]TID incorporation into AChR subunits was quantified by excising the bands from the dried gel and determining the amount of125I by counting in a Packard Cobra II Gamma counter. The concentration-response data were curve-fitted by nonlinear least-squares analysis using the graphical curve-fitting program Prism (Graphpad Software, Inc.). The difference between infrared spectra of the nAChR recorded in the presence and absence of the agonist Carb exhibits a complex pattern of positive and negative bands that provides a vibrational map of the Carb-induced structural change (Fig. 1, top trace) (13Baenziger J.E. Miller K.W. Rothschild K.J. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 5448-5454Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 25Baenziger J.E. Miller K.W. Rothschild K.J. Biophys. J. 1992; 61: 983-992Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). These difference bands reflect specifically the vibrations of nAChR-bound Carb, as well as vibrational changes associated with both the formation of physical interactions between Carb and the nAChR and the Carb-induced resting-to-desensitized conformational transition (Fig. 1, top schematic) (6Baenziger J.E.

A vibrational map of NCB-induced structural change could similarly be obtained by calculating the difference between spectra of the nAChR recorded in the presence and absence of a NCB (referred to as a NCB difference spectrum; Fig. 1, middle schematic). Unfortunately, the bands of interest in NCB difference spectra are usually masked by overlapping bands due to the partitioning of the NCB into the lipid bilayer and a consequent expansion of the nAChR film on the germanium optical element, as shown for the NCB dibucaine in Fig. 1(middle trace; note that PCP is an exception, see below). An alternative approach is to record Carb difference spectra while maintaining the nAChR in continuous contact with the NCB of interest, as shown for dibucaine (Fig. 1, lowest schematic and trace). Although the resulting difference spectra do not provide a direct map of the NCB-induced structural change, they are informative because NCBs influence both the equilibrium between the resting and desensitized states and in turn the affinity of the nAChR for Carb. As Carb difference spectra exhibit bands that reflect both the resting-to-desensitized conformational change and the formation of physical interactions between Carb and the nAChR, NCB-induced variations in Carb difference band intensity provide insight into the structural basis of NCB action at the nAChR. Carb difference spectra recorded in the presence of proadifen exhibit changes in the intensities of a number of difference bands that reflect structural consequences of proadifen binding to the nAChR. In particular, proadifen leads to dose-dependent decreases in the intensities of five bands, centered near 1663, 1655, 1547, 1430, and 1059 cm−1, which serve as markers of the resting-to-desensitized conformational transition (12Ryan S.E. Baenziger J.E. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 55: 348-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar,14Ryan S.E. Demers C.N. Chew J.P. Baenziger J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24590-24597Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Bands centered near 1663 and 1655 cm−1are in the amide I region (predominantly peptide C=O stretch) and are coupled to the 1547 cm−1 amide II vibration (predominantly peptide N-H bend). All three likely reflect a conformational change in the polypeptide backbone upon desensitization. The bands centered near 1430 (not shown) and 1059 cm−1 remain to be assigned, but likely reflect a structural change in individual side chains. Spectral changes that occur at proadifen concentrations up to 50 μm, where binding is restricted to the NCB site (K d ∼ 3 μm), are presented in Fig.2. Those that occur at proadifen concentrations between 100 and 400 μm Carb, where additional binding occurs at the neurotransmitter site (K d ∼ 400 μm), are presented in Fig.3 (17Blanchard S.G. Elliot J. Raferty M.A. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 5880-5885Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The dose-dependent spectral changes are summarized in Fig. 6. The binding of proadifen to the NCB site leads to a loss of intensity in three of the five conformationally sensitive bands centered near 1663, 1547, and 1059 cm−1 (Fig. 2). The loss of intensity near 1663 is best monitored as a change in the 1668/1680 cm−1 intensity ratio (see “Experimental Procedures”). Both the decrease in the 1668/1680 cm−1 ratio and loss of intensity centered near 1059 cm−1 are maximal at 50 μmproadifen, whereas additional changes in intensity near 1547 cm−1 are observed at higher proadifen concentrations (see below). The decrease in the 1668/1680 cm−1 ratio and loss of intensity centered near 1059 cm−1 indicate that the conformationally sensitive residues vibrating at 1663 and 1059 cm−1 are not able to undergo the resting-to-desensitized conformational change upon the binding of Carb. The simplest interpretation is that proadifen binding to the NCB site stabilizes the conformationally sensitive residues vibrating at these two frequencies in a desensitized conformation prior to the addition of Carb (see below). In contrast, positive band intensity centered near 1655 and 1430 cm−1 (latter not shown) is essentially unaffected by concentrations of proadifen up to 50 μm. A change in intensity at 1655 cm−1 is best monitored as a change in the 1655/1637 cm−1ratio. At 50 μm proadifen, the conformationally active residues that vibrate near 1655 and 1430 cm−1retain the ability to undergo a Carb-induced resting-to-desensitized conformational change and must therefore remain in a resting-like conformation despite the presence of bound proadifen. The contrasting effects of proadifen on the intensities of the conformationally sensitive bands near 1663/1059 cm−1 and 1655/1430 cm−1 suggest that the binding of proadifen to the NCB site shifts some nAChR residues into a desensitized-like conformation while others remain in a resting-like state. Proadifen binding to the NCB site thus leads to the formation of a conformation of the nAChR that is an intermediate between the resting and desensitized states and that shares structural features in common with both conformations. Higher concentrations of proadifen lead to additional changes in the Carb difference spectra, although these are slightly distorted by a broad positive artifact between 1700 and 1500 cm−1 due to increasing instability of the nAChR film at higher proadifen concentrations (Fig. 3). Regardless of these distortions, it is clear that concentrations of proadifen between 100 and 400 μm lead to a substantial decrease in the 1655/1637 cm−1 ratio and a loss of intensity near 1547 and 1430 cm−1. These intensity changes are most easily visualized upon superimposition of the difference spectra recorded at 100 and 400 μm proadifen (Fig. 3, see dashed line spectrum). No additional intensity changes were consistently detected near either 1663 or 1059 cm−1. The decrease in the 1655/1637 cm−1 ratio and loss of intensity near 1547 and 1430 cm−1 can be attributed to changes in nAChR structure resulting from proadifen binding to the neurotransmitter site. This interpretation is based on the known K d of proadifen for the neurotransmitter site (17Blanchard S.G. Elliot J. Raferty M.A. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 5880-5885Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) as well as the appearance of negative band intensity in the difference spectra (Fig. 3, long dashed lines) at frequencies that match the molecular vibrations of proadifen itself. These negative bands reflect the competitive displacement of proadifen from the neurotransmitter site upon the addition of Carb (Fig. 1, see bottom schematic). In addition, there appear to be subtle changes in the intensities of two bands near 1620 and 1516 cm−1. The latter spectral changes likely result from an ability of proadifen to mimic some of the physical interactions that normally occur between Carb and neurotransmitter binding site residues (12Ryan S.E. Baenziger J.E. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 55: 348-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The absence of positive intensity at the five noted conformationally sensitive frequencies centered near 1663, 1655, 1547, 1430, and 1059 cm−1 in Carb difference spectra recorded at elevated concentrations of proadifen indicates that the additional binding of proadifen to the neurotransmitter site completely abolishes the ability of the nAChR to undergo the Carb-induced resting-to-desensitized conformational transition. In agreement with data obtained for several other NCBs (12Ryan S.E. Baenziger J.E. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 55: 348-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), the binding of proadifen to the neurotransmitter site thus stabilizes the nAChR in a fully desensitized state. Note that the proadifen-sensitive vibration near 1547 cm−1 is a multicomponent band that is coupled to the two vibrations near 1663 and 1655 cm−1. The coupling of these vibrations explains why changes in nAChR structure reflected by a loss of intensity near 1547 cm−1 occur as a consequence of proadifen binding to both the NCB and neurotransmitter binding sites. Additional evidence for the existence of a conformational intermediate between the resting and desensitized states of the nAChR was obtained from both Carb difference spectra recorded in the presence of PCP and direct PCP difference spectra. PCP binds to the pore of the ion channel with dissociation constants of 1–6 μm, whereas binding to the neurotransmitter site is relatively weak (K d ∼ 250 μm) (9Heidmann T. Oswald R.E. Changeux J.-P. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 3112-3127Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 18White B.H. Howard S. Cohen S.G. Cohen J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21595-21607Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Carb difference spectra recorded while maintaining the nAChR in continuous contact with PCP at concentrations consistent with NCB site binding exhibit the same spectral changes observed upon proadifen binding to the NCB site, although the changes are less pronounced (Fig.4). The presence of PCP reduces both the 1668/1680 cm−1 ratio and the positive band intensity near 1547 and 1059 cm−1, but has no effect on the 1655/1637 cm−1 ratio or the positive band intensity near 1430 cm−1 (Fig.6). As with proadifen, PCP binding to the NCB site stabilizes the conformationally sensitive residues that vibrate near 1663 and 1059 cm−1 in a desensitized-like state, whereas those that vibrate near 1655 and 1430 cm−1remain in a resting-like conformation. Note that the PCP-induced changes in intensity near 1663 and 1059 cm−1are, as expected, small compared with those induced by proadifen (Fig.2). In contrast to proadifen, saturation of PCP binding to the NCB site leads to only a modest shift of the nAChR into a high affinity binding conformation. The relatively minor effects of PCP on both the Carb difference spectra and nAChR agonist binding affinity is likely a consequence of the only slight preference of PCP for the desensitized (K d ∼ 1 μm) versus resting (K d ∼ 6 μm) states (9Heidmann T. Oswald R.E. Changeux J.-P. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 3112-3127Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar,18White B.H. Howard S. Cohen S.G. Cohen J."

We reported previously that the 24–22-kDa FGF-2 forms inhibit the migration of endothelial and MCF-7 cells by 50% and 70%, respectively. Here we show that this inhibition of migration is mediated by the estrogen receptor (ER). We have found that depletion of the receptor in either cell line abrogates the inhibitory activity of 24-kDa FGF-2 while re-introduction of the ER into deficient cells once again promotes the inhibitory response. To determine whether exposure to 24-kDa FGF-2 resulted in the activation of the estrogen receptor, 3T3 cells were cotransfected with estrogen receptor cDNA and an estrogen regulatory element-luciferase gene reporter construct and treated with 24- and 18-kDa FGF-2. The high molecular weight form stimulated luciferase activity 5-fold while 18-kDa FGF-2 at the same concentration had no effect. Treatment of ER-positive MCF-7 cells transfected with the reporter construct only showed the same results. Inclusion of the pure estrogen antagonist ICI 182,780 blocked the increase in luciferase activity by 24-kDa FGF-2, further indicating that the response was estrogen receptor dependent. Expression of dominant negative FGF receptor 1 inhibited ER activation, indicating that this was the cell surface receptor mediating the effect. Although growth factor-dependent activation of the ER was reported to require mitogen-activated protein kinase-induced phosphorylation at Ser118 in COS and HeLa cells, this mechanism is not involved with the activation by 24-kDa FGF-2. These results suggest that the addition of 55 amino acids to the amino-terminal end of 18-kDa FGF-2 by alternative translation alters FGF-2 function and allows for the activation of a second signaling pathway involving the estrogen receptor.

This results in the synthesis of 4 FGF-2 isoforms of 24, 22.5, 22, and 18 kDa (1Moscatelli D. Joseph-Silverstein J. Presta M. Rifkin D.B.

The cellular localization and apparent functions of 18 kDa and the three higher molecular weight forms of FGF-2 (hmwFGF-2) differ. The 18-kDa FGF-2 is mostly cytoplasmic and is exported to the cell surface, where it is localized to the basement membrane or extracellular matrix in association with matrix heparins and heparans (3Miao H.-Q.

N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1991; 638: 177-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). In contrast, undetectable or extremely low levels of hmwFGF-2 are present in the media of cultured cells, suggesting that hmwFGF-2 is not released from cells. Instead, the majority of the cellular hmwFGF-2 is directly translocated into the nucleus (5Renko M. Quarto N. Morimoto T. Rifkin D.B. J. Cell. Physiol. 1990; 144: 108-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar, 6Amalric F. VBaldin V. Bosc-Bierne I. Bugler B. Couderc B. Guyader M. Patry V. Prats H. Roman A.M. Bouche G. Ann. N. Y. Acad.

The residues associated with nuclear translocation are RG repeats found at several sites within the amino-terminal region of hmwFGF-2 (7Rifkin D.B. Moscatelli D. Roghani M. Nagano Y. Quarto N. Klein S. Bikfalvi A. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 1994; 39: 102-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) that is absent from the 18-kDa FGF-2 form. Potential differences in function have also been reported for the 18-kDa versus the hmwFGF-2 forms. Transfection and expression of 18-kDa FGF-2 in 3T3 cells results in increased growth, motility, and levels of surface β1integrins. In contrast, 3T3 cells transfected with the cDNA for hmwFGF-2 show enhanced growth but no increase in migration nor integrin expression (8Quarto N. Talarico D. Florkiewicz R. Rifkin D.B. Cell Regul. 1991; 2: 669-708Crossref Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 9Klein S. Giancotti F.G. Presta M. Albelda S.M. Buck C.A. Rifkin D.B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 973-982Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Additionally, PC12 cells overexpressing 18-kDa FGF-2 were found to differentiate toward the neuronal phenotype whereas overexpression of the higher molecular weight isoforms resulted in a stabilization of the endocrine phenotype (10Grothe C. Meisinger C. Holzschuh J. Wewetzer K. Cattini P. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 1900; 57: 97-105Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Thus, the family of FGF-2 growth factors demonstrate isoform-specific functions that differ depending on the cell type studied. Further control over the effect of the FGF-2 forms is provided by the extracelluar environment which regulates the ratio of their synthesis (11Vagner S. Touriol C. Galy B. Audigier S. Gensac M.C. Amalric F. Bayard F. Prats H. Prats A.C. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1391-1402Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). In a recently published article (12Piotrowicz R.S. Martin J.L. Dillmann W.H. Levin E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7042-7047Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), we demonstrated that endothelial cells could be stimulated to secrete hmwFGF-2 in a regulated manner to levels capable of affecting cell behavior in an autocrine and paracrine fashion. The effects were 2-fold: stimulation of cell proliferation and inhibition of migration. The increase in proliferation was comparable to that promoted by an equal amount of 18-kDa FGF-2, indicating that the stimulation was independent of the additional amino-terminal peptide. On the other hand, the effect on migration was opposite to that of 18-kDa FGF-2. Although 18-kDa FGF-2 promotes cell motility, the hmwFGF-2 forms inhibited migration of endothelial cells by 50% and mammary carcinoma MCF-7 cells by greater than 70% even in the presence of unrelated mitogens that promote cell migration such as VEGF and IGF-1. Thus, we showed that, in addition to cellular effects promoted by hmwFGF-2 transported into the nucleus, these forms could also dramatically alter cell function from outside the cells. Among the various intracellular signaling pathways that are employed by peptide growth hormones to transmit signals into the nucleus is one that involves the activation of the ER. Although intuitively contrary to the characterization of these receptors as steroid hormone receptors, it has been shown repeatedly that they can be activated in a ligand independent manner. Several peptide growth hormones including EGF and IGF-1 activate the receptor in a variety of cell types andin vivo (13Aronica S.M. Katzenellenbogen B.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 743-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar, 14Katzenellenbogen B.S. Biol. Reprod. 1996; 54: 287-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar, 15Hafner F.

Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1994; 48: 481-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). In this study, we demonstrate that the ER mediates the inhibition of migration by 24-kDa FGF-2 in both endothelial cells and MCF-7 cells and that these forms of the growth factor can activate the ER leading to the transactivation of a reporter gene. In addition, we show that the mechanism by which 24-kDa FGF-2 activates the ER is different from that of other peptide growth hormones. This is the first report of an isoform-specific function of a growth factor being linked to an alternate intracellular signaling pathway. To generate pure recombinant 24-kDa FGF-2, full-length 24-kDa FGF-2 cDNA (obtained from Dr. M. Stachowiak, State University of New York, Buffalo, NY) was inserted in frame into a pPIC9K yeast expression vector (Invitrogen) between theSna BI and Avr II restriction sites of the pPIC9K vector directly downstream of the DNA encoding the X-factor secretion signal region. The His4 mutant of P. pastoris GS 115, the methanol utilization-positive phonetype (Mut+), was transformed by electroporation with the pPIC9K construct vector linearized withSac I. The His+ yeast transformants were grown on MD plates, and those carrying the kanT gene further selected for multiple integrated copies by replating on plates containing 4.0 mg/ml G418 antibiotic. The multicopy transformant was grown in 50 ml of BMGY medium with glycerol as the sole carbon source until the cultures reached an A 600 = 2–6 (∼16–18 h). The cells were collected by centrifugation at 1500–3000 × g for 5 min at room temperature and the cell pellet resuspended in BMMY medium to induce expression. The cells were grown for 4 days, and 100% methanol was added every 24 h to a final concentration of 2% to maintain protein expression. The medium was cleared of the yeast by filtration and mixed with 5 ml of heparin- Sepharose for 2 h at 4 °C. The gel was washed with 50 ml of buffer A (20 mmTris- HC1, pH 7.4, 5 mm EDTA, 2 mm EGTA) and then with buffer A containing 0.5 m NaCl. The recombinant 24-kDa basic fibroblast growth factor was eluted with buffer A containing 3 m NaCl. The eluate was dialyzed against 4 liters of 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 145 mm NaCl. Protein purity was assessed by 10% SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining and Western blot analysis using antibodies generated against a 12-amino acid peptide found within the amino-terminal domain of 24-kDa FGF-2 (17Piotrowicz R.S. Maher P.A. Levin E.G. J. Cell. Physiol. 1999; 178: 144-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). 125I-18-kDa FGF-2 (10 μCi/ml; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was added to the cells cultured in 60-mm dishes for 2 h at 4 °C. Cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and disuccinimidyl suberate (0.37 mg/ml; Pierce) added for 15 min at room temperature. The reaction was stopped with 0.2 m ethanolamine; after rinsing in phosphate-buffered saline, the cells were solubilized with 1% Triton X-100 in 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation and the supernatant used for immunoprecipitation. For immunoprecipitation of FGFR1–4, 200 μg of each cell lysate was incubated with 2 μg of the polyclonal antibodies against FGFR1–4 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) overnight at 4 °C, and immune complexes were collected on protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Complexes were washed twice in a buffer containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 10% glycerol, then once in phosphate-buffered saline. Bound proteins were eluted by boiling in 2× Laemmli sample buffer, separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE), and placed on film (Kodak BioMax). Cells were washed twice in Dulbeco's phosphate-buffered saline and then lysed with 0.5% Triton X-100 in 10 mm imidazole, pH 7.15, 40 mm KCl, 10 mm EGTA, 1 mm phenylymethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mm benzamidine, and 100 μg/ml leupeptin. The lysates were spun for 2 min at 14,000 × g to pellet cell debris and then subjected to the bicinchoninic acid protein assay (Pierce). The Triton X-100-insoluble material remaining on the flask, containing the cell nuclei, was washed twice with the lysis buffer and then solubilized in SDS-PAGE reducing sample buffer (50 mmTris, pH 6.8, 5% β-mercaptoethanol, 2% SDS, and 10% glycerol). Samples representing equivalent amounts of each fraction were subjected to electrophoresis on 12% polyacrylamide gels. Upon completion of electrophoresis, proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, blocked for 1 h at room temperature in 5% nonfat milk in 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 145 mm NaCl (Tris-buffered saline) with 0.05% Tween 20 and then incubated with dilutions of primary antibodies in Tris-buffered saline with Tween 20 containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin. Antibodies used in this study were anti-18-kDa FGF-2 monoclonal antibody (Sigma), anti-human ER-α monoclonal antibody (Neomarkers), anti-smooth muscle cell actin monoclonal antibody (Sigma), and anti-FGFR1 monoclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Bound antibody was detected using donkey anti-mouse or rabbit IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Jackson Laboratories) and the ECL chemiluminescence reagent. The stained immunoblots were placed against x-ray film (BioMax MR, Kodak) to generate chemiluminographs. All cells were maintained at 37 °C under 5% CO2 in humidified incubators and subcultured to cell densities of one third to one sixth that of confluent cultures. MCF-7 cells were maintained in phenol red-free minimal essential media supplemented with 1 mmsodium pyruvate, 10% fetal calf serum, and 10 μg/ml insulin. For the generation of estrogen receptor-negative populations, the cells were subcultured in steroid-deficient medium (SDM) prepared with phenol red-free minimal essential medium and 10% dextran/charcoal-stripped fetal calf serum. These MCF-7 cells were cultured in SDM for at least 6 months prior to use. The NIH3T3 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 1 mm each penicillin and streptomycin and 10% calf serum. Bovine aortic endothelial cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 25 mm HEPES and 4.0 g/liter glucose supplemented with 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 1 mm nonessential amino acids, 1 mm penicillin/streptomycin, and 10% fetal calf sera. Endothelial or MCF-7 cells were harvested with trypsin, counted, centrifuged, and resuspended at 1 × 105 cells in 0.5 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 0.5% bovine serum albumin. Cells were added to the upper well of a Boyden chamber containing an 8.0-μm pore size polycarbonate membrane separating the two chambers of a 6.5-mm Transwell (Costar). The upper wells were placed into lower wells containing 0.75 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/0.5% bovine serum albumin to which 10 ng/ml IGF-1(Sigma) or 10 ng/ml VEGF (Sigma) was added as a chemoattractant. Both chambers contained the 24-kDa FGF-2 at the appropriate concentrations. After 4–6 h of incubation at 37 °C in 5% CO2, nonmigratory cells on the upper membrane surface were removed with a cotton swab, and the cells that traversed and spread on the lower surface of the filter were fixed and stained with Diff-Quik (Dade-Behring). The filter was mounted on a glass slide, and four phase-contrast photomicrographs/membrane were taken (magnification, ×100). The number of cells per field was counted from contact sheets and the results compared with control chambers that had no 24-kDa FGF-2 added. To measure growth rates, MCF-7 cells (6 × 103) were plated in growth medium for 48 h, the medium changed to assay medium containing phenol red-free modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 1 mm sodium pyruvate and 0.3% lactalbumin hydrolysate plus or minus growth factors, and the cultures were allowed to incubate another 24 h. Two hours prior to the termination of the experiment, [3H]thymidine was added. The cultures were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and then ice cold methanol (2×), 5% trichloroacetic acid was added two times for 10 min each and discarded, and the DNA extracted with 0.3 nNaOH. The number of counts/min were determined on a liquid scintillation counter. MCF-7 cells or NIH3T3 cells were plated for transfection at a density of 1 × 105cells/well in a six-well tissue culture dish for 24 h. ER-positive MCF-7 cells were transfected with 2 μg of pVitEREluc, a reporter construct containing three copies of the Xenopus laevis vitellogenin estrogen regulatory element proximal to the thymidine kinase promoter driving expression of the luciferase cDNA (provided by Dr. C. Glass, University of California, San Diego, CA). NIH 3T3 cells were cotransfected with 2 μg of the reporter plasmid and 3 μg of pSG5 plasmid containing the full-length wild type cDNA for the human ER (pSG5hER, HEGO) or one of two truncated forms of the ER (HE15 containing amino acids 1–282 of the ER or HEG19 containing amino acids 178–595) provided by Dr. P. Chambon (Unite 84 de Biologie Moleculaire et de Genetique de I'NSERM, Strasbourg Cedex, France) (18Metzger D. Ali S. Bornert J.M. Chambon P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9535-9542Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). A mutant of the estrogen receptor in which serine 118 was changed to alanine was generated by the method of Kunkel (19Kunkel T.A. Roberts J.D. Zakour R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 367-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (4540) Google Scholar), and the mutation was confirmed by sequencing. The FGFR1 expression plasmid was constructed by cloning the entire coding sequence of the three Ig-like domain form of human FGFR1 into pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen). The dominant negative mutant lacking the tyrosine kinase domain was constructed by truncating the full-length receptor at the Kpn I site (between Gly-402 and Thr-403) in the juxtamembrane domain. The DNA was mixed with LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) in 1.8 ml of Opti-MEM I (Life Technologies, Inc.), allowed to sit for 45 min at room temperature, and the mixture was added to the cells that had been washed twice with Opti-MEM I. Transfection was allowed to occur for 5.5 h at 37 °C. The transfected cells were cultured for 24 h in their respective growth medium and the vehicle or agonists added at concentrations described under “Results” for another 24 h. When applicable, ICI 182,780 (Zeneca Pharmaceuticals) or the MAPKK inhibitor PD98059 was added 30 min prior to the addition of agonist. The cells were lysed with 0.1 m potassium phosphate, pH 7.8, 0.2% Triton X-100, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and the insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 10,000 ×g. ER transactivation ability was determined by measuring luciferase activity (20Karas R.H. Gauer E.A. Bieber H.E. Baur W.E. Mendelsohn M.E. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 2851-2861Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). A requirement for the presence of ER in 24-kDa FGF-2-mediated inhibition of migration was tested in MCF-7 and endothelial cells by depleting the receptor content and testing the effect on 24-kDa FGF-2-mediated migration. To reduce the level of the ER in endothelial cells, cultures were maintained in the presence of 500 nm ICI 182,780 which promotes changes in ER conformation which target the receptor for degradation (21McClelland R.A. Gee J.M. Francis A.B. Robertson J.F. Blamey R.W. Wakeling A.E. Nicholson R.I. Eur. J. Cancer. 1900; 32A: 413-416Google Scholar). Immunoblot analysis for ER content demonstrates the reduction in the level of both the cytosolic (cyt) and nuclear (nuc) ER of the ICI-treated cells (Fig.1 A). ICI-treatment reduced the amount of the 67-kDa ER by greater than 70%, in the cytoplasm and to undetectable levels in the nucleus as compared with parallel cultures of the same cells cultured in the absence of the anti-estrogen. Equivalent loading of cellular material was demonstrated by reprobing the blot with an anti-β actin peptide antibody. The loss of the ER had no significant effect on the base rate of endothelial cell migration (1.0 versus 0.86 ± 0.16, ER-positiveversus ER-negative) nor VEGF-induced enhanced migration (1.8 ± 0.2 versus 2.0 ± 0.2, ER-positiveversus ER-negative), indicating that basal motility and chemokinetic stimulation through the VEGF receptor were not impeded by the loss of the ER (Fig. 1 B). However, the reduction in ER levels resulted in the loss of the inhibitory response to 24-kDa FGF-2. The migration rate of receptor positive endothelial cells was reduced to 48 ± 8% of control values but declined only 10% to 90 ± 16% with ER-negative cells. The same was true in the presence of VEGF. The migration rate was reduced dramatically by 24-kDa FGF-2 in VEGF-treated ER-positive cells (to 40 ± 12% of ER-positive control cells), while the ER-negative cells showed no such decline. Further evidence for the involvement of the ER in the inhibition of migration in endothelial cells was obtained with short term exposure of the cells to 10 nm ICI 182,780, which results in the inactivation of ER function without the loss of ER antigen (21McClelland R.A. Gee J.M. Francis A.B. Robertson J.F. Blamey R.W. Wakeling A.E. Nicholson R.I. Eur. J. Cancer. 1900; 32A: 413-416Google Scholar). Simultaneous exposure of endothelial cells to ICI and 24-kDa FGF-2 resulted in a loss of the inhibitory potential of the 24-kDa FGF-2; motility was inhibited only 25% in cultures treated with ICIversus a 60% decline of migration in its absence (data not shown). Thus, ER function as well as ER protein is required for the inhibition of migration by the 24-kDa FGF-2. Depletion of the ER had the same effect on 24-kDa FGF-2-mediated inhibition of MCF-7 migration (Fig. 1, C and D). MCF-7 cells were cultured and maintained in SDM, which results in a nonclonal population of cells that no longer exhibit a mitogenic response to β-estradiol (12Piotrowicz R.S. Martin J.L. Dillmann W.H. Levin E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7042-7047Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). This lack of estrogen responsiveness is accompanied by a decrease in ER levels as assessed by immunoblot analysis (Fig. 1 C). Cytoplasmic ER was undetectable, while nuclear ER levels were substantially reduced. 24-kDa FGF-2 inhibited the migration of these ER-positive cells by 77 ± 18%, while in ER-negative cells the migration rates actually increased to 1.3 ± 0.22 times those of control, ER-positive cells (Fig.1 D). Reestablishing the 24-kDa FGF-2 inhibition of migration in ER-negative MCF-7 cells could be achieved by re-introducing the estrogen receptor to its normal levels. MCF-7 cells propagated in SDM (ER-negative; Fig.2 A, lane 2) were placed in serum-free Opti-MEM I for 4 h and then returned to SDM for 24 h. This short term exposure to Opti-MEMI resulted in the appearance of endogenous ER at levels approximating those of the MCF-7 cells retained in normal medium (Fig.2 A, compare lanes 1 and 3). Fig. 2 B shows that the migration rate of the cells remaining in SDM (corresponding to lane 2, panel A) is not affected by 24-kDa FGF-2 but replicate cultures stimulated to produce the ER (lane 3, panel A) only migrated 37.1 ± 10.7% as fast as the control cells. Although 24-kDa FGF-2 inhibits the migration of MCF-7 cells, it acts as a stimulus for cell proliferation equally as well as 18-kDa FGF-2 (17Piotrowicz R.S. Maher P.A. Levin E.G. J. Cell. Physiol. 1999; 178: 144-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Therefore, the effect of ER-depletion on the growth promoting activities of 24-kDa FGF-2 was examined using MCF-7 cells cultured in SDM or regular medium (Fig. 2 C). Cells were incubated with 24-kDa FGF-2 or 18-kDa FGF-2 and the rate of proliferation determined by thymidine incorporation studies. No change in the rate of cell proliferation was observed in either case regardless of the presence or absence of the ER (3.7 ± 0.3versus 3.3 ± 0.2, 18-kDa FGF-2; 3.4 ± 0.3versus 3.7 ± 0.4, 24-kDa FGF-2). Thus, the involvement of the ER in 24-kDa FGF-2 function is specific to the inhibition of migration and is not relevant to its effect on cell division. To assess the effect of 24-kDa FGF-2 on ER activity, we measured the ability of the growth factor to modulate the transcriptional activity of ER in transient transfection assays. 3T3 cells were cotransfected with a plasmid containing a triple estrogen regulatory element (ERE) proximal to the thymidine kinase promoter driving luciferase reporter gene expression and a plasmid containing the cDNA for the full-length human ER-α (22Ali S. Metzger D. Bornert J.M. Chambon P. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1153-1160Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). Fig. 3 A shows the low level of endogenous ER in the 3T3 cells and the increase in ER levels 24 h after transfection of the ER cDNA. Treatment with estradiol for 24 h had no effect on the intracellular content of the recombinant ER (Fig. 3 B). Treatment of these cells with 10 nm estradiol increased the luciferase activity in the cell extracts 3.6 ± 0.1-fold. Dose-dependent increases in luciferase activity also were observed with increasing doses of 24-kDa FGF-2 from 5 to 20 ng/ml. As the concentration of the growth factor was raised, there was a corresponding increase in luciferase activity up to 2.5 times control levels. Higher doses (30 ng/ml) had no additional effect. When the cells were transfected with the reporter plasmid only (no ER expression), no increase in luciferase activity was observed, even at 20 ng/ml, demonstrating that the ER was necessary for the stimulation of luciferase gene transcription. In contrast to the higher molecular weight FGF-2, 18-kDa FGF-2 at 20 ng/ml concentration had little effect on luciferase activity, establishing the specificity of ER activation for the higher molecular weight forms of FGF-2. Mammalian cell-derived recombinant hmwFGF-2 produced in COS cells (17Piotrowicz R.S. Maher P.A. Levin E.G. J. Cell. Physiol. 1999; 178: 144-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) gave identical results (data not shown). The ability of 24-kDa FGF-2 to activate the ER also was tested in MCF-7 cells using the natural endogenous ER and the luciferase reporter construct. Cells were transfected with the reporter construct only and treated with estradiol or 24-kDa FGF-2. Treatment with 10 nm estradiol induced an increase in luciferase activity to 2.6 ± 0.4 times control (Fig. 3 C). Addition of 24-kDa FGF-2 created a dose-dependent increase in luciferase activity to 2.3 ± 0.3 times control at 10 ng/ml. Further evidence for ER-dependent 24-kDa FGF-2 activation of luciferase expression was acquired with the pure anti-estrogen ICI 182,780 (Fig.3 D). This anti-estrogen inhibited the level of luciferase activity achieved with 10 ng/ml 24-kDa FGF-2 in a dose-dependent manner. Thus, consistent results were observed in 3T3 cells expressing an exogenous source of ER and in MCF-7 cells using the endogenous receptor. 18-kDa FGF-2 binds to and activates four different high affinity tyrosine kinase receptors, FGFR1/flg to FGFR4, although not all are found in a single cell type (23Johnson D.E.

To determine which of the four receptors were present in the MCF-7 cells, aortic endothelial cells, and 3T3 cells employed in these studies, cells extracts were analyzed by cross-linking 125I-18-kDa FGF-2 to the cells and performing immunoprecipitation with antibodies against each of the four receptors (Fig. 4 A). FGFR1 was the only receptor detected in each cell type and was the only one present in the 3T3 and endothelial cells. The doublet observed in 3T3 cells represents the two and three IG-like domain isoforms of FGFR1 (data not shown). The possibility that FGFR1 mediates the activation of the E"

We have recently converted the hTSH heterodimer to a biologically active single chain (hTSHβ·CTPα) by fusing the common α-subunit to the C-terminal end of thehTSH β-subunit in the presence of a ∼30-amino acid peptide from hCGβ ( CTP ) as a linker. The hTSHβ·CTPα single chain was used to investigate the role of theN-linked oligosaccharides of α- and β-subunits in the secretion and function of hTSH. Using overlapping PCR mutagenesis, two deglycosylated variants were prepared: one lacking both oligosaccharide chains on the α-subunit (hTSHβ·CTPα1+2) and the other lacking the oligosaccharide chain on the β-subunit (hTSHβ·CTPα(deg)). The single chain variants were expressed in CHO cells and were secreted into the medium. hTSH variants lacking the oligosaccharide chains were less potent than hTSHβ·CTPα wild-type with respect to cAMP formation and thyroid hormone secretion in cultured human thyroid follicles. Both deglycosylated variants competed with hTSH in a dose-dependent manner. The hTSHβ·CTPα1+2variant blocked cAMP formation and thyroid hormone secretion stimulated by hTSH as well as by the antibody, thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulins, responsible for the most common cause of hyperthyroidism, Graves disease.

These are heterodimers composed of two noncovalent-linked subunits, a common α-subunit and a hormone-specific β-subunit (1Pierce J. Parsons T.F. Annu. Rev.

John Wiley and Sons, NY1985: 147-183Google Scholar). Assembly of glycoprotein subunits is vital to the function of these hormones. The α- and β-subunits contain one (TSHβ and LHβ) or two (α, FSHβ, and hCGβ) asparagine-linked (N-linked) oligosaccharides (1Pierce J. Parsons T.F. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1981; 50: 465-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (1905) Google Scholar, 2Wallis M. Howell S.L. Taylor K.W. The Biochemistry of the Polypeptide Hormones. John Wiley and Sons, NY1985: 147-183Google Scholar). These residues have been shown to play a role in determining the biological activity of glycoprotein hormones, including the maintenance of intracellular stability, assembly, secretion, signal transduction, and modulation of plasma half-life (1Pierce J. Parsons T.F. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1981; 50: 465-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (1905) Google Scholar, 3Sairam M.R. Li C.H. Hormonal Proteins and Peptides. Academic Press, NY1883: 1-79Google Scholar). Deglycosylation of glycoprotein hormones have been utilized using chemical or enzymatic treatments, but these however cannot discriminate between individual sites, are nonspecific, and provide only completely deglycosylated hormones. Site-directed mutagenesis has become an important tool for studying the structure and function of glycoprotein hormones. However, mutations in either α- or β-subunits can alter the folding and ultimately inhibit subunit assembly and secretion of the hormone (4Matzuk M.M. Boime I. J.

To overcome these limitations, the genes encoding the common α-subunit and either the hCG β-, FSH β-, orTSH β-subunits have been genetically fused. The resulting polypeptide chains were efficiently secreted and were biologically active (7Sugahara T. Pixley M.R. Minami S. Perlas E. Ben-Menahem D. Hsueh A.J.W. Boime I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

These studies presumed that addition of the human CGβ C-terminal peptide (CTP) as a linker sequence between the subunits would be required for flexibility, hydrophilicity, stability, and successful expression of the single chain forms. The CTP contains several proline and serine residues and thus lacks significant secondary structure. This may permit the appropriate interactions between the subunits. In addition, previous studies showed that ligation of the CTP to hFSHβ (13Fares F.A. Suganuma N. Nishimori K. LaPolt P.S. Hsueh A.J.W. Boime I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 54-63Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) did not significantly affect assembly or in vitro biological activity, but was important for the in vivo potency of the chimeras. Assembly of the hTSH β- and α-subunits is the rate-limiting step in the production of the functional heterodimer (16Szkudlinski M.W. Grossman M. Weintraub B.D. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 1996; 7: 277-286Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Therefore, studying the structure and function of hTSH using site-directed mutagenesis may affect assembly of the subunits and production of functional hormone. Thus, converting hTSH to a single chain form could increase the biological half-life and expand the range of TSH structure-function studies. In the present study, we used site-directed mutagenesis to study the role of theN-linked carbohydrates of the α- and/or β-subunits of the hTSH single peptide chain containing the CTP as a linker between the subunits. The in vitro bioactivity of recombinant hTSH and its derivatives were assayed by cAMP formation and triiodothyronine (T3) secretion in a homologous serum-free culture system of human thyroid follicles (17Kraiem Z. Sadeh O. Yosef M. J. Endocrinol. 1991; 131: 499-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 18Fares F.A. Gruener N. Kraiem Z.

However, N-linked oligosaccharides are critical for biological activity. Moreover, the deglycosylated variant, hTSHβ·CTPα1+2, inhibited the activity of hTSH and thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulins (TSI), which may have clinical implications regarding the treatment of hyperthyroidism. Enzymes used in the construction of DNA vectors and constructs were purchased from New England BioLabs (Beverly, MA). Oligonucleotides used for chimeric construction were purchased from Genemed Biotechnology (San Francisco, CA). Cell culture media and reagents were obtained from Biological Industries (Beit hemeek, Israel). G418 was obtained from Sigma. Rabbit antiserum against hTSH dimer was purchased from Fitzgerald (Concord, MA). [35S]Cysteine/methionine mix was purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech (Buckinghamshire, UK). hTSH was a gift from the National Hormone and Pituitary Distribution Program, NIDDKD, National Institutes of Health, and hTSI (MRC Research standard B, 65/122) a gift from the National Institute for Biological Standards and Control, London, UK. The hTSH single chains were constructed using overlapping PCR mutagenesis, as described previously (7Sugahara T. Pixley M.R. Minami S. Perlas E. Ben-Menahem D. Hsueh A.J.W. Boime I. Proc. Natl. Acad.

For construction of the hTSHβ·CTPα1+2 single peptide chain, which was deglycosylated only on the α-subunit, the vectorspm 2 hTSHβ·CTPα and pm 2α1+2 were used as templates for PCR. The vectors,pm 2 hTSHβ·CTPα and pm 2α1+2, were prepared in our laboratory as previously described (4Matzuk M.M. Boime I. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 1049-1059Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 11Fares F.A. Yamabe S. Ben-Menahem D. Pixley M. Hsueh A.J.W. Boime I. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 2459-2464Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The following oligonucleotides were used for the chimeric construction: primer 1, 5′-GTGGGATCAGGGGGATCCTAGATTTCTGAGTTA-3′; primer 2, 5′-CACATCAGGAGCTTGTGGGAGGATCGG-3′; primer 3, 5′-ATCCTCCCACAAGCTCCTCATGTGCAG-3′; and primer 4, 5′-TGAGTCGACATGATAATTCAGTGATTGAAT-3′.pM 2 TSHβ·CTPα was a template for primers 1 and 2 (Fig.1 A). Primer 1 contained theTSHβ 5′-end sequence, which includes a newly formedBam HI site, and primer 2 contained the first four codons of the α-subunit and a stretch of the 3′-end of CTP sequence. Therefore, the newly synthesized fragment contained the entireTSHβ·CTP coding sequence and a part of the α sequence. pm 2α1+2was used as a template for primers 3 and 4 to generate a product containing the 3′-end of CTP and the α1+2fragment. Primer 3 contained the sequence corresponding to the last four C-terminal codons of CTP and the first five codons of the α-subunit, and primer 4 contained some of the flanking sequence of the α exon 4 that also included a newly created Sal I site. These fragments were used as overlapping templates to synthesize the single hTSHβ·CTPα1+2 gene using primers 1 and 4 (Fig. 1 A). To construct the deglycosylated hTSHβ·CTPα single chain on α- and β-subunits (hTSHβ·CTPα(deg)), mutant primers 5 and 6 (primer 5, 5′-CAGATGGTGGTGTCGATGGTTAGG-3′ and primer 6, 5′-CCTAACCATCGACACCACCATCTG-3′) were synthesized for mutagenesis of asparagine (Asn) in position 23 of the β sequence to aspartic acid (Asp). The 5′-AAC-3′ triplet coding sequence for Asn was converted to the 5′-GAC-3′ coding sequence for Asp. pM 2 TSHβ·CTPα1+2was used as template DNA, and three PCR reactions were performed for generating the TSHβ·CTPα(deg) coding sequence. The first reaction included primers 1 and 5, the second reaction included primers 6 and 4, and the final reaction included primers 1 and 4, which resulted in the former fragments containing the mutation in position 23 of the β-subunit (Fig.1 A). The eukaryotic expression vectorpm 2·HA is an expression vector that contains the ampicillin (AmpR) and the neomycin (NeoR) resistance genes and a strong promoter of the HaMuSV virus, LTR (25DeFeo D.

The Bam HI/Sal I fragments containing theTSHβ·CTPα1+2 orTSHβ·CTPα(deg) chimeric genes were inserted at the Bam HI/Sal I cloning site ofpm 2·HA and used for transfection. Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells (wild-type and/or ldlD), were transfected withpm 2 hTSHβ·CTPα,pm 2 hTSHβ·CTPα1+2, orpm 2 hTSHβ·CTPα(deg) vectors, according to the calcium phosphate precipitation method (4Matzuk M.M. Boime I. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 1049-1059Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Cells were selected for insertion of the plasmid DNA by growth in culture medium containing 0.25 mg/ml of the neomycin analog, G418. Transfected colonies resistant to G418 were harvested and screened for the expression of hTSH variants by metabolic labeling of the cells and immunoprecipitation. CHO cells were maintained in Medium 1 (Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with penicillin (100 units/ml), streptomycin (100 mg/ml), and glutamine (2 mm) containing 5% fetal calf serum), at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator. Transfected clones were maintained in the above culture medium supplemented with 0.25 mg/ml active G418 (Medium II). For hormone collection, cells secreting hTSH variants were plated and grown to confluency in T-75 flasks. Cells were washed twice with serum-free medium and 12 ml of Medium III (Medium I without fetal calf serum) were added. Medium was collected every 24 h, clarified by centrifugation, and concentrated using centriprep concentrators (Amicon, Corp., Danvers, MA). Concentrations of hTSH variants were determined by hTSH immunoradiometric assay and a double antibody radioimmunoassay (Diagnostic Products Corp., Los Angeles, CA). In addition, medium from nontransfected CHO cells was collected as described above and used as control. On day 0, cells were plated into 12-well dishes (350,000 cells/well) in 1 ml of Medium I. For continuous labeling experiments, cells were washed twice with cysteine/methionine-free Medium IV (Medium I supplemented with 5% dialyzed calf serum) and labeled for 5 h in 1 ml of cysteine/methionine-free Medium IV containing 50 μCi/ml [35S]cysteine/methionine mix. For pulse chase experiments, the cells were washed twice and preincubated for 1.5 h with cysteine-free Medium IV, followed by a 20-min pulse-labeling in cysteine/methionine-free Medium IV containing 100 μCi/ml [35S]cysteine/methionine. Pulse-chase experiments using ldlD cells were performed in the presence or absence of 10 μm galactose or 100 μm N-acetyl galactosamine. The labeled cells were then washed twice with Medium IV containing 1 mm unlabeled cysteine/methionine and incubated in this chase medium for the indicated time. Media and cell lysates were prepared, immunoprecipitated using monoclonal antisera against the α-subunit and resolved on 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gels as described previously (27Matzuk M.M. Krieger M. Corless C.L. Boime I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 6354-6358Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Cells were plated into 12-well dishes in 1 ml of Medium I. On the second day, medium was changed with medium I containing 2 μg/ml tunicamycin. Cells were incubated at 37 °C for 1.5 h. At the end of the incubation time, the medium was exchanged with Medium II containing 2 μg/ml tunicamycin and 50 μCi/ml of [35S]cysteine/methionine mix. Further analysis proceeded with metabolic labeling as described above. The bioactivity of hTSH variants were determined by measuring their ability to stimulate cAMP formation and T3 secretion from cultured human thyroid follicles as described previously (17Kraiem Z. Sadeh O. Yosef M. J. Endocrinol. 1991; 131: 499-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 18Fares F.A. Gruener N. Kraiem Z. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 555-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Essentially, human thyroid cells were prepared from colloid tissue obtained at thyroidectomy from patients with benign nodules. 200 × 103 plated onto 24-well microtiter plates and incubated with 0.5 ml of serum-free medium (DCCM-1, which contains insulin (1 μg/ml), and antibiotics), in the presence or absence of the hTSH variants and cultured for 7 days at 37 °C, in an atmosphere of 5% CO2 in a water-saturated incubator. For T3 measurements, potassium iodide (0.1 μm) was added to the medium at the start of the culture period. For cAMP measurements, 1-methyl-3-isobutylxanthine (0.5 mm), which inhibits cAMP degradation, was added to the medium. At the end of the culture period, the cAMP and T3secreted into the medium (concentrations remaining in the cells were negligible) were measured by radioimmunoassay as described previously (17Kraiem Z. Sadeh O. Yosef M. J. Endocrinol. 1991; 131: 499-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Each experiment was repeated at least three times, and results are presented as the mean ± S.E. of at least three replicate determinations. Statistical analysis of the data was performed using Student's t test and analysis of variance. p < 0.05 was considered significant. Oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis was chosen to examine the functional importance of N-linked oligosaccharides in hTSH single chain (hTSHβ·CTPα) bioactivity. The hTSHβ·CTPα contains three N-linked glycosylation sites: two on the α- and one on the β-subunit (Fig. 1 B). Mutagenesis of the Asn in the Asn-X-Thr/Ser recognition sequence for Asn-linked glycosylation is sufficient to prevent transfer of the carbohydrate to the protein (4Matzuk M.M. Boime I. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 1049-1059Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). The coding sequence of Asn (5′-AAC-3′) at positions 52 and 78 of the α-subunit was converted to the coding sequence for Asp (5′-GAC-3′). This variant was deglycosylated only on the α-subunit (pM 2 hTSHβ·CTPα1+2). To construct deglycosylated variants on the α- and β-subunits (hTSHβ·CTPα(deg)), the coding sequence for Asn (5′-AAC-3′) on the β-subunit of the hTSHβ·CTPα1+2 variant was converted to the coding sequence for Asp (5′-GAC-3′) (Fig.1 B). The coding sequence of hTSHβ·CTPα variants was sequenced to verify the mutations and the absence of other sequence alterations. Stable clonal cell lines expressing hTSHβ·CTPα, hTSHβ·CTPα1+2, and hTSHβ·CTPα(deg) were selected. Cells were labeled in the presence of [35S]methionine/cysteine mix for 7 h, media and lysates were immunoprecipitated with polyclonal human anti-α antiserum, and the proteins were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Intracellular (lysate) forms of hTSHβ·CTPα wild-type and its mutants migrated faster than corresponding extracellular (medium) forms (Fig.2 A). This is because of the differences in terminal processing of the N-linked oligosaccharides and the addition of the O- linked oligosaccharides prior to secretion. The secreted mutant forms migrated faster than wild-type (19Bielinska M. Matzuk M.M. Boime I. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 17113-17118Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This is because of their lower content of oligosaccharide chains. To confirm this assumption, CHO cells were treated with tunicamycin. Because tunicamycin prevents the addition ofN-linked oligosaccharides to the protein, a difference in mobility is expected between proteins secreted from cells treated with tunicamycin compared with those untreated. The results showed that hTSHβ·CTPα and hTSHβ·CTPα1+2 variants secreted from cells treated with tunicamycin have, as expected, the same mobility as hTSHβ·CTPα(deg) secreted from treated and untreated cells (Fig. 2 B). This indicates thatN-linked oligosaccharides are present in the α- and β-subunits of hTSHβ·CTPα as well as in the β-subunit of hTSHβ·CTPα1+2 and absent in the hTSHβ·CTPα(deg) variant. The secretion kinetics of hTSH variants was determined by pulse-chase analysis and immunoprecipitation with anti-α antiserum (Fig.3). Whereas the hTSHβ·CTPα (Fig.3 A) and hTSHβ·CTPα1+2 (Fig. 3 B) were secreted efficiently with a similar t 12 of ∼2 h, the secretion rate of hTSHβ·CTPα(deg) (Fig.3 C) was significantly slower with a t 12of ∼17 h. These differences were not because of theO- linked oligosaccharides associated with the CTP, because similar results were detected using lDld cells (results not shown), which had a reversible defect in the synthesis of O- linked oligosaccharides (20Kingsley D.M. Kozarsky K.F. Hobbie L. Krieger M. Cell. 1986; 44: 749-759Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). The data thus indicate that conversion of hTSH into a single peptide chain together with CTP as a linker allows the heterodimeric-like configuration of the mutated α- and β-subunits, as shown by secretion of the protein into the medium. The biological activity of hTSH variants was examined by their ability to stimulate cAMP formation and T3 secretion from cultured human thyroid follicles. Treatment of the cells with increasing concentrations (1–100 microunits/ml) of hTSH single chain resulted in a dose-dependent increase in cAMP formation (Fig.4 A) and triidothyronine (T3) secretion (Fig. 4 B). The maximal effect on cAMP formation and T3 secretion was seen at concentrations of 50 and 5 microunits/ml, respectively. Compared with hTSHβ·CTPα, the maximal effect of hTSHβ·CTPα1+2 or hTSHβ·CTPα(deg) on cAMP formation in thyroid cells was about 8 and 23% (p < 0.001), respectively (Fig. 4 A). Similarly, the maximal effect on T3 secretion was 64% (p < 0.001) after exposure to hTSHβ·CTPα(deg) and to undetectable amounts after exposure to hTSHβ·CTPα1+2 (Fig.4 B). In competition experiments, cells were grown in the presence of submaximal concentrations of normal hTSH (50 microunits/ml) or of hTSI (0.75 milliunits/ml) and different concentrations (5–200 microunits/ml) of deglycosylated variants (Fig.5). Both deglycosylated variants competed with hTSH in a dose-dependent manner. The cAMP levels induced by submaximal doses of hTSH were decreased in the presence of 200 microunits/ml of hTSHβ·CTPα1+2 (IC50= 70 microunits/ml) or hTSHβ·CTPα(deg) (IC50 = 158 microunits/ml) by 87 and 66% (p < 0.001), respectively (Fig. 5 A). Similarly, the T3 levels induced by submaximal doses of hTSH were decreased in the presence of 200 microunits/ml of hTSHβ·CTPα1+2 (IC50= 33 microunits/ml) or hTSHβ·CTPα(deg) (IC50 = 135 microunits/ml) by 92 and 87% (p < 0.001), respectively (Fig. 5B). The cAMP formation and T3 secretion induced by submaximal doses of hTSI were decreased by 40% (p < 0.001, IC50 = 2.5 microunits/ml) (Fig. 6 A) and 55% (p < 0.001, IC50 = 42 microunits/ml, Fig.6 B) in the presence of 100 microunits/ml of hTSHβ·CTPα(deg), respectively. 200 microunits/ml of the variant hTSHβ·CTPα1+2 reduced cAMP formation by 90% (p < 0.001, IC50 = 58 microunits/ml, Fig.6 A) and completely blocked (p < 0.001, IC50 = 15 microunits/ml) the secretion of T3(Fig. 6 B) induced by submaximal doses of hTSI.Figure 6Competitive effect of hTSH variants with hTSI. Cultured thyroid follicles were incubated for 7 days at 37 °C with submaximal doses of hTSI (0.75 milliunits/ml) in the presence of different concentrations of hTSH variants. The cAMP (A) and T3 (B) concentrations in the medium were assayed by radioimmunoassay. Each point represents the mean ± S.E. of triplicate culture wells.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The present study indicates that deglycosylated variants of hTSH single chains are expressed and secreted from CHO cells. These variants are less potent than wild-type hTSH with regard to cAMP formation and T3 secretion in cultured human thyroid follicles. Moreover, hTSHβ·CTPα(deg) reduced the biological activity of hTSH or hTSI, whereas hTSHβ·CTPα1+2 significantly blocked the activity of hTSH and hTSI. The Asn-linked oligosaccharides have been implicated in several physiologic functions such as maintenance of intracellular stability, secretion, biological activity, and modulation of the plasma half-life (1Pierce J. Parsons T.F. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1981; 50: 465-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (1905) Google Scholar, 3Sairam M.R. Li C.H. Hormonal Proteins and Peptides. Academic Press, NY1883: 1-79Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis has become an effective method to study the role of individual carbohydrate chains on multiglycosylated proteins. However, site-directed mutagenesis may affect assembly of heterodimer subunits. It has been reported that mutating the hTSHβ-subunit significantly reduced TSH dimer formation (14Joshi L. Murata Y. Wondisford F.E. Szkudlinski M.W. Desai R. Weintraub B.D. Endocrinology. 1994; 136: 3839-3848Crossref Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Other studies indicate that loss of oligosaccharides from the α-subunit reduced assembly and/or stability of hCG (4Matzuk M.M. Boime I. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 1049-1059Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). To bypass the problem of dimerization of deglycosylated subunits, the subunits α and β were genetically fused in a single chain hormone. Single chains of hCG (7Sugahara T. Pixley M.R. Minami S. Perlas E. Ben-Menahem D. Hsueh A.J.W. Boime I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2041-2045Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), hFSH (8Sugahara T. Sato A. Kudo M. Ben-Menahem D.

Hsueh A.J.W. Boime I. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 2459-2464Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Grossman M. Wong R. Szkudlinski M.W. Weintraub B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21312-21316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) retained a biologically active conformation similar to that of the heterodimer (11Fares F.A. Yamabe S. Ben-Menahem D. Pixley M. Hsueh A.J.W. Boime I. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 2459-2464Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Grossman M. Wong R. Szkudlinski M.W. Weintraub B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21312-21316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Therefore, fusion of α- and β-subunits in a single chain bypasses the assembly of the subunits, which is a rate-limiting step for hormone secretion and bioactivity. It is apparent that despite the single chain structure, correct conformation of the subunits occurs, and the single chains have a normal biological activity (11Fares F.A. Yamabe S. Ben-Menahem D. Pixley M. Hsueh A.J.W. Boime I. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 2459-2464Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Grossman M. Wong R. Szkudlinski M.W. Weintraub B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21312-21316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). For studying the role of N-linked oligosaccharides on hTSH function, we used the single chain of hTSH that contains the CTP as a linker between α- and β-subunits (11Fares F.A. Yamabe S. Ben-Menahem D. Pixley M. Hsueh A.J.W. Boime I. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 2459-2464Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Previous studies indicated that fusing the CTP to the C-terminal end of hFSHβ (13Fares F.A. Suganuma N. Nishimori K. LaPolt P.S. Hsueh A.J.W. Boime I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Endocrinology. 1992; 131: 2514-2520Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), to theN-terminal of hCGα (15Furuhashi M. Shikone T. Fares F.A. Sugahara T. Hsueh A.J.W. Boime I. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 54-63Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), or to hTSHβ (22Joshi L. Murata Y. Wondisford F.E. Szkudlinski M.W. Desai R. Weintraub B.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9062-9066Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) does not affect the assembly, secretion, and signal transduction of the respective dimers compared with the wild type. In addition, it was reported that CTP and associated O- linked oligosaccharides in hCG are not important for receptor binding or in vitro signal transduction but are critical for in vivo biological response (23Matzuk M.M. Hsueh A.J.W. LaPolt P. Tsafriri A. Keene J.L. Boime I. Endocrinology. 1990; 126: 376-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Moreover, it has been shown that the secretion of the hFSH single chain increased in the presence of CTP as a linker between the subunits (8Sugahara T. Sato A. Kudo M. Ben-Menahem D. Pixley M.R. Hsueh A.J.W. Boime I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10445-10448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The fact that deglycosylated variants of hTSH are secreted efficiently from CHO and ldlD cells (ldlD cells have a reversible defect in synthesizing oligosaccharide chains, data not shown) indicates that N-linked and O- linked oligosaccharides are not vital for the secretion of the hTSH single chain. Therefore, the signal for the secretion of the hormone exists in the single chains itself. The bioactivity of the variants was examined in an in vitro system of human thyroid follicles cultured in suspension, under serum-free conditions, in which the follicular three-dimensional structure is retained (17Kraiem Z. Sadeh O. Yosef M. J. Endocrinol. 1991; 131: 499-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 18Fares F.A. Gruener N. Kraiem Z. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 555-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). This bioassay has several advantages over the current methods used for testing thyroid biological activity. First, it allows the measurement of T3 secretion, the physiologically relevant hormonal end-point response, which is very seldom measured when testing for thyroid biological activity. Second, the cells are of human origin, which is important in view of wide species variation in thyroid response to TSH agonists. The results indicated that deletion of the N-linked oligosaccharides from the single chain diminished biological activity. However, a difference in bioactivity between the variants was apparent. hTSHβ·CTPα(deg) was more potent than hTSHβ·CTPα1+2, and this may be related to the difference in conformation of the variants. The competition experiments indicated that hTSHβ·CTPα1+2 markedly blocked cAMP formation and T3 secretion induced by hTSH and hTSI. Therefore, this variant can be considered as a potential antagonist to both hTSH as well as hTSI. It is worth noting that we tested, to the best of our knowledge for the first time, not only TSH but TSI as well,i.e. the factor responsible for the most common cause of hyperthyroidism, Graves' disease, thus substantiating considerably the clinical implications of our study. Therefore, the hTSHβ·CTPα1+2 variant, behaves as a potential antagonist that may offer a novel therapeutic strategy of thyrotoxicosis because of Graves' disease and TSH-secreting pituitary adenoma. The existence of CTP as a linker between the subunits in the hTSHβ·CTPα1+2 may prevent rapid degradation in vivo and increase their half-life in the circulation. The therapeutic efficacy of this analog needs to be established in in vivo studies and clinical trials.

https://openalex.org/W2170860817,"We have collected synchrotron x-ray solution scattering data for the MoFe protein of Klebsiella pneumoniae nitrogenase and show that the molecular conformation of the protein that contains only one molybdenum per α2β2 tetramer is different from that of the protein that has full occupancy i.e. two molybdenums per molecule. This structural finding is consistent with the existence of MoFe protein molecules that contain only one FeMo cofactor site occupied and provides a rationale for the 50% loss of the specific activity of such preparations. A stable inactive transition state complex has been shown to form in the presence of MgADP and AlF 4−. Gel filtration chromatography data show that the MoFe protein lacking a full complement of the cofactor forms initially a 1:1 complex before forming a low affinity 1:2 complex. A similar behavior is found for the MoFe protein with both cofactors occupied, but the high affinity 1:2 complex is formed at a lower ratio of Fe protein/MoFe protein. The 1:1 complex, MoFe protein-Fe protein ·(ADP·AlF 4−)2, formed with MoFe protein that lacks one of the cofactors, is stable. X-ray scattering studies of this complex have enabled us to obtain its low resolution structure at ∼20-Å resolution, which confirms the gel filtration finding that only one molecule of the Fe protein binds the MoFe protein. By comparison with the low resolution structure of purified MoFe protein that contains only one molybdenum per tetramer, we deduce that the Fe protein interacts with the FeMo cofactor-binding α-subunit of the MoFe protein. This observation demonstrates that the conformation of the α-subunit or the αβ subunit pair that lacks the FeMo cofactor is altered and that the change is recognized by the Fe protein. The structure of the 1:1 complex reveals a similar change in the conformation of the Fe protein as has been observed in the low resolution scattering mask and the high resolution crystallographic study of the 1:2 complex where both cofactors are occupied and with the Fe protein bound to both subunits. This extensive conformational change observed for the Fe protein in the complexes is, however, not observed when MgATP or MgADP binds to the isolated Fe protein. Thus, the large scale conformational change of the Fe protein is associated with the complex formation of the two proteins.

The MoFe proteins have an α2β2 subunit structure in which each subunit pair binds a unique Fe8S7 cluster (P cluster) positioned at the subunit interface and the active site of the enzyme, a Fe7S9 molybdenum homocitrate cluster (FeMo cofactor), within the α-subunit (11Chan M.K. Kim J. Rees D.C. Science. 1993; 260: 792-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar). The Fe protein is a γ2 dimer that has a single [Fe4S4] cluster at the subunit interface and two nucleotide binding sites, one on each subunit (6Georgiadis M.M. Komiya H. Chakrabarti P. Woo D.

The binding of MgADP or MgATP to the isolated Fe protein results in an altered reactivity and spectroscopic properties of the Fe-S cluster, which have been well documented (see Ref. 4Burgess B.K.

Aluminum fluoride has been extensively used as a tool to examine MgATP binding by gated proteins (16Coleman D.E. Berghuis A.M. Lee E. Linder M.E. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R.

It has been proposed that the ADP-AlF 4−complex can be considered to be an analogue of E-ADP·Pi species in which AlF 4−mimics the trigonal bipyrimidal geometry of the terminal phosphate undergoing nucleophilic attack by a water molecule. More recently, Kp1 and Kp2 have been shown to form ADP-BeF 3−stabilized complexes, being putative analogues of the MgATP-bound conformation (19Clarke T.A. Yousafzai F.K. Eady R.R. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 9906-9913Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Extensive kinetic and modeling work has shown that following each electron transfer, the Fe protein and the MoFe protein complex dissociates in what is the rate-limiting reaction of nitrogenase turnover (see Ref. 4Burgess B.K. Lowe D.J. Chem. Rev. 1996; 96: 2983-3011Crossref PubMed Scopus (1478) Google Scholar). It has been demonstrated that this transient complex can be stabilized in the presence of ADP and AlF 4−as an inactive putative transition state complex. The structure of a 1:2 transition state complex, MoFe protein-[(Fe protein·ADP·AlF 4−)2]2, was recently determined at ∼20-Å resolution for K. pneumoniae nitrogenase using x-ray solution scattering (14Grossmann J.G.

Biol. 1997; 266: 642-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) and for A. vinelandii nitrogenase at 3-Å resolution by x-ray crystallography (20Schindelin H. Kisker C. Schlessman J.L. Howard J.B.

For both species, a 13° rotation of subunits of the Fe protein compared with that of the isolated protein was observed (21Grossmann J.G. Hasnain S.S. Yousafzai F.K. Smith B.E. Eady R.R. Schindelin H. Kisker C. Howard J.B. Tsuruta H. Muller J. Rees D.C. Acta Crystallogr. D. 1999; 55: 727-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), indicating that the Fe protein undergoes a substantial conformational change either on complex formation or nucleotide binding. In the complex, the conformational change undergone by the Fe protein brings the Fe4S4 cluster of the Fe protein 4 Å closer to the P cluster of the MoFe protein, to a typical electron transfer distance of ∼14 Å. It is unclear whether this change in conformation takes place in the complex or is a result of MgATP binding to the Fe protein. In the case of the Fe protein from Av, it has been suggested from a small angle x-ray scattering study that a substantial conformational change has already taken place upon MgATP binding (22Chen L. Gavini N. Tsuruta H. Eliezer D. Burgess B.K. Doniach S. Hodgson K.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3290-3294Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The hypothesis that this “priming” of the Fe protein conformation is required to allow effective docking with the MoFe protein to permit successful electron transfer (see Ref. 23Seefeldt L.C. Ryle M.J. Chan J.M. Lanzilotta W.N. Elmerich C. Kondorosi A. Newton W.E. Biological Nitrogen Fixation for the 21st Century. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, The Netherlands1998: 39-42Google Scholar for discussion) lacks firm experimental evidence and has been questioned recently. An alternative, in which MgATP binds rapidly to a complex of Fe and MoFe proteins, followed by subsequent conformational changes in the Fe protein, has been proposed (24Duyvis M.G. Wassink H. Haaker H. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 17345-17354Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Moreover, in the heterologous nitrogenase formed between the Fe protein of C. pasteurianum and the MoFe protein from A. vinelandii, MgATP is not required for complex formation (25Chan J.M. Ryle M.J. Seefeldt L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17593-17958Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 26Clarke T.A. Maritano S. Eady R.R. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 11434-11440Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). We have recently reported that the kinetics of the formation ofthe K. pneumoniae transition state complex are consistent with MoFe protein lacking one FeMoco2 center having an altered molecular conformation, which the Fe protein can recognize (15Yousafzai F.K. Eady R.R. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 635-640Crossref Scopus (3) Google Scholar). To test this proposal experimentally, we have obtained solution x-ray scattering data of Kp1 containing one or two FeMoco centers per molecule and generated their molecular shapes at ∼20-Å resolution for both forms. In addition, the 1:1 complex MoFe protein-(Fe protein·ADP·AlF 4−) was isolated using Kp1 with only one cofactor site occupied, and the molecular structure was determined from solution x-ray scattering data. The molecular structure of the isolated Fe protein in the absence and presence of nucleotide was also examined to establish the extent of conformational change in Fe protein on its own. All manipulation of the air-sensitive nitrogenase components was done under an atmosphere of nitrogen. The nitrogenase proteins Kp1 and Kp2 were purified fromK. pneumoniae to homogeneity as described previously (27Yousafzai F.K. Buck M. Smith B.E Biochem. J. 1996; 318: 111-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar,28Eady R.R. Smith B.E. Cook K.A. Postgate J.R. Biochem. J. 1972; 133: 655-675Crossref Scopus (174) Google Scholar). In the case of Kp1, this method (27Yousafzai F.K. Buck M. Smith B.E Biochem. J. 1996; 318: 111-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) resolved species containing 1.1 and 1.9 molybdenum atoms per molecule and were shown to be free of any contaminating proteins by SDS gel electrophoresis. The specific activities expressed as nmol of hydrogen evolved/min/mg of protein were as follows: Kp1(1.9 Mo), 2100; Kp1(1.1 Mo), 1100; Kp2, 1399. For data collection, Kp1 was in 25 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.5, containing 250 mm NaCl and 2 mmNa2S2O4. Kp2 was in the same buffer except at 50 mm, and in some experiments 10 mmMgCl2 and 5 mm ATP were present. After exposure to the x-ray beam and after the scattering data had been collected, samples of Kp2 were removed from the cell, and the specific activity was remeasured; typically, the recovery was 80% or higher. The 1:1 Kp1-(Kp2·ADP·AlF4−)2 complex was prepared as described previously for the 2:1 complex (15Yousafzai F.K. Eady R.R. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 635-640Crossref Scopus (3) Google Scholar), except that the Kp1 used contained 1.1 molybdenum atoms per α2β2 tetramer. The complex was separated from the excess Kp2 and reaction mixture components by anaerobic gel filtration using an Amersham Pharmacia Biotech FPLC system and a 26/60 Superdex™ 200 column equilibrated with 25 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.5, 2 mm Na2S2O4, 5 mm AlF3, and 50 mm KF. Further purification was carried out using an anion exchange Mono Q 5/5 column developed with a linear gradient of NaCl from 0.1 to 1 m in 50 mm Tris buffer, pH 7.5, containing 5 mmAlF3 and 2 mmNa2S2O4. This procedure resulted in the separation of three species, which subsequent analytical gel filtration showed to be homogeneous species with retention volumes corresponding to Kp1 and the 1:1 and 1:2 complexes. The work described in this paper utilized the purified 1:1 complex. Due to the extreme sensitivity to oxygen, all manipulations of nitrogenase proteins were conducted in an anaerobic chamber (glove box) in an atmosphere of nitrogen containing a very low concentration of oxygen (<5 ppm of O2). All samples were filtered (0.2-μm pore size) and loaded in the glove box into a brass cell (containing a Teflon ring sandwiched by two mica windows that defines the sample volume of 120 μl and a thickness of 2.5 mm). The cell was sealed with plastocene and then transferred immediately to the x-ray station. Scattering data were collected on beamline 8.2 at the Synchrotron Radiation Source (Daresbury, UK) (29Bras W. Derbyshire G.E. Ryan A.J. Mant G.R. Felton A. Lewis R.A. Hall C.J. Greaves G.N. Nucl. Instrum. Methods Phys. Res. A. 1993; A325: 587-591Crossref Scopus (169) Google Scholar) at an electron energy of 2 GeV and with beam currents between 150 and 250 mA. At the sample-to-detector distance of 3.3 m (2.5 m) and the x-ray wavelength of λ =1.54 Å, a momentum transfer interval of 0.002 (0.004) Å−1 ≤ s ≤ 0.030 (0.035) Å−1 was covered on a position-sensitive quadrant multiwire proportional counter (30Lewis R. Sumner I. Berry A. Bordas J. Gabriel A. Mant G. Parker G. Roberts K. Worgan J. Nucl. Instrum. Methods Phys. Res. A. 1988; A273: 773-777Crossref Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Values in parentheses refer to the measurements for the Fe protein only. The modulus of the momentum transfer is defined as s = (2sinΘ)/λ, where 2Θ is the scattering angle. The scattering pattern from an oriented specimen of wet rat tail collagen was used to calibrate the detector. Samples were measured at room temperature (∼20 °C) at concentrations between 0.5 and 5 mg/ml. To minimize systematic errors, each data set consisted of buffer followed by protein data collection. The experimental data were recorded in frames of 100 s allowing on-line checks for changes in the scattering profiles and corrected for background scattering (subtraction of the scattering from the camera and a cell filled with buffer), sample transmission and concentration, and positional nonlinearities of the detector. Off-line data reduction was done with the OTOKO software package (31Boulin C. Kempf R. Koch M.H.J. McLaughlin S.M. Nucl. Instrum. Methods Phys. Res. A. 1986; A249: 399-407Crossref Scopus (296) Google Scholar). Maximum particle dimensions D max, the radius of gyration R g , the distance distribution function p(r), and the extrapolated forward scattering value I(0) were evaluated with the program GNOM (32Semenyuk A.V. Svergun D.I. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1991; 24: 537-540Crossref Scopus (575) Google Scholar). The latter allows the estimation of molecular mass when calibrated against the scattering from proteins with known molecular mass (apart from fully loaded Kp1, 225 kDa, as standard for an anaerobic protein sample, nitrous oxide reductase, 134 kDa, was used). The volume V of the particle can be calculated from the Porod invariant (33Porod G. Kolloid Zeitschrift. 1951; 124: 83-114Crossref Scopus (1558) Google Scholar), including the outer part of the scattering profile. A correction factor is applied to alleviate the difficulties of the limited range of scattering data (described in Ref. 34Feigin L.A. Svergun D.I. Structure Analysis by Small-angle X-Ray and Neutron Scattering. Plenum Press, New York1987: 79-81Google Scholar). More details concerning data collection and reduction are given elsewhere (35Grossmann J.G. Crawley J.B. Strange R.W. Patel K.J. Murphy L.M. Neu M. Evans R.W. Hasnain S.S. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 279: 461-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The computation of the molecular envelopes was based on the ab initio shape determination procedure of Svergun and Stuhrmann (36Svergun D.I. Stuhrmann H.B. Acta Crystallogr. A. 1991; 47: 736-744Crossref Scopus (128) Google Scholar). If we assume that the scattering is caused by a globular, homogeneous molecule, one can define its molecular shape by the angular envelope function F(θ,ϕ) such that the particle density ρ(r) is unity inside the molecular boundary and vanishes elsewhere. F(θ,ϕ) can be expanded into a series of spherical harmonics Y lm (θ,ϕ) according to Refs.37Stuhrmann H.B. Acta Crystallogr. A. 1970; 26: 297-306Crossref Scopus (153) Google Scholar and 38Stuhrmann H.B. Z. für Phys. Chem. 1970; 72 (, 185–198): 177-184Crossref Scopus (77) Google Scholar, F(θ,ϕ)=∑l=0L∑m=−1lflmYlm(θ,ϕ)Equation 1 where f lm represents complex multipole coefficients. The determination of molecular shapes directly from the scattering profile alone in a model-independent manner exploits the information inherent in the wider angle scattering data. The resolution is determined by the maximum order of included harmonics,i.e. the highest value of L. A nonlinear equations system interrelates the f lm coefficients with coefficients of the power series describing the experimental scattering curve. A reliable computational procedure was used to evaluate the multipole coefficients by minimizing the least squares deviation (R 2) between experimental and calculated curves according to methods described by Svergun and Stuhrmann (36Svergun D.I. Stuhrmann H.B. Acta Crystallogr. A. 1991; 47: 736-744Crossref Scopus (128) Google Scholar) and Svergun et al. (39Svergun D.I. Volkov V.V. Kozin M.B. Stuhrmann H.B. Acta Crystallogr. A. 1996; 52: 419-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The shape calculation for the nitrogenase proteins has been performed with smoothed experimental curves (where the low angle part was adjusted to match the corresponding extrapolation to zero concentration). No molecular symmetry was assumed (except for the shape restoration of the isolated Fe protein as well as of the fully loaded MoFe protein; in both cases, a 2-fold symmetry is expected). The available experimental data range for the nitrogenase enzymes justifies the use of harmonics up to L = 4 (using no symmetry; i.e. 19 free parameters) and L = 5 (in the case of symmetry; i.e. 14 free parameters). To set the scene, atomic models have been fitted manually into the molecular shapes. The shape pictures were rendered and manipulated using a Silicon Graphics Indigo work station and the AVS graphics software (Advanced Visual Systems, Inc., Waltham, MA). The ribbon diagrams were produced using the molecular graphics program Insight II (Biosym/MSI). Crystallographic information was utilized to define the nature of the observed scattering features in structural terms. Scattering curves from atomic models of the fully loaded MoFe protein (10Mayer S.M. Lawson D.M. Gormal C.A. Roe S.M. Smith B.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 292: 871-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar), a modeled MoFe protein with missing FeMo cofactor, a 1:1 complex based on the A. vinelandii nitrogenase complex (20Schindelin H. Kisker C. Schlessman J.L. Howard J.B. Rees D.C. Nature. 1997; 387: 370-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar), and the Fe protein in its free state (9Schlessman J.L. Woo D. Joshua-Tor L. Howard J.B. Ress D.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 280: 669-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) were evaluated using the program CRYSOL (40Svergun D. Barberato C. Koch M.H.J. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1995; 28: 768-773Crossref Scopus (2790) Google Scholar). This method takes the solvent effect into account by surrounding the protein with a hydration shell that has a thickness of 3 Å and uniform density (as fit parameter) different from that of bulk solvent. In a previous study, the rate of formation of the transition state complex Kp1-(Kp2·ADP·AlF 4−)2was monitored by the loss of nitrogenase activity as the proteins were incubated in the presence of ADP and AlF 4−(15Yousafzai F.K. Eady R.R. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 635-640Crossref Scopus (3) Google Scholar). It was proposed that Kp1 that did not have all FeMoco and P cluster binding sites in the protein occupied had an altered conformation compared with fully loaded protein and that Kp2 reacted with these protein species at different rates to form the inhibited complex. To detect complexes formed by Kp1 preparations that are partially active due to incomplete occupancy of the FeMoco binding sites, a method was developed to monitor complex formation that was independent of activity measurements. The extent of formation of the transition state complexes was determined using gel permeation chromatography of reaction mixtures containing a range of molar ratios of Kp1 and Kp2 from 0.25 to 5 Kp2/Kp1 in the presence of MgADP and AlF 4−. Fig.1 shows the elution profiles from a gel filtration column of the protein species present in incubation mixtures leading to the formation of the transition state complex for a preparation of Kp1 containing only 1.1 molybdenum atoms per αβ dimer. At the lowest Kp2/Kp1 ratio tested, the profile is dominated by free Kp1, which has a retention volume of 10.3 ml (bottom trace in Fig. 1). At this ratio, no peak corresponding to free Kp2 is evident, but a shoulder on the elution profile of Kp1 arising from a higher molecular weight species with a retention volume of 9.8 ml has been formed. As the Kp2/Kp1 ratio was increased to 0.5 Kp2/Kp1, this species became the dominant feature, but at higher ratios it was replaced by a peak with a retention volume of 8.9 ml. A peak corresponding to free Kp2 with a retention volume of 12.35 ml was also detectable under these conditions. The Kp2 band was first evident at a ratio of 1:1 Kp2/Kp1 and continued to grow as the ratio was increased (Fig. 1). These data are consistent with the formation of two types of stable complexes by Kp1 lacking a full complement of cofactor centers, as the Kp2/Kp1 ratio is varied. We propose that initially a 1:1 complex is formed as an intermediate on its way to the 1:2 complex, which predominates at high Kp2/Kp1 ratios. The kinetic data of Yousafzai and Eady (15Yousafzai F.K. Eady R.R. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 635-640Crossref Scopus (3) Google Scholar) are consistent with Kp2 in this complex binding to the α2β2 subunit pair, which contain the metal redox centers. When similar experiments were carried out with Kp1 containing 1.9 molybdenum atoms per α2β2tetramer, a similar behavior was observed, but the formation of the 1:2 complex occurred at a lower ratio of Kp2/Kp1 (data not presented), consistent with a difference in the stability of the 2:1 complexes formed by the two species of Kp1. To isolate the 1:1 complex in sufficient quantity to allow structural studies, it was purified from the components formed in an incubation mixture containing Kp1 lacking a full complement of cofactor centers as described under “Experimental Procedures.” This procedure resulted in the separation of three species, which subsequent analytical gel filtration showed to have retention volumes corresponding to Kp1 and the 1:1 and 1:2 complexes. Fig. 2 compares the x-ray scattering patterns (with error bars) for the fully loaded Kp1 (i.e. with the full complement of the cofactor) and Kp1 with only half the cofactor centers present (from now on denoted as Kp1 12). The two scattering profiles are distinct, crossing each other at an intermediate s, suggesting that a significant structural difference exists. As shown in TableI, the geometrical parameters increase in the absence of a full metal cofactor complement, indicating an expansion of the overall conformation. The main differences in thep(r) curves (Fig. 2, inset) occur for longer distances and in the maximum of p(r), which is shifted for Kp1 12to larger distances (by approximately 5 Å) to 47 Å. To evaluate possible protein aggregation, scattering patterns have been obtained in the concentration range from 0.5 to 5 mg/ml. The concentration-dependent values for radii of gyration are revealed in Fig.3 a, highlighting the difference between the two protein samples. r itinf;g values (extrapolated to infinite dilution) differ by as much as 1.5 Å, and the R g versusconcentration curve shows very different slopes for Kp1 and Kp1 12. This may reflect a change in the electrostatic properties of the Kp1 and Kp1 12surface. The difference in scattering behavior is further illustrated in Fig. 3 b, where the ratio of the scattering curves for Kp1 and Kp1 12are plotted (upper trace). It is clear that scattering data for the two protein samples differ over much of the range, and only beyond s ≈ 0.02 Å−1, the ratio hovers around unity. As a control, the lower trace in Fig. 3 bshows the intensity ratio of scattering profiles from half-loaded Kp1 recorded at two different concentrations. It is clear that in this case the ratio is unity over almost the whole data range. Moreover, a careful analysis of I(0) did no"
