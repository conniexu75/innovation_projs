https://openalex.org/W2044586762,"Dicer is a multi-domain protein responsible for the generation of short interfering RNAs (siRNAs) from long double-stranded RNAs during RNA interference. It is also involved in the maturation of microRNAs, some of which are transcriptional regulators of developmental timing in nematodes. To assess the role of Dicer in mammals, we generated Dicerex1/2 mice with a deletion of the amino acid sequences corresponding to the first and second exons of the dicer gene via homologous recombination. We found that Dicerex1/2 homozygous embryos displayed a retarded phenotype and died between days 12.5 and 14.5 of gestation. Thus, these results show that dicerex1/2 is severely hypomorphic and that Dicer is essential for normal mouse development. Interestingly, we also found that blood vessel formation/maintenance in dicerex1/2 embryos and yolk sacs were severely compromised, suggesting a possible role for Dicer in angiogenesis. This finding is consistent with the altered expression of vegf, flt1, kdr, and tie1 in the mutant embryos. Taken together, the results of this study indicate that Dicer exerts its function on mouse embryonic angiogenesis probably through its role in the processing of microRNAs that regulate the expression levels of some critical angiogenic regulators in the cell.

When cells encounter long double-stranded RNA molecules, Dicer, a ribonuclease III type enzyme, cleaves them into small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) of 21–23 nucleotides. These siRNAs are incorporated into a multicomponent protein complex known as RISC (RNA-induced silencing complex). The antisense strand of siRNAs is believed to guide the RISC to locate its cognate mRNA molecule. As a result, the mRNAs are degraded (6Zamore P.D. Tuschl T. Sharp P.A. Bartel D.P. Cell. 2000; 101: 25-33Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Bernstein E. Caudy A.A. Hammond S.M. Hannon G.J.

As one of the critical enzymes of the RNAi pathway, Dicer was first identified from Drosophila embryo and S2 cell extracts as the initiation enzyme for RNAi (7Bernstein E. Caudy A.A. Hammond S.M. Hannon G.J. Nature. 2001; 409: 363-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (3819) Google Scholar). It is a large (∼220 kDa), multi-domain protein that consists of an amino-terminal helicase domain followed by a PAZ domain, two RNase III domains, and a C-terminal double-stranded RNA-binding domain (dsRBD). The dsRBD and RNase III domains are involved in the binding to and cleavage of long double-stranded RNAs, but the functions of other domains remain unclear (9Zhang H. Kolb F.A. Brondani V. Billy E. Filipowicz W. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5875-5885Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). Genetic and biochemical studies have established that Dicer is required for the production of siRNAs from double-stranded RNAs in Caenorhabditis elegans, Drosophila, and humans. In addition to its important role in the RNAi pathway, Dicer also plays pivotal roles in development. In C. elegans, inactivation of the dcr-1 (homolog of Drosophila Dicer) gene results in defects in the RNAi pathway as well as developmental abnormalities similar to those caused by the loss of function of let-7, a gene encoding a microRNA (miRNA) essential for the control of developmental timing in this organism (10Ketting R.F.

Ha I. Baillie D.L. Fire A. Ruvkun G. Mello C.C. Cell. 2001; 106: 23-34Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1524) Google Scholar). This finding suggests that Dicer is also responsible for processing miRNA precursors, which often form a stem-loop structure creating a double-stranded RNA molecule (12Pasquinelli A.E. Reinhart B.J. Slack F. Martindale M.Q. Kuroda M.I. Maller B. Hayward D.C. Ball E.E. Degnan B. Muller P. Spring J. Srinivasan A. Fishman M. Finnerty J. Corbo J. Levine M. Leahy P. Davidson E. Ruvkun G. Nature. 2000; 408: 86-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (1879) Google Scholar). In addition, human Dicer was shown to be responsible for the generation of mature let-7 in HeLa cells (13Hutvágner G. McLachlan J. Pasquinelli A.E. Balint É. Tuschl T. Zamore P.D. Science. 2001; 293: 834-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (2190) Google Scholar). Therefore, the function of Dicer in development may be well conserved during evolution. Currently, there is an emerging interest in miRNAs because, under normal conditions, miRNAs rather than siRNAs appear to have a major role in small RNA-mediated gene regulation. Therefore, the principle role of Dicer in vivo may be involved in the biogenesis of mRNAs (14Grosshans H. Slack F.J. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 156: 17-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Recently, ∼90 miRNAs have been identified from C. elegans, Drosophila, mouse tissues, and human cell cultures. Among these, nine are found in more than one phylum (15Lagos-Quintana M. Rauhurt R. Lendeckel W. Tuschl T. Science. 2001; 294: 853-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (3975) Google Scholar, 16Lau N.C. Lim L.P. Weinstein E.G. Bartel D.P.

Yalcin A. Meyer J. Lendeckel W. Tuschl T. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 735-739Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2779) Google Scholar). This finding suggests that miRNA-mediated post-transcriptional regulation may function in a wide variety of organisms. Furthermore, the large numbers of miRNAs as well as the source from where they have been identified also suggest that miRNAs may be involved in the regulation of multiple physiological pathways (14Grosshans H. Slack F.J. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 156: 17-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). To assess the function of Dicer in a mammalian system, we sought to generate Dicer-deficient mice via homologous recombination in embryonic stem cells. We show that dicerex1/2 embryos are growth and developmentally retarded and die between embryonic day (E) 12.5 and 14.5. Therefore, Dicer is essential for normal development. In addition, the mutant embryos and their yolk sacs are found to display defects in the blood vessel formation/maintenance, suggesting a role for Dicer in the regulation of embryonic angiogenesis via its function in the processing of miRNAs. Construction of a dicer Targeting Vector—A DNA primer corresponding to the 5′-region of the mouse dicer genomic sequence was used to screen a mouse CITB BAC library by Research Genetics (Carlsbad, CA). One positive clone (474 E 20) was identified and confirmed by colony PCR using two primers, wjy1 and wjy3, corresponding to mouse dicer cDNA sequences (wjy1, 5′-AGCATGGCAGGCCTGCAG-3′; wjy3, 5′-TGATGGGCCAGCTCTTTGG-3′). An ∼10-kb BamHI-XhoI fragment from this BAC clone was ligated into a pBluescript plasmid (Stratagene). The 1.2-kb HindIII-PmlI fragment containing exons 1 and 2 of dicer was then replaced by a neo expression cassette. Generation of dicerex1/2 Mice—The targeting construct was linearized at the XhoI site and introduced into mouse embryonic stem cell E14 via electroporation. G418-resistant colonies selected were screened for the homologous recombination by Southern blotting analysis using a 3′-flanking probe, a 5′-flanking probe, and a neo probe. Both the 3′- and 5′-probes were generated by PCR reaction off the BAC clone. The primers used for the 3′-probe were 5′-TCTTCGTCGAAACGTACAAG-3′ and 5′-TGGAAAGACCCTCATTCCAAG-3′. The primers for amplifying the 5′-probe were 5′-GTTATTACCACTAAATATCACG-3′ and 5′-CT-GCCAAGGCTTTGTTTCAC-3′. The neo probe was a 259-bp PstI fragment from a plasmid containing the neo cassette. Three of six positive clones identified were microinjected into blastocysts and implanted into pseudopregnant C57BL/6 (B6) females. Chimeric males were mated with B6 females (Harland) to yield heterozygous F1 offspring, which were then intercrossed to produce +/+, +/-, -/- offspring. Tail DNA from mice was isolated using genomic isolation kit from Lamda Biotechnology, and genotyping was carried out by PCR reaction using the primers KOF (5′-AGCCATCTCCCCAGAAGTCC-3′), which was the forward primer common for both the wild-type and the targeted allele, KOR2 (5′-CCAAAGAACGGAGCCGGTTG-3′), and KOR1 (5′-CGTGTAGGGTTCAGTCATTCGT-3′), which were designed for the amplification of the wild type and the targeted alleles, respectively. Analysis of Embryos—Detection of vaginal plugs in the morning was taken as gestation day 0.5 (E0.5). Embryos were staged and dissected from the pregnant females. Yolk sacs from different stage embryos were dissolved in a PCR lysis buffer (50 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, 0.01% gelatin, 0.45% Nonidet P-40, 0.45% Tween, and 100 μg/ml proteinase K) for 4–12 h. The proteinase K was inactivated by incubation at 95 °C for 5 min prior to PCR analysis. PCR was carried out in 20-μl reaction mixtures using Taq Platinum (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's suggestions. For histology, embryos were fixed overnight in 3% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline, dehydrated, and embedded in paraffin. Ten-micron sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Northern Blotting Analysis—Total RNA was isolated from wild type, heterozygous, and mutant mouse embryonic fibroblasts. Messenger RNA was purified using an Oligotex mRNA isolation kit (Qiagen). Each mRNA sample (5 μg) was separated in a glyoxal-agarose gel, transferred to nylon membranes, and hybridized with a 32P-labeled cDNA probe generated by PCR reaction using wjy1 and wjy3 under the conditions described earlier (19Yang W. Mansour S.L. Dev. Dyn. 1999; 215: 108-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The same probe was also used to hybridize to a membrane containing RNAs derived from different mice tissues obtained at different developmental stages (Clontech). Antibody Generation and Western Blotting Analysis—A Dicer-specific antibody was generated against a peptide corresponding to the C terminus of the mouse Dicer protein with an amino acid sequence of H-Cys-Leu-Arg-Ser-Leu-Lys-Ala-Asn-Gln-Pro-Gln-Val-Pro-Asn-Ser-OH. Proteins (100 μg) from whole embryos of wild type or dicerex1/2 embryos at E14.5 were fractionated on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel (4–20%) and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. The membranes were probed with a rabbit anti-Tie1 antibody (Research Diagnostics, Inc.) at 2 μg/ml, a rabbit anti-Glut1 antibody (Alpha Diagnostics) at 2 μg/ml, a mouse anti-actin antibody (Sigma) at 1:10,000, a rabbit anti-Dicer antiserum (Anaspec) at 1:500, or a rabbit anti-PTEN antibody (Upstate) at 1:1000 and, subsequently, with appropriate peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies. The signals were detected with a Supersignal West Femto maximum sensitivity substrate (Pierce). TaqMan RT-PCR Analysis—Total RNA was isolated from wild type and mutant embryos using TRIzol (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Messenger RNA was purified using an Oligotex mRNA isolation kit (Qiagen). The mRNA (10 ng) was subjected to quantitative RT-PCR analysis using 300 nm primers and 200 nm probe in 25-μl reaction mixtures. TaqMan probes and primers used for the reactions were as follows: ang-1 probe, 5′-CAGAAAACGGAGGGAGAAGATATAACCGGA-3′; ang-1 forward primer, 5′-GCAACCAGCGCCGAAAT-3′; ang-1 reverse primer, 5′-GGCACATTGCCCATGTTGA-3′; ang-2 probe, 5′-ATACAAAGAGGGCTTCGGGAGCCCTC-3′; ang-2 forward primer, 5′-GACTTCCAGAGGACGTGGAAAG-3′; ang-2 reverse primer, 5′-CTCATTGCCCAGCCAGTACTC-3′; flt1 probe, 5′-ACACCTGTCGCGTGAAGAGTGGGTC-3′; flt-1 forward primer, 5′-CAATGTGGAGAGCCGAGACA-3′; flt-1 reverse primer, 5′-GAGGTGTTGAAAGACTGGAACGA-3′; kdr probe, 5′-CTGGCTCCTTCTTGTCATTGTCCTACGG-3′; kdr forward primer, 5′-ACTGCAGTGATTGCCATGTTCT-3′; kdr reverse primer, 5′-TCATTGGCCCGCTTAACG-3′; tie-1 probe, 5′-ACCCCGTGCTGGAGTGGGAGG-3′; tie-1 forward primer, 5′-CACAGCCTGAGCCCTTGAGT-3′; tie-1 reverse primer, 5′-CCTATGAGGTCCTCAAAGGTGATG-3′; vegf probe, 5′-CCGCTGATGCGCTGTGCAGG-3′; vegf forward primer, 5′-CATCTTCAAGCCGTCCTGTGT-3′; vegf reverse primer, 5′-CTCCAGGGCTTCATCGTTACA-3′. The pten probe and primer sets were obtained as a 20× mixture from Applied Biosystems. In Situ Hybridization and Immunohistochemistry—An ∼400-bp dicer 3′-cDNA fragment was generated by PCR reactions from an E11.5 limb cDNA library (Stratagene) using the primers 5′-GACTTGCACACGGAGCAGTG-3′ and 5′-GCATCTCCCAGGAATTCTAAG-3′. This fragment was cloned into a pGEM-T easy vector (Promega). Sense and antisense digoxigenin-labeled riboprobes were synthesized using T7 and SP6 RNA polymerases, respectively. E10.5 embryos from white Swiss mice (Harland) were collected and processed for in situ hybridization as described (20Henrique D. Adam J. Myat A. Chitnis A. Lewis J. Ish-Horowicz D. Nature. 1995; 375: 787-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (922) Google Scholar) and photographed. PECAM immunohistochemistry of yolk sacs were performed as described (21Suri C. Jones P.F. Patan S. Maisonpierre P.C. Davis S. Sato T.N. Yancopoulos G.D. Cell. 1996; 87: 1171-1180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2406) Google Scholar). The dicer Gene Is Expressed in Mouse Embryos and Adult Tissues—To determine the relative levels of dicer expression during development, a dicer cDNA probe (400 bp) was hybridized to mRNAs isolated from mouse embryos at various developmental stages (Fig. 1A). A relatively low level of the dicer transcript (∼6.5 kb) was detected in 7-day old embryos. Levels of this transcript were significantly higher in 11-day embryos and remained constant through 17-day embryos, suggesting that Dicer may function during this period of development. To further determine the spatial expression patterns of dicer in developing embryos, in situ hybridization analysis of RNA was performed. At E10.5, the dicer mRNA was detected at similar levels throughout the embryos (Fig. 1D). The expression of dicer in several adult tissues was also examined. Interestingly, dicer was strongly expressed in the heart, liver, and kidney. This suggests that Dicer may have a more specialized function in these organs. Recently, Lagos-Quintana et al. (18Lagos-Quintana M. Rauhut R. Yalcin A. Meyer J. Lendeckel W. Tuschl T. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 735-739Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2779) Google Scholar) identified 34 novel miRNAs by tissuespecific cloning of ∼21-nucleotide RNAs from adult mice, many of which were derived from the heart, kidney, and liver. Thus, this finding is consistent with expression profiles of dicer in these organs. Low levels of dicer expression were also observed in the brain, spleen, lung, skeletal muscle, and testis (Fig. 1B). Generation of dicerex1/2 via Gene Targeting—To determine the in vivo function of Dicer during development, a targeting vector was designed to disrupt the dicer by replacing the first two exons of the dicer gene with a neo expression cassette through homologous recombination in embryonic stem cells (Fig. 2A). The construct was introduced into E14 embryonic stem cells, which were cultured under standard selective conditions. G418 resistant clones were analyzed via Southern blotting analysis using both 3′- and 5′-flanking probes (Fig. 2A). The 3′-probe detected an 8-kb DNA fragment from the targeted allele and a >14-kb fragment from the wild type allele (Fig. 2B). Among the 132 clones screened, six contained the targeted allele. Southern blotting analysis with a neo probe further confirmed that all six were single integrants (data not shown). Cells of three targeted clones were microinjected into blastocysts of C57BL/6(B6) animals to generate germline chimeras. A PCR-based assay was developed for identification of the possible genotypes (Fig. 2C). A Northern blotting analysis with a cDNA probe from exons 1 and 2 revealed that these sequences were absent in the cells from homozygous mutant embryos (Fig. 2D). However, a smaller sized transcript was detectable in homozygous mutant cells with a 3′-cDNA probe (data not shown). A 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA end (RACE) analysis indicated that this transcript originated from exon 3 (data not shown). A Western blotting analysis with a Dicer antibody detected a band from lysates of E14.5 mutants (Fig. 3A). The translation of this protein is probably initiated from the AUG codon in exon 4, which is in frame with the start codon of dicer. To determine whether this truncated protein still retains function, a Western blotting analysis was carried out to examine the expression level of several miRNA targets. The pten and ang-1 genes have been identified as targets that are subjected to miRNA regulation (22Lewis B.P. Shih I. Jones-Rhoades M.W. Bartel D.P. Burge C.B. Cell. 2004; 115: 787-798Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (4249) Google Scholar). Our Western blotting analysis showed that the expressions of both proteins were much higher in dicerex1/2 embryos than those in wild type embryos (Fig. 3A). However, RT-PCR analysis showed that the transcript levels both genes in dicerex1/2 embryos were similar to those in wild type embryos (Fig. 3B). Thus, these results have confirmed that both the pten and the ang-1 genes are subjected to post-transcriptional regulation by miRNAs. Together, these results show that the amino acid sequence corresponding to the first two exons of dicer is essential for the function of the protein and that the dicerex1/2 is a severe hypomorphic allele.Fig. 3Compromised miRNA processing in dicerex1/2 mutants.A, Western blotting analysis of proteins (100 ug) extracted from whole embryos of wild type (+/+) and dicerex1/2 at E14.5.

Heterozygous animals were viable, healthy, and did not exhibit any overt abnormalities. To obtain homozygous mutants, heterozygous carriers were intercrossed, and the resulting offspring were genotyped. Of 59 mice born, none was a homozygous mutant, indicating that dicerex1/2 animals were not viable. To further determine the timing of the lethality, embryos from heterozygous intercrosses were analyzed at various developmental stages. At E10.5, dicerex1/2 embryos appeared morphologically normal (data not shown). However, starting from E11.5, virtually all dicerex1/2 embryos were growth and developmentally retarded as compared with their wild type or heterozygous litter mates (Fig. 4, A–D and F–I). Histological analyses of E12.5 mutant embryos revealed that they had overtly normal structures, except that they were smaller and slightly underdeveloped (data not shown). The number of dicerex1/2 embryos obtained was within normal Mendelian distribution up to this stage, although resorbed embryos were found at these stages as well (Table I). Most of the dicerex1/2 embryos recovered at E13.5 and E14.5 were morphologically abnormal and nonviable. The few viable ones all had various degrees of edema (Fig. 4, H and I). Noticeably, these mutant embryos appeared to be very pale with smaller livers. The blood vessels in these mutants were thin and suboptimally developed (arrowheads in Fig. 4, D and I). No viable embryos were retrieved beyond E14.5, indicating that dicerex1/2 embryos died between E12.5 and 14.5.Table IGenotyping analysis of embryos obtained from heterozygous intercrossesAge/stageGenotypeResorbedTotal+/++/--/-Weaning20390NAaNot applicable59E16.5381bEmbryos not viable012E15.56140525E14.5193412cSome embryos not viable368E13.58234cSome embryos not viable237E12.582910047E11.58145229E10.512247245a Not applicableb Embryos not viablec Some embryos not viable Open table in a new tab Defects in the Yolk Sacs of dicerex1/2 Embryos—In addition to the embryonic phenotypes, yolk sacs from mutant embryos were abnormal as well. As early as E10.5 a subset of dicerex1/2 yolk sacs started to display phenotypes different from those of wild type or heterozygous controls. In general, they appeared pale (Fig. 5, A and D), and this phenomenon became more pronounced in yolk sacs from older embryos. Microscopic examination revealed that there were fewer blood vessels in the dicerex1/2 yolk sacs and that these vessels were thin, small, and less organized than those of control yolk sacs (Fig. 5, B, C, E, and F). In some extreme cases, there appeared to be no yolk sac blood vessels at all (data not shown). Together, these observations indicate that Dicer may be required for blood vessel development during embryogenesis. Impaired Angiogenesis in dicerex1/2 Embryos and Their Yolk Sacs—To analyze vascular network formation, yolk sacs from E11.5 embryos were stained with anti-PECAM antibodies specific to the endothelial cell. The blood vessels in yolk sacs from wild type embryos at this stage were well into vascular remodeling and formed an orderly arranged network of blood vessels with large vitelline arteries and veins branching in a fractal pattern to smaller vessels (Fig. 5G). In contrast, the blood vessels in dicerex1/2 yolk sacs were thin and disorganized (Fig. 5H). However, the presence of a honeycomb-like primary vascular structure indicates that vasculogenesis and the initial steps of angiogenesis proceeded normally in the mutants. Hence, these observations suggested that in the absence of a fully functional Dicer, either angiogenesis failed to go to completion and/or that the formed vessels could not be maintained or stabilized. Whole mount PECAM staining of E14.5 embryos also revealed defects in the angiogenesis of mutant embryos proper. The tree-like blood vessel structures observed in the wild type embryos (Fig. 4E) were absent in mutant embryos (Fig. 4J). Instead, there were many disorganized vascular structures. Again, the presence of vascular bedding suggests that Dicer is not required for vasculogenesis and early differentiation of the endothelial cells. These immunohistochemical data suggest that Dicer is required for the proper angiogenesis of both the embryos and their yolk sacs. Altered Expression of vegf, flt1, kdr, and tie1 in dicerex1/2Embryos—The vascular defects observed in the dicerex1/2 embryos prompted us to examine the expression of several crucial genes involved in embryonic angiogenesis. Messenger RNA was isolated from pooled E14.5 wild type and dicerex1/2 embryos and subjected to TaqMan RT-PCR analysis. Interestingly, the mRNA levels of vegf and the genes of its receptors, flt1 and kdr, in dicerex1/2 embryos were significantly higher than those in wild type embryos. On the contrary, the mRNA level of tie-1, a receptor tyrosine kinase gene, was lower in the mutant embryos (Fig. 6A). These results were confirmed by quantitative RT-PCR analysis of individual embryos at the same stage (data not shown). The reduction of the Tie-1 protein level in dicerex1/2 embryos was further confirmed by Western blotting analysis (Fig. 6B). Thus, these results indicate that the impaired angiogenesis in dicerex1/2 embryos is probably due to the altered expression levels of angiogenesis regulators in the cell. These results also indicate that Dicer probably exerts its regulatory function on embryonic angiogenesis through the processing of miRNA molecules that control the expression levels of angiogenesis regulators. We have attempted to disrupt the dicer gene via homologous recombination in embryonic stem cells. Because exon 1 contains the putative translation initiation codon AUG, we reasoned that an elimination of the first two exons of the mouse dicer gene with a neo expression cassette should abolish the expression of a functional Dicer protein. However, to our surprise we detected a protein with a size of ∼220 kDa in dicerex1/2 embryos. This protein is probably synthesized by using the in-frame AUG in exon 4, although this codon is not preceded with a consensus Kozak sequence. As one of the primary roles for Dicer is to generate miRNAs, and because hundreds of miRNA targets have recently been identified (22Lewis B.P. Shih I. Jones-Rhoades M.W. Bartel D.P. Burge C.B. Cell. 2004; 115: 787-798Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (4249) Google Scholar), we sought to investigate whether the truncated Dicer protein still retains function by examining the RNA and protein levels of the putative miRNA target genes, pten and ang-1, in the mutant and wild type embryos. Our findings that the levels of both gene products were significantly higher in the mutant embryos than in the wild type embryos but that their transcript levels were similar clearly indicate that Dicer function is severely compromised in mutant embryos. Recently, Bernstein et al. also reported the embryonic lethality for their dicer knock-out animals (23Bersnstein E. Kim S.Y. Carmell M.A. Murchison E.P. Alcorn H. Li M.Z. Mills A.A. Elledge S.J. Anderson K.V. Hannon G.J. Nat. Genet. 2003; 35: 213-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). In their study, however, the dicer-/- embryos died around E7.5, which is much earlier than the time for dicerex1/2 embryos obtained in this study. Therefore, these results show that dicerex1/2 is a severe hypomorphic allele. The absence of live offspring of dicerex1/2 demonstrates that Dicer is essential for normal development. This finding is consistent with the hypothesis that Dicer has a developmental role, probably through its ability to process miRNAs. Further analyses of embryos between E10.5 to 16.5 revealed that the dicerex1/2 embryos die at E12.5–E14.5, with notable defects in vascular structures. The formation of blood vessels during embryonic development consists of two distinct processes: 1) vasculogenesis, in which angioblasts differentiate and proliferate in situ to form the primary vascular network (24Risau W. Flamme I. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1995; 11: 73-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (1362) Google Scholar, 25Risau W. Nature. 1997; 386: 671-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (4867) Google Scholar); and 2) angiogenesis, a process that modifies the primitive vessel structures through sprouting and vessel enlargement to form the branching patterns of the mature vasculature (26Yancopoulos G.D. Davis S. Gale N.W. Rudge J.S. Wiegand S.J. Holash J. Nature. 2000; 407: 242-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (3298) Google Scholar). In the absence of Dicer, vasculogenesis in both the yolk sacs and the embryos seems to proceed normally. Therefore, Dicer may not be required for the differentiation and proliferation of endothelial cells. The initiation of angiogenesis is probably not affected by the absence of Dicer either, because the first sign of yolk sac defects arises at E10.5, and only a subset of dicerex1/2 yolk sacs appeared to be abnormal. Branching vessels can also be found in yolk sacs of some E14.5 dicerex1/2 embryos. Also, in the mutant embryos proper the dorsal aortae, the intersomitic arteries, and the limb bud vasculature all appeared to be present. These observations indicate that Dicer is specifically required for the maintenance of blood vessel integrity during late embryogenesis. Analyses of the expression of several important regulators for embryonic vasculogenesis and angiogenesis revealed an alteration in their expression levels. Interestingly, the phenotypes of our dicerex1/2 embryos are similar to those of the Tie1deficient embryos. Both mutant embryos exhibit vascular defects, moderate edema, and die around days 13.5 and 14.5 of gestation. The receptor tyrosine kinase Tie1 has been shown to be required cell autonomously for the integrity and survival of vascular endothelial cells during late embryogenesis (27Puri M.C. Rossant J. Alitalo K. Bernstein A. Partanen J. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5884-5891Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). Chimeric analyses indicate that Tie1 is not required for the early differentiation of endothelial cells, nor is it required for the early phase of angiogenic vessel growth. Rather, Tie-1 functions to support capillary endothelial cell proliferation (28Partanen J. Puri M.C. Schwartz L. Fischer K.-D. Bernstein A. Rossant J. Development. 1996; 122: 3013-3021Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, Tie-1 was also shown to activate phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and Akt to inhibit apoptosis (29Kontos C.D. Cha E.H. York J.D. Peters K.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 1704-1713Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). In E14.5 dicerex1/2 embryos, the mRNA level of tie1 was decreased to ∼28% of that in the wild type embryos. As a result, the TIE-1 protein also decreased dramatically in the mutant embryos. Therefore, this decreased expression of Tie-1 could lead to the apoptosis of endothelial cells, thereby causing the collapse of blood vessels in the mutant embryos. VEGF is one of the most important growth factors for blood vessel formation, as it is required for both vasculogenesis and angiogenic sprouting. Developing mouse embryos are very sensitive to the level of VEGF. A slight variation in the VEGF level during vessel formation can cause severe vascular defects, eventually leading to embryonic lethality. For example, disruption of even a single allele of vegf in mice results in severe vascular abnormalities and embryonic lethality (30Carmeliet P. Ferreira V. Breier G. Pollefeyt S. Kieckens L. Gertsenstein M. Fahrig M. Vandenhoeck A. Harpal K. Eberhardt C. Declercq C. Pawling J. Moons L. Collen D. Risau W. Nagy A.

Nature. 1996; 380: 439-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (3062) Google Scholar), whereas an inappropriate induction of VEGF results in the formation of immature and leaky vessels (32Adamis A.P. Miller J.W.

Med. 1994; 331: 1480-1487Crossref PubMed Scopus (3436) Google Scholar). VEGF mainly functions through its binding to the receptors Flt-1 and Kdr. It has been shown that oxygen homeostasis plays an important role in the regulation of angiogenesis. The transcription of the VEGF gene is up-regulated via hypoxia-inducible factor-1 under hypoxic conditions. Although increased VEGF expression in a hypoxic environment can promote vessel outgrowth, the formed vessels tend to be leaky, exhibiting disorganized patterns (34Sohn S.J. Sarvis B.K. Cado D. Winoto A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 43344-43351Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Hypoxia also up-regulates Flt-1 and Kdr in cultured cells (35Gerber H.P. Condorelli F. Park J. Ferrara N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23659-23667Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar, 36Waltenberger J. Mayr U. Pentz S. Hombach V. Circulation. 1996; 94: 1647-1654Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). In E14.5 dicerex1/2 embryos, vegf, flt-1, and kdr levels are significantly higher than those in wild type embryos. This increased expression most likely results from the disrupted vessel structures, which subsequently cause compromised circulation and hypoxic condition in these mutant embryos. Consistent with this hypothesis, a dramatic increase in the level of Glut1, a known hypoxia-inducible factor-1 target gene and a hypoxia marker, was observed in the dicerex1/2 embryos (Fig. 6B). Because the primary function of Dicer in vivo is to process miRNAs, our results suggest that embryonic angiogenesis might also be regulated by miRNAs. Because all miRNAs studied so far seem to act as post-transcriptional repressors of their targets, a defective Dicer is expected to cause a defect in the processing of miRNAs, which leads to overexpression of their target genes in the mutant embryos. This prediction has been confirmed, because the expression levels of Ang-1 and PTEN were significantly higher in the mutant embryos than those in the wild type embryos. Thus, the dicerex1/2 embryos can be a very valuable system for the validation of miRNA targets in nature. Finally, miRNAs from the mir-80 family have been implicated in the control of developmental cell death and/or cell proliferation (37Carrington J.C. Ambros V. Science. 2003; 301: 336-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (1510) Google Scholar). It is possible that miRNAs related to the mir-80 family also regulate endothelial cell proliferation/death in mice during development.

The 121-amino acid sequence of GRFT has been determined, and biologically active GRFT was subsequently produced by expression of a corresponding DNA sequence in Escherichia coli. Both native and recombinant GRFT displayed potent antiviral activity against laboratory strains and primary isolates of T- and M- tropic HIV-1 with EC50 values ranging from 0.043 to 0.63 nm. GRFT also aborted cell-to-cell fusion and transmission of HIV-1 infection at similar concentrations. High concentrations (e.g. 783 nm) of GRFT were not lethal to any tested host cell types. GRFT blocked CD4-dependent glycoprotein (gp) 120 binding to receptor-expressing cells and bound to viral coat glycoproteins (gp120, gp41, and gp160) in a glycosylation-dependent manner. GRFT preferentially inhibited gp120 binding of the monoclonal antibody (mAb) 2G12, which recognizes a carbohydrate-dependent motif, and the (mAb) 48d, which binds to CD4-induced epitope. In addition, GRFT moderately interfered with the binding of gp120 to sCD4. Further data showed that the binding of GRFT to soluble gp120 was inhibited by the monosaccharides glucose, mannose, and N-acetylglucosamine but not by galactose, xylose, fucose, N-acetylgalactosamine, or sialic acid-containing glycoproteins. Taken together these data suggest that GRFT is a new type of lectin that binds to various viral glycoproteins in a monosaccharide-dependent manner. GRFT could be a potential candidate microbicide to prevent the sexual transmission of HIV and AIDS.

The dominant mode of transmission of the virus is through heterosexual contact, which accounts for up to 90% of all HIV infections (2NIAID Fact Sheet: HIV Infection in Women. 2004; (www.niaid.nih.gov/factsheets/womenhiv.html)Google Scholar). The highly mutable nature of HIV and the daunting complexities of developing a broadly protective vaccine against the multiple clades of HIV are increasingly apparent (3Stratov I. DeRose R. Purcell D.F. Kent S.J. Curr. Drug Targets. 2004; 5: 71-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 4Garber D.A. Feinberg M.B. AIDS Rev. 2003; 5: 131-139PubMed Google Scholar, 5Tramont E.C. Johnston M.I. Expert Opin. Emerg. Drugs. 2003; 8: 37-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). With no vaccine on the horizon, there is a pressing need to develop anti-HIV microbicides to prevent the sexual transmission of HIV. In recent years, the overall proportion of HIV-positive females has steadily increased. As of December 2003, women accounted for nearly 50% of all people living with HIV worldwide (1UN Program on HIV/AIDS Report on the Global AIDS Epidemic, 4th Global Report. 2004; (www.unaids.org/bangkok2004/report.html)Google Scholar). In women, the main entry site for HIV is the cervico-vaginal mucosa, and currently the only absolute methods of protection for women are abstinence or condom used by males, neither of which may be a negotiable option for the women. For these reasons, health organizations worldwide have stated that the development of a female-controlled topical virucide for HIV is an urgent global priority (1UN Program on HIV/AIDS Report on the Global AIDS Epidemic, 4th Global Report. 2004; (www.unaids.org/bangkok2004/report.html)Google Scholar, 2NIAID Fact Sheet: HIV Infection in Women. 2004; (www.niaid.nih.gov/factsheets/womenhiv.html)Google Scholar, 6Piot P. AIDS. 2001; 15: 4Crossref Scopus (2) Google Scholar). Natural products have historically been a source for the discovery of novel therapeutic agents. It has been reported that over 60% of the anti-tumor and anti-infective agents that were approved as drugs from 1983 to 1994 owe their structural origin to compounds derived from nature (7Cragg G.M. Newman D.J. Iwu M.M. Wootton J. Ethnomedicine and Drug Discovery. 1st Ed. Elsevier Science Publishers B.V., Amsterdam2002: 23-37Google Scholar). The NCI, National Institutes of Health, has long had a program investigating anti-HIV activity in natural product extracts (8Boyd M.R. DeVita V.T. Hellman S. Rosenberg S.A. AIDS: Etiology, Diagnosis, Treatment, and Prevention. 2nd Ed. J. B. Lippincott, Philadelphia1988: 305-319Google Scholar). Our laboratory has also been particularly interested in the elucidation of protein and peptide leads that might reveal unprecedented mechanisms of anti-HIV activity and/or serve as templates for discovery and development of novel, small molecule inhibitors of HIV infection (9O'Keefe B.R. J. Nat. Prod. 2001; 64: 1373-1381Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Such leads are also potentially attractive for microbicide development. Examples of such proteinaceous leads are cyanovirin-N (CV-N) and scytovirin isolated from aqueous extracts of the cyanobacterium, Nostoc ellipsosporum and Scytonema varium, respectively (10Boyd M.R. Gustafson K.R. McMahon J.B. Shoemaker R.H. O'Keefe B.R. Mori T. Gulakowski R.J. Wu L. Rivera M.I. Laurencot C.M. Currens M.J. Cardellina II, J.H. Buckheit Jr., R.W. Nara P.L. Pannell L.K.

Both of these antiviral proteins were discovered in extracts of cyanobacteria. Here we report the isolation of a unique anti-HIV protein from a marine red alga. Aqueous extracts of the red alga Griffithsia sp. collected from the waters off New Zealand showed potent cytoprotective activity against HIV-1-induced cytopathicity in T-lymphoblastoid cells. No presence of this activity was seen in the organic extract of this alga. Previous chemical investigations of Griffithsia sp. have detailed the isolation of a variety of metabolites, including photosynthetic pigments (12Ganzon-Fortes E.T. J. Appl. Phycol. 1997; 9: 525-532Google Scholar) and polysaccharides (13Gretz M.R. Mollet J. Falshaw R. Townsend R.R. Hotchkiss A.T. Techniques in Glycobiology. Marcel Dekker/CRC Press Inc., New York1997: 613-628Google Scholar). Griffithsia sp. has also been studied for its production of phycoerythrin proteins (14Kaixian Q. Franklin M. Borowitzka M.A. Appl. Biochem. Biotechnol. 1993; 43: 133-139Crossref Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 15Carra P.O. Biochem. J. 1965; 94: 171-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). These brightly colored pigments have shown great utility as fluorescent labels for a variety of biochemical studies. Neither the organic constituents of Griffithsia sp. nor the phycoerythrins have ever been reported to have antiviral activity. In this study, we describe the isolation and characterization of the novel, potent anti-HIV protein, griffithsin (GRFT), from the aqueous extract of Griffithsia sp. The data presented here suggest that GRFT represents another potential candidate microbicide to prevent the sexual transmission of HIV and AIDS.

Peridinin chlorophyll protein (PerCP)-conjugated anti-Leu3a mAbs were obtained from Immunocytometry Systems. CV-N, recombinantly expressed in Escherichia coli, was prepared as described elsewhere (17Mori T. Gustafson K.R. Pannell L.K. Shoemaker R.H. Wu L. McMahon J.B. Boyd M.R. Protein Expression Purif. 1998; 12: 151-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The following anti-gp120 mAbs were obtained through the AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda): HIV-1 gp120 mAb 2G12 (conformational and carbohydrate-dependent) from Dr. H. Katinger; IgG1 b12 (CD4-binding site) from Drs. D. Burton and C. Barbas; 48d (CD4-induced epitope) and 17b (CD4-induced epitope) from Dr. J. Robinson; ID6 (C1 region) from Drs. K. Ugen and D. Weiner; and 489.1 (C1 region), 4G10 (V3 loop), IIIB-V3-21 (V3 loop), and IIIB-V3-01 (V3 loop) from Dr. J. Laman. The soluble CD4 (sCD4), glycosylated and nonglycosylated gp120 (HIV-1SF2 gp120), HL2/3, and HeLa CD4 LTR β-galactosidase cell lines and HIV-1 M-tropic (Ba-L and ADA) and T-tropic (IIIB) isolates were also obtained through the AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program (National Institutes of Health). Collection and Classification of the Red Algae Griffithsia—The rhodophyte Griffithsia sp. (Ceramiaceae) (voucher Q66D336) was collected on a rocky reef 100 meters off the eastern shore of Chatham Island, New Zealand. The red alga was collected at a depth of 5–15 m by scuba divers. A second collection of Griffithsia sp. (voucher Q66C5379) was collected in Fiordland, New Zealand, at a depth of 10 m. Both collections and identifications were made by the University of Canterbury (New Zealand) under the auspices of a contract administered by the NCI Natural Products Branch (Developmental Therapeutics Program, Division of Cancer Treatment and Diagnosis, NCI, National Institutes of Health). Voucher specimens for both collections are held at the Smithsonian Institution (Washington, D. C). Extraction and Isolation—A cell-based, virally induced cytopathicity bioassay was used to guide fractionation and to track the isolation of GRFT. In brief, the cellular mass from Griffithsia was harvested by filtration, freeze-dried, and extracted first with H2O followed by MeOH/CH2Cl2 (1:1). Individual aliquots of the organic and aqueous extracts were tested for cytoprotective properties in the NCI primary anti-HIV screen (18Weislow O.S. Kiser R. Fine D.L. Bader J. Shoemaker R.H. Boyd M.R. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1989; 81: 577-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (729) Google Scholar). Only the H2O extract showed anti-HIV activity. Freeze-dried aqueous extract (10 g) was brought up in distilled, deionized H2O at a concentration of 50 mg/ml and maintained on ice. Following centrifugation, the supernatant was brought to 75% saturation with (NH4)2SO4; the protein was allowed to precipitate on ice overnight, and the solution was then centrifuged at 3,000 rpm for 50 min. The pellet was resuspended with 1 m (NH4)2SO4 followed again by precipitation and centrifugation. Finally, the second pellets were saved, and the resulting supernatant was filtered (0.22-μm filter) and subjected to hydrophobic interaction chromatography. A BioCad Sprint work station (PerSeptive Biosystems) was used for the following column chromatographic steps. This protein solution was injected onto a Poros PE column (10 × 100 mm, PerSeptive Biosystems) pre-equilibrated with a starting buffer of 50 mm sodium phosphate, 1.5 m (NH4)2SO4, pH 7.5. The column was then eluted at a flow rate of 15 ml/min over the following gradients: 1) 7 column volumes (CV, equal to 7.85 ml) of the starting buffer; 2) 1.5–0 m (NH4)2SO4 over 2 CV; and 3) 0 m (NH4)2SO4 for 7 CV. The eluate was monitored for both conductivity and absorbance (280 nm). Final (NH4)2SO4 concentration in the void fraction possessing anti-HIV activity was brought to 75% saturation to precipitate the proteins on ice overnight, and the mixture was then centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 50 min. The distilled, deionized H2O-resuspended pellets were first concentrated by a 10-kDa molecular mass limit membrane (Amicon), dialyzed against 0.02% sodium azide, and then brought up to a concentration of 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5. This solution was then injected onto a Poros HQ anion exchange column (10 × 100 mm, PerSeptive Biosystems) pre-equilibrated with a starting buffer of 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5. The column was eluted at a flow rate of 15 ml/min using the following gradients: 1) 5 CV of the starting buffer; 2) 0–1 m sodium chloride over 20 CV; and 3) 1 m sodium chloride for 5 CV. The eluate was monitored for absorbance (280 nm). Active fractions from the HQ column were concentrated and desalted by 10-kDa molecular mass limit membrane, subjected to a Bio-RP C4 reversed-phase column (4.6 × 100 mm, Covance), and eluted at a flow rate of 4 ml/min using the following gradients: 1) 10 CV of the starting buffer of 5% acetonitrile in H2O; 2) 5–95% acetonitrile in H2O over 2.5 CV; and 3) 95% acetonitrile in H2O for 5 CV. The eluate was monitored for absorbance (280 nm), and the active fraction was pooled, lyophilized, and resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), pH 7.4. The protein solution was finally injected onto a G3000PW gel permeation column (21.5 × 600 mm, Toso Haas) and eluted with PBS, pH 7.4, at a flow rate of 5 ml/min. Native molecular weight was determined by calibrating standard proteins (albumin (68 kDa), cytochrome c (12.5 kDa), and aprotinin (6.5 kDa)) by their retention time (absorbance 280 nm) and comparing the resulting calibration curve to the retention time of the active protein. Molecular mass and purity (≥99%) of GRFT were confirmed by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS), and the protein concentrations were determined by amino acid analysis. Production of Anti-GRFT Polyclonal Antibodies—A New Zealand White rabbit was immunized with 100 μg of GRFT in Freund's complete adjuvant. Booster injections of 50 μg of GRFT in Freund's incomplete adjuvant were administered on days 13, 29, 51, 64, 100, and 195. On days 7, 21, 42, 63, 78, and 112, 10 ml of blood was removed from the rabbit. On day 212, the rabbit was sacrificed and bled out. The IgG fraction of the immune sera of the rabbit was isolated by protein-A-Sepharose affinity chromatography (Bio-Rad) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Reactivity of the polyclonal antibodies for GRFT was demonstrated by immunoblot and ELISA studies with 1:250 to 1:5000 of the rabbit immunoglobulin fractions. SDS-PAGE Analysis and Immunoblotting—All the reagents used for SDS-PAGE were from Invitrogen. For SDS-PAGE analysis, samples were mixed with Tricine-SDS sample buffer containing 2% 2-mercaptoethanol, run on a 16% Tris-Tricine gel with Tricine-SDS running buffer, and stained by Coomassie Blue. Pre-stained molecular weight standards (SeeBlue Plus2) from Invitrogen were used. For immunoblotting, samples were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes following SDS-PAGE, according to standard procedures. The membranes were blocked with 3% BSA in PBS and incubated for 1 h with anti-GRFT polyclonal antibodies, washed three times with PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 (PBST), and then treated with goat anti-rabbit IgG antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Sigma). After three washes with PBST, bound antibodies were visualized by incubating membranes in a solution of 0.05% 3,3′-diaminobenzidine and 0.003% H2O2. Amino Acid Analysis, N-terminal Amino Acid Sequencing, and Mass Spectrometry—Amino acid analysis was done by using a Beckman model 6300 automated amino acid analyzer according to the manufacturer's protocol. N-terminal amino acid sequencing was performed on Applied Biosystems model 474A and 494A sequencers according to the manufacturer's protocols. Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionizationtime of flight mass spectroscopy (MALDI-TOF MS) was done using Kratos Kompact Maldi III instrument (Shimadzu) operated in a linear mode using sinapinic acid as a matrix and trypsin as an external standard. ESI-MS was performed with a JEOL SX102 equipped with an Analytica electrospray source. The spectrometer was calibrated using a lysozyme standard (molecular weight = 14,305.2) prior to each analysis. Samples were injected into the source in a 1:1 solution of hexafluoroisopropanol and 2% acetic acid. Chemical and Enzymatic Cleavages of GRFT—GRFT was subjected to digestion with cyanogen bromide (CNBr) and a variety of endoproteinases (Lys-C, Arg-C, and Asp-N) per the manufacturer's instructions. The cleaved peptide products were purified by reversed-phase HPLC using a gradient of 0.05% aqueous trifluoroacetic acid for 20 min and then increasing to 60% acetonitrile in 0.05% aqueous trifluoroacetic acid over 100 min. Amino acid sequences were determined by sequential Edman degradation using an Applied Biosystems model 474 or 494 sequencer according to the protocols of the manufacturer, and the masses of cleaved peptides were analyzed by MALDI-TOF MS. Assays for Anti-HIV Activities—An XTT-tetrazolium-based assay was used to determine the anti-HIV activity of GRFT against a T-tropic laboratory strain (HIV-1RF) in CEM-SS cells as described previously (16Gulakowski R.J. McMahon J.B. Staley P.G. Moran R.A. Boyd M.R. J. Virol. Methods. 1991; 33: 87-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). CEM-SS cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 media without phenol red and supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (BioWhittaker), 2 mm l-glutamine (BioWhittaker), and 50 μg/ml gentamicin (BioWhittaker) (complete medium). Exponentially growing cells were washed and resuspended in complete medium, and a 50-μl aliquot containing 5 × 103 cells was added to individual wells of a 96-well round-bottom microtiter plate containing serial dilutions of GRFT in a volume of 100 μl of medium. Stock supernatants of HIV-1RF were diluted in complete medium to yield sufficient cytopathicity (80–90% cell kill in 6 days), and a 50-μl aliquot was added to appropriate wells. Plates were incubated for 6 days at 37 °C and then stained for cellular viability using 2,3-bis-[2-methoxy-4-nitro-5-sulfophenyl]-2H-tetrazolium-5-carboxanilide inner salt (XTT), p24 antigen production, supernatant reverse-transcriptase activity. To test the anti-HIV activity of GRFT against HIV primary isolates in fresh human cells, monocyte-tropic HIV-1 strains Ba-L and ADA were obtained from the NIAID AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda). The low passage HIV-1 pediatric isolate ROJO was derived as described previously (19Buckheit Jr., R.W. Roberson J.L. Lackman-Smith C. Wyatt J.R. Vickers T.A. Ecker D.J. AIDS Res. Hum. Retroviruses. 1994; 10: 1497-1506Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Human peripheral blood mononuclear cells and macrophages were isolated from hepatitis and HIV seronegative donors following Ficoll-Paque centrifugation as described elsewhere (20Gartner S. Popovic M. Aldovini A. Walker B. Techniques in HIV Research. Stockton Press, New York1990: 59-63Google Scholar). Antiviral assays were carried out with 3-day-old phytohemagglutinin/interleukin-2 stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells or 6-day-cultured monocyte/macrophages. All antiviral evaluations were performed in triplicate in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, l-glutamate (2 mm), penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml). HIV-1 replication in PBMC (RoJo) and monocyte macrophage (Ba-L and ADA) cultures were determined by measurement of reverse transcriptase activity (21Buckheit Jr., R.W. Hollingshead M.G. Germany-Decker J. White E.L. McMahon J.B. Allen L.B. Ross L.J. Decker W.D. Westbrook L. Shannon W.M. Weislow O. Bader J.P. Boyd M.R. Antiviral Res. 1993; 21: 247-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) in the supernatants or p24 antigen expression by ELISA (Coulter, Hialeah, FL), respectively. Antiviral data were reported as 50% effective concentration (EC50). All assays were carried out at least in triplicate for all viruses and cells. The cell-cell fusions were studied using methods described elsewhere (10Boyd M.R. Gustafson K.R. McMahon J.B. Shoemaker R.H. O'Keefe B.R. Mori T. Gulakowski R.J. Wu L. Rivera M.I. Laurencot C.M. Currens M.J. Cardellina II, J.H. Buckheit Jr., R.W. Nara P.L. Pannell L.K. Sowder II, R.C. Henderson L.E. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1997; 41: 1521-1530Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Uninfected CEM-SS cells (1 × 105 cells/50 μl) were co-cultured with chronically infected CEM/HIV-1RF cells (1 × 103 cells/50 μl) in the presence of various concentrations of GRFT (100 μl) or 100 μl of control medium alone in flat-bottomed 96-well microtiter plates. After 72 h of incubation, the number of syncytia was determined microscopically. Each experimental condition consisted of six replicate samples. Attachment and additional fusion assays were performed as described previously (20Gartner S. Popovic M. Aldovini A. Walker B. Techniques in HIV Research. Stockton Press, New York1990: 59-63Google Scholar) with the modifications listed below. Descriptions and sources of the cell lines have been published previously (20Gartner S. Popovic M. Aldovini A. Walker B. Techniques in HIV Research. Stockton Press, New York1990: 59-63Google Scholar). The HL2/3 and HeLa CD4 LTR β-galactosidase cell lines were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin (100 units/ml), streptomycin (100 μg/ml), and l-glutamine (2 mm). HeLa CD4 LTR β-galactosidase cell lines were also supplemented with G418 (200 μg/ml) and hygromycin (100 μg/ml). Following the interaction of HIV-1IIIB with HeLa CD4 LTR β-galactosidase cells (attachment assay) or the co-culture of HeLa CD4 LTR β-galactosidase and HL2/3 cells (fusion assay), virus replication was detected by chemiluminescence using a single step lysis and detection method (Tropix Gal-Screen™, Bedford, MA). Viral binding to HeLa CD4 LTR β-galactosidase cells was detected as cell-associated p24 antigen following a 1-h adsorption of virus and vigorous washing to remove unbound virus. Chicago Sky Blue, a polysulfonic acid dye inhibitor of HIV attachment and fusion, was used as a positive control for all assays (22Clanton D.J. Moran R.A. McMahon J.B. Weislow O.S. Buckheit Jr., R.W. Hollingshead M.G. Ciminale V. Felber B.K. Pavlakis G.N. Bader J.P. J. Acquired Immune Defic. Syndr. 1992; 5: 771-781PubMed Google Scholar). Pretreatment of HIV-1RF with GRFT—Concentrated HIV-1RF was incubated with medium containing 194 nm of GRFT or with control medium for 60 min at 37 °C. After incubation, the treated and control virus samples were diluted to yield a multiplicity of infection of 0.8 and to dilute the GRFT beyond the effective concentration. The pretreated virus samples (50 μl) were then added to individual wells of a 96-well microplate containing 5 × 103 CEM-SS cells (50 μl) and either 100 μl of medium alone or 194 nm of GRFT. The cultures were incubated for 7 days, and cellular viability was assessed using the XTT assay. Pretreatment of CEM-SS Cells with GRFT—CEM-SS cells were incubated with medium containing 194 nm GRFT or with control medium for 60 min at 37 °C. After incubation, the CEM-SS cells were washed free of GRFT using two centrifugation steps. The pretreated cells were then resuspended in culture medium (5 × 103 cells/50 μl) and added to individual wells of a 96-well microtiter plate containing 100 μl of medium alone or 194 nm of GRFT. A 50-μl aliquot of diluted HIV-1RF was added to appropriate wells to yield a multiplicity of infection of 0.8. The cultures were incubated for 7 days, and cellular viability was assessed using the XTT assay. Flow Cytometric sgp120/Cell-associated CD4 Binding Assay—For the experiments assessing the effect of GRFT on gp120 binding to cellassociated CD4, an immunofluorescence flow cytometry-based sgp120 binding assay was performed by using an assay format reported previously (23Mori T. Boyd M.R. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2001; 45: 664-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The CEM-SS cell line expressing CD4, CXCR4, and CCR5 (2 × 105 per condition) was preincubated at 4 °C for 30 min with blocking buffer (PBS with 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA), 1% fetal bovine serum, and 0.02% sodium azide). A sample containing 167 nm of sgp120 was preincubated with PBS (mock treatment) or 1336 nm GRFT in a total 50-μl volume of PBS for 30 min at room temperature. Free GRFT was washed away twice by blocking buffer. Cells were then incubated with the protein mixture in a total 50-μl volume of washing buffer (PBS with 1% fetal bovine serum and 0.02% sodium azide) at 37 °C for 30 min and washed twice with blocking buffer. Immunofluorescent staining was performed (4 °C for 30 min) using FITC-conjugated anti-gp120 mAb, phycoerythrin-conjugated anti-OKT4 mAb, and PerCP-conjugated anti-Leu3a mAb. Following antibody staining, cells were washed twice with washing buffer prior to analysis on a FACScan flow cytometer, using Cellquest software (Immunocytometry Systems). Cells were gated by forward, and 90° light scatter and at least 10,000 events were acquired for each sample. ELISA Protocols—To determine the affinities of GRFT for a series of standard proteins, 100 ng each of gp160, gp120, gp41, sCD4, bovine IgG, α-acid glycoprotein, and aprotinin were subjected to an ELISA protocol as described previously (10Boyd M.R. Gustafson K.R. McMahon J.B. Shoemaker R.H. O'Keefe B.R. Mori T. Gulakowski R.J. Wu L. Rivera M.I. Laurencot C.M. Currens M.J. Cardellina II, J.H. Buckheit Jr., R.W. Nara P.L. Pannell L.K. Sowder II, R.C. Henderson L.E. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1997; 41: 1521-1530Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the proteins were bound to a 96-well plate, which was then rinsed with PBST and blocked with BSA. Between subsequent steps, the plate was again rinsed with PBST. The wells were incubated with 100 ng of GRFT, followed by incubation with a 1:500 dilution of the anti-GRFT rabbit polyclonal antibody preparation. The bound GRT was determined by adding goat anti-rabbit antibodies conjugated to alkaline phosphatase (Roche Applied Science). Upon addition of the alkaline phosphatase substrate buffer, absorbance was measured at 405 nm for each well. Glycosylation-dependent binding of GRFT to gp120 was examined using an ELISA system as above. Briefly, 100 ng of glycosylated or nonglycosylated gp120 (HIV-1SF2 gp120) was added to the wells of a 96-well plate and incubated for 1 h with serial dilutions of GRFT. The plate was then washed and visualized using anti-GRFT polyclonal antibodies as above. In additional ELISA studies, the plate was prepared as above with glycosylated gp120, and 100 μl/well of a 1 μg/ml (78.3 nm) GRFT was added in the presence or absence of 100 mm concentrations of the following sugars: glucose, mannose, galactose, fucose, xylose, N-acetylglucosamine, N-acetylgalactosamine, or 100 ng/well α-acid glycoprotein (to act as a carrier for sialic acid). The plate was then washed and visualized using anti-GRFT polyclonal antibodies as above. All data points are averages of triplicate measurem"

However, the basis for these activities is not known, i.e. the in vivo substrate(s) for mast cell chymase has not been identified. In this study we show that mice lacking the chymase mouse mast cell protease 4 (mMCP-4) fail to process pro-matrix metalloprotease 9 (pro-MMP-9) to its active form in vivo, whereas both the pro and active form of MMP-9 was found in tissues of wild type mice. Moreover, the processing of pro-MMP-2 into active enzyme was markedly defective in mMCP-4 null animals. Histological analysis revealed an increase in collagen in the ear tissue of mMCP-4-deficient animals accompanied by increased ear thickness and a higher content of hydroxyproline. Furthermore, both lung and ear tissue from the knock-out animals showed a markedly increased staining for fibronectin. MMP-9 and MMP-2 are known to have a range of important activities, but the mechanisms for their activation in vivo have not been clarified previously. The present study thus indicates a key role for mast cell chymase in the regulation of pro-MMP-2 and -9 activities.

When mast cells (MCs) 1The abbreviations used are: MC, mast cell; MMP, matrix metalloprotease; mMCP, mouse mast cell protease; NDST, N-deacetylase/N-sulfotransferase; WT, wild type. are activated, they degranulate and thereby release a panel of powerful preformed inflammatory mediators, including histamine, cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-α, proteoglycans, and various MC-specific proteases (1Metcalfe D.D.

Today. 1989; 10: 381-386Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The MC proteases are divided into three main subclasses, tryptases, chymases, and carboxypeptidase A (3Miller H.R. Pemberton A.D. Immunology. 2002; 105: 375-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 4Caughey G. Mol. Immunol. 2001; 38: 1353-1357Crossref Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 5Huang C. Sali A.

Chymases, serine proteases with chymotrypsin-like substrate specificities, have potent pro-inflammatory properties (8He S. Walls A.F. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1998; 125: 1491-1500Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) and have been implicated in a variety of pathophysiological conditions, e.g. angiogenesis (9Muramatsu M. Yamada M. Takai S. Miyazaki M. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2002; 137: 554-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), heart failure (10Matsumoto T. Wada A. Tsutamoto T. Ohnishi M. Isono T. Kinoshita M. Circulation. 2003; 107: 2555-2558Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar), and fibrosis (11Takai S. Jin D. Sakaguchi M. Katayama S. Muramatsu M. Matsumura E. Kim S. Miyazaki M. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2003; 305: 17-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). However, it has not been possible to determine the mechanism by which chymases influences these processes, i.e. the physiological substrate(s) for chymase has not been identified. Matrix metalloproteases (MMPs) are known to be involved in a variety of physiological and pathological processes and are currently attracting a large clinical interest as potential drug targets in therapeutic intervention with various diseases (12Coussens L.M. Fingleton B. Matrisian L.M. Science. 2002; 295: 2387-2392Crossref PubMed Scopus (2390) Google Scholar, 13Stamenkovic I. J. Pathol. 2003; 200: 448-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (896) Google Scholar, 14Hiratsuka S. Nakamura K. Iwai S. Murakami M. Itoh T. Kijima H. Shipley J.M. Senior R.M. Shibuya M.

The MMPs, similar to most proteolytic enzymes, are synthesized with an N-terminal propeptide that needs to be removed to achieve proteolytic activity. Thus, the physiological processes that lead to propeptide cleavage are imperative in terms of regulating the activity of most proteases (17Nagase H. Biol. Chem. 1997; 378: 151-160PubMed Google Scholar). The MMP family currently comprises >20 members (18Vu T.H. Werb Z. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2123-2133Crossref PubMed Scopus (1056) Google Scholar). The members all share common structural features but differ in regard to substrate specificities, although overlapping substrate specificities between certain members of the MMP family occur. Thus, MMP-2 and -9 share the ability to degrade denatured collagen (gelatin) and are therefore also denoted gelatinases A and B, respectively. Gene-targeting studies have implicated MMP-2 (14Hiratsuka S. Nakamura K. Iwai S. Murakami M. Itoh T. Kijima H. Shipley J.M. Senior R.M. Shibuya M. Cancer Cell. 2002; 2: 289-300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (746) Google Scholar) and MMP-9 (19Coussens L.M. Tinkle C.L. Hanahan D. Werb Z. Cell. 2000; 103: 481-490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1140) Google Scholar) in angiogenesis and tumor metastasis. However, it is not known how these proteases are activated in vivo. A number of in vitro studies have identified potential pro-MMP-9 processing proteases, including MMP-13, MMP-3, tissue kallikrein, MMP-2, plasmin, and MC chymase (20Van den Steen P.E. Dubois B. Nelissen I. Rudd P.M. Dwek R.A. Opdenakker G. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2002; 37: 375-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (749) Google Scholar, 21Fang K.C. Raymond W.W. Blount J.L. Caughey G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25628-25635Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), and it has been shown that a membrane-type MMP (MT1-MMP) can activate pro-MMP-2 (22Strongin A.Y. Collier I. Bannikov G. Marmer B.L. Grant G.A. Goldberg G.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5331-5338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1438) Google Scholar). For most of these proteases, the in vivo relevance of their ability to activate pro-MMP-2 and -9 is not clear. However, in the case of pro-MMP-2 it appears that MT-MMPs are important activators in tissues and that tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-2 (TIMP-2) is required for efficient activation in vivo (23Wang Z. Juttermann R. Soloway P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26411-26415Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). Because MCs are often found close to sites where MMP activity is operating, e.g. in wound healing areas and the vicinity of neoplastic tissue, MC chymase would be well suited for an in vivo role in pro-MMP-2 and -9 activation. Indeed, MCs have, in addition to their well established role in immediate hypersensitivity (24Galli S.J. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 186: 343-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), been strongly implicated in various processes in which MMP activity is involved, e.g. angiogenesis (25Norrby K. APMIS. 2002; 110: 355-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar), wound healing (26Trautmann A. Toksoy A. Engelhardt E. Brocker E.B. Gillitzer R. J. Pathol. 2000; 190: 100-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar), arthritis (27Lee D.M. Friend D.S. Gurish M.F. Benoist C. Mathis D. Brenner M.B. Science. 2002; 297: 1689-1692Crossref PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar), and tumor metastasis (28Coussens L.M. Raymond W.W. Bergers G. Laig-Webster M. Behrendtsen O. Werb Z. Caughey G.H. Hanahan D. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1382-1397Crossref PubMed Scopus (808) Google Scholar), but their mechanism of action under these circumstances has not been clarified. The aim of the present investigation was therefore to address the relative importance of MCs and the MC proteases, in particular chymase, in the activation of pro-MMP-2 and -9 in vivo. Mice—Mice deficient in N-deacetylase/N-sulfotransferase 2 (NDST-2; congenic C57BL/6 background) and mouse MC protease 4 (mMCP-4; mixed genetic background C57BL/6-129SVJ; F1 from N2 and F1 from N6 × N7; mice at different stages of back-crossing toward C57BL/6 produced similar results) were generated by gene targeting (6Forsberg E. Pejler G. Ringvall M. Lunderius C. Tomasini-Johansson B. Kusche-Gullberg M. Eriksson I. Ledin J. Hellman L. Kjellen L. Nature. 1999; 400: 773-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar, 29Tchougounova E. Pejler G. Abrink M. J. Exp. Med. 2003; 198: 423-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). In all experiments, age-matched litter mates (12–16 weeks old) were used. Cell Culture and Purification of MCs—Peritoneal cells were collected by peritoneal washing with 10 ml of cold phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4). Cells were centrifuged (300 × g at 4 °C for 10 min) and cultured in serum-free medium, HybridoMed DIF (Biochrom AG, Berlin, Germany), supplemented with 50 μg/ml gentamycin (Invitrogen). The cells were distributed in 24-well plates (∼1.0 × 106 cells in 0.5 ml/well; Nunc). Cells were incubated at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2. Conditioned media were collected at various time points. For the activation of cells, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (final concentration 25 ng/ml) was added. After various times of incubation, conditioned media were collected. MCs of ∼95% purity, as judged by toluidine blue staining (the majority of the contaminating cells were red blood cells), were prepared by density gradient centrifugation on metrizamide. Mononuclear cells (MC-depleted) were recovered from the buffer/metrizamide interphase. Purified mononuclear cells (macrophages and lymphocytes in approximately equal proportions) and MCs were cultured either separately or in co-culture. Zymography—Protein was extracted from homogenized ears, lungs, and hearts in two steps. First, homogenization (using a PT1200 Polytron device; Kinematica AG, Lucerne, Switzerland) of tissues was performed in 1.5 ml of low salt phosphate-buffered saline buffer (pH 7.4) containing 1 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.14 m NaCl and a protease inhibitor mixture (final concentrations were 2.3 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride, 10 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm bestatin, 0.03 mm pepstatin A, and 0.03 mm E-64) (Sigma-Aldrich). Homogenates were centrifuged (13,400 rpm at 4 °C for 20 min), and supernatants were collected. Gelatinase activities in the low salt extracts were negligible, as assessed by gelatin zymography (not shown). Next, the pellets were extracted with 500 μl of a high salt phosphate-buffered saline buffer (pH 7.4) containing 1 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 2 m NaCl, and protease inhibitors as described above. Samples were rotated for 30 min at 4 °C and centrifuged (13,400 rpm at 4 °C for 20 min), and the resulting supernatants were collected for zymography analysis. Zymography was performed with samples normalized for protein concentration after measuring protein content using the Bio-Rad protein assay according to the instructions provided by the manufacturer. The samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE in gels containing 8% polyacrylamide and 1 mg/ml gelatin. After electrophoresis, gels were washed 2 × 10 min with 2% Triton X-100 and 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) followed by 2 × 10 min of washing with 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) and subsequent incubation at 37 °C for 20 h in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 5 mm CaCl2, and 1% Triton X-100. Gels were stained with Coomassie Blue R-250 and destained. The positions of the different forms of MMP-2 and -9 in the zymograms were determined by comparison with the migration of pro and active MMP-2 and -9 present in conditioned medium from HT-1080 cells. Histochemical Analysis—Ears, lungs, and hearts were frozen on dry ice and kept at –70 °C. Organs were mounted with Tissue-Tek (MICROM International, Walldorf, Germany), and cryosections of 7 μm were prepared. For toluidine blue staining, slides were fixed in ethanol for 3 min, stained with 0.1% toluidine blue in 50% ethanol (v/v) (pH 3) for 15 min, and then rinsed with water. In situ zymography was performed by incubating cryosections with 40 μg/ml fluorescein-conjugated gelatin (Molecular Probes, Eugene, Oregon) in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 10 mm CaCl2, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.05% Brij-35 for 10 h at 37 °C. Sections were washed 3 times with H2O and mounted with Vectashield. Gelatinase activity was visualized using fluorescence microscopy. For visualization of collagen content, cryosections (5 μm) were prepared from paraffin-embedded organs and stained with a van Gieson stain (which stains collagen red). Immunohistochemical analysis of fibronectin was likewise performed on cryosections (5 μm) prepared from paraffin-embedded organs using an avidin-biotin complex-based technique (Vectastain Elite ABC Kit; Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). Sections were incubated with a rabbit antiserum toward bovine fibronectin (cross-reacts with mouse fibronectin; gift from Staffan Johansson, Uppsala University) diluted 1:100 in Tris-buffered saline. As a secondary antibody, biotinylated anti-rabbit IgG was used (diluted 1:100 in Tris-buffered saline). Amino Acid Analysis—For determination of amino acid content, wet samples (70–170 mg) were hydrolyzed for 24 h at 100 °C in 5 ml of 6 m HCl containing 5 μmol of norleucine as internal standard. Following hydrolysis, 1-ml aliquots were evaporated to dryness, and the pellets were dissolved in 5 ml of pH 2.2 sample application buffer. 50-μl aliquots were analyzed with a Biotronik LC-5001 amino acid analyzer using the extended physiological program with lithium citrate buffers and ninhydrin detection. Data collection was done with a Shimadzu CR2-AX integrator. The results were normalized on the basis of the weights of sample taken for analysis and the recovery of the internal standard, norleucine. Measurements of ear thickness were carried out with a Oditest device (Kroeplin, Germany) and conducted in a blinded fashion. First we addressed the importance of MCs in the processing of endogenous pro-MMP-9. Mouse peritoneal cell populations, typically composed of ∼2–4% MCs with the remainder being macrophages and lymphocytes in approximately equal proportions, were recovered. MCs were separated from the macrophages/lymphocytes, and the two cell populations were cultured either separately or in co-culture. Culture supernatants were recovered and analyzed for the presence of pro and active MMP-9 by gelatin zymography. From Fig. 1A it is clear that culture supernatants recovered from the MC-depleted peritoneal cell population contained only the pro-form of MMP-9. However, when MCs were added, processing of pro-MMP-9 into its active form was seen, and the degree of pro-MMP-9 activation was dependent on the number of MCs added. These results thus indicate that the processing of pro-MMP-9 into active enzyme is MC-dependent. To determine whether the pro-MMP-9 processing was catalyzed by any of the neutral proteases that are present in the MC secretory granule, we used peritoneal cells recovered from a mouse strain deficient in the gene for N-deacetylase/N-sulfotransferase 2. NDST-2 is an essential enzyme for the biosynthesis of MC heparin, and it was shown previously that the lack of heparin leads to a global reduction in the neutral proteases present in the peritoneal MC secretory granule A (6Forsberg E. Pejler G. Ringvall M. Lunderius C. Tomasini-Johansson B. Kusche-Gullberg M. Eriksson I. Ledin J. Hellman L. Kjellen L. Nature. 1999; 400: 773-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar, 7Humphries D.E. Wong G.W. Friend D.S. Gurish M.F. Qiu W.T. Huang C. Sharpe A.H. Stevens R.L. Nature. 1999; 400: 769-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1B, pro-MMP-9 processing was clearly seen in wild type (WT) peritoneal cells but was undetectable in peritoneal cell populations recovered from NDST-2–/– animals, indeed supporting a central role for the MC neutral proteases in the activation of pro-MMP-9. MMP-2, either in pro or active form, was not clearly visible in conditioned media from peritoneal cells recovered from WT or NDST-2 null animals. To investigate whether MC chymase is of physiological relevance for MMP-2 and -9 activation, we made use of a mouse strain carrying a targeted inactivation of the gene for mMCP-4 (29Tchougounova E. Pejler G. Abrink M. J. Exp. Med. 2003; 198: 423-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). mMCP-4 constitutes the dominating chymotrypsin-like enzyme in connective tissue type MCs and, importantly, mMCP-4 may be the functional counterpart to the only human chymase identified (29Tchougounova E. Pejler G. Abrink M. J. Exp. Med. 2003; 198: 423-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Indeed, only the pro-form of MMP-9 was detected in peritoneal cell culture supernatants from mMCP-4–/– mice, whereas both pro and active MMP-9 was present in supernatants from WT cells (Fig. 2A). To examine the in vivo relevance of these findings, we investigated whether the lack of mMCP-4 caused alterations in the ratio of pro versus active MMP-9 in various tissues. Extracts were prepared from ears, lungs, and hearts and analyzed by gelatin zymography. As is evident from Fig. 2, B–D, only the pro-form of MMP-9 was detected in mMCP-4–/– tissues, whereas both the pro and active forms of MMP-9 were present in WT tissues. Interestingly, the degree of pro-MMP-9 processing in WT tissues appeared to be correlated with the number of MCs present in the respective tissues. Thus, ear tissue, which is rich in connective tissue type MCs, predominantly contained the active form of MMP-9, whereas lung tissue, a tissue with low numbers of MCs, had lower levels of active MMP-9. We also assessed whether mMCP-4 was of importance in the processing of MMP-2. As shown in Fig. 3, both the pro and active forms of MMP-2 were found in the various WT tissues. Both forms of MMP-2 were also detected in mMCP-4–/– tissues. However, the level of active MMP-2 was markedly lower than in WT tissues, indicating that mMCP-4 is important but not essential for the activation of pro-MMP-2 in vivo. The effect of mMCP-4 on gelatinolytic activity was also studied by in situ gelatin zymography. In ear tissue, gelatinolytic activity was observed in the epidermis of both WT and mMCP-4–/– mice (Fig. 4, C and D), possibly due to MMP-9 expression and non-chymase-dependent activation in keratinocytes. In the dermis region, by contrast, strong gelatinolytic activity was found in the WT but not in mMCP-4–/– tissue. In lung tissue of WT mice, strong gelatinolytic activity was found in the vicinity of blood vessels and bronchioli but was essentially absent at the corresponding sites in mMCP-4–/– lung tissue (Fig. 4, A and B). The in situ gelatinolytic activity was completely blocked by EDTA, an inhibitor of metalloprotease activities (not shown), but it was not blocked by Pefabloc SC, a general serine protease inhibitor (not shown). In Fig. 4 it is also shown that MCs, as judged by staining with toluidine blue, are localized to regions in which gelatinolytic activity is present (Fig. 4, E–H). Because MMPs have been implicated in various connective tissue remodeling processes, we next studied whether the lack of mMCP-4 and the consequent reduction in active MMPs caused alterations in connective tissue composition. Analysis using the van Gieson stain showed an enhanced staining in ear tissue from mMCP-4 null animals as compared with controls, indicating an increase in collagen deposition (Fig. 5, A and B), and the increase in staining was accompanied by a significant increase in ear thickness (Fig. 5E). Moreover, amino acid analysis of ear tissue revealed a significant increase in the content of hydroxyproline, an amino acid modification that is specific for collagen, in ear tissue from mMCP-4 null animals (Fig. 5F). In contrast, no significant alterations in the levels of other amino acid residues apart from that of hydroxyproline were seen (not shown). There was also a tendency of increased collagen deposition in the vicinity of bronchioli (Fig. 5, C and D), although there was no significant increase in hydroxyproline content of total lung tissue (not shown). We also stained for fibronectin, another prominent connective tissue component. As can be seen in Fig. 5, G–J, there was a markedly stronger staining for fibronectin in mMCP-4 null lung and ear tissue as compared with control, indicating a higher degree of fibronectin deposition. The data presented here indicate a central role for mMCP-4 in the regulation of MMP-2 and -9 activities. Because mMCP-4 most likely represents the functional homologue to the only human chymase identified (29Tchougounova E. Pejler G. Abrink M. J. Exp. Med. 2003; 198: 423-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), we may propose a similar role for the human chymase in the regulation of the corresponding human MMPs. Although the present data establishes that MMP-9 and -2 activation is strongly chymase-dependent, we cannot with certainty define the mechanism by which this occurs. The most straightforward explanation would be that pro-MMP-9 and pro-MMP-2 are substrates for mMCP-4. Indeed, because several studies have shown that pro-MMP-9 is a substrate for chymase in vitro (21Fang K.C. Raymond W.W. Blount J.L. Caughey G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25628-25635Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 28Coussens L.M. Raymond W.W. Bergers G. Laig-Webster M. Behrendtsen O. Werb Z. Caughey G.H. Hanahan D. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1382-1397Crossref PubMed Scopus (808) Google Scholar), we favor the notion that pro-MMP-9 is also a substrate for mMCP-4 in vivo. It was shown previously that dog α-chymase activates the canine pro-MMP-9 by cleaving the Phe88–Gln89 and Phe91–Glu92 bonds (21Fang K.C. Raymond W.W. Blount J.L. Caughey G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25628-25635Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Cleavage after aromatic side chains is a characteristic feature of chymotrypsin-like enzymes such as the MC chymases. Importantly, the Phe88–Gln89 and Phe91–Glu92 sequences, as well as the amino acid sequences surrounding these sites, are conserved between dog, human, and mouse pro-MMP-9. Hence, we may propose that mMCP-4 is likely to catalyze the corresponding cleavages in murine pro-MMP-9. Interestingly, it is known that pro-MMP-9 activation, e.g. catalyzed by stromeolysin, matrilysin collagenase, and trypsin, can also occur through cleavage of the Arg87–Phe88 bond (30Shapiro S.D. Fliszar C.J. Broekelmann T.J. Mecham R.P. Senior R.M. Welgus H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6351-6356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 31Sang Q.X. Birkedal-Hansen H. Van Wart H.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1251: 99-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Apparently, enzymatic activation can thus be accomplished by cleavage at either of these neighboring sites. In case of pro-MMP-2, a number of studies have shown that activation of the protease is accomplished by cleavage of the Asn80–Tyr81 or Asn82–Phe83 bonds (32Itoh Y. Binner S. Nagase H. Biochem. J. 1995; 308: 645-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 33Crabbe T. O'Connell J.P. Smith B.J. Docherty A.J. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 14419-14425Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 34Chen J.M. Fortunato M. Stevens R.A. Barrett A.J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 382: 777-783Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because cleavage after an Asn residue is not consistent with the chymotrypsin-like substrate specificity carried by the MC chymases, it is not likely that mMCP-4 causes activation of pro-MMP-2 by cleavage of this bond. It is more likely that mMCP-4 cleaves at the Tyr81–Asn82 bond downstream of the Asn80–Tyr81 site, implying that cleavage of this bond also generates active protease. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that mMCP-4-dependent activation of pro-MMP-2 is indirect, i.e. that another protease than mMCP-4 performs the activating cleavage but that this protease, in turn, is dependent on mMCP-4. Clearly, further work will be required to determine the mechanism behind the partial dependence of pro-MMP-2 on mMCP-4 for activation. A plausible explanation for the enhanced levels of connective tissue proteins in the mMCP-4–/– tissues is that MMPs normally control the levels of these components, either directly by proteolysis or indirectly by activating other enzymes that execute proteolytic processes, and that the reduction in the levels of active MMPs thus causes an accumulation of connective tissue proteins. In line with an indirect scenario, it has been shown that MMP-2 can participate in the activation of procollagenase-3 (35Knauper V. Will H. Lopez-Otin C. Smith B. Atkinson S.J. Stanton H. Hembry R.M. Murphy G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17124-17131Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar). However, we cannot exclude MMP-independent effects of mMCP-4 on the connective tissue components. For example, we have shown previously that fibronectin is a substrate for mMCP-4 (36Tchougounova E. Forsberg E. Angelborg G. Kjellén L. Pejler G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3772-3777Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), and it has been shown that MC chymase can degrade type I procollagen (37Kofford M.W. Schwartz L.B. Schechter N.M. Yager D.R. Diegelmann R.F. Graham M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7127-7131Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Furthermore, chymase has been reported to activate human interstitial procollagenase by cleavage of the Leu83–Thr84 bond (38Saarinen J. Kalkkinen N. Welgus H.G. Kovanen P.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18134-18140Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The present data thus indicate a role for MC chymase in maintaining connective tissue homeostasis by regulating, either indirectly or directly, the levels of various connective tissue components. MC chymases have, as noted above, been implicated in a variety of disorders. However, the mechanism of action in vivo has not been determined for any of the MC proteases, i.e. the in vivo substrates for the MC proteases have not been identified. The present report provides, to our knowledge for the first time, information on the molecular level on how any of the MC proteases acts in vivo. Because MMP-2 and -9 have been strongly implicated in similar disorders as those that have been linked to chymase, mMCP-4-mediated activation of pro-MMP-2 and -9 may provide a link between MCs and processes that are regulated by MMPs. Furthermore, we may propose that in therapeutic regimens aiming at the inhibition of MMP activities, an even more effective treatment may include targeting of the MMP activators, e.g. chymase. We are grateful to Eva Hellmén for helpful discussions."
https://openalex.org/W2089633892,"Vascular endothelial cells (EC) are an important target of estrogen action through both the classical genomic (i.e. nuclear-initiated) activities of estrogen receptors alpha and beta (ERalpha and ERbeta) and the rapid non-genomic (i.e. membrane-initiated) activation of ER that stimulates intracellular phosphorylation pathways. We tested the hypothesis that the red wine polyphenol trans-resveratrol activates MAPK signaling via rapid ER activation in bovine aortic EC, human umbilical vein EC, and human microvascular EC. We report that bovine aortic EC, human umbilical vein EC, and human microvascular EC express ERalpha and ERbeta. We demonstrate that resveratrol and estradiol (E(2)) rapidly activated MAPK in a MEK-1, Src, matrix metalloproteinase, and epidermal growth factor receptor-dependent manner. Importantly, resveratrol activated MAPK and endothelial nitric-oxide synthase (eNOS) at nm concentrations (i.e. an order of magnitude less than that required for ER genomic activity) and concentrations possibly achieved transiently in serum following oral red wine consumption. Co-treatment with ER antagonists ICI 182,780 or 4-hydroxytamoxifen blocked resveratrol- or E(2)-induced MAPK and eNOS activation, indicating ER dependence. We demonstrate for the first time that ERalpha-and ERbeta-selective agonists propylpyrazole triol and diarylpropionitrile, respectively, stimulate MAPK and eNOS activity. A red but not a white wine extract also activated MAPK, and activity was directly correlated with the resveratrol concentration. These data suggest that ER may play a role in the rapid effects of resveratrol in EC and that some of the atheroprotective effects of resveratrol may be mediated through rapid activation of ER signaling in EC."
https://openalex.org/W1993168711,"Memapsin 2 (BACE, β-secretase) is a membrane-associated aspartic protease that initiates the hydrolysis of β-amyloid precursor protein (APP) leading to the production of amyloid-β (Aβ) and the progression of Alzheimer disease. Both memapsin 2 and APP are transported from the cell surface to endosomes where APP is cleaved by memapsin 2. We described previously that the cytosolic domain of memapsin 2 contains an acid cluster-dileucine motif (ACDL) that binds the VHS (Vps-27, Hrs, and STAM) domain of Golgi-localized γ-ear-containing ARF-binding (GGA) proteins (He, X., Zhu, G., Koelsch, G., Rodgers, K.

Here we report that GGA proteins colocalize in the trans-Golgi network and endosomes with memapsin 2 and a memapsin 2 chimera containing a cytosolic domain of a mannose-6-phosphate receptor. Depleting cellular GGA proteins with RNA interference or mutation of serine 498 to stop the phosphorylation of ACDL resulted in the accumulation of memapsin 2 in early endosomes. A similar change of memapsin 2 localization also was observed when a retromer subunit, VPS26, was depleted.

After a second cleavage by another protease, γ-secretase, a 40- or 42-residue peptide called amyloid-β (Aβ) is produced. An excessive level of Aβ in the brain facilitates a series of adverse events, including the accumulation of Aβ plaques, brain inflammation, and the death of neurons, and leads to the progression of Alzheimer disease (5Selkoe D. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 741-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (5092) Google Scholar). In view of its pivotal position in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer disease, memapsin 2 is viewed as a promising target for the development of inhibitor drugs to treat Alzheimer disease. In this connection, the understanding of molecular and cellular activity of memapsin 2 presently is of great scientific interest. Memapsin 2 is a type I transmembrane protein with a single transmembrane segment linking a luminal catalytic ectodomain, which is homologous to other mammalian aspartic proteases (6Hong L. Koelsch G. Lin X. Wu S. Terzyan S. Ghosh A. Zhang X.C. Tang J. Science. 2000; 290: 150-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (693) Google Scholar), to a C-terminal cytosolic tail of 21 residues. Newly synthesized pro-memapsin 2 is processed to mature protease by furin during transit through the secretory pathway to the cell surface (7Bennett B.D. Denis P. Haniu R. Teplow D.B. Kahn S.

Memapsin 2 and its substrate APP are both internalized from the cell surface to endosomes where APP is cleaved by memapsin 2 in an acidic medium, leading to the production of Aβ. The memapsin 2 protease then is recycled to the cell surface (10Huse J.T. Pijak D.S. Leslie G.J. Lee V.M.-Y. Doms R.W. J. Biol.

Thus, the cellular trafficking of memapsin 2 is intimately related to the mechanism and regulation of Aβ production. As in the case of many other membrane proteins, the cellular transport of memapsin 2 is mediated by its cytosolic domain (10Huse J.T. Pijak D.S. Leslie G.J. Lee V.M.-Y. Doms R.W. J. Biol.

Recently, the region of memapsin 2 cytosolic domain that mediates cellular trafficking has been traced to a motif with the sequence DISLL. This motif, which belongs to the acidic cluster-dileucine (ACDL) sorting signal (DXXLL, where X denotes a nonconserved residue) (for review, see Ref. 13Bonifacino J.S. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell.

Chem. 2001; 276: 28541-28545Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) as the initial sorting recognition in the transport from trans-Golgi to endosomes. By analogy, the GGA/memapsin 2 interaction is thought to mediate the cellular transport of memapsin 2 (14He X. Chang W.P. Koelsch G. Tang J. FEBS Lett. 2002; 524: 183-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 15He X. Zhu G. Koelsch G. Rodgers K.K. Zhang X.C. Tang J. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 12174-12180Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), although direct cellular evidence and the specific route of involvement have yet to be demonstrated. However, several pieces of evidence argue against the involvement of GGA proteins in the endocytic pathway of memapsin 2. First, GGA proteins are associated with trans-Golgi and endosomes but scarcely at the cellular plasma membrane (19Boman A.L. Zhang C. Zhu X. Kahn R.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 1241-1255Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar, 20Hirst J. Lui W.W. Bright N.A. Totty N. Seamen M.N. Robinson M.S. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 67-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). Second, memapsin 2 ectodomain devoid of GGA binding motif is internalized by cells through the interaction with APP (21Huang X.P. Chang W.P. Koelsch G. Turner III, R. Lupu F. Tang J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 37886-37894Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), suggesting that the ACDL motif of memapsin 2 is not essential for its endocytosis. Third, the native ACDL motif of memapsin 2 interacts approximately 20 times weaker than the corresponding interaction with mannose-6-phosphate receptors. The phosphorylation of Ser498 in the ACDL motif of memapsin 2 enhances GGA binding to the intensity similar to that for MPR proteins (15He X. Zhu G. Koelsch G. Rodgers K.K. Zhang X.C. Tang J. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 12174-12180Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of the memapsin 2 ACDL motif is essential for its recycling pathway from early endosomes to the cell surface (11Walter J. Fluhrer R. Hartung B. Willem M. Kaether C. Capell A. Lammich S. Multhaup G. Haass C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14634-14641Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). These observations open the possibility that the interaction of GGA proteins with the phosphorylated memapsin 2 may mediate the recycling of the protease from endosomes back to the cell surface. To further understand the involvement of GGA proteins in intracellular transport of memapsin 2, we studied the cellular trafficking of memapsin 2 and its chimera with MPR cytosolic domain. We report in this paper that GGA proteins are involved in the cellular transport of memapsin 2 from endosomes to the cell surface in the recycle pathway. cDNA Vectors—The constructs of expression vectors of human wild-type memapsin 2 and Swedish mutant of APP cDNAs were described previously (1Lin X.

The ratio of pSuper/RNAi plasmid DNA to pSectag was 4:1. 56 h after transfection, the cells were harvested for double-labeled immunofluorescence to detect colocalization of memapsin 2 with different organelle markers. siRNA knockdown of VPS26 was performed as described by Senman (23Senman M.N.J. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 165: 111-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar). siRNA oligonucleotides used to knock down VPS26 expression (AAUGAUGGGGAAACCAGGAAA) and control lamin A/C siRNA were obtained from Dharmacon. HeLa cells were cultured as described above in six-well dishes until ∼60–70% confluency. At least 4 h after seeding the cells, the first transfection was performed using Oligofectamine (Invitrogen). The cells were trypsinized the following day. Two transfections were performed, one at the start of the experiment and the other after 2 days. The cells were trypsinized 24 h after second transfection and were plated onto coverslips of six-well dishes for memapsin 2 transient overexpression and confocal microscopy observation. Immunofluorescence Labeling of Cultured Cells—HeLa cells were seeded onto six-well plates with glasses coverslips and expressed the memapsin 2 or mutant constructs for 56 h after transfection. Cells were gently fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, at room temperature for 15 min. Following fixation, coverslips were washed twice for 10 min in PBS and incubated for 1 h at room temperature with the indicated combinations of primary antibodies diluted in 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 0.1% saponin, and 0.02% sodium azide in PBS (immunofluorescence buffer). At the end of this period, coverslips were washed twice with PBS followed by incubation for 30 min with the indicated combinations of secondary antibodies diluted in immunofluorescence buffer. Following incubation, coverslips were washed again twice with PBS and mounted on slides using Vectorshield (Vector Laboratories, Inc., Burlingame, CA). Images were obtained in an inverted confocal laser-scanning microscope (LSM 510, Carl Zeiss Inc.). Human neuroblastoma M17 Cells (ATCC) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C in the presence of 5% CO2. M17 cells were seeded onto six-well plates with glass coverslips. Endogenous memapsin 2 and GGA1 were observed as above. Transient Transfection and Immunoprecipitation/Western Blotting—Plasmids containing separately memapsin 2 or its mutants and APPsw cDNAs were transiently transfected into HEK-293 cells in six-well plates using transfection reagent Lipofectamine 2000. Cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (GibcoBUR). After transfection, cells were changed to fresh medium (1.5 ml for a six-well plate) conditioned for 48 h, subjected to immunoprecipitation and Western blotting. Aβ peptides secreted into medium were immunoprecipitated at 4 °C overnight with monoclonal antibody mAb1560 (1:800) and protein G plus A-agarose (Sigma). Immunoprecipitates were washed for 20 min at 4 °C with lysis buffer (PBS with 1% Nonidet P-40 with protease inhibitors) and then washed in lysis buffer containing 0.1% SDS. The samples were washed again in lysis buffer, eluted in Laemmli sample buffer, separated by SDS-PAGE on 10–20% Tris-Tricine gels (Invitrogen), and transferred to PVDF membrane. The membrane was blotted with the same antibody and detected with ECL (Amersham Biosciences). Immunoelectrophoresis of APP and Fragments—After transfection, HEK-293 cells were solubilized in lysis buffer as described above and centrifuged at maximum speed in an Eppendorf centrifuge for 10 min to remove cellular debris. The samples were mixed with Laemmli buffer, resolved by SDS-PAGE on 10–20% Tris-Tricine gels, transferred to PVDF membrane, and immunoblotted with antibody 5352. Subcellular Localization of Memapsin 2 and Mutants—We compared the intracellular distribution of wild-type memapsin 2 with that of two memapsin 2 mutants. One was a chimera, M2-MPR, in which the memapsin 2 cytosolic domain was replaced by the cytosolic domain of CD-MPR (Fig. 1A) that also contained an ACDL motif. Because GGA proteins (Fig. 1B) are known to be involved in the transport and retrieval between trans-Golgi and the early endosome (16Puertollano R. Aguilar R.C. Gorshkova I. Crouch R.J.

In the second mutant, M2-Leu/Ala, two leucines in the ACDL motif of memapsin 2 were replaced by alanines (Fig. 1A), resulting in a mutant defective in endocytosis (10Huse J.T. Pijak D.S. Leslie G.J.

Little memapsin 2 is seen on the cell surface. The colocalization of memapsin 2 with TGN and early endosome markers was confirmed by separate immunochemical staining with TGN38 (TGN marker) and EEA1 (results not shown). Immunolabeling pattern for cells expressing M2-MPR, which showed a similar perinuclear distribution as well as peripheral labeling (Fig. 1D), also colocalized well with TGN and early endosome markers (data not shown). The cellular distribution pattern of this chimera is similar to that of CD-MPR itself, which was found most abundantly in TGN, less in endosomes, and little on the cell surface (25Mathews P.M.

M2-Leu/Ala mutant showed a predominant localization on the cell surface (Fig. 1E) as reported previously (10Huse J.T. Pijak D.S. Leslie G.J. Lee V.M.-Y. Doms R.W. J. Biol.

The chimera of memapsin 2 with the cytosolic domain of CD-MPR also had an intracellular distribution similar to that of CD-MPR. Memapsin 2 and GGA Proteins Colocalize in the Cell—Wildtype memapsin 2 and individual GGA proteins expressed in HeLa cells were examined using immunofluorescent staining and confocal microscopy. The distribution of GGA proteins in the cells was similar to that previously reported (19Boman A.L. Zhang C. Zhu X. Kahn R.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 1241-1255Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar, 20Hirst J. Lui W.W. Bright N.A. Totty N. Seamen M.N. Robinson M.S. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 67-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). Extensive colocalization was seen for the wild-type memapsin 2 with each of the three GGA proteins in the perinuclear region, and some but much less extensive colocalization was observed in the peripheral structure (Fig. 2). Similar experiments were also performed on neuroblastoma M17 cells with the same results (Fig. 2, J–L). M2-MPR chimera also colocalized with each of the three GGA proteins with the distribution patterns similar to those observed for the wild-type memapsin 2 (Fig. 3). These observations suggest that MPR cytosolic domain in the chimera interacted with GGA proteins and directed the transport of M2-MPR to endosomes. However, memapsin 2 mutant M2-Leu/Ala was mainly present on the cell surface and did not significantly colocalize with any of the GGA proteins (Fig. 4). Very weak colocalization seen for GGA2 and GGA3 in the merged images may have resulted from residual interaction between M2-Leu/Ala and these two GGA proteins. These observations are consistent with the idea that all three GGA proteins function in the cellular transport of memapsin 2 in a manner similar to the transport of MPR (22Ghosh P. Griffith J. Geuze H.J. Kornfeld S. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 163: 755-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar).Fig. 3Cellular localization of chimera M2-MPR and GGA proteins.

Each of the three GGA proteins, but not the control protein, β-actin, was greatly diminished by the transfection of specific GGA siRNA vectors (Fig. 5). In mock-treated cells, the bulk of the wild-type memapsin 2 (Fig. 6B) and the memapsin 2-MPR chimera (Fig. 7B) was found in the juxtanuclear area as seen in the preceding figures. Silencing each GGA proteins significantly increased the presence in the peripheral region of the cells and decreased at approximately the same level the juxtanuclear localization for both M2-WT (Fig. 6, E, H, and K) and M2-MPR (Fig. 7, E, H, and K). These changes are similar to those observed for cation-independent MPR (CI-MPR) when GGA proteins were individually depleted (22Ghosh P. Griffith J. Geuze H.J. Kornfeld S. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 163: 755-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar).Fig. 6Depletion of GGAs 1, 2, and 3 affects the localization of memapsin 2-WT.

Significantly, the EEA1 colocalization with peripheral memapsin 2 was substantially increased with GGA depletion, suggesting an increase of memapsin 2 in endosomes. In contrast, M2-Leu/Ala in HeLa cells exhibited no significant change from predominant cell surface localization upon the depletion of GGA proteins (data not shown). These observations suggest that all three GGA proteins participate in intracellular trafficking of native memapsin 2 and the M2-MPR chimera. Change in Memapsin 2 Intracellular Distribution upon Mutation of Ser498 to Ala—We previously demonstrated that phosphorylation of Ser498 of memapsin2 within the ACDL motif increased the binding affinity of memapsin 2 for the VHS domain of GGA proteins (15He X. Zhu G. Koelsch G. Rodgers K.K. Zhang X.C. Tang J. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 12174-12180Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). It was of interest then to determine whether the phosphorylated memapsin 2 ACDL was involved in the intracellular trafficking of the protease. We mutated Ser498 to an alanine to preclude phosphorylation at this position and compared the localization in cells expressing the wild-type and mutant memapsin 2. Immunofluorescence microscopy study showed that the mutation of Ser498 changed the distribution of memapsin 2 from perinuclear (Fig. 8, upper panels) to the peripheral localization (Fig. 8, lower panels). Consequently, the colocalization of the endosome marker EEA1 and the mutant M2-Ser/Ala was observed in the peripheral region but was not predominantly in the perinuclear region as seen for the wild-type memapsin 2. These observations are reminiscent of the changes found for GGA depletion discussed above and suggest that both GGA depletion and Ser498 mutation may block the same retrieval pathway for memapsin 2 from endosomes back to the cell surface. Change of Memapsin 2 Intracellular Distribution in siRNA-mediated VPS26 Knockdown—The retrieval of MPR from endosomes back to Golgi has been shown to involve an intracellular protein complex called retromer (23Senman M.N.J. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 165: 111-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar). siRNA-mediated depletion of VPS26, a component protein of retromer, blocked the transport of CI-MPRs retrieval from endosome to Golgi. Because memapsin 2 and MPR both utilize ACDL/GGA interaction in cellular trafficking, it seemed possible that, in its recycling pathway, memapsin 2 is transported from endosomes to Golgi as an intermediate compartment before memapsin 2 reaches the cell surface. Therefore, we asked whether the depletion of VPS26 influenced the recycling of memapsin 2 from endosomes. siRNA-mediated depletion of VPS26 was nearly complete and did not affect the level of a control siRNA vector for β-actin (Fig. 9A). Images from immunochemical staining showed that the intracellular localization of memapsin 2 changed from a predominantly perinuclear localization with VPS26 expression (Fig. 9, B–D) to a peripheral localization (Fig. 9, E–G) upon VPS26 depletion. Some of the memapsin 2 was also found to be present at the plasma membrane. This may have resulted from the backup of the trafficking due to serious disruption of endosome to Golgi transport. However, in general, the similarity in intracellular distribution changes with VPS26 depletion, GGA depletion, or Ser498 mutation is striking. Such a comparison, together with the known role of the retromer in MPR retrieval, suggests that memapsin 2 recycles from endosomes by way of the Golgi network. APP Hydrolysis and Aβ Production Mediated by Memapsin 2 Mutants—Because alterations in memapsin 2 distribution and trafficking were observed in the experiments described above, it was of interest to assess the effect of these changes on APP hydrolysis by memapsin 2. Therefore, we compared the memapsin 2-generated APP C-terminal fragment C99 in HEK-293 cells cotransfected with APPsw and each of the following: M2-WT; M2-MPR; M2-Leu/Ala, and M2-Ser/Ala. 48 h after transfection, the expression of memapsin 2 and APP was confirmed by Western blots (Fig. 10, A and B). Chimera M2-MPR and mutants M2-Leu/Ala and M2-Ser/Ala each produced APP fragment C99 (Fig. 10C) and Aβ (Fig. 10D) at a comparable level as that produced by the wild-type memapsin 2. The immunoprecipitated soluble APP fragment resulting from β-secretase cleavage was seen in M2-WT as well as in M2-MPR, M2-Leu/Ala, and M2-Ser/Ala experiments (data not shown). These observations suggest that both memapsin 2 mutants hydrolyzed APP intracellularly to generate Aβ. Evidence reported in this study and previous reports quoted herein suggest an intracellular transport route of memapsin 2 as shown schematically in Fig. 11. Cell surface memapsin 2 and APP were internalized to endosomes where the hydrolysis of APP and the production of Aβ took place. The ACDL motif in the cytosolic domain of memapsin 2 was presumably phosphorylated and interacted with GGA proteins to facilitate its transport from endosomes via TGN to cell surface. We previously demonstrated the interaction between GGA proteins and the native and phosphorylated ACDL motif in the cytosolic domain of memapsin 2 (14He X. Chang W.P. Koelsch G. Tang J. FEBS Lett. 2002; 524: 183-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 15He X. Zhu G. Koelsch G. Rodgers K.K. Zhang X.C. Tang J. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 12174-12180Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). These observations and the knowledge that a similar interaction of GGA proteins with MPR mediates the transport of MPR between the trans-Golgi and endosomes prompted the suggestion that GGA proteins were involved in the intracellular transport of memapsin 2. However, the supporting cellular studies had not been carried out and the specific point of GGA involvement in memapsin 2 trafficking was unknown. GGA proteins are found predominantly in the TGN but are also present in early endosomes (19Boman A.L. Zhang C. Zhu X. Kahn R.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 1241-1255Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar, 20Hirst J. Lui W.W. Bright N.A. Totty N. Seamen M.N. Robinson M.S. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 67-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). We observed cellular colocalization of GGA proteins with memapsin 2 and alteration of the memapsin 2 intracellular locations upon siRNA-mediated GGA depletion. These observations support the contention that GGA proteins are involved in the cellular transport of memapsin 2. As observed in MPR transport (22Ghosh P. Griffith J. Geuze H.J. Kornfeld S. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 163: 755-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), all three GGA proteins are involved in the intracellular trafficking of memapsin 2 because the depletion of any of the three GGA proteins caused a significant redistribution of memapsin 2. In the transport of CI-MPR, three GGA proteins are interdependent in their functions (22Ghosh P. Griffith J. Geuze H.J. Kornfeld S. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 163: 755-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Although we did not provide evidence for this aspect in memapsin 2 transport, it seems probable that the mechanism of involvement of GGA in the transport of the two MPRs and memapsin 2 is the same, namely the recognition of the ACDL motif facilitates packaging the proteins into the transporting vesicles. Our results also support the contention that GGA proteins interact with the phosphorylated ACDL motif of memapsin 2 in the recycling pathway from endosomes to TGN. It is also interesting that the ACDL mutated to preclude phosphorylation resulted in a redistribution of cellular memapsin 2 similarly as observed upon depletion of GGA proteins. This similarity suggests that the peripherally localized memapsin 2 resulting from blockage is achieved by siRNA or by mutation of ACDL. The similarity of the redistribution of memapsin 2 and CI-MPR affected by siRNA for GGA proteins is also striking. The routes for memapsin 2 and CI-MPR to reach endosomes are presumably different. CI-MPR is predominantly transported to the endosome from the Golgi, and memapsin 2 is known to be endocytosed to endosomes from cell surface. The similarity can be explained from the GGA involvement in the recycling pathway of both proteins, i.e. the depletion of GGA would result in the accumulation of both proteins in endosomes. In its recycling pathway, memapsin 2 is probably transported from endosomes to TGN as an intermediate stop before returning to cell surface by the usual secretory pathway. Recent evidence suggests that retromer protein complex is specifically involved in the endosome to TGN transport of MPR (23Senman M.N.J. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 165: 111-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar). Depletion of VPS26, a subunit of retromer complex, caused the redistribution of memapsin 2 from predominantly perinuclear to peripherally localized endosomes. These observations are consistent with the contention that the loss of retromer functions blocks the trafficking from endosomes to TGN and thus causes accumulation of memapsin 2 in the endosomes. However, we did observe the accumulation of memapsin 2 at the cell surface upon retromer depletion. It is not clear whether this is due to the backup of the memapsin 2 traffic or the involvement of retromer in other trafficking routes of memapsin 2. Whichever is the cause, the complication does not appear to change the main conclusion that memapsin 2 recycles through TGN. The overall evidence discussed above is consistent with the notion that phosphorylated memapsin 2 is recycled via TGN on its way back to cell surface. However, identification of specific subcellular compartments along this recycling route would require detailed studies in the future. Current evidence does not support the involvement of GGA proteins in the endocytosis of memapsin 2. We did not observe significant colocalization of GGA and memapsin 2 at the cell surface (Fig. 2). The depletion of GGA proteins did not cause a significant accumulation of memapsin 2 on cell surface (Fig. 6). Because the cytosolic GGA proteins should be accessible for memapsin 2 located both in endosomes and at cell surface, the specificity of recycling involvement may be determined by the phosphorylation of the memapsin 2 ACDL motif. We have shown that the phosphorylated memapsin 2 ACDL binds GGA proteins with ∼20 times lower Kd than the non-phosphorylated ACDL. This tighter binding may be sufficient to provide specificity for the memapsin 2/GGA interaction. If such a mechanism was operative, it would predict the presence of a memapsin 2 ACDL kinase in the endosomes and a phosphatase in the TGN or beyond. The above discussion raises another interesting question regarding the identity of the endocytic signal for memapsin 2 endocytosis. We have confirmed the previous report (10Huse J.T. Pijak D.S. Leslie G.J. Lee V.M.-Y. Doms R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33729-33737Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar, 12Pastorino L. Ikin A.F. Narin A.C. Pursnani A. Buxbaum J.D. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2002; 19: 175-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) that two leucines within the ACDL motif appear to be essential for memapsin 2 endocytosis, because the replacement of these residues with alanines resulted in the accumulation of the mutant protease on cell surface (Fig. 4). Dileucine is a well established endocytotic signal (26Bonifacino J.S. Traub L.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2003; 72: 395-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (1620) Google Scholar), and in this case, it appears to function independent of the GGA/ACDL interaction. Another possible internalization route is the APP-dependent endocytosis. We reported recently (21Huang X.P. Chang W.P. Koelsch G. Turner III, R. Lupu F. Tang J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 37886-37894Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) that the exogenously added memapsin 2 ectodomain is endocytosed by way of an interaction with APP. This process is dependent on the endocytic signal GYENPTY in the cytosolic domain of APP. Full-length memapsin 2 appears to also interact with APP, suggesting that the APP-dependent endocytosis of memapsin 2 may be a viable pathway. In all of the experiments describe herein, M2-MPR chimera responded to all different challenges in almost the same way as the native memapsin 2. Superficially, this suggests that the cytosolic domain of MPR may contain the same targeting information as memapsin 2. The comparison of the two in the current studies was restricted to the recycling pathway that the two native proteins share. However, the pathway leading to endosomes should be different for these two proteins, although it is known that a small fraction of MPR is endocytosed from cell surface. We observed that all of the memapsin 2 constructs, including M2-MPR chimera, produced Aβ and the C99, the C-terminal fragment of APP (Fig. 10). However, the subcellular locales where the cleavage takes place are difficult to dissect. Although the main subcellular site for the generation of Aβ is endosomes, the production of a significant amount of Aβ in the secretory pathway has been documented (27Citron M. Taplow D.B. Selkoe D.J. Neuron. 1995; 14: 661-670Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 28Huse J.T. Liu K. Pijak D.S. Carlin D. Lee V.M. Doms R.W. J. Biol.

Neurochem. 2002; 80: 1019-1028Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). In the case of the dileucine to alanine mutant of memapsin 2 (M2-Leu/Ala in Fig. 10), the Aβ generated should predominantly come from the secretory pathway because this mutant is devoid of endocytic ability. In the case of memapsin 2-MPR chimera (M2-CD in Fig. 10), the presence of C83 (Fig. 10), an APP fragment from the cleavage by cell surface α-secretase, suggests that M2-MPR chimera is capable of reaching cell surface and experiences endocytosis. However, the robust production of Aβ by the chimera raises another interesting question on whether the chimera is transported directly from Golgi to endosomes where the bulk of Aβ is generated. The absence of a C89 band for the non-phosphorylated M2-Ser/Ala mutant (Fig. 10) is consistent with the predominant endosomal localization of this memapsin 2 mutant, and perhaps the cell surface exposure of this protein is a transient one.

All of the compounds were derived from the benzothiazole compound thioflavin T and include 2-[4′-(methylamino)phenyl]benzothiazole and 2-(4′-dimethylamino-)phenyl-imidazo[1,2-a]-pyridine derivatives, 2-[4′-(dimethylamino)phenyl]-6-iodobenzothiazole and 2-[4′-(4″-methylpiperazin-1-yl)phenyl]-6-iodobenzothiazole, and a benzofuran compound (5-bromo-2-(4-dimethylaminophenyl)benzofuran). By using a range of fluorescent and radioligand binding assays, we find that these compounds display a more complex binding pattern than described previously and are consistent with three classes of binding sites on the Aβ fibrils. All of the compounds bound with very high affinity (low nmKd) to a low capacity site (BS3) (1 ligand-binding site per ∼300 Aβ-(1–40) monomers) consistent with the previously recognized binding site for these compounds on the fibrils. However, the compounds also bound with high affinity (Kd ∼100 nm) to either one of two additional binding sites on the Aβ-(1–40) polymer. The properties of these sites, BS1 and BS2, suggest they are adjacent or partially overlapping and have a higher capacity than BS3, occurring every ∼35 or every ∼4 monomers of Aβ-(1–40)-peptide, respectively. Compounds appear to display selectivity for BS2 based on the presence of a halogen substitution (2-[4′-(dimethylamino)phenyl]-6-iodobenzothiazole, 2-[4′-(4″-methylpiperazin-1-yl)phenyl]-6-iodobenzothiazole, and 5-bromo-2-(4-dimethylaminophenyl)benzofuran) on their aromatic ring system. The presence of additional ligand-binding sites presents potential new targets for ligand development and may allow a more complete modeling of the current positron emission tomography data.

Central to the neuropathology of AD is the deposition in specific brain regions of polymeric peptide/protein deposits, composed of β-amyloid peptide (Aβ) and tau protein, termed senile plaques (SPs) and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), respectively (reviewed in Ref. 1Vickers J.C. Dickson T.C. Adlard P.A. Saunders H.L. King C.E. McCormack G. Prog. Neurobiol. 2000; 60: 139-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar).The precise role of these deposits in the pathogenesis of AD is still unclear. However, individuals with mutations leading to increased Aβ production are at a high risk of developing AD (2Selkoe D.J. Schenk D. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2003; 43: 545-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (737) Google Scholar), and individuals with mutations in the tau gene are linked to a class of neurodegenerative diseases including frontotemporal dementia and parkinsonism linked to chromosome 17 (3Tolnay M. Probst A. IUBMB. Life. 2003; 55: 299-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Moreover, the accumulation of SPs and NFTs follows a predictable temporal and spatial sequence in individuals affected with AD (4Braak H. Braak E. Acta Neuropathol. 1991; 82: 239-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (11327) Google Scholar, 5Gold G. Kovari E. Corte G. Herrmann F.R. Canuto A. Bussiere T. Hof P.R. Bouras C. Giannakopoulos P. J. Neuropathol. Exp. Neurol. 2001; 60: 946-952Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Detection of these deposits may therefore provide a clinically useful tool for monitoring disease progression and treatment effects. Positron emission tomography (PET) uses positron emitting radioligands to image and measure ligand-binding sites in vivo and is currently being developed as a sensitive way to track SPs and NFTs in patients (reviewed in Ref. 6Nordberg A. Lancet Neurol. 2004; 3: 519-527Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar).Three broad categories of PET ligands of AD-associated polymers are currently under investigation. One class is derived from the dye thioflavin T (Thio T) and includes BTA/PIB (7Klunk W.E. Wang Y. Huang G.F. Debnath M.L. Holt D.P. Mathis C.A.

Am. Chem. Soc. 2001; 123: 12740-12741Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). The final class has an aminonaphthyl core and includes FENE and FDDNP (14Agdeppa E.D. Kepe V. Liu J. Flores-Torres S. Satyamurthy N. Petric A. Cole G.M. Small G.W. Huang S.C. Barrio J.R. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 189Crossref Google Scholar).The binding of these compounds to Aβ-(1–40) fibrils generated in vitro has been investigated in a number of laboratories, and the results of these studies so far are consistent with three independent binding sites, one for each structural class of ligand, and all with high binding affinities. However, the binding stoichiometry for all these structural classes of ligand has been reported to be low, with ligand-binding sites occurring only every few hundreds (8Mathis C.A. Wang Y. Holt D.P. Huang G.F. Debnath M.L. Klunk W.E. J. Med. Chem. 2003; 46: 2740-2754Crossref PubMed Scopus (846) Google Scholar) or even thousands (14Agdeppa E.D. Kepe V. Liu J. Flores-Torres S. Satyamurthy N. Petric A. Cole G.M. Small G.W. Huang S.C. Barrio J.R. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 189Crossref Google Scholar) of Aβ-(1–40) monomers, and this raises a question of whether the signal to be anticipated from further development of these radioligands will be clinically useful.Two of the ligands 6-OH-BTA-1/PIB and FDDNP have so far progressed to in vivo imaging studies (15Klunk W.E. Engler H. Nordberg A. Wang Y. Blomqvist G. Holt D.P. Bergstrom M. Savitcheva I. Huang G.F. Estrada S. Ausen B. Debnath M.L. Barletta J. Price J.C. Sandell J. Lopresti B.J. Wall A. Koivisto P.

Neurosci. 2002; 19: 323-327Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), comparing small numbers of control and AD patients. The results demonstrate increased retention of labeled species in areas of the brain thought to be affected by AD. However, the precise nature of the signal in these studies remains uncertain given the low density of ligand-binding sites apparently present on Aβ fibrils. The situation is further complicated by ex vivo measurement of PIB binding to brain homogenates obtained post-mortem from patients with AD (8Mathis C.A. Wang Y. Holt D.P. Huang G.F. Debnath M.L. Klunk W.E. J. Med. Chem. 2003; 46: 2740-2754Crossref PubMed Scopus (846) Google Scholar). Aβ peptides were not measured in this study but were interpolated from a different study by Näslund et al. (17Naslund J. Haroutunian V. Mohs R. Davis K.L. Davies P. Greengard P. Buxbaum J.D. J. Am. Med. Assoc. 2000; 283: 1571-1577Crossref PubMed Scopus (1102) Google Scholar). The conclusion was a binding stoichiometry approaching 1:1, much higher than all reports based on the direct study of Aβ fibrils in vitro (8Mathis C.A. Wang Y. Holt D.P. Huang G.F. Debnath M.L. Klunk W.E. J. Med. Chem. 2003; 46: 2740-2754Crossref PubMed Scopus (846) Google Scholar).The binding properties of the ligands to Aβ fibrils have all been characterized by using essentially identical filter binding assays employing either narrow ranges of radioligand to determine Kd values (10Zhuang Z.P. Kung M.P. Hou C. Skovronsky D.M. Gur T.L. Plossl K. Trojanowski J.Q. Lee V.M. Kung H.F. J. Med. Chem. 2001; 44: 1905-1914Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 13Kung H.F. Lee C.W. Zhuang Z.P.

Soc. 2001; 123: 12740-12741Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar) or a single fixed low concentration of radioligand and varying concentrations of cold competitor (7Klunk W.E. Wang Y. Huang G.F. Debnath M.L. Holt D.P. Mathis C.A. Life Sci. 2001; 69: 1471-1484Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar, 18Kung H.F. Kung M.P. Zhuang Z.P. Hou C. Lee C.W. Plossl K. Zhuang B. Skovronsky D.M. Lee V.M. Trojanowski J.Q. Mol. Imaging Biol. 2003; 5: 418-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The former assay format will only generally detect very high affinity binding as lower affinity interactions dissociate during the filter washing step, whereas the latter format is a site-specific assay and will not be sensitive to novel ligand-binding sites. The results of these assays have not yet been confirmed by other ligand-binding techniques.We have addressed these issues by developing a series of homogeneous binding assays that take advantage of the intrinsic fluorescence of both Thio T and a number of representative derivative compounds to measure their binding properties over a wide range of ligand and Aβ fibril concentrations. The results of these assays were compared with classical radioligand binding assays and are consistent with the presence of the previously described low density ligand-binding site but also demonstrate the presence of additional higher density ligand-binding sites on the fibrils. The selectivity of these additional sites and their potential significance for the innovation of selective PET radioligands for the clinical investigation of AD and its treatments are discussed.MATERIALS AND METHODSCompound Names and Sources—The structures of the compounds employed in this study are shown in Fig. 1 and are as follows: thioflavin T (Thio T); 2-[4′-(methylamino)phenyl]benzothiazole (BTA-1) (19Mathis C.A. Bacskai B.J. Kajdasz S.T. McLellan M.E. Frosch M.P. Hyman B.T. Holt D.P. Wang Y. Huang G.F. Debnath M.L. Klunk W.E. Bioorg. Med. Chem.

Brain Res. 2002; 956: 202-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar); 2-[4′-(dimethylamino)phenyl]-6-iodobenzothiazole (TZDM) (10Zhuang Z.P. Kung M.P. Hou C. Skovronsky D.M. Gur T.L. Plossl K. Trojanowski J.Q. Lee V.M. Kung H.F. J. Med. Chem. 2001; 44: 1905-1914Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar); 2-[4′-(4″-methylpiperazin-1-yl)phenyl]-6-iodobenzothiazole (TZPI) (10Zhuang Z.P. Kung M.P. Hou C. Skovronsky D.M. Gur T.L. Plossl K. Trojanowski J.Q. Lee V.M. Kung H.F. J. Med. Chem. 2001; 44: 1905-1914Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar); and 5-bromo-2-(4-dimethylaminophenyl)benzofuran (BF1) (20Ono M. Kung M.P. Hou C. Kung H.F. Nucl. Med. Biol. 2002; 29: 633-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Thio T was obtained from Merck. The remainder of the compounds was custom-synthesized and confirmed for purity by reverse-phase high pressure liquid chromatography, one-dimensional NMR, and mass spectrometer analysis. Radiolabeled 2-[4′-([3H]methylamino)phenyl]-6-methylbenzothiazole ([3H]Me-BTA-1) (84 Ci/mmol, 1 mCi/ml) was custom-synthesized by Amersham Biosciences. All other chemicals were from Sigma with the exceptions of Congo Red and phosphotungstic acid that were obtained from Gee Lawson (London, UK) and Agar Scientific (Stansted, UK).Preparation of Aβ-(1–40) Fibrils—Human Aβ-(1–40)-peptide (Batch number MK0611 from California Peptide Research, Napa, CA) was incubated at 0.5 mg/ml in PB buffer (10 mm sodium phosphate, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.4) at 37 °C for 48 h in an orbital shaker at 200 rpm. The formation of fibrils was confirmed by Congo Red binding (21Nilsson M.R. Methods (Orlando). 2004; 34: 151-160Google Scholar) and Thio T binding (21Nilsson M.R. Methods (Orlando). 2004; 34: 151-160Google Scholar) together with analysis by negative stain electron microscopy using 1% phosphotungstic acid. Fibrils were used immediately upon production or aliquoted and stored at –80 °C. No difference in ligand binding behavior was observed between freshly prepared and frozen material as noted also by others (7Klunk W.E. Wang Y. Huang G.F. Debnath M.L. Holt D.P. Mathis C.A. Life Sci. 2001; 69: 1471-1484Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar).Compound Preparation—All compounds were prepared as 1–10 mm Me2SO stocks before dilution into assay buffer. The maximum final concentration of Me2SO in the assays was 0.5%. Because of the relatively low solubility of the ligands (with the exception of Thio T) in aqueous solution, all assays were performed in PB supplemented with 10% ethanol (PBE) and at a maximum concentration of 5 μm compound.Intrinsic Fluorescence Binding Assays—Intrinsic fluorescence intensity (FLINT) changes associated with ligand binding to Aβ-(1–40) were recorded in a Ultra Evolution 384 plate reader (Tecan, Reading, UK) using a 340–440-nm filter pair. For assays measuring the binding of Thio T, a 450–505-nm filter pair was used. Two formats were used for the FLINT assays. FLINT1 was performed using a fixed concentration of ligand (50 or 100 nm) and varying concentrations of Aβ-(1–40) polymer. FLINT2 was performed using a fixed concentration of Aβ-(1–40) (500 nm) and varying concentrations of ligand (0 to 2 μm) as detailed under “Results.”Fluorescence polarization measurements were recorded in a Ultra Evolution 384 plate reader using a 360-nm polarizing excitation filter and 440-nm emission filters. The assays employed a fixed concentration of BTA-1 (50 nm) and varying concentrations of Aβ-(1–40) (0–50 μm).All fluorescent assays were performed in PBE in a final volume of 80 μl and were incubated for 2 h at 20 °C before reading. All data points were performed at least in quadruplicate and were analyzed using Grafit (Erithacus Software Limited, Horley, UK) to obtain Kd values using the single site ligand-binding module.Fluorescence Competition Assays (FLINT3)—Competition assays employed a fixed concentration of Aβ-(1–40) (2 μm) and Thio T (1 μm) and used varying concentration ranges of competitor ligands (up to 4 μm). Reactions were performed in PBE in a final volume of 80 μl and were incubated for 2 h at 20 °C before measurement in a Ultra Evolution 384 plate reader using a 450–505-nm filter pair. All data points were performed in quadruplicate, and the fluorescent signal in the absence of competitor defined a fractional binding of 1. Data were analyzed using Grafit to obtain IC50 values using full 4-parameter curve fits. Ki values were derived from the Cheng-Prusoff equation (22Cheng Y. Prusoff W.H. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1973; 22: 3099-3108Crossref PubMed Scopus (12187) Google Scholar), Ki = IC50/(1 + ([L]/Kd)) were [L] was the concentration (1000 nm) and Kd (750 nm) of Thio T used in the assay.Fluorescence Energy Transfer (FRET) Measurements—FRET assays employed fixed concentrations of Aβ-(1–40) (2 μm) and Thio T (1 μm) and either 100 nm BF1 or 100 nm BTA-1 in PBE. Measurements were performed in a RF-5301PC spectrofluorimeter (Shimadzu Europa, Milton Keynes, UK) running Hyper RF software. Emission spectra (400–550 nm) were collected following excitation at 340 nm using excitation and emission slit widths of 5 and 1.5 nm, respectively.Radioligand Binding Assays—A fixed concentration of Aβ-(1–40) (40 nm) was titrated against a range of [3H]Me-BTA-1 concentrations (0.05–40 nm) in PB buffer supplemented with 10% ethanol (PBE) for 3 h at 20 °C. The final reaction volume was 500 μl. Nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of 50 μm Thio T. The bound and free fractions were separated by vacuum filtration through GF/B glass filters (Whatman, Maidstone, UK) using an M-48T harvester (Brandel, Gaithersburg, MD) followed by four 1-ml washes with PBE. Filters containing the bound ligand were mixed with 3 ml of Ultima Gold MV scintillation liquid (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and incubated for 2 h before counting in a TriCarb 2100TR liquid scintillation counter (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). All data points were performed in triplicate. The specific binding signal under these assay conditions was ∼70%. Data were analyzed using Grafit to obtain the apparent dissociation constant (Kd) and the maximal number of binding sites (Bmax) using the single site ligand-binding module.Radioligand Competition Assays—Competition assays employed a fixed concentration of Aβ-(1–40) (40 nm) and [3H]Me-BTA-1 (4 nm) and used varying concentration ranges of cold competitor dependent on the ligand. Reactions were performed in PBE and were incubated for 2 h at 20 °C before harvesting and counting as described above. Nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of 50 μm Thio T. BF1 (200 nm) was used to determine nonspecific binding for assays involving Thio T. All data points were performed in triplicate, and the specific binding signal in the absence of competitor defined a fractional binding of 1. Data were analyzed using Grafit to obtain IC50 values using full 4-parameter curve fits. Ki values were derived as stated above using the Cheng-Prusoff equation (22Cheng Y. Prusoff W.H. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1973; 22: 3099-3108Crossref PubMed Scopus (12187) Google Scholar), where [L] was the concentration (4 nm) and Kd (4.2 nm) of the radioligand used in the assays.Density Gradient Centrifugation of Aβ Fibrils—Aβ fibril preparations were fractionated on gradients consisting of 700 μl each of 60, 50, 40, 30, 20, 10, and 280 μl of 5% Optiprep (Sigma) prepared in 13 × 51-mm ultraclear centrifuge tubes (Beckman Instruments, High Wycombe, UK). A 300-μl sample of Aβ fibrils (0.5 mg/ml) in PB was carefully layered on top of the Optiprep gradient and then fractionated at 50,000 rpm for 2 h and 30 min at 22 °C in an Optima Max-E ultracentrifuge using an MLS-50 swinging bucket rotor (Beckman Instruments). Following centrifugation, the bottoms of the tubes were pierced with a 21-gauge syringe needle, and 12 × 400-μl fractions were collected for analysis. Fraction 1 represents the most dense part of the gradient and fraction 12 the least dense part of the gradient.The fractions were analyzed for thioflavin T binding by mixing 80 μl of each fraction with 2 μl of 100 μm thioflavin and reading the fluorescence after 2 h of incubation in an Ultra Evolution 384 plate reader using a 450–505-nm filter pair. In addition, 5 μl of each fraction was separated by SDS-PAGE followed by blotting onto nitrocellulose as described previously (23Hong G. Lockhart A. Davis B. Rahmoune H. Baker S. Ye L. Thompson P. Shou Y. O'Shaughnessy K. Ronco P. Brown J. FASEB J. 2003; 17: 1966-1968Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Blots were probed with the mouse anti-human β-amyloid antibody 6E10 (Merck) at a 1:1000 dilution followed by an anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibody (Sigma) at a 1:10,000 and were then developed with SuperSignal West Dura extended duration substrate (Perbio, Cheshire, UK). Images of the blot were captured using a Chemigenius2 imaging system (Syngene, Cambridge, UK) and quantified using Genetools (Syngene). Radioligand binding was evaluated by mixing 50 μl of each fraction with 450 μl of 4 nm [3H]Me-BTA-1 prepared in PBE. The reactions were incubated for 2 h at 20 °C before harvesting and counting as described above by vacuum filtration.RESULTSDetermination of Binding Constants Using Fluorescence Assays—The compounds used in this study (Fig. 1) all share similar fluorescent properties, with excitation and emission wavelengths of around 340 and 440 nm, respectively, but that are distinct from those of Thio T (450:480 nm) (data not shown). In addition, the compounds display increases in their intrinsic FLINT when bound to Aβ-(1–40) fibrils along with slight shifts in their excitation and emission wavelengths consistent with ligand binding into a hydrophobic pocket on the fibrils. The exception to this was BTA-1, which displayed a slight decrease (∼5–10%) in FLINT when bound to the Aβ-(1–40) fibrils.The increases in FLINT upon ligand binding to Aβ-(1–40) fibrils were exploited in designing simple, homogeneous assays to directly measure compound binding. Two assay formats were employed, FLINT1 and FLINT2. In FLINT1 assays, compound binding was measured by using a fixed concentration of ligand (50 or 100 nm) and varying concentrations of Aβ-(1–40) polymer (Fig. 2, A and C). A fixed concentration of Aβ-(1–40) polymer (500 nm) and varying concentrations of ligand were used in the FLINT2 assays (Fig. 2, B and D).

Open table in a new tab The binding of BTA-1 to Aβ-(1–40) fibrils was determined by fluorescent anisotropy measurements using a fixed concentration of ligand (50 nm) and varying concentrations of polymer (Fig. 2E). The apparent Kd value from this assay was 5.23 μm. The anisotropy value of the compound at saturating concentrations of polymer was 0.4, which is toward the maximum limit for a fluorophore (24Pope A.J. Haupts U.M. Moore K.J. Drug Discov. Today. 1999; 4: 350-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar) and probably reflects the large Stokes radii of the Aβ-(1–40) polymers.The binding isotherms for all of the ligands in all assay formats were consistent with a single population of binding sites for each of the ligands. The apparent Kd values from the assays were found to be strongly dependent on the assay format, with the FLINT2 assays consistently reporting lower values. In addition, the rank order of binding constants for the individual compounds was conserved between the two assay formats (Table I).Comparison of the Kd2 values with the literature values obtained previously indicates that although fluorescence assays are reporting significantly higher values, the rank order of binding affinities is generally well conserved. The exception to this was Thio T whose Kd2 value was essentially identical to that reported using a similar assay format by Naiki et al. (25Naiki H. Higuchi K. Hosokawa M. Takeda T. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 177: 244-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (974) Google Scholar) and LeVine (26LeVine III, H. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 404-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (1917) Google Scholar), indicating that the present set of assays was accurately reporting binding constants.Comparison of Binding Constants Is Consistent with Two Classes of Binding Sites on the Aβ Fibrils—The observation that the binding constants were dependent on assay format was unexpected as both assay formats should report approximately the same Kd values. However, an explanation for this difference became apparent when the number of potential binding sites on the Aβ polymer was considered. The binding data previously reported with these ligands demonstrated that the binding site density on the Aβ fibrils was ≪1 site per Aβ peptide monomer (8Mathis C.A. Wang Y. Holt D.P. Huang G.F. Debnath M.L. Klunk W.E. J. Med. Chem. 2003; 46: 2740-2754Crossref PubMed Scopus (846) Google Scholar, 14Agdeppa E.D. Kepe V. Liu J. Flores-Torres S. Satyamurthy N. Petric A. Cole G.M. Small G.W.

This meant that the effective concentration of binding sites on the fibrils was potentially significantly less than the concentration of Aβ peptide monomers added to the FLINT1 assay. Because calculation of the Kd1 values are based on the Aβ peptide monomer concentration, this leads to an overestimation of the binding constant by a factor dependent on the binding site densit"

The Nanog and Oct-4 (POU5F1) transcription factors are key intrinsic determinants of self-renewal of embryonic stem cells (1Chambers I. Smith A. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 7150-7160Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar).

Smith A. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 7150-7160Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). It has been shown that Nanog function requires the continued presence of Oct-4 and together they support stem cell potency and self-renewal (4Cavaleri F. Scholer H.R. Cell. 2003; 113: 551-552Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Oct-4 prevents the differentiation of the inner cell mass and embryonic stem cells into trophectoderm, while Nanog blocks the differentiation into primitive endoderm and actively maintains pluripotency (5Pan G.J. Pei D.Q. Cell Res. 2003; 13: 499-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Nanog and Oct-4 are both expressed in pluripotent mouse and human cell lines including the undifferentiated human embryonal carcinoma cell line, NT2/D1 (6Hart A.H. Hartley L. Ibrahim M. Robb L. Dev. Dyn. 2004; 230: 187-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). The undifferentiated cells become committed to differentiate with retinoic acid (RA), unleashing a genetic program that involves the differential expression of more than 3000 genes (7Walker P.R. Ly D. Liu Q.-Y. Smith B. Sodja C. Ribecco M. Sikorska M. Janigro D. The Cell Cycle in the CNS. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ2005Google Scholar). Oct-4 protein levels are down-regulated in NT2 cells induced with RA to differentiate into neurons and glia (8Rosfjord E. Rizzino A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 203: 1795-1802Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In an ongoing effort to gain an overall understanding of the contribution of genetic and epigenetic factors to the control of neurogenesis, this study evaluates the changes in expression of Nanog and Oct-4 in the early stages of neuronal differentiation in relation to DNA methylation of their upstream regions. Methylation of genomic CpG residues is known to play a key role in embryogenesis by silencing specific genes during development and differentiation. DNA methylation in the region 1.3 kb upstream of the mouse Oct-4 gene has previously been reported by following RA treatment of mouse OTF9–63 EC cells (9Ben-Shushan E. Pikarsky E. Klar A. Bergman Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 891-901Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). These experiments, performed using methylation-sensitive restriction endonucleases, lacked base pair resolution but did establish that methylation operates in mouse cells. Subsequently, the mouse Oct-4 promoter was shown to undergo methylation at 6.5 days postcoitum in the whole embryo (10Gidekel S. Bergman Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 34521-34530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Moreover, Hattori et al. (11Hattori N. Nishino K. Ko Y.G. Hattori N. Ohgane J. Tanaka S. Shiota K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 17063-17069Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar) demonstrated methylation of the mouse Oct-4 promoter region in trophoblast stem cells. In an attempt to study the possibility of reversing the differentiation process, Tsuji-Takayama et al. (12Tsuji-Takayama K. Inoue T. Ijiri Y. Otani T. Motoda R. Nakamura S. Orita K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 323: 86-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) treated differentiated ES cells with a demethylating agent and found an increase in the expression of ES-specific genes such as Oct-4, Nanog, and Sox2. However, in this case, expression of any of these three genes could be an indirect consequence of demethylation of another gene. To our knowledge, the work presented here is the first report of direct changes in DNA methylation of specific sites within the promoter regions of human Oct-4 and Nanog genes during neurogenesis. We show that Nanog and Oct-4 are sequentially down-regulated early in RA-treated NT2 cells and that the decreases in gene expression are paralleled by dynamic, sequential methylation of CpG residues in both promoter regions as well as the enhancer region of Oct-4. Cell Culture and DNA Isolation—NT2/D1 cells (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) were seeded at a density of 2 × 106 cells per T75 flask and treated with 10 μm RA (Sigma, Oakville, Ontario, Canada) for 2–12 days. Fresh RA and Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen, Burlington, Ontario, Canada) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Wisent, Saint-Jean, Quebec, Canada) were supplied every 2 days. Cells were harvested at different time points by trypsinization, centrifuged at 194 g for 5 min, and washed with phosphate-buffered saline. Total genomic DNA was isolated from each sample (adapted from Ref. 13Miller S.A. Dykes D.D. Polesky H.F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 1215Crossref PubMed Scopus (17628) Google Scholar). Quantitative PCR—RNA was isolated with TriReagent (Bio-Can Scientific, Mississauga, Ontario, Canada), and a 20 μg/sample was used for cDNA synthesis using Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). Each duplicate quantitative PCR reaction contained 2 ng of cDNA and a 0.15 μm concentration of each primer in a 25-μl reaction volume. The 2 × PCR SYBR Green master mix was purchased from Applied Biosystems (Foster City, CA). PCR reactions were carried out in an Applied Biosystems 7000 machine as follows: 50 °C for 2 min for 1 cycle, 95 °C for 10 min for 1 cycle, and 40 cycles of 95 °C for 15 s and 60 °C for 1 min. A dissociation curve was run at the end of the reaction for product specificity. Bisulfite Genomic Sequencing—The EZ DNA methylation kit (Zymo Research, Orange, CA) was used to detect cytosine methylation. The sodium bisulfite treatment used 750 ng of genomic DNA. Briefly, the DNA was denatured with a dilution buffer containing 2 m NaOH and incubated overnight at 50 °C with CT conversion reagent, followed by a clean-up, desulfonation, and elution. The bisulfite-modified DNA was used immediately for PCR or stored at –70 °C. For PCR amplification, 2.5 μl of bisulfite-modified DNA was added in a final volume of 50 μl, containing 1 × PCR buffer (16.6 mm ammonium sulfate, 67 mm Tris, pH 8.8, 6.7 mm MgCl2, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol), dNTPs (1.25 mm concentration each), primers (1 pmol each), and 2.5 units of Hi Fidelity Platinum Taq (Invitrogen). The primers were designed to recognize the bisulfite-converted DNA only (Table I). PCR reactions were carried out in a MJ Research cycler (Waltham, MA) using the following protocol: 95 °C for 10 min, 35 cycles of 95 °C for 1 min, 50–58 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1 min, followed by an extension at 72 °C for 10 min and soak at 4 °C. After electrophoresis on a 2% agarose gel the remaining PCR products were cloned (Zero Blunt End, Invitrogen). Ten clones for each ligation were randomly picked and sequenced on an Applied Biosystems 377 instrument.Table IA list of primers, their sequences, and the annealing temperatures used for PCRPrimer (GenBank™ accession no.)SequenceAnnealing temperatureQPCRNanog-F (NM_024865)GCAGAAGGCCTCAGCACCTA60Nanog-RAGGTTCCCAGTCGGGTTCAOct4-F (Z11898)GCTCGAGAAGGATGTGGTCC60Oct4-RCGTTGTGCATAGTCGCTGCTN-Oct3-F (Z11933)GAGCGAGGAGAGGGAGCC60N-Oct3-RTCTCGGAGCCGGACTGAGPax6-F (NM_000280)CACACCGGTTTCCTCCTTCA60Pax6-RGGCAGAGCGCTGTAGGTGTTSox2-F (Z11898)CACTGCCCCTCTCACACATG60Sox2-RTCCCATTTCCCTCGTTTTTCTBisulfite PCRNanog-FTTAATTTATTGGGATTATAGGGGTG58Nanog-RAAACCTAAAAACAAACCCAACAACOct4-1FTTTTTAGTTTTTTTTAGGTTTAA50Oct4-1RTAAACAAAAAACCCATTCCCOct4-2FTTAGGAAAATGGGTAGTAGGGATTT58Oct4-2RTACCCAAAAAACAAATAAATTATAAAACCTOct4-3FATTTGTTTTTTGGGTAGTTAAAGGT58Oct4-3RCCAACTATCTTCATCTTAATAACATCCOct4-4FGGATGTTATTAAGATGAAGATAGTTGG58Oct4-4RCCTAAACTCCCCTTCAAAATCTATTOct4-5FAATAGATTTTGAAGGGGAGTTTAGG58Oct4-5RTTCCTCCTTCCTCTAAAAAACTCAOct4-6FGAAGGGGAAGTAGGGATTAATTTT58Oct4-6RCAACAACCATAAACACAATAACCAAOct4-7FTAGTTGGGATGTGTAGAGTTTGAGA58Oct4-7RTAAACCAAAACAATCCTTCTACTCCOct4-8FAAGTTTTTGTGGGGGATTTGTAT58Oct4-8RCCACCCACTAACCTTAACCTCTAOct4-9FGTTAGAGGTTAAGGTTAGTGGGTG58Oct4-9RAAACCTTAAAAACTTAACCAAATCC Open table in a new tab Down-regulation of the Human Nanog and Oct-4 Genes following RA Treatment—Quantitative PCR analysis of RNA extracted following RA treatment of NT2/D1 cells shows a decline in the expression levels of Oct-4 and Nanog (Fig. 1). Nanog expression starts to decline immediately, whereas there is a two-day delay before Oct-4 expression declines. The expression of Sox2, a binding partner for Oct-4, does not change. Pax6, a marker for radial glia and N-Oct3 (POU3F2), which is essential for neuronal migration and corticogenesis; each shows an increase in gene expression coinciding with the down-regulation of Nanog and Oct-4. Both Oct-4 and Nanog show a significant drop in gene expression by day 4 and are reduced to very low levels by days 6 and 8 of RA treatment. DNA Methylation Status of the 5′-Flanking Region of the Human Nanog Gene—Human Nanog is a newly identified gene on chromosome 12p13.31, whose promoter has not been characterized. The gene has 4 exons and 3 introns, comparable with the mouse chromosome 6 homolog (14Clark A.T. Rodriguez R.T. Bodnar M.S. Abeyta M.J. Cedars M.I. Turek P.J. Firpo M.T. Reijo Pera R.A. Stem Cells. 2004; 22: 169-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 15Booth H.A. Holland P.W. Genomics. 2004; 84: 229-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). We examined a section of DNA 500 bases upstream of the transcription start site (TSS). This probable promoter region shares homology with the mouse upstream region (1Chambers I. Smith A. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 7150-7160Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar), including conserved Oct-4 and Sox2 DNA-binding domains located at –104 to –118 bp. CpGs are sparsely spaced in this stretch of DNA. However, we observed a change in the methylation status for three closely spaced sites starting at day 4 of RA treatment (Fig. 2). This cluster is ∼200 bp upstream of the Oct-4/Sox2-binding domain. These sites are unmethylated (presence of an A residue, indicating a T residue on the opposite strand) in the undifferentiated state (Fig. 3) and remain methylated at day 10 RA (presence of a G residue indicating a methylated cytosine on the opposite strand, which does not convert to a T following bisulfite treatment). The percentage of clones with methylation at the three sites shows a steady increase from day 4 RA onwards, and the cluster remains methylated (>50%) beyond day 8 of RA treatment (Fig. 2) corresponding to the silencing of the gene.Fig. 3Bisulfite sequencing of the 5′-upstream region of the Nanog gene. The three CpG sites (along with their locations) that get methylated at day 10 RA are shown with the arrows. Unmethylated CpGs are represented by an A, indicating a T residue on the opposite strand. The presence of a G residue indicates a methylated cytosine on the opposite strand.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) DNA Methylation Profile of the 5′-Flanking Region of the Human Oct-4 Gene—The human Oct-4 gene, located on chromosome 6p21.31 is alternatively spliced, encoding two isoforms, 1 and 2. For this study, we looked at the region upstream of isoform 1 (GenBank™ accession number AJ297527), which has 5 exons and 4 introns. The gene encodes an mRNA sequence of 1413 bp and a protein of 360 amino acids (GenBank™ accession number NM_002701). There is no CpG island at the 5′ end of the Oct-4 gene (16Li L.C. Dahiya R. Bioinformatics. 2002; 18: 1427-1431Crossref PubMed Scopus (1913) Google Scholar), although CpG dinucleotide sequences are fairly abundant. We investigated the methylation status of 45 CpGs (Fig. 4) between –2973 and +153 bp from the TSS (+1). This region spans the proximal promoter and the proximal and distal enhancers (17Nordhoff V. Hubner K. Bauer A. Orlova I. Malapetsa A. Scholer H.R. Mamm. Genome. 2001; 12: 309-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Most of these sites are unmethylated in the undifferentiated cells, and there is a gradual increase in methylation by day 8 RA, which becomes much more extensive by day 12 of RA treatment (Fig. 4). In addition, the promoter/enhancer region has seven constitutively methylated CpGs between –464 and –825 (between the proximal promoter and the proximal enhancer) and two sites at –2724 and –2733 (upstream of the distal enhancer). The block of seven sites, already methylated in the undifferentiated cells remains methylated throughout, although there is an increase in the percentage of methylated clones even for these sites, increasing from 61% at day 0 to 90% by day 12 RA. Interestingly, the CpGs at different sites become methylated with different kinetics during the differentiation process (Fig. 4). Once methylated, the sites do not undergo demethylation at a later stage and the gene remains repressed. The specification of cell lineages in the developing brain is thought to be regulated by extrinsic and intrinsic factors. The intrinsic program of neuronal differentiation in NT2 cells, for example, involves the sequential expression of specific transcription factors, receptors, and signaling molecules (7Walker P.R. Ly D. Liu Q.-Y. Smith B. Sodja C. Ribecco M. Sikorska M. Janigro D. The Cell Cycle in the CNS. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ2005Google Scholar). The cells pass through a series of transient states; epigenetic modifications such as chromatin remodeling and DNA methylation play a key role in defining these states. CpG dinucleotides are the major target for DNA methylation, with cytosines on both strands being prone to modification to 5-methylcytosine. This has been shown to be a major mechanism of transcriptional silencing (18Siegfried Z. Eden S. Mendelsohn M. Feng X. Tsuberi B.Z. Cedar H. Nat. Genet. 1999; 22: 203-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). Most vertebrate DNA is de novo methylated at cytosine residues of CpG dinucleotides and must be demethylated to permit transcription. Stretches of GC-rich and relatively CpG-rich DNA sequences co-localize with some, but not all, promoter regions of genes. Methylation of only a few of these CpG sites can significantly down-regulate promoter activity (19Gonzalgo M.L. Hayashida T. Bender C.M. Pao M.M. Tsai Y.C. Gonzales F.A. Nguyen H.D. Nguyen T.T. Jones P.A. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 1245-1252PubMed Google Scholar). Methyl-CpG is now recognized as a gene-silencing signal (20Zhang Z. Chen C.Q. Manev H. J. Neurochem. 2004; 88: 1424-1430Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) because methylated CpG either interferes with the DNA binding of transcription factors or recruits methylated cytosine-binding domain proteins, which then engage other corepressors such as histone deacetylases. Since Nanog and Oct-4 are specifically expressed in undifferentiated NT2 cells, we sought to define a relationship between DNA methylation and gene expression in an in vitro model of human neurogenesis. This model consists of proliferating NT2 precursors that can be differentiated into postmitotic neurons and astrocytes with RA. To examine the methylation status of the two genes, we used the bisulfite sequencing method (21Clark S.J. Harrison J. Paul C.L. Frommer M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 2990-2997Crossref PubMed Scopus (1599) Google Scholar), which permits a comprehensive examination of every methylated CpG site in a target sequence. We show that CpG dinucleotides in the promoter region of both genes, as well as the enhancer region of Oct-4, are predominantly unmethylated in the undifferentiated state when the genes are active. As differentiation proceeds, the CpG dinucleotides become substantially methylated. DNA methylation of the two genes is sequential, paralleling their sequential decrease in expression, an exception being the unusual block of constitutively methylated CpG sites immediately upstream of the Oct-4 proximal promoter. This is a unique observation; however, the function of this block is unknown. We think that it could be a mark to initiate chromatin modification and/or DNA methylation to silence the proximal promoter and enhancer as the cells leave the stem or embryonal cell state following RA treatment. Since the human Oct-4 promoter has not been clearly defined, we have based our interpretation of the results on the comparative analyses of the human, mouse, and bovine Oct-4 upstream regions by Nordhoff et al. (17Nordhoff V. Hubner K. Bauer A. Orlova I. Malapetsa A. Scholer H.R. Mamm. Genome. 2001; 12: 309-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). They identified four highly conserved sequences in the human Oct-4 upstream region, CR1 (–74 to +56), CR2 (–1454 to –1259), CR3 (–1900 to –1796), and CR4 (–2501 to –2370), all relative to the TSS. CR1 spans the proximal promoter and almost completely overlaps in the three species. The CR2 region partially overlaps in the human and bovine sequences. In the mouse sequence, CR2 and CR4 span the proximal and distal enhancers, respectively. To date, no DNA binding activity has been associated with CR3. From our results, it is clear that three of the four CpG sites in the human proximal promoter are not methylated in the undifferentiated stage and are de novo methylated at later stages of differentiation. Expression of the Oct-4 gene in EC cells requires occupancy by transcription factors or other DNA-binding proteins of sites in the proximal promoter as well as the proximal and distal enhancers. Rapid down-regulation by retinoic acid is paralleled by the release of factors from all three sites (22Minucci S. Botquin V. Yeom Y.I. Dey A. Sylvester I. Zand D.J. Ohbo K. Ozato K. Scholer H.R. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 888-899Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 23Dey A. Ozato K. Methods. 1997; 11: 197-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) followed by the transient binding of repressor complexes (24Schoorlemmer J. Jonk L. Sanbing S. van Puijenbroek A. Feijen A. Kruijer W. Mol. Biol. Rep. 1995; 21: 129-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 25Fuhrmann G. Sylvester I. Scholer H.R. Cell. Mol. Biol. (Noisy-le-grand). 1999; 45: 717-724PubMed Google Scholar). Since DNA methylation commences soon after, it is unlikely to play a direct role in the cessation of transcriptional activity but ensures long term silencing of the gene. Similar studies remain to be carried out for Nanog. In both genes, there is a significant delay between decreasing levels of transcript and increased methylation, suggesting that methylation per se is not the primary event in switching off gene transcription but is involved in a later step of silencing. In one of the few other studies on the kinetics of DNA methylation, Mutskov and Felsenfeld (26Mutskov V. Felsenfeld G. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 138-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar) recently studied the transcriptional silencing of stably integrated transgenes and specifically excluded DNA methylation as the primary causative event. They propose the loss of histone acetylation and H3 K4 di- and trimethylation as early steps in a sequence of events leading up to the process of silencing. Initially, the gene is repressed reversibly, since transcription can be partially reactivated by inhibition of histone deacetylases. Methylation of histone H3 K9 and of DNA cytosines in the promoters are later events that could “lock” this stable silenced chromatin state. Whether these rules hold true for endogenous genes as well has not been determined. However, it has indeed been suggested in the case of mouse Oct-4 (10Gidekel S. Bergman Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 34521-34530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) and our results certainly support such a model. In both cases, the presence of promoter region CpG methylation almost certainly imposes an inability to return to an active state. To determine whether histone modification plays a key role for gene silencing in this case, we plan to do a comprehensive study where histone modifications at the Oct-4 and Nanog upstream regions will be analyzed by chromatin immunoprecipitation-PCR assays. Finally, it is clear that exit from an embryonal or stem cell state is effected, at least in part, by methylation of the promoter regions of two key determinants of self-renewal, Nanog and Oct-4. From this point on, the cells are committed to differentiate or die by apoptosis, and in the case of RA-stimulated NT2 cells, they immediately express the Pax6 gene, a determinant of the radial glia phenotype. Thus, the establishment of a normally regulated pattern of DNA methylation is essential for proper development and the importance of this epigenetic modification is emphasized by the fact that abnormalities in regulating DNA methylation are frequently associated with tumorigenesis and cell aging. In addition, DNA methylation has been implicated in a number of other distinct cellular processes including transcriptional regulation, embryogenesis, regulation of chromatin structure, genomic imprinting, X-inactivation, etc. However, the list of developmentally regulated genes that have been examined in the context of methylation is very short. This study emphasizes the importance of elucidating the role of methylation in the control of more genes like Nanog and Oct-4 that are critical in maintaining the phenotype of ES cells.

Our results show that these responses are associated with prolonged Akt phosphorylation relative to time-matched controls and are dependent on phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase) and Smad2/3 signaling, based on the ability of the PI 3-kinase inhibitor LY294002 or infection with adenoviral dominant negative Smad3 (DN-Smad3) mutant to attenuate induction of cyclin D2, inhibin-α, aromatase, SCC, SF-1, and epiregulin. The DN-Smad3 mutant also abolished prolonged Akt phosphorylation stimulated by FSH plus activin 24 h post-treatment. Infection with the adenoviral constitutively active forkhead box-containing protein, O subfamily (FOXO)1 mutant suppressed induction of cyclin D2, aromatase, inhibin-α, SF-1, and epiregulin. Transient transfections of GCs with constitutively active FOXO1 mutant also suppressed cyclin D2, inhibin-α, and epiregulin promoter-reporter activities. Chromatin immunoprecipitation results demonstrate in vivo the association of FOXO1 with the cyclin D2 promoter in untreated GCs and release of FOXO1 from the cyclin D2 promoter upon addition of FSH plus activin. These results suggest that proliferation and differentiation of GCs in response to FSH plus activin requires both removal of FOXO1-dependent repression and positive signaling from Smad2/3. Ovarian follicles undergo exponential growth in response to follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), largely as a result of the proliferation of granulosa cells (GCs). In vitro under serum-free conditions, rat GCs differentiate in response to FSH but do not proliferate unless activin is also present. In the presence of FSH plus activin, GCs exhibit enhanced expression of cyclin D2 as well as inhibin-α, aromatase, steroidogenic factor-1 (SF-1), cholesterol side chain (SCC), and epiregulin.

Ovarian follicles produce hormones and growth factors that regulate not only the hypothalamic-pituitary axis, uterine receptivity, and secondary sex characteristics but also in an autocrine or paracrine manner, granulosa, and theca cells as well as the oocyte contained within a follicle. The initial recruitment of primordial follicles is incompletely understood, but appears to require members of the transforming growth factor β (TGFβ) 1The abbreviations used are: TGFβ, transforming growth factor β; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; FSH, follicle-stimulating hormone; SF-1, steroidogenic factor-1; PCNA, proliferating cell nuclear antigen; SCC, P450 side chain cleavage enzyme; Cdk, cyclin-dependent kinase; PI 3-kinase, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; RT-PCR, reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction; DN, dominant negative; EGF, epidermal growth factor; IGF1, insulin-like growth factor 1, LRH-1, liver receptor homolog-1; mTOR, mammalian target of rapamycin; GC, granulosa cell; ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation; WT, wild type; pfu, plaque-forming unit; X-gal, 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; FOXO, forkhead box-containing protein, O subfamily.1The abbreviations used are: TGFβ, transforming growth factor β; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; FSH, follicle-stimulating hormone; SF-1, steroidogenic factor-1; PCNA, proliferating cell nuclear antigen; SCC, P450 side chain cleavage enzyme; Cdk, cyclin-dependent kinase; PI 3-kinase, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; RT-PCR, reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction; DN, dominant negative; EGF, epidermal growth factor; IGF1, insulin-like growth factor 1, LRH-1, liver receptor homolog-1; mTOR, mammalian target of rapamycin; GC, granulosa cell; ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation; WT, wild type; pfu, plaque-forming unit; X-gal, 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; FOXO, forkhead box-containing protein, O subfamily. family including bone morphogenic protein-7 (BMP-7) (1Shimasaki S.

Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 5005-5014Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Subsequent granulosa cell (GC) proliferation to form a secondary follicle requires the oocyte product growth differentiation factor-9 (GDF-9), also a member of the TGFβ family (3Shimasaki S.

However, GC proliferation during these early stages of folliculogenesis proceeds with a doubling time of greater than 7 days (4Hirshfield A.N. Intern. Rev. Cyt. 1991; 124: 43-101Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and is independent of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) (1Shimasaki S. Moore R.K. Otsuka F. Erickson G.F. Endocr.

Final follicular maturation to a preovulatory phenotype requires FSH (6Kumar T.R. Wang Y. Lu N. Matzuk M.M. Nat. Genet. 1997; 15: 201-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (1002) Google Scholar). In response to an FSH stimulus in the intact animal, GC doubling time is reduced to ∼24 h (4Hirshfield A.N. Intern. Rev. Cyt. 1991; 124: 43-101Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and GCs express proteins that characterize the preovulatory phenotype such as P450 aromatase (aromatase), P450 side chain cleavage (SCC), inhibin-α, and others (7Hsueh A.J.W. Adashi E.Y. Jones P.B.C. Welsh Jr., T.H. Endocr. Rev. 1984; 5: 76-110Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although GCs are the only FSH target in female mammals, rat GCs do not divide in primary culture under serum-free conditions (7Hsueh A.J.W. Adashi E.Y. Jones P.B.C. Welsh Jr., T.H. Endocr. Rev. 1984; 5: 76-110Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, rat GCs in the presence of FSH plus activin or GDF-9 do proliferate under serum-free culture conditions (8Li R. Phillips D.M. Mather J.P.

Additionally, while FSH alone promotes GC differentiation (7Hsueh A.J.W. Adashi E.Y. Jones P.B.C. Welsh Jr., T.H. Endocr.

This receptor, via the stimulatory G protein Gs, promotes activation of adenylyl cyclase, generating increased cAMP production (7Hsueh A.J.W. Adashi E.Y. Jones P.B.C. Welsh Jr., T.H. Endocr.

However, in contrast to this differentiation response to FSH, the cellular mechanisms by which FSH stimulates GC proliferation are poorly understood. Progression from G1 to the S phase of the cell cycle is mediated by increased expression of the cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk) 4/6 partner cyclin D followed by increased expression of the Cdk2 partner cyclin E (31Sherr C.J. Cell. 1994; 79: 551-555Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2509) Google Scholar, 32Coqueret O. Gene (Amst.). 2002; 299: 35-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). The resulting hyperphosphorylation of the retinoblastoma (Rb) protein catalyzed by Cdk 4/6 and subsequently by Cdk2 relieves inhibition of the transcription factor E2F by Rb, allowing for the expression of genes necessary for DNA replication and S phase entry (31Sherr C.J. Cell. 1994; 79: 551-555Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2509) Google Scholar, 32Coqueret O. Gene (Amst.). 2002; 299: 35-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). Cell cycle progression is also regulated by the levels of the Cdk inhibitors p27Kip1, p21Waf1, p130, and others (31Sherr C.J. Cell. 1994; 79: 551-555Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2509) Google Scholar, 32Coqueret O. Gene (Amst.). 2002; 299: 35-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). FSH-stimulated GC proliferation in intact animals requires increased expression of cyclin D2; follicles of cyclin D2-null mice do not proceed beyond the secondary stage of development (33Robker R.L. Richards J.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 924-940Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). Similarly, follicles of FSH-null mice do not proceed beyond the secondary stage of follicle development (6Kumar T.R. Wang Y. Lu N. Matzuk M.M. Nat. Genet. 1997; 15: 201-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (1002) Google Scholar). Yet, the addition of FSH alone to serum-free GC cultures promotes at most a modest (9Ogawa T. Yogo K. Ishida N. Takeya T. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 2003; 210: 31-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 34Sicinski P. Donaher J.L. Geng Y. Parker S.B. Gardner H. Park M.Y. Robker R.L. Richards J.S. McGinnis L.K. Biggers J.D. Eppig J.J. Bronson R.T. Elledge S.J. Weinberg R.A. Nature. 1996; 384: 470-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar) increase in cyclin D2 protein expression. However, in the presence of activin, cyclin D2 mRNA expression is strongly enhanced by FSH under serum-free culture conditions (9Ogawa T. Yogo K. Ishida N. Takeya T. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 2003; 210: 31-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 10El Hefnawy T. Zeleznik A.J. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 4357-4362Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). There is also a recent report that FSH-stimulated proliferation of porcine GCs is associated with exit of the Cdk2 inhibitor p27Kip1 from the nucleus, thereby relieving its inhibition of Cdk2 (22Cunningham M.A. Zhu Q. Hammond J.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 2004; 18: 1756-1767Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). In this report we sought to evaluate the signaling pathways by which FSH plus activin mediate GC proliferation. Recent studies from various cellular models suggest that the PI 3-kinase pathway plays a prominent role in regulating cell cycle progression. Signals into the PI 3-kinase pathway, traditionally via the insulin or insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) receptors, result in the activation of the serine/threonine kinase Akt (35Brazil D.P. Yang Z.Z. Hemmings B.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2004; 29: 233-242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar) leading to the phosphorylation of a number of substrates (direct and indirect), including three of the forkhead transcription factors in the FOXO subfamily (forkhead box-containing protein, O subfamily; FOXO1, -3a, and -4); tuberin, the upstream regulator of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR); and glycogen synthase kinase β (GSK3β). Akt has been reported to regulate cell cycle progression by a variety of pathways. Akt can block the action of the cell cycle inhibitors p27Kip1 and/or p21Waf1 by promoting their direct phosphorylation, resulting in their exit from the nucleus (36Viglietto G. Motti M.L. Bruni P. Melillo R.M. D'Alessio A. Califano D. Vinci F. Chiappetta G. Tsichlis P. Bellacosa A. Fusco A. Santoro M. Nat. Med. 2002; 8: 1136-1144Crossref PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar, 37Liang J.

Med. 2002; 8: 1145-1152Crossref PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar). However, this phosphorylation site on p27Kip1 is not conserved in rats (35Brazil D.P. Yang Z.Z. Hemmings B.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2004; 29: 233-242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar, 39Sekimoto T. Fukumoto M. Yoneda Y. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 1934-1942Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Regulation of the cyclins can occur as a result of Akt-dependent activation of mTOR, which functions to relieve inhibition of translational machinery, resulting in increased expression of cyclins (40Muise-Helmericks R.C.

Treisman J.E. Hariharan I.K. Cell. 2001; 105: 345-355Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). Regulation of the cyclins can also occur at the level of proteasomal degradation. In the absence of signaling down the PI 3-kinase pathway, GSK3β is active and phosphorylates the D-type cyclins, leading to their ubiquitination and degradation (42Bai J. Nakamura H. Ueda S.

Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3499-3511Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Regulation of both the cyclins and/or p27Kip1 can also occur at the level of Akt-regulated FOXO transcription factors, which are functional in the absence of PI 3-kinase signals. In response to phosphorylation by Akt, the DNA binding affinity of FOXO1, -3a, and -4 factors is reduced and they exit the nucleus (46Van Der Heide L.P. Hoekman M.F. Smidt M.P. Biochem.

Inactivation of FOXO upon Akt-dependent phosphorylation would result in decreased expression of the Cdk inhibitors, increased expression of cyclin D, and decreased expression of cyclin G2, thereby favoring cell cycle progression. Indeed, FOXO3a-null mice exhibit global follicular maturation and consequent follicular depletion as a result of increased GC mitotic activity at the primary stage of follicular development, consistent with a role for FOXO3a to suppress early follicular maturation (60Castrillon D.H.

It is not known how activin/GDF-9 synergizes with FSH to initiate the cell cycle. TGFβ family members including activin and GDF-9 bind to the type II cell surface receptor, the type I receptor is recruited and phosphorylated by the type II receptor, and the type I receptor then phosphorylates the mediatory Smad proteins (Smad2 and -3) (1Shimasaki S. Moore R.K. Otsuka F. Erickson G.F. Endocr. Rev. 2004; 25: 72-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar, 62Lutz M. Knaus P. Cell Signal. 2002; 14: 977-988Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Co-Smad4 binds to Smad2 or -3, and the complex translocates to the nucleus where it initiates transcription by complexing with other transcription factors and coactivators (62Lutz M. Knaus P. Cell Signal. 2002; 14: 977-988Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Smad3-deficient mice exhibit reduced fertility (63Tomic D. Brodie S.G. Deng C. Hickey R.J. Babus J.K. Malkas L.H. Flaws J.A. Biol. Reprod. 2002; 66: 917-923Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A recent study showed that the reduced fertility of the Smad3-deficient mice results from slowed follicle growth and low levels of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), cyclin D2, and Cdk4 (64Tomic D. Miller K.P. Kenny H.A. Woodruff T.K. Hoyer P. Flaws J.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 2004; 18: 2224-2440Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). We report herein that FSH plus activin uniquely promote sustained phosphorylation/activation of Akt 24 h post ligand addition compared with time-matched controls, and that this response is correlated with induction of cyclin D2 and PCNA as well as increased thymidine incorporation into DNA. Prolonged Akt phosphorylation as well as induction of cyclin D2, SF-1, and markers of differentiation are blocked by infection of GCs with an adenoviral dominant negative (DN)-Smad3 mutant, which lacks activin type I receptor phosphorylation sites. FOXO1 appears to function as a repressor of cyclin D2 expression, based on results showing that infection of GCs with an adenoviral constitutively active FOXO1 mutant abrogates the induction of cyclin D2 as well as cyclin D2-luciferase reporter activity stimulated by FSH plus activin in GCs. In vivo association of constitutively active FOXO1 with cyclin D2 in GCs is confirmed by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay. Taken together, these results suggest that FSH plus activin signal to sustain Akt phosphorylation by a pathway that requires Smad2/3 phosphorylation, thereby relieving cyclin D2 from repression, and allowing the cell cycle to progress.

https://openalex.org/W2081308583,"Using an atomic force microscope, we have studied three-dimensional molecular topography and calcium-sensitive conformational changes of individual hemichannels. Full-length (non-truncated) Cx43 hemichannels (connexons), when reconstituted in lipid bilayer, appear as randomly distributed individual particles and clusters. They show a lack of preferential orientation of insertion into lipid membrane; in a single bilayer, connexons with protrusion of either the extracellular face or the large non-truncated cytoplasmic face are observed. Extracellular domains of these undocked hemichannels are structurally different from hemichannels in the docked gap junctional plaques examined after their exposure by force dissection or chemical dissection. Calcium induced a reversible change in the extracellular pore diameter. Hemichannels imaged in a physiological buffer with 1.8 mm Ca+2 had the pore diameter of ∼1.8 nm, consistent with the closed channel conformation. Reducing Ca+2 concentration to ∼1.4, 1, and 0 mm, which changes hemichannels from the closed to open conformation, increased the pore diameter to ∼2.5 nm for ∼27, 74, and 100% of hemichannels, respectively. Thus, open/close probability of the hemichannel appears to be [Ca2+]-dependent. Computational analysis of the atomic force microscopy phase mode imaging reveals a significantly higher interfacial energy for open hemichannels that results from the interactions between the atomic force microscope probe and the hydrophobic domains. Thus, hydrophobic extracellular domains of connexins regulate calcium-dependent conformational changes.

Thus, hydrophobic extracellular domains of connexins regulate calcium-dependent conformational changes. Gap junctions are composed of two hemichannels (or connexons) in the plasma membranes of apposing cells. They allow the diffusion-driven transfer of ions and small cytoplasmic molecules between interconnected cells, synchronize electrical activity, and regulate metabolic homeostasis, cell growth, and differentiation (for reviews, see Refs. 1Harris A.L.

Ultrastructural studies of intercellular channels using gap junctional plaques show that the smaller connexons (e.g. liver gap junctions) are hexagonally packed in a crystalline pattern. Each connexon contains six connexins (e.g. Cx32, Cx26), is roughly cylindrical, ∼7.5 nm tall and ∼7 nm in diameter with a 1.5–2-nm pore (Refs. 7Unwin P.N.T. Zampighi G.

Paul D.L. Goodenough D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 2621-2629Crossref PubMed Scopus (915) Google Scholar) have a large cytoplasmic tail (the “cytoplasmic fuzz”) (12Manjunath C.K. Page E. J. Membr. Biol. 1986; 90: 43-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), which is non-rigid and labile and thus renders them less suitable for high resolution studies. Ultrastructural studies of recombinant Cx43 gap junctions with truncated cytoplasmic tail, crystallized in its closed state, show that the transmembrane domains share structural similarity with Cx32 gap junctions (13Unger V.M. Kumar N.M. Gilula N.B. Yeager M. Science. 1999; 283: 1176-1180Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). No structural study is, however, available on non-truncated Cx43 or other larger connexons, and especially, non-crystalline connexons in their native environment.Recent studies support the presence and activity of hemichannels in non-junctional plasma membrane regions (14Abrams C.K.

In mammalian tissues, non-junctional connexons composed of major connexins (e.g. Cx43, Cx26, and Cx32) are usually inactive (but see Ref. 26Contreras J.E. Sáez J.C. Bukauskas F.F. Bennett M.V.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 11388-11393Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar), and many connexins, including Cx46, Cx50, Cx45, and Cx35, when expressed in Xenopus oocyte and in mammalian cell expression systems, induce conductance through cell plasma membrane. Unlike intercellular gap junctional channels (exposed to only intracellular ionic milieu), activity of non-junctional hemichannels (exposed to both intra- and extracellular milieux) appears to be modulated in a manner similar to other conventional ion channels (for a review, see Ref. 25Goodenough D.A. Paul D.L. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 4: 285-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar). From the cytoplasmic side, non-junctional connexons can be gated by experimental manipulations (e.g. by pH, [Ca2+], membrane potential, metabolites, and cyclic nucleotides) similarly as for intercellular gap junctional channels. From the extracellular side, non-junctional connexons are not gated by pH and nucleotides but by calcium (see Refs. 16Li H. Liu T. Lazarak A. Peracchia C. Goldberg G.S. Lampe P.D. Johnson R.G. J.

Hand G.M. Engel A. Sosinsky G.E. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3598-3607Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). However, no such study is reported for connexons consisting of connexins with larger extramembranous mass (e.g. Cx43) and especially for predocked or undocked randomly distributed Cx43 hemichannels, as would occur in the non-junctional plasma membrane region. Moreover, despite the known functional dose-dependent hemichannel gating, no structural study is available to distinguish graded versus all-or-none channel opening and closing.In the present study, using atomic force microscopy, we examined three-dimensional molecular surface topography as well as the effect of different divalent cations on the conformations of individual non-crystalline, non-truncated Cx43 hemichannels reconstituted in lipid membranes. Calcium induced conformational changes (closing/opening) in the channel pore in [Ca2+]-dependent fashion. We further used AFM phase mode imaging and computational analysis (31Mechler A. Kokavecz J. Heszler P. Lal R. Appl. Phys. Lett. 2003; 82: 3740-3742Crossref Scopus (32) Google Scholar) for the first time on membrane channels to reveal that extracellular hydrophobic domains of connexins regulate calcium-dependent conformational changes.MATERIALS AND METHODSHemichannel Isolation—Wild type BICR-M1Rk (Marshall) cell line expressing Cx43 was obtained from Dr. D. Hulser and was grown as described (22Quist A.P. Rhee S.K. Lin H. Lal R. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 1063-1074Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). Connexons were isolated by published methods (32Rhee S.K. Bevans C.G. Harris A.L. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 9212-9223Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were collected and homogenized in Hanks' buffer containing 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 1 mm MgCl2, dithiothreitol, and protease inhibitor mixture at 4 °C. Lysate was centrifuged at 1,000 × g for 5 min, and supernatant was then centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h. Pellets were resuspended in Hanks' buffer with 0.25 m sucrose, loaded on a 1.2/2.0 m sucrose step gradient, and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 2.5 h. The plasma membrane fraction containing connexons between 0.25 and 1.2 m sucrose gradients was collected and solubilized with buffer S (20 mm HEPES, 50 mm NaCl, 50 mm octylglucoside, pH 7.4). The solution was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min, and the supernatant was incubated with an anti-peptide CT23 (DQRPSSRASSRASSRPRPDDLEI) antibody coupled to Sepharose 4B beads for 2 h under gentle stirring. The beads were then transferred onto a column and washed with 50 ml of buffer S containing 1 mg of phosphatidylcholine/ml. Connexons were eluted with buffer S containing 5 μm peptide CT23 and 1 mg of phosphatidylcholine/ml. The purity of extracted connexons was evaluated by silver staining and Western blot following SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis as described (19Lal R. John S.A. Laird D.W. Arnsdorf M.F. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: C968-C977Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 33Yancey B. John S. Lal R. Austin B. Revel J.-P. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 2241-2254Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). A silver stain gel of the purified proteins and the Western blot of purified Cx43 are shown below (see Fig. 1C).Hemichannel Reconstitution—1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphatidyl-choline (DOPC, Avanti Inc.) was dissolved in chloroform, dried with argon gas, and resuspended in HEPES or phosphate-buffered saline buffer (pH 7.2–7.4) at a concentration of 1 mg/ml. Unilaminar liposomes were formed with DOPC by extrusion using LipoFast from Avestin Inc. (Ottawa, Canada). To reconstitute connexons into liposome membrane, purified connexons were then mixed with the liposomes (∼1:1,000 w/w protein:lipid) and bath-sonicated for 15 min. The liposomes were then deposited on freshly cleaved mica for 20 min, rinsed with buffer (HEPES or phosphate-buffered saline), and heated at 37–39 °C for 2–3 min to fuse liposomes into planar bilayers (34Lin H. Bhatia R. Lal R. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 2433-2444Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar).AFM Imaging and Data Analysis—The specimens were imaged by AFM as described (22Quist A.P. Rhee S.K. Lin H. Lal R. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 1063-1074Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar, 34Lin H. Bhatia R. Lal R. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 2433-2444Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar, 35Lal R. John S.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 256: C1-C21Crossref Google Scholar). Briefly, AFM images were collected using a NanoScope III Multimode AFM (Digital Instruments). The AFM probes were DNP-S- or oxide-sharpened silicon nitride (Si3N4) tips and were operated at the resonance frequencies of 5–35 kHz with free oscillating amplitudes of ∼20–35 nm. Most of the imaging was carried out in tapping mode or low force contact mode with scanning speeds from 1 to 7 Hz that allowed simultaneous collection of the height and phase data. All AFM imaging of planer lipid bilayers with or without reconstituted Cx43 connexons were conducted at room temperature (22–24 °C) in physiological buffer solution (pH 7.2–7.4) as described (22Quist A.P. Rhee S.K. Lin H. Lal R. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 1063-1074Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). To confirm the cytoplasmic versus extracellular side and also to provide additional assurance for the specimen purity, we imaged anti-Cx43 antibody-connexon complexes. These experiments were not intended for high resolution imaging, rather only for obtaining qualitative distinction between cytoplasmic and extracellular sides. First, we imaged connexons and identified them with their exposed cytoplasmic or extracellular side using previously defined criteria. Then, monoclonal antibody against the cytoplasmic tail of Cx43 (CT23) was perfused on-line, and its preferential binding (or non-binding) was used to distinguish the sidedness.For examining calcium-dependent conformational changes, each reconstituted membrane and hemichannel constituted its own internal control, i.e. they were imaged before and after ionic perturbations. Different solutions (Ca2+-free, 1 mm Ca2+, 1.4 mm Ca2+, 1.8 mm Ca2+, 1.8 mm Ni2+ (without Ca2+), or 1.8 mm Mg2+ (without Ca2+) in 10 mm HEPES buffer) were perfused into liquid cells alternately to examine the effects of divalent cations on connexon structure. The electrolyte perfusion was accomplished in ∼10–15 s. As the flow interferes with the imaging, there were no AFM images collected during the perfusion. The next complete image was collected in a minute or so, and thus, we have imaged only the steady-state conformations. No real-time kinetics of channel opening and closing was examined.In ∼80% of all the experiments, bilayers were resolved, and in ∼10% of these bilayers, hemichannels could be well resolved for further high resolution structure-function analysis. The inner and outer diameters of connexons were measured at 2/3 of full height with respect to the lipid membrane plane based on cross-sections of height mode AFM images (19Lal R. John S.A. Laird D.W. Arnsdorf M.F. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: C968-C977Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Connexon diameter was measured on 50 individual connexons (from 100 to 300 nm scan size images at 512 × 512 pixels) for each buffer condition using Nanoscope III software (v. 4.23) and the WSXM freeware (Nanotec Electronica, Spain). Measured values are presented as mean ± S.D.Phase Imaging and Numerical Simulation—AFM phase and height mode images were obtained simultaneously in tapping mode. Phase shift is a function of probe-sample interactions and can reveal sample properties, such as elasticity, charge distribution, surface energy, or energy dissipation (36Cleveland J.P.

Attempts to quantify the absolute phase shift provided inconclusive quantitative results about the sample material properties so far (36Cleveland J.P. Anczykowski B. Schmid A.E. Elings V.B. Appl.

However, the relative phase change, when only one (or a few) of the surface properties varies, while other unknown parameters are kept invariant for different surface areas, allows quantitative interpretation (31Mechler A.

Lett. 2003; 82: 3740-3742Crossref Scopus (32) Google Scholar).Simulation of AFM phase imaging was carried out according to a previously described method (31Mechler A. Kokavecz J. Heszler P. Lal R.

Phys. Lett. 2003; 82: 3740-3742Crossref Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Briefly, the AFM probe is a linear spring with an effective mass at the end (tip) and is driven close to its resonance frequency. The probe oscillates over the sample surface and makes contact for a short duration in each period. The tip-sample contact force is described by the Maugis continuum mechanics and is a function of the normalized tip-sample curvature, the normalized elastic modulus, the interfacial energy, and the interatomic distance. For our study, the variation of the interfacial energy is the dominant parameter, and the effects of the changes in other parameters are negligible (31Mechler A. Kokavecz J. Heszler P. Lal R. Appl. Phys. Lett. 2003; 82: 3740-3742Crossref Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Interfacial energy is defined as the work needed to separate two contacting surfaces and is affected by the surrounding medium (air, liquid). In an aqueous medium, the interfacial energy is reduced by the energy of immersion (related to the surface tension), and for hydrophobic surfaces, it is increased by the energy of solvation. Thus, a significant increase in the observed interfacial energy in water would indicate hydrophobic interactions between the probe-sample surfaces (44Israelachvili J.N. Intermolecular and Surface Forces: With Applications to Colloidal and Biological Systems. Oxford Academic Press, London1985Google Scholar).RESULTSStructure of the Cytoplasmic and Extracellular Domains— The thickness of the bilayer without any reconstituted connexons is ∼5.0 ± 0.5 nm, as determined from isolated membrane patches and cross-sections of the force-dissected bilayers. The bilayer thickness is consistent with previous AFM measurements of DOPC lipid bilayer in similar aqueous imaging environments (34Lin H. Bhatia R. Lal R. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 2433-2444Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar). The surface topography of these bilayers appears to be smooth and featureless (Fig. 1A). Connexons reconstituted in bilayer appear as structures protruding out from the bilayer surface in a randomly distributed diffused pattern (Fig. 1B, few examples, blue circles). The outer diameter of these connexons is 8.27 ± 0.8 nm.Connexons appear to fall within two groups with distinct features including differences in the extramembranous protrusion height and structural details. Three-dimensional segmentation area analysis of 100 randomly distributed connexons indicates that ∼60% of the connexons are of height 1.29 ± 0.44 nm (Fig. 2A, red circles), and ∼40% of the connexons are of height ∼4.71 ± 0.45 nm (white circles). Height mode images of the first group (1.29 nm in height) exhibit better structural details. Six subunits representing constituent connexins are visible in many connexons, and there is an unambiguous presence of a pore with an indentation depth up to ∼0.8 nm when imaged in nominal calcium-free buffer. The second group (4.71 nm in height) shows less defined substructures, and in most cases, do not show a pore (Fig. 2A). Fig. 2B shows a cross-section along the line in the figure; three left structures represent the first group (red arrows), whereas the fourth represents the second group (green arrow). The right shoulder on the fourth structure is the side of a hemichannel near the line (Fig. 2A). The height difference is apparently due to the larger cytoplasmic tail (CT) that protrudes out considerably farther from the membrane. Thus, a clear distinction of the sidedness of imaged connexons is achieved that is consistent with previous biochemical and structural studies of Cx43 connexons (19Lal R. John S.A. Laird D.W.

B, height profile cross-section along the line in A shows two connexon populations that protrude ∼0.5–2 and ∼4–5.5 nm from the membrane plane, respectively. Hemichannels protruding ∼0.5–2 nm (few examples; red circles) show clear central pores with six subunits, whereas hemichannels protruding ∼4–5.5 nm (few examples; white circles) show no such structural detail. Imaging was performed in Ca2+-free buffer. These two populations represent the extracellular (lower protrusion) and the cytoplasmic (higher protrusion) faces of connexons, respectively. Scan size for A and B: 250 nm. C, anti-Cx43-antibodies specific for a cytoplasmic epitope (red circle) absorbed on mica surface. A fork-like structure is visible for many of these individual antibodies. Image size: 470 nm. D1–4 show two individual extracellular-sided connexons (red circles) before (D1 and D3) and after (D2 and D4) antibody incubation. No antibody binding was observed, and the overall structural features on each connexon remained same. Scan size: 20 nm. E1–4 show two sets of clusters of cytoplasmic-sided connexons (red and green circles) in the lipid membrane before (E1 and E3) and after (E2 and E4) antibody binding. Antibody binding increased the overall volume of the bound complexes. Scan size is 20 nm. The height scale in E2 and E4 is about twice as that of D2 and D4 antibody binding.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)In addition, images of the anti-Cx43 antibody (CT23)-connexon complexes show that antibody bound preferentially to the structures that have the features (greater height, lack of ultrastructural details, etc.) characteristic of the cytoplasmic side (Fig. 2, C–E). The volumes of the extracellular and cytoplasmic sides were ∼21 and 87 nm3, respectively. The volume of the cytoplasmic side-antibody complex was ∼405 nm3 after antibody binding, and the volume of the antibody alone was ∼300 nm3. Consistent with the antibody specificity, no volume change was observed for the extracellular side. Volumes measured in our study are comparable with other protein macromolecules (48Schneider S.W. Larmer J. Henderson R.M. Oberleithener H. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1998; 435: 362-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). These results further confirm the presence of two distinct populations of cytoplasmic and extracellular-facing hemichannels in a reconstituted patch. Moreover, the antibody binding results also argue against the (unlikely) possibility of the higher structures (versus the extracellular side) being whole junctional channels; there is simply not enough volume change to account for two apposed hemichannels being isolated and reconstituted together.Effect of Calcium on the Hemichannel Extracellular Face—A detailed analysis of the Ca2+-sensitive conformational change was performed only for those structures that resembled the characteristics of hemichannels, namely, six subunits and a height of <2 nm from the outer membrane surface. Particles with the diameter of connexons but no substructure were excluded from the analysis. Such strict criteria for selecting hemichannels for conformational studies ensured that we were not looking at non-connexon structures, including its associative protein macromolecules, and thus minimized any potential bias in our data pool versus automated selection process; the same structural features would have been used to define the automatic selection process. Moreover, each reconstituted membrane and hemichannel constituted its own internal control, i.e. they were imaged before and after ionic perturbations. The most definitive evidence that the imaged structures indeed are Cx43 hemichannels would require labeling them on-line with anti-Cx43 antibody subsequent to their imaging. In the absence of such definite evidence, structures imaged in this study could be termed “putative hemichannels.”For calcium-dependent conformational changes, hemichannels were first selected in their open conformation with clearly visible pore (i.e. when imaged in the absence of calcium) to ensure that any calcium-dependent change is observed for only those structures that have features and calcium-sensitive characteristics of hemichannels. Then, [Ca2+] was increased on-line to a desired level (Ca2+-free, 1 mm Ca2+, 1.4 mm Ca2+, 1.8 mm Ca2+, 1.8 mm Ni2+ (without Ca2+), or 1.8 mm Mg2+ (without Ca2+), and the relative changes in the structural morphology were imaged. It should be mentioned that although the quantitative analysis for calcium-dependent conformational changes were performed on fully open channels and their closure when increasing the calcium"

This study evaluated the role for nitrosative stress in two animal models of type 1 diabetes: streptozotocin-diabetic mice and diabetic NOD mice. Control (C) and streptozotocin-diabetic (D) mice were treated with and without the potent peroxynitrite decomposition catalyst FP15 (5 mg kg(-1) d(-1)) for 1 wk after 8 wk without treatment. Sciatic nerve nitrotyrosine (a marker of peroxynitrite-induced injury) and poly(ADP-ribose) immunoreactivities were present in D and absent in C and D+FP15. FP15 treatment corrected sciatic motor and hind-limb digital sensory nerve conduction deficits and sciatic nerve energy state in D, without affecting those variables in C. Nerve glucose and sorbitol pathway intermediate concentrations were similarly elevated in D and D+FP15 vs C. In diabetic NOD mice, a 7-day treatment with either 1 or 3 mg kg(-1) d(-1) FP15 reversed increased tail-flick latency (a sign of reduced pain sensitivity); the effect of the higher dose was significant as early as 3 days after beginning of the treatment. In conclusion, nitrosative stress plays a major role in DN in, at least, type 1 diabetes. This provides the rationale for development of agents counteracting peroxynitrite formation and promoting peroxynitrite decomposition, and their evaluation in DN."
https://openalex.org/W2079673122,"Recent data investigating the role of the Smad anchor for receptor activation (SARA) in TGF-β signaling have suggested that it has a crucial function in both aiding the recruitment of Smad to the TGF-β receptor, and ensuring appropriate subcellular localization of the activated receptor-bound complex. The FYVE domain in SARA directs its localization to early endosomal compartments where it can interact with both the TGF-β receptors and Smads. However, the necessity of endocytosis in the TGF-β response remains controversial. We sought to examine the role of internalization in TGF-β/Smad signaling in human kidney mesangial cells. Using co-immunoprecipitation studies, we show that endogenous Smad2 interacts with SARA after TGF-β1 stimulation. Inhibition of clathrin-mediated internalization only slightly affects TGF-β1-stimulated association between SARA and Smad2, Smad2 phosphorylation, or Smad2 interaction with Smad4. However, endocytosis inhibition decreases TGF-β1-induced Smad2 nuclear translocation and thus abrogates Smad2-dependent transcriptional responses. The TGF-β1-stimulated association between SARA and Smad2 peaks at 30 min followed by separation of the complex components. However, under conditions of inhibited endocytosis, Smad2 remains bound to SARA for at least 6 h without a significant decline in associated levels. This lack of complex dissociation correlates with a lack of Smad2 nuclear accumulation and reduction of Smad2-dependent ARE-Luc reporter activity. Our data therefore suggest that endocytosis plays a critical role in TGF-β signaling in mesangial cells, and that internalization enhances the dissociation of Smad2 from the TGF-β receptor-SARA complex, allowing Smad2 to accumulate in the nucleus and modulate target gene transcription.

Sporn M.B. Sporn M.B. Roberts A.B. Peptide Growth Factors and Their Receptors. 95. Springer-Verlag, Heidelberg, Germany1990: 419-472Google Scholar). This diversity is likely caused by differential involvement of TGF-β downstream signaling mediators, and therefore understanding precise interactions among TGF-β signaling components is of critical importance. TGF-β signaling is initiated when ligand-bound TGF-β type II receptor (TβRII) binds to, and phosphorylates, the TGF-β type I receptor (TβRI) (2Wrana J.L. Attisano L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 235-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar, 3Piek E. Heldin C.H. ten Dijke P. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 2105-2124Crossref PubMed Scopus (736) Google Scholar, 4Shi Y. Massague J. Cell. 2003; 113: 685-700Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4693) Google Scholar). This phosphorylation, in the TβRI cytoplasmic GS region, leads to its activation and its ability to activate the receptor-regulated Smads (R-Smads), Smad2, and Smad3, by C-terminal serine phosphorylation. Once phosphorylated, the R-Smads form a heteromultimeric complex with the common mediator (Co)-Smad (Smad4) and accumulate in the nucleus to regulate transcriptional responses (2Wrana J.L. Attisano L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 235-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar, 3Piek E. Heldin C.H. ten Dijke P.

However, the seemingly simple initial delineation of the Smad signaling pathway has gained considerable complexity from the recent discovery of a number of additional factors that interact with the Smads and can regulate the signaling outcome. Among these interacting factors are those with anchoring or chaperone activity that aid in recruitment of R-Smads to the TGF-β receptor complex. Thus far, the best characterized of this type of Smad cofactor is SARA (Smad anchor for receptor activation). SARA contains both a Smad-binding domain (SBD), which has been shown to interact with Smad2 and Smad3 (5Wu G. Chen Y. Ozdamar B. Gyuricza C.A. Chong A. Wrana J.L. Massague J. Shi Y. Science. 2000; 287: 92-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar), and a C-terminal, TGF-β receptor complex-interacting region (6Tsukazaki T. Chiang T.A. Davison A.F. Attisano L. Wrana J.L. Cell. 1998; 95: 779-791Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (775) Google Scholar). SARA is therefore proposed to play a role in presenting R-Smads to the receptor for phosphorylation. Additionally, SARA, by virtue of its FYVE domain binding to phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PI3P), can interact with EEA1-positive, Rab 5-containing early endosomal compartments within the cell (6Tsukazaki T.

However, while it has been clearly demonstrated that activated TβRI and TβRII are internalized into SARA-containing EEA1 endosomes, controversy remains as to the requirement for SARA binding and endocytosis in transducing the TGF-β signal. Although some reports indicate that TGF-β-mediated, Smad2-dependent transcription is reduced by inhibition of endocytosis (9Hayes S. Chawla A. Corvera S. J.

Additionally, a recent report investigating the role of endocytosis in the signaling mediated by the TGF-β family member, activin, through the Alk4 receptor, suggests that internalization is not required for Smad2 phosphorylation or transcriptional activity of the TGF-β1/activin-responsive p3TP-Lux transcriptional activation (15Zhou Y.

This inconsistency is likely due, at least in part, to the fact that almost every study of the Smad2-SARA interaction has been performed using transformed cell lines and overexpressed Smad, SARA, or TGF-β family receptors. Because high levels of SARA have been shown to lead to the formation of large non-vesicular aggregates (7Itoh F. Divecha N. Brocks L. Oomen L. Janssen H. Clalfat J. Itoh S. ten Dijke P.

Cell. 1998; 95: 779-791Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (775) Google Scholar), we sought to examine the specificity, localization and necessity of the interaction between endogenous SARA and Smad for TGF-β responsiveness. We report here that endogenous SARA and Smad2 interact in response to TGF-β1 treatment. There is a requirement for endocytosis in Smad signaling in that inhibition of endocytic vesicle formation abrogates the TGF-β transcriptional response. Our data suggest that an internalization step, although dispensable for phosphorylation of Smad2 and its interaction with Smad4, may be required to allow dissociation of Smad2 from SARA followed by its nuclear accumulation and transcriptional activity.

The cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's F12 medium, supplemented with 20% heat-inactivated new-born calf serum (NBCS), glutamine, penicillin/streptomycin, sodium pyruvate, Hepes buffer, and 8 μg/ml insulin (Invitrogen Life Technologies) as described previously (18Schnaper H.W.

Mouse mammary gland epithelial cells (NMuMG) were purchased from ATCC. They were passaged in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 4.5 g/liter glucose, 10 μg/ml insulin, and 10% NBCS. Potassium Depletion—Cells were switched to 1% NBCS-containing media for 18–24 h prior to treatment. Media were then switched either to fresh 1% NBCS-containing media or to hypotonic media (50% Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 50% H20). After 10 min in hypotonic buffer, the cells were either switched to isotonic media without potassium (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl) or isotonic media containing 10 mm KCl. Cells were depleted for 30 min prior to TGF-β1 treatment, and then lysed in RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS) containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors (Sigma). After clarification by centrifugation at 18,000 × g, the protein content was determined by Bradford protein assay (Bio-Rad) and prepared for immunoprecipitation or Western blotting.

The cells were then disrupted by 15 strokes of a Dounce homogenizer, and centrifuged at 1,000 × g for 5 min to remove nuclei. The supernatant was removed and further centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 45 min. After centrifugation, the supernatant was saved as the cytosolic fraction. The pellet was resuspended in detergent-free buffer supplemented with 1% (final concentration) Triton X-100, sheared with a syringe, incubated for 30 min on ice, and centrifuged to remove insoluble material. This supernatant represents the soluble membrane fraction. The nuclei were resuspended in RIPA buffer, syringe-sheared, incubated for 30 min on ice, and centrifuged to remove insoluble material. This fraction represents the nuclear fraction. Protein concentration for each fraction was determined by Bradford protein assay. Immunoprecipitation and Western Blot—300–600 μg of protein from total cell lysates were diluted in the same final volume of RIPA buffer containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors. Anti-SARA (N-20) or anti-Smad4 (H-552) antibody was added at a final concentration of 2 μg. Immunoprecipitations and Western blotting were performed as described previously (19Runyan C.E.

The following day, medium was changed to 1 ml per well 1% NBCS-containing medium and transfected as described previously (20Runyan C.E. Schnaper H.W. Poncelet A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 2632-2639Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar) using FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science, Indianapolis, IN). Cells were treated for 18–24 h with control vehicle or TGF-β1 then lysed with reporter lysis buffer, and assayed for luciferase activity and also for β-galactosidase activity to correct for transfection efficiency. Immunocytochemistry—Cells were grown to 70% confluence on gelatin-coated glass coverslips in 6-well dishes. For determination of Smad nuclear translocation, cells were transfected with wild type- or K44A-dynamin using FuGENE 6 reagent (as described above). To confirm dynamin effectiveness cells were co-transfected with HA-tagged TβRI along with either wild type or K44A-dynamin. To determine SARA subcellular localization and to confirm inhibition of endocytosis, cells were serum deprived and potassium depleted as described above. Cells were then either treated with TGF-β1 for various time points, or labeled for 30 min with Alexa transferrin 594 (50 μg/ml). Coverslips were prepared for immunocytochemistry by fixing in 3.7% formaldehyde for 15 min, followed by permeabilization with ice-cold 0.5% Triton X-100 for 5 min, and blocking in 3% bovine serum albumin-phosphate-buffered saline for 20 min. Antibody solutions were layered onto coverslips at a final concentration of 2 μg/ml for Smad (H-2) or 4 μg/ml for HA (Y-11), SARA (H-300), EEA1 (N-19), or TβRI (V-22) and incubated in a humidified chamber for 2 h at 37 °C, followed by three 5-min washes in phosphate-buffered saline. The coverslips were then incubated in secondary antibody for 30–60 min with 2.5 μg/ml either chicken anti-goat-rhodamine, chicken anti-mouse-FITC, chicken anti-rabbit-FITC, or AlexaFluor594 goat anti-rabbit secondary antibodies. To rule out background fluorescence, negative controls were incubated with secondary antibodies only. After three 5-min washes, cover slips were mounted onto glass slides, and images were scanned using a Zeiss LSM510 laser scanning confocal microscope. TGF-β1 Stimulates Smad2 and Smad3 Association with SARA—There are relatively few examples of SARA interaction with R-Smads (5Wu G. Chen Y. Ozdamar B. Gyuricza C.A. Chong A. Wrana J.L. Massague J.

Davison A.F. Attisano L. Wrana J.L. Cell. 1998; 95: 779-791Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (775) Google Scholar), and none in human mesangial cells. We therefore first sought to examine the Smad2-SARA interaction in serum-deprived mesangial cells treated with 1 ng/ml (40 pm) TGF-β1 for various time periods. After immunoprecipitation with anti-SARA antibody, the immunoprecipitated complexes were analyzed by Western blot with an antibody that recognizes both Smad2 and Smad3. As shown in Fig. 1A, there is little Smad2 or Smad3 detected in association with SARA in the absence of treatment. However, with 30 min of TGF-β1 stimulation, there is a marked increase in co-immunoprecipitated Smad2. This interaction is apparent within 5 min (data not shown), peaks at 30 min, and continues to be somewhat increased over basal levels 24 h after treatment. Increased association is not caused by changes in total cellular SARA (1A) or Smad2 (1B) expression levels, which do not vary throughout 24 h of treatment with TGF-β1. Interestingly, while Smad3 is strongly expressed in mesangial cells (Fig. 1B, lower panel), there is only a slight band revealed for Smad3-associated SARA (Fig. 1A). TGF-β1 activates Smad2 through receptor-mediated C-terminal phosphorylation, and the pattern of TGF-β1-induced Smad2-SARA association parallels that of Smad2 phosphorylation as detected using an antibody specific for phosphoserine 465/467 (Fig. 1B). PDGF, which does not induce the phosphorylation of Smad2 (Fig. 1B and Ref. 20Runyan C.E. Schnaper H.W. Poncelet A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 2632-2639Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar), does not stimulate its association with SARA (Fig. 1A). The TGF-β1-induced association between SARA and Smad2 does not appear to be restricted to mesangial cells, as we detect an increased association after 30 min TGF-β1 treatment of an unrelated mouse mammary gland epithelial cell line (NMuMg) (Fig. 1C). Clathrin-mediated Endocytosis Is Required for Smad2-dependent Transcriptional Activity—Because SARA has been shown to associate with EEA1-positive early endosomal compartments (7Itoh F. Divecha N. Brocks L. Oomen L. Janssen H. Clalfat J. Itoh S. ten Dijke P. Genes to Cells. 2002; 7: 321-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), and its mislocalization has been suggested to disrupt Smad2 signaling, we sought to determine whether human mesangial cells require endocytosis to signal through Smad2 after TGF-β1 stimulation. We performed transient transfection of mesangial cells with the Smad2-specific ARE-Luc reporter construct along with a FAST-2 expression construct and either wild-type or K44A mutant dynamin. This K44A mutant of dynamin does not allow excision of vesicles from the cell membrane and thereby blocks clathrin-mediated endocytosis (16Damke H. Baba T. Warnock D.E. Schmid S.L. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 915-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (1031) Google Scholar). Whereas wild-type dynamin does not affect the TGF-β1 induction of ARE-Luc, this activation was significantly inhibited in the presence of the dynamin mutant (Fig. 2A), confirming a role for internalization in Smad2 transcriptional activity. Because blocking the function of dynamin would also block caveolar excision from the membrane (23Henley J.R. Krueger W.A. Oswald B.J. McNiven M.A. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 85-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar), and because lipid raft/caveolar internalization may mediate the ubiquitin-dependent degradation of the TβR (24Di Guglielmo G.M. Le Roy C. Goodfellow A.F. Wrana J.L. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 410-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (918) Google Scholar), we sought to rule out the possibility of caveolar compartmentalization by using nystatin to disrupt cellular cholesterol and thereby interfere with caveolae formation (25Simons K. Toomre D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 1: 31-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (5059) Google Scholar). Nystatin treatment has only a minimal inhibitory effect in comparison to that of the K44A-dynamin mutant (Fig. 2B). Therefore the internalization requirement in TGF-β1-mediated Smad2 signaling is likely specific to a non-caveolar, clathrin-mediated endocytic event. Inhibition of Endocytosis Abrogates TGF-β1-stimulated Nuclear Translocation of Smad2—Having established that endocytosis is required for Smad2 signaling, we sought to further investigate the specific role of internalization after TGF-β receptor stimulation. To determine whether endocytosis is required for nuclear Smad2 accumulation, we performed cell fractionation experiments under conditions of cellular potassium depletion to inhibit clathrin-coated pit formation (26Larkin J.M. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Anderson G.W. Cell. 1983; 33: 273-285Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). In agreement with other reports (9Hayes S. Chawla A. Corvera S. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 1239-1249Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar, 11Penheiter S.G. Mitchell H. Garamszegi N. Edens M. Dore J.J.E. Leof E.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 4750-4759Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), under conditions of inhibited endocytosis, the level of nuclear Smad2 accumulation in response to TGF-β1 is decreased compared with that of potassium control conditions (Fig. 3A). This is confirmed by immunocytochemical analysis for intracellular localization of Smad2. Whereas there is a striking increase in detection of Smad in the nucleus of TGF-β1 treated cells under potassium control conditions (Fig. 3B compare panels b to a), potassium depletion completely abrogates this response (Fig. 3B, panels c and d). To ensure that the depletion of intracellular potassium had, in fact, reduced vesicle formation and thus endosomal association of SARA, we performed immunocytochemical analysis to detect SARA localization under potassium-depleted versus potassium-containing conditions. In control conditions, SARA shows the distinct punctuate staining pattern associated with endosomal localization (Fig. 4A, left panel). As expected (6Tsukazaki T. Chiang T.A. Davison A.F. Attisano L. Wrana J.L. Cell. 1998; 95: 779-791Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (775) Google Scholar, 7Itoh F. Divecha N. Brocks L. Oomen L. Janssen H. Clalfat J. Itoh S. ten Dijke P.

Corvera S. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 1239-1249Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar), these punctuate structures also contain the early endosomal marker EEA1 (27Mitchell H. Choudhury A. Pagano R.E. Leof E.B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 4166-4178Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). However, in potassium-depleted cells SARA immunostaining becomes faint and diffuse throughout the cell and no longer shows extensive co-localization with EEA1 (Fig. 4A, right panel). To confirm that the levels of SARA expression were not altered by potassium depletion, we performed Western blot analysis of SARA from cells treated with TGF-β1 for various duration in either potassium-control or potassium-depleted conditions. As shown in Fig. 4B, throughout 6 h of treatment, there are no significant changes in the levels of SARA total protein expression. To further confirm that potassium depletion is inhibiting endosomal internalization, we treated the cells with fluorescently tagged transferrin (AF-tf594). Transferrin is known to internalize via clathrin-mediated endocytosis (28Mayor S. Presley J.F. Maxfield F.R. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 1257-1269Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4C, top panel, cells incubated with AF-tf594 for 30 min show a punctate fluorescence. In contrast, in potassium-depleted conditions (4C, bottom panel) there is a lack of internalized AF-tf594. These results suggest that our potassium depletion conditions are effectively blocking endocytic internalization. However, there remains the possibility that the relatively nonspecific conditions of potassium depletion may be introducing alternate effects on the cells that disrupt the ability of Smad2 to translocate to the nucleus. Therefore, we used the K44A-dynamin mutant as an alternative means to block endocytic internalization. Cells were transfected with either HA-tagged wt-dynamin or K44A-dynamin and stained for Smad and HA. As shown in Fig. 5A, K44A-dynamin decreases TGF-β1-induced nuclear accumulation of Smad2, whereas wild-type dynamin-expressing cells respond with nuclear accumulation similar to untransfected neighboring cells. This inhibitory effect of K44A-dynamin on translocation is seen in every transfected cell at both an early time point (Fig. 5A, panels a–d), corresponding to peak Smad2 phosphorylation (Fig. 1B) as well as at a longer duration of treatment of 6 h (Fig. 5A, e–h). This confirms the effect seen with potassium depletion in that Smad nuclear translocation requires endocytic internalization. To ensure K44A-dynamin was inhibiting internalization of TβR in human mesangial cells as previously reported in other cell types (9Hayes S. Chawla A. Corvera S. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 1239-1249Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar, 13Lu Z. Murray J.T. Luo W. Li H. Wu X. Xu H. Backer J.M. Chen Y.G. J. Biol.

As shown in Fig. 5B, there is TβRI internalization and co-localization with EEA1 in cells transfected with wt-dynamin (Fig. 5B, left panel), but expression of TβRI is predominantly detected at the cell periphery in cells expressing K44A-dynanim (Fig. 5B, right panel).Fig. 4SARA is mislocalized under conditions of inhibited endocytosis.

The role of α-synuclein as a potential target of intracellular oxidants has been demonstrated by the identification of posttranslational modifications of synuclein within intracellular aggregates that accumulate in Parkinson's disease brains, as well as the ability of a number of oxidative insults to induce synuclein oligomerization. The relationship between these relatively small soluble oligomers, potentially neurotoxic synuclein protofibrils, and synuclein filaments remains unclear. We have found that metal-catalyzed oxidation of α-synuclein inhibited formation of synuclein filaments with a concomitant accumulation of β sheet-rich oligomers that may represent synuclein protofibrils. Similar results with a number of oxidative and enzymatic treatments suggest that the covalent association of synuclein into higher molecular mass oligomers/protofibrils represents an alternate pathway from filament formation and renders synuclein less prone to proteasomal degradation.

The detection of biochemical landmarks of oxidative stress in post-mortem tissues yields clues as to the initiating event(s) (1Jenner P. Olanow C.W. Ann.

Ann. Neurol. 2003; 53: 26-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (1540) Google Scholar). The major pathological findings in PD, which involve the selective demise of neurons of the substantia nigra pars compacta, have been attributed largely to the unique sensitivity of these dopamine-containing neurons to impairments in mitochondrial complex I activity (4Dawson T.M.

One common feature of these toxins is their ability to induce oxidative damage via the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) produced by mitochondrial respiratory chain dysfunction (4Dawson T.M. Dawson V.L. Science. 2003; 302: 819-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (1314) Google Scholar). Inherent in the toxicity due to the generation of ROS is the fundamental role of transition metals, principally iron and copper, in catalyzing ROS formation via their ability to undergo interconversion between oxidized and reduced states (11Netto L.E.

In fact, considerable evidence suggests that much of the toxicity of the enzymatically generated superoxide radical anion and hydrogen peroxide is because of their reaction with reduced iron or copper ions to generate the highly reactive hydroxyl radical via iron-catalyzed Haber-Weiss and Fenton reactions (15Halliwell B.

Olanow C.W. Ann. Neurol. 2003; 53: 73-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). Whether metalcatalyzed oxidative processes are causative in Lewy body formation or accumulate subsequent to defects in protein and lipid turnover remains unknown. Given the potential role of oxidative stress in the etiology of PD, we sought to investigate the role that oxidation plays in the relationship between synuclein oligomers, protofibrils, and filaments. We found that a model metal-catalyzed oxidation (MCO) system consisting of a redox active metal (iron or copper), oxygen, and a reducing agent to recycle the oxidized metal (57Kim K. Rhee S.G. Stadtman E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 15394-15397Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), enhanced the oxidation of α-synuclein over previously used MCO systems. Under these conditions, production of synuclein oligomers and protofibrils was enhanced, whereas synuclein filaments were not produced. Rather, altering oxidative stress levels could modulate the conversion between synuclein protofibrils and filaments. This raises the possibility that synuclein oxidation/oligomerization/protofibril formation represents a divergent pathway from fibril assembly. Failure to efficiently degrade oxidized synuclein by the proteasome underlies the potential pathological consequences of these structural modifications. Reagents—Human wild type α-synuclein was expressed in bacteria and purified as described (58Jakes R. Spillantini M.G. Goedert M.

MCO of α-Synuclein—Recombinant α-synuclein was incubated at the indicated concentrations in 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, for 16–18 h at 37 °C, unless otherwise indicated. Where indicated, incubations included iron(III) chloride or copper(II) sulfate, hydrogen peroxide, DTT, and metal chelators at the indicated concentrations. Variability was observed in the effectiveness of different lots of DTT to result in synuclein oxidation/oligomerization, which was likely because of the presence of contaminating metals present in the various solutions. The addition of neutralized solutions derived from a low pH elution of Chelex 100-treated DTT stock solutions demonstrated that the likely primary source of contaminating trace metal was the DTT itself. Anaerobic conditions were created by exposing all solutions to an anoxic atmosphere containing 95% N2, 5% H2 for 3 h at room temperature prior to incubation. Dr. Tracey Rouault (Cell Biology and Metabolism Branch, NICHD, National Institutes of Health) generously provided the anoxic chamber. After the reactions, SDS sample buffer was added to the samples, which were then boiled for 5 min then loaded onto precast 10–20% Tris-tricine gels for SDS-PAGE. No differences were detected whether the synuclein samples were boiled or not, or whether the SDS sample buffer contained 100 mm DTT or not (except when using the thiol-reducible cross-linker DSP, where DTT was omitted). Synuclein was detected by immunoblotting after transfer to nitrocellulose membranes (Protran, 0.2 μm, Schleicher & Schuell), or by silver staining, according to the manufacturer's instruction (Silver Stain Plus, Bio-Rad). In Vitro Assembly of Synuclein Filaments, Ultrastructural and Biochemical Analysis—Purified recombinant synuclein was concentrated to ∼ 10 mg/ml (Centriprep 10,000 MWCO), dialyzed overnight against phosphate-buffered saline (PBS (Invitrogen), 1 mm K2HPO4, 155 mm NaCl, 3 mm Na2HPO4, pH 7.4), and incubated at a concentration of 3 mg/ml (200 μm) for up to 72 h at 37 °C with shaking (1400 rpm; Eppendorf Thermomixer R). 100 μm Fe(III)/10 mm DTT or 10 mm deferoxamine were included where indicated. For incubations using preformed synuclein “seeds”, synuclein filaments generated from 72 h incubations were briefly sonicated (5 s) and added to incubations at a 1:100 dilution (based on total synuclein concentration). We found that sonication dramatically reduced the lag time required to generate new synuclein filaments over unsonicated preformed filament seeds (62Wood S.J. Wypych J. Steavenson S. Louis J.C. Citron M. Biere A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19509-19512Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar), and under these conditions incubations were routinely performed for 16–20 h. For electron microscopy, aliquots (1 μl) were taken, diluted 2-fold in water, placed on 1% pioloform and copper-coated grids, and negatively stained with 1% uranyl acetate. Filaments and other non-filamentous structures were observed on a JEOL-100 transmission electron microscope at an accelerating voltage of 80 keV. For thioflavin T fluorescence measurements, 5-μl aliquots from the synuclein incubations were added to 1 ml of a solution containing 10 μm thioflavin T (prepared from a 100 μm filtered stock solution in water) in 90 mm glycine-NaOH, pH 8.5 (the resulting synuclein concentration was 1 μm, and under oxidizing conditions, the final Fe(III) concentration was 0.5 μm). Fluorescence measurements were performed in a 1-cm cuvette (Uvette, 220–1600 nm, Eppendorf) with the excitation at 440 nm (slit width 4 nm) and emission scan 450–600 nm (slit width 4 nm) and analyzed with Felix fluorescence analysis software (Photon Technology International), courtesy of Paul Smith and Alec Eidsath, Instrumentation Research and Development Resource (OD), National Institutes of Health. The graphs are representative of at least three independent experiments from at least two separate synuclein preparations. For analysis of synuclein protofibrils, insoluble fibrils were removed by centrifugation (16,000 × g for 10 min), and the supernatants (200-μl volume) were subjected to size exclusion chromatography using a Superdex HR200 column (Amersham Biosciences) with PBS containing 0.02% sodium azide as the mobile phase and a flow rate of 0.4 ml/min. The column eluate was monitored at 280 nm (Waters 2487). An on-line multi-angle light scattering detection system (Wyatt Technology Dawn EOS) was used to determine the masses of the eluting species. Wyatt Technology Astra software was used for the data analysis. Purification of Synuclein Oligomers—Synuclein oligomers generated by treating 3 mg/ml synuclein at 37 °C overnight with 100 μm Fe(III)/10 mm DTT were loaded (0.2 ml) onto a Superose 6 HR 10/30 gel filtration column (Amersham Biosciences) using 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, 100 mm KCl as the mobile phase and a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. We found this column gave a slightly better separation of oligomeric from monomeric synuclein compared with Superdex 200. Fractions containing synuclein oligomers were concentrated by Centricon (Amicon) centrifugal filter devices or by reverse osmosis with Slide-A-Lyzer dialysis cassettes (10,000 MWCO) and concentrating solution (Pierce), which resulted in less loss of material presumably because of binding of oligomers to the filters. CD Spectroscopy—Far-UV CD spectra of purified monomeric (70 μm) and oligomeric synuclein (20 μm) were collected at 20 °C on a Jasco J-720 spectropolarimeter equipped with a temperature controller using a 0.02-cm path length cell. Data were collected at 1 nm intervals with a response time of 1 s/measurement at a scan speed of 10–20 nm/min. The final spectrum was obtained by subtracting the background from the mean of four individual scans. Analysis of Synuclein Fibrillization by Centrifugal Sedimentation— Untreated synuclein or seeded assembly reactions were centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 10 min. Supernatants and pellets were separated, pellets were washed with 0.5 ml of PBS, repelleted, and diluted to the same volume as the supernatants. SDS sample buffer was added to equal sample volumes, and the samples were heated to 100 °C for 5 min. Synuclein proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with anti-synuclein antibodies. For seeded reactions, up to 10 μg of total protein was loaded/lane to visualize the seed, which was added at a 1:100 dilution (100 ng). 20 S Prote"
https://openalex.org/W1971396843,"Skeletal muscle is a major insulin target tissue and has a prominent role in the control of body amino acid economy, being the principal store of free and protein-bound amino acids and a dominant locus for amino acid metabolism. Interplay between diverse stimuli (e.g., hormonal/nutritional/mechanical) modulates muscle insulin action to serve physiological need through the action of factors such as intramuscular signaling molecules. Ceramide, a product of sphingolipid metabolism and cytokine signaling, has a potent contra-insulin action with respect to the transport and deposition of glucose in skeletal muscle, although ceramide effects on muscle amino acid turnover have not previously been documented. Here, membrane permeant C2-ceramide is shown to attenuate the basal and insulin-stimulated activity of the Na+-dependent System A amino acid transporter in rat muscle cells (L6 myotubes) by depletion of the plasma membrane abundance of SNAT2 (a System A isoform). Concomitant with transporter down-regulation, ceramide diminished both intramyocellular amino acid abundance and the phosphorylation of translation regulators lying downstream of mTOR. The physiological outcome of ceramide signaling in this instance is a marked reduction in cellular protein synthesis, a result that is likely to represent an important component of the processes leading to muscle wasting in catabolic conditions."

In the present study, we investigated the protective role of local kallikrein gene delivery in ischemia/reperfusion-induced cardiomyocyte apoptosis and its signaling mechanisms in promoting cardiomyocyte survival. Adenovirus carrying the human tissue kallikrein gene was delivered locally into the heart using a catheter-based technique. Expression and localization of recombinant human kallikrein in rat myocardium after gene transfer were determined immunohistochemically. Kallikrein gene delivery markedly reduced reperfusion-induced cardiomyocyte apoptosis identified by both in situ nick end-labeling and DNA fragmentation. Delivery of the kallikrein gene increased phosphorylation of Src, Akt, glycogen synthase kinase (GSK)-3β, and Bad(Ser-136) but reduced caspase-3 activation in rat myocardium after reperfusion. The protective effect of kallikrein on apoptosis and its signaling mediators was blocked by icatibant and dominant-negative Akt, indicating a kinin B2 receptor-Akt-mediated event. Similarly, kinin or transduction of kallikrein in cultured cardiomyocytes promoted cell viability and attenuated apoptosis induced by hypoxia/reoxygenation. The effect of kallikrein on cardiomyocyte survival was blocked by dominant-negative Akt and a constitutively active mutant of GSK-3β, but it was facilitated by constitutively active Akt, catalytically inactive GSK-3β, lithium, and caspase-3 inhibitor. Moreover, kallikrein promoted Bad·14-3-3θ complex formation and inhibited Akt-GSK-3β-dependent activation of caspase-3, whereas caspase-3 administration caused reduction of the Bad·14-3-3θ complex, indicating an interaction between Akt-GSK-caspase-3 and Akt-Bad·14-3-3 signaling pathways.

Because the capacity of cell proliferation in cardiomyocytes is limited, even a small loss of cardiomyocytes resulting from apoptosis is likely to cause reduced cardiac function and the development of heart failure.

Chao L. Chao J. Hypertension. 2004; 43: 452-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Activation of Akt triggers downstream signaling pathways such as GSK-3 phosphorylation in a variety of cell lines (7Roberts M.S. Woods A.J. Dale T.C. Van Der Sluijs P. Norman J.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 1505-1515Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). GSK activity is inactivated by Akt-induced phosphorylation at serine 21 (α isoform) and serine 9 (β isoform), leading to inhibition of apoptosis in insulin-mediated signal transduction (8Stoica B.A. Movsesyan V.A.

Apoptosis can be induced by overexpression of catalytically active GSK-3 and prevented by dominant-negative GSK-3 (10Kim H.S. Skurk C. Thomas S.R. Bialik A. Suhara T. Kureishi Y. Birnbaum M. Keaney Jr., J.F. Walsh K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 41888-41896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Under ischemic preconditioning, GSK-3β phosphorylation increases through a PI 3-kinase-Akt-dependent pathway, suggesting that inhibition of GSK-3β is protective in myocardial ischemia (11Tong H. Imahashi K. Steenbergen C. Murphy E. Circ. Res. 2002; 90: 377-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). Moreover, several studies reported that GSK-3β exerted its effect via activation of caspase-3 (8Stoica B.A. Movsesyan V.A. Lea IV, P.M. Faden A.I. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2003; 22: 365-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 12Song L. Sarno P.D. Jope R.S. J. Biol.

Brain Res. 2001; 919: 106-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Taken together, these studies support a role for GSK-3β in regulating cardiomyocyte apoptosis. Akt has also been shown to play an important role in regulating Bcl-2 family members and thus cell fate. Akt phosphorylates Bad, thereby inhibiting its proapoptotic function, which may partly account for its antiapoptotic effect (8Stoica B.A. Movsesyan V.A. Lea IV, P.M. Faden A.I. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2003; 22: 365-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 14Somervaille T.C. Linch D.C. Khwaja A. Blood. 2001; 98: 1374-13781Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Bad is known to bind to Bcl-xL in mitochondria and promote apoptosis, whereas phosphorylation of Bad by Akt results in binding to 14-3-3 proteins and promotes the survival of neurons and fibroblasts (8Stoica B.A. Movsesyan V.A. Lea IV, P.M. Faden A.I. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2003; 22: 365-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 15Shimamura H. Terada Y. Okado T. Tanaka H. Inoshita S. Sasaki S. J. Am. Soc.

Neurochem. 2003; 86: 460-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). These studies suggest a potential role of Akt-Bad·14-3-3 signaling in promoting cell survival. However, the relationship between GSK-3β-caspase-3 and Bad·14-3-3 in cardiomyocyte apoptosis has not been examined. We hypothesized that interactions of the proapoptotic members of Bcl-2 family with 14-3-3 may contribute greatly to the regulation of cardiomyocyte fate after I/R injury and that GSK-3β-caspase-3 facilitates these signaling effects.The tissue kallikrein/kinin system has been implicated in protection against cardiac remodeling (18Agata J. Chao L. Chao J. Hypertension. 2002; 40: 653-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 19Chao J. Zhang J.J. Lin K.F. Chao L. Hum.

Physiol. 2001; 281: R1059-R1070Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our previous study showed that systemic delivery of the kallikrein gene inhibited I/R-induced myocardial injury, which was accompanied by increased kinin and cGMP levels (22Yoshida H. Zhang J.J. Chao L. Chao J. Hypertension. 2000; 35: 25-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Similarly, adrenomedullin gene transfer also increased cardiac cGMP levels after I/R (23Kato K. Yin H. Agata J. Chao L. Chao J. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 285: H1506-H1514PubMed Google Scholar). cGMP is an indicator of nitric oxide formation, and these results indicate that the nitric oxide-cGMP signaling cascade may serve as the common signaling cascade for cardio-protective stimuli in the injured myocardium. In this study, we employed a catheter-based gene delivery technique to investigate the role and signaling mechanisms by which kallikrein/kinin inhibits myocardial apoptosis in an acute I/R rat model and in primary cardiomyocytes. Our results show that kallikrein/kinin protects against cardiomyocyte apoptosis via activation of Akt-Bad·14-3-3 and Akt-GSK-3-caspase-3 signaling pathways. We also observed a novel mechanism in which caspase-3 directly disrupts the Bad·14-3-3 complex in cardiomyocytes, establishing a link between these two pathways.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Monoclonal anti-α-actinin sarcomeric, lithium chloride, and bisbenzimide (Hoechst 33342) were purchased from Sigma. Z-VAD(OMe)-CH2F was purchased from Enzyme System Products (Livermore, CA). Recombinant caspase-3 was from purchased Calbiochem. Hoe140 was a gift from Hoechst Marion Russell Co. (Frankfurt, Germany). LY294002, anti-c-Src, anti-v-Src, anti-Akt, anti-phospho-Akt, anti-Bad, anti-phospho-Bad(Ser-136), anti-phospho-GSK-3β(Ser-9), anti-GSK-3β, anti-cleaved caspase-3, and anti-Bcl-xL were from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). Polyclonal anti-14-3-3θ was from Chemicon (Temecula, CA).Preparation of Replication-deficient Adenoviral Vectors—Adenoviral vector harboring the human tissue kallikrein cDNA (Ad.CMV-TK) under the control of the cytomegalovirus (CMV) enhancer/promoter or adenoviral vector alone (Ad.Null) were constructed and prepared as described previously (23Kato K. Yin H. Agata J. Chao L. Chao J. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 285: H1506-H1514PubMed Google Scholar). Adenoviruses containing the dominant-negative mutant of Akt (Ad.DN-Akt), constitutively active Akt (Ad.Myr-Akt), catalytically inactive GSK-3β (Ad.GSK3β-KM) and constitutively active mutant of GSK-3β (Ad.GSK3β-S9A) were kindly provided by Dr. Kenneth Walsh, St. Elizabeth's Medical Center in Boston.Catheter-based Gene Delivery in Rat Myocardium and Immunological Evidence—Wistar rats (male, 250–280 g, Harlan, Indianapolis, IN) were employed in this study. The study complied with the standards for care and use of animal subjects as stated in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (National Academy of Sciences, Bethesda, MD). Five days before coronary occlusion, an adenoviral gene was delivered using a catheter-based strategy as described previously (24Del Monte F. Butler K. Boecker W. Gwathmey J.K. Hajjar R.J. Physiol. Genom. 2002; 9: 49-56Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Nozato T. Ito H. Watanabe M. Ono Y. Adachi S. Tanaka H. Hiroe M. Sunamori M. Marum F. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 2001; 33: 1493-1504Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Briefly, rats were anesthetized, intubated, and mechanically ventilated before surgery. The chest was entered via a left intercostals approach. A 24-gauge catheter (BD Biosciences) containing 300 μl of virus solution (2 × 1010 plaque-forming units/ml in PBS) was advanced from the apex of the left ventricle to the aortic root. The aorta and pulmonary trunk were clamped distal to the site of the catheter, and the solution was injected. The clamp was maintained for 20 s. After injection, the exposed heart was monitored for 5 min for resumption of normal sinus rhythm. The chest incision was then closed after removal of air and blood, and the animals were allowed to recover. Expression and localization of TK in rat ventricles after gene delivery were identified immunohistochemically by antibody to TK. Kallikrein levels in rat heart were determined using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay specific for human tissue kallikrein for detection of active kallikrein. TK standard ranges from 0.4 to 25 ng/ml.In Vivo Hemodynamics Measurements—To eliminate the hemodynamic effects of TK, we measured hemodynamic parameters before and 1 and 5 days after adenovirus solution was injection. Rats were underwent left ventricular catheterization via left common carotid artery by a 2.5 French micromanometer (Millar Instruments, Houston, TX) advanced into the left ventricle cavity. Heart rate, Mean arterial pressure, and ±left ventricle dP/dt (mm Hg/sec) were recorded and analyzed by a polygraph system (BIOPAC, Santa Barbara, CA). Cardiac output was measured by injection of microspheres for 10 s, collection of blood for 10 s before injection, and continued for a total time of 90 s at 0.68 ml/min. Cardiac output was calculated as described previously (26Dobrzynski E. Montanari D. Agata J. Zhu J. Chao J. Chao L. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283: E1291-E1298Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar).Acute Myocardial I/R Model—Acute myocardial I/R models were established 5 days after gene delivery. Rats were anesthetized, intubated, and mechanically ventilated. A thoracotomy was performed via the fourth intercostal space, and the heart was exposed. An electrocardiographic monitor was then connected. A 6-0 polypropylene suture (Ethicon, Somerville, NJ) was passed loosely around the left anterior descending coronary artery near its origin. Once hemodynamics were stabilized, left anterior descending occlusion was performed by tightening the suture loop for 30 min. Acute myocardial ischemia was deemed successful on the basis of regional cyanosis of the myocardial surface distal to the suture, accompanied by elevation of the ST segment on electrocardiogram. The loop was then loosened and reperfusion was identified on the basis of return of the original color, accompanied by obvious ST segment change. At the end of reperfusion period, the ischemic regions were then removed for further analysis.Animals were randomly divided into eight groups. In the sham groups, the chest was opened and injected with saline (n = 5), Ad.Null (n = 7), or Ad.CMV-TK (n = 6). The I/R-injured rats were divided into five groups. Control group (n = 6) was also injected with saline, the second group received Ad.Null (n = 6), and the third group received Ad.CMV-TK (n = 7) delivery. The fourth group received Ad.CMV-TK together with administration of kinin B2 antagonist, icatibant, delivered intraperitoneally by an osmotic minipump (Alza, Palo Alto, CA) at 1 μmol/kg of body weight/day (n = 6). The fifth group was injected with Ad.DN-Akt followed by Ad.CMV-TK via the same catheter (n = 6).Detection of Apoptosis in Situ and DNA Laddering—DNA fragmentation was determined using a terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay in 4-μm-thick paraffin-embedded sections as described previously (22Yoshida H. Zhang J.J. Chao L. Chao J. Hypertension. 2000; 35: 25-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The procedure was performed using an in situ cell death detection kit (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instructions. TUNEL-positive cardiomyocytes in the ischemic myocardium were carefully distinguished from TUNEL-positive noncardiomyocytes and evaluated under double-blinded conditions. The ratio of TUNEL-positive cardiomyocytes to the total number of cardiomyocytes was calculated.Fresh ischemic and nonischemic myocardium (100 mg) was minced and homogenized in 600 μl of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 100 mm EDTA, 100 mm NaCl, 1% SDS, pH 7.4). Tissues were digested with 100 μg/ml proteinase K (Invitrogen) at 55 °C overnight followed by centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 15 min. After incubation, tissues were precipitated and centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 5 min. Supernatants containing DNA were precipitated with isopropyl alcohol. After centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 5 min, the resulting DNA pellets were washed with 75% ethanol and dissolved in DNA hydration solution and measured at 260 nm by spectrophotometry. 10 μg of DNA was loaded onto 1.2% agarose gel containing 0.5 μg/ml ethidium bromide. DNA electrophoresis was carried out at 80 V for 1.5 h. DNA ladders, an indicator of tissue apoptotic nucleosomal DNA fragmentation, were visualized under ultraviolet light and photographed.Primary Cardiomyocyte Culture and Hypoxia/Reoxygenation (H/R)— Cardiomyocytes were isolated from the hearts of 2–3-day-old Wistar rats. The ventricles were cut into four equal parts and digested enzymatically through multiple rounds in 0.05% pancreatin (Sigma) and 84 units/ml collagenase (Sigma) in a balanced salt solution. The cells were centrifuged at 800 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C and resuspended in F-12 Nutrient Mixture (Invitrogen). Afterward, the cells were differentially plated for 2 h to remove contaminating nonmyocytes. The enriched cardiomyocyte fractions were then cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and F-12 (Invitrogen) medium with 10% fetal bovine serum. Cardiomyocyte origin was confirmed immunocytochemically using antibody to α-actinin sarcomeric (Sigma).Cultured cells were growth arrested for 18 h at 37 °C before the experiments. Cells were transduced with Ad.CMV-TK, Ad.Null, Ad-.Myr-Akt, Ad.DN-Akt, Ad.GSK3β-KM, or Ad.GSK3β-S9A at m.o.i. 50 for 12 h followed by 12-h hypoxia (95% N2 and 5% CO2) and 24-h reoxygenation (95% O2 and 5% CO2). Prior to H/R, myocytes were also treated with GSK-3β inhibitor 20 mm LiCl for 30 min or caspase-3 inhibitor 100 μm Z-VAD for 60-min. Expression and localization of human kallikrein in cardiomyocytes after Ad.CMV-TK transduction were identified immunocytochemically using a rabbit anti-kallikrein antibody. Apoptotic cardiomyocytes were identified in cells (fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde) by or Hoechst 33342 staining (27Nebigil C.G. Etienne N. Messaddeq N. Maroteaux L. FASEB J. 2003; 17: 1373-1375Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 28Craig R. Wagner M. McCardle T. Craig A.G. Glembotski C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37621-37629Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The positive cells were determined by counting 500–800 cardiac myocytes in six randomly chosen fields. Cell viability was determined by trypan blue eliminating assay.GSK-3β Kinase and Caspase-3 Activity Assay—Control and injured ventricular tissues were pulverized under liquid nitrogen and homogenized in ice-cold lysis buffer as described previously (29Haq S. Choukroun G. Kang Z.B. Ranu H. Matsui T. Rosenzweig A. Molkentin J.D. Alessandrini A. Woodgett J. Hajjar R. Michael A. Force T. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 117-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). For GSK-3β activity assay, 10 μg of protein from cardiac tissue or cell extracts was incubated at 37 °C for 30 min with the reaction buffer (8 mm MOPS, 0.2 mm EDTA, 10 mm magnesium acetate), 62.5 μm GSK-3β substrate peptide (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY) and 1 μCi/10 μl [γ-32P]ATP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Samples were transferred to P-81 paper and washed three times with 0.75% phosphoric acid followed by a final rinse with acetone. Radioactivity was measured in a scintillation counter. Caspase-3 activity in lysates was determined using a fluorometric caspase-3 assay kit (Oncogene, San Diego, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Reaction was monitored by a blue to green shift in fluorescence upon cleavage of the 7-amino-4-trifluoromethylcoumarin. Samples were read with a fluorescence reader (PerkinElmer Life Sciences).Immunoprecipitation and Western Blot Analysis—Heart tissues were homogenized, and cultured cardiomyocytes were harvested in the extraction buffer (10 mmol/liter Tris, pH 7.4, 100 mmol/liter NaCl, 0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 5 mmol/liter EDTA, 2 mmol/liter Na3VO4, protease inhibitor mixture including 104 mmol/liter benzenesulfonyl fluoride, 0.08 mmol/liter aprotinin, 2.1 mmol/liter leupeptin, 3.6 mmol/liter bestatin, 1.5 mmol/liter pepstatin A, and 1.4 mmol/liter leucylamido butane (Sigma). The protein concentration was determined by micro-Lowry. Aliquots was separated on SDS-PAGE and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham Biosciences). The membrane was blocked with T-PBS (1× PBS, 0.3% Tween 20) containing 5% dry milk and incubated with primary antibody (1:1,000) overnight at 4 °C. After three washes with T-PBS, the membrane was reblocked and incubated with secondary antibody for 1 h at room temperature. The primary antibodies used were anti-c-Sac, anti-v-Sac, anti-Akt, anti-phospho-Akt(Ser-473) antibody, anti-Bad, anti-phospho-Bad(Ser-136), anti-phospho-GSK-3β(Ser-9), anti-GSK-3β, anti-cleaved caspase-3 at 4 °C overnight. The secondary antibodies were anti-rabbit IgG/horseradish peroxidase conjugate or anti-mouse IgG/horseradish peroxidase conjugate (1:2,500 dilution, Promega). Bound antibodies were visualized by ECL chemiluminescence (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). For determination of Bad·Bcl-xL or Bad·14-3-3, cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-Bad antibody overnight at 4 °C followed by incubation with protein A-agarose Beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). Immunoprecipitates were then separated by SDS-PAGE and immuoblotted with antibodies to 14-3-3θ (Chemicon, Temecula, CA) or Bcl-xL (Cell Signaling).Statistical Analysis—Data were expressed as the mean ± S.E. and were compared between experimental groups with the use of one-way analysis of variance followed by Fisher's protected least significant difference. Probability values of p < 0.05 were considered statistically significant.RESULTSExpression of Human Tissue Kallikrein and Hemodynamics Parameters—Using a catheter-based strategy, we delivered Ad.CMV-TK locally into the rat left ventricle. Five days after kallikrein gene delivery, expression and localization of recombinant human tissue kallikrein were identified immunohistochemically in the left ventricle (Fig. 1). No specific staining was found in the left ventricle injected with or without control adenovirus, Ad.Null. Immunoreactive human tissue kallikrein levels (2.3 ± 0.2 ng/mg protein, n = 7) in cardiac extracts were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Human kallikrein was not detectable in rats injected with control virus. These results demonstrate that human tissue kallikrein was expressed in rat heart after local gene delivery. Table I shows that the hemodynamic parameters are comparable prior to and at 1 day and 5 days after gene delivery, indicating that local kallikrein gene transfer had no effect on the hemodynamic parameters during the experiment.Table IHemodynamic variables throughout the experimental periodBefore delivery (n = 3)Post gene delivery1 day (n = 4)p5 days (n = 4)pHR (bpm)239.7 ± 47.4228.5 ± 28.60.709244.3 ± 38.50.878MAP (mm Hg)93.5 ± 18.698.9 ± 13.10.65799.9 ± 14.80.595CO (ml/min)65.7 ± 8.559.3 ± 9.70.36962.3 ± 7.90.626+dP/dT (mm Hg/sec)2,345.7 ± 362.52,223.8 ± 238.10.6172,408.3 ± 325.60.796-dP/dT (mm Hg/sec)2,206.7 ± 365.82,045.3 ± 216.90.4762,263.8 ± 265.90.795 Open table in a new tab Kallikrein/Kinin Attenuates Cardiomyocyte Apoptosis after I/R—Apoptotic cardiomyocytes were detected by TUNEL staining in the myocardium of I/R. The ratio of TUNEL-positive cardiomyocytes to total number of cardiomyocytes in the Ad.CMV-TK group was significantly reduced compared with the Ad.Null group (28.4 ± 5.8% versus 41.3 ± 6.9%, n = 7 and 6, p < 0.01). However, the protective effect of kallikrein was blocked by icatibant (28.4 ± 5.8% versus 42.7 ± 6%, n = 7 and 6, p < 0.01) (Fig. 2A). The effect of kallikrein on apoptosis was confirmed further by DNA laddering (Fig. 2B). DNA fragmentation was not visualized in the myocardium of sham-operated rats, whereas I/R markedly increased DNA laddering in rat myocardium with or without Ad.Null delivery. Kallikrein gene transfer abrogated I/R-induced DNA fragmentation, whereas the effect of kallikrein was reversed by both icatibant and dominant-negative Akt (Ad.DN-Akt). These findings indicate that kallikrein/kinin protects against I/R-induced cardiomyocyte apoptosis via the kinin B2 receptor-Akt signaling pathway.Fig. 2Kallikrein gene transfer reduced cardiomyocyte apoptosis after acute I/R injury in rat hearts. A, representative photomicrographs show TUNEL-positive apoptotic cardiomyocytes from I/R-injured ventricular sections of rats injected with Ad.Null, Ad.CMV-TK, and Ad.CMV-TK plus icatibant infusion.

Kallikrein gene transfer resulted in increased phosphorylation of Src, Akt, GSK-3β, and Bad(Ser-136) in the I/R-injured myocardium compared with the control with or without injection of Ad.Null. However, kallikrein gene transfer had no effect on total Src, Akt, GSK-3β, and Bad levels. Furthermore, kallikrein did not lead to phosphorylation of Bad at Ser-112 or Ser-155 (data not shown). Cleaved caspase-3, which is a downstream proapoptotic signal, was reduced markedly after kallikrein gene delivery. The effects of kallikrein on these signaling effectors were blocked by icatibant and Ad.DN-A"

The recent discovery of receptor activity-modifying proteins (RAMPs) 1The abbreviations used are: RAMP, receptor activity-modifying protein; GPCR, G-protein-coupled receptor; CRLR, calcitonin receptor-like receptor; CGRP, calcitonin gene-related peptide; β2-AR, β2-adrenergic receptor; NSF, N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor; AMPA, α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazolepropionate; SNARE, soluble NSF attachment protein receptor; FBS, fetal bovine serum; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; BSA, bovine serum albumin; dPBS, Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline; d-siRNA, diced small interfering RNA; RMC, rat mesangial cell; GST, glutathione S-transferase; NEM, N-ethylmaleimide; AM (or ADM), adrenomedullin; AC, adenylate cyclase; GFP, green fluorescent protein; EGFP, enhanced GFP. has raised new possibilities for modes of regulation of G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). RAMPs were discovered as accessory proteins indispensable to the function of an orphan GPCR, now termed the calcitonin receptor-like receptor (CRLR) (1McLatchie L.M. Fraser N.J. Main M.J. Wise A.

RAMPs are required for the plasma membrane expression, as well as for determination of receptor phenotype for CRLR (selective ligand recognition) (1McLatchie L.M. Fraser N.J. Main M.J. Wise A.

Co-expression of RAMP1 with CRLR yields a calcitonin gene-related peptide-1 (CGRP-1) receptor, while coexpression of RAMP2 or RAMP3 with CRLR produces adrenomedullin receptors, AM-1 and AM-2 receptors, respectively (3Kamitani S.

Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 2883-2890Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). AM and CGRP are multifunctional peptides with many overlapping functions, ranging from potent vasodilation to proliferation regulation to regulation of salt and water balance (5Hinson J.P. Kapas S. Smith D.M. Endocr. Rev. 2000; 21: 138-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (695) Google Scholar). Differential expression of RAMP isoforms has been hypothesized to play a regulatory role in both physiological and pathophysiological disease states. Moreover, the recent identification of RAMP interactions with additional members of the Class II GPCR family and RAMP expression in cell lines lacking CRLR have raised the possibility of novel functions for RAMPs in GPCR regulation (6Christopoulos A. Christopoulos G. Morfis M. Udawela M. Laburthe M. Couvineau A. Kuwasako K. Tilakaratne N. Sexton P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3293-3297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). Upon activation, the CRLR-RAMP receptor complex causes cyclic AMP activation in most systems, irrespective of whether the ligand is AM or CGRP. In addition, the receptor complex undergoes desensitization and internalization (via clathrin-mediated endocytosis) in response to a prolonged agonist stimulation (7Hilairet S. Belanger C. Bertrand J. Laperriere A. Foord S.M. Bouvier M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42182-42190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Once internalized, the receptor complex either undergoes degradation or recycling, depending on the cell type. In HEK293 cells the CRLR-RAMP complex has been shown to be targeted to the lysosomes for degradation, while in rat mesangial cells, the CRLR-RAMP receptor complex is sorted for dephosphorylation and resensitization (and presumably recycling) as a fully functional receptor (2Kuwasako K. Shimekake Y. Masuda M. Nakahara K. Yoshida T. Kitaura M. Kitamura K. Eto T. Sakata T. J. Biol.

Pharmacol. 2000; 407: 205-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The mechanism that regulates the pathway to which the receptor complex is targeted after agonist-induced internalization remains unknown. Factors influencing the sorting of receptors in the early endosomes are largely unknown, but some of the critical players are beginning to be identified for the GPCRs. It has been shown in other GPCR systems that interactions with PSD-95/Discs-large/ZO-1 homology (PDZ) domain proteins are responsible for altering the receptor-targeting after internalization (9Xia Z.

Chem. 2001; 276: 45145-45152Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). The life cycle of the β2-adrenergic receptor (β2-AR) was reported to be altered in the presence of a protein termed N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor (NSF) (11Cong M. Perry S.J. Hu L.A. Hanson P.I. Claing A. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45145-45152Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). It has been shown that the β2-AR interacts with NSF via a PDZ type I motif (-DSLL) at its extreme C terminus. In addition, binding of NSF to the Glu2 subunits of the α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazolepropionate (AMPA) receptor was also demonstrated to be crucial for the recycling of the AMPA receptor (12Song I. Kamboj S. Xia J. Dong H. Liao D. Huganir R.L. Neuron. 1998; 21: 393-400Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar, 13Nishimune A. Isaac J.T. Molnar E. Noel J. Nash S.R. Tagaya M. Collingridge G.L. Nakanishi S. Henley J.M. Neuron. 1998; 21: 87-97Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar). NSF is a hexameric ATPase that plays a chaperoning role for soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptors (SNAREs) in the majority of membrane fusion events in a cell, but when targeting membrane receptors for recycling, NSF acts independently of the SNARE complex to promote rapid resensitization of the receptors at the plasma membrane (14Lin R.C. Scheller R.H. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 16: 19-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar, 15Neuwald A.F. Struct. Fold.

Similar to the C terminus of β2-AR, human RAMP3 C terminus has a type-I PDZ motif (-DTLL motif). CRLR, RAMP1, or RAMP2 do not, however, contain any PDZ motifs. We hypothesized that RAMP3, via its interaction with NSF, regulates the trafficking of the CRLR-RAMP3 complex. We show here that while CRLR-RAMP1 and CRLR-RAMP2 complexes do not interact with NSF, CRLR-RAMP3 complex interacts with NSF via the PDZ motif of RAMP3. Moreover, we demonstrate that overexpression of NSF in HEK293 cells alters the life cycle of CRLR-RAMP3 complex from a degradative to recycling pathway via interactions of the PDZ motif of RAMP3 and NSF. These findings demonstrate that RAMP3, in addition to determining the receptor phenotype and allowing receptor membrane expression, is also significantly involved with the regulation of the turnover of the CRLR-RAMP complex.

Cells were transfected with the DNA and Lipofectamine Plus as per manufacturer's protocol. Cells were collected for assays after 48 h of transfection. RAMP Cloning and Expression—Full-length cDNA of human RAMP1, -2, and -3 and bovine CRLR were described before (17Aiyar N. Disa J. Ao Z. Xu D. Surya A. Pillarisetti K. Parameswaran N. Gupta S.K.

Physiol. 2002; 282: C1322-C1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). CRLR, cloned into N1-EGFP and also in pcDNA3.1 expression vectors, was used for transfection in HEK293T cells. Desensitization and Resensitization Assays—48 h post-tranfection cells were pretreated with or without 10 nm ADM in DMEM containing 0.2% BSA for indicated time periods (up to 4 h). After agonist exposure, cells were washed three times with Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (dPBS, Invitrogen) containing 0.2% BSA and either frozen for membrane preparation for adenylate cyclase assays or used immediately for intact-cell radioligand binding. For receptor resensitization assays, after agonist exposure, cells were washed and incubated for indicated time periods in DMEM containing 0.2% BSA and 5 μg/ml cycloheximide to allow receptor recovery. Receptor Binding—Competition radioligand binding assays were performed as described by Aiyar et al. (19Aiyar N. Nambi P. Whitman M. Stassen F.L. Crooke S.T. Mol. Pharmacol. 1987; 31: 180-184PubMed Google Scholar) and as established in our laboratory. HEK293T cells were transfected and ∼200,000 cells/well seeded in poly-d-lysine precoated 24-well plates (BD Biosciences). 48 h post-tranfection cells were treated for desensitization or resensitization assays as described above. After agonist exposure, cells were washed three times with dPBS buffer containing 0.2% BSA then incubated with increasing concentrations (1 pm to 100 nm) of competing ligand and 175–250 pm125I-labeled rADM for 30 min at 37 °C. After incubation, plates were washed three times with ice-cold assay buffer and the reactions were terminated by the addition of 2 m NaOH. Cells were then harvested, and associated radioligand activity was counted on a γ-counter. All binding assays were performed in duplicate, with each experiment repeated at least three times. Nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of 100 nm of unlabeled rADM. Analysis of all binding data were performed by computer-assisted nonlinear least square fitting using GraphPad PRIZM (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). Adenylate Cyclase Assays—Cyclase activity was done as described before with slight modifications (18Nowak W. Parameswaran N. Hall C.S. Aiyar N. Sparks H.V. Spielman W.S. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 282: C1322-C1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Cells were harvested from P100 or P60 plates and homogenized in Tris-HCl (10 mm), EDTA (10 mm) buffer. Membranes were prepared by homogenization and centrifugation in Tris-HCl (50 mm), MgCl (10 mm) buffer. Final concentration of 20 μg of protein/assay tube was obtained. Membranes were incubated for 15 min at 30 °C with appropriate concentrations of drugs and assay mix containing ATP regeneration system and [α-32P]ATP. After the reaction was stopped (with stop solution containing [3H]cAMP) contents of the assay tubes were passed through Dowex and subsequently through alumina columns to separate the degradation products of ATP, by washing the Dowex with water and alumina with imidazole. Elution profile was done to determine the amount of water and imidazole needed to wash and elute the products. Product eluted from alumina column was counted for the presence of [3H]cAMP and [α-32P]cAMP in a β-counter. Each experiment was done in triplicate and repeated at least three times. Data are expressed as percent maximal response, % forskolin. cAMP Accumulation Assays—Rat mesangial cells were seeded on a 24-well plate until reaching 80–90% confluence, then incubated in serum-free medium overnight before experiment. Resensitization experiments were carried out as described under “Experimental Procedures,” with cells pretreated with 10 nm rAM and subsequently challenged with 100 nm rAM in the presence of 200 μm 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine. Determination of the cAMP level was measured using the Biotrak cAMP enzyme immunoassay system (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. cAMP levels in rat mesangial cells were calculated using a standard curve ranging from 10 to 104 fmol of cAMP. Each experiment was done in duplicate and repeated at least three times. Data are expressed as percent maximal response, % forskolin. RNA Interference Analysis—Gene-specific d-siRNA for lacZ (control) and RAMP3 were generated and purified using BLOCK-iT Dicer RNAi kit from Invitrogen. Rat mesangial cells (RMCs) were transfected with d-siRNAs using Lipofectamine 2000 as per manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). 48 h after transfection cells were frozen for mRNA analysis or used for cAMP accumulation assays or immunofluorescence microscopy. Quantitative PCR Analysis—Total RNA was isolated from RMCs using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). After sodium acetate-ethanol precipitation and several ethanol washes, RNA was used as a template in a quantitative PCR amplification procedure. Quantitative PCR analysis was carried out with the LUX (light upon extension) fluorogenic primer method following the protocol in the manufacturer's manual (Invitrogen), as described by Nazarenko et al. (20Nazarenko I. Pires R. Lowe B. Obaidy M. Rashtchian A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 2089-2195Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mutagenesis Procedure—Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using a PCR-based strategy that employs the pfu Turbo polymerase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). A pair of complementary oligonucleotides containing the appropriate point mutations in the sequence of RAMP or a premature stop codon at position 145 or 147 codon of RAMP-3 for deletion mutants were synthesized (Michigan State University Macromolecular Structure Facility). The PCR for the mutation was as follows: 94 °C for 2 min; 30 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 50 °C for 30 s, 68 °C for 8 min; final cycle of 68 °C for 8 min. PCR product was digested for 4 h with DpnI enzyme (Invitrogen) and transformed in to DH5α cells. Mutations were confirmed by automated sequencing (Michigan State University Genomic Technology Support Facility). Immunofluorescence Microscopy—HEK293 cells were transfected as described above and seeded at 24 h post-transfection onto collagen type I-coated coverslips. Resensitization assays were performed as described and reactions were stopped by fixing cells in 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min at room temperature. Samples were permeablized with 0.1% v/v Triton X-100 in PBS and blocked overnight in 0.1% v/v Triton X-100 in PBS + 10% goat serum. Samples were incubated in primary antibody in blocking buffer for 2 h at room temperature (NSF at 1:250 and RAMP3 at 1:200). Appropriate secondary antibodies were applied for 1 h at room temperature (goat anti-mouse Cy3 at 1:500 and goat anti-rabbit Cy5 at 1:400). Coverslips were mounted in Shandon Permafluor mounting medium and slides stored at 2–8 °C until analysis. Cells were visualized on a Zeiss 210 laser confocal microscope at a zoom of 2. Images presented are representative single optical sections of a z-series taken from at least 20 fields per experiment and at least three individual experiments. Fusion Protein Overlays and Western Blotting—10 μg of GST fusion proteins were resolved on a 10% SDS-PAGE gel and transferred to nitrocellulose filters. Filters were blocked with 5% w/v fat-free milk powder in Tris-buffered saline with Tween 20 (TTBS: 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 500 mm NaCl, 0.1% v/v Tween 20) and incubated overnight at 4 °C in lysates of HEK293 cells with or without overexpression NSF. Blots were then washed three times with TTBS buffer and incubated with anti-NSF monoclonal antibody for 2 h at room temperature. After three washes with TTBS, filters were incubated for 1 h with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse secondary antibody (Invitrogen), washed again with TTBS, soaked in SuperSignal West Pico chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce) and exposed to x-ray film. Same protocol, with the exception of the overnight incubation with cell lysate, was followed for immunoblot analysis of RAMP3. Statistics—Data are presented as mean ± S.E. Single group comparisons exercised a paired Student's t test method. Statistical significance was set at p < 0.05. Role of NSF in Resensitization of the CRLR-RAMP Complex—Our laboratory has previously published that RMCs endogenously express the AM1R (CRLR + RAMP2) and the AM2R (CRLR + RAMP3) (8Parameswaran N. Aiyar N. Wu H. Brooks D.P. Nambi P. Spielman W.S. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 2000; 407: 205-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). These data were repeated, and NSF expression was confirmed in the RMCs with reverse transcription-PCR and immunocytochemistry (data not shown). Our laboratory has also reported that pretreatment of RMCs with AM leads to an agonist-stimulated desensitization and internalization of the CRLR-RAMP complex. Phosphatase-dependent resensitization of AM responsiveness was also demonstrated after agonist-stimulated desensitization (8Parameswaran N. Aiyar N. Wu H. Brooks D.P. Nambi P. Spielman W.S. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 2000; 407: 205-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Measuring cAMP accumulation we repeated these results in this study (Fig. 1). As a preliminary test to determine whether NSF is involved in the resensitization of AM responsiveness, we used a pharmacological inhibitor of NSF, N-ethylmaleimide (NEM). In RMCs treated for 45 s with 50 μm NEM during the resensitization experiment, resensitization was blocked, as measured by cAMP accumulation (Fig. 1). NEM, however, did not affect basal cAMP accumulation or the desensitization response when compared with untreated cells, an important finding given the ability of NEM to interfere with Gα subunits (Fig. 1). These results indicate that NSF plays a role in the sorting of the CRLR-RAMP complex following agonist-induced internalization in this endogenous CRLR-RAMP system where the receptor complex is recycled. To fully evaluate the molecular mechanisms of this observation, we used HEK293 cells to examine the interaction of the CRLR-RAMP complex with NSF and the impact of this interaction on receptor trafficking. In contrast to RMCs, HEK293 cells express very low endogenous levels of RAMPs. Kuwasako et al. (2Kuwasako K. Shimekake Y. Masuda M. Nakahara K. Yoshida T. Kitaura M. Kitamura K. Eto T. Sakata T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29602-29609Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that in HEK293 cells overexpressing the CRLR-RAMP complex, agonist-induced internalization leads to receptor trafficking to a degradation pathway. In this study the internalized CRLR/RAMP complexes were colocalized with LAMP-1, a lysosomal marker, to show the targeting of the receptor for the degradation pathway. Utilizing adenylate cyclase activity assays, whole-cell ligand binding, and immunofluorescence microscopy we confirmed these findings (Fig. 2, A and B). Pretreatment of HEK293 cells transfected with CRLR and RAMP3 with 10 nm AM for 1 h resulted in desensitization of the adenylate cyclase response from 50% (of forskolin stimulation) in untreated cells to 28% in AM-treated cells (Fig. 2A left axis). Even after the removal of agonist and incubation with buffer alone for indicated times through 4 h, the adenylate cyclase response remained desensitized (Fig. 2A, left axis), indicating a lack of resensitization. Consistent findings were obtained with whole-cell binding and immunofluorescence microscopy experiments (Fig. 2, A, right axis, and B). To determine whether NSF overexpression could alter the receptor trafficking in this cell system, NSF was co-transfected with CRLR and RAMP3, and resensitization and recycling assays were performed. Resensitization and recycling were monitored by adenylate cyclase activity assays and whole-cell competition binding, respectively. In addition, visualization of the trafficking of the receptor complex was performed by immunofluorescence microscopy. In the absence of NSF, pretreatment with AM for 1 h resulted in desensitization of the adenylate cyclase response and internalization of the receptor complex. Upon removal of agonist and incubation with buffer alone for 4 h, the adenylate cyclase response remained desensitized and the receptor complex remained internalized, indicating a lack of resensitization (Fig. 3, A and B). In contrast, when NSF was co-transfected in the cells, although the desensitization response (i.e. response after 1-h agonist treatment) was not altered, the cells now underwent time-dependent resensitization (i.e. response after 1-, 2-, or 4-h agonist removal) in response to AM (Fig. 3B). Consistent findings were obtained with whole-cell binding and immunofluorescence microscopy experiments (Figs. 3A and 4). Time course experiments indicated the time course for complete resensitization and recycling of the CRLR-RAMP3 receptor complex to be 4 h in HEK293 cells, as measured by adenylate cyclase, whole-cell binding, and immunofluorescence microscopy experiments (Figs. 3 and 4). All subsequent experiments in HEK293 cells use the 4 h time point to determine receptor complex recycling and resensitization. These results indicate that the presence of NSF alters the intracellular sorting of the CRLR/RAMP3 receptor complex after AM-stimulated endocytosis.Fig. 4Localization of CRLR, RAMP3, and NSF in HEK293 cells during a recycling experiment.A, after 1-h ADM pretreatment, CRLR and RAMP3 are internalized and show co-localization with NSF intracellularly. After a 4 h recovery time post-ADM pretreatment, CRLR and RAMP3 show distribution at the plasma membrane of the cell, demonstrating recycling of the receptor complex. HEK293 cells transfected with CRLR-GFP, RAMP3, and NSF were pretreated with 10 nm ADM for 1 h. After pretreatment with ADM, cells were washed and incubated in serum-free medium with 5 μg/ml cycloheximide to allow receptor recycling for indicated times. Note: “1 hr Pretreatment” indicates time just after ADM pretreatment and wash steps, with no recovery time. Cells were fixed and components were visualized using anti-RAMP3 antibody (1:200) and anti-NSF antibody (1:250) with Cy5 anti-rabbit secondary antibody (1:400, in blue) and Cy3 anti-mouse secondary antibody (1:500, in red), respectively; CRLR-GFP is detected with an EGFP tag and shown in green; overlays of staining patterns are shown in the far right panels.

Interestingly, in contrast to RAMP3, presence of NSF did not alter the resensitization response or recycling pattern of the CRLR/RAMP1 or RAMP2 receptor complexes. Both the activity and receptor number remained at desensitized levels in cells transfected with CRLR+RAMP1 or CRLR+RAMP2 (along with NSF) (Fig. 5, A–D). Both CRLR/RAMP1 and CRLR/RAMP2 complexes showed no difference in receptor expression levels at the plasma membrane (as measured with whole-cell binding) in untreated cells, as compared with CRLR/RAMP3 complex. These results indicate that RAMP3 must contain a"

However, in its apoform, termed iron regulatory protein, it binds specific mRNAs, in some cases to block their translation and in other cases to enhance it (2Beinert H. Kennedy M.C. Stout C.D. Chem. Rev. 1996; 96: 2335-2374Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar, 3Kiley P.J. Beinert H. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2003; 6: 181-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). The apoforms of bacterial aconitases have recently also been found to bind specific mRNAs and function as translational regulators (4Tang Y. Guest J.R. Microbiology. 1999; 145: 3069-3079Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 5Alen C. Sonenshein A.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 10412-10417Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). In addition, three transcription factors that have regulatory Fe-S clusters have been characterized, namely, FNR, SoxR, and IscR (reviewed in Ref. 3Kiley P.J. Beinert H. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2003; 6: 181-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). All three of these transcription factors were discovered in E. coli, but it is now clear that Fe-S-dependent regulatory networks involving these proteins are present in many other bacterial genera. In this report we have presented evidence that WhiD, a member of a family of putative transcription factors previously characterized only at the genetic level, also binds a regulatory Fe-S cluster. The whiD developmental gene was isolated from Streptomyces coelicolor by map-based cloning and complementation (6Molle V. Palframan W.J. Findlay K.C. Buttner M.J. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 1286-1295Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Sequencing revealed that WhiD is a member of the Wbl (WhiB-like) family of putative transcription factors that are present throughout the actinomycetes but absent from all other organisms so far sequenced (6Molle V. Palframan W.J. Findlay K.C. Buttner M.J. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 1286-1295Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 7Soliveri J.A. Gomez J. Bishai W.R. Chater K.F. Microbiology. 2000; 146: 333-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The actinomycetes include Streptomyces, the genus responsible for the production of two-thirds of the known antibiotics, as well as medically important pathogens like Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Corynebacterium diphtheriae. Although the biochemical function of Wbl proteins, including WhiD, has not been demonstrated, circumstantial evidence suggests they are transcriptional activators: WhiB3, the WhiD orthologue of M. tuberculosis, was identified in a yeast two-hybrid screen in which the C-terminal domain (region 4.2) of the principal, essential RNA polymerase σ factor of M. tuberculosis was used as bait. This interaction was confirmed biochemically using surface-enhanced laser desorption and ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (8Steyn A.J. Collins D.M. Hondalus M.K. Jacobs W.R. Kawakami R.P. Bloom B.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 3147-3152Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). In addition, one gene in S. coelicolor (SCP1.161c, carried on the 356-kb plasmid SCP1 (9Bentley S.D. Brown S. Murphy L.D. Harris D.E. Quail M.A. Parkhill J. Barrell B.G. McCormick J.R. Santamaria R.I. Losick R. Yamasaki M. Kinashi H. Chen C.W. Chandra G. Jakimowicz D. Kieser H.M. Kieser T. Chater K.F. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 51: 1615-1628Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar)) encodes a protein having a Wbl at its N terminus and an RNA polymerase σ factor at its C terminus. Consistent with the proposed role of Wbl proteins as transcription factors, mutations in different wbl genes have been found to cause a wide range of highly pleiotropic phenotypes in both Streptomyces and Mycobacterium, demonstrating that Wbl proteins play important roles in actinomycete biology. The first member of the wbl family to be characterized was the whiB developmental gene itself. S. coelicolor whiB mutants produce abnormally long, tightly coiled aerial hyphae that are completely blocked in their ability to form sporulation septa (10Chater K.F. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1972; 72: 9-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 11Davis N.K. Chater K.F. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1992; 232: 351-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 12Fla ̈rdh K. Findlay K.C. Chater K.F. Microbiology. 1999; 145: 2229-2243Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). In contrast, whiD mutants can make sporulation septa but form spores that differ from those of the wild-type in being heat sensitive, prone to lysis, highly irregular in size, and extremely variable in spore cell wall deposition (6Molle V. Palframan W.J. Findlay K.C. Buttner M.J. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 1286-1295Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 13McVittie A. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1974; 81: 291-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In addition, whiD spores are frequently partitioned into irregular smaller units through the deposition of additional septa, often laid down in several different planes, very close to the spore poles (6Molle V. Palframan W.J. Findlay K.C. Buttner M.J. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 1286-1295Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 13McVittie A. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1974; 81: 291-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The orthologue of S. coelicolor whiB in Mycobacterium smegmatis, whmD, is essential, but controlled depletion experiments showed that WhmD is required for proper septation and cell division (14Gomez J.E. Bishai W.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 8554-8559Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Emphasizing the important and diverse roles of Wbl proteins, the wblC locus of S. coelicolor was identified genetically in a screen for mutants pleiotropically sensitive to a wide range of chemically and functionally unrelated, clinically important antibiotics. WblC has now been shown to control innate multidrug resistance, not only in S. coelicolor but also in the major human pathogen, M. tuberculosis (15.Morris, R. P., Nguyen, L. D., Nguyen, K. T., Gatfield, J., Schoolnik, G. K., Pieters, J., and Thompson, C. J. (2003) Abstracts of the 13th International Symposium on the Biology of the Actinomycetes, Melbourne, Australia, December 1 –5, 2003, p. 26, University of the Sunshine Coast, Queensland, AustraliaGoogle Scholar). Overexpression of wblC leads to enhanced multidrug resistance (15.Morris, R. P., Nguyen, L. D., Nguyen, K. T., Gatfield, J., Schoolnik, G. K., Pieters, J., and Thompson, C. J. (2003) Abstracts of the 13th International Symposium on the Biology of the Actinomycetes, Melbourne, Australia, December 1 –5, 2003, p. 26, University of the Sunshine Coast, Queensland, AustraliaGoogle Scholar). The remarkable antibiotic tolerance of M. tuberculosis is the main cause of treatment failure, relapse, and acquired drug resistance in patients with tuberculosis, making WblC an attractive target for therapeutic intervention (15.Morris, R. P., Nguyen, L. D., Nguyen, K. T., Gatfield, J., Schoolnik, G. K., Pieters, J., and Thompson, C. J. (2003) Abstracts of the 13th International Symposium on the Biology of the Actinomycetes, Melbourne, Australia, December 1 –5, 2003, p. 26, University of the Sunshine Coast, Queensland, AustraliaGoogle Scholar). Thus, the Wbl family of proteins is novel and of academic and medical significance. To date, genome sequencing and directed approaches have identified >80 wbl genes in the actinomycete genera Streptomyces, Mycobacterium, Streptoverticillium, and Rhodococcus (e.g.Fig. 1). In addition to whiB and whiD, this includes 11 further wbl genes in S. coelicolor itself, 8 on the chromosome and 3 on the giant linear plasmid, SCP1 (9Bentley S.D. Brown S. Murphy L.D. Harris D.E. Quail M.A. Parkhill J. Barrell B.G. McCormick J.R. Santamaria R.I. Losick R. Yamasaki M. Kinashi H. Chen C.W. Chandra G. Jakimowicz D. Kieser H.M. Kieser T. Chater K.F. Mol.

Nature. 2002; 417: 141-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (2602) Google Scholar). With the exception of the Wbl σ factor fusion protein (SCP1.161c), all the Wbl proteins are small, varying in length from 81 to 122 residues. A striking feature of the Wbl family is four cysteine residues (Cys-23, -53, -56, and -62 in WhiD) that are perfectly conserved in all members, with the exception of only four proteins in which Cys-23 is replaced by aspartate (Fig. 1). This suggests that these residues might act as ligands for a metal cofactor. Here we have presented evidence that WhiD can bind a [4Fe-4S] cluster that reacts with oxygen to generate a [2Fe-2S] cluster. Overexpression of WhiD—A 0.43-kb fragment carrying an NdeI site overlapping the ATG start codon of whiD, an EcoRI site at the 5′-end, and a HindIII site at the 3′-end was generated by PCR using pIJ6626 (6Molle V. Palframan W.J. Findlay K.C. Buttner M.J. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 1286-1295Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) as template. The PCR program was 5 min at 95 °C, followed by 25 cycles of 1 min at 95 °C, 30 s at 68 °C, and 30 s at 72 °C before a final 10-min incubation at 72 °C. The primers were 5′-GCTACAAGGGAATTCCATATGGCAGATTTCTCCCG-3′ introducing the NdeI and EcoRI sites and 5′-GACGCGCTGACCGCGTCGGGAAGCTTGCGGGGCC-3′ introducing the HindIII site. The PCR product was digested with EcoRI and HindIII and cloned into EcoRI-HindIII-cut pIJ2925 (17Janssen G.R. Bibb M.J. Gene. 1993; 124: 133-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar) to create pIJ6630. The resulting allele of whiD was sequenced over its entire length to ensure that only the desired change had been introduced. Finally, the whiD overexpression allele was excised as a 0.43-kb NdeI-BglII fragment and cloned into the expression vector pET11c (Novagen) cut with NdeI and BamHI, generating pIJ6990. PCR Mutagenesis and Complementation—To incorporate single point mutations into whiD, two complementary primers, both containing the mutation, were used in an amplification reaction with plasmid DNA as the template. Reaction conditions were 94 °C for 5 min and then 25 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 62 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 10 min, followed by 72 °C for 15 min. The reaction mixtures were transferred to 1.5-ml tubes and treated with 10 units of DpnI for 30 min at 37 °C to destroy the methylated template DNA and then 72 °C for 30 min to inactivate DpnI. After cooling on ice, each reaction mixture was treated with 2 units of T4 DNA ligase for 1 h at room temperature and used to transform competent E. coli DH5α. After sequencing on both strands to confirm that only the intended cysteine to alanine codon changes had been introduced, mutant alleles were isolated as 1.3-kb BamHI-SphI fragments and cloned into pSET152 (18Bierman M. Logan R. O'Brien K. Seno E.T. Rao R.N. Schoner B.E. Gene. 1992; 116: 43-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (1213) Google Scholar) to create a series of constructs otherwise identical to pIJ6627 (carrying the wild-type whiD allele) (6Molle V. Palframan W.J. Findlay K.C. Buttner M.J. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 1286-1295Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Plasmids were transferred from E. coli to the whiD null mutant strain J2152 (6Molle V. Palframan W.J. Findlay K.C. Buttner M.J. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 1286-1295Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) by conjugation, as described (19Kieser T. Bibb M.J. Buttner M.J. Chater K.F. Hopwood D.A. Practical Streptomyces Genetics. The John Innes Foundation, Norwich, United Kingdom2000: 249-250Google Scholar). Cell Growth—Aerobic E. coli cultures were routinely grown in Luria Bertani medium, supplemented with 50 μm iron, zinc, and copper ions, at 37 °C in 2-liter flasks with shaking at 230 rpm. Carbenicillin (100 μg ml-1) was required for maintenance of pIJ6990. Exponentially growing cells of E. coli BL21-CodonPlus-RIL (Stratagene) bearing pIJ6990 were induced with 0.5 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 5 h at 37 °C, harvested by centrifugation, washed with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, and frozen. Protein expression was checked by SDS-PAGE of whole-cell lysates. Purification of WhiD—After thawing, the cell paste derived from growth of BL21-CodonPlus-RIL pIJ6990 was resuspended in 40 ml of buffer C (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl) containing an EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). Cells were disrupted in a French press, and the lysate was clarified by centrifugation. WhiD is found in the insoluble fraction as inclusion bodies. Therefore, the pellet fraction was washed with 30 ml of buffer D (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20), harvested by centrifugation, and solubilized by slow agitation in 8 m urea at room temperature using buffer E (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm sodium phosphate, 10 mm dithiothreitol (DTT), 1The abbreviations used are: DTT, dithiothreitol; EPR, electron paramagnetic resonance. 8 m urea). The solution was clarified by centrifugation, and the supernatant was dialyzed at 4 °C overnight against buffer F (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm DTT, 5% glycerol). The dialyzed material was clarified by centrifugation and concentrated using a Centri-prep concentrator (10-kDa cutoff; Millipore). The purity of the protein was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and the concentration determined (Bio-Rad protein assay). Reconstitution of an Iron-Sulfur Cluster—All steps of the reconstitution procedure were performed anaerobically inside a glovebox (Belle Technology) in an N2 atmosphere containing less than 2 ppm O2. Buffer F, Buffer G (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl), and H2O were purged with N2 and kept anaerobic for more than 24 h before use. Fe(NH4)2(SO4)2, FeCl3, l-Cys, and DTT were transferred into the glovebox as weighed aliquots and dissolved in H2O inside the glovebox to create 10× stock solutions. In Reconstitution Method I, WhiD was anaerobically equilibrated in Buffer G and treated with DTT (10 mm final concentration), followed by Fe(NH4)2(SO4)2 or FeCl3 in 5-fold molar excess over WhiD, and finally with l-cysteine (2 mm final concentration) and 2.5 μg of NifS (a kind gift from Dr. Sara Austin). The reaction mixture was incubated at room temperature overnight. In Reconstitution Method II, anaerobically equilibrated WhiD was incubated with a 1.5-fold molar excess of Na2S and the same excess of either Fe(NH4)2(SO4)2 or FeCl3 in 2 ml of buffer F at 22 °C for 4 h. The reconstituted WhiD protein was separated from low molecular mass material using a PD-10 desalting column (equilibrated and eluted with buffer G for Method I or buffer F for Method II), inside the glovebox and concentrated to ∼11 mg ml-1 using a Centri-prep concentrator (10-kDa cutoff; Millipore). Protein concentration was determined using the BioRad protein assay. EPR Spectroscopy—Perpendicular mode X-band electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectra were recorded on an EPR spectrometer comprising an ER-200D electromagnet and microwave bridge interfaced to an EMX control system (Bruker Spectrospin) and fitted with a liquid helium flow-cryostat (ESR-9; Oxford Instruments) and a dual-mode X-band cavity (Bruker type ER4116DM). Other Analytical Techniques—UV-visible absorption spectra were collected using a Lambda 35 UV/VIS spectrometer (PerkinElmer) in the 230–700 nm wavelength range. Measurements were carried out at room temperature in a quartz cuvette with a path length of 10 mm. Fluorescence of WhiD samples was recorded at room temperature using an LS55 luminescence spectrometer (PerkinElmer) with an excitation wavelength of 280 nm and an emission range of 300–450 nm with a scan rate of 500 nm min-1. The circular dichroism spectra were measured with a JASCO model J-810. The iron content of WhiD was determined using inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (Southern Analytical, Brighton, UK). The iron content of WhiD was also estimated using the molar extinction coefficient of 4000 m-1 cm-1/mole of iron at 400 nm for an Fe-S cluster (20Sweeney W.V. Rabinowitz J.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1980; 49: 139-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Sulfide content was determined as described (21Brumby P.E. Miller R.W. Massey V. J. Biol. Chem. 1965; 240: 2222-2228Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). WhiD, without any affinity tags, was expressed in E. coli grown in medium supplemented with 50 μm iron, zinc, and copper ions. WhiD was present in highly colored inclusion bodies from which it could be purified by solubilization in 8 m urea followed by dialysis to induce protein refolding. WhiD prepared in this way retained its red-brown color. The absorption spectrum showed a band at 420 nm and two shoulders at 450 and 550 nm, strongly suggestive of a [2Fe-2S] cluster (Fig. 2) (22Stephens P.J. Thomson A.J. Dunn J.B.R. Keiderling T.A. Rawlings J. Rao K.K. Hall D.O. Biochem. J. 1978; 27: 4770-4778Crossref Scopus (100) Google Scholar). It is noteworthy that this cluster appears to have, at least partially, survived exposure to 8 m urea. This form of WhiD was >98% pure as judged by SDS-PAGE and contained iron (but not nickel, zinc, copper, or cobalt) according to metal analysis (inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy). The iron:WhiD ratio varied between 0.3 and 0.75, depending on the preparation, showing that the cluster was substoichiometric (15–37% occupancy for a [2Fe-2S] cluster). This may have arisen because all purification steps were carried out aerobically. Therefore, WhiD, purified in this way, was subjected to attempts at Fe-S cluster reconstitution under anaerobic conditions. Two methods were used. Reactions were carried out either using Na2S alone or by generating sulfide ion enzymatically using l-cysteine and NifS (l-cysteine desulfurase). Reactions were carried out at room temperature, and progress was monitored by UV-visible spectroscopy in an anaerobically sealed cuvette. In both cases, Fe-S cluster reconstitution was complete in 3–6 h, and both methods led to identical absorption spectra (data not shown). The resulting samples were purified by anaerobic gel filtration and found to contain 3.67–4.2 iron atoms/WhiD monomer and similar amounts of sulfide ion. The visible spectrum of reconstituted WhiD gave a molar absorption coefficient (ϵ) at 400 nm of ∼4000 m-1 cm-1/mol of iron, a value characteristic of an Fe-S cluster. The absorption spectrum of the reconstituted protein has a single broad peak at 420 nm and no other resolved features at longer wavelength. It is different from that of the cluster in the protein purified aerobically from inclusion bodies. The absorption spectrum, together with the absence of an EPR signal in the g ∼2 region (see below), is characteristic of a [4Fe-4S] cluster (22Stephens P.J. Thomson A.J. Dunn J.B.R. Keiderling T.A. Rawlings J. Rao K.K. Hall D.O. Biochem. J. 1978; 27: 4770-4778Crossref Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Oligomeric State of WhiD—To determine the possible effect of Fe-S cluster reconstitution on the oligomeric state of WhiD, samples of the protein were examined by analytical gel filtration under anaerobic conditions. Reconstituted WhiD gave a homogenous monomeric peak, whereas the partially iron-loaded material solubilized from inclusion bodies was markedly heterogeneous with no monomeric peak (Fig. 3). Further, the far UV CD spectrum gave evidence that reconstituted WhiD was structured. Consistent with these observations, the maximum concentration achievable in buffered solution for the reconstituted protein (∼50 mg ml-1) was much higher than for the partially iron-loaded material solubilized from inclusion bodies. Oxygen-induced Changes in the Fe-S Cluster—Upon exposure to air, the absorption spectrum of anaerobically reconstituted WhiD changes. A sample of protein carried in a sealed anaerobic cuvette was exposed to oxygen by opening the cuvette. The sample was mixed with air by pipetting, the cuvette was resealed, and subsequent changes in the absorption spectrum were measured versus time (Fig. 4A). A plot of absorbance changes at 505 nm versus time (Fig. 4B) shows two phases, an increase over the first 50 min followed by a steady decrease over the next 100 min until the protein solution is colorless in the near UV/visible region. The absorption spectrum after ∼50 min was very similar to that of the [2Fe-2S] cluster present in the material solubilized from inclusion bodies. These changes are consistent with an oxygen-induced change from a [4Fe-4S] to a [2Fe-2S] cluster followed by the complete loss of cluster from the protein. The rate of each phase was dependent on a number of factors, including the degree of exposure to oxygen and the presence of DTT. If no DTT were present, the phase corresponding to the [4Fe-4S] to [2Fe-2S] conversion was much faster, becoming difficult to observe by absorption spectroscopy. These changes could also be followed by observation of the fluorescence spectrum of the tryptophan residues. WhiD contains three tryptophans (Trp-15, -17, and -76), at least two of which must be close to cysteine residues Cys-23 and -62 that likely bind the cluster. As the oxygen reaction proceeded, the protein tryptophan fluorescence intensity first dropped on the time scale corresponding to the conversion of the [4Fe-4S] cluster to the [2Fe-2S] form and then increased as all cluster was lost from the protein (data not shown). Fe(III)-S charge transfer absorption bands overlap the emission maximum for tryptophan fluorescence. As a consequence, Fe-S clusters absorb strongly in the 360-nm region. The [4Fe-4S] and [2Fe-2S] clusters clearly quench the tryptophan fluorescence to different degrees, resulting in an initial decrease and subsequent increase in fluorescence intensity. On complete loss of the cluster, the fluorescence intensity was at a maximum. EPR Spectroscopy of WhiD—Reconstituted WhiD, which had been purified anaerobically by gel filtration, was analyzed by EPR spectroscopy, both as prepared and after reduction with sodium dithionite (Fig. 5). Reduction caused the red-brown color of the sample to bleach partially, showing a loss of the broad shoulder between 400–420 nm in the absorption spectrum (Fig. 5A). This is characteristic of the reduction of [4Fe-4S]2+ to [4Fe-4S]1+. Almost no EPR signal was apparent in the spectrum at liquid helium temperatures of the sample as prepared, but intense EPR signals were seen at g = 2.06, 1.94 after reduction with dithionite (Fig. 5B). These observations are consistent with a one-electron reduction of a [4Fe-4S]2+ cluster, that is EPR silent (electron spin S = 0), to a [4Fe-4S]1+ state with electron spin S = ½. The temperature dependence and the microwave power saturation properties of these signals were also consistent with a [4Fe-4S]1+ center rather than a [2Fe-2S]1+ cluster (23Orme-Johnson W.H. Sands R.H. Lovenberg W. Iron-Sulfur Proteins. 2. Academic Press, New York1973: 194-217Google Scholar). Four Invariant Cysteines Are Essential for WhiD Function in Vivo—To assess the importance of Cys-23, -53, -56, and -62 for WhiD function in vivo, each cysteine was individually mutated to alanine and the four resulting whiD mutant alleles and the wild-type allele were used to generate five otherwise identical constructs, based on the integrative vector pSET152 (21Brumby P.E. Miller R.W. Massey V. J. Biol. Chem. 1965; 240: 2222-2228Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Each was introduced into the constructed whiD null mutant J2152 (9Bentley S.D. Brown S. Murphy L.D. Harris D.E. Quail M.A. Parkhill J. Barrell B.G. McCormick J.R. Santamaria R.I. Losick R. Yamasaki M. Kinashi H. Chen C.W. Chandra G. Jakimowicz D. Kieser H.M. Kieser T. Chater K.F. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 51: 1615-1628Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), and its ability to complement the mutant phenotype was assessed (Fig. 6, and data not shown). As expected, J2152 was fully complemented by the wild-type whiD allele. In contrast, introduction of any of the C23A, C53A, C56A, and C62A mutant alleles had no influence on the whiD null mutant phenotype, showing that each of the four cysteines was essential for WhiD function in vivo (Fig. 6, and data not shown). This work has shown that the WhiD protein of S. coelicolor can bind either [4Fe-4S] or [2Fe-2S] iron-sulfur cluster cores. Expression in E. coli produces a protein that is not properly folded, contains substoichiometric amounts of iron, and has an absorption spectrum characteristic of a [2Fe-2S] cluster. However, cluster reconstitution causes a [4Fe-4S] core cluster to become bound and yields a monomeric form of the protein that runs as a single, narrow peak on anaerobic analytical gel filtration. Hence, cluster insertion causes the protein to fold into a single conformer. Evidence for the [4Fe-4S] core is provided by a characteristic absorption spectrum together with the ability to undergo reduction to a paramagnetic state, S = ½, giving rise to an EPR signal typical of such a cluster core. Reaction of the [4Fe-4S]2+ form of the protein with air leads to transformation first to a [2Fe-2S]2+ core followed by complete cluster loss. Cluster transformation with air-saturated buffer ([O2] ∼230 μm at 25 °C) (24.Crack, J. C. (2003) Mechanistic Studies on the Fumerate and Nitrate Reduction Transcriptional Regulator (FNR). Ph.D. thesis, University of East Anglia, Norwich, United KingdomGoogle Scholar) has a half-life of about 25 min in the presence of 1 mm DTT, which may be slow for a regulating process. However, in the absence of DTT the transformation becomes much more rapid, being difficult to detect with conventional spectrophotometry. Stopped-flow kinetic methods will be required to follow the process under these conditions. Cysteine residues Cys-23, -53, -56, and C62, each of which is essential for protein function in vivo, are candidate cluster ligands. These four residues are perfectly conserved in all ∼80 members of the Wbl family, with the exception of just four Wbl proteins in which Cys-23 is replaced by an aspartate (Fig. 1). However, there are examples of [4Fe-4S] clusters coordinated by three thiolate side chains of cysteines and one carboxylate of aspartate (25George S.J. Armstrong F.A. Hatchikian E.C. Thomson A.J. Biochem. J. 1989; 264: 275-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). It is therefore tempting to speculate that all members of the Wbl family can bind a [4Fe-4S] cluster. In the transcription factors SoxR, FNR, and IscR, the Fe-S cluster plays a key regulatory role. SoxR senses superoxide stress, stimulating transcription of the gene encoding SoxS, which in turn activates >50 genes encoding enzymes that detoxify superoxide (e.g. superoxide dismutase) and repair oxidative damage in the cell. In the absence of oxidative stress, SoxR is a homodimer with one [2Fe-2S]1+ cluster/monomer; this form of the protein binds the soxS promoter but does not activate transcription. In the presence of superoxide, the cluster is oxidized to its [2Fe-2S]2+ state in which it is competent to stimulate transcription of soxS (3Kiley P.J. Beinert H. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2003; 6: 181-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). FNR, a homodimer containing one [4Fe-4S]2+ cluster/monomer, regulates >100 genes in response to oxygen limitation, repressing genes involved in aerobic respiration and activating genes concerned with the use of alternative terminal electron acceptors. These functions of dimerization, site-specific DNA binding, and transcriptional activation require an intact [4Fe-4S]2+ cluster, and exposure of whole cells or the purified protein to oxygen causes its rapid conversion to a [2Fe-2S]2+ center and resultant inactivation of the protein (3Kiley P.J. Beinert H. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2003; 6: 181-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar, 26Crack J.C. Green J. Thomson A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 9278-9286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). IscR represses expression of the isc operon that specifies the Fe-S cluster assembly pathway in E. coli, and EPR spectroscopy shows that IscR contains a [2Fe-2S] cluster. Current evidence suggests a homeostatic feedback model in which the repressor activity of IscR is lost under Fe-S cluster-limiting conditions (3Kiley P.J. Beinert H. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2003; 6: 181-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). How might a [4Fe-4S] cluster contribute to the biological function of WhiD and, by implication, the function of other members of the Wbl family? One possibility would be that the cluster plays a purely structural role. For example, the [4Fe-4S] cluster of E. coli endonuclease III appears to play a key role in stabilizing a cluster-bound loop that interacts with the DNA backbone (27Fu W. O'Handley S. Cunningham R.P. Johnson M.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16135-16137Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Fromme J.C. Verdine G.L. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 3461-3471Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). However, whereas the [4Fe-4S] cluster of endonuclease III is redox inert, the [4Fe-4S] cluster of WhiD can undergo single electron oxidation/reduction and is oxygen-labile, suggesting that the activity of WhiD and, by implication, those of other members of the Wbl family, might be redox regulated in vivo. Streptomyces species have traditionally been regarded as obligate aerobes, but one of the most interesting and unexpected outcomes of the S. coelicolor genome sequence was the discovery of a number of genes and operons encoding enzymes that, in facultative anaerobes such as E. coli and B. subtilis, are typically involved in microaerobic and anaerobic metabolism. These enzymes include respiratory nitrate and nitrite reductases, formate dehydrogenase, NarK, and cytochrome d oxidase (16Bentley S.D. Chater K.F. Cerden ̃o-Ta ́rraga A.M. Challis G.L. Thomson N.R.

Microbiol. 1998; 52: 165-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Further, several transcriptional regulators controlled by redox switches have been identified in Streptomyces and characterized to varying degrees, including σR-RsrA (reviewed in Ref. 30Paget M.S.B. Buttner M.J. Annu. Rev. Genet. 2003; 37: 91-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar), Rex (31Brekasis D. Paget M.S.B.

Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 3767-3774Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The oxygen-induced 4Fe to 2Fe switch in WhiD is reminiscent of the regulation of FNR by oxygen in facultative anaerobes such as E. coli. However, WhiD and WhiB are positive regulators of sporulation. They are believed to function in the aerial mycelium, which is presumably an oxygen-sufficient cell type, making the suggestion that they function principally as oxygen sensors unlikely (unless the aerial mycelium is in fact oxygen deficient because of the hydrophobic coating that protects it from desiccation (35Elliot M.A. Talbot N.J. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2004; 7: 594-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar)). Instead, we suggest that WhiD and WhiB proteins might respond to redox changes that occur as an inescapable part of alterations in cellular metabolism accompanying the developmental process, for example during the downshift from a metabolism associated with rapid aerial growth to that of non-growing hyphae about to undergo consecutive stages of sporulation. Although the underlying mechanism is not understood, there is at least one published observation connecting redox biology and differentiation in S. coelicolor: constitutive overexpression of the disulfide stress regulon, caused by loss of the σR-specific anti-σ factor RsrA, blocks the initiation of sporulation (36Paget M.S.B.

Our current understanding of the biochemical roles of WhiB-like proteins is limited: challenges for the future will be to identify genes that are down-regulated in whiD mutants, to determine whether WhiD affects expression of these genes by direct DNA binding or though some other mechanism, and to investigate how the state of the WhiD Fe-S cluster affects these functions. We thank Virginie Molle for making the WhiD overexpression construct, Shirley Fairhurst for help with preliminary EPR experiments, Sara Austin for the gift of NifS, Patricia Kiley, Monica Chander, Matt Hutchings, and Marie Elliot for helpful advice, and Gary Sawers and Mark Paget for comments on the manuscript."
https://openalex.org/W1986117681,"Binding sites for the dimeric transcription factor activator protein (AP)-1 are found in numerous immunoregulatory and inflammatory genes. The precise mechanisms by which AP-1 activates or represses immune response genes and in particular the roles of individual AP-1 subunits in inflammatory responses are largely unknown. We report here that c-Fos and Fos-related antigen-1 (Fra-1), two inducible components of AP-1, are recruited to the endogenous interleukin (IL)-8 promoter in an IL-1-dependent manner. c-Fos activates IL-8 transcription and synergizes in this effect with p65 NF-κB. In contrast, Fra-1 strongly inhibits inducible IL-8 transcription. Fra-1 activation involves its stabilization, ubiquitination, and interaction with histone deacetylase-1. Blockade of MEK1 by PD98059 suppresses c-Fos and Fra-1 expression and, thus, affects two counteractive signals for IL-8 mRNA synthesis simultaneously. This disturbs the inducible recruitment of TATA box-binding protein and RNA polymerase II to the IL-8 promoter. Additional experiments reveal that, in conjunction with p65 NF-κB, the MEK1-ERK-dependent synthesis of c-Fos and Fra-1 serves to adjust the overall expression level of IL-8 in response to two of its physiological inducers, IL-1 and epidermal growth factor. Relative to c-Fos, the delayed recruitment of Fra-1 to the IL-8 promoter provides an example how AP-1 subunits may dampen excessive chemokine synthesis.

Karin M. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 2390-2400Crossref PubMed Scopus (1387) Google Scholar, 2Shaulian E. Karin M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 131-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (2214) Google Scholar). AP-1 converts extracellular signals into changes of the expression of target genes, and AP-1 binding sites are found in a large number of genes. AP-1 is not a single protein but a homo- or heterodimer composed of members of the Jun, Fos, and ATF protein families (2Shaulian E. Karin M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 131-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (2214) Google Scholar). Jun (c-Jun, JunB, and JunD) and Fos (c-Fos, FosB, Fos-related antigen (Fra-1, Fra-2)) proteins act as dimeric transcription factors that can bind to the promoter regions of numerous mammalian genes. Fos and Jun proteins can also dimerize to many other basic leucine zipper proteins such as ATF, C/EBP, Maf, and NF-E2, increasing the number of the potential AP-1 factors that bind to a given AP-1 site (3Chinenov Y. Kerppola T.K. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 2438-2452Crossref PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar). Furthermore, activity of AP-1 proteins is controlled at multiple levels, first by changes in gene transcription, mRNA turnover, and protein stability (4Karin M. Liu Z. Zandi E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 240-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (2306) Google Scholar), second by interaction with non-basic leucine zipper transcription factors (3Chinenov Y. Kerppola T.K. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 2438-2452Crossref PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar, 5Stein B. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Ballard D.W. Greene W.C. Angel P. Herrlich P. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3879-3891Crossref PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar), and third by phosphorylation of their transactivation domains by mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases (4Karin M. Liu Z. Zandi E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 240-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (2306) Google Scholar). The number of AP-1 proteins and their complex control make it difficult to assess the impact of particular individuals on gene expression. Recently, the usage of genetically altered mice and cells derived from them has unraveled crucial functions for AP-1 as a regulator of cell life and death (6Jochum W. Passegue E. Wagner E.F. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 2401-2412Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar). However, very little information is available from these model systems on the role of AP-1 in inflammation and infection despite the fact that AP-1 binding sites are found in many genes activated during innate (and also adaptive) immune reactions (7Kracht M. Saklatvala J. Cytokine. 2002; 20: 91-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Because of the structural and regulatory complexity of AP-1, at present a prerequisite for defining its role in inflammation is to determine the composition of AP-1 complexes as a function of time and stimulus for individual genes, in particular those that are crucial for the inflammatory process (7Kracht M. Saklatvala J. Cytokine. 2002; 20: 91-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). In this regard, a family of secreted proteins called chemokines is exceptionally important, because these factors control the process of leukocyte invasion into injured tissue, a hallmark of inflammation (8Baggiolini M. J. Intern. Med. 2001; 250: 91-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (609) Google Scholar). Interleukin (IL)-8, a prototypic human chemokine, was detected more than a decade ago as the founding member of the chemokine superfamily (9Baggiolini M. Clark-Lewis I. FEBS Lett. 1992; 307: 97-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (734) Google Scholar). IL-8 secretion and mRNA synthesis are strongly regulated by more than 100-fold by a plethora of external stimuli (10Hoffmann E. Dittrich-Breiholz O. Holtmann H. Kracht M. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2002; 72: 847-855Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A major part of this regulation occurs at the transcriptional level. A relatively small region of the 5′-flanking region of the IL-8 gene (nucleotides -1 to -133) is essential and sufficient for its transcriptional induction by most stimuli (10Hoffmann E. Dittrich-Breiholz O. Holtmann H. Kracht M. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2002; 72: 847-855Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This promoter element contains an NF-κB element that is required for activation in all cell types studied as well as a single consensus AP-1 site whose sequence is tgactca (3Chinenov Y. Kerppola T.K. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 2438-2452Crossref PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar, 10Hoffmann E. Dittrich-Breiholz O. Holtmann H. Kracht M. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2002; 72: 847-855Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Unlike the binding site for NF-κB, the AP-1 site as well as additional sites contained within the IL-8 core promoter, namely those for C/EBP, OCT-1 (11Stein B. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7191-7198Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Wu G.D. Lai E.J. Huang N. Wen X. J. Biol.

Dittrich-Breiholz O. Holtmann H. Kracht M. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2002; 72: 847-855Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We and others have provided numerous lines of functional evidence that coordinated activation of the MAP kinases ERK, c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase, and p38 is important for IL-8 regulation in response to proinflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin (IL)-1 (14Krause A.

Leukocyte Biol. 2002; 72: 847-855Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the precise molecular mechanisms by which all three types of MAP kinases regulate onset, duration, or extent of IL-8 mRNA synthesis have been largely elusive. The fact that MAP kinases regulate AP-1 activity suggests that they may induce IL-8 transcription via the single AP-1 site. However, MAP kinase also regulates other steps in the overall process of gene expression such as chromatin remodeling (19Saccani S. Pantano S. Natoli G. Nat. Immunol. 2002; 3: 69-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar) or, as found by us (20Holtmann H. Enninga J. Kalble S. Thiefes A. Dorrie A. Broemer M. Winzen R. Wilhelm A. Ninomiya-Tsuji J.

Muller M. Gaestel M. Resch K. Holtmann H. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4969-4980Crossref PubMed Scopus (711) Google Scholar), IL-8 mRNA stability. In addition, as for many other AP-1 target genes, there is a gap in the understanding of the actual composition of AP-1 complexes that bind to the endogenous IL-8 gene promoter (7Kracht M. Saklatvala J. Cytokine. 2002; 20: 91-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Several groups have addressed this point by studying the interaction of nuclear AP-1 proteins with IL-8 promoter-derived oligonucleotides in vitro using band-shift assays (22Hungness E.S. Pritts T.A. Luo G.J. Sun X. Penner C.G. Hasselgren P.O. Shock. 2000; 14: 386-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 23Freund A. Jolivel V. Durand S. Kersual N. Chalbos D. Chavey C. Vignon F. Lazennec G. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 6105-6114Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). However, these experiments cannot explain which AP-1 components interact with the two endogenous, chromatin-embedded alleles of the IL-8 gene in vivo (10Hoffmann E. Dittrich-Breiholz O. Holtmann H. Kracht M. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2002; 72: 847-855Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addressing these issues we have used the chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) technique to analyze the downstream mechanisms by which the ERK MAP kinase pathway contributes to IL-1-inducible IL-8 gene expression. Hereby, we have focused on the role of c-Fos and Fra-1, two important AP-1 proteins that are expressed in many cell types and whose role in regulation of inflammatory genes has been largely elusive. In this study, we show that IL-1 up-regulates c-Fos and Fra-1 in an ERK-dependent manner, a process that involves Fra-1 stabilization and ubiquitination. Furthermore, we show that c-Fos and Fra-1 bind to the endogenous IL-8 promoter and provide compelling evidence for a hitherto unrecognized role of Fra-1 in inducible expression of IL-8. Importantly, we find that Fra-1 counteracts the positive regulatory role of c-Fos and p65 NF-κB on IL-8 gene expression. These data provide a mechanism of how c-Fos and Fra-1 enable transcriptional regulation of IL-8 to different levels in response to two physiological inducers of IL-8, namely IL-1 and EGF. Thus, our study establishes an example of how an activated MAP kinase pathway connects to two AP-1 proteins that regulate inflammatory gene expression.

HEK293IL-R and HeLa cells (seeded at 5 × 105 per well of 6-well plates) were transfected with a total of 5.25 to 6.25 DNA μg by the calcium phosphate method. KB cells (seeded at 1 × 105 in 12 wells) were transfected with 8.25 μg of total DNA and 16 μl of JETPEI (Biomol). In all transfections the DNA amount was kept constant by adding empty pCS3MT. Determination of luciferase reporter gene activity was performed as described (27Holtmann H. Winzen R. Holland P. Eickemeier S. Hoffmann E. Wallach D. Malinin N.L. Cooper J.A. Resch K. Kracht M. Mol.

Proteins bound to DNA were cross-linked in vivo by replacement of the medium with warm PBS including 1% formaldehyde. After incubation for 1 min at room temperature, this solution was replaced by warm PBS including 0.125 m glycine to stop cross-linking. Then the supernatant was removed, and the cells were washed in and scraped into ice-cold PBS. Cells were collected at 500 × g at 4 °C, washed again in ice-cold PBS, and then lysed in ChIP-radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 1 mm EDTA, and freshly added 1% aprotinin). Lysates were cleared by sonification (4 × 1 min on ice) and centrifuged at 15,000 × g at 4 °C for 20 min. Supernatants were collected and stored in aliquots at -80 °C for subsequent ChIP. 4–10 μl of antibodies were added to 250–500 μl of lysates, and the mixture was rotated at 4 °C overnight. Then 40 μl of a protein A/G mixture preequilibrated in ChIP radioimmune precipitation assay buffer was added to the lysates, and incubation was continued for 1 h at 4 °C. Beads were collected by centrifugation and washed 2 times in 1.4 ml of ChIP-radioimmune precipitation assay buffer, once in high salt buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 2 m NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholate, 1 mm EDTA), once in ChIP-radioimmune precipitation assay buffer, and once in TE buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA) and finally resuspended in 55 μl of elution buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 1% SDS). Samples were vigorously mixed for 15min at 30 °C and then centrifuged. 50 μl of supernatant was diluted to 200 μl with TE buffer including RNase A (50 μg/ml). Similarly, 50 μl of the initial lysate (input samples) were diluted to 200 μl with TE buffer including 1% SDS and 50 μg/ml RNase A. After 30 min at 37 °C, proteinase K was added (0.5 mg/ml), and both input and immunoprecipitates were incubated for at least 6 h at 37 °C followed by at least 6 h at 65 °C. Samples were diluted to 500 μl in loading buffer PB (Qiagen), and DNA was purified using Qiaquick spin columns (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. DNA was eluted with TE buffer and stored at -20 °C until further use. PCR was performed on input and immunoprecipitated DNA using 2.5 units of HotStart Taq polymerase (Qiagen), 1 μm sense and antisense primer, 2.5–3 μl of template DNA, 0.2 mm dNTPs in a total volume of 30 μl. PCR cycles were 15 min at 95 °C and 34–36 cycles of 94 °C (20 s), 55–60 °C (20 s), 72 °C (20 s) followed by a final extension reaction at 72 °C for 7 min. PCR products were separated by agarose gel electrophoresis, visualized by ethidium bromide staining, and fluorescence intensities of bands were quantified using a Biometra TI5 system (Biometra) and the BioDocAnalyse software, Version 1.0 (Biometra). Selected ChIP results were quantified by real time PCR using a light cycler 1.0 instrument (Roche Applied Science) as indicated in the legends to Figs. 5 and 7C. The reaction mixture contained 3–4 μl of ChIP or input DNA, 0.5 μm primers, and 4 μl of the light cycler DNA Master SYBR Green I kit (Roche Applied Science) in a total volume of 20 μl. PCR cycles were 10 min at 95 °C, 40 cycles of 95 °C for 10 s, 60 °C for 10 s, and 72 °C for 10 s. Melting curve analysis revealed a single PCR product. Serial dilutions of input DNA revealed that PCR reactions were linear from 100 to 0.1 ng and were used to calculate absolute amounts of PCR products by the light cycler software. ChIP primers for the IL-8 gene (accession number M28130) were as follows: IL-8 promoter (sense, nucleotides 1303–1325, 5′-aagaaaactttcgtcatactccg-3′; antisense, nucleotides 1450–1473, 5′-tggctttttatatcatcaccctac-3′); IL-8 upstream region (sense, nucleotides 407–430, 5′-atcatgggtcctcagaggtcagac-3′; antisense, nucleotides 519–543, 5′-ggtgggagggaggtgttatctaatg-3′).Fig. 7EGF strongly induces c-Fos and Fra-1 proteins and their recruitment to the endogenous IL-8 promoter in a PD98059-dependent manner. KB cells were stimulated for the indicated times with EGF (50 ng/ml). Where indicated cells were treated with PD98059 (50 μm) for 1 h or left untreated. Thereafter cells were lysed in SDS sample buffer (A), proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, and c-Fos and Fra-1 proteins were detected by Western blotting. In B chromatin from cells treated as in A was prepared, and recruitment of c-Fos or Fra-1 to the endogenous IL-8 promoter was detected by chromatin immunoprecipitation using c-Fos and Fra-1 antibodies as described under “Experimental Procedures.” In C, PCR products of c-Fos and Fra-1 ChIP experiments were quantified by real time PCR. Shown is one representative out of two experiments. Gray bars represent treatment with PD98059.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Reverse Transcription-PCR—1 μg of total RNA was prepared as described below and transcribed into cDNA using Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) in a total volume of 40 μl. 5 μl of this reaction mixture were used to amplify cDNAs using assays on demand (Applied Biosystems) for IL-8 (Hs00174103), c-Fos (Hs00170630), Fra-1 (Hs00759776), and β-actin (Hs00174103) and an ABI7500 real time PCR instrument. The threshold cycle (ct) for each individual PCR product was calculated by the instrument software, and ct values obtained for IL-8, c-Fos, and Fra-1 were normalized by subtracting the ct values obtained for β-actin. The resulting Δct values were then used to calculate relative changes of mRNA expression as the ratio (R) of mRNA expression of stimulated/unstimulated cells according to the equation, R = 2-(Δct(stimulated)-Δct(unstimulated)). In Vivo Ubiquitination Assay—This assay was performed essentially as described in Treier et al. (26Treier M. Staszewski L.M. Bohmann D. Cell. 1994; 78: 787-798Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (846) Google Scholar). Briefly, one 75-cm2 flask of cells were transfected with 12.5 μg of pMT107-His6-ubiquitin and expression vectors as indicated in the legend of Fig. 5. The total amount of DNA (37.5 μg) was kept constant by adding empty pCS3MT. After 48 h cells were lysed in 1 ml of lysis buffer (6 m guanidine-HCl, 0.1 m NaH2PO4, 0.01 m Tris, pH 8.0). Lysates were sonicated to shear DNA. Then 900 μl of lysates were incubated with 25 μl of Ni2+-agarose beads overnight at room temperature. Beads were collected by centrifugation, washed 3 times in buffer A (8 m urea, 0.1 m NaH2PO4, 0.01 m Tris, pH 8.0), 3 times in buffer B (8 m urea, 0.1 m NaH2PO4, 0.01 m Tris, pH 6.2), and 1 time in PBS. Beads were collected by centrifugation, and proteins were eluted by boiling them for 5 min at 95 °C in SDS-PAGE sample buffer. For input controls proteins from 100 μl of cell lysates were precipitated by adding 100 μl of 10% trichloroacetic acid. Samples were incubated at 4 °C overnight. The protein pellet was collected by centrifugation at 15,000 × g at 4 °C for 15 min, washed twice in ethanol, and dried in a Speed Vac. Proteins were redissolved by boiling in SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Purified and input proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, and Fra-1 and MEK1 were detected by immunoblotting with the appropriate antibodies. Western Blotting—Cells were lysed either in Triton cell lysis buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.05, 30 mm NaPPi, 50 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm Na3VO4, 50 mm NaF, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, and freshly added 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.5 μg/ml pepstatin, 400 nm okadaic acid) or in SDS sample buffer, or nuclei and cytosolic extracts were prepared as described (27Holtmann H. Winzen R. Holland P. Eickemeier S. Hoffmann E. Wallach D. Malinin N.L. Cooper J.A. Resch K. Kracht M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6742-6753Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). Cell extract proteins were separated on 10% SDS-PAGE and electrophoretically transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Immobilon®, Millipore). After blocking with 5% dried milk in Tris-buffered saline overnight, membranes were incubated for 4–24 h with primary antibodies, washed in Tris-buffered saline, and incubated for 2–4 h with the peroxidase-coupled secondary antibody. Proteins were detected by using the Amersham Biosciences enhanced chemiluminescence system. Coimmunoprecipitation—Cells were transfected or treated as indicated in the figure legends. After 1 day cells were lysed in Triton cell lysis buffer. 2 μg of Fra-1 or HDAC1 antibody was added to 500–1000 μg of cell extract. After 16 h at 4 °C, protein A-Sepharose was added for another h. Pellets were washed 3× in immunoprecipitation buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 154 mm NaCl, 50 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1% Triton X-100). Proteins were eluted with SDS sample buffer and detected by Western blot. Small Interfering RNA Experiments—Cells were seeded in 24-well plates at 6.5 × 104/ml. At 70% confluency cells were washed 2× in serum-free medium and transfected with 200 nm concentrations of a mixture of 3 double-stranded RNA oligonucleotides directed against Fra-1 using Gene silencer reagent (Peqlab) in a total volume of 500 μl. After 4 h, 500 μl of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and 10% serum were added. The next day cells were treated as indicated and lysed, and protein expression was determined by Western blot. Small interfering RNA against Fra-1 (accession number X16707) was designed and produced by Eurogentec. Specificity for Fra-1 was confirmed by BLAST search. The sequences of the small interfering RNA oligonucleotides were as follows (duplex 1, 5′-GGCCUUGUGAACAGAUCAGdTdT-3′, 5′-CUGAUCUGUUCACAAGGCCdTdT-3′; duplex 2, 5′-GCAUCAACACCAUGAGUGGdTdT-3′, 5′-CCACUCAUGGUGUUGAUGCdTdT-3′; duplex 3, 5′-GAUGAGAAAUCAGGGCUGCdTdT-3′, 5′-GCAGCCCAGAUUUCUCAUCdTdT-3′). Oligonucleotide DNA Microarray Experiments—The microarray used in this study was the first version of the Inflammation Array (MWG Biotech) and contained 110 oligonucleotide probes for inflammatory genes that were previously validated by our laboratory (24Holzberg D. Knight C.G. Dittrich-Breiholz O. Schneider H. Dorrie A. Hoffmann E. Resch K. Kracht M. J. Biol.

Total RNA from cells treated as indicated in the legend of Table I was purified with a Qiagen RNeasy kit followed by “on column” DNase I digestion (Qiagen). RNA was used to prepare Cy3-labeled cRNA by oligo(dT)-T7-primed double-stranded cDNA synthesis (cDNA synthesis system, Roche Applied Science) followed by in vitro transcription with T7 polymerase (MEGAscript T7 kit, Ambion) as directed by the manufacturer. cRNA yield was determined photometrically. Equal amounts of cRNAs derived from ∼2.5 μg of total RNA were hybridized individually to microarrays in pre-prepared hybridization solution (MWG Biotech) at 42 °C overnight and then washed sequentially in 2× SSC (1× SSC = 0.15 m NaCl and 0.015 m sodium citrate), 0.1% SDS, 1× SSC, and 0.5× SSC. Hybridized arrays were scanned at maximal resolution on an Affymetrix 428 scanner at variable photomultiplier voltage settings. Fluorescence intensity values from Cy3 channels were processed using Imagene 4.2 software (Biodiscovery). To obtain maximal signal intensities without saturation effects, intensity values from TIFF images were integrated into one value per probe and normalized by the MAVI software (Version Pro 2.5.1, MWG Biotech).Table ISensitivity of inflammatory genes to MAP kinase inhibition in epidermal carcinoma cells and in primary fibroblasts Open table in a new tab Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay—IL-8 protein concentrations in the cell culture medium were determined using the human IL-8 duo set kit (R&D Systems) exactly as directed in the manufacturer's instructions. Partial Suppression of IL-1-induced IL-8 mRNA and Protein Expression by PD98059—Initially we compared the effects of the MAP kinase inhibitors SB203580, SP600125, and PD98059 on IL-1-inducible gene expression in the human epidermal carcinoma cell line, KB, and in human primary fibroblasts. As shown in Table I, we detected 22 genes that were induced by at least 2-fold in both cell types. As exp"

However, the molecular link between p53 and the minus end-directed microtubule motor dynein complex has not been described. We report here that the 8-kDa light chain (LC8) of dynein binds to p53-binding protein 1 (53BP1). The LC8-binding domain was mapped to a short peptide segment immediately N-terminal to the kinetochore localization region of 53BP1. The LC8-binding domain is completely separated from the p53-binding domain in 53BP1. Therefore, 53BP1 can potentially act as an adaptor to assemble p53 to the dynein complex. Unlike other known LC8-binding proteins, 53BP1 contains two distinct LC8-binding motifs that are arranged in tandem. We further showed that 53BP1 can directly associate with the dynein complex. Disruption of the interaction between LC8 and 53BP1 in vivo prevented DNA damage-induced nuclear accumulation of p53.

There are also multiple “(S/T)Q” motifs in the N-terminal region of 53BP1, and some of these (S/T)Q motifs have been shown to be phosphorylation sites of ataxia telangiectasia-mutated kinase (5Anderson L.

Disruption of the motor activity of dynein by microinjection of an antibody against the intermediate chain (IC74) of the motor or overexpressing dynamitin (p50) results in impaired accumulation of p53 in the nucleus following DNA damage (20Giannakakou P.

The molecular basis of dynein-mediated p53 nuclear trafficking is poorly understood, because p53 is not known to bind directly to the dynein motor complex. One would expect that certain adaptor protein(s) can act as a linker to couple p53 to the dynein motor. Identification of such adaptor protein(s) should provide insights into the dynein-mediated p53 nuclear trafficking. Recently, it was shown that hsp90/immunophilin complex might act as an adaptor to link p53 to a subunit of dynactin within the dynein motor complex in human colon cancer cells (22Galigniana M.D. Harrell J.M.

The base of the motor complex contains two 74-kDa intermediate chains (IC74), four light intermediate chains (52–61 kDa), and several light chains (10–25 kDa) (23Holzbaur E.L. Vallee R.B. Annu. Rev.

Biochemical dissection studies reveal that 53BP1 contains two distinct LC8-binding motifs that are arranged in tandem. Formation of the LC8·53BP1·p53 and 53BP1·LC8·dynein complexes suggests that 53BP1 can function to link p53 to the dynein complex. Disruption of the interaction between LC8 and 53BP1 in vivo prevented DNA damage-induced nuclear accumulation of p53. The data described in this work provide a distinct mechanism for dynein-mediated p53 nuclear trafficking.MATERIALS AND METHODSYeast Two-hybrid Screening—Two-hybrid screening was performed as described previously (31Naisbitt S. Valtschanoff J. Allison D.W. Sala C. Kim E. Craig A.M. Weinberg R.J. Sheng M. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 4524-4534Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, LC8 was cloned into pBHA (LexA fusion vector) and used to screen ∼1 × 106 clones of a human cDNA library constructed in pGAD10 (GAL4 activation vector, Clontech).Expression Constructs—The plasmid containing the full-length 53BP1 with an N-terminal hemagglutinin (HA) epitope and a histidine tag (pCMH6K53BP1) were provided by Dr. Kuniyoshi Iwabuchi. Truncation and deletion mutants of 53BP1 were generated by PCR cloning. The plasmid encoding GFP-fused p53 (GFP-p53) was provided by Dr. Randy Poon.For bacterial expression of 53BP1 and its truncation mutants, the corresponding DNA fragments were individually cloned into the EcoRI/XhoI sites of the pGEX-4T1 expression vector (Amersham Biosciences). The GST-fused LC8 bacterial expression vector was generated by inserting LC8-coding DNA into the pGEX-4T1 vector by PCR cloning. The histidine-tagged p53 truncation mutant was constructed by inserting the p53 encoding gene into the EcoRI/BamHI sites of an in-house-modified pET32a vector.Expression and Purification of Fusion Proteins—Bacterial expression of recombinant proteins was carried out using Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) as the host cells. To express GST-LC8 (or GST-53BP1), host cells containing the expression plasmid were grown in LB medium at 37 °C to an A600 of ∼0.8. Expression of the fusion protein was induced by the addition of isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to a final concentration of ∼0.25 mm. Protein expression continued for ∼3 h at 37 °C before harvesting by centrifugation. The fusion proteins were expressed in soluble forms and purified using GSH-Sepharose affinity columns (Amersham Biosciences) following the manufacturer's instructions. The eluted proteins were dialyzed against phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) to remove the residual GSH. The dialyzed proteins were directly used for binding assay experiments. Expression of His6-p53 proteins followed the procedure described for the expression of GST-LC8. His6-p53 was purified by passing the cell lysate through a Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid affinity column (Novagen). The N-terminal His tag of the fusion protein was cleaved by thrombin digestion. The cleaved His tag and other contaminating proteins were removed by passing the digestion mixture through a gel-filtration column. Preparation of purified, untagged LC8 has been described in our earlier work (38Fan J.S. Zhang Q. Li M. Tochio H. Yamazaki T. Shimizu M. Zhang M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33472-33481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar).Cell Cultures and Transfection—HEK293 and H1299 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified essential medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen) and penicillin/streptomycin at 37 °C in a humidified, 5% CO2 incubator. For transient transfection, cells were plated on a 10-cm Petri dish (Falcon) to ∼70% confluence and then were transfected with an appropriate amount of DNA using a Lipofectamine transfection kit (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's instructions. Transient expression of transfected proteins was allowed to continue for 24–48 h.Immunoblot Analysis—Anti-HA monoclonal antibody was purchased from Sigma, Anti-IC74 antibody was provided to us by Dr. K. Kevin Pfister, and anti-p150Glued antibody was from BD Biosciences. SDS-PAGE gel-resolved proteins were electrotransferred to a nitrocellulose membrane in a transferring buffer. Membranes were incubated with 10% skim milk, 0.1% Tween 20 in Tris-buffered saline and then probed with respective antibodies. Protein bands on Western blots were visualized by an enhanced chemiluminescent detection kit (ECL, Amersham Biosciences).Pull-down Experiments—GST-LC8 (10 μg each) was mixed with HEK293 cell lysates (100 μg of total protein) containing HA-tagged full-length 53BP1 or HA-tagged 53BP1 truncation mutants. The GST-LC8-containing complexes were precipitated with fresh GSH-Sepharose beads. The pelleted beads were washed extensively with PBS buffer and subsequently boiled with 2× SDS-PAGE sample buffer. The proteins were first resolved by SDS-PAGE and subsequently analyzed by immunoblot analysis. The assay of the direct binding between LC8 and various purified GST fusion proteins followed the same method as described in our earlier work (34Lo K.W. Naisbitt S. Fan J.S. Sheng M. Zhang M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14059-14066Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar).HIV-1 Tat Fusion Peptide Experiments—The following peptides were synthesized and HPLC-purified. The underlined sequences of the peptides correspond to the protein transduction domain of HIV-1 Tat amino acid 47–57 (Tat). YGRKKRRQRRRSYSKSTQTT (Tat-KSTQTT) and YGRKKRRQRRRSYSKSAAAT (Tat-KSAAAT). H1299 cells transfected with GFP-p53 were washed with PBS and replenished with fresh Dulbecco's modified essential medium. Adriamycin (ADR, 0.4 μg/ml) and different concentrations of Tat-peptides were added into the medium and incubated at 37 °C for 60 min. Fresh fetal bovine serum was added to the cells to a final concentration of 10%, and cells were cultured for another 2 h. At this point, the cells were washed twice with PBS, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde/PBS, and permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100/PBS. The nuclei were stained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole and then examined by fluorescence microscopy.RESULTSIdentification of 53BP1 as a LC8-binding Protein—A yeast two-hybrid screen of a human brain cDNA library using LC8 as the bait was carried out to identify potential LC8-binding proteins. Among many positive clones identified (34Lo K.W. Naisbitt S. Fan J.S. Sheng M. Zhang M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14059-14066Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), one encodes a fragment of 53BP1 (residues 1047–1313, Fig. 1A). The interaction between LC8 and 53BP1 was confirmed in an in vitro pull-down experiment (Fig. 1B). When expressed in HEK293 cells, the 53BP1 fragment isolated from the yeast two-hybrid screen was shown to interact robustly with GST-LC8 (Fig. 1B, lane 1 in the second panel). In addition, HA-tagged, full-length 53BP1 could be specifically and robustly pelleted by purified recombinant GST-LC8 attached to GSH-Sepharose beads (Fig. 1B, lane 1 in the first panel). When the two proteins were co-expressed in HEK293 cells, 53BP1 and LC8 formed a tight complex that could be efficiently immunoprecipitated from cell lysates (Fig. 1C, lane 1).The LC8-binding fragment of 53BP1 isolated from the yeast two-hybrid screen partially overlapped with the KLR domain of the protein. Removal of the amino acid residues that overlap with the KLR domain (residues 1178–1313) generated a 65-residue peptide fragment corresponding to amino acid residues 1113–1177 of 53BP1. This 65-residue fragment was found to bind robustly to LC8 (Fig. 1B, lane 1 in the third panel). Deletion of this 65-residue fragment from the full-length 53BP1 completely abolished its binding to LC8 (Fig. 1B, lane 1 in the bottom panel). Taken together, the data in Fig. 1 demonstrate that 53BP1 can specifically bind to LC8, and the 65-residue fragment N-terminal to the KLR domain is necessary and sufficient for 53BP1 to bind to LC8.53BP1 Contains Two Distinct LC8-binding Motifs—In our earlier work, we showed that LC8 binds to multiple target proteins via a consensus (R/K)XTQT motif (where “X” is variable amino acids) (Fig. 2A and Ref. 34Lo K.W. Naisbitt S. Fan J.S. Sheng M. Zhang M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14059-14066Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Inspection of the amino acid sequence reveals that the 1169AATQT1173 sequence within the 65-residue LC8-binding fragment of 53BP1 resembles this consensus LC8-binding motif (Fig. 2C). To determine whether the 1169AATQT1173 sequence is indeed the LC8-binding motif of 53BP1, we deleted three residues (TQT) from the 65-residue LC8-binding fragment of 53BP1 (Fig. 2C). Earlier biochemical and structural studies indicated that deletion of the TQT cassette from the consensus (R/K)XTQT motif was sufficient to disrupt its LC8-binding capacity (34Lo K.W. Naisbitt S. Fan J.S. Sheng M. Zhang M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14059-14066Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 36Fan J.S. Zhang Q. Tochio H. Li M. Zhang M. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 306: 97-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). To our surprise, the 1171ΔTQT1173 deletion mutant of 53BP1 could still bind to LC8 (Fig. 2D, second lane). This outcome suggested that either the 1169AATQT1173 sequence is not the authentic LC8-binding motif or this sequence is not the only LC8-binding motif. It is known that some LC8 target proteins do not contain the (R/K)XTQT motif in their LC8-binding domains (31Naisbitt S. Valtschanoff J. Allison D.W. Sala C. Kim E. Craig A.M. Weinberg R.J. Sheng M.

FEBS Lett. 2001; 503: 135-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). For example, the 239GIQVD243 sequence of neuronal nitric-oxide synthase (nNOS) plays a central role in the binding of the enzyme to LC8 (36Fan J.S. Zhang Q. Tochio H. Li M. Zhang M. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 306: 97-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 39Liang J. Jaffrey S.R. Guo W. Snyder S.H. Clardy J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 735-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). We also found that another LC8-binding protein, GKAP, contains two GIQVD-like motifs (Fig. 2B) and that both motifs are involved in LC8-binding. 2K. W.-H. Lo, H.-M. Kan, and M. Zhang, our unpublished data. The 65-residue LC8-binding fragment of 53BP1 also contains a GIQVD-like motif (1153GIQTM1157). This motif is located slightly upstream of the 1169AATQT1173 motif (Fig. 2, B and C). To test if the 1153GIQTM1157 motif of 53BP1 plays an active role in LC8 binding, we deleted the 1153GIQ1155 cassette from the 65-residue LC8-binding segment of 53BP1 and assayed the LC8-binding capacity of the mutant. Again, based on earlier structural and mutagenesis studies, deletion of the GIQ-cassette would abrogate the GIQVD motif-mediated LC8 binding (36Fan J.S. Zhang Q. Tochio H. Li M. Zhang M. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 306: 97-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 39Liang J. Jaffrey S.R. Guo W. Snyder S.H. Clardy J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 735-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). In contrast to our prediction, the 1153GIQ1155-deletion mutant of 53BP1 also interacted with LC8 (Fig. 2D, first lane), indicating the involvement of other regions of 53BP1 in LC8 binding. We next generated a double deletion mutant with both the 1153GIQ1155 and the 1171TQT1173 cassettes removed. This double mutant showed no detectable LC8 binding (Fig. 2D, third lane). Taken together, we conclude that 53BP1 contains two distinct LC8-binding motifs with amino acid sequences of 1153GIQTM1157 and 1169AATQT1173.Fig. 253BP1 contains two distinct LC8-binding motifs. A, amino acid sequence alignment of LC8-binding domains from selected target proteins containing the consensus (K/R)XTQT motif. The (K/R)XTQT-like sequence of 53BP1 is shown at the bottom. B, sequence alignment of GIQVD motifs of selected LC8-binding proteins. The GIQVD-like motif of 53BP1 is indicated at the bottom of the panel.

The lane labeled “GST” serves as a negative control.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)We expect that the 1169AATQT1173 motif of 53BP1 binds to LC8 in an essentially identical manner as does the (R/K)XTQT motif, because we earlier showed that mutation of the positively charged Arg/Lys in the motif to an Ala introduced very limited changes to LC8 binding (34Lo K.W. Naisbitt S. Fan J.S. Sheng M. Zhang M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14059-14066Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Therefore, we chose not to characterize the interaction between the 1169AATQT1173 motif of 53BP1 and LC8 in further detail. In contrast, the nature of the interaction between the 1153GIQTM1157 motif of 53BP1 and LC8 remains uncertain because of the sequence divergence between this motif and the LC8-binding domain of nNOS (the only well characterized LC8-binding protein without an (R/K)XTQT motif). We next studied the interaction between the 1153GIQTM1157 motif of 53BP1 and LC8 in more detail. To test the binding of the GIQTM motif to LC8, we used a 13-residue synthetic peptide corresponding to 1149QNNIGIQTMECSL1161 of 53BP1 (called the GIQ-peptide here), and titrated 15N-labeled LC8 with the peptide using NMR spectroscopy. In the presence of sub-stoichiometric amount of the GIQ-peptide, we observed two distinct sets of backbone amide peaks in the 1H,15N HSQC spectra of LC8/peptide mixtures. These two sets of resonances correspond to the peptide-bound form and the free form of LC8. The slow exchange of the peptide-bound form and the free form of LC8 observed in the NMR sample tube indicate that the GIQ-peptide binds to LC8 with high affinity. The LC8 dimer was saturated upon addition of a two molar ratio of the GIQ-peptide (Fig. 3A), indicating that each LC8 dimer binds to two molecules of the GIQ-peptide. The specificity of the binding of the GIQ-peptide to LC8 was further demonstrated by the does-dependent competition between the GIQ-peptide and the full-length 53BP1 for binding to LC8 (Fig. 4A).Fig. 3The GIQ-peptide of 53BP1 binds to LC8 with high affinity. A, superposition plot of the 1H,15N HSQC spectra of free (black) and the GIQ-peptide saturated (red) LC8. The assignment of the free form LC8 is labeled with each amino acid residue name and number. B, plot as a function of the residue number of combined 1H and 15N chemical shift changes of LC8 induced by the GIQ-peptide binding. The combined 1H and 15N chemical shift changes are defined as: Δppm = [(ΔδHN)2 + (ΔδN × αN)2]1/2, where ΔδHN and ΔδN represent chemical shift differences of amide proton and nitrogen chemical shifts of free LC8 and the protein in complex with the GIQ-peptide, respectively. The scaling factor (αN) used to normalize the 1H and 15N chemical shifts is 0.17. The secondary structure of LC8 is indicated at the top of the plot. The inset shows the amplitude (in pseudo-color scale) of the GIQ-peptide-induced chemical shift changes of LC8 mapped on to the three-dimensional structure of the LC8 dimer.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Fig. 4Synthetic peptides containing either class of LC8-binding motifs specifically compete with 53BP1 for binding to LC8. A, the GIQ-peptide competes with 53BP1 for LC8 in a dose-dependent manner. Due to the limited solubility of the GIQ-peptide in the aqueous buffer, a peptide stock solution was prepared by dissolving the sample in Me2SO. The volume of Me2SO was kept to <5% of the total volume and remained the same in each assay mixture. B, the KSTQT-peptide competes for binding to with 53BP1 for LC8 in a similar dose-dependent manner as the GIQ-peptide. C, substitution of the critical TQT cassette with the AAA cassette in the KSTQT-peptide completely abolished the LC8-binding capacity of the peptide.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)We next investigated which regions of LC8 are involved in the GIQ-peptide binding. We used the well established minimum chemical shift perturbation approach to map the GIQ-peptide-binding region on LC8 by taking the advantage of complete chemical shift assignment of the free form of LC8 (36Fan J.S. Zhang Q. Tochio H. Li M. Zhang M. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 306: 97-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Fig. 3B summarizes the chemical shift changes of LC8 induced by the GIQ-peptide binding. The inset in Fig. 3B shows the GIQ-peptide-induced chemical shift changes mapped on to the backbone structure of the LC8 dimer (36Fan J.S. Zhang Q. Tochio H. Li M. Zhang M. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 306: 97-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The data clearly show that amino acid residues in the β2-strand, β1/β2-loop, β2/β3-loop, and the N-terminal part of α2-helix are involved in the GIQ-peptide binding. The GIQ motif peptide-induced chemical shift perturbation profile of LC8 is highly similar to that induced by the LC8-binding peptide derived from nNOS (36"

Here we show that γ-H2AX foci were also formed when cells were incubated with 0.5 μg/ml DNA intercalating agent actinomycin D. In untreated cells, γ-H2AX co-immunoprecipitated with Ku70, a subunit of DNA-dependent protein kinase, as well as with nuclear DNA helicase II (NDH II), a DEXH family helicase also known as RNA helicase A or DHX9. This association was increased manifold after actinomycin D treatment. DNA degradation diminished the amount of Ku70 associated with γ-H2AX but not that of NDH II. In vitro binding studies with recombinant NDH II and H2AX phosphorylated by DNA-dependent protein kinase confirmed a direct physical interaction between NDH II and γ-H2AX. Thereby, the NDH II DEXH domain alone, i.e. its catalytic core, was able to support binding to γ-H2AX. Congruently, after actinomycin D treatment, NDH II accumulated in RNA-containing nuclear bodies that predominantly co-localized with γ-H2AX foci. Taken together, these results suggest that histone γ-H2AX promotes binding of NDH II to transcriptionally stalled sites on chromosomal DNA. Formation of γ-H2AX foci is a P.

The histone H2A family contains three members named H2A1-H2A2, H2AZ, and H2AX (for reviews, see Refs. 1Redon C. Pilch D.R. Rogakou E.P. Sedelnikova O.A. Newrock K. Bonner W.M. Curr. Opin. Genet.

Although the situation is different in yeast, where the two H2AX orthologs HTA1 and HTA2 account for 95% of the H2A complement, in both, H2AX plays an important role in DNA repair, particularly after inducing DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) 1The abbreviations used are: DSB, double strand break; DNA-PK, DNA-dependent protein kinase; NDH II, nuclear DNA helicase II; ATM, ataxia telangiectasia-mutated; ATR, ATM and Rad 3-related; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; MNase, micrococcal nuclease.

H2AX is highly conserved in eukaryotes and contains a distinguishing C-terminal extension carrying a SQ(E/D)(I/L/F/Y) consensus motif. This motif is recognized and phosphorylated by members of the family of phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate kinase-related protein kinases, ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM), ATM and Rad 3-related (ATR), and DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) (1Redon C.

Within the SQ(E/D)(I/L/F/Y) phosphorylation motif of H2AX, serine 139, the fourth amino acid from the C-terminal end, is preferably subjected to phosphorylation. Acknowledging the physiological importance of this phosphorylation, the phosphorylated H2AX is designated γ-H2AX. The level of γ-H2AX is normally low in mammals, unless a DSB is introduced, e.g. by ionizing radiation (4Rogakou E.P. Pilch D.R. Orr A.H. Ivanova V.S. Bonner W.M. J. Biol.

Specifically, the interaction of p53BP1 and γ-H2AX may be important for the activation of cell cycle checkpoints after DNA damage, such as that mediated by ATM, which phosphorylates the downstream targets p53, CHK2, and SMC1 (14Abraham R.T. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: E277-E279Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Although ATM, ATR, and DNA-PK are all able to phosphorylate H2AX, the three kinases seem to signal in different cellular responses. In this respect, ATM has been found to be responsible for phosphorylation of H2AX in response to DSBs caused by ionizing irradiation (15Burma S. Chen B.P. Murphy M. Kurimasa A. Chen D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42462-42467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1495) Google Scholar), whereas ATR seems to be required for phosphorylation of H2AX on a stalled replication fork, induced by e.g. hydroxyurea or UV irradiation (16Ward I.M. Chen J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47759-47762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (928) Google Scholar). Further results suggest that ATR may be activated by single-stranded DNA coated with replication protein A. The presence of a single strand of DNA of sufficient length seems to be a prerequisite for the recruitment and activation of ATR (17Ward I.M. Minn K. Chen J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 9677-9680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar), which leads to phosphorylation of Chk1 in a checkpoint pathway that depends on Rad17 and the proliferating cell nuclear antigen-like Rad9-Hus1-Rad1 complex (18Wang Y. Qin J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 15387-15392Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Actinomycin D is an anti-tumor drug that particularly inter-calates into transcriptionally active regions of chromosomal DNA and thereby abrogates RNA synthesis (19Sobell H.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 5328-5331Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). Using actinomycin D at a concentration to inhibit transcription, i.e. 0.5 μg/ml, we observed induction of γ-H2AX foci formation. The presence of γ-H2AX in transcriptionally active chromatin was substantiated by an association with RNA polymerase II, as demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation. Nevertheless, whereas a prolonged actinomycin D treatment led to degradation of RNA polymerase II, it also enhanced the association of the newly formed γ-H2AX to Ku70 and to NDH II. We found that DNA mediated Ku70 association to γ-H2AX, whereas NDH II was directly bound to γ-H2AX via protein-protein interactions. The presence of NDH II in these complexes is not surprising, as NDH II has been shown to be a substrate of DNA-PK (20Zhang S. Schlott B. Gorlach M. Grosse F. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) and is hypothesized to play a functional role in transcription.

If low doses of actinomycin D would solely distort DNA structures at transcriptionally active sites, there may exist a cellular response to disarranged transcriptionally active DNA. This response may invoke DNA-PK phosphorylation of H2AX and may promote recruitment of NDH II to γ-H2AX foci. Antibodies—A mouse monoclonal antibody against γ-H2AX (JBW301) was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology (Charlottesville, Virginia). The mouse monoclonal antibody against the catalytic subunit of DNA-PK (DNA-PKcs) (25-4) was from NeoMarkers (Fremont, CA). A goat polyclonal antibody against ATR (N-19), a rabbit polyclonal antibody against the N terminus of the large subunit of RNA polymerase II (N-20), and mouse monoclonal antibodies against Ku70 (A-9) or p53 (D0–1) were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). A mouse monoclonal antibody (8WG16) against RNA polymerase II was from Covance (Princeton, NJ). Rabbit antiserum against NDH II has been described previously (22Zhang S. Maacke H. Grosse F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16422-16427Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Proteins—Recombinant human H2AX was obtained from Upstate Biotechnology (Charlottesville, Virginia). DNA-PK purified from human cells was purchased from Promega (Madison, WI). Full-length human NDH II (amino acids 1–1269) and its deletion versions comprising amino acids 1–952, 313–1269, and 313–952 were generated in our laboratory and have been described previously (24Zhang S. Grosse F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11487-11494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). All of these NDH II recombinant proteins carried His6 tags at their N termini and were expressed from recombinant baculoviruses in Sf9 insect cells. glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins containing the N terminus (amino acids 1–312) and C terminus (amino acids 953–1269) of NDH II were as described previously (24Zhang S. Grosse F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11487-11494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Cell Culture—Human HeLa and HEp2 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (C.C.Pro GmbH, Neustadt/Weinstrasse, Germany) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen). Human MCF-7 cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. All cell lines were cultured in an incubator with 10% CO2 at 37 °C. Actinomycin D, when applied, was added to the cell medium to a concentration of 0.5 μg/ml, followed by further incubation for 3.5 h, if not indicated otherwise. Immunofluorescence—Cells attached to a coverslip were washed one time with cold PBS (10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, 140 mm NaCl, and 3 mm KCl) and then treated with Nonidet P-40 (0.5% in PBS) for 15 min on ice, followed by fixation with 4% formaldehyde in PBS for 15 min. Alternatively, the cells were directly fixed without pretreatment by Nonidet P-40. The fixed cells were permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS for 15 min and then blocked with 5% bovine serum albumin (fraction V, Sigma) in PBS for 30 min at room temperature. Subsequent steps were as described previously (25Zhang S. Herrmann C. Grosse F. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 2693-2703PubMed Google Scholar). The mouse monoclonal antibody against γ-H2AX (JBW301) was diluted 1:100 and the rabbit antiserum against NDH II, 1:1000. Immunofluorescence was observed at a 100-fold magnification with a Zeiss Axiovert 135 microscope in connection with a Sony charge-coupled device color video camera. For confocal microscopy, we used a Zeiss LSM 510 laser scanning confocal microscope at 63× magnification. All microscopic data were processed by Adobe Photoshop and Canvas. Western Blot—After electrophoresis through an SDS-polyacrylamide gel, the proteins were transferred to a Hybond-C extra nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham Biosciences) using a semidry electroblotter. For immunodetection, a dilution of 1:1000 was used for the mouse monoclonal antibodies against γ-H2AX (JBW301) and Ku70 (A-9) or the rabbit polyclonal antibodies against RNA polymerase II (N-20) and nuclear DNA helicase II. A dilution of 1:500 was used for the mouse monoclonal antibody against RNA polymerase II (8WG16) and 1:200 for the mouse monoclonal antibodies against DNA-PKcs (25–4) and p53 (DO-1), or the goat polyclonal antibody against ATR (N-19). Secondary antibodies coupled to avidin or a streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase complex, both diluted at 1:5000, were applied for enhanced luminescence immunodetection (Amersham Biosciences). Immunoprecipitation—HeLa cells, untreated or treated with actinomycin D, were pelleted by centrifugation at 320 × g for 10 min. After washing with PBS and recentrifugation, the harvested cells (∼0.5 ml/pellet) were disrupted by four passages through a 25-gauge needle in 1 ml of 20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.2, 15 mm KCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, and the proteinase inhibitors aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin, each at 5 μg/ml. The cell suspensions were then centrifuged at 3000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. After removal of the supernatant (i.e. cytosol), the nuclear pellets were resuspended in 1 ml of 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.8, 150 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 250 mm sucrose, and the proteinase inhibitors, followed by six strokes of sonication with a Branson sonicator, each at an output setting of 20 for 4 s. The nuclear extracts were then placed on top of a cushion containing 0.88 m sucrose, prepared in the same buffer as above for resuspending the nuclei, followed by centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 15 min. Supernatants containing the nucleoplasmic components were then divided into two equal parts. The first half was mixed with the mouse antibody against γ-H2AX (JBW301, ∼15 μg) or the rabbit antiserum against NDH II (10 μl), and the second half incubated to the same amount of mouse or rabbit control IgG, respectively. The samples were incubated under rotation for 1 h at 4 °C. A 50-μl bed volume of protein A-agarose (Oncogene, Darmstadt, Germany) was added to each mixture, and the incubation was continued for another hour at 4 °C. Finally, the agarose beads were collected by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 1 min and washed three times each with a 10-fold bed volume of IP-40 buffer (50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 25 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.2% Nonidet P-40 plus proteinase inhibitors, as described above). After removal of the remaining supernatant, the agarose beads were mixed each with an equal volume (50 μl) of SDS-PAGE loading buffer and heated for 5 min at 95 °C. Co-immunoprecipitated proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. In Vitro Phosphorylation by DNA-PK—The indicated amount of H2AX was phosphorylated by DNA-PK (25 units/μl) in a reaction buffer consisting of 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 100 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EGTA, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 mm ATP, 0.07 μg/μl activated calf thymus DNA (Sigma) and 80 μg/ml bovine serum albumin. The reaction mixture was incubated for 15 min at 30 °C. H2AX phosphorylated at serine 139 was distinguished from nonphosphorylated H2AX by Western blotting with the mouse antibody against γ-H2AX (JBW301). Phosphorylation of NDH II, as well as its truncated mutants, by DNA-PK was performed as described above but with the addition of 2 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. After SDS-PAGE, the radioactive phosphorylation signals were detected by autoradiography. In Vitro Studies of Protein-Protein Interactions—1 μg of H2AX was first phosphorylated by DNA-PK as described above in a volume of 50 μl. After phosphorylation, 300 units/ml of micrococcal nuclease (MNase, Amersham Biosciences) were added to the reaction mixture, which was also supplemented with 1 mm CaCl2. Incubation for 15 min at room temperature sufficed to degrade DNA. The mixture containing γ-H2AX was then mixed with recombinant NDH II (0.5 μg) and incubated for another 15 min at room temperature. An equal volume of this protein solution was mixed with the mouse antibody against γ-H2AX (JBW301, 3.5 μg) and as control, the same amount of mouse IgG. After preincubation for 1 h at 4 °C, protein A-agarose (25-μl bed volume) was added, and incubation was continued for another hour at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitated proteins were harvested from the washed agarose beads with SDS-PAGE loading buffer, as described above for immunoprecipitation from nuclear extracts. The proteins, interacting with γ-H2AX, were examined by Western blotting. To probe the interaction with H2AX or γ-H2AX, NDH II was translated in vitro from its full-length cDNA subcloned into a pBluescript plasmid (24Zhang S. Grosse F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11487-11494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) using the TnT T7-coupled reticulocyte lysate system (Promega, Mannheim, Germany) and [35S]methionine for the radioactive labeling of NDH II. Actinomycin D Induced the Formation of Nuclear γ-H2AX Foci—Actinomycin D inhibits transcription by preferentially intercalating into GpC-rich double-stranded DNA and, as a consequence, abrogates the elongation phase of RNA synthesis in interfering with the extension of the transcription bubble (19Sobell H.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 5328-5331Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, we found that 0.5 μg/ml of this drug led to the appearance of nuclear γ-H2AX foci that so far have been taken as an indicator for the presence of DSBs (1Redon C. Pilch D.R. Rogakou E.P. Sedelnikova O.A. Newrock K. Bonner W.M. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2002; 12: 162-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (633) Google Scholar, 2Pilch D.R. Sedelnikova O.A. Redon C. Celeste A. Nussenzweig A. Bonner W.M. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2003; 81: 123-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1, A–D). To observe chromatin-bound proteins, we first extracted the cells with 0.5% Nonidet P-40 and then fixed the chromatin-bound fraction with formaldehyde (26Andegeko Y. Moyal L. Mittelman L. Tsarfaty I. Shiloh Y. Rotman G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38224-38230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After pre-extraction, γ-H2AX foci were also found in untreated cells, although at a very weak intensity (Fig. 1, E and F). The γ-H2AX fraction of normal nuclei was widely distributed as small dots, whereas the nuclear foci of actinomycin D-treated cells appeared to be larger and more intensely stained (Fig. 1, G and H). To address the possibility that γ-H2AX foci, present in cells treated with 0.5 μg/ml actinomycin D, were caused by DSBs, we extracted DNA from these cells and examined the integrity of chromosomal DNA by agarose gel electrophoresis. The results showed that some DNA strand breaks were also induced by treatment with 0.5 μg/ml actinomycin D. This was confirmed by DNA end labeling with terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase and a fluorescein-labeled deoxynucleotide (Fig. 2B). On the other hand, degradation of chromosomal DNA was much more striking when the concentration of actinomycin D was raised to 10 μg/ml (Fig. 2A). Despite this, after treatment with low doses of actinomycin D, a timely increase of γ-H2AX could be demonstrated by Western blotting of whole cell lysates (Fig. 2C). This was accompanied by a rapid degradation of RNA polymerase II and a subsequent induction of the tumor suppressor protein p53 (Fig. 2C). H2AX Was Associated with NDH II and Ku70 —To look for proteins associated with γ-H2AX induced by actinomycin D, nuclear extracts of actinomycin-treated or untreated cells were prepared for immunoprecipitation with a mouse monoclonal antibody against γ-H2AX (JBW301). The co-immunoprecipitated proteins were examined by Western blotting. Under this condition, RNA polymerase II, NDH II, and Ku70 were found to co-precipitate with γ-H2AX (Fig. 3A). Although γ-H2AX was not detected in nuclear extracts of untreated cells (Fig. 3A, input fraction), it became visible in the corresponding immunoprecipitates (Fig. 3A, γ-H2AX immunoprecipitated fraction). This is another indication that γ-H2AX, indeed, was present in untreated cells, although at a very low level. In contrast, in actinomycin D-treated cells, γ-H2AX was easily detectable in nuclear extracts and could be further enriched by immunoprecipitation (Fig. 3A, second panel from top). The amount of NDH II and Ku70 co-immunoprecipitating with γ-H2AX was substantially higher in actinomycin D-treated cells than in control cells. Unexpectedly, RNA polymerase II only seemed to coimmunoprecipitate with γ-H2AX in untreated cells. We suggest that protein degradation decreased the amount of RNA polymerase II and made it undetectable in the γ-H2AX immunoprecipitates. The potential degradation of RNA polymerase II occurred earlier, i.e. 30 min, after actinomycin D treatment. From this time point on, a diminishing amount of RNA polymerase II in association with γ-H2AX was observed (Fig. 3B). NDH II Directly Bound to γ-H2AX, whereas Association of Ku70 with γ-H2AX Was Mediated by Chromosomal DNA—Coimmunoprecipitation of γ-H2AX, Ku70, and NDH II led us to examine whether these proteins interact directly with each other or whether chromosomal DNA mediates an indirect interaction. To distinguish between these two alternatives, we immunoprecipitated γ-H2AX from actinomycin D-treated cell extracts and treated the washed precipitates with MNase. The results showed that once DNA was degraded, the presence of the otherwise co-immunoprecipitated Ku70 antigen decreased to an undetectable level, whereas the same treatment hardly affected the amount of NDH II associated with γ-H2AX (Fig. 4A). These findings strongly suggest that NDH II interacted with γ-H2AX by forming a direct protein-protein contact, whereas the interaction between Ku70 and γ-H2AX was mediated by DNA. Here, the association of γ-H2AX with Ku70, which is disrupted by degrading the DNA, was also observed in immunoprecipitates with a mouse antibody against Ku70 (Fig. 4B). To demonstrate binding of γ-H2AX to NDH II in vitro, recombinant H2AX was phosphorylated by purified DNA-PK holoenzyme. An antibody against γ-H2AX revealed a signal on Western blots only when both DNA and ATP were added to the reaction mixture (Fig. 5A). This result corroborated the essential need of both ATP and DNA for the reaction and underscored the specificity of the γ-H2AX antibody used for detecting the phosphorylated (but not the unphosphorylated) form of H2AX. To examine the binding of NDH II to γ-H2AX, the already described phosphorylation mixture was complemented with recombinant full-length NDH II after DNA degradation with MNase, followed by immunoprecipitation of γ-H2AX. Fig. 5B evidences that NDH II appears in the immunoprecipitate of γ-H2AX but not in the immunoprecipitates of unphosphorylated H2AX or the mouse Ig control. Again, Ku70 was not detectable in the immunoprecipitate of γ-H2AX. This confirms the in vivo immunoprecipitation experiment as presented in Fig. 4 and supports the conclusion that Ku70 does not directly interact with γ-H2AX or NDH II. To further distinguish whether NDH II prefers binding to either the phosphorylated or the unphosphorylated form of H2AX, this histone variant was incubated with DNA-PK in the absence or presence of ATP and spotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was then probed with in vitro- translated and [35S]methionine-labeled NDH II. This experiment confirmed that NDH II only bound to γ-H2AX, i.e. H2AX phosphorylated by DNA-PK, and not to unphosphorylated H2AX (Fig. 5C). Aiming at identifying a region of NDH II responsible for binding to γ-H2AX, several truncated forms of NDH II were generated and probed for an interaction with γ-H2AX. These NDH II variants contained either the N-terminal amino acids 1–952, with a deletion of the C terminus carrying the RGG box, or the amino acids 313–1269 with a deletion of the N terminus, including the two double-stranded RNA binding domains or the amino acids 313–952 in the middle, bearing the helicase catalytic motif. All truncated constructs of NDH II displayed binding to γ-H2AX (Fig. 5D). On the other hand, pull-down experiments with glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins containing only the N-terminal amino acids 1–313 or the C-terminal amino acids 953–1269 of NDH II had no affinity to γ-H2AX (Fig. 5E). These results led to the conclusion that the central part of NDH II, i.e. the region with the helicase signature motifs, was responsible for binding to γ-H2AX. γ-H2AX Suppressed the DNA-PK-mediated Phosphorylation of Full-length NDH II and That of Its DEXH Catalytic Core— Recently, we have shown that DNA-PK phosphorylated NDH II in vitro with either DNA or RNA as cofactor (20Zhang S. Schlott B. Gorlach M. Grosse F. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Therefore, we assumed that chromosome-associated complexes consisting of DNA-PK and γ-H2AX are also capable of phosphorylating NDH II. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments with an antibody against NDH II revealed that the helicase co-immunoprecipitated with DNA-PKcs and γ-H2AX from nuclear extracts of actinomycin D-treated cells (Fig. 6A). However, these interactions were not strong enough to maintain a stable complex that could be detected by Sephacryl S-200 gel filtration (Fig. 6B). Nevertheless, NDH II was phosphorylated by DNA-PK in a time-dependent manner when ATP and DNA were present (Fig. 6C, panel a). When this experiment was repeated in the presence of γ-H2AX, the phosphorylation of NDH II was inhibited (Fig. 6D, panel a). We further found that phosphorylation of NDH II by DNA-PK occurred within the catalytic DEXH domain, whereas the N-terminal part of NDH II was not phosphorylated (Fig. 6C, panel b). Similar to full-length NDH II, a phosphorylation of the DEXH core by DNA-PK was also inhibited by γ-H2AX (Fig. 6D, panel b). We further realized that the DNA-PK-dependent phosphorylation of NDH II led to a stimulation of the DNA-dependent ATPase activity of NDH II, which was suppressed when H2AX was present in the reaction mixture (Fig. 6E). Thus, the activity-stimulating phosphorylation of NDH II by DNA-PK could be counteracted by histone γ-H2AX. After Actinomycin D Treatment, NDH II Accumulated in RNA-containing Nuclear Bodies That Were Partially Adjacent to the γ-H2AX Foci—Because actinomycin D is capable of inducing nuclear γ-H2AX foci and NDH II displays direct interactions with γ-H2AX, it was of interest to study whether NDH II co-localizes with γ-H2AX in vivo. To answer this question, immunofluorescence studies were performed as described above by pre-treating cells with 0.5% Nonidet P-40. In untreated cells, NDH II displayed a nuclear distribution similar to that of γ-H2AX, although the signals of the latter were comparatively weak (Fig. 7, A–C). Strikingly, actinomycin D treatment led to an accumulation of NDH II into nuclear bodies that, in part, co-localized with the induced γ-H2AX foci (Fig. 7, D–F). These NDH II-containing nuclear bodies were apparently sustained by RNA, as RNase treatment caused their fragmentation into smaller particles that became distributed over the entire nucleus (Fig. 7, G–I). Possibly, these NDH II-containing structures arose as a stress response to actinomycin D, which in turn led to the termination of transcription and probably to an increased accumulation of NDH II into ribonucleoprotein complexes that contained aberrant RNA products (27Zha"

A more generalized role of this protein for cell replication is hypothesized as numerous regulatory sequences of cell cycle-related genes contain putative binding sites. In the present study the DNA polymerase α (DPA) gene is identified as another YB-1-responsive gene with a Y-box and 3′ inverted repeat sequence, designated DPA RE-1, in the serum-responsive promoter region. Overexpressed YB-1 concentration-dependently trans-activated DPA gene expression in reporter assays and Southwestern blotting as well as DNA binding analyses revealed binding of distinct endogenous proteins to the RE-1 with molecular sizes of 26, 32 and 52 kDa. Among these, YB-1 binding was confirmed using recombinant as well as endogenous proteins, with preferential single-stranded DNA binding. Early serum growth response in mesangial cells was accompanied by a nuclear YB-1 shift and nucleocomplex formation at the RE-1. Fine mapping of the DPA RE-1 sequence unraveled a dependence on co-factors for trans-regulation with gene activation in the context of a heterologous SV40 promoter but suppression in the context of the abbreviated homologous promoter sequence. A YB-1 knock down resulted in decreased DPA transcription rates and abrogated the serum-dependent induction of DPA transcription.

As eukaryotic cells progress through the cell cycle, multiple genes involved in DNA replication and nucleotide metabolism are coordinately up-regulated shortly before or at the onset of DNA synthesis. These genes among others encompass histones, dihydrofolate reductase, thymidine kinase and synthase, proliferating cell nuclear antigen, topoisomerase IIα, and DNA polymerase α (DPA) 1The abbreviations used are: DPA, DNA polymerase α; YB-1, Y-box-binding protein-1; rYB-1, recombinant YB-1 protein; MC, mesangial cell; AS, antisense; BrdUrd, bromodeoxyuridine; RE-1, response element-1; MBN, mung bean nuclease; IR, inverted repeat./primase (1Ayusawa D.

A concordant up-regulation of the transcription factor Y-box protein 1 (YB-1) with topoisomerase IIα and proliferating cell nuclear antigen has been previously reported (4Gu C. Oyama T. Osaki T. Kohno K. Yasumoto K. Anticancer Res. 2001; 21: 2357-2362PubMed Google Scholar); however, a direct involvement of YB-1 in the transcriptional control of the aforementioned genes has not been investigated. DPA is a key component of the chromosomal replication apparatus and is regarded as the principal polymerase involved in eukaryotic DNA replication (5Campbell J.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1986; 55: 733-771Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A role for DPA primase has been found in the checkpoint that couples S phase to mitosis (6D'Urso G. Grallert B. Nurse P. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 3109-3118Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, Wahl et al. (7Wahl A.F. Geis A.M. Spain B.H. Wong S.W. Korn D. Wang T.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 5016-5025Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) demonstrated a significant up-regulation of DPA gene transcription during the activation of quiescent (G0 phase) to proliferating cells (G1/S phases). Steady state DPA mRNA levels, synthesis rates of nascent polymerase protein, and enzymatic activity all exhibit a substantial increase before the peak of in vivo DNA synthesis. The concerted increase of these three parameters is consistent with the regulation of this key DNA replication enzyme to a considerable extent at the transcriptional level. Studies performed by Wang and co-workers (7Wahl A.F. Geis A.M. Spain B.H. Wong S.W. Korn D. Wang T.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 5016-5025Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 8Pearson B.E. Nasheuer H.P. Wang T.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 2081-2095Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) demonstrated that in serum-deprived cells, DPA mRNA, protein, and in vitro activity levels are low, whereas serum addition leads to a coordinate increase in parallel with the onset of DNA synthesis. Prior analyses of the GC-rich TATA-less DPA promoter sequence for cis-acting elements identified a serum response element that is activated in NIH 3T3 cells (8Pearson B.E. Nasheuer H.P. Wang T.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 2081-2095Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This element was mapped to sequences –65/–17 relative to the transcriptional start site. The 28-bp sequence –45/–17 includes an inverted CCAAT box and enhances transcription 10-fold in cycling cells when compared with the minimal activity construct –17/+45 (8Pearson B.E. Nasheuer H.P. Wang T.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 2081-2095Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Specific binding activities that trans-activate DPA gene transcription via this element include CTF1 (9Hayhurst G.P. Bryant L.A. Caswell R.C. Walker S.M. Sinclair J.H. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 182-188Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and CTF/NF-I (10Jones K.A. Kadonaga J.T. Rosenfeld P.J. Kelly T.J. Tjian R. Cell. 1987; 48: 79-89Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar). The importance of this sequence for DPA gene expression has also been demonstrated in the course of human cytomegalovirus infection. Human cytomegalovirus immediate-early protein 1 directly interacts with CTF1 and synergistically trans-activates DPA gene transcription via the inverted CCAAT box (9Hayhurst G.P. Bryant L.A. Caswell R.C. Walker S.M. Sinclair J.H. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 182-188Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Inverted CCAAT boxes also constitute binding sites for Y-box-binding proteins (11Kohno K. Izumi H. Uchiumi T. Ashizuka M. Kuwano M. BioEssays. 2003; 25: 691-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). YB-1 binds to DNA as well as RNA in a sequence-specific fashion and is implicated in the transcriptional regulation of a variety of genes (12Swamynathan S.K. Nambiar A. Guntaka R.V. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 515-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Depending on the cellular context, YB-1 may act either as a transcriptional activator or repressor, even of the same gene (13Mertens P.R. Harendza S. Pollock A.S. Lovett D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22905-22912Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Close inspection of the DPA gene sequences –45/–17 revealed the presence of an inverted CCAAT box on the opposite strand with an inverse repeat sequence extending from –37 to –10 bps relative to the transcription start site (see Fig. 3). These motifs exhibit striking similarities to a previously identified enhancer element (denoted RE-1 and R1, respectively) in the rat and human matrix metalloproteinase-2 promoters, which is a well characterized binding site for YB-1 (14Mertens P.R. Alfonso-Jaume M.A. Steinmann K. Lovett D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32957-32965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The current study examined the potential YB-1 interaction with the inverted CCAAT-box and demonstrates that YB-1 functions as a positive trans-activator of DPA gene expression, underscoring the pivotal role of YB-1 in the regulation of cellular proliferation. Rat mesangial cells (MCs) were established and characterized as described previously (15Mertens P.R. Espenkott V. Venjakob B. Heintz B. Handt S. Sieberth H.G.

DNA Polymerase α Promoter Constructs—DNA polymerase α promoter/luciferase reporter plasmids were kindly donated by T. S.-F. Wang (8Pearson B.E. Nasheuer H.P. Wang T.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 2081-2095Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Designations pDPALΔ5(–1571) and pDPASLΔ5(–248) refer to plasmids that contain 1571 and 248 bps of the DPA upstream sequence, respectively, which is subcloned in pSV0A. PSV0ALΔ5 is a negative control plasmid also subcloned in pSV0A. DPA sequences –65/+45, –46/+45, and –9/+45 were subcloned into the multiple cloning restriction sites BglII and KpnI of reporter constructs pGL3-Basic and -Promoter (Promega). Transient transfection of MCs was performed with liposome preparation Tfx-50 (Promega) as described (19En-Nia A. Reisdorff J. Stefanidis I. Floege J. Heinrich P.C. Mertens P.R. Biochem. J. 2002; 362: 693-700Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Purified plasmid DNA was diluted in 1000 μl of RPMI 1640 medium, mixed with sterile Tfx-50 preparation (4.5 μl/μg of DNA), and incubated at room temperature for 15 min. MCs were grown to 60–70% confluency in 6-well culture plates and washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline. To each well 1 ml DNA/liposome mixture was added and incubated for 2.5 h at 37 °C with subsequent addition of complete 10% fetal calf serum/RPMI medium. In co-transfection experiments 1 μg of luciferase reporter plasmid was combined with 1 μg of pSG5-YB-1 plasmid DNA/well. The total DNA content was equalized by inclusion of pSG5 plasmid. As control for transfection efficiency, pSV40-βGal plasmid (1 μg/well; Promega), was included. Cell lysis, β-galactosidase, and luciferase assays were performed after 48 h. Luciferase assays were performed with 100 μl of the lysates as described previously (20Mertens P.R. Alfonso-Jaume M.A. Steinmann K. Lovett D.H. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1999; 10: 2480-2487Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). β-Galactosidase activity was measured using a commercial chemiluminescence assay (Promega). All transfections were performed in triplicate to quadruplicate and were repeated at least three times. Transfection results were averaged and are expressed as the mean ± 1 S.D. Cells were grown to 80% confluency in tissue culture flasks, washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline without calcium and magnesium, and scraped in 10 ml of cold phosphate-buffered saline. Nuclear and cytoplasmic cell extracts were prepared as described previously (13Mertens P.R. Harendza S. Pollock A.S. Lovett D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22905-22912Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined by the Bio-Rad protein assay using bovine serum albumin as standard. Extracts were stored at –80 °C until performance of electrophoretic mobility shift analysis, Western, or Southwestern blotting. Double-stranded probes (–65GCCGGAAGTCCGCAGCCTCCCGGAGCCGCTGATTGGCTTTCAGGCTGGCGCCTGTCTCGGCCCCC) were generated by heating complementary synthetic oligonucleotides for 10 min at 95 °C in Tris-EDTA with subsequent cooling to room temperature over 6 h. All probes were radiolabeled by means of T4-polynucleotide kinase using [γ-32P]ATP and were purified on 14% polyacrylamide gels and eluted, and 6 × 104 cpm of labeled probe was included per binding reaction. Binding reactions were performed at 22 °C for 30 min in binding buffer (20 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 20% glycerol, 0.1 m NaCl, 0.2 mm EDTA) containing 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 300 μg/ml acetylated bovine serum albumin, and 2 μg of poly(dI-dC) in a total volume of 25 μl upon the addition of nuclear or cytoplasmic extracts. Samples were electrophoresed on non-denaturing 4% polyacrylamide, 7.5% glycerol gels in a buffer containing 1× Tris borate/EDTA followed by autoradiography. Recombinant YB-1 was prepared from a pRSET vector (Invitrogen) containing an insert coding for a hexahistidine T7 epitope-YB-1 fusion protein as described by Mertens et al. (14Mertens P.R. Alfonso-Jaume M.A. Steinmann K. Lovett D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32957-32965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). For competition experiments, unlabeled oligonucleotides or nonspecific DNA (500-fold molar excess) were added to the binding reaction 15 min before the addition of labeled oligonucleotides followed by a 30-min incubation period and subsequent separation on polyacrylamide gels. Relative binding affinities were determined by quantitation of shifted bands using a PhosphorImager system (Bio-Rad). For supershift assays, affinity-purified rabbit anti-YB-1 antibody raised against a C-terminal epitope (20Mertens P.R. Alfonso-Jaume M.A. Steinmann K. Lovett D.H. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1999; 10: 2480-2487Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was added to the nuclear extracts 12 h before the addition of labeled oligonucleotides, and the binding reaction was incubated for 30 min at 20 °C. Nuclear proteins (5 μg) were separated by SDS-10% PAGE before transfer to nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher and Schuell) and blocked in TTBS (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20) containing 2% BSA for 2 h at room temperature. Filters were incubated with primary polyclonal rabbit anti-YB-1 antibody (1:1000) followed by 3 washes with TTBS for 5 min each and incubation with secondary goat anti-rabbit IgG in TTBS. For DNA polymerase α protein detection, a polyclonal antibody raised in goat (N19, Santa Cruz) was used at 1:1000 dilution with bovine anti-goat IgG (Santa Cruz; 1:5000) serving as secondary antibody. The filters were washed 3 times with TTBS and developed with an ECL detection kit (Amersham Biosciences). Southwestern blot analysis was performed as described (13Mertens P.R. Harendza S. Pollock A.S. Lovett D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22905-22912Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) using MC nuclear proteins (50 μg) and radiolabeled DPA RE-1 oligonucleotide probes (106 cpm/ml). Confluent human kidney cells (HK-2) were grown to 80% confluence and serum-starved for 24 h. Subsequently cells were incubated with 10% fetal bovine serum for 3 and 6 h and subjected to chromatin immunoprecipitation, as described by the manufacturer of the chromatin immunoprecipitation assay kit (Upstate Biotechnology Inc.). Briefly, 106 cells were treated with 1% formaldehyde solution for 10 min at 37 °C to cross-link proteins and were resuspended in lysis buffer containing 1% SDS, 10 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.1). Extracts were sonicated until sheared DNA had an average size of 1 kilobase. DNA-protein complexes were used for immunoprecipitation reactions that included polyclonal anti-YB-1 antibodies (20Mertens P.R. Alfonso-Jaume M.A. Steinmann K. Lovett D.H. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1999; 10: 2480-2487Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Control reactions were set up without antibody and with a salmon sperm DNA/protein A-agarose slurry (Upstate Biotechnology). Protein-DNA cross-links were reversed by adding 5 m NaCl and heating to 65 °C for 4 h. DNA was recovered and used for PCR reactions with primers that amplify the DNA polymerase α proximal promoter (forward, 5′-CGC CCA AAT CTT TTC CCA TC-3′; reverse, 5′-CA CGG CGA CGA CTG TGA GAT-3′). Conditions of PCR were as follows: 1 cycle of 95 °C for 5 min followed by 40 cycles of 95 °C for 30 s, 51 °C for 30 s and 72 °C for 30 s. Mung bean nuclease treatment was performed as described by Norman et al. (17Norman J.T. Lindahl G.E. Shakib K. En-Nia A. Yilmaz E. Mertens P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29880-29890Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The strictly double-stranded, asymmetrically end-labeled probe was prepared by digesting pT4-Luc-DPA RE-1 with BglII or KpnI; the resultant overhanging 5′ ends were dephosphorylated with calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase (Roche Applied Science) and end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP by means of T4 polynucleotide kinase (Roche Applied Science). The DNA fragment was released by BglII/KpnI digestion and gel-purified. About 105 cpm of probe was incubated in the presence of 1 μg of poly(dI-dC) with either rYB-1 (10 ng) or nuclear proteins (10 μg) in binding buffer A (without EDTA, supplemented with 4 mm MgCl2) in a total volume of 15 μl at 25 °C for 20 min. The reaction volume was diluted 5-fold, and 1 volume of mung bean nuclease buffer was added. Mung bean nuclease reactions were performed at saturating concentrations of enzyme, as previously determined by titration. 50 units of mung bean nuclease (100 units/μl; Promega) were added to each reaction and incubated for 20 min at 37 °C, followed by termination with 240 μl of stop buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 100 mm NaCl, 20 mm EDTA, 0.1% SDS, 100 μg/ml proteinase K). After incubation in stop buffer at 37 °C for 15 min, reactions were phenol/chloroformextracted once and precipitated. Samples were subjected to electrophoresis on 12.5% polyacrylamide urea gels with parallel lanes containing chemical sequencing reactions. Cycling MCs grown in complete medium with 10% fetal calf serum were incubated with phosphothiorated antisense (AS) or scrambled control oligonucleotides (Stanford University), as described previously by Duh et al. (21Duh J.L. Zhu H. Shertzer H.G. Nebert D.W. Puga A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30499-30507Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) at concentrations ranging from 10 to 50 μm. Medium containing oligonucleotides was replaced every 24 h. Direct cell counting was performed with trypan blue staining for assessment of viable cells. Three independent experiments were performed in quadruplicate. Results were averaged and are expressed as the mean ± 1 S.D. MCs were grown to 50% confluency on 10-cm plates in RPMI 1640 with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 100 units/ml penicillin. Cells were transfected with the empty vector pSuperDuper (Oligo-Engine, Seattle, WA) or the pSuperDuper vector harboring the sequence 5′-GGTCATCGCAACGAAGGTTTT-3′ as a tail to tail tandem repeat of bp 285–305 of the human YB-1-coding sequence (accession number J03827). Stable transfections with liposomal preparation FuGENE were performed in conjunction with G418 resistance plasmid pUHD15–1neo (BD-Clontech, Heidelberg, Germany). Five μg total plasmid DNA and 15 μl of FuGENE solution were mixed in 500 μl of serum-free medium, incubated for 15 min at room temperature, and added dropwise to culture medium (10 ml/plate). After 24 h the medium was exchanged, and selection with G418 at a concentration of 400 μg/ml was started. Within 2 weeks single cell clones were apparent and selectively picked. Screening for the presence of pSuperDuper plasmid DNA was performed, and changes of YB-1 mRNA and protein levels were performed by real-time PCR and immunoblotting using a polyclonal anti-YB-1 antibody. Proliferation of YB-1 knock down and control cells was measured by BrdUrd incorporation using the BrdUrd colorimetric enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit (Roche Applied Science). Cells were plated on 96-well plates for 24 h. During the last 16 h the cells were grown in the presence of BrdUrd, and the incorporation thereof was measured by ELISA using an anti-BrdUrd-peroxidase monoclonal antibody. Statistical significance was determined for paired comparisons using Student's t test or by analysis of variance for multiple comparisons where appropriate. Reduction of Endogenous YB-1 Inhibits Cell Proliferation—We have hypothesized of a key role for YB-1 in cell proliferation in non-transformed cells. As a first step, an oligonucleotide antisense approach was chosen to reduce endogenous YB-1 concentrations in rat MCs. The efficacy of YB-1 transcript reduction was assessed at the protein level by Western blotting (Fig. 1A). An approximate 60% reduction of YB-1 protein was detected in the antisense-treated cells, whereas there was no change of the YB-1 protein concentration in cells incubated with scrambled control oligonucleotides. Direct cell counting revealed a concentration-dependent inhibitory effect of the YB-1 antisense oligonucleotide on cell proliferation of up to 50%, whereas proliferation was unaffected by control oligonucleotide (Fig. 1B). Because sequence-independent effects have been described for phosphothiorated antisense oligonucleotides, a second approach utilizing interfering double-stranded RNA was performed. Here, a 80% reduction of endogenous YB-1 mRNA and protein levels was achieved in MC and led to a 90% inhibition of endogenous YB-1 protein levels (Fig. 1C, left and middle panel). Under these conditions cell proliferation, assessed by BrdUrd incorporation, was reduced by ∼50% (Fig. 1C, right panel). YB-1 Stimulates DNA Polymerase α Promoter Activity— Given the influence of YB-1 on the expression of other proliferation-associated genes, we next tested whether YB-1 also influences transcription of the DPA gene. A reporter assay was established using hybrid luciferase constructs harboring the 5′ regulatory sequence of the human DPA gene transfected into mesangial cells. Transfections were performed with reporter constructs pDPALΔ5 (–1571/+45) and pDPASLΔ5 (–248/+45). After co-transfection with YB-1 expression vector, pSG5-YB-1, a 2-fold increase in luciferase activity was observed with both constructs, pDPALΔ5 and pDPASLΔ5 (Fig. 2A), whereas cotransfection of pSG-5-YB-1 did not affect the activity of control luciferase vector pSV0ALΔ5. There was a 2-fold higher transcriptional activity of construct pDPALΔ5 compared with pDPASLΔ5, indicating additional elements within the extended promoter sequence. The increase of reporter gene activity with overexpressed YB-1 was concentration-dependent, as shown for construct pDPASLΔ5 in Fig. 2B. Identification of Putative YB-1 Binding Sites in the Human DNA Polymerase α Gene Promoter—Inspection of the DPA promoter sequence revealed a putative YB-1 binding site at –45/–17 bps. This sequence harbors an inverted CCAAT-box (ATTGG) and is homologous to previously described incomplete Y-box elements (22Wolffe A.P. BioEssays. 1994; 16: 245-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). Furthermore, there is a 3′ inverse repeat motif located between –27 and –11 that may constitute a template for extended YB-1/DNA binding. A comparison of the DPA Y-box element with the YB-1 binding element in the rat MMP-2 gene, designated response element-1 (MMP-2 RE-1), is shown in Fig. 3A. There is an extensive degree of similarity between both elements with seven consecutive matching bases within the Y-box, and in addition, the 3′ sequence of the Y-box contains an inverted repeat motif with 6 of 10 bases matching in both elements. To determine whether the DPA sequence, designated DPA response element 1 (DPA RE-1), also bound YB-1, Southwestern blotting and EMSA were performed. DPA RE-1 Binding Activities—The molecular masses of potential DPA RE-1-binding proteins were assessed by Southwestern blotting with nuclear proteins from MC and single-stranded as well as double-stranded probes. Single-stranded sense (SS1) oligonucleotides bound to several proteins with estimated molecular masses of 26, 32, and 52 kDa (Fig. 3B). Specificity of the binding reaction was confirmed by inclusion of homologous (lane 2) and heterologous (lane 3) competitor DNA at 1000-fold molar excess. The 52-kDa band exhibited the same mobility as endogenous YB-1 protein that is detected by Western blotting using an anti-YB-1 antibody (lane 4), supporting the notion of YB-1 binding to this element. A similar banding pattern was observed with the antisense DNA strand (data not shown). Recombinant YB-1 Binds to the DPA RE-1—DNA binding studies were performed with recombinant YB-1 protein (rYB-1) and sense (SS1), antisense (SS2), and double (DS)-stranded DPA RE-1 probes. Two closely migrating complexes were detected by electrophoretic mobility shift analysis with all probes (Fig. 4A, lanes 2, 6, and 10). Quantitative densitometry of bands revealed a 5-fold higher affinity of rYB-1 for both single-stranded templates compared with the double-stranded probe. Specificity of binding reactions was confirmed by inclusion of homologous competitor DNA at 500-fold molar excess, leading to diminished bands (lanes 3, 7, and 11), whereas heterologous competitor DNA had only a minor effect on complex formation (lanes 4, 8, and 12). Endogenous YB-1 Binds to the DPA RE-1—Similar DNA binding studies were performed with MC nuclear proteins. Nuclear proteins formed several distinct complexes with SS1, SS2, and DS probes (Fig. 4B). To test for YB-1 participation in these complexes, supershift studies were performed using a specific anti-YB-1 antibody directed against epitopes in the protein C terminus (20Mertens P.R. Alfonso-Jaume M.A. Steinmann K. Lovett D.H. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1999; 10: 2480-2487Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This domain is known to participate in protein-protein interactions and also determines DNA binding specificity. With inclusion of the anti-YB-1 antibody, supershifts were apparent with the DS (lane 3) and SS2 probes (lane 9, indicated by an asterisk). At the same time complexes 10> and 11> appeared diminished. For the sense strand, a disruption of complex 5> was detected (indicated by <#), and at the same time a novel high mobility complex appeared (lane 6, indicated by “**”). Here, the antibody most likely prevented binding of YB-1 to the probe and no supershift appeared. These experiments indicate that endogenous YB-1 is a component of the nucleoprotein complexes formed with DPA RE-1 in all conformations tested and that it interacts with other DPA RE-1 binding factors. Serum-dependent Changes of Complex Formation at the DPA RE-1—Because the sequence element –45/–17 of DPA is responsive to serum growth factor, DNA binding studies were performed with nuclear (NE) and cytoplasmic (CE) extracts from serum-starved and serum-stimulated MCs. MCs were serum-starved for 24 h and subsequently incubated for different periods with 10% bovine fetal serum before extracts were prepared. Formation of nucleocomplexes was tested with radiolabeled double (DS) and sense-strand (SS1) DPA RE-1 probes (Fig. 5A and B). Under these conditions three distinct bands were detected with DS DPA RE-1 that exhibited only minor changes in intensities after serum stimulation (Fig. 5A). Again, inclusion of anti-YB-1 antibody led to the formation of a supershift (indicated by an asterisk in lanes 5 and 10) and diminished bands 2> and 3> (Fig. 5A). With cytoplasmic and double strand probe a minor decrease of complex >6 was detected after 2 h of serum stimulation. In contrast to these minor changes with the DS probe, major changes in complex formation were detected with the sense strand of DPA RE-1. The intensities of bands designated 1>, 2>, 4>, and 5> (Fig. 5B, compare lanes 1–4) were increased within 30 min of serum incubation. This increase was transient and lasted for less than 2 h. Reciprocal changes were observed with cytoplasmic extracts; that is, band intensities indicated by 8> (Fig. 5B, compare lanes 6–9) decreased within 30 min and increased again 24 h after serum stimulation. Involvement of YB-1 in complex formation was demonstrated by inclusion of polyclonal anti-YB-1 antibody (Fig. 5B, lanes 5 and 10). Here diminished bands (indicated by #) and supershifts (indicated by *) were present. These finding are in accord with a transient serum growth factor-induced shift of cytoplasmic YB-1 protein to the nuclear compartment and predominant binding of YB-1-containing complexes to the single-stranded DPA RE-1 element.

This turnover is heme-dependent, and rapid degradation involves heme binding to a heme regulatory motif (HRM) of Irr. Here, we show that Irr confers iron-dependent instability on glutathione S-transferase (GST) when fused to it. Analysis of Irr-GST derivatives with C-terminal truncations of Irr implicated a second region necessary for degradation, other than the HRM, and showed that the HRM was not sufficient to confer instability on GST. The HRM-defective mutant IrrC29A degraded in the presence of iron but much more slowly than the wild-type protein. This slow turnover was heme-dependent, as discerned by the stability of Irr in a heme-defective mutant strain. Whereas the HRM of purified recombinant Irr binds ferric (oxidized) heme, a second site that binds ferrous (reduced) heme was identified based on spectral analysis of truncation and substitution mutants. A mutant in which histidines 117–119 were changed to alanines severely diminished ferrous, but not ferric, heme binding. Introduction of these substitutions in an Irr-GST fusion stabilized the protein in vivo in the presence of iron. We conclude that normal iron-dependent Irr degradation involves two heme binding sites and that both redox states of heme are required for rapid turnover.

Accordingly, Irr persists in heme synthesis mutant strains in the presence of iron, and a mutation in an Irr heme binding site stabilizes the protein in the presence of the metal (13Qi Z. Hamza I. O'Brian M.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13056-13061Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Thus, heme is an effector molecule in Irr degradation that reflects the availability of iron for heme synthesis. Irr interacts directly with the heme biosynthesis enzyme ferrochelatase (17Qi Z. O'Brian M.R. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 155-162Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Moreover, a regulatory activity for ferrochelatase was identified, distinct from its catalytic function, which allows Irr function to be controlled by the substrates of ferrochelatase. In the presence of iron, ferrochelatase inactivates Irr followed by heme-dependent degradation. Under iron limitation, protoporphyrin relieves the inhibition of Irr by ferrochelatase, probably by promoting protein dissociation, allowing genetic repression. Thus, Irr responds to iron via the status of protoporphyrin and heme locally at the site of heme synthesis. This allows heme to regulate a cellular process in the absence of a free heme pool (17Qi Z. O'Brian M.R. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 155-162Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Heme binds directly to Irr near the N terminus at a region termed the heme regulatory motif (HRM), which is necessary for rapid degradation (13Qi Z. Hamza I. O'Brian M.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13056-13061Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). HRMs are found in functionally diverse proteins, and Cys-Pro is the only absolutely conserved sequence within the short motif. Numerous heme-mediated functions of proteins require an HRM, including mitochondrial targeting of mammalian δ-aminolevulinic acid synthase precursor (10Lathrop J.T. Timko M.P. Science. 1993; 259: 522-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar), transcriptional activation of yeast HAP1 (18Lee H.C. Hon T. Lan C. Zhang L. Mol. Cell.

In the present study, we further addressed the mechanism of iron-dependent degradation of Irr. We provide evidence for a second heme binding site that is necessary for degradation. The HRM and the new heme site bind the ferric and ferrous forms of heme, respectively, showing that normal Irr degradation involves both redox states of heme. Strains and Media—B. japonicum I110 and LO were parent strains used in the present work. Strain MLG1 is a hemA disruption strain (23Guerinot M.L. Chelm B.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 1837-1841Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Strain IrrC29A contains an irr allele that encodes an Irr protein with a Cys29→Ala mutation (13Qi Z. Hamza I. O'Brian M.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13056-13061Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Strains I110(pGST), I110(pIrr-GST), I110(pC29A-GST), and I110(pH117/118/119A-GST) contain plasmids that express GST fusion proteins of wild-type or mutant Irr proteins. Strains I110(pIrr1–150-GST), I110(pIrr1–135-GST), I110(pIrr1–116-GST), and I110(pIrr1–36-GST) contain plasmids that express GST fusion proteins of Irr C-terminal truncation. B. japonicum strains were routinely grown at 29 °C in GSY medium (35Frustaci J.M. Sangwan I. O'Brian M.R. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 1145-1150Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with appropriate antibiotics. Strain MLG1 was grown with 50 μg/ml kanamycin. Strain IrrC29A was grown with 50 μg/ml tetracycline and 50 μg/ml streptomycin. Strains that contain plasmids were grown with 50 μg/ml tetracycline. For low iron medium, modified GSY medium was used, which contains 0.5g/liter yeast extract instead of 1g/liter and no exogenous iron source. The actual iron concentration of the medium was 0.3 μm, as determined with a PerkinElmer Model 1100B atomic absorption spectrometer. The high iron medium was supplemented with 6 μm FeCl3 and 15 μm hemin for heme-containing medium. Escherichia coli strain DH5α was used for propagation of plasmids in LB medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin. Mutagenesis of the irr Gene—The irr gene was amplified by PCR from pUCΔSES7, which contains the irr gene within pUC19, with HindIII and EcoRV sites at 5′ and 3′ ends, respectively. The product was ligated into HindIII/EcoRV sites of pSK to construct pSK/irr. Mutant irr genes with His→Ala mutations were amplified from pSK/irr using QuikChange (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), using two complementary primers containing the nucleotide changes. Nucleotide sequences of mutant irr genes were confirmed by sequencing. The mutations changed the histidine codon (CAA) to an alanine codon (GCC) used highly in B. japonicum. Thus, single mutants (H117A, H118A, and H119A), double mutants (H117A/H118A, H117A/H119A, and H118A/H119A), and the triple mutant (H117A/H118A/H119A) were constructed in pSK with HindIII and EcoRV sites at 5′ and 3′ ends, respectively. Construction of GST Fusion Proteins—The irr-GST gene fusion contains a GST coding region at the C terminus and irr gene, including a 211-bp promoter region and a 492-bp coding region at the N terminus. To do this, the coding region of GST was amplified by PCR from pGEX-6P-2 (Amersham Biosciences) with EcoRV and PstI sites at 5′ and 3′ ends, respectively. The product was ligated into EcoRV/PstI sites of pSK to construct pSK/GST. The nucleotide sequence of GST was confirmed by sequencing. To construct GST gene fusions, the EcoRV/PstI fragment from pSK/GST was ligated into the EcoRV/PstI sites of pSK constructs of irr genes, yielding pSK/Irr-GST, pSK/C29A-GST, and pSK/H117A-H118A-H119A-GST. GST fusions of C-terminal truncations of the irr gene were amplified from pSK/Irr-GST by QuikChange using two complementary primers that encompass the deleted region, yielding pSK/Irr1–36-GST, pSK/Irr1–116-GST, pSK/Irr1–135-GST, pSK/Irr1–150-GST, and the control pSK/Pirr-GST. The primers were complementary to both sides of the deleted region. Nucleotide sequences of C-terminal truncations and the GST control were confirmed by sequencing. Truncations encode proteins that retain the N-terminal 36, 116, 135, and 150 residues of Irr, respectively. Plasmids pGST, pIrr-GST, pC29A-GST, pH117/118/119A-GST, pIrr1–36-GST, pIrr1–116-GST, pIrr1–135-GST, and pIrr1–150-GST were constructed by ligating HindIII/PstI fragments from their pSK constructs into the broad host range vector pLAFR3. Plasmids were then introduced into B. japonicum I110 by conjugation, as described previously (24Chauhan S. O'Brian M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19823-19827Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), yielding strains I110(pGST), I110(pIrr-GST), I110(pC29A-GST), I110(pH117/118/119A-GST), I110(pIrr1–36-GST), I110(pIrr1–116-GST), I110(pIrr1–135-GST), and I110(pIrr1–150-GST), respectively. Analysis of Irr-GST Fusion Proteins—GST fusion protein levels were measured in cells grown under varying conditions of iron or heme. Aliquots of cells grown to mid-log phase were analyzed for Irr-GST protein on 12% SDS-PAGE by immunoblots using antibodies against GST (Zymed Laboratories, San Francisco, CA) or Irr (16Hamza I. Chauhan S. Hassett R. O'Brian M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21669-21674Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Detection of GroEL was carried out as a control using anti-GroEL antibodies (StressGen, Vancouver, Canada). The turnover of GST fusion proteins in cells was examined by pulse-chase followed by GST pull-down with glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads. The cells were grown to A540 of 0.5 in low iron medium to allow the Irr-GST derivatives to accumulate in the cells. The cultures (50 ml) then were centrifuged, washed, and resuspended in 50 ml of defined medium lacking cysteine and methionine and were incubated at 29 °C for 1 h. The defined medium was as follows (per liter of media): 670 mg of yeast nitrogen base, 243 mg of amino acid dropout powder, 0.2 mg of riboflavin, 0.08 mg of p-aminobenzoic acid, 0.5 mg of nicotinic acid, 0.12 mg of biotin, 0.8 mg of thiamin·HCl, 0.8 mg of calcium pantothenate, 0.48 mg of inositol, 300 mg of KH2PO4, 300 mg of Na2HPO4, 100 mg of MgSO4·7H2O, 50 mg of CaCl2·2H2O, 10 mg of H3BO3, 1 mg of ZnSO4·2H2O, 0.5 mg of CuSO4·5H2O, 0.5 mg of MnCl2·4H2O, 0.5 mg of Na2MoO4·2H2O, and 4 g of glycerol (pH6.8). The cells were then radiolabeled by adding 20 μCi/ml trans35S-labeled l-[35S]methionine and l-[35S]cysteine (MP Biomedicals) and were incubated at 29 °C for 2.5 h. The cells were then centrifuged, washed, and resuspended in 40 ml of modified GSY. At time 0 of the chase, 12 μm FeCl3 was added to the cultures, and the cells were then incubated at 29 °C. 20-ml aliquots were removed at 0 and 4 h and washed with phosphate-buffered saline. The cell pellets were resuspended in 10 cell volumes of lysis buffer (50 mm glucose, 10 mm EDTA, 25 mm Tris, pH 8, 4 mg/ml lysozyme, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) followed by incubation at room temperature for 10 min. The lysed cells were mixed with 1 ml of radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mg/ml SDS, 5 mg/ml deoxycholate, 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40) containing 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and were incubated on ice for 30 min with occasional mixing. The suspension was centrifuged, and the supernatant was used for GST pull-down. The lysate (1 ml) was incubated with 10 μl of glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads at 4 °C for 30 min. The beads were washed four times with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer and then resuspended in 25 μl of SDS sample buffer. 15-μl samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography using x-ray film or a Bio-Rad phosphorimaging device. Analysis of Irr in Vivo—Irr levels were measured in cells grown under varying conditions of iron or heme. Aliquots of I110, IrrC29A, or MLG1 cells grown to mid-log phase were analyzed on 12% SDS-PAGE by immunoblots using antibodies against Irr (16Hamza I. Chauhan S. Hassett R. O'Brian M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21669-21674Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Overexpression and Purification of Recombinant Irr Proteins—The IMPACT I system (New England Biolabs) was used for synthesis of recombinant Irr proteins. The coding regions of wild-type and mutant Irr proteins were amplified by PCR from their pSK constructs with NdeI and SapI sites at 5′ and 3′ ends, respectively, and ligated into NdeI/SapI sites of pCYB1. C-terminal truncations were amplified by PCR from pSK/irr using the 5′ end of the coding region as the forward primer and the corresponding C-terminal region as the reverse primer with NdeI and SapI sites at 5′ and 3′ ends, respectively, and ligated into NdeI/SapI sites of pCYB1. The constructs in pCYB1 were confirmed by nucleotide sequencing. Protein overexpression and purification were carried as described previously (13Qi Z. Hamza I. O'Brian M.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13056-13061Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Heme Binding Experiments—The effects of wild-type, mutant, and truncated Irr proteins on the absorption spectrum properties of ferric heme were determined by recording the absorption spectra of 4 μm hemin in the presence or absence of 8 μm protein. To determine ferrous heme binding properties, 30 mm dithionite was added to reduce ferric heme (hemin) to ferrous heme. The spectra were recorded between 320 and 450 nm on a DW-2000 UV-VIS spectrophotometer (SLM Instruments, Inc.). Interaction between Ferrochelatase and Irr—GST and GST-FC were overexpressed and purified using pGEX-6P-2 vector, as described previously (17Qi Z. O'Brian M.R. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 155-162Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads containing 2.5 μg of GST or 5 μg of GST-FC were incubated with 10 μg of purified recombinant Irr proteins for 1 h at 4 °C. The beads were then washed four times with phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% Triton X-100 and boiled in SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Irr proteins were detected by immunoblots of 12% SDS-PAGE gel using antibodies against Irr. Equal amounts of GST or GST-FC were confirmed by Ponceau S staining of the immunoblots. Identification of a Region of Irr That Confers Regulated Instability on the Protein—GST expressed in B. japonicum from a plasmid is unaffected by the iron status of the cells as determined by immunoblots using anti-GST antibodies (Fig. 1A). However, the protein level of an Irr-GST fusion expressed from the same promoter as GST was iron-dependent, with very little detected in cells grown in iron-containing medium. This is similar to what was observed for authentic Irr (13Qi Z. Hamza I. O'Brian M.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13056-13061Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) (see “An HRM Mutant of Irr Degrades Slowly in a Heme-dependent Manner”). Anti-GST antibodies were used to follow the fusion proteins in the experiments shown, but similar results were obtained using antibodies directed against Irr (data not shown). GroEL is not regulated by iron and was used as a control (Fig. 1A). To assess whether the dependence of Irr-GST on iron was due to protein turnover, cells were pulse-labeled with [35S]methionine and [35S]cysteine in low iron medium, and the fate of Irr-GST was followed during the chase by precipitation with glutathione-Sepharose beads at 0 and 4 h after the addition of 12 μm FeCl3 (Fig. 1B). Although GST was detected on autoradiograms after 4 h of exposure to iron, the Irr-GST fusion turned over in an iron-responsive manner. These results are qualitatively similar to what is observed for authentic Irr (13Qi Z. Hamza I. O'Brian M.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13056-13061Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). These findings show that the conditional instability of Irr can be conferred on a stable protein when fused to it. Furthermore, these fusions can be used to identify regions of Irr necessary for degradation. Irr(1–36)-GST contains the N-terminal amino acids of Irr, including the HRM, fused to GST. Unlike the full-length fusion, Irr(1–36)-GST was stable in the presence of iron (Fig. 1), suggesting that the HRM is not sufficient to confer iron-dependent instability on GST. Additional fusions containing truncations from the C-terminal end of Irr were constructed (Fig. 1). Irr(1–150)-GST and Irr(1–135)-GST accumulated to very low levels when grown in iron-containing media and turned over in response to iron in pulse-chase experiments (Fig. 1). However, Irr(1–116)-GST was unresponsive to iron in the growth and turnover experiments, indicating that a region of Irr between residues 116 and 135 is critical for iron responsiveness. Endogenous Irr disappeared in response to iron and heme in all cases (data not shown). Irr interacts with ferrochelatase, the enzyme that catalyzes the final step of heme biosynthesis, and ferrochelatase is required for normal iron-dependent turnover of Irr (17Qi Z. O'Brian M.R. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 155-162Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). This requirement can be overridden by supplementation of the growth medium with heme. Irr-GST and the truncations that were iron-responsive also degraded in response to heme (Fig. 1A). However, Irr-(1–116) was stable in the presence of heme as well as iron. These observations indicate that the stability of Irr-(1–116) was not because of an inability to interact with ferrochelatase, but rather the truncation is missing a heme-dependent instability element. We attempted to make N-terminal truncation fusions, but none of these constructs were expressed in B. japonicum, orin E. coli. We have no explanation for those observations. An HRM Mutant of Irr Degrades Slowly in a Heme-dependent Manner—Iron-dependent degradation of Irr is mediated by heme, which binds directly to the HRM (13Qi Z. Hamza I. O'Brian M.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13056-13061Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Irr accumulates under low iron conditions but disappears within 60–90 min upon exposure of cells to iron (Fig. 2A) (13Qi Z. Hamza I. O'Brian M.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13056-13061Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). By contrast, IrrC29A, which contains a Cys29→Ala substitution within the HRM, does not degrade within this time frame in response to iron (Fig. 2A) (13Qi Z. Hamza I. O'Brian M.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13056-13061Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, we observed that when strain IrrC29A cells were grown from an inoculum in medium containing FeCl3, the mutant Irr protein was expressed at very low levels, as discerned in immunoblots, similar to that observed in the wild type (Fig. 2B). Thus, it appeared that iron negatively affected Irr levels even in the HRM mutant. Because the cells were exposed to iron for a longer period of time in the growth experiments compared with the initial time course experiments, we repeated the latter over a longer time period (Fig. 2C). One hour after exposure of the cells to iron, wild-type Irr was almost undetectable in immunoblots, whereas IrrC29A was easily discerned. However, IrrC29A levels were diminished substantially at 3 h and almost undetectable by 4 h. Thus, Irr responds to iron independently of the HRM, although more slowly. This observation agrees with the conclusion that Irr degradation involves elements in addition to the HRM. To determine whether the slow disappearance is heme-dependent, we monitored the responsiveness of Irr to iron in a heme-deficient background. The hemA mutant strain MLG1 is deficient in δ-aminolevulinic acid synthase, the enzyme that catalyzes the first step in heme biosynthesis. Irr was completely stable in the hemA strain throughout the 4-h time course (Fig. 2C) and in the cultures of the mutant grown in the presence of iron (Fig. 2B), suggesting that heme is needed for iron-responsiveness of both the wild-type and mutant Irr proteins. In addition, Irr was nearly undetectable in cultures of the wild-type, IrrC29A, or the hemA strain when media were supplemented with heme (Fig. 2B). The data indicate that normal, rapid iron-dependent degradation of Irr requires the HRM but that degradation can occur slowly without the HRM in a heme-dependent manner. Irr Binds Ferrous Heme Independent of the HRM—Heme-dependent degradation of Irr in the absence of a functional HRM raises the possibility that Irr has another heme binding site involved in turnover. Heme can exist in the ferrous (heme iron is Fe2+) or ferric (Fe3+) forms. We showed previously that purified recombinant Irr has two ferric heme binding sites with different affinities (13Qi Z. Hamza I. O'Brian M.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13056-13061Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). One of them is the HRM, which is responsible for a 377-nm peak in the absorption spectrum of heme in the presence of Irr that is absent in the IrrC29A mutant protein (13Qi Z. Hamza I. O'Brian M.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13056-13061Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3A). A second ferric heme binding site was discerned from binding studies (17Qi Z. O'Brian M.R. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 155-162Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) and from an absorption shoulder at 419 nm in wild-type Irr and a peak at 413 nm in IrrC29A (Fig. 3A) (13Qi Z. Hamza I. O'Brian M.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13056-13061Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). This second ferric heme site remains uncharacterized and, as described below, is distinct from the newly described heme binding site. Here, the effects of Irr on the absorption spectrum of reduced (ferrous) heme were examined. A peak at 423 nm was observed in the presence of Irr, whereas free heme had only a very slight, broad feature in that region (Fig. 3B). Unlike ferric heme, the spectrum of ferrous heme bound to IrrC29A was identical to the wild-type protein, showing that Cys29 within the HRM was not a ligand for reduced heme. Thus, Irr binds ferrous heme independently of the HRM. Effects of Irr Truncations on Ferrous and Ferric Heme Binding—It seemed plausible that a heme binding site on Irr other than the HRM participates in turnover and that one or more residues necessary for heme binding was absent in the truncations. To address this, we analyzed the effects of truncations of purified recombinant Irr derivatives on the spectral properties of heme (Fig. 4). The 419-nm shoulder of ferric heme bound to Irr was lost in Irr-(1–80), and the 377-nm peak was shifted slightly to 380 nm, indicating that this truncation retained the HRM but lost the other ferric heme binding site (Fig. 4A). The ferric heme spectra of Irr-(1–116) was similar to the wild type, with spectral features at 377 and 419 nm. However, the 423-nm peak of the ferrous heme spectrum of wild-type Irr was lost in Irr-(1–116), as well as in Irr-(1–80) (Fig. 4B), showing that this truncated protein retained the ability to bind ferric heme but not ferrous heme. These data show that one or more ligands binding ferrous heme must be different from those binding either of the ferric heme binding sites. In addition, the loss of ferrous heme binding in Irr-(1–116) in vitro correlates with the loss of iron- and heme-dependent degradation of the Irr-(1–116) fusion protein in vivo. Ferrous Heme Binds an Irr Histidine and Is Required for Degradation—Histidine residues are often involved in heme binding (25Dawson J.H. Andersson L.A. Sono M. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 3606-3617Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As an initial search for candidate histidine residues in Irr, we aligned numerous Irr homologs from different organisms using ClustalW (26Pearson W.R. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 183: 63-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (1652) Google Scholar). Histidines are completely conserved at positions 63, 117, and 119 (B. japonicum numbering) and His118 is conserved in many, but not all, of the Irr homologs. We mutagenized each of the three conserved histidines, as well as His118, to alanine and analyzed the spectra of ferrous heme bound to each of the four mutants. None of the single mutations abrogated the 423-nm peak (data not shown). It is possible that mutation of a heme binding ligand can be compensated by another residue (e.g. Ref. 27Letoffe S. Deniau C. Wolff N. Dassa E. Delepelaire P. Lecroisey A. Wandersman C. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 41: 439-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), which seems particularly plausible with the three adjacent histidines. Therefore, we studied that region further by constructing and analyzing the three double mutations and the triple mutation H117A/H118A/H119A. All of the double mutations retained the ferrous heme peak, but it was slightly diminished (data not shown). However the 423-nm peak was severely diminished in the triple mutant (Fig. 5A), indicating that this region is involved in ferrous heme binding. Unlike ferrous heme, ferric heme binding was retained in the triple mutant as discerned by the spectral features that were very similar to the wild type (Fig. 5B). These data reinforce the conclusion that ferrous heme binds to different residues on Irr than does ferric heme. We addressed the effects of the H117A/H118A/H119A mutant on iron responsiveness in vivo using fusion proteins (Fig. 6). Unlike the wild-type or IrrC29A fusions, the triple mutant was stable in cells grown in high iron medium (Fig. 6A). Furthermore, the triple mutant did not turnover in response to iron in pulse-chase experiments (Fig. 6B). Two lines of evidence suggest that the stability of the H117A/H118A/H119A fusion is not caused by the lost ability to interact with ferrochelatase. First, supplementation of the media with heme overrides the need for ferrochelatase for turnover, and the triple mutant was stable in heme-containing cultures (Fig. 6A). In addition, we addressed the interaction between Irr and ferrochelatase by examining the ability of a GST-ferrochelatase fusion to pull down purified recombinant Irr proteins (Fig. 7). Wild-type Irr and both the C29A and H117A/H118A/H119A mutants were precipitated by GST-ferrochelatase, thus ruling out a disruption of the mutant Irr with ferrochelatase as an explanation for its stability. The data show that ferrous heme binds Irr in the histidine 117–119 region, and this region is necessary for iron-dependent degradation.Fig. 7Interaction of Irr and mutant derivatives with GST-Ferrochelatase. The GST-FC fusion protein was used to precipitate purified recombinant Irr and mutant derivatives in solution. GST was used as a negative control. 2.5 μg of GST, 5 μg of GST-FC, and 10 μgof Irr, C29A, and H117A/H118A/H119A were used for the corresponding individual experiment. Irr proteins were detected by immunoblots using antibodies against Irr.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) We showed previously that heme binds to a HRM of Irr, which is necessary for normal degradation. In the present study, we found that a mutant Irr protein defective in the HRM degrades in response to iron, although much more slowly than the wild-type protein, and that this turnover is heme-dependent. Moreover, Irr binds ferrous heme at a site different from the HRM or from the other uncharacterized ferric heme binding site. Irr mutants with deletions or amino acid substitutions that mitigate ferrous heme binding are stable in vivo independent of iron. These findings indicate that both ferrous and ferric heme are necessary for Irr degradation and that different ligands bind the two forms of heme. Irr decay follows first order kinetics (13Qi Z. Hamza I. O'Brian M.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13056-13061Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), indicating a single mechanism for degradation. This suggests that the two hemes participate in a single degradation process rather than independent processes that occur at different rates. This is supported by the observation that mutation of the histidine(s) involved in ferrous heme binding abrogates degradation completely, even with an intact HRM (Fig. 6). The need for heme in both the oxidized and reduced forms leads us to speculate that the redox activity of heme may be important for Irr turnover. One possibility is that heme catalyzes the oxidation of Irr, promoting its degradation by a protease. Heme can react with oxygen to form reactive oxygen species that oxidatively damage proteins (28Aft R.L. Mueller G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 301-305Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) Thus, Irr may be similarly damaged. The mammalian iron regulatory protein 2 (IRP2) is oxidized by iron and subsequently degraded (29Iwai K. Drake S.K. Wehr N.B. Weissman A.M. La Vaute T. Minato N. Klausner R.D. Levine R.L. Rouault T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4924-4928Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar), and evidence implicates a role for heme (30Goessling L.S. Mascotti D.P. Thach R.E. J. Biol.

Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 336-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Heme-bound IRP2 is ubiquitinated in vitro in an O2-dependent manner, but it has not been established that heme catalyzes oxidation of the protein (32Yamanaka K. Ishikawa H. Megumi Y. Tokunaga F. Kanie M. Rouault T.A. Morishima I. Minato N. Ishimori K. Iwai K. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 336-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Another possibility is that the redox activity of Irr induces a conformational change that makes Irr accessible to a protease or another factor necessary for degradation. This idea is based on the observation that the reduced and oxidized forms of heme bind different Irr residues, and redox-dependent ligand switching is accompanied by conformational changes in the transcription factor CooA from Rhodospirillum rubrum (3Lanzilotta W.N. Schuller D.J. Thorsteinsson M.V. Kerby R.L. Roberts G.P. Poulos T.L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 876-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar) and the redox sensor EcDos from E. coli (33Kurokawa H. Lee D.S. Watanabe M. Sagami I. Mikami B. Raman C.S. Shimizu T. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 20186-20193Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Additional studies are required to further characterize the basis of heme-dependent degradation of Irr. Although Irr has been studied extensively only in B. japonicum, an irr mutant in Rhizobium leguminosarum has the same fluorescent colony phenotype as the B. japonicum mutant (34Wexler M. Todd J.D. Kolade O. Bellini D. Hemmings A.M. Sawers G. Johnston A.W. Microbiology (U. K.). 2003; 149: 1357-1365Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), and the genomes around the irr homologs show a high degree of synteny. Thus, Irr likely has a similar function in other organisms. However, examination of the Irr homologs reveals that only some of them have the Cys-Pro sequence and an HRM-like domain, whereas His117 and His119 of B. japonicum Irr are completely conserved in all of the homologs. The current work suggests that the proteins lacking an HRM may degrade nevertheless. It is possible that the second, uncharacterized ferric heme binding site partially compensates for the defective HRM in IrrC29A, allowing slow degradation. By analogy, Irr homologs lacking an HRM may have a compensatory mechanism that allows turnover. Characterization of these other homologs should shed additional light on bacterial Irr function."

Activation of Jak2/STAT3, a Gi-independent signaling pathway, which plays a major role in survival signals, is known to be activated after SDF-1α binding to CXCR4 but the domains of CXCR4 involved in this signaling remain unexplored. Using human embryonic kidney HEK-293 cells stably expressing wild-type or mutated forms of CXCR4, we demonstrated that STAT3 phosphorylation requires the N-terminal part of the third intracellular loop (ICL3) and the tyrosine 157 present at the end of the second intracellular loop (ICL2) of CXCR4. In contrast, neither the conserved Tyr135 in the DRY motif at the N terminus of ICL2 nor the Tyr65 and Tyr76 in the first intracellular loop (ICL1) are involved in this activation. ICL3, which does not contain any tyrosine residues, is needed to activate Jak2. These results demonstrate that two separate domains of CXCR4 are involved in Jak2/STAT3 signaling. The N-terminal part of ICL3 is needed to activate Jak2 after SDF-1α binding to CXCR4, leading to phosphorylation of only one cytoplasmic Tyr, present at the C terminus of ICL2, which triggers STAT3 activation.

Rodriguez-Frade J.M. Manes S. Martinez A.C. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2001; 19: 397-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). Activated Jaks in turn phosphorylate the chemokine receptor on intracellular tyrosines, providing docking sites for recruitment of STAT family proteins. After STAT phosphorylation and dimerization, these proteins translocate to the nucleus and mediate transcription of several cytokine-responsive genes (21Imada K. Leonard W.J. Mol.

In the present study, we analyzed the cytoplasmic domains and the intracellular tyrosines of CXCR4 involved in Jak2/STAT3 activation after SDF-1α binding. To address this question, we used previously constructed stable HEK-293 cells that express mutated forms of CXCR4 in which each intracellular loop (ICL) was replaced by a scrambled amino acid sequence of ICL1 that does not contain serine, threonine and tyrosine, or a CXCR4 form truncated at position 308 (54Roland J.

Construction of the CXCR4 Mutants and Tagged HA CXCR4 —Point mutation mutants of CXCR4, in which tyrosines at positions 65, 76, 135, or 157 were replaced by alanine or phenylalanine, were constructed using GeneEditor in vitro site-directed mutagenesis system from Promega or QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit from Stratagene (Stratagene Europe, Amsterdam, The Netherlands) using the wild-type CXCR4 pcDNA3 Zeo expression vector as template according to the manufacturer's instructions. Each mutated clone (CXCR4.Y65F, CXCR4.Y76A, CXCR4.Y135F, and CXCR4.Y157A) was sequenced on an Applied Biosystems (Courtaboeuf, France) Model 373A automated sequencer, using Taq polymerase and dye terminator. CXCR4 and all the constructed mutants are tagged in the C-terminal part of the molecule with the FLAG epitope. A plasmid (pcDNA3 Zeo) encoding the HA tag epitope at the N terminus of wild-type CXCR4 (CXCR4.HA) was constructed by PCR and sequenced. Cell Culture and Transfection—HEK-293 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Invitrogen, Life Technologies), 1% penicillin-streptomycin, 1% glutamax. 107 cells were transfected with 5 μg of pcDNA Zeo containing the CXCR4 mutant genes (CXCR4.Y65F, CXCR4.Y76A, CXCR4.Y135F, and CXCR4.Y157A) using the FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Diagnostics, Meylan, France) according to the manufacturer's instructions. To construct stable HEK-293 cell lines expressing CXCR4 mutants containing deletions in ICL3, named CXCR4.ΔICL3-A, CXCR4.ΔICL3-B, and CXCR4.ΔICL3-C (55Brelot A. Heveker N. Montes M. Alizon M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23736-23744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar), 107 cells were cotransfected with 5 μg of pcDNA containing the CXCR4 mutant genes and 0.5 μg of pcDNA Zeo. Stable clones able to grow in the presence of 250 μg/ml zeocin were selected by flow cytometry for receptor surface expression. Flow Cytometry—Cells (1 × 105) were incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with 50 μl of PBS or PBS supplemented with the appropriate mAb. After three washings with PBS, bound mAb was revealed by addition of 50 μl of a 1:100 dilution of fluorescein-conjugated (FITC) secondary immunoglobulin. After 1 h of staining, cells were washed with PBS, and fluorescence intensity at 543 nm was measured on a EPICS XL4-C cytofluorometer (Beckman-Coulter). To study the direct binding of SDF-1α to CXCR4 expressed on transfected HEK-293 cells, 106 cells were incubated in 30 μl of PBS for 1 h at 4 °C to prevent subsequent internalization, and 30 μl of a SDF-1α solution at 200 nm was then incubated for 20 min at 4 °C after cell centrifugation. After washing with PBS, 30 μl of an anti-SDF-1α antibody at 10 μg/ml was added for 30 min, and bound Ab was revealed as described previously (54Roland J. Murphy B.J. Ahr B. Robert-Hebmann V. Delauzun V. Nye K.E. Devaux C. Biard-Piechaczyk M. Blood. 2003; 101: 399-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Calcium Signaling—The technique used was described previously (54Roland J. Murphy B.J. Ahr B. Robert-Hebmann V. Delauzun V. Nye K.E. Devaux C. Biard-Piechaczyk M. Blood. 2003; 101: 399-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Briefly, 107 cells were resuspended in Hank's solution (Invitrogen, Life Technologies, Inc.), loaded with Fluo-3-AM at 2 μm for 20 min at room temperature and stimulated with buffer alone or SDF-1α at 250 nm. Ionomycin at 10–6m was then added to verify the capability of the cells to induce a calcium influx. Ratio of fluorescence of bound to free Fluo-3 was analyzed each 10 s on an EPICS XL4-C cytofluorometer. SDF-1α Activation and Western Blot Analysis—Cells were starved of serum during 2 days at 37 °C, 5% CO2. After washing three times in PBS, 5 × 106 cells/ml were resuspended in 100 μl of PBS and incubated at 37 °C for 15 min. Cells were then stimulated with SDF-1α at 125 nm for the specified times at 37 °C and lysed in 50 mm Tris (pH 8), 1% Triton X-100, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 2 mm benzamidine, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 150 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, containing NaF, Na3VO4 and β-glycerophosphate. The proteins were subjected to electrophoresis through 10% SDS-PAGE and electrotransferred to polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes (Millipore). Membranes were then blocked in Tris-buffered saline (TBS), 0.05% Tween 20, and 10% milk for 1 h at 20 °C. Blots were incubated overnight at 4 °C with the primary antibody diluted in TBS-Tween-5% milk. After 3 washings with TBS-Tween, the blots were incubated for 1 h at 20 °C with peroxidase-coupled antiserum diluted 1:2000 in TBS-Tween-5% milk. After further washing, the immune complexes were revealed by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and subjected to autoradiography. Quantification of protein phosphorylation was performed by using the ImageJ program after autoradiography scanning. DNA Binding STAT3 Assay—After activation, cells were lysed in 50 mm Tris-HCl pH 7.9, 1% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 10 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mg/ml aprotinin. The oligonucleotide sequence GTC-GACATTTCCCGTAAATC was used to immunopurify DNA binding STAT3. After incubation for 1 h at 4 °C of the cell lysate with 1 μg of double-stranded, 5′-biotinylated oligonucleotide coupled to 30 μl of a 50% suspension of streptavidin agarose. Complexes were washed twice in lysis buffer and affinity-purified proteins were fractionated by electrophoresis, transferred to PVDF membrane as described above. Western blot analysis was performed with anti-P-STAT3 Ab and immunoreactive bands were visualized by chemiluminescence. In Vitro Jak2 Kinase Assay—Cells were starved of serum over 1 day at 37 °C, 5% CO2, and transfected with 2 μg of pRK5-Jak2 by using the FuGENE 6 transfection reagent. The following day, cells were resuspended in 100 μl of PBS, stimulated with SDF-1α at 100 ng/ml for 1 min at 37 °C, and lysed in 50 mm Hepes (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, 10 mm Na4P2O7, 100 mm NaF, 2 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm PMSF. After centrifugation, the pellet was resuspended in 500 μl of lysis buffer containing 1% Nonidet P-40 and incubated for 15 min at 4 °C. Jak2 was immunoprecipitated as described previously (54Roland J. Murphy B.J. Ahr B. Robert-Hebmann V. Delauzun V. Nye K.E. Devaux C. Biard-Piechaczyk M. Blood. 2003; 101: 399-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Briefly, 2 mg of proteins were used for immunoprecipitation with anti-Jak2 Ab and protein G-conjugated magnetic beads (Miltenyi Biotech) for 3 h at 4 °C. The immune complexes were then separated on magnetic columns and incubated in the presence of 2 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP in Tris buffer pH 7.4 containing 13.5 mm Mg2+ for 30 min at room temperature. After washing several times, phosphorylated products were eluted, loaded onto 10% SDS-PAGE, transferred onto PVDF membrane, and revealed by autoradiography. Phosphorylated Jak2 was identified by incubating the membrane with anti-Jak2 Ab. Membrane Protein Extraction—107 cells were washed in PBS and treated with 100 μg/ml of the membrane permeant cross-linking reagent DSP (3,3′-dithiopropionic acid di(N-hydroxysuccinimide ester)) for 1 h on ice. The reaction was stopped by adding PBS containing 100 mm glycine and 20 mm NEM (N-ethylmaleimide). After centrifugation for 5 min at 3000 × g, the pellet was resuspended in 150 μl of a lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 500 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, and protease inhibitors, and incubated for 30 min at 4 °C. After two steps of freezing in liquid nitrogen/thawing at 37 °C and centrifugation for 30 min at 15,000 × g, the supernatant containing the membrane fraction was subjected to electrophoresis. Gels were transferred to PVDF membranes, and Western blot was performed as described previously. CXCR4 was revealed using the anti-FLAG Ab. Immunoprecipitation—107 cells stably expressing wild-type CXCR4 or CXCR4.ICL3m molecules containing a FLAG at the C terminus were transiently transfected with 5 μg of pcDNA Zeo containing CXCR4 tagged at the N terminus with the HA epitope (CXCR4.HA) by using the FuGENE 6 transfection reagent. After membrane protein extraction and lysate preclearing by incubation with protein A Sepharose, CXCR4.HA receptors were immunoprecipitated using an anti-HA Ab and protein A Sepharose. To analyze CXCR4 tyrosine phosphorylation after SDF-1α activation, phosphorylated proteins contained in cell lysates were immunoprecipitated using an anti-phosphotyrosine Ab, and analysis was performed as described above. Statistical Analysis—Variance analysis was performed after arc sine transformation of the data (56Zar J.H. Biostatistical Analysis. Prentice-Hall, Upper Saddle River, NJ1996Google Scholar). *, p < .05; **, p < .01; ***, p < .001. Construction and Expression of the CXCR4 Mutants—To investigate the role of intracellular tyrosines of CXCR4 in Jak2/STAT3 activation pathway after SDF-1α binding, CXCR4 mutants containing single amino acid substitutions in which Tyr65 and Tyr135 were replaced by a phenylalanine and Tyr76 and Tyr157 by alanine were constructed and stably transfected in HEK-293 cells. We also used previously constructed HEK-293 cells expressing CXCR4 mutants in which each entire intracellular loop was modified (CXCR4.ICL1m, CXCR4.ICL2m, and CXCR4.ICL3m) and a HEK-293 cell line expressing a truncated form of CXCR4 (CXCR4.7TM) (54Roland J. Murphy B.J. Ahr B. Robert-Hebmann V. Delauzun V. Nye K.E. Devaux C. Biard-Piechaczyk M. Blood. 2003; 101: 399-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Modification of ICL1 has suppressed Tyr65, but not Tyr76 and CXCR4.ICL2m has lost Tyr135 in the DRY box but Tyr157 is still present. All these CXCR4 mutants express a FLAG at the C terminus end of the receptor. Finally, to define the domains of ICL3 involved in Jak2/STAT3 activation, stably transfected HEK-293 cells expressing CXCR4 mutants containing deletions in ICL3, named CXCR4.ΔICL3-A, CXCR4.ΔICL3-B, and CXCR4.ΔICL3-C, described previously (55Brelot A. Heveker N. Montes M. Alizon M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23736-23744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar) were constructed. The amino acids 227–230, 230–233, and 233–236 are deleted in, respectively, CXCR4.ΔICL3-A, -B, and -C. A schematic representation of CXCR4 mutants used for this study is described in Fig. 1. This diagram is based on that proposed by Doranz et al. (60Doranz B.J. Orsini M.J. Turner J.D. Hoffman T.L. Berson J.F. Hoxie J.A. Peiper C. Brass L.F. Doms R.W. J.

https://openalex.org/W2000362687,"Besides the core structure conserved in all troponin I isoforms, cardiac troponin I (cTnI) has an N-terminal extension that contains phosphorylation sites for protein kinase A under β-adrenergic regulation. A restricted cleavage of this N-terminal regulatory domain occurs in normal cardiac muscle and is up-regulated during hemodynamic adaptation (Z.-B. Yu, L.-F. Zhang, and J.-P. Jin (2001) J. Biol. Chem. 276, 15753–15760). In the present study, we developed transgenic mice overexpressing the N-terminal truncated cTnI (cTnI-ND) in the heart to examine its biochemical and physiological significance. Ca2+-activated actomyosin ATPase activity showed that cTnI-ND myofibrils had lower affinity for Ca2+ than controls, similar to the effect of isoproterenol treatment. In vivo and isolated working heart experiments revealed that cTnI-ND hearts had a significantly faster rate of relaxation and lower left ventricular end diastolic pressure compared with controls. The higher baseline relaxation rate of cTnI-ND hearts was at a level similar to that of wild type mouse hearts under β-adrenergic stimulation. The decrease in cardiac output due to lowered preload was significantly smaller for cTnI-ND hearts compared with controls. These findings indicate that removal of the N-terminal extension of cTnI via restricted proteolysis enhances cardiac function by increasing the rate of myocardial relaxation and lowering left ventricular end diastolic pressure to facilitate ventricular filling, thus resulting in better utilization of the Frank-Starling mechanism.

Cardiac muscle contraction is powered by actomyosin ATPase that is regulated by Ca2+ binding to the troponin complex (1Gordon A.M. Homsher E. Regnier M. Physiol. Rev. 2000; 80: 853-924Crossref PubMed Scopus (1314) Google Scholar, 2Leavis P.C. Gergely J. CRC Crit. Rev. Biochem. 1984; 16: 235-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). The troponin complex consists of three subunits: troponin C (TnC 1The abbreviations used are: TnC, troponin C; cTnI, cardiac TnI; cTnI-ND, N-terminal truncated cTnI; DTI, diastolic pressure-time integral; LVEDP, left ventricular end diastolic pressure; mAb, monoclonal antibody; MHC, myosin heavy chain; PKA, cAMP-dependent protein kinase; RT10, RT50, and relaxation RT80, total time at 10, 50, and 80% relaxation; STI, systolic pressure-time integral; TnI, troponin I; TnT, troponin T; WT, wild type. 1The abbreviations used are: TnC, troponin C; cTnI, cardiac TnI; cTnI-ND, N-terminal truncated cTnI; DTI, diastolic pressure-time integral; LVEDP, left ventricular end diastolic pressure; mAb, monoclonal antibody; MHC, myosin heavy chain; PKA, cAMP-dependent protein kinase; RT10, RT50, and relaxation RT80, total time at 10, 50, and 80% relaxation; STI, systolic pressure-time integral; TnI, troponin I; TnT, troponin T; WT, wild type.; the Ca2+-binding subunit), troponin T (TnT; the tropomyosin-binding subunit), and troponin I (TnI; the inhibitory subunit) (2Leavis P.C.

In addition to the core structure conserved in all TnI isoforms, cardiac TnI (cTnI) has an ∼30-amino acid N-terminal extension that is not present in fast and slow skeletal muscle TnIs. This N-terminal extension does not contain binding sites for other thin filament proteins (3Perry S.V. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1999; 190: 9-32Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Takeda S. Yamashita A. Maeda K. Maeda Y. Nature. 2003; 424: 35-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar) but contains serine residues 23 and 24, which are protein kinase A (PKA) substrates. With β-adrenergic stimulation, phosphorylation of these serine residues facilitates myocardial relaxation by decreasing the affinity of TnC for Ca2+ (5Solaro R.J. Holroyde M.J. Herzig J.W. Peterson J. Eur. Heart J. 1980; 1: 21-27Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 6Robertson S.P. Johnson J.D. Holroyde M.J. Kranias E.G. Potter J.D. Solaro R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 260-263Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In a rat tail-hanging model simulating the effect of weightlessness on the cardiovascular system, an N-terminal truncated cTnI was found to be up-regulated in the heart after 3–4 weeks of simulated weightlessness (7Yu Z.B. Zhang L.F. Jin J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15753-15760Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). This truncated cTnI is produced by restricted proteolysis, which removes the N-terminal amino acids 1–30. The restricted cleavage of cTnI selectively deletes the cardiac specific N-terminal extension, including the regulatory serine residues, but leaves the core structure intact (7Yu Z.B. Zhang L.F. Jin J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15753-15760Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). It has been established that long term exposure to a weightless environment results in decreased cardiac function (8Bungo M.W. Goldwater D.J. Popp R.L. Sandler H. J. Appl. Physiol. 1987; 62: 278-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 9Convertino V. Hoffler G.W. J. Fla. Med. Assoc. 1992; 79: 517-524PubMed Google Scholar, 10Perhonen M.A. Franco F. Lane L.D.

A number of cardiovascular adaptations to weightlessness in microgravity and simulated microgravity occur in response to redistribution of body fluids to the head and neck region (11Gaffney F.A.

In long term exposure to microgravity and simulated microgravity, this fluid redistribution results in increased renal discharge of Na+ and water to reduce circulatory blood volume and central venous pressure. According to the Frank-Starling relationship, cardiac function decreases as a result of this decreased preload. It is, therefore, important to investigate whether proteolytic removal of the cTnI N-terminal domain has a negative impact on myocardial contractility or whether it is a compensatory response to the decrease in cardiac preload. Characterization of the post-translational mechanisms in myocardial adaptation to long term exposure to microgravity will provide a better understanding of myocardial dysfunction in astronauts as well as in bedridden patients in which similar cardiovascular changes occur (10Perhonen M.A. Franco F. Lane L.D. Buckey J.C. Blomqvist C.G. Zerwekh J.E. Peshock R.M. Weatherall P.T. Levine B.D. J. Appl. Physiol. 2001; 91: 645-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). The N terminus-truncated cTnI is present in normal hearts of all species examined (7Yu Z.B. Zhang L.F. Jin J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15753-15760Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), indicating that proteolytic removal of the N-terminal extension of cTnI, including the PKA substrate sites, may be a novel mechanism to regulate cardiac function under physiological and stress conditions. Understanding the functional effect of this structural modification of cTnI will increase our knowledge of mechanisms regulating myocardial contraction and may also identify a molecular target for potential therapeutic enhancement of cardiac function. To develop an integrated experimental system for characterizing the effect of removing the N-terminal extension of cTnI on cardiac function, we developed transgenic mice with postnatal overexpression of N terminus-truncated cTnI that lacks amino acids 1–28 (cTnI-ND) for biochemical and physiological characterization. cTnI-ND cardiac myofibrils showed a lower affinity for Ca2+ than controls in actomyosin ATPase assay, similar to the effect of isoproterenol treatment. cTnI-ND hearts had a significantly faster rate of relaxation and lower left ventricular end diastolic pressure (LVEDP) compared with controls. The higher base-line relaxation rate of cTnI-ND hearts was similar to that of wild type (WT) mouse hearts under β-adrenergic stimulation. The decrease in cardiac output due to lowered preload was significantly smaller for cTnI-ND hearts compared with controls. These findings indicate that removal of the N-terminal extension of cTnI via restricted proteolysis enhances cardiac function by increasing the rate of myocardial relaxation and lowering LVEDP in order to facilitate ventricular filling for a better utilization of the Frank-Starling mechanism. Construction of a cDNA Template Encoding cTnI-ND—To investigate the effect of removing the N-terminal domain of cTnI on cardiac muscle function, we engineered cDNA encoding mouse cTnI with a deletion of amino acids 1–28, thus mimicking the naturally occurring proteolytic truncation previously observed (7Yu Z.B. Zhang L.F. Jin J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15753-15760Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). cDNA encoding intact mouse cTnI was cloned by reverse transcription-coupled PCR. Total RNA was extracted from ventricular muscle of an adult 129SvJ mouse using the TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The upstream (forward) and downstream (reverse) oligonucleotide primers were synthesized according to the published mouse cTnI cDNA sequence (17Guo X. Wattanapermpool J. Palmiter K.A. Murphy A.M. Solaro R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15210-15216Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) corresponding to the regions around the translation initiation and termination codons, respectively. The first strand mouse cTnI cDNA was synthesized from the total RNA preparation using avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase. Double-stranded cDNA including the entire coding region was then amplified by PCR and cloned into the pAED4 plasmid as described previously (18Biesiadecki B.J. Jin J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18459-18468Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Full-length mouse cTnI cDNA, including the 3′-untranslated regions and the poly(A) tail, was then reconstituted by pasting a restriction enzyme fragment, cloned by PCR from a unidirectional mouse cardiac cDNA λ-ZAPII phage library (19Jin J.-P. Wang J. Zhang J. Gene (Amst.). 1996; 168: 217-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) using a cTnI-specific forward primer paired with T7 primer in the downstream flanking vector sequence. The mouse cTnI cDNA was sequenced and verified by protein expression in Escherichia coli and Western blot identification using an anti-TnI monoclonal antibody (mAb) (TnI-1) (20Jin J.-P. Yang F.-W. Yu Z.-B. Ruse C.I. Bond M. Chen A. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 2623-2631Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). To construct a cDNA encoding the N terminus-truncated cTnI, an oligonucleotide primer was synthesized to create a translation initiation codon before Ala29 in mouse cTnI (Fig. 1A). An NdeI restriction enzyme site was included in the primer sequence for subsequent cloning. PCR-mediated mutagenesis was carried out on the full-length mouse cTnI cDNA template in pAED4 plasmid using the N-terminal deletion primer versus a3′-flanking primer in the vector sequences. The resulting cDNA construct was cloned into pAED4 plasmid (Fig. 1B) and sequenced to verify fidelity of the PCR and cloning procedures. The cDNA template encoding cTnI-ND was further verified by protein expression in E. coli and Western blot identification using anti-TnI mAb TnI-1 as described above. Production of Transgenic Mouse Lines Overexpressing cTnI-ND in Cardiac Muscle—In order to overexpress cTnI-ND in mouse cardiac muscle, we constructed a transgene using the cloned promoter of the mouse cardiac α-myosin heavy chain (α-MHC) gene (21Subramanian A. Gulick J. Neumann J. Knotts S. Robbins J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4331-4336Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (kindly provided by Dr. Jeffrey Robbins, University of Cincinnati) to direct a cardiac specific expression of the truncated cTnI cDNA in transgenic mice. Since the cTnI N-terminal truncation is observed as a post-translational regulator of myocardial function, the α-MHC promoter, which is up-regulated in mouse hearts after birth was used to avoid potential embryonic adaptations. The construction of the transgene is shown in Fig. 1C. The transgene DNA segment was cleaved from the recombinant plasmid by restriction enzyme digestion at flanking sites and isolated by agarose gel electrophoresis. After being recovered from the gel slice by electrophoresis elution and purified by the QIAfilter minicolumn (Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA), the linear transgene DNA fragment was used in the production of transgenic mice. Using fertilized eggs from C57 mice, the pronucleus injection and embryo reimplantation were performed at the Transgenic Core Facility at Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine. For the screening of the transgenic genotypes, genomic DNA was purified from mouse tail snips by the proteinase K digestion method (22Huang Q.-Q. Brozovich F.V. Jin J.-P. J. Physiol. 1999; 520: 231-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Transgenic founders were identified by PCR using an α-MHC promoter-specific primer versus a cTnI-specific primer (Fig. 1C). The transgenic founders were bred with wild-type C57 mice, and the progenies were screened by PCR as above. Positive F1 progenies from each transgenic founder line were verified for the expression of cTnI-ND in the cardiac muscle by TnI-1 mAb Western blot analysis. F2 generation with clear segregation of the transgene allele was used in this study for the characterization of cardiac function. All mice were provided food and water ad libitum and placed on a 12/12-h light-dark cycle, with the light cycle occurring during the daytime. All animal procedures were approved by the Case Western Reserve University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee and were conducted in accordance with the Guiding Principles in the Care and Use of Animals, as approved by the Council of the American Physiological Society. Verification of Cardiac Specific Expression and Myofilament Incorporation of cTnI-ND—Multiple types of somatic tissue were obtained from adult transgenic mice and homogenized in SDS-PAGE sample buffer containing 2% SDS. The protein extracts were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blot using anti-TnI mAb TnI-1 as described previously to verify cardiac specific expression of cTnI-ND. To examine incorporation of cTnI-ND into cardiac myofilaments, ventricular myofibrils were isolated as described previously (22Huang Q.-Q. Brozovich F.V. Jin J.-P. J.

To evaluate the effect of cTnI-ND on related myofilament proteins, the expression and myofibril incorporation of cardiac TnT in the transgenic mouse ventricular muscle was examined by Western blot analysis using an mAb CT3 as described previously (22Huang Q.-Q. Brozovich F.V. Jin J.-P. J. Physiol. 1999; 520: 231-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Preparation of Cardiac Myofibrils and Actomyosin ATPase Assay— Mice were anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital (50 mg/kg body weight, intraperitoneally). Hearts removed from transgenic or control mice were perfused in a retrograde manner, either with normal saline or with saline containing 20 nm isoproterenol. Cardiac myofibrils were prepared according to the method described by Solaro et al. (23Solaro R.J. Pang D.C. Briggs F.N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1971; 245: 259-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar) with modifications. These include the use of NaF (50 mm), EGTA (2.5 mm), and KH2PO4 as phosphatase inhibitors and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (0.2 mm) as a protease inhibitor (24Wu L.L. Tang C. Liu M.S. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: R408-R416PubMed Google Scholar). The ventricular muscle was pulverized in a food blender for 10 s in 50 ml of buffer containing 0.5% (v/v) Triton X-100, 60 mm KCl, 30 mm imidazole, pH 7.0, 2 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm dithiothreitol, incubated for 5 min, and centrifuged at 2,500 × g for 2 min. Pellets were washed three times in buffer containing 60 mm KCl, 30 mm imidazole, pH 7.0, 2 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. Actomyosin MgATPase assays were performed to titrate the Ca2+ sensitivity of the transgenic and wild type mouse cardiac myofibrils under constant ionic strength, using the stability constants compiled by Fabiato (25Fabiato A. J. Gen. Physiol. 1981; 78: 457-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar), and were performed at pH 7.0 with 50 mm imidazole, 50 mm KCl, and 2 mm MgATP at 37 °C. Inorganic phosphate release was measured as the amount of heteropolymolybdenum (26Fiske C.H. Subbarrow Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1925; 66: 375-400Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar) using an automated microtiter plate reader (Bio-Rad Benchmark) for optical density at 655 nm as described previously (27Rarick H.M.

Measurement of Left Ventricular Pressure Development in Vivo— Intraventricular pressure measurements were obtained in vivo using a Millar catheter (model SPR 671; Millar Instruments, Houston, TX) as per the method of Kass et al. (28Kass D.A. Saeki A. Tunin R.S. Recchia F.A. Circulation. 1996; 93: 1533-1541Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) with some modification. Briefly, mice were anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital as above, and a small abdominal incision was made to gain access to the mediastinum without disturbing the integrity of the thoracic cavity. An 18-gauge sheath was introduced into the left ventricle via the apex, and a 1.4 French Millar catheter was introduced into the left ventricle. Intraventricular placement of the catheter was confirmed by the systolic and diastolic pressure values recorded. The micromanometer was calibrated by submerging its tip into saline (37 °C), and a pressure of 100 mm Hg was applied. Functional Measurement of Isolated Working Mouse Hearts—Cardiac function of wild type and transgenic mice were measured at 5–6 months of age using the Langendorff-Neely isolated working heart preparation, at a constant preload of 10 mm Hg and an afterload of 55 mm Hg, as described previously (29Barbato J.C. Mulrow P.J. Shapiro J.I. Franco-Saenz R. Hypertension. 2001; 40: 130-135Crossref Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 30Gauthier N.S. Matherne G.P. Morrison R.R. Headrick J.P. J. Mol.

Physiol. 1967; 212: 804-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (900) Google Scholar). Mice were anesthetized as above, and the thoracic cavity was opened by a transverse incision to access the heart. Retrograde perfusion through the aorta was initiated within 60 s after removal of the heart. After establishing left atrial perfusion, the heart was switched to working mode. The hearts were perfused with Krebs-Henseleit bicarbonate buffer aerated with 95% O2, 5%CO2 at 37 °C (pH 7.4). The buffer contents were as follows: 118 mm NaCl, 4.7 mm KCl, 2.25 mm CaCl2, 2.25 mm MgSO4, 1.2 mm KH2PO4, 0.32 mm EGTA, 25 mm NaHCO3, and 11 mmd-glucose (29Barbato J.C. Mulrow P.J. Shapiro J.I. Franco-Saenz R. Hypertension. 2001; 40: 130-135Crossref Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Function of the isolated working hearts were measured on intrinsic beats at 37 °C with no artificial pacing applied. Aortic flow and coronary effluent were collected once every 2 min over a 30-min period. Heart rate and the maximum rate of pressure development (±dP/dt) were measured using an MLT844 pressure transducer (Capto, Horten, Norway) attached to the aortic cannula. The analog signal was amplified with an ML 110 Bridge Amplifier (AD Instruments, Colorado Springs, CO), sampled at 1000 Hz by a Power-lab/16 SP digital data archiving system (AD Instruments) and stored on computer disk for subsequent analysis (29Barbato J.C. Mulrow P.J. Shapiro J.I. Franco-Saenz R. Hypertension. 2001; 40: 130-135Crossref Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Due to the small internal volume of the catheter/transducer system (<10 μl), the force frequency response characteristics are adequate for measuring relative pressure-derived variables with frequencies approaching 14 Hz (29Barbato J.C. Mulrow P.J. Shapiro J.I. Franco-Saenz R. Hypertension. 2001; 40: 130-135Crossref Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Stroke volume (μl/g heart tissue) was calculated as the sum of aortic flow and coronary effluent, normalized to heart rate. Stroke work (ml·mm Hg/g of heart tissue) was calculated as stroke volume × average aortic pressure (diastolic pressure + one-third of pulse pressure) (mm Hg). During the collection of aortic flow, time to peak pressure and the relaxation times at 10, 50, and 80% total relaxation (RT10, RT50, and RT80, respectively) were measured from the pressure traces. Systolic and diastolic pressure time integrals (STI, correlating with myocardial energy expenditure (31Neely J.R. Liebermeister H. Battersby E.J. Morgan H.E. Am. J.

Isoproterenol Treatment—After base-line measurements were recorded, the cardiac response to β-adrenergic stimulation was measured by injecting pulsed volumes of perfusion medium containing increasing concentrations of isoproterenol (10, 30, and 50 nm, according to previous dose response analyses) into the left atrial perfusion tubing. Indicated by the increases in heart rates, the transit time for the injected dose to reach the heart was ∼30 s. Measurements were made 1 min after each injection during the plateau of the maximal response. Cardiac Function at Different Preload Pressures—To evaluate the effect of cTnI-ND on myocardial diastolic function, ventricular performance was measured in isolated working mouse hearts at various preloads of 3.5, 10, 15, and 20 mm Hg by altering the height of the left atrial perfusion reservoir. The low preload pressure of 3.5 mm Hg represents a level lower than the average in vivo LVEDP measured in anesthetized WT mice (Table I). The high preload pressure of 20 mm Hg represents a perfusion pressure at the upper portion of the ascending limb of the Starling curve (43Khairallah M. Labarthe F. Bouchard B. Danialou G. Petrof B.J. Des Rosiers C. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 286: H1461-H1470Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). During the experiments, shifts of preload were performed randomly, and the hearts were allowed to stabilize for 2 min at each preload before functional measurements were performed.Table IIn vivo measurements of cardiac functionWT (n = 6)H-cTnI-ND (n = 6)Heart rate (beats/min)549 ± 11554 ± 12LVPbLVP, left ventricular pressure.

Open table in a new tab Data Analysis and Statistics—Since the transgenic mice used in this study did not have any distinct coat or hood color markings, all functional experiments were performed in a blinded manner. cTnI-ND expression levels in all hearts used in functional studies were confirmed by Western blot using mAb TnI-1 as described above. Densitometric quantification of SDS-gel bands and Western blots was carried out using NIH Image 1.61 software. Based on an average heart weight of 0.130 g and an average heart rate of 467 beats/min, an estimated stroke volume of 139 μl/g of heart weight was predicted, based on data obtained from 60 isolated working wild type mouse hearts under the afterload of 55 mm Hg and preload of 10 mm Hg. This value was determined from the regression equation, y = 32.4x + 4.2, r = 0.83, where heart weight was plotted against stroke volume. Hemodynamic values (stroke volume, relative ±dP/dt, intrinsic heart rate, pressure-time integrals, systolic and diastolic durations, and peak/relaxation times) were initially tested for homogeneity of variance with a Levene test to determine whether a value was parametric or nonparametric (44Munro B.H. Statistical Methods for Health Care Research. Lippincott, New York, NY2001Google Scholar). Statistical significance was determined using either analysis of variance (for parametric parameters) or a Kruskal-Wallis analysis of variance (for nonparametric parameters). If a significant difference was identified by analysis of variance, multiple comparisons for parametric data were examined with a Scheffe post hoc test. For nonparametric data, if a significant difference was identified with a Kruskal-Wallis analysis of variance, multiple comparisons were performed using a Tamhane post hoc test. All statistical tests were performed with the use of SPSS statistical software. The 5% level of confidence was arbitrarily used for assigning statistically significant differences, and all data are presented as mean ± S.D. cTnI-ND Transgenic Mouse Lines—Four original transgenic mouse lines were obtained with successful segregation of the transgene allele. Western blots using anti-TnI mAb TnI-1 showed cardiac specific expression of the exogenous cTnI-ND (Fig. 2A). Similar to that previously observed in transgenic mouse hearts overexpressing slow skeletal muscle TnI (45Fentzke R.C. Buck S.H. Patel J.R. Lin H. Wolska B.M. Stojanovic M.O. Martin A.F. Solaro R.J. Moss R.L. Leiden J.M. J. Physiol. 1999; 517: 143-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar), overexpression of cTnI-ND resulted in a significant replacement of endogenous cTnI. Densitometry of Western blots showed that in wild type mouse hearts, cTnI-ND produced by endogenous proteolysis is within a range of up to 10% of the amount of total cTnI (intact plus truncated), similar to that"
https://openalex.org/W1974392546,"Naturally synthesized quinones perform a variety of important cellular functions. Escherichia coli produce both ubiquinone and menaquinone, which are involved in electron transport. However, semiquinone intermediates produced during the one-electron reduction of these compounds, as well as through auto-oxidation of the hydroxyquinone product, generate reactive oxygen species that stress the cell. Here, we present the crystal structure of YgiN, a protein of hitherto unknown function. The three-dimensional fold of YgiN is similar to that of ActVA-Orf6 monooxygenase, which acts on hydroxyquinone substrates. YgiN shares a promoter with “modulator of drug activity B,” a protein with activity similar to that of mammalian DT-diaphorase capable of reducing mendione. YgiN was able to reoxidize menadiol, the product of the “modulator of drug activity B” (MdaB) enzymatic reaction. We therefore refer to YgiN as quinol monooxygenase. Modulator of drug activity B is reported to be involved in the protection of cells from reactive oxygen species formed during single electron oxidation and reduction reactions. The enzymatic activities, together with the structural characterization of YgiN, lend evidence to the possible existence of a novel quinone redox cycle in E. coli.

Modulator of drug activity B is reported to be involved in the protection of cells from reactive oxygen species formed during single electron oxidation and reduction reactions. The enzymatic activities, together with the structural characterization of YgiN, lend evidence to the possible existence of a novel quinone redox cycle in E. coli. Quinones are biologically active molecules that function as lipid electron carriers for the transportation of hydrogen and electrons between the protein complexes of the electron transport chain. Both ubiquinone and menaquinone are synthesized by Escherichia coli for this purpose. However, although these compounds are essential for normal electron transport, it has been demonstrated that such quinonoids are also capable of diverting electron flow from the respiratory chain, and in doing, so cause increased intracellular production of superoxide radicals and hydrogen peroxide (1Hassan H.M. Fridovich I. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1979; 196: 385-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar). Benzoquinones and napthoquinones, such as menaquinone, are highly electrophilic and exhibit substantial thiol reactivity that results in their rapid reduction to semiquinone intermediates. This high redox potential is responsible for quinone cytotoxicity (2O'Brien P.J. Chem. Biol. Interact. 1991; 80: 1-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (1021) Google Scholar), which causes the oxidation of cellular macromolecules (3Bolton J.L. Trush M.A. Penning T.M. Dryhurst G. Monks T.J. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 2000; 13: 135-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (1403) Google Scholar). It is therefore extremely important that the cell maintains sufficient quinone levels for respiration while minimizing their toxicity. In addition to potential damage from endogenously synthesized quinones, organisms are also at risk of from environmental quinones, such as from the natural antibiotic compounds synthesized by Gram-positive bacteria. The ubiquitous distribution of quinonoids thus requires organisms to possess a specific defense mechanism. The metabolism and toxicity of menadione 1The abbreviations and trivial names used are: menadione, 2-methyl-1,4-naphthoquinone; MdaB, modulator of drug activity B; QuMo, quinol monooxygenase; DT-diaphorase, NAD(P)H:oxidoreductase. (2-methyl-1,4-naphthoquinone) have been extensively studied in mammalian cells (4Brunmark A. Cadenas E. Lind C. Segura-Aguilar J. Ernster L. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1987; 3: 181-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 5Iyanagi T. Yamazaki I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1970; 216: 282-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). Menadione is an analogue of menaquinone that differs only in the lack of an extended alkyl chain. DT-diaphorase, an NAD(P)H:oxidoreductase, is believed to reduce a variety of quinone substrates by means of a two-electron reduction mechanism. It has been demonstrated that the activity of this enzyme protects rat hepatocytes from menadione toxicity by competing with the potentially toxic one-electron reduction pathway employed by the electron transport chain and avoiding the generation of a semiquinone intermediate (6Lind C. Hochstein P. Ernster L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1982; 216: 178-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar, 7Lind C. Cadenas E. Hochstein P. Ernster L. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 186: 287-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar, 8Thor H. Smith M.T. Hartzell P. Bellomo G. Jewell S.A. Orrenius S. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 12419-12425Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The protein “modulator of drug activity B” (MdaB) was first identified on the basis of the protection it provided from the toxic effects of DMP840, adriamycin, and etoposide when overexpressed in E. coli (9Chatterjee P.K. Sternberg N.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8950-8954Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). It was later confirmed through protein sequencing that this protein corresponded to a DT-diaphorase-like enzyme previously purified from E. coli that demonstrated reductase activity toward menadione (10Hayashi M. Ohzeki H. Shimada H. Unemoto T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1273: 165-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Also, MdaB was reported to be up-regulated more than 20-fold in the cytoplasmic fraction of E. coli in response to 0.2-0.3 mm menadione (11Hayashi M. Hasegawa K. Oguni Y. Unemoto T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1035: 230-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Although early work suggested FMN and NADH dependence, later studies found MdaB to be FAD- and NADPH-dependent (10Hayashi M. Ohzeki H. Shimada H. Unemoto T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1273: 165-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Confusion as to the co-factor identities still remains. It has been suggested that induction of this enzyme may be an adaptive cellular response to minimize the toxicity of menaquinone and other quinone compounds. Recent studies of the MdaB homologue from Helicobacter pylori have demonstrated that the growth of mdab-deficient mutants is significantly inhibited by 10% oxygen environments and that these bacteria are diminished in their ability to colonize the stomachs of mice when compared with wild-type H. pylori (12Wang G. Maier R.J. Infect. Immun. 2004; 72: 1391-1396Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Although this work suggests that MdaB is particularly important for the protection of cells against oxidative stress, the quinol products of the reduction reaction are also capable of generating reactive oxygen species through auto-oxidative processes. Therefore, a detoxification mechanism involving MdaB must also include a mechanism for detoxifying the quinol reduction product. We have expressed a hypothetical open reading frame encoding the putative protein YgiN from E. coli K-12 and determined its three-dimensional crystal structure. Prior to structural determination, the function of this protein was unknown as no sequence conservation with proteins of known function could be detected. Using the RegulonDB data base (www.cifn.unam.mx/Computational_Genomics/regulondb/), a search of the E. coli genome positioned the b3029/YgiN gene immediately down-stream of the modulator of drug activity B (MdaB) gene and predicted that both proteins would be co-regulated by a single promoter (13Salgado H. Gama-Castro S. Martinez-Antonio A. Diaz-Peredo E. Sanchez-Solano F. Peralta-Gil M. Garcia-Alonso D. Jimenez-Jacinto V. Santos-Zavaleta A. Bonavides-Martinez C. Collado-Vides J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: D303-D306Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this report, we show that the three-dimensional fold of YgiN aligns well with that of ActVA-Orf6, a novel quinone monooxygenase from Streptomyces coelicolor thought to function via a two-election oxidation of quinol substrates in antibiotic biosynthesis pathways (14Kendrew S.G. Hopwood D.A. Marsh E.N. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 4305-4310Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Sciara G. Kendrew S.G. Miele A.E. Marsh N.G. Federici L. Malatesta F. Schimperna G. Savino C. Vallone B. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 205-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). We have also determined the structure of YgiN complexed with menadione. Further, we provide in vitro evidence that MdaB and YgiN form an enzymatic quinone reduction-oxidation cycle. We shall therefore refer to YgiN as quinol monooxygenase (QuMo). It is possible that such a redox cycle allows the cell to maintain a stable pool of quinones for electron transport while attenuating the potential toxicity of both quinone and quinol species. Crystallization and Data Collection—Recombinant QuMo (YgiN) was expressed in BL21 (DE3) E. coli cells under the T7 promoter. The expression construct contained a C-terminal hexa-histidine tag that permitted facile purification using batch elution over nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin (Qiagen). The final yield was 380 mg of pure protein/liter E. coli culture with no additional purification steps. All reagents for protein expression and purification were purchased from BIOSHOP Canada. All crystallization reagents were purchased from Hampton Research. The optimal crystallization conditions for the native protein were 1.5 m ammonium sulfate, 100 mm sodium citrate, pH 5.6, 0.2 m potassium/sodium tartrate, at 298 K using hanging drop vapor diffusion and a protein concentration of 15 mg/ml. QuMo protein was also expressed as a selenomethionine derivative in DL41 (DE3) E. coli in LE Master medium (16Hendrickson W.A. Horton J.R. LeMaster D.M. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 1665-1672Crossref PubMed Scopus (1008) Google Scholar) and purified as per native QuMo protein. The crystallization conditions for the selenomethionine protein were unaltered; however the protein concentration was decreased to 2.5 mg/ml, and the volume ratio of protein to reservoir solution was modified from 2:2 to 5:2. Co-crystals with menadione were generated by dissolving menadione sodium bisulfite in 50 mm NaH2PO4, pH 8, 300 mm NaCl followed by incubation with purified QuMo protein in a 20:1 ligand-to-protein molar ratio. The protein-ligand complex was then crystallized in 1.0 m ammonium sulfate, 0.1 m sodium citrate, pH 5.6, and 0.1 m potassium/sodium tartrate, at 298 K. All data were collected at cryogenic temperature. Data from the native QuMo crystal were collected at the F1 beamline at Cornell High Energy Synchrotron Source (Ithaca, NY) equipped with an ADSC Quantum-4 CCD detector. Single anomalous dispersion data were collected on the X9-A beamline at the National Synchrotron Light Source (NSLS) (Brookhaven National Laboratory, Upton, NY) during the Rapi-Data 2003 course using a Mar m-165 CCD detector. QuMo-menadione complex data were collected at the X6-A beamline, also at the NSLS, using an ADSC Quantum-210 CCD detector. Data were processed using DENZO and SCALEPACK (17Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38617) Google Scholar). The space group is cubic P4132 with unit cell dimensions a = b = c = 102.06 Å for the native crystals. The co-crystals are isomorphous to the native crystals. Structure Determination and Refinement—The QuMo crystal structure was determined by the single anomalous dispersion method using a selenomethionine derivative. The heavy atom positions for five of six selenium atoms were determined using SHELXD, and initial maps were generated using SHELXE at 3.0 Å (18Uson I. Sheldrick G.M. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1999; 9: 643-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar, 19Wang B.C. Methods Enzymol. 1985; 115: 90-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (943) Google Scholar). At this resolution, the map was easily interpretable and largely free of noise. Phase extension to 2.2 Å and density modification involving the native data were performed using RESOLVE (20Terwilliger T.C. Berendzen J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 849-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (3220) Google Scholar, 21Terwilliger T.C. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol.

Crystallogr. 2003; 59: 38-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar). The initial Cα positions were modeled as free water molecules, and the starting phase was refined using unrestrained refinement including prior phase from the RESOLVE results with iterative water refinements by ARP (23Perrakis A. Morris R. Lamzin V.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 458-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (2565) Google Scholar) using REFMAC5 (24Murshudov G.N. Vagub A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1997; D53: 240-255Crossref Scopus (13914) Google Scholar). The final model was built using the refined phases by ARP/wARP 6.0 (23Perrakis A. Morris R. Lamzin V.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 458-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (2565) Google Scholar). This model contained 103 of 104 residues from the native protein, although no density was observed for the C-terminal valine or the purification tag. There are 186 water molecules included in the final model. The coordinates for the native protein have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank under the accession code 1R6Y. Fold recognition searches were carried out using the Protein Structure Comparison Service Secondary Structure Matching at European Bioinformatics Institute (www.ebi.ac.uk/msd-srv/ssm) to search the Secondary Structure Classification of Proteins (SCOP) data base (25Krissinel E. Henrick K. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2256-2268Crossref PubMed Scopus (3189) Google Scholar). The QuMo-menadione complex structure was initially refined in CNS using the QuMo native structure (26Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16979) Google Scholar). Unambiguous density was readily observed in the active site, and a menadione molecule was placed accordingly. Water molecules were added, and the structure was further refined using REFMAC5 (24Murshudov G.N. Vagub A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1997; D53: 240-255Crossref Scopus (13914) Google Scholar). The coordinates have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank under the accession code 1TUV. Activity Assays of MdaB and QuMo—MdaB menadione reductase activity was assayed at 22 °C in a reaction mixture containing 50 mm NaH2PO4, pH 8.0, 0.2 mm NADH, 50 μm menadione, and 5 μm enzyme in a total volume of 1.0 ml. The activity was measured by monitoring the decrease in absorbance at 308 nm, resulting from the conversion of menadione to menadiol. QuMo activity was measured by the addition of this enzyme in a 1:1 molar ratio with MdaB to the reaction mixture once menadione had been completely reduced by MdaB. The activity of QuMo was demonstrated by an increase in absorbance at 308 nm corresponding to the oxidation of menadiol to generate menadione. Three-dimensional Fold of QuMo Suggests That It Is a Monooxygenase—The three-dimensional structure of QuMo from E. coli K-12 was determined using the single anomalous dispersion method and refined to 2.2 Å (Fig. 1a). The model was refined to 20.84 and 24.95% R and R-free values, respectively, with 94% of residues in the most favorable regions of the Ramachandran plot and the remaining 6% in allowed regions (Table I). The overall fold is of the α-β sandwich group of the α+β fold class and comprises a ferredoxin-like split βαβ-fold (27Orengo C.A. Thornton J.M. Structure (Lond.). 1993; 1: 105-120Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1a). A structural homology search yielded a good alignment with the structure of ActVA-Orf6, a novel monooxygenase from S. coelicolor, with a 1.9 Å root mean square deviation (15Sciara G. Kendrew S.G. Miele A.E. Marsh N.G. Federici L. Malatesta F. Schimperna G. Savino C. Vallone B. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 205-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1b). Both structures contain two βαβ motifs that form an antiparallel sheet in which strand B1 is positioned between strands B3 and B4. Poor overall identity is observed in multiple sequence alignments of QuMo with established members of the monooxygenase family. However, there is good alignment, both structurally and sequence-wise, for several conserved residues, including the QWES motif found in many members of this family, which is conserved in QuMo (see Supplemental Material).Table ICrystallographic data and refinement statisticsCrystalλDminObserved reflectionsUnique reflectionsCompletenessI/σ (I)RmergeÅÅ%%Native1.22.2281,912970099.9306.4Anomalous peak0.9793182,060770798195.8Menadione co-crystal0.97881.7722,48019,800100507Refinement StatisticsNative P41 32 (19.65-2.2 Å)Unique/free reflections9233/467R-factor/R-free (%)20.84/24.95Protein/water atoms1599/185r.m.s.d. bond lengths (Å)0.04r.m.s.d. bond angles (°)2.33Menadione:YgiN co-crystal P41 32 (25 to 1.7 Å)Unique/free relections19,800/1056R-factor/R-free (%)20.76/24.90Protein/water atoms1963/186r.m.s.d. bond lengths (Å)0.024r.m.s.d. bond angles (°)2.000Unit cell dimensionsP41 32: a = b = c = 102.057 Å, β = 90° Open table in a new tab A homodimer of QuMo is formed with a symmetry-related molecule from a neighboring asymmetric unit through an extensive hydrophobic interface that has a buried surface of 1728.5 Å2 (Fig. 2a). From dynamic light scattering experiments, QuMo also forms a homodimer in solution (data not shown). The interface between the two monomers of QuMo forms a hydrophobic pocket, primarily containing leucine and isoleucine residues. ActVA-Orf6 also forms a homodimer, in which the interface involves intermolecular interactions of tyrosine-tyrosine stacking and a tyrosine-histidine hydrogen bond between Tyr-63 and His-52, but these residues are not present in QuMo. As in the ActVA-Orf6 dimer, the QuMo dimer displays a swapped β-strand interaction in which the extended loop between strands B2 and B3 of one monomer contributes to the β-sheet of the other monomer by lying antiparallel to strand B4 (Fig. 2a). In ActVA-Orf6, this swapped β-strand is formed by an extended portion of the C terminus (residues 103-113) as the extended loop region is absent. The swapped strand contributes to the formation of the bottom of the active site and appears to be important for dimer stability, particularly in the absence of contributions from Tyr-63 and His-52 of ActVA-Orf6. Although the surface of each monomer consists of polar amino acids in the solvent-exposed areas, the charge localization of QuMo is opposite to that of ActVA-Orf6 (Fig. 2b). The entrance to the active site of ActVA-Orf6 displays a clustering of positively charged residues (Arg-73, Arg-86, and Lys-100). The active site entrance of QuMo, however, is substantially negatively charged and lacks any sequence identity to ActVA-Orf6. Similarly, the opposite face of the protein is negatively charged in ActVA-Orf6, whereas it is positively charged in QuMo. A β-turn positioned between helix A2 and strand B3 is also conserved between the two proteins and conforms to the class of type II β-turns. In contrast to previously identified monooxygenases, QuMo does not contain the strictly conserved Pro-44. Rather, Pro-44 is substituted by Glu-35. Glycine 45 of ActVA-Orf6, however, is structurally conserved by Gly-36 of QuMo. Substitutions within this region do not appear to alter the topology of the β-turn (Fig. 2c). Additionally, a type III β-turn located between strand B3 and helix A3 of ActVA-Orf6 is conserved. Although Ser-68 from ActVA-Orf6 is conserved in QuMo, Glu-69, Gln-70, and Ala-71 in ActVA-Orf6 are substituted by isoleucine, alanine, and histidine, respectively, in QuMo. These substitutions do not disrupt the topology of the turn (Fig. 2c). Multiple alignments of various homologues demonstrate that the Ser-68 is highly conserved, and our results are consistent with the hypothesis that this residue is important in maintaining the backbone of the N-terminal residues of helix A3. The Active Site—Monooxygenases of this type are small enzymes that oxidize relatively large, multiringed aromatic substrates. It is therefore not surprising that all secondary structural elements are involved in the formation of the active site. A slight disruption at the center of the helices results in the formation of helical arches over a rigid β-sheet floor. Although the rear of the ActVA-Orf6 cavity is closed by the swapped β-strand, the dimer interface of QuMo is not involved in the formation of the active site cavity. Rather, the side chains of helix A1 and strand B2 close the posterior of the QuMo active site. The studies of ActVA-Orf6 have implied that the enzyme does not require a metal ion or prosthetic group for catalysis (14Kendrew S.G. Hopwood D.A. Marsh E.N. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 4305-4310Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Sciara G. Kendrew S.G. Miele A.E. Marsh N.G. Federici L. Malatesta F. Schimperna G. Savino C. Vallone B.

Crystallogr. 2000; 56: 481-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). This is also the case for QuMo and likely for other monooxygenases of this family. There is no density that could be attributed to a metal ion, nor a clustering of appropriate residues that could serve as a metal coordination site. The native structure of ActVA-Orf6 suggested that 4 residues may be important for binding and/or catalysis of the hydroxyquinone substrate: Tyr-51, Asn-62, and Trp-66, belonging to the β-sheets, and Tyr-72, hanging from helix A3. Tryptophan 66 is the only residue of these to be conserved in QuMo; the others substituted with Pro-42, Met-62, and Leu-72, respectively. These differences may reflect alterations for the accommodation of different substrates. The ability of QuMo to bind quinonoid compounds was confirmed through co-crystallization of QuMo with menadione, a natural reaction product. The structure was refined to 1.65 Å with menaquinone clearly defined in the active site (Fig. 3). Two water molecules were also positioned in the active site, helping to coordinate menadione in the pocket via hydrogen bonding (Fig. 3b). The oxygen in the C1 position of menadione is hydrogen-bonded to a water molecule, which in turn hydrogen-bonds with the side chain γ-oxygen of Ser-85. The second coordinating interaction occurs between the first and second water molecules, the latter hydrogen-bonding to the backbone oxygen of Leu-76. The positioning of menadione permits the extension of the alkyl group out of the pocket, similar to the positioning of substrate analogues of Actva-Orf6, whereby the active site can accommodate much larger polyketide structure than the natural product (15Sciara G. Kendrew S.G. Miele A.E. Marsh N.G. Federici L. Malatesta F. Schimperna G. Savino C. Vallone B. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 205-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). QuMo Works in Concert with MdaB to Form a Quinone Cycle—MdaB co-purified with an associated flavin. This was made obvious by the intense yellow color of the purified protein, as well as a characteristic absorbance spectrum with a maximum at 320 nm. Activity was observed only with NADH supplementation; no activity was observed when NADPH was employed. This confirms the initial biochemical work, which suggested that this DT-diaphorase-like enzyme in E. coli was NADH-dependent (11Hayashi M. Hasegawa K. Oguni Y. Unemoto T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1035: 230-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). On the basis of prior experiments, this also suggests that MdaB is FMN-dependent. MdaB was able to completely reduce 50 μmol of menadione in 100 s, as measured by the consumption of menadione (308 nm) (Fig. 4). This is in agreement with previously reported data for the consumption of menadione by a DT-diaphorase-like enzyme purified from E. coli when NADH was provided for reaction (11Hayashi M. Hasegawa K. Oguni Y. Unemoto T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1035: 230-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The oxidation of menadiol to menadione was measured in the presence and absence of QuMo. QuMo at a final concentration of 5 μm was added to the MdaB reaction once menadione had been completely reduced to menadiol. A significant increase in the absorbance is notable after 60 s in the presence of QuMo (Fig. 4). No reduction of menadione was observed in control reactions containing MdaB alone or NADH alone. There was no detectable auto-oxidation of menadiol in the absence of QuMo over this time course, indicating that QuMo is indeed responsible for the oxidation of menadiol to menadione. Neither reaction was inhibited by the addition of heptyl-4-hydroxyquinoline-N-oxide. QuMo (YgiN), the b3029 gene product, was selected for structure-based functional discovery as its low sequence homology with proteins of known function made functional annotation difficult. The QuMo crystal structure was refined to 2.2 Å. The protein fold aligned well with that of the monooxygenase ActVA-Orf6 from S. coelicolor with an overall root mean square deviation of 1.9 Å, despite only 19% sequence identity. Most interesting was the structural alignment of the Trp-66 residue, one of which is strictly conserved across all members of this functional group and thought to play an important role in catalysis (14Kendrew S.G. Hopwood D.A. Marsh E.N. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 4305-4310Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Sciara G. Kendrew S.G. Miele A.E. Marsh N.G. Federici L. Malatesta F. Schimperna G. Savino C. Vallone B.

Crystallogr. 2000; 56: 481-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). The maintenance of β-turn topology in both QuMo and ActVA-Orf6 highlights the minimal effect of low sequence identity on the conservation of global protein fold. To date, this family of novel monooxygenases has been restricted to pathways responsible for the synthesis of large polyketide aromatic compounds, specifically the antibiotic biosynthetic pathways in Gram-positive bacteria. ActVA-Orf6 is such an enzyme, acting as a late-stage tailoring enzyme that confers functionality to dihydrokalafungin, a compound with antifungal activity. The existence of members of the novel monooxygenase family in Gram-negative bacteria, which are not known to synthesize polyketide antibiotics, suggests a hitherto unidentified cellular function for some members of this family and also indicates that the family is much larger than initially suspected. The combination of low sequence identity and lack of conservation of active site residues together with a restriction of structural homologues to Gram-positive bacteria has made confident functional annotation prior to structural determination difficult, if not impossible. Similar to its Gram-positive counterpart, QuMo does not appear to require metal ions or other co-factors for catalysis. On this basis, a protein radical mechanism in which the enzyme extracts a proton and electron from the substrate to yield a phenolic radical form of the polyketide substrate, which then reacts with molecular oxygen, has been proposed (29Fujii I. Ebizuka Y. Chem. Rev. 1997; 97: 2511-2524Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 30Shen B. Hutchinson C.R. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 6656-6663Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). This leaves a radical enzyme species. The conserved Trp-66 found in QuMo is generally considered the most likely candidate as an important residue in the radical reaction. The positioning of menadione in the active site is consistent with the structures of ActVA-orf6 bound to various substrate and product analogues. The alkyl group in position 2 of menadione points out of the cavity and does not appear to be important for substrate recognition. The large mouth of the cavity possibly allows the accommodation of the partially saturated polyisoprenoid alcohol chain, which can contain up to 13 isoprenoid units in in vivo menaquinone derivatives. This can be likened to the ability of ActVA-orf6 to accommodate much larger non-natural substrates, such as tetracenomycin F (15Sciara G. Kendrew S.G. Miele A.E. Marsh N.G. Federici L. Malatesta F. Schimperna G. Savino C. Vallone B. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 205-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Following the structure determination of ActVA-Orf6, a second enzymatic mechanism based on the auto-oxidation of anthrones was proposed, suggesting that the invariant Trp-66 is essential for the specific recognition of the C-11 hydroxyl from 6-deoxydihydrokalafungin through a hydrogen bond that orients the substrate in the active site with the indole NH acting as a hydrogen donor (15Sciara G. Kendrew S.G. Miele A.E. Marsh N.G. Federici L. Malatesta F. Schimperna G. Savino C. Vallone B. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 205-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). This hydrogen bond enhances the formation of a network of hydrogen bonds to the substrate and promotes the deprotonation of the hydroxyl group, leading to the formation of a C-6 carbanion. In contrast to ActVA-Orf6, QuMo lacks the Tyr-51, Asn-62, and Tyr-72 residues that are believed to be involved in the catalytic mechanism of ActVA-Orf6. The substitution of Asn-62 with Met-62 still permits the stabilization of the peroxy intermediate, whereas the functions of the tyrosine residues must be replaced by other amino acids in the active site, possibly Tyr-40 and Tyr-84. Met-81 and His-75 may also be in appropriate positions to be involved in catalysis. These substitutions may indicate a difference in substrate specificity between the two proteins. The differences in charge localization around the active site pocket are consistent with the postulated differences in substrate specificity between these monooxygenases. It has been suggested that the positively charged residues localized to the active site entrance of ActVA-Orf6 attract negatively charged hydroxyquinol substrates (15Sciara G. Kendrew S.G. Miele A.E. Marsh N.G. Federici L. Malatesta F. Schimperna G. Savino C. Vallone B. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 205-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). In contrast, QuMo possess a strong negative charge in the active site. This suggests that the substrate recognition mechanism of QuMo is more specific than general electrostatic attraction as the enzyme must overcome the anticipated charge repulsion that will occur during interaction of negative substrates in the negatively charged binding pocket. As QuMo is not part of an antibiotic biosynthetic operon, the genomic organization of E. coli was examined for insights as to a possible natural substrate of QuMo. Both QuMo and MdaB are highly conserved proteins. Orthologues of both proteins can be found in all kingdoms of bacteria and also the Archaea, and not only are the proteins themselves conserved but their genomic organization as well. The co-localization of QuMo and MdaB on the same promoter indicates that their functions are related, an argument strengthened by the fact that both act on quinone-derived substrates. From earlier work related to MdaB, menadione was identified as a possible substrate due to its overall structural similarity to substrates of the previously identified monooxygenases and the known ability of MdaB to reduce menadione, an analogue of menaquinone. We have been able to confirm the menadione reductase activity previously reported for MdaB and have shown it to be NADH-dependent. In addition, we have demonstrated the ability of QuMo to regenerate menadione from menadiol. As shown in Fig. 4, QuMo is able to rescue ∼50% of the initial amount of menadione, indicating at least an in vitro ability of QuMo to oxidize the reaction product of MdaB and form an enzymatic redox cycle. This work is the first to postulate the existence of the quinone redox cycle in E. coil, as well as to suggest that the function of MdaB may be coupled to the activity of another protein. Previous studies have demonstrated that MdaB expression is up-regulated more than 20-fold in response to menadione (11Hayashi M. Hasegawa K. Oguni Y. Unemoto T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1035: 230-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), indicating QuMo expression to be likewise up-regulated. The endogenous expression of QuMo in E. coli K-12 has been reported previously (31Wasinger V.C. Humphery-Smith I. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1998; 169: 375-382Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The response of the shared promoter of QuMo and MdaB to menadione coupled to the reported endogenous expression of these proteins under normal cellular conditions suggests that these proteins have a regular functional role in the cell, potentially in the protection of cells from oxidative damage. The role of an enzymatic redox cycle may be two-fold. Firstly, it is important for E. coli to maintain an intracellular pool of menadione, which is preferentially employed under anaerobic growth conditions, as well as ubiquinone. This would allow a seamless transition from aerobic to anaerobic respiration under low oxygen environmental conditions. Due to the instability and insolubility of quinone compounds, it would be exceptionally difficult for cells to safely maintain such internal stores without the formation of reactive oxygen species. A redox cycle, such as the one formed by QuMo and MdaB, avoids the formation of these toxic entities by employing catalytic mechanisms that bypass the formation of a semiquinone intermediate (Fig. 4). This is highlighted by the insensitivity of either reaction to heptyl-4-hydroxyquinoline-N-oxide (indicated by HOQNO in the figure), a typical inhibitor of single electron reduction reactions, which indicates that both proteins act through two-electron transfer mechanisms. Secondly, quinones are widely distributed in nature and are internalized by many cells, including those of mammals. Once inside the cell, these quinones are also able to generate reactive oxygen species. Thus, the QuMo-MdaB cycle would also act as a quinone buffer, owing to the broad substrate specificity for these types of proteins (12Wang G. Maier R.J. Infect. Immun. 2004; 72: 1391-1396Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 14Kendrew S.G. Hopwood D.A. Marsh E.N. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 4305-4310Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In conclusion, we have solved the structure of the first member of the novel monooxygenase family not involved in the biosynthesis of polyketide aromatic compounds. This indicates that these proteins may be more widespread than initially anticipated and suggests that many have not yet been identified because of the low overall sequence identity between these and more traditional family members. The structure of QuMo maintains the ferredoxin-like fold, similar to ActVA-Orf6, despite low sequence identity. However, differences in the positioning of active site residues, as well as differences in charge localization in the region, suggest a difference in substrate specificity between the two proteins. Most importantly, we have provided evidence that the QuMo protein may function along with MdaB to form a quinone redox cycle in E. coli that minimizes the formation of free radical species that otherwise pose a substantial threat to the cell. This work has allowed us to establish not only a functional annotation for the individual protein initially targeted but also to clarify the role of a closely related enzyme with opposing activity, thereby leading to the discovery of a possible novel quinone redox cycle in E. coli.

There is no evidence of increased in vitro spontaneous osteoclast formation in postmenopausal osteoporosis. The aim of our study was to evaluate spontaneous osteoclastogenesis in osteoporosis. Bone mineral density, markers of bone turnover, and cultures of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) on dentine slices with or without the addition of 1,25-OH vitamin D3 ([10(-8) M]) were obtained from 18 osteoporotic women and 15 controls. To verify cytokine production by PBMC cultures, supernatants were collected on days 3 and 6 and tested for TNF-alpha and RANKL. The data obtained were compared between patients and controls by one-way ANOVA and correlated by Pearson's coefficient. We found a significant increase in osteoclast formation and bone reabsorbing activity in patients with respect to controls; in addition, the production of TNF-alpha and RANKL is significantly higher in patients. Furthermore, osteoclast number is inversely correlated with bone mineral density and directly with RANKL in culture supernatants. Our data demonstrated an increased spontaneous osteoclastogenesis in women affected by postmenopausal osteoporosis: this increase may be explained by the higher production of TNF-alpha and RANKL by PBMC cultures of osteoporotic patients."
https://openalex.org/W2010850025,"Several signaling pathways that monitor the dynamic state of the cell converge on the tumor suppressor p53. The ability of p53 to process these signals and exert a dynamic downstream response in the form of cell cycle arrest and/or apoptosis is crucial for preventing tumor development. This p53 function is abrogated by p53 gene mutations leading to alteration of protein conformation. Hsp90 has been implicated in regulating both wild-type and mutant p53 conformations, and Hsp90 antagonists are effective for the therapy of some human tumors. Using cell lines that contain human tumor-derived temperature-sensitive p53 mutants we show that Hsp90 is required for both stabilization and reactivation of mutated p53 at the permissive temperature. A temperature decrease to 32 °C causes conversion to a protein conformation that is capable of inducing expression of MDM2, leading to reduction of reactivated p53 levels by negative feedback. Mutant reactivation is enhanced by simultaneous treatment with agents that stabilize the reactivated protein and is blocked by geldanamycin, a specific inhibitor of Hsp90 activity, indicating that Hsp90 antagonist therapy and therapies that act to reactivate mutant p53 will be incompatible. In contrast, Hsp90 is not required for maintaining wild-type p53 or for stabilizing wild-type p53 after treatment with chemotherapeutic agents, indicating that Hsp90 therapy might synergize with conventional therapies in patients with wild-type p53.

Biol. 1994; 59: 195-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The core region (residues 90–290) consists of the sequence-specific DNA binding domain and contains four of five regions that are evolutionarily conserved among vertebrates (14Soussi T. Caron de Fromentel C. May P. Oncogene. 1990; 5: 945-952PubMed Google Scholar). The p53 gene is the most frequently mutated gene in human cancer, occurring in about 55% of human tumors (15Lane D.P. Nature. 1992; 358: 15-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (4402) Google Scholar, 16Hollstein M. Hergenhahn M. Yang Q. Bartsch H. Wang Z.Q. Hainaut P. Mutat.

The majority of mutations are single amino acid substitutions in the DNA binding core domain of p53 (18Hollstein M. Rice K. Greenblatt M.S. Soussi T. Fuchs R. Sorlie T. Hovig E. Smith-Sorensen B. Montesano R. Harris C.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 3551-3555PubMed Google Scholar), producing a full-length protein that is incapable of binding DNA and is therefore nonfunctional as a transcriptional activator/repressor. The importance of the core region for p53 function as a tumor suppressor is underlined by the fact that 95% of more than 10,000 described mutations of the TP53 gene are clustered in the DNA binding domain. The mutations in the core region found in human tumors can be classified into two groups: (i) the contact mutants with changes in residues that are directly involved in contacting DNA, and (ii) the conformation mutants with changes in residues that are important for maintaining the structural stability of the core domain. Mutants can also be classified into three broad phenotypes based on their thermodynamic stability and DNA binding properties: (i) DNA contact mutations that have little effect on folding or stability of p53 protein (e.g. R273H); (ii) mutations that cause a local distortion, mainly in proximity to the DNA binding site (e.g. R249S); and (iii) mutations that cause global unfolding (e.g. mutation in the β-sandwich, e.g. V157F) (19Bullock A.N. Fersht A.R. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2001; 1: 68-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar). Many of these point mutations lead to loss of the wild-type protein conformation and can be detected by the loss of reactivity to the monoclonal antibody PAb1620 (20Milner J. Cook A. Sheldon M. Oncogene. 1987; 1: 453-455PubMed Google Scholar) or by the gain of reactivity to the monoclonal antibody PAb240 that recognizes mutant conformations of p53 protein (21Gannon J.V. Greaves R. Iggo R. Lane D.P. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 1595-1602Crossref PubMed Scopus (932) Google Scholar). The large frequency of mutants in cancer and their broad phenotypes open a promising strategy in cancer therapy that leads to rescue of p53 mutants and restoration of the tumor suppression activity. In particular, pharmacological reactivation of mutant forms of p53 protein which restore transcriptional activity toward proapoptotic genes has the potential to eliminate tumor cells through induction of cell death. Investigating the molecular mechanisms involved in the stabilization of wild-type and mutant p53 is therefore crucial for developing strategies to restore wild-type protein conformation as a basis for the development of new drugs targeting p53 in human cancer. The level of p53 protein is mainly regulated at the post-translational level by the MDM2 protein, whereas expression of MDM2 is activated by p53 at the transcription level, forming a negative feedback loop to maintain p53 protein at low levels under normal conditions (22Wu X. Bayle J.H. Olson D. Levine A.J. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1126-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (1614) Google Scholar, 23Barak Y. Juven T. Haffner R. Oren M. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 461-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (1165) Google Scholar). MDM2 binds to p53 and promotes its ubiquitination by acting as ubiquitin E3 ligase (24Haupt Y. Maya R. Kazaz A. Oren M. Nature. 1997; 387: 296-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (3629) Google Scholar, 25Kubbutat M.H. Jones S.N. Vousden K.H. Nature. 1997; 387: 299-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (2798) Google Scholar). It is well established that most stress signals that stabilize and activate p53 interfere with (i) the ability of MDM2 to promote p53 degradation, (ii) induction of the MDM2 inhibitor p14ARF, and (iii) inhibition of MDM2 expression. Phosphorylation of p53 on serine 15 by the ataxia-telangiectasia mutated kinase and serine 20 by human Chk2 kinase after DNA damage play critical roles in p53 stabilization by interfering with MDM2 binding. Stabilization of p53 also occurs in tumor cells with mutated p53, where missense mutations of p53 in the DNA binding core domain cause conformational change and stable association of this protein with molecular chaperones such as Hsp70 and Hsp90 (26Hinds P.W. Finlay C.A. Frey A.B. Levine A.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2863-2869Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 27Selkirk J.K. Merrick B.A. Stackhouse B.L. He C. Appl. Theor. Electrophor. 1994; 4: 11-18PubMed Google Scholar). It was shown that Hsp90 contributes to the accumulation of mutant p53 and that its binding to p53 inhibits the ability of MDM2 to promote p53 ubiquitination and degradation, resulting in the stabilization of both mutant p53 and MDM2 (28Nagata Y. Anan T. Yoshida T. Mizukami T. Taya Y. Fujiwara T. Kato H. Saya H. Nakao M. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6037-6049Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 29Peng Y. Chen L. Li C. Lu W. Chen J. J. Biol.

Chem. 2001; 276: 6874-6878Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Hsp90 appears to conceal the p14ARF binding site in the central domain of MDM2 in Hsp90·p53·MDM2 complexes and prevents MDM2 from ubiquitinating p53 and itself (31Wang C. Chen J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 2066-2071Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). In addition, Kamal et al. (32Kamal A. Boehm M.F. Burrows F.J. Trends Mol. Med. 2004; 10: 283-290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar) reported that Hsp90 derived from tumor cells has a 100-fold higher activity than does Hsp90 from normal cells. Inhibition of Hsp90 has been shown recently to be of potential therapeutical significance in various types of human cancer (33Workman P. Cancer Lett. 2004; 206: 149-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar, 34Beliakoff J. Whitesell L. Anticancer Drugs. 2004; 15: 651-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). The relationship between p53 mutants and Hsp90 activity is supported further by the recent demonstration that Hsp90β gene repression is mediated by wild-type p53 (35Zhang Y. Wang J.S. Chen L.L. Cheng X.K. Heng F.Y. Wu N.H. Shen Y.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 42545-42551Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), suggesting that the development of p53 mutation and increased Hsp90 activity can be coincident processes. Hence, modulation of Hsp90-assisted p53 folding has the potential for regulating mutant p53 activity in tumor cells. In this study we analyze the role of Hsp90 in mutant p53 conformational changes and stability of the wild-type p53 protein. We show that Hsp90 is required for both stabilization of mutated p53 and reactivation of human tumor-derived temperature-sensitive p53 mutants at the permissive temperature. Furthermore, we show that Hsp90 is necessary for transactivation activity of reactivated mutant p53 protein and its ability to induce downstream genes after a variety of genotoxic stresses, including cancer chemotherapeutic agents. These data highlight the importance of Hsp90 in regulating p53 function and the potential for manipulating the Hsp90-p53 interaction as an adjunct to cancer therapy. Cell Culture and Treatment—BT474 and MCF-7 are human breast cancer cell lines, and H1299 cells were derived from lung cancer. MCF-7 cells have a wild-type p53 gene, BT474 cells carry a temperature-sensitive mutation in the p53 gene (E285K) that adopts a wild-type conformation at 32 °C but has a mutant conformation at 37 °C. H1299 cells are p53-null. The BT474-RGC and H1299-RGC cell lines were established by stable transfection with a p53-responsive reporter construct (pRGCΔfosLacZ) that allows quantitative measurement of p53 transcriptional activity by β-galactosidase assay. Cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 300 mg/liter l-glutamine. Cells were grown at two different temperatures (37 and 32 °C) to 80% confluence before experimental treatments. Roscovitine, 6-benzylamino-2(R)-[[1-(hydroxymethyl)propyl]amino]-9-isopropylpurine, was added from a 50 mm stock solution in dimethyl sulfoxide to a final concentration of 20 μm. Cycloheximide was added from a 20 mg/ml stock solution to a final concentration of 10 μg/ml and geldanamycin from a 2 mm stock in dimethyl sulfoxide to a 2 or 4 μm final concentration. Control cells received an equivalent volume of dimethyl sulfoxide. For UV-C irradiation, BT474 and BT474-RGC cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) 1The abbreviations used are: PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; CMV, cytomegalovirus; ONPG, 2-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactopyranoside. and then irradiated in the absence of medium using a model 1800 Stratalinker (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Cytostatic drugs were add to the cell culture medium for a 12-h incubation at the following final concentrations: 1 μg/ml doxorubicin, 2 μg/ml oxaliplatin, and 20 μg/ml camptothecine. MCF-7 cells at 80% confluence were also stressed at 41 °C for period of 12 h. Transfection of BT474 and H1299 —The BT474-RGC and H1299-RGC cell lines were derived from BT474 and H1299 parental cells by stable transfection with the plasmid pRGCΔfosLacZ coding for β-galactosidase controlled by the p53-responsive RGC promoter element (kindly provided by Prof. D. P. Lane). Integration of pRGCΔfosLacZ was provided by cotransfection with pCMV-neo vector providing resistance to aminoglycoside antibiotics. Plasmids pRGCΔfosLacZ and pCMV-neo were mixed in the ratio of 5:1 and transfected into BT474 and H1299 cells using Lipofectamine 200 reagent (Invitrogen). Stable transfectants were selected at 2 mg/ml G418 sulfate (Invitrogen). Transient transfection of H1299 cells with the plasmids pcDNA3-wtp53, pcDNA3-E285K p53, and pCMV-A138V p53 were performed using Lipofectamine 2000 reagent.

Analysis of p53-dependent Transcriptional Activity—To measure p53-dependent transcriptional activity, β-galactosidase activity was determined in the human breast cancer cell line BT474-RGC or H1299-RGC stably transfected with the p53-responsive reporter construct (pRGCΔfosLacZ). Cells were washed with PBS, lysed in 0.25 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, by two freeze-thaw cycles and two 2-s ultrasound pulses at maximum intensity. The lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 20,000 g for 30 min at 4 °C. Protein concentrations in supernatants were measured using the Bio-Rad protein assay (Bio-Rad Laboratories), and β-galactosidase activity was assessed using a colorimetric assay with ONPG as substrate and absorbance at 420 nm (41Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 16.66-16.67Google Scholar). All experiments were performed in duplicate on at least three separate occasions. SDS-PAGE and Immunoblotting—Treated and control cells were collected by centrifugation (200 g, 10 min, 4 °C), washed three times with ice-cold PBS, and lysed by 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride buffer supplemented with protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma). 20 μg of total protein lysate was mixed with 2× Laemmli sample buffer. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE on 10% or 12.5% gels and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes in a Bio-Rad Trans-Blot SD semidry transfer cell for 1 h applying 200 mA in transfer buffer (240 mm Tris, 190 mm glycine, and 20% methanol). Prestained molecular mass markers (Bio-Rad) were run in parallel. The blotted membranes were blocked in 5% milk and 0.1% Tween 20 in PBS for 2 h at room temperature and probed overnight with specific monoclonal antibodies or rabbit polyclonal serum. To confirm equal protein loading, immunodetection was performed with the anti-actin AC-40 monoclonal antibody. After washing three times in PBS plus 0.1% Tween 20, peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse immunoglobulin antiserum or swine anti-rabbit immunoglobulin antiserum (DAKO) diluted 1:1,000 in 5% milk and 0.1% Tween 20 in PBS was used as the secondary antibody. To visualize peroxidase activity, ECL reagents from Amersham Biosciences were used according to the manufacturer's instructions. Immunoprecipitation—Cells were lysed in 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride buffer supplemented with protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma). Immunoprecipitation of conformationally different forms of p53 protein was performed using mouse monoclonal antibodies DO-1 (recognizing all p53 forms in native conditions), PAb240 (recognizing mutant conformation of p53 in native conditions), and PAb1620 (recognizing wild-type p53 form in native conditions), as described previously (21Gannon J.V. Greaves R. Iggo R. Lane D.P. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 1595-1602Crossref PubMed Scopus (932) Google Scholar). For both preabsorbtion of the lysates and isolation of the antibody-p53 complex, protein G-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) were used. For preparation of the lysate for immunoprecipitation of Hsp90 in complex with MDM2 and/or p53 we used lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.2% Tween 20 v/v, 10 mm sodium molybdate, 1.0 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and a protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma). cDNA Macroarray Analysis of Gene Expression—Briefly, total RNA was isolated with the Qiagen RNeasy system. Following the instructions provided with the Human p53 Signaling Pathway GEArray Kit (Superarray, Inc., Bethesda, MD), the isolated RNA was then used to generate biotin-labeled cDNA probes by reverse transcription. After hybridizing the biotinylated cDNA samples to the gene-specific oligomers prespotted on the nylon membrane, the chemiluminescence signal was generated with the streptavidin-alkaline phosphatase system and detected using Amersham Biosciences x-ray film. Densitometry—Protein and bound biotinylated cDNA levels were evaluated by densitometric analysis of photographic material. TotalLab software (Nonlinear Dynamics) was used to compute relative level of protein or biotinylated cDNA. Temperature-sensitive Phenotype of p53 in BT474 Cells— Point mutations in residues that are important for maintaining the structural stability of the core domain of p53 disrupt its native conformation, leading to exposure of the epitope recognized by the mutant-specific antibody PAb240 and simultaneous loss of the epitope recognized by the wild-type-specific antibody PAb1620 (21Gannon J.V. Greaves R. Iggo R. Lane D.P. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 1595-1602Crossref PubMed Scopus (932) Google Scholar). The cell line BT474 bears a temperature-sensitive mutant p53 (E285K) (42Jia L.Q. Osada M. Ishioka C. Gamo M. Ikawa S. Suzuki T. Shimodaira H. Niitani T. Kudo T. Akiyama M. Kimura N. Matsuo M. Mizusawa H. Tanaka N. Koyama H. Namba M. Kanamaru R. Kuroki T. Mol. Carcinog. 1997; 19: 243-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar) that accumulates in the nucleus at 37 °C, and its high level is unchanged after induction of cellular stress at this temperature. At 32 °C, this p53 mutant is reactivated and can perform wild-type p53 functions. To verify the use of these cells as a model for the reactivation of wild-type p53 function, BT474 cells were cultured at 37 or 32 °C with or without treatments that stabilize and activate wild-type p53. Proteins and mRNA were extracted for analysis of p53 levels and the expression of downstream target proteins and genes by Western blotting and cDNA macroarray analysis. Fig. 1 presents the results of Western blotting for p53 and the two downstream proteins, MDM2 and p21WAF1 in BT474 cells compared with MCF-7 cells that contain a wild-type p53 gene. Cells were untreated or exposed to UV light or the Cdk inhibitor, roscovitine, both strong activators of wild-type p53 (Fig. 1A). In MCF-7 cells, basal levels of p53 are very low but are increased by UV or roscovitine, and this increase is associated with induction of p21WAF1 and MDM2 proteins. In BT474 cells maintained at 37 °C, the basal level of p53 is much higher, p53 levels are not increased after treatments, and there is no induction of p21WAF1 or MDM2 proteins. After 20 h at 32 °C, the level of p53 is decreased, and treatment with UV light or roscovitine at 32 °C causes stabilization of p53 protein which is associated with induction of p21WAF1 and MDM2 proteins. We also used the BT474-RGC cell line (see “Materials and Methods”), which is stably transfected with a reporter construct expressing β-galactosidase under the control of a p53-responsive promoter element to test the usefulness of this approach as a simple method to assess and quantitate the transcriptional activity of the temperature-sensitive p53 mutant (E285K) directly. BT474-RGC cells are identical to the parental BT474 cell line in terms of their growth characteristics and in their expression of all studied proteins at both temperatures. Thus, at 37 °C (mutant p53 conformation), β-galactosidase activity was very low, whereas at 32 °C (wild-type p53 conformation), β-galactosidase activity was elevated and was further increased more than 2-fold by treatment with UV light or 20 μm roscovitine, confirming the use of β-galactosidase as a convenient marker of direct transcriptional activation by p53 in these cells (Fig. 1B). To investigate the generality of transcriptional activation of downstream genes, we used a targeted macroarray. Analysis of BT474 cells demonstrated a lack of induction of all p53 target genes by roscovitine at the nonpermissive temperature. Most p53-responsive genes are induced after culturing for 20 h at 32 °C compared with cells grown at 37 °C, compatible with p53 activation at the permissive temperature. Interestingly, although both p21WAF1 and MDM2 were further induced by treatment with roscovitine at the permissive temperature, other genes that are proapoptotic were not further increased in these cells, including Apaf-1, Bax, PIDD, and NOXA (Fig. 2).Fig. 2Analysis of gene expression. A targeted macroarray was used to investigate the generality of transcriptional activation of downstream genes. BT474 cells grown with or without 20 μm roscovitine at either 37 or 32 °C were used for total RNA isolation with the Qiagen RNeasy system. Isolated RNA was then used to generate biotin-labeled cDNA probes, which were hybridized to the gene-specific oligomers prespotted on the nylon membrane (Human p53 Signaling Pathway GEArray Kit). The level of cDNA probes was evaluated by densitometric analysis of photographic material. TotalLab software was used to compute relative levels of expression.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Post-translational Stabilization of MDM2 in the Presence of Mutant p53—The expression of MDM2 protein is activated by wild-type p53 but not by mutant p53 proteins that lack transactivational activity. Paradoxically, BT474 cells at 37 °C have high steady-state MDM2 protein levels even though p53 is not active at this temperature, a phenomenon described previously by Peng et al. (30Peng Y. Chen L. Li C. Lu W. Agrawal S. Chen J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6874-6878Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) in some cell lines carrying mutant p53 because of enhanced translation or stabilization of MDM2 protein. To address the mechanisms by which MDM2 protein levels are elevated in the presence of mutant p53 in BT474 cells, we measured mRNA levels on a commercial oligonucleotide array. In direct contrast to protein levels, MDM2 mRNA is low in cells maintained at 37 °C and is increased 6-fold at 32 °C. Treatment with roscovitine fails to induce MDM2 mRNA at 37 °C but induces a 2-fold further increase in cells with wild-type p53 conformation at 32 °C (Fig. 3A). These data demonstrate that MDM2 protein levels are regulated by post-translational mechanisms in BT474 cells and suggest that MDM2 protein is degraded rapidly in the presence of wild-type p53 but is stabilized in the presence of mutant p53. To investigate protein degradation as the mechanism for maintaining low levels of MDM2 in the presence of wild-type p53, we performed a more detailed analysis of MDM2 protein levels by Western blotting. The results confirmed the relative lack of full-length MDM2 protein in untreated cells at 32 °C compared with cells maintained at 37 °C. The analysis also revealed an increased proportion of shorter MDM2 protein forms in untreated BT474 cells maintained at 32 °C which were virtually absent from cells at 37 °C. Treatment with roscovitine reduced the amount of these shorter products and simultaneously increased the amount of full-length protein (Fig. 3B). The data are compatible with degradation of MDM2 in untreated cells with wild-type p53, and MDM2 stabilization as the main factor for elevated protein levels in cells expressing mutant p53. Hsp90 Contributes to Stabilization of Soluble Temperature-sensitive Mutant p53 Protein—The p53 protein is conformationally flexible as well as labile, and the Hsp90 chaperone is known to bind both mutant and wild-type p53 in vivo to stabilize these conformations. Binding of molecular chaperones to mutant p53 and MDM2 inhibits the ability of MDM2 protein to promote p53 ubiquitination and degradation, potentially resulting also in stabilization of MDM2. We analyzed complex formation among mutant p53, Hsp90, and MDM2 using immunoprecipitation followed by Western blotting. Our data show the participation of Hsp90 in complex formation and stabilization of both mutant p53 and MDM2 at 37 °C (Fig. 4). Th"
https://openalex.org/W2002160520,"The role of the degree of oligomerization in the structure and function of human surfactant protein A (SP-A) was investigated using a human SP-A1 mutant (SP-A1ΔAVC,C6S), expressed in mammalian cells, resulting from site-directed substitution of serine for Cys6 and substitution of a functional signal peptide for the cysteine-containing SP-A signal sequence. This Cys6 mutant lacked the NH2-terminal Ala–3-Val–2-Cys–1 (ΔAVC) extension present in some SP-A1 isoforms. SP-A1ΔAVC,C6S was assembled exclusively as trimers as detected by electron microscopy and size exclusion chromatography. Trimeric SP-A1ΔAVC,C6S was compared with supratrimeric SP-A1, which is structurally and functionally comparable to the octadecameric protein isolated from human lung lavages. SP-A1ΔAVC,C6S showed reduced thermal stability of the collagen domain, studied by circular dichroism, and increased susceptibility to trypsin degradation. The Tm was 32.7 °C for SP-A1ΔAVC,C6S and 44.5 °C for SP-A1. Although SP-A1ΔAVC,C6S was capable of binding to calcium, rough lipopolysaccharide, and phospholipid vesicles, this mutant was unable to induce rough lipopolysaccharide and phospholipid vesicle aggregation, to enhance the interfacial adsorption of SP-B/SP-C-surfactant membranes, and to undergo self-association in the presence of Ca2+. On the other hand, the lack of supratrimeric assembly hardly affected the ability of SP-A1ΔAVC,C6S to inhibit the production of tumor necrosis factor-α by macrophage-like U937 cells stimulated with either smooth or rough lipopolysaccharide. We conclude that supratrimeric assembly of human SP-A is essential for collagen triple helix stability at physiological temperatures, protection against proteases, protein self-association, and SP-A-induced ligand aggregation. The supratrimeric assembly is not essential for the binding of SP-A to ligands and anti-inflammatory effects of SP-A.

We conclude that supratrimeric assembly of human SP-A is essential for collagen triple helix stability at physiological temperatures, protection against proteases, protein self-association, and SP-A-induced ligand aggregation. The supratrimeric assembly is not essential for the binding of SP-A to ligands and anti-inflammatory effects of SP-A.

SP-A is a lipid-binding protein, a property that allows it to position and concentrate along with the extracellular membranes that line the alveolar epithelium and constitute the pulmonary surfactant. Thus, surfactant membranes containing SP-B and SP-C are bedecked with SP-A, which interacts primarily at bilayer surfaces. In relation to the surfactant system, SP-A catalyzes the formation of tubular myelin, improves the adsorption and spreading of surfactant membranes onto an air-liquid interface, and protects surfactant biophysical activity from the inhibitory action of serum proteins (1McCormack F.X.

At the same time, this tight binding of SP-A to surfactant membranes makes possible its strategic location at the front lines of defense against inhaled pathogens, toxins, and allergens. SP-A recognizes pathogen-associated molecular patterns on microorganisms, resulting in aggregation, opsonization, or permeabilization of microorganisms and facilitation of microbial clearance (1McCormack F.X.

Moreover, SP-A is capable of direct interaction with epithelial and immune cells in the alveolus through binding to cell membrane receptors. This results in modulation of immune cell functions such as phagocytosis of pathogens and apoptotic cells, chemotaxis, proliferation, cytokine production, respiratory burst, and expression of surface receptors (1McCormack F.X.

Thus, SP-A is involved in innate host-defense and inflammatory immunomodulator processes of the lung, as demonstrated by experiments with mice deficient in SP-A. These SP-A knockout mice show increased susceptibility to bacterial and viral infections (10LeVine A.M. Bruno M.D. Huelsman K.M. Ross G.F. Whitsett J.A. Korfhagen T.R. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 4336-4340PubMed Google Scholar) and enhanced inflammatory responses in the lung to a variety of stimuli (11LeVine A.M. Whitsett J.A. Gwozdz J.A. Richardson T.R. Fisher J.H. Burhans M.S. Korfhagen T.R. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 3934-3940Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). The binding capabilities of SP-A to surfactant membranes, pathogen-associated molecular patterns, and receptors on cell surfaces depend on its complex structure. SP-A belongs to the structurally homologous family of innate immune defense proteins known as collectins for their collagen-like and lectin domains. The primary structure of mature SP-A is conserved among different mammals with some differences. It consists of four structural domains: 1) an NH2-terminal segment involved in intermolecular disulfide bond formation; 2) a collagen-like domain characterized by 23 Gly-X-Y repeats with an interruption near the midpoint of the domain; 3) an α-helical coiled-coil domain, which constitutes the neck region between the collagen and the globular domain; and 4) a COOH-terminal globular domain involved in phospholipid binding and in Ca2+-dependent binding of oligosaccharides (12McCormack F.X. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1408: 109-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 13Head J.F. Mealy T.R. McCormack F.X. Seaton B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 43254-43260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). SP-A is modified after translation (cleavage of the signal peptide, proline hydroxylation, and Asn187-linked glycosylation). Unlike SP-As from other mammalian species, baboon and human SP-As consist of two polypeptide chains, SP-A1 and SP-A2. The major differences between mature SP-A1 and SP-A2 are in the collagen domain (14Floros J. Hoover R.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1408: 312-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The oligomerization domains in SP-A and other collectins are the coiled-coil domain, collagen triple helices, and the NH2-terminal segment. SP-A oligomerization is an intracellular process that is thought to occur in a zipper-like fashion along the C-terminal to N-terminal axis, as reported for other collectins (SP-D and MBL-C) (15Hoppe H.J. Barlow P.N. Reid K.B. FEBS Lett. 1994; 344: 191-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 16Wallis R. Drickamer K. Biochem. J. 1997; 325: 391-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Triple-helix formation from three polypeptide chains requires previous trimerization of COOH-terminal globular domains by a trimeric α-helical coiled-coil (13Head J.F. Mealy T.R. McCormack F.X.

Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 7015-7025Crossref Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Octadecamers appear to be formed by lateral association of the NH2-terminal half of six triple-helical stems, forming a microfibrillar end piece stabilized by disulfide bonds at the NH2-terminal region (19Voss T. Eistetter H. Schafer K.P. Engel J. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 201: 219-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 20Haas C. Voss T. Engel J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 197: 799-803Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) (see Fig. 1). In rat SP-A two cysteine residues are involved in multimer formation: a cysteine in the 6 position of the NH2-terminal segment (17McCormack F.X. Pattanajitvilai S. Stewart J. Possmayer F. Inchley K. Voelker D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27971-27979Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) and another cysteine in the position –1, which is the last position of the signal peptide, one amino acid before the NH2 terminus (18Elhalwagi B.M. Damodarasamy M. McCormack F.X. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 7015-7025Crossref Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Human SP-A, as well as recombinant human SP-A1 and SP-A2, expressed in mammalian or insect cells, also has considerable NH2-terminal heterogeneity, in which about 50–75% of human SP-A molecules contain Cys–1 isoforms (18Elhalwagi B.M. Damodarasamy M. McCormack F.X. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 7015-7025Crossref Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 21Wang G. Bates-Kenney S.R. Tao J.Q. Phelps D.S. Floros J.

Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 14041-14053Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In human SP-A1, four cysteine residues are potentially involved in the arrangement of the disulfide bonding: two cysteine residues in the NH2-terminal segment (Cys–1 and Cys6), another in the middle of the collagen-like sequence within the Pro-Cys-Pro-Pro interruption (Cys48), and a fourth cysteine at position 65 (Cys65) in the collagen domain near the neck. Cys65 is substituted by Arg65 in the human SP-A2 polypeptide chain (14Floros J. Hoover R.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1408: 312-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The first objective of this study was the production of a full-length mammalian cell-derived SP-A1 molecule that was not capable of forming higher oligomers than trimers. To this end, the cysteine at position +6 was removed by site-direct mutagenesis (Ser was substituted for Cys6). In addition, human IgG light-chain signal sequence was substituted for SP-A1 signal sequence to abolish the Cys–1 isoforms. The combined mutation eliminates potential inter-chain disulfide cross-linking within the NH2-terminal portion of the molecule. Using this approach, we produced a full-length mutant SP-A molecule (SP-A1ΔAVC,C6S) that is secreted as a trimer, utilizing a CHO K1 cell expression system. The second objective was the analysis of the structure and function of SP-A1ΔAVC,C6S in comparison with wild type recombinant human SP-A1, expressed in the same system, which has a supratrimeric assembly and is functionally comparable to the protein isolated from lung lavages of healthy subjects (22Garcia-Verdugo I. Sanchez-Barbero F. Bosch F.U. Steinhilber W. Casals C. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 9532-9542Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Although several studies have indicated the importance of the degree of oligomerization in mannose-binding protein and mammalian cell-derived SP-D (24Tuner M.W. Mol. Immunol. 2003; 40: 423-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar, 25Brown-Augsburger P. Hartshorn K. Chang D. Rust K. Fliszar C. Welgus H.G. Crouch E.C. J. Biol.

Chem. 2001; 276: 19862-19870Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), none have dealt with the functional importance of supratrimeric assembly in SP-A expressed in mammalian cells. These results are important in understanding the consequences of incomplete oligomerization, because the extent of oligomerization of human SP-A may be altered in various disease states and can vary among individuals (27Hickling T.P. Malhotra R. Sim R.B. Mol. Med. 1998; 4: 266-275Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Incomplete oligomerization occurs in insect cell-derived human SP-A1, which consists mainly of trimers and hexamers and low levels of higher oligomers (22Garcia-Verdugo I. Sanchez-Barbero F. Bosch F.U. Steinhilber W. Casals C. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 9532-9542Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 23Garcia-Verdugo I. Wang G. Floros J. Casals C. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 14041-14053Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Insect cells lack prolyl 4-hydroxylase activity. The lack of hydroxyproline perturbs the folding of recombinant human SP-A1, which influences the arrangement of disulfide bonding, affecting the oligomerization of nascent hydroxyproline-deficient SP-A1 (22Garcia-Verdugo I. Sanchez-Barbero F. Bosch F.U. Steinhilber W. Casals C. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 9532-9542Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In this study we report for the first time that the supratrimeric assembly is essential for the stabilization of the collagen triple helix of mammalian cell-derived human SP-A1 at physiological temperatures. The collagen triple helix of SP-A1ΔAVC,C6S is partially unfolded at 37 °C, which increases the susceptibility of the protein to proteolytic degradation. In addition, our results show that supratrimeric assembly of human SP-A1 is essential for 1) Ca2+-dependent SP-A self-association, 2) the capability of SP-A to induce aggregation of membranes and LPS micelles, and 3) the ability of SP-A to enhance surfactant interfacial adsorption. However, supratrimeric assembly is not essential for the binding of human SP-A to phospholipids and rough-LPS and for the anti-inflammatory activity of SP-A. Materials—Synthetic phospholipids, DPPC and DPPG, were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids (Birmingham, AL), and their homogeneity was routinely tested on thin-layer chromatography. Dansyl-DHPE, fluorescein, and fluorescenin-5-isothiocyanate (FITC, isomer I) were obtained from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Rough LPS from Salmonella minnesota (serotype Re-595), smooth LPS from Escherichia coli (serotype 055:B5), FITC-LPS from E. coli (serotype 055:B5), trypsin from bovine pancreas, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, and PHA were purchased from Sigma Co. The organic solvents (methanol and chloroform) used to dissolve lipids were high-performance liquid chromatography grade (Scharlau, Barcelona). RPMI 1640 medium, heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, and a Limulus amebocyte lysate kit were obtained from Bio-Whittaker (Walkersville, MD). Gradient SDS-PAGE gels were from NOVEX (Invitrogen). An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit for TNF-α immunoassays was obtained from BD Pharmingen (San Diego, CA). Macrophage-like cell line U937 cells were supplied by the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). Anti-CD14 (28C5) was kindly provided by Dr. Peter Tobias (The Scripps Research Inst., La Jolla, CA). All other reagents were of analytical grade obtained from Merck. Expression and Purification of Recombinant Human SP-A1—The recombinant wild-type form of human SP-A1 (6A2 allele) was expressed in stably transformed CHO K1 cells as described by Voss et al. (19Voss T. Eistetter H. Schafer K.P. Engel J. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 201: 219-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar) and purified from culture supernatant by mannose affinity chromatography. Endotoxin content was 200 pg/mg of SP-A1 as determined by Limulus amebocyte lysate assay. Cloning and Expression of Recombinant Human SP-A1ΔAVC,C6S Mutant—The genomic DNA sequence of the human SP-A1 gene contained in the expression vector as described in Voss et al. (19Voss T. Eistetter H. Schafer K.P. Engel J. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 201: 219-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar), was subcloned into the expression vector pEFmyc/cyto (Invitrogen) in which the myc epitope was removed after digestion with NotI/XbaI. Furthermore, the signal sequence of SP-A1 was replaced by the signal sequence Vκ21G of the light chain of a human IgG. The expression plasmid was introduced into CHO K1 cells by polyfectamine (Invitrogen) as transfection reagent using standard conditions. Stably expressing cell clones were selected in 1 mg/ml G418 and subsequently subcloned by limited dilution. For expression, the cells were grown in roller bottles using serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's F-12 supplemented with 10 mm Hepes and 1 mm ascorbate for hydroxylation as described previously (19Voss T. Eistetter H. Schafer K.P. Engel J. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 201: 219-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Purification of Recombinant Human SP-A1ΔAVC,C6S Mutant—Given that SP-A1ΔAVC,C6S trimers are poorly isolated by mannose affinity chromatography, we have developed a new method of SP-A isolation. SP-A1ΔAVC,C6S trimers were purified from culture supernatant by anionic exchange chromatography, size exclusion chromatography, and hydrophobic interaction chromatography. All chromatography steps were carried out at room temperature on an extended Äkta Purifier chromatography system (Amersham Biosciences), using sterile buffers. Typically, 5 liters of cell culture supernatant were centrifuged at 11,000 × g for 1 h, at 4 °C in a Sorvall Evolution RC centrifuge using a SLC-6000 rotor (Kendro Laboratory Products). The resulting supernatant was diluted with one volume of anionic exchange chromatography buffer A (20 mm borate, pH 10) to decrease conductivity, and subsequently sterilized by filtration (ZapCap Plus, 0.2 μm, Schleicher & Schuell, Dassel, Germany). The resulting 10-liter sample was then passed through a 50-ml Resource Q anion exchanger column (Amersham Biosciences) at 478 ml/h. Bound protein was eluted with a salt gradient elution, ranging from 0 to 45% anionic exchange chromatography buffer B (20 mm borate, pH 10, 1 m NaCl) at 190 ml/h flow rate. Fractions containing SP-A1ΔAVC,C6S were pooled, concentrated, and buffered into size exclusion chromatography running buffer (25 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 0.15 m NaCl; 2 mm EDTA; 0,02% NaN3) using an Amicon stirring chamber (Millipore, Schwalbach, Germany) with a 30-kDa cutoff nitrocellulose membrane. Two milliliters of the sample were then applied to a 300-ml Superdex 200 column (Amersham Biosciences) at a flow rate of 28 ml/h. Fractions eluting at an apparent molecular mass of 105 kDa contained SP-A1ΔAVC,C6S. These fractions were pooled, concentrated, and buffered into hydrophobic interaction chromatography buffer A (25 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 0.8 m (NH4)2SO4). After sterile filtration, a volume of 14 ml was applied to a 20-ml Phenyl-Sepharose HP column (Amersham Biosciences) at 90 ml/h, and SP-A1ΔAVC,C6S was eluted with a salt gradient elution, from 0 to 100% hydrophobic interaction chromatography buffer B (25 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5). Subsequently, the buffer was exchanged for 10 mm NaHPO4, pH 7.5, and the protein concentration was adjusted to 2 mg/ml. The endotoxin content was <0.5 enzyme units/mg SP-A (50 pg/mg SP-A) as determined by the Limulus amebocyte lysate assay. The purity of the final product was >95% according to the quantification using the Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100 system and the Protein 200 plus LabChip Kit (Agilent Technologies, Waldbronn, Germany). The suitability of this new method of SP-A isolation was checked with human SP-A from alveolar proteinosis. Human SP-A isolated by this new method exhibited structural and functional properties similar to the protein isolated by butanol and octylglucoside extractions (28Hawgood S. Benson B.J. Schilling J. Damm D. Clements J.A. White R.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 66-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar), but the endotoxin content was much lower. 2F. H. Bosch, F. Sánchez-Barbero, W. Steinhilber, and C. Casals, unpublished results. Isolation of Human SP-A—Bronchoalveolar lavages from alveolar proteinosis patients were used as a source of human SP-A. SP-A was purified from isolated surfactant using sequential butanol and octylglucoside extractions (28Hawgood S. Benson B.J. Schilling J. Damm D. Clements J.A. White R.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 66-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar) Endotoxin content of natural human SP-A isolated by this method was about 300 pg of endotoxin/mg of SP-A, as determined by Limulus amebocyte lysate test. Quantification of SP-A was carried out by amino acid analysis in a Beckman System 6300 High Performance analyzer as described elsewhere (29Casals C. Miguel E. Perez-Gil J. Biochem. J. 1993; 296: 585-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Protein Microsequencing—The NH2-terminal amino acid sequence of SP-A1 and SP-A1ΔAVC,C6S was determined using a modification of the technique of Edman degradation on an automated gas phase micro-sequencer (ABI Protein sequencer) as described previously (30Hunkapiller M.W. Hewick R.M. Dreyer W.J. Hood L.E. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 91: 399-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar). Proteins were submitted for analysis bound to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes after transfer from SDS-PAGE. The relative percentage of the SP-A isoforms was estimated by comparison of the molecular yield of representative amino acids from each sequence. Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis—Purity and apparent molecular weights of monomeric SP-As were determined by 12% SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions (5% β-mercaptoethanol). Proteins were visualized by silver stain (22Garcia-Verdugo I. Sanchez-Barbero F. Bosch F.U. Steinhilber W. Casals C. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 9532-9542Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Pre-stained See Blue (NOVEX) was used as molecular weight marker. To determine the assembly of disulfide-linked polypeptide chains of SP-A samples, 50 ng of each of the SP-As was separated on a precasted 4–12% gradient SDS-PAGE under non-reducing conditions. The SP-A proteins were detected by Western blotting using anti-human SP-A anti-serum raised in rabbits in a dilution of 1:100,000 and were visualized by chemiluminescence. The molecular weight of the disulfide-linked oligomers was determined by comparison with a molecular weight standard. For native conditions, electrophoresis was performed at 4 °C with a 7% Tris acetate polyacrylamide gel (NOVEX) in the absence of reducing agents as described previously (22Garcia-Verdugo I. Sanchez-Barbero F. Bosch F.U. Steinhilber W. Casals C. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 9532-9542Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Electron Microscopy—The sample preparation for electron microscopy was carried out as described in a previous study (19Voss T. Eistetter H. Schafer K.P. Engel J. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 201: 219-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). 25 ng of SP-A1 and SP-A1ΔAVC,C6S was dissolved in 0.2 m ammonium bicarbonate, pH 7.9, mixed with an equal volume of glycerol, and immediately sprayed onto freshly cleaved mica. Rotary shadowing by platinum/carbon and electron microscopy was done following protocols described previously (31Engel J. Odermatt E. Engel A. Madri J.A. Furthmayr H. Rohde H. Timpl R. J. Mol. Biol. 1981; 150: 97-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). CD Measurements—CD spectra were obtained on a Jasco J-715 spectropolarimeter fitted with a 150-watt xenon lamp (22Garcia-Verdugo I. Sanchez-Barbero F. Bosch F.U. Steinhilber W. Casals C. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 9532-9542Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 23Garcia-Verdugo I. Wang G. Floros J. Casals C. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 14041-14053Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 32Ruano M.L. Perez-Gil J. Casals C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15183-15191Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Quartz cells with a 1-mm path length were used, and the spectra were recorded in the far-UV region (190–260 nm) at the indicated temperature. Four scans were accumulated and averaged for each spectrum. The acquired spectra were corrected by subtracting the appropriate blanks, subjected to noise-reduction analysis, and presented as molar ellipticities (degrees·cm2·dmol–1) assuming 110 Da as the average molecular mass per amino acid residue. All measurements were typically performed in 5 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4, in the absence or presence of 1 mm calcium and 150 mm NaCl. Protein concentration in all cases was 120 μg/ml and was determined by amino acid analysis. For the analysis of thermal stability of the collagen-like domain of recombinant human SP-As, melting curves were monitored at 207 nm while the sample temperature was raised from 10 to 70 °C, with an average heating rate of 12 °C/h. SP-A concentrations were 120 μg/ml, and quartz cells with a 1-mm path length were used. The folded fraction was calculated from the equation: F = ([θ] – [θ]u)/([θ]n – [θ]u), where [θ] is the observed mean residue molar ellipticity at 207 nm, and [θ]n and [θ]u are the mean values for natural and unfolded SP-A, respectively. These values were obtained from the plateau before and after the transition. The temperature where the collagen triple helix of SP-A was 50% unfolded (F = 0.5) was taken as the melting temperature (Tm). Trypsin Digestion—To determine the protease sensitivity of SP-A1 and SP-A1ΔAVC,C6S at temperatures above and below the Tm of the corresponding protein, the recombinant proteins (2 μg) were incubated with trypsin (0.13 μg) in 5 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.4) as described before (32Ruano M.L.

https://openalex.org/W2007966378,"CLAC (collagenous Alzheimer amyloid plaque component) is a proteolytic fragment derived from a novel membrane-bound collagen, CLAC-P/collagen type XXV, that deposits in senile plaques associated with amyloid β peptides (Aβ) in the brains of patients with Alzheimer's disease. We previously showed that CLAC binds to the fibrillized form of Aβ in vitro, although the mechanism and the subdomains that mediate interaction of CLAC with Aβ as well as the effect of binding of CLAC on amyloid fibril formation remain unknown. Here we show that the collagenous domain 1 of CLAC, which is rich in positively charged amino acid residues, mediates its interaction with Aβ and that this binding is mediated by an electrostatic interaction and requires formation of the triple helix structure of CLAC. The soluble form of CLAC purified from the media of cells transfected with CLAC-P inhibited fibrillization of Aβ in vitro, especially in its elongation phase. These results suggest the anti-amyloidogenic roles of CLAC in the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease.

Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 741-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (5189) Google Scholar). The principal component of the amyloid deposits is amyloid β peptide (Aβ), which is proteolytically produced from a transmembrane precursor, βAPP, as 38-43-amino acid fragments (2Masters C.L.

Aβ secreted from cells exhibits a heterogeneity in its C-terminal extent; Aβ42 ending at the 42nd residue, which comprises ∼10% of Aβ40 in total secreted Aβ, aggregates much faster than Aβ40 (4Jarrett J.T.

Moreover, missense mutations in βAPP, presenilin 1 and presenilin 2 genes linked to early onset familial AD increase the production of Aβ42 (6Suzuki N. Cheung T.T. Cai X.D. Odaka A. Otvos Jr., L.

These findings collectively suggest that aggregation and deposition of Aβ are closely linked to the pathogenesis of AD. A number of non-Aβ proteinaceous components, e.g. apolipoprotein E (apoE), α1-antichymotrypsin, α2-macroglobulin, complement component C1q, amyloid P component, have been identified associated with senile plaque amyloids (9Dickson D.W. J. Neuropathol. Exp. Neurol. 1997; 56: 321-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (618) Google Scholar), some of which have been shown to affect fibrillization of Aβ (10McLaurin J. Yang D.S. Yip C.M. Fraser P.E. J. Struct. Biol. 2000; 130: 259-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Genetic polymorphism of apoE, especially the ϵ4 genotype, is known as the major genetic risk factor of AD (11Strittmatter W.J. Saunders A.M. Schmechel D. Pericak-Vance M. Enghild J. Salvesen G.S. Roses A.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1993; 90: 1977-1981Crossref PubMed Scopus (3727) Google Scholar), and accumulating evidence from experimental studies suggests that apoE may affect the fibrillization and deposition of Aβ, thereby leading to AD; ablation of apoE gene reduced Aβ deposition in transgenic mice overexpressing human βAPP, whereas further transgenic supplementation of human apoE ϵ4 gene accelerated deposition of β-sheet-rich Aβ (12Holtzman D.M. Bales K.R. Tenkova T. Fagan A.M. Parsadanian M. Sartorius L.J. Macker B. Olney J. McKeel D. Wozniak D. Paul S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 2000; 97: 2892-2897Crossref PubMed Scopus (733) Google Scholar). In vitro studies, however, showed that apoE also has an inhibitory effect on fibrillization of Aβ (13Evans K.C. Berger E.P.

Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6243-6250Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), implicating apoE in various aspects of β-amyloid formation in AD. These previous results emphasize the compelling need for the analysis of effects of other non-Aβ components of senile plaques on the fibrillization and deposition of Aβ. We have recently identified a novel collagenous protein as a component of senile plaque amyloid and designated it as CLAC (collagenous Alzheimer amyloid plaque component) (15Hashimoto T. Wakabayashi T. Watanabe A. Kowa H. Hosoda R. Nakamura A. Kanazawa I. Arai T. Takio K. Mann D.M.A. Iwatsubo T. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1524-1534Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). CLAC is derived from its precursor CLAC-P/type XXV collagen, a member of collagenous transmembrane proteins (16Franzke C.-W. Bruckner P. Bruckner-Tuderman L. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 4005-4008Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), specifically expressed in neurons. We also showed that the ectodomain of CLAC-P is shed by furin convertase and secreted as a soluble form of CLAC (sCLAC) (15Hashimoto T. Wakabayashi T. Watanabe A. Kowa H. Hosoda R. Nakamura A. Kanazawa I. Arai T. Takio K. Mann D.M.A. Iwatsubo T. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1524-1534Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Immunohistochemical analysis of postmortem human brains revealed a unique pattern of CLAC deposition in AD and Down's syndrome brains (17Kowa H. Sakakura T. Matsuura Y. Wakabayashi T. Mann D.M.A. Duff K. Tsuji S. Hashimoto T. Iwatsubo T. Am. J. Pathol. 2004; 165: 273-281Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar); CLAC was negative in Aβ42-positive, Aβ40-negative pure diffuse plaques that are considered to be the earliest form of Aβ deposition, whereas a fraction of primitive-type senile plaques became CLAC-positive at a relatively early stage of plaque maturation as the fibrillization of Aβ progresses. Notably, mature plaques that appear at later stages were Aβ40/thioflavin S-positive but remained CLAC-negative (17Kowa H. Sakakura T. Matsuura Y. Wakabayashi T. Mann D.M.A. Duff K. Tsuji S. Hashimoto T. Iwatsubo T. Am. J. Pathol. 2004; 165: 273-281Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). These findings suggested the possibility that CLAC may play an inhibitory role in the deposition of senile plaque amyloid by binding to early Aβ deposits and preventing further incorporation of Aβ peptides to develop β-sheet-rich, mature senile plaques. To test this hypothesis by in vitro experiments, we studied the effects of sCLAC on Aβ fibrillization in vitro and examined the mechanism as well as the subdomains that mediate interaction of sCLAC with Aβ. We found that sCLAC in its proper triple helix form binds to Aβ fibrils through the positive charge cluster within the collagenous domain 1 and that binding of sCLAC inhibits fibrillization of Aβ in the elongation phase of amyloid fibril formation, providing further support to the inhibitory role of CLAC in β-amyloidogenesis. Reagents and Chemicals—Synthetic Aβ-(1-40) and Aβ-(1-42) peptides were purchased from Peptide Institute, Inc. (Osaka, Japan). Aβ-(1-42) and Aβ-(1-40) used in experiments shown in Fig. 5 as well as Aβ-(1-28), Aβ-(1-16), Aβ-(17-42), and Aβ-(12-28) were purchased from AnaSpec (San Jose, CA).

Antibodies and Immunoblot Analysis—Anti-NC3 and anti-NC4 polyclonal antibodies were raised in rabbits against synthetic peptides corresponding to the NC3 (DYNGNLHEALQRITC) and NC4 (LGPDGLPMPGCWQK) regions of CLAC-P as described (15Hashimoto T. Wakabayashi T. Watanabe A. Kowa H. Hosoda R. Nakamura A. Kanazawa I. Arai T. Takio K. Mann D.M.A. Iwatsubo T. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1524-1534Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE was performed as described previously (8Tomita T. Maruyama K. Saido T.C. Kume H. Shinozaki K. Tokuhiro S. Capell A. Walter J. Gru ̈nberg J. Haass C. Iwatsubo T. Obata K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1997; 94: 2025-2030Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). The immunoblots were visualized using Immunostar reagents (Wako Pure Chemical) and visualized using LAS-1000plus (FUJIFILM) as described (8Tomita T. Maruyama K. Saido T.C. Kume H. Shinozaki K. Tokuhiro S. Capell A. Walter J. Gru ̈nberg J. Haass C. Iwatsubo T. Obata K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1997; 94: 2025-2030Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). Cell Culture and Transfection—HEK293 cells were cultured as described (8Tomita T. Maruyama K. Saido T.C. Kume H. Shinozaki K. Tokuhiro S. Capell A. Walter J. Gru ̈nberg J. Haass C. Iwatsubo T. Obata K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1997; 94: 2025-2030Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). Stable cell lines were generated by transfection of cDNAs using Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen) as described (15Hashimoto T. Wakabayashi T. Watanabe A. Kowa H. Hosoda R. Nakamura A. Kanazawa I. Arai T. Takio K. Mann D.M.A. Iwatsubo T. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1524-1534Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). In Vitro Binding Assay—The in vitro binding assay for sCLAC and fibrillized Aβ or heparin immobilized on a solid phase was performed as described (15Hashimoto T. Wakabayashi T. Watanabe A. Kowa H. Hosoda R. Nakamura A. Kanazawa I. Arai T. Takio K. Mann D.M.A. Iwatsubo T. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1524-1534Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Briefly, a 50-μl aliquot of 100 μg/ml heparin, bovine serum albumin (as a negative control), and prefibrillized synthetic Aβ-(1-42) (Peptide Institute, Inc.) was allowed to dry on wells of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay plates, blocked for 1 h with Block Ace (Snow Brand, Sapporo, Japan), and washed with PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20. Microplate wells were then incubated with conditioned media of HEK293 cells stably transfected with wild-type or mutant CLAC-P cDNAs for 1 h, washed with PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20, and then reacted with anti-NC4 antibody for 1 h. After incubation with a horseradish peroxidase-tagged secondary antibody, bound sCLAC was quantitated by development using a TMB microwell system (KPL, Inc.). The effects of ionic strength on the interaction between fibrillized Aβ and wild-type or mutant sCLAC were assayed as follows; conditioned media containing sCLAC were dialyzed against 10 mm phosphate buffer followed by the addition of NaCl to the final concentrations of 0 to 1 m and then loaded onto microtiter plates precoated with fibrillized Aβ. For the competition assays 200-μl aliquots of conditioned media were preincubated with 10 μg of prefibrillized Aβ (or Aβ fragment peptides) at 4 °C for 8 h and then loaded onto microtiter plates that were precoated with fibrillized Aβ-(1-42). Trypsin Digestion Assay—Trypsin digestion assays for the determination of the formation and preservation of the collagenous triple-helix structures were performed according to a previously described method (18Snellman A. Kera ̈nen M.R. Ha ̈gg P. Lamberg A. Hiltunen J.K. Kivirikko K.I. Pihlajaniemi T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8936-8944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Briefly, conditioned media containing wild-type or mutant sCLAC were dialyzed against 0.1 m Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) with 0.4 m NaCl buffer, heated at 20-60 °C for 5 min, and treated with 0.15 mg/ml trypsin at 20 °C for 2 min. The trypsin digests were subsequently inactivated by the addition of SDS sample buffer and boiling for 10 min followed by immunoblotting with anti-NC3 and anti-NC4 antibodies. Purification of sCLAC—Procedures for purification of sCLAC are summarized in the flow chart of Fig. 6A. Briefly, conditioned media of HEK293 cells stably expressing human CLAC-P were initially applied to a DEAE-cellulose column (DE52, Whatman), and the flow-through fractions were then applied to a heparin-Sepharose column (Amersham Biosciences) and eluted with phosphate buffer containing 1 m NaCl. The eluates were dialyzed against PBS, concentrated, and further separated by reverse phase HPLC on an Aquapore RP300 column with a linear gradient of 0-64% acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. Purified sCLAC in acetonitrile solution was evaporated and dissolved in 1 mm HCl at 0.1 mg/ml. In Vitro Aβ Fibrillization and Thioflavin T Fluorescence Assays—Synthetic Aβ-(1-42) or Aβ-(1-40) peptides were solubilized in 1,1,1,3,3,3-hexafluoro-2-propanol (Kanto Chemical Co., Inc.) at a concentration of 1 mg/ml and filtered through a 0.22-μm pore filter. Aβ or fragment peptides dissolved in 1,1,1,3,3,3-hexafluoro-2-propanol were dried and resolubilized in PBS including 2% Me2SO at 100 μg/ml and filtered through a 0.22-μm pore filter immediately before use. Purified sCLAC or α1-microglobulin (α1mG) was added into 50-μl aliquots of Aβ-(1-42) solution at molar ratios of 100/1 (Aβ/sCLAC or α1mG) and incubated at 37 °C for 0, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, or 24 h. After incubation, the aliquots were immediately put on ice, and 500-μl aliquots of 3 mm thioflavin T in 0.1 m glycine-NaOH (pH 8.5) buffer prechilled at 4 °C were added. Fluorescence levels of samples were assayed using fluorescence spectrophotometer F2500 (Hitachi) at λex of 443 nm and λem of 484 nm, respectively, and the fluorescence level of a 500-μl aliquot of 3 mm thioflavin T solution as the blank was subtracted. Average levels of fluorescence in three independent experiments were analyzed. Fifty-μl aliquots of Aβ-(1-40) (250 μg/ml) were incubated with purified sCLAC, apoE, or α1mG (molar ratio of Aβ/added purified proteins = 250/1) at 37 °C for 0, 1, 2, 4, 8, 24, or 48 h and immediately assayed as described above. To selectively examine the elongation phase of amyloid fibril formation by bypassing the nucleation phase, purified sCLAC, apoE, or α1mG were added to 50-μl aliquots of Aβ-(1-40) (100 μg/ml) at molar ratios (Aβ/proteins) of 100/1 in the presence of prefibrillized Aβ-(1-42) as seeds (molar ratio of Aβ-(1-40)/fibrillized Aβ-(1-42) = 100/1) and then incubated at 37 °C for 0, 1, 2, 4, 8, 24, or 48 h and immediately assayed as above. Negative Stain Electron Microscopy—Samples were spread on 400-mesh collodion-coated grids and then negatively stained with 2% phosphotungstic acid (pH 7.0) and viewed in an electron microscope (JEOL 1200EXII) as described (19Fujiwara H. Hasegawa M. Dohmae N. Kawashima A. Masliah E. Goldberg M.S. Shen J. Takio K. Iwatsubo T. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 160-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Negative-stain immunoelectron microscopy was performed as described (19Fujiwara H. Hasegawa M. Dohmae N. Kawashima A. Masliah E. Goldberg M.S. Shen J. Takio K. Iwatsubo T. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 160-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Briefly, samples were spread on grids and blocked by 1% gelatin containing PBS for 30 min and then incubated with anti-CLAC-P antibody for 1 h. After washing, the grids were incubated by anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody conjugated with 10-nm colloidal gold for 1 h and negatively stained and viewed by electron microscopy as above. Collagenous Triple-helix Structure of CLAC Is Indispensable to Its Interaction with Fibrillized Aβ—CLAC-P is a transmembrane protein with a type II orientation (Fig. 1A). We previously reported that CLAC-P is cleaved at Arg-112—Glu-113 by furin convertase, thereby liberating the extracellular domain as a soluble/secreted form of CLAC-P (sCLAC) (15Hashimoto T. Wakabayashi T. Watanabe A. Kowa H. Hosoda R. Nakamura A. Kanazawa I. Arai T. Takio K. Mann D.M.A. Iwatsubo T. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1524-1534Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). CLAC-P harbors three Gly-X-Y collagenous repeat motifs and forms a homotrimeric structure under non-reducing conditions (15Hashimoto T. Wakabayashi T. Watanabe A. Kowa H. Hosoda R. Nakamura A. Kanazawa I. Arai T. Takio K. Mann D.M.A. Iwatsubo T. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1524-1534Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). We examined whether sCLAC retains the triple-helix structure by a trypsin digestion assay. Native collagens with a triple-helix structure are resistant to digestion by authentic proteases including trypsin or pepsin, whereas heat-denatured collagen at >40 °C is susceptible to these proteases (18Snellman A. Kera ̈nen M.R. Ha ̈gg P. Lamberg A. Hiltunen J.K. Kivirikko K.I. Pihlajaniemi T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8936-8944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 20Bruckner P. Prockop D.J. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 110: 360-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). We heated conditioned media of HEK293 cells stably transfected with human CLAC-P containing sCLAC at various temperatures between 25-60 °C and then digested them by trypsin and found that sCLAC remained resistant to trypsin digestion by preheating at <45 °C, whereas it became labile at >50 °C (Fig. 1B). We previously reported that sCLAC is bound specifically to fibrillized form of Aβ by an in vitro solid-phase Aβ binding assay (15Hashimoto T. Wakabayashi T. Watanabe A. Kowa H. Hosoda R. Nakamura A. Kanazawa I. Arai T. Takio K. Mann D.M.A. Iwatsubo T. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1524-1534Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). To examine whether the triple-helix structure of sCLAC is required for the binding between sCLAC and fibrillized Aβ, we preheated conditioned media containing sCLAC at 25-60 °C and subjected them to the in vitro Aβ binding assay. sCLAC preheated at <45 °C was bound to Aβ, whereas sCLAC denatured at >50 °C failed to interact with fibrillized Aβ (Fig. 1C). This strongly suggested that the preservation of the collagenous triple-helix structure of sCLAC is the prerequisite for its interaction with Aβ fibrils. CLAC-P harbors two highly conserved, α-helical coiled-coil domains that are composed of repeats of heptad sequences (abcdefg; hydrophobic amino acid residues occur at positions a and d) that are shown to be important for the assembly of a set of membrane-bound collagens including type XIII collagen, a homologue of CLAC-P/type XXV collagen (21McAlinden A. Smith T.A. Sandell L.J. Ficheux D. Parry D.A.D. Hulmes D.J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 42200-42207Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), within the NC1 and NC3 domains (Fig. 2A). Moreover, it has been shown that type XIII collagen fails to form a triple helix and becomes misfolded when the NC1 coiled-coil domain is deleted (22Latvanlehto A. Snellman A. Tu H. Pihlajaniemi T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 37590-37599Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). We generated three mutant (mt) CLAC-P cDNAs (NC1ccmt, NC3ccmt, and NC1/NC3ccmt) in which the hydrophobic amino acid residues within the coiled-coil domains are replaced with lysine and stably expressed them in HEK293 cells. NC1ccmt CLAC-P was moderately sensitive to trypsin digestion, suggesting a partial impairment in the triple-helix structure, whereas the NC3ccmt and especially the NC1/NC3ccmt, CLAC-P, were highly sensitive to trypsin digestion without prior denaturation, indicating the lack of the triple-helix formation (Fig. 2B). We then tested the relationship between triple-helix formation of CLAC-P and sCLAC/Aβ binding by the in vitro Aβ binding assay. Binding of fibrillized Aβ relative to that with wild-type (wt) CLAC-P was slightly reduced in NC1ccmt CLAC-P, whereas it was significantly impaired with NC3ccmt CLAC-P and completely lost with NC1/NC3ccmt sCLAC polypeptides (Fig. 2C). These results clearly indicate that the collagenous triple-helix structure of sCLAC is indispensable to its interaction with Aβ fibrils. The Binding between Fibrillized Aβ and sCLAC Is Mediated by Electrostatic Interaction and Is Competed by Heparin—We previously reported that the interaction between fibrillized Aβ and sCLAC is blocked by a high concentration of NaCl (15Hashimoto T.

To examine the effects of ionic strength in more detail, we dialyzed conditioned media containing sCLAC against 10 mm phosphate buffer followed by the addition of NaCl at concentrations of 0-1 m and subjected them to the in vitro Aβ binding assay and found that the presence of high concentrations of NaCl inhibited the interaction between fibrillized Aβ and sCLAC (IC50 = 0.73 m) (Fig. 3A). The possibility that Aβ immobilized on wells were detached by a high concentration of NaCl was excluded by probing the plates by an anti-Aβ antibody (data not shown). These data further confirm that sCLAC is bound to fibrillized Aβ through an electrostatic interaction. We next investigated the interaction between sCLAC and heparin. sCLAC harbors one of the predicted binding consensus motifs for heparin (XBBXBX or XBBBXXBX, where B and X are basic and hydrophobic residues, respectively) (23Cardin A.D. Weintraub H.J.R. Arteriosclerosis. 1989; 9: 21-32Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) at 182IKRRLIKG189 in the NC2 domain. In addition, sCLAC has four positively charged amino acid cluster regions within its collagenous domains (Fig. 4A), where positively charged amino acid residues are frequently located at X and/or Y positions in the Gly-X-Y collagenous repeats. These domains are predicted to constitute a cluster of positive charges when CLAC-P or sCLAC form a native triple-helix structure. Such positive charge cluster has been implicated in the binding between collagen and heparin (24Keller K.M. Keller J.M. Ku ̈hn K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 882: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 25Mizuno K. Hayashi T. J. Biochem. 1996; 120: 934-939Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Taken together with the previous findings that type XIII and XXIII collagens bind to heparin (26Tu H. Sasaki T. Snellman A. Go ̈hring W. Pirila ̈ P. Timpl R. Pihlajaniemi T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 23092-23099Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 27Banyard J. Bao L. Zetter B.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 20989-20994Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), we suspected if one or the other of the four positively charged amino acid cluster regions of CLAC-P may serve as binding domains for heparin. We examined the binding of sCLAC and heparin by an in vitro binding assay, coating heparin onto microwell plates and found that sCLAC and heparin bind each other (Fig. 3B) and that the interaction is completely inhibited by the addition of 1 m NaCl (data not shown). These results suggested that sCLAC also was bound to heparin by an electrostatic interaction. To examine if heparin competes for the binding domain of sCLAC with fibrillized Aβ, we added different concentrations of heparin (0-1 mg/ml) to the conditioned media containing sCLAC in the in vitro Aβ binding assay and confirmed that heparin inhibits the binding between sCLAC and fibrillized Aβ in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3C). These results strongly suggest that fibrillized Aβ and heparin interacts with an identical subdomain in sCLAC. The Positively Charged Amino Acid Cluster in the COL1 Domain Is Crucial for the Interaction of sCLAC with Fibrillized Aβ—We found that the preservation of the collagenous triple-helix structure of sCLAC is required for its interaction with fibrillized Aβ, suggesting that Aβ fibrils recognize the three-dimensional structure, not simply the primary structure, of sCLAC. Furthermore, the heparin binding region of sCLAC seems to overlap with that for Aβ fibrils. These findings led us to hypothesize that one or more of the positively charged amino acid cluster regions within the collagenous domain may especially be important for the interaction of sCLAC with fibrillized Aβ (Fig. 4A). We then constructed five mt CLAC-P cDNAs (COL1mt, COL2mt, COL3-1mt, COL3-2mt, and COL1/3-2 double mt) in which the positively charged amino acid residues in the X and/or Y positions of the Gly-X-Y collagenous repeats were replaced with proline, the latter being the most common residue at the X or Y positions in collagens and contributing to the stability of the triple-helix structure. We stably expressed these mt CLAC-P cDNAs in HEK293 cells and confirmed that the mt sCLAC proteins also were secreted into culture media (Fig. 4B), forming an intact triple-helix structure as determined by trypsin digestion (Fig. 4C). COL1mt, COL3-2mt, and COL1/3-2 double mt CLAC-P polypeptides migrated slower than wt CLAC-P, presumably reflecting slight changes in charge or structure. In addition, the immunoreactivities of COL3-1mt, COL3-2mt, and COL1/3-2 double mt polypeptides to anti-NC3 or anti-NC4 antibodies were decreased by ∼50-75%, whereas those for COL1mt or COL2mt were preserved at similar levels to that for wt CLAC-P, possibly due to proximity of epitope locations and the mutated regions (data not shown). Considering these differences in the reactivity of detector antibodies in the in vitro Aβ binding assay, we have chosen to compare the binding affinities of mt sCLAC to fibrillized Aβ as the relative strength of the ionic interactions in each mutant. To this end we dialyzed conditioned media containing wt or mt sCLAC against 10 mm phosphate buffer and then added NaCl to final concentrations of 0-1 m and subjected them to the in vitro Aβ binding assay. The interaction between wt sCLAC and Aβ was inhibited by the addition of >0.5 m of NaCl (Fig. 3, A and D) and COL2mt, COL3-1mt, or COL3-2mt sCLAC showed almost similar inhibition profiles of Aβ binding to that with wt sCLAC (Fig. 4D). In sharp contrast, the interactions of COL1mt as well as the COL1/3-2 double mt sCLAC with fibrillized Aβ were inhibited by lower c"

The unique mechanisms responsible for this tightly regulated developmental process suggest the presence of an intrinsic genetic program composed of spermatogenic cell-specific genes. In this study, we analyzed the mouse round spermatid UniGene library currently containing 2124 gene-oriented transcript clusters, predicting that 467 of them are testis-specific genes, and systematically identified 28 novel genes with evident testis-specific expression by in silico and in vitro approaches. We analyzed these genes by Northern blot hybridization and cDNA cloning, demonstrating the presence of additional transcript sequences in five genes and multiple transcript isoforms in six genes. Genomic analysis revealed lack of human orthologues for 10 genes, implying a relationship between these genes and male reproduction unique to mouse. We found that all of the novel genes are expressed in developmentally regulated and stage-specific patterns, suggesting that they are primary regulators of male germ cell development. Using computational bioinformatics tools, we found that 20 gene products are potentially involved in various processes during spermatogenesis or fertilization. Taken together, we predict that over 20% of the genes from the round spermatid library are testis-specific, have discovered the 28 authentic, novel genes with probable spermatogenic cell-specific expression by the integrative approach, and provide new and thorough information about the novel genes by various in vitro and in silico analyses. Thus, the study establishes on a comprehensive scale a new basis for studies to uncover molecular mechanisms underlying the reproductive process."
https://openalex.org/W2101705648,"Structural analysis of the dimeric mitochondrial cytochrome bc1 complex suggests that electron transfer between inter-monomer hemes bL-bL may occur during bc1 catalysis. Such electron transfer may be facilitated by the aromatic pairs present between the two bL hemes in the two symmetry-related monomers. To test this hypothesis, R. sphaeroides mutants expressing His6-tagged bc1 complexes with mutations at three aromatic residues (Phe-195, Tyr-199, and Phe-203), located between two bL hemes, were generated and characterized. All three mutants grew photosynthetically at a rate comparable to that of wild-type cells. The bc1 complexes prepared from mutants F195A, Y199A, and F203A have, respectively, 78%, 100%, and 100% of ubiquinol-cytochrome c reductase activity found in the wild-type complex. Replacing the Phe-195 of cytochrome b with Tyr, His, or Trp results in mutant complexes (F195Y, F195H, or F195W) having the same ubiquinol-cytochrome c reductase activity as the wild-type. These results indicate that the aromatic group at position195 of cytochrome b is involved in electron transfer reactions of the bc1 complex. The rate of superoxide anion (O2·¯) generation, measured by the chemiluminescence of 2-methyl-6-(p-methoxyphenyl)-3,7-dihydroimidazo[1,2-α]pyrazin-3-one hydrochloride-O2·¯ adduct during oxidation of ubiquinol, is 3 times higher in the F195A complex than in the wild-type or mutant complexes Y199A or F203A. This supports the idea that the interruption of electron transfer between the two bL hemes enhances electron leakage to oxygen and thus decreases the ubiquinol-cytochrome c reductase activity.

This supports the idea that the interruption of electron transfer between the two bL hemes enhances electron leakage to oxygen and thus decreases the ubiquinol-cytochrome c reductase activity. The cytochrome bc1 complex (also known as ubiquinol-cytochrome c reductase or Complex III) is an essential segment of the electron transfer chains of mitochondria and many respiratory and photosynthetic bacteria (1Trumpower B.L. Gennis R.B. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 675-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). It catalyzes electron transfer from ubiquinol to cytochrome c with concomitant translocation of protons across the membrane to generate a proton gradient and membrane potential for ATP synthesis. The “proton-motive Q-cycle” is the most favored mechanism for electron and proton transfer in this complex (2Mitchell P. J. Theor. Biol. 1976; 62: 327-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (925) Google Scholar, 3Brandt U. Trumpower B. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1994; 29: 165-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). The central feature of the Q-cycle mechanism is the bifurcation of electrons from ubiquinol at the Qo site. The first electron of ubiquinol is transferred to the “high potential chain,” consisting of the Rieske [2Fe-2S] cluster, housed in the iron-sulfur protein (ISP), 1The abbreviations used are: ISP, iron-sulfur protein; O2·¯, superoxide anion; MCLA, 2-methyl-6-(4-methoxyphenyl)-3,7-dihydroimidazol[1,2-α]pyrazin-3-one, hydrochloride; Q0C10BrH2, 2,3-dimethoxy-5-methyl-6-(10-bromodecyl)-1,4-benzoquinol; MCLA, 2-methyl-6-(4-methoxyphenyl)-3,7-dihydroimidazol[1,2-α]pyrazin-3-one, hydrochloride; XO, xanthine oxidase unit(s). and heme c1, housed in cytochrome c1. Then the second electron of ubiquinol is passed through the “low potential chain” consisting of heme bL and heme bH, both housed in the cytochrome b subunit.

The structural information not only supports the Q-cycle mechanism but also suggests the complex functioning as a dimer. This suggestion stems from the following structural data (4Xia D. Yu C.A.

The short distance between the two hemes bL and the presence of several aromatic amino acid residues at the interface of the two cytochrome b proteins has promoted investigator to speculate the existence of electron transfer or equilibrating between the two hemes bL (8Soriano G.M.

However, evidence for inter-monomer bL-bL electron transfer during bc1 catalysis is still missing, due to the lack of a suitable assay method. It has been reported that during electron transfer through the bc1 complex, superoxide anion ((O2·¯) is produced (12Turrens J.F. Alexandre A. Lehninger A.L. Arch. Biochem.

This results from a leakage of the second electron of ubiquinol, from the low potential chain of the Q cycle electron transfer pathway, to interact with molecular oxygen. The electron-leaking site is thought to be located at the reduced cytochrome bL or ubisemiquinone of the Qo site (12Turrens J.F. Alexandre A. Lehninger A.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1985; 237: 408-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (1070) Google Scholar, 13Nohl H. Jordan W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1986; 138: 533-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 14Zhang L.

The amount of electron leakage is believed to be proportional to the concentration of reduced cytochrome bL or ubisemiquinone at the Qo site. Thus, if the inter-monomer bL-bL electron transfer is interrupted, one should see an increase in the rate of O2·¯ generation, because electrons that normally shuttle between the two bL hemes will accumulate at the bL heme of one monomer, thus enhancing the chance for leakage and reaction with oxygen. In the three-dimensional structure of mitochondrial bc1 complex, several pairs of aromatic residues are located at the dimer interface between the two hemes bL (4Xia D. Yu C.A. Kim H. Xia J.Z. Kachurin A.M. Zhang L. Yu L. Deisenhofer J. Science. 1997; 277: 60-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (873) Google Scholar). These aromatic pairs may facilitate the inter-monomer heme bL-bL electron transfer. If this is indeed the case the existence of inter-monomer heme bL-bL electron transfer in the bc1 complex can be revealed by comparing the rates of O2·¯ generation by the wild-type bc1 complex with those of mutant complexes having these aromatic pairs replaced with non-aromatic residues. An increase in O2·¯ generation, as a result of increasing the concentration of reduced bL or ubisemiquinone at the Qo site, by the mutant bc1 complex, would indicate inter-monomer heme bL-bL electron transfer, involving aromatic amino acid residues. Herein we report procedures for generating R. sphaeroides mutants expressing His6-tagged bc1 complexes with mutations at three highly conserved aromatic residues (Phe-195, Tyr-199, and Phe-203) located between the two bL hemes of the dimeric complex. The rate of superoxide anion generation, the effect of oxygen on the activity, and the EPR characteristics of the cytochromes bL and bH in purified complexes from wild type and mutant strains are examined and compared.

The presence of engineered mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing of the 962-bp BstEII-XbaI fragment before and after photosynthetic growth of the cells as previously reported (21Mather M.W. Yu L. Yu C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28668-28675Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). DNA sequencing and oligonucleotide syntheses were performed by the Recombinant DNA/Protein Core Facility at Oklahoma State University. Growth of Bacteria—E. coli cells were grown at 37 °C in LB medium (sodium chloride, SELECT peptone 140, and SELECT yeast extract, autolyzed low sodium). For photosynthetic growth of the plasmid-bearing R. sphaeroides BC17 cells an enriched Siström's medium containing 5 mm glutamate and 0.2% casamino acids was used. Photosynthetic growth conditions for R. sphaeroides were essentially as described previously (21Mather M.W. Yu L. Yu C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28668-28675Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Cells harboring the mutated cytochrome b gene on the pRKD418-fbcFBmCHQ plasmid were grown photosynthetically for one or two serial passages to minimize any pressure for reversion. The inoculation volumes used for photosynthetic cultures were at least 5% of the total volume. Antibiotics were added to the following concentrations: ampicillin (125 μg/ml), kanamycin sulfate (30 μg/ml), tetracycline (10 μg/ml for E. coli and 1 μg/ml for R. sphaeroides), and trimethoprim (100 μg/ml for E. coli and 30 μg/ml for R. sphaeroides). Enzyme Preparations and Activity Assay—Chromatophores were prepared, from which the His6-tagged cytochrome bc1 complexes were purified, as previously reported (22Tian H. Yu L. Mather M.W. Yu C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27953-27959Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). To assay cytochrome bc1 complex activity, chromatophores or purified cytochrome bc1 complexes were diluted with 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, containing 200 mm NaCl and 0.01% dodecyl maltoside to a final concentration of cytochrome b of 3 μm. Appropriate amounts of the diluted samples were added to 1 ml of assay mixture containing 100 mm Na+/K+ phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, 300 μm EDTA, 100 μm cytochrome c, and 25 μm Q0C10BrH2. Activities were determined by measuring the reduction of cytochrome c (the increase of absorbance at 550 nm) in a Shimadzu UV 2101 PC spectrophotometer at 23 °C, using a millimolar extinction coefficient of 18.5 for calculation. The non-enzymatic oxidation of Q0C10BrH2, determined under the same conditions in the absence of enzyme, was subtracted from the assay. To measure the effect of oxygen on bc1 activity, a Thunberg cuvette was used. 1 ml of assay mixture was placed in the main chamber, and a 10-μl aliquot of enzyme (5–10 pmol) was in the side arm. The cuvette was evacuated and flushed with argon five times. The reaction was started by mixing the bc1 complex solution and the assay mixture. Measurement of Superoxide Anion Generation—Superoxide anion generation by the cytochrome bc1 complex was determined by measuring the chemiluminescence of MCLA-O2·¯ adduct (23Nakano M. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 186: 585-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), in an Applied Photophysics stopped-flow reaction analyzer SX.18MV (Leatherhead, England), by leaving the excitation light off and registering light emission (24Denicola A. Souza J.M. Gatti R.M. Augusto O. Radi R. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1995; 19: 11-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Reactions were carried out at 23 °C by mixing 1:1 solutions A and B. Solution A contains 100 mm Na+/K+ phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm KCN, 1 mm NaN3, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 0.01% dodecyl maltoside, and an appropriate amount of wild-type or mutant bc1 complex. Solution B was the same as A with bc1 complex being replaced with 50 μm Q0C10BrH2 and 4 μm MCLA. O2·¯ generation is expressed in xanthine oxidase (XO) units. One XO unit is defined as chemiluminescence (maximum peak height of light intensity) generated by 1 unit of XO, which equals 2.71 V from an Applied Photophysics stopped-flow reaction analyzer SX.18MV, when solution A containing 100 mm Na+/K+ phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, 100 μm hypoxanthine, 4 μm MCLA, and 1 mm NaN3 is mixed with solution B containing 100 mm Na+/K+ phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, 1 mm NaN3, and 1 unit of XO. Other Biochemical and Biophysical Techniques—Protein concentration was determined by the method of Lowry et al. (25Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cytochrome b (26Berden J.A. Slater E.C. Biochim. Biophys.

Acta. 1986; 852: 203-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) contents were determined according to reported methods. SDS-PAGE was performed according to Laemmli (28Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207218) Google Scholar) using a Bio-Rad Mini-Protean dual slab vertical cell. Samples were digested with 10 mm Tris-Cl buffer, pH 6.8, containing 1% SDS, and 3% glycerol in the presence of 0.4% β-mercaptoethanol for 2 h at 37 °C before being subjected to electrophoresis. EPR spectra of b cytochromes were recorded at 8.5 K on a Bruker EMX EPR spectrometer equipped with an Air Products flow cryostat. The instrument settings are detailed in the figure legend. Refined coordinates for the crystal structure of native bovine mitochondrial bc1 (29Gao X. Wen X. Yu C.A. Esser L. Tso S. Quinn B. Zhang L. Yu L. Xia D. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 11692-11702Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) (PDB code 1NTM) were used for distance determination. Involvement of the Phe-195 of Cytochrome b in Electron Transfer Activity of the Cytochrome bc1 Complex—Three aromatic amino acid residues in cytochrome b, Phe-195, Tyr-199, and Phe-203, were selected for mutation to test the hypothesis that inter-monomer bL-bL electron transfer occurs during bc1 catalysis, and such electron transfer is facilitated by aromatic residues located between the two bL hemes. Alignment of more than 40 sequences of cytochrome b reveals that Phe-195 is fully conserved except in Rhodopseudomonas virids (in which Phe is replaced by Tyr); Tyr-199 is highly conserved, although it is replaced by Phe in many cases; and Phe-203 is less conserved, being substituted with Met, Ser, Leu, and Trp in some species (30Esposti M.D. Vrits S.D. Crimi M. Gholli A. Patarnello T. Meyer A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1143: 243-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). The selection of these three residues was based on the three-dimensional structure of the four-subunit cytochrome bc1 complex of R. sphaeroides (Fig. 2A) constructed by using coordinates from bovine cytochromes b and c1, ISP, and subunit VII (31Tso S.-C. Shenoy S.K. Quinn B. Yu L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15287-15294Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The distances between the symmetry pairs of aromatic residues Phe-195, Tyr-199, or Phe-203 are 4.5, 7.7, and 6.8 Å (Fig. 2B), respectively, when measured from edge to edge of the phenyl rings of the amino acid residues. They are, edge to edge, 3.8, 3.7, and 3.3 Å apart, respectively, in the corresponding residues in the bovine complex (Phe-179, Phe-183, and Phe-187 in bovine). The distances from heme bL to Phe-195, Tyr-199, or Phe-203 are 8.8, 4.9, and 10.3 Å, respectively, when measured from the iron center to the edges of the aromatic ring of the amino acid residues. They are 7.5, 8.6, and 10.2 Å, respectively, in the corresponding bovine enzyme. Recently a relative low resolution structure of cytochrome bc1 complex from Rhodobacter capsulatus was reported (32Berry E.A. Huang L.S. Saechao L.K. Pon N.G. Valkova-Valchanova M. Daldal F. Photosynthesis Res. 2004; 81: 251-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). The distances obtained among these aromatic amino acids pairs are surprisingly closed to those deduced from the model of the complex of R. sphaeroides. When each of these three aromatic residues was replaced with alanine, the resulting mutants (F195A, Y199A, and F203A) grew photosynthetically at a rate comparable to that of the complement (wild-type) cells. Chromatophores prepared from these mutants have, respectively, 80, 100, and 100% of the bc1 activity found in the complement chromatophores (Table II). When cytochrome bc1 complexes prepared from these three mutant chromatophores were assayed for ubiquinol-cytochrome c reductase activity, the Y199A and F203A mutant complexes had the same activity as the complement complex, and the F195A mutant complex had about 78% (see Table II). These results indicate that Phe-195 of cytochrome b is involved in inter-monomer electron transfer in the dimeric bc1 complex, but residues Tyr-199 or Phe-203 are not.Table IICharacterization of mutants in the cytochrome b of the bc1 complexMutantsPhotosynthetic growthActivityChromatophorebc1 complexaThe purified bc1 complex was in 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, containing 200 mm NaCl, 200 mm histidine, and 0.5% octyl-glucoside.S.A.bSpecific activity (S.A.) is expressed as micromoles of cytochrome c reduced/min/nmol of cytochrome b at room temperature.Wild type+ +c+ +, cell growth rate is essentially the same as that of the wild-type cells.2.21 ± 0.032.50 ± 0.01F195A+ +1.76 ± 0.021.94 ± 0.02Y199A+ +2.21 ± 0.032.52 ± 0.03F203A+ +2.20 ± 0.032.51 ± 0.02F195Y+ +2.22 ± 0.032.50 ± 0.01F195W+ +2.20 ± 0.022.49 ± 0.03F195H+ +2.21 ± 0.012.50 ± 0.02F195A/Y199A+ +1.76 ± 0.021.95 ± 0.02F195A/F203A+ +1.78 ± 0.011.93 ± 0.03Y199A/F203A+ +2.20 ± 0.022.50 ± 0.02F195A/Y199A/F203A+ +1.77 ± 0.011.96 ± 0.02a The purified bc1 complex was in 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, containing 200 mm NaCl, 200 mm histidine, and 0.5% octyl-glucoside.b Specific activity (S.A.) is expressed as micromoles of cytochrome c reduced/min/nmol of cytochrome b at room temperature.c + +, cell growth rate is essentially the same as that of the wild-type cells. Open table in a new tab Mutants with double and triple alanine substitutions in these three aromatic residues of cytochrome b were also generated and characterized. These are: F195A/Y199A, F195A/F203A, Y199A/F203A, and F195A/Y199A/F203A. All but the Y199A/F203A mutant complex have about 78% of the activity found in the complement complex (see Table II). The Y199A/F203A has the same activity as that of the complement complex. Because the extent of bc1 activity decrease in the double or triple alanine substitution mutants containing the F195A mutation is the same as that observed for the F195A mutant complex, aromatic residues Tyr-199 and Phe-203 apparently play no complementary or auxiliary role to residue Phe-195 in inter-monomer electron transfer. Because the extent of activity change upon the replacement Phe-195 with alanine is a relatively small, 22% decrease, special attention was paid during data collection. The experiments were not only repeated by three times but also repeated by different investigators. We are very confident that the difference in activity is real and not an experimental artifact. In fact the small change in activity observed upon replacement of aromatic amino acid with an alanine at residue position 195 was expected, because the inter-monomer electron transfer is not in the main path of electron transfer. Absorption spectral analysis of mutant complexes of F195A, F195A/Y199A, F195A/F203A, and F195A/Y199A/F203A indicates that the amounts and absorption properties of cytochromes b and c1 in these mutant complexes are the same in the complement complex. Western blot analysis using antibodies against R. sphaeroides ISP and subunit IV also indicate that these mutant complexes have the same amount of ISP and subunit IV as does the complement complex. Thus the decrease in bc1 activity in the F195A mutant complex is not due to mutational effects on the assembly of the bc1 protein subunits into the chromatophore membrane or to changes in the binding affinity of protein subunits in the complex. Although the three pairs of aromatic residues are all located at the dimer interface of the cytochrome b subunits, they are not the only residues contributing to the stability of the dimer. As observed in the bovine complex, at least 23 residue pairs from a cytochrome b subunit make contact at the dimer interface, most are from the transmembrane helices of A and E, from the AB loop and from the N-terminal α helix. In addition, the ISP transmembrane helix and the head domain make substantial contributions to holding the dimer together. As the cytochrome b and ISP subunits are highly conserved, it is reasonable to believe that the interaction at the dimer interface would also be conserved. Because the structural effect of these mutations is probably a creation of small cavities, it is not surprising to find that even the triple mutation does not disturb the structural integrity of the bc1 dimer. In bovine cytochrome b the three interfacial aromatic pairs display three entirely different contact geometries: the Phe-179 pair (195 in R. sphaeroides bc1) has an on-edge interaction with the two phenyl rings aligned roughly parallel to the membrane plane; with an angle between the two planes of 37°; the phenyl rings of the Phe-183 pair (199 in R. sphaeroides bc1) are stacked on top of each other with an angle of 0°; and the Phe-187 pair (203 in R. sphaeroides bc1) is partially stacked, and these two phenyl rings are oriented normally to the membrane plane with an angle between the two rings of 34.7°. In biological electron transfer complexes such as the cytochrome bc1 complex (4Xia D. Yu C.A. Kim H. Xia J.Z. Kachurin A.M. Zhang L. Yu L. Deisenhofer J. Science. 1997; 277: 60-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (873) Google Scholar) and photosynthetic reaction centers (33Deisenhofer J. Michel H. Science. 1989; 245: 1463-1473Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar), donors and receptors of electron transfer machines are always observed in an on-edge arrangement, as determined by x-ray crystallography. Presumably the on-edge interaction between partners provides more efficient electron transfer than other orientations. The observed on"

Most surprisingly, GnT-V null MEF displayed increased expression levels of both α5 and β1 subunits in lysates and on the cell surface. Increased α5β1 expression in the null MEF was because of increased α5β1 transcript levels that declined after re-expression of GnT-V cDNA, confirming that increased α5β1 expression in null MEF was because of changes in GnT-V expression. The increased null MEF transcripts were shown to be caused at least in part by increased integrin promoter activity. Moreover, increased α5β1 integrin transcripts in GnT-V null MEF were not due to a differential response to fibronectin; rather, they appeared to be mediated by activation of a protein kinase C signaling pathway. These results demonstrate that deletion of MEF GnT-V resulted in enhanced integrin clustering and activation of α5β1 transcription by protein kinase C signaling, which in turn up-regulated levels of cell surface α5β1 fibronectin receptors that resulted in increased matrix adhesion and inhibition of migration.

The increase in GnT-V activity and its cell surface products during oncogenesis results from increased transcription driven by activation of the Ras-Ets and protein kinase B signaling pathways (4Ko J.H.

Studies have demonstrated the association of increased GnT-V activity and its glycan products with enhanced cell invasiveness and in some cases metastatic potential (7Demetriou M. Nabi I.R.

Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 6837-6845PubMed Google Scholar). Consequently, mice that lack GnT-V expression because of a targeted deletion (GnT-V or Mgat5(-/-)) have been used to study the effects of eliminating GnT-V activity on tumor progression (10Granovsky M. Fata J. Pawling J. Muller W.J. Khokha R. Dennis J.W. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 306-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). The progression of mammary tumors in GnT-V(-/-) mice that express the polyoma middle T oncoprotein antigen (PyMT) under control of the mouse mammary tumor virus promoter was significantly reduced when compared with mammary tumor progression in murine mammary tumor virus-PyMT/GnT-V(+/-) mice. Expression of GnT-V in the null background resulted in tumors that progressed at levels similar to those observed in the wild-type background (11Partridge E.A. Le Roy C. Di Guglielmo G.M. Pawling J. Cheung P. Granovsky M. Nabi I.R. Wrana J.L. Dennis J.W. Science. 2004; 306: 120-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar).Despite extensive studies implicating GnT-V activity and its products with tumorigenesis and increased metastatic potential, the exact mechanisms underlying these effects on cellular behaviors caused by GnT-V expression are only now becoming clearer. Studies have shown that GnT-V null mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEF) displayed altered focal adhesion formation compared with GnT-V wild-type MEF (10Granovsky M. Fata J. Pawling J. Muller W.J. Khokha R. Dennis J.W. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 306-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar), as well as increased cortical stress fibers, suggesting a more non-motile phenotype in GnT-V null MEF. Overexpression of GnT-V in several cell types (7Demetriou M. Nabi I.R. Coppolino M. Dedhar S. Dennis J.W. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 383-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar, 8Yamamoto H.

GnT-V overexpression clearly resulted in reduced α5β1-mediated adhesion to fibronectin and increased motility, likely due to inhibition of integrin clustering on the cell surface (9Guo H.B. Lee I. Kamar M. Akiyama S.K. Pierce M. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 6837-6845PubMed Google Scholar). Overexpression of GnT-III is known to decrease N-linked β (1Hakomori S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

J. 2000; 17: 315-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) branching due to competition with GnT-V for glycan substrates; consequently, increased GnT-III expression levels in several cell types have been shown to promote cell adhesion and inhibit migration, as well as to negatively influence tumor progression (12Yoshimura M.

Overexpression of GnT-V demonstrably inhibited cadherin-mediated cell association and the ERK and catenin intracellular signaling pathways regulated by cadherin (14Guo H.B. Lee I. Kamar M. Pierce M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 52412-52424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Again, evidence suggests that these effects resulted at least in part by cadherin clustering at the cell surface. As would be predicted, MEF from GnT-V null mice showed greatly enhanced cadherin-mediated adhesion compared with MEF from GnT-V(+/+) mice, and expression of GnT-V cDNA in the null MEF reversed cadherin-mediated adhesion to normal levels (14Guo H.B. Lee I. Kamar M. Pierce M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 52412-52424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar).In the present study, we focused on analyzing in detail the α5β1 integrin-mediated adhesion and migration of GnT-V null(-/-) and wild-type(+/+) MEF to elucidate further the cellular basis of decreased tumorigenesis and metastasis potential observed in the GnT-V null mice. We found that deletion of GnT-V resulted in increased fibronectin-induced MEF adhesion, spreading, tyrosine phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK), and reduced cell motility on fibronectin. These phenotypic defects were reversed by re-expression of GnT-V in the null MEF, confirming that they were due to altered N-linked glycosylation. Moreover, significantly increased mRNA, protein, and cell surface expression levels of both α5 and β1 integrin subunits were observed in GnT-V null MEF, which were reversed after re-expression of GnT-V cDNA. Increased transcription of α5β1 integrin in GnT-V null MEF was fibronectin-independent and mediated by activation of the PKC signaling pathway. These results demonstrate that deletion of GnT-V and subsequent aberrant N-glycosylation in MEF resulted in up-regulated levels of cell surface α5β1 fibronectin receptors, as well as their increased clustering, which consequently increased fibronectin-mediated cell-matrix adhesion and inhibited migration.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESAntibodies and Chemicals—Polyclonal antibody against FAK, α5 integrin, epidermal growth factor receptor, ERK1/2, monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine (PY20), HRP-labeled anti-rabbit IgG, and anti-mouse IgG2b were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology.

Insoluble debris was pelleted by microcentrifugation (10 min at 4 °C), and the supernatant was used for the GnT-V activity assay using UDP-[3H]-GlcNAc as donor substrate (15Shoreibah M.G. Hindsgaul O. Pierce M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2920-2927Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Sep-Pak columns (Waters) were used to separate the substrates and products. Assays were performed in duplicate; the data were averaged, and the results were expressed as specific activity (nmol/h/mg). Protein concentration in the cell lysates was determined using the BCA assay (Pierce).Assay of Cell Adhesion—Cell adhesion experiments were performed as described previously (9Guo H.B. Lee I. Kamar M. Akiyama S.K. Pierce M. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 6837-6845PubMed Google Scholar). In brief, 96-well microtiter plates were coated with 0.1 ml of different concentrations of fibronectin or laminin or collagen IV, incubated at 37 °C for 1 h, and blocked by 1% BSA at 37 °C for 0.5 h after washing. Cells (3 × 104) were added to each coated well and incubated for different times, as indicated, at 37 °C, followed by fixing with 3.5% formaldehyde and staining with crystal violet after two washings. The absorbance (A) of each well was measured at 595 nm. For the antibody inhibition experiments, 10 μg/ml of anti-CD29, anti-N-cadherin, or normal immune IgG (control IgG) was added to separate cell suspensions and incubated for 30 min at 4 °C and then 5 min at 37 °C, prior to addition of the cell suspension to the fibronectin-coated wells. The data were expressed as the mean of triplicate wells. For assessment of cell spreading on fibronectin, similar cell preparation protocols were used. After the adherent cells were fixed and stained with crystal violet, the number of spread cells was quantified by counting the percentage of spread cells versus the total number of cells counted. Cells were scored as spread if they became flattened and lost nuclear refractivity. Each experimental point was the result of counting cells in 3–5 fields/well in at least two wells viewed at ×100 magnification. The values from 6 to 10 fields were used to calculate the mean and standard error. Typically, 150–250 cells were present per field.In Vitro Cell Migration Assay—Migration assays were performed using 12-well transwell units with 8-μm pore size polycarbonate inserts (9Guo H.B. Lee I. Kamar M. Akiyama S.K. Pierce M. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 6837-6845PubMed Google Scholar). In brief, the undersides of insert membranes were coated with fibronectin at different concentrations, as indicated, overnight at 4 °C and then blocked with 1% BSA. Cells (3 × 104), suspended in 400 μl of DMEM, 0.1% BSA, were added into the upper compartment of the transwell unit, and 1.5 ml of DMEM, 0.1% BSA was also added into the lower compartment. For some experiments, 10 μg/ml anti-CD29 (integrin β1 chain) or normal immune IgG was added to the cell suspension before it was transferred to the transwell apparatus. Cells were allowed to migrate for 6 h at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. Cells on the upper side of the membrane were then removed, whereas the cells that migrated through the membrane to the underside were fixed and stained with crystal violet. Cell numbers were then counted in five separate fields using light microscopy at ×100 magnification. The data were expressed as the mean value of cells in five fields based on two independent experiments.For the scratch-wound healing assay, cells (1 × 105) were seeded on fibronectin-coated 4-well chamber slides in serum-free DMEM overnight, and then scratch-wounded with a 200-μl yellow plastic tip. After washing with serum-free DMEM, the chamber slide was incubated for 6 h at 37 °C in serum-containing media. Migration of cells into wounded areas was photographed, and then the cells were stained with rhodamine-phalloidin (1:40), as described below, followed by photography using an inverted fluorescence microscope.Fluorescence Staining of α5β1 Integrin—MEF were cultured on coverslips coated with fibronectin (10 μg/ml) for 1 h and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS. After blocking with 1% BSA, cells were stained with a mixture of rabbit polyclonal anti-α5 and mouse monoclonal anti-β1 integrin, followed by incubation with rhodamine-conjugated anti-rabbit or FITC-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (1:250). After washing with PBS, the coverslips were mounted, and the cells subjected to deconvolution fluorescence microscopy.Immunoblotting and Lectin Blotting—Cells were harvested and lysed in lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm PMSF, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin and leupeptin). Twenty μg of total cell lysates protein, determined using BCA protein assay procedure (Pierce), were boiled in 2× SDS sample buffer for 5 min, electrophoresed on a 4–20% polyacrylamide mini gel, and then transferred onto a PVDF membrane. After blocking with 3% BSA in PBS, the membrane was incubated for 2 h at room temperature with primary antibodies (1:1000) or biotinylated lectins (1:2500) in TBS buffer containing 0.05% Tween 20 (TBST). The membrane was then washed with TBS and probed with HRP-conjugated anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG (1:3000) or streptavidin (1:5000) for 1 h at room temperature. After the membrane was washed with TBS, protein bands were developed with ECL reagents and exposed on x-ray film. Images of immunoblots and lectin blots were quantified using a Fluor-S imager (Bio-Rad).Cell Surface Labeling and Immunoprecipitation—Subconfluent cells were washed and detached using 2 mm EDTA. Cells were then washed twice with ice-cold PBS and incubated with 1 mg/ml NHS-LC-biotin in PBS for 20 min at 4 °C on a rocking platform. After washing with PBS, cells were lysed by incubation with lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mM PMSF, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin and leupeptin) for 30 min at 4 °C. For immunoprecipitation of α5β1, cell lysates were cleared by centrifugation and incubated with protein G- or A-agarose at 4 °C under agitation for 1–2 h to remove nonspecific adsorption to the agarose beads. After the determination of total protein using the BCA assay, cell lysates (350 μg of protein) were incubated either with 2 μg of antibody against β1 integrin for 3 h at 4 °C under agitation, followed by incubation with protein G-plus agarose at 4 °C for 2 h under agitation, or with 50 μl of streptavidin-agarose. The pellets were washed twice in lysis buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions. The gels were then transferred onto a PVDF membrane and probed either with streptavidin-HRP (1:5000) for antibody precipitation or with antisera against α5β1 integrin in the case of streptavidin precipitation.For lectin precipitation of α5β1 integrin (16Salicioni A.M. Gaultier A. Brownlee C. Cheezum M.K. Gonias S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 10005-10012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), cell extracts were treated by boiling in 100 μl of denaturation buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% SDS, and 5 mm EDTA) for 5–10 min, followed by addition of 900 μl of lysis buffer containing protease inhibitors as mentioned above. Lysates were then incubated with each biotinylated lectin (5 μg) overnight at 4 °C under agitation, followed by incubation with streptavidin-agarose at 4 °C for 2 h under agitation. Particular N-glycans on α5β1 integrin were then detected using antibody against β1 after SDS-PAGE and membrane transfer, as described above.For immunoprecipitation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK), serum-starved cells were grown on fibronectin (10 μg/ml)-coated plates for 10 or 30 min. After washing with PBS, cells were lysed in ice-cold lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 20 mm pyrophosphate, 1% Triton X-100, 100 mm NaF, 2 mm Na3VO4, 0.2 mm ammonium molybdate, 2 mm PMSF, 0.7 μg/ml pepstatin, 20 μg/ml aprotinin and leupeptin) for 30 min and centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. Supernatants (350 μg of protein) were used for immunoprecipitation of FAK as described above. Immunocomplexes were then separated by reducing SDS-PAGE (7.5%), transferred onto a PVDF membrane, and probed with mouse anti-PY20 and antibody against FAK.Metabolic Labeling and Autoradiography—Radiolabeling was performed as described (16Salicioni A.M. Gaultier A. Brownlee C. Cheezum M.K. Gonias S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 10005-10012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Fibroblasts were grown to confluency on 60-mm culture dishes, rinsed twice with PBS, and preincubated for 30 min in Met/Cys-free DMEM (Invitrogen) containing 2% dialyzed FBS. Cells were then labeled with 100 μCi/ml 35S-labeled methionine/cysteine in 2 ml of the same growth media for 30 min and then chased for the indicated times. Labeled cells were harvested and lysed in ice-cold extraction buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 2% Triton X-100, 20 μg/ml leupeptin, 20 μg/ml pepstatin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 mm PMSF). Two hundred μg of protein was used for immunoprecipitation of α5β1 integrin using antisera against α5β1, as described above. The precipitates were then subjected to 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels under nonreducing conditions. After fixation and drying, β1 integrin was detected by autoradiography, and the results were analyzed by the Fluor-S imager (Bio-Rad). The very low intensity of α5 radiolabeled bands detected in these experiments precluded definitive analysis of its biosynthesis.Flow Cytometry Analysis—Cells were grown to subconfluence and detached with 2 mm EDTA in PBS. Cells (106) were washed, resuspended in 100 μl of FACS buffer (PBS containing 1% BSA and 0.01% sodium azide), and then incubated with antibody against α5β1 integrin (1:100) and biotinylated L-PHA (3 μg) at 4 °C for 30 min, followed by washing three times with FACS buffer. Cells were then labeled with FITC-conjugated secondary antibodies or FITC-streptavidin (10 μl) at 4 °C for 30 min. Analyses were then performed on FACScan (BD Biosciences).Quantitative Real Time RT-PCR Analysis—The RNeasy kit (Qiagen) was used to isolate total RNA. Reverse transcription reactions were performed using Superscript III (Stratagene) and random primers. Primers used in the quantitative real time RT-PCR analysis were as below: mouse α5 integrin forward, 5′-ATGGCTCAGACATCCACTCC-3′, and reverse, 5′-GGTCATCTAGCCCATCTCCA-3′; β1 integrin forward, 5′-GGTGTCGTGTTTGTGAATGC-3′, and reverse, 5′-TGACGCTAGACATGGACCAG-3′; and mouse glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase forward, 5′-TGCGACTTCAACAGCAACTC-3′, and reverse, 5′-ATGTAGGCCATGAGGTCCAC-3′. Real time reactions were performed using the iQTMSYBR Green Supermix (Bio-Rad) under the following conditions: 30 s at 95 °C for 1 cycle, 10 s at 95 °C, 30 s at 65 °C for 40 cycles; 95 °C for 1 min, 55 °C for 1 min, and 80 cycles of 55 °C for 10 s for melting curve analysis.Assay of Integrin mRNA Stability—MEF were spread onto 6-well plates and grown to subconfluence in DMEM containing 10% FBS. The medium was then replaced with DMEM containing 5% FBS and actinomycin D (10 μg/ml), an inhibitor of RNA transcription, and cells were collected at the indicated time points for total RNA isolation. Real time RT-PCR was performed using total RNA to detect mRNA levels. Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase was used as an internal control, and the results were plotted as the percent of RNA remaining versus the time after addition of actinomycin D.Plasmid Construction, Transient Transfection, and Luciferase Assay—The human integrin α5 promoter containing upstream regulatory sequences from positions -954 to +23 has been described (17Birkenmeier T.M. McQuillan J.J. Boedeker E.D. Argraves W.S. Ruoslahti E. Dean D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20544-20549Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and was obtained by PCR from a genomic template that was prepared from human MCF-7 cells. The primers designed for the amplification of the promoter sequence were as follows: forward, 5′-TGAGCCACCGTGCCTGGCCAGAGC-3′, and reverse, 5′-AGCGCCCGCTCTTCCCTGTCCTG-3′. The 977-bp PCR product was confirmed by sequencing and inserted into the KpnI and XhoI sites in the pGL3-basic luciferase reporter vector via a shuttle TOPO clonal vector, generating an integrin α5 promoter-controlled luciferase reporter construct pGL3/α5-954. MEF grown on 24-well plates were transiently co-transfected using Lipofectamine as suggested by the manufacturer. One μg of pGL3/α5-954 or pGL3-basic as control, along with 1 μg of pAC5/V5-His/LacZ, were added to 105 cells in each well, and the mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 4 h, followed by replacement with complete DMEM growth media. Twenty four h after transfection, cells were washed with cold PBS and harvested. The levels of luciferase activity for transfected cells were then determined by using a quantitative assay kit and luminometer detection. Results were expressed as relative luciferase units normalized for transfection efficiency using β-galactosidase activity.RESULTSCharacterization of GnT-V-deficient MEF—GnT-V-deficient MEF were isolated from E13.5 embryos that resulted from breeding of heterozygous GnT-V (GnT-V(+/-)) mice and were identified by PCR of genomic DNA, based on the expression of lacZ and GnT-V genes (14Guo H.B.

https://openalex.org/W2092509789,"Activation of protein kinase C (PKC) involves its recruitment to the membrane, where it interacts with its activator(s). We expressed PKCalpha fused to green fluorescent protein and examined its real time translocation to the plasma membrane in living human corneal epithelial cells. Upon 10 min of stimulation with epidermal and hepatocyte growth factors (EGF and HGF), PKCalpha translocated to the plasma membrane. Keratinocyte growth factor did not stimulate PKCalpha translocation up to 1 h after stimulation. Pretreatment with the 15-lipoxygenase metabolite, 15(S)-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (15(S)-HETE), followed by EGF or HGF, produced faster translocation of PKCalpha detectable at 2 min. However, the same concentration of 15(S)-HETE alone did not stimulate translocation. 15(S)-Hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acid and 5(S)-HETE did not affect growth factor-induced translocation of PKCalpha. PD153035, a specific inhibitor of tyrosine kinase activity of the EGF receptor, completely blocked PKCalpha translocation induced by EGF. PD98059, a specific MEK inhibitor, significantly inhibited EGF- and HGF-mediated PKCalpha translocation, which was reversed by addition of 15(S)-HETE. Phosphorylation of ERK1/2 by EGF was followed by phosphorylation of cytosolic phospholipase A(2) (cPLA(2)), and blocking ERK1/2 inhibited cPLA(2) activation. Immunofluorescence demonstrated translocation of p-cPLA(2) to plasma and nuclear membranes as early as 2 min. This may further increase arachidonic acid release from membrane phospholipid pools and increase the intracellular pool of HETEs. In fact, in cells prelabeled with [(3)H]arachidonic acid, EGF stimulated synthesis of 15(S)-HETE in the cytosolic fraction. 15(S)-HETE also reversed the effect of LOX inhibitor on EGF-mediated cell proliferation. Our results indicate that 15(S)-HETE is an intracellular second messenger that facilitates translocation of PKCalpha to the membrane and elucidate a mechanism that plays a regulatory role in cell proliferation crucial to corneal wound healing."
https://openalex.org/W2022433775,"There is substantial interest in the identification of circulating human tumor-derived proteins in serum for the purposes of early cancer diagnosis. We have implemented an approach based on the analysis of microarray data for the identification of tumor proteins that may have utility as biomarkers in colon cancer. Expression analysis of microarray data obtained from a variety of 283 tumors and normal tissues revealed that defensin α6 was maximally expressed in colon cancer. These findings were corroborated by reverse transcription-PCR, in which the colon cancer cell lines LoVo, Caco2, HCT-15, SW480, and SW620 showed significantly higher levels of defensin α6 expression than did non-colon cancer cell lines. Moreover, our data were concordant with data obtained from the NCI, National Institutes of Health Cancer Genome Anatomy Project. To evaluate defensin α6 as a potential biomarker of colon cancer, a preliminary “training” set of serum from 91 healthy donors and 109 colon cancer patients was analyzed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The data pattern was confirmed by an independent set of 67 masked serum samples: 18 from healthy donors and 49 from colon cancer patients. This result yielded a sensitivity of 69.4% (95% CI 54.6–81.8), specificity of 83.3% (58.6–96.4), and positive predictive value of 91.9% (78.1–98.3). These findings justify a prospective assessment of serum defensin α6 protein as a screening tool for colon cancer.

These findings justify a prospective assessment of serum defensin α6 protein as a screening tool for colon cancer. Colorectal cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death in the United States, with 135,000 new cases diagnosed each year and an overall 5-year survival rate of ∼50%. Most colorectal cancers develop slowly, beginning as small benign colorectal adenomas that progress over several decades to larger and more dysplastic lesions, eventually becoming malignant. This gradual progression provides ample opportunity for prevention and intervention. Diagnostic screening methods are at present suboptimal; therefore, new approaches are needed (1Inger D.B. Prim. Care. 1999; 26: 179-187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). In an effort to identify potential molecular markers of colorectal tumors, we have implemented an approach based on the analysis of microarray data for the identification of tumor proteins that may have utility as biomarkers in colon cancer. Expression analysis of microarray data obtained from a variety of 283 tumors and normal tissues revealed that defensin α6 was maximally expressed in colon cancer. Human defensins comprise a family of closely related, cationic polypeptides 29–42 amino acids in length. The peptides contain 6 conserved cysteines linked in disulfide bonds that stabilize the molecules as triple-stranded amphiphilic β-sheet structures (2Ganz T. Lehrer R.I. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1994; 6: 584-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar, 3Hill P.C. Yee J. Selsted M.E. Eisenberg D. Science. 1991; 251: 1481-1485Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). In vitro, human defensins exhibit antimicrobial activity against some bacteria, fungi, enveloped viruses, and parasites (4Ganz T. Weiss J. Semin. Hematol. 1997; 34: 343-354PubMed Google Scholar, 5Ganz T. Lehrer R.I. Pharmacol. Ther. 1995; 66: 191-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). Two classes of human defensins, termed “α-defensins” and “β-defensins,” have been identified that differ with respect to their localization and linkage of cysteine residues, precursor peptide structure, and pattern of tissue expression. Whereas β-defensins are most abundant in epithelial cells of the lung (6Bals R. Wang X. Wu Z. Freeman T. Bafna V. Zasloff M. Wilson J.M. J. Clin. Investig. 1998; 102: 874-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar, 7Zhao C.Q. Wang I. Lehrer R.I. FEBS Lett. 1996; 396: 319-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar), skin (8Fulton C.

Wiles K.R. McCray P.B. Ganz T. J. Clin.

Although defensins seem to have diverse functional activities in innate antimicrobial immunity, a few reports have also indicated the presence of several defensins in epithelial tumors (12Abiko Y. Mitamura J. Nishimura M. Muramatsu T. Inoue T. Shimono M. Kaku T. Cancer Lett. 1999; 143: 37-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 13Bateman A. Singh A. Jothy S. Fraser R. Esch F. Solomon S.

Anticancer Res. 2000; 20: 1125-1127PubMed Google Scholar). There is much interest in identification of circulating tumor-derived proteins that may serve as biomarkers for the early detection of colon cancer. We demonstrated that the defensin α6 protein is expressed at higher levels in serum from colon cancer patients relative to serum from non-cancer controls. As such, defensin α6 may have utility as a biomarker for colon cancer. Sera—Sera representing the predetermined training set were obtained at the time of diagnosis from 91 healthy individuals and 109 colon cancer patients following informed consent. For the independent test, 67 masked serum samples consisting of 18 from healthy donors and 49 from colon cancer patients were obtained in the same way. The experimental protocol was approved by The University of Michigan Institutional Review Board prior to serum collection. Cell Lines and Cell Culture—The LoVo, HCT116, SW480, and SW620 colon adenocarcinoma cell lines, the Hs1 testis cancer cell line, and the SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cell line were each cultured (5% CO2, 37 °C) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 units/ml), all purchased from Invitrogen. Microarray Analysis—Single isolates of tumor samples and cancer cells were homogenized in the presence of TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen), and total cellular RNA was purified according to the manufacturer's procedures. RNA samples were further purified using RNeasy spin columns (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). RNA quality was assessed by 1% agarose gel electrophoresis in the presence of ethidium bromide. Samples that did not reveal intact and approximately equal 18 and 28 S ribosomal bands were excluded from further study. This study used commercially available high density microarrays (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA) that produced gene expression levels on 7129 known genes and expressed sequence tags (HuGeneFL Array). Preparation of cRNA, hybridization, and scanning of the arrays were performed according to the manufacturer's protocols. Briefly, 5 μg of the total RNA was used to generate double-stranded cDNA by reverse transcription using a cDNA synthesis kit (Superscript Choice system; Invitrogen) that uses an oligo(dT)24 primer containing a T7 RNA polymerase promoter 3′ to the poly(T) (Genset, La Jolla, CA), followed by second-strand synthesis. Labeled cRNA was prepared from the double-stranded cDNA by in vitro transcription by T7 RNA polymerase in the presence of biotin-11-CTP and biotin-16-UTP (Enzo, Farmingdale, NY). The labeled cRNA was purified over RNeasy columns. 15 μg of cRNA was fragmented at 94 °C for 35 min in 40 mm Tris acetate, pH 8.1, 100 mm potassium acetate, and 30 mm magnesium acetate. The cRNA was then used to prepare 300 μl of hybridization mixture (100 mm MES, 1 mm NaCl, 20 mm EDTA, 0.01% Tween 20) containing 0.1 mg/ml herring sperm DNA (Promega, Madison, WI) and 500 μg/ml acetylated bovine serum albumin (Invitrogen). Before hybridization, the cocktails were heated to 94 °C for 5 min, equilibrated at 45 °C for 5 min, and then clarified by centrifugation (16,000 × g) at room temperature for 5 min. Aliquots of this hybridization mixture containing 10 μg of fragmented cRNA were hybridized to HuGeneFL arrays at 45 °C for 16 h in a rotisserie oven set at 60 rpm. The arrays were washed using nonstringent buffer (6× SSPE) (sodium chloride/sodium phosphate/EDTA) at 25 °C, followed by stringent buffer (100 mm MES, pH 6.7, 0.1 m NaCl, 0.01% Tween 20) at 50 °C. The arrays were stained with streptavidin-phycoerythrin (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR), washed with 6× SSPE buffer, incubated with biotinylated anti-streptavidin IgG, stained again with streptavidinphycoerythrin, and washed again with 6× SSPE. The arrays were scanned using the GeneArray scanner (Affymetrix). Image analysis was performed with GeneChip software (Affymetrix). Real-time Quantitative PCR—Total RNA was extracted from cells with TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen), following the protocol that was provided. For each sample, 2 μg of RNA were treated with DNase l (Roche Applied Science) at 37 °C for 30 min to remove contaminating DNA and then denatured in the presence of random hexamer primers (Promega). The samples were incubated with Superscript II (Invitrogen) reverse transcriptase in the presence of 1.0 mm dithiothreitol and 1.0 mm each of dTTP, dGTP, dCTP, and cATP at 42 °C for 40 min. The resulting cDNA was treated with RNase H (Roche Applied Science) and subjected to PCR amplification. We relied on the TaqMan assay (PerkinElmer model 7700) to quantitate the amount of defensin α6 mRNA. The forward and reverse primers and the FAM-tagged probe used for the defensin α6 gene in the assay were 5′-CAAGGCTGAGCCACTCCAA, 5′-CCTGGGCATCAGCCTCATA, 5′-6FAM-CTGAGGATGATCCACTGCAGGCAAAAG CTTTTGCCTGCAGTGGATCATCCTCAG-TAMRA, respectively. The forward and reverse primers and FAM-tagged probe used for the β-actin gene were 5′-AACTTGAGATGTATGAAGGCTTTTGG, 5′-TTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTAAG, and 5′-6FAM-CAACTGGTCTCAAGTCAGTGTACAGGTAAGCCCT-TAMRA, respectively. To assay the initial concentration of the reactants (the sequence abundance), the number of cycles at which the reaction crosses a threshold value was measured. This number varies directly with the initial sequence abundance. To measure the relative abundance of the defensin α6 gene in any given RNA sample, the amplification value derived using the defensin α6 sequence was divided by the amplification value using the β-actin sequence. Derivation of this fraction is independent of RNA sample concentration. Two-dimensional Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis—Cultured cells were solubilized in lysis buffer containing 9.5 m urea (Bio-Rad), 2% Nonidet P-40, 2% carrier ampholytes (pH 4–8; Gallard/Schlessinger, Carle Place, NY), 2% β-mercaptoethanol, and 10 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Protein concentrations were measured by the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). Proteins (175 μg) were applied to isoelectric focusing gels. Isoelectric focusing was conducted with pH 4–8 carrier ampholytes at 700 V for 16 h, followed by 1000 V for an additional 2 h. The first-dimension gel was loaded on the second-dimension gel after equilibration in second-dimension sample buffer (125 mm Tris (pH 6.8) containing 10% glycerol, 2% SDS, 1% dithiothreitol, and bromphenol blue). For the second-dimension separation, a gradient of 11–14% acrylamide (Serva/Crescent Chemical, Hauppauge, NY) was used. Proteins were transferred to an Immobilon-P polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA) or visualized by silver staining of the gels. Western Blotting—After transfer, membranes were incubated for 2 h in blocking buffer containing 5% milk in 10 mm Tris-HCI (pH 7.5), 2.5 mm EDTA (pH 8), 50 mm NaCl. The membranes were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with defensin α6 antibody at a 1:1000 dilution. The membranes were then incubated for 1 h with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit (Amersham Biosciences) IgG antibodies at a dilution of 1:1000. Immunodetection was accomplished by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences) followed by autoradiography on hyperfilm MP (Amersham Biosciences). Patterns visualized after hybridization following revelation with patients' sera were compared directly with Coomassie blue-stained blots from the same sample to determine correlations with proteins. Immunofluorescence Microscopy—The cancer cells were grown in 2-well chamber slides for 48 h and then fixed in 2% formaldehyde, freshly prepared from paraformaldehyde. The fixed cells were washed briefly in Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (D-PBS). 1The abbreviations used are: D-PBS, Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline; MES, 2-morpholinoethanesulfonic acid; BSA, bovine serum albumin: CEA, carcinoembryonic antigen. Aldehyde groups resulting from fixation were quenched in 50 mm l-lysine (in D-PBS), after which the fixed monolayers were washed three times in D-PBS (containing 1 mg/ml BSA). Each chamber was incubated with 0.5 ml of the defensin α6 antibody diluted as indicated in D-PBS (containing 2 mg/ml BSA) for 1 h at room temperature. The cells were washed in D-PBS (containing 2 mg/ml BSA), after which they were incubated in 0.5 ml of D-PBS (containing 2 mg/ml BSA) containing 10 μg/ml highly cross-adsorbed Alexa-594-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG. The stained monolayers were washed three times in D-PBS (containing 1 mg/ml BSA) and three times in D-PBS, after which a glass coverslip was mounted on the monolayers in GEL/MOUNT (Biomeda Corp., Foster City, CA). Fluorescence images were visualized through a Zeiss 510LSM confocal laser scanning microscope. Competitive Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay—A 96-well maxisorp microtiter plate (Nunc) was coated by incubation overnight at 4 °C with purified defensin α6 (10 μg/ml) in 0.1 m carbonate buffer, pH 9.6. After washing in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.4), any remaining protein binding sites in the microtiter plate were blocked by incubation with PBS/2% BSA overnight at 4 °C. Equal volumes of defensin antibody and serum competitor were mixed. The aliquots (100 μl) were added to the wells, in duplicate, after which the plate was incubated for 2 h at room temperature. After washing three times in PBS/2% BSA, 100 μl of horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (1: 1000 dilution) was added to each well and then incubated at room temperature for 1 h. After washing, bound peroxidase was determined using 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzide as the substrate. The color reaction was developed for 30 min, stopped by the addition of 50 μl of 1 m HCl to each well, and then read at 450 nm using a microtiter plate reader. Statistical Analysis—Serum levels of defensin α6 above 30 ng/ml were considered to be positive. Data were exported from a Microsoft Access data base, formatted, and then loaded into SAS 8.1v for analysis. An independent set of 67 serum samples had 95% power at the a = 0.05 level to reject an 80% sensitivity or specificity in favor of a true value of 95%, using an exact test for single proportions, with cutoff points for rejection based on the cumulative binomial distribution. Pearson's chisquare analysis was used to test the significance of the classification of colorectal cancer versus normal. Expression of Defensin α6 mRNA Encoding Defensin α6 in Colon Cancer—We profiled the gene expression of 283 tumors and normal tissue, consisting of 6 normal brain, 73 brain tumors, 51 colon adenocarcinomas, 10 normal lung, 57 lung adenocarcinomas, 7 normal pancreas, 8 pancreatic adenocarcinomas, 63 ovarian cancers, and 8 cardia carcinoma by microarrays. To determine which genes were only expressed at high levels in colon cancer, we compared gene expression profiles from colon cancer to those from the other tissues analyzed. We found that defensin α6 expression was ∼5-fold higher in colon cancer than in any other tissue type analyzed (Fig. 1). Our microarray data were confirmed by NCI, National Institutes of Health Cancer Genome Anatomy Project data (cgap.nci.nih.gov/Tissues/VirtualNorthern) (Fig. 2). According to the SAGE data, defensin α6 is expressed at a frequency of 0/98089 in normal colon tissue and 23/325836 in colon cancer (p = 0.01). Interestingly, defensin α6 was not expressed in any other tissues except in the gastrointestinal tract (i.e. stomach and colon), thus validating the specificity of defensin α6 in colon cancers.Fig. 2Virtual Northern of defensin α6. Spot images represent expression levels of the defensin α6 gene. For each combination of tissue and histology, expression is computed by dividing the number of expressed sequence tags (ESTs) or serial analysis of gene expression (SAGE) tags representing the gene divided by the total number of ESTs or SAGE tags in all libraries with the given tissue/histology. This ratio is then multiplied by 200,000, giving the number of ESTs or SAGE tags/200,000. This number is then placed on a logarithmic scale. Refer to cgap.nci.nih.gov/Tissues/VirtualNorthern.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) In addition to expression in tissues, expression of defensin α6 mRNA was confirmed in colon cancer cells by real-time PCR (Fig. 3). Defensin α6 was expressed in all colon adenocarcinoma cells examined (LoVo, HCT15, SW480, SW620), but not in the Hs1 testicular carcinoma or the SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cell lines. Expression of Defensin α6 Protein in Colon Cancer Tissue and Cells—We sought defensin α6 protein expression in colon cancer tissues and cells using two-dimensional Western blot. Colon cancer tissue or cells lysate was run in two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and stained in modified silver solutions. The gels were blotted on nitrocellulose membrane and hybridized by defensin α6 antibody. The equivalent spots to expected pI and molecular mass (5.2 and 10,975 Da) were observed in colon cancer tissue, LoVo, SW480, SW620, and HCT 15 cell blots (Fig. 4). We have confirmed the expression of defensin α6 protein in morphological examination. We examined whether this protein could be localized in colon cancer tissues and cells. Analysis of defensin α6 protein showed it to be in 11 of 36 colon tumors. Defensin α6 protein was also expressed in SW480 colon cancer cells by immunofluorescence microscopy (Fig. 5). Immunoprecipitation experiments showed that defensin α6 protein was expressed in LoVo and SW480 colon cancer cells (data not shown). Defensin α6 Protein Expression in Colon Cancer Patient Serum—We have analyzed the level of serum defensin α6 protein from normal controls and colon cancer patients using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Serum levels of defensin α6 above 30 ng/ml were considered to be positive. After a preliminary training set of serum from 91 healthy donors and 109 colon cancer patients was analyzed, an independent set of 67 masked serum samples consisting of 18 from healthy donors and 49 from colon cancer patients was measured (Table I. This result yielded a sensitivity of 69.4% (95% CI 54.6–81.8), specificity of 83.3% (58.6–96.4), and positive predictive value of 91.9% (78.1–98.3). These findings justify a prospective assessment of serum defensin α6 protein as a screening tool for colon cancer.Table IClassification of serum samples from masked validation set by defensin α6 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assayClassification by defensin α6 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assayNegativePositiveTotalNormal15318Colon cancer153449Total303767 Open table in a new tab Defensins belong to an expanding group of antimicrobial peptide families. Members of several of these families have been identified in vertebrate gastrointestinal and respiratory systems (4Ganz T. Weiss J. Semin. Hematol. 1997; 34: 343-354PubMed Google Scholar, 5Ganz T. Lehrer R.I. Pharmacol. Ther. 1995; 66: 191-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). The finding of antimicrobial peptides associated with non-hematopoietic tissues alludes to a widespread mechanism of peptide-based mucosal defense. The detection of defensin α6 in human cancer cells indicates that these epithelial cells play a key role in host defense of the bowel. In fact, our data show that human serum level for defensin α6 is high in colon cancer patients. There are several explanations for a possible influence of the circulating levels of defensin α6 on cancer growth. For instance, circulating levels may be influenced by cancer growth as a result of altered expression of defensin α6 in cancer tissues. As the cytotoxic activity of the α-defensins was noted (15Kagan B.L. Ganz T. Lehrer R.I. Toxicology. 1994; 87: 131-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar), the protection mechanism would be increased with the cancer growth. Indeed, defensin α1, α2, and α3 expression were increased in renal cell carcinoma with a possible direct influence on tumor proliferation (16Muller C.A. Markovic-Lipkovski J. Klatt T. Gamper J. Schwarz G. Beck H. Deeg M. Kalbacher H. Widmann S. Wessels J.T. Becker V. Muller G.A. Flad T. Am. J. Pathol. 2002; 160: 1311-1324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Interestingly, cytolytic effects in tissues were occasionally correlated with the presence of the α defensins in the study. In particular, groups of tumor cells in the center of primarily extended defensin patches tended to exhibit morphological signs of necrosis. By contrast, mitogenic effects of defensins have been described previously on mouse fibroblasts and epithelial cells (17Murphy C.J. Foster B.A. Mannis M.J. Selsted M.E. Reid T.W. J. Cell. Physiol. 1993; 155: 408-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Thus, it is indeed plausible that α defensins could contribute to cancer cell selection by promoting proliferation of a subset of malignant cells. At present it is unknown whether such selection mechanisms could favor colon cancer cell subpopulations that produce α defensins. Considering the existing literature together with the data presented in this study, it is interesting to speculate that defensin α6 may contribute to host anti-tumor immunity or otherwise function as a tumor suppressor. Screening based on a simple blood test that measures the concentrations of tumor-specific antigens would be far more likely than current diagnostic methods to gain general acceptance among patients and cancer specialists. The most widely used tumor marker for colon cancer is carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), which is a glycoprotein (18Thompson J.A. Grunert F. Zimmermann W. J. Clin. Lab. Anal. 1991; 5: 344-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar). However, the clinical applications of CEA have been limited to the detection of recurrence after colorectal surgery. Because CEA is significantly less sensitive for earlier stage disease, it was abandoned as a screening marker for early cancer. Therefore, researchers are continually trying to develop new tumor markers with better diagnostic capabilities than CEA that provide a simple and accurate test for early detection. The sensitivity and specificity for the masked validation set for defensin α6 was 69 and 83%, respectively. This result can be directly compared with a value of 40–45% and 88–90% for CEA, respectively (19Berglund A. Molin D. Larsson A. Einarsson R. Glimelius B. Ann. Oncol. 2002; 13: 1430-1437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 20Carpelan-Holmstrom M. Haglund C. Kuusela P. Jarvinen H. Roberts P.J. Br. J.

Cancer. 2002; 101: 545-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). A sensitivity of 69% might be acceptable for high risk population screening. After proper validation, serum levels of defensin α6 might ultimately be applied in medical screening clinics as a diagnostic assessment. An important goal is confirmation of sensitivity and specificity for the prospective detection of colon cancer in trials of high and low risk populations. In conclusion, defensin α6 mRNA was maximally expressed in colon cancer. Colon cancer cell lines showed significantly higher levels of defensin α6 expression than did non-colon cancer cell lines. The levels of defensin α6 in the serum of colon cancer patients were significantly higher than those found in normal subjects. Therefore, defensin α6 may have utility in colon cancer screening and diagnosis. Larger scale studies to establish the potential of these finding should be in progress."
https://openalex.org/W2037273428,"Two highly conserved eukaryotic gene products of unknown function showing homology to glycosyltransferases involved in the second steps of bacterial peptidoglycan (Murg) and capsular polysaccharide (Cps14f/Cps14g) biosynthesis have been identified in silico. The amino acid sequence of the eukaryotic protein that is homologous to the lipid acceptor- and membrane-associating N-terminal domain of Murg and the Cps14f β4-galactosyltransferase enhancer protein is predicted to possess a cleavable signal peptide and transmembrane helices. The other eukaryotic protein is predicted to possess neither transmembrane regions nor a signal peptide but is homologous to the UDP-sugar binding C-terminal domain of Murg and the Cps14g β4-galactosyltransferase. Both the eukaryotic proteins are encoded by essential genes in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and down-regulation of either causes growth retardation, reduced N-glycosylation of carboxypeptidase Y, and accumulation of dolichyl-PP-GlcNAc. In vitro studies demonstrate that these proteins are required for transfer of [3H]GlcNAc from UDP-[3H]GlcNAc onto dolichyl-PP-GlcNAc. To conclude, two gene products showing homology to bacterial glycosyltransferases are required for the second step in dolichyl-PP-oligosaccharide biosynthesis."

These data suggest that MUC8 may be one of important mucin genes expressed in human airway. However, the mechanisms of various inflammatory mediator-induced MUC8 gene expression in normal nasal epithelial cells remain unclear. We examined the mechanism by which prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), an arachidonic acid metabolite, increases MUC8 gene expression levels. Here, we show that ERK mitogen-activated protein kinase is essential for PGE2-induced MUC8 gene expression in normal human nasal epithelial cells and that p90 ribosomal S 6 protein kinase 1 (RSK1) mediates the PGE2-induced phosphorylation of cAMP-response element binding protein. Our results also indicate that cAMP-response element at the –803 region of the MUC8 promoter is an important site of PGE2-induced MUC8 gene expression.

In conclusion, this study gives insights into the molecular mechanism of PGE2-induced MUC8 gene expression in human airway epithelial cells. Mechanicochemical proteins produced by airway epithelial cells are essential components of airway mucus, which plays an important role in the protection of the airways from bacterial and viral attack. Mucins are highly glycosylated, high molecular weight glycoproteins and major components of the mucus produced by respiratory tract epithelia. In the airway, virtually all forms of airway inflammation are associated with the overproduction of mucus, which can lead to airway obstruction (1Basbaum C. Lemjabbar H. Longphre M. Li D. Gensch E. McNamara N. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 1999; 160: S44-S48Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar).Twenty mucin genes have been identified; however, it is not known which mucins are secreted in the various airway diseases. Thus, in terms of treatment for mucin hypersecretion, it is crucial that we identify the genes responsible for high viscosity mucus in airway diseases and develop means of reducing mucin production. The mucins are usually subdivided into two groups based on domain, namely, the membrane-bound and secreted mucins. Specifically, MUC2 (2Gum Jr., J.R. Hicks J.W. Toribara N.W. Siddiki B. Kim Y.S. J.

However, because only short partial sequences of the MUC8 gene have been reported, molecular studies have been limited. In a previous study, we completely sequenced MUC8 cDNA (GenBank™ accession number BK005559) and found that MUC8 protein contains secreted and membrane-bound mucin domains using the SMART program. 1K.

Because mucin hypersecretion is a hallmark of airway inflammation, it is important that we determine how PGE2 regulates airway mucin gene expression.In the present study, we examined the mechanism by which PGE2 increases MUC8 gene expression levels. We found that extracellular signal-regulated kinase mitogen-activated protein kinase (ERK MAPK) is essential for PGE2-induced MUC8 gene expression in normal human nasal epithelial (NHNE) cells. We also found that p90 ribosomal S 6 protein kinase 1 (RSK1) mediates the PGE2-induced phosphorylation of cAMP response element binding protein (CREB). In addition, transcriptional activities of cloned MUC8 promoter regions showed that CRE in MUC8 promoter is an important site of PGE2-induced MUC8 gene expression. Taken together, these studies provide insights into the mechanism of PGE2-induced MUC8 gene expression and extend our understanding of mucin gene overexpression during airway mucosal inflammation.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Cultures—Epithelia were isolated by scrapings from the inferior turbinate of healthy adult volunteers. None of volunteers had any history of allergic symptoms, nasal polyps, or asthma. They did not have a history of smoking and did not take any medicines for the past 6 months. The volunteers' permission and the approval from the Institutional Review Board at Yonsei University College of Medicine were obtained for the use of the specimens. The epithelial cells from the turbinates were treated with 1% Pronase (Type XIV protease, Sigma-Aldrich Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO) for 18 to 20 h at 4 °C. To remove fibroblasts, endothelial cells, and myoepithelial cells, isolated cells were placed in a plastic dish and cultured for 1 h at 37 °C. Isolated epithelial clusters were divided into single cells by incubating them with 0.25% trypsin/EDTA. Passage-2, NHNE cells were seeded in 0.5 ml of culture medium onto 24.5-mm, 0.45-μm pore size Transwell clear (Costar) culture inserts. Cells were cultured in a 1:1 mixture of bronchial epithelial cell growth medium (Clonetics):Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) containing all supplements described previously (24Yoon J.H.

Plasmid encoding kinase-deficient MEK1 mutant (pcDNA5-MEK1DN) was kindly provided by Dr. Jian-Dong Li (House Ear Institute, Los Angeles, CA).Real-time Quantitative PCR—Primers and probes were designed using PerkinElmer Life Sciences Primer Express® software purchased from PE Biosystems. Commercial reagents (TaqMan PCR Universal PCR master mix, PE Biosystems) and conditions were applied according to the manufacturer's protocol. 1 μg of cDNA (reverse transcription mixture), oligonucleotides at a final concentration of 800 nm of primers, and 200 nm TaqMan hybridization probe were used in a 25-μl volume. The probe of real-time PCR was labeled with carboxylfluorescein at the 5′-end and with the quencher carboxytetramethylrhodamine at the 3′-end. The following primers and TaqMan probes were used: MUC8, forward (5′-TAACCCAATGCCACTCCTTC-3′) and reverse (5′-GGAGTGTAACCTGGCTGCTC-3′) and TaqMan probe (carboxylfluorescein-GGTTAGGGCTGACCACAGAA-carboxytetramethylrhodamine). β 2-Microglobulin, forward (5′-CGCTCCGTGGCCTTAGC-3′) and reverse (5′-GAGTACGCTGGATAGCCTCCA-3′) and TaqMan probe (carboxylfluorescein-TGCTCGCGCTACTCTCTCTTTCTGGC-carboxytetramethylrhodamine). Real-time reverse transcription-PCR was performed on a PE Biosystems ABI PRISM® 7700 sequence detection system (Foster City, CA). The thermocycler parameters were 50 °C for 2 min and 95 °C for 10 min followed by 40 cycles of 95 °C for 15 s and 60 °C for 1 min. All reaction was performed in triplicate. Relative quantity of MUC8 mRNA was obtained using a comparative threshold method, and results were normalized against β 2-microglobulin as an endogenous control. Data were analyzed using Student's t test for paired and unpaired values for statistical analysis.Western Blot Analyses—NCI-H292 cells were grown to confluence in 6-well plates. After treating with 10 nm PGE2, cells were lysed with 2× Lysis buffer (250 nm Tris-Cl (pH 6.5), 2% SDS, 4% β-mercaptoethanol, 0.02% bromphenol blue, and 10% glycerol). Equal amounts of whole cell lysates were resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE and then transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore). Membranes were blocked with 5% skimmed milk in Tris-buffered saline (TBS, 50 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.5) and 150 mm NaCl) for 2 h at room temperature. Blots were then incubated overnight with primary antibodies in TTBS (0.5% Tween 20 in TBS). After washing with TTBS, the blots were further incubated for 1 h at room temperature with anti-rabbit or anti-mouse antibody (Cell Signaling) in TTBS and then visualized by ECL (Amersham Biosciences).Electromobility Shift Analysis—PGE2-treated NCI-H292 cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and pelleted. Pellets were resuspended in cell homogenization buffer (10 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonylfluoride), incubated for 10 min on ice, and centrifuged. Cells were then resuspended in cell homogenization buffer containing 0.05% (V/V) Nonidet P-40 and then homogenized. Nuclei were the pelleted and resuspended in cell resuspension buffer (40 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 0.4 m KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10% (V/V) glycerol, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonylfluoride, 0.1% (W/V) aprotinin, and 0.3 m NaCl). This nuclear extract was then centrifuged at 24,000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was aliquoted and stored at –70 °C. For electromobility shift assay, oligonucleotides corresponding to the consensus CRE sequence (5′-AGAGATTGCCTGACGTCAGAGAGCTAG-3′) and the MUC8 CRE sequence (5′-AACAGATAACAACTGACGCACTTCCGCCCG-3′) were synthesized, annealed, and end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP using T4-polynucleotidekinase (Promega). Nuclear extract was incubated at room temperature for 30 min with the 32P-labeled CRE probes in binding buffer (Promega). Oligo-nuclear protein complexes were separated from the probes by electrophoresis through 6% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel in 0.5× Tris borate-EDTA (TBE) buffer. Supershift experiment was conducted using 2 μlof anti-phospho-CREB antibody (Cell Signaling). The gel was dried and autoradiographed on a PhosphorImager.Transient Transfection and Luciferase Analysis—The constructs of deleted promoter and point-mutated CRE site of MUC8 gene were reported in our previous study.1 NCI-H292 cells were transiently transfected with pGL3-basic, pGL3-MUC8 (–1644/+ 87), pGL3-MUC8 (–1190/+ 87), pGL3-MUC8 (–973/+ 87), pGL3-MUC8 (–549/+ 87), pGL3-MUC8 CREM1, and pGL3-MUC8 CREM2 constructs using a FuGENE6 Transfection Reagent (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instructions, incubated for 48 h, treated with 10 nm of PGE2 for 24 h, harvested, and assayed for luciferase activity using a luciferase assay system (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. β-Galactosidase activity was also assayed to standardize sample transfection efficiencies. To confirm that the luciferase activity of each construct was from PGE2, we assayed the activity of each construct in the absence of PGE2.RESULTSPGE2 Can Induce MUC8 Gene Expression—To determine whether PGE2 can induce MUC8 gene expression within NHNE cells, we carried out reverse transcription-PCR after treating cells with various concentrations of PGE2. As the dose of PGE2 was increased from 1 to 1000 nm, MUC8 gene expression was observed to gradually increase from 10 nm. As shown in Fig. 1A, 10 nm PGE2 significantly induced MUC8 gene expression. However, no corresponding change was found in the expression of the internal control, β 2-microglobulin. To determine whether PGE2 induced MUC8 gene expression in a time-dependent manner, we examined MUC8 expression after various exposures to 10 nm PGE2 (Fig. 1B). MUC8 gene expression was found to be significantly increased after 24 h of exposure to PGE2. These results show that MUC8 gene expression was significantly elevated by PGE2 treatment in NHNE cells. Ten nm PGE2 was used in subsequent experiments.PGE2 Induces MUC8 Gene Expression via ERK MAP Kinase Signaling—To investigate which MAP kinase signal pathway is activated in NHNE cells stimulated by PGE2, we performed Western blot analysis using phosphospecific antibodies. ERK MAP kinase was maximally activated at 5 min, and this effect decreased after 20 min (Fig. 2A). However, no change was detected in the activations of phospho-p38 and c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase. IL-1β-treated NCI-H292 cells (25Kim Y.D. Kwon E.J. Park D.W. Song S.Y. Yoon S.K. Baek S.H. Mol. Pharmacol. 2002; 62: 1112-1118Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) and A549 cells (26Roberts M.L. Cowsert L.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 251: 166-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) were used as positive controls for p38 and c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase activation, respectively. Thus, it appeared that stimulation by PGE2 activates the ERK MAP kinase pathway in NHNE cells. Because PGE2 significantly increased both MUC8 gene expression and ERK MAP kinase activity, we investigated whether PGE2-induced MUC8 gene expression involves the ERK MAP kinase pathway. As a next step, 20 μm PD98059, specific MAPK/ERK kinase 1/2 inhibitor, was applied before PGE2 treatment. The pretreatment of NHNE cells with PD98059 for 1 h clearly inhibited ERK MAP kinase and significantly suppressed PGE2-induced MUC8 gene expression in NHNE cells (Fig. 2B). When the same experiments (Fig. 1 and Fig. 2, A and B) were performed using NCI-H292 cells (a human lung mucoepidermoid carcinoma cell line), the results obtained were the same as for NHNE cells (data not shown). To further confirm that ERK MAP kinase is involved in PGE2-induced MUC8 gene expression, cells were transiently transfected with a DNA construct encoding MEK1 dominant negative (pcDNA5-MEK1DN), and the overexpression of MEK1 DN was found to suppress PGE2-induced ERK MAP kinase activity. Moreover, PGE2-induced MUC8 gene expression was significantly and consistently suppressed by MEK1 DN (Fig. 2C). These results show that the activation of ERK MAP kinase via MEK1 is essential for PGE2-induced MUC8 gene expression in NCI-H292 cells.Fig. 2PGE2 induces MUC8 gene expression via ERK MAP kinase signaling. Confluent cells were treated with PGE2 (10 nm) for 5, 10, 20, 30, and 60 min, and cell lysates were harvested for Western blot analysis. Representative Western blots using phosphospecific antibodies showed transient activation of ERK but not p38 and c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase, and the maximum effect is at 5 min (A). Confluent cells were pretreated for 1 h with 20 μm PD98059 and then stimulated for 24 h with PGE2 prior to collection of total RNA for real-time quantitative PCR. Pretreated cells were stimulated for 5 min with PGE2 prior to collection of cell lysates for Western blot analysis (B). The cells were transiently transfected with MEK1-dominant negative (MEK1-DN) construct and stimulated with PGE2 for 24 h prior to real-time quantitative PCR. The figures shown are representative of three independent experiments. Transfected cells were stimulated with PGE2 for 5 min prior to Western blot analysis (C).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Effect of RSK1 on PGE2-induced MUC8 Gene Expression— To identify the molecules involved in the downstream signaling of ERK MAP kinase in PGE2-induced MUC8 gene expression, we investigated RSK1 and MSK1. RSK1 has been reported to be activated by ERK MAP kinase in IL-1β-induced MUC8 gene expression (27Song K.S. Seong J.K. Chung K.C. Lee W.J. Kim C.H. Cho K.N. Kang C.D. Koo J.S. Yoon J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 34890-34896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In this study, the overexpression of MEK1 DN was found to suppress PGE2-induced RSK1 activity (Fig. 2C). This result shows that PGE2-induced RSK1 activation is via MEK1/ERK MAP kinase. And in NHNE cells, MSK1 was found to be activated by ERK MAP kinase in IL-1β-induced MUC5AC gene expression (28Song K.S. Lee W.J. Chung K.C. Koo J.S. Yang E.J. Choi J.Y. Yoon J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 23243-23250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). However, MSK1 did not affect PGE2-induced MUC8 gene expression (data not shown). The phosphorylation of RSK1 by PGE2 peaked at 5 min and then decreased at 20 min (Fig. 3A). To determine whether RSK1 plays an important role in PGE2-induced MUC8 gene expression, we performed an RSK1 mutant study; RSK1 is a candidate mediator of cytokine-induced CREB phosphorylation at Ser-133. Overexpression of RSK1 DN (D205N, a dominant negative construct encoding RSK1 protein with an Asp-205 phosphorylation site mutated to Asn-205) suppressed PGE2-induced CREB and RSK1 phosphorylation (Fig. 3B), and PGE2-induced MUC8 gene expression was significantly suppressed by RSK1 DN. These results show that RSK1 is required for PGE2-induced MUC8 gene expression.Fig. 3Effect of RSK1 on PGE2-induced MUC8 gene expression. Confluent cells were stimulated for the indicated times with PGE2, and then total proteins were collected for Western blot (A). The cells were transiently transfected with RSK1-dominant negative (RSK1-DN) construct and stimulated with PGE2 for 24 h prior to real-time quantitative PCR. The figures shown are representative of three independent experiments. Transfected cells were stimulated with PGE2 for 10 min prior to Western blot analysis (B).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Effect of CREB on PGE2-induced MUC8 Gene Expression— To determine whether CREB plays a role in MUC8 gene expression, we performed Western blot analysis using anti phospho-CREB antibody. The phosphorylation of CREB by PGE2 peaked at 10 min and then decreased at 60 min (Fig. 4A). Furthermore, PGE2-induced MUC8 gene expression was significantly suppressed in cells transfected with plasmid encoding CREB DN (S133A, a dominant negative construct encoding CREB protein with its Ser-133 phosphorylation site mutated to Ala-133 (Fig. 4B). These findings suggest that the activation of CREB is essential for PGE2-induced MUC8 gene expression via ERK MAP kinase and RSK1.Fig. 4Effect of CREB on PGE2-induced MUC8 gene expression. Confluent cells were stimulated for the indicated times with PGE2, and then total proteins were collected for Western blot (A). The cells were transiently transfected with CREB-dominant negative (CREB S133A) construct and stimulated with PGE2 for 24 h prior to real-time quantitative PCR.

The CRE site is located at –803 of the MUC8 promoter. To analyze the DNA binding activity of PGE2-activated CREB, we performed an electromobility shift assay using the nuclear extracts of PGE2 treated NCI-H292 cells. As shown in Fig. 5, the activities of consensus CRE (CREc) and MUC8 specific CRE (CREs) oligonucleotides remarkably increased in response to PGE2. To identify specific CRE binding complexes, competition and supershift analysis were performed using 50-, and 100-fold excesses of non-radiolabeled (cold) CREc oligonucleotide and anti-phospho-CREB antibody, respectively. The specific band was found to be selectively inhibited by a consensus CRE competitor and to be supershifted by anti-phospho-CREB antibody (Fig. 5). These results indicate that activated CREB binds to a cis-acting element, CRE, in the MUC8 promoter.Fig. 5Identification of the CREB·CRE binding complex formed in response to PGE2. Confluent cells were stimulated for 1 h with PGE2. Nuclear protein extract from PGE2-treated NCI-H292 cells was subjected to electromobility shift assay. Nuclear proteins were incubated with CREc, CREs, 50- and 100-fold excesses of cold probe, or anti-phospho-CREB antibody before electromobility shift assay. The labeled nuclear proteins were separated by electrophoresis on 6% polyacrylamide gels, and the gels were dried and exposed to autoradiography at –70 °C.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)CRE Is Required for PGE2-induced MUC8 Transcription— Various deletion clones such as –1190 to +87, –973 to +87, and –549 to +87 were constructed based on the above –1644 to +87 clone.1 NCI-H292 cells were then transiently transfected with the various deletion mutants and treated with PGE2 (10 nm) for 24 h, respectively. As shown in Fig. 6A, PGE2 selectively increased the luciferase activity of the –973 to –549 region of the MUC8 promoter. However, its effect was reduced on fragments covering the –549 to +87 region, indicating that the –1644 to –973 region of MUC8 promoter may be necessary for response to PGE2. We examined whether CRE is required for PGE2-induced MUC8 transcription by selectively mutating the CREB-binding site, CRE, at –803. As a shown in Fig. 6B, mutant constructs of CRE site in MUC8 promoter, namely CREMI and CREM2, reduced responsiveness relative to the wild-type MUC8 promoter construct. These results show that CRE in the regulatory region of the MUC8 promoter is critical for the up-regulation of MUC8 transcriptional activity by PGE2.Fig. 6CRE is required for PGE2-induced MUC8 transcription. NCI-H292 cells were transiently transfected with various MUC8 promoter luciferase reporter constructs and stimulated with PGE2 for 24 h. Luciferase activity was then assessed in PGE2-treated and -untreated cells (A). Cells were transfected with the MUC8 promoter constructs containing mutated CRE sites as indicated (B). The luciferase activities were displayed after correction for transfection efficiency using the β-galactosidase activity of the cell lysates to standardize the values. The values shown are means ± standard deviations of experiments performed in triplicate.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)DISCUSSIONMucus hypersecretion is a common feature of various inflammatory airway diseases. Accordingly, an understanding of the expression and regulation of airway mucin genes is of considerable importance. Previous studies have suggested that MUC8 is a major mucin gene because inflammatory mediators up-regulate MUC8 gene expression in in vitro culture (19Seong J.K. Koo J.S. Lee W.J. Kim H.N. Park J.Y.

Apparent k values (V /[E]) max cat steady-state and Km values were determined from assays for each substrate-protein pair. When BGTP was the substrate, maximum turnover numbers for Gα and Gαi1 were 8.3 ± 1 × 10-3 and 3.0 ± 0.2 × 10-2 s-1, respectively, and Km values were 120 ± 60 and 940 ± 160 nm. Assays with BGTPγS yielded maximum turnover numbers of 1.6 ± 0.1 × 10-4 and 5.5 ± 0.3 × 10-4 s-1 for Gα and Gαi1; Km values were 14 o±8 and 87 ± 22 nm. Acceleration of Gα GTPase activity by regulators of G protein signaling (RGS) was demonstrated in both steady-state and pseudo-single-turnover assay formats with BGTP. Nanomolar RGS increased the rate of enzyme product formation (BODIPY® FL GDP (BGDP)) by 117–213% under steady-state conditions and accelerated the rate of G protein-BGTP complex decay by 199 –778% in pseudo-single-turnover assays. Stimulation of GTPase activity by RGS proteins was inhibited 38–81% by 40 μm YJ34, a previously reported peptide RGS inhibitor. Taken together, these results illustrate that Gα subunits utilize BGTP as a substrate similarly to GTP, making BGTP a useful fluorescent indicator of G protein activity. The unexpected levels of BGTPγS hydrolysis detected suggest that caution should be used when interpreting data from fluorescence assays with this probe.

Ligands binding to cell surface receptors signaling through G protein pathways (like G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) or receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs)) induce the G protein to exchange GDP for GTP, activating the protein. Activated G protein can transmit signals to downstream effectors such as adenylyl cyclase, phospholipases, ion channels, or cGMP phosphodiesterase, which ultimately result in cellular responses initiated by the extracellular ligand stimulus. Signaling is ceased by the hydrolysis of GTP to GDP via the intrinsic GTPase activity of the G protein (reviewed in Refs. 1Gilman A.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 615-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (4728) Google Scholar and 2Sprang S.R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 639-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (892) Google Scholar). G protein deactivation can be accelerated by interactions with GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) such as regulators of G protein signaling (RGS) (3Berman D.M. Wilkie T.M. Gilman A.G.

Most studies of G protein-mediated signaling have relied on utilization of guanine nucleotide analogues that both behave similarly to the native species and have been modified such that they can be sensitively detected. The most common modification involves insertion of radiolabeled isotopes of phosphorous or sulfur to yield [γ-32P]GTP and [γ-35S]GTPγS, which can then be used in filter-binding assays to measure GTPase activity and the extent of nucleotide binding, respectively. More recently, fluorescent guanine nucleotide derivatives N-methyl3′-O-anthranoyl (MANT) and BODIPY® have been developed (5Hiratsuka T. Biochim. Biophys.

A number of studies have reported on use of these fluorescent GTP derivatives with low molecular weight, Ras-like G proteins. In general, the binding affinities and rate constants reported for MANT analogues of GTP and GDP are within a factor of 2 of those for unmodified guanine nucleotides (7Neal S.E. Eccleston J.F.

Pharmacol. 2003; 368: 210-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar); these nucleotides also yield greater fluorescence enhancement upon binding to Gα subunits than their MANT counterparts (6McEwen D.P.

These properties have made them useful tools for fluorescence-based assays of nucleotide exchange (6McEwen D.P. Gee K.R. Kang H.C. Neubig R.R. Anal.

Biochem. 2001; 291: 109-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar); however, no kinetic information has been reported. Thus, it is unknown if BODIPY derivatives might serve as effective GTP mimics in studies of Gα activity and interactions with signaling modifiers such as RGS. We have assessed the GTPase activity of Gαi1 and Gαo sub-units with BODIPY® FL-labeled GTP analogues BGTP and BODIPY® FL GTPγS (BGTPγS) (Fig. 1). To track the dynamic changes that occur over the course of the enzymatic reaction, sample components were rapidly separated by capillary electrophoresis and detected using laser-induced fluorescence (CELIF). Overall, we found that basal GTPase activity and its modulation by GAPs and a synthetic peptide GAP inhibitor were similar to that reported for GTP; however, the presence of the fluorophore did cause significant deviations in some aspects of the activation/deactivation cycle. Materials—BGTPγS, BGTP, BGDP, and BODIPY® FL iodoacetamide were obtained from Molecular Probes, Inc. (Eugene, OR). 10× Tris/glycine buffer was purchased from Bio-Rad. Enzyme grade sodium phosphate monobasic was purchased from Fisher. His6-Gαo (Gαo), rmyristolated Gαi1 (Gαi1), Gαi1 mutants R178C and Q204L, RGS4, and RGS8 were expressed and purified as described previously (32Lee E. Linder M.E. Gilman A.G. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 237: 146-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, 33Popov S. Yu K. Kozasa T. Wilkie T.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Ac-Val-Lys-c(Et)(Cys-Thr-Gly-Ile-Cys)-Glu-NH2 (YJ34), where c(Et) designates cyclization via an ethylene dithioether linking the Cys side chains, was synthesized and purified as described previously (34Jin Y. Zhong H. Omnaas J.R. Neubig R.R. Mosberg H.I. J. Pept. Res. 2004; 63: 141-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), dissolved in Me2SO and stored as 2 mm aliquots at –20 °C. All other chemicals were from Sigma. Buffers were made with deionized water purified by an E-Pure water system (Barnestead International Co., Dubuque, IA) and filtered prior to use. Capillary Electrophoresis Instrumentation—For rapid CE separations, a CE-LIF instrument equipped with “flow-gated” injection similar to that described elsewhere was used (35German I. Kennedy R.T. J. Chromatogr. B. 2000; 742: 353-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 36Hooker T.F. Jorgenson J.W. Anal. Chem. 1997; 69: 4134-4142Crossref Scopus (164) Google Scholar). A block diagram depicting the instrument is shown in Fig. 2. Briefly, sample was loaded into a chamber that was then pressurized so that sample flowed from the chamber to the flow-gate interface through a fused silica capillary (Polymicro Technologies, Phoenix, AZ). The flow-gate controlled periodic injections (details below) onto the CE-LIF, where sample was rapidly separated. Electrophoresis buffer was supplied as a gating-flow at 1.0 –1.4 ml/min by a Series I high pressure liquid chromatography pump (LabAlliance; Fisher) equipped with an external pulse dampener. To inject sample onto the electrophoresis capillary, the gating-flow was diverted to waste using a 12V DC solenoid valve (Cole Palmer Instrument Co., Vernon Hills, IL), allowing sample to accumulate in the interface between the two capillaries. The injection voltage was then applied across the separation capillary by a high voltage power supply (CZE 1000R; Spellman High Voltage Electronics, Plainview, NY) for a specified amount of time to load sample onto the capillary column. Once sample was injected, gating-flow of electrophoresis buffer was resumed by actuating the gating valve, and separation voltage was applied. Serial injections could be performed at a rate limited by separation time. All operations were controlled by a personal computer equipped with a multifunction board (AT-MIO-16; National Instruments, Austin, TX) using software written in-house. Detection was accomplished using LIF as described elsewhere (37Tao L. Kennedy R.T. Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 3899-3906Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The LIF detector used the 488-nm line of an air-cooled 15-milliwatt Ar+ laser (Spectra Physics, Mountain View, CA) as the excitation source. Fluorescence was collected 90° from the excitation source via a ×40 microscope objective (Melles Griot, Irvine, CA). The fluorescence emission was spectrally filtered using a 520 ± 10-nm bandpass filter and a 488-nm notch filter (Corion, Holliston, MA) and spatially filtered through two pinholes (5 × 7 mm and 1.5 × 4 mm) before entering a photomultiplier tube (model E717-21; Hamamatsu Photonics, Bridgewater, NJ). Signal from the photomultiplier tube was amplified by a Keithley 428 current amplifier and collected using the same computer and software used for instrument control. Processing of electrophoresis data were performed with a program written in-house (38Shackman J.G. Watson C.J. Kennedy R.T. J. Chromatogr. A. 2004; 1040: 273-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Buffers and Sample Preparation—For all experiments with BGTPγS, separation buffer was 25 mm Tris, 192 mm glycine, pH 8.5 (TG). The separation buffer for BGTP assays was 90% TG, pH 8.5, 10% 100 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.1 (TGP). For all studies, samples were prepared in TG buffer supplemented with 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm dithiothreitol (TGEMD). All experiments were performed at room temperature. Detection and Characterization of BODIPY® FL Nucleotide Hydrolysis—Initially, BGTP hydrolysis by Gαi1 and Gαo was monitored for samples of 250 nm BGTP and 400 nm α subunit (Gαo, Gαi1, or Gαi1 mutant). G protein was added to BGTP at t = 0 s, and a portion of the reaction mixture was periodically injected onto the capillary column and analyzed by CE-LIF. Free BGTP, G protein-bound BGTP, and BGDP (enzyme product) were separated from each other by the application of a 1500-V/cm electric field. Changes in peak heights and areas for all components were monitored over ∼1200 s. BGTPγS hydrolysis experiments were performed in a similar manner, with 300 nm BGTPγS and 1.6 μm Gαi1.Gαi1-BGTPγS complex, free BGTPγS, and the product BODIPY® FL thiophosphate (BSP) were separated by the application of a 560-V/cm electric field. In a separate experiment, BSP was synthesized by reacting equimolar amounts of BODIPY® FL iodoacetamide and sodium thiophosphate dodecahydrate in 1:1 dimethyl formamide/ H2O for 2 h at room temperature. Synthesized BSP was added into a sample containing BGTPγS and a trace amount of enzyme product to confirm the identity of the product peak. For the characterization of kinetics parameters, G protein and BODIPY® FL nucleotide were mixed at t = 0 s, and the accumulation of enzyme product (either BSP or BGDP) was monitored over time until 10% of the substrate was depleted. The plot of product fluorescence (represented by either peak height or peak area) versus time was fit linearly to obtain the product formation rate in relative fluorescence units (RFU)/s for each substrate concentration. The rate in RFUs–1 was converted to ms-1 using the slope of the calibration curve for each product peak. Product formation rates obtained at each concentration of BGTPγS were corrected for the spontaneous (in the absence of G protein) decomposition of BGTPγS to BSP that occurs at pH 8.0 and above. The product formation rate was divided by the enzyme concentration to yield the turnover number, which was then plotted versus nucleotide concentration and fit to a single hyperbolic function according to y = (turnover × [S])/(KM + [S]) using GraphPad Prism 3.0 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA) to obtain Km and maximum turnover values (apparent kcat values). Specific sample compositions were as follows: 4 nm Gαo with 4 –35 nm BGTPγS; 10 nm Gαi1 with 90 –720 nm BGTPγS; 10 nm Gαi1 with 100 –5000 nm BGTP; and 10 nm Gαo with 50 –5000 nm BGTP. Stimulation of GTPase Activity by RGS—In steady-state RGS experiments, 325 nm RGS8 and 10 nm Gαo were added to 500 nm BGTP at t = 0 s. The progression of BGTP hydrolysis to BGDP in the presence and absence of RGS8 was assessed every 20 s. BGDP peak area was plotted versus time for all samples, and the extent of RGS8 stimulation of GTPase activity was estimated from a linear fit of the data from 0 to 750 s. Pseudo-single-turnover experiments were performed with samples consisting of 2 μm Gαo and 5 μm BGTP, where Gαo was added at t = 0s, and Gαo-BGTP association was monitored by serial injections made every 12 s. 210 nm RGS4 or 260 nm RGS8 was added in when Gαo-BGTP peak formation had reached a maximum, ∼200 s after Gαo had been added. To quantify the effect that RGS4 and RGS8 had on Gαo GTPase activity, a plot was made of Gαo-BGTP peak area versus time. The decay of the complex for each sample (with and without RGS added) was fit to a one-phase exponential decay function using GraphPad Prism, and the half-times and rates for each were compared. Experiments with the RGS inhibitor YJ34 were performed in a similar manner except that YJ34 (final concentration 40 μm) was preincubated with RGS at 4 °C before being added into the sample. Half-times and rates for the decay of the complex in the presence and absence of YJ34 were obtained as described above. Monitoring BGTP Hydrolysis—Fig. 3 depicts hydrolysis of BGTP by Gαo as monitored by CE-LIF. Trace 1 of Fig. 3A is a representative electropherogram of sample containing 250 nm BGTP prior to the addition of Gαo. BGDP was present as a trace contaminant in the free BGTP sample and migrated ahead of BGTP as indicated. Two peaks were detected for both BGTP and BGDP due to the nonhomogeneous labeling of the nucleotides on the ribose ring (see Fig. 1). With the addition of 400 nm Gαo to the sample, a new peak, corresponding to Gαo-BGTP complex, was detected with a migration time of 10 s (shown in Fig. 3A, trace 2, for t = 20 s after G protein was added). Although only one peak was observed for BGTP-Gαo in the electropherograms, the ratio of the 2′ and 3′ BGTP peak heights remained unchanged over the course of the experiment; thus, it is assumed that both isoforms bind to Gαo, but the isomers are unresolved once bound to the large protein. Also detectable in trace 2 are a decrease in the free BGTP peaks and a corresponding increase in the BGDP peaks, presumably the result of G protein enzymatic activity. 200 s after the addition of Gαo (Fig. 3A, trace 3), both free and complexed BGTP have been depleted and completely converted to BGDP. Peak areas for each of the three components (Gαo-BGTP complex, free BGDP, and free BGTP) are plotted versus time (where Gαo was added at t = 0 s) in Fig. 3B. Both Gαo-BGTP and free BGTP decreased exponentially with the decrease in complex fluorescence lagging behind the decrease in free BGTP. The half-time for BGDP formation was 66 ± 4 s, which corresponds well with the 67 ± 6-s half-time of Gαo-BGTP complex disappearance. The half-time for the decrease in free BGTP, however, was much faster (22 ± 2 s). The delay in complex disappearance as compared with BGTP can be attributed to the occurrence of multiple BGTP-Gαo binding events, all of which contributed to the total complex fluorescence and the depletion of free BGTP. The observed initial rapid binding of BGTP (which occurs much faster than the dissociation of GDP from Gαo) was most likely due to some of the Gαo (∼10%) being present as a GDP-free form (39Ferguson K.M. Higashijima T. Smigel M.D. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 7393-7399Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A Gαo-BGDP complex was not observed in these electropherograms, despite some evidence that BGDP does form a complex with Gαo (6McEwen D.P. Gee K.R. Kang H.C. Neubig R.R. Anal. Biochem. 2001; 291: 109-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). When the separation time was decreased from 20 to 6 s by increasing the electric field, a small peak corresponding to complex was detected. These results suggest that the complex dissociated too rapidly to be detected on the 20-s time scale, implying a weakly bound substrate. Supporting this conclusion, a separate set of fluorescence anisotropy experiments revealed that the KD of Gαo-BGDP was 1.6 ± 0.5 μm (data not shown). Mutation of Gαi1 Arg178 to Cys or Gln204 to Leu impairs GTPase activity (40Graziano M.P. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 15475-15482Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) but not nucleotide binding capabilities. To determine whether these mutations also blocked hydrolysis of BGTP, we compared the GTPase activities of Gαi1 with Gαi1 mutants R178C and Q204L. All forms of Gαi1 were observed to bind BGTP, as shown in Fig. 4A for Gαi1 R178C and wild-type (WT) Gαi1. The amount of mutant Gαi1-BGTP complex formed stabilized after 750 s due to the lack of enzymatic turnover. In contrast, the BGTP complex with WT Gαi1 reached its maximum peak area 100 s after protein was added to the sample and then rapidly decayed with a half-time of 112 ± 17 s as all BGTP was hydrolyzed to BGDP. The trends observed for each of the G protein-BGTP complex peaks are mirrored in the changes of the BGDP peak, as shown in Fig. 4B. BGDP formation in the WT Gαi1 sample increased rapidly up to its maximum value of 2.1 ± 0.1 RFU with a half-time of 102 ± 6 s and plateaued at the same time that the Gαi1-BGTP complex was depleted. In the Gαi1 R178C sample, BGDP was formed at a rate of 3.6 ± 0.3 × 10-11ms-1, an order of magnitude slower than the initial BGDP formation rate in the WT Gαi1 sample (5 ± 1 × 10-10ms-1. BGDP formation in Gαi1 Q204L samples was indistinguishable from blank samples containing no protein. Since RGS has been shown to restore Gαi1 R178C (but not Gαi1 Q204L) GTPase to that of basal Gαi1 (3Berman D.M. Wilkie T.M. Gilman A.G. Cell. 1996; 86: 445-452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar), it is not surprising to observe that Gαi1 R178C retains some GTPase function. Spontaneous conversion of BGTP to BGDP was not detected in the absence of G proteins. BGTPγS Is Hydrolyzed by G Proteins—BGTPγS has recently gained popularity as a fluorescent probe for Gα, since it yields a significant increase in fluorescence emission upon binding (6-fold for Gαo) (6McEwen D.P. Gee K.R. Kang H.C. Neubig R.R. Anal. Biochem. 2001; 291: 109-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). As a γ-S derivative, this analogue is generally treated as nonhydrolyzable in analogy to GTPγS; however, hydrolysis would not be readily detectable by ordinary fluorescence measurements. We therefore investigated G protein GTPase activity when BGTPγS was used as the substrate. A CE-LIF assay of sample containing 300 nm BGTPγS and 1.6 μm Gαi1 is shown in trace 1 of Fig. 5A. In addition to the Gαi1-BGTPγS complex peak, another peak (marked with an asterisk in Fig. 5A) was observed to increase with time, as illustrated in Fig. 5B. Qualitatively, the kinetic behavior was as expected for an enzymatic hydrolysis where the peak marked with the asterisk is the product. The peak height of the Gαi1-BGTPγS complex increased exponentially until it plateaued at 6.9 ± 0.2 RFU after ∼750 s. Gαi1-BGTPγS peak height remained constant until t = 1500 s and then began to steadily decrease. The rate of product formation accelerated as the complex peak approached steady-state and then decelerated concurrent with the decrease in complex as the substrate was consumed. In the steady-state complex region, product formation was linear at a rate of 2.7 ± 0.1 × 10-12ms-1. These changes in product formation rate as a function of the complex concentration are expected for Michaelis-Menten kinetics. In previous studies, the rate of product formation was found to increase with escalating G protein concentration (21Jameson E.E. Cunliffe J.M. Neubig R.R. Sunahara R.K. Kennedy R.T. Anal. Chem. 2003; 75: 4297-4304Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Additionally, the product peak was present regardless of the G protein being assayed, and upon the addition of excess GTPγS or GTP (which has been shown to displace the BGTPγS from the G protein), the increase in peak area ceased. The addition of unlabeled excess nucleotide profoundly decreased the BGTPγS-G protein complex, as expected (21Jameson E.E. Cunliffe J.M. Neubig R.R. Sunahara R.K. Kennedy R.T. Anal. Chem. 2003; 75: 4297-4304Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The most likely products of G protein-induced hydrolysis of BGTPγS are GDP and BSP. Of the two, only BSP is fluorescent and could therefore correspond to the detected product peak. Synthetic BSP was observed to electrophoretically co-migrate with the unknown product when added into the reaction mixture (data not shown). In separate experiments, mass spectrometry analysis of the reaction mixture revealed m/z that corresponded to the masses of BSP and GDP (data not shown). From these results, we concluded that BGTPγS is hydrolyzed by G proteins, and the fluorescent product of this hydrolysis is BSP. Determination of Km and Apparent kcat Values from Steadystate Hydrolysis Assays—The kinetics of BODIPY® FL nucleotide hydrolysis by Gαi1 and Gαo were characterized using the protocol given under “Experimental Procedures.” Fig. 6 illustrates how these parameters were obtained from raw CE-LIF data for Gαo with BGTP. A fit of the linear region of product peak area versus time for each substrate concentration yielded a product formation rate in RFUs–1 (Fig. 6A), which was converted to turnover number and plotted as a function of substrate concentration (Fig. 6B). Km and maximum turnover (apparent kcat) values were determined by fitting the data to y = (turnover × [S])/(KM + [S]). For Gαo with BGTP, the Km was 120 ± 60 nm, and the apparent kcat was 8.3 ± 1 × 10–3 s–1. A summary of the kinetic parameters determined for Gαi1 and Gαo with BGTP and BGTPγS is presented in Table I. Previously published values for Km (1Gilman A.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 615-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (4728) Google Scholar) and kcat (obtained from"

We investigated polarized sorting of the mammalian prion protein (PrP(C)) and its homologue doppel (Dpl). In contrast to Dpl, which accumulates on the apical surface, PrP(C) is targeted selectively to the basolateral side in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells. An extensive deletion and domain swapping analysis revealed that the internal hydrophobic domain (HD) of PrP (amino acids 113-133) confers basolateral sorting in a dominant manner. PrP mutants lacking the HD are sorted apically, while Dpl chimeras containing the HD of PrP are directed to the basolateral membrane. Furthermore, a pathogenic PrP missense mutation within the HD leads to aberrant apical sorting of PrP as well."

Rho-family GTPases are regulators of diverse biological activities including the organization of the actin cytoskeleton. The best known, “classical” members of this family are RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42. Activation of RhoA in fibroblasts induces the formation of stress fibers and focal adhesion, whereas active Rac1 and Cdc42 induce the extension of lamellipodia and filopodia, respectively (1Ridley A.J.

This molecule has an N-terminal GAP domain and binds to focal adhesions and stress fibers via its C-terminal region. Ectopic expression of RC-GAP72 in cultured fibroblasts induces disruption of actin stress fibers and extension of membrane ruffles, lamellipodia, and filopodia. These data as well as the effect of overexpression of different RC-GAP72 mutants indicate that the cytoskeletal localization of this protein and its interaction with Rac1 and/or Cdc-42 are essential for the disruption of stress fibers, whereas the induction of filopodia depends on the GAP activity irrespective of the cytoskeletal localization of the molecule.MATERIALS AND METHODSCells and Transfections—REF52 fibroblasts, HeLa cells, and 293T cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and antibiotics. HeLa and 293T cells were transfected using the standard calcium phosphate method, whereas the REF52 cells were transfected using 2 μg of plasmid DNA complexed with 1 mm polyethyleneimine reagent Mr 25,000 (Sigma) in culture medium.Reverse Transcription-PCR Analysis—Total RNA from murine tissues was extracted with TRI reagent (Molecular Research Center, Inc.) according to the company's recommended protocol. First-strand cDNA was synthesized using 1 μg of total RNA as a template, oligo(dT) as a primer, and Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). A PCR master mix was added to yield 1 μm specific primers, 200 μm dNTPs, 2.5 units of BIO-X-ACT DNA polymerase (Bioline), and BIO-X-ACT buffer containing 1.5 mm MgCl2. PCR was performed through 23 cycles (94 °C for 30 s, 56 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 30 s). The primer sequences used were as follows: RC-GAP72 (based on the mouse cDNA sequence, accession number BC023344) forward 5′-AGAGAAGCAGCGTGGACAAT-3′, reverse 5′-TGGACATTGTCGTAGGTGGA-3′; glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, forward 5′-ACCACAGTCCATGCCATCAC-3′, reverse 5′-TCCACCACCCTGTTGCTGTA-3′. The expected amplification products were 460 bp for the RC-GAP72 and 451 bp for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase.DNA Constructs—A human cDNA clone containing a RhoGAP homology domain in pdYFP-gen vector (DKFZp564B1162 cDNA clone, GenBank™ accession number AL136646) was kindly provided by Dr. R. Pepperkok (EMBL, Heidelberg, Germany) following a microscopy-based screening of expression libraries constructed from human brain by the group of S.

The RC-GAP72 mutants including ΔC RC-GAP72 construct (residues 1–470) bearing the RhoGAP domain and the ΔN RC-GAP72 construct (residues 291–655) (see the schematic representation in Fig. 5,1) were generated by PCR of the coding cDNA and subsequent subcloning of the PCR fragments into the BglII and SalI sites of pEYFP-C1 vector (Clontech) to be expressed as YFP fusions. R82K mutant, which bears an arginine-to-lysine mutation at the predicted catalytic site of the RhoGAP domain, was generated by introducing a point mutation using PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis by overlap extension (37Higuchi R.

Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6797) Google Scholar) and was cloned into pEYFP-C1 vector.Preparation of Antibodies—Antibodies to human RC-GAP72 were prepared by immunizing rabbits with a synthetic peptide (SWDKSESPQRSSMNN) corresponding to amino acids 282–296 of human RC-GAP72 conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin (Pierce). Antibodies were evaluated by Western blotting and immunofluorescence labeling.Biochemical Procedures—For Western blot analysis 293T and HeLa cells were lysed with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (1% Non-idet P-40, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, containing a mixture of protease inhibitors). Protein extracts were subjected to 8% SDS-PAGE, transferred to Hybond-C membrane (Amersham Biosciences), and immunoblotted. For in vivo GTPase activity assay, constructs expressing the Rho binding domain of Rhotekin (39Ren X.D. Kiosses W.B. Schwartz M.A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 578-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (1355) Google Scholar) and p21 binding domain of PAK1 (40Benard V. Bohl B.P. Bokoch G.M. J. Biol.

Liu and K. Burridge (University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill). For determination of the intrinsic and GAP-stimulated GTPase activities of Cdc42, Rac1, and RhoA, HeLa cells were transfected with YFP-encoding plasmid as a control and vectors encoding YFP-tagged wild type or mutated RC-GAP72, and the assay was performed as described (39Ren X.D.

The amount of RhoA-GTP, Rac1-GTP, or Cdc42-GTP that was pulled down by the bead-associated GTPase binding domain of PAK1 or Rhotekin as well as the total amount of these G-proteins in the cell lysates was determined by immunoblotting using monoclonal antibodies against RhoA (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), Rac1, or Cdc42 (Transduction Laboratories). The amounts of YFP-RC-GAP72, and its mutant forms were estimated by Western blotting using anti-GFP antibody (Roche Applied Science). To measure the interaction between RC-GAP72 and Rac1/Cdc42, 293T cells were co-transfected with constructs encoding RC-GAP72 and wild type Rac1 or Cdc42. The amount of YFP-fused RC-GAP72 and its mutants co-precipitated with an active form of the GTPases and pulled down by the bead-associated p21 binding domain of PAK1 was estimated using anti-GFP (Roche Applied Science) and anti-RC-GAP72 antibodies.Immunofluorescence Microscopy—Cells were cultured on glass coverslips, fixed-permeabilized for 2 min in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 0.5% Triton X-100 and 3% formaldehyde, and post-fixed with 3% formaldehyde in PBS for 30 min. The cells were then rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline and stained with anti-paxillin (Transduction Laboratories), anti-α-actinin (Sigma), or anti-Myc epitope 9E10 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) monoclonal antibodies for 1 h, washed, and further incubated with Cy3-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories). For actin staining cells were incubated with TRITC-conjugated phalloidin for 20 min and mounted in Elvanol (Moviol 4–88, Hoechst). Images were acquired using the DeltaVision system (Applied Precision Inc.) on an Axiovert 125 TV inverted microscope (Zeiss,). Image acquisition and processing were controlled by a Silicon Graphics work station model O2 (Mountain View) using the Resolve3D and Priism software packages (Applied Precision Inc.).RESULTSCharacterization of RC-GAP72—A bioinformatics search using the BLAST and NCBI Conserved Domain Search programs indicated that a new cDNA clone (GenBank™ accession number AL136646, also known as ARHGAP24 according to the new nomenclature classification (HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee)) encodes a putative protein of 655 amino acids. This protein contains an N-terminal-located RhoGAP domain (residues 60–233) in which the critical residues required for GAP activity, including a highly conserved arginine (Arg-82), are present. This protein functions as a GAP specific for Rac1 and Cdc42 (see next paragraph) and was, therefore, named RC-GAP72 (Rac1/Cdc42-specific GAP with a predicted molecular mass of 72 of kDa). The RhoGAP domain of RC-GAP72 shows 90 and 77% sequence similarity to the corresponding regions of RhoGAP2 (GenBank™ accession number NP_067049) and KIAA0053 (XP_376060), with a lower similarity to other RhoGAPs (e.g. N-chimaerin, oligophrenin1, RICH-1, GRAF, and p190ARhoGAP). Outside the RhoGAP domain the cDNA sequence of RC-GAP72 diverges from other RhoGAPs, except RhoGAP2, to which it shows an overall protein sequence similarity of 53%. Using human cDNA sequences, we identified the mouse ortholog of RC-GAP72 (GenBank™ accession number BC023344). Both the human and the mouse genes are composed of seven exons, and the mouse RC-GAP72 shows 85% sequence identity to the human RC-GAP72 cDNA and 87% identity to the human protein.To elucidate the function of the N-terminal RhoGAP domain of RC-GAP72, we determined its effect on the activation of Rho-family GTPases in cultured cells. The constructs encoding wild-type RC-GAP72-YFP or YFP alone, used as a control, were expressed in HeLa cells, and the levels of activated RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42 were determined. As shown in Fig. 1, the levels of active Rac1 and Cdc42 were significantly reduced in the presence of wild-type RC-GAP72 compared with cells expressing YFP alone. The levels of RhoA-GTP, on the other hand, were not affected, suggesting that RC-GAP72 enhances GTPase activity of Rac1 and Cdc42 but not RhoA.Fig. 1GAP activity of RC-GAP72 on Rho family GTPases in cultured cells. The constructs encoding wild-type RC-GAP72 fused to YFP as well as YFP alone as a control were expressed in HeLa cells, and the levels of activated RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42 were determined. The levels of active Rac1 and Cdc42 were significantly reduced in cells expressing wild-type RC-GAP72 compared with cells expressing YFP alone. The level of RhoA-GTP was not affected by RC-GAP72.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Analysis of RC-GAP72 mRNA and Protein Expression— The expression pattern of RC-GAP72 in different murine tissues was studied using mRNA from adult mouse tissues. RC-GAP72 mRNA was ubiquitously expressed in all tissues analyzed; however, the expression was particularly high in the kidney (Fig. 2A). RNA and protein extracts from several human cell lines were also analyzed, including human foreskin fibroblasts, human embryonic kidney 293T cells, prostate cancer cell lines PC-3, LNCaP, and DU-15, colon carcinoma SW480, renal carcinoma KTCTL60, and lung non-small-cell carcinoma H1299 cell lines. Of these only HeLa and H1299 cells expressed detectable levels of RC-GAP72 mRNA and protein (data not shown).Fig. 2Expression of RC-GAP72 mRNA and protein.A, the expression pattern of RC-GAP72 mRNA in adult murine tissues.

Lane 1, HeLa cells transfected with RC-GAP72-YFP cDNA; lane 2, non-transfected cells. The band of ∼120 kDa corresponds to the exogenous YFP-RC-GAP; the 80-kDa band corresponds to the endogenous RC-GAP72. GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenaseView Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To determine the expression pattern and size of the endogenous RC-GAP72 protein, we generated a polyclonal antibody against a polypeptide corresponding to amino acids 282–296 of human RC-GAP72 and tested its reactivity with RC-GAP72-YFP expressed in HeLa cells (Fig. 2B, lane 1). Immunoblotting analysis revealed two immunoreactive bands of ∼120 kDa, corresponding to the exogenous RC-GAP72-YFP, and 80 kDa, consistent with the predicted molecular mass of RC-GAP72. Non-transfected HeLa cells (Fig. 2B, lane 2) showed only the 80-kDa band.To determine the cellular localization of RC-GAP72, REF52 fibroblasts and MDCK (epithelial) cells were transiently transfected with a plasmid encoding RC-GAP72 fused to YFP. In REF52 cells fluorescent RC-GAP72 was associated with the actin stress fibers (Fig. 3, A–C) with particular enrichment in the associated focal adhesion. In that area RC-GAP72 co-localized with several markers of focal adhesion including paxillin (Fig. 3, D–F) and vinculin (not shown). RC-GAP72 was also associated with the actin-rich lamellipodium (Fig. 3A, arrow), suggesting that this protein plays a role in regulating cell adhesion and motility. In MDCK cells RC-GAP72 co-localized primarily along the α-actinin-containing adherens junctions as well as in the nucleus (Fig. 3, G–I). Interestingly, the relative intensity of RC-GAP72 along stress fibers compared with focal adhesions was affected by the level of protein expression in the cell. Thus, in cells expressing low levels of the protein, fluorescent RC-GAP72 concentrated primarily in focal adhesions (Fig. 4A), whereas at high expression levels the protein was widely distributed along the entire stress fiber system (Fig. 4B).Fig. 3Subcellular localization of RC-GAP72 in cultured cells. REF52 fibroblasts (A–F) and MDCK epithelial cells (G–I) were transiently transfected with a plasmid encoding full-length RC-GAP72-YFP and stained for actin (A–C), paxillin (D–F), or α-actinin (G–I). In REF52 cells fluorescent RC-GAP72 (A and D) co-localized with the actin stress fibers (B) and with paxillin-rich focal adhesions (E). In MDCK cells, RC-GAP72 (G) localized primarily along the α-actinin-containing adherens junctions (H) as well as in the nucleus. Co-localization of the two labels is shown in merge images C, F, and I.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Fig. 4Differential association of RC-GAP72 with stress fibers and focal adhesions is affected by the level of protein expression in the cell.

In contrast to the full-length RC-GAP72, which concentrates on stress fibers and focal adhesions (Fig. 5, 2A), the N-terminal domain corresponding to amino acids 1–470 (ΔC RC-GAP72), which includes the RhoGAP domain, was diffusely dispersed in the cytoplasm (Fig. 5, 2B), suggesting that the N-terminal domain does not contain the cytoskeleton-binding sites of RC-GAP72. On the other hand the C-terminal 364-amino acid RC-GAP72 mutant (ΔN RC-GAP72) lacking the RhoGAP domain co-localized with actin stress fibers and focal adhesions just like the full-length protein (Fig. 5, 2C). Expression of the central region of RC-GAP72 (amino acids 291–470) resulted in diffuse cytoplasmic fluorescence (not shown), suggesting that the domain that determines cytoskeletal localization of the protein is located within the 185 C-terminal amino acids of RC-GAP72. We further examined a full-length mutant of RC-GAP72 bearing an Arg to Lys mutation at position 82. Arginine in this location is known to be essential for efficient catalytic activity toward Rho family proteins but does not affect binding to the target proteins (41Scheffzek K. Ahmadian M.R. Wittinghofer A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 257-262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar, 42Graham D.L. Eccleston J.F. Lowe P.N.

As expected, mutation of the essential arginine resulted in RC-GAP72 inactivation (data not shown), and it had no apparent effect on the subcellular localization of the protein (Fig. 5, 2D).The Effect of RC-GAP72 Overexpression on the Organization of the Actin Cytoskeleton—The ability of RC-GAP72 to regulate actin organization was tested by overexpressing the full-length protein in REF52 fibroblasts and visualized by staining actin filaments with fluorescent phalloidin.

https://openalex.org/W2163130355,"The functions of the mechanosensitive channels from Lactococcus lactis were determined by biochemical, physiological, and electrophysiological methods. Patch-clamp studies showed that the genes yncB and mscL encode MscS and MscL-like channels, respectively, when expressed in Escherichia coli or if the gene products were purified and reconstituted in proteoliposomes. However, unless yncB was expressed in trans, wild type membranes of L. lactis displayed only MscL activity. Membranes prepared from an mscL disruption mutant did not show any mechanosensitive channel activity, irrespective of whether the cells had been grown on low or high osmolarity medium. In osmotic downshift assays, wild type cells survived and retained 20% of the glycine betaine internalized under external high salt conditions. On the other hand, the mscL disruption mutant retained 40% of internalized glycine betaine and was significantly compromised in its survival upon osmotic downshifts. The data strongly suggest that L. lactis uses MscL as the main mechanosensitive solute release system to protect the cells under conditions of osmotic downshift."

Recombinant cFbpA is isolated with ferric iron bound from Escherichia coli. The crystal structure of cFbpA reveals unprecedented iron coordination by only five protein ligands. The histidine and one tyrosine are derived from the N-terminal domain, whereas the three remaining tyrosine ligands are from the C-terminal domain. Surprisingly, a synergistic anion present in all other characterized ferric transport proteins is not observed in the cFbpA iron-binding site, suggesting a novel role for this protein in iron uptake. Furthermore, cFbpA is shown to bind iron with high affinity similar to Neisserial FbpA and exhibits an unusual preference for ferrous iron (oxidized subsequently to the ferric form) or ferric iron chelated by oxalate. Sequence and structure analyses reveal that cFbpA is a member of a new class of ferric binding proteins that includes homologs from invasive and intracellular bacteria as well as cyanobacteria. Overall, six classes are defined based on clustering within the tree and by their putative iron coordination. The absence of a synergistic anion in the iron coordination sphere of cFbpA also suggests an alternative model of evolution for FbpA homologs involving an early iron-binding ancestor instead of a requirement for a preexisting anion-binding ancestor.

The obstacles that prokaryotes face in the acquisition of growth essential iron are substantial. Within an oxic environment, available iron is limited because of its low solubility. Iron is further sequestered in animals by host iron-binding proteins, such as transferrin and lactoferrin (1Braun V. Killman H. Trends Biochem.

Bacteria can acquire ferric iron by the production and absorption of siderophores or by an FbpABC transport system that is typically coupled with outer membrane receptors for specific host iron sources, such as transferrin or lactoferrin (2Ratledge C.

Microbiol. 2001; 291: 125Google Scholar) are characterized. Although C. jejuni is unable to acquire iron from transferrin or lactoferrin, homologs of an FbpABC transport system (cFbpABC) are present (4A Vliet H.M.v. Ketley J.M. Park S.F. Penn C.W. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2002; 26: 173-186Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and are iron-regulated (9Palyada K. Threadgill D. Stintzi A. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 4714-4729Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). The FbpABC transport system is best characterized in pathogenic Neisseria sp. (10Schryvers A.B. Stojiljkovic I. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 32: 117-123Crossref Scopus (206) Google Scholar) and Haemophilus influenzae (11Adhikari P. Kirby S.D. Nowalk A.J. Veraldi K.L. Schryvers A.B. Mietzner T.A. J. Biol.

Microbiol. 1998; 225: 113-135PubMed Google Scholar). Direct contact of the bacterial outer membrane receptors to their respective host iron-binding proteins, transferrin or lactoferrin, is first established followed by iron removal and entry into the periplasm. Uptake of iron into the cytoplasm is then facilitated by the FbpABC transport system, whereby FbpA is the periplasmic binding protein component, and FbpB and FbpC constitute the permease and ATPase components, respectively. FbpA is classified within the periplasmic substrate-binding protein superfamily and is grouped with the inorganic ion transporters (13Tam R. Saier M.H. Microbiol. Rev. 1993; 57: 320-346Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). All structurally characterized FbpAs share a similar structure consisting of two domains connected by a pair of antiparallel β-sheets containing the hinge region. The ferric iron in the FbpA from Neisseria sp. (nFbpA) and H. influenzae (hFbpA) is found at the domain interface and is coordinated by a His, a Glu, two Tyr residues, a water molecule, and a synergistic phosphate anion (14Bruns C.M. Norwalk A.J. Arvai A.S. McTigue M.A. Vaughan K.G. Mietzner T.A. McRee D.E. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 919-924Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). This coordination is strikingly similar to that of mammalian transferrin in which iron is coordinated by a His, an Asp, two Tyr residues, and a synergistic carbonate anion (15Baker E.N. Adv. Inorg. Chem. 1994; 41: 389-463Crossref Scopus (214) Google Scholar), leading to these FbpAs being referred to as bacterial transferrins (16Dhungana S. Taboy C.H. Anderson D.S. Vaughan K.G. Aisen P. Mietzner T.A. Crumbliss A.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 3659-3664Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). However, the mechanisms by which FbpA and transferrin coordinate iron are believed to have arisen by convergent evolution, because the iron ligands come from nonequivalent regions in FbpA and transferrin despite sharing a common protein fold (14Bruns C.M. Norwalk A.J. Arvai A.S. McTigue M.A. Vaughan K.G. Mietzner T.A. McRee D.E. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 919-924Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). The recently published crystal structure of FbpA from Mannheimia hemolytica (mFbpA) reveals an unusual iron site comprised of three Tyr residues and a carbonate anion (17Shouldice S.R. Skene R.J. Dougan D.R. Snell G. McRee D.E. Schryvers A.B. Tari L.W. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 3903-3910Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Here, we report the crystal structure of the C. jejuni ferric binding protein cFbpA (Protein Data Bank code 1Y4T) that reveals unprecedented iron coordination with no requirement for a synergistic anion. The lack of a synergistic anion in cFbpA has direct implications for iron binding and release. cFbpA also exhibits unusual iron-binding characteristics by preferentially binding iron when supplied in the free ferrous form as opposed to free ferric ions. Sequence and structure analyses of identified homologs confirm that cFbpA represents a new class of FbpA and suggest a unique function in iron uptake. Cloning and Expression of cFbpA from C. jejuni NCTC 11168 —Purified genomic DNA was obtained from Dr. Erin Gaynor (University of British Columbia). The coding region of cFbpA, lacking the signal sequence, was amplified by PCR using the 5′ primer (5′-AACTGCACCCATGGCTAGTGAGCTTAATATTTACTCAGC-3′) and the 3′ primer (5′-ATACTCGAGGCGGCCTTCAATTCTAAAACCGACTTCATCGTAAATTT-3′). The primers include NcoI and XhoI restriction sites, for cloning into a pET28a expression vector (Novagen, Madison, WI) in-frame with a C-terminal His tag. The 3′ primer also includes a Factor Xa site for removal of the His tag. Recombinant expression was performed in Escherichia coli HMS174(DE3) cells (Novagen). Growth medium consisted of 2× YT (Difco) supplemented with 25 μg/ml kanamycin. Inoculated cultures were grown initially at 37 °C and then transferred to 30 °C. The cells were induced at an A600 of 0.5–0.6 with 0.5 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside and grown overnight. The cells were lysed at 4 °C using an Avestin EmulsiFlex-C5 homogenizer. The soluble fraction was applied to a ProBond nickel resin column (Invitrogen), and the red cFbpA protein was eluted using imidazole. The histidine tag was removed by digestion with Factor Xa (Hematologics) in 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, followed by inactivated with 1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride. Equimolar ferrous sulfate was added to the protein, followed by buffer replacement with 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. The purity and homogeneity of the sample was assessed by SDS-PAGE and mass spectrometry. Apo cFbpA was obtained by incubating the holo cFbpA with 1000 m excess EDTA in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, for 10 min. The buffer was exchanged with 200 mm NaCl and 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, by gel filtration. Crystal Structures—Holo cFbpA crystals were grown at 19 °C by the hanging drop vapor diffusion method and microseeding. The reservoir contained 24% polyethylene glycol 4000, 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8, and 60 mm sodium acetate. Each drop was made from an equal volume of reservoir and a 15 mg/ml protein stock solution. The crystals were transferred to the reservoir plus 30% (v/v) glycerol and looped directly into a cryostream at 100 K. X-ray data were collected on a home laboratory source using a MAR345 image plate system. The data frames were indexed, and the resulting intensities were scaled and merged with DENZO and SCALEPACK (18Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Method Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38617) Google Scholar). The holo cFbpA crystal grew in space group P21 (a = 54.45, b = 90.70, c = 56.83, and β = 92.39) with two molecules in the asymmetric unit (solvent content of 38%). A comparative model of cFbpA was constructed using the apo FbpA structure from Bordetella pertussis (Protein Data Bank code 1Y9U) as a template (19Schwede T. Kopp J. Guex N. Peitsch M.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 3381-3385Crossref PubMed Scopus (4537) Google Scholar). Each of the two domains of the resulting cFbpA model was superimposed onto the corresponding domains of Haemophilus holo FbpA (Protein Data Bank code 1MRP) (14Bruns C.M. Norwalk A.J. Arvai A.S. McTigue M.A. Vaughan K.G. Mietzner T.A. McRee D.E. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 919-924Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar) to generate a model of the holo cFbpA. A molecular replacement solution was obtained using the holo cFbpA coordinates and the program MolRep (20Vagin A. Teplyakov A. J. Appl.

The cFbpA structure displays excellent stereochemistry, as shown by a Ramachandran plot, with 95.5% of the residues residing in the most favored regions and the remaining residues in the allowed regions (25Laskowski R.A.

Open table in a new tab Iron Binding Studies—The visible spectroscopic data were obtained on a Varian Cary Bio50 UV spectrophotometer using a 1-cm-path length 80-μl quartz cuvette at room temperature. All of the reagents used were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Holo nFbpA was obtained as described previously (26Bekker E.G. Creagh A.L. Sanaie N. Yumoto F. Lau G.H.Y. Tanokura M. Haynes C.A. Murphy M.E.P. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 9195-9203Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). All of the iron binding experiments were performed using 2 mg/ml (0.055 mm) apo protein. Visible absorbance was monitored for 10 min after the addition of an equimolar concentration of iron. The iron sources were ferric chloride, ferrous sulfate, and ferric chloride chelated by a 100 m excess of oxalate. Following the 10-min incubation with ferrous sulfate, sodium bicarbonate was added to a final concentration of 5.5 mm and monitored for an additional 10 min. Iron affinity was estimated by the addition of 0–7 mm sodium pyrophosphate to holo cFbpA or holo nFbpA in 30 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4. Phylogenetic Analyses—Protein sequences homologous to the FbpA from H. influenzae (ZP 00157690.1), B. pertussis Tomaha I (NP 880337.1), and C. jejuni NCTC 11168 (NP 281385.1) were identified in the nr data base with the BlastP (27Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (71456) Google Scholar) portal at the National Institutes of Health (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST/). FbpA homologs were selected from the 100 best hits from each BlastP search such that the sequences shared 75% identity or less, exhibited an E value of 10–20 or less, and were annotated to identified prokaryotes. Protein sequences were aligned with ClustalW (28Higgins D.G. Thompson J.D. Gibson T.J. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 266: 383-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (1288) Google Scholar) using a gap opening penalty of 15 and a BLOSUM series matrix, followed by the generation of a neighbor-joining bootstrapped tree. The alignment was refined manually in BioEdit (29Hall T.A. Nucleic Acids Symp. Ser. 1999; 41: 95-98Google Scholar) to exclude the signal sequences. A second tree was made using maximum likelihood analysis with TREE-PUZZLE 5.0 (30Schmidt H.A. Strimmer K. Vingron M. Haeseler A.v. Bioinformatics. 2002; 18: 502-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (2174) Google Scholar). The parameters used were 250,000 puzzling quartets, exact parameter estimates, and exact maximum likelihood. Subsequent BlastP searches and tree constructions were performed to find additional FbpA sequences. cFbpA Structure—The overall structure of cFbpA consists of two globular domains linked by two β-strands (Fig. 1A). The N-terminal domain is comprised of residues 5–103 and 239–283. The remaining residues, 104–238 and 284–321, form the C-terminal domain. Each domain is formed from α-β-α units that contribute to form a central five-stranded β-sheet surrounded by six α-helices in the N-terminal domain and a central three-stranded β-sheet surrounded by eight α-helices in the C-terminal domain. The hinge region, which may allow for domain movement, is located within the two β-strands. Ferric binding proteins are typically monomers, and the two molecules in the asymmetric unit are essentially the same (0.26 Å root mean square deviation on α-carbons) and make few contacts. All of the subsequent results are for molecule A. The iron-binding site is located at the domain interface, and the five coordinating residues originate from both domains (Fig. 1B). The coordination sphere is composed of His14 near the N terminus and four Tyr residues: one from the N-terminal domain (Tyr15) and three from the C-terminal domain (Tyr146, Tyr202, and Tyr203). His14 and Tyr15 are part of a long loop, whereas Tyr146, Tyr202, and Tyr203 are contributed from the N termini of two α-helices. The iron is coordinated in a distorted octahedral geometry with one absent site (see Table SI). Surprisingly, no density is observed for an anion near the iron-binding site in the 2Fo – Fc map (Fig. 2). The four coordinating Tyr residues are ∼1.9–2.1 Å from the iron and have B-factors similar to that of the bound iron (13 Å2). In contrast, His14 forms a weaker interaction with iron (∼2.3 Å), and the imidazole ring average B-factor is elevated (20.6 Å2). In addition, the iron-ligand bond is 40° out of the imidazole plane, which intersects the OH atoms of Tyr146 and Tyr203 that are located 3.14 and 2.70 Å from His14 NE2, respectively (see Table SII and Fig. S1). Surrounding the iron site are networks of charged and polar amino acids (Fig. 1B). Most notably, five Arg residues (Arg13, Arg105, Arg107, Arg140, and Arg183) are within 10 Å of the iron center. The closest noncoordinating group is the guanidinium of Arg105 (4.1 Å). Interestingly, Arg105 in the C-terminal domain is part of a relay of buried salt bridges around one side of the iron site that includes the N-terminal domain residues Glu275, Arg13, and Asp18. In addition to connecting the N- and C-terminal domains, Arg105 lies within the hinge region. The N- and C- terminal domains are also connected through a H-bond interaction involving Asn237, also located in the hinge region but on the opposite strand, and Asp63 of the N-terminal domain. A third charge network involving Arg140, Asp182, and Arg107 is found solely in the C-terminal domain. In addition, two C-terminal domain residues form H-bonds with the OH atoms of the Tyr iron ligands (the guanidinium of Arg105 with Tyr15 and the side chain amide of Asn200 with Tyr202). Iron Binding—The addition of iron to apo cFbpA gives an absorbance maximum at 440 nm, indicative of a ferric-tyrosinate interaction (31Patch M.G. Carrano C.J. Inorg. Chim. Acta. 1981; 56: 71-73Crossref Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the addition of free ferrous iron or ferric iron chelated by oxalate results in significantly higher absorbance readings as compared with free ferric ions (Fig. 3A). Further addition of excess carbonate to the protein sample saturated with ferrous ions does not alter the absorbance reading. Competition experiments with the iron chelator pyrophosphate were used to define the affinity of cFbpA for iron (Fig. 3B). Increasing concentrations of pyrophosphate blue shifts and decreases the visible absorbance of both holo cFbpA and holo nFbpA. For holo cFbpA, a chelator:protein ratio of 2:1 reduces the initial absorbance reading to half. A ratio of 20:1 is needed for holo nFbpA, indicating that the iron binding constant of cFbpA is likely within an order of magnitude of nFbpA. Sequence Analyses—The FbpA homologs found in the sequence data base are derived from diverse prokaryotes including proteobacteria, cyanobacteria, Gram-positive bacteria, and archaea. The tree generated by TREE-PUZZLE divides the sequences into eight clusters (Fig. 4, see also Fig. S2). Six classes of FbpAs were defined on the basis of these eight clusters as well as the conservation of residues known to coordinate iron from the FbpA crystal structures. The clusters correspond to individual classes, except for Classes II and III, which are composed of two clusters each. Classes I, II, and III contain more than nine members each and include the structurally characterized nFbpA, mFbpA, and cFbpA, respectively. Classes IV–VI contain three members each and are not yet structurally characterized. Class IV contains FbpAs from environmental bacteria, whereas Class V and VI include FbpA homologs from prokaryotes that are nonpathogens as well as extremophiles and cyanobacteria. The class definitions are also consistent with observed insertions and deletions in the multiple sequence alignment (Fig. 5). Sequences in Classes I, V, and VI have small deletions near alignment position 179, and only in Class I are two amino acids deleted. Furthermore, Class V has a three-amino acid insertion relative to Classes I and VI near alignment position 235. Classes II and III are distinguished clearly from each other and all other FbpAs by single deletions at alignment position 39 and 214, respectively. Class IV can be distinguished from Classes II and III by a large deletion near alignment position 212. Only two of the residues known to coordinate iron, Tyr202 and Tyr203 in cFbpA (Fig. 1B) corresponding to alignment positions 204 and 205 (Fig. 5), are conserved in all except one FbpA. The exception is the Class V FbpA from Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803, which appears to have diverged significantly from the family. A third Tyr coordinated to iron in C. jejuni (Tyr146) is conserved in half of the classes (Class II, III, and IV). The fourth iron ligand in cFbpA, Tyr15, is observed only in Class III and is conserved in most of these FbpAs. The remaining ligand, His14, is conserved in both Class I and most of Class III FbpAs. The obstacles that organisms face in the acquisition of ferric iron, because of its low solubility and reduction potential, are substantial. Consequently, iron binding and transport proteins bind iron with high affinity. The first picture by x-ray crystallography of a high affinity iron transport protein was of the mammalian transferrin-lactoferrin family (15Baker E.N. Adv. Inorg. Chem. 1994; 41: 389-463Crossref Scopus (214) Google Scholar). The transferrins show iron bound in an octahedral geometry not only by the protein ligands (two Tyr residues, a His, and an Asp) but also by carbonate, a synergistic anion for iron binding. The crystal structures of bacterial iron transport proteins, hFbpA, nFbpA, and mFbpA, also show iron bound using a combination of protein ligands and synergistic anions (one His, one Glu, two Tyr residues, and one phosphate for hFbpA and nFbpA; three Tyr residues and one carbonate for mFbpA). Interestingly, the iron ligands in these bacterial FbpAs are not spatially equivalent to that of transferrin (14Bruns C.M. Norwalk A.J. Arvai A.S. McTigue M.A. Vaughan K.G. Mietzner T.A. McRee D.E. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 919-924Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Also, the carbonate-binding site in mFbpA is displaced relative to the anion-binding sites of hFbpA, nFbpA, and transferrin. Nevertheless, these structures suggest an apparent requirement for a synergistic anion in iron transport proteins. Surprisingly, the cFbpA structure in the closed conformation reveals unprecedented iron coordination incorporating only protein ligands. The unique iron-binding mechanism in cFbpA establishes a new class of FbpAs, Class III. The closed conformation of the crystal structure of iron-loaded cFbpA is defined in comparison with the holo hFbpA structure. Superimposition of 125 CAs from the cFbpA structure, representing the core of both domains, onto the equivalent CAs from the hFbpA structure yields an root mean square deviation of 0.88 Å. In contrast, similar superimposition of both domains of the cFbpA structure with the apo hFbpA structure (Protein Data Bank code 1D9V) is not possible because of a 21° relative domain rotation about the apo hFbpA hinge region, resulting in an open conformation (32Bruns C.M. Anderson D.S. Vaughan K.G. Williams P.A. Norwalk A.J. McRee D.E. Mietzner T.A. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 15631-15637Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The unexpected result arising from the cFbpA structure is that iron is bound without the need for a synergistic anion in the closed conformation. Instead iron is coordinated solely by five protein derived ligands (His and four Tyr residues). Inspection of the absent site within the distorted octahedral geometry shows that anion access to this position is sterically hindered by the phenolate rings of Tyr15, Tyr202, and Tyr203 (Fig. 2). The lack of a synergistic anion is surprising because these anions are thought to play critical roles in the initiation of iron binding and release in iron transport proteins. Carbonate is synergistic for iron binding to transferrin (33Sclabach M.R. Bates G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 2182-2188Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and a low pH crystal structure suggests a role for bound carbonate in the initiation of iron release (34MacGillivray R.T. Moore S.A. Chen J. Anderson B.F. Baker H. Luo Y. Bewley M. Smith C.A. Murphy M.E. Wang Y. Mason A.B. Wood-worth R.C. Brayer G.D. Baker E.N. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 7919-7928Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). In Class I FbpAs (hFbpA and nFbpA), phosphate and the two conserved Tyr residues form an iron half-site that is proposed to bind iron before forming a closed holo structure (32Bruns C.M. Anderson D.S. Vaughan K.G. Williams P.A. Norwalk A.J. McRee D.E. Mietzner T.A. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 15631-15637Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Also, phosphate is necessary for the formation of the closed conformation (26Bekker E.G. Creagh A.L. Sanaie N. Yumoto F. Lau G.H.Y. Tanokura M. Haynes C.A. Murphy M.E.P. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 9195-9203Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). In mFbpA (Class II), three C-terminal Tyr residues form the analogous half-site, eliminating the need for an anion (phosphate) at this position (35Shouldice S.R. Dougan D.R. Williams P.A. Skene R.J. Snell G. Scheibe D. Kirby S. Hosfield D.J. McRee D.E. Schryvers A.B. Tari L.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 41093-41098Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar); however, a carbonate anion is observed in the closed holo structure (Protein Data Bank code 1SI0) and is the only additional iron ligand (Fig. 1D) (17Shouldice S.R. Skene R.J. Dougan D.R. Snell G. McRee D.E. Schryvers A.B. Tari L.W. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 3903-3910Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Although a synergistic anion is not observed in the holo cFbpA structure, a combination of iron site residues conserved with either hFbpA or mFbpA may substitute for the functions of a synergistic anion. The presence of Tyr146 suggests a similar preordered half-site formed from three C-terminal Tyr ligands (Fig. 1, A and B). As in hFbpA, the conserved N-terminal His14 (along with Tyr15 of cFbpA) creates a direct iron bridged link between the N- and C-terminal domains. In cFbpA, the near neutral pKa of His and observed weaker interaction of His14 with iron in the crystal structure suggests a role for this residue in mediating iron release, similar to the role of carbonate in transferrin. That the anion is superfluous is further emphasized by spectroscopic observations that a synergistic anion is not required for high affinity iron binding to cFbpA (Fig. 3). In addition, recombinant cFbpA is isolated from E. coli loaded with iron. These observations suggest a function for cFbpA as a component of a high affinity iron transport system in C. jejuni. However, the cFbpABC transport system likely functions differently compared with that from Neisseria because C. jejuni is unable to grow on the characterized iron sources typical of this system, transferrin and lactoferrin (4A Vliet H.M.v. Ketley J.M. Park S.F. Penn C.W. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2002; 26: 173-186Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). C. jejuni can use ferrous iron, but disruption of feoB in C. jejuni, a putative ferrous uptake system characterized in Helicobacter pylori and E. coli, did not diminish 55Fe2+ uptake compared with the wild-type C. jejuni (36Raphael B.H. Joens L.A. Can. J. Microbiol. 2003; 49: 727-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Binding studies show a preference by cFbpA for ferrous iron as opposed to the free ferric form (Fig. 3A), suggesting that cFbpA may constitute a key component of a ferrous uptake system in C. jejuni. In addition, cFbpA may be involved in the acquisition of the ferric form bound to biological chelators such as oxalate. Within the cluster containing cFbpA (Fig. 4), four of five sequences are from pathogenic bacteria proposed to have an intracellular stage within the host. Members of this cluster include C. jejuni and Clostridium perfringens, for which the severity of infection is correlated with bacterial invasion (37Wooldridge K.G. Ketley J.M. Trends Microbiol. 1997; 5: 96-102Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 38O'Brien D.K. Melville S.B. Cell Microbiol. 2000; 2: 505-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). C. jejuni is proposed to have an intracellular stage during invasion into the epithelium of the gut (39Konkel M.E. Kim B.J. Rivera-Amill V. Garvis S.G. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 32: 691-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). C. perfringens, a Gram-positive anaerobe, is the causative agent of gas gangrene and has extensive invasive capacity (40Gorbach S.L. Schaechter M. Engleberg N.C. Eisenstein B.I. Medoff G. Mechanisms of Microbial Disease. 3rd Ed. Williams and Wilkins, Baltimore1999: 215-216Google Scholar). C. perfringens is proposed to exist within the cytoplasm of macrophages in the initial stage of infection (38O'Brien D.K. Melville S.B. Cell Microbiol. 2000; 2: 505-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The remaining members are from Ehrlichia chaffeensis and Wolbachia pipientis, which are obligate endocellular symbionts. The unique structural and functional properties of cFbpA suggest a novel role for these FbpAs in iron uptake from within a host intracellular environment. Ligand conservation is also observed within each of the different classes. Phylogenetic analyses of the Class III FbpAs show that the ligands are mainly conserved with few exceptions. One exception includes the FbpA homolog from Magnetospirillum gryphiswaldense that lacks the corresponding His14 and Tyr15 ligands because of a truncated N terminus. Also, in the FbpAs from Wolbachia and E. chaffeensis, the residues aligned with His14 and Tyr15 of cFbpA are Lys and Glu, indicating some change in iron ligation. The iron ligands observed within the crystal structures of Classes I and II are conserved absolutely among the sequences of their respective class members. Class IV–VI FbpAs likely coordinate iron differently than observed to date. The tree and conservation of known iron ligands suggest that Class IV FbpAs are similar to those from Class II; however, the residues in Class IV corresponding to those in the region around the carbonate anion in Class II are not conserved. Because of the limited number of members in Classes V and VI, only the two conserved tyrosines found across all classes can be readily identified as iron ligands. These two highly conserved tyrosines may then be used to construct a short sequence motif, (N/Y)XYY, to identify new FbpA family members. Although Asn200 is not absolutely conserved, because three of 41 FbpAs contain a Tyr substitution, this Tyr is present in the FbpA from Serratia marcescens, which is known to be involved in iron transport (41Angerer A. Klupp B. Braun V. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 1378-1387Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, despite the different iron sites between the classes, nearby tertiary interactions are conserved. Comparison of the iron-binding site of cFbpA with the other classes shows that six residues are conserved among all FbpAs with few exceptions, and all except Glu275 originate from the C-terminal domain (Fig. 1B, yellow; see also Table SIII). Only two of these residues are iron ligands (Tyr202 and Tyr203). Conserved residues Arg105 and Arg107 are near these tyrosines and likely lower the pKa of the phenolates to facilitate iron binding. Glu275 forms a conserved salt bridge to Arg105. In the available crystals structures, Asn200 seems to assist in iron binding by either forming an H-bond to a Tyr ligand (Class II and III FbpAs) or by interacting with the synergistic anion (Class I FbpAs). Among FbpAs from Classes II, III, and IV, additional cFbpA iron site residues are fully conserved (Arg13, Tyr146, Asp182, and Asn237) or mostly conserved (Asp63 and Arg140) (Fig. 1B, dark purple). Hydrogen bonding networks that surround the iron site are composed of these residues along with the six residues conserved in most FbpAs. H-bonds linking the N- and C-terminal domains are formed from four of these residues (Arg13 and Glu275; Asp63 and Asn237) and are conserved between these classes. Interestingly, in mFbpA the side chain equivalent to Arg13 in cFbpA is displaced to form a H-bond to the synergistic carbonate; thus, one of the two H-bonds to the carboxylate group of Glu275 present in cFbpA is lost in mFbpA (Fig. 1, B and D). These interdomain H-bond networks in the closed conformation are also maintained in Class I FbpAs using functionally equivalent residues (Fig. 1C). Interestingly, some bacteria contain multiple FbpAs (Fig. 4) spanning the different classes. Of the Class III cyanobacterial FbpAs, some are shown to function in iron uptake, whereas others have adapted the iron binding function for alternative purposes. For example, Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 contains three FbpAs, also known as IdiA homologs, two of which are members of Class III (S.sp1 and S.sp2), and one is in Class V (S.sp3). The best characterized is S.sp1 (annotated in the genome sequence as slr1295), which is cytoplasmic and is involved in protecting photosystem II during iron limitation and oxidative stress (42Michel L.-P. Pistorius E.K. Physiol. Plantarum. 2004; 120: 36-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Although the exact mechanism by which S.sp1 protects photosystem II is not known (42Michel L.-P. Pistorius E.K. Physiol. Plantarum. 2004; 120: 36-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), the iron binding properties are similar to other FbpAs (43Katoh H. Hagino N. Ogawa T. Plant Cell Physiol. 2001; 42: 823-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). In contrast, S.sp2 (slr0513) is secreted into the periplasm (42Michel L.-P. Pistorius E.K. Physiol. Plantarum. 2004; 120: 36-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 44Tolle J. Michel K.-P. Kruip J. Kahmann U. Preisfeld A. Pistorius E.K. Microbiology. 2002; 148: 3293-3305Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) and is likely a component of an iron uptake system (45Katoh H. Hagino N. Grossman A.R. Ogawa T. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 2779-2784Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). The sequences of both S.sp1 and S.sp2 have iron ligands conserved with those of cFbpA, suggesting similar iron coordination without a synergistic anion and mechanism of iron binding and release. The conservation of the iron site between Class III FbpAs from Campylobacter and the cyanobacteria offers precedence for an evolutionary model whereby iron binding was present before the incorporation of various synergistic anion-binding sites in other FbpAs. Cyanobacteria are believed to be the first oxygen-evolving phototrophic organisms and may therefore be primarily responsible for the global conversion from an anoxic to oxic atmosphere (46Blankenship R.E. Molecular Mechanisms of Photosynthesis. Blackwell Science Ltd., Malden2002Crossref Scopus (876) Google Scholar). These microorganisms may have been the first to adapt to a reduced bioavailability of iron because of the local oxidation of ferrous to ferric ions (42Michel L.-P. Pistorius E.K. Physiol. Plantarum. 2004; 120: 36-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Thus, cyanobacteria may have developed one of the first iron uptake systems linking ferrous and ferric uptake, a component of which may have resembled cFbpA. Because early microorganisms exchanged genetic material through extensive lateral gene transfer (46Blankenship R.E. Molecular Mechanisms of Photosynthesis. Blackwell Science Ltd., Malden2002Crossref Scopus (876) Google Scholar), this early iron uptake system may have been readily acquired and modified by other prokaryotes. In contrast, a previous model proposed that FbpAs shared a common anion binding ancestor (14Bruns C.M. Norwalk A.J. Arvai A.S. McTigue M.A. Vaughan K.G. Mietzner T.A. McRee D.E. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 919-924Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Our model for FbpA evolution, involving divergence from an anion-independent iron-binding protein ancestor, is more parsimonious.

Furthermore, these data show that it is important to discriminate between intact, inactive γ-secretase complexes and the active form of the enzyme, indicating the care that must be taken in the study of γ-secretase. γ-Secretase has been characterized as an unconventional aspartyl protease that processes type I membrane proteins after removal of their ectodomains by cleavage within their transmembrane domains. This enzyme has created great interest because it performs the final proteolytic cleavage step in the processing cascade of the β-amyloid precursor protein (βAPP). 1The abbreviations used are: βAPP, β-amyloid precursor protein; AD, Alzheimer's disease; Aβ, amyloid-β peptide; CHAPSO, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-2-hydroxy-1-propanesulfonate; CTF, C-terminal fragment; NTF, N-terminal fragment; MCD, methyl-β-cyclodextrin; MES, 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid; PS, presenilin; SEC, size exclusion chromatography; ER, endoplasmic reticulum. γ-Secretase cleavage leads to the production of amyloid-β (Aβ) peptides, which are generally believed to be the causative agents for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Because of its contribution to Aβ peptide production in the first instance and therefore to toxic events subsequently initiated by Aβ, inhibition of γ-secretase is also seen as a logical approach for the development of a disease-modifying treatment for this neurodegenerative condition. Extracellular clipping of βAPP by the aspartyl protease β-secretase (BACE1) (1.Vassar R. Bennett B.D. Babu-Khan S. Kahn S. Mendiaz E.A. Denis P. Teplow D.B. Ross S. Amarante P. Loeloff R. Luo Y.

It generates the β-C-terminal fragment (β-CTF, C99) that serves as a direct γ-secretase substrate. Alternatively, βAPP can be metabolized by cleavage within the Aβ domain, which is mediated by members of the disintegrin and metalloprotease family TACE (6.Buxbaum J.D. Liu K.N. Luo Y. Slack J.L.

This precludes Aβ peptide production, and the remaining membrane-bound fragment (α-CTF, C83) is cleaved by γ-secretase to release a small peptide termed p3. Overwhelming evidence for a key role of the two highly homologous presenilins (PS) 1 and 2 in γ-secretase enzyme function has evolved from their original identification as the main gene loci for early-onset, familial AD (8.Rogaev E.I.

It therefore appears that the association and maturation of these cofactors, along with the activation of the mature complex, possibly through PS endoproteolysis is an ordered and highly regulated process. To study this enzyme further, we have generated a novel cell line referred to as γ(NRC-F8)-secretase cell line, by sequentially co-expressing the substrate precursor βAPP695 and the complex components PS1, nicastrin, Aph-1aL, and Pen-2. This cell line displays the characteristics of a γ-secretase overexpressing in vitro system, manifested by changes in nicastrin maturation and PS1 endoproteolytic processing, an ∼14-fold increase in both cell-free γ(40)- and γ(42)-enzyme activities, and isolation of all components with the active site-directed (38.Wrigley J.D.

Confocal immunofluorescence microscopy provided insights into the regulation of enzyme trafficking to the cell surface and implied a protease-independent role of the functional γ-secretase complex in the regulation of the maturation and trafficking of βAPP. Size exclusion chromatography (SEC) and immunoaffinity isolation have been employed to provide evidence for a tetrameric enzyme species, highlight several key considerations in the purification of γ-secretase, and most significantly to demonstrate that lipids are critical for preservation of the active conformation of the enzyme complex. Antibodies—Monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies were obtained from the following sources and diluted for Western blot analyses as indicated: anti-β-catenin (monoclonal mouse, BD Biosciences, 1:1000), anti-FLAG (monoclonal mouse, Sigma, 1:5000), anti-V5 (monoclonal mouse, Invitrogen, 1:1000), anti-nicastrin (rabbit polyclonal, Sigma, 1:10,000), anti-α-tubulin (monoclonal mouse, Sigma, 1:5000), and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated polyclonal goat anti-mouse and anti-rabbit F(ab′)2 fragments (Amersham Biosciences, 1:5000).

Complementary DNA Constructs—Expression vectors encoding human nicastrin and Aph-1aL with a C-terminal V5-hexahistidine epitope tag were generated by assembling IMAGE clones (43.Lennon G. Auffray C. Polymeropoulos M. Soares M.B. Genomics. 1996; 33: 151-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (1089) Google Scholar) encoding the human sequences. Subcloning in the respective pcDNA vectors (Invitrogen) yielded the nicastrin-pcDNA3.1/Hygro(+) and Aph-1aL-pcDNA-3.1/V5-His/Neo(+) constructs that were confirmed by DNA sequencing. The generation of Pen-2-pcDNA3.1/FLAG/Neo(+) vector has been described (44.Bergman A. Hansson E. Pursglove S.E. Farmery M.R. Lannfelt L. Lendahl U. Lundkvist J. Naslund J. J. Biol.

For sequential introduction of additional γ-secretase complex components, the βAPP695/PS1 cell line (clone B9) was transfected with nicastrin-pcDNA3.1/Hygro(+) using standard calcium phosphate methods. Transfectants were cultured in the presence of 1 μg/ml puromycin (Sigma) and 100 μg/ml Zeocin (Invitrogen) to maintain βAPP and PS1 expression, respectively, and 500 μg/ml hygromycin (Invitrogen) to select for nicastrin expression (as determined from a kill curve carried out with the founder βAPP/PS1 cells). After dilution, individual surviving colonies were picked and screened for the expression of βAPP695, PS1, and nicastrin by Western blotting. The strongest nicastrin-overexpressing cell line (clone D8) was expanded for the next round of transfections. For this instance, Aph-1aL-pcDNA3.1/V5-His/Neo(+) and Pen-2-pcDNA3.1/FLAG/Neo(+) were transfected simultaneously into clone D8 using the Gene Juice transfection reagent (Novagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Transfectants were selected for expression of Aph-1aL and Pen-2 with 5 mg/ml of geneticin (Invitrogen) (as determined from a kill curve carried out with the founder βAPP/PS1/nicastrin cell line). After dilution, individual surviving colonies were picked and screened for the expression of all polypeptides by Western blotting. Clone F8, referred to as the γ(NRC-F8)-secretase cell line, was chosen for expansion because it showed the strongest expression of all exogenous polypeptides.

After blocking for 1 h at room temperature with 10% normal goat serum (Sigma), the cells were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with primary antiserum followed by a fluorophore-conjugated secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch). For co-immunostaining, the cells were further incubated with a second primary and secondary antibody conjugated to an alternative fluorophore. The cells were washed with PBS and nuclei stained with TOTO-3 iodine for 30 s (Molecular Probes).

Biliary secretion of cholesterol along with bile salts and phosphatidylcholine (PC) is the only pathway of sterol clearance from the body (4Kuipers F. Oude Elferink R.P.J. Verkade H. Groen A.K. Subcell. Biochem. 1997; 28: 1053-1060Google Scholar). Uptake of sterols from HDL in the hepatocyte is partially independent of the processing of the HDL protein moiety. This so-called selective uptake is mediated largely by the scavenger receptor BI (SR-BI) at the basolateral membrane of hepatic cells (3Ji Y. Wang N. Ramakrishnan R. Sehayek E. Huszar D. Breslow J.L.

It has been proposed that endocytosis and recycling of the whole HDL particle occurs in hepatocytes and contributes to selective CE uptake (6Kambouris A.M. Roach P.D. Calvert G.D. Nestel P.J.

Recently, we demonstrated that the natural cholesterol analog dehydroergosterol (DHE) incorporated into fluorescent HDL is rapidly released from the lipoprotein at the basolateral membrane of polarized HepG2 cells (9Wu ̈stner D. Mondal M. Huang A. Maxfield F.R. J. Lipid Res. 2004; 45: 427-437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). This process required SR-BI but was not dependent on metabolic energy in contrast to uptake of the HDL particles. DHE was rapidly shuttled to the apical canalicular membrane of HepG2 cells by ATP-independent non-vesicular transport (9Wu ̈stner D. Mondal M. Huang A. Maxfield F.R. J. Lipid Res. 2004; 45: 427-437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 10Wu ̈stner D. Herrmann A. Hao M. Maxfield F.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 30325-30336Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The canalicular membrane of HepG2 cells forms apical closed vacuoles that resemble the biliary canaliculi (BC) of hepatocytes in many respects (11Sormunen R. Eskelinen S. Lehto V.P. Lab. Investig. 1993; 68: 652-662PubMed Google Scholar). We found evidence for internalization of DHE and fluorescent PC from the BC of HepG2 cells (10Wu ̈stner D. Herrmann A. Hao M. Maxfield F.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 30325-30336Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 12Wu ̈stner D. Mukherjee S. Maxfield F.R. Mu ̈ller P. Hermann A. Traffic. 2001; 2: 277-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). We demonstrated that fluorescent PC and DHE become delivered to a subapical compartment or apical recycling compartment (SAC/ARC) in vesicles in 15–30 min. The identity of this SAC/ARC was shown by colocalization with fluorescent transferrin (Tf) as well as fluorescent sphingomyelin, a marker for lipid transcytosis in polarized HepG2 cells (10Wu ̈stner D. Herrmann A. Hao M. Maxfield F.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 30325-30336Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 13van Ijzendoorn S.C. Hoekstra D. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 683-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). By labeling HDL with the fluorescent dye Alexa-488 (Alexa-488-HDL) and employing quantitative fluorescence microscopy, we demonstrated rapid internalization and recycling of fluorescent HDL at the basolateral membrane of polarized HepG2 cells. Alexa-488-HDL became internalized into Tf-containing vesicles and accumulated in the SAC/ARC within 10 min. About 50–80% of Alexa-488-HDL rapidly recycled and became released from the cells. About 3% of initial Alexa-488-HDL were exported to the BC within a 30-min chase, whereas about 2% were found in late endosomes and lysosomes (LE/LYS) after prolonged incubation (9Wu ̈stner D. Mondal M. Huang A. Maxfield F.R. J. Lipid Res. 2004; 45: 427-437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). By quantitative fluorescence imaging we were able to measure detailed time courses of HDL transport in HepG2 cells. From studies in hepatocyte couplets it has been suggested that HDL is bound to SR-BI and the receptor-ligand complex accumulate in a SAC/ARC as we reported for HDL in polarized HepG2 cells (5Silver D.L. Wang N. Xiao X. Tall A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25287-25293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 9Wu ̈stner D. Mondal M. Huang A. Maxfield F.R. J. Lipid Res. 2004; 45: 427-437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Thus, trafficking of HDL is intimately linked to transport of SR-BI. It can be expected that mechanisms underlying SR-BI expression and transport regulate also HDL transport in hepatic cells. Detailed understanding of the pathways and dynamics of transport of HDL in hepatic cells is of crucial importance to analyze the processing of HDL apoprotein and sterol in the intact organ. However, even if itineraries and kinetics of intracellular HDL transport are known, the connection between pathways and rate-limiting transport steps remain obscure. Mathematical modeling is a powerful tool to analyze intracellular transport, once transport kinetics to cellular compartments have been determined. Here, a detailed mathematical analysis of intrahepatic HDL transport based on our previous measurements in polarized HepG2 cells has been performed (9Wu ̈stner D. Mondal M. Huang A. Maxfield F.R. J. Lipid Res. 2004; 45: 427-437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). A model was developed which predicts that most HDL is recycled from basolateral sorting endosomes (SE) while a portion is exported to the BC via the SAC/ARC. Analytical solutions for a 4-compartment model were derived and fitted simultaneously to the experimental data for transport of fluorescent HDL to the BC, to the SAC/ARC as well as to LE/LYS. Apical endocytosis of HDL and transport to LE/LYS was included in the model based on experimental results on targeting of lysosomal markers from the BC to LE/LYS in HepG2 cells. In addition endocytosis from the BC was directly visualized by time-lapse imaging of a fluorescent lipid probe in living HepG2 cells. Rate constants for all HDL transport steps are provided and used in a Monte Carlo simulation. The model for HDL transport was applied to determine the extent of SR-BI-mediated sterol release from the HDL particles based on quantitative trafficking data for HDL-associated DHE in HepG2 cells. Reagents—NBD-labeled PC 1-palmitoyl-2-[6-[(7-nitro-2–1,3-benzooxadiazol-4-y)amino]caproyl]-sn-glycero-3-phosphatidylcholine (C6-NBD-PC) was obtained from Avanti Polar Lipids (Birmingham, AL). 1,1′-didodecyl-3,3,3′,3′-tetramethylindocarbocyanine perchlorate (DiIC12), rhodamine-labeled dextran (70 kDa) (Rh-dextran) and Alexa-488 were purchased from Molecular Probes Inc. Medium 1 contained 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 5 mm glucose, and 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.4). Rh-dextran was dissolved in phosphate-buffered saline and repeatedly dialyzed before use to remove unconjugated dye. Fetal calf serum and Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium were from Invitrogen Life Technologies, Inc. All other chemicals were from Sigma. Tf was iron-loaded as described previously (14Yamashiro D.J. Tycko B. Fluss S.R. Maxfield F.R. Cell. 1984; 37: 789-800Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). Succinimidyl ester of Alexa-546 were then conjugated to the iron-loaded Tf following the manufacturer's instructions. TexasRed-labeled Asialoorosomucoid (TxRed-ASOR) was kindly provided by Dr. Allan Wolkoff (Albert Einstein College of Medicine, New York). Cell Culture and Labeling—HepG2 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 4.5 g/liter glucose, supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum and antibiotics. Cells were routinely passaged in plastic tissue culture dishes. For experiments, cells were plated onto glass coverslips coated with poly-d-lysine and used after reaching the highest degree of polarization as described previously (12Wu ̈stner D. Mukherjee S. Maxfield F.R. Mu ̈ller P. Hermann A. Traffic. 2001; 2: 277-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). To label the BC and study apical endocytosis, HepG2 cells were incubated with 2.5 mg/ml Rh-dextran for 1 h at 37 °C, washed, chased for different times, and imaged. Alternatively, cells were prelabeled with 4 μm C6-NBD-PC to identify BC, washed, and incubated with 5 μg/ml TexRed-ASOR for 10 min at 37 °C. Cells were washed and chased for 5, 20, or 60 min at 37 °C before imaging. Preparation of C6-NBD-PC labeling solution was exactly as described (12Wu ̈stner D. Mukherjee S. Maxfield F.R. Mu ̈ller P.

Cells were labeled with DiIC12 for 1 min at 37 °C, washed, and immediately placed on a temperature-controlled microscope stage maintained at 36 ± 1 °C of a wide-field microscope. Images were acquired either every 1 min for a total time of 30 min or every 10 s for a total time of 10 min. The microscope table was floated with nitrogen in order to prevent focal shifts during image acquisition. In some experiments, cells were colabeled with 5 μg/ml Alexa-488-Tf and DiIC12 for 1 min at 37 °C. Cells were washed and chased in the presence of Alexa-488-Tf for 1, 15, or 30 min at 37 °C. Cells were washed and imaged as described below. Fluorescence Microscopy and Image Analysis—Wide-field fluorescence microscopy and digital image acquisition were routinely carried out using a Leica DMIRB microscope with a ×63, 1.4 NA oil immersion objective (Leica Lasertechnik GmbH, Wetzlar, Germany) equipped with a Princeton Instruments cooled CCD camera driven by Image-1/MetaMorph Imaging System software. Rh-dextran, TexRed-ASOR and DiIC12 were imaged using a standard rhodamine filter set (535-nm, (50-nm bandpass) excitation filter, 565-nm longpass dichromatic filter, and 610-nm (75-nm) bandpass) emission filter) while C6-NBD-PC was imaged using a standard fluorescein filter set (470-nm, (20-nm bandpass) excitation filter, 510-nm longpass dichromatic filter, and 537-nm (23-nm) bandpass) emission filter). Fluorescence of Rh-dextran, TexRed-ASOR, and DiIC12 in the BC was quantified by defining regions of interest (ROI) for this compartment. In the case of Rh-dextran and DiIC12 integrated fluorescence intensity in ROI was measured after background subtraction and normalized to total cell-associated fluorescence in the two cells forming a BC. The ratio R(t) of the integrated fluorescence intensity of ROI (IROI(t)) and of whole cells (Icell(t)) was then calculated and plotted as function of time as described (9Wu ̈stner D. Mondal M.

Traffic. 2001; 2: 277-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). For TexRed-ASOR mean fluorescence in the BC was determined and plotted as function of total chase time (labeling + chase). Data Analysis—BC-associated fluorescence of Rh-dextran, TexRed-ASOR, and DiIC12 was evaluated and plotted using SigmaPlot 4.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL). The equations for the HDL transport model were used to derive rate constants for transport of HDL between various compartments. Curve-fitting of these equations was done by a multicompartment nonlinear regression procedure implemented in the SAAM software (SAAM Institute Inc., Seattle, WA). Data for transport of Alexa-488-HDL to the SAC/ARC and the BC were fitted simultaneously to the model solutions (see Appendices A and B) using the relative data weighting option. Based on the covariance matrix of estimated parameters it is possible to generate sets of random kinetic parameters, which follow a normal distribution Φ(x→) according to Equation 1. ϕ(x→)=p⋅exp(−12⋅(x→−a→)T⋅B⋅(x→−a→))(Eq. 1) Here, a→ is the vector of actuarial expectations of the kinetic parameters (i.e. elements of a→ are the parameters estimated by the non-linear regression), and B is the inverse of the symmetrical covariance matrix. The kinetic parameters M and k2 – k6 form the vector x→. Employing a Cholesky-decomposition B = DT · D and by replacing u→=D⋅(x→−a→), it is possible to obtain random vectors of kinetic parameters x→ from normal distributed elements ui of the vector u→ after back-transformation according to Equation 2.x→=D−1⋅u→+a→(Eq. 2) Random vectors are generated using a Monte Carlo simulation as described (16Brandt S. Datenanalyse. Spektrum Akademischer Verlag, Heidelberg, Berlin1999: 65-77Google Scholar). A program was written in Fortran code, which allows one to perform a Monte Carlo simulation of the obtained model solutions based on the sets of simulated kinetic parameters (16Brandt S.

Modeling Supports Sequential Transport of Fluorescent HDL in Polarized HepG2 Cells—Previously we could show that about 50–80% of initially bound Alexa-488-HDL recycle rapidly to the basolateral membrane of polarized HepG2 cells (9Wu ̈stner D. Mondal M. Huang A. Maxfield F.R. J. Lipid Res. 2004; 45: 427-437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Some fluorescent HDL was transported to the SAC/ARC whereas, with a lag-time, Alexa-488-HDL was also found in the BC (see Introduction). To model intrahepatic transport of HDL based on this kinetic data two assumptions have been made: (i) internalized fluorescent HDL was targeted from the basolateral membrane to SE from where rapid recycling occurred, (ii) some HDL escaping the recycling pathway was transcytosed to the BC and/or targeted to the SAC/ARC. From the data it could be concluded that transport of HDL from basolateral SE to the SAC/ARC and the BC, respectively, occurs either sequentially, i.e. HDL traverses the SAC/ARC before being targeted to the BC, or in parallel to both compartments. To distinguish between these possibilities two models were derived in the following paragraph and fitted to the experimental time courses as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Transport of HDL to LE/LYS was not taken into account for comparison of the sequential and parallel transport models but was included later (see below). Because of the low number of data points in the measured transport kinetics of HDL and some uncertainty in the definition of various endosome populations in hepatic cells, a realistic trafficking model should contain as few kinetic parameters as possible (18Tuma P.L. Finnegan C.M. Yi J.H. Hubbard A.L. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 1089-1102Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). (a) Sequential Model of Transcytosis—The sequential model shown in Fig. 1A gives the following system of differential equations with basolateral membrane (c1), SE (c2), SAC/ARC (c3), and BC (c4) in Equations 3,4, 5, 6. dc1dt=−k1⋅c1+k−1⋅c2(Eq. 3) dc2dt=k1⋅c1−(k−1+k2)⋅c2(Eq. 4) dc3dt=k2⋅c2−k3⋅c3(Eq. 5) dc4dt=k3⋅c3(Eq. 6) The rapid equilibrium approximation (REA), which makes the assumption that uptake and recycling of HDL is much faster than export of HDL from SE to the SAC/ARC was applied (19Heinrich R. Schuster S. The Regulation of Cellular Systems. Chapman & Hall, New York1996: 123-134Google Scholar). This gives Equations 7 and 8. c2c1=k1k−1=q(Eq. 7) c1=k−1⋅c2k1 and c2=k1⋅c1k−1(Eq. 8) When c1+c2 = M equals the amount of HDL in the basolateral membrane, and SE after an initial short time span c1(≥0) and c2(≥0) can be calculated with Equation 9, M=c1+k1⋅c1k−1=k−1+k1k−1⋅c1(Eq. 9) to Equation 10. c1(≥0)=M⋅k−1k−1+k1 and c2(≥0)=M⋅k1k−1+k1(Eq. 10) Because of the rapid equilibration between c1 and c2 and using Equation 8 (left) one will obtain Equation 11. d(c1+c2)dt=d(k−1k1⋅c2+c2)dt=d(k−1+k1k1⋅c2)dt=−k2⋅c2(Eq. 11) The differential Equation 4 for c2(t) will therefore be as shown in Equation 12. dc2dt=−k1⋅k2k−1+k1⋅c2=q⋅k2q+1⋅c2(Eq. 12) The differential equation system consisting of Equations 5, 6, and 12 was solved with the initial conditions c2(0) = (M · q)/(1 + q), c3(0) = c4(0) = 0 as described in “Appendix A.” (b) Parallel Model of Transcytosis—The parallel model shown in Fig. 1B gives the following system of differential equations (Equations 13, 14, 15) in addition to Equation 3 with the same notation of compartments as described above. dc2dt=k1⋅c1−(k−1+k2+k3)⋅c2(Eq. 13) dc3dt=k2⋅c2(Eq. 14) dc4dt=k3⋅c2(Eq. 15) Because of the rapid equilibration between c1 and c2 as described in Equations 3 and 7, 8, 9, 10, we obtain Equation 16. dc2dt=−k1⋅(k2+k3)k−1+k1⋅c2=−q⋅(k2+k3)q+1⋅c2(Eq. 16) The system consisting of Equations 14, 15, 16 was solved as described in “Appendix A.” Simultaneous fitting to all measured compartments was required in order to obtain reliable regression for this multiparameter model despite the low number of data points for each individual compartment. To further reduce the number of free parameters, q = 0.5 was set, which means that rapid recycling of HDL from SE is twice as fast as basolateral internalization of the lipoprotein (see Equation 7). This is in accordance with available endocytic trafficking data (see below) (20Hao M. Maxfield F.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15279-15286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 21Sheff D.R. Daro E.A. Hull M. Mellman I. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 123-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). Sequential but not parallel transport clearly fits the data including the decrease in fluorescence of HDL in the SAC/ARC between a 10- and 30-min chase (Fig. 1C). Fluorescence increase in the BC showed some lag time, which can be well described by the sigmoid line from the sequential model. This lag phase is not in accordance with the parallel transport model (Fig. 1D). The sequential model predicts that the concentration of HDL in the SAC/ARC decreases to zero for prolonged chase. In the parallel model the concentration of HDL in the SAC/ARC should be constant. To test these hypothesizes the experimentally measured time courses for Alexa-488-HDL in the SAC/ARC were combined for short (1 min) and long (10 min) pulse experiments (Fig. 1, E and F) (9Wu ̈stner D. Mondal M. Huang A. Maxfield F.R. J. Lipid Res. 2004; 45: 427-437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). After an initial rise the concentration of HDL in the SAC/ARC, reflected by fluorescence intensity of Alexa-488-HDL, decreased to almost background values after a 30- to 60-min chase. This is in accordance with the sequential but not with the parallel model (Fig. 1, E and F). Next, the time courses were simulated using the estimated parameters for the sequential and parallel transport model (Fig. 2, A and B). According to the sequential model, simulated fractional fluorescence of Alexa-488-HDL rises, like found in experiments, first in the SAC/ARC (dark gray line) and with a lag time in the BC (light gray line) (Fig. 2A). In case of the sequential model, kinetic parameters obtained from the multicompartment regression using SAAM II (SAAM Institute Inc., Seattle, WA) have a much lower standard deviation and coefficient of variance than those obtained for the parallel model (Fig. 2, C–F). This further argues for the sequential model but against the parallel model. Together, these results suggest that transport of fluorescent HDL from the basolateral membrane to the BC occurs by transit through the SAC/ARC but not in parallel to both compartments. Validation of the Rapid Equilibrium Approach for HDL Recycling from Sorting Endosomes—It is important to validate the suitability of the REA for modeling HDL transport in hepatic cells. This can be done by comparing the solutions for the sequential model using the REA with those obtained from the original system without any system simplifying assumptions (called the complete sequential model). The differential equation system for the complete sequential model was solved (see Equations 3, 4, 5, 6 and “Appendix B”), and the time course was simulated (Fig. 3). The internalization and recycling rates (k1 and k–1) were obtained from the literature: As shown for various cell types half-times of uptake from the plasma membrane and rapid recycling from SE are in the order of t½ = 2 min and t½ = 1 min, respectively (20Hao M. Maxfield F.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15279-15286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Thus, for comparing both model solutions, the rates were set to k1 = 0.35 min–1 and k1– = 0.7 min–1. It is important to note that these values satisfy the condition q = 0.5 from the REA used for fitting the sequential model with REA to the data (see Fig. 1 and above). In Fig. 3A it is demonstrated that the time course for simulated fluorescence of Alexa-488-HDL in SE using the REA differs only for the first 2 min from the simulated time course of the complete sequential model in the SE Using the complete sequential model a rapid initial rise for the simulated kinetics of HDL transport to SE was found (light gray line in Fig. 3A). After this short time span the time course of HDL transport from SE is very well approximated by the sequential model using the REA (black line in Fig. 3A). This is further validated by the phase plot showing fluorescence of Alexa-488-HDL in the basolateral membrane obtained with the complete sequential model (c1(t)) versus both solutions for the SE compartment (c2(t)) (Fig. 3B) (19Heinrich R. Schuster S. The Regulation of Cellular Systems. Chapman & Hall, New York1996: 123-134Google Scholar). This plot gives approximately a straight line for the REA (black line), which closely matches the phase curve for the complete sequential model (gray line) for values of fractional fluorescence of Alexa-488-HDL in the basolateral membrane of up to 0.05. Only for larger values of c1(t) both curves deviate, which reflects the first 2 min of simulation (compare Fig. 3A). Next the simulated time courses of fractional fluorescence of Alexa-488-HDL in the SAC/ARC and BC, respectively, were compared for the sequential model with REA and the complete sequential model (Fig. 3, C and D). Employing the REA has almost no impact on the simulated kinetics of HDL transport to both compartments. In other words, using the REA will only minimally affect the estimated kinetic parameters obtained from the regression of the model to the experimental time courses of fluorescence of Alexa-488-HDL in the SAC/ARC and BC, respectively. It can be concluded that the REA is a valid assumption for modeling HDL transport in polarized HepG2 cells. Previously we determined a rate constant of k = 0.1 min–1 (t½ = 6.9 min) for release of Alexa-488-HDL from HepG2 cells after 1 min of pulse labeling of cells with the lipoprotein (9Wu ̈stner D. Mondal M. Huang A. Maxfield F.R. J. Lipid Res. 2004; 45: 427-437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). At first glance, this might argue against rapid recycling with an approximative half-time of 1 min for fluorescent HDL from HepG2 cells (compare Fig. 3 and see above). Rate constants for at 4 °C) and dissociation (k– = association (k+ = 0.818 min–1 0.048 min–1 at 4 °C) of HDL on HepG2 cells have been measured previously (22Guendouzi K. Collet X. Perret B. Chap H. Barbaras R. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 14974-14980Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). A numerical simulation of the complete sequential model (see “Appendix B” and above) with an additional binding/release step for HDL on HepG2 cells using those rate constants gives a half-time for the release process of t½ ≅ 8 min and a plateau value of cell-associated fluorescence of labeled HDL of 70% of initial (not shown). Here, the assumption was made that initially all fluorescent HDL is bound to the cell surface, i.e. in the basolateral plasma membrane (c1(0), see Equation 3) mimicking the experimental conditions from our previous study (9Wu ̈stner D. Mondal M. Huang A. Maxfield F.R. J. Lipid Res. 2004; 45: 427-437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Since in our pulse experiment at 37 °C, association and dissociation might be faster than at 4 °C, the observed half-time of release of Alexa-488-HDL from HepG2 cells in our previous experiments of t½ = 6.9 min is in good agreement with those binding values (9Wu ̈stner D. Mondal M. Huang A. Maxfield F.R. J. Lipid Res. 2004; 45: 427-437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 22Guendouzi K. Collet X. Perret B. Chap H. Barbaras R.

In this study, the HPFH phenotype was reestablished in transgenic mice carrying the μ′LCRAγ–175ψβδβ construct, which contained a 3.1-kb μ′LCR cassette linked to a 29-kb fragment from the Aγ-to β-globin gene with the natural chromosome arrangement but with the –175 mutation, which provided evidence for this single mutation as the cause of this form of HPFH. The HPFH phenotype was also reproduced in transgenic mice carrying the μ′LCRAγ–173ψβδβ construct, in which the –175 T to C Aγ gene was substituted with the –173 T to C Aγ gene. In vitro experiments proved that the –175 mutation significantly reduced binding of Oct-1 but not GATA-1, whereas the –173 mutation dramatically decreased binding of GATA-1 but not Oct-1. These results suggest that abrogation of either GATA-1 or Oct-1 binding to this promoter region may result in the HPFH phenotype. An in vivo footprinting assay revealed that either the –175 mutation or the –173 mutation significantly decreased overall protein binding to this promoter region in adult erythrocytes of transgenic mice. We hypothesize that a multiprotein complex containing GATA-1, Oct-1, and other protein factors may contribute to the formation of a repressive chromatin structure that silences γ-globin gene expression in normal adult erythrocytes.

The human fetal globin genes (Gγ and Aγ) are mainly expressed in fetal liver. The switch from fetal to adult (δ and β) globin gene expression occurs in the perinatal period concomitantly with the establishment of the bone marrow as the main site of erythropoiesis. In some individuals, however, this switching is incomplete, and γ-globin expression persists in adult erythrocytes. Such a condition, found in syndromes of hereditary persistence of fetal hemoglobin (HPFH) 1The abbreviations used are: HPFH, hereditary persistence of fetal hemoglobin; LCR, locus control region; MEL, mouse erythroleukemia; DMS, dimethylsulfate; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation; LM-PCR, ligation-mediated PCR. and (δβ)0-thalassemias, can result from deletions within the β-globin gene cluster (1Stamatoyannopoulos G. Grosveld F. Stamatoyannopoulos G. Majerus P. Peelmutter R. The Molecular Basis of Blood Diseases. 3rd ed. W. B. Saunders, Philadelphia2001: 135-182Google Scholar). However, in some syndromes known as non-deletion HPFH, point mutations in the γ-globin gene promoter seem to be responsible for the continuance of γ-globin expression (1Stamatoyannopoulos G. Grosveld F. Stamatoyannopoulos G. Majerus P. Peelmutter R. The Molecular Basis of Blood Diseases. 3rd ed. W. B. Saunders, Philadelphia2001: 135-182Google Scholar). It has been revealed that most of the point mutations lie in or near the trans-acting factor binding motifs within the promoter and that the mutations usually affect the binding of some trans-acting factors in vitro (2Forget B.G. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1998; 850: 38-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Studies in transgenic mice carrying either –117 Aγ HPFH cosmid or –117 Aγ HPFH yeast artificial chromosome showed that transgenic expression could mimic the developmental expression program observed in HPFH, providing powerful proof that the single point mutation was the cause of the Greek form of HPFH (3Berry M. Grosveld F. Dillon N.A. Nature. 1992; 358: 449-502Crossref Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 4Peterson K.R. Li Q.L. Clegg C.H. Furukawa T. Navas P.A. Norton E.J. Kimbrough T.G. Stamatoyannopoulos G. Proc.

Nature. 1992; 358: 449-502Crossref Scopus (111) Google Scholar) speculated that this change of γ-globin expression during development could be correlated with the loss of GATA-1 binding to the γ-promoter region around –117 and deduced that GATA-1 might act as a negative regulator of the γ-globin gene in normal adults. However, earlier in vitro experiments on a black form of HPFH point mutation, a T to C substitution at position –175 of the γ-globin promoter, showed no significant difference in the GATA-1 affinity for the promoter. Nevertheless, this mutation dramatically decreased the affinity of the Oct-1 transcription factor, which binds to an area partially overlapping the GATA-1 binding site (5Gumucio D.L. Rood K.L.

To test whether the –175 T to C substitution might be the cause of the black form of HPFH, we introduced two β-globin minilocus constructs into mice. The first was μ′LCRAγψβδβ, which contained a 3.1-kb μ′LCR cassette linked to a 29-kb fragment from the Aγ- to β-globin gene with the natural chromosome arrangement. The second was μ′LCRAγ–175ψβδβ, which was similar to μ′LCRAγψβδβ except for a T to C substitution at position –175 of the Aγ promoter. Normal developmental expression of γ- and β-globin genes was observed in transgenic mouse lines with μ′LCRAγψβδβ, whereas persistent expression of the γ-globin gene in adults of transgenic mouse lines with μ′LCRAγ–175ψβδβ was noted, suggesting that this single mutation is responsible for the HPFH phenotype. To further investigate the relationship between GATA-1 or Oct-1 binding and the developmental regulation of the γ-globin gene, we substituted the –175 T to C Aγ-globin gene with a –173 T to C Aγ-globin gene in the construct. The –173 T base has been reported to be involved in the conserved GATA-1 binding motif (5Gumucio D.L. Rood K.L. Gray T.A. Riordan M.F. Sartor C.I. Collins F.S. Mol. Cell.

By electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs), we found that the –173 mutation decreased GATA-1 binding dramatically but reduced Oct-1 binding only slightly. Despite these differences in transcription factor binding ability, the HPFH phenotype was reestablished in mice carrying μ′LCRAγ–173ψβδβ. These results suggested that the inability of either the GATA-1 or Oct-1 to bind this promoter region could result in the HPFH phenotype. We then tested the protein binding status within this promoter region in adult erythrocytes of mice carrying normal or mutant γ-globin genes by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and in vivo footprint analysis. The results show that either the –175 or the –173 mutation significantly decreased protein binding to both the GATA-1 and Oct-1 binding sites in adult erythrocytes of transgenic mice. Taken together, these results suggest that the GATA-1 and Oct-1 might act together as part of a repressor complex that silences γ-globin gene expression in normal adult erythrocytes and that abrogation of binding by either disrupted the repressor complex and resulted in HPFH. Cosmid Constructs—The plasmid pμ′LCR, containing a 3.1-kb cassette consisting of the intact core sequences of HS1–4, is a gift from Dr. Q. Li. The cosmid construct μLCRAγψβδβ (10Enver T. Natacha R. Ebens A.J. Papauannopoulou T. Costantini F. Stamatoyannopoulos G. Nature. 1990; 344: 309-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar) is a gift from Dr. G. Stamatoyannopoulos. The 3.1-kb μ′LCR was released as a HindIII fragment from pμ′LCR and inserted into pBAγ that contained a 3.3-kb HindIII fragment with Aγ-globin gene and flanking sequences, generating pμ′LCRAγ. A XhoI-NotI fragment, which contained the 3.1-kb μ′LCR, the promoter, and a 5′ part of the Aγ-globin gene, was released from pμ′LCRAγ and replaced the initial XhoI-NotI fragment of cosmid μLCRAγψβδβ, generating cosmid μ′LCRAγψβδβ (Fig. 1). An engineered T to C substitution at position –175 was introduced into the 0.7-kb ApaI fragment of plasmid pBAγ by PCR and then inserted back into the parental plasmid pBAγ, generating plasmid pBAγ–175. The mutation was confirmed by DNA sequencing. Subsequently, the mutated HindIII-XhoI fragment of plasmid pBAγ–175 was linked to the 3.1-kb μ′LCR cassette and then inserted as an XhoI-NotI fragment back into the μ′LCRAγψβδβ, generating construct μ′LCRAγ–175ψβδβ (Fig. 1). Similar strategies were adopted to create construct μ′LCRAγ–173ψβδβ (Fig. 1). DNA Purification for Microinjection—The 35-kb KpnI-NotI DNA fragments, with and without the point mutations, were released from the cosmid constructs (Fig. 1) and purified by centrifugation through NaCl gradients (11Fink P.S. BioTechniques. 1991; 10: 447-449Google Scholar). Gradient solutions were prepared by diluting 25% (w/v) NaCl (S-5886; Sigma) in 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 5 mm EDTA. Digested DNA was diluted with water to a total volume of 2 ml and then gently layered on the gradient solution. Tubes (Beckman SW40 Ti) were centrifuged at 25,000 rpm (80,000 × g) at 20 °C for 18 h. After centrifugation, an 18-gauge needle was inserted into the bottom of the tube, and 9 drops (∼500 μl) were collected per fraction. Aliquots of 10 μl from each fraction were mixed with 10 μl of water and DNA loading buffer, and the samples were loaded onto an agarose gel. After electrophoresis, the ethidium bromide-stained gel was viewed, and fractions containing only the desired band were identified and pooled. The pooled fractions were desalted with the aid of NAP-10 columns (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with microinjection buffer (0.22-μm filtered 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 0.1 mm EDTA). The desalted pool was centrifuged for 1 h at 10,000 × g, and all but 100 μl of the centrifuged fractions at the bottom were transferred to a clean tube (12Wall R.J. Paleyanda R.K. Foster J.A. Powell A. Rexroad C. Lubon H. Anim. Biotechnol. 2000; 11: 19-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). An aliquot was used to determine DNA concentration by UV absorbance with a spectrophotometer. The transgenes were diluted with microinjection buffer to a final concentration of 0.2 ng/μl. Production of Transgenic Mice and DNA Analysis—Purified DNA fragments were injected into the pronuclei of KM fertilized eggs and then transferred to KM pseudopregnant foster mothers (13Hogan B. Beddongton R. Costantini F. Lacy E. Manipulating the Mouse Embryo: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1994Google Scholar). Transgenic mice were identified by PCR and Southern blot analysis of tail skin DNA. Transgenic founder mice were bred with nontransgenic KM mates to establish transgenic lines. The structures of the integrated constructs were analyzed by Southern blot hybridization, using the γ- and the β-globin gene and the μ′LCR as the probes. Copy numbers were determined by comparing the intensity of hybridization bands from the transgenic lines with that of human genomic DNA by PhosphorImager analysis. Globin Gene Expression Analysis—For each mouse line, transgenic males were mated with nontransgenic KM females to generate timed pregnancies. The morning when the mating plug was observed was designated day 0.5. RNA samples were prepared from the yolk sac of mouse embryos on day 11.5; from fetal livers on days 13.5, 16.5, and 18.5; and from the blood of newborn pups as well as adult animals (9Starck B.J. Sarkar R. Romana M. Bhargava A. Scarpa A.L. Tanaka M. Chamberlain J.W. Weissman S.M. Blood. 1994; 84: 1656-1665Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Total RNA was isolated with TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Human and murine globin RNAs were analyzed by quantitative RNase protection assays (14Zhang J.W. Stamatoyannopoulos G. Chin. Med. Sci. J. 1999; 14: 31-37PubMed Google Scholar). Four plasmids containing the pT7 promoter and a fragment of each of the four globin genes were used as probe templates: 1) pT7Aγ, made by cloning a NcoI-PvuII fragment of the human Aγ-globin gene into pBluescript and linearized with BstEII, giving a protected fragment of 170 nucleotides derived from exon 2 of the human Aγ mRNA; 2) pT7β, made by inserting a BamHI-BalI fragment of the human β-globin in pGEM and linearized with BsaI, giving a protected fragment of 205 nucleotides derived from exon 2 of the human β mRNA; 3) pT7Mα, made by inserting a PstI-BamHI fragment, corresponding to the 5′ end of mouse α-globin gene, into pBSks and linearized with HindIII, giving a protected fragment of 128 nucleotides derived from exon 1 of the mouse α mRNA; and 4) pT7Mζ, made by cloning a mouse ζ gene AvaII-XbaI fragment into pBluescript and linearized with EcoRI, giving a protected fragment of 151 nucleotides. The RNA probes labeled with [α-32P]UTP were obtained by in vitro transcription of the plasmids with pT7 polymerase. 10 μg of total RNA was hybridized overnight at 47 °C with 1 × 106 cpm of each probe, followed by digestion with RNase A and T1 for 30 min at 37 °C using the ribonuclease protection assay kit (Roche Applied Science). The protected fragments were separated on 5% acrylamide/8 m urea gel and autoradiographed. The intensities of protected fragments were quantitated using the Amersham Biosciences PhosphorImager. EMSA—Human erythroleukemia K562 cells, mouse erythroleukemia (MEL) cells (MELGM979 and MEL585), and human cervical carcinoma cells (HeLa) were cultured as described previously (5Gumucio D.L. Rood K.L. Gray T.A. Riordan M.F. Sartor C.I. Collins F.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 5310-5322Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). In some experiments, K562 cells were induced to differentiate by the addition of 25 μm hemin to the medium for 4 days before nuclear isolation, and MEL cells were induced by the addition of 2% Me2SO to the medium for 2 days before nuclear isolation. The nuclear extracts were prepared, and EMSAs were carried out as described previously (5Gumucio D.L. Rood K.L. Gray T.A. Riordan M.F. Sartor C.I. Collins F.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 5310-5322Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The 44-bp ApaI-AvaII fragments (–201 to –158) of the γ-globin promoter with the normal sequence or the –175 or –173 mutation was used as probe. The probes were labeled with Klenow polymerase and [α-32P]dCTP (normal probe, 5′-GCTTCCCCACACTATCTCAATGCAAATATCTGTCTGAAACGGTC-3′; –173 mutation probe, 5′-GCTTCCCCACACTATCTCAATGCAAATACCTGTCTGAAACGGTC-3′; and –175 mutation probe, 5′-GCTTCCCCACACTATCTCAATGCAAACATCTGTCTGAAACGGTC-3′). The EMSAs were carried out as described previously (5Gumucio D.L. Rood K.L. Gray T.A. Riordan M.F. Sartor C.I. Collins F.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 5310-5322Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Binding reaction mixtures (20 μl) contained 20 mm HEPES, 60 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and 12% glycerol. 2 μg of nonspecific competitor DNA poly(dI-dC) was added to reduce nonspecific binding. 10 μg of nuclear extracts was added, and the reaction was incubated at 30 °C for 5 min before the addition of labeled probe (1 × 104 cpm, 1 ng). Complete binding reactions were incubated at 30 °C for 15 min. The sequences of competitors for GATA-1 and Oct-1 binding were 5′-CGAGGCAAGAGATATATCTTAGAGGGAGT-3′ and 5′-TGCTCATGAATATGCAAATCCTGTGTGTCT-3′ respectively. Electrophoresis was carried out at 25 °C in 4% polyacrylamide gels, using 0.5× Tris-borate EDTA buffer. The gels were then dried and analyzed by autoradiography. To assess quantitative differences in binding affinity, the intensities of retarded bands were determined by an LKB (Amersham Biosciences) UltroScan XL laser densitometer equipped with GelScan 2.1 software. ChIP and Ligation-mediated PCR (LM-PCR)—ChIP and LM-PCR were performed as described by Kang et al. (15Kang S.H. Vieira K. Bungert J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: e44Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), with the following modifications. Bone marrow cells (5 × 106) of the transgenic mice were cross-linked by adding formaldehyde to a final concentration of 1% and incubated at room temperature for 10 min. Cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and resuspended in ChIP lysis buffer (1% SDS, 10 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0) with protease inhibitors. After incubation on ice for 10 min, the cells were sonicated to shear DNA to lengths between 200 and 1000 bp on ice. The lysate was transferred to a 15-ml conical tube and diluted with dilution buffer (0.01% SDS, 1.1% Triton X-100, 1.2 mm EDTA, 16.7 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, 16.7 mm NaCl, and protease inhibitors). An aliquot of 500 μl of protein A-Sepharose beads was added to the diluted nuclear lysate and incubated at 4 °C for 2 h while rotating. The beads were pelletized at 2000 rpm for 10 min. The supernatant was divided into three aliquots of 25 μl. Anti-GATA-1 and anti-Oct-1 antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were added to two aliquots, respectively, whereas no antibody was added to the third aliquot, and then the aliquots were incubated at 4 °C overnight while rotating. Dimethylsulfate (DMS) treatment of the immunoprecipitated chromatin fragments was performed using the Maxam and Gilbert guanine-specific sequencing reaction with 0.1% DMS for 45 s at room temperature. An aliquot of the precipitated DNA was also analyzed by PCR with primers specific for the human γ-globin promoter region (forward primer, 5′-TGGAATGACTGAATCGGAAC-3′; reverse primer, 5′-GTGTGTGGAACTGCTGAAG-3′). Approximately 2 μg of DMS-treated DNA was annealed to 0.6 pmol of human γ-globin promoter specific primer 1 (5′-AACCTCAGACGTTCCAGAA-3′) by denaturing at 96 °C for 10 min, followed by annealing at 47 °C for 30 min. Primer extension was performed at 53 °C for 1 min, 55 °C for 1 min, 57 °C for 1 min, 60 °C for 1 min, 62 °C for 1 min, 66 °C for 1 min, 68 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 5 min. Ligation of the blunt end of the extension product with the linker pair (A′ and B) was performed at 16 °C overnight. After standard phenol/chloroform extractions and ethanol precipitation, the ligated DNA was resuspended in 30 μl of H2O. 18 amplification cycles were performed using the linker primer A′ and primer 2 (5′-GTGTGTGGAACTGCTGAAG-3′). The first cycle had a 3-min denaturing step at 95 °C, and the remaining denaturing steps were 1 min. All cycles had annealing steps at 55 °C for 2 min. The extension time began with 3 min and was increased by 5 s with each cycle at 72 °C. The 5′ end of a primer 3 (5′-GCTTCCTTTTATTCTTCATCCC-3′) was labeled with [γ-32P]ATP. A single-strand amplification of the PCR product was performed for 2 cycles using the labeled primer 3. The first cycle was initiated with denaturation at 95 °C for 3 min, and the second cycle was initiated with denaturation for 1 min. Annealing steps were carried out at 55 °C for 2 min, and the extension steps were carried out at 72 °C for 10 min. The products of the single-strand amplification were stored at 4 °C before running sequencing gel. Normal Developmental Expression of γ-Globin Gene Was Observed in Transgenic Mice with μ′LCRAγψβδβ—Two transgenic lines with intact integration of the construct μ′LCRAγψβδβ were established. The levels of human Aγ- and β-globin transcripts as well as endogenous mouse α- and ζ-globin transcripts were measured by RNase protection analysis (Fig. 2; Table I).Table IGlobin gene expression in transgenic mouse lines carrying μ′LCRAγψβδβLineDevelopmental ageCopy no.aCopy no., number of transgenes in haploid cell.Human γ mRNA/mouse α + ζ mRNA/copy %bThree to four F2 animals were analyzed in each.Adult γ mRNA/peak fetal γ mRNAmean ± S.D.%dcd, days post-coitus. 11.511 ± 3.0d 13.517 ± 3.9N1d 16.5216 ± 4.32.3d 18.515 ± 2.8Newborn0.9 ± 0.5Adult0.4 ± 0.3d 11.59 ± 3.1d 13.516 ± 2.6N5d 16.5215 ± 2.71.8d 18.514 ± 2.0Newborn0.6 ± 0.2Adult0.3 ± 0.2a Copy no., number of transgenes in haploid cell.b Three to four F2 animals were analyzed in each.c d, days post-coitus. Open table in a new tab In line N1, the highest Aγ-globin mRNA detected was ∼17% of mouse α- plus ζ-globin mRNA (per transgene copy) on day 13.5, declining significantly to 0.9% in newborn pups and to 0.4% in adult animals. This result suggests active expression of the Aγ-globin gene during the fetal stages and subsequent silence after birth. The human β-globin gene was undetectable at the embryonic stage but became active in the early fetal liver, rising rapidly to maximum levels and remaining there in the adult stage. The pattern of developmental expression of human γ- and β-globin genes in line N5 was very similar to that in line N1. These results indicate that transgenic mice carrying μ′LCRAγψβδβ can mimic the normal developmental expression programs of both the human Aγ- and β-globin genes. This finding is similar to that from a previous study on transgenic mice carrying μLCRAγψβδβ, a construct that was the same as μ′LCRAγψβδβ except for the use of a 2.6-kb μLCR cassette (10Enver T. Natacha R. Ebens A.J. Papauannopoulou T. Costantini F. Stamatoyannopoulos G. Nature. 1990; 344: 309-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). The HPFH Phenotype Was Reproduced in Transgenic Mice Carrying μ′LCRAγ–175 ψβδβ—Four transgenic lines with intact integration of the construct μ′LCRAγ–175ψβδβ were established. The expression of the human and murine globin mRNAs during mouse development is shown in Fig. 3 and Table II.Table IIGlobin gene expression in transgenic mouse lines carrying μ′LCRAγ-175ψβδβLineDevelopmental ageCopy no.aCopy no., number of transgenes in haploid cell.Human γ mRNA/mouse α + ζ mRNA/copy %bThree to four F2 animals were analyzed in each.Adult γ mRNA/peak fetal γ mRNAmean ± S.D.%dcd, days post-coitus. 11.53 ± 2.6d 13.523 ± 1.0502d 16.5129 ± 1.328d 18.527 ± 1.6Newborn26 ± 8.4Adult8 ± 7.2d 11.54 ± 3.0d 13.521 ± 4.9506d 16.5119 ± 4.671d 18.520 ± 5.0Newborn17 ± 5.4Adult15 ± 1.3d 11.54 ± 2.5d 13.517 ± 4.2518d 16.5218 ± 0.567d 18.515 ± 0.7Newborn14 ± 0.9Adult12 ± 0.7d 11.53 ± 2.1d 13.518 ± 4.7d 16.517 ± 0.9523d 18.5215 ± 3.144Newborn8 ± 0.9Adult8 ± 0.7a Copy no., number of transgenes in haploid cell.b Three to four F2 animals were analyzed in each.c d, days post-coitus. Open table in a new tab The human γ/mouse α + ζ mRNA/copy ranged from 8% to15% in adults, only a moderate decline when compared with the highest Aγ-globin mRNA expression, which ranged from 18% to 29% in the fetal stage. That is, Aγ-globin gene expression in the adult stage was between 28% and 71% of the maximal fetal-stage expression. Although transgene expression varied between lines, the 29–72% reduction of γ-globin gene transcription in adult stage as compared with that in the fetal stage for mice carrying μ′LCRAγ–175ψβδβ differed significantly from the 97.7–98.2% reduction occurring in mice carrying μ′LCRAγψβδβ. These results demonstrated that the Aγ-globin gene with the –175 mutation still remained active during the adult stage and that the point mutation was responsible for the HPFH phenotype. The –175 and –173 Mutation Affected GATA-1 and Oct-1 Binding Differently in Vitro—The region from –170 to –190 of the Aγ-globin gene promoter contains two GATA-1 binding motifs and one Oct-1 binding motif (Fig. 4A). EMSAs of the normal ApaI-AvaII fragment (–201 to –158) of the γ-globin gene promoter and its –173 mutant counterpart were performed using nuclear extracts from uninduced and hemin-induced erythroid K562 cells, uninduced and Me2SO-induced erythroid MEL cells, as well as nonerythroid HeLa cells. Two MEL cell lines, MELGM979 (which expresses both adult and embryonic globins) and MEL585 (which expresses adult globin only), were used for nuclear extract preparation. Very similar EMSA profiles were observed between the two lines (data not shown). Two common mobility shifted bands (A and B) were produced when the normal fragment reacted with all the nuclear extracts, with the exception of the HeLa cell extract. (Fig. 4B). Compared with the normal probe, the intensity of band A, produced by the –173 mutation probe, decreased by 19 ± 10%, and the intensity of band B, produced by the same mutation probe, decreased by 85 ± 8%. The competition assay demonstrated that band A resulted from Oct-1 binding and that band B resulted from GATA-1 binding (Fig. 4C). This result indicated that the –173 mutation dramatically decreased the binding affinity of GATA-1 to the mutant promoter but only slightly reduced Oct-1 binding. EMSAs of DNA fragments with the –175 mutation have been carried out exhaustively in previous studies (5Gumucio D.L. Rood K.L. Gray T.A. Riordan M.F. Sartor C.I. Collins F.S. Mol. Cell.

Blood. 1994; 84: 1656-1665Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our results here showed that when compared with the normal fragment, the binding affinity of GATA-1 to the –175 mutation promoter decreased by 5 ± 2%, whereas the binding affinity of Oct-1 decreased by 93 ± 6% (Fig. 4D). This is consistent with the results of most of the previous studies, i.e. the –175 mutation decreased GATA-1 binding slightly but reduced Oct-1 binding greatly, which was just the opposite of the effects of the –173 mutation. The HPFH Phenotype Was Also Reproduced in Transgenic Mice Carrying μ′LCRAγ–173ψβδβ—To further investigate whether –173 T to C substitution of the Aγ gene could reestablish the HPFH phenotype in vivo, we produced the construct μ′LCRAγ–173ψβδβ. Three transgenic lines carrying the construct were established, and developmental expression of the globin genes was analyzed (Fig. 5; Table III). The human γ/mouse α + ζ mRNA/copy ranged between 5% and 14% in adults, whereas the highest Aγ-globin mRNA expression in the fetal stage of the transgenic animals was between 17% and 25%. The Aγ-globin gene expression in the adult stage was between 25% and 65% of the maximal fetal-stage expression level. Despite expression variation between lines, the results showed that the Aγ-globin gene with the –173 mutation still remained active in the adult stage of mouse development. The –173 mutation resulted in the HPFH phenotype in transgenic mice, similar to the manifestation of the Aγ-globin gene bearing the –175 mutation (Fig. 6).Table IIIGlobin gene expression in transgenic mouse lines carrying μ′LCRAγ-173ψβδβLineDevelopmental ageCopy no.aCopy no., number of transgenes in haploid cell.Human γ mRNA/mouse α + ζ mRNA/copy %bThree to four F2 animals were analyzed in each.Adult γ mRNA/peak fetal γ mRNAmean ± S.D.%dcd, days post-coitus. 11.53 ± 1.5d 13.520 ± 0.5307d 16.5220 ± 4.325d 18.518 ± 0.5Newborn17 ± 2.5Adult5 ± 0.7d 11.513 ± 3.4d 13.518 ± 2.4d 16.525 ± 6.7315d 18.5121 ± 1256Newborn15 ± 4.7Adult14 ± 5.3d 11.53 ± 2.1d 13.514 ± 1.2d 16.517 ± 2.6318d 18.5216 ± 2.665Newborn13 ± 0.7Adult11 ± 4.4a Cop"

This action of Gem is mediated by regulated α1-subunit expression at the plasma membrane. In the present study, we examined the mechanism of the inhibition of VDCC activity by Gem. The β-interaction domain (BID) of the β-subunit, which specifically interacts with the α-interaction domain (AID) of the α1-subunit, is shown to be essential for the interaction between Gem and β-subunits. In addition, the AID peptide inhibited interaction between Gem and β-subunits in a dose-dependent manner. GemS88N mutant, which has low binding affinity for guanine nucleotide, did not interact with β-subunits, allowing α1-subunit expression at the plasma membrane. This inhibitory effect of wild-type Gem on VDCC activity was reduced in cells expressing GemS88N. The overexpression of wild-type Gem in pancreatic β-cell line MIN6 cells suppressed Ca2+-triggered secretion, whereas overexpression of GemS88N induced Ca2+-triggered secretion to control level.

The VDCCs are multisubunit proteins composed of α1, β, α2/δ, and γ-subunits. The α1-subunit includes the pore of the channel, the voltage sensor, and the binding sites of drugs and toxins that modulate channel activity. Although the biophysical diversity of native VDCCs is conferred by α1-subunits, auxiliary subunits β, α2/δ, and γ modulate channel properties including current amplitude, voltage dependence, and kinetics of activation and inactivation (8Singer D.

The I-II loop of the α1-subunit includes the endoplasmic reticulum retention signal and inhibits trafficking of α1-subunits to the plasma membrane. The interaction of the loop with the β-subunit masks the retention signal in the loop, leading to channel expression at the plasma membrane (23Bichet D. Cornet V. Geib S. Carlier E. Volsen S.

BID comprises the amino-terminal 30 amino acids of the second conserved domain of the β-subunit.Gem was identified originally in mitogen-induced peripheral blood T cells (25Maguire J. Santoro T. Jensen P. Siebenlist U. Yewdell J. Kelly K. Science. 1994; 265: 241-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar) and oncogenic tyrosine kinase-transformed cells (26Cohen L. Mohr R. Chen Y.Y.

Gem is a member of the RGK (Rem, Rad, and Gem/kir) family consisting of a long amino-terminal region, a Ras-related core domain, and a carboxyl-terminal region lacking a CAAX motif (27Finlin B.S.

We previously reported that Gem inhibits the trafficking of the α1-subunits of N, P/Q, and L-type VDCCs to the plasma membrane by interacting with the β-subunits (29Beguin P. Nagashima K. Gonoi T. Shibasaki T. Takahashi K. Kashima Y. Ozaki N. Geering K. Iwanaga T. Seino S. Nature. 2001; 411: 701-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar), inhibiting channel activities. Inhibition of cell surface expression also is involved in the interaction of the Gem carboxyl terminus with Ca2+/calmodulin. Recently, it has been shown that Rad and Rem, members of the RGK family, also inhibit VDCC activity by binding to the β-subunit (30Finlin B.S. Crump S.M. Satin J. Andres D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 14469-14474Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar).In the present study, we examined the mechanism of regulation of VDCC activity by Gem. We find that Gem inhibits VDCC activity through its interaction with BID and that the binding of guanine nucleotide to Gem is required for expression of α1-subunits at plasma membrane, VDCC activity, and Ca2+-triggered hormone secretion. Because the RGK proteins Rad, Rem, and Gem all share conserved structural features (25Maguire J. Santoro T. Jensen P. Siebenlist U. Yewdell J. Kelly K.

Science. 1993; 262: 1441-1444Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar), a common mechanism may exist in the regulation of VDCC activities by small G-proteins.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESConstructions—Rabbit α11.2-subunit, rat wild-type β3-subunit, and β3-subunit lacking BID (amino acid residues 163–203) (β3ΔBID) were subcloned in pCMV expression vector as FLAG-tagged protein (Sigma). AID was subcloned in pCMV expression vector as EGFP-tagged protein (Clontech Laboratories, Inc.). Rat wild-type β3-subunit was subcloned in pCMV expression vector. Mouse Gem was subcloned in pCMV expression vector as Myc-tagged protein. Site-directed mutagenesis of Gem was performed by the PCR-based method.Recombinant Proteins—Mouse Gem was expressed as glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion protein and purified by affinity chromatography with glutathione-resin (Amersham Biosciences Corp.). AID peptides (amino acid residues 458–475) in the I-II loop of rabbit α11.2-subunit were synthesized and purified using reverse-phase chromatography.Cell Culture and Transfection—COS-1 cells, MIN6 cells, and tsA201 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Sigma) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Sigma) and 1 mm MEM sodium pyruvate solution (Invitrogen) at 37 °C in 5% CO2. PC12 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 5% horse serum (Invitrogen) and 5% fetal bovine serum (Sigma) at 37 °C in 10% CO2. Transfections were performed using the Lipofectamine Reagent and Plus Reagent (Invitrogen).Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting—Transfected COS-1 cells were homogenized in hypotonic buffer (10 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.8, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 10 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The homogenate was centrifuged at 800 × g for 5 min. The supernatant was centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 20 min. The resulting pellet was extracted in extract buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm MgCl2, 100 mm NaCl, 0.5% Tween 20, 10 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The extracts were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-FLAG M2 antibody (Sigma). The bound proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, followed by immunoblotting with anti-Myc antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnologies Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) or anti-living colors A.v. peptide antibody (Clontech).Electrophysiology—The whole-cell VDCC currents in PC12 cells were recorded as described (29Beguin P. Nagashima K. Gonoi T. Shibasaki T. Takahashi K. Kashima Y. Ozaki N. Geering K. Iwanaga T. Seino S. Nature. 2001; 411: 701-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Briefly, Ba2+ was used as a charged carrier for measurement of VDCC currents. The extracellular solution contained 40 mm Ba(OH)2, 20 mm 4-aminopyridine, 110 mm tetraethylammonium hydroxide, 10 mm tetraethylammonium chloride, 140 mm methanesulfonate, and 10 mm MOPS, pH 7.4. The pipette solution contained 10 mm cesium chloride, 130 mm cesium aspartate, 10 mm EGTA, 10 mm MOPS, and 5 mm Mg-ATP, pH 7.2. Cells were maintained at a holding potential of –60 mV. For recording VDCC currents, square pulses of 400-ms duration at potentials between –40 and +60 mV in steps of 10 mV were applied every 4 s. Currents were normalized by dividing by the membrane capacitance for each cell (31Kawaki J. Nagashima K. Tanaka J. Miki T. Miyazaki M. Gonoi T. Mitsuhashi N. Nakajima N. Iwanaga T. Yano H. Seino S. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 2001-2006Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Recordings were performed using the Axopatch200B amplifier (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA).Measurement of Growth Hormone (GH) Secretion—MIN6 cells were cotransfected with pXGH5-human (h)GH (Nichols Institute, San Juan Capistrano, CA) and pSRα-wild-type Gem or pSRα-GemS88N. As a control, the cells were cotransfected with pXGH5 and pSRα-β-galactosidase. One day after transfection, MIN6 cells were harvested and split to a 12-well plate at a density of 5.0 × 105 cells/well. Two days after transfection, MIN6 cells were washed three times with KRB G1.0 (140 mm NaCl, 4.7 mm KCl, 1.2 mm KH2PO4, 1.2 mm MgSO4, 5.0 mm NaHCO3, 2.5 mm CaCl2, 10 mm HEPES, pH7.4, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, and 1.0 mm glucose) and then preincubated at 37 °C for 30 min. After washing with KRB G1.0, the cells were incubated at 37 °C for 10 min with a high K+ solution (KRB G1.0 containing 60 mm KCl and 85 mm NaCl) or a low K+ solution (KRB G1.0 containing 4.7 mm KCl and 140 mm NaCl). Amounts of hGH released into medium were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit (Roche Applied Science). Secretion was expressed as percent of the amount of hGH released into medium relative to the total cellular GH amounts (32Iezzi M. Regazzi R. Wollheim C.B. FEBS Lett. 2000; 474: 66-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar).Immunofluorescence Staining and Confocal Microscopy—The tsA201 cells were transfected with FLAG-tagged α11.2-subunit, β3-subunit, and wild-type Gem or GemS88N. The transfected cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, followed by permeabilization with 0.2% Triton X-100, and incubated with 10% normal goat serum in phosphate-buffered saline. The cells were incubated at room temperature for 60 min with anti-FLAG M2 antibody. As the secondary antibody, Cy3-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG antibody (Chemicon International, Temecula, CA) was used. The cells were mounted on cover slips using PermaFluor (Immunon Pittsburgh, CA) and observed using LSM510-Ver3.0 laser scanning microscope (Carl Zeiss Co., Ltd.).RESULTSBinding of Gem to β3-Subunit of VDCC through BID in β3-Subunit—It has been shown that the BID of β-subunits participates in modulation of VDCC activity through interaction with AID in α-subunits (24De Waard M. Witcher D.R. Pragnell M. Liu H. Campbell K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12056-12064Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). We investigated the involvement of BID in the interaction between Gem and the β3-subunit. FLAG-tagged wild-type β3-subunit, FLAG-tagged β3-subunit mutant lacking BID (β3ΔBID), EGFP-tagged AID, and Myc-tagged Gem (Fig. 1A) were expressed in COS-1 cells. FLAG-tagged β3ΔBID did not bind to EGFP-tagged AID, as reported previously (Fig. 1B) (24De Waard M. Witcher D.R. Pragnell M. Liu H. Campbell K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12056-12064Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). In addition, FLAG-tagged β3ΔBID did not bind to Myc-tagged Gem (Fig. 1C), suggesting that Gem specifically binds to BID in the β3-subunit.Because both AID and Gem bind to BID in the β3-subunit, we investigated AID inhibition of the binding of Gem and BID. As shown in Fig. 1D, the binding of GST-tagged Gem and FLAG-tagged β3-subunit was inhibited in an AID peptide dose (0–1 μg)-dependent manner, suggesting that the inhibitory effect of Gem on the trafficking of α1-subunits to the plasma membrane is because of its blocking of the interaction between BID and AID.Requirement of Guanine Nucleotide Binding of Gem for Interaction between Gem and β3-Subunit—Activation of small G-proteins leads to stimulation of the downstream pathway through effector proteins. Because the RasS17N mutant, which has low binding affinity for the guanine nucleotide, cannot bind to Ras effector proteins and functions in a dominant negative manner, the mutant has been used to investigate the effect of GTP-bound form (active form) of Ras on its physiological functions (33Feig L.A. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 25-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). By analogy to RasS17N mutant, we constructed Gem mutant in which Ser at 88 was substituted by Asn (GemS88N), as described previously (34Piddini E. Schmid J.A. de Martin R. Dotti C.G. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4076-4087Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 35Leone A. Mitsiades N. Ward Y. Spinelli B. Poulaki V. Tsokos M. Kelly K. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 3217-3225Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The mutant has been shown to have reduced guanine nucleotide-binding affinity (35Leone A. Mitsiades N. Ward Y. Spinelli B. Poulaki V. Tsokos M. Kelly K. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 3217-3225Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). We investigated to find out whether the guanine nucleotide-binding of Gem is required for binding Gem and the β3-subunit using GemS88N. GST-tagged GemS88N and FLAG-tagged β3-subunit expressed in COS-1 cells was subjected to an in vitro binding assay. The binding of GST-tagged GemS88N to the FLAG-tagged β3-subunit was significantly decreased compared with that of wild-type Gem to FLAG-tagged β3-subunit (Fig. 2A). In COS-1 cells coexpressing Myc-tagged GemS88N and FLAG-tagged β3-subunit, Myc-tagged GemS88N did not bind to FLAG-tagged β3-subunit (Fig. 2B). These results suggest that guanine nucleotide-binding of Gem is required for the interaction between Gem and the β3-subunit.Fig. 2Binding of wild-type Gem or GemS88N to β3-subunit.A, in vitro binding of wild-type Gem (WT Gem) or GemS88N mutant to β3-subunit.

B, in vivo binding of GemS88N to β3-subunit in COS-1 cells. FLAG-tagged β3-subunit and Myc-tagged wild-type Gem (WT Gem) or GemS88N were expressed in COS-1 cells.

Subcellular localization of the FLAG-tagged α11.2-subunit in tsA201 cells expressing GemS88N, FLAG-tagged α11.2-subunit, and β3-subunit were analyzed by confocal microscopy. In cells expressing FLAG-tagged α11.2-subunit alone, the α11.2-subunit was not localized to the plasma membrane (Fig. 3A). In cells expressing the FLAG-tagged α11.2-subunit and β3-subunit, the α11.2-subunit was localized to plasma membrane (Fig. 3B). When wild-type Gem was expressed together with the FLAG-tagged α11.2-subunit and β3-subunit, the α11.2-subunit was not localized to plasma membrane (Fig. 3C), as described previously (29Beguin P. Nagashima K. Gonoi T. Shibasaki T. Takahashi K. Kashima Y. Ozaki N. Geering K. Iwanaga T. Seino S. Nature. 2001; 411: 701-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). However, when GemS88N was expressed together with the FLAG-tagged α11.2-subunit and β3-subunit, the α11.2-subunit was mainly localized to plasma membrane (Fig. 3D). No effects of GemS88N on the subcellular localization of the α11.2-subunit were found in any of the transfected tsA201 cells.Fig. 3Subcellular localization of α1 1.2-subunit in tsA201 cells. The tsA201 cells were transfected with FLAG-tagged α1 1.2-subunit, β3-subunit, and wild-type Gem or GemS88N. Immunostaining of the cells fixed with paraformaldehyde was performed with anti-FLAG M2 antibody followed by Cy3-conjugated anti-mouse IgG antibody. FLAG-tagged α11.2-subunit alone is expressed in A. FLAG-tagged α1 unit and 1.2-sub-β3-subunit are expressed in B. FLAG-tagged α1 1.2-subunit, β3-subunit, and wild-type Gem are expressed in C.

Logothetis D.E. Hess P. Neuron. 1989; 2: 1453-1463Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar). In PC12 cells expressing wild-type Gem or GemS88N, the I-V relationship of VDCC was measured (Fig. 4). The overexpression of wild-type Gem in PC12 cells resulted in a significant inhibition of endogenous Ca2+ channel currents, whereas overexpression of the GemS88N had only a small inhibitory effect (Fig. 4).Fig. 4Effect of GemS88N on I-V relationship of Ca2+ channel currents in PC12 cells.I-V relationship of Ca2+ channels in PC12 cells transfected with EGFP (control) (filled circle), wild-type Gem (open square), or GemS88N (filled square).

We examined the effect of GemS88N on Ca2+-triggered exocytosis in MIN6 cells. For this purpose, we utilized MIN6 cells transfected with hGH (32Iezzi M. Regazzi R. Wollheim C.B. FEBS Lett. 2000; 474: 66-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) and monitored secretion by measuring the hGH release from MIN6 cells transfected with GemS88N under high K+ stimulation. The overexpression of wild-type Gem in MIN6 cells inhibited hGH secretion from 10.6 ± 0.6% of total (control, MIN6 cells overexpressing β-galactosidase) to 7.9 ± 0.8% of total. In contrast, in MIN6 cells overexpressing GemS88N, the hGH secretion (11.5 ± 0.9% of total) was comparable with the control level (Fig. 5). These results suggest that inhibitory effects of Gem on both VDCC activity and hormone secretion are involved in its guanine nucleotide-binding.Fig. 5Effect of wild-type Gem or GemS88N on Ca2+-triggered hGH secretion in MIN6 cells. MIN6 cells expressing hGH together with β-galactosidase (Control), wild-type Gem (WT Gem), or GemS88N were incubated in buffer (1 mm glucose + 4.7 mm K+). After 30 min, the cells were stimulated with high K+ buffer (1 mm glucose + 60 mm K+). GH secretion by high K+ stimulation in MIN6 cells was measured.

FEBS Lett. 1994; 352: 141-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). We previously reported that interaction of β-subunits with Gem prevents the trafficking of α1-subunits to the plasma membrane in the regulation of VDCC activity (29Beguin P. Nagashima K. Gonoi T. Shibasaki T. Takahashi K. Kashima Y. Ozaki N. Geering K. Iwanaga T. Seino S. Nature. 2001; 411: 701-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). It also has been found that infection of guinea pig heart with adenovirus carrying Gem markedly decreased L-type VDCC density at the sarcolemma of isolated ventricular myocytes (37Murata M. Cingolani E. McDonald A.D. Donahue J.K. Marban E. Circ. Res. 2004; 95: 398-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). However, the mechanism of the inhibition of VDCC activity by Gem was not known. BID in β-subunits has been shown to interact with AID in the I-II loop of α-subunits in the modulation of VDCC activity (24De Waard M. Witcher D.R. Pragnell M. Liu H. Campbell K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12056-12064Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). We found that BID also is required for interaction with Gem and that the AID peptide inhibits the binding of Gem to the β-subunits. These findings suggest a competitive interaction between Gem and the α1-subunits at the BID site. In addition to BID, the β3-subunit contains Src homology 3 (SH3) and guanylate kinase domains (38Hanlon M.R. Berrow N.S. Dolphin A.C. Wallace B.A. FEBS Lett. 1999; 445: 366-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The tandem arrangement of these domains is characterized in membrane-associated guanylate kinase, which serves as the scaffold proteins that organize the signaling pathway (39Anderson J.M. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 382-384Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). These motifs are required in the modulation of VDCC activity (40Takahashi S.X. Miriyala J. Colecraft H.M.

The molecular determinants of this effect were analyzed using insulinoma cell lines and cells transfected with either wild type or mutated KATP subunits. Zinc activated KATP in cells co-expressing rat Kir6.2 and SUR1 subunits, as in insulinoma cell lines. In contrast, zinc exerted an inhibitory action on SUR2A-containing cells. Therefore, SUR1 expression is required for the activating action of zinc, which also depended on extracellular pH and was blocked by diethyl pyrocarbonate, suggesting histidine involvement. The five SUR1-specific extracellular histidine residues were submitted to site-directed mutagenesis. Of them, two histidines (His-326 and His-332) were found to be critical for the activation of KATP by zinc, as confirmed by the double mutation H326A/H332A. In conclusion, zinc activates KATP by binding itself to extracellular His-326 and His-332 of the SUR1 subunit. Thereby zinc could exert a negative control on cell excitability and secretion process of pancreatic β-and α-cells. In fact, we have recently shown that such a mechanism occurs in hippocampal mossy fibers, a brain region characterized, like the pancreas, by an important accumulation of zinc and a high density of SUR1-containing KATP.

Thereby zinc could exert a negative control on cell excitability and secretion process of pancreatic β-and α-cells. In fact, we have recently shown that such a mechanism occurs in hippocampal mossy fibers, a brain region characterized, like the pancreas, by an important accumulation of zinc and a high density of SUR1-containing KATP.

As for the SUR subunit, two closely related genes, SUR1 and SUR2, have been cloned with different splice variants such as SUR2A and SUR2B (6Inagaki N. Gonoi T. Clement J.P. Wang C.Z. Aguilar-Bryan L.

(Lond.). 1999; 521: 337-350Crossref Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Depending on tissues or organs, the different molecular forms of SUR and Kir6.x proteins co-assemble to form KATP channels with different functional and pharmacological properties (13Aguilar-Bryan L. Bryan J. Endocr. Rev. 1999; 20: 101-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar, 14Seino S. Miki T. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 2003; 81: 133-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar). Cardiac and skeletal muscle KATP channels are comprised of Kir6.2 and SUR2A, whereas vascular smooth muscle KATP channels combine the subunit SUR2B with either Kir6.1 or Kir6.2. The pancreatic β-cell KATP channels involved in insulin secretion are comprised of Kir6.2 and SUR1. This pattern is also abundant in the mammalian central nervous system, especially in the hippocampal mossy fiber nerve terminals (15Karschin C. Ecke C. Ashcroft F.M. Karschin A. FEBS Lett. 1997; 401: 59-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). In addition, several other subunit combinations have been described in the central nervous system (14Seino S. Miki T. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 2003; 81: 133-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar). Strikingly, several structures possessing KATP channels of the Kir6.2 and SUR1 type, such as pancreatic β-cells and hippocampal mossy fibers, also contain substantial amounts of zinc (16Frederickson C.J. Int. Rev. Neurobiol. 1989; 31: 145-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (959) Google Scholar, 17Kristiansen L.H. Rungby J. Sondergaard L.G. Stoltenberg M. Danscher G. Histochem.

Brain Res. 1989; 486: 159-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Puzzled by this co-localization, we found that micromolar concentrations of zinc hyperpolarize β-cells from an insulin-secreting pancreatic line (RINm5F) by activating KATP channels (19Bloc A. Cens T. Cruz H. Dunant Y. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2000; 529: 723-734Crossref Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Moreover, this mechanism was also found using mossy fiber synaptosomes of the rat hippocampus (20Bancila V. Nikonenko I. Dunant Y. Bloc A. J. Neurochem. 2004; 90: 1243-1250Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). In both cases KATP activation by zinc resulted in a decreased secretion of insulin from β-cells and of glutamate from mossy fiber terminals. This effect might be physiologically relevant, because it suggests that the transition metal could be involved in a paracrine or autocrine negative feedback regulation of release. However, in contrast to our results, Kwok and Kass (21Kwok W.M. Kass R.S. J. Gen. Physiol. 1993; 102: 693-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) observed a block of cardiac KATP channels by low concentrations of extracellular divalent cations, including zinc. This discrepancy led us to hypothesis that zinc could induce opposite effects on different types of KATP, depending on the subunit composition of the channel. The cloning of cDNAs encoding KATP channel subunits afforded us the opportunity to determine the molecular basis of zinc-induced activation of recombinant KATP channels. Thus, the present study aimed to investigate the mechanisms by which zinc activates or inhibits KATP channels and more particularly whether definite molecular compositions of SUR and Kir subunits are critical for these effects. Preliminary results (22Prost A.L. Bloc A. Hussy N. Derand R. Vivaudou M. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2004; 559: 157-167Crossref Scopus (60) Google Scholar) suggested that the SUR1 subunit was involved in KATP activation by extracellular zinc. So far, however, systematic subunit-combination analysis and clear-cut identification of domain and/or amino acid residues involved in zinc binding to KATP have not been performed. To achieve this, we used electrophysiological techniques to investigate the effects of zinc on recombinant KATP reconstituted in human embryonic kidney (HEK293T) cells by transient transfection of various combinations of rat SURx and Kir6.x subunits. By using pH modifications, pharmacological tools, and site-directed mutagenesis, we identified two histidine residues present in the extracellular side of SUR1 as mandatory for activation of KATP channels by zinc. Cell Culture—HEK293T cells and insulin-producing cell lines (RINm5F and INS-1E) were obtained from the Laboratoire de Biochimie Clinique, CMU, Geneva. Cells were cultured at 37 °C and in a humidified 5% CO2, 95% air atmosphere in RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 11 mm glucose, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. 1–5 days before experiments were carried out, RINm5F, INS-1E, and transfected HEK293T cells were seeded out onto Falcon 3001-type Petri dishes (BD Biosciences) at 100–200,000 cells/dish in RPMI 1640 medium. Cloning—Rat Kir6.1 and Kir6.2 cDNAs (GenBank D42145.1 and X97041.1, respectively) were cloned from rat lung and the rat insulinoma cell line RINm5F, respectively, using a RT-PCR-based strategy with 5′- and 3′-untranslated region-specific primers based upon the published sequence (7Inagaki N. Gonoi T. Clement J.P. Namba N. Inazawa J. Gonzalez G. Aguilar-Bryan L. Seino S. Bryan J. Science. 1995; 270: 1166-1170Crossref PubMed Scopus (1610) Google Scholar, 8Inagaki N. Tsuura Y. Namba N.

The resulting PCR products (1290 and 1180 bp for Kir6.1 and Kir6.2, respectively) were subcloned into pRCII (Invitrogen), and the sequences were confirmed on six independently isolated clones. cDNA encoding the rat sulfonylurea receptor SUR1 (GenBank X97279.1) was isolated by RT-PCR from RINm5F cells. Three overlapping PCR products were generated using specific oligonucleotides primer pairs based upon the known sequence (10Aguilar-Bryan L. Nichols C.G. Wechsler S.W. Clement J.P. Boyd A.E. Gonzalez G. Herrera-Sosa H. Nguy K. Bryan J. Nelson D.A. Science. 1995; 268: 423-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (1281) Google Scholar). The amplified products were subcloned into pBluescript II KS+ (Invitrogen). The sequences were confirmed on several independently isolated clones before the reconstitution of the full-length cDNA. Site-directed Mutagenesis—The sequences of the SUR1 and SUR2A subunits of KATP were obtained from GenBank (accession numbers X97279.1 and D83598.1, respectively). In vitro site-directed mutagenesis of selected histidine residues on the rat SUR1 gene were performed each separately on the pcDNA3/SUR1 vector using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit from Stratagene. Each mutation introduced a single amino acid, changing a histidine to an alanine residue in the corresponding coding region of the cDNA. The double mutation H326A/H332A was done on the single cDNA mutant histidine 332 by using mutagenic primers (F/326 and R/326) introducing the H326A mutation. Mutagenesis and amplification reactions were performed with a PCR Mastercycler (Eppendorf) in a 50-μl reaction volume, containing 1.5 mm MgCl2, with 50 ng of DNA pcDNA3/SUR1, 125 ng of each primer, 1 ml of mix dNTPs 10 mm, 3 plaque-forming units and plaque-forming unit buffer. Incorporation and extension of the mutagenic primers were done with the following cycling program, 1 run at 95 °C during 30 s and 25 runs of 30 s at 95 °C, 1 min at 55 °C, and 20 min at 68 °C. The non-mutated parental DNA template was digested with DpnI during 1 h at 37 °C, and 5 μl of the PCR mix was used to transform DH5α-competent bacteria by heat shock at 37 °C. The sequence of each mutated cDNA was confirmed by full sequencing. Transfections—The coding regions of wild type rat Kir6.1, Kir6.2, SUR1, SUR2A, or mutated SUR1 cDNAs were subcloned into the expression vector pcDNA3 (Invitrogen). The combinations of these plasmids were transfected into HEK293T cells grown to 70% confluence in Falcon 3004-type Petri dishes. Transfections were performed overnight by CaCl2 precipitation with 4 μg/well of Kir6.x + SURx combinations (ratio 1:3), together with 0.5 μg of vector pEGFP (Invitrogen) in fresh Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 10% fetal calf serum medium. Twelve hours after transfection cells were seeded out onto Falcon 3001-type Petri dishes and cultured in RPMI 1640 medium. The cells expressing green fluorescent protein were identified by fluorescence microscopy and used for electrophysiological recordings. Electrophysiology—Whole-cell recordings were performed using fire-polished electrodes pulled from borosilicate glass and showing an open resistance of 2–3 megohms. Signals were amplified using an Axopatch 200-B amplifier and filtered through a 4-pole low pass Bessel filter at 1 or 2 kHz, before digitization with a Digidata 1200 interface and analysis with pClamp 8 software (Axon Instruments, Inc., Foster City, CA). Capacitative transients and series resistance were compensated (≥70%), using the circuitry incorporated within the amplifier. The external solution contained 145 mm NaCl, 3 mm KCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 2 mm MgCl2, 10 mm Hepes, and 10 mm d-glucose. The pH was adjusted (with NaOH) to 7.2 in standard conditions and from 5.6 to 8.0 for pH dependence studies. The patch pipette solution contained 10 mm NaCl, 140 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm Hepes, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm MgATP, pH 7.2 (KOH). All experiments were performed at room temperature (20–22 °C), and the equilibrium potential for K+ ions (EK+), calculated after correction of the liquid junction potential, was about –82 mV. Data Expression—In histograms, data are expressed as mean ± S.E. of zinc-induced changes in the holding current normalized to the control current, the control current being the level of holding current measured before zinc applications. Current values were determined by subtraction of tolbutamide- or glibenclamide-insensitive currents. n indicates the number of individual cells recorded for each conditions. Chemicals—Diethylpyrocarbonate (DEPC) was obtained from Brunschwing, (Basel, Switzerland), glibenclamide was from RBI (Fluka Chemie AG, Buchs, Switzerland), and zinc chloride and other inorganic salts (with negligible listed zinc contamination) were from Sigma. All solutions were prepared in distilled-deionized water to minimize basal zinc levels. Zinc Activates Native and Recombinant Kir6.2/SUR1 KATP Channels—Fig. 1 (A and B) shows that extracellular zinc at micromolar concentrations activates KATP current in two insulinoma cell lines (RINm5F and INS-1E), confirming our previous observation (19Bloc A. Cens T. Cruz H. Dunant Y. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2000; 529: 723-734Crossref Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The current enhanced by zinc reversed itself at approximately –80 mV and was fully blocked by tolbutamide. The rat Kir6.2/SUR1 KATP was reconstituted in HEK293T cells, a human embryonic kidney cell line, which does not express endogenous KATP channels (23Yu S.P. Kerchner G.A. J. Neurosci. Res. 1998; 52: 612-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Like native insulinoma cell lines, Kir6.2/SUR1-transfected HEK293T cells displayed an outward current that reversed itself at about –80 mV. This current was activated by zinc (10 μm) and suppressed by tolbutamide (Fig. 1C). HEK293T cells transfected with the vector pEGFP alone or with only one KATP subunit, either Kir6.2 or SUR1, did not display KATP or any endogenous current sensitive to zinc (Fig. 1D). The Effect of Zinc on Currents Carried by KATP Channels of Different Subunit Compositions—The effect of zinc was investigated on several clones transfected with different combinations of KATP channel subunits. Cells were held at –40 mV, and the effects of drugs were recorded as a function of time. The pattern shown by the Kir6.2/SUR1 clone was very similar to that of RINm5F cells. Zinc reversibly enhanced a pre-existing current that was also enhanced by diazoxide and completely abolished by tolbutamide. Actually, the effect of zinc was 2-fold: zinc induced first a rapid activation (“on effect”), which was followed by a slower inhibiting effect (“off effect”). The latter could easily be seen upon zinc washout (Fig. 2, A and B). In the present work we focused our investigation on the activating on effect. In cells transfected with Kir6.1/SUR1 subunits, zinc exerted a stronger activation than in Kir6.2/SUR1 clones (Fig. 2C). In contrast, cells transfected with either the Kir6.2/SUR2A or the Kir6.1/SUR2A combination presented a glibenclamide-sensitive current, which was not activated but inhibited by zinc application (Fig. 2, D and E). The inhibitory effect of zinc was particularly visible when pinacidil was used to previously open this type of KATP channel. A more quantitative evaluation is summarized in Fig. 2F, where the effect of zinc is expressed as a function of the pre-existing KATP current amplitude. RINm5F cells and the Kir6.1/SUR1 and Kir6.2/SUR1 clones characteristically displayed an activating effect. In contrast, Kir6.1/SUR2A and Kir6.2/SUR2A clones exhibited an inhibitory effect. Therefore, activation of KATP current by zinc requires SUR1 subunit expression. Also in the presence of Kir6.1, combined with either SUR1 or SUR2A subunits, the amplitude of zinc-induced effects was enhanced. pH Dependence of Zinc-induced KATP Activation—It has been shown that zinc ions can interact with proteins by direct binding to either histidine, cysteine, aspartate, or glutamate residues (24Berg J.M. Shi Y. Science. 1996; 271: 1081-1085Crossref PubMed Scopus (1665) Google Scholar, 25Higaki J.N. Fletterick R.J. Craik C.S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 100-104Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 26Regan L. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1993; 22: 257-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). The binding of zinc to these amino acids is expected to be differently affected by changes in H+ ion concentration. In the case of KATP, this should modify the zinc-induced activation of the channel. To test this, the action of zinc on the KATP current was examined as a function of extracellular pH on RIN-5F cells. As shown in Fig. 3A, zinc provoked a more pronounced activation of the KATP current at pH 8.0 than at pH 6.8. At pH 5.6, zinc was clearly inhibitory. By titrating the effect of zinc as a function of pH over the range of 5.6 and 8.0, we found a reverse point, which was close to pH 6.4 (Fig. 3B). This profile of pH dependence suggested a histidine side chain (pKa ∼ 6–7) rather than a cysteine (pKa ∼ 8–9) as the relevant target at the zinc binding site (27Kurz L.L. Klink H. Jakob I. Kuchenbecker M. Benz S. Lehmann-Horn F. Rudel R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11687-11692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The Histidine-modifying Reagent Diethylpyrocarbonate Blocks Zinc Effect—DEPC, a substance which reacts with neutral imidazole groups, provided an additional test to confirm the involvement of histidine residues. We pre-treated Kir6.2/SUR1 transfected HEK293T cells with 1 mm DEPC for 1–2 min. As a result, the activating action of zinc on KATP current was abolished, but the basic KATP current was not affected. The blockade by DEPC could be partially reversed by giving hydroxylamine (0.1 m) for a few minutes (Fig. 4). To examine nevertheless a possible role of cysteine residues, we used the sulfhydryl-modifying reagent methanethiosulfonate ethyltrimethylammonium, a compound that is poorly permeable through membranes (28Horenstein J. Akabas M.H. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 53: 870-877PubMed Google Scholar) and thus will act only on extracellular sites under our conditions. At the concentration of 1 mm for 1–2 min, methanethiosulfonate ethyltrimethylammonium application did not modify the effects of zinc on Kir6.2/SUR1-transfected HEK293T cells (not illustrated). These observations strengthened the hypothesis that histidine residues on the SUR1 subunit were crucial for the activation of KATP channels by zinc, most probably without implication of extracellular cysteines. Binding Site for Zinc Ions on the KATP Channel SUR1 Subunit, Site-directed Mutagenesis—Comparison of the extracellular segments of SUR subunits of the rat KATP channel revealed that five histidine residues are present in SUR1 but not in SUR2A. These are His-11 and His-160, located in the first transmembrane domain (TMD-0), His-326 and His-332 in TMD-1, and His-1273 in TMD-2. SUR1-specific extracellular histidines were individually mutated and replaced by the neutral amino acid, alanine. Fig. 5 illustrates the site of the different mutations (Fig. 5A) and the corresponding KATP currents recorded in the response to voltage ramps before, during, and after zinc application (Fig. 5B). Averaged zinc-induced changes in wild type and mutated channels are expressed in Fig. 5C as a percentage of the control KATP current measured before zinc application. Mutations H11A, H160A, and H1273A had no effect, as zinc enhanced the KATP current in these clones to the same extent as in the wild type Kir6.2/SUR1 channels. In contrast, both mutations H326A and H332A, and even more so the double mutation H326A/H332A, converted the activation into inhibition. Thus, the site of zinc activation of the rat KATP channel requires the His-326 and His-332 residues of SUR1, which are situated on the first extracellular loop of the second transmembrane domain (TMD-1). SUR1 Is the Target of KATP Activation by Zinc—Our results should contribute to solving a discrepancy concerning the opposite effects of extracellular zinc ions on the KATP channels of β-pancreatic and neuronal types versus the cardiac type. On the one hand, Kwok and Kass (21Kwok W.M. Kass R.S. J. Gen. Physiol. 1993; 102: 693-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) reported that micromolar zinc concentrations inhibited the opening of cardiac KATP channels, on the other hand, our data indicated that the same treatment activated KATP channels in murine pancreatic β-cells (19Bloc A. Cens T. Cruz H. Dunant Y. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2000; 529: 723-734Crossref Scopus (56) Google Scholar) and hippocampal mossy fiber nerve terminals (20Bancila V. Nikonenko I. Dunant Y. Bloc A. J. Neurochem. 2004; 90: 1243-1250Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). We showed here that zinc effects are actually 2-fold. Inhibition occurs with all types of channels but activation is prevalent in SUR1-containing KATP. Therefore, the SUR1 subunit is absolutely required for the activating action. Channels containing the SUR1 subunit are particularly expressed in pancreatic β-cells as well as hippocampus granular cells and their mossy fiber terminals (15Karschin C. Ecke C. Ashcroft F.M. Karschin A. FEBS Lett. 1997; 401: 59-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar), whereas SUR2A and SUR2B subunits are present in the KATP channels of cardiac and skeletal muscles as well as of vascular and other smooth muscles (13Aguilar-Bryan L. Bryan J. Endocr. Rev. 1999; 20: 101-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar, 14Seino S. Miki T. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 2003; 81: 133-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar). This provides an explanation for the opposite effects of zinc on KATP channels present in different structures. It is interesting, in this connection, to recall also that pancreatic β-cells and mossy fiber terminals of hippocampus are not only rich in SUR1-containing channels but contain the highest zinc concentration of the organism (16Frederickson C.J. Int. Rev. Neurobiol. 1989; 31: 145-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (959) Google Scholar, 17Kristiansen L.H. Rungby J. Sondergaard L.G. Stoltenberg M. Danscher G. Histochem. Cell Biol. 2001; 115: 125-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Identification of Zinc Binding Sites on Ion Channels—Zinc can interact with various ligand-gated and voltage-gated ion channels generally causing inhibition. Interestingly, the action of zinc on glycine receptors has been reported to be biphasic (potentiation and inhibition) corresponding to separate binding sites (29Harvey R.J. Thomas P. James C.H. Wilderspin A. Smart T.G. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1999; 520: 53-64Crossref Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Our present study suggests the same for KATP channels where activation or inhibition by zinc may occur at different sites of the Kir and SUR subunits. Histidine residues have been identified as essential for the zinc inhibition of several subtypes of γ-aminobutyric acid receptors, depending on critical localization of histidines on definite subunits (28Horenstein J. Akabas M.H. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 53: 870-877PubMed Google Scholar, 30Fisher J.L. Macdonald R.L. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 2944-2953Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 31Wang T.L. Hackam A. Guggino W.B. Cutting G.R. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 7684-7691Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 32Wooltorton J.R. McDonald B.J. Moss S.J. Smart T.G. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1997; 505: 633-640Crossref Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Also, in recombinant N-methyl-d-aspartate receptors critical histidines (His-42, His-44, and His-128) are required for high affinity, voltage-independent, pH-dependent zinc inhibition (33Choi Y.B. Lipton S.A. Neuron. 1999; 23: 171-180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 34Low C.M. Zheng F. Lyuboslavsky P. Traynelis S.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 11062-11067Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Activation of acid-sensing ion channels by zinc implicates two critical histidines (His-162 and His-339) as well (35Baron A. Schaefer L. Lingueglia E. Champigny G. Lazdunski M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35361-35367Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). In addition to histidine residues, cysteines have also been shown to participate in zinc binding to ion channels. As an example Cys-546 is critical for the zinc blockage of human skeletal muscle chloride channels (27Kurz L.L. Klink H. Jakob I. Kuchenbecker M. Benz S. Lehmann-Horn F. Rudel R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11687-11692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The case of AMPAR is particularly interesting in connection with the present work, because it generates currents that are potentiated by micromolar concentrations of zinc (36Dreixler J.C. Leonard J.P. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 1994; 22: 144-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Histidine 412 seems to be critical for zinc binding on the AMPAR, because it is present on GluR2–4 (sensitive to zinc) but not on GluR1 (non-sensitive) subunits (37Armstrong N. Gouaux E. Neuron. 2000; 28: 165-181Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (792) Google Scholar). We also identified two histidines (His-326 and His-332) as critical amino acid residues for the activation action of zinc on the extracellular side of KATP SUR1 subunit. The site is localized on the short extracellular loop between the first and second segment of TMD1. The zinc binding site seems to be fully independent from the sulfonylurea binding site, which is localized in the intracellular side of SUR on TMD-2 (38Ashfield R. Gribble F.M. Ashcroft S.J.

Indeed, tolbutamide equally blocked KATP current in all mutated clones (Fig. 5), and the activation by zinc was additive to the activation induced by diazoxide (Fig. 2). Physiological Significance of KATP Channel Activation by Zinc—By linking the cell metabolism with the membrane potential, and thereby electrical activity, KATP channels regulate important physiological functions in various tissues. In the pancreatic β-cells, the KATP channels are critically involved in the control of glucose-induced insulin secretion. An increase in glucose metabolism in the vicinity of KATP channels depolarizes the membrane of the β-cells, leading to the opening of voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels and thereby to an increase in insulin secretion (40Seino S. Iwanaga T. Nagashima K. Miki T. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 311-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Zinc is co-stored with insulin in pancreatic granules and co-released by exocytosis (17Kristiansen L.H. Rungby J. Sondergaard L.G. Stoltenberg M. Danscher G. Histochem. Cell Biol. 2001; 115: 125-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). We found that micromolar concentrations of zinc hyperpolarized the β-cells by activating KATP channels, reducing cell excitability and calcium spike firing (19Bloc A. Cens T. Cruz H. Dunant Y. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2000; 529: 723-734Crossref Scopus (56) Google Scholar). As a consequence, further release of insulin is reduced. 2V. Bancila, P. Maeschler, Y. Dunant, and A. Bloc, manuscript in preparation. In this way, zinc could ensure a negative feedback on insulin and on its own secretion. However, a more relevant physiological role for the activation of pancreatic KATP channels by β-cell-secreted zinc can be to regulate glucagon release from α-cells. Indeed, α-cells are also provided with SUR1-containing KATP channels (41Bokvist K. Olsen H.L. Hoy M. Gotfredsen C.F. Holmes W.F. Buschard K. Rorsman P. Gromada J. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1999; 438: 428-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), and because intra-islet circulation is expected to carry zinc from β-cells toward α-cells, the release of glucagon will be reduced when insulin and zinc co-release is intense. This hypothesis is supported by the work of Ishihara et al. (42Ishihara H. Maechler P. Gjinovci A. Herrera P.L. Wollheim C.B. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 330-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar) who demonstrated that zinc secreted by β-cells is implicated in the suppression of glucagon secretion observed in response to β-cell activation. In this view, zinc would amplify the overall effect of insulin by decreasing that of glucagon. Thereby, the same stimulus may control reversibly regulated secretion from the two main pancreatic cellular populations. Similarly, in mossy fiber/CA3 neuron synapses of the hippocampus, zinc is concentrated in synaptic vesicles of nerve terminals. On stimulation, it is released (43Assaf S.Y. Chung S.H. Nature. 1984; 308: 734-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (1020) Google Scholar, 44Howell G.A. Welch M.G. Frederickson C.J. Nature. 1984; 308: 736-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (700) Google Scholar, 45Li Y. Hough C.J. Suh S.W. Sarvey J.M. Frederickson C.J. J. Neurophysiol. 2001; 86: 2597-2604Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar), and recent experiments have shown that zinc at low concentrations activates presynaptic KATP channels, reducing further glutamate release (20Bancila V. Nikonenko I. Dunant Y. Bloc A. J. Neurochem. 2004; 90: 1243-1250Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). At this level, zinc could play a role of negative feedback on transmission. Pathological Implications—Such data may be relevant to the pathological states of the pancreas, in view of the importance of β-cell dysfunction in the pathogenesis of type-2 diabetes, or hyperinsulinism. Some studies (46Lang D.A. Matthews D.R. Burnett M. Turner R.C. Diabetes. 1981; 30: 435-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar, 47Matthews D.R. Lang D.A. Burnett M.A. Turner R.C.

Metabolism. 2000; 49: 896-905Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), have reported disorganized oscillations of insulinemia in patients with type-2 diabetes and their near relatives with mild glucose intolerance. Insulin resistance of obese patients is also accompanied by a decrease in the regularity of pulsatile insulin secretion (52Zarkovic M. Ciric J. Stojanovic M. Penezic Z. Trbojevic B. Dresgic M. Nesovic M. Eur. J. Endocrinol. 1999; 141: 494-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Because oscillations of insulinemia favor optimal glucose homeostasis, one may speculate that a disturbance of this process in type-2 diabetes contributes to the disease. It would be most interesting to investigate whether the regulation of KATP channels and/or the feedback action of zinc might be perturbed in these affections. Zinc and KATP channels might also be involved in pathological conditions affecting the central nervous system. We recently found that micromolar amounts of zinc protect the nerve terminal from excessive depolarization, preventing massive transmitter release and neuronal death consecutive to anoxic insult. This neuroprotective effect was antagonized by tolbutamide, indicating KATP implication (20Bancila V. Nikonenko I. Dunant Y. Bloc A. J. Neurochem. 2004; 90: 1243-1250Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Moreover, overexpression of SUR1 or Kir6.2 subunits in mice has been reported to render animals more resistant to ischemic insults (53Hernandez-Sanchez C. Basile A.S. Fedorova I. Arima H. Stannard B.

Stannard B. Hernandez-Sanchez C. Mobbs C. Virsolvy A. LeRoith D. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2004; 25: 585-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Also, Kir6.2 knock-out mice are more sensitive to hypoxia-induced seizures (55Yamada K. Ji J.J. Yuan H. Miki T. Sato S. Horimoto N. Shimizu T. Seino S. Inagaki N. Science. 2001; 292: 1543-1546Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). In addition, zinc chelation or zinc deficiency is associated with an increased seizure susceptibility (56Mitchell C.L. Barnes M.I. Neurotoxicol. Teratol. 1993; 15: 165-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 57Noebels J.L. Sidman R.L. J. Neurogenet. 1989; 6: 53-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Mice knocked-out for the vesicular zinc transporter ZnT3 are more vulnerable to chemically induced seizures and consequent neuronal damage (58Cole T.B. Robbins C.A. Wenzel H.J. Schwartzkroin P.A. Palmiter R.D. Epilepsy Res. 2000; 39: 153-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). These observations could be explained by the mechanism described herein, i.e. a failure of KATP activation when synaptic zinc is low or absent. Conclusions—In pancreatic β-cells and hippocampal mossy fibers, zinc is concentrated in large amounts and released on activity. These cells are also characterized by a high density of KATP channels composed of the SUR1/Kir6.2 subunits. Because the extracellular concentration of zinc following release probably reaches the range (∼1 μm) needed for activation of KATP of this type, zinc can act as a negative feedback regulator of secretion of both insulin and glutamate. This effect is mediated by two particular amino acids (His-326 and His-332) of the rat SUR1 subunit, located in the first extracellular loop of TMD-1. We thank Jonathan G. Gore and Robert Lyle for help with manuscript, Anne Baron and Laurianne van Bever for support and advice during this study, and Francoise Loctin for excellent technical assistance."

PS, a critical component of γ-secretase, is responsible for the intramembranous cleavage of amyloid precursor protein and Notch. Other physiological functions have been assigned to PS without any clear identification of the mechanisms underlying these multiple biological roles. The early embryonic lethality of PS1 and PS2 double knock-out (PS1/2 null) mice prevents the evaluation of physiological roles of PS. To investigate new functions for presenilins, we performed a proteomic approach by using cells derived from PS1/2 null blastocysts and wild type controls. We identified a presenilin-dependent cell-surface binding of albumin. Binding of albumin depends on intact caveolae on the cellular surface. Abnormal caveolin 1 localization in PS1/2 null cells was associated with a loss of caveolae and an absence of caveolin 1 expression within lipid rafts. Expressing PS1 or PS2 but not the intracellular form of Notch1 in PS1/2 null cells restored normal caveolin 1 localization, demonstrating that presenilins are required for the subcellular trafficking of caveolin 1 independently from Notch activity. Despite an expression of both caveolin 1 and PS1 within lipid raft-enriched fractions after sucrose density centrifugation in wild type cells, no direct interaction between these two proteins was detected, implying that presenilins affect caveolin 1 trafficking in an indirect manner. We conclude that presenilins are required for caveolae formation by controlling transport of intracellular caveolin 1 to the plasma membrane.

Hadjantonakis A.K. Ikeda M. Zheng H. Hyslop P.S. Bernstein A. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2801-2810Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar), the role of presenilins cannot be fully examined in double knock-out mice. Therefore, we used cells derived from PS1 and PS2 double null (termed PS1/2 null) blastocysts and their WT controls (14Berechid B.E. Kitzmann M. Foltz D.R. Roach A.H. Seiffert D. Thompson L.A.

We identified a presenilin-dependent defect in albumin binding reflecting an abnormal caveolae-dependent pathway. We showed that caveolin 1 was mislocalized in PS1/2 null cells leading to abnormal caveolae formation and an absence of caveolin1 in lipid rafts. Overexpression of PSs in PS1/2 null cells was sufficient to restore normal caveolin localization and function. We could not detect any physical interaction between presenilins and caveolin 1. These results imply that presenilins are responsible, in an indirect manner, for caveolin 1 transport to the cell surface to form caveolae. Materials—On embryonic day E3.5, blastocysts were flushed from wild type or PS1+/–, PS2+/–-intercrossed mice (13Donoviel D.B. Hadjantonakis A.K. Ikeda M. Zheng H. Hyslop P.S. Bernstein A. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2801-2810Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar) into M2 medium and plated on mitotically inhibited feeder cells. Five days later, the inner cell mass was removed, trypsinized, and plated onto new feeder cells. After 12 days, the cells were replated onto gelatin-coated dishes, grown until confluent, and then maintained in embryonic stem cell media (high glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 15% fetal bovine serum, 2 mml-glutamine, 1% penicillin/streptomycin, 1× non-essential amino acids, sodium pyruvate, recombinant leukemia-inhibitory factor) on uncoated plates. For each cell line, PCR geno-typing was performed as described previously (13Donoviel D.B. Hadjantonakis A.K. Ikeda M. Zheng H. Hyslop P.S. Bernstein A.

SV40 transformation was used to generate rapidly growing cell lines as described previously (33Palacino J.J. Berechid B.E. Alexander P. Eckman C. Younkin S. Nye J.S. Wolozin B. J. Biol.

Two-dimensional Gel Electrophoresis—Total protein extracts from WT, PS1/2 null, and PS1/2 null cells transiently transfected with the presenilin 1 cDNA (blastocyst-derived and SV40-transformed blastocyst-derived cells) were analyzed by two-dimensional electrophoresis by the method of O'Farrell. The ampholine mixture used for the first dimension electrofocusing gel was composed of 60% (w/v) of ampholine, pH 5–7, and 40% of ampholine, pH 3–10. The second dimension was performed on SDS-12% polyacrylamide gels. Gels were then stained by Coomassie Blue and BSA-sequenced with a MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer (Carol Beach, University of Kentucky). Endocytosis Assays—Blastocyst-derived PS1/2 null cells and WT controls were grown in complete medium on 25-mm glass coverslips. When cells were 75–80% confluent, the medium was replaced with 2 ml of complete medium containing FITC-conjugated albumin (Sigma) at a final concentration of 10 μg/ml. Cells were incubated at 37 °C for 5 and 30 min, washed in PBS, and fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde for 10 min. The cells were washed for 20 min in PBS and mounted on a slide. Virtually identical experiments were carried out with FITC-conjugated transferrin (10 μg/ml, sigma). PS1/2 null cells were grown on 60-mm tissue culture dishes and transiently transfected with the presenilin 1 or presenilin 2 cDNA using Lipofectamine Plus (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The transfected cells were plated on 25-mm coverslips in 6-well plates after 24 h. FITC-albumin uptake was then examined in transfected cells 36 h after the initial transfection. Cells transfected with presenilin 1 or presenilin 2 were detected by immunostaining with anti-presenilin 1 pAb (oncogene) and anti-presenilin 2 pAb (oncogene), respectively, and a Texas Red-conjugated secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch). Immunofluorescence Microscopy—Transfected or untransfected blastocyst-derived PS1/2 null cells and WT controls were plated on 18-mm glass coverslips (Fisher), fixed for 10 min in PBS containing 3.7% formaldehyde, rinsed with PBS, and incubated for 2 min in permeabilization buffer (PBS, 0.1% Triton X-100). Cells were then washed with PBS and incubated for 10 min in blocking buffer (PBS, 0.5% BSA) and labeled with corresponding antibodies: anti-FLAG mAb (M2, Sigma); anti-caveolin 1 pAb (Transduction Laboratories); anti-PS1 pAb (H70, Sc Biotechnology); and anti-Myc mAb (9E10). After rinsing with PBS, secondary antibody Alexa 488 or Alexa 555 donkey anti-mouse and Alexa-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit (Molecular Probes) were added for a period of 30 min. A confocal fluorescence microscope (Olympus, North-western University, Molecular Pharmacology and Biological Chemistry, Prof. R. J. Miller's laboratory) was used for visualization of FITC-BSA and FITC-transferrin (Fig. 2 and Fig. 3B).

The cell pellet was fixed in phosphate buffer containing 3.5% glutaraldehyde overnight at 4 °C. Cells were then rinsed in phosphate buffer, post-fixed in a 2% osmic acid for 1 h at room temperature, dehydrated, embedded, and cut onto grids. Thin sections (85 nm; Leica-Reichert Ultracut E) were collected at different levels of each block and counterstained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate before visualization and photography on a Hitachi 7100 transmission electron microscope. EM was performed at the Centre Regional d'Imagerie Cellulaire of Montpellier, France. Isolation of Caveolin-enriched Membrane (CEM) and Immunoblot Assays—CEMs were prepared by detergent extraction of cellular proteins and centrifugation over discontinuous sucrose gradients essentially as described (21Bilderback T.R. Grigsby R.J. Dobrowsky R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10922-10927Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Blastocyst-derived PS1/2 null cells and WT controls were grown in 100-mm diameter dishes, and 2 × 107 cells were used to prepare the CEMs. Cells were washed twice with 10 ml of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and scraped into 2 ml of MBST buffer (25 mm MES, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, protease inhibitors mixture (Roche Applied Science)) and homogenized with a loose fitting Dounce homogenizer (20 strokes). The extract was adjusted to 40% sucrose by the addition of 2 ml of 80% sucrose in MBS lacking Triton X-100 and placed in the bottom of an ultracentrifuge tube. A discontinuous sucrose gradient was formed by overlaying this solution with 4 ml of 38% sucrose and 4 ml of 5% sucrose (both in MBS). The tubes were centrifuged at 31,000 rpm in an SW41 Ti rotor for 17 h at 4 °C, and 12 fractions of 1 ml were collected manually from the top of the gradient. To determine the distribution of different proteins within the gradients, 200 μl of each fraction were precipitated with ethanol, resuspended in 20 μl of 1× Laemmli buffer, and subjected to SDS-PAGE on 10% acrylamide gels followed by Western blot analyses. The primary antibodies used are as follows: anti-PS1 pAb (H70, Sc Biotechnology; anti-Cav1 pAb (N20, Sc Biotechnology); anti-γ-adaptin mAb (Transduction Laboratories); anti-BIP mAb (Transduction Laboratories); and anti-flotillin 1 mAb (Transduction Laboratories). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG or anti-rabbit secondary antibody (1:2000 dilution, Amersham Biosciences) was used to visualize bound primary antibodies with chemiluminescence substrate (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). In order to identify new functions for presenilins, we used a differential proteomic approach (Fig. 1). We compared the two-dimensional profile of total extracts from WT and PS1/2 null cells. Proteins of interest were those expressed in WT cells and absent in PS1/2 null cells. We performed the differential proteomic approach with SV40-transformed blastocyst-derived cells (Fig. 1A) and blastocyst-derived cells (Fig. 1B). Several proteins corresponded to the chosen criteria, and among them a strongly expressed protein was common to blastocyst-derived cells and their SV40 counterpart. This protein was sequenced with a MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer and identified as bovine serum albumin (BSA). This result shows that there is a defect in the endocytosis and/or binding of albumin from the fetal bovine serum in the absence of presenilins. Caveolae-deficient endothelial cells show defects in the uptake and transport of albumin in vivo (15Schubert W. Frank P.G. Razani B. Park D.S. Chow C.W. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol.

Caveolin 1 null mouse embryonic fibroblasts show defects in the endocytosis of albumin but not transferrin (16Razani B. Engelman J.A. Wang X.B. Schubert W. Zhang X.L. Marks C.B. Macaluso F. Russell R.G. Li M. Pestell R.G. Di Vizio D. Hou H. Kneitz B. Lagaud G.N. Christ G.J. Edelmann W. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol.

Caveolae-mediated endocytosis in endothelial cells is stimulated by the binding of albumin to a specific albumin-binding protein localized in caveolae (17Ghitescu L. Fixman A. Simionescu M. Simionescu N. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 102: 1304-1311Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Therefore, the defect of endocytosis and/or binding of albumin observed in PS1/2 null cells (Fig. 1) could be linked to the abnormal caveolae-dependent pathway. We next examined the ability of WT and PS1/2 null cells to bind/endocytose the fluorescent tracer FITC-albumin. Fig. 2 shows that PS1/2 null cells (left panel) failed to accumulate FITC-albumin even after 30 min of continuous incubation in contrast to WT cells showing cell surface labeling with FITC-albumin within 5 min of incubation. To ensure that the lack of expression from the presenilins did not globally affect ligand binding/endocytosis, we also examined the intracellular uptake of a second fluorescent tracer, FITC-transferrin, known to be endocytosed via clathrin-coated pits. As shown in Fig. 2 (right panel), FITC-transferrin was rapidly endocytosed in both WT and PS1/2 null cells. Thus, PS1/2 null cells show a selective defect in caveolae-mediated ligand binding reminiscent of that observed in caveolin 1-deficient cells (16Razani B. Engelman J.A. Wang X.B. Schubert W. Zhang X.L. Marks C.B. Macaluso F. Russell R.G. Li M. Pestell R.G. Di Vizio D. Hou H. Kneitz B. Lagaud G.N. Christ G.J. Edelmann W. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38121-38138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). To ensure that the defect in caveolae-dependent endocytosis observed in PS1/2 null cells was specifically because of a lack of PS proteins, we examined whether the transient expression of the presenilin cDNA was sufficient to restore albumin binding in PS1/2 null cells. As shown in Fig. 3A, the two-dimensional gel profile of proteins in PS1/2 null cells re-expressing PS1 was comparable with that of the corresponding WT cells (see Fig. 1). The presence of BSA was detected on Coomassie-stained two-dimensional gels of either SV40-transformed blastocyst-derived PS1/2 null cells (top) or blastocyst-derived PS1/2 null cells (bottom) overexpressing PS1. We confirmed this result by restoring efficient FITC-albumin uptake in blastocyst-derived PS1/2 null cells expressing either PS1 (Fig. 3B, top panel) or PS2 (Fig. 3B, bottom panel). These results show that caveolae functionality is dependent upon either PS1 or PS2 expression. Because the phenotype observed in PS1/2 null cells (Figs. 1, 2, 3) is reminiscent to the one observed in caveolin1-deficient cells (16Razani B. Engelman J.A. Wang X.B. Schubert W. Zhang X.L. Marks C.B. Macaluso F. Russell R.G. Li M. Pestell R.G. Di Vizio D. Hou H. Kneitz B. Lagaud G.N. Christ G.J. Edelmann W. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38121-38138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar), we wondered if caveolin 1 was expressed in PS1/2 null cells. By Western blotting, we were able to detect caveolin 1 expression in PS1/2 null cells. 2D. R. Wood, J. S. Nye, N. J. C. Lamb, A. Fernandez, and M. Kitzmann, unpublished observations. We decided to further investigate how caveolin1 was regulated in PS1/2 null cells in comparison to WT cells. We employed the following three distinct methods to address this issue. We first explored caveolin1 localization by immunofluorescence. We then observed caveolae formation by EM. Finally, we looked at the association of caveolin 1 with lipid rafts by sucrose density centrifugation. In order to evaluate caveolin 1 (Cav1) distribution between WT and PS1/2 null cells, we performed indirect immunofluorescence experiments (Fig. 4). In most of WT cells, endogenous caveolin 1 was predominantly localized at the plasma membrane with typical caveolae-associated punctated staining (Fig. 4A, I), whereas in PS1/2 null cells, endogenous caveolin 1 showed pronounced punctated perinuclear localization (Fig. 4A, II). Altered localization of caveolin 1 in PS1/2 null cells was also observed after forced expression of GFP-Cav1 (Fig. 4A, IV) and with endogenous caveolin 2. 2D. R. Wood, J. S. Nye, N. J. C. Lamb, A. Fernandez, and M. Kitzmann, unpublished observations. This result shows that there is an intracellular retention of caveolin 1 in PS1/2 null cells. To evaluate if caveolin 1 membrane localization was PS-dependent, we examined if transient expression of presenilin 2 cDNA was sufficient to induce a change in caveolin 1 localization. As shown in Fig. 4B, transient expression of FLAG-presenilin 2 (V) in PS1/2 null cells induced redistribution of endogenous caveolin 1 from its perinuclear localization (VI). Micro-injection of PS1 cDNA in GFP-Cav1 positive PS1/2 null cells (Fig. 4B, VII) allowed GFP-Cav1 to be relocalized as in WT cells (VIII). In contrast, no noticeable changes in GFP-Cav1 localization was observed after the microinjection of the Notch NICD (Fig. 4B, IX) construct in GFP-Cav1-positive PS1/2 null cells (Fig. 4B, X). These results show that caveolin 1 is mislocalized in PS1/2 null cells and that even though most of the PS1/2 null mice phenotypes are attributable to a loss of Notch 1 function (13Donoviel D.B. Hadjantonakis A.K. Ikeda M. Zheng H. Hyslop P.S. Bernstein A. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2801-2810Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar), presenilins are involved in the subcellular localization of caveolin 1 independently from Notch activity. Expression of caveolin 1 in cells lacking caveolae causes de novo formation of caveolae, whereas ablation or mislocalization of caveolin 1 expression causes a loss of caveolae (18Fra A.M. Williamson E. Simons K. Parton R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8655-8659Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar, 19Lee H. Park D.S. Razani B. Russell R.G. Pestell R.G. Lisanti M.P.

Caveolae are well defined organelles, forming flask-shaped necks at the plasma membrane easily distinguishable by electron microscopy. The presence of caveolae in PS1/2 null cells was investigated by EM. We found a marked reduced number of caveolae at the plasma membrane of presenilin-deficient cells (Fig. 5B) in comparison to WT cells (Fig. 5A). In addition, only 20% of PS1/2 null cells showed caveolae at the plasma membrane compared with 100% of WT cells. 2D. R. Wood, J. S. Nye, N. J. C. Lamb, A. Fernandez, and M. Kitzmann, unpublished observations. These data show that presenilins are involved in caveolae formation. Caveolae are a subset of specialized liquid-ordered domains, referred to as lipid rafts. Caveolae are isolated by their insolubility in Triton X-100 and their sedimentation in low density fractions over sucrose gradients (21Bilderback T.R. Grigsby R.J. Dobrowsky R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10922-10927Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). We performed isolation of CEM of WT and PS1/2 null cell proteins (see “Experimental Procedures”). It has been shown previously that caveolae-enriched fractions isolated in this manner exclude markers for caveolae membranes such as the Golgi apparatus, mitochondria, and the endoplasmic reticulum (22Lisanti M.P. Scherer P.E. Vidugiriene J. Tang Z. Hermanowski-Vosatka A. Tu Y.H. Cook R.F. Sargiacomo M. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 111-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (815) Google Scholar, 23Song K.S. Tang Z. Li S. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4398-4403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Distribution of BIP and γ-adaptin, non-raft proteins localized in the ER and the trans-Golgi, respectively, was also examined to monitor the contamination of CEM with ER and trans-Golgi membranes (Fig. 6). Flotillins have been described as a new family of proteins associated with caveolae (24Bickel P.E. Scherer P.E. Schnitzer J.E. Oh P. Lisanti M.P. Lodish H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13793-13802Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar). As expected (Fig. 6A), flotillin 1 expression was restricted to fractions 4 and 5 (CEM), implying that extraction with Triton X-100 yielded good separation of lipid rafts from BIP and γ-adaptin not detected in CEM fractions. Caveolin 1 expression was not restricted to CEM and was also found in other fractions in WT cells. As shown previously (25Lee S.J. Liyanage U. Bickel P.E. Xia W. Lansbury Jr., P.T. Kosik K.S. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 730-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar, 26Morishima-Kawashima M. Ihara Y. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 15247-15253Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 27Riddell D.R. Christie G. Hussain I. Dingwall C. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 1288-1293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar), PS1 was also concentrated in raft fractions. Caveolin 1 expression was detected in fraction 5 in WT cells (Fig. 6A) but not in PS1/2 null cells (Fig. 6B). In PS1/2 null cells, caveolin 1 was only present in fraction 7 and in high density fractions (fractions 9–12) with Triton X-100-soluble proteins. This result shows that in the absence of presenilins, caveolin 1 was not detected in the low density fractions normally enriched in caveolae (fractions 4 and 5), further supporting the fact that caveolae do not form. Most surprisingly, flotillin 1 expression was no longer associated with lipid rafts in PS1/2 null cells, implying that not only caveolae but also other lipid rafts may be affected by a deficiency in presenilins expression. In order to determine the molecular mechanism responsible for caveolin 1 mislocalization in PS1/2 null cells, we tested if presenilin 1 and caveolin 1 were able to interact with one another. Despite a co-expression of caveolin 1 and PS1 in lipid rafts (Fig. 6A), we were not able to detect any interaction between endogenous presenilin 1 and caveolin 1 by immunoprecipitation in WT cells2 either from total extract or from CEM fractions. Altogether these results show that PS1 or PS2 expression is required for a correct localization of caveolin 1 in caveolae at the plasma membrane but that the absence of presenilins may affect other protein(s) directly implicated in caveolin 1 sorting. In this paper we performed a differential proteomic approach using blastocyst-derived WT and PS1/2 null cells in order to identify new roles of presenilins beyond Alzheimer's disease. By using this approach, we identified a presenilin-dependent caveolin 1 localization leading to an absence of caveolae when presenilins are missing. Caveolin 1 can be now added to the list of proteins with a presenilin-dependent trafficking. We observed an intracellular retention of caveolin 1 in PS1/2 null cells (Fig. 4). The perinuclear localization of caveolin 1 in PS1/2 null cells partially co-localized with γ-adaptin by immunofluorescence.2 In these experiments, caveolin 1 was more broadly distributed than γ-adaptin. The precise localization of caveolin 1 in the absence of presenilins needs further investigation. The mechanism by which presenilins, such as chaperone proteins, will allow the correct caveolin 1 localization and caveolae formation does not involve a complex between caveolin 1 and presenilin and is independent from Notch 1 signaling (Fig. 4). Flotillin 1 always targets to the lipid raft/caveolae fractions independent of the presence of caveolin (28Capozza F. Cohen A.W. Cheung M.W. Razani B. Sotgia F. Schubert W. Battista M. Lee H. Frank P.G. Lisanti M.P. Am. J Physiol. 2004; (in press)Google Scholar). Thus, the absence of flotillin 1 from lipid raft fractions in PS1/2 null cells is not because of caveolin 1 mislocalization, implying that the mechanism by which presenilins transport raft proteins to lipid rafts is more global and may directly affect a common protein involved in the targeting of raft-associated proteins to lipid rafts. Lipid rafts are multifunctional organelles playing important roles in a variety of cellular processes, and in this work, we pointed to an important new role for presenilins. Neurons do not form caveolae but form lipid rafts with caveolae-type structures. APP was found in membrane fractions with caveolae-like properties (29Bouillot C. Prochiantz A. Rougon G. Allinquant B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7640-7644Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), suggesting that caveolae-type structures might be important in the manifestation of AD. Moreover, targeting β-secretase to lipid rafts was shown to up-regulate β-site processing of APP (30Cordy J.M. Hussain I. Dingwall C. Hooper N.M. Turner A.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 11735-11740Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar), and presenilins were found highly enriched in caveolin-3-positive caveolae in astrocytes surrounding senile plaques (31Nishiyama K. Trapp B.D. Ikezu T. Ransohoff R.M. Tomita T. Iwatsubo T. Kanazawa I. Hsiao K.K. Lisanti M.P. Okamoto T. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 6538-6548Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, γ-secretase complex was shown to be localized in lipid raft microdomains of post-Golgi and endosomes (32Vetrivel K.S. Cheng H. Lin W. Sakurai T. Li T. Nukina N. Wong P.C. Xu H. Thinakaran G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 44945-44954Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). We can thus postulate that in neurons, presenilins may be implicated in the trafficking of proteins such as flotillin 1, which is responsible for lipid raft formation. These lipid rafts would form the best environment for γ-secretase activity. A better understanding of how γ-secretase complex is formed and transported to the cell membrane may lead to the development of new pharmacological strategies to specifically target the cleavage of APP and delay the progress of AD.

Screening of potential inhibitors using recombinant IN-based assays has revealed a number of promising leads including nucleotide analogs such as pyridoxal 5′-phosphate (PLP). Certain PLP derivatives were shown to also exhibit antiviral activities in cell-based assays. To identify an inhibitory binding site of PLP to IN, we used the intrinsic chemical property of this compound to form a Schiff base with a primary amine in the protein at the nucleotide binding site. The amino acid affected was then revealed by mass spectrometric analysis of the proteolytic peptide fragments of IN. We found that an IC50 concentration (15 μm) of PLP modified a single IN residue, Lys244, located in the C-terminal domain. In fact, we observed a correlation between interaction of PLP with Lys244 and the compound's ability to impair formation of the IN·DNA complex. Site-directed mutagenesis studies confirmed an essential role of Lys244 for catalytic activities of recombinant IN and viral replication. Molecular modeling revealed that Lys244 together with several other DNA binding residues provides a plausible pocket for a nucleotide inhibitor-binding site. To our knowledge, this is the first report indicating that a small molecule inhibitor can impair IN activity through its binding to the protein C terminus. At the same time, our findings highlight the importance of structural analysis of the full-length protein. HIV-1 integrase (IN) is an important target for designing new antiviral therapies.

In this regard, HIV-1 integrase (IN), which has no known human counterparts, is an attractive target. Furthermore, the fact that IN uses a common active site for 3′-processing and DNA strand transfer may constrain the range of mutations that can contribute to evolution of viable drug-resistant viruses. HIV-1 IN catalyzes integration of the viral DNA, made by reverse transcription, into the host chromosome in a two-step reaction (reviewed in Ref. 1Brown P.O. Coffin J.M. Hughes S.H. Varmus H.E. Retroviruses. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1997: 161-204Google Scholar). In the first step, called 3′-processing, two nucleotides are removed at each 3′-end of the viral DNA. In the next step, called DNA strand transfer, concerted transesterification reactions integrate the viral DNA ends into the host genome. HIV-1 IN is composed of three distinct structural and functional domains: the N-terminal domain (residues 1–50) that contains the HHCC zinc-binding motif, the core domain (residues 51–212) that contains the catalytic site, and the C-terminal domain (residues 213–270) that is thought to provide a platform for DNA binding. Crystallographic or NMR structural data are available for each of the individual domains (2Cai M. Zheng R. Caffrey M. Craigie R. Clore G.M. Gronenborn A.M. Nat. Struct.

However, efforts to obtain a structure of the full-length protein have been impeded by poor protein solubility. Purified IN-based assays have been employed for screening of potential inhibitors.

Much effort has been devoted to dissecting the mechanism of inhibition and identifying the inhibitor binding sites. Crystallographic studies revealed two distinct binding sites in IN including the catalytic site for a diketo group-containing inhibitor (1-(5-chloroindol-3-yl)-3-hydroxy-3-(2H-tetrazol-5-yl)-propenone) and a site located near the IN dimer interface for 3,4-dihydroxyphenyltriphenylarsonium bromide (23Goldgur Y.

Mass spectrometry is a powerful structural biology tool that allows the analysis of protein-inhibitor complexes under biologically relevant conditions and provides structural information complementary to NMR and crystallography. For example, we recently reported identification of a small molecule inhibitor binding site to full-length IN using the affinity acetylation and mass spectrometric analysis approach (25Shkriabai N.

These experiments were performed at low protein concentrations, where full-length IN as well as its complexes with inhibitor and DNA were fully soluble. In the present study, our efforts focused on interactions of a known nucleotide inhibitor, pyridoxal 5′-phosphate (PLP) with IN. Our interest in this compound was prompted for the following reasons. PLP has been previously shown to inhibit IN activity at low micromolar range (15Lipford J.R. Worland S.T. Farnet C.M. J. Acquired Immune Defic. Syndr. 1994; 7: 1215-1223PubMed Google Scholar, 16Mazumder A. Neamati N. Sommadossi J.P. Gosselin G. Schinazi R.F. Imbach J.L. Pommier Y. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 49: 621-628PubMed Google Scholar). More recently, certain PLP-derivatives were shown to exhibit potent antiviral activities in cell culture assays (26.Sauve, G., and Stranix, B. R. (October 28, 2003) U. S. Patent 6,638,921Google Scholar). In addition, PLP is known to form a Schiff base with the primary amine in the protein at the nucleotide-binding site (27Lundblad R.L. Techniques in Protein Modification. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1995Google Scholar). This intrinsic property coupled with mass spectrometric analysis could be exploited for determination of a nucleotide binding site in IN. Furthermore, protein interactions with the phosphate group of PLP could mimic that with the phosphate backbone of DNA. Finding the contact amino acids would benefit longstanding efforts in the field to define the DNA substrate binding cleft in HIV-1 IN. Indeed, our results reported here reveal a new plausible nucleotide-binding pocket in the protein. In particular, using mass spectrometry, we identified Lys244 as a primary binding site of PLP. The importance of this amino acid for the IN function and for viral replication was confirmed by site-directed mutagenesis. Preparation of Recombinant Wild Type and K244E Mutant HIV-1 Integrase Proteins—pET-15b-IN1–288 (F185K/C280S) was expressed in E. coli strain BL21 as described previously (28Jenkins T.M. Engelman A. Ghirlando R. Craigie R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7712-7718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). This plasmid was also used to introduce K244E mutation. For mutagenesis, we followed a Stratagene protocol using the QuikChange XL site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) and appropriate DNA oligonucleotides obtained from Integrated DNA Technologies (Coralville, IA). The presence of the desired mutation and the absence of undesired mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing and further verified by mass spectrometric analysis of the recombinant protein. The proteins were purified by a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-Sepharose chromatography column as described previously (28Jenkins T.M. Engelman A. Ghirlando R. Craigie R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7712-7718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). The fractions containing wild-type or K244E mutant protein were dialyzed against 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 1 m NaCl, 100 μm ZnCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol (DTT), and 10% glycerol. Purified proteins were divided into separate aliquots and frozen in liquid nitrogen. The aliquots were thawed only once and used immediately. IN Activity—3′-Processing and strand transfer activities were assayed in the reaction buffer containing 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm MnCl2, 2 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm CHAPS, 50 nm32P-labeled DNA substrate (21-mer blunt ended double-stranded DNA mimicking the U5 sequence), and 1 μm IN. The reaction products were separated by 20% denaturing PAGE and visualized by a PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences). IN·DNA Photocross-linking—The protocol for specific photocross-linking of IN to cognate DNA substrate was adopted from Esposito and Craigie (29Esposito D. Craigie R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5832-5843Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). HIV-1 U5 LTR sequence containing DNA oligonucleotide (5′-GTGTGGAAAATCTCTAGCAGT-3′) was annealed to the complementary DNA strand in which 5-iododeoxyuracil (IdU) was incorporated instead of the 5′-terminal adenine residue (5′-IdUCTGCTAGAGATTTTCCACAC-3′). The hybridized DNA substrates were radioactively labeled, purified through a Sephadex G25 desalting column, and used for cross-linking reactions. The reaction contained 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.8, 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm MnCl2,10mm DTT, 20 nm DNA substrate, and 1 μm integrase. Samples were first incubated for 15 min at room temperature and then irradiated with 302-nm light from a handheld ultraviolet lamp for 30 min. The cross-linked products were analyzed by SDS-PAGE with NuPage 4–12% MOPS gels (Novex, Inc.). Quantitation of reaction products was carried out using a PhosphorImager and ImageQuant software (Amersham Biosciences). Formation and Mass Spectrometric Analysis of the IN·Pyridoxal 5′-Phosphate Complex—The reaction mixture containing 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.8, 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm MnCl2, 10 mm DTT, 1 μm IN was incubated with varying concentrations of PLP at 37 °C for 30 min. Sodium borohydride (5 mm final concentration) was added subsequently to reduce the Schiff base formed upon the PLP interaction with a primary amine. The protein was then unfolded by adding 40 mm DTT and incubating at 70 °C for 20 min. To modify cysteine residues, the reaction mixture was complemented with 100 mm iodoacetamide and incubated at 37 °C for 45 min. The reaction was quenched by the addition of 100 mm DTT. The modified protein samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE. The IN band was excised and subjected to in-gel proteolysis using 0.5 μg of one of the following three proteases: trypsin, LysC, or GluC (Roche Applied Science). Trypsin and LysC digestions were performed in 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate buffer, pH 8.0, at 37 °C for 16 h. GluC proteolysis was carried out in 50 mm ammonium acetate, pH 4.0, at 25 °C for 16 h. The proteolytic peptide fragments were desiccated in a SpeedVac (Thermo Savant, Holbrook, NY) and resuspended in an aqueous solution of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. MS and MS/MS analyses of proteolytic peptide fragments were carried out using a Micromass Q-TOF-II instrument equipped with an electrospray source and a micromass cap-LC. Peptides were separated with a Waters Symmetry300 C18 precolumn and a Micro-Tech Scientific VC-10-C18–150 column using two sequential linear gradients of 5–40 and 40–90% acetonitrile for 35 and 10 min, respectively. MS/MS analysis data and the Mascot search engine (www.matrixscience.com) were used to identify IN peptide peaks from the NCBInr primary sequence data base. Preparation and in Vivo Analysis of K244E Mutant—Together with the K244E mutation, we also analyzed HIV-1 NL4–3 viruses encoding wild type and D116N mutant IN as positive and negative controls, respectively. A 4.3-kb fragment of the NL4–3 vector spanning the SpeI and EcoRI sites was generated and subcloned into pBluescript SK(+) (Stratagene). Appropriate DNA oligonucleotides to introduce the K244E or D116N mutation were purchased from Integrated DNA Technologies (Coralville, IA). Preparation of mutant plasmids was carried out according to the Stratagene protocol using QuikChange XL site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). After confirming the mutation by DNA sequencing, the SpeI-EcoRI fragments were inserted back into the NL4–3 vector. In vitro virus stock preparation and viral infectivity determination were carried out as follows. 293T cells (ATCC) were maintained in the presence of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Cellgro), 10% fetal calf serum (HyClone Laboratories), penicillin (50 units/ml; Invitrogen), and streptomycin (50 μg/ml; Invitrogen) and plated at a density of 5 × 106 cells/100-mm-diameter culture dish. After overnight incubation with 5% CO2 at 37 °C, the cells were transfected using an MBS mammalian transfection kit (Stratagene) with 10 μg of HIV-1 NL4–3 plasmid DNA encoding wild-type and mutant (K244E or D116N) IN. Cell culture supernatant was replaced with fresh medium 6 h after transfection and further cultured for a total of 48 h. Thereafter, cell culture supernatants containing viruses were harvested, clarified through a 0.45-μm membrane filter (Nalgene), aliquoted, and stored at -80 °C. In a separate experiment, 293T cells were also co-transfected with 10 μg of plasmid DNAs together with 1 μg of plasmid DNA of pHCMV-G expressing vesiculostomatitis virus envelope glycoprotein G (30Yee J.K. Miyanohara A. LaPorte P. Bouic K. Burns J.C. Friedmann T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9564-9568Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). The viral supernatant was cleared and concentrated 40-fold by centrifugation at 25,000 rpm for 90 min at 4 °C. The concentrated virus pellet was resuspended and digested in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 10 mm MgCl2, and 300 units/ml RNase-free DNase I (Roche Applied Science) for 60 min at room temperature. The viral p24 capsid protein amounts in the virus stocks were determined by using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (p24 Core Profile Kit; DuPont). Human osteosarcoma cell line, GHOST (3Dyda F. Hickman A.B. Jenkins T.M. Engelman A. Craigie R. Davies D.R. Science. 1994; 266: 1981-1986Crossref PubMed Scopus (705) Google Scholar) R3/X4/R5 (National Institutes of Health AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program) transduced by HIV-2 LTR-GFP expressing both CD4 and CCR5 receptor were maintained in the same growth medium as 293T cells but with the additional selective reagents of G418 (500 μg/ml), hygromycin (1 μg/ml), and puromycin (1 μg/ml) (31Morner A. Bjorndal A. Albert J. Kewalramani V.N. Littman D.R. Inoue R. Thorstensson R. Fenyo E.M. Bjorling E. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 2343-2349Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The cells were plated at a density of 1 × 105 in 0.5 ml of medium/well of a 24-well plate and cultured overnight under the conditions described above. Unconcentrated virus supernatants containing a range of 100–400 ng of p24 were added in duplicates and cultured for a total of 40 h. The cells were trypsinized off of the plate and inactivated by 1% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline. A total of 10,000 events representing cells were acquired through flow cytometry to measure the percentage of GFP-positive cells. Thereafter, the percentage of GFP-positive cells was normalized to 100 ng of p24 equivalent viral inoculum. Viral DNA Quantitation by Real Time PCR—CEMx174, the T and B lymphoid hybrid cell line (National Institutes of Health AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program), was maintained in the presence of RPMI 1640 medium (Cellgro), 10% fetal calf serum (HyClone Laboratories), penicillin (50 units/ml; Invitrogen), and streptomycin (50 μg/ml; Invitrogen). 2 × 105 of CEMx174 cells in 0.5 ml of medium were infected by adding a 10-ng equivalent of p24 inoculum of vesiculostomatitis virus envelope glycoprotein G pseudotyped HIV-1 NL4-3 encoding wild-type and mutant (K244E or D116N) IN. Immediately and 12 h after infection, the cells were harvested, and total cellular DNA was extracted (QIAmp DNA Blood Mini Kit; Qiagen) and dissolved in water. DNAs extracted from cells immediately after infection were used as a background control for the carryover plasmid DNA derived from the transfection procedure. The extracted DNAs were used in a real time PCR to quantitatively detect viral late reverse transcription product (U5-Ψ) and cellular DNA. The late reverse transcription product U5-Ψ DNA was quantified as described previously (32Butler S.L. Hansen M.S. Bushman F.D. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 631-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar, 33Svarovskaia E.S. Barr R. Zhang X. Pais G.C. Marchand C. Pommier Y. Burke Jr., T.R. Pathak V.K. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 3210-3222Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The following primer and probe sets were employed in the real time PCR assay to detect DNA products. For the late reverse transcription product U5-Ψ, the primer-probe sets were ES531 (5′-TGTGTGCCCGTCTGTTGTGT-3′), ES532 (5′-GAGTCCTGCGTCGAGAGATC-3′), and probe LRT-P (5′-6-carboxyfluorscein (FAM)-CAGTGGCGCCCGAACAGGGA-carboxytetramethylrhodamine (TAMRA)-3′) (32Butler S.L. Hansen M.S. Bushman F.D. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 631-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar). The PBGD primer-probe sets consisted of the forward primer DF3 (5′-AGGGCAGGAACCAGGGATTATG-3′), the reverse primer DR1 (5′-GGGCACCACACTCTCCTATCTTT-3′), and the probe PBGD (5′-ATGTCCACCACAGGGGACAAGATTC-3′). All real time PCRs were performed using the TaqMan Universal PCR Master Mix Kit (Roche Applied Science), and the products were quantified using the ABI Prism sequence detector 7700. Primers were used at 600 nm, and probes were used at 75 nm concentration. The conditions used for real time PCRs were as follows: one cycle at 50 °C for 2 min, one cycle at 95 °C for 10 min, and 40 cycles of amplification at 95 °C for 0.15 min and 60 °C for 1 min. Molecular Modeling—In order to better understand the binding mode and interactions of PLP with HIV-1 IN, a structural model of PLP complexed with full-length HIV-1 IN dimer was generated. Based on our experimental results and reported crystal structures of PLP complexed with different proteins in the protein data bank (34Berman H.M. Westbrook J. Feng Z. Gilliland G. Bhat T.N. Weissig H. Shindyalov I.N. Bourne P.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 235-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (26214) Google Scholar), the IN·PLP complex was modeled as a covalent interaction between Lys244 and PLP by adding a bond between terminal NH2 of Lys244 and aldehyde carbonyl of PLP. The complex was then subjected to quenched molecular dynamics simulations using the Insight II 2000.0/Discover 97.0 modeling package (Molecular Simulations Inc., San Diego, CA), using the cff91 force field. Additional parameters for Mg2+ were determined using its ionic radius and small molecule crystallographic data. A dielectric constant of 1.00 and the cell multipole method with fine accuracy were used for all nonbonding interactions except for the quenched molecular dynamics. The quenched molecular dynamics cycle consisted of 100 ps of molecular dynamics simulation at 800 K in an NVT ensemble, keeping all protein atoms beyond 15 Å of PLP fixed. The van der Waals interactions were scaled to 2%, and the coulombic interactions were scaled to 20%. The coordinates were saved every 200 fs and subsequently minimized by 300 steps of the Polak-Ribiere conjugate gradient algorithm. The lowest energy conformation of the 500 minimized structures is depicted in Fig. 7A. The electrostatic potential on the solvent-accessible surface of the full-length IN dimer and PLP was calculated using the Delphi module in the Insight II program and is depicted in Fig. 7B. The default Delphi formal charges were applied for the protein, whereas ab initio calculation with Gaussian 98 A11 was used to obtain charges for PLP. To map the PLP binding site of HIV-1 IN, we exploited an intrinsic property of PLP to form a Schiff base with primary amines. The compound can be tethered covalently to the adjacent lysine by subsequent reduction of a Schiff base with sodium borohydride. Of note, lysine is the most abundant residue in HIV-1 IN, providing an excellent environment for detailed analysis of an inhibitor-binding site. Proteolytic hydrolysis coupled with mass spectrometric analysis yielded complete coverage of the full-length protein amino acid sequence, enabling us to monitor all of the lysine residues present in HIV-1 IN (Fig. 1). To identify an inhibitory PLP binding site we examined IN interaction with a 15 μm concentration of the compound. This concentration was chosen because under our reaction conditions PLP inhibited 3′-processing and strand transfer activities with a comparable IC50 value of ∼15 μm. Interestingly, mass spectrometric analysis of tryptic peptide fragments of the IN·PLP complex revealed that a single new peak was formed when compared with free IN digests (Fig. 2). The molecular weight of this peak corresponded to the molecular weight of IN peptide amino acids 241–258 plus one molecule of PLP. This peptide contains two lysine residues, Lys244 and Lys258. Lys244, located within the peptide, was resistant to tryptic digestion. In contrast, Lys258, located at the peptide C terminus, was readily hydrolyzed by trypsin. Normally, unmodified lysine residues in proteins are easily cleaved by trypsin, whereas modified lysines become resistant to proteolysis. Conclusive evidence for Lys244 modification by PLP emerged from MS/MS analysis (Fig. 3). Indeed, series of y ions (y2, y4–y9) indicated that Lys258 did not contain any modified groups, whereas detection of ions b9, b10, and y17 enabled us to localize the modification site to Lys244. This lysine was the only modified residue observed in the presence of 15 μm PLP. Several additional surface-exposed lysines were modified when the PLP concentration was increased to 200 μm. However, detailed quantitative analysis of the modified peaks showed that even at such a high concentration (200 μm) of PLP, the primary site of modification remained Lys244. Lys244 is located in the C-terminal domain of the enzyme. This domain is thought to be important for coordinating DNA and is significantly distanced from the catalytic site of IN. Therefore, we next examined whether modification of Lys244 could interfere with formation of the IN·DNA complex. For this, we chose to employ the specific DNA substrate containing IdU at the 5′-end of the HIV-1 U5 LTR sequence. This particular DNA has been previously shown to cross-link with Gln148 located in the core domain near the catalytic site of HIV IN (35Jenkins T.M. Esposito D. Engelman A. Craigie R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6849-6859Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Thus, using this setup, we could monitor the specific DNA binding to IN without PLP directly interfering with the cross-linking site or chemistry. The results depicted in Fig. 4 show that PLP impairs DNA binding with an IC50 value of about 12 μm. In fact, there is a correlation between modification of Lys244 with PLP (Fig. 2), inhibition of the IN catalytic activities, and specific IN·DNA binding (Fig. 4). To confirm an essential role of Lys244 for the HIV-1 IN function, we performed in vivo and in vitro analyses of the K244E mutation. The results of in vivo analysis are depicted in Fig. 5. A reporter cell line Ghost-R3/X5/R5 was infected with the wild type and mutant (K244E or D116N) viruses. This cell line expresses HIV-1 receptors and was also transduced by HIV-2 LTR-GFP. Once the cells are infected by HIV-1, the integrated viral genome will express Tat protein that will subsequently transactivate LTR-driven GFP expression. Therefore, the percentage of GFP-positive cells provides a measure of the infectivity of a virus. When normalized at a 100-ng equivalent of p24 inoculum, HIV-1 NL4–3 wild type"
https://openalex.org/W1980444517,"Proteolytic processing is a primary means of biological control. Exopeptidases use terminal anchoring interactions to restrict cleavage at peptide substrate N or C termini. In contrast, internal peptide bond targeting by endopeptidases is through context-driven recognition. Angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE), a zinc metalloproteinase, has tandem duplicate catalytic domains, N- and C-terminal, each of which is a dual specificity enzyme with exo- and endocarboxypeptidase activities. The mechanisms by which ACE evolved from its endopeptidase ancestors as a dual specificity enzyme have not been defined. Based on kinetic studies of wild-type and mutant forms of the C-terminal catalytic domain of human ACE and of the ACE substrates angiotensin I, substance P, and bradykinin, as well as considerations of the ACE x-ray structure, we provide evidence that the acquisition of its exopeptidase activity is due to novel evolutionary specializations. These involve not only interactions between the S2′ subsite cognate for the C-terminal substrate P2′ side chain, acting in concert with carboxylate-docking interactions with Lys1087 and Tyr1096, but also electrostatic selection against a cationic C-terminal substrate carboxylate. With a blocked C terminus, substrate side chain interactions are dominant in cleavage site selection. In the evolution of obligate exopeptidases from endopeptidase ancestors, mutations that destroy context-driven peptide bond targeting are likely to have followed the acquisition of terminal docking interactions. Evolutionary intermediates between endopeptidases and obligate exopeptidases could therefore have been dual specificity proteinases like ACE.

Angiotensin (Ang) 1The abbreviations used are: Ang, angiotensin; ACE, angiotensin I-converting enzyme; h-ACE, human angiotensin I-converting enzyme; C-domain, C-terminal domain; Sub P, substance P; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography. I-converting enzyme (ACE; EC 3.4.15.1) is a zinc metalloproteinase of the gluzincin family. ACE has a unique chloride activation mechanism that has been identified in life forms from invertebrates to mammals (1Corvol P. Eyries M. Soubrier F. Barrett A.J. Rawlings N.D. Woessner J.F. Handbook of Proteolytic Enzymes. 2nd Ed. Academic Press, Inc., New York2004: 332-346Crossref Scopus (76) Google Scholar). An internal duplication in the ancestral ACE gene resulted in a molecule with two catalytic domains, N- and C-terminal. Most mammalian tissues contain ACE with two catalytic domains; however, the use of an internal promoter has additionally led to the expression of an ACE with a single catalytic domain (C-domain) in the testis (1Corvol P. Eyries M. Soubrier F. Barrett A.J. Rawlings N.D. Woessner J.F. Handbook of Proteolytic Enzymes. 2nd Ed. Academic Press, Inc., New York2004: 332-346Crossref Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Vertebrate ACE is a type I membrane protein; its catalytic domains are extracellular (1Corvol P. Eyries M. Soubrier F. Barrett A.J. Rawlings N.D. Woessner J.F. Handbook of Proteolytic Enzymes. 2nd Ed. Academic Press, Inc., New York2004: 332-346Crossref Scopus (76) Google Scholar). ACE primarily cleaves a C-terminal dipeptide from substrates and is also known as peptidyl dipeptidase A. Important physiological substrates of ACE are Ang I and bradykinin. Ang I is hydrolyzed by ACE to form the potent vasopressor octapeptide Ang II. Bradykinin is inactivated by ACE, thus abrogating its vasodilatory function (1Corvol P. Eyries M. Soubrier F. Barrett A.J. Rawlings N.D. Woessner J.F. Handbook of Proteolytic Enzymes. 2nd Ed. Academic Press, Inc., New York2004: 332-346Crossref Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Thus, by regulating Ang II and bradykinin levels, ACE plays a critical role in cardiovascular homeostasis, and its inhibitors are effective and widely used drugs for the treatment of hypertension and heart failure (2Acharya K.R. Sturrock E.D. Riordan J.F. Ehlers M.R. Nat. Rev. Drug Discovery. 2003; 2 (M. R. W.): 891-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). ACE also hydrolyzes a wide range of polypeptide substrates, including substance P (Sub P), luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone, acetyl-Ser-Asp-Lys-Pro, and neurotensin (1Corvol P. Eyries M. Soubrier F. Barrett A.J. Rawlings N.D. Woessner J.F. Handbook of Proteolytic Enzymes. 2nd Ed. Academic Press, Inc., New York2004: 332-346Crossref Scopus (76) Google Scholar). In contrast to Ang I and bradykinin, the C termini of Sub P and luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone are amidated. Studies by Skidgel et al. (3Skidgel R.A. Engelbrecht S. Johnson A.R. Erdo ̈s E.G. Peptides (N.Y.). 1984; 5: 769-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar), Cascieri et al. (4Cascieri M.A. Bull H.G. Mumford R.A. Patchett A.A. Thornberry N.A. Liang T. Mol. Pharmacol. 1984; 25: 287-293PubMed Google Scholar) and Yokosawa et al. (5Yokosawa H. Endo S. Ogura Y. Ishii S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1983; 116: 735-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) were the first to show that, for substrates with amidated C termini, ACE not only displays exopeptidase (i.e. dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase) activity, but also acts as an endopeptidase. Given that many metalloproteinases closely related to ACE, such as neprilysin and endothelin-converting enzyme, are endopeptidases (6Turner A.J. Barrett A.J. Rawlings N.D. Woessner J.F. Handbook of Proteolytic Enzymes. 2nd Ed. Academic Press, Inc., New York2004: 419-426Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 7Ahn K. Johnson G.D. Barrett A.J. Rawlings N.D. Woessner J.F. Handbook of Proteolytic Enzymes. 2nd Ed. Academic Press, Inc., New York2004: 429-434Crossref Scopus (5) Google Scholar), it is likely that ACE evolved from an endopeptidase ancestor. Moreover, given that ACE retains endopeptidase activity, evolution of its carboxypeptidase activity is not due to acquisition of a confined substrate-binding cleft that can accommodate substrates with only a dipeptide-leaving group C-terminal to the scissile bond. Rather, it is generally believed that evolutionary acquisition of C-terminal carboxylate-docking residues in the ACE substrate-binding site stabilize the ground state so that registration of substrates with a C-terminal carboxylate is restricted to only a solitary mode that limits substrate processing to cleavage of the C-terminal dipeptide. The recent high resolution structure determined for the human ACE (h-ACE) C-domain co-crystallized with lisinopril (its transition-state inhibitor) bound revealed close molecular contacts, both direct and indirect, between Lys1087 and Tyr1096 and the carboxylate group (equivalent to the C-terminal carboxylate group of peptide substrates) of the inhibitor (8Natesh R. Schwager S.L. Sturrock E.D. Acharya K.R. Nature. 2003; 421: 551-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (697) Google Scholar). Using site-specific mutagenesis and a variety of ACE substrates, we examined the role of the carboxylate-docking interactions in effecting substrate registration and in stabilizing the ground and transition states of the h-ACE C-domain. We show novel evolutionary specializations that, in concert with carboxylate-docking interactions, reinforce the dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase activity of the h-ACE C-domain. Construction of the h-ACE C-domain Gene—An h-ACE C-domain gene with unique restriction sites was chemically synthesized and cloned into the expression vector pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) as described by us previously (9Liu X. Fernandez M. Wouters M.A. Heyberger S. Husain A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33518-33525Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The synthetic gene encodes (in the following order) amino acids 1–29 (signal peptide), a 31-residue c-Myc epitope sequence recognized by a commercially available anti-c-Myc antibody (9E10, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), and residues 611–1201 of human somatic ACE. This synthetic gene does not include the transmembrane sequence found in somatic ACE. Mutations were constructed in the synthetic gene by site-directed mutagenesis and confirmed by DNA sequence analysis. Expression and Purification of the Recombinant h-ACE C-domain Gene and Its Mutants—COS-7 cells (American Type Culture Collection) were cultured and transfected as described previously (9Liu X. Fernandez M. Wouters M.A. Heyberger S. Husain A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33518-33525Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were cultured under an atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37 °C and transfected with plasmid DNA using the Gene Pulser system (Bio-Rad). Twelve hours after transfection, cells were washed and further cultured in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) for 72 h. Conditioned medium obtained from cells expressing and releasing the h-ACE C-domain or its mutants was collected and used as the starting point of the purification. The following ACE C-domain mutations were made: Y1096F, K1087A, R1098Q, and K1087A/Y1096F. h-ACE and its mutants were purified by ion-exchange HPLC using a Bio-Scale Q2 column (Bio-Rad) as described previously (9Liu X.

Briefly, conditioned medium containing the h-ACE C-domain or its mutants was dialyzed against 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) containing 20 mm NaCl. The dialyzed medium (5–10 ml) was applied to a Bio-Scale Q2 column, which was developed using a 45-min linear NaCl gradient (20–500 mm) at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Two 1-ml fractions with the highest activity were pooled. The purity of recombinant ACE in the pooled peak fractions was ≈50%, with bovine serum albumin as the only detectable contaminant. ACE was not further purified to remove the contaminating bovine serum albumin since the stability of the pure ACE C-domain at 4 °C was markedly lower than that of partially purified ACE containing bovine serum albumin. Determination of Kinetic Constants for the h-ACE-Ang I Reaction—To determine Km (Michaelis constant) and Vmax (maximal velocity) values for the h-ACE C-domain and its mutants, initial velocities (v) were determined as described by us previously (9Liu X. Fernandez M. Wouters M.A. Heyberger S. Husain A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33518-33525Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Twelve concentrations of substrate (Ang I or its analogs; ranging between 7.5 and 150 μm) were incubated with the wild-type h-ACE C-domain or its mutants (K1087A, Y1096F, R1098Q, and K1087A/Y1096F) at 37 °C in 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.5) containing 50 mm NaCl and 10 mm ZnSO4 (final volume of 50 μl) for 30–45 min. For each peptide substrate, the enzyme concentration was adjusted to ensure that <15% of the substrate was utilized at the lowest substrate concentration. Under these conditions, product formation was linear with respect to time over the duration of the incubation. As described previously (9Liu X. Fernandez M. Wouters M.A. Heyberger S. Husain A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33518-33525Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), C18 reversed-phase HPLC was used to analyze products formed from Ang I and its analogs. These analyses revealed cleavage of the Phe8–Xaa9 bond in the substrate, but the absence of cleavage at other sites. Km and Vmax values were calculated (using nonlinear regression with KaleidaGraph (Synergy Software, Reading, PA)) using v = (Vmax × [S])(Km + [S]), where [S] is the concentration of the peptide substrate. The overall rate constant kcat was calculated using kcat = Vmax × [E]0, where [E]0 is the total enzyme concentration and was determined by Western blot analyses using pure h-ACE C-domain as a standard. Values represent means ± S.E. of triplicate determinations. ΔΔGbinding, ΔΔGcatalysis, and ΔΔGT‡ were calculated as described by Wells (10Wells J.A. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 8509-8517Crossref PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar) and represent the difference between wild-type and mutant enzymes in free energy required to form the enzyme-substrate complex (E·S) from E + S, to convert the E·S complex to the transition-state complex (E·S‡), and to stabilize the transition-state complex (i.e. difference in free energy required to reach E·S‡ from E + S), respectively. Assays with inhibitors were performed in 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.5) containing 50 mm NaCl and 10 μm ZnSO4 at 37 °C with 40 μm [Phe9]Ang I as substrate in a total volume of 50 μl; the incubation period was 30 min. Prior to the addition of substrate (5 μl), the enzyme was preincubated with inhibitors for 30 min. Ki values were determined from plots of enzyme activity versus inhibitor concentration, where inhibitor concentration was corrected using the Km and concentration of the substrate used for the competition (Ki = IC50/(1 + ([S]/Km))). Study of Sub P, Sub P Free Acid, [Arg11]Sub P, and Bradykinin Degradation Profiles and Rates with the h-ACE C-domain and Its Mutants K1087A, Y1096F, and K1087A/Y1096F—Hydrolysis of Sub P and its analogs by the h-ACE C-domain and its mutants was studied by incubating each enzyme (between 2 and 10 ng) with each substrate (initial concentration of ≈125 μm) for 0, 5, 10, 20, and 30 min at 37 °C. The reaction buffer was 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.5) containing 50 mm NaCl and 10 mm ZnSO4 (final volume of 60 μl). Reactions were terminated by the addition of 60 μl of 0.25% trifluoroacetic acid, and the fragmentation pattern was analyzed by subjecting the reaction mixture to HPLC separation of substrate and products using a C18 reversed-phase column (XTerra RP18 3.5-μm 4.6 × 50-mm column; Waters Corp., Milford, MA). HPLC columns were developed using 8-min linear acetonitrile gradients containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. Sub P fragment peaks were collected, and their identity was determined by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis using Analyst QS software and/or by establishing their HPLC elution position relative to that of pure synthetic standards. Reaction products that did not elute with the injection artifact were quantified by comparing their peak areas with those of known quantities of pure standards, including Sub P-(1–7), Sub P-(1–8), Sub P-(1–9), and Sub P-(3–11). Enzyme concentration was adjusted such that ≈20% of the substrate was degraded in a 20-min incubation. Rates of product formation from three independent incubations were calculated as picomoles of product formed per nanogram of enzyme in 20 min, and values are presented as means ± S.E. The Sub P-(1–9) fragment was formed and subsequently degraded in these reactions to Sub P-(1–7) by the h-ACE C-domain via consecutive dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase cleavages. Thus, dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase activity was estimated by adding the rates of formation of Sub P-(1–9) and Sub P-(1–7) (see Fig. 1). Tripeptidyl carboxypeptidase and endopeptidase activities were estimated by determining the rate of Sub P-(1–8) and Sub P-(3–11) formation, respectively (see Fig. 1). Bradykinin degradation by the h-ACE C-domain and its mutants K1087A, Y1096F, and K1087A/Y1096F was estimated by determining the rate of substrate degradation (initial concentration of ≈125 μm), instead of product formation, using methods similar to those described for Sub P degradation; in these experiments, the fragmentation pattern was not quantified. Role of C-terminal Carboxylate-docking Interactions in the Hydrolysis of Sub P—The undecapeptide Sub P is amidated at its C terminus and, as a result, lacks negative charge at this position. This has been proposed to weaken or prevent docking of the substrate with ACE, via its carboxylate, and thus to allow alternative registration of this substrate with the extended substrate-binding site of the enzyme (11Skidgel R.A. Erdo ̈s E.G. Peptides (N.Y.). 2004; 25: 521-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Consistent with this proposal, we determined here that ACE not only degraded Sub P to release the C-terminal dipeptide (evident by the formation of Sub P-(1–7) and Sub P-(1–9)) (Fig. 1 and Table I), but also cleaved at the Phe8–Gly9 bond to form Sub P-(1–8) and to release the C-terminal tripeptide as well as effected endopeptidic cleavage of the Pro2–Lys3 bond to form the nonapeptide Sub P-(3–11). On the other hand, with Sub P free acid, ACE functioned solely as a carboxydipeptidase (Table I). This indicates that firm anchoring of substrate via a tight C-terminal carboxylate interaction provides a solitary mode of substrate registration and thus targeting of a single scissile bond.Table IMode of hydrolysis of Sub P, Sub P free acid (Sub P-COO–), and [Arg11]Sub P by the h-ACE C-domain and its K1087A, Y1096F, and K1087/Y1096F mutantsSubstrateProduct formationEnzymeSub P-(3-11)aFormation of Sub P-(3-11), Sub P-(1-8), and Sub P-(1-7) + Sub P-(1-9) represents endopeptidase, tripeptidyl carboxypeptidase, and dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase activities, respectively (Fig. 1).

Open table in a new tab We next studied the role of the carboxylate-docking interactions by mutating the h-ACE C-domain residues Tyr1096 and Lys1087 to Phe and Ala, respectively. Based on x-ray crystal structures of human testicular ACE-lisinopril and ACE-captopril complexes (8Natesh R. Schwager S.L. Sturrock E.D. Acharya K.R. Nature. 2003; 421: 551-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (697) Google Scholar, 12Natesh R. Schwager S.L. Evans H.R Sturrock E.D. Acharya K.R. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 8718-8724Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar), the Y1096F mutation, which deletes the side chain hydroxyl group of Tyr, is expected to eliminate its ability to interact with the substrate C-terminal carboxylate or amide groups as well as with the captopril and lisinopril C-terminal carboxylate groups. The K1087A mutation, which deletes the charged amino group (and shortens the side chain length) from the Lys side chain, is also expected to eliminate its ability to interact, directly and indirectly, with the substrate C-terminal carboxylate or amide group as well as with the captopril and lisinopril C-terminal carboxylate groups. Indeed, Fig. 2 shows that, as expected, the Y1096F mutation produced a decrease (≈20-fold) in captopril binding affinity (1/Ki), indicating, by experiment, its importance for captopril docking. The low activity of the K1087A C-domain made it difficult to accurately determine the binding affinity of captopril for this mutant; however, at a concentration of 40 mm, captopril inhibited K1087A C-domain activity by only ≈80% (data not shown). Table I shows that single or double site-specific mutations of the h-ACE C-domain carboxylate-docking residues Tyr1096 and Lys1087 to Phe and Ala, respectively, produced a decrease in dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase activity (e.g. 83 ± 0.57% in the wild-type h-ACE C-domain versus 36 ± 0.78% in Y1096F/K1087A (n = 3); p < 0.001) and an increase in substrate hydrolysis at other sites. With Y1096F/K1087A, endopeptidase (at the Pro2–Lys3 bond) and tripeptidyl carboxypeptidase activities were higher by 3- and 5.8-fold, respectively, than with the wild-type h-ACE C-domain. These findings suggest that hydrogen-bonding interactions between the C-terminal amide group of Sub P and Tyr1096 and Lys1087 of the h-ACE C-domain are a significant part of the substrate registration strategy. Sub P free acid hydrolysis was reduced by 1.8-, 34-, and 72-fold with mutants Y1096F, K1087A, and Y1096F/K1087A, respectively, compared with the wild-type h-ACE C-domain (Table I), indicating the functional importance of the C-terminal carboxylate-docking interaction. Remarkably, however, with respect to Sub P free acid hydrolysis, the dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase activity of the h-ACE C-domain remained the sole mode of substrate hydrolysis, even in the Y1096F/K1087A h-ACE C-domain (Table I). These findings indicate that interactions of a substrate C-terminal carboxylate other than the carboxylate-docking interaction with Tyr1096 and Lys1087 are important for substrate registration. The h-ACE C-domain-lisinopril co-crystal x-ray structure shows that the surface of the substrate-binding cleft, which contains the S′ subsites, 2The nomenclature used for the individual amino acids (P1, P1′, etc.) of a substrate and the subsites (S1, S1′, etc.) of the enzyme is that of Schechter and Berger (18Schechter I. Berger A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1967; 27: 157-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (4783) Google Scholar). Amino acid residues of substrates numbered P1, P2, etc., are toward the N-terminal direction, and P1′, P2′, etc., are toward the C-terminal direction from the scissile bond. is negatively charged (8Natesh R. Schwager S.L. Sturrock E.D. Acharya K.R. Nature. 2003; 421: 551-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (697) Google Scholar). It is tempting to speculate that the negatively charged C-terminal carboxylate group of the substrate generates unfavorable electrostatic interactions with most registration strategies other than that which, by virtue of interactions with Tyr1096 and Lys1087, stabilizes the substrate for the hydrolysis of a C-terminal dipeptide. Steric hindrance due to restricted S′ subsites appears to play little, if any, role in positioning the C-terminal substrate residue in a P2′ registration because endopeptidase activity is readily noted in a number of ACE substrates with a C-terminal amide group, as observed, for example, with Sub P (Table I). Given these considerations, we questioned whether, in addition to its well appreciated role in determining peptide bond cleavage efficiency, the interaction of the side chain of the C-terminal residue of the substrate with ACE could also be an important facet of substrate registration. We (9Liu X. Fernandez M. Wouters M.A. Heyberger S. Husain A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33518-33525Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) and others (13Shapiro R. Holmquist B. Riordan J.F. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 3850-3857Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) have previously shown that a P2′ Arg side chain in a substrate helps to stabilize the Michaelis h-ACE C-domain-substrate complex (i.e. the ground state). Here, we have shown that the h-ACE C-domain hydrolyzed [Arg11]Sub P exclusively via initial cleavage of a C-terminal dipeptide (Table I). In comparison, Sub P (which contains a C-terminal Met at position 11) underwent initial cleavage via the excision of C-terminal di-, tri-, or nonapeptides. These findings highlight the importance of both carboxylate-docking and C-terminal residue side chain interactions in determining substrate registration. Interestingly, positional effects have also been demonstrated in the neprilysin reaction (14Quay T. Slaughter C. Davis T.P. Merrill B.J. Hersh L.B. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 308: 133-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The finding that [Arg11]Sub P was hydrolyzed by the carboxylate docking-incompetent h-ACE C-domain mutant Y1096F/K1087A exclusively via initial cleavage of a C-terminal tripeptide (Table I) additionally suggests that ACE has a previously unappreciated S3′ subsite that has a preference for an Arg side chain over a Met side chain. For reasons discussed above, this site cannot be utilized if the substrate is able to dock productively via the C-terminal carboxylate interaction. Nevertheless, it is evident from our findings that it can be readily targeted with compromise of the carboxylate interaction. This and other potential interactions between substrate and S′ subsites are expected to be crucial in determining the site at which the endopeptidase activity of ACE becomes manifest when it interacts with peptide substrates containing an amidated C terminus. In addition, differences in preferences, not only in P1′ and P2′, but also in P3′–P′n, between the ACE C- and N-terminal domains may explain why the ACE N-terminal domain displays higher endopeptidase activity with the naturally amidated substrate luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone than does its C-domain. C-terminal Carboxylate-docking Interactions Are Critical in the Hydrolysis of Ang I but Not Bradykinin—The hydrolysis of Ang I by ACE differs from that of Sub P in some important respects. With Ang I, ACE is an obligate exopeptidase (dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase), as evidenced by the fact that cleavage is restricted to its Phe8–His9 bond to yield Ang II and the dipeptide His-Leu. Indeed, alternative substrate registration modes are not observed even when the C-terminal carboxylate group in Ang I is amidated. These findings indicate that interactions between the ACE extended substrate-binding site and Ang I are not cognate in any registration mode other than that which releases a C-terminal dipeptide. Moreover, the occurrence of a P1′ Pro in the product Ang II prevents its degradation by further C-terminal dipeptide cleavage. Here, we took advantage of these properties of the ACE–Ang I interaction, which are useful in determining the kinetics of the ACE carboxylate-docking interaction with respect to its dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase activity. As shown in Table II, with respect to Ang I hydrolysis, the Y1096F/K1087A mutation, which is expected to eliminate carboxylate-docking interactions, caused a >10,000-fold decreased kcat/Km (Table II), i.e. the carboxylate-docking interactions appear to stabilize the h-ACE C-domain-Ang I transition state by >5.7 kcal/mol (ΔΔG‡T).Table IIKinetic constants for the hydrolysis of the Phe8–Xaa9 bond in Ang I and its analogs [Phe9]Ang I, [Arg10]Ang I, and [Phe9,Arg10]Ang I by the wild-type h-ACE C-domain and its mutants Y1096F, K1087A, and Y1096F/K1087ASubstrateEnzymeKmkcatkcat/Kmμms-1s-1 μm-1Ang IWild-type52 ± 0.1852 ± 0.171.0 ± 0.004[Phe9]Ang IWild-type32 ± 1.4550 ± 6.217 ± 0.52[Arg10]Ang IWild-type44 ± 0.88460 ± 2.311 ± 0.22[Phe9,Arg10]Ang IWild-type11 ± 0.351400 ± 2.5120 ± 4Ang IY1096F——0.018 ± 0.00013[Phe9]Ang IY1096F56 ± 1.8110 ± 1.31.9 ± 0.04[Arg10]Ang IY1096F46 ± 1.057 ± 0.471.3 ± 0.02[Phe9,Arg10]Ang IY1096F14 ± 0.66220 ± 117 ± 0.69Ang IK1087A——<0.0001[Phe9]Ang IK1087A——0.026 ± 0.0006[Arg10]Ang IK1087A——0.057 ± 0.0004[Phe9,Arg10]Ang IK1087A25 ± 0.066.5 ± 0.030.26 ± 0.001Ang IY1096F/K1087A—"

When B-Myb functions as an activator, it has been found to regulate genes that promote entry into S phase (17Bessa M. Joaquin M. Tavner F. Saville M.K. Watson R.J. Blood Cells Mol. Dis. 2001; 27: 416-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 18Sala A. Watson R. J. Cell. Physiol. 1999; 179: 245-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Furthermore, its activity is greatly enhanced by phosphorylation by cyclin A-Cdk2 (19Bessa M. Saville M.K. Watson R.J.

Blood. 2001; 97: 2091-2097Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). We showed that B-Myb displays a strong negative regulatory activity on MBS element-driven reporter activity and on type I and type V collagen gene promoters in vascular SMCs in culture (3Marhamati D.J.

Matrix Biol. 1999; 18: 275-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Furthermore, B-Myb mediates the decrease in type I collagen gene transcription induced by basic fibroblast growth factor (21Kypreos K.E. Nugent M.A. Sonenshein G.E. Cell Growth Differ. 1998; 9: 723-730PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, B-Myb does not induce proliferation of bovine SMCs (22Marhamati D.J. Bellas R.E. Arsura M. Kypreos K.E. Sonenshein G.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2448-2457Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), and cyclin A dramatically reduces its ability to repress collagen gene expression (23Hofmann C.S. Sullivan C.P. Jiang H.Y.

Consistent with our observations, B-Myb inhibits c-Myb-mediated transactivation of the α2(I) collagen promoter in scleroderma fibroblasts (25Luchetti M.M. Paroncini P. Majlingova P. Frampton J.

Jimenez S.A. Sala A. Saitta B. Biochem. J. 2004; 378: 609-616Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). SMCs are the major cellular constituents of the medial layer of an artery and are responsible for the synthesis and deposition of connective tissue proteins, including elastin, that maintain vascular tone in the adult blood vessel (27Ross R. N. Engl. J. Med. 1999; 340: 115-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (19339) Google Scholar, 28Ross R. Klebanoff S.J. J. Cell Biol. 1971; 50: 159-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar, 29Kadar A. Gardner D.L. Bush V. J. Pathol. 1971; 104: 253-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Elastin is one of the major structural proteins of large arteries, contributing the physical properties of extensibility and elastic recoil. Elastin is synthesized as a soluble monomeric precursor called tropoelastin, which has an apparent molecular mass of 62–75 kDa, depending on animal species and isoform (30Foster J.A. Curtiss S.W. Am. J. Physiol. 1990; 259: L13-L23PubMed Google Scholar, 31Pollock J. Baule V.J. Rich C.B. Ginsburg C.D. Curtiss S.W. Foster J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 3697-3702Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Tropoelastin is subsequently secreted from the SMC and assembled into a highly stable, insoluble, polymeric structure in the extracellular matrix through covalent cross-links derived from lysine residues (32Tatham A.S. Shewry P.R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 567-571Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 33Debelle L. Tamburro A.M. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1999; 31: 261-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). Elastic fibers are arranged into concentric rings of elastic lamellae and SMCs. Elastic lamellae provide the resilience that enables arteries to absorb hemodynamic stress of cardiac systole and to release this energy in the form of sustained blood pressure during diastole. The number of lamellar units appears to be species-specific, fixed, and genetically predetermined (34Wolinsky H. Glagov S. Circ. Res. 1967; 20: 99-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar). During the development of the aorta, synthesis of elastin occurs very early, and its expression is regulated, in part, at the transcriptional level (35Perrin S. Foster J.A. Crit. Rev. Eukaryot. Gene Expr. 1997; 7: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Once the artery has been fully formed, SMCs differentiate into a contractile phenotype in which they normally remain (36Chamley-Campbell J. Campbell G.R. Ross R. Physiol. Rev. 1979; 59: 1-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (1266) Google Scholar). In culture, vascular SMCs exhibit a synthetic phenotype, and an inverse relationship exists between cell proliferative state and matrix deposition (36Chamley-Campbell J. Campbell G.R. Ross R. Physiol. Rev. 1979; 59: 1-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (1266) Google Scholar). In exponential growth, cultured SMCs synthesize low levels of matrix proteins, and expression of matrix genes is induced when SMCs reach confluence or are deprived of serum growth factors (37Beldekas J.C. Gerstenfeld L. Sonenshein G.E. Franzblau C. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 12252-12256Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 38Chang C.J. Sonenshein G.E.

Specifically, it has been shown that the expression of elastin varies inversely with the growth rate of SMCs (40Barone L.M. Wolfe B.L. Faris B. Franzblau C. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 3175-3182Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 41Toselli P. Faris B. Sassoon D. Jackson B.A. Franzblau C.

Confluent primary chick vascular SMCs displayed a dramatic increase in elastin mRNA levels upon serum deprivation, and when serum was added back to the cultures, cell proliferation was induced, and elastin mRNA levels dropped (43Wachi H. Seyama Y. Yamashita S. Tajima S. Biochem. J. 1995; 309: 575-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Similarly, it was shown that types I, III, and V/XI collagen mRNA levels were relatively low when SMCs were subconfluent and growing exponentially, and levels increased as cells become confluent (37Beldekas J.C. Gerstenfeld L. Sonenshein G.E. Franzblau C. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 12252-12256Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 43Wachi H. Seyama Y. Yamashita S. Tajima S. Biochem.

Chem. 1988; 263: 11426-11430Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 46Kindy M.S. Sonenshein G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 12865-12868Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, to explore the role of B-Myb on collagen gene expression in vascular SMCs in vivo, we studied the effects of overexpression of the human B-myb gene in a transgenic mouse model. We observed a reduction in type I and type V collagen expression in adult animals and a reduction in neointima formation upon vascular injury (23Hofmann C.S. Sullivan C.P. Jiang H.Y. Stone P.J. Toselli P. Reis E.D. Chereshnev I. Schreiber B.M. Sonenshein G.E. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2004; 24: 1608-1613Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Here, these transgenic mice are characterized with respect to elastin gene expression. A substantial reduction in tropoelastin mRNA expression is observed in aortas as well as isolated aortic SMCs from adult B-myb transgenic versus age-matched wild type (WT) animals, although measurements of insoluble elastin and numbers of elastic layers in the vessel wall revealed no differences between WT and transgenic animals. Importantly, elastin mRNA levels are not reduced in neonatal transgenic mice, apparently due to high cyclin A expression, which ablates B-Myb-mediated repression of the elastin promoter. Thus, these findings help to elucidate the mechanism of B-myb-mediated resistance to vascular injury that we reported recently (23Hofmann C.S. Sullivan C.P. Jiang H.Y. Stone P.J. Toselli P. Reis E.D. Chereshnev I. Schreiber B.M. Sonenshein G.E. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2004; 24: 1608-1613Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) and implicate cyclin A and B-Myb in developmental regulation of expression of elastin, a key structural component of the vessel wall. Isolation and Culture of SMCs—FVB mice overexpressing human B-myb (2300-bp human B-myb cDNA driven by the basal cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter) in the aorta were generated as described previously (23Hofmann C.S. Sullivan C.P. Jiang H.Y. Stone P.J. Toselli P. Reis E.D. Chereshnev I. Schreiber B.M. Sonenshein G.E. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2004; 24: 1608-1613Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Murine SMCs were prepared as described previously (23Hofmann C.S. Sullivan C.P. Jiang H.Y. Stone P.J. Toselli P. Reis E.D. Chereshnev I. Schreiber B.M. Sonenshein G.E. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2004; 24: 1608-1613Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Briefly, the aortas of 3-month-old female CMV-B-myb transgenic or WT FVB mice (Taconic Farms) were removed from the aortic arch to the femural bifurcation, minced, and subjected to digestion with 0.5 μg/ml bacterial collagenase (Sigma type I) and 0.125 μg/ml porcine pancreatic elastase (Sigma type III) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with nonessential amino acids, 1 mmol/liter sodium pyruvate, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen) (complete DMEM). SMCs were collected by centrifugation at 400 × g for 10 min at room temperature and grown in complete DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Second passage cultures were subjected to immunohistochemistry with an antibody against SMC α-actin, which demonstrated that contamination with endothelial cells and fibroblasts was negligible (data not shown). Bovine aortic SMCs, derived by explants from the aortic arches of female calves, were grown in complete DMEM plus 10% fetal bovine serum as we described previously (37Beldekas J.C. Gerstenfeld L. Sonenshein G.E. Franzblau C. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 12252-12256Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cell culture medium was changed every 2–3 days, and SMCs were used between passages 2 and 6. RNA Isolation—For extraction of total RNA from aortas, the region from the aortic arch to the diaphragm was removed from age-matched mice, and samples (100–200 mg) were frozen and homogenized in liquid nitrogen. RNA was prepared using the Ultraspec-II RNA Isolation System (Biotecx Laboratories, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Total RNA was isolated from cultured SMCs by guanidinium isothiocyanate extraction followed by purification on CsCl density gradients, as described (47.Sambrook, J., Fritsch, E. F., and Maniatis, T. (1987)Google Scholar). Northern Blot Analysis—For Northern blot analysis, RNA samples (12 μg for RNA from tissues and 20 μg for RNA from cultured SMCs) were denatured and separated by electrophoresis in 1.0% formaldehyde agarose gels (48Dean M. Kent R.B. Sonenshein G.E. Nature. 1983; 305: 443-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). RNA was stained with ethidium bromide to verify integrity and equal loading and then transferred to nylon membranes. Probes, prepared as described (21Kypreos K.E. Nugent M.A. Sonenshein G.E. Cell Growth Differ. 1998; 9: 723-730PubMed Google Scholar), included human B-myb (2300-bp cDNA), elastin (1.1-kb fragment of rat cDNA (49Rich C.B. Foster J.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1989; 268: 551-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar)), and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) (600-bp cDNA fragment). Quantitation by scanning densitometry was performed using KDS1D version 2.0 (Eastman Kodak Co.). RT-PCR—RNA was digested for 30 min at 37 °C with RQ1 RNase-free DNase (Promega) according to the manufacturer's directions. Reverse transcription (RT) was performed using 5 μg of RNA in the presence or absence of SUPERSCRIPT™ RNase H– reverse transcriptase and 200 ng of random primers. PCRs were performed using one-fortieth volume of the total RT reaction and Taq DNA polymerase according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). A primer pair for the cyclin A2 gene, located at bp 789 and 1334 within the mouse cDNA sequence (5′-GAGACCCTGCATTTGGCTGTG-3′ and 5′-GGTAGGTCTGGTGAAGGTCC-3′), yielding a fragment of 550 bp, was employed. To control for RNA integrity, the following primer pair was employed, which amplified a 600-bp RT-PCR product of GAPDH: 5′-TCACCATCTTCCAGGAG-3′ and 5′-GCTTCACCACCTTCTTG-3′. Annealing of the reaction was performed at 63 °C for cyclin A2 (28 cycles) and at 53 °C for GAPDH (20 cycles). Immunoblot Analysis—For preparation of protein extracts, tissues from age-matched B-myb transgenic and WT mice were frozen in liquid nitrogen and then homogenized in radioimmune precipitation buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS, 1% sodium sarcosyl, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 3 μg/ml aprotinin) using a Polytron homogenizer (Kinematica GmBH). Following incubation on ice for 30 min, the DNA was sheared either by sonication for 5–10 s or by passing the lysate 20 times through a 23-gauge and then a 25-gauge needle. The debris was removed by centrifugation at 13,000 rpm in an Eppendorf centrifuge for 30 min at 4 °C. Protein concentration was determined using the Bio-Rad Dc protein assay (Bio-Rad). Proteins were resolved in 10% polyacrylamide-SDS gels and subjected to immunoblotting, as we described previously (50Sovak M.A. Bellas R.E. Kim D.W. Zanieski G.J. Rogers A.E. Traish A.M. Sonenshein G.E. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 2952-2960Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar). A goat antibody against rat tropoelastin (RA75) was purchased from Elastin Products. The antibodies against human B-Myb (sc-724) and β-actin were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. and Sigma, respectively. The rabbit polyclonal cyclin A antibody (A5) was purchased from Lab Vision. RNA Isolation and Gene Microarray Analysis—Aortas were removed from C57BL/6 embryos at embryonic day 12, 14, 16, and 18, postnatal days 0 (representing the first 24 h of life), 4, 7, 10, 14, 21, 30, and 60, and 5.5 months of life. Total RNA was extracted from each sample of pooled aortas (10–14 aortas per time point) using a modified guanidinium/phenol extraction method. RNA quality and purity was evaluated with the use of an RNA 6000 Nano Labchip (Agilent, Palo Alto, CA) and Agilent 2100 bioanalyzer per the manufacturer's protocol (Agilent). cRNA target and gene chip hybridization were performed by the Multiplexed Gene Analysis Core Facility of the Siteman Cancer Institute at the Washington University in St. Louis School of Medicine. A duplicate of the P7 time point was taken and analyzed, which indicated that the variability was minimal. The MU74Av2 chips were scanned, and the intensities of the images were analyzed by the GeneChip Analysis Suite software (Affymetrix). All chip intensities were scaled by the software to an average of 1500 units. Probe sets were removed from the analysis if the difference between their maximum and minimum raw average difference values over the time series was less than 300. Details of the array procedures, sample selection and preparation, and data analysis can be found as described. 2S. E. McLean, B. H. Mecham, T. J. Mariani, S. Corry, C. H. Ciliberto, and R. P.

Transient Transfection Assays—Bovine adult aortic SMCs were plated at 60 × 104 cells/well in 6-well dishes and transfected the following day using Lipofectamine (2.4–3.2 μg of DNA total in 5 μl of Lipofectamine reagent) according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). The following vectors were employed: elastin 2.2-CAT and elastin 0.5-CAT, which contain 2.2 and 0.5 kb of the proximal region of the human elastin promoter linked to a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) reporter (kindly provided by J. Rosenbloom, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA) (51Rich C.B. Fontanilla M.R. Nugent M. Foster J.A. J. Biol.

Cells were harvested 72 h after transfection, and CAT activity was analyzed as described (21Kypreos K.E. Nugent M.A. Sonenshein G.E. Cell Growth Differ. 1998; 9: 723-730PubMed Google Scholar). Verhoeff and Van Gieson Staining—Age-matched 5-week-old to 2-month-old B-myb transgenic and WT mice were perfused with 5 ml of 1× phosphate-buffered saline followed by 10 ml of 4% paraformaldehyde, as described previously (23Hofmann C.S. Sullivan C.P. Jiang H.Y. Stone P.J. Toselli P. Reis E.D. Chereshnev I. Schreiber B.M. Sonenshein G.E. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2004; 24: 1608-1613Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The aortas were dissected out, fixed overnight in 4% paraformaldehyde, dehydrated, and embedded in paraffin. Five-μm cross-sections were prepared and subjected to Verhoeff and Van Gieson staining with the Accustain Elastic Stain kit (catalog no. HT25-A; Sigma) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Layers of elastic lamellae were analyzed by counting the stained sections of the aortas. Measurement of Total Insoluble Aortic Elastin Protein—To measure the levels of insoluble elastin, aortas from age-matched adult (3-monthold) B-myb transgenic and WT mice were dissected out, weighed, homogenized, and incubated in 0.1 n NaOH at 95 °C for 45 min to isolate insoluble elastin. The insoluble residue was subjected to acid hydrolysis and amino acid analysis (Beckman model 6300 with System Gold software) to determine the quantity of the elastin (52Lansing A.I. Rosenthal T.B. Alex M. Dempsey E.W. Anat. Rec. 1952; 114: 555-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar, 53Stone P.J. McMahon M.P. Morris S.M. Calore J.D. Franzblau C. In Vitro Cell Dev.

The amount of elastin was calculated as the sum of the amino acids (in nmol) multiplied by the average amino acid mass of 85 ng/nmol. Nonelastin protein in the aorta was measured by combining the supernatant from the 0.1 n NaOH incubation with an equal volume of 12 n HCl followed by hydrolysis and amino acid analysis, as described above. Protein was estimated by multiplying the sum of the amino acids (in nmol) by 100 ng/nmol. The mean value for the elastin content of the aortas normalized by total protein of the WT group of mice (n = 6) were compared with those for Line 2, 4, and 16 transgenic mice using the Bonferroni/Dunn procedure for the analysis of variance. Elastin mRNA Levels Are Reduced in the Aorta of Adult Transgenic B-myb Mice—Recently, we demonstrated that B-Myb represses type I collagen gene expression in the aorta and isolated aortic SMCs from adult transgenic mice expressing human B-myb (23Hofmann C.S. Sullivan C.P. Jiang H.Y. Stone P.J. Toselli P. Reis E.D. Chereshnev I. Schreiber B.M. Sonenshein G.E. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2004; 24: 1608-1613Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Thus, it was of interest to evaluate whether B-Myb affects the expression of elastin, another matrix gene important for the architecture of the vessel wall. In the previous report, the characterization of three B-myb transgenic mouse lines (Lines 2, 4, and 16) was described. It was demonstrated that the level of expression of B-Myb was greatest in Line 16, followed by Line 4, with the least amount of B-Myb in Line 2. RNA was isolated from pooled aortas of the three 6–10-week-old B-myb transgenic mouse lines as well as from age-matched WT mouse aortas. As in the previous report, Northern blot analysis was performed for elastin gene expression, and the data were normalized for the levels of GAPDH. Using the average of six independent experiments with age-matched animals, Lines 2, 4, and 16 displayed 40.6 ± 23.0%, 38.4 ± 12.6%, and 21.4 ± 17.1% of WT normalized elastin mRNA levels, respectively (Fig. 1A). These data indicate that there is a statistically significant decrease in elastin mRNA expression in aortas from all of the lines versus WT mice. The relationship between the levels of expression of B-Myb protein and elastin mRNA was determined, using previously reported values for the levels of B-Myb protein in the aortas of the three transgenic mouse lines (23Hofmann C.S. Sullivan C.P. Jiang H.Y. Stone P.J. Toselli P. Reis E.D. Chereshnev I. Schreiber B.M. Sonenshein G.E. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2004; 24: 1608-1613Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), specifically 1.6-, 2.5-, and 3.2-fold overexpression of B-Myb, respectively (Fig. 1B). These data suggest that elastin is another matrix gene target of repression by B-Myb in the aorta. Soluble Elastin Levels Are Reduced in the Aorta of Adult Transgenic Mice—To evaluate the effects of B-Myb on intracellular tropoelastin levels, the two transgenic lines that expressed the highest levels of B-Myb were selected for study. Total soluble protein extracts were prepared from individual aortas from WT and transgenic Line 16 and 4 mice and subjected to immunoblot analysis for soluble tropoelastin protein, as well as for β-actin, as control to normalize for differences in loading (Fig. 2, A and B, respectively). Tropoelastin was substantially reduced in three of three aortas from transgenic Line 16 tested as compared with the fo"
https://openalex.org/W2052395012,"Integrin activation has been postulated to occur in part via conformational changes in the I domain of the β subunit (the βI domain), especially near the F-α7 loop, in response to “inside-out” signaling. However, direct evidence for a role of the F-α7 loop in ligand binding and activity modulation is still lacking. Here, we report our finding that the F-α7 loop (residues 344–358) within the β2I domain has dual functions in ligand binding by αMβ2. On the one hand, it supports intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) binding to αMβ2 directly as part of a recognition interface formed by five noncontiguous segments (Pro192–Glu197, Asn213–Glu220, Leu225–Leu230, Ser324–Thr329, and Glu344–Asp348) on the apex of the β2I domain. On the other hand, it controls the open and closed conformation of the αMβ2 receptor, thereby indirectly affecting αMβ2 binding to other ligands. Switching the five constituent sequences of the ICAM-1-binding site within the β2I domain to their β1 counterparts destroyed ICAM-1 binding but had no effect on the gross conformations of the receptor. Of the five ICAM-1 binding-defective mutants, four had normal or even stronger interaction with Fg and C3bi, as reported in our previous study. Synthetic peptides derived from the identified site inhibited αMβ2-ICAM-1 interaction and supported direct binding to ICAM-1. Most importantly, perturbation of the F-α7 loop caused conformational changes within the β2I domain, which was further propagated to other regions of αMβ2. Altogether, our data demonstrate that inside-out signaling could modulate ligand binding directly by changing the ligand-binding pocket per se and/or indirectly by inducing multiple conformational changes within the receptor.

Of the five ICAM-1 binding-defective mutants, four had normal or even stronger interaction with Fg and C3bi, as reported in our previous study. Synthetic peptides derived from the identified site inhibited αMβ2-ICAM-1 interaction and supported direct binding to ICAM-1. Most importantly, perturbation of the F-α7 loop caused conformational changes within the β2I domain, which was further propagated to other regions of αMβ2. Altogether, our data demonstrate that inside-out signaling could modulate ligand binding directly by changing the ligand-binding pocket per se and/or indirectly by inducing multiple conformational changes within the receptor. Integrins are heterodimeric surface receptors that play essential roles in cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions (1Hynes R.O. Cell. 1987; 48: 549-550Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3111) Google Scholar, 2Plow E.F. Haas T.A. Zhang L. Loftus J.C. Smith J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21785-21788Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1117) Google Scholar). One of the most prominent features of the integrin receptor is its ability to change conformation in response to intracellular activation signals (“inside-out” signaling). Based on the crystal structures of free and ligand-bound αVβ3, several models have been proposed recently to explain the molecular mechanisms underlying receptor activation, including the “switchblade” model (3Takagi J. Petre B.M. Walz T. Springer T.A. Cell. 2002; 110: 599-611Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (935) Google Scholar), the “bell-rope” model (4Takagi J. Springer T.A. Immunol. Rev. 2002; 186: 141-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar), and the “deadbolt” model (5Xiong J.P. Stehle T. Goodman S.L. Arnaout M.A. Blood. 2003; 102: 1155-1159Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Despite the many differences, these models all predict that the F-α7 loop (corresponding to residues 344–358 of the β2I domain) is critical to the transition of the βI domain from closed to open conformation. In particular, the deadbolt model hypothesizes that residues within the F-α7 loop are in close contact with the residues in the extended CD loop of the βTD domain, such that the βTD domain acts as a deadbolt that freezes the movement of the F-α7 loop. Movement of the βTD domain as a result of the inside-out signaling will disrupt its interaction with the F-α7 loop and thus induce conformational changes within the βI domain and ultimately receptor activation (5Xiong J.P. Stehle T. Goodman S.L. Arnaout M.A. Blood. 2003; 102: 1155-1159Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Although very attractive, the validity of this model needs to be tested experimentally. The β2 integrin subfamily contains four distinct receptors (αLβ2, αMβ2, αXβ2, and αDβ2) with their expression restricted primarily to leukocytes. αLβ2 (LFA-1 or CD11a/CD18) recognizes counter receptors ICAM-1, 1The abbreviations used are: ICAM, intercellular adhesion molecule; DPBS, Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline; Fg, fibrinogen; FACS, fluorescence activated cell sorting; mAb, monoclonal antibody; NIF, neutrophil inhibitory factor; BSA, bovine serum albumin; HRP, horseradish peroxidase.

For example, αMβ2 interacts with fibrinogen (Fg) (8Altieri D.C. Bader R. Mannucci P.M. Edgington T.S. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 1893-1900Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar), C3bi (9Wright S.D. Rao P.E. Van Voorhis W.C. Craigmyle L.S. Iida K. Talle M.A. Westberg E.F. Goldstein G. Silverstein S.C.

Immunol. 1985; 134: 3307-3315PubMed Google Scholar). It is of interest, although ICAM-1 is recognized by αLβ2 and αMβ2, that different domains are involved. Among its five Ig-like domains (D1–D5), the first two (D1 and D2) interact with αLβ2 (13Staunton D.E. Dustin M.L. Erikson H.P. Springer T.A. Cell. 1990; 61: 243-254Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar), whereas the last three (D3, D4, and D5) bind αMβ2 (14Diamond M.S. Staunton D.E. Marlin S.D. Springer T.A. Cell. 1991; 65: 961-971Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar). Mutational studies suggested that αLβ2-ICAM-1 interaction is mainly mediated by the I domain within αL (15Randi A.M. Hogg N. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12395-12398Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Lu C. Shimaoka M. Ferzly M. Oxvig C. Takagi J. Springer T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 1998; 273: 28937-28944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). These mutagenic data have been confirmed by the recently published crystal structure of the αLI domain-D1D2 complex (18Shimaoka M. Xiao T. Liu J.H. Yang Y. Dong Y. Jun C.D. McCormack A. Zhang R. Joachimiak A. Takagi J. Wang J.H. Springer T.A. Cell. 2003; 112: 99-111Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). Less is known about the molecular mechanism underlying the αMβ2-ICAM-1 interaction. It was reported that both the αM and β2 subunits are involved (19Diamond M.S. Garcia-Aguilar J. Bickford J.K. Corbi ́ A.L. Springer T.A. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 1031-1043Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar, 20Goodman T.G. Bajt M.L. J. Biol.

Chem. 1995; 270: 94-98Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). However, the nature of the ICAM-1-binding site within either subunit is not well defined. Recently, using the homolog-scanning mutagenesis approach (22Cunningham B.C. Jhurani P. Ng P. Wells J.A. Science. 1989; 243: 1330-1336Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar), we have identified a region within the β2I domain (residues 125–385) that interacts directly with two αMβ2 ligands (Fg and C3bi) (23Xiong Y.M. Haas T.A. Zhang L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46639-46644Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Given that ICAM-1 behaves differently from C3bi in its interaction with αMβ2 (20Goodman T.G. Bajt M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23729-23736Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), whether this same region is also involved in ICAM-1 binding is still unknown. In this study, we screened 17 αMβ2 receptors that contain individual substitutions within the β2I domain for ICAM-1 binding. The results from this study demonstrate that ICAM-1 recognizes a novel region on top of the β2I domain, which is well separated from the binding sites for C3bi and Fg. Most importantly, the F-α7 loop is located within this identified ligand-binding site. Perturbation of the F-α7 loop could directly switch the conformation of the β2I domain as well as other critical regions within αMβ2 from closed to open state, thus providing the first experimental support for a role of the F-α7 loop of the βI domain in receptor activation. Altogether, our data suggest that inside-out signaling could activate the integrin receptor either directly, by changing the shape of the ligand-binding pocket, and/or indirectly, by affecting the global conformation of the heterodimeric receptor. Materials—Human kidney 293 cells and the expression vector pCIS2M were gifts from Dr. F. J. Castellino (Notre Dame, IN). The cDNAs of CD11b and CD18 were obtained from Dr. B. Karan-Tamir (Amgen, Thousand Oaks, CA). mAb 24 was provided by Dr. Nancy Hogg (Imperial Cancer Research Fund, London, UK); mAb CBRM1/5 was obtained from eBioscience (San Diego, CA); IB4, OKM1, and TS1/18 were obtained from the ATCC (Manassas, VA); MEM148 was obtained from Serotec (Raleigh, NC); mAb 6.7 was from Pharmingen (San Diego, CA); and mAb MEM-48 was obtained from Biodesign (Kennebunk, ME). The recombinant γ-module of Fg was provided by Dr. L. Medved (American Red Cross, Rockville, MD). All other reagents were the highest grade available from Sigma unless otherwise noted. Site-directed Mutagenesis and Establishment of Stable Cell Lines— The detailed procedures for homolog-scanning mutagenesis and establishment of stable cell lines expressing wild type and the 17 αMβ2 mutants in human kidney 293 cells have been published (24Xiong Y.M. Zhang L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19340-19349Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). To create constitutively active αMI domains, we changed residue Ile316 to Gly, which enables the αMI domain to exist in an open conformation with constitutive ligand binding activity (25Xiong J.P. Li R. Essafi M. Stehle T. Arnaout M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38762-38767Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), and alternatively, we changed both Phe297 and Ala304 to Cys (the resulting Cys297–Cys304 linkage is compatible with an open conformation of the αMI domain (26Shimaoka M. Lu C. Salas A. Xiao T. Takagi J. Springer T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 16737-16741Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar)), using mutagenic primers 5′-CGGGAGAAGGGCTTTGCGATCGAG-3′ and 5′-GATCACGTGTGCCAGGTGAATAACTTTGAGTGTCTGAAGACCATT-3′, respectively. Human 293 cells expressing αMβ2 mutants that contain the active αM subunits with either the wild type or different mutant β2 subunits were prepared as described previously. To obtain cell lines that express equivalent receptor numbers as wild type αMβ2, each mutant cell line was subcloned by cell sorting using the αM-specific mAb 2LPM19c. Up to 20 colonies were picked and analyzed for integrin expression by FACS analysis. Cells expressing levels of receptor similar to expressed wild type levels of αMβ2 were selected and subcloned. To exclude the possibility of subcloning artifacts, all of our studies have been repeated using the original pool for every mutant. Preparation of ICAM-1-Fc Fusion Protein—The cDNAs of human IgG1 and human ICAM-1 were inserted separately into the pCIS2M expression vector (27Zhang L. Castellino F.J. J. Protein Chem. 1989; 8: 471-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar), and the resultant ICAM-1-Fc fusion protein was then expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells by co-transfection with pRSVneo using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen). Stable cells were established by selection with 800 μg/ml G418. The ICAM-1-Fc fusion protein was purified from the conditioned media by affinity chromatography using protein G-Sepharose, and the purity of the purified protein was confirmed by a single band of 140 kDa on 10% SDS-PAGE under reduced conditions. FACS Analysis—A total of 106 cells expressing wild type or mutant αMβ2 in Hanks' balanced salt solution containing 1 mm Mg2+ and 1 mm Ca2+ were incubated with 1 μg of mAb for 30 min at 4 °C, except for mAb 24, which were carried out at 37 °C. A subtype-matched mouse IgG served as a control. After washing with phosphate-buffered saline, the cells were mixed with fluorescein isothiocyanate goat anti-mouse IgG(H+L) F(ab′)2 fragment (1:20 dilution) (Zymed Laboratory) and kept at 4 °C for another 30 min. The cells were then washed with phosphate-buffered saline and resuspended in 500 μl of DPBS. FACS analysis was performed using FACScan (Becton-Dickinson), counting 10,000 events. Mean fluorescence intensities were quantified using the FACScan program. Adhesion Assays—Adhesion of the αMβ2-expressing cells to ICAM-1 was conducted based on our published method (28Zhang L. Plow E.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18211-18216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), except that the cells were pretreated with an activating β2-specific mAb (MEM48) (29Lu C. Ferzly M. Takagi J. Springer T.A. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 5629-5637Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Briefly, a 24-well polystyrene plate was coated with ICAM-1-Fc (50 μg/ml) and then blocked with 400 μl of 0.05% polyvinylpyrrolidone in DPBS. A total of 2 × 106 cells in Hanks' balanced salt solution containing 1 mm Ca2+ and 1 mm Mg2+ in the presence or absence of 2 mg/ml synthetic peptides or 50 nm NIF (specific for the αM subunit) were added to each well and incubated at 37 °C for 20 min. Unbound cells were removed by three washes with DPBS, and adherent cells were quantified by cell-associated acid phosphatase as described previously (28Zhang L. Plow E.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18211-18216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Solid Phase Binding Assays—To test the interaction between the identified sequences of the β2I domain and ICAM-1, 96-well microtiter plates (Immulon 4BX; Dynex Technologies Inc., Chantilly, VA) were coated with different synthetic peptides at 2 mg/ml overnight at 4 °C and postcoated with 3% BSA for 2 h at room temperature. ICAM-1-Fc (50 μg/ml) in Tris-buffered saline (20 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm Ca2+, 1 mm Mg2+, pH 7.4) was added to the wells and incubated for 2–3 h at 22 °C. After washing with Tris-buffered saline, bound ICAM-1-Fc was detected using protein A conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (HRP), and the HRP substrate 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine (KPL, Gaithersburg, MD). Alternatively, the peptides were biotinylated via their N-terminal Cys using the EZ-link PEO-Maleimide activated biotin kit, or their N-terminal Lys using sulfosuccinimidyl 6-(biotinamido) hexanoate (Pierce), based on the product instructions. The plate was coated with ICAM-1-Fc (50 μg/ml) and post-coated with BSA. Biotinylated peptides were added and incubated with ICAM-1-Fc for 2 h at room temperature. The bound peptides were detected using avidin conjugated to HRP. To detect real time interactions between ICAM-1 and the β2I domain peptides, a BIAcore 3000 SPR-based biosensor (BIAcore AB, Uppsala, Sweden) was used, and the protocols recommended by the manufacturer were followed. Briefly, the ICAM-1-Fc was covalently coupled to the CM5 sensor chips via primary amino groups, which was preactivated with N-ethyl-N′-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide hydrochloride/N-hydroxysuccinimide. This protocol resulted in ∼1000 resonance units of immobilized ICAM-1. A blank flow cell that had been N-ethyl-N′-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide hydrochloride/N-hydroxysuccinimide-activated and ethanolamine-blocked was used as a reference surface. Binding data were obtained by injecting various concentrations of the peptides over the ICAM-1-Fc surface at a flow rate of 5 μl/min. The experiments were conducted in a Tris buffer (20 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4) containing 1 mm MnCl2. The chip surface was regenerated with 0.1 m HCl. All of the data were analyzed using the BIAevaluation 3.0 program, subtracting binding to the blank flow cell to account for any nonspecific binding. To analyze steady state peptide binding, the peak response levels were plotted against the peptide concentrations, which were then fit to a single-site model (Langmuir isotherm) to determine the dissociation constants (Kd). The specificity of peptide binding was further verified using the corresponding scrambled controls. Cell Adhesion to ICAM-1 by αMβ2 Is Activation-dependent— Ligand binding by the β2 integrins depends on receptor activation (2Plow E.F. Haas T.A. Zhang L. Loftus J.C. Smith J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21785-21788Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1117) Google Scholar, 4Takagi J. Springer T.A. Immunol. Rev. 2002; 186: 141-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar), especially for ICAM-1 binding by αMβ2, which is of low affinity (10Diamond M.S. Staunton D.E. de Fougerolles A.R. Stacker S.A. Garcia-Aguilar J. Hibbs M.L. Springer T.A. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 3129-3139Crossref PubMed Scopus (778) Google Scholar). Indeed, when expressed on 293 cells, αMβ2 interacted with C3bi constitutively in the absence of receptor activation (28Zhang L. Plow E.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18211-18216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 29Lu C. Ferzly M. Takagi J. Springer T.A. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 5629-5637Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar), whereas it failed to do so with ICAM-1, unless activated by the β2-specific activating mAb MEM48 (Fig. 1), which recognizes the mid-region of β2 (29Lu C. Ferzly M. Takagi J. Springer T.A. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 5629-5637Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Addition of 10 μg/ml of mAb MEM48 enhanced cell adhesion by 4–8-fold, which could be blocked completely by the addition of an αM-specific antagonist (NIF) or EDTA, confirming the specificity and cation dependence of the adhesion assay. Moreover, mock transfected cells did not exhibit significant adhesion to ICAM-1. These results demonstrated the feasibility of using mAb MEM48 as an activator of αMβ2 for ICAM-1 binding. Therefore, all of the subsequent cell adhesion assays to ICAM-1 were conducted in the presence of MEM48. A Unique Region on the Apex of the β2I Domain Is Critical to ICAM-1 Recognition by αMβ2—Previously, we have systematically substituted 17 segments that reside on the hydrated surface of the β2I domain with their counterpart sequences of the β1I domain and established stable cell lines for these 17 homolog-scanning αMβ2 mutants in 293 cells. We demonstrated that all 17 β2I domain mutants, when transfected together with wild type αM, were expressed at wild type levels on the cell surface. In addition, we have shown that these 17 β2I domain mutants possessed a normal intact conformation, based on a number of different criteria, including surface labeling and immunoprecipitation, as well as reactivity toward a panel of conformation-dependant antibodies (24Xiong Y.M. Zhang L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19340-19349Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Most importantly, we have studied these mutants using two conformation- and cation-dependent mAbs and showed that all 17 mutants exhibited similar cation-dependent conformations (23Xiong Y.M. Haas T.A. Zhang L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46639-46644Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 24Xiong Y.M. Zhang L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19340-19349Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Thus, loss of function by these homolog-scanning mutants is most likely attributed to perturbations of the ligand-binding site by these mutations. Goodman and Bajt (20Goodman T.G. Bajt M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23729-23736Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) reported that a mutation within the β2I domain had differential effects on ICAM-1 versus C3bi binding to αMβ2, suggesting that the β2I domain may possess different binding sites for ICAM-1 and C3bi. To locate critical sequences within the β2I domain for ICAM-1 binding, we conducted cell adhesion assays on all 17 αMβ2 mutants using ICAM-1 as the substrate, based on the conditions established in Fig. 1. The cell adhesion results are presented in Fig. 2. Most of the mutants supported cell adhesion to ICAM-1 and exhibited similar adhesive activities to the wild type receptor (less than 1.4-fold difference from wild type receptor). These functional mutants include αMβ2 (Arg144–Lys148), αMβ2(Lue154–Glu159), αMβ2(Asn181–Asp185), αMβ2(Gln199–Ala203), αMβ2(Pro247–Glu249), αMβ2(Ala262–Asp265), αMβ2(Asp290–Glu298), αMβ2(Gly305–His309), αMβ2(Thr334–Ile336), αMβ2(His354–Asn358), and αMβ2 (His371–Lys379). Mutant αMβ2(Pro192-Glu197) had a modest loss of cell adhesion (∼2.0-fold). Five mutants lost most of their ICAM-1 binding activity; compared with the wild type receptor, αMβ2(Glu162–Gly164), αMβ2(Asn213–Glu220), αMβ2(Leu225–Leu230), αMβ2(Ser324–Thr329), and αMβ2(Glu344–Asp348) had 8.5-, 6.2-, 10.7-, 5.5-, and 8.7-fold reduction in cell adhesion, respectively. The specificity of ligand binding to each of the mutants that retained activity was verified by blocking experiments using the αM-specific ligand NIF. These data suggest that six noncontiguous segments (Glu162–Gly164, Pro192–Glu197, Asn213–Glu220, Leu225–Leu230, Ser324–Thr329, and Glu344–Asp348) within the β2I domain contributed significantly to ICAM-1 binding by αMβ2. Fig. 3 shows the location of these critical residues within the β2I domain, which was constructed earlier (23Xiong Y.M. Haas T.A. Zhang L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46639-46644Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) based on its homology to β3 (30Xiong J.P. Stehle T. Zhang R. Joachimiak A. Frech M. Goodman S.L. Arnaout M.A. Science. 2002; 296: 151-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (1402) Google Scholar). Of the identified six sequences, segments Pro192–Glu197, Asn213–Glu220, Leu225–Leu230, Ser324–Thr329, and Glu344–Asp348 reside proximally in space and form a common ligand-binding site that is distinct from the C3bi-binding site we reported earlier (23Xiong Y.M. Haas T.A. Zhang L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46639-46644Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Therefore, we concluded that these five segments likely contributed directly to ICAM-1 binding. Segment Glu162–Gly164 resided at the bottom of the β2I domain that is far away from the identified ligand-binding site and thus less likely to contribute directly to ICAM-1 binding by αMβ2.Fig. 3Ligand-binding sites within the β2I domain. The structure of the β2I domain is modeled according to the crystal coordinates of integrin αVβ3 (Protein Data Bank code 1L5G) (30Xiong J.P. Stehle T. Zhang R. Joachimiak A. Frech M. Goodman S.L. Arnaout M.A. Science. 2002; 296: 151-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (1402) Google Scholar). Molecular modeling was carried out using InsightII modules: Biopolymer, Homology, and Discover (Accelrys Inc.) (23Xiong Y.M. Haas T.A. Zhang L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46639-46644Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The backbone of the β2I domain is shown with the β-sheets in light blue and α-helices in red, with the bound Ca2+ cations as gray spheres. The Connolly surface of the ligand recognition sites generated using a probe size of 1.4 Å are highlighted in blue (residues 192–197), green (residues 213–220), dark orange (residues 225–230), pale green (residues 324–329), and dark green (residues 344–348). The F-α7 loop is located within residues 344–358 and contains part of the ligand-binding site (residues 344–348 shown in dark green). This figure was prepared using the program MOLMOL (41Koradi R. Billeter M. Wuthrich K. J. Mol. Graph. 1996; 14: 29-32Crossref Scopus (6489) Google Scholar).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) A major ligand-binding site is located within the αMI domain, which exists in an equilibrium between the open and closed conformations (31Li R. Rieu P. Griffith D.L. Scott D. Arnaout M.A. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1523-1534Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 32McCleverty C.J. Liddington R.C. Biochem. J. 2003; 372: 121-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Because activation of the αI domain depends critically on the βI domain (33Alonso J.L. Essafi M. Xiong J.P. Stehle T. Arnaout M.A. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: R340-R342Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), it is possible that mutations of the β2I domain interfered with the activation of the αMI domain, leading to defective ligand binding. To exclude this possibility, we created constitutively active αMI domains by replacing the critical Ile316 within helix 7 of the αMI domain to Gly, based on the study of Xiong et al. (25Xiong J.P.

Lu C. Salas A. Xiao T. Takagi J. Springer T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 16737-16741Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The αM(I316G)I domain was shown to exist in an open conformation, and their corresponding αMβ2 receptors interact with ligands constitutively (25Xiong J.P. Li R. Essafi M. Stehle T. Arnaout M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38762-38767Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Thus, two different sets of αMβ2 mutants, that of αM(I316G)β2 and αM(I316G)β2(Leu225–Leu230) and that of αM(Cys297–Cys304)β2 and αM(Cys297–Cys304)β2(Leu225–Leu230), were prepared, all of which contain the αMI domains with an open conformation. In addition, based on the report that the αMI domain adopts an open conformation in the presence of Mn2+ (31Li R. Rieu P. Griffith D.L. Scott D. Arnaout M.A. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1523-1534Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), we also conducted ligand binding assays in the presence of Mn2+. Thus, should the β2I domain function solely to control the conformations of the αMI domain, mutations within the β2I domain would have no effect on ligand binding by the active αM(I316G)β2 and αM(Cys297–Cys304)β2 receptors. On the other hand, if the β2I domain provides a direct ligand-binding site, mutations in β2 should abolish ligand binding even by the constitutively active αMβ2. As shown in Fig. 2 (B and D), cells expressing the αM(I316G)β2 receptor or the αM(Cys297–Cys304)β2 receptor both adhered constitutively to ICAM-1 (∼7.4- and ∼7.7-fold higher than that of wild type, respectively) in the absence of Mn2+, whereas wild type αMβ2-expressing or mock transfected cells did not show significant adhesion, confirming that both αM(I316G)β2 and αM(Cys297–Cys304)β2 are constitutively active for ICAM-1 binding. As expected, when activated by Mn2+, the wild type receptor supported strong cell adhesion to ICAM-1 (Fig. 2C). Of interest, the αM(Cys297–Cys304)β2 receptor exhibited differential binding activities, where it supported constitutive adhesion to ICAM-1 (Fig. 2D) but not to C3bi (26Shimaoka M. Lu C. Salas A.
