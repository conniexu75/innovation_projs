https://openalex.org/W2610186267,"Using pathway-specific optogenetic inhibition, the authors demonstrate that projections from the mediodorsal thalamus to prefrontal cortex support the maintenance of working memory, while prefrontal–thalamic projections support subsequent choice selection. Thalamo–prefrontal projections have a circuit-specific role in sustaining prefrontal delay-period activity, a neuronal signature required for successful task performance. The mediodorsal thalamus (MD) shares reciprocal connectivity with the prefrontal cortex (PFC), and decreased MD–PFC connectivity is observed in schizophrenia patients. Patients also display cognitive deficits including impairments in working memory, but a mechanistic link between thalamo–prefrontal circuit function and working memory is missing. Using pathway-specific inhibition, we found directional interactions between mouse MD and medial PFC (mPFC), with MD-to-mPFC supporting working memory maintenance and mPFC-to-MD supporting subsequent choice. We further identify mPFC neurons that display elevated spiking during the delay, a feature that was absent on error trials and required MD inputs for sustained maintenance. Strikingly, delay-tuned neurons had minimal overlap with spatially tuned neurons, and each mPFC population exhibited mutually exclusive dependence on MD and hippocampal inputs. These findings indicate a role for MD in sustaining prefrontal activity during working memory maintenance. Consistent with this idea, we found that enhancing MD excitability was sufficient to enhance task performance."

Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) are unique in their capacity to self-renew and replenish the entire blood system upon transplantation in a serial manner (Seita and Weissman, 2010Seita J.

HSCs give rise to a pool of multipotent progenitors (MPPs), which generate lineage-restricted progenitors, and finally, mature effector cells (Graf and Enver, 2009Graf T. Enver T. Forcing cells to change lineages.Nature. 2009; 462: 587-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar). We and others have recently identified a sub-population of HSCs by long-term label-retaining cell (LRC) assays, which are characterized by an extremely low in vivo proliferation history with only approximately five cell divisions per lifetime in a healthy mouse as shown by mathematical modeling (van der Wath et al., 2009van der Wath R.C.

These so-called dormant HSCs (dHSCs), (Lineage−, Sca-1+, c-Kit+, [LSK], CD150+, CD48−, CD135−, CD34−, LRC+), represent only ∼20%–30% of all HSCs (∼700 cells out of 100 million hematopoietic cells in the murine bone marrow) but harbor the highest long-term reconstitution potential (summarized in Figure 1A) (Bernitz et al., 2016Bernitz J.M.

Laurenti E. Oser G. van der Wath R.C. Blanco-Bose W. Jaworski M. Offner S. Dunant C.F. Eshkind L.

To date, the molecular fingerprint of HSC dormancy at the population and single-cell level, as well as the mechanism controlling their reversible cycle between dormant and active states during homeostasis and stress, remains largely unresolved. We have recently reported that retinoic acid (RA) metabolism is molecularly enriched in HSCs compared to downstream multipotent progenitor populations (Cabezas-Wallscheid et al., 2014Cabezas-Wallscheid N. Klimmeck D. Hansson J. Lipka D.B. Reyes A. Wang Q. Weichenhan D. Lier A. von Paleske L.

RA signaling has been shown to affect embryonic hematopoiesis and leukemogenesis (Chanda et al., 2013Chanda B. Ditadi A. Iscove N.N. Keller G.

However, its role in hematopoietic stem/progenitor biology remains controversial (Chute et al., 2006Chute J.P. Muramoto G.G. Whitesides J. Colvin M. Safi R. Chao N.J. McDonnell D.P.

RA is produced by two sequential oxidation steps from dietary vitamin A (Tang and Gudas, 2011Tang X.H. Gudas L.J. Retinoids, retinoic acid receptors, and cancer.Annu. Rev. Pathol. 2011; 6: 345-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). Vitamin A is an essential nutrient required for the normal function of the visual system, growth and development, and maintenance of epithelial cellular integrity, immune function, and reproduction (Brown and Noelle, 2015Brown C.C.

Lack of vitamin A is common in pre-school children, associated with night blindness as well as in skin and immune system deficiencies (Brown and Noelle, 2015Brown C.C. Noelle R.J.

Although the consequences of a vitamin A-free diet have been extensively studied in the context of the immune system (Brown and Noelle, 2015Brown C.C. Noelle R.J.

Iwata M. von Andrian U.H. Vitamin effects on the immune system: vitamins A and D take centre stage.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2008; 8: 685-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (1102) Google Scholar), the specific relevance of vitamin A for the maintenance and function of HSCs is unresolved. To establish a global molecular dormancy signature, we performed whole-transcriptome (RNA sequencing [RNA-seq]) analysis of dHSCs (LRCs), aHSCs (non-LRCs), and multipotent progenitors 1 (MPP1; Figures 1A–1C, S1A, and S1B). Briefly, we used fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS)-sorted dHSCs, aHSCs, and MPP1 from SCL-tTA;H2B-GFP mice (hereafter termed SCL) chased for 150 days with doxycycline (DOX) (Figure S1A) (Wilson et al., 2008Wilson A. Laurenti E. Oser G. van der Wath R.C. Blanco-Bose W. Jaworski M. Offner S. Dunant C.F. Eshkind L.

Klimmeck D. Hansson J. Lipka D.B. Reyes A. Wang Q. Weichenhan D. Lier A. von Paleske L.

Transcriptome-wide profiling and posttranscriptional analysis of hematopoietic stem/progenitor cell differentiation toward myeloid commitment.Stem Cell Reports. 2014; 3: 858-875Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). We identified a set of 27,236 expressed genes including protein-coding genes, pseudogenes, and long non-coding RNAs (Figure S1C; Table S1). Principle component analysis (PCA) showed a closer relationship between dHSCs and aHSCs compared to either one to MPP1 (Figure S1D). Consistently, we observed a large number of differentially expressed genes between MPP1 and either of the two HSC populations (false discovery rate [FDR] <0.1; Figure 1D). These results indicate that the transcriptomes of dHSCs and aHSCs are more similar to each other than to MPP1. Consistent with our previous reports, Cyld expression was higher and Cd34 levels were lower in dHSCs, as confirmed by qPCR (Figures 1E and S1E) (Tesio et al., 2015Tesio M. Tang Y. Müdder K. Saini M. von Paleske L. Macintyre E. Pasparakis M. Waisman A. Trumpp A. Hematopoietic stem cell quiescence and function are controlled by the CYLD-TRAF2-p38MAPK pathway.J. Exp.

Other reported HSC markers, such as Sca-1 and Epcr/Procr, or the recently described MolO stem cell signature (Figures 1E and S1F) (Wilson et al., 2015Wilson N.K. Kent D.G. Buettner F. Shehata M. Macaulay I.C. Calero-Nieto F.J. Sánchez Castillo M. Oedekoven C.A. Diamanti E. Schulte R. et al.Combined single-cell functional and gene expression analysis resolves heterogeneity within stem cell populations.Cell Stem Cell. 2015; 16: 712-724Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar) were also higher expressed in dHSCs compared to aHSCs and MPP1. Moreover, the long non-coding RNA Meg3 was expressed specifically in dHSCs, while Pf4 and Myc become upregulated in aHSCs and MPP1 (Figures 1E and S1E). Next, we investigated biological pathways differentially represented between dHSCs, aHSCs, and MPP1 using a competitive pathway enrichment analysis (Figures 1F, 1G, and S1G; FDR <0.1). dHSCs were molecularly enriched in immune-related processes such as chemokine signaling pathway, consistent with a likely immune protection of dHSCs against pathogens (Figure 1F). Peptide GPCRs and prostaglandin synthesis and regulation were also enriched in dHSCs (Figure 1F). By contrast, we found a robust downregulation of essential biosynthetic processes such as mRNA processing, eukaryotic transcription initiation, and translation factors in dHSCs compared to aHSCs and MPP1 (Figure 1G). This was associated with the downregulation of Myc target genes in dHSCs (FDR <0.1; Figure S1G). These results suggest that reduced biosynthetic activity and a specific immune protection program distinguish dHSCs from the quiescent aHSCs. Next, we applied single-cell (SiC) RNA-seq to 384 dHSCs and HSCs (HSCs = dHSCs plus aHSCs). We FACS-purified dHSCs or HSCs from SCL mice chased for 150 days with DOX in six independent experiments (Figures 2A and S2A–S2C). Interestingly, when visualizing the set of 319 SiCs that passed quality controls using clustering methods such as a hierarchical clustering heatmap, two-dimensional t-SNE representations, and PCA, we found no evidence for distinct clusters (Figures S2D–S2F; STAR Methods). Thus, we hypothesized that the transition from dormant toward active HSCs follows gradual changes through a series of intermediate cellular states rather than by a binary switch on/off pattern. We then used a computational approach based on pseudo-time analysis (Haghverdi et al., 2016Haghverdi L. Büttner M. Wolf F.A. Buettner F. Theis F.J. Diffusion pseudotime robustly reconstructs lineage branching.Nat. Methods. 2016; 13: 845-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar) together with diffusion maps to establish an order of the cells (see the STAR Methods). This revealed dHSCs at the right end of the diffusion map and active HSCs at the left end of the map (Figure S2G) (Haghverdi et al., 2015Haghverdi L. Buettner F. Theis F.J. Diffusion maps for high-dimensional single-cell analysis of differentiation data.Bioinformatics. 2015; 31: 2989-2998Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). We next subdivided cells into four stages (1–4) based on their pseudo-time (Figure 2C). dHSCs were most strongly enriched in early stages 1 and 2, while the majority of HSCs occurred in late stages 3 and 4, in line with the notion that these represent predominantly aHSCs. We also observed similar topology and ordering when analyzing the unseparated HSC population only (excluding sorted dHSCs), strongly suggesting that the established organization captures the transition from dHSCs to aHSCs (Figure S2H).Figure S2Single-Cell RNA-Seq of dHSCs and Overall HSCs, Related to Figure 2Show full caption(A) Single-cell RNA-seq workflow.

We next quantified the activity of different pathways and assessed variation across the four stages (Figures 2D and S2I–S2M; FDR <0.1). This analysis revealed 19 differentially regulated processes, the majority of which (15/19) exhibited patterns of gradually increased activity from dHSC stage 1 toward aHSC stage 4 cells (Figures 2D and S2I–S2K). These included pathways associated with different cellular biosynthetic activities (such as mRNA processing and translation factors) (Figures 2D and S2I), but also processes such as cell cycle-related pathways (DNA replication, G1 to S cell-cycle control) (Figure S2J) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) nuclear factor κB (NF-kB) signaling (Figure S2K). Confirmatory, the recently described MolO stem cell signature (Wilson et al., 2015Wilson N.K. Kent D.G. Buettner F. Shehata M. Macaulay I.C. Calero-Nieto F.J. Sánchez Castillo M. Oedekoven C.A.

Finally, three pathways, such as type II interferon and inflammatory signaling, did not show a continuous increase or decrease suggesting that these processes might act similarly in dormant and aHSCs (Figure S2L). Together, these results indicate that the global transition from inactive dHSCs (stage 1) to aHSCs (stage 4) can be best described by a continuous stream-like progression of steadily increasing metabolic activity and preparation for cell-cycle entry without the apparent presence of accumulating cellular intermediates. To identify individual drivers of variability from dHSCs toward aHSCs, we performed a PCA analysis on all variable genes. We then used different maps to visualize both genes driving differences in PC-1 (e.g., Ly6a, Cdk6; Figure S2N; for PCA see Figure S2D) and, in addition, canonical marker genes (e.g., Myc; Table S2). While Egr1, Ifitm1, and Ly6a expression are steadily decreasing, Cdk4, Cdk6, and Myc expression are steadily increasing at the single-cell level during the transition toward aHSCs (Figures 2G and 2H). Because genes driving differences in PC-1 were mainly cell-cycle activators such as Cdk6 and Nap1l1 (Figure S2N), we bioinformatically assessed the cell-cycle signature and cell-cycle stage of each individual cell (Figures 2I–2K, S2O, and S2P) (Scialdone et al., 2015Scialdone A. Natarajan K.N. Saraiva L.R. Proserpio V. Teichmann S.A. Stegle O. Marioni J.C. Buettner F. Computational assignment of cell-cycle stage from single-cell transcriptome data.Methods. 2015; 85: 54-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Consistent with the notion that both dormant and active HSCs are quiescent, all cells were classified as G0/G1. Similarly, the distribution of the probability for being in the G0/G1 phase was comparable across stages of pseudo-time (Figure S2O). Next, to investigate evidence for subtle variations in cell-cycle stages between dHSCs and aHSCs, we applied PCA to a set of genes that are annotated to cell cycle finding higher expression of cell-cycle genes in stage 4 aHSCs (Figures 2J, 2K, and S2P). We investigated individual members of the cell-cycle pathway in greater detail using population RNA-seq data of dHSC, aHSC, and MPP1 (Figure S2Q; Table S1). In line with the global Cyclone approach (Figure 2I), most genes related to DNA replication (Cdc45, Mcm4) were similarly low in dHSCs and aHSCs. In contrast, p57 was higher in dHSCs compared to aHSCs and MPP1, while Cdk4 increased its expression in aHSC and MPP1. These observations show that while dHSCs and aHSCs are both quiescent (both G0/G1), aHSCs are cell-cycle primed and major regulators that are differentially expressed in dormant and active HS"
https://openalex.org/W2612505059,"Gamma band rhythms may synchronize distributed cell assemblies to facilitate information transfer within and across brain areas, yet their underlying mechanisms remain hotly debated. Most circuit models postulate that soma-targeting parvalbumin-positive GABAergic neurons are the essential inhibitory neuron subtype necessary for gamma rhythms. Using cell-type-specific optogenetic manipulations in behaving animals, we show that dendrite-targeting somatostatin (SOM) interneurons are critical for a visually induced, context-dependent gamma rhythm in visual cortex. A computational model independently predicts that context-dependent gamma rhythms depend critically on SOM interneurons. Further in vivo experiments show that SOM neurons are required for long-distance coherence across the visual cortex. Taken together, these data establish an alternative mechanism for synchronizing distributed networks in visual cortex. By operating through dendritic and not just somatic inhibition, SOM-mediated oscillations may expand the computational power of gamma rhythms for optimizing the synthesis and storage of visual perceptions."

They find that almost 3% of all adenines are methylated in early-diverging fungi, and they identify clusters of methylated adenines that are enriched at transcription start sites of active genes. N6-methyldeoxyadenine (6mA) is a noncanonical DNA base modification present at low levels in plant and animal genomes1,2,3,4, but its prevalence and association with genome function in other eukaryotic lineages remains poorly understood. Here we report that abundant 6mA is associated with transcriptionally active genes in early-diverging fungal lineages5. Using single-molecule long-read sequencing of 16 diverse fungal genomes, we observed that up to 2.8% of all adenines were methylated in early-diverging fungi, far exceeding levels observed in other eukaryotes and more derived fungi. 6mA occurred symmetrically at ApT dinucleotides and was concentrated in dense methylated adenine clusters surrounding the transcriptional start sites of expressed genes; its distribution was inversely correlated with that of 5-methylcytosine. Our results show a striking contrast in the genomic distributions of 6mA and 5-methylcytosine and reinforce a distinct role for 6mA as a gene-expression-associated epigenomic mark in eukaryotes."

Its rapid life cycle, small (440-Mb) genome, and advanced germplasm resources make birch an attractive model for forest biotechnology. We assembled and chromosomally anchored the nuclear genome of an inbred B. pendula individual. Gene duplicates from the paleohexaploid event were enriched for transcriptional regulation, whereas tandem duplicates were overrepresented by environmental responses. Population resequencing of 80 individuals showed effective population size crashes at major points of climatic upheaval. Selective sweeps were enriched among polyploid duplicates encoding key developmental and physiological triggering functions, suggesting that local adaptation has tuned the timing of and cross-talk between fundamental plant processes. Variation around the tightly-linked light response genes PHYC and FRS10 correlated with latitude and longitude and temperature, and with precipitation for PHYC .

However, the metabolic roles of these two receptors and the underlying mechanisms are incompletely understood. Here, we studied the effects of the dual FXR and TGR5 agonist INT-767 on hepatic bile acid synthesis and intestinal secretion of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) in wild-type, Fxr−/−, and Tgr5−/− mice.

Interestingly, INT-767 reduced expression of the genes in the classic bile acid synthesis pathway but induced those in the alternative pathway, which is consistent with decreased taurocholic acid and increased tauromuricholic acids in bile. Furthermore, FXR activation induced expression of FXR target genes, including fibroblast growth factor 15, and unexpectedly Tgr5 and prohormone convertase 1/3 gene expression in the ileum. We identified an FXR-responsive element on the Tgr5 gene promoter. Fxr−/− and Tgr5−/− mice exhibited reduced GLP-1 secretion, which was stimulated by INT-767 in the Tgr5−/− mice but not in the Fxr−/− mice.

Bile acid synthesis in the liver generates two primary bile acids, cholic acid (CA) and chenodeoxycholic (CDCA), in humans (3Chiang J.Y. Bile acids: regulation of synthesis.J. Lipid Res. 2009; 50: 1955-1966Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1096) Google Scholar). However, in mouse liver, CDCA is converted to α- and β-muricholic acids (α/β-MCAs) due to the expression of a unique Cyp2c70 enzyme in mouse but not in human liver (4Takahashi S. Fukami T. Masuo Y.

Cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase (CYP7A1) is the first and rate-limiting enzyme in the classic bile acid synthesis pathway, whereas sterol 12α-hydroxylase (CYP8B1) catalyzes CA synthesis. The alternative bile acid synthesis pathway is initiated by steroid 27-hydroxylase (CYP27A1), followed by oxysterol 7α-hydroxylase (CYP7B1) to produce mainly CDCA. The relative contributions of these two pathways to total bile acid synthesis determines bile acid composition and hydrophobicity of the bile acid pool. Bile acids are conjugated to glycine or taurine for secretion into gallbladder bile. In the ileum, bile acids are reabsorbed, and gut bacterial bile salt hydrolases de-conjugate bile acids, whereas 7α-dehydroxylase converts CA and CDCA to deoxycholic acid (DCA) and lithocholic acid (LCA), respectively (2Li T. Chiang J.Y. Bile acid signaling in metabolic disease and drug therapy.Pharmacol. Rev. 2014; 66: 948-983Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar). CA (EC50 = 586 μm) and CDCA (EC50 = 17 μm) are the endogenous ligands of FXR, whereas T-LCA (EC50 = 0.03 μm) and DCA (EC50 = 1.01 μm) are more effective in activating TGR5 (5Kawamata Y. Fujii R.

However, the role of INT767 in regulation of bile acid synthesis and the underlying mechanism in anti-diabetes and obesity remain unclear and require further study. In this study, INT-767, OCA, and INT-777 were orally administered to mice to study their effects on hepatic bile acid synthesis, glucose and lipid metabolism, and intestinal GLP-1 secretion in wild-type, Fxr−/−, and Tgr5−/− mice. The data suggest that the dual FXR and TGR5 agonist INT-767 was highly efficacious in activating intestinal FXR, inducing TGR5 gene expression, and stimulating cellular Ca2+ concentration and GLP-1 secretion to improve glucose and insulin tolerance and lipid metabolism. INT-767 treatment reduced body weight and improved hepatic bile acid, lipid, and glucose metabolism and increased insulin sensitivity in high fat diet-induced obese mice. INT-767 has great therapeutic potential for treating NAFLD, diabetes, and obesity. Oral gavage of 30 mg/kg FXR-selective agonist OCA, TGR5-selective agonist INT-777, and dual FXR and TGR5 agonist INT-767 to wild-type C57BL6J mice was carried out to study their effects on intestinal GLP-1 secretion and liver metabolism. Results show that the INT-767 significantly improved glucose tolerance, whereas OCA and INT-777 did not (Fig. 1A). INT-767 and INT-777 rapidly stimulated glucose-induced GLP-1 secretion peaking at 15 min post-administration, whereas the effect of OCA was weaker (Fig. 1B). INT-767 and INT-777, but not OCA, significantly increased AKT473 phosphorylation indicating increased hepatic insulin signaling (Fig. 1C). OCA and INT-767, but not INT-777, significantly reduced serum cholesterol and triglycerides in wild-type mice (Fig. 1D). OCA and INT-767, but not INT-777, significantly reduced total bile acid pool size (intestine, liver, and gallbladder) by reducing intestinal bile acid contents (Fig. 1E). Among the three agonists tested, INT-767 is most effective in stimulating GLP-1 secretion, improving serum lipid profile, and stimulating glucose and insulin sensitivity. Although OCA increased serum GLP-1 and reduced serum lipids, it did not significantly increase glucose tolerance or hepatic insulin signaling. OCA is known to inhibit bile acid synthesis and decrease the bile acid pool (28Xu Y. Li F. Zalzala M. Xu J. Gonzalez F.J. Adorini L. Lee Y.K. Yin L. Zhang Y.

Fig. 2A shows that OCA and INT-767, but not INT-777, significantly reduced liver mRNAs encoding Cyp7a1 in the classic bile acid synthesis pathway. All three agonists reduced mRNA for Cyp8b1 involved in cholic acid synthesis. Interestingly, only INT-767 significantly increased mRNA for Cyp7b1 in the alternative bile acid synthesis pathway and for mitochondrial Cyp27a1, which initiates the alternative pathway. OCA and INT-767 increased mRNA levels of Shp and the canalicular bile salt expert pump (Bsep) indicating activation of FXR signaling in hepatocytes (Fig. 2A). Immunoblotting analysis shows that INT-767, but not INT-777, significantly reduced CYP7A1 and CYP8B1 protein expression but increased CYP7B1 and CYP27A1 protein expression (Fig. 2B), consistent with their effects on mRNA expression levels (Fig. 2A). INT-767 and OCA, but not INT-777, reduced steroid-response element-binding protein-1c (Srebp1c) and fatty-acid synthase (Fasn), but not diacylglycerol acetyltransferase (Dgat) involved in lipogenesis, and induced carboxylesterase-1 (Ces-1) involved in triglyceride hydrolysis (Fig. 2C). OCA significantly induced mRNA for hepatic apolipoprotein CII (ApoCII), an activator of lipoprotein lipase and peroxisomal proliferator-activated receptor γ-coactivator-1α (Pgc1α) in energy metabolism, but reduced ApoCIII, an inhibitor of lipoprotein lipase. INT767 strongly induced ApoCII mRNA expression. These agonists also reduced mRNA expression of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (Pepck) and glucose-6-phosphatase (G6pase) involved in gluconeogenesis (Fig. 2D). Overall, these results indicate that INT-767 is more effective than OCA in regulation of bile acid synthesis by inhibiting the classic pathway and stimulating the alternative pathway for bile acid synthesis to improve hepatic lipid and glucose metabolism via activation of hepatic FXR signaling and inhibition of lipogenesis and increasing lipoprotein metabolism. Effects of OCA and INT-777, but not INT-767, on bile acid composition have been reported (22Donepudi A.C. Boehme S. Li F. Chiang J.Y.

Analysis of gallbladder bile acid composition, which represents newly synthesized bile acids and bile acid recirculation to the liver from intestine, shows that INT-767 decreased TCA and CA, increased T-β-MCA and T-ω-MCA, but had no effect on T-LCA and LCA contents in gallbladder bile (Fig. 3A). T-β-MCA is a primary bile acid synthesized in mouse liver, and T-ω-MCA is a secondary bile acid produced by the gut microbiota. INT-767 reduced unconjugated bile acids and increased tauro-conjugated bile acids in gallbladder bile. Increasing T-MCA and decreasing of TCA by INT-767 reduced hydrophobicity of bile (Fig. 3B). Effect of INT-767 on bile acid composition is consistent with changes of bile acid synthesis gene expression (Fig. 2, A and B) and indicates switching of bile acid synthesis from the classic to the alternative pathway. Fig. 4A shows that OCA and INT-767 significantly induced FXR target gene mRNA levels in the ileum, including Shp, Fgf15, organic solute transporter 1α (Ostα), and Ostβ mRNA levels, whereas the apical sodium-dependent bile acid transporter (Asbt) mRNA expression was not affected. Surprisingly, OCA and INT-767 strongly induced Tgr5 mRNA expression. Interestingly, these FXR agonists also induced prohormone convertase 1/3 (PC1/3), which processes pre-proglucagon to GLP-1 in L cells. These data provide the first evidence that FXR might induce intestinal Tgr5 and Pc1/3 gene expression to stimulate GLP-1 processing and secretion. However, these FXR agonists did not affect pro-glucagon (Gcg) mRNA expression in mouse ileum, in contrast to a previous report that the FXR-selective agonist GW4064 inhibited Gcg expression (29Trabelsi M.S. Daoudi M. Prawitt J. Ducastel S. Touche V. Sayin S.I. Perino A. Brighton C.A. Sebti Y. Kluza J. Briand O. Dehondt H. Vallez E. Dorchies E. Baud G. et al.Farnesoid X receptor inhibits glucagon-like peptide-1 production by enteroendocrine L cells.Nat. Commun. 2015; 6: 7629Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Consistently, intestinal Fgf15, Shp, Ostα, Tgr5, and Pc1/3 mRNA levels were all reduced in the ileum of Fxr−/− mice compared with wild-type mice (Fig. 4B). Immunoblotting analysis showed that TGR5 protein levels were induced in the ileum of OCA or INT767-treated wild-type mice but were reduced in Fxr−/− mice and absent in the intestine of Tgr5−/− mice (Fig. 4C). OCA and INT767 significantly increased PC1/3 protein expression in Glutag cells (Fig. 4D). Overall, these results suggest that activation of FXR induced Pc1/3 and Tgr5 mRNA and protein expression to increase processing of pre-proglucagon to GLP-1 for secretion. To study the mechanism of FXR induction of TGR5 expression, an inverted repeat with one-nucleotide spacing (IR1) was identified on the proximal promoter of the human TGR5 gene, which is highly conserved in the mouse Tgr5 gene (lower panel, Fig. 5A). To test whether this putative FXRE is functional, a human TGR5 promoter (nt −500 to −298)/luciferase reporter was constructed for use in transient transfection assays in STC-1 cells. INT-767 significantly stimulated human TGR5 promoter/luciferase reporter activity (Fig. 5B). Mutation of the IR1 sequence decreased basal reporter activity, which was not stimulated by OCA or INT-767. These data suggest that this FXRE in the human TGR5 promoter is functional and responsive to stimulation by INT-767. An electrophoretic mobility shift assay revealed that in vitro transcribed and translated FXR and FXR/RXRα heterodimer retarded the mobility of a labeled TGR5 probe containing the FXRE or the SHP probe used as a positive control (Fig. 5C). Addition of unlabeled TGR5 probe (cold) or mutant TGR5 probe abolished the band shift. These results indicate that the IR1 site on the human and mouse Tgr5 promoter binds FXR/RXRα. Furthermore, nuclei were isolated from ileum of mice treated with OCA or INT-767 for chromatin immunoprecipitation assay (ChIP). The ChIP assay showed that OCA and INT-767 strongly increased FXR and RXRα occupancy on the mouse Tgr5 promoter containing the FXRE compared with the vehicle-treated and non-immune-IgG control (Fig. 5D). INT-767 significantly increased PGC1α occupancy at the Tgr5 promoter consistent with the reporter assay in Fig. 5, B and D. OCA and INT-767 did not significantly affect the occupancy of nuclear receptor co-repressor 1 (NCoR1) to the Tgr5 promoter. Overall, these results suggest that the IR1 motif on the Tgr5 promoter binds FXR/RXRα in the present of OCA and INT-767. Activation of FXR by INT-767, but not OCA, recruits PGC1α to stimulate Tgr5 gene transcription indicating OCA is a weaker FXR agonist than INT-767. The role of intestinal FXR and TGR5 in stimulating glucose-induced GLP-1 secretion was further examined using wild-type, Fxr−/−, and Tgr5−/− mice. Glucose-induced GLP-1 secretion in serum was reduced by about 40% in Tgr5−/− or Fxr−/− mice as compared with wild-type mice indicating both receptors are involved in glucose-induced GLP-1 secretion (Fig. 6A). In Tgr5−/− mice, FXR is expressed, and INT-767 treatment significantly stimulated GLP-1 secretion indicating that activation of FXR stimulated GLP-1 secretion (Fig. 6B). In Fxr−/− mice, TGR5 is expressed at lower levels (see Fig. 4B), and INT-767 did not significantly increase GLP-1 secretion (Fig. 6C). These results indicate that both FXR and TGR5 are involved in stimulating GLP-1 secretion. However, FXR plays a critical role in GLP-1 secretion even in the absence of TGR5. To further study the effect of FXR agonists in the regulation of lipid metabolism, FXR target gene mRNA was measured in Tgr5−/− and Fxr−/− mice treated with INT-767 and INT-777. In Tgr5−/− mice, only INT-767 induced ApoCII and reduced ApoCIII, Serb-1c, Scd-1, and Cyp7a1, whereas no changes were observed in Fxr−/− mice, indicating that activation of FXR improved hepatic lipid metabolism in Tgr5−/− mice (Fig. 6D). However, neither INT-7"
https://openalex.org/W2613365198,"Bone marrow fibrosis is a critical component of primary myelofibrosis (PMF). However, the origin of the myofibroblasts that drive fibrosis is unknown. Using genetic fate mapping we found that bone marrow leptin receptor (Lepr)-expressing mesenchymal stromal lineage cells expanded extensively and were the fibrogenic cells in PMF. These stromal cells downregulated the expression of key haematopoietic-stem-cell-supporting factors and upregulated genes associated with fibrosis and osteogenesis, indicating fibrogenic conversion. Administration of imatinib or conditional deletion of platelet-derived growth factor receptor a (Pdgfra) from Lepr+ stromal cells suppressed their expansion and ameliorated bone marrow fibrosis. Conversely, activation of the PDGFRA pathway in bone marrow Lepr+ cells led to expansion of these cells and extramedullary haematopoiesis, features of PMF. Our data identify Lepr+ stromal lineage cells as the origin of myofibroblasts in PMF and suggest that targeting PDGFRA signalling could be an effective way to treat bone marrow fibrosis."
https://openalex.org/W2613338979,"The identification of distinct cell types in the basal ganglia has been critical to our understanding of basal ganglia function and the treatment of neurological disorders. The external globus pallidus (GPe) is a key contributor to motor suppressing pathways in the basal ganglia, yet its neuronal heterogeneity has remained an untapped resource for therapeutic interventions. Here we demonstrate that optogenetic interventions that dissociate the activity of two neuronal populations in the GPe, elevating the activity of parvalbumin (PV)-expressing GPe neurons over that of Lim homeobox 6 (Lhx6)-expressing GPe neurons, restores movement in dopamine-depleted mice and attenuates pathological activity of basal ganglia output neurons for hours beyond stimulation. These results establish the utility of cell-specific interventions in the GPe to target functionally distinct pathways, with the potential to induce long-lasting recovery of movement despite the continued absence of dopamine."
https://openalex.org/W2613861840,"Extended daytime and nighttime activities are major contributors to the growing sleep deficiency epidemic, as is the high prevalence of sleep disorders like insomnia. The consequences of chronic insufficient sleep for health remain uncertain. Sleep quality and duration predict presence of pain the next day in healthy subjects, suggesting that sleep disturbances alone may worsen pain, and experimental sleep deprivation in humans supports this claim. We demonstrate that sleep loss, but not sleep fragmentation, in healthy mice increases sensitivity to noxious stimuli (referred to as 'pain') without general sensory hyper-responsiveness. Moderate daily repeated sleep loss leads to a progressive accumulation of sleep debt and also to exaggerated pain responses, both of which are rescued after restoration of normal sleep. Caffeine and modafinil, two wake-promoting agents that have no analgesic activity in rested mice, immediately normalize pain sensitivity in sleep-deprived animals, without affecting sleep debt. The reversibility of mild sleep-loss-induced pain by wake-promoting agents reveals an unsuspected role for alertness in setting pain sensitivity. Clinically, insufficient or poor-quality sleep may worsen pain and this enhanced pain may be reduced not by analgesics, whose effectiveness is reduced, but by increasing alertness or providing better sleep."

https://openalex.org/W2612537388,"Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) play an essential role in metastasis. However, what enables TAMs to have a superior capacity to establish pre-metastatic microenvironment in distant organs is unclear. Here we have begun to uncover the effects of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 4A in TAMs on lung pre-metastatic niche formation and metastasis. CYP4A+ TAM infiltration was positively associated with metastasis, pre-metastatic niche formation and poor prognosis in breast cancer patients. The pharmacological inhibition of CYP4A reduced lung pre-metastatic niche formation (evidenced by a decrease in vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 1 positive (VEGFR1+) myeloid cell recruitment and pro-metastatic protein expression) and metastatic burden, accompanied with TAM polarization away from the M2 phenotype in spontaneous metastasis models of 4T1 breast cancer and B16F10 melanoma. Co-implantation of 4T1 cells with CYP4A10high macrophages promoted lung pre-metastatic niche formation and metastasis. Depletion of TAMs disrupted lung pre-metastatic niches and thereby prevented metastasis. Treatment with the CM from CYP4A10high M2 macrophages (M2) increased pre-metastatic niche formation and metastatic burden in the lungs, whereas CYP4A inhibition attenuated these effects. In vitro TAM polarization away from the M2 phenotype induced by CYP4A inhibition decreased VEGFR1+ myeloid cell migration and fibronectin expression, accompanied with downregulation of STAT3 signaling. Conversely, overexpression of CYP4A or exogenous addition of 20-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid promoted M2 polarization and cytokine production of macrophages and thereby enhanced migration of VEGFR1+ myeloid cells, which were reversed by siRNA or pharmacological inhibition of STAT3. Importantly, a combined blocking M2 macrophage-derived factors TGF-β, VEGF and SDF-1 abolished VEGFR1+ myeloid cell migration and fibroblast activation induced by CYP4A. In summary, CYP4A in TAMs is crucial for lung pre-metastatic niche formation and metastasis, and may serve as a potential therapeutic target in human cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2613374109,"TGF-β is a multifunctional cytokine affecting many cell types and implicated in tissue remodeling processes. Due to its many functions and cell-specific effects, the consequences of TGF-β signaling are process-and stage-dependent, and it is not uncommon that TGF-β exerts distinct and sometimes opposing effects on a disease progression depending on the stage and on the pathological changes associated with the stage. The mechanisms underlying cell- and process-specific effects of TGF-β are poorly understood. We are describing a novel pathway that mediates induction of angiogenesis in response to TGF-β1. We found that in endothelial cells (EC) thrombospondin-4 (TSP-4), a secreted extracellular matrix (ECM) protein, is upregulated in response to TGF-β1 and mediates the effects of TGF-β1 on angiogenesis. Upregulation of TSP-4 does not require the synthesis of new protein, is not caused by decreased secretion of TSP-4, and is mediated by activation of SMAD3. Using Thbs4-/- mice and TSP-4 shRNA, we found that TSP-4 mediated pro-angiogenic functions in cultured EC and angiogenesis in vivo in response to TGF-β1. We observed~3-fold increases in tumor mass and levels of angiogenesis markers in animals injected with TGF-β1, and these effects did not occur in Thbs4-/- animals. Injections of an inhibitor of TGF-β1 signaling SB-431542 also decreased the weights of tumors and cancer angiogenesis. Our results from in vivo angiogenesis models and cultured EC document that TSP-4 mediates upregulation of angiogenesis by TGF-β1. Upregulation of pro-angiogenic TSP-4 and selective effects of TSP-4 on EC may contribute to stimulation of tumor growth by TGF-β despite the inhibition of cancer cell proliferation."
https://openalex.org/W2613837800,"Although tetracyclines are an important class of antibiotics for use in agriculture and the clinic, their efficacy is threatened by increasing resistance. Resistance to tetracyclines can occur through efflux, ribosomal protection, or enzymatic inactivation. Surprisingly, tetracycline enzymatic inactivation has remained largely unexplored, despite providing the distinct advantage of antibiotic clearance. The tetracycline destructases are a recently discovered family of tetracycline-inactivating flavoenzymes from pathogens and soil metagenomes that have a high potential for broad dissemination. Here, we show that tetracycline destructases accommodate tetracycline-class antibiotics in diverse and novel orientations for catalysis, and antibiotic binding drives unprecedented structural dynamics facilitating tetracycline inactivation. We identify a key inhibitor binding mode that locks the flavin adenine dinucleotide cofactor in an inactive state, functionally rescuing tetracycline activity. Our results reveal the potential of a new tetracycline and tetracycline destructase inhibitor combination therapy strategy to overcome resistance by enzymatic inactivation and restore the use of an important class of antibiotics."

EDE levels of VCAM-1, von Willebrand factor, platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-BB, angiopoietin-1, and lysyl oxidase-2 and the cerebrovascular-selective proteins glucose transporter 1, permeability-glycoprotein, and large neutral amino acid transporter 1 were significantly higher for 18 patients with cerebrovascular disease (CeVD) than for 18 age- and gender-matched control subjects.

EDE levels of Yes-associated protein (YAP) were higher and of P(S127)-YAP lower in patients with CeVD than in control subjects, consistent with heightened activity of this mechanical force-sensitive system in atherosclerosis.

https://openalex.org/W2611654661,"Pancreatic cancer is a malignant neoplasm with a high mortality rate. Therapeutic agents that activate TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL)-induced apoptosis have shown promising efficacy, but many pancreatic cancers are resistant to TRAIL therapy. Epigenetic regulation plays important roles in tumor pathogenesis and resistance, and a recent study indicated that the long non-coding RNA HOX transcript antisense RNA (HOTAIR) is overexpressed in pancreatic cancer. However, the role of HOTAIR in pancreatic cancer resistance to anticancer agents is unknown. The present study determined the role of HOTAIR in pancreatic cancer TRAIL resistance and investigated the underlying molecular mechanisms. We observed that TRAIL-resistant pancreatic cancer cells had higher levels of HOTAIR expression, whereas TRAIL-sensitive pancreatic cancer cells had lower HOTAIR levels. Overexpressing HOTAIR in TRAIL-sensitive cells attenuated TRAIL-induced apoptosis, and shRNA-mediated HOTAIR knockdown in TRAIL-resistant PANC-1 cells sensitized them to TRAIL-induced apoptosis. These results support a causative effect of HOTAIR on TRAIL sensitivity. Mechanistically, we found that increased HOTAIR expression inhibited the expression of the TRAIL receptor death receptor 5 (DR5), whereas HOTAIR knockdown increased DR5 expression. We further demonstrated that HOTAIR regulates DR5 expression via the epigenetic regulator enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) and that EZH2 controls histone H3 lysine 27 trimethylation on the DR5 gene. Taken together, these results demonstrate that high HOTAIR levels increase the resistance of pancreatic cancer cells to TRAIL-induced apoptosis via epigenetic regulation of DR5 expression. Our study therefore supports the notion that targeting HOTAIR function may represent a strategy to overcome TRAIL resistance in pancreatic cancer."

They find recurrent noncoding regulatory mutations that correlate with differential expression of proximal genes and find that the strongest regulatory elements are more frequently mutated, suggesting a selective advantage for mutations in these regions. The contributions of coding mutations to tumorigenesis are relatively well known; however, little is known about somatic alterations in noncoding DNA. Here we describe GECCO (Genomic Enrichment Computational Clustering Operation) to analyze somatic noncoding alterations in 308 pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas (PDAs) and identify commonly mutated regulatory regions. We find recurrent noncoding mutations to be enriched in PDA pathways, including axon guidance and cell adhesion, and newly identified processes, including transcription and homeobox genes. We identified mutations in protein binding sites correlating with differential expression of proximal genes and experimentally validated effects of mutations on expression. We developed an expression modulation score that quantifies the strength of gene regulation imposed by each class of regulatory elements, and found the strongest elements were most frequently mutated, suggesting a selective advantage. Our detailed single-cancer analysis of noncoding alterations identifies regulatory mutations as candidates for diagnostic and prognostic markers, and suggests new mechanisms for tumor evolution."

The Aβ peptides, which form the core of the amyloid plaques, are produced by the sequential proteolytic cleavages of the β amyloid precursor protein (βAPP). βAPP can be processed by two alternative post-translational pathways: (i) an amyloidogenic route in which βAPP is cleaved by β-secretase (BACE-1) to generate a soluble sAPPβ fragment and a C-terminal fragment of 99 amino acids (C99), which is further cleaved by a presenilin (PS1 and PS2)-dependent γ-secretase complex to generate Aβ and AICD (APP intracellular domain) and (ii) a non-amyloidogenic pathway in which βAPP is sequentially hydrolyzed by α-secretase to produce a soluble sAPPα and a C-terminal fragment of 83 amino acids (C83). C83 is further cleaved by γ-secretase to generate a p3 peptide and AICD (3Pardossi-Piquard R. Checler F. The physiology of the β-amyloid precursor protein intracellular domain AICD.J.

Importantly, alteration of RyR-mediated Ca2+ release likely contributes to ER Ca2+ deregulation in AD (9Del Prete D. Checler F. Chami M. Ryanodine receptors: physiological function and deregulation in Alzheimer disease.Mol. Neurodegener. 2014; 9: 21Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). RyR dysfunction has been reported in AD models; however, the molecular mechanisms underlying RyR-mediated ER Ca2+ leak in AD are still not fully understood. RyR macromolecular complexes include four RyR protomers (565 kDa each) and several regulatory proteins including the RyR channel-stabilizing subunit calstabin. Recent studies have revealed that RyR-mediated ER Ca2+ depletion is linked to post-translational modifications (hypernitrosylation, hyperphosphorylation, oxidation) of the RyR macromolecular complexes resulting in calstabin depletion and “leaky RyR channels” (17Lanner J.T.

We used human SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells stably expressing pcDNA3.1 (control) or human βAPP harboring the double Swedish mutations (APPswe: APPKM670/671NL) constructs. We previously reported that SH-SY5Y cells expressing APPswe yield increased levels of APP C-terminal fragments (CTFs) fragments (C99 and C83) and of Aβ peptides (13Oulès B. Del Prete D. Greco B.

RyR2 was immunoprecipitated and immunoblotted for protein kinase A (PKA) phosphorylation (at residue Ser-2808), oxidation (2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazone (DNP)), nitrosylation (anti-Cys NO), and levels of the channel stabilizing subunit calstabin2 (FKBP12.6) in the RyR2 macromolecular complex. Neuronal RyR2 from control SH-SY5Y cells had no biochemical remodeling of the RyR2 macromolecular complex, whereas APPswe-expressing cells exhibited RyR2 PKA phosphorylation, oxidation, nitrosylation, and calstabin2 depletion (Fig. 1, A–E). RyR2 macromolecular complexes from APPswe-expressing cells also exhibited reduced levels of serine/threonine protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) and spinophilin (Fig. 1, A, F, and G) (24Marx S.O. Reiken S.

S107 had no effect on PKA phosphorylation or oxidation/nitrosylation of RyR2 (Fig. 1, A–D) but significantly prevented dissociation of calstabin2 from RyR2 channels (Fig. 1, A and E). S107 did not restore PP1 and spinophilin levels in RyR2 complexes (Fig. 1, A, F, and G). PKA phosphorylation of RyR2 occurs downstream of β2-AR activation (24Marx S.O. Reiken S. Hisamatsu Y.

In addition, we already reported that PKA, H2O2, and Noc-12 (NO-donor) individually caused a ˜2-fold and, in combination, caused an ˜4-fold decrease in the binding affinity of calstabin2 to neuronal RyR2 (19Liu X.

Because the β2-AR has been reported to trigger AD-related biochemical and anatomical alterations (20Ni Y. Zhao X. Bao G. Zou L. Teng L. Wang Z. Song M. Xiong J. Bai Y. Pei G.

Chem. 2013; 288: 10298-10307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), we examined the effects of β2-AR blockade on RyR2 post-translational modifications and remodeling. The selective β2-AR antagonist ICI118–551 (ICI) prevented RyR2 PKA phosphorylation, oxidation, nitrosylation, and depletion of calstabin2 (Fig. 1, A–E) without affecting PP1 and spinophilin levels on RyR2 complex (Fig. 1, A, F, and G). We further performed several tests to ascertain that RyR2 post-translational remodeling occurs through β2-AR in our study model. Indeed, SH-SY5Y cells express both β1- and β2-AR but not β3-AR (29Mikami M. Goubaeva F. Song J.H. Lee H.T. Yang J. β-Adrenoceptor blockers protect against staurosporine-induced apoptosis in SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells.Eur. J. Pharmacol. 2008; 589: 14-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). APPswe cells were treated using increasing concentrations of the β2-AR antagonist ICI (Fig. 2, A and B), the PKA inhibitor (H-89) (Fig. 2, C and D), or the β1-AR antagonist CGP 20712A (Fig. 2, E and F). We show that complete blockade of RyR2 phosphorylation and calstabin2 dissociation from RyR2 was obtained with ICI at 10 nm, 0.1 μm, and 1 μm (Fig. 2, A and B). Accordingly, we also observed a dose-dependent blockade of RyR2 post-translational remodeling in APPswe cells with H-89 with a maximal effect at 1 μm and 5 μm (Fig. 2, C and D). Importantly, treatment of APPswe cells with the β1-AR antagonist CGP 20712A up to 1 μm did not modify either RyR2 phosphorylation or calstabin2 binding to RyR2 (Fig. 2, E and F). Although H-89 does not behave as a fully specific inhibitor of PKA (30Lochner A. Moolman J.A. The many faces of H89: a review.Cardiovasc. Drug Rev. 2006; 24: 261-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar), it supports our view that RyR2 post-translational remodeling in APPswe-expressing cells occurs specifically and in a dose-dependent manner through β2-AR activation (Fig. 2, A–F). We then sought to determine the potential influence of Aβ or other APP metabolites on the RyR2 macromolecular complex remodeling. We used an Aβ preparation containing soluble Aβ oligomers (considered as the most toxic forms of Aβ) (Fig. 3I and Ref. 31Guillot-Sestier M.V. Sunyach C. Ferreira S.T. Marzolo M.P. Bauer C. Thevenet A. Checler F. α-Secretase-derived fragment of cellular prion, N1, protects against monomeric and oligomeric amyloid β (Aβ)-associated cell death.J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287: 5021-5032Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) and found that exposure of control human SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells to Aβ (1–5 nm, 30–60 min) resulted in RyR2 PKA phosphorylation, oxidation, nitrosylation, and depletion of calstabin2 from the RyR2 macromolecular complex (Fig. 3, A–E). However, in contrast to SH-SY5Y-APPswe cells, the amounts of PP1 and spinophilin in the RyR2 complex were unaffected by acute treatment with Aβ (Fig. 3, A, F, and G). Pretreatment with S107 reduced Aβ-induced calstabin2 depletion from the RyR2 macromolecular complex (Fig. 3, A and E). We also show that treatment of SH-SY5Y control cells with increasing concentrations of the β-AR agonist isoproterenol induces RyR2 phosphorylation associated with a dissociation of calstabin2 from RyR2 (Fig. 2, G and H). ICI inhibited Aβ-induced RyR2 remodeling, thus preventing RyR2 PKA phosphorylation, oxidation, nitrosylation, and calstabin2 depletion (Fig. 3, A–E). Neither S107 nor ICI affected PP1 and spinophilin levels in the RyR2 complex. Acute Aβ exposure increased cAMP levels (14.2 ± 0.2 versus 8.0 ± 0.3 pmol/mg), which was inhibited by ICI (7.9 ± 0.1 pmol/mg) (Fig. 3H), suggesting that Aβ acts upstream of β2-AR signaling. These data and those of Fig. 1 demonstrate that RyR2 remodeling is likely linked to Aβ (Figure 1, Figure 3, A and H) and to β2-AR activation (Fig. 2, A–H). Because our Aβ preparation contains monomeric and low molecular weight oligomeric forms of Aβ, we cannot attribute the observed effects to a specific Aβ species. We could detect only a moderate elevation of cAMP levels in APPswe model (˜20% increase over control cells considered as 100%, n = 3; data not shown), but data were obtained at only one time point. Thus, other experiments will be necessary to unravel time-dependent modulation of cAMP production in the APPswe model. We also used a pharmacological approach to modulate APP metabolism by using β-secretase (LY288672, 30 μm) or γ-secretase (ELND006, 5 μm) inhibitors and investigate the potential implication of other βAPP metabolites in RyR2 remodeling. Although inhibition of β-secretase reduces C99 fragment production and enhances the level of C83 fragment, γ-secretase inhibition enhances the levels of both C99 and C83 fragments (Fig. 3, J and K). As expected, β- and γ-secretase inhibitors fully block intracellular and extracellular Aβ production (Fig. 3, L–O). Interestingly, blocking β-secretase or γ-secretase reduces RyR2 PKA phosphorylation, oxidation, nitrosylation, and calstabin2 depletion in APPswe-expressing cells (Fig. 3, P–T). We previously reported that SH-SY5Y cells expressing APPswe display increased cytosolic Ca2+ due to increased Ca2+ release from the ER via IP3R and RyR and enhanced Ca2+ entry via voltage-dependent and voltage-independent plasma membrane Ca2+ channels (13Oulès B. Del Prete D. Greco B. Zhang X. Lauritzen I. Sevalle J. Moreno S. Paterlini-Bréchot P. Trebak M. Checler F. Benfenati F. Chami M. Ryanodine receptor blockade reduces amyloid-β load and memory impairments in Tg2576 mouse model of Alzheimer disease.J. Neurosci. 2012; 32: 11820-11834Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). We now report that SH-SY5Y cells expressing APPswe exhibit increased basal cytosolic Ca2+ signals compared with control cells (Fig. 4, A and B). Accordingly, exogenous Aβ treatment of SH-SY5Y cells for 12 h (an experimental condition mimicking APPswe cells chronically overproducing Aβ) also results in elevated basal [Ca2+]cyt (Fig. 4, C and D). As previously reported (35Demuro A. Mina E. Kayed R. Milton S.C. Parker I. Glabe C.G. Calcium dysregulation and membrane disruption as a ubiquitous neurotoxic mechanism of soluble amyloid oligomers.J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 17294-17300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (844) Google Scholar), acute application of Aβ to human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells induced a slow rise of [Ca2+]cyt (Fig. 4, E and F). Interestingly, Aβ-induced Ca2+ elevation was prevented by S107, ICI, or ryanodine pretreatment (ΔF/F0 = 1.95 ± 0.16 (n = 57), 0.63 ± 0.08 (n = 31), 0.28 ± 0.08 (n = 44), 0.63 ± 0.09 (n = 23) in Aβ, Aβ+S107-, Aβ+ICI-, and Aβ+ryanodine-treated cells, respectively) (Fig. 4, E and F). Our finding is in accordance with data showing that preincubation with inhibitory ryanodine virtually eliminated the generation of Ca2+ signals elicited by oligomeric Aβ in primary hippocampal neurons (36Paula-Lima A.C. Adasme T. SanMartín C. Sebollela A. Hetz C. Carrasco M.A. Ferreira S.T. Hidalgo C. Amyloid β-peptide oligomers stimulate RyR-mediated Ca2+ release inducing mitochondrial fragmentation in hippocampal neurons and prevent RyR-mediated dendritic spine remodeling produced by BDNF.Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2011; 14: 1209-1223Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). S107, ICI, and ryanodine did not completely reverse the rise in [Ca2+]cyt. This may indicate that, in addition to leaky RyR2, there are other components that contribute to the Aβ-induced rise in [Ca2+]cyt. Possibilities include: 1) intracellular Ca2+ release via the IP3Rs and 2) Ca2+ entry through the plasma membrane as previously reported (13Oulès B. Del Prete D. Greco B. Zhang X. Lauritzen I. Sevalle J. Moreno S. Paterlini-Bréchot P. Trebak M. Checler F. Benfenati F. Chami M. Ryanodine receptor blockade reduces amyloid-β load and memory impairments in Tg2576 mouse model of Alzheimer disease.J. Neurosci. 2012; 32: 11820-11834Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Accordingly, Aβ-mediated Ca2+ elevation is lower in nominally Ca2+-free extracellular medium, and this elevation is completely reversed by ryanodine (data not shown). We also analyzed basal [Ca2+]cyt in APPswe cells untreated or treated with S107 or ICI (Fig. 4, A and B). We show that S107 or blocking β2-adrenergic signaling by ICI significantly reduce basal [Ca2+]cyt in APPswe-expressing cells (Fig. 4, A and B). It is known that IP3Rs are activated by Ins(1,4,5)P3, a metabolic product of GPCR activity, and that the activation of these channels is amplified by Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release, a regenerative mechanism by which Ca2+ enhances its own release from IP3Rs and RyRs (37Finch E.A. Turner T.J. Goldin S.M. Calcium as a coagonist of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate-induced calcium release.Science. 1991; 252: 443-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar). Accordingly, it was already reported that exacerbated IP3R-evoked Ca2+ signals in the PS1M146V- and the 3×Tg-AD-derived neurons occur through increased Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release through the RyR (15Stutzmann G.E. Smith I. Caccamo A. Oddo S. Laferla F.M. Parker I. Enhanced ryanodine receptor recruitment contributes to Ca2+ disruptions in young, adult, and aged Alzheimer's disease mice.J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 5180-5189Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). We show herein that increased inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate-mediated cytosolic Ca2+ signal (carbachol stimulation) in APPswe (Fig. 4, G–J) contributed to RyR-mediated Ca2+ release/leak. Thus, stabilization of calstabin2 on RyR2 channels by S107 or blockade of RyR2 phosphorylation by ICI (Fig. 4, G0-J), both, lowers carbachol-mediated cytosolic Ca2+ signals as revealed by reduced peak values and"

https://openalex.org/W2612535031,"The lethality of the aggressive brain tumor glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) results in part from its strong propensity to invade surrounding normal brain tissue. Although oncogenic drivers such as epidermal growth factor receptor activation and Phosphatase and Tensin homolog inactivation are thought to promote the motility and invasiveness of GBM cells via phosphatidylinostitol 3-kinase activation, other unexplored mechanisms may also contribute to malignancy. Here we demonstrate that several components of the planar cell polarity (PCP) arm of non-canonical Wnt signaling including VANGL1, VANGL2 and FZD7 are transcriptionally upregulated in glioma and correlate with poorer patient outcome. Knockdown of the core PCP pathway component VANGL1 suppresses the motility of GBM cell lines, pointing to an important mechanistic role for this pathway in glioblastoma malignancy. We further observe that restoration of Nrdp1, a RING finger type E3 ubiquitin ligase whose suppression in GBM also correlates with poor prognosis, reduces GBM cell migration and invasiveness by suppressing PCP signaling. Our observations indicate that Nrdp1 physically interacts with the Vangl1 and Vangl2 proteins to mediate the K63-linked polyubiquitination of the Dishevelled, Egl-10 and Pleckstrin (DEP) domain of the Wnt pathway protein Dishevelled (Dvl). Ubiquitination hinders Dvl binding to phosphatidic acid, an interaction necessary for efficient Dvl recruitment to the plasma membrane upon Wnt stimulation of Fzd receptor and for the propagation of downstream signals. We conclude that the PCP pathway contributes significantly to the motility and hence the invasiveness of GBM cells, and that Nrdp1 acts as a negative regulator of PCP signaling by inhibiting Dvl through a novel polyubiquitination mechanism. We propose that the upregulation of core PCP components, together with the loss of the key negative regulator Nrdp1, act coordinately to promote GBM invasiveness and malignancy."

After cycles of mitosis and meiosis, the haploid spermatids undergo drastic morphological changes to transform from a spherical cell into a polarized, elongated spermatozoon in a process called spermiogenesis (1Cooke H.J.

In this process, a large, mainly Golgi-derived membrane-enclosed structure, the acrosome, is formed on the anterior part of the sperm head. The acrosome plays a crucial role during fertilization. Mice and men in which all spermatozoa lack acrosomes are infertile (2Dam A.H.D.M. Feenstra I. Westphal J.R. Ramos L. van Golde R.J.T. Kremer J.A.M. Globozoospermia revisited.Hum. Reprod.

These can be divided into two subfamilies: a plasma membrane subfamily including NHE1–5 and an organellar subfamily comprising NHE6–9. Plasma membrane NHEs are involved in the absorption of salt and water in epithelia and in regulating cytoplasmic pH, osmolarity, and cell volume. Knock-out mouse models have implicated these transporters in disorders like epilepsy and seizures, diarrhea, or metabolic acidosis (6Schultheis P.J. Clarke L.L. Meneton P. Miller M.L. Soleimani M.

Loss of plasma membrane NHE3 (SLC9A3) leads to increased fluid volume in the epididymis, thereby diminishing sperm concentration (31Zhou Q. Clarke L. Nie R. Carnes K. Lai L.W. Lien Y.H. Verkman A. Lubahn D. Fisher J.S. Katzenellenbogen B.S. Hess R.A. Estrogen action and male fertility: roles of the sodium/hydrogen exchanger-3 and fluid reabsorption in reproductive tract function.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2001; 98: 14132-14137Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Loss of the so-called sperm NHE (sNHE, a member (SLC9C1) of the SLC9C gene family) drastically reduces sperm motility and causes male infertility (32Wang D. King S.M. Quill T.A. Doolittle L.K. Garbers D.L. A new sperm-specific Na+/H+ exchanger required for sperm motility and fertility.Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 1117-1122Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). sNHE, which contains additional voltage-sensor and nucleotide binding domains, localizes to the flagellum of mouse spermatozoa, where it may participate in a signaling complex at the plasma membrane (33Wang D. Hu J. Bobulescu I.A. Quill T.A. McLeroy P. Moe O.W. Garbers D.L. A sperm-specific Na+/H+ exchanger (sNHE) is critical for expression and in vivo bicarbonate regulation of the soluble adenylyl cyclase (sAC).Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 9325-9330Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Here we analyzed the role of NHE8 in male reproductive function. Mice lacking NHE8 globally or specifically only in germ cells produced round-headed spermatozoa lacking the acrosomal cap. This resembles human globozoospermia which likewise is associated with infertility. Instead of acrosomes, Nhe8−/− spermatids displayed isolated, sometimes nucleus-attached Golgi-derived vesicles (GDVs). Hence NHE8 may play a crucial role in the fusion of GDVs to form acrosomes. Our work suggests NHE8 as a candidate gene for human globozoospermia and as a possible drug target for male contraception. We established Nhe8−/− mice (Fig. 1A) to elucidate physiological roles of NHE8. Wild-type (WT), Nhe8+/−, and Nhe8−/− mice were born at Mendelian ratio (Fig. 1H), grew normally, and all littermates were superficially indistinguishable. Complete loss of NHE8 protein in Nhe8−/− mice was confirmed in several organs by immunoblot analysis which in the WT showed NHE8 signals of ∼60 and 85 kDa as reported (22Goyal S. Vanden Heuvel G. Aronson P.S. Renal expression of novel Na+/H+ exchanger isoform NHE8.Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2003; 284: F467-F473Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1B). NHE8 expression was prominent in kidney, testes, and epididymis, but very low in the female reproductive system (Fig. 1B). Although we frequently obtained offspring from Nhe8−/− females, male Nhe8−/− mice never produced progeny, as reported previously (26Xu H. Zhang B. Li J. Wang C. Chen H. Ghishan F.K.

J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2015; 308: C330-C338Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Vaginal plugs observed in breedings with male Nhe8−/− mice indicated normal mating behavior, libido, copulation, and ejaculation. Body (WT, 27.5 ± 1.5 g; Nhe8−/−, 26.4 ± 1.0 g; n = 12) and testes weight (WT, 0.57 ± 0.03% of body weight; Nhe8−/−, 0.59 ± 0.04% of body weight; n = 12) was unchanged in Nhe8−/− mice. Their male reproductive systems appeared macroscopically normal (Fig. 1C), as did their seminiferous tubules (Fig. 1E), the diameters of which were unchanged (Fig. 1I). Seminiferous tubules of both WT and Nhe8−/− mice contained spermatozoa (Fig. 1F) and the epididymal sperm concentration was not significantly different (Fig. 1J). Contrasting with the typical elongated heads of WT spermatozoa (Fig. 1G, top), Nhe8−/− spermatozoa had round heads, within seminiferous tubules (Fig. 1G, bottom) or the cauda epididymis (Fig. 1D). Their motility was drastically reduced (Fig. 1K). Nhe8−/− spermatozoa lacked acrosomes and showed an abnormal distribution of mitochondria which were found in sperm heads instead of forming a sheath around the initial part of the flagellum. This was revealed by crosses with “green sperm” mice (34Hasuwa H. Muro Y. Ikawa M. Kato N. Tsujimoto Y. Okabe M. Transgenic mouse sperm that have green acrosome and red mitochondria allow visualization of sperm and their acrosome reaction in vivo.Exp. Anim. 2010; 59: 105-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) that express dsRed in mitochondria and GFP in acrosomes (Fig. 2A) and by labeling acrosomes with peanut agglutinin (PNA) (35Mortimer D. Curtis E.F. Miller R.G. Specific labelling by peanut agglutinin of the outer acrosomal membrane of the human spermatozoon.J. Reprod. Fertil. 1987; 81: 127-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar) and mitochondria with MitoTracker® (Fig. 2B) and ascertained by transmission electron microscopic (TEM) images (Fig. 3, A–D). Because the mitochondrial sheath provides ATP for flagellar movement (36Ramalho-Santos J. Varum S. Amaral S. Mota P.C. Sousa A.P. Amaral A. Mitochondrial functionality in reproduction: from gonads and gametes to embryos and embryonic stem cells.Hum. Reprod. Update. 2009; 15: 553-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar), this finding might explain the reduced motility of Nhe8−/− spermatozoa.Figure 3Defective formation of the acrosome and mitochondrial sheath in Nhe8−/− mice is shown.

Tanaka S. Teko Y. Mitsui K. Kanazawa H. Four Na+/H+ exchanger isoforms are distributed to Golgi and post-Golgi compartments and are involved in organelle pH regulation.J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 1561-1572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar) points to a germ cell-intrinsic effect, but also defects in germ-cell nurturing Sertoli cells or hormone-producing Leydig cells may cause infertility (37Zhang F.P. Poutanen M. Wilbertz J. Huhtaniemi I. Normal prenatal but arrested postnatal sexual development of luteinizing hormone receptor knockout (LuRKO) mice.Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 172-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). X-Gal staining of testes from mice carrying the lacZ reporter gene in the Nhe8 locus (Fig. 1A) revealed Nhe8 transcription in seminiferous tubules, but not in intertubular Leydig cells (Fig. 2C). Immunofluorescence detected NHE8 protein in WT (but not Nhe8−/−) germ cells, where it localized to an acrosome-like structure in close proximity to the nucleus (Fig. 2D). NHE8 perfectly co-localized with the acrosomal marker PNA in all four phases of spermiogenesis (Fig. 2E). Absence of immunoreactivity in Nhe8−/− testes (Fig. 2D) confirmed the specificity of labeling of preacrosomal granules. However, it cannot strictly guarantee that NHE8 is expressed on mature acrosomes because these structures are not present in Nhe8−/− testes. Comparison of spermiogenesis between the genotypes showed that only the Golgi phase appeared normal in Nhe8−/− mice (Fig. 2F). Instead of a single acrosomal granule that grows and flattens in WT mice, many small PNA-positive vesicles were detected on the nuclear surface in Nhe8−/− spermatids (Fig. 2F, cap phase). In the maturation phase, the resulting acrosome-less Nhe8−/− spermatids failed to obtain the typical elongated shape, although nuclei were condensed (Fig. 2F, maturation phase). TEM of WT testis showed the generation of acrosomal granules by fusion of GDVs, their attachment to the nucleus (Fig. 3E), growth, and flattening (Fig. 3F), as well as nuclear elongation (Fig. 3G). By contrast, in Nhe8−/− mice GDVs accumulated in the region between the Golgi and the nucleus (Fig. 3, H and I) but failed to generate larger granules or acrosomal caps. GDVs were more electron-dense in Nhe8−/− cells. Although spermatozoa in the seminiferous tubules of Nhe8−/− mice had condensed chromatin, their nuclei frequently displayed irregular shapes (Fig. 3J). The preacrosomal granule is attached to the nucleus by a cytoskeletal scaffold, the acroplaxome (38Kierszenbaum A.L. Rivkin E. Tres L.L. Acroplaxome, an F-actin-keratin-containing plate, anchors the acrosome to the nucleus during shaping of the spermatid head.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 4628-4640Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). The acroplaxome was visible in TEM as a dense plate in the subacrosomal space in WT spermatids (Fig. 3K) as well as in the space between the nucleus and the GDVs in Nhe8−/− spermatids (Fig. 3, L and M). This indicates that the defects in acrosome biogenesis are probably caused by impaired fusion of GDVs, whereas tethering of these vesicles to the nuclear envelope seems to be unaffected. Our data suggest that NHE8 is directly involved in acrosome biogenesis and that disruption of this process causes the infertility of Nhe8−/− mice. To test this hypothesis, Nhe8 was specifically deleted in Sertoli or germ cells by crossing Nhe8lox/lox mice with AMH-Cre (39Lécureuil C. Fontaine I. Crepieux P. Guillou F. Sertoli and granulosa cell-specific Cre recombinase activity in transgenic mice.Genesis. 2002; 33: 114-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar) and Stra8-iCre (40Sadate-Ngatchou P.I. Payne C.J. Dearth A.T. Braun R.E. Cre recombinase activity specific to postnatal, premeiotic male germ cells in transgenic mice.Genesis. 2008; 46: 738-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar) mice, respectively. Specificity of Cre expression was ascertained by crosses with R26R reporter mice (41Soriano P. Generalized lacZ expression with the ROSA26 Cre reporter strain.Nat. Genet. 1999; 21: 70-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (4153) Google Scholar) (Figs. 4A and 5A). In the following, we refer to the resulting Sertoli cell- and germ cell-specific knock-out mice as SC-ΔNHE8 and GC-ΔNHE8 mice, respectively. NHE8 protein levels of SC-ΔNHE8 testes were indistinguishable from WT mice, indicating that NHE8 is not, or is only at very low levels, expressed in Sertoli cells (Fig. 4B). As expected, male SC-ΔNHE8 mice were fertile and always produced offspring when mated over a 2-month period (n = 7 SC-ΔNHE8 males). Neither morphology and diameter of seminiferous tubules (Fig. 4, C and E), nor sperm morphology was affected (Fig. 4, E and F). Spermatozoa from SC-ΔNHE8 mice displayed normal acrosomal caps and mitochondrial sheaths (Fig. 4G). Hence NHE8 is dispensable in Sertoli cells for normal sperm development and fertility. In contrast, testicular NHE8 protein levels were drastically reduced in GC-ΔNHE8 mice (Fig. 4B), indicating that in mouse testes NHE8 is predominantly expressed in germ cells. The testicular phenotype of GC-ΔNHE8 mice appeared identical to that of Nhe8−/−, except for the finding that ∼5% of spermatozoa from GC-ΔNHE8 mice appeared normal, which can be attributed to the known ∼95% deletion efficiency of Stra8-iCre mice (40Sadate-Ngatchou P.I. Payne C.J. Dearth A.T. Braun R.E. Cre recombinase activity specific to postnatal, premeiotic male germ cells in transgenic mice.Genesis. 2008; 46: 738-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). The identical phenotype included male infertility (n = 15 GC-ΔNHE8 males), normal morphology and diameter of the seminiferous tubules (Figs. 4C and 5C), and the presence of round-headed sperm (Fig. 5, C and D) lacking both acrosomes and mitochondrial sheaths (Fig. 5E). Acrosome biogenesis was similarly affected in global and germ cell-specific Nhe8−/− mice (Fig. 5F and Fig. 6, A–F). The only ∼95% deletion efficiency of Stra8-iCre mice allowed us to directly compare WT and NHE8-deficient cells side by side in sections from GC-ΔNHE8 mice. NHE8-positive cells displayed acrosomal caps and elongated nuclei (Fig. 6, G and H, yellow arrows), whereas NHE8-deficient cells in the same tubule lacked acrosomes and had round nuclei. We conclude that NHE8 is required in germ cells for intact acrosome biogenesis, sperm development, and male fertility.Figure 5Germ cell-specific disruption of Nhe8 leads to round-headed acrosome-less spermatozoa.

https://openalex.org/W2612620582,"Objectives Given their flexibility, online interventions may be useful as an outpatient treatment option to support vocational reintegration after inpatient rehabilitation. To that purpose we devised a transdiagnostic psychodynamic online intervention to facilitate return to work, focusing on interpersonal conflicts at the workplace often responsible for work-related stress. Research design and methods In a randomized controlled trial, we included employed patients from cardiologic, psychosomatic and orthopedic rehabilitation with work-related stress or need for support at intake to inpatient rehabilitation after they had given written consent to take part in the study. Following discharge, maladaptive interpersonal interactions at the workplace were identified via weekly blogs and processed by written therapeutic comments over 12 weeks in the intervention group (IG). The control group (CG) received an augmented treatment as usual condition. The main outcome, subjective prognosis of gainful employment (SPE), and secondary outcomes (psychological complaints) were assessed by means of online questionnaires before, at the end of aftercare (3 months) and at follow-up (12 months). We used ITT analyses controlling for baseline scores and medical group. Results N = 319 patients were enrolled into IG and N = 345 into CG. 77% of the IG logged in to the webpage (CG 74%) and 65% of the IG wrote blogs. Compared to the CG, the IG reported a significantly more positive SPE at follow-up. Measures of depression, anxiety and psychosocial stressors decreased from baseline to follow-up, whereas the corresponding scores increased in the CG. Correspondingly, somatization and psychological quality of life improved in the IG. Conclusions Psychodynamic online aftercare was effective to enhance subjective prognosis of future employment and improved psychological complaints across a variety of chronic physical and psychological conditions, albeit with small effect sizes."

https://openalex.org/W2613973112,"MYC activation at modest levels has been frequently found in hepatocellular carcinoma. However, its significance in hepatocarcinogenesis has remained obscure. Here we examined the role of Myc activation in mouse liver tumours induced by hepatocytic expression of myristoylated AKT (AKT) and/or mutant HRASV12 (HRAS) via transposon-mediated gene integration. AKT or HRAS alone required 5 months to induce liver tumours, whereas their combination generated hepatocellular carcinoma within 8 weeks. Co-introduction of AKT and HRAS induced lipid-laden preneoplastic cells that grew into nodules composed of tumour cells with or without intracytoplasmic lipid, with the latter being more proliferative and associated with spontaneous Myc expression. AKT/HRAS-induced tumorigenesis was almost completely abolished when MadMyc, a competitive Myc inhibitor, was expressed simultaneously. The Tet-On induction of MadMyc in preneoplastic cells significantly inhibited the progression of AKT/HRAS-induced tumours; its induction in transformed cells suppressed their proliferative activity with alterations in lipid metabolism and protein translation. Transposon-mediated Myc overexpression facilitated tumorigenesis by AKT or HRAS, and when it was co-introduced with AKT and HRAS, diffusely infiltrating tumours without lipid accumulation developed as early as 2 weeks. Examination of the dose-responses of Myc in the enhancement of AKT/HRAS-induced tumorigenesis revealed that a reduction to one-third retained enhancing effect but three-times greater introduction damped the process with increased apoptosis. Myc overexpression suppressed the mRNA expression of proteins involved in the synthesis of fatty acids, and when combined with HRAS introduction, it also suppressed the mRNA expression of proteins involved in their degradation. Finally, the MYC-positive human hepatocellular carcinoma was characterized by the cytoplasm devoid of lipid accumulation, prominent nucleoli and a higher proliferative activity. Our results demonstrate that in hepatocarcinogenesis induced by both activated AKT and HRAS, activation of endogenous Myc is an enhancing factor and adequate levels of Myc deregulation further facilitate the process with alterations in cellular metabolism."

It is unknown whether vitamin D repletion in children with asymptomatic serum vitamin D deficiency can restore normal growth. Objective We tested the impact of vitamin D-supplementation on serum concentrations of 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] and short-term growth in Mongol children, with very low serum vitamin D levels in winter. Design We conducted two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials in urban school age children without clinical signs of rickets. The Supplementation Study was a 6-month intervention with an 800 IU vitamin D3 supplement daily, compared with placebo, in 113 children aged 12–15 years. A second study, the Fortification Study, was a 7-week intervention with 710 ml of whole milk fortified with 300 IU vitamin D3 daily, compared with unfortified milk, in 235 children aged 9–11 years. Results At winter baseline, children had low vitamin D levels, with a mean (±SD) serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] concentration of 7.3 (±3.9) ng/ml in the Supplementation Study and 7.5 (±3.8) ng/ml in the Fortification Study. The serum levels increased in both vitamin D groups—by 19.8 (±5.1) ng/ml in the Supplementation Study, and 19.7 (±6.1) ng/ml in the Fortification Study. Multivariable analysis showed a 0.9 (±0.3 SE) cm greater increase in height in the vitamin-D treated children, compared to placebo treated children, in the 6-month Supplementation Study (p = 0.003). Although the children in the 7-week Fortification Study intervention arm grew 0.2 (±0.1) cm more, on average, than placebo children this difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.2). There were no significant effects of vitamin D supplements on differences in changes in weight or body mass index in either trial. For the Fortification Study, girls gained more weight than boys while taking vitamin D 3 (p-value for interaction = 0.03), but sex was not an effect modifier of the relationship between vitamin D3 and change in either height or BMI in either trial. Conclusions Correcting vitamin D deficiency in children with very low serum vitamin D levels using 800 IU of vitamin D3 daily for six months increased growth, at least in the short-term, whereas, in a shorter trial of 300 IU of D fortified milk daily for 7 weeks did not."
https://openalex.org/W2612805392,"BRD4 has emerged as an important factor in tumorigenesis by promoting the transcription of genes involved in cancer development. However, how BRD4 is regulated in cancer cells remains largely unknown. Here, we report that the stability and functions of BRD4 are positively regulated by prolyl isomerase PIN1 in gastric cancer cells. PIN1 directly binds to phosphorylated threonine (T) 204 of BRD4 as revealed by peptide binding and crystallographic studies and enhances BRD4’s stability by inhibiting its ubiquitination. PIN1 also catalyses the isomerization of proline 205 of BRD4 and induces its conformational change, which promotes its interaction with CDK9 and increases BRD4’s transcriptional activity. Substitution of BRD4 with PIN1-binding-defective BRD4-T204A mutant in gastric cancer cells reduces BRD4’s stability, attenuates BRD4-mediated gene expression by impairing its interaction with CDK9 and suppresses gastric cancer cell proliferation, migration and invasion, and tumor formation. Our results identify BRD4 as a new target of PIN1 and suggest that interfering with their interaction could be a potential therapeutic approach for cancer treatment."

MCM8, one of the MCM proteins playing a critical role in DNA repairing and recombination, was found to have overexpression and increased DNA copy number in a variety of human malignancies. The gain of MCM8 is associated with aggressive clinical features of several human cancers. Increased expression of MCM8 in prostate cancer is associated with cancer recurrence. Forced expression of MCM8 in RWPE1 cells, the immortalized but non-transformed prostate epithelial cell line, exhibited fast cell growth and transformation, while knock down of MCM8 in PC3, DU145 and LNCaP cells induced cell growth arrest, and decreased tumour volumes and mortality of severe combined immunodeficiency mice xenografted with PC3 and DU145 cells. MCM8 bound cyclin D1 and activated Rb protein phosphorylation by cyclin-dependent kinase 4 in vitro and in vivo. The cyclin D1/MCM8 interaction is required for Rb phosphorylation and S-phase entry in cancer cells. As a result, our study showed that copy number increase and overexpression of MCM8 may play critical roles in human cancer development."

Drosophila TG is encoded by one gene and has two alternative splicing-derived isoforms, TG-A and TG-B, which contain distinct N-terminal 46- and 38-amino acid sequences, respectively. The TGs identified to date do not have a typical endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-signal peptide, and the molecular mechanisms of their secretion under physiologic conditions are unclear. Immunocytochemistry revealed that TG-A localizes to multivesicular-like structures, whereas TG-B localizes to the cytosol. We also found that TG-A, but not TG-B, was modified concomitantly by N-myristoylation and S-palmitoylation, and N-myristoylation was a pre-requisite for S-palmitoylation. Moreover, TG-A, but not TG-B, was secreted in response to calcium signaling induced by Ca2+ ionophores and uracil, a pathogenic bacteria-derived substance. Brefeldin A and monensin, inhibitors of the ER/Golgi-mediated conventional pathway, did not suppress TG-A secretion, whereas inhibition of S-palmitoylation by 2-bromopalmitate blocked TG-A secretion. Ultracentrifugation, electron microscopy analyses, and treatments with inhibitors of multivesicular body formation revealed that TG-A was secreted via exosomes together with co-transfected mammalian CD63, an exosomal marker, and the secreted TG-A was taken up by other cells. The 8-residue N-terminal fragment of TG-A containing the fatty acylation sites was both necessary and sufficient for the exosome-dependent secretion of TG-A.

The broadly conserved Rad51/RecA family of recombinases catalyzes the DNA strand invasion reaction that takes place during homologous recombination. We have established single-stranded (ss)DNA curtain assays for measuring individual base triplet steps during the early stages of strand invasion. Here, we examined how base triplet stepping by RecA, Rad51, and Dmc1 is affected by DNA sequence imperfections, such as single and multiple mismatches, abasic sites, and single nucleotide insertions.

Here, we examine how sequence imperfections affect individual base triplet steps by E. coli RecA, Saccharomyces cerevisiae Rad51, and S. cerevisiae Dmc1. We show that RecA, Rad51, and Dmc1 all require perfect Watson-Crick pairing interactions to stabilize base triplet pairing interactions at either the 5′ or 3′ termini of paired intermediates. Single nucleotide insertions completely disrupt base triplet recognition by all three recombinases, underscoring the importance of maintaining proper sequence register during strand exchange. RecA and Rad51 can step over base triplets harboring single mismatches or abasic sites, and Rad51 can step over tandem mismatches, but neither of these recombinases can stabilize the imperfectly paired triplets. In contrast, the meiosis-specific recombinase Dmc1 can step over and stabilize base triplets harboring single mismatches, multiple mismatches, and even abasic sites. Our results are consistent with a model where Dmc1 makes compensatory protein-DNA contacts with lesion-bearing or otherwise mismatched base triplets allowing stabilization of the resulting intermediates. We used ssDNA curtains and total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy to visualize RecA, Rad51, or Dmc1 pre-synaptic complexes.

These assays, together with accompanying molecular dynamics simulations, revealed that strand invasion intermediates were stabilized in 3-nt increments (28Lee J.Y. Terakawa T. Qi Z. Steinfeld J.B.

Here, we sought to determine whether similar results would be obtained if we instead extended the tract of microhomology in the 3′ → 5′ direction (Fig. 2A). To address this question, we used a series of 70-bp oligonucleotides labeled at one end with a single Atto565 dye and bearing an internal tract of microhomology targeted to a specific region on the pre-synaptic ssDNA. The internal tracts of microhomology were flanked by non-homologous sequences that lacked any microhomology exceeding 7 nt in length (supplemental Table S1). E. coli RecA, S. cerevisiae Rad51, or S. cerevisiae Dmc1 pre-synaptic complexes were assembled onto the ssDNA curtains. The fluorescent dsDNA substrates were then injected into the sample chamber and incubated for 10 min at 30 °C, and the unbound DNA was then flushed away while collecting data. Dissociation rates were then obtained from survival probability analysis of the bound dsDNA fragments (supplemental Fig. S1) (28Lee J.Y. Terakawa T. Qi Z. Steinfeld J.B. Redding S. Kwon Y.

These experiments revealed that extension of the internal tract of microhomology in the 3′ → 5′ direction yielded changes in dissociation rates for RecA, Rad51, and Dmc1, similar to our previously reported results for 5′ → 3′ extension (Fig. 2, B–D) (28Lee J.Y.

In addition, each step coincided with an ∼30% change in relative dissociation rates, corresponding to change in free energy (ΔΔG‡) of ∼0.3 kBT (Fig. 2, B–D). From these results, we concluded that 3′ → 5′ extension of an internal tract of microhomology gave rise to periodic changes in dsDNA dissociation rates for RecA, Rad51, and Dmc1. These findings are consistent with our previous experimental observations using substrates in which we incrementally extended the microhomology length in the 5′ → 3′, as anticipated (28Lee J.Y. Terakawa T. Qi Z. Steinfeld J.B. Redding S. Kwon Y. Gaines W.A. Zhao W. Sung P. Greene E.C. DNA recombination.

We were careful to note that although we obtained similar results for these two sets of substrates, the findings themselves do directly report upon the polarity of strand exchange because we are only assessing the stability of the reaction intermediates after they have already formed. We next asked whether RecA, Rad51, and Dmc1 could discriminate against mismatched bases located within the 5′-terminal triplet of an embedded tract of microhomology. For these assays, a single mismatch was introduced at each of three possible positions at the 5′ end of a 12-nt tract of microhomology (Fig. 3A). These results revealed that a single mismatch at any position within the 5′-terminal triplet abolishes detectable binding of the mismatched triplet by the RecA, Rad51, and Dmc1 (Fig. 3, B–D). These findings are similar to our previous observations for mismatches located at the 3′ end of the internal tract of microhomology (28Lee J.Y. Terakawa T. Qi Z. Steinfeld J.B. Redding S. Kwon Y. Gaines W.A. Zhao W. Sung P. Greene E.C. DNA recombination. Base triplet stepping by the Rad51/RecA family of recombinases.Science. 2015; 349: 977-981Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Taken together, our results support the conclusion that RecA, Rad51, and Dmc1 are all intolerant of single nucleotide mismatches within terminal base triplets located at either the 5′ or 3′ end of an internal tract of sequence homology. RecA and Rad51 can step over mismatches located within the penultimate base triplet near the 3′ end of an internal tract of microhomology, but the reduced stability of the resulting intermediates suggests that the mismatched triplet may remain unpaired (28Lee J.Y. Terakawa T. Qi Z. Steinfeld J.B. Redding S. Kwon Y. Gaines W.A. Zhao W. Sung P. Greene E.C. DNA recombination. Base triplet stepping by the Rad51/RecA family of recombinases.Science. 2015; 349: 977-981Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Dmc1 can also step over internal triplets near the 3′ end of an internal tract of microhomology, but these mismatched triplets still contribute to binding free energy of the resulting intermediate (28Lee J.Y. Terakawa T. Qi Z. Steinfeld J.B. Redding S. Kwon Y. Gaines W.A. Zhao W. Sung P. Greene E.C. DNA recombination. Base triplet stepping by the Rad51/RecA family of recombinases.Science. 2015; 349: 977-981Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). As an extension of these previous findings, we next asked whether RecA, Rad51, and Dmc1 could step over mismatches positioned within the penultimate base triplet near the 5′ end of an internal tract of microhomology (Fig. 3E). Here, a single mismatch was introduced at each of three possible positions within the penultimate base triplet within a 15-nt tract of microhomology (Fig. 3E). For both RecA and Rad51, the binding stability of the resulting intermediate was most consistent with destabilization of the mismatch-bearing base triplet (Fig. 3, F and G). In contrast, the stability of the mismatched intermediates generated by Dmc1 was comparable with the fully paired intermediate (Fig. 3H). We conclude that Dmc1 can stabilize single mismatches located in the penultimate base triplet near either the 5′ or 3′ end of an embedded tract of microhomology. In contrast, RecA and Rad51 were unable to stabilize these mismatched triplets, but both were able to step over the mismatch-bearing triplets to stabilize an adjacent base triplet that is fully homologous to the pre-synaptic ssDNA. To explore the potential mechanism of mismatch stabilization by Dmc1 we next sought to determine whether Dmc1 could stabilize base triplets bearing more than one mismatch. For these assays, we utilized a 70-bp dsDNA substrate bearing a 15-nt tract of microhomology in which the penultimate 3′-triplet harbored either two or three nucleotide mismatches with the pre-synaptic ssDNA (Fig. 4A and supplemental Fig. S2). Consistent with the observation that RecA and Rad51 are intolerant of even a single mismatch, neither protein was capable of stabilizing substrates bearing either two or three mismatches (Fig. 4, B and C, and supplemental Fig. S2). In contrast, Dmc1 was able to stabilize each mismatched substrate such that the relative binding energy of the mismatch-bearing substrates was comparable with the fully paired substrate (Fig. 4B). Interestingly, RecA and Rad51 can both step over triplets bearing single mismatches, but only Rad51 appears to be capable of stepping over triplets bearing either two or three mismatches (Fig. 4, B and C, and supplemental Fig. S2). Based upon the observed changes in binding free energy, RecA appears to be incapable of stabilizing a homologous triplet that lies beyond a triplet bearing either two or three mismatches in reactions using ATPγS. This differential response to substrates harboring multiple mismatches is the only substantive difference we have found between RecA and Rad51 in response to base triplet imperfections. Bulk biochemical assays have revealed that RecA is unable to bypass longer (≥50 bp) heterologous insertions during strand invasion when ATPγS is used as the nucleot"

We studied, in a 2×2×2 factorial design, 576 tail-docked growing-finishing entire male pigs in 64 pens, subjected to low (LSC) vs. high sanitary conditions (HSC), and fed a normal CP (NP) vs. a low CP diet (LP, 80% of NP) ad libitum, with a basal amino acid (AA) profile or supplemented AA profile with extra threonine, tryptophan and methionine. The HSC pigs were vaccinated in the first nine weeks of life and received antibiotics at arrival at experimental farm at ten weeks, after which they were kept in a disinfected part of the farm with a strict hygiene protocol. The LSC pigs were kept on the same farm in non-disinfected pens to which manure from another pig farm was introduced fortnightly. At 15, 18, and 24 weeks of age, prevalence of tail and ear damage and of tail and ear wounds was scored. At 20 and 23 weeks of age, frequencies of biting behaviour and aggression were scored for 10×10 min per pen per week. The prevalence of ear damage during the finisher phase (47 vs. 32% of pigs, P < 0.0001) and the frequency of ear biting (1.3 vs. 1.2 times per hour, P = 0.03) were increased in LSC compared with HSC pigs. This effect on ear biting was diet dependent, however, the supplemented AA profile reduced ear biting only in LSC pigs by 18% (SC × AA profile, P < 0.01). The prevalence of tail wounds was lower for pigs in LSC (13 ± 0.02) than for pigs in HSC (0.22 ± 0.03) in the grower phase (P < 0.007). Regardless of AA profile or sanitary status, LP pigs showed more ear biting (+20%, P < 0.05), tail biting (+25%, P < 0.10), belly nosing (+152%, P < 0.01), other oral manipulation directed at pen mates (+13%, P < 0.05), and aggression (+30%, P < 0.01) than NP pigs, with no effect on ear or tail damage. In conclusion, both low sanitary conditions and a reduction of dietary protein increase the occurrence of damaging behaviours in pigs and therefore may negatively impact pig welfare. Attention should be paid to the impact of dietary nutrient composition on pig behaviour and welfare, particularly when pigs are kept under suboptimal (sanitary) conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2612122574,"The filamentous fungus Aspergillus nidulans primarily reproduces by forming asexual spores called conidia, the integrity of which is governed by the NF-κB type velvet regulators VosA and VelB. The VosA-VelB hetero-complex regulates the expression of spore-specific structural and regulatory genes during conidiogenesis. Here, we characterize one of the VosA/VelB-activated developmental genes, called vadA, the expression of which in conidia requires activity of both VosA and VelB. VadA (AN5709) is predicted to be a 532-amino acid length fungal-specific protein with a highly conserved domain of unknown function (DUF) at the N-terminus. This DUF was found to be conserved in many Ascomycota and some Glomeromycota species, suggesting a potential evolutionarily conserved function of this domain in fungi. Deletion studies of vadA indicate that VadA is required for proper downregulation of brlA, fksA, and rodA, and for proper expression of tpsA and orlA during sporogenesis. Moreover, vadA null mutant conidia exhibit decreased trehalose content, but increased β(1,3)-glucan levels, lower viability, and reduced tolerance to oxidative stress. We further demonstrate that the vadA null mutant shows increased production of the mycotoxin sterigmatocystin. In summary, VadA is a dual-function novel regulator that controls development and secondary metabolism, and participates in bridging differentiation and viability of newly formed conidia in A. nidulans."
https://openalex.org/W2614036739,"One prominent event associated with colorectal adenoma-to-carcinoma progression is genomic instability. Approximately 85% of colorectal cancer cases exhibit chromosomal instability characterized by accumulation of chromosome copy number aberrations (CNAs). Adenomas with gain of chromosome 8q, 13q, and/or 20q are at high risk of progression to cancer. Tumor progression is also associated with expansion of the extracellular matrix (ECM) and the activation of non-malignant cells within the tumor stroma. The glycoproteins versican and lumican are overexpressed at the mRNA level in colon carcinomas compared to adenomas, and are associated with the formation of tumor stroma.The aim of this study was to characterize versican and lumican protein expression in tumor progression and investigate their association with CNAs commonly associated with adenoma-to-carcinoma progression.Tissue microarrays were constructed with colon adenomas and carcinomas that were characterized for MSI-status and DNA copy number gains of chromosomes 8q, 13q and 20q. Sections were immunohistochemically stained for lumican and versican. Protein expression levels were evaluated using digitized slides, and scores were finally dichotomized into a positive or negative score per sample.Lumican and versican expression were both observed in neoplastic cells and in the tumor stroma of colon adenomas and carcinomas. Lumican expression was more frequently present in epithelial cells of carcinomas than adenomas (49% versus 18%; P = 0.0001) and in high-risk adenomas and carcinomas combined compared to low-risk adenomas (43% versus 16%; P = 0.005). Versican staining in the tumor stroma was more often present in high-risk adenomas combined with carcinomas compared to low-risk adenomas (57% versus 36%; P = 0.03) and was associated with the presence of gain of 13q (71% versus 44%; P = 0.04).Epithelial lumican and stromal versican protein expression are increased during colorectal adenoma-to-carcinoma progression."

The STROBE tool was applied to all included studies, and each STROBE item was categorized as 'yes' (met criteria), 'no' (did not meet criteria) or 'not applicable'. The 'Completeness of reporting (COR) score' for each manuscript was calculated: COR score = yes / [yes + no]. In journals with included studies the instructions to authors and reviewers were checked for reference to STROBE.The 89 included studies were undertaken in 32 countries and published in 37 journals. The mean COR score was 60.9% (95% confidence interval [CI] 58.1-63.7%; range 30.8-88.9%). The mean COR score did not differ between surveys published in journals with author instructions referring to STROBE (10/37 journals; 61.1%, 95%CI 56.4-65.8%) or in journals where STROBE was not mentioned (60.9%, 95%CI 57.4-64.3%; p = 0.93).While reporting in blindness prevalence surveys is strong in some areas, others need improvement.

https://openalex.org/W2612843263,"Predicting responses of coastal ecosystems to altered sea surface temperatures (SST) associated with global climate change, requires knowledge of demographic responses of individual species. Body size is an excellent metric because it scales strongly with growth and fecundity for many ectotherms. These attributes can underpin demographic as well as community and ecosystem level processes, providing valuable insights for responses of vulnerable coastal ecosystems to changing climate. We investigated contemporary macroscale patterns in body size among widely distributed crustaceans that comprise the majority of intertidal abundance and biomass of sandy beach ecosystems of the eastern Pacific coasts of Chile and California, USA. We focused on ecologically important species representing different tidal zones, trophic guilds and developmental modes, including a high-shore macroalga-consuming talitrid amphipod (Orchestoidea tuberculata), two mid-shore scavenging cirolanid isopods (Excirolana braziliensis and E. hirsuticauda), and a low-shore suspension-feeding hippid crab (Emerita analoga) with an amphitropical distribution. Significant latitudinal patterns in body sizes were observed for all species in Chile (21° - 42°S), with similar but steeper patterns in Emerita analoga, in California (32°- 41°N). Sea surface temperature was a strong predictor of body size (-4% to -35% °C-1) in all species. Beach characteristics were subsidiary predictors of body size. Alterations in ocean temperatures of even a few degrees associated with global climate change are likely to affect body sizes of important intertidal ectotherms, with consequences for population demography, life history, community structure, trophic interactions, food-webs, and indirect effects such as ecosystem function. The consistency of results for body size and temperature across species with different life histories, feeding modes, ecological roles, and microhabitats inhabiting a single widespread coastal ecosystem, and for one species, across hemispheres in this space-for-time substitution, suggests predictions of ecosystem responses to thermal effects of climate change may potentially be generalised, with important implications for coastal conservation."

https://openalex.org/W2611998531,"CUL9 is a member of the cullin family of E3 ubiquitin ligases, and it localizes predominantly in the cytoplasm. Deletion of Cul9 in mice results in increased DNA damage, widespread aneuploidy, spontaneous tumor development, accelerated Eμ-Myc-induced lymphomagenesis and susceptibility to carcinogenesis. CUL9 binds to p53 and causes cell apoptosis when ectopically expressed. Whether the function of CUL9 in maintaining genomic integrity and suppressing tumorigenesis is linked to p53 has not been genetically tested. Here we report that deletion of CUL9 in human cells results in attenuated p21 induction and impaired cellular response to DNA damage. We show that disruption of Cul9-p53 binding in mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs) by a knock-in mutation in Cul9 (Δp53) increases S-phase cell population, accumulates DNA damage during DNA replication and decreases apoptosis to both endogenous and exogenous DNA-damaging agents. The extent of these alterations in Cul9Δp53 MEFs is indistinguishable to those seen in Cul9−/− MEFs and comparable to those seen in p53−/− MEFs. Deletion of CUL9 in p53 null cells does not lead to further increase of DNA damages. Both Cul9−/− and Cul9Δp53 MEFs proliferate faster and undergo spontaneous immortalization while retaining both Arf and p53. These results demonstrate that the functions of CUL9 in regulating cell proliferation and maintaining genomic integrity are mainly mediated by p53, and that CUL9 is a critical p53 activator."

However, the effect of β-lapachone on metastasis of melanoma cells is unclear. In this study, β-lapachone reduced cell viability of metastatic melanoma cancer cell lines B16F10 and B16BL6 through induction of apoptosis via the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. Additionally, flow cytometry results showed that β-lapachone increased DNA content in the G0/G1 phase of the cell cycle. Analysis of the mechanisms of these events indicated that β-lapachone regulated the expression of Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, and Bax, resulting in the activation of caspase-3, -8, -9, and poly-ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP). Moreover, the β-lapachone-administered group showed significantly decreased lung metastasis in the experimental mouse model. In conclusion, our study demonstrates the inhibitory effect of β-lapachone on lung metastasis of melanoma cells and provides a new insight into the role of β-lapachone as a potential antitumor agent."

At low salt, single myoVc motors can, however, move processively on actin bundles, and at physiologic ionic strength, even teams of myoVc motors require actin bundles to sustain continuous motion. Here, we linked defined numbers of myoVc or myoVa molecules to DNA nanostructures as synthetic cargos. Using total internal reflectance fluorescence microscopy, we compared the stepping behavior of myoVc versus myoVa ensembles and myoVc stepping patterns on single actin filaments versus actin bundles. Run lengths of both myoVc and myoVa teams increased with motor number, but only multiple myoVc motors showed a run-length enhancement on actin bundles compared with actin filaments. By resolving the stepping behavior of individual myoVc motors with a quantum dot bound to the motor domain, we found that coupling of two myoVc motors significantly decreased the futile back and side steps that were frequently observed for single myoVc motors. Changes in the inter-motor distance between two coupled myoVc motors affected stepping dynamics, suggesting that mechanical tension coordinates the stepping behavior of two myoVc motors for efficient directional motion.

https://openalex.org/W2610911688,"Septins are filament-forming GTP-binding proteins involved in many essential cellular events related to cytoskeletal dynamics and maintenance. Septins can self-assemble into heterocomplexes, which polymerize into highly organized, cell membrane-interacting filaments. The number of septin genes varies among organisms, and although their structure and function have been thoroughly studied in opisthokonts (including animals and fungi), no structural studies have been reported for other organisms. This makes the single septin from Chlamydomonas (CrSEPT) a particularly attractive model for investigating whether functional homopolymeric septin filaments also exist. CrSEPT was detected at the base of the flagella in Chlamydomonas, suggesting that CrSEPT is involved in the formation of a membrane-diffusion barrier. Using transmission electron microscopy, we observed that recombinant CrSEPT forms long filaments with dimensions comparable with those of the canonical structure described for opisthokonts. The GTP-binding domain of CrSEPT purified as a nucleotide-free monomer that hydrolyzes GTP and readily binds its analog guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate. We also found that upon nucleotide binding, CrSEPT formed dimers that were stabilized by an interface involving the ligand (G-interface). Across this interface, one monomer supplied a catalytic arginine to the opposing subunit, greatly accelerating the rate of GTP hydrolysis. This is the first report of an arginine finger observed in a septin and suggests that CrSEPT may act as its own GTP-activating protein. The finger is conserved in all algal septin sequences, suggesting a possible correlation between the ability to form homopolymeric filaments and the accelerated rate of hydrolysis that it provides."

Since size and density might have important consequences on reproduction, and therefore natural re-seeding, we monitored adult size, density and potential fecundity of the keyhole limpet (Fissurella latimarginata) and the red sea urchin (Loxechinus albus) in areas under two fishing regimes (TURFs and Open Access Areas, OAAs). Analyzing the distribution of suitable habitats, we predict spatial patterns of potential egg production, to identify reproductive hotspots along the central coast of Chile. The current system of TURFs in central Chile showed higher potential egg production of F. latimarginata and of L. albus than expected under a complete OAAs scenario (67 and 52% respectively). Potential egg production showed more than a twofold reduction when the complete TURFs scenario was compared against complete OAAs condition in both species. Individual size and density explained between 60% and 100% of the variability in potential egg production, suggesting the importance of the enhancement of both biological variables in TURFs in Chile. Potential egg production for both species in the northern part of the studied domain was higher due to the combined effect of (a) suitable habitat and (b) concentration of TURFs. Our results suggest that partially protected areas, such as TURFs can significantly enhance the production of propagules that could seed exploited areas."

Schrenkiana is a long existing problem troubling scientists. The autotoxicity of 3,4-dihydroxy-acetophenone (DHAP) was found to be a causative factor causing the failure of P. Schrenkiana natural regeneration. The effects of concentrations of DHAP treatment on the viability of root cell, activities of antioxidant enzymes and levels of P. Schrenkiana phytohormones were performed to disclose the physiological mechanism of DHAP autotoxicity. It was observed that high concentration of DHAP could inhibit the seed germination and seedling growth, but had a hormesis at low concentrations. Analyses showed that the root cells significantly lost their viability treated with high DHAP. The enzymes activities of seedlings were significantly stimulated by the treatment of 0.5 mM DHAP to give a transient increase and then decrease as DHAP concentration increased to 1.0 mM except for GR (glutathione reductase) in which DHAP treatment had little effect on its activity. Comparing with the control, an increase in the levels of phytohormones ZT (zeatin), GA3 (gibberellic acid) and IAA (indole acetic acid) was induced by the treatment of DHAP at low concentrations (0.1-0.25 mM), but the significant deficiency was found treated by high concentrations (0.5-1.0 mM). In addition, the ABA (abscisic acid) level increased in all experimental observations. These results suggested that DHAP significantly affected indices of growth and physiology, and provided some new information about different effect in P. Schrenkiana treated with DHAP."

https://openalex.org/W2612753005,"Higher HIV diversity has been associated with virologic outcomes in children on antiretroviral treatment (ART). We examined the association of HIV diversity with virologic outcomes in adults from the HPTN 052 trial who initiated ART at CD4 cell counts of 350–550 cells/mm3. A high resolution melting (HRM) assay was used to analyze baseline (pre-treatment) HIV diversity in six regions in the HIV genome (two in gag, one in pol, and three in env) from 95 participants who failed ART. We analyzed the association of HIV diversity in each genomic region with baseline (pre-treatment) factors and three clinical outcomes: time to virologic suppression after ART initiation, time to ART failure, and emergence of HIV drug resistance at ART failure. After correcting for multiple comparisons, we did not find any association of baseline HIV diversity with demographic, laboratory, or clinical characteristics. For the 18 analyses performed for clinical outcomes evaluated, there was only one significant association: higher baseline HIV diversity in one of the three HIV env regions was associated with longer time to ART failure (p = 0.008). The HRM diversity assay may be useful in future studies exploring the relationship between HIV diversity and clinical outcomes in individuals with HIV infection."
