https://openalex.org/W1487365829,"The regulation of the Ca(2+)- and phorbol ester-insensitive zeta isozyme of protein kinase C (PKC zeta) by phospholipids was studied. Phosphatidylserine (PS) stimulated the activity to the same extent as proteolysis by calpain. However, the PS stimulation was abolished by phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) or phosphatidylcholine. Phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-P3 (PIP3) produced a large stimulation of PKC zeta in the absence or presence of PS plus PE that was equal to that seen with PS alone. In the presence of PS plus PE, PIP3 was half-maximally effective at 50 nM. Phosphatidylinositol-3,4-P2 also fully activated PKC zeta, but higher concentrations (0.5 microM) of phosphatidylinositol-3-P, phosphatidylinositol-4-P, and phosphatidylinositol-4,5-P2 produced only partial (11-30%) activation of the enzyme. In contrast, when tested with conventional PKC purified from rat brain, none of the inositol phospholipids produced more than one-third of the stimulation seen with PS plus Ca2+ plus phorbol ester, and there was little difference between the efficacy of PIP3 and that of the other phospholipids. PIP3 produced a marked stimulation of the autophosphorylation of PKC zeta, indicating that it interacted with the enzyme directly. These results suggest that PKC zeta may be a target for PIP3 and thus may be involved in the signaling mechanism(s) for growth factors and oncogenes that increase phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activity."

The crystal structure of a complex containing the five Zn fingers from the human GLI oncogene and a high-affinity DNA binding site has been determined at 2.6 Ã… resolution. Finger one does not contact the DNA. Fingers two through five bind in the major groove and wrap around the DNA, but lack the simple, strictly periodic arrangement observed in the Zif268 complex. Fingers four and five of GLI make extensive base contacts in a conserved nine base-pair region, and this section of the DNA has a conformation intermediate between B-DNA and A-DNA. Analyzing the GLI complex and comparing it with Zif268 offers new perspectives on Zn finger-DNA recognition."
https://openalex.org/W2020317622,"Rheumatoid arthritis is an inflammatory synovial disease thought to involve T cells reacting to an antigen within the joint. Type II collagen is the major protein in articular cartilage and is a potential autoantigen in this disease. Oral tolerization to autoantigens suppresses animal models of T cell-mediated autoimmune disease, including two models of rheumatoid arthritis. In this randomized, double-blind trial involving 60 patients with severe, active rheumatoid arthritis, a decrease in the number of swollen joints and tender joints occurred in subjects fed chicken type II collagen for 3 months but not in those that received a placebo. Four patients in the collagen group had complete remission of the disease. No side effects were evident. These data demonstrate clinical efficacy of an oral tolerization approach for rheumatoid arthritis."
https://openalex.org/W2006714198,"A combination of computational methods has been used to evaluate the interaction between the pi face of a benzene molecule and the monovalent cations of lithium, sodium, potassium, and rubidium. In the gas phase, the ions are strongly bound, and the affinity for benzene follows the expected electrostatic trend (lithium, largest; rubidium, smallest). However, in an aqueous environment, a reordering occurs such that the potassium ion is preferred over all the other ions for 2:1 benzene:ion complexes. The selectivity sequence parallels that seen in voltage-gated potassium channels. Given that several conserved aromatic residues are present in the pore region of such channels, these results suggest that the cation-pi interaction may be responsible for the ion selectivity in potassium channels."
https://openalex.org/W1981101169,"Interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha) and IFN-gamma regulate gene expression by tyrosine phosphorylation of several transcription factors that have the 91-kilodalton (p91) protein of interferon-stimulated gene factor-3 (ISGF-3) as a common component. Interferon-activated protein complexes bind enhancers present in the promoters of early response genes such as the high-affinity Fc gamma receptor gene (Fc gamma RI). Treatment of human peripheral blood monocytes or basophils with interleukin-3 (IL-3), IL-5, IL-10, or granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) activated DNA binding proteins that recognized the IFN-gamma response region (GRR) located in the promoter of the Fc gamma RI gene. Although tyrosine phosphorylation was required for the assembly of each of these GRR binding complexes, only those formed as a result of treatment with IFN-gamma or IL-10 contained p91. Instead, complexes activated by IL-3 or GM-CSF contained a tyrosine-phosphorylated protein of 80 kilodaltons. Induction of Fc gamma RI RNA occurred only with IFN-gamma and IL-10, whereas pretreatment of cells with GM-CSF or IL-3 inhibited IFN-gamma induction of Fc gamma RI RNA. Thus, several cytokines other than interferons can activate putative transcription factors by tyrosine phosphorylation."
https://openalex.org/W1573387643,"Continuous exposure of cells to hormonal agonists often causes a rapid waning of the stimulated response. This desensitization effect has been extensively studied in the beta-adrenergic receptor system, and attributed largely to the rapid phosphorylation of the receptor by two kinases. Over a similar time frame (seconds to minutes), agonists also trigger a selective loss in the capacity of receptors to bind hydrophilic but not hydrophobic ligands, a phenomenon termed sequestration. There is some evidence suggesting that sequestration represents the rapid internalization of receptors, but the functional significance of sequestration has remained unclear. Upon the removal of agonist, both desensitization and sequestration are readily reversed with similar kinetics (t1/2 approximately 3 min for both). To investigate the possibility that receptor sequestration is involved in this resensitization of the adenylyl cyclase response, we applied two distinct approaches to block receptor sequestration: by pretreating cells with sucrose and by creating a sequestration-defective beta 2-adrenergic receptor by site-specific mutagenesis. Both approaches effectively disabled receptor sequestration, with little effect on adenylyl cyclase stimulation or on desensitization. However, in both cases, no recovery from desensitization was apparent even 20 min after the removal of agonist. Similarly, pretreating cells with concanavalin A almost completely blocked receptor sequestration and resensitization but only partially inhibited other receptor functions. Our results therefore suggest that sequestration of beta 2-adrenergic receptors is a mechanism involved in reactivating and recycling desensitized receptors."
https://openalex.org/W1997935194,"Interferons induce transcriptional activation through tyrosine phosphorylation of the latent, cytoplasmic transcription factor interferon-stimulated gene factor-3 (ISGF-3). Growth factors and cytokines were found to use a similar pathway: The 91-kilodalton subunit of ISGF-3 was activated and tyrosine phosphorylated in response to epidermal growth factor (EGF), platelet-derived growth factor, and colony stimulating factor-1. The tyrosine phosphorylated factor acquired DNA binding activity and accumulated in nuclei. Activation required the major sites for autophosphorylation on the EGF receptor that bind Src homology region 2 domain-containing proteins implicated in Ras activation. However, activation of this factor was independent of the normal functioning of Ras."
https://openalex.org/W2030828553,"Intraperitoneal injection of epidermal growth factor (EGF) into mice resulted in the appearance in liver nuclei of three tyrosine phosphorylated proteins (84, 91, and 92 kilodaltons) within minutes after administration of EGF. Administration of interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) resulted in the appearance in liver nuclei of two tyrosine phosphorylated proteins (84 and 91 kilodaltons). The 84- and 91-kilodalton proteins detected after either EGF or IFN-gamma administration were identified as the IFN-gamma activation factors (GAF). Furthermore, gel shift analysis revealed that these GAF proteins, detected after either EGF or IFN-gamma administration, specifically bound to the sis-inducible element of the c-fos promoter. Thus, GAF proteins participate in nuclear signaling in both IFN-gamma and EGF pathways."
https://openalex.org/W1511779378,"Superoxide dismutase (SOD) has been championed as an effective antioxidant for the treatment of ischemia-reperfusion injury in a wide variety of tissues. Unfortunately a bell-shaped dose-response curve has been observed, whereby SOD at higher concentrations loses its effectiveness and may even enhance the extent of reperfusion injury. Using the xanthine/xanthine oxidase reaction to generate superoxide radicals, we have attempted to examine the role of the Fenton reaction in SOD toxicity observing that high SOD levels along with micromolar concentrations of Fe2+ greatly increased the production of the highly toxic hydroxyl radical. The production of superoxide radicals and their conversion to hydroxyl radicals were measured by using the spin-trapping agent 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline-N-oxide (DMPO) and electron spin resonance (ESR). Attempts to counter the toxicity of SOD involved the covalent conjugation of SOD to catalase in an effort to lower the available free H2O2 and thus minimize the extent of the Fenton reaction. The conjugate was tested in both the xanthine/xanthine oxidase system and a rat heart model of ischemia-reperfusion. In the xanthine/xanthine oxidase model, the combination of SOD and Fe2+ results in an enhanced production of hydroxyl radicals which is inhibited by the inclusion of catalase. In reperfused ischemic hearts, working at levels of free SOD which were either toxic or failed to give any protection against reperfusion injury, an equivalent amount of SOD conjugated to catalase resulted in an 80% return to normal mechanical function of the reperfused hearts. We attribute the toxicity of free SOD in hearts subjected to ischemia-reperfusion injury to the production of hydroxyl radicals as a result of the increased Fenton reaction. This reaction is inhibited by the presence of catalase conjugated to SOD."

The zirconocene unit stabilizes highly strained alkynes and alkenes, allowing their use in selective carbon-carbon bond-forming reactions. This unit also increases the reactivity of unactivated molecules, enabling them to participate in nontraditional transformations. A general route has been developed that allows a wider variety of unsaturated fragments to participate in these reactions. The use of these zirconocene complexes in organic synthesis has led to the development of novel routes to a number of polyfunctionalized organic molecules."
https://openalex.org/W1603470245,"Methylprednisolone stimulates rabbit ileal neutral NaCl absorption; and aminoglutethimide, which decreases glucocorticoid levels, decreases NaCl absorption. Studies were carried out to determine the mechanism of these effects and to determine which members of the gene family of mammalian Na+/H+ exchangers were involved. Rabbits were treated subcutaneously with methylprednisolone (40 mg daily for 24 or 72 h), aminoglutethimide (100 mg twice daily for 72 h), or saline as a control. Ileal brush border membranes were prepared by magnesium precipitation, and brush border Na+/H+ exchange was determined by 22Na+ uptake over 3-8 s. The 22Na+ uptake experiments were performed in the presence of a voltage clamp using either valinomycin/potassium or tetramethylammonium/nitrate to eliminate potential contributions by other electrogenic transport processes. Methylprednisolone treatment approximately doubled ileal brush border Na+/H+ exchange, whereas aminoglutethimide led to a 50% decrease in Na+/H+ exchange. These effects were specifically on Na+ uptake with an acid inside pH gradient, whereas diffusive Na+ uptake (no pH gradient), glucose-dependent Na+ uptake, and glucose and Na+ equilibrium volumes were not affected. To determine if the increase in Na+/H+ exchange was associated with an increase in message expression, mRNA levels were measured by ribonuclease protection assay. Methylprednisolone stimulated the NHE-3 mRNA level by 4-6-fold at 24 h, which remained increased at 72 h. In contrast, messages for NHE-1 and NHE-2 were not affected by methylprednisolone. In summary, 1) methylprednisolone stimulation of rabbit ileal Na+ absorption is due to stimulation of ileal villus cell brush border Na+/H+ exchange; 2) basal ileal brush border Na+/H+ exchange is dependent on glucocorticoid levels; and 3) an increase in NHE-3 message, but not in NHE-1 or NHE-2 message, correlates with the stimulation of ileal brush border Na+/H+ exchange. It is likely that NHE-3 is an Na+/H+ exchanger that is involved in ileal Na+ absorption."
https://openalex.org/W1497873494,"It has been demonstrated that okadaic acid-insensitive protein phosphatases are involved in dephosphorylation of autophosphorylated Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaM kinase II) in rat cerebellar granule cells (Fukunaga, K., Rich, D. P., and Soderling, T. R. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 21830-21836). In the present study, recombinant rat protein phosphatase 2C (PrP-2C) expressed in Escherichia coli could dephosphorylate both Thr286/287 and Thr305/306 phosphorylation sites of CaM kinase II, which are responsible for the generation of Ca(2+)-independent activity and the inhibition of the total activity, respectively. The dephosphorylation of Thr286/287 and Thr305/306 was accomplished within 15 min at 0 degrees C and totally dependent on Mg2+. Phosphopeptide mapping of the CNBr-cleaved 32P-labeled CaM kinase II revealed that PrP-2C was relatively specific for dephosphorylation of Thr286/287 and Thr305/306 in the autophosphorylated CaM kinase II. These results suggest that PrP-2C has a role in the regulation of the Ca(2+)-independent activity of CaM kinase II in the neural cells."
https://openalex.org/W1503015570,"We have investigated the phosphorylation of HSP27, a 27-kDa heat shock protein which is involved in cellular thermoresistance and is also an early target of phosphorylation during heat shock and cell stimulation by a variety of growth and differentiation factors. HSP27 is transiently phosphorylated after shifting Chinese hamster cells from their normal temperature of 37 to 44 degrees C. The phosphorylation correlated in time with the transient activation of specific HSP27 protein kinase activities. HSP27 kinase was also induced to maximal levels within 5-15 min following stimulation of quiescent cells with heat shock, serum, thrombin, or basic fibroblast growth factor. Extracts from quiescent cells stimulated by heat shock or serum were analyzed after sequential chromatography on cation exchange and hydroxylapatite columns. In both cases, a single and identical peak of HSP27 kinase activity was obtained, suggesting that the same protein kinase was induced. The HSP27 kinase efficiently phosphorylated recombinant Chinese hamster HSP27 or the synthetic peptide RALNRQLSSGV containing the major in vivo phosphorylation site of rodent HSP27. The kinase was inactive toward the ribosomal S6 protein, the peptide RALSSLRA from S6 protein, or the mutant HSP27 proteins with in vivo phosphorylation sites altered to glycine. The partially purified HSP27 kinase had no kinase C, kinase A, or S6 kinase activities; conversely, HSP27 was not a good substrate for these kinases. HSP27 kinase was rapidly inactivated in the presence of acid phosphatase, suggesting that its activity was regulated by phosphorylation. It is suggested that this heat shock- and serum-induced HSP27 kinase is a novel serine kinase which is linked to a major signal transduction cascade."
https://openalex.org/W1552536865,"Dihydrotachysterol (DHT), a reduced vitamin D analog in which the A-ring has been rotated through 180 degrees is a biologically active molecule which can be used to study the structural requirements for the calcemic and cell differentiating properties of the vitamin D hormone, 1 alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1 alpha,25-(OH)2D3), as well as to investigate the specificity of the enzyme systems that catalyze the formation of this hormone. In this study we showed that dihydrotachysterol was metabolized in vivo into a significant polar metabolite observed on straight-phase high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) which subsequently split into two peaks on reverse-phase HPLC. These two metabolites were identified by HPLC and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry techniques as 1 alpha,25-(OH)2DHT and 1 beta,25-(OH)2DHT. This pair of metabolites was formed from either DHT2 or DHT3. Standard 1 alpha,25-(OH)2DHTs were generated in vitro from chemically synthesized 1-hydroxydihydrotachysterol precursors using a liver hepatoma cell system. Both 1 alpha,25-(OH)2D2 and 1 alpha,25-(OH)2DHT3 showed a binding affinity to the mammalian vitamin D receptor only 50-100 less than 1 alpha,25-(OH)2D3 whereas 1 beta,25-(OH)2DHTs showed poor binding. On the other hand 1 beta,25-(OH)2DHT3 bound to the rat vitamin D transport protein (DBP) with stronger affinity than did 1 alpha,25-(OH)2DHT3. When tested in a COS-1 cell transfection assay system using a rat osteocalcin vitamin D responsive element coupled to a growth hormone reporter gene, 1 alpha,25-(OH)2DHT3 showed a biological activity only 10 times lower than 1 alpha,25-(OH)2D3. It is therefore suggested that 1 alpha,25-(OH)2DHT probably represents the metabolite of DHT responsible for some of its in vivo effects although we cannot rule out in vivo effects of other metabolites identified. Our studies suggest that 1 alpha,25-dihydroxylated DHTs represent a promising novel group of vitamin D analogs worthy of study for cell differentiation as well as calcemic properties."
https://openalex.org/W2127570182,"The multienzyme carbon monoxide dehydrogenase complex from Methanosarcina thermophila contains at least two protein components: a CO-oxidizing nickel/iron-sulfur (Ni/Fe-S) component and a cobalt-containing corrinoid/iron-sulfur component (Co/Fe-S). The CO dehydrogenase complex has been shown to synthesize acetyl-CoA from CoA, CH3I, and CO as well as to cleave acetyl-CoA into its methyl, carbonyl, and CoA components as the first step in the catabolism of acetyl-CoA to methane and CO2. Presumed to serve as an acceptor of the methyl group of acetyl-CoA en route to methane, the Co/Fe-S component contains iron, acid-labile sulfur, and a corrinoid cofactor (factor III) that is the site of methylation. Using EPR spectroscopy and spectroelectrochemistry, we characterized the cobalt and Fe-S centers of the Co/Fe-S component. The redox and EPR properties of the metal centers in the isolated Co/Fe-S component are similar to those of the Co/Fe-S component in the CO dehydrogenase enzyme complex, a result that indicates that any protein-protein interaction between components in the complex has little influence on the properties of the metal centers. The corrinoid is maintained in the base-off state with a formal equilibrium reduction potential (E'o) at pH 7.8 of -486 mV for the Co2+/1+ couple that facilitates reduction of the Co2+ state by approximately 12 kcal/mol relative to base-on cobamides. The Co/Fe-S component also contains a [4Fe-4S]2+/1+ cluster with an E'o at pH 7.8 of -502 mV, which is nearly isopotential with the Co2+/1+ couple of the cobamide."

https://openalex.org/W1532095987,"Abstract The reductive half-reaction of xanthine oxidase with substoichiometric concentrations of xanthine and 1-methylxanthine at pH 10 and 8.5 has been examined by UV-visible stopped-flow and rapid-quench electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) kinetic experiments. A spectral intermediate is observed in stopped-flow experiments with xanthine which exhibits a difference absorbance maximum relative to oxidized enzyme at 480 nm and which decays at the same rate as the decay of the MoV EPR signal observed by freeze-quench EPR experiments both at 5 and 20 degrees C. The intermediate is observed in experiments using enzyme that has had its flavin removed, and most likely arises from the molybdenum center. With 40 microM xanthine oxidase and 10 microM xanthine, rate constants for the appearance and decay of this intermediate at pH 10 are 11 and 1.1 s-1, respectively; at pH 8.5 the corresponding values are 20 and 2.5 s-1. Based on the correlation of the stopped-flow kinetics with the appearance and decay of the MoV EPR signal designated very as monitored in freeze-quench experiments, it is concluded that the spectral intermediate corresponds to the species exhibiting the very EPR signal, the MoIV species that gives rise to it, or a combination of the two. None of the MoV EPR signals designated rapid is observed under single turnover conditions with either xanthine or 1-methylxanthine as substrate at pH 8.5, by contrast with the substantial amounts observed in both cases under conditions of excess substrate. These results call into question the prevailing view that the species giving rise to the EPR signal lies downstream in the catalytic cycle from that exhibiting the very signal."

https://openalex.org/W1548525708,"Proteolytic removal and genetic deletion of the amino-terminal domain of G protein alpha subunit have shown that this region is necessary for interaction with beta gamma subunits. In the alpha subunits which undergo myristoylation, myristoylation of the amino-terminal glycine modulates the affinity of alpha subunit for the beta gamma complex. To determine the role of the same glycine in nonmyristoylated alpha subunits, we substituted it for alanine in Gs alpha and characterized the properties of the mutated chain G2A Gs alpha. The mutant could still bind guanosine 5'-(3-O-thio)triphosphate (GTP gamma S) as revealed by its resistance to trypsin proteolysis and was able to interact with the membrane. However, G2A Gs alpha was a poor substrate for cholera toxin-catalyzed ADP-ribosylation either in the soluble form or when membrane-associated. Addition of beta gamma subunits increased the sedimentation rate of G2A Gs alpha in sucrose gradients. Binding experiments performed on cyc- membranes reconstituted by G2A Gs alpha showed that the GTP-induced shift of isoproterenol affinity for the beta-adrenergic receptors was reduced. On the same membranes, isoproterenol, GTP gamma S and NaF were 2-fold less effective for activating adenylylcyclase when compared to cyc- membranes reconstituted by Gs alpha. This differential stimulation of adenylylcyclase was not due to an affinity change for the effector but to a decrease in the maximal activation. Thus the G2A substitution affected beta gamma-dependent properties on reconstituted membranes such as receptor coupling and cholera toxin-catalyzed ADP-ribosylation and we propose that the decreased activation of adenylylcyclase might result from the same defect. Although not essential for association with beta gamma subunits, the amino-terminal glycine of nonmyristoylated Gs alpha might play a modulatory role in this interaction."

https://openalex.org/W2125375985,"Abstract A mouse leukemia L1210 cell line was selected for resistance to deoxyguanosine. The deoxyguanosine-resistant cells (dGuo-R) were 126-fold less sensitive to deoxyguanosine than the wild-type cells. The IC50 values for araC and araG were increased, but only 10-12-fold in the dGuo-R cells when compared with the wild-type cells. The dGuo-R cell line showed an increased level of resistance to 2-fluoro-2'-deoxyadenosine and 2-fluoroadenine arabinoside (11-14-fold), but essentially no increase in resistance to deoxyadenosine or adenine arabinoside. Deoxyribonucleoside kinase activity was decreased only slightly (19%) when deoxycytidine was utilized as substrate; when cytosine arabinoside or deoxyguanosine was used as the substrate, the kinase activity in the extracts from the dGuo-R cells was only 10% of the enzyme activity in the extracts from the wild-type cells. The determination of the kinetic parameters, Km and Vmax, indicated that there were marked decreases in the Vmax values for deoxyguanosine and cytosine arabinoside as substrates, but not for deoxycytidine as substrate; the Km values for deoxycytidine and cytosine arabinoside were increased in the extracts from the dGuo-R cells. By use of high-performance liquid chromatography, the kinase activities in the extracts from the wild-type and resistant cells could be resolved. There was the specific loss of kinase activity toward cytosine arabinoside and deoxyguanosine as substrates. These data indicate that the dGuo-R cells have decreased levels of a specific deoxyribonucleoside kinase activity."
