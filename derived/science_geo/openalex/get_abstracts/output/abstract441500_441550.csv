https://openalex.org/W2055654995,"The lysosome is a degradative organelle, and its fusion with other organelles is strictly regulated. In contrast to fusion with the late endosome, the mechanisms underlying autophagosome-lysosome fusion remain unknown. Here, we identify syntaxin 17 (Stx17) as the autophagosomal SNARE required for fusion with the endosome/lysosome. Stx17 localizes to the outer membrane of completed autophagosomes but not to the isolation membrane (unclosed intermediate structures); for this reason, the lysosome does not fuse with the isolation membrane. Stx17 interacts with SNAP-29 and the endosomal/lysosomal SNARE VAMP8. Depletion of Stx17 causes accumulation of autophagosomes without degradation. Stx17 has a unique C-terminal hairpin structure mediated by two tandem transmembrane domains containing glycine zipper-like motifs, which is essential for its association with the autophagosomal membrane. These findings reveal a mechanism by which the SNARE protein is available to the completed autophagosome."

Despite being known for decades (Warburg effect), the molecular mechanisms regulating this switch remained unexplored. Here, we identify SIRT6 as a tumor suppressor that regulates aerobic glycolysis in cancer cells. Importantly, loss of SIRT6 leads to tumor formation without activation of known oncogenes, whereas transformed SIRT6-deficient cells display increased glycolysis and tumor growth, suggesting that SIRT6 plays a role in both establishment and maintenance of cancer. By using a conditional SIRT6 allele, we show that SIRT6 deletion in vivo increases the number, size, and aggressiveness of tumors. SIRT6 also functions as a regulator of ribosome metabolism by corepressing MYC transcriptional activity. Lastly, Sirt6 is selectively downregulated in several human cancers, and expression levels of SIRT6 predict prognosis and tumor-free survival rates, highlighting SIRT6 as a critical modulator of cancer metabolism. Our studies reveal SIRT6 to be a potent tumor suppressor acting to suppress cancer metabolism. Reprogramming of cellular metabolism is a key event during tumorigenesis.

SIRT6 is a tumor suppressor that regulates cancer metabolism SIRT6 can lead to tumor formation even in the absence of oncogene activation SIRT6 levels predict tumor-free survival time in human cancers Inhibition of glycolysis in SIRT6-deficient cells abrogates tumor formation Cancer cells are characterized by the acquisition of several characteristics that enable them to become tumorigenic (Hanahan and Weinberg, 2000Hanahan D. Weinberg R.A. The hallmarks of cancer.Cell. 2000; 100: 57-70Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22350) Google Scholar). Among them, the ability to sustain uncontrolled proliferation represents the most fundamental trait of cancer cells. This hyperproliferative state involves the deregulation of proliferative signaling pathways as well as loss of cell-cycle regulation. In addition, tumor cells need to readjust their energy metabolism to fuel cell growth and division. This metabolic adaptation is directly regulated by many oncogenes and tumor suppressors and is required to support the energetic and anabolic demands associated with cell growth and proliferation (Lunt and Vander Heiden, 2011Lunt S.Y. Vander Heiden M.G. Aerobic glycolysis: meeting the metabolic requirements of cell proliferation.Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2011; 27: 441-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (1853) Google Scholar). Alteration in glucose metabolism is the best-known example of metabolic reprogramming in cancer cells. Under aerobic conditions, normal cells convert glucose to pyruvate through glycolysis, which enters the mitochondria to be further catabolized in the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA) to generate ATP. Under anaerobic conditions, mitochondrial respiration is abated; glucose metabolism is shifted toward glycolytic conversion of pyruvate into lactate. This metabolic reprogramming is also observed in cancer cells, even in the presence of oxygen, and was first described by Otto Warburg several decades ago (Warburg, 1956Warburg O. On the origin of cancer cells.Science. 1956; 123: 309-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (9620) Google Scholar; Warburg et al., 1927Warburg O. Wind F. Negelein E. The metabolism of tumors in the body.J. Gen. Physiol. 1927; 8: 519-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (2534) Google Scholar). By switching their glucose metabolism toward “aerobic glycolysis,” cancer cells accumulate glycolytic intermediates that will be used as building blocks for macromolecular synthesis (Vander Heiden et al., 2009Vander Heiden M.G. Cantley L.C. Thompson C.B. Understanding the Warburg effect: the metabolic requirements of cell proliferation.Science. 2009; 324: 1029-1033Crossref PubMed Scopus (10206) Google Scholar). Most cancer cells exhibit increased glucose uptake, which is due, in part, to the upregulation of glucose transporters, mainly GLUT1 (Yamamoto et al., 1990Yamamoto T. Seino Y. Fukumoto H. Koh G. Yano H. Inagaki N. Yamada Y. Inoue K. Manabe T. Imura H. Over-expression of facilitative glucose transporter genes in human cancer.Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Wide expression of the human erythrocyte glucose transporter Glut1 in human cancers.Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 1164-1167PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, cancer cells display a high expression and activity of several glycolytic enzymes, including phosphofructokinase (PFK)-1, pyruvate kinase M2, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)-A, and pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK)-1 (Lunt and Vander Heiden, 2011Lunt S.Y. Vander Heiden M.G. Aerobic glycolysis: meeting the metabolic requirements of cell proliferation.Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2011; 27: 441-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (1853) Google Scholar), leading to the high rate of glucose catabolism and lactate production characteristic of these cells. Importantly, downregulation of either LDH-A or PDK1 decreases tumor growth (Bonnet et al., 2007Bonnet S. Archer S.L. Allalunis-Turner J. Haromy A. Beaulieu C. Thompson R. Lee C.T. Lopaschuk G.D.

Inhibition of lactate dehydrogenase A induces oxidative stress and inhibits tumor progression.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2010; 107: 2037-2042Crossref PubMed Scopus (1014) Google Scholar), suggesting an important role for these proteins in the metabolic reprogramming of cancer cells. Traditionally, cancer-associated alterations in metabolism have been considered a secondary response to cell proliferation signals. However, growing evidence has demonstrated that metabolic reprogramming of cancer cells is a primary function of activated oncogenes and inactivated tumor suppressors (Dang, 2012Dang C.V. MYC on the path to cancer.Cell. 2012; 149: 22-35Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2128) Google Scholar; DeBerardinis et al., 2008DeBerardinis R.J. Lum J.J. Hatzivassiliou G.

Thompson C.B. Metabolic reprogramming: a cancer hallmark even Warburg did not anticipate.Cancer Cell. 2012; 21: 297-308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2191) Google Scholar). Despite this evidence, whether the metabolic reprogramming observed in cancer cells is a driving force for tumorigenesis remains as yet poorly understood. Sirtuins are a family of NAD+-dependent protein deacetylases involved in stress resistance and metabolic homeostasis (Finkel et al., 2009Finkel T. Deng C.X. Mostoslavsky R. Recent progress in the biology and physiology of sirtuins.Nature. 2009; 460: 587-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (1191) Google Scholar). In mammals, there are seven members of this family (SIRT1–7). SIRT6 is a chromatin-bound factor that was first described as a suppressor of genomic instability (Mostoslavsky et al., 2006Mostoslavsky R. Chua K.F. Lombard D.B. Pang W.W. Fischer M.R. Gellon L. Liu P. Mostoslavsky G. Franco S. Murphy M.M. et al.Genomic instability and aging-like phenotype in the absence of mammalian SIRT6.Cell. 2006; 124: 315-329Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1232) Google Scholar). SIRT6 also localizes to telomeres in human cells and controls cellular senescence and telomere structure by deacetylating histone H3 lysine 9 (H3K9) (Michishita et al., 2008Michishita E. McCord R.A. Berber E. Kioi M. Padilla-Nash H. Damian M. Cheung P. Kusumoto R. Kawahara T.L. Barrett J.C. et al.SIRT6 is a histone H3 lysine 9 deacetylase that modulates telomeric chromatin.Nature. 2008; 452: 492-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (846) Google Scholar). However, the main phenotype that SIRT6-deficient mice display is an acute and severe metabolic abnormality. At 20 days of age, they develop a degenerative phenotype that includes complete loss of subcutaneous fat, lymphopenia, osteopenia, and acute onset of hypoglycemia, leading to death in less than 10 days (Mostoslavsky et al., 2006Mostoslavsky R. Chua K.F. Lombard D.B. Pang W.W. Fischer M.R. Gellon L. Liu P. Mostoslavsky G. Franco S. Murphy M.M. et al.Genomic instability and aging-like phenotype in the absence of mammalian SIRT6.Cell. 2006; 124: 315-329Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1232) Google Scholar). Recently, we have demonstrated that the lethal hypoglycemia exhibited by SIRT6-deficient mice is caused by an increased glucose uptake in muscle and brown adipose tissue (Zhong et al., 2010Zhong L. D'Urso A. Toiber D. Sebastian C. Henry R.E. Vadysirisack D.D. Guimaraes A. Marinelli B. Wikstrom J.D. Nir T. et al.The histone deacetylase Sirt6 regulates glucose homeostasis via Hif1alpha.Cell. 2010; 140: 280-293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (788) Google Scholar). Specifically, SIRT6 corepresses HIF-1α by deacetylating H3K9 at the promoters of several glycolytic genes, and consequently, SIRT6-deficient cells exhibit increased glucose uptake and upregulated glycolysis even under normoxic conditions (Zhong et al., 2010Zhong L. D'Urso A. Toiber D. Sebastian C. Henry R.E. Vadysirisack D.D. Guimaraes A. Marinelli B. Wikstrom J.D. Nir T. et al.The histone deacetylase Sirt6 regulates glucose homeostasis via Hif1alpha.Cell. 2010; 140: 280-293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (788) Google Scholar). Such a phenotype, reminiscent of the “Warburg effect” in tumor cells, prompted us to investigate whether SIRT6 may protect against tumorigenesis by inhibiting glycolytic metabolism. Here, we demonstrate that SIRT6 is a tumor suppressor that regulates aerobic glycolysis in cancer cells. Strikingly, SIRT6 acts as a first-hit tumor suppressor, and lack of this chromatin factor leads to tumor formation even in nontransformed cells. Notably, inhibition of glycolysis in SIRT6-deficient cells completely rescues their tumorigenic potential, suggesting that enhanced glycolysis is the driving force for tumorigenesis in these cells. Furthermore, we provide data demonstrating that SIRT6 regulates cell proliferation by acting as a corepressor of c-Myc, inhibiting the expression of ribosomal genes. Finally, SIRT6 expression is downregulated in human cancers, strongly reinforcing the idea that SIRT6 is a tumor suppressor. We have previously shown that SIRT6 protects from genomic instability (Mostoslavsky et al., 2006Mostoslavsky R. Chua K.F. Lombard D.B. Pang W.W. Fischer M.R. Gellon L. Liu P. Mostoslavsky G. Franco S. Murphy M.M. et al.Genomic instability and aging-like phenotype in the absence of mammalian SIRT6.Cell. 2006; 124: 315-329Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1232) Google Scholar) and regulates aerobic glycolysis (Zhong et al., 2010Zhong L. D'Urso A. Toiber D. Sebastian C. Henry R.E. Vadysirisack D.D. Guimaraes A. Marinelli B. Wikstrom J.D. Nir T. et al.The histone deacetylase Sirt6 regulates glucose homeostasis via Hif1alpha.Cell. 2010; 140: 280-293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (788) Google Scholar), key features of cancer cells. Therefore, we hypothesized that SIRT6 deficiency could lead to tumorigenesis. To study this possibility, we obtained mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) from Sirt6 wild-type (WT) and knockout (KO) embryos and immortalized them by using a standard 3T3 protocol. We found that Sirt6 KO MEFs showed increased proliferation (Figure 1A) and formed larger colonies when plated at very low density, compared to Sirt6 WT cells (Figure 1B), indicating that SIRT6 deficiency confers a growth advantage. Next, we injected Sirt6 WT and KO MEFs into the flanks of SCID mice to assess the ability of these cells to form tumors in vivo. Immortalized MEFs never develop tumors in this setting unless they are transformed with an activated oncogene, such as Ras or Myc (“second hit”). Strikingly, Sirt6 KO MEFs readily formed tumors (Figure 1C), indicating that SIRT6 deficiency is sufficient to induce transformation of immortalized MEFs. To confirm that this was not due to nonspecific effects of the immortalization process, we immortalized Sirt6 WT and KO MEFs by knocking down p53 in passage 3 primary MEFs (Figure S1A available online). Again, Sirt6 KO MEFs showed increased proliferation (Figure S1B) and were able to form tumors when injected into SCID mice (Figure S1C). Together, these results suggest that SIRT6 acts as a tumor suppressor and, upon loss of cell-cycle checkpoint control, SIRT6 deficiency can lead to tumorigenesis in mice.Figure S1Sirt6 KO-shp53 Cells Are Tumorigenic, Related to Figure 1Show full caption(A) p53 knock-down in Sirt6 WT and KO primary MEFs.(B) Proliferation assay (upper panel) and colony formation assay (lower panel) of shp53-immortalized Sirt6 WT and KO cells.

(C) The same cells as in B were injected into the flanks of SCID mice and tumor formation analyzed (representative image). Genomic instability can induce transformation by activating oncogenes or inactivating tumor suppressors. Therefore, we first analyzed whether the genomic instability exhibited by SIRT6-deficient cells was responsible for their transformed phenotype. For this purpose, we re-expressed SIRT6 in KO MEFs and injected these cells into nude mice. If genomic instability causes SIRT6-dependent transformation, we would expect tumor formation even in the presence of SIRT6; the effect of mutations occurring on any oncogene or tumor suppressor pathway would not be reverted by simply re-expressing SIRT6 (“mutator phenotype”). However, re-expression of SIRT6 in KO MEFs completely abolished the ability of these cells to form tumors (Figure 1D), suggesting an alternative mechanism for tumor suppression mediated by SIRT6. Furthermore, re-expression of the catalytically inactive SIRT6-H133Y mutant was not able to rescue the tumorigenic phenotype (Figure 1D). Altogether, these results confirm that the tumorigenic capacity of Sirt6 KO MEFs is specific to the lack of this chromatin regulator and that SIRT6 activity is required for its tumor suppressor function. Next, we analyzed whether SIRT6 influences tumor growth in the presence of activating oncogenes. For this purpose, we transformed Sirt6 WT and KO MEFs by expressing an activated form of H-Ras (H-RasV12) and knocking down p53 expression (shp53). We found that, even in the presence of a strong oncogenic signal such as H-RasV12, Sirt6 KO cells exhibited increased anchorage-independent growth in soft agar (Figure 1E) and formed bigger tumors when injected into SCID mice compared to Sirt6 WT cells (Figure 1F), indicating that SIRT6 deficiency also confers a growth advantage to transformed cells. Taken together, these results strongly suggest that SIRT6 is a tumor suppressor involved in both cancer initiation and tumor growth. To identify the mechanism underlying the tumorigenic phenotype associated with SIRT6 deficiency, we focused on SIRT6-dependent regulation of glucose metabolism. Immortalized Sirt6 KO MEFs showed increased glucose uptake and lactate production (Figure 2A). In addition, re-expression of SIRT6 in these cells reduced glucose consumption (Figure 2B) as well as tumor formation (Figure 1D), suggesting that a switch toward aerobic glycolysis may be involved in the tumorigenic process. Furthermore, acute deletion of SIRT6 by adeno-Cre infection in MEFs derived from Sirt6 KO conditional mice (Figure 7) increased glucose uptake in these cells (Figure S2A), confirming that this phenotype is specific to the absence of this chromatin factor. To further characterize the glycolytic phenotype of these cells, we measured expression levels of key glycolytic enzymes that are direct targets for SIRT6 (Zhong et al., 2010Zhong L. D'Urso A. Toiber D. Sebastian C. Henry R.E. Vadysirisack D.D. Guimaraes A. Marinelli B. Wikstrom J.D. Nir T. et al.The histone deacetylase Sirt6 regulates glucose homeostasis via Hif1alpha.Cell. 2010; 140: 280-293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (788) Google Scholar). When compared to WT MEFs, Sirt6 KO MEFs expressed higher levels of Glut1, Pfk1, Pdk1, and Ldha (Figure 2C). Importantly, the expression of these glycolytic genes was further increased in cells derived from Sirt6-deficient tumors (Figure 2C, tumor bar). This may indicate a selective advantage within Sirt6 KO tumors for cells with increased glycolytic activity. To confirm the reliance of Sirt6 KO cells on glycolysis, we analyzed their survival after glucose starvation. Whereas nearly all Sirt6 WT MEFs survived glucose withdrawal, a significant percentage of Sirt6 KO cells died under these conditions (Figure 2D), indicating that SIRT6 deficiency promotes a state of glucose addiction, a hallmark of cancers undergoing aerobic glycolysis.Figure S2Increased Aerobic Glycolysis in Sirt6fl/fl and Ras/shp53-Transformed Sirt6 KO Cells, Related to Figure 2Show full caption(A) Immortalized MEFs derived from Sirt6 conditional mice were infected with adeno-Cre to delete Sirt6 and glucose uptake was measured as indicated in Material and Methods.

The results were expressed as a nM/cell. Error bars indicate SEM. Our results indicate that SIRT6 deficiency plays a crucial role in tumor initiation and growth (Figure 1F). To assess whether increased glycolysis is also responsible for the tumor growth phenotype, we analyzed the glycolytic activity of these cells. We found that Sirt6KO/H-RasV12/shp53-transformed MEFs uptake more glucose (Figure S2B) and produce more lactate in culture (Figure S2C) when compared to Sirt6WT/H-RasV12/shp53 controls. Next, we injected these cells into SCID mice and analyzed glucose uptake in vivo by 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography (FDG-PET). Importantly, tumors derived from transformed Sirt6 KO cells exhibited increased FDG intensity compared to Sirt6 WT cells (Figure 2E), indicating that SIRT6 deficiency in tumors increases glucose uptake and glycolysis both in vitro and in vivo. Together, these results strongly suggest that SIRT6 may act as a tumor suppressor by repressing aerobic glycolysis. The data presented above suggest a role for a SIRT6-dependent glycolytic switch in cancer initiation and progression. Nonetheless, SIRT6 deficiency might promote tumor formation via activation of an oncogenic pathway. To test this possibility, we analyzed the activation of oncogenic signaling pathways in SIRT6-deficient cells. Because deregulation of most oncogenes leads to the activation of the downstream ERK and AKT pathways, we focused on these signaling pathways. Phospho-ERK and phospho-AKT levels were similar in Sirt6 WT and KO MEFs (Figure 3A, left). In addition, primary MEFs immortalized by knocking down p53 exhibited the same phenotype (Figure S3A), ruling out nonspecific effect of the immortalization process. Moreover, activation of these pathways in H-RasV12/shp53-transformed MEFs was similar in the presence or absence of SIRT6 (Figure 3A, middle). These results suggest that tumorigenesis in Sirt6 KO cells is oncogene independent. Importantly, PDK1 and LDHa protein levels were specifically upregulated in both immortalized and transformed Sirt6 KO cells (Figures 3A and S3A), confirming that these cells are highly glycolytic.Figure S3Oncogene-Independent Transformation in Sirt6 KO-shp53 Cells, Related to Figure 3Show full caption(A) Western blots showing the activation of ERK and AKT pathways as well as glycolytic gene expression in shp53-immortalized Sirt6 WT and KO MEFs.(B) Representative images of glucose deprivation-induced cell death in Sirt6 KO and KO-shPDK1 cells.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) (A) Western blots showing the activation of ERK and AKT pathways as well as glycolytic gene expression in shp53-immortalized Sirt6 WT and KO MEFs. (B) Representative images of glucose deprivation-induced cell death in Sirt6 KO and KO-shPDK1 cells. In order to better understand the transformation process in SIRT6-deficient cells, we directly compared Ras-transformed Sirt6 WT cells with immortalized Sirt6 KO cells. To this end, we obtained primary MEFs from WT and KO embryos and infected them in parallel with viruses expressing H-RasV12 plus shp53 or shp53 alone, respectively. As expected, analysis of the ERK and AKT pathways showed strong activation of these proteins in H-RasV12/shp53-transformed Sirt6 WT cells (Figure 3A, right). However, these oncogenic pathways were not activated in shp53-immortalized KO cells, despite their transformation capability. Importantly, LDHa and PDK1 expression was higher in Sirt6 KO cells (Figure 3A), suggesting that enhanced glycolysis, rather than oncogene activation, may be the driving force for tumorigenesis in SIRT6-deficient cells. Further supporting this notion, a colony formation assay indicates similar growth in shp53-immortalized Sirt6 KO cells and H-RasV12/shp53-transformed WT cells (Figure 3B). Similar to the 3T3-immortalized SIRT6-deficient cells, shp53-immortalized Sirt6 KO cells gave rise to tumors when injected into SCID mice (Figure S1C). The above results indicate that SIRT6 acts as a tumor suppressor, potentially by inhibiting a switch toward aerobic glycolysis (Warburg effect). We reasoned that, if this was the case, inhibition of glycolysis would abolish the tumorigenic potential of Sirt6 KO cells. Because conversion of pyruvate to lactate is rate limiting and represents a downstream step in the glycolytic pathway, we aimed to modulate glycolytic activity in SIRT6-deficient cells by controlling this step. For this purpose, we knocked down the expression of Pdk1 by using short hairpin RNAs (shPDK1) (Figure 3C). As expected, PDK1 downregulation reduced PDH phosphorylation (Figure 3C). In addition, Sirt6 KO-shPDK1 cells exhibited reduced proliferative capacity (Figure 3D). Notably, these cells were no longer “glucose addicted,” as reflected by the complete rescue of glucose-starvation-induced cell death (Figures 3E and S3B). Moreover, PDK1 downregulation in Sirt6 KO MEFs inhibited the anchorage-independent cell growth in soft agar (Figure 3F) and severely diminished tumor formation in vivo (Figure 3G). Together, these results demonstrate that SIRT6 may act as a tumor suppressor by blocking a switch toward aerobic glycolysis. In addition, inhibition of glycolysis in SIRT6-deficient cells is sufficient to revert this phenotype, further confirming that these cells have not acquired cancer-driving mutations but rather rely fully on glycolysis for growth. In most cancer cells, increased glycolysis per se is not sufficient to provide a growth advantage, suggesting that SIRT6 might be controlling proliferating genes as well. In order to determine whether this is the case, we used data sets from SIRT6 chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by massively parallel DNA sequencing (ChIP-seq). These data include chromatin maps from two independent cell lines: K562 erythroleukemia cells and human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) (Ram et al., 2011Ram O. Goren A. Amit I. Shoresh N. Yosef N. Ernst J. Kellis M. Gymrek M. Issner R.

Gene ontology analysis of SIRT6-bound genomic regions revealed significant enrichment of ribosomal and ribonucleoprotein genes (Figure 4A). Interestingly, the transcription factor MYC has recently been described as a global regulator of ribosome biogenesis (Arabi et al., 2005Arabi A. Wu S. Ridderstråle K. Bierhoff H. Shiue C. Fatyol K.

To study this possibility, we first compared the SIRT6 genome-wide binding maps with a published MYC ChIP-seq data set (Ram et al., 2011Ram O. Goren A. Amit I. Shoresh N. Yosef N. Ernst J. Kellis M.

USA. 2010; 107: 3639-3644Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) to identify commonly bound genes. Notably, we found that a significantly high percentage of MYC target genes were also enriched for SIRT6 binding (75%; 752/top 1,000 bound genes) (Figure 4B and Table S1). The correlation between SIRT6- and MYC-bound promoters (0.63) was very similar to the one exhibited by the MYC interactors FOS (0.76) and JUN (0.86) (Figure S4A). In contrast, no correlation was observed between SIRT6 and other chromatin modulators, such as EZH2, which is similar to what was observed for Myc (Figure S4B). Moreover, we analyzed the MSigDB gene set collection for their enrichment of overlapping SIRT6-MYC target genes by using the hypergeometric test. We find clear enrichment for genes that fall into ribosome biosynthesis (p = 9 × 10−8), structural constituent of ribosome (p = 0), and translation (p = 1.2 × 10−14) GO categories (Figure 4B, yellow dots; Figure 4C), suggesting that SIRT6 might be involved in the regulation of MYC-dependent ribosomal gene expression. Remarkably, ChIP-seq analysis for SIRT6 and MYC in mouse ES cells showed similar cobinding patterns (data not shown), strongly indicating that such a mechanism is evolutionary conserved.

We have identified a form of PGC-1α (PGC-1α4) that results from alternative promoter usage and splicing of the primary transcript. PGC-1α4 is highly expressed in exercised muscle but does not regulate most known PGC-1α targets such as the mitochondrial OXPHOS genes. Rather, it specifically induces IGF1 and represses myostatin, and expression of PGC-1α4 in vitro and in vivo induces robust skeletal muscle hypertrophy. Importantly, mice with skeletal muscle-specific transgenic expression of PGC-1α4 show increased muscle mass and strength and dramatic resistance to the muscle wasting of cancer cachexia. Expression of PGC-1α4 is preferentially induced in mouse and human muscle during resistance exercise. These studies identify a PGC-1α protein that regulates and coordinates factors involved in skeletal muscle hypertrophy."

Because the principal food source for Drosophila melanogaster is yeast growing on fermenting fruit, flies need to distinguish fruit with safe yeast from yeast covered with toxic microbes. We identify a functionally segregated olfactory circuit in flies that is activated exclusively by geosmin. This microbial odorant constitutes an ecologically relevant stimulus that alerts flies to the presence of harmful microbes. Geosmin activates only a single class of sensory neurons expressing the olfactory receptor Or56a. These neurons target the DA2 glomerulus and connect to projection neurons that respond exclusively to geosmin. Activation of DA2 is sufficient and necessary for aversion, overrides input from other olfactory pathways, and inhibits positive chemotaxis, oviposition, and feeding. The geosmin detection system is a conserved feature in the genus Drosophila that provides flies with a sensitive, specific means of identifying unsuitable feeding and breeding sites.PaperFlickeyJraWQiOiI4ZjUxYWNhY2IzYjhiNjNlNzFlYmIzYWFmYTU5NmZmYyIsImFsZyI6IlJTMjU2In0.eyJzdWIiOiI2MjYyZThjOGVjM2ZkMzEwY2U5ZTcxYWU2ODljNDdhNiIsImtpZCI6IjhmNTFhY2FjYjNiOGI2M2U3MWViYjNhYWZhNTk2ZmZjIiwiZXhwIjoxNjc4NDAxNTg2fQ.Dau4M_nFmc2p4BNor12FkAO7h6xUns5_Ga5KUaMIXU3gxqqpy-Im5aMlhrQLc230VJtuygkA9SMZ9z-1UEP5XqwuB5z9E-3_0wp3fi7FKT9mbTYrMhRhxQNDmDlGZ-3uNyCqPHYMHpiqzLIiVMJ1vCfGVusv8JUTmTfTsni-YoV5JPWxu440VybKLKF8I94smNhGkMWyfVCm7VOa6Z64aj4Dh51JrUE5GjaRBrYVGqucpNBZEWZP4AfBSCOQc3XRylMtVXzNgToaWVUGpsFT9Y2qHcOK-PKAwhFYy5XdF_fs7S04UXoUQAUqyPBJBOBLg5xstLlmTtElFOsM2GmTIw(mp4, (13.55 MB) Download video"

We demonstrate in vivo karyotyping of chromosomes during mitosis and identify different dynamics for the actin cytoskeleton at the dorsal and ventral surfaces of fibroblasts. Compared to spinning disk confocal microscopy, we demonstrate substantially reduced photodamage when imaging rapid morphological changes in D. discoideum cells, as well as improved contrast and resolution at depth within developing C. elegans embryos.

Super-resolution microscopy is extended to densely labeled and multicellular specimens Thin, planar excitation enables multicolor imaging of 3D dynamics over extended times High axial resolution reveals complex 3D dynamics inaccessible to confocal microscopy In vivo karyotyping reveals specific chromosome arrangements during cell division Established imaging technologies such as widefield and confocal microscopy play key roles in elucidating structure and function in biological systems (Stephens and Allan, 2003Stephens D.J. Allan V.J. Light microscopy techniques for live cell imaging.Science. 2003; 300: 82-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (959) Google Scholar). However, as more detailed information has been needed, particularly in the context of in vivo imaging, their limitations have become increasingly clear. One of these is the two-order-of-magnitude gap between the level at which proteins interact within the cell and the resolution limit of light microscopy. Another is the difficulty of imaging specimens in their three-dimensional (3D) entirety without sacrificing spatiotemporal information. Yet a third is the damage induced by light in living systems, particularly when higher resolution, larger volumes, and faster or longer imaging are required (Khodjakov and Rieder, 2006Khodjakov A. Rieder C.L. Imaging the division process in living tissue culture cells.Methods. 2006; 38: 2-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar; Schroeder, 2011Schroeder T. Long-term single-cell imaging of mammalian stem cells.Nat. Methods. 2011; 8: S30-S35Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). In response to these challenges, new technologies have arisen. In particular, several variants of super-resolution microscopy have been developed that offer spatial resolution, depending on the method, from ∼100 nm down to the near-molecular level (Schermelleh et al., 2010Schermelleh L. Heintzmann R. Leonhardt H. A guide to super-resolution fluorescence microscopy.J. Cell Biol. 2010; 190: 165-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (977) Google Scholar). Additionally, plane illumination microscopy has emerged as a powerful tool for less-invasive, long-term 3D imaging in developmental biology (Huisken and Stainier, 2009Huisken J. Stainier D.Y.R. Selective plane illumination microscopy techniques in developmental biology.Development. 2009; 136: 1963-1975Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). Unfortunately, the advantages of these methods are often mutually exclusive: super-resolution is limited to specimens with sparsely distributed fluorescent features, either fixed or slowly evolving over only a few time points, whereas conventional plane illumination sacrifices resolution, particularly along the detection axis, to image at depth in multicellular specimens over broad fields of view. Nevertheless, with a sufficiently thin excitation light sheet, the combination of these methods could prove quite fruitful: the resulting suppression of out-of-focus background could extend widefield cellular super-resolution approaches (Gustafsson, 2000Gustafsson M.G.L. Surpassing the lateral resolution limit by a factor of two using structured illumination microscopy.J. Microsc. 2000; 198: 82-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (2595) Google Scholar; Betzig et al., 2006Betzig E. Patterson G.H. Sougrat R. Lindwasser O.W. Olenych S. Bonifacino J.S. Davidson M.W. Lippincott-Schwartz J. Hess H.F. Imaging intracellular fluorescent proteins at nanometer resolution.Science. 2006; 313: 1642-1645Crossref PubMed Scopus (6307) Google Scholar) to much thicker and/or densely fluorescent specimens, whereas the more efficient expenditure of the fluorescence photon budget in generating only in-focus signal could lead to improved spatiotemporal resolution and reduced phototoxicity. Recently, we described the use of a scanned Bessel beam to confine the excitation in plane illumination microscopy more tightly to the detection focal plane than traditional Gaussian beams allow (Planchon et al., 2011Planchon T.A. Gao L. Milkie D.E. Davidson M.W. Galbraith J.A. Galbraith C.G. Betzig E. Rapid three-dimensional isotropic imaging of living cells using Bessel beam plane illumination.Nat. Methods. 2011; 8: 417-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (821) Google Scholar). We then introduced two modes of Bessel beam plane illumination to achieve near-isotropic, diffraction-limited 3D imaging of living cells. In the first, two-photon excitation (TPE) is used to eliminate unwanted excitation from side lobes of the Bessel beam, resulting in a thinner light sheet. This mode permits the imaging of living cells over dozens to hundreds of time points at up to 200 slice planes per second, given sufficiently dense fluorescent labeling. In the second mode, the Bessel beam is moved in discrete steps across the focal plane to create a periodic excitation pattern, and an optical sectioning algorithm (OS-SIM, Neil et al., 1997Neil M.A.A. Juskaitis R. Wilson T. Method of obtaining optical sectioning by using structured light in a conventional microscope.Opt. Lett. 1997; 22: 1905-1907Crossref PubMed Scopus (950) Google Scholar) is applied to a series of images taken at different phases of the applied excitation pattern to computationally eliminate background fluorescence generated by the side lobes. This mode offers better axial resolution than the TPE mode, as well as simple multicolor capability. Each of these modes has its own limitations. TPE introduces nonlinear photodamage mechanisms, and multicolor imaging is made difficult by the lower TPE photostability of red fluorescent proteins (FPs) compared to green ones, as well as the need for multiple expensive ultrafast lasers. On the other hand, the OS-SIM mode is slow and surprisingly far more phototoxic to live cells than the TPE mode and thus is almost always restricted to imaging fixed cells. In addition, the mathematical operations employed in the OS-SIM algorithm call into question the strict validity of the resulting image reconstructions, a concern reinforced by variations in shape and intensity seen for ostensibly identical structures in such reconstructions. Here we address all these issues by introducing Bessel beam super-resolution structured plane illumination (Bessel plane SR-SIM), which combines the tightly confined planar illumination of a periodically stepped Bessel beam with the principles of widefield 3D super-resolution structured illumination microscopy (widefield SR-SIM, Gustafsson et al., 2008Gustafsson M.G.L. Shao L. Carlton P.M. Wang C.J.R. Golubovskaya I.N. Cande W.Z. Agard D.A. Sedat J.W. Three-dimensional resolution doubling in wide-field fluorescence microscopy by structured illumination.Biophys. J. 2008; 94: 4957-4970Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1104) Google Scholar) to achieve noninvasive multicolor imaging of rapid 3D biological processes in thick living specimens. Although providing only modest gains in theoretical resolution extension beyond the diffraction limit, we demonstrate, by comparison to Bessel plane OS-SIM and spinning disk confocal microscopy (SDCM), substantial gains in the practical resolvability, contrast, and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) on samples ranging from single microtubules to D. melanogaster embryos. Similarly, although the theoretical lateral resolution limits are slightly less than in widefield SR-SIM, we show the superiority of Bessel plane SR-SIM when imaging live samples ∼10 μm thick or greater, such as mitotic cells and C. elegans embryos. Furthermore, we demonstrate substantially reduced phototoxicity relative to the Bessel plane TPE mode and SDCM when imaging fast-membrane dynamics both internally and at the surface of densely fluorescent COS-7 and light-sensitive D. discoideum cells. Lastly, we show that SR-SIM can be extended to image portions of specimens hundreds of microns in size, such as the adult brain of D. melanogaster and the entire C. elegans L1 larval worm, by combining Bessel structured plane illumination with the greater depth penetration afforded by two-photon excitation. In short, the theoretical resolution limits of microscopes are difficult to achieve in many biological samples, particularly as one pushes further and further beyond the diffraction limit. In addition, the successful imaging of dynamics in living systems, particularly in 3D, involves tradeoffs of spatial resolution, temporal resolution, and phototoxicity that render irrelevant a single-minded focus on spatial resolution alone. Through a unique combination of high speed, low phototoxicity, and volumetric resolution ∼2–3× beyond the diffraction limit, Bessel plane SR-SIM permits the investigation of complex biological processes that require fast, high-resolution 3D imaging to visualize subcellular detail over many time points, not only in the optically tractable but biologically artificial context of immortalized cultured cells but also in the more physiologically relevant context of interacting cells within whole multicellular organisms. Among other examples, we use these capabilities to identify and track every chromosome in an aneuploid cell during mitosis, thus opening the door to direct visualization of stereotypical chromosome arrangements and deviations therefrom during cell division, and identify a diverse range of actin dynamics at different planes throughout the volume of motile cells, such as a correlation between the lateral movement of single D. discoideum cells and rapid flows of actin to and from the supporting substrate. Motivated by the surprising phototoxicity, poor SNR, and apparent artifacts in our previous Bessel plane OS-SIM (Planchon et al., 2011Planchon T.A. Gao L. Milkie D.E. Davidson M.W. Galbraith J.A. Galbraith C.G. Betzig E. Rapid three-dimensional isotropic imaging of living cells using Bessel beam plane illumination.Nat. Methods. 2011; 8: 417-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (821) Google Scholar), we decided instead to adapt the algorithms of 3D widefield SR-SIM (Gustafsson et al., 2008Gustafsson M.G.L. Shao L. Carlton P.M. Wang C.J.R. Golubovskaya I.N. Cande W.Z. Agard D.A. Sedat J.W. Three-dimensional resolution doubling in wide-field fluorescence microscopy by structured illumination.Biophys. J. 2008; 94: 4957-4970Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1104) Google Scholar) to Bessel microscopy, in part to hopefully address the limitations of OS-SIM, and in part to extend the super-resolution capabilities of widefield SR-SIM to thicker and/or more densely fluorescent specimens. The experimental architecture and operation of the resulting method, termed Bessel beam super-resolution structured plane illumination microscopy (Bessel plane SR-SIM), are identical to Bessel plane OS-SIM: two microscope objectives sharing a common focal point are mounted at right angles to one another (Figures S1A and S1B available online) in a medium-filled, temperature-controlled sample chamber (SC, Figure S1C). The first, or excitation, objective generates the Bessel beam: a narrow yet very long pencil of light surrounded by progressively weaker side lobes (Figure S2A). At each plane of the specimen, the beam is scanned in discrete steps (Figure S2B) to create a periodic excitation pattern (Figure S2D, left) consisting of a comb of n discrete harmonics in frequency space (Figure S2D, center). n images are recorded per plane as the pattern is translated in n equal fractions of one period and then reconstructed into a single image. This process is then repeated at successive planes to build a 3D image of the specimen.Figure S2Characterization of Structured Illumination Planes Created with Bessel Beams and Linear Excitation, Related to Figure 1Show full caption(A) Cross-sectional profile of a Bessel beam.(B) In the stepped mode, the beam is moved in discrete steps, represented as a periodic linear array of delta functions.(C) In the sine mode, the beam is swept continuously, but its intensity is modulated sinusoidally using an acousto-optic tunable filter/modulator.(D) Characterization of stepped mode illumination.

Sidebands are not as strong as those at the same spatial frequency produced by stepped excitation (D), yet the need for only three images in the reconstruction increases speed and can lead to lower phototoxicity. Comparison of the exact same data sets analyzed by either Bessel plane OS-SIM or Bessel plane SR-SIM (Figures 1A–1C) confirms the limitations of the former and the superiority of the latter. Indeed, a theoretical analysis of the method of image reconstruction by the two methods reveals why: in OS-SIM, out-of-focus information encoded in the central DC harmonic is eliminated, leading to its optical sectioning capability. However, the information encoded by all the other harmonics is also eliminated, except for one (red arrows to the right of center in Figure S2D, right). Because this harmonic represents only a small fraction of the total spectral energy in the excitation, most of the useful information contained in the original data is discarded. Consequently, much higher excitation power is required to achieve an adequate SNR in the reconstructed image, leading to premature bleaching and photodamage. Furthermore, the phase and amplitude of each spatial frequency in the reconstruction are not correctly recovered, leading, as seen in an image of microtubules in a fixed LLC-PK1 cell (Figure 1A, left), to artifacts such as granularity, asymmetric image contrast, and an overweighting of low spatial frequencies (Figure 1B, left) that makes the resolution appear poorer than the theoretical limit of diffraction (Figure 1B, green and blue curves). Bessel plane SR-SIM resolves all these issues (Figure 1A, right): the SNR is improved, as the information encoded by all harmonics is used, and the microtubules are uniform in thickness and intensity, as both the amplitude and phase of all spatial frequencies are reconstructed accurately. Furthermore, the nonzero harmonics encode sample information at spatial frequencies beyond the diffraction limit, and these are also accurately assigned in the SR-SIM reconstruction to achieve super-resolution in the scan (x) and axial (z) directions (Figure 1B, right), with the amount of resolution improvement determined by the numerical apertures of both the excitation and detection objectives (Figure S1B). The advantages of the SR-SIM mode are also apparent in 3D images of the dynamics induced by the signaling kinase cSrc in a living COS-7 cell (Figure 1C, top and Movie S1): far more detail at higher contrast and better SNR is observed for small membrane ruffles and intracellular vesicles, even those larger than the diffraction limit, than when the same data are analyzed by OS-SIM (Figure 1C, middle). In addition, the cell exhibited no noticeable photodamage over 110 3D stacks (Figure 1C, top right), whereas a similar cell imaged in the TPE mode displayed noticeable photo-induced retraction after 60 3D stacks (Figure 1C, bottom right, from Planchon et al., 2011Planchon T.A. Gao L. Milkie D.E. Davidson M.W. Galbraith J.A. Galbraith C.G. Betzig E. Rapid three-dimensional isotropic imaging of living cells using Bessel beam plane illumination.Nat. Methods. 2011; 8: 417-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (821) Google Scholar). Further contributing to the lower phototoxicity was the use of a diffractive optical element (DOE, Figure S1C) to produce an array of seven parallel Bessel beams (Figures S1D–S1F) of proportionally lower peak power. Overall, the combination of SR-SIM with parallel Bessel beams has proved substantially less invasive than either of our earlier TPE or OS-SIM modes for dozens of combinations of cell lines and fluorescent targets, permitting 3D dynamic processes to be followed over more time points and with increased confidence in the physiological nature of the observations. As an example, we consider macropinocytosis, the process by which membrane ruffles fold over (Figure 1D, yellow and green arrows) and encapsulate extracellular fluid to form intracellular vacuoles (Figure 1E, green, red, and yellow pluses). Although complex processes such as this are in principle accessible to conventional methods such as widefield 3D deconvolution and optically sectioned confocal microscopy, Bessel SR-SIM offers at least 2× higher axial resolution, better image contrast at high spatial frequencies, particularly in densely fluorescent cells such as this, and the high imaging speed (21 planes/s, Movie S1) needed to reveal the stages of this process with sufficient spatiotemporal detail for the quantification of events such as changes in the shape, volume, and velocity of individual vesicles. Indeed, due to the triple limitations of speed, axial resolution, and photodamage that plague conventional microscopy, much of our knowledge of cellular dynamics comes from 2D imaging of inherently 3D processes. For example, although total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy (TIRFM; Axelrod, 2001Axelrod D. Total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy in cell biology.Traffic. 2001; 2: 764-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (731) Google Scholar) has provided an unambiguous picture of events at the ventral surface of cultured cells, similar clarity at the dorsal surface (which, by virtue of its proximity to the extracellular environment and neighboring cells, may prove more interesting) has been lacking. However, Bessel plane SR-SIM can readily distinguish the dorsal and ventral membranes and simultaneously image the differing dynamics at each. Consider, for example, the dynamics of the actin cytoskeleton, whose organization and dynamics relative to the overall 3D cellular architecture are poorly understood. Seen from above (Figure 2A and upper left of Movie S2), a live fox lung cell exhibits waves of centripetally flowing stress fibers, known as actin arcs (Burnette et al., 2011Burnette D.T. Manley S. Sengupta P. Sougrat R. Davidson M.W. Kachar B. Lippincott-Schwartz J. A role for actin arcs in the leading-edge advance of migrating cells.Nat. Cell Biol. 2011; 13: 371-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Cross-sectional views (Figure 2B and upper right of Movie S2) reveal that these contracting arcs are at the dorsal surface, flowing inward at ∼0.3 μm/min, whereas actin fibers at the ventral surface (magenta arrows) are predominantly static. This suggests that the fibers at the two surfaces play different roles in force generation and the emergence of cell shape and mechanics. As the arcs move farther up the dorsal surface and approach the nucleus, they abruptly spring away from the membrane and straighten, as if under substantial stress (lower right of Movie S2 and green and yellow arrows, Figure 2B). Finally, they dive deeper within the cytosol at a faster rate of ∼1.2 μm/min before depolymerizing (upper right of Movie S2 and missing green arrow at 22 min, Figure 2B), highlighting their intrinsic instability away from the cortical zone. Similar behaviors of correlated straightening (Figure 2C) and detachment (Figure 2D) are seen in live U2OS cells, as well as curved arcs for those filaments still localized at the dorsal membrane (Figure 2E). Note that it is only with high speed and high resolution in all directions and over many time points (96 volumes at 30 s intervals in Movie S2) that these processes can be fully understood. Given that the performance of Bessel beam plane illumination is enhanced so much by its combination with SR-SIM, it is natural to ask how it compares with the earlier widefield form of 3D SR-SIM (Gustafsson et al., 2008Gustafsson M.G.L. Shao L. Carlton P.M. Wang C.J.R. Golubovskaya I.N. Cande W.Z. Agard D.A. Sedat J.W. Three-dimensional resolution doubling in wide-field fluorescence microscopy by structured illumination.Biophys. J. 2008; 94: 4957-4970Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1104) Google Scholar), and whether the Bessel component is even necessary. The answer lies in the imaging of densely fluorescent and/or thick specimens. For example, when imaging densely labeled histones in living LLC-PK1 cells in anaphase, the chromosomes are readily resolved in all three orthogonal projections by Bessel plane SR-SIM (Figure 3A) but are more poorly resolved, particularly in the axial direction, by widefield 3D SR-SIM (Figure 3B)—despite the fact that the theoretical resolution of the latter (120 nm × 120 nm × 360 nm [x,y,z]) is substantially better than that of the former (233 nm × 328 nm × 425 nm in this example; Table S1). Part of the problem is that, because the entire sample is illuminated in the widefield case, the background haze from out-of-focus fluorescence becomes increasingly strong as the sample becomes thicker (i.e., ∼15 μm for the cells here) or more densely fluorescent (i.e., the cell in Figures 1C–1E), making it increasingly difficult to extract the much weaker high-resolution information encoded by the finely structured excitation. On the other hand, in Bessel plane SR-SIM, the excitation is largely confined to the focal plane, independent of the sample thickness, so the resolution gains provided by SR-SIM are retained. Similar results are seen in images of live, early-stage, membrane-labeled C. elegans embryos: the reduction of out-of-focus excitation with Bessel plane illumination (Figure 3C) leads to higher image contrast and better SNR throughout the embryo and better effective resolution (theoretically, 194 nm × 238 nm × 419 nm) than widefield 3D SIM (Figure 3D) beyond the first few microns in depth. Indeed, nearly no useful signal remains in widefield SIM in the lower half of the embryo (Figure 3D, right). This may also be due in part to sample-induced aberrations affecting either the excitation pattern or the detection resolution. The steep angle light rays in high numerical aperture objectives are more strongly affected by such aberrations (Ji et al., 2010Ji N. Milkie D.E. Betzig E. Adaptive optics via pupil segmentation for high-resolution imaging in biological tissues.Nat. Methods. 2010; 7: 141-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). Thus, widefield SIM, which depends upon higher numerical aperture excitation than Bessel plane SR-SIM in order to achieve its theoretically higher resolution, is more strongly affected when imaging through microns of heterogeneous biological material. Furthermore, the axial extent of a focused beam grows rapidly with increasing aberration (Ji et al., 2010Ji N. Milkie D.E. Betzig E. Adaptive optics via pupil segmentation for high-resolution imaging in biological tissues.Nat. Methods. 2010; 7: 141-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). Whereas this rapidly degrades the axial resolution in widefield SIM, Bessel plane SR-SIM, which by design exploits the very long axial extent of a Bessel beam, is relatively unaffected. Of course, for sparsely labeled, index-matched samples or those less than 5–10 microns thick, the practical resolution of widefield 3D SR-SIM approaches its theoretical limit and outperforms Bessel plane SR-SIM. Indeed, recently, widefield SIM at high resolution has been applied to live imaging of thin cells at rates of 2 to 6 planes/s (Shao et al., 2011Shao L. Kner P. Rego E.H. Gustafsson M.G.L.

Using genetically engineered mice, we show that precocious Norrin production leads to premature retinal vascular invasion and delayed Norrin production leads to characteristic defects in intraretinal vascular architecture. In genetic mosaics, wild-type endothelial cells (ECs) instruct neighboring Fz4(-/-) ECs to produce an architecturally normal mosaic vasculature, a cell nonautonomous effect. However, over the ensuing weeks, Fz4(-/-) ECs are selectively eliminated from the mosaic vasculature, implying the existence of a quality control program that targets defective ECs. In the adult retina and cerebellum, gain or loss of Norrin/Fz4 signaling results in a cell-autonomous gain or loss, respectively, of blood retina barrier and blood brain barrier function, indicating an ongoing requirement for Frizzled signaling in barrier maintenance and substantial plasticity in mature CNS vascular structure."

Centrosomes, the primary site of nucleation in most cells, lose their function as microtubule organizing centers during neuronal development. How neurons generate acentrosomal microtubules remains unclear. Drosophila dendritic arborization (da) neurons lack centrosomes and therefore provide a model system to study acentrosomal microtubule nucleation. Here, we investigate the origin of microtubules within the elaborate dendritic arbor of class IV da neurons. Using a combination of in vivo and in vitro techniques, we find that Golgi outposts can directly nucleate microtubules throughout the arbor. This acentrosomal nucleation requires gamma-tubulin and CP309, the Drosophila homolog of AKAP450, and contributes to the complex microtubule organization within the arbor and dendrite branch growth and stability. Together, these results identify a direct mechanism for acentrosomal microtubule nucleation within neurons and reveal a function for Golgi outposts in this process."

We developed a plaque-specific antibody that targets a modified Aβ peptide (Aβ(p3-42)), which showed robust clearance of pre-existing plaque without causing microhemorrhage. Interestingly, a comparator N-terminal Aβ antibody 3D6, which binds both soluble and insoluble Aβ(1-42), lacked efficacy for lowering existing plaque but manifested a significant microhemorrhage liability. Mechanistic studies suggested that the lack of efficacy for 3D6 was attributed to poor target engagement in plaques. These studies have profound implications for the development of therapeutic Aβ antibodies for Alzheimer's disease."

Cycling between ATP-bound and ADP/substrate-bound states requires Hsp70s to visit a state with high ATPase activity and fast on/off kinetics of substrate binding. We have trapped this ""allosterically active"" state for the E. coli Hsp70, DnaK, and identified how interactions among the NBD, the β subdomain of the SBD, the SBD α-helical lid, and the conserved hydrophobic interdomain linker enable allosteric signal transmission between ligand-binding sites. Allostery in Hsp70s results from an energetic tug-of-war between domain conformations and formation of two orthogonal interfaces: between the NBD and SBD, and between the helical lid and the β subdomain of the SBD. The resulting energetic tension underlies Hsp70 functional properties and enables them to be modulated by ligands and cochaperones and ""tuned"" through evolution."

DNA methylation at the 5-position of cytosine (5mC) is a key epigenetic mark playing crucial roles in vertebrate development (Bestor and Coxon, 1993Bestor T.H. Coxon A.

Recent studies have demonstrated that the Tet family of 5mC hydroxylases can catalyze the conversion of 5mC to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) (Tahiliani et al., 2009Tahiliani M. Koh K.P. Shen Y.

These studies also suggest that additional modification of 5mC modulated by Tet enzymes may regulate the dynamics of 5mC and its mediated gene regulation (Branco et al., 2012Branco M.R. Ficz G.

In addition, Tet3 is the only Tet family member highly expressed in mouse oocytes and zygotes and is responsible for the hydroxylation of 5mC that occurs in the paternal pronucleus of advanced pronuclear-stage zygotes (Gu et al., 2011Gu T.-P.

Conditional knockout of Tet3 in mouse oocytes prevents resetting of DNA methylation patterns in zygotes and impairs reprogramming of transferred somatic nuclei (Gu et al., 2011Gu T.-P. Guo F. Yang H. Wu H.-P. Xu G.-F. Liu W. Xie Z.-G. Shi L. He X.

Nevertheless, Tet3−/− knockout mice are viable through development, but die on postnatal day one (Gu et al., 2011Gu T.-P. Guo F. Yang H. Wu H.-P. Xu G.-F. Liu W. Xie Z.-G. Shi L. He X.

Taken together, although the discovery of the Tet family of 5mC hydroxylases provides a potential mechanism for the dynamic regulation of DNA methylation, it remains unclear how Tet proteins are recruited to and regulate the expression of target genes, thereby providing linkage to their specific functions in early vertebrate embryonic development. Although all Tet family members contain a conserved C-terminal catalytic domain, only Tet1 and Tet3 contain the CXXC domain, a potential DNA binding module characterized by two CXXCXXC repeats. The CXXC domains, found in other proteins such as DNMT1, MLL, and CFP1, have been shown to specifically bind to unmethylated CpG dinucleotides and participate in gene transcription regulation (Allen et al., 2006Allen M.D. Grummitt C.G.

The structural basis for selective binding of non-methylated CpG islands by the CFP1 CXXC domain.Nat. Commun. 2011; 2: 227Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Although our previous study has suggested an important role of the CXXC domain in targeting Tet1 enzyme to specific genomic regions in ES cells (Xu et al., 2011bXu Y. Wu F. Tan L. Kong L. Xiong L. Deng J. Barbera A.J. Zheng L. Zhang H. Huang S. et al.Genome-wide regulation of 5hmC, 5mC, and gene expression by Tet1 hydroxylase in mouse embryonic stem cells.Mol. Cell. 2011; 42: 451-464Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar), the molecular mechanism and biological importance of this domain in Tet1- and Tet3-mediated transcriptional regulation of target genes remain largely unknown. In this report, we characterize the molecular and biochemical properties and the biological function of Tet3 by using Xenopus as a model. Our study shows that Tet3 is essential for early eye and neural development in Xenopus. We also demonstrate that several master control genes essential for eye and neural development are Tet3’s direct targets, mechanistically linking Tet3 function in transcriptional regulation of these key genes to the developmental phenotypes caused by Tet3 depletion. Using structural and mutational analyses and functional rescue approaches, we show that Tet3’s 5mC hydroxylase and the CXXC domain-mediated DNA binding activities cooperate to regulate target gene expression during eye and neural development. To understand the biological function of Tet proteins in early embryonic development, we investigated Tet family members in Xenopus. Database searches reveal two Tet orthologs in Xenopus tropicalis, Tet2 and Tet3, but not Tet1 (Figure S1A available online). We cloned Xenopus laevis Tet3 (xlTet3) gene and subsequently discovered two xlTet3 isoforms (HQ220207-xlTet3a and HQ220208-xlTet3b) that exhibit greater than 90% amino acid similarity to xtTet3 (Figure S1A). Surprisingly, despite extensive searching, we were unable to identify a Tet1 ortholog in either X. tropicalis or X. laevis. We, therefore, conclude that the Xenopus genome contains only two Tet-related genes, Tet2 and Tet3, and lacks a Tet1 gene. Sequence analysis reveals that similar to mammalian Tet3 proteins (which we cloned, validated, and deposited into GeneBank; HQ220209, human TET3; and HQ423151, mouse Tet3), Xenopus Tet3 contains a CXXC domain, a cysteine-rich domain and a double-stranded β helix (DSBH)-containing dioxygenase domain (Figure S1A). We next examined the expression profile of xlTet3 during embryogenesis. The temporal expression pattern of xlTet3 by RT-qPCR reveals that, unlike the high level of Tet3 mRNA observed in mouse oocytes (Gu et al., 2011Gu T.-P. Guo F. Yang H. Wu H.-P. Xu G.-F. Liu W. Xie Z.-G. Shi L. He X.

Walter J. 5-Hydroxymethylcytosine in the mammalian zygote is linked with epigenetic reprogramming.Nat. Commun. 2011; 2: 241Crossref PubMed Scopus (609) Google Scholar), the xlTet3 mRNA level in oocytes is very low. xlTet3 mRNA is also barely detectable at stage 2 (2-cell stage) through stage 7, but increases dramatically from stage 9 (immediately after the initiation of zygotic transcription) to stage 19 and then drops at stage 25 (Figure S1B). The spatial expression pattern of xlTet3 by in situ hybridization shows that xlTet3 mRNA is barely detectable at stage 9 (Figure 1A), but clearly detected by stage 14 in the neural plate (Figure 1B). In embryo sections, we also detect xlTet3 mRNA in the neural plate and notochord (Figures S1C and S1D). Moreover, xlTet3 mRNA level remains high in the neural tube at stage 19 (Figure 1C) and in the region of the developing brain, eye, branchial arches, cement gland, and spinal cord at stage 25 (Figures 1D and 1E). To address Tet3 function during embryogenesis, we performed loss-of-function studies by depleting endogenous xlTet3 protein by using the Morpholino antisense oligo (MO) strategy. We first confirmed that xlTet3 MOs efficiently deplete Tet3 protein (Figure 1F). Control MO or xlTet3 MOs were injected into two dorsal blastomeres of 4-cell stage embryos. At stage 35, we observe striking developmental abnormalities in 96% (194/201) of xlTet3 MOs-injected embryos, including malformation of the eye (eyeless), small head, and missing pigmentation along the lateral body, whereas control embryos develop normally (Figure 1G). The Tet3-depleted embryos die between stages 35 and 40. Importantly, these phenotypes are rescued by coinjecting the xlTet3 MOs-resistant xtTet3 mRNA (Figure 1G, right). Taken together, these data suggest that Tet3 plays an essential role in early embryogenesis, especially in early eye and neural development. To gain insight into the underlying molecular mechanisms linking Tet3 function to early eye and neural development, we examined the effect of Tet3 depletion on the expression of a set of key developmental genes, including pax6 (eye and neural marker), rx and six3 (eye markers), sox2 (pan-neural marker), otx2 (anterior neural marker), sox9 and snail (neural crest markers), neurogenin related 1 (ngn2) and n-tubulin (tubb2b) (primary neuron markers), and shh and ptc-1 (sonic hedgehog signaling) in stage 14 embryos. MOs were injected into one dorsal blastomere of 4-cell stage embryos so that the uninjected side could be used as an internal control. For shh and ptc-1 measurement, we injected MOs into two dorsal blastomeres of 4-cell stage embryos because the expression of shh and ptc-1 is in the midline. As shown by in situ hybridization, the expression of master eye developmental genes, pax6, rx, and six3, is greatly reduced on the xlTet3 MOs-injected side compared to the uninjected side at stage 14 (Figure 2A). Reduced expression of these eye genes is also seen in the potential eye field on the Tet3-depleted side at stage 19 (Figure S2A). Depletion of Tet3 also inhibits the expression of two primary neuron markers, ngn2 and tubb2b, and two neural crest markers, sox9 and snail, supporting a critical role of Tet3 in neural and neural crest development (Figure 2A). The expression of two major shh signaling components, shh and ptc-1, is also abolished in Tet3-depleted embryos at stage 14 (Figure 2A), whereas the expression of otx2 and sox2 shows no significant changes (Figure S2B). Importantly, the diminished expression of all affected genes is rescued by xtTet3 mRNA coinjection (Figure 2A), demonstrating the specific regulation of these genes by Tet3. Results by in situ hybridization are further independently confirmed by RT-qPCR assays (Figures 2B and S2C).Figure S2The Regulation of Gene Expression by Tet3, Related to Figure 2Show full caption(A) The inhibition of pax6, rx and six3 expression by Tet3 depletion in stage 19 embryos (anterior view).

To address whether Tet3 directly regulates these key genes, we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays. We employed an epitope-tagged ChIP assay by using Flag antibody and flag-xtTet3 mRNA-injected embryos to explore Tet3 occupancy at the promoters of these genes. We detect strong Tet3 binding at the promoters of pax6, rx, six3, ptc-1, ptc-2, sox9, and ngn2 but not at the promoters of control genes, myosin light chain 2 (myl2), and cardiac actin (actc) (Figure 2C). Finally, we tested whether ectopic expression of any one of these downstream Tet3 target genes can rescue the phenotypes caused by Tet3 depletion. We examined the rescue effects of pax6, rx, or shh overexpression. As shown in Figure S2D, none of these can rescue the phenotypes, suggesting that it may be the cumulative effect of the altered expression of a group of target genes, rather than a single gene, that causes the observed developmental defects. Nevertheless, our data strongly suggest that Tet3 is an upstream transcriptional regulator specifically and directly controlling a set of key genes important for early eye and neural development. As DNA methylation at gene promoters has regulatory effects on the expression of the associated genes, we asked whether Xenopus Tet3 modulates the 5mC/5hmC status at its target gene promoters. To address this question, we first demonstrate that Xenopus Tet3 has conserved 5mC hydroxylase activity as mammalian Tet proteins. The xlTet3 catalytic domain (CD) can convert 5mC to 5hmC in cells and in vitro (Figures 3A and 3B ). Utilizing two independent methods, anti-5hmC antibody-based dot-blot and T4 Phage β-glucosyltransferase-mediated 5hmC glucosylation assays, we demonstrate that 5hmC exists in the genome of Xenopus embryos and is globally reduced after Tet3 depletion (Figure 3C). However, consistent with undetectable or extremely low levels of 5fC and 5CaC in ES cells and various tissues (Globisch et al., 2010Globisch D. Münzel M. Müller M. Michalakis S. Wagner M. Koch S. Brückl T. Biel M. Carell T.

Dai Q. Wu S.C. Collins L.B. Swenberg J.A. He C. Zhang Y.

Collectively, these data suggest that Tet3 possesses intrinsic 5mC hydroxylase activity and is, at least in part, responsible for modulating 5hmC levels in Xenopus embryos. We next asked whether Tet3 regulates 5hmC levels at target gene promoters. We first examined the dynamic 5hmC level changes by hydroxymethylated DNA immunoprecipitation (hMeDIP)-qPCR (Xu et al., 2011bXu Y. Wu F. Tan L. Kong L. Xiong L. Deng J. Barbera A.J. Zheng L. Zhang H. Huang S. et al.Genome-wide regulation of 5hmC, 5mC, and gene expression by Tet1 hydroxylase in mouse embryonic stem cells.Mol. Cell. 2011; 42: 451-464Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar). Consistent with the increasing Tet3 expression from stage 10 to 19 (Figure S1B), we observe increasing 5hmC levels at a Tet3 target gene promoter, rx promoter, but not at the nontargeted actc promoter (Figures 3D and 3E). Importantly, Tet3 depletion results in a significant reduction in 5hmC at rx promoter at stages 14 and 19, thereby significantly abolishing the increase in 5hmC from stage 10 to 14 to 19 (p < 0.05), whereas no 5hmC level changes are observed at actc promoter (Figure 3E). However, we failed to detect 5hmC level changes at other Tet3 target gene promoters including pax6, six3, sox9, and ptc-2 by hMeDIP-qPCR perhaps due to the low 5hmC levels at those promoters and the detection limits of hMeDIP-qPCR. Thus, we applied a more sensitive CCGG site-dependent strategy, EpiMark method (Ficz et al., 2011Ficz G. Branco M.R. Seisenberger S. Santos F. Krueger F. Hore T.A. Marques C.J. Andrews S. Reik W. Dynamic regulation of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine in mouse ES cells and during differentiation.Nature. 2011; 473: 398-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (901) Google Scholar). As exemplified by pax6 and ptc-2, depletion of Tet3 results in a significant reduction in 5hmC at CCGG sites of both promoters (p < 0.05), whereas no 5hmC changes are observed at the nontargeted myl2 and actc genes (Figure 3F). To next determine the 5hmC status at multiple CpG sites, we employed the newly developed Tet-assisted bisulfite sequencing (TAB-Seq) approach (Yu et al., 2012Yu M. Hon G.C. Szulwach K.E. Song C.-X. Zhang L. Kim A. Li X. Dai Q. Shen Y. Park B. et al.Base-resolution analysis of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine in the mammalian genome.Cell. 2012; 149: 1368-1380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (783) Google Scholar), the most sensitive method to specifically detect 5hmC at base-pair resolution. We first confirm that more than 90% of 5mCs in the internal control DNA oligo have been converted by TET1 CD (Figures S3A–S3C). Using pax6 as an example, we clearly observe a significant decrease in 5hmC at specific CpG sites within the pax6 promoter after Tet3 depletion (p < 0.05 by one-way ANOVA), whereas the 5hmC levels at actc promoter are not changed (Figure 3G), consistent with that observed via the EpiMark method. Taken together, by employing multiple approaches to analyze changes in 5hmC at promoters after Tet3 depletion, we demonstrate that Tet3 regulates the 5hmC status at its target gene promoters. Finally, we addressed the extent to which 5hmC level decrease by Tet3 depletion results in a subsequent 5mC level increase. Notably, examining the alteration of 5mC directly resulting from the change of 5hmC at Tet3 target gene promoters is extremely technically challenging. Like most Xenopus genes, Tet3 exhibits specific spatial-temporal expression in embryos (Figures 1B–1E). Thus, changes in 5mC caused by Tet3 depletion are expected to occur only in the small fraction of the embryo expressing Tet3, whereas 5mC remains unchanged in the rest of embryo, effectively diluting the signal from Tet3-expressing cells. Indeed, using the whole embryos, we attempted and failed to detect 5mC changes after Tet3 depletion by multiple approaches, such as methylated DNA immunoprecipitation (MeDIP) and methylated CpG island recovery assay. We therefore developed a targeting strategy, employing hMeDIP-MeDIP qPCR to separate the signal from the noise and examine the 5mC level changes directly resulting from 5hmC level changes by Tet3 depletion (Figure 3H). We first performed hMeDIP to enrich 5hmC-containing genomic DNA fragments that presumably are from Tet-expressing cells. Given that Tet3 depletion results in a 5hmC level decrease but not complete removal, Tet3-targeted DNAs in xlTet3 MOs-treated embryos still contain 5hmC and can be enriched, albeit with a lower amount than the control embryos. We then carried out MeDIP by using the hMeDIPed DNA as input to examine relative 5mC levels in those 5hmC-containing DNAs given the dynamic conversion of 5mC to 5hmC and the coexistence of 5mC and 5hmC in the same region (Ficz et al., 2011Ficz G. Branco M.R. Seisenberger S. Santos F. Krueger F. Hore T.A. Marques C.J. Andrews S. Reik W.

We first confirm that the different amount of starting DNA (hMeDIPed DNA) will not introduce a MeDIP efficiency bias, as validated by the equal MeDIP enrichment of the human NBR2 promoter from control DNA spiked in the hMeDIPed DNA from control MO- or Tet3 MOs-injected embryos (Figure S3D). For proof-of-principle, we examined the rx gene promoter because it has the most dramatic changes in 5hmC after Tet3 depletion and can be easily detected (Figure 3E). Indeed, we clearly observe a significant 5mC level increase at rx gene promoter after Tet3 depletion by this hMeDIP-MeDIP qPCR method in stage 14 and 19 embryos (Figure 3I), whereas the 5mC level at actc promoter is not changed (Figure 3I), validating the reliability of hMeDIP-MeDIP qPCR procedure. Thus, we conclude that Tet3 regulates target gene expression, at least partially, through control of 5mC/5hmC status at the promoter of target genes. In addition to the dioxygenase domain that confers 5mC hydroxylase activity, Tet3 also contains a potential DNA binding domain, the CXXC domain. In general, the selective DNA binding activity of a transcription factor serves as a key mechanism for action of the transcription factor in gene transcriptional regulation. Sequence"

Here we use chronic two-photon calcium imaging to explore how wakefulness and experience shape odor representations in the mouse olfactory bulb. Comparing the awake and anesthetized state, we show that wakefulness greatly enhances the activity of inhibitory granule cells and makes principal mitral cell odor responses more sparse and temporally dynamic. In awake mice, brief repeated odor experience leads to a gradual and long-lasting (months) weakening of mitral cell odor representations. This mitral cell plasticity is odor specific, recovers gradually over months, and can be repeated with different odors. Furthermore, the expression of this experience-dependent plasticity is prevented by anesthesia. Together, our results demonstrate the dynamic nature of mitral cell odor representations in awake animals, which is constantly shaped by recent odor experience."
https://openalex.org/W2090421229,"Hair cells are mechanosensors for the perception of sound, acceleration, and fluid motion. Mechanotransduction channels in hair cells are gated by tip links, which connect the stereocilia of a hair cell in the direction of their mechanical sensitivity. The molecular constituents of the mechanotransduction channels of hair cells are not known. Here, we show that mechanotransduction is impaired in mice lacking the tetraspan TMHS. TMHS binds to the tip-link component PCDH15 and regulates tip-link assembly, a process that is disrupted by deafness-causing Tmhs mutations. TMHS also regulates transducer channel conductance and is required for fast channel adaptation. TMHS therefore resembles other ion channel regulatory subunits such as the transmembrane alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid (AMPA) receptor regulatory proteins (TARPs) of AMPA receptors that facilitate channel transport and regulate the properties of pore-forming channel subunits. We conclude that TMHS is an integral component of the hair cell's mechanotransduction machinery that functionally couples PCDH15 to the transduction channel."

We gathered transcriptome data from the leaves of rice plants in a paddy field along with the corresponding meteorological data and used them to develop statistical models for the endogenous and external influences on gene expression. Our results indicate that the transcriptome dynamics are predominantly governed by endogenous diurnal rhythms, ambient temperature, plant age, and solar radiation. The data revealed diurnal gates for environmental stimuli to influence transcription and pointed to relative influences exerted by circadian and environmental factors on different metabolic genes. The model also generated predictions for the influence of changing temperatures on transcriptome dynamics.

It is important to build on the knowledge collected under simple, controlled laboratory conditions to account for the more complex responses that occur outside of the laboratory, as currently our understanding of how organisms respond to natural conditions in the field remains limited. Examples include how plants respond to complex environmental stimuli in the field at the molecular level and how factors within the plant, such as the circadian clock and plant age, affect these responses. We focused on the transcriptome of rice (Oryza sativa), one of the most important crops for which a high-quality genome sequence (International Rice Genome Sequencing Project, 2005International Rice Genome Sequencing ProjectThe map-based sequence of the rice genome.Nature. 2005; 436: 793-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (2972) Google Scholar) and abundant genetic resources are available.

One of the major difficulties in analyzing data from field experiments is the complex and noisy character of various environmental factors; multiple factors that affect the transcriptome change simultaneously in the field. We employed a statistical modeling approach using a large collection of microarray and meteorological data to characterize the changes in transcriptome under natural field conditions (Figure 1A). This approach enabled us to dissect how transcriptomes are controlled by environmental stimuli in the field, as well as by the plant’s entrained circadian clock (which we have defined as a diurnal endogenous rhythm that determines phase and amplitude of an output gene constant among days during our sampling period) and the plant’s age (which we have defined as the number of days after transplanting). We first collected hundreds of mature leaves from rice plants growing in a paddy field (Tsukuba, Japan) during a normal agricultural season (from May to October in 2008). We used the youngest fully expanded leaf from one individual plant for microarray analysis. To build the model, we used 461 microarray data with distinct sampling time points (Figure 1B and Figure S1, Table S1, and Extended Experimental Procedures for sampling details available online) and the corresponding meteorological data (wind speed, air temperature, precipitation, global solar radiation, relative humidity, and atmospheric pressure) measured at 1 min intervals (Figure 1B). To evaluate the predictive performance of the model, we included 108 and 16 microarray data with distinct sampling time points from plants grown in the field in the 2009 and 2010 cultivation seasons, respectively, as well as 9 and 16 microarray data with distinct sampling time points from plants grown in light-controlled and temperature-controlled growth chambers, respectively (Table S1 and Figure S2).Figure S2Validation of Modeling Results, Related to Figure 2Show full caption(A) Summary of meteorological data and sampling time points at Tsukuba on May - Oct. in 2009.

Pearson’s correlation coefficient was used as the correlations. We independently modeled the transcriptional dynamics of each gene based on the framework of multiple linear regression. We assumed that the dynamics of a gene’s expression could be explained by the sum of the effects of the plant’s age (D), entrained circadian clock (C), environmental stimuli (E), and their interactions (D × C and D × E) (see Extended Experimental Procedures for detailed definitions of these terms and Figure S8). The term E is the cumulative sum of environmental stimuli and accounts for the diurnal change in sensitivity to these stimuli. Six meteorological data sets were considered as E, and one of them that best explained the expression dynamics of each gene was selected for the gene. In addition, the term “N8” representing differences between two rice cultivars used for microarray analysis, Nipponbare and Norin 8, was also included. We next determined the model structure (e.g., composition of the terms) for each gene in accordance with a statistical model selection procedure (see Extended Experimental Procedures and Figure S8). After trying to develop the models for all of the genes (27,201 genes), only genes that were expressed in the majority of samples (more than 80% among the 461 samples) and for which residuals from the corresponding model were normally distributed among the 461 samples were used to define a gene set for further analysis of the modeling results (Figures 1C and 1D). As a result, a total of 17,193 genes met both of these criteria and were used in subsequent analyses (Figure 1D). Among these 17,193 genes, the number of parameters for each gene varied from 3 to 17 (Figure 1E). Thus, models with no more than 17 parameters could account for the majority of the expression dynamics of these genes (Figures 1D and 1E). The number of genes differed dramatically among the model structures (Figure 1F). The distribution of R2 indicates that reasonable proportions of the transcriptome dynamics could be explained by the models and that the contributions of deterministic processes to the expression dynamics varied among the genes (Figure 1G). We concluded that our microarray data used for the modeling were enough to capture transcriptome dynamics under natural field conditions. Details of the modeling results for each gene are publicly available in the FiT (Field Transcriptome) database (http://fitdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/). Consider the following example: Os01g0182600 (OsGIGANTEA, OsGI) is a rice ortholog of GIGANTEA in Arabidopsis (Izawa et al., 2011Izawa T. Mihara M. Suzuki Y. Gupta M. Itoh H. Nagano A.J. Motoyama R. Sawada Y. Yano M. Hirai M.Y. et al.Os-GIGANTEA confers robust diurnal rhythms on the global transcriptome of rice in the field.Plant Cell. 2011; 23: 1741-1755Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). The expression of Os01g0182600 exhibits diurnal oscillation both under laboratory conditions (Itoh et al., 2010Itoh H. Nonoue Y. Yano M. Izawa T. A pair of floral regulators sets critical day length for Hd3a florigen expression in rice.Nat. Genet. 2010; 42: 635-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar) and in the field (Izawa et al., 2011Izawa T. Mihara M. Suzuki Y. Gupta M. Itoh H. Nagano A.J. Motoyama R. Sawada Y. Yano M. Hirai M.Y. et al.Os-GIGANTEA confers robust diurnal rhythms on the global transcriptome of rice in the field.Plant Cell. 2011; 23: 1741-1755Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Our model for Os01 g0182600 consisted of the terms for environmental stimuli (E) and genotype (N8) (Figure 2A). Cumulative values of temperature (w) higher than 14.8°C (th, threshold) for the past 371 min (pl, memory time period) were used as the effect of environmental stimuli (see the definitions of w, th, and pl in Extended Experimental Procedures and Figure S8). Here, the diurnal change of sensitivity to an environmental stimulus was designated as the “gate” (Itoh et al., 2010Itoh H. Nonoue Y. Yano M. Izawa T. A pair of floral regulators sets critical day length for Hd3a florigen expression in rice.Nat. Genet. 2010; 42: 635-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). To incorporate this concept in our models, we first defined three types of gate conditions (no gate, sine gate, or rectangular gate). In the models with no gate, there was no temporal change in the sensitivity to an environmental stimulus in a day. In the sine and rectangular gate models, the shape of the curve describing the diurnal changes in sensitivity resembled a sine curve and a rectangle, respectively. We chose the best gate model for a gene with the E term in its model in accordance with the statistical model selection procedure. For Os01g0182600, temperature with a rectangular gate was chosen for the model. The gate for Os01 g0182600 was open from 21.2 o’clock (∼21:12) (os, opening time) to 4.93 (∼4:56) o’clock (os + ol, the opening time plus the gate opening duration) (the units are hours). Thus, both temperature and circadian clock (which is required for the gate function) are necessary to explain the expression dynamics of Os01g0182600 in the field. The expression patterns of Os01 g0182600 expected by the model and corresponding microarray data in the field (2008) were strongly correlated (R2 = 0.958, n = 461, Figures 2B and 2C). Clear diurnal oscillations of Os01 g0182600 were found on any given day, but the amplitudes varied daily (Figure 2C). The model for Os01g0182600 explained the variation in the daily amplitudes well using the night temperature (Figure 2A). The model’s predictive performance was then evaluated using an independent data set that had not been used during the model development (Table S1 and Figures S2A–S2C). The predicted expression of Os01g0182600 based on the 2008 models agreed well with the observed expression in the field in 2009 (Figure 2D). Under the laboratory conditions, the prediction of Os01g0182600 agreed qualitatively with the observed expression, although the amplitude was overestimated (Figure S2D). The ability of the 2008 models to predict the entire transcriptome was next evaluated by calculating the correlations between the predicted transcriptome (17,193 genes) using the 2008 models with the environmental data, transplanting date, and transcriptome data of each sample in 2009 across all genes. The overall correlations of the 2009 samples were fairly high (generally r > 0.9 for 108 samples) and comparable to the correlations between the biological replicates in the microarray analysis (Figures 2E and 2F). Although the average daily temperature in 2010 was relatively higher than in 2008 (Figure 2G), the transcriptome correlations of field samples in 2010 were also high (generally r > 0.9 for 16 samples) (Figure 2F). Under the laboratory conditions (Figures S2B and S2C), the predictions and the observations were well correlated across the genes (Figure 2F), although they were lower than those obtained with the 2009 and 2010 field transcriptome data. In addition, under the laboratory conditions, there was a tendency for the models to overestimate the variation among samples (Figures S2D, S2F, and S2G). This tendency was weak and possibly nonexistent in the field data (Figure S2E). To evaluate the effects of the parameter (or term) on the predictive performance, we calculated the correlations of 108 samples in 2009 using genes with a specific parameter (or term) (Figures 2H and S2H). The correlations using only the genes with none and one of the terms for plant age (D), entrained circadian clock (C), and environmental stimuli (E) were comparable to those of all genes (Figure 2H). Next, we calculated the correlations using genes with one of the six meteorological parameters. For air temperature and solar radiation, the correlations were comparable to those of all genes (Figure 2H). However, for the other four meteorological parameters, the correlations were lower than those of all genes (Figure 2H). Thus, the predictive performances for the genes with one of these four meteorological parameters were lower than the other two. In addition, although we plotted the correlations against the month, time of day, plant age, and values of meteorological data (Figure S2H), we could not find any clear tendency, except that the predictive performance was lower for several samples in October (2009) than for other samples in August (2009). We also calculated the correlations using genes with distinct gate types only. All three groups of correlations were comparable to those of all genes (Figure 2H). These suggest that the predictive performances of our models may be low if we give environmental conditions beyond the physiological ranges of environmental changes used to develop the models. In addition, we may need both expressional and environmental data to develop better models for some stimuli. We performed further evaluation of the predictive performance using 16 samples obtained in 2010, in which the temperatures deviated from 2008 (Figure 2G). As mentioned above, the transcriptome correlations in 2010 were comparable to those in 2009 (Figure 2F). Thus, we here focused on temperature-responsive genes and examined the predictive performances for genes affected by temperature changes for around 1 day or longer memory time periods, as well as genes affected by relatively quick temperature changes. For genes affected by the “long” temperature changes for more than two-thirds of a day (∼1000 min) memory time periods (46 genes matched the following criteria: μ = α +β3E + γ1N8, w = temperature, β3 > 2, no gate, respond over th, pl > 1000 min), both the predictions in 2010 and the expectations in 2008 reflected cumulative sum of temperature over thresholds for two-thirds to 3 days. The observations matched the predictions according to the long-term temperature trends observed in 2010, although they were partially overestimated in some genes (Figure 2I). For genes affected by the “short” temperature changes for less than 6 hr (43 genes: μ = α +β3E + γ1N8, w = temperature, β3 > 1, no gate, respond over th, pl < 360 min), the observations again matched the predictions in 2010, although the daily differences were partially overestimated (Figure 2J). These two evaluations showed that our model worked well to predict the gene expression depending on the changes in temperature even if the temperatures deviate from those originally used to construct the models. As an independent validation of our 2008 models, we further examined the consistency between our models and genetic data on the effect of circadian clocks using a circadian clock mutant of rice (Izawa et al., 2011Izawa T. Mihara M. Suzuki Y. Gupta M. Itoh H. Nagano A.J. Motoyama R. Sawada Y. Yano M. Hirai M.Y. et al.Os-GIGANTEA confers robust diurnal rhythms on the global transcriptome of rice in the field.Plant Cell. 2011; 23: 1741-1755Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), which indicated a good performance of model selection in our 2008 models (see Extended Experimental Procedures for details). To reveal what controls the transcriptome in the field, we next examined the contribution of the terms. The terms for age (D), entrained circadian clock (C), and environmental stimuli (E) were used in the models for 8,151, 10,939, and 7,304 genes, respectively (Figure 3A). The resulting models showed that plant age, entrained circadian clock, and environmental stimuli were all widely involved in controlling transcriptome dynamics in the field. For quantitative comparison, we calculated, RdX2 wherein X represents a term such as C, E, or D for genes containing the X term. These measures likely reflect the contributions of the terms (see Extended Experimental Procedures for details on RdX2). Although the distributions of R2 among tested gene sets were similar to each other (Figure 3E), the distributions of RdX2 varied, thereby reflecting a significant contribution of X to the corresponding R2. Thus, the distributions of RdC2 (Figure 3D) showed that the entrained circadian clock (C) had the largest contribution accounting for gene expression in the field, at least in our data set. The extent to which circadian clocks contribute to plant transcriptomes under diurnal conditions, especially under fluctuating environments in nature, is still an open question. Many circadian clock mutants in Arabidopsis do not exhibit clear phenotypes (or changes of transcriptome) under diurnal conditions (Izawa, 2012Izawa T. Physiological significance of the plant circadian clock in natural field conditions.Plant Cell Environ. 2012; 35: 1729-1741Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). However, the impact of the C term in our models clearly suggests the importance of plant circadian clocks in natural diurnal conditions. Our recent work has also provided genetic evidence supporting this conclusion using a rice circadian clock mutant (Izawa et al., 2011Izawa T. Mihara M. Suzuki Y. Gupta M. Itoh H. Nagano A.J. Motoyama R. Sawada Y. Yano M. Hirai M.Y. et al.Os-GIGANTEA confers robust diurnal rhythms on the global transcriptome of rice in the field.Plant Cell. 2011; 23: 1741-1755Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). The distributions of RdD2 and RdE2 were similar, and RdD2 and RdE2 were often found at a lower range of values than that of RdC2 (Figure 3D). This means that the effect of age and the response to environments were comparable in terms of their impacts on transcriptome in the field. Because two interaction terms (DC and DE) were retained in the models for a small proportion of the genes (378 and 918, respectively; Figure 3A), the majority of gene expression for the entrained circadian clock (C) and for environmental stimuli (E) did not appear to depend on or interact with the plant age. The distributions of RdDC2 and RdDE2 showed that the interactions did not account much for the expression dynamics (Figure 3D). The remaining 3,098 genes did not fit the model with any terms of D, C, E, DC, or DE. These genes’ expression remain at a certain level at all times, independent of age, entrained circadian clock, and environmental stimuli, and are likely to be stably controlled during fluctuating environmental conditions in the field. We further analyzed the effects of meteorological data. In our models with E term, we selected a meteorological data set that best explained the expression dynamics for each gene. In this analysis, air temperature was most frequently selected (4,838 genes, 66% of genes with E term; Figure 3B). Solar radiation and relative humidity were chosen for 1,347 and 657 genes, respectively (Figure 3B). The other three data sets (wind speed, precipitation, and atmospheric pressure) were selected for fewer genes (197, 109, and 156 genes, respectively; Figure 3B). The distributions of RdE2 indicated a tendency for temperature and solar radiation to contribute more strongly than the other four meteorological parameters, although reasonable numbers of genes with the other parameters exhibited relatively large RdE2 values (Figure 3F). Thus, air temperature had the largest effect on the transcriptome dynamics among the six environmental stimuli, and solar radiation had the second-largest effect. The biological significance of the models with E for wind speed, atmospheric pressure, and precipitation should be carefully examined in future research (Figure 3F). For the gates, or the diurnal change of sensitivity to an environmental stimulus, the models with E (but no gate) were selected for 5,169 genes (Figure 3C). The sine and rectangular gate models were then selected for 689 and 1,446 genes, respectively (Figure 3C). Therefore, the responses to environmental stimuli were gated in ∼30% of the genes with E term. Although there was experimental evidence for the gate effects to given light environments (Itoh et al., 2010Itoh H. Nonoue Y. Yano M. Izawa T. A pair of floral regulators sets critical day length for Hd3a florigen expression in rice.Nat. Genet. 2010; 42: 635-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar), the predicted gate effects for other environmental stimuli remain to be proven experimentally. Because both light and temperature can entrain the circadian clocks, it is not surprising that temperature stimuli are gated to control genes related to circadian clocks. Our statistical modeling revealed several characteristics of the environmental response of each gene in the fie"

Upon the loss of the mitochondrial membrane potential, Parkin translocates to mitochondria in a PINK1-dependent manner to ubiquitinate mitochondrial proteins. Parkin-mediated polyubiquitination of outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM) proteins recruits the ubiquitin- and LC3-binding adaptor protein p62 to mitochondria and induces mitophagy.

Here, we demonstrate in human primary fibroblasts and induced pluripotent stem-derived neurons from controls and PINK1 mutation carriers that endogenous levels of Parkin are not sufficient to initiate mitophagy upon loss of the mitochondrial membrane potential, caused by its (self-)ubiquitination, followed by degradation via the ubiquitin proteasome system.

Following its mitochondrial translocation, Parkin induces polyubiquitination of the mitochondrial fusion proteins Mfn1 and Mfn2, followed by their degradation via the ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS) (10Tanaka A.

Although mitochondrial translocation to depolarized mitochondria and mitophagy has been clearly demonstrated in various non-neuronal cellular models, the results obtained from animal primary neurons are rather controversial (9Vives-Bauza C.

In the only published study on human neurons, i.e., induced pluripotent stem (iPS)-derived neurons, mitochondrial translocation of Parkin has been observed within 12 h upon mitochondrial depolarization (16Seibler P. Graziotto J. Jeong H. Simunovic F. Klein C. Krainc D. Mitochondrial Parkin recruitment is impaired in neurons derived from mutant PINK1 induced pluripotent stem cells.J.

It is important to bear in mind that the majority of these studies have been performed in cells overexpressing Parkin, which may result in artifacts per se. This idea is further supported by the observation that selected overexpressed pathogenic Parkin mutants retain their ability to translocate to damaged mitochondria (8Narendra D.P. Jin S.M. Tanaka A. Suen D.F. Gautier C.A. Shen J. Cookson M.R. Youle R.J. PINK1 is selectively stabilized on impaired mitochondria to activate Parkin.PLoS Biol. 2010; 8: e1000298Crossref PubMed Scopus (1992) Google Scholar) and even to induce mitophagy at a level similar to that overexpressed wild type Parkin (18Geisler S. Holmström K.M. Skujat D. Fiesel F.C. Rothfuss O.C. Kahle P.J. Springer W. PINK1/Parkin-mediated mitophagy is dependent on VDAC1 and p62/SQSTM1.Nat. Cell Biol. 2010; 12: 119-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (2029) Google Scholar). This prompted us, first, to study the process of mitophagy in cells expressing endogenous (“physiological”) levels of Parkin with those overexpressing it. The second aim of the present study was to investigate mitophagy in iPS-generated neurons from PINK1 mutants and controls, a model closely resembling the most relevant disease-affected tissue in PD. Human dermal fibroblasts from controls and a PD patient harboring a homozygous PINK1 missense mutation (V170G) and neuroblastoma (SH-SY5Y) cells were grown at 37 °C under a 5% CO2 humidified atmosphere in DMEM (PAA laboratories) supplemented with 10% FBS (PAA laboratories) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (PAA laboratories). The cells used in the present studies were between passages 4 and 12. Generation of iPS cells and their differentiation into dopaminergic neurons was carried out as previously published (16Seibler P. Graziotto J. Jeong H. Simunovic F. Klein C. Krainc D. Mitochondrial Parkin recruitment is impaired in neurons derived from mutant PINK1 induced pluripotent stem cells.J. Neurosci. 2011; 31: 5970-5976Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). Immunofluorescence staining showed that ∼70% of the total cells derived from iPS-Control and iPS-PINK1mut expressed the neuron-specific marker neuronal class III-Tubulin (TUJ1) (control, 72 ± 15%; PINK1mut, 76 ± 16%). The percentage of neurons coexpressing TUJ1 and tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) was similar between controls (11 ± 3%) and PINK1mut (10 ± 3%) iPS-derived neurons. Expression of TH was confirmed by Western blotting (see Fig. 9A). Mitochondria were isolated from fibroblasts and SH-SY5Y cells as described previously (17Almeida A. Medina J.M. Isolation and characterization of tightly coupled mitochondria from neurons and astrocytes in primary culture.Brain Res. 1997; 764: 167-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In brief, the cells were harvested and homogenized in buffer containing 250 mm sucrose, 10 mm Tris, and 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.4. Next, nuclei and intact cells were removed by centrifugation at 1500 × g for 20 min. The supernatant containing intact mitochondria was transferred into a new tube and centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 10 min. Supernatant (“cytosolic fraction”) was transferred into another new tube, and the mitochondria-enriched pellet (“mitochondrial fraction”) was dissolved in RIPA buffer containing a mixture of protease and phosphatase inhibitors (Roche Diagnostics). Cytoplasmic fractions were concentrated using Centricon YM-10 devices (Millipore) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Proteins of the mitochondrial and cytoplasmic fractions were separated by SDS-PAGE and detected by Western blot analysis using various antibodies. In this study we used the following antibodies: anti-β-actin (Sigma), anti-β-tubulin (Sigma), anti-Complex II Fp subunit (Mitosciences), F1F0ATPase (α subunit) (Mitosciences), anti-Grp75 (Abcam), anti-MT-CO2 (Mitosciences), anti-Mitofusin 1 (Abcam), anti-Mitofusin 2 (Abcam), anti-Parkin (Cell Signaling), anti-Parkin (Abcam), anti-Tom20 (Santa Cruz), anti-Tom40 (Santa Cruz), anti-Tom70 (Abcam), anti-TUJ1 (Covance), anti-TH (Calbiochem), anti-ubiquitin (Cell Signaling), anti-V5 (Invitrogen), and anti-VDAC1 (Abcam). To quantify band intensities of immunoblots, the TotalLab TL100 v2006 one-dimensional gel analysis software (Nonlinear Dynamics) was used. Fibroblasts and differentiated neurons stably expressing Parkin or/and MitoDsRed were grown on glass coverslips, fixed in 4% formaldehyde for 15 min, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100, and blocked in 4% normal goat serum in PBS for 1 h. Immunofluorescence staining was performed using primary antibodies against Parkin (1:200; Cell Signaling), TH (1:400; Calbiochem), and Grp75 (1:400; Abcam). Appropriate secondary antibodies were obtained from Invitrogen. To immunoprecipitate Parkin, cells overexpressing WT Parkin were lysed using 25 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, and 1% Nonidet P-40. Next 5 μl of an anti-Parkin antibody (Abcam) was bound with 50 μl of Dynabeads protein A (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Finally, cell lysates were mixed with antibody-conjugated Dynabeads. The resulting immunoprecipitates were separated by SDS-PAGE and detected by Western blot analysis using anti-Parkin (Cell Signaling) or anti-ubiquitin (Cell Signaling) antibodies. To measure MitoDsRed fluorescence, fibroblasts were grown in 96-well culture plates. Shortly before measurement, the cells were washed with PBS, and fluorescence was measured using a fluorescence plate reader (Biotek) with excitation/emission filters suitable for the red fluorescent MitoDsRed (530/590 nm). For evaluation of the mitochondrial mass, the cells were incubated with 150 nm MitoTracker Green FM (Molecular Probes) 30 min before measurement. The cells were washed with 1× PBS, and fluorescence was measured using a plate reader (Biotek; 490/516 nm). To construct the Mito-DsRed lentiviral expression plasmid, whole Mito-DsRed2 fragment was cloned from pDsRed2-Mito (Clontech) into a lentiviral pER4 vector resulting in pER4-Mito-DsRed. Lentiviral plasmids expressing PINK1-V5 (pER4-PINK1-V5) and Parkin (pER4-Parkin) have been described previously (16Seibler P. Graziotto J. Jeong H. Simunovic F. Klein C. Krainc D. Mitochondrial Parkin recruitment is impaired in neurons derived from mutant PINK1 induced pluripotent stem cells.J. Neurosci. 2011; 31: 5970-5976Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). For transient expression of Parkin, a mammalian expression vector pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) containing WT Parkin cDNA was used. Total RNA from fibroblasts was prepared by using the RNA easy protect kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions and then reverse-transcribed into cDNA with the SuperScript first strand synthesis system (Invitrogen). The resulting cDNAs were quantified by real time PCR using LightCycler DNA Master SYBR Green I on the Light Cycler 2.0 real time PCR system (Roche Diagnostics). Previous studies analyzing PINK1/Parkin-dependent removal of depolarized mitochondria by mitophagy mainly used cells overexpressing Parkin (8Narendra D.P. Jin S.M. Tanaka A. Suen D.F. Gautier C.A.

To study this process in primary human cells in a similar setting, we generated control and PINK1mut fibroblasts stably expressing C-terminally V5-tagged wild type PINK1 (PINK1-V5), wild type Parkin, or an empty expression vector using lentiviral particles. mRNA levels of PINK1 and Parkin were measured by real time PCR using the mRNA levels of β-actin for normalization. mRNA levels of overexpressed PINK1 or Parkin were comparable between controls and PINK1 mutants (∼250× higher in comparison with cells expressing endogenous PINK1 of Parkin; data not shown). In these cells, we first applied a routinely used method for mitochondrial labeling, i.e., Mito-DsRed labeling (19Greenwood S.M. Mizielinska S.M. Frenguelli B.G. Harvey J. Connolly C.N.

MTG is thought to stain lipids of both mitochondrial membranes, i.e., the outer and the inner membrane. On the other hand, Mito-DsRed is a fusion between red fluorescent protein (DsRed2) and the mitochondrial targeting sequence from subunit VIII of human cytochrome c oxidase localized exclusively in the inner mitochondrial membrane. Using both methods in parallel allowed us to monitor which one of the two mitochondrial membranes is affected by our treatments. In addition, it has been shown that Parkin modulates lipid metabolism (21Kim K.Y. Stevens M.V. Akter M.H. Rusk S.E. Huang R.J. Cohen A. Noguchi A. Springer D. Bocharov A.V. Eggerman T.L. Suen D.F.

Mitochondria labeled with Mito-DsRed completely colocalized with mitochondria stained with MTG (Fig. 1A), which has previously been used to measure mitochondrial mass of mitochondria (8Narendra D.P. Jin S.M. Tanaka A. Suen D.F. Gautier C.A. Shen J. Cookson M.R. Youle R.J.

Lemasters J.J. Tracker dyes to probe mitochondrial autophagy (mitophagy) in rat hepatocytes.Autophagy. 2006; 2: 39-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). For Mito-DsRed labeling, control and PINK1mut fibroblasts stably expressing empty vector, Parkin, or PINK1-V5 were transduced with lentiviral particles expressing Mito-DsRed to generate stable cell lines. Next, these cells were treated with valinomycin or with the commonly used mitochondrial depolarization agent carbonyl cyanide 4-(trifluoromethoxy) phenylhydrazone (FCCP) for 12 h, and DsRed fluorescence was measured. Here, we detected a decrease in DsRed-labeled mitochondria only in controls overexpressing Parkin but not in any other cells (Fig. 1B). To measure mitochondrial mass, control and PINK1mut fibroblasts stably expressing empty vector, Parkin, or PINK1-V5 were treated with valinomycin or with FCCP for 12 h followed by MTG staining. Only in controls overexpressing Parkin did we detect a decrease in mitochondrial mass upon either treatment (Fig. 1C). Next, we analyzed steady-state levels of proteins localized in different mitochondrial compartments, i.e., the OMM protein VDAC1, the inner mitochondrial membrane protein MT-CO2, the mitochondrial matrix protein Grp75 in controls, and PINK1mut stably expressing PINK1-V5, Parkin, or an empty vector. Note that Grp75 accumulates as a nonprocessed pre-protein (full-length, FL Grp75) (18Geisler S. Holmström K.M. Skujat D. Fiesel F.C. Rothfuss O.C. Kahle P.J. Springer W.

As in our previous experiment, we detected a significant decrease in levels of the mitochondrial proteins VDAC1, MT-CO2, and Grp75 only in control fibroblasts stably overexpressing Parkin when compared with levels of valinomycin- or FCCP-treated control cells expressing empty vector. In all other cells, no decrease in levels of these mitochondrial proteins was detected (Fig. 1D). In this experiment, endogenous Parkin is not detected because of a high dilution of the anti-Parkin antibody (2000× in comparison with the dilution necessary to detect endogenous Parkin). When using a less diluted anti-Parkin antibody, we detected both endogenous and overexpressed Parkin (data not shown). To confirm our findings in another cell line, we analyzed SH-SY5Y cells stably expressing empty vector, Parkin, or PINK1-V5 under basal conditions and upon treatment with valinomycin or with FCCP for 12 h. As in fibroblasts, we detected a significant decrease in levels of the mitochondrial proteins VDAC1, MT-CO2, and Grp75 only in cells overexpressing Parkin but not in those expressing endogenous level of Parkin or overexpressing PINK1 (Fig. 1E). Furthermore, we used immunostaining to show that only cells overexpressing Parkin are capable of removing mitochondria completely. For this, we transiently transfected fibroblasts from a control and a PINK1 mutant with empty vector or with vector expressing WT Parkin for 24 h. Upon transfection, the cells were treated with valinomycin for 16 h followed by immunostaining. In valinomycin-treated controls, we detected complete loss of the mitochondrial marker Grp75 (red) only in cells overexpressing Parkin (green, outlined cell), but not in those expressing endogenous levels of Parkin (Fig. 2A). In contrast, in PINKmut we detected no valinomycin-induced loss of Grp75 in cells with either endogenous or with overexpressed Parkin (Fig. 2B). We found that 79 ± 2% of control fibroblasts overexpressing Parkin displayed complete loss of mitochondria, whereas all other cells showed no loss of mitochondria (Fig. 2C). Note that all anti-Parkin antibodies we used were not sensitive enough to detect endogenous Parkin by immunostaining. Because we detected no reduction in levels of mitochondrial proteins in cells expressing only endogenous levels of Parkin in the first 12 h upon valinomycin- or FCCP-induced mitochondrial depolarization in our previous experiment (Fig. 1), we sought to analyze cells upon prolonged mitochondrial depolarization. First, we verified that human fibroblasts and SH-SY5Y cells express relatively high levels of endogenous Parkin compared with other commonly used human cell lines (Fig. 3A). Next, fibroblasts from a control and a PINK1 mutant (PINK1mut) were treated with valinomycin or FCCP for 12 and 24 h, respectively, followed by Western blot analysis of VDAC1, MT-CO2, Grp75, and Hsp60, another mitochondrial matrix protein. We detected comparable levels of all mitochondrial proteins tested upon 12 or 24 h of treatment with either valinomycin or FCCP in both controls and PINK1mut (Fig. 3, B and C). In addition, we measured steady-state levels of VDAC1, MT-CO2, and Grp75 in SH-SY5Y cells expressing endogenous levels of Parkin. Cells were analyzed under basal conditions and upon valinomycin or FCCP treatment for 12 and 24 h by Western blotting. Again, we detected no reduction in levels of any of the analyzed mitochondrial proteins (Fig. 3D). It is of note that FL Grp75 accumulates upon mitochondrial depolarization. Because endogenous Parkin is not sufficient to induce reduction in steady-state levels of mitochondrial proteins and mitochondrial mass measured by MTG, we next investigated whether protein levels of endogenous Parkin and its mitochondrial translocation might be affected in response to dissipation of the mitochondrial membrane potential. When we studied the effect of valinomycin or FCCP treatment on the total protein levels of endogenous Parkin using immunoblotting, we detected a loss of signal caused by either treatment only in controls but not in PINK1mut (Fig. 4A). Next, we analyzed the kinetics of the valinomycin-induced translocation of endogenous Parkin from the cytosol to mitochondria and monitored its proteins levels in each of those fractions. For this, fibroblasts from a control and PINK1mut were separated into mitochondrial and cytosolic fractions at different time points upon administration of valinomycin and analyzed by Western blotting (Fig. 4, B–E). In controls, Parkin translocated to mitochondria within 1 h of treatment followed by further mitochondrial accumulation until the ∼3-h time point. After this time point, the levels of mitochondrial Parkin started to continuously decrease, whereas the levels of all mitochondrial markers, VDAC1, MT-CO2, and Grp75, did not change during the entire experiment (Fig. 4B). In contrast, in the cytosolic fraction, we detected a continuous decrease in the levels of endogenous Parkin. Additionally, proteins from both fractions were immunoblotted using anti-Parkin antibody only (Fig. 4C) to avoid any possibility of cross-reaction with other antibodies used in Fig. 4B. In the cytosolic fraction, we saw additional Parkin antibody-immunoreactive bands of higher"

Using a murine forward genetic screen for novel determinants of axon guidance, we identified B3gnt1 and ISPD as required for the glycosylation of dystroglycan in vivo. Analysis of B3gnt1, ISPD, and dystroglycan mutant mice revealed a critical role for glycosylated dystroglycan in the development of several longitudinal axon tracts. Remarkably, the axonal guidance defects observed in B3gnt1, ISPD, and dystroglycan mutants resemble several of the axon guidance defects found in mice lacking the axon guidance cue Slit and its receptor Robo. This similarity is explained by our observations that dystroglycan binds directly to Slit and is required for proper Slit localization within the basement membrane and floor plate in vivo. These findings establish a novel role for glycosylated dystroglycan as a key determinant of axon guidance cue distribution and function in the mammalian nervous system."
https://openalex.org/W2092381624,"Reprogramming of somatic cells to a pluripotent state via expression of Oct4, Klf4, Myc, and Sox2 is a multistep process involving phased changes in gene expression. Here, we focus on the later stages of reprogramming, termed maturation and stabilization. We show that the stabilization phase and the acquisition of pluripotency are dependent on the removal of transgene expression late in the maturation phase. Clonal analysis of cells undergoing reprogramming revealed subsets of stabilization-competent (SC) and stabilization-incompetent (SI) cells. SC clones acquire a competency gene-expression signature late in the maturation phase. Functional analysis of SC signature genes identified enhancers of the transition to the stabilization phase and a distinct subset of genes required for the maintenance of pluripotency. Thus, the acquisition and maintenance of pluripotency are regulated by distinct molecular networks, and a specific regulatory program not previously implicated in reprogramming is required for the transition to transgene independence."
https://openalex.org/W2026355734,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are considered to be regulators of various biological processes in cancers, including the epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT), which is a key factor in cancer metastasis. In this study, we aimed to clarify the potential roles of miR-490-3p in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells. Using real-time quantitative RT-PCR, we discovered that miR-490-3p was up-regulated in HCC tissues and cells compared with the adjacent non-tumor tissues and normal cells. We also found that overexpression of miR-490-3p led to an increase in cell proliferation, migration, and invasion abilities and that it contributed to EMT. The inhibition of miR-490-3p had the opposite effect on the cells. We identified ERGIC3 (endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi intermediate compartment protein 3) as a direct target gene for miR-490-3p. Unlike most miRNA-mRNA interactions, miR-490-3p increased ERGIC3 mRNA and protein levels as well as the intensity of expression of the EGFP reporter gene controlled by the 3'-UTR of ERGIC3 mRNA. The up-regulation by miR-490-3p also required the participation of Ago2. The inhibition of miR-490-3p reduced the expression of ERGIC3. Overexpression of ERGIC3 led to the same effect on HCC cells as miR-490-3p overexpression, including EMT. Importantly, silencing ERGIC3 reversed the cellular responses mediated by miR-490-3p overexpression. In conclusion, our study indicated for the first time that miR-490-3p functioned like an oncogenic miRNA in HCC cells and that the inhibition of miR-490-3p might provide an potential treatment approach for HCC patients."

We have observed that cells lacking the tumor suppressor p27 can be reprogrammed into induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) in the absence of ectopic Sox2.

Furthermore, p27 null iPSCs fail to fully repress Sox2 upon differentiation. Mechanistically, we have found that upon differentiation p27 associates to the SRR2 enhancer of the Sox2 gene together with a p130-E2F4-SIN3A repressive complex. Finally, Sox2 haploinsufficiency genetically rescues some of the phenotypes characteristic of p27 null mice, including gigantism, pituitary hyperplasia, pituitary tumors, and retinal defects.

In the context of investigating the role of tumor suppressors during reprogramming, we studied p27 null cells and we noticed that these cells can be reprogrammed into iPSCs without ectopic expression of Sox2. This observation led us to explore the potential link between these two previously unrelated proteins, p27 and SOX2. While investigating the effect of tumor suppressor genes on the process of reprogramming to induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) by the three Yamanaka factors (Oct4, Klf4, and Sox2) (Takahashi and Yamanaka, 2006Takahashi K. Yamanaka S. Induction of pluripotent stem cells from mouse embryonic and adult fibroblast cultures by defined factors.Cell. 2006; 126: 663-676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18861) Google Scholar), we tested the three possible combinations of two factors (abbreviated as 2F-OK, 2F-OS, and 2F-KS in reference to Oct4, Klf4, and Sox2) in a series of primary mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs) lacking cell cycle regulators and tumor suppressors. After repeated attempts, we were unable to obtain alkaline-phosphatase-positive (AP+) colonies in any of the tested MEFs using 2F-OS or 2F-KS. Interestingly, however, p27 null MEFs and, to a lesser extent, p130 null MEFs gave rise to AP+ colonies with 2F-OK (Figures 1A and 1B ). Absence of the p27-related protein p21 also produced AP+ colonies and further increased the number of AP+ colonies when combined with p27 deficiency, thus suggesting some degree of functional redundancy between p27 and p21. In all these MEFs, the emergence of visible AP+ colonies was delayed compared to the standard three-factor cocktail (3F-OKS) (4 weeks versus 2 weeks) and the average efficiency was about 100-fold lower (9 × 10−5 in p27 null/2F-OK versus 8 × 10−3 in WT/3F-OKS). In contrast to this, WT MEFs or MEFs deficient in p53, Arf, or Ink4a/Arf could not be reprogrammed by 2F-OK despite the fact that these cells are reprogrammed with very high efficiency by 3F-OKS (Banito et al., 2009Banito A.

Also, absence of p27 had a modest stimulatory effect on 3F-OKS reprogramming (Figure S1A available online). Together, these observations suggest that the absence of p27 selectively renders cells susceptible to reprogramming in the absence of ectopic Sox2. The p27 null/2F-OK AP+ colonies were confirmed to be bona fide iPSCs based on their expression of endogenous pluripotency genes (Nanog, Sox2, and Oct4; Figure S1B), production of teratomas (Figure S1C), and efficient contribution to chimeric mice (Figure 1C). To further validate the use of alkaline phosphatase as a marker of reprogramming under our experimental conditions (most notably characterized by the absence of ectopic c-Myc and by the use of serum-free medium), we obtained WT and p27 null MEFs carrying a transgenic GFP reporter under the Sox2 promoter (D'Amour and Gage, 2003D'Amour K.A. Gage F.H. Genetic and functional differences between multipotent neural and pluripotent embryonic stem cells.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2003; 100: 11866-11872Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar), and we observed that >90% of the AP+ colonies were GFP+. All together, these results indicate that the absence of p27 eliminates the absolute requirement for ectopic Sox2 in reprogramming. Mouse fibroblasts express low, but detectable, levels of Sox2 (Eminli et al., 2008Eminli S. Utikal J. Arnold K. Jaenisch R. Hochedlinger K. Reprogramming of neural progenitor cells into induced pluripotent stem cells in the absence of exogenous Sox2 expression.Stem Cells. 2008; 26: 2467-2474Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar), and therefore, we wondered whether p27 deficiency affected Sox2 expression. Indeed, p27 null MEFs had a significant increase in Sox2 mRNA levels compared to WT controls (7-fold), although these levels were still about 64-fold lower than in embryonic stem cells (ESCs) (Figure 1D). We also detected SOX2 protein by immunofluorescence. Consistent with the mRNA data, quantitative image analyses indicated that SOX2 protein levels were globally increased in p27 null MEFs (Figure 1E). Of note, the distribution of SOX2 fluorescence intensity in p27 null MEFs is broad, and therefore, it is conceivable that only those p27 null cells with the highest SOX2 levels are the ones susceptible of 2F-OK reprogramming. It is also worth mentioning that WT and p27 null MEFs have the same proliferative rate (Coats et al., 1999Coats S. Whyte P. Fero M.L. Lacy S. Chung G. Randel E. Firpo E. Roberts J.M. A new pathway for mitogen-dependent cdk2 regulation uncovered in p27(Kip1)-deficient cells.Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 163-173Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), thus implying that their different SOX2 levels are not secondary to a different proliferative activity. We tested whether the increased levels of SOX2 observed in p27 null MEFs could be reverted by ectopic overexpression of p27. Interestingly, quantitative immunofluorescence of p27-overexpressing p27 null MEFs indicated a downregulation of SOX2 levels (Figure 1E). Finally, we also observed higher Sox2 mRNA levels in the retina, brain, and lung of adult p27 null mice (Figure 1F). Together, these data indicate that p27 contributes to the silencing of Sox2 in differentiated cells and tissues. To further define the repressive role of p27 on Sox2, we analyzed the differentiation of pluripotent stem cells upon treatment with retinoic acid (RA). This differentiation protocol efficiently reduces SOX2 protein and mRNA concomitantly with a dramatic upregulation of p27 (Figure S2A). The upregulation of p27 during RA-induced differentiation is in agreement with a previous report on differentiating human embryonic carcinoma cells (Bahrami et al., 2005Bahrami A.R. Matin M.M. Andrews P.W. The CDK inhibitor p27 enhances neural differentiation in pluripotent NTERA2 human EC cells, but does not permit differentiation of 2102Ep nullipotent human EC cells.Mech. Dev. 2005; 122: 1034-1042Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). We wondered whether the absence of p27 would affect the kinetics of Sox2 repression. For this, we generated iPSCs derived from WT or p27 null MEFs after reprogramming them with Oct4, Klf4, and Sox2. The levels of Sox2 mRNA were similar in undifferentiated WT or p27 null iPSCs (Figure 2A). However, upon RA-induced differentiation, Sox2 levels in p27 null iPSCs were not reduced as efficiently as in WT iPSCs (Figure 2A). Similarly, we tested Sox2 expression during iPSC differentiation into embryoid bodies (EBs). Again, Sox2 mRNA levels were abnormally high in p27-deficient EBs compared to WT ones (Figure 2B). These observations are in agreement with a previous study reporting numerous abnormalities in EBs from p27 null ESCs (Bryja et al., 2005Bryja V. Cajánek L. Pacherník J. Hall A.C. Horváth V. Dvorák P. Hampl A. Abnormal development of mouse embryoid bodies lacking p27Kip1 cell cycle regulator.Stem Cells. 2005; 23: 965-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). We considered the possibility that the increased Sox2 levels in p27 null EBs could reflect a skewed neural differentiation, but the levels of Nestin mRNA were similar in WT and p27 null EBs (Figure S2B). To directly test the repressive activity of p27, we retrovirally transduced ESCs with a pMSCV vector expressing p27, and interestingly, p27 overexpression was able to reduce the levels of Sox2 to an extent comparable to RA (Figure 2C). Previous studies have demonstrated that Sox2 null ESCs spontaneously differentiate into trophectoderm-like cells (Masui et al., 2007Masui S. Nakatake Y. Toyooka Y. Shimosato D. Yagi R. Takahashi K. Okochi H. Okuda A. Matoba R. Sharov A.A. et al.Pluripotency governed by Sox2 via regulation of Oct3/4 expression in mouse embryonic stem cells.Nat. Cell Biol. 2007; 9: 625-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (886) Google Scholar). We asked whether p27 overexpression in ESCs promotes the trophectoderm-like differentiation characteristic of Sox2 null ESCs. Indeed, this was the case and p27 overexpression selectively induced trophectoderm markers to a similar extent as RA differentiation, whereas ectoderm, endoderm, and mesoderm markers were not induced by p27 but were induced by RA (Figure 2C). Moreover, p27-overexpressing ESCs produced cells with giant trophoblast-like morphology, while this type of cell was absent in RA-differentiated ESCs (Figure S2C). To extend the generality of these findings to other pluripotent cells, we overexpressed p27 in murine P19 embryonal carcinoma (P19EC) cells at levels that did not affect proliferation and found a significant decrease of Sox2 mRNA levels (Figure S2D). Together, these results indicate that p27 exerts a repressive effect on Sox2 that is relevant during differentiation. The main regulatory element responsible for the expression of Sox2 in pluripotent stem cells is located ∼4 kb downstream of the single Sox2 coding exon and it is named SRR2 (Sikorska et al., 2008Sikorska M. Sandhu J.K. Deb-Rinker P. Jezierski A. Leblanc J. Charlebois C. Ribecco-Lutkiewicz M. Bani-Yaghoub M. Walker P.R.

Identification of Sox-2 regulatory region which is under the control of Oct-3/4-Sox-2 complex.Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 3202-3213Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Based on our above observations in MEFs and in differentiating pluripotent cells, we asked whether the presence or absence of p27 had an effect on the repressive epigenetic marks on the Sox2-SRR2 enhancer. Interestingly, we observed that p27 null MEFs present lower levels of the H3K9me3 and H3K27me3 repressive marks at the Sox2-SRR2 enhancer as evidenced by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analysis (Figure 3A). Similarly, RA-induced differentiation of WT iPSCs dramatically increased the levels of H3K9me3 and H3K27me3 at the Sox2-SRR2 enhancer, while these epigenetic marks were modestly increased in p27 null iPSCs (Figure 3B). These results indicate that the absence of p27 leads to a defective epigenetic remodeling of the Sox2-SRR2 enhancer both in differentiated cells (MEFs) and during the differentiation of pluripotent cells. Based on the above data and the recent report that p27 can associate to gene promoters in association with the repressive complex p130-E2F4-SIN3A (Pippa et al., 2012Pippa R. Espinosa L. Gundem G. García-Escudero R. Dominguez A. Orlando S. Gallastegui E. Saiz C. Besson A. Pujol M.J. et al.p27(Kip1) represses transcription by direct interaction with p130/E2F4 at the promoters of target genes.Oncogene. 2012; 31: 4207-4220Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that p27 might be recruited in this manner to the Sox2-SRR2 enhancer. To directly test this, we performed ChIP with anti-p27 antibodies in MEFs and we detected p27 associated to the Sox2-SRR2 enhancer (Figure 3C). As before, we wondered whether this was also the case in differentiating pluripotent cells. Interestingly, RA-induced differentiation of iPSCs was accompanied by a strong recruitment of p27 to the Sox2-SRR2 enhancer (Figure 3C). To further extend these observations, we used ESCs and, as in the case of iPSCs, p27 was immunoprecipated at the Sox2-SRR2 enhancer upon RA-induced differentiation, but not at the Nanog promoter used here as a control (Figure 3D). We sought additional proof by performing ChIP from ESCs transfected with flag-tagged p27 and we also found p27 bound to the Sox2-SRR2 enhancer after immunoprecipitation with antibodies against p27 or against the flag tag (Figure 3E). Similar results were obtained in P19EC cells, both upon RA-induced differentiation (Figure S3A) and upon transfection of flag-tagged p27 (Figure S3B). To examine the presence of a p130-E2F4-SIN3A repressive complex at the Sox2-SRR2 enhancer, we performed ChIP assays using antibodies against p130, E2F4, and SIN3A in WT or p27 null iPSCs undergoing RA-induced differentiation. Interestingly, the three proteins were detected in the Sox2-SRR2 enhancer of RA-differentiated cells regardless of the presence or absence of p27 (Figure 3F). We also detected binding of p130, E2F4, and SIN3A to the Sox2-SRR2 enhancer in WT and p27 null MEFs (Figure S3C) and RA-differentiated P19EC cells (Figure S3D). These results indicate that a repressive p130-E2F4-SIN3A complex is assembled at the Sox2-SRR2 enhancer upon differentiation and independently of p27. Finally, we asked whether the direct inhibition of the p130-E2F4-SIN3A complex would also result in derepression of Sox2. In agreement with previous reports (Dannenberg et al., 2005Dannenberg J.H. David G. Zhong S. van der Torre J. Wong W.H. Depinho R.A. mSin3A corepressor regulates diverse transcriptional networks governing normal and neoplastic growth and survival.Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 1581-1595Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar), depletion of SIN3A had a dramatic effect on cell viability that precluded us from further examining the effect on Sox2 expression. Interestingly, however, knockdown of p130 or E2f4 with shRNAs resulted in a severe reduction of their expression (Figure S3E) and, importantly, this was accompanied in both cases by a significant upregulation of Sox2 expression (Figure 3G). In summary, we conclude that p27 associates to the Sox2-SRR2 enhancer together with the repressive complex p130-E2F4-SIN3A, and together contribute to the repression of Sox2 upon cell differentiation. Based on our above data, we wondered whether the incomplete repression of Sox2 observed in p27-deficient cells and tissues could mediate some of the phenotypes characteristic of p27 null mice. To evaluate this in a genetic manner, we generated compound Sox2 heterozygous (Sox2-het) and p27 null mice. Sox2 null mice are not viable, but Sox2-het are viable and display a moderate reduction in body size and hypopituitarism (Kelberman et al., 2006Kelberman D. Rizzoti K. Avilion A. Bitner-Glindzicz M. Cianfarani S. Collins J. Chong W.K. Kirk J.M. Achermann J.C. Ross R. et al.Mutations within Sox2/SOX2 are associated with abnormalities in the hypothalamo-pituitary-gonadal axis in mice and humans.J. Clin. Invest. 2006; 116: 2442-2455PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, the characteristic gigantism of p27 null mice was normalized by deletion of one Sox2 allele (Figure 4A; Figure S4A), as was also the case for the pituitary mass in young 3- to 6-month-old mice (at this age, p27 null mice present pituitary hyperplasia, but do not have pituitary tumors yet) (Figure 4B). However, given the fact that Sox2-het mice have a modest, but detectable, defect in growth, the above results leave open the possibility that p27 and Sox2 simply have opposite effects on growth that balance each other. For this reason, we decided to focus in the progenitor cell layer that surrounds the pituitary cleft and which is formed by SOX2-positive (SOX2+) cells (Fauquier et al., 2008Fauquier T. Rizzoti K. Dattani M. Lovell-Badge R. Robinson I.C. SOX2-expressing progenitor cells generate all of the major cell types in the adult mouse pituitary gland.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

USA. 2008; 105: 6332-6337Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). The progenitor layer in Sox2-het pituitaries had the same thickness as in WT pituitaries (Figures 4C and 4D; Figure S4B). Interestingly, the thickness of the progenitor layer was significantly increased in p27 null mice compared to WT or to Sox2-het mice, and this defect was absent in Sox2-het/p27-null mice (Figures 4C and 4D). The progenitor cells of the pituitary have been proposed to constitute the origin of pituitary adenomas (Gleiberman et al., 2008Gleiberman A.S. Michurina T. Encinas J.M. Roig J.L. Krasnov P. Balordi F. Fishell G. Rosenfeld M.G. Enikolopov G. Genetic approaches identify adult pituitary stem cells.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2008; 105: 6332-6337Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). In this regard and in line with our above observations, the incidence of pituitary tumors was significantly reduced in Sox2-het/p27-null mice compared to p27 null littermates (Figure 4E). Having established that Sox2 heterozygosity rescues the gigantism and the pituitary phenotypes of p27 null mice, we wondered whether the same was true for the retinal defects of p27 null mice. In agreement with previous reports, the retinas of Sox2-het mice were normal (Taranova et al., 2006Taranova O.V. Magness S.T. Fagan B.M. Wu Y. Surzenko N. Hutton S.R. Pevny L.H. SOX2 is a dose-dependent regulator of retinal neural progenitor competence.Genes Dev. 2006; 20: 1187-1202Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar) (Figure S4C), while p27 null retinas presented focal protrusions of the outer nuclear layer (ONL) (Nakayama et al., 1996Nakayama K. Ishida N. Shirane M. Inomata A. Inoue T. Shishido N. Horii I. Loh D.Y. Nakayama K. Mice lacking p27(Kip1) display increased body size, multiple organ hyperplasia, retinal dysplasia, and pituitary tumors.Cell. 1996; 85: 707-720Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1468) Google Scholar) (Figures 4F and 4G). Interestingly, these protrusions were absent in Sox2-het/p27-null retinas (Figures 4F and 4G). Also, we observed that p27 null retinas present an increased abundance of SOX2+ nuclei at the inner nuclear layer (INL) and mislocalized SOX2+ nuclei in the outer plexiform layer (OPL) (Figure S4C). We quantified the number of SOX2+ nuclei in complete retinal sections and confirmed that p27 null retinas present an excess of SOX2+ nuclei and, importantly, we found that this defect was absent in Sox2-het/p27-null retinas (Figure 4H). We wanted to corroborate the increased abundance of SOX2+ nuclei in the absence of p27, and for this we used transgenic mice with GFP under the control of a Sox2 promoter region that marks neural multipotent progenitors associated to Sox2 expression (Sox2-GFP mice) (D'Amour and Gage, 2003D'Amour K.A. Gage F.H. Genetic and functional differences between multipotent neural and pluripotent embryonic stem cells.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2003; 100: 11866-11872Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Reinforcing our above observations, p27-het/Sox2-GFP retinas presented a significant increase in GFP+ nuclei when compared with WT/Sox2-GFP retinas (Figure S4D). Together, we conclude that a decrease in the gene dosage of Sox2 rescues the main phenotypes associated with p27 deficiency, namely, gigantism, pituitary hyperplasia, pituitary adenomas, and retinal abnormalities. In addition to these phenotypes, p27 null mice also have adrenal gland hyperplasias and tumors (pheochromocytomas) and female sterility (Fero et al., 1996Fero M.L. Rivkin M. Tasch M. Porter P. Carow C.E. Firpo E. Polyak K. Tsai L.H. Broudy V.

Mice lacking p27(Kip1) display increased body size, multiple organ hyperplasia, retinal dysplasia, and pituitary tumors.Cell. 1996; 85: 707-720Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1468) Google Scholar). We examined WT adrenal glands and p27 null pheochromocytomas by immunostaining for SOX2, but they were negative and for this reason we did not further pursue this phenotype. Regarding the sterility of p27 null females, Sox2-het/p27-null females remained sterile, suggesting that this phenotype is independent of Sox2. Collectively, these results provide genetic support to the concept that p27 is a negative regulator of Sox2 in the pituitary and in the retina. The mechanisms responsible for the transcriptional silencing of pluripotency genes in differentiated cells are poorly understood. The results reported here demonstrate that the tumor suppressor p27 contributes to the transcriptional repression of Sox2. We have observed that the absence of p27 leads to a defective repression of Sox2 in fibroblasts, lung, retina, and brain, and to a delayed and incomplete silencing of Sox2 during differentiation of pluripotent cells, including iPSCs, ESCs, and P19EC cells. These observations led us to identify p27 as a transcriptional regulator of Sox2 together with a repressive complex formed by p130, E2F4, and SIN3A at a critical enhancer responsible for Sox2 expression. These findings are in line with a recent report describing the capacity of p27 to interact with the p130/E2F4/SIN3A complex and contribute to its transcriptional repressive activity (Pippa et al., 2012Pippa R. Espinosa L. Gundem G. García-Escudero R. Dominguez A. Orlando S. Gallastegui E. Saiz C. Besson A. Pujol M.J. et al.p27(Kip1) represses transcription by direct interaction with p130/E2F4 at the promoters of target genes.Oncogene. 2012; 31: 4207-4220Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). We have found that p27 deficiency leads to an expansion of SOX2+ cells in the progenitor layer of the pituitary and in the retina, which results in pituitary hyperplasia and tumors and morphological defects of the retina. Importantly, these defects are rescued when p27 deficiency is combined with Sox2 heterozygosity. In humans, germline mutations in p27 and SOX2 also affect the pituitary and the retina. On one hand, loss-of-function mutations in p27 produce MEN syndrome, notably characterized by pituitary tumors (Marinoni and Pellegata, 2011Marinoni I.

On the other hand, loss-of-function mutations in SOX2 produce syndromes characterized by anophthalmia and hypopituitarism (Engelen et al., 2011Engelen E. Akinci U. Bryne J.C. Hou J. Gontan C. Moen M.

All comparisons were made among mice derived from the same sets of crosses, and they therefore shared the same genetic background. Animal experimentation at the CNIO, Madrid was performed according to protocols approved by the CNIO-ISCIII Ethics Committee for Research and Animal Welfare (CEIyBA) and animal experimentation at the MRC-NIMR, Mill Hill, London was carried out in accordance with the UK Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986.

ESCs or iPSCs were adapted to grow on gelatin-coated plates (and in the absence of feeder cells). Cells were grown to near confluency in their corresponding complete medium (day 0) and then were trypsinized and seeded at lower density in the absence of LIF for 1 day (day 1). During the following 2 days (days 2 and 3), RA was added at a concentration of 10−6 M, and day 4 cells were without LIF and without RA. In the case of P19EC cells, differentiation was induced by addition of RA (10−6 M) for 4 days. For immunohistochemical stainings, quantifications were performed on representative fields at the same magnification, on a minimum of three different areas per sample and a minimum of three different samples per genotype. For immunofluorescence, cells were inspected under a Leica TCS-SP5 confocal microscope (AOBS) and analyzed using Definiens Developer XD 1.5 software, under the same exposure conditions.

In Oxytricha, the somatic genome is responsible for vegetative growth, whereas the germline contributes DNA to the next sexual generation. Somatic nuclear development removes all transposons and other so-called ""junk"" DNA, which comprise ~95% of the germline. We demonstrate that Piwi-interacting small RNAs (piRNAs) from the maternal nucleus can specify genomic regions for retention in this process. Oxytricha piRNAs map primarily to the somatic genome, representing the ~5% of the germline that is retained. Furthermore, injection of synthetic piRNAs corresponding to normally deleted regions leads to their retention in later generations. Our findings highlight small RNAs as powerful transgenerational carriers of epigenetic information for genome programming."

Among the KIF5s, KIF5A is neuron specific and highly expressed in the central nervous system. However, the specific roles of KIF5A remain unknown. Here, we established conditional Kif5a-knockout mice in which KIF5A protein expression was postnatally suppressed in neurons. Epileptic phenotypes were observed by electroencephalogram abnormalities in knockout mice because of impaired GABA(A) receptor (GABA(A)R)-mediated synaptic transmission. We also identified reduced cell surface expression of GABA(A)R in knockout neurons. Importantly, we identified that KIF5A specifically interacted with GABA(A)R-associated protein (GABARAP) that is known to be involved in GABA(A)R trafficking. KIF5A regulated neuronal surface expression of GABA(A)Rs via an interaction with GABARAP. These results provide an insight into the molecular mechanisms of KIF5A, which regulate inhibitory neural transmission."
https://openalex.org/W2159893325,"In budding yeast, the essential functions of Hsp70 chaperones Ssa1–4 are regulated through expression level, isoform specificity, and cochaperone activity. Suggesting a novel regulatory paradigm, we find that phosphorylation of Ssa1 T36 within a cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) consensus site conserved among Hsp70 proteins alters cochaperone and client interactions. T36 phosphorylation triggers displacement of Ydj1, allowing Ssa1 to bind the G1 cyclin Cln3 and promote its degradation. The stress CDK Pho85 phosphorylates T36 upon nitrogen starvation or pheromone stimulation, destabilizing Cln3 to delay onset of S phase. In turn, the mitotic CDK Cdk1 phosphorylates T36 to block Cln3 accumulation in G2/M. Suggesting broad conservation from yeast to human, CDK-dependent phosphorylation of Hsc70 T38 similarly regulates Cyclin D1 binding and stability. These results establish an active role for Hsp70 chaperones as signal transducers mediating growth control of G1 cyclin abundance and activity."

Here, we show how optogenetic inactivation of superior colliculus neurons in awake monkeys leads to clear and repeatable behavioral deficits in the metrics of saccadic eye movements. We used our observations to evaluate principles governing the use of optogenetic techniques in the study of the neuronal bases of behavior in monkeys, particularly how experimental design must address relevant parameters, such as the application of light to subcortical structures, the spread of viral injections, and the extent of neuronal inactivation with light."
https://openalex.org/W2033309880,"There are at least five families of microbe-detection receptors that function to detect and eradicate potentially infectious microorganisms that enter multicellular eukaryotes. While a multitude of proteins regulating innate immune signal transduction have already been defined, continuous genetic screening for regulators of innate immunity may not yield as significant insight into the operation of these pathways as was obtained in the past. This diminished return on experimental investment suggests that we are approaching the asymptote of genetics-only approaches to study innate immunity. In contrast, it remains unclear how known regulators of innate immunity interact within the infrastructure of mammalian cells to execute their signaling functions. In this Perspective, I first highlight the locations within mammalian cells that permit innate immune signal transduction and then offer a model whereby structurally distinct proteins can be grouped functionally through their ability to assemble platforms of regulators on the signaling organelles of the innate immune system."

https://openalex.org/W2153377288,"Deregulated cell survival under carcinogen-induced genotoxic stress is vital for cancer development. One of the cellular processes critical for cell survival under metabolic stress and energy starvation is autophagy, a catabolic process involved in capture and delivery of cytoplasmic components to lysosomes for degradation. However, the role of autophagy following carcinogen-induced genotoxic stress remains unclear. Here we show that UVB radiation, a known human skin carcinogen that operates by causing DNA damage, induced autophagy and autophagic flux through AMP kinase activation. Autophagy deficiency sensitizes cells to UVB-induced apoptosis through increasing p62-dependent activation of the stress-activated protein kinase p38. Compared with normal human skin, autophagy was activated in human squamous cell carcinomas, in association with decreased phosphorylation of p38, and increased phosphorylation of ATR and formation of γ-H2AX, two markers of DNA damage response. Our results demonstrate that autophagy promotes cell survival through suppressing p62-mediated p38 activation and thus may facilitate tumor development under genotoxic stress. These findings suggest that autophagy plays an oncogenic role in epithelial carcinogenesis by promoting cell survival."
https://openalex.org/W2082545989,"Postrhinal cortex, rodent homolog of the primate parahippocampal cortex, processes spatial and contextual information. Our hypothesis of postrhinal function is that it serves to encode context, in part, by forming representations that link objects to places. To test this hypothesis, we recorded postrhinal neurons and local field potentials (LFPs) in rats trained on a two-choice, visual discrimination task. As predicted, many postrhinal neurons signaled object-location conjunctions. Another large proportion encoded egocentric motor responses. In addition, postrhinal LFPs exhibited strong oscillatory rhythms in the theta band, and many postrhinal neurons were phase locked to theta. Although correlated with running speed, theta power was lower than predicted by speed alone immediately before and after choice. However, theta power was significantly increased following incorrect decisions, suggesting a role in signaling error. These findings provide evidence that postrhinal cortex encodes representations that link objects to places and suggest postrhinal theta modulation extends to cognitive as well as spatial functions. Postrhinal cortex, rodent homolog of the primate parahippocampal cortex, processes spatial and contextual information. Our hypothesis of postrhinal function is that it serves to encode context, in part, by forming representations that link objects to places. To test this hypothesis, we recorded postrhinal neurons and local field potentials (LFPs) in rats trained on a two-choice, visual discrimination task. As predicted, many postrhinal neurons signaled object-location conjunctions. Another large proportion encoded egocentric motor responses. In addition, postrhinal LFPs exhibited strong oscillatory rhythms in the theta band, and many postrhinal neurons were phase locked to theta. Although correlated with running speed, theta power was lower than predicted by speed alone immediately before and after choice. However, theta power was significantly increased following incorrect decisions, suggesting a role in signaling error. These findings provide evidence that postrhinal cortex encodes representations that link objects to places and suggest postrhinal theta modulation extends to cognitive as well as spatial functions. Postrhinal cells encode representations that link objects to places Postrhinal neuronal activity correlates with egocentric motor responses Theta power in postrhinal cortex correlates with running speed, task phase, and decision outcome A substantial proportion of postrhinal neurons are phase locked to theta The predominant view of medial temporal lobe function emphasizes that spatial and nonspatial information reach the hippocampus through segregated parahippocampal pathways (e.g., Eichenbaum et al., 2007Eichenbaum H.

Hippocampal place cells: parallel input streams, subregional processing, and implications for episodic memory.Hippocampus. 2006; 16: 755-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Spatial and contextual information is conveyed to the hippocampus by the postrhinal (POR) cortex (parahippocampal cortex [PHC] in the primate brain) and the medial entorhinal cortex (MEC), whereas nonspatial information is conveyed by the perirhinal cortex (PER) and the lateral entorhinal cortex (LEC). These two pathways, however, are not completely segregated. For example, intrinsic entorhinal connections span the LEC and MEC in both rats and monkeys (Chrobak and Amaral, 2007Chrobak J.J.

Entorhinal cortex of the rat: organization of intrinsic connections.J. Comp. Neurol. 1998; 398: 49-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). In addition, in both species, the PER located in the nonspatial pathway is reciprocally connected with the POR/PHC in the spatial pathway (Burwell and Amaral, 1998bBurwell R.D. Amaral D.G.

Given the anatomical evidence for nonspatial input to the spatial pathway, it is not surprising that the PHC is implicated in a variety of higher-order cognitive functions, some of which are not strictly limited to the spatial domain. These functions include visual scene processing (Epstein et al., 1999Epstein R. Harris A. Stanley D. Kanwisher N.

Evidence from neuroimaging studies suggests that activity in the PHC increases when individuals are presented with objects that have strong contextual associations (Aminoff et al., 2007Aminoff E.

In addition, Mullally and Maguire, 2011Mullally S.L. Maguire E.A. A new role for the parahippocampal cortex in representing space.J. Neurosci. 2011; 31: 7441-7449Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar provided evidence that the PHC is more active in response to objects that are larger and stationary (spatially defining) as opposed to objects that are smaller and more portable (spatially ambiguous). Results of experimental lesion studies in rats also suggest that the POR processes information about objects, especially with respect to place or context (Gaffan et al., 2004Gaffan E.A. Healey A.N. Eacott M.J. Objects and positions in visual scenes: effects of perirhinal and postrhinal cortex lesions in the rat.Behav.

Neurosci. 2005; 119: 557-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Based on the above review, a reasonable hypothesis is that the POR and PHC represent contexts and scenes, in part, by encoding the spatial layout of objects in the local environment. To test this hypothesis, we recorded from POR neurons during performance on a visual discrimination task in which rats learned object discriminations in multiple places (Figure 1). Stimuli were pairs of two-dimensional (2D) objects back-projected onto the floor of a bow-tie shaped testing area in a novel apparatus, the floor projection maze (Furtak et al., 2009Furtak S.C. Cho C.E. Kerr K.M. Barredo J.L. Alleyne J.E. Patterson Y.R. Burwell R.D. The Floor Projection Maze: A novel behavioral apparatus for presenting visual stimuli to rats.J. Neurosci. Methods. 2009; 181: 82-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The location of stimulus presentation alternated by trial between the east and west sides of the maze. We predicted that POR neurons would signal the presence of conjunctions of objects and places as well as particular locations. Consistent with our prediction, POR cells indeed signaled the conjunction of objects and locations. This finding argues against a strict functional segregation of spatial and nonspatial input to the hippocampus and provides evidence that context may be encoded upstream of the hippocampus. Animals were trained on two discrimination problems, each consisting of a pair of 2D visual stimuli (Figure 1D) back-projected onto the floor of the maze (Figure 1A). Object pairs were presented in two locations (east and west) to allow assessment of conjunctions of object-location selectivity. After a series of shaping steps (see Table S1 and Supplemental Text available online), rats were trained on the final task in which presentation of object pairs alternated from east to west by trial (Figures 1B and 1E). Each new trial was signaled by the onset of white noise when the rat was in the reward area on the side of the maze opposite the side on which stimuli would next be presented (Figure 1E). Stimuli were presented when the rat had remained still in the ready position for a variable time (500–700 ms). The rat made a choice by approaching one of the two stimuli. A correct choice was followed by chocolate milk reward delivered in the reward area at a location behind the correct stimulus. If the rat first approached the incorrect stimulus, the trial terminated and no reward was provided. Initially, the two problems were presented in blocks of 10 trials. Following surgery, implanted rats were retrained on the blocked-trial version of the task until performing at >70% accuracy. They were then placed on a random-trial version of the task. Single-unit and local field potential (LFP) recordings were obtained during daily sessions of 100 trials. All sessions in which the animal performed at or above 65% correct were analyzed. If performance dropped below 65%, rats were returned to blocked trials until accuracy improved. Preliminary analyses indicated no differences in selectivity between blocked and random sessions, so data from both session types were combined for all analyses. Stereotrodes were lowered at the end of daily recording sessions, and no attempt was made to hold single units across sessions. For recorded sessions, percent correct ranged from 65%–79% (69% ± 1%). Mean latencies to choice were 3.67 ± 0.10 s for correct trials and 2.95 ± 0.17 s for incorrect trials. Median latencies were 2.45 s for correct trials and 0.89 s for incorrect trials. Once well-trained, rats exhibited highly stereotyped pathways when approaching the chosen object, and nearly always checked the other food port before returning to the ready position (Figure 1C, right). We recorded 97 well-isolated cells from 31 stereotrodes implanted in the POR of five animals during 32 sessions (electrode tip locations; Figure 2A). The mean firing rate per session for all cells was 3.66 ± 0.29 Hz (range, 0.55–15.64 Hz). Firing rates were analyzed separately for three behaviorally relevant epochs of time (Figure 1E): the “stimulus” epoch, the 500 ms following stimulus presentation; the “selection” epoch, the 500 ms before stimulus choice; and the “reward” epoch, the 500 ms following stimulus choice during which reward was delivered. Behavioral correlates were determined by factorial analysis of variance (ANOVA) of correct trials (side × object × response). Analyses were restricted to correct trials because low numbers of incorrect trials resulted in low sampling of some trial types. Of the 97 cells isolated, 71 met an analysis criterion of at least three correct trials for each of the eight trial types and a minimum of 20 spikes in the epoch analyzed (stimulus, selection, or reward). Of those 71 cells, 14 cells were recorded on stereotrodes in which one wire was compromised. All cells including those 14 cells were determined by autocorrelation analysis and cluster separation to be well isolated (Figure 2C). Of the 71 criterion cells, 55 (77%) displayed selectivity as demonstrated by main effects or interactions of object, side, and response in at least one epoch. For example, some cells showed selectivity for a side of the maze (west, Figure 3A, left), a particular object (object 1, Figure 3B, left), a particular object in a particular location (object 2 in the southeast, Figure 3B, right), or an egocentric response (right response, Figure 3C, right). We predicted that POR cells would show patterns of activity consistent with representing conjunctions of 2D objects and places. As expected, a number of POR cells (25/71, 35%) showed selectivity for both object and location in at least one behavioral epoch. Numbers of such cells were roughly equal across epochs (Table 1). Object-location conjunction cells were of three types. The first type, cells with object × side interactions, fired more to an object depending on the side of the maze on which it was presented. For example, a cell might fire more to object 1 in the east and object 2 in the west. A second type of object-location conjunction cell, identified by an object × response interaction, was similar except that the location of firing for a particular pattern was located on the diagonal. For example, a cell would fire more to object 1 when it appeared on the right, regardless of the side of the maze (Figure 3B, center). We considered these cells to be object-location cells because they also fired more to one object than the other in specific locations (e.g., in the northwest and southeast). Finally, we observed cells that fired preferentially to a particular object only when it was in a single quadrant. These cells were identified by a significant object × side × response interaction. The example cell shown in Figure 3B (right) fired preferentially to object 2 only when it was located in one of the four quadrants.Table 1Response Patterns of POR Cells by Factorial ANOVASignificant Main Effects and InteractionsCells by Epoch (n = 71)StimulusSelectionRewardObject-Location Conjunctions7118 Object∗Side131 Object∗Response131 Object∗Side∗Response11 Multiple Object/Response13 Multiple Object/Side/Response433Object Correlates††2Location Correlates51316 Side246 Side∗Response165 Multiple Side/Response235Response Correlates31015Total Selective Cells (of 71)153441Numbers of cells that exhibited significant main effects or interactions during each of the three behavioral epochs (Stimulus, Selection, and Reward). The 71 cells were analyzed separately for each epoch.

For example, two cells in the Multiple Side/Response category showed a main effect of response and a response∗side interaction. † Under Object Correlates, one cell in the Stimulus and one in the Selection epochs showed a main effect of Object, but each of those cells had multiple main effects and/or interactions and are thus counted in one of the multiple categories.

The 71 cells were analyzed separately for each epoch.

For example, two cells in the Multiple Side/Response category showed a main effect of response and a response∗side interaction. † Under Object Correlates, one cell in the Stimulus and one in the Selection epochs showed a main effect of Object, but each of those cells had multiple main effects and/or interactions and are thus counted in one of the multiple categories. See Table S2 for laminar differences and Table S3 for stability across epochs. Because the POR is implicated in the processing of spatial and contextual information, we also predicted neural correlates of specific locations. There were two types of location correlates identified by factorial ANOVA. Selectivity for side was indicated by increased firing on the east or the west side of the maze (Figure 2B, middle panels; Figure 3A, left). A conjunction of side and response could indicate selectivity for the north or south of the maze (Figure 2B, lower; Figure 3A, center) or for a single quadrant (Figure 3A, right). Overall, 41% of cells meeting criterion (29/71) exhibited a main effect of side or a side × response interaction in at least one epoch. During the stimulus epoch, when the rat was positioned near the center of the maze, five cells demonstrated such location correlates (Table 1). This is interesting because, at stimulus onset, the animal was in the center of the maze viewing the location in which the object had appeared, but was not physically in the location. During the selection and reward epochs, when the animals were approaching or were in the location of a stimulus, more cells showed selectivity for location—13 and 16 during selection and reward, respectively (Table 1). These results suggest that attending to a particular location from a distance does control activity of POR cells, but not as robustly as the animal’s physical location, at least in this task. Four cells (6%) exhibited a main effect of object, in that firing rate was significantly higher to one of the two correct objects (Figure 3B, left). Two of those cells, however, also showed conjunctive selectivity in that they also exhibited a significant effect or interaction for some other aspect of the task (Table 1). Unexpectedly, a large proportion of POR cells showed selectivity for a left versus right motor response regardless of the identity of the correct object or the side of the maze on which it was presented (Figure 2B, upper; Figure 3C; Table 1). Of the 71 cells meeting criterion, 49% (35) exhibited a main effect of response in at least one epoch. The cell shown in Figure 3C fired more for right than left responses. The effect was marginally significant during the stimulus epoch and significant during the selection and reward epochs. It might be argued that the response cells were simply signaling two different spatial locations rather than the egocentric response. If that were the case, we would expect to see roughly equal numbers of cells that signal the two locations in the north (left east and right west) or the two locations in the south (east right and west left). We quantified the number of cells with a significant side × response interaction that fired more in the north or the south and observed 0, 4, and 2 such cells during stimulus, selection, and reward epochs, respectively. In contrast, we observed 3, 10, and 15 response cells during the same epochs (Table 1), suggesting that these cells encode something other than location, most likely egocentric responses. We were interested in whether differences in patterns of selectivity depended upon the laminar location of cells. Of our 71 criterion cells, 32 were in superficial layers, 18 were in deep layers and the layer of the remaining 21 cells could not be precisely determined. Whether or not a cell showed selectivity for egocentric responses, particular objects, or object-location conjunctions was not influenced by laminar location (Table S2). As might be predicted by connectivity, however, cells in deep layers were more likely to exhibit spatial selectivity (χ2(1) = 3.125, p < 0.039). Deep layers are targeted by subicular input (Kloosterman et al., 2003Kloosterman F. Witter M.P. Van Haeften T. Topographical and laminar organization of subicular projections to the parahippocampal region of the rat.J. Comp. Neurol. 2003; 455: 156-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). In addition, although the posterior parietal cortex projects to superficial and deep layers, the deep layers are preferentially targeted (Burwell and Amaral, 1998aBurwell R.D. Amaral D.G. Cortical afferents of the perirhinal, postrhinal, and entorhinal cortices of the rat.J. Comp. Neurol. 1998; 398: 179-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar). In general, the proportion of cells showing some type of selectivity differed significantly across epochs (χ2(2) = 12.07, p < 0.002), such that the numbers increased as the trial progressed, from 15 cells during presentation of the stimulus to 34 and 41 during selection and reward, respectively (Table 1). Numbers of cells exhibiting object and object-location conjunctions were not significantly different across epochs (p = 0.60). Cells showing egocentric response correlates, however, increased significantly across epochs (χ2(2) = 7.79, p < 0.02). Numbers of cells showing location correlates were marginally significantly different across epochs (χ2(2) = 5.71, p < 0.06). Thus, location and response correlates were more evident in the selection and reward epochs. To understand the stability of behavioral correlates, we examined patterns of selectivity across the three epochs. Of the 55 cells that were responsive in at least one epoch, 26 (47%) exhibited selectivity only in a single epoch and 29 (53%) exhibited selectivity in 2 or 3 epochs (Table S3). Of the 29 cells selective in more than one epoch, 11 exhibited similar patterns of selectivity across epochs. Of those, 6 were stable for location, 4 for response, and one for object-location selectivity. The remaining 18 of 29 cells changed patterns of selectivity across epochs. In all cases, the change was between stimulus/selection epochs and the reward epoch when the stimulus was no longer visible. One-third of these cells (6) changed from object-location to location selectivity and one third (6) changed from object-location to response selectivity. Three cells changed from some type of location selectivity to object-location selectivity in that the cell acquired selectivity for a particular object in the same location. Finally, three cells changed from selectivity for one location or response to selectivity for another location or response during the reward epoch. Thus, location and response cells tended to be stable across epochs, and cells that exhibited object location-selectivity changed between the stimulus/selection epochs and the reward epoch, when the stimulus was no longer visible. Because brain oscillations, particularly in the theta and gamma ranges, are thought to represent or encode various important aspects of memory and cognition, we conducted multitaper spectral analyses of the POR LFP signals, focusing on the theta and gamma bands. The power spectrum of 42 LFPs (21 sessions from five rats) was calculated over the entire session. Theta rhythms were defined as 6–12 Hz oscillations, low gamma as 30–50 Hz, and high gamma as 70–110 Hz. For POR LFPs, power in the theta range was higher than that expected from a 1/f power spectrum for 37 of 42 LFPs (88%; Figure 4A). To examine whether there were any task-dependent variations in the theta-band LFP signal, we calculated the power spectrum for each of the four task epochs, averaging across all trials of a session. Theta power differed across epochs in 90% of the LFPs (38/42). Specifically, theta power was greater for the task-related epochs (ready position, stimulus, and selection) when the animal was waiting for or processing the visual stimulus, as compared to the non-task-related reward epoch, when the stimulus was no longer relevant (Figure 4B). Theta oscillations in the hippocampus are strongly modulated by the speed at which an animal moves (reviewed in Buzsáki, 2005Buzsáki G. Theta rhythm of navigation: link between path integration and landmark navigation, episodic and semantic memory.Hippocampus. 2005; 15: 827-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar), so we next asked if there were systematic changes in running speed across epochs, and if POR theta oscillations were also modulated by speed. Figure 5A shows examples of event triggered average running speed for three representative animals. Rats were required to be in the ready location for 500–700 ms prior to stimulus onset, so speed was low during that time (Figure 5A, upper panels). Immediately after presentation of the stimulus, animals began to move toward the choice point. Speed tended to be highest during the selection epoch, prior to choice, and lowest during the reward epoch when animals were checking the reward port for food (Figure 5A, lower panels). We found a strong correlation between running speed and the amplitude of theta oscillations (Figures 5B and 5C). Running speed was an excellent predictor of theta power in the nontask phase (reward to ready position). as well as the ready and stimulus periods of the task. However, theta power during both the selection and reward epochs was significantly lower than expected based on running speed alone (Figure 5C). Thus, theta power was additionally modulated (in this case, decreased) by the selection and reward epochs of the task. An analysis of correct versus incorrect trials revealed that running speed was significantly slower for incorrect trials as compared to correct trials during the selection epoch (t = 17.40, n = 21 sessions, p < 0.0001), but not for any other epoch (Figure 6A). Interestingly, for the reward epoch, in which running speed was exactly the same for correct and incorrect trials (p = 0.58; Figure S1), theta power was significantly greater following incorrect choices (t = −3.88, n = 42 LFPs, p < 0.0004; Figure 6B). Finally, using circular statistics, we examined whether the activity of individual cells was modulated by POR theta. Of 69 cells recorded during LFP sessions, 26 (38%) showed significant phase-locking (Figure 7). This proportion was similar whether phase locking was determined using a local (same stereotrode) or nonlocal field potential (different stereotrode, but also in POR). Figure 7A shows three examples of cells phase locked to theta. Although some cells were phase locked to the peak of theta (5/26; 19%), most were phase locked to the trough (21/26; 81%). We examined the possibility that the cells phaselocked to the peak of theta are interneurons by assessing a spike width parameter, the duration from trough to peak. Four of the 26 phase locked cells (15%) exhibited narrow spike widths, with a mean trough to peak duration of 135.2 μs and were thus classified as putative fast-spiking inhibitory interneurons. The remaining phase locked cells (22 of 26) had broad spike widths, with a mean trough to peak duration of 425 μs and were classified as putative excitatory cells. Three of the four putative interneurons were phase locked to the peak of theta oscillations. Twenty of twenty-two excitatory cells were phase locked to the trough of theta. These results are similar to observations of the distinct theta phases of identified pyramidal cells and fast-spiking parvalbumin-positive basket cells in the hippocampus (Klausberger and Somogyi, 2008Klausberger T. Somogyi P. Neuronal diversity and temporal dynamics: the unity of hippocampal circuit operations.Science. 2008; 321: 53-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (1428) Google Scholar). The circular mean preferred phase of all cells was 197.05° ± 16.06° (17° or ∼5 ms after the trough; Figure 7D). Interestingly, in some cases, POR cells recorded on the same stereotrode sometimes exhibited very different phase-locking preferences (Figure 7E). For 7 of 11 LFPs (64%) with simultaneously recorded cells, the preferred phase of significantly phase locked cells differed by 40° or less. For the remaining 4 (36%) LFPs, phase preferences differed by greater than 100°. In three of those cases, preferred phases were split between the trough and peak of theta. The broad distribution of phase preferences suggests that POR cells comprise different cell types that may play different roles in theta-based information processing. Gamma power was not visually increased compared to the 1/f power log decay either for low gamma or high gamma. Because of a substantial level of 60 cycle noise, we were not able to conduct event related analyses of gamma power. We did, however, examine whether the activity of individual cells wa"

However, the connection between cochlear mechanics and the amplificatory function of hair cells remains unclear. Using an optical technique that permits the targeted inactivation of prestin, a protein of outer hair cells that generates forces on the basilar membrane, we demonstrate that these forces interact locally with cochlear traveling waves to achieve enormous mechanical amplification. By perturbing amplification in narrow segments of the basilar membrane, we further show that a cochlear traveling wave accumulates gain as it approaches its peak. Analysis of these results indicates that cochlear amplification produces negative damping that counters the viscous drag impeding traveling waves; targeted photoinactivation locally interrupts this compensation. These results reveal the locus of amplification in cochlear traveling waves and connect the characteristics of normal hearing to molecular forces."

The mutant uncovers a novel mechanism whereby “superactive” STIM1 DQ leads to altered oligomerization rate constants and to degradation of Orai1 with a change in stoichiometry of activator (STIM1) to effector (Orai1) ratio leading to altered Ca2+ homeostasis. Background: Calcium influx (ICRAC) is important for proper cell function. Results: A novel STIM1 mutant increases ICRAC, Ca2+-dependently destabilizes Orai1, and alters clustering. A new mathematical model explains the phenotype. Conclusion: The molecular kinetics of STIM1 and Orai1 are major determinants of ICRAC. Significance: The diffusion trap model and alteration of Orai1 stability provide a tool for understanding ICRAC regulation. Orai1 Ca2+ channels are important gateways for Ca2+ entry following receptor-mediated phospholipase C-dependent depletion of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3)-sensitive 4The abbreviations used are: IP3inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphateSTIMstromal interaction moleculeSOCEstore-operated calcium entryCRACcalcium release-activated calciumTgthapsigarginCDcurrent densityERendoplasmic reticulumPMplasma membraneTIRFTotal Internal Reflection FluorescentFRAPfluorescence recovery after photobleachingSAMsterile α motifNMDGN-methyl-d-glucamineDVFdivalent freeRFPred fluorescent proteinSAstreptavidin. Ca2+ stores. Activation of T cells through binding and dimerization of T cell receptors with antigen-loaded major histocompatibility complexes of antigen presenting cells is one example of such a signal that results in phospholipase Cγ-mediated production of IP3 and diacylglycerol. The resulting inward Ca2+ release-activated Ca2+ current (ICRAC) controls not only ubiquitous cellular functions, e.g. proliferation and apoptosis, but also cell specific functions such as cytokine production or target cell killing (1Hogan P.G.

To initiate SOCE, the luminal domain of endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-localized STIM1 proteins dissociate their EF-hand-bound Ca2+ ions in response to ER Ca2+ release, thereby initiating a conformational change, oligomerization, and subsequent movement to ER-PM junctions. The new conformation unfolds C-terminally localized coiled-coil regions of STIM1 and enables interaction of the C-terminal lysine-rich repeat with plasma membrane (PM) lipids. The thereby exposed interaction domain (named either CRAC activation domain (CAD), STIM1 Orai1-activating region (SOAR) or ORAI1-activating small fragment (OASF)) directly interact with and trap Orai1 channels (8Muik M.

The minimal requirement for activation are two STIM1 molecules bound per Orai1 tetramer; however, this stoichiometry results in channels with very low open probability (Po), whereas maximal Po is achieved with eight bound STIM1 proteins per Orai1 tetramer (15Li Z.

Failure to activate this Ca2+ entry pathway either by defective STIM1 molecules or by mutations in Orai1 proteins results in severe defects in immune cell function but also in defective skin, platelet, and neuronal functions, among others (5Gwack Y.

More moderate physiological and pathophysiological changes in immune cell function occur during aging, but also in autoimmunity and cancer. One mechanism to alter immune cell function arises from the degree and pattern of glycosylation in immune cells (19Marth J.D. Grewal P.K. Mammalian glycosylation in immunity.Nat. Rev.

Rev. 2009; 230: 97-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Although many immune cell surface receptors show complex glycosylation patterns, one alternative target to affect immune cell function by changes in glycosylation may involve altering proteins that regulate SOCE. In this study, we investigate the individual contributions of altered glycosylation status of ICRAC-mediating proteins and of possibly glycosylation-independent functional changes of mutations within the sterile α motif (SAM) domain of STIM1. inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate stromal interaction molecule store-operated calcium entry calcium release-activated calcium thapsigargin current density endoplasmic reticulum plasma membrane Total Internal Reflection Fluorescent fluorescence recovery after photobleaching sterile α motif N-methyl-d-glucamine divalent free red fluorescent protein streptavidin. An Orai1 stable cell line was generated by transfecting HEK293 or Jurkat E6.1 T cells with N-terminally HA-tagged Orai1. The expression vector pGK-Puro-MO70 (21Gwack Y. Srikanth S. Feske S.

Orai1 coding sequence was amplified with the forward primer 3′-gggctcgaggccGCCACCATGCATCCGGAGCCCGC-5′ and the reverse primer 3′-gggctcgagTCAGGCATAGTGGCTGCCGG-5′, adding the HA tag and XhoI recognition site that has been used for cloning into the vector. Stable cells were selected using either 1 μg/ml puromycin (HEK) or 2 μg/ml (Jurkat). HEK293 cells were maintained in a 37 °C, 5% CO2 humidified incubator in minimum essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and penicillin-streptomycin. HEK293 cells were passaged by treatment with trypsin/EDTA. All hOrai and hStim constructs were subcloned into pCAGGS-IRES-GFP or pCAGGS-IRES-RFP. Tagged constructs were subcloned in pMAX (C) RFP, pMAX (C) GFP, or YFP (N) pEX vectors. Mutagenesis was performed by QuikChange PCR (Stratagene). Mutations in hOrai1 were conducted in the hOrai1-SmaI fragment subcloned in pBlue script. All constructs were confirmed by sequencing. For transfection, the indicated amount of DNA (0.5 μg of Orai1 and 1.5 μg of STIM1 unless otherwise indicated) was electroporated into HEK293 cells with Nucleofactor II electroporator and kit V (Lonza). The cells were transfected according to the manufacturer's instructions and seeded 24 h before measurements. For biochemical methods, HEK293 cells were transfected at 70–80% confluency with corresponding plasmids using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science). The total sizes of Orai1 and Stim1 plasmids were 7070 and 8212 bp, respectively and the amounts of transfected DNA were converted into moles using an online conversion application. For detection of surface proteins, transfected cells were harvested after 48 h, washed twice with 10 ml of PBS phosphate buffered saline containing 1 mm MgCl2 and 0.5 mm CaCl2, pH 8) and incubated with NHS-Biotin (0.5 mg/ml) for 30 min at 4 °C. Unbound biotin was quenched with PBSB (PBS with 0.1% BSA, pH 8). Cells were harvested with 2 mm EDTA in PBS, pH 7.4, washed with PBS, and lysed in PBS containing 1% Triton, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.4, with freshly added protease inhibitors. Protein content of cell lysate was determined by the BCA method (Pierce). Cell lysates containing 1 mg of total protein were incubated with avidin beads (Pierce) on a rotating wheel at 4 °C for 3 h and then washed with lysis buffer containing 0.25 m NaCl to remove unbound protein. Alternatively, for more stringent conditions, avidin beads were washed with 1 mm urea and 7 m thiourea followed by a final 0.75 m NaCl wash. Biotinylated fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by Western blot. For analysis of expression levels paralleling patch clamp analyses, transfected HEK293 cells were lysed after 24 h. Lysis buffer contained 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% sodium deoxcholate, 1% Nonidet P-40, 5 mm Tris, pH 8, supplemented with protease inhibitors. 50–75 μg of the total proteins were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE, and proteins were electrotransferred on nitrocellulose or PVDF membranes. Immunoblots were probed with anti-Orai1 (Sigma; 1:2000), anti-STIM1 (BD Biosciences; 1:250 or 1:500), anti-HA (Roche Applied Science; 1:1000), anti-GAPDH (Cell Signaling; 1:2000), or anti-γ-tubulin (Sigma; 1:1000) antibodies. Specificity of the anti-Orai1 antibody was also confirmed in native tissue using siRNA against Orai1 (22Stanisz H. Stark A. Kilch T. Schwarz E.C. Müller C.S. Peinelt C. Hoth M. Niemeyer B.A. Vogt T.

Recording electrodes with a resistance of 2–3 MΩ were used and coated with Sigmacote. Pipette and cell capacitance were electronically compensated before each voltage ramp with an EPC-10 patch clamp amplifier controlled by Patchmaster software (HEKA). Series resistance was compensated to 85% for the transfected HEK293 cells. Immediately after establishing whole cell configuration, linear voltage ramps from −150 to +150 mV (50-ms duration) were applied every 2 s from a holding potential of 0 mV for the indicated time period. Membrane currents were sampled at 10 kHz and filtered at 2.9 kHz. For leak current correction, the ramp current before CRAC activation was subtracted. Voltages were corrected for a liquid junction potential of 10 mV in standard bath solution and of 17 mV for NMDG-containing solution. Currents were analyzed at −140 mV and 110 s after break-in, unless otherwise indicated. The currents were normalized to whole cell capacitance, and significant outliers (p < 0.05; Grubb's test) were excluded. The pipette solution for fast activation contained the following: 120 mm cesium glutamate, 3 mm MgCl2, 20 mm cesium BAPTA, 10 mm Hepes, and 0.05 mm IP3 (pH 7.2 with CsOH). The pipette solution for the passive depletion contained the following: 120 mm cesium aspartate, 8 mm NaCl, 10 mm EGTA, 3 mm MgCl2, and 10 Hepes (pH 7.2 with CsOH). Bath solution contained 120 mm NaCl, 10 mm tetraethylammonium chloride (TEA-Cl), 2 mm CaCl2 or 20 mm CaCl2, 2 mm MgCl2, 10 mm Hepes, and glucose (pH 7.2 with NaOH). Divalent free (DVF) bath solution contained the following: 120 mm NaCl, 10 mm TEA-Cl, 10 mm Hepes, 10 mm EDTA, and glucose (pH 7.2). Nominal Ca2+-free solution did not contain added CaCl2. Normalized instantaneous tail currents for voltage steps to −100 mV after test pulses in the range of −160 to 80 mV were used to produce the apparent open probabilities (Po). To determine the amplitude of the instantaneous tail currents and to minimize the error caused by cell capacitance, tail currents were fitted with a single exponential function to the beginning of the −100 mV pulse. For noise analysis, DVF contained 155 mm NaCl, 10 mm HEDTA, 1 mm EDTA, and 10 mm Hepes (pH 7.2 with NMDG). For experiments examining the block of Na+ conducted ICRAC by Ca2+, CaCl2 was added to the divalent free solution at the appropriate amount calculated from MaxChelator software program. Protocol and analysis was used as described by Prakriya and Lewis (23Prakriya M. Lewis R.S. Regulation of CRAC channel activity by recruitment of silent channels to a high open-probability gating mode.J. Gen. Physiol. 2006; 128: 373-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). External solution contained 155 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm CaCl2 (unless otherwise indicated), 2 mm MgCl2, 10 mm glucose, and 5 mm Hepes (pH 7.4 with NaOH). Stock solutions of thapsigargin (Tg) were prepared in Me2SO at a concentration of 1 mm. HEK293 cells grown in low density on 25-mm glass coverslips were loaded with 1 μm Fura 2-AM in minimum essential growth medium in a 37 °C, 5% CO2 humidified incubator for 20 min. All of the experiments were performed in a perfusion chamber with low volume and high solution exchange rate at room temperature. Images were analyzed with TILLVision software. The absolute intracellular Ca2+ concentration was estimated from the relation [Ca2+]i = K*(R − Rmin)/(Rmax − R) where the values of K, Rmin, and Rmax were determined from an in situ calibration of Fura 2-AM in HEK293 cells as described by Grynkiewicz et al. (24Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. A new generation of Ca2+ indicators with greatly improved fluorescence properties.J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). HEK293 cells were split 24 h after transfection of 3 μg of YFP (N) STIM1 WT/DQ and 1 μg of Orai1 (C) RFP and seeded on 25-mm glass coverslips for 24 h before measurements. The external solution contained 155 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm CaCl2, 2 mm MgCl2, 10 mm glucose, and 5 mm Hepes (pH 7,4 with NaOH). A Leica AM TIRF MC system with a 100× 1.47 NA oil HCX PlanApo objective was used for recording fluorescence images. Excitation and analyses of YFP fluorescent proteins was achieved with a 488-nm laser and a GFP emission filter. Reflected light was collected with cooled electron multiplier charge coupled device camera (Andor iXon 885). Exposure time for YFP was 100 ms at 15% laser intensity. The penetration depth of the evanescent wave was set at 110 nm. To detect RFP, a 561-nm laser at 50% intensity and a RFP emission filter were used. Exposure time was set to 200 ms. FRET measurements were performed in the TIRF plane with an exposure time of 200 ms and a penetration depth of 150 nm. Laser intensities between 25 and 35% were typically used. To detect the STIM1-Orai1 interaction, HEK293 cells were transfected with 3 μg of STIM1 WT/DQ (C) RFP and 1 μg of Orai1 (C) GFP; for the STIM1-STIM1 interaction, the cells were transfected with 1.5 μg of STIM1 WT/DQ (C) RFP, 1.5 μg of STIM1 WT/DQ (C) GFP, and 0.5 μg of Orai1. Stores were depleted incubating the cells for 10 min with 1 μm Tg. FRET was evaluated using the normalized FRET method of Van Rheenen et al. (38van Rheenen J. Langeslag M. Jalink K. Biophys. J. 2004; 86: 2517-2529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). FRET images were corrected for cross-talk, direct excitation, and background. Calibration values were obtained every day of measurements from cells expressing only the GFP- or RFP-labeled constructs. All of the experiments were performed at room temperature. Confocal imaging was performed on multibeam confocal scanner systems (VTinfinity-3; VisiTech Int., Sunderland, UK) using a 60× oil immersion objective. Images were acquired at room temperature in the 2 mm Ca2+ solution used for Ca2+ imaging. For monitoring recovery after stimulation, the cells were treated with 1 μm Tg in a Ca2+-free solution for 10 min before imaging in the same solution. To induce bleaching, the intensity of a 491-nm laser was set to 100% and directed to a predefined region within the cell for 7 s. Initial fluorescence and recovery after photobleach were measured by scanning across the bleached region at a laser intensity of 40% for 100 ms and a frequency of 1 Hz. Recovery was monitored over 5 min. After acquisition, the data were transferred into ImageJ software (National Institutes of Health) for further processing. To correct for autobleaching effects, fluorescence intensity was integrated over a region overlaying the photobleached profile and a nonbleached control region. The changes in ratio between the two regions were plotted over time. The relative intensity before and immediately after photobleaching were set to 1 and 0, respectively. Time constants (τ) were calculated for each cell by fitting the resulting curve with an exponential function using Igor software (Wavemetrics). We describe STIM1-Orai1 interaction/oligomerization mathematically by the reaction scheme depicted in Fig. 6B and assume that all monomers/oligomers can diffuse within a two-dimensional area (Fig. 6A). The resulting reaction-diffusion system is studied by computer simulations based upon a two-dimensional Gillespie Monte Carlo Algorithm (25Gillespie D.T. A general method for numerically simulating the stochastic time evolution of coupled chemical reactions.J. Comput. Phys. 1976; 22: 403-434Crossref Scopus (4240) Google Scholar, 26Gibson M.A. Bruck J. Efficient exact stochastic simulation of chemical systems with many species and many channels.J. Phys. Chem. A. 2000; 104: 1876-1889Crossref Scopus (1189) Google Scholar). Because CRAC channel activation is a local process (11Liou J. Fivaz M. Inoue T. Meyer T. Live-cell imaging reveals sequential oligomerization and local plasma membrane targeting of stromal interaction molecule 1 after Ca2+ store depletion.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 9301-9306Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar), we model a geometry of 15 × 15 grid cells, each describing an area of (0.2 μm)2, which represents the cell plasma membrane and the ER membrane at the same time. For the diffusion of STIM1 monomers, STIM1 dimers, and Orai1, we assume periodic boundary conditions and only at the grid cell right in the middle of our geometry (Plasma Membrane Junction; see Fig. 6A), STIM1 dimers can trap Orai1 and build up the four different CRAC channel states OS1, OS2, OS3, and OS4, consisting of one Orai1 tetramer and one to four STIM1 dimers. The STIM1 to Orai1 binding process is less probable the more STIM1 dimers are already bound to an Orai1 tetramer, which is controlled by the negative cooperativity factor α. The CRAC channel states defined in this way become more stable the more STIM1 dimers participate in forming the channel, which is quantified by the cooperativity factor β (16Hoover P.J. Lewis R.S. Stoichiometric requirements for trapping and gating of Ca2+ release-activated Ca2+ (CRAC) channels by stromal interaction molecule 1 (STIM1).Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2011; 108: 13299-13304Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Each of these four states contributes in a specific, predefined way to the total CRAC channel current, ICRAC = 0.001·OS1 + 0.025·OS2 + 0.275·OS3 + 1.0·OS4, modeling the experimentally observed graded channel currents (15Li Z. Liu L. Deng Y. Ji W. Du W. Xu P. Chen L. Xu T.

In addition to the wild type, we model four different mutants, which differ by diffusion constants or reaction rates, to test which one fits best to the experimental results for STIM1 DQ mutants. Mutant A represents a stronger oligomerization of STIM1 monomers (10·k1(WT) = k1(A)), Mutant B represents a stronger STIM1 to Orai1 binding (10·ki(WT) = ki(B),i ∈ {3, 5, 7, 9}), Mutant C represents a decreased negative cooperativity of STIM1 to Orai1 binding (α(C) = 1.5 ≠ α(WT) = 5), and Mutant D represents faster STIM1 dimer diffusion (10·D2STIM1(WT) = D2STIM1(D)).TABLE 1Model parametersTABLE 1Model parameters The data were analyzed using TILL Vision (TILL Photonics), Igor Pro (Wavemetrics), LAS (Leica Application suite) Software 2.4.1, Leica FRET SE Wizard Software, Patchmaster and Fitmaster (HEKA) and Microsoft Excel (Microsoft). All of the values are given as the means ± S.E. The numbers of cells are given within bar graphs. In case data points were normally distributed, an unpaired two-sided Student's t test was applied. Significance was as follows: p < 0.05 (*), p < 0.01 (**), or p < 0.001 (***). To control whether and how alterations of STIM1 and/or Orai1 N-glycosylation alter SOCE, we mutated the N-glycosylation site of Orai1 (Asn-223) and the potential luminal consensus sites for N-glycosylation in STIM1 (Asn-131 and Asn-171; Fig. 1A), which have been reported to be glycosylated in vivo (27Williams R.T. Senior P.V. Van Stekelenburg L. Layton J.E. Smith P.J. Dziadek M.A. Stromal interaction molecule 1 (STIM1), a transmembrane protein with growth suppressor activity, contains an extracellular SAM domain modified by N-linked glycosylation.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1596: 131-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Mutation of the N-glycosylation site of Orai1 N223A did not lead to a significant change in current density (CD) when co-expressed with STIM1 in HEK293 cells (supplemental Fig. S1, A and B). On the other hand, both Ca2+ influx and CD of the double mutant N131Q/N171Q (STIM1 QQ) were significantly smaller than wild type (STIM WT) (Fig. 1, B and C), consistent with work by Csutora et al. (28Csutora P. Peter K. Kilic H. Park K.M. Zarayskiy V. Gwozdz T. Bolotina V.M. Novel role for STIM1 as a trigger for calcium influx factor production.J. Biol.

Because substitution of an asparagine to a glutamine within the NX(S/T) consensus glycosylation motif does not support the secondary structure of an Asx turn, which is necessary for recognition by oligosaccharyltransferases, we mutated Asn-131 to Asp, which, while not being a substrate for oligosaccharyltransferases, still supports the secondary structure of the Asx turn (29Imperiali B.

https://openalex.org/W2139563546,"Heat shock protein (Hsp) 70 expression can be stimulated by febrile range temperature (FRT). Hsp70 has been shown to be elevated in serum of patients with sepsis, and when released from cells, extracellular Hsp70 exerts endotoxin-like effects through Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) receptors. Circulating TLR agonists and fever both persist for the first several days of sepsis, and each can activate Hsp70 expression; however, the effect of combined exposure to FRT and TLR agonists on Hsp70 expression is unknown. We found that concurrent exposure to FRT (39.5 °C) and agonists for TLR4 (LPS), TLR2 (Pam3Cys), or TLR3 (poly(IC)) synergized to increase Hsp70 expression and extracellular release in RAW264.7 macrophages. The increase in Hsp70 expression was associated with activation of p38 and ERK MAP kinases, phosphorylation of histone H3, and increased recruitment of HSF1 to the Hsp70 promoter. Pretreatment with the p38 MAPK inhibitor SB283580 but not the ERK pathway inhibitor UO126 significantly reduced Hsp70 gene modification and Hsp70 expression in RAW cells co-exposed to LPS and FRT. In mice challenged with intratracheal LPS and then exposed to febrile range hyperthermia (core temperature, ∼39.5 °C), Hsp70 levels in lung tissue and in cell-free lung lavage were increased compared with mice exposed to either hyperthermia or LPS alone. We propose a model of how enhanced Hsp70 expression and extracellular release in patients concurrently exposed to fever and TLR agonists may contribute to the pathogenesis of sepsis."

Vascular endothelial cadherin from contiguous endothelial cells forms AJs, which are stabilized intracellularly by binding of p120-catenin and cortical actin. Mechanisms inducing cortical actin formation and enabling its linkage with p120-catenin remain enigmatic. We altered the function of neural Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (N-WASP), which induces actin polymerization through actin-related protein 2/3 complex (Arp2/3), to address the role of N-WASP in regulating AJ stability and thereby endothelial permeability. We show that depletion of N-WASP in endothelial cells impaired AJ adhesion and favored the organization of actin from cortical actin to stress fibers, resulting thereby in formation of leaky endothelial barrier. Exposure of the N-WASP-depleted endothelial cell monolayer to the permeability-increasing mediator, thrombin, exaggerated AJ disruption and stress fiber formation, leading to an irreversible increase in endothelial permeability. We show that N-WASP binds p120-catenin through its verprolin cofilin acid (VCA) domain, induces cortical actin formation through Arp2, and links p120-catenin with cortical actin.

https://openalex.org/W2053535517,"Background Recent studies have revealed that body mass index (BMI) inversely influenced serum glycated albumin (GA), which may cause an underestimation of GA-monitored short-term hyperglycemic control. Objective This study was to investigate the association between anthropometric variables (BMI and waist circumference (W)) and accurate adiposity variables (percentage of body fat (%fat), fat mass, free fat mass (FFM), subcutaneous fat area (SFA), and visceral fat area (VFA)) with serum GA. Design A total of 2563 subjects (1037 men, 593 premenopausal women, and 933 postmenopausal women) with normal glucose tolerance underwent bioelectrical impedance body fat content measurement and magnetic resonance imaging. Serum GA and absolute value of GA (aGA) were measured by enzymatic assay. Results Compared to the BMI <25.0 kg/m2 group, the BMI ≥25.0 kg/m2 group had significantly higher fasting plasma glucose, glycated hemoglobin A1c, and body fat parameters including W, %fat, fat mass, FFM, SFA, and VFA, but significantly lower aGA, and GA in all the three sex- and menopause-stratified groups (all P<0.05). GA decreased with the increment of fat mass for all three groups (all P for trend <0.001). In the same BMI category, men and postmenopausal women with elevated %fat (men, ≥25%; women, ≥35%) still had significantly lower GA than those with normal %fat (men, <25%; women, <35%) (all P<0.05). Multiple stepwise regression showed that %fat, fat mass, and VFA were independently associated with GA. Conclusions Serum GA was inversely influenced by fat mass and visceral adipose tissue in Chinese with normal glucose tolerance."

The acquisition of stem-like traits might contribute to glioma initiation, growth, and recurrence. Here we investigated the role of the transcription factor myeloid Elf-1 like factor (MEF, also known as ELF4) in gliomas. We found that MEF is highly expressed in both human and mouse glioblastomas and its absence impairs gliomagenesis in a PDGF-driven glioma mouse model. We show that modulation of MEF levels in both mouse neural stem cells and human glioblastoma cells has a significant impact on neurosphere formation. Moreover, we identify Sox2 as a direct downstream target of MEF. Taken together, our studies implicate MEF as a previously unrecognized gatekeeper gene in gliomagenesis that promotes stem cell characteristics through Sox2 activation."

https://openalex.org/W2144469023,"Mechanistic insights into the reprogramming of fibroblasts to induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) are limited, particularly for early acting molecular regulators. Here we use an acute loss of function approach to demonstrate that activation-induced deaminase (AID) activity is necessary for the initiation of reprogramming to iPSCs. While AID is well known for antibody diversification, it has also recently been shown to have a role in active DNA demethylation in reprogramming toward pluripotency and development. These findings suggested a potential role for AID in iPSC generation, yet, iPSC yield from AID-knockout mouse fibroblasts was similar to that of wild-type (WT) fibroblasts. We reasoned that an acute loss of AID function might reveal effects masked by compensatory mechanisms during development, as reported for other proteins. Accordingly, we induced an acute reduction (>50%) in AID levels using 4 different shRNAs and determined that reprogramming to iPSCs was significantly impaired by 79 ± 7%. The deaminase activity of AID was critical, as coexpression of WT but not a catalytic mutant AID rescued reprogramming. Notably, AID was required only during a 72-h time window at the onset of iPSC reprogramming. Our findings show a critical role for AID activity in the initiation of reprogramming to iPSCs."
https://openalex.org/W2156245197,"We examined the role of ATP binding by six different ATPase subunits (Rpt1–6) in the cellular assembly and molecular functions of mammalian 26 S proteasome. Four Rpt subunits (Rpt1–4) with ATP binding mutations were incompetent for cellular assembly into 26 S proteasome. In contrast, analogous mutants of Rpt5 and Rpt6 were incorporated normally into 26 S proteasomes in both intact cells and an in vitro assembly assay. Surprisingly, purified 26 S proteasomes containing either mutant Rpt5 or Rpt6 had normal basal ATPase activity and substrate gate opening for hydrolysis of short peptides. However, these mutant 26 S proteasomes were severely defective for ATP-dependent in vitro degradation of ubiquitylated and non-ubiquitylated proteins and did not display substrate-stimulated ATPase and peptidase activities characteristic of normal proteasomes.

Intracellular protein degradation requires metabolic energy.

However, a comprehensive understanding of how ATP fuels the 26 S proteasome for proteolysis is lacking.

Proteasome subunit Rpn1 binds ubiquitin-like protein domains.Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 725-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). Thus, the Rpt subunit ring physically bridges the 20 S proteasome and elements of PA700 that prepare substrates for degradation. This topological feature enables the Rpt ring to use its ATP binding and hydrolyzing functions to coordinate and integrate multiple and diverse processes required for proteasomal proteolysis. For example, ATP binding and hydrolysis regulate polyubiquitin chain binding and subsequent substrate engagement (35Peth A. Uchiki T. Goldberg A.L. ATP-dependent steps in the binding of ubiquitin conjugates to the 26S proteasome that commit to degradation.Mol. Cell. 2010; 40: 671-681Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Subsequent rounds of ATP binding and hydrolysis probably promote alternating conformations of the Rpt ring that transmit mechanical force to substrates for substrate unfolding and translocation to the 20 S proteasome (36Henderson A.

ATP-dependent proteases degrade their substrates by processively unraveling them from the degradation signal.Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 627-737Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). Substrate processing also requires disassembly of the polyubiquitin chain, which cannot traverse the narrow 20 S substrate entry pore. As with peptide bond hydrolysis, deubiquitylation per se is not ATP-dependent but becomes ATP-dependent when integrated with overall substrate degradation (30Yao T. Cohen R.E. A cryptic protease couples deubiquitination and degradation by the proteasome.Nature. 2002; 419: 403-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar, 32Verma R. Aravind L. Oania R. McDonald W.H.

Role of Rpn11 metalloprotease in deubiquitination and degradation by the 26S proteasome.Science. 2002; 298: 611-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (832) Google Scholar). This feature may reflect an enforced mechanistic linkage of deubiquitylation to other steps in substrate processing to prevent loss of binding affinity prior to committed degradation (35Peth A. Uchiki T. Goldberg A.L. ATP-dependent steps in the binding of ubiquitin conjugates to the 26S proteasome that commit to degradation.Mol. Cell. 2010; 40: 671-681Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). In addition to regulating the function of intact 26 S proteasome, Rpt subunits play important roles in 26 S proteasome assembly. Interactions between C-terminal residues of Rpt subunits and 20 S proteasome are critical determinants of 26 S proteasome formation (38Kumar B. Kim Y.C. DeMartino G.N. The C terminus of Rpt3, an ATPase subunit of PA700 (19 S) regulatory complex, is essential for 26 S proteasome assembly but not for activation.J. Biol.

Chaperone-mediated pathway of proteasome regulatory particle assembly.Nature. 2009; 459: 861-865Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Certain Rpt subunits lacking C-terminal residues cannot assemble into 26 S proteasome in intact cells. Moreover, removal of C-terminal residues from any of several Rpt subunits in purified PA700 prevents its assembly into 26 S proteasome in an in vitro assembly reaction with 20 S proteasome (5Gillette T.G. Kumar B. Thompson D. Slaughter C.A. DeMartino G.N. Differential roles of the COOH termini of AAA subunits of PA700 (19 S regulator) in asymmetric assembly and activation of the 26 S proteasome.J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 31813-31822Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). 26 S proteasome assembly in this reaction depends on ATP binding but not hydrolysis (5Gillette T.G. Kumar B. Thompson D. Slaughter C.A. DeMartino G.N. Differential roles of the COOH termini of AAA subunits of PA700 (19 S regulator) in asymmetric assembly and activation of the 26 S proteasome.J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 31813-31822Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). This effect may reflect ATP-induced conformational changes in Rpt subunits that optimize the availability of C-terminal residues for 20 S proteasome binding. Such a mechanism appears to be conserved among other Rpt-like ATPases and their interactions with proteasomes. For example, PAN, an archaebacterial AAA protein ortholog of eukaryotic Rpt subunits, also requires ATP binding to associate with and promote gating of 20 S proteasome in vitro (18Smith D.M. Kafri G. Cheng Y. Ng D. Walz T. Goldberg A.L. ATP binding to PAN or the 26S ATPases causes association with the 20S proteasome, gate opening, and translocation of unfolded proteins.Mol. Cell. 2005; 20: 687-698Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, several aspects of the physiologic significance of ATP-dependent proteasome assembly remain unclear. First, the exact cellular pathway of 26 S proteasome assembly remains undefined (42Park S. Tian G. Roelofs J. Finley D. Assembly manual for the proteasome regulatory particle: the first draft.Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2010; 38: 6-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Despite some supporting evidence, it is not unambiguously established that 26 S proteasome is assembled in cells by binding of intact PA700 to 20 S proteasome. Second, conflicting results regarding the role of ATP binding by Rpt subunits in the cellular assembly of 26 S proteasome have been reported. For example, ATP binding mutations in individual yeast Rpt subunits produced a range of effects that vary according to the subunit (22Rubin D.M. Glickman M.H. Larsen C.N. Dhruvakumar S. Finley D. Active site mutants in the six regulatory particle ATPases reveal multiple roles for ATP in the proteasome.EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4909-4919Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). As with other features of proteasome function (43Erales J. Hoyt M.A. Troll F. Coffino P. Functional asymmetries of proteasome translocase pore.J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287: 18535-18543Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), these findings suggest non-redundant roles for Rpt subunits in ATP-dependent proteasome assembly. In contrast, a recent report indicated that ATP binding mutations of any Rpt subunit blocked 26 S proteasome assembly in mammalian cells (44Lee S.H. Moon J.H. Yoon S.K. Yoon J.B. Stable incorporation of ATPase subunits into 19 S regulatory particle of human proteasome requires nucleotide binding and C-terminal tails.J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287: 9269-9279Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). This work had two related initial goals: first, to determine the general and individual roles of ATP binding by Rpt subunits in 26 S proteasome assembly in intact mammalian cells and second, to evaluate the physiologic significance of ATP-dependent in vitro assembly of 26 S proteasome from purified 20 S proteasome and PA700. Our results show that defective ATP binding differentially affected cellular proteasomal assembly of Rpt subunits and unexpectedly allowed us to study the role of ATP binding in functions of purified 26 S proteasomes harboring either of two different single ATP binding-defective Rpt subunits. Results of these studies reveal critical roles of ATP binding in multiple aspects of proteasome function and provide insights to molecular mechanisms of ATP-regulated proteasome activity. cDNAs encoding each full-length wild-type human Rpt subunit (Rpt1–6; PSMC2, PSMC1, PSMC4, PSMC6, PSMC3, and PSMC5, respectively) were prepared as described previously (39Kim Y.C. DeMartino G.N. C termini of proteasomal ATPases play nonequivalent roles in cellular assembly of mammalian 26 S proteasome.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 26652-26666Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). For each cDNA, a conserved lysine residue in the Walker A motif (GPPGTGKT) known to be essential for ATP binding was mutated to alanine (45Matveeva E.A. He P. Whiteheart S.W.

Chem. 2010; 285: 24347-24359Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The mutant cDNA was subcloned into pIRESpuro3 expression vector (Clontech) featuring an N-terminal FLAG epitope (supplemental Fig. 1). Each construct was confirmed by DNA sequencing. As reported previously, wild-type Rpt2 was modified, apparently by proteolysis, upon stable expression in HEK293 cells (39Kim Y.C. DeMartino G.N. C termini of proteasomal ATPases play nonequivalent roles in cellular assembly of mammalian 26 S proteasome.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 26652-26666Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In contrast, Rpt2 lacking the last three (C-terminal) residues was expressed without modification and was assembled normally into 26 S proteasome. Therefore, the C-terminally truncated construct was used as the “wild-type” control for Rpt2 bearing an ATP binding mutation. HEK293 cells stably expressing wild-type or ATP binding mutant FLAG-Rpt subunits were established and cultured as described previously (39Kim Y.C. DeMartino G.N.

HEK293 cell lines were grown to ∼90% confluence, harvested, and washed with phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were disrupted in ice-cold buffer consisting of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5 at 4 °C, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm ATP, 5 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol by 15 passages through a 27-gauge needle. The lysates were centrifuged to remove debris to obtain a crude soluble fraction. Expression of Rpt proteins was determined by Western blot analysis using anti-FLAG M2 antibody (Sigma) and corresponding anti-Rpt antibodies.

https://openalex.org/W2018546846,"Outer hair cells (OHCs) are a mammalian innovation for mechanically amplifying sound energy to overcome the viscous damping of the cochlear partition. Although the voltage-dependent OHC membrane motor, prestin, has been demonstrated to be essential for mammalian cochlear amplification, the molecular mechanism by which prestin converts electrical energy into mechanical displacement/force remains elusive. Identifying mutations that alter the motor function of prestin provides vital information for unraveling the energy transduction mechanism of prestin. We show that the V499G/Y501H mutation does not deprive prestin of its voltage-induced motor activity, but it does significantly impair the fast motor kinetics and voltage operating range. Furthermore, mutagenesis studies suggest that Val-499 is the primary site responsible for these changes. We also show that V499G/Y501H prestin forms heteromers with wild-type prestin and that the fast motor kinetics of wild-type prestin is not affected by heteromer formation with V499G/Y501H prestin. These results suggest that prestin subunits are individually functional within a given multimer."
https://openalex.org/W2027909764,"Ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T) is a cerebellar neurodegenerative disorder; however, the basis for the neurodegeneration in A-T is not well established. Lesions in the ubiquitin and autophagy pathways are speculated to contribute to the neurodegeneration in other neurological diseases and may have a role in A-T neurodegeneration. Our recent studies revealed that the constitutively elevated ISG15 pathway impairs targeted proteasome-mediated protein degradation in A-T cells. Here, we demonstrate that the basal autophagy pathway is activated in the ubiquitin pathway-compromised A-T cells. We also show that genotoxic stress triggers aberrant degradation of the proteasome and autophagy substrates (autophagic flux) in A-T cells. Inhibition of autophagy at an early stage using 3-methyladenine blocked UV-induced autophagic flux in A-T cells. On the other hand, bafilomycin A1, which inhibits autophagy at a late stage, failed to block UV-induced autophagic flux, suggesting that overinduction of autophagy may underlie aberrant autophagic flux in A-T cells. The ISG15-specific shRNA that restored proteasome function restores autophagic function in A-T cells. These findings suggest that autophagy compensates for the ISG15-dependent ablation of proteasome-mediated protein degradation in A-T cells. Genotoxic stress overactivates this compensatory mechanism, triggering aberrant autophagic flux in A-T cells. Supporting the model, we show that autophagy is activated in the brain tissues of human A-T patients. This highlights a plausible causal contribution of a novel ""ISG15 proteinopathy"" in A-T neuronal cell death."
https://openalex.org/W2121600076,"Prolidase, also known as Xaa-Pro dipeptidase or peptidase D (PEPD), is a ubiquitously expressed cytosolic enzyme that hydrolyzes dipeptides with proline or hydroxyproline at the carboxyl terminus. In this article, however, we demonstrate that PEPD directly binds to and activates epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), leading to stimulation of signaling proteins downstream of EGFR, and that such activity is neither cell-specific nor dependent on the enzymatic activity of PEPD. In line with the pro-survival and pro-proliferation activities of EGFR, PEPD stimulates DNA synthesis. We further show that PEPD activates EGFR only when it is present in the extracellular space, but that PEPD is released from injured cells and tissues and that such release appears to result in EGFR activation. PEPD differs from all known EGFR ligands in that it does not possess an epidermal growth factor (EGF) motif and is not synthesized as a transmembrane precursor, but PEPD binding to EGFR can be blocked by EGF. In conclusion, PEPD is a ligand of EGFR and presents a novel mechanism of EGFR activation."

Knockdown of FHL2 by RNA interference decreases Arkadia level and restricts the amplitude of Arkadia-induced TGF-β target gene responses. We found that Arkadia is ubiquitinated via K63- and K27-linked polyubiquitination.

Biotechnol. 2012; 30: 306-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar), during Q2 and Q3 there were four overarching events that will have a positive effect on the sector’s commercial activities in the short and medium term. In July, the US Congress passed the FDA Safety and Innovation Act (FDASIA). This new law includes the reauthorization of the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA 5), expands the existing Accelerated Approval Pathway, and creates a “breakthrough therapies” category for promising new treatments for serious disease to shorten their development timeline (Fox, 2012bFox J.L. Nat. Biotechnol. 2012; 30: 733-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). All these developments are excellent news for cell therapy companies working on innovative therapies. The California Institute for Regenerative Medicine (CIRM) is continuing to expand its funding to commercial organizations (Trounson, 2012Trounson A. Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2012; 11: 512Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar). StemCells (Newark, CA, USA) is one of a number of California-based companies to receive substantial funding. In September, StemCells received an additional $20M to help fund Investigational New Drug (IND) enabling activities for the deployment of human neuronal stem cells (HuCNS-SCs) in Alzheimer’s disease. Under the terms of this CIRM program (RFA 10-05), funding for companies is in the form of unsecured, nonrecourse, interest-bearing term loans, which will be forgivable in the event the funded research fails to result in a commercialized product. However, if the product is successfully commercialized, CIRM would earn beneficial milestone payments depending on the degree of success. This pragmatic funding arrangement enables commercial products to be developed while not diluting the share-holdings of existing shareholders. Up to the end of Q3, CIRM’s governing board approved a total of $1.7B in funding. Cell therapy companies that have benefited include BioTime ($4.7M); Bluebird Bio ($9.4M); Capricor ($19.8M); Escape Therapeutics ($1.5M); StemCells ($40.1M); and ViaCyte (previously Novocell; $26M). CIRM also signed a $25M product-backed loan agreement with the former human embryonic stem cell-based company, Geron, in May 2011 to support their spinal cord injury trial. Geron’s obligation for repayment was to be contingent on the commercial success of their embryonic stem cell-derived oligodendrocyte progenitors for spinal cord injury. Geron received $6.4M of the loan, which the company repaid in full with accrued interest after discontinuing their stem cell program in November 2011. The cell therapy sector continues to attract significant US defense interest. In September, Cytori Therapeutics (San Diego, CA, USA) were awarded a contract worth up to $106M by the US Department of Health and Human Service’s Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA). The funding is for the development of Cytori’s point-of-care processing device (Celution) of adipose-derived stem cells for use in thermal burns with radiation injury. The contract is initially for 2 years but extendable up to 5. BARDA will support all the preclinical, regulatory, clinical, and technology development activities needed to satisfy the FDA’s approval process. Other major defense deals include treatments for acute radiation syndrome with Osiris Therapeutics in 2008 winning a US Department of Defense contract worth up to $225M for Prochymal (adult stem cells) development and procurement, and Cellerant in 2011 being awarded a similar contract from BARDA worth up to $153M to develop and stockpile CLT-008 (myeloid progenitor cells)."
https://openalex.org/W2159330811,"In eukaryotes, proteins are imported into mitochondria via multiprotein translocases of the mitochondrial outer and inner membranes, TOM and TIM, respectively. Trypanosoma brucei, a hemoflagellated parasitic protozoan and the causative agent of African trypanosomiasis, imports about a thousand proteins into the mitochondrion; however, the mitochondrial protein import machinery in this organism is largely unidentified. Here, we characterized a homolog of Tim50 that is localized in the mitochondrial membrane in T. brucei. Similar to Tim50 proteins from fungi and mammals, Tim50 in T. brucei (TbTim50) possesses a mitochondrial targeting signal at its N terminus and a C-terminal domain phosphatase motif at its C terminus. Knockdown of TbTim50 reduced cell growth and inhibited import of proteins that contain N-terminal targeting signals. Co-immunoprecipitation analysis revealed that TbTim50 interacts with TbTim17. Unlike its fungal counterpart but similar to the human homolog of Tim50, recombinant TbTim50 possesses a dual specificity phosphatase activity with a greater affinity for protein tyrosine phosphate than for protein serine/threonine phosphate. Mutation of the aspartic acid residues to alanine in the C-terminal domain phosphatase motif (242)DXDX(V/T)(246) abolished activity for both type of substrates. TbTim50 knockdown increased and its overexpression decreased the level of voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC). However, the VDAC level was unaltered when the phosphatase-inactive mutant of TbTim50 was overexpressed, suggesting that the phosphatase activity of TbTim50 plays a role in regulation of VDAC expression. In contrast, phosphatase activity of the TbTim50 is required neither for mitochondrial protein import nor for its interaction with TbTim17. Overall, our results show that TbTim50 plays additional roles in mitochondrial activities besides preprotein translocation."
https://openalex.org/W1969253181,"Folate deficiency has been associated with many adverse clinical manifestations. The blood-brain barrier (BBB), formed by brain capillary endothelial cells, protects the brain from exposure to neurotoxicants. The function of BBB is modulated by multiple ABC transporters, particularly P-glycoprotein. A proton-coupled folate transporter (PCFT)-deficient mouse has been previously described as a model for systemic folate deficiency. Herein, we demonstrate that exposing mouse brain capillaries to the antiepileptic drug, valproic acid (VPA; 5 μM), significantly increased P-glycoprotein transport function in the wild-type animals. A ligand to the aryl hydrocarbon receptor, 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD), produced a similar induction of P-glycoprotein, which tightened the BBB, thereby increasing the neuroprotection. However, VPA- or TCDD-induced P-glycoprotein transport was blocked in the PCFT-nullizygous mice, indicating that multiple neuroprotective mechanisms are compromised under folate-deficient conditions. Brain capillaries from S-folinic acid (SFA; 40 mg/kg)-treated PCFT-nullizygous mice exhibited increased P-glycoprotein transport following VPA exposure. This suggests that SFA supplementation restored the normal BBB function. In addition, we show that tight-junction proteins are disintegrated in the PCFT mutant mice. Taken together, these findings strongly suggest that folate deficiency disrupts the BBB function by targeting the transporter and tight junctions, which may contribute to the development of neurological disorders."
https://openalex.org/W2056572305,"The minus end-directed microtubule motor cytoplasmic dynein is responsible for the intracellular movements of many organelles, including nuclei and endosomes. The dynein heavy chain contains a C-terminal motor domain and an N-terminal tail domain. The tail binds other dynein subunits and the cargo-interacting dynactin complex but is dispensable for movement of single dynein molecules in vitro. Here, we identified a mutation in the Aspergillus nidulans heavy chain tail domain, nudA(F208V), which causes obvious defects in dynein-mediated nuclear positioning and early endosome movement. Astonishingly, the nudA(F208I) mutation in the same position does not cause the same defects, suggesting that a subtle difference in the size of the amino acid side chain at this position has a significant consequence. Importantly, our biochemical analyses indicate that the nudA(F208V) mutation does not affect dynein subunit interactions and the mutant dynein is also able to bind dynactin and another dynein regulator, NUDF/LIS1. The mutant dynein is able to physically interact with the early endosome cargo, but dynein-mediated early endosome movement away from the hyphal tip occurs at a significantly reduced frequency. Within the small group of early endosomes that move away from the hyphal tip in the mutant, the average speed of movement is lower than that in the wild type. Given the dispensability of the dynein tail in dynein motility in vitro, our results support the notion that the structural integrity of the dynein tail is critical in vivo for the coordination of dynein force production and movement when the motor is heavily loaded."
https://openalex.org/W2002511665,"During the process of branching morphogenesis, the mammary gland undergoes distinct phases of remodeling to form an elaborate ductal network that ultimately produces and delivers milk to newborn animals. These developmental events rely on tight regulation of critical cellular pathways, many of which are probably disrupted during initiation and progression of breast cancer. Transgenic mouse and in vitro organoid models previously identified growth factor signaling as a key regulator of mammary branching, but the functional downstream targets of these pathways remain unclear. Here, we used purified primary mammary epithelial cells stimulated with fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF2) to model mammary branching morphogenesis in vitro. We employed a forward chemical genetic approach to identify modulators of this process and describe a potent compound, 1023, that blocks FGF2-induced branching. In primary mammary epithelial cells, we used lentivirus-mediated knockdown of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) to demonstrate that 1023 acts through AHR to block branching. Using 1023 as a tool, we identified desmosomal adhesion as a novel target of AHR signaling and show that desmosomes are critical for AHR agonists to block branching.

Conclusion: Down-regulation of desmosomes is required for proper mammary branching morphogenesis. Significance: Desmosomes are a novel mechanism through which exposure to environmental pollutants may affect mammary development. Branching morphogenesis is a developmental process that maximizes surface area in order to enhance gas, nutrient, and waste exchange by tissue (1Lu P. Werb Z. Patterning mechanisms of branched organs.Science. 2008; 322: 1506-1509Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Consequently, branching morphogenesis occurs during development of a variety of organs, including Drosophila trachea, mammalian lungs, kidneys, and salivary and mammary glands (2Lu P. Sternlicht M.D. Werb Z. Comparative mechanisms of branching morphogenesis in diverse systems.J. Mammary Gland Biol. Neoplasia. 2006; 11: 213-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Because this developmental event relies on coordination of major cellular processes, including proliferation, invasion, differentiation, and apoptosis (1Lu P. Werb Z. Patterning mechanisms of branched organs.Science. 2008; 322: 1506-1509Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), understanding the pathways that drive branching morphogenesis may lead to discoveries of mechanisms involved in human diseases, such as cancer, where these fundamental cellular pathways are aberrantly regulated. In contrast to other organs, the mammary gland undergoes key stages of development postnatally. Due to its delayed development and capacity to branch in organotypic systems in vitro, the mammary gland is a uniquely accessible model organ of branching morphogenesis (3Smith B.A. Welm A.L. Welm B.E. On the shoulders of giants: A historical perspective of unique experimental methods in mammary gland research.Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2012; 23: 583-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). At birth, the mammary gland consists of a small ductal network embedded in adipose tissue. Hormonal cues stimulate its development during puberty, which results in elongation of ducts that eventually fill the fat pad (4Sternlicht M.D. Key stages in mammary gland development. The cues that regulate ductal branching morphogenesis.Breast Cancer Res. 2006; 8: 201Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Importantly, mammary ducts are composed of an epithelial bilayer, with a basal layer consisting of myoepithelial cells and inner layer of luminal cells. Each layer contains progenitor and differentiated cell populations that are poised to respond to developmental and hormonal changes. During pregnancy, alveolar buds branch from ducts and develop into lobuloalveolar acini, where functionally differentiated luminal cells produce milk during lactation. In addition, differentiated myoepithelial cells contract in response to oxytocin to facilitate milk delivery (5Sternlicht M.D. Kouros-Mehr H. Lu P. Werb Z. Hormonal and local control of mammary branching morphogenesis.Differentiation. 2006; 74: 365-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Cumulatively, mammary branching morphogenesis functions to establish an extensive tubular gland capable of producing and delivering milk to newborn animals. Studies using genetically modified mice and three-dimensional organotypic culture of mammary tissue have identified several molecular pathways important for mammary gland development. Among these pathways, epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor and fibroblast growth factor (FGF) receptor have been shown to be critical drivers of proliferation and invasion, respectively (5Sternlicht M.D. Kouros-Mehr H. Lu P. Werb Z. Hormonal and local control of mammary branching morphogenesis.Differentiation. 2006; 74: 365-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Although these studies support a pivotal role for EGF and FGF signaling in mammary development, the downstream cellular targets of these cascades remain unclear. We sought to develop an in vitro model of mammary development well suited to define intracellular pathways targeted by growth factor signaling. In previously established organotypic models of mammary morphogenesis, fragments of murine mammary epithelium, called organoids, were embedded in extracellular matrix and stimulated with specific growth factors to induce branching (6Fata J.E.

However, organoids are complex tissue structures consisting of both epithelial and stromal cells. As a result, one limitation of these studies is the inability to distinguish the effects of growth factor signaling directly on epithelial cells from the indirect effects exerted through stromal cells. We developed an in vitro three-dimensional branching model consisting of enriched, primary mammary epithelial cells (MECs) 4The abbreviations used are: MECmammary epithelial cellAHRaryl hydrocarbon receptorK8keratin-8K14keratin-14TCDD2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzodioxinARNTaryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocatorDICdifferential interference contrast. and employed a forward chemical genetic screen to identify modulators of branching morphogenesis. We describe a compound, 1023, which effectively blocks FGF2-induced branching while maintaining cells as normal mammary cysts.

Organoids from the fourth inguinal mammary glands were isolated from 8–12-week-old female FVB/n mice as described previously (10Welm B.E. Dijkgraaf G.J. Bledau A.S. Welm A.L. Werb Z. Lentiviral transduction of mammary stem cells for analysis of gene function during development and cancer.Cell Stem Cell. 2008; 2: 90-102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Protocol modifications and dissociation of organoids into single cells are described in the supplemental material. Frozen primary MECs were thawed, washed, and pelleted three times with 5 ml of DMEM/F-12 (HyClone) (150 × g, 3 min) to remove DMSO. To form aggregates, 2 × 106 primary MECs were resuspended in 1 ml of primary MEC growth medium (DMEM/F-12 supplemented with 5 μg/ml ITS-X (Invitrogen), 1 μg/ml hydrocortisone, 10 ng/ml murine EGF (BD Biosciences), 10% FBS (HyClone), and 1× penicillin/streptomycin/glutamine (Invitrogen)) and incubated overnight at 37 °C with 5% CO2 in a 24-well ultra-low attachment tissue culture plate (Costar). After 16 h, stromal contaminants were removed by differential centrifugation as described previously (6Fata J.E. Mori H. Ewald A.J. Zhang H. Yao E. Werb Z. Bissell M.J. The MAPK(ERK-1,2) pathway integrates distinct and antagonistic signals from TGFα and FGF7 in morphogenesis of mouse mammary epithelium.Dev. Biol. 2007; 306: 193-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). To create a base layer, 20 μl of growth factor-reduced Matrigel (BD Biosciences) was plated in the center of each well of a 24-well glass SensoPlate (Greiner Bio-One) and allowed to solidify at 37 °C. Aggregates (250 per well) were plated on top of the hardened base layer in 40 μl of Matrigel per well and incubated at 37 °C with 5% CO2 to solidify Matrigel. Embedded aggregates were cultured in DMEM/F-12 supplemented with 5 μg/ml ITS-X, 1× penicillin/streptomycin/glutamine, and either murine EGF or human FGF2 (Invitrogen) (2.5 nm unless otherwise indicated). 1023, 1023-CF3, and 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzodioxin (TCDD) were added as indicated. Cells were incubated at 37 °C with 5% CO2 with medium changes every 48 h. When single cells were cultured in Matrigel, 2,500 single trypsinized primary MECs were embedded in 40 μl of Matrigel per well of a 24-well plate. For peptide experiments, aggregates were plated on top of Matrigel as described previously (11Lee G.Y. Kenny P.A. Lee E.H. Bissell M.J. Three-dimensional culture models of normal and malignant breast epithelial cells.Nat. Methods. 2007; 4: 359-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (988) Google Scholar). Briefly, 50 μl of Matrigel was plated in each well of a 96-well plate and incubated at 37 °C to harden. Aggregates (250 per well) were resuspended in 100 μl of medium containing 2% Matrigel and plated on top of the base layer. We used this overlay technique to ensure that the peptides could access aggregates. To calculate the percentage of branching in all assays, samples were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and imaged with bright field microscopy at low magnification (×4). At least 100 aggregates/well were scored, with branching counted as three ducts or more, as established previously in organoid culture models (6Fata J.E. Mori H. Ewald A.J. Zhang H. Yao E. Werb Z. Bissell M.J. The MAPK(ERK-1,2) pathway integrates distinct and antagonistic signals from TGFα and FGF7 in morphogenesis of mouse mammary epithelium.Dev. Biol. 2007; 306: 193-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). At least 3 independent samples/condition were averaged for each experiment. Compound stocks were obtained from the University of Utah Department of Chemistry Collection and diluted to 10 μm in serum-free medium (DMEM/F-12 supplemented with 5 μg/ml ITS-X, 1× penicillin/streptomycin/glutamine, and 2.5 nm human FGF2). Aggregates were embedded as described above in 48-well tissue culture plates (BD Biosciences) with a 5-μl Matrigel base layer and 200 aggregates suspended in 10 μl of Matrigel on top. Medium was replaced with fresh compound-containing medium after 72 h in culture. After 144 h total, cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, and an Olympus CKX41 inverted microscope was used to score each compound based on the phenotype observed in greater than 50% of aggregates in each well. Sequence alignment, homology modeling, and molecular docking of 1023 with human AHR is described in detail in the supplemental material. RNA sequences (supplemental Table S2) for shRNA Ahr or Arnt (aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator) knockdown were designed using the Dharmacon siDESIGN Center (available on the Thermo Scientific Web site). Oligonucleotides were annealed and ligated into HpaI and XhoI sites in pLentiLox5.0-GFP (12Cai L. Marshall T.W. Uetrecht A.C. Schafer D.A. Bear J.E.

Lentivirus was produced and titrated as previously described (10Welm B.E. Dijkgraaf G.J. Bledau A.S. Welm A.L. Werb Z.

All values are shown as means ± S.E. or S.D., as indicated. p values were determined using Student's t test with two-tailed distribution and unequal variance. Additional methodology is provided in the supplementary material. To study the direct effect of growth factor signaling on epithelial cells, we developed a three-dimensional branching assay using isolated primary MECs devoid of stromal components. Primary MECs were prepared as single cells from the fourth inguinal mammary glands of 8–12-week-old FVB/n mice. Dissociated primary MECs were cultured in suspension to allow aggregation of epithelial cells, and after 16 h, the cell clusters were enriched from stromal cells by differential centrifugation as described previously (6Fata J.E. Mori H. Ewald A.J. Zhang H. Yao E. Werb Z. Bissell M.J. The MAPK(ERK-1,2) pathway integrates distinct and antagonistic signals from TGFα and FGF7 in morphogenesis of mouse mammary epithelium.Dev. Biol. 2007; 306: 193-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). The MEC aggregates were embedded in Matrigel and grown in culture for 144 h in serum-free medium supplemented with either EGF or FGF2. In this assay, aggregates cultured with either growth factor underwent considerable reorganization, motility, and proliferation (Fig. 1, A and B). However, EGF and FGF2 induced distinct differences in morphology. Unlike in vitro organoid cultures (7Simian M. Hirai Y. Navre M. Werb Z. Lochter A. Bissell M.J. The interplay of matrix metalloproteinases, morphogens, and growth factors is necessary for branching of mammary epithelial cells.Development. 2001; 128: 3117-3131PubMed Google Scholar), aggregated primary MECs in our assay did not branch efficiently in the presence of EGF and predominately formed hollow cysts with a fluid-filled lumen (Fig. 1A). The significantly reduced branching observed with EGF further supports its role as an indirect mediator of branching (8Sternlicht M.D. Sunnarborg S.W. Kouros-Mehr H. Yu Y. Lee D.C. Werb Z. Mammary ductal morphogenesis requires paracrine activation of stromal EGFR via ADAM17-dependent shedding of epithelial amphiregulin.Development. 2005; 132: 3923-3933Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 15Wiesen J.F. Young P. Werb Z. Cunha G.R. Signaling through the stromal epidermal growth factor receptor is necessary for mammary ductal development.Development. 1999; 126: 335-344Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and is in agreement with the lack of stromal cells in our aggregate culture model (10Welm B.E. Dijkgraaf G.J. Bledau A.S. Welm A.L. Werb Z. Lentiviral transduction of mammary stem cells for analysis of gene function during development and cancer.Cell Stem Cell. 2008; 2: 90-102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) compared with the organoid model (16Ewald A.J. Brenot A. Duong M. Chan B.S. Werb Z. Collective epithelial migration and cell rearrangements drive mammary branching morphogenesis.Dev. Cell. 2008; 14: 570-581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar). In contrast to EGF, FGF2 stimulated extensive branching of MECs (Fig. 1B), which is consistent with the robust branching phenotype elicited by activation of the FGF receptor in mammary epithelial cells in vivo (17Welm B.E. Freeman K.W. Chen M. Contreras A. Spencer D.M. Rosen J.M. Inducible dimerization of FGFR1. Development of a mouse model to analyze progressive transformation of the mammary gland.J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 703-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). To determine the optimal concentration of FGF2 required to stimulate branching in the aggregate model, we performed a dose-response analysis and found the half-maximal effective concentration (EC50) for FGF2-induced branching to be 0.41 ± 0.053 nm (Fig. 1C). Based on these results, we used 2.5 nm growth factor for all subsequent assays, which was the minimum concentration required to achieve maximal branching. At this concentration, 56.4% of primary MECs branched in the presence of FGF2 compared with only 8.9% with EGF (Fig. 1D). We next used immunofluorescence to assess the cellular architecture of cyst and branched structures. Both EGF and FGF2 induced a cellular organization similar to that observed in vivo. Immunofluorescence staining showed that like in vivo mammary ducts (Fig. 1E), EGF-induced cysts were composed of an epithelial bilayer (Fig. 1F), with keratin-8 (K8)-positive luminal epithelial cells surrounded by keratin-14 (K14)-positive myoepithelial cells. In branched structures induced by FGF2, we found K8-positive luminal epithelial cells invading into the Matrigel at branch points and K14-positive myoepithelial cells retained at points of constriction at the base of branches (Fig. 1G), which is consistent with previous studies showing that branch points arise at breaks in the myoepithelial layer (16Ewald A.J. Brenot A. Duong M. Chan B.S. Werb Z. Collective epithelial migration and cell rearrangements drive mammary branching morphogenesis.Dev. Cell. 2008; 14: 570-581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar). Thus, our aggregate-based model recapitulated key aspects of in vivo mammary branching morphogenesis and allowed us to uncouple epithelial induced morphogenesis from stromal mediated events. With our three-dimensional assay, we next conducted a chemical genetic screen to identify strong modulators of branching, with the goal to use these compounds to elucidate signaling pathways in epithelial cells critical for this developmental process. We were specifically interested in compounds that completely blocked FGF2-induced invasion yet maintained the normal, bilayered morphology of the growing aggregate. Thus, we were interested in compounds that induced cyst morphology similar to EGF-treated aggregates. We hypothesized that compounds causing cyst arrest in FGF2-treated aggregates would more specifically target invasion rather than growth-stimulating pathways. 587 compounds from the University of Utah Chemistry Department Collection were screened in the FGF2 branching assay. Six dominant phenotypes were observed (Fig. 2, A and B): normal branching, hyperbranching, reduced branching, cyst arrest, filled, and cytotoxic. Additionally, 6% of compounds caused a mixed phenotype consisting of two or more dominant characteristics (Fig. 2B). The most potent compound that caused cyst arrest, a diphenyl oxadiazole named 1023 (Fig. 2C), exhibited an EC50 of 1.2 ± 0.050 μm in our branching assay (Fig. 2D) and had no significant toxicity or effect on growth compared with DMSO treatment (vehicle control) (Fig. 2E and supplemental Movies S1 and S2). The effect of impairing branching while simultaneously maintaining normal cyst growth (supplemental Fig. S1) suggested 1023 was a specific modulator of FGF2-induced branching. Thus, we reasoned that elucidating the target of 1023 would lead to better understanding of the molecular mechanisms downstream of FGF2 during mammary branching morphogenesis. For insight into the biological mechanism of action of 1023, we evaluated alterations in gene expression following compound treatment. We conducted microarray gene expression analysis on primary MECs grown in Matrigel for 72 h with FGF2 and either DMSO or 10 μm 1023. Compared with DMSO, 1023 highly up-regulated Cyp1a1, Ahrr, Gsta3, Aldh3a1, Nqo1, Cyp1b1, and Ugt-1a (Table 1, boldface type), an expression profile known to be induced by activation of AHR (18Tijet N.

However, a growing number of studies suggest that AHR has a wider physiologic role in regulating critical cellular processes, including proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis (22Furness S.G.

To assess AHR as a potential target of 1023, we used a homology model structure of human AHR to predict binding modes of 1023 (24Motto I. Bordogna A. Soshilov A.A. Denison M.S. Bonati L. New aryl hydrocarbon receptor homology model targeted to improve docking reliability.J. Chem. Inf. Model. 2011; 51: 2868-2881Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Using the lowest energy conformer, 1023 was predicted to bind AHR with a free energy of −20.83 kcal/mol (Fig. 3A), which suggested a strong interaction between 1023 and AHR. In addition to van der Waals contacts, our modeling predicted Phe-287, His-291, Phe-324, Cys-300, His-337, and Gln-383 in the AHR binding cavity significantly contributed to the binding mode of 1023 through hydrogen bonding and other non-bonded contacts. Furthermore, the modeling data indicated that the addition of a trifluoromethyl group to the phenyl ring of 1023 would drastically reduce its ability to bind AHR due to steric clashes with His-291 and Phe-287. As a result, we synthesized the 1023-CF3 analog (Fig. 3B, top), which had a predicted binding energy of −11.21 kcal/mol, to use as a negative control in our assays. With AHR as the putative cellular target of 1023, we hypothesized that TCDD (Fig. 3B, bottom), a widespread environmental pollutant and known activator of AHR (25Fernandez-Salguero P.M. Hilbert D.M. Rudikoff S. Ward J.M. Gonzalez F.J. Aryl-hydrocarbon receptor-deficient mice are resistant to 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin-induced toxicity.Toxicol. Appl.

Acta. 2003; 1619: 263-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar), would phenocopy 1023. In our three-dimensional branching assay, TCDD blocked branching of primary MECs (EC50 = 3.93 ± 0.17 pm) (Fig. 3C) and induced a strong cyst arrest phenotype (Fig. 3E, top right), similar to 1023 (Fig. 3E, bottom left). In contrast, 1023-CF3 did not efficiently block branching (EC50 = 71.1 ± 1.9 μm) compared with 1023 (EC50 = 1.2 ± 0.05 μm) (Fig. 3, D and E, bottom panels), as predicted by our modeling data. These results suggested that activation of AHR is sufficient to block mammary branching morphogenesis in vitro. We next probed the AHR pathway to verify that 1023 was a strong activator of AHR. Following ligand binding, AHR undergoes nuclear translocation, dimerizes with ARNT, and activates transcription of downstream target genes (19Denison M.S. Nagy S.R.

Toxicol. 2003; 43: 309-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (1436) Google Scholar, 27Heid S.E. Pollenz R.S. Swanson H.I.

To do so, we expressed an HA-tagged AHR construct, pACTAG2-HA-AHR, in HEK-293T cells. After 24 h of drug treatment, we performed immunofluorescence for HA and found that both 10 nm TCDD and 10 μm 1023 significantly increased the amount of nuclear AHR compared with DMSO or 10 μm 1023-CF3 (Fig. 3F and s"

The two winners of the 2012 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine share more than just this honor; they are both also fearless adventurers, in science and beyond. This year’s Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine was awarded to John Gurdon and Shinya Yamanaka for solving key problems of biology. Their work provided fundamental insights into how an egg gives rise to a complex organism consisting of many different cell types and has transformed our understanding of nuclear reprogramming, of embryonic development, and of cellular differentiation. These are issues that have a long history and the reader is referred to a comprehensive review by Graf, 2011Graf T. Cell Stem Cell. 2011; 9: 504-516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar on cellular plasticity and a summary of current issues of the reprogramming field by Yamanaka, 2012Yamanaka S. Cell Stem Cell. 2012; 10: 678-684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar. Here I will give a personal view on how the discoveries of Gurdon and Yamanaka have shaped our understanding of basic mechanisms of development and how stem cells will revolutionize the way we investigate human disease and establish novel treatment strategies. For the longest time, biologists tried to unveil the process of how a fertilized egg creates an organism that consists of hundreds of specialized cell types that are all expressing different sets of genes. Development of an embryo to the adult was seen as a unidirectional process, and the differentiated state of specialized cells like skin or liver cells as fixed irreversibly. How specific combinations of proteins could be synthesized and maintained in different cell types needed an explanation. Two competing hypotheses were envisioned. August Weissmann and Wilhelm Roux proposed in the late 19th century that cells become different by selective loss of genetic material that was not needed and retain only those genes essential for the function of the respective tissue, as has been seen in some animal species. The second hypothesis posed that differentiated cells may retain all genes but regulate their expression in a tissue-specific manner. Gurdon and Yamanaka’s seminal work resolved these questions. We now know that the genome is conserved during development, and that the differentiated state is reversible. Moreover, in the process Gurdon and Yamanaka shed light on the nature of stem cells and pluripotency. Though interested in science from a young age, Gurdon’s entrance into biological science was highly discouraged by his biology teacher, who said of Gurdon, “While having ideas to become a scientist, this is quite ridiculous as judged from his present showing: he can’t even learn simple biological facts and would have no chance of doing the work of a specialist and it would be a waste of time, both on his part and of those who have to teach him.” A prophecy that now makes us smile! A stringent prediction of the Weissmann-Roux concept was that nuclei of differentiated cells would lose the ability to generate a new organism. In contrast, if all genes were retained and the process of differentiation was reversible, a somatic nucleus would maintain the potential to form a new organism when transplanted into the egg. In 1952 Briggs and King performed the first successful nuclear transfer (NT) experiments in the frog Rana pipiens. When nuclei from cleavage embryos were used as donors they obtained swimming tadpoles, but later stage nuclei had lost this potential and formed only abnormal clones. They concluded that differentiation involves irreversible nuclear changes and the production of animals by nuclear cloning from somatic donors would be impossible, and that conclusion became generally accepted in the field until John Gurdon made his crucial discovery. Working as a student in the laboratory of embryologist Michail Fischberg, Gurdon decided to test the Weissman-Roux hypothesis in Xenopus rather than Rana eggs. For practical reasons this was an excellent choice because Xenopus, in contrast to Rana, can produce eggs all year round. His early experiments challenged the conclusions of Briggs and King: nuclei derived from intestinal cells of tadpoles, when injected into the egg, were able to direct development to mature adults (Gurdon, 1960Gurdon J.B. J. Embryol. Exp. Morphol. 1960; 8: 505-526PubMed Google Scholar; Gurdon and Uehlinger, 1966Gurdon J.B. Uehlinger V. Nature. 1966; 210: 1240-1241Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). This seminal discovery made a persuasive case that development does not in fact involve irreversible genetic changes. It took 30 years for Keith Campbell and Ian Wilmut to repeat this experiment in mammals by generating Dolly, the first cloned mammal derived by transfer of an adult somatic nucleus into an enucleated sheep egg (Wilmut et al., 1997Wilmut I. Schnieke A.E. McWhir J. Kind A.J. Campbell K.H. Nature. 1997; 385: 810-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (4045) Google Scholar). To prove that nuclei of mature adult cells rather than tissue stem cells retained totipotency, Gurdon used expression of tissue-specific markers in the donor cells. However, because cloning was so inefficient the question of whether nuclei of mature adult cells were indeed totipotent was only settled later when it was shown that all cells of cloned mice harbored the appropriate IgG or T cell receptor gene rearrangements when derived from mature B or T donor cells (Hochedlinger and Jaenisch, 2002Hochedlinger K. Jaenisch R. Nature. 2002; 415: 1035-1038Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). The molecular mechanism of nuclear reprogramming by the egg has been of great interest to biologists and has largely remained unsolved even today. Because of the egg’s small size, biochemical analyses of the reprogramming process in the mammalian egg are difficult. Gurdon realized early that the Xenopus oocyte, in contrast to the mammalian system, would provide a better opportunity. He used the Xenopus egg as a living test tube and showed, for example, that nuclei from differentiated cells, when transferred into the oocyte, silenced genes expressed in the somatic donor cell and activated oocyte-specific genes (De Robertis and Gurdon, 1977De Robertis E.M. Gurdon J.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1977; 74: 2470-2474Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The important conclusion was entirely consistent with differential gene expression driving development because it showed that genes, which had become inactive during cell differentiation, can be reactivated by normal components of the oocyte cytoplasm in the absence of cell division. These experiments were performed in the 1970s at a time before today’s routine molecular tests such as Southern analysis, PCR, or genomic analyses had been invented, yet the conclusions have stood the test of time. In more recent years Gurdon introduced mammalian nuclei into the Xenopus oocyte and, using modern experimental tools, has embarked on defining molecular events of early stages in nuclear reprogramming. Given the different developmental strategies of frog and mammal it will be important though challenging to confirm that conclusions from these interspecies experiments accurately reflect what happens to the mammalian nucleus when transferred into the mammalian egg. When I first read about NT, I was deeply impressed by the elegance and the boldness of Gurdon’s experiments and later by the clarity of his lectures. It may come as no surprise that he is as passionate and fearless outside of science. He used to bicycle 20 km to work, still plays tennis and competitive squash, and has made adventurous treks to the high mountains. For example, in search of Meconopsis, a beautiful poppy plant that only blooms in the monsoon season at an altitude of 14,000 feet, he embarked on long and treacherous treks into the high mountains of India. In the 1990s he trekked into the mountains of New Guinea, completed the Haute Route (a demanding 7 day ski trek though the high French and Swiss Alps), and climbed Mt. Harvard, one of the highest peaks in the Rockies (see photos). Ten years ago he decided it was time to learn parachute jumping, an idea provoked by one of his students who had become an expert in this activity. His first jump was 1 day before his daughter’s wedding and 1 week after a lethal accident had occurred due to the failure of a chute to open, all circumstances that, as he told me, caused his wife some concern. A water skiing accident necessitating hip replacement has not dampened his resolve to plan a serious hiking trip into the Himalayas to see rhododendrons in bloom. Today, at 79 years of age, Gurdon retains the skills to inject nuclei and comes every day to the lab to do his experiments. He occupies a small office that also houses his microscope. Because the University does not allow the placement of scientific instruments in an office, he has declared his office to be his laboratory, which just happens to also contain his desk. Gurdon’s classic NT experiments established for the first time that nuclei of differentiated cells remain totipotent and retain the potential to produce a new organism. His experiments did not address whether differentiated cells can be reprogrammed back to an undifferentiated pluripotent state. The answer to this question would come from the work of Shinya Yamanaka. In the late 1990s, two breakthroughs stirred the scientific community as well as the public: the generation of Dolly, the first mammal cloned from an adult donor cell, and the derivation of human embryonic stem cells (ESCs) by Jamie Thomson (Thomson et al., 1998Thomson J.A. Itskovitz-Eldor J. Shapiro S.S. Waknitz M.A. Swiergiel J.J. Marshall V.S. Jones J.M. Science. 1998; 282: 1145-1147Crossref PubMed Scopus (12317) Google Scholar). Together these discoveries raised the possibility of customized therapy for human degenerative ailments such as Parkinson’s or heart disease with what was dubbed “therapeutic cloning.” The idea was that patient-specific pluripotent ESCs could be obtained by NT of a skin cell nucleus into a human egg, which then would be differentiated to the cell type that was defective in the patient. The differentiated cells would be transplanted back into the patient to cure the underlying disease without the complication of immune rejection. While therapeutic cloning was shown to work in animals, its application to humans faced serious technical, practical, and ethical obstacles that subsequent work has still not been able to overcome (Hyun, 2011Hyun I. Cell Stem Cell. 2011; 9: 295-297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Importantly, it was inconceivable that sufficient numbers of human eggs could ever be obtained for any medical application. Finally, serious moral objections were raised to using human eggs and cloned embryos for research and therapy. Thus, the only option was to understand how the egg accomplishes the resetting of the somatic genome to a pluripotent state, which would circumvent the need to use human eggs in the process. The mechanism of nuclear reprogramming during cloning became a hot research aim that captivated many laboratories. It is here where Yamanaka made his groundbreaking discovery. During his high school years, Yamanaka practiced judo and earned a black belt. He enrolled in medical school, where his focus was on playing rugby (see photos) at the expense, as he told me, of attending classes. Serious practice of judo and rugby is tough on the body, and he suffered numerous bone fractures necessitating intimate and painful exposure to medicine as patient. These experiences convinced him to pursue a medical career and become an orthopedic surgeon. However, medical school was not to his liking: he had to follow textbooks and supervisors closely. Nevertheless, he finished medical school and got his M.D. degree, only to realize that surgery and the manual dexterity involved were not his calling. Instead, he decided to study for a Ph.D. in pharmacology. Excited by the isolation of human ESCs and their potential for medicine, he set out to define the molecular determinants of the pluripotent state. The mammalian egg is about 1,000× larger than a somatic cell and harbors numerous gene products that are crucial for the early development of the embryo and, it was assumed, for reprogramming the somatic nucleus after NT. It was a daunting task to identify which of the many proteins present in the egg might be responsible for resetting the somatic cell genome back into an embryonic state. In the early 2000s several laboratories had defined the key factors responsible for the maintenance of ESCs with the transcription factors Oct4, Sox2, and Nanog being at the top of an autoregulatory gene expression circuitry required for pluripotency and self-renewal. While this discovery suggested to many that expression of these genes in somatic cells would be essential to induce reprogramming, they surely were not deemed sufficient on their own—the process had to be far more complex. Yamanaka dropped a bombshell on the field at the 2006 ISSCR meeting in Toronto when he announced that only four transcription factors were needed to reprogram a somatic nucleus to pluripotency. Kazutoshi Takahashi, a student in his lab, had performed an experiment that seemed unlikely to succeed. From a list of genes expressed in ESCs, but not in somatic cells, they had selected 24 candidates, which were packaged into retroviral vectors and cotransduced into fibroblasts that carried a neo resistance marker in the Fbx15 gene. Fbx15 is downstream of Oct4 and is not expressed in fibroblasts but is active in pluripotent ESCs. If any combination of the 24 candidate genes could induce reprogramming, the rare reprogrammed cell would become neomycin resistant and thus could be isolated (Takahashi and Yamanaka, 2006Takahashi K. Yamanaka S. Cell. 2006; 126: 663-676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18935) Google Scholar). From the point of view of a retrovirologist, as I am by training, this scheme seemed bold and unlikely to work because cotransduction of multiple genes into a single cell would be exceedingly unlikely. However, because of the strong selection, they were able to isolate reprogrammed cells designated as “induced Pluripotent Stem” cells (iPSCs) by transduction of only four genes: Oct4 and Sox2 and the oncogenes c-Myc and Klf4. While the importance of Oct4 and Sox2 was more or less predictable, the choice of c-Myc and Klf4 was, in my judgment, brilliant. As it turned out later, the two oncogenes are not required for reprogramming, but they made the process more efficient, and made detection of rare reprogrammed cells possible. Yamanaka’s talk at the ISSCR meeting was met with disbelief and skepticism by most: impossible that reprogramming was that simple! Knowing Yamanaka and his rigorous scientific standards, I was convinced immediately. But the iPSCs reported in the initial landmark publication were not equivalent to ESCs: they had not activated the endogenous pluripotency circuitry and were unable to generate chimeras. A year later, using a modified approach, three groups, including Yamanaka’s, reported the generation of iPSCs that were indistinguishable from ESCs. Confirmation from three independent labs convinced the community and led to an explosion of the reprogramming field. Five months after that, several groups reported reprogramming of human cells, attesting to the robustness of the Yamanaka approach. The prospect of using human iPSCs for disease research and for cell-based therapy has electrified the scientific community and beyond, generating much excitement and expectation among the general public. Nuclear reprogramming by NT versus reprogramming initiated by transcription factors raised an interesting question: how similar or different are the molecular mechanisms that reset the genome? Has direct reprogramming by transcription factors really taught us how the egg achieves epigenetic resetting of the somatic nucleus after NT? It had been established early on that pluripotency factors are reactivated within one or two cell divisions after NT into the mouse egg or without DNA replication after transfer of somatic nuclei into the Xenopus oocyte (see, for example, De Robertis and Gurdon, 1977De Robertis E.M. Gurdon J.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1977; 74: 2470-2474Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, and later work from the Gurdon lab). In contrast, direct reprogramming is inefficient and iPSCs appear only after multiple cell divisions. Thus, it was postulated that the molecular mechanism in NT and direct reprogramming would be very different: reprogramming by NT might be a “deterministic” process resulting in rapid hierarchical activation of pluripotency genes, in contrast to iPSC formation that requires multiple “stochastic” or probabilistic epigenetic events that only accumulate after many cycles of DNA replication. However, there is still much to learn about the mechanisms that underlie reprogramming, and recent studies have suggested that direct reprogramming takes place in distinct stages and may well have a more deterministic component than previously assumed. The concept that ectopic expression of transcription factors can reprogram somatic cells to pluripotency was soon extended and applied to converting cells from one somatic lineage to another, a process called “transdifferentiation.” The idea that key transcription factors can change the differentiation state of a cell had been established in principle some time before (as described by Graf, 2011Graf T. Cell Stem Cell. 2011; 9: 504-516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). For example, conversion of fibroblasts into muscle cells by transfection of MyoD by Harold Weintraub or Pu-1-mediated conversion of lymphoid cells into macrophages by Thomas Graf were among the first demonstrations that a single transcription factor could convert one cell type into another. Although the early experiments achieved conversion of cells within a given lineage, more recent studies have applied the Yamanaka approach to transdifferentiate cells of one germ layer to that of another, such as fibroblasts to neurons or liver cells. The approach has even been extended to the in vivo conversion of exocrine to endocrine pancreas cells (for details of these and the early experiments, see Graf, 2011Graf T. Cell Stem Cell. 2011; 9: 504-516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Successful transdifferentiation was inspired by Yamanaka’s discovery of inducing reprogramming with several transcription factors and shows that the iPSC approach has significance beyond just the conversion of somatic to pluripotent cells. The most immediate application of iPSC technology is the study of human disease: iPSCs derived from a given patient carry all genetic determinants that have contributed to the disease and thus represent an unparalleled system to study the etiology of diseases in the Petri dish. They also offer screening for potential drugs and might be used for cell-based therapy at some point in the future. Although technical issues pertaining to the significance of genetic and epigenetic differences between ESCs and iPSCs and a number of safety concerns still need to be resolved, and robust protocols for the differentiation of iPSCs into functional cells need to be developed (for detailed discussion see Yamanaka, 2012Yamanaka S. Cell Stem Cell. 2012; 10: 678-684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar), it is a safe prediction that this approach will change the way we will investigate and treat diseases. The direct reprogramming of somatic cells with only a few transcription factors has fundamental medical implications and arguably represents the most important finding in the stem cell field since Gurdon’s demonstration of reprogramming by nuclear transplantation. It took Gurdon 50 years after his original discovery and Yamanaka a mere 6 years to be recognized by the highest scientific honor. This difference, I believe, reflects the breathtaking progress in the stem cell field following the first report on iPSCs, and the likely unprecedented impact that iPSC technology will have on medicine in the years to come. I thank E. De Robertis, D. Melton, and A. Coleman for some insider details; A. Fleckenstein and members of my lab for comments; and J. Gurdon and S. Yamanaka for information and photos."

The discovery that phenotypic diversity among differentiated cells results from epigenetic and not genetic differences, and can be reset to restore pluripotency, promises revolutionary advances in medicine. I discuss how this and related seminal discoveries have brought us to an exciting future. Immortality comes in many forms. For example, the creators of great works of art that become ingrained in human consciousness achieve immortality through collective appreciation. John Gurdon and Shinya Yamanaka, who received the 2012 Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine for their groundbreaking work on “the discovery that mature cells can be reprogrammed to become pluripotent,” have deservedly achieved immortality for another reason—their research—and the work they have been engaged in is nothing less than an attempt to turn the developmental clock back to the time when we start our individual journeys from a single cell. Development is unidirectional; individual cells do not return to the point from where they start; instead they differentiate to terminal states and then ultimately succumb to aging and disease. Throughout this complex process, cells by and large retain the same genetic information they had at the start. This statement sounds so obvious now, but this was not clear in 1962 when John Gurdon published his findings (Gurdon, 1962Gurdon J.B. J. Embryol. Exp. Morphol. 1962; 10: 622-640PubMed Google Scholar) and established the principle that cells do not lose genetic information when they differentiate. He showed that individual cells can be reprogrammed back to the point from where they can recapitulate their developmental history. This founding principle was important for the inspired work of Yamanaka in 2006, whose simple and elegant approach has made it possible to convert any adult mammalian cell into an induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) (Takahashi and Yamanaka, 2006Takahashi K. Yamanaka S. Cell. 2006; 126: 663-676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18820) Google Scholar), and has revolutionized and accelerated research on stem cells in a way that we could not have foreseen just a few short years ago. The combined endeavor in the field also seeks to explore and answer fundamental questions in biology, such as how cells acquire and maintain their different states. If we can understand this regulation, and as a result manipulate cellular states experimentally, we could unlock the potential to provide great advances in human medicine. Aldous Huxley’s 1932 science fiction book Brave New World depicts a future with human clones of different classes occupying diverse societal niches in a hierarchical order. Nearly 30 years later, John Gurdon’s work on cloning in Xenopus brought reality a little closer to science fiction when he showed that, when transplanted into a Xenopus egg devoid of its own genetic material, a differentiated intestinal cell nucleus can acquire totipotency and develop into a living individual. Using this approach, it is possible to generate an endless number of genetically identical animals. This simple but elegant experiment is notable because it clarified an issue that others, including Briggs and King in early 1950s, were exploring, which was to establish whether cells as they differentiate retain the complete genetic information they were endowed with at the beginning. It was clear at the time that this fundamental discovery in Xenopus should in theory apply to mammals, so it is surprising that despite strenuous efforts by many groups, including that of Steen Willadsen and Davor Solter, it took another 35 years to move from theory to reality. It was not until 1996 that we had an unequivocal demonstration that the same principle applies in mammals, when Ian Wilmut, Keith Campbell, and their colleagues showed with Dolly the sheep that adult mammalian cells could indeed be reprogrammed when transplanted into oocytes and acquire totipotency (Campbell et al., 1996Campbell K.H. McWhir J. Ritchie W.A. Wilmut I. Nature. 1996; 380: 64-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (1467) Google Scholar). Numerous mammalian species such as pigs and cows have now been cloned, including and famously a “copy cat,” aptly called Cc (for carbon copy). This work clearly showed that cellular differentiation involves epigenetic rather than genetic modifications to generate the myriad of differentiated cells that emerge from a totipotent zygote. The term “epigenetic” has come into vogue more recently, although Conrad Waddington used it initially in 1954 in his famous and frequently invoked “epigenetic landscape.” Importantly, epigenetic modifications, unlike genetic changes, can be erased, manipulated, and reinitiated, and logically, therefore, one cell type could be converted to another cell type. Why did it take so long to clone a mammal? The difficulty was partly technical, owing to the necessity of micromanipulation of small and fragile mammalian oocytes, but another important component, as in all things to do with development, was a matter of getting the timing right. The study on cloned sheep provided the much needed impetus to pursue the mechanism of reprogramming, which became the focus of intense interest and activity especially after Yanagimachi established cloning in the experimentally more tractable mice in 1998, which generated many new ideas through the work of Jaenisch and others. Nonetheless, the mechanism of reprogramming of somatic nuclei still remains to be fully elucidated. Cloning in mammals induced some strong reactions, as it raised the prospect of human cloning and, for some, an opportunity to seek “immortality” for themselves. To stem growing public concerns, a nonbinding United Nations Declaration called for the ban of all forms of human cloning in 2005. So, is this the end of the matter? There was a time, unimaginable now, that the pursuit of human in vitro fertilization (IVF) and IVF babies, for which Robert Edward received a Nobel Prize in 2010, was viewed with intense hostility both by the public and by some prominent scientists because of concerns that the procedure could result in the birth of deformed babies. Yet, since the birth of Louise Brown, the first “test tube baby” in 1978 (Steptoe and Edwards, 1978Steptoe P.C. Edwards R.G. Lancet. 1978; 2: 366Abstract PubMed Google Scholar), there are now 5 million IVF babies worldwide. It is important to note that the derivation of human pluripotent stem cells was also helped by IVF, which was the source of blastocysts used for this work, and that IVF has also led to the great advances in prenatal genetic diagnosis. Recent work has also raised the possibility of dealing with the devastating consequences of inheritance of defective mitochondria by using cloning techniques to transplant pronuclei from patients with defective zygotes into normal enucleated donor oocytes with normal mitochondria. A new program along these lines funded by the Wellcome Trust at Newcastle University may potentially eradicate defective mitochondria permanently from afflicted families. Parallel but unrelated studies that were crucial building blocks for this year’s Nobel Prize had unexpected and unusual origins. In the 1950s, Leroy Stevens found that a certain mouse strain was prone to development of enormous testicular tumors, which consisted of many differentiated somatic cell types (Stevens and Little, 1954Stevens L.C. Little C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1954; 40: 1080-1087Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). He subsequently showed that these testicular teratomas could originate from primordial germ cells (PGCs), the precursors of sperm and eggs. These studies eventually led to the identification of embryonal carcinoma cells (ECCs) from teratomas, with the demonstration that a single ECC can form a teratoma; ECCs can therefore be thought of as cancer stem cells. Notably, like single cells of the inner cell mass of blastocysts, an ECC introduced into a host blastocyst is capable of differentiating into many diverse cell types, illustrating its pluripotent character. Human ECCs were also identified and were the subject of investigations. Thus, significant discoveries can have unexpected origins, and can be the foundation of entire and important new fields of research. Despite the germ cell origin of at least some apparently pluripotent ECCs, ECCs themselves were never unequivocally shown to give rise to germ cells. However, the work on ECCs concentrated attention on important questions, and helped to establish basic approaches and culture conditions that became critical for the quest toward alternative ways of isolating pluripotent stem cells. The work on ECCs in many ways set the scene for what followed, which were attempts to derive pluripotent stem cells by another route. The work of Martin Evans and Matt Kaufmann in Cambridge, and Gail Martin at UCSF in California, built on insights from the ECC studies. These researchers independently reported the derivation of embryonic stem cells (ESCs) from the inner cell mass of blastocysts in 1981(Evans and Kaufman, 1981Evans M.J. Kaufman M.H. Nature. 1981; 292: 154-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (6423) Google Scholar; Martin, 1981Martin G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1981; 78: 7634-7638Crossref PubMed Scopus (4288) Google Scholar). The cells they established showed the properties of self-renewal and the potential to differentiate into all cell types, including germ cells. The transmission of ESCs through the germline became the focus of major attention because they provided an important tool for gene targeting, gene traps, and for generating reporters, and thus for major advances in mammalian developmental biology and, ultimately, to the creation of mouse models for human diseases. This advance was recognized by the award of the Nobel Prize to Capecchi, Evans, and Smithies in 2007. It took nearly 18 years after the establishment of mouse ESCs before James Thomson first isolated and established human pluripotent stem cells (Thomson et al., 1998Thomson J.A. Itskovitz-Eldor J. Shapiro S.S. Waknitz M.A. Swiergiel J.J. Marshall V.S. Jones J.M. Science. 1998; 282: 1145-1147Crossref PubMed Scopus (12258) Google Scholar). While not absolutely identical, mouse and human ESCs are by and large similar. The derivation of human ESCs changed the perception of these cells from being a tool for developmental biologists to being cells with a huge potential for advances in medicine, because it became possible to imagine that ESCs could be used to generate any cell type for therapeutic purposes. The work on the biology and properties of ESCs themselves was being pursued by relatively few scientists, notably and particularly by Austin Smith. These studies emerged from the background and moved to center stage, with increasing efforts being directed toward defining specific culture conditions, and identifying transcription factors, such as Oct4, Sox2, and Nanog, that are essential for pluripotency. The work on cloning and ESCs occurred alongside other advances, among which was the work of Hal Weintraub and colleagues, who in 1987 demonstrated that expression of a single transcription factor, MyoD, in fibroblasts could elicit a program of myogenesis and convert them into muscle cells (Davis et al., 1987Davis R.L. Weintraub H. Lassar A.B. Cell. 1987; 51: 987-1000Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2469) Google Scholar). Different cell types responded in this way to a greater or lesser extent, and MyoD was dubbed a “master regulator.” This demonstration established the important principle that transcription factors can force the conversion of one cell type into another. Preceding the work on MyoD was the demonstration by Peter Jones that treatment of 10T1/2 cells with a DNA demethylating agent called 5-azacytidine caused them to differentiate into adipogenic, myogenic, and chondrogenic cells. This experiment suggested the importance of epigenetic mechanisms in regulating cell fates, and was important for the identification of MyoD. The concept of transcription factor master regulators was also taking hold through the work of Walter Gehring, who showed in 1995 that the mammalian Pax6 gene, which specifies eye development, could also induce eye development in ectopic sites in Drosophila. The pioneering work of Henry Harris in 1969 also provided important background to cellular reprogramming. Harris showed that malignant cancer cells fused to fibroblasts were no longer malignant due to gene repression (Harris et al., 1969Harris H. Miller O.J. Klein G. Worst P. Tachibana T. Nature. 1969; 223: 363-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). Helen Blau’s work in 1983–84 along similar lines showed that fusion of cells with skeletal muscle cells activated muscle gene expression in nonmuscle cells, indicating the existence of transacting factors capable of inducing transdifferentiation. Takashi and Masako Tada in 1997 in my lab and thereafter independently in 2001 also showed that pluripotent stem cells fused with somatic cells could transform the latter into pluripotent stem cells. This experiment showed that ESCs contain trans-acting factors that can convert somatic cells into pluripotent stem cells without the need to transplant somatic nuclei into oocytes. Thus, the idea that ESCs must contain factors capable of converting somatic cells to pluripotent stem cells was starting to emerge. However, the low efficiency of restoring totipotency to somatic nuclei following transplantation into oocyte and the poor understanding of the underlying mechanism led to the notion that a large number of factors, perhaps even over 100, might be needed to convert somatic cells into pluripotent stem cells. The differentiated cell state is also highly stable and maintained by DNA methylation, an epigenetic modification that is difficult to erase. Nevertheless, Yamanaka took up this challenge, and in a relatively short time was able to report his groundbreaking achievement of inducing pluripotency by introducing a specific set of transcription factors (Takahashi and Yamanaka, 2006Takahashi K. Yamanaka S. Cell. 2006; 126: 663-676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18820) Google Scholar). Other than the sheer reliability of the approach, it was also astonishing that only four factors, Oct4, Sox2, Klf4, and c-Myc, were needed to induce pluripotency in somatic cells. Different factor combinations and even noncoding RNAs have since been reported to function in reprogramming of mouse and human somatic cells, but in most cases only a few factors are required to induce the transformation. This discovery, which has revolutionized the field of reprogramming and stem cells, has been adopted on a truly phenomenal and industrial scale within a short space of time. This pace of development is reflected by the awarding of the Nobel Prize only 6 years after the publication of the initial paper. Work on human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) does not suffer from the same ethical constraints as research on human ESCs, which is also often more time consuming and requires precious human preimplantation embryos. However, it will be important for overall progress to continue research on ESCs as well. The work on iPSCs has many implications, including those for germ cell biology, a subject that I personally have a strong interest in. Germ cells are sometimes called the “immortal” lineage because they generate the totipotent state in vivo and transmit genetic information to all generations. Anne McLaren considered germ cells to be the “most fascinating and deeply mysterious cells” of them all. With her enthusiastic support, we embarked on a quest to unravel the mysteries of mammalian germ cells at the Gurdon Institute 12 years ago with Petra Hajkova, Mitinori Saitou, and Katsuhiko Hayashi, among others. The recent work by Hayashi and Saitou on the derivation of sperm and oocytes from mouse ESCs and iPSCs has raised the possibility of breaking the “Weissman Barrier” by transferring genetic information from the soma to the germline through the conversion of somatic cells to gametes. The prospect of being able to generate the totipotent state from adult somatic cells in this way brings us close to the concept of immortality. There is little doubt that the ability to generate iPSCs from somatic cells has transformed the anticipated advances in regenerative medicine, in ways that have been articulated in numerous research and review articles. Just to take one example, the ability to generate iPSCs from patients with specific diseases or mutations has opened up prospects for studying how such disease states develop from the start, by following iPSCs as they recapitulate all the steps toward differentiation of affected tissues, and how they function at a cellular level through the analysis of differentiated cells. These in vitro models for human diseases can be used to screen for diagnostic and therapeutic agents, which by itself is an advance of great magnitude even if iPSCs do not ultimately fulfill all of their envisaged promises as vehicles for cell replacement therapy. The importance of work on iPSCs and nuclear transplantation for advances in fundamental knowledge should also not be underestimated. A deeper understanding of underlying mechanisms of reprogramming could, and can, be used for efficient and direct conversion of one cell type into another, and such transdifferentiation approaches bypass the need to return to the pluripotent state. Such an approach could even potentially be used to induce changes in cell states in vivo for recruitment of endogenous stem cells, and for dealing with disease states. Advances in this field might even make it possible to generate synthetic cells with desirable diverse properties that do not have direct in vivo counterparts. Biological research has undergone a dramatic transformation in recent years, with genome-scale approaches and advances in systems biology becoming particularly prominent. Rather than being a pursuit undertaken by small groups or even individuals, it is now a multidisciplinary, multigroup, and international enterprise, and many of the current approaches to funding are structured around supporting this type of endeavor. Looking back, however, it is evident that transformational advances can start with small steps by individuals that may seem of little consequence except to those who are driven simply by a desire to find out how it all works. In my view, it is crucial to provide support for individuals, some of whom may well be future Nobel laureates, who have an obsession to explore particular areas of research for their own sake. What we can safely predict is that the future is unpredictable, and that we can look forward to many more currently unknowable twists that underpin quantum leaps in science."

To elucidate the molecular mechanism of those dominant negative effects, we prepared Dictyostelium versions of D11N and D11Q mutant actins and characterized them in vitro. D11N and D11Q actins underwent salt-dependent reversible polymerization, although the resultant polymerization products contained small anomalous structures in addition to filaments of normal appearance. Both monomeric and polymeric D11Q actin released bound nucleotides more rapidly than the wild type, and intriguingly, both monomeric and polymeric D11Q actins hardly bound cofilin. The deficiency in cofilin binding can be explained by rapid exchange of bound nucleotide with ATP in solution, because cofilin does not bind ATP-bound actin. Copolymers of D11Q and wild type actins bound cofilin, but cofilin-induced depolymerization of the copolymers was slower than that of wild type filaments, which may presumably be the primary reason why this mutant actin is dominantly toxic in vivo.

Significance: Mechanism of a dominant negative actin mutation is elucidated. Actin plays a number of important roles in eukaryotic cells, including amoeboid movement, cytokinesis, adhesion, intracellular transport, endocytosis/exocytosis, as well as nuclear roles in transcription regulation. To perform these functions, actin filaments need to be polymerized and depolymerized in a spatially and temporally regulated manner. A number of actin-binding proteins, including those that affect polymerization and depolymerization, have been characterized in vitro, but the physiological functions of each of those actin regulatory proteins in vivo are not fully understood. Mutant proteins are generally useful tools to elucidate the molecular mechanism of protein functions, and dominant negative mutants often provide unique opportunities in those studies. Because actin is important in many cellular functions, a large number of actin mutations, some of which are dominant negative, have been identified from experimental genetic screens (1Wertman K.F.

Unfortunately, however, the expression of recombinant actin requires eukaryotic host cells (12Sternlicht H. Farr G.W. Sternlicht M.L. Driscoll J.K. Willison K. Yaffe M.B. The t-complex polypeptide 1 complex is a chaperonin for tubulin and actin in vivo.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1993; 90: 9422-9426Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar), and the expression of dominantly negative mutant actins would be toxic for the host cells, hampering their biochemical characterization (1Wertman K.F. Drubin D.G. Botstein D. Systematic mutational analysis of the yeast ACT1 gene.Genetics. 1992; 132: 337-350Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To resolve this problem, we developed a system to express toxic mutant actins in Dictyostelium, which takes advantage of thymosin β that was fused at the C terminus to mutant actin to inhibit copolymerization of the recombinant mutant actin with the endogenous actin of the host cells. The fusion protein was purified and treated with chymotrypsin, which efficiently cleaved the protein immediately after the native final residue of actin, to separate the actin and thymosin moieties (13Noguchi T.Q.

These studies demonstrated the usefulness of dominant negative mutant actins and prompted us to characterize other dominant negative actin mutants. Asp-11 in the budding yeast actin sequence is a part of the nucleotide-binding site (Fig. 1) and is conserved among all known actins. The D11Q mutant α-actin (D13Q in the α-actin and D12Q in Dictyostelium actin 15 sequences; the yeast amino acid residue number will be used throughout this paper) translated in vitro was found to be partially defective in binding to DNase I (15Solomon T.L. Solomon L.R. Gay L.S. Rubenstein P.A. Studies on the role of actin's aspartic acid 3 and aspartic acid 11 using oligodeoxynucleotide-directed site-specific mutagenesis.J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 19662-19669Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Subsequent overexpression of the corresponding mutant yeast actin in yeast cells demonstrated that it is a dominant lethal mutation (16Johannes F.J. Gallwitz D. Site-directed mutagenesis of the yeast actin gene. A test for actin function in vivo.EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3951-3958Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), although purification of the protein for detailed biochemical characterization was impossible due to the dominant lethality. More recently, the D11N mutation in human α-actin was identified to dominantly cause congenital myopathy (7Laing N.G. Dye D.E. Wallgren-Pettersson C. Richard G. Monnier N. Lillis S. Winder T.L. Lochmüller H. Graziano C. Mitrani-Rosenbaum S. Twomey D. Sparrow J.C. Beggs A.H. Nowak K.J. Mutations and polymorphisms of the skeletal muscle α-actin gene (ACTA1).Hum. Mutat. 2009; 30: 1267-1277Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar), further pointing to the need to characterize Asp-11-mutant actins in vitro. We thus constructed Dictyostelium versions of the D11N and D11Q mutant actins, purified them using our thymosin-fusion system, and characterized them in a variety of biochemical assays. Our results demonstrated that D11N/D11Q actin polymers are abnormal in a number of ways, including rapid release of bound nucleotides and defective cofilin binding and cofilin-mediated depolymerization, the former presumably causing the latter. Most notably, the copolymer of D11Q and WT actins also exhibited partial resistance to cofilin activity to accelerate depolymerization. Because cofilin is essential for yeast viability (17Iida K.

Supernatant and pellet fractions were subjected to SDS-PAGE, followed by staining with anti-GFP antibodies raised in rabbits. Recombinant WT and mutant actins were purified as described previously (14Noguchi T.Q. Gomibuchi Y. Murakami K. Ueno H. Hirose K. Wakabayashi T. Uyeda T.Q.

The concentration of actin was estimated using Advanced Protein Assay (Cytoskeleton, Denver, CO) using actin that was calibrated by absorption at 290 nm as the standard. cDNA of Dictyostelium cofilin (Ddcof1) (23Aizawa H.

These were used to express N-terminally His-tagged cofilin or cofilin-mCherry in Rosetta (DE3) Escherichia coli cells, which were purified using conventional methods. Monomeric WT or mutant actin was diluted in G-buffer (2 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 0.2 mm CaCl2, 0.1 mm ATP, 7 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.05% NaN3) and incubated on ice for 10 min. Polymerization was induced by the addition of concentrated F-buffer, and the increase in light scatter was monitored at 360 nm at 22 °C, using a 100-μl cuvette and a fluorescence spectrophotometer. The final concentration of each component was 5 μm actin, 2 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 100 mm KCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EGTA, 0.2 mm ATP, and 0.2 mm DTT. WT, mutant, or a 1:1 mixture of WT and mutant actins were allowed to polymerize in F-buffer at RT for 2 h. The concentration of total actin was 5 μm. Latrunculin A (Wako, Osaka, Japan) or DMSO control was added at a final concentration of 60 μm or 0.3%. Following a 10-min incubation, the mixtures were centrifuged at 250,000 × g for 10 min at 20 °C, and the supernatant and pellet fractions were subjected to SDS-PAGE. Alternatively, WT actin labeled at Cys-374 with pyrene (24Kouyama T. Mihashi K. Fluorimetry study of N-(1-pyrenyl)iodoacetamide-labeled F-actin.

Biochem. 1981; 114: 33-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar) was used, and the decrease in pyrene fluorescence was monitored using a fluorescence spectrophotometer with excitation and emission wavelengths of 365 and 407 nm, respectively. For direct observation of depolymerization of individual actin filaments, actin filaments (10 μm) were labeled with 200 μm Alexa-Fluor 488 succinimidyl ester (Invitrogen, Tokyo, Japan) in a buffer consisting of 2 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 50 mm KCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EGTA, and 0.2 mm ATP on ice overnight. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 0.1 m Tris-Cl, pH 7.4. After removing unbound dye by ion exchange resin (Dowex, 1 × 80, 100–200 mesh), the labeled actin was dialyzed against G-buffer. The resultant labeled monomeric actin was mixed with either unlabeled WT or D11Q actin in G-buffer at a 1:1 ratio, polymerized in F-buffer at RT for 2 h as above and, after dilution in assay buffer (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 25 mm KCl, 4 mm MgCl2, 10 mm DTT, and 0.5% bovine serum albumin), introduced into flow cells coated with 25 μg/ml skeletal heavy meromyosin, followed by incubation for 2 min. The flow cells were then perfused with a copious amount of F-buffer containing 10 mm DTT and the oxygen scavenger system, and actin filaments were observed with a fluorescence microscope (BX60, Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) equipped with an EB-CCD camera (C7190, Hamamatsu Photonics, Hamamatsu, Japan) at 25 °C. The time course of Pi release from polymerizing actin was measured by using an EnzChek phosphate assay kit (Invitrogen). Actin was polymerized at 10 μm, as described under “Polymerization Assay,” in the presence of 2-amino-6-mercapto-7-methylpurine riboside and 1 unit/ml purine nucleoside phosphorylase, and the absorbance at 360 nm was monitored. The rates of 1,N6-ethenoadenosine 5′-triphosphate (ϵ-ATP) 5The abbreviation used is: ϵ-ATP1,N6-ethenoadenosine 5′-triphosphate. release from monomeric actin was measured at 25 °C using a stopped flow system (SX18MV: Applied Photophysics, Leatherhead, UK). Actin filaments were dialyzed against G-buffer for 24 h, followed by second dialysis against G-buffer that contained 0.2 mm ϵ-ATP (Invitrogen) in place of ATP for 24 h (WT) or 48 h (mutants). This solution was rapidly mixed with an equal volume of G-buffer that contained 1 mm CaATP, and fluorescence excited by 360 nm light and passed through a 395-nm cutoff filter was monitored. 1,N6-ethenoadenosine 5′-triphosphate. WT, mutant, or a 1:1 mixture of WT and mutant actins were allowed to polymerize in 20 mm Pipes, pH 6.5, 50 mm KCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EGTA, 0.2 mm ATP, and 0.2 mm DTT at RT for 2 h. Cofilin was added at a final concentration of 2.5 μm, and 5 min later, the mixture was centrifuged at 250,000 × g at 20 °C for 10 min. The supernatant and pellet fractions were subjected to SDS-PAGE. For microscopic observation of cofilin binding to actin filaments, 1 μm Alexa-Fluor 488-labeled actin filaments were mixed with 2 μm cofilin-mCherry in buffer consisting of 10 mm Pipes, pH 6.5, 50 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 5 mm DTT, and 1 mm ATP. After incubation for 1 min at 25 °C, labeled actin filaments were diluted 10-fold in the same buffer and observed with a fluorescence microscope. Cofilin binding to monomeric actin was detected by cross-linking 7 μm actin and 14 μm cofilin in G-buffer with 40 mm 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide (Sigma) for 5 min at 25 °C. The reaction was stopped by the addition of SDS sample buffer, and the samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. WT, D11Q, and 1:1 mixtures of Alexa-Fluor 488-labeled WT actin and unlabeled WT or D11Q actin were polymerized in F-buffer at RT for 2 h or at 5 °C overnight. These were diluted to 5 μm in F-buffer that contained 2 mm Hepes, pH 7.4. Hepes, pH 8.35, and cofilin were added to the final concentrations of 10 mm and 10 μm, respectively, and 15 min later, the mixture was centrifuged at 250,000 × g for 10 min at 25 °C. The supernatant and pellet fractions were subjected to SDS-PAGE and stained with Coomassie Blue. The gel was also viewed on a Molecular Dynamics Typhoon 8600 Imager (GE Healthcare) with 532 nm excitation light. For microscopic observation of cofilin-induced severing/depolymerization of actin filaments, copolymers of Alexa-Fluor 488-labeled WT actin and either unlabeled WT or D11Q actin were diluted to 40 nm in Hepes buffer (10 mm Hepes, pH 8.35, 30 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm ATP, and 5 mm DTT), including 2 μm cofilin. After incubation for 5 min at 25 °C, the mixture was observed with a fluorescence microscope. G-actin (5 μm) was digested by 1 μg/ml subtilisin (Sigma) at 25 °C in modified G-buffer (2 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 0.2 mm CaCl2, 0.2 mm ATP, and 0.1 mm DTT). The reaction was stopped by 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and the samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. DNase I activity was measured at 22 °C by the change in A260 when DNA (50 μg/ml) (Sigma) was added to a mixture of 0.7 nm DNase I (Sigma) and 10 nm G-actin in G-buffer. WT or D11N/D11Q actin filaments in EM buffer (10 mm potassium phosphate buffer pH 7.4, 25 mm KCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm ATP, and 0.5 mm DTT) were placed on carbon-coated copper grids, stained with 1% uranyl acetate, and observed in an FEI Tecnai F20 electron microscope. D11N and D11Q mutant actins were expressed and purified as fusion proteins with thymosin β and a polyhistidine tag. After separating actin and thymosin-His tag moieties by chymotryptic digestion, we were able to further purify mutant actins by Q-Sepharose column chromatography, followed by a cycle of polymerization, pelleting by ultracentrifugation, and dialysis against G-buffer, in a manner similar to WT actin. When monomeric D11Q actin in G-buffer was induced to polymerize by the addition of salts, light scatter increased with a time course slower than the WT actin (Fig. 2A). Filaments were visualized by fluorescence microscopy following rhodamine-phalloidin staining of the D11Q polymers (Fig. 2B), suggesting that D11Q actin filaments were normal. Salt-induced polymerization of different batches of D11N actin yielded variable patterns of increase in light scattering (data not shown). However, as an example in Fig. 2A, they had a common tendency to steadily rise well above the steady state levels achieved by the same concentration of WT actin (arrow), suggestive of slow aggregate formation. When partially purified D11N actin from a Q-Sepharose column was allowed to polymerize and stained with rhodamine-phalloidin, a large number of normal filaments were visualized. However, when those filaments were dialyzed against G-buffer and ultracentrifuged and the supernatant fraction following ultracentrifugation was allowed to polymerize and stained with rhodamine-phalloidin, relatively few very short filaments, many of which appeared as dots, were observed (Fig. 2B). We next observed negatively stained D11N/D11Q actins under polymerization conditions by electron microscopy (Fig. 3). To our surprise, D11N/D11Q polymers contained small oligomeric structures without a noticeable double-helical appearance (Fig. 3, C and E), and numerous ring-like structures were observed in D11N polymers (Fig. 3, E and F). There were relatively few filaments of normal appearance, particularly in D11N polymers. The addition of phalloidin did not noticeably increase the filamentous fractions of D11Q polymers (Fig. 3D). These results and the fact that those mutant actins were purified normally by a cycle of polymerization and depolymerization together indicate that D11N/D11Q actins are able to undergo salt-dependent reversible polymerization, but the polymerized products contain normal filaments and abnormal oligomeric structures. Each D11N ring appeared to consist of five subunits (Fig. 3F). Similar rings had been observed with Ca2+-WT actin of fission yeast under polymerization conditions (25Takaine M. Mabuchi I. Properties of actin from the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe and interaction with fission yeast profilin.J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 21683-21694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), although the fission yeast actin rings were somewhat smaller than those of Asp-11-mutant actins. When a 1:1 mixture of D11Q actin labeled with Alexa-Fluor 594 and WT actin labeled with Alexa-Fluor 488 were allowed to polymerize and observed under a fluorescence microscope, the same filaments were visualized by both fluorophores (Fig. 4A). Interestingly, fluorescence intensities of both Alexa-Fluor 488 and Alexa-Fluor 594 were not homogeneous along the length of copolymers, suggesting the possibility that WT and D11Q actins tend to segregate from each other and form clusters. In addition, very bright fluorescent dots of Alexa-Fluor 594 were observed along the length (Fig. 4A, arrowheads). This may represent oligomeric structures of D11Q actin associated along the sides of filaments, as seen in electron micrographs (arrowheads in Fig. 3, C and D). When GFP-fused D11Q actin was expressed in Dictyostelium cells, the fluorescence was localized along cell edges, thin projections, and macropinocytotic cups (Fig. 4B). This is similar to the distribution of GFP-WT actin and is distinct from nonpolymerizable GFP-WT actin fused C-terminally with thymosin β (Fig. 4B). The cytoplasmic fluorescence of GFP-D11Q actin, which was derived from monomeric or oligomeric GFP-actin, was low and was comparable with that of GFP-WT actin, suggesting that both GFP-D11Q and GFP-WT actins copolymerized with endogenous actin with a similar efficiency in vivo. Western blotting analysis (Fig. 4C) showed that 53 ± 15% of GFP-WT actin was recovered in the Triton-insoluble fraction, whereas 30 ± 2.3% of GFP-D11Q actin was in the insoluble fraction (n = 3; the insoluble fraction of GFP-D11Q actin fused with thymosin β was 7.0 ± 0.8%)."
https://openalex.org/W1995234808,"Heat shock protein 47 (HSP47) is a single-substrate molecular chaperone crucial for collagen biosynthesis. Although its function is well established, the molecular mechanisms that govern binding to procollagen peptides and triple helices in the endoplasmic reticulum (followed by controlled release in the Golgi) are unclear. HSP47 binds procollagen at a neutral pH but releases at a pH similar to the pK(a) of the imidazole side chain of histidine residues. It thus seems likely that these residues are involved in this pH-dependent mechanism. Murine HSP47 has 14 histidine residues grouped into three clusters, known as the breach, gate, and shutter. Here, we report the use of histidine mutagenesis to demonstrate the relative contribution of these three clusters to HSP47 structure and the ""pH switch."" Many of the tested mutants are silent; however, breach mutants H197A and H198A show binding but no apparent pH switch and are unable to control release. Another breach mutant, H191A, shows perturbed collagen release characteristics, consistent with observed perturbations in pH-driven trans-conformational changes. Thus, His-198, His-197 and His-191 are important (if not central) to HSP47 mechanism of binding/release to collagen. This is consistent with the breach cluster residues being well conserved across the HSP47 family."
