Regulatory T (Treg) cells limit “collateral damage” resulting from protective immunity to infection and suppress sterile inflammation as well as unwanted immune responses to “self” and allergens (Belkaid and Tarbell, 2009Belkaid Y.

Suppressive function of Treg cells is indispensable for the immune homeostasis and survival of higher organisms; Treg cell ablation in healthy adult mice leads to a fatal, aggressive lympho- and myeloproliferative autoimmune syndrome (Kim et al., 2007Kim J.M.

X chromosome-encoded transcription factor Foxp3 plays a pivotal role in differentiation, homeostasis, and function of Treg cells. Foxp3 loss-of-function mutations cause systemic immune-mediated lesions similar to those observed upon chronic Treg cell ablation (Fontenot et al., 2003Fontenot J.D. Gavin M.A. Rudensky A.Y.

These studies also revealed that a number of genes constitutively up- or downregulated in Treg cells in a Foxp3-dependent manner undergo corresponding changes, albeit transient and less prominent, in activated effector T cells. This sizable cluster of “Foxp3-amplified” genes includes those serving as hallmarks of Treg cells (CTLA4, CD25, and GITR) and playing important functional roles in their homeostasis and function (Gavin et al., 2007Gavin M.A. Rasmussen J.P.

Foxp3 occupancy and regulation of key target genes during T-cell stimulation.Nature. 2007; 445: 931-935Crossref PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar). These results suggested that Foxp3 acts in an “opportunistic” manner by amplifying and stabilizing expression of genes beneficial to Treg cell function. In addition to coding genes, the “Foxp3-amplified” cluster also includes several small noncoding RNA known as microRNAs (miRNAs) (Cobb et al., 2006Cobb B.S. Hertweck A. Smith J. O'Connor E. Graf D. Cook T. Smale S.T. Sakaguchi S. Livesey F.J. Fisher A.G. et al.A role for Dicer in immune regulation.J. Exp. Med. 2006; 203: 2519-2527Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar). Notably, miRNAs serve as important regulators of Treg cell homeostasis and function in both basal and inflammatory settings (Chong et al., 2008Chong M.M. Rasmussen J.P. Rudensky A.Y. Littman D.R. The RNAseIII enzyme Drosha is critical in T cells for preventing lethal inflammatory disease.J. Exp. Med. 2008; 205: 2005-2017Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar, Liston et al., 2008Liston A.

Selective miRNA disruption in T reg cells leads to uncontrolled autoimmunity.J. Exp. Med. 2008; 205: 1983-1991Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). Ablation of miRNA precursor-processing enzyme Dicer in Treg cells results in a reduction in their numbers and suppressive capacity in healthy mice harboring both Dicer-deficient and -sufficient Treg cells and a complete loss of suppressor function in diseased mice lacking wild-type Treg cells (Liston et al., 2008Liston A. Lu L.F. O'Carroll D. Tarakhovsky A. Rudensky A.Y. Dicer-dependent microRNA pathway safeguards regulatory T cell function.J. Exp. Med. 2008; 205: 1993-2004Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). Consequently, the generalized depletion of miRNAs in Treg cells leads to a fatal early-onset autoimmune pathology indistinguishable from that in Foxp3 mutant mice devoid of Treg cells (Chong et al., 2008Chong M.M. Rasmussen J.P. Rudensky A.Y. Littman D.R. The RNAseIII enzyme Drosha is critical in T cells for preventing lethal inflammatory disease.J. Exp.

Med. 2008; 205: 1983-1991Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). These results and the description of a subset of miRNAs differentially expressed in regulatory versus effector T cells (Cobb et al., 2006Cobb B.S. Hertweck A. Smith J. O'Connor E. Graf D. Cook T. Smale S.T. Sakaguchi S. Livesey F.J. Fisher A.G. et al.A role for Dicer in immune regulation.J. Exp. Med. 2006; 203: 2519-2527Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar) raised a question as to how individual miRNAs present in increased amounts in Treg cells contribute to distinct aspects of their homeostasis and function. In this regard, miR-155, a well-known onco-miR (cancer-associated micro-RNA), is constitutively expressed in high amounts in Treg cells in a Foxp3-dependent manner, whereas T cells lacking Foxp3, B cells, and myeloid cells transiently upregulate miR-155 upon activation (Androulidaki et al., 2009Androulidaki A.

Kutok J.L. et al.Regulation of the germinal center response by microRNA-155.Science. 2007; 316: 604-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (1189) Google Scholar). Our previous studies showed that miR-155 confers heightened responsiveness of Treg cells to their key survival and growth factor, IL-2, thereby maintaining their numbers in a competitive environment. However, miR-155 is largely dispensable for Treg suppressor function (Lu et al., 2009Lu L.F. Thai T.H. Calado D.P. Chaudhry A. Kubo M. Tanaka K. Loeb G.B. Lee H. Yoshimura A.

Like miR-155, miR-146a is highly expressed in Treg cells and is induced upon activation of effector T cells and myeloid cells. In the latter, miR-146a acts as a negative feedback regulator to limit TRAF6 and IRAK1/2-mediated signaling in inflammatory settings (Hou et al., 2009Hou J. Wang P. Lin L. Liu X. Ma F. An H. Wang Z. Cao X. MicroRNA-146a feedback inhibits RIG-I-dependent Type I IFN production in macrophages by targeting TRAF6, IRAK1, and IRAK2.J. Immunol. 2009; 183: 2150-2158Crossref PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar, Taganov et al., 2006Taganov K.D. Boldin M.P. Chang K.J. Baltimore D. NF-kappaB-dependent induction of microRNA miR-146, an inhibitor targeted to signaling proteins of innate immune responses.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2006; 103: 12481-12486Crossref PubMed Scopus (3209) Google Scholar), whereas in activated human T cells, miR-146a has been suggested to oppose apoptosis and IL-2 production (Curtale et al., 2010Curtale G. Citarella F. Carissimi C. Goldoni M. Carucci N. Fulci V. Franceschini D. Meloni F. Barnaba V. Macino G. An emerging player in the adaptive immune response: microRNA-146a is a modulator of IL-2 expression and activation-induced cell death in T lymphocytes.Blood. 2010; 115: 265-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Thus, we explored a role for miR-146a in Treg cells and found that this microRNA is essential for the ability of Treg cells to restrain IFNγ-mediated pathogenic Th1 responses and associated inflammation. In Treg cells, miR-146a-mediated downregulation of Stat1, a key transcription factor required for Th1 effector cell differentiation, was necessary for Treg ability to suppress Th1 responses. Furthermore, relieving negative regulation of Stat1 activation in Treg cells using an alternative genetic approach resulted in a breakdown of immune homeostasis similar to that observed in mice harboring miR-146a-deficient Treg cells. Thus, our results suggest that a specific miRNA overrepresented in Treg cells ensures their suppressor function by maintaining an optimal threshold of cytokine receptor-dependent activation of transcription factors crucial for a particular type of immune response. To identify miRNAs essential for controlling Treg cell function, we considered miRNAs differentially expressed between Foxp3+ Treg cells and Foxp3- non-Treg CD4+ T cells (Cobb et al., 2006Cobb B.S. Hertweck A. Smith J. O'Connor E. Graf D. Cook T. Smale S.T. Sakaguchi S. Livesey F.J. Fisher A.G. et al.A role for Dicer in immune regulation.J. Exp. Med. 2006; 203: 2519-2527Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar; data not shown). Among miRNA overrepresented in Treg cells, miR-146 was particularly prominent. This miRNA has been implicated in negative regulation of immune cell function, specifically in negative feedback regulation of myeloid cell activation (Taganov et al., 2006Taganov K.D. Boldin M.P. Chang K.J. Baltimore D. NF-kappaB-dependent induction of microRNA miR-146, an inhibitor targeted to signaling proteins of innate immune responses.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2006; 103: 12481-12486Crossref PubMed Scopus (3209) Google Scholar). To study the role of miR-146 in Treg cells, we first sought to confirm the high amounts of miR-146 in Treg cells. Since mature miR-146a and miR-146b sequences differ by two nucleotides, it was difficult to distinguish whether miR-146a or miR-146b or both are present in increased amounts in Treg cells. To address this issue, we performed stem-loop based Taqman real-time RT-PCR assay, which allowed us to distinguish miRNAs within the same family (Chen et al., 2005Chen C. Ridzon D.A. Broomer A.J. Zhou Z. Lee D.H. Nguyen J.T. Barbisin M. Xu N.L. Mahuvakar V.R. Andersen M.R. et al.Real-time quantification of microRNAs by stem-loop RT-PCR.Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: e179Crossref PubMed Scopus (3737) Google Scholar). As shown in Figure S1A (available online), the miR-146a expression in CD4+CD25+Treg cells was sharply augmented in comparison to that in CD4+CD25-CD62Lhi-naive T cells, while miR-146b expression was much lower. Analysis of Treg and non-Treg cell subsets isolated from miR-146a-deficient mice suggested that the small increase in miR-146b signal in Treg cells was likely due to miR-146a expression since miR-146b expression could no longer be observed in miR-146a-deficient Treg cells (Figure S1A). In support of this notion, examination of primary miRNA transcripts demonstrated that pri-miR-146a but not pri-miR-146b was elevated in Treg cells compared with naive T cells (Figure S1B). Thus, miR-146a, but not miR-146b, was highly upregulated in Treg cells. To assess a role for miR-146a in Treg cells, we examined Foxp3+ Treg cell subsets in the thymus and in the peripheral lymphoid organs of miR-146a-deficient mice. These mice develop severe lympho- and myeloproliferative syndrome at 6 months of age (M.P.B., K.D.T. and D.B., unpublished data). Therefore, we analyzed miR-146a-deficient and littermate control mice at 6–8 weeks of age prior to development of any clinical signs of autoimmune or inflammatory disease and found comparable sizes of different thymocyte and peripheral lymphoid and myeloid cell subsets (Figures S1C–S1F; data not shown). Moreover, T cell activation status was also similar to that observed in the wild-type (WT) littermates (Figure S1I; data not shown). In contrast to a reduction in Treg cell numbers observed in mice lacking miR-155 (Lu et al., 2009Lu L.F. Thai T.H. Calado D.P. Chaudhry A. Kubo M. Tanaka K. Loeb G.B. Lee H. Yoshimura A. Rajewsky K. et al.Foxp3-dependent microRNA155 confers competitive fitness to regulatory T cells by targeting SOCS1 protein.Immunity. 2009; 30: 80-91Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar), miR-146a-deficient mice contained significantly increased numbers of Foxp3+ Treg cells in the periphery, but not in the thymus (Figures S1G and S1H). Consistent with its increased size, the miR-146a-deficient Treg cell subset exhibited heightened proliferative activity reflected in augmented expression of Ki67 and a modest increase in several activation markers (Figure S1J; data not shown). As miR-146a is an important negative regulator of myeloid cell responses to cytokines and Toll-like receptor (TLR) ligands, it was possible that increased miR-146a-deficient Treg cell numbers were due to a heightened activation status of dendritic cell (DC), but not a cell-intrinsic effect of miR-146a deficiency. It was also possible that altered immune effector function in Mirn146a−/− mice masked potential defects in miR-146a-deficient Treg cell-mediated suppression. To explore these possibilities we performed a series of bone marrow (BM) transfer studies (Figure 1A ). First, we transferred BM cells from miR-146a-deficient or -sufficient littermates mixed with BM cells from Ly5.1+B6 mice at a 1:1 ratio into Rag2- or TCRβδ-deficient recipients. Analysis of the resulting chimeric animals (Mirn146a−/−/B6) allowed us to discriminate between cell-intrinsic and cell-extrinsic effects of miR-146a deficiency on increased Treg cell numbers. Second, by performing cotransfers of Ly5.1+Foxp3KO BM cells in place of Ly5.1+B6 BM, we generated mice (Mirn146a−/−/Foxp3KO) in which all Treg cells lack miR-146a because Foxp3KO precursors fail to generate Treg cells, but all other BM-derived cells originate from both miR-146a-deficient and -sufficient BM. These mice allowed us to examine the function of miR-146a-deficient Treg cells in a miR-146a-sufficient environment. Like chimeric mice reconstituted with Foxp3KO BM alone, Mirn-146a−/−/Foxp3KO chimeras developed severe immune-mediated pathology including conjunctivitis, blepharitis, and dermatitis as early as 5 weeks after BM transfer and became moribund soon thereafter (Figure 1B). Histological examination of Mirn146a−/−/Foxp3KO chimeras 6–7 weeks after transfer showed massive lymphocyte activation and tissue infiltration in the lung, liver, and skin similar to that observed in mice harboring Dicer-deficient Treg cells (Chong et al., 2008Chong M.M.

In contrast, there were no clinical or histological signs of immune-mediated lesions in control Mirn146a−/−/B6 chimeras where both miR-146a-deficient and -sufficient Treg cells were present (Figure S2).Figure S2Extensive Mononuclear Cell Infiltration in Multiple Organs of Mice Harboring miR-146a-Deficient Treg Cells, Related to Figure 1Show full captionH&E-stained sections of the skin, liver, and lung from Mirn146a−/−/Foxp3KO and Mirn146a−/−/B6 chimeric mice generated upon transfer of Mirn146a−/− BM mixed with Ly5.1+ Foxp3KO BM or Ly5.1+ B6 BM 6-7 weeks after BM transfer.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) H&E-stained sections of the skin, liver, and lung from Mirn146a−/−/Foxp3KO and Mirn146a−/−/B6 chimeric mice generated upon transfer of Mirn146a−/− BM mixed with Ly5.1+ Foxp3KO BM or Ly5.1+ B6 BM 6-7 weeks after BM transfer. The disease in Mirn146a−/−/Foxp3KO was not due to reduced numbers of Treg cells. Mirn146a−/−/Foxp3KO chimeras, which developed autoimmune pathology, had increased numbers of Treg cells compared with control Mirn146a+/+/Foxp3KO animals (Figures 1C–1E). Importantly, the difference in miR-146-deficient versus -sufficient Treg cell numbers was also observed in Mirn146a−/−/B6 chimeric mice where miR-146a-deficient Treg cells compete with their wild-type counterparts (Figures 1F and 1G). The observed increase in the proportion of the miR-146a-deficient Treg cell subset in both Mirn146a−/−/Foxp3KO and Mirn146a−/−/Ly5.1+B6 mixed chimeras suggested that miR-146a deficiency increases Treg cell numbers in a cell-autonomous manner. Despite their increased numbers, miR-146a-deficient Treg cells were unable to restrain activation of miR-146a-sufficient effector T cells, which was exhibited by high proliferative activity, an increased CD62Llow cell subset, and high levels of the activation markers ICOS and CTLA4 (Figure 1H). In agreement with the histolopathology data and lack of clinical signs of disease, flow cytometric analysis of control Mirn-146a−/−/Ly5.1+B6 chimeras showed that both miR-146a-sufficient and -deficient effector T cells were kept in check by the miR-146a-sufficient Treg cells present in these mice (Figure 1I). These results suggested an indispensable role of miR-146a in Treg cell-mediated immunological tolerance. To identify the underlying mechanisms responsible for early fatal immune-mediated disease observed in Mirn146a−/−/Foxp3KO chimeras, we first sought to examine whether miR-146a deficiency results in a general impairment of Treg suppression function in inflammatory settings similar to Dicer deficiency in Treg cells (Liston et al., 2008Liston A. Lu L.F. O'Carroll D. Tarakhovsky A. Rudensky A.Y. Dicer-dependent microRNA pathway safeguards regulatory T cell function.J. Exp. Med. 2008; 205: 1993-2004Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). To examine this possibility, miR-146a-deficient Treg cells isolated from healthy Mirn146a−/−/B6 or diseased Mirn146a−/−/Foxp3KO mice were cocultured with miR-146a-sufficient responder CD4+ T cells. We found that miR-146a-deficient Treg cells isolated from healthy Mirn146a−/−/B6 chimeras were as suppressive as their miR-146-sufficient counterparts from control animals, whereas miR-146-deficient Treg cells from diseased Mirn146a−/−/Foxp3KO mice were more suppressive in vitro, likely due to their activation in an inflammatory environment (Figures 2A and 2B ). These results suggested that, unlike Dicer deficiency, lack of miR-146a did not diminish the overall suppressor capacity of Treg cells reflected by an in vitro suppression assay. Instead, a particular aspect of Treg suppressor function was likely impaired in the absence of miR-146a. As mentioned earlier, miR-146a functions as a negative regulator of TLR/IL-1 signaling pathway by targeting TRAF6 and IRAK1/2 (Taganov et al., 2006Taganov K.D. Boldin M.P. Chang K.J. Baltimore D.

Moreover, a critical role of IRAK1 in promoting Th17 differentiation at the expense of TGFβ-dependent generation of peripheral Foxp3+ Treg cells suggested a possibility that the lack of miR-146a might lead to heightened Th17 responses, which cause the fatal autoimmunity in Mirn146a−/−/Foxp3KO chimeras (Maitra et al., 2009Maitra U. Davis S. Reilly C.M. Li L. Differential regulation of Foxp3 and IL-17 expression in CD4 T helper cells by IRAK-1.J. Immunol. 2009; 182: 5763-5769Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Indeed, in agreement with previous studies we found increased levels of TRAF6 and IRAK1 in Treg and non-Treg T cells (Figure S1K). However, we did not observe any change in either Foxp3 induction or Th17 differentiation in vitro in the presence or absence of miR-146a (Figure S1L). More importantly, Th17 cell numbers were similar in Mirn146a−/−/Foxp3KO and control Mirn146a+/+/Foxp3KO and Mirn146a−/−/B6 mice (data not shown). Further analysis of cytokine production showed that the loss of miR-146a in Treg cells resulted in increased production of the proinflammatory Th1 cytokine IFNγ by both miR-146a-deficient and -sufficient CD4 and CD8 T cells, whereas production of IL-4, IL-5, and IL-17 was unaffected (Figure 2C; data not shown). This increase was not observed in the presence of miR-146a-sufficient Treg cells in Mirn146a−/−/B6 mice (Figure 2F; data not shown). The selective dysregulation of Th1 responses in the presence of miR-146a-deficient Treg cells was in contrast to sharply increased production of multiple cytokines (IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-17, and IFNγ) in the presence of Dicer-deficient Treg cells (Liston et al., 2008Liston A. Lu L.F. O'Carroll D. Tarakhovsky A. Rudensky A.Y. Dicer-dependent microRNA pathway safeguards regulatory T cell function.J. Exp. Med. 2008; 205: 1993-2004Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). Consistent with these findings, purified miR-146a-deficient Treg cells adoptively transferred together with Foxp3KO CD4+ effector T cells into lymphopenic recipients failed to restrain Th1 responses (Figure S3). In addition to a marked increase in IFNγ production in miR-146a-sufficient and -deficient effector T cells, a sizable proportion of miR-146a-deficient Foxp3+ Treg cells produced IFNγ in Mirn146a−/−/Foxp3KO mice (Figures 2C–2E). Production of IFNγ and other effector cytokines by Treg cells is kept in check by Foxp3 likely as a “safety” feature, since Treg cells express TCR with an increased reactivity against “self” antigens (Hsieh et al., 2006Hsieh C.S.

Here, we determine proteins that bind these marks by high-accuracy, quantitative mass spectrometry. These chromatin “readers” are assigned to complexes by interaction proteomics of full-length BAC-GFP-tagged proteins. ChIP-Seq profiling identifies their genomic binding sites, revealing functional properties. Among the main findings, the human SAGA complex binds to H3K4me3 via a double Tudor-domain in the C terminus of Sgf29, and the PWWP domain is identified as a putative H3K36me3 binding motif. The ORC complex, including LRWD1, binds to the three most prominent transcriptional repressive lysine methylation sites. Our data reveal a highly adapted interplay between chromatin marks and their associated protein complexes. Reading specific trimethyl-lysine sites by specialized complexes appears to be a widespread mechanism to mediate gene expression."

This kind of task makes it possible to obtain both an objective measure of how accurate subjects are and a subjective measure of how confident they are in their judgments. Fleming et al. (p. 1541 ; see the Perspective by Lau and Maniscalco ) have taken this approach one step further by constructing a measure of how accurate subjects are in their confidence judgments. This capacity for introspection, which can be regarded as one facet of metacognition (thinking about thinking), is shown to vary across individuals and to correlate positively with the gray matter volume of the frontopolar cortex (the frontmost region of the brain) and also with white matter in the tracts of the corpus callosum that connect these regions in the left and right hemispheres."
https://openalex.org/W2131966229,"It has been roughly three decades since laser cooling techniques produced ultracold atoms, leading to rapid advances in a vast array of fields. Unfortunately laser cooling has not yet been extended to molecules because of their complex internal structure. However, this complexity makes molecules potentially useful for many applications. For example, heteronuclear molecules possess permanent electric dipole moments which lead to long-range, tunable, anisotropic dipole-dipole interactions. The combination of the dipole-dipole interaction and the precise control over molecular degrees of freedom possible at ultracold temperatures make ultracold molecules attractive candidates for use in quantum simulation of condensed matter systems and quantum computation. Also ultracold molecules may provide unique opportunities for studying chemical dynamics and for tests of fundamental symmetries. Here we experimentally demonstrate laser cooling of the molecule strontium monofluoride (SrF). Using an optical cycling scheme requiring only three lasers, we have observed both Sisyphus and Doppler cooling forces which have substantially reduced the transverse temperature of a SrF molecular beam. Currently the only technique for producing ultracold molecules is by binding together ultracold alkali atoms through Feshbach resonance or photoassociation. By contrast, different proposed applications for ultracold molecules require a variety of molecular energy-level structures. Our method provides a new route to ultracold temperatures for molecules. In particular it bridges the gap between ultracold temperatures and the ~1 K temperatures attainable with directly cooled molecules (e.g. cryogenic buffer gas cooling or decelerated supersonic beams). Ultimately our technique should enable the production of large samples of molecules at ultracold temperatures for species that are chemically distinct from bialkalis."
https://openalex.org/W1966782228,"The body typically responds to its environment in a rhythmic, or circadian, fashion, including endogenous hepatic glucose production (HGP)—a key response to fasting. Steve Kay and his colleagues have now found that important mediators of the circadian clock in the liver also regulate HGP and that their genetic overexpression improve glucose metabolism and insulin sensitivity in a mouse model of type 2 diabetes. During fasting, mammals maintain normal glucose homeostasis by stimulating hepatic gluconeogenesis1. Elevations in circulating glucagon and epinephrine, two hormones that activate hepatic gluconeogenesis, trigger the cAMP-mediated phosphorylation of cAMP response element–binding protein (Creb) and dephosphorylation of the Creb-regulated transcription coactivator-2 (Crtc2)—two key transcriptional regulators of this process2. Although the underlying mechanism is unclear, hepatic gluconeogenesis is also regulated by the circadian clock, which coordinates glucose metabolism with changes in the external environment3,4,5,6. Circadian control of gene expression is achieved by two transcriptional activators, Clock and Bmal1, which stimulate cryptochrome (Cry1 and Cry2) and Period (Per1, Per2 and Per3) repressors that feed back on Clock-Bmal1 activity. Here we show that Creb activity during fasting is modulated by Cry1 and Cry2, which are rhythmically expressed in the liver. Cry1 expression was elevated during the night-day transition, when it reduced fasting gluconeogenic gene expression by blocking glucagon-mediated increases in intracellular cAMP concentrations and in the protein kinase A–mediated phosphorylation of Creb. In biochemical reconstitution studies, we found that Cry1 inhibited accumulation of cAMP in response to G protein–coupled receptor (GPCR) activation but not to forskolin, a direct activator of adenyl cyclase. Cry proteins seemed to modulate GPCR activity directly through interaction with Gsα. As hepatic overexpression of Cry1 lowered blood glucose concentrations and improved insulin sensitivity in insulin-resistant db/db mice, our results suggest that compounds that enhance cryptochrome activity may provide therapeutic benefit to individuals with type 2 diabetes."
https://openalex.org/W2037115572,"Many viruses utilize host ESCRT proteins for budding; however, influenza virus budding is thought to be ESCRT-independent. In this study we have found a role for the influenza virus M2 proton-selective ion channel protein in mediating virus budding. We observed that a highly conserved amphipathic helix located within the M2 cytoplasmic tail mediates a cholesterol-dependent alteration in membrane curvature. The 17 amino acid amphipathic helix is sufficient for budding into giant unilamellar vesicles, and mutation of this sequence inhibited budding of transfected M2 protein in vivo. We show that M2 localizes to the neck of budding virions and that mutation of the M2 amphipathic helix results in failure of the virus to undergo membrane scission and virion release. These data suggest that M2 mediates the final steps of budding for influenza viruses, bypassing the need for host ESCRT proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2060033529,"The serotonin transporter (SERT) ensures the recapture of serotonin and is the pharmacological target of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) antidepressants. We show that SERT is a target of microRNA-16 (miR-16). miR-16 is expressed at higher levels in noradrenergic than in serotonergic cells; its reduction in noradrenergic neurons causes de novo SERT expression. In mice, chronic treatment with the SSRI fluoxetine (Prozac) increases miR-16 levels in serotonergic raphe nuclei, which reduces SERT expression. Further, raphe exposed to fluoxetine release the neurotrophic factor S100β, which acts on noradrenergic cells of the locus coeruleus. By decreasing miR-16, S100β turns on the expression of serotonergic functions in noradrenergic neurons. Based on pharmacological and behavioral data, we propose that miR-16 contributes to the therapeutic action of SSRI antidepressants in monoaminergic neurons."

https://openalex.org/W1976779549,"In response to many apoptotic stimuli, oligomerization of Bax is essential for mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization and the ensuing release of cytochrome c. These events are accompanied by mitochondrial fission that appears to require Drp1, a large GTPase of the dynamin superfamily. Loss of Drp1 leads to decreased cytochrome c release by a mechanism that is poorly understood. Here we show that Drp1 stimulates tBid-induced Bax oligomerization and cytochrome c release by promoting tethering and hemifusion of membranes in vitro. This function of Drp1 is independent of its GTPase activity and relies on arginine 247 and the presence of cardiolipin in membranes. In cells, overexpression of Drp1 R247A/E delays Bax oligomerization and cell death. Our findings uncover a function of Drp1 and provide insight into the mechanism of Bax oligomerization."

The mechanisms that allow cancer cells to tolerate the adverse effects of aneuploidy are not known. To probe this question, we identified aneuploid yeast strains with improved proliferative abilities. Their molecular characterization revealed strain-specific genetic alterations as well as mutations shared between different aneuploid strains. Among the latter, a loss-of-function mutation in the gene encoding the deubiquitinating enzyme Ubp6 improves growth rates in four different aneuploid yeast strains by attenuating the changes in intracellular protein composition caused by aneuploidy. Our results demonstrate the existence of aneuploidy-tolerating mutations that improve the fitness of multiple different aneuploidies and highlight the importance of ubiquitin-proteasomal degradation in suppressing the adverse effects of aneuploidy."
https://openalex.org/W1997977259,"Location Matters Plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs), an immune cell specialized to respond to viral infections, use Toll-like receptors (TLRs) 7 and 9 expressed in endosomes to sense viral nucleic acids. Triggering of TLR7 or 9 results in the induction of two distinct signaling pathways, one that leads to the production of proinflammatory cytokines and another that induces the expression of antiviral type I interferons. How one receptor can trigger two distinct signaling pathways, however, is not clear. Sasai et al. (p. 1530 ) now show that subcellular localization is key. Cells from mice deficient in the Adapter Protein 3 (AP-3) complex, which regulates protein sorting to intracellular vesicles, did not produce type I interferons in response to TLR9 ligand, but proinflammatory cytokine production remained intact. AP-3 was required for trafficking of TLR9 from early endosomes, where proinflammatory signaling can occur, to lysosome-related organelles, where the signaling machinery required for type I interferon induction is located. Such spatial segregation may represent a common mechanism whereby activation of one receptor can result in the induction of multiple independent signaling cascades."
https://openalex.org/W2143684129,"The authors have developed a new inhibitor of the enzyme that degrades the endocannabinoid anandamide. This new drug does not cross the blood-brain barrier. It elevates peripheral anandamide only, which, acting on peripheral CB1 receptors, attenuates pain responses in rodents. Peripheral cannabinoid receptors exert a powerful inhibitory control over pain initiation, but the endocannabinoid signal that normally engages this intrinsic analgesic mechanism is unknown. To address this question, we developed a peripherally restricted inhibitor (URB937) of fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH), the enzyme responsible for the degradation of the endocannabinoid anandamide. URB937 suppressed FAAH activity and increased anandamide levels outside the rodent CNS. Despite its inability to access brain and spinal cord, URB937 attenuated behavioral responses indicative of persistent pain in rodent models of peripheral nerve injury and inflammation and prevented noxious stimulus–evoked neuronal activation in spinal cord regions implicated in nociceptive processing. CB1 cannabinoid receptor blockade prevented these effects. These results suggest that anandamide-mediated signaling at peripheral CB1 receptors controls the access of pain-related inputs to the CNS. Brain-impenetrant FAAH inhibitors, which strengthen this gating mechanism, might offer a new approach to pain therapy."

This occurs because of potential deleterious epistatic interactions in hybrids involving two or more interacting genes. Testing QTLs (quantitative trait loci) in seed and pollen sterility between multiple species pairs in the plant group Solanum , Moyle and Nakazato (p. 1521 ) show that hybrid female (seed) sterility accumulates exponentially between increasingly distant species pairs, although not for hybrid male (pollen) sterility. In contrast, loci contributing to differences in other traits show no evidence for nonlinear accumulation over time. Matute et al. (p. 1518 ) come to similar conclusions through the use of deletion mapping in comparisons between two pairs of species of Drosophila . The number of genes causing postzygotic isolation grows as fast as the square of the number of substitutions between two species. Thus, a hybrid snowball effect is found in both plants and animals."
https://openalex.org/W2152950305,"AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is a metabolic sensor involved in intracellular energy metabolism through the control of several homeostatic mechanisms, which include autophagy and protein degradation. Recently, we reported that AMPK activation by resveratrol promotes autophagy-dependent degradation of the amyloid-β (Aβ) peptides, the core components of the cerebral senile plaques in Alzheimer's disease. To identify more potent enhancers of Aβ degradation, we screened a library of synthetic small molecules selected for their structural similarities with resveratrol. Here, we report the identification of a series of structurally related molecules, the RSVA series, which inhibited Aβ accumulation in cell lines nearly 40 times more potently than did resveratrol. Two of these molecules, RSVA314 and RSVA405, were further characterized and were found to facilitate CaMKKβ-dependent activation of AMPK, to inhibit mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin), and to promote autophagy to increase Aβ degradation by the lysosomal system (apparent EC50 ~1 µM).

U.S.A. 2003; 100: 14006-14011Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The cells stably expressing the pLKO.1 vector were used as a control. Overnight cultured BL21 cells harboring the pGEX-S6K1-(332–421) plasmid (a generous gift of Dr. Jie Chen, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign) were diluted 1:10 with fresh LB medium containing 50 μm ampicillin and cultured at 37 °C for 80 min. Cells were then cultured at 30 °C, and the production of the GST-S6K1-(332–421) fusion protein was induced by the addition of 1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. Cells were cultured for 2.5 h, harvested, and lysed with lysis buffer containing 20 mg lysozyme. The GST-S6K1-(332–421) fusion protein was affinity-purified on glutathione-agarose. The mTOR in vitro activity assays were performed according to the procedure described previously (19Peterson T.R. Laplante M. Thoreen C.C. Sancak Y. Kang S.A. Kuehl W.M. Gray N.S. Sabatini D.M.

In brief, C2C12 cells grown on a 100-mm plate were lysed with 500 μl of ice-cold lysis buffer (40 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 2 mm EDTA, 10 mm pyrophosphate, 10 mm glycerophosphate, 0.3% CHAPS, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, and phosphatase inhibitor mixtures). Cell lysates were clarified by centrifugation, and cell lysates were incubated with 2 μl of anti-mTOR antibody overnight at 4 °C. This was followed by the addition of 30 μl of protein A beads and incubation with rotation for an additional 2 h. The beads were washed three times with low salt buffer (40 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 10 mm pyrophosphate, 10 mm glycerophosphate, and 0.3% CHAPS) and then twice with buffer containing 25 mm HEPES (pH 7.4) and 20 mm KCl. The mTOR activity assays were initiated by the addition of 30 μl of kinase assay buffer containing 25 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 20 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 50 mm ATP, 1 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, and 500 ng of GST-S6K1-(332–421) fusion protein. The reaction was continued for 20 min at 37 °C, stopped by the addition of SDS loading buffer, and boiled at 95 °C for 5 min. The phosphorylation of GST-S6K1 was determined by autoradiography. Quantification of S6K phosphorylation and S6K protein levels was performed by analyzing Western blots using NIH Scion Image software. The ratio of S6K phosphorylation to the protein level of this kinase was used for statistical analysis in each experiment. Results are expressed as the mean ± S.E. Differences between groups were examined for statistical significance using analysis of variance (ANOVA). To determine the potential effect of RSV on mTOR activity, C2C12 myoblasts were treated with insulin or leucine in the presence or absence of RSV. Insulin and leucine treatments dramatically stimulated S6K and 4E-BP1 phosphorylation at Thr389 and Thr37/46, respectively (Fig. 1, A and B). The stimulatory effect of insulin and leucine on S6K or 4E-BP1 phosphorylation was significantly reduced by cotreating the cells with RSV in a dose-dependent (Fig. 1, A and B) and time-dependent (supplemental Fig. S1, A and B) manner. Treating the cells with RSV had little effect on the protein levels of Raptor, Rictor, or Sirt1 (supplemental Fig. S1C), suggesting that the reduced TORC1 signaling is not due to reduced expression levels of these mTOR components. To elucidate the mechanism by which RSV inhibits mTOR signaling, we examined the potential involvement of Sirt1, which has been suggested to be a key mediator of RSV function (21Kaeberlein M. McDonagh T. Heltweg B. Hixon J. Westman E.A. Caldwell S.D. Napper A. Curtis R. DiStefano P.S. Fields S. Bedalov A. Kennedy B.K. J. Biol.

Chem. 2005; 280: 17187-17195Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (890) Google Scholar). Interestingly, overexpression of Sirt1 had no significant effect on RSV-induced suppression of insulin- or leucine-stimulated S6K phosphorylation in C2C12 myoblasts (Fig. 1, C and D). In addition, RSV greatly suppressed insulin- and leucine-stimulated S6K and 4E-BP1 phosphorylation in both wild-type and Sirt1−/− MEFs (Fig. 1, E and F). Consistent with the view that Sirt1 is dispensable for the inhibitory effect of RSV, inhibition of Sirt1 by sirtinol had no significant effect on the inhibitory role of RSV in insulin-stimulated S6K and 4E-BP1 phosphorylation in C2C12 myoblasts (supplemental Fig. S1D). Activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway is essential for insulin-stimulated mTOR activation. To determine whether inhibition of the PI3K/Akt pathway provides a mechanism by which RSV suppresses insulin-stimulated mTOR activation, we cotreated C2C12 myoblasts with insulin and RSV. Treating the cells with RSV did not inhibit insulin-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of the insulin receptor (Fig. 2A), nor did it affect insulin-stimulated ERK1/2 phosphorylation (Fig. 2B). On the other hand, RSV treatment reduced insulin-stimulated Akt phosphorylation at Thr308 and Ser473 in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2B). Consistent with these findings, inhibition of Akt by Akt inhibitor III markedly blocked insulin-stimulated S6K and 4E-BP1 phosphorylation (Fig. 2C). Interestingly, an additive inhibitory effect on insulin-stimulated S6K and 4E-BP1 phosphorylation was observed when the cells were treated with both the Akt inhibitor and RSV (Fig. 2C), suggesting that RSV has an Akt-independent inhibitory effect on mTOR activity. To determine the mechanism by which RSV inhibits leucine-stimulated mTOR signaling, we examined whether leucine stimulates Akt phosphorylation in C2C12 cells. Although leucine significantly enhanced S6K phosphorylation, it had no stimulatory effect on Akt and ERK1/2 phosphorylation (Fig. 2D). In addition, leucine stimulated S6K phosphorylation in PDK1 knock-out MEFs (Fig. 2E). Taken together, these results suggest that, rather than suppressing the PI3K/PDK1/Akt signaling pathway, a distinct mechanism is involved in mediating the inhibitory effect of RSV on leucine-stimulated mTOR activation. mTOR signaling is negatively regulated by the TSC1/2 complex-mediated pathway (23Zhang H. Cicchetti G. Onda H. Koon H.B. Asrican K. Bajraszewski N. Vazquez F. Carpenter C.L. Kwiatkowski D.J. J. Clin. Invest. 2003; 112: 1223-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar, 24Potter C.J. Huang H. Xu T. Cell. 2001; 105: 357-368Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar). To investigate whether RSV inhibits mTOR signaling by acting on TSC1/2, we examined the effect of RSV on mTOR signaling in TSC1/2-null cells. As expected, the phosphorylation of S6K and 4E-BP was markedly increased in TSC1/2-deficient MEFs compared with wild-type MEFs (Fig. 3, A and B). Although insulin treatment had no significant effect on the TSC1/2 deficiency-induced increase in S6K and 4E-BP1 phosphorylation (Fig. 3B), the phosphorylation of S6K and 4E-BP1 was further stimulated by leucine in TSC-null cells (Fig. 3A). Interestingly, treating the cells with RSV greatly inhibited the leucine-stimulated phosphorylation of S6K and 4E-BP1 in TSC-null cells (Fig. 3A), suggesting that RSV inhibits mTOR signaling by activating at a site downstream of TSC1/2. Several recent studies suggest that the activation of the AMPK signaling pathway may play a role in the biological action of RSV (25Lin J.N. Lin V.C. Rau K.M. Shieh P.C. Kuo D.H. Shieh J.C. Chen W.J.

To determine the potential involvement of the AMPK signaling pathway in RSV-induced suppression of mTOR signaling, we examined S6K and 4E-BP1 phosphorylation in C2C12 cells in which the expression levels of AMPKα2 were suppressed by RNAi. Suppressing AMPKα2, which markedly inhibited AMPK activity (supplemental Fig. S1E), had no significant effect on leucine-stimulated mTOR signaling in C2C12 cells (Fig. 3C). In addition, the inhibitory effect of RSV on leucine-stimulated S6K phosphorylation remained intact in AMPKα2-suppressed cells (Fig. 3C), suggesting that RSV inhibits mTOR signaling via an AMPK-independent mechanism. To determine whether RSV has a direct effect on mTOR, we examined mTOR activity by in vitro kinase assays using purified GST-S6K1-(332–421) fusion protein as a substrate. We found that mTOR isolated from C2C12 myoblasts cotreated with leucine and RSV displayed a lower in vitro kinase activity compared with the protein isolated from cells treated with leucine alone (Fig. 4, A and B), suggesting that RSV has a direct effect on the activity of mTOR. Because TORC1 activity is regulated via association with its interacting protein such as the positive regulator Raptor (29Hara K. Maruki Y. Long X. Yoshino K. Oshiro N. Hidayat S. Tokunaga C.

We found that RSV treatment had no significant effect on the association between mTOR and Raptor (Fig. 4C). On the other hand, treating the cells with RSV greatly increased the association between mTOR and DEPTOR (Fig. 4C), a recently identified inhibitor of mTOR (19Peterson T.R. Laplante M. Thoreen C.C.

To provide further evidence that DEPTOR is involved in RSV-induced inhibition of mTOR signaling, we examined the effect of RSV on leucine-stimulated S6K phosphorylation in C2C12 cells in which the expression levels of DEPTOR were suppressed by RNAi. Consistent with a previous finding (19Peterson T.R. Laplante M. Thoreen C.C. Sancak Y. Kang S.A. Kuehl W.M. Gray N.S. Sabatini D.M. Cell. 2009; 137: 873-886Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (950) Google Scholar), mTOR signaling was significantly enhanced in DEPTOR-suppressed cells, as demonstrated by increased S6K phosphorylation (Fig. 4, D and E). Although leucine treatment further stimulated mTOR activation in DEPTOR-suppressed cells, the inhibitory effect of RSV on mTOR activity was greatly reduced in DEPTOR-suppressed cells (Fig. 4, D and E), suggesting that DEPTOR mediates the inhibitory effect of RSV on leucine-stimulated mTOR activation. RSV has been shown to exert numerous beneficial effects such as maintenance of glucose homeostasis, improvement of mitochondrial function, and extension of life span (31Baur J.A. Mech.

The mechanisms underlying the beneficial health roles of RSV remain elusive, but there is evidence suggesting that activation of Sirt1 could play a role (31Baur J.A. Mech.

However, several recent studies showed that RSV regulates cell growth, glucose homeostasis, and protection of the cardiovascular system via a Sirt1-independent mechanism (3Zhang J. Biochem. J. 2006; 397: 519-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 28Chan A.Y. Dolinsky V.W. Soltys C.L. Viollet B. Baksh S. Light P.E. Dyck J.R. J. Biol.

Oncol. 2010; 8: 25-33Google Scholar). In agreement with these latter findings, we found that RSV inhibits insulin- and leucine-stimulated mTOR signaling in Sirt1 knock-out MEFs (Fig. 1, E and F). In addition, inhibition of Sirt1 by sirtinol had no effect on insulin-stimulated mTOR signaling activation (supplemental Fig. S1D). Taken together, these results indicate that activation of Sirt1 is dispensable for the suppression effect of RSV on insulin- or leucine-stimulated mTOR signaling events. Although we found that RSV inhibits both insulin- and leucine-stimulated mTOR signaling, our results suggest that the mechanisms of inhibition are distinct. It is well established that insulin stimulates mTOR signaling by activating the PI3K/PDK1/Akt signaling pathway (11Scott P.H. Brunn G.J. Kohn A.D. Roth R.A. Lawrence Jr., J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1998; 95: 7772-7777Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar, 38Taha C. Liu Z. Jin J. Al-Hasani H. Sonenberg N. Klip A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33085-33091Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Suppressing this signaling pathway could thus provide a mechanism underlying the RSV-mediated inhibition of mTOR signaling. Consistent with this view, we found that RSV treatment inhibited insulin-stimulated Akt phosphorylation at Thr308 in C2C12 cells (Fig. 2B). This result is also consistent with a recent finding that RSV suppresses PI3K signaling by binding to the ATP-binding site of PI3K (37Jiang H. Shang X. Wu H. Gautam S.C. Al-Holou S. Li C. Kuo J. Zhang L. Chopp M. J. Exp. Ther. Oncol. 2010; 8: 25-33Google Scholar, 39Fröjdö S. Cozzone D. Vidal H. Pirola L. Biochem. J. 2007; 406: 511-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). However, inhibition of Akt did not completely block the inhibitory effect of RSV on mTOR activity (Fig. 2C), suggesting the presence of a distinct mechanism underlying the inhibitory effect of RSV on mTOR. We found that leucine activated mTOR signaling in C2C12 cells but had little effect on Akt activation (Fig. 2D). In addition, suppression of PDK1/Akt activity had little effect on leucine-stimulated S6K and 4E-BP1 phosphorylation (Figs. 2E). These results suggest that inhibition of the PI3K/PDK1/Akt signaling pathway is dispensable for the negative regulation RSV-promoted of leucine-stimulated mTOR signaling. There is some evidence indicating that RSV could exert its biological effect by activation of AMPK (40Dasgupta B. Milbrandt J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 7217-7222Crossref PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar, 41Gledhill J.R. Montgomery M.G. Leslie A.G. Walker J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 13632-13637Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). Because activation of AMPK enhances TSC1/2 activity that down-regulates mTOR signaling (42Wang C. Mao X. Wang L. Liu M. Wetzel M.D. Guan K.L. Dong L.Q. Liu F. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 7991-7996Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 43Memmott R.M. Dennis P.A. Cell. Signal. 2009; 21: 656-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar), it is possible that RSV inhibits leucine-stimulated mTOR signaling by activation of AMPK. However, we found that disruption of TSC1/2 expression or suppression of the expression levels of AMPK had little effect on leucine-stimulated mTOR signaling in C2C12 cells or MEFs (Fig. 3), suggesting that RSV negatively regulates leucine-stimulated mTOR signaling by a mechanism independent of the AMPK signaling pathway. Consistent with this view, we found that RSV treatment markedly increased the association between mTOR and DEPTOR (Fig. 4B). Because the binding of DEPTOR to mTOR has been shown to inhibit mTOR activity (19Peterson T.R. Laplante M. Thoreen C.C. Sancak Y. Kang S.A. Kuehl W.M. Gray N.S. Sabatini D.M. Cell. 2009; 137: 873-886Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (950) Google Scholar, 44Proud C.G. J. Mol. Cell Biol. 2009; 1: 61-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), this finding suggests that the enhanced interaction with DEPTOR could be a mechanism by which RSV inhibits insulin- and leucine-induced mTORC1 signaling. Consistent with this, suppressing DEPTOR expression levels by RNAi greatly diminished the inhibitory effect of RSV on leucine-stimulated mTORC1 signaling (Fig. 4C). Our study also showed that RSV treatment inhibited insulin-stimulated Akt phosphorylation at Ser473 (Fig. 2B), which is consistent with the finding that the binding of DEPTOR to mTOR suppresses both mTORC1 and mTORC2 activities (19Peterson T.R.

How RSV promotes the binding of DEPTOR to mTOR remains unknown. One possibility may be that RSV directly interacts with mTOR or DEPTOR, leading to enhanced interaction between these two proteins. Alternatively, RSV may indirectly promote the interaction between mTOR and DEPTOR by binding to an auxiliary protein. Similar to the latter model, rapamycin has been shown to impair the association between mTOR and Raptor through binding to FKBP12 (43Memmott R.M. Dennis P.A. Cell. Signal. 2009; 21: 656-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). It is also possible that RSV may activate a signaling pathway that leads to a chemical modification of either mTOR or DEPTOR, thus promoting the interaction between these proteins. Further studies will be needed to test these possibilities. In summary, we have provided evidence showing that RSV inhibits leucine-stimulated mTOR signaling via an Akt-independent mechanism. In addition, we have demonstrated that RSV enhances the interaction between mTOR and its negative regulator, DEPTOR, thus uncovering a novel mechanism by which RSV negatively regulates leucine-stimulated mTOR signaling in cells.

In this study we have combined genetic and biochemical approaches to examine the molecular mechanism of palmitate transfer of the yeast Ras PAT, which is composed of Erf2 and Erf4. The palmitoylation reaction consists of two steps; they are autopalmitoylation of the enzyme to create a palmitoyl-Erf2 intermediate followed by the transfer of the palmitoyl moiety to the Ras substrate. Palmitoyl-CoA serves as the palmitate donor. To elucidate the kinetic properties of the Erf2·Erf4 PAT, we have developed a coupled enzyme assay that monitors the turnover of the palmitoyl-enzyme species indirectly by measuring the rate of CoASH release. Mutational analysis indicates that the DHHC motif constitutes the catalytic core of the enzyme required for autopalmitoylation and palmitoyl transfer to the Ras2 substrate. In the absence of Ras2, the palmitoyl-Erf2·Erf4 complex undergoes a cycle of hydrolysis and re-palmitoylation, implying that in the presence of palmitoyl-CoA, the complex is autopalmitoylated and competent to transfer palmitate to a protein substrate.

Despite the central importance of protein palmitoylation in many physiological processes, the molecular mechanism of the palmitoylation reaction remains poorly understood. protein acyltransferase cysteine-rich domain 5′-fluoroorotic acid. There are 7 DHHC PATs in yeast and 23 in mammals (7Mitchell D.A. Vasudevan A. Linder M.E. Deschenes R.J. J. Lipid Res. 2006; 47: 1118-1127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). Based on in silico topology (TMPRED) computer simulations, the peptide loop containing the signature DHHC residues is predicted to immediately precede a transmembrane domain placing the DHHC motif in juxtaposition to the membrane (11Politis E.G. Roth A.F. Davis N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 10156-10163Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). In addition to the DHHC motif and the transmembrane domains, most but not all PATs contain a cysteine-rich domain (CRD) (7Mitchell D.A. Vasudevan A. Linder M.E. Deschenes R.J. J. Lipid Res. 2006; 47: 1118-1127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). The exceptions include Akr1, Akr2, Pfa5 (yeast), and DHHC22 (mammals), which lack one or more of the conserved cysteines and histidines that are found in most PATs. The significance of this difference is not clear but may lie in the hypothesis that the canonical CRD forms a zinc finger domain (12Putilina T. Wong P. Gentleman S. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1999; 195: 219-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 13Mesilaty-Gross S. Reich A. Motro B. Wides R. Gene. 1999; 231: 173-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). However, based on the high degree of conservation in the DHHC region, the sensitivity of the enzyme to neutral hydroxylamine, and the loss of activity when the cysteine residue is mutated, it has been hypothesized that the DHHC tetrapeptide is directly involved in catalysis (5Lobo S. Greentree W.K. Linder M.E. Deschenes R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 41268-41273Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar, 10Linder M.E. Deschenes R.J. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 4311-4320Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). All DHHC enzymes tested to date appear to transfer palmitate via a palmitoyl enzyme intermediate (7Mitchell D.A. Vasudevan A. Linder M.E. Deschenes R.J. J. Lipid Res. 2006; 47: 1118-1127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar, 14Fukata Y. Iwanaga T. Fukata M. Methods. 2006; 40: 177-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Using palmitoyl-CoA as the substrate, the PAT initiates the reaction forming palmitoylated enzyme, a process referred to as autopalmitoylation. To investigate the enzymatic properties of these proteins, we have chosen the Saccharomyces cerevisiae Ras PAT, Erf2·Erf4. Erf2·Erf4 is a heterodimeric PAT that palmitoylates yeast Ras2 on Cys-318, adjacent to the farnesylated cysteine, Cys-319. In the absence of protein substrate, PATs undergo autopalmitoylation when incubated with palmitoyl-CoA (7Mitchell D.A. Vasudevan A. Linder M.E. Deschenes R.J. J. Lipid Res. 2006; 47: 1118-1127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar, 14Fukata Y. Iwanaga T. Fukata M. Methods. 2006; 40: 177-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). In this study we describe assays capable of measuring the rates of different steps in the palmitoyl transferase reaction. Mutants of the CRD appear to be deficient in the autopalmitoylation reaction, and this explains their inability to palmitoylate Ras2 in vivo. We observe that the palmitoyl-PAT species can undergo hydrolysis, either liberating free palmitate or when present, transferring the palmitoyl moiety to the substrate. Our data suggest that in the absence of Ras2, Erf2·Erf4 loses the palmitate to water; however, in the presence of its substrate, the enzyme favors the substrate and transfers palmitate to Ras2. Yeast growth media were prepared as described previously (15Sherman F. Fink G.R. Hicks J.B. Laboratory Course Manual: Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1986Google Scholar). Cells were grown in synthetic complete medium or YPD (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, and 2% glucose) medium (15Sherman F. Fink G.R. Hicks J.B. Laboratory Course Manual: Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1986Google Scholar). Induction of GAL1, 10 promoters were achieved by adding 4% galactose to synthetic complete medium. Yeast transformations were performed using the lithium acetate procedure (16Ito H. Fukuda Y. Murata K. Kimura A. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 153: 163-168Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Yeast strain RDY1830 (MATα ade2-1 leu2-3 ura3-52 trp1-1 his3-11,15 can1-100 GAL+ psi+ erf2Δ::NATr) was constructed from RDY1785 (MATα ade2-1 leu2-3 ura3-52 trp1-1 his3-11,15 can1-100 GAL+ psi+) by replacing ERF2 with a PCR-generated NATr gene from p4339 (Gift from Charlie Boone) using deoxyoligonucleotides erf2:NAT-F and erf2:NAT-R (Table 1), which contain sequences 5′ and 3′ of the ERF2 ORF, respectively. The same approach was used to construct RDY1831 (MATa ade2-1 leu2-3 ura3-52 trp1-1 his3-11,15 can1-100 GAL+ psi+ erf2Δ::NATr) and from RDY1786 (MATa ade2-1 leu2-3 ura3-52 trp1-1 his3-11,15 can1-100 GAL+ psi+). Diploid strain RDY1827 was constructed by mating RDY1830 with RDY1831.TABLE 1ERF2 mutant oligodeoxyribonucleic acids used in these studiesNameSequenceErf2-FCGC ACA AGG GAT CCA TGG CCT TGG TCT CTA GAA GGT CGErf2-RCGG GCT CGA GTT AAT GAT GAT GAT GAT GAT GAT GTA TTT TCT GTA TTT TTT CAA AGCErf2 D131A-FCAC TAG TGC TCC TGG CGT TCT TCC GAGErf2 D131A-RCTC GGA AGA ACG CCA GGA GCA CTA GTGErf2 P132A-FGCC ACT AGT GAT GCT GGC GTT CTT CCErf2 P132A-RGGA AGA ACG CCA GCA TCA CTA GTG GCErf2 H163A-FTGA AAT TGA AGA CGC CGT TGG TAG TGT TAT CErf2 H163A-RGAT AAC ACT ACC AAC GGC GTC TTC AAT TTC AErf2 K173A-FGAC ATT ACT ATC GCG TAT TGT CCA TCAErf2 K173A-RTGA TGG ACA ATA CGC GAT AGT AAT GTCErf2 C175S-FCAT TAC TAT CAA GTAT TCC CCA TCA TGT AGG ATA GErf2 C175S-RCAT ATC CTA CAT GAT GGG GAA TAC TTG ATA GTA ATGErf2 C178S-FCAA GTA TTG TCC ATC ATC TAG AAT ATG GAG ACC ACC TCErf2 C178S-RGAG GTG GTC TCC ATA TTC TAG ATG ATG GAC AAT ACT TGErf2 R182A-FTGT AGG ATA TGG GCA CCA CCT CGG TCTErf2 R182A-RAGA CCG AGG TGG TGC CCA TAT CCT ACAErf2 R185A-FTGG AGA CCA CCT GCG TCT TCT CAC TGTErf2 R185A-RACA GTG AGA AGA CGC AGG TGG TCT CCAErf2 H188A-FCCT CGG TCT TCT GCC TGT TCC ACA TGErf2 H188A-RCAT GTG GAA CAG GCA GAA GAC CGA GGErf2 C189S-FCTC GGT CTT CTC ACT CTT CCA CAT GTA ACG TCT GErf2 C189S-RCAG ACG TTA CAT GTG GAA GAG TGA GAA GAC CGA GErf2 C192S-FCTC ACT GTT CCA CAT CTA ACG TCT GCG TAA TGErf2 C192S-RCAT TAC GCA GAC GTT AGA TGT GGA ACA GTG AGErf2 C195S-FCAC ATG TAA CGT CTC CGT AAT GGT TCA TGErf2 C195S-RCAT GAA CCA TTA CGG AGA CGT TAC ATG TGErf2 D200A-FCGT AAT GGT TCA TGC CCA CCAT TGC ATA TGGErf2 D200A-RCCA TAT GCA ATG GTG GGC ATG AAC CAT TAC GErf2 H201A-FGTA ATG GTT CAT GAC GCC CAT TGC ATA TGGErf2 H201A-RCCA TAT GCA ATG GGC GTC ATG AAC CAT TACErf2 H202A-FGGT TCA TGA CCA CGC TTG CAT ATG GGT CErf2 H202A-RGAC CCA TAT GCA AGC GTG GTC ATG AAC CErf2 C203S-FGGT TCA TGA CCA CCA TTC AAT ATG GGT CAA TAA TTG CAT AGErf2 C203S-RCTA TGC AAT TAT TGA CCC ATA TTG AAT GGT GGT CAT GAA CCErf2 W205A-FCAT GAC CAC CAT TGC ATA GCG GTC AAT AAT TCA TAGErf2 W205A-RCTA TGC AAT TAT TGA CCG CTA TGC AAT GGT GGT CAT GErf2 C209S-FGCA TAT GGG TCA ATA ATT CAA TTG GAA AAA GGA ACT ACC GGErf2 C209S-RCCG GTA GTT CCT TTT TCC AAT TGA ATT ATT GAC CCA TAT GCErf2 N214A-FGCA TAG GAA AAA GGA GCT ACC GGT TCErf2 N214A-RGAA CCG GTA GCT CCT TTT TCC TAT GCErf2 F218S-FCTA CCG GTT CTC TTT AAT ATT CCT GTT AGG TGCErf2 F218S-RGCA CCT AAC AGG AAT ATT AAA GAG AAC CGG TAGErf2 E286A-FCAG CAA ACA ACA AGG GCA TTT TTG AAA GGT ATT GGErf2 E286A-RCCA ATA CCT TTC AAA AAT GCC CTT GTT GTT TGC TGerf2:NAT-FGCCTTGTCTAGAAGGACAAGATCGGAAAGCACCTCAATAACAAAGGAAGACATGGAGGCCCAGAATACCCTerf2:NAT-RTATTTTCTGTATTTTTTCAAAGCTGTGTGCTGGCGATAAATCCATAAATCTCCAACAGTATAGCGACCAGCATTCACGST-mCherryAGCCACGTTTGGTGGTGGCGACCATCCTCCAAAATCGGATATGGTGAGCAAGGGCGAGGAGGmCherry-Ras2GCTTGCTGCTTCCTAGCCTGTTTAGCATTTGAAACTTGACCCTTGTACAGCTCGTCCATGCCG Open table in a new tab The construction of pESC-His6-Erf2-FLAG-Erf4 has been described previously (17Budde C. Schoenfish M.J. Linder M.E. Deschenes R.J. Methods. 2006; 40: 143-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Deoxyoligonucleotides used to construct ERF2 alleles are listed in Table 1. His6-ERF2 alleles were constructed using the QuikChange II site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) as per the manufacturer's instructions. Isolates produced from the mutagenesis protocol were sequenced to confirm the ERF2 allele changes (Table 2). Low-copy versions of these alleles lacking the His6 tag were constructed into B642 (Table 2). Briefly, the mutants were amplified using PCR with ERF2 alleles described above as templates and deoxyoligonucleotides Erf2-F and Erf2-R as primers. The Erf2-F and Erf2-R deoxyoligonucleotides have sequences that overlap with the 5′ and 3′ ends of the ERF2 ORF, respectively. The ERF2 alleles were introduced into the B642 through homologous recombination by first deleting part of the ERF2 ORF with NcoI and NruI and then transforming the PCR product and the “gapped” plasmid simultaneously into RJY-1330 and selecting for Trp+ colonies. Plasmids were rescued (18Robzyk K. Kassir Y. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 3790Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar) and the DNA was sequenced to confirm the presence of the mutations (GeneWiz, South Plainfield, NJ).TABLE 2Plasmids usedNumberNameRef.B1302pESC(HIS6)ERF2-(FLAG)ERF4Ref. 17Budde C.

Transformants were selected by growth on medium lacking uracil and histidine (pMA210) (20Ma J. Ptashne M. Cell. 1987; 48: 847-853Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar). Plasmids were rescued from the transformants (18Robzyk K. Kassir Y. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 3790Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar), and the presence of the mCherry gene was determined by DNA sequencing (GeneWiz, South Plainfield, NJ). The in vivo function of the mutants along with the wild type protein was investigated using our previously described complementation assay (3Bartels D.J. Mitchell D.A. Dong X. Deschenes R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6775-6787Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Briefly, in this assay, cells contain a defective allele of RAS2 that is balanced by an episomal copy of RAS2 linked to URA3. Under these conditions, the loss of ERF2 gene is permissible as long as the cell maintains the RAS2/URA3-based episome. This is detected by their ability or inability of the strain to grow on medium supplemented with 5′-fluoroorotic acid (FOA) (21Boeke J.D. Trueheart J. Natsoulis G. Fink G.R. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 164-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (1083) Google Scholar). Cells carrying ERF2 alleles were transformed into RJY1330 and plated on synthetic medium containing glucose and lacking tryptophan. Colonies were inoculated into liquid synthetic medium containing glucose or raffinose (both lacking tryptophan) and grown to an A600 of between 0.8 and 1.2. The cell density was determined by monitoring absorbance using a spectrophotometer at 600 nm. 1:10 serial dilutions were made starting with 10,000 cells. The cells were spotted onto synthetic medium containing or lacking 5′-FOA as presented in the figures. Strain RJY1827 was transformed with pESC(His6)ERF2-(FLAG)ERF4 and pMA210 and grown in SC(−Leu−His) medium containing 2% (v/v) ethanol, 2% (v/v) glycerol at 30 °C. The cultures were grown to 2 × 107 cells/ml and then induced by adding galactose to a final concentration of 4%. Cells were induced for 17h (30 °C) and then harvested by centrifugation at 3000 × g for 15 min, the pellet was resuspended in breaking buffer (50 mm Tris pH 8, 500 ml NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 1× Protease Inhibitor Cocktail (Roche), 8 μl/ml PMSF), and the cells were lysed using glass beads (400–600 mesh, Sigma) for 40 min with 1.5-min pulses. The resulting extract was spun at 3000 × g for 15 min to remove cellular debris and unbroken cells followed by a crude membrane fraction (P100) by centrifugation (100,000 × g) for 1.5 h at 4 °C with a Beckman® 50.2 Ti rotor. The supernatant was discarded, and the pellet was resuspended in Tris-buffered saline, pH 7.4, with the aid of a Dounce homogenizer. The resulting extract was adjusted to a final concentration of 0.8% dodecylmaltoside, 500 mm NaCl, and 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol. To solubilize the membranes, the extract was incubated at 4 °C (1.5 h). To aid in purification, urea and imidazole were added to a final concentration of 2.4 m and 1 mm, respectively. Insoluble material was then removed by centrifugation (10,000 × g) for 15 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was incubated with nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin at 4 °C for 1 h. The resin was washed once with Solution W (50 mm Tris·HCl, pH 8.5, 0.08% dodecylmaltoside, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol) containing 300 mm NaCl and then twice with Solution W containing 150 mm NaCl. The protein was eluted with 50 mm Tris HCl, pH 8.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.08% dodecylmaltoside, 5% glycerol, and 250 mm imidazole. Eluates were desalted, and the buffer was changed to SPB (50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.8, 10% glycerol) using a column of G-25 resin. Fractions containing His6-Erf2/FLAG-Erf4 were pooled to obtain ∼0.5 mg of purified Ras PAT per liter of culture. The GST-mCherry-Ras2 substrate used in Erf2·Erf4 palmitoylation assays was purified as described earlier (17Budde C. Schoenfish M.J. Linder M.E. Deschenes R.J. Methods. 2006; 40: 143-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Previously, using truncated constructs, we showed that the C-terminal 35 amino acids of Ras2 are sufficient for substrate recognition and catalysis (19Dong X. Mitchell D.A. Lobo S. Zhao L. Bartels D.J. Deschenes R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 6574-6584Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Therefore, we expressed and purified GST-mCherry-Ras2 CT35 as the substrate for in vitro assays with Erf2·Erf4. The production of NADH was monitored as a single cuvette platform and a 96-well platform. In the single cuvette platform the production of NADH was monitored using a PTI Double-Double Quantum Master 3 Fluorimeter (340-nm excitation/465-nm emission). The 200-μl reaction contained 2 mm α-ketoglutarate, 0.25 mm NAD+, 0.2 mm thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP), 3 μg of Erf2·Erf4, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 30 milliunits of α-KDH, and 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 6.8. The reaction was initiated by the addition of 25 μm palmitoyl-CoA and monitored for 5 min at 30 °C. The reaction proceeded linearly throughout the 5-min monitoring phase and maintained its linearity for more than 25 min (data not shown). To further validate the assay, two types of controls were performed. Boiling the enzyme (Erf2/4) abolished formation of NADH, showing that there is no measurable background hydrolysis palmitoyl-CoA. Second, a mutant form of Erf2 (Erf2C203S) had no detectable activity. For the 96-well platform, the production of NADH was monitored with a Biotek Mx fluorimeter (Biotek, Winooski, VT) using 340-nm excitation/465-nm emission. The 200-μl reaction contained 2 mm 2-oxoglutarate (α-ketoglutamic acid), 0.25 mm NAD+, 0.2 mm thiamine pyrophosphate, 0.4–1 μg of purified His-Erf2/FLAG-Erf4, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 32 milliunits 2-oxogluarate dehydrogenase (α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase), and 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 6.8. The reaction was initiated by the addition of different concentrations of palmitoyl-CoA and monitored for 30 min at 30 °C. The first 10 min of the reaction was analyzed to determine the initial rates of CoASH release. The PAT specific activity was determined from a standard curve of NADH production with different CoASH amounts. In these reactions CoASH was added to the standard PAT reaction mixture (without Erf2·Erf4 complex or palmitoyl-CoA), and the reaction was allowed to proceed to equilibrium before fluorescence was measured (excitation, 340 nm/emission, 465 nm). To validate the assay, a negative control was used in which the enzyme was boiled. Boiled enzyme produced significantly less fluorescence (<20%), suggesting no significant contribution from sample heterogeneity or nonspecific fluorescence. Palmitoylation assays were performed as previously described (17Budde C. Schoenfish M.J. Linder M.E. Deschenes R.J. Methods. 2006; 40: 143-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. The reaction consisted of 50 mm sodium phosphate Buffer, pH 7.4, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 10 pmol of purified His-Erf2/FLAG-Erf4, 1 μCi of 30 Ci/mmol (666 nm final concentration) [9,10-3H]palmitoyl-CoA (American Radiolabeled Chemicals, St. Louis, MO) in a total volume of 50 μl with or without 200 pmol of GST-mCherry-Ras2 substrate. For measuring the kinetics of steady-state product formation (palmitoyl-Erf2 or palmitoyl-Ras2), the reaction was allowed to proceed for different time periods ranging from 0 to 60 min at 30 °C and stopped using SDS-PAGE gel loading buffer. The palmitoylated proteins were separated using SDS-PAGE, and autoradiography was performed to determine the labeled proteins in the gel. For performing the kinetics of autopalmitoylation reaction and measuring the initial rates of the consumption of substrates and the release of products, 20 pmol of purified Erf2·Erf4 was mixed with 240 pmol of [3H]palmitoyl CoA in the presence of 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, with 0.5 mm DTT, and aliquots were taken at various intervals ranging from 5 s to 600 s. The components were separated using thin-layer chromatography on a silica G60 plate using n-butanol/water/acetic acid (50/30/20) as the mobile phase. Running the aliquots on a TLC plate effectively terminated the reaction (data not shown). Radioactivity located at the origin corresponded to [3H]palmitoyl-Erf2 (Rf = 0.0). [3H]Palmitoyl-CoA had an Rf = 0.45, and [3H]palmitate had an Rf = 0.9. After allowing the samples to separate in the mobile phase, the plates were air-dried overnight. The spots corresponding to the three species were scraped and placed in scintillation mixture. To determine the efficiency of counting, known amounts of [3H]palmitoyl-CoA and [3H]palmitate were separated using the same mobile phase, dried, and scraped, and the amount of radioactivity was determined. Efficiency corrections were made of 0.7 (palmitate) and 0.6 (palmitoyl-CoA). An efficiency correction of 0.25 was made for [3H]palmitoyl-Erf2. The amount of [3H]palmitoyl-Erf2 was the difference between the amount of hydrolyzed [3H]palmitoyl-CoA and the amount of [3H]palmitate. Based on the specific activity of the [3H]palmitoyl-CoA, we calculated the amount of palmitate released, palmitoylated Erf2 formed, and CoASH released. The amount of CoASH was determined indirectly by subtracting the amount of unused [3H]palmitoyl-CoA at each time point from the total amount in the reaction. When Ras2 was present, a similar approach was used to measure the release of palmitate and CoASH. However, the “origin” was not scraped as it contained heterogeneous species, i.e. palmitoyl-Erf2 and palmitoyl-Ras2. Only spots corresponding to palmitate and palmitoyl-CoA were analyzed. The conserved DHHC-CRD domain of PATs encompass 51 residues within the predicted cytoplasmic loop between transmembrane spanning domains 2 and 3. To determine how the DHHC-CRD of Erf2 contributes to autopalmitoylation and Ras2 palmitoyl transfer activity of the Erf2·Erf4 PAT, FLAG epitope-tagged Erf2 (either N or C terminus) proteins (Fig. 1A) were expressed and purified with Erf4 as described earlier (17Budde C. Schoenfish M.J. Linder M.E. Deschenes R.J. Methods. 2006; 40: 143-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The C-terminal epitope tag resulted in a protein with lower activity for autopalmitoylation and palmitoyl transfer to Ras2 (Fig. 1B), and therefore, all subsequent experiments were performed with the N-terminal FLAG-tagged protein. The presence or absence of the N- and C-terminal regions had no measurable effect on the autopalmitoylation activity of Erf2·Erf4; however, deletion of either region dramatically decreased palmitate transfer to Ras2 in vitro and in vivo (Fig. 1C). The retention of autopalmitoylation by Erf2 truncation proteins indicated that the catalytic residues for autopalmitoylation were located between amino acid residues 119 and 301. The regions of highest sequence identity included a DPG sequence element and DHHC-CRD domain between TM2 and TM3 as well as a TTXE motif in the C-terminal region after TM3 (Fig. 2). To identify additional residues required for function, 21 mutations were created and tested by the in vivo complementation assay (Fig. 2). Mutations C175S, C178S, R185A, H188A, C189S, C192S, C195S, D200A, H201A, H202A, C203S, C209S, or F218S resulted in loss of function, whereas others (K173A, K/R182A, W205A, and N214S) supported growth in medium containing 5′-FOA and palmitoylation-dependent growth in vivo. Not all mutations in consensus sequences produced non-functional alleles of Erf2. The proline in sequence DPG (Asp-Pro-Gly) and glutamate in sequence TTXE (Thr-Thr-Xaa-Glu) were found in all but one of the yeast and human DHHC PATs. However, alanine substitutions at Pro-132 and Glu-286 had no measurable effect on Erf2 function and were not pursued further. Erf2 CRD mutations comprising the atypical zinc finger (CX2CX9HCX2C) between residues Cys-175 and Cys-195, inclusive, resulted in a loss of function phenotype (Fig. 2). Purification of these mutant proteins was not successful, suggesting that the mutant proteins were structurally unstable (data not shown). To study the role of the amino acid residues of the active site, thin layer chromatography was used to monitor the products of the autopalmitoylation reaction over time. Surprisingly, steady-state levels of the palmitoyl-Erf2 intermediate occurred by the earliest time point (5 s), suggesting burst kinetics (Fig."
https://openalex.org/W2042125973,"Runx2 is a critical transcription factor for osteoblast differentiation. Regulation of Runx2 expression levels and transcriptional activity is important for bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)-induced osteoblast differentiation. Previous studies have shown that extracellular signal-regulated kinase (Erk) activation enhances the transcriptional activity of Runx2 and that BMP-induced Runx2 acetylation increases Runx2 stability and transcriptional activity. Because BMP signaling induces Erk activation in osteoblasts, we sought to investigate whether BMP-induced Erk signaling regulates Runx2 acetylation and stability. Erk activation by overexpression of constitutively active MEK1 increased Runx2 transcriptional activity, whereas U0126, an inhibitor of MEK1/2, suppressed basal Runx2 transcriptional activity and BMP-induced Runx2 acetylation and stabilization. Overexpression of constitutively active MEK1 stabilized Runx2 protein via up-regulation of acetylation and down-regulation of ubiquitination. Erk activation increased p300 protein levels and histone acetyltransferase activity. Knockdown of p300 using siRNA diminished Erk-induced Runx2 stabilization. Overexpression of Smad5 increased Runx2 acetylation and stabilization. Erk activation further increased Smad-induced Runx2 acetylation and stabilization, whereas U0126 suppressed these functions. On the other hand, knockdown of Smad1 and Smad5 by siRNA suppressed both basal and Erk-induced Runx2 protein levels. Erk activation enhanced the association of Runx2 with p300 and Smad1. Taken together these results indicate that Erk signaling increases Runx2 stability and transcriptional activity, partly via increasing p300 protein levels and histone acetyltransferase activity and subsequently increasing Runx2 acetylation by p300. In addition to the canonical Smad pathway, a BMP-induced non-Smad Erk signaling pathway cooperatively regulates osteoblast differentiation partly via increasing the stability and transcriptional activity of Runx2."
https://openalex.org/W1984134856,"Mutations in ATP8b1 are found in certain individuals susceptible to pneumonia. Ray et al. now report that bacterial pneumonia is associated with elevated levels of the phospholipid cardiolipin in airway fluids, that ATP8b1 is a cardiolipin importer and that excessive cardiolipin in the lung contributes to impaired lung function. The findings suggest that ATP8b1 might be a new therapeutic target for the treatment of pneumonia. Pneumonia remains the leading cause of death from infection in the US, yet fundamentally new conceptual models underlying its pathogenesis have not emerged. We show that humans and mice with bacterial pneumonia have markedly elevated amounts of cardiolipin, a rare, mitochondrial-specific phospholipid, in lung fluid and find that it potently disrupts surfactant function. Intratracheal cardiolipin administration in mice recapitulates the clinical phenotype of pneumonia, including impaired lung mechanics, modulation of cell survival and cytokine networks and lung consolidation. We have identified and characterized the activity of a unique cardiolipin transporter, the P-type ATPase transmembrane lipid pump Atp8b1, a mutant version of which is associated with severe pneumonia in humans and mice. Atp8b1 bound and internalized cardiolipin from extracellular fluid via a basic residue–enriched motif. Administration of a peptide encompassing the cardiolipin binding motif or Atp8b1 gene transfer in mice lessened bacteria-induced lung injury and improved survival. The results unveil a new paradigm whereby Atp8b1 is a cardiolipin importer whose capacity to remove cardiolipin from lung fluid is exceeded during inflammation or when Atp8b1 is defective. This discovery opens the door for new therapeutic strategies directed at modulating the abundance or molecular interactions of cardiolipin in pneumonia."
https://openalex.org/W2076560278,"Lipids circulate in the blood in association with plasma lipoproteins and enter the tissues either after hydrolysis or as non-hydrolyzable lipid esters. We studied cardiac lipids, lipoprotein lipid uptake, and gene expression in heart-specific lipoprotein lipase (LpL) knock-out (hLpL0), CD36 knock-out (Cd36(-/-)), and double knock-out (hLpL0/Cd36(-/-)-DKO) mice. Loss of either LpL or CD36 led to a significant reduction in heart total fatty acyl-CoA (control, 99.5 ± 3.8; hLpL0, 36.2 ± 3.5; Cd36(-/-), 57.7 ± 5.5 nmol/g, p < 0.05) and an additive effect was observed in the DKO (20.2 ± 1.4 nmol/g, p < 0.05). Myocardial VLDL-triglyceride (TG) uptake was reduced in the hLpL0 (31 ± 6%) and Cd36(-/-) (47 ± 4%) mice with an additive reduction in the DKO (64 ± 5%) compared with control. However, LpL but not CD36 deficiency decreased VLDL-cholesteryl ester uptake. Endogenously labeled mouse chylomicrons were produced by tamoxifen treatment of β-actin-MerCreMer/LpL(flox/flox) mice. Induced loss of LpL increased TG levels >10-fold and reduced HDL by >50%. After injection of these labeled chylomicrons in the different mice, chylomicron TG uptake was reduced by ∼70% and retinyl ester by ∼50% in hLpL0 hearts. Loss of CD36 did not alter either chylomicron TG or retinyl ester uptake. LpL loss did not affect uptake of remnant lipoproteins from ApoE knock-out mice. Our data are consistent with two pathways for fatty acid uptake; a CD36 process for VLDL-derived fatty acid and a non-CD36 process for chylomicron-derived fatty acid uptake. In addition, our data show that lipolysis is involved in uptake of core lipids from TG-rich lipoproteins."

https://openalex.org/W2126063601,"Alternative pre-mRNA splicing occurs extensively in the nervous systems of complex organisms, including humans, considerably expanding the potential size of the proteome. Cell-specific alternative pre-mRNA splicing is thought to optimize protein function for specialized cellular tasks, but direct evidence for this is limited. Transmission of noxious thermal stimuli relies on the activity of N-type Ca(V)2.2 calcium channels in nociceptors. Using an exon-replacement strategy in mice, we show that mutually exclusive splicing patterns in the Ca(V)2.2 gene modulate N-type channel function in nociceptors, leading to a change in morphine analgesia. Exon 37a (e37a) enhances μ-opioid receptor-mediated inhibition of N-type calcium channels by promoting activity-independent inhibition. In the absence of e37a, spinal morphine analgesia is weakened in vivo but the basal response to noxious thermal stimuli is not altered. Our data suggest that highly specialized, discrete cellular responsiveness in vivo can be attributed to alternative splicing events regulated at the level of individual neurons."
https://openalex.org/W1975530669,"Fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) is a potent antidiabetic and triglyceride-lowering hormone whose hepatic expression is highly responsive to food intake. FGF21 induction in the adaptive response to fasting has been well studied, but the molecular mechanism responsible for feeding-induced repression remains unknown. In this study, we demonstrate a novel link between FGF21 and a key circadian output protein, E4BP4. Expression of Fgf21 displays a circadian rhythm, which peaks during the fasting phase and is anti-phase to E4bp4, which is elevated during feeding periods. E4BP4 strongly suppresses Fgf21 transcription by binding to a D-box element in the distal promoter region. Depletion of E4BP4 in synchronized Hepa1c1c-7 liver cells augments the amplitude of Fgf21 expression, and overexpression of E4BP4 represses FGF21 secretion from primary mouse hepatocytes. Mimicking feeding effects, insulin significantly increases E4BP4 expression and binding to the Fgf21 promoter through AKT activation. Thus, E4BP4 is a novel insulin-responsive repressor of FGF21 expression during circadian cycles and feeding."
https://openalex.org/W2154993714,"Although genome-wide hypomethylation is a hallmark of many cancers, roles for active DNA demethylation during tumorigenesis are unknown. Here, loss of the APC tumor suppressor gene causes upregulation of a DNA demethylase system and the concomitant hypomethylation of key intestinal cell fating genes. Notably, this hypomethylation maintained zebrafish intestinal cells in an undifferentiated state that was released upon knockdown of demethylase components. Mechanistically, the demethylase genes are directly activated by Pou5f1 and Cebpβ and are indirectly repressed by retinoic acid, which antagonizes Pou5f1 and Cebpβ. Apc mutants lack retinoic acid as a result of the transcriptional repression of retinol dehydrogenase l1 via a complex that includes Lef1, Groucho2, Ctbp1, Lsd1, and Corest. Our findings imply a model wherein APC controls intestinal cell fating through a switch in DNA methylation dynamics. Wild-type APC and retinoic acid downregulate demethylase components, thereby promoting DNA methylation of key genes and helping progenitors commit to differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W2063418623,"Bax and Bak are pro-apoptotic factors that are required for cell death by the mitochondrial or intrinsic pathway. Bax is found in an inactive state in the cytosol and upon activation is targeted to the mitochondrial outer membrane where it releases cytochrome c and other factors that cause caspase activation. Although Bak functions in the same way as Bax, it is constitutively localized to the mitochondrial outer membrane. In the membrane, Bak activation is inhibited by the voltage-dependent anion channel isoform 2 (VDAC2) by an unknown mechanism. Using blue native gel electrophoresis, we show that in healthy cells endogenous inactive Bak exists in a 400-kDa complex that is dependent on the presence of VDAC2. Activation of Bak is concomitant with its release from the 400-kDa complex and the formation of lower molecular weight species. Furthermore, substitution of the Bak transmembrane anchor with that of the mitochondrial outer membrane tail-anchored protein hFis1 prevents association of Bak with the VDAC2 complex and increases the sensitivity of cells to an apoptotic stimulus. Our results suggest that VDAC2 interacts with the hydrophobic tail of Bak to sequester it in an inactive state in the mitochondrial outer membrane, thereby raising the stimulation threshold necessary for permeabilization of the mitochondrial outer membrane and cell death.

Apoptosis is a physiological process for eliciting cell death and is essential for the normal growth and development of multicellular organisms. Studies on gene-deleted mice have shown that the presence of either one of the pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members, Bak or Bax, is necessary for cell death by the “intrinsic” pathway, which can be inhibited by Bcl-2 (1Chipuk J.E.

Cell Biol. 2008; 9: 47-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (3607) Google Scholar). In this pathway, also known as the “mitochondrial” pathway, Bak and Bax act on the mitochondrial outer membrane to cause release of molecules such as cytochrome c, which binds to Apaf-1 in the cytosol triggering formation of the apoptosome (2Youle R.J. Strasser A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2008; 9: 47-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (3607) Google Scholar). The mechanisms that regulate Bak and Bax activation, and how they cause the mitochondrial outer membranes to become permeable, are not well understood. Current models for inducing cytochrome c release include the following: (a) Bak and Bax forming large pores themselves (2Youle R.J. Strasser A. Nat. Rev. Mol.

Science. 2003; 301: 513-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar) showed that the minor voltage-dependent anion channel isoform 2, VDAC2, interacts with the inactive conformer of Bak. VDAC proteins constitute the major gateways for metabolite flux across the mitochondrial outer membrane, and in mammalian cells three isoforms (VDAC1, VDAC2, and VDAC3) can substitute for each other in metabolic exchange (18Craigen W.J. Graham B.H. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 2008; 40: 207-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Although VDACs have been implicated in regulating apoptosis, conflicting studies have suggested that they may either promote or prevent apoptosis. For example, it was proposed that VDACs are part of the mitochondrial permeability transition complex, which can cause MOMP, resulting in cell death (3Shoshan-Barmatz V. Keinan N. Zaid H. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 2008; 40: 183-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). On the other hand, it was reported that Bcl-xL binds directly to VDAC1 to maintain ATP/ADP exchange (19Vander Heiden M.G. Chandel N.S. Schumacker P.T. Thompson C.B. Mol.

In vitro, VDAC species purified from rat mitochondria could be induced by Bax or Bak to form a channel large enough to release cytochrome c, and this could be prevented by Bcl-xL (21Shimizu S. Narita M. Tsujimoto Y. Nature. 1999; 399: 483-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (1928) Google Scholar). In contrast, it was found that the BH3-only protein tBid affected gating of VDAC channels rather than Bax (22Rostovtseva T.K. Antonsson B. Suzuki M. Youle R.J. Colombini M. Bezrukov S.M. J. Biol.

The study by Cheng et al. (14Cheng E.H. Sheiko T.V. Fisher J.K. Craigen W.J. Korsmeyer S.J. Science. 2003; 301: 513-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar) suggested that association of Bak with VDAC2 maintains Bak in an inactive form in healthy cells. Death stimuli, such as treatment with tBid, was shown to abolish the interaction between Bak and VDAC2, allowing apoptosis to proceed (14Cheng E.H. Sheiko T.V. Fisher J.K. Craigen W.J. Korsmeyer S.J. Science. 2003; 301: 513-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar). Consistent with these observations, vdac1- and vdac3-deficient mice are viable, whereas embryos with a homozygous deletion of vdac2 die during development (14Cheng E.H. Sheiko T.V. Fisher J.K. Craigen W.J. Korsmeyer S.J. Science. 2003; 301: 513-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar). In vdac2−/− cells activation of Bak was enhanced, and the cells had increased sensitivity to apoptotic stimuli (14Cheng E.H. Sheiko T.V. Fisher J.K. Craigen W.J. Korsmeyer S.J. Science. 2003; 301: 513-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar). In contrast, others have suggested a pro-apoptotic role for VDAC2 and have reported that it is required for the mitochondrial targeting and activation of Bak (24Setoguchi K. Otera H. Mihara K. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 5635-5647Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 25Roy S.S. Ehrlich A.M. Craigen W.J. Hajnóczky G. EMBO Rep. 2009; 10: 1341-1347Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). To provide fresh insights into the mechanisms that regulate MOMP, we analyzed Bak complexes in mitochondria using blue native electrophoresis. Our results showed that in healthy cells endogenous Bak exists in a 400-kDa complex in the mitochondrial outer membrane, and release of Bak from this complex coincides with Bak activation, MOMP, and cytochrome c release. The 400-kDa Bak complex is dependent on the presence of VDAC2. Furthermore, replacement of the Bak transmembrane anchor with that of another mitochondrially targeted protein prevented association of Bak with the 400-kDa complex and lowered the threshold for apoptosis. This indicates that the interaction with VDAC2 involves the Bak transmembrane domain, and in the absence of VDAC2, or when the transmembrane domain is replaced, Bak does not spontaneously activate, but the threshold for activation is markedly reduced. Bak, Bak-hFis1TM, and Tom22 were amplified from pGEM4Z using M13 forward and reverse primers to generate RNA using the in vitro mMESSAGE mMachine SP6 kit from Ambion. RNA was isolated by LiCl precipitation according to the manufacturer's instructions and applied to in vitro translation reactions using rabbit reticulocyte lysate (Promega) in the presence of [35S]methionine/cysteine protein labeling mix (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) as described previously (26Lazarou M.

Science. 2003; 301: 513-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar) mice were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, 250 μm l-asparagine, and 55 μm 2-mercaptoethanol under an atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% air. Wild type (WT) Bak, BakI81T, and Bak-hFis1TM were stably introduced into DKO MEFs by lentiviral infection as described previously (34Dunning C.J. McKenzie M. Sugiana C. Lazarou M. Silke J. Connelly A. Fletcher J.M. Kirby D.M. Thorburn D.R. Ryan M.T. EMBO J. 2007; 26: 3227-3237Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Monoclonal populations were selected based on positive protein expression following induction with 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4-HT). For equal protein expression, WT Bak, BakI81T, and Bak-hFis1TM were induced with 18, 5, and 200 nm 4-HT, respectively. No effect on cell viability was observed with 200 nm 4-HT (data not shown). Both nontransduced and transduced DKO MEFs were seeded on 6-well tissue culture plates at ∼60% confluency and allowed to adhere for 12- 24 h before addition of 4-HT for 16 h. The 4-HT containing medium was removed at which time the cells were supplemented with medium either lacking or containing 10 μm etoposide (Sigma). Cells were incubated with etoposide for 24 h. Cell death was analyzed by annexin V-FITC (Invitrogen) staining and flow cytometry. In each sample, 10,000 events were measured, and cell death (annexin V-FITC-positive cells) was quantified. To study mitochondrial import and assembly of Bak, we used an in vitro mitochondrial import assay (35Stojanovski D. Pfanner N. Wiedemann N. Methods Cell Biol. 2007; 80: 783-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Bak was translated in vitro using rabbit reticulocyte lysate in the presence of [35S]methionine and incubated with mitochondria that were freshly isolated from HeLa cells. Mitochondria were solubilized in digitonin buffer and analyzed by blue native PAGE (BN-PAGE) so that we could follow precursor import and assembly into complexes. The 35S-labeled Bak was initially found in an ∼400-kDa doublet complex at early time points (Fig. 1A, upper panel, lanes 1 and 2, termed BakI), but after prolonged incubation (between 30 and 60 min) at 37 °C, Bak shifted into a lower species of ∼100 kDa (Fig. 1A, upper panel, lanes 3–5, termed BakII). To determine whether 35S-Bak was buried within the BakΙ and BakΙΙ complexes, we performed a protease protection assay following import. Radiolabeled Bak within the BakΙ complex was largely resistant to externally added protease (Fig. 1A, upper panel, lanes 6 and 7) and therefore likely represents membrane-integrated and assembled Bak. SDS-PAGE analysis of protease-treated mitochondria revealed that the radiolabeled Bak was clipped as judged by its faster migration, and at points where Bak had transitioned to the BakΙΙ complex, further digestion was seen resulting in the accumulation of an ∼10-kDa fragment (Fig. 1A, lower panel, compare lane 5 with 10). It has been previously found that activation of Bak results in it undergoing a conformational change and becoming more susceptible to proteolysis (9Wei M.C. Lindsten T. Mootha V.K. Weiler S. Gross A. Ashiya M. Thompson C.B. Korsmeyer S.J. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2060-2071Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Cheng E.H. Sheiko T.V. Fisher J.K. Craigen W.J. Korsmeyer S.J.

Chem. 2003; 278: 25039-25045Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). The change in Bak proteolysis is consistent with either a conformational change in Bak from its inactive to active state, an alteration in how it is buried in the membrane, or a change in the proteins with which it was associated. Different detergents are known to affect the conformation of Bak solubilized from membranes, with digitonin discriminating between active and inactive conformers, although Triton X-100 exposes an epitope in Bak that is also seen in the active form (37Hsu Y.T. Wolter K.G. Youle R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1997; 94: 3668-3672Crossref PubMed Scopus (1032) Google Scholar, 38Dewson G. Kratina T. Sim H.W. Puthalakath H. Adams J.M. Colman P.M. Kluck R.M. Mol. Cell. 2008; 30: 369-380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). It has also been found that when the detergent CHAPS is used in gel filtration studies, inactive Bak resolves at ∼50 kDa (39Ren D. Kim H. Tu H.C. Westergard T.D. Fisher J.K. Rubens J.A. Korsmeyer S.J. Hsieh J.J. Cheng E.H. Sci. Signal. 2009; 2: ra48Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 40Kim H. Tu H.C. Ren D. Takeuchi O. Jeffers J.R. Zambetti G.P. Hsieh J.J. Cheng E.H. Mol. Cell. 2009; 36: 487-499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar). Solubilization of mitochondria in different detergents (digitonin, dodecyl maltoside, Triton X-100, or CHAPS) revealed that the BakΙ complex was only present in digitonin (supplemental Fig. S1). This suggests that the 400-kDa BakΙ complex is quite labile, and Bak-interacting proteins can dissociate in particular detergents. Similar results have been observed with the translocase complex of the mitochondrial outer membrane (41Dekker P.J. Ryan M.T. Brix J. Müller H. Hönlinger A. Pfanner N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6515-6524Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). We next assessed whether the transition of Bak from the BakΙ to BakΙΙ complex correlated with activation of Bak, leading to MOMP and cytochrome c release. Immunoblot analysis revealed release of cytochrome c from mitochondria at the same time as Bak transitioned to the BakΙΙ complex (Fig. 1B, lanes 1–5), indicating that MOMP was occurring. As a control, we probed the blot with polyclonal antibodies against the mitochondrial outer membrane protein Tom40. Upon MOMP, proteinase K became accessible to the intermembrane space, and Tom40 epitopes were subsequently lost (Fig. 1B, lanes 8–10). Our findings are similar to those recently reported by Ross et al. (42Ross K. Rudel T. Kozjak-Pavlovic V. Cell Death Differ. 2009; 16: 697-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar); however, in their case, Bak remained in the BakΙ doublet species and only shifted when cells were induced to undergo apoptosis. To determine whether the transition we observed of Bak from the BakΙ to BakΙΙ complex was the same as the transitioning observed by Ross et al. (42Ross K. Rudel T. Kozjak-Pavlovic V. Cell Death Differ. 2009; 16: 697-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), we induced MOMP in vitro by adding the membrane-targeted death ligand, tBid. We loaded 35S-Bak into isolated HeLa cell mitochondria for 5 min to generate the 400-kDa BakΙ complex and then subsequently added recombinant tBid. Radiolabeled Bak was found predominantly within the 400-kDa inactive BakΙ complex in untreated samples, although addition of tBid caused it to transition into the BakΙΙ complex (Fig. 1C), and cytochrome c release was observed (Fig. 1D). To ensure the changes observed with the in vitro translated 35S-Bak were mirrored by the endogenous form of Bak, isolated HeLa cell mitochondria were incubated with or without tBid, solubilized in digitonin buffer, and analyzed by BN-PAGE and immunoblot analysis with anti-Bak antibodies. As with in vitro translated Bak, endogenous Bak was found in a 400-kDa complex in nonstimulated samples and, upon treatment with tBid, transitioned to the smaller BakΙΙ complex (Fig. 1E). We conclude that transition of Bak from the 400-kDa BakΙ complex into the lower molecular weight BakΙΙ complex correlated with a conformational change in Bak, as indicated by increased susceptibility of Bak to externally added protease, MOMP induction, and cytochrome c release. Of note is that some endogenous (presumably inactive) Bak was also found at a low molecular weight position suggesting that Bak must not be found in the 400-kDa complex to remain inactive and/or the complex is somewhat labile (Fig. 1E). Our results indicate that MOMP can occur in isolated HeLa cell mitochondria under our in vitro import conditions, and this activation mirrors tBid-inducible MOMP through Bak activation. Bak has previously been reported to undergo spontaneous activation following incubation at 43 °C (43Pagliari L.J. Kuwana T. Bonzon C. Newmeyer D.D. Tu S. Beere H.M. Green D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 17975-17980Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). It is possible that prolonged incubation of isolated HeLa cell mitochondria at 37 °C may also induce this activation. Indeed, transition of Bak from BakΙ to the BakΙΙ complex was not observed when the assay was performed at 22 °C (Fig. 2A, lanes 7–12). Next we tested whether activation of MOMP in isolated HeLa cell mitochondria required newly imported Bak. We took isolated HeLa cell mitochondria and incubated them at 37 °C for varying times either alone, in the presence of reticulocyte lysate lacking translated Bak, or with reticulocyte lysate containing translated 35S-Bak. Samples were analyzed by BN-PAGE to monitor Bak transitions and SDS-PAGE to follow cytochrome c release. Incubation of mitochondria alone at 37 °C was sufficient to induce transitioning of endogenous Bak to its active form (Fig. 2B, lanes 14–18), and this correlated with cytochrome c release (Fig. 2C, lanes 1–5). However, in the presence reticulocyte lysate, the BakΙ complex was stable (Fig. 2B, lanes 19–22), and cytochrome c release was blocked (Fig. 2C, lanes 6–9). Conversely, the addition of 35S-Bak in reticulocyte lysate (Fig. 2B, lanes 10–13) induced both Bak transitioning (Fig. 2B, lanes 23–26) and complete release of cytochrome c from mitochondria (Fig. 2C, lanes 10–13). Our results indicate that although isolated HeLa cell mitochondria can undergo spontaneous Bak activation in vitro, this is inhibited when mitochondria are incubated in the presence of rabbit reticulocyte lysate lacking newly translated Bak. This inhibition might be due to the presence of anti-apoptotic proteins such as Bcl-xL in the reticulocyte lysate (43Pagliari L.J. Kuwana T. Bonzon C. Newmeyer D.D. Tu S. Beere H.M. Green D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 17975-17980Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). However, the inhibitory property of the lysate was overcome when the lysate contained newly translated Bak molecules. Indeed, the Western blot analysis showed that the radiolabeled Bak contributed to the overall increased reactivity to Bak antibodies (Fig. 2B, compare lane 14 with 23) indicating that relatively high amounts of Bak were synthesized in the reticulocyte lysate. Thus, the integration of additional Bak molecules into the outer membrane appears to disturb an equilibrium existing between Bak and its regulatory proteins, causing Bak activation and MOMP. We observed that the size of the 400-kDa Bak complex resembled VDAC complexes previously seen by BN-PAGE (42Ross K. Rudel T. Kozjak-Pavlovic V. Cell Death Differ. 2009; 16: 697-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 44Kozjak-Pavlovic V. Ross K. Götz M. Goosmann C. Rudel T. J. Mol.

Pfanner N. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 289-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). To determine whether VDAC2 influenced the formation of the Bak complex, we compared import and assembly of Bak in mitochondria isolated from wild type and vdac2−/− MEFs. In mitochondria from wild type MEFs, radiolabeled Bak integrated into the 400-kDa BakΙ complex, but unlike HeLa cell mitochondria, spontaneous transition into the BakΙΙ complex following extended incubation at 37 °C was not observed. Nevertheless, Bak still transitioned into the smaller complex following addition of tBid (Fig. 3A, lanes 1–6). The transition of Bak from inactive to active form may therefore be dependent on the steady-state levels of other anti-apoptotic proteins in mitochondria. After addition of 35S-Bak to mitochondria isolated from vdac2−/− MEFs, we did not observe the 400-kDa BakΙ complex. Instead, Bak immediately formed the BakΙΙ complex (Fig. 3A, lanes 7–12). To ensure that other large molecular weight assemblies were not affected in vdac2−/− mitochondria, we assessed the import and assembly of a control mitochondrial outer membrane protein, Tom22, which proceeded normally into the TOM complex in mitochondria isolated from vdac2−/− cells (Fig. 3B). Some studies have suggested that rather than influencing the activity of Bak, VDAC2 is needed for recruitment of new Bak molecules to mitochondria (24Setoguchi K. Otera H. Mihara K.

New Caledonian crows consume a range of foods and use sticks as tools to extract wood-boring beetle larvae from their burrows. These larvae, with their unusual diet, have a distinct isotopic signature that can be traced after consumption by the crows in the crows' feathers and blood. By comparing the stable isotope profiles of crows' tissues with those of their food sources, Rutz et al. (p. 1523 ) estimated the proportion of larvae in crow diets, providing a proxy for tool-use dependence in individual crows. Just a few larvae can satisfy a crow's daily energy requirements, highlighting the substantial rewards available to competent tool users and their offspring. Thus, tool use provides New Caledonian crows with access to a very nutritional food source that is not easily exploited by beak alone."

Zot structure-function analysis has mapped this activity to aa 288-293, named AT1002. AT1002 reduced transepithelial electrical resistance across rat small intestine, ex vivo, as did Zot and its processed mature form, ΔG. AT1002 increased in vivo permeability to sugar tracers, whereas scrambled control peptides did not. Binding and barrier assays in proteinase activated receptor (PAR)(2)-expressing and PAR(2)-null cells established AT1002 activity to be PAR(2) dependent. Coincident with the increased intestinal permeability, confocal microscopy of AT1002-exposed rat intestinal IEC6 cells revealed displacement of ZO-1 and occludin from intercellular boundaries. In coimmunoprecipitation assays, AT1002 decreased ZO-1-occludin and ZO-1-claudin 1 interactions coincident with PKCα-dependent ZO-1 serine/threonine phosphorylation. Further, AT1002 increased serine phosphorylation of myosin 1C and, at the same time, transiently diminished its association with ZO-1. The COOH-terminal domain of ZO-1 was required for its association with myosin 1C. These data indicate that the NH(2)-terminal portion of active Zot contains a PAR(2)-activating motif, FCIGRL, that increases PKCα-dependent ZO-1 and myosin 1C serine/threonine phosphorylation. These modifications provoke selective disengagement of ZO-1 from its binding partners, occludin, claudin 1, and myosin 1C, coincident with opening of tjs."

Our results show that genetically obese FXR−/−/ob/ob mice displayed a resistance to rosiglitazone treatment.

The expression of Wnt/β-catenin pathway and target genes was increased in FXR−/− adipose tissue and MEFs.

Early regulators of preadipocyte differentiation are other members of the CAAT/enhancer-binding protein family, C/EBPβ and C/EBPδ (15Wu Z. Bucher N.L. Farmer S.R. Mol. Cell.

Metab. 2009; 20: 107-114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (672) Google Scholar). Among the extracellular signaling pathways that regulate adipogenesis is the Wnt pathway (17Christodoulides C. Lagathu C. Sethi J.K. Vidal-Puig A. Trends Endocrinol.

The non-canonical and canonical Wnt signaling pathways, being respectively β-catenin-independent and -dependent, are negative regulators of adipogenesis (17Christodoulides C. Lagathu C. Sethi J.K. Vidal-Puig A. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 2009; 20: 16-24Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar). In the absence of Wnt proteins, β-catenin is localized in the cytoplasm in a protein complex containing Axin and adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) proteins, which facilitate β-catenin phosphorylation and its subsequent proteasomal degradation (18Logan C.Y. Nusse R. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2004; 20: 781-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (4276) Google Scholar). The binding of Wnt proteins to their receptors Frizzled (FZD) and low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein-5 or -6 (LRP5/6) leads to β-catenin protein stabilization. Hypophosphorylated β-catenin protein translocates into the nucleus and activates its target genes (19Angers S. Moon R.T. Nat. Rev. Mol.

We show that obese FXR−/−/ob/ob mice displayed an altered response to PPARγ activation by rosiglitazone. Retroviral re-expression of FXR in FXR−/− MEFs restored the adipogenic gene expression program in response to rosiglitazone. The delay in adipogenic differentiation in FXR−/− MEFs was associated with a sustained activation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling. All these results provide evidence for a crucial role of FXR in adipogenesis by promoting the PPARγ pathway and interfering with Wnt/β-catenin signaling. Female and male ob/ob mice (B6.V-Lepob/J) from Charles River (Saint Aubin les Elseuf, France) were crossed with FXR+/+ and FXR−/− C57BL6/J mice to obtain FXR+/+/ob/ob and FXR−/−/ob/ob mice. 12-week-old FXR−/−/ob/ob female mice and their wild type littermates (n = 7/group) were housed on a 12-h light/12-h dark cycle with free access to water and were treated with the PPARγ agonist rosiglitazone (Avandia®, GlaxoSmithKline) (10 mg/kg of body weight) mixed with control diet (UAR A03, Villemoison/Orge, France) for 21 days. MEFs were derived from 13.5-day-old FXR+/+ and FXR−/− embryos (C57BL6/N) (7Cariou B. van Harmelen K. Duran-Sandoval D. van Dijk T.H. Grefhorst A. Abdelkarim M. Caron S. Torpier G. Fruchart J.C.

Adipocyte differentiation was initiated 2 days after confluence with AmnioMAX-C100 medium (Invitrogen), 7.5% AmnioMAX-C100 supplement, 7.5% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 0.5 mm 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, 1 μm dexamethasone, 5 μg/ml insulin. From days 3–8, cells were incubated with AmnioMAX-C100 medium with 5 μg/ml insulin and 1 μm rosiglitazone. At days 0, 4, and 8, cells were used for lipid metabolism studies (lipolysis, de novo lipogenesis, and triglyceride content), lysed and homogenized for RNA isolation, or fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and stained with Oil Red O. All experiments were performed in triplicate. Preadipocytes were isolated from inguinal fat pads of 20-week-old FXR−/−/ob/ob and their FXR+/+/ob/ob littermates. Adipose tissue was isolated, dissociated mechanically, and digested in Krebs buffer solution (118 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1.25 mm CaCl2, 1.2 mm KH2PO4, 1.2 mm MgSO4, 20 mm NaHCO3, 2 mm sodium pyruvate, 10 mm HEPES, 3% BSA, pH 7.4) containing 1.5 mg/ml collagenase A (Roche Diagnostics GmbH, Mannheim, Germany) for 1.5 h in a shaking water bath at 37 °C. After digestion, the mature adipocytes were separated from the stroma-vascular cells by centrifugation. The stroma-vascular pellet containing the preadipocytes was treated with erythrocyte lysis solution (154 mmol/liter NH4Cl, 10 mmol/liter KHCO3, 0.1 mmol/liter EDTA) for 5 min at room temperature and centrifuged. The preadipocyte-containing pellet was cultured in PromoCell® preadipocyte growth medium (PromoCell GmbH, Heidelberg, Germany) at 37 °C in a humidified 95% air and 5% CO2 incubator. Cultures were grown to confluence (days (−2)). Two days after confluence (day 0), the medium was changed to preadipocyte differentiation medium supplemented with 8 μg/ml d-biotin-4, 0.5 μg/ml bovine insulin, 400 ng/ml dexamethasone, 44 μg/ml 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, 9 ng/ml l-thyroxine. From days 3–8, the medium was changed to adipocyte nutrition medium and was supplemented with rosiglitazone (1 μm). At days 0, 4, and 8, cells were lysed and homogenized for RNA isolation or fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and stained with Oil Red O. Cellular lipids were extracted with hexane/isopropyl alcohol (3:2 v/v). Lipids were then dried with nitrogen gas, redissolved in isopropyl alcohol, and quantified using the TG PAP 1000 kit (BioMérieux, Marcy l'Etoile, France). Lipolysis experiments were performed at days 4 and 8 of MEF differentiation. Cells were washed with PBS and incubated with 300 μl of incubation solution (adipolysis assay kit, OB100, Millipore) with 2% BSA or containing 10 μm isoproterenol for 3 h. Glycerol was measured in the culture supernatant with free glycerol assay reagent (adipolysis assay kit, OB100, Millipore). Glycerol concentrations were normalized to total cellular protein content. All experiments were performed in triplicate. De novo lipogenesis was evaluated by measuring incorporation of radiolabeled acetate precursor into total cellular lipids. Cells were washed and incubated with compounds for 48 h in culture medium without FBS and with 3 mg/ml BSA. Cells were then washed and incubated in Krebs-Ringer buffer for 90 min in the presence of 1 μCi of [14C]acetate (Amersham Biosciences, Saclay, France). MEFs were washed, and total cellular lipids were extracted twice with hexane/isopropyl alcohol. The pooled organic fractions were transferred to scintillation vials, dried under nitrogen, and assessed for radioactivity by liquid scintillation counting. [14C]Acetate incorporation was normalized to total cellular protein content. Total RNA was isolated from white adipose tissue using the acid guanidinium thiocyanate/phenol/chloroform method and from MEFs and differentiated preadipocytes using the TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) and subsequently reverse-transcribed using Moloney murine leukemia virus (Applied Biosystems, Paris, France). cDNAs were quantified by quantitative PCR on a Mx4000 apparatus (Stratagene) using specific primers (supplemental Table 2). mRNA levels were subsequently normalized to those of cyclophilin. ΔCt was calculated as the difference between the Ct of the gene of interest and that of cyclophilin. The retrovirus was constructed using the FXRα3 mouse cDNA. The sequences of the primers used were: 5′-atacgcggatccatggtgatgagtttcaggg-3′ and 5′-ctctagaccctacacgtcactcagctgcgcata-3′ (the initiation (atg) and stop (tag) codons are underlined). The FXR coding sequence was cloned into the mammalian expression vector pBabe-Puro (Invitrogen) in BamHI and SalI sites. Human embryonic kidney 293T modified packaging cells (Ecotropic Phoenix) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 10% FBS and transiently transfected with a pBabe-puro-FXR chimera or a pBabe-puro vector alone as negative control. 48 h after transfection, the viral supernatant was harvested and used to infect the MEFs. Selection of MEFs that had incorporated the retrovirus was done by adding puromycin to the medium for 1 week. FXR expression was measured by quantitative PCR. Recombinant human secreted Frizzled-related protein (sFRP) 1 was purchased from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). FXR−/− MEFs were differentiated in the presence or absence of recombinant sFRP1 (75 nmol/liter) added at day 0. Total cellular MEF protein was extracted using a radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 1.0% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 0.5% (w/v) sodium deoxycholate, 1.0 mm EDTA, 0.1% (w/v) SDS, and 0.01% (w/v) sodium azide, pH:7.4). Protein concentration was determined by the Bradford method (Bio-Rad protein assay). Protein samples were denatured by heating to 90 °C in SDS-reducing buffer and resolved by electrophoresis on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. After protein transfer, nitrocellulose membranes were incubated with a mouse monoclonal anti-β-catenin antibody (catalog number 610153, BD Transduction Laboratories) for 3 h and HRP-conjugated secondary antibody (Dako A/S, Glostrup, Denmark) for 1 h. Proteins were then visualized by chemiluminescence using an ECL detection kit (Amersham Biosciences, Orsay, France). Inguinal adipose tissue was fixed in 4% neutral buffered paraformaldehyde, embedded in paraffin, cut into 7-μm sections, and stained with hematoxylin. Cell size was determined using the ImageJ software (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, rsb.info.nih.gov/ij). Total RNA was prepared from epididymal adipose tissue of FXR+/+ and FXR−/− mice, and the subsequent steps were performed as described elsewhere (25Slonim D.K. Koide K. Johnson K.L. Tantravahi U. Cowan J.M. Jarrah Z. Bianchi D.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 9425-9429Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Affymetrix raw data were normalized using the robust multiarray average (RMA) algorithm to obtain expression values in log2 (26Irizarry R.A. Bolstad B.M. Collin F. Cope L.M. Hobbs B. Speed T.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: e15Crossref PubMed Scopus (4034) Google Scholar). Log2-transformed expression values were fitted to a linear model according to Limma package methods (Biocoundctor). A model was established to identify probesets significantly differentially expressed between FXR+/+ and FXR−/− mice. False discovery rate correction was applied to take into account multiple testing hypotheses. Selection of relevant probe sets was based on a mean log2 expression value greater than 6.12 in a least one of the two compared conditions, a p value <10−5, and an absolute -fold change value of 1.5. Function of all clustering of regulated genes was performed by Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (Ingenuity). Statistical significance was analyzed using the unpaired Student's t test. All values are reported as means ± S.D. Values with p < 0.05 were considered significant. To explore whether the FXR and PPARγ pathways interact in vivo, genetically obese (ob/ob) FXR−/− and FXR+/+ mice were treated with rosiglitazone (10 mg/kg of body weight) for 21 days. As a positive control of in vivo PPARγ activation (27Lazarenko O.P. Rzonca S.O. Hogue W.R. Swain F.L. Suva L.J. Lecka-Czernik B.

Interestingly, although PPARγ activation by rosiglitazone led to the appearance of a subpopulation of smaller adipocytes in white adipose tissue of FXR+/+ mice, likely due to the induction of preadipocyte recruitment (29Yamauchi T. Kamon J. Waki H. Terauchi Y. Kubota N. Hara K. Mori Y. Ide T. Murakami K. Tsuboyama-Kasaoka N. Ezaki O. Akanuma Y. Gavrilova O. Vinson C. Reitman M.L. Kagechika H. Shudo K. Yoda M. Nakano Y. Tobe K.

Moreover, the induction of some PPARγ target genes such as adiponectin and lipoprotein lipase (LPL) by rosiglitazone was abolished in adipose tissue from FXR−/− when compared with FXR+/+ mice (Fig. 2A). Although the induction of other PPARγ target genes (cd36 and aP2) was also reduced in FXR−/− mice, the expression of adipogenic genes, such as C/EBPα and C/EBPβ, was induced to the same level in both genotypes, and PPARγ expression itself was not modified (Fig. 2B). Most interestingly, the induction of genes involved in lipid droplet formation, such as perilipin, adipose differentiation-related protein (ADRP), and fsp27, by rosiglitazone was totally abolished in FXR−/− when compared with FXR+/+ mice, whereas s3-12 expression was not affected (Fig. 2C). These data demonstrate that FXR is necessary to ensure the full response to PPARγ activation in adipose tissue.FIGURE 2FXR deficiency alters the expression profile of white adipose tissue genes following rosiglitazone treatment.

Upon PPARγ activation, the induction of C/EBPα, PPARγ, and aP2 following rosiglitazone treatment was drastically reduced at day 4, and to a lesser extent at day 8, in FXR−/− when compared with FXR+/+ MEFs (Fig. 3). These results show that FXR−/− MEFs are resistant to PPARγ activation, which is unable to induce the complete adipogenic differentiation program in these cells. The functional consequences of the resistance to PPARγ activation was studied by comparing the phenotype of FXR−/− and FXR+/+ MEFs differentiated in the presence of rosiglitazone. The increase in TG content at day 8 of differentiation was significantly lower in FXR−/− MEFs when compared with FXR+/+ MEFs (Fig. 4A). This reduction in TG content can be the consequence of either an increase in TG degradation (lipolysis) and/or a decrease in TG synthesis (lipogenesis). Therefore, basal and β-adrenergically (isoproterenol)-induced lipolysis was assessed by measuring glycerol release into the cell culture medium. Rosiglitazone-treated FXR−/− MEFs displayed an enhanced lipolysis when compared with FXR+/+ MEFs under both basal conditions and after β-adrenergic stimulation (Fig. 4A), which was statistically significant at day 4 of differentiation. Analysis of [14C]acetate incorporation demonstrated a significant decrease of fatty acid synthesis (de novo lipogenesis) in rosiglitazone-treated FXR−/− when compared with FXR+/+ MEFs at days 4 and 8 of differentiation (Fig. 4A). Moreover, PPARγ-activated FXR−/− MEFs also exhibited an abnormal morphology with lipid droplets of smaller size (Fig. 4B). Accordingly, rosiglitazone-treated FXR−/− MEFs showed decreased expression of several lipid droplet genes at day 4,"

Here, the authors conceptualize the neuron's efferent synapses as estimating the membrane potential trajectory from the spikes. They find that short-term changes in synaptic efficacy can be interpreted as implementing an optimal estimator. The trajectory of the somatic membrane potential of a cortical neuron exactly reflects the computations performed on its afferent inputs. However, the spikes of such a neuron are a very low-dimensional and discrete projection of this continually evolving signal. We explored the possibility that the neuron′s efferent synapses perform the critical computational step of estimating the membrane potential trajectory from the spikes. We found that short-term changes in synaptic efficacy can be interpreted as implementing an optimal estimator of this trajectory. Short-term depression arose when presynaptic spiking was sufficiently intense as to reduce the uncertainty associated with the estimate; short-term facilitation reflected structural features of the statistics of the presynaptic neuron such as up and down states. Our analysis provides a unifying account of a powerful, but puzzling, form of plasticity."
https://openalex.org/W2060382254,"We report herein a critical role for the stringent response regulatory DnaK suppressor protein (DksA) in the coordination of antioxidant defenses. DksA helps fine-tune the expression of glutathione biosynthetic genes and discrete steps in the pentose phosphate pathway and tricarboxylic acid cycle that are associated with the generation of reducing power. Control of NAD(P)H/NAD(P)(+) redox balance by DksA fuels downstream antioxidant enzymatic systems in nutritionally starving Salmonella. Conditional expression of the glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase-encoding gene zwf, shown here to be under DksA control, increases both the NADPH pool and antioxidant defenses of dksA mutant Salmonella. The DksA-mediated coordination of redox balance boosts the antioxidant defenses of stationary phase bacteria. Not only does DksA increase resistance of Salmonella against hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)), but it also promotes fitness of this intracellular pathogen when exposed to oxyradicals produced by the NADPH phagocyte oxidase in an acute model of infection. Given the role of DksA in the adjustment of gene expression in most bacteria undergoing nutritional deprivation, our findings raise the possibility that the control of central metabolic pathways by this regulatory protein maintains redox homeostasis essential for antioxidant defenses in phylogenetically diverse bacterial species."
https://openalex.org/W2032061673,"Many biological motor molecules move within cells using stepsizes predictable from their structures. Myosin VI, however, has much larger and more broadly distributed stepsizes than those predicted from its short lever arms. We explain the discrepancy by monitoring Qdots and gold nanoparticles attached to the myosin-VI motor domains using high-sensitivity nanoimaging. The large stepsizes were attributed to an extended and relatively rigid lever arm; their variability to two stepsizes, one large (72 nm) and one small (44 nm). These results suggest that there exist two tilt angles during myosin-VI stepping, which correspond to the pre- and postpowerstroke states and regulate the leading head. The large steps are consistent with the previously reported hand-over-hand mechanism, while the small steps follow an inchworm-like mechanism and increase in frequency with ADP. Switching between these two mechanisms in a strain-sensitive, ADP-dependent manner allows myosin VI to fulfill its multiple cellular tasks including vesicle transport and membrane anchoring."

https://openalex.org/W1980516976,"In the Saccharomyces cerevisiae pheromone-response pathway, the transcription factor Ste12 is inhibited by two mitogen-activated protein (MAP)-kinase-responsive regulators, Dig1 and Dig2. These two related proteins bind to distinct regions of Ste12 but are redundant in their inhibition of Ste12-dependent gene expression. Here we describe three functions for Dig1 that are non-redundant with those of Dig2. First, the removal of Dig1 results in a specific increase in intrinsic and extrinsic noise in the transcriptional outputs of the mating pathway. Second, in dig1Δ cells, Ste12 relocalizes from the nucleoplasmic distribution seen in wild-type cells into discrete subnuclear foci. Third, genome-wide insertional chromatin immunoprecipitation studies revealed that Ste12-dependent genes have increased interchromosomal interactions in dig1Δ cells. These findings suggest that the regulation of gene expression through long-range gene interactions, a widely observed phenomenon, comes at the cost of increased noise. Consequently, cells may have evolved mechanisms to suppress noise by controlling these interactions."

Compared to mononuclear cells, the CD34+ fraction was superior in its expansion of functional EPCs that could differentiate into acLDL/UEA-1+ cells without significant cellular senescence, whereas the CD34- fraction showed no EPC expansion. Among the cytokine combinations tested for the CD34+ fraction, a combination (SFIb) consisting of stem cell factor (SCF), FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 ligand, interleukin-3, and basic fibroblast growth factor resulted in a reproducible 64- to 1468-fold EPC expansion from various cord blood origins. Interestingly, the SFIb combination displayed markedly increased EPC expansion (2.43-fold), with a higher percentage of CD34+ cells (2.17-fold), undifferentiated blasts (2.38-fold) and CXCR4+ cells (1.68-fold) compared to another cytokine combination (SCF, thrombopoietin, and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor), although the two cytokine combinations had a similar level of total mononucleated cell expansion (~10% difference). Accordingly, the cells expanded in the SFIb combination were more effective in recovery of blood flow and neovascularization in hind-limb ischemia in vivo. Taken together, these results suggest that the nonadhesive serum-free culture conditions of the CD34+ fraction provide an effective EPC expansion method for cell therapy, and an expansion condition leading to high percentages of CD34+ cells and blasts is likely important in EPC expansion.—O, E., Lee, B.

https://openalex.org/W2052145332,"We present evidence for a coupled two-step action of Hedgehog signaling in patterning axon targeting of Drosophila olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs). In the first step, differential Hedgehog pathway activity in peripheral sensory organ precursors creates ORN populations with different levels of the Patched receptor. Different Patched levels in ORNs then determine axonal responsiveness to target-derived Hedgehog in the brain: only ORN axons that do not express high levels of Patched are responsive to and require a second step of Hedgehog signaling for target selection. Hedgehog signaling in the imaginal sensory organ precursors thus confers differential ORN responsiveness to Hedgehog-mediated axon targeting in the brain. This mechanism contributes to the spatial coordination of ORN cell bodies in the periphery and their glomerular targets in the brain. Such coupled two-step signaling may be more generally used to coordinate other spatially and temporally segregated developmental events.

Peripheral hedgehog signaling creates olfactory neurons with different Patched levels Olfactory axons reuse Hedgehog, produced by the central brain, for target selection Only axons with low levels of Patched are responsive to the second round of signaling This mechanism coordinates peripheral cell-body positions with central axon targets From insects to mammals, olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs) expressing a given odorant receptor project their axons to a common glomerulus, thereby creating a spatial map for odor processing (Ressler et al., 1994Ressler K.J.

Although ORNs that express a given receptor are distributed widely across the olfactory epithelium, there is a certain degree of spatial correspondence between ORN cell bodies in the periphery and their glomerular targets in the brain. In mice, there is a coarse topographic correspondence of ORNs along the dorsomedial-ventrolateral axis in the nasal epithelium and their glomerular targets along the dorsal-ventral axis of the olfactory bulb (Miyamichi et al., 2005Miyamichi K. Serizawa S. Kimura H.M. Sakano H.

Neurosci. 2005; 25: 3586-3592Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Axon-axon interactions via Semaphorin-3F and its receptors contribute to the establishment of this topography (Takeuchi et al., 2010Takeuchi H. Inokuchi K. Aoki M. Suto F. Tsuboi A. Matsuda I. Suzuki M. Aiba A. Serizawa S.

In flies, ORNs belonging to distinct types of sensillae target their axons to different coarse domains in the antennal lobe (Couto et al., 2005Couto A. Alenius M. Dickson B.J. Molecular, anatomical, and functional organization of the Drosophila olfactory system.Curr. Biol. 2005; 15: 1535-1547Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar). Here, we show that Hedgehog signaling acts via a coupled two-step mechanism to contribute to this spatial coordination in Drosophila. The Hedgehog (Hh) protein acts by binding to and inactivating the Patched (Ptc) receptor, relieving Ptc inhibition of the 7-transmembrane protein Smoothened (Smo). Active Smo transduces the Hh signal to the transcription factor Cubitus interruptus (Ci), which activates transcription of Hh target genes including ptc itself (Hooper and Scott, 2005Hooper J.E. Scott M.P. Communicating with Hedgehogs.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 6: 306-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar) (Figure 1A ). In the Drosophila wing disc, Hh is produced and secreted from the posterior compartment, and induces high-level Ptc expression at the anterior-posterior compartment boundary. High Ptc at the boundary in turn sequesters and prevents most of Hh from moving more anteriorly. Meanwhile, in the posterior compartment, the transcription factor Engrailed (En) represses ci expression, thus accounting for the lack of Ptc expression in the posterior compartment despite the presence of Hh. The consequence of this Hh signaling loop establishes different Ptc expression levels in different compartments (Hooper and Scott, 2005Hooper J.E. Scott M.P. Communicating with Hedgehogs.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 6: 306-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar). The transmembrane proteins Interference hedgehog (Ihog) and Brother of Ihog (Boi) function with Ptc as essential coreceptors involved in binding to and transduction of the Hh signal (Yao et al., 2006Yao S.

In addition to this canonical pathway resulting in the regulation of transcription for developmental patterning, a vertebrate Hedgehog homolog, Sonic Hedgehog (Shh), has also been proposed to act as an axon guidance molecule for spinal commissural neurons (Charron et al., 2003Charron F. Stein E. Jeong J. McMahon A.P. Tessier-Lavigne M.

Sonic hedgehog guides axons through a noncanonical, Src-family-kinase-dependent signaling pathway.Neuron. 2009; 62: 349-362Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). It is unclear whether axon guidance function for Hh signaling is a vertebrate innovation or reflects an evolutionarily conserved function. During our studies of Drosophila olfactory system development, we uncovered a mechanism whereby Hh signaling is used in two distinct but coupled steps. We found that Hh signaling in the larval antennal disc and early pupal antenna creates two populations of ORNs with different Ptc levels. Smo and Ihog are cell-autonomously required in only a subset of ORN classes for their axon targeting. Surprisingly, only low-Ptc ORNs require Smo and Ihog; high-Ptc ORNs do not require Smo and Ihog for their axon targeting. Further genetic analyses, including tissue-specific and temporally regulated loss- and gain-of-function studies of several Hh pathway components, strongly support a coupled two-step model: early Hh signaling in the sensory organ precursors confers differential ORN responsiveness to Hh in the brain, such that only axons of low-Ptc ORN classes respond to later signaling by brain-derived Hh. This coupled two-step mechanism contributes to the spatial coordination of ORN cell bodies in the periphery and their axon targets in the brain, and suggests a general paradigm for coordinating spatially and temporally segregated developmental events. Drosophila ORNs reside in the third antennal segment and in the maxillary palp (Stocker, 2001Stocker R.F. Drosophila as a focus in olfactory research: mapping of olfactory sensilla by fine structure, odor specificity, odorant receptor expression, and central connectivity.Microsc. Res. Tech. 2001; 55: 284-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Both structures derive from the larval antennal disc (Figure 1B). We find that Hedgehog (Hh) signaling patterns the larval antennal disc along the anterior-posterior axis. In late third instar larvae, Hh protein is enriched in the posterior compartment of the antennal disc (Figures 1B and 1E), consistent with a previous study based on expression of the hh-lacZ enhancer trap (Lee et al., 1992Lee J.J. von Kessler D.P. Parks S. Beachy P.A. Secretion and localized transcription suggest a role in positional signaling for products of the segmentation gene hedgehog.Cell. 1992; 71: 33-50Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). The level of Ptc protein is highest at the compartment border and moderate in the anterior compartment (Figures 1C and 1F). Ptc staining in the posterior compartment is indistinguishable from background within clones of cells homozygous for a ptc null mutant (Figure 1F), suggesting that the posterior compartment produces either no Ptc or Ptc at a level below the threshold of antibody detection. Smo protein is ubiquitously produced, but higher levels are detected in the posterior compartment (Figures 1D and 1G). In addition, En and Ci proteins are distributed in the posterior and anterior compartments, respectively (data not shown; see Figure 3C), consistent with previous data utilizing en-lacZ or ci in situ hybridization (Eaton and Kornberg, 1990Eaton S. Kornberg T.B. Repression of ci-D in posterior compartments of Drosophila by engrailed.Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 1068-1077Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). To test whether Hh signaling is necessary for Ptc expression, we generated clones of cells homozygous for a smo null mutation (Figure 1G), and found that Ptc expression in the anterior compartment is markedly reduced in smo clones (Figure 1H). These expression patterns, together with the smo loss-of-function effect on Ptc expression, indicate that antennal disc patterning by the Hh pathway is governed by similar mechanisms as the well-examined wing disc (Hooper and Scott, 2005Hooper J.E. Scott M.P. Communicating with Hedgehogs.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 6: 306-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar): cells in the posterior compartment produce Hh and cells in the anterior compartment can respond to Hh. In the wing disc, however, Hh-induced Ptc expression occurs predominantly at the anterior-posterior border (Capdevila et al., 1994Capdevila J. Estrada M.P. Sanchez-Herrero E. Guerrero I. The Drosophila segment polarity gene patched interacts with decapentaplegic in wing development.EMBO J. 1994; 13: 71-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, Chen and Struhl, 1996Chen Y. Struhl G. Dual roles for patched in sequestering and transducing Hedgehog.Cell. 1996; 87: 553-563Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (728) Google Scholar), whereas in the antennal disc, signaling by Hh extends into the entire anterior compartment, as seen by elevated Ptc levels (Figure 1C) that are dependent on Smo (Figure 1H2, arrowhead). This difference may reflect the fact that the antennal disc is much smaller than the wing disc, thus allowing Hh signaling to occur throughout the anterior compartment including the imaginal precursors of the third antennal segment that give rise to ORNs. During the first 36 hr after puparium formation (APF), the antennae and maxillary palps undergo extensive morphogenetic movements. ORNs are born and pioneer ORN axons from the antennae and maxillary palps reach the antennal lobe at 18 hr and 32 hr APF, respectively (Jhaveri et al., 2000Jhaveri D. Sen A. Rodrigues V.

Despite the morphogenetic movements and ORN neurogenesis, the early spatial segregation of cells expressing high levels of Ptc or Hh persists in pupal antennae and maxillary palps (Figures 1I and 1J and Figures S1A and S1B available online), eventually encompassing most ORNs. This is likely a result of continuous Hh signaling between the posterior and anterior compartments during early pupal development (see below). For simplicity, we refer hereafter to these two populations of pupal ORNs as producing high levels of Ptc (high-Ptc) and low levels of Ptc (low-Ptc), although low-Ptc cells may produce no Ptc and high Ptc cells may produce differing amounts of Ptc. Both Ptc and Smo proteins are also present on the ORN axons leaving the antenna as well as the ORN axon layer at the developing antennal lobe (Figures S1C–S1F, S1H, and S1I). These expression studies suggest that Hh signaling is likely involved in ORN development and axon targeting. To examine the requirement for Hh signaling in ORN axon targeting, we performed mosaic analysis (Figure 2A ) utilizing a smo protein null allele (Figure 1G). First, we used ey-FLP to produce homozygous mutant clones in the sensory organs but not in the brain (Newsome et al., 2000Newsome T.P. Asling B. Dickson B.J.

Axonal targeting of olfactory receptor neurons in Drosophila is controlled by Dscam.Neuron. 2003; 37: 221-231Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). We detected mutant clones with the MARCM method (Lee and Luo, 1999Lee T. Luo L. Mosaic analysis with a repressible cell marker for studies of gene function in neuronal morphogenesis.Neuron. 1999; 22: 451-461Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1883) Google Scholar), and labeled specific classes of ORNs and their axons with the membrane marker UAS-mCD8GFP coupled to different odorant receptor (OR) promoters driving expression of Gal4 (Or-Gal4). Under these experimental conditions (Figure 2A, top), a large fraction of ORNs are homozygous mutant for smo, but Gal4 expression and labeling by mCD8GFP is limited to those mutant ORNs that express the particular Or-Gal4. Since Hh is required for proliferation during early development (Cho et al., 2000Cho K.O. Chern J. Izaddoost S. Choi K.W.

We therefore only analyzed flies with grossly normal antennae and maxillary palps, and brains with ORN axon innervation. Of the 19 ORN classes examined, nine exhibit notable targeting defects when compared with controls (Table 1, Figure 2B, and Table S1; see also Figure S2 for scoring criteria). In addition to innervating the appropriate glomeruli, smo mutant ORN axons mistarget to additional glomeruli or are stalled between glomeruli (arrowheads in Figure 2B and Table S1). The remaining 10 classes exhibit largely normal targeting (Table 1, Figure 2B, and Table S1).Table 1Summary of Axon Targeting of 21 ORN Classes in ey-FLP- or hs-FLP-Induced Control, smo, ihog, or ptc ClonesORN ClassGlomerular target(s)ey-FLP WT(40A)ey-FLP smo3ey-FLP ihoghs-FLP WT(40A)hs-FLP smo3hs-FLP ihoghs-FLP WT(42D)hs-FLP ptcIIWOr10aDL18% (24)8% (26)6% (16)not determined (ND)ND17% (24)83% (24)Or22aDM20% (20)4% (24)0% (23)NDNDND7% (29)18% (34)Or23aDA3 (DC3)5% (21)0% (28)7% (15)0% (9)0% (14)ND6% (34)25% (24)Or47bVA1l/m0% (21)0% (20)0% (22)0% (12)0% (8)ND4% (25)33% (33)Or67bVA314% (21)5% (22)5% (22)NDNDND3% (34)28% (39)Gr21aV9% (22)0% (25)0% (23)NDNDND6% (33)26% (34)Or42aVM7 (V, VL2p)4% (24)7% (28)0% (20)13% (16)4% (23)ND10% (20)6% (18)Or47aDM35% (21)3% (29)0% (29)14% (14)0% (12)ND0% (20)5% (20)Or71aVC26% (17)n.i.

To test whether Smo acts cell autonomously, we made smaller MARCM clones, including single-cell clones, utilizing hs-FLP to induce recombination in late third-instar larvae (Figure 2A, bottom). We found targeting defects in 7 of the 9 ORN classes that exhibit defects in ey-FLP clones (Table 1, Figure 2B and Table S1). In general there is a lower penetrance of hs-FLP induced smo phenotypes compared with ey-FLP; this likely reflects the perdurance of residual wild-type smo mRNA or Smo protein in smaller mutant clones. In addition, we recovered labeled axons in two additional maxillary palp ORNs, and found targeting defects for one, Or46a, but not the other, Or71a. In summary, these genetic mosaic experiments indicate that a subset of ORN classes examined (10/21; bottom rows in Table 1) require Smo, most likely cell autonomously, for axon targeting. Targeting of the remaining 11/21 ORN classes tested does not require Smo. The class-specific requirement of ORN axon targeting for Smo also extends to Ihog, the coreceptor for Hh (Yao et al., 2006Yao S. Lum L. Beachy P. The ihog cell-surface proteins bind Hedgehog and mediate pathway activation.Cell. 2006; 125: 343-357Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, Zheng et al., 2010Zheng X. Mann R.K. Sever N. Beachy P.A. Genetic and biochemical definition of the Hedgehog receptor.Genes Dev. 2010; 24: 57-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Both Ihog and Boi are expressed in the larval antennal disc, but only Ihog is expressed in pupal ORNs (Figures S1J–S1P). We therefore tested the requirement for Ihog in ORN axon targeting utilizing MARCM analyses (Figure 2A), with a null allele of ihog that eliminates Ihog protein (Figure S1K). Unlike smo mutant clones, eyFLP-induced ihog MARCM clones do not create grossly defective antennae and maxillary palps, nor antennal lobes lacking labeled ORN axons. This is likely due to redundancy between Ihog and Boi in larval disc development (Zheng et al., 2010Zheng X. Mann R.K. Sever N. Beachy P.A. Genetic and biochemical definition of the Hedgehog receptor.Genes Dev. 2010; 24: 57-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). However, ihog−/− ORN axons exhibit similar targeting defects to those of smo−/− ORN axons (Figure 2B and Table S1). Moreover, the ORN class-specificity of Ihog dependence matches well with that of Smo dependence (Table 1). We further created hsFLP-induced small clones in 9 ORN classes that require Smo for axon targeting and observed similar ORN axon mistargeting in most classes, although again at a lower penetrance likely due to perdurance as in small smo clones (Table 1 and Table S1). Together, these results suggest that Hh signaling is cell-autonomously required for axon targeting of only a subset of ORN classes. We have thus far described two observations: (1) Only a subset of ORNs require Smo and Ihog for axon targeting, and (2) Hh signaling in the periphery creates population of cells in the antenna and maxillary palp with different Ptc levels. These observations raise the possibility of a relationship between Ptc levels and Smo-dependence as defined by axon targeting in different ORN classes. We determined ORN classes that express high and low Ptc using two experiments. First, we used ptc-Gal4 and en-Gal4 to label ORNs that are derived from anterior and posterior compartments, respectively (Figures 3A and 3C ). We examined their axon projections at 50 hr APF, when stereotypic glomerular structure is first evident. We found that mCD8GFP driven from these two Gal4 lines labels complementary sets of glomeruli (Figures 3A and 3B). Second, based on the correspondence of glomerular identity and OR classes (Couto et al., 2005Couto A. Alenius M. Dickson B.J.

IntroductionAntioxidant enzymes play a decisive role in rapidly growing organisms, including tumor cells and pathogens. Upon a malaria infection, the protozoan parasite Plasmodium continuously multiplies inside host erythrocytes. This specialized lifestyle necessitates the safe management of high oxygen tension. Moreover Plasmodium is under constant exposure to oxidative and nitrosative stress, either generated endogenously by the high metabolic rate or produced exogenously by immune effector cells of the host in response to parasite infection (1Becker K. Koncarevic S. Hunt N.H. Sherman I.W. Molecular Approaches to Malaria. American Society of Microbiology, Washington D. C.2005: 365-383Google Scholar, 2Müller S. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 53: 1291-1305Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). Reactive oxygen species (ROS) 4The abbreviations used are: ROSreactive oxygen speciesGRglutathione reductaseGSHglutathioneMBmethylene blueTrxthioredoxinTrxRthioredoxin reductaseRiboRribonucleotide reductaseTRAPthrombospondin-related anonymous protein. include the superoxide anion (O2·−) formed by univalent reduction of oxygen and the hydroxyl radical (OH•), which can be generated from hydrogen peroxide and the superoxide anion in the presence of iron ions. An imbalance between production and detoxification of these reactive intermediates can lead to local oxidative stress and ultimately damage vital molecules, such as proteins, lipids, or DNA.To maintain and defend their reducing intracellular milieu, numerous organisms including malaria parasites have evolved a dual antioxidative system based on the cysteine-containing redox-active peptides glutathione (GSH) and thioredoxin (Trx) (1Becker K. Koncarevic S. Hunt N.H. Sherman I.W. Molecular Approaches to Malaria. American Society of Microbiology, Washington D. C.2005: 365-383Google Scholar, 2Müller S. Mol.

Parasitol. 2004; 34: 163-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). It should be noted that this dual system also provides the reducing equivalents for converting nucleotides to deoxyribonucleotides, an essential process for DNA synthesis and rapid cell proliferation. Glutathione is the major low molecular weight antioxidant in Plasmodium parasites (4Becker K. Rahlfs S. Nickel C. Schirmer R.H. Biol. Chem. 2003; 384: 551-566PubMed Google Scholar), and it is kept at a high level in the reduced state by the antioxidant enzyme glutathione reductase (GR) (5Schirmer R.H. Bauer H. Becker K. Creighton T.E. Wiley Encyclopedia of Molecular Medicine. John Wiley and Sons, New York, NY2002: 1471-1476Google Scholar), which uses NADPH regenerated in the pentose phosphate pathway as an electron donor. In addition, a complete Trx system, consisting of NADPH, thioredoxin reductase (TrxR), Trx, and a number of Trx-dependent peroxidases, has been characterized in Plasmodium (6Kanzok S.M. Schirmer R.H. Turbachova I. Iozef R. Becker K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40180-40186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar, 7Krnajski Z. Gilberger T.W. Walter R.D. Müller S. Mol.

Redox Signal. 2006; 8: 1227-1239Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Curiously, the malarial and related apicomplexan parasites lack catalase and a classical, selenium-containing glutathione peroxidase, two central antioxidant enzymes present in a wide range of organisms to protect themselves against hydrogen peroxide. In kinetoplastid parasites, the thioredoxin and glutathione systems are replaced by a unique redox system based on trypanothione (9Fairlamb A.H. Cerami A. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1992; 46: 695-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (684) Google Scholar, 10Krauth-Siegel R.L. Meiering S.K. Schmidt H. Biol. Chem. 2003; 384: 539-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar).The apparent deficiency of such a unique antioxidant defense system in Plasmodium further underscores the central importance of the two antioxidant pathways, represented by GR and TrxR, in the parasite. Therefore, the redox metabolism in Plasmodium significantly differs from that of the host cells, a fundamental requirement for potential drug development (11Ridley R.G. Nature. 2002; 415: 686-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (702) Google Scholar). Specific drugs targeting these enzymes and other proteins of the Plasmodium redox network impair the impressive anti-oxidative defense mechanism (12Sobolewski P. Gramaglia I. Frangos J.A. Intaglietta M. van der Heyde H. Infect. Immun. 2005; 73: 6704-6710Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), thus rendering the parasite more susceptible to continuous oxidative attacks by the host immune response and by endogenously generated ROS. In addition, these drugs are expected to suppress DNA synthesis and cell proliferation.In this study, we addressed the cellular roles of the two arms of the Plasmodium redox pathways, represented by the corresponding NADPH-dependent reductases GR and TrxR, in the rodent malaria model parasite P. berghei. The identification of an essential function (e.g. of P. berghei GR) for survival inside the mosquito vector underscores the central role in the antioxidant defense of the malaria parasite.DISCUSSIONTo date, there is mainly biochemical and pharmacological evidence that the glutathione- and thioredoxin-based redox systems play important roles in blood stage malaria parasites (3Becker K. Tilley L. Vennerstrom J.L. Roberts D. Rogerson S. Ginsburg H. Int. J. Parasitol. 2004; 34: 163-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar, 20Krauth-Siegel R.L. Bauer H. Schirmer R.H. Angew. Chem.

Med. Chem. 2006; 6: 163-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). As a complementation, experimental genetics in an in vivo model is an important tool for drug target validation. In the work described here we studied the essentiality of the two NADPH-dependent flavoenzymes glutathione reductase and thioredoxin reductase for the malaria parasite P. berghei. The two proteins are the principal electron donors for the glutathione and thioredoxin redox networks comprising, among others, peroxiredoxins, glyoxalases, glutathione S-transferase, plasmoredoxin, thioredoxins, and glutaredoxins (1Becker K. Koncarevic S. Hunt N.H. Sherman I.W. Molecular Approaches to Malaria. American Society of Microbiology, Washington D. C.2005: 365-383Google Scholar, 2Müller S. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 53: 1291-1305Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar, 23Becker K. Kanzok S.M. Iozef R. Fischer M. Schirmer R.H. Rahlfs S. Eur. J. Biochem. 2003; 270: 1057-1064Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 24Buchholz K. Rahlfs S. Schirmer R.H. Becker K. Matuschewski K. PLoS One. 2008; 6: e2474Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar).Using double crossover replacement, we successfully deleted the GR locus in P. berghei blood stages. P. berghei TrxR was also efficiently targeted by gene disruption. Interestingly, the loss of GR function resulted in viable and infectious blood stage malaria parasites in vivo. However, for sporogony in the mosquito vector GR was found to be essential. In contrast to previous studies on P. falciparum (17Krnajski Z. Gilberger T.W. Walter R.D. Cowman A.F. Müller S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25970-25975Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), TrxR-deficient P. berghei parasites could be readily obtained. A systematic phenotypic analysis of the PbTrxR(−) mutant throughout the Plasmodium life cycle excluded an essential function for TrxR in any of the developmental stages.The data on GR depletion are supported by a recent report of Vega-Rodriguez et al. (19Vega-Rodríguez J. Franke-Fayard B. Dinglasan R.R. Janse C.J. Pastrana-Mena R. Waters A.P. Coppens I. Rodríguez-Orengo J.F. Srinivasan P. Jacobs-Lorena M. Serrano A.E. PLoS Pathogens. 2009; 5: e1000302Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In their study, the authors disrupted the γ-glutamylcysteine synthetase (γ-GCS) gene of P. berghei. γ-GCS is a critical component of the GSH biosynthesis pathway. Gene disruption resulted in growth retardation and depletion of GSH levels in blood stage parasites. However, like in our study on GR, the gene was not found to be essential. In contrast, γ-GCS gene disruption had a dramatic effect on the development of mosquito stages resulting in reduced numbers of stunted oocysts that did not undergo full sporogony and, therfore, failed to produce sporozoites (19Vega-Rodríguez J. Franke-Fayard B. Dinglasan R.R. Janse C.J. Pastrana-Mena R. Waters A.P. Coppens I. Rodríguez-Orengo J.F. Srinivasan P. Jacobs-Lorena M. Serrano A.E. PLoS Pathogens. 2009; 5: e1000302Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Taken together, the two studies suggest that neither the synthesis nor the GR-based reduction of glutathione are essential for P. berghei blood stages in vivo. This observation is in contrast to biochemical studies which demonstrated lethal effects of a γ-GCS inhibition by l-buthionine sulfoximine on P. falciparum in vitro (21Luersen K. Walter R.D. Müller S. Biochem. J. 2000; 34: 545-552Crossref Google Scholar). The observed differences might be based on the different experimental approaches. However, they might also point to differences in glutathione metabolism and requirements in murine and human malaria parasites. Further studies, like knockouts of the GR and the γ-GCS genes in P. falciparum are required to answer this question.As mentioned above, GR as well as γ-GCS (19Vega-Rodríguez J. Franke-Fayard B. Dinglasan R.R. Janse C.J. Pastrana-Mena R. Waters A.P. Coppens I. Rodríguez-Orengo J.F. Srinivasan P. Jacobs-Lorena M. Serrano A.E. PLoS Pathogens. 2009; 5: e1000302Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) depletion lead to severe disturbance of the development of parasite mosquito stages. The discussed irreversible damage of oocyst mitochondria in γ-GCS depletion might point to enhanced oxidative stress based on limited availability of glutathione. Apart from different metabolic requirements, which might contribute to enhanced oxidative burden, the mosquito stages are extracellular parasite forms and thus potentially exposed to higher fluxes of reactive oxygen species. In addition, it should be kept in mind that dipteric insects including Anopheles and Drosophila do not possess a genuine glutathione reductase (6Kanzok S.M. Schirmer R.H. Turbachova I. Iozef R. Becker K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40180-40186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar, 25Kanzok S.M. Fechner A. Bauer H. Ulschmid J.K. Müller H.M. Botella-Munoz J. Schneuwly S. Schirmer R. Becker K. Science. 2001; 291: 643-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). In these organisms the non-enzymatic reduction of glutathione is, at least partially, effected by reaction with reduced thioredoxin. In the WT parasite, the available enzymatic reduction of glutathione by GR is likely to be much more efficient than in the GR-deficient vector. This constellation might explain why it is impossible for a GR-deficient parasite to develop within a GR-deficient host. Another important observation is the fact that in salivary glands of mosquitoes infected with WT parasites pronounced GR transcripts were determined whereas TrxR-transcripts were hardly detectable (Table 1). This constellation points to a specific role of GR in mosquito stage parasites. This might also explain why the thioredoxin system cannot compensate GR-deficiency in these stages.In our study TrxR-deficient P. berghei parasites were viable throughout the Plasmodium life cycle, although infectivity and parasite counts in the midgut and the salivary glands of the insect vector, as well as in mouse liver were reduced (Table 3). These data exclude an essential function of TrxR in both mammalian host and vector. Notably, in a previous experimental approach TrxR(−) parasites could not be obtained in cultured erythrocytes infected with a P. falciparum laboratory strain (17Krnajski Z. Gilberger T.W. Walter R.D. Cowman A.F. Müller S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25970-25975Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Possible explanations for the strikingly different results include (i) frequently observed technical problems in the P. falciparum transfection system, (ii) an important role of TrxR for Plasmodium under in vitro culture conditions (which only partially reflect the physiological environment and lack feed-back regulation by the host), or (iii) a different role of TrxR in rodent and primate/human parasites, as also discussed above for GR.The fact that neither GR nor TrxR are essential for blood stage P. berghei parasites might be explained by a functional overlap between the glutathione and the thioredoxin system. The major functions of the two systems include recycling of reduced glutathione and thioredoxin, antioxidant defense, redox regulation, and donation of reducing equivalents to other enzymes including ribonucleotide reductase, glutathione S-transferase, glyoxalases, and peroxidases (1Becker K. Koncarevic S. Hunt N.H. Sherman I.W. Molecular Approaches to Malaria. American Society of Microbiology, Washington D. C.2005: 365-383Google Scholar, 2Müller S. Mol.

As mentioned above, numerous organisms including Drosophila melanogaster and Anopheles do completely lack a genuine GR. In these insects, glutathione reduction is maintained by the thioredoxin system (6Kanzok S.M. Schirmer R.H. Turbachova I. Iozef R. Becker K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40180-40186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar, 25Kanzok S.M. Fechner A. Bauer H. Ulschmid J.K. Müller H.M. Botella-Munoz J. Schneuwly S. Schirmer R. Becker K. Science. 2001; 291: 643-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). As recently shown, also humans with inherited complete GR deficiency can live an almost normal life (26Kamerbeek N.M. van Zwieten R. de Boer M. Morren G. Vuil H. Bannink N. Lincke C. Dolman K.M. Becker K. Schirmer R.H. Gromer S. Roos D. Blood. 2007; 109: 3560-3566Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Moreover, P. falciparum efficiently invades and develops inside GR-deficient erythrocytes (27Gallo V. Schwarzer E. Rahlfs S. Schirmer R.H. van Zwieten R. Roos D. Arese P. Becker K. PLoS One. 2009; 4: e7303Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). These observations further support the notion of a functional compensation by the thioredoxin system. Indeed, apart from thioredoxin, also plasmoredoxin, and in many organisms glutaredoxin, have been shown to reduce ribonucleotide reductase, which catalyzes the first step of DNA and RNA synthesis (1Becker K. Koncarevic S. Hunt N.H. Sherman I.W. Molecular Approaches to Malaria. American Society of Microbiology, Washington D. C.2005: 365-383Google Scholar, 23Becker K. Kanzok S.M. Iozef R. Fischer M. Schirmer R.H. Rahlfs S. Eur. J. Biochem. 2003; 270: 1057-1064Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). As recently shown by Sturm et al. (28Sturm N. Mailu B.M. Jortzik E. Koncarevic S. Deponte M. Forchhammer K. Rahlfs S. Becker K. PLoS Pathogens. 2009; 5: e10003Crossref Scopus (66) Google Scholar) using interactome analyses, also the redox regulatory properties of thioredoxin, glutaredoxin, and plasmoredoxin are largely overlapping. Furthermore, the peroxiredoxins acting in Plasmodium are mainly thioredoxin but also glutaredoxin dependent (1Becker K. Koncarevic S. Hunt N.H. Sherman I.W. Molecular Approaches to Malaria. American Society of Microbiology, Washington D. C.2005: 365-383Google Scholar). Concentrations of total glutathione and non-protein bound free thiols were found to not differ significantly between WT and GR(−) or TrxR(−) blood stage parasites. This result supports the finding that the parasites are viable in the absence of either of the two disulfide reductases, and that glutathione and thiol homeostasis are not largely disturbed. Taken together, the available data suggest that in P. berghei blood stage parasites, GR and TrxR might be able to largely compensate for each other. In addition, we cannot exclude that reduction by dihydrolipoamide of glutaredoxins, and indirectly of glutathione disulfide and thioredoxin disulfide, can functionally replace the NADPH-dependent enzymes GR and TrxR (16Ellman G.L.

In case the data should be transferable to P. falciparum, the potential of mere inhibitors of either disulfide reductase as drug candidate needs to be questioned. However, compounds inhibiting both, structurally highly related, disulfide reductases simultaneously and inhibitors acting on PfGR in mosquito stages should still be considered as antimalarial strategies. Furthermore, drugs like methylene blue that act as redox-cycling substrates of plasmodial GR or TrxR (18Buchholz K. Schirmer R.H. Eubel J.K. Akoachere M.B. Dandekar T. Becker K. Gromer S. Antimicrob.

IntroductionAntioxidant enzymes play a decisive role in rapidly growing organisms, including tumor cells and pathogens. Upon a malaria infection, the protozoan parasite Plasmodium continuously multiplies inside host erythrocytes. This specialized lifestyle necessitates the safe management of high oxygen tension. Moreover Plasmodium is under constant exposure to oxidative and nitrosative stress, either generated endogenously by the high metabolic rate or produced exogenously by immune effector cells of the host in response to parasite infection (1Becker K. Koncarevic S. Hunt N.H. Sherman I.W. Molecular Approaches to Malaria. American Society of Microbiology, Washington D. C.2005: 365-383Google Scholar, 2Müller S. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 53: 1291-1305Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). Reactive oxygen species (ROS) 4The abbreviations used are: ROSreactive oxygen speciesGRglutathione reductaseGSHglutathioneMBmethylene blueTrxthioredoxinTrxRthioredoxin reductaseRiboRribonucleotide reductaseTRAPthrombospondin-related anonymous protein. include the superoxide anion (O2·−) formed by univalent reduction of oxygen and the hydroxyl radical (OH•), which can be generated from hydrogen peroxide and the superoxide anion in the presence of iron ions. An imbalance between production and detoxification of these reactive intermediates can lead to local oxidative stress and ultimately damage vital molecules, such as proteins, lipids, or DNA.To maintain and defend their reducing intracellular milieu, numerous organisms including malaria parasites have evolved a dual antioxidative system based on the cysteine-containing redox-active peptides glutathione (GSH) and thioredoxin (Trx) (1Becker K. Koncarevic S. Hunt N.H. Sherman I.W. Molecular Approaches to Malaria. American Society of Microbiology, Washington D. C.2005: 365-383Google Scholar, 2Müller S. Mol.

Parasitol. 2004; 34: 163-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). It should be noted that this dual system also provides the reducing equivalents for converting nucleotides to deoxyribonucleotides, an essential process for DNA synthesis and rapid cell proliferation. Glutathione is the major low molecular weight antioxidant in Plasmodium parasites (4Becker K. Rahlfs S. Nickel C. Schirmer R.H. Biol. Chem. 2003; 384: 551-566PubMed Google Scholar), and it is kept at a high level in the reduced state by the antioxidant enzyme glutathione reductase (GR) (5Schirmer R.H. Bauer H. Becker K. Creighton T.E. Wiley Encyclopedia of Molecular Medicine. John Wiley and Sons, New York, NY2002: 1471-1476Google Scholar), which uses NADPH regenerated in the pentose phosphate pathway as an electron donor. In addition, a complete Trx system, consisting of NADPH, thioredoxin reductase (TrxR), Trx, and a number of Trx-dependent peroxidases, has been characterized in Plasmodium (6Kanzok S.M. Schirmer R.H.

Redox Signal. 2006; 8: 1227-1239Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Curiously, the malarial and related apicomplexan parasites lack catalase and a classical, selenium-containing glutathione peroxidase, two central antioxidant enzymes present in a wide range of organisms to protect themselves against hydrogen peroxide. In kinetoplastid parasites, the thioredoxin and glutathione systems are replaced by a unique redox system based on trypanothione (9Fairlamb A.H. Cerami A. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1992; 46: 695-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (684) Google Scholar, 10Krauth-Siegel R.L. Meiering S.K. Schmidt H. Biol. Chem. 2003; 384: 539-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar).The apparent deficiency of such a unique antioxidant defense system in Plasmodium further underscores the central importance of the two antioxidant pathways, represented by GR and TrxR, in the parasite. Therefore, the redox metabolism in Plasmodium significantly differs from that of the host cells, a fundamental requirement for potential drug development (11Ridley R.G. Nature. 2002; 415: 686-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (702) Google Scholar). Specific drugs targeting these enzymes and other proteins of the Plasmodium redox network impair the impressive anti-oxidative defense mechanism (12Sobolewski P. Gramaglia I. Frangos J.A. Intaglietta M. van der Heyde H. Infect. Immun. 2005; 73: 6704-6710Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), thus rendering the parasite more susceptible to continuous oxidative attacks by the host immune response and by endogenously generated ROS. In addition, these drugs are expected to suppress DNA synthesis and cell proliferation.In this study, we addressed the cellular roles of the two arms of the Plasmodium redox pathways, represented by the corresponding NADPH-dependent reductases GR and TrxR, in the rodent malaria model parasite P. berghei. The identification of an essential function (e.g. of P. berghei GR) for survival inside the mosquito vector underscores the central role in the antioxidant defense of the malaria parasite. Antioxidant enzymes play a decisive role in rapidly growing organisms, including tumor cells and pathogens. Upon a malaria infection, the protozoan parasite Plasmodium continuously multiplies i"

We have examined the effects of IGFBP-3 on EGF responses of breast epithelial cells in the context of changes in the extracellular matrix. On plastic and laminin with MCF-10A normal breast epithelial cells, EGF and IGFBP-3 each increased cell growth and together produced a synergistic response, whereas with T47D breast cancer cells IGFBP-3 alone had no effect, but the ability of EGF to increase cell proliferation was markedly inhibited in the presence of IGFBP-3. In contrast on fibronectin with MCF-10A cells, IGFBP-3 alone inhibited cell growth and blocked EGF-induced proliferation. With the cancer cells, IGFBP-3 alone had no effect but enhanced the EGF-induced increase in cell growth. The insulin-like growth factor-independent effects of IGFBP-3 alone on cell proliferation were completely abrogated in the presence of an EGFR, tyrosine kinase inhibitor, Iressa. Although IGFBP-3 did not affect EGFR phosphorylation [Tyr(1068)], it was found to modulate receptor internalization and was associated with activation of Rho and subsequent changes in MAPK phosphorylation. The levels of fibronectin and IGFBP-3 within breast tumors may determine their dependence on EGFR and their response to therapies targeting this receptor."
https://openalex.org/W2025782870,"Cbl is an adaptor protein and an E3 ligase that plays both positive and negative roles in several signaling pathways that affect various cellular functions. Tyrosine 737 is unique to Cbl and is phosphorylated by Syk and Src family kinases. Phosphorylated Cbl Tyr(737) creates a binding site for the p85 regulatory subunit of PI3K, which also plays an important role in the regulation of bone resorption by osteoclasts. To investigate the role of Cbl-PI3K interaction in bone homeostasis, we examined the knock-in mice (Cbl(YF/YF)) in which the PI3K binding site in Cbl is ablated due to the mutation in the regulatory tyrosine. We report that in Cbl(YF/YF) mice, despite increased numbers of osteoclasts, bone volume is increased due to defective osteoclast function. Additionally, in ex vivo cultures, mature Cbl(YF/YF) osteoclasts showed an increased ability to survive in the presence of RANKL due to delayed onset of apoptosis. RANKL-mediated signaling is perturbed in Cbl(YF/YF) osteoclasts, and most interestingly, AKT phosphorylation is up-regulated, suggesting that the lack of PI3K sequestration by Cbl results in increased survival and decreased bone resorption. Cumulatively, these in vivo and in vitro results show that, on one hand, binding of Cbl to PI3K negatively regulates osteoclast differentiation, survival, and signaling events (e.g. AKT phosphorylation), whereas on the other hand it positively influences osteoclast function."
https://openalex.org/W2057665554,"Escherichia coli RecX (RecX(Ec)) is a negative regulator of RecA activities both in the bacterial cell and in vitro. In contrast, the Neisseria gonorrhoeae RecX protein (RecX(Ng)) enhances all RecA-related processes in N. gonorrhoeae. Surprisingly, the RecX(Ng) protein is not a RecA protein activator in vitro. Instead, RecX(Ng) is a much more potent inhibitor of all RecA(Ng) and RecA(Ec) activities than is the E. coli RecX ortholog. A series of RecX(Ng) mutant proteins representing a gradient of functional deficiencies provide a direct correlation between RecA(Ng) inhibition in vitro and the enhancement of RecA(Ng) function in N. gonorrhoeae. Unlike RecX(Ec), RecX(Ng) does not simply cap the growing ends of RecA filaments, but it directly facilitates a more rapid RecA filament disassembly. Thus, in N. gonorrhoeae, recombinational processes are facilitated by RecX(Ng) protein-mediated limitations on RecA(Ng) filament presence and/or length to achieve maximal function."
https://openalex.org/W2128279120,"Escherichia coli K1, the most common cause of meningitis in neonates, has been shown to interact with GlcNAc1-4GlcNAc epitopes of Ecgp96 on human brain microvascular endothelial cells (HBMECs) via OmpA (outer membrane protein A). However, the precise domains of extracellular loops of OmpA interacting with the chitobiose epitopes have not been elucidated. We report the loop-barrel model of these OmpA interactions with the carbohydrate moieties of Ecgp96 predicted from molecular modeling. To test this model experimentally, we generated E. coli K1 strains expressing OmpA with mutations of residues predicted to be critical for interaction with the HBMEC and tested E. coli invasion efficiency. For these same mutations, we predicted the interaction free energies (including explicit calculation of the entropy) from molecular dynamics (MD), finding excellent correlation (R(2) = 90%) with experimental invasion efficiency. Particularly important is that mutating specific residues in loops 1, 2, and 4 to alanines resulted in significant inhibition of E. coli K1 invasion in HBMECs, which is consistent with the complete lack of binding found in the MD simulations for these two cases. These studies suggest that inhibition of the interactions of these residues of Loop 1, 2, and 4 with Ecgp96 could provide a therapeutic strategy to prevent neonatal meningitis due to E. coli K1."

Here, we report that site-specific replication termination in Schizosaccharomyces pombe is modulated by protein-mediated interactions between pairs of Ter sites located either on the same or on different chromosomes. The dimeric Reb1 protein catalyzes termination and mediates interaction between Ter sites. The Reb1-dependent interactions between two antiparallel Ter sites in cis caused looping out of the intervening DNA in vitro and enhancement of fork arrest in vivo. A Ter site on chromosome 2 interacted pairwise with two Ter sites located on chromosome 1 by chromosome kissing. Mutational inactivation of the major interacting Ter site on chromosome 1 significantly reduced fork arrest at the Ter site on chromosome 2, thereby revealing a cooperative mechanism of control of replication termination."
https://openalex.org/W2054882735,"p53 is a thermodynamically unstable protein containing a conformationally flexible multiprotein docking site within the DNA-binding domain. A combinatorial peptide chip used to identify the novel kinase consensus site RXSΦ(K/D) led to the discovery of a homologous phosphorylation site in the S10 β-strand of p53 at Ser(269). Overlapping peptide libraries confirmed that Ser(269) was a phosphoacceptor site in vitro, and immunochemical approaches evaluated whether p53 is phosphorylated in vivo at Ser(269). Mutation or phosphorylation of p53 at Ser(269) attenuates binding of the p53-specific monoclonal antibody DO-12, identifying an assay for measuring Ser(269) phosphorylation of p53 in vivo. The mAb DO-12 epitope of p53 is masked via phosphorylation in a range of human tumor cells with WT p53 status, as defined by increased mAb DO-12 binding to endogenous p53 after phosphatase treatment. Phospho-Ser(269)-specific monoclonal antibodies were generated and used to demonstrate that p53 phosphorylation is induced at Ser(269) after irradiation with kinetics similar to those of p53 protein induction. Phosphomimetic mutation at Ser(269) inactivated the transcription activation function and clonogenic suppressor activity of p53. These data suggest that the dynamic equilibrium between native and unfolded states of WT p53 can be modulated by phosphorylation of the conformationally flexible multiprotein binding site in the p53 DNA-binding domain."

A variety of mammalian transmembrane proteins, among them many of the immunoglobulin superfamily, have been implicated in cell-cell fusion, but none has been shown to actively fuse cells in vitro. Here we report that the FGFRL1 receptor, which is up-regulated during the differentiation of myoblasts into myotubes, fuses cultured cells into large, multinucleated syncytia. We used luciferase and GFP-based reporter assays to confirm cytoplasmic mixing and to identify the fusion inducing domain of FGFRL1. These assays revealed that Ig-like domain III and the transmembrane domain are both necessary and sufficient to rapidly fuse CHO cells into multinucleated syncytia comprising several hundred nuclei. Moreover, FGFRL1 also fused HEK293 and HeLa cells with untransfected CHO cells.

https://openalex.org/W2171524879,"The gene for the mismatch-specific uracil DNA glycosylase (MUG) was identified in the Escherichia coli genome as a sequence homolog of the human thymine DNA glycosylase with activity against mismatched uracil base pairs. Examination of cell extracts led us to detect a previously unknown xanthine DNA glycosylase (XDG) activity in E. coli. DNA glycosylase assays with purified enzymes indicated the novel XDG activity is attributable to MUG. Here, we report a biochemical characterization of xanthine DNA glycosylase activity in MUG. The wild type MUG possesses more robust activity against xanthine than uracil and is active against all xanthine-containing DNA (C/X, T/X, G/X, A/X and single-stranded X). Analysis of potentials of mean force indicates that the double-stranded xanthine base pairs have a relatively narrow energetic difference in base flipping, whereas the tendency for uracil base flipping follows the order of C/U > G/U > T/U > A/U. Site-directed mutagenesis performed on conserved motifs revealed that Asn-140 and Ser-23 are important determinants for XDG activity in E. coli MUG. Molecular modeling and molecular dynamics simulations reveal distinct hydrogen-bonding patterns in the active site of E. coli MUG that account for the specificity differences between E. coli MUG and human thymine DNA glycosylase as well as that between the wild type MUG and the Asn-140 and Ser-23 mutants. This study underscores the role of the favorable binding interactions in modulating the specificity of DNA glycosylases."

https://openalex.org/W2061921749,"Four-way junctions are non-B DNA structures that originate as intermediates of recombination and repair (Holliday junctions) or from the intrastrand annealing of palindromic sequences (cruciforms). These structures have important functional roles but may also severely interfere with DNA replication and other genetic processes; therefore, they are targeted by regulatory and architectural proteins, and dedicated pathways exist for their removal. Although it is well known that resolution of Holliday junctions occurs either by recombinases or by specialized helicases, less is known on the mechanisms dealing with secondary structures in nucleic acids. Reverse gyrase is a DNA topoisomerase, specific to microorganisms living at high temperatures, which comprises a type IA topoisomerase fused to an SF2 helicase-like module and catalyzes ATP hydrolysis-dependent DNA positive supercoiling. Reverse gyrase is likely involved in regulation of DNA structure and stability and might also participate in the cell response to DNA damage. By applying FRET technology to multiplex fluorophore gel imaging, we show here that reverse gyrase induces unwinding of synthetic four-way junctions as well as forked DNA substrates, following a mechanism independent of both the ATPase and the strand-cutting activity of the enzyme. The reaction requires high temperature and saturating protein concentrations. Our results suggest that reverse gyrase works like an ATP-independent helix-destabilizing protein specific for branched DNA structures. The results are discussed in light of reverse gyrase function and their general relevance for protein-mediated unwinding of complex DNA structures."
