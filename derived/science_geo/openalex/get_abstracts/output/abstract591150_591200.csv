https://openalex.org/W2736476343,"Immunotherapy with PD-1 checkpoint blockade is effective in only a minority of patients with cancer, suggesting that additional treatment strategies are needed. Here we use a pooled in vivo genetic screening approach using CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing in transplantable tumours in mice treated with immunotherapy to discover previously undescribed immunotherapy targets. We tested 2,368 genes expressed by melanoma cells to identify those that synergize with or cause resistance to checkpoint blockade. We recovered the known immune evasion molecules PD-L1 and CD47, and confirmed that defects in interferon-γ signalling caused resistance to immunotherapy. Tumours were sensitized to immunotherapy by deletion of genes involved in several diverse pathways, including NF-κB signalling, antigen presentation and the unfolded protein response. In addition, deletion of the protein tyrosine phosphatase PTPN2 in tumour cells increased the efficacy of immunotherapy by enhancing interferon-γ-mediated effects on antigen presentation and growth suppression. In vivo genetic screens in tumour models can identify new immunotherapy targets in unanticipated pathways."

AMPK is a central regulator of metabolic homeostasis, and its dysfunction may result in various diseases including diabetes, obesity, and cancer. AMPK is known to be activated under stressful conditions, including glucose starvation. It has been assumed that upon glucose deprivation AMPK activation occurs in the canonical AMP/ADP-dependent manner, with reduced metabolism of glucose causing falling ATP and increasing AMP and ADP. Here, Sheng-Cai Lin and colleagues show that this is not the case, and that glucose starvation activates AMPK via a different route, in an AMP/ADP-independent manner. During glycolysis, glucose is converted to fructose-1,6-bisphosphate (FBP), which is then processed by FBP aldolases. The authors show that the absence of glucose results in a reduction of FBP-bound aldolase, which triggers LKB1 phosphorylation and activation of AMPK. This study thus uncovers FBP as the critical metabolite that signals glucose availability and FBP aldolases as the sensors that relay the information to AMPK. The major energy source for most cells is glucose, from which ATP is generated via glycolysis and/or oxidative metabolism. Glucose deprivation activates AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)1, but it is unclear whether this activation occurs solely via changes in AMP or ADP, the classical activators of AMPK2,3,4,5. Here, we describe an AMP/ADP-independent mechanism that triggers AMPK activation by sensing the absence of fructose-1,6-bisphosphate (FBP), with AMPK being progressively activated as extracellular glucose and intracellular FBP decrease. When unoccupied by FBP, aldolases promote the formation of a lysosomal complex containing at least v-ATPase, ragulator, axin, liver kinase B1 (LKB1) and AMPK, which has previously been shown to be required for AMPK activation6,7. Knockdown of aldolases activates AMPK even in cells with abundant glucose, whereas the catalysis-defective D34S aldolase mutant, which still binds FBP, blocks AMPK activation. Cell-free reconstitution assays show that addition of FBP disrupts the association of axin and LKB1 with v-ATPase and ragulator. Importantly, in some cell types AMP/ATP and ADP/ATP ratios remain unchanged during acute glucose starvation, and intact AMP-binding sites on AMPK are not required for AMPK activation. These results establish that aldolase, as well as being a glycolytic enzyme, is a sensor of glucose availability that regulates AMPK."
https://openalex.org/W2734470795,"In many prokaryotes, type III clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)-CRISPR-associated (Cas) systems detect and degrade invasive genetic elements by an RNA-guided, RNA-targeting multisubunit interference complex. The CRISPR-associated protein Csm6 additionally contributes to interference by functioning as a standalone RNase that degrades invader RNA transcripts, but the mechanism linking invader sensing to Csm6 activity is not understood. Here we show that Csm6 proteins are activated through a second messenger generated by the type III interference complex. Upon target RNA binding by the interference complex, its Cas10 subunit converts ATP into a cyclic oligoadenylate product, which allosterically activates Csm6 by binding to its CRISPR-associated Rossmann fold (CARF) domain. CARF domain mutations that abolish allosteric activation inhibit Csm6 activity in vivo, and mutations in the Cas10 Palm domain phenocopy loss of Csm6. Together, these results point to an unprecedented mechanism for regulation of CRISPR interference that bears striking conceptual similarity to oligoadenylate signalling in mammalian innate immunity."

https://openalex.org/W2736763193,"Mammalian sperm and oocytes have different epigenetic landscapes and are organized in different fashions. After fertilization, the initially distinct parental epigenomes become largely equalized with the exception of certain loci, including imprinting control regions. How parental chromatin becomes equalized and how imprinting control regions escape from this reprogramming is largely unknown. Here we profile parental allele-specific DNase I hypersensitive sites in mouse zygotes and morula embryos, and investigate the epigenetic mechanisms underlying these allelic sites. Integrated analyses of DNA methylome and tri-methylation at lysine 27 of histone H3 (H3K27me3) chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing identify 76 genes with paternal allele-specific DNase I hypersensitive sites that are devoid of DNA methylation but harbour maternal allele-specific H3K27me3. Interestingly, these genes are paternally expressed in preimplantation embryos, and ectopic removal of H3K27me3 induces maternal allele expression. H3K27me3-dependent imprinting is largely lost in the embryonic cell lineage, but at least five genes maintain their imprinted expression in the extra-embryonic cell lineage. The five genes include all paternally expressed autosomal imprinted genes previously demonstrated to be independent of oocyte DNA methylation. Thus, our study identifies maternal H3K27me3 as a DNA methylation-independent imprinting mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W2737989178,"The cortex represents information across widely varying timescales. For instance, sensory cortex encodes stimuli that fluctuate over few tens of milliseconds, whereas in association cortex behavioural choices can require the maintenance of information over seconds. However, it remains poorly understood whether diverse timescales result mostly from features intrinsic to individual neurons or from neuronal population activity. This question remains unanswered, because the timescales of coding in populations of neurons have not been studied extensively, and population codes have not been compared systematically across cortical regions. Here we show that population codes can be essential to achieve long coding timescales. Furthermore, we find that the properties of population codes differ between sensory and association cortices. We compared coding for sensory stimuli and behavioural choices in auditory cortex and posterior parietal cortex as mice performed a sound localization task. Auditory stimulus information was stronger in auditory cortex than in posterior parietal cortex, and both regions contained choice information. Although auditory cortex and posterior parietal cortex coded information by tiling in time neurons that were transiently informative for approximately 200 milliseconds, the areas had major differences in functional coupling between neurons, measured as activity correlations that could not be explained by task events. Coupling among posterior parietal cortex neurons was strong and extended over long time lags, whereas coupling among auditory cortex neurons was weak and short-lived. Stronger coupling in posterior parietal cortex led to a population code with long timescales and a representation of choice that remained consistent for approximately 1 second. In contrast, auditory cortex had a code with rapid fluctuations in stimulus and choice information over hundreds of milliseconds. Our results reveal that population codes differ across cortex and that coupling is a variable property of cortical populations that affects the timescale of information coding and the accuracy of behaviour."
https://openalex.org/W2737684614,"Fusarium oxysporum formae specialis cubense (Foc) is a soil-borne fungus that causes Fusarium wilt, which is considered to be the most destructive disease of bananas. The fungus is believed to have evolved with its host in the Indo-Malayan region, and from there it was spread to other banana-growing areas with infected planting material. The diversity and distribution of Foc in Asia was investigated. A total of 594 F. oxysporum isolates collected in ten Asian countries were identified by vegetative compatibility groups (VCGs) analysis. To simplify the identification process, the isolates were first divided into DNA lineages using PCR-RFLP analysis. Six lineages and 14 VCGs, representing three Foc races, were identified in this study. The VCG complex 0124/5 was most common in the Indian subcontinent, Vietnam and Cambodia; whereas the VCG complex 01213/16 dominated in the rest of Asia. Sixty-nine F. oxysporum isolates in this study did not match any of the known VCG tester strains. In this study, Foc VCG diversity in Bangladesh, Cambodia and Sri Lanka was determined for the first time and VCGs 01221 and 01222 were first reported from Cambodia and Vietnam. New associations of Foc VCGs and banana cultivars were recorded in all the countries where the fungus was collected. Information obtained in this study could help Asian countries to develop and implement regulatory measures to prevent the incursion of Foc into areas where it does not yet occur. It could also facilitate the deployment of disease resistant banana varieties in infested areas."
https://openalex.org/W2739315486,"Multi-drug resistance has become a major problem for the treatment of pathogenic bacterial infections. The use of bacteriophages is an attractive approach to overcome the problem of drug resistance in several pathogens that cause fatal diseases. Our study aimed to isolate multi drug resistant bacteria from patients with septic wounds and then isolate and apply bacteriophages in vitro as alternative therapeutic agents. Pus samples were aseptically collected from Rajiv Gandhi Institute of Medical Science (RIMS), Kadapa, A.P., and samples were analyzed by gram staining, evaluating morphological characteristics, and biochemical methods. MDR-bacterial strains were collected using the Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion method against a variety of antibiotics. Bacteriophages were collected and tested in vitro for lytic activity against MDR-bacterial isolates. Analysis of the pus swab samples revealed that the most of the isolates detected had Pseudomonas aeruginosa as the predominant bacterium, followed by Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Escherichia coli. Our results suggested that gram-negative bacteria were more predominant than gram-positive bacteria in septic wounds; most of these isolates were resistant to ampicillin, amoxicillin, penicillin, vancomycin and tetracycline. All the gram-positive isolates (100%) were multi-drug resistant, whereas 86% of the gram-negative isolates had a drug resistant nature. Further bacteriophages isolated from sewage demonstrated perfect lytic activity against the multi-drug resistant bacteria causing septic wounds. In vitro analysis of the isolated bacteriophages demonstrated perfect lysis against the corresponding MDR-bacteria, and these isolated phages may be promising as a first choice for prophylaxis against wound sepsis, Moreover, phage therapy does not enhance multi-drug resistance in bacteria and could work simultaneously on a wide variety of MDR-bacteria when used in a bacteriophage cocktail. Hence, our results suggest that these bacteriophages could be potential therapeutic options for treating septic wounds caused by P. aeruginosa, S. aureus, K. pneumoniae and E. coli."
https://openalex.org/W2737855299,"The radiation-induced bystander effect (RIBE) refers to a unique process in which factors released by irradiated cells or tissues exert effects on other parts of the animal not exposed to radiation, causing genomic instability, stress responses and altered apoptosis or cell proliferation. Although RIBEs have important implications for radioprotection, radiation safety and radiotherapy, the molecular identities of RIBE factors and their mechanisms of action remain poorly understood. Here we use Caenorhabditis elegans as a model in which to study RIBEs, and identify the cysteine protease CPR-4, a homologue of human cathepsin B, as the first RIBE factor in nematodes, to our knowledge. CPR-4 is secreted from animals irradiated with ultraviolet or ionizing gamma rays, and is the major factor in the conditioned medium that leads to the inhibition of cell death and increased embryonic lethality in unirradiated animals. Moreover, CPR-4 causes these effects and stress responses at unexposed sites distal to the irradiated tissue. The activity of CPR-4 is regulated by the p53 homologue CEP-1 in response to radiation, and CPR-4 seems to exert RIBEs by acting through the insulin-like growth factor receptor DAF-2. Our study provides crucial insights into RIBEs, and will facilitate the identification of additional RIBE factors and their mechanisms of action."
https://openalex.org/W2736768507,"The lysosomal potassium channel TMEM175 has a tetrameric structure unlike that of the canonical potassium channels, with an hourglass-shaped pore in which isoleucine residues have a key role in channel selectivity. Voltage-gated potassium channels allow potassium to selectively flow across the membrane and have key roles in maintaining membrane potential and pH balance. Here, Youxing Jiang and colleagues present the crystal structure and functional studies of a new class of tetrameric cation channels, TMEM175, that share no homology with canonical K+ channels. This recently identified lysosomal channel has an unusual tetrameric architecture and contains a distinct ion conduction pathway involving a bottleneck-shaped pore just 3 Å wide at its narrowest point. The bottleneck contains an isoleucine residue proposed to play a key role in channel selectivity for K+ ions. This suggests an unusual mode of action involving a dehydration mechanism reminiscent of that of synthetic nanopores or carbon nanotubes. TMEM175 is a lysosomal K+ channel that is important for maintaining the membrane potential and pH stability in lysosomes1. It contains two homologous copies of a six-transmembrane-helix (6-TM) domain, which has no sequence homology to the canonical tetrameric K+ channels and lacks the TVGYG selectivity filter motif found in these channels2,3,4. The prokaryotic TMEM175 channel, which is present in a subset of bacteria and archaea, contains only a single 6-TM domain and functions as a tetramer. Here, we present the crystal structure of a prokaryotic TMEM175 channel from Chamaesiphon minutus, CmTMEM175, the architecture of which represents a completely different fold from that of canonical K+ channels. All six transmembrane helices of CmTMEM175 are tightly packed within each subunit without undergoing domain swapping. The highly conserved TM1 helix acts as the pore-lining inner helix, creating an hourglass-shaped ion permeation pathway in the channel tetramer. Three layers of hydrophobic residues on the carboxy-terminal half of the TM1 helices form a bottleneck along the ion conduction pathway and serve as the selectivity filter of the channel. Mutagenesis analysis suggests that the first layer of the highly conserved isoleucine residues in the filter is primarily responsible for channel selectivity. Thus, the structure of CmTMEM175 represents a novel architecture of a tetrameric cation channel whose ion selectivity mechanism appears to be distinct from that of the classical K+ channel family."
https://openalex.org/W2737056279,"With over 300 million active users, Twitter is among the largest online news and social networking services in existence today. Open access to information on Twitter makes it a valuable source of data for research on social interactions, sentiment analysis, content diffusion, link prediction, and the dynamics behind human collective behaviour in general. Here we use Twitter data to construct co-occurrence language networks based on hashtags and based on all the words in tweets, and we use these networks to study link prediction by means of different methods and evaluation metrics. In addition to using five known methods, we propose two effective weighted similarity measures, and we compare the obtained outcomes in dependence on the selected semantic context of topics on Twitter. We find that hashtag networks yield to a large degree equal results as all-word networks, thus supporting the claim that hashtags alone robustly capture the semantic context of tweets, and as such are useful and suitable for studying the content and categorization. We also introduce ranking diagrams as an efficient tool for the comparison of the performance of different link prediction algorithms across multiple datasets. Our research indicates that successful link prediction algorithms work well in correctly foretelling highly probable links even if the information about a network structure is incomplete, and they do so even if the semantic context is rationalized to hashtags."
https://openalex.org/W2737431762,"Background Hospital-acquired infection affects hundreds of millions of people worldwide. It is a major global issue for patient safety. Understanding the potential risk factors is important to appreciate the local context. A matched case control study design, which is the first of its kind in the study region, was undertaken to identify risk factors in teaching hospitals of Amhara regional state, Ethiopia. Method A matched case control study design matched with age and hospital type was used. The study was conducted in University of Gondar and Felege-Hiwot medical teaching hospital. Cases were patients who fulfilled the criteria based on CDC definition of hospital-acquired infection and controls were patients admitted to the hospital that stayed for more than 48 hours in the ward in the study period, but who did not develop infection. For one case, four controls were selected. Of 545 patients, 109 were cases and 436 were controls. Conditional logistic regression using STATA 13 was used for data analysis. Result The median length of stay for cases and controls was 7 and 8 days, respectively. Patients admitted in wards with the presence of medical waste container in the room had 82% less chance of developing hospital-acquired infection (AOR 0.18; 95% CI, 0.03–0.98). The odds of developing hospital-acquired infection among immune deficient patients were 2.34 times higher than their counterparts (95% CI; 1.17–4.69). Patients received antimicrobials, central vascular catheter and surgery since admission had 8.63, 6.91 and 2.35 higher odds of developing hospital-acquired infection, respectively. Conclusion Health providers and mangers should consider the provision and availability of healthcare materials and facilities in all of the ward rooms, follow appropriate safe medical procedures for use of external devices on patients, and give attention to the immunocompromised patients for the prevention and control of hospital-acquired infections."
https://openalex.org/W2738573440,"The epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells plays a central role in the development of proliferative vitreoretinopathy (PVR). The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), a key regulator of energy homeostasis, on the EMT in RPE cells. In this study, EMT-associated formation of cellular aggregates was induced by co-stimulation of cultured ARPE-19 cells with tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α (10 ng/ml) and transforming growth factor (TGF)-β2 (5 ng/ml). 5-Aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide-1-β-D-ribofuranoside (AICAR), a potent activator of AMPK, significantly suppressed TNF-α and TGF-β2-induced cellular aggregate formation (p < 0.01). Dipyridamole almost completely reversed the suppressive effect of AICAR, whereas 5’-amino-5’-deoxyadenosine restored aggregate formation by approximately 50%. AICAR suppressed the downregulation of E-cadherin and the upregulation of fibronectin and α-smooth muscle actin by TNF-α and TGF-β2. The levels of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2, MMP-9, interleukin-6, and vascular endothelial growth factor were significantly decreased by AICAR. Activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase and mammalian target of rapamycin pathways, but not the Smad pathway, was inhibited by AICAR. These findings indicate that AICAR suppresses the EMT in RPE cells at least partially via activation of AMPK. AMPK is a potential target molecule for the prevention and treatment of PVR, so AICAR may be a promising candidate for PVR therapy."

https://openalex.org/W2736638398,"Background There are few studies of careful examination of wildlife casualties in Wildlife Rehabilitation Centers. These studies are essential for detecting menaces to wild species and providing objective criteria about cost-benefit of treatments in those centers. The release rate is considered the main outcome indicator, but other parameters such as length of stay at the center and a cost-benefit index expressed as number of released animals per euro and day, could be used as reliable estimators of the rehabilitation costs. Methodology A retrospective study based on 54772 admissions recorded from 1995–2013 in the database of the Wildlife Rehabilitation Center of Torreferrussa (Catalonia, NW Spain) assessed the morbidity, outcomes and cost-benefits of the rehabilitation practices. Results Three hundred and two species were included: 232 birds (n = 48633), 37 mammals (n = 3293), 20 reptiles (n = 2705) and 13 amphibians (n = 141). The most frequent causes of admission were: 39.8% confiscation of protected species (89.4% passerines), 31.8% orphaned young animals (35.3% swifts, 21.7% diurnal raptors and owls) and 17.4% trauma casualties (46.7% raptors and owls). The highest proportion of releases was found in the captivity confiscation category [87.4% passerines (median time of stay: 12 days)], followed by the orphaned category [78% owls (66 days), 76.5% diurnal birds of prey (43 days), 75.6% hedgehogs (49 days), 52.7% swifts (19 days) and 52% bats (55 days)]. For the trauma group, 46.8% of releases were hedgehogs (44 days) and 25.6% owls (103 days). As regards the cost-benefit index, the trauma casualties and infectious diseases had the worse values with 1.3 and 1.4 released animals/euro/day respectively, and were particularly low in raptors, waders, marine birds and chiroptera. On the contrary, captivity (4.6) and misplacement (4.1) had the best index, particulary in amphibian, reptiles and passerines. Conclusions/significance Cost-benefit studies including the release rate, the time of stay at the center and the cost-benefit index should be implemented for improving management efficiency of the Wildlife Rehabilitation Centers."
https://openalex.org/W2738901483,"Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae is the etiologic agent of swine enzootic pneumonia. However other mycoplasma species and secondary bacteria are found as inhabitants of the swine respiratory tract, which can be also related to disease. In the present study we have performed a total DNA metagenomic analysis from the lungs of pigs kept in a field condition, with suggestive signals of enzootic pneumonia and without any infection signals to evaluate the bacteria variability of the lungs microbiota. Libraries from metagenomic DNA were prepared and sequenced using total DNA shotgun metagenomic pyrosequencing. The metagenomic distribution showed a great abundance of bacteria. The most common microbial families identified from pneumonic swine's lungs were Mycoplasmataceae, Flavobacteriaceae and Pasteurellaceae, whereas in the carrier swine's lungs the most common families were Mycoplasmataceae, Bradyrhizobiaceae and Flavobacteriaceae. Analysis of community composition in both samples confirmed the high prevalence of M. hyopneumoniae. Moreover, the carrier lungs had more diverse family population, which should be related to the lungs normal flora. In summary, we provide a wide view of the bacterial population from lungs with signals of enzootic pneumonia and lungs without signals of enzootic pneumonia in a field situation. These bacteria patterns provide information that may be important for the establishment of disease control measures and to give insights for further studies."

In 83 patients CTCs were also enumerated using the CellSearch.Sequential samples were available from 76 and 48 patients after one-treatment cycle and on disease progression (PD), respectively, for immunofluorescence and from 50 and 36 patients after one-cycle and on PD, respectively, for CellSearch. At baseline, 60.2% of the patients had detectable CTCs by either method. Both proliferative (CK67+) and non-proliferative (Ki67-), apoptotic (M30+) and non-apoptotic (M30-) as well as EMT (Vim+) CTCs were present in the same patient. Among 22 patients without detectable CTCs by CellSearch, CK+/Ki67+ and CK+/Vim+ CTCs could be detected in 6 (27.3%) and 6 (27.3%) patients, respectively. One-chemotherapy cycle reduced both the incidence of detection (p<0.001) and the absolute number (p<0.001) of CTCs; conversely, on PD both the incidence of detection and the number of CTCs were significantly increased (p = 0.002 and p = 0.04, respectively). Multivariate analysis revealed that the increased number of Vim+ CTCs at baseline and of non-apoptotic CTCs on PD could be emerged as independent prognostic factors associated with decreased OS(p = 0.009 and p = 0.023, respectively).CK+/Ki67+, CK+/M30+ and CK+/Vim+ CTCs represent distinct subpopulations of CTCs in patients with SCLC, can be detected even in the absence of detectable CTCs by CellSearch; CK+/Ki67+ and CK+/Vim+ CTCs are associated with unfavorable clinical outcome."

However, information was scarce on the current status of these infections to guide an intervention in the study area. Therefore, this study was conducted to assess the prevalence of infections with S. mansoni and STHs and associated factors among school children in southern Ethiopia.This cross-sectional study investigated children who were attending the Finchawa and Tullo junior elementary schools and were residing along the shore of the lake Hawassa in January and February, 2015. A total of 374 students were selected using systematic random sampling technique. Data on socio-demography and related factors was collected using structured questionnaires. A single stool sample was collected from each child and processed using formol-ether concentration technique and examined microscopically for parasites' ova/larva.The prevalence of parasitic infection with one or more than one helminthiasis was found to be 67.9%. Seven different types of helminths were identified and the most prevalent parasites were Ascaris lumbricoides (44.4%), followed by S. mansoni (31%), Trichuris trichiura (11%), and hookworms (7.7%). The rate of infection with STHs was 52.4%. Single, double, triple and quadruple infections were 42.2, 22.5, 2.4, and 0.8%, respectively. Children who practiced open-field defecation (AOR, 3.6; 95% CI 1.6-8.0; p = 0.001) and had not always washed their hands before eating a meal (AOR, 5.0; 95%CI 2.15-11.7; p <0.001) were more infected with STHs. Moreover, the rate of S. mansoni infection was significantly higher among children who were attending the Finchawa school (AOR, 2.13; 95% CI 1.31-3.46; p = 0.002), aged 11-15 years (AOR, 1.97; 95% CI 1.22-3.19; p = 0.006), had swum in the lake Hawassa (AOR, 2.73; 95%CI 1.20-6.17; p = 0.016), and had involved in irrigation-related activities (AOR, 1.68; 95%CI 1.04-2.71; p = 0.034).The study showed high prevalence of STHs and moderate rate of schisotosomiasis. Mass deworming twice a year for STHs and once every two years for S. mansoni, further to strengthening other prevention measures, is critically needed to reduce these infections to inconsequential level."
https://openalex.org/W2736897780,"Tumor cells have the capacity to secrete immunosuppressive substances in order to diminish dendritic cell (DC) activity and thereby escape from immune responses. The impact of mistletoe (Viscum album) extracts (VAE), which are frequently used as an additive anti-cancer therapy to stimulate the immune response, is still unknown. Using a human cellular system, the impact of two different VAE (VAEA + VAEI) on the maturation of human dendritic cells and on T cell function has been investigated using flow cytometry, automated fluorescence microscopy and cytokine bead array assays. Furthermore, we examined whether VAEI was able to counteract tumor-induced immunosuppression within this cellular system using a renal cancer cell model. The role of mistletoe lectin (ML) was analyzed using ML-specific antibodies and ML-depleted VAEI. VAEI and VAEA augmented the maturation of dendritic cells. VAEI abrogated tumor-induced immunosuppression of dendritic cells and both processes were partially mediated by ML since ML-depleted VAEI and ML-specific antibodies almost neutralized the rehabilitative effects of VAEI on DC maturation. Using these settings, co-culture experiments with purified CD4+ T cells had no influence on T cell proliferation and activation but did have an impact on IFN-γ secretion. The study provides a potential mode-of-action of VAE as an additive cancer therapy based on immunomodulatory effects. However, the impact on the in vivo situation has to be evaluated in further studies."

Particles prepared at low reaction temperatures exhibit the highest degree of spreading due to the lightly cross-linked and flexible polymer network. Moreover, AFM force spectroscopy studies suggest that cross-linker-free microgels constitute of a more homogeneous polymer network than PEG-DA cross-linked particles and have elastic moduli at the particle apex that are ~5 times smaller than the moduli of 5 mol-% PEG-DA cross-linked microgels. Resistive pulse sensing experiments demonstrate that microgels prepared at 75 and 80°C without PEG-DA are able to deform significantly to pass through nanopores that are smaller than the microgel size. Additionally, we found that polymer network flexibility of microgels is a useful tool to control the formation of particle dewetting patterns. This offers a promising new avenue for build-up of 2D self-assembled particle structures with patterned chemical and mechanical properties."
https://openalex.org/W2738986512,"A recent study reported that heat stress stimulates osteogenesis in an in vivo rat model using alginate gel and magnetite cationic liposomes. However, for clinical use, the efficacy for promoting osteogenesis needs to be investigated using clinically approved materials, and preferably with animals larger than rats. The aim of this study was to evaluate multiple heat stimuli-triggered osteogenesis in rat tibial defect models using already clinically applicable materials (Resovist® and REGENOS®) and determine the efficacy also in the rabbit. Fifty-eight rats and 10 rabbits were divided into two groups, respectively, with or without hyperthermia treatment at 45°C for 15 min. (hyperthermia; 20 rats once a week, 8 rats three times a week, 5 rabbits once a week, control; 30 rats and 5 rabbits). Micro-CT assessment at 4 weeks revealed that a significantly stimulated osteogenesis was observed in the once a week group of both rats and rabbits as compared to the control group (p = 0.018 and 0.036, respectively). In contrast, the three times a week group did not show enhanced osteogenesis. Histological examination and image analysis showed consistent results in which the area of mineralized bone formation in the once a week hyperthermia group was significantly increased compared with that in the control group at four weeks (rat; p = 0.026, rabbit; p = 0.031). Newly formed bone was observed in the grafted materials from the periphery toward the center, and more osteoclasts were found in the once a week group. Heat stress also induced enhanced alkaline phosphatase expression in cultured osteoblastic cells, MC3T3, in vitro (p = 0.03). On the other hand, heat stress had no obvious effects on chondrogenic differentiation using ATDC5 cells. Our study demonstrates that heat-stimuli with clinically applicable novel heating materials can promote significant osteogenesis, and may thus be a promising treatment option for diseases associated with bone defects."
https://openalex.org/W2738927854,"Background Durability of vaccine-elicited immune responses is one of the key determinants for vaccine success. Our aim is to develop a vaccination strategy against the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), which induces protective and durable CD8+ T-cell responses. The central theorem of our approach is to focus T cells on highly conserved regions of the HIV-1 proteome and this is achieved through the use of the first-generation conserved vaccine immunogen HIVconsv. This immunogen vectored by plasmid DNA, simian adenovirus and poxvirus MVA was tested in healthy, HIV-1-negative adults in UK and induced high magnitudes of HIVconsv-specific plurifunctional CD8+ T cells capable of in vitro HIV-1 inhibition. Here, we assessed the durability of these responses. Methods Vaccine recipients in trial HIV-CORE 002 were invited to provide a blood sample at 1 and 2 years after vaccination. Their PBMCs were tested in IFN-γ ELISPOT, 25-analyte Luminex, CFSE proliferation and intracellular cytokine staining assays, the last enhanced by HLA-peptide dextramer analysis. Results 12/12 (1 year) and 8/8 (2 years) returning subjects had median (range) of 990 (150–2495) and 763 (70–1745) IFN-γ SFU/106 PBMC specific for HIVconsv, respectively, and recognized 5 (1–6) out of 6 peptide pools at 2 years. Over one-half of the HIVconsv–specific cells expressed at least 3 functions IFN-γ, TNF-α and CD107a, and were capable of proliferation. Among dextramer-reactive cells, naïve, transitional, effector and terminally differentiated memory subsets were similarly represented. Conclusions First generation HIVconsv vaccine induced human T cells, which were plurifunctional and persisted for at least 2 years. Trial registration ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01151319"
https://openalex.org/W2737364234,"Primary and secondary structural data from the internal transcribed spacer two (ITS2) have been used extensively for diversity studies of many different eukaryotic organisms, including the green algae. Ease of amplification is due, at least in part, to the fact that ITS2 is part of the tandemly-repeated rRNA array. The potential confounding influence of intragenomic variability has yet to be addressed except in a few organisms. Moreover, few of the assessments of intragenomic variation have taken advantage of the deep sequencing capacity of sequence-by-synthesis protocols. We present results from our adaptation of the 16S Metagenomics Sequencing Library Preparation/Illumina protocol for deep sequencing of the ITS2 genes in selected isolates of the green algal genus, Haematococcus. Deep sequencing yielded from just under 20,000 to more than 500,000 merged reads, outpacing results from recent pyrosequencing efforts. Furthermore, a conservative evaluation of these data revealed a range of three to six ITS2 sequence haplotypes (defined as unique sets of nucleotide polymorphisms) across the taxon sampling. The frequency of the dominant haplotype ranged from 0.35 to 0.98. In all but two cases, the haplotype with the greatest frequency corresponded to a sequence obtained by the Sanger method using PCR templates. Our data also show that results from the sequencing-by-synthesis approach are reproducible. In addition to advancing our understanding of ribosomal RNA variation, the results of this investigation will allow us to begin testing hypotheses regarding the maintenance of homogeneity across multi-copy genes."
https://openalex.org/W2737653458,"Current knowledge on the biological responses of freshwater fish under projected scenarios of climate change remains limited. Here, we examine differences in the protein configuration of two endemic Iberian freshwater fish species, Squalius carolitertii and the critically endangered S. torgalensis that inhabit in the Atlantic-type northern and in the Mediterranean-type southwestern regions, respectively. We performed protein structure modeling of fourteen genes linked to protein folding, energy metabolism, circadian rhythms and immune responses. Structural differences in proteins between the two species were found for HSC70, FKBP52, HIF1α and GPB1. For S. torgalensis, besides structural differences, we found higher thermostability for two proteins (HSP90 and GBP1), which can be advantageous in a warmer environment. Additionally, we investigated how these species might respond to projected scenarios of 3° climate change warming, acidification (ΔpH = -0.4), and their combined effects. Significant changes in gene expression were observed in response to all treatments, particularly under the combined warming and acidification. While S. carolitertii presented changes in gene expression for multiple proteins related to folding (hsp90aa1, hsc70, fkbp4 and stip1), only one such gene was altered in S. torgalensis (stip1). However, S. torgalensis showed a greater capacity for energy production under both the acidification and combined scenarios by increasing cs gene expression and maintaining ldha gene expression in muscle. Overall, these findings suggest that S. torgalensis is better prepared to cope with projected climate change. Worryingly, under the simulated scenarios, disturbances to circadian rhythm and immune system genes (cry1aa, per1a and gbp1) raise concerns for the persistence of both species, highlighting the need to consider multi-stressor effects when evaluating climate change impacts upon fish. This work also highlights that assessments of the potential of endangered freshwater species to cope with environmental change are crucial to help decision-makers adopt future conservation strategies."
https://openalex.org/W2736592783,"One of the fundamental patterns in macroecology is the increase in the number of observed taxa with size of sampled area. For microbes, the shape of this relationship remains less clear. The current study assessed the diversity of aquatic fungi, by the traditional approach based on conidial morphology (captures reproducing aquatic hyphomycetes) and next generation sequencing (NGS; captures other fungi as well), on graded sizes of alder leaves (0.6 to 13.6 cm2). Leaves were submerged in two streams in geographically distant locations: the Oliveira Stream in Portugal and the Boss Brook in Canada. Decay rates of alder leaves and fungal sporulation rates did not differ between streams. Fungal biomass was higher in Boss Brook than in Oliveira Stream, and in both streams almost 100% of the reads belonged to active fungal taxa. In general, larger leaf areas tended to harbour more fungi, but these findings were not consistent between techniques. Morphospecies-based diversity increased with leaf area in Boss Brook, but not in Oliveira Stream; metabarcoding data showed an opposite trend. The higher resolution of metabarcoding resulted in steeper taxa-accumulation curves than morphospecies-based assessments (fungal conidia morphology). Fungal communities assessed by metabarcoding were spatially structured by leaf area in both streams. Metabarcoding promises greater resolution to assess biodiversity patterns in aquatic fungi and may be more accurate for assessing taxa-area relationships and local to global diversity ratios."
https://openalex.org/W2736426283,"Carnivory in pitcher plants generally involves digestion of prey, by the plant itself, by symbionts, or both. While symbionts appear to be important in the digestion of prey in Sarracenia purpurea, the importance of pitcher-derived enzymes is less well documented. Our goal was to reduce microbial numbers in pitcher fluid in order to measure the acid phosphatase activity attributable to the pitchers themselves. Preliminary experiments indicated that various antibiotics were minimally effective at reducing microbial populations and that antibiotic-resistant microbes were easily cultured from pitcher fluid. Consequently, we measured the abundance of culturable microbes in every sample taken for the measurement of acid phosphatase activity. Pitchers fed with one sterilized ant had higher levels of acid phosphatase activity than unfed pitchers. Older pitchers were more responsive to feeding than young pitchers. Pitchers with high levels of microbes (on Day 5) had higher acid phosphatase activity than pitchers with low levels of microbes. However, fed pitchers were not more likely to have higher microbe levels and microbe levels were not related to pitcher age. When fluid samples from inside the pitcher were compared to appropriate controls incubated outside the pitcher, acid phosphatase activity was higher inside the pitcher. Results from the feeding experiments are consistent with a primary role of microbes in the digestion of prey in pitchers of S. purpurea. However, the relationship between pitcher age and enzyme activity is not a function of microbes in the pitcher fluid and may depend on enzymes produced by the plant. Our methods would not detect microbes embedded on the inner surface of the pitcher; and if they survived the alcohol rinse and antibiotics, we cannot rule out microbes as the source of the relationship between pitcher age and acid phosphatase activity."

The aim of this study was to identify factors associated with the life-sustaining treatment restriction and to explore if CCI contributes to explaining decisions to restrict life-sustaining treatment in the ICU at a university hospital in Norway from 2007 to 2009.Patients' Simplified Acute Physiology Score II (SAPS II), age, sex, type of admission, and length of hospital stay prior to being admitted to the unit were recorded. We retrospectively registered the CCI for all patients based on the medical records prior to the index stay. A multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to assess factors associated with treatment restriction during the ICU stay.We included 936 patients, comprising 685 (73%) medical, 204 (22%) unscheduled and 47 (5%) scheduled surgical patients. Treatment restriction was experienced by 241 (26%) patients during their ICU stay. The variables that were significantly associated with treatment restriction in multivariable analysis were older age (odds ratio [OR] = 1.48 per 10 years, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.28-1.72 per 10 years), higher SAPS II (OR = 1.05, 95% CI = 1.04-1.07) and CCI values relative to the reference of CCI = 0: CCI = 2 (OR = 2.08, 95% CI = 1.20-3.61) and CCI≥3 (OR = 2.72, 95% CI = 1.65-4.47).In multivariable analysis, older age, greater illness severity after 24 h in the ICU and greater comorbidity at hospital admission were independently associated with subsequent life-sustaining treatment restriction. The CCI score contributed additional information independent of the SAPS II illness severity rating."

In this report we present a detailed characterization of a patient-derived OM, together with a description of cell cultures obtained from the OM.

https://openalex.org/W2738751947,"Mucin-type O-glycosylation is initiated by the UDP-GalNAc polypeptide:N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase (GalNAc-T) family of enzymes. Their activity results in the GalNAc α1-O-Thr/Ser structure, termed the Tn antigen, which is further decorated with additional sugars. In neoplastic cells, the Tn antigen is often overexpressed. Because O-glycosylation is controlled by the activity of GalNAc-Ts, their regulation is of great interest. Previous reports suggest that growth factors, EGF or PDGF, induce Golgi complex-to-endoplasmic reticulum (ER) relocation of both GalNAc-Ts and Tn antigen in HeLa cells, offering a mechanism for Tn antigen overexpression termed “GALA”. However, we were unable to reproduce these findings. Upon treatment of HeLa cells with either EGF or PDGF we observed no change in the co-localization of endogenous GalNAc-T1, GalNAc-T2 or Tn antigen with the Golgi complex marker TGN46. There was also no enhancement of localization with the ER marker calnexin. We conclude that growth factors do not cause redistribution of GalNAc-Ts from the Golgi complex to the ER in HeLa cells."
https://openalex.org/W2736375120,"The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that approximately 240 million people in 78 countries require treatment for schistosomiasis, an endemic disease caused by trematodes of the genus Schistosoma. In Brazil, Schistosoma mansoni is the only species representative of the genus whose passage through an invertebrate host, snails of the genus Biomphalaria, is obligatory before infecting a mammalian host, including humans. The availability of the genome and transcriptome of B. glabrata makes studying the regulation of gene expression, particularly the regulation of miRNA and piRNA processing pathway genes, possible. This might assist in better understanding the biology of B. glabrata as well as its relationship to the parasite S. mansoni. Some aspects of this interaction are still poorly explored, including the participation of non-coding small RNAs, such as miRNAs and piRNAs, with lengths varying from 18 to 30 nucleotides in mature form, which are potent regulators of gene expression. Using bioinformatics tools and quantitative PCR, we characterized and validated the miRNA and piRNA processing pathway genes in B. glabrata. In silico analyses showed that genes involved in miRNA and piRNA pathways were highly conserved in protein domain distribution, catalytic site residue conservation and phylogenetic analysis. Our study showed differential expression of putative Argonaute, Drosha, Piwi, Exportin-5 and Tudor genes at different snail developmental stages and during infection with S. mansoni, suggesting that the machinery is required for miRNA and piRNA processing in B. glabrata at all stages. These data suggested that the silencing pathway mediated by miRNAs and piRNAs can interfere in snail biology throughout the life cycle of the snail, thereby influencing the B. glabrata/S. mansoni interaction. Further studies are needed to confirm the participation of the small RNA processing pathway proteins in the parasite/host relationship, mainly the effective participation of small RNAs in regulating their target genes."
https://openalex.org/W2738680359,"Whole transcriptome analyses have revealed a large number of novel long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs). Although accumulating evidence demonstrates that lncRNAs play important roles in regulating gene expression, the detailed mechanisms of action of most lncRNAs remain unclear. We previously reported that a novel class of lncRNAs with a short half-life (t1/2 < 4 h) in HeLa cells, termed short-lived non-coding transcripts (SLiTs), are closely associated with physiological and pathological functions. In this study, we focused on 26 SLiTs and nuclear-enriched abundant lncRNA, MALAT1(t1/2 of 7.6 h in HeLa cells) in neural stem cells (NSCs) derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells, and identified four SLiTs (TUG1, GAS5, FAM222-AS1, and SNHG15) that were affected by the following typical chemical stresses (oxidative stress, heavy metal stress and protein synthesis stress). We also found the expression levels of LINC00152 (t1/2 of 2.1 h in NSCs), MALAT1 (t1/2 of 1.8 h in NSCs), and their neighboring genes were elevated proportionally to the chemical doses. Moreover, we confirmed that the overexpression of LINC00152 or MALAT1 upregulated the expressions of their neighboring genes even in the absence of chemical stress. These results reveal that LINC00152 and MALAT1 modulate their neighboring genes, and thus provide a deeper understanding of the functions of lncRNAs."
https://openalex.org/W2736631385,"In nature, plants are often exposed to multiple stress factors at the same time. Yet, little is known about how plants modulate their physiology to counteract simultaneous abiotic and biotic stresses, such as soil salinity and insect herbivory. In this study, insect performance bioassays, phytohormone measurements, quantification of transcripts, and protein determination were employed to study the phenotypic variations of two alfalfa (Medicago sativa) cultivars in response to insect Spodoptera litura feeding under normal and salt stress condition. When being cultivated in normal soil, the salt-tolerant alfalfa cultivar Zhongmu-1 exhibited lower insect resistance than did the salt-sensitive cultivar Xinjiang Daye. Under salinity stress, the defense responses of Xinjiang Daye were repressed, whereas Zhongmu-1 did not show changes in resistance levels. It is likely that salinity influenced the resistance of Xinjiang Daye through suppressing the accumulation of jasmonic acid-isoleucine (JA-Ile), which is the bioactive hormone inducing herbivore defense responses, leading to attenuated trypsin proteinase inhibitor (TPI) activity. Furthermore, exogenous ABA supplementation suppressed the insect herbivory-induced JA/JA-Ile accumulation and levels of JAR1 (jasmonate resistant 1) and TPI, and further decreased the resistance of Xinjiang Daye, whereas Zhongmu-1 showed very little response to the increased ABA level. We propose a mechanism, in which high levels of abscisic acid induced by salt treatment may affect the expression levels of JAR1 and consequently decrease JA-Ile accumulation and thus partly suppress the defense of Xinjiang Daye against insects under salt stress. This study provides new insight into the mechanism by which alfalfa responds to concurrent abiotic and biotic stresses."
https://openalex.org/W2737374886,"Protein half-life is an important feature of protein homeostasis (proteostasis). The increasing number of in vivo and in vitro studies using high throughput proteomics provide estimates of the protein half-lives in tissues and cells. However, protein half-lives in cells and tissues are different. Due to the resource requirements for researching tissues, more data is available from cellular studies than tissues. We have designed a multivariate linear model for predicting protein half-life in tissue from its cellular properties. Inputs to the model are cellular half-life, abundance, intrinsically disordered sequences, and transcriptional and translational rates. Before the modeling, we determined substructures in the data using the relative distance from the regression line of the protein half-lives in tissues and cells, identifying three separate clusters. The model was trained on and applied to predict protein half-lives from murine liver, brain and heart tissues. In each tissue type we observed similar prediction patterns of protein half-lives. We found that the model provides the best results when there is a strong correlation between tissue and cell culture protein half-lives. Additionally, we clustered the protein half-lives to determine variations in correlation coefficients between the protein half-lives in the tissue versus in cell culture. The clusters identify strongly and weakly correlated protein half-lives, further improves the overall prediction and identifies sub groupings which exhibit specific characteristics. The model described herein, is generalizable to other data sets and has been implemented in a freely available R code."

https://openalex.org/W2739048122,"Reaching movements are comprised of the coordinated action across multiple joints. The human skeleton is redundant for this task because different joint configurations can lead to the same endpoint in space. How do people learn to use combinations of joints that maximize success in goal-directed motor tasks? To answer this question, we used a 3-degree-of-freedom manipulandum to measure shoulder, elbow and wrist joint movements during reaching in a plane. We tested whether a shift in the relative contribution of the wrist and elbow joints to a reaching movement could be learned by an implicit reinforcement regime. Unknown to the participants, we decreased the task success for certain joint configurations (wrist flexion or extension, respectively) by adding random variability to the endpoint feedback. In return, the opposite wrist postures were rewarded in the two experimental groups (flexion and extension group). We found that the joint configuration slowly shifted towards movements that provided more control over the endpoint and hence higher task success. While the overall learning was significant, only the group that was guided to extend the wrist joint more during the movement showed substantial learning. Importantly, all changes in movement pattern occurred independent of conscious awareness of the experimental manipulation. These findings suggest that the motor system is generally sensitive to its output variability and can optimize joint-space solutions that minimize task-relevant output variability. We discuss biomechanical biases (e.g. joint's range of movement) that could impose hurdles to the learning process."

This study was aimed to determine the importance of gender in the association between self-rated health and mortality among older people in Santiago, Chile. Methods A 10 year follow-up of 1066 people aged 60 or more, from the Chilean cohort of the Study of Health, Ageing and Well-Being. Self-rated health was assessed in face to face interviews through a single general question, along with socio-demographic and health status information. Cox proportional hazards and flexible parametric models for survival analyses were employed. Results By the end of follow-up, 30.7% of women and 39.4% of men died. Adjusted hazard ratio of poor self-rated health, compared to good self-rated health, was 1.92(95% CI 1.29–2.86). In models stratified by gender, an increased risk of mortality was observed among women who rated their health as poor (HR = 2.21, 95% CI 1.43–3.40), but not among men (HR = 1.04, 95% CI 0.58–1.86). Age was associated with mortality in both groups; for men, functional limitation and underweight were also risk factors and obesity was a protective factor. Conclusions Compared to older women who rated their health as good, older women who rated their health as poor had a 2 fold increased risk of mortality over the subsequent 10 years. These findings stress the importance of considering a gender perspective into health programmes, including those focused on older people, in order to address the different elements that increase, on the long run, the risk of dying among older women and men."
https://openalex.org/W2738399548,"CD4+ T cells recruited to the liver play a key role in the pathogenesis of ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury. The mechanism of their activation during alloantigen-independent I/R is not completely understood. We hypothesized that liver-resident dendritic cells (DCs) interact with CD4+ T cells in the postischemic liver and that modulation of DCs or T-cell–DC interactions attenuates liver inflammation. In mice, warm hepatic I/R (90/120–240 min) was induced. Tolerogenic DCs were generated in situ by pretreatment of animals with the vitamin D analog paricalcitol. A mAb-CD44 was used for blockade of CD4+ T-cell–DC interactions. As shown by 2-photon in vivo microscopy as well as confocal microscopy, CD4+ T cells were closely colocalized with DCs in the postischemic liver. Pretreatment with paricalcitol attenuated I/R-induced maturation of DCs (flow cytometry), CD4+ T-cell recruitment into the liver (intravital microscopy), and hepatocellular/microvascular damage (intravital microscopy, alanine aminotransferase/aspartate aminotransferase, histology). However, interruption of T-cell–DC interaction increased proinflammatory DC maturation and even enhanced tissue damage. Simultaneous treatment with an anti-CD44mAb completely abolished the beneficial effect of paricalcitol on T-cell migration and tissue injury. Our study demonstrates for the first time that hepatic DCs interact with CD4+ T cells in the postischemic liver in vivo; modulation of DCs and/or generation of tolerogenic DCs attenuates intrahepatic CD4+ T-cell recruitment and reduces I/R injury; and interruption of CD44-dependent CD4+ T-cell–DC interactions enhances tissue injury by preventing the modulatory effect of hepatic DCs on T cells, especially type 1 T helper effector cells. Thus, hepatic DCs are strongly involved in the promotion of CD4+ T-cell–dependent postischemic liver inflammation.—Funken, D., Ishikawa-Ankerhold, H., Uhl, B., Lerchenberger, M., Rentsch, M., Mayr, D., Massberg, S., Werner, J., Khandoga, A.

https://openalex.org/W2738728465,"Background The aim of this study was to evaluate whether MP [11C]Acetate PET-MRI enables an accurate differentiation of benign and malignant prostate tumors as well as local and distant staging. Materials and methods Fifty-six consecutive patients fulfilling the following criteria were included in this IRB-approved prospective study: elevated PSA levels or suspicious findings at digital rectal examination or TRUS; and histopathological verification. All patients underwent MP [11C]Acetate PET-MRI of the prostate performed on separate scanners with PET/CT using [11C]Acetate and 3T MP MR imaging. Appropriate statistical tests were used to determine diagnostic accuracy, local and distant staging. Results MP imaging with two MRI parameters (T2w and DWI) achieved the highest sensitivity, specificity, and diagnostic accuracy of 95%, 68.8%, and 88%, with an AUC of 0.82 for primary PCa detection. Neither assessments with a single parameter (AUC, 0.54–0.79), nor different combinations with up to five parameters (AUC, 0.67–0.79) achieved equally good results. MP [11C]Acetate PET-MRI improved local staging with a sensitivity, specificity, and diagnostic accuracy of 100%, 96%, and 97% compared to MRI alone with 72.2%, 100%, and 95.5%. MP [11C]Acetate PET-MRI correctly detected osseous and liver metastases in five patients. Conclusions MP [11C]Acetate PET-MRI merges morphologic with functional information, and allows insights into tumor biology. MP [11C]Acetate PET-MRI with two MRI-derived parameters (T2 and DWI) yields the highest diagnostic accuracy. The addition of more parameters does not improve diagnostic accuracy of primary PCa detection. MP [11C]Acetate PET-MRI facilitates improved local and distant staging, providing “one-stop” staging in patients with primary PCa, and therefore has the potential to improve therapy. Patient summary In this report we investigated MP [11C]Acetate PET-MRI for detection, local and distant staging of prostate cancer. We demonstrate that MP [11C]Acetate PET-MRI with two MRI-derived parameters (T2 and DWI) achieves the best diagnostic accuracy for primary prostate cancer detection and that MP [11C]Acetate PET-MRI enables an improved local and distant staging."

This method could be rapidly and successfully used for genome engineering, including deletions, insertions, replacements, and point mutations, without inactivation of the methyl-directed mismatch repair (MMR) system and plasmid cloning. The method we describe here facilitates positive genome-edited recombinants with selection efficiencies ranging from 57 to 92%. Using our method, we increased lycopene production (3.4-fold) by replacing the ribosome binding site (RBS) of the rate-limiting gene (dxs) in the 1-deoxy-D-xylulose-5-phosphate (DXP) biosynthesis pathway with a strong RBS. Thus, this method could be used to achieve scarless, proficient, and targeted genome editing for engineering E. coli strains."
https://openalex.org/W2736809200,"Thiazide derivatives including Hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) represent the most common treatment of mild to moderate hypertension. Thiazides initially enhance diuresis via inhibition of the kidney Na+-Cl- Cotransporter (NCC). However, chronic volume depletion and diuresis are minimal while lowered blood pressure (BP) is maintained on thiazides. Thus, a vasodilator action of thiazides is proposed, likely via Ca2+-activated K+ (BK) channels in vascular smooth muscles. This study ascertains the role of volume depletion induced by salt restriction or salt wasting in NCC KO mice on the non-diuretic hypotensive action of HCTZ. HCTZ (20mg/kg s.c.) lowered BP in 1) NCC KO on a salt restricted diet but not with normal diet; 2) in volume depleted but not in volume resuscitated pendrin/NCC dKO mice; the BP reduction occurs without any enhancement in salt excretion or reduction in cardiac output. HCTZ still lowered BP following treatment of NCC KO on salt restricted diet with paxilline (8 mg/kg, i.p.), a BK channel blocker, and in BK KO and BK/NCC dKO mice on salt restricted diet. In aortic rings from NCC KO mice on normal and low salt diet, HCTZ did not alter and minimally decreased maximal phenylephrine contraction, respectively, while contractile sensitivity remained unchanged. These results demonstrate 1) the non-diuretic hypotensive effects of thiazides are augmented with volume depletion and 2) that the BP reduction is likely the result of HCTZ inhibition of vasoconstriction through a pathway dependent on factors present in vivo, is unrelated to BK channel activation, and involves processes associated with intravascular volume depletion."

A Fab phage display library was constructed with PBMC from the alloimmunized macaque and panned to isolate an antibody that binds to Mamu-A1*001 but not to other common rhesus macaque MHC class I molecules. The isolated antibody distinguishes PBMC from Mamu-A1*001-positive and -negative macaques. Additionally, the Mamu-A1*001-specific antibody binds the cynomolgus macaque MHC class I ortholog Mafa-A1*001:01 but not variants Mafa-A1*001:02/03, indicating a high degree of binding specificity. The Mamu-A1*001-specific antibody will be useful for identifying Mamu-A1*001-positive rhesus macaques, for detecting Mamu-A1*001-positive cells in populations of Mamu-A1*001-negative cells, and for examining disease processes that alter expression of Mamu-A1*001 on cell surfaces. Moreover, the alloimmunization process we describe will be useful for isolating additional MHC allomorph-specific monoclonal antibodies or antibodies against other polymorphic host proteins which are difficult to isolate with traditional technologies."
https://openalex.org/W2736503502,"Grain weight, which is controlled by quantitative trait loci (QTLs), is one of the most important determinants of rice yield. Although many QTLs for grain weight have been identified, little is known about how different alleles in different QTLs coordinate to determine grain weight. In the present study, six grain-weight-QTLs were detected in seven mapping populations (two F2, one F3, and four recombinant inbred lines) developed by crossing 'Lemont', a United States japonica variety, with 'Yangdao 4', a Chinese indica variety. In each of the six loci, one allele from one parent increased grain weight and one allele from another parent decreased it. Thus, the 12 alleles at the six QTLs were subjected to regression analysis to examine whether they acted additively across loci leading to a linear relationship between the predicted breeding value of QTL and phenotype. Results suggested that a combination of the 12 alleles determined grain weight. In addition, plants carrying more grain-weight-increasing alleles had heavier grains than those carrying more grain-weight-decreasing alleles. This trend was consistent in the seven mapping populations. Thus, these six QTLs might be used in marker-assisted selection of grain weight, by stacking different grain-weight-increasing or -decreasing alleles."
https://openalex.org/W2738261022,"The imprinting of the mouse Peg3 domain is controlled through a 4-kb genomic region encompassing the bidirectional promoter and 1st exons of Peg3 and Usp29. In the current study, this ICR was inverted to test its orientation dependency for the transcriptional and imprinting control of the Peg3 domain. The inversion resulted in the exchange of promoters and 1st exons between Peg3 and Usp29. Paternal transmission of this inversion caused 10-fold down-regulation of Peg3 and 2-fold up-regulation of Usp29 in neonatal heads, consistent with its original promoter strength in each direction. The paternal transmission also resulted in reduced body size among the animals, which was likely contributed by the dramatic down-regulation of Peg3. Transmission through either allele caused no changes in the DNA methylation and imprinting status of the Peg3 domain except that Zfp264 became bi-allelic through the maternal transmission. Overall, the current study suggests that the orientation of the Peg3-ICR may play no role in its allele-specific DNA methylation, but very critical for the transcriptional regulation of the entire imprinted domain."
https://openalex.org/W2737539086,"Smoking increases the risk of pregnancy complications such as spontaneous abortion and low birth weight (LBW). By cigarette smoke exposure (gestational day, GD3-17), normal-litter-size pregnancy with low birth weight (NP-LBW) and small-litter-size pregnancy with normal birth weight (SP-NBW) in rats were induced. The placental weight in SP-NBW was twice the weight of the normal in contrast with the smaller placenta in NP-LBW. Compared with the normal, placental efficiency (expressed as fetus-to-placenta weight ratio) and placental vascularisation were significantly decreased in smoke exposed placentas with more obvious decrease in SP-NBW. For NP-LBW, decreased placental vascularisation was due to decreased labyrinth vascularisation which was caused by both decreased number density and diameter of fetal capillary. For SP-NBW, decreased placental vascularisation was due to reduced proportion of labyrinth in placenta and decreased labyrinth vascularisation which was caused by decreased fetal capillary number density. Real time RT-PCR analysis showed a tendency for decreased placental mRNA level of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), angiopoietin-1 (Ang1) and tyrosine kinase receptor-2 (Tie2) in NP-LBW(P<0.1), and the tendency became obvious in SP-NBW(P<0.05). A tendency for decreased placental mRNA level of fms-like tyrosine kinase-1(Flt1) and angiopoietin-2 (Ang2) was also observed in SP-LBW(P<0.1). Our data demonstrated the synergistic negative effect of gestational smoke-exposure and small litter size on placental efficiency, placental vascularisation and placental angiogenic growth factor mRNA expression in rat."
https://openalex.org/W2738940107,"Genomic selection has been widely used for complex quantitative trait in farm animals. Estimations of breeding values for slaughter traits are most important to beef cattle industry, and it is worthwhile to investigate prediction accuracies of genomic selection for these traits. In this study, we assessed genomic predictive abilities for average daily gain weight (ADG), live weight (LW), carcass weight (CW), dressing percentage (DP), lean meat percentage (LMP) and retail meat weight (RMW) using Illumina Bovine 770K SNP Beadchip in Chinese Simmental cattle. To evaluate the abilities of prediction, marker effects were estimated using genomic BLUP (GBLUP) and three parallel Bayesian models, including multiple chains parallel BayesA, BayesB and BayesCπ (PBayesA, PBayesB and PBayesCπ). Training set and validation set were divided by random allocation, and the predictive accuracies were evaluated using 5-fold cross validations. We found the accuracies of genomic predictions ranged from 0.195±0.084 (GBLUP for LMP) to 0.424±0.147 (PBayesB for CW). The average accuracies across traits were 0.327±0.085 (GBLUP), 0.335±0.063 (PBayesA), 0.347±0.093 (PBayesB) and 0.334±0.077 (PBayesCπ), respectively. Notably, parallel Bayesian models were more accurate than GBLUP across six traits. Our study suggested that genomic selections with multiple chains parallel Bayesian models are feasible for slaughter traits in Chinese Simmental cattle. The estimations of direct genomic breeding values using parallel Bayesian methods can offer important insights into improving prediction accuracy at young ages and may also help to identify superior candidates in breeding programs."
https://openalex.org/W2739048662,"Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSv) infection causes a devastating economic impact to the swine industry. Active surveillance is routinely conducted in many swine herds to demonstrate freedom from PRRSv infection. The design of efficient active surveillance sampling schemes is challenging because optimum surveillance strategies may differ depending on infection status, herd structure, management, or resources for conducting sampling. Here, we present an open web-based application, named 'OptisampleTM', designed to optimize herd sampling strategies to substantiate freedom of infection considering also costs of testing. In addition to herd size, expected prevalence, test sensitivity, and desired level of confidence, the model takes into account the presumed risk of pathogen introduction between samples, the structure of the herd, and the process to select the samples over time. We illustrate the functionality and capacity of 'OptisampleTM' through its application to active surveillance of PRRSv in hypothetical swine herds under disparate epidemiological situations. Diverse sampling schemes were simulated and compared for each herd to identify effective strategies at low costs. The model results show that to demonstrate freedom from disease, it is important to consider both the epidemiological situation of the herd and the sample selected. The approach illustrated here for PRRSv may be easily extended to other animal disease surveillance systems using the web-based application available at http://stemma.ahc.umn.edu/optisample."
https://openalex.org/W2738340330,"The abuse of anabolic androgenic steroids (AAS) has been considered a major public health problem during decades. Supraphysiological doses of AAS may lead to a variety of neuroendocrine problems. Precisely, the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis is one of the body systems that is mainly influenced by steroidal hormones. Fluctuations of the hormonal milieu result in alterations of reproductive function, which are made through changes in hypothalamic neurons expressing gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH). In fact, previous studies have shown that AAS modulate the activity of these neurons through steroid-sensitive afferents. To increase knowledge about the cellular mechanisms induced by AAS in GnRH neurons, we performed proteomic analyses of the murine hypothalamic GT1-7 cell line after exposure to 17α-methyltestosterone (17α-meT; 1 μM). These cells represent a good model for studying regulatory processes because they exhibit the typical characteristics of GnRH neurons, and respond to compounds that modulate GnRH in vivo. Two-dimensional difference in gel electrophoresis (2D-DIGE) and mass spectrometry analyses identified a total of 17 different proteins that were significantly affected by supraphysiological levels of AAS. Furthermore, pathway analyses showed that modulated proteins were mainly associated to glucose metabolism, drug detoxification, stress response and cell cycle. Validation of many of these proteins, such as GSTM1, ERH, GAPDH, PEBP1 and PDIA6, were confirmed by western blotting. We further demonstrated that AAS exposure decreased expression of estrogen receptors and GnRH, while two important signaling pathway proteins p-ERK, and p-p38, were modulated. Our results suggest that steroids have the capacity to directly affect the neuroendocrine system by modulating key cellular processes for the control of reproductive function."
