https://openalex.org/W2889166715,"The problem that passengers are hard to take taxis while empty driving rate is high widely exists under the traditional taxi operation mode. The implementation of taxi carpooling mode can alleviate the problem in a certain extent. The objective of this study is to optimize the taxi carpooling path. Firstly, the taxi carpooling path optimization model with single objective and its extended model with multiple objectives are built respectively. Then, the single objective path optimization model of taxi carpooling is solved based on the improved single objective genetic algorithm, and the multiple-objective path optimization model of taxi carpooling is solved based on the improved multiple-objective genetic algorithm. Finally, a case study is carried out based on a road network with 24 nodes. The case study results show the path optimization models and algorithms of taxi carpooling proposed in the paper can quickly get the taxi carpooling path, and can increase the income of taxi driver while reduce the cost for passengers."

We examined associations between PMNS (height, weight and body mass index- BMI) and offspring growth during the first 1000 days. We used prospective cohort data from a randomized-controlled trial of preconception micronutrient supplementation in Vietnam, PRECONCEPT (n = 1409). Poisson regression models were used to examine associations between PMNS and risk of offspring stunting (<-2 HAZ) at 2 years. We used path analytic models to examine associations with PMNS on fetal growth (ultrasound measurements) and offspring HAZ at birth and 2 years. All models were adjusted for child age, sex, gestational weight gain, education, socioeconomic status and treatment group. A third of women had a preconception height < 150cm or weight < 43 kg. Women with preconception height < 150 cm or a weight < 43 kg were at increased risk of having a stunted child at 2 years (incident risk ratio IRR: 1.85, 95% CI 1.51-2.28; IRR 1.35, 95% CI 1.10-1.65, respectively). While the traditional low BMI cut-off (< 18.5 kg/m2) was not significant, lower BMI cut-offs (< 17.5 kg/m2 or < 18.0 kg/m2) were significantly associated with 1.3 times increased risk of child stunting. In path models, PMNS were positively associated with fetal growth (ultrasound measurements) and offspring HAZ at birth and 2 years. For each 1 standard deviation (SD) increase in maternal height and weight, offspring HAZ at 2 years increased by 0.30 SD and 0.23 SD, respectively. In conclusion, PMNS influences both offspring linear growth and risk of stunting across the first 1000 days. These findings underscore the importance of expanding the scope of current policies and strategies to include the preconception period in order to reduce child stunting."
https://openalex.org/W2889014927,"Climate change communication efforts grounded in the information deficit model have largely failed to close the gap between scientific and public understanding of the risks posed by climate change. In response, simulations have been proposed to enable people to learn for themselves about this complex and politically charged topic. Here we assess the impact of a widely-used simulation, World Climate, which combines a socially and emotionally engaging role-play with interactive exploration of climate change science through the C-ROADS climate simulation model. Participants take on the roles of delegates to the UN climate negotiations and are challenged to create an agreement that meets international climate goals. Their decisions are entered into C-ROADS, which provides immediate feedback about expected global climate impacts, enabling them to learn about climate change while experiencing the social dynamics of negotiations. We assess the impact of World Climate by analyzing pre- and post-survey results from >2,000 participants in 39 sessions in eight nations. We find statistically significant gains in three areas: (i) knowledge of climate change causes, dynamics and impacts; (ii) affective engagement including greater feelings of urgency and hope; and (iii) a desire to learn and do more about climate change. Contrary to the deficit model, gains in urgency were associated with gains in participants' desire to learn more and intent to act, while gains in climate knowledge were not. Gains were just as strong among American participants who oppose government regulation of free markets-a political ideology that has been linked to climate change denial in the US-suggesting the simulation's potential to reach across political divides. The results indicate that World Climate offers a climate change communication tool that enables people to learn and feel for themselves, which together have the potential to motivate action informed by science."
https://openalex.org/W2889195527,"Physical inactivity is a primary contributor to the obesity epidemic, but may be promoted or hindered by environmental factors. To examine how cumulative environmental quality may modify the inactivity-obesity relationship, we conducted a cross-sectional study by linking county-level Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System data with the Environmental Quality Index (EQI), a composite measure of five environmental domains (air, water, land, built, sociodemographic) across all U.S. counties. We estimated the county-level association (N = 3,137 counties) between 2009 age-adjusted leisure-time physical inactivity (LTPIA) and 2010 age-adjusted obesity from BRFSS across EQI tertiles using multi-level linear regression, with a random intercept for state, adjusted for percent minority and rural-urban status. We modelled overall and sex-specific estimates, reporting prevalence differences (PD) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). In the overall population, the PD increased from best (PD = 0.341 (95% CI: 0.287, 0.396)) to worst (PD = 0.645 (95% CI: 0.599, 0.690)) EQI tertile. We observed similar trends in males from best (PD = 0.244 (95% CI: 0.194, 0.294)) to worst (PD = 0.601 (95% CI: 0.556, 0.647)) quality environments, and in females from best (PD = 0.446 (95% CI: 0.385, 0.507)) to worst (PD = 0.655 (95% CI: 0.607, 0.703)). We found that poor environmental quality exacerbates the LTPIA-obesity relationship. Efforts to improve obesity through LTPIA may benefit from considering this relationship."
https://openalex.org/W2889289206,"Background Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in end-stage renal disease and is strongly associated with vascular calcification. Both kidney transplantation and phosphate binders may lower the risk of vascular calcification. Vascular calcification is actively inhibited by vitamin-K-dependent matrix γ-carboxyglutamic acid protein (MGP). Whether kidney transplantation or phosphate binders affect vitamin K status is unknown. Therefore, we studied the influence of kidney transplantation and phosphate binder use on vitamin K status. Methods We measured plasma desphospho-uncarboxylated MGP (dp-ucMGP), a marker reflecting low vitamin K status, in a cross-sectional study of patients on hemodialysis (n = 82), peritoneal dialysis (n = 31) or who recently received a kidney transplantation (n = 36). By medication inventory, we assessed phosphate binder use. With linear regression, we assessed the influence of kidney transplantation and phosphate binder use on natural-log-transformed dp-ucMGP, adjusting for potential confounders. Results Mean age of patients was 52±13 years; 102 (68%) were male. Dp-ucMGP levels were significantly lower in kidney transplant recipients (median 689 pmol/L) compared to patients on dialysis (median 1537 pmol/L, p<0.001). Eighty-nine patients on dialysis used phosphate binders. Using any phosphate binder was not associated with dp-ucMGP levels (median 1637 pmol/L, p = 0.09) compared to no phosphate binders (median 1142 pmol/L). Twenty-six patients used sevelamer monotherapy, which was associated with higher dp-ucMGP levels (median 1740 pmol/L, p = 0.04) after adjusting for age, sex and vitamin K antagonist use. Conclusions Recent kidney transplantation is associated with lower dp-ucMGP levels suggesting improved vitamin K status after transplantation. Sevelamer monotherapy is associated with higher dp-ucMGP levels suggesting worsening of vitamin K status. Both findings warrant more attention to vitamin K status in patients on dialysis, as vitamin K is necessary for protection against vascular calcification."
https://openalex.org/W2889293674,"The major physiological determinants of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) phenology in a given area are a response to vernalization temperature and day length, which are at least in part, regulated by the allelic variation at the vernalization (VRN) and photoperiod (PPD) loci, respectively. Characterization of the existing genetic variation for plant phenology in winter wheat can assist breeding programs improve adaptation to local environments and to optimize wheat phenology for the changing climate. The objectives of this research were to characterize the allelic variation at the major VRN and PPD loci in a diverse panel of high latitude winter wheat genotypes (n = 203) and to associate the allelic variation with phenologic, agronomic and adaptation traits. The panel was genotyped using allele-specific markers at vernalization (VRN-A1, VRN-B1, VRN-D1 and VRN-B3) and photoperiod (PPD-A1, PPD-B1, and PPD-D1) loci and phenotyped for agronomically-important traits. Though photoperiod sensitivity was more prevalent, most of the variation in the phenology of the winter wheat panel was explained by allelic variation at PPD-D1, PPD-A1, and the interaction between these loci. While a typical high latitude winter wheat genotype is one that carries winter alleles at all major VRN loci and photoperiod sensitive alleles at the major PPD loci, in lower latitudes where winters are milder, the presence of one or two photoperiod insensitive alleles seems to contribute to higher yield and wider adaptation."
https://openalex.org/W2888864426,"Background Motivation is critical to health worker performance and work quality. In Bihar, India, frontline health workers provide essential health services for the state’s poorest citizens. Yet, there is a shortfall of motivated and skilled providers and a lack of coordination between two cadres of frontline health workers and their supervisors. CARE India developed an approach aimed at improving health workers’ performance by shifting work culture and strengthening teamwork and motivation. The intervention—“Team-Based Goals and Incentives”—supported health workers to work as teams towards collective goals and rewarded success with public recognition and non-financial incentives. Methods Thirty months after initiating the intervention, 885 health workers and 98 supervisors completed an interviewer-administered questionnaire in 38 intervention and 38 control health sub-centers in one district. The questionnaire included measures of social cohesion, teamwork attitudes, self-efficacy, job satisfaction, teamwork behaviors, equitable service delivery, taking initiative, and supervisory support. We conducted bivariate analyses to examine the impact of the intervention on these psychosocial and behavioral outcomes. Results Results show statistically significant differences across several measures between intervention and control frontline health workers, including improved teamwork (mean = 8.8 vs. 7.3), empowerment (8.5 vs. 7.4), job satisfaction (7.1 vs. 5.99) and equitable service delivery (6.7 vs. 4.99). While fewer significant differences were found for supervisors, they reported improved teamwork (8.4 vs. 5.3), and frontline health workers reported improved fulfillment of supervisory duties by their supervisors (8.9 vs. 7.6). Both frontline health workers and supervisors found public recognition and enhanced teamwork more motivating than the non-financial incentives. Conclusions The Team-Based Goals and Incentives model reinforces intrinsic motivation and supports improvements in the teamwork, motivation, and performance of health workers. It offers an approach to practitioners and governments for improving the work environment in a resource-constrained setting and where there are multiple cadres of health workers."
https://openalex.org/W2888789362,"Background The Introduction of mobile health (mHealth) devices to health intervention studies challenges us as researchers to adapt how we analyse the impact of these technologies. For interventions involving chronic illness self-management, we must consider changes in behaviour in addition to changes in health. Fortunately, these mHealth technologies can record participants’ interactions via usage-logs during research interventions. Objective The objective of this paper is to demonstrate the potential of analysing mHealth usage-logs by presenting an in-depth analysis as a preliminary study for using behavioural theories to contextualize the user-recorded results of mHealth intervention studies. We use the logs collected by persons with type 2 diabetes during a randomized controlled trial (RCT) as a use-case. Methods The Few Touch Application was tested in a year-long intervention, which allowed participants to register and review their blood glucose, diet and physical activity, goals, and access general disease information. Usage-logs, i.e. logged interactions with the mHealth devices, were collected from participants (n = 101) in the intervention groups. HbA1c was collected (baseline, 4- and 12-months). Usage logs were categorized into registrations or navigations. Results There were n = 29 non-mHealth users, n = 11 short-term users and n = 61 long-term users. Non-mHealth users increased (+0.33%) while Long-term users reduced their HbA1c (-0.86%), which was significantly different (P = .021). Long-term users significantly decreased their usage over the year (P < .001). K-means clustering revealed two clusters: one dominated by diet/exercise interactions (n = 16), and one dominated by BG interactions and navigations in general (n = 40). The only significant difference between these two clusters was that the first cluster spent more time on the goals functionalities than the second (P < .001). Conclusion By comparing participants based upon their usage-logs, we were able to discern differences in HbA1c as well as usage patterns. This approach demonstrates the potential of analysing usage-logs to better understand how participants engage during mHealth intervention studies."
https://openalex.org/W2889013762,"Background Little is known about the decision-making experiences of seniors and informal caregivers facing decisions about seniors’ housing decisions when objective decision making measures are used. Objectives To report on seniors’ and caregivers’ experiences of housing decisions. Design A cross-sectional study with a quantitative approach supplemented by qualitative data. Setting Sixteen health jurisdictions providing home care services, Quebec province, Canada. Participants Two separate samples of seniors aged ≥ 65 years and informal caregivers of cognitively impaired seniors who had made a decision about housing. Measurements Information on preferred choice and actual choice about housing, role assumed in the decision, decisional conflict and decision regret was obtained through closed-ended questionnaires. Research assistants paraphrased participants’ narratives about their decision-making experiences and made other observations in standardized logbooks. Results Thirty-one seniors (median age: 85.5 years) and 48 caregivers (median age: 65.1 years) were recruited. Both seniors and caregivers preferred that the senior stay at home (64.5% and 71.7% respectively). Staying home was the actual choice for only 32.2% of participating seniors and 36.2% of the seniors cared for by the participating caregivers. Overall, 93% seniors and 71% caregivers reported taking an active or collaborative role in the decision-making process. The median decisional conflict score was 23/100 for seniors and 30/100 for caregivers. The median decision regret score was the same for both (10/100). Qualitative analysis revealed that the housing decision was influenced by factors such as seniors’ health and safety concerns and caregivers’ burden of care. Some caregivers felt sad and guilty when the decision did not match the senior’s preference. Conclusion The actual housing decision made for seniors frequently did not match their preferred housing option. Advanced care planning regarding housing and better decision support are needed for these difficult decisions."
https://openalex.org/W2889213440,"Borrelia burgdorferi, the causative agent of Lyme disease, survives in nature through a cycle that alternates between ticks and vertebrates. To facilitate this defined lifestyle, B. burgdorferi has evolved a gene regulatory network that ensures transmission between those hosts, along with specific adaptations to niches within each host. Several regulatory proteins are known to be essential for the bacterium to complete these critical tasks, but interactions between regulators had not previously been investigated in detail, due to experimental uses of different strain backgrounds and growth conditions. To address that deficit in knowledge, the transcriptomic impacts of four critical regulatory proteins were examined in a uniform strain background. Pairs of mutants and their wild-type parent were grown simultaneously under a single, specific culture condition, permitting direct comparisons between the mutant strains. Transcriptomic analyses were strand-specific, and assayed both coding and noncoding RNAs. Intersection analyses identified regulatory overlaps between regulons, including transcripts involved in carbohydrate and polyamine metabolism. In addition, it was found that transcriptional units such as ospC and dbpBA, which were previously observed to be affected by alternative sigma factors, are transcribed by RNA polymerase using the housekeeping sigma factor, RpoD."
https://openalex.org/W2889062795,"Messenger RNA polyadenylation is a universal aspect of gene expression in eukaryotes. In well-established model organisms, this process is mediated by a conserved complex of 15–20 subunits. To better understand this process in apicomplexans, a group of unicellular parasites that causes serious disease in humans and livestock, a computational and high throughput sequencing study of the polyadenylation complex and poly(A) sites in several species was conducted. BLAST-based searches for orthologs of the human polyadenylation complex yielded clear matches to only two—poly(A) polymerase and CPSF73—of the 19 proteins used as queries in this analysis. As the human subunits that recognize the AAUAAA polyadenylation signal (PAS) were not immediately obvious, a computational analysis of sequences adjacent to experimentally-determined apicomplexan poly(A) sites was conducted. The results of this study showed that there exists in apicomplexans an A-rich region that corresponds in position to the AAUAAA PAS. The set of experimentally-determined sites in one species, Sarcocystis neurona, was further analyzed to evaluate the extent and significance of alternative poly(A) site choice in this organism. The results showed that almost 80% of S. neurona genes possess more than one poly(A) site, and that more than 780 sites showed differential usage in the two developmental stages–extracellular merozoites and intracellular schizonts–studied. These sites affected more than 450 genes, and included a disproportionate number of genes that encode membrane transporters and ribosomal proteins. Taken together, these results reveal that apicomplexan species seem to possess a poly(A) signal analogous to AAUAAA even though genes that may encode obvious counterparts of the AAUAAA-recognizing proteins are absent in these organisms. They also indicate that, as is the case in other eukaryotes, alternative polyadenylation is a widespread phenomenon in S. neurona that has the potential to impact growth and development."
https://openalex.org/W2889104793,"Background There is little evidence on the potential health benefits of active travel in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). The aim of this study was to assess the association between levels of active travel and physical multi-morbidity (i.e., two or more chronic physical conditions) and individual physical conditions among community-dwelling adults aged 65 or older in six LMICs. Methods Data were analyzed from the World Health Organization’s Study on Global Ageing and Adult Health (China, Ghana, India, Mexico, Russia, South Africa). Active travel (minutes / week) was assessed with questions of the Global Physical Activity Questionnaire (GPAQ) and presented in tertiles. Eleven chronic conditions (angina, arthritis, asthma, chronic back pain, chronic lung disease, diabetes, edentulism, hearing problems, hypertension, stroke, visual impairment) were assessed by self-report of diagnosis, symptoms, or blood pressure measurement. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was conducted to assess the association between levels of active travel, physical conditions and physical multi-morbidity. Results The final sample consisted of 14,585 individuals aged ≥65 years (mean age = 72.6±0.1 years; 54.9% female). In the fully adjusted model, compared to the highest tertile, those in the lowest tertile of active travel had a 1.28 (95%CI = 1.06–1.54) times higher odds for physical multi-morbidity. The association between active travel and physical multi-morbidity was significantly mediated by affect (14.4%) and cognition (9.7%). With regard to individual conditions, hearing problems, hypertension, stroke, and visual impairment were particularly strongly associated with less active travel. Conclusion The current data suggest that lower levels of active travel are associated with the presence of physical health conditions and physical multi-morbidity. This multi-national study offers potentially valuable insight for a number of hypotheses which may influence this relationship, although testing with longitudinal studies is needed."
https://openalex.org/W2889375457,"Although questionable research practices (QRPs) and p-hacking have received attention in recent years, little research has focused on their prevalence and acceptance in students. Students are the researchers of the future and will represent the field in the future. Therefore, they should not be learning to use and accept QRPs, which would reduce their ability to produce and evaluate meaningful research. 207 psychology students and fresh graduates provided self-report data on the prevalence and predictors of QRPs. Attitudes towards QRPs, belief that significant results constitute better science or lead to better grades, motivation, and stress levels were predictors. Furthermore, we assessed perceived supervisor attitudes towards QRPs as an important predictive factor. The results were in line with estimates of QRP prevalence from academia. The best predictor of QRP use was students' QRP attitudes. Perceived supervisor attitudes exerted both a direct and indirect effect via student attitudes. Motivation to write a good thesis was a protective factor, whereas stress had no effect. Students in this sample did not subscribe to beliefs that significant results were better for science or their grades. Such beliefs further did not impact QRP attitudes or use in this sample. Finally, students engaged in more QRPs pertaining to reporting and analysis than those pertaining to study design. We conclude that supervisors have an important function in shaping students' attitudes towards QRPs and can improve their research practices by motivating them well. Furthermore, this research provides some impetus towards identifying predictors of QRP use in academia."
https://openalex.org/W2888982594,"Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension (PAH) is a fatal disorder with limited treatment options and reduced life expectancy after diagnosis. Complex genetic backgrounds in PAH complicates identification of causative mutations that is essential for an understanding of the disease diagnostics and etiology especially for idiopathic PAH (iPAH). Hemolysis has been implicated as contributing to the pathobiology of PAH. Glucose-6-Phosphate Dehydrogenase (G6PD) expression and activity define erythrocyte's antioxidant capacity, and its decrease contributes to erythrocyte fragility. As G6PD deficiency was previously reported in a limited number of PAH cases, we tested whether iPAH patients exhibit underlying G6PD alterations in erythrocytes. A cohort of 22 PAH patients and 8 non-PAH patients were recruited for this study. DNA isolated from Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells (PBMC) was used for detection of mutations in the coding region of the G6PD gene. RNA isolated from PBMC was used for determination of G6PD mRNA expression level. G6PD activity was measured in Red Blood Cell (RBC) pellets. Three patients had missense mutations in G6PD (Val291Met, Asn126Asp, Asp194Glu), however, only one mutation (Val291Met) results in a severe G6PD deficiency. A single patient with mutation (Asn126Asp) showed a 21% decrease in G6PD activity, two subjects showed G6PD deficiency without mutations, and one patient had a decreased level of G6PD mRNA and reduced enzyme levels. This study demonstrates that a moderate decrease in G6PD activity is associated with PAH. Screening for G6PD activity and mutations in the G6PD gene may provide early detection of individuals predisposed to PAH."
https://openalex.org/W2889048156,"South Africa has implemented a community-based HIV programme (CBHP) in its primary healthcare (PHC) re-engineering strategy that aims to improve public healthcare delivery. This CBHP is delivered by ward-based outreach teams (WBOTs); provision of community HIV services comprises an important component of this programme. We conducted an exploratory study to determine the facilitators and barriers to successful implementation of this CBHP in rural Mopani District, South Africa. Focus group discussions were conducted with the community health workers (CHWs) and PHC nurses; participant interviews were conducted with community members who access these health services, community leaders, and social workers. We conducted a thematic content analysis and based on the key themes reported, we identified the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research, consisting of five domains, as the most appropriate model to interpret our findings. First, in terms of intervention characteristics, community members generally valued the HIV services provided, but the variable needs impacted on programme implementation. Outer setting challenges include inability to meet the need of patients as a result of stigma, non-disclosure of HIV status and social factors. In terms of the inner setting, CHWs were grateful for the equipment and training received but expressed the need for better support of management and the provision of additional resources. With regard to characteristics of the implementers, the CHWs expressed the desire for further training despite reporting having sufficient knowledge to conduct their HIV work. Finally, in terms of the implementation process, the importance of relationship building between CHWs and community members was emphasised. In conclusion, these data underline the positive receipt and potential of the CBHP in this rural district and identify areas to further strengthen the programme. The success and sustainability of the CBHP requires ongoing commitment of resources, training, supervision, and organisational support in order to operate effectively and efficiently."
https://openalex.org/W2889078658,"Deoxynivalenol (DON) contamination of cereal grains caused by Fusarium head blight may be addressed by future RNA interference (RNAi)-based gene silencing approaches. However, utilizing these approaches will require a greater understanding of the principles that govern RNAi effectiveness in the pathogen Fusarium graminearum. RNAi in higher eukaryotes, including fungi, involves processing double stranded RNA (dsRNA) into small interfering RNA (siRNA) that silence gene expression based on base pair complementarity. This study examined virulence, DON production, and the small RNA (sRNA) populations in response to RNAi-based silencing of TRI6, a transcription factor that positively regulates DON synthesis via control of TRI5 expression. Silencing was accomplished via the expression of transgenes encoding inverted repeats targeting various regions of TRI6 (RNAi vectors). Transgene expression was associated with novel, TRI6-specific siRNAs. For RNAi vectors targeting the majority of TRI6 sequence (~600 bp), a discontinuous, repeatable pattern was observed in which most siRNAs mapped to specific regions of TRI6. Targeting shorter regions (250-350 bp) did not alter the siRNA populations corresponding to that region of TRI6. No phased processing was observed. The 5' base of ~83% of siRNAs was uracil, consistent with DICER processing and ARGONAUTE binding preferences for siRNA. Mutant lines showed TRI6 siRNA-associated reductions of TRI5 expression on toxin inducing media and DON in infected wheat and barley spikes. Shorter RNAi vectors resulted in variable levels of silencing that were less than for the ~600 bp RNAi vector, with a 343 bp RNAi vector targeting the 5' end of TRI6 having the best silencing efficiency. This work identifies efficient shorter region for silencing of TRI6 and describes the patterns of siRNA corresponding to those regions."
https://openalex.org/W2889253730,"Cryptococcal meningoencephalitis, the most common form of cryptococcosis, is caused by the opportunistic fungal pathogen, Cryptococcus neoformans. Molecular strategies used by C. neoformans to invade the central nervous system (CNS) have been the focus of several studies. Recently, the role of a novel secreted metalloprotease (Mpr1) in the pathogenicity of C. neoformans was confirmed by studies demonstrating that Mpr1 mediated the migration of fungal cells into the CNS. Given this central function, the aim here was to identify the molecular determinants of Mpr1 activity and resolve their role in the migration of cryptococci across the blood-brain barrier (BBB). The Mpr1 protein belongs to an understudied group of metalloproteases of the M36 class of fungalysins unique to fungi. They are generally synthesized as propeptides with fairly long prodomains and highly conserved regions within their catalytic core. Through structure-function analysis of Mpr1, our study identified the prodomain cleavage sites of Mpr1 and demonstrated that when mutated, the prodomain appears to remain attached to the catalytic C-terminus of Mpr1 rendering a nonfunctional Mpr1 protein and an inability for cryptococci to cross the BBB. We found that proteolytic activity of Mpr1 was dependent on the coordination of zinc with two histidine residues in the active site of Mpr1, since amino acid substitutions in the HExxH motif abolished Mpr1 proteolytic activity and prevented the migration of cryptococci across the BBB. A phylogenetic analysis of Mpr1 revealed a distinct pattern likely reflecting the neurotropic nature of C. neoformans and the specific function of Mpr1 in breaching the BBB. This study contributes to a deeper understanding of the molecular regulation of Mpr1 activity and may lead to the development of specific inhibitors that could be used to restrict fungal penetration of the CNS and thus prevent cryptococcal meningoencephalitis-related deaths."
https://openalex.org/W2889356694,"Visual working memory capacity is estimated to be around 3–4 items, but on some trials participants fail to correctly report even a single item from the memory array. Such failures of working memory performance are surprisingly common, and participants have poor self-awareness of them. Previous work has shown that behavioral feedback can reduce the frequency of working memory failures, but the benefits of feedback disappeared immediately after it was taken away. Here, we tested whether extended practice with or without trial-by-trial feedback would lead to persistent improvements in working memory performance. Participants were assigned to one of four groups: (1) Working memory practice with feedback (2) Working memory practice without feedback (3) Crossword puzzle active control (4) No-contact control. Consistent with previous work, simple practice with a visual working memory task robustly improved working memory performance across practice sessions. However, we found only partial support for the efficacy of feedback in improving working memory performance. Practicing with feedback improved working memory performance relative to a no-feedback group for some practice sessions. However, the feedback benefits did not persist across all training sessions and did not transfer to a final test session without the feedback. Thus, the benefits of performance feedback did not persist over time. Further, we found only stimulus-specific transfer of visual working memory practice benefits. We also found that participants’ metaknowledge improved with practice, but that receiving feedback about task accuracy actually slightly harmed the accuracy of concurrent metaknowledge ratings. Finally, we discuss important design considerations for future work in this area (e.g. power, expectations, and “spacing effects”). For example, we found that achieved statistical power to detect a between-groups effect declined with practice. This finding has potentially critical implications for any study using a 1-session study to calculate power for a planned multi-session study."
https://openalex.org/W2888776050,"The reflection of passive arm displacement in a mirror is a powerful means of inducing a kinaesthetic illusion in the static arm hidden behind the mirror. Our recent research findings suggest that this illusion is not solely visual in origin but results from the combination of visual and proprioceptive signals from the two arms. To determine the respective contributions of visual and proprioceptive signals to this illusion, we reproduced the mirror paradigm in virtual reality. As in the physical version of the mirror paradigm, one of the participant's arms (the left arm, in our study) could be flexed or extended passively. This movement was combined with displacements of the avatar's left and right forearms, as viewed in a first-person perspective through a virtual reality headset. In order to distinguish between visual and proprioceptive contributions, two unimodal conditions were applied separately: displacement of the avatar's forearms in the absence of physical displacement of the left arm (the visual condition), and displacement of the left forearm while the avatar's forearms were masked (the proprioceptive condition). Of the 34 female participants included in the study, 28 experienced a kinaesthetic mirror illusion in their static (right) arm. The strength of the illusion (expressed in terms of speed and duration) evoked by the bimodal condition was much higher than that observed in either of the two unimodal conditions. Our present results confirm that the involvement of visual signals in the mirror illusion-often considered as a prototypic visual illusion-has been overstated. The mirror illusion also involves non-visual signals (bilateral proprioceptive-somaesthetic signals, in fact) that interact with the visual signals and strengthen the kinaesthetic effect."
https://openalex.org/W2888797003,"Flooding frequency is predicted to increase during the next decades in Europe. Therefore, it is important to understand how short-term disturbance events affect soil biota providing essential ecosystem functions and uncover factors modulating their response such as plant community composition. Here we report on the response of soil microarthropod communities (Collembola and Acari) to a severe summer flood in 2013, which affected major parts of central Europe. Collembola and Acari density and Collembola and Oribatida richness were strongly affected by the flood, but they recovered within three months. Effects of plant community composition on soil microarthropods disappeared after the flood, presumably due to homogenization of the field, but the effects of plant community were in a stage of being reasserted three months after the flood.

Long-term impacts, however, remain unknown and deserve further investigation."
https://openalex.org/W2889063781,"The Nociceptin/Orphanin FQ (N/OFQ) peptide NOP receptor is coupled to pertussis toxin (PTX)-sensitive G proteins (Gi/o) whose activation leads to the inhibition of both cAMP production and calcium channel activity, and to the stimulation of potassium currents. The label free dynamic mass redistribution (DMR) approach has been demonstrated useful for investigating the pharmacological profile of G protein-coupled receptors. Herein, we employ DMR technology to systematically characterize the pharmacology of a large panel of NOP receptor ligands. These are of peptide and non-peptide nature and display varying degrees of receptor efficacy, ranging from full agonism to pure antagonism. Using Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells expressing the human NOP receptor we provide rank orders of potency for full and partial agonists as well as apparent affinities for selective antagonists. We find the pharmacological profile of NOP receptor ligands to be similar but not identical to values reported in the literature using canonical assays for Gi/o-coupled receptors. Our data demonstrate that holistic label-free DMR detection can be successfully used to investigate the pharmacology of the NOP receptor and to characterize the cellular effects of novel NOP receptor ligands."
https://openalex.org/W2888958405,"Background The heterogeneous distribution of emphysema is a key feature of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients that typically is evaluated using high-resolution chest computed tomography (HRCT). Oxygen-enhanced pulmonary magnetic resonance imaging (OEMRI) is a new method to obtain information regarding regional ventilation, diffusion, and perfusion in the lung without radiation exposure. We aimed to compare OEMRI with HRCT for the assessment of heterogeneity in COPD patients. Methods Forty patients with stable COPD underwent quantitative HRCT, OEMRI, and pulmonary function tests, including arterial blood gas analysis. OEMRI was also performed on nine healthy control subjects. We measured the severity of emphysema (percent low attenuation volume; LAV%) in whole lungs and the standard deviations (SDs) of the LAV% values of 10 isovolumetric partitions (SD-LAV) as an index of cranial-caudal heterogeneity. Similarly, relative enhancement ratios of oxygen (RERs) in whole lungs from OEMRI and SD-RER were analyzed. Results COPD patients showed a lower mean RER than control subjects (12.6% vs 22.0%, p<0.01). The regional heterogeneity of the RERs was not always consistent with the LAV distribution. Both the HRCT (LAV% and SD-LAV) and the OEMRI (RER and SD-RER) indices were significantly associated with the diffusion capacity (DLCO) and partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood (PaO2). The PaO2 was associated only with the heterogeneity index of HRCT (SD-LAV) (R2 = 0.39); however, the PaO2 was associated with both the mean RER and heterogeneity (SD-RER) in the multivariate analysis (R2 = 0.38). Conclusions OEMRI-derived parameters were directly associated with oxygen uptake in COPD patients. Although the OEMRI-derived parameters were not identical to the HRCT-derived parameters, the cranial-caudal heterogeneity in HRCT or OEMRI was complementary to that in evaluations of oxygen uptake in the lungs. Functional imaging seems to provide new insights into COPD pathophysiology without radiation exposure."
https://openalex.org/W2889456866,"Data from a growing number of experimental studies show that exposure to higher correlated color temperature (CCT) ambient light, containing more blue light, can positively impact alertness and cognitive performance in older children and adults. To date, few if any studies have examined whether light exposure influences cognitive task performance in preschool-age children, who are in the midst of rapid developmental changes in attention and executive function skills. In this study, healthy children aged 4.5–5.5 years (n = 20; 11 females) completed measures of sustained attention and task switching twice while being exposed to LED light set to either 3500K (a lower CCT) or 5000K (a higher CCT). A control group (n = 18; 10 females) completed the tasks twice under only the 3500K lighting condition. Although the lighting condition did not impact performance on the sustained attention task, exposure to the higher CCT light lead to greater improvement in preschool-age children’s task switching performance (F(1,36) = 4.41, p = 0.04). Children in the control group showed a 6.5% increase in task switching accuracy between time points, whereas those in the experimental group improved by 15.2%. Our primary finding–that exposure to light at a higher correlated color temperature leads to greater improvement in task switching performance–indicates that the relationship between the spectral power distribution of light and executive function abilities is present early in cognitive development. These data have implications for designing learning environments and suggest that light may be an important contextual factor in the lives of young children in both the home and the classroom."
https://openalex.org/W2889489428,"Actinoporins sticholysin I and sticholysin II (St I, St II) are proposed to lyse model and biomembranes via toroidal pore formation by their N-terminal domain. Based on the hypothesis that peptide fragments can reproduce the structure and function of this domain, the behavior of peptides containing St I residues 12–31 (StI12-31), St II residues 11–30 (StII11-30), and its TOAC-labeled analogue (N-TOAC-StII11-30) was examined. Molecular modeling showed a good match with experimental structures, indicating amphipathic α-helices in the same regions as in the toxins. CD spectra revealed that the peptides were essentially unstructured in aqueous solution, acquiring α-helical conformation upon interaction with micelles and large unilamellar vesicles (LUV) of variable lipid composition. Fluorescence quenching studies with NBD-containing lipids indicated that N-TOAC-StII11-30’s nitroxide moiety is located in the membranes polar head group region. Pyrene-labeled phospholipid inter-leaflet redistribution suggested that the peptides form toroidal pores, according to the mechanism of action proposed for the toxins. Binding occurred only to negatively charged LUV, indicating the importance of electrostatic interactions; in contrast the peptides bound to both negatively charged and zwitterionic micelles, pointing to a lesser influence of these interactions. In addition, differences between bilayers and micelles in head group packing and in curvature led to differences in peptide-membrane interaction. We propose that the peptides topography in micelles resembles that of the toxins in the toroidal pore. The peptides mimicked the toxins permeabilizing activity, St II peptides being more effective than StI12-31. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration that differences in the toxins N-terminal amphipathic α-helix play a role in the difference between St I and St II activities."
https://openalex.org/W2889087534,"Toyocamycin is a member of the nucleoside antibiotic family and has been recognized as a promising fungicide for the control of plant diseases. However, low productivity of toyocamycin remains an important bottleneck in its industrial production. Therefore, dramatic improvements of strains for overproduction of toyocamycin are of great interest in applied microbiology research. In this study, we sequentially selected for mutations for multiple drug resistance to promote the overproduction of toyocamycin by Streptomyces diastatochromogenes 1628. The triple mutant strain, SD3145 (str str par), was obtained through sequential screenings. This strain showed an enhanced capacity to produce toyocamycin (1500 mg/L), 24-fold higher than the wild type in GYM liquid medium. This dramatic overproduction was attributed at least partially to the acquisition of an rsmG mutation and increased gene expression of toyA, which encodes a LuxR-family transcriptional regulator for toyocamycin biosynthesis. The expression of toyF and toyG, probably directly involved in toyocamycin biosynthesis, was also enhanced, contributing to toyocamycin overproduction. By addition of a small amount of scandium (ScCl3·6H2O), the mutant strain, SD3145, produced more toyocamycin (2664 mg/L) in TPM medium, which was the highest toyocamycin level produced in shake-flask fermentation by a streptomycete so far. We demonstrated that introduction of combined drug resistance mutations into S. diastatochromogenes 1628 resulted in an obvious increase in the toyocamycin production. The triple mutant strain, SD3145, generated in our study could be useful for improvement of industrial production of toyocamycin."
https://openalex.org/W2889034175,"Well-functioning physician-patient communication is central to primary care consultations. An increasing demand on primary care in many countries to manage a culturally diverse population has highlighted the need for improved communication skills in intercultural consultations. In previous studies, intercultural consultations in primary care have often been described as complex for various reasons, but studies exploring physician-patient interactions contributing to the understanding of why they are complex are lacking. Therefore, the aim of this study was to explore intercultural physician-patient communication in primary care consultations, generating a conceptual model of the interpersonal interactions as described by both the patients and the physicians. Using grounded theory methodology, 15 residents in family medicine and 30 foreign-born patients, the latter with Arabic and Somali as native languages, were interviewed. The analysis generated a conceptual model named circling the undefined, where a silent agreement on issues fundamental to the core of the consultation was inadequately presumed and the communicative behaviors used did not contribute to clarity. This could be a possible contributory cause of the perceived complexity of intercultural consultations. Identifying what takes place on an interpersonal level in intercultural consultations might be a first step towards building a common ground for increased mutual understanding, thereby bringing us one step closer to sharing, rather than circling the undefined."
https://openalex.org/W2889474523,"The causal mutation for polledness in Nelore (Bos taurus indicus) breed seems to have appeared first in Brazil in 1957. The expression of the polled trait is known to be ruled by a few groups of alleles in taurine breeds; however, the genetic basis of this trait in indicine cattle is still unclear. The aim of this study was to identify genomic regions associated with the hornless trait in a commercial Nelore population. A total of 107,294 animals had phenotypes recorded and 2,238 were genotyped/imputed for 777k SNP. The weighted single-step approach for genome-wide association study (WssGWAS) was used to estimate the SNP effects and variances accounted for by 1 Mb sliding SNP windows. A centromeric region of chromosome 1 with 3.11 Mb size (BTA1: 878,631-3,987,104 bp) was found to be associated with hornless in the studied population. A total of 28 protein-coding genes are mapped in this region, including the taurine Polled locus and the IFNAR1, IFNAR2, IFNGR2, KRTAP11-1, MIS18A, OLIG1, OLIG2, and SOD1 genes, which expression can be related to the horn formation as described in literature. The functional enrichment analysis by DAVID tool revealed cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, JAK-STAT signaling, natural killer cell mediated cytotoxicity, and osteoclast differentiation pathways as significant (P < 0.05). In addition, a runs of homozygosity (ROH) analysis identified a ROH island in polled animals with 2.47 Mb inside the region identified by WssGWAS. Polledness in Nelore cattle is associated with one region in the genome with 3.1 Mb size in chromosome 1. Several genes are harbored in this region, and they may act together in the determination of the polled/horned phenotype. Fine mapping the locus responsible for polled trait in Nelore breed and the identification of the molecular mechanisms regulating the horn growth deserve further investigation."
https://openalex.org/W2889466036,"Background The impact of cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) on the quality of life of patients has been neglected in research studies worldwide. The few reported studies have used non-specific questionnaires for the disease, which represents a limitation since generic instruments may not address specific aspects of the disease, compromising the evaluation of its real impact. The aim of this paper is to describe the development and the initial validation of an instrument for evaluating the impact of CL, named the Cutaneous Leishmaniasis Impact Questionnaire. Methodology The formulation and validation of the instrument consisted of the following steps: (1) literature review; (2) conceptual framework construction and initial item generation; (3) tool analysis by health professionals (experts); (4) tool evaluation performed by the patients; and (5) a pilot study with 100 patients with localized CL, evaluated at a reference ambulatory facility in Belo Horizonte, in the state of Minas Gerais, Brazil. The structure of the proposed instrument was analyzed using hierarchical cluster analysis (ICLUST). Results Twenty-seven items were initially proposed by the researchers to compose the questionnaire. Content validity (evaluates if the instrument fully assesses the construct of interest) was evaluated by the panel of experts, while face validity (evaluates how potential participants interpret the items) was evaluated by the target population. In this step, some items were excluded, reformulated and/or included. After evaluating a factorial structure of the items in accordance with the cluster analysis, we assembled a questionnaire with 25 items (alpha = 0.86), with high reliability and homogeneity, which address the following: 1) the general impact of the disease (alpha = 0.91, beta = 0.67) and 2) the evaluation of the perception about the treatment and health services (alpha = 0.72, beta = 0.51). Conclusions The Cutaneous Leishmaniasis Impact Questionnaire, developed with contributions from patients and experts, was confirmed, in this first validation, as a useful and reliable instrument."
https://openalex.org/W2889073536,"Background The prognostic impact of relative wall thickness (RWT), ventricular concentricity, is controversial. Methods We retrospectively analyzed data obtained from 4444 consecutive patients who had undergone both transthoracic echocardiography and electrocardiography at our hospital in 2013. Those who presented with a history of previous episodes of myocardial infarctions and severe or moderate valvular disease were excluded from the analysis. We calculated RWT as follows: (2 x diastolic posterior wall thickness) / (the diastolic LV dimension). We defined high RWT as a ratio > 0.42. A total of 3654 patients were categorized into two groups: 492 with high RWT, and 3162 with normal RWT. Results The mean ages of those in the normal and high RWT groups were 64.6 (±standard deviation 16.3) and 71.6 (± 12.7) years, respectively (p<0.001). Prevalence of male sex, history of diabetes, hypertension, and chronic kidney disease, and the left atrium volume index was higher for the high RWT group than for the normal RWT group. The median follow-up period was 1274 days (interquartile range, 410–1470). The Kaplan-Meier curves showed a constant increase in all-cause death, with cumulative 3-year incidences of 18.3% and 10.8% for the high RWT and normal RWT groups, respectively (log-rank p<0.001). After adjusting for confounders, the increased mortality risk for those with high RWT relative to normal RWT was significant (hazard ratio, 1.64; 95% confidence interval, 1.27–2.10). This trend was consistent for the composite of deaths and major adverse cardiac events. Conclusion High RWT has a deleterious impact on long-term mortality."

The origins of community-acquired ESBL-E carriage and infections remain unclear. Bean sprouts are a potential source of Enterobacteriaceae for the community, as illustrated by outbreaks of pathogenic Enterobacteriaceae in the past. The current study focuses on contamination of retail bean sprouts with ESBL-E in the Netherlands. Of 131 bean sprout samples purchased between 2013 and 2016, 25 (19%) were contaminated with ESBL-E. The detected isolates were almost exclusively Klebsiella spp. and co-resistance to other antibiotics was observed frequently. Over time there was substantial genetic diversity between isolates. On the other hand, isolates from samples closely matched in time were frequently clonally related, indicative of batch contamination. Remarkably, no Escherichia coli was found. In conclusion, bean sprouts frequently harbor ESBL-E, which is a potential source for consumers."
https://openalex.org/W2888982898,"Intermittent theta burst stimulation (iTBS) and continuous theta burst stimulation (cTBS) are protocols used in repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) or cortical electrical stimulation (CES) to facilitate or suppress corticospinal excitability. However, rTMS and CES excite all types of neuron in the target cortex probed by the coil or electrode, making it difficult to differentiate the effect of TBS on specific neural circuits involved in motor plasticity. In this study, TBS protocols were converted into an optogenetic model to achieve focalized and cell-type-specific cortical modulation. Light-sensitive channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) was expressed in the glutamatergic neuron in the primary motor cortex (M1) driven by the CaMKIIα promoter. A custom-made optrode comprising an optical fiber and a metal cannula electrode was fabricated to achieve optogenetic stimulation and simultaneous local field potential (LFP) recording. Single-pulse CES was delivered into M1 to elicit motor-evoked potential (MEP), which served as an indicator of motor excitability, before and after TBS intervention. Results show that both CES-iTBS and optogenetic iTBS (Opto-iTBS) can potentiate MEP activity. However, CES-cTBS suppressed MEP activity whereas Opto-cTBS enhanced it. This discrepancy may have resulted from the different neural networks targeted by the two TBS modalities, with CES-cTBS exciting all types of neuron and Opto-cTBS targeting excitatory neuron specifically. The results support the idea that intra-cortical networks determine the variation of TBS-induced neuroplasticity. This study shows that focalized and cell-type-specific brain stimulation using the optogenetic approach is viable and can be extended for further exploration of neuroplasticity."

However, current data in Africa suggested modest impact of widespread antiretroviral therapy scale-up especially regarding HIV-related hospitalization. In this study, we aimed to describe causes of hospitalization and factors associated with AIDS-defining events and inpatient mortality.A retrospective study was performed on medical records of HIV positive patients admitted for at least 24 hours in the Infectious Diseases Unit of the University Hospital Joseph Raseta Befelatanana Antananarivo. Cause of hospitalization was considered as the main diagnosis related to the symptoms at admission. Diagnostic criteria were based on criteria described in WHO guidelines. AIDS-defining events were defined as diseases corresponding to WHO stage 4 or category C of CDC classification.From 2010 to 2016, 236 hospital admissions were included. AIDS-defining events were the most frequent cause of hospitalization (61.9%) with an increasing trend during the study period. Tuberculosis (28.4%), pneumocystis pneumonia (11.4%), cerebral toxoplasmosis (7.2%) and cryptococcosis (5.5%) were the most frequent AIDS-defining events. Tuberculosis was also the most frequent cause of overall hospitalization. In multivariate analysis, recent HIV diagnosis (aOR = 2.0, 95% CI: 1.0-3.9), CD4<200 cells/μl (aOR = 4.0, 95%CI: 1.9-8.1), persistent fever (aOR = 4.4, 95%CI: 2.1-9.0), duration of symptoms≥ 6 weeks (aOR = 2.6, 95%CI: 1.2-5.4) were associated with AIDS-defining events. Overall inpatient mortality was 19.5%. Age≥55 years (aOR = 4.9, 95%CI: 1.5-16.6), neurological signs (aOR = 3.2, 95%CI: 1.5-6.9) and AIDS-defining events (aOR = 2.9, 95%CI: 1.2--7.2) were associated with inpatient mortality.AIDS-defining events were the most frequent cause of hospitalization during the study period. Factors associated with AIDS-defining events mostly reflected delay in HIV diagnosis. Factors associated with mortality were advanced age, neurological signs and AIDS-defining events."
https://openalex.org/W2889361580,"Bordetella pertussis, the causative agent of whooping cough, has the capability to survive inside the host cells. This process requires efficient adaptation of the pathogen to the intracellular environment and the associated stress. Among the proteins produced by the intracellular B. pertussis we identified a protein (BP0414) that shares homology with MgtC, a protein which was previously shown to be involved in the intracellular survival of other pathogens. To explore if BP0414 plays a role in B. pertussis intracellular survival a mutant strain defective in the production of this protein was constructed. Using standard in vitro growth conditions we found that BP0414 is required for B. pertussis growth under low magnesium availability or low pH, two environmental conditions that this pathogen might face within the host cell. Intracellular survival studies showed that MgtC is indeed involved in B. pertussis viability inside the macrophages. The use of bafilomycin A1, which inhibits phagosome acidification, abolished the survival defect of the mgtC deficient mutant strain suggesting that in intracellular B. pertussis the role of MgtC protein is mainly related to the bacterial adaptation to the acidic conditions found inside the of phagosomes. Overall, this work provides an insight into the importance of MgtC in B. pertussis pathogenesis and its contribution to bacterial survival within immune cells."
https://openalex.org/W2889468687,"Anthrax is an endemic disease in China. Cases are reported every year, especially in the northwestern areas. In August 2016, an outbreak of 21 cutaneous anthrax cases was reported in Min County, Gansu Province, China. In this study, the general characteristics of the anthrax outbreak are described. Two molecular typing methods, canonical single-nucleotide polymorphism (canSNP) and multiple-locus variable-number tandem repeat analysis with 15 markers (MLVA15), were used to investigate the possible source of transmission and to identify the genetic relationship among the strains/samples isolated in this outbreak as well as previous isolates. In this outbreak, all patients were infected through contact with diseased livestock or contaminated animal products. Livestock had been introduced into the local area shortly before the outbreak from Gannan Prefecture (in Gansu Province), Sichuan and Qinghai Provinces. In the molecular typing analysis, there were two canSNP subgroups found in Gansu, A.Br.001/002 and A.Br.Ames, and five MLVA15 genotypes were observed. The strains collected from the anthrax outbreak in Min County in 2016 belonged to the A.Br.001/002 canSNP subgroup and the MLVA15-28 and MLVA15-30 genotype. Strains previously isolated from Sichuan, Inner Mongolia and Maqu County (in Gannan Prefecture, Gansu Province) were clustered with these outbreak-related strains/samples according to the MLVA15-30 genotype. The MLVA15-28 genotype was found in strains isolated from Gansu and Xinjiang in previous studies. Combining the epidemiological investigation and molecular typing results, we conclude that the patients in this outbreak were infected by a local pathogen present in the adjoining area of Gansu, Sichuan and Qinghai Provinces."

Woody plant encroachment is modified by local patterns of disturbance, topography, soil texture and fertility, and their relative importance and interaction strength varies among locations. We used grassland communities, Carletonville Dolomite Grassland (CDG), Rand Highveld Grassland (RHG) and abiotic factors (Soil Organic Carbon (SOC), Total nitrogen (TN), Phosphorus (P), Potassium (K), Sodium (Na), Calcium (Ca), Magnesium (Mg) and pH) to investigate habitat preferences of Seriphium plumosum L. in South African semi-arid grassland. Grassland community had a significant effect on S. plumosum density, canopy size, and on components of soil fertility (P< 0.05). Slope position had a significant effect on S. plumosum density and canopy size (P< 0.05). Seriphium plumosum density was significantly lower (23 plants/50 m2±2.39 (SE)) in CDG than in RHG (40 plants/50 m2±4.19). By contrast, S. plumosum canopy size was significantly higher (1.39 m2±0.11) at CDG than at the RHG (1.06 m2±0.08). The interaction of grassland community and slope position had a significant effect on S. plumosum density and soil sodium content (P< 0.05). Bottom slope regions in RHG (59.00 plants/50 m2±8.62) had higher S. plumosum density than bottom slope regions (19.75 plants/50 m2±3.01) in CDG. Soil sodium content was similar in CDG slopes and higher than in RHG slopes. Seriphium plumosum density was positively related to components of soil fertility; P (r2 = 0.1270; P 0.0036), K (r2 = 0.0786; P 0.0237), Na (r2 = 0.0686; P 0.0350), Ca (r2 = 0.0681; P 0.0358), and SOC content (r2 = 0.0669; P 0.0374). However, Seriphium plumosum canopy size did not show any relationship with components of soil fertility. This study revealed that S. plumosum density in grassland communities increased with increasing soil texture and fertility."

Large variation in colony structure exists, yet its implications and influence of oil distribution and diffusion dynamics are not known and could not be answered due to lack of suitable in vivo methods. This publication seeks to further the understanding on oil dynamics, by investigating naturally relevant large (700–1500μm) and extra-large (1500–2500μm) sized colonies of Botryococcus braunii (race B, strain Showa) in vivo, using a comprehensive approach of chemical shift selective imaging, chemical shift imaging and spin echo diffusion measurements at high magnetic field (17.6T). Hydrocarbon distribution in large colonies was found to be localised in two concentric oil layers with different thickness and concentration. Extra-large colonies were highly unstructured and oil was spread throughout colonies, but with large local variations. Interestingly, fluid channels were observed in extra-large colonies. Diffusion-weighted MRI revealed a strong correlation between colony heterogeneity, oil distribution, and diffusion dynamics in different parts of Botryococcus colonies. Differences between large and extra-large colonies were characterised by using T2 weighted MRI along with relaxation measurements. Our result, therefore, provides first non-invasive MRI means to obtain spatial information on oil distribution and diffusion dynamics in Botryococcus braunii colonies."
https://openalex.org/W2889342202,"While cognitive dissonance is an influential concept of social psychology, its relations with consciousness and episodic memory remain strongly debated. We recently used the free-choice paradigm (FCP) to demonstrate the crucial role of conscious memory of previous choices on choice-induced preference change (CIPC). After choosing between two similarly rated items, subjects reevaluated chosen items as more attractive, and rejected items as less attractive. However such a CIPC was present exclusively for items that were correctly remembered as chosen or rejected during the choice stage, both in healthy controls and in amnesic patients. In the present work, we show that CIPC can be modulated by suggestive quotes promoting self-coherence or self-incoherence. In addition to the crucial role of memory of previous choices, we discovered that memory of the suggestive quotes was correlated to the modulation of CIPC. Taken together these results suggest that CIPC reflects a dynamic homeostatic regulation of self-coherence."

Recently, polymer compound refractive lenses for focused illumination in the soft x-ray regime (< 10 keV) have been created with nano-printing. However, there are no such lenses yet for hard x-rays, particularly of short focal lengths for benchtop microscopy. We report the first instance of a nano-printed lens for hard x-ray microscopy, and evaluate its imaging performance. The lens consists of a spherically focusing compound refractive lens designed for 22 keV photon energy, with a tightly packed structure to provide a short total length of 1.8 mm and a focal length of 21.5 mm. The resulting lens technology was found to enable benchtop microscopy at 74x magnification and 1.1 μm de-magnified image pixel size at the object plane. It was used to image and evaluate the focal spots of tungsten-anode micro-focus x-ray sources. The overall system resolution with broadband illumination from a tungsten-anode x-ray tube at 30 kV and 10 mm focal distance was measured to be 2.30±0.22 μm."
https://openalex.org/W2889159809,"The ability to perceive changes in motion, such as rapid changes of speed, has important ecological significance. We show that exogenous and endogenous attention have different effects on speed-change perception and operate differently in different regions of the visual field. Using a spatial-cueing paradigm, with either exogenous or endogenous cues followed by drifting Gabor patches of changing speed that appear at the cued or uncued location, we measured participants’ thresholds for localizing both acceleration and deceleration of the Gabor patches in different regions (5° and 10°) of the visual field. The results revealed a larger exogenous cueing effect, indexed by a lower threshold for the cued relative to the uncued conditions, at 5° for perceiving acceleration and at 10° for perceiving deceleration. Endogenous attention, in contrast, improved performance equally at both eccentricities. We conclude that exogenous and endogenous spatial orienting constitute two independent attentional systems, with distinct modulation patterns on speed change perception in the visual field. While exogenous attentional modulation is eccentricity-dependent, endogenous attention acts homogeneously in perifoveal and near-peripheral regions of the visual field."

https://openalex.org/W2889203075,"Background The linkage of routine data collections are valuable for population-based evaluation of smoking cessation pharmacotherapy in pregnancy where little is known about the utilisation or safety of these pharmacotherapies antenatally. The use of routine data collections to study smoking cessation pharmacotherapy is limited by disparities among data sources. This study developed an algorithm to resolve disparity between the evidence of pharmacotherapy utilisation for smoking cessation and the recording of smoking in pregnancy, examined its face validity and assessed the implications on estimates of smoking cessation pharmacotherapy utilisation. Methods Perinatal records (n = 1,098,203) of women who gave birth in the Australian States of Western Australia and New South Wales (2004–2012) were linked to hospital admissions and pharmaceutical dispensing data. An algorithm, based on dispensing information about the type of smoking therapy, timing and quantity of supply reclassified certain groups of women as smoking during pregnancy. Face validity of the algorithm was tested by examining the distribution of factors associated with inaccurate recording of smoking status among women that the algorithm classified as misreporting smoking in pregnancy. Rate of utilisation among smokers, according to original and reclassified smoking status, was measured, to demonstrate the utility of the algorithm. Results Smoking cessation pharmacotherapy were dispensed to 2184 women during pregnancy, of those 1013 women were originally recorded as non-smoking as per perinatal and hospital data. Application of the algorithm reclassified 730 women as smoking during pregnancy. The algorithm satisfied the test of face validity—the expected demographic factors of marriage, private hospital delivery and higher socioeconomic status, were more common in women whom the algorithm identified as misreporting their smoking status. Application of the algorithm resulted in smoking cessation pharmacotherapy utilisation estimates ranging from 2.3–3.6% of all pregnancies. Conclusion Researchers can use the algorithm presented herein to improve the identification of smoking among women who use cessation pharmacotherapies during pregnancy. Improved identification can improve the validity of safety analyses of smoking cessation pharmacotherapy—providing clinicians with valuable evidence to use when counselling women on the role of pharmacotherapy for smoking cessation during pregnancy."
https://openalex.org/W2889533064,"Aims Likely pathogenic/pathogenic variants in genes encoding desmosomal proteins play an important role in the pathophysiology of arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC). However, for a substantial proportion of ARVC patients, the genetic substrate remains unknown. We hypothesized that plectin, a cytolinker protein encoded by the PLEC gene, could play a role in ARVC because it has been proposed to link the desmosomal protein desmoplakin to the cytoskeleton and therefore has a potential function in the desmosomal structure. Methods We screened PLEC in 359 ARVC patients and compared the frequency of rare coding PLEC variants (minor allele frequency [MAF] <0.001) between patients and controls. To assess the frequency of rare variants in the control population, we evaluated the rare coding variants (MAF <0.001) found in the European cohort of the Exome Aggregation Database. We further evaluated plectin localization by immunofluorescence in a subset of patients with and without a PLEC variant. Results Forty ARVC patients carried one or more rare PLEC variants (11%, 40/359). However, rare variants also seem to occur frequently in the control population (18%, 4754/26197 individuals). Nor did we find a difference in the prevalence of rare PLEC variants in ARVC patients with or without a desmosomal likely pathogenic/pathogenic variant (14% versus 8%, respectively). However, immunofluorescence analysis did show decreased plectin junctional localization in myocardial tissue from 5 ARVC patients with PLEC variants. Conclusions Although PLEC has been hypothesized as a promising candidate gene for ARVC, our current study did not show an enrichment of rare PLEC variants in ARVC patients compared to controls and therefore does not support a major role for PLEC in this disorder. Although rare PLEC variants were associated with abnormal localization in cardiac tissue, the confluence of data does not support a role for plectin abnormalities in ARVC development."
https://openalex.org/W2808912776,"A preference for organization is associated with several disorders, but is widespread in the general population as well. It remains unclear whether organization and various degrees of disorganization elicit pleasant or unpleasant feelings (i.e., valence), calming or arousing feelings (i.e., arousal), and a frontal negativity in the event-related potential (ERP) related to cognitive control. This study tested how organization, slight disorganization, and total disorganization affect valence, arousal, and the frontal negativity. Participants passively viewed organized, slightly disorganized, totally disorganized, and control pictures while their electroencephalogram was recorded. They also rated the valence and arousal elicited by each picture and completed questionnaires assessing desire for order and organization behavior. Organized pictures made participants feel most pleasant, control pictures made participants feel less pleasant, slightly disorganized pictures made participants feel even less pleasant, and totally disorganized pictures made participants feel least pleasant. There were no significant effects on arousal. Totally disorganized pictures elicited a frontal negativity in the ERP between 200-2000 ms after stimulus onset, which might reflect inhibition of rearranging behavior. Individual differences in desire for order and organization behavior did not correlate with valence, arousal, or the frontal negativity. The current study design and findings could be a starting point for examining the differences between adaptive and maladaptive preferences for organization and aversions to disorganization."
https://openalex.org/W2889036997,"The head-to-head AIDS Clinical Trial Group (ACTG) 5257 clinical trial found raltegravir (RAL) to be superior to atazanavir + ritonavir (ATV/r) and darunavir + ritonavir (DRV/r), when used in combination with emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (FTC/TDF) by treatment-naive adults with HIV-1 infection, in a 96-week composite endpoint combining virologic efficacy and tolerability. The objective of this study was to estimate the total HIV treatment costs associated with these three regimens in the United States. Methods Ninety-six–week costs for antiretroviral drugs, adverse event management, and HIV care for individuals initiating RAL, ATV/r, or DRV/r as first-line therapy for HIV-1 infection were estimated using an economic model. Efficacy and safety data (mean CD4 cell count changes, discontinuation rates, grade 3/4 adverse event incidence) for each regimen through 96 weeks of treatment were taken from the ACTG 5257 clinical trial. Antiretroviral drug costs for each initial regimen and for each substitution regimen, as used by individuals who discontinued their initial regimen, were based on wholesale acquisition costs. Adverse event management costs and HIV care costs, stratified by CD4 cell count range, were taken from published sources and inflated to 2016 dollars. Scenario and sensitivity analyses were conducted to assess the robustness of the results. Cost outcomes were discounted at an annual rate of 3.0%. Results Total 96-week costs were $81,231 for RAL, $88,064 for ATV/r, and $87,680 for DRV/r, where differences were primarily due to lower antiretroviral drug costs for RAL than for ATV/r or DRV/r. These results were found to be robust in scenario and sensitivity analyses. Conclusions Relative to the DRV/r and ATV/r regimens, the RAL regimen had the lowest cost for treatment-naive adults with HIV-1 infection in the United States."
https://openalex.org/W2889444068,"In oncology, extrapolation of clinical outcomes beyond trial duration is traditionally achieved by parametric survival analysis using population-level outcomes. This approach may not fully capture the benefit/risk profile of immunotherapies due to their unique mechanisms of action. We evaluated an alternative approach-dynamic modeling-to predict outcomes in patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma. We compared standard parametric fitting and dynamic modeling for survival estimation of nivolumab and everolimus using data from the phase III CheckMate 025 study.We developed two statistical approaches to predict longer-term outcomes (progression, treatment discontinuation, and survival) for nivolumab and everolimus, then compared these predictions against follow-up clinical trial data to assess their proximity to observed outcomes. For the parametric survival analyses, we selected a probability distribution based on its fit to observed population-level outcomes at 14-month minimum follow-up and used it to predict longer-term outcomes. For dynamic modeling, we used a multivariate Cox regression based on patient-level data, which included risk scores, and probability and duration of response as predictors of longer-term outcomes. Both sets of predictions were compared against trial data with 26- and 38-month minimum follow-up.Both statistical approaches led to comparable fits to observed trial data for median progression, discontinuation, and survival. However, beyond the trial duration, mean survival predictions differed substantially between methods for nivolumab (30.8 and 51.5 months), but not everolimus (27.2 and 29.8 months). Longer-term follow-up data from CheckMate 025 and phase I/II studies resembled dynamic model predictions for nivolumab.Dynamic modeling can be a good alternative to parametric survival fitting for immunotherapies because it may help better capture the longer-term benefit/risk profile and support health-economic evaluations of immunotherapies."
https://openalex.org/W2889527457,"This study investigated the stories of heterosexual women who experienced a husband coming out as gay and a consequential marital separation. Interpretative phenomenological analysis (IPA) was used. Loss, anger, spousal empathy and concerns regarding societal prejudice were reported. Additional stress was experienced when others minimised the experience due to the gay sexual orientation of their husband. Experiencing positive communication with their husband during and after the disclosure aided the resolution of the emotional injury experienced by them. They all eventually 'let go' of their husband. This involved a process of reconceptualising the self as separated. Findings indicate the importance of supporting women to re-focus on their needs during and following marital dissolution. The importance of non-judgemental support for marital loss, rather than a focus on the gay sexual orientation of the spouse, was highlighted."
