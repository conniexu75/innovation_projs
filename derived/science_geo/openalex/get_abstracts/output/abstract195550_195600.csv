https://openalex.org/W2050874415,"The contribution to environmental radioactivity of radioactivity due to fallout following the explosion of nuclear weapons is reviewed. Mechanisms by which /sup 90/Sr might be expected to enter the human body are discussed in detail. Data from nuclear weapons tests form the basis for the conclusion that the main part of the radioactivity from high-yield weapons dissipates in the stratosphere, but the small but very significant part that falls out within a few hundred miles of the site of the explosion of weapons fired on the surface constitutes a very real hazard. The weapons tests are therefore conducted with great attention to the dangers and every effort made to protect against misadventure. These local precautions should be entirely adequate and the worldwide health hazards from the present rate of testing are considered insignificant."

https://openalex.org/W2078667411,"A METHOD of producing a stabilized retinal image (that is, an image which is stationary on the retina) was first described in Nature
1, and other work has been reported elsewhere2–4. Here we describe a method of producing a stabilized image with interference fringes. A cylindrical unit 6 mm. in diameter and 3 mm. thick is formed by cementing a calcite crystal between two pieces of ‘Polaroid’. This unit is cemented to a steel ball which fits tightly into a ball-socket joint on a stalk fixed to a contact lens as shown in Fig. 1."

https://openalex.org/W2094506298,"CATTLE skin is abundantly supplied with sweat glands1, and these glands have been suggested to be functional2,3; but very little is known about the secretory control. Muto4 recorded that adrenaline produces marked sweating in horses and sheep but has no effect on the calf. Ferguson and Dowling3, on the other hand, observed the formation of sweat droplets in the calf in response to intradermal injections of adrenaline. Precise information, however, on whether the control of sweat glands of cattle is adrenergic and/or cholinergic is still lacking. We have therefore extended our experimental work on the cutaneous evaporation in cattle, in order to test the response of sweat glands to some of the drugs affecting the sympathetic nervous system."

https://openalex.org/W2070077980,"HOBSON1 showed that glycerol and/or dried preparations of the gut and salivary glands of Lucilia sericata Meig. showed strong proteinase activity but very little carbohydrase activity, only starch being hydrolysed, whereas maltose, sucrose and lactose were not hydrolysed at all. Since that report, these results have been quoted2 to support the plausible example of adaptation, wherein larval and adult blow-flies are assumed to possess digestive ability corresponding to their diet. Thus larvæ feeding on a protein-rich diet are adequately provided for because the gut shows strong proteolytic activity and the lack of carbohydrases is of no consequence. The reverse picture is presented in adult blow-flies which feed principally on carbohydrates; very active carbohydrases are present but only relatively weak proteinases."

https://openalex.org/W2073129942,"RAPIDITY and completeness of dialysis are favoured by a high concentration gradient at the membrane, which, in turn, depends on rapid transport of dialysable material to and from the membrane. At the same time, it is desirable in certain studies to obtain the permeate in the smallest possible volume, to simplify manipulation and to minimize the relative magnitude of analytical blank values. The apparatus is based on these considerations ; it is particularly suited for dialysis of suspended materials and can be used at temperatures between 0 and 100° C. We have employed it in the study of the soluble components of bacteria (in connexion with work conducted under a research contract (NONR-244(00) with the Office of Naval Research), the amount of dialysable material varying between 0.l and 40 mgm. of total nitrogen per experiment."
