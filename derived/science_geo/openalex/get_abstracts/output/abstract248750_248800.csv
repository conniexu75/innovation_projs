https://openalex.org/W1986903527,"Understanding the molecular mechanisms that regulate cellular proliferation and differentiation is a central theme of developmental biology. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of regulatory RNAs of ∼22 nucleotides that post-transcriptionally regulate gene expression1,2. Increasing evidence points to the potential role of miRNAs in various biological processes3,4,5,6,7,8. Here we show that miRNA-1 (miR-1) and miRNA-133 (miR-133), which are clustered on the same chromosomal loci, are transcribed together in a tissue-specific manner during development. miR-1 and miR-133 have distinct roles in modulating skeletal muscle proliferation and differentiation in cultured myoblasts in vitro and in Xenopus laevis embryos in vivo. miR-1 promotes myogenesis by targeting histone deacetylase 4 (HDAC4), a transcriptional repressor of muscle gene expression. By contrast, miR-133 enhances myoblast proliferation by repressing serum response factor (SRF). Our results show that two mature miRNAs, derived from the same miRNA polycistron and transcribed together, can carry out distinct biological functions. Together, our studies suggest a molecular mechanism in which miRNAs participate in transcriptional circuits that control skeletal muscle gene expression and embryonic development."

Like the more common Noonan syndrome (NS), LS is caused by germ line missense mutations in PTPN11, encoding the protein-tyrosine phosphatase Shp2. Enzymologic, structural, cell biological, and mouse genetic studies indicate that NS is caused by gain-of-function PTPN11 mutations. Because NS and LS share several features, LS has been viewed as an NS variant. We examined a panel of LS mutants, including the two most common alleles. Surprisingly, we found that in marked contrast to NS, LS mutants are catalytically defective and act as dominant negative mutations that interfere with growth factor/Erk-mitogen-activated protein kinasemediated signaling. Molecular modeling and biochemical studies suggest that LS mutations contort the Shp2 catalytic domain and result in open, inactive forms of Shp2. Our results establish that the pathogenesis of LS and NS is distinct and suggest that these disorders should be distinguished by mutational analysis rather than clinical presentation.

LS (MIM 151100) and NS (MIM 163950) are developmental disorders with many shared features. NS is characterized by facial dysmorphia, typically ocular hypertelorism, cardiac defects, most commonly pulmonary valve stenosis, and proportionate short stature. Cryptorchidism and deafness are also reported in NS patients (9Allanson J.E. Hall J.G. Hughes H.E. Preus M. Witt R.D. Am. J. Med. Genet. 1985; 21: 507-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar).

Both LS and NS are associated with increased risk of malignancy. However, acute myelogenous leukemia and neuroblastoma are associated with LS (12Keren B. Hadchouel A. Saba S. Sznajer Y. Bonneau D.

Gelb B.D. Annu. Rev. Genomics Hum. Genet. 2005; 6: 45-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). Somatic PTPN11 mutations are found in sporadic juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (∼35%), B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (∼7%), other childhood myeloproliferative or myelodysplastic disorders (1-5%), adult acute myelogenous leukemia (∼5%), and occasionally in neuroblastoma and other solid tumors (5Tartaglia M.

Shp2 is a ubiquitously expressed, non-receptor protein-tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) comprising two N-terminal SH2 domains, a catalytic (PTP) domain, and a C terminus with tyrosyl phosphorylation sites and a proline-rich stretch (14Neel B.G. Gu H. Pao L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2003; 28: 284-293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (971) Google Scholar). Via its SH2 domains, Shp2 binds directly to some growth factor receptors, such as the platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) receptor, as well as to several scaffolding adapters, including IRS, FGF receptor substrate (FRS), and Gab proteins. Formation of such complexes is required for full activation of the Ras/Erk cascade in most, if not all receptor-tyrosine kinase, cytokine receptor, and integrin signaling pathways. Consequently, Shp2 plays an important role in mediating multiple downstream biological responses, such as proliferation and/or survival, adhesion, and migration. All known biological functions of Shp2 require its catalytic activity (14Neel B.G. Gu H. Pao L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2003; 28: 284-293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (971) Google Scholar). Shp2 activity is tightly regulated by an elegant “molecular switch” mechanism that couples activation with recruitment of Shp2 to its binding proteins (14Neel B.G. Gu H. Pao L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2003; 28: 284-293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (971) Google Scholar, 15Hof P. Pluskey S. Dhe-Paganon S. Eck M.J. Shoelson S.E.

Structure. 1998; 6: 249-254Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). In the basal state (i.e. in unstimulated cells when Shp2 is found primarily in the cytoplasm), the “backside loop” of the N-SH2 domain (the side opposite to its phosphotyrosyl peptide binding pocket) interacts with the PTP domain, preventing substrate access to the active site (15Hof P. Pluskey S. Dhe-Paganon S. Eck M.J. Shoelson S.E. Cell. 1998; 98: 441-450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (756) Google Scholar). Binding to a phosphotyrosyl (Tyr(P)) protein ligand (e.g. in a receptor-tyrosine kinase or scaffolding adapter) alters the conformation of the N-SH2 domain, rendering it unable to bind the PTP domain and activating the enzyme (Fig. 1A). Earlier studies showed that mutating key contacts between the N-SH2 and the PTP domains led to biochemically and biologically “activated mutants” of Shp2 (17O'Reilly A.M. Pluskey S. Shoelson S.E. Neel B.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 20: 299-311Crossref Scopus (101) Google Scholar). A large number of NS mutants have been identified (1Tartaglia M. Gelb B.D. Annu. Rev. Genomics Hum. Genet. 2005; 6: 45-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar, 4Tartaglia M. Mehler E.L. Goldberg R. Zampino G. Brunner H.G. Kremer H. van der Burgt I. Crosby A.H. Ion A. Jeffery S. Kalidas K. Patton M.A. Kucherlapati R.S. Gelb B.D. Nat. Genet. 2001; 29: 465-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (1341) Google Scholar). Most of these disrupt key contacts between the N-SH2 and PTP domains, resulting in increased basal and stimulated PTP activity (18Fragale A. Tartaglia M. Wu J. Gelb B.D. Hum.

NS mutants (when co-transfected with the scaffolding adapter Gab1), enhance Erk mitogen-activated protein kinase activation in transient transfection assays (18Fragale A. Tartaglia M. Wu J. Gelb B.D. Hum. Mutat. 2004; 23: 267-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Erk is also hyperactivated in selected embryonic tissues from a mouse model of NS (21Araki T. Mohi M.G. F.A. I. Bronson R.T.

Neoplasia-associated PTPN11 mutations affect many of the same residues but typically are less conservative, resulting in greater catalytic activation (5Tartaglia M. Niemeyer C.M. Fragale A. Song X.

When expressed in hematopoietic cells, such mutants enhance basal and cytokine-evoked Erk, Akt, and Stat 5 activation (22Mohi M.G. Williams I.R. Dearolf C.R. Chan G. Kutok J.L. Cohen S. Morgan K.

Because NS and LS share multiple phenotypic features and are caused by PTPN11 mutations, they have been viewed as overlap syndromes (1Tartaglia M. Gelb B.D. Annu. Rev. Genomics Hum. Genet. 2005; 6: 45-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). We examined the enzymatic properties of LS mutants and their effects on receptor-tyrosine kinase signaling. Surprisingly, despite its phenotypic and genetic similarities to NS, we found that LS is caused by catalytically defective, loss-of-function mutations in PTPN11. Structural Interpretation and Molecular Modeling—The Shp2 structure 2SHP (Protein Data Bank), comprising the two SH2 domains plus the PTP domain and corresponding to the basal, inactive form of the enzyme in the absence of Tyr(P) peptide (15Hof P. Pluskey S. Dhe-Paganon S. Eck M.J. Shoelson S.E. Cell. 1998; 98: 441-450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (756) Google Scholar), and the predicted effects of various mutants were visualized using the PyMol Molecular Graphic System, Version 0.97 (DeLano Scientific). Expression Constructs and Protein Purification—Point mutations were introduced using the QuikChange kit (Stratagene). Wild type Shp2 (WT) and mutant Shp2 in pGEX-4T-2F, a modified version of pGEX-4T (Amersham Biosciences) that generates proteins with N-terminal GST- and C-terminal FLAG tags, were produced and purified on glutathione-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences), as described previously (20Keilhack H. David F.S. McGregor M. Cantley L.C. Neel B.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 30984-30993Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined by densitometric analysis of Coomassie-stained SDS-PAGE gels using bovine serum albumin as the standard. Purified enzymes were stored in the presence of 33% glycerol at -80 °C. PTP Assays—PTP assays using 32P-labeled carboxamido-methylated and -maleylated lysozyme (RCML) (typical specific activity ∼4000 cpm/pmol) as substrate were conducted in assay buffer (50 mm Hepes (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm EDTA, 2 μm RCML, and 5 nm GST-enzyme) with or without IRS-1 Tyr(P)-1172 (SLNpYIDLDLVK; pY is Tyr(P)) or Tyr(P)-1222 (LSTpYASINFQK) peptides as described (20Keilhack H. David F.S. McGregor M. Cantley L.C. Neel B.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 30984-30993Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Assays using para-nitrophenyl phosphate (pNPP, obtained from Sigma) as substrate were carried out in 30 mm Hepes (pH 7.4), 120 mm NaCl, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm pNPP, and 5 nm enzyme with or without various concentrations of Tyr(P)-peptide at 30 °C for 10 min and terminated with 0.2 n NaOH. Phosphate release was determined by measuring A410. Immune complex PTP assays were performed on lysates of transiently transfected 293 cells. Forty-eight hours after transfection, lysates from serum-starved or epidermal growth factor (EGF)-stimulated (50 ng/ml) cells were prepared, and Shp2 proteins were immunoprecipitated by using anti-Shp2 polyclonal antibodies (Santa Cruz) coupled to protein A-Sepharose. Shp2 immune complexes were washed 3 times in 1% Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (see below) without sodium orthovanadate and once in wash buffer (30 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 120 mm NaCl without pNPP). PTP assays were performed at 37 °C in 50 μl of pNPP assay buffer as described above. Recovered immune complexes were boiled in 2× SDS-PAGE sample buffer, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotted for Shp2 to control for equal Shp2 expression. All assays were carried out in triplicate. Cell Culture—293T cells were cultured at 37 °C and 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Sigma), 1% sodium pyruvate, and 1% penicillin-streptomycin. Transient Transfections—WT or mutant Shp2 cloned in the mammalian expression vector pBABE-puro (Invitrogen) were transfected into 293T cells using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). For some experiments, WT or mutant Shp2 (5 μg), were co-transfected with HA-Erk (0.5 μg) and/or HA-Gab-1 (2.0 μg). Twenty-four hours post-transfection cells were serum-starved for an additional 24 h and then either left unstimulated or stimulated with EGF (50 ng/ml), fibroblast growth factor (FGF)-2 (20 ng/ml), or PDGF (100 ng/ml) for various times. All growth factors were obtained from Calbiochem. Cells were lysed in 1 ml of Nonidet P-40 (1.0% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm Tris ·HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 2 mm NaVO3) or radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (1.0% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 25 mm Tris ·HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm NaVO3) plus a protease mixture (5 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml aprotinin; 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm benzamidine) and clarified in a microcentrifuge. Protein concentrations were measured by using Coomassie protein reagent. Proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE. Immunoblotting onto Immobilon P and detection by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) were performed essentially as described (21Araki T. Mohi M.G. F.A. I. Bronson R.T. Williams I.R. Kutok J.L. Pao L.I. Gilliland D.G. Epstein J.A. Neel B.G. Nat. Med. 2004; 10: 849-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). Rabbit polyclonal anti-Shp2 and anti-total Erk antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), anti-Gab1 antibodies (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.), anti-phospho-Erk1/2 antibodies (Cell Signaling Technology), and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit secondary antibodies (Amersham Biosciences) were all used according to their manufacturer's instructions. Stable Cell Lines—Retroviruses expressing WT or mutant Shp2 were generated by transient co-transfection of 293T cells with pBABE-puro constructs and AmphoPac (Invitrogen). Viral supernatants were collected 48 h post-transfection, passed through a 0.45-μm filter, and used to infect fresh 293T cells in the presence of 4 μg/ml Polybrene (Sigma). Forty-eight hours later cells were selected in 1 μg/ml puromycin (Sigma). Cell stimulations and analyses were performed as described above. LS Mutations Are Catalytically Inactive—In contrast to NS mutations, which are scattered throughout the Shp2 molecule, LS mutants are confined to the PTP domain (11Sarkozy A. Conti E. Digilio M.C.

Science. 1994; 263: 1397-1404Crossref PubMed Scopus (688) Google Scholar, 25Jia Z. Barford D. Flint A.J. Tonks N.K. Science. 1995; 268: 1754-1758Crossref PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar)), the six mutations specifically linked to LS (Y279(C/S), T468M, A461T, G464A, Q506P, Q510P) involve residues predicted to affect catalysis (26Denu J.E. Stuckey J.A. Saper M.A. Dixon J.E. Cell. 1996; 87: 361-364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). Three (Ala-461, Gly-464, and Thr-468) reside within the “signature motif” ((I/V)HCXAGXGR(S/T)GT) that defines the PTP family (26Denu J.E. Stuckey J.A. Saper M.A. Dixon J.E. Cell. 1996; 87: 361-364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar) and comprises the “PTP loop” in PTP structures (24Barford D. Flint A.J. Tonks N.K. Science. 1994; 263: 1397-1404Crossref PubMed Scopus (688) Google Scholar, 25Jia Z. Barford D. Flint A.J. Tonks N.K. Science. 1995; 268: 1754-1758Crossref PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar). The conserved cysteinyl residue within this motif carries out a nucleophilic attack on the substrate phosphotyrosyl residue, generating a thiophosphate intermediate that subsequently undergoes hydrolysis by a bound water molecule. Other signature motif residues are important for lowering the pKa (i.e. enhancing the nucleophilicity) of the catalytic cysteine, orienting the substrate for nucleophilic attack, maintaining the structural integrity of the catalytic pocket, and/or neutralizing the charge of the phosphotyrosine in the substrate (26Denu J.E. Stuckey J.A. Saper M.A. Dixon J.E. Cell. 1996; 87: 361-364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). Shp2 Tyr-279 is cognate to Tyr-46 in PTP1B, which sets the depth of the catalytic cleft and, thus, confers specificity for phosphotyrosine-containing substrates (24Barford D. Flint A.J. Tonks N.K.

Gln-506 or possibly Gln-510 is the Shp2 analog of Gln-262 in PTP1B, which helps position the water molecule to hydrolyze the thiophosphate intermediate (25Jia Z. Barford D. Flint A.J. Tonks N.K.

Based on their locations in the PTP catalytic cleft, we hypothesized that the LS mutations might have fundamentally different biochemical and biological properties than other disease-associated PTPN11 mutants. To begin to test this hypothesis, we expressed and purified GST-tagged wild type Shp2 (WT), the NS mutation D61G, the leukemia-associated mutant E76K, and several LS mutants as recombinant proteins in bacteria, as described previously (20Keilhack H.

Purified proteins were assayed against the artificial substrates pNPP and reduced carboxamido-methylated and -maleylated lysozyme (RCML). As expected (17O'Reilly A.M. Pluskey S. Shoelson S.E.

D61G had increased basal activity (compared with WT) that was further enhanced upon the addition of Tyr(P)-1172, whereas E76K was maximally activated even in the absence of Tyr(P) peptide. In contrast, none of the LS mutants exhibited detectable PTP activity against either substrate, even in the presence of saturating amounts of Tyr(P)-1172 (Fig. 2A) or over a wide range of doses of another activating phosphopeptide, Tyr(P)-1222, of IRS-1 (Fig. 2B). To exclude the possibility that the recombinant LS proteins produced in bacteria folded inappropriately and/or were unstable, mammalian expression constructs for (untagged) WT Shp2 and the indicated mutants were transiently transfected into 293T cells, which were then starved and either left unstimulated or stimulated with EGF. Endogenous (i.e. empty vector-transfected) Shp2 activity, as measured by immune complex PTP assay, was enhanced slightly upon growth factor stimulation (Fig. 2C). Cells transfected with WT Shp2 showed slightly higher basal and stimulated Shp2 activity, whereas those expressing the leukemia-associated E76K mutant showed markedly enhanced and constitutive Shp2 activity. However, transient expression of LS mutants led to no increase in PTP activity even though these mutants were expressed at levels comparable with WT Shp2 or E76K (Fig. 2C, bottom panel). Instead, LS mutants tended to cause decreased EGF-stimulated Shp2 activity (as measured by immune complex assay), raising the possibility that such mutants have dominant negative effects. LS Mutations Disrupt the Catalytic Pocket of Shp2—Examination of the Shp2 crystal structure (Fig. 1D) provided potential explanations for these observations. Because Tyr-279 sets the depth of the catalytic cleft, substitution by cysteine (or serine as in another LS patient (12Keren B. Hadchouel A. Saba S. Sznajer Y. Bonneau D. Leheup B. Boute O. Gaillard D. Lacombe D. Layet V. Marlin S. Mortier G. Toutain A. Beylot C. Baumann C. Verloes A. Cave H. J. Med. Genet. 2004; 41: 117-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar)) should alter the depth of the cleft and might also perturb the orientation of the catalytic cysteine (Figs. 3, A and B). Ala-461 is a highly conserved (see ptp.cshl.edu) PTP loop residue that also contacts Tyr-279; placing a bulkier threonyl substitution here should contort the catalytic site and interfere with substrate phosphotyrosine binding (Figs. 3, C and D). Gly-464 is an invariant signature motif residue in PTP superfamily members. Its replacement by alanine also should disrupt the PTP loop and sterically clash with the phosphate group of an incoming substrate phosphotyrosyl residue (Figs. 3, E and F). Thr-468 is a buried residue on the αG (α-4 in PTP1B) helix. Methionine substitution here probably would destabilize the entire PTP catalytic domain, with associated loss of enzymatic activity (Figs. 3, G and H). LS Mutants Are Dominant Negative—We next examined the effects of LS mutants on receptor-tyrosine kinase signaling. Expression constructs for WT or mutant Shp2, Gab1, and HA epitope-tagged Erk1 were co-transfected into 293T cells, as described previously (18Fragale A. Tartaglia M. Wu J. Gelb B.D. Hum. Mutat. 2004; 23: 267-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Transiently transfected cells were starved or stimulated with EGF, and total Tyr(P) (data not shown) and Erk activation was monitored by antiphospho-Erk immunoblotting (Fig. 4A). As expected, EGF stimulation activated Erk in WT-expressing cells, and Erk activation was enhanced to a much greater extent in cells expressing E76K or D61G. Expression of a mutant of the essential catalytic cysteinyl residue (C459S) inhibited Erk activation, as reported (28Bennett A.M. Hausdorff S.F. O'Reilly A.M. Freeman R.M. Neel B.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1189-1202Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Notably, the two most common LS mutants, Y279C and T468M, also had dominant negative effects, strongly inhibiting EGF-evoked Erk activation (Fig. 4A). Likewise, in stable cell pools expressing each mutant, D61G enhanced, whereas LS mutants strongly impaired, EGF-evoked Erk activation (Fig. 4B). Similar to the effects of Shp2 deficiency in fibroblasts (29Saxton T.M. Henkemeyer M. Gasca S. Shen R. Rossi D.J. Shalaby F. Feng G.-S. Pawson T.

Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 443-455Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar). Such features include a highly conserved trypsin-like serine protease domain and at least one PDZ domain at the C terminus. In addition, HtrA1 contains an insulin-like growth factor-binding protein domain and a Kazal-type serine protease inhibitor motif at its N terminus (2Zumbrunn J. Trueb B. FEBS Lett. 1996; 398: 187-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Originally identified as a gene down-regulated in SV40-transformed fibroblasts (2Zumbrunn J. Trueb B. FEBS Lett. 1996; 398: 187-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar), HtrA1 has since been implicated in the modulation of various disease pathologies. Recent reports suggest that HtrA1 plays a protective role in various malignancies because of its tumorsuppressive properties (3Shridhar V. Sen A. Chien J. Staub J. Avula R. Kovats S. Lee J. Lillie J.

Studies have shown that HtrA1 is down-regulated in cancerous tissue as compared with normal tissue and that overexpression results in the inhibition of tumor cell growth and proliferation both in vitro and in vivo (5Baldi A.

Oncogene. 2002; 21: 6684-6688Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). In contrast to tumor tissue, HtrA1 expression is up-regulated in skeletal muscle of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (7Bakay M. Zhao P. Chen J. Hoffman E. Neuromuscul. Disord. 2002; 12: S125-S141Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar) and in cartilage of osteoarthritic joints (8Hu S.I. Carozza M.

Therefore, up-regulation of HtrA1 in osteoarthritic joints may contribute to the development of this debilitating disease. Progressive degradation of components of the extracellular matrix plays an important role in the pathogenesis of arthritic diseases (9Sandell L.J. Aigner T. Arthritis Res. 2001; 3: 107-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar, 10Roughley P.J. Arthritis Res. 2001; 3: 342-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The destruction of the major cartilage components is driven by members of all classes of proteases, including serine proteases, although the matrix metalloproteases (MMPs) are considered to be the primary instigators (11Vincenti M.P. Brinckerhoff C.E. Arthritis Res. 2002; 4: 157-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar, 12Mort J.S. Billington C.J.

English W. Hutton M. Stracke J. Clark I. Arthritis Res. 2002; 4: S39-S49Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). Within the cartilage matrix, interstitial collagens are the main targets of degradative collagenases such as MMP-1 (collagenase-1) (11Vincenti M.P. Brinckerhoff C.E. Arthritis Res. 2002; 4: 157-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar, 12Mort J.S. Billington C.J. Arthritis Res. 2001; 3: 337-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). The primary function of these MMPs is in the degradation of native fibrillar collagen, resulting in the generation of collagen fragments that are then further cleaved by gelatinases, MMP-2 and MMP-9, and stromelysin (MMP-3) (12Mort J.S. Billington C.J. Arthritis Res. 2001; 3: 337-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). However, for collagenases to gain access to these substrates, small proteoglycans and interfibrillar cross-links must first be removed (12Mort J.S. Billington C.J. Arthritis Res. 2001; 3: 337-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Recently, it was suggested that several proteoglycans and glycoproteins in the extracellular matrix may serve as potential substrates for HtrA1 (20Tocharus J. Tsuchiya A. Kajikawa M. Ueta Y. Oka C. Kawaichi M. Dev. Growth Differ. 2004; 46: 257-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 21Murwantoko Yano M. Ueta Y. Murasaki A. Kanda H. Oka C. Kawaichi M. Biochem.

In the present study, we have demonstrated a potential direct and indirect involvement of HtrA1 in cartilage destruction in arthritic diseases. Materials—Dulbecco's modified eagle medium, Dulbecco's calcium- and magnesium-free phosphate-buffered saline, heat-inactivated bovine calf serum, l-glutamine, penicillin and streptomycin, collagenase Type I were obtained from Invitrogen. 3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5 diphenyltetrazolium bromide, thiazolyl blue, 3,3′,5,5′tetramethylbenzidine, hydrocortisone, insulin, and transferrin were obtained from Sigma. Human recombinant interleukin 1β was obtained from R&D Systems Inc. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin was from Amersham Biosciences, and fibronectin was purchased from Chemicon. All oligo-primers used were purchased from MWG Biotech. Antibodies—A monoclonal HtrA1 antibody was generated against recombinant purified HtrA1 (amino acids 141–480) using previously described approaches (23Caterson B. Christner J.E. Baker J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 8848-8854Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Polyclonal HtrA1 antibody was produced by injecting purified recombinant HtrA1 (amino acids 141–480) from Escherichia coli into rabbits. Isolation of Human Synovial Fibroblasts (HSF)—HSF were isolated, harvested, and cultured using a method previously described (24Dayer J.M. Krane S.M. Russell R.G. Robinson D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 73: 945-949Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar). Briefly, synovial tissue was obtained after synovectomy from patients with osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis under approval of the local Ethics Committees. Samples were washed with Dulbecco's calcium- and magnesium-free phosphate-buffered saline prior to digestion with collagenase (750 units/ml in phosphate-buffered saline) for 1 h at 37°C. After digestion, the synovial fibroblasts were expanded in culture flasks containing Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and nutrient mix F12 (1:1) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, penicillin (50 international units/ml), streptomycin (50 μg/ml), l-glutamine (0.3 mg/ml), hydrocortisone (4 μg/ml), insulin (250 μg/ml), and transferrin (250 μg/ml). Cells were grown in a humidified incubator at 37 °C containing 5% CO2 in air. At least four separate cell lines were cultured and used between passages 3 and 5. 3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5 diphenyltetrazolium Bromide Cell Proliferation Assay—Cell viability was assessed using the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5 diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay as previously described (25van de Loosdrecht A.A. Nennie E. Ossenkoppele G.J. Beelen R.H. Langenhuijsen M.M. J. Immunol. Methods. 1991; 141: 15-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). This assay was used throughout cell culture experiments as standard to confirm that cell numbers/viability were comparable. HtrA1 ELISA—HtrA1 protein levels within synovial fluid and cultured supernatant samples were determined using an HtrA1-specific ELISA developed in-house. Briefly, ELISA plates were coated overnight with monoclonal α-HtrA1 (1:100) and blocked with 5% bovine serum albumin/phosphate-buffered saline. Plates were washed with 0.05% Tween/phosphate-buffered saline and incubated with samples for 2 h at 30 °C. After washing, polyclonal α-HtrA1 (1:500) was added for 1 h at 30 °C followed by a biotin-conjugated swine α-rabbit (1:5000) (Dako Cytomation) for 1 h at 30 °C. HtrA1 was detected using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin (1:500). Plates were developed using 3,3′,5,5′tetramethylbenzidine in 100 mm citric acid, 0.1% H2O2, pH 3.95. The reaction was stopped with 7% H2SO4 and optical densities determined at 450 nm using a plate reader (Dynex). Purified recombinant HtrA1 (amino acids 141–480) was tested at concentrations ranging from 156 pg/ml to 10 ng/ml to generate a standard curve. Cloning, Expression, and Purification of HtrA1—The expression vector pCTH1 is a derivative of pQE60 (Qiagen) containing the lacIQ gene (26Harnasch M. Grau S. Dove S. Hochschild N. Iskandar M.-K. Xia W. Ehrmann M. Mol. Membr. Biol. 2004; 21: 373-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). pSG7 expresses codons 141–480 of htrA1 under tac promoter control (isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside inducible). It was constructed by cloning a PCR fragment via NcoI/BglII into pCTH1. E. coli strain CLC198 (MC4100 degP:Tn10) overproducing recombinant HtrA1 (amino acids 141–480) was lysed by French pressing in buffer I (50 mm NaH2PO4, pH 7.5, 300 mm NaCl, 1 m urea) followed by centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 30 min. Precleared cell lysate was loaded on a Ni2+-NTA Superflow column (Qiagen) at a flow rate of 0.3 ml/min. The column was washed with buffer II (50 mm NaH2PO4, pH 7.5, 300 mm NaCl) and buffer III (50 mm NaH2PO4, pH 7.5, 300 mm NaCl, 35 mm imidazole) prior to elution in buffer IV (50 mm NaH2PO4, pH 7.5, 300 mm NaCl, 500 mm imidazole). Fractions of 1 ml were collected and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Purified protein was stored in aliquots in storage buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, 300 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol) at –70 °C. Endotoxin levels in purified HtrA1 were found to be at acceptable levels (<10 pg/ml) as determined by the Limulus assay. Zymography—HtrA1 (2 μg) was loaded on a precast zymogram containing casein as substrate (Bio-Rad) and developed following the manufacturer's instructions. Identification of Potential HtrA1 Substrates in Synovial Fluid—Synovial fluids (10 μl) identified as containing low levels of HtrA1 were incubated with or without recombinant HtrA1 (5 μg) for 3 h at 37°C and then analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Candidate protein substrates were then extracted from the SDS gel and identified using mass spectrometry. Proteolytic Enzyme Assays—Inhibition of HtrA1 proteolytic activity by HtrA1 inhibitor (1-{3-cyclohexyl-2-[(naphthalene-2-carbonyl)-amino]-propionyl}-pyrrolidine-2-carboxylic acid [5-(3-cyclohexyl-ureido)-1-dihydroxyboranyl-pentyl]-amide) obtained from Novartis was determined by preincubation of HtrA1 with various concentrations of the inhibitor (20, 70, 150, 200, 300, 400, and 500 nm) prior to adding the substrate (resorufin-labeled casein). Samples were incubated overnight at 37 °C in the dark. The reaction was stopped by trichloroacetic acid precipitation and the supernatant mixed with 600 μl of 0.5 m Tris-HCl, pH 9.5. The absorbance was determined at 574 nm. Degradation of fibronectin was determined by incubation of various amounts of recombinant HtrA1 (0.5, 1, 3, and 5 μg) with 10 μg of fibronectin in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, 150 mm NaCl for 3 or 18 h at 37 °C. Fibronectin (10 μg) and HtrA1 (5 μg) were incubated separately under the same conditions and served as controls. HtrA1 inhibitor was preincubated with HtrA1 for 20 min at room temperature at a final concentration of 1, 2, or 5 μm prior to the addition of fibronectin substrate. Samples were analyzed on a Coomassie-stained Schaegger gel. Identification of MMP mRNA by RT-PCR—mRNA from human synovial fibroblasts was isolated using TRIzol according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). cDNA was synthesized from pd(N)6-primed mRNA reverse transcribed using M-MLV superscript reverse transcriptase as previously described (27Richards P.J. Amos N. Williams A.S. Williams B.D. Rheumatology (Oxf.). 1999; 38: 984-991Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Reaction mixtures for PCR consisted of 50 mm KCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 9.0, 0.1% Triton X-100 and 2.5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm deoxynucleotide triphosphates, 1 pmol of each primer, 16 pg of cDNA, and 0.5 units of Taq polymerase (Promega). PCR was performed on a thermal cycler (Tpersonal; Biometra). Human mRNA specific for the housekeeping gene α-actin was measured and used as an internal control. Reaction times were optimized for α-actin, MMP-1, -2, -3 and TIMP-1, -3 and were 94 °C for an initial 2 min, followed by either 30 cycles for α-actin, MMP-2, TIMP-1, and TIMP-3 or 40 cycles for MMP-1 and -3 of 94 °C for 15 s, 53 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 1 min. The reaction was completed with a 7-min extension at 72 °C. The primers for α-actin (204 bp) were 5′-GGA GCA ATG ATC TTG ATC TT-3′ for the upstream primer and 5′-TCC TGA GGT ACG GGT CCT TCC-3′ for the downstream primer; MMP-1 (449 bp) 5′-TCC CAG CGA CTC TAG AAA CAC AAG-3′for the upstream primer and 5′-CCG ATG ATC TCC CCT GAC AAA AG-3′for the downstream primer; MMP-2 (619 bp) 5′-TTT TCT CGA ATC CAT GAT GG-3′for the upstream primer and 5′-CTG GTG CAG CTC TCA TAT TT-3′for the downstream primer; MMP-3 (434 bp) 5′-AGC TTC AGT GTT GGC TGA G-3′for the upstream primer and 5′-CAG GTG TGG AGT TCC TGA C-3′for the downstream primer; TIMP-1 (320 bp) 5′-CAA TTC CGA CCT CGT CAT CAG-3′ for the upstream primer and 5′-GTC CAC AAG CAA TGA GTG CC-3′ for the downstream primer; TIMP-3 (410 bp) 5′-CTT CTG CAA CTC CGA CAT CG-3′ for the upstream primer and 5′-CAG GCG TAG TGT TTG GAC TG-3′ for the downstream primer. Ethidium bromide (0.005%)-stained agarose gels were photographed using the GelDoc-It imaging system (Jencons-PLC). Quantification of Secreted MMP-3—MMP-3 protein levels in culture supernatants were determined using an MMP-3-specific ELISA kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (R&D Systems Inc.). Effect of Fibronectin Fragments on MMP and TIMP Expression—To prepare fibronectin fragments, 10 μg of fibronectin was incubated with 5 μg of HtrA1 for 16 h at 37 °C in buffer in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, 150 mm NaCl. Subsequently, these samples were applied with and without 5 μm HtrA1 inhibitor to synovial fibroblasts for 24 h before determining MMP and TIMP mRNA levels by RT-PCR. Statistical Analysis—Two-tailed Student's t-test was used to determine statistical significance between values. A p value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant. Values are expressed as the mean ± S.E. Hu et al. (8Hu S.I. Carozza M. Klein M. Nantermet P. Luk D. Crowl R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34406-34412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar) reported a 7-fold increase in both the expression of HtrA1 mRNA and HtrA1 protein in cartilage explants from osteoarthritic patients as compared with normal individuals. To investigate the potential importance of HtrA1 in the progression of arthritis, initial studies were carried out to determine the level of HtrA1 in synovial fluids. In the present study, the role of HtrA1 in arthritic diseases was further investigated and its possible mechanisms of action elucidated. Identification of HtrA1 in Synovial Fluid—HtrA1 levels within synovial fluids from either OA or RA patients were determined by ELISA using purified recombinant HtrA1 as a standard reference (Fig. 1, inset). HtrA1 levels in arthritic patients were compared with those detected in synovial fluids taken from non-arthritic trauma patients. HtrA1 levels were elevated in OA (38 ± 6 ng/ml) and RA (19 ± 4 ng/ml) synovial fluids as compared with non-arthritic individuals (5 ± 1 ng/ml) (Fig. 1). HtrA1 Secretion by Human Synovial Fibroblasts—To identify potential sources of HtrA1 in synovial fluids, the secretion of HtrA1 by HSF isolated from either OA or RA patients was determined using the HtrA1-specific ELISA. Levels of HtrA1 secreted by human foreskin fibroblasts were also analyzed and served as a non-arthritic control. HtrA1 levels were significantly elevated in supernatants from OA and RA HSF as compared with human foreskin fibroblasts at all time points tested (Fig. 2). Production, Purification, and Inhibition of Recombinant HtrA1—To further analyze the effects of HtrA1 in the context of arthritis, we generated a recombinant His-tagged HtrA1 lacking the N-terminal insulin-like growth factor-binding protein and serine protease inhibitor domain in E. coli (Fig. 3A). Affinity-purified HtrA1 was >98% pure as determined by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 3B, lane 1) and was recognized by the monoclonal HtrA1 antibody (lane 2). In addition, this HtrA1 construct was confirmed to be proteolytically active as shown by zymography (lane 3). This truncated version of HtrA1 is thought to be of physiological relevance as HtrA1 possesses autoproteolytic activity generating N-terminal truncations in in vitro translation (8Hu S.I. Carozza M. Klein M. Nantermet P. Luk D. Crowl R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34406-34412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar) as well as cell culture systems (data not shown). An additional tool for these studies was a potent inhibitor of HtrA1 that was obtained from a high throughput screen (Fig. 3C). In the presence of this HtrA1 inhibitor, proteolytic activity was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner with an IC50 of 0.21 μm as determined by HtrA1-dependent digestion of resorufin-labeled casein (Fig. 3D). Identification of Potential Substrates of HtrA1—The identification of substrates naturally occurring within the joint would be beneficial for investigating the role of HtrA1 in this destructive disease. The potential of cartilage matrix degradation has been previously demonstrated by the ability of HtrA1 to digest small proteoglycans such as decorin and biglycan (20Tocharus J. Tsuchiya A. Kajikawa M. Ueta Y. Oka C. Kawaichi M. Dev. Growth Differ. 2004; 46: 257-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 22Tsuchiya A. Yano M. Tocharus J. Kojima H. Fukumoto M. Kawaichi M. Oka C. Bone. 2005; 37: 323-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). To identify possible substrates of HtrA1 within arthritic joints, OA and RA synovial fluids low in HtrA1 (OA, 6.2 ng/ml; RA 2.2 ng/ml) were digested with purified recombinant HtrA1, and degraded proteins were identified by SDS-PAGE followed by mass spectrometry. Among the candidate substrates identified, fibronectin was considered to be of particular interest because of its involvement in maintenance of cartilage matrix integrity through its interaction with collagen (28Sottile J. Hocking D.C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 3546-3559Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). In addition, elevated levels of fibronectin fragments produced following proteolytic degradation have been detected in both OA and RA synovial fluids (29Burton-Wurster N. Lust G. Macleod J.N. Matrix Biol. 1997; 15: 441-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 30Clemmensen I. Holund B. Johansen N. Andersen R.B.

These fragments may play an important role in arthritic diseases because of their ability to stimulate chondrocytes and synovial fibroblasts to produce MMPs (35Homandberg G.A. Meyers R. Xie D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3597-3604Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 36Homandberg G.A. Kang Y. Zhang J. Cole A.A. Williams J.M.

J. 2002; 364: 181-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Protease assays with purified components were performed to confirm fibronectin degradation. Various amounts of recombinant HtrA1 were incubated with 10 μg of fibronectin for 3 and 18 h at 37 °C. A fragment of fibronectin migrating at ∼30 kDa could be detected after 3 h of incubation with 3 and 5 μg of HtrA1 (Fig. 4A). Further incubation of fibronectin with HtrA1 for 18 h led to generation of additional fibronectin fragments ranging from 50 to 175 kDa that increased in intensity with increasing amounts of HtrA1 (Fig. 4A). The most prominent fibronectin fragment generated after 18 h was the 30-kDa fragment. Fibronectin degradation was completely abolished by addition of 5 μm HtrA1 inhibitor. In addition, inhibition of HtrA1-dependent fibronectin digestion was investigated by preincubating HtrA1 with 1, 3, or 5 μm HtrA1 inhibitor prior to adding fibronectin. Degradation of fibronectin was completely abolished by addition of 3 and 5 μm HtrA1 inhibitor (Fig. 4B). The appearance of HtrA1 as one or two bands after prolonged incubation is due to its autoproteolytic activity. Inhibition of HtrA1 also inhibits autoproteolytic activity resulting in only one HtrA1 band. Effect of Recombinant HtrA1 on MMP/TIMP Production by HSF—Fibronectin fragments are present in micromolar levels in synovial fluid of arthritic joints and have been shown to up-regulate MMP production in human synovial fibroblasts and chondrocytes (34Homandberg G.A. Front. Biosci. 1999; 4: D713-D730Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 35Homandberg G.A. Meyers R. Xie D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3597-3604Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 37Stanton H.

Acta. 1989; 184: 133-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). To investigate the potential regulatory effects of HtrA1 on cellular functions resulting from the production of fibronectin fragments, we examined MMP expression in HSF following incubation with recombinant HtrA1. In addition, we investigated the effects of HtrA1 on expression of the naturally occurring inhibitors of MMPs (tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinases, TIMPs). Both OA and RA HSF were incubated for 24 h in serum-free conditions with and without increasing amounts of recombinant HtrA1. The expression of MMP-1, -2, -3 and TIMP-1 and -3 was determined by semi-quantitative PCR. MMP-1 and -3 mRNA levels were markedly increased in both OA and RA HSF treated with HtrA1. In contrast, expression of MMP-2, TIMP-1, and TIMP-3 remained unaffected by HtrA1 (Fig. 5, A and B). These stimulatory effects of HtrA1 were almost completely abolished following addition of 5 μm HtrA1 inhibitor (Fig. 5, A and B), suggesting that the proteolytic activity of HtrA1 is crucial for up-regulation of MMPs. In contrast, the HtrA1 inhibitor had no effect on the regulation of MMP synthesis in response to the pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin 1 (Fig. 5C), confirming the specificity of the HtrA1 inhibitor. To determine whether the stimulatory effects of HtrA1 on MMP regulation could also been observed at the protein level, MMP-3 release was monitored by a specific ELISA. MMP-3 was constitutively secreted by both OA (130 ± 20 pg/ml) and RA (70 ± 20 pg/ml) HSF (Fig. 4, D and E). These levels were increased >100-fold in OA (15,720 ng/ml ± 4,370 pg/ml) and 7-fold in RA (500 pg/ml ± 40 pg/ml) HSF following incubation with 2.5 μg/ml of HtrA1 for 24 h (Fig. 5, D and E). Consistent with our previous results, these stimulatory effects of HtrA1 were abolished by the addition of 5 μm HtrA1 inhibitor. Effect of Fibronectin Fragments on MMP Production by HSF—To confirm that the up-regulation of MMP-1 and MMP-3 production by HtrA1 was mediated through the generation of fibronectin fragments, HSF were incubated with HtrA1-digested human fibronectin. Stimulation of HSF with fibronectin fragments for 24 h resulted in a marked increase in the expression of MMP-1 and MMP-3 (Fig. 6). These effects were specifically due to fibronectin fragments, as undigested fibronectin alone had little or no effect. Furthermore, incubation with HtrA1 inhibitor confirmed that these effects were predominantly because of the fibronectin fragments and not contaminating HtrA1. Fibronectin fragments had no effect on TIMP-1 or -3 expression levels. We point out that in the absence of HtrA1 or fibronectin fragments the basal levels of MMP mRNA detected in cells derived from OA patients can be heterogeneous (Figs. 5 and 6). The reason for the observed differences is unknown, although they might be best explained by the heterogeneity of the clinical condition itself, for example by alterations in disease phenotype between individuals (39Tolboom T.C. Pieterman E. van der Laan W.H. Toes R.E. Huidekoper A.L. Nelissen R.G. Breedveld F.C. Huizinga T.W. Ann. Rheum. Dis. 2002; 61: 975-980Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). HtrA1 levels in cartilage explants from OA patients have previously been shown to be increased 7-fold as compared with cartilage from non-arthritic individuals (8Hu S.I. Carozza M. Klein M. Nantermet P. Luk D. Crowl R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34406-34412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). In addition, in vitro studies have demonstrated that cartilage damage can induce a significant increase in HtrA1 production by resident chondrocytes (20Tocharus J. Tsuchiya A. Kajikawa M. Ueta Y. Oka C. Kawaichi M. Dev. Growth Differ. 2004; 46: 257-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). By using an HtrA1-specific ELISA, we have demonstrated that HtrA1 levels are also increased 3–7-fold in the synovial fluids from both OA and RA patients, with a significantly higher level of HtrA1 being detected in OA synovial fluid. Thus, HtrA1 levels could serve as an additional marker for diagnosis of disease. Further analyses revealed that HSF extracted from OA and RA joint tissue constitutively secrete HtrA1. This up-regulation of HtrA1 production appeared to be disease specific, as human foreskin fibroblasts secreted 2–3-fold less HtrA1 than OA and RA HSF. The secretion of HtrA1 by OA and RA HSF suggests that the synovial membrane may also be an important source of HtrA1 within the arthritic joint, in addition to the articular cartilage. Although both OA and RA HSF secrete HtrA1, it is perhaps the highly active state of OA chondrocytes that accounts for the differences seen in the levels of HtrA1 in OA and RA synovial fluid (20Tocharus J. Tsuchiya A. Kajikawa M. Ueta Y. Oka C. Kawaichi M. Dev. Growth Differ. 2004; 46: 257-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Destruction of articular cartilage is a common feature of OA and RA (9Sandell L.J. Aigner T. Arthritis Res. 2001; 3: 107-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar, 10Roughley P.J. Arthritis Res. 2001; 3: 342-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). We identified the extracellular matrix glycoprotein fibronectin as a natural substrate of HtrA1, suggesting a direct role of HtrA1 in matrix degradation. HtrA1 effectively degraded purified human fibronectin, generating fragments of various sizes including several prominent fragments ranging from 83 to 170 and 29–30 kDa. Elevated levels of fibronectin fragments ranging from 24 to 200 kDa have been identified both in OA and RA synovial fluid in micromolar concentrations (34Homandberg G.A. Front. Biosci. 1999; 4: D713-D730Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 38Griffiths A.M. Herbert K.E. Perrett D. Scott D.L. Clin. Chim. Acta. 1989; 184: 133-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) and are involved in the regulation of numerous cellular activities (40Xie D.L. Meyers R. Homandberg G.A. Blood. 1993; 81: 186-192Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 41Wachtfogel Y.T. Abrams W. Kucich U. Weinbaum G. Schapira M. Colman R.W. J. Clin. Investig. 1988; 81: 1310-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The central involvement of fibronectin fragments in cartilage catabolism is highlighted by their ability to decrease proteoglycan synthesis (42Xie D. Hui F. Homandberg G.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 307: 110-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) and enhance the release of several MMPs (34Homandberg G.A. Front. Biosci. 1999; 4: D713-D730Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 37Stanton H. Ung L. Fosang A.J. Biochem. J. 2002; 364: 181-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). In the present report, we have demonstrated that HtrA1 has the potential to up-regulate MMP expression and secretion in arthritic joints through activation of HSFs. Regulation of MMP-1 and -3 expression in HSF by HtrA1 was shown to be dependent on the production of fibronectin fragments. Therefore, we suggest that HtrA1 degrades fibronectin present within the cell culture system and the resulting fibronectin fragments instigate the expression and secretion of MMPs. Additional evidence was provided from the findings that neither HtrA1 nor fibronectin fragments had any effect on TIMP-1 and -3 expression by HSF as has previously been reported (34Homandberg G.A. Front. Biosci. 1999; 4: D713-D730Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The present study provides evidence for a detrimental role of HtrA1 in both OA and RA, leading to a working hypothesis for its biological functions in this context. Not only does HtrA1 have the potential to directly degrade cartilage through proteolytic cleavage of extracellular matrix components such as fibronectin, cartilage oligomeric matrix protein, biglycan, decorin, fibromodulin, aggrecan, and reduced collagen (20Tocharus J. Tsuchiya A. Kajikawa M. Ueta Y. Oka C. Kawaichi M. Dev. Growth Differ. 2004; 46: 257-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 21Murwantoko Yano M. Ueta Y. Murasaki A. Kanda H. Oka C.

Bone. 2005; 37: 323-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), but it seems also to act indirectly through its ability to stimulate the overproduction of MMPs by synovial fibroblasts. Therefore, specific inhibition of HtrA1 production or activity in arthritic joints may serve as a novel therapeutic strategy for treatment of arthritic diseases. We thank Novartis Pharma for providing HtrA1 inhibitor and David Farley and Bob Crowl for discussions."

As SR-BI is expressed at high levels in the intestine, the present study addressed the involvement of SR-BI in vitamin E trafficking across enterocytes. Apical uptake and efflux of the main dietary forms of vitamin E were examined using Caco-2 TC-7 cell monolayers as a model of human intestinal epithelium. (R,R,R)-γ-tocopherol bioavailability was compared between wild-type mice and mice overexpressing SR-BI in the intestine. The effect of vitamin E on enterocyte SR-BI mRNA levels was measured by real-time quantitative reverse transcription-PCR. Concentration-dependent curves for vitamin E uptake were similar for (R,R,R)-α-, (R,R,R)-γ-, and dl-α-tocopherol. (R,R,R)-α-tocopherol transport was dependent on incubation temperature, with a 60% reduction in absorption at 4 °C compared with 37 °C (p < 0.05). Vitamin E flux in enterocytes was directed from the apical to the basal side, with a relative 10-fold reduction in the transfer process when measured in the opposite direction (p < 0.05). Co-incubation with cholesterol, γ-tocopherol, or lutein significantly impaired α-tocopherol absorption. Anti-human SR-BI antibodies and BLT1 (a chemical inhibitor of lipid transport via SR-BI) blocked up to 80% of vitamin E uptake and up to 30% of apical vitamin E efflux (p < 0.05), and similar results were obtained for (R,R,R)-γ-tocopherol. SR-BI mRNA levels were not significantly modified after a 24-h incubation of Caco-2 cells with vitamin E. Finally, (R,R,R)-γ-tocopherol bioavailability was 2.7-fold higher in mice overexpressing SR-BI than in wild-type mice (p < 0.05).

Vitamin E is a fat-soluble micronutrient that occurs in nature in eight different forms: (R,R,R)-α-, -β-, -γ-, and -δ-tocopherol and (R,R,R)-α-, -β-, -γ-, and -δ-tocotrienol. The human diet mainly provides (R,R,R)-α-tocopherol (RRR-α-T) 2The abbreviations used are: RRR-α-T, (R,R,R)-α-tocopherol; RRR-γ-T, (R,R,R)-γ-tocopherol; dl-α-T, dl-α-tocopherol; SR-BI, scavenger receptor class B type I; FBS, fetal bovine serum; Tg, transgenic (mice overexpressing SR-BI); PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography. and (R,R.,R)-γ-tocopherol (RRR-γ-T), whereas supplements generally supply vitamin E as dl-α-tocopherol (dl-α-T) or dl-α-tocopherol acetate. Although a recent study has described the fate of vitamin E in the human digestive tract (1Borel P. Pasquier B. Armand M. Tyssandier V. Grolier P. Alexandre-Gouabau M.C. Andre M. Senft M. Peyrot J.

However, recent data suggest that the absorption of fat-soluble micronutrients is more complex than previously thought. More precisely, several transporters, i.e. ABC transporters (3Brewer Jr., H.B.

Interestingly, recent data add support to the hypothesis of involvement of SR-BI in vitamin E transport in the enterocyte. First, SR-BI is expressed at substantial levels in the intestine (9Levy E.

Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 2028-2040Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar), were prepared as described previously (7Reboul E. Abou L. Mikail C. Ghiringhelli O. Andre M. Portugal H. Jourdheuil-Rahmani D. Amiot M.J. Lairon D. Borel P. Biochem. J. 2005; 387: 455-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar) to obtain the following final concentrations: 0.04 mm phosphatidylcholine, 0.16 mm lysophosphatidylcholine, 0.3 mm monoolein, 0.1 mm free cholesterol, 0.5 mm oleic acid, 5–90 μm tocopherol (1Borel P. Pasquier B. Armand M. Tyssandier V. Grolier P. Alexandre-Gouabau M.C. Andre M. Senft M. Peyrot J. Jaussan V. Lairon D. Azais-Braesco V. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: G95-G103Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and 5 mm taurocholate. The concentration of tocopherol in the micellar solutions was checked before each experiment. For delivery of tocopherol to mice, emulsions were prepared as follows. An appropriate volume of tocopherol stock solution was transferred to Eppendorf tubes to obtain a final amount of 5 mg in each tube. Stock solution solvent was carefully evaporated under nitrogen. Dried residue was solubilized in 100 μl of Isio-4 vegetable oil (Lesieur, Asnières-sur-Seine, France), and 200 μl of physiological serum were added. The mixture was vigorously mixed in ice-cold water in a sonication bath (Branson 3510) for 15 min and used for force-feeding within 10 min. Caco-2 clone TC-7 cells (15Salvini S. Charbonnier M.

Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 213-225Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were a gift from Dr. M. Rousset (INSERM U178, Villejuif, France). Cells were cultured in the presence of Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium supplemented with 20% heat-inactivated FBS, 1% non-essential amino acid, and 1% antibiotics (complete medium) as described previously (7Reboul E. Abou L. Mikail C. Ghiringhelli O. Andre M. Portugal H. Jourdheuil-Rahmani D. Amiot M.J. Lairon D. Borel P. Biochem. J. 2005; 387: 455-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). For each experiment, cells were seeded and grown on transwells as described previously (7Reboul E. Abou L. Mikail C. Ghiringhelli O. Andre M. Portugal H. Jourdheuil-Rahmani D. Amiot M.J. Lairon D. Borel P. Biochem. J. 2005; 387: 455-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar) to obtain confluent differentiated cell monolayers. Twelve hours prior to each experiment, the medium used in apical and basolateral chambers was a serum-free complete medium. During preliminary tests, the integrity of the cell monolayers was checked by measuring transepithelial electrical resistance before and after the experiment using a Millicell-ERS voltohmmeter fitted with a chopstick electrode (Millipore, Saint-Quentin-en-Yvelines, France). At the beginning of each experiment, cell monolayers were washed twice with 0.5 ml of PBS. For uptake experiments, the apical or basolateral side of the cell monolayers received the tocopherol-rich micelles, whereas the other side received the serum-free complete medium. Cells were incubated for 15 min at either 37 or 4 °C depending on the experiment. Incubation time was chosen after a preliminary experiment measuring maximal absorption rate to obtain sufficient amounts of absorbed tocopherol for accurate measurements. At the end of each experiment, media from each side of the cell monolayer were harvested. Cells were washed twice in 0.5 ml of ice-cold PBS containing 10 mm taurocholate, to eliminate adsorbed tocopherol, and then scraped and collected in 2 ml PBS. Absorbed tocopherol was estimated as tocopherol found in scraped cells plus tocopherol found on the opposite side of the cell monolayer (the basolateral side when micellar tocopherol was added to the apical side, and vice versa). For apical efflux experiments, the cells first received the tocopherolrich micelles at the apical side for 60 min. They were then washed three times with PBS and received apical medium containing vitamin E acceptors, i.e. vitamin E-free mixed micelles. Aliquots of apical medium were taken at different times and replaced by the same volume of new medium. All of the samples were stored at –80 °C under nitrogen with 0.5% pyrogallol as a preservative before tocopherol extraction and HPLC analysis. Aliquots of cell samples without pyrogallol were used to assess protein concentrations using a bicinchoninic acid kit (Pierce). With Cholesterol—RRR-α-T and RRR-γ-T uptake was measured after incubation of vitamin E-rich mixed micelles (70.4 μm) containing either no cholesterol, 0.1 mm cholesterol (control), or 0.2 mm cholesterol. With Other Microconstituents—RRR-α-T and RRR-γ-T uptake was measured after incubation of vitamin E-rich mixed micelles (final concentration, 40 μm) containing either no other microconstituent, RRR-γ-T (final concentration of 40 μm when RRR-α-T uptake was measured), RRR-α-T (final concentration of 40 μm when RRR-γ-T uptake was measured), or carotenoids (final concentration: 6.0 μm lutein, 2.8 μm β-carotene, or 0.4 μm lycopene). Test for Localization of SR-BI in Apical or Basolateral Membranes of Caco-2 TC-7 Cells—Biotinylation of cell monolayers and dot blotting were performed as described previously (7Reboul E. Abou L. Mikail C. Ghiringhelli O. Andre M. Portugal H. Jourdheuil-Rahmani D. Amiot M.J. Lairon D. Borel P. Biochem. J. 2005; 387: 455-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Blots were then incubated with mouse anti-human SR-BI IgG at 1/1000 dilution. Anti-mouse IgG were used as secondary antibodies at a 1/5000 dilution for visualization. Tocopherol Apical Transport Inhibition by Anti-human SR-BI Antibody—For uptake experiments, cell monolayers were incubated for 2 min with 3.75 μg/ml anti-human SR-BI monoclonal antibody raised against the external domain before tocopherol-rich micelles were added for 60 min. Previous experiments have shown that this antibody concentration allows a maximal inhibition of absorption (7Reboul E. Abou L. Mikail C. Ghiringhelli O. Andre M. Portugal H. Jourdheuil-Rahmani D. Amiot M.J. Lairon D. Borel P. Biochem. J. 2005; 387: 455-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Anti-human SR-BI antibody raised against the C-terminal domain, which is located at the internal side of the apical membrane, was used as a control at 3.75 μg/ml (17Jourdheuil-Rahmani D. Charbonnier M. Domingo N. Luccioni F. Lafont H. Lairon D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 292: 390-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). For efflux experiments, tocopherol-enriched cells (see previous section on uptake and efflux measurements) received apical medium containing 3.75 μg/ml anti-human SR-BI antibody and vitamin E-free mixed micelles (as acceptors) for up to 24 h. Tocopherol Apical Transport Inhibition by BLT1—BLT1 cytotoxicity had been controlled previously using a CellTiter 96 Aqueous One Solution assay (Promega, Madison, WI) (7Reboul E. Abou L. Mikail C. Ghiringhelli O. Andre M. Portugal H. Jourdheuil-Rahmani D. Amiot M.J. Lairon D. Borel P. Biochem. J. 2005; 387: 455-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). These control experiments showed that BLT1 was not toxic up to 10 μm. The effect of BLT1 on tocopherol uptake was assessed as follows. Cell monolayers were pretreated with either Me2SO (control) or BLT1 at 10 μm for 1 h. The cells then received tocopherol-rich mixed micelles with 10 μm BLT1 for 60 min, and uptake was measured as described above. For efflux experiments, tocopherol-enriched cells received apical medium supplemented with either Me2SO or BLT1 at 10 μm and vitamin E-free mixed micelles (as acceptors) for up to 6 h. Efflux was measured as described above. Transgenic (Tg) mice were created as follows. The SR-BI cDNA was obtained by digestion of pRC/CMV vector by restriction enzymes HindIII and XbaI. The apolipoprotein C III enhancer (–500/–890 bp)apolipoprotein A IV promoter (–700 bp) was excised from pUCSHCAT plasmids using restriction enzymes XbaI and HindIII. The construct containing the apolipoprotein C III enhancer-apolipoprotein A IV promoter to the intestinal specificity and the 1.8-kilobase cDNA fragment of murine SR-BI was cloned into the XbaI site of the pc DNA 1.1 vector. A linearized fragment of the construct, obtained by digestion of the vector by restriction enzymes SalI and AvrII, was used to generate transgenic mice by standard procedures on a B6D2 background. Detailed information on the characteristics of SR-BI Tg mice are provided in a study by Bietrix et al. (18Bietrix F. Daoguang Y. Nauze M. Rolland C. Bertrand-Michel J. Coméra C. Shaak S. Barbaras R. Groen A.K. Perret B. Tercé F. Collet X. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; (January 18)10.1074/jbc.M508868200Google Scholar). RNA analysis showed that SR-BI Tg mice had a 25-fold increase of SR-BI in the intestine as compared with wild-type mice. Immunocytochemistry confirmed the intestinal overexpression of SR-BI in Tg mice and showed that the protein was located at the same sites as found in wild-type mice. The mice were housed in a temperature-, humidity- and light-controlled room. They were given a standard chow diet with water ad libitum. They were fasted overnight before each experiment. On the day of the experiment, a first blood sample was obtained at fasting (zero base-line sample) by cutting the extremity of the tails. The mice were then force-fed with a (R,R,R)-γ-tocopherol-enriched emulsion. Additional blood samples were taken at 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 10, and 24 h after the force-feeding. Plasma samples were stored at –80 °C until vitamin E analysis was done by HPLC. Tocopherol was extracted from 500 μl of aqueous samples using the following method. Distilled water was added to sample volumes below 500 μl to reach a final volume of 500 μl. Tocol, which was used as the internal standard, was added to the samples in 500 μl of ethanol. The mixture was extracted once with one volume of hexane. The hexane phase obtained after centrifugation (500 × g, 10 min, 4 °C) was evaporated to dryness under nitrogen, and the dried extract was dissolved in 100 μl of methanol. A volume of 5–20 μl was used for HPLC analysis. RRR-α-, RRR-γ-, dl-α-T, and tocol were separated using a 250 × 4.6-nm RP C18,5-μm Zorbax column (Interchim, Montluçon, France) and a guard column. The mobile phase was 100% methanol. Flow rate was 1.5 ml/min, and the column was kept at a constant temperature (30 °C). The HPLC system comprised a Dionex separation module (P680 HPLC pump and ASI-100 automated sample injector, Dionex, Aix-en-Provence, France) and a Jasco fluorimetric detector (Jasco, Nantes, France). Tocopherols were detected at 325 nm after light emission at 292 nm and were identified by retention time compared with pure (>95%) standards. Quantification was performed using Chromeleon software (version 6.50, SP4 Build 1000) comparing the peak area with standard reference curves. All solvents used were HPLC grade from sodium dodecyl sulfate (Peypin, France). Differentiated cell monolayers cultivated on filters were incubated with either 80 μm RRR-α-T-rich micelles, 80 μm RRR-γ-T-rich micelles, or tocopherol-free micelles (controls) for 24 h. Total RNA was isolated from the cells using RNA II nucleospinTM kits (Macherey-Nagel, Düren, Germany). The cDNA was prepared by reverse transcription of 1 μg of total RNA using random hexamers as primers. An equivalent volume of 5 μl of cDNA solution was used for quantification of specific cDNA by real-time quantitative reverse transcription-PCR. The sequences of the primers for 18 S RNA, used as an internal standard for sample normalization, have been published previously (19Burnichon V. Jean S. Bellon L. Maraninchi M. Bideau C. Orsiere T. Margotat A. Gerolami V. Botta A. Berge-Lefranc J.L. Toxicol. Lett. 2003; 143: 155-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The sequences of the forward and reverse human SR-BI primers were 5′-CGGCTCGGAGAGCGACTAC-3′ and 5′-GGGCTTATTCTCCATCATCACC-3′, respectively. Real-time quantitative reverse transcription-PCR reactions were performed in duplicate on an ABI PRISMTM 7700 sequence detection system (PE Applied Biosystems) using SYBR Green kits (Eurogentec, Angers, France) in line with the manufacturer’s instructions. A melt curve peak analysis was performed at the end of all real-time PCR runs to ensure that only the correct product was amplified. The relative levels of SR-BI mRNA were calculated as recommended by the manufacturer using the comparative ΔΔCt method (User Bulletin No. 2, ABI PRISM 7700 sequence detection system, PE Applied Biosystems) and then analyzed as described by Livak and Schmittgen (20Livak K.J. Schmittgen T.D. Methods (San Diego). 2001; 25: 402-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (124899) Google Scholar). Results are expressed as means ± S.D. The Differences between the two groups of unpaired data were tested using the nonparametric Mann-Whitney U test. Values of p < 0.05 were considered significant. All statistical analyses were performed using Statview software, version 5.0 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC). Relationships between the two variables were examined by regression analysis on KaleidaGraph version 3.6 software (Synergy software, Reading, PA). Increasing amounts of RRR-α-T, RRR-γ-T, or dl-α-T, corresponding to theoretical final concentrations ranging from 2.5 to 90 μm, were added to the lipid mixture during micelle preparation, and the concentrations of tocopherol recovered in the mixed micelles was measured. The incorporation of all three tocopherols increased linearly (data not shown). RRR-α-T and RRR-γ-T absorbed by the differentiated monolayers increased curvilinearly for up to 60 min of incubation for both a high (40 μm) and a low (2.5 μm) concentration (data not shown). At incubation times less than 15 min and at the lower concentration, the amounts of tocopherol absorbed were insufficient for accurate measurement. Thus, to remain as close as possible to the initial absorption rate and to obtain adequate tocopherol absorption, we decided to work at 15 min of incubation. Competition studies were performed at 30 min, which represents approximately the time during which the bowel content remains in contact with duodenal cells during digestion (21Bernier J.J. Adrian J. Vidon N. Les Aliments dans le Tube Digestif. Doin Editeurs, Paris1988Google Scholar). Finally, some absorption experiments were carried out at 60 min to increase the differences between groups. Absorption of RRR-α-T, RRR-γ-T, and dl-α-T was not linear (Fig. 1). The best fits were the hyperbolic curves y = ax/(x + b), R2 > 0.99. Apparent Qmax and K values were calculated (Table 1). Qmax represents maximal amount of tocopherol absorbed, and K represents the concentration of micellar tocopherol required to reach Qmax/2. Note that these values likely depend on micelle composition. There was no significant difference between vitamin E species in terms of affinity for a potential transporter (K values).TABLE 1Parameters of tocopherol absorption as a function of micellar tocopherol concentrations in differentiated Caco-2 TC-7 cell monolayersVitamin E speciesApparent QmaxApparent Knmol of tocopherol absorbed/mg of proteinμmRRR-α-T7.5 ± 0.684.3 ± 9.9RRR-γ-T6.5 ± 0.583.9 ± 11.5dl-α-T5.6 ± 0.788.3 ± 15.2 Open table in a new tab Table 2 shows that there was (i) a significant decrease in RRR-α-T and RRR-γ-T absorption at 4 °C compared with that at 37 °C and (ii) a drastic fall (up to 93.7%) in RRR-α-T and RRR-γ-T absorption when vitamin E-rich micelles were supplied at the basolateral side compared with the apical side.TABLE 2Effect of temperature and transport direction on RRR-α-tocopherol and RRR-γ-tocopherol absorption by differentiated Caco-2 TC-7 cell monolayers(R,R,R)-α-Tocopherol absorption(R,R,R)-γ-Tocopherol absorptionRRR-α-T micellar concentration4°CBasolateral to apicalRRR-γ-T micellar concentration4°CBasolateral to apicalμm% of control% of controlμm% of control% of control1529.5 ± 6.96.3 ± 0.01948.6 ± 5.79.3 ± 0.53146.4 ± 9.66.6 ± 2.54146.5 ± 4.96.6 ± 1.65242.0 ± 8.06.5 ± 0.98850.0 ± 18.28.7 ± 0.1 Open table in a new tab Cholesterol is naturally present in micelles during digestion but in concentrations that increase or decrease depending on diet and biliary secretion.

Conversely there was no significant effect of β-carotene and lycopene on RRR-α-T absorption, but it should be noted that the micellar concentrations of these carotenoids were necessarily lower than for lutein because of their naturally lower solubility in micelles. Similar results were obtained with RRR-γ-T (data not shown).TABLE 4Effect of (R,R,R)-γ-tocopherol and carotenoids on (R,R,R)-α-tocopherol absorption by differentiated Caco-2 TC-7 cell monolayersExperimental conditionsRRR-α-T absorption% of control40 μm RRR-α-T + 40 μm RRR-γ-T59.5 ± 11.9aSignificantly different from the control (RRR-α-T-rich micelles plus microconstituent-free mixed micelles).40 μm RRR-α-T + 6.0 μm lutein78.9 ± 6.7aSignificantly different from the control (RRR-α-T-rich micelles plus microconstituent-free mixed micelles).40 μm RRR-α-T + 2.8 μm β-carotene80.6 ± 10.140 μm RRR-α-T + 0.4 μm lycopene97.0 ± 0.7a Significantly different from the control (RRR-α-T-rich micelles plus microconstituent-free mixed micelles). Open table in a new tab The biotinylation experiment that we performed demonstrated that SR-BI is located mainly at the apical membrane of Caco-2 TC7 cells, according to our previous work (7Reboul E. Abou L. Mikail C. Ghiringhelli O. Andre M. Portugal H. Jourdheuil-Rahmani D. Amiot M.J. Lairon D. Borel P. Biochem. J. 2005; 387: 455-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Uptake Experiment—Fig. 2 shows that the addition of anti-human SR-BI antibody raised against the external domain significantly decreased RRR-α-T and RRR-γ-T apical absorption (by about 20%). Conversely, and as expected, the control antibody, i.e. the anti-human SR-BI antibody raised against an internal domain, did not impair vitamin E absorption (data not shown). The specific chemical inhibitor of SR-BI (BLT1) also significantly decreased RRR-α-T and RRR-γ-T absorption (by up to 80%). Apical Efflux Experiment—The apical effluxes of both RRR-α-T and RRR-γ-T (data not shown) increased dramatically (∼300% after 24 h) when a putative physiological acceptor of vitamin E, in this case vitamin E-free mixed micelles, was added to the apical medium (Fig. 3). Adding either anti-human SR-BI antibody raised against the external domain or BLT1 at the apical side of the cells in the presence of vitamin E-free mixed micelles significantly reduced the apical efflux of RRR-α-T (Fig. 4) and RRR-γ-T (data not shown, but similar for this vitamin).FIGURE 4Effect of anti-human SR-BI antibody and BLT1 on RRR-α-T apical efflux by differentiated Caco-2 TC-7 cell monolayers. Cells were enriched in RRR-α-T, and the apical side then received either FBS-free medium containing tocopherol-free mixed micelles (•) or the same mixture plus anti-human SR-BI antibody (▵, A) or plus BLT1 (▵, B). The basolateral side received FBS-free medium. Aliquots of apical medium were taken at different times and replaced by the same volume of new medium.

Plasma RRR-γ-T response (expressed as area under the postprandial 0–24-h curves) after force-feeding with RRR-γ-T-enriched emulsion was significantly higher in SR-BI Tg mice than in control mice (106.9 ± 21.0 μmol·h/liter versus 54.9 ± 22.5 μmol·h/liter) (p = 0.0062; Fig. 5A). Plasma RRR-γ-T response remained significantly higher in SR-BI Tg mice than in wild-type mice after lipid adjustment of the vitamin E response (35.7 ± 8.4 μmol·h/g of lipid versus 17.0 ± 6.9 μmol·h/g of lipid, p = 0.0062, Fig. 5B). To study in detail the mechanisms involved in vitamin E transport across the enterocyte, we used the frequently employed Caco-2 TC-7 cell model, which gives reproducible figures that correlate closely with human in vivo data (22Artursson P. Karlsson J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 175: 880-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (1683) Google Scholar). Our first result confirms that RRR-α-T, RRR-γ-T, and dl-α-T show similar absorption patterns. This is in full agreement with previous studies in which there was no intestinal discrimination between α-tocopherol stereoisomers (23Kiyose C. Muramatsu R. Fujiyama-Fujiwara Y. Ueda T. Igarashi O. Lipids. 1995; 30: 1015-1018Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) or between α- and γ-T forms (24Traber M.G. Kayden H.J. Am. J. Clin. Nutr. 1989; 49: 517-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Taken together, the saturable uptake of vitamin E, the temperature dependence, and the direction dependence strongly argue in favor of a protein-mediated uptake (25Artursson P. Karlsson J. Ocklind G. Schipper N. Epithelia Cell Culture: A Practical Appraoch. IRL Press at Oxford University Press, Oxford, England1995: 111-133Google Scholar). However, the possibility cannot be excluded that a fraction of vitamin E was absorbed by passive diffusion because of the 30–50% absorption observed at 4 °C. After having demonstrated that a least a fraction of vitamin E was absorbed through a receptor-mediated process, the question that arises is “what transporter(s) is involved?” The best candidate is SR-BI, as its involvement in vitamin E trafficking has been demonstrated in several tissues (10Goti D.

Neurochem. 2004; 89: 939-950Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). The finding that RRR-α-T and RRR-γ-T uptake in Caco-2 cells was inhibited by both anti-human SR-BI antibody and BLT1, which is a specific chemical inhibitor of SR-BI (27Nieland T.J. Penman M. Dori L. Krieger M. Kirchhausen T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 15422-15427Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 28Nieland T.J. Chroni A. Fitzgerald M.L. Maliga Z. Zannis V.I. Kirchhausen T. Krieger M. J. Lipid Res. 2004; 45: 1256-1265Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), is taken as initial evidence that SR-BI is involved in tocopherol uptake. The difference in inhibition efficiency between the antibody and the chemical inhibitor can be explained by the fact that the antibody was monoclonal, and consequently its high site specificity may lead to only a partial inhibition of SR-BI. The fact that we did not manage to fully inhibit tocopherol absorption suggests that other means of transport (passive diffusion or via other transporters) are involved. To further examine the involvement of SR-BI in tocopherol absorption, we compared tocopherol bioavailability between wild-type mice and mice overexpressing SR-BI in the intestine. To do this, we used RRR-γ-T instead of RRR-α-T, for three reasons. First, as shown in this study in Caco-2 cells and as reported previously in a clinical study by Traber et al. (29Traber M.G. Burton G.W. Hughes L. Ingold K.U. Hidaka H. Malloy M. Kane J. Hyams J. Kayden H.J. J. Lipid Res. 1992; 33: 1171-1182Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), there is no intestinal discrimination between RRR-γ-T and RRR-α-T, making it possible to choose between either of these isomers. Second, mice bred in-house had RRR-γ-T plasma concentrations close to zero, making RRR-γ-T equivalent to a tracer to measure newly absorbed tocopherol. Finally, because hepatic α-TTP discriminates between tocopherol isomers and resecretes more α-T than γ-T in very low density lipoproteins, using γ-tocopherol generates less contamination of plasma tocopherol by tocopherol from hepatic origin and thus provides a better evaluation of tocopherol secreted by the intestine, i.e. newly absorbed tocopherol. The results obtained in mice provide further evidence that SR-BI is involved in tocopherol absorption. Having obtained evidence that SR-B1 is involved in the apical uptake of tocopherols, and given that this transporter is involved in both lipid uptake and efflux (30Wagner K.H. Kamal-Eldin A. Elmadfa I. Ann. Nutr. Metab. 2004; 48: 169-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar), the obvious question was “is this transporter involved in the apical efflux of tocopherol as well?” The fact that both anti-human SR-BI antibody and BLT1 inhibited tocopherol efflux from enterocytes to the apical side suggests that SR-BI also plays a role in intestinal tocopherol reverse transport. Given that the main dietary sources of vitamin E are (R,R,R)-α- and (R,R,R)-γ-tocopherol and that both vitamers are transported through the SR-BI, we raised the question of whether there was competition between these two forms of vitamin E. This is an important issue, as γ-tocopherol has different biological properties than α-tocopherol, and it has been suggested that a high consumption of vitamin E supplements, which contain mostly α-tocopherol, may impair γ-tocopherol bioavailability, which would explain the disappointing results of large scale clinical trials designed to evaluate the effects of vitamin E on cardiovascular diseases (31Violi F.

The significant inhibition of RRR-γ-T absorption when 40 μm RRR-α-T was added (and vice versa), together with the finding that α-tocopherol concentrations in the human gut range between 100–600 μm following the intake of a 440 mg vitamin E supplement (1Borel P. Pasquier B. Armand M. Tyssandier V. Grolier P. Alexandre-Gouabau M.C. Andre M. Senft M. Peyrot J. Jaussan V. Lairon D. Azais-Braesco V. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: G95-G103Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), shows that competition between these forms of vitamin E likely occurs in vivo. Because SR-BI is also involved in the intestinal uptake of lutein (7Reboul E. Abou L. Mikail C. Ghiringhelli O. Andre M. Portugal H. Jourdheuil-Rahmani D. Amiot M.J. Lairon D. Borel P. Biochem. J. 2005; 387: 455-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar) (a carotenoid that, like tocopherol, is an isoprenoid), it is possible that carotenoids may impair tocopherol absorption. We therefore performed competition studies between RRR-α-T or RRR-γ-T and carotenoids. These experiments showed that lutein, but not β-carotene and lycopene, impaired tocopherol absorption. This difference can be explained by the necessarily lower concentration of lycopene and β-carotene able to have been incorporated into micelles (lutein is more soluble in micelles than the other two carotenoids). These results suggest that cholesterol, carotenoids, and vitamin E may compete for transport by SR-BI. This is consistent with in vivo studies that have shown that vitamin E decreases canthaxanthin absorption in the rat (32Hageman S.H. She L. Furr H.C. Clark R.M. Lipids. 1999; 34: 627-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) and that a diet supplementation with 400 IU α-T/day reduces serum concentrations of γ- and δ-T in humans (33Huang H.Y. Appel L.J. J. Nutr. 2003; 133: 3137-3140Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Finally, although the physiopathological consequences of our findings remain unknown, we suggest that inter-individual variations in SR-BI expression or efficiency may explain the highly significant inter-individual variability in tocopherol absorption (34Cheeseman K.H.

Loss of desmosome function is associated with severe congenital and acquired disorders characterized by tissue fragility. Pemphigus vulgaris (PV) is an autoimmune disorder in which antibodies are directed against the desmosomal adhesion molecule Dsg3, resulting in severe mucosal erosions and epidermal blistering. To define the mechanisms by which Dsg3 autoantibodies disrupt keratinocyte adhesion, the fate of PV IgG and various desmosomal components was monitored in primary human keratinocytes exposed to PV patient IgG. PV IgG initially bound to keratinocyte cell surfaces and colocalized with desmosomal markers. Within 6 h after PV IgG binding to Dsg3, electron microscopy revealed that desmosomes were dramatically disrupted and keratinocyte adhesion was severely compromised. Immunofluorescence analysis indicated that PV IgG and Dsg3 were rapidly internalized from the cell surface in a complex with plakoglobin but not desmoplakin. Dsg3 internalization was associated with retraction of keratin filaments from cell-cell borders. Furthermore, the internalized PV IgG-Dsg3 complex colocalized with markers for both endosomes and lysosomes, suggesting that Dsg3 was targeted for degradation. Consistent with this possibility, biotinylation experiments demonstrated that soluble Dsg3 cell surface pools were rapidly depleted followed by loss of detergent-insoluble Dsg3. These findings demonstrate that Dsg3 endocytosis, keratin filament retraction, and the loss of keratinocyte cell-cell adhesion are coordinated responses to PV IgG.

These findings demonstrate that Dsg3 endocytosis, keratin filament retraction, and the loss of keratinocyte cell-cell adhesion are coordinated responses to PV IgG. Desmosomes are adhesive intercellular junctions that mediate tight adhesion between epithelial cells (1Getsios S. Huen A.C. Green K.J. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 5: 271-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar, 2Yin T. Green K.J. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2004; 15: 665-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Desmosomes are particularly prominent in tissues that experience mechanical stress, such as the skin and heart, and function as plasma membrane attachment sites for intermediate filaments. The importance of desmosomes in tissue function and integrity has been revealed by numerous genetic and autoimmune disorders that impact desmosomal components (3Cheng X. Koch P.J. J. Dermatol. 2004; 31: 171-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 4Payne A.S. Hanakawa Y. Amagai M. Stanley J.R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2004; 16: 536-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The desmosomal cadherins, the desmogleins and desmocollins, are the transmembrane components of desmosomes responsible for mediating cell-cell adhesion (5Garrod D.R. Merritt A.J. Nie Z. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2002; 14: 537-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). The tails of the desmosomal cadherins interact with the cytoplasmic protein plakoglobin along with other related proteins to couple the cadherins to desmoplakin and the intermediate filament cytoskeleton (2Yin T. Green K.J. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2004; 15: 665-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 6Kowalczyk A.P. Bornslaeger E.A. Norvell S.M. Palka H.L. Green K.J. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1999; 185: 237-302Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A number of desmoglein and desmocollin isoforms have been identified, and the genes encoding these proteins are expressed in a tissue- and differentiation-specific manner (5Garrod D.R. Merritt A.J. Nie Z. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2002; 14: 537-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 7Angst B.D. Marcozzi C. Magee A.I. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 629-641Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mutations in genes encoding desmosomal components lead to heart and skin disorders (3Cheng X. Koch P.J. J. Dermatol. 2004; 31: 171-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 8Protonotarios N. Tsatsopoulou A. Cardiovasc. Pathol. 2004; 13: 185-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 9Chidgey M. Histol. Histopathol. 2002; 17: 1179-1192PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, autoantibodies directed against the desmosomal cadherins lead to a class of severe epidermal blistering disorders termed pemphigus (10Anhalt G.J. Diaz L.A. J. Am. Acad. Dermatol. 2004; 51: S20-S21Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). These disorders underscore the importance of understanding how desmosomes assemble, disassemble, and contribute to tissue architecture and function. The mechanisms by which intercellular junctions assemble and disassemble are not fully understood. However, recent work has focused attention on cadherin endocytosis as a means by which cells maintain a dynamic state of cell-cell contact (11Kowalczyk A.P. Reynolds A.B. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2004; 16: 522-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 12D'Souza-Schorey C.

Trends Cell Biol. 2004; 14: 427-434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). E-cadherin has been shown to be internalized and recycled back to the plasma membrane in a constitutive manner (14Le T.L. Yap A.S. Stow J.L. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 219-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar, 15Le T.L. Joseph S.R. Yap A.S. Stow J.L. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2002; 283: 489-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The decision to recycle cadherins back to the plasma membrane for engagement in additional rounds of adhesion or to target the cadherin for degradation appears to be coordinated with cellular pathways that modulate tumorigenic transformation, such as Src activation (16Palacios F. Tushir J.S. Fujita Y. D'Souza-Schorey C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 389-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). In the case of both E-cadherin and VE-cadherin, the armadillo family protein p120-catenin appears to play a key role in cadherin membrane trafficking (11Kowalczyk A.P. Reynolds A.B. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2004; 16: 522-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 17Vincent P.A. Xiao K. Buckley K.M. Kowalczyk A.P. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2004; 286: 987-997Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 18Reynolds A.B. Carnahan R.H. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2004; 15: 657-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Specifically, the loss of p120 leads to cadherin endocytosis and degradation in the lysosome, revealing a key role for p120 in modulating the presentation of classical cadherins at the plasma membrane and in the modulation of cadherin expression levels (19Xiao K. Allison D.F. Buckley K.M. Kottke M.D. Vincent P.A. Faundez V. Kowalczyk A.P. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 163: 535-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar, 20Davis M.A. Ireton R.C. Reynolds A.B. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 163: 525-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar). Nonetheless, it is currently unclear how changes in cadherin membrane trafficking are integrated into the pathophysiology of various epithelial tissues and how the balance between junction assembly and turnover is modulated during disease. Furthermore, virtually nothing is known about the cellular pathways that regulate cell surface presentation of the desmosomal cadherins. Because of the severe consequences of genetic or acquired disorders of the desmosome, it is important to understand how desmosomal cadherin membrane trafficking might be altered during disease states characterized by the loss of cell-cell adhesion and tissue fragility. Pemphigus vulgaris (PV) 4The abbreviations used are: PV, pemphigus vulgaris; Dsg3, desmoglein-3; NHK, normal human keratinocytes; KGM, keratinocyte growth medium; NH, normal human; PBS+, phosphate-buffered saline containing Ca2+ Mg2+; PIPES, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid; NHS, normal human serum. is an autoimmune disease characterized by the loss of adhesion (acantholysis) between epithelial cells in the oral mucosa (4Payne A.S. Hanakawa Y. Amagai M. Stanley J.R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2004; 16: 536-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 10Anhalt G.J. Diaz L.A. J. Am. Acad. Dermatol. 2004; 51: S20-S21Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). A series of studies has demonstrated that antibodies directed against the desmosomal cadherin desmoglein-3 (Dsg3) are both necessary and sufficient to cause blistering characteristic of PV patients (21Stanley J.R. Nishikawa T. Diaz L.A. Amagai M. J. Investig. Dermatol. 2001; 116: 489-490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Dsg3-specific IgG purified from patient sera has been shown to cause acantholysis when injected into mice (22Amagai M. Karpati S. Prussick R. Klaus-Kovtun V. Stanley J.R. J. Clin. Investig. 1992; 90: 919-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). Likewise, recombinant Dsg3 can be used to deplete patient sera of disease-causing antibodies, demonstrating that autoantibodies directed against Dsg3 are the cause of blistering and oral erosions observed in PV patients (23Amagai M. Hashimoto T. Shimizu N. Nishikawa T. J. Clin. Investig. 1994; 94: 59-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). Structural studies of classical cadherins (E- and N-cadherin) indicate that the amino-terminal domain of the cadherins form trans dimers with cadherins from adjacent cells (24Koch A.W. Manzur K.L. Shan W. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2004; 61: 1884-1895Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Interestingly, pemphigus IgGs typically recognize the amino-terminal domain of the desmogleins, suggesting that pemphigus autoantibodies may target the adhesive interface of the desmosomal cadherins (22Amagai M. Karpati S. Prussick R. Klaus-Kovtun V. Stanley J.R. J. Clin. Investig. 1992; 90: 919-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar, 25Amagai M. Ishii K. Hashimoto T. Gamou S. Shimizu N. Nishikawa T.

Dermatol. 1995; 105: 147-152Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). This possibility is supported further by the experimental generation of Dsg3 antibodies in pemphigus model mice by adoptive transfer of Dsg3-/- lymphocytes (27Tsunoda K. Ota T. Aoki M. Yamada T. Nagai T. Nakagawa T. Koyasu S. Nishikawa T. Amagai M. J. Immunol. 2003; 170: 2170-2178Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). Antibodies generated by these mice were found to cause PV-like blistering. Furthermore, one antibody, AK23, which was isolated from PV model mice, was able to induce the PV phenotype and recognized sequences likely to be involved in the formation of the adhesive interface of Dsg3. These and numerous other studies provide strong evidence that PV IgG targets Dsg3 and causes blistering by disrupting adhesive interactions dependent upon Dsg3 function (4Payne A.S. Hanakawa Y. Amagai M. Stanley J.R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2004; 16: 536-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Interestingly, several studies have suggested that PV autoantibodies are internalized from the cell surface and that endocytosis of the antibodies may be important in PV pathogenesis (28Iwatsuki K. Takigawa M. Imaizumi S. Yamada M. J. Am. Acad. Dermatol. 1989; 20: 578-582Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 29Iwatsuki K. Han G.W. Fukuti R. Ohtsuka M. Kikuchi S. Akiba H.

Recent advances in membrane trafficking pathways have resulted in the identification of molecular markers for specific endocytic compartments (33Robinson M.S. Trends Cell Biol. 2004; 14: 167-174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar, 34Gruenberg J. Stenmark H. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 5: 317-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar), there by providing a means to define the fate of PV IgG and desmosomal proteins after ligation of Dsg3 at the cell surface. To begin an investigation of the cellular and molecular pathways modulated upon PV IgG binding to Dsg3, primary cultures of human keratinocytes were used to investigate the effects of PV IgG on desmosome structure and keratinocyte adhesion. Our results suggest that PV autoantibodies trigger two major events after ligation of Dsg3 at the cell surface. First, PV IgG cause the disassembly of desmosomes at or near the cell surface and the retraction of keratin filaments from lateral cell-cell borders. Secondly, PV IgG trigger the co-endocytosis of Dsg3 and plakoglobin, leading to delivery of Dsg3 to lysosomal compartments and a dramatic decrease in Dsg3 protein levels. These findings suggest a coordinated cellular response to PV IgG in which Dsg3 endocytosis, the disassembly of the desmosomal plaque, and keratin filament retraction from the cell surface are mechanistically coupled to the loss of keratinocyte adhesion in response to pemphigus patient antibodies. Cells and Culture Conditions—Normal human keratinocytes (NHKs) isolated from neonatal foreskin (Emory Skin Disease Research Center) were cultured in keratinocyte growth medium (KGM, Cambrex Corp., East Rutherford, NJ). Before experimentation, keratinocytes at passage 3 or 4 were seeded into tissue culture dishes, and calcium was switched to KGM medium containing 0.5 mm calcium 16-18 h before treatments and remained in this medium for the remainder of experimentation. Immunofluorescence—NHKs cultured on glass coverslips were switched to KGM containing 0.5 mm calcium 16-18 h before treatment with either normal human serum (Irvine Scientific, Santa Ana, CA), sera from PV patients, or affinity-purified IgG from either normal human (NH) or PV patient sera. Under the culture conditions used throughout this study, the keratinocytes express predominantly Dsg3 and detectable but low levels of Dsg1. For our studies, sera from three different PV patients were tested and found to have similar effects. No differences were noted between IgG derived from patients with mucosal PV with autoantibodies against Dsg3 versus patients with mucocutaneous PV harboring autoantibodies against both Dsg3 and Dsg1. For most experiments IgG was allowed to bind to cells by incubating cultures on ice for 30 min to 1 h at a concentration of 1 mg/ml with serum diluted in KGM containing 0.5 mm calcium and then returned to 37 °C for indicated times. Cells were fixed on ice using either -20 °C methanol for 5 min or 3.7% paraformaldehyde for 10 min followed by extraction in 0.5% Triton X-100 for 7 min. For monitoring cell surface desmoglein 3, cells were fixed on ice for 10 min in 3.7% paraformaldehyde. The localization of desmosomal and adherens junction components were monitored using the following antibodies: mouse anti-desmoglein 3, AK15 (27Tsunoda K. Ota T. Aoki M. Yamada T. Nagai T. Nakagawa T. Koyasu S. Nishikawa T. Amagai M. J. Immunol. 2003; 170: 2170-2178Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar), mouse anti-desmoplakin 1 and 2 (Transduction Laboratories, San Diego, CA), mouse anti-plakoglobin (Transduction Laboratories), or mouse anti-β-catenin (Transduction Laboratories). Cytokeratin was detected using a mouse anti-cytokeratin antibody (Immunotech, Marseille, France). Either a polyclonal antibody against cathepsin D (Upstate, Lake Placid, NY) or a monoclonal antibody H5C6 directed against CD63 (Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank at the University of Iowa) was used to detect late endosomes/lysosomes. The localization of early endosomes was monitored using a mouse monoclonal EEA-1 antibody (Transduction Laboratories) or a rabbit polyclonal EEA-1 antibody (Affinity Bioreagents, Golden, CO). Appropriate species cross-absorbed secondary antibodies conjugated to various Alexa Fluors (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) were used for dual-label immunofluorescence. A Leica DMR-E fluorescence microscope equipped with narrow band-pass filters and a Hamamatsu Orca camera was used for image acquisition. Images were captured and processed using either Open Lab software (Improvision, Inc., Lexington, MA) or Simple PCI (Compix, Inc., Cranberry Township, PA). Immunoelectron Microscopy—NHKs were prepared as above and treated with either normal human serum or pemphigus serum. Cells were fixed for 30 min at room temperature in 4% paraformaldehyde with 0.1% glutaraldehyde followed by overnight fixation of 2% paraformaldehyde at 4 °C. Cells were then permeabilized with 0.05% Triton X-100 for 15 min followed by a 30-min block in goat serum. Human IgG were monitored by incubating cells with goat anti-human 5-nm gold-conjugated secondary antibodies (Aurion, Wageningen, The Netherlands) followed by silver enhancement. Samples were then processed for conventional electron microscopy. Dispase-based Dissociation Assay—A dispase dissociation assay was performed as described previously (35Huen A.C. Park J.K. Godsel L.M. Chen X. Bannon L.J. Amargo E.V. Hudson T.Y. Mongiu A.K. Leigh I.M. Kelsell D.P. Gumbiner B.M. Green K.J. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 159: 1005-1017Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Briefly, NHK cultures were seeded in triplicate onto 35-mm dishes and allowed to grow to confluence. 24 h after reaching confluency, cultures were then switched to 0.5 mm calcium containing KGM for 18 h. The cells were treated with normal human serum or PV serum diluted 1:4 in KGM media containing 0.5 mm calcium and incubated on ice for 30 min to 1 h. Cells were then supplemented with additional KGM media containing 0.5 mm calcium and incubated at 37 °C for various amounts of time. After incubation, cells were washed three times in PBS+ and then incubated in 1 unit/ml dispase in PBS+ (Roche Diagnostics) for more than 30 min. Released monolayers were subjected to mechanical stress by transferring the cell sheets to 15-ml conical tubes containing 11 ml final volume of PBS+. The tubes were subjected to 50 inversion cycles on a rocker panel. Fragments were counted using a dissecting microscope. Internalization Assay—IgG internalization was performed as previously described (19Xiao K. Allison D.F. Buckley K.M. Kottke M.D. Vincent P.A. Faundez V. Kowalczyk A.P. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 163: 535-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). NHKs were cultured on glass coverslips for experimentation. 1 mg/ml concentrations of either NH IgG or PV IgG was incubated with cells at 4 °C on ice for 30 min in KGM media containing a final concentration of 0.5 mm calcium. Cells were then washed 3 times with PBS+ followed by incubation at 37 °C for 0-6 h in 0.5 mm calcium containing KGM media. The cells were rinsed, fixed, and processed for dual label immunofluorescence as described above. For the 24-h time points, the cells were prepared identically as the 6-h incubation with the exception that the PV IgG and NH IgG were not removed after incubation on ice. Cell Surface Biotinylation—NHKs were grown to 70% confluency in 60-mm dishes in KGM media. 18 h before biotinylation the cell culture media was changed to that of media containing 0.5 mm calcium. Cultures were washed three times in cold PBS+ and labeled with EZ-Link Sulfo NHS-SS-Biotin (Pierce) at 1 mg/ml in PBS+ on ice for 1 h. Excess biotin was quenched with 3 washes on ice for 5 min each in PBS+ containing 50 mm ammonium chloride and followed by 4 washes in cold PBS+. Cells were treated with either NH or PV IgG at a final concentration 1 mg/ml in KGM media containing 0.5 mm calcium on ice for 1 h followed by incubation at 37 °C for the indicated times. Samples were lysed using Cytoskeleton buffer (50 mm NaCl, 10 mm PIPES, 3 mm MgCl2, 300 mm sucrose, 1% Triton X-100, 10 mm NaF, 10 mm NaP2O7, pH 6.8) containing protease inhibitor mixture. After centrifugation at 14,000 × g, the supernatant was recovered and incubated with Ultra-Link immobilized streptavidin (Pierce) for 2 h at 4 °C. Cell surface biotin-labeled proteins were captured by centrifugation, and the beads were washed four times in Cytoskeleton lysis buffer. Biotin-labeled proteins were released in 2× Laemmli buffer containing β-mercaptoethanol at 95 °C and then resolved by 7.5% SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose according to standard protocols. The membranes were analyzed for both desmoglein 3 and E-cadherin using either an anti- Dsg3 mixture containing monoclonal antibodies AK15 and anti-Dsg3 (Zymed Laboratories Inc., South San Francisco, CA) or mouse anti-E-cadherin (BD Biosciences). Sequential Detergent Extraction and Western Blot Analysis—Sequential detergent extraction was performed as described (36Palka H.L. Green K.J. J. Cell Science. 1997; 110: 2359-2371Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with the following exceptions. Cells were grown on 60-mm plates and extracted for 10 min on iced Triton buffer (1% Triton X-100, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 140 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 2 mm EGTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A). Cells were scraped using a rubber policeman, vortexed for 30 s, and centrifuged at ∼14,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. After centrifugation, the Triton-soluble pool was transferred to a fresh tube. The Triton-insoluble proteins were solubilized in SDS-urea buffer (1% SDS, 8 m urea, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 140 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 2 mm EGTA). The samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblot analysis using chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham Biosciences). PV IgG Disrupt Desmosomes and Compromise Keratinocyte Adhesive Strength in Vitro—The role of Dsg3 autoantibodies in the pathogenesis of PV has been well established, but the precise mechanism by which these antibodies disrupt adhesion and lead to acantholysis in vivo remains unclear. To investigate the mechanism by which Dsg3 antibodies cause acantholysis, we sought to establish an in vitro system to model the disease and to determine how keratinocytes respond to pathogenic antibodies. The effect of PV IgG on desmosome assembly in primary human keratinocytes was evaluated by immunofluorescence microscopy. Cells exposed to purified NH IgG for 24 h exhibited well developed desmosomes with extensive desmoplakin staining at cell-cell contacts (Fig. 1, A and B). IgG binding to the cell layer was detected in some cells, but no junctional localization of the IgG was detected. In contrast, keratinocytes exposed to IgG from PV patients for 24 h exhibited dramatic alterations in desmoplakin organization (Fig. 1, C and D). In control cells punctate desmoplakin staining was prominent at cell borders throughout the keratinocyte culture. However, junctional desmoplakin staining was discontinuous, and desmoplakin was found redistributed to interior regions of the cytoplasm in keratinocytes exposed to PV IgG (Fig. 1D). The alterations in desmoplakin localization were associated with keratin filament retraction from the cell surface in keratinocytes treated with PV IgG. In control keratinocytes treated with NH IgG, keratin filaments extended to the cell periphery and were clearly visible at cell-cell boundaries (Fig. 1, E, F, and G). In contrast, keratin filaments were retracted from cell-cell junctions in keratinocytes exposed to PV IgG for 24 h (Fig. 1, H, I, and J). DIC imaging indicated that although the cells exposed to PV IgG exhibited disrupted desmosomes, the cells remained in close proximity. Similarly, E-cadherin distribution was largely unchanged in keratinocytes exposed to PV IgG for 24 h (not shown). The effects of PV IgG on desmosomes were further characterized by pre-embedding immunoelectron microscopy and by functional assays to assess keratinocyte adhesive strength. PV IgG bound to desmosomes and the cell surface of keratinocytes incubated at 4 °C (Fig. 2, A and B). Desmosomes were prominent, and keratin filaments extended to the cell periphery and were visible at virtually every desmosomal junction. However, in keratinocytes incubated at 37 °C for 6 h in the presence of PV IgG, desmosomes were disrupted, and keratin filaments were retracted from the plasma membrane (Fig. 2, C, D, and E). Vesicular structures containing immunogold-labeled IgG were routinely observed (Fig. 2, D and E). Interestingly, PV IgG internalized into these cytoplasmic vesicles did not appear to colocalize with internalized desmosomes or half-desmosomes. In addition, PV IgG that remained at the cell surface was often associated with desmosomes that appeared to be splitting and partially disassembled (Fig. 2F, arrow). Control keratinocytes exposed to NHS for 6 h at 37 °C exhibited extensive desmosomes that were often associated with keratin filament bundles (Fig. 2, G and H). These results indicate that PV IgG specifically disrupt desmosomes and cause keratin filament retraction from cell-cell borders. To determine whether the disruption of desmosomes in response to PV IgG resulted in a reduction in keratinocyte cell-cell adhesive strength, a dispase-based assay was used to assess the strength of cell-cell adhesion (35Huen A.C. Park J.K. Godsel L.M. Chen X. Bannon L.J. Amargo E.V. Hudson T.Y. Mongiu A.K. Leigh I.M. Kelsell D.P. Gumbiner B.M. Green K.J. J.

Dermatol. 2000; 115: 332Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Dispase disrupts cell-matrix interactions but not cell-cell adhesion. Therefore, keratinocytes were released from the substrate using dispase and then placed in conical tubes and rotated to expose the keratinocyte cell layer to mechanical stress. Under these conditions keratinocytes incubated with normal human sera remained as an intact sheet of cells. In contrast, keratinocytes exposed to PV sera dispersed into numerous multicellular aggregates (Fig. 2I). Identical results were obtained with purified IgG fractions from multiple patients (not shown). These results demonstrate that PV IgG causes changes in desmoplakin and keratin organization and disrupt desmosome morphology, as assessed by electron microscopy. These changes are associated with a dramatic reduction in the strength of keratinocyte cell-cell adhesion. The mechanism by which pemphigus IgG disrupts desmosomes may involve steric hindrance of desmoglein adhesive interactions. However, several studies have suggested that keratinocyte responses are required after IgG ligation of desmogleins in order for pemphigus IgG to disrupt adhesion (38Kitajima Y. Clin. Exp. Dermatol. 2002; 27: 684-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 39Waschke J. Bruggeman P. Baumgartner W. Zillikens D. Drenckhahn D. J. Clin. Investig. 2005; 115: 3157-3165Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). The latter possibility predicts that incubation of keratinocytes with PV IgG at low temperature should prevent the disruption of adhesion and that the loss of adhesion would occur over time for cells incubated at 37 °C. Therefore, keratinocytes were incubated with PV IgG or normal human IgG for 1 h at 4 °C.Under these conditions, PV IgG bound to keratinocyte cell surfaces and decorated Dsg3 located on the cell surface and at cell-cell borders (Fig. 3E). Desmoplakin remained localized at the cell-cell borders (Fig. 3A) and appeared indistinguishable from desmoplakin in control cells incubated with NH IgG (not shown). Note that these same conditions were also used for the immunoelectron microscopy studies shown in Fig. 2, A and B. Furthermore, in cells incubated on ice, PV IgG caused no change in keratinocyte adhesive strength relative to control cells incubated in NH IgG under the same conditions (Fig. 3I). These data indicate that desmosomes are not disrupted by PV IgG binding to cell surface Dsg3 if cells are metabolically unable to respond. In contrast, incubation at 37 °C led to substantial alterations in desmoplakin localization (Fig. 3, A-D) that correlated with a loss of adhesive strength over time (Fig. 3I). However, these ch"
https://openalex.org/W1993720756,"The p53 tumor suppressor is activated in the cellular response to genotoxic stress. Transactivation of p53 target genes dictates cell cycle arrest and DNA repair or induction of apoptosis; however, a molecular mechanism responsible for these distinct functions remains unclear. Recent studies revealed that phosphorylation of p53 on Ser46 was associated with induction of p53AIP1 expression, resulting in the commitment of the cell fate into apoptotic cell death. Moreover, upon exposure to genotoxic stress, p53DINP1 was expressed and recruited a kinase(s) to p53 that specifically phosphorylated Ser46. Here, we show that the pro-apoptotic kinase, protein kinase C δ (PKCδ), is involved in phosphorylation of p53 on Ser46. PKCδ-mediated phosphorylation is required for the interaction of PKCδ with p53. The results also demonstrate that p53DINP1 associates with PKCδ upon exposure to genotoxic agents. Consistent with these results, PKCδ potentiates p53-dependent apoptosis by Ser46 phosphorylation in response to genotoxic stress. These findings indicate that PKCδ regulates p53 to induce apoptotic cell death in the cellular response to DNA damage."
https://openalex.org/W2005289326,"Engagement of death receptors such as tumor necrosis factor-R1 and Fas brings about the cleavage of cytosolic Bid to truncated Bid (tBid), which translocates to mitochondria to activate Bax/Bak, resulting in the release of cytochrome c. The mechanism underlying the activation, however, is not fully understood. Here, we have identified the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family member Mcl-1 as a potent tBid-binding partner. Site-directed mutagenesis reveals that the Bcl-2 homology (BH)3 domain of tBid is essential for binding to Mcl-1, whereas all three BH domains (BH1, BH2, and BH3) of Mcl-1 are required for interaction with tBid. In vitro studies using isolated mitochondria and recombinant proteins demonstrate that Mcl-1 strongly inhibits tBid-induced cytochrome c release. In addition to its ability to interact directly with Bax and Bak, tBid also binds Mcl-1 and displaces Bak from the Mcl-1-Bak complex. Importantly, overexpression of Mcl-1 confers resistance to the induction of apoptosis by both TRAIL and tumor necrosis factor-α in HeLa cells, whereas targeting Mcl-1 by RNA interference sensitizes HeLa cells to TRAIL-induced apoptosis.

The commitment of cells to apoptosis in response to diverse physiological cues and cytotoxic agents is primarily regulated by proteins of the Bcl-2 family that are evolutionarily conserved from nematodes to humans (1Gross A.

The anti-apoptotic members include Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, A1, Bcl-w, and Mcl-1. The pro-apoptotic family members are further divided according to whether they contain multiple BH domains (such as Bax and Bak) or only the BH3 domain (such as Bid and Bim). The BH3 domain-only proteins require cooperation of other multidomain family members to induce apoptosis (3Desagher S. Osen-Sand A. Nichols A. Eskes R. Montessuit S. Lauper S. Maundrell K.

Biochem. 2000; 69: 217-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (1366) Google Scholar). In the extrinsic pathway, apoptosis is initiated through ligand binding to cell surface receptors of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) family such as TNF-R1 and Fas. Upon ligation these receptors initiate the formation of a death-inducing signaling complex, which consists of adaptor molecules such as the Fas-associated death domain protein and procaspase-8. Within the complex, caspase-8 undergoes autoproteolytic activation. Once activated, caspase-8 can activate downstream caspases, for example, caspase-3 and -7, leading to orderly degradation of intracellular substrates and cell death. The cell-intrinsic pathway is initiated when the integrity of the outer mitochondrial membrane is lost in response to diverse apoptotic stimuli. This results in the release of cytochrome c and other apoptotic proteins into the cytoplasm, where cytochrome c binds to apoptotic protease-activating factor 1 (Apaf-1). Apaf-1 in turn recruits procaspase-9 to form a multimeric complex, which leads to the autoproteolytic activation of caspase-9. The active caspase-9 then efficiently activates other downstream caspases, bringing about the morphological changes characteristic of apoptosis. This intrinsic pathway is thus mitochondria-dependent and tightly controlled by the Bcl-2 family proteins.Although the two apoptotic pathways can function independently, an existing link between them is the BH3 domain-only protein Bid that is cleaved by active caspase-8 following engagement of death receptor Fas (10Li H.

Cell. 1998; 94: 481-490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3061) Google Scholar). Cleaved Bid, also known as truncated Bid (tBid), translocates to mitochondria to induce oligomerization of Bax and/or Bak and cytochrome c release (4Wei M.C. Lindsten T. Mootha V.K. Weiler S.

Biol. 2000; 20: 929-935Crossref PubMed Scopus (1011) Google Scholar). In both Bax-/- and Bak-/- cells, tBid fails to induce cytochrome c release and apoptosis, suggesting that it requires Bax and/or Bak to exert its mitochondrial pro-apoptotic activity (5Wei M.C. Zong W.-X. Cheng E.H.-Y. Lindsten T. Panoutsakopoulou V. Ross A.J. Roth K.A. MacGregor G.R. Thompson C.B. Korsmeyer S.J. Science. 2001; 292: 727-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (3317) Google Scholar). However, the underlying mechanism and, in particular, the sequence of events that occurs after Bid cleavage and prior to cytochrome c release are not completely defined. In this study we investigated the mechanism of tBid-induced activation of the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway by searching for novel tBid-interacting proteins using a yeast two-hybrid screen. We identified the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family protein Mcl-1 as a genuine tBid-binding partner. Further studies demonstrate that Mcl-1 effectively inhibits tBid-induced cytochrome c release from mitochondria and protects HeLa cells from apoptosis induced by both tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) and TNF-α.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials and Cell Culture—All media and cell culture reagents were purchased from Invitrogen. Other chemicals, unless otherwise stated, were obtained from Sigma. Human cervical carcinoma HeLa cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD) and cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm glutamine, 0.5 units/ml penicillin, and 0.5 mg/ml streptomycin.Cloning of cDNAs and Plasmids Construction—Mouse tBid cDNA was amplified by PCR from a murine pcDNA3-Bid template (a gift from Dr. S. Korsmeyer, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA) and inserted into EcoRI-BamHI sites downstream of the GAL4-DBD in the vector pGBKT7 (Clontech). A cDNA encoding mouse Baxα lacking the C-terminal hydrophobic domain (Baxα21) was amplified by PCR from a pcDNA3-Baxα template (13Brady H.J. Salomons G.S. Bobeldijk R.C. Berns A.J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1221-1230Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) and cloned downstream of the GAL4-AD in pGADT7 vector (Clontech). A pUC18-bcl-2 construct (Clonexpress, Gaithersburg, MD) was used to clone the human Bcl-2 cDNA. This construct was digested with EcoRI and HindIII to release the Bcl-2 cDNA, which was then ligated into the corresponding sites in pcDNA3.1/myc-HIS©(-) (Invitrogen). Human Bid and tBid cDNA were generated by reverse transcriptase PCR using oligo(dT) primer with total RNA obtained from human leukemic Jurkat T cells. Both cDNAs were then cloned at the EcoRI-BamHI sites downstream of the HA-tag in pcDNA3.1-HA (Invitrogen) (14Clohessy J.G. Zhuang J. Brady H.J.M. Br. J. Haematol. 2004; 125: 655-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The construct expressing HA-tagged human Mcl-1 was generated as previously described (14Clohessy J.G. Zhuang J. Brady H.J.M. Br. J. Haematol. 2004; 125: 655-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). GST fusion protein constructs were generated by PCR using pcDNA3.1-HA-Bid and -tBid as templates and cloned into the EcoRI-XhoI sites in the pGEX-6P-2 vector (Amersham Biosciences). Mutations in the BH domains of tBid and Mcl-1 proteins were generated by site-directed mutagenesis using the GeneTailor™ site-directed mutagenesis system according to manufacturer’s instruction (Invitrogen). The G94E mutation of BH3 domain of tBid was generated by PCR using the pGEX-tBid construct as a template. Using pcDNA3.1-HA-Mcl-1 as a template for PCR of all Mcl-1 mutants, we generated the G262E mutation at BH1 domain, the W305A and W312A double mutations for BH2 domain, and the G217E and D218A double mutations of BH3 domain of Mcl-1. The cDNA fragment encoding human Mcl-1 generated by PCR was inserted into the NdeI and SapI sites of the pTYB1 vector for the expression of recombinant human Mcl-1 protein (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA). The accuracy of the molecular identity of all constructs was confirmed by sequencing. For details of the PCR primers used see the supplemental data.Yeast Two-hybrid Assay—All yeast two-hybrid procedures were carried out according to the manufacturer’s protocol (Clontech). The cDNA for mouse-truncated Bid was cloned into the pGBKT7 vector as described earlier. The cDNA library was generated from mouse primary thymocytes that had been treated with 5 gray of γ-irradiation and cultured for 5 h to induce apoptosis. The RNA was then isolated from these cells, and the cDNA library was prepared by oligo(dT) priming and directionally cloned in the EcoRI-XhoI sites of the prey vector pAD-Gal4-2.1 (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The library was amplified once and found to have over 90% recombinants with an average insert size of 1.5 Kb. Screening was carried out by sequential transformation of the tBid construct followed by the cDNA library into yeast strain Y190. After transformation, the yeast were grown for 15 days on selection plates containing 17 mm 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole. Colonies that grew on the plates were tested for activity of the β-galactosidase reporter gene by filter-lift assay. Plasmids from the positive colonies were isolated and subjected to PCR and sequencing to identify the prey cDNAs. The specificity of the interaction was confirmed by retransformation.GST Fusion Protein Production and Binding Assay—GST fusion proteins were produced in BL21 Escherichia coli following the induction of expression by isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (Insight Biotechnology, Middlesex, UK) and purified using glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences). In vitro translated proteins labeled with [35S]methionine were prepared using the TnT® T7 Quick-Coupled Transcription/Translation System (Promega, Madison, WI), using pcDNA3.1-HA constructs as templates. The 35S-labeled prey proteins were incubated with GST, GST-Bid, or GST-tBid fusion proteins bound to glutathione-Sepharose beads in bead-binding buffer (50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.5, 150 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100) and protease inhibitors mixture from Roche Applied Science. The mixtures were incubated at 4 °C for 2 h with rotation. The beads were then pelleted and washed five times in ice-cold bead-binding buffer. Finally, beads were resuspended in SDS sample buffer, and the proteins were resolved on SDS-polyacrylamide gels, which were fixed, vacuum-dried onto 3MM paper, and then visualized using a PhosphorImager (Typhoon 8600, Amersham Biosciences).Immunoprecipitation—For each immunoprecipitation experiment, HeLa cells were transfected with HA-tBid in pcDNA3.1 or empty vector in the presence of 75 μm Z-VAD-fmk (Enzyme System, Dublin, CA). Immunoprecipitation was essentially carried out as described (15Perez D. White E. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 53-63Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Briefly, 24 h after transfection, cells were harvested and resuspended in ice-cold lysis buffer containing 2% CHAPS, 20 mm Tris/HCl (pH 7.4), 137 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, and protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). Lysates were precleared and then incubated with either mouse anti-HA monoclonal antibody (clone 12CA5, Roche) or rabbit anti-Mcl-1 polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) at 4 °C for 1 h, and protein A-Sepharose beads (Pharmacia, Piscataway, NJ) were added to pull down the immunocomplexes. The beads were washed five times in washing buffer containing 0.2% Triton X-100, 20 mm Tris/HCl (pH 7.4), 137 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol before being resuspended in SDS sample buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE. Immunoblotting was performed using, where appropriate, goat anti-Bid polyclonal antibody (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN), rabbit anti-Mcl-1 polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz), rabbit anti-Bcl-2 polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz), mouse anti-Mcl-1 monoclonal antibody (Chemicon International, Temecula, CA), rabbit anti-Bak (NT) polyclonal antibody (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY), or rabbit anti-Bax (NT) polyclonal antibody (Upstate). For quantification of Bak and Mcl-1 levels, bands representing respective Bak and Mcl-1 from membranes of three independent immunoprecipitation experiments were scanned and analyzed using a GS-800 Calibrated Densitometer with Quantity One software (Bio-Rad).Immunoblotting—SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting were performed essentially as described (16Zhuang J. Ren Y. Snowden R.T. Zhu H. Gogvadze V. Savill J.S. Cohen G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15628-15632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Briefly, cellular proteins were resolved on the polyacrylamide gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham Biosciences). The membranes were probed with, where appropriate, goat anti-Bid polyclonal antibody, rabbit anti-Mcl-1 polyclonal antibody, mouse anti-cytochrome c monoclonal antibody (clone 7H8.2C12, Pharmingen), mouse anti-cytochrome oxidase subunit II monoclonal antibody (clone 12C4-F12, Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR), mouse anti-PARP monoclonal antibody (clone C2-10, R&D Systems), or rat anti-α-tubulin monoclonal antibody (Serotec, Oxford, UK). After incubating with respective secondary antibodies conjugated with horseradish peroxidase, the membranes were visualized by ECL Kit (Amersham Biosciences).In Vitro Assay for Mitochondrial Cytochrome c Release—This assay was performed as described (17Nijhawan D. Fang M. Traer E. Zhong Q. Gao W. Du F. Wang X. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 1475-1486Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar) with minimum modification. In brief, 20 × 106 HeLa cells were harvested and washed once in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. The cell pellet was resuspended in 5× volume of buffer A (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 250 mm sucrose, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and protease inhibitor mixture from Roche Applied Science) and incubated on ice for 15 min. Cells were then disrupted by passing them through a 23-gauge needle 25 times before undergoing centrifugation in two sequential steps: 1000 × g and 10,000 × g. The 10,000 × g pellet was collected as mitochondrial fraction and resuspended at a 5 μg/μl concentration in buffer A supplemented with 150 mm NaCl. Resuspended mitochondria were incubated either alone or with caspase-8-cleaved recombinant human Bid (R&D Systems) at indicated concentrations at 37 °C for 15 min. Following incubation, the mitochondria were centrifuged, with the resulting supernatant collected for examination of cytochrome c release by immunoblotting and the pellet was cross-examined for loss of cytochrome c and cytochrome oxidase subunit II as sample loading control.Preparation of Recombinant Human Mcl-1—The cDNAs of full-length human Mcl-1 and mutant Mcl-1mtBH3 were cloned into pTYB1 vector (New England Biolabs), which were used to transform BL21 cells, respectively. The recombinant proteins were induced with the addition of isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and purified according to manufacturer’s instruction (New England Biolabs). The proteins were further concentrated using centrifugal filter devices (Amicon Ultra-4 30,000 MWCO) (Millipore, Bedford, MA).Generation of Stably Transfected Cell Lines and Induction of Apoptosis—HeLa cells were split to 40-50% confluence in 10-cm dishes the day prior to transfection and transfected with 10 μg of pcDNA3.1-HA or pcDNA3.1-HA-Mcl-1 using Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen), according to the manufacturer’s instructions. 24 h after transfection cells were split and cultured under selection with 1 mg/ml G418 (Invitrogen). Single cell clones were picked and expanded to establish the stable Mcl-1 overexpressing cells. Overexpression of the Mcl-1 protein was confirmed by immunoblotting. To induce apoptosis, wild type, vector-only, and HA-Mcl-1 overexpressing stable HeLa cells were all treated with soluble recombinant human TRAIL (Alexis Biochemicals, San Diego, CA) at indicated concentrations for 14 h. Cells were also treated with TNF-α (15 ng/ml) in the presence of cycloheximide (30 μg/ml) for 22 h. Apoptosis was assessed by flow cytometry for cells with sub-G1 DNA content following propidium iodide staining and PARP cleavage as previous described (16Zhuang J. Ren Y. Snowden R.T. Zhu H. Gogvadze V. Savill J.S. Cohen G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15628-15632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar).Lentivirus Generation and Expression of Mcl-1 Short Hairpin RNA—A BLOCK-iT Lentiviral RNAi Expression System (Invitrogen) was used according to manufacturer’s instruction. Briefly, the RNA interference sequence for human Mcl-1, GGACTGGCTAGTTAAACAAAG, was identified using manufacturer’s RNAi Designer program, and the corresponding oligonucleotides were cloned into pENTR™/U6 vector (Invitrogen). The RNA interference sequence for mouse eleven-nineteen leukemia (ENL) gene, GCTGTGAGAAGCTCACCTTCA, was used to produce control short hairpin RNA (shRNA), and its oligonucleotides were also cloned into the vector. DH5α E. coli (Invitrogen) were transformed, and clones were verified by sequencing. The correctly identified clones were transferred via a gateway reaction to a modified pLenti6/BLOCK-iT™-DEST vector (Invitrogen), a promoterless lentiviral destination vector in which the blasticidin resistance marker is replaced with tailless human CD2 as a marker. 293 cells were transfected with the plasmids using Lipofectamine reagent to produce the virus. 48 h later, the lentivirus-containing supernatants were harvested to infect HeLa cells in the presence of Polybrene. The infected HeLa cells were harvested 48 h later for the analysis of Mcl-1 expression by immunoblotting. Induction of apoptosis by TRAIL was performed essentially as described above.RESULTSTruncated Bid Interacts with Mcl-1—We initially performed a yeast two-hybrid screen using truncated Bid as the bait protein and identified a number of tBid-interacting proteins. These included two anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins Mcl-1 and Bcl-2. Only one positive clone representing a cDNA of Bcl-2 was found to interact with tBid, consistent with a previous report that Bid interacted with Bcl-2 (18Wang K. Yin X.M. Chao D.T. Milliman C.L. Korsmeyer S.J. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2859-2869Crossref PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar). There were, however, three independent positive clones identified representing cDNAs encoding Mcl-1, and the in-frame amino acid sequences from each clones were aligned against the full-length murine Mcl-1 (19Okita H. Umezawa A. Suzuki A. Hata J.-i. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1398: 335-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) as shown in Fig. 1A. One positive clone (clone 85) containing the shortest Mcl-1 cDNA lacked the 5′-region encoding for the first 144 amino acids, suggesting that the C terminus fragment of the Mcl-1 protein containing the BH1, BH2, and BH3 domains was responsible for interacting with tBid. To exclude the possibility of false interaction, the plasmids from the positive clones were isolated and retransformed into yeast containing the plasmid of tBid cDNA, and the activity of the β-galactosidase reporter gene was examined using the filter-lift assay. As Bid has also been reported to interact with Bax (18Wang K. Yin X.M. Chao D.T. Milliman C.L. Korsmeyer S.J. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2859-2869Crossref PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar), we used Bax as positive control with the mouse Baxα cDNA cloned in the pGADT7 vector during retransformation. The filter-lift assay detected the β-galactosidase activity in the clone transformed with plasmid containing Bax cDNA in the presence of tBid (Fig. 1B, lower right panel). Interestingly, the clone identified as expressing the Mcl-1 fusion protein showed a much greater intensity of β-galactosidase staining than the clone expressing the Bcl-2 fusion protein (Fig. 1B, compare upper right panel with middle right panel).To see whether the interaction of Mcl-1 with tBid could be confirmed by an independent method, we performed GST fusion protein pulldown experiments. GST-Bid and GST-tBid fusion proteins were immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose beads, respectively, and incubated with either [35S]-methionine labeled Mcl-1 or Bcl-2 (Fig. 2A). This assay identified Mcl-1 as a protein specifically interacting with tBid rather than the full-length Bid (Fig. 2A, compare lane 4 with lane 3, upper panel). Bcl-2 was also seen to preferentially interact with the truncated form of Bid (Fig. 2A, compare lane 4 with lane 3, lower panel). Similar to the result shown in Fig. 1B, tBid fusion protein again showed a higher affinity for Mcl-1 than Bcl-2 (Fig. 2A).FIGURE 2Truncated Bid interacts with Mcl-1 in vitro and in vivo. A, in vitro translated [35S]methionine-labeled Mcl-1 (upper panel) and Bcl-2 (lower panel) were incubated with GST alone, GST-Bid, or GST-tBid immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose beads. Bound proteins were visualized using a PhosphorImager after protein separation by SDS-PAGE. B, HeLa cells were transfected with either pcDNA3.1 vector alone or a HA-tBid construct in the presence of 75 μm Z-VAD-fmk. 24 h after transfection, cells were lysed and subject to immunoprecipitation (IP) using anti-HA antibody (upper panel) or anti-Mcl-1 antibody (lower panel). Precipitated immunocomplexes were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting (IB) using anti-Mcl-1 antibody (upper panel), anti-Bcl-2 antibody (middle panel), or anti-Bid antibody (lower panel).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Next, we carried out co-immunoprecipitation experiments to check whether this interaction occurs within cells. A HA-tagged tBid construct was generated and subsequently used to overexpress tBid in HeLa cells in the presence of the pan caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-fmk to delay cell death. Cells were lysed 24 h after transfection, and immunoprecipitation was done using an anti-HA antibody. The endogenous Mcl-1 was detected in complex with HA-tBid by immunoblotting (Fig. 2B, upper panel). In addition, endogenous Bcl-2 was also detected in complex with HA-tBid (Fig. 2B, middle panel), in agreement with an early report (18Wang K. Yin X.M. Chao D.T. Milliman C.L. Korsmeyer S.J. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2859-2869Crossref PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar). Similarly, when an anti-Mcl-1 antibody was used to immunoprecipitate Mcl-1 complex from lysates of cells overexpressing HA-tBid, tBid was clearly observed to interact with Mcl-1 (Fig. 2B, lower panel). It is important to mention that the endogenous full-length Bid was not immunoprecipitated by the anti-Mcl-1 antibody under the experimental conditions used (data not shown), further underlining the specificity of the interaction between Mcl-1 and the truncated form of the Bid protein.BH3 Domain of tBid and All Three BH Domains of Mcl-1 Are Required for Interaction—We then investigated the binding sites responsible for the interaction between tBid and Mcl-1. Based on previous reports describing the amino acids critical for interactions between Bcl-2 family proteins (18Wang K. Yin X.M. Chao D.T. Milliman C.L. Korsmeyer S.J. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2859-2869Crossref PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar, 20Cheng E.H.-Y. Levine B. Boise L.H. Thompson C.B. Hardwick J.M.

To test this hypothesis we generated a number of constructs that contained cDNAs encoding for Mcl-1 and tBid but with their BH domains mutated. First, we compared the abilities of GST-tBid with mutant GST-tBid (mtBH3) (containing G94E mutation at BH3 domain) to interact with [35S]methionine-labeled Mcl-1. GST-tBid, but not mutant GST-tBid (mtBH3), was shown to interact with Mcl-1 (Fig. 3A, compare lane 3 with lane 4). This indicated that the BH3 domain of tBid was required for interaction with Mcl-1. Next, we compared the binding ability of wild type Mcl-1 to GST-tBid with that of Mcl-1 proteins that had mutations at BH1 (G262E mutation), BH2 (W305A and W312A double mutations), or BH3 (G217E and D218A double mutations) domain, respectively. As shown in Fig. 3B, apart from wild type Mcl-1, all three Mcl-1 proteins with their respective BH domain mutated failed to interact with GST-tBid. Mutations in BH1 and BH3 domains resulted in a complete loss of interaction, whereas mutations in BH2 domains severely impaired the binding ability of Mcl-1 to GST-tBid. These results demonstrated that all three BH domains of Mcl-1 contribute to its ability to interact with tBid.FIGURE 3BH domains of both tBid and Mcl-1 are required for interaction. A, requirement of BH3 domain of tBid to bind Mcl-1. In vitro translated [35S]methionine-labeled Mcl-1 was incubated with GST alone, GST-tBid, or mutant GST-tBid (mtBH3) (G94E) immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose beads. B, BH1, BH2, and BH3 domains of Mcl-1 contribute to interaction with tBid. GST alone and GST-tBid were immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose beads and incubated with in vitro translated [35S]methionine-labeled Mcl-1 (upper panel) or Mcl-1mtBH1 (G262E mutation) (upper middle panel) or Mcl-1mtBH2 (W305A and W312A double mutations) (lower middle panel) or Mcl-1mtBH3 (G217E and D218A double mutations) (lower panel).

HNF-4α, a transcription factor belonging to the nuclear receptor superfamily, is expressed in pancreatic islets as well as in the liver, kidney, and intestine. However, the role of HNF-4α in pancreatic β-cell is unclear. To clarify the role of HNF-4α in β-cells, we generated β-cell-specific HNF-4α knock-out (βHNF-4αKO) mice using the Cre-LoxP system. The βHNF-4αKO mice exhibited impairment of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, which is a characteristic of MODY1. Pancreatic islet morphology, β-cell mass, and insulin content were normal in the HNF-4α mutant mice. Insulin secretion by βHNF-4αKO islets and the intracellular calcium response were impaired after stimulation by glucose or sulfonylurea but were normal after stimulation with KCl or arginine. Both NAD(P)H generation and ATP content at high glucose concentrations were normal in the βHNF-4αKO mice. Expression levels of Kir6.2 and SUR1 proteins in the βHNF-4αKO mice were unchanged as compared with control mice. Patch clamp experiments revealed that the current density was significantly increased in βHNF-4αKO mice compared with control mice. These results are suggestive of the dysfunction of KATP channel activity in the pancreatic β-cells of HNF-4α-deficient mice. Because the KATP channel is important for proper insulin secretion in β-cells, altered KATP channel activity could be related to the impaired insulin secretion in the βHNF-4αKO mice.

Zhong W.M. Lai E. Darnell Jr., J.E. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 2353-2365Crossref PubMed Scopus (845) Google Scholar). Similar to other nuclear receptors, HNF-4α has several functional domains, including the N-terminal transactivation domain (AF-1), a DNA-binding domain, a functionally complex C-terminal region that forms a ligand-binding domain, and a dimerization interface and a transactivation domain (AF-2). In the liver, HNF-4α plays an important role in regulating various genes involved in glucose, fatty acid, amino acid, and cholesterol metabolism, as well as blood coagulation and hepatic development and differentiation (2Chen W.S. Manova K. Weinstein D.C. Duncan S.A. Plump A.S. Prezioso V.R. Bachvarova R.F. Darnell Jr., J.E. Genes Dev. 1994; 15: 2466-2477Crossref Scopus (477) Google Scholar, 3Sladek F.M. Seidel S.D. Burris T.P. McCabe E. Nuclear Receptors and Genetic Diseases. Academic Press, London, UK2001: 309-361Google Scholar). Maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) is a genetically heterogeneous monogenic disorder that accounts for 2-5% of type 2 diabetes. It is characterized by autosomal dominant inheritance and an early age of onset (usually at <25 years old) (4Fajans S.S. Bell G.I. Polonsky K.S. N. Engl. J. Med. 2001; 345: 971-980Crossref PubMed Scopus (836) Google Scholar). We have shown previously that heterozygous mutations of the HNF-4α gene can cause a particular form of MODY (MODY1) (5Yamagata K. Furuta H. Oda N. Kaisaki P.J. Menzel S. Cox N.J. Fajans S.S. Signorini S. Stoffel M. Bell G.I. Nature. 1996; 384: 458-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (1035) Google Scholar). Functional studies of the mutations in MODY1 patients have shown that the diabetes is caused by loss-of-function mutations (6Stoffel M. Duncan S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13209-13214Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar, 7Yang Q. Yamagata K. Yamamoto K. Cao Y. Miyagawa J. Fukamizu A. Hanafusa T. Matsuzawa Y. Diabetologia. 2000; 43: 520-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Clinical studies have also shown that the primary cause of MODY1 is an impairment of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion by pancreatic β-cells rather than liver dysfunction (8Byrne M.M. Sturis J. Fajans S.S. Ortiz F.J. Stoltz A. Stoffel M. Smith M.J. Bell G.I. Halter J.B. Polonsky K.S. Diabetes. 1995; 44: 699-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 9Herman W.H. Fajans S.S. Smith M.J. Polonsky K.S. Bell G.I. Halter J.B. Diabetes. 1997; 46: 1749-1754Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), indicating that loss of HNF-4α leads to abnormal insulin secretion from the β-cells. In addition, recent genetic studies have shown that single nucleotide polymorphisms in the P2 (pancreatic β-cell type) promoter of the HNF-4α gene are associated with type 2 diabetes in some populations (10Love-Gregory L.D. Wasson J. Ma J. Jin C.H. Glaser B. Suarez B.K. Permutt M.A. Diabetes. 2004; 53: 1134-1140Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 11Silander K. Mohlke K.L. Scott L.J. Peck E.C. Hollstein P.

Thus, not only do HNF-4α mutations cause MODY, but variations of the HNF-4α gene are associated with a genetic predisposition to common type 2 diabetes. These findings suggest that HNF-4α in pancreatic β-cells has an important role in maintaining normal glucose metabolism. Previous in vitro studies have revealed that HNF-4α regulates the expression of pancreatic β-cell genes involved in glucose metabolism (e.g. insulin and glucose transporter-2 (GLUT2)) as well as HNF-1α (13Wang H. Maechler P. Antinozzi P.A. Hagenfeldt K.A. Wollheim C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35953-35959Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). HNF-1α is a target gene of HNF-4α in the liver (14Kuo C.J. Conley P.B. Chen L. Sladek F.M. Darnell Jr., J.E. Crabtree G.R. Nature. 1992; 355: 457-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar), and mutations of the HNF-1α gene cause type 3 of MODY (MODY3) (15Yamagata K. Oda N. Kaisaki P.J. Menzel S. Furuta H. Vaxillaire M. Southam L. Cox R.D. Lathrop G.M. Boriraj V.V. Chen X. Cox N.J. Oda Y. Yano H. Le Beau M.M. Yamada S. Nishigori H. Takeda J. Fajans S.S. Hattersley A.T. Iwasaki N. Hansen T. Pedersen O.

However, the role of HNF-4α in the regulation of pancreatic β-cell gene expression and its correlation with metabolism-secretion coupling are still unclear. Targeted disruption of the hnf4α gene in mice results in early embryonic death because of dysfunction of the visceral endoderm (2Chen W.S. Manova K. Weinstein D.C. Duncan S.A. Plump A.S. Prezioso V.R. Bachvarova R.F. Darnell Jr., J.E. Genes Dev. 1994; 15: 2466-2477Crossref Scopus (477) Google Scholar), and this embryonic lethality prevents further analysis of the role of HNF-4α in pancreatic β-cells. Furthermore, in contrast to humans, heterozygous hnf4α (+/-) mice exhibit normal glucose tolerance (6Stoffel M. Duncan S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13209-13214Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). To examine the role of HNF-4α in pancreatic β-cells, we specifically disrupted HNF-4α in β-cells by employing the Cre-loxP system. Pancreatic β-cell-specific HNF-4α knock-out mice (βHNF-4αKO mice) were viable and exhibited impairment of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, which is a characteristic of human MODY1. The secretory response of insulin and the intracellular Ca2+ response to glucose or tolbutamide were reduced in isolated HNF-4α mutant islets. Insulin secretion and the intracellular Ca2+ response to glucose or tolbutamide were decreased in isolated mutant HNF-4α islets. In addition, the responsiveness of the KATP channel current density to high glucose was decreased in βHNF-4αKO mice. Animals and Genotyping—HNF-4αflox/flox mice with loxP sites flanking exons 4 and 5 of the HNF-4α gene were generated as described previously (16Hayhurst G.P. Lee Y.H. Lambert G. Ward J.M. Gonzalez F.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 1393-1403Crossref PubMed Scopus (843) Google Scholar). Mice expressing Cre recombinase under control of the rat insulin 2 gene promoter (RIP-Cre) have been described elsewhere (17Kulkarni R.N. Bruning J.C. Winnay J.N. Postic C. Magnuson M.A. Kahn C.R. Cell. 1999; 96: 329-339Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (929) Google Scholar). RIP-Cre mice were backcrossed onto the C57BL/6 genetic background more than seven generations and maintained. Heterozygous (flox/wt) mice carrying one copy of the RIP-Cre transgene were interbred with flox/wt littermates lacking Cre (more than three generations) to generate pancreatic β-cell-specific HNF-4α knock-out mice (βHNF-4αKO) and littermate control mice (flox/flox (FLOX), RIP-Cre (CRE), and wt/wt (WT)). Age- and sex-matched littermates were used as the controls. The mice were genetic hybrids of C57BL/6 and 129/SvJ mice. Genotyping of HNF-4α was performed by PCR, as described previously (16Hayhurst G.P. Lee Y.H. Lambert G. Ward J.M. Gonzalez F.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 1393-1403Crossref PubMed Scopus (843) Google Scholar). PCR to detect the Cre transgene was achieved with 35 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 60 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 30 s using the following specific primers: RIP-CreF (5′-TTACCGGTCGATGCAACGAGTGATG-3′) and RIP-CreR (5′-TTCCATGAGTGAACGAACCTGGTCG-3′). This study was performed according to the guidelines of the Animal Ethics Committee of Osaka University. Western Blot Analysis—Pancreatic islets were isolated from mice by collagenase digestion, and the cells were lysed in extraction buffer (100 mmol/liter NaCl, 50 mmol/liter Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 20 mmol/liter EDTA, and 1% SDS). Total protein was separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, and probed with an antibody for HNF-4α (1Sladek F.M. Zhong W.M. Lai E. Darnell Jr., J.E. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 2353-2365Crossref PubMed Scopus (845) Google Scholar, 18Ihara A. Yamagata K. Nammo T. Miura A. Yuan M. Tanaka T. Sladek F.M. Matsuzawa Y. Miyagawa J. Shimomura I. Biochem.

Bound antibodies were detected with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Promega), and immune complexes were visualized using ECL Western blotting detection reagents (Amersham Biosciences). The images were scanned and quantified using ScanningImager and ImageQuant software (Amersham Biosciences). Measurement of Glucose and Insulin Levels—Blood glucose levels were determined with a glucometer (Glutest Ace, Sanwa Kagaku, Japan). Plasma insulin concentrations were determined with a Glazyme insulin enzyme immunoassay kit (Wako, Japan). The pancreatic insulin content or islet insulin content was measured after extraction by the acid-ethanol method (19Yamagata K. Nammo T. Moriwaki M. Ihara A. Iizuka K. Yang Q. Satoh T. Li M. Uenaka R. Okita K. Iwahashi H. Zhu Q. Cao Y. Imagawa A. Tochino Y. Hanafusa T. Miyagawa J. Matsuzawa Y. Diabetes. 2002; 51: 114-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). A glucose tolerance test was performed at 10 and 24 weeks of age. Mice were fasted for 14 h, and blood was collected before and at 15, 30, 60, and 120 min after the intraperitoneal injection of glucose (1 g/kg or 2 g/kg). For the insulin tolerance test, mice were injected with 1.0 units/kg of regular human insulin after a 4-h fast. Immunohistochemical Analysis—Under general anesthesia, 24-week-old mice were perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 mmol/liter phosphate buffer. Then the pancreas was harvested and fixed in the same solution for 12 h. Immunohistochemical analysis was performed using 6-μm sections of paraffin-embedded pancreatic tissues and the following primary antibodies: guinea pig anti-swine insulin (1:5,000) (Dako, Carpinteria, CA); rabbit anti-human glucagon (1:1,000) (Linco Research Inc., St. Charles, MO); rabbit anti-human somatostatin (1:200) (Dako); rabbit anti-human pancreatic polypeptide (1:1,000) (Dako); and mouse anti-human HNF-4α (1:200) (H1415, Perseus, Japan). The fluorescent-labeled secondary antibodies were biotinylated goat anti-guinea pig IgG (for insulin) (1:200) (Vector Laboratories), biotinylated goat anti-rabbit IgG (for glucagon, somatostatin, and pancreatic polypeptide) (1:200) (Vector Laboratories), and biotin-SP-conjugated AffiniPure donkey anti-mouse IgG (Jackson Immuno Research) (1:200). For amplification of the HNF-4α signal, a TSA kit (Molecular Probes) was used according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Immunofluorescence was detected under a light microscope (Olympus, Tokyo) or a laser scan confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss, Jena). For quantitation of β-cell mass, three mice of each genotype were analyzed at 24 weeks of age. Sections of paraffin-embedded pancreatic tissue were cut at 300-μm intervals and immunostained. The β-cell area was calculated as a percentage of the total pancreatic area, as described previously (19Yamagata K. Nammo T. Moriwaki M. Ihara A. Iizuka K. Yang Q. Satoh T. Li M. Uenaka R. Okita K. Iwahashi H. Zhu Q. Cao Y. Imagawa A. Tochino Y. Hanafusa T. Miyagawa J. Matsuzawa Y. Diabetes. 2002; 51: 114-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Quantitation of mRNA by Real Time RT-PCR—Total RNA was isolated from the pancreatic islets of βHNF-4αKO mice and flox/flox (FLOX) mice in Trizol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. cDNA was synthesized by using a High capacity cDNA archive kit (Applied Biosystems), and real time PCR was performed with an ABI PRISM 7900 (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) using specific primers and fluorescent probes. The primers and probes for GLUT2, insulin 1, insulin 2, glucokinase, glucose-6-phosphatase, aldolase B, SNAP-25, syntaxin 1, VDCC, Kir6.2, PDX-1, NeuroD, Nkx6.1, Pax6, Foxo1, PGC-1α, HNF-1β, SHP, PPARα, and TATA box-binding protein were all purchased from Applied Biosystems. Perifusion Experiments—Pancreatic islets were isolated from βHNF4-αKO mice and control mice at the age of 20-24 weeks by collagenase digestion. Islets were cultured overnight prior to the following experiments. Ten islets were perifused at 37 °C with Hepes-Krebs buffer (118.4 mm NaCl, 4.7 mm KCl, 1.2 mm KH2PO4, 2.4 mm CaCl2, 1.2 mm MgSO4, 20 mm NaHCO3, 2.8 mm glucose, and 10 mm Hepes) containing 0.5% (w/v) bovine serum albumin (BSA) (equilibrated with 5% CO2, 95% air (pH 7.4)) at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. After perifusion with 2.8 mm glucose for 40 min, the solutions were altered as indicated in Fig. 5. Batch Incubation Experiments—Batch incubation was performed as described previously (19Yamagata K. Nammo T. Moriwaki M. Ihara A. Iizuka K. Yang Q. Satoh T. Li M. Uenaka R. Okita K. Iwahashi H. Zhu Q. Cao Y. Imagawa A. Tochino Y. Hanafusa T. Miyagawa J. Matsuzawa Y. Diabetes. 2002; 51: 114-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Briefly, pancreatic islets (10 per tube) were preincubated at 37 °C for 60 min in Hepes-Krebs buffer supplemented with 0.5% (w/v) BSA. Then the islets were incubated for 30 min in 350 μl of the same buffer containing 500 μm tolbutamide or the buffer containing 16.7 mm glucose in the presence or absence of 1 nm GLP-1 (Peptide Institution, Osaka, Japan). Intracellular Ca2+ Concentration of Pancreatic Islets—The cytosolic Ca2+ concentration was measured with fura-2 acetoxymethyl ester using two-photon excitation imaging as described previously (20Takahashi N. Kishimoto T. Nemoto T. Kadowaki T. Kasai H. Science. 2002; 297: 1349-1352Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar, 21Fukui K. Yang Q. Cao Y. Takahashi N. Hatakeyama H. Wang H. Wada J. Zhang Y.

In brief, isolated islets were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min in serum-free Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium culture medium supplemented with bovine serum albumin (1 mg/ml), 0.1% Pluronic F-127, and 20 μm fura-2 acetoxymethyl ester (Molecular Probes), followed by washing with Sol A (140 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm Hepes-NaOH (pH 7.3), and 2.8 mm glucose). The laser power at the specimen was set at 10 milliwatts, and the excitation wavelength was 830 nm. Images were acquired every 2.5 s. The cytosolic Ca2+ concentrations in response to 20 mm glucose, 1 μm glibenclamide, and 30 mm KCl were calculated as (F0 - F)/F0, where F0 and F represent the resting and post-stimulation fluorescence, respectively. Measurement of NAD(P)H Fluorescence—Autofluorescence of NAD(P)H (400-510 nm) in the islets was imaged using two-photon excitation microscopy at an excitation wavelength of 720 nm (22Noda M. Yamashita S. Takahashi N. Eto K. Shen L.M. Izumi K. Daniel S. Tsubamoto Y. Nemoto T. Iino M. Kasai H. Sharp G.W. Kadowaki T. J. Biol.

Measurement of the Islet ATP Content—The ATP content of pancreatic islets was measured by a quantitative bioluminescence assay using a modification of the protocol described previously (23Dukes I.D.

Experiments were performed on islets from βHNF-4αKO mice and control mice after incubation for 48 h in RPMI 1640 medium containing 11 mm glucose. Groups of 10 islets (diameter 0.15-0.2 mm) were selected manually and preincubated in KRB containing 3 mm glucose for 60 min. After preincubation, the islets were incubated for 30 min in buffer containing 3 or 20 mm glucose. Then ATP was extracted from the islets and assayed using an ATP bioluminescence assay kit (CLS II, Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Immunofluorescent Staining of Kir6.2—Islets were dispersed by trituration (200 passes through a pipette with a 200-μl tip) in Ca2+- and Mg2+-free Hanks’ solution. The cells were then plated on Lab-TekII chamber slides (Nalge Nunc) and cultured for 2-3 days. For surface staining (24Taschenberger G. Mougey A. Shen S. Lester L.B. LaFranchi S. Shyng S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 17139-17146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), the cells were incubated with anti-Kir6.2 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-11228) at 4 °C. For total cellular staining of Kir6.2 or SUR1, the cells were permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline and then incubated with anti-Kir6.2 antibody (sc-11228) or anti-SUR1 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-25683). Patch Clamp Recording—A patch clamp technique (25Hamill O.P. Marty A. Neher E. Sakmann B. Sigworth F.J. Pfluegers Arch. 1981; 391: 85-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (15069) Google Scholar, 26Nakazaki M. Kakei M. Koriyama N. Tanaka H. Diabetes. 1995; 44: 878-883Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was used to record whole-cell currents from perforated cells with the pipette solution containing nystatin (150 μg/ml) dissolved in 0.1% Me2SO. Membrane currents were recorded by using an amplifier (200B Axopatch, Molecular Devices, Foster City, CA), and data were stored on-line in a computer with pCLAMP8 software. Voltage clamp in the perforated mode was defined as adequate when series resistance was less than 20 megohms. The patch pipettes were pulled from glass tubes (Narishige Co. Ltd., Tokyo, Japan). The resistance of each pipette was between 4 and 7 megohms when filled with the following pipette solution (content in mm): K2SO4 40, KCl 50, MgCl2 5, EGTA 0.5, and Hepes 10 (pH 7.2) with KOH. The perforated whole-cell clamp mode was established within 5-10 min after formation of a gigaohm seal between the patch pipette and the membrane of an isolated β-cell. These cells were superfused with BSA-free Hepes-Krebs buffer containing 2.8 mm glucose for at least 30 min before the experiments. The capacitance of cells from control mice and βHNF-4αKO mice was 7.4 ± 2.1 picofarads (n = 20) and 7.6 ± 2.7 picofarads (n = 16), respectively. The β-cells were voltage-clamped at the holding potential of -70 mV, stepped to -100 mV for voltage ramping from -100 to -50 mV at a rate of 5 mV/100 ms, and then stepped back to -70 mV every 10 s. These experiments were performed at room temperature (22-25 °C). Statistical Analysis—Results were expressed as the mean ± S.E. Statistical analysis was performed with the unpaired t test, and differences were considered to be significant at p < 0.05. Generation of β-Cell-specific HNF-4α Knock-out Mice—Pancreatic β-cell-specific HNF-4α knock-out mice (βHNF-4αKO) were generated by breeding heterozygous HNF-4αflox/wt mice carrying one copy of the RIP-Cre transgene with HNF-4αflox/wt mice lacking the Cre gene (Fig. 1A). Because exons 4 and 5 of the HNF-4α gene are flanked by loxP sites, recombination with Cre leads to production of a truncated HNF-4α protein lacking part of the DNA-binding domain and the C-terminal ligand-binding and transactivation domain (16Hayhurst G.P. Lee Y.H. Lambert G. Ward J.M. Gonzalez F.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 1393-1403Crossref PubMed Scopus (843) Google Scholar). We examined the expression of HNF-4α in these mice by immunoblot analysis of pancreatic islets, liver, and kidney with HNF-4α antibody that recognizes the very C terminus of HNF-4α (1Sladek F.M. Zhong W.M. Lai E. Darnell Jr., J.E. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 2353-2365Crossref PubMed Scopus (845) Google Scholar, 18Ihara A. Yamagata K. Nammo T. Miura A. Yuan M. Tanaka T. Sladek F.M. Matsuzawa Y. Miyagawa J. Shimomura I. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 329: 984-990Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The expression of HNF-4α in the islets of βHNF-4αKO mice was found to be reduced by 81-84% (Fig. 1B). As expected, HNF-4α is expressed in pancreatic β-cells of wild-type mice (Fig. 1C, arrows). Immunostaining of pancreatic sections confirmed the efficient ablation of HNF-4α in β-cells of βHNF-4αKO mice (Fig. 1C). HNF-4α staining was detected in pancreatic non-β-cells of βHNF-4αKO mice (Fig. 1C, arrowheads). In contrast to the pancreatic β-cells, expression of HNF-4α was not decreased in the liver or kidney (Fig. 1D), indicating that there was a β-cell-selective loss of HNF-4α expression in these mice. Previous studies have shown that HNF-4α is a major regulator of HNF-1α gene expression in the liver, whereas HNF-1α regulates HNF-4α expression by pancreatic β-cells (27Boj S.F. Parrizas M. Maestro M.A. Ferrer J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 14481-14486Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). These findings suggest the existence of a positive feedback regulatory loop between HNF-4α and HNF-1α in the pancreatic β-cells. However, the expression of HNF-1α was not decreased in βHNF-4αKO islets (Fig. 1B), indicating that HNF-4α is not essential for HNF-1α expression by adult mouse β-cells. Impaired Glucose Tolerance in βHNF-4α Knock-out Mice—βHNF-4αKO mice were born in a Mendelian fashion (data not shown). On inspection, βHNF-4αKO mice were indistinguishable from their control littermates (wt/wt (WT), flox/flox (FLOX), and RIP-Cre (CRE)). Body weight (Fig. 2A) and the nonfasting blood glucose concentration (Fig. 2B) were similar in βHNF4αKO mice and control mice at both 10 and 24 weeks. Because random blood glucose levels were similar in the βHNF-4αKO mice and control littermates, the response to intraperitoneal administration of glucose was measured because this is a more sensitive determinant of glucose tolerance. Glucose tolerance was found to be normal in the male βHNF-4αKO mice at 10 weeks (Fig. 2C). However, glucose levels at 15, 30, 60, and 120 min after administration of a glucose load were significantly higher in female KO mice at 10 weeks (Fig. 2D). Female mutant mice also showed a poor initial response of insulin secretion after intraperitoneal injection of glucose. At 24 weeks, both male and female βHNF-4αKO mice exhibited glucose intolerance and an impaired insulin response to glucose loading (Fig. 2E). Most interestingly, the HNF-4α-deficient mice generated in this study showed no evidence of a decrease in blood glucose or elevation of plasma insulin levels in the fasting state (Fig. 2, C--F), as was reported in another strain of β-cell-specific HNF-4α knock-out mice (28Gupta R.K. Vatamaniuk M.Z. Lee C.S. Flaschen R.C. Fulmer J.T. Matschinsky F.M. Duncan S.A. Kaestner K.H. J. Clin. Investig. 2005; 115: 1006-1015Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Their knock-out mice also exhibited hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia in the fed state (28Gupta R.K. Vatamaniuk M.Z. Lee C.S. Flaschen R.C. Fulmer J.T. Matschinsky F.M. Duncan S.A. Kaestner K.H. J. Clin. Investig. 2005; 115: 1006-1015Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar), but our mutant animals also did not show hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia in the fed state (Fig. 2G). The insulin tolerance test did not reveal any significant difference in insulin sensitivity between βHNF-4αKO mice and control mice (Fig. 2H), excluding the possibility that the mutant mice were insulin-resistant. Pancreatic Histology and Insulin Content in βHNF-4αKO Mice—MODY3 model mice have an abnormal islet structure (19Yamagata K. Nammo T. Moriwaki M. Ihara A. Iizuka K. Yang Q. Satoh T. Li M. Uenaka R.

To determine whether any abnormalities of islet morphology were present, pancreatic sections from 24-week-old mice with different genotypes were examined by immunohistochemistry (Fig. 3A). It was found that the islet architecture was normal in βHNF-4αKO mice, featuring a core of β-cells surrounded by a layer of non-β-cells. Also, the islet levels of insulin, glucagon, somatostatin, and pancreatic polypeptide expression were similar in KO and control animals. Quantitative analysis revealed no significant difference in the islet mass, islet number, islet size distribution, and β-cell size between FLOX and KO mice (Fig. 3, B-D and supplemental Fig. 1). Furthermore, the pancreatic insulin content and insulin content of islets of βHNF-4αKO mice were similar to that of control mice (Fig. 3, E and F). These results suggested that loss of HNF-4α from pancreatic β-cells led to the impairment of β-cell function rather than causing abnormalities of islet differentiation or insulin biosynthesis. Pancreatic Islet Gene Expression—The effect of HNF-4α deficiency on gene expression was evaluated in the islets of 24-week-old βHNF-4α mice and FLOX mice by real time RT-PCR (Fig. 4). Previous in vitrostudies have suggested that insulin, HNF-1α, GLUT2, and aldolase B are target genes for HNF-4α in β-cells (13Wang H. Maechler P. A"
https://openalex.org/W2080039572,"Mice lacking the secreted extracellular superoxide dismutase (EC-SOD) or the cytosolic copper- and zinc-containing SOD (CuZn-SOD) show relatively mild phenotypes. To explore the possibility that the isoenzymes have partly overlapping functions, single and double knockout mice were examined. The absence of EC-SOD was found to be without effect on the lifespan of mice, and the reduced lifespan of CuZn-SOD knockouts was not further shortened by EC-SOD deficiency. The urinary excretion of isoprostanes was increased in CuZn-SOD knockout mice, and plasma thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances levels were elevated in EC-SOD knockout mice. These oxidant stress markers showed potentiated increases in the absence of both isoenzymes. Other alterations were mainly found in CuZn-SOD knockout mice, such as halved glutathione peroxidase activity in the tissues examined and increased glutathione and iron in the liver. There were no changes in tissue content of the alternative superoxide scavenger ascorbate, but there was a 25% reduction in ascorbate in blood plasma in mice lacking CuZn-SOD. No increase was found in the urinary excretion of the terminal metabolites of NO, nitrite, and nitrate in any of the genotypes. In conclusion, apart from the increases in the global urinary and plasma oxidant stress markers, our phenotype studies revealed no other evidence that the copper- and zinc-containing SOD isoenzymes have overlapping roles.

The superoxide radical is the oxygen radical formed in the greatest amount in the metabolism of molecular oxygen (1Halliwell B. Gutteridge J.M.C. Free Radicals in Biology and Medicine. 3rd. Oxford University Press Inc., New York1999: 34Google Scholar). It has been linked to multiple toxic effects, caused by both direct reactions with biomolecules (2Hausladen A. Fridovich I. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29405-29408Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and indirect reactions through interaction with transition metal ions (3Halliwell B. FEBS Lett. 1978; 92: 321-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar) and NO (4Beckman J.S. Koppenol W.H. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: C1424-C1437Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The superoxide radical formed by the NADPH oxidase of phagocytic cells participates in the innate immune defense (5Babior B.M. Am. J. Med. 2000; 109: 33-44Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (879) Google Scholar). This radical is also formed by other NAD(P)H oxidase isoforms in several different cell types and has been increasingly recognized to exert signaling effects (6Lambeth J.D. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2004; 4: 181-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (2468) Google Scholar). The superoxide radical is degraded by superoxide dismutases (SOD), 2The abbreviations used are: SOD, superoxide dismutase; EC-SOD, extracellular SOD; CuZn-SOD, Cu- and Zn-containing SOD; Mn-SOD, manganese-containing SOD; TBARS, thiobarbituric acid-reactive substance(s). GSHPX, glutathione peroxidase; GSH, reduced glutathione. which catalyze its disproportionation: 2O2·¯+2H+→H2O2+O2·¯. There are three isoenzymes in animals. CuZn-SOD occurs in the cytosol (7McCord J.M. Fridovich I. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 6049-6055Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the intermembrane space of mitochondria (8Weisiger R.A. Fridovich I. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 4793-4796Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and in the nucleus (9Chang L.Y. Slot J.W. Geuze H.J. Crapo J.D. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 2169-2179Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Mn-SOD is localized to the mitochondrial matrix (8Weisiger R.A. Fridovich I. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 4793-4796Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Weisiger R.A. Fridovich I. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 3582-3592Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). EC-SOD is secreted to the extracellular space, where the major part becomes anchored to sulfated glycosaminoglycans in the tissue interstitium (11Marklund S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 7634-7638Crossref PubMed Scopus (642) Google Scholar, 12Karlsson K. Sandstrom J. Edlund A. Marklund S.L. Lab. Investig. 1994; 70: 705-710PubMed Google Scholar). A smaller proportion is found in plasma and other extracellular fluids (13Karlsson K. Marklund S.L. Biochem. J. 1988; 255: 223-228PubMed Google Scholar). In some tissues EC-SOD mainly occurs intracellularly, possibly in secretory vesicles (14Oury T.D. Card J.P. Klann E. Brain Res. 1999; 850: 96-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). A nuclear localization has also been suggested (15Ookawara T. Kizaki T. Takayama E. Imazeki N. Matsubara O. Ikeda Y. Suzuki K. Li J.L. Tadakuma T. Taniguchi N. Ohno H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 296: 54-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Because the superoxide radical penetrates membranes poorly, the three SOD isoenzymes are generally assumed to have distinct roles in the body (16Winterbourn C.C. Stern A. J. Clin. Investig. 1987; 80: 1486-1491Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Mice lacking Mn-SOD show dramatic phenotypes with perinatal or early postnatal mortality (17Li Y. Huang T.T. Carlson E.J. Melov S. Ursell P.C. Olson J.L. Noble L.J. Yoshimura M.P. Berger C. Chan P.H. Wallace D.C. Epstein C.J. Nat. Genet. 1995; 11: 376-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (1455) Google Scholar, 18Lebovitz R.M. Zhang H. Vogel H. Cartwright Jr., J. Dionne L. Lu N. Huang S. Matzuk M.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9782-9787Crossref PubMed Scopus (838) Google Scholar). This implicates mitochondria as major cellular sources and targets of superoxide radicals. Even heterozygous knockouts show phenotypes, although they have a normal lifespan (19Van Remmen H. Ikeno Y. Hamilton M. Pahlavani M. Wolf N. Thorpe S.R. Alderson N.L. Baynes J.W. Epstein C.J. Huang T.T. Nelson J. Strong R. Richardson A. Physiol. Genomics. 2003; 16: 29-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar). The phenotype of Mn-SOD knockouts is not affected by overexpression of CuZn-SOD (20Copin J.C. Gasche Y. Chan P.H. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2000; 28: 1571-1576Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). In contrast, mice lacking EC-SOD appear healthy and show no obvious spontaneous phenotype (21Carlsson L.M. Jonsson J. Edlund T. Marklund S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6264-6268Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). When stressed, for example by high oxygen tension, they, unlike CuZn-SOD knockouts (22Ho Y.S. Gargano M. Cao J. Bronson R.T. Heimler I. Hutz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7765-7769Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar), die prematurely (21Carlsson L.M. Jonsson J. Edlund T. Marklund S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6264-6268Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). Likewise, CuZn-SOD knockouts appear healthy, but females show reduced fertility (22Ho Y.S. Gargano M. Cao J. Bronson R.T. Heimler I. Hutz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7765-7769Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar), and degeneration of axons has been demonstrated (23Reaume A.G. Elliott J.L. Hoffman E.K. Kowall N.W. Ferrante R.J. Siwek D.F. Wilcox H.M. Flood D.G. Beal M.F. Brown Jr., R.H. Scott R.W. Snider W.D. Nat. Genet. 1996; 13: 43-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (1048) Google Scholar). The CuZn-SOD knockouts also show shortened lifespan, mainly caused by the development of hepatocellular carcinomas (24Elchuri S. Oberley T.D. Qi W. Eisenstein R.S. Jackson R.L. Van Remmen H. Epstein C.J. Huang T.T. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 367-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar). Possibly the relatively modest phenotypes of EC-SOD and CuZn-SOD knockouts can be explained by partial functional overlap of the isoenzymes. To investigate this possibility, we examined biochemical phenotypes of double and single EC-SOD and CuZn-SOD knockouts. Furthermore, because oxygen free radicals have been implicated in aging in many studies in a variety of species (25Landis G.N. Tower J. Mech. Ageing Dev. 2005; 126: 365-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar), the lifespans associated with the various SOD mutant genotypes were studied. Mice—EC-SOD null mutant mice (female, background: five times backcrossed with C57BL/6), (21Carlsson L.M. Jonsson J. Edlund T. Marklund S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6264-6268Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar) were bred with male CuZn-SOD null mutant mice (background 129/CD1) (23Reaume A.G. Elliott J.L. Hoffman E.K. Kowall N.W. Ferrante R.J. Siwek D.F. Wilcox H.M. Flood D.G. Beal M.F. Brown Jr., R.H. Scott R.W. Snider W.D. Nat. Genet. 1996; 13: 43-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (1048) Google Scholar). The double heterozygous offspring were then bred to each other to generate homozygous double mutant mice, single null mutants, and wild-type littermates. Various other combinations from these litters were also thereafter used in breeding to generate the desired genotypes (see Table 1). The EC-SOD genotype was determined by PCR with primers specific for the gene and for the neomycin gene disruption insert (26Hjalmarsson K. Marklund S.L. Engstrom A. Edlund T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 6340-6344Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar, 21Carlsson L.M. Jonsson J. Edlund T. Marklund S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6264-6268Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). The CuZn-SOD genotype was determined by measuring CuZn-SOD activity in whole blood (27Marklund S. J. Biol.

CRC Press Inc., Boca Raton, FL1985: 249-255Google Scholar). The pups were weaned at 3 weeks of age and then maintained on a 12-h day and night cycle with food and water provided ad libitum. The study followed the “Principles of Laboratory Animal Care” (National Institutes of Health publication 86-23, revised 1985) and was approved by the local animal ethics committee. The samples for the biochemical analyses were generally collected at 3 months of age. Another group of mice was kept and monitored during aging.TABLE 1Fertilities of breeding combinations of EC-SOD and CuZn-SOD null mutant miceGenotype maleGenotype femaleNumber of littersLitter sizepEe/CcEe/Cc367.8 ± 3.8ee/Ccee/Cc407.4 ± 2.7ee/ccee/Cc158.9 ± 2.9EE/CcEE/Cc108.5 ± 3.9EE/ccEE/Cc29, 7 Open table in a new tab NO Turnover Study—The mice were kept on a fluid nutrient lacking nitrite and nitrate (50 g/liter glucose, 40 mm sodium, and 20 mm potassium) for 6 days. The mice were put in clean cages each day to limit the complication of feces being an external source of nitrate. Urine samples were collected on days 5 and 6 by holding the mice over a clean surface and applying a gentle pressure on the stomach to induce micturition. The urine was immediately collected and stored at –80 °C until assayed. Chemical Analysis—Serum iron and total iron binding capacity were determined with a reagent kit from Roche Applied Science. The iron and copper content of mouse liver was analyzed with inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry. Urine creatinine was determined in a Vitros 950 apparatus (Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics). Thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBARS) in EDTA plasma were measured by fluorimetry (29Kojima T. Kikugawa K. Kosugi H. Chem. Pharm. Bull. 1990; 38: 3414-3418Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 30Moore K. Roberts L.J. Free Radic. Res. 1998; 28: 659-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar). Unextracted urine (50 μl) was analyzed for 8-iso-prostaglandin F2α by radioimmunoassay (31Basu S. Prostaglandins Leukot. Essent. Fatty Acids. 1998; 58: 319-325Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Nitrite plus nitrate in urine were analyzed using a nitric oxide assay kit from R & D Systems Inc. (Minneapolis, MN). Glutathione and Ascorbate Analysis—Tissues and plasma were homogenized in 50 g/liter metaphosphorous acid, at a 1:10 (w/v) ratio. After centrifugation for 15 min at 15,000 × g, the supernatant was stored at –80 °C until analysis. The reduced glutathione GSH content was determined with a kit, GSH 400, from Oxis Research (Portland OR). Ascorbate was analyzed by high pressure liquid chromatography using an electrochemical detector (32Stralin P. Jacobsson H. Marklund S.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1619: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Analysis of Enzymes—Tissues were homogenized with an Ultraturrax in 10 volumes of 50 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.4) with 0.3 m KBr containing the Complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science) and centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 15 min. The SOD activity of the supernatants was determined by the direct spectrophotometric method using KO2 (27Marklund S. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 7504-7507Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Marklund S.L. Greenwald R. Handbook of Methods for Oxygen Radical Research. CRC Press Inc., Boca Raton, FL1985: 249-255Google Scholar). To distinguish between the resistant isoenzyme Mn-SOD and the sensitive isoenzymes CuZn-SOD and EC-SOD, 3 mm cyanide was used. The glycoprotein EC-SOD was separated by its binding to a concanavalin A-Sepharose column (21Carlsson L.M. Jonsson J. Edlund T. Marklund S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6264-6268Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar, 33Marklund S.L. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 349: 74-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The CuZn-SOD activity is calculated as the total cyanide-sensitive activity minus the EC-SOD activity. The detection limits in the procedure are for CuZn-SOD, EC-SOD, and Mn-SOD 5 (20 ng), 50 (430 ng), and 5 (325 ng) units/g of wet weight, respectively. Glutathione peroxidase (GSHPX) was determined by a coupled spectrophotometric method (34Marklund S.L. Westman N.G. Lundgren E. Roos G. Cancer Res. 1982; 42: 1955-1961PubMed Google Scholar). Catalase was determined by following the disproportionation of hydrogen peroxide at 240 nm (35Marklund S.L. Santavuori P. Westermarck T. Clin. Chim. Acta. 1981; 116: 191-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). For aconitase analysis the protocol of Huang et al. (36Huang T.T. Raineri I. Eggerding F. Epstein C.J. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 349: 191-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) was followed. Statistics—Differences between the various groups of mice were evaluated using the nonparametric Mann-Whitney U test. Survival curves were made from Kaplan-Meier plots, and the survival statistics were calculated with Cox regression, Forward:Wald. Unless otherwise stated, the values (number of animals) in the tables are presented as the means ± S.D. Breeding, Body Weight, and Lifespan of Mice—Several genotype combinations were used to produce the single and double EC-SOD and CuZn-SOD knockouts, all resulting in similar litter sizes (Table 1).

Open table in a new tab Oxidative Stress Markers—The urinary excretion of the isoprostane 8-iso-prostaglandin F2α is a specific marker for the extent of systemic lipid peroxidation (30Moore K. Roberts L.J. Free Radic. Res. 1998; 28: 659-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar). Although there was no change in EC-SOD null mice, there was a significant increase in excretion of this marker in the CuZn-SOD null mice. This increase was enhanced by the additional absence of EC-SOD (Table 3). Overall, the females of all genotypes had higher excretion rates than the males. TBARS are nonspecific markers of systemic lipid peroxidation (30Moore K. Roberts L.J. Free Radic. Res. 1998; 28: 659-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar, 29Kojima T. Kikugawa K. Kosugi H. Chem. Pharm. Bull. 1990; 38: 3414-3418Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The plasma TBARS levels were slightly elevated in EC-SOD null mice, but not in the CuZn-SOD knockouts. There was a marked potentiation in the double knockout mice, however. Nitric Oxide Turnover—Nitric oxide reacts rapidly with superoxide to form peroxynitrite (38Huie R.E. Padmaja S. Free Radic. Res. Commun. 1993; 18: 195-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (2022) Google Scholar). The absence of SOD isoenzymes should increase the consumption of NO, which could conceivably be produced in increased amounts through autoregulation. The production of NO in the body can be estimated by analysis of the stable metabolites nitrite and nitrate in urine. There was no difference, however, in nitrate plus nitrite excretion in the urine between any of the genotypes in the study (Table 3). Iron and Copper Analysis—The superoxide radical can influence iron and iron turnover in several different ways (2Hausladen A. Fridovich I. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29405-29408Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3Halliwell B. FEBS Lett. 1978; 92: 321-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar, 39Biemond P. Swaak A.J. Beindorff C.M. Koster J.F. Biochem. J. 1986; 239: 169-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). The iron regulatory protein-1, also known as cytosolic aconitase, is inactivated by superoxide radicals through disruption of the FeS cubane cluster (40Missirlis F. Hu J. Kirby K. Hilliker A.J. Rouault T.A. Phillips J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 47365-47369Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). This could cause increased uptake of iron in tissues. Cytosolic aconitase was found to be undetectable in livers from CuZn-SOD knockout mice but was present at normal levels in EC-SOD knockout mice (Fig. 3). The liver iron content was increased by about 50% in CuZn-SOD null mice and in the double knockouts (Table 4). There was also a 20% increase in serum iron in the CuZn-SOD null mice, whereas no effect of the absence of EC-SOD could be discerned. No statistically significant differences in total iron binding capacity were found (not shown). The copper levels in livers of CuZn-SOD knockouts were nearly halved (Table 4).TABLE 4Iron and copper in 3-month-old miceGenotypeSexSerum ironIron in liverCopper in liverμmmg/kg of wet weightmg/kg of wet weightEE/CCF31.6 ± 4.9 (10)90.5 ± 33.4 (7)4.57 ± 0.29 (5)M33.6 ± 7.5 (11)5.97 ± 0.52 (5)Total32.6 ± 6.3 (21)5.27 ± 0.84 (10)ee/CCF32.5 ± 3.2 (6)99.4 ± 36.6 (10)M34.7 ± 5.0 (10)Total33.9 ± 4.4 (16)EE/ccF38.4 ± 11.6(10)aMann Whitney U test, p < 0.05 compared with EE/CC animals.138.3 ± 38.7 (9)aMann Whitney U test, p < 0.05 compared with EE/CC animals.,bMann-Whitney U test, p < 0.05 compared with ee/CC animals.2.57 ± 0.21 (5)cMann Whitney U test, p < 0.01 compared with EE/CC animals.M40.0 ± 5.7 (10)aMann Whitney U test, p < 0.05 compared with EE/CC animals.,bMann-Whitney U test, p < 0.05 compared with ee/CC animals.2.97 ± 0.22 (5)cMann Whitney U test, p < 0.01 compared with EE/CC animals.Total39.2 ± 8.9 (20)bMann-Whitney U test, p < 0.05 compared with ee/CC animals.,cMann Whitney U test, p < 0.01 compared with EE/CC animals.2.77 ± 0.29 (10)dMann Whitney U test, p < 0.001 compared with EE/CC animals.ee/ccF36.6 ± 7.5 (8)142.5 ± 29.2 (10)aMann Whitney U test, p < 0.05 compared with EE/CC animals.,bMann-Whitney U test, p < 0.05 compared with ee/CC animals.M39.4 ± 5.6 (2)Total37.1 ± 7.0 (10)a Mann Whitney U test, p < 0.05 compared with EE/CC animals.b Mann-Whitney U test, p < 0.05 compared with ee/CC animals.c Mann Whitney U test, p < 0.01 compared with EE/CC animals.d Mann Whitney U test, p < 0.001 compared with EE/CC animals.

These enzymes remodel the 6-O-sulfation of cell surface HS chains to promote Wnt signaling and inhibit growth factor signaling for embryonic tissue patterning and control of tumor growth. In this study we demonstrate that the avian HS endosulfatases, QSulf1 and QSulf2, exhibit the same substrate specificity toward a subset of trisulfated disaccharides internal to HS chains. Further, we show that both QSulfs associate exclusively with cell membrane and are enzymatically active on the cell surface to desulfate both cell surface and cell matrix HS. Mutagenesis studies reveal that conserved amino acid regions in the hydrophilic domains of QSulf1 and QSulf2 have multiple functions, to anchor Sulf to the cell surface, bind to HS substrates, and to mediate HS 6-O-endosulfatase enzymatic activity.

Importantly, QSulf1 expression in muscle and neuronal lineages is dependent on Sonic hedgehog signaling during embryogenesis (10Dhoot G.K. Gustafsson M.K. Ai X. Sun W. Standiford D.M.

In specific tumors, QSulf1 expression is absent, even though Sulf1 is expressed in normal progenitor lineages thought to give rise to these tumors (14Lai J. Chien J. Staub J. Avula R. Greene E.L.

The signaling functions of Sulfs are based on their unique activities as HS 6-O-endosulfatases to remodel that enzymatically remove 6-O-sulfate groups from a subset of internal trisulfated disaccharides located in internal sulfated domains of HS chains on the cell surface (11Morimoto-Tomita M.

By contrast, the lysosomal GlcNR6Sase has exosulfatase activity that removes the 6-O-sulfate groups from terminal glucosamine residues of oligosaccharide intermediates during lysosomal HS catabolism (19Kresse H. Paschke E. von Figura K. Gilberg W. Fuchs M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 6822-6826Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Sulfs and GlcNR6Sase share extensive sequence homology within their enzymatic and C-terminal domains (10Dhoot G.K. Gustafsson M.K. Ai X. Sun W. Standiford D.M. Emerson Jr., C.P. Science. 2001; 293: 1663-1666Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). However, QSulf1 has a centrally located hydrophilic domain (HD) that is required for associating QSulf1 on the cell surface. In this study we have investigated the cell surface association, endosulfatase activity, and substrate specificity of QSulf1 and QSulf2 and the essential roles of the HD domain in QSulf enzymatic properties. We report that QSulf1 and QSulf2 both function as HS 6-O-endosulfatase with identical HS substrate specificities. Our findings also provide evidence that QSulfs are enzymatically active and function on the cell surface to modify the 6-O-sulfation states of cell surface and matrix HS, supporting the conclusion that Sulf enzymes function dynamically on the cell surface. Finally, we show that the conserved sequences in Sulf1 and Sulf2 HD domains have multiple functions in GAG substrate binding, cell surface association, and endosulfatase activity. Cloning of QSulf2 cDNA—A stage 12 quail cDNA library was screened under low stringency conditions using a cDNA probe of the QSulf1 enzymatic domain. Five positive clones were identified, including one 4.3-kb cDNA clone that was fully sequenced and contains the full-length QSulf2 cDNA (GenBank™ AY766468). The QSulf2 cDNA was cloned by PCR into a pAG-His-Myc (C-terminal tag) mammalian expression vector. The hydrophilic domain of QSulf2 (QSulf2HD) contains conserved sequences (QSulf2HDC) and a not so conserved middle subdomain. The boundary of the middle subdomain was determined by a comparison with the Sulf2 gene in human and mouse in which the middle subdomain was encoded by two adjacent exons. An overlap extension PCR protocol was used to generate various deletions in QSulf2HD, including deletions of the middle domain, the conserved C-terminal sequences, and a cluster of 14 basic amino acid residues (C14). QSulf2HD, HDC, HDS, and HDΔC14 were cloned into pAG3-Myc with an N-terminal secretion signal peptide and a Myc tag. Primers used in the studies are as follows: for cloning of QSulf2 into pAG-His-Myc expression vector, forward primer 5′-GGTACCATGGCACAGCATAGTCTTGT-3′ and reverse primer 5′-CTCGAGGCCTTCCCATCCTTCCCA-3′; for cloning of QSulf2 HD into pAG3-Myc expression vector, forward primer 5′-GGTACCAAACTGCTGCATAAGAGGGA-3′ and reverse primer 5′-CTCGAGCAATGTCCAGAGGGGCGC-3′; for deletion of QSulf2HD, forward primer 5′-CTAGTGGAGAGAGGCTTGGGTCCTTTCTGTGCTTGT-3′ and reverse primer 5′-ACAGAAAGGACCCAAGCCTCTCTCCACTAGGAATGA-3′; for deletion of the middle subdomain of QSulf2HD, forward primer 5′-GCTTGTGAGCAGCTTGGCAGGTGTTACATCCTGGAGAAT-3′ and reverse primer 5′-CTCCAGGATGTAACACCTGCCAAGCTGCTCACAAGCTGT-3′; for deletion of the conversed fragment in QSulf2HD, forward primer 5′-CTGATCAAAGTGACACACGGTCCTTTCTGTGCTTGTACC-3′ and reverse primer 5′-ACAAGCACAGAAAGGACCGTGTGTCACTTTGATCAGATT-3′; and for deletion of the cluster of basic amino acid residues at the C terminus of QSulf2HD, forward primer 5′-TGGCTGCTTCGAGAGCAAAACAACGACACGTGCAGC-3′ and reverse primer 5′-GCACGTGTCGTTGTTTTGCTCTCGAAGCAGCCACAG-3′. The PCR products were cloned into T-easy vector (Promega), sequenced, and subsequently inserted into pAG-Myc expression vector. The amino acid sequences of QSulf2, MSulf2, HSulf2, and QSulf1 were compared and aligned using MacVector. Cell Culture and Transfection—293T cells were maintained in a 100-mm dish in culture medium (Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium + 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone) + 1% antibiotics) and transfected using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. After 48 h, cells were lysed in 500 μl of 0.25% Triton X-100 with protease inhibitor cocktails (Roche Applied Science). 293T cell lines that stably express QSulf1 or QSulf2 were selected by 200 μg/ml hygromycin B (Sigma). To analyze protein secretion, cells were maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum until confluency and switched to Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium containing 1% fetal bovine serum for 48 h. The conditioned medium was then collected and concentrated 50-fold using a Centricon-10 spin column before Western blotting. Immunocytochemistry—Cells were plated on precleaned coverslips, transfected, and then processed for immunocytochemistry. A live staining protocol was used to detect proteins on the cell surface, by which the transfected cells were incubated with primary antibody in the culture medium for 2 h at 4 °C. Cells were washed twice with PBS before fixation with 4% paraformaldehyde/PBS. After washing, cells were incubated with the appropriate secondary antibody in antibody dilution buffer (PBS, 0.1% Triton X-100, 20% goat serum) for 1 h at room temperature. Cells were then washed with PBS and mounted for fluorescent microscopy. Antibodies include anti-His tag (1:300, Clontech), anti-Myc (9E10, 1:400), goat anti-rabbit Cy2 (1:500, Molecular Probes), and goat anti-mouse Cy3 (1:500, Molecular Probes). Subcellular Fractionation—Stable QSulf-expressing 293T cell lines were grown on a 100-mm culture dish until confluency. After rinsing with PBS, cells were scraped from the plate and collected by centrifuging. Cell pellets were resuspended in 500 μl of hypotonic Tris buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4) and lysed by passing through a 27-gauge needle 40 times with the presence of protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science). The cell lysate was centrifuged for 5 min at 14,000 × g to remove the nucleus. The supernatant was separated into a soluble cytosol portion and an insoluble membrane-bound portion by centrifuging for 30 min at 100,000 × g. The insoluble membrane-bound portion was resuspended in a Triton cell lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 137 mm NaCl, 15% glycerol) and then further separated into a Triton-soluble portion and a Triton-insoluble portion by a second 30-min centrifugation at 100,000 × g. The Triton-insoluble portion was dissolved in SDS lysis buffer containing 0.5% SDS, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA. Western Blot Analysis—Proteins in cell extracts (20 μg), concentrated condition medium, or on anti-Myc-agarose beads were separated on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred to a Hybond-P membrane. The membrane was soaked in 5% nonfat dry milk in PBST (PBS + 0.1% Tween 20) for 1 h at room temperature to block unspecific binding of the antibody. The membrane was probed with the anti-His antibody (1:2000) for 2 h at room temperature, washed with PBST, and incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit secondary antibody (1: 5000, Jackson Immunolaboratories) for 1 h at room temperature. To detect the anti-Myc IgG on agarose beads, the blot was incubated directly with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse secondary antibody (1:5000; Jackson Immunolaboratories). The membrane was subsequently washed, and signals were detected by ECL (Amersham Biosciences). Purification of Heparan Sulfate from 293T Cells—[35S]GAGs were prepared by metabolically labeling 293T cells for 5 h in F12 medium containing 1% FBS and 100 μCi/ml 35SO4. Cells were subsequently lysed in hypotonic 0.25% Triton X-100 in H2O, and the cell lysate was digested with proteinase K (10 μg/ml) at 55 °C overnight to degrade proteins. After boiling for 10 min to inactivate proteinase K, cellular GAGs were precipitated with 3 volumes of 100% ethanol and 10 μgof dermatan sulfate at -20 °C. The precipitate was collected by centrifugation, washed with 70% ethanol, air-dried, and dissolved in H2O. GAGs were digested with 0.2 unit of chondroitinase ABC (Seikagaku) to degrade chondroitin sulfate followed by HS purification with a 5-KDa filter unit to remove low molecular mass degraded products. Heparan Sulfate Binding Assays—The QSulf2HD, QSulf2HDC, QSulf2HDS, and QSulf2HDΔC14 was transiently expressed in 293T cells and subsequently purified from cell lysates (500 μl) with 25 μl of anti-Myc beads. The truncated HD fragments migrated at the same position as anti-Myc antibody on a SDS-polyacrylamide gel, which made it difficult to assay the amounts of HD fragments on anti-Myc beads. Therefore, the cell lysate was in large excess to the binding sites on anti-Myc beads to guarantee the maximum binding of the expressed protein. After washing three times with PBS, the anti-Myc beads with bound QSulf2HD fragments were aliquotted into 10 μl and incubated with 5 μl of [35S]HS (∼2 × 104 cpm) at room temperature for 1 h. The anti-Myc beads were subsequently washed with ice-cold PBS, and the 35S radioactivity retained on the beads was quantified with Beckman scintillation counter. Sulfatase Enzymatic Assay—Stable QSulf-transfected 293T cells were lysed in hypotonic 0.25% Triton X-100 in H2O with protease inhibitor mixture. QSulf2 enzymes were purified with anti-Myc beads from the cell lysate. To strip Sulf protein from the cell surface, cells were rinsed with ice-cold PBS followed by 1 m NaCl for 5 s. QSulf enzymes present in high salt washes were concentrated 20-fold by centricon-1 and dialyzed in TBS buffer before the enzymatic assay. For the endosulfatase activity assay, 35SO4-labeled GAG substrate (10 μl) was digested by Sulf enzyme (50 μl) at 37 °C overnight in a 200-μl volume containing 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5) and 50 mm MgCl2. The released SO4 was collected by centrifuging the reaction at 14,000 rpm for 15 min using the 5-kDa filter unit, and the 35S radioactivity in the flow-through was subsequently quantified with Beckman scintillation counter. Structural Analysis of 35S-Labeled Cellular GAGs—HS disaccharides were generated by deaminative cleavage of 35S-labeled HS and subsequently resolved by HPLC anion exchange chromatography (20Rong J. Habuchi H. Kimata K. Lindahl U. Kusche-Gullberg M. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 5548-5555Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). To determine the disaccharide composition of chondroitin sulfate, purified 35S-labeled chondroitin sulfate chains were degraded by digestion with 0.1 unit of chondroitinase ABC (Seikagaku) in 40 μl of 0.05 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 0.03 m sodium acetate and 0.1 mg of bovine serum albumin. After incubation for 15 h at 37 °C, the digest was passed through a Superdex 30 (Amersham Biosciences) column, equilibrated with 0.5 m NH4HCO3. Disaccharides were recovered, freeze-dried, and fractionated further by descending paper chromatography conducted on Whatman No. 3MM paper in acetic acid/n-butanol/1 m ammonia (3:2:1, v/v). After 32 h, the paper strips were dried, cut into 1-cm segments, and analyzed for radioactivity by liquid scintillation counting. The radioactivity in each disaccharide product was calculated as the percentage of total radioactivity of HS or chondroitin sulfate. Preparation and Digestion of Extracellular Matrix (ECM) Coated on the Culture Plate—293T cells were metabolically labeled with 35SO4 for 5 h in a 24-well plate. Cells were lysed for 3 min at room temperature by incubating the cells with a PBS solution containing 0.5% Triton X-100, 20 mm NH4OH (21Nugent M.A. Edelman E.R. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 8876-8883Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 22Goerges A.L. Nugent M.A. J. Biol.

Cells were cultured overnight in the ECM-coated wells, and the medium was quantified for released 35S radioactivity from ECM. Characterization of QSulf2, a Second Member of the Avian Extracellular Endosulfatase Family—We cloned QSulf2 as a 4.36-kb cDNA by screening an embryonic quail cDNA library using the enzymatic domain of QSulf1 as a probe. QSulf2 is an 879 amino acid protein with a predicted molecular mass of 98 kDa. QSulf2, like other identified extracellular sulfatases, has four structural domains including an N-terminal signal peptide, an enzymatic domain, a hydrophilic domain, and a C-terminal domain (Fig. 1, A and B). The sequence comparison of QSulf2 to other extracellular sulfatases reveals extensive homology along the entire length of the protein (Fig. 1, A and C). The enzymatic domain of QSulf2 (red underline) is highly conserved across species and is 95% homologous to the enzymatic domain of QSulf1. Importantly, the enzymatic domain of QSulf2 includes two signature sequences, including an essential Cys residue in the catalytic site that is post-translationally converted to formylglycine for sulfatase enzymatic activity (Fig. 1A, red star). The hydrophilic domain (blue underline) of QSulf2 (QSulf2HD) shares an overall 86% homology with the HD domains of mammalian Sulf2 orthologues (Fig. 1A) and ∼60% homology with QSulf1HD (see Fig. 4A). The amino acid sequences at the N and C termini of the HD are largely conserved, suggesting the functional significance of these sequences. By contrast, the internal sequences within the hydrophilic domain (Fig. 1A, double blue underline) encoded by exons #10 and #11 in mouse and human Sulf genes (double blue underline), include the majority of the sequence divergence in vertebrate Sulf2 proteins (Fig. 1A) and also between Sulf1 and Sulf2 (Fig. 4A).FIGURE 4The hydrophilic domain of QSulf2 is required for cell surface association, HS binding, and the endosulfatase activity. A, the amino acid sequence alignment of QSulf1 HD and QSulf2 HD. The variable middle domain is shown with blue underline. Heparin-binding motifs were indicated by a solid upper line for QSulf1HD and dashed underline for QSulf2HD. The cluster of 14 basic amino acid residues is marked by a red underline. B, scheme of various deletions in QSulf2HD. C, Western blot analysis of the expression of HD, HDC, HDS, and HDΔC14. Most of the expressed polypeptides are present in the cell lysate, whereas the conditioned (con.) medium contained mostly degraded polypeptides. Ctrl, control. D, cell surface staining of QSulf2HD, HDC, HDS, and HDΔC14. 3T3 cells were transfected with pAG-N-Myc expression vector containing various HD sequences before cells were live-stained with anti-Myc antibody. QSulf2HD, HDC, and HDΔC14 associate extensively with the extracellular matrix, similar to the surface staining of QSulf2. In contrast, HDS showeda poor extracellular localization. E, GAG binding assay of HD, HDC, HDS, and HDΔC14. Purified QSulf2HD, HDC, HDS, and HDΔC14 were incubated with [35S]HS to allow binding. After washing, [35S]HS bound to the beads were quantified. QSulf2HD, HDC, and HDΔC14 bind to HS, whereas HDS binds poorly. Western blotting showed the anti-Myc IgG to control the amount of various HD proteins in HS binding. Data represent mean and S.D. of three independent experiments. F, QSulf2 with various deletions in the HD was tested for the endosulfatase activity on [35S]GAG substrate. Activity was expressed as the percentage of the full-length QSulf2. Deletion of the HD, HDC, or the cluster of 14-amino-acid residues eliminated the enzymatic activity, whereas deletion of the middle HDS only marginally decreased the enzymatic activity. Data represent the mean of three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) QSulf2 and QSulf1 Have Identical HS Substrate Specificities—To investigate QSulf2 substrate specificities, QSulf2 cloned into the pAG expression vector with a C-terminal Myc and His tag was expressed in a stably transfected 293T cell line. QSulf2 protein was affinity-purified using anti-Myc antibody conjugated to the agarose beads. Cellular [35S]GAG substrate was prepared by metabolically labeling 293T cells. After enzymatic digestion, QSulf2 and QSulf1 each released ∼5% 35S radioactivity from [35S]HS substrate, whereas control extracts prepared from cells transfected with empty vector or enzymatically inactive QSulf1(C-A) released background levels of 35S radioactivity (Fig. 2A), consistent with their activities as endosulfatases (16Ai X. Do A. Lozynska O. Kusche-Gullberg M. Lindahl U. Emerson Jr., C.P. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 162: 341-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). QSulf2, like QSulf1, also was inactive on N-acetylglucosamine 6-O-sulfate monosaccharide substrate (data not shown), further supporting the conclusion that QSulf2 is an HS endosulfatase. To investigate QSulf2 substrate specificity, QSulf2-digested cellular [35S]HS were subjected to disaccharide compositional analysis by deaminative cleavage followed by HPLC (20Rong J. Habuchi H. Kimata K. Lindahl U. Kusche-Gullberg M. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 5548-5555Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Four major [35S]disaccharide products were resolved, including GlcA-GlcNS6S, IdoA-GlcNS6S, IdoA2S-GlcNS, and IdoA2S-GlcNS6S (Table 1). Each disaccharide was quantified by measuring the retained 35S radioactivity, expressed as the percentage of total 35S radioactivity of all four disaccharides. QSulf2 primarily removes 6-O-sulfates from trisulfated IdoA2S-GlcNS6S, as reflected in a decrease of IdoA2S-GlcNS6S, from 36.4 to 26.6% and a parallel increase of IdoA2S-GlcNS, from 48.8 to 59.6%. QSulf2 activity was inactive on chondroitin sulfate-derived substrates (Table 1). Therefore, QSulf2, like QSulf1, is an HS-specific 6-O-endosulfatase with substrate specificity for a subset of trisulfated disaccharide residues within the HS chains.TABLE 1Effects of QSulf2 on 35S-labeled cellular GAGs Purified QSulf2 on anti-Myc-agarose beads or empty vector-transfected control was incubated with [35S]GAGs overnight to allow exhaustive digestion. [35S]HS was degraded to disaccharides by deamination, and the products were reduced by NaBH4 and subsequently resolved by anion-exchange HPLC (14Lai J. Chien J. Staub J. Avula R. Greene E.L.

To explore the physiological functions of a neutral ceramidase with diverse cellular locations, we disrupted the Asah2 gene in mice. Asah2 null mice have a normal life span and do not show obvious abnormalities or major alterations in total ceramide levels in tissues. The Asah2-encoded neutral ceramidase is highly expressed in the small intestine along the brush border, suggesting that the neutral ceramidase may be involved in a pathway for the digestion of dietary sphingolipids.

Complex sphingolipids such as sphingomyelin and glycosphingolipids are abundant plasma membrane constituents in plant and animal cells. Here they function as organizers of membrane structure, regulators of cell signaling, and mediators of cell-cell interactions. Simple sphingolipid metabolites that can be derived by the degradation of the complex sphingolipids, including ceramide, sphingosine, and sphingosine 1-phosphate, fulfill a different role as signaling molecules. These simple sphingolipids utilize both intracellular and extracellular targets and are potent regulators of cell growth and survival. In the sphingolipid degradative pathway, ceramidases (EC 3.5.1.23) catalyze the hydrolysis of the N-acyl group of ceramide to yield sphingosine and fatty acids. Sphingosine can then be phosphorylated by sphingosine kinase to yield sphingosine 1-phosphate. Thus, ceramidases are key regulators of sphingolipid signaling metabolites. Ceramidases have traditionally been classified according to the pH range (acid, neutral, or alkaline) that supports their optimal activity. Recently, the mammalian ceramidases have been defined more precisely by genetic and structural means, which has revealed at least four distinct enzymes. An acid ceramidase is encoded by the Asah1 gene (3Koch J. Gartner S. Li C.M. Quintern L.E. Bernardo K. Levran O. Schnabel D. Desnick R.J. Schuchman E.H. Sandhoff K. J. Biol.

The neutral ceramidase has been identified as a type II integral membrane protein that can be cleaved to yield a soluble secreted protein (17Tani M. Iida H. Ito M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 10523-10530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Interestingly, a shortened human neutral ceramidase truncated at the amino terminus was shown to localize to mitochondria (12El Bawab S. Roddy P. Qian T. Bielawska A. Lemasters J.J. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21508-21513Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). The enzyme has also been demonstrated in the apical membranes of proximal and distal tubules, collecting ducts of kidney, endosome-like organelles of hepatocytes (13Mitsutake S. Tani M. Okino N.

To identify the physiologic functions of this neutral ceramidase in mice, we inactivated the Asah2 gene by homologous recombination. We found that Asah2 null mice are viable and appear without severe defects. However, the Asah2 null mice are impaired in the intestinal degradation of sphingolipids, a process that has been reported to alter susceptibility to intestinal tumorigenesis (19Schmelz E.M. Front.

Our findings indicate that an essential physiologic function of the neutral ceramidase is for the metabolism of dietary sphingolipids and, thus, the regulation of bioactive ceramide and sphingosine levels in the gastrointestinal tract. Preparation of Polyclonal Antibody—A rabbit anti-mouse neutral ceramidase antibody (Ab174) was raised against the peptide corresponding to amino acids 741–756 of mouse neutral ceramidase (CILAFEGISSPFEVVTT). The peptide was conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin as a carrier and injected into rabbits. The specific antibody was isolated by affinity purification from immune serum using the peptide antigen. Generation of Asah2 Null Mice—To construct the Asah2 targeting vector, a 4.8-kbp cassette containing the neomycin-resistance gene (25Nehls M. Kyewski B. Messerle M. Waldschutz R. Schuddekopf K. Smith A.J. Boehm T. Science. 1996; 272: 886-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar) was inserted between a BamHI and a MluI sites in the same orientation as the Asah2 gene (Fig. 1). Gene targeting in TC1 embryonic stem (ES) 2The abbreviations used are: ES, embryonic stem; NBD, [(7-nitro-2-1,3-benzoxadiazol-4-yl)amino]; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; IS, internal standard; WT, wild type; bis-Tris, 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diol. cells and generation of chimeric and heterozygous mice were performed as described previously (26Liu Y. Wada R. Kawai H. Sango K. Deng C. Tai T. McDonald M.P. Araujo K. Crawley J.N. Bierfreund U. Sandhoff K. Suzuki K. Proia R.L. J. Clin. Investig. 1999; 103: 497-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). One targeted ES clone was used to establish chimeric mice, which were crossed with C57BL/6 mice to obtain Asah2 heterozygous mice. The heterozygous mice were crossed with C57BL/6 mice, and mice back-crossed to the fifth generation were used for experiments. The Asah2 genotypes were determined by Southern blot analysis and PCR. For PCR genotyping, three primers (Fig. 1) were used: 5′ACAGGACACCCAACTCCATTCCTT3′ (primer 1), 5′TGAGTGCCTGGAAGAAGATGGGAA3′ (primer 2), and 5′ATCGCCTTCTATCGCCTTCTTGAC3′ (primer 3). Primers 1 and 2 detected the wild-type Asah2 allele and amplified an ∼280-bp fragment. Primers 2 and 3 detected the Asah2 neo allele and amplified an ∼390-bp fragment. Forty cycles of 94 °C (30 s), 55 °C (30 s), and 72 °C (1 min) were used. Northern Analysis—Total RNA was prepared from mouse liver and kidney using TRIzol® reagent (Invitrogen). Total RNA (50 μg) was fractionated on denaturing formaldehyde-agarose gels (1%) and then transferred to positively charged nylon membranes (GeneScreen Plus; PerkinElmer Life Sciences and Analytical Science). The membranes were prehybridized in PerfectHyb Plus (Sigma-Aldrich) with 0.1 mg/ml denatured salmon sperm DNA at 68 °C for 1 h. Hybridization was performed at 68 °C overnight with 32P-labeled DNA probe prepared by the random priming method. Asah2 cDNA was used as a probe. The membranes were washed in 2× SSC (sodium chloride/sodium citrate buffer), 0.1% SDS at 25 °C for 5 min and in 0.2× SSC, 0.1% SDS at 50 °C for 5 min, 55 °C for 5 min, 60 °C for 5 min, and 65 °C for 5 min. Radiolabeled bands were detected using a BAS-2500 radioimage analyzer (Fujifilm). Real-time PCR—Regional dissection of the intestinal tract was accomplished as described (27Sweetser D.A. Birkenmeier E.H. Hoppe P.C. McKeel D.W. Gordon J.I. Genes Dev. 1988; 2: 1318-1332Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). cDNA was synthesized from 1 μg of total RNA. Real-time PCR was performed using an ABI PRISM 7700 sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems) as described previously (28Wada R. Tifft C.J. Proia R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 10954-10959Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). Assay-on-Demand™ gene expression products for Asah2, Sphk1, Sphk2, Sgpp1, Sgpl1, Enpp5, and TaqMan Universal PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) were used for real-time PCR. For quantitation, Gapdh was amplified simultaneously. Assay of Ceramidase Activity—The neutral ceramidase activity was measured as described previously using NBD C12-ceramide (Avanti Polar Lipids Inc.) and palmitoyl-d-[erythro-9,10,-3H]sphingosine (American Radiolabeled Chemicals, Inc.) as the substrates with slight modification (29Tani M. Okino N. Mitsutake S. Tanigawa T. Izu H. Ito M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3462-3468Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Small intestine, brain, liver, and kidney were harvested after mice were fasted for 18 h. Regional dissection of the intestinal tract was accomplished as described (27Sweetser D.A. Birkenmeier E.H. Hoppe P.C. McKeel D.W. Gordon J.I. Genes Dev. 1988; 2: 1318-1332Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Mucosa was obtained by cutting the entire small intestine longitudinally and scraping the mucosa off with a glass slide. Mucosa, brain, liver, and kidney were homogenized in buffer A (1 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.32 m sucrose, and protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma-Aldrich)) and centrifuged at 10,000 × g at 4 °C for 30 min. The pellet was resuspended in buffer A, and 50 μg of homogenate protein was incubated in 20 μl of reaction buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1% sodium cholate, and 50 μm NBD C12-ceramide or 50 μm palmitoyl-d-erythro-sphingosine (1 μCi of palmitoyl-d-[erythro-9,10,-3H]sphingosine) at 37 °C for 10 min. The reaction was terminated by the addition of 100 μl of chloroform/methanol (2/1, v/v). This solution was dried in a SpeedVac concentrator, dissolved in 30 μl of chloroform/methanol (2/1, v/v), and applied onto TLC plates (silica gel 60, Merck). The TLC was developed with chloroform/methanol/2.5 n ammonia (90/20/0.5, v/v). Ceramide and fatty acid were separated by TLC and quantitated using a luminescent image analyzer (LAS-1000 plus, Fujifilm) or a BAS-2500 radioimage analyzer (Fujifilm). Degradation of sphingomyelin was measured using 50 μm NBD C12-sphingomyelin (Avanti Polar Lipids Inc.) as the substrate. The homogenates were prepared as described above, and 50 μg of homogenate protein was incubated in 20 μl of reaction buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1% sodium cholate, and 50 μm NBD C12-sphingomyelin) at 37 °C for various times. The reaction was terminated by the addition of 100 μl of chloroform/methanol (2/1, v/v). This solution was dried in a SpeedVac concentrator, dissolved in 30 μl of chloroform/methanol (2/1, v/v), and applied onto TLC plates (silica gel 60, Merck). The TLC was developed with chloroform/methanol/2.5 n ammonia (60/35/8, v/v). NBD C12-ceramide and NBD C12 fatty acid, the enzyme reaction products, were separated from NBD C12-sphingomyelin by TLC, and band intensity was measured using a luminescent image analyzer (LAS-1000 plus, Fujifilm). The amount of NBD C12 fatty acid, NBD C12-ceramide, and NBD C12-sphingomyelin were quantitated using a standard curve. Ceramide Digestion in Vitro—The capacity of intestinal segments to degrade NBD ceramide was accomplished by a method similar to that described by Schmelz et al. (23Schmelz E.M. Roberts P.C. Kustin E.M. Lemonnier L.A. Sullards M.C. Dillehay D.L. Merrill Jr., A.H. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 6723-6729PubMed Google Scholar). Small intestine was harvested after mice were fasted for 18 h. Regional dissection of the intestinal tract was accomplished as described (27Sweetser D.A. Birkenmeier E.H. Hoppe P.C. McKeel D.W. Gordon J.I. Genes Dev. 1988; 2: 1318-1332Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), and 2-cm segments were cut off from the middle of the respective intestinal regions. Each segment was opened longitudinally, rinsed with cold PBS, and incubated in 200 μl of reaction buffer (PBS, 0.017% sodium cholate, and 20 μm NBD C12-ceramide) at 37 °C. After various incubation times, the reaction mixture was transferred to a glass tube that was placed on ice. Residual intestinal segments were washed with 200 μl of PBS, and the buffer was combined with the reaction mixture. Another 200 μl of PBS was added to intestinal segments. One ml of chloroform/methanol/hydrochloric acid (100:100:1, v/v) and 200 μl of 1 m sodium chloride were added to both fractions of the reaction mixture and the intestinal segment, mixed vigorously, and centrifuged at 2,000 × g for 10 min. The organic phase of the solution was collected, evaporated under nitrogen gas, and dissolved in 100 μl of chloroform/methanol (1:1, v/v), and 10 μl was applied onto TLC plates (silica gel 60, Merck). TLC was developed with chloroform/methanol/2.5 n ammonia (90/20/0.5, v/v) and visualized using a luminescent image analyzer (LAS-1000 plus, Fujifilm). Liquid Chromatography/Tandem Mass Spectrometry Analysis of Sphingolipids—Sphingolipid levels were determined in extracts of major tissues (brain, lung, heart, thymus, spleen, kidney, liver, and skeletal muscle and in the gastrointestinal tract, excluding luminal contents) and in the serum of Asah2 null and wild-type mice. Gastrointestinal tract tissues were harvested after fasting the mice for 18 h. Regional dissection of the intestinal tract was accomplished as described (27Sweetser D.A. Birkenmeier E.H. Hoppe P.C. McKeel D.W. Gordon J.I. Genes Dev. 1988; 2: 1318-1332Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Each intestinal segment was opened longitudinally and rinsed with cold PBS. Electrospray ionization/tandem mass spectrometry analysis of endogenous sphingosine, sphingoid base-1-phosphates and ceramide species were performed on a Thermo Finnigan TSQ 7000 triple quadrupole mass spectrometer, operating in a multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) positive ionization mode, using a modified version (30Bielawski J. Szulc Z.M. Hannun Y.A. Bielawska A. Methods. 2006; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar) of a published protocol (31Sullards M.C. Merrill Jr., A.H. Sci. STKE 2001. 2001; (67/PL1)Google Scholar). Briefly, the biological materials were fortified with internal standards (C17 base d-erythro-sphingosine, C17 sphingosine 1-phosphate, N-palmitoyl-d-erythro-C13-sphingosine, and heptadecanoyl-d-erythro-sphingosine and C6-phytoceramide), then extracted with ethyl acetate/iso-propanol/water (60/30/10, v/v) solvent system. After evaporation and reconstitution in 150 μl of methanol, samples were injected on the Surveyor/TSQ 7000 LC/MS system and gradient-eluted from the BDS Hypersil C8, 150 × 3.2 mm, 3-μm particle size column, with a 1.0 mm methanolic ammonium formate/2 mm aqueous ammonium formate mobile phase system. Peaks corresponding to the target analytes and internal standards (ISs) were collected and processed using the Xcalibur software system. Quantitative analysis was based on the calibration curves generated by spiking an artificial matrix with the known amounts of the target analyte synthetic standards and an equal amount of the ISs. The target analyte/IS peak areas ratios were plotted against analyte concentration. The target analyte/IS peak area ratios from the samples were similarly normalized to their respective ISs and compared with the calibration curves, using a linear regression model. Introduction of the internal standards to the samples prior to extraction yielded results already “recovery-corrected”; therefore, no further data manipulations were necessary. Western Blot Analysis—Stomach, duodenum, jejunum, ileum, cecum, and colon were homogenized in buffer A and centrifuged at 10,000 × g at 4 °C for 30 min. The pellet was resuspended in buffer A. Ten μg of protein was incubated in NuPAGE™ sample buffer with reducing agent (Invitrogen) at 70 °C for 10 min, loaded onto a NuPAGE™ 4–12% bis-Tris gel (Invitrogen), and blotted onto nylon membrane (Invitrogen). The nylon blot was blocked by immersion in Odyssey blocking buffer (LI-COR Bioscience) at room temperature for 1 h before incubation at 4 °C overnight with anti-neutral ceramidase antibody (Ab174, 1 μg/ml) and an anti-β-actin monoclonal antibody (A5441, 1:5000 dilution, Sigma-Aldrich). After washing with 0.1% Tween 20 containing PBS for four times (5 min per wash), the membrane was incubated with Alexa Fluor 680 goat anti-mouse IgG (H+L) (0.4 μg/ml, Molecular Probes) and IRDye 800-conjugated affinity-purified goat anti-rabbit IgG Fc (1:5000 dilution, Rockland Immunochemicals for Research) at room temperature for 1 h. After washing with 0.1% Tween 20 containing PBS for four times (5 min per wash), and with PBS once (5 min per wash), immunoreactivity was detected using an Odyssey infrared system (LI-COR Bioscience). Histological Analysis—Small intestine and cecum were harvested after fasting mice for 18 h. Small intestine was rolled tightly on No. 3MM chromatography paper (Whatman) soaked in PFA (4% paraformaldehyde in 100 mm phosphate buffer). The rolled small intestine and cecum, kept separately in histology cassettes with foam pads, were soaked in PFA at 4 °C overnight. The cassettes were transferred to 30% sucrose in PBS and kept at 4 °C overnight. The small intestine and cecum were removed from cassettes and embedded in OCT compound (Sakura Finetechnical Co., Ltd., Tokyo). Serial sections (5-μm thick) were stained with hematoxylin and eosin. For immunostaining, the specimens were fixed in PFA at 4 °C for 15 min, and antigen retrieval was accomplished by a 30-min incubation at 95 °C in Target retrieval solution (DAKO Corp.). Endogenous peroxidase activity was quenched by incubation with 0.3% hydrogen peroxide in methanol for 5 min. After rinsing with TBST (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 300 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20), blocking was performed by a 20-min incubation in CAS-BLOCK (Zymed Laboratories Inc.). The specimens were incubated with anti-neutral ceramidase antibody (Ab174; 5 μg/ml) at room temperature for 1 h followed by a 20-min incubation in horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (1 μg/ml; Upstate) after rinsing with TBST. The neutral ceramidase expression was visualized using a peroxidase substrate kit (Vector Laboratories Inc.). Detection of Ceramide in Feces—Asah2 null and wild-type mice were maintained on a AIN-76A diet supplemented with 0.1% (w/w) milk sphingomyelin (Avanti Polar Lipids, catalog No. 860063) or on a AIN-76A diet alone. After 1 week of feeding, feces were collected during a 1-h period and dried. Total lipids were extracted from 25 mg of feces (dry weight) with 2 ml of chloroform/methanol (1:1, v/v). Organic and aqueous phases were separated by adding 1 ml of water and centrifugation at 2,000 × g for 10 min. An aliquot of organic phase was transferred to a glass tube, dried under nitrogen gas, and dissolved as micelles by brief sonication in 40 μl of 10 mm imidazole (pH 6.6), 7.5% octyl-β-d-glucopyronoside, 5 mm cardiolipin, and 0.2 mm diethylenetramine-pentaacetic acid (Sigma). 140 μl of reaction buffer (100 mm imidazole, pH 6.6, 100 mm NaCl, 25 mm MgCl2, 2 mm EGTA, 10 mm dithiothreitol, and 10 milliunits of Escherichia coli diacylglycerol kinase) was added to lipid micelles, and reaction was initiated by adding 20 μl of [γ-32P]ATP (10 μCi, 10 mm ATP, 200 mm MgCl2). After incubation at room temperature for 1 h, lipids were fractionated in the organic phase by adding 0.5 ml of chloroform/methanol/hydrochloric acid (100:100:1, v/v) and 100 μl of 1 m sodium chloride followed by centrifugation. An aliquot of organic phase was applied onto TLC plates (silica gel 60, Merck). The TLC was developed with the solvent chloroform/methanol/acetone/acetic acid/water (10:3:4:2:1, v/v) and analyzed with a BAS-2500 radioimage analyzer (Fujifilm). Generation of Asah2 Mutant Mice—The mouse Asah2 gene spans more than 70 kbp and consists of 27 exons and 26 introns (10Okino N. Mori K. Ito M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 299: 160-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 11Choi M.S. Anderson M.A. Zhang Z. Zimonjic D.B. Popescu N. Mukherjee A.B. Gene (Amst.). 2003; 315: 113-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). An Asah2 targeting vector was constructed to produce a deletion of a portion of exon 17 and the entire exon 18 (Fig. 1A). Southern blot analysis of KpnI-digested genomic DNA from properly targeted ES cells yielded a >20-kbp band, corresponding to the Asah2 wild-type allele, and a 8-kbp band corresponding to the recombined Asah2 allele (Fig. 1, A and B). A targeted ES clone was used to produce chimeras and subsequently heterozygous mice. Interbreeding of the Asah2 heterozygous mice yielded wild-type, heterozygous, and homozygous mutant (null) offspring (Fig. 1C) at approximately Mendelian ratios (wild type:heterozygote:homozygote mutant = 151:319:153), demonstrating the absence of significant embryonic lethality in the mutant mice. Intercrossing of the Asah2 homozygous mutant mice produced Asah2 homozygous mutant offspring, indicating that fertility of males and females was largely unaffected. The Asah2 null mice grew normally, did not exhibit obvious abnormalities, and were viable for up to 1 year. A histological evaluation of major organs and tissues did not reveal unusual pathology. Asah2 Expression—To confirm the absence of Asah2 transcripts in Asah2 null mice, Northern blot analysis was performed using total RNA from liver and kidney (Fig. 1D). In Asah2 null tissues, the Asah2 6.0-kb transcript was not detected, whereas wild-type and heterozygous mice expressed the Asah2 transcript in a gene dosage-dependent manner (Fig. 1D). In agreement with a previous report (11Choi M.S. Anderson M.A. Zhang Z. Zimonjic D.B. Popescu N. Mukherjee A.B. Gene (Amst.). 2003; 315: 113-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), in normal mice the Asah2 gene was found to be highly expressed in small intestine when compared with expression levels in the brain, liver, and other portions of the gastrointestinal tract, including stomach, cecum, and colon (Fig. 2A). Correspondingly, in normal (wild-type) mice, neutral ceramidase activity was highly elevated in small intestinal mucosa compared with extracts of brain, liver, and kidney (Fig. 2B). Neutral ceramidase activity was not detectable in Asah2 null tissues, confirming the functional disruption of the Asah2 gene (Fig. 2B). Similar results were obtained using 3H-C16-ceramide as a substrate (data not shown; specific activities in wild-type small intestinal mucosa: NBD C12-ceramide, 50.7 ± 11.4 nmol/h/mg protein; 3H-C16-ceramide, 12.6 ± 0.17 nmol/h/mg protein). Western blot analysis using an anti-neutral ceramidase antibody (Ab174) demonstrated the expression of an ∼115 kDa major band and an ∼100 kDa minor band in duodenum, jejunum, and ileum of wild-type mice, with the strongest signal in the jejunum (Fig. 3A). No immunoreactive bands were detected in tissues from the Asah2 null mice. Immunostaining localized the neutral ceramidase to the epithelial mucosa in jejunum and ileum in wild-type mice (Fig. 3B; ileum data not shown). The Asah2 null tissues showed no expression of the neutral ceramidase (Fig. 3B). Sphingolipid Levels—Sphingolipid levels, including total and individual ceramide species, sphingosine, and sphingosine 1-phosphate, were determined in major tissues (brain, lung, heart, thymus, spleen, kidney, liver, skeletal muscle, and serum) and in gastrointestinal tract tissues of Asah2 null and wild-type mice by mass spectrometry analysis. With the exception of the intestinal tract tissues, sphingolipid levels were similar in wild-type and Asah2 null mice (Fig. 4, data not shown). In jejunum, the level of C16:0 ceramide (the major species of ceramide in the gastrointestinal tract tissues) was significantly increased in Asah2 null mice when compared with wild type (Fig. 4A). The level of total ceramide (Fig. 4B), however, was not significantly different in wild-type versus Asah2 null mice in intestinal tissues. Phytoceramide levels were not elevated in tissues of the gastrointestinal tract (data not shown). Levels of sphingosine, a product of the ceramidase reaction, were significantly decreased in jejunum and colon of Asah2 null mice when compared with those of wild-type mice (Fig. 4C). Phytosphingosine in Asah2 null jejunum, ileum, and cecum was also depressed compared with wild-type tissues (jejunum: wild type (WT), 8.20 ± 3.26 versus Asah2 null, 6.75 ± 1.35, p = 0.0087; ileum: WT, 14.67 ± 4.40 versus Asah2 null, 4.47 ± 0.24, p = 0.0814"
https://openalex.org/W2089919670,"Alterations in cardiac G protein-mediated signaling, most prominently Gq/11 signaling, are centrally involved in hypertrophy and heart failure development. Several RGS proteins that can act as negative regulators of G protein signaling are expressed in the heart, but their functional roles are still poorly understood. RGS expression changes have been described in hypertrophic and failing hearts. In this study, we report a marked decrease in RGS2 (but not other major cardiac RGS proteins (RGS3-RGS5)) that occurs prior to hypertrophy development in different models with enhanced Gq/11 signaling (transgenic expression of activated Gαq* and pressure overload due to aortic constriction). To assess functional consequences of selective down-regulation of endogenous RGS2, we identified targeting sequences for effective RGS2 RNA interference and used lipid-based transfection to achieve uptake of fluorescently labeled RGS2 small interfering RNA in >90% of neonatal and adult ventricular myocytes. Endogenous RGS2 expression was dose-dependently suppressed (up to 90%) with no major change in RGS3-RGS5. RGS2 knockdown increased phenylephrine- and endothelin-1-induced phospholipase Cβ stimulation in both cell types and exacerbated the hypertrophic effect (increase in cell size and radiolabeled protein) in neonatal myocytes, with no major change in Gq/11-mediated ERK1/2, p38, or JNK activation. Taken together, this study demonstrates that endogenous RGS2 exerts functionally important inhibitory restraint on Gq/11-mediated phospholipase Cβ activation and hypertrophy in ventricular myocytes. Our findings point toward a potential pathophysiological role of loss of fine tuning due to selective RGS2 down-regulation in Gq/11-mediated remodeling.

Many different stimuli and signaling pathways have been implicated in hypertrophy development (1Frey N. Olson E.N. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2003; 65: 45-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (1193) Google Scholar). Among them, signaling events that are mediated by heterotrimeric Gq/11 proteins are of central importance (2Dorn II, G.W. Hahn H.S. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2004; 1015: 225-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Gq/11 proteins are members of a protein family that transduces signals from many different G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) 3The abbreviations used are: GPCR, G protein-coupled receptor; RNAi, RNA interference; ANF, atrial natriuretic factor; KO, knock-out; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; RT, reverse transcription; shRNA, short hairpin RNA; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; NVM, neonatal ventricular myocyte(s); AVM, adult ventricular myocyte(s); PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PE, phenylephrine; Tim, timolol; ET-1, endothelin-1; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; JNK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase; PLC, phospholipase C. to generate diverse effects on myocyte growth, contractility, and heart rate (3Offermanns S. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 2003; 83: 101-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). G proteins are subject to direct regulation by RGS (Regulators of G protein Signaling) proteins, which shorten the duration of the cellular response to external signals and generally cause a reduction in hormone sensitivity (4Hollinger S. Hepler J.R. Pharmacol. Rev. 2002; 54: 527-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar). Whereas their primary mode of action is acceleration of signal termination by decreasing the lifetime of active, GTP-bound Gα subunits, some RGS can also block signal generation by antagonizing Gα-mediated effector activation (5Anger T. Zhang W. Mende U. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 276: 3906-3915Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Thus, RGS proteins are believed to play an important role in fine tuning GPCR-induced signal transduction. Several RGS proteins are expressed in the heart, but their exact roles in the normal and diseased heart are still poorly defined (6Riddle E.L. Schwartzman R.A. Bond M. Insel P.A. Circ. Res. 2005; 96: 401-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Most cardiac RGS proteins belong to the B/R4 family of “small” RGS proteins that primarily consist of the Gα-binding RGS homology domain and short extensions (7Ross E.M. Wilkie T.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 795-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (937) Google Scholar). They are mostly nondiscriminatory toward members of the Gq/11 and Gi/o subfamilies in vitro but tend to display greater specificity in intact cells (8De Vries L. Zheng B. Fischer T. Elenko E. Farquhar M.G. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2000; 40: 235-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar). Myocardial expression studies to date have been restricted to a few RGS proteins and hearts that were already hypertrophic and/or failing (9Mittmann C. Chung C.H. Hoppner G. Michalek C. Nose M. Schuler C. Schuh A. Eschenhagen T. Weil J. Pieske B. Hirt S. Wieland T. Cardiovasc. Res. 2002; 55: 778-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 10Owen V.J. Burton P.B. Mullen A.J. Birks E.J.

Cardiol. 1998; 30: 269-276Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). At that stage, a multitude of signaling changes occur, many of which are probably secondary to the remodeling process. The first goal of the present study was to test the hypothesis that changes in the ventricular amount of Gq/11-regulating RGS proteins may precede hypertrophic remodeling and could therefore potentially be of pathophysiological significance. An increase in Gq/11-regulating RGS protein(s) would be expected to attenuate Gq/11 signaling and could thereby blunt or delay Gq/11-mediated hypertrophy, whereas conversely a decrease in RGS could exacerbate Gq/11 signaling and have a deleterious effect. We focused on RGS proteins that have been consistently detected in cardiac tissue (9Mittmann C. Chung C.H. Hoppner G. Michalek C. Nose M. Schuler C. Schuh A. Eschenhagen T. Weil J. Pieske B. Hirt S.

Acta. 2001; 1522: 97-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 13Kardestuncer T. Wu H. Lim A.L. Neer E.J. FEBS Lett. 1998; 438: 285-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), namely RGS2, RGS3, RGS4, and RGS5. Since RGS16 has been reported to be highly inducible in cardiac myocytes (13Kardestuncer T. Wu H. Lim A.L. Neer E.J. FEBS Lett. 1998; 438: 285-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), it was also included in this analysis. RGS mRNA expression was examined in two different models with enhanced Gq/11 signaling: (i) transgenic mice expressing constitutively active GαqQ209L (Gαq*) (14Mende U. Kagen A. Cohen A. Aramburu J. Schoen F.J. Neer E.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13893-13898Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar), in which enhanced Gαq signaling is restricted to myocytes until remodeling eventually affects signaling in nonmyocytes as well, and (ii) pressure overload hypertrophy in response to aortic banding, because its dependence on Gq/11 signaling is well recognized (15Akhter S.A. Luttrell L.M. Rockman H.A. Iaccarino G. Lefkowitz R.J. Koch W.J. Science. 1998; 280: 574-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar, 16Wettschureck N. Rutten H. Zywietz A. Gehring D. Wilkie T.M. Chen J. Chien K.R. Offermanns S. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 1236-1240Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). Importantly, in contrast to existing studies, we examined RGS expression over time, with a special focus on changes that occur early on, and observed a selective reduction in RGS2 protein and mRNA expression in both models prior to hypertrophy initiation. In the second part of the study, we tested the hypothesis that endogenous RGS2 inhibits Gq/11-mediated signaling and hypertrophy in cardiac myocytes and determined whether or not selective RGS2 knock-down has functional implications despite the presence of other RGS proteins with potentially overlapping function. In order to achieve that goal, we identified targeting sequences that allowed for effective and selective RNA interference (RNAi) of endogenous RGS2 and established experimental conditions for RNAi in cultured cardiac myocytes. RNAi has evolved in recent years as a powerful approach to decode gene function of endogenous proteins. It describes a phenomenon by which double-stranded RNA induces potent and specific inhibition of eukaryotic gene expression via the degradation of complementary mRNA (17Hannon G.J. Rossi J.J. Nature. 2004; 431: 371-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (973) Google Scholar, 18Dykxhoorn D.M. Novina C.D. Sharp P.A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 4: 457-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (1024) Google Scholar). In Vivo Models of Hypertrophy—The generation and respective phenotypes of two independent transgenic mouse lines with heart-specific expression of constitutively active Gαq* have been described elsewhere (14Mende U. Kagen A. Cohen A. Aramburu J. Schoen F.J. Neer E.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13893-13898Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar, 19Mende U. Kagen A. Meister M. Neer E.J. Circ.

Cell Cardiol. 2000; 33: 1477-1491Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Pressure overload was induced by ascending aortic constriction in 2.5-month-old FVB mice for 8 weeks as described (21Liao R. Jain M. Cui L. D'Agostino J. Aiello F. Luptak I. Ngoy S. Mortensen R.M. Tian R. Circulation. 2002; 106: 2125-2131Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). All experimental protocols were reviewed and approved by the institutional animal care and use committee. Additional information on RGS expression in response to pressure overload hypertrophy due to ascending aortic constriction was obtained. 4Genomics of Cardiovascular Development, Adaptation, and Remodeling: NHLBI Program for Genomic Applications, Harvard Medical School, available on the World Wide Web at www.cardiogenomics.org. Northern Blot Analysis—Total ventricular RNA (RNAzol B; TelTest) was extracted from mouse ventricular tissue, size-fractionated (10 μg/lane), and transferred to nylon membranes that were incubated with 32P-labeled cRNA probes (Strip-EZTM SP6/T7; Ambion) for RGS2, RGS4, and RGS5, random-primed 32P-labeled (Prime-It®II; Stratagene) ANF and GAPDH cDNA probes, and an 18 S oligonucleotide probe that had been labeled with [γ-32P]ATP by T4 polynucleotide kinase (Gibco). The RGS mRNA transcripts sizes were 1.5/1.8 kb (RGS2), 3.3 kb (RGS4), and 4.4 kb (RGS5) with no other bands detectable. Blots were exposed to x-ray film followed by quantitative densitometry. Data were normalized to GAPDH or 18 S rRNA. Reverse Transcription (RT) PCR—Total RNA (1 μg) extracted from ventricular tissue or myocytes of Gαq*-expressing and aortic banded mice was reverse transcribed (Thermo-Script™ RT; Invitrogen) and amplified (HotStarTaq DNA Polymerase™; Qiagen) with primers specific for mouse RGS2-RGS5 and GAPDH (RGS2(F), CTGAGAATGCAAAGTGCCATGTTCCTGGCT; RGS2(R), GGTCTCATGTAGCATGGGGCTCCGTGGTGA; RGS3(F), GCCTCTGACACCACCTTACACTGCTCTGAT; RGS3(R), CTAGGGACCACCAGTATCCAGCTCAGCGTT; RGS4(F), CAGAAGTCAGATTCCTGCGAACACAGTTC; RGS4(R), TGTGTGAGAATTAGGCACACTGGGAGACCA; RGS5(F), ATCAAGATCAAGTTGGGAATTCTCCTCCAG; RGS5(R), GCTCCTTATAAAATTCAGAGCGCACAAAGC; GAPDH (F), ATGGTGAAGGTCGGTGTGAACGGATTTGGC; GAPDH(R), AGGTCCACCACCCTGTTGCTGTAGCCGTAT. Quantitative densitometry was performed on ethidium bromide-stained agarose gels. Respective transcript sizes were 645 bp (RGS2), 752 bp (RGS3), 546 bp (RGS4), 480 bp (RGS5), 973 bp (GAPDH). RT-PCR in RGS2-silenced rat cardiomyocytes was performed on total RNA (RNeasy Mini Kit; Qiagen), using the Superscript One-step RT-PCR kit (Invitrogen) with the following primers: RGS2(F), ATGCAAAGTGCCATGTTCCTGG; RGS2(R), TCATGTAGCATGGGGCTCCG; RGS3(F), CTGGAAAAGCTGCTGCTTCATA; RGS3(R), GACTCATCTTCTTCTGGTTAATG; RGS4(F), ATGTGCAAAGGACTCGCTGGT; RGS4(R), TCAGGCACACTGAGGGACTAGG; RGS5(F), GGAAAGGGCCAAAGAGATCAAG; RGS5(R), CTCCTTATAAAACTCAGAGCGC; GAPDH(F), AGTGGATATTGTTGCCATCAATG; GAPDH(R), CCATGAGGTCCACCACCCTG. Respective transcript sizes were 636 bp (RGS2), 345 bp (RGS3), 618 bp (RGS4), 496 bp (RGS5), and 830 bp (GAPDH). Real Time PCR—Reverse transcribed (TaqMan Reverse Transcription Reagents; Applied Biosystems) RNA samples from neonatal and adult rat ventricular myocytes (Trizol; Invitrogen) were subjected to PCR using FAM™-labeled Taqman® MGB probes for RGS2-RGS5 and 18 S and TaqMan® Universal PCR master mix (Applied Biosystems) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Each sample was assayed in two independent RT reactions and duplicate reactions each and normalized to 18 S expression. Negative controls included the absence of enzyme in the RT reaction and absence of template during PCR. The PCR cycling was performed at 95 °C for 10 min and then 95 °C for 15 s and 60 °C for 1 min for a total of 45 cycles. The cycle threshold (CT) values corresponding to the PCR cycle number at which fluorescence emission in real time reaches a threshold above the base-line emission were determined using ABI Prism® 7700 software. For quality control, serial dilutions of cDNA plasmids for rat RGS2-RGS5 (0.3-3 × 106 copies) were tested, and the linearity of the resulting CT values was confirmed for RGS2 and RGS5 but not RGS3 or RGS4. Relative mRNA expression levels were therefore assessed by real time PCR for RGS2 and RGS5 only. CardioGenomics Microarray Data Base—The data base 4Genomics of Cardiovascular Development, Adaptation, and Remodeling: NHLBI Program for Genomic Applications, Harvard Medical School, available on the World Wide Web at www.cardiogenomics.org. was mined for information on RGS mRNA expression in response to aortic constriction. Signals from each chip (Affymetrix MG-U74) were subjected to linear normalization and analyzed with the Affymetrix Microarray Suite 5 algorithm. Similar results were obtained upon additional nonlinear normalization at the probe level (data not shown). Western Blot Analysis—HEK-293 cells and neonatal ventricular myocytes (NVM) were lysed in 1× lysis buffer (Cell Signaling Technology) with protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science) for 30 min at 4 °C and sonicated for 3 × 5 s (NVM only). Ventricular tissue was homogenized on ice in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 6 mm MgCl2, 75 mm sucrose, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA plus proteinase inhibitor mixture with a hand-held tissue tearer (five bursts of 10 s at 8000-10,000 rpm). Protein was measured using the DC Protein Assay kit (Bio-Rad) with bovine serum albumin as a standard. Equal amounts of protein per lane were separated on 4-12% SDS-polyacrylamide (Tris/glycine) gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Protran; Schleicher and Schuell). After transfer, the membranes were stained with Ponceau S to confirm equal loading and even transfer efficiency, blocked in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 5% nonfat dry milk, and probed with monoclonal antibodies against the FLAG epitope (M2, 10 μg/ml; Sigma), GAPDH (0.5 μg/ml, Ambion), and caveolin-3 (1:5000; Transduction Laboratories) as well as polyclonal antibodies against the C terminus of RGS2 (CKKPQITTEPHAT; 1:1000; gift from Drs. B. Blake and D. P. Siderovski, University of North Carolina), Gαq/11 (C-19), PLCβ1 (G-12), and PLCβ3 (C-20; 1;500 each; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA). After three washes with PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20 and incubation with appropriate peroxidase-coupled secondary antibodies, proteins of interest were visualized by chemiluminescence (SuperSignal® West Pico Substrate; Pierce) using horseradish-conjugated secondary antibodies (ImmunoPure®; Pierce). Detection of endogenous RGS proteins by Western blot analysis is notoriously difficult due to their low abundance. To increase the protein amount loaded, particulate and soluble proteins from ventricular tissue were extracted by ultracentrifugation (50,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C), separated on 15% SDS-PAGE (60 μg/lane), and immunoblotted as described above. Only one of five RGS2 antibodies tested recognized endogenous ventricular RGS2 protein by enhanced chemiluminescence (Fig. 1D). It recognized a double band in the appropriate molecular weight range that had a slightly faster mobility than His6-tagged RGS2 (provided by Dr. C. W. Dessauer (University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston); data not shown) and was absent in crude homogenates of brain cortex (provided by Dr. D. P. Siderovski (University of North Carolina)) from RGS2 knock-out (KO) mice. It is conceivable that the two bands reflect the presence of alternative splice forms or posttranslational modifications. Importantly, RGS2 was reduced in the particulate fraction from αq*52 ventricles compared with wild type (see Fig. 1D). Due to low signal intensity, expression of soluble RGS2 protein could not be reliably assessed (data not shown). Only two of the other four RGS2 antibodies tested also recognized protein in the appropriate molecular weight range. However, the fact that the corresponding bands were still present in samples lacking RGS2, suggested cross-reaction with other proteins. Generation of RGS2 RNAi Expression Plasmid and siRNA—RNA interference target sequences were selected using a publicly available algorithm (Ambion pSilencer insert design tool). Selection criteria were as follows: (i) sequence starting with AA, (ii) GC content of ≤50%, preferably 30-50%, (iii) avoidance of a ≥4 contiguous run of any nucleotide, and (iv) BLAST against the appropriate genome to avoid excessive homology to other genes, avoiding ≥15-nucleotide contiguous 100% homology or ≥17-nucleotide interrupted homology. The target sequences tested were as follows: sequence 1, AATGAAGCGGACACTCTTAAA; sequence 2, AAATATGGGCTTGCTGCATTC; sequence 3, AACCAAATCACCACAGAAACT; sequence 4, AAGGAAAATATACACCGACTT; sequence 5, AATATCCAAGAGGCTACAAGT; sequence 6, AACAACTCTTATCCTCGTTTC. A pair of complementary oligonucleotides encoding a short hairpin (shRNA) sequence (sense and antisense target sequence separated by a 9-nucleotide loop sequence) plus BamHI and HindIII restriction sites at the ends were synthesized, annealed, and subcloned into a plasmid (pSilencer 3.0-H1 vector; Ambion) at the BamHI and HindIII restriction sites between a human H1 RNA polymerase III promoter and a RNA polymerase III terminator sequence. pSilencer plasmids containing siRNA hairpin sequences of GAPDH or without significant homology to any known rat gene (Ambion) were used as positive and negative controls, respectively. Inserted sequences were confirmed by restriction enzyme digestion and DNA sequencing. In addition, siRNAs corresponding to the shRNA sequences were synthesized and high pressure liquid chromatography-purified by Ambion. Cell Culture and Transfection—HEK-293 cells were maintained in DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics and transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 following the instructions of the manufacturer (Invitrogen). Lipofectamine 2000 was first diluted in OPTI-MEM I (Invitrogen) and then mixed with plasmid DNA or siRNA at the indicated amounts. The ratio (w/w) between Lipofectamine 2000 and DNA or RNA was 4:1 or 3.7:1, respectively. One and 2 ml of medium/well were used for 12- and 6-well plates, respectively. Following a 20-min incubation at room temperature, the DNA- or RNA-Lipofectamine 2000 mixture was added to antibiotics-free transfection medium (DMEM containing glutamine plus 10% fetal bovine serum) and replaced cell culture medium. The cells were maintained in a 37 °C incubator with 95% O2, 5% CO2 until analysis. The medium was changed to medium with no DNA or siRNA 24 h after transfection. Cardiomyocyte Isolation—NVM were isolated from 2-day-old Sprague-Dawley rats by enzymatic digestion (23Deng X.F. Rokosh D.G. Simpson P.C. Circ. Res. 2000; 87: 781-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), separated from non-muscle cells on a discontinuous Percoll gradient (24Pasumarthi K.B. Kardami E. Cattini P.A. Circ. Res. 1996; 78: 126-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), and plated in serum-containing DMEM (4 × 105 cells/well of a 6-well dish). Adult ventricular myocytes (AVM) were isolated from male Sprague-Dawley rats (200-300 g) by collagenase II digestion using Langendorff perfusion (25Ellingsen O. Davidoff A.J. Prasad S.K. Berger H.J. Springhorn J.P. Marsh J.D. Kelly R.A. Smith T.W. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: H747-H754Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and plated on laminin-coated 6-well dishes (2 × 105 cells/well) in Medium 199 supplemented with 2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 2 mm l-carnitine, 5 mm creatine, 5 mm taurine, 0.1 μm insulin (ACCTI “defined culture medium” (26Volz A. Piper H.M. Siegmund B. Schwartz P. J. Mol. Cell Cardiol. 1991; 23: 161-173Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Cardiomyocyte siRNA Transfection—AVM and NVM were transfected with siRNA 1 or 2 days after isolation, respectively, in the same way as HEK-293 cells (see above), albeit in different media. For NVM, the transfection medium was composed of DMEM, 2 mm glutamine, and 2% fetal bovine serum. The transfection medium was replaced with serum-free DMEM containing 2 mm glutamine, 1× ITS Liquid Media Supplement (Sigma), and penicillin/streptomycin 24 h after transfection. For AVM, the transfection medium was identical to the ACCTI culture medium and was replaced with fresh ACCTI culture medium 24 h after transfection. Fluorescent Labeling of RGS2 siRNA—RGS2 siRNA (5 μg) was labeled with fluorescin (FAM)-labeling reagent (Silencer™ labeling kit; Ambion) for 1 h at 37°C in the dark according to the manufacturer’s instructions and then precipitated by ethanol. Increasing concentrations (0-50 nm) of FAM-labeled RGS2 siRNA were transfected into NVM as described above, and cellular siRNA uptake was documented by fluorescent microscopy. Immunofluorescent Staining—Immunofluorescent staining in HEK293 cells and cardiomyocytes was performed as previously described (27Peterson D.J. Ju H. Hao J. Panagia M. Chapman D.C. Dixon I.M. Cardiovasc. Res. 1999; 41: 575-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In brief, cells were fixed in a solution containing 4% paraformaldehyde, 0.9% NaCl, and 0.1 m NaH2PO4 (pH 7.4) for 15 min at room temperature. After permeabilization with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 15 min at room temperature, nonspecific binding sites were blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin in PBS for 2 h at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C. They were then incubated in 1% bovine serum albumin/PBS containing mouse monoclonal antibodies against myosin (MF-20, 1:100 dilution; Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank) or the FLAG epitope (M2, 1:1000; Sigma), followed by incubation with rhodamine- or fluorescein-conjugated secondary antibodies (goat anti-mouse from Pierce (1:200) and goat anti-rabbit from Amersham Biosciences (1:50), respectively), each for 1.5 h at room temperature. Phospholipase Cβ Activity—Total inositol phosphate formation was measured as a surrogate parameter for PLCβ activity as described (19Mende U. Kagen A. Meister M. Neer E.J. Circ. Res. 1999; 85: 1085-1091Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Briefly, 24 h after siRNA infection, NVM and AVM were labeled in inositol-free medium supplemented with myo-[3H]inositol (2 μCi/well, 15 Ci/mmol; Amersham Biosciences) overnight. The next day, LiCl (10 mm final) was added before the addition of phenylephrine (PE) plus timolol (Tim) or endothelin-1 (ET-1) at increasing concentrations. After 30 min at 37 °C, inositol phosphates were extracted in 20 mm formic acid, neutralized, separated by anion exchange chromatography (Dowex AG1-X8), and quantitated by liquid scintillation counting. Cell density was monitored for each condition. Normalization to protein amount/well yielded similar results (data not shown). Assessment of Mitogen-activated Protein Kinase (MAPK) Activation—After siRNA transfection of NVM for 48 h, PE/Tim (1/0.1 μm) or ET-1 (10 nm) was added to the medium for the indicated incubation times (5 or 20 min). Cells were washed with PBS and lysed in 1× lysis buffer (Cell Signaling) with protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Sciences) for 30 min at 4 °C and sonicated for 3 × 5 s. Equal quantities of protein lysates were separated on 12% SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose. Nitrocellulose strips were incubated with antibodies against ERK1/2, p38, and JNK (all 1:1000; Cellular Signaling) that either recognized their respective phosphorylated forms only (9101, 9211, and 9255) or both phosphorylated and unphosphorylated MAPKs (9102, 9212, and 9252). After three washes with Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20 and incubation with appropriate peroxidase-coupled secondary antibodies, proteins of interest were visualized by chemiluminescence (SuperSignal® West Pico Substrate; Pierce). Assessment of Myocyte Hypertrophy—After siRNA transfection of NVM for 48 h, PE/Tim or ET-1 was added to the medium at the indicated concentrations. After 72 h, myocyte size was assessed in MF-20-stained myocytes using ImageProPlus software (MediaCybernetics). Protein synthesis was measured in quadruplicates for each condition by continuous labeling of cell protein with [14C]phenylalanine (0.05 μCi/ml, >450 mCi/mmol; ICN) during treatment with Gq/11-coupled receptor agonists (23Deng X.F. Rokosh D.G. Simpson P.C. Circ. Res. 2000; 87: 781-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). On the day of the assay, cells were washed with PBS, followed by precipitation of cellular protein with 10% trichloroacetic acid for atleast 1 h at 4 °C. Cellular proteins were washed once with 10% trichloroacetic acid, solubilized in 1% SDS for 1 h at 37°C, and then quantified by liquid scintillation counting. Statistical Analyses—Data are reported as mean ± S.E. for n determinations or mean ± range of duplicate determinations, as indicated. Each assay is representative of at least two additional independent assays. Statistical differences were assessed where appropriate by unpaired, two-tailed Student’s t test or 2-way analysis of variance followed by Bonferroni post-tests for comparison of individual means (GraphPad Prism 4). p values smaller than 0.05 were considered statistically significant. Expression of Endogenous RGS Proteins in Hearts with Enhanced Gq/11 Signaling—Using Northern blot analysis and RT-PCR, we examined mRNA expression of the major cardiac RGS proteins in two different models of Gq/11-mediated hypertrophy, both prior to and during hypertrophic remodeling. Transgenic Mice with Heart-restricted Gαq* Expression—We previously reported that Gαq* expression in vivo constitutively elevates cardiac PLCβ activity (14Mende U. Kagen A. Cohen A. Aramburu J.

Res. 1999; 85: 1085-1091Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) and provided a detailed phenotypic characterization (ventricular weights and hypertrophic marker gene expression, echocardiography, and signaling changes) of two independent lines (αq*52 and αq*44h (20Mende U.

https://openalex.org/W2039480541,"Molecular cloning studies have revealed that heterogeneity of T-type Ca2+ currents in native tissues arises from the three isoforms of Cav3 channels: Cav3.1, Cav3.2, and Cav3.3. From pharmacological analysis of the recombinant T-type channels, low concentrations (<50 μm) of nickel were found to selectively block the Cav3.2 over the other isoforms. To date, however, the structural element(s) responsible for the nickel block on the Cav3.2 T-type Ca2+ channel remain unknown. Thus, we constructed chimeric channels between the nickel-sensitive Cav3.2 and the nickel-insensitive Cav3.1 to localize the region interacting with nickel. Systematic assaying of serial chimeras suggests that the region preceding domain I S4 of Cav3.2 contributes to nickel block. Point mutations of potential nickel-interacting sites revealed that H191Q in the S3–S4 loop of domain I significantly attenuated the nickel block of Cav3.2, mimicking the nickel-insensitive blocking potency of Cav3.1. These findings indicate that His-191 in the S3–S4 loop is a critical residue conferring nickel block to Cav3.2 and reveal a novel role for the S3–S4 loop to control ion permeation through T-type Ca2+ channels.

Thus, we constructed chimeric channels between the nickel-sensitive Cav3.2 and the nickel-insensitive Cav3.1 to localize the region interacting with nickel. Systematic assaying of serial chimeras suggests that the region preceding domain I S4 of Cav3.2 contributes to nickel block. Point mutations of potential nickel-interacting sites revealed that H191Q in the S3–S4 loop of domain I significantly attenuated the nickel block of Cav3.2, mimicking the nickel-insensitive blocking potency of Cav3.1. These findings indicate that His-191 in the S3–S4 loop is a critical residue conferring nickel block to Cav3.2 and reveal a novel role for the S3–S4 loop to control ion permeation through T-type Ca2+ channels. Calcium entry through low voltage-activated T-type Ca2+ channels causes a rise in cytoplasmic Ca2+ concentrations, which subsequently triggers numerous physiological functions including neuronal excitability, cardiac pacemaker activity, hormone secretion, smooth muscle contraction, fertilization, and gene expression (1Chemin J.

Overexpression of T-type channels appears to be linked to pathophysiological conditions such as absence epilepsy, pain, cardiac arrhythmia, and hypertrophy (6Tsakiridou E. Bertollini L. de Curtis M.

Metallic divalent ions such as Cd2+, Co2+, Ni2+, Pb2+, and Zn2+ have been found to inhibit Ca2+ permeation via voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels with different potencies (10Yang J. Ellinor P.T.

It was generally accepted that Cd2+ selectively blocked all types of high voltage-activated (HVA) 3The abbreviation used is: HVA, high voltage-activated. 3The abbreviation used is: HVA, high voltage-activated. channels, whereas Ni2+ was selective for low voltage-activated T-type Ca2+ channels (10Yang J. Ellinor P.T. Sather W.A. Zhang J.F. Tsien R.W. Nature. 1993; 366: 158-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar, 14Huguenard J.R. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1996; 58: 329-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar). T-type Ca2+ currents endogenously expressed in sinoatrial nodal cells and dorsal root ganglion neurons were shown to be selectively blocked by low concentrations of Ni2+ (<50 μm) (2Hagiwara N.

Neurophysiol. 1998; 79: 240-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). On the contrary, it has also been reported that T-type Ca2+ currents in other neuronal cells required much higher concentrations of nickel to be blocked (14Huguenard J.R. Annu. Rev.

The tissue-dependent variability in nickel sensitivities strongly suggests heterogeneity of T-type channels. Indeed, recent molecular cloning and expression studies demonstrated that the T-type Ca2+ channel family consists of three members, Cav3.1 (α1G), Cav3.2 (α1H), and Cav3.3 (α1I) (16Perez-Reyes E.

Consequent pharmacological analysis of nickel block of the T-type Ca2+ channel isoforms revealed that Cav3.2 was the only nickel-sensitive isoform (IC50 for block = 5–10 μm), whereas Cav3.1 and Cav3.3 were as nickel-insensitive (IC50 for block ≥ 100 μm) as most HVA channels (11Zamponi G.W.

J. 1999; 77: 3034-3042Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar). In the present study, we investigated the structural element(s) involved in nickel block of Cav3.2 by assaying chimeric channels between the nickel-sensitive Cav3.2 and the nickel-insensitive Cav3.1. Single point mutation experiments identified that the His-191 in the extracellular loop connecting S3 and S4 of domain I is a key structural determinant critical for nickel block of the Cav3.2. Chemicals—Nickel (II) chloride hexahydrate (NiCl2·6H2O) was obtained from Sigma (St. Louis). Most of the other chemicals were purchased from Sigma and USB (Cleveland, OH). A nickel stock solution (100 mm) was made in deionized water and stored at room temperature. A series of nickel solutions (in μm: 1, 3, 10, 30, 100, 300, 1000, 3000) were prepared by diluting the nickel stock solution with 10 mm Ba2+ solution just before experiments, and their pH values were adjusted to 7.6. Construction of Chimeras between Cav3.1 and Cav3.2—The chimeric channels were constructed by modification of the cDNAs encoding the rat Cav3.1 (α1G, GenBank™ accession number AF027984) and human Cav3.2 (α1H, GenBank™ accession number AF051946) channels, for which PCR was used to add silent or non-silent restriction enzyme sites. The chimeric channels were subcloned into the pGEM-HEA vector containing 5′ and 3′ untranslated regions of a Xenopus β-globin gene for better expression in oocytes (20Chuang R.S. Jaffe H. Cribbs L. Perez-Reyes E. Swartz K.J. Nat. Neurosci. 1998; 1: 668-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). The methods for construction of the chimeric channels have been reported previously (21Park J.Y. Kang H.W. Jeong S.W. Lee J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 21707-21713Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Details of their construction are given below, where the restriction endonuclease sites and the nucleotide positions in the respective channel cDNAs are designated in parentheses. In some cases a restriction site was introduced by PCR, and these are indicated by asterisks for silent mutations and crosses for mutations that change the protein sequence. HHGG—A HindIII site was introduced at 3959, corresponding to the loop connecting domain II and III of the Cav3.2 by PCR. The forward primer was 5′-CCCGAGGAGCTGACTAATGC-3′, and reverse primer was 5′-AAAAGCTTGTGTGTGATGACCTT. The full-length cDNA of HHGG was constructed by ligating ClaI (5′-polylinker)-PvuI (3725, Cav3.2), PvuI (3728, Cav3.2)-HindIII+ (3963, Cav3.2), HindIII+ (4246, Cav3.1)-KpnI (6170, Cav3.1), and KpnI (6175, Cav3.1)-AflII (3′-polylinker) into the ClaI-(5′-polylinker) and AflII-digested (3′-polylinker) plasmid pGEM-HEA.

HGGG—The plasmid HGGG was constructed by ligating ClaI(5′-polylinker)-HindIII* (1424, Cav3.2) into the plasmid Cav3.1 pGEM-HEA, which was opened by ClaI (5′-polylinker) and HindIII (1758, Cav3.1). GHGG—The plasmid GHGG was constructed by ligating the following fragments, ClaI (5′-polylinker)-BspEI (2696, Cav3.1) and BspEI+ (2437, Cav3.2)-HindIII+ (3963, Cav3.2) into the plasmid HHGG, which was opened by ClaI (5′-polylinker) and HindIII+ (3960, HHGG). HGGG/GIS5-Ipore—The plasmid HGGG/GIS5-Ipore was constructed by ligating the fragments ClaI (5′-polylinker)-BamHI (733, Cav3.2), BamHI* (1076, Cav3.1)-SalI (1555, Cav3.1) and SalI* (1221, Cav3.2)-HindIII* (1424, Cav3.2) into the plasmid Cav3.1 pGEM-HEA, which was opened by ClaI (5′-polylinker) and HindIII (1758, Cav3.1). GGGG/HN-IS4—The plasmid GGGG/HN-IS4 was constructed by ligating the fragments, ClaI (5′-polylinker)-BamHI (733, Cav3.2) and BamHI* (1076, Cav3.1)-SalI (1555, Cav3.1) into the plasmid Cav3.1 pGEM-HEA, which was opened by ClaI (5′-polylinker) and SalI(1552, Cav3.1). Cav3.2/H191Q (HHHH/H191Q)—The plasmid Cav3.2/H191Q was constructed by ligating the fragments ClaI (5′-polylinker)-BamHI (733, HGGG/H191Q) and BamHI (730, Cav3.2)-SalI (4638, Cav3.2) into the plasmid Cav3.2 pGEM-HEA, which was opened by ClaI (5′-polylinker) and SalI (4635, Cav3.2). Site-directed Mutagenesis—Point mutations were generated using two-step PCR methods (22Horton R.M. Hunt H.D. Ho S.N. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 61-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (2634) Google Scholar). HGGG/E137Q—The forward and reverse primers to amplify the upper fragments covering from the 5′-polylinker to 499 (nucleotide number of Cav3.2) were 5′-TAATACGACTCACTATAGGG-3′ (T7 promoter sequence) and 5′-TCAAAGGCCTGCAGGATGTTGCAGCGCTC-3′, respectively. The forward and reverse primers to amplify the lower fragments covering from 479 to 1228 (nucleotide number of Cav3.2) were 5′-AACATCCTGCAGGCCTTTGACGCCTTCATT-3′ and 5′-GATGTCGACCCAGCCTTCCAG-3′, respectively. The amplified DNA fragments were purified and then combined by additional PCR. The plasmid HGGG/E137Q was constructed by inserting the PCR-generated DNA cassette digested with ClaI and SalI into the plasmid Cav3.1 pGEM-HEA, which was opened by ClaI (5′-polylinker) and SalI (1552, Cav3.1). HGGG/H191Q—The forward and reverse primers to amplify the upper fragments covering from the 5′-polylinker to 682 (nucleotide number of Cav3.2) were T7 promoter sequence and 5′-GGCTCACGTTCTGTCCGTCCAACGAGTACTC-3′, respectively. The forward and reverse primers to amplify the lower fragments covering from 641 to 1228 (nucleotide number of Cav3.2) were 5′-TTGGACGGACAGAACGTGAGCCTCTCGGCTAT-3′ and 5′-GATGTCGACCCAGCCTTCCAG-3′, respectively. The upper and lower DNA fragments were purified and then combined by additional PCR. The plasmid HGGG/H191Q was constructed by inserting the PCR-generated DNA cassette digested with ClaI and SalI into the plasmid Cav3.1 pGEM-HEA, which was opened by ClaI (5′-polylinker) and SalI (1552, Cav3.1). Cav3.1/Q172H (GGGG/Q172H)—The forward and reverse primers to amplify the upper fragments covering from the 5′-polylinker to 1008 (nucleotide number of Cav3.1) were T7 promoter sequence and 5′-AGCTGACGTTGTGCAGGTCCAGCGAATACTCC-3′, respectively. The forward and reverse primers to amplify the lower fragments covering from 988 to 1762 (nucleotide number of Cav3.1) were 5′-TGGACCTGCACAACGTCAGCTTCTCCGCA-3′ and 5′-GAGAAGCTTGCCAGGGTGCTAGC-3′, respectively. The amplified upper and lower DNA fragments were purified and then combined by additional PCR. The plasmid Cav3.1/Q172H was constructed by inserting the PCR-generated DNA cassette digested with ClaI and HindIII into the plasmid Cav3.1 pGEM-HEA, which was opened by ClaI (5′-polylinker) and HindIII (1755, Cav3.1). All PCRs were performed using Pfu Ultra DNA polymerase (Stratagene), and the entire region derived from PCR products was sequenced to verify correct introduction of point mutated site(s) and that there were no inadvertent mutations. Preparation of Oocytes and Expression of Chimeric Channels—Several ovary lobes were surgically removed from mature female Xenopus laevis (Xenopus Express, France) and torn into small clusters of 3–5 oocytes in SOS solution (100 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 5 mm HEPES, 2.5 mm pyruvic acid, and 50 μg/ml gentamicin, pH 7.6). To remove follicle membranes, isolated oocytes were treated with collagenase (Type IA, 2 mg/ml) and were treated for 30 min in Ca2+-free OR2 solution (82.5 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.6). All cDNAs encoding Cav3.1, Cav3.2, and chimeric channels were linearized by AflII and used as templates. Capped cRNAs were synthesized in vitro using T7 RNA polymerase provided in the mMessage mMachine transcription kit in according to the manufacturer’s instruction (Ambion, Austin, TX). The cRNAs were injected into oocytes at concentrations of 10–50 ng/50 nl using a Drummond Nanoject pipette injector (Parkway, PA) attached to a Narishige micromanipulator (Tokyo, Japan). SOS solution was changed daily. Electrophysiology and Data Analysis—Barium currents were measured using a two-microelectrode voltage clamp amplifier (OC-725C, Warner Instruments, Hamden, CT) between the third and eighth day after cRNA injection. Microelectrodes (Warner Instruments) were broken to decrease the electrode resistance to 0.2–1.0 megohms and filled with 3 m KCl. The bath solution contained 10 mm Ba(OH)2, 90 mm NaOH, 1 mm KOH, and 5 mm HEPES (pH 7.4 with methanesulfonic acid). The currents were acquired at 5 kHz and low pass-filtered at 1 kHz using the pClamp system (Digidata 1320A and pClamp 8, Axon instruments, Foster City, CA). Data were analyzed using the Clampfit software (Axon instruments) and presented graphically using the Prism software (GraphPad, San Diego, CA). Dose-response curves were fitted using the Hill equation: B = (1 + IC50/(Ni2+)n)–1, where B is the normalized block, IC50 is the concentration of Ni2+ giving half-maximal inhibition, and n is the Hill coefficient. Data are presented as means ± S.E. and tested for significance using Student’s unpaired t test. Prior to testing the chimeric channels, we first confirmed the effects of nickel on wild-type Cav3.1 and Cav3.2 channels. Peak Ba2+ currents were elicited by test pulses to –20 mV from a holding potential of –90 mV every 15 s. Expression of the T-type Ca2+ channels were detected as robust inward currents from the third day after cRNA injection. Application of serial nickel solutions inhibited Ba2+ currents through the Cav3.1 or Cav3.2 channels in a dose-dependent manner, and the inhibited currents could be reversed by washing (Fig 1, A and B). The Cav3.1 currents required high concentrations of nickel to be blocked. In contrast, the Cav3.2 currents were highly sensitive to nickel block. On average, the IC50 values for inhibiting the Cav3.1 and Cav3.2 channels were 304.8 ± 6.2 and 4.9 ± 2.0 μm, respectively (Fig. 1, C and D), being consistent with previous studies (19Lee J.H. Gomora J.C. Cribbs L.L. Perez-Reyes E. Biophys. J. 1999; 77: 3034-3042Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar). Comparison of current-voltage (I-V) relationships of Cav3.1 or Cav3.2 currents before and after nickel treatment showed that nickel inhibition positively shifted the I-V relationships (Fig. 1, E and F). Consistently, the half-activation potentials were found to be positively shifted by nickel (Table 1).TABLE 1Summary of nickel blocking effects on the Cav3.1, Cav3.2, and their mutant channelsConstructIC50Hill slopeV50 for activationSlopeV50 for inactivationSlopeτinactControlNi2+ControlNi2+ControlNi2+ControlNi2+ControlNi2+μmmVmVkkmVmVkkmsmsGGGG304.8 ± 6.20.92 ± 0.08-45.8 ± 0.4-38.7 ± 0.4ap < 0.05.6.2 ± 0.46.4 ± 0.3-65.0 ± 0.3-61.7 ± 0.5ap < 0.05.3.5 ± 0.34.2 ± 0.56.3 ± 0.26.5 ± 0.2HHHH4.9 ± 2.00.80 ± 0.07-33.2 ± 0.4-27.9 ± 0.5ap < 0.05.6.6 ± 0.37.5 ± 0.4-58.8 ± 0.7-57.3 ± 1.43.9 ± 0.57.2 ± 1.3ap < 0.05.8.6 ± 0.911.9 ± 0.6ap < 0.05.GGHH307.3 ± 8.10.93 ± 0.08-44.2 ± 0.3-37.0 ± 0.4ap < 0.05.5.5 ± 0.26.5 ± 0.4-68.4 ± 0.3-64.8 ± 0.3ap < 0.05.3.8 ± 0.34.3 ± 0.37.0 ± 0.27.2 ± 0.2HHGG7.3 ± 2.20.84 ± 0.12-36.3 ± 0.4-32.7 ± 0.4ap < 0.05.6.9 ± 0.47.4 ± 0.3-62.2 ± 0.5-64.1 ± 1.15.3 ± 0.58.0 ± 1.1ap < 0.05.9.5 ± 0.311.9 ± 0.3bp < 0.01.HGGG4.7 ± 1.80.80 ± 0.07-42.2 ± 0.4-35.4 ± 0.7ap < 0.05.6.3 ± 0.48.7 ± 0.7-66.4 ± 0.4-64.0 ± 1.04.0 ± 0.46.6 ± 1.0ap < 0.05.9.6 ± 0.214.2 ± 0.5ap < 0.05.GHGG291.1 ± 5.20.95 ± 0.04-43.2 ± 0.1-36.2 ± 0.3ap < 0.05.5.1 ± 0.16.4 ± 0.3-68.6 ± 0.3-65.8 ± 0.44.6 ± 0.34.8 ± 0.46.8 ± 0.36.8 ± 0.3HGGG/GIS5-Ipore4.7 ± 1.91.04 ± 0.12-42.2 ± 0.4-36.1 ± 0.8ap < 0.05.6.1 ± 0.47.9 ± 0.8-65.0 ± 0.3-62.0 ± 0.84.0 ± 0.35.6 ± 0.7ap < 0.05.9.0 ± 0.311.3 ± 0.8ap < 0.05.GGGG/HN-IS43.9 ± 2.11.01 ± 0.03-43.3 ± 0.4-36.6 ± 0.6ap < 0.05.6.2 ± 0.48.3 ± 0.6-67.0 ± 0.4-65.0 ± 0.84.2 ± 0.36.3 ± 0.8ap < 0.05.11.9 ± 0.717.0 ± 0.9bp < 0.01.HGGG/E137Q5.1 ± 1.21.01 ± 0.02-41.9 ± 0.4-32.6 ± 0.5ap < 0.05.6.6 ± 0.48.9 ± 0.5-65.9 ± 0.3-63.0 ± 0.74.1 ± 0.36.4 ± 0.7ap < 0.05.11.4 ± 0.317.0 ± 0.9bp < 0.01.HGGG/H191Q312.5 ± 4.20.90 ± 0.02-46.3 ± 0.5-38.4 ± 0.5ap < 0.05.6.6 ± 0.58.2 ± 0.5-69.2 ± 0.3-66.9 ± 0.44.4 ± 0.34.3 ± 0.411.5 ± 0.311.8 ± 0.3Cav3.2/H191Q306.6 ± 7.10.96 ± 0.05-39.8 ± 0.4-32.1 ± 0.5ap < 0.05.7.1 ± 0.48.3 ± 0.5-66.4 ± 0.3-61.2 ± 0.3ap < 0.05.3.9 ± 0.34.4 ± 0.310.6 ± 0.211.8 ± 0.9Cav3.1/Q172H61.3 ± 3.70.85 ± 0.12-44.5 ± 0.3-39.0 ± 0.4ap < 0.05.6.6 ± 0.36.9 ± 0.3-70.5 ± 0.3-66.4 ± 0.33.7 ± 0.34.0 ± 0.36.4 ± 0.38.4 ± 0.6ap < 0.05.a p < 0.05.b p < 0.01. Open table in a new tab Based on the different potencies of nickel block between the Cav3.1 (GGGG) and Cav3.2 (HHHH), we investigated what structural portion(s) endowed Cav3.2 with nickel sensitivity. In this regard, sensitivities of nickel block were examined for a series of chimeric channels (Fig. 2). Of the two half-half chimeras, the GGHH currents were blocked by relatively high concentrations of nickel. On average, the IC50 value of GGHH was 307.3 ± 8.1 μm (n = 6), similar to that for Cav3.1 (GGGG). On the contrary, the HHGG currents were sensitively blocked by low concentrations of nickel. On average, the IC50 value was 7.3 ± 2.2 μm (n = 5), similar to that for the Cav3.2. These findings suggested that the structural element(s) contributing to high nickel sensitivity were located in the first half (domain I and II) but not on the second half (domain III and IV) of the Cav3.2. Our next step was to transfer a single domain of Cav3.2 into Cav3.1. The HGGG currents were found to be blocked by low concentrations to nickel. In contrast, the GHGG currents required much higher concentrations of nickel to be blocked. The IC50 values for blocking HGGG and GHGG were 4.7 ± 1.8 μm (n = 5) and 291.1 ± 5.2 μm (n = 6), respectively. Taken together, the potency of nickel block for the HGGG was very close to that of the wild-type Cav3.2, indicating that the domain I of the Cav3.2 contains the essential structural element(s) determining the nickel-sensitive block. The identified domain I of the Cav3.2 was further dissected to narrow down the exact region(s) contributing to the nickel block. We initially hypothesized that the pore loop and S6 of the domain I, known to be essential for ion permeation and selectivity, are involved in the nickel block. However, it is unlikely that these structural portions contribute to the high nickel sensitivity, because the Cav3.1 and Cav3.2 contain identical amino acid sequences in these regions. Our next hypothesis was that the extracellular loop connecting the S5 and the pore is involved in the nickel block, because the extracellular loop sequences are quite different between the two T-type channels. However, the extracellular loop mutant channel, HGGG/GIS5-Ipore (where the IS5-pore loop of HGGG was replaced with the corresponding one of the Cav3.1) was still sensitive to nickel (IC50 = 4.7 ± 1.9 μm, n = 5). These results restricted the nickel interacting site(s) within the remaining region from the amino terminus to S4 (IS4) of domain I of the Cav3.2. To examine the relevance of this region, GGGG/HN-IS4 was constructed. As expected, the chimeric channel currents were blocked by low concentrations of nickel (IC50 = 3.9 ± 2.1 μm, n = 9), for the GGGG/HN-IS4, which was slightly lower than that for the wild-type Cav3.2. These findings indicate that essential structural determinant(s) for the nickel-sensitive block reside between the amino terminus and IS4. Next, we postulated that nickel may interact with regions preceding to IS4, such as with residue(s) in the extracellular loops between IS1 and IS2, and/or IS3 and IS4. To identify putative nickel-interacting residue(s), we aligned the amino acid sequences in the regions prior to IS4 of the three T-type channel isoforms (Fig. 3A). Ni2+ can interact with histidine (H) and cysteine (C) residues and the acidic amino acids, aspartic acid (D) and glutamic acid (E) (23Van Horn J.D. Bulaj G. Goldenberg D.P. Burrows C.J. J. Biol.

Involvement of Glu-127 and Glu-131 in the IS1-IS2 loop of the Cav3.2 seems unlikely because aspartate (D), a negatively charged amino acid similar to glutamate (E), is found in the corresponding position of the nickel-insensitive Cav3.3 (IC50 = 87 μm for the nickel block; 19Lee J.H. Gomora J.C. Cribbs L.L. Perez-Reyes E. Biophys. J. 1999; 77: 3034-3042Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar). Glu-137 in the IS1–IS2 loop and His-191 in the IS3–IS4 loop are found only in Cav3.2 channels. Therefore, Glu-137 and His-191 of HGGG were individually point-mutated into glutamine (Q), which is found in the corresponding positions of Cav3.1. HGGG/E137Q currents were blocked by low concentrations of nickel. The IC50 value for the nickel block was 5.1 ± 1.2 μm (n = 8), similar to that of HGGG, suggesting that Glu-137 in the IS1-IS2 loop is not a crucial residue determining nickel block (Fig. 3, B and D). In contrast, HGGG/H191Q currents required much higher concentrations of nickel to be blocked, showing an IC50 of 312.5 ± 4.2 μm (n = 10). These findings show that the single point mutation of H191Q induced a 25-fold change in nickel sensitivity and suggest that His-191 accounts for the high nickel sensitivity observed with the HGGG chimera. We next sought to confirm the critical role of His-191 by mutating this residue in wild-type T-type channels. The application of nickel solutions dose-dependently inhibited Cav3.2/H191Q (HHHH/H191Q), and the inhibited currents could be reversed by washing (Fig 4A). On average, the IC50 for the nickel block was 306.6 ± 7.1 μm (n = 6), indicating that the H191Q mutation greatly reduced the nickel sensitivity of the channel. Another point mutation of H191A at the same location of the Cav3.2 also reduced the nickel sensitivity to a similar level (IC50 = 285.9 ± 3.1 μm, n = 7, Fig. 4B). I-V relationships of Cav3.2/H191Q currents in the absence and presence of 300 μm nickel showed that nickel shifted the I-V relationship to more depolarized potentials (Fig. 4C, Table 1). These results support our findings in the chimeric channels and show that His-191 in the IS3–IS4 loop confers the high nickel sensitivity to the Cav3.2. Finally, we examined whether Cav3.1 could be transformed into a nickel-sensitive channel by simply switching the corresponding glutamine (Q) of the Cav3.1 to histidine (H). Accordingly, Cav3.1/Q172H (GGGG/Q172H) was constructed, and its nickel sensitivity was assayed. Cav3.1/Q172H currents were inhibited by nickel solutions in a dose-dependent manner, and the inhibited currents were rapidly recovered by washing (Fig. 4D). Consistent with our hypothesis, the nickel blocking sensitivity of the GGGG/Q172H was increased 5-fold (IC50 = 61.3 ± 3.7 μm, n = 9), although it was not as sensitive as that of the Cav3.2 (Fig. 4, D and E). These results clearly show that His-191 is a key residue in the nickel binding pocket (Fig. 5). Alternatively, mutation of His-191 might have led to a rearrangement of the channel that disrupted the nickel binding pocket. Data arguing against this latter hypothesis are that the biophysical (Table 1) and pharmacological properties (mibefradil dose-response studies, results not shown) were not altered by H191Q mutation. Voltage-gated ion channels contain many conserved amino acids and are likely to be similar in structure-function. Therefore we have modeled repeat I of Cav3.2 using current models for the Shaker K+ channel (27Durell S.R. Shrivastava I.H. Guy H.R. Biophys. J. 2004; 87: 2116-2130Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Voltage-dependent gating is thought to begin with outward movement of S4 segments, which in turn leads to opening of the channel walls formed by S6 segments. In these models the S3-S4 linker is in close proximity to the extracellular face of S4, S5, and S6 segments; therefore it is likely that there is a nickel binding pocket on the extracellular surface of Cav3.2 channels. If so, then nickel should be able to bind to closed channels in the rested state and block their transition to open states. To test this prediction we exposed oocytes expressing Cav3.2 channels to nickel at a holding potential of –100 mV, then tested for channel availability (Fig. 6). Nickel evoked the same degree of block in the absence and presence of depolarizing test pulses, indicating that it could bind to closed channels. Voltage-gated calcium channels are highly selective for Ca2+ ions because they bind Ca2+ in the pore, thereby preventing permeation by monovalent cations. This binding site also binds other divalent cations such as Cd2+ with higher affinity, leading to the block of Ca2+ permeation. This binding site was localized to the pore loops by site-directed mutagenesis (10Yang J. Ellinor P.T. Sather W.A. Zhang J.F. Tsien R.W. Nature. 1993; 366: 158-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar) and in HVA channels is formed by glutamates (E) in each of the four repeats (EEEE locus). The mutation of these residues in Cav1.2 channels significantly decreased the affinity for cadmium binding (28Ellinor P.T. Yang J. Sather W.A. Zhang J.F. Tsien R.W. Neuron. 1995; 15: 1121-1132Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). In low voltage-activated channels two of these glutamates were replaced by aspartates (D), creating an EEDD locus. Replacement of these aspartates in Cav3.1 channels with glutamates confers a cadmium-sensitive block to Cav3.1, which requires much higher concentrations of cadmium to be blocked than HVA calcium channels (29Talavera K. Staes M. Janssens A. Klugbauer N. Droogmans G. Hofmann F. Nilius B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45628-45635Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Our previous studies indicated that nickel blocks Cav3 channels in part by binding within the permeation path (19Lee J.H. Gomora J.C. Cribbs L.L. Perez-Reyes E. Biophys. J. 1999; 77: 3034-3042Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar), presumably because of binding at the EEDD locus. Our present finding that nickel binds to the S3–S4 loop was unexpected and reveals a second site and mode of action. We propose that binding to the S3–S4 linker prevents movements associated with channel gating effectively stabilizing channels in closed states. A similar hypothesis was proposed by Zamponi et al. (11Zamponi G.W. Bourinet E. Snutch T.P. J. Membr. Biol. 1996; 151: 77-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar) for nickel effects on HVA channels, where nickel was found to shift activation gating at lower concentrations than it blocked permeation. Notably the HVA channel that showed the greatest shift in the voltage dependence of gating was Cav2.3. Comparison of the amino acid sequences of all 10 Ca2+ channel α1 subunits shows that only Cav3.2 and Cav2.3 contain a histidine in this region of the IS3–IS4 loop (His-179, GenBank™ accession number Q15878). Therefore, it is tempting to speculate that this residue might explain why Cav2.3 is more sensitive to the gating effects of nickel than other HVA channels. Previous studies have shown that α-scorpion toxins or sea anemone toxins significantly slow fast inactivation of voltage-gated sodium channels and slightly inhibit their current amplitude (30Rogers J.C. Qu Y. Tanada T.N. Scheuer T. Catterall W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15950-15962Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar, 31Chen H. Gordon D. Heinemann S.H. Pflugers Arch. 2000; 439: 423-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The main binding site of toxins was identified to be in the S3–S4 loop of domain IV of sodium channels, indicating that the structural determinant for prolonging the fast inactivation and inhibiting the activity of sodium channels is analogous to that for that nickel block of the Cav3.2. The structural and functional analogy between the two channels suggests that nickel might slow inactivation kinetics of Cav3.2. Analysis of current kinetics before and after nickel block shows that this was indeed the case for wild-type channels (19Lee J.H. Gomora J.C. Cribbs L.L. Perez-Reyes E. Biophys. J. 1999; 77: 3034-3042Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar), and in nickel-sensitive chimeras (Table 1), but was lost in the H191Q mutant of Cav3.2. The H191Q or H191A mutation in Cav3.2 lowered its nickel sensitivity to that observed for Cav3.1, and conversely, the Q172H mutation in Cav3.1 increased its nickel sensitivity 5-fold (IC50 = 61.3 ± 3.7 μm) approaching, but not quite matching, the sensitivity observed for Cav3.2. These results indicate that His-191 is a critical residue in nickel binding and that most of the other residues that form the nickel binding pocket are conserved. Because of their conservation these residues cannot be identified using the chimeric approach. The finding that Cav3.1 channels with the Q172H mutation are not as sensitive as Cav3.2 could be because either 1) the S3–S4 linker adopts a different conformation in Cav3.1 channels, thereby positioning the histidine in a slightly different orientation, or 2) that there are other residues involved in binding nickel in Cav3.2 that are not conserved in Cav3.1. A similar case has been reported for the nickel-induced augmentation of cyclic nucleotidegated channels, where mutation of the nickel-sensitive retinal cyclic nucleotide-gated channel at His-420 to the corresponding amino acid found in nickel-insensitive olfactory isoforms (Q) almost completely abolished the effect of nickel (32Gordon S.E. Zagotta W.N. Neuron. 1995; 14: 177-183Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Conversely, the Q to H mutation in olfactory channels conferred some nickel sensitivity, but it was still less sensitive than the rod isoforms. These results were interpreted as showing that His-420 might require other residues for coordinated interaction with Ni2+, because Ni2+ has 4–6 ligands and interacts weakly (Kd = 1mm) with a single imidazole of histidine (33Sillen L.G. Martell A.E. Stability Constants of Metal-Ion Complexes: Supplement, No. 1. Chemical Society London, 1971Google Scholar). The time course of nickel inhibition of both wild-type and mutant channels did not show any concentration dependence (Figs. 1 and 4). Therefore, we were unable to calculate the apparent affinity constant KD from the Kon and Koff rates. Apparently the on rate of block is faster than our perfusion speed. A second limitation of the present study is the relatively long time it takes to clamp the entire oocyte membrane, thereby precluding detailed studies of activation kinetics. Future analysis of the activation and blocking kinetics would be better studied using patch clamp electrophysiology of mammalian cells with a faster perfusion system. In summary, we have identified the histidine at position 191 as a key molecular determinant contributing to the high affinity block of Cav3.2 channels by nickel. This residue was localized using a series of chimeras between channels that show high affinity block (Cav3.2) and low affinity block (Cav3.1). Interestingly His-191 resides in the short (9-amino-acid long) loop that connects IS3 to the IS4 voltage sensor, rather than residing in the pore loops as might be expected from work on cadmium binding sites. Based on observations that nickel appears to block Cav channels at two sites (11Zamponi G.W. Bourinet E. Snutch T.P. J. Membr. Biol. 1996; 151: 77-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 19Lee J.H. Gomora J.C. Cribbs L.L. Perez-Reyes E. Biophys. J. 1999; 77: 3034-3042Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar), we propose that nickel binding to His-191 blocks the gating of channels to the open state by interrupting the coupling between S4 and the pore."

How SAHA mediates its effects is poorly understood. We found that in several human cancer cell lines, SAHA potentiated the apoptosis induced by tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and chemotherapeutic agents and inhibited TNF-induced invasion and receptor activator of NF-κB ligand-induced osteoclastogenesis, all of which are known to require NF-κB activation. These observations corresponded with the down-regulation of the expression of anti-apoptotic (IAP1, IAP2, X chromosome-linked IAP, Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, TRAF1, FLIP, and survivin), proliferative (cyclin D1, cyclooxygenase 2, and c-Myc), and angiogenic (ICAM-1, matrix metalloproteinase-9, and vascular endothelial growth factor) gene products. Because several of these genes are regulated by NF-κB, we postulated that SAHA mediates its effects by modulating NF-κB and found that SAHA suppressed NF-κB activation induced by TNF, IL-1β, okadaic acid, doxorubicin, lipopolysaccharide, H2O2, phorbol myristate acetate, and cigarette smoke; the suppression was not cell type-specific because both inducible and constitutive NF-κB activation was inhibited. We also found that SAHA had no effect on direct binding of NF-κB to the DNA but inhibited sequentially the TNF-induced activation of IκBα kinase, IκBα phosphorylation, IκBα ubiquitination, IκBα degradation, p65 phosphorylation, and p65 nuclear translocation. Furthermore, SAHA inhibited the NF-κB-dependent reporter gene expression activated by TNF, TNFR1, TRADD, TRAF2, NF-κB-inducing kinase, IκBα kinase, and the p65 subunit of NF-κB. Overall, our results indicated that NF-κB and NF-κB-regulated gene expression inhibited by SAHA can enhance apoptosis and inhibit invasion and osteoclastogenesis.

SAHA has been shown to induce differentiation, growth arrest, and apoptosis of transformed human cells in culture at micromolar concentrations.

SAHA also down-regulates the production of mediators of inflammation, including nitric oxide, tumor necrosis factor (TNF), interleukin (IL)-1β, and IL-12 (19Leoni F. Zaliani A. Bertolini G. Porro G.

A. 2002; 99: 2995-3000Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar).Because genes involved in the regulation of apoptosis, proliferation, angiogenesis, and inflammation are regulated by the transcription factor NF-κB, we postulated that SAHA mediates its effects by modulating NF-κB activation and the associated gene expression. NF-κB activation is regulated by IκBα kinase (IKK) and leads to IκBα phosphorylation, ubiquitination, and degradation and, sequentially, the release of NF-κB subunits p50 and p65 for translocation to the nucleus, binding to their consensus sequences, and induction of gene transcription.The present study was designed to determine whether SAHA mediates its effects by suppressing the NF-κB pathway. Specifically, we investigated the effects of SAHA on the cellular responses that require NF-κB activation, on the NF-κB activation pathway, and on NF-κB-regulated gene expression. Because TNF is a potent activator of the NF-κB activation pathway and because how TNF activates NF-κB is well characterized (20Aggarwal B.B. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2003; 3: 745-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (2112) Google Scholar), we used this inducer to examine the mechanism of action of SAHA. The results showed that SAHA potentiated apoptosis induced by TNF and chemotherapeutic agents and inhibited cell invasion and osteoclastogenesis. These effects were associated with the inhibition of NF-κB activation and NF-κB-regulated gene expression. The results of our studies provide a description of mechanisms through which SAHA could mediate its effects. The ability of SAHA to enhance apoptosis, suppress invasion, and inhibit osteoclastogenesis provides novel targets for cancer therapy.MATERIALS AND METHODSReagents—SAHA was purchased from Midwest Research Institute, Kansas, MO (other suppliers of SAHA include Aton Pharma, Inc., Terrytown, NY; BioVision, Mountain View, CA; Alexis Biochemicals, Grunberg, Germany).

Anti-IKK-α, anti-IKK-β, and anti-FLIP antibodies were kindly provided by Imgenex (San Diego, CA).Cell Lines—Human myeloid KBM-5 cells, mouse macrophage Raw 264.7 cells, human lung adenocarcinoma H1299 cells, human embryonic kidney A293 cells, and human squamous cell carcinoma MDA1986 and SCC-4 cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). KBM-5 cells were cultured in Iscove’s modified Dulbecco medium supplemented with 15% FBS. Raw 264.7 cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium/F-12 medium, H1299 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium, and A293 cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium supplemented with 10% FBS. MDA1986 and SCC-4 cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium containing 10% FBS, nonessential amino acids, pyruvate, glutamine, and vitamins. All media were also supplemented with 100 units/ml of penicillin and 100 μg/ml of streptomycin.Live and Dead Assay—To assess cytotoxicity, we used the Live and Dead assay (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR), which determines intracellular esterase activity and plasma membrane integrity as previously described (22Takada Y.

Chem. 2004; 279: 26287-26299Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar).Invasion Assay—The membrane invasion culture system was used to assess cell invasion because invasion through the extracellular matrix is a crucial step in tumor metastasis. The BD BioCoat Tumor Invasion system is a chamber that has a light-tight polyethylene terephthalate membrane with 8-μm-diameter pores and is coated with a reconstituted basement membrane gel (BD Biosciences). A total of 2.5 × 104 H1299 cells were suspended in serum-free medium and seeded into the upper wells. After incubation overnight, cells were treated with 3 μm SAHA for 12 h and then stimulated with 1 nm TNF for a further 24 h in the presence of 1% FBS and the SAHA. The cells that invaded through the Matrigel were stained with 4 μg/ml of Calcein AM (Molecular Probes) in phosphate-buffered saline for 30 min at 37 °C and subjected to scan fluorescence with a Victor 3 luminometer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences).Osteoclast Differentiation Assay—To determine whether SAHA could suppress RANKL-induced osteoclastogenesis, we cultured RAW 264.7 cells, which can differentiate into osteoclasts by RANKL in vitro (23Bharti A.C.

Chem. 2004; 279: 39541-39554Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar).RESULTSSAHA Potentiated Apoptosis Induced by TNF and Chemotherapeutic Agents—NF-κB activation inhibits apoptosis induced by TNF and chemotherapeutic agents (30Kumar A. Takada Y. Boriek A.M. Aggarwal B.B. J. Mol. Med. 2004; 82: 434-448Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We investigated whether SAHA affects such apoptosis in KBM-5 cells by using the Live and Dead, PARP cleavage, annexin V staining, TUNEL staining, and MTT methods. The Live and Dead assay indicated that SAHA up-regulated TNF-induced cytotoxicity from 5 to 59% (Fig. 1A). Whether the enhanced cytotoxicity was due to apoptosis was investigated. TNF-induced caspase activation, as indicated by PARP cleavage, was potentiated by SAHA (Fig. 1B). The results of annexin V staining indicated that SAHA up-regulated TNF-induced early apoptosis (Fig. 1C), and the results of TUNEL staining also showed that TNF-induced apoptosis was enhanced by incubation with SAHA (Fig. 1D). Moreover, SAHA enhanced TNF-induced cytotoxicity as analyzed by the MTT method (Fig. 1E). This histone deacetylase inhibitor also enhanced the cytotoxic effects of cisplatin, 5-FU, doxorubicin, and taxol (Fig. 1, F–I, respectively). The results from all these assays together suggest that SAHA enhances the apoptotic effects of TNF and chemotherapeutic agents.SAHA Suppressed TNF-induced Invasion Activity—The mechanism of tumor metastasis has been studied, and it is known that matrix metalloproteinases, cyclooxygenases, and adhesion molecules play a major role in it (31Liotta L.A. Thorgeirsson U.P. Garbisa S. Cancer Metastasis Rev. 1982; 1: 277-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). It is also known that TNF can induce tumor metastasis-related genes such as matrix metalloproteinase-9, COX-2, and ICAM-1 (30Kumar A. Takada Y. Boriek A.M. Aggarwal B.B. J. Mol. Med. 2004; 82: 434-448Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To investigate the effect of SAHA on TNF-induced metastatic activity, we examined the invasive activity in vitro. For this study, we seeded the H1299 cells into the upper wells of a Matrigel invasion chamber in the absence of serum. The cells were pretreated with SAHA and then treated with TNF in the presence of 1% serum and the SAHA. TNF induced 3.3-fold higher invasive activity, and SAHA suppressed it (Fig. 2A).FIGURE 2SAHA suppresses TNF-induced invasive activity and RANKL-induced osteoclastogenesis. A, H1299 cells (2.5 × 104) were seeded into the upper wells of a Matrigel invasion chamber overnight in the absence of serum, pretreated with 3 μm SAHA for 12 h, treated with 1 nm TNF for 24 h in the presence of 1% serum, and then subjected to invasion assay. The value for no-SAHA and no-TNF was set to 1.0. B, RAW 264.7 cells (1 × 104) were plated overnight, pretreated with 0.3 μm SAHA for 12 h, and then treated with 5 nm RANKL. 4 and 5 days later, cells were stained for tartrate resistance acid phosphatase-positive and evaluated for osteoclastogenesis. Photographs were taken after 5 days of incubation with RANKL.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)SAHA Suppressed RANKL-induced Osteoclastogenesis—It has been shown that RANKL can induce osteoclastogenesis through the activation of NF-κB (32Abu-Amer Y. Tondravi M.M. Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 1189-1190Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 33Dai S. Hirayama T. Abbas S. Abu-Amer Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 37219-37222Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). We examined whether SAHA can suppress RANKL-induced osteoclastogenesis. For this study, we pretreated RAW 264.7 cells with SAHA and then treated them with RANKL for 4 or 5 days. We found that RANKL induced osteoclast differentiation, as indicated by the expression of tartrate resistance acid phosphatase-positive, and that SAHA suppressed it (Fig. 2B).SAHA Repressed TNF-induced NF-κB-dependent Anti-apoptotic Gene Products—We found that SAHA potentiated the apoptotic effects of TNF. Because NF-κB regulates the expression of the anti-apoptotic proteins survivin, inhibitor-of-apoptosis protein 1/2 (IAP1/2), X chromosome-linked IAP, Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, TRAF1, and FLIP (30Kumar A. Takada Y. Boriek A.M. Aggarwal B.B. J. Mol. Med. 2004; 82: 434-448Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we examined whether SAHA can modulate the expression of these anti-apoptotic gene products induced by TNF in KBM-5 cells. The results of Western blot analysis showed that TNF induced these anti-apoptotic proteins in a time-dependent manner and that SAHA suppressed it (Fig. 3A).FIGURE 3SAHA represses TNF-induced NF-κB-dependent expression of anti-apoptosis-, proliferation-, and metastasis-related gene products. SAHA inhibits the expression of TNF-induced anti-apoptotic proteins (A) and of cyclin D1, c-Myc, COX-2, matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9), ICAM-1, and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) (B). KBM-5 cells were incubated with 3 μm SAHA for 12 h and then treated with 1 nm TNF for the indicated times. Whole-cell extracts were prepared and subjected to Western blot analysis using the relevant antibodies.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)SAHA Repressed Expression of TNF-induced NF-κB-dependent Gene Products Involved in Cell Proliferation and Invasion—TNF has been shown to induce ICAM-1, matrix metalloproteinase-9, c-Myc, COX-2, cyclin D1, and vascular endothelial growth factor, which have NF-κB-binding sites in their promoters (30Kumar A. Takada Y. Boriek A.M. Aggarwal B.B. J. Mol. Med. 2004; 82: 434-448Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We pretreated KBM-5 cells with SAHA and treated them with TNF for up to 24 h, and then we prepared whole-cell extracts and analyzed protein expression by Western blot analysis. TNF induced the expression of these proteins in a time-dependent manner, and SAHA suppressed it (Fig. 3B). These results further suggest a role for SAHA in blocking the TNF-induced NF-κB activation pathway.SAHA Blocked NF-κB Activation Induced by IL-1β, Okadaic Acid, Doxorubicin, Lipopolysaccharide, H2O2, PMA, and Cigarette Smoke Condensate—IL-1β, okadaic acid, doxorubicin, lipopolysaccharide, H2O2, PMA, and cigarette smoke condensate are potent activators of NF-κB, but the mechanisms by which these agents activate NF-κB differ (30Kumar A. Takada Y. Boriek A.M. Aggarwal B.B. J. Mol. Med. 2004; 82: 434-448Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We used EMSA to examine the effect of SAHA on the activation of NF-κB by these agents. Pretreatment of KBM-5 cells with SAHA suppressed the activation of NF-κB induced by all agents, including TNF (Fig. 4A). These results suggest that SAHA acts at a step in the NF-κB activation pathway that is common to all eight agents.FIGURE 4A, SAHA blocks NF-κB activation induced by IL-1β, okadaic acid, doxorubicin, lipopolysaccharide, H2O2, PMA, and cigarette smoke condensate. KBM-5 cells were preincubated with 30 μm SAHA for 12 h and then treated with 0.1 nm TNF, 100 ng/ml of IL-1β or 10 μg/ml of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) for 30 min, 50 nm okadaic acid (OA) or 5 μm doxorubicin (Dox) for 4 h, 250 μm H2O2 for 2 h, or 15 μg/ml of phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) or 10 μg/ml of cigarette smoke condensate (CSC) for 1 h. The cells were then analyzed for NF-κB activation by EMSA. B and C, inhibition of NF-κB activation by SAHA is not cell type-specific. SAHA suppresses TNF-induced NF-κB in a dose-dependent manner in KBM-5 cells (B) and H1299 cells (C). Cells were incubated with different concentrations of SAHA for 12 h and then incubated with 0.1 nm TNF for 30 min. Nuclear extracts were then prepared and assayed for NF-κB activation by EMSA. D and E, SAHA inhibits constitutive NF-κB activation. MDA1986 cells (D) and SCC-4 cells (E) were incubated with different concentrations of SAHA for 12 h. Nuclear extracts were then prepared and assayed for NF-κB activation by EMSA.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Inhibition of NF-κB Activation by SAHA Was Not Cell Type-specific—Distinct signal transduction pathways can mediate NF-κB induction in different cell types (34Bonizzi G.

Cell. 2002; 109: S81-S96Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3273) Google Scholar). Because TNF is one of the most potent activators of NF-κB and because the mechanism of activation of NF-κB is relatively well established (20Aggarwal B.B. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2003; 3: 745-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (2112) Google Scholar), we examined the effect of SAHA on TNF-induced NF-κB activation in human myeloid KBM-5 cells (Fig. 4B) and lung adenocarcinoma H1299 cells (Fig. 4C). These cells were pretreated with different concentrations of SAHA, treated with TNF, and subjected to EMSA. TNF activated NF-κB in both cell types, and SAHA strongly inhibited most of this activation. SAHA alone did not activate NF-κB.Whether SAHA could suppress constitutive NF-κB activation was also examined by EMSA. Human squamous cell carcinoma MDA1986 cells and SCC-4 cells are known to express constitutively active NF-κB (36Nakayama H. Ikebe T. Beppu M. Shirasuna K.

In eukaryotes, PII has only been identified in red algae and plants, and in these organisms, PII localizes to the plastid. PII proteins perform their role by assessing cellular carbon, nitrogen, and energy status and conferring this information to other proteins through proteinprotein interaction. We have used affinity chromatography and mass spectrometry to identify the PII-binding proteins of Arabidopsis thaliana. The major PII-interacting protein is the chloroplast-localized enzyme N-acetyl glutamate kinase, which catalyzes the key regulatory step in the pathway to arginine biosynthesis. The interaction of PII with N-acetyl glutamate kinase was confirmed through pull-down, gel filtration, and isothermal titration calorimetry experiments, and binding was shown to be enhanced in the presence of the downstream product, arginine. Enzyme kinetic analysis showed that PII increases N-acetyl glutamate kinase activity slightly, but the primary function of binding is to relieve inhibition of enzyme activity by the pathway product, arginine. Knowing the identity of PII-binding proteins across a spectrum of photosynthetic and non-photosynthetic organisms provides a framework for a more complete understanding of the function of this highly conserved signaling protein.

Nitrogen status is assessed through glutamine levels by covalent modification (uridylylation) of PII. This metabolic information is signaled to other proteins by proteinprotein interaction and produces an appropriate response that alters gene expression and the activity of glutamine synthetase (3Arcondeguy T.

In terms of metabolic sensing, cyanobacterial PII plays a similar role, but in this case, covalent modification is by phosphorylation (6Forchhammer K. Tandeau de Marsac N. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 84-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). To date, the processes known to be regulated by PII in cyanobacteria are: ammonium-dependent nitrate/nitrite uptake (7Lee H.M.

Plant Physiol. 2003; 133: 492-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), and its sequence is highly conserved when compared with prokaryotic PIIs, with Arabidopsis thaliana PII being 50 and 55% identical to E. coli and Synechococcus elongatus PII, respectively. Plant PII proteins have a conserved N-terminal extension that functions as a chloroplast transit peptide, which is consistent with biochemical data indicating that PII resides in this compartment. We have previously shown that the plant PII protein is not regulated by phosphorylation (13Smith C.S. Morrice N.A. Moorhead G.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1699: 145-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Like the bacterial protein, plant PII binds 2-oxoglutarate, but only after binding ATP first, and thus likely functions to sense plastid energy and 2KG status (14Smith C.S. Weljie A.M. Moorhead G.B. Plant J. 2003; 33: 353-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). PII transcripts appear to be present in all plant organs, and PII protein levels do not change during day/night cycles or N-nutrition (14Smith C.S. Weljie A.M. Moorhead G.B. Plant J. 2003; 33: 353-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 15Ferrario-Mery S. Bouvet M. Leleu O. Savino G. Hodges M. Meyer C. Planta. 2005; : 1-12Google Scholar). Although PII T-DNA knock-out lines show increased sensitivity to nitrite and slight alternations in carbon metabolite and amino acid levels during altered N-nutrition (15Ferrario-Mery S. Bouvet M. Leleu O. Savino G. Hodges M. Meyer C. Planta. 2005; : 1-12Google Scholar), no molecular targets have been firmly established for plant PII. Two preliminary yeast two-hybrid studies have indicated that N-acetyl glutamate kinase (NAGK) is a PII interactor in plants (16Burillo S. Luque I. Fuentes I. Contreras A. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 3346-3354Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 17Sugiyama K. Hayakawa T. Kudo T. Ito T. Yamaya T. Plant Cell Physiol. 2004; 45: 1768-1778Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). We searched for PII-interacting proteins by performing affinity chromatography with plant PII and have identified the major PII receptor of A. thaliana as the plastid enzyme N-acetyl glutamate kinase. Biochemical studies showed that PII alters the kinetic properties of NAGK and that the downstream end product of this metabolic pathway (arginine) promotes the interaction of PII and NAGK. Interestingly, arginine levels are barely detectable in plants during the light period and are high during the dark (18Coruzzi G.M. The Arabidopsis Book. American Society of Plant Biologists, Rockville, MD2003https://doi.org/10.1199/tab.0010Crossref Google Scholar), suggesting arginine inhibition of NAGK during the light and relief by PII in the dark. Affinity Chromatography—A. thaliana PII minus the chloroplast transit peptide was expressed and purified as described (19Smith C.S. Zaplachinski S.T. Muench D.G. Moorhead G.B. Protein Expression Purif. 2002; 25: 342-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). After dialysis into PBS, 2 mg of PII and 2 mg of Fraction V BSA (Sigma) were separately coupled to 1 ml of CH-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) by following the manufacturer’s instructions (coupling was >95%). A. thaliana suspension cells were grown in culture, harvested, and lysed as described in Smith et al. (13Smith C.S. Morrice N.A. Moorhead G.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1699: 145-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Typically, ∼300 g of cells were lysed in a French press with 1 volume of 25 mm Tris/Cl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm benzamidine, 0.1 mm PMSF, 0.1% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol, and 1% (w/v) polyvinylpyrrolidone and clarified by centrifugation at 35,000 rpm for 30 min in a Ti-45 rotor. Following filtration through Miracloth (Calbiochem), the crude extract (∼1900 mg of protein) was then split in half and mixed end-over-end at 4 °C with 1 ml of PII or BSA affinity matrix that was previously equilibrated in buffer A (25 mm Tris/Cl, pH 7.5, 1 mm benzamidine and 0.1 mm PMSF). After 4 h, the mixture was poured into a column and washed with 300 ml of buffer A plus 150 mm NaCl, and protein was eluted with 8 ml of buffer A plus 1.5 m NaCl. Eluted protein was concentrated in a Centriprep 10 (Amicon) and then in a Centricon 10 to 25 μl and boiled in SDS-mixture. In all cases, PII- and BSA-Sepharose chromatographies were performed identically to allow direct comparison. Mass Spectrometry and Edman Sequencing—PII- and BSA-binding proteins were run on SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue-stained, and bands were excised, trypsin was digested, and proteins were identified by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry (20Tran H.T. Ulke A. Morrice N. Johannes C.J. Moorhead G.B. Mol. Cell Proteomics. 2004; 3: 257-265Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The only proteins indicated (see Fig. 1A) are those for which a high level of confidence for identification was obtained (see supplementary Table 1). In all cases, the identified protein was the best match to the peptide mass data, the identified protein predicted mass was very near the observed mass on the gel, and the percentage of peptide coverage was high, ranging from 11 to 62% of the total number of residues using a cut-off of less than 35 ppm. For N-terminal sequencing, the PII-Sepharose-eluted proteins were run on SDS-PAGE, blotted to PVM, stained with Amido Black, and washed with water to visualize the 33-kDa protein. This band was excised and submitted to Edman chemistry as described (21Moorhead G. MacKintosh C. Morrice N. Cohen P. FEBS Lett. 1995; 362: 101-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Cloning, Expression, and Purification of A. thaliana N-Acetyl Glutamate Kinase and Non-tagged PII—The N-acetyl glutamate kinase gene was PCR-amplified (to start from the predicted chloroplast cleavage site Ala50) from an A. thaliana silique cDNA library template obtained from the A. thaliana Biological Resource Centre, Ohio State University, using the following primers: 5′-TATAAGATCTCAGCCACCGTATCAACACCAC-3′ and 3′-TATAGAATTCTTATCCAGTAATCATAGTTCCAGC-5′. After digestion with EcoRI and BglII, the PCR product was cloned into EcoRI-BglII-restricted pRSET A plasmid (Invitrogen) to produce a fusion construct that coded for NAGK and a 6-histidine tag on the N terminus with a predicted mass of ∼36 kDa. This construct was transformed into E. coli DH5α cells, and positive transformants were sequenced at the University of Calgary DNA sequencing facility and confirmed to have identical amino acid sequence as A. thaliana NAGK. The resulting plasmid was used for the overexpression of His6-NAGK fusion protein in E. coli Rosetta gami pLysRARE cells (Novagen). The transformed bacterial cells were grown at 37 °C for 26 h. The cells from 1 liter of culture were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in 50 ml of bacterial lysis buffer (25 mm Tris/Cl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm imidazole, pH 7.5, 0.5 mm PMSF, 0.5 mm benzamidine, 5 μg/ml leupeptin). Cells were lysed by two passes through a French pressure cell at 1000 p.s.i., and cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 35,000 rpm for 45 min at 4 °C in a Ti-45 rotor. The soluble recombinant NAGK protein was bound to a 10-ml Ni-NTA agarose (Qiagen) column pre-equilibrated with bacterial lysis buffer. The matrix was washed with 25 mm Tris/Cl, pH 7.5, 1 m NaCl, 30 mm imidazole, pH 7.5, 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20, 0.5 mm PMSF, and 0.5 mm benzamidine. The His6-NAGK protein was eluted with 50 mm Tris/Cl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 300 mm imidazole, pH 7.5, 0.5 mm PMSF, and 0.5 mm benzamidine. Peak fractions were pooled and dialyzed against PBS plus 50% (v/v) glycerol. The purified expressed protein was confirmed to be NAGK by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry as described above. One liter of culture produced ∼45 mg of pure NAGK. A non-tagged PII protein was made by PCR amplification from the plasmid described in Ref. 19Smith C.S. Zaplachinski S.T. Muench D.G. Moorhead G.B. Protein Expression Purif. 2002; 25: 342-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, cloned into the pET3a vector, and after sequence verification, used to transform E. coli Rosetta gami pLys cells. Protein was expressed by growing cells in Terrific broth at 25 °C for 16 h in 0.1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. After harvesting cells and French press lysis as above, the protein was purified by sequential chromatography on Macro-Prep High S matrix (Bio-Rad) and phenyl-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences). One liter of cells yielded 10 mg of pure PII. Reverse Affinity Chromatography—The A. thaliana PII cloned without a tag or transit peptide (32 μg) was mixed with either His6-NAGK (65 μg) or His6-PR65α(65 μg) for 10 min in a total volume of 100 μl with 25 mm Tris/Cl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5% (v/v) glycerol and then mixed with 25 μl of Ni-NTA-agarose end-over-end for 1 h at 4°C. After pelleting, beads were washed two times with 500 μl of PBS, two times with 25 mm Tris/Cl, pH 7.5, 0.05% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, and 20 mm imidazole, and two times again with PBS, and then proteins were released from the matrix by the addition of 0.3 m imidazole, pH 7.5. The following metabolites were included in the incubation mixture to test for their ability to disrupt or enhance the PII-NAGK interaction: Glu, Gln, Asp, ATP, ADP, carbamoyl phosphate, citrulline, and Lys (all at 5 mm), 2KG, AMP, NaNO2 (all at 1 mm), NH4Cl (20 mm), 2KG + ATP (1 and 5 mm, respectively), MgCl2 (10 mm), MgCl2 + ATP (10 and 5 mm, respectively), MgCl2 + ATP (10 and 5 mm, respectively), N-acetyl glutamate (NAG) (20 mm), and Arg (1, 5, 10, and 20 mm). In one series of experiments in which 5 mm arginine was included in the incubation buffer, the same concentration of arginine was included in all wash steps. Antibody Production and Localization of NAGK to Chloroplasts—Recombinant NAGK purified by Ni-NTA-agarose (see Fig. 1B) was used to raise antibodies in a rabbit using standard procedures (19Smith C.S. Zaplachinski S.T. Muench D.G. Moorhead G.B. Protein Expression Purif. 2002; 25: 342-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The antibodies were used in Western blots and immunofluorescence experiments as 5000- and 200-fold diluted crude serum, respectively. For immunological staining of fixed cells, A. thaliana suspension cells were grown as described previously (13Smith C.S. Morrice N.A. Moorhead G.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1699: 145-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), harvested, and allowed to settle by gravity. Once settled, the supernatant was removed, and the cells were fixed by adding a freshly prepared 4% (w/v) formaldehyde solution made in PBS. Cells were fixed for 15 min before being washed with PBS (3× 1 ml). The cell wall was partially digested with 500 μl of a 0.1% (w/v) pectolyase Y-23 (Seishen Pharmaceutical Co.) solution made in PBS for 15 min at 30 °C. The cell membrane was permeabilized by incubation with 1% (v/v) Triton X-100 for 5 min at room temperature. The cells were then washed with PBS (3× 1 ml), blocked in 2% (w/v) BSA in PBS for 10 min, and then incubated overnight at 4 °C in 200-fold diluted crude serum specific for NAGK or PII (14Smith C.S. Weljie A.M. Moorhead G.B. Plant J. 2003; 33: 353-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The following day, the cells were washed with PBS (3× 1 ml) and incubated with anti-mouse secondary antibody conjugated to the fluorophore Alexa Fluor 488 (Molecular Probes) and in blocking buffer for 1 h at room temperature. The samples were washed again in PBS (3× 1 ml) before being analyzed with a fluorescence microscope (Leica DMR) using the fluorescein isothiocyanate filter set. For the observation of chloroplasts, chlorophyll fluorescence was achieved using the UV filter set. Images were captured using a cooled CCD camera (Retiga 1350 EX, Qimaging), and image enhancement and deconvolution confocal algorithm manipulations were performed using the Openlab software package (Version 3.0, Improvision). Pseudocoloration and image manipulation was performed in PhotoShop. Gel Filtration Chromatography—Protein samples were diluted into Superdex 200 column buffer (25 mm Tris/Cl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5% (v/v) glycerol) to a final volume of 45 μl, centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 10 min, passed through a Costar 0.22-μm Spin-X filter, and then chromatographed on a Superdex 200 PC 3.2/30 column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated at room temperature in column buffer. The fast protein liquid chromatography flow rate was 0.40 μl/min, and 0.10-ml fractions were collected. For experiments that included Mg-ADP, the sample was made 2 mm MgCl2 and 1 mm ADP and chromatographed in column buffer that included 0.4 mm MgCl2 and 0.2 mm ADP. The Superdex 200 PC 3.2/30 column was calibrated from a standard plot of Kav versus molecular mass for ribonuclease A (13.7 kDa), ovalbumin (43 kDa), bovine serum albumin (66 kDa), aldolase (158 kDa), catalase (232 kDa), ferritin (440 kDa), thyroglobulin (669 kDa), and blue dextran (void). The mass of NAGK (n = 5), His6-PII (n = 7) and the NAGK-His6-PII complex (n = 3) was determined and is presented as the mean ± S.E. Isothermal Titration Calorimetry—ITC experiments were performed as described in Smith et al. (14Smith C.S. Weljie A.M. Moorhead G.B. Plant J. 2003; 33: 353-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) using His6-NAGK and His6-PII without transit peptides, in the following: 25 mm Tris/Cl, pH 7.5, 5% (v/v) glycerol, and 150 mm NaCl. Each run was corrected for heat of dilution. Enzyme Kinetics—For enzyme kinetics, all assays were done in duplicate in three or more separate experiments, except in the assays where Km and Vmax values were examined for arginine-inhibited NAGK, plus and minus PII. Here, each assay was done in triplicate. NAGK activity assays with purified proteins were determined as described by Heinrich et al. (11Heinrich A. Maheswaran M. Ruppert U. Forchhammer K. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 52: 1303-1314Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Unless stated otherwise, the reaction mixture consisted of 300 mm NH2OH · HCl, pH 7.5, 20 mm Tris/Cl, pH 7.5, 20 mm MgCl2,40mm NAG, and 10 mm ATP and NAGK diluted into 25 mm Tris/Cl, pH 7.5, and 150 mm NaCl such that each assay contained 0.81 μg of enzyme. Reactions were initiated by the addition of reaction mixture, and the incubation was carried out at 37 °C in a volume of 0.10 ml and terminated after 20 min by the addition of 0.1 ml of stop mixture (1:1:1 of 5% (w/v) FeCl3 · 6H2Oin0.2 m HCl, 8% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid, and 0.3 m HCl), and after standing for 5 min at room temperature, the tubes were centrifuged for 1 min at 14,000 rpm. Under these reaction conditions, the assay was linear up to at least 30 min. Blank reactions were performed by omitting N-acetyl glutamate from the assay. One unit of enzyme activity is defined as one mmol of product produced in 1 min calculated with a molar absorption coefficient of 456 m-1 cm-1 at 540 nm for the N-acetylglutamylhydroxamate-Fe3+ complex. The non-linear regression program GraphPadPrism 4.0 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA) was used for estimating the Km and Vmax values for all data except the data obtained from arginine inhibition. The catalytic efficiency and kcat of NAGK were calculated using Kcat/Km and Vmax/[NAGK]total, respectively. The Vmax and Km values for NAGK were determined by holding the concentration of the second substrate at a saturating level (NAG at 40 mm or ATP 10 mm (MgCl2 at 20 mm)). The varied substrate was omitted when carrying out blank assays. To study the effect of PII on the activity of NAGK, various amounts of A. thaliana PII (14Smith C.S. Weljie A.M. Moorhead G.B. Plant J. 2003; 33: 353-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) were added into the diluted NAGK fraction, and the mixture was placed at 4 °C for 10 min to allow complex formation. The reaction was initiated by the addition of the reaction mixture into the NAGK-PII complex mixture. For determining the effect of PII on the Km and Vmax for NAG and ATP, PII was added into the diluted NAGK such that the molar ratio of PII-polypeptide to NAGK-polypeptide was 2:1 (based on a Bradford assay with BSA as standard) and allowed to interact at 4 °C for 10 min. For studying the NAGK activity in the presence of PII and its effect or 2KG, PII was incubated with 5 mm ATP and 1 mm 2KG for 3 min at 4 °C followed by the addition of NAGK. For studying the Km and Vmax of NAGK for the substrate ATP, PII was preincubated with 0.05 mm ATP and 1 mm 2KG. The effect of arginine on NAGK was studied under saturating substrate conditions (10 mm ATP and 40 mm NAG). The effect of arginine was also studied at Km conditions in which the concentration of NAG was set to 40 mm and the concentration of ATP was set to the Km value (1.74 mm). For either condition, various amounts of arginine were added into the NAGK fraction, and the mixture was allowed to stand for 5 min before initiating the reaction by adding substrates. The Km and Vmax values for NAGK in which NAG was the varied substrate were studied under three different concentrations of arginine, 0.16, 0.32 and 0.64 mm. Hill plots, with the equation log [Vo/(Vn-Vo)] = N log [NAG]0-log K′, were performed for each set of data. The Vmax values were estimated from Eadie-Hofstee plots, and the Km values were estimated from plots of velocity versus substrate concentration. To test the effect of arginine on the PII-NAGK complex, PII was first added into the diluted NAGK solution, and the two proteins were placed at 4 °C for 10 min to allow complex formation followed by the addition of arginine. The enzyme mixture was allowed to stand for 5 min before the initiation of assays. Identification of A. thaliana PII-binding Proteins—To identify PII-binding proteins, an extract from A. thaliana was incubated with PII coupled to Sepharose beads. After extensive washing, bound proteins were eluted with 1.5 m NaCl and run on SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1A). No proteins were eluted from the control matrix (BSA-Sepharose), whereas several proteins were consistently enriched on the PII matrix. The eluted proteins were identified by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry and are indicated on the gel (Fig. 1A, and see also Supplemental Table 1). The major PII-binding protein of 33 kDa was identified as a putative plastid N-acetyl glutamate kinase (gi 15230338). Other minor bound proteins were the cytosolic α, β, β′, and γ subunits of the coatomer protein complex I vesicle coat protein complex and several of the smaller cytosolic 60 S ribosomal proteins. ChloroP analysis (ChloroP 1.1 Server) of the NAGK sequence predicts that this gene product is chloroplast-localized, and cleavage of the chloroplast transit peptide is between Lys49 and Ala50 likely, yielding a protein of 31.1 kDa. Edman sequencing of the PII-purified NAGK yielded the sequence 51TVSTPPSI58. This confirmed that mature NAGK has its putative chloroplast transit peptide cleaved, but between Ala50 and Thr-51, and thus likely localizes to the chloroplast. This is consistent with the expected localization of a PII-interacting protein. Being the most abundant PII-binding protein and likely residing in the same compartment, we further characterized the interaction of PII and NAGK. A. thaliana NAGK was cloned minus the chloroplast transit peptide, expressed in E. coli as a 6-histidine fusion protein, and purified (Fig. 1B). NAGK and PII Are Chloroplast-localized Proteins—The chloroplast localization of NAGK and PII was confirmed by immunolocalization experiments using antibodies raised against each protein. The NAGK antibody was first tested by probing Western blots of pure enzyme and an A. thaliana crude fraction. The diluted crude serum could easily detect less than 1 ng of recombinant NAGK and one major band of 33 kDa in a crude extract (data not shown). Both PII and NAGK stained in small structures that resemble chloroplasts and were subsequently colocalized with chlorophyll fluorescence (Fig. 2). The immunolocalization of PII and NAGK to the chloroplast is consistent with previous biochemical studies of A. thaliana PII (22Hsieh M.H. Lam H.M. van de Loo F.J. Coruzzi G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13965-13970Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar) and the predicted chloroplast transit peptides of both PII and NAGK. Reverse Affinity and Gel Filtration Chromatography Confirms an Interaction between PII and NAGK—Knowing that PII and NAGK localize to the same compartment supports the idea that they are true interacting partners. To further confirm an interaction between PII and NAGK, we performed the reverse experiment in which His-tagged NAGK was incubated with non-tagged PII and the complex was pulled out with Ni-NTA-beads. Fig. 3A shows that NAGK binds PII and that PII in the presence of an unrelated His-tagged protein (PR65) is not retained on the beads, nor is non-tagged PII retained on the beads alone (data not shown). The mass of the A. thaliana purified NAGK was determined by gel filtration chromatography after elution from the PII matrix. Peak fractions demonstrated a mass of ∼215 kDa (Fig. 3B). This 33-kDa band was confirmed to be NAGK by Western blot analysis (data not shown) and suggests that the native protein exists as a multimer of six or seven 33-kDa subunits. Fig. 3, C-F, show the elution profiles for recombinant PII alone, NAGK alone, and a mixture of PII plus excess NAGK. Tagged PII displayed a mass of ∼45 ± 0.5 kDa (14Smith C.S. Weljie A.M. Moorhead G.B. Plant J. 2003; 33: 353-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), which is consistent with a mass of a trimer of 16-kDa subunits, whereas recombinant NAGK eluted at ∼276 ± 2 kDa, which is consistent with a multimer of six or seven 33-kDa subunits (the recombinant protein contains a tag of ∼5 kDa in addition to the native protein). If the recombinant protein exists as a hexamer, subtracting six tags gives a mass similar to the native protein, giving us confidence that the bacterial produced protein is behaving like the purified plastid enzyme. When the two proteins are mixed (Fig. 3, E and F), the PII elution profile shifts dramatically, suggesting that PII and NAGK form a complex that displays a mass of ∼300 ± 1.5 kDa. PII and NAGK chromatographed in the presence of 0.4 mm MgCl2 and 0.2 mm ADP displayed the same mass (data not shown). Isothermal Titration Calorimetry—ITC allowed us to further address the stoichiometry of binding for PII and NAGK. Titration of PII into a solution of NAGK (Fig. 4) gives an n value of 0.43, suggesting that each PII trimer binds ∼7 NAGK subunits. In the reverse experiment, in which NAGK was titrated into a solution of PII, n = 1.77, suggesting that about five NAGK molecules interact with each PII trimer. In combination with the gel filtration data, this supports the idea that one PII trimer interacts with one NAGK hexamer and that native NAGK is indeed a hexamer. Altered Kinetic Behavior of NAGK in the Presence of PII and Its Effector Molecule 2KG—NAGK catalyzes the second step in the arginine biosynthetic pathway (see Supplemental Fig. 1). The reaction catalyzed by NAGK involves two substrates, ATP and NAG, in which NAGK transfers the γ-phosphate group from ATP to NAG to form N-acetyl-γ-glutamyl phosphate. For free NAGK (not complexed with PII), the apparent Vmax and Km obtained when NAG was the variable substrate was 10.6 (±0.3 S.E.) units/mg and 7.08 (±0.49 S.E.) mm, respectively, yielding a catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km) of 872 s-1m-1. For ATP, the apparent Km of 1.74 (±0.21 S.E.) mm and Vmax of 9.99 (±0.29 S.E.) units/mg yields a catalytic efficiency of 3350 s-1m-1. The plot of velocity versus substrate concentration for NAG (Fig. 5A) displayed a classic Michaelis-Menten kinetic profile (a Michaelis-Menten profile was obtained for ATP as well). As shown in Fig. 5B, the V"
https://openalex.org/W2051143932,"Matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) inhibitory proteins may negatively regulate MMP activity to suppress tumor metastasis. In this study, we demonstrate that the HER-2/neu oncogene inhibits the expression of the MMP inhibitor RECK to promote cell invasion. RECK was inhibited via transcriptional repression in B104-1-1 cells, which express constitutively active HER-2/neu. Overexpression of HER-2/neu in NIH/3T3 or HaCaT cells also suppressed RECK expression. Deletion and mutation assays showed that HER-2/neu repressed RECK via the Sp1-binding site localized in the –82/–71 region from the translational start site. DNA affinity precipitation and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays indicated that binding of Sp1 and Sp3 to this consensus site was increased in B104-1-1 cells. We also found that HER-2/neu inhibited RECK via the ERK signaling pathway. Sp1 proteins phosphorylated at Thr453 and Thr739 by ERK bound preferentially to the RECK promoter, and this binding was reversed by HER-2/neu and ERK inhibitors. Furthermore, our data indicate that HER-2/neu obviously increased HDAC1 binding to the Sp1-binding site localized in the –82/–71 region of the RECK promoter. The histone deacetylase inhibitor trichostatin A reversed HER-2/neu-induced inhibition of RECK. HER-2/neu activation was associated with increased MMP-9 secretion and activation. Re-expression of RECK in HER-2/neu-overexpressing cells inhibited MMP-9 secretion and cell invasion. Taken together, our results suggest that HER-2/neu induces the binding of Sp proteins and HDAC1 to the RECK promoter to inhibit RECK expression and to promote cell invasion.

Restoration of RECK provides a novel strategy for the inhibition of HER-2/neu-induced metastasis. The HER-2/neu oncogene (also known as erbB2) encodes a transmembrane glycoprotein that belongs to the human epidermal growth factor receptor family (1Drebin J.A. Link V.C. Stern D.F. Weinberg R.A. Greene M.I. Cell. 1985; 41: 697-706Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar, 2Stern D.F. Heffernan P.A. Weinberg R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 1729-1740Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Structural analysis of HER-2/neu and the epidermal growth factor receptor revealed significant sequence homology and identical gross structural organization between these two proteins (3Bargmann C.I. Hung M.C. Weinberg R.A. Nature. 1986; 319: 226-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (934) Google Scholar, 4Dougall W.C. Qian X. Greene M.I. J. Cell.

Amplification and overexpression of HER-2/neu have been found in breast, ovarian, lung, gastric, and cervical carcinomas (6Varley J.M. Swallow J.E. Brammar W.J. Whittaker J.L. Walker R.A.

Up-regulation of this oncogene is frequently linked with increased metastasis and poor prognosis. The mechanism underlying HER-2/neu-induced metastasis is a field of intensive study, and several candidates involved in this process have been identified recently. The first candidate is the vascular endothelial growth factor. HER-2/neu may stimulate vascular endothelial growth factor expression, and neutralizing antibody against HER-2/neu suppresses vascular endothelial growth factor production and metastasis of cancer cells (11Laughner E. Taghavi P. Chiles K. Mahon P.C. Semenza G.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 3995-4004Crossref PubMed Scopus (1133) Google Scholar, 12Petit A.M. Rak J. Hung M.C. Rockwell P. Goldstein N. Fendly B. Kerbel R.S. Am. J. Pathol. 1997; 151: 1523-1530PubMed Google Scholar). The second is the urokinase-type plasminogen activator. Induction of the urokinase-type plasminogen activator by HER-2/neu has been shown to be correlated with increased metastasis (13Konecny G. Untch M. Arboleda J. Wilson C. Kahlert S. Boettcher B. Felber M. Beryt M. Lude S. Hepp H. Slamon D. Pegram M. Clin. Cancer Res. 2001; 7: 2448-2457PubMed Google Scholar). The third is cyclooxygenase-2. Cyclooxygenase-2 plays a critical role in tumor metastasis and may be a potential target for chemoprevention (14Vadlamudi R. Mandal M. Adam L. Steinbach G. Mendelsohn J. Kumar R. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 305-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). HER-2/neu up-regulates cyclooxygenase-2 through transcriptional activation, and the selective cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor celecoxib has been shown to protect HER-2/neu-induced breast cancer (15Subbaramaiah K.

Another important mediator for tumor metastasis triggered by HER-2/neu is the chemokine receptor CXCR4. A recent study has shown that HER-2/neu enhances the expression of CXCR4, which is required for HER-2/neu-mediated invasion in vitro and lung metastasis in vivo (17Li Y.M. Pan Y. Wei Y. Cheng X.

Finally, recent studies have shown that matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) 2The abbreviations used are: MMPs, matrix metalloproteinases; RT, reverse transcription; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; DAPA, DNA affinity precipitation assay; ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation; MEK1, mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase-1; TSA, trichostatin A. are key players in the induction of tumor metastasis by HER-2/neu. HER-2/neu directly up-regulates MMP expression via ETS transcription factor-binding sites (18La Rocca G. Pucci-Minafra I. Marrazzo A. Taormina P. Minafra S. Br. J.

Although RECK mRNA is expressed in most normal human tissues and untransformed cells, it is undetectable in many tumor cell lines (23Sasahara R.M. Takahashi C. Noda M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 264: 668-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Additionally, clinical studies have also indicated that patients with high RECK expression in tumor tissues show better survival and that such tumors are less invasive (24Furumoto K. Arii S. Mori A.

These results strongly suggest that RECK is a novel suppressor gene for metastasis and angiogenesis. In this study, we investigate whether HER-2/neu may suppress RECK expression to promote cell invasion. Cell Culture and Experimental Reagents—NIH/3T3 and B104-1-1 (NIH/3T3 cells expressing constitutively active HER-2/neu) cells (26Hung M.C. Yan D.H. Zhao X.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chen (National Taiwan University). Cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium/nutrient mixture F-12 containing 10% fetal calf serum and antibiotics. A luciferase assay system was purchased from Promega Corp. (Madison, WI). The expression vector for constitutively active HER-2/neu was kindly provided by Dr. M. C. Hung (M. D. Anderson Cancer Center). The mouse Reck promoter-luciferase plasmid and human RECK cDNA were kindly provided by Dr. M. Noda (Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan). The p21WAF1 promoter-luciferase construct was kindly provided by Dr. B. Vogelstein. The OneStep reverse transcription (RT)-PCR kit was from Qiagen Inc. The kinase inhibitor AG825, PD98059, and wortmannin were from Tocris (Northpoint, United Kingdom). Anti-phospho-AKT and anti-phospho-ERK antibodies were purchased from New England Biolabs. Anti-phospho-Sp1 antibodies were kindly provided by Dr. G. Pages. Construction of the RECK Expression Vector—Human RECK cDNA in the pBluescript II vector was digested with SalI and NotI restriction enzymes and subcloned into the pBK-CMV vector (Stratagene). RNA Extraction and RT-PCR—Total RNA was isolated from cells, and RECK expression was investigated using the OneStep RT-PCR kit according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) was used as an internal control to check the efficiency of cDNA synthesis and PCR amplification. cDNA synthesis was carried out at 50 °C for 30 min, and the PCR conditions were as follows: 30 cycles of denaturation at 94 °C for 1 min, annealing at 60 °C for 1 min, and extension at 72 °C for 1 min and one cycle of final extension at 72 °C for 10 min. The predicted sizes of the PCR products for RECK and GAPDH were 477 and 512 bp, respectively. The primers used were as follows: RECK-forward, 5′-CCTCAGTGAGCACAGTTCAGA-3′; RECK-reverse, 5′-GCAGCACACACACTGCTGTA-3′; GAPDH-forward, 5′-GAGTCAACGGATTTGGTCGT-3′; and GAPDH-reverse, 5′-TGTGGTCATGAGTCCTTCCA-3′. After the reaction, PCR products were separated on a 0.5× Tris borate/EDTA-containing 2% agarose gel, stained with ethidium bromide, and visualized under UV light. Western Blot Analysis—Cells were harvested in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaF, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mg/ml aprotinin, 2 μg/ml pepstatin A, and 2 μg/ml leupeptin), 1% SDS, 10 mm EDTA, and 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, and an equal amount of cellular proteins was subjected to SDS-PAGE as described previously (27Pan M.R. Hung W.-C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 32775-32780Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and the blots were probed with various primary antibodies. Enhanced chemiluminescence reagents were used to depict the protein bands on the membranes. Promoter Activity Assay—The promoter activity of the RECK gene was analyzed as described previously (28Liu L.T. Chang H.-C. Chiang L.C. Hung W.-C. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 3069-3072PubMed Google Scholar). In brief, cells were plated onto 6-well plates at a density of 100,000 cells/well and grown overnight. Cells were cotransfected with 2 μg of mouse full-length Reck promoterluciferase vector and 1 μg of pCMV-β-gal plasmid. After transfection, cells were cultured in 10% fetal calf serum medium for 48 h, and luciferase activity was determined using the luciferase assay system as recommended by Promega Corp. and was normalized for β-galactosidase activity. In some experiments, transfected cells were cultured in the absence or presence of different kinase inhibitors for 48 h, and RECK promoter activity was determined. Drosophila SL2 cells (provided by Dr. W. C. Chang, National Cheng Kung University) were grown in Schneider’s Drosophila medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum at room temperature in air. Cells were transfected using Effectene reagent (Qiagen Inc.). DNA Affinity Precipitation Assay (DAPA) and Immunoprecipitation—We used a biotinylated DNA probe for interaction with nuclear proteins and precipitated the DNA-protein complex with streptavidin-coated agarose beads. After centrifugation, the beads were collected and washed, and proteins were eluted with SDS-PAGE sample buffer. The binding proteins were separated on 7.5 or 12% polyacrylamide gels and analyzed by Western blotting. The sequence of the DNA probe used was 5′-GCGCGGGGGGCGGGGCCTGGTGCC-3′, corresponding to the Sp1-binding site localized in the –82/–71 region from the translational start site, originally designed as Sp1(B) in the study of Sasahara et al. (23Sasahara R.M. Takahashi C. Noda M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 264: 668-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). To verify the specificity of binding, we also synthesized a mutant DNA probe with the sequence 5′-GCGCGGGGTTCGGGGCCTGGTGCC-3′, in which GG was mutated to TT as indicated in boldface. DAPAs were performed according to the procedures described previously (29Huang Y.C. Chen J.Y. Hung W.-C. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 4856-4861Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). To investigate the phosphorylation status of Sp1 bound to the DNA probes, Sp1 was eluted from the DNA-protein complex in elution buffer (62 mm Tris-HCl, 2 mm EDTA, 2% SDS, and 5% dithiothreitol, pH 6.9). Samples were diluted 1:9 (v/v) in dilution buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 190 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, and 0.5% Triton X-100, pH 7.4) and subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-Sp1 antibody. The Sp1 protein was separated by SDS-PAGE and probed with anti-phospho-Sp1 antibodies (against Thr453 and Thr739, respectively). Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) Assay—NIH/3T3 and B104-1-1 cells were fixed in 1% formaldehyde at 37 °C for 10 min. Cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline containing protease inhibitors (1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 μg/ml pepstatin A), scraped, and pelleted by centrifugation at 4 °C. Cells were resuspended in lysis buffer, incubated for 10 min on ice, and sonicated to shear DNA. After sonication, the lysate was centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was diluted in ChIP dilution buffer (0.01% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, 16.7 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, 167 mm NaCl, and protease inhibitors). Anti-Sp1, anti-Sp3, and anti-HDAC1 antibodies were added to the supernatant and incubated overnight at 4 °C with rotation. The immunocomplex was collected on protein A/G-agarose and washed sequentially with low salt wash buffer (0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, 200 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, and 150 mm NaCl), high salt wash buffer (0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, 200 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, and 500 mm NaCl), LiCl wash buffer (0.25 m LiCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% deoxycholate, 1 mm EDTA, and 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1), and finally 1× Tris/EDTA buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl and 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0). The immunocomplex was eluted with elution buffer (1% SDS, 0.1 m NaHCO3, and 200 mm NaCl), and the cross-links were reversed by heating at 65 °C for 4 h. After the reaction, the samples were adjusted to 10 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.5, and 40 μg/ml proteinase K and incubated at 45 °C for 1 h. DNA was recovered and subjected to PCR amplification using the primers specific for the detection of the –107/+52 region, which contains the Sp1(B) site of the RECK promoter. The primers used were as follows: sense, 5′-GAACCGAGAGACCACTAACC-3′; and antisense, 5′-GACGATGAAGACGACCGGC-3′. The predicted size of the PCR product was 159 bp. In Vitro Invasion Assay and MMP-9 Secretion—The in vitro invasion assay was performed using 24-well Transwell units with polycarbonate filters (8-μm pore size) coated on the upper side with Matrigel (BD Biosciences). Cells were transfected with the control or RECK expression vector for 48 h. Cells were collected, and 5 × 103 cells in 100 μlof medium were placed in the upper part of the Transwell unit and allowed to invade for 24 h. The lower part of the Transwell unit was filled with 10% fetal calf serum medium. After incubation, non-invaded cells on the upper part of the membrane were removed with a cotton swab. Invaded cells on the bottom surface of the membrane were fixed in formaldehyde, stained with Giemsa solution, and counted under a microscope. The medium from the same number of control or RECK vector-transfected cells was collected and subjected to Western blot analysis to detect pro-MMP-9 and MMP-9. HER-2/neu Down-regulates RECK via Transcriptional Repression—We first compared the RECK protein level in NIH/3T3 and B104-1-1 cells. We found that the amount of RECK protein was dramatically reduced in B104-1-1 cells (Fig. 1A). RT-PCR analysis showed a 70 – 80% reduction of the RECK mRNA level in B104-1-1 cells (Fig. 1B). These results suggested that HER-2/neu suppresses RECK expression via transcriptional repression. We next performed a promoter activity assay to verify this issue. The mouse Reck promoter-luciferase construct was transfected into both cell lines, and we found that RECK promoter activity was significantly inhibited in B104-1-1 cells (Fig. 1C). Repression of RECK by HER-2/neu is specific because p21WAF1 promoter activity was not affected under the same experimental conditions (Fig. 1C). To rule out that this reduction may be due to the difference in transfection efficiency between these two cell lines, the Reck promoter-luciferase construct was cotransfected with the constitutively active HER-2/neu or control vector into NIH/3T3 cells, and promoter activity was assayed. Fig. 1D shows that the overexpression of HER-2/neu inhibited RECK promoter activity by 70 – 80% in NIH/3T3 cells. To clarify whether a similar inhibition can also be observed in epithelial cells, we tested the effect of HER-2/neu on RECK expression in human HaCaT keratinocyte cells. Fig. 2A demonstrates that transfection of the HER-2/neu expression vector obviously increased this oncoprotein in NIH/3T3 cells and that HER-2/neu effectively suppressed RECK mRNA expression. The promoter activity assay suggested that HER-2/neu repressed RECK transcription (Fig. 2B). Collectively, we conclude that HER-2/neu inhibits RECK at the transcriptional level. HER-2/neu Inhibits RECK via the Sp1-binding Site—We next investigated the critical elements that mediate the inhibitory effect of HER-2/neu on RECK promoter activity using deletion mutants. Fig. 3A demonstrates that the element responsive to HER-2/neu is located within the region –159 bp from the translational start site. Two potential Sp1-binding sites are found in this region; we used mutation mutants to address the importance of these Sp1 sites in the repression of RECK by HER-2/neu. As shown in Fig. 3B, mutation of the Sp1(B) site (localized in the –82/–71 region from the translational start site) up-regulated RECK basal promoter activity, so this Sp1-binding site functions as a transcriptional repressor. Additionally, HER-2/neu-induced inhibition of RECK was obviously attenuated after mutation of the Sp1(B) site. In contrast, mutation of the Sp1(A) site had little effect. We next performed DAPA to study the interaction between nuclear proteins and this consensus site. Fig. 4A shows minor increases in the levels of the nuclear Sp1 and Sp3 proteins (but not CDK4) in B104-1-1 cells. Western blot analysis indicated that the Sp1 and Sp3 protein levels were not significantly altered in B104-1-1 cells (Fig. 4B). In addition, RT-PCR data also showed that Sp1 and Sp3 mRNA levels were similar in NIH/3T3 and B104-1-1 cells (Fig. 4C). These results suggest that HER-2/neu increases Sp1 and Sp3 nuclear accumulation. DAPA demonstrated that binding of Sp1 and Sp3 to the DNA probe was increased in B104-1-1 cells (Fig. 4D), indicating that HER-2/neu activation potently stimulated the DNA binding affinity of Sp1 and Sp3. The binding between Sp1 and Sp3 to the DNA probe is specific because mutation of the Sp1-binding site obviously attenuated the interaction (Fig. 4D). This result is in agreement with the data of two previous studies demonstrating that HER-2/neu may increase the phosphorylation and DNA binding activity of Sp1 and Sp3 (30Alroy I. Soussan L. Seger R. Yarden Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1961-1972Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 31Finkenzeller G. Wiendel K. Zimmermann W. Westin G. Marme D. Angiogenesis. 2004; 7: 59-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). To verify that the Sp1 proteins bound to the Sp1-binding site of the DNA probe were in the phosphorylated form, we performed DAPA to precipitate the Sp1 proteins and investigated the phosphorylation status of Sp1 by immunoprecipitation/immunoblot assay after releasing the Sp1 proteins from the DNA probe. Previous studies have shown that ERKs, a major downstream mediator of the HER-2/neu signaling pathway, might phosphorylate Thr453 and Thr739 of the Sp1 protein to enhance its DNA binding and transcriptional activity (32Harris V.K.

Pouyssegur J. Pages G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 20631-20639Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Therefore, we probed the immunoprecipitated Sp1 protein with anti-phospho-Sp1 antibodies against these two phosphothreonine residues. As demonstrated in Fig. 4E, the Sp1 proteins bound to the DNA probe were mainly in the phosphorylated form, and phosphorylation at Thr453 and Thr739 was obviously increased in B104-1-1 cells. We next studied whether Sp1 and Sp3 bind to the RECK promoter in vivo using the ChIP assay. Fig. 4F shows that Sp1 and Sp3 indeed bound to the RECK promoter in vivo. Conversely, precipitation with the unrelated anti-p57Kip2 antibody (negative control) did not yield any PCR products under the same experimental conditions.FIGURE 4Sp1 and Sp3 bind to the RECK promoter in vitro and in vivo. A, the nuclear protein levels of Sp1 and Sp3 in NIH/3T3 (N) and B104-1-1 (B) cells were analyzed by Western blot analysis. CDK4 was used as an internal control to verify equal loading of each sample. B, total cell lysates were prepared from NIH/3T3 and B104-1-1 cells, and the Sp1 and Sp3 protein levels were examined. C, total RNA was harvested, and the mRNA levels of Sp1 and Sp3 were investigated by RT-PCR. GAPDH was included as an internal control to check the efficiency of cDNA synthesis and PCR amplification. D, the biotinylated wild-type or mutant (Mut) DNA probe corresponding to the Sp1-binding site localized in the –82/–71 region from the translational start site of the RECK gene was used for interaction with nuclear proteins, and the DNA-protein complex was precipitated by streptavidin-coated beads. The amounts of Sp1 and Sp3 proteins bound to the probe were analyzed by Western blot analysis. E, the phosphorylation status of Sp1 bound to the DNA probe was investigated. Proteins precipitated by the probe were eluted and subjected to immunoprecipitation (IP) by anti-Sp1 antibody. The phosphorylation of the Sp1 protein at Thr453 and Thr739 was then studied using phospho-specific antibodies against these two residues. F, cells were fixed in 1% formaldehyde, washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline containing protease inhibitors, and pelleted by centrifugation at 4 °C. Cells were resuspended in lysis buffer and sonicated to shear DNA. Anti-Sp1 and anti-Sp3 antibodies were added to precipitate the DNA-protein complex. Anti-p57Kip2 antibody was used as a negative control. DNA was recovered and subjected to PCR amplification using the primers specific for the detection of the –107/+52 region, which contains the Sp1(B) site of the RECK promoter.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The ERK Signaling Pathway Is Involved in the Inhibition of RECK by HER-2/neu—We next tested the signaling pathways by which HER-2/neu suppresses RECK. ERK and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase are the major mediators of HER-2/neu, so we tested the involvement of these two kinases. B104-1-1 cells were transfected with the Reck promoterluciferase plasmid and incubated with different kinase inhibitors, AG825 (50 μm) for HER-2/neu, PD98059 (10 μm) for MEK1, and wortmannin (200 nm) for phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, for 48 h. As shown in Fig. 5A, the HER-2/neu kinase inhibitor AG825 completely suppressed ERK activity and reversed HER-2/neu-induced repression of RECK. The MEK1 inhibitor PD98059 also effectively inhibited ERK activity and counteracted the inhibition of RECK by HER-2/neu. Conversely, the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor had little effect. Because our results suggested that HER-2/neu increases Sp1 and Sp3 binding to the RECK promoter to inhibit gene expression, we investigated whether AG825 and PD98059 could reverse the binding of Sp1 and Sp3 to the RECK promoter using ChIP assays. Fig. 5B clearly demonstrates that these two kinase inhibitors attenuated the binding of Sp1 and Sp3 to the RECK promoter in vivo. These data suggest that HER-2/neu induces ERK activation and subsequently increases Sp protein phosphorylation and binding to the RECK promoter to repress gene expression. We also used SL2 cells (Drosophila cells that lack endogenous Sp proteins) to verify the importance of Sp proteins in the suppression of RECK by HER-2/neu. As shown in Fig. 6, the expression of HER-2/neu in SL2 cells could not repress RECK promoter activity.FIGURE 6Effect of HER-2/neu on RECK promoter activity in SL2 cells. SL2 cells were cotransfected with the RECK promoter-luciferase construct and the control (C) or HER-2/neu (Neu) expression vector for 48 h, and luciferase activity was assayed.

Western blot analysis showed a minor increase in nuclear HDAC1 in B104-1-1 cells (Fig. 7A). However, total cellular HDAC1 protein and mRNA levels were not significantly changed (Fig. 7, B and C).

https://openalex.org/W2053824115,"The role of inflammation and oxidative stress in the development of obesity and associated metabolic disorders is under debate. We investigated the redox metabolism in a non-diabetic obesity model, i.e. 11-week-old obese Zucker rats. Antioxidant enzyme activities, lipophilic antioxidant (α-tocopherol, coenzymes Q) and hydrophilic antioxidant (glutathione, vitamin C) contents and their redox state (% oxidized form), were studied in inguinal white fat and compared with blood and liver. The adipose tissues of obese animals showed a specific higher content of hydrophilic molecules in a lower redox state than those of lean animals, which were associated with lower lipophilic molecule content and lipid peroxidation. Conversely and as expected, glutathione content decreased and its redox state increased in adipose tissues of rats subjected to lipopolysaccharide-induced systemic oxidative stress. In these in vivo models, oxidative stress and obesity thus had opposite effects on adipose tissue redox state. Moreover, the increase in glutathione content and the decrease of its redox state by antioxidant treatment promoted in vitro the accumulation of triglycerides in preadipocytes. Taken together and contrary to the emergent view, our results suggest that obesity is associated with an intracellular reduced redox state that promotes on its own the development of a deleterious proadipogenic process.

Redox metabolism corresponds to a complex interacting network involving the generation of reactive oxygen species and enzymatic and non-enzymatic cellular antioxidant defenses. Any small and transient disturbance of this balance induces redox signaling, which can act on several transduction pathways or enzyme and transcription factor activities. In contrast, when antioxidant defenses are chronically overwhelmed, the result is an oxidative stress in which free radicals may exert their deleterious effects (1Dröge W. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 47-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (7276) Google Scholar). Oxidative stress has been implicated in the pathogenesis of several metabolic diseases as well as in the co-morbidity of diabetes mellitus and atherosclerosis. In such studies, redox metabolism was evaluated by the pattern of various parameters such as manganese-dependent superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase or catalase activities, and glutathione or α-tocopherol content in blood and liver (2Touyz R.M. Schiffrin E.L. Histochem. Cell Biol. 2004; 122: 339-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar, 3Faure P. Ramon O. Favier A. Halimi S. Eur. J. Clin.

A similar pattern was observed in obesity and seemed to indicate that such pathology was related to pro-oxidative context. Indeed, obesity prevalence is correlated with decreased concentrations of plasma antioxidants (6Reitman A. Friedrich I. Ben-Amotz A. Levy Y. Isr. Med. Assoc. J. 2002; 4: 590-593PubMed Google Scholar). An increase in the markers of systemic oxidative stress has therefore been associated with obesity and metabolic syndrome (7Furukawa S. Fujita T.

Furthermore, it has been suggested that oxidative stress in accumulated fat, assessed by H202 generation and malondialdehyde (MDA), 2The abbreviations used are: MDA, malondialdehyde; IW, inguinal white adipose tissue; EW, epididymal white adipose tissue; Gpx, glutathione peroxidase; SOD, superoxide dismutase; VitC, vitamin C; CoQ, coenzyme Q; αToc, α-tocopherol; LPS, lipopolysaccharide; SVF, stroma vascular fraction; BHA, butylhydroxyanisole. 2The abbreviations used are: MDA, malondialdehyde; IW, inguinal white adipose tissue; EW, epididymal white adipose tissue; Gpx, glutathione peroxidase; SOD, superoxide dismutase; VitC, vitamin C; CoQ, coenzyme Q; αToc, α-tocopherol; LPS, lipopolysaccharide; SVF, stroma vascular fraction; BHA, butylhydroxyanisole. is an early instigator of metabolic syndrome (7Furukawa S.

Such a conclusion is congruent with the emergent view characterizing obesity as a chronic inflammatory situation (9Xu H. Barnes G.T. Yang Q. Tan G. Yang D. Chou C.J. Sole J. Nichols A. Ross J.S. Tartaglia L.A. Chen H. J. Clin. Investig. 2003; 112: 1821-1830Crossref PubMed Scopus (5062) Google Scholar). It is noteworthy that most of these studies were conducted not in situations of strict obesity but with confused metabolic pathologies defined as metabolic syndrome. Taken together, all these reports argue in favor of an oxidative redox state in morbid obesity, although the occurrence of an oxidative stress in adipose tissue during the onset of obesity has never been investigated. Other studies also evidenced the importance of redox metabolism in obesity but in an opposite way. Indeed, we recently demonstrated that in vitro preadipocyte proliferation and differentiation can be controlled by redox metabolism (10Carrière A. Fernandez Y. Rigoulet M. Pénicaud L. Casteilla L.

The aim of this work was to investigate changes in adipose tissue redox metabolism in an obese model without the confounding factors of diabetes and other metabolic dysregulations, i.e. the Zucker rat (13Tofovic S.P. Jackson E.K. Methods Mol. Med. 2003; 86: 29-46PubMed Google Scholar). The putative changes in redox defenses of the adipose tissues between obese and lean Zucker rats were compared with those occurring in blood and liver and also compared with those of rats subjected to an experimental known oxidative stress (14Ben-Shaul V. Lomnitski L. Nyska A. Zurovsky Y. Bergman M. Grossman S. Toxicol. Lett. 2001; 123: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Additionally, the importance of the redox state in the development of fat stores was assessed by studying the effect of antioxidants on lipid synthesis in cultured preadipocytes. Animals—Animals were acclimated for 7 days to 22 ± 1 °C in individual cages with a 12-h light-dark cycle and given commercial food and water ad libitum. There were 11-week-old obese and lean Zucker rats (Charles River Laboratories, L'Arbresle, France), 11-week-old Wistar rats (Janvier, Le Genest-St-Isle, France) intraperitoneally injected with 5 mg of LPS/kg (LPS dissolved in water) for 12 h, and C57 black 6N mice (Harlan, Gannat, France) for primary cultures of inguinal white adipose tissue (IW). Animals were euthanized after anesthesia with 100 mg of ketamine and 10 mg of xylazine/kg body weight. All experiments were conducted in accordance with guidelines for animal care in the Institut Federatif de Recherche Louis Bugnard, Rangueil Hospital, Toulouse. Tissues, Adipocytes, and Stroma Vascular Fraction (SVF) Isolation—Plasmas from abdominal aorta blood of anesthetized Zucker rats were collected into heparinated or EDTA tubes. Liver and epididymal and inguinal adipose tissues (EW and IW) that were considered as intra-abdominal and subcutaneous fat, respectively, were removed, washed in phosphate-buffered saline medium, blotted, weighed, and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen. Prior to biochemical measurements, frozen aliquots were pulverized. Mature adipocytes and SVF were isolated from finely minced tissues as previously described (15Prunet-Marcassus B. Moulin K. Carmona M.C. Villarroya F. Pénicaud L. Casteilla L. FEBS Lett. 1999; 464: 184-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Circulating Glucose and Insulin—Plasma glucose and insulin were measured by glucose-dye-oxidoreductase with reactive strips (Accu-Chek Active, Roche Diagnostics) and radioimmunoassay (RIA kit; Diasorin), respectively. Adipocyte Glucose Uptake—Adipocyte suspensions were incubated with or without insulin for 45 min at 37 °C in a final volume of 400 μl. Then, 2-deoxy-d-[3H]glucose (0.4 μCi) was added at a final concentration of 0.1 mm for 10 min. Assays were stopped with 100 μl of 100 μm cytochalasin B, and then aliquots were counted (16Morin N. Lizcano J.M. Fontana E. Marti L. Smih F. Rouet P. Prévot D. Zorzano A. Unzeta M. Carpéné C. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2001; 297: 563-572PubMed Google Scholar). Cell Culture and Adipogenesis Assessment—3T3-F442A preadipocytes were routinely cultivated in a 21% O2, 74% N2, and 5% CO2 humidified atmosphere. At confluence, the medium was changed and antioxidant was added. Cell cultures were maintained for 7 days after confluence (the medium and antioxidant were changed every 2 days). For primary culture of mice, IW SVF cells were purified and cultured as previously described (17Planat-Benard V. Silvestre J.S. Cousin B. André M. Nibbelink M. Tamarat R. Clergue M. Manneville C. Saillan-Barreau C. Duriez M. Tedgui A. Levy B. Pénicaud L. Casteilla L. Circulation. 2004; 109: 656-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (1184) Google Scholar). At confluence, preadipocytes were induced to differentiate in the presence of 850 nm insulin, 2 nm triiodothyronine, 33 nm dexamethasone, and 1 μg/ml of transferrin. They were treated with antioxidant as described for 3T3-F442A preadipocytes. Cellular triglyceride content was determined using a commercially available test combination (Triglyceride enzymatique PAP150; bioMérieux). Triglycerides were also stained with Oil Red O (18Ramirez-Zacarias J.L. Castro-Munozledo F. Kuri-Harcuch W. Histochemistry. 1992; 97: 493-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (801) Google Scholar) and visualized with phase contrast microscopy. Real-time PCR—Total RNA from cells was extracted by the Extract-all solution (Eurobio). Complementary DNA was synthesized with SuperScript™ reverse transcriptase and poly(dT) primers (Invitrogen). The real-time PCR measurement of individual cDNAs was performed using SYBR green dye to measure duplex DNA formation with the Gene Amp 5700 (Applied Biosystem) and normalized to the amount of 36B4 RNA. Increases of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ2 and lipoprotein lipase and decrease of β actin mRNA expression were linked with adipocyte differentiation (19Rosen E.D. Walkey C.J. Puiserver P. Spiegelman B.M. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1293-1307PubMed Google Scholar, 20Spiegelman B.M. Farmer S.R. Cell. 1982; 29: 53-60Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Primers used were the following: 36B4 sense 5′-AGTCGGAGGAATCAGATGAGGAT-3′, antisense 5′-GGCTGACTTGGTTGCTTTGG-3′; PPARγ2 sense 5′-AGTGTGAATTACAGCAAATCTCTGTTTT-3′, antisense 5′-GCACCATGCTCTGGGTCAA-3′; LPL sense 5′-GTGGCCGAGAGCGAGAAC-3′, antisense 5′-CCACCTCCGTGTAAATCAAGAAG-3′; and β actin sense 5′-CCGTGAAAAGATGACCCAGATC-3′, antisense 5′-GCCTGGATGGCTACGTACATG-3′. Antioxidant Enzymes—Powdered frozen tissues were homogenized in 3 mm EDTA, 154 mm KCl, pH 7.4 (1:10 w/v for liver, 1:2 w/v for IW or EW). The homogenates were sonicated (30 s), centrifuged at 8,000 × g for 10 min, defatted, and centrifuged at 105,000 × g for 45 min (all these steps were performed at 4 °C). Antioxidant enzyme activities were assessed in erythrocytes and in tissular cytosol or homogenate (for catalase activity). Protein assays were performed in homogenate and cytosol (21Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities (Mn-SOD, Cu-Zn SOD) were assayed by inhibition of pyrogallol autoxidation (22Marklund S. Marklund G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1974; 47: 469-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (7732) Google Scholar). Catalase activity was determined by measuring decomposition of H2O2 at 240 nm (23Clairbone A.L. Grenwald R.A. Handbook of Methods for Oxygen Radical Research. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1985: 283-284Google Scholar). Glutathione peroxidase seleno-dependent (Gpx) activity was measured using t-butylhydroperoxide as substrate (24Günzler W.A. Kremers H. Flohe L. Z. Klin. Chem. Klin. Biochem. 1974; 12: 444-448PubMed Google Scholar). α-Tocopherol, Coenzyme Q9, Glutathione, and Vitamin C—Powdered frozen tissues, adipocytes, SVF, and plasma were used to measure α-tocopherol (αToc) and total coenzyme Q9 (CoQ9) contents. After solubilization and extraction in 2-propanol, αToc and CoQ9 were detected by reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection on the same run (25Galinier A. Carrière A. Fernandez Y. Bessac A.M. Caspar-Bauguil S. Périquet B. Comtat M. Thouvenot J.P. Casteilla L. FEBS Lett. 2004; 578: 53-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Glutathione and vitamin C (VitC) were also quantified from tissue homogenates, adipocytes, and SVF. Blood glutathione was evaluated in erythrocytes and VitC in plasma. After precipitation of proteins, reduced glutathione, oxidized glutathione, total VitC, and its oxidized form (DHAA) were detected by reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection (26Melnyk S. Pogribna M. Pogribny I. Hine R.J. James S.J. J. Nutr. Biochem. 1999; 10: 490-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar) and fluorimetric detection (27Speek A.J. Schrijver J. Schreurs W.H. J. Chromatogr. 1984; 305: 53-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar), respectively. For glutathione and VitC, we calculated the redox state as [oxidized form/(oxidized + reduced)forms] × 100. MDA—Lipid peroxidation was estimated from the formation of MDA (28Yagi K. Methods Enzymol. 1984; 105: 328-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar). Statistical Analysis—Means ± S.E. were calculated, and statistically significant differences between two groups were determined by Student's t-test at p <0.05. Antioxidant Systems in Inguinal White Adipose Tissue and Liver of Lean Zucker Rats—All enzymatic activities were significantly lower in IW than in liver (Fig. 1A). Hydrophilic molecules, glutathione, and VitC (Fig. 1B) in IW exhibited lower content and higher redox state (higher ratio of the oxidized forms) than liver (p <0.05). For lipophilic molecules (Fig. 1C), CoQ9 content was lower in IW, whereas αToc content was higher than in liver. MDA content (Fig. 1C) was lower in IW than in liver (p <0.05). We then investigated the distribution of antioxidants between the mature adipocyte and stroma vascular fractions. As expected, the lipophilic molecules, CoQ9 and αToc, were mainly found in adipocytes (Fig. 2B). More surprisingly, the hydrophilic molecules, glutathione and VitC, were also mostly present in adipocytes (Fig. 2A). Metabolic Status and Adipocyte Insulin Sensitivity of Obese Zucker Rats—Because the choice of animal model was crucial to investigate the interplay between obesity and diabetes, we carefully checked the insulin resistance status of adipose tissue of 11-week-old obese Zucker rats. These rats had glycemia (9.5 ± 0.5 mm) that did not significantly differ from lean rats (8.6 ± 0.5 mm) and higher insulinemia (422.5 ± 69.0 microunits/ml versus 63.6 ± 14.4 microunits/ml for lean rats, p <0.01), confirming that these animals were obese but not diabetic. The basal glucose uptake (nmol 2-deoxy-d-[3H]glucose/100 mg of lipids/10 min) was significantly lower in obese (0.67 ± 0.19) than in lean rats (1.18 ± 0.15) (p <0.01). Furthermore, even if maximal insulin stimulation of glucose uptake was reached at 100 nm in both lean and obese isolated mature adipocytes, this uptake was lower in obese (4.04 ± 0.82) than in lean (10.16 ± 0.94) (p <0.05). However, the fold increase (over basal) was equivalent to 7.20 ± 0.97 and 10.32 ± 1.68 in obese and lean, respectively (n = 10, not significant). This demonstrates that isolated mature adipocytes from obese rats were still responsive to maximal insulin stimulation but present signals of lower insulin sensitivity. Changes in Liver and Blood Redox Metabolism of Obese Zucker Rats—Although the livers of obese Zucker rats were heavier and showed macroscopic steatosis (data not shown), no significant difference was observed for all redox parameters except a decrease of the CoQ9 content (Table 1). However, erythrocyte glutathione and plasma CoQ9 contents were significantly lower in obese than in lean rats. Moreover, erythrocyte glutathione redox state was significantly higher in obese rats.TABLE 1Enzymatic, non-enzymatic antioxidants, and lipid peroxidation in liver and blood of obese Zucker rats In blood, enzymatic activities and glutathione content were measured in erythrocytes and the other parameters were measured in plasma.

No difference was observed for Mn-SOD and Cu-Zn SOD, but catalase activity was significantly higher in obese than in lean rats (Fig. 3A). In IW, total glutathione and VitC contents were significantly higher in obese rats and their redox states were lower than in lean rats (Fig. 3B). In contrast, obese rats had lower lipophilic molecule content as well as lower MDA values than lean rats (Fig. 3C). Taken together, these results indicated that fat accumulation was associated with a greater abundance of hydrophilic antioxidants in their reduced state and lower lipid peroxidation. We then decided to use glutathione metabolism as a good index of redox changes. The study of glutathione in IW and EW of obese rats showed that glutathione content is higher in the two fat pads when the lower redox state found in obese rats is specific to IW. Contrary to what occurred in obesity, IW and EW glutathione contents were significantly decreased in situations of systemic oxidative stress and inflammation induced by LPS treatment (Fig. 3D). Reduced Redox State Parallels Triglyceride Content Increase and Adipocyte Differentiation—To evaluate the physiological consequences of the redox state evolution to a reduced set point, we treated cultured 3T3-F442A preadipocytes with an antioxidant, butylhydroxyanisole (BHA). Preadipocytes treated with increasing BHA concentrations showed a dose-dependent triglyceride increase (Fig. 4A). Similar results were obtained with another antioxidant, ascorbic acid, and confirmed with primary culture of mouse IW SVF cells (data not shown). Lipid staining by Oil Red O and adipocyte marker expression confirmed the adipocyte differentiation and lipid storage increase in BHA-treated cells (Fig. 4, B and D). As expected, glutathione content was significantly increased while its redox state was significantly decreased in cells treated with 10-4 m BHA (Fig. 4C). Increase in glutathione content, mainly in its reduced form, was concomitant with increase in triglyceride content and adipocyte differentiation. In this work we have demonstrated that, in obesity, adipose tissue is not associated with an oxidized redox state as observed in other tissues during inflammatory situations. In contrast, obesity is associated with a reduced redox state that promotes in vitro accumulation of triglycerides. Obesity is now considered a chronic inflammatory disease often associated with a decrease in antioxidant defenses and the emergence of markers of oxidative stress in blood and liver (2Touyz R.M. Schiffrin E.L. Histochem. Cell Biol. 2004; 122: 339-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar, 3Faure P. Ramon O. Favier A. Halimi S. Eur. J. Clin.

Metab. Disord. 2004; 28: 1197-1202Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). This view is not consistent with the recently observed induction of obesity in transgenic mice overexpressing one of the most important antioxidant enzymes, glutathione peroxidase (12McClung J.P. Roneker C.A. Mu W. Lisk D.J. Langlais P. Liu F. Lei X.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 8852-8857Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). Moreover, reactive oxygen species have been demonstrated to inhibit adipogenesis in vitro (11Carrière A. Carmona M.C. Fernandez Y. Rigoulet M. Wenger R.H. Pénicaud L. Casteilla L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 40462-40469Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). In addition, no change in antioxidant defenses or markers of lipid peroxidation was evidenced in the blood of young obese men when compared with their age-matched controls (30Visentin V. Prévot D. De Saint Front V.D. Morin-Cussac N. Thalamas C. Galitzky J. Valet P. Zorzano A. Carpéné C. Obes. Res. 2004; 12: 547-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). A major difficulty in studying the link between obesity and oxidative stress is that the animal models used exhibit the co-existence of congruent metabolic dysfunctions such as insulin resistance. The genetically obese Zucker rats gave us the opportunity to partly overcome this problem because it is well known that, depending on their age, they can be considered as being obese without being diabetic. Indeed, such obese animals display hyperinsulinemia but without hyperglycemia, although lower insulin sensitivity was indeed present in isolated adipocytes of obese animals. Under these conditions, enzymatic activities, hydrophilic antioxidant molecule content, and lipophilic CoQ9 content were first determined in adipose tissue of lean Zucker rats and were shown to be lower than in liver. Results for CoQ9 could be related to the low mitochondrial activity described for white adipose tissues (31Deveaud C. Beauvoit B. Hagry S. Galinier A. Carrière A. Salin B. Schaeffer J. Caspar-Bauguil S. Fernandez Y. Gordien J.B. Breilh D. Pénicaud L. Casteilla L. Rigoulet M. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2005; 70: 90-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The lower level of lipid peroxidation in adipose tissues when compared with liver could be attributed to a lower polyunsaturated fatty acid content (32Froyland L. Vaagenes H. Asiedu D.K. Garras A. Lie O. Berge R.K. Lipids. 1996; 31: 169-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) and to a higher αToc content. Despite low antioxidant defenses (except αToc), adipose tissue seemed to display little sensitivity to lipid peroxidation. Our study then showed that most of the hydrophilic and lipophilic components of the antioxidant defenses were strongly modified in the adipose tissue of obese rats and consisted of an increase in glutathione and vitamin C content in their reduced form. These changes were specific to adipose tissues because, despite steatosis, the whole liver antioxidant defenses of obese rats remained unaltered while blood markers indicated the emergence of an oxidative stress. The differences observed between obese and lean adipose tissue can be attributed essentially to mature adipocytes because of their predominant proportion in the contents of antioxidant molecules. The most surprising finding of this study was that the adipose tissue of obese rats showed fewer signs of lipid peroxidation than that of lean rats, as well as a higher content of hydrophilic molecules in a more reduced state despite a lower content of lipophilic molecules. The particularly marked reduced state of glutathione and VitC could be due to their synergic functioning. Indeed, the reduced form of VitC was regenerated by reduced glutathione, itself regenerated by glutathione reductase in the presence of NADPH, a reduced substrate generated by the potent pentose phosphate pathway in adipocytes (33Fabregat I. Revilla E. Machado A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1987; 146: 920-925Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Conversely, antioxidant defenses in the lipid phase of adipose tissue were lower in obese than in lean rats. As polyunsaturated fatty acid was markedly lower in adipose tissues of obese than of lean Zucker rats (34Douillet C. Bost M. Accominotti M. Borson-Chazot F. Ciavatti M. Biol. Trace Elem. Res. 1998; 65: 221-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), these differences could explain in part the results obtained for lipid peroxidation. The low endogenous lipid peroxidation level in obese adipose tissue was probably also related to the high content of the reduced forms of synergic glutathione and VitC, the latter being able to regenerate αToc from α-tocopheryl radical. These changes are contrary to those observed under systemic oxidative stress induced by LPS injection. Indeed, LPS-induced oxidative stress (14Ben-Shaul V. Lomnitski L. Nyska A. Zurovsky Y. Bergman M. Grossman S. Toxicol. Lett. 2001; 123: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) was, as expected, associated with an oxidized state, whereas obese Zucker rats were surprisingly in a reduced state. These results are consistent with our in vitro observation. Thus, the addition of antioxidants increased glutathione content in its reduced form and, in parallel, promoted triglyceride synthesis. Similarly, reports have shown that an increase in reactive oxygen species or a decrease in antioxidant defenses impaired preadipocyte differentiation. First, intracellular reactive oxygen species inhibited in vitro preadipocyte differentiation by specifically controlling expression of the adipogenic repressor CHOP10/GADD153 (11Carrière A. Carmona M.C. Fernandez Y. Rigoulet M. Wenger R.H. Pénicaud L. Casteilla L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 40462-40469Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Second, in vivo treatment of rats with buthionine sulfoximine, an inhibitor of glutathione synthase, decreased glutathione level and resulted in smaller adipocytes and lower body weight (35Ogihara T. Asano T. Katagiri H. Sakoda H. Anai M. Shojima N. Ono H. Fujishiro M. Kushiyama A. Kikuchi M. Noguchi N. Aburatani H. Gotoh Y. Komuro I. Fujita T. Diabetologia. 2004; 47: 794-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Finally, our conclusion is supported by studies aimed at genetic invalidation or overexpression of Gpx in mice. Genetic inactivation of Gpx1 resulted in increased oxidative stress and 20% decreased body weight (36Esposito L.A. Kokoszka E. Waymire K.G. Cottrell B. MacGregor G.R. Wallace D.C. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2000; 28: 754-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). In contrast, overexpression of Gpx1 resulted in an obese phenotype (12McClung J.P. Roneker C.A. Mu W. Lisk D.J. Langlais P. Liu F. Lei X.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 8852-8857Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). It is noteworthy that in this study the authors focused their investigations on liver and muscle and demonstrated that Gpx1 overexpression dramatically reduced intracellular reactive oxygen species. However, our conclusion seems to be contradictory to the previous one (7Furukawa S. Fujita T. Shimabukuro M. Iwaki M. Yamada Y. Nakajima Y. Nakayama O. Makishima M. Matsuda M. Shimomura I. J. Clin. Investig. 2004; 114: 1752-1761Crossref PubMed Scopus (3869) Google Scholar). This apparent discrepancy could be explained by the different obese model (KKAy mice). We carefully checked that the obese rats used in our study are lower insulin sensible but not hyperglycemic, whereas KKAy mice, whatever their age, are obese and hyperglycemic (37Fujita A. Sasaki H. Ogawa K. Okamoto K. Matsuno S. Matsumoto E. Furuta H. Nishi M. Nakao T. Tsuno T. Taniguchi H. Nanjo K. Diabetes Res. Clin. Pract. 2005; 69: 113-119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). We also demonstrated that adipose tissue of obese organisms shows an active and still adaptable redox metabolism. Thus, taking into consideration our results and other reports, we can assume that obesity per se is characterized by a reduced redox state in adipose tissues. This reduced redox state could in turn encourage cell proliferation and differentiation by modulation of redox-sensitive transcription factors (11Carrière A. Carmona M.C. Fernandez Y. Rigoulet M. Wenger R.H. Pénicaud L. Casteilla L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 40462-40469Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). A deleterious cycle thus takes place that promotes and amplifies the onset of obesity (Fig. 5). We thank J. Garcia for help in statistical data interpretation and M. C. Carmona, Y. Jeanson, D.

We therefore targeted the function of platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule, (PECAM-1), an EC surface molecule that promotes EC migration and has been implicated in in vivo angiogenesis. Administration of an anti-PECAM-1 antibody that inhibits EC migration, but not proliferation or survival in vitro, disrupted normal alveolar septation in neonatal rat pups without reducing EC content. Three-dimensional reconstruction of lungs showed that pups treated with a blocking PECAM-1 antibody had remodeling of more proximal branches resulting in large tubular airways. Subsequent studies in PECAM-1-null mice confirmed that the absence of PECAM-1 impaired murine alveolarization, without affecting EC content, proliferation, or survival. Further, cell migration was reduced in lung endothelial cells isolated from these mice. These data suggest that the loss of PECAM-1 function compromises postnatal lung development and provide evidence that inhibition of EC function, in contrast to a loss of viable EC, inhibits alveolarization.

Lung development represents a carefully coordinated process of air-way morphogenesis and concurrent vascular development (1Burri P.H. McDonald J.A. Lung Growth and Development. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1997: 1035Google Scholar). For humans and rodents, the final or alveolar stage of lung development occurs principally following birth and involves the partitioning of the large primary saccules into smaller air spaces by the inward protrusion of septae derived from the walls of the saccules (2Massaro D. Massaro G.D. Am. J. Physiol. 1986; 251: R218-R224PubMed Google Scholar, 3Massaro D. Massaro G.D. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1986; 58: 73-92Crossref Scopus (134) Google Scholar). This secondary septation greatly increases alveolar surface area, enabling efficient gas exchange. The septae begin as invaginations from the saccular wall and consist of a core of connective tissue flanked on either side by capillary vessels. In time, there is stretching and thinning of the septae, accompanied by fusion of the septal capillaries. This remodeling ultimately produces alveolar walls composed of endothelia and epithelia with interstitial tissue interposed between the two cell layers. Identifying the mechanisms that underlie the process of alveolarization may help to increase our understanding of lung diseases such as emphysema or bronchopulmonary dysplasia that are characterized by destruction or failure of development of alveoli (4Kasahara Y. Tuder R.M. Taraseviciene-Stewart L. Le Cras T.D. Abman S. Hirth P.K. Waltenberger J. Voelkel N.F. J. Clin. Investig. 2000; 106: 1311-1319Crossref PubMed Scopus (967) Google Scholar, 5Maniscalco W.M.

The promise of alveolarization as a therapeutic target is seen in the studies demonstrating that retinoic acid reverses emphysema and rescues failed septation in relevant animal models (6Massaro G.D. Massaro D. Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 675-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar, 7Massaro G.D. Massaro D. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: L955-L960Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The completion of alveolarization must necessarily involve the expansion of the vasculature (8Schachtner S.K. Wang Y. Baldwin H.S. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2000; 22: 157-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 9deMello D.E. Sawyer D. Galvin N. Reid L.M. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1997; 16: 568-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar) a process that, at this stage of lung development, involves the angiogenic sprouting of new vessels from preexisting ones. The importance of the vascular component to alveolar development is demonstrated by the fact that rat alveolarization is inhibited by treatment with anti-angiogenesis agents (e.g. fumagillin, thalidomide, or SU5416, a vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) 5The abbreviations used are: VEGF, vascular endothelial growth factor; VEGFR, VEGF receptor; EC, endothelial cell; PECAM-1, platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule; RLMEC, rat lung microvascular EC; H&E, hematoxylin and eosin; mAb, monoclonal antibody; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; TUNEL, terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP nick end-labeling; PCNA, proliferating cell nuclear antigen. receptor antagonist) (10Jakkula M Le Cras T.D.

However, all of these treatments result in endothelial cell (EC) apoptosis, making the contribution of ECs to alveolarization difficult to interpret. Nevertheless, these data suggest that molecules that regulate EC activity required for angiogenesis are likely to be important for alveolar development. One of the endothelial-expressed molecules that appears to play a role in angiogenesis, and thus might be important to the process of alveolarization, is platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule (PECAM-1) (11Newman P.J.

Several studies have demonstrated that PECAM-1 promotes EC migration (14Cao G. O'Brien C.D. Zhou Z. Sanders S.M. Greenbaum J.N. Makrigiannakis A. DeLisser H.M. Am. J.

Further, angiogenesis is reduced in PECAM-1-null mice in a model of chronic inflammation (19Solowiej A. Biswas P. Graesser D. Madri J.A. Am. J. Pathol. 2003; 162: 953-962Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Studies were therefore done in rat and mouse neonatal pups to investigate the involvement of PECAM-1 in alveolarization. Using an antibody blocking strategy, we showed that an anti-PECAM-1 antibody that inhibits EC migration, but not EC proliferation or survival in vitro, disrupts normal alveolar septation in neonatal rat pups without reducing EC content. Subsequent studies in PECAM-1-null mice confirmed these initial findings. Specifically, the absence of PECAM-1 impaired murine alveolarization, without affecting EC content, proliferation, or survival. Finally, cell migration by lung ECs isolated from PECAM-1-deficient mice was decreased in comparison with ECs from the lungs of wild type mice. These data suggest that the loss of PECAM-1 function compromises postnatal lung development and provide the first evidence that inhibition of EC function, in contrast to a loss of viable ECs, affects alveolarization Cells and Antibodies—Rat lung microvascular EC (RLMEC) was cultured in MCDB-31 medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with l-glutamine, hydrocortisone, heparin, endothelial growth factor supplement (Discovery Laboratories, Warrington, PA), and 10% serum. Lung endothelial cells were isolated immunomagnetically from wild type and PECAM-null mice using published protocols (20Bowden R.A. Ding Z.M. Donnachie E.M. Petersen T.K. Michael L.H. Ballantyne C.M. Burns A.R. Circ. Res. 2002; 90: 562-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) and were cultured in EGM-2 MV medium from Cambrex Bio Science Walkersville, Inc (Walkersville, MD). The binding of monoclonal antibody (mAb) 37 and mAb 62 to RLMEC was determined by fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis using previously described procedures (21Korhonen J. Lahtinen I. Halmekyto M. Alhonen L. Janne J. Dumont D. Alitalo K. Blood. 1995; 86: 828-835Crossref Google Scholar). In Vitro Wounding Assay—Wound-induced migration was performed as described previously (14Cao G. O'Brien C.D. Zhou Z. Sanders S.M. Greenbaum J.N. Makrigiannakis A. DeLisser H.M. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 282: C1181-C1190Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Twenty-thousand ECs were added to 24-well tissue culture plates and allowed to grow to confluence. Linear defects were then made in the monolayer. The wounded culture was washed with phosphate-buffered saline and then incubated for 24 h in medium (with 1% serum). Using computer-assisted image analysis and the Image-Pro Plus program (Media Cybernetics, Silver Spring, MD) images were obtained immediately after wounding and then 24 h later, and the distance migrated by cells at the wound edge was determined. For each condition, 3–5 wounds were analyzed. Cell Proliferation Assay—Cells were cultured for 24 h in 96-well plates, and the number of viable cells was determined using a commercially available non-radioactive colorimetric assay according to the manufacturer's instructions (CellTiter 96 AQueous non-radioactive cell proliferation assay, Promega, Madison WI). In Vitro Cell Death Detection—For the studies of apoptosis, confluent cells were exposed for 5, 24, or 48 h to serum-free medium or complete medium, with or without antibody. Apoptosis was then assessed using the APOPercentage apoptosis assay (Bicolor Ltd., Belfast. Northern Ireland) with the absorbance measured at 530 nm. Animals—The Institutional Animal Care and Utilization Committees at both The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia and The University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine approved all animal care procedures. For studies of postnatal alveolarization, rat pups derived from Sprague-Dawley rats (Charles River Breeding Laboratories, North Wilmington, MA) were untreated or injected intraperitoneally with saline, non-immune IgG, or anti-PECAM-1 antibody every other day beginning on day 1. The animals were sacrificed on day 15. Separate cohorts of rat pups were also treated with 0.1 μg of dexamethasone subcutaneously from days 1–14, a treatment known to inhibit alveolarization. PECAM-1-null mice, on a C57/Bl6 background, were the kind gift of Steven Albelda (University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA). Wild type mice, also on a C57/Bl6 background, were obtained from Taconic (Germantown, NY). Lungs were harvested on days 1, 7, and 14 and then at week 8 of life. Light and Electron Microscopy—Lungs were harvested after inflation to a pressure of 20 cm H20 using 10% formalin (paraffin sections) or 2.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 m cacodylate buffer (pH 7.4) (for electron microscopy). Paraffin blocks were sectioned for H&E staining, whereas electron microscopy sections were obtained after post-fixation in 2% osmium tetroxide and embedding in epoxy resin. Sufficient sections for representative serial sampling were produced and reviewed. Mean alveolar areas were measured by computer-assisted image analysis, and radial alveolar counts were determined by counting the number of septae that intersect a perpendicular line drawn from the center of a respiratory bronchiole of the distal acinus (connective tissue septum or pleura) (22Cooney T.P. Thurlbeck W.M. Thorax. 1982; 37: 572-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Using paraffin tissue sections, in situ cell proliferation was determined by immunohistochemical staining for PCNA, whereas apoptotic cells were identified by TUNEL assay (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN). For the PCNA staining of the endothelial cells of the noncapillary vessels, the percentage of total EC that were PCNA-positive was determined for at least 30 vessels for each mouse. For the quantitation of alveolar cell proliferation, the percentage of total alveolar cells that were PCNA-positive on a ×40 field was determined for at least 60 fields for each mouse. Real-time Reverse Transcription-PCR—For rat Tie-1 quantitative real-time reverse transcription-PCR, relative mRNA expression was assessed using polymerase-activated fluorescent PCR probes providing continuous message quantification during amplification (TaqMan, Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Differences in gene expression were determined by comparing the number of PCR cycles required to achieve a threshold of fluorescent activity above background during the exponential phase of the reaction. Normalization of sample loading was performed by the simultaneous amplification of GAPDH (with its own fluorescent probe) in each well. All reactions were carried out in at least triplicate. Specific primers/probes were synthesized by Applied Biosystem's oligo synthesis service as follows: Tie1 forward primer, 5′-GCCCTTTTAGCCTTGGTGT-3′; reverse primer, 5′-TTCACCCGATCCTGACTGGTA-3′; and probe, (5′-FAM fluorescent-reporter)-AGCTGCCTACATCGGAGACGCACC-3′. GAPDH and specific primers/probes were purchased from Applied Biosystems. For mouse Tie-1 and β-actin, reverse transcription-PCR was performed using primer pairs obtained from R&D Systems Inc and the Superscript first-strand synthesis system from Invitrogen. Computer-generated Three-dimensional Reconstructions—Sixty 5-μm-thick H&E tissue sections, taken every 5 μm, were imaged on an Axiophot Zeiss microscope at low magnification using Image software (Scion, Fredrick, MD). Serial images were then imported into SoftWoRx software (Applied Precision, Issaquah, WA) to form three-dimensional images. Polygons were then created that outlined the limits of specific structures, and then each polygon was assigned as a volume object that could be viewed and analyzed in three-dimensions. More details are provided in the supplemental data online. Statistical Analyses—Differences among groups were analyzed using one-way analysis of variance. Results are presented as means ± S.E. When statistically significant differences were found (p < 0.05), individual comparisons were made using the Bonferroni/Dunn test. Effect of Anti-PECAM-1 Antibody, mAb 62, on Rat Lung Microvascular Endothelial Cells—Initial studies were done to determine the effects of monoclonal antibodies against human PECAM-1, mAb 37 and mAb 62, on RLMEC function in vitro. These functionally distinct antibodies cross-react with rat PECAM-1 (23Nakada M.T. Amin K. Christofidou-Solomidou M. O'Brien C.D. Sun J. Gurubhagavatula I. Heavner G.A. Taylor A.H. Paddock C. Sun Q-H. Zehnder J.L. Newman P.J. Albelda S.M. DeLissser H.M. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 452-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), bind to RLMEC (Fig. 1a), and inhibit tumor-induced human angiogenesis (14Cao G. O'Brien C.D. Zhou Z. Sanders S.M. Greenbaum J.N. Makrigiannakis A. DeLisser H.M. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 282: C1181-C1190Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). However, migration of RLMEC in a wound assay was inhibited by mAb 62 in a dose-dependent manner (data shown for 100 μg/ml) but was unaffected by mAb 37 (Fig. 1b). Further, neither of these antibodies had an effect on RLMEC proliferation and/or survival (Fig. 1, c and d). mAb 62 Inhibits Postnatal Rat Alveolarization—In rodents, the first 2 weeks after birth is the critical period for alveolarization (1Burri P.H. McDonald J.A. Lung Growth and Development. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1997: 1035Google Scholar). Therefore, to investigate the potential involvement of PECAM-1 in rat alveolar development, anti-PECAM-1 antibodies were administered every other day to neonatal rat pups from birth to day 14, and lungs were examined on day 15 of life. Untreated and normal IgG-treated animals served as controls. By light microscopy of equivalently inflated lungs, control animals, as well as mAb 37-treated animals, showed thinning of the mesenchyme and increasing septal formation with time over the first 2 weeks of life (Fig. 2a; data shown for IgG). In contrast, treatment with mAb 62 resulted in distorted alveolar architecture, with alveolar sacs demonstrating poorly developed and/or incomplete alveoli. Electron microscopy of control lungs showed appropriate alveolar development and normal secondary septation (Fig. 2b). However, mAb 62-treated animals had large saccular structures with invaginations of secondary crests but few complete alveoli, suggesting that appropriate initiation of secondary crest formation had occurred but the process had failed to be completed. Consistent with these morphological observations was the finding that the mean cross-sectional alveolar area (μm2) determined from H&E sections was 50% greater in mAb 62-treated animals when compared with untreated control rats or rats treated with IgG or mAb 37 (Fig. 2c; 333 ± 30 mm2 (control) versus 486 ± 84 μm2 (mAb 62); p < 0.001, n = 4–8). Further, radial alveolar counts, another index of progressive alveolarization demonstrated significantly fewer intercepts in mAb 62-treated animals (Table 1).TABLE 1Radial alveolar counts Radial alveolar counts were determined for lungs obtained on day 15. Data represent mean ± S.E.

Lahtinen I. Halmekyto M. Alhonen L. Janne J. Dumont D. Alitalo K. Blood. 1995; 86: 828-835Crossref Google Scholar), were measured on day 15 of life using real time reverse transcription-PCR. The expression of this specific endothelial cell marker increased with age in control animals consistent with the formation of new vessels (data not shown). Significantly, in our studies, no differences were noted in any PECAM-1 antibody-treated group (Fig. 2d), indicating that EC content was not affected by these treatments. As expected, animals treated with dexamethasone, a known inhibitor of alveolarization (3Massaro D. Massaro G.D. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1986; 58: 73-92Crossref Scopus (134) Google Scholar), had significantly decreased Tie1 mRNA content on day 15. As EC content was unaffected by mAb 62 and the antibody inhibited in vitro wound-induced migration (Fig. 1b), but not EC proliferation or survival (Fig. 1, c and d), these data suggest that the disruption of alveolarization resulted from an inhibition of PECAM-1-dependent EC function (migration) and not the loss of viable ECs. Three-dimensional Reconstructions Reveal Additional Effects of mAb 62 on Airway Architecture—Upon closer examination of serial sections, it became evident that some of the enlarged air spaces were seen on multiple sections and appeared contiguous. We therefore used computer-assisted three-dimensional reconstruction of 300-μm lung blocks from untreated controls and mAb 62- and mAb 37-treated animals to further analyze airway morphology (Fig. 3). Objects identified by this process were differentiated using colors, with alveolar structures designated green, blood vessels designated red, normal airways designated gray, and abnormal contiguous air spaces designated yellow. Individual sections were confirmed to contribute to the three-dimensional picture by comparison of image stacks to the three-dimensional reconstruction (Fig. 3). Both untreated controls and mAb 37-treated animals had normal-sized alveoli and normal airway structures (Fig. 3, a and c). However, mAb 62-treated animals showed that although some alveoli of appropriate sizes were present, larger tubular structures spanned the whole length of the tissue block examined (Fig. 3b). Incomplete budding from the large tubules as well as abnormal septal formation were noted. These data indicate that even more proximal areas of saccular and alveolar development were affected by mAb 62, suggesting ongoing EC contribution to remodeling of more proximal airways during development. Movies of these reconstructions that allow for better visualization of the structures can be found in the supplemental data on-line. Impaired Alveolarization in Mice Deficient in PECAM-1—PECAM-1-null mice are viable (24Duncan G.S. Andrew D.P. Takimoto H. Kaufman S.A. Yoshida H. Spellberg J. Luis de la Pompa J. Elia A. Wakeham A. Karan-Tamir B. Muller W.A. Senaldi G. Zukowski M.M. Mak T.W. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 3022-3030PubMed Google Scholar) and demonstrate an inhibition of angiogenesis (19Solowiej A. Biswas P. Graesser D. Madri J.A. Am. J. Pathol. 2003; 162: 953-962Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Given the finding that antibody inhibition of PECAM-1 disturbs alveolarization in rats, studies were also done to determine whether secondary septation was affected in PECAM-1-deficient mice. Appropriately inflated lungs from wild type and PECAM-1-null mice were examined on day 1 or day 7 and at 8 weeks after birth (Fig. 4a). When compared with wild type mice on day 1, the lungs of knock-out mice were notable for a very disorganized architecture with larger primary alveolar sacs and thickened alveolar walls. On day 7, whereas some secondary septation was noted in mutant mice, the process appeared to be retarded in comparison with wild type mice. By 8 weeks, the differences in alveolarization between wild type and PECAM-1-null mice were smaller but still present. Using computer-assisted image analysis, the mean areas of alveolar spaces were measured to assess alveolarization. We found that immediately after birth (days 1 and 7) and at 8 weeks (adult), the mean alveolar areas were significantly greater in PECAM-1-deficient mice when compared with wild type animals (Fig. 4b). Further, at each time point, the radial counts were significantly lower in the PECAM-1-null mice (Fig. 4c). As normal alveolarization is characterized by a decrease in the cross-sectional area of the alveoli and a progressive increase in radial alveolar counts, these quantitative data provide evidence of an impairment of alveolarization in PECAM-1-null mice. Endothelial Content Is Preserved in PECAM-1-null Mice during Alveolarization—As noted above, mAb 62 inhibited rat postnatal alveolarization without altering EC content. Given this, Tie-1 expression in the lungs of wild type and PECAM-1 knock-out animals was also assessed to determine whether the loss of PECAM-1 affected EC content. Although the absence of PECAM-1 was associated with impaired alveolarization, Tie-1 mRNA levels in wild type and PECAM-1-null mice were comparable on days 1 and 14 after birth (Fig. 5a). This was confirmed at the protein level by immunoblotting (data not shown). Consistent with this was the finding that the proliferation of ECs in small and medium sized vessels (Fig. 5b), as well as that of cells (including the ECs of the microvessels) within the walls of the alveoli (Fig. 5c), were similar in wild type and PECAM-1-null animals. Further, no differences in alveolar cell apoptosis (detected by TUNEL staining) were noted between wild type and PECAM-1-deficient mice (Fig. 5d). However, wound-induced migration by ECs isolated from the lungs of neonatal PECAM-1-null mice was significantly reduced when compared with that of comparable lung endothelial cells obtained from wild type animals (5e). Cell proliferation was similar in both cell types (data not shown). These data therefore suggest that functional impairments in EC motility, rather than a loss of viable ECs, may be a mechanism for the disruption of alveolarization in PECAM-1-deficient mice. Studies were performed with rat and mouse neonatal pups to investigate the involvement of PECAM-1 in alveolarization. We found that an anti-PECAM-1 antibody that inhibits EC migration but not proliferation or survival in vitro disrupts normal alveolar septation in neonatal rat pups without reducing EC content. Further, in PECAM-1-null mice, the absence of PECAM-1 impaired murine alveolarization, without affecting EC content, proliferation, or survival. Additionally, lung ECs from these PECAM-1 mutant mice demonstrated reduced cell migration. Thus, by two complimentary approaches, we showed that the loss of PECAM-1 function disturbs postnatal lung development and implicated the importance of the pulmonary vasculature, and endothelial function in particular, to alveolar development. In the embryo, the vasculature of the lung develops initially from two separate but concurrent processes (9deMello D.E. Sawyer D. Galvin N. Reid L.M. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1997; 16: 568-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Peripherally, the capillary network arises through a process of vasculogenesis in which endothelial precursors, recruited to the pulmonary mesenchyme, differentiate and then organize into isolated sinusoidal spaces. These “blood lakes” undergo subsequent remodeling to yield the connected capillary vascular tree. Centrally, angiogenesis gives rise to the proximal precapillary vasculature through the budding and branching of new vessels from preexisting ones. Subsequent fusion and coalescence of these peripheral and central systems completes the initial establishment of the pulmonary circulation. Near term, and particularly during the period of alveolar septation, there is a significant increase in the density of intrapulmonary vasculature, the result of angiogenesis in these peripheral vessels (8Schachtner S.K. Wang Y. Baldwin H.S. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2000; 22: 157-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). The effects of inhibition of angiogenesis on rat neonatal alveolarization was studied previously by Jakkula et al. (10Jakkula M Le Cras T.D. Gebb S. Hirth K.P. Tuder R.M. Voelkel N.F. Abman S.H. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: L600-L607Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), who reported that administration of three antagonists of angiogenesis (thalidomide, fumagillin, and SU5416, a VEGFR-2 inhibitor) to neonatal animals leads to alveolar simplification and attenuated lung vascular development. These studies, although suggestive of the importance of EC to alveolarization, must be interpreted with caution. First, fumagillin and thalidomide may have effects on lung growth independent of their anti-angiogenic activities (25Griffith E.C. Niwayama S. Ramsay C.A. Chang Y.H. Liu J.O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15183-15188Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar, 26D'Amato R.J. Loughman M.S. Flynn E. Folkman Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 1998; 273: 30336-30343Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1743) Google Scholar). Thus, the inhibition of alveolarization by SU5416 might be due to the loss of viable ECs and/or impaired alveolar epithelial cell maturation and not the direct result of reduced angiogenesis. Lastly, SU5416 blocks platelet-derived growth receptor signaling in addition to that of VEGFR-2 (32Sun L. Tran N. Tang F. App H. Hirth P. McMahon G. Tang C. J. Med. Chem. 1998; 41: 2588-2603Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar). In contrast to these antagonists with potentially multiple and/or undefined effects, mAb 62, an anti-angiogenic reagent (14Cao G. O'Brien C.D. Zhou Z. Sanders S.M. Greenbaum J.N. Makrigiannakis A. DeLisser H.M. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 282: C1181-C1190Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar) that inhibits EC function (i.e. cell migration) without affecting EC survival and proliferation (Fig. 1), compromised rat alveolarization without reducing EC content (Fig. 2). PECAM-1-null mice have been developed and are viable (24Duncan G.S. Andrew D.P. Takimoto H. Kaufman S.A. Yoshida H. Spellberg J. Luis de la Pompa J. Elia A. Wakeham A. Karan-Tamir B. Muller W.A. Senaldi G. Zukowski M.M. Mak T.W. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 3022-3030PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that vascular development, in the absence of PECAM-1, is sufficient to allow for adequate embryonic development. However, subsequent studies have shown that the loss of PECAM-1 results in increased endothelial sensitivity to apoptotic stress (33Gao C. Sun W. Christofidou-Solomidou M. Sawada M. Newman D.K.

The finding that alveolarization is impaired in PECAM-1-null mice (Fig. 4) provides additional definition of the phenotype of these animals. They also raise the possibility that there may well be earlier effects in the embryo, but these are not of a sufficient magnitude to compromise the viability of the mice. Studies are therefore underway to identify more subtle embryonic defects resulting from the loss of PECAM-1. Anti-PECAM-1 antibody inhibits vessel formation in rodent models of cytokine or tumor-induced angiogenesis (17DeLisser H.M. Christofidou-Solomidou M. Strieter R.M. Burdick M.D. Robinson C.S.

Angiogenesis. 1999; 3: 181-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) as well as the vascularization by human vessels of tumors grown in human skin grafts transplanted on immunodeficient mice (14Cao G. O'Brien C.D. Zhou Z. Sanders S.M. Greenbaum J.N. Makrigiannakis A. DeLisser H.M. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 282: C1181-C1190Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). The conclusions from these antibody-blocking studies have been confirmed by the finding that angiogenesis is reduced in PECAM-1-null mice in a model of chronic inflammation (19Solowiej A. Biswas P. Graesser D. Madri J.A. Am. J. Pathol. 2003; 162: 953-962Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) as well as in models of tumor growth and vascularization of subcutaneous Matrigel implants. 6H. M. DeLisser, unpublished data. In vitro, expression of PECAM-1 promotes EC motility (14Cao G. O'Brien C.D. Zhou Z. Sanders S.M. Greenbaum J.N. Makrigiannakis A. DeLisser H.M. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 282: C1181-C1190Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 15Gratzinger D. Canosa S. Engelhardt B. Madri J.A. FASEB J. 2003; 17: 1458-1469Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), and we observed that the loss of PECAM-1 from murine EC impairs cell migration (Fig. 5e). Thus, our finding that EC content is preserved in both of the model systems used (Figs. 2d and 5a) is consistent with the putative role of PECAM-1 as a facilitator of EC migration. Consequently, given the importance of vessel formation and remodeling to alveolarization (8Schachtner S.K. Wang Y. Baldwin H.S. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2000; 22: 157-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 9deMello D.E. Sawyer D. Galvin N. Reid L.M. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1997; 16: 568-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar), the disturbances in alveolar formation resulting from the loss of PECAM-1 function may be directly related to insufficient and/or inefficient angiogenesis due to compromises in PECAM-1-dependent EC function. In addition to disturbances in angiogenesis, at least three other processes should be considered. First, PECAM-1 is an intercellular/junctional molecule that may play a role in regulating vascular permeability (39Graesser D. Solowiej A. Bruckner M. Osterweil E. Juedes A. Davis S. Ruddle N.H. Engelhardt B. Madri J.A. J. Clin. Investig. 2002; 109: 383-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Thus, the loss of PECAM-1 function might enhance the extravasation of serum proteins and the elaboration of an abnormal matrix that might have inhibitory effects on epithelial and/or endothelial cell activity. Second, Gao et al. (33Gao C. Sun W. Christofidou-Solomidou M. Sawada M. Newman D.K. Bergom C. Albelda S.M. Matsuyama S. Newman P.J. Blood. 2003; 102: 169-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) observed increased endothelial apoptosis at baseline in the large pulmonary vessels of PECAM-1-deficient mice. In contrast to their report, however, we detected a low level of alveolar cell apoptosis and no differences between wild type and PECAM-1-null animals (Fig. 5d). We cannot completely exclude the possibility that enhanced EC apoptosis, induced by the loss of PECAM-1 function, might contribute to a disruption of alveolarization. However, if this were a factor, its effect, based on our data, appears to be modest at best. Last, there is evidence that pancreatic differentiation and liver organogenesis are regulated in part by signals from the endothelium of the vasculature (40Matsumoto K. Yoshitomi H. Rossant J. Zaret K.S. Science. 2001; 294: 559-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (702) Google Scholar, 41Lammert E. Cleaver O. Melton D. Science. 2001; 294: 564-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (873) Google Scholar). Thus, engagement of lung endothelial PECAM-1 during alveolarization might initiate signals that regulate lung epithelial differentiation and airway morphogenesis. This possibility is suggested by our finding in rat pups that anti-PECAM-1 antibody treatment had effects on the architecture of the larger, more proximal conducting airways (Fig. 3). Alveolar abnormalities with vascular pathologies are the hallmark of emphysema in adults (42Hogg J.C. Lancet. 2004; 364: 709-721Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (920) Google Scholar) and bronchopulmonary dysplasia in preterm infants (43Coalson J. Bland R. Coalson J.J. Chronic Lung Disease in Early Infancy. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York2000: 85-124Google Scholar). That the targeting of the vasculature may well be part of the pathogenesis of these diseases is suggested by animal studies. In rats, emphysema occurs with induction of alveolar cell apoptosis, after treatment with a VEGF receptor antagonist (4Kasahara Y. Tuder R.M. Taraseviciene-Stewart L. Le Cras T.D. Abman S. Hirth P.K. Waltenberger J. Voelkel N.F. J. Clin. Investig. 2000; 106: 1311-1319Crossref PubMed Scopus (967) Google Scholar), and decreased expression of VEGF and its Flt-1 receptor are associated with abnormal development of alveolar capillaries in a baboon model of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (5Maniscalco W.M. Watkins R.H. Pryhuber G.S. Bhatt A. Shea C. Huyck H. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 282: L811-L823Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Thus, endothelial cell death and/or the loss of functionally intact EC (as suggested by this report) may interfere with the host response to environmental insults or lung injury and in turn contribute to the development of certain forms of parenchymal lung disease.

https://openalex.org/W2164522756,"Macrophage apoptosis and the ability of phagocytes to clear these apoptotic cells are important processes in advanced atherosclerosis. Phagocytic clearance not only disposes of dead cells but usually elicits an anti-inflammatory response. To study this process in a model of advanced lesional macrophage death, macrophages rendered apoptotic by free cholesterol loading (FC-AMs) were incubated briefly with fresh macrophages (“phagocytes”). FC-AMs were promptly ingested by the phagocytes, which was dependent upon actin polymerization and the phagocyte Mer receptor. Surprisingly, this brief exposure to FC-AMs triggered a modest proinflammatory response in the phagocytes: tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and interleukin (IL)-1β were induced, whereas the levels of transforming growth factor-β and IL-10 were not increased. This response required cell contact between the FC-AMs and phagocytes but not FC-AM ingestion. TNF-α and IL-1β induction required one or more proteins on the FC-AM surface and was dependent on signaling through extracellular signal-regulated kinase-1/2 mitogen-activated protein kinase and nuclear factor-κB in the phagocytes. TNF-α production was markedly greater when Mer-defective phagocytes were used, indicating that Mer attenuated the inflammatory response. Interestingly, a more typical anti-inflammatory response was elicited when phagocytes were exposed to macrophages rendered apoptotic by oxidized low density lipoprotein or UV radiation. Thus, the proinflammatory milieu of advanced atherosclerotic lesions may be promoted, or at least not dampened, by contact between FC-induced apoptotic macrophages and neighboring phagocytes prior to apoptotic cell ingestion.

However, the significance of macrophage apoptosis in atherosclerosis development remains unclear. During the initial or intermediate stages of atherosclerosis, accelerated apoptosis and rapid removal of the apoptotic cells by neighboring macrophage phagocytes appear to reduce the number of atherogenic and inflammation-prone macrophages within the plaque and therefore decelerate lesion progression (12Arai S. Shelton J.M. Chen M. Bradley M.N. Castrillo A. Bookout A.L. Mak P.A. Edwards P.A. Mangelsdorf D.J. Tontonoz P. Miyazaki T.

On the other hand, macrophage apoptosis in advanced lesions has been implicated in the generation of necrotic cores, a “graveyard of dead macrophages” that is thought to promote plaque instability (6Tabas I. Cell Death Differ. 2004; 11: S12-S16Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 15Schaefer H.E. Hamatol. Bluttransfus. 1981; 27: 137-142Google Scholar, 16Ball R.Y. Stowers E.C. Burton J.H. Cary N.R.

Lee R.T. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1996; 7: 330-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). The difference may lie not only in accelerated apoptosis in late lesions, but perhaps even more so in defective phagocytic clearance of apoptotic cells (14Tabas I. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2005; 25: 2255-2264Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar, 18Henson P.M. Bratton D.L. Fadok V.A. Curr.

A. 1999; 96: 6353-6358Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). When apoptotic cells are not rapidly cleared, they undergo postapoptotic necrosis, which could contribute to lesional necrosis. Although defective clearance of apoptotic macrophages by a subpopulation of incompetent phagocytes in advanced atheromata likely contributes to necrotic core formation, it is almost certain that other phagocytes in advanced lesions are competent and can ingest apoptotic macrophages. According to the literature, this event should at least partially counterbalance the effect of the incompetent phagocytes for two reasons: postapoptotic necrosis is prevented, and the competent phagocytes should elicit an anti-inflammatory response upon exposure to apoptotic cells (18Henson P.M. Bratton D.L. Fadok V.A. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: R795-R805Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar, 19Savill J. Fadok V. Nature. 2000; 407: 784-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (1281) Google Scholar). The latter point is based upon a number of studies showing that apoptotic cells induce in phagocytes the secretion of TGF-β and IL-10, which have anti-inflammatory roles in atherosclerosis (22Kulkarni A.B.

Immunol. 1999; 163: 6164-6172Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To model the latter scenario, we set up an experimental system in which FC-induced apoptotic macrophages were exposed briefly to competent phagocytes to enable ingestion, and then the noningested apoptotic cells were removed. We found that this brief exposure to FC-induced apoptotic cells did not lead to the typical anti-inflammatory response in the phagocytes but rather induced the production of the proinflammatory cytokines TNF-α and IL-1β. Thus, even in the case where FC-induced apoptotic macrophages are ingested rapidly by competent phagocytes, as likely occurs to some degree in advanced atherosclerotic lesions, inflammation is not suppressed.

Mice were immunized intradermally with 100 μl emulsion. 14 days later, the immunization protocol was repeated except incomplete Freund's adjuvant was used instead of complete Freund's adjuvant. 7 days later, the mice were injected intraperitoneal with 0.5 ml of phosphate-buffered saline containing 100 μg mBSA. 4 days later, macrophages were harvested by peritoneal lavage. Concanavalin A-elicited macrophages were obtained from mice that were injected intraperitoneal with 0.5 ml of phosphate-buffered saline containing 40 μg of concanavalin A. Macrophages were harvested 3 days later by peritoneal lavage. Thioglycollate-elicited or resident macrophages were used as phagocytes in some experiments. Thioglycollate-elicited macrophages were obtained from mice that were injected intraperitoneally with 1 ml of 3.8% thioglycollate broth. Macrophages were harvested 4 days later by peritoneal lavage (38Liang C.P. Han S. Okamoto H. Carnemolla R. Tabas I. Accili D. Tall A.R. J. Clin. Invest. 2004; 113: 764-773Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Resident macrophages were harvested by peritoneal lavage without any previous stimulation. The cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin, and 20% l-cell-conditioned medium for 24-48 h until confluence. Generation of Apoptotic Cells—FC-induced apoptotic macrophages (FC-AMs) were generated by incubating the cells with 50 μg/ml acetyl-LDL and 10 μg/ml of the ACAT inhibitor 58035 for 16-20 h. Oxidized LDL-induced apoptotic macrophages were generated by incubating the cells with 100 μg/ml oxidized LDL for 24-30 h. UV-induced apoptotic macrophages were generated by radiating the cells for 10-15 min (254 nm, 20 J/cm2), followed by culturing the cells for an additional 2-3 h. Apoptosis was confirmed by annexin V staining. In a typical experiment, a population of macrophages with 30-40% apoptosis (annexin V-positive) and less than 5% necrosis (PI-positive) were collected and exposed to phagocytes for 30 min. There was no significant increase in necrosis (i.e. PI-positivity) during this 30-min period. To generate FC-AM-conditioned medium, the FC-loading medium was removed, and the FC-AMs were gently washed twice and then incubated in fresh medium for 1 h. The medium was then centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 5 min before use. To generate membranes, FC-AMs or control macrophages were subjected to three cycles of rapid freezing and thawing. Limited proteolysis was done by treating FC-AMs with 0.1-1.0 mg/ml trypsin in DMEM at 37 °C for 20 min and then washing the cells with DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum six times. Phagocytosis—Apoptotic cells were added to a monolayer of fresh macrophages (“phagocytes”) at a ratio of 5:1 (apoptotic cells:phagocytes). In a typical phagocytosis experiment, the apoptotic cells were labeled with Alexa Fluor 488- or 594-conjugated annexin V (Molecular Probes). After incubation for 15-30 min with the phagocytes, non-ingested apoptotic cells were removed by vigorous washing. The phagocytes were then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and viewed by confocal fluorescence microscopy. Additional experiments to confirm internalization of the apoptotic cells are presented under “Results.” To examine the cellular responses in the phagocytes following contact with apoptotic cells, noningested apoptotic cells were removed by vigorous washing after a 30-min incubation as above, and the phagocytes were incubated in fresh media for the indicated times. Cytokine Production—Phagocytes were incubated with apoptotic cells for 30 min. Noningested apoptotic cells were removed, and phagocytes were cultured in fresh media for various times. At the end of incubation, the media were centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 5 min, and the supernatant fractions were stored in aliquots at -80 °C. Cytokine levels in the media were determined by high sensitivity ELISA analysis, which was conducted by the Cytokine Core Laboratory (Baltimore, MD). RT-QPCR—Total RNA was extracted from macrophages using the RNeasy kit from Qiagen. cDNA was synthesized from 4 μg of total RNA using oligo(dT) and Superscript II (Invitrogen). 0.5 μl of cDNA was subjected to QPCR amplification using Taqman universal PCR master mix (Applied Biosystems). The forward and reverse primers for TGF-β were TGACGTCACTGGAGTTGTACGG and GGTTCATGTCATGGATGGTGC, respectively, and the probe was 6FAM-TTCAGCGCTCACTGCTCTTGTGACAG. The forward and reverse primers for TNF-α were CGGAGTCCGGGCAGGT and GCTGGGTAGAGAATGGATGAACA, respectively, and the probe was 6FAM-CTTTGGAGTCATTGCTCTGTGAAGGGAATG. The forward and reverse primers for IL-1β were CAACCAACAAGTGATATTCTCCATG and GATCCACACTCTCCAGCTGCA, respectively, and the probe was 6FAM-CTGTGTAATGAAAGACGGCACACCCACC. 36B4 was used as the internal control. The forward and reverse primers for 36B4 were AGATGCAGCAGATCCGCAT and GTTCTTGCCCATCAGCACC, respectively, and the probe was CAL-CGCTCCGAGGGAAGGCCG. The reactions were run on an MX4000 multiplex quantitative PCR system (Stratagene). The thermal profile settings were 50 °C for 2 min, 95 °C for 10 min, followed by 45 cycles at 95 °C for 15 s and then 60 °C for 1 min. Immunoblotting—Whole cell lysates were prepared by homogenizing the cells into 1× sample loading buffer from Bio-Rad. Nuclear extracts were prepared using the Nuclear Extraction kit from Panomics, Inc. Cell extracts were electrophoresed on 4-20% gradient SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to 0.22-μm nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were blocked in Tris-buffered saline, 0.1% Tween 20 (TBST) containing 5% (w/v) nonfat milk at room temperature for 1 h. The membranes were then incubated with the primary antibody in TBST containing 5% (w/v) nonfat milk or 5% BSA at 4 °C overnight, followed by incubation with the appropriate secondary antibody coupled to horseradish peroxidase. Proteins were detected by ECL chemiluminescence (Pierce). Statistics—Data are presented as the mean ± S.E. To quantify the percentage of phagocytes positive for uptake, n = 10 fields of cells at a magnification of ×20 were studied. For RT-PCR and ELISA data, n = 3 separate samples for each condition were examined. Statistical significance was determined using Student's t test with unequal variance. FC-induced Apoptotic Macrophages Are Removed Promptly by Phagocytes—To examine how phagocytes ingest and respond to FC-induced apoptotic macrophages, we added these cells to a monolayer of fresh macrophages for 15-60 min, followed by removal of noningested cells by vigorous rinsing. To avoid confusion, we refer to the FC-induced apoptotic macrophages as FC-AMs and the phagocytic macrophages as phagocytes. To begin, we examined whether FC-AMs were substrates for phagocytic ingestion by adding Alexa Fluor 594-conjugated annexin V-labeled FC-AMs (red) to a monolayer of CellTracker Green-labeled phagocytes (green). Using confocal microscopy, we found that ingestion of FC-AMs by the phagocytes, indicated by red inclusions in green cells, occurred as early as 15 min after incubation (Fig. 1A, left panel). The typical percentage of phagocytes positive for ingesting FC-AMs cells was 20-30%, compared with 40-50% for UV-irradiated Jurkat cells, which are often used in phagocytosis studies of this nature. Careful examination of the confocal micrographs showed that the rinsing protocol removed bound but noningested FC-AMs, and so only ingestion is being assayed in this protocol. Preincubation of the phagocytes with cytochalasin D or latrunculin A, compounds that block phagocytosis by disrupting actin polymerization, completely inhibited apoptotic cell uptake (Fig. 1A, middle and right panels). Ingestion of FC-AMs, rather than simple binding of the cells to the phagocytes, was also demonstrated by a sequential labeling protocol: FC-AMs labeled with Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated annexin V (green) were added to phagocytes as above. After noningested cells were removed, phagocytes were incubated in fresh media for 30 min and then stained with Alexa Fluor 594-conjugated annexin V (red). The second stain would label any FC-AMs that were not ingested, as demonstrated by a control experiment in which FC-AMs that were not exposed to phagocytes were labeled with both green and red annexin V using this sequential procedure (data not displayed). As shown in Fig. 1B, very little red staining was observed, indicating that almost all of the FC-AMs were completely internalized by the phagocytes. The FC-loaded macrophages added to the phagocytes contained a proportion of viable macrophages as well as FC-AMs (i.e. not all of the macrophages are rendered apoptotic by FC loading (8Yao P.M. Tabas I. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23807-23813Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar)). To confirm that the viable cells were removed efficiently from the phagocyte monolayer using our rinsing protocol, we labeled populations of FC-loaded and non-FC-loaded macrophages (i.e. 100% viable) with CellTracker Green. These cells were then added to unlabeled phagocytes and subjected to the incubation and rinsing protocol described above. In the FC-loaded population, there was abundant association of green-labeled cells with phagocytes (Fig. 1C, left pair of images). In contrast, the unloaded (“control”) population of macrophages did not label the phagocytes (Fig. 1C, right pair of images). Thus, viable macrophages are removed efficiently by the rinsing protocol used in our phagocytosis assay. The data also show that labeling FC-loaded macrophages with CellTracker Green yields phagocytosis results similar to those observed when the FC-AMs are labeled with fluorescent annexin V. As mentioned above, the experimental system used herein was designed as a model of those phagocytes in advanced lesions which remain competent to clear apoptotic macrophages. However, there is evidence that some of the phagocytes in advanced atherosclerotic lesions are relatively inefficient at clearing apoptotic macrophages (14Tabas I. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2005; 25: 2255-2264Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar, 20Schrijvers D.M. De Meyer G.R. Kockx M.M. Herman A.G. Martinet W. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2005; 25: 1256-1261Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). In this context, we asked whether two types of alterations of macrophages that occur in advanced lesions, namely, cholesteryl ester loading (“foam cells”) and predeath FC loading, would alter the ability of phagocytes to ingest FC-AMs. To test this point, phagocytes were first incubated for 12 h in the absence or presence of acetyl-LDL or acetyl-LDL plus the ACAT inhibitor 58035 to generate control phagocytes, foam cell phagocytes, or preapoptotic FC-loaded phagocytes, respectively. The phagocytes were then exposed to FC-AMs as above and assayed for apoptotic cell ingestion. Interestingly, these lipid-laden phagocytes were able to ingest FC-AMs as efficiently as control phagocytes that did not contain excess cholesterol (Fig. 1D). Thus, to the extent that certain phagocytes in advanced lesions are unable to clear apoptotic cells, cholesteryl ester accumulation or predeath FC loading does not appear to be the cause of the phagocytic defect. Mer Plays a Critical Role in the Uptake of FC-AMs—A number of phagocyte receptors have been implicated in apoptotic cell recognition and uptake, including the membrane tyrosine kinase Mer, CD36, αvβ3 integrin, LRP, and perhaps a heretofore unidentified receptor that recognizes phosphatidylserine (PS) (39Lauber K. Blumenthal S.G. Waibel M. Wesselborg S. Mol. Cell. 2004; 14: 277-287Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar, 40Moreira M.E. Barcinski M.A. An. Acad. Bras. Cienc. 2004; 76: 93-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Apoptotic cell removal in vivo is defective in Mer-deficient (mertk) mice (41Scott R.S. McMahon E.J. Pop S.M. Reap E.A. Caricchio R. Cohen P.L. Earp H.S. Matsushima G.K. Nature. 2001; 411: 207-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (940) Google Scholar) but appears to be normal in other receptor knock-out mouse models. We explored the potential role of these receptors in phagocytosis of FC-AMs by using the following manipulations: (a) preincubation of phagocytes with PS-liposomes or with the integrin-specific blocking peptide RGDS (Fig. 2A); or (b) using phagocytes from Cd36-/-mice, macrophage-specific LRP-deficient mice, or mertk mice, which have a mutation in Mer that renders the receptor dysfunctional (34Camenisch T.D. Koller B.H. Earp H.S. Matsushima G.K. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 3498-3503Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 2, B-D). The data show that interrupting interactions through PS, RGDS-integrins, LRP, and CD36 had minimal effects on uptake of FC-AMs, even though we were able to reproduce the inhibitory effect of the above manipulations using phagocytosis systems reported previously (42, 43 and data not displayed). On the other hand, when the phagocytes were from mertk mice, uptake of FC-AMs was suppressed by ∼60% (Fig. 2D). Thus, Mer plays an important role in the uptake of FC-AMs by phagocytes. Phagocytes Exposed to FC-AMs Produce a Number of Proinflammatory Cytokines and Fail to Induce TGF-β and IL-10—Phagocytosis of apoptotic T cells and neutrophils by macrophages induces the production of the anti-inflammatory cytokine TGF-β, which activates signaling pathways leading to transcriptional suppression of proinflammatory cytokines (28Fadok V.A. Bratton D.L. Konowal A. Freed P.W. Westcott J.Y. Henson P.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 890-898Crossref PubMed Scopus (2577) Google Scholar, 29McDonald P.P. Fadok V.A. Bratton D. Henson P.M. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 6164-6172Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We examined whether FC-AMs would also elicit anti-inflammatory responses in phagocytes. Surprisingly, we found modest increases in the mRNA and protein levels of the proinflammatory cytokines TNF-α and IL-1β, whereas TGF-β mRNA and protein were not increased (Fig. 3, black bar in each graph). IL-10 mRNA was also unchanged, and IL-10 protein was below the det"

Although CYP2E1 is predominantly found in the endoplasmic reticulum, it is also located in rat hepatic mitochondria. In the current study, chronic alcohol consumption induced rat hepatic mitochondrial CYP2E1. To study the role of mitochondrial targeted CYP2E1 in generating oxidative stress and causing damage to mitochondria, HepG2 lines overexpressing CYP2E1 in mitochondria (mE10 and mE27 cells) were established by transfecting a plasmid containing human CYP2E1 cDNA lacking the hydrophobic endoplasmic reticulum targeting signal sequence into HepG2 cells followed by G418 selection. A 40-kDa catalytically active NH2-terminally truncated form of CYP2E1 (mtCYP2E1) was detected in the mitochondrial compartment in these cells by Western blot analysis. Cell death caused by depletion of GSH by buthionine sulfoximine (BSO) was increased in mE10 and mE27 cells as compared with cells transfected with empty vector (pCI-neo). Antioxidants were able to abolish the loss of cell viability. Increased levels of reactive oxygen species and mitochondrial 3-nitrotyrosine and 4-hydroxynonenal protein adducts and decreased mitochondrial aconitase activity and mitochondrial membrane potential were observed in mE10 and mE27 cells treated with BSO. The mitochondrial membrane stabilizer, cyclosporine A, was also able to protect these cells from BSO toxicity. These results revealed that CYP2E1 in the mitochondrial compartment could induce oxidative stress in the mitochondria, damage mitochondria membrane potential, and cause a loss of cell viability.

Induction of CYP2E1 by ethanol appears to be one of the central pathways by which ethanol is believed to generate a state of oxidative stress. CYP2E1 is active in oxidizing ethanol to acetaldehyde and in oxidizing many agents to reactive metabolites that are hepatotoxic (1Lieber C.S. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 517-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (787) Google Scholar). CYP2E1 is also reactive in the production of O.2- and H2O2 during microsomal mixed function oxidase activity (2Gorsky L.D.

The addition of ethanol, iron, or arachidonic acid to HepG2 cell lines that overexpress human CYP2E1 (E9 cells, E47 cells) decreased cell viability and caused apoptosis (11Chen Q. Galleano M.

A recent study indicated that CYP2E1 is also present in mitochondria of rat liver and that it can be induced by pyrazole feeding (19Robin M.A. Anandatheerthavarada H.K. Fang J.K. Cudic M. Otvos L. Avadhani N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24680-24689Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Molecular basis studies demonstrated that an NH2-terminally truncated form of CYP2E1 was specifically targeted to the mitochondria (20Neve E.P. Ingelman-Sundberg M. FEBS Lett. 1999; 460: 309-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). It was demonstrated that this mitochondrially localized form of CYP2E1 was an NH2-terminally truncated form of CYP2E1 of ∼40 kDa, which was shown to be soluble, catalytically active, and localized in the mitochondrial matrix (21Neve E.P. Ingelman-Sundberg M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11317-11322Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). In addition, this truncated short form of CYP2E1 was present in low levels in vivo in mitochondria isolated from rat liver (20Neve E.P. Ingelman-Sundberg M. FEBS Lett. 1999; 460: 309-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). In the present study, we found that chronic alcohol consumption could induce rat hepatic mitochondrial CYP2E1. To study the role of mitochondrial targeted CYP2E1 in generating oxidative stress and damage to mitochondria, HepG2 cell lines overexpressing CYP2E1 in mitochondria were established, and the role of mitochondrial targeted CYP2E1 in oxidative stress and damage to mitochondria and cellular toxicity was evaluated. Reagents—Rhodamine 123 and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG were purchased from Molecular Probes, Inc. (Eugene, OR). Polyclonal antibody raised in rabbit against human CYP2E1 was obtained from Dr. Jerome M. Lasker (Institute for Biomedical Research, Hackensack, NJ) as a kind gift. Rabbit anti-human Mn-SOD antibody was obtained from Calbiochem. BSO, GSH, Trolox, 2′-7′-dichlorofluorescein diacetate, horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG, fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG, minimal essential medium, and fetal bovine serum were purchased from Sigma. Treatment of Animals and Isolation of Subcellular Fractions—Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats (150-170 g) were housed in a facility approved by The American Association for Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care and were fed with commercially available ethanol (35%) and control diets (Bio-Serv, Frenchtown, NJ) that were equicaloric and had the same composition with respect to fat (42% of calories) and protein (16% of calories) for 2 months. Livers were perfused with ice-cold saline. Mitochondria were isolated as described (22Bai J. Rodriguez A.M. Melendez J.A. Cederbaum A.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26217-26224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). Briefly, 1 gram of liver tissue was suspended in 1 ml of cold isolation buffer (0.32 m sucrose, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4) and homogenized using a glass homogenizer. The homogenate was centrifuged at 1330 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. The supernatants were centrifuged at 21,200 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The pellet was suspended in a 15% Percoll solution, and aliquots were layered onto discontinuous Percoll gradients (23% over 40%) and then centrifuged for 15 min at 30,700 × g at 4 °C. The dense band of material at the interface between the 23 and 40% Percoll layers was collected, diluted 1:4 in fresh isolation buffer, and then centrifuged for 10 min at 16,700 × g at 4 °C. The pellet was resuspended in 2 ml of isolation buffer and centrifuged again for 10 min at 6900 × g. For rat liver mitochondrial CYP2E1 Western blot analysis, the mitochondria were further purified following the method as described (19Robin M.A. Anandatheerthavarada H.K. Fang J.K. Cudic M. Otvos L. Avadhani N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24680-24689Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Briefly, the resultant mitochondria were washed twice with the isolation buffer, resuspended at a concentration of 10 mg/ml, and incubated at 4 °C for 2 min with digitonin (Sigma) at a final concentration of 75 μg/mg of protein. Mitoplasts were then washed three times with the homogenization buffer and resuspended in 50 mm potassium phosphate containing 0.1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. For mitochondria isolated from cells in culture, the mitochondrial pellet was suspended in 100 μl of PBS after the Percoll purification and used for Western blot analysis or aconitase activity assay. Microsomes were isolated from the post-mitochondrial supernatant by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4°C. The pellet was resuspended with PBS and used for Western blot analysis. Plasmid Construction—The cDNA of CYP2E1 lacking the coding sequence for NH2 terminus amino acids 2-34 was generated by PCR using primers (forward, 5′-GGACGAATTCCGGCACCATGGGTCCTTTCCCGCTTCCCATC-3′; reverse, 5′-ATTAACCCTCACTACTAAAGGGA-3′) and plasmid containing full-length human CYP2E1 cDNA (pCI-CYP2E1) as template. The resulting cDNA was digested with EcoRI and ligated in the EcoRI site of the restricted pCI-neo plasmid. The correct DNA sequence of the insert was confirmed by DNA sequencing. Cell Culture and Transfection—HepG2 cells were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) and were cultured in minimal essential medium containing 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 2 mm glutamine in a humidified atmosphere in 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Before transfection, HepG2 cells were seeded onto dishes and grown to 90% confluence. The expression plasmid vectors pCI-neo and pCI-neo containing the human CYP2E1 cDNA lacking the coding sequence for amino acids 2-34 (pCI-mtCYP2E1) were transfected into HepG2 cells using the Lipo-fectamine™ 2000 transfection reagent (Invitrogen). Forty-eight hours after transfection, cells were trypsinized and seeded at low cell density onto 10-cm culture dishes in 10% fetal bovine serum plus minimum essential medium containing 100 μg/ml G418. Two weeks after transfection, the surviving clones were isolated, transferred to 6-well plates, and grown to large scale. Mitochondrial CYP2E1 expression in each clone was measured by Western blot. Stable cell lines with overexpression of mitochondrial CYP2E1, as well as cells transfected with the empty vector, were selected and maintained in minimum essential medium containing 100 μg/ml G418. Western Blot—After protein determination, 20-30 μg of either purified mitochondria or cell extract was resolved on 8-12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and electroblotted onto nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad). Membranes with transferred proteins were incubated with rabbit anti-human CYP2E1 antibody (1:10,000) as primary antibody followed by incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated to goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:10,000) as the secondary antibody. Chemiluminescence reaction using the ECL kit (Amersham Biosciences; Little Chalfont, Buckinghamshire, UK) was carried out for 1 min followed by exposure to Kodak X-Omat radiograph film (Eastman Kodak Co.). Similar procedures were carried out to detect Mn-SOD, β-actin, and 3-NT and 4-HNE protein adducts using anti-Mn-SOD (1:1000), anti-β-actin (1:10,000), anti-3-NT (1:2000), and anti-4-HNE (1:1000) antibodies. Catalytic Activity—The catalytic activity of mtCYP2E1 was determined by monitoring the formation of 6-hydroxy-chlorzoxazone essentially as described (21Neve E.P. Ingelman-Sundberg M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11317-11322Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Mitochondria from pCI-neo, mE10, and mE27 cells were isolated and disrupted by sonication on ice. The incubation mixture consisted of 250 μg of sonically disrupted mitochondria, 250 μm chlorzoxazone, an NADPH generating system (0.2 mm NADPH, 2.0 mm glucose 6-phosphate, and 3 units/ml glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase), 1 nmol of adrenodoxin (Adx), and 0.1 nmol of adrenodoxin reductase (AdR) (kindly supplied by Prof. Rita Bernhardt, University of Saarbrücken, Germany), and 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, in a final volume of 0.25 ml. After 30 min, the reaction was terminated by the addition of orthophosphoric acid. After extraction, the samples were analyzed by HPLC equipped with an amperometric detector. Immunofluorescence Microscopy—pCI-neo, mE10, and mE27 cells as well as E47 cells (an HepG2 cell line overexpressing wild type CYP2E1 in the ER) were grown in minimal essential medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum on glass coverslips and were fixed at room temperature for 10 min with freshly prepared 2.5% paraformaldehyde in PBS. Cells were washed three times for 10 min in 0.3 m glycine prepared in PBS and permeabilized for 5 min in 0.5% Triton X-100 at room temperature followed by three washes in PBS. Cells were incubated for 1 h with a 1:500 dilution of a rabbit anti-human CYP2E1 polyclonal antibody and a 1:100 dilution of sheep anti-human Mn-SOD polyclonal antibody followed by three washes in PBS and incubated with a 1:160 dilution of a goat anti-rabbit antibody labeled with fluorescein isothiocyanate and a 1:100 dilution of a donkey anti-sheep antibody conjugated with Alexa Fluor 594. After three washes in PBS, cells were incubated with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 5 min followed by an additional three washes in PBS. The coverslips were mounted on slides and examined by confocal microscopy. GSH Measurement—The intracellular and mitochondrial GSH levels were evaluated as described in Ref. 23Hissin P.J. Hilf R. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 74: 214-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (3723) Google Scholar with the fluorometric substrate o-phthalaldehyde (MP Biomedicals, LLC, Aurora, OH). Briefly, pCI-neo and mE27 cells were treated with or without 0.2 mm BSO. After 24 h of treatment, the total cellular extracts and mitochondrial compartments were prepared, and the protein concentrations were measured; 200 μ1 of sample containing 1 mg of protein was mixed with an equal volume of 10% (w/v) of trichloroacetic acid and were left at room temperature for 10 min followed by centrifugation at 10,000 rpm for 10 min. The supernatants were used for assaying GSH. The final assay mixture contained 0.1 ml of supernatant, 1.8 ml of phosphate-EDTA buffer, and 0.1 ml of the o-phthalaldehyde solution containing 0.1 mg of o-phthalaldehyde. The same volume of different concentrations of GSH solutions was used for preparing a standard curve. After thorough mixing and incubation at room temperature for 15 min, the solution was transferred to a cuvette. Fluorescence at 420 nm was determined with the activation at 350 nm. The GSH level was obtained by comparing with the GSH standards and represented as nmol/mg of protein. DCF Fluorescence as a Measure of Reactive Oxygen Production—After treatment of the cells with or without 0.2 mm BSO, an inhibitor of glutamate cysteine ligase that lowers cellular GSH levels, DCF-DA was added at a final concentration of 2 μg/ml, and plates were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C in the dark. Cells were washed twice with 1× PBS, trypsinized, and resuspended in 3 ml of 1× PBS, and fluorescence was immediately read in a PerkinElmer Life Sciences 650-10S fluorescence spectrometer at 503 nm for excitation and 529 nm for emission with a slit width of 5 nm for both excitation and emission monochromators. Background readings from cells incubated without DCF-DA were subtracted. Results are expressed as arbitrary units of fluorescence per milligram of protein. MTT Assay—Cytotoxicity of BSO to pCI-neo, mE10, and mE27 cells was determined by the MTT assay. Cells (1.5 × 104) per milliliter per well were plated onto a 24-well plate and incubated in 5% CO2 at 37 °C. The MTT assay was performed using the Cell Titer 96 nonradioactive proliferation assay kit (Promega). Briefly, 15% volume of dye solution was added to each well after the appropriate incubation time. After 4 h of incubation at 37 °C, an equal volume of solubilization/stop solution was added to each well for an additional 1-h incubation. The absorbance of the reaction solution at 570 nm was recorded. The absorbance at 630 nm was used as a reference. The net A570-A630 was taken as the index of cell viability. The net absorbance change taken from the wells of untreated cultured cells was used as the 100% viability value. The percentage of viability was calculated by the formula (A570-A630)sample/(A570-A630)control × 100. Aconitase Activity—The mitochondrial aconitase activity was measured by using the Bioxytech Aconitase-340™ spectrophotometric assay kit (OxisResearch, Portland, OR) and following the instructions from the manufacturer. The aconitase activity is calculated according to the rate of the formation of NADPH, which is monitored by the increase in absorbance at 340 nm. Flow Cytometry Analysis of the Mitochondrial Membrane Potential—Changes in the mitochondrial membrane potential were examined by monitoring the cells after staining with rhodamine 123 (24Lemasters J.J. Nieminen A.L. Biosci. Rep. 1997; 17: 281-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Cells (5 × 105) were seeded onto 6-well plates. After treatment, the cells were then incubated with medium containing 5 μg/ml rhodamine 123 for 30 min. Cells were harvested by trypsinization and resuspended in 1 ml of minimal essential medium. The intensity of rhodamine 123 fluorescence was analyzed by flow cytometry. Statistics—Results refer to mean ± standard deviation and are average values from 2-3 values/experiment; experiments were repeated at least twice. Groups were compared among themselves by using Student’s t test for unpaired data. Differences at p < 0.05 were considered significant. Induction of Mitochondrial CYP2E1 by Ethanol in Rat Liver—Ethanol has long been known to elevate levels of CYP2E1 in the ER (1Lieber C.S. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 517-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (787) Google Scholar). Initial experiments evaluated whether CYP2E1 is present in rat liver mitochondria and whether ethanol feeding elevates mitochondrial CYP2E1. Liver samples from rats fed with ethanol (Fig. 1, indicated by E) or isocaloric dextrose (indicated by C) were homogenized, and the mitochondria and microsomes as well as total cell extracts were prepared. The liver mitochondrial preparations were routinely checked for purity by marker enzyme assay as described (19Robin M.A. Anandatheerthavarada H.K. Fang J.K. Cudic M. Otvos L. Avadhani N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24680-24689Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar); the microsome-specific, NADPH-cytochrome p450 reductase activity in the mitochondrial compartment was less than 1% (data not shown), indicating very little contamination of the mitochondria by microsomes. The induction of mitochondrial-specific CYP2E1 by ethanol consumption was studied by immunoblot analysis of a mitoplast preparation from ethanol-(E) or dextrose-(C) fed rat livers. As shown in Fig. 1, ethanol induced the level of CYP2E1 in total cell extract (TCE) and in microsomes (Micro) about 2-fold. In the liver of the dextrose control mice, CYP2E1 in the mitochondrial compartment was detected in low amounts (about 10% of that in microsomes). mtCYP2E1 was induced by chronic consumption of ethanol about 3-fold. To ascertain the purity of the mitochondria, the membrane was blotted with antibodies to the ER-specific protein GRP78 and mitochondria-specific proteins cytochrome c (indicated by Cyto. C) and Mn-SOD. The results showed that GRP78 protein was detected in microsomes and TCE fractions, but there was no detectable GRP78 in the mitochondrial fraction, although cytochrome c and Mn-SOD were strongly detected in the mitochondrial fraction (Fig. 1). These results validate the presence of CYP2E1 in the mitochondria (19Robin M.A. Anandatheerthavarada H.K. Fang J.K. Cudic M. Otvos L. Avadhani N.G. J. Biol.

Overexpression of Mitochondrial CYP2E1 in HepG2 Cells—Two cell lines overexpressing mitochondrial CYP2E1 (mE10 and mE27) and one cell line transfected with empty vector (pCI-neo) were selected and used in the following experiments. Fig. 2 shows Western blot analysis for CYP2E1 in TCE, post-mitochondrial supernatant from TCE centrifuged at 21,000 g for 10 min (post Mito sup), and mitochondria (Mito) compartments in these HepG2 cell lines as well as E47 cells, which express wild type CYP2E1 in the ER (25Chen Q. Cederbaum A.I. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 53: 638-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). In TCE, full-length CYP2E1 was present in the E47 cells with a molecular mass of 52 kDa; no aminoterminal truncated form of CYP2E1 was detected. However, a 40-kDa band was present in mE10 and mE27 cells upon interaction with the CYP2E1 antibody, and no full-length 52-kDa form was detected. The 40-kDa band was not present in the E47 cells or in the pCI-neo transfected HepG2 cells. However, all of the samples showed equal amounts of β-actin expression (Fig. 2, TCE). The 40-kDa bands in mE10 and mE27 cells were very faint in the post-mitochondrial supernatant. It is likely that these faint 40-kDa bands were from the residual contamination of mitochondria in the post-mitochondrial supernatant and not mtCYP2E1, which is not translocated into the mitochondria, because similar faint Mn-SOD (a mitochondrial enzyme) bands were also detected in the post-mitochondrial supernatant of all of these four cells (Fig. 2, post Mito sup). These results indicate that the 40-kDa mtCYP2E1 was located almost exclusively in the mitochondrial, but not in the cytosolic, compartment. We did not detect any truncated precursor, Δ(1Lieber C.S.

The properties determined for DHRS6 suggest a possible physiological role in cytosolic ketone body utilization, either as a secondary system for energy supply in starvation or to generate precursors for lipid and sterol synthesis. Hepatic ketone body formation and utilization of these compounds by peripheral tissues with high energy demands is essential in humans and other mammals for survival during times of starvation and extended fasting. The compounds categorized as ketone bodies comprise acetoacetate, R-β-hydroxybutyrate, and acetone, the last being a nonmetabolizable decarboxylation product of acetoacetate. The liver produces and excretes ketone bodies during times when the amount of acetyl-CoA exceeds the oxidative capacity of hepatic mitochondria. Ketone body formation is thus necessary to maintain β-oxidation by supplying free CoA. This metabolic situation occurs when high amounts of fatty acids derived from peripheral tissues during starvation or fasting are oxidized by β-oxidation pathways. In exacerbated disease states, such as ketoacidotic coma, extremely high amounts of fatty acids are oxidized as a consequence of insulin resistance in diabetes mellitus. In this situation, a potentially life-threatening metabolic acidosis occurs through the high amounts of protons provided by acetoacetate and R-β-hydroxybutyrate, exceeding the serum bicarbonate buffer capacity. Serum levels of 5-10 mm ketone bodies are reached under these circumstances as compared with levels of 1 mm in normal states. The liver synthesizes acetoacetate through the enzymes thiolase, hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA synthase, and hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA lyase from three molecules of acetyl-CoA, thus producing 1 mol of acetoacetate, 1 mol of acetyl-CoA, and 2 mol of free CoA. Acetoacetate is further reduced to R-β-hydroxybutyrate through mitochondrial R-β-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase, driven by high levels of NADH in hepatic mitochondria. Peripheral tissues take up ketone bodies and oxidize (R)-hydroxybutyrate back to acetoacetate, which is then ultimately converted into acetyl-CoA entering the tricarboxylic acid cycle.

The enzyme belongs to the short chain dehydrogenase/reductase superfamily (6Jornvall H. Persson B. Krook M. Atrian S. Gonzalez-Duarte R. Jeffery J. Ghosh D.

At present, well over 4000 members are deposited in sequence data-bases, and about 50 three-dimensional structures comprising 20-30 distinct enzymatic activities are available (6Jornvall H. Persson B. Krook M. Atrian S. Gonzalez-Duarte R. Jeffery J. Ghosh D. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 6003-6013Crossref PubMed Scopus (1154) Google Scholar, 7Kallberg Y. Oppermann U. Jornvall H. Persson B.

Biol. Interact. 2003; 143: 247-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar). Within the human genome, we have previously identified about 70 members of this superfamily (7Kallberg Y. Oppermann U. Jornvall H. Persson B. Protein Sci. 2002; 11: 636-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 9Oppermann U.C. Filling C. Jornvall H. Chem. Biol. Interact. 2001; 130: 699-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Of these human genes, about one-third are still functionally largely uncharacterized, and about 15 human members have been structurally determined. Here we describe the functional and structural annotation of human DHRS6 as a novel, cytosolic type II R-β-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase. Human DHRS6 or any other species ortholog represents a previously completely uncharacterized member of the SDR family. The human DHRS6 gene and a putative pseudogene with 95% amino acid sequence identity (DHRS6L) are found on chromosomes 4q24 and 6q16.3, respectively. Human DHRS6 and its vertebrate orthologs show high levels of sequence identities to bacterial hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenases (30-40%) (Fig. 1, A and B). This level is higher than that of any other human paralog SDR (30%). Furthermore, a phylogenetic analysis (Fig. 1B) establishes a clear relationship between prokaryotic BDHs and the vertebrate DHRS6 cluster. This finding prompted us to investigate the possibility that DHRS6 acts as hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase. Cloning, Expression, and Purification of Human DHRS6 and DHRS6L—N-terminally His6-tagged variants encoding human DHRS6 and DHRS6L constructs were expressed in the Escherichia coli expression strain BL21(DE3) in TB medium. For bacterial expression, the coding sequences for human DHRS6 (gi|14754051) and DHRS6L (gi|14754051) were codon-optimized for expression in E. coli. The genes were synthesized (Genscript) and subcloned into a modified pET vector using NdeI and BamHI sites, resulting in an N-terminal His6 tag and an engineered TEV protease site and a C-terminal sequence of Gly-Ser before the stop codon. High level soluble protein production was achieved by isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside induction (0.5 mm) at 18 °C for 12 h. Whereas expression of soluble DHRS6 was observed, soluble DHRS6L expression proved to be unsuccessful. Cells from DHRS6 cultures were disrupted in a high pressure homogenizer, and the resulting cell lysate was centrifuged for 40 min at 15,000 × g. The clarified supernatant was then subjected to immobilized metal affinity chromatography (Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid resin; Qiagen) and eluted in 250 mm imidazole, 500 mm NaCl, 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 5% glycerol. This was followed by a final gel filtration chromatographic step on a Superdex 200 HiLoad 26/60 column (GE Healthcare, Uppsala, Sweden). DHRS6 was purified in 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, containing 2 mm tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine, 5% (w/v) glycerol, and concentrated to 18.3 mg/ml using a 30,000-kDa molecular mass cut-off Amicon Ultra concentration device (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA). This two-step purification resulted in a homogenous protein preparation (Fig. 2). The experimentally determined mass by electrospray ionization-time-of-flight mass spectrometry (Agilent LC-MSD TOF) was in agreement with the predicted mass value. Crystallization of Human DHRS6—Immediately prior to crystallization, 5 mm NADH (Sigma) was added to the concentrated DHRS6 protein. 50 nl of the protein (at 18.3 mg/ml) was mixed with 100 nl of crystallization solution containing 30% polyethylene glycol monomethylether 5000, 0.2 m ammonium sulfate, and 0.1 m MES, pH 6.5 (Molecular Dimensions Screen I). The crystals were obtained by using the sitting drop vapor diffusion technique at 20 °C. Data Collection, Processing, and Refinement—A single crystal was transferred to a cryoprotectant consisting of mother liquor and supplemented to a final glycerol concentration of 20% and then flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen. A data set extending to a resolution of 1.84 Å was collected from this crystal on an R-AXIS HTC imaging plate area detector mounted on a Rigaku F-RE SuperBright rotating anode generator (both from Rigaku MSC) operating at 45 kV and 45 mA. Data were indexed, integrated, and scaled using the programs MOSFLM version 6.2.5 and SCALA version 5.0. Initial phases were calculated by molecular replacement implemented by Phaser version 1.3.1. The search model was an SDR structure with the Protein Data Bank code 1NFF (product of the Rv2002 gene from Mycobacterium tuberculosis). The first maps were of sufficient quality to allow the deletion of incorrect regions and adjustment of the amino acid sequence to the DHRS6 sequence. Starting from this model, 50 cycles of automated model building were carried out using the program ARP/wARP. Water molecules were automatically picked by ARP/wARP and later checked manually for appropriate density and hydrogen-bonding pattern. The final rounds of manual model building and refinement were carried out in Coot and REFMAC version 5.02.0005, respectively. Docking Analysis of DHRS6—A molecular three-dimensional model of the substrate molecule (R)-3-hydroxybutyrate was generated using the Dundee PRODRG2 server (available on the World Wide Web at davapc1.bioch.dundee.ac.uk/programs/prodrg/) and saved in the Protein Data Bank format. This molecule and the structure of DHRS6 were loaded into the program ICM (available on the World Wide Web at www.molsoft.com) (10Totrov M. Abagyan R. Proteins. 1997; (Suppl. 1): 215-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar) and converted into the internal coordinates format that includes the addition of hydrogen atoms to the protein model. Both molecules were submitted to the small molecules docking protocol, using pseudoenergy grid potentials to represent the protein molecule and fully flexible ligand molecule as described (10Totrov M. Abagyan R. Proteins. 1997; (Suppl. 1): 215-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar) and implemented in ICM. The active site pocket was easily identified and consisted of a closed cavity inaccessible to the solvent located at the nicotinamide ring end of the bound cofactor molecule. The χ-1 angle of Ser133 was modified to bring the active site to the probable catalytic conformation. The thoroughness parameter was set to 10. The resulting poses of the ligand after docking were individually analyzed. Substrate Screening and Determination of Kinetic Constants—Enzyme activities were measured as NAD(P)(H)-dependent hydroxydehydrogenase activities of various hydroxybutyryl derivatives. Nucleotide cofactors and d/l-hydroxybutyryl-CoA were from Sigma, and R and S isomers of hydroxybutyrate and hydroxyisobutyrate were obtained from Fluka. Activities were determined by the change of absorbance at 340 nm, using a molar extinction coefficient for NAD(P)H of 6220 m-1 cm-1. Recordings were carried out with a SpectraMax2 (Amersham Biosciences) instrument. Reactions were performed in 1.0-ml volumes or in 96-well microtiter plates in 200-μl volumes at different temperatures and pH values. A linear relationship between product formation and reaction time or amount of enzyme was established and used in subsequent experiments. For determination of kinetic parameters, the substrate concentrations were varied at least between 20 and 500% of an estimated Km value. Kinetic constants were calculated from initial velocity data by direct curve fitting to the Michaelis-Menten equation (V = Vmax×Sh/(Kmh + Sh); h = 1) using nonlinear regression analysis and the Prism software package (GraphPad). Subcellular Localization of Human DHRS6—For localization studies, the full-length coding sequence of human DHRS6 was cloned into different Living Colors™ Vectors (BD Biosciences Clontech, Heidelberg, Germany), resulting in fluorescent protein-tagged constructs. N-terminal green fluorescent protein (GFP) tags were achieved by subcloning into pEGFP-C2; C-terminal tags were constructed by cloning into pAcGFP1-N1. Primers used for amplification of DHRS6 for subcloning into GFP expression vectors were as follows: pEGFP-C2/DHRS6-for (TATAGAATTCATGGGTCGACTTGATGGGAAAGTCATC), pEGFP-C2/DHRS6-rev (TTAAGGATCCTCACAAGCTCCAGCCTCCATCAATG), pAcGFP1-N1/DHRS6-for (TATAAAGCTTATGGGTCGACTTGATGGGAAAGTCATC), and pAcGFP1-N1/DHRS6-rev (TTAACCGCGGCAAGCTCCAGCCTCCATCAATGATG). Generated constructs were subsequently verified by sequencing on an ABI 3730 DNA analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). The human cell line HeLa was maintained in minimal essential medium, 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen) at 37 °C and 5% CO2. About 5 × 104 HeLa cells were plated out in 6-well plates containing glass coverslips, transiently transfected with 1 μg of DNA, 3 μl of FuGENE 6 Transfection Reagent (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's protocol, and studied after an incubation time of 24 h. For staining of endoplasmic reticulum or mitochondria, cells were incubated under growth conditions for 30 min with fresh medium containing 1 μm ER-Tracker Blue-White DPX or 300 nm Mito Tracker Orange CMTMRos (stains by Molecular Probes, Karlsruhe, Germany), respectively. Cells were washed twice with PBS and fixed for fluorescence microscopy by incubation for 10 min at growth conditions in medium containing 3.7% formaldehyde. For staining the nucleus, fixed cells were incubated for 2 min under growth conditions with fresh medium containing 300 nm 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole solution (in H2O; stain by Sigma). Cells were washed twice in PBS, mounted on slides with VectaShield mounting medium (VectorLabs, Grünberg, Germany), and examined with an Axiophot epifluorescence microscope (Zeiss) using a × 40 oil immersion objective. Three-channel optical data were collected with an ISIS system (Metasystems, Altlussheim, Germany). Expression, Purification, and Substrate Analysis of Human DHRS6— Whereas human DHRS6 could be expressed and purified in a rapid two-step chromatography procedure (Fig. 2A), yielding about 20 mg of soluble protein per liter of culture, the DHRS6L protein could not be expressed solubly. Gel filtration experiments show that the DHRS6 protein fraction elutes at a position indicating that its solution state is tetrameric (Fig. 2B). A substrate screening using a spectrophotometric assay with a variety of hydroxybutyryl derivatives reveals that the purified enzyme is active toward (R)-β-hydroxybutyrate but not toward the S enantiomer or toward the (R)- or (S)-hydroxybutyryl-CoA derivatives or toward (S)- or (R)-hydroxyisobutyrate (Table 1). Steady-state kinetic experiments show that R-β-hydroxybutyrate is oxidized with a Vmax of about 82.3 nmol × min-1 × mg-1 and a Km of 9.1 mm (Table 1) at 30 °C and at pH 9.0. At pH 7.5, DHRS6 oxidizes (R)-OH butyrate with a Vmax of 31.9 nmol × min-1 × mg-1 and a Km of 12.6 mm. The enzyme follows a Michaelis-Menten kinetic pattern (Fig. 1C), and no signs for allosteric behavior were observed. The enzyme is specific for NAD+ and shows a Km for this cofactor of 59.8 μm (cf. Table 1).TABLE 1Kinetic analysis for human DHRS6 Experiments were carried out in the indicated buffer system at saturating concentrations for the second substrate ((R)-OH butyrate (50 mm) or NAD+ (1 mm), respectively). Screening experiments for activities with (S)-OH butyrate, dl-OH-butyryl-CoA, and NADP+ were carried out at 1 mm NADP+, 50 mm (S)-OH-butyrate, and 125 mm dl-OH-butyryl-CoA, respectively, at pH 9.0.

The crystallographic asymmetric unit of human DHRS6 consists of four monomers (A-D), four NAD+ molecules, four sulfate molecules, and 869 water molecules. The final model contains residues 1-246 of chain A, residues 2-246 of chain B, and residues 2-245 of chains C and D. A Ramachandran plot (Procheck) indicates that 92% of the residues are in the most favored regions, and the remaining 8% are in the additional allowed (7.5%) and generously allowed (0.5%) regions. The 245-residue core domain of human DHRS6 (without residues introduced through cloning) forms a single α/β domain typical of SDR enzymes (Fig. 3). The topology is based on the Rossmann fold, with a seven-stranded parallel β-sheet (βA-βG), which is sandwiched between three α-helices on each side (αB-αG) (Fig. 3B). Additional secondary structural elements are inserted between βF and αG and consist of two short helices (αFG1 (residues Asp182-Arg191) and αFG2 (residues Asn194-Arg205), connected by a turn introduced through Arg192 and Gly193. Furthermore, two short strands (βFG1 (Thr179-Asp181) and βFG2 (Phe211-Thr213)) preceding helices αFG1 and αG (Fig. 3C) are found. This region is the most dissimilar found in SDR enzymes and constitutes large parts of the substrate binding region (cf. Fig. 3C). Comparison of subunits of DHRS6 and rat type II hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase with bound NAD+ and acetoacetate (11Powell A.J. Read J.A. Banfield M.J. Gunn-Moore F. Yan S.D. Lustbader J. Stern A.R.

DHRS6 thus displays a prototype quaternary arrangement as observed in several SDRs (e.g. bacterial 3α/20β-HSD, rat type II HADH, or murine MLCR) (11Powell A.J. Read J.A. Banfield M.J. Gunn-Moore F.

Cofactor Binding and Active Site Architecture of Human DHRS6—The structure of DHRS6 was solved in complex with NAD+, and well defined electron density is observed for all parts of the cofactor molecule. NAD+ binds in an extended conformation (14.3 Å between C2 of nicotinamide and C6 of the adenine ring), with the adenine ring in anti conformation and syn for the nicotinamide ring, consistent with B-face 4-pro-S hydride transfer. DHRS6 shows an unusual sequence motif (TAAAQGIG instead of TGXXXGIG found in the majority of SDRs), which determines the turn between βA and αB, necessary to accommodate the pyrophosphate moiety of the cofactor (6Jornvall H.

Structure. 1994; 2: 629-640Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). The degree of variability in this basic and critical SDR motif is also observed in Drosophila ADH, which has the sequence VAALGIG (15Benach J. Atrian S. Gonzalez-Duarte R. Ladenstein R. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 289: 335-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The active site is a deep cleft, with the NAD+ cofactor forming the bottom of the active site cavity. The active site is flanked on one site by a long loop from Asn80 to His87, connecting βD and αE, and on the other side by the loop connecting βD-αF and reaches further into helix αF (residues Ser132-Lys150). Within this cavity, the catalytic residues of DHRS6 are found at homologous positions previously identified in other SDR-type dehydrogenases (6Jornvall H. Persson B. Krook M. Atrian S. Gonzalez-Duarte R. Jeffery J. Ghosh D. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 6003-6013Crossref PubMed Scopus (1154) Google Scholar, 16Filling C. Berndt K.D. Benach J. Knapp S. Prozorovski T. Nordling E.

These residues comprise Ser133, Tyr147, and Lys151 (Fig. 4A). Furthermore, the characteristic polar contacts between Tyr147, Lys151, the 2′- and 3′-OH of the nicotinamide, and the water contacts involving the main chain carbonyl of conserved Asn105 and the side chain of Lys151, indicate a possible proton relay (16Filling C. Berndt K.D. Benach J. Knapp S. Prozorovski T. Nordling E. Ladenstein R. Jornvall H. Oppermann U. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25677-25684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar) (data not shown). The side chain of Asn105 binds to the main chain amide of Phe84, thus introducing a characteristic kink in helix αE, a structural motif found in the majority of SDR structures determined to date (16Filling C. Berndt K.D. Benach J. Knapp S. Prozorovski T. Nordling E. Ladenstein R. Jornvall H. Oppermann U. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25677-25684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar). Within the active site, a sulfate molecule derived from the crystallization solution, forms hydrogen bonds with the basic residues Arg144, Arg188, and Arg205 (Fig. 4A). These residues are found to be highly conserved in the DHRS6 cluster as well as the bacterial BDHs identified above (Fig. 1A). This suggests a conserved binding mode of this “triple R” motif to a negatively charged substrate group. The interaction described presumably closes the active site, by moving helices αFG1 (contacts between Arg188-SO4: 2.9 and 3.0 Å) and αFG2 (contacts between Arg205-SO4: 3.1 and 2.8 Å) toward helix αF (contacts between Arg144-SO4: 2.9 and 2.9 Å) (Fig. 4A). Substrate docking of hydroxybutyrate into the active site of human DHRS6 was performed. The results generated by the docking protocol were then analyzed, and we present here the best solution satisfying the catalysis conditions. The three conserved arginines (Arg188, Arg144, and Arg205) are coordinating the carboxyl group of (R)-3-hydroxybutyrate, whereas the catalytic residues Ser133 and Tyr147 are interacting with the carbonyl group. This results in the positioning of the C3-S hydrogen of (R)-hydroxybutyrate facing toward the nicotinamide ring of the cofactor, in close proximity (3.2 Å) for its transfer to the position C4 of NAD+ (Fig. 4B). Subcellular Localization of Human DHRS6—Reporter experiments with either N- or C-terminally GFP-tagged human DHRS6 transfected into HeLa cells reveal a fluorescence pattern consistent with a cytoplasmic localization (Fig. 5). Moreover, no mitochondrial (Fig. 5) or endoplasmic reticulum (data not shown) targeting is observed using mitochondrial fluorescence dyes as reporter, thus distinguishing DHRS6 further from type 1 BDH. Human DHRS6 and its vertebrate orthologs represent a striking example of structural and functional conservation between pro- and eukaryotic species. The high degree of sequence conservation and the confirmed overlapping substrate specificities between prokaryotic BDHs and human DHRS6 allow us to predict that prokaryotic members of this DHRS6/BDH cluster share significant structural similarities, as observed and discussed in the structure presented in this report. The similarities observed are not only found in the regular SDR sequence motifs defined earlier (6Jornvall H. Persson B. Krook M. Atrian S. Gonzalez-Duarte R. Jeffery J. Ghosh D.

The enzymes described in this report are thus clearly different from mammalian type 1 (mitochondrial) BDH (sharing about 20% sequence identities), mammalian 3-hydroxyisobutyrate dehydrogenases involved in valine catabolism (18Hawes J.W.

https://openalex.org/W2081720049,"Sec14 protein was first identified in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, where it serves as a phosphatidylinositol transfer protein that is essential for the transport of secretory proteins from the Golgi complex. A protein domain homologous to Sec14 was identified in several mammalian proteins that regulates Rho GTPases, including exchange factors and GTPase activating proteins. P50RhoGAP, the first identified GTPase activating protein for Rho GTPases, is composed of a Sec14-like domain and a Rho-GTPase activating protein (GAP) domain. The biological function of its Sec14-like domain is still unknown. Here we show that p50RhoGAP is present on endosomal membranes, where it colocalizes with internalized transferrin receptor. We demonstrate that the Sec14-like domain of P50RhoGAP is responsible for the endosomal targeting of the protein. We also show that overexpression of p50RhoGAP or its Sec14-like domain inhibits transferrin uptake. Furthermore, both P50RhoGAP and its Sec14-like domain show colocalization with small GTPases Rab11 and Rab5. We measured bioluminescence resonance energy transfer between p50RhoGAP and Rab11, indicating that these proteins form molecular complex in vivo on endosomal membranes. The interaction was mediated by the Sec 14-like domain of p50RhoGAP. Our results indicate that Sec14-like domain, which was previously considered as a phospholipid binding module, may have a role in the mediation of protein-protein interactions. We suggest that p50RhoGAP provides a link between Rab and Rho GTPases in the regulation of receptor-mediated endocytosis.

We suggest that p50RhoGAP provides a link between Rab and Rho GTPases in the regulation of receptor-mediated endocytosis. Endocytosis has a crucial role in the delivery of extracellular molecules to various intracellular compartments. The regulation of endocytosis is still poorly understood. Several routes and mechanisms of endocytosis were identified in eukaryotic cells (1Mellman I. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1996; 12: 575-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (1346) Google Scholar). Among them, receptor-mediated endocytosis involves the internalization of receptors and their ligands by clathrin-coated pits. This process is essential for the efficient uptake of nutrients such as iron or lipids, and it is also involved in cellular signaling. Internalized receptors first enter the early endosome, from where they can either return to the plasma membrane or enter the endocytic recycling compartment (ERC). 2The abbreviations used are: ERC, endocytic recycling compartment; BRET, bioluminescence resonance energy transfer; GAP, GTPase activating protein; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; GFP, green fluorescent protein; BFA, brefeldin A; YFP, yellow fluorescent protein; EGF, epidermal growth factor; siRNA, small interfering RNA. Through endocytic recycling, receptors are re-utilized several times, and recycling is also essential for maintaining the proper lipid composition of the plasma membrane. ERC is a complex network of vesicles and tubules that is often localized around the microtubule-organizing center (2Hopkins C.R. Gibson A. Shipman M. Strickland D.K. Trowbridge I.S. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 1265-1274Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar, 3Lin S.X. Gundersen G.G. Maxfield F.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 96-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Sorting in the ERC is a complex process where most molecules return to the plasma membrane, although transport also occurs to the trans-Golgi network. Small GTPases, including members of the Rab and Rho families, are involved in the organization of receptor-mediated endocytosis. Rab GTPases regulate the budding, trafficking, and fusion of endocytic vesicles at the different compartments (4Zerial M. McBride H. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 107-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (2730) Google Scholar, 5Gaborik Z. Hunyady L. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 2004; 15: 286-293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Rab5, one of the best characterized Rab GTPases, has a role in the formation of sorting endosomes. Rab5 together with early endosomal antigen 1 regulates fusion between endocytic vesicles and sorting endosomes (6Simonsen A. Lippe R. Christoforidis S. Gaullier J.M. Brech A. Callaghan J. Toh B.H. Murphy C. Zerial M. Stenmark H. Nature. 1998; 394: 494-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (922) Google Scholar). Besides participating in the regulation of fusion, Rab5 is also being recognized as an important link between microtubules and endosomes, thus having a role in the regulation of the movement of endosomes. Rab11 is present in the ERC and trans-Golgi-network membranes and has a role in the regulation of endocytic recycling (7Ullrich O. Reinsch S. Urbe S. Zerial M. Parton R.G. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 913-924Crossref PubMed Scopus (1084) Google Scholar). Several data suggest that members of the Rho family also participate in the regulation of receptor-mediated endocytosis. Rac1 and RhoA regulate the internalization of ligand-bound receptors (8Lamaze C. Chuang T.H. Terlecky L.J. Bokoch G.M. Schmid S.L. Nature. 1996; 382: 177-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar), whereas RhoD and RhoB were described to associate with endocytic compartments (9Murphy C. Saffrich R. Grummt M. Gournier H.

Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 617-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). The Cdc42 protein, which is a key regulator of cell polarity, was described to have a role in the endocytosis of EGF-receptors (11Lin Q. Lo C.G. Cerione R.A. Yang W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10134-10138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 12Wu W.J. Tu S. Cerione R.A. Cell. 2003; 114: 715-725Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar), and it also regulates endocytosis in polarized epithelial cells (13Kroschewski R. Hall A. Mellman I. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 8-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). The activity of small GTPases is controlled by guanine nucleotide exchange factors, GTPase activating proteins (GAPs), and guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitors (14Geyer M. Wittinghofer A. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1997; 7: 786-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). According to data base searches there are at least 60 different Rho GTPase activating proteins (15Bernards A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1603: 47-82PubMed Google Scholar). The exact biological role of these regulatory proteins is poorly understood, and we know even less about how their activity is controlled. A common feature of small GTPase regulators is that besides their regulatory domains they also contain various conserved protein domains which represent potential sites for regulation and target these proteins to various intracellular compartments (16Bernards A. Settleman J. Trends Cell Biol. 2004; 14: 377-385Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Although much is known about the intracellular distribution of Rho GTPases, the subcellular localization and molecular interactions of their regulatory proteins remain elusive. We were interested in the intracellular localization and function of the p50RhoGAP protein. P50RhoGAP (also called Cdc42GAP) was the first identified GTPase activating protein for Rho GTPases (17Barfod E.T. Zheng Y. Kuang W.J. Hart M.J. Evans T. Cerione R.A. Ashkenazi A. J. Biol.

The protein was purified from human spleen and found to increase the endogenous GTPase activity of Rho, Rac, and Cdc42 (17Barfod E.T. Zheng Y. Kuang W.J. Hart M.J. Evans T. Cerione R.A. Ashkenazi A.

The GAP domain is located at the C terminus, and a proline-rich sequence motif is present between the two domains. Crystallization studies revealed the structure of the GTPase activating domain of p50RhoGAP both alone and in complex with Cdc42 (19Rittinger K. Walker P.A. Eccleston J.F. Nurmahomed K. Owen D.

Musacchio A. Smerdon S.J. Eccleston J.F. Nature. 1997; 385: 458-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Importantly, a crystal structure of the yeast Sec14 protein, which shows substantial homology to the N-terminal part of p50RhoGAP, was also determined (21Sha B. Phillips S.E. Bankaitis V.A. Luo M. Nature. 1998; 391: 506-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Recent data suggest that p50RhoGAP exists in an autoinhibited conformation stabilized by amino acids 1–48 and 169–197, and the prenyl group of small GTPases has a role in releasing the intramolecular inhibition (22Moskwa P. Paclet M.H. Dagher M.C. Ligeti E. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 6716-6720Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In contrast to the progress in structural analysis, we have little information about the biological function of this protein. Here we describe that p50RhoGAP is localized to endosomal membranes via the N-terminal Sec14-like domain of the protein and colocalizes with internalized transferrin and EGF receptor during endocytosis. We show that overexpression of the Sec14-like domain or the full-length GAP protein inhibits transferrin uptake. We also demonstrate that the Sec14-like domain forms a molecular complex with Rab11, providing a link between Rab and Rho GTPases in the process of endocytosis. Alexa568-transferrin, Alexa647-transferrin, Alexa488-EGF, Alexa488 anti-rabbit Fab, and Alexa568 anti-rabbit Fab were obtained from Molecular Probes (Carlsbad, CA). Cy3 anti-rabbit Fab was from Jackson Immunoresearch (West Grove, PA). Anti-rabbit-horseradish peroxidase was from Amersham Biosciences. Brefeldin A was obtained from Calbiochem. Nocodazole, monensin, and all other chemicals were from Sigma. Glutathione S-transferase (GST)-p50RhoGAP full-length plasmid and GST-p50RhoGAP-(198–439) were generously provided by Alan Hall. RhoGAP antibody was purified from rabbit serum after intracutaneous injections of glutathione S-transferase-p50GAP-(198–439) fusion protein into rabbits. The serum was affinity-purified using Affi-Gel 10 beads (Bio-Rad) loaded with the antigen. HeLa cells were grown in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium with GlutaMAX I (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin in a 5% humidified CO2 incubator at 37 °C. Transfections were carried out using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) or Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). siRNA was transfected at 100 nm concentrations 48 h before the experiments using Oligofectamine (Invitrogen). The target sequences on p50RhoGAP mRNA started at 875 nucleotides from the start codon (see Fig. 1) and at 127 nucleotides from the start codon (not shown). The siRNA was synthesized either by the Ambion Silencer siRNA construction kit (Ambion inc, Austin, TX) or ordered from Qiagen (Hilden, Germany). Scrambled siRNAs with identical nucleotide composition were used as controls. To create fluorescent protein-tagged p50RhoGAP constructs, the full-length p50RhoGAP coding sequence was amplified from glutathione S-transferase-p50RhoGAP using 5′-CCGCTCGAGGCCATGGATCCGCTCTCAGAGCTGCAGG-3′ and 5′-GGAATTCGGAGCCCGCTGGGGTCCGGGCTTG-3′ PCR primers, and after digestion the PCR product was ligated between the XhoI and EcoRI sites of pEGFP-N1 vector. Sec14-GFP construct was produced similarly using 5′-GGAATTCCCTTCTGTGTGGATTTCAGGAAGTCGTC-3′ as the antisense primer. The YFP and RedFP constructs of p50RhoGAP and of Sec14 domain were constructed using the same restriction sites. The L173D single amino acid change mutants of Sec14GFP, Sec14YFP, Sec14V5, p50GFP, p50YFP, and p50V5 and the R282A mutant of p50GFP were produced using the Stratagene QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit following the manufacturer's instructions. To verify mutations, mutant plasmids were sequenced. GFP-Rab5 and GFP-Rab11 used in this work were described earlier in Hunyady et al. (23Hunyady L. Baukal A.J. Gaborik Z. Olivares-Reyes J.A. Bor M. Szaszak M. Lodge R. Catt K.J. Balla T. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 1211-1222Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). The RedFP-C1 plasmid used to create red fluorescent protein-Rab11 was described in Campbell et al. (24Campbell R.E. Tour O. Palmer A.E. Steinbach P.A. Baird G.S. Zacharias D.A. Tsien R.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7877-7882Crossref PubMed Scopus (2015) Google Scholar). Microscopic Analysis of Transferrin Uptake—HeLa cells on coverslips were incubated in extracellular medium (called H-medium, which contained 145 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 0,8 mm CaCl2, 10 mm HEPES, 5 mm glucose, pH 7.4) for 20 min at 37 °C, then medium was replaced with H-medium containing 10 μg/ml Alexa568-transferrin for the indicated times. Flow Cytometric Analysis of Transferrin Uptake—HeLa cells grown in 12-well plates were transfected with the Sec14-GFP or p50GFP constructs 24–30 h before the assay. After incubation in H-medium for 20 min, 10 μg/ml Alexa647-transferrin was added to the cells for the indicated times. Cells were then washed once with ice-cold H-medium then 2× with ice-cold PBS, and then trypsin-EDTA was added for 2 min at 37 °C. Dislodged cells were resuspended and washed once in ice-cold PBS and then fixed in 1% paraformaldehyde for 15 min. Finally, cells were washed 3× in PBS and kept at 4 °C until flow cytometric measurement was done. GFP intensity was measured in FL-1, and Alexa647 intensity of GFP-positive cells was measured in FL-4. The correct gating of GFP-positive cells was set using nontransfected cells as negative controls. Flow Cytometric Analysis of Transferrin Recycling—HeLa cells grown in 12-well plates were transfected with the Sec14-GFP or p50GFP constructs 24–30 h before the assay. After loading the cells with 10 μg/ml Alexa647-transferrin in H-medium for 30 min at 37 °C, cells were washed 2× with ice-cold H-medium and then incubated in “chase” medium (H-medium containing 10% fetal calf serum, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 100 μg/ml transferrin) for the indicated times at 37 °C. Finally, cells were washed once in ice-cold chase medium without transferrin and two times in ice-cold PBS, trypsinized, and processed further for flow cytometric measurements as described above. Where indicated, 50 μm monensin was added 30 min before labeled transferrin and was present during the whole experiment. Cells lysed on ice in Laemmli sample buffer were boiled and run on 10% polyacrylamide gels. After blotting onto nitrocellulose membranes, blocking was carried out in PBS, 5% milk, and 0.1% Tween 20 for 1 h at room temperature. After incubating the membranes with the first antibody for 1 h at room temperature, membranes were washed 5× in PBS 0.1% Tween 20, horseradish peroxidase-labeled anti-rabbit secondary antibody was used in a 1:5000 dilution, and signals were detected on FUJI Super RX films using the enhanced chemiluminescence method. Immunofluorescent Labeling and Confocal Laser Microscopy—Cells grown on coverslips were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS then rinsed 5× in PBS and incubated for 10 min in PBS containing 100 mm glycine. Coverslips were washed 2× in PBS and permeabilized in PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin and 0.1% Triton X-100 for 20 min at room temperature. After 1 h of blocking in PBS containing 3% bovine serum albumin, cells were incubated with the primary antibody in PBS plus 2% bovine serum albumin, washed thoroughly 6× in PBS, and incubated with the secondary antibody for 1 h and finally washed 6× in PBS again. Coverslips were mounted using Mowiol 4–88 antifade reagent (prepared from polyvinyl alcohol 4–88, glycerol, H2O and Tris, pH 8.5). Confocal images were collected on an LSM510 laser scanning confocal unit (Carl Zeiss) with a 63× 1.4 numerical aperture plan Apochromat and a 40× 1.3 numerical aperture plan Neofluar objective (Carl Zeiss). Excitation was with 25-milliwatt argon laser emitting 488 nm and a 1.0-milliwatt helium/neon laser emitting at 543 nm. Emissions were collected using a 500–530-nm band pass filter to collect Alexa488 and GFP and a 560-nm long pass filter to collect Alexa568 and red fluorescent protein emission. Usually images from optical slices of 1–2-μm thickness were acquired. Cross-talk of the fluorophores was negligible. Bioluminescence Resonance Energy Transfer (BRET) Measurements—HeLa cells were plated on 96-well plates (1.5 × 104 cells/well) appropriate for luminescent measurements and transfected on the same day using FuGENE 6 transfection reagent. Bioluminescence resonance energy transfer was measured the next day on a Mithras LB940 (Bertold Technologies) multilabel reader using F485 (20 nm) and F530 (25 nm) band pass filters for coelenterazine and YFP emission, respectively. For the standard, normalized BRET ratio, energy transfer between luciferase Rab11 constructs and YFP-tagged p50RhoGAP constructs was calculated as described earlier (25Angers S. Salahpour A. Joly E. Hilairet S. Chelsky D. Dennis M. Bouvier M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3684-3689PubMed Google Scholar): [(530-bg)YFP-transfected cells/(480-bg)YFP-transfected cells]-[(530-bg)V5*transfected cells/(480-bg)V5-transfected cells], where bg is the background count from nontransfected cells, and the asterisk (*) represents nonfluorescent V5 epitope-tagged p50RhoGAP plasmid, used as the control. P50RhoGAP Is Present on Endosomal Membranes—We were interested in the intracellular localization of the p50RhoGAP protein. We raised a polyclonal antibody against the human p50RhoGAP protein. Because commercially available antibody failed to recognize p50RhoGAP (data not shown), we have carried out a rigorous characterization of our antibody preparation. As is shown in Fig. 1, the antibody detected a single 50-kDa protein band in HeLa cells (Fig. 1A) and also in several other cell lines, including A431, HepG2, HL60, SH-SY5Y (data not shown). To verify that the antibody detects p50RhoGAP, we expressed a p50RhoGAP-GFP fusion protein in HeLa cells, and the antibody detected the fusion protein as well. (Fig. 1A). We used a p50RhoGAP-specific siRNA to decrease p50RhoGAP protein level. We detected inhibition of p50RhoGAP expression by Western blot and immunofluorescence (Fig. 1, B and C), thus providing a final proof for the specificity of our antibody. We obtained identical result by using another p50RhoGAP-specific siRNA that was designed to target a different sequence in the p50RhoGAP mRNA (data not shown). Next we used confocal microscopy to determine the intracellular distribution of endogenous p50RhoGAP. In HeLa cells, we observed strong juxtanuclear staining, whereas less intense signal was observed over the cytoplasm (Fig. 2A). A similar staining pattern was observed in A431 cells and in the SH-S5Y neuroblastoma cells (data not shown). When HeLa cells were transfected with p50RhoGAP-GFP fusion protein, we observed similar juxtanuclear localization of the recombinant protein (Fig. 2D). Because both endocytic compartments and the Golgi complex are located in the vicinity of the nucleus, we investigated the localization of p50RhoGAP in relation to these organelles. First we examined the localizations of p50RhoGAP and transferrin receptor, a well characterized marker for endosomes. When the cells were stained for the transferrin receptor, we observed significant overlap of the two signals in the perinuclear region (Fig. 2, B and C). Similarly to the endogenous protein, the p50RhoGAP-GFP fusion protein also showed colocalization with transferrin receptor (Fig. 2, E and F). The perinuclear localization of endosomal compartments is maintained by anchoring to microtubules (3Lin S.X. Gundersen G.G. Maxfield F.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 96-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined the effect of the microtubule-depolymerizing agent nocodazole on the distribution of p50RhoGAP. As is shown in Fig. 2, G and H, nocodazole treatment caused redistribution of p50RhoGAP from the perinuclear region to the entire cytoplasm. Next we studied the effect of low temperature (4 °C), a condition that also interferes with the polymerization of microtubules. Fig. 2I shows that after incubation at 4 °C, p50RhoGAP did not localize to the perinuclear region but became distributed throughout the cytoplasm. In the next experiments we incubated the cells with Alexa-labeled transferrin and examined the relation of internalized transferrin to p50RhoGAP localization in time. At 0 min, p50RhoGAP showed dispersed staining due to previous incubation on ice that reversibly disturbs microtubules (Fig. 3, A–C). After 5 min of incubation, internalized transferrin localized to punctuate structures in the cytosol, which did not show overlap with the p50RhoGAP signal (Fig. 3, D–F). These structures likely correspond to early endosomes. After 30 min of incubation at 37 °C, the bulk of internalized transferrin was localized to the perinuclear region where it showed strong colocalization with p50RhoGAP (Fig. 3, G–I). Transfected p50RhoGAP-GFP fusion protein also showed colocalization with internalized, Alexa-labeled transferrin after 30 min of incubation (Fig. 3, J–L). These results suggest that p50RhoGAP is present in the endocytic compartments. The Golgi complex is also localized in the vicinity of the nucleus; therefore, we were interested if some portion of p50RhoGAP was localized to the Golgi apparatus. We treated HeLa cells with brefeldin A (BFA), which rapidly disrupts Golgi membranes (26Lippincott-Schwartz J. Yuan L.C. Bonifacino J.S. Klausner R.D. Cell. 1989; 56: 801-813Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1315) Google Scholar). As is shown in Figs. 4, A and B, the localization of p50RhoGAP was not affected by the BFA treatment. On the contrary, the same treatment caused a rapid redistribution of Cdc42 from the perinuclear region to the cytosol (Fig. 4, C–D), indicating the effectivity of the BFA treatment. This result suggested that p50RhoGAP was not localized to the Golgi complex. Based on its in vitro substrate preference toward Cdc42, p50RhoGAP was originally described as Cdc42GAP. Because the BFA treatment had a different effect on the localization of the two proteins, we became interested in knowing if the overexpression of p50RhoGAP has any effect on the distribution of endogenous Cdc42. When compared with untransfected cells, overexpression of p50RhoGAP-GFP had no effect on the distribution of Cdc42 (Fig. 4, E–G), and although both proteins localized to the vicinity of the nucleus, they did not show colocalization. This result suggested that Cdc42 was unlikely to represent the in vivo substrate of p50RhoGAP. Although the transferrin receptor undergoes constitutive endocytosis, internalization of the EGF receptor is induced by the receptor-ligand binding. In experiments using Alexa-labeled EGF, we could show that p50RhoGAP also localized to endosomes when endocytosis was initiated by receptor ligand binding (data not shown). Sec14 Domain of p50RhoGAP Is Responsible for the Endosomal Targeting—We went on to determine which part of the protein was responsible for the endosomal localization. P50RhoGAP is a 439-amino acid protein that contains an N-terminal domain homologous to the yeast Sec14 protein (27Aravind L. Neuwald A.F. Ponting C.P. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 195-197Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We expressed the isolated Sec14-like domain as a GFP fusion protein and studied the intracellular localization of the protein. Similarly to the whole-length protein, Sec14-GFP localized to the perinuclear region where it co-localized with internalized transferrin (Fig. 5, A–C) and the transferrin receptor (data not shown). High level expression of the Sec14 domain induced the formation of enlarged, immobile vesicular and tubular structures, which were also present in the cell periphery (Fig. 5. D–E) and were positive for labeled transferrin. In other experiments we introduced a point mutation into the Sec14-like domain. The Leu-173 residue is present in the yeast Sec14 protein at identical positions, and according to crystallographic studies, it contributes to the formation of the hydrophobic lipid binding surface in yeast Sec14 (21Sha B. Phillips S.E. Bankaitis V.A. Luo M. Nature. 1998; 391: 506-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). HeLa cells expressed the mutant protein in similar amounts to the wild-type Sec14-like domain, but the protein showed diffuse cytoplasmic localization without enrichment in the perinuclear region (Fig. 5F). The L173D mutation also inhibited the perinuclear localization of the p50RhoGAP protein (Fig. 5G). We mutated the conserved amino acid Arg-282 in the GAP domain and Pro-235 in the proline-rich region of p50RhoGAP; however, these mutations failed to change the localization of the protein (data not shown). In summary, these experiments suggested that the Sec14-like domain localizes p50RhoGAP to endosomes. When we studied the colocalization of Sec14-GFP with fluorescent transferrin, we noticed that cells which expressed the Sec14-like domain showed a diminished transferrin uptake (Fig. 6, A and B). To further characterize this effect, we used flow cytometry to measure transferrin uptake. In these experiments we also observed an inhibitory effect of the Sec14-like domain (Fig. 6C), whereas overexpression of the L173D mutant Sec14-GFP did not affect transferrin uptake (Fig. 6D). In further experiments we examined if the overexpression of Sec14-like domain had any effect on endosomal recycling. To answer this question we preloaded the cells with Alexa-transferrin and measured its release in the presence of unlabeled transferrin. Figs. 6, E and F, show that the Sec14-like domain also interfered with endosomal recycling, and this inhibitory effect was not present when we used the L173D mutant form of the protein. Next we examined if the inhibitory effect on endosomal recycling was entirely responsible for the reduced transferrin uptake. In these experiments we preincubated the cells in the presence of monensin, an inhibitor of endosomal recycling (28Basu S.K. Goldstein J.L. Anderson R.G. Brown M.S. Cell. 1981; 24: 493-502Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). In our experiments the inhibitory effect of monensin was confirmed by measuring a complete inhibition of the chase of Alexa647-transferrin from loaded HeLa cells (not shown). Importantly in monensin-treated cells the Sec14-like domain still effectively inhibited the uptake of transferrin (Fig. 6, G and H), indicating that beside inhibiting endosomal recycling, the Sec14-like domain interferes with earlier steps of the endocytic process. Overexpression of p50RhoGAP Inhibits Transferrin Uptake—After seeing the drastic effect of the Sec14-like domain on transferrin uptake, we sought to determine whether overexpression of the full-length p50RhoGAP protein has any effect on transferrin uptake. We overexpressed the p50RhoGAP as a GFP fusion protein and studied the transferrin uptake of the cells. Similarly to the Sec14-like domain, the full-length protein inhibited transferrin uptake (Fig. 7A). Interestingly the R282A mutant form of the protein, which has no intrinsic GAP activity, also inhibited transferrin uptake (Fig. 7B), whereas the L173D mutation abrogated the inhibition (Fig. 7C). These experiments highlighted the importance of the Sec14-like domain in the activity of the full-length protein as well. P50RhoGAP Interacts with Rab11 through Its Sec14-like Domain— Members of the Rab family have an important role in endocytic trafficking. Among them Rab11 was shown to be present on the ERC, where it probably regulates traffic through th"

Such a role is further supported by the presence of dwarfism in mice overexpressing STC1. Yet, the STC 1 inhibitory effect on growth may be related to both postnatal metabolic abnormalities and prenatal defective bone formation. In our study, we used an organ culture system to evaluate the effects of STC on growth plate chondrogenesis, which is the primary determinant of longitudinal bone growth. Fetal rat metatarsal bones were cultured in the presence of recombinant human STC (rhSTC). After 3 days, rhSTC suppressed metatarsal growth, growth plate chondrocyte proliferation and hypertrophy/differentiation, and extracellular matrix synthesis. In addition, rhSTC increased the number of apoptotic chondrocytes in the growth plate. In cultured chondrocytes, rhSTC increased phosphate uptake, reduced chondrocyte proliferation and matrix synthesis, and induced apoptosis. All these effects were reversed by culturing chondrocytes with rhSTC and phosphonoformic acid, an inhibitor of phosphate transport. The rhSTC-mediated inhibition of metatarsal growth and growth plate chondrocyte proliferation and hypertrophy/differentiation was abolished by culturing metatarsals with rhSTC and phosphonoformic acid. Taken together, our findings indicate that STC1 inhibits longitudinal bone growth directly at the growth plate. Such growth inhibition, likely mediated by an increased chondrocyte phosphate uptake, results from suppressed chondrocyte proliferation, hypertrophy/differentiation, and matrix synthesis and by increased apoptosis. Last, the expression of both STC1 and its binding site in the growth plate would support an autocrine/paracrine role for this growth factor in the regulation of growth plate chondrogenesis.

As new cartilage is continuously formed, calcified cartilage at the metaphyseal border of the growth plate is replaced by bone tissue (25Aharinejad S. Marks S.C. Bock P. Mackay C.A. Larson E.K. Tahamtani A. Mason-Savas A. Firbas W. Anat. Rec. 1995; 242: 111-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Thus, the rate of long bone growth depends primarily on the rate of chondrogenesis in the growth plate. To determine whether STC1 regulates longitudinal bone growth, we first studied STC1 and STC binding site expression in the rat metatarsal growth plate. Then, we cultured rat metatarsal bone rudiments in the presence of recombinant human STC (rhSTC) and assessed its effects on metatarsal linear growth, growth plate chondrocyte proliferation and hypertrophy/differentiation, cartilage matrix synthesis, and apoptosis. Last, we evaluated the effects of rhSTC on growth plate chondrocyte phosphate uptake and the relationship between phosphate uptake modifications and growth plate chondrogenesis. Organ Culture—The second, third, and fourth metatarsal bone rudiments were isolated from Sprague-Dawley rat fetuses at 20 days postconception and cultured individually in 24-well plates (26Bagi C. Burger E.H. Calcif. Tissue Int. 1989; 45: 342-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 27Wu S. De Luca F. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 4642-4647Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Each well contained 0.5 ml minimum essential medium (MEM) (Invitrogen) supplemented with 0.05 mg/ml ascorbic acid (Sigma), 1 mm sodium glycerophosphate (Sigma), 0.2% bovine serum albumin (BSA, Sigma), 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen). Bone rudiments were cultured for 3 days in a humidified incubator with 5% CO2 in air at 37 °C. The medium was changed on day 2. In the first set of experiments, metatarsals were cultured for 3 days in serum-free medium in the absence or presence of rhSTC (0-100 ng/ml). For rhSTC production, the open reading frame of human STC without Met was amplified by PCR and cloned into the bacterial expression vector pQE-30 that contained an N-terminal His6 tag for subsequent affinity purification (10Yoshiko Y. Maeda N. Aubin J.E. Endocrinology. 2003; 144: 4134-4143Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In the second set of experiments, the bone rudiments were cultured in the presence of rhSTC (100 ng/ml) with or without phosphonoformic acid (PFA, 0.3 mm), a known inhibitor of phosphate transport. Control bones were treated with equal volumes of vehicle (PBS plus 0.1% BSA). Animal care was in accordance with the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (DHEW Publication (National Institutes of Health) 85-23, revised 1988). Chondrocyte Culture—Metatarsal rudiments were rinsed in PBS, then incubated in 0.2% trypsin for 1 h and 0.2% collagenase for 3 h. Cell suspension was aspirated repeatedly and filtered through a 70-μm cell strainer, rinsed first in PBS then in serum-free Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium, and counted. Chondrocytes were seeded in 100-mm dishes at a density of 4×106 cells/10 ml in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium with 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 50 μg/ml ascorbic acid, and 10% FBS. The culture medium was changed at 72-h intervals. Confluent cells were trypsinized and grown in 24-well plates at the density of 1×104/ml in the same medium and allowed to return to 70-80% confluence. In Situ Ligand Binding Assay—To detect the expression of STC binding site in the growth plate, in situ ligand binding was performed using an STC-alkaline phosphatase (STC-AP) fusion protein (a gift from Dr. Graham Wagner, University of Western Ontario, Canada) (28McCudden C.R. James K.J. Hasilo C. Wagner G.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 47: 4549-4558Google Scholar). Paraformaldehyde-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue sections were dewaxed, rehydrated, and equilibrated in Hanks’ balanced salt solution (containing 0.1% BSA, pH 7.5) (HBHA) before incubation with 0.5 nm STC-AP fusion protein, AP, or STC-AP fusion protein plus 1 μm rhSTC in HBHA for 90 min at room temperature. Thereafter, the tissue sections were washed in HBHA with 0.1% Tween and fixed for 30 s in 60% acetone, 3% formaldehyde in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5. Endogenous alkaline phosphatase activity was inactivated by a 60-min incubation in HBHA at 65 °C. Color development of ligand-associated AP activity was then initiated at room temperature by the addition of AP liquid substrate (nitro blue tetrazolium/5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate). Finally, slides were washed in distilled water to stop the reaction and mounted. A negative control slide was obtained by preparing the slide without AP-STC1 fusion protein addition. Measurement of Longitudinal Growth—The length of each bone rudiment was measured under a dissecting microscope using an eyepiece micrometer. To calculate the metatarsal growth rate, length measurements were performed daily during the culture period. 5-Bromo-2′-deoxyuridine (BrdUrd) in Situ Incorporation—After 3 days in culture, BrdUrd was added to the culture medium at a final concentration of 10 μm (29Naski M.C. Colvin J.S. Coffin D'Ornitz D.M. Development. 1998; 125: 4977-4988Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Bone rudiments were incubated for an additional 5 h. At the end of the incubation, all bones were fixed in 4% phosphate-buffered paraformaldehyde, embedded in paraffin, and cut in 5-7-μm-thick longitudinal sections. Bone sections were stained for BrdUrd according to the manufacturer’s protocol (Roche Applied Science). The BrdUrd-labeling index was calculated as the number of BrdUrd-labeled cells per grid divided by the total number of cells per grid. The grid circumscribed a portion of the growth plate zone (epiphyseal or proliferative) analyzed through a 40× objective and generally contained an average of 50 cells. For each growth plate zone, the fraction of labeled cells in three distinct grid locations was calculated and averaged. For each treatment group, 10 bones were sampled, and 3 growth plate sections of each bone were analyzed. The labeling index (number of labeled cells/total cells) was determined separately for the epiphyseal zone and for the proliferative zone. All determinations were made by the same observer blinded to the treatment category. Quantitative Histology—At the end of the culture period, metatarsals were fixed in 4% phosphate-buffered paraformaldehyde overnight. After routine processing, three longitudinal, 5-7-μm-thick sections were obtained from each metatarsal bone and stained with toluidine blue. From each of the three sections, we measured the height of the epiphyseal zone, proliferative zone, hypertrophic zone, and of the ossification center and calculated the average value. In the metatarsal growth plate, the epiphyseal zone is characterized by small and rounded cells irregularly arranged in the cartilage matrix. The proliferative zone comprises cells with a flattened shape arranged in columns parallel to the longitudinal axis of the bone. In the hypertrophic zone, large cells (defined by a height ≥9 μm) form a layer adjacent to the calcified region of the metatarsal bone, the primary ossification center. All quantitative histology was performed by a single observer blinded to the treatment category. In Situ Hybridization—Metatarsals were fixed overnight in 4% paraformaldehyde at 4 °C, then dehydrated in ethanol and embedded in paraffin. Sections were hybridized to 35S-labeled antisense riboprobes. Slides were exposed to photographic emulsion at 4 °C for 4 days, then developed, fixed, and cleared. Sections were counterstained with hematoxylin and viewed using a light microscope. Sections hybridized with a labeled-sense riboprobe were used as negative controls. The mouse type X collagen (Col10a1) probe (a gift from Dr. Bjorn Olsen, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA) was a 650-bp HindIII fragment containing 400 bp of non-collagenous (NC1) domain and 250 bp of 3′-untranslated sequence of the mouse Col10a1 gene in pBluescript (30Apte S. Seldin M. Hayashi M. Olsen B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 206: 217-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Immunohistochemistry—Bone rudiments were fixed overnight in 4% paraformaldehyde and embedded in paraffin. 5-7-μm-thick longitudinal sections were obtained and deparaffined in xylene and rehydrated in graded ethanol. Sections were incubated in 1% H2O2 for 10 min followed by 3 rinses with PBS. For digestion, 0.1% trypsin for 12 min was used at room temperature followed by a triple wash in PBS. After preincubation with 1.5% blocking serum for 30 min at room temperature, sections were incubated for 30 min at room temperature with rabbit anti-STC polyclonal antibody (1:200) (6Olsen H.S. Cepeda M.A. Zhang Q.Q. Rosen C.A. Vozzolo B.L. Wagner G.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1792-1796Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar), rabbit polyclonal antisera raised against mouse type X collagen peptides, anti-NC2 domain (1:200) (31Lunstrum G.P. Keene D.R. Weksler N.B. Cho Y.-J. Cornwall M. Horton W. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1999; 47: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), or goat anti-collagen II antibody (1:200) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA). The secondary antibody was an anti-rabbit or anti-goat antibody conjugated with biotin (ABC staining system, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), applied for 30 min at a dilution of 1:200. This step was followed by incubation for 30 min with avidin and biotinylated horseradish peroxidase. The sections were then visualized with peroxide substrate for 5 min and mounted with Permount medium. Control experiments were performed using normal rabbit or goat serum instead of the primary antibody. Cultured primary chondrocytes grown on sterile glass coverslips were treated with or without STC (100 ng/ml) for 24 h before being fixed in cold methanol for 5 min at -10°C and dried. Cells were blocked with 1.5% normal blocking serum in PBS for 1 h and then incubated in goat anti-collagen II antibody (1:50) for 30 min followed by an incubation for 30 min with avidin and biotinylated horseradish peroxidase. Cells were then visualized with peroxide substrate for 5 min, counterstained with hematoxylin, and mounted with Permount medium. Control experiments were performed using normal goat serum instead of the primary antibody. In Situ Cell Death—At the end of the culture period, metatarsals were fixed in 4% phosphate-buffered paraformaldehyde, embedded in paraffin, and cut in 5-7-μm-thick longitudinal sections. From each bone, three sections parallel to the long axis of the bone were obtained. Apoptotic cells in the growth plate were identified by terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate nick end labeling, according to the manufacturer’s instructions (TDT-FragEL kit; Oncogene Research Products, Boston, MA) with slight modifications (deparaffinized and rehydrated sections were treated with proteinase K for 10 min instead of 20 min) (32Wu S. Legido A. De Luca F. J. Child Neurol. 2004; 19: 26-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). A positive control was generated by covering the entire tissue section with 1 μg/μl DNase I in 1 × TBS/1 mm MgSO4 after proteinase K treatment, whereas a negative control was generated by substituting distilled H2O for the terminal deoxynucleoti-dyltransferase in the reaction mixture. All other steps were performed as described above (data not shown). Apoptosis was quantitated by determining the apoptotic index (calculated as the number of apoptotic cells per grid divided by the total number of cells per grid). The grid circumscribed a portion of the growth plate analyzed through a 40× objective and generally contained an average of 50 cells. For each growth plate, the fraction of labeled cells in three distinct grid locations was calculated and averaged. For each treatment group 10 bones were sampled and 3 growth plate sections of each bone were analyzed. Measurement of 35SO4 Incorporation into Proteoglycans (PGs)—As a measure of cartilage matrix synthesis, we assessed [35S]sulfate incorporation into PGs (26Bagi C. Burger E.H. Calcif. Tissue Int. 1989; 45: 342-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Na235SO4 (Amersham Biosciences, specific activity up to 100 mCi/mol), at a concentration of 5 μCi/ml, was added to the culture medium 3 h before the end of the 3-day culture period. The metatarsal rudiments were washed 3 times for 10 min with Puck’s saline solution and then digested in 1.5 ml of MEM with 0.3% papain at 60 °C for 16 h. They were then incubated with 0.5 ml of 10% cetyl pyridinium chloride (Sigma) in 0.2 m NaCl at room temperature for 18 h. At the end of the incubation, each precipitate was collected by filtration through filter paper (Whatman, Clifton, NJ), washed 3 times with 1 ml of 0.1% cetyl pyridinium chloride (Sigma) in 0.2 m NaCl, and dissolved in 0.5 ml of 23 n formic acid. The amount of radioactivity incorporated into PG was measured by liquid scintillation. Results are presented as total radiolabeled PG expressed in percent of control. The incorporation of [35S]sulfate into PG by cultured chondrocytes was assessed according the method of Venkatesan et al. (33Venkatesan N. Barré L. Benani A. Netter P. Magdalou J. Fournel-Gigleux S. Ouzzine M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 18087-18092Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Cells were labeled with 5 μCi/ml Na235SO4 for the last 6 h of the 24-h experimental period. PGs were extracted from the cell layer and culture medium with 3 m guanidine hydrochloride and precipitated by using 5% cetyl pyridinium chloride, and the PG synthesis rate was measured by liquid scintillation counting. The protein content was determined using the BCA protein assay, and the results are expressed as cellular and medium cpm/μg of protein. Western Blot—Whole cell lysates from cultured chondrocytes treated with/without 100 ng/ml STC for 24 h were solubilized with 1% SDS sample buffer and electrophoresed on a 4-15% SDS-PAGE gel (Bio-Rad). Proteins were transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane and were probed with rabbit polyclonal antibodies against caspase 3 and caspase 9 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The blots were developed using a horseradish-peroxidase-conjugated polyclonal goat-anti rabbit IgG antibody and enhanced chemiluminescence system (Amersham Biosciences). The protein size was confirmed by molecular weight standards (Invitrogen). Pi Chondrocyte Uptake—Chondrocytes in 70-80% confluence were washed with fresh serum-free medium containing 0.1% BSA and incubated with or without rhSTC (100 ng/ml) and/or PFA (0.1 mm). Before performing the Pi uptake assay, the cells were washed 3 times with 500 μl of washing buffer (150 mm choline chloride, 1.8 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, and 10 mm HEPES buffered with Tris-HCl, pH 7.4). For each treatment group, chondrocytes from three wells were used to determine Pi uptake, whereas chondrocytes from 3 more wells were trypsinized and counted with hemacytometer. Pi uptake was measured in 200 μl of washing buffer (150 mm NaCl instead of choline chloride) containing 1 μCi/ml NaPi (Amersham Biosciences) at 37 °C for 30 min. Cells were then washed 3 times with 500 μl of ice-cold washing buffer followed by solubilization in 0.2 n NaOH. Pi uptake was determined by liquid scintillation counting. The data were expressed as cpm. Flow Cytometry Assay—Apoptotic cell death was quantified by a flow cytometric assay based on the number of cells with fragmented DNA. Cultured chondrocytes were treated with/without STC 100 ng/ml for 24 h before being harvested by centrifugation and fixed in 80% ethanol that had been precooled to -20 °C. The cells were re-suspended in phosphate-buffered saline containing 50 μg/ml propidium iodide, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and 100 μg/ml RNase (Sigma) and incubated for 1 h. The number of cells with fragmented DNA was then quantified using 1-2×104 cells on a FACSort flow cytometer and the Cellquest analysis program (BD Biosciences). Reverse Transcription-PCR—At the end of the culture period, total RNA was extracted from the growth plates of 18 rat metatarsal bones using the Qiagen RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen Inc., Valencia CA). Primers specific for rat Pit-1 (5′ primer, 5′-TAGCTGTGTAAAATAGCCAGGTTTC-3′; 3′ primer, 5′-AGAAGTTGTCACATGTCAACAGAAC-3′; product size 342 bp) and rat FGF23 (5′ primer, 5′-CACTGCTAGAGCCTATTCAGACACT-3′;3′ primer, 5′-CTATTATCACTACGGAGCCAGCATC-3′; product size 200 bp) were used. The housekeeping gene β-actin (5′ primer, 5′-CTGACAGACTACCTCATGAAGATCC-3′; 3′ primer, 5′-CATAGAGGTCTTTACGGATGTCAAC-3′; product size 330 bp) was used as normalization control. The recovered RNA was further processed using 1st Strand cDNA synthesis kit for reverse transcription-PCR (avian myeloblastosis virus) (Roche Diagnostics) to produce cDNA. One microgram of total RNA and 1.6 μg of oligo-p(dT)15 primer were incubated for 10 min at 25 °C followed by incubation for 60 min at 42 °C in the presence of 20 units of avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase and 50 units of RNase inhibitor in a total 20-μl reaction. The cDNA products were directly used for PCR or stored at -80 °C for later analysis. The reaction (100 μl total volume) was performed using a PerkinElmer Life Sciences GeneAmp PCR system 9600 in the presence of 20 pmol of primers, 20 nmol of dNTP, 150 nmol of MgCl2,1× PCR buffer (Expand High Fidelity PCR buffer; Roche Applied Science), and 2.5 units of Expand High Fidelity DNA polymerase (Roche Applied Science). The conditions for amplification were 2 min 30 s at 96 °C followed by 35 cycles of denaturation for 45 s at 96 °C, annealing for 1 min at 55 °C, elongation for 1 min 30 s at 72 °C, and finally, extension for 10 min at 72 °C. PCR products were separated by electrophoresis in a 2% agarose gel with ethidium bromide (1.5 μg/ml). Statistics—All data are expressed as the mean ± S.E. Statistical significance was determined by t test or by analysis of variance. Expression of STC1 and STC Binding Sites in the Growth Plate—To determine whether STC1 regulates growth plate chondrogenesis in a paracrine/autocrine fashion, we first evaluated its protein expression by immunohistochemistry. STC1 was predominantly localized in the lower proliferative zone and in the hypertrophic zone of the growth plate (Fig. 1A). To detect the expression of the STC binding site, we then performed a ligand binding assay by employing a STC-AP fusion protein. The expression of the STC binding site was mainly detected in the lower proliferative and hypertrophic zones (Fig. 1C), with a pattern similar to that of the STC protein. Nonspecific binding was ruled out by using either AP alone or STC-AP plus 1 μm rhSTC (data not shown). No staining was observed in the growth plate of negative controls when either STC1 antibody or STC-AP fusion protein was omitted (Fig. 1B, and D, respectively). Effects of rhSTC on Longitudinal Bone Growth and Growth Plate Chondrogenesis—During the 3 days of the culture period, rhSTC induced a significant, concentration-dependent suppression of the metatarsal longitudinal growth (n = 63-86/group, p < 0.001, Fig. 2A). Because the rate of longitudinal bone growth depends primarily on the rate of growth plate chondrogenesis, we evaluated the effects of rhSTC on chondrocyte hypertrophy/differentiation and chondrocyte proliferation. To assess chondrocyte hypertrophy, we examined the bone rudiments histologically. After 3 days in culture, treatment with 100 ng/ml rhSTC reduced the height of the growth plate hypertrophic zone (n = 8/group, p < 0.05, Fig. 2B). We then evaluated the effects of rhSTC on chondrocyte differentiation by assessing the expression of collagen X (a marker of chondrocyte differentiation) in the growth plate by immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization. Compared with control metatarsal bones, STC-treated metatarsals exhibited a marked reduction of type X collagen protein and mRNA expression (Fig. 3A-B, and C-D, respectively). To study chondrocyte proliferation, we exa"
https://openalex.org/W1970929361,"Mutations in the presenilin 1 (PS1) gene are responsible for the early onset of familial Alzheimer disease (FAD). Accumulating evidence shows that PS1 is involved in γ-secretase activity and that FAD-associated mutations of PS1 commonly accelerate Aβ1–42 production, which causes Alzheimer disease (AD). Recent studies suggest, however, that PS1 is involved not only in Aβ production but also in other processes that lead to neurodegeneration. To better understand the causes of neurodegeneration linked to the PS1 mutation, we analyzed the development of tau pathology, another key feature of AD, in PS1 knock-in mice. Hippocampal samples taken from FAD mutant (I213T) PS1 knock-in mice contained hyperphosphorylated tau that reacted with various phosphodependent tau antibodies and with Alz50, which recognizes the conformational change of PHF tau. Some neurons exhibited Congo red birefringence and Thioflavin T reactivity, both of which are histological criteria for neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs). Biochemical analysis of the samples revealed SDS-insoluble tau, which under electron microscopy examination, resembled tau fibrils. These results indicate that our mutant PS1 knock-in mice exhibited NFT-like tau pathology in the absence of Aβ deposition, suggesting that PS1 mutations contribute to the onset of AD not only by enhancing Aβ1–42 production but by also accelerating the formation and accumulation of filamentous tau.

PS1 is required for γ-secretase to cleave amyloid precursor protein into Aβ species such as Aβ1–40 and Aβ1–42.

Masters C.L. Culvenor J.G. Neuroreport. 2002; 13: 719-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Interestingly, FTD is characterized by the appearance of NFTs without Aβ deposition (17Yoshiyama Y. Lee V.M. Trojanowski J.Q. Curr. Neurol. Neurosci. Rep. 2001; 1: 413-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). A patient harboring the G183V PS1 mutation displayed the clinical manifestations of FTD and exhibited phospho-tau-positive Pick body pathology throughout the cortex and limbic region, without Aβ deposition. Other reports have also shown that PS1 mutations accelerate NFT formation and neuronal loss without affecting the rate of Aβ deposition (18Gomez-Isla T. Growdon W.B. McNamara M.J. Nochlin D. Bird T.D. Arango J.C. Lopera F. Kosik K.S. Lantos P.L. Cairns N.J. Hyman B.T. Brain. 1999; 122: 1709-1719Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Thus, these data lead to the hypothesis that PS1 mutations might contribute to NFT formation as well as increase Aβ1–42 production in FAD. To investigate this hypothesis, we examined tau pathology in mutant PS1 I213T knock-in mice (19Nakano Y. Kondoh G. Kudo T. Imaizumi K. Kato M. Miyazaki J.I. Tohyama M. Takeda J. Takeda M. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1999; 11: 2577-2581Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). This line of mice was generated with a targeted insertion of the I213T missense mutation into exon 7 of the mouse PS1 gene using homologous recombination. Therefore, these PS1 mutant knock-in mice harbor the FAD mutation in the mouse PS1 gene and produce PS1 I213T. Heterozygote mutant PS1 I213T mice showed no change in Aβ1–40 levels but had increased levels of Aβ1–42,a 1.3-fold increase when compared with wild-type mice. This Aβ1–42 increase is comparable to that observed in human cases. Because this mouse strain shares the same PS1 genotype and related pathology as that of patients harboring the PS1 mutation, we initially expected these mice to develop the AD phenotype. The increase in murine Aβ1–42, however, failed to lead to a corresponding Aβ deposition, possibly because murine Aβ has a different amino acid sequence that reduces its tendency to aggregate. Using this dissociation to our advantage, we investigated the Aβ deposition-independent effects of the PS1 mutation in this mouse model. We found that GSK-3β activation was followed by the accumulation of hyperphosphorylated tau in the hippocampal region, which fulfills the histological criteria for the presence of NFTs. Animals—Mutant PS1 I213T knock-in mice (mPS1 mice) were maintained at the RIKEN BSI animal facilities according to the Institute guidelines for the treatment of experimental animals. Antibodies—The following antibodies were used: mouse monoclonal anti-tubulin (DM1A, Sigma); anti-ubiquitin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology); anti-GSK3β (Transduction Laboratory); anti-MAP2 (HM2, Sigma); anti-tau Alz50, which recognizes the conformational epitope of paired helical filaments (PHFs), component of NFT (a generous gift from Dr. P. Davies, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, NY); anti-phosphorylated tau AT8 (Innogenetics Zwijndrecht); anti-dephosphorylated tau, Tau-1 (Chemicon); rabbit polyclonal anti-tau JM (20Takashima A. Murayama M. Murayama O. Kohno T. Honda T. Yasutake K. Nihonmatsu N. Mercken M. Yamaguchi H. Sugihara S. Wolozin B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9637-9641Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar); anti-phosphorylated tau PS199, PS262, PS396, PS404, and PS422 (BIOSOURCE), which recognize tau phosphorylated at the indicated sites; and anti-GSK3β Ser-9 (Cell Signaling). Western Blot Analysis—Brains were homogenized in modified radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) buffer (50 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 5 mm EDTA, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, and 0.1% SDS, pH 8.0), and the suspension was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C in an Optima TL ultracentrifuge (Beckman). The pellet was washed five times with 1% SDS-Tris-buffered saline (TBS) (50 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, and 1% SDS, pH 8.0) followed each time by centrifugation. The SDS-insoluble pellet was solubilized in 70% formic acid, lyophilized, reconstituted in Laemmli SDS-PAGE sample buffer, and subjected to SDS-PAGE. Separated proteins were blotted onto Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore). The membranes were incubated with primary antibody then with the species-appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody. Immunoreactivity was visualized with a chemiluminescent detection system (ECL, Amersham Biosciences). Quantitation and visual analysis of immunoreactivity were performed with a computer-linked LAS-1000 Bio-Imaging Analyzer System (Fujifilm) using the software program Image Gauge 3.0 (Fujifilm). Glycogen Synthase Kinase (GSK)-3β Activity—Brains were homogenized in TBS (pH 7.4) and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C in an Optima TL ultracentrifuge (Beckman). Protein concentration in the supernatant was determined with a Bradford protein assay, and 10-μg samples were assayed for GSK-3β activity with an immunoprecipitation assay (21Van Lint J. Khandelwal R.L. Merlevede W. Vandenheede J.R. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 208: 132-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Ultrastructural Studies—For electron microscopy studies, SDS-insoluble materials were prepared from the brains of mPS1 mice as described above in the Western blot analysis section. The materials were mildly sonicated and dispersed in phosphate-buffered saline. The dispersed solution was absorbed onto glow-discharged supporting membranes on 400-mesh grids and prefixed by floating the grids on drops of 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 m phosphate buffer for 5 min. After washing, the grids were incubated with primary antibody (JM, anti-tau antibody), followed with a 5-nm colloidal gold-conjugated secondary antibody. The grids were then negatively stained with 2% sodium phosphotungstic acid, dried, and observed with a LEO 912AB electron microscope at 100 kV. Immunohistochemical and Histopathological Studies—Brains were immersion-fixed in 10%-buffered formalin, and paraffin-embedded sections (4 μm) were prepared. PS199, Alz50, anti-MAP2, and AT8 were used as primary antibodies. After reacting the sections with species-appropriate secondary antibodies, we visualized for light microscopy analyses immunoreactive elements by treating the sections with ABC followed by DAB using Peroxidase Stain DAB kits (Nacalai Tesque Japan). PS199 and anti-α-tubulin were used as primary antibodies for confocal laser microscopy analyses. Immunoreactive elements were visualized with Alexa568-conjugated anti-mouse IgG and Alexa488-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG, and then examined with a Radiance 2000 KR3 confocal microscope (Bio-Rad). We stained some sections with Congo red and Thioflavin T, which recognize the β-sheet structure of tau fibrils, and then examined them with a light microscope equipped with crossed polarizing filters (Nikon). NFTs were identified using a standard Gallyas silver-impregnation method, which is used to assess structural changes of the brain in AD (22Iqbal K. Braak E. Braak H. Zaidi T. Grundke-Iqbal I. Neurobiol. Aging. 1991; 12: 357-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The Aβ levels in the brains of mPS1 knock-in mice were quantified by sandwich enzyme-linked immunoassay (23Sun X. Cole G.M. Chu T. Xia W. Galasko D. Yamaguchi H. Tanemura K. Frautschy S.A. Takashima A. Neurobiol. Aging. 2002; 23: 195-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) and Western blot analysis. Similar to a previous report (19Nakano Y. Kondoh G. Kudo T. Imaizumi K. Kato M. Miyazaki J.I. Tohyama M. Takeda J. Takeda M. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1999; 11: 2577-2581Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), the level of Aβ1–42 was elevated in the brains of mPS1 mice compared with that in the brains of wild-type mice (wPS1 mice). Most of the Aβ1–40 and Aβ1–42 was recovered in the Triton X-100-soluble fraction, and very little was recovered in the 1% SDS-insoluble fraction, suggesting that neither Aβ1–40 nor Aβ1–42 aggregated and deposited within the brains of the mPS1 mice. Moreover, Aβ immunostaining in tissue sections was absent, suggesting again that neither extracellular nor intracellular Aβ accumulated in vivo (data not shown). Thus, murine Aβ failed to deposit in the brains of mPS1 mice, even though Aβ1–42 levels in these brains increased. Characterization of NFT-like Pathology in Mutant PS1 Mice—Five-month-old heterozygous mPS1 mice exhibited no pathological changes (Fig. 1A); however, in 7-month-old or older mice, we detected phospho-tau accumulation (PS199) in neurons in the hippocampal region (Fig. 1B). The prevalence and distribution of these PS199-positive neurons gradually increased and widened, respectively, with age, and in 14–16-month-old mice, we observed phospho-tau immunoreactivity in hippocampal CA3 neurons (Fig. 1D). By contrast, wPS1 mice did not show this pattern of phospho-tau immunoreactivity (Fig. 1, C and D). Alz50, an antibody that recognizes the conformational change of tau in PHF-tau, also labeled CA3 neurons (Fig. 1, E–G). In summary, these findings indicate that heterozygous mPS1 mice, whose alleles most precisely reflect the genotype of humans bearing this mutation, exhibited phospho-tau accumulation with PHF-tau epitopes, whereas wPS1 mice of the same age showed no sign of tau accumulation. Data related to the other histological criteria for NFTs confirmed these findings. In heterozygous mPS1 mice, we observed Congo red birefringence (Fig. 1, H–J) and Thioflavin T reactivity (Fig. 1K) in hippocampal neurons. The Gallyas silver staining method revealed argyrophillic neurons in the hippocampus of mPS1 mice (Fig. 1L). Argyrophillic and Congo red-positive neurons were less numerous than phospho-tau-positive neurons (less than 5% of phospho-tau-positive neurons). The tau-accumulating neurons of these mice also exhibited reduced α-tubulin immunoreactivity (Fig. 1, M and N) similar to that displayed by NFT-bearing neurons. As we previously showed in tau Tg mice (24Tatebayashi Y. Miyasaka T. Chui D.H. Akagi T. Mishima K. Iwasaki K. Fujiwara M. Tanemura K. Murayama M. Ishiguro K. Planel E. Sato S. Hashikawa T. Takashima A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 13896-13901Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar, 25Tanemura K. Murayama M. Akagi T. Hashikawa T. Tominaga T. Ichikawa M. Yamaguchi H. Takashima A. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 133-141Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), weaker α-tubulin immunoreactivity might indicate destruction of microtubules in tau-accumulating neurons in the mPS1 mice. TUNEL staining, however, revealed no signs of apoptosis in these neurons (Fig. 1, O–R). Taken together, these results suggest that mPS1 affects the cytoskeleton of hippocampal neurons and induces NFT-like accumulation of hyperphosphorylated tau. Biochemical and Ultrastructural Analysis of Tau in Mutant PS1 Mice— We confirmed the accumulation of NFT-like tau in mPS1 mice with biochemical and electron microscopy analyses. Because tau becomes detergent insoluble when aggregated, we assessed the amount of tau in the SDS-insoluble fraction derived from the brains of mPS1 mice. As shown in Fig. 2A, small amounts of tau were recovered in the SDS-insoluble fraction from 2-month-old mPS1 mice. The amount of tau recovered in the SDS-insoluble fraction increased with aging, and a large amount of tau was recovered from 14-month-old heterozygous mPS1 mice compared with age-matched wPS1 mice. (The amount of SDS-insoluble tau in mPS1 mice was ∼2% of the total tau in these mice). We also investigated the amount of SDS-insoluble tau in different brain regions of mPS1 mice. Tau was recovered from the hippocampus, and small amounts were recovered from the cerebral cortex, striatum, and cerebellum. This might be explained by the inverse correlation of NFT with pin1 expression (26Liou Y.C. Sun A. Ryo A. Zhou X.Z. Yu Z.X. Huang H.K. Uchida T. Bronson R. Bing G. Li X. Hunter T. Lu K.P. Nature. 2003; 424: 556-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). The SDS-insoluble material recovered from mPS1 mice were further investigated with electron microscopy. As shown in Fig. 2C, tau-positive fibrils were detected in the SDS-insoluble fraction. These fibrils appeared to be straight tubules, about 10 nm in diameter. The biochemical and ultrastructural analyses strongly suggest that NFT-like tau aggregation formed primarily in hippocampal neurons of mPS1 mice. The NFTs found in AD brains contain highly phosphorylated tau (27Lee V.M. Balin B.J. Otvos Jr., L. Trojanowski J.Q. Science. 1991; 251: 675-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (1226) Google Scholar). Hyperphosphorylation of tau leads to the formation of fibrillar tau (28Sato S. Tatebayashi Y. Akagi T. Chui D.H. Murayama M. Miyasaka T. Planel E. Tanemura K. Sun X. Hashikawa T. Yoshioka K. Ishiguro K. Takashima A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 42060-42065Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). To determine whether tau hyperphosphorylation also occurs in mPS1 mice, we examined the extent of tau phosphorylation in 14-month-old wPS1, heterozygous mPS1, and homozygous mPS1 mice (Fig. 2D). Immunoblotting with various phosphorylation-dependent anti-tau antibodies revealed that the amount of SDS-insoluble tau was nearly the same in heterozygous and homozygous mPS1 mice (Fig. 2D, tau(ins.)). This amount, however, was greater than that in wPS1 mice. Although the total amounts of tau in soluble fractions from the three types of mice were similar (i.e. bands had slower mobility than the unphosphorylated Tau-1-immunoreactive band) (Fig. 2D, tau(sol.)), the amounts of phosphorylated tau immunostained by PS199, PS262, PS396, PS404, PS422, and AT8 were elevated in the heterozygous and homozygous mPS1 mice compared with those in the wPS1 mice. The extent of tau phosphorylation at the AT8, PS422, and PS199 epitopes appeared to depend on the number of mPS1 alleles present in the mice, as shown by the comparatively greater immunosignal intensity of samples derived from homozygous than in heterozygous mPS1 mice, suggesting that mPS1 expression affects the hyperphosphorylation of tau. The immunostaining intensity of Tau-1, an antibody that recognizes unphosphorylated tau, also correlated with genotype. Tau-1 immunoreactivity was greater in samples derived from wPS1 mice than in heterozygous and homozygous mPS1 mice (wPS1 > heterozygous mPS1 > homozygous mPS1), confirming that mPS1 induced the hyperphosphorylation of tau. GSK-3β, Tau Kinase, and Tau Phosphatase Activity—Activation of GSK-3β, a known tau kinase, was also associated with mPS1 genotype. Although total GSK-3β levels were similar among wPS1, heterozygous mPS1, and homozygous mPS1 mice, inactive GSK-3β (GSK-3β phosphorylated at Ser-9) levels varied inversely with the number of mPS1 alleles present (Fig. 2D; GSK3β and GSK3β(Ser-9)). This inverse correlation was confirmed by comparing the GSK-3β activity in immunoprecipitated brain samples derived from wPS1, heterozygous mPS1, and homozygous mPS1 mice (Fig. 3B). This assay revealed elevated GSK-3β activity in heterozygous mPS1 compared with wPS1 mice (p < 0.05; n = 3), and also in homozygous mPS1 mice compared with heterozygous mice (p < 0.05; n = 3). Taken together, we conclude that the mutant PS1 activated GSK-3β, thereby enhancing tau phosphorylation and resulting in the formation of NFT-like tau aggregates (Figs. 1 and 2). These results support those from a previous report (20Takashima A. Murayama M. Murayama O. Kohno T. Honda T. Yasutake K. Nihonmatsu N. Mercken M. Yamaguchi H. Sugihara S. Wolozin B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9637-9641Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). We also investigated how other kinases and phosphatases may contribute to tau phosphorylation in mPS1 mice. As shown in Fig. 3A, levels of the active forms of phosphorylated JNK; phosphorylated MAP kinase; CDK5; the CDK5 activators p35 and p25; and PP2a were similar among wPS1, heterozygous mPS1, and homozygous mPS1 mice, indicating that the tau phosphorylation mediated by these enzymes are not affected by the PS1 mutation. Nonetheless, other mechanisms are expected to be involved in the mPS1-induced hyperphosphorylation of tau, because GSK-3β alone cannot phosphorylate all of the phosphorylation sites in tau. In the present study, we demonstrated that the brains of mice harboring a PS1 mutation accumulated NFT-like phospho-tau. Biochemical analysis of SDS-insoluble tau revealed tau fibrils. These NFT-like tau inclusions were similar to those observed in FTDP-17 mutant tau transgenic mice (24Tatebayashi Y. Miyasaka T. Chui D.H. Akagi T. Mishima K. Iwasaki K. Fujiwara M. Tanemura K.

Neuron. 2003; 40: 471-483Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar), and in Pin1 knock-out mice (26Liou Y.C. Sun A. Ryo A. Zhou X.Z. Yu Z.X. Huang H.K. Uchida T. Bronson R. Bing G. Li X. Hunter T. Lu K.P. Nature. 2003; 424: 556-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). The neurons of other PS1 knock-in and mutant PS1 transgenic mice; however, failed to show cytoskeletal changes (30Siman R. Reaume A.G. Savage M.J. Trusko S. Lin Y.G. Scott R.W. Flood D.G. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 8717-8726Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 31Guo Q. Sebastian L. Sopher B.L. Miller M.W. Ware C.B. Martin G.M. Mattson M.P. J. Neurochem. 1999; 72: 1019-1029Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). To create their mutant PS1 knock-in mice, Guo et al. (32Baki L. Shioi J. Wen P. Shao Z. Schwarzman A. Gama-Sosa M. Neve R. Robakis N.K. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 2586-2596Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar) used a hybrid mouse composed of 129SV and C57BL6 strains, whereas in the present study we used mice resulting from 10 generations of crossbreeding with C57BL6J mice. The genetic background of our mice, which is most likely to be different from the backgrounds of mice used in previously studies, could have influenced how the PS1 mutation contributed to NFT formation and cytoskeletal changes. Another possible explanation for the apparent discrepancy between our findings and others is that our PS1 knock-in mice harbored a different PS1 mutation from that harbored by mutant PS1 knock-in mice developed by other laboratories. Previously, we found certain PS1 mutations that increase Aβ1–42 levels are poor predictors for the onset of FAD (5Murayama O. Honda T. Mercken M. Murayama M. Yasutake K. Nihonmatsu N. Nakazato Y. Michel G. Song S. Sato K. Takahashi H. Takashima A. Neurosci. Lett. 1997; 229: 61-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Our present results, however, suggest that the accumulation of NFT-like tau could determine the onset of AD. These two differing outcomes would also explain why some PS1 mutations accelerate NFT formation and neuronal loss without accelerating Aβ deposition (18Gomez-Isla T. Growdon W.B. McNamara M.J. Nochlin D. Bird T.D. Arango J.C. Lopera F. Kosik K.S. Lantos P.L. Cairns N.J. Hyman B.T. Brain. 1999; 122: 1709-1719Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Thus, PS1 mutations that accelerate both NFT formation and Aβ1–42 production may further accelerate related neuropathologies, suggesting that the cause of early onset AD may be related to a PS1 mutation. The mechanism underlying the mutant PS1-associated accumulation of NFTs may involve the activation of GSK-3β. Our results indicate that GSK-3β is activated in our mPS1 knock-in mice; this is consistent with other mPS1 transgenic mice. Recently, wild-type PS1 has been shown to activate PI3 kinase/Akt signaling by promoting the association of cadherin and PI 3-kinase, whereas mutant PS1 was unable to do so (32Baki L. Shioi J. Wen P. Shao Z. Schwarzman A. Gama-Sosa M. Neve R. Robakis N.K. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 2586-2596Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Thus, mutant PS1 appears to impair PI 3-kinase/Akt signaling by affecting selected signaling receptors (33Kang D.E. Sang Yoon I. Repetto E. Busse T. Yermian N. Ie L. Koo E.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 31537-31547Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) or by reducing cadherin/PI3 kinase association (32Baki L. Shioi J. Wen P. Shao Z. Schwarzman A. Gama-Sosa M. Neve R. Robakis N.K. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 2586-2596Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar), which eventually leads to the activation of GSK-3β. Whereas the mutant PS1-associated activation of GSK-3β occurred in young mice, tau accumulation occurred only later on in older mice. This led us to hypothesize that, by some mechanism, phosphorylated tau degrades before it aggregates. This unknown mechanism is then inactivated during aging, leading to the accumulation and aggregation of tau that occurs in aged individuals. Patients harboring the FAD mutation of PS1 develop AD with 100% penetration. Based on our results, we propose that the PS1 mutation in FAD leads to the early onset of AD through the activation of GSK-3β, which leads to NFT formation and the loss of neurons and synapses. Moreover, we believe that the rate of GSK-3β activation is accelerated by extracellular Aβ oligomers. The exact molecular mechanism mediating the mutant PS1-induced activation of GSK-3β requires clarification to further our understanding of how AD develops."

The membrane lipids found in Archaea are a defining characteristic of this domain of life (1Woese C.R. Kandler O. Wheelis M.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 4576-4579Crossref PubMed Scopus (4402) Google Scholar). These lipids are based on a core architecture where branched-chain saturated hydrocarbons are connected to glycerol through ether linkages (2De Rosa M. Gambacorta A. Gliozzi A. Microbiol. Rev. 1986; 50: 70-80Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Koga Y. Nishihara M. Morii H. Akagawa-Matsushita M. Microbiol. Rev. 1993; 57: 164-182Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In hyperthermophiles, two diphytanylglyceryl units are often linked covalently through their hydrocarbon tails to form tetraether lipids that completely span the membrane. In addition, archaeal membrane lipids have three general characteristics that distinguish them from their bacterial and eukaryotic counterparts (4Kates M. Prog. Chem. Fats Other Lipids. 1978; 15: 301-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). First, the phospholipid backbone is built upon the opposite glycerol stereoisomer, sn-glycerol-1-phosphate (G1P), 4The abbreviations used are: G1P, sn-glycerol-1-phosphate; G3P, sn-glycerol-3-phosphate; GGGPS, (S)-3-O-geranylgeranylglyceryl phosphate synthase; Af, Archaeoglobus fulgidus; Bs, Bacillus subtilis; Mt, Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum; Ta, Thermoplasma acidophilum; TIM, triose phosphate isomerase; GGPP, geranylgeranyl diphosphate; MPD, 2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol; DMAPP, dimethylallyl diphosphate; SeMet, selenomethionine. 4The abbreviations used are: G1P, sn-glycerol-1-phosphate; G3P, sn-glycerol-3-phosphate; GGGPS, (S)-3-O-geranylgeranylglyceryl phosphate synthase; Af, Archaeoglobus fulgidus; Bs, Bacillus subtilis; Mt, Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum; Ta, Thermoplasma acidophilum; TIM, triose phosphate isomerase; GGPP, geranylgeranyl diphosphate; MPD, 2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol; DMAPP, dimethylallyl diphosphate; SeMet, selenomethionine. not the sn-glycerol-3-phosphate (G3P) backbone found in bacteria and eukaryotes. Second, the hydrophobic chains are isoprenoid derivatives instead of fatty acids. Third, the isoprenoid chains are bound to G1P through ether, not ester, linkages. Of these traits, the glycerol phosphate stereochemistry is the most distinctive because ether-linked lipids are known to exist in some eukaryotes and bacteria (5Paltauf F. Chem. Phys.

FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2002; 213: 133-139Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To date, however, there is no known exception to the G1P backbone stereochemistry of archaeal lipids or to the G3P backbone stereochemistry found in bacterial and eukaryotic lipids. The biosynthesis of archaeal membrane lipids is schematically illustrated in (Fig. 1). In brief, dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMAPP) and its isomer isopentenyl diphosphate are synthesized by a mevalonate-like pathway (2De Rosa M. Gambacorta A. Gliozzi A. Microbiol. Rev. 1986; 50: 70-80Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Boucher Y. Kamekura M. Doolittle W.F. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 52: 515-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Long isoprenoid chains are produced from these five-carbon precursors by consecutive condensations through the action of a prenyl diphosphate synthase. The committed step in archaeal lipid synthesis occurs with the formation of an ether linkage between G1P and an isoprenoid diphosphate, usually geranylgeranyl diphosphate (GGPP). Separate enzymes catalyze the sequential transfer of isoprenoid units onto the C-3 and C-2 hydroxyls of G1P, respectively (9Zhang D. Poulter C.D. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1993; 115: 1270-1277Crossref Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The enzyme catalyzing the first reaction, (S)-3-O-geranylgeranylglyceryl phosphate synthase (GGGPS), is a cytosolic protein that has previously been purified and enzymatically characterized from Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum (9Zhang D. Poulter C.D. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1993; 115: 1270-1277Crossref Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 10Chen A. Zhang D. Poulter C.D. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 14847-14854Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) and Thermoplasma acidophilum (12Nemoto N. Oshima T. Yamagishi A. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2003; 133: 651-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The enzyme catalyzing the second prenyltransfer, (S)-2,3-di-O-geranylgeranylglyceryl phosphate synthase, is an integral membrane protein which has recently been cloned and purified from Sulfolobus solfataricus (13Hemmi H. Shibuya K. Takahashi Y. Nakayama T. Nishino T. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 50197-50203Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In ensuing reactions the isoprenoid double bonds are reduced and various polar headgroups may be attached to the lipid. Synthesis of the aforementioned tetraether lipids still remains largely unexplored. GGGPS, the enzyme catalyzing the committed step in archaeal lipid synthesis, displays three major points of interest. First, it represents the branch point for membrane lipid biosynthesis in Archaea and imparts the unique G1P stereochemistry of the lipid backbone. Second, GGGPS belongs to a class of prenyltransferases that catalyzes the transfer of isoprenoid groups onto nonisoprenoid acceptors; this class includes protein prenyltransferases, DMAPP-tRNA transferase, DMAPP-AMP transferase, dimethylallyltryptophan synthase, and the recently characterized aromatic prenyltransferases (11Soderberg T. Chen A. Poulter C.D. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 14847-14854Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 14Kuzuyama T. Noel J.P. Richard S.B. Nature. 2005; 435: 983-987Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Finally, GGGPS is a homologue of PcrB, a protein of unknown function that is conserved in some Gram-positive bacteria, including the human pathogens Bacillus anthracis, Staphylococcus aureus, and Listeria monocytogenes (8Boucher Y. Kamekura M. Doolittle W.F. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 52: 515-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 12Nemoto N. Oshima T. Yamagishi A. J. Biochem.

Microbiol. 1998; 29: 261-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). To gain more insight into the unique stereochemistry of the unusual reaction catalyzed by GGGPS, and to shed light onto the function of PcrB, we have determined crystal structures of GGGPS from the sulfate-reducing hyperthermophile Archaeoglobus fulgidus in complex with G1P and citrate. The present work reveals 1) an ancient fold for this deeply rooted enzyme and 2) establishes, for the first time, a prenyltransferase function on a TIM-barrel scaffold. Our structures further unveil 3) how the “standard phosphate-binding motif” is utilized in concert with conserved active site residues to select for the G1P substrate, 4) a long apolar cavity that bears the hallmarks of a hydrocarbon ruler, and 5) a unique change to the classical (βα)8-TIM-barrel fold, which prompts us to present a hypothesis for the functional consequences of this adaptation. Cloning, Purification, and Crystallization—The coding sequence for AfGGGPS was amplified from genomic DNA (ATCC 49558D) and cloned into the NdeI and BamHI sites of the pET-15b expression vector. Native protein was expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3), grown in LB media at 37 °C, and induced at A600 ∼0.8 with 1 mm IPTG for 8-12 h. Selenomethionine (SeMet) protein was expressed similarly but in E. coli B834(DE3) and in M9 minimal media supplemented with 40 mg/liter SeMet. Cells were broken by sonication in Buffer A (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm imidazole, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol) supplemented with 16 μg/ml benzamidine, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Clarified lysate was passed over nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen), the resin was washed extensively with Buffer A, and proteins were eluted in Buffer A containing 500 mm imidazole. The His6-tag was removed by thrombin digestion (∼12 h) in the presence of 3 mm CaCl2. Proteins were passed over a Superdex 200 column (Amersham Biosciences) in Buffer A without imidazole, and peak fractions containing AfGGGPS were pooled. Proteins were further passed over a second nickel column, and the flow-through containing AfGGGPS was concentrated using a centrifugal filter device (Millipore, 10K MWCO). Finally, the buffer was exchanged to 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm Tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine hydrochloride by three rounds of concentration and dilution. This procedure typically yields ∼30 mg of AfGGGPS per liter of culture. AfGGGPS crystallizes readily in the R3/H3 space group. Crystals were grown at 22 °C by the hanging drop method, and microseeding was employed for consistent crystal quality. Equal volumes of protein (20-30 mg/ml) and seed solution (100 mm citrate, pH 6.0, 10 mm MgCl2, 16% polyethylene glycol 4000) were mixed over a reservoir solution of 100 mm citrate, pH 6.0, 10 mm MgCl2, 4-10% polyethylene glycol 4000. For G1P-AfGGGPS soaks, 5-10 mm rac-G1P (Sigma) was added to solutions during cryoprotection. In attempts to co-crystallize the enzyme with GGPP, the addition of 80 mm n-octyl-β-d-glucopyrano-side or 0.8 mm n-dodecyl-β-d-maltopyranoside to the protein solution was found to produce crystals in the P31 space group, in otherwise identical crystallization set-ups. Cryoprotection was achieved in mother liquor supplemented with glycerol, 2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol (MPD), or ethylene glycol and crystals were flash-frozen in a cold nitrogen stream. Data Collection and Structure Determination—Typically 180° of data were collected from randomly oriented crystals maintained at 100 K in a cold nitrogen stream. A three-wavelength multiple anomalous dispersion data set was collected at the National Synchrotron Light Source beamline X6A on a SeMet-substituted crystal. Native data sets were subsequently collected at the Advanced Photon Source BioCARS 14BM-D. All x-ray data were processed using the DENZO/SCALE-PACK software (16Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38252) Google Scholar) and reduced, when required, using the program TRUNCATE (17Collaborative Computational Project 4Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19667) Google Scholar). The AfGGGPS structure was initially determined using SOLVE (18Terwilliger T.C. Berendzen J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 849-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (3216) Google Scholar). After applying RESOLVE (19Terwilliger T.C. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol.

Biol. 1999; 6: 458-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (2561) Google Scholar) built the majority of the protein structure. All subsequent structures were solved by molecular replacement methods using CNS (21Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M.

Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16918) Google Scholar), and standard refinement protocols were implemented with CNS. Guided by composite omit maps, water and substrate molecules were added at late stages of refinement. The positions of all atoms were checked manually in the program O (22Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (12999) Google Scholar). The quality of the structural models was assessed by PROCHECK (23Laskowski R.A. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 231: 1049-1067Crossref PubMed Scopus (1071) Google Scholar). Although discussed in the main text, the AfGGGPS structure in the P31 space group has not been reported herein due to its relatively limited resolution (∼3.0 Å).

SPOCK: The Structural Properties Observation and Calculation Kit Program Manual. The Center for Macromolecular Design, Texas A&M University, College Station, TX1997Google Scholar). Prior to modeling (Fig. 3D), G1P, MPD, and two water molecules were removed from the G1P-soaked structure. A Mg2+-GGPP substrate was manually placed in the active site cleft. Annealing and energy minimization protocols were run in CNS (21Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J.

G1P was added back to the structure with its initial, i.e. experimentally determined coordinates. GGGPS Assay—To avoid the use of radioactivity (9Zhang D. Poulter C.D. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1993; 115: 1270-1277Crossref Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 10Chen A. Zhang D. Poulter C.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21701-21705Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Soderberg T. Chen A.

(Tokyo). 2003; 133: 651-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), we implemented an enzyme-coupled assay to detect the free pyrophosphate liberated by the GGGPS reaction. The PiPer pyrophosphate assay (Molecular Probes) was performed as described by the manufacturer in the “background management” setting. Absorbance was monitored at 565 nm, and all reactions were incubated at 37 °C in between time points. Different AfGGGPS concentrations were prepared in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, at fixed substrate concentrations: 25 μm rac-G1P, 25 μm GGPP (Sigma), and 1 mm MgCl2. The protein used as a negative control, orotidine 5′-monophosphate decarboxylase from M. thermoautotrophicum (MtODCase) (27Wu N. Mo Y. Gao J. Pai E.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 2017-2022Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar), was purified as described above for AfGGGPS. Overall Structure—Unless otherwise stated, we will be describing the G1P-soaked AfGGGPS crystal structure. The GGGPS enzymes can be divided into two groups based on phylogenetic analysis (8Boucher Y. Kamekura M. Doolittle W.F. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 52: 515-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 12Nemoto N. Oshima T. Yamagishi A. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2003; 133: 651-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The Group I GGGPS from A. fulgidus (AfGGGPS) presents a dimeric structure (Fig. 2, B and C). This is consistent with our results from gel filtration and the recent characterization of a Group II GGGPS from T. acidophilum (TaGGGPS) (12Nemoto N. Oshima T. Yamagishi A. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2003; 133: 651-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The structure of AfGGGPS in the P31 space group confirms its dimeric nature, 5J. Payandeh, unpublished data. as does the crystal structure of its PcrB homologue from B. subtilis (BsPcrB; Protein Data Bank code 1VIZ). Considering these results, it is not immediately obvious from sequence alignments (Fig. 2A) how the Group II GGGPS from M. thermoautotrophicum (MtGGGPS) would form its reported higher order oligomer (10Chen A. Zhang D. Poulter C.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21701-21705Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Soderberg T. Chen A. Poulter C.D. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 14847-14854Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). We conclude that AfGGGPS and most of its sequence homologues are dimeric proteins (Fig. 6A). The dimensions of an AfGGGPS dimer are ∼85 × 50 × 40 Å (Fig. 2, B and C). Each monomer buries ∼1,400 Å2, or ∼13%, of its total accessible surface area.FIGURE 6Activity of recombinant AfGGGPS. A,5 μg of AfGGGPS was run on a 15% gel for SDS-PAGE. AfGGGPS migrates at the expected molecular mass (∼26.4 kDa) when the sample is boiled (lane I) but remains mostly dimeric and migrates aberrantly (∼37 kDa) when unboiled (lane II). A molecular mass ladder is indicated. B, absorbance at 565 nm was monitored over time (minutes) in an enzyme-coupled assay to detect liberated pyrophosphate. Red, yellow, and green plots indicate AfGGGPS at final concentrations of 2, 0.2, and 0.02 μm respectively. The “activity” of MtODCase at 2 μm, a structurally related (42Holm L. Sander C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 316-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar) but functionally unrelated enzyme (27Wu N. Mo Y. Gao J. Pai E.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 2017-2022Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar), is plotted in pink for comparison.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Based on the unique three-dimensional structures of the cis-, trans-, protein, and aromatic prenyltransferase families (14Kuzuyama T. Noel J.P. Richard S.B. Nature. 2005; 435: 983-987Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar, 28Liang P.H. Ko T.P. Wang A.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 3339-3354Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar), it is surprising to see AfGGGPS exhibit a TIM-barrel fold (29Nagano N. Orengo C.A. Thornton J.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 321: 741-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar, 30Vega M.C. Lorentzen E. Linden A. Wilmanns M. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2003; 7: 694-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). AfGGGPS displays a central eight-stranded parallel β-barrel (β1-β8) with a tightly packed hydrophobic core, which is decorated on its periphery by α-helices (α1-α8). A striking feature of the AfGGGPS structure is that “Helix 3” has been replaced by a “strand.” Although it is without any regular secondary structure, we will refer to this structural element as α3* (Fig. 2B). To the best of our knowledge, the location of this type of modification has not been previously observed in any TIM-barrel protein. The residues preceding β1 form a “plug” (α0) at the bottom of the AfGGGPS barrel (Fig. 2B). Most archaeal homologues have an additional N-terminal extension of 10-20 residues, which tends to be enriched in basic and/or hydrophobic amino acids (Fig. 2A). In light of the AfGGGPS structure, we suggest that these N-terminal extensions may promote an association with the membrane by directly contacting membrane lipids or through an interaction with other proteins involved in lipid biosynthesis. Given the overall acidic nature of AfGGGPS (theoretical pI ∼5.0), it seems significant that the only appreciable clustering of basic residues on the electrostatic surface is also found within this region (Fig. 3A); this makes an interaction with the negatively charged phosphate groups of the membrane lipids plausible. The AfGGGPS active site lies at the C-terminal end of its β-barrel. This is evident from sequence conservation and the structures of AfGGGPS in complex with various ligands (Fig. 2, A-C). The presence of citrate ions dramatically increased the diffraction limit of the AfGGGPS crystals, and a molecule of citrate was subsequently identified within the active site. Coincidentally, soaking these crystals in G1P-containing solutions will replace citrate at this location. The two active sites within the AfGGGPS dimer do not behave in an equivalent fashion, irrespective of the space group or ligand(s) bound. For example, inspection of the electron density maps in the G1P-soaked structure clearly shows a molecule of G1P bound in one active site, with a “mixture” of G1P and citrate found in the other. The relative active site occupancy also correlates with the rigidity of different parts of the AfGGGPS TIM-barrel. As indicated by the average temperature factors (Fig. 2C and Table 1), a well bound substrate molecule induces stabilization within the region surrounding α3* (i.e. α2, α3*, α4a, and α4b), but it increases the mobility elsewhere (i.e. α8 and α1). Because these observations hold true in all of our structures, and since a similar trend in B-factors is found in BsPcrB, it seems unlikely that these effects are caused by crystal packing or lattice contact forces. Stereoselective Binding of G1P—G1P is found near the top inner rim of the β-barrel, running at a slight crossing angle against the C-terminal end of β7, surrounded by the neighboring regions of β6 and β8 (Fig. 3C and 4A). The interactions of G1P with AfGGGPS can most easily be divided into those formed by water molecules and the protein backbone or those involving direct side chain contacts (Fig. 4A). As suggested (12Nemoto N. Oshima T. Yamagishi A. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2003; 133: 651-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), the phosphate moiety of G1P binds to the TIM-barrel “standard phosphate-binding motif” (29Nagano N. Orengo C.A. Thornton J.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 321: 741-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar, 30Vega M.C. Lorentzen E. Linden A. Wilmanns M. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2003; 7: 694-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). It forms 10 hydrogen bonds in the AfGGGPS active site: 4 directly to the protein backbone, 1 to the Asn216 side chain, and 5 to four tightly bound water molecules (Fig. 4A). The hydroxyl substituent of the chiral carbon center that defines the stereochemistry of G1P forms hydrogen bonds with two conserved side chains: the hydroxyl of Tyr165 and the O∈2 of Glu167. The O∈2 of Glu167 also interacts with the amide of Ser169, while its O∈1 H-bonds to the C-3 hydroxyl of G1P (Fig. 4A). Therefore, the side chain of Glu167 is positioned in a way that allows it to hydrogen bond to the C-2 and C-3 hydroxyls of G1P at the same time. In the Group I GGGPS proteins, Tyr165 will also assist the side chain of Lys11 to interact with the C-3 hydroxyl of G1P (Fig. 4A). In total, G1P forms 14 hydrogen bonds within the AfGGGPS active site: 4 directly to the backbone, 5 through side chains, and 5 mediated by water. While the C-1 carbon and O1P oxygen of G1P are “recognized” indirectly in this binding mode, AfGGGPS conforms to the “four-location model” of stereospecificity to discriminate between the enantiomers G1P and G3P (31Mesecar A.D. Koshland Jr., D.E. Nature. 2000; 403: 614-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The same conclusion is reached in the context of the stereocenter recognition model for stereoselectivity (32Sundaresan V. Abrol R. Protein Sci. 2002; 11: 1330-1339Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), where binding of G1P is seen to involve two locations, one direction, and steric hindrance (i.e. a third “location”). With respect to the stereospecificity for G1P, it may be surprising that only two protein side chains are absolutely conserved between the GGGPS phylogenetic groups. Perhaps this is reconciled by the fact that Tyr165 and Glu167 simultaneously select for the stereochemistry that defines G1P (Fig. 4A). For completeness, we detail the substitutions that occur in MtGGGPS and TaGGGPS as they relate to the AfGGGPS active site. Ser169 and Asn216 are replaced by glycines, resulting in the loss of two hydrogen bonds to G1P (Fig. 4A). Additionally, Lys11 is changed to leucine, Glu64 to phenylalanine, and Glu122 to methionine (Fig. 2A); these substitutions will drastically alter the charge character of the active site in the Group II proteins. How these amino acid differences affect substrate binding, catalysis, and the release of product are issues that remain to be addressed. GGPP: Fit for a Groove—One prominent feature of the AfGGGPS structure is a deep cleft that runs across the top of its β-barrel. This starts within the G1P-binding site at the β7-β8 junction and transverses ∼20 Å across the barrel; it passes under α5′ and reaches Trp91 on α4a. The cleft becomes a tunnel as it moves underneath the side chain of Trp91, dives down and to the right ∼45°, then ends ∼10 Å later at Trp99. We believe this is the binding site for the geranylgeranyl moiety of GGPP for the following reasons (Fig. 3D). First, it is conserved and has a distinctly apolar character, with the length of the cavity being particularly void of water molecules. Second, it is continuous and leads directly to the C-3 hydroxyl of G1P. Third, it can accommodate a geranylgeranyl chain and it bears hallmarks of the “hydrocarbon rulers” found in other acyl- and prenyltransferases (28"
https://openalex.org/W2108414389,"ERMs are closely related proteins involved in cell migration, cell adhesion, maintenance of cell shape, and formation of microvilli through their ability to cross-link the plasma membrane with the actin cytoskeleton. ELMO proteins are also known to regulate actin cytoskeleton reorganization through activation of the small GTPbinding protein Rac via the ELMO-Dock180 complex. Here we showed that ERM proteins associate directly with ELMO1 as purified recombinant proteins in vitro and at endogenous levels in intact cells. We mapped ERM binding on ELMO1 to the N-terminal 280 amino acids, which overlaps with the region required for binding to the GTPase RhoG, but is distinct from the C-terminal Dock180 binding region. Consistent with this, ELMO1 could simultaneously bind both radixin and Dock180, although radixin did not alter Rac activation via the Dock180-ELMO complex. Most interestingly, radixin binding did not affect ELMO binding to active RhoG and a trimeric complex of active RhoG-ELMO-radixin could be detected. Moreover, the three proteins colocalized at the plasma membrane. Finally, in contrast to most other ERM-binding proteins, ELMO1 binding occurred independently of the state of radixin C-terminal phosphorylation, suggesting an ELMO1 interaction with both the active and inactive forms of ERM proteins and implying a possible role of ELMO in localizing or retaining ERM proteins in certain cellular sites. Together these data suggest that ELMO1-mediated cytoskeletal changes may be coordinated with ERM protein crosslinking activity during dynamic cellular functions. ERMs are closely related proteins involved in cell migration, cell adhesion, maintenance of cell shape, and formation of microvilli through their ability to cross-link the plasma membrane with the actin cytoskeleton. ELMO proteins are also known to regulate actin cytoskeleton reorganization through activation of the small GTPbinding protein Rac via the ELMO-Dock180 complex. Here we showed that ERM proteins associate directly with ELMO1 as purified recombinant proteins in vitro and at endogenous levels in intact cells. We mapped ERM binding on ELMO1 to the N-terminal 280 amino acids, which overlaps with the region required for binding to the GTPase RhoG, but is distinct from the C-terminal Dock180 binding region. Consistent with this, ELMO1 could simultaneously bind both radixin and Dock180, although radixin did not alter Rac activation via the Dock180-ELMO complex. Most interestingly, radixin binding did not affect ELMO binding to active RhoG and a trimeric complex of active RhoG-ELMO-radixin could be detected. Moreover, the three proteins colocalized at the plasma membrane.

Together these data suggest that ELMO1-mediated cytoskeletal changes may be coordinated with ERM protein crosslinking activity during dynamic cellular functions. In eukaryotic cells, rearrangements of the cortical actin cytoskeleton provide the molecular basis for changes in cell shape, motility, adhesion, and division. Organized signaling complexes at the cell membrane are thought to coordinate actin assembly with membrane association during these processes. However, the exact molecular nature of these signaling complexes is not well understood. The highly conserved ERM (ezrin/radixin/moesin) protein family has been implicated in embryonic development, formation of microvilli, cell motility, formation of membrane ruffles, and formation of cell-cell/cellmatrix adhesion sites through their ability to cross-link the actin cytoskeleton to the plasma membrane (for reviews see Refs. 1Bretscher A.

Each ERM protein contains an ∼300 residue FERM (band 4.1 and ERM) domain at its N terminus followed by an extended α-helical structure (∼160 amino acids) and a highly conserved C-terminal region (∼90 amino acids). An actin filament-binding domain site is located within the last 34 amino acids of this C-terminal region (4Pestonjamasp K. Amieva M.R. Strassel C.P. Nauseef W.M. Furthmayr H. Luna E.J. Mol. Biol.

The FERM domain promotes targeting to the plasma membrane via several transmembrane receptors and membrane-associated proteins.

In cultured cells, ERM proteins are predominantly coexpressed and enriched at sites just beneath the plasma membrane where actin filaments are densely associated (21Sato N. Funayama N. Nagafuchi A. Yonemura S. Tsukita S. J. Cell Sci. 1992; 103: 131-143PubMed Google Scholar, 22Franck Z. Gary R. Bretscher A. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 105: 219-231Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Biochemical and structural studies suggest that native full-length ERM proteins exist predominantly in a dormant state, by virtue of an intramolecular and/or intermolecular interaction between the N-terminal FERM domain and the C-terminal tail (23Magendantz M. Henry M.D. Lander A. Solomon F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25324-25327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 24Gary R. Bretscher A. Mol. Biol.

Cell. 2000; 101: 259-270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar). In this auto-inhibited conformation, the C-terminal F-actin-binding site and N-terminal protein interaction sites are masked. The dormant forms of ERM proteins have no reported binding partners except for the regulatory subunit of protein kinase A (27Dransfield D.T. Bradford A.J. Smith J. Martin M. Roy C. Mangeat P.H. Goldenring J.R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 35-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). Therefore, to allow N-terminal and C-terminal binding to the plasma membrane and F-actin, respectively, an activation mechanism that opens the molecular structure is required. Two types of distinct signals have been proposed to generate and/or maintain the active state of ERM proteins. The first involves the phosphorylation of a C-terminal threonine residue that is conserved in all three ERM proteins (T564 in radixin, T567 in ezrin, and T558 in moesin). Phosphorylated ERM proteins are concentrated in actin-rich membrane structures in a variety of cells and tissues, whereas total ERM proteins are distributed in both the cytoplasm and plasma membranes (28Hayashi K. Yonemura S. Matsui T. Tsukita S. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 1149-1158Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Oshiro N. Fukata Y. Kaibuchi K. J. Biol.

Phosphorylation of this threonine residue, or engineered phosphomimetic mutation of this residue (e.g. T564E radixin), reduces the affinity of the C-terminal tail for the FERM domain in all ERM proteins (31Huang L.

Conversely, nonphosphorylatable Thr → Ala mutants associate poorly with the actin cytoskeleton and act as dominant negative inhibitors of wild type ERM proteins (29Oshiro N. Fukata Y. Kaibuchi K. J.

The ability of ERM proteins to function in such a highly regulated fashion, and their association with certain signaling molecules, strongly suggests that ERM proteins might also help organize signaling complexes that serve to regulate cytoskeletal assembly. Members of the evolutionarily conserved family of ELMO (engulfment and cell motility) proteins have been shown to regulate actin cytoskeleton reorganization and formation of membrane protrusions through an interaction with the protein Dock180 (36Brugnera E. Haney L. Grimsley C. Lu M. Walk S.F. Tosello-Trampont A.C. Macara I.G. Madhani H. Fink G.R. Ravichandran K.S. Nat.

Nature. 2003; 424: 461-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). The Dock180-ELMO complex functions as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) specific for Rac, which mediates actin cytoskeletal reorganization and lamellipodia formation through several downstream effectors (39Bishop A.L. Hall A. Biochem. J. 2000; 348: 241-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (1682) Google Scholar). ELMO and Dock180 have also been found to localize to actinrich polarized membrane ruffles in cells (37Gumienny T.L. Brugnera E. Tosello-Trampont A.C. Kinchen J.M. Haney L.B. Nishiwaki K. Walk S.F. Nemergut M.E. Macara I.G. Francis R. Schedl T. Qin Y. Van Aelst L. Hengartner M.O. Ravichandran K.S.

One mode of targeting of ELMO to the membrane occurs via ELMO binding to the activated form of another small GTPase, RhoG. The simultaneous interaction of ELMO with active RhoG and Dock180 (via the N- and C-terminal regions of ELMO, respectively) serves as an evolutionarily conserved mechanism for RhoG-dependent Rac activation leading to cell migration and neuronal outgrowth (38Katoh H. Negishi M. Nature. 2003; 424: 461-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). Here we report that ELMO1 is a direct physiological binding partner for ERM proteins. An interaction of ELMO1 with radixin was observed both in vitro with recombinant proteins and at endogenous protein levels. Most interestingly, the interaction of ELMO1 with radixin appears to be distinct from other ERM-binding proteins, in that ELMO1 associated strongly with the closed, dormant form of the molecule as well as the open, active form of the molecule. Moreover, ELMO1 displayed only weak association with the isolated FERM domain of radixin, in contrast to other known ERM-binding proteins. Therefore, ELMO1 appears to be a novel ERM-binding protein, and the ELMO1-ERM interaction could have important implications for coordinated regulation of actin cytoskeleton reorganization during dynamic cellular functions.

Yeast Two-hybrid Screen—The mouse embryonic cDNA library was kindly provided by Dr. Ian Macara (University of Virginia). The cDNAs were cloned into the NotI site of the pVP16 vector. The yeast strain used in the two-hybrid screen was HF7C, with His, Trp, and Leu as selection markers. Yeast cells were transformed using the LiAc-based transformation protocol. Before the library screen, the full-length ELMO1 was tested on a -Trp, -His SCM plate, containing 5 mm 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole, and showed no transcriptional activation. When the ELMO1-Dock180 interaction was tested as a positive control, yeast cells transformed with pGBT10-ELMO1 and pVP16-Dock1-161 grew well on a -Trp, -Leu, -His SCM plate containing 10 mm 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole. The pGBT10-ELMO1-transformed yeast cells were then transformed with library plasmids and spread on -Trp, -Leu SCM plates, and ∼3 million colonies were screened. The yeasts grown out of the double dropout plates were replicated onto selection SCM plates (-Trp, -Leu, -His, containing 10 mm 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole). The yeast cells were allowed to grow into single colonies. After further restreaking on selective plates, the plasmid mixtures were then isolated from each clone after culture of the yeast in 10 ml of selective SCM medium. The library plasmids were rescued by transforming the individual plasmids mixture into KC8 Escherichia coli. Plasmids isolated from transformed KC8 were re-transformed into HF7C yeast cells with either the pGBT10-ELMO1 plasmid or the pGBT10 vector to confirm the specific interaction. Once this interaction was confirmed, the pVP16 library vectors derived from the two-hybrid screen were sequenced to identify the inserts. Transfection, Immunoprecipitations, and Immunoblotting—293T and HeLa cells were maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium containing 10% fetal calf serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin/glutamine.

In all experiments, carrier DNA was added to keep equal plasmid concentration between different samples. Lysis, immunoprecipitation, and immunoblotting were performed as described previously (36Brugnera E. Haney L. Grimsley C. Lu M. Walk S.F. Tosello-Trampont A.C. Macara I.G. Madhani H. Fink G.R.

Briefly, 293T cells were transiently transfected in 10-cm dishes with ELMO1 (3 μg), radixin (3 μg), Dock180 (10 μg), or other (3 μg) plasmids as indicated. For immunoprecipitation using the FLAG tag, 20 μl of anti-FLAG M2 antibody (Sigma) directly coupled to agarose was used per transfection condition. For ELMO1 immunoprecipitation, anti-ELMO1 antibody was incubated with protein A-Sepharose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 1 h followed by three washes with lysis buffer. For HA immunoprecipitation, 15 μl of anti-HA 12CA5 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) directly coupled to agarose was used per transfection condition. For GST precipitation, 20 μl of glutathione-Sepharose beads was used per condition. Cells were then harvested, lysed, and incubated with the beads for 1-2 h. Beads were then washed four times, and precipitation of proteins was assessed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. Purification of Recombinant Proteins from Bacteria—BL21 transformants were inoculated into 3 ml of LB medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin and incubated overnight at 37 °C. The culture was then diluted 1:100 into 250 ml of LB medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin and 2% (v/v) of ethanol and incubated for 1 h at 37°C. One mm of isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was then added, and the culture was incubated for 5 h. Bacteria were then collected by centrifugation, and the pellet was stored overnight at -80 °C. The pellet was then resuspended in 8 ml of lysis buffer (100 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mg/ml lysozyme, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 μg/ml pepstatin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin) for 20 min. The suspension was then sonicated three times for 15 s each on ice. Eight mg of sodium deoxycholate in lysis buffer was then added and incubated for 20 min at room temperature. Then 25 μl of 10 mg/ml DNase was added and incubated for 20 min at room temperature. Proteins were then collected by centrifugation and incubated with 300 μl of glutathione-Sepharose beads for 2 h at 4°C on Nutator. The beads were then washed eight times in washing buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 μg/ml pepstatin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin). The beads were then resuspended in an equal volume of washing buffer containing 20% (v/v) glycerol and stored at -80 °C. Proteins were quantitated by SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie staining. Cleavage of GST from ELMO1 and ERM Proteins—GST was cleaved from fusion proteins, where indicated, using a thrombin cleavage kit (Novagen). GST fusion proteins bound to glutathione-Sepharose beads were incubated with 1 μl of thrombin and 100 μl of cleavage buffer in a 1-ml total volume overnight at 4 °C on Nutator. Cleaved proteins were then collected by brief centrifugation and stored at -80 °C. The cleavage appeared virtually complete as determined by SDS-PAGE and staining with Coomassie Blue. Purification and Elution of FLAG-ELMO1 Proteins—293T cells were transfected in 10-cm dishes, one dish per condition of purified FLAG-ELMO1. Twenty four to 48 h later, cells were lysed, and FLAG-ELMO1 was immunoprecipitated and washed. FLAG-ELMO1 was then eluted using FLAG peptide (Sigma) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. In Vivo Rac GTP-loading Assay—Bacterially produced GST-CRIB proteins bound to glutathione-Sepharose beads were incubated with lysates from 293T cells transfected with the indicated plasmids for 1 h at 4 °C. The beads were then washed, and the levels of Rac-GTP present in the lysates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting for Rac (40Grimsley C.M. Kinchen J.M. Tosello-Trampont A.C. Brugnera E.

In Vitro GEF Assay—The radioactivity-based in vitro GEF assay was performed as described previously (36Brugnera E. Haney L. Grimsley C. Lu M. Walk S.F. Tosello-Trampont A.C. Macara I.G. Madhani H. Fink G.R. Ravichandran K.S. Nat.

Precipitated proteins were then eluted with FLAG peptide following the manufacturer’s instructions into 120 μl. The eluted proteins were quantitated via Western blotting. Levels of Dock180 were kept constant, and conditions were analyzed for Rac GEF activity as follows. 5 μg of bacterially expressed and purified Rac was loaded with 50 μCi of [α-32P]GTP (3000 Ci/mmol) in 40 mm MOPS, pH 7.1, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mg/ml BSA, and 0.3 mm unlabeled GTP for 20 min on ice. 10 mm MgCl2 was then added and incubated on ice for an additional 10 min. 250 ng of [32P]GTP-loaded Rac was added with 2 μl of eluted proteins (for wild type Dock180, volume for other samples was adjusted based on the concentration of eluted Dock180) in reaction buffer (25 mm MOPS, pH 7.1, 6.25 mm MgCl2, 0.6 mm NaH2PO4, 0.5 mg/ml BSA, 1.25 mm unlabeled GDP) in a final volume of 100 ml. After 15 min at 30 °C, 50 ml of the exchange reaction was subjected to nitrocellulose filter binding followed by scintillation counting. The presence of GEF activity was revealed by loss of radioactivity bound to Rac (due to the exchange reaction). [32P]GTP binding to Rac, in the control conditions with precipitates from untransfe"
https://openalex.org/W2052712746,"CRS2-associated factors 1 and 2 (CAF1 and CAF2) are closely related proteins that function in concert with chloroplast RNA splicing 2 (CRS2) to promote the splicing of specific sets of group II introns in maize chloroplasts. The CRS2-CAF complexes bind tightly to their cognate group II introns in vivo, with the CAF subunit determining the intron specificity of the complex. In this work we show that the CRS2-CAF complexes are stable in the absence of their intron targets and that CRS2 binds a 22 amino acid motif in the COOH-terminal region of CAF2 that is conserved in CAF1. Yeast two-hybrid assays and co-fractionation studies using recombinant proteins show that this motif is both necessary and sufficient to bind CRS2. The 22-amino acid motif is predicted to form an amphipathic helix whose hydrophobic surface is conserved between CAF1 and CAF2. We propose that this surface binds the hydrophobic patch on the surface of CRS2 previously shown to be necessary for the interaction between CRS2 and CAF2.

Group II introns are large, catalytic RNAs defined by a conserved structural organization consisting of six largely helical domains, characteristic interdomain interactions and several limited regions of conserved sequence (1Michel F. Umesono K. Ozeki H. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 82: 5-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar, 2Michel F. Ferat J.-L. Ann. Rev.

Trends Genet. 2001; 17: 322-331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). A few group II introns have been shown to self-splice in vitro; however, to do so typically requires non-physiological conditions. In vivo, proteins are required for efficient splicing, presumably to aid the folding of these large, intricately structured RNAs into their catalytically competent conformations (5Lambowitz A.M. Perlman P.S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1990; 15: 440-444Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar, 6Lambowitz A.M. Caprara M.G. Zimmerly S. Perlman P.S. Gesteland R.F. Cech T.R. Atkins J.F. The RNA World. Second Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1999: 451-485Google Scholar). Group II introns are found in bacteria, mitochondria, and chloroplasts, and, sporadically, in archaea (6Lambowitz A.M. Caprara M.G. Zimmerly S. Perlman P.S. Gesteland R.F. Cech T.R. Atkins J.F.

Microbiol. 2003; 5: 143-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The majority of bacterial group II introns are predicted to have the canonical group II intron fold and to encode a “maturase” protein that facilitates both splicing and intron mobility (7Dai L. Zimmerly S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 1091-1102Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 10Lambowitz A.M. Zimmerly S. Annu. Rev. Genet. 2004; 38: 1-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). In contrast, many organellar group II introns deviate in their primary sequence and predicted structure from canonical self-splicing group II introns, do not encode a maturase protein, and fail to exhibit self-splicing activity. In particular, none of the ∼40 group II introns found in the chloroplasts and mitochondria of higher plants have been observed to splice autonomously (11Barkan A. Chase C. Daniell H.

The loss of selfsplicing activity and maturase open reading frames from organellar introns was accompanied by the recruitment of host-encoded protein cofactors that are essential for splicing (5Lambowitz A.M.

Plant Cell. 1997; 9: 283-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). A yeast two-hybrid screen identified two related proteins that interact with CRS2: CRS2-associated factors 1 and 2 (CAF1 and CAF2) (12Ostheimer G.J. Williams-Carrier R. Belcher S. Osborne E. Gierke J. Barkan A. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 3919-3929Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Chloroplast splicing defects in caf1 and caf2 mutants showed that CRS2-dependent introns require the CAFs for splicing and that these introns can be subdivided according to their requirement for either CAF1 or CAF2 (12Ostheimer G.J. Williams-Carrier R. Belcher S. Osborne E. Gierke J. Barkan A. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 3919-3929Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar): the CRS2-CAF1 complex is required for the splicing of four introns, the CRS2-CAF2 complex is required for the splicing of three introns, and two introns require both CAF1 and CAF2. CRS2 is closely related to peptidyl-tRNA hydrolases (PTH) (15Jenkins B.D. Barkan A. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 872-879Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), whereas CAF1 and CAF2 belong to a family of proteins defined by the presence of a recently recognized RNA binding domain named the CRM domain (16Ostheimer G.J. Barkan A. Matthews B.W. Structure (Camb.). 2002; 10: 1593-1601Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The CRM domain family includes another chloroplast group II intron splicing factor, CRS1 (17Till B. Schmitz-Linneweber C. Williams-Carrier R. Barkan A. RNA (N. Y.). 2001; 7: 1227-1238Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), which has been shown to bind its cognate intron, the atpF intron, with high affinity and specificity in vivo (17Till B. Schmitz-Linneweber C. Williams-Carrier R. Barkan A. RNA (N. Y.). 2001; 7: 1227-1238Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) and in vitro (18Ostersetzer O. Cooke A.M. Watkins K.P. Barkan A. Plant Cell. 2005; 17: 241-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). CRM domains are also found as conserved, stand-alone open reading frames in prokaryotes, as typified by the Escherichia coli protein YhbY. Structural analysis of three eubacterial YhbY orthologs revealed structural similarity to known RNA binding domains and a putative RNA binding surface (16Ostheimer G.J. Barkan A. Matthews B.W. Structure (Camb.). 2002; 10: 1593-1601Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 19Willis M.A. Krajewski W. Chalamasetty V.R. Retty P. Howard A. Herzberg O. Proteins. 2002; 49: 423-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 20Liu D. Wyss D.F. J. Biomol. NMR. 2004; 29: 391-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). The CRM domains in CAF1, CAF2, and CRS1 are expected to adopt a structure similar to that of YhbY and to share a similar RNA binding surface (16Ostheimer G.J. Barkan A. Matthews B.W. Structure (Camb.). 2002; 10: 1593-1601Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). CAF1 and CAF2 each harbor two CRM domains and are therefore predicted to interact strongly with RNA, whereas recombinant CRS2 binds poorly and without specificity to its cognate group II intron RNAs in vitro. 5G. J. Ostheimer, K. Watkins, and A. Barkan, unpublished results. 5G. J. Ostheimer, K. Watkins, and A. Barkan, unpublished results. CRS2-CAF complexes are bound tightly to their genetically defined cognate group II introns in vivo, as shown by the ability of anti-CAF antibodies to selectively co-immunoprecipitate CRS2 and their target intron RNAs from chloroplast extract (12Ostheimer G.J. Williams-Carrier R. Belcher S. Osborne E. Gierke J. Barkan A. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 3919-3929Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Taken together these data suggest that the CRM domains in the CAF subunit of each CRS2-CAF complex bind intron RNA and recruit CRS2 to specific introns. The crystal structure of CRS2 and accompanying site-directed mutagenesis experiments identified a hydrophobic surface on CRS2 that is necessary for its interaction with CAF1 and CAF2 (21Ostheimer G.J. Hadjivassiliou H. Kloer D.P. Carrier-Williams R. Barkan A. Matthews B.W. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 354: 51-68Crossref Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In this work we sought to identify the site(s) in the CAFs that bind CRS2. The CAFs can be divided into three regions: an NH2-terminal region upstream of the first CRM domain, a central region consisting of the two CRM domains, and a COOH-terminal region downstream of the second CRM domain that shows little similarity between the two proteins (Fig. 1). We found that CRS2 binds to a 22 amino acid motif in the COOH-terminal region of CAF2 that is similar to a motif in the COOH-terminal region of CAF1. This 22-amino acid motif is predicted to form an amphipathic helix whose hydrophobic residues are very highly conserved among CAF1 and CAF2 proteins in both monocot and dicot plants. These results suggest a model in which the hydrophobic face of this amphipathic helix interacts with the hydrophobic surface of CRS2 previously shown to be required for its interaction with CAF1 and CAF2. Yeast Two-hybrid Assays—The yeast two-hybrid assay was performed as described previously (12Ostheimer G.J. Williams-Carrier R. Belcher S. Osborne E. Gierke J. Barkan A. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 3919-3929Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 21Ostheimer G.J. Hadjivassiliou H. Kloer D.P. Carrier-Williams R. Barkan A. Matthews B.W. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 354: 51-68Crossref Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The CRS2 open reading frame was amplified by PCR using the primers CRS2D and CRS2L (Table 1). The amplification product was cloned into the EcoRI and SalI sites of the pBD-Gal4 Cam plasmid, to generate the “bait” plasmid pBD-CRS2. The CAF2 “prey” plasmid, pAD-CAF2, has the nearly full-length CAF2 sequence fused to the Gal4 activation domain. It and pAD-CAF1(R312Start) and pAD-CAF2(S138Start) were identified in the yeast two-hybrid screen that discovered the CAFs (12Ostheimer G.J. Williams-Carrier R. Belcher S. Osborne E. Gierke J. Barkan A. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 3919-3929Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Truncated CAF2 variants were expressed by introducing stop codons into the CAF2 open reading frame using the Stratagene QuickChange mutagenesis kit. The stop codon substitutions were made using the following primer pairs: K354Stop with CAF2K354StopT-CAF2K354StopB, K452Stop with CAF2K452StopT-CAF2K452StopB, K486Stop with CAF2K486StopU-CAF2K486StopL, and K509Stop with CAF2N509StopU-CAF2N509StopL (Table 1). Plasmid pAD-cI, provided with the Strategene kit, encodes a fragment of the λ cI protein fused to the Gal4 activation domain. Yeast strains were generated by sequential transformation using the S.c.

Mustelin T. BioTechniques. 2001; 31: 1-4Crossref Scopus (59) Google Scholar). CRS2 was subcloned out of pBD-CRS2 and into the EcoRI and SalI sites of pEGST, thereby fusing glutathione S-transferase (GST) to residue 57 of CRS2. The caf2 gene was amplified using the primers CAF2P and CAF2L, which introduced a BamHI site immediately upstream of Gln59 and placed a HindIII site downstream of the native stop codon. The resulting PCR product, CAF2PQ, was cloned into the BamHI and HindIII sites of pET28a (Novagen). Sequences encoding the NH2-terminal region of mature CAF2, residues Gln59 through Arg226, were PCR amplified with primers CAF2P and CAF2NB and cloned into the BamHI and XhoI sites of pET28a. Sequences encoding the middle region of CAF2, amino acids Glu232 through Leu449, were PCR amplified with primers CAF2MU and CAF2I and cloned into the BamHI and XhoI sites of pET28a. Sequences encoding the COOH-terminal region of CAF2, amino acids Arg442 through the native stop codon, were PCR-amplified with primers CAF2CA and CAF2R and cloned into the BamHI and XhoI sites of pET28a. The vector-encoded histidine-T7 antigen tag was fused, in frame, to the NH2 terminus of CAF2, CAF2N, CAF2M, or CAF2C in these constructs. The CAF2 constructs were subcloned out of pET28(a) and into pAC28 using the XbaI and ClaI sites that flank the multiple cloning sites. E. coli strain BL21 (DE3) Star (Invitrogen) was co-transformed with pEGST-CRS2 and each of the CAF2 constructs pAC28-CAF2, pAC28-CAF2N, pAC28CAF2M, and pAC28-CAF2C. Co-expression cultures were grown in LB supplemented with 200 mg liter–1 ampicillin and 100 mg liter–1 kanamycin sulfate to an A600 of ∼1, induced by the addition of isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside to a concentration of 0.1 mm, and incubated overnight at 16 °C. Cells were harvested by centrifugation and frozen at –20 °C. Cell pellets were resuspended in ice cold lysis buffer (250 mm NaCl, 25 mm Tris 8.0, 10% glycerol), incubated with hen egg white lysozyme at 4 °C for a minimum of 2 h, and lysed by sonication. All subsequent steps were performed either on ice or at 4 °C. Cell lysates were by and cleared centrifugation the supernatant incubated with Ni2+ -NTA-agarose resin for a minimum of 1 h. The Ni2+ resin was washed three times with 10 column volumes of lysis buffer plus 20 mm imidazole and eluted with 10 column volumes of lysis buffer plus 200 mm imidazole. The Ni2+ resin eluate was incubated with glutathione-Sepharose 4B resin (Amersham Biosciences) for a minimum of 1 h, after which the resin was washed three times with 10 column volumes of lysis buffer and eluted with 2 column volumes of lysis buffer plus 20 mm reduced glutathione. Experimental results were evaluated by Western blot using antibodies raised against CRS2 (15Jenkins B.D. Barkan A. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 872-879Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), the T7 tag (Novagen), or CAF2 (12Ostheimer G.J. Williams-Carrier R. Belcher S. Osborne E. Gierke J. Barkan A. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 3919-3929Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Co-purification of CAF1 with CRS2—The CRS2 open reading frame starting at residue 44 (its predicted mature NH2 terminus) was cloned into the PTYB11 vector (New England Biolabs) such that a fusion protein is encoded with CRS2 at its COOH terminus and the chitin binding domain at its NH2 terminus. The CAF1 open reading frame starting at residue 54 (its predicted mature NH2 terminus) was cloned into the pAC28 vector (Novagen), such that a hexahistidine tag was fused to the NH2 terminus of the protein. For co-expression, E. coli strain BL21 (BD3) Star (Invitrogen) transformed with both plasmids was grown in LB medium supplemented with kanamycin (30 mm) and carbenicillin (50 mm) to an A600 of 0.8, induced by the addition of isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside to 0.5 mm, and grown overnight at 20 °C. Cells were harvested by centrifugation, and the cell pellets were stored at –20 °C until use. Cell pellets were resuspended in ice-cold Lysis Buffer (700 mm NaCl, 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0) supplemented with Complete-EDTA-free protease inhibitor tablets (Roche Diagnostics) and lysed by sonication. Cell lysate was cleared by centrifugation and cleared the lysate was incubated with Ni 2+ -NTA-agarose for 1 h at 4°C.The Ni2+ resin was washed three times with 10 volumes of lysis buffer, and proteins were eluted with lysis buffer supplemented with 250 mm imidazole. The eluted protein was incubated with chitin affinity matrix (New England Biolabs) for1hat4 °C.The chitin resin was washed three times with 10 volumes of lysis buffer, and CRS2 was released from the chitin binding domain by intein-mediated cleavage via incubating the beads with 50 mm dithiothreitol overnight at 20 °C. Released CRS2 was eluted with Lysis Buffer. The first 2 ml of the elution were applied to a Superdex 200 gel filtration column in Lysis Buffer lacking protease inhibitors and supplemented with 1% glycerol and 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol. The analogous expression system for CRS2 and CAF2 yielded a complex that behaved similarly to this CRS2/CAF1 complex (data not shown). CAF1 interaction was not tested with the GST-CRS2 fusion protein used here for CAF2. Co-purification of CRS2 with a NusA-22mer Fusion—Primers 22merUpper and 22merLower encode the peptide MFKLWKSAVDSS-LALLLDDAEA, which corresponds to residues 487 through 508 of CAF2. Primers for the 22mer synthetic gene were annealed and ligated into the SpeI and XhoI sites of pET43b (Novagen) to generate pET43–22mer. The wild-type crs2 gene was PCR amplified from a maize cDNA using the primers CRS2G and CRS2H, which introduce NcoI and EcoRI sites at the 5′ and 3′ ends of the desired coding sequence. The NcoI site was positioned such that the CRS2 protein started from a methionine substituted for Val57 such that the start of this protein coincides with the start of the homology to bacterial PTHs. The CRS2GH PCR product was cloned into the NcoI and EcoRI sites of pET28, and then shuttled into pAC28. E. coli strain BL21 (DE3) Star (Invitrogen) was co-transformed with pAC28-CRS2 and either pET43b or pET43–22mer. Co-expression cultures were grown, lysed, and subjected to nickel affinity chromatography as described above for coexpression of CAF2 domains with GST-CRS2. The presence of CRS2 in chromatographic fractions was assayed by staining and on immunoblots using antibodies raised against CRS2 (15Jenkins B.D. Barkan A. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 872-879Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Alternatively, material eluted from the Ni2+-NTA-agarose resin was applied to a Superdex 200 gel filtration column in 600 mm NaCl, 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1% glycerol, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 0.5 mm EDTA. Aliquots of column fractions were fractionated by SDS-PAGE and visualized by staining with Coomassie Blue. The CRS2-CAF Complexes Are Stable in the Absence of Their Intron Substrates—Previously we showed that CRS2 co-immunoprecipitates with both CAF1 and CAF2 from chloroplast extract and that the immunoprecipitates include cognate group II intron RNAs (12Ostheimer G.J. Williams-Carrier R. Belcher S. Osborne E. Gierke J. Barkan A. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 3919-3929Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). To determine whether the interaction between the CAFs and CRS2 is stable in the absence of intron RNA, CRS2 was assayed for its ability to form complexes with CAF1 and CAF2 when the proteins were co-expressed in E. coli. CAF2 was co-expressed with either a GST-CRS2 fusion protein or GST alone; cell extracts were applied to glutathione-Sepharose and eluted with reduced glutathione. CAF2 was retained by glutathioneSepharose when co-expressed with GST-CRS2 but not when co-expressed with GST alone (Fig. 2), indicating that the CRS2-CAF2 interaction is stable in the absence of intron RNA. To address the analogous question for CAF1, a CRS2 fusion protein with the chitin-binding domain at its NH2 terminus was co-expressed in E. coli with CAF1 fused to a hexahistidine tag. The bacterial lysate was subjected to nickel-affinity chromatography followed by chitin-affinity chromatography. After release of CRS2 from the chitin-binding domain by intein-mediated cleavage, the eluted material was applied to a gel filtration column. CRS2 and CAF1 co-eluted from the column at a position corresponding to globular proteins of ∼150 kDa (Fig. 3), whereas CRS2 expressed alone eluted with globular proteins of ∼22 kDa (data not shown), which corresponds to its monomeric molecular mass. These results show that the CRS2-CAF1 complex is stable in the absence of intron RNA. The sum of the molecular weights of mature CAF1 and CRS2 is ∼90 kDa; elution from the gel-filtration column with globular proteins of ∼150 kDa indicates that the CRS2-CAF1 complex is either non-globular and/or that it includes more than one molecule of CAF1 or CRS2. A 22-Amino Acid Segment of the CAF2 COOH-terminal Region Is Required for CRS2 Interaction in Yeast—The original yeast two-hybrid screen that revealed the interaction of CRS2 with CAF1 and CAF2 recovered CAF1 and CAF2 cDNAs that were truncated at their 5′ ends (Figs. 1 and 4A) (12Ostheimer G.J. Williams-Carrier R. Belcher S. Osborne E. Gierke J. Barkan A. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 3919-3929Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar); the CAF1 truncation is particularly extensive, removing nearly half of the protein. Assuming that CAF1 and CAF2 bind CRS2 in a similar manner, the recovery of this truncated CAF1 cDNA suggested that the CRS2 binding site is located in the carboxyl-terminal region of both CAF1 and CAF2. A yeast two-hybrid assay involving a series of CAF2 variants was used to define the region of CAF2 required for its interaction with CRS2. The CAF2 open reading frame was truncated by introducing stop codons immediately downstream of the first CRM domain (K354Stop), the second CRM domain (K452Stop) and in the carboxyl-terminal region (N509Stop) (Figs. 1 and 4A). CAF2(N509Stop) interacted with CRS2 but CAF2(K354Stop) and CAF2(K452Stop) did not (Fig. 4B). As such, the 57 amino acids between Lys452 and Asn508 are required for CAF2 to bind CRS2. The COOH-terminal regions of CAF1 and CAF2 show similarity only within two short segments: their COOH-terminal 16 residues and the segment encompassing CAF1 residues 556–589 and CAF2 residues 487–508 (Fig. 1). The latter motif maps within the 57-amino acid segment shown above to be required for CRS2 interaction, suggesting that it might be involved in binding CRS2. To test this possibility, CAF2 truncated at residue 486 was tested for interaction with CRS2 in the yeast two-hybrid assay. Whereas CAF2(N509Stop) did interact with CRS2 CAF2(K486Stop) did not (Fig. 4B). Therefore, CAF2 residues 487–508 are required for the interaction of CAF2 with CRS2. CAF2 Residues 487 through 508 Are Sufficient to Bind CRS2—To define regions within CAF2 that are sufficient to bind CRS2, the NH2-terminal region of CAF2, its central CRM domain-containing region, and its COOH-terminal region were assayed for their ability to copurify with a GST-CRS2 fusion protein after co-expression in E. coli and glutathione affinity chromatography (Fig. 5). The COOH-terminal region of CAF2 co-purified with GST-CRS2, whereas the central and NH2-terminal regions did not (Fig. 5B). Thus, the COOH-terminal region of CAF2 is both necessary and sufficient for binding CRS2. As discussed above, amino acids 487–508 in the COOH-terminal region of CAF2 are necessary to bind CRS2 in yeast, and they are conserved in CAF1. To determine whether these residues are sufficient to bind CRS2, a fusion protein was expressed consisting of NusA fused at its COOH terminus to CAF2 residues 487–508, followed by a vectorencoded COOH-terminal hexahistidine tag (NusA-22mer-6×His). Untagged CRS2 was co-expressed in E. coli with either NusA-6×His or NusA-22mer-6×His. The cell lysates were subjected to Ni2+ affinity chromatography. Upon elution with an imidazole gradient, the highly expressed NusA proteins eluted in a broad peak (Fig. 6A). When coexpressed with NusA-6×His, little CRS2 bound to the nickel column, and the elution of the small amount of retained CRS2 was diffuse and did not correlate with the NusA peak (Fig. 6A). In contrast, when coexpressed with NusA-22mer-6×His, more CRS2 bound to the nickel resin, and the elution profile of CRS2 was similar to that of NusA-22mer-6×His (Fig. 6A). These results suggested that CAF2 amino acids 487–508 are sufficient to bind CRS2. To further test this possibility, lysates from the same cells were fractionated by gel-filtration chromatography after elution from the Ni2+ resin. When CRS2 was co-expressed with NusA-6×His, insufficient CRS2 was retained on the nickel resin to observe after gel filtration (Fig. 6B). In contrast, when co-expressed with NusA-22mer-6×His, the elution profiles of CRS2 and NusA-22mer-6×His from the gel-filtration column were nearly identical and matched the elution profile for globular proteins of ∼80 kDa (Fig. 6B). CRS2 expressed alone elutes in fractions corresponding to its monomeric molecular mass of 22 kDa (data not shown). Taken together, these results provide strong evidence that the 22-amino acid motif from CAF2 is sufficient to bind CRS2. The 22-Amino Acid CRS2-binding Motif Is Predicted to Form an Amphipathic Helix with a Surface That Is Conserved in CAF1 and CAF2—Fig. 7A shows an alignment between the 22-amino acid CRS2-binding motif of CAF2 and the corresponding regions of CAF1 and of the predicted CAF1 and CAF2 orthologs in Arabidopsis and rice. Residues corresponding to CAF2 Leu490, Ala494, Ser497, Ala500, Leu501, and Leu503 are almost absolutely conserved among the maize, rice, and Arabidopsis CAF1 and CAF2 proteins, and those corresponding to CAF2 Met487, Phe488, Trp491, Val495, and Leu502 are conserved hydrophobic among all six proteins (Fig. 7A). When the CAF2 22-amino acid motif is modeled as an α helix, most of these conserved residues cluster on one face, where they contribute to a broad hydrophobic surface (Fig. 7B). It seems plausible that adjacent regions of this predicted hydrophobic surface mediate two interactions: (i) the absolutely conserved residues Leu490,Ala494, Ser497, and Leu501 cluster together and are excellent candidates for mediating the interaction with the hydrophobic CAF-binding surface identified previously on CRS2 (21Ostheimer G.J. Hadjivassiliou H. Kloer D.P. Carrier-Williams R. Barkan A. Matthews B.W. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 354: 51-68Crossref Scopus (31) Google Scholar); (ii) the conserved hydrophobic residues 488, 491, 495, and 502 cluster together and could interact with the hydrophobic core of the CAF protein itself. The remaining residues are mostly non-conserved and hydrophilic and would cluster on the opposite face of such a helix. It seems likely that these residues form a solvent-exposed surface of an amphipathic α helix in the CAF-CRS2 complexes. CRS2-CAF complexes are required for the splicing of 9 of the 17 maize chloroplast group II introns in vivo. The presence of predicted CRS2 and CAF orthologs in rice and Arabidopsis suggests that orthologous splicing complexes are a general feature of the chloroplasts of higher plants. The evolution of CRS2 from a bacterial PTH required that it gain the ability to bind to novel RNA substrates and to its CAF protein partners. Through a combination of structure determination and mutagenesis studies, the surface of CRS2 that binds the CAFs was identified previously (21Ostheimer G.J. Hadjivassiliou H. Kloer D.P. Carrier-Williams R. Barkan A. Matthews B.W. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 354: 51-68Crossref Scopus (31) Google Scholar). This surface is strikingly more hydrophobic and less polar than the corresponding surface of E. coli PTH. As the folding differences between CRS2 and PTH are minimal, it appears that CRS2 evolved its CAF recognition surface via the substitution of hydrophobic residues for surface exposed hydrophilic residues of its progenitor PTH. Because the same hydrophobic surface on CRS2 binds both CAF1 and CAF2 (21Ostheimer G.J. Hadjivassiliou H. Kloer D.P. Carrier-Williams R. Barkan A. Matthews B.W. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 354: 51-68Crossref Scopus (31) Google Scholar), it is reasonable to expect that CAF1 and CAF2 will share similar hydrophobic surfaces that dock with CRS2. In addition, since the CRS2 hydrophobic surface is conserved between maize and Arabidopsis (21Ostheimer G.J. Hadjivassiliou H. Kloer D.P. Carrier-Williams R. Barkan A. Matthews B.W. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 354: 51-68Crossref Scopus (31) Google Scholar), it follows that the CRS2 binding surface of the CAFs would likewise be conserved among plant species. In this work we have identified a predicted surface that is common to CAF1 and CAF2 and conserved between monocots and dicots, which could dock into the CAF-binding surface of CRS2. The CAFs belong to a protein family defined by the presence of CRM domains (12Ostheimer G.J. Williams-Carrier R. Belcher S. Osborne E. Gierke J. Barkan A. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 3919-3929Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). CRM domains have been proposed to bind RNA (12Ostheimer G.J. Williams-Carrier R. Belcher S. Osborne E. Gierke J. Barkan A. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 3919-3929Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 16Ostheimer G.J. Barkan A. Matthews B.W.

Y.). 2001; 7: 1227-1238Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) and, indeed, an isolated CRM domain binds RNA in vitro. 6O. Ostersetzer and A. Barkan, manuscript in preparation. Another member of this family is CRS1, which is required for the splicing of the group II intron in the chloroplast atpF gene (13Vogel J. Borner T. Hess W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 3866-3874Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 14Jenkins B.D. Kulhanek D.J. Barkan A. Plant Cell. 1997; 9: 283-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). A biochemical study has shown that CRS1 promotes the folding of its target intron through specific, high affinity interactions (18Ostersetzer O. Cooke A.M. Watkins K.P. Barkan A. Plant Cell. 2005; 17: 241-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). As the CRS2-CAF complexes bind their target introns with high affinity in vivo (12Ostheimer G.J. Williams-Carrier R. Belcher S. Osborne E. Gierke J. Barkan A. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 3919-3929Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), it is likely that the CRS2-CAF complexes likewise promote the folding of their target introns through specific, high affinity interactions mediated by the CRM domains in the CAF subunits. The presence in CRS2 of an extensive basic surface and a carboxyl terminus that is rich in basic and aromatic residues suggests that the function of CRS2 in splicing involves binding to its intron targets (21Ostheimer G.J. Hadjivassiliou H. Kloer D.P. Carrier-Williams R. Barkan A. Matthews B.W. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 354: 51-68Crossref Scopus (31) Google Scholar). However, isolated CRS2 does not bind with high affinity to intron RNA in vitro,5 leading us to propose that the CAFs recruit CRS2 to specific introns (12Ostheimer G.J. Williams-Carrier R. Belcher S. Osborne E. Gierke J. Barkan A. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 3919-3929Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). In this work we have provided evidence that the CAFs bind CRS2 via a highly conserved amphipathic α helix that is embedded in their generally non-conserved carboxyl-terminal segments. This lack of conservation suggests that the carboxyl-terminal regions of the CAFs serve merely to tether CRS2 to the CAF-intron complexes. Such tethering presumably increases the effective concentration of CRS2 and facilitates its binding to intron RNA. Whether CRS2 functions solely to drive the folding of the intron into its catalytically active conformation or plays some additional role remains to be determined. In addition to predicted CAF1 and CAF2 orthologs, the Arabidopsis and rice genomes encode two predicted CRM domain proteins that are similar to CAF1 and CAF2 but that are predicted to be targeted to mitochondria (Fig. 1). These proteins terminate immediately after their second CRM domain and therefore lack a region corresponding to the CRS2 binding site described here. In addition, Arabidopsis possesses an uncharacterized gene, At5g19830, that encodes a CRS2-like protein that is predicted to be targeted to mitochondria (21Ostheimer G.J. Hadjivassiliou H. Kloer D.P. Carrier-Williams R. Barkan A. Matthews B.W. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 354: 51-68Crossref Scopus (31) Google Scholar). This protein includes the basic aromatic carboxyl-terminal tail found in CRS2 but not in bacterial PTH (15Jenkins B.D. Barkan A. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 872-879Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar); however, the residues implicated in CAF binding are not conserved between CRS2 and At5g19830 (21Ostheimer G.J. Hadjivassiliou H. Kloer D.P. Carrier-Williams R. Barkan A. Matthews B.W. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 354: 51-68Crossref Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Therefore, the predicted mitochondrial CAF-like and CRS2-like proteins both lack regions corresponding to those responsible for CRS2-CAF complex formation in the chloroplast. It will be interesting to learn whether these CAF-like and CRS2-like proteins are required for the splicing of mitochondrial group II introns. If the mitochondrial CAF and CRS2 paralogs facilitate splicing without interacting directly, then the CRS2 paralogs can either bind to intron RNA independently or there is an alternative mechanism for their recruitment to intron RNA."

The human disease anhidrotic ectodermal dysplasia with immunodeficiency (EDA-ID) has been recently linked to mutations in NEMO. We investigated the effect of an alanine to glycine substitution found in the NEMO polypeptide of an EDA-ID patient. This pathogenic mutation is located within the minimal oligomerization domain of the protein, which is required for the IKK activation in response to diverse stimuli. The mutation does not dramatically change the native-like state of the trimer, but temperature-induced unfolding studied by circular dichroism showed that it leads to an important loss in the oligomer stability. Furthermore, fluorescence studies showed that the tyrosine located in the adjacent zinc finger domain, which is possibly required for NEMO ubiquitination, exhibits an alteration in its spectral properties. This is probably due to a conformational change of this domain, providing evidence for a close interaction between the oligomerization domain and the zinc finger. In addition, functional complementation assays using NEMO-deficient pre-B and T lymphocytes showed that the pathogenic mutation reduced TNF-α and LPS-induced NF-κB activation by altering the assembly of the IKK complex. Altogether, our findings provide understanding as to how a single point mutation in NEMO leads to the observed EDA-ID phenotype in relation to the NEMO-dependent mechanism of IKK activation.

The NF-κB family of eucaryotic transcription factors plays a crucial role in immune and inflammatory responses, development, and control of apoptosis (1Hayden M.S. Ghosh S. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 2195-2224Crossref PubMed Scopus (3371) Google Scholar). In addition, several genetic diseases have been recently linked to defects in the NF-κB pathway activation, and some of them are associated with mutations in the gene encoding the NF-κB essential modulator (NEMO/IKKγ) protein (see Ref. 2Courtois G. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2005; 62: 1682-1691Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar for a review). Amorphic mutations in NEMO cause incontinentia pigmenti, an X-linked dominant disorder with a variety of developmental abnormalities of the skin, teeth, hair, eyes, and central nervous system in heterozygous females and death in male fetuses (3Smahi A.

Male subjects with EDA-ID present EDA combined with life-threatening infections of multiple sites, including the digestive and respiratory tracts and the skin, the most common infectious agents being Gram-positive and -negative pyogenic bacteria as well as mycobacteria.

NEMO is part of the IKK (IκB kinase) complex, which also contains the protein kinases IKKα and IKKβ (10Zandi E. Rothwarf D.M. Delhase M. Hayakawa M. Karin M.

Although NEMO does not possess a catalytic function, it is indispensable for signaling through the canonical NF-κB pathway, since cells not expressing the protein are totally unresponsive to all tested stimuli (11Yamaoka S.

Trends Immunol. 2004; 25: 280-288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2079) Google Scholar). The kinases then phosphorylate the inhibitory IκB proteins, which keep NF-κB transcription factors inactive in the cytoplasm of resting cells. IκBs are in turn polyubiquitinated and degraded by the proteasome, allowing NF-κB to enter the nucleus and activate gene transcription. The activation mechanism of the IKK complex is still unclear. NEMO functions as a signaling adaptor between the upstream regulators and the kinases, and its oligomerization has been shown to be required for the activation of the complex (14Inohara N. Koseki T.

Many pathogenic NEMO mutations are found in the C-ter domain (2Courtois G. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2005; 62: 1682-1691Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Whereas some are located in the CC2-LZ subdomain and may interfere with NEMO oligomerization, many of them are found within the zinc finger motif. The integrity of this motif has been shown to be important for full IKK activation in response to several stimuli, including TNF-α, LPS, IL-1 (26Makris C. Roberts J.L. Karin M. Mol.

However, it was also reported that EDA-ID mutations in the ZF impaired CD40 signaling without affecting the NF-κB activation by TNF and LPS (7Jain A. Ma C.A. Liu S. Brown M. Cohen J. Strober W. Nat. Immunol. 2001; 2: 223-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar), indicating that the role of this motif remains to be precisely determined. In this paper, we studied the effects of an alanine to glycine substitution within the CC2 motif, which was identified in a patient with EDA-ID (5Doffinger R. Smahi A. Bessia C. Geissmann F.

We compared the biochemical properties of the purified C-ter fragments of NEMO, either wild-type (WT) or carrying the pathogenic mutation (A281G in murine NEMO). We show that this mutation destabilizes the association of the protein in trimer and induces a change in the conformation of the C-terminal zinc finger, indicating a communication between the zinc finger motif and the oligomerization domain. These subtle changes in biochemical properties correlate with a partial inhibition of the NF-κB pathway in response to several proinflammatory stimuli and with an alteration of the IKK complex assembly. These results allow us to discuss the mechanism of activation of the IKK complex by NEMO. Reagents—n-Dodecylmaltoside (DDM) and n-octyl glucoside (OG) were from Roche Applied Science. LPS from Escherichia coli was purchased from Fluka (Serotype 0111:B4), and human TNF-α was from Roche Applied Science. The absence of endotoxin contamination was checked in the RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen) and fetal calf serum (Biowest) used in cell culture. Construction, Expression, and Purification of Truncated Forms of NEMO—Truncated forms of murine NEMO corresponding to its C-terminal half (hereafter called C-ter; aa 241–412), or to two shortened C-terminal domains named ΔZF (aa 241–387) and CC2-LZ (aa 251–337) lacking the zinc finger motif, were cloned into pET-24a and pET-28b (Novagen), respectively, as described previously (27Agou F.

The A281G mutation was introduced into the pET-24a/WT C-ter and the pET-28b/WT ΔZF constructions by using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis method (Stratagene). The sequences of the primers used for PCR amplification are available upon request. All nucleotide sequences were verified by DNA sequencing. For the purification of the C-ter fragment bearing the wild-type sequence (WT C-ter) we started from 17 g of E. coli BL21(DE3)pLysS cells transformed with pET-24a/WT C-ter and grown at 30 °C in LB medium supplemented with 50 μg/ml kanamycin and 30 μg/ml chloramphenicol. At A600 = 1.5, 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (Euromedex) was added to the medium for 3 h. All subsequent steps were conducted at 4 °C. Cells were harvested by centrifugation and washed in 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, buffer containing 10 mm MgCl2 and 1 mm DTE. Cells were resuspended in Buffer A (50 mm MES, pH 6.0, 20 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTE, and 0.2 mm DDM) containing 5% glycerol and a protease inhibitor mixture (Complete, Roche Applied Science) and broken in a French press at 1,500 p.s.i. The lysate was then sonicated, diluted 2.5-fold in Buffer A, and centrifuged for 30 min at 12,000 × g. The supernatant was finally treated with 200 μg of RNase (DNase-free; Roche Applied Science) and 6,000 units of DNase I (RNase-free; Roche Applied Science) for 30 min at 37 °C before loading on a 42-ml Poros HS 20 column (2 × 12.8 cm; Applied Biosystems) preequilibrated in Buffer A. The bound material was eluted with a 400-ml linear gradient (20 mm to 1 m NaCl). Fractions containing WT C-ter were pooled according to optical density profile and SDS-PAGE analysis and dialyzed against 40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 20 mm NaCl, 0.2 mm DDM, and 1 mm DTE (Buffer B). Before applying the protein sample on a Resource S column (6 ml; GE Healthcare) equilibrated in Buffer A, the pH was carefully adjusted to 6.0 with 1 m MES, pH 6.0. Bound proteins were eluted with a 180-ml linear NaCl gradient (20 mm to 1 m), and fractions containing the WT C-ter protein were pooled and dialyzed against Buffer C (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm KCl, 0.2 mm DDM, and 1 mm DTE). The solution was further fractionated on a Resource Q column (6 ml; GE Healthcare) equilibrated in Buffer C. The flow-through fractions containing the pure WT C-ter protein were pooled, concentrated by ultrafiltration (Amicon Ultra-15; Millipore Corp.), and extensively dialyzed against Buffer C before freezing at –80 °C at a concentration of 1 mg/ml. The purification of the recombinant A281G C-ter protein was performed by using the same protocol, starting from a 4-liter culture of BL21-Gold (DE3) cells (Stratagene). The protein was frozen at a final concentration of 1.6 mg/ml. C-ter proteins were analyzed by MALDI-TOF MS on an ABI Voyager-DE™ STR mass spectrometer (AME Bioscience) after extensive dialysis in 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 10 mm KCl, 0.1 mm DTE, and 0.1 mm DDM. The His-tagged WT ΔZF and CC2-LZ proteins were purified as previously described (27Agou F. Ye F. Goffinont S. Courtois G. Yamaoka S. Israël A. Véron M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 17464-17475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). A281G ΔZF mutant protein was purified using the same protocol, yielding 18.2 mg of protein starting from 5.4 g of cells. All protein concentrations were determined either by the method of Bradford or by measuring A280 using extinction coefficients of 4,734, 3,555, and 2,368 m–1·cm–1 for the C-ter, ΔZF, and CC2-LZ proteins, respectively, calculated on the basis of their amino acid composition (33Gill S.C. von Hippel P.H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (5059) Google Scholar). Sedimentation Equilibrium Analysis—Sedimentation equilibrium experiments were carried out at 4 °C in a Beckman Optima XL-A analytical ultracentrifuge (Beckman Instruments, Palo Alto, CA) equipped with 12-mm path length double sector cells in an An60 Ti rotor. Sedimentation was performed at 9,000, 14,000, and 18,000 rpm with WT and A281G C-ter at initial concentrations of 15.7 and 12.3 μm, respectively, in 20 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, containing 100 mm KCl, 10 mm OG, and 1 mm DTE. Cells were filled with 150-μl samples, giving a column height of 0.3–0.4 cm. Optical density was measured at 240 nm with a radial increment of 0.001 cm. Samples were allowed to equilibrate for 30 h, and equilibrium was verified by superimposing scans recorded at 90-min intervals. When equilibrium was reached, data were collected, and centrifugation speed was finally increased to 55,000 rpm for 10 h to sediment the proteins. Radial scans were then collected in each cell to obtain a base-line correction. The partial specific volumes (v¯) of WT and mutant C-ter at 4 °C, calculated from their amino acid composition, were 0.724 ± 0.005 and 0.723 ± 0.005 ml/g, respectively (34Harding S.E. Rowe A.J. Horton J.C. Analytical Ultracentrifugation in Biochemistry and Polymer Science. The Royal Society of Chemistry, Cambridge, UK1992Google Scholar). The calculated density of the buffer at 4 °C was 1.007 g/ml (34Harding S.E. Rowe A.J. Horton J.C. Analytical Ultracentrifugation in Biochemistry and Polymer Science. The Royal Society of Chemistry, Cambridge, UK1992Google Scholar). Data were fitted with one-species, two-species, or multispecies models as described previously (27Agou F. Ye F. Goffinont S.

Modern Analytical Ultracentrifugation. Birkauser Boston, Cambridge, MA1994: 37-65Crossref Google Scholar). Gel Filtration Analysis—The apparent Stokes' radius of the C-ter proteins was determined at 4 °C using an AKTA Purifier 100 system equipped with a Superdex 75 HR 10/30 column (GE Healthcare). 500-μl samples at various protein concentrations (0.5 nm to 10 μm) were injected onto the column equilibrated in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 200 mm NaCl, 0.2 mm DDM, and 1 mm DTE (Buffer D) and developed at a constant flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. For each sample, the protein was diluted in Buffer D at the desired concentration and allowed to equilibrate at 4 °C. Depending on the loading concentration, sample elution was followed by measuring either the absorbance at 260 and 280 nm or the tyrosine fluorescence at 310 nm after excitation at 280 nm using a spectrofluorimeter RF-10AXL (Shimadzu) connected on-line to the AKTA system. Both detection methods yielded superimposable elution profiles. The elution of standard globular proteins and C-ter proteins is described in terms of Kav, which corresponds to the ratio (Ve–Vo)/(VT–Vo), where Ve is the elution volume of the protein and Vo and VT are the void and total volumes of the column determined by injection of blue dextran 2000 and 1,4-dithiothreitol, respectively. Bovine serum albumin (67 kDa, RS = 35.2 Å), ovalbumin (43 kDa, RS = 27.5 Å), chymotrypsinogen A (25 kDa, RS = 20.9 Å), ribonuclease A (13.7 kDa, RS = 16.4 Å), cytochrome c (12.4 kDa, RS = 17.1 Å), and aprotinin (6.5 kDa, RS = 12.5 Å) were used for calibration. Circular Dichroism Spectroscopy—Far-UV CD measurements were performed on an Aviv 215 spectropolarimeter (Aviv Instruments, Lakewood, NJ) with samples extensively dialyzed against 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 8.0, 10 mm NaF, 0.1 mm DTE. We avoided using DDM detergent to optimize the transparency of the buffer. C-ter protein concentrations were determined by amino acid analysis in a Hitachi L-8800 amino acid analyzer, after hydrolysis for 20 h in 6 n HCl, 0.2% phenol in the presence of a known amount of norleucine as internal standard. A bandwidth of 1 nm was used. For all recorded spectra, the product of the time constant and the rate of scanning was below 0.33 nm (36Hennessey J.P. Johnson W.C. Anal. Biochem. 1982; 125: 177-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Far-UV CD spectra were recorded at 20 °C with a 0.2-mm path length cylindrical quartz cell from 260 to 180 nm at 0.5-nm intervals, with WT and mutant C-ter proteins at the concentration of 12.2 and 15 μm, respectively. Each spectrum was the result of the average of three scans taken from the same sample minus the average of three scans from the reference buffer. Data were converted to differential extinction coefficient per residue, and secondary structure predictions were performed using the self-consistent method (37Sreerama N. Woody R.W. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 209: 32-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (946) Google Scholar) in the Dicroprot program 2000 (by G. Deleage, available on the World Wide Web at www.ibcp.fr/). In temperature-induced unfolding experiments, the spectropolarimeter was fitted with a Peltier temperature controller, and a 1-mm path length cell was used. Ellipticity was recorded at 222 nm as the temperature was increased from 1 to 95 °C at a rate of 1 °C/min. Temperature equilibration time and dead band were set to 0.1 min and 0.1 °C, respectively. An averaging time of 2 s was used, except for the lowest concentrations (2.1 and 3.2 μm for the WT and A281G C-ter, respectively), for which it was set to 10 s. In order to determine the melting temperatures, nonlinear least square fittings of melting curves were achieved using the following equation describing a two-state transition,S=Sn+nT+TcTmc+Tc((Su-Sn)+(u-n)T) where S represents the CD signal at 222 nm, n and u are the slopes of the native and unfolded base lines, Su and Sn are the specific signals of the native and unfolded protein extrapolated to the temperature of 1 °C, T is the temperature (in degrees centigrade), and Tm and c are the melting temperature and cooperativity, respectively. Multiple transitions can be modeled by a sum of independent single transitions and thus were fitted using a linear combination of the equation above, as described in Ref. 38Receveur V. Garcia P. Durand D. Vachette P. Desmadril M. Proteins. 2000; 38: 226-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar. At the concentrations of 12.2 and 15 μm for the WT and mutant C-ter, respectively, spectra were recorded at 10 °C intervals from 250 to 190 nm with 1-nm steps. The temperature was finally decreased to 25 °C at a rate of 1 °C/min, and a last spectrum was recorded. All spectra were deconvoluted as described above. Fluorescence Spectroscopy—Steady-state fluorescence measurements were carried out with a PTI QuantaMaster spectrofluorometer (PTI, Lawrenceville, NJ) equipped with a thermostated cuvette holder. All experiments were performed with a 1-cm path length quartz cuvette at 25 °C with bandwidths of excitation and emission monochromators set to 2 and 4 nm, respectively. Proteins were diluted to the desired concentration in 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 150 mm KCl, 0.2 mm DDM and 1 mm DTE (Buffer E) and allowed to equilibrate for 2 h at room temperature prior to analysis. In unfolding experiments, 6 m GdmCl (Sigma) alone or with 10 mm EDTA was added to Buffer E, and the pH was adjusted to 2.0 with concentrated HCl. Samples were then allowed to equilibrate overnight. All spectra were corrected for the buffer base line and normalized with protein concentrations. The fluorescence quantum yields determined by using N-acetyltryptophanamide (Sigma) were of 0.058, 0.063, 0.030, 0.034, and 0.025 for the WT and A281G C-ter, WT and A281G ΔZF, and CC2-LZ proteins, respectively. Flame Atomic Absorption Spectroscopy—Zinc titration was performed as previously described (39Ferri-Fioni M.L. Schmitt E. Soutourina J. Plateau P. Mechulam Y. Blanquet S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47285-47290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) with samples of the C-ter proteins extensively dialyzed against a buffer containing 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm DDM, and 1 mm DTE. Cell Lines and Transient Transfections—Human NEMO cDNA (NEMO) was inserted into a pcDNA3 vector as described previously (40Fusco F. Bardaro T. Fimiani G. Mercadante V. Miano M.G. Falco G. Israel A. Courtois G. D'Urso M. Ursini M.V. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2004; 13: 1763-1773Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The A288G mutation corresponding to A281G in murine NEMO was introduced by using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis method (Stratagene) with primer sequences available on request. The nucleotide sequence of A288G NEMO was verified by DNA sequencing. The 1.3E2 and 70Z/3 murine pre-B cell lines were maintained and transiently transfected as in a previous study (11Yamaoka S.

A recombinant N-terminal peptidase domain of ComA, designated PEP, was expressed as a soluble protein in Escherichia coli, purified to homogeneity, and characterized. Gel-filtration analysis revealed that PEP functions as a monomer. The purified PEP exhibited an efficient proteolytic activity for the substrate ComC, which was cleaved after the double glycine site.

A convenient method for analyzing the proteolytic activity of PEP was developed, and the kinetic parameters for ComC were determined (kcat = 1.5 ± 0.083 min–1 and Km = 62 ± 9.0 μm). Replacements of Cys17 of PEP with Ser or Ala and His96 with Ala resulted in complete loss of activity, indicating that both Cys17 and His96 are essential for the catalysis.

Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 269-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (2194) Google Scholar) is a way that bacteria communicate with each other to respond properly to growth conditions and successfully survive as a “community.” Bacterial cells are continuously releasing various chemical substances called autoinducers into their surrounding environment. As the population density of a bacterial species increases, so does the cognate autoinducer concentration, which subsequently reaches a threshold to bind to either the cell surface or intracellular receptors (2Fuqua C. Parsek M.R. Greenberg E.P. Annu. Rev. Genet. 2001; 35: 439-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (1117) Google Scholar, 3Miller M.B. Bassler B.L. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2001; 55: 165-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (3429) Google Scholar). The signal pathway then becomes activated, which leads to a cascade of intracellular biochemical signals or altered gene expressions in the target bacteria. Many bacteria are known to regulate diverse physiological processes through this system, such as bioluminescence (4Greenberg E.P. J. Clin. Invest. 2003; 112: 1288-1290Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), regulation of sporulation (5Lazazzera B.A. Curr. Opin.

The competence-stimulating peptide (CSP) 2The abbreviations used are: CSP, competence-stimulating peptide; ComC*, ComC with a His tag on the N terminus; DTT, dithiothreitol; FPLC, fast protein liquid chromatography; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; IPTG, isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside; MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight; PEP, peptidase domain of S. pneumoniae ComA. of Streptococcus pneumoniae is one of the well studied examples of autoinducers of Gram-positive bacteria. The 17-amino acid CSP is postulated to be cleaved from the 41-amino acid propeptide ComC and concomitantly exported by ComA with the help of an accessory protein, ComB (8Håvarstein L.S. Coomaraswamy G. Morrison D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11140-11144Crossref PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar). The accumulated CSP binds to the cell surface receptor ComD, which subsequently phosphorylates ComE by its histidine kinase activity and then induces the transcription of genes, such as comX and comW, associated with the DNA uptake (competence) and recombination (7Cvitkovitch D.G. Li Y.H. Ellen R.P. J. Clin. Invest. 2003; 112: 1626-1632Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 9Luo P. Li H. Morrison D.A. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 54: 172-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Thus, ComA is a key molecule essential for the first step of the quorum-sensing system of S. pneumoniae. ComA is a member of a family of bacteriocin-associated ATP-binding cassette transporters, which are composed of three domains (10Håvarstein L.S. Diep D.B. Nes I.F. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 16: 229-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar): an N-terminal domain that has been proposed to possess the peptidase activity, a transmembrane domain consisting of six membrane-spanning segments, and a C-terminal ATP-binding domain located on the cytoplasmic face of the membrane. The peptidase domains of this family are thought to cleave their cognate propeptides after the consensus Gly-Gly motif. Recently, the peptidase domains of the family members LagD, a transporter of lactococcin G in Lactococcus lactis, and CvaB, a transporter of colicin V in Escherichia coli, were confirmed to have proteolytic activity, for which a cysteine residue is critical. However, both peptidase domains were expressed mainly as inclusion bodies in E. coli, and their biochemical characterizations remain limited (10Håvarstein L.S. Diep D.B. Nes I.F. Mol.

We now describe the high yield expression and purification of the N-terminal peptidase domain (PEP) of ComA, which enabled us to do detailed enzymological and protein-chemical characterizations of PEP. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report describing the biochemical characterization of the signal-producing peptidase in the quorum-sensing pathway of Gram-positive bacteria. Cloning and Plasmid Constructions—S. pneumoniae (ATCC 49619) was cultured in heart infusion broth (BD Biosciences) overnight at 37 °C, and the genomic DNA was isolated using a Genomic DNA kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). The comA gene was amplified from the genomic DNA by PCR using the oligonucleotide primers 5′-GACTGTACGCATATGAAATTTGGGAAACGTCACTATCGTCCGCAAGT-3′ and 5′-ACTGTACGGTCGACCTAGCTATTGACCAAATGGGCGTAAAAGCCTCCCT-3′. The underlined sequences represent the NdeI and SalI restriction sites. The PCR product was digested with NdeI and SalI and ligated into pET-21b. Four independent clones were sequenced, and two silent mutations were found in all of the clones at Val55 (GTT to GTC) and Ala70 (GCG to GCA) in the peptidase domain of comA, compared with the sequence in the GenBank™ (M36180). The resultant plasmid was used as a template to amplify the C·His·pep3 fragment by PCR using the primers 5′-GACTGTACGCATATGAAATTTGGGAAACGTCACTATCGTCCGCAAGT-3′ and 5′-GACTGTACGGTCGACCTAGTGGTGGTGGTGGTGGTGTTGTTCCTTATGAGGCTTATAGTCT-3′. The underlined sequences represent the NdeI and SalI sites, and the italicized sequence encodes a His6 tag. After the amplification, the PCR product was digested with NdeI and SalI and ligated into pET-21b to generate the pSPP1. The comC gene was also amplified from the S. pneumoniae genomic DNA by PCR using the primers 5′-GACTGTACGCATATGCACCACCACCACCACCACAAAAACACAGTTAAATTGGAACAGTTTGTAGCTTT-3′ and 5′-ACTGTACGGTCGACTCATTACTTTTTTCTTTGTAAAATAAAATCACGGA-3′. The underlined sequences represent the NdeI and SalI sites, and the italicized sequence encodes a His6 tag. After the amplification, the PCR product was digested with NdeI and SalI and ligated into pET-21b to generate pSPC1. ComC* indicates ComC with a His tag on the N terminus. The sequences of the coding regions of the expression plasmids were verified using an Applied Biosystems DNA sequencer, model 377. Site-directed Mutagenesis—Site-directed mutagenesis was done using a QuikChange Site-Directed Mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions with pSPP1 as the template. The following primer pairs were used: 5′-GTGGATCAGATGGACG*C*CGGTGTAGCTTCATTA-3′ (asterisks indicate mismatches) and 5′-TAATGAAGCTACACCGG*C*GTCCATCTGATCCAC-3′ for the Cys17 to Ala mutation, 5′-GTGGATCAGATGGACTC*CGGTGTAGCTTCATTA-3′ and 5′-TAATGAAGCTACACCGG*AGTCCATCTGATCCAC-3′ for the Cys17 to Ser mutation, and 5′-GAAGGGAAATTGCTCG*C*CTACTATGTGGTGACT-3′ and 5′-AGTCACCACATAGTAGG*C*GAGCAATTTCCCTTC-3′ for the His96 to Ala mutation. Similarly, the mutant ComC*s were generated using pSPC1 as the template. The following primer pairs were used: 5′-CAAAAGATTAAAGGTGC*GGAGATGAGGTTGTCA-3′ and 5′-TGACAACCTCATCTCCG*CACCTTTAATCTTTTG-3′ for Gly at the P1 site to Ala mutation, and 5′-TTACAAAAGATTAAAGC*TGGGGAGATGAGGTTG-3′ and 5′-CAACCTCATCTCCCCAG*CTTTAATCTTTTGTAA-3′ for Gly at the P2 site to Ala mutation. The nucleotide sequences of the entire coding regions were verified after the mutagenesis procedures. Expression and Purification of PEPs—For expression of the wild-type and mutant PEPs, an E. coli strain, BL21 (DE3) pLysS, was used as the host. The E. coli cells carrying each expression plasmid were grown overnight at 37 °C in LB medium containing 50 μg/ml ampicillin and 20 μg/ml chloramphenicol. 5 μl of the overnight culture was used to inoculate 1 liter of LB medium containing 50 μg/ml ampicillin and 20 μg/ml chloramphenicol, and the cells were grown with shaking at 37 °C for 1.5 h. For induction, isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) was added to the culture to a final concentration of 0.2 mm, and the culture was then allowed to grow at 30 °C for an additional 5 h. After the 5-h induction, the cultured medium was chilled in an ice-water bath, and the cells were harvested and resuspended in 40 ml of a buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, 500 mm NaCl, and 5 mm imidazole, pH 7.9. The cell suspension was divided into two and stored at –80 °C. For protein purification, 20 ml of the cell suspension was thawed in a water bath and then briefly sonicated, and any insoluble material was removed by centrifuging twice at 12,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was loaded on a column packed with 3 ml of His·Bind Resin (Novagen, Madison, WI). After the column was washed extensively with the above buffer containing 100 mm imidazole, PEP was eluted with a buffer, 20 mm Tris-HCl, 500 mm NaCl, 100 mm EDTA, pH 7.9. The eluate from the His·Bind column was dialyzed against 20 mm Tris-HCl, 200 mm ammonium sulfate, and 2 mm dithiothreitol (DTT) at 4 °C and purified further using a Superose 12 10/300 GL column (GE Healthcare) connected to an ÄKTA fast protein liquid chromatography (FPLC) system (GE Healthcare) at the flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. The column was pre-equilibrated with a running buffer, 20 mm Tris-HCl and 200 mm ammonium sulfate, pH 7.0. All chromatography procedures were done at ambient temperature. Routinely, ∼10 mg of the purified protein was obtained from 500 ml of the bacterial culture for each of the wild-type and mutant PEPs. After DTT was added to a final concentration of 2 mm, the purified PEPs were preserved at 4 °C for characterization. Expression and Purification of ComCs—For expression of the wild-type and mutant ComC*s, an E. coli strain, JM109 (DE3) pLysS, was used. The E. coli cells carrying each expression plasmid were grown overnight at 37 °C in LB medium containing 50 μg/ml ampicillin and 20 μg/ml chloramphenicol. The overnight culture, 1.5 ml, was used to inoculate 300 ml of LB medium containing 50 μg/ml ampicillin and 20 μg/ml chloramphenicol, and the cells were grown with shaking at 37 °C for 3.5 h. For induction, IPTG was added to the culture to a final concentration of 0.2 mm, and the culture was continued at 37 °C for an additional 1 h. After the expression, the cultured medium was immediately chilled in a ice water bath, and the cells were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in 12 ml of a buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, 500 mm NaCl, and 5 mm imidazole, pH 7.9) containing one tablet of the Complete mini protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). The cell suspension was stored at –80 °C. For purification, 12 ml of the cell suspension was thawed in a water bath, and any insoluble material was removed by centrifuging at 15,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was applied on a column packed with 1 ml of His·Resin, and after the column was washed with a buffer, 20 mm Tris-HCl, 500 mm NaCl, 80 mm imidazole, pH 7.9, ComC* was eluted with the same buffer containing 300 mm imidazole. The buffer of the eluate from the His·Bind column was changed using a PD-10 column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, and then passed through a Mono Q HR 5/5 column (GE Healthcare) connected to an ÄKTA FPLC system at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min. The Mono Q column was pre-equilibrated and run with 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0. ComC* was recovered in the flow-through fraction. All chromatography procedures were done at ambient temperature. Routinely, ∼1.5 mg of purified protein was obtained from 300 ml of bacterial culture. The purified ComC*s were preserved at 4 °C for characterization. The concentrations of the purified proteins were determined spectrophotometrically using a molar absorption coefficient of ∈m = 17,400 m–1·cm–1 at 280 nm for PEP based on the number of tryptophan (5,800 m–1·cm–1) and tyrosine (1,450 m–1·cm–1) residues and ∈m = 760 m–1·cm–1 at 257 nm for ComC* based on the number of phenylalanine residues (190 m–1·cm–1) (12Kuramitsu S. Hiromi K. Hayashi H. Morino Y. Kagamiyama H. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 5469-5476Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Gel Filtration Analysis—Gel filtration chromatography was carried out using an ÄKTA FPLC system equipped with a Superose 12 10/300 GL column to determine the apparent molecular mass of PEP. A calibration curve was prepared using gel filtration calibration kits (GE Healthcare) containing ribonuclease A (13.7 kDa), chymotrypsinogen A (25.0 kDa), albumin (67.0 kDa), and catalase (232 kDa). The elution of these markers was monitored by the absorbance at 280 nm, and elution volume was measured from the start of the sample application to the apex of each elution peak. The logarithm of the molecular mass was plotted versus KAV that was calculated for each protein as follows,KAV=Ve-V0/Vt-V0 where Ve = elution volume for the protein, V0 = column void volume, and Vt = total bed volume. Circular Dichroism (CD) Measurements—The CD spectra of PEP were recorded using a Jasco spectropolarimeter, model J-720WI (Jasco, Tokyo, Japan) equipped with a thermocontroller using a 0.1-cm light path sample cell. The thermal denaturation profiles of PEP were measured by monitoring the CD at 222 nm in the temperature range from 15 to 75 °C with the rate of temperature change 1 °C/min. The buffer was 30 mm sodium phosphate, 20 or 150 mm ammonium sulfate, and 0.2 mm DTT, pH 7.0. For the pH stability experiments, PEP in 10 mm sodium phosphate, 200 mm ammonium sulfate, and 2 mm DTT, pH 7.0, was diluted with 9 volumes of the following buffer solutions: 30 mm sodium acetate (for pH 4.0 and 5.0), 30 mm sodium phosphate (for pH 5.8, 6.8, and 7.5), or 30 mm sodium borate (for pH 8.5, 9.0, and 9.2) containing 144 mm ammonium sulfate. The final pH values were determined after CD measurements using a Horiba pH meter, model F-8 (Horiba, Kyoto, Japan). The CD spectra were measured at 25 °C. Enzyme Assay—The PEP activity was assayed in a 100-μl reaction mixture containing 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, 150 mm ammonium sulfate, and various concentrations of the substrate. The reaction was started by adding the PEP solution to a final concentration of 0.25 μm. The reaction was carried out at 25 °C and quenched by freezing the mixture in liquid nitrogen. The reaction mixtures were thawed and loaded immediately onto a Waters μ Bondasphere C8 reversed-phase column (3.9 × 150 mm, 100 Å pore size, 5-μm particle diameter) (Waters, Milford, MA) connected to a Beckman System Gold high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) system (Beckman, Fullerton, CA), and the peptides were separated on a linear gradient from 10 to 55% (v/v) of acetonitrile containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid over 10 min at a flow rate of 1 ml/min at ambient temperature. The peptides were detected by monitoring the absorbance at 210 nm. For the semiquantitative analysis to study the effects of the salts, pH values, or inhibitors on the PEP activity, the reaction mixtures were loaded on 16% SDS-polyacrylamide slab gels. After the gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250, the amounts of the products were compared visually among the lanes. Overexpression and Purification—The N-terminal 150-amino acid domain of ComA, designated PEP (Fig. 1A), was expressed in E. coli, and the soluble fraction of the lysate was checked by SDS-PAGE. The amount of soluble PEP was increased significantly when expressed at 30 °C, compared with that when expressed at 37 °C (Fig. 1B). The soluble PEP significantly decreased at 25 °C (not shown), and thus the expression for the PEP purification was done at 30 °C. PEP was purified by a simple two-step procedure to apparent homogeneity as judged on a SDS-polyacrylamide gel. The N-terminal sequence of the purified PEP was determined as Met-Lys-Phe-Gly-Lys (performed by Nippi (Tokyo, Japan)), which corresponded to the predicted N-terminal sequence of PEP. Subunit Structure—The purified PEP was eluted by gel filtration as a single, symmetrical peak. The KAV value approximately corresponds to 23.8 kDa based on the standard curve with known proteins (Fig. 1C). Because the theoretical molecular mass of PEP is 17.9 kDa, this result suggests that PEP exists as a monomer. Structural Stability—Fig. 2A shows the CD spectra of PEP in the far-UV region from 190 to 300 nm measured at 15 °C and at 75 °C. The spectrum at 15 °C is typical of the folded, native state of a protein. At 75 °C, the spectrum showed drastic changes, and the solution became turbid, indicating that PEP was denatured. The denaturation was irreversible, and therefore, the following thermal-denaturation profiles are only semiquantitative and do not provide exact thermodynamic parameters. The CD value at 222 nm was monitored while the PEP solution was heated from 15 to 75 °C (Fig. 2B). The temperature scan in the presence of 20 mm ammonium sulfate showed a denaturation curve with an apparent Tm value of 42.5 °C. The Tm value increased to 47.9 °C in 150 mm ammonium sulfate. PEP is thought to be stable from 15 to 30 °C under both conditions. Fig. 2C shows the CD values at 222 nm for different pH values measured immediately and at 24 h (kept at 25 °C) after the pH changes. The zero time data show that PEP is stable in the pH region of 6.8–9.0. After 24 h, small differences in the CD values at 222 nm were observed at pH values from 6.8 to 9.0. This might be explained by a simple dilution effect caused by the protein adsorption on the wall of the sample tubes during the 24-h incubation because the overall configurations of the CD spectra from 190 to 300 nm were essentially the same as those at zero time (data not shown). On the other hand, the CD spectra deteriorated further outside this pH region after the 24-h incubation at 25 °C (data not shown). Thus PEP is stable at pH 6.8–9.0 and 25 °C for at least 24 h. Establishment of Assay System—To examine the enzymatic properties of PEP for the natural substrate, ComC* was prepared (Fig. 3A). Based on the thermostability and pH stability results of PEP described above, 150 mm ammonium sulfate was added to 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, and the reactions were done at 25 °C. To quantify the reaction products, the HPLC method described under “Experimental Procedures” was employed. Fig. 3B shows the elution pattern of ComC*. Minor peaks are contaminants of the purified ComC* and did not affect the following analysis. After a 2-h PEP reaction, ComC* was converted into two products (Fig. 3C). Peaks 2 and 3 were collected and subjected to MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry analysis (performed by Hokkaido System Science (Sapporo, Japan)). The molecular weight of peak 2 was 3,608, and that of peak 3 was 2,244, indicating that they are proteolyzed products derived from ComC* whose molecular weight was determined as 5,793 by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry analysis. The N-terminal sequence of peak 3 was determined as Glu-Met-Arg-Leu-Ser, which corresponds to the reported sequence of S. pneumoniae CSP (8Håvarstein L.S. Coomaraswamy G. Morrison D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11140-11144Crossref PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar). Thus, the cleavage site was identified as shown in Fig. 3A. The theoretical molecular weights of the two products are 3,567 and 2,244, which are close to the measured values for peaks 2 and 3, respectively. The molecular mass of peak 2 was 41 Da greater than the theoretical value. This might be because a small molecule such as some salt ion is attached. Kinetic Parameters for ComC*—The enzymatic activity was evaluated by the rate of formation of the products. Because the decrease in the area of the substrate (peak 1) was always equal to the sum of the increases in the area of the products (peaks 2 and 3), the amounts of the products were determined from a standard curve of ComC* based on the peak area of known amounts of ComC*. Basically, the same results were obtained from both products, and Fig. 4 shows the results from peak 2. The product versus time (Fig. 4, inset) and rate versus enzyme concentration (not shown) plots showed good linearities. The v/[E] versus substrate concentration plot conformed well to the standard Michaelis-Menten mechanism, yielding the kcat and Km values of 1.5 ± 0.083 min–1 and 62 ± 9.0 μm, respectively. PEP Mutants—To confirm the protease type of PEP, Cys17 was replaced with Ser or Ala, and His96 was replaced with Ala. Cys17 is the only cysteine residue of PEP, and His96 is proposed to make a hydrogen bond with Cys17 (discussed below). None of these mutants showed proteolytic activity («0.1% of the wild-type enzyme), indicating that Cys17 and His96 are essential residues for the catalysis, and PEP was confirmed as a cysteine protease. Effects of Protease Inhibitors—The PEP peptidase activity was not sensitive to known protease inhibitors not only for the aspartate, metallo, or amino peptidases (pepstatin at 150 μm, Pefabloc SC at 4 mm, chymostatin at 3.3 mm, aprotinin at 15 μm, EDTA at 5 mm, phosphoramidon at 3 mm, and bestatin at 1.3 mm), but also those for the serine/cysteine proteases, (antipain at 1 mm and leupeptin at 1 mm) and cysteine proteases, (E-64 at 5 mm). Activity for Mutant ComC*s—The double glycine sequence was mutated to investigate the substrate recognition of PEP. Each of the two glycines was replaced with alanine, and the activities of PEP for them were compared with that for the wild-type ComC*. The kcat/Km values for Gly1Ala (-Gly-Ala-) and Gly2Ala (-Ala-Gly-) decreased to 0.12% and 0.22% of that for ComC* (-Gly-Gly-), respectively (Table 1).TABLE 1Activities of PEP for wild-type and mutant ComC*sComC*skcatKmkcat/Kmmin-1μmm-1·s-1ComC*1.5 ± 0.08362 ± 9.0400Gly1AlaaGly1Ala and Gly2Ala are mutant ComC*s, where the glycine residue at the P1 or P2 site was replaced with alanine, respectively.-bReactions did not show saturation kinetics at the examined substration concentrations.-bReactions did not show saturation kinetics at the examined substration concentrations.0.48 ± 0.053Gly2AlaaGly1Ala and Gly2Ala are mutant ComC*s, where the glycine residue at the P1 or P2 site was replaced with alanine, respectively.-bReactions did not show saturation kinetics at the examined substration concentrations.-bReactions did not show saturation kinetics at the examined substration concentrations.0.89 ± 0.090a Gly1Ala and Gly2Ala are mutant ComC*s, where the glycine residue at the P1 or P2 site was replaced with alanine, respectively.b Reactions did not show saturation kinetics at the examined substration concentrations. Open table in a new tab ComA is a membrane protein, and as expected, we could not express the full-length protein in E. coli (not shown). The N-terminal putative peptidase domain of ComA (PEP) could, however, be expressed as a soluble protein. Early in the course of the purification, PEP was found to be precipitated during dialysis against buffers with low salt concentrations. Also, the activity could not be detected at 37 °C under low salt conditions. Among the various tested salts, ammonium sulfate showed a significant positive influence on the PEP activity. Therefore, ammonium sulfate was added to the buffers throughout the dialysis and gel filtration steps and for the PEP assay. The expression level of PEP was improved significantly at 30 °C. All of these findings can be explained by the CD measurement results: PEP is quickly denatured at 37 °C under low salt conditions, and ammonium sulfate stabilizes PEP. The activity of the peptidase domain of LagD was increased by sodium sulfate (10Håvarstein L.S. Diep D.B. Nes I.F. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 16: 229-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar), and it also improved the PEP activity detected by the semiquantitative SDS-PAGE assay. Because sodium sulfate was found to interfere with the HPLC assay, ammonium sulfate was employed in the present study. Although the activity of the peptidase domain of CvaB was enhanced by Ca2+ (11Wu K.H. Tai P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 901-909Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), the PEP activity was not influenced by Ca2+. The PEP activity was not affected either by NaCl, KCl, MgCl2, or Mg2+-ATP. The PEP activity was also examined in Tris-HCl or potassium phosphate buffers in the pH region 6.0–8.8, and the highest activity was observed in 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.0. Peptidases are usually assayed using amino acids or peptides conjugated with chromophores such as p-nitroaniline, β-naphthylamide, and 4-methylcoumaryl-7-amide (13Gabrilovac J. Cupic B. Breljak D. Zekusic M. Boranic M. Immunol. Lett. 2004; 91: 39-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 14Umetsu H. Arai M. Ota T. Abe K. Uchizawa H. Sasaki K. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 2004; 68: 945-947Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). To establish an experimental system to elucidate the recognition mechanism of PEP for natural substrates, His-tagged ComC* was prepared, and the HPLC assay system was developed to detect and quantify ComC* and the proteolyzed products. The present results clearly show that ComA indeed possesses an efficient peptidase activity in its N-terminal domain, cleaving ComC at the double glycine site to generate CSP. PEP exhibited kcat and Km values of 1.5 min–1 and 62 μm for ComC*, respectively. Although these parameters might be influenced by other parts of the ComA protein including the ATP-binding domain, they would be in a reasonable range to produce a quorum-sensing signal, which is effective in nanomolar concentrations (8Håvarstein L.S. Coomaraswamy G. Morrison D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11140-11144Crossref PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar). In this study, PEP has been experimentally demonstrated to be a cysteine protease. In the MEROPS data base (merops.sanger.ac.uk/), ComA of S. pneumoniae has been classified in the same clan as the papain-like cysteine proteases (15Rawlings N.D. Barrett A.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 325-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). The active site catalytic traid Cys17, His96, and Asp112 and the oxyanion hole Gln11 of PEP are completely conserved in a sequence alignment with other papain-like cysteine proteases (Fig. 5). In the cysteine proteases, the Cys and His residues are thought to be the catalytic residues that act as a proton donor and its acceptor, respectively. Besides the Cys and His residues, two residues are also important for catalysis in the papain-like proteases. These are a Gln residue that helps in the formation of the oxyanion hole, an electrophilic center that stabilizes the tetrahedral intermediate, and an Asp or Asn residue that is thought to orient the imidazole ring of the catalytic His, creating the catalytic triad (16Barrett A.J. Rawlings N.D. Woessner J.F. Handbook of Proteolytic Enzymes.2nd Ed. Elsevier, London2004Google Scholar). The Cys17 and His96 mutants of PEP showed a complete loss of activity, which supports the idea that Cys17 and His96 are the essential amino acid residues for the proteolytic activity. The substrate specificity of PEP was found to be very strict because even a minimum change (Gly to Ala) at the P1 or P2 subsite of ComC* was not tolerated by PEP. Unlike protein-degrading proteases, the strict substrate specificity of PEP would be a prerequisite for the signal-producing activity of ComA. Consistent with this, the PEP activity was not sensitive to typical peptide-mimetic serine/cysteine or cysteine protease inhibitors, such as antipain, leupeptin, and E-64, which inhibit papain or cathepsin B (17Zoller H. Handbook of Enzyme Inhibitors.2nd Ed. VCH, Weinheim1993Google Scholar). There are several papain-like proteases that specifically recognize a glycine residue in their substrates. To date, some of their three-dimensional structures have been elucidated: for example, ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase, which cleaves polyubiquitin after the Gly-Gly motif, and glycyl endopeptidase, which digests substrate proteins after Gly. In these proteases, residues with bulky side chains occupy the corresponding subsite(s) and make a tight space to fit glycine(s) of the substrate (Fig. 5) (18Johnston S.C. Riddle S.M. Cohen R.E. Hill C.P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3877-3887Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar, 19O'Hara B.P. Hemmings A.M. Buttle D.J. Pearl L.H. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13190-13195Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). On the contrary, the S1 or S2 subsite of papain or other family members is a wide, unrestricted pocket that accommodates a relatively wide variety of substrates (20Guarne A. Tormo J. Kirchweger R. Pfistermueller D. Fita I. Skern T. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7469-7479Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). From the sequence comparison, rather bulky side chains of Met15 and Tyr99 in PEP are predicted to construct the S1 and S2 subsites, respectively, where Gly and Ala residues are present in papain, staphopain A, and cathepsin B. This might confer PEP with its strict requirement of glycines at both the P1 and P2 sites of the substrate, ComC. In CvaB, which also recognizes the double glycine site, Ala is predicted to occupy the S1 subsite from the sequence alignment. This might explain why CvaB showed proteolytic activity for l-arginine-p-nitroanilide and partial susceptibility to antipain (11Wu K.H. Tai P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 901-909Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In the future, the crystallographic analysis of PEP will provide a clear answer regarding its unique substrate specificity. The present results would not only open new possibilities to study the quorum-sensing system of S. pneumoniae, but also provide an ideal model to study the peptidase domains of bacteriocin-associated ATP-binding cassette transporters.

https://openalex.org/W2126548430,"Virus-induced expression of interferon (IFN)-A genes is regulated by two members of the IFN regulatory factor (IRF) family, IRF-3 and IRF-7, which are activated by phosphorylation during viral infection by the IKK-related serine/threonine kinases TBK1 and IκB kinase ∈ (IKK∈). In this study, we demonstrate that three IRF-binding sites located in the virus-responsive element mediate the transcriptional activation of the IFN-A4 promoter by IRF-3. The precise arrangement of these IRF elements is required for synergistic activation of the IFN-A4 promoter following Newcastle disease virus infection or activation by TBK1 or IKK∈. The ordered assembly of IRF-3 multimers on the promoter also determines cooperative recruitment of IRF-3 and CREB-binding protein and differential virus-induced expression of IFN-A4 gene promoter compared with IFN-A11. Naturally occurring nucleotide substitutions disrupt two of the IRF elements in the IFN-A11 gene promoter, leading to a dramatic decrease in IRF-3 and CREB-binding protein recruitment and in IRF-3-dependent transcription. Transcription of the IFN-A4 promoter by IRF-7 is mediated by two IRF elements; promoter mutants that carry a reversed IRF element retain the ability to respond to IKK∈ or TBK1 expression in the presence of IRF-7 but lose the capacity to respond to virus or kinase-induced IRF-3. Interestingly, IKK∈ or TBK1 stimulates the IRF-7-mediated transcription of IFN-A11, although at a lesser extent compared with IFN-A4. Our data indicate that virus-induced expression of IFN-A genes is dictated by the organization of IRF elements within the IFN-A promoters and that the differential IFN-A gene expression, based on the IRF-3 responsiveness, is partially compensated in the presence of IRF-7 when both factors are activated by IKK∈ or TBK1.

The immediate cellular response to virus infection is characterized by the transcriptional activation of type I IFN 4The abbreviations used are: IFN, interferon; IRF, interferon regulatory factor; VRE, virus-responsive element; IKK∈, IκB kinase ∈; DBD, DNA-binding domain; NDV, Newcastle disease virus; CAT, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase; RT, relative transcription; CBP, CREB-binding protein; CREB, cAMP-response element-binding protein. 4The abbreviations used are: IFN, interferon; IRF, interferon regulatory factor; VRE, virus-responsive element; IKK∈, IκB kinase ∈; DBD, DNA-binding domain; NDV, Newcastle disease virus; CAT, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase; RT, relative transcription; CBP, CREB-binding protein; CREB, cAMP-response element-binding protein. genes involved in the host antiviral defense program (1Akira S. Takeda K. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2004; 4: 499-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (6623) Google Scholar). Multiple IFN-A gene family members are differentially expressed in cultured cells or embryonic fibroblasts infected by virus (2Hoss-Homfeld A. Zwarthoff E.C. Zawatzky R.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 4497-4502Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), and in vivo studies indicate that the virus species as well as the natural route of infection determines the magnitude of type I IFN production and the nature of the producer cell. For example, plasmacytoid dendritic cells are identified as the major IFNα/β-producing cells that rapidly express high levels of IFN-A during systemic infection and acute viremia, whereas local viral infections stimulate delayed and lower IFN-A expression, requiring a positive feedback amplification mechanism dependent on IFN-β production in cell types other than IFNα/β-producing cells (5Asselin-Paturel C.

These studies also indicated that differential IFN-A gene regulation is critical for the development, magnitude, and duration of innate and adaptive antiviral responses in the course of viral infection. Different members of the interferon regulatory factor (IRF) family participate in the IFN-A gene regulation, either positively or negatively, although virus-induced differential IFN-A gene expression is essentially mediated by IRF-3 and IRF-7 (9Reis L.F.L.

IRF-3 is constitutively expressed in all cell types, whereas the expression of IRF-7, constitutive in lymphoid cells and certain subsets of dendritic cells, is induced by IFN-α/β produced during viral infection in other cell types (19Lu R.

The ubiquitous constitutive expression of IRF-3 implies that this factor is required for the primary activation of IFN-A, IFN-B, and a subset of IFN-stimulated genes, yet generation of mice deficient for IRF-3 or IRF-7 indicated that IRF-7 functions even in the absence of IRF-3 and attributed a critical role for both factors in the activation of the initial phase of IFN-A/B gene induction (21Honda K.

Once the initial activation of genes is achieved, according to a multistep IFN-A/B gene expression model established for mouse embryonic fibroblasts, IRF-7 cooperates with IRF-3 to amplify IFN-A4 and IFN-B gene transcription and induce a set of delayed mouse IFN-A genes, including IFN-A2, -A5, -A6, and -A8 (18Yang H.

Among the different members of mouse IFN-A multigenic family, the IFN-A4 gene is the only immediate early gene expressed following virus infection in different cell lines and exhibits higher expression levels compared with other IFN-A genes (2Hoss-Homfeld A.

In this regulatory network, IRF-3 and IRF-7 are potent activators of virus-induced IFN-A gene transcription, although the mechanisms of their cooperative interaction with target sequences remain to be elucidated. IRF-3 phosphorylation is initiated by binding of double-stranded RNA, a product of viral replication considered as an early inducer of type I IFN synthesis, on membrane-associated Toll-like receptor-3 that leads to the recruitment of the specific TIR domain-containing adaptor TRIF and the activation of two serine/threonine kinases, TBK1 (TANK-binding kinase) and IKK∈, that phosphorylate IRF-3 (26Sharma S. tenOever B.R.

Coyle A.J. Liao S.M. Maniatis T. Nat. Immunol. 2003; 4: 491-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (2050) Google Scholar). IRF-3 activation also occurs upon recognition of double-stranded RNA by RIG-I, a retinoic acid-inducible RNA helicase involved in cytoplasmic immune surveillance (28Yoneyama M. Kikuchi M. Natsukawa T. Shinobu N. Imaizumi T. Miyagishi M. Taira K. Akira S. Fujita T. Nat. Immunol. 2004; 5: 730-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (3082) Google Scholar). TBK1 or IKK∈ is required for IRF-3 activation by RIG-I, the mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein MAVS functioning as an adaptor between RIG-I and both kinases (29Kato H. Sato S. Yoneyama M.

IRF-3 phosphorylation by TLR4, a receptor for LPS from Gram-negative bacteria, also requires the recruitment of TBK1 or IKK∈ via the adaptor proteins TRIF and TRAM (34Fitzgerald K.A. Rowe D.C.

Ligand binding on TLR-7 and -8 that deliver signals following their interaction with viral single-stranded RNA or TLR-9 that recognizes unmethylated CpG-containing DNA and senses infection by cytomegalovirus or herpes simplex virus type-1 leads directly to IRF-7 activation (35Hochrein H.

TLR7- and TLR-9-dependent pathways require the general TLR adaptor, MyD88 (myeloid differentiation factor) associating with TRAF6 and the serine-threonine kinase IRAK1 that induces IRF-7 phosphorylation (38Kawai T.

Whether IRF-7 mediates differential activation of IFN-A genes when TLR7 or TLR-9-dependent signaling is triggered in plasmacytoid dendritic cells infected by virus is unknown. TBK1 and IKK∈ are not involved in these signalings, and the relative transcriptional capacity of IRF-7 activated by IRAK1 or these kinases has to be determined. Studies with TBK1- and IKK∈-deficient mice have confirmed the critical role of TBK1 for IFN-A/B or IFN-stimulated gene expression in mouse embryonic fibroblasts following virus infection (41ten Oever B.R. Sharma S. Zou W. Sun Q. Grandvaux N. Julkunen I. Hemmi H. Yamamoto M. Akira S. Yeh W.C. Lin R. Hiscott J. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 10636-10649Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 42McWhirter S.M.

These studies have clearly demonstrated the involvement of TBK1 and IKK∈ in virus-induced type I IFN expression but did not determine the individual role of these kinases in IFN-A gene regulation. To determine the individual effects of IKK∈ and TBK1 on the differential expression of IFN-A genes and elucidate the mechanism of the cooperative transcription of IFN-A gene promoters by IRF-3 or IRF-7, the effect of each kinase on IRF3- or IRF7-mediated transcription of mouse IFN-A4 and IFN-A11 gene promoters was evaluated. We demonstrate that the precise arrangement of multiple IRF elements within the IFN-A4 gene promoter determines in vivo recruitment of IRF-3 and CBP in correlation with virus inducibility. This organization is also critical for the differential stimulation of IFN-A4 gene promoter activity by IKK∈ and TBK1. Our data indicate that naturally occurring nucleotide substitutions that alter the IRF-3 response of IRF elements on different IFN-A gene promoters dictate the differential expression of IFN-A genes. Cell Culture and Virus Infection—Human embryonic kidney 293 (ATCC CRL 1573), mouse L929 (ATCC CCL 1), and human HeLa S3 cells (ATCC CCL 2.2) were grown in α-minimal essential medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, glutamine, and antibiotics. Infection of L929 and HeLa cells with Newcastle disease virus (NDV; La Jolla strain) and HEK293T cells with Sendai virus were performed at a multiplicity of infection of 1–5. After a 1-h incubation in serum-free medium, cells were washed and placed in growth medium containing 5% fetal bovine serum for 7 h. Plasmids—Reporter plasmids pIF4T and pIF11T carrying the -470 to +19 fragment of the mouse IFN-A4 gene promoter and the -457 to +19 fragment of the mouse IFN-A11 gene promoter, respectively, and the pIF4J and pIF11J constructs containing the -120 to +19 fragment of both promoters, upstream of the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) or luciferase reporter gene have been previously described (45Bragança J.

Constructs carrying -78A/G (pIF4T-M78), -57G/C (pIF4T-M57), or both substitutions (pIF4T-M57/78) in the mouse IFN-A4 gene promoter were also described earlier (46Morin P. Bragança J. Bandu M.-T.

Promoters containing NN/TA substitutions in different GAAANN motifs were obtained by two-step PCR mutagenesis of the pIF4T plasmid. Similar two-step PCR mutagenesis of the pIF4J plasmid containing the -120 to +19 fragment of the mouse IFN-A4 promoter was used to obtain IFN-A4 promoters with reversed orientation of B or C module (pIF4J[Brev]-CAT and pIF4J[Crev]-CAT, respectively). The sequence of each construct was confirmed by DNA sequence analysis. Plasmids expressing human IRF-3, IRF-3(5D), IRF-7A, MAVS, RIG-I, ΔRIG-I, IKK∈, and TBK1 as well as the kinase-dead mutants of the kinases (K38A constructs) have been previously described (17Zhang L.

Transfections and Reporter Assays—Human HEK 293T cells were seeded at 7 × 104 cells in 12-well plates in minimal essential medium supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum. After 18–24 h, 0.5 μg of reporter plasmid and 62.5 ng of reference plasmid pIEF-LacZ in the presence of various amounts of IRF- or kinase-expressing plasmids (see the legends to Figs. 7 and 9) were transfected by the calcium phosphate method (48Gorman C.M. Moffat L.F. Howard B.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1982; 2: 1044-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (5292) Google Scholar). 48 h after transfection, cells were harvested to monitor the enzymatic activities. The CAT or luciferase values, normalized according to the β-galactosidase levels, were obtained in at least three independent transfection experiments, each performed in triplicate with two or three different clones. Transcription levels were expressed as relative transcription (RT) and inducibility values correspond to either the ratio between RT values obtained in overexpression conditions (with IRF- and/or kinase-expressing plasmids) to values obtained by cotransfection of the empty vector pcDNA3 or to the ratio between RT values obtained in virus-induced and in mock-induced conditions.FIGURE 9IKK∈ and TBK1 differentially affect IRF7-mediated activation of IFN-A4.

The DNA-protein complexes were resolved on a 7% polyacrylamide (30:1) gel in 25 mm TEB, pH 8.3. The bound DNA was quantitated using a Storm PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences). Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Assay—HeLa cells (5 × 106) were transfected with 10 μg of pIF4T, pIF4T-M57, pIF4T-M78, or pIF4T-M78/57 plasmids. 48 h after transfection, cells were infected with NDV for 6 h. HEK293T cells (2 × 106) were plated and transfected 24 h later with 7.5 μg of plasmids pIF4T, pIF11T, pIF4J[Brev], or pIF4J[Crev] together with 3 μg of pcDNA3-IKK∈ or pcDNA3-TBK1 in the absence or presence of 1.5 μg of pcDNA3-IRF-3. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays were performed according to the protocol described by Orlando et al. (49Orlando V. Strutt H. Paro R.

Protein-bound cross-linked chromatin was extracted from cells after sonication and purified by isopycnic centrifugation. 20 μg of chromatin were immunoprecipitated with 5 μg of polyclonal anti-IRF-3 (s-9082) or anti-CBP (sc-583 and sc-369) antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA). DNA, isolated from immunoprecipitated material after reversion of cross-link, was used as a template for PCR amplification with the primers sense (5′-ACAAGCAGAGAGTGAAG-3′), corresponding to the -119 to -103 fragment of the IFN-A4 or IFN-A11 gene promoter, and antisense (5′-CCCATATCACCAGCTCACCGTCTTTC-3′), annealing with the reporter CAT gene.

Island M.L. Genin P. Morin P. Navarro S. Biochimie (Paris). 2002; 84: 643-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Maximal virus-induced transcription of the mouse IFN-A4 gene requires the presence of the virus-responsive element, VRE-A4, delimited to the -120 to -40 region of IFN-A4 gene promoter (45Bragança J.

IRF-3 and IRF-7 are potent activators of virus-induced IFN-A gene transcription, although their mechanism of interaction with target IFN-A sequences remains to be elucidated. To define the specificity of IRF-3 and IRF-7 for the three IRF-elements (B, C, and D) located in the VRE-A4, mutated IFN-A4 promoters were generated by substituting these motifs with the GAAATA motif (Fig. 1), which was previously shown to be unresponsive to both IRF-3(5D) and IRF-7A ectopic expression (46Morin P. Bragança J. Bandu M.-T. Lin R. Hiscott J. Doly J. Civas A. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 316: 1009-1022Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The capacity of these mutated VRE-A4 constructs to respond to virus or to activation by IRF-3(5D) or IRF-7A was then examined (Table 1).TABLE 1Responses of NN/TA IFN-A4 promoter mutants to IRF3, IRF7A, and virus infection Specificity of IRF-3 and IRF-7 for the three IRF-elements of the IFN-A4 gene promoter is shown. Transfection experiments were performed in HEK293T cells with pIF4T or the NN/TA-mutated promoters in the presence of 200 ng of plasmid expressing either the constitutively active IRF-3(5D) or IRF-7A. RT values and -fold inhibition are indicated in comparison with IFN-A4 promoter construct pIF4T. The 2-fold inhibition observed in mutants MA, MB2, and MD1, comparable with the 1.4-fold decrease observed with Mct (control mutant containing a NN/TA substitution outside of an IRF element), indicated that the NN residues in the corresponding DNA motifs were not critical for IRF-3-mediated transcription.

Human PMN inactivate LTB4 by ω-oxidation catalyzed by cytochrome P-450 (CYP) 4F3A. The contribution of the enzymatic inactivation of LTB4 by CYP4Fs to down-regulating functional responses of cells to LTB4 is unknown. To elucidate the role of CYP4F-mediated inactivation of LTB4 in terminating the responses of PMN to LTB4 and to identify a target for future genetic studies in mice, we have identified the enzyme that catalyzes the ω-1 and ω-2 oxidation of LTB4 in mouse myeloid cells as CYP4F18. As determined by mass spectrometry, this enzyme catalyzes the conversion of LTB4 to 19-OH LTB4 and to a lesser extent 18-OH LTB4. Inhibition of CYP4F18 resulted in a marked increase in calcium flux and a 220% increase in the chemotactic response of mouse PMN to LTB4. CYP4F18 expression was induced in bone marrow-derived dendritic cells by bacterial lipopolysaccharide, a ligand for TLR4, and by poly(I·C), a ligand for TLR3. However, when bone marrow-derived myeloid dendritic cells trafficked to popliteal lymph nodes from paw pads, the expression of CYP4F18 was down-regulated. The results identify CYP4F18 as a critical protein in the regulation of LTB4 metabolism and functional responses in mouse PMN and identify it as the functional orthologue of human PMN CYP4F3A.

Understanding the molecular basis of LTB4 signal termination is critical to elucidating how animals control the amplitude of inflammation in LTB4-dependent settings. There are two general cellular mechanisms that have the potential to terminate the responsiveness to LTB4 and to all other chemoattractant molecules for G protein-coupled receptors. The first is the enzymatic metabolism of ligands. The second is receptor desensitization, which is based on G protein-coupled receptor kinases and β-arrestin (27Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol.

These products (and LTB4 itself) can be converted by a 12-hydroxydehydrogenase to their 11,12-dihydro products (35Powell W.S. Gravelle F. J. Biol.

Based on these considerations and with the ultimate goal of understanding the role of CYP4Fs in terminating responses to LTB4 in vivo, we sought to identify the enzyme responsible for the ω-1 and ω-2 oxidation of LTB4 in mouse PMN and other leukocytes and to identify a functional role for CYP4F family members in the regulation of PMN responses to LTB4. We identified CYP4F18 as the mouse LTB4 ω-1 and ω-2 hydroxylase in mouse PMN and macrophages. Inhibition of CYP4F18 by the irreversible inhibitor of fatty acid and eicosanoid ω-hydroxylases 17-ODYA resulted in a 220% increase in the chemotactic response of PMN to LTB4 and a marked increase in calcium flux in response to LTB4. Inhibition of human PMN CYP4F3A also resulted in clear augmentation of calcium flux in response to LTB4. In addition, CYP4F18 expression was induced in bone marrow-derived DC by bacterial lipopolysaccharide, a ligand for TLR4 and poly(I·C), a ligand for TLR3. However, when DC trafficked to popliteal lymph nodes, the pattern of CYP4F18 expression was down-regulated relative to CYP4F15. The results identify ω-1 and ω-2 oxidation by CYP4F18 as a step in controlling the inactivation of functional responses to LTB4 in mouse PMN. Isolation of Mouse Cells and Tissues—9–12-week-old male and female Balb/c mice were used for experimentation and were euthanized with CO2 in accordance with the guidelines of the Massachusetts General Hospital/Partners Committee on Research Animal Care. Selected tissues (liver, kidney, spleen, thymus, heart, lung, brain, ovary, and bladder) were dissected for RNA analysis immediately after euthanization. Axillary, inguinal, and popliteal lymph nodes were dissected and pooled for analysis. Peripheral blood samples were drawn from the tail veins of mice prior to euthanization. Isolation of Peritoneal PMN and Macrophages—To generate peritoneal PMN, mice were injected intraperitoneally with 1 ml of sterile 0.9% sodium caseinate. After 18 h the mice were euthanized, and 9 ml of sterile PBS was injected into the peritoneal cavity to harvest PMN by peritoneal lavage. To isolate peritoneal macrophages, mice were injected intraperitoneally with 1 ml of sterile 3% sodium thioglycollate, and macrophages were harvested 72 h after injection by peritoneal lavage. In Vitro Differentiation and in Vivo Injection of Mouse DC—Immature mouse DC were obtained by a modification of the method of Inaba et al. (42Inaba K. Inaba N. Romani M. Aya H. Deguchi M. Ikehara S.

Bone marrow cells were isolated by flushing the femurs and tibiae of mice with RPMI 1640 containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum. The cells were filtered through a spleen mesh, centrifuged at 1200 rpm for 5 min, and resuspended in ACK buffer (BioWhittaker) for 5 min to lyse red blood cells. The cells at this stage were used to analyze the expression of CYP4F18 in total bone marrow. The cells were then washed and cultured (5 × 105 cells/ml) in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 10% fetal bovine serum, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 2 mm β-mercaptoethanol, granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor (100 units/ml) and interleukin-4 (100 units/ml). On day 2 and 4, the media and nonadherent cells were replaced with fresh media. On day 6, nonadherent cells (DC) were removed and resuspended in fresh medium at the same cell density. Differentiation to DC was confirmed by analysis of CD11c expression by flow cytometry. For studies of DC activation in vitro, the cells were stimulated with 10–100 ng/ml LPS (Escherichia coli, 055:B5) or 25–50 μg/ml poly(I·C) (Amersham Biosciences) and analyzed for CD80, CD86, and CYP4F isoform expression after 24 h. To target DC to popliteal lymph nodes, immature bone marrow-derived DC were labeled for 5 min with 5 μm CFDA-SE (carboxyfluorescein diacetate, succinimidyl ester) dye from (Invitrogen). The cells were washed twice, and then 5 × 105 cells were mixed with 1 μg/ml LPS in a 10-μl volume and injected into the right paw pads of mice. The mice were euthanized 18 h after injection, and popliteal lymph node tissue was dissected, dissociated with 1000 IU/ml collagenase D (Roche Applied Science) for 2 × 1 h at 37 °C, and filtered through a spleen mesh (44Mempel R. Hendrickson S.E. von Andrian U. Nature. 2004; 427: 154-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (1356) Google Scholar). The cells were resuspended in ACK buffer (BioWhittaker) for 5 min, washed in PBS, and centrifuged on 35% bovine serum albumin gradients for 15 min at 7000 rpm, 4 °C. The cells were collected from the interface of the bovine serum albumin gradient, and CFDA-SE dye-stained cells were isolated by flow cytometry for RNA analysis. RNA Blot Analysis—A CYP4F18 cDNA probe was synthesized by labeling a 297-bp PCR product with [α-32P]dCTP by random priming; the PCR product was generated from mouse PMN cDNA with primers F18-2F and F18-6R (Table 1). PCR conditions were 94 °C for 30 s, 60 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 30 s for 30 cycles, and the product was purified using a Geneclean Spin kit (Qbiogene) prior to radiolabeling. A mouse multiple tissue expression array from BD Biosciences (Clontech) was hybridized with the 297-bp probe (2 ng/ml, ∼2 × 106 cpm/ng) for 6 h at 65 °C in 10 ml of ExpressHyb buffer. The array was washed in 2× SSC, 1% SDS at 65 °C five times for 20 min and then 0.1× SSC, 0.5% SDS at 55 °C twice for 20 min and was exposed to Kodak XAR film overnight at -70 °C with an intensifying screen. Hybridization signals were quantified with a PhosphorImager.TABLE 1Summary of primers cDNA positions are relative to the ATG initiation codon (A = +1)NameDirectioncDNAPositionSequence (5′ to 3′)F18-1FSenseCYP4F181–18CGACCATGTCACAGCTGAGCCTGF18-13RAntisenseCYP4F181575–1543TCACTGCGCGCCTGCGCTGAGCGGCTCCACTTTF18-2FSenseCYP4F18172–196AACTGGATCTTGGGACACCTAGGCCF18-6RAntisenseCYP4F18468–444ATGGAAGGCAGGTGTCAGCATGCGAIsoform-specific primers4F13FSenseCYP4F13105–124GGCCTGGATCTATGCCTTCT4F13RAntisenseCYP4F13286–267ACACAGGTCCAACCCAAGAG4F14FSenseCYP4F1455–74TGGAAGACCCTGCTACTGCT4F14RAntisenseCYP4F14222–203CAAGCCCTGCTCTGTAGGAG4F15FSenseCYP4F15196–215ATGATCACACCCACTGAGCA4F15RAntisenseCYP4F15359–340TTTAGGGCTACCGAAGCTGA4F16FSenseCYP4F1673–92GGAGTGGCTTCCTGGATTTT4F16RAntisenseCYP4F16316–297ATGCAGGGTCAACAATCCTC4F18FSenseCYP4F1893–112GGCTTACATCCTGACCCAGA4F18RAntisenseCYP4F18269–250CAGCAGCATGCATCCCTGAA Open table in a new tab Isoform-specific RT-PCR—RNA was extracted from freshly isolated mouse cells and tissues using Tri reagent (Sigma). In addition, total RNA from selected mouse tissues (liver, ovary, and smooth muscle) was purchased from BD Biosciences Clontech. Reverse transcription was performed with a cloned avian myeloblastosis virus first strand cDNA synthesis kit (Invitrogen). Primers summarized in Table 1 (listed under “isoform-specific primers”) were used to detect CYP4F13 (182-bp product), CYP4F14 (168-bp product), CYP4F15 (164-bp product), CYP4F16 (244-bp product), and CYP4F18 (177-bp product) by isoform-specific PCR. The same annealing temperature can be used for all primer sets, but different polymerases/buffer systems require independent optimization to determine the annealing temperature critical to achieve specificity. An annealing temperature of 66 °C was optimal for PCRs containing 1 unit of Taq polymerase and 10–100 ng of DNA in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 9, 50 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 400 nm each primer, and 200 μm dNTPs. The PCR conditions were 94 °C for 30 s, 66 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 30 s; 30 cycles were used unless stated otherwise. Semiquantitative PCR for CYP4F18 was performed by including Quantum RNA Classic 18 S internal standard primers (Ambion); 25 cycles of PCR was representative of the linear range, and the 18 S primers were combined with Competimers (Ambion) in a ratio of 3:7. Alternatively, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase RT-PCR Control Amplimers (BD Biosciences Clontech) were used as an internal control. PCR products were resolved on a 1% agarose gel, and the bands were quantified using image analysis software. Flow Cytometry—DC cultures were stained with allophycocyanin, percyphycoerythrin, or fluoroisothiocyanate-conjugated control IgGs or monoclonal antibodies directed to CD11c, CD80, and CD86 (BD Biosciences) to define immature and mature populations using a double or tri-color labeling. The samples were analyzed by flow cytometry using a FACScalibur instrument and the Cellquest program (BD Biosciences). Expression of CYP4F18 Protein—The full-length cDNA coding region of CYP4F18 was amplified from PMN cDNA by PCR using Pfu polymerase (Stratagene) with primers F18-1F (which places the sequence CGACC immediately upstream of the ATG initiation codon) and F18-13R (which comprises the last 33 bp inclusive of the TGA stop codon). The PCR conditions were 94 °C for 30 s, 60 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 2 min for 30 cycles. A PCR product of 1580 bp was cloned into pCR2.1-TOPO vector (Invitrogen), and sequence analysis confirmed its identity with CYP4F18. The cDNA for CYP4F18 was subcloned into p51polORbp bicistronic baculovirus vector designed for coexpression with NADPH cytochrome P-450 reductase. Preparation of baculovirus, infection of Sf9 cells (at the Protein Expression Center at California Institute of Technology and at Gentest Corporation, Woburn, MA), and fractionation of cell extracts and microsomes was performed as previously described (32Christmas P.

Microsomes were adjusted to a concentration of 7.7 mg protein/ml (Lowry assay), and CYP4F18 expression was confirmed by Western blotting (31Christmas P. Ursino S.R. Fox J.W. Soberman R.J. J. Biol.

Immunofluorescent Microscopy—For indirect immunofluorescent staining of CYP4F18, DC were washed in PBS and cytospun onto slides. The cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 30 min, incubated with 50 mm ammonium chloride for 10 min, and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 4 min. The cells were then blocked in 10% goat serum for 30 min and labeled with affinity-purified rabbit anti-CYP4F3 (10 μg/ml) for 1 h at room temperature. The affinity purified antibody to CYP4F3 has been described previously (32Christmas P. Jones J.P. Patten C.J. Rock D. Zheng Y. Cheng S.M. Weber B.M. Carlesso N. Scadden D.T. Rettie A.E. Soberman R.J.

The secondary antibody was fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Jackson Laboratories), used at a 1:250 dilution in PBS for 1 h at room temperature. Immunofluorescent microscopy was performed using a Nikon FXA photomicroscope and IP Spectrum (Scanalytics, Vienna, VA) acquisition analysis software. Analysis of LTB4 and AA Metabolites by RP-HPLC—A 100-μl reaction mixture containing 1 mm NADPH, 10 μl of Sf9 microsomes expressing CYP4F18, 30 μm LTB4, and 2 μCi of [3H8]LTB4 in 100 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, was incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. After the incubation, the reaction was stopped by adding 100 μl of ice-cold ethanol and centrifuged (10,000 × g) for 10 min. The supernatant was removed, and 1 ml of 100 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, and 1 drop of formic acid was added. The products were extracted (twice) using 1 ml 1:1 (v/v) hexane/ethyl acetate. After vortexing four times for 15 s, the samples were centrifuged at 135 × g for 5 min to separate the two layers. The organic layer was removed and taken to dryness under vacuum. Metabolites were purified by RP-HPLC using a Chromolith Performance RP-18e (4.6 × 100 mm) column. The reversed phase solvents used were 8.3 mm acetic acid adjusted to pH 5.7 with ammonium hydroxide (solvent A) and 65:35 acetonitrile/methanol (solvent B). The initial mobile phase was 25% solvent B, which was held for 3 min. This was followed by a linear gradient to 100% solvent B over 32 min. Initially, 5% of the hexane/ethyl acetate extract was introduced onto the RP-HPLC column, and the effluent was monitored using UV detection at 270 nm and on-line radioactivity. The remainder of the hexane/ethyl acetate extract was then introduced onto the RP-HPLC column, and 2 fractions/min were collected for GC/MS analysis. Gas Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry—The reversed phase HPLC fractions of interest were taken to dryness under vacuum and derivatized for GC/MS analysis by the addition of 50 μl of 5% N,N-diisopropylethylamine in acetonitrile and 50 μl of 5% pentafluorobenzyl bromide in acetonitrile. The samples were kept at room temperature for 30 min and evaporated under a stream of nitrogen. The samples were further derivatized with the addition of 50 μl of acetonitrile and 50 μlof bis(trimethylsilyl)trifluoroacetamide by incubating at 60 °C for 30 min followed by evaporation under nitrogen. The samples were reconstituted in 20 μl of acetonitrile and subjected to GC/MS analysis (35Powell W.S. Gravelle F. J. Biol.

The electron ionization spectra were obtained at an electron energy of 70 eV and provided structural information regarding the hydroxyl group position from fragmentation events adjacent to the trimethylsilyl ether positions. Calcium Flux and Chemotaxis—For cell migration assays, bone marrow cells were isolated from the femurs and tibias of mice by perfusion with sterile PBS (48Gerard N.P. Lu B. Liu P. Craig S.

The mature PMN are recovered at the interface of the 65 and 75% fractions. PMN purity was >97% as determined morphometrically by Diff-Quik staining. The cells were fluorescently labeled with 5 μm calcein AM (Invitrogen), suspended in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 125 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 0.5 mm glucose, 0.2% bovine serum albumin, at 1 × 107/ml (48Gerard N.P.

The cells were also incubated with 30 μm 17-ODYA or buffer containing 0.05% Me2SO (controls) for 30 min and then tested for chemotactic activity in modified Boyden chambers. The cells (0.1 ml) were placed in the upper wells of 3-micron, 6.4-mm FluoroBlok filter inserts (Falcon) with 0.6 ml of buffer containing 1.0, 10, or 100 nm of LTB4 or 20-OH LTB4.

https://openalex.org/W2077867130,"Recent studies suggest that the mucin granule lumen consists of a matrix meshwork embedded in a fluid phase. Secretory products can both diffuse, although very slowly, through the meshwork pores and interact noncovalently with the matrix. Using a green fluorescent protein-mucin fusion protein (SHGFP-MUC5AC/CK) as a FRAP (fluorescence recovery after photobleaching) probe, we have assessed in living mucous cells the relative importance of different protein post-translational modifications on the intragranular organization. Long term inhibition of mucin-type O-glycosylation, sialylation, or sulfation altered SHGFP-MUC5AC/CK characteristic diffusion time (t½), whereas all but sulfation diminished its mobile fraction. Reduction of protein disulfide bonds with tris(hydroxypropyl)phosphine resulted in virtually complete immobilization of the SHGFP-MUC5AC/CK intragranular pool. However, when activity of the vacuolar H+-ATPase was also inhibited, disulfide reduction decreased SHGFP-MUC5AC/CK t½ while diminishing its intraluminal concentration. Similar FRAP profiles were observed in granules that remained in the cells after the addition of a mucin secretagogue. Taken together these results suggest that: (a) the relative content of O-glycans and intragranular anionic groups is crucial for protein diffusion through the intragranular meshwork; (b) protein-protein, rather than carbohydrate-mediated, interactions are responsible for binding of SHGFP-MUC5AC/CK to the immobile fraction, although the degree of matrix O-glycosylation and sialylation affects such interactions; (c) intragranular organization does not depend on covalent multimerization of mucins or the presence of native disulfide bonds in the intragranular mucin/proteins, but rather on specific protein-mediated interactions that are important during the early stages of mucin matrix condensation; (d) alterations of the intragranular matrix precede granule discharge, which can be partial and, accordingly, does not necessarily involve the disappearance of the granule.

In response to specific signals, regulated secretion permits the controlled transport of membrane and secretory products (1Kepes F. Rambourg A. Satiat-Jeunemaitre B. Int. Rev. Cytol. 2005; 242: 55-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 2Burgoyne R.D. Morgan A. Physiol. Rev. 2003; 83: 581-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar). This pathway is supported by an efficient mechanism for importing/packing proteins into secretory granules. Indeed, the biogenesis of regulated secretory granules is initiated when secretory proteins aggregate in the trans-Golgi compartments (3Thiele C. Huttner W.B. Cell Dev. Biol. 1998; 9: 511-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, our understanding of intragranular protein condensation and its regulation still is fragmented and incomplete, especially in exocrine cells. Mucous/goblet cells are specialized in the synthesis and (constitutive/regulated) secretion of a family of glycoproteins known as secreted gel-forming mucins (4Strous G.J. Dekker J. Crit. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 27: 57-92Crossref Scopus (752) Google Scholar, 5Gendler D.J. Spicer A.P. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1995; 57: 607-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (854) Google Scholar, 6Perez-Vilar J. Hill R.L. J.

Mucins are characterized by their large size, high degree of mucin-type O-glycosylation, and the formation of disulfide-linked oligomers/multimers. Together with water and salts, mucins largely determine the viscoelastic and adhesive properties of the mucus secretions that cover the tracheobronchial, gastrointestinal, urogenital, auditory, and conjunctival epithelia. Although the mucus layer lubricates and protects epithelial cells against pathogenic and noxious agents (8Basbaum C. Lemjabbar H. Longphre M. Li D. Gensch E. McNamara N. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 1999; 160: S44-S48Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 9Knowles M.R. Boucher R.C. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 109: 571-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (933) Google Scholar), overproduction of mucus can be detrimental to health, as is evident in lung diseases characterized by a mucus hypersecretory phenotype such as cystic fibrosis (10Perez-Vilar J. Boucher R.C. Free Rad. Biol. Med. 2004; 37: 1564-1577Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The biosynthesis of mucins comprises N-and O-glycosylation, likely C-mannosylation, sulfation, interchain disulfide bond formation, and proteolysis (6Perez-Vilar J. Hill R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31751-31754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar, 11Wickstrom C. Carlstedt I. J. Biol.

Glycobiology. 2004; 14: 325-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Processed mucin oligomers/multimers are stored inside mucin granules, where they likely form a highly condensed polyanionic matrix (14Neutra M.R. Phillips T.L. Phillips T.E. CIBA Found.

Consistent with this notion, intestinal mucous cells with the characteristic mucin granules are not present in mice lacking expression of mMuc2, the gene encoding the major intestinal gel-forming mucin (18Velcich A.

Polyanionic matrices and high intraluminal concentrations of Ca2+ and H+ appear to be common features of regulated secretory granules irrespective of species and the cell type (e.g. 1Kepes F. Rambourg A. Satiat-Jeunemaitre B. Int. Rev. Cytol. 2005; 242: 55-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 19Serafin W.E. Katz H.R. Austen K.F. Stevens R.L. J. Biol.

Ca2+ and H+ likely shield the negative charges in mucin O-linked oligosaccharide chains, facilitating the emergence of physical interactions among intragranular matrix mucins. It has been proposed that at some point during granule biogenesis, and following the same physical laws that govern phase transitions of synthetic polymers (22Tanaka T. Filmore D.J. J. Chem. Phys. 1979; 70: 1214-1220Crossref Scopus (1444) Google Scholar), polyanionic intragranular proteins in general, and mucin oligomers/multimers in particular, undergo a highly cooperative (likely Ca2+/H+-driven) phase transition (condensation) process, which results in the formation of osmotically inert, condensed aggregates (16Verdugo P. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1990; 52: 157-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar, 17Verdugo P. Am. Rev. Respir. Dis. 1991; 144: S33-S37Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Verdugo P. CIBA Found. Symp. 1984; 109: 212-225PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, an ion exchange (Ca2+/K+)-triggered phase transition of the matrix is thought to occur prior to and/or during granule exocytosis, resulting in matrix decondensation and hydration and discharge of entrapped secretory proteins (24Marszalek P.E. Farrell B. Verdugo P. Fernandez J.M. Biophys. J. 1997; 73: 1160-1168Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 25Marszalek P.E. Farrell B. Verdugo P. Fernandez J.M. Biophys.

Thus, fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) 2The abbreviations used are: FRAP, fluorescence recovery after photobleaching; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid; DTT, dithiothreitol; GFP, green fluorescent protein; Mf, mobile fraction; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; SiaNAc, sialic acid; t½, half-recovery time or characteristic diffusion time; THP, tris(hydroxypropyl)phosphine. 2The abbreviations used are: FRAP, fluorescence recovery after photobleaching; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid; DTT, dithiothreitol; GFP, green fluorescent protein; Mf, mobile fraction; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; SiaNAc, sialic acid; t½, half-recovery time or characteristic diffusion time; THP, tris(hydroxypropyl)phosphine. analyses with a mucin-GFP fusion protein suggested that the mucin granule lumen is compartmentalized into a mobile or fluid phase, in which secretory products diffused very slowly, and an immobile, pH-dependent phase (i.e. a “matrix”) to which secretory products were noncovalently bound via pH-dependent interactions (26Perez-Vilar J. Olsen J.C. Chua M. Boucher R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 16868-16881Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). A two-phase, intraluminal organization was proposed independently on the basis of studies on the Ca2+/K+ intragranular ion exchange mechanism of exocytosis (28Nguyen T. Chin W.C. Verdugo P. Nature. 1998; 395: 908-912Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 29Quesada I. Chin W.C. Verdugo P. Biophys. J. 2003; 85: 963-970Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The facts that the same protein probe diffused ∼100-fold faster in the endoplasmic reticulum lumen than within the mucin granule, whereas its diffusion seemed even faster once it reached the extracellular mucus 3J. Perez-Vilar, unpublished observations. 3J. Perez-Vilar, unpublished observations. (26Perez-Vilar J. Olsen J.C. Chua M. Boucher R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 16868-16881Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), supports the notion that the intragranular mucin matrix is in a condensed state. However, the FRAP profiles obtained argued against the existence of an inaccessible, dehydrated condensed mucin matrix surrounded by a dense fluid phase (26Perez-Vilar J. Olsen J.C. Chua M. Boucher R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 16868-16881Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Instead, the mucin meshwork is likely embedded in a fluid phase so that proteins diffuse through its pores and have access to, and interact with, the matrix components. Although these studies are not necessarily in conflict with a phase transition-driven mechanism of matrix condensation, they raise the possibility that specific protein-protein interactions have critical roles at some point during the formation of the matrix meshwork. Using time-lapse and semiquantitative FRAP analysis in live mucous cells, we report here studies aimed at identifying the relative roles in mucin granule organization of mucin post-translational modifications, including O-glycosylation, sulfation, sialylation, and protein disulfide bonding. The intraluminal environment of granules remaining after the addition of mucin secretagogue was also investigated. The results suggest that the intragranular environment can be independently regulated by different factors.

Confocal Microscopy and FRAP Analysis—Cells in confocal medium (Hanks’ balanced solution salt plus 1% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, 5 mm l-glutamine, essential and nonessential amino acids, and 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.8) were observed with a Zeiss LSM 510 (University of North Carolina Michael Hooker Microscopy Facility) at 37 °C on the microscope stage, using 488 nm laser excitation for GFP. FRAP analysis of intragranular SHGFP-MUC5AC/CK in live mucous/goblet cells was carried out using a ×63 (NA 1.4) oil immersion objective as described before (26Perez-Vilar J. Olsen J.C. Chua M. Boucher R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 16868-16881Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Briefly, a spot the size of the laser beam diameter was irreversibly bleached and the fluorescence intensity in the bleached area monitored over time. From these raw data, the mobile fraction (Mf), i.e. the percent of intragranular SHGFP-MUC5AC/CK that diffuses, and the characteristic diffusion time (t½), i.e. the time required to reach 50% of the plateau fluorescence in the bleached area, were derived using standard procedures (26Perez-Vilar J. Olsen J.C. Chua M. Boucher R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 16868-16881Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 38Snapp E. Altan N. Lippincott-Schwartz J. Bonifacino J. Dasso M. Harford J. Lippincott-Schwartz J. Yamada K. Morgan K.S. Current Protocols in Cell Biolog. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York2003Google Scholar). In each case, vehicle- and compound-treated cells were analyzed in parallel. At least three different culture dishes from three independent experiments were processed. The statistical significance of differences between the means of specific parameters in specific pairs of vehicle- and compound-treated cells was assessed by student t tests. Caspase 3/7 Assays—To assess the cellular levels of caspases 3 and 7, cells grown in 4-well slides (Cultek, Inc.) were put on ice for 5 min, washed twice with cold Ca2+/Mg2+-free PBS, and lysed for 15 min at room temperature in 300 μl of 0.5% (v/v) Triton X-100 in PBS/well. The lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 1 min and then diluted 1:100 with sterile water. 1–10 μl of the latter solution was mixed with an equal volume of freshly made caspase 3/7-Glo reagent (Promega, Inc.). The mixture was incubated at room temperature for up to 1 h and light emission measured with a Turner Biosystem 20/20 luminometer. Analysis of Glycoproteins Metabolically Labeled with N-Acetyl-[3H]Glucosamine or 35SO4Na2—Mucous cells grown in 35-mm culture dishes were metabolically labeled at 37 °C with 25 μCi/ml N-acetyl-[3H]glucosamine ([3H]GlcNAc, Amersham Biosciences; 35 Bq/mmol) or 50 μCi/ml 35SO4Na2 (MPB; 74 MBq)) in PFHM-II culture medium (39Philips T.E. Ramos R. Duncan S.L. In Vitro Cell Dev. Biol. Anim. 1995; 31: 421-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) for 24 h in the absence (control sample) or presence of the indicated compounds. At the end of the labeling, the cells were put on ice for 5 min and the culture medium collected and cleared from cell debris by centrifugation. The cell layer was rinsed with cold PBS and then extracted at 4 °C with 4 m guanidine HCl, 0.1 m sodium acetate, 4% (w/v) CHAPS, 100 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, pH 5.8 (extraction buffer; 3 ml/dish), for 30 min with agitation. The lysates were cleared by centrifugation and the supernatant diluted with extraction buffer to a concentration of 0.5–0.7 mg of protein/ml. Radioactive proteins were separated from unincorporated radioactive probe by passing 500 μl of cell lysate through a 5-ml Sephadex G-50 (fine) column equilibrated in 6 m urea, 0.1 m Tris-HCl, 5 mm EDTA, 0.5% CHAPS (w/v), 100 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, pH 8.0 (elution buffer). The proteins were eluted with elution buffer and 0.5-ml fractions collected. The radioactivity in each fraction was measured by scintillation counting. To determine the incorporation of the radioactive label into high molecular weight glycoproteins/mucins, cell lysates were dialyzed against 6 m urea, 0.1 m Tris-HCl, 5 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, for 18 h at 4 °C, then reduced with 20 mm DTT for 18 h at room temperature and carboxymethylated with freshly prepared 20 mm iodoacetamide for 30 min at 25 °C in the dark (40Thornton D.J. Howard M. Devine P.L. Sheehan J.K. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 227: 162-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Proteins (30 μg/well) were separated and visualized by standard gradient (4–20%) SDS-PAGE and fluorography. Alternatively, proteins were separated in 1% SDS-agarose gels as described previously (40Thornton D.J. Howard M. Devine P.L. Sheehan J.K. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 227: 162-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), and equal square pieces (∼0.5 × 0.5 cm2) were cut from the top to the bottom of the agarose gels. The gel pieces were melted with guanidine thiocyanate, pH 8, at 65 °C for 10 min and mixed with 2.5 ml of Safety Solve prior to counting the total radioactivity in a scintillation counter. Protein Blotting of Endogenous MUC5AC Separated in Agarose Gels—Total cellular proteins were extracted, separated by SDS-agarose gel electrophoresis, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and MUC5AC detected with specific antibodies following published procedures (40Thornton D.J. Howard M. Devine P.L. Sheehan J.K. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 227: 162-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). A mouse anti-human MUC5AC monoclonal antibody (2Q445; U. S. Biologicals) recognizing the unglycosylated tandem repeat region of MUC5AC (41Sheehan J.K. Brazeau C. Kutay S. Pigeon H. Kirkham S. Howard M. Thornton D.J. Biochemistry. 2000; 347: 37-44Crossref Google Scholar), and a specific rabbit antiserum, named MUC5AC-062, obtained against a peptide (TWTTWFDVDFPS) of the MUC5AC Cys-5 subdomain, respectively, were employed in these studies. As judged by protein blotting, this antiserum specifically detects the same molecular species of MUC5AC recognized by another well characterized rabbit anti-MUC5AC (41Sheehan J.K. Brazeau C. Kutay S. Pigeon H. Kirkham S. Howard M. Thornton D.J. Biochemistry. 2000; 347: 37-44Crossref Google Scholar), including cystine-reduced, unglycosylated, and O-glycosylated monomers, but not unreduced species of this mucin (not shown). Other Methods—Cellular DNA was purified from cell extracts using the DNeasy Tissue kit from Qiagen and its concentration estimated by absorbance at 260 nm. Protein concentration was determined by the bicinchoninic acid assay using reagents from Pierce. The sialic acid content in cultures of HT29-SHGFP-MUC5AC/CK cells was assessed by microscopy using SNA-biotin (Vector Laboratories) as the specific label. Thus, cells were fixed with methanol at -20 °C, nonspecific binding sites blocked with 10% (w/v) bovine serum albumin in PBS, and sialic acid residues located with SNA-biotin (0.05 μg/ml in PBS) and streptavidin-rhodamine. XY serial images of the cultures were obtained via confocal microscopy. Inhibition of Mucin-type O-Glycosylation Alters SHGFP-MUC5AC/CK Intragranular Mobile Fraction and Mobility—Mucin-type O-glycosylation is the major post-translational modification of gel-forming mucins, and it can represent up to 90% of their molecular weights (4Strous G.J. Dekker J. Crit. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 27: 57-92Crossref Scopus (752) Google Scholar). To assess the relative importance of this modification in intragranular organization, O-glycosylation was inhibited in HT29-SHGFP-MUC5AC/CK mucous intestinal adenocarcinoma cells (26Perez-Vilar J. Olsen J.C. Chua M. Boucher R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 16868-16881Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). These cells stably express SHGFP-MUC5AC/CK, a fusion protein consisting of a secreted form of GFP and the CK domain of MUC5AC, one of the five human gel-forming mucins known. SHGFP-MUC5AC/CK does not covalently bind to endogenous MUC5AC, but it is stored inside the mucin granules (26Perez-Vilar J. Olsen J.C. Chua M. Boucher R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 16868-16881Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). To inhibit O-glycosylation, cells were grown in the presence of compound 2-68A. This uridine derivative is a specific competitive inhibitor of the UDP-GalNAc:polypeptide α-GalNAc-transferase family of glycosyltransferases that initiate mucin-type O-glycosylation (31Hang H.C. Yu C. Ten Hagen K.G. Tian E. Winans K.A. Tabak L.A. Bertozzi C.R. Chem. Biol. 2004; 11: 337-345Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Cultures incubated with vehicle (dimethyl sulfoxide) (Fig. 1A, a and b) or compound 2-68A (c and d) appeared to have comparable number of mucous cells with numerous mucin granules each (Fig. 1B), suggesting that compound 2-68A was not toxic under these conditions. Because it has been reported that inhibition of O-glycosylation by uridine derivatives triggers cellular apoptosis in different cell types (31Hang H.C. Yu C. Ten Hagen K.G. Tian E. Winans K.A. Tabak L.A. Bertozzi C.R. Chem. Biol. 2004; 11: 337-345Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 42Tian E. Hagen K.G. Shum L. Hang H.C. Imbert Y. Young Jr., W.W. Bertozzi C.R. Tabak L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 50382-50390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), it was important to assess whether the degree of cellular apoptosis differed between control and 2-68A-incubated cultures. Thus, the activities of caspases 3 and 7, two well characterized apoptosis markers (43Wang Z.B. Liu Y.Q. Cui Y.F. Cell Biol. Int. 2005; 29: 489-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar), were determined in cell lysates of mucous cells incubated for 48 h in the presence of vehicle or compound 2-68A. As shown in Fig. 1C, the respective cellular levels of caspase 3/7 were very similar, suggesting that under these experimental conditions, compound 2-68A did not induce apoptosis. To validate these results, we generated NIH-3T3 cells stably expressing SHGFP-MUC5AC/CK, the same protein expressed by the mucous cell line. NIH-3T3 is a cell line known to undergo apoptosis upon inhibition of O-glycosylation with uridine derivatives (42Tian E. Hagen K.G. Shum L. Hang H.C. Imbert Y. Young Jr., W.W. Bertozzi C.R. Tabak L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 50382-50390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Consistent with these reports, the addition of compound 2-68A to NIH-3T3-SHGFP-MUC5AC/CK fibroblasts resulted in increased caspase 3/7 activities within an hour (Fig. 1D) and widespread and extensive cellular apoptosis 24 h later (Fig. 1E). The effectiveness of compound 2-68A as an O-glycosylation inhibitor in mucous cells was assessed by determining the incorporation of a radioactive monosaccharide into cellular glycoproteins. In these studies, cells preincubated for 24 h with vehicle (dimethyl sulfoxide) or compound 2-68A were metabolically labeled with [3H]GlcNAc for another 24 h in the presence of dimethyl sulfoxide or compound 2-68A. 3H-Labeled proteins from cell lysates were separated from unincorporated radioactive monosaccharide by gel filtration and the radioactivity in each fraction quantified. Compared with control cells, cells incubated with compound 2-68A had a much smaller signal in the excluded volume fractions (Fig. 1F), which contain proteins eluted from the column. Similarly, compound 2-68A inhibited incorporation of [3H]GlcNAc into high molecular weight glycoproteins/mucins fractionated by SDS-agarose gel electrophoresis (see supplemental Fig. s1). Consistent with these results, the cellular binding of SNA, a lectin specific for sialic acid residues, was reduced in compound 2-68A-treated cells (see supplemental Fig. s2). These results are consistent with substantial inhibition of mucin type O-glycosylation by compound 2-68A in cultured mucous cells, as has been reported in other cell types treated with uridine derivatives in vitro and in vivo (31Hang H.C. Yu C. Ten Hagen K.G. Tian E. Winans K.A. Tabak L.A. Bertozzi C.R. Chem. Biol. 2004; 11: 337-345Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 42Tian E. Hagen K.G. Shum L.

Having provided experimental evidence that mucin-type O-glycosylation was inhibited efficiently, whereas the mucous cells were not apoptotic, we analyzed the intragranular FRAP parameters in granules from vehicle- or compound 2-68A-incubated living mucous cells processed in parallel. Because the inhibitor was added to cultures in which in vitro mucous cell differentiation was already in progress (26Perez-Vilar J. Olsen J.C. Chua M. Boucher R.C"

The extracellular domain of PTPμ contains motifs commonly found in cell adhesion molecules. The intracellular domain of PTPμ contains two conserved catalytic domains, only the membrane-proximal domain has catalytic activity. The unique features of PTPμ make it an attractive molecule to transduce signals upon cell-cell contact. PTPμ has been shown to regulate cadherin-mediated cell adhesion, neurite outgrowth, and axon guidance. Protein kinase C is a component of the PTPμ signaling pathway utilized to regulate these events. To aid in the further characterization of PTPμ signaling pathways, we used a series of GST-PTPμ fusion proteins, including catalytically inactive and substrate trapping mutants, to identify PTPμ-interacting proteins. We identified IQGAP1, a known regulator of the Rho GTPases, Cdc42 and Rac1, as a novel PTPμ-interacting protein. We show that this interaction is due to direct binding. In addition, we demonstrate that amino acid residues 765-958 of PTPμ, which include the juxtamembrane domain and 35 residues of the first phosphatase domain, mediate the binding to IQGAP1. Furthermore, we demonstrate that constitutively active Cdc42, and to a lesser extent Rac1, enhances the interaction of PTPμ and IQGAP1. These data indicate PTPμ may regulate Rho-GTPase-dependent functions of IQGAP1 and suggest that IQGAP1 is a component of the PTPμ signaling pathway.

Reversible protein-tyrosine phosphorylation is a primary mode of regulation for several cellular functions including growth, differentiation, adhesion, and protein trafficking. The overall tyrosine phosphorylation state of a protein is regulated by protein-tyrosine kinases (1Pawson T. Eur. J. Cancer. 2002; 38: S3-S10Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and protein-tyrosine phosphatases (2Tonks N.K. Neel B.G. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 182-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar). Similar to the family of protein-tyrosine kinases, the family of protein-tyrosine phosphatases includes both non-receptor and receptor type enzymes. Unlike the tyrosine kinases, however, few substrates and downstream signaling molecules of tyrosine phosphatases have been identified. This manuscript focuses on the receptor protein-tyrosine phosphatase (RPTP), 2The abbreviations used are: PTP, protein-tyrosine phosphatase; RPTP, receptor PTP; GST, glutathione S-transferase; GAP, GTPase-activating protein; ERK2, extracellular signal-regulated kinase 2; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; PKC, protein kinase C; HA, hemagglutinin; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; GFP, green fluorescent protein; DSP, dithiobis(succinimidyl propionate); CA, constitutively active; DN, dominant negative; RGC, retinal ganglion cell. PTPμ, and the identification of novel PTPμ-interacting proteins to aid in the elucidation of the PTPμ signaling pathway. The extracellular domain of PTPμ contains sequence motifs similar to those in cell adhesion molecules including: a MAM domain, an immunoglobulin (Ig) domain, and four fibronectin type-III repeats (3Gebbink M.F. van Etten I. Hateboer G. Suijkerbuijk R. Beijersbergen R.L. Geurts van Kessel A. Moolenaar W.H. FEBS Lett. 1991; 290: 123-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The MAM domain (Meprins, A5, PTP Mu) is a sequence motif that is suggested to play a role in protein dimerization (4Cismasiu V.B. Denes S.A. Reilander H. Michel H. Szedlacsek S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 26922-26931Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Ig domains are disulfide-bonded structures found in many cell surface proteins and have been shown to mediate homophilic and heterophilic binding between cell adhesion molecules. Fibronectin type-III motifs, originally identified in the extracellular matrix protein fibronectin, are present in many cell adhesion molecules. PTPμ has been shown to mediate homophilic binding in non-adhesive Sf9 insect cells (5Brady-Kalnay S.M. Flint A.J. Tonks N.K. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 961-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar, 6Gebbink M.F. Zondag G.C. Wubbolts R.W. Beijersbergen R.L. van Etten I. Moolenaar W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16101-16104Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The juxtamembrane domain of PTPμ contains a region of homology to the conserved intracellular domain of the cadherins. Cadherins are calcium-dependent adhesion molecules that mediate cell-cell adhesion and adherens junction formation (7Gumbiner B.M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 6: 622-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (1213) Google Scholar). Cadherins are anchored to the actin cytoskeleton indirectly through the binding of catenins (7Gumbiner B.M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 6: 622-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (1213) Google Scholar). The catenin family of proteins includes α-catenin, β-catenin, plakoglobin, and p120 catenin. We have demonstrated that PTPμ interacts with classical cadherins such as N-cadherin, E-cadherin, and R-cadherin and associates with these cadherins in a complex containing α-catenin and β-catenin (8Brady-Kalnay S.M. Rimm D.L. Tonks N.K. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 977-986Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar, 9Brady-Kalnay S.M. Mourton T. Nixon J.P. Pietz G.E. Kinch M. Chen H. Brackenbury R. Rimm D.L. Del Vecchio R.L. Tonks N.K. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 287-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). PTPμ was also shown to bind p120 catenin (10Zondag G.C. Reynolds A.B. Moolenaar W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11264-11269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). PTPμ has two conserved intracellular catalytic domains, of which only the membrane-proximal domain has been shown to be catalytically active (11Gebbink M.F. Verheijen M.H. Zondag G.C. van Etten I. Moolenaar W.H. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 13516-13522Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The cell adhesion-like extracellular domain of PTPμ, its intracellular catalytic domain and ability to interact with the cadherin/catenin complex, make PTPμ an attractive candidate for regulating cadherin-mediated adhesion and migration. In support of this idea, we demonstrated that re-expression of PTPμ in LNCaP cells restores E-cadherin-mediated cell-cell adhesion (12Hellberg C.B. Burden-Gulley S.M. Pietz G.E. Brady-Kalnay S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 11165-11173Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Furthermore, PTPμ expression and catalytic activity are required for N-cadherin mediated neurite outgrowth (13Burden-Gulley S.M. Brady-Kalnay S.M. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 1323-1336Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). In a continuing effort to understand the PTPμ signaling pathway, we set out to identify potential PTPμ substrates and interacting proteins using a previously published strategy (14Holsinger L.J. Ward K. Duffield B. Zachwieja J. Jallal B. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 7067-7076Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). PTPs have a conserved aspartate residue, which serves as a general acid during catalysis. The structural data on the PTP catalytic domain suggest that mutation of the aspartate residue to alanine (d-A) creates a “substrate trap” by affecting only the Vmax and not the Km of the phosphatase (15Flint A.J. Tiganis T. Barford D. Tonks N.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1680-1685Crossref PubMed Scopus (681) Google Scholar). Holsinger et al. (14Holsinger L.J. Ward K. Duffield B. Zachwieja J. Jallal B. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 7067-7076Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) used a fusion protein consisting of an intracellular D1205A mutant of the RPTP, DEP-1, fused to glutathione S-transferase (GST), to isolate substrates from lysates of cells treated with the protein-tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor pervanadate. They found that DEP-1 associates with p120-catenin. Palka et al. (16Palka H.L. Park M. Tonks N.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 5728-5735Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar) performed similar experiments with DEP-1 and identified additional substrates including the hepatocyte growth factor receptor (met) and Gab1 as well as p120-catenin. We generated a D1063A mutant using the intracellular domain of PTPμ (iPTPμDA) and expressed it as a bacterial GST fusion protein. The iPTPμDA fusion protein was used in pull-down assays with A549 cell lysates and associated proteins were identified by immunoblotting. Using this strategy, we identified IQGAP1 as a PTPμ-interacting protein. IQGAP1 was originally identified as a putative RasGAP based on a region of IQGAP1 with significant homology to the catalytic domain of RasGAPs (17Weissbach L. Settleman J. Kalady M.F. Snijders A.J. Murthy A.E. Yan Y.X. Bernards A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20517-20521Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). IQGAP1 neither exhibits RasGAP activity nor binds to Ras but directly interacts with the Rho GTPases, Rac1 and Cdc42, in their GTP-bound state (18Briggs M.W. Sacks D.B. FEBS Lett. 2003; 542: 7-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). IQGAP1 has no GAP activity toward Cdc42 or Rac1. In fact, IQGAP1 stabilizes Cdc42 in its GTP-bound state (19Hart M.J.

In addition to a RasGAP-related domain, IQGAP1 contains a calponin homology domain, a WW domain, and four IQ motifs, similar to the ones found in unconventional myosins, that mediate interactions of IQGAP1 with calmodulin (17Weissbach L.

It is well established that members of the Rho-family of GTPases regulate actin cytoskeleton remodeling. The most well known members of this family include Cdc42, Rac1, and RhoA, which generate the formation of filopodia, lamellipodia, and stress fibers, respectively (32Nobes C.D. Hall A. Cell. 1995; 81: 53-62Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3732) Google Scholar). IQGAP1 represents a protein that can link cytoskeletal proteins to Rho-family GTPases, specifically Cdc42 and Rac1 (20Swart-Mataraza J.M. Li Z. Sacks D.B. J. Biol.

We show that the interaction between PTPμ and IQGAP1 is direct and enhanced by activated Cdc42 and to a lesser extent, Rac1. Furthermore, we demonstrate PTPμ regulates neurite outgrowth via IQGAP1. Antibodies—Polyclonal antibodies to IQGAP1 (used for immunocytochemistry) and ERK2 were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Monoclonal antibodies to IQGAP1 (used for immunoblotting), β-catenin, and E-cadherin were purchased from Transduction Laboratories (San Diego, CA). An antibody to phospho-p44/42 MAPK (p-ERK1/2) was purchased from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). An antibody to calmodulin was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY). An anti-HA-peroxidase antibody used to detect the Rho GTPase fusion proteins was purchased from Roche Applied Science. A polyclonal antibody generated against the extracellular domain of PTPμ (494) and a monoclonal antibody generated against the intracellular domain of PTPμ (SK18) have been described previously (5Brady-Kalnay S.M.

A monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine antibody was a gift from Nick Tonks (Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory) and has been described previously (35Garton A.J. Burnham M.R. Bouton A.H. Tonks N.K. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 877-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). A monoclonal antibody to N-cadherin was a gift from Margaret Wheelock (University of Nebraska) and has been described previously (36Knudsen K.A. Soler A.P. Johnson K.R. Wheelock M.J. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 67-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar). Cell Culture—A549 non-small cell lung carcinoma cells were maintained in F-12 media (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, and 1 μg/ml gentamicin at 37 °C, 5% CO2. Sf21 insect cells were maintained in Sf-900 II SFM media (Invitrogen) at 27 °C. Expression of Fusion Proteins in Escherichia coli—Plasmids containing intracellular PTPμ GST fusion proteins (iPTPμ-JMD, iPTPμ-Δ765-815, iPTPμWT, iPTPμCS, iPTPμDA, iPTPμWT-ΔD2, iPTPμDA-ΔD2) or GST alone were expressed in E. coli under the control of the lac promoter. The iPTPμ-Δ765-816 (B4), iPTPμWT (B5), and iPTPμCS (B5m) have been described (11Gebbink M.F. Verheijen M.H. Zondag G.C. van Etten I. Moolenaar W.H. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 13516-13522Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). We generated the iPTPμDA construct (D1063A mutation) using site-directed mutagenesis. We generated the iPTPμWT-ΔD2 and iPTPμDA-ΔD2 constructs by restriction digestion of iPTPμWT and iPTPμDA, respectively, with BamHI, which cuts at 3532 bp. iPTPμ-JMD was generated by restriction digest of iPTPμWT-ΔD2 with AccI and ClaI. To isolate functional iPTPμ-GST fusion proteins, proteins were isolated from E. coli as follows. Bacteria were resuspended in 10 ml of resuspension buffer (0.1 m NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 1 mm EDTA) and incubated on ice for 15 min. To lyse bacterial cells 1 ml of 0.5 m EDTA, 1.1 ml of 20% Triton X-100, 55 μl of 1 m dithiothreitol, 10 μl of β-mercaptoethanol, 100 μl of 100 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 30 μl of protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma) was added to 10 ml of resuspended cells. Cells were sonicated and spun at 15,000 rpm for 25 min. GST fusion proteins were isolated from the cleared supernatant using glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Biosciences). Expression and protein concentration of GST fusion proteins was determined by Coomassie stain. Isolated fusion proteins adsorbed onto glutathione-Sepharose were used in the GST pull-down experiments as described below. For pull-down assays performed in the absence of pervanadate treatment, GST fusion proteins were isolated from E. coli using PBST (1% Triton X-100, 1 mm benzamidine, and protease inhibitor cocktail in PBS). GST Pull-down Experiments—A549 cells were grown to 85-95% confluence. Cells were collected by scraping into lysis buffer containing 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 1% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm benzamidine, and protease inhibitor cocktail. Cells were incubated on ice for 30 min and then centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 3 min. The supernantant was saved and its protein concentration determined using the Bradford method (37Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216204) Google Scholar). Equal amounts of protein (1 mg) were added to equal amounts of the iPTPμ GST constructs or GST alone adsorbed to glutathione-Sepharose. Samples were rocked at 4 °C for 2.5 h, washed four times with lysis buffer, and incubated at 95 °C for 5 min in 2× SDS sample buffer. One-third of the sample was resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose for immunoblot analysis as described previously (8Brady-Kalnay S.M. Rimm D.L. Tonks N.K. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 977-986Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Pull-down experiments using purified His-IQGAP1 from Sf21 cells were performed in PBS, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm benzamidine, and protease inhibitor cocktail. Isolation of TAT Fusion Proteins—TAT fusions of the Rho family GTPases Cdc42, Rac1, and RhoA were obtained from Dr. Steven Dowdy (University of California San Diego, La Jolla, CA). The Rho GTPase fusion proteins contain an N-terminal His6-tag for purification, a TAT-tag for protein transduction, and a HA-tag for protein detection (38Soga N. Namba N. McAllister S. Cornelius L. Teitelbaum S.L. Dowdy S.F. Kawamura J. Hruska K.A. Exp. Cell Res. 2001; 269: 73-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The fusion proteins were expressed in E. coli under the control of the lac promoter and purified on TALON metal affinity resin (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA). Expression and protein concentration of TAT fusion proteins was determined by Bradford assay and verified by immunoblot using anti-HA-tag antibodies. Purification of His-IQGAP1—IQGAP1 was cloned into pFast Bac HT as follows. The gene for full-length IQGAP1 was cut from pcDNA3-Myc-IQGAP1 (39Ho Y.D. Joyal J.L. Li Z. Sacks D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 464-470Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar) with XbaI and partially digested with BamHI. The construct was inserted into pFast Bac HT at BamHI and XbaI sites. pFast Bac HT-IQGAP1 was transformed into DH10 Bac. The recombinant Bacmid DNA of IQGAP1 was isolated and used to infect Sf21 insect cells. Forty-eight h post-infection, Sf21 cells were lysed and His-IQGAP1 purified using the QIAexpress Ni-NTA Fast Start kit (Qiagen, Inc., Valencia, CA) as indicated in the manufacturer’s protocol with the modification that 1% Triton was included in all buffers with the exception of the elution buffer. Purity of the His-IQGAP1 protein was determined by silver stain and verified by immunoblot with a monoclonal anti-IQGAP1 antibody. Immunocytochemistry—A549 cells were plated in Lab Tech II chamber slides (Nalge Nunc International Corp., Rochester, NY). When the cells reached the desired confluence (1-3 days post-plating) they were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min. Cells were then washed with PBS three times and permeabilized using 0.5% saponin in blocking buffer (20% goat serum, 1% bovine serum albumin in PBS) for 30 min. Primary antibodies were diluted in blocking buffer plus 0.5% saponin and incubated overnight at 4 °C. After incubation with primary antibody, cells were rinsed five times with TNT buffer (0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.15 m NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20). Secondary antibodies (either goat anti-mouse fluorescein isothiocyanate, goat anti-mouse Texas Red, or goat anti-rabbit fluorescein isothiocyanate from ICN Biochemicals, Irvine, CA) were diluted in blocking buffer plus saponin and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. After incubation with secondary antibody, cells were washed five times with TNT buffer and once with distilled water. Molecular Probes SlowFade® Light Antifade kit was used to minimize quenching. Slides were imaged using a Nikon (Tokyo, Japan) TE200 inverted microscope, and images were collected with a Spot RT digital camera and image acquisition software (Diagnostic Instruments, Inc., Sterling Heights, MI). Baculovirus Infection of A549 Cells—Baculovirus containing a mammalian expression plasmid for GFP-tagged wild-type PTPμ was generated as previously described using the pBacMam-2 vector from Novagen (40Chattopadhyay N. Wang Z. Ashman L.K. Brady-Kalnay S.M. Kreidberg J.A. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 163: 1351-1362Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). For co-localization studies, A549 cells were plated in Lab Tech II chamber slides 24 h prior to infection with baculovirus. For infection, 200 μl of viral supernatant was added to chamber slide wells containing cells in 200 μl of medium and incubated 2 h at 37°C,5%CO2. After the 2-h incubation, all medium was removed from the cells and replaced with media containing 150 nm trichostatin A (Sigma). Cells were incubated at 37 °C, 5% CO2 overnight. The following day immunocytochemistry for IQGAP1 was performed as described above. Immunoprecipitations—A549 cells were grown to 90% confluence. Cells were washed twice with PBS and treated with the cross-linking reagent DSP (1 mm, Pierce) for 10 min at room temperature. Tris, pH 7.5, was added to 50 mm for 15 min at room temperature, then the cells were washed once with PBS. Cells were lysed in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm benzamidine, and protease inhibitor cocktail. Samples were sonicated and centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 5 min. Supernatants were saved and protein concentrations determined using the Bradford method. Immunoprecipitations were performed with equal amounts of supernatant protein (400 μg) using protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) preloaded with a rabbit polyclonal antibody directed to an extracellular epitope of PTPμ (494) or non-immune rabbit serum. Samples were rocked at 4 °C for 3-4 h. Beads were washed four times with lysis buffer and heated to 37 °C for 15 min and 95 °C for 5 min in 2× SDS sample buffer. Immunoprecipitated proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and immunoblot. Bonhoeffer Stripe Assay—The stripe assay used was a modified version of the Bonhoeffer method (41Vielmetter J. Stolze B. Bonhoeffer F. Stuermer C.A. Exp. Brain Res. 1990; 81: 283-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) described previously (42Burden-Gulley S.M. Ensslen S.E. Brady-Kalnay S.M. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 3615-3627Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, tissue cultures dishes were coated with nitrocellulose (43Lagenaur C. Lemmon V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 7753-7757Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar) and allowed to dry before applying a silicon lane matrix to the dish. Alternating stripes of laminin and PTP-Fc chimera containing Texas Red-conjugated bovine serum albumin (for visualization of the lanes) were generated as follows. 80 ng of PTPμ-Fc chimera (described previously; Ref. 44Rosdahl J.A. Ensslen S.E. Niedenthal J.A. Brady-Kalnay S.M. J. Neurobiol. 2003; 56: 199-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) was injected into the channels of the silicon lane matrix, incubated for 10 min, aspirated, and then replaced with a fresh aliquot of the same substrate two additional times. All remaining binding sites within the lanes were blocked with bovine serum albumin (fraction V; Sigma) and rinsed with calcium-magnesium-free phosphate buffer. The matrix was removed, and 1.75 μg of laminin (Biomedical Technologies Inc., Stoughton, MA) was spread across the lane area and incubated for 20 min. Explants from E8 chick nasal retina were grown on the alternating stripes of laminin and PTPμ for 48 h. Quantitation of the stripe assays was performed using a rating scale previously described (45Walter J. Henke-Fahle S. Bonhoeffer F. Development (Camb.). 1987; 101: 909-913PubMed Google Scholar, 46Ensslen S.E. Brady-Kalnay S.M. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2004; 25: 558-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Neurites that show no preference for either substrate are assessed at 0. Neurites that grow exclusively on one substrate are assessed at 3. Neurites that grow mainly on the laminin lanes with an occasional neurite crossing over the PTPμ lanes are assessed at 2, while an assessment of 1 is given when there is a significant amount of neurite crossing but a tendency to fasciculate on laminin. To perturb IQGAP1 function, a 6 μm concentration of either a TAT-tagged, scrambled peptide or an IQGAP1 peptide containing an N-terminal TAT protein transduction sequence was added at the time of explant. The IQGAP1 peptide corresponds to amino acids 1054-1077 of IQGAP1 plus the N-terminal TAT sequence (GRKKRRQRRRMVVSFNRGARGQNALRQILAPVVK, synthesized by Genemed Synthesis, San Fransico, CA). A peptide comprising amino acids 1054-1077 of IQGAP1 (MK24) is known to compete the interaction of IQGAP1 with Cdc42 and Rac1 (47Mataraza J.M. Briggs M.W. Li Z. Frank R. Sacks D.B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 305: 315-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). IQGAP1 Associates with PTPμ in Pull-down Assays—To identify potential PTPμ-interacting proteins we used a previously published strategy employing GST fusion proteins to pull down associated proteins (14Holsinger L.J. Ward K. Duffield B. Zachwieja J. Jallal B. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 7067-7076Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 16Palka H.L. Park M. Tonks N.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 5728-5735Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). PTPs have a conserved aspartate residue, which serves as a general acid during catalysis. The structural data on the PTP catalytic domain suggest that mutation of the aspartate residue to alanine (Asp → Ala) creates a “substrate trap” by affecting only the Vmax and not the Km of the phosphatase (15Flint A.J. Tiganis T. Barford D. Tonks N.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1680-1685Crossref PubMed Scopus (681) Google Scholar). The “substrate trapping” mutant (Asp → Ala) retains normal affinity for its substrate but catalysis is reduced; therefore it binds irreversibly to its substrate. We used a series of intracellular PTPμ-GST fusion proteins (Fig. 1), including a D1063A mutant (iPTPμDA), immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose in pull-down assays to identify PTPμ-interacting proteins. Lysates from confluent A549 cells treated with or without the tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor, pervanadate, were incubated with the GST fusion proteins, and associated proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and identifi"
https://openalex.org/W2063929272,"The upper 50-kDa region of myosin may be critical for coupling between the nucleotide- and actin-binding regions. We introduced a tetracysteine motif in the upper 50-kDa domain (residues 292-297) of myosin V containing a single IQ domain (MV 1IQ), allowing us to label this site with the fluorescein biarscenical hairpin-binding dye (FlAsH) (MV 1IQ FlAsH). The enzymatic properties of MV 1IQ FlAsH were similar to those of unlabeled MV 1IQ except for a 3-fold reduced ADP-release rate. MV 1IQ FlAsH was also capable of moving actin filaments in the in vitro motility assay. To examine rotation of the upper 50-kDa region, we determined the difference in the degree of energy transfer from N-methylanthraniloyl (mant)-labeled nucleotides to FlAsH in both steady-state and transient kinetic experiments. The energy transfer efficiency was higher with mant-ATP (0.65 ± 0.02) compared with mant-ADP (0.55 ± 0.02) in the absence of actin. Stopped-flow measurements suggested that the energy transfer efficiency decreased with phosphate release (0.04 s-1) in the absence of actin. In contrast, upon mixing MV 1IQ FlAsH in the ADP·Pi state with actin, a decrease in the energy transfer signal was observed at a rate of 13 s-1, similar to the ADP release rate. Our results demonstrate there was no change in the energy transfer signal upon actin-activated phosphate release and suggest that actin binding alters the dynamics of the upper 50-kDa region, which may be critical for the ability of myosin to bind tightly to both ADP and actin.

Myosins consist of a superfamily of molecular motor proteins that use the energy from ATP hydrolysis to generate force and motion through a cyclic interaction with actin filaments (1Sellers J.R. Myosins.2nd Ed. Oxford University Press, Oxford, UK1999Google Scholar). The structural details of how conformational changes in myosin are coupled to specific steps in the actomyosin ATPase cycle have yet to be fully elucidated. The current working model suggests that small changes in the nucleotide-binding region (switch I and switch II) are communicated to the lever arm region and amplified to generate force and motion (2Geeves M.A. Holmes K.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 687-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (633) Google Scholar). One key question that remains is how myosin changes conformation to alter its affinity for actin in a nucleotide-dependent manner. The myosin V crystal structures (3Coureux P. Wells A.L. Menetrey J.

Science. 1993; 261: 58-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (1450) Google Scholar) suggest that the large cleft that separates the actin-binding region and extends from the nucleotide-binding site may change conformation in a nucleotide-dependent manner. However, it is unclear how the coupling between the nucleotide-binding region and actin-binding cleft occurs. The structure of myosin subfragment 1 can be described by three domains generated by trypsin cleavage: a 25-kDa N-terminal domain, a central 50-kDa domain, and a 20-kDa C-terminal domain (Fig. 1). The actin-binding domain is separated into the upper and lower 50-kDa domains by a 50-kDa cleft, also known as the actin-binding cleft. The actin-binding cleft extends from near the active site to the actin-binding region, making it a logical candidate for communication between the nucleotide- and actin-binding domains (9Rayment I. Rypniewski W.R. Schmidt-Base K. Smith R. Tomchick D.R. Benning M.M. Winkelmann D.A. Wesenberg G. Holden H.M. Science. 1993; 261: 50-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (1872) Google Scholar, 10Rayment I. Holden H.M. Whittaker M. Yohn C.B. Lorenz M. Holmes K.C. Milligan R.A. Science. 1993; 261: 58-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (1450) Google Scholar). The atomic structures demonstrate a rotation of the upper 50-kDa region in the nucleotide-free structure of myosin V, which results in closure of the actin-binding cleft, compared with the near rigor and ATP-bound states (4Coureux P. Sweeney H.L. Houdusse A. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 4527-4537Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). In addition, cryoelectron microscopy demonstrated a structural change in the upper 50-kDa region of smooth muscle myosin when bound to actin in the presence and absence of ADP (6Volkmann N. Hanein D. Ouyang G. Trybus K.M. DeRosier D.J. Lowey S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 12: 1147-1155Google Scholar). Another study demonstrated that a tryptophan residue in the upper 50-kDa region of the cleft changed conformation with kinetics identical to that of ATP-induced dissociation from actin (7Yengo C.M. De La Cruz E.M. Chrin L.R. Gaffney II, D.P. Berger C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 24114-24119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Finally, a previous study that placed pyrene probes on either side of the cleft monitored a change in pyrene excimer fluorescence upon ATP-induced dissociation from actin (8Conibear P.B. Bagshaw C.R. Fajer P.G. Kovacs M. Malnasi-Csizmadia A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 831-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Thus, the cleft appears to play a role in an ATP-dependent conformational change that results in a large reduction in affinity for actin. It has been proposed that the upper 50-kDa rotation occurs by distortion of a highly conserved β sheet, which may be a conformational change similar to that observed in the sequential product release of F1-ATPase (4Coureux P. Sweeney H.L. Houdusse A. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 4527-4537Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar, 11Menz R.I. Walker J.E. Leslie A.G. Cell. 2001; 10: 331-341Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (397) Google Scholar). However, little is known about how the cleft changes conformation upon binding to actin in the ADP·Pi state and if the cleft plays a role in the actin-activated Pi and ADP release. Studies in which the dynamics of the actin-binding cleft can be measured in the presence of actin during the product release steps are critical to answering these questions. Myosin V is an actin-based molecular motor that has a long neck, containing six IQ domains, which allows it to move processively along actin (take multiple steps along actin without diffusing away) (12Mehta A.D.

Myosin V also has unique kinetic properties that make it a good candidate to examine actin-dependent conformational changes in myosin (13De La Cruz E.M. Wells A.L. Rosenfeld S.S. Ostap E.M. Sweeney H.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13726-13731Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). First, it has a higher affinity for actin than class II muscle myosins in the weak binding prepower stroke states (14Yengo C.M. De La Cruz E.M. Safer D. Ostap E.M. Sweeney H.L. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 8508-8517Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Second, myosin V has a fast rate of actin-activated phosphate release and a slow rate of ADP release, which allows one to distinguish between conformational changes associated with the two product release steps at fairly low actin concentrations (13De La Cruz E.M. Wells A.L. Rosenfeld S.S. Ostap E.M. Sweeney H.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13726-13731Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar, 15Yengo C.M. Sweeney H.L. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 2605-2612Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Finally, the predominant steady-state intermediate for myosin V is the actomyosin-ADP state (13De La Cruz E.M. Wells A.L. Rosenfeld S.S. Ostap E.M. Sweeney H.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13726-13731Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar, 16De La Cruz E.M. Sweeney H.L. Ostap E.M. Biophys. J. 2000; 79: 1524-1529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), which makes myosin V a good model to examine how myosin can bind both ADP and actin tightly. In the current study, we introduced a tetracysteine motif in the upper 50-kDa region of myosin V, which was labeled with the fluorescein biarscenical hairpin-binding dye (FlAsH) 2The abbreviations used are: FlAsH, fluorescein biarscenical hairpin-binding dye; FRET, fluorescence resonance energy transfer; mant, N-methylanthraniloyl; WT, wild type; TCEP, tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine hydrochloride; MV, myosin V. 2The abbreviations used are: FlAsH, fluorescein biarscenical hairpin-binding dye; FRET, fluorescence resonance energy transfer; mant, N-methylanthraniloyl; WT, wild type; TCEP, tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine hydrochloride; MV, myosin V.

Llopis J. Tsien R.Y. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2002; 124: 6063-6076Crossref PubMed Scopus (750) Google Scholar). We then investigated the structural properties of myosin V labeled with FlAsH and measured the fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) from mant-labeled nucleotides to the FlAsH site on the upper 50-kDa region of myosin V. By characterizing changes in FRET with steady-state and transient kinetic measurements, we demonstrate that the upper 50-kDa region is very sensitive to the presence of actin and that the dynamics of this region may be a critical means of communication between the nucleotide- and actin-binding regions. Reagents—All reagents were the highest purity commercially available. ATP and ADP were prepared fresh from powder. N-Methylanthraniloyl (mant)-labeled 2′-deoxy-ADP and 2′-deoxy-ATP were prepared as described (19Hiratsuka T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 742: 496-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar) or purchased from Jenna Biosciences (Jena, Germany). The mant-ATP and mant-ADP concentrations were determined from absorbance measurements at 255 nm using ∈255 of 23,300 m-1 ·cm-1. ATP and ADP concentrations were determined by absorbance at 259 nm using ∈-259 of 15,400 m-1·cm-. Nucleotides were prepared prior to use in the presence of equimolar MgCl2. Myosin cDNA Construction and Protein Expression and Purification—Site-directed mutagenesis was performed on a construct of chicken myosin V containing a single IQ motif (WT MV 1IQ) (residues 1-792). We substituted residues (positions 292-297) with a tetracysteine motif (Cys-CysPro-Gly-Cys-Cys) to generate the MV 1IQ construct for fluorescent labeling. The baculovirus system was used to express MV 1IQ, which contained a C-terminal Myc tag (EQKLISEEDL) followed by a FLAG tag (DYKD-DDDK) for purification purposes (13De La Cruz E.M. Wells A.L.

The purity was greater than 95% based on Coomassie-stained SDS gels. Myosin concentrations were determined using the Bio-Rad microplate assay using bovine serum albumin as a standard (14Yengo C.M. De La Cruz E.M. Safer D. Ostap E.M. Sweeney H.L. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 8508-8517Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 15Yengo C.M. Sweeney H.L. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 2605-2612Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Actin was purified from rabbit skeletal muscle using an acetone powder method (20Pardee J.D. Spudich J.A. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 85: 164-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (980) Google Scholar). Pyrene actin was generated by labeling actin with pyrene iodoacetamide (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) as described (21Pollard T.D. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 99: 769-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). All experiments were performed in KMg50 TCEP buffer (50 mm KCl, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm MgCl2,1mm TCEP, and 10 mm imidozole-HCl, pH 7.0, 25 °C). Labeling Myosin V 1IQ with FlAsH—A 2.5 μm stock of MV 1IQ, containing the tetracysteine motif and referred to as MV 1IQ hereafter, in KMg50 TCEP was incubated with 10 μm FlAsH for 20 min at room temperature and then left on ice for 12-14 h. The FlAsH-labeled MV 1IQ was then dialyzed for 24 h in KMg50 TCEP to remove the excess dye. The MV 1IQ labeled with FlAsH, referred to as MV 1IQ FlAsH, was examined by SDS-PAGE, using a modified Laemmli buffer (18Adams S.R. Campbell R.E. Gross L.A. Martin B.R. Walkup G.K. Yao Y. Llopis J. Tsien R.Y. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2002; 124: 6063-6076Crossref PubMed Scopus (750) Google Scholar). The extent of labeling of MV 1IQ (unlabeled) was examined by measuring = 63,500 m-1·cm-1 FlAsH by absorbance (∈508m-1·cm-1) and MV 1IQ by the method of Bradford as described above and single turnover measurements. Steady-state ATPase Activity of MV 1IQ—Steady-state ATP hydrolysis by MV 1IQ constructs (50-100 nm) in the absence and presence of actin (0-40 μm) was examined using the NADH-linked assay (13De La Cruz E.M.

In Vitro Motility Assay—Actin filament motility was measured using an in vitro motility assay method described previously (22Kron S.J. Toyoshima Y.Y. Uyeda T.Q. Spudich J.A. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 196: 399-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). Briefly, a 10-μl flow cell was constructed using a nitrocellulose-coated coverslip supported by two strips of double-sided Scotch tape. The myosin was specifically attached to the nitrocellulose-coated surface with an anti-Myc antibody and blocked with bovine serum albumin at a concentration of 1 mg/ml. The motility of F-actin labeled with rhodamine-phalloidin was observed using an activation buffer consisting of KMg50, 3.4 μm calmodulin, and 1 mm ATP. Phosphoenol pyruvate (2.5 mm) and pyruvate kinase (20 units/ml) were added as an ATP regeneration system, and glucose oxidase (0.1 mg/ml), glucose (5 mg/ml), and catalase (0.018 mg/ml) were added to reduce photobleaching. After the addition of the activation buffer, the slide was promptly viewed using an inverted epifluorescent microscope (Olympus 1X70) under × 100 magnification. Real time video images were obtained using a Hamamatsu C8484-05G camera (Hamamatsu Photonics, Hamamatsu, Japan). To measure velocity, the video records were transferred to the Metamorph Imaging System (Universal Imaging Corp., Downingtown, PA). Fluorescence Spectroscopy—A Quantamaster fluorometer (Photon Technology International, Lawrenceville, NJ), equipped with a 75-watt xenon arc lamp as an excitation source and excitation/emission monochrometers, was used to measure steady-state fluorescence of mantlabeled nucleotides and MV 1IQ FlAsH. Mant-labeled nucleotides were excited at 365 nm, and the emission spectra were measured from 400 to 550 nm. FlAsH was excited directly at 495 nm, and the emission was measured from 500 to 600 nm. Steady-state energy transfer measurements were performed by exciting mant-labeled nucleotides at 365 nm, and the emission was measured from 400 to 600 nm. Slit widths were set at a resolution of 2 nm. All fluorescence spectra were corrected for variations in the wavelength sensitivity of the detector system and the presence of Raman scatter and background fluorescence in the appropriate buffer solution. Steady-state anisotropy measurements were taken using excitation and emission Glann Thompson polarizers. Anisotropy was calculated following correction for the G-factor at the appropriate wavelength (24Lakowicz J.R. Principles of Fluorescence Spectroscopy.2nd Ed. Kluwer Academic/Plenum Press, New York1999Crossref Google Scholar). Anisotropy measurements were performed at 25 °C in KMg50 TCEP buffer. In addition, steady-state anisotropy measurements were performed in KMg50 TCEP buffer containing 50% glycerol at -13 °C to estimate the fundamental anisotropy (r0). FRET Measurements—FRET was used to measure the distance between donor fluorophore, mant-labeled nucleotides, and the acceptor fluorophore, FlAsH-labeled MV 1IQ, using the Förester energy transfer theory (23Clegg R.M. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 211: 353-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar, 24Lakowicz J.R. Principles of Fluorescence Spectroscopy.2nd Ed. Kluwer Academic/Plenum Press, New York1999Crossref Google Scholar). The efficiency (E) of energy transfer was measured by examining the increase in the acceptor emission. The efficiency of transfer is given by the following,E=εA(λDex)εD(λDex)FAD(λAcm)FA(λAcm)-11fD(Eq. 1) where FA(λAem) represents the fluorescence intensity at the emission peak of the acceptor in the absence of the donor, FAD(λAem) is the fluorescence intensity from the acceptor in the presence of the donor, corrected by subtracting the fluorescence from unbound mant nucleotides, and ∈a365 and ∈D365 are the extinction coefficients of the acceptor (1259m-1·cm-1) and donor (5304 m-1·cm-1)at 365 nm. The fraction of mant nucleotide bound to myosin (flD) was determined from the dissociation constant, which was measured by fluorescence titration (data not shown). The Förster distance at which energy transfer is equal to 50% (R0) was calculated from Equation 2,R0=((8.79×1023)κ2η-4QDJ(λ))1/6(Eq. 2) where η represents the refractive index of the buffer (η = 1.4), QD is the quantum yield of mant-labeled nucleotides (0.51, 0.46, and 0.46 for mant-ATP bound to MV 1IQ and mant-ADP bound to MV 1IQ and acto-MV, respectively), κ2 is the orientation factor, which ranges from 0 to 4 and is 0.67 when there is free rotation of the donor and acceptor fluorophores, and J is the spectral overlap integral (J = 6.13 ×10-15 cm3·m-1), determined from Equation 3. The quantum yields were determined with a comparative method using mant-ATP alone as a standard (QD = 0.22) (25Yengo C.M. Chrin L.R. Rovner A.S. Berger C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25481-25487Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar).J(λ)=∫εA(λ)·FD(λ)·λ4dλ(Eq. 3) In Equation 3, FD(λ) represents the normalized total integrated intensity of the unquenched donor group, and ∈A is the extinction coefficient of the acceptor. J was numerically integrated at 1-nm intervals, and λ is the wavelength in centimeters. The distance (r) between the donor and acceptor fluorophores was calculated with Equation 4.r=R0((1-E)/E)1/6(Eq. 4) Stopped-flow Measurements and Kinetic Modeling—Transient kinetic experiments were performed in an Applied Photophysics (Surrey, UK) stopped-flow apparatus with a dead time of 1.2 ms. A monochrometer with a 2-nm band pass was used for fluorescence excitation, and cut-off filters were used to measure the emission. All optical filters were provided with the stopped-flow instrument unless otherwise indicated. Pyrene actin and mant-labeled nucleotides were excited at 365 nm, and the emission was measured using a 400-nm long pass filter. FlAsH fluorescence was directly excited at 495 nm or measured by energy transfer from mant-labeled nucleotides by exciting at 365 nm, and the emission was measured with a 515-nm long pass filter. We isolated the mant fluorescence signal in the FRET experiments by using both a 400-nm long pass filter and a 500-nm short pass filter (03SWP406; Melles Griot, Carlsbad, CA). Nonlinear least-squares fitting of the data was done with software provided with the instrument or Kaleidagraph (Synergy Software, Reading, PA). Uncertainties reported are S.E. of the fits unless stated otherwise. Kinetic modeling and simulations were performed with Pro-K software (Applied Photophysics) using the reaction scheme that has been used in recent kinetics studies of myosin V (13De La Cruz E.M.

All concentrations mentioned in the stopped-flow experiments are final concentrations unless stated otherwise. Labeling with FlAsH—Our results demonstrate 1:1 stoichiometric and specific labeling of MV 1IQ, containing the tetracysteine motif, with FlAsH. Fig. 2 demonstrates the labeling of MV 1IQ following SDS-PAGE. The fluorescent myosin heavy chain band from the MV 1IQ construct was compared with WT MV 1IQ incubated for 14 h with FlAsH. The results clearly demonstrate that FlAsH only labeled the MV 1IQ, which contains the tetracysteine motif, and did not bind WT MV 1IQ. The degree of labeling of MV 1IQ FlAsH was measured by determining the FlAsH concentration by absorbance. Bradford assays were used to determine the MV 1IQ concentration, which was verified by single turnover experiments (see below). These results are consistent with the results of Adams et al. (18Adams S.R. Campbell R.E. Gross L.A. Martin B.R. Walkup G.K. Yao Y. Llopis J. Tsien R.Y. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2002; 124: 6063-6076Crossref PubMed Scopus (750) Google Scholar) that demonstrated an affinity of FlAsH for tetracysteine peptides in the picomolar range. Functional Assays—We first measured the ATPase activity of MV 1IQ to determine if introduction of the tetracysteine motif altered the activity of myosin V. The ATPase activity of MV 1IQ (unlabeled) was similar to that of MV 1IQ (WT) (Table 1) (13De La Cruz E.M. Wells A.L. Rosenfeld S.S. Ostap E.M. Sweeney H.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13726-13731Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar) but with a slightly higher Vmax. The steady-state ATPase measurements demonstrate that the MV 1IQ FlAsH has a 2-3-fold reduced maximal rate of ATPase (Vmax) but a similar actin concentration at which the ATPase activity is half-maximal (KATPase) (Fig. 3A and Table 1). There was no difference between the basal ATPase rate of MV 1IQ (unlabeled), MV 1IQ FlAsH, and MV 1IQ WT. In addition, single turnover measurements (data not shown) demonstrated that the ATPase rates in the absence of actin were similar to the basal rates measured in the NADH-coupled assay. Thus, nearly 100% of the purified myosin was active, and the concentration determined by the method of Bradford was validated.TABLE 1Summary of functional assay resultsConstructVoaSteady-state ATPase assay results shown in Fig. 3.

Open table in a new tab To determine if the reduction in the Vmax of MV 1IQ FlAsH was a result of a reduced ADP release rate, we directly examined the rate of ADP release from MV FlAsH in the presence of actin (Fig. 3B). The rate of ADP release, measured by mixing MV 1IQ (0.25 μm) bound to pyrene actin (0.25 μm) and ADP (20 μm) with excess ATP (5 mm), was similar to the Vmax for both) and 1IQ MV 1IQ (unlabeled) (22.2 ± 0.2 s-1 MV FlAsH (8.6 ± 0.2 s -1). Thus, ADP release is probably the rate-limiting step in the ATPase cycle of MV 1IQ (unlabeled) and MV 1IQ FlAsH. The results of the in vitro motility assay demonstrated a 20% reduction in the actin filament velocity generated by MV 1IQ FlAsH compared with MV 1IQ (unlabeled), and MV 1IQ unlabeled was similar to WT MV 1IQ (Table 1). Steady-state Fluorescence—We examined the degree of FRET from mant-ATP or mant-ADP to the FlAsH site upon binding of these fluorescent nucleotides to MV 1IQ FlAsH (Fig. 4, A and B). The enhancement of the FlAsH fluorescence was used to monitor the energy transfer efficiency following subtraction of the contribution of the mant fluorescence (Fig. 4B). In addition, the efficiency of energy transfer (E) was plotted as a function of mant-ATP or mant-ADP and fit to the binding equation, E = (Emax × (mant-ATP/ADP))/(Kd + (mant-ATP/ADP)) (Fig. 5). The FRET efficiency calculated at 100% bound nucleotide (Emax) was higher in the presence of mant-ATP (E = 0.65 ± 0.02) compared with mant-ADP (E = 0.55 ± 0.02). In addition, the degree of energy transfer from mant-ADP to FlAsH in the presence of actin (Emax = 0.61 ± 0.06) was determined. The Kd values from the fits of the data in Fig. 4 were 0.18 ± 0.02, 1.0 ± 0.1, and 1.7 ± 0.4 μm for MV 1IQ (FlAsH) with mant-ATP, mant-ADP, and acto-MV 1IQ (FlAsH) with mant-ADP, respectively.FIGURE 5The efficiency of energy transfer monitored as a function of mant nucleotide concentration.

https://openalex.org/W2040210492,"The Src homology 2 (SH2) domains of the p85 subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3′-kinase have been shown to bind to the tyrosine-phosphorylated platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR). Previously, we have demonstrated that p85 SH2 domains can also bind to the serine/threonine kinase A-Raf via a unique phosphorylation-independent interaction. In this report, we describe a new phosphotyrosine-independent p85 SH2-binding protein, ankyrin 3 (Ank3). In general, ankyrins serve a structural role by binding to both integral membrane proteins at the plasma membrane and spectrin/fodrin proteins of the cytoskeleton. However, smaller isoforms of Ank3 lack the membrane domain and are localized to late endosomes and lysosomes. We found that p85 binds directly to these smaller 120- and 105-kDa Ank3 isoforms. Both the spectrin domain and the regulatory domain of Ank3 are involved in binding to p85. At least two domains of p85 can bind to Ank3, and the interaction involving the p85 C-SH2 domain was found to be phosphotyrosine-independent. Overexpression of the 120- or 105-kDa Ank3 proteins resulted in significantly enhanced PDGFR degradation and a reduced ability to proliferate in response to PDGF. Ank3 overexpression also differentially regulated signaling pathways downstream from the PDGFR. Chloroquine, an inhibitor of lysosomal-mediated degradation pathways, blocked the ability of Ank3 to enhance PDGFR degradation. Immunofluorescence experiments demonstrated that both small Ank3 isoforms colocalized with the lysosomal-associated membrane protein and with p85 and the PDGFR. These results suggest that Ank3 plays an important role in lysosomal-mediated receptor down-regulation, likely through a p85-Ank3 interaction."
https://openalex.org/W2067425615,"Porphobilinogen synthase (PBGS) is an obligate oligomer that can exist in functionally distinct quaternary states of different stoichiometries, which are called morpheeins. The morpheein concept describes an ensemble of quaternary structure isoforms wherein different structures of the monomer dictate different multiplicities of the oligomer (Jaffe, E. K. (2005) Trends Biochem. Sci. 30, 490-497). Human PBGS assembles into long-lived morpheeins and has been shown to be capable of forming either a high activity octamer or a low activity hexamer (Breinig, S., Kervinen, J., Stith, L., Wasson, A. S., Fairman, R., Wlodawer, A., Zdanov, A., and Jaffe, E. K. (2003) Nat. Struct. Biol. 10, 757-763). All PBGS monomers contain an αβ-barrel domain and an N-terminal arm domain. The N-terminal arm structure varies among PBGS morpheeins, and the spatial relationship between the arm and the barrel dictates the different quaternary assemblies. We have analyzed the structures of human PBGS morpheeins for key interactions that would be predicted to affect the oligomeric assembly. Examples of individual mutations that shift assembly of human PBGS away from the native octamer are R240A and W19A. The alternate morpheeins of human PBGS variants R240A and W19A are chromatographically separable from each other and kinetically distinct; their structure and dynamics have been characterized by native gel electrophoresis, dynamic light scattering, and analytical ultracentrifugation. R240A assembles into a metastable hexamer, which can undergo a reversible conversion to the octamer in the presence of substrate. The metastable nature of the R240A hexamer supports the hypothesis that octameric and hexameric morpheeins of PBGS are very close in energy. W19A assembles into a mixture of dimers, which appear to be stable."
https://openalex.org/W1975118243,"Unconventional myosin V takes many 36-nm steps along an actin filament before it dissociates, thus ensuring its ability to move cargo intracellularly over long distances. In the present study we assessed the structural features that affect processive run length by analyzing the properties of chimeras of mouse myosin V and a non-processive class V myosin from yeast (Myo4p) (Reck-Peterson, S. L., Tyska, M. J., Novick, P. J., and Mooseker, M. S. (2001) J. Cell Biol. 153, 1121-1126). Surprisingly a chimera containing the yeast motor domain on the neck and rod of mouse myosin V (Y-MD) showed longer run lengths than mouse wild type at low salt. Run lengths of mouse myosin V showed little salt dependence, whereas those of Y-MD decreased steeply with ionic strength, similar to a chimera containing yeast loop 2 in the mouse myosin V backbone. Loop 2 binds to acidic patches on actin in the weak binding states of the cycle (Volkmann, N., Liu, H., Hazelwood, L., Krementsova, E. B., Lowey, S., Trybus, K. M., and Hanein, D. (2005) Mol. Cell 19, 595-605). Constructs containing yeast loop 2, which has no net charge compared with +6 for wild type, showed a higher Km for actin in steady-state ATPase assays. The results imply that a positively charged loop 2 and a high affinity for actin are important to maintain processivity near physiologic ionic strength. Unconventional myosin V takes many 36-nm steps along an actin filament before it dissociates, thus ensuring its ability to move cargo intracellularly over long distances. In the present study we assessed the structural features that affect processive run length by analyzing the properties of chimeras of mouse myosin V and a non-processive class V myosin from yeast (Myo4p) (Reck-Peterson, S.

Run lengths of mouse myosin V showed little salt dependence, whereas those of Y-MD decreased steeply with ionic strength, similar to a chimera containing yeast loop 2 in the mouse myosin V backbone. Loop 2 binds to acidic patches on actin in the weak binding states of the cycle (Volkmann, N., Liu, H., Hazelwood, L., Krementsova, E. B., Lowey, S., Trybus, K. M., and Hanein, D. (2005) Mol. Cell 19, 595-605). Constructs containing yeast loop 2, which has no net charge compared with +6 for wild type, showed a higher Km for actin in steady-state ATPase assays. The results imply that a positively charged loop 2 and a high affinity for actin are important to maintain processivity near physiologic ionic strength. Unconventional myosin V is an actin-based motor protein involved in organelle and mRNA transport as well as membrane trafficking (for a review, see Ref. 1Reck-Peterson S.L. Provance Jr., D.W. Mooseker M.S. Mercer J.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1496: 36-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Each head of dimeric myosin V consists of a motor domain that binds actin and hydrolyzes ATP followed by an ∼24-nm neck region that binds six calmodulins (CaMs). 3The abbreviations used are: CaM, calmodulin; Y-MD, a chimera containing the motor domain of yeast class V myosin (Myo4p) and the neck and rod of mouse myosin V; Y-Loop2, a chimera containing loop 2 from yeast class V myosin (Myo4p) in the mouse myosin V backbone; WT, mouse wild-type; TIRF, total internal reflection fluorescence; YFP, yellow fluorescent protein; HMM, heavy meromyosin; DTT, dithiothreitol. 3The abbreviations used are: CaM, calmodulin; Y-MD, a chimera containing the motor domain of yeast class V myosin (Myo4p) and the neck and rod of mouse myosin V; Y-Loop2, a chimera containing loop 2 from yeast class V myosin (Myo4p) in the mouse myosin V backbone; WT, mouse wild-type; TIRF, total internal reflection fluorescence; YFP, yellow fluorescent protein; HMM, heavy meromyosin; DTT, dithiothreitol. The coiled-coil rod formed by both heavy chains ends in a globular cargo-binding domain. It has been clearly established that myosin V motors from vertebrates are processive, which allows a single motor to transport cargo, in 36-nm steps, for several micrometers along an actin filament (2Mehta A.D. Rock R.S. Rief M. Spudich J.A. Mooseker M.S. Cheney R.E. Nature. 1999; 400: 590-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (670) Google Scholar).Several kinetic and structural adaptations allow myosin V to be processive. The rate-limiting step for myosin V is ADP release, ensuring that it spends most of its time bound to actin in a strong binding state. In contrast, non-processive myosin II spends most of its ATPase cycle detached from actin in a weak binding state (for a review, see Ref. 3De La Cruz E.M. Ostap E.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2004; 16: 61-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Long processive runs require that there must be communication between the two heads to ensure that at least one head is bound to the actin filament at all times. Recent evidence favors the idea that this coordination is achieved by intramolecular strain between the heads (4Veigel C. Wang F. Bartoo M.L. Sellers J.R. Molloy J.E. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 59-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar, 5Veigel C. Schmitz S. Wang F. Sellers J.R. Nat.

A. 2005; 102: 13873-13878Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Finally it is thought that a high affinity for actin in the weak binding states (ATP and ADP·Pi) is favorable for processivity by helping to maintain actin and myosin in proximity. Myosin V has a substantially stronger affinity for actin in the weak binding states than myosin II (8Yengo C.M. De la Cruz E.M. Safer D. Ostap E.M. Sweeney H.L. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 8508-8517Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). In the widely accepted hand-over-hand mechanism of walking (for a review, see Ref. 9Vale R.D. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 163: 445-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), the rear head detaches upon binding ATP, allowing the attached head to undergo its powerstroke. The detached head then swings forward as it hydrolyzes ATP and finds the next actin binding site via a diffusive search. A high affinity for actin may help ensure that the binding of the new lead head is faster than the rate at which the attached head dissociates from actin, allowing a processive run to continue.Not all class V myosins are processive. A recent kinetic analysis of Drosophila myosin V concluded that it is not a processive motor (10Toth J. Kovacs M. Wang F. Nyitray L. Sellers J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 30594-30603Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The two class V myosins from the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Myo2p and Myo4p) have been reported to be non-processive based on several indirect assays (11Reck-Peterson S.L. Tyska M.J. Novick P.J. Mooseker M.S. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 1121-1126Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Accordingly we engineered and expressed chimeras of processive murine myosin V and non-processive yeast myosin V (Myo4p) to further define the structural and functional features that contribute to processive movement. Surprisingly we showed that the yeast motor domain on the neck and rod of murine myosin V has the potential to drive processive motion to an even greater extent than the wild-type mouse construct. We also showed that the net charge of loop 2, a region implicated in the initial weak interaction between myosin and actin (12Spudich J.A. Nature. 1994; 372: 515-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar, 13Furch M. Geeves M.A. Manstein D.J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 6317-6326Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 14Joel P.B. Sweeney H.L. Trybus K.M. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 9160-9166Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 15Yengo C.M. Sweeney H.L. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 2605-2612Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), affects run lengths by virtue of its ability to strengthen the weak binding steps in the ATPase cycle. We conclude that a myosin optimized for long runs at physiologic ionic strength should have a highly positively charged loop 2.MATERIALS AND METHODSMyosin V Constructs—The constructs described below contained yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) followed by a FLAG epitope (DYKDDDDK) at the C terminus to facilitate purification. Constructs were cloned into pAcSG2 (BD Biosciences) for production of recombinant baculovirus. The wild-type (WT) murine myosin V HMM construct was truncated at amino acid 1098 (16Krementsov D.N. Krementsova E.B. Trybus K.M. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 164: 877-886Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). A yeast motor domain chimera (Y-MD) was created by exchanging yeast Myo4P motor domain into the WT-HMM-YFP backbone. The plasmid pYC352-MYO4 (a gift from Brian Haarer and Karen Beningo) was used as the PCR template for this construct. To exchange motor domains, two XhoI sites in WT-HMM-YFP were ablated, and a new one was engineered at Leu-759/Glu-760. The Myo4p clone was also modified. Myo4p motor domain was cloned into pCR4-TOPO using PCR primers that contained an NcoI site followed by an Ala, 5′-GAACCATGGCATTTGAAGTAGGAACTAAG-3′ (forward), and a XhoI site, 5′-GAGGCTCGAGAAATGCAAGCATTCCTGCTTTAAAG-3′ (reverse). Then an XhoI site at Ala-310 and an NcoI site at Pro-673 sites were ablated (plasmid name, TOPO-MYO4md). Both plasmids (WT and TOPO-MYO4md) were digested with NcoI and XhoI, and the Myo4p motor domain fragment was cloned into the WT backbone. To exchange yeast (Myo4p) loop 2 into the mouse motor domain a SacI site was created at the N terminus of loop 2 and an EcoRI site was created at the C terminus. The Myo4p loop 2 was synthesized by PCR with added SacI and EcoRI sites. The sequence of the region flanking loop 2 was FQD (mouse)-ELRS.. .TLG (yeast)-HQFR (mouse). The boundaries of loop 2 were defined from a sequence alignment of chicken, mouse, and the two yeast class V myosins.Protein Purification of Expressed HMMs—Sf9 cells were infected with recombinant viruses for the heavy chain and for CaM and incubated for ∼72-75 h at 27 °C. CaMΔall, a calmodulin mutant lacking all calcium binding sites, was used to ensure complete occupancy of the IQ motifs. Cells were pelleted and resuspended in 10 mm imidazole, pH 7.4, 0.3 m NaCl, 1 mm EGTA, 2 mm DTT, 25 μg/ml CaMΔall, and protease inhibitors (0.5 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.78 mg/ml benzamidine). The cells were lysed by sonication, and the lysate was centrifuged for 15 min at 250,000 × g in the presence of 2 mm MgATP. Following incubation with FLAG affinity resin (Sigma) for 30 min, the resin was sedimented for 5 min at 1000 rpm and washed with buffer (10 mm imidazole, pH 7.4, 0.3 m NaCl, 1 mm EGTA), and the bound protein was eluted using a 0.1 mg/ml solution of FLAG peptide in the same buffer. Fractions were pooled, concentrated in 50% glycerol, and stored at -20 °C.Preparation of Calmodulin and Actin—CaMΔall, a calmodulin mutant lacking all calcium binding sites (E31Q,E67Q,E104Q,E140Q), was expressed and purified essentially as described previously (16Krementsov D.N. Krementsova E.B. Trybus K.M. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 164: 877-886Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). CaMΔall was cloned into pVL1393 vector for baculovirus expression and into pNew, a pT7-7-based plasmid, for bacterial expression. The cell pellet was resuspended in 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm DTT. After sonication, the solution was clarified for 15 min at 26,000 × g. The supernatant was boiled for 5 min, clarified, and loaded onto a DEAE-Sephacel column (10 ml of resin/0.5-liter culture) equilibrated in buffer A (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT). The column was washed first with buffer A and then with buffer A with 0.1 m NaCl. CaM was eluted with 10 volumes of a linear salt gradient from 100 to 300 mm NaCl. Protein was concentrated and stored in 50% glycerol at -20 °C. Chicken skeletal actin was prepared from acetone powder essentially as described previously (17Pardee J.D. Spudich J.A. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 85: 164-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (967) Google Scholar).Processivity Assay by Single Molecule Total Internal Reflection Fluorescence (TIRF) Microscopy—Single molecule motility assays using TIRF microscopy were performed essentially as described before with the exception that Alexa 660-phalloidin-labeled actin filaments were immobilized onto the cover glass with N-ethylmaleimide-modified myosin instead of via biotin-streptavidin linkage (18Baker J.E. Krementsova E.B. Kennedy G.G. Armstrong A. Trybus K.M. Warshaw D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 5542-5546Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). For all TIRF, motility, and landing rate assays, the myosin V constructs at 0.2 mg/ml were mixed with a 2-fold molar excess of actin and 1 mm MgATP and centrifuged for 20 min at 400,000 × g to remove myosin that was unable to dissociate from actin in the presence of ATP. For TIRF assays, flow cells were first incubated with 0.1 mg/ml N-ethylmaleimide-modified myosin for 2 min, rinsed, incubated with 0.5 μm Alexa 660-phalloidin-labeled actin filaments for 2 min, and then rinsed with Motility Buffer. Motility Buffer contained 25 mm imidazole, pH 7.1, 4 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 10 mm DTT, an oxygen-scavenging system (3 mg/ml glucose, 0.1 mg/ml glucose oxidase, 0.18 mg/ml catalase), an ATP-regenerating system (0.5 mm phosphoenolpyruvate and 100 units/ml pyruvate kinase), 0.1 mg/ml CaMΔall, and varying concentrations of MgATP and KCl. The final assay buffer consisted of Motility Buffer with 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 50 μm MgATP, and 25-100 mm KCl. The ATPase rate of Y-MD is only about half-maximal at 50 μm MgATP, whereas WT and Y-Loop2 are close to maximal at this ATP concentration (data not shown). The myosin V concentration was 0.5-1.0 nm. The assay was performed at room temperature (25 ± 1 °C) on a Nikon TE2000-U microscope equipped with a PlanApo objective lens (×100; numerical aperture, 1.45) for through-the-objective TIRF microscopy. The 488-nm line of an argon laser (Spectra-Physics model 163) was used to excite the YFP-tagged myosin molecules for visualization through a Chroma HQ 560/80 filter (Chroma Technology, Brattleboro, VT). The camera was an image-intensified digital charge-coupled device camera (DVC Intensicam IV S, Austin, TX). The final pixel resolution was 21.5 nm. It was necessary to use a 166-ms exposure time to obtain high quality images of the YFP-labeled myosins. At this setting, the controlling software (QEDInVivo, Media Cybernetics, Inc., Silver Spring, MD) limited the frame rate to 3.4 frames/s.A data set consists of a sequence of images showing single myosin molecules moving processively along actin filaments. The image sequence was processed by a custom program that tracked the movement of each myosin molecule through successive frames. For each run, the program generated a trajectory and calculated the run length (the distance a single myosin travels from its initial attachment to the filament to its dissociation). Each trajectory was then played back and verified manually. We required that each myosin move continuously for at least four frames to qualify as a run. This was necessary to distinguish between directed movement and Brownian motion. With a frame rate of 3.4 frames/s, the total time for each frame is 0.3 s, or 1.2 s for four frames. However, the time interval between the midpoint of four frames is 0.9 s. The shutter is open for 166 ms of the 0.3 s during which time the myosin is moving. The image obtained represents the average position of the myosin during that frame. Velocities are calculated using the time interval between the midpoint of each frame. The final output from the program is a file containing the run length and speed for each trajectory. The run lengths were then combined into a histogram with bin size of 0.2 μm. For WT and Y-Loop2, the minimum bin started at 0.5 μm, whereas for Y-MD the minimum bin started at 0.8 μm. This minimum corresponds approximately to the distance over which each construct moves in four frames, and the minimum bin is higher for Y-MD because it moves with a higher velocity than the other two constructs. The run length distribution histogram was fit withp(x)=Ae-x/λ(Eq. 1) to determine the characteristic run length λ where p(x) is the probability of the myosin traveling a distance x along an actin filament and A is a constant.Our characteristic run lengths for WT are shorter than those reported by Baker et al. (18Baker J.E. Krementsova E.B. Kennedy G.G. Armstrong A. Trybus K.M. Warshaw D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 5542-5546Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) (λ ∼ 1 μm for WT in 25 mm KCl). A major difference is that the earlier data were analyzed by hand, whereas we used an automated tracking program. The automated program tends to result in shorter run lengths because it is better at detecting short runs than humans and because the YFP fluorescence emission occasionally flickers. If the fluorescence intensity flickers in the middle of a run, the tracking program will occasionally count this as two short runs, whereas a human analyzing the data will count this as one long run.In Vitro Motility—Ensemble motility assays were performed essentially as described previously (16Krementsov D.N. Krementsova E.B. Trybus K.M. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 164: 877-886Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). For the standard motility assays, the myosin was diluted to 25 or 50 μg/ml and adsorbed directly to nitrocellulose-coated coverslips that were preincubated with 0.01 mg/ml bovine serum albumin for 30 s (2Mehta A.D. Rock R.S. Rief M. Spudich J.A. Mooseker M.S. Cheney R.E. Nature. 1999; 400: 590-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (670) Google Scholar). The motility assay was performed at 30 °C in Motility Buffer with 25-100 mm KCl and 2 mm MgATP. Filament velocities were calculated using the program described by Work and Warshaw (19Work S.S. Warshaw D.M. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 202: 275-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar).Landing Rates—Actin filament landing rates were used to test the processivity of WT and Y-Loop2 (20Howard J. Hudspeth A.J. Vale R.D. Nature. 1989; 342: 154-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (736) Google Scholar). The landing rate R depends on the myosin density ρ according toR(ρ)=Z(1-e-ρ/ρ0)n(Eq. 2) where n is the number of myosin molecules required to move the actin filament, ρ0 reflects the average surface area over which myosin can interact with an actin filament, and Z depends on the collision rate and the affinity of myosin for actin (21Hancock W.O. Howard J. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 1395-1405Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). An anti-YFP antibody (3E6 mAb, Qbiogene, Inc.) was used to attach the myosin to the nitrocellulose-coated coverslip. The flow cell was prepared by incubating it with 20 μg/ml antibody for 2 min, blocking with 1.0 mg/ml bovine serum albumin for 2 min, and finally incubating with varying concentrations of myosin for 2 min. The landing rate buffer was Motility Buffer with 25 or 100 mm KCl, 2 mm MgATP, 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 40 nm (for WT and Y-Loop2 in 25 mm KCl) or 80 nm (for Y-Loop2 in 100 mm KCl) phalloidin-rhodamine-labeled actin. The labeled actin was sheared by passing it through a 22.5-gauge needle five times. This assay was performed in the TIRF setup described above at 25 ± 1 °C. The rhodamine-labeled actin was excited with the 514-nm line of the argon laser, and the emission filter was a Chroma HQ 575/60. The data were collected at 8 frames/s, and the pixel resolution was 21.5 nm. To qualify as a landing event, an actin filament had to attach to the surface and move smoothly for at least 0.2 μm over at least four frames. The myosin surface density was calculated by assuming that all the myosin bound equally to the top and bottom surfaces and all the adsorbed molecules were fully functional.Landing Rate Analysis—The data were fit to Equation 2. None of the three parameters (Z, ρ0, and n) were fixed; all were determined by the fit. A processive motor by definition should have a value of n = 1, and this has been observed for strongly processive motors such as kinesin and wild type myosin V (2Mehta A.D. Rock R.S. Rief M. Spudich J.A. Mooseker M.S. Cheney R.E. Nature. 1999; 400: 590-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (670) Google Scholar, 21Hancock W.O. Howard J. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 1395-1405Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Our result for Y-Loop2 in 25 mm KCl was n = 2.1, and yet we interpreted this to be a processive motor. The discrepancy lies in the fact that Y-Loop2 is only weakly processive. In the derivation of Equation 2, n is the number of motors attached to the actin filament at any given time. We required that an actin filament move at least 0.2 μm after attaching to the surface to qualify as a landing event to distinguish between real events and diffusion. This is equivalent to 5.6 steps where each step is 36 nm. The characteristic TIRF run length for Y-Loop2 under these conditions was only 0.27 μm (7.5 steps). This implies that close to half of the filaments that actually landed and attached to a single myosin would have detached before reaching the 0.2-μm cutoff, thus reducing the number of events. This effect is most severe at low myosin densities when actin is most likely to be attached to a single myosin, leading to a steeper dependence of the landing rate on myosin density and thus a higher n value. To our knowledge this is the first time a landing rate assay has been performed on a weakly processive motor.Steady-state Actin-activated ATPases—Actin-activated ATPase assays were performed at 37 °C in 10 mm imidazole, pH 7.4, 50 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm EGTA, 2 mm MgATP, and 12 μm exogenous CaMΔall. The buffers also contained an ATP-regenerating system (0.2 mm NADH, 0.5 mm phosphoenolpyruvate, 20 units/ml lactate dehydrogenase, 100 units/ml pyruvate kinase). The rate of the reaction was measured from the decrease in absorbance at 340 nm caused by the oxidation of NADH by lactate dehydrogenase. This assay minimizes the time-dependent ADP-induced inhibition of actin-activated ATPase activity. For each actin concentration, data from three separate assays with at least two different preparations of each construct were combined to find average ATPase rates. Data were then fitted to the Michaelis-Menten equation to obtain the maximum ATPase rate (Vmax) and Km.RESULTSExpressed Constructs—A WT murine myosin V HMM and two chimeric constructs were expressed using the baculovirus/insect cell system (Fig. 1). YFP was cloned at the C terminus of the heavy chain to serve as the fluorophore for single molecule studies. The chimeric constructs Y-MD and Y-Loop2 contained elements of both murine myosin V and Myo4p, the non-processive class V myosin from yeast (11Reck-Peterson S.L. Tyska M.J. Novick P.J. Mooseker M.S. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 1121-1126Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Y-MD contains the entire yeast motor domain, whereas Y-Loop2 contains only loop 2 from yeast. Both chimeras contained the neck and rod of WT-HMM.Maximal Actin-activated ATPase Rate Correlates with Motility—The actin-activated ATPase of the three constructs was determined in 50 mm KCl with an ATP-regenerating system to prevent inhibition by ADP (Fig. 2a). The maximal ATPase rate per head was much higher for Y-MD than for either WT or Y-Loop2 (Vmax values of 26.8 ± 3.1, 12.3 ± 0.5, and 9.5 ± 0.3 s-1, respectively). Loop 2 therefore does not have a substantial effect on the maximal ATPase rate, but it does affect its apparent affinity for actin in the presence of MgATP as assessed by the Km values. The order of apparent affinity for actin was WT-HMM > Y-Loop2 > Y-MD (Km values of 2.8 ± 0.4, 10.0 ± 0.7, and 30.3 ± 5.7 μm, respectively). Although we use Km as a measure of the apparent affinity of actin for myosin, the situation is more complicated for a processive than a non-processive myosin (see “Discussion” for more detail).FIGURE 2ATPase and motility assays. a, actin-activated ATPase assays for WT (red squares), Y-Loop2 (blue circles), and Y-MD (green triangles). Vmax and Km values were 12.3 ± 0.5 s-1 and 2.8 ± 0.4 μm for WT, 9.5 ± 0.3 s-1 and 10.0 ± 0.7 μm for Y-Loop2, and 26.8 ± 3.1 s-1 and 30.3 ± 5.7 μm for Y-MD, respectively. Values are averages ± S.D. of at least three different assays with two different preparations of each construct.

Conditions were as follows: 30 °C, 50 mm KCl, 2 mm MgATP.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)In vitro motility assays were also performed on each construct at 50 mm KCl (Fig. 2b). The actin filament sliding speed of each construct showed the same pattern as the maximal ATPase rate (Table 1). The speeds of WT and Y-Loop2 were nearly identical (0.36 ± 0.03 and 0.38 ± 0.04 μm/s, respectively), whereas Y-MD was much faster (1.41 ± 0.11 μm/s). The maximum actin filament sliding speed of native yeast myosin V (Myo4p) was reported to be 1.1 μm/s (11Reck-Peterson S.L. Tyska M.J. Novick P.J. Mooseker M.S. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 1121-1126Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), similar to the value seen here for Y-MD.TABLE 1Summary of ATPase, motility, and ionic strength dependence of run lengthConstructLoop 2Motor domainVmaxKmSpeed from motilityRun length dependence on ionic strengths-1μMμm/sWTMouseMouse12.3 ± 0.52.8 ± 0.40.36 ± 0.03LowY-Loop2YeastMouse9.5 ± 0.310.0 ± 0.70.38 ± 0.04HighY-MDYeastYeast26.8 ± 3.130.3 ± 5.71.41 ± 0.11High Open table in a new tab Single Molecule Processive Run Lengths—TIRF microscopy was used to directly test the processivity of the three constructs. Actin filaments are bound to a coverslip, and YFP-labeled HMM in solution can attach to the actin filament, move processively along it, then detach, and go back into solution. A typical image sequence of a YFP-HMM moving along a surface-bound actin filament as a function of time is shown in Fig. 3a. Both the run length distribution and the velocity can be calculated from these data. The run length distribution for WT, Y-MD, and Y-Loop2 in 50 mm KCl is shown in Fig. 3b. For each distribution, the solid line shows an exponential fit with a characteristic run length λ, which represents the average length a myosin molecule travels along an actin filament before dissociating.FIGURE 3Single molecule processive runs. a, TIRF microscopy image sequence shows a Y-Loop2 molecule moving processively along an actin filament (filament not visible).

Conditions were as follows: 25 °C, 50 mm KCl, 50 μm MgATP.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Given that yeast Myo4p has been reported to be a non-processive motor (11Reck-Peterson S.L. Tyska M.J. Novick P.J. Mooseker M.S. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 1121-1126Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), we were surprised to observe that Y-MD was processive by this direct assay with a characteristic run length similar to that of WT at 50 mm KCl (λ = 0.35 μm for Y-MD versus λ = 0.38 μm for WT). Y-Loop2 was slightly less processive than WT (λ = 0.28 μm). The processivity of each construct was tested at several KCl concentrations to determine whether this trend persisted (Fig. 4a). The run length for WT was nearly independent of salt concentration from 25 to 100 mm KCl. In contrast, the characteristic run length for both chimeras depended strongly on KCl concentration. Y-MD had longer characteristic run lengths than WT at low salt concentrations but shorter run lengths at high KCl. Y-Loop2 was processive at low ionic strength with run lengths gradually decreasing with ionic strength until it was non-processive in 100 mm KCl. The feature common to Y-Loop2 and Y-MD is the yeast loop 2 sequence, implying that this region is responsible for their similar ionic strength dependence.FIGURE 4Processive run lengths and velocities from single molecule data. a, the characteristic run length from the TIRF microscopy assay for WT (red squares), Y-Loop2 (blue circles), and Y-MD (green triangles) as a function of KCl concentration. b, speed of single myosin Vs during a processive run as a function of KCl concentration. Symbols are the same as in a. The velocity and run length for Y-Loop2 in 100 mm KCl were not determined because the construct was not processive under these conditions.

Accordingly, CGCs die by apoptosis when cultured in physiological KCl concentrations (5 mm; K5), and they survive in the presence of depolarizing conditions such as high KCl concentration (25 mm; K25) or N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA). We have recently shown that NMDA is able to exert a long lasting neuroprotective effect when added to immature (2 days in vitro) CGC cultures by inhibition of caspase-3 activity. Here we show that NMDA- and K25-mediated neuroprotection is associated with an increase in the levels of Bcl-2, an inhibition of K5-mediated increase in Bax, and the inhibition of the release of apoptogenic factors from mitochondria such as Smac/DIABLO and cytochrome c. Moreover, we have shown that similar effects are observed when c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNKs) are inhibited and that treatment of CGC cultures with NMDA blocks K5-mediated JNK activation. These results allow us to postulate that the inhibition of JNK-mediated release of apoptogenic factors from mitochondria is involved in the NMDA protection from K5-mediated apoptosis of CGCs.

In vivo apoptotic death could be mimicked in vitro by culturing CGCs in a low potassium (5 mm; K5) medium (3Gallo V. Kingsbury A. Balázs R. Jorgensen O.S. J. Neurosci. 1987; 7: 2203-2213Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). By contrast, CGCs survive when cultured in the presence of depolarizing concentrations of KCl (25 mm; K25) or the glutamate receptor agonist N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA), mainly by a calcium-dependent mechanism (3Gallo V.

The signaling pathways leading to CGC apoptosis by KCl deprivation and the mechanisms involved in neuroprotection by depolarization or extracellular factors are still poorly known.

Accordingly, the release of cytochrome c and apoptosis-inducing factor from mitochondria into the cytosol of KCl-deprived CGCs has been described (10Wigdal S.S. Kirkland R.A. Franklin J.L.

Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 61-66Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (811) Google Scholar). It is known that these cells are dependent upon Bax to execute cell death mediated by KCl deprivation (14Miller T.M. Moulder K.L. Knudson C.M. Creedon D.J. Deshmukh M. Korsmeyer S.J. Johnson Jr., E.M. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 205-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar), although a decrease in Bax expression has also been reported (11Alavez S. Pedroza D. Moran J. Neurochem. Int. 2003; 43: 581-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Moreover, it is not clear whether the expression of the antiapoptotic protein Bcl-2 changes in KCl-deprived CGCs (11Alavez S. Pedroza D. Moran J. Neurochem.

Raingeaud J. Davis R.J. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1995; 270: 1326-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (5034) Google Scholar). Changes in mitochondrial transmembrane potential and subsequent caspase-3 activation observed in KCl-deprived CGCs are preceded by an increase in active c-Jun (17Watson A. Eilers A. Lallemand D. Kyriakis J. Rubin L.L. Ham J. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 751-762Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although c-Jun is a substrate of JNKs, the participation of these kinases in KCl deprivation-mediated apoptosis of CGCs remains unclear. Pharmacological inhibition of JNKs seems to reduce apoptosis in CGC cultures (18Harris C. Maroney A.C. Johnson Jr., E.M. J. Neurochem. 2002; 83: 992-1001Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 19Cao J. Semenova M.M. Solovyan V.T. Han J. Coffey E.T. Courtney M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 35903-35913Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). However, no increase in overall JNK activity was detected in KCl-deprived CGCs cultures (17Watson A. Eilers A. Lallemand D. Kyriakis J. Rubin L.L. Ham J. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 751-762Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), in contrast with the increase observed when CGCs apoptosis was triggered by other stimuli (20Shimoke K. Yamagishi S. Yamada M. Ikeuchi T.

We have recently shown that NMDA protects CGCs from K5-mediated apoptosis by blocking the increase in caspase-3 activity caused by KCl deprivation (22Xifrò X. Malagelada C. Migñano A. Rodriguez-Alvarez J. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2005; 21: 827-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). However, it is not known whether the NMDA antiapoptotic effect is affecting the release of proapoptotic proteins from mitochondria or the activation of JNK kinases. In this study, we show that the antiapoptotic effect of NMDA is mediated by inhibition of K5-mediated JNKs phosphorylation, an increase in Bcl-2 levels, a decrease in Bax levels, and the inhibition of Smac/DIABLO release to cytosol.

All other chemicals were obtained from Sigma or Calbiochem. Cell Culture—Granule cell cultures were prepared from dissociated cerebella of 8-day-old Wistar rats as previously described by Balazs et al.(4Balazs R. Jorgensen O.S. Hack N. Neuroscience. 1988; 27: 437-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). Cells were plated (8 × 105 cells/cm2) in basal medium Eagle containing 5 mm (K5) or 25 mm (K25) KCl supplemented with 10% heatinactivated fetal calf serum, 0.6% glucose, 2 mm l-glutamine, 25,000 units of penicillin, and 25 mg of streptomycin. 10 μm cytosine-β-d-arabinofuranoside was added to the cultures 20 h after plating to prevent the proliferation of nonneuronal cells. Neurons were plated on 24-well plates for measurement of cell viability and mitochondrial membrane potential, on 100-mm culture dishes for RNA extraction, on 60-mm culture dishes for measurement of caspase activity, and on 35-mm culture dishes for Western blotting analysis, immunocytochemistry, and observation of mitochondrial activity. We added 100 μm of NMDA or 20 mm KCl at 2 DIV to K5-containing culture medium to promote the survival of CGCs. In some experiments, the SP600125 was added 30 min before the addition of NMDA or KCl. The procedures followed were in accordance with guidelines of the Comissió d'Ètica en l'Experimentació Animal i Humana of the Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona and according to recommendations of the French Ethical Committee. Cell Viability—Quantification of neuronal survival was assessed by a fluorescein diacetate assay. At 7 DIV, cells were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and then incubated for 15 min with 7.5 μg/ml fluorescein diacetate, rinsed with PBS, and lysed with a Tris-HCl/SDS solution. Fluorescence intensity was measured with an FL600 fluorescence microplate reader (Bio-Tek Instruments). Data are mean ± S.E. of values obtained from four independent experiments performed in triplicate. Subcellular Fractionation—Cerebellar granule cells were washed once in PBS and harvested in isotonic buffer (250 mm sucrose, 1 mm EDTA, and 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4) supplemented with 0.25 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin. After a brief sonication, samples were transferred to 1.5-ml tubes and centrifuged at 900 × g for 10 min at 4 °C to eliminate nuclei and unbroken cells. Supernatant was then centrifuged at 9,500 × g for 15 min at 4 °C to obtain the heavy membrane pellet enriched for mitochondria, and the resulting supernatant was stored as the cytosolic fraction. Western Blotting—Cells were washed once with PBS, and total cellular proteins were extracted by incubating neurons in lysis buffer containing 1% Triton X-100, 50 mm Tris-HCl, and 10 mm EDTA. The homogenate was centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C, and the proteins contained in the supernatant were precipitated by the addition of ice-cold 10% trichloroacetic acid overnight. Protein extract was centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C and washed three times with alcohol/ether (30:70). The pellet was denatured in 62.5 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 2% (w/v) SDS, 10% glycerol, 140 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 0.1% (w/v) bromphenol blue at 100 °C for 5 min. Proteins were resolved on 10% SDS-PAGE for detection of phospho-JNK, JNK, phospho-c-Jun, c-Jun, Smac, and XIAP. 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels were used for detection of Bax, Bcl-2, caspase-3, and cytochrome c. After separation, proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. The membranes were washed with TBS-Tween (Tris-buffered saline with 0.1% of Tween) and incubated with blocking buffer (5% bovine serum albumin in TBS-Tween) for 1 h at room temperature to block nonspecific binding. The blots were washed and incubated overnight at 4 °C with the primary antibodies diluted (1:500 for Bax, Bcl-2, caspase-3, cytochrome c, phospho-c-Jun, Smac, and JNK; 1:1000 for β-tubulin, Hsp60, c-Jun, and XIAP; 1:5000 for phospho-JNK) in blocking buffer. Blots were then washed with TBS-Tween and incubated for 1 h at room temperature with an anti-rabbit IgG polyclonal antibody for detection of Bax, Bcl-2, caspase-3, phospho-c-Jun, phospho-JNK, and JNK; anti-mouse IgG polyclonal antibody for detection of β-tubulin, c-Jun, cytochrome c, XIAP, and Hsp60; and anti-goat IgG antibody for detection of Smac. All secondary antibodies were diluted in blocking buffer at 1:1000. Immunoreactive bands were visualized using an enhanced chemiluminescence method and quantified by a computer-assisted densitometer. Bax, Bcl-2, and XIAP levels were normalized with their corresponding β-tubulin counterparts and represented as a percentage versus control (100%). Phospho-JNK and phospho-c-Jun levels were normalized with total JNK or c-Jun and also represented as percentage versus control. Cytochrome c and Smac/DIABLO levels were represented as ratios between the levels in mitochondria versus cytosol. Data are always expressed as the mean ± S.E. of values obtained at least in three independent experiments performed in duplicate. Immunoprecipitation—Cells were washed twice with PBS and lysed in a Triton X-100-based lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 10 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 25 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Cell lysates containing 1 mg of protein were incubated with 1 μg of mouse anti-XIAP antibody at 4 °C overnight, and the immune complex was sequestered by the addition of protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences), followed by incubation for 1 h at 4 °C. The resulting immobilized immune complex was pelleted by centrifugation at 300 rpm for 2 min at 4 °C and washed three times with lysis buffer. The pellet was denatured in 62.5 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 2% (w/v) SDS, 10% glycerol, 33 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.1% (w/v) bromphenol blue at 95 °C for 5 min. Proteins were resolved on 12% SDS-PAGE for detection of XIAP and caspase-3 by Western blotting as previously indicated. Immunocytochemistry—Neurons were incubated from 1 to 12 h in the absence or presence of NMDA (100 μm) or K25. Then CGC cultures were washed with PBS and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (w/v in PBS) for 10 min at room temperature. Afterward, they were washed twice with PBS, blocked with 5% fetal calf serum and 3% bovine serum albumin in PBS (blocking buffer), and then incubated overnight at 4 °C with antibody against the active form of caspase-9 (1:100 dilution in blocking buffer). Cultures were then thoroughly washed with PBS and incubated with a fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary antibody (1:500 dilution) in blocking buffer for 1 h at room temperature. After several washes, the wells and gasket were removed from the slides and mounted under glass coverslips with DAKO. Fluorescence was visualized under a LEICA microscope. Three independent experiments were performed in duplicate. Caspase Activity—CGCs were incubated for different times in the absence or presence of NMDA (100 μm) or K25. Cells were washed twice with PBS at 37 °C, resuspended in PBS at 4 °C, and harvested by centrifugation at 350 × g for 9 min at 4 °C. Treatment of cellular pellet and incubation with caspase-9 pseudosubstrate LEHD-7-amido-4-(trifluoromethyl) coumarin or caspase-3 pseudosubstrate benzyloxycarbonyl-DEVD-R110 were done according to the protocol suggested by the manufacturer. Fluorescence intensity was measured with the microplate reader (Bio-Tek FL600). Data are mean ± S.E. of the values obtained in four independent experiments performed in triplicate. Measurement of Mitochondrial Transmembrane Potential—Mitochondrial transmembrane potential (Ψm) was analyzed using the carbocyanine dye, JC1. When membrane potential is intact, the dye JC-1 can enter into mitochondria, where it concentrates, accumulates, and aggregates, producing an intense red emission. In cells where the mitochondrial membrane potential is altered, the monomeric form of JC-1 remains cytosolic, and it emits a green signal. At 2 DIV, cultured CGCs were treated for 6-12 h in the absence or presence of NMDA (100 μm) or K25 and in the absence or presence of SP600125 (added 30 min before the treatment with NMDA or K25). The cells were rinsed with PBS at 37 °C, incubated with 7.5 μg/ml JC-1 for 15 min, and washed twice with PBS. The ratio of fluorescence emissions at 590 nm (red) versus 530 nm (green) was measured with the microplate reader (Bio-Tek FL600). This ratio represents the amount of aggregates (red) divided by the amount of monomeric JC-1 molecules (green) and is an index of the mitochondrial transmembrane potential. Data represent arbitrary units and were expressed as the mean ± S.E. of values obtained in three independent experiments performed in triplicate. Changes in mitochondrial membrane potential were also monitored by epifluorescence under a Leica microscope. RT-PCR—Cells were harvested for total RNA using the RNAeasy Mini kit from Qiagen following the manufacturer's instructions. Contaminating DNA was removed by treatment with the RNase-free DNase set from Qiagen. Total RNA (1 μg) was reverse transcribed using the SuperScript First-Strand Synthesis System for RT-PCR (Invitrogen). To study bax and bcl-2 RNA levels, real time quantitative PCR analyses were performed in real time using 1× Mastermix (Applied Biosystems) containing preset concentrations of dNTPs, MgCl2, and the SYBR green reporter dye along with 100 nm forward and reverse primers and either 100 nm SYBR green reporter dye, using the Taq-Man 7000 sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems). RNA levels were deduced by comparison of cDNA-generated signals in samples with signals generated by a standard curve constructed with known amounts of cDNA and internally corrected with the 18 S cDNA amplification. The rat Bax primer set was as follows: forward primer, 5′-GACAACAACATGGMGCT-3′; reverse primer, 5′ AGCCCATGATGGTTCTGATC-3′. The human Bcl-2 primer set was as follows: forward primer, 5′-CCGCATCAGGAAGGCTAGAG-3′; reverse primer, 5′-CTGGGACACAGGCAGGTTCT. The human 18S primer set was as follows: forward primer, 5′GTGGAGCGATTTGTCTGGTT-3′; reverse primer, 5′-CGCTGAGCCAGTCAGTGTAG-3′. Data represent-fold changes versus K5 and represent the mean ± S.E. of values obtained in four independent experiments. XIAP mRNA and rRNA 18 S levels were determined by RT-PCR, and the products were electrophoresed on 1% agarose gels and stained with ethidium bromide. DNA size markers (Invitrogen) were run in parallel to validate the predicted sizes of the amplified bands (795 bp for XIAP and 350 bp for 18 S). The PCR products were normalized to the amplified 18 S, the internal reference gene. The rat cdc-RIAP3 primer set was as follows: forward primer, 5′-TGAAGAAGCCAGACCGAAGA-3′; reverse primer, 5′-TGACTTGACTCATCCTGCGA-3′. The rat 18S primer set was as follows: forward primer, 5′-TCAAGAACGAAAGTCGGAGG-3′; reverse primer, 5′-GGACATCTAAGGGCATCACA-3′. Gene expression was visualized in three independent experiments. Statistical Analysis—Statistical significance was determined by oneway analysis of variance followed by Tukey's multiple comparison test. A value of p < 0.05 was accepted as denoting statistical significance. NMDA and K25 Reduce the K5-mediated Loss of Mitochondrial Activity in Cerebellar Granule Cells—Previous results in our laboratory have indicated that a 24-h exposure to NMDA or K25 was able to exert a long lasting neuroprotective effect on immature CGCs (2 DIV) when cultured in K5 (22Xifrò X. Malagelada C. Migñano A. Rodriguez-Alvarez J. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2005; 21: 827-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Since it has been described that potassium deprivation of mature CGCs cultures induced a reduction in ΔΨm (10Wigdal S.S. Kirkland R.A. Franklin J.L. Haak-Frendscho M. J. Neurochem. 2002; 82: 1029-1038Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 15Tanabe H. Eguchi Y. Shimizu S. Martinou J.C. Tsujimoto Y. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1998; 10: 1403-1411Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), we decided to explore the effect of NMDA or K25 on ΔΨm in immature CGC cultures by using the JC-1 red/green ratio. CGCs cultured in K5 presented a 20% reduction in ΔΨm versus control cells (cells grown in K25 from seeding). Treatment at 2 DIV with NMDA for 12 h reduced by 50% the loss of mitochondrial activity caused by K5. Moreover, treatment with K25 at 2 DIV for 12 h was able to prevent completely the K5-mediated reduction of ΔΨm (Fig. 1). NMDA and K25 Prevent the K5-mediated Induction of bax and Increase the Expression of bcl-2—Two members of the Bcl-2 family seem to have an important role in controlling the state of ΔΨm and the decision to enter apoptosis: Bax, a proapoptotic member of the Bcl-2 family, and Bcl-2, an antiapoptotic member. These two Bcl-2 family members modulate apoptotic cell death through Bax homodimers (induction of apoptosis) or Bax-Bcl-2 heterodimers (antiapoptotic role). In this context, we wanted to explore whether the prevention of K5-mediated reduction of ΔΨm and K5-mediated apoptosis by K25 and NMDA was correlated with changes in Bax and Bcl-2 levels. For this purpose, we studied both bax and bcl-2 mRNA expression levels by RT-PCR and protein levels by Western blot in each condition. CGCs cultured in K5 medium present a 2-fold increase in bax mRNA at 2 DIV when compared with control cultures (CT; cells grown in K25; Fig. 2A). By contrast, no differences were observed in bcl-2 mRNA levels (Fig. 3A). Similar results were observed when protein levels were determined by Western blotting (Figs. 2B and 3B). The addition of NMDA at 2 DIV was able to block K5-mediated increase of bax mRNA levels in a time-dependent manner. A complete inhibition of K5-mediated bax mRNA level increase was observed until 4 h after NMDA treatment (Fig. 2A). No differences in bax mRNA levels with K5 cultures were observed after 6 h (Fig. 2A and data not show). The reduction in bax mRNA by NMDA was also accompanied by a reduction in Bax protein levels (Fig. 2B). Similarly, K25 was also able to block K5-mediated increase in bax mRNA and protein levels (Fig. 2C).FIGURE 3NMDA and K25 increase the levels of Bcl-2 mRNA and protein. A, the level of Bcl-2 mRNA was determined by RT-PCR in CGCs cultured in K5 and exposed to NMDA (100 μm) or K25 at 2 DIV from 1 to 6 h, with the exception of controls (CT), where CGCs were plated in K25. Results represent arbitrary units versus controls and are the mean ± S.E. of four independent experiments. B and C, Neurons grown in K5 were treated with NMDA (100 μm) or K25 at 2 DIV from 30 min to 6 h. Protein levels of Bcl-2 and β-tubulin were determined by Western blotting. Cultures grown in K25 were used as control cultures. Representative Western blots are shown. Data represent the ratio between Bcl-2 and β-tubulin levels. Results are shown as percentage versus controls and are the mean ± S.E. of values obtained in three independent experiments performed in duplicate. The asterisks indicate significant difference from K5 (*, p < 0.05).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Next, we analyzed whether NMDA or K25 could change bcl-2 mRNA and protein levels. Both NMDA and K25 were able to increase bcl-2 mRNA levels (2.5- and 2-fold respectively) but only during the first 1 h of treatment (Fig. 3A). Accordingly, an increase in Bcl-2 protein levels by NMDA or K25 (92 and 55%, respectively, versus CGCs cultured in K5 for 1 h) was observed by Western blotting. NMDA and K25 Block the K5-mediated Release of the Mitochondrial Apoptotic Factors Cytochrome c and Smac/DIABLO—Caspase activation during apoptosis is often controlled by the release of mitochondrial proapoptotic factors, such as cytochrome c or Smac/DIABLO. Since previous work in our laboratory (22Xifrò X. Malagelada C. Migñano A. Rodriguez-Alvarez J. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2005; 21: 827-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) has shown that NMDA and K25 are able to reduce K5-mediated caspase-3 activation, we investigated whether this effect could be related to the modulation of cytochrome c or Smac/DIABLO release from mitochondria. For this purpose, we quantified the expression level of both proteins by Western blot in mitochondria and cytosolic fraction obtained from K5-, K25-, or NMDA-treated CGC cultures. The purity of the mitochondrial fractions was confirmed by reprobing the blots with an antibody against mitochondria-specific Hsp60 protein (Fig. 4A). CGCs cultured in K5 for 2 DIV presented lower levels of cytochrome c in the mitochondria than in the cytosol. The observed mitochondria/cytosol ratio was around 0.5 in K5 cultures, which is 4 times lower that the observed ratio in control cultures (Fig. 4A). However, when NMDA or K25 was added at 2 DIV, an inhibition of cytochrome c release from mitochondria was observed after 6 h. It is well known that cytosolic cytochrome c can interact with Apaf-1 (apoptosis protease-activating factor-1) and procaspase-9 to form a complex, called apoptosome, that activates caspase-9 (23Zou H. Li Y. Liu X. Wang X. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11549-11556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1796) Google Scholar). Accordingly, we decided to check whether the release of mitochondrial cytochrome c in K5 CGCs cultures was associated with caspase-9 activation. Surprisingly, neither the determination of caspase-9 activity nor the use of an antibody against the active fragment of caspase-9 indicated that caspase-9 was active in K5-cultured CGCs (Fig. 4B). No activation was also observed in NMDA- and K25-treated cultures. By contrast, staurosporine was able to activate caspase-9, as previously described (24Wu G. Chai J. Suber T.L. Wu J. Du C. Wang X. Shi Y. Nature. 2000; 408: 1008-1012Crossref PubMed Scopus (709) Google Scholar). On the other hand, we have also observed by Western blot the presence of the mitochondrial protein Smac/DIABLO in the cytosol of K5-cultured CGCs at 2 DIV. By contrast, no Smac/DIABLO was detected in the cytosol of control cultures (Fig. 5). Accordingly, the observed ratio between mitochondria and cytosol was 6.4 in control cultures and 1.1 in K5-cultured CGCs (Fig. 5). The presence of Smac/DIABLO in the cytosol of K5 cultures was abolished after 6 h of treatment with NMDA or K25 (Fig. 5 and data not shown). Incubation with NMDA or K25 for shorter times did not prevent the K5-mediated release of Smac/DIABLO (data not shown). NMDA and K25 Increase the Levels of X-linked IAP and Its Interaction with Caspase-3—Cytosolic Smac/DIABLO promotes caspases activation by inhibiting the interaction between the caspases and the IAPs (24Wu G. Chai J. Suber T.L. Wu J. Du C. Wang X. Shi Y. Nature. 2000; 408: 1008-1012Crossref PubMed Scopus (709) Google Scholar). Since NMDA blocks K5-mediated release of Smac/DIABLO, we wanted to explore the eventual role of XIAP function in NMDA-mediated inhibition of caspase-3 (22Xifrò X. Malagelada C. Migñano A. Rodriguez-Alvarez J. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2005; 21: 827-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). CGCs cultured in K5 for 2 DIV, which we have shown that release Smac/DIABLO from mitochondria (Fig. 5), presented lower levels of XIAP than neurons grown in K25 (CT; Fig. 6A). The addition of NMDA at 2 DIV induced an increase in XIAP levels, which was already evident at 4 h (Fig. 6A). Maximal increase in XIAP levels was observed 8 h after the NMDA addition (250% versus K5). Similar results were observed in K25-treated cultures (Fig. 6A). This increase in XIAP protein levels was not due to an increase of XIAP mRNA (Fig. 6B). The decrease in cytosolic Smac/DIABLO and the increase in XIAP levels observe"

Between nga and slo, a putative open reading frame (orf1) is located whose function has been totally unknown. Present investigation demonstrated that the orf1 encodes a protein designated as streptococcal NADase inhibitor (SNI). From its nucleotide sequence, SNI was inferred to comprise 161 amino acid residues and the deduced molecular weight was 18,800. This protein was detectable only within cells. Coexpression of SNI was essential for production of streptococcal NADase, and NADase precursor existed as an inactive complex with SNI, in recombinant Escherichia coli. Monomeric NADase and SNI rapidly formed in vitro a stable heterodimer complex in the ratio 1:1, resulting in complete suppression of the hydrolase activity. Unlike other bacterial NADase inhibitors, SNI was thermostable. This protein, coexpressed and complexed with NADase, may protect the producer cocci from exhaustion of NAD.

Streptolysin O (SLO), an oxygen-labile cholesterol-dependent cytolysin, is an extracellular protein produced by most strains of GAS and many strains of GCS and GGS (4Tiesler E. Trinks C. Zentralbl. Bakteriol. Mikrobiol. Hyg. [A]. 1982; 253: 81-87PubMed Google Scholar). SLO belongs to a single, highly homologous family of cytolysins found in species of five genera: Streptococcus, Bacillus, Clostridium, Listeria, and Arcanobacterium (5Alouf J.E. Pharmacol.

Cell. 2001; 104: 143-152Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar) proposed, for the first time from Gram-positive bacteria, a cytolysin-mediated translocation system that is a functional equivalent to the type III secretion system in Gram-negative bacteria (12Buttner D.

Their data support a model in which the effector NAD-glycohydrolase (NADase), encoded by nga (spn) located upstream of the slo gene, is transported through the SLO pore into the host cell (11Madden J.C. Ruiz N. Caparon M. Cell. 2001; 104: 143-152Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Thus SLO is of considerable biochemical and clinical interest, and elucidation of expression mechanism of slo gene is important for understanding streptococcal pathogenesis as well. Recently, we demonstrated that slo is a member of an operon covering the upper-stream nusG and nga genes (nusG-nga-orf1-slo), from which transcription of slo proceeds polycistronically, and major transcript is produced by readthrough from nga promoter (16Kimoto H. Fujii Y. Yokota Y. Taketo A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1681: 134-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar).

A data base search indicated that Orf1 was conserved in a group A Streptococcus (GAS) strain pyogenes as well but missing in other bacterial species. The present report describes molecular characterization of the Orf1 protein. Materials—Mutanolysin and lysozyme were purchased from Sigma. Ampicillin sodium and l -arabinose were obtained from Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd. (Osaka, Japan). DNA modification and restriction enzymes were products from Takara Shuzo Co., Ltd. (Kyoto, Japan), Toyobo Co., Ltd. (Osaka, Japan), or Nippon gene (Toyama, Japan). Protein molecular standards were obtained from Bio-Rad and Amersham Biosciences. Yeast extract and Tryptone were purchased from Difco Laboratories (Detroit, MI). Horseradish-peroxidase-conjugated nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid was obtained from Qiagen (Hilden, Germany). All other chemicals were reagent grade or molecular biological grade. Bacterial Strains and Culture Conditions—Streptococcus dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis H46A (36Christensen L.R. J. Gen. Physiol. 1945; 28: 363-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) was grown in Todd Hewitt broth (BD Biosciences) supplemented with 1% yeast extract (THY medium, Todd Hewitt broth supplemented with 1% yeast extract), at 37 °C. E. coli TOP10 (Invitrogen) and E. coli BL21 (Novagen, Madison, WI) were used as the cloning hosts for recombinant plasmids. These strains were cultured in Luria-Bertani broth (LB) at 37 °C. E. coli TOP10 is capable of transporting l -arabinose, but not metabolizing it. Electroporation was used for introduction of plasmid DNA into E. coli TOP10 and BL21 (37Kimoto H. Taketo A. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1997; 122: 237-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Transformants were selected on LB plates containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin. PCR—Expand High Fidelity PLUS PCR System was a product from Roche Diagnostics (Penzberg, Germany). Enzymes and buffers were used according to suppliers' recommendation. The total volume of the PCR mixtures was mostly 50 μl. Usually, 40 cycles of amplification were carried out, under the conditions of initial denaturation (90 s at 94 °C), strand denaturation (30 s at 94 °C), annealing (30 s at 55 °C), and elongation (60 s per kb at 72 °C). DNA Manipulations—Plasmid DNAs of E. coli TOP10 were extracted using the QIAprep Spin Miniprep Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Genomic DNA of streptococci for PCR was prepared as described previously (16Kimoto H. Fujii Y. Yokota Y. Taketo A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1681: 134-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Plasmids and Synthetic Oligonucleotide Primers—Plasmid pBAD/His series, for strict control of gene expression and fusion with His tag, was purchased from Invitrogen (Groningen, The Netherlands). The nga- orf1 region of the nga-orf1-slo operon was amplified from chromosomal DNA of S. dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis H46A by PCR, using the following oligonucleotide primers: primer 1: 5′-CGGGATCCGTTAGTGGCAAAGAAGGTAAAAAAAGCG-3′ (underlined BamHI site was followed by the sequence encoding the amino-terminal of the mature-type NADase) and primer 2: 5′-GGGGTACCCTAAAATGTTTCTATTGTTCTTTCGAC-3′ (underlined KpnI site was followed by the stop codon and then by the sequence encoding the carboxyl-terminal of Orf1). The PCR product was then digested with BamHI and KpnI, and ligated with pBAD/His B pretreated with BglII and KpnI, to yield plasmid pBAD/His I (Fig. 1A). Similarly, the nga region of the nga-orf1-slo operon was amplified using primer 1 and primer 3: 5′-GGGGTACCTTACTTCCTATCTTGCATTTTCTTAATTTTG-3′ (underlined KpnI site was followed by stop codon and then by the carboxyl-terminal-encoding sequence), and ligated with pBAD/His B, yielding plasmid pBAD/His II (Fig. 1A). Plasmid pQE30 was purchased from Qiagen (Hilden, Germany). The orf1 region of the nga-orf1-slo operon was amplified from chromosomal DNA of S. dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis H46A by PCR, using primer 4: 5′-CGGGATCCTATAAGGTGCCAAAGGGTTTAGAAC-3′(underlined BamHI site was followed by the codon directing the second residue of the amino-terminal of Orf1; the first residue was from pBAD/His), and primer 2. The PCR product was then digested with BamHI and KpnI, and ligated with pQE30 pretreated with BamHI and KpnI, to produce 6 consecutive histidine tag-fused Orf1. DNA Sequencing and Sequence Data Analysis—The nucleotide sequence was determined by the dideoxy method using appropriate primers, with ABI PRISM™ 3100 genetic analyzer (PE Applied Biosystems). The nucleotide sequence data were analyzed using GENETYX computer software (Software development Co. Ltd., Tokyo, Japan). The chromosomal DNA sequence data base was searched using BLASTN search algorithms (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST/). SDS-PAGE—SDS-PAGE of the enzyme was carried out by the method of Laemmli (38Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207227) Google Scholar) under reduced condition. Protein bands were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250. To prepare whole cell lysate of E. coli, 0.5 ml of cultures was centrifuged for 3 min (16,000 × g, 4 °C), and the resulting bacterial pellets were lysed with 0.1 ml of 1× sample buffer (composed of 1% SDS, 1% 2-mercaptoethanol, 20% glycerol, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8), and the lysate was incubated at 100 °C for 3 min. The remaining bacterial particles and non-lysed cells were removed by centrifugation for 5 min (16,000 × g, room temperature). Similarly, 5 ml of S. dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis H46A culture was centrifuged for 15 min (4,000 × g, 4 °C), and the resulting bacterial pellet was incubated for 30 min at 37 °C in a lysis solution (composed of 100 units/ml mutanolysin, 10 mg/ml lysozyme, 50 mm glucose, 10 mm EDTA, 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0). After incubation, the cells were collected by centrifugation at 4,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C, and the pellet was suspended in 0.1 ml of ultrapure water. Then, 0.1 ml of 2× sample buffer was added, and the suspension was incubated at 100 °C for 3 min. The remaining bacterial particles and non-lysed cells were removed by centrifugation for 5 min (16,000 × g, room temperature). NH2-terminal Amino Acid Sequence—The intact Orf1 (mature-type without His tag) overexpressed in E. coli BL21 and highly purified intact Orf1 from S. dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis H46A were subjected to 12.5 and 15% SDS-PAGE, and transferred to PVDF membrane. The PVDF membranes were stained by Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 and protein bands with 19 kDa were cut out from the membrane. Protein sequencing of the two bands was performed by automated Edman degradation with a PE Applied Biosystems model 491 Procise protein sequencing system (PE Applied Biosystems). Overexpression of the NADase and Orf1—An overnight culture of E. coli TOP10 harboring plasmid pBAD/His B (vector only), pBAD/His I (His tag-fused NADase and intact Orf1) or pBAD/His II (His tag-fused NADase alone) were diluted 1:20 into fresh medium and grown until the A660 reached 0.5. The culture was then induced with 0.002% or 0.02% l -arabinose for 4 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 5,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and resuspended in BugBuster™ protein extraction reagent (Novagen) at room temperature. BugBuster reagent was used according to suppliers' recommendation. After protein extraction, insoluble cell debris was removed by centrifugation (12,000 × g for 30 min), and the supernatant was used as the protein source. Similarly, an overnight culture of E. coli BL21 harboring recombinant plasmid pQE30 (His tag-fused Ofr1) was diluted 1:20 into fresh medium and grown until the A660 reached 0.5. The culture was then induced with 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d -galactopyranoside for 3 h, and the His tag-fused Ofr1 was extracted using BugBuster reagent. Preparation of TSKgel BioAssist Ni2+-chelate Column—A TSKgel BioAssist chelate column (Tosoh Co., Tokyo, Japan), prewashed with 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, containing 0.01% sodium azide (Buffer A), was loaded with 4 ml of 0.1 m Ni2SO4 solution, washed with 10 ml of Buffer A containing 500 mm imidazole, and then equilibrated with Buffer A containing 20 mm imidazole at room temperature, with a flow rate of 1 ml/min, using a Tosoh HPLC system equipped with a PEEK-type pump (Tosoh Co.). Purification of His Tag-fused NADase-Orf1 Complex—The Bug-Buster extract of E. coli TOP10 harboring recombinant plasmid pBAD/His I (encoding His tag-fused NADase and intact Orf1) was dialyzed against 2 liters of Buffer A, at 4 °C overnight. After removing a denatured material by a centrifugation (10,000 × g × 20 min), a 3.5-ml portion of the extract was loaded repeatedly on the TSKgel BioAssist Ni2+-chelate column equilibrated with Buffer A containing 20 mm imidazole. To wash out a nonspecific adsorbable material from the column, 4 ml of 0.1 m sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.8, containing 3 m NaCl and 0.01% sodium azide, was passed. Elution was performed at the flow rate of 1.0 ml/min at 20 °C, and the protein elution profile was obtained by monitoring the absorbance at 280 nm with UV8000 (Tosoh Co.). The His tag-fused NADase-Orf1 complex was recovered by a 20–250 mm linear gradient of imidazole in Buffer A, during 30 min. The complex fraction was pooled and dialyzed against Buffer A. Purification of Intact Orf1 (Mature-type without His Tag) and His Tag-fused NADase—The BugBuster extract of E. coli TOP10 harboring recombinant plasmid pBAD/His I was loaded on the TSKgel BioAssist Ni2+-chelate column as mentioned above. Orf1 was recovered by elution with 3 ml of 0.1 m sodium phosphate buffer, pH7.8 containing 3 m sodium thiocyanate (NaSCN) and 0.01% sodium azide. Then, His tag-fused NADase stuck to the column was recovered by a 20–250 mm linear gradient of imidazole in Buffer A. Purification of His Tag-fused Orf1—The BugBuster extract of E. coli cells harboring recombinant His tag-fused Orf1 expression vector was loaded on the TSKgel BioAssist Ni2+-chelate column as mentioned above. After washing, the His tag-fused Orf1 was recovered by a 20–250 mm linear gradient of imidazole in Buffer A, during 30 min. Purification of Intact NADase (Mature-type without His Tag) from the S. dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis H46A Culture—To the culture supernatant of the strain H46A, ammonium sulfate was added to 80% saturation, and the resulted precipitate was collected by a centrifugation (10,000 × g for 20 min) at 4 °C. The pellet was dissolved in 0.1 m sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, containing 0.01% sodium azide and dialyzed against the same buffer at 4 °C overnight. The clear dialyzed supernatant obtained by a centrifugation (10,000 × g for 20 min) was applied to Hydroxyapatite Bio-gel HT gel (Bio-Rad) packed into a ToyoScreen 5-ml column (Tosoh Co.) with a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min at room temperature. NADase was recovered by a linear gradient from 0.1 m to 0.5 m sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, containing 0.01% sodium azide, during 30 min. Active fractions were pooled and dialyzed against Buffer A. The dialyzed and partially purified NADase was applied to the TSKgel BioAssist Ni2+-chelate-His tag-fused Orf1 affinity column, to which 1 mg of the purified His tag-fused Orf1 had been pre-loaded and equilibrated with Buffer A containing 20 mm imidazole. After washing, the intact NADase was recovered by loading 3 ml of 0.1 m sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.8 containing 3 m NaSCN and 0.01% sodium azide at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. Each fraction (0.5 ml) was collected in tubes containing 0.5 ml water, to prevent denaturation of the protein by high concentration of NaSCN. Gel-permeation Chromatography of Intact (Mature-type without His Tag) NADase, Orf1, and NADase-Orf1 Complex—Using a TSKgel BioAssist G3SWXL column (Tosoh Co.), gel permeation chromatography of intact (mature-type without His tag) NADase, Orf1, and NADase-Orf1 complex was performed. The column was developed with 0.15 m sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.6, at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min, at room temperature. Protein elution profile was obtained by monitoring the absorbance at 280 nm. Analysis of Intracellular Orf1 of S. dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis H46A—The cell extract, obtained by digestion in the lysis solution and sonication, was applied to the anti-Orf1 antibody-conjugated HiTrap NHS-activated HP column (Amersham Biosciences). To wash out nonspecific materials, 4 ml of 0.1 m sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.8, containing 3 m sodium chloride and 0.01% sodium azide, was applied, and then Orf1 was recovered by loading 4 ml of 0.1 m sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.8, containing 3 m NaSCN and 0.01% sodium azide. Orf1 fractions were pooled and dialyzed against water. The dialyzed material was concentrated using a SpeedVac Concentrator (Savant Instrument Inc., Holbrook, NY) and subjected to SDS-PAGE. Proteins in the gel were transferred to PVDF membrane and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250. The protein band was cut off and analyzed by PE Applied Biosystems model 491 Procise protein sequencing system (PE Applied Biosystems). Antibodies—To raise rabbit anti-Orf1 antibody, ∼2 mg of His tag-fused Orf1 mixed with complete Freund's adjuvant was injected into rabbits subcutaneously. Booster injections consisting of 1 mg of proteins with an incomplete Freund's adjuvant were given three times at 2-week intervals. Immunoglobulin G fractions were purified by affinity chromatography with Protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences). Rabbit polyclonal anti-SLO IgG (containing anti-NADase antibody) was purchased from American Research Product Inc. (Belmont, MA). Immunoblot Analysis (Western Blot Analysis)—After SDS-PAGE, proteins were transferred onto Sequi-Blot PVDF membrane (Bio-Rad) by electroblotting. The membrane was blocked with 5% skim milk and 1% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween 20 (PBST) for 1 h. The membrane was washed with PBST, then first-antibody was added (diluted 1:3000 in PBST), and the blot was incubated for 1 h. Next, goat affini-pure IgG peroxidase conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd.) was added at a 1:3000 dilution in PBST, incubated for 1 h, and the antibody-antigen complexes were visualized with a POD (peroxidase) immunostaining set (Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd.) as described by the manufacturer (39Taketa K. Ichikawa E. Hanada T. J. Immunol. Methods. 1986; 95: 71-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid horseradish peroxidase conjugate (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) was used for direct detection of recombinant protein with a His tag and was used according to the supplier's recommendations. Far Western Analysis of Interaction between Orf1 and Extracellular NADase—The culture supernatant of S. dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis H46A and medium alone were run on a SDS-PAGE (10% total acrylamide), transferred to a PVDF membrane, and incubated for 1 h with or without purified His tag-fused Orf1 (10 μg/ml in PBST) at room temperature. Binding of purified His tag-fused Orf1 to NADase was assayed by Western blot analysis using anti-Orf1 antibody as described under “Immunoblot Analysis.” NADase Assay—The NADase assay was performed by using the method of Gerlach et al. (29Gerlach D. Ozegowski J.H. Gunther E. Vettermann S. Kohler W. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1996; 136: 71-78Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). One unit of the enzyme cleaves 1 μmol of NAD in 1 min at 37 °C. For the preparation of whole cell extract, the cells from a mid-logarithmic growth phase culture (10 ml) were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C in a mixture composed of 100 units/ml mutanolysin, 5 mg/ml lysozyme, 0.01% sodium azide, and 150 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.6. After incubation, the cells were sonicated, and the lysate was centrifuged in the cold, and the supernatant was used for NADase assay. Thermostability—The thermostability of the intact Orf1 (mature-type without His tag) was determined at a protein concentration of 38 μg/ml (2.0 μm) in 0.15 m sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4). The Orf1 solutions were sealed in Eppendorf tubes and incubated at 20–100 °C for 15 min. The incubation was stopped by cooling the solutions in ice water, and 0.5 μl of each solution was added to the 10 μlof5 μg/ml (0.1 μm) intact NADase (mature-type without His tag) solution containing 70 μg/ml (1 μm) bovine serum albumin in 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.5). Then, the mixture was incubated for 10 min at room temperature (final molar ratio of Orf1 and NADase was 1:2), and the remaining hydrolase activity was measured on NAD. As the control, 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.5) containing bovine serum albumin alone was used, instead of the incubated Orf1 solution. Expression of Streptococcal NADase in E. coli—In a previous study of regulation of streptococcal NADase–SLO operon, subcloning of the gene cluster in E. coli was attempted, using pHY300PLK as a vector. Although overproduction of active SLO was attained in E. coli (22Yamamoto I. Kimoto H. Taketo Y. Taketo A. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 2001; 65: 2682-2689Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), clones with the NADase gene insert were not obtained at all (16Kimoto H. Fujii Y. Yokota Y. Taketo A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1681: 134-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Taking possible host toxicity of this enzyme into consideration, the NADase gene, nga, was subcloned (Fig. 1A) into an expression vector pBAD/His for fusion with the His tag, whose araBAD promoter (PBAD) exerts strict control of gene expression on E. coli (23Guzman L.M. Belin D. Carson M.J. Beckwith J. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 4121-4130Crossref PubMed Scopus (3960) Google Scholar). In E. coli TOP10 (pBAD/His II), having the NADase gene insert alone, production of the enzyme protein upon inducing treatment with l -arabinose was undetectable by conventional exposure (Fig. 1B). A faint NADase band was, however, developed by a long time exposure (Fig. 1C), indicating scant production of the enzyme by the clone. Growth of this recombinant strain was retarded even in the absence of the inducer, and the cells partially underwent aggregation (data not shown). On the other hand, an E. coli recombinant strain, harboring pBAD/His I with a longer insert, spanning from nga to the 3′-end of orf1, produced a significant amount of NADase (Fig. 1B). Data base search indicated that Orf1 was conserved in a group A Streptococcus (GAS) strain pyogenes as well, but missing in other bacterial species (data not shown). When the whole length of NADase-SLO operon was put under PBAD control and expressed in E. coli, active SLO was produced, in addition to NADase and Orf1 (data not shown). These results suggested that intracellular streptococcal NADase is probably toxic not only to E. coli but also to Streptococcus per se, and coexpressed Orf1 might protect the possessor cocci from NAD starvation. To verify this possibility, genetic and biochemical properties of Orf1, the product of the unknown gene of NADase-SLO operon, were investigated in subsequent experiments. Expression of Orf1 and Sequencing of Its N-terminal Region—When coexpressed in E. coli under PBAD control, the amount of Orf1 surpassed that of NADase, as judged from SDS-PAGE profile (Fig. 2A). The Orf1 band was cut out from the gel and directly subjected to N-terminal amino acid sequencing. The obtained sequence, MYKVPKGLE-HYQKM, was identical with that deduced from nucleotide arrangement of the orf1 gene in the NADase-SLO operon (Fig. 2B). The gene consists of 483 bp and is capable of encoding 161 amino acids. From the nucleotide sequence, the molecular weight of the Orf1 protein was deduced to be 18,800. To demonstrate expression of the orf1 in S. dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis H46A, anti-Orf1 antibody was prepared by immunizing a rabbit with His tag-fused Orf1, produced in recombinant E. coli cells (Fig. 3A). Western blot analysis with this antibody proved that the Orf1 protein was produced and exclusively localized within H46A cocci (Fig. 3B). Molecular weight of the Orf1 coincided with that of the protein coexpressed with NADase in E. coli (Fig. 3B). Unlike SLO and NADase, Orf1 was not detected in the streptococcal culture supernatant, directly (Fig. 3B). Even the culture supernatant, concentrated 500-fold by precipitation with ammonium sulfate and then trichloroacetic acid, barely yielded a dim band of Orf1 upon Western blotting (data not shown). Purification and NH2-terminal Sequencing of Orf1 from S. dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis H46A—The Orf1 protein was extracted from S. dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis H46A and purified by affinity chromatography using an anti-Orf1 antibody-fixed column (Fig. 4). The eluate fraction was subjected to SDS-PAGE and blotted onto a PVDF membrane. Upon staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250, five bands were detected, which were possibly derived from intracellular Orf1 complex forms (Fig. 4). N-terminal sequencing revealed that the band at 19 kDa was Orf1: the sequence MYKVPKGLEHYQKM, as well as the molecular size, was the same as those deduced from the nucleotide sequence, and those of the Orf1 protein expressed in the recombinant E. coli cells. The two bands at ∼50 kDa were possibly NADase proteins, as indicated by immunoblotting (data not shown), but their amino acid sequencing was unsuccessful. It has recently been found that ∼2 kDa region was proteolytically removed from the C-terminal of NADase, after translation (16Kimoto H. Fujii Y. Yokota Y. Taketo A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1681: 134-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). If the bands at ∼50 kDa were NADase proteins, removal of the C terminus must take place within coccal cells. The thick band at ∼34 kDa was a NADase protein del"
https://openalex.org/W2134607723,"The α-amino acid ester hydrolase (AEH) from <i>Acetobacter turbidans</i> is a bacterial enzyme catalyzing the hydrolysis and synthesis of β-lactam antibiotics. The crystal structures of the native enzyme, both unliganded and in complex with the hydrolysis product d-phenylglycine are reported, as well as the structures of an inactive mutant (S205A) complexed with the substrate ampicillin, and an active site mutant (Y206A) with an increased tendency to catalyze antibiotic production rather than hydrolysis. The structure of the native enzyme shows an acyl binding pocket, in which d-phenylglycine binds, and an additional space that is large enough to accommodate the β-lactam moiety of an antibiotic. In the S205A mutant, ampicillin binds in this pocket in a non-productive manner, making extensive contacts with the side chain of Tyr<sup>112</sup>, which also participates in oxyanion hole formation. In the Y206A mutant, the Tyr<sup>112</sup> side chain has moved with its hydroxyl group toward the catalytic serine. Because this changes the properties of the β-lactam binding site, this could explain the increased β-lactam transferase activity of this mutant."

The N-terminal regulatory portion of the different members of the PKD family contains a cysteine-rich domain (CRD) comprising a tandem repeat of cysteine-rich zinc-finger like motifs, termed cys1 and cys2, that confers high affinity binding to phorbol esters and DAG followed by a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain that regulates catalytic activity (6Rozengurt E.

The C-terminal region of the PKDs contains its catalytic domain, which is distantly related to Ca2+-regulated kinases (1Valverde A.M. Sinnett-Smith J. Van Lint J. Rozengurt E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

PKDs can be activated in intact cells by pharmacological agents such as biologically active phorbol esters and physiological stimuli including G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) agonists, growth factors and antigen-receptor engagement (10Rozengurt E.

PKD, the most extensively studied member of this family of kinases, has been implicated in the regulation of a variety of cellular functions, including DNA synthesis and cell proliferation, chromatin modification, Golgi organization and function, c-Jun signaling, NFκB-mediated gene expression, and cell migration (reviewed in Ref. 10Rozengurt E.

Increasing experimental evidence support the notion that the targeting of signaling molecules to different cellular compartments is a fundamental process in the regulation of their activity (13Jaken S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 168-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar, 14Newton A.C. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 161-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (851) Google Scholar, 15Teruel M.N.

In the case of the PKD isozymes, several studies have demonstrated that despite their extensive structural homology, their intracellular distribution is notably different. PKD, which has been localized in the cytosol and in several intracellular compartments including the Golgi and mitochondria (16Prestle J. Pfizenmaier K. Brenner J. Johannes F.J. J.

This process includes a reversible translocation from the cytosol to the plasma membrane and a transient nuclear accumulation. At least two domains located in the N-terminal region of PKD, i.e. the cys2 of the CRD and the PH domain, mediate its nuclear import and export, respectively (19Rey O. Young S.H. Cantrell D.

PKD2 is a cytoplasmic protein that also undergoes a reversible plasma membrane translocation in response to GPCR agonists (23Rey O. Yuan J. Rozengurt E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 302: 817-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 24Rey O. Reeve Jr., J.R. Zhukova E. Sinnett-Smith J. Rozengurt E. J. Biol.

In contrast to PKD and PKD2, it has been established that PKD3 is present in both the nucleus and cytoplasm of unstimulated fibroblast and epithelial cells (5Rey O. Yuan J. Young S.H. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 23773-23785Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Taking advantage of the structural homology and opposite nuclear localization of PKD2 and PKD3 in unstimulated cells, we generated a set of chimeras between these isozymes to determine which PKD3 domain(s) mediates its nuclear localization. A chimeric protein comprising the regulatory N-terminal region of PKD3 and the C-terminal region of PKD2, which includes its catalytic domain, displayed a cytoplasmic distribution indistinguishable from wild type (wt) PKD2. Conversely, when the C-terminal region of wt PKD2 was replaced with the equivalent region of PKD3, the resulting protein displayed the same intracellular distribution as wt PKD3, i.e. nuclear and cytoplasmic. Further analysis demonstrated that point mutations that render PKD3 catalytically inactive completely prevented its nuclear import but not its activation loop phosphorylation. Collectively, these results indicate a novel function for the kinase activity of PKD3 in promoting its nuclear entry and suggest that the catalytic activity of PKD3 regulates its nuclear transport through autophosphorylation and/or interaction with another protein(s). Plasmids—Site-directed mutagenesis, performed as previously described (19Rey O. Young S.H. Cantrell D. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32616-32626Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), was used to engineer point mutations and restriction sites flanking the CRD, PH, and catalytic domain of PKD2 and PKD3 to generate the different plasmids. The forward (displayed) and complementary primers (not shown) used were: PKD2-CRD PacI site, 5-GCCACCTTCGAGGACTTCCAGTTAATTAACATCCGCCCGCACGCC-3; PKD2-CRD AscI site, 5-CCTTGGAGAGGTTACTGGCGCGCCCTTCAATGGAGAACC-3; PKD2-PH PvuI site, 5-GCGACACACGACGCGGCGATCGAGCACCACGCTGCGG-3; PKD2-PH PmeI site, 5-GCCCCAGGCCCTGATGTTTAAACCCGTCATCCTTCAGG-3; PKD2-catalytic domain PacI site, 5-GCATCTCTGTGTCCTTAATTAATAGTCAGATCCAACAG-3; PKD3-CRD PacI site, 5-GAAGACTTCCAGTTAATTAACATTCGTCCACATAAC-3; PKD3-CRD AscI site, 5-CCTTGGAGAGGTTACTGGCGCGCCCTTCAATGGAGAACC-3; PKD3-PH PvuI site, 5-CCATCAAGCACACAAAGAGGCGATCGAGCACAATGGTGAAGG-3; PKD3-PH PmeI site, 5-CGCCAAGCCCTCATGTTTAAACCTGTTACTCCCTCAAGC-3 and PKD3-catalytic domain PacI site, 5-GTATCTCTGTATCTTTAATTAATTGTCAGATTCAGG. After the generation of the restriction sites, the resulting cDNAs for PKD2 and PKD3 were digested to isolate the different domains, which were then subcloned into the alternative cDNA. For example, after isolating the CRD of PKD3 using PacI and AscI, the DNA fragment was moved into the cDNA of PKD2 previously digested with the same enzymes. To delete the Cys2 domain of PKD3, two AscI sites were engineered at the 5′- and 3′-regions flanking this domain using the forward (displayed) and complementary primers (not shown) 5-GCAGAGTGAAAGTTGGCGCGCCCCACACATTTGC-3 and 5-CCTTGGAGAGGTTACTGGCGCGCCCTTCAATGGAGAACC-3, respectively. The resulting mutant cDNA was digested with AscI and religated to obtain a PKD3 protein lacking amino acids 271-326. Point mutations to obtain catalytically inactive PKD3 were engineered using the forward (displayed) and complementary primers (not shown) PKD3/K605A, 5-GGGATGTGGCTATTGCAGTGATTGATAAG-3 and PKD3/D720A, 5-GGTGAAGCTGTGTGCCTTTGGATTTGCACGC-3. Vectors encoding fusion protein between a photoactivatable GFP (PAGFP) and wt PKD3, PKD3/K605A, or PKD3/D720A were obtained by isolating full-length PKD3 cDNAs from pGFP-PKD3, pGFP-PKD3/K605A, or pGFP-PKD3/D720A via KpnI digestion and subcloning the obtained DNAs into the KpnI site of pPAGFP-C1 (25Patterson G.H. Lippincott-Schwartz J. Science. 2002; 297: 1873-1877Crossref PubMed Scopus (1307) Google Scholar). A plasmid encoding a fusion protein between PKD3 and a red fluorescent protein (RFP) was obtained by ligating a full-length PKD3 cDNA, isolated by KpnI digestion from pGFP-PKD3 (5Rey O. Yuan J.

The vector encoding the fusion protein between PKD3/D720A and pFlag-CMV4 was obtained by isolating a BamHI cDNA fragment encompassing the D720A point mutations from pGFP-PKD3/D720A and exchanging this fragments for the equivalent one in pFlag-PKD3 (5Rey O.

Additionally, the perfusion chamber was mounted in a laser scanning microscope PASCAL (Carl Zeiss, Germany), which had both 405 and 488 nm lasers, to photoactivate and image PAGFP-tagged proteins with a macro we developed to automate the photoconversion and measurement process. Applying this macro, we first obtained an image of a whole cell using excitation at 488 nm and emission at 500-560 nm (preactivation). Then the image was “zoomed” 40× to focus on a small area of the cell (7.0 μm × 7.0 μm) suitable for photoconversion. The region was then scanned for 1 s with the 405 nm laser to photoactivate the PAGFP-tagged protein within a predefined region. This was followed by a return to scanning mode at 488 nm, without the “zoom,” at regular time intervals to track the movement of the photoactivated protein. Thirty cells were analyzed per experiment, and each experiment was performed at least three times. The selected cells displayed in the appropriate figures were representative of 80% of the population of PAGFP-positive cells. Indirect Immunofluorescence—Indirect immunofluorescence was performed in 10% buffered formalin phosphate-fixed, 0.3% Triton X-100-PBS-permeabilized cultures. After extensive PBS washing, fixed cells were incubated for 18 h at 25 °C in blocking buffer (PBS, 1% gelatin, 0.05% Tween 20) (BB) and then stained at 25 °C for 60 min with a murine monoclonal antibody (M2) against the FLAG epitope. Subsequently, the cells were washed with PBS, 0.05% Tween 20 at 25 °C and stained at 25 °C for 60 min with Alexa Fluor 546-conjugated goat antimouse diluted in BB and washed again with PBS, 0.05% Tween 20. After a PBS and double-distilled water wash, the samples were mounted with a gelvatol-glycerol solution containing 2.5% 1,4-diazobicyclo-[2,2,2]octane (19Rey O. Young S.H. Cantrell D. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32616-32626Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The samples were examined and imaged with an epifluorescence microscope and a Zeiss oil immersion objective (Plan-Apochromat 40×/1.0, Carl Zeiss Inc.). Images were captured as described above. Fluorescein or Alexa Fluor 546 signals were observed with HI Q filter sets for fluorescein isothiocyanate or rhodamine/TRITC, respectively (Chroma Technology). The selected cells displayed in the appropriate figures were representative of 80% of the population of positive cells. Materials—[γ-32P]ATP (370 MBq/ml), horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit and anti-mouse IgG were from Amersham Biosciences. Alexa Fluor 546 goat anti-mouse antibody was obtained from Molecular Probes. Primary antibodies were obtained from: Cell Signaling Technology (anti-loop phospho-PKD/PKCμ Ser744-Ser748, which recognizes the phosphorylation status of PKD, PKD2, and PKD3 activation loop), Sigma (anti-Flag M2), and BD Biosciences (anti-importin β, anti-importin α, and anti-GFP). All of the other reagents were the highest grade commercially available. Role of the N-terminal Region of PKD3 in Its Nuclear Localization—Although PKD2 and PKD3 share extensive structural homology (10Rozengurt E. Rey O. Waldron R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 13205-13208Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar), they localize in different cellular compartments, i.e. PKD2 is predominantly in the cytoplasm, whereas PKD3 is found both in the cytoplasm and nucleus of unstimulated fibroblast and epithelial cells (5Rey O. Yuan J. Young S.H. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 23773-23785Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 23Rey O. Yuan J. Rozengurt E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 302: 817-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). To identify the domain(s) of PKD3 that mediates its constitutive nuclear localization, we generated a set of chimeras between both isozymes (Fig. 1A) and examined the distribution of the resulting GFP-tagged proteins by live cell imaging. Because the CRD and PH domains of PKD play an important role in determining its intracellular localization (19Rey O. Young S.H. Cantrell D. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32616-32626Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 20Rey O. Sinnett-Smith J. Zhukova E. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 49228-49235Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), we replaced the CRD or PH domain of PKD2 with the CRD or PH domain from PKD3, and examined the cellular distribution of the resulting proteins. Panc-1 cells, a human pancreatic cell line that expresses all known PKD isoforms (5Rey O. Yuan J. Young S.H. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 23773-23785Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 23Rey O. Yuan J. Rozengurt E. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 1632-1640PubMed Google Scholar), were transiently transfected with pGFP-PKD2/CRD3 or pGFP-PKD2/PH3 and examined 18 h post-transfection. As Fig. 2A shows, neither the CRD nor the PH domain of PKD3 induce redistribution from the cytosol into the nucleus of GFP-PKD2/CRD3 or GFP-PKD2/PH3, indicating that these domains are not sufficient to promote the nuclear localization of these chimeric proteins. To further substantiate this conclusion, we replaced the CRD and PH domain of PKD3 by the equivalent domains isolated from PKD2. The resulting chimeras, GFP-PKD3/CRD2 and GFP-PKD3/PH2, showed a cytosolic and nuclear localization indistinguishable from wt PKD3 (Fig. 2B), indicating that neither the CRD nor the PH domain of PKD2 prevented the nuclear localization of PKD3. Further support for this conclusion was obtained by simultaneously replacing the CRD and PH domains of PKD2 for their PKD3 equivalents. The resulting fusion protein, GFP-PKD2/CRD3+PH3, displayed the same intracellular distribution as wt PKD2, i.e. it was present in the cytosol and excluded from the nucleus (Fig. 2A). Reciprocally, a chimera containing the CRD and PH domain of PKD2 and the C-terminal kinase region of PKD3 (GFP-PKD3/CRD2+PH2) had the same intracellular distribution as wt PKD3 (Fig. 2B), indicating that the N-terminal region of PKD3 is not sufficient to promote its nuclear localization. A classical nuclear localization signal has not been documented in PKD. However, its nuclear accumulation in response to GPCR stimulation can be completely prevented by deleting its cys2 domain (20Rey O. Sinnett-Smith J. Zhukova E. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 49228-49235Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Consequently, we deleted the cys2 domain of PKD3 and transiently expressed the mutated protein in Panc-1 cells. As shown in Fig. 2C, the deletion of the cys2 of PKD3 caused a conspicuous reduction in GFP-PKD3/Δcys2 nuclear localization. However, this deletion did not block the nuclear entry of PKD3 to the extent observed with PKD/Δcys2 (20Rey O. Sinnett-Smith J. Zhukova E. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 49228-49235Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), supporting the conclusion that another domain of PKD3 outside its N-terminal region is involved in its nuclear localization. PKD3 Nuclear Localization Requires Its Catalytic Activity—In view of the preceding results, we exchanged the C-terminal regions of PKD2 and PKD3 (Fig. 1A) and examined the intracellular distribution of GFP-PKD2/CD3 and GFP-PKD3/CD2 in live cells. Surprisingly, we found that the intracellular distribution of GFP-PKD2/CD3 was indistinguishable from GFP-PKD3 (Fig. 3A), indicating that the replacement of the C-terminal region of PKD2 by the equivalent region from PKD3 was sufficient to promote the nuclear localization of this chimeric protein. Conversely, the substitution of the C-terminal region of PKD3 for the equivalent domain of PKD2 resulted in a chimeric protein that had the same distribution as wt PKD2 (Fig. 3A). Similar results were obtained when GFP-PKD2/CD3 and GFP-PKD3/CD2 were expressed in Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts (Fig. 3B), HEK-293 (Fig. 3C), and COS-7 cells (data not shown), demonstrating that the nuclear localization mediated by the C-terminal kinase region of PKD3 is not restricted to Panc-1 cells. The results presented above showing that the C-terminal kinase region of PKD3 was necessary for its nuclear localization prompted us to investigate whether its catalytic activity was also required because the intracellular distribution of several kinases is associated to their catalytic activity (29Lemrow S.M.

In the first mutant, the lysine 605 at the ATP binding site was substituted with alanine (PKD3/K605A), while in the second one the highly conserved aspartic acid located at position 720 in the DFG motif, which is critical for kinase catalytic activity (32Hanks S.K. Hunter T. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 576-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (2296) Google Scholar), was mutated to alanine (PKD3/D720A). To verify the properties of these mutants, COS-7 cells expressing GFP-PKD3, GFP-PKD3/K605A, or GFP-PKD3/D720A were stimulated with phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate (PDBu) for 10 min and lysed, and the fusion proteins were immunoprecipitated from the extracts with an antibody against GFP. PKD3 activity in the immunocomplexes was determined by phosphorylation of syntide-2, an excellent substrate for PKD3 (5Rey O. Yuan J. Young S.H. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 23773-23785Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). In agreement with our previous results, GFP-PKD3 isolated from unstimulated cells had low catalytic activity that was markedly activated by PDBu stimulation of intact cells (Fig. 3D). In contrast, no kinase activity was associated with the immunoprecipitated GFP-PKD3/K605A or GFP-PKD3/D720A proteins before and after PDBu stimulation (Fig. 3D). Similar results were obtained when PKD3 activity in the immunocomplexes was determined by PKD3 autophosphorylation (Fig. 3E). Once we established that GFP-PKD3/K605A and GFP-PKD3/D720A were catalytically inactive, these proteins were expressed in Panc-1 cells, and their intracellular distribution was examined in live cells 18 h posttransfection. In contrast to the nuclear and cytoplasmic localization of GFP-PKD3, GFP-PKD3/K605A and PKD3/D720A were pres"

Since little is known regarding the effects of DNA damage on RecQ helicases, and because the replication and recombination defects in Werner syndrome cells may reflect abnormal processing of damaged DNA associated with the replication fork, we examined the effects of specific bulky, covalent adducts at N6 of deoxyadenosine (dA) or N2 of deoxyguanosine (dG) on Werner (WRN) syndrome helicase activity. The adducts are derived from the optically active 7,8-diol 9,10-epoxide (DE) metabolites of the carcinogen benzo[a]pyrene (BaP). The results demonstrate that WRN helicase activity is inhibited in a strand-specific manner by BaP DE-dG adducts only when on the translocating strand. These adducts either occupy the minor groove without significant perturbation of DNA structure (trans adducts) or cause base displacement at the adduct site (cis adducts). In contrast, helicase activity is only mildly affected by intercalating BaP DE-dA adducts that locally perturb DNA double helical structure. This differs from our previous observation that intercalating dA adducts derived from benzo[c]phenanthrene (BcPh) DEs inhibit WRN activity in a strand- and stereospecific manner. Partial unwinding of the DNA helix at BaP DE-dA adduct sites may make such adducted DNAs more susceptible to the action of helicase than DNA containing the corresponding BcPh DE-dA adducts, which cause little or no destabilization of duplex DNA. The single-stranded DNA binding protein RPA, an auxiliary factor for WRN helicase, enabled the DNA unwinding enzyme to overcome inhibition by either the trans-R or cis-R BaP DE-dG adduct, suggesting that WRN and RPA may function together to unwind duplex DNA harboring specific covalent adducts that otherwise block WRN helicase acting alone.

DNA damage evokes a cellular response by a genome surveillance system that senses DNA structural perturbation at the site of the lesion and elicits an appropriate response that may involve direct repair of the lesion, stabilization of the replication fork, or induction of apoptosis (1Zhou B.B. Elledge S.J. Nature. 2000; 408: 433-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (2619) Google Scholar). Cellular pathways of DNA metabolism are influenced by DNA lesions, and since DNA unwinding enzymes known as helicases are among the first proteins to encounter DNA damage, it is of interest to understand how helicase action is modulated by interaction with chemically modified DNA. Although the mechanism for DNA unwinding has been studied for several helicases (2Lohman T.M. Bjornson K.P. Annu. Rev.

Biochemical characterization of the DNA substrate specificity of WRN helicase has revealed that the enzyme has the ability to target DNA replication/repair intermediate structures by its ability to recognize DNA junctions (7Brosh Jr., R.M. Waheed J. Sommers J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 23236-23245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Analysis of presteady state kinetics of WRN helicase indicated that the burst amplitude (unwound 19-base pair (bp) forked duplex molecules) was very close to the WRN protein concentration, suggesting that WRN can function as a monomer to unwind the duplex DNA substrate (8Choudhary S.

Studying the effects of DNA damage on the activity of RecQ helicases may lead to insight on how these helicases act upon encountering specific DNA adducts and how the absence of a given RecQ helicase contributes to genomic instability.Benzo[a]pyrene (BaP) in the diet and in the air from combustion of fuel and tobacco is one of the most potent carcinogens to which humans are frequently exposed (21Committee on the Biological Effects of Atmospheric PollutantsParticulate Polycyclic Organic Matter.

Two diastereomers (each of which exists as a pair of enantiomers) of a given bay region DE are metabolically possible, one diastereomer (DE-1) in which the benzylic hydroxyl group and the epoxide oxygen are cis and one in which these two groups are trans (DE-2). Cis or trans opening of the epoxide ring of BaP DE by the exocyclic amino group N6 of adenine or N2 of guanine results in covalent DNA adducts (Scheme 1) (23Jerina D.M. Chadha A. Cheh A.M.

In addition to these classes of DNA-metabolizing enzymes, helicases are likely to be subject to the adverse effects of DNA lesions induced by environmental chemicals.In the current study, we observe that the effects of BaP DE adducts with defined structural motifs on WRN helicase activity are specific to the nature of the modified base as well as to the strand on which the lesion is located. Thus, a single BaP DE-dG adduct with either cis or trans, R or S stereochemistry inhibited WRN in a strand-specific manner, whereas either a cis or trans, R or S BaP DE-dA adduct had little effect. These results suggest that the effects of BaP DE adducts on WRN helicase activity are related to the base to which the adduct is covalently attached and dependent on the structure of the BaP DE DNA adduct, such that WRN helicase activity is sensitive to BaP DE dG adducts, which cause flipped out bases or occupy the minor groove. The single-stranded DNA-binding protein RPA, which serves as an auxiliary factor for the WRN helicase, enabled WRN to overcome the inhibition exerted by either the cis or trans BaP DE-dG adduct, suggesting that WRN and RPA may function together to unwind duplex DNA harboring specific covalent DNA adducts that otherwise block WRN helicase acting alone.MATERIALS AND METHODSProteins—Recombinant hexahistidine-tagged WRN protein was overexpressed using a baculovirus/Sf9 insect system and purified as described previously (19Sharma S.

Unadducted oligonucleotides were purchased from Lofstrand Technologies. Oligonucleotides containing diastereomerically pure cis- and trans-opened BaP DE-dA or BaP DE-dG adducts were synthesized using a semiautomated procedure, essentially as described (50Kroth H. Yagi H.

The synthesized oligonucleotides were purified by reverse-phase high pressure liquid chromatography after removal of the 5′-protecting dimethoxytrityl group. Typically, each oligonucleotide was chromatographed twice, utilizing two different columns successively: 1) a Hamilton PRP-1 column (7 μm, 10 × 250 mm) at 25 °C (retention times between 16 and 18 min for all oligonucleotides) and 2) a Waters XTerra MS C18 column (2.5 μm, 10 × 50 mm) at 25 or 45 °C (retention times between 10 and 13 min at 45 °C). Elution was at 3 ml/min with a gradient that increased the proportion of solvent B in A from 0 to 35% over 20 min, where solvent A is 0.1 m (NH4)2CO3 buffer and B is a 1:1 mixture of A with acetonitrile, both adjusted to pH 7.0–7.5. The absolute configurations of the adducts are known from the diastereomerically pure reactant phosphoramidites (51Khan Q.A. Kohlhagen G. Marshall R. Austin C.A. Kalena G.P. Kroth H. Sayer J.M.

Reactions were initiated with the addition of the indicated helicase and then incubated at 37 °C for 15 min. Reactions were quenched with 20 μl of Stop buffer (35 mm EDTA, 0.6% SDS, 25% glycerol, 0.04% bromphenol blue, 0.04% xylene cyanol) containing a 10-fold excess of unlabeled oligonucleotide of the same sequence as the labeled strand of the DNA fork substrate. The products of the helicase reactions were resolved on nondenaturing 12% polyacrylamide gels. Radiolabeled DNA species in polyacrylamide gels were visualized using a PhosphorImager and quantitated using ImageQuant software (Amersham Biosciences). The percentage of helicase substrate unwound was calculated by the formula, percentage of unwinding = 100 × (P/(S + P)), where P is the product and S is the residual substrate. The values of P and S have been corrected after subtracting background values in controls having no enzyme and heat-denatured substrate, respectively. Helicase data represent the mean of at least three independent experiments, with mean ± S.D. shown by error bars.For helicase sequestration studies, WRN (3 nm in a 20-μl reaction) was preincubated with 0–500 fmol of the indicated unlabeled single-stranded DNA or unlabeled forked duplex DNA molecules in standard helicase reaction conditions as described above for 3 min at 37 °C. After the 3-min incubation, 10 fmol of radiolabeled forked duplex tracker substrate was added to the reaction mixture and incubated for 7 min at 37 °C. Reactions were quenched and resolved on native polyacrylamide gels as described above. Typically, 75–90% of the tracker helicase substrate was unwound in reactions lacking the competitor DNA molecule.For kinetic helicase assays, 160-μl reaction mixtures containing the standard helicase reaction salts (see above), 0.5 nm duplex DNA substrate, 4.6 nm WRN in the presence or absence of 12 nm RPA were incubated for 0–4 min at 37 °C. 20-μl reaction volumes were removed and quenched as described above at the specified times. To correct for duplex destabilization by RPA, the background value for displaced strand (≤10%) in RPA alone reaction mixtures was subtracted from those values obtained for the WRN-RPA helicase reaction products. UvrD kinetic assays were conducted similar to the WRN kinetic assays except that UvrD (12 nm) was incubated with the substrate for 0–8 min at 37 °C.RESULTSTo evaluate the effects of DNA structural perturbations induced by adducts formed from DEs of the chemical carcinogen BaP on WRN helicase activity, we have tested a series of related forked duplex DNA substrates with a covalently bonded site-specific BaP DE adduct positioned centrally in the 22-bp duplex region on one of the two DNA strands. The sequence chosen for placement of the adduct within the duplex is found in the coding sequence (exon 7) of the p53 gene (54Hussain S.P. Amstad P. Raja K. Sawyer M. Hofseth L. Shields P.G. Hewer A. Phillips D.H. Ryberg D. Haugen A. Harris C.C. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 6350-6355PubMed Google Scholar). The site of the adducted base, BaP DE-dG or BaP DE-dA (Table 1), corresponded to p53 hotspot codons 248 and 249, respectively. The design of the DNA substrates used in this study enabled us to assess the effects of adduct stereochemistry, orientation, strand occupation, and nature of the DNA structural perturbation on WRN helicase activity.For both the adducted (BaP DE-dA or BaP DE-dG) and unadducted forked duplex (22-bp) substrates, the intact oligonucleotide was released with minimal degradation (<2%) from the blunt end by WRN exonuclease as observed on native gels and confirmed on urea-denaturing gels (data not shown). Similar unwinding of the DNA substrates by an exonuclease-defective mutant WRN protein (WRN-E84A) was also observed (data not shown). These results are consistent with the previous observation that displacement of short (16- and 22-bp) duplex substrates by WRN helicase activity is more rapid than digestion by the WRN exonuclease activity (55Opresko P.L.

For all of the five substrates tested, the percentage of duplex unwound depended on the concentration of WRN present in the reaction (Fig. 2A). The quantitative results from these assays demonstrated that WRN unwinding was not affected by the BaP DE-dA adducts residing in the nontranslocating strand, regardless of their stereochemistry.FIGURE 2Effects of BaP DE-dA adducts on WRN helicase activity.

The function of the resulting receptor complex depends critically on the presence of activated JAK2, and the complex contains a large number of signaling molecules recruited to eight phosphorylated tyrosine residues. Studies using mutant receptor forms have demonstrated that truncated receptors lacking all tyrosines are able to support red blood cell development with low efficiency, whereas add-back mutants containing either Tyr343 or Tyr479 reconstitute EPOR signaling and erythropoiesis in vivo. To study the contribution of tyrosines to receptor function, we analyzed the activation of essential signaling pathways and early gene induction promoted by different receptor structural variants using human epidermal growth factor receptor/murine EPOR hybrids. In our experiments, receptors lacking all tyrosine residues or the JAK2-binding site did not induce mitogenic and anti-apoptotic signaling, whereas add-back mutant receptors containing single tyrosine residues (Try343 and Tyr479) supported the activation of these functions efficiently. Profiling of early gene expression using cDNA array hybridization revealed that (i) the high redundancy in the activation of signaling pathways is continued at the level of transcription; (ii) the expression of many genes targeted by the wild-type receptor is not supported by add-back mutants; and (iii) a small set of genes are exclusively induced by add-back receptors.

Blood. 1991; 77: 419-434Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The corresponding EPO receptor (EPOR), a member of the type 1 cytokine receptor family, is expressed on the surface of erythroid burst- and colony-forming units (2Wu H. Liu X. Jaenisch R. Lodish H.F. Cell. 1995; 83: 59-67Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (861) Google Scholar). In contrast to other receptor types, these receptors lack any intrinsic activity and are activated by the induction of a special conformation of pre-existing homodimers after ligand binding (3Seubert N. Royer Y. Staerk J. Kubatzky K.F. Moucadel V. Krishnakumar S. Smith S.O. Constantinescu S.N. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 1239-1250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). The recruitment and activation of the cytosolic tyrosine kinase JAK2 have been shown to be the first and crucial steps in the formation of a multiprotein receptor complex that is responsible for the initiation of diverse signaling pathways (4Witthuhn B.A. Quelle F.W. Silvennoinen O. Yi T. Tang B. Miura O. Ihle J.N. Cell. 1993; 74: 227-236Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1008) Google Scholar). Activated JAK2 mediates the phosphorylation of tyrosine residues within the intracellular receptor domain, providing docking sites for Src homology 2 (SH2) domain-encoding effector molecules, including the JAK2 substrate STAT5, a transcription factor that is rapidly translocated to the nucleus (5Gouilleux F.

Among additional proteins that have been shown to be physically associated with the EPOR following ligand binding are phospholipase Cγ1 (6Ren H.Y. Komatsu N. Shimizu R. Okada K. Miura Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19633-19638Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (7Damen J.E. Cutler R.L. Jiao H. Yi T. Krystal G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23402-23408Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Furthermore, negative regulators are also engaged and terminate receptor-dependent signaling by affecting JAK2, such as the tyrosine phosphatase SHP1 (8Klingmuller U. Lorenz U. Cantley L.C. Neel B.G. Lodish H.F. Cell. 1995; 80: 729-738Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (842) Google Scholar) and the suppressor of cytokine signaling SOCS3 (9Hansen J.A. Lindberg K. Hilton D.J. Nielsen J.H. Billestrup N. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 1832-1843Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), or compete for receptor-binding sites, as shown for CIS (10Quelle F.W. Wang D. Nosaka T. Thierfelder W.E. Stravopodis D. Weinstein Y. Ihle J.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1622-1631Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). The signaling events initiated by the receptor complex result in post-translational, transcriptional, and translational changes and mediate different responses of erythroid cells, induction of mitogenesis, and differentiation but also anti-apoptotic pathways. Some of the signals and biological responses reported have been related to distinct receptor substructures by studies using mutant receptors expressed in cell lines. For example, STAT5 activation has been assigned to phosphotyrosines 343 and 401, whereas the p85 regulatory subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) was shown to interact with phosphotyrosine 479 (11Wojchowski D.M. Gregory R.C. Miller C.P. Pandit A.K. Pircher T.J. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 253: 143-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Although these and other interactions have been confirmed in different cell lines, other studies revealed the ability of receptor forms that are heavily truncated or that lack all tyrosine residues to support the maturation of erythroid cells (12Socolovsky M. Dusanter-Fourt I. Lodish H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14009-14012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 13Miller C.P. Heiman D.W. Wojchowski D.M.

Despite the existence of extensive data on the signaling abilities of EPOR structural variants, it is still not clear how these molecules transform their potential into a cellular response. The first step in the initiation of a certain cellular program is the induction of a specific set of immediate-early genes. Many of these genes that are rapidly transcribed after cytokine challenge encode transcription factors, which in turn regulate additional genes involved in the cellular response. The aim of this study was to compare the ability of different receptor structural variants to transmit the induction of early gene transcription. We employed a set of hybrid receptors consisting of the ligand-binding domain of the human epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor (EGFR) and the transmembrane and intracellular domains of the murine EPOR to bypass endogenous EPO responsivity of the Ba/F3 cells studied. EGF-stimulated hybrid receptors were used to analyze the role of distinct receptor substructures in transcriptional regulation by cDNA array hybridization. To define the relative importance of positively acting tyrosine residues in receptor function, we studied receptors lacking all tyrosine residues or the JAK2-binding site as well as receptors containing single tyrosine residues (Tyr343 and Tyr479) that are believed to reconstitute the entire functionality of the receptor. By analysis of gene expression induced following activation of the EGFR/EPOR hybrids, we identified several new early genes that have not been implicated in the context of an EPOR-dependent response so far. Cell Culture, Cytokine Stimulation, Inhibitors, and Expression of EGFR/EPOR Hybrids—Ba/F3 cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen, Karlsruhe, Germany) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS) and conditioned medium from WEHI-3 cells (15Ymer S. Tucker W.Q. Sanderson C.J. Hapel A.J. Campbell H.D. Young I.G. Nature. 1985; 317: 255-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar) as a source of murine interleukin-3 (IL-3). Unless stated otherwise, cells were depleted of growth factor before stimulation with 200 ng/ml recombinant human EGF (PeproTech EC Ltd., London, UK) or 100 pm murine IL-3 (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) for the times indicated. When applying inhibitors, cells were preincubated in the presence of drugs for 1 h prior to cytokine challenge (PD98059 (Promega Corp., Mannheim, Germany) or wortmannin (New England Biolabs Inc., Frankfurt am Main, Germany)). The chimeric receptor constructs were generated as described previously (16Bittorf T. Büchse T. Sasse T. Jaster R. Brock J. Cell. Signal. 2001; 13: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Briefly, constructs were established by fusing wild-type and mutant forms of the murine EPOR intracellular and transmembrane domains to the human EGFR extracellular domain, followed by stable transfection in murine Ba/F3 cells. All constructs used in this study were verified by dideoxy sequencing of the complete coding region. Clones expressing matched levels of EGFR/EPOR were initially selected as described (16Bittorf T. Büchse T. Sasse T. Jaster R. Brock J. Cell. Signal. 2001; 13: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), and their surface expression of transfected hybrid receptors was periodically verified by flow cytometric analysis (see Fig. 2). Analysis of EGFR/EPOR Expression—To confirm EGFR/EPOR expression, cells (1 × 106) were incubated with an R-phycoerythrin-labeled antibody directed against the EGFR extracellular domain (clone EGFR.1, BD Biosciences, Heidelberg, Germany) and diluted in phosphate-buffered saline, 0.5% bovine serum albumin, and 2 mm EDTA (pH 7.4) for 45 min on ice. The cells were then washed and analyzed by flow cytometry (FACSCalibur, BD Biosciences). Finally, propidium iodide was added to discriminate between viable and nonviable cells. As negative staining controls, cells were incubated with an R-phycoerythrin-conjugated immunoglobulin subclass isotype control antibody directed against dansyl (clone 27-35, BD Biosciences). Negative (parental Ba/F3) and positive (A431; ATCC CRL-1555) cell controls were included also. Proliferation Assay—Cell viability was measured using metabolic conversion of WST-1 reagent (Roche Diagnostics GmbH, Mannheim) (17Berridge M.V. Tan A.S. Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2000; 2: 231-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) following the manufacturer's instructions. In short, cells were deprived of IL-3 and immediately restimulated by different concentrations of EGF or IL-3 for 45 h in 96-well microtiter plates (3000 cells/100 μl). For background determination, a control well without cells was treated in parallel for every microtiter plate. Subsequently, 10 μl of WST-1 reagent was added to each well, and metabolic cellular activity was assessed after 2–4 h of incubation by measuring absorbance at 450 nm (with 620 nm as a reference). To compare values obtained from different microtiter plates, data were normalized by inclusion of a set of standard samples on every plate. Induction of Apoptosis and Detection of Apoptotic Cells—Cells were cultured in the presence of 40 ng/ml EGF or 20 pm IL-3 or in medium without supplementation. The optimal time of incubation was determined in preliminary experiments and varied from 9 to 22 h. EGF and IL-3 concentrations were chosen to be in the range of a submaximal cellular response as specified by dose-response experiments. Phosphatidylserine exposed on the outer side of the plasma membrane as an early apoptotic marker was detected by binding to fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled annexin V and measured by flow cytometry according to the manufacturer's instructions using an annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate apoptosis detection kit (Merck Biosciences, Bad Soden, Germany). Apoptotic cells were distinguished from necrotic cells by dye exclusion (propidium iodide). For data analysis, the ratio of the percentage of apoptotic (fluorescein isothiocyanate-positive, propidium iodidenegative) cells incubated in the presence of EGF or IL-3, respectively, to the percentage of apoptotic cells in the unstimulated control was calculated. Immunoblotting—Cell lysates were prepared by boiling 5 × 105 cells from each sample in 100 μl of SDS sample buffer (10% (v/v) glycerol, 2% (w/v) SDS, 5% (v/v) β-mercaptoethanol, and 0.05% (w/v) bromphenol blue). Total protein was separated on SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Rodgau-Jügesheim, Germany) as described previously (18Bittorf T. Jaster R. Brock J. Cell. Signal. 1994; 6: 305-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Membranes were blocked with 5% bovine serum albumin and incubated with primary antibodies. Excess antibodies were washed out three times with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20. After a final incubation with a horseradish peroxidase-labeled anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG antibody (Amersham Biosciences, Freiburg) and three more washing steps, blots were developed using the ECL Plus chemiluminescent detection system (Amersham Biosciences). Antibodies directed against phospho-Thr202/Tyr204 p44/42 MAPK, phospho-Tyr694 STAT5, phospho-Ser473 Akt, and Akt were purchased from New England Biolabs Inc. Additional antibodies were obtained as indicated: anti-MAPK (BD Biosciences); anti-p85α PI3K (Upstate, Lake Placid, NY); and anti-STAT5, anti-phospho-Tyr508 p85α PI3K, and anti-Raf-1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Heidelberg). Membranes were stripped by agitation in 62.5 mm Tris, 2% (w/v) SDS, and 100 mm β-mercaptoethanol (pH 6.8) for 30 min at 50 °C before reprobing. Northern Blotting—Cells were deprived of FCS and growth factors for 6 h and restimulated with EGF or IL-3 or left untreated for the times indicated. Total RNA was purified with TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen), and 10 μg of each RNA sample was loaded onto a 1.2% agarose gel containing 1.2 m formaldehyde. After transfer onto nylon membrane (Hybond-N, Amersham Biosciences), samples were hybridized with [α-32P]dCTP-labeled DNA probes specific for the mRNAs of the genes investigated. Hybridization was performed with QuikHyb solution (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) following the manufacturer's instructions. Data were obtained by exposure to x-ray films or using a Fuji Bas-1800 II bio-imaging analyzer (Raytest, Straubenhardt, Germany) and quantified by densitometry. Membranes were stripped by agitation in 0.1× SSC and 0.1% (w/v) SDS for 10 min at 95 °C. Successful stripping was monitored by autoradiography. Real-time Quantitative Reverse Transcription-PCR—Total RNA was isolated as described above and reverse-transcribed using oligo(dT) priming and Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Promega Corp.). Analysis of target cDNA levels was performed by real-time PCR using the TaqMan™ Universal PCR Master Mix and an ABI Prism 7000 sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems, Darmstadt, Germany). For the detection of zfp36 cDNA, we used the Assays-on-Demand™ mouse gene-specific fluorescently labeled TaqMan™ MGB™ probe (assay Mm00457144_m1). The hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase housekeeping gene hprt was quantified using the TaqMan™ MGB™ probe (assay Mm00446968_m1) as a reference. Both probes were purchased from Applied Biosystems and designed to exclude the detection of genomic DNA. PCR conditions were set up as follows: 95 °C for 10 min and 40 cycles at 95 °C for 15 s and at 60 °C for 1 min. All experiments were performed at least in triplicate. Expression of zfp36 mRNAs was normalized to hprt according to the following equation: ΔCt = Ct(zfp36) – Ct(hprt). ΔΔCt values were calculated by subtracting ΔCt of the samples from ΔCt of the corresponding controls and used to express the factor of zfp36 induction depicted (2^ΔΔCt). mRNA Expression Analysis Using cDNA Arrays: Isolation of mRNA and Preparation of Radiolabeled cDNA Probes—RNA was purified using the Atlas pure total RNA labeling system (BD Biosciences). Briefly, a minimum of 4 × 107 cells were collected by centrifugation and lysed. Total RNA was separated from cell debris by several phenol and chloroform washing steps, followed by precipitation with isopropyl alcohol and ethanol. Prior to quality and purity checks of RNA, genomic DNA was digested with DNase I. RNA recovery was performed after treatment with phenol and chloroform by precipitation using sodium acetate and ethanol. Poly(A)+ RNA was isolated using streptavidin-coated magnetic beads after incubation of up to 50 μg of total RNA with biotinylated oligo(dT). Radiolabeled cDNA probes were synthesized and isolated as described in the Atlas cDNA expression array user manual (BD Biosciences). In short, poly(A)+ RNA (see above) was subjected to reverse transcription in the presence of [α-32P]dATP (3000 Ci/mmol; Amersham Biosciences) and a cDNA synthesis primer mixture (specific to immobilized cDNA probes). The labeled cDNA probes were separated from unincorporated [α-32P]dATP by column chromatography following the manufacturer's instructions. Array Hybridization and Data Analysis—Atlas 1.2 mouse membranes were treated as recommended by the manufacturer. Briefly, radioactive cDNA samples were heated at 100 °C for 2 min, quickly chilled on ice, and subsequently added to the prehybridization mixture. Hybridization was carried out overnight at 68 °C, followed by several washing steps. Sealed arrays were exposed to a bio-imaging screen. Hybridization intensities of spotted genes were detected using the Fuji Bas-1800 II bio-imaging analyzer and AIDA software (Raytest). Data normalization and determination of local background thresholds and expression changes were performed by specially developed algorithms described in detail under “Results.” Structural Variants of an EGFR/EPOR Chimera Differ in Their Ability to Trigger Mitogenesis and Survival of Ba/F3 Cells—To study the role of distinct receptor structures in the induction of EPO-dependent intracellular signaling pathways, we engineered the pro-B cell line Ba/F3 to express hybrid receptors consisting of the extracellular domain of the human EGFR fused to the transmembrane and intracellular domains of the murine EPOR. We have shown previously that these hybrid receptors induce EPOR-specific signaling after EGF challenge and provide a model to investigate the function of stably expressed mutant receptors bypassing endogenous wild-type receptors (16Bittorf T. Büchse T. Sasse T. Jaster R. Brock J. Cell. Signal. 2001; 13: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 19Körbel S. Büchse T. Prietzsch H. Sasse T. Schumann M. Krause E. Brock J. Bittorf T. Proteomics. 2005; 5: 91-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). In this study, we attempted to analyze a set of mutant receptors for modifications in their ability to induce early gene expression compared with wild-type (WT) EGFR/EPOR (Fig. 1). The YF EGFR/EPOR mutant lacks all eight tyrosine residues (converted to phenylalanine) known to serve as SH2 domain-docking sites and has been designed to study the role of receptor phosphorylation. A second mutant designated W282R EGFR/EPOR contains a single amino acid substitution (tryptophan to arginine) in a region proximal to the membrane, causing an inability to associate with the cytosolic tyrosine kinase JAK2, which has been shown to be an essential part for most but not all of the known receptor functions (20Miura O. Nakamura N. Quelle F.W. Witthuhn B.A. Ihle J.N. Aoki N. Blood. 1994; 84: 1501-1507Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Early gene induction triggered by this mutant receptor should therefore reflect the activity of JAK2-independent signaling events. Two additional receptors (Y343 and Y479 EGFR/EPOR) were designed as add-back mutants to study the role of single tyrosine residues within the EPOR intracellular domain. Single cell clones were established and analyzed for their surface expression of transfected hybrid receptors by flow cytometric analysis. We employed an antibody directed against the EGFR extracellular domain (clone EGFR.1). The results of a representative experiment including all cell clones used in this study are depicted in Fig. 2. Compared with control cells (parental Ba/F3) and isotype controls, transfected cells showed a substantial and comparable expression of receptor isotypes. Cell clones stably expressing the receptor types described were initially characterized for their EGF-dependent mitogenic potential and their ability to prevent apoptotic death. To prove the responsivity of the cell clones derived by stable transfection, we always included analysis of IL-3-dependent responses. All cell clones used were established from parental IL-3-dependent Ba/F3 cells and showed a comparative proliferative response as depicted in Fig. 3. Although we observed a dose-dependent mitogenic response in each case, slight differences may be due to clonal variation. In contrast, the EGF-dependent proliferation showed dramatic differences. The receptor forms lacking tyrosine residues (YF EGFR/EPOR) and the JAK2-binding site (W282R EGFR/EPOR) failed to induce mitogenesis completely. Compared with the WT protein, add-back mutant receptors (Y343 and Y479 EGFR/EPOR) induced a significant but diminished proliferative capacity. The ability to transmit anti-apoptotic activities is shared by many cytokine receptors, including the EPOR. Ba/F3 cells rapidly undergo apoptosis after withdrawal of growth factors. IL-3 was a potent inhibitor of apoptosis for all Ba/F3 clones used in this study (Fig. 4). As shown by flow cytometric analysis, the WT EGFR/EPOR hybrid was also able to suppress the induction of apoptosis effectively. As already shown for the mitogenic activity, the existence of an intact JAK2-binding site and tyrosine residues in the intracellular domain is essential for anti-apoptotic pathways, too. Our data show that the existence of Tyr343 or Tyr479 restored these activities to levels slightly lower or higher than the WT receptor, respectively. It is important to note that the receptor containing Tyr479 conferred the highest potential to suppress apoptosis. Taken together, the established system of structural receptor variants reflects essential EPOR functions and allows the dissection of the role of receptor substructures in the induction of signaling pathways and transcriptional regulation. Distinct Signaling Pathways Are Induced by EGFR/EPOR Variants— In the next step, we analyzed the signaling capacity of the receptors by investigating pathways known to be critically involved in the induction of EPOR-dependent cellular activities. Again, we included data on the IL-3-dependent response to make sure that the cellular signaling capacity of all cell clones was functionally intact. As shown in Fig. 5A by the phosphorylation of p42 and p44 MAPKs as well as the phosphorylation-induced mobility shift of Raf-1, the Ras/Raf/MAPK signaling pathway was targeted by both the IL-3 receptor and the EGFR/EPOR hybrid. The ability of mutant receptors to trigger mitogenesis was closely correlated with their potency to activate the MAPK pathway. In contrast to the YF and W282R EGFR/EPOR mutants, which obviously lack essential structures to couple to the cascade, the Y479 EGFR/EPOR mutant induced an activity comparable with the WT receptor, whereas the Y343 EGFR/EPOR mutant lost a substantial part of its potency. The second pathway investigated was the JAK/STAT signaling cascade, which has been shown to be involved in diverse cytokine functions. The EPOR specifically activates JAK2 and the latent transcription factor STAT5. The phosphorylation of STAT5 by receptor-dependent activities was studied using a phosphospecific antibody (anti-phospho-Tyr694 STAT5). The results, as well as those observed after reprobing with an antibody directed against STAT5, are shown in Fig. 5B. Besides the WT receptor, only the add-back mutant receptors containing a single tyrosine residue were able to activate STAT5, underlining the necessity of docking sites in the intracellular domain as well as the presence of receptor-associated JAK2. The reprobed blot shows both unphosphorylated and phosphorylated STAT5, which underwent a mobility shift (upper band). The promotion of cell survival has been shown to be supported by the Akt pathway. We analyzed the activity of two components, the phosphorylation of p85 PI3K and Akt (also known as protein kinase B). The corresponding results are shown in Fig. 5C for both phosphospecific antibodies and antibodies directed against protein-specific epitopes (loading control). Interestingly, only the Y479 EGFR/EPOR mutant triggered this pathway at levels comparable with the WT receptor, whereas all other mutant receptors were no longer able to enhance the activity of Akt. The Y343 EGFR/EPOR mutant partially retained the ability to induce PI3K activity; but at the level of Akt, no response was detectable. In summary, the data demonstrate the dependence of distinct signaling properties on certain receptor substructures, which should give rise to a different capacity to induce gene expression. Changes in mRNA Expression Caused by Stimulation of EGFR/EPOR Chimeras: Time Course and Methodology—A primary goal of our studies exploring the intracellular signaling triggered by EGF stimulation of Ba/F3 cells stably expressing exogenous EGFR/EPOR hybrids was to investigate changes in mRNA expression of numerous genes simultaneously. Because current genome-wide DNA array systems show a restricted sensitivity, we employed an Atlas 1.2 mouse array (BD Biosciences), which is a nylon membrane-based cDNA array, in combination with [α-32P]dATP-radiolabeled probes. Although exhibiting a high sensitivity, this system focuses on 1185 selected genes, most of them involved in basic cellular pathways. Ba/F3 cells expressing EGFR/EPOR hybrids were depleted of FCS and growth factors for 6 h and subsequently stimulated with 200 ng/ml EGF in the absence of FCS. Total RNA was extracted at different time points up to 8 h. Cellular responsivity and quality of RNA were verified by Northern blot analysis using a probe specific for murine bcl-x (data not shown). bcl-x was found to be transiently expressed, with the highest level at 2.5 h after EGF addition and a weak or no signal for the controls in the absence of EGF. Similar loading was verified by reprobing the blot with a probe for hprt. Next, poly(A)+ RNA was isolated and used to generate radiolabeled cDNAs, which were hybridized to Atlas 1.2 mouse cDNA arrays. Differences in mRNA expression profiles were determined by image analysis. To improve the accuracy and reproducibility of the method, both the numerical background subtraction and the normalization between different membranes were optimized. A grid of circles was aligned to the signal spots, and every circle was surrounded by a ring-shaped window, allowing a very accurate determination of the local background and leading to a significantly enhanced reproducibility. The correct alignment and quality of each spot were confirmed visually. Based on the raw local spot intensity and on the overall variance of background intensities, an individual noise threshold was calculated for every spot and used to flag a spot as present or absent. Before determining the signal ratios of corresponding spots of two membranes, it was crucial to define the intensity of absent spots as being equal to or less than the individual noise threshold. Thus, over- or underestimation of spots detected on only one of two compar"
