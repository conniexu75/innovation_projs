https://openalex.org/W2037688283,"The location of neurons generating the rhythm of breathing in mammals is unknown. By microsection of the neonatal rat brainstem in vitro, a limited region of the ventral medulla (the pre-Bötzinger Complex) that contains neurons essential for rhythmogenesis was identified. Rhythm generation was eliminated by removal of only this region. Medullary slices containing the pre-Bötzinger Complex generated respiratory-related oscillations similar to those generated by the whole brainstem in vitro, and neurons with voltage-dependent pacemaker-like properties were identified in this region. Thus, the respiratory rhythm in the mammalian neonatal nervous system may result from a population of conditional bursting pacemaker neurons in the pre-Bötzinger Complex."
https://openalex.org/W2071135527,"This study analyzes the function of the homeobox gene goosecoid in Xenopus development. First, we find that goosecoid mRNA distribution closely mimics the expected localization of organizer tissue in normal embryos as well as in those treated with LiCl and UV light. Second, goosecoid mRNA accumulation is induced by activin, even in the absence of protein synthesis. It is not affected by bFGF and is repressed by retinoic acid. Lastly, microinjection of goosecoid mRNA into the ventral side of Xenopus embryos, where goosecoid is normally absent, leads to the formation of an additional complete body axis, including head structures and abundant notochordal tissue. The results suggest that the goosecoid homeodomain protein plays a central role in executing Spemann's organizer phenomenon."
https://openalex.org/W2044117176,"Recombinant human platelet factor-4 (rhPF4), purified from Escherichia coli, inhibited blood vessel proliferation in the chicken chorioallantoic membrane in a dose-dependent manner. Treatment of several cell types with rhPF4 in vitro suggested that the angiostatic effect was due to specific inhibition of growth factor-stimulated endothelial cell proliferation. The inhibitory activities were associated with the carboxyl-terminal, heparin-binding region of the molecule and could be abrogated by including heparin in the test samples, an indication that sulfated polysaccharides might modulate the angiostatic activity of platelet factor-4 in vivo. Understanding of the mechanisms of control of angiogenesis by endogenous proteins should facilitate the development of effective treatments for diseases of pathogenic neovascularization such as Kaposi's sarcoma, diabetic retinopathy, and malignant tumor growth."
https://openalex.org/W2139103260,"Small eye (Sey) in mouse is a semidominant mutation which in the homozygous condition results in the complete lack of eyes and nasal primordia. On the basis of comparative mapping studies and on phenotypic similarities, Sey has been suggested to be homologous to congenital aniridia (lack of iris) in human. A candidate gene for the aniridia (AN) locus at 11p13 has been isolated by positional cloning and its sequence and that of the mouse homologue has been established (C.T., manuscript in preparation). This gene belongs to the paired-like class of developmental genes first described in Drosophila which contain two highly conserved motifs, the paired box and the homeobox. In vertebrates, genes which encode the single paired domain as well as those which express both motifs have been described as the Pax multigene family. A Pax gene recently described as Pax-6 is identical to the mouse homologue of the candidate aniridia gene. Here we report the analysis of three independent Sey alleles and show that indeed this gene is mutated and that the mutations would predictably interrupt gene function."
https://openalex.org/W2020215900,"Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and neurotrophin-3 (NT3) are homologs of the well-known neurotrophic factor nerve growth factor. The three members of this family display distinct patterns of target specificity. To examine the distribution in brain of messenger RNA for these molecules, in situ hybridization was performed. Cells hybridizing intensely to antisense BDNF probe were located throughout the major targets of the rat basal forebrain cholinergic system, that is, the hippocampus, amygdala, and neocortex. Strongly hybridizing cells were also observed in structures associated with the olfactory system. The distribution of NT3 mRNA in forebrain was much more limited. Within the hippocampus, labeled cells were restricted to CA2, the most medial portion of CA1, and the dentate gyrus. In human hippocampus, cells expressing BDNF mRNA are distributed in a fashion similar to that observed in the rat. These findings point to both basal forebrain cholinergic cells and olfactory pathways as potential central targets for BDNF."
https://openalex.org/W2048499136,"Longitudinal studies of patients infected with HIV-1 reveal a long and variable incubation period between infection and the development of AIDS. Data from a small number of infected patients show temporal changes in the number of genetically distinct strains of the virus throughout the incubation period, with a slow but steady rise in diversity during the progression to disease. A mathematical model of the dynamic interaction between viral diversity and the human immune system suggests the existence of an antigen diversity threshold, below which the immune system is able to regulate viral population growth but above which the virus population induces the collapse of the CD4+ lymphocyte population. The model suggests that antigenic diversity is the cause, not a consequence, of immunodeficiency disease. The model is compared with available data, and is used to assess how the timing of the application of chemotherapy or immunotherapy influences the rate of progress to disease."

https://openalex.org/W2048066878,"Gene expression stripes in Drosophila melanogaster embryos provide a model for how eukaryotic promoters are turned on and off in response to combinations of transcriptional regulators. Genetic studies suggested that even-skipped (eve) stripe 2 is controlled by three gap genes, hunchback (hb), Kruppel (Kr), and giant (gt), and by the maternal morphogen bicoid (bcd). A direct link is established between binding sites for these regulatory proteins in the stripe 2 promoter element and the expression of the stripe during early embryogenesis. The bcd and hb protein binding sites mediate activation, whereas neighboring gt and Kr protein sites repress expression and establish the stripe borders. The stripe 2 element has the properties of a genetic on-off switch."
https://openalex.org/W2060271381,"The murine white spotting locus (W) is allelic with the proto-oncogene c-kit, which encodes a transmembrane tyrosine protein kinase receptor for an unknown ligand. Mutations at the W locus affect various aspects of hematopoiesis and the proliferation and migration of primordial germ cells and melanoblasts during development to varying degrees of severity. The W42 mutation has a particularly severe effect in both the homozygous and the heterozygous states. The molecular basis of the W42 mutation was determined. The c-kit protein products in homozygous mutant mast cells were expressed normally but displayed a defective tyrosine kinase activity in vitro. Nucleotide sequence analysis of mutant complementary DNAs revealed a missense mutation that replaces aspartic acid with asparagine at position 790 in the c-kit protein product. Aspartic acid-790 is a conserved residue in all protein kinases. These results provide an explanation for the dominant nature of the W42 mutation and provide insight into the mechanism of c-kit-mediated signal transduction."
https://openalex.org/W1981067651,"HNF5, a liver-specific DNA-binding protein, interacts with DNA in a manner that allows DNAase I cleavage in the middle of its recognition sequence. Using this property we have identified in vivo HNF5 bound to its sites within two glucocorticoid-responsive units of the rat tyrosine aminotransferase (TAT) gene. One HNF5-binding site is also a glucocorticoid receptor-binding site; glucocorticoid-dependent HNF5 binding could be detected at this site even though it is incompatible with glucocorticoid receptor binding. HNF5 binds within 10 min of hormone addition, indicating that it participates in transcriptional activation. In the TAT gene glucocorticoid-dependent HNF5 binding occurs where there is glucocorticoid-dependent disruption of nucleosomal structure; constitutive binding occurs in constitutively disrupted regions. These results suggest a hit-and-run mechanism of transcriptional activation by glucocorticoid receptor: the activated receptor binds its target sequence, modifies local chromatin structure, then leaves its site accessible to another factor."

https://openalex.org/W1525154317,"The tyrosine kinase activity intrinsic to the insulin receptor is thought to be important in eliciting the intracellular responses to insulin; however, it has been difficult to determine the biochemical functions of the proteins which are substrates for this receptor. Treatment of Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells overexpressing the human insulin receptor (CHO.T) with insulin results in a 38 +/- 11 (mean +/- S.E., n = 9)-fold increase in a phosphatidylinositol (PtdIns) kinase activity in anti-phosphotyrosine immunoprecipitates of whole cell lysates. One minute of treatment of cells with insulin causes a dramatic increase in the PtdIns kinase activity in the anti-phosphotyrosine immunoprecipitates; the activity peaks within 5 min and remains elevated for at least 60 min after addition of insulin to the cells. This response is only slightly delayed compared with the time course we observe for activation of the insulin receptor tyrosine kinase. The insulin dose-response curves are also very similar for the activation of the insulin receptor tyrosine kinase activity and for the appearance of PtdIns kinase in the anti-phosphotyrosine immunoprecipitates. Stimulation of the endogenous insulin receptor of CHO cells also results in the association of PtdIns kinase activity with phosphotyrosine-containing proteins. However, CHO cells are less sensitive to insulin than CHO.T cells, and the maximal PtdIns kinase activity in antiphosphotyrosine immunoprecipitates from CHO cells is one-sixth that of CHO.T cells. In contrast, immunoprecipitates from CHO.T cells made with anti-insulin receptor antibodies do not contain significant levels of PtdIns kinase activity. This demonstrates that the PtdIns kinase is either a substrate for the insulin receptor tyrosine kinase or is tightly associated with another tyrosine phosphoprotein, which is not the insulin receptor."
https://openalex.org/W2088880312,"Desensitization at AMPA/kainate receptors has been proposed to contribute to the decay of excitatory synaptic currents. We examined the action of aniracetam, wheat germ agglutinin (WGA), and concanavalin A (Con A), drugs that act via separate mechanisms to reduce desensitization evoked by l-glutamate in rat hippocampal neurons. The decay of excitatory synaptic currents, and sucrose-evoked miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) was slowed 2- to 3-fold by aniracetam. In contrast, WGA increased the EPSC decay time constant only 1.3-fold and Con A had no effect. Aniracetam increased the magnitude of stimulus-evoked EPSCs 1.9-fold; variance analysis suggests a postsynaptic mechanism of action. WGA and Con A reduced EPSC amplitude via a presynaptic mechanism. Aniracetam increased the burst length of l-glutamate-activated single-channel responses. Simulations suggest that aniracetam either slows entry into a desensitized state or decreases the closing rate constant for ion channel gating."
https://openalex.org/W2038013843,"Oct-1 is a transcription factor involved in the cell cycle regulation of histone H2B gene transcription and in the transcription of other cellular housekeeping genes. Oct-1 is hyperphosphorylated as cells enter mitosis, and mitosis-specific phosphorylation is reversed as cells exit mitosis. A mitosis-specific phosphorylation site in the homeodomain of Oct-1 was phosphorylated in vitro by protein kinase A. Phosphorylation of this site correlated with inhibition of Oct-1 DNA binding activity in vivo and in vitro. The inhibition of Oct-1 DNA binding during mitosis suggests a mechanism by which the general inhibition of transcription during mitosis might occur."
https://openalex.org/W2064966625,"In primary dissociated cultures of mouse cerebellum a number of Purkinje cell-specific marker proteins and characteristic ionic currents appear at the appropriate developmental time. During the first week after plating, Purkinje cell dendrites elongate, but as electrical activity emerges the dendrites stop growing and branch. If endogenous electrical activity is inhibited by chronic tetrodotoxin or high magnesium treatment, dendrites continue to elongate, as if they were still immature. At the time that branching begins, intracellular calcium levels become sensitive to tetrodotoxin, suggesting that this cation may be involved in dendrite growth. Even apparently mature Purkinje cells alter their dendritic growth in response to changes in activity, suggesting long-term plasticity."
https://openalex.org/W1989197038,"To assess the necessary parameters for the growth of axons within the adult rat CNS, we have used intracerebral grafts of primary fibroblasts genetically engineered to express nerve growth factor (NGF). Following the implantation of NGF-producing primary fibroblasts within the striatum, cholinergic axons arising from the nucleus basalis grow toward and penetrate these grafts between 1 and 8 weeks. Grafts of noninfected control cells do not elicit axon sprouting at any time. Unmyelinated axons grow into grafts of NGF-producing cells only on reactive astrocytic processes, which contribute to a surrounding glial border. From our data concerning axon growth within the adult rat CNS, we conclude that reactive astrocytes can act as conducive substrates for growing axons; and only in the presence of elevated levels of NGF will permissive substrates (e.g., astrocytes) support axon growth by NGF-sensitive neurons."
https://openalex.org/W2062617918,"THE Sxr (sex-reversed) region, a fragment of the Y chromosome short arm, can cause chromosomally female XXSxr or XSxrO mice to develop as sterile males1–3. The original Sxr region, termed Sxra, encodes: Tdy, the primary sex-determining gene; Hya, the controlling or structural locus for the minor transplantation antigen H–Y (ref. 4); gene(s) controlling the expression of the serologically detected male antigen (SDMA)5; Spy, a gene(s) required for the survival and proliferation of A spermatogonia during spermatogenesis6,7; Zfy-l/Zfy-2, zinc-finger-containing genes of unknown function8; and Sry, which is probably identical to Tdy (ref. 9). A deletion variant10 of Sxra, termed Sxrb, which lacks Hya, SDMA expression, Spy and some Zfy-2 sequences, makes positional cloning of these genes possible. We report here the isolation of a new testis-specific gene, Sby, mapping to the DNA deleted from the Sxrb region (the ΔSxrb interval). Sby has extensive homology to the X-linked human ubiquitin-activating enzyme El (ref. 11). The critical role of this enzyme in nuclear DNA replication12 together with the testis-specific expression of Sby suggests Sby as a candidate for the spermatogenic gene Spy."
https://openalex.org/W2046030430,"Long-term potentiation (LTP) of synaptic transmission in the hippocampus is a robust form of synaptic plasticity that may contribute to mammalian memory formation. A variety of pharmacological evidence suggests that persistent kinase activation contributes to the maintenance of LTP. To determine whether persistent activation of protein kinases was associated with the maintenance phase of LTP, protein kinase activity was measured in control and LTP samples using exogenous protein kinase substrates in an in vitro assay of homogenates of the CA1 region of rat hippocampal slices. After LTP, protein kinase activity was persistently increased, and the induction of this effect was blocked by the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist DL-2-amino-5-phosphonovaleric acid. The increased protein kinase activity was found to be significantly attenuated by PKC(19-36), a selective peptide inhibitor of protein kinase C. Thus, LTP is associated with an N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor-mediated generation of a persistently activated form of protein kinase C. These data lend strong support to the model that persistent protein kinase activation contributes to the maintenance of LTP."
https://openalex.org/W1983067916,"After antigenic stimulation of T lymphocytes, genes essential for proliferation and immune function, such as the interleukin-2 (IL-2) gene, are transcriptionally activated. In both transient transfections and T lymphocyte-specific in vitro transcription, the homeodomain-containing protein Oct-1 participated in the inducible regulation of transcription of the IL-2 gene. Oct-1 functioned in this context with a 40-kilodalton protein called Oct-1-associated protein (OAP40). In addition to interacting specifically with DNA, OAP40 reduced the rate of dissociation of Oct-1 from its cognate DNA-binding site, suggesting that a direct interaction exists between Oct-1 and OAP40."
https://openalex.org/W1596624275,"R-factor mediated bacterial resistance to arsenical salts occurs by active extrusion of the toxic oxyanions from cells of gram negative bacteria. The ars operon of the conjugative plasmid R773 encodes an anion pump. The pump has two polypeptide components. The catalytic subunit, the ArsA protein, is an oxyanion-stimulated ATPase. The membrane component, the ArsB protein, has been localized in the inner membrane of Escherichia coli. The ArsA and ArsB proteins have been postulated to form a membrane complex which functions as an anion-translocating ATPase. In this study evidence is presented showing that expression of the arsB gene is required to anchor the ArsA protein to the inner membrane. Binding studies with purified ArsA to membranes with and without the arsB gene product confirm this requirement. Membranes of uncA mutants containing both the ArsA and ArsB proteins exhibit arsenite(antimonite)-stimulated ATPase activity. These results support the model in which the ArsA protein is the catalytic energy transducing component of the anion pump, whereas the integral membrane ArsB protein serves as both the anion channel and membrane binding site for the ArsA protein."
https://openalex.org/W1604410629,"Bacterial expression of apolipoprotein (apo) B cDNA constructs has been used to map a series of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) to apoB by immunoblotting. In some cases assignments have been confirmed and refined by (i) semipurification of expressed protein, CNBr digestion, and assignment of the immunoreactive fragments; (ii) controlled digestion of the cDNA with the exonuclease Bal31 and bacterial expression of the truncated proteins that result; or (iii) expression of specific segments of cDNA amplified by the polymerase chain reaction. Forty mAbs were mapped to a minimum of 17 separate determinants on apoB. Tryptic fragments have been used to confirm the epitope assignments. In addition, this approach in conjunction with immunoassay, enables some deductions to be made about the trypsin-accessible regions in low density lipoprotein (LDL). The cleavage pattern obtained predicts retention of structure in the cysteine-rich domain of the amino terminus and also in the LDL receptor binding region. Trypsinized LDL was shown to bind to the LDL receptor by an authentic process, using monoclonal antibodies as competing ligands. In conjunction with the previous paper (Milne, R. W., Theolis, R., Maurice, R., Pease, R. J., Weech, P. K., Rassart, E., Fruchart, J.-C., Scott, J., and Marcel, Y. L. (1989) J. Biol.

https://openalex.org/W1516392471,"A novel 28,000 Mr serine protease, designated mouse mast cell protease-2 (MMCP-2), that is stored in the secretory granules of Kirsten sarcoma virus-immortalized mouse mast cells (KiSV-MC) has been identified and its NH2-terminal amino acid sequence has been determined. Analysis of a 953-base pair cDNA that encodes MMCP-2 revealed that this serine protease is a basically charged protein, possessing the histidine-aspartic acid-serine charge relay system that is characteristic of other serine proteases. DNA blot analysis using the full-length MMCP-2 cDNA indicated the existence of a family of highly related serine protease genes in the mouse genome. When the same DNA blot was probed with the 149-base pair KpnI----3' fragment of the cDNA, the probe hybridized to a single DNA fragment, thereby demonstrating that this 3' fragment could be used as a gene-specific probe. The presence of high levels of the MMCP-2 mRNA transcript in the intestines of nematode-infected mice, and its absence in mouse bone marrow-derived mast cells and peritoneal cavity-derived connective tissue mast cells, suggest that this member of the mouse mast cell protease family is preferentially expressed late in the differentiation of mucosal mast cells."
https://openalex.org/W2043079388,"The proposition that free radicals may be an important factor in aging remains to be rigorously proven; but the presence of increased amounts of oxidized proteins in aging biological systems supports the notion. The results of new experiments in Mongolian gerbils indicate that the accumulation of oxidatively damaged proteins during aging may be a cause of behavioral deficits in aging experimental animals and that this chronic oxidation may be reversible with compounds that react with and stabilize free radicals. PBN (N-tert-butyl-{alpha}-phenyl nitrone), a spin-trapping compound, reacts with free radicals and yields a stable nitroxyl product. PBN offers protection from, and traps free radicals during, ischemia-reperfusion-mediated injury to heart and brain of experimental animals. Daily administration of PBN to old gerbils causes a decrease in the amount of oxidized protein and an increase in both glutamine synthetase and neutral protease activity in brain, as well as a decrease in the number of errors made in the radial-arm maze test for memory. In other words, PBN administration reversed the chemical and behavioral parameters of the older gerbils to nearly those values observed in the younger gerbils. Furthermore, after cessation of PBN administration, the amount of both oxidized protein as well as glutaminemore » synthetase and neutral protease activities gradually returned to the values found in normal, older gerbils. PBN did not have these effects in young gerbils.« less"
https://openalex.org/W2011699726,"The autoantigen La, a known transcription termination factor of RNA polymerase III, was purified to homogeneity from mouse 3T3 cells and calf thymus by different isolation procedures. The La protein from calf thymus was separated into RNA binding and nonbinding subclasses. The murine La protein and the RNA binding subclass of calf thymus La protein showed ATPase/dATPase activity in the presence of DNA-RNA or RNA-RNA hybrids. A novel monoclonal anti-La antibody (La11G7) and patients' anti-La antibodies immunoadsorbed to homogeneously purified La protein were able to inhibit the enzyme activity of La protein. La protein was able to melt a synthetic DNA-RNA hybrid in a reaction that required ATP hydrolysis. The RNA binding ability of the nonbinding subclass was restored by treatment with sialidase. This treatment also restored the protein's ATP-dependent melting activity."
https://openalex.org/W1573552069,"Growth hormone (GH) may directly affect the expression of some liver cytochromes P-450 inducible by xenobiotics, but this has been difficult to establish with pituitary ablation in living animals. Therefore, we incubated adult rat hepatocytes on a laminin-rich matrix, matrigel, a new system that permits hepatocytes to respond to xenobiotics with induction of the microsomal hemoproteins, the cytochromes P-450, in culture as they do in the intact liver (Schuetz, E. G., Li, D., Omiecinski, C. J., Muller-Eberhard, U., Kleinman, H. K., Elswick, B., and Guzelian, P. S. (1988) J. Cell. Physiol. 134, 309-323). Indeed, when cultures were treated with phenobarbital, there was a rise in mRNAs for the cytochromes P-450b/e and P-450p accompanied by a rise in mRNA for 5-aminolevulinate synthase, the rate-limiting enzyme in heme biosynthesis. Analysis of nuclei from the matrigel cultures established that phenobarbital treatment had activated transcription of the P-450b/e gene. Co-incubation of the cultures with physiologic concentrations of growth hormone completely blocked the induction of these P-450 mRNAs and partially blocked the rise in 5-aminolevulinate synthase mRNA. Induction of P-450p by isosafrole also was inhibited strongly by GH, whereas P-450p induction by pregnenolone 16 alpha-carbonitrile or dexamethasone was affected only weakly by GH. The effect of GH was specific inasmuch as phenobarbital-inducible expression of P-450 reductase, glucocorticoid-inducible expression of tyrosine aminotransferase, and basal expression of albumin were unaffected by the presence or absence of growth hormone. Nuclear analysis revealed that growth hormone inhibited phenobarbital-induced P-450b/e gene transcription, whereas the hormone was without effect on transcription of the liver-specific gene, tyrosine aminotransferase. In contrast, the addition of another peptide hormone, insulin-like growth factor I, was without inhibitory effect on P-450 gene expression. We conclude that growth hormone acts specifically and selectively in direct contact with the hepatocyte to control xenobiotic induction of some liver drug-metabolizing enzymes."
https://openalex.org/W1546164822,"To determine the role of protein phosphorylation in neutrophil activation, electropermeabilized cells were treated with vanadate, a phosphatase inhibitor. Micromolar concentrations of vanadate elicited a NADPH-dependent burst of oxygen utilization in permeabilized, but not in intact cells, indicating an intracellular site of action. Stimulation of oxygen consumption by vanadate was reversible, concentration dependent and required the presence of ATP and Mg2+. Generation of a respiratory burst by vanadate was associated with accumulation of phosphorylated proteins. Such accumulation was due, at least in part, to inhibition of phosphoprotein phosphatase activity, as indicated by pulse-chase experiments. No evidence for stimulation of protein kinases by vanadate was found. Phosphoamino acid analysis revealed that a large fraction of the vanadate-induced phosphorylation occurred on tyrosine residues. The pronounced accumulation of tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins was confirmed by immunoblotting with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies. The data suggest that neutrophils possess one or more constitutively active tyrosine kinases and that phosphoprotein accumulation is normally prevented by vigorous concomitant phosphatase activity. Inhibition of the latter by vanadate leads to phosphoprotein accumulation and is accompanied by stimulation of oxygen consumption."
https://openalex.org/W1666898681,"Interleukin 1 or tumor necrosis factor alpha can cause a transient down-modulation of epidermal growth factor (EGF) binding to quiescent fibroblast monolayers; the effect results from a reduction in EGF receptor (EGF-R) affinity and appears to be mediated by a protein kinase C (PKC)-independent mechanism. Here we show transient increases in EGF-R serine/threonine phosphorylation which are temporally coordinated with the effects on EGF binding; we also demonstrate that the cytokine-mediated phosphorylations, unlike those caused by PKC activators, have little discernible effect upon intrinsic EGF-R-associated tyrosine kinase activity. Cytokine-mediated EGF-R phosphorylation is resistant to staurosporine, an extremely potent inhibitor of PKC. Analysis of tryptic 32P-phosphopeptides reveals that Thr654, the unique site of PKC-mediated phosphorylation, is not phosphorylated in cytokine-treated cells, but a different, relatively acidic, peptide containing phosphoserine can be detected instead."
https://openalex.org/W1495650014,"The vitronectin receptor (VnR) is one member of a subset of cell adhesion receptors within the integrin supergene family which shares the beta 3 subunit (IIIa). We show here that the VnR is absent from the surface of monocytes freshly isolated from blood but is expressed on these cells after a period of in vitro culture. Such cultured monocytes (macrophages) from a patient with type I Glanzmann's thrombasthenia, however, failed to express the VnR. Instead, immunoprecipitation with a monoclonal antibody directed to the VnR alpha chain (alpha v) revealed a novel integrin comprising alpha v associated noncovalently with a 100-kDa beta subunit (beta 3b), immunologically unrelated to the VnR beta subunit (beta 3a). This same novel integrin complex was also identified on 10-day-old macrophages from healthy donors, but on these cells, the beta 3b subunit was co-expressed with the classical VnR complex of alpha v beta 3a. The novel beta 3b subunit was not identified by monoclonal or polyclonal antibodies to IIIa (beta 3a) nor by a monoclonal antibody to the classical VnR complex. The beta 3b subunit could be distinguished from beta 3a by its relatively greater migration on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis after reduction, by its distinct isoelectric point upon two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, and by one-dimensional peptide mapping. Neither platelets nor B lymphoblasts from this patient with Glanzmann's thrombasthenia expressed any VnR on their surface, whereas control cells from a normal donor expressed the classical VnR but not the beta 3b subunit. The two beta chains, and hence also the combined receptor complexes, appeared to be differentially regulated. These findings provide the first example of an integrin alpha chain complexed with more than a single beta chain in the same cell. Furthermore, the differential regulation of expression of the different beta subunits that associate with the VnR alpha chain on cultured monocytes suggests a role for the novel receptor complex during monocyte/macrophage differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W1547990180,"Insulin and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha) produce potent and opposing physiological signals in adipocytes. However, genes that are co-regulated by the hormone and cytokine during and after adipocyte differentiation have not been characterized. Using 3T3-L1 cells, we have studied the regulation of the expression of genes encoding acyl-CoA synthetase (ACS), and stearoyl CoA desaturase-1 (SCD-1), two enzymes that play key roles in the metabolism of long chain fatty acids. Insulin is required for triggering the transcriptional activation of the ACS and SCD-1 genes at an early stage in adipocyte differentiation. In mature adipocytes insulin elicits a 4-fold increase in the rates of transcription of the two genes. However, when 3T3-L1 adipocytes are treated with TNF alpha the cytokine causes a 75-90% decrease in the levels of ACS and SCD-1 mRNAs. The decline in mRNA content is associated with similar decrements in the rates of transcription of the ACS and SCD-1 genes. Thus, the ACS and SCD-1 genes are subject to stimulation and counter-regulation (at the transcriptional level) by insulin and TNF alpha, respectively. The opposing effects of insulin and TNF alpha are observed in developing and terminally differentiated adipocytes. Unlike the ACS and SCD-1 genes, the genes that encode the lipogenic enzymes lipoprotein lipase and malic enzyme are not subject to counter-regulation by insulin and TNF alpha at the transcriptional level in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. These observations on the control of ACS and SCD-1 expression suggest possible mechanisms by which adipocytes can markedly adjust their capacity for long chain fatty acid metabolism in response to external stimuli."
https://openalex.org/W1870581536,"Sympathetic nerves and catecholamines exert growth-promoting trophic influences on arterial smooth muscle in vivo, but the molecular signals mediating these trophic effects are unknown. We report here that the alpha-adrenergic agonist phenylephrine (PE) produced dose-dependent stimulation of platelet-derived growth factor A-chain (PDGF-A) gene expression in rat thoracic aorta via agonist occupancy of alpha 1-adrenergic receptors. Increases in aortic PDGF-A mRNA levels were rapid (maximal at 6 h, 10-fold) and transient. Among seven different tissues studied, PE evoked significant increases in PDGF-A mRNA levels only in the aorta. When periaortic fatty/connective tissues normally adherent to thoracic aorta were examined separately from the remaining aortic vessel wall (endothelium removed), stimulated PDGF-A gene expression was found only in vessel wall (presumably smooth muscle). The physiological alpha-adrenergic agonist norepinephrine also increased aortic PDGF-A mRNA levels. Angiotensin II or endothelin, despite producing blood pressure increases similar to PE, had little or no effect on PDGF-A mRNA abundance in rat aorta. PE-stimulated PDGF-A gene expression was accompanied by increased expression of other growth-related genes including c-fos, c-myc, and ornithine decarboxylase but not DNA synthesis. These results suggest a mechanism for previously described trophic effects of sympathetic nerves and catecholamines on arterial smooth muscle mass, i.e. regulation of growth-related gene expression via alpha 1-adrenergic receptors."
https://openalex.org/W1540257390,"The precursor of pulmonary surfactant-associated protein, SP-B, is composed of an NH2-terminal domain of 30 residues (a-type domain) and three tandem repeats of about 90 residues (b-type domain); biophysically active mature SP-B corresponds to the second b-type repeat. Consensus sequences constructed for the b-type repeats were used to search the data base for homologous sequences, and the search has revealed that prosaposin and sulfated glycoprotein 1 show a remarkable homology with these repeats. The domain organizations of the latter proteins, however, differ from that of SP-B precursor inasmuch as they contain four tandem copies of the b-type domain and a-type domains are present both in the NH2-terminal and COOH-terminal parts of the proteins. The implications of the homology of saposins and SP-B for their structure and function are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1594528239,"Mice were immunized against ribosomal acidic proteins P1 and P2 from Artemia salina, and three kinds of monoclonal antibodies were isolated. One recognized P0 in addition to both P1 and P2 (anti-P). The other two recognized either P1 (anti-P1) or P2 (anti-P2) specifically and did not recognize P0. The anti-P antibody, but not anti-P1 or anti-P2, recognized a 22-amino acid peptide corresponding to the carboxyl-terminal sequence common to P1 and P2. This antibody, but not the others, inhibited poly(U)-directed polyphenylalanine synthesis. The anti-P1 bound to ribosomes but failed to inhibit polyphenylalanine synthesis: the anti-P2 did not bind to ribosomes at all. The anti-P and its Fab fragments inhibited the elongation step of protein synthesis, namely, the binding of elongation factors 1 alpha and 2 to ribosomes as well as their ribosome-coupled GTPase activities. Anti-P had little effect on the nonenzymatic phenylalanyl-tRNA binding to ribosomes and on peptidyltransferase activity. These results suggest the functional importance of the homologous carboxyl-terminal region of the three P proteins for the interaction of the ribosome with the two elongation factors. The epitope of anti-P1 must reside in a region of the protein which is not directly involved in its function."
https://openalex.org/W1579258114,"Binding of epidermal growth factor (EGF) to cell surface EGF receptors initiates the formation of the receptor homodimers that can be detected by covalent cross-linking in intact cells or in detergent-solubilized cell extracts. Low pH dissociation of EGF from surface receptors results in immediate monomerization of receptor dimers. Using chemical cross-linking during mild permeabilization or cell solubilization, we have detected dimers of internalized EGF receptors in human carcinoma A-431 cells and transfected NIH 3T3 cells that express human EGF receptors. The percentage of internalized cross-linked receptor dimers was similar to that observed for surface EGF receptors. Furthermore, at the time of maximal accumulation of EGF-receptor complexes within the endosomal compartment (10-15 min of incubation at 37 degrees C), both the dimeric and monomeric forms of the EGF receptor are tyrosine-phosphorylated to the same extent as surface dimer and monomer species. In transfected NIH 3T3 cells, the level of dimerized and internalized kinase-negative EGF receptors was not different from that observed for wild-type receptors. These data suggest that for some time after internalization EGF does not dissociate from its receptor and indicate that a receptor conformation is preserved intracellularly that allows maintenance of receptor-receptor interactions and tyrosine kinase activity."
https://openalex.org/W1545352657,"The glycine decarboxylase multienzyme complex is located in the mitochondrial matrix and catalyzes a key reaction of the photorespiratory C-2 cycle of C3 plants. The cDNA encoding the smallest subunit, the 13,900-dalton H-protein, of the glycine decarboxylase complex from pea (Pisum sativum) leaves was cloned, identified, characterized, and sequenced. The 678-nucleotide sequence contained a 495-nucleotide open reading frame capable of encoding the 165-amino-acid H-protein precursor. The N terminus of this protein contains a 34-amino-acid sequence which does not appear in the mature protein. This presequence resembles the amphiphilic helices observed with mitochondrial leader sequences in yeast. The 131-amino-acid mature protein from peas shares substantial homology with the enzyme isolated from chicken liver. The abundance of the H-protein mRNA was about 5-fold greater in light-grown pea seedlings compared to dark-grown seedlings. The amount of H-protein transcript increased within 4 h after the plants were transferred to white light and continued to increase up to 24 h. The time course for the accumulation of the H-protein mRNA was similar to that for the mRNA of the small subunit of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase."
https://openalex.org/W1631704733,"In Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells, apical and basolateral membrane proteins are segregated from each other in the trans-Golgi network (TGN) and are transported to the appropriate membrane domain via separate vesicle populations. In hepatocytes, however, all plasma membrane proteins are delivered basolaterally. Apical proteins are then selectively retrieved and reach the apical surface by transcytosis. The sorting of apical proteins in different cell types may be the result of differences in the cellular sorting machinery, or alternatively, due to expression of cell-specific sorting signals on the proteins themselves. To test this directly, we have stably expressed cDNA encoding an apical protein from rat liver, dipeptidylpeptidase IV (DPPIV), in MDCK cells. We found that approximately 90% of the exogenous DPPIV is expressed on the apical cell surface at steady state. Furthermore, we demonstrate that this distribution is primarily due to vectorial transport from the TGN to the apical plasma membrane. The small pool of mis-sorted DPPIV that appears basolaterally is slowly endocytosed (t1/2 approximately 60 min) and is subsequently transcytosed. These data are consistent with the notion that both hepatocytes and MDCK cells are capable of correctly sorting rat liver DPPIV, but that this sorting occurs at different sites in the two cell types."
https://openalex.org/W1532921926,"The cis-acting element mediating glucocorticoid inducibility of the chicken glutamine synthetase gene has been identified. Transfection studies using intact embryonic chicken retinae and L6 myoblasts demonstrate that sequences located between 1,849 and 2,120 nucleotides upstream of the glutamine synthetase transcription start site are required to achieve hormonally inducible expression of the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene. Moreover, a 42-nucleotide fragment from this region provides a robust hormonal induction when positioned approximately 2 kilobases from the SV40 early promoter. A sequence containing 8 nucleotides in common with the 12-nucleotide consensus glucocorticoid response element is encoded within this element. DNase I footprinting experiments confirm that this consensus sequence provides the only binding sites for the glucocorticoid receptor within the DNA required for inducibility. Removal of 8 nucleotides that map outside of the footprinting region results in attenuation of the hormonal response in L6 myoblasts and abolition of the response in embryonic retinae. This deletion eliminates the sequence 5'CAGCGTCA3', a sequence that resembles the canonical cyclic AMP response element (CRE), activating transcription factor (ATF), and AP1 binding sites. These results suggest that the glucocorticoid receptor acts in collaboration with a member of the jun/fos/ATF/CREB family of transcription factors to mediate a strong glucocorticoid induction at a site 2.1 kilobases upstream of the glutamine synthetase transcription start site."
https://openalex.org/W1554141309,"Differential regulation of the regulatory subunits of cAMP-dependent protein kinase isozymes correlates with the growth inhibitory effect of site-selective 8-Cl-cAMP demonstrated in cancer cell lines (Ally, S., Tortora, G., Clair, T., Grieco, D., Merlo, G., Katsaros, D., Ogreid, D., Doskeland, S.O., Jahnsen, T., and Cho-Chung, Y.S. (1988) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 85, 6319-6322). Such selective modulation of protein kinase isozyme regulatory subunits was also found in the 8-Cl-cAMP-induced inhibition of both transformation and transforming growth factor alpha (TGF alpha) production in Ki-ras-transformed rat kidney fibroblasts (Tortora, G., Ciardiello, F., Ally, S., Clair, T., Salomon, D. S., and Cho-Chung, Y. S. (1989) FEBS Lett. 242, 363-367). In this work, we have demonstrated that 8-Cl-cAMP antagonizes the TGF alpha effect in TGF alpha-transformed mouse mammary epithelial cells (NOG-8TFC17) at the level of gene expression for cAMP receptor protein isoforms, RI and RII (the regulatory subunits of protein kinase isozymes). Northern blot analysis demonstrated that in the transformed NOG-8TFC17 cells, compared with the nontransformed counterpart NOG-8 cells, the mRNA levels for the RI alpha cAMP receptor protein markedly increased, whereas the mRNA levels for the RII alpha and RII beta cAMP receptor proteins decreased. 8-Cl-cAMP, which induced growth inhibition and phenotypic reversion in NOG-8TFC17 cells, caused an inverse change in the mRNA patterns of the cAMP receptor proteins; RI alpha cAMP receptor mRNA sharply decreased to levels comparable with that of the nontransformed NOG-8 cells, whereas RII beta mRNA increased to a level even greater than that in the NOG-8 cells. In addition, one mRNA species of RII alpha increased, whereas the other RII alpha mRNA species decreased during the treatment. The mRNA level for the catalytic subunit of protein kinase, however, did not change during 8-Cl-cAMP treatment. In addition, 8-Cl-cAMP brought about a reduction in both TGF alpha mRNA and protein levels. These coordinated changes in the expression of the cAMP receptor proteins and TGF alpha were not observed during cis-hydroxyprolineor TGF beta-induced growth inhibition of the NOG-8TFC17 cells. Thus, the antagonistic effect of 8-Cl-cAMP toward TGF alpha-induced transformation involves modulation of the expression of a specific set of cellular genes."
https://openalex.org/W1506225548,"To better understand the tissue-specific expression of the human apolipoprotein (apo)AI gene, we performed a detailed analysis of the pattern of methylation of the gene in various human adult and embryonic tissues and in tissues of transgenic mice harboring the human apo-AI gene. In addition, the gene was analyzed also in liver and intestine-derived human cell lines (HepG2 and Caco2, respectively). Using methyl-sensitive restriction enzymes (HpaII, HhaI, and SmaI) and the appropriate radioactive probes, we were able to determine separately the status of methylation of the 5'-end, the body of the gene, and 3'-end flanking sequences. The apo-AI gene in tissues that express the gene was undermethylated at the 5'-end. However, the 5'-end of the gene in sperm and in all adult tissues that do not express the gene was heavily methylated. The body of the gene which contains a CpG island and the 3'-end flanking sequences were, in general, hypomethylated except for specific sites that showed partial methylation. In contrast, while the gene showed tissue-specific expression already in a 12-week-old embryo, the 5'-end was invariably hypomethylated in all tissues of the embryo. A human apo-AI transgene has recently been shown to be active exclusively in the liver, while the endogenous gene is expressed in both liver and intestine (6). We show here that the 5'-end of the apo-AI transgene was methylated in all tissues of the mouse (including intestine) except liver. The results presented here demonstrate a clear correlation between hypomethylation of the 5'-end and activity of the apo-AI gene. However, the observed methylation pattern of the gene in embryonic tissues suggests that tissue-specific expression precedes formation of the tissue-specific methylation pattern."

To elucidate the mechanism of insertion of selenium into Ge-GSH-Px further, we have systematically analyzed and compared the results of Western blot, in vitro translation immunoprecipitation, and Northern blot experiments conducted with liver proteins and RNAs obtained from rats fed on selenium-deficient and selenium-supplemented diets. The anti-serum employed in this study was raised against an electrophoretically pure Se-GSH-Px preparation obtained from rat livers by a simplified purification procedure involving separation by high performance liquid chromatography on a hydrophobic interaction column. Different forms of Se-GSH-Px, including apo-protein, cross-reacted with this antiserum and Western blot analysis found no Se-GSH-Px protein present in livers from rats fed on selenium-deficient diets. By contrast, a distinct protein band corresponding to purified Se-GSH-Px was detected in livers from selenium-supplemented animals, a result consistent with the finding that the Se-GSH-Px activity was reduced to undetectable levels in livers of selenium-deficient rats. The in vitro translation experiments, however, indicated not only that mRNA for Se-GSH-Px was present during selenium deficiency but also that its translation products contained 2-3-fold as much immunoprecipitable protein as the products of poly(A) RNA from livers of selenium-supplemented rats. This result suggests that the Se-GSH-Px mRNA may be increased in the selenium-deficient state. Elevated levels of Se-GSH-Px mRNA were directly demonstrated in Northern blot experiments employing cDNA clone pGPX1211 as a probe. A similar increase in Se-GSH-Px mRNA was observed in such other tissues as kidney, testis, brain, and lung tissue, in selenium-deficient states. The present data support the co-translational mechanism for the incorporation of selenium into Se-GSH-Px in rat liver."

https://openalex.org/W1529308217,"Newly transcribed small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs) appear transiently in the cytoplasm where they assemble with snRNP core proteins (B, D, E, F, and G) stored in large pools of snRNA-free intermediates before returning permanently to the nucleus. In this report, the cytoplasmic assembly of snRNP core particles in L929 mouse fibroblasts was investigated by kinetic analysis of assembly intermediates resolved on sucrose gradients. Immunoprecipitation of gradient fractions with anti-snRNP autoimmune antisera identify pools of 6 and 20 S snRNA-free snRNP protein intermediates. The snRNP B protein has a heterodisperse sedimentation from 4 to 20 S with peaks at 6 and 20 S, and the snRNP D protein is in a bimodal distribution at 6 and 20 S. At 6 S the D protein is assembled with the E, F, and G proteins into a RNA-free core particle with a stoichiometry of D4EFG. SnRNP assembly proceeds by snRNA assembling initially with the 6 S D4EFG particle and then two copies of the B protein to form an 11-15 S SnRNP particle. The 20 S forms of the D protein in the cytoplasm are less stable than the 6 S D4EFG particle. The U1-specific A and C proteins leak from isolated nuclei and appear in the cytoplasmic fractions where they sediment from 10 to 20 S and from 4 to 8 S, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W1530358290,"The biosynthetic enzyme peptidylglycine alpha-amidating monooxygenase catalyzes the formation of a variety of biologically active alpha-amidated peptides from respective COOH-terminal glycine-extended peptide precursors. Peptidylglycine alpha-amidating monooxygenase activity is dependent on copper, ascorbate, and molecular oxygen and is inhibited by the relatively selective copper chelator N,N-diethyldithiocarbamate or its disulfide dimer disulfiram (Antabuse). In the present study, chronic disulfiram treatment (100 mg/kg/day, for 12-25 days) resulted in significant changes in several neurochemical parameters in the mouse central nervous system, including levels of substance P-like, unamidated substance P-Gly-like, and protease-generated substance P-Gly-Lys-like immunoreactivities (SP-LI, SP-G-LI, and SP-G-K-LI, respectively). Combined high performance liquid chromatography/radioimmunoassay analyses of the extracted SP-LI, SP-G-LI, and SP-G-K-LI species indicated very similar chromatographic and immunochemical behavior as demonstrated for chemically authentic peptide standards. Additionally, changes in levels of monoamines and their metabolites were observed after drug administration. Complementary immunohistochemical analyses using affinity-purified anti-SP-G sera localized these drug-induced changes in levels of immunoreactive unamidated precursor to neural elements that normally express SP. As a functional corollary to alterations in neurochemical parameters, we observed significant disulfiram-induced increases in pain thresholds, potentiated by capsaicin treatment. Overall, our results indicate that the observed changes in steady state levels of immunoreactive SP and of the immature COOH-terminal extended forms of SP may reflect compensatory biosynthetic and posttranslational processing events in SP-containing neural systems after pharmacological challenge."
https://openalex.org/W1481757365,"The malignant trophoblastic cell line JAR was used as a model system to study protein folding in intact cells. We have used this model previously to identify conformational intermediates in the production of an assembly-competent form of the human chorionic gonadotropin beta subunit (Ruddon, R. W., Krzesicki, R. F., Norton, S. E., Beebe, J. S., Peters, B. P., and Perini, F. (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 12533-12540). The earliest biosynthetic precursor of the human chorionic gonadotropin beta subunit detectable in JAR cells pulse labeled for 2 min is p beta 1, a form that lacks half of the six intrachain disulfide bonds observed in the fully processed dimer form of beta and that does not combine with the alpha subunit. p beta 1 is rapidly (t1/2 approximately 4 min) converted into p beta 2, which has a full complement of intrachain disulfide bonds and does combine with the alpha subunit. In this study, we have identified the three late forming disulfide bonds involved in the transition of p beta 1 into the assembly-compete form, p beta 2. The last three disulfide bonds to form are those between cysteines 9 and 90, 23 and 72, and 93 and 100. These were identified in JAR cell lysates that had been pulse labeled with [35S]cysteine for 2 or 5 min followed by trapping of the cysteine thiols with iodoacetic acid before immunopurification of the beta subunit forms. Immunopurified p beta 1 was treated with trypsin under nonreducing conditions to liberate [35S]cysteine-containing peptides from the disulfide-linked beta core polypeptide. These tryptic peptides were then separated by high performance liquid chromatography and sequenced to determine the location of the carboxymethyl-[35S]cysteine residues. The three late forming disulfide bonds are most likely the ones involved in stabilizing the conformation of the beta subunit that is required for combination with alpha to form the biologically functional alpha beta heterodimer."
https://openalex.org/W1596231960,"We have isolated cDNA clones for bovine dopamine beta-hydroxylase from an adrenal medulla cDNA library and have determined the complete coding sequence. The largest cDNA clone isolated from the library is 2.4 kilobase pairs (kb) and contains an open reading frame of 1788 bases, coding for a protein of 597 amino acids and Mr = 66,803. The predicted amino acid sequence of the bovine cDNA contains 85% identity with human dopamine beta-hydroxylase (Lamouroux, A., Vingny, A., Faucon Biquet, N., Darmon, M. C., Franck, R., Henry, J.P., and Mallet, J. (1987) EMBO J. 6, 3931-3937; Kobayashi, K., Kurosawa, Y., Fujita, K., and Nagatsu, T. (1989) Nucleic Acids Res. 17, 1089-1102). Northern blot analysis reveals that the cDNA hybridizes to an mRNA of 2.4 kb present in bovine adrenal medulla, but not in kidney, heart, or liver. In addition, the cDNA hybridizes to a second RNA species of 5.5 kb, which is 4-fold less abundant than the 2.4-kb RNA. In vitro translation of a synthetic RNA transcribed from the 2.4-kb cDNA produces a 68-kDa protein, which is specifically immunoprecipitated by antiserum to bovine dopamine beta-hydroxylase. The 2.4-kb cDNA was cloned into a vaccinia virus vector, and the recombinant virus was used to infect the rat pheochromocytoma PC12 and monkey BSC-40 fibroblast cell lines. In both cell lines, infection with recombinant virus produces a protein of Mr = 75,000, which reacts with antiserum to bovine dopamine beta-hydroxylase. These results indicate that the 2.4-kb cDNA contains the genetic information necessary to code for the bovine dopamine beta-hydroxylase subunit."
https://openalex.org/W1568475026,"Analysis of the binding of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) by Torpedo nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (AChR) has demonstrated that a region of the alpha-subunit between alpha-156 and alpha-179 is exposed on the cytoplasmic surface of the nicotinic post-synaptic membrane. A panel of mAbs was produced that recognized sodium dodecyl sulfate-denatured subunits of the Torpedo AChR. Antibodies recognizing alpha-subunit were distinguished in terms of their ability to bind alpha-subunit fragments generated by Staphylococcus aureus V8 protease: an 18-kDa fragment beginning at Val-46, a 20-kDa fragment beginning at Ser-173/Ser-162, and a 10 kDa fragment beginning at Asn-339. Three mAbs, selected for binding to each of the V8-protease alpha-subunit fragments, respectively, were characterized in detail. The location of epitopes recognized by both anti-V8-18 and anti-V8-20 mAbs was determined to be within alpha-156 to alpha-179 by isolation of small immunoreactive peptides from proteolytic digests of the alpha-subunit, while the mAb reactive to V8-10 was bound to an epitope within alpha-339 to alpha-386. Quantitative evaluation of binding of the anti-V8-18 and anti-V8-20 mAbs to overlapping synthetic peptides corresponding to alpha-147 to alpha-179 localized the epitopes to distinct portions of this region. Further screening of the panel of mAbs using these synthetic peptides revealed three additional mAbs that bind in this region. The mAbs that bound the three distinct V8-protease alpha-subunit fragments were shown to bind to native AChR by indirect immunofluorescence on frozen sections of Torpedo electric organ. Binding to the native AChR was to the cytoplasmic surface of the AChR since the mAbs could bind to AChR in native vesicles, in which the AChR is oriented right-side-out, only after permeabilization of the vesicles by alkaline treatment or after scrambling of the orientation of the AChR by solubilization and reconstitution into liposomes. The location of the mAb-binding sites at the cytoplasmic surface of the AChR was visualized directly by freeze-etch immunoelectron microscopy. The identification of alpha-156 and alpha-179 as containing a cytoplasmic exposed sequence implies the existence of two non-hydrophobic transmembrane sequences between the site of N-glycosylation (Asn-141) and Cys-192, a site alkylated by the cholinergic affinity labels."
https://openalex.org/W1538308671,"The HER2 (c-erbB-2) gene encodes a protein, p185HER2, which possesses all of the structural characteristics and functional properties of a growth factor receptor, although its ligand has not yet been well characterized. HER2 is the human homolog of the rat proto-oncogene neu and is closely related to the gene encoding the epidermal growth factor receptor. Amplification of this gene and overexpression have been found to be a prognostic criterion for a 30% subpopulation of human breast cancer patients. In this study, we investigated the role of the transmembrane-spanning sequence in the biosynthesis and localization of p185HER2. A truncation mutant lacking the cytoplasmic and transmembrane domains was glycosylated and efficiently secreted. However, a mutant lacking only the transmembrane-spanning sequence was incompletely glycosylated and failed to reach the cell surface. Unexpectedly, although this deletion mutant was retained in the endoplasmic reticulum membrane, it was still able to transform NIH 3T3 cells when expressed at high levels."
https://openalex.org/W2157579838,"Exposure of GH-3 cells to epidermal growth factor for 4 consecutive days induced the expression of both D-2(415) and D-2(444) dopamine-receptor isoforms. Epidermal growth factor also promoted a remarkable increase in the content of Gi3 protein, which is responsible for receptor-induced activation of potassium channels in GH-3 cells. D-2 receptors in this model apparently activate a specific transducing pathway, leading to opening of potassium channels and inhibition of prolactin release by cAMP-independent mechanisms. This is shown by: 1) the selective D-2 agonist quinpirole, while inactive on vasoactive intestinal peptide-induced prolactin release, strongly inhibited the hormone secretion induced by neurotensin; 2) quinpirole, up to 100 microM, did not inhibit cAMP production evoked by vasoactive intestinal peptide both in intact cells and in broken cell membrane preparations; and 3) quinpirole and other D-2 agonists strongly potentiated Rb+ efflux when measured in a nominally calcium-free reaction solution containing 100 mM potassium (voltage-dependent component), but did not modify Rb+ efflux if measured in a reaction solution containing 1 mM calcium and 5 mM potassium (calcium-activated, cAMP-dependent component)."

https://openalex.org/W1601534756,"Abstract L-Histidine and imidazole (the histidine side chain) significantly increase cAMP accumulation in intact LLC-PK1 cells. This effect is completely inhibited by isobutylmethylxanthine (IBMX). Histidine and imidazole stimulate cAMP phosphodiesterase activity in soluble and membrane fractions of LLC-PK1 cells suggesting that the IBMX-sensitive effect of these agents to stimulate cAMP formation is not due to inhibition of cAMP phosphodiesterase. Histidine and imidazole but not alanine (the histidine core structure) increase basal, GTP-, forskolin-, and AVP-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity in LLC-PK1 membranes. Two other amino acids with charged side chains (aspartic and glutamic acids) increase AVP-stimulated but neither basal- nor forskolin-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity. This suggests that multiple amino acids with charged side chains can regulate selected aspects of adenylate cyclase activity. To better define the mechanism of histidine regulation of adenylate cyclase, membranes were detergent-solubilized which prevents histidine and imidazole potentiation of forskolin-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity and suggests that an intact plasma membrane environment is required for potentiation. Neither pertussis toxin nor indomethacin pretreatment alter imidazole potentiation of adenylate cyclase. IBMX pretreatment of LLC-PK1 membranes also prevents imidazole to potentiate adenylate cyclase activity. Since IBMX inhibits adenylate cyclase coupled adenosine receptors, LLC-PK1 cells were incubated in vitro with 5'-N-ethylcarboxyamideadenosine (NECA) which produced a homologous pattern of desensitization of NECA to stimulate adenylate cyclase activity. Despite homologous desensitization, histidine and imidazole potentiation of adenylate cyclase was unaltered. These data suggest that histidine, acting via an imidazole ring, potentiates adenylate cyclase activity and thereby increases cAMP formation in cultured LLC-PK1 epithelial cells. This potentiation requires an intact plasma membrane environment, occurs independent of a pertussis toxin-sensitive substrate and of products of cyclooxygenase, and is inhibited by IBMX. This IBMX-sensitive pathway does not involve either inhibition of cAMP phosphodiesterase activity or a stimulatory adenosine receptor coupled to adenylate cyclase."
