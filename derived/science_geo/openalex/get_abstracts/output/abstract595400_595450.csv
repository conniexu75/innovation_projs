https://openalex.org/W2756471683,"Major advances in crop yields are needed in the coming decades. However, plant breeding is currently limited by incremental improvements in quantitative traits that often rely on laborious selection of rare naturally occurring mutations in gene-regulatory regions. Here, we demonstrate that CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing of promoters generates diverse cis-regulatory alleles that provide beneficial quantitative variation for breeding. We devised a simple genetic scheme, which exploits trans-generational heritability of Cas9 activity in heterozygous loss-of-function mutant backgrounds, to rapidly evaluate the phenotypic impact of numerous promoter variants for genes regulating three major productivity traits in tomato: fruit size, inflorescence branching, and plant architecture. Our approach allows immediate selection and fixation of novel alleles in transgene-free plants and fine manipulation of yield components. Beyond a platform to enhance variation for diverse agricultural traits, our findings provide a foundation for dissecting complex relationships between gene-regulatory changes and control of quantitative traits."

Our data show that initial CD28 signals during T cell activation prime mitochondria with latent metabolic capacity that is essential for future T cell responses. CD28 is the receptor for B7 molecules (CD80 and CD86), which are expressed on activated antigen presenting cells, and provide essential signals for full T cell activation. Over the years, it has become clear that CD28 signals do not act solely to amplify T cell receptor (TCR) signaling, but control a wide range of processes, including the cell cycle, epigenetic modifications, metabolism, and post-translational modifications (Esensten et al., 2016Esensten J.H.

Nevertheless, a complete understanding of the biology of CD28 is lacking. Because CD28 and its family members are targets of current and developing immunotherapies, understanding how these accessory receptors regulate T cell function is of broad interest and clinical importance (Esensten et al., 2016Esensten J.H.

A prevailing model in immunology is that CD28 promotes the glycolytic flux needed for full effector T (TE) cell activation, differentiation, and proliferation (Frauwirth et al., 2002Frauwirth K.A.

However, in vivo, T cells do not always require this initial CD28 costimulation to mount primary responses or to form long-lasting antigen-specific T cells but need it specifically to develop into protective memory (TM) cells, which “remember” past infections and respond robustly to secondary antigen challenge (Borowski et al., 2007Borowski A.B.

How initial CD28 signals contribute to the generation of protective TM cells remains unclear. We have shown that long-lived TM cells utilize fatty acid oxidation (FAO) and maintain fused mitochondria with tight cristae and spare respiratory capacity (SRC) (Buck et al., 2016Buck M.D. O’Sullivan D.

This metabolic phenotype facilitates their rapid recall function (van der Windt et al., 2013van der Windt G.J. O’Sullivan D. Everts B. Huang S.C. Buck M.D. Curtis J.D. Chang C.H. Smith A.M. Ai T. Faubert B. et al.CD8 memory T cells have a bioenergetic advantage that underlies their rapid recall ability.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2013; 110: 14336-14341Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). We therefore speculated that CD28 primes mitochondria during the initial phase of T cell activation with the metabolic capacity important for future recall of TM cells. We activated CD8+ naive T (TN) cells with αCD3 in the presence (+) or absence (−) of αCD28 (Figure 1A) and 8 hr later exposed them to oligomycin, an ATP synthase inhibitor, and carbonyl cyanide-4-(trifluoromethoxy)phenylhydrazone (FCCP), a protonophore that dissipates the mitochondrial H+ gradient and uncouples oxygen consumption from ATP production. FCCP reveals the maximal respiratory capacity as cells consume oxygen (measured as oxygen consumption rate [OCR]) in an attempt to re-establish the H+ gradient. Cells primed (+) αCD28 had an increased extracellular acidification rate (ECAR, indicates aerobic glycolysis) after oligomycin (indicating their glycolytic reserve [GR]) (Figure 1A), and increased uptake of 2-NBDG (Figure S1A), highlighting enhanced glycolysis in cells primed (+) αCD28 (Frauwirth et al., 2002Frauwirth K.A.

However, CD28 signals also endowed cells with significant SRC, measured as the difference between basal OCR (indicates oxidative phosphorylation [OXPHOS]) and maximal OCR after FCCP (Figures 1A and S1B). This early SRC was absent in T cells primed (−) αCD28, indicating that mitochondria in these cells were operating close to their bioenergetic limit. In keeping with similar basal OCR 8 hr after activation (Figure S1B), these cells had equal ATP levels in the basal state (Figure S1C).Figure S1TE and TM Cells Generated ±αCD28 Display Similar Surface Marker Expression and Viability and SRC Early after Activation Is Dependent on CD28 Signals, Independent of Strength of Signal by the TCR, Related to Figure 1Show full caption(A) Flow cytometric analysis of 2NBDG uptake during activation of cells activated with αCD3 ± αCD28.(B) Seahorse assay showing oxygen consumption after consecutive injection of activator beads, Oligomycin, FCCP (F), and Rotenone and Antimycin (R+A) (n = 3).(C) ATP assay run on 105 cells activated ± αCD28 at 8 hr after activation (n = 6).(D) Histograms depicting CD44 and CD62L expression post activation.

We assessed T cells differentiated toward the TM phenotype in interleukin (IL)-15 (IL-15 TM) (Figure 1B) and found that IL-15 TM cells primed (+) αCD28 had significant SRC, while the lack of SRC evident 8 hr after activation (Figures 1A and S1B) persisted in cells primed (−) αCD28 (Figure 1B), despite normal TM cell marker expression and survival (Figures S1D and S1E). Ex vivo TM cells from uninfected CD80/86−/− mice, which lack these ligands for CD28 and thus provide a costimulation-deficient environment, also displayed decreased SRC (Figures 1C and 1D). Furthermore, restimulated TM cells derived from TN cells primed (+) αCD28 increased OCR and exhibited marked SRC (≈200% of basal OCR) (Figure 1E) and GR (Figure S1F). However, IL-15 TM cells primed (−) αCD28 had diminished basal OCR that did not rise upon restimulation and had neither SRC (Figure 1E) nor GR (Figure S1F). IFN-γ production in IL-15 TM cells primed (−) αCD28 was also reduced (Figure 1F). Together, these data indicate that TM cells generated without costimulation are metabolically and functionally impaired. Initial CD28 signals imparted long-lasting mitochondrial SRC, and we questioned whether this could be detected in CD8+ TE cells (IL-2 TE), which do not require OXPHOS for energy if sufficient glucose and IL-2 are present for aerobic glycolysis (Chang et al., 2015Chang C.H.

IL-2 TE cells primed ± αCD28 had no differences in basal ECAR or OCR (before or after FCCP) when in 10 mM glucose (Figure 1G). When cells were forced to use mitochondrial-derived ATP by acute glucose-restriction (AGR), ECAR was diminished equivalently in cells generated ± αCD28 (Figure 1G). However, IL-2 TE primed (−) αCD28 cells placed under AGR failed to enhance OCR after oligomycin/FCCP (Figures 1G and S1G), revealing their lack of SRC (Figures 1H and S1H). Survival of the cells under AGR was unaffected at this time point (Figure S1I). SRC became evident in IL-2 TE cells primed (+) αCD28 under AGR (Figures 1G and 1H), indicating that CD28 signals during activation endow T cells with latent SRC. Increased TCR signal strength could not compensate for the absence of CD28 costimulation during activation, nor was TCR expression altered, but increased αCD28 promoted SRC further in a dose-dependent manner at 8 hr after activation (Figures S1J–S1L). We have previously shown that mitochondrial morphology influences T cell metabolism (Buck et al., 2016Buck M.D. O’Sullivan D. Klein Geltink R.I. Curtis J.D. Chang C.H. Sanin D.E. Qiu J. Kretz O.

We therefore analyzed mitochondrial shape in T cells at different times after activation ± αCD28. T cells primed (+) αCD28 displayed elongated mitochondria early after activation (Buck et al., 2016Buck M.D. O’Sullivan D. Klein Geltink R.I. Curtis J.D. Chang C.H. Sanin D.E. Qiu J. Kretz O.

Spherical mitochondria are associated with rapidly dividing glycolytic T cells (Buck et al., 2016Buck M.D. O’Sullivan D. Klein Geltink R.I. Curtis J.D. Chang C.H. Sanin D.E. Qiu J. Kretz O.

IL-15 TM cells primed (+) αCD28 contained tubulated mitochondria, while cells primed (−) αCD28 appeared less tubulated (Figure 2A). Unlike IL-2 TE cells primed (+) CD28, mitochondria in cells initially primed (−) αCD28 appeared less elongated in response to AGR (Figure 2B), correlating with their lack of SRC (Figure 1H). Therefore, CD28 signals during activation affect mitochondrial morphology in T cells.Figure S2Imaris Surface Rendering as a Quantifier for Mitochondrial Sphericity, Related to Figures 2 and 3Show full captionImaris software was used to quantify mitochondrial sphericity through surface rendering of the GFP signal localizing to the mitochondria.

It has been shown that tight cristae support efficient OXPHOS (Cogliati et al., 2013Cogliati S. Frezza C. Soriano M.E. Varanita T. Quintana-Cabrera R. Corrado M. Cipolat S. Costa V. Casarin A.

Braas D. van der Windt G.J. et al.Mitochondrial dynamics controls T cell fate through metabolic programming.Cell. 2016; 166: 63-76Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (751) Google Scholar). We found that T cells primed (−) αCD28 had significantly looser cristae 8 hr after activation, a phenotype propagated through IL-15 TM cell development (Figures 2C, 2D, and S2C) and also evident in TE cells under AGR (Figures 2C and 2D), consistent with their inability to invoke efficient OXPHOS when required (Figures 1G and 1H). These data suggested that CD28 costimulation restrained cristae loosening after TCR activation, and this early CD28 signal conferred the ability to maintain, or revert, to this morphological state throughout the life of the cells (Figure 2D). TN cells, and in vitro and in vivo generated TM cells, had tighter cristae than their TE cell counterparts (Figure 2E). Together, these data suggest cristae loosening is accelerated in T cells activated (−) CD28 and that they are never able to properly retighten their cristae after initial priming, a process that is important for TM cells. This early morphological change correlates with their persistent lack of SRC. FAO and SRC are evident in long-lived TM cells (Pearce et al., 2009Pearce E.L. Walsh M.C. Cejas P.J. Harms G.M. Shen H.

To determine whether CD28 influences FAO early after activation, we measured SRC in T cells primed ± αCD28 in the presence of (+) etomoxir (ETO), an irreversible inhibitor of Cpt1a, the rate-limiting enzyme for mitochondrial β-oxidation of long-chain fatty acids (Lopaschuk et al., 1988Lopaschuk G.D. Wall S.R. Olley P.M. Davies N.J. Etomoxir, a carnitine palmitoyltransferase I inhibitor, protects hearts from fatty acid-induced ischemic injury independent of changes in long chain acylcarnitine.Circ. Res. 1988; 63: 1036-1043Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). ETO abrogated CD28-induced SRC (Figure 3A), suggesting that CD28 promoted Cpt1a function early after activation to support SRC, a result we confirmed genetically by introducing Cpt1a siRNA into TN cells to knock down this protein prior to activation (Figures S3A and S3B). To assess whether CD28-mediated FAO was influenced by altered fatty acid uptake, we cultured T cells primed ± CD28 with bodipy-labeled palmitate and found no difference in acquisition 8 or 24 hr later (Figure S3C). IL-15 TM cells that were originally derived from a TE cell population primed (+) ETO, but subsequently cultured without ETO, showed impaired SRC, and injection of ETO onto control IL-15 TM cells reduced maximal OCR after FCCP to the level observed in cells activated (−) αCD28 or (+) ETO (Figure 3B). We also found that the decreased SRC in ex vivo TM cells isolated from CD80/86−/− mice was less sensitive to ETO when compared to wild-type (WT) TM cells, suggesting their reduced FAO (Figure S3D). Cells primed (+) αCD28 and (+) ETO did not robustly produce interferon (IFN)-γ upon restimulation (Figure 3C), similar to that observed in IL-15 TM cells initially primed (−) αCD28 (Figure 1F). We confirmed this result genetically by transducing TN cells prior to activation with Cpt1a-shRNA (sh) and then differentiating them toward the TM phenotype. Upon restimulation, the cells that expressed Cpt1a-sh during priming produced less IFN-γ later (Figures S3E and S3F), consistent with their inability to form robust TM cells.Figure S3CD28-Mediated SRC and Mitochondrial Remodeling during Metabolic Stress Is Dependent on Cpt1a Function, Related to Figures 3 and 4Show full caption(A) siRNA knock down efficiency in TN cells before activation (n = 3).(B) Activation of cells generated in (A). for 8 hr, followed by injection of Oligomycin and FCCP.

https://openalex.org/W2756247373,"Esr1+ cells in the VMHvl are well known to influence female sexual behaviors. Here the authors find a surprising new role of this population in female aggression. They further reveal that the female VMHvl contains two molecularly and anatomically distinct subdivisions: one for aggression and one for sex. As an essential means of resolving conflicts, aggression is expressed by both sexes but often at a higher level in males than in females. Recent studies suggest that cells in the ventrolateral part of the ventromedial hypothalamus (VMHvl) that express estrogen receptor-α (Esr1) and progesterone receptor are essential for male but not female mouse aggression. In contrast, here we show that VMHvlEsr1+ cells are indispensable for female aggression. This population was active when females attacked naturally. Inactivation of these cells reduced female aggression whereas their activation elicited attack. Additionally, we found that female VMHvl contains two anatomically distinguishable subdivisions that showed differential gene expression, projection and activation patterns after mating and fighting. These results support an essential role of the VMHvl in both male and female aggression and reveal the existence of two previously unappreciated subdivisions in the female VMHvl that are involved in distinct social behaviors."
https://openalex.org/W2755478460,"Objectives To assess efficacy and safety of rituximab (RTX) as induction therapy, maintenance of remission and treatment of relapses in a cohort of IgG4-related disease (IgG4-RD) patients. Methods Nationwide retrospective multicenter study of IgG4-RD patients treated with at least one course of RTX. Clinical, biological and radiological response, relapse rate and drug tolerance were analyzed. Kaplan-Meier curves were plotted and risk factors for relapse studied with a Cox regression model. Results Among 156 IgG4-RD patients included in the French database, 33 received rituximab. Clinical response was noted in 29/31 (93.5%) symptomatic patients. Glucocorticoids withdrawal was achieved in 17 (51.5%) patients. During a mean follow-up of 24.8 ±21 months, 13/31 (41.9%) responder patients relapsed after a mean delay of 19 ±11 months after RTX. Active disease, as defined by an IgG4-RD Responder Index >9 before RTX, was significantly associated with relapse (HR = 3.68, 95% CI: 1.1, 12.6) (P = 0.04), whereas maintenance therapy with systematic (i.e. before occurrence of a relapse) RTX retreatment was associated with longer relapse-free survival (41 versus 21 months; P = 0.02). Eight severe infections occurred in 4 patients during follow-up (severe infections rate of 12.1/100 patient-years) and hypogammaglobulinemia ≤5 g/l in 3 patients. Conclusion RTX is effective for both induction therapy and treatment of relapses in IgG4-RD, but relapses are frequent after B-cell reconstitution. Maintenance therapy with systematic RTX infusions is associated with longer relapse-free survival and might represent a novel treatment strategy. Yet, the high rate of infections and the temporary effect of RTX might be hindrances to such strategy."

https://openalex.org/W2755663835,"Harnessing information encoded in environmental DNA (eDNA) in marine waters has the potential to revolutionize marine biomonitoring. Whether using organism-specific quantitative PCR assays or metabarcoding in conjunction with amplicon sequencing, scientists have illustrated that realistic organism censuses can be inferred from eDNA. The next step is establishing ways to link information obtained from eDNA analyses to actual organism abundance. This is only possible by understanding the processes that control eDNA concentrations. The present study uses mesocosm experiments to study the persistence of eDNA in marine waters and explore the role of sunlight in modulating eDNA persistence. We seeded solute-permeable dialysis bags with water containing indigenous eDNA and suspended them in a large tank containing seawater. Bags were subjected to two treatments: half the bags were suspended near the water surface where they received high doses of sunlight, and half at depth where they received lower doses of sunlight. Bags were destructively sampled over the course of 87 hours. eDNA was extracted from water samples and used as template for a Scomber japonicus qPCR assay and a marine fish-specific 12S rRNA PCR assay. The latter was subsequently sequenced using a metabarcoding approach. S. japonicus eDNA, as measured by qPCR, exhibited first order decay with a rate constant ~0.01 hr -1 with no difference in decay rate constants between the two experimental treatments. eDNA metabarcoding identified 190 organizational taxonomic units (OTUs) assigned to varying taxonomic ranks. There was no difference in marine fish communities as measured by eDNA metabarcoding between the two experimental treatments, but there was an effect of time. Given the differences in UVA and UVB fluence received by the two experimental treatments, we conclude that sunlight is not the main driver of fish eDNA decay in the experiments. However, there are clearly temporal effects that need to be considered when interpreting information obtained using eDNA approaches."
https://openalex.org/W2754076530,"Neural progenitor cells (NeuPCs) possess a unique nuclear architecture that changes during differentiation. Nucleoporins are linked with cell-type-specific gene regulation, coupling physical changes in nuclear structure to transcriptional output; but, whether and how they coordinate with key fate-determining transcription factors is unclear. Here we show that the nucleoporin Nup153 interacts with Sox2 in adult NeuPCs, where it is indispensable for their maintenance and controls neuronal differentiation. Genome-wide analyses show that Nup153 and Sox2 bind and co-regulate hundreds of genes. Binding of Nup153 to gene promoters or transcriptional end sites correlates with increased or decreased gene expression, respectively, and inhibiting Nup153 expression alters open chromatin configurations at its target genes, disrupts genomic localization of Sox2, and promotes differentiation in vitro and a gliogenic fate switch in vivo. Together, these findings reveal that nuclear structural proteins may exert bimodal transcriptional effects to control cell fate."

The step I and II reactions proceed in the B∗ and C∗ complexes, resulting in the C and P complexes, respectively. The B-to-Bact, Bact-to-B∗, and C-to-C∗ transitions are driven by the RNA-dependent ATPases/helicases Brr2, Prp2, and Prp16, respectively (Cordin et al., 2012Cordin O. Hahn D. Beggs J.D.

Using a similar 3D classification strategy (Yan et al., 2016Yan C. Wan R. Bai R. Huang G. Shi Y. Structure of a yeast activated spliceosome at 3.5 Å resolution.Science. 2016; 353: 904-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar), we picked 163,051 particles from this dataset that may represent the ILS complex. These particles only allowed structure determination of the ILS complex at a moderate resolution. To improve the data quality, we prepared a new batch of the spliceosomal complex using affinity-tagged Yju2 (Figure S1). A total of 4,375 micrographs were collected on the new cryo-EM sample, generating 139,470 particles for the ILS complex (Figure S2A). These particles were combined with the earlier ILS particles. Following 3D classifications, a subset of 150,363 particles yielded a reconstruction of the ILS complex at 3.5 Å. An additional step of 3D classification further improved the EM density map (Figure S2A).Figure S2Cryo-EM Analysis of the Spliceosomal ILS Complex from S. cerevisiae, Related to Figure 1Show full caption(A) A flow chart for the structural analysis of the cryo-EM data of the spliceosomal ILS complex from S. cerevisiae.

https://openalex.org/W2755710985,"Many cancer treatments, such as those for managing recalcitrant tumors like pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, cause off-target toxicities in normal, healthy tissue, highlighting the need for more tumor-selective chemotherapies. β-Lapachone is bioactivated by NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1). This enzyme exhibits elevated expression in most solid cancers and therefore is a potential cancer-specific target. β-Lapachone's therapeutic efficacy partially stems from the drug's induction of a futile NQO1-mediated redox cycle that causes high levels of superoxide and then peroxide formation, which damages DNA and causes hyperactivation of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase, resulting in extensive NAD+/ATP depletion. However, the effects of this drug on energy metabolism due to NAD+ depletion were never described. The futile redox cycle rapidly consumes O2, rendering standard assays of Krebs cycle turnover unusable. In this study, a multimodal analysis, including metabolic imaging using hyperpolarized pyruvate, points to reduced oxidative flux due to NAD+ depletion after β-lapachone treatment of NQO1+ human pancreatic cancer cells. NAD+-sensitive pathways, such as glycolysis, flux through lactate dehydrogenase, and the citric acid cycle (as inferred by flux through pyruvate dehydrogenase), were down-regulated by β-lapachone treatment. Changes in flux through these pathways should generate biomarkers useful for in vivo dose responses of β-lapachone treatment in humans, avoiding toxic side effects. Targeting the enzymes in these pathways for therapeutic treatment may have the potential to synergize with β-lapachone treatment, creating unique NQO1-selective combinatorial therapies for specific cancers. These findings warrant future studies of intermediary metabolism in patients treated with β-lapachone."
https://openalex.org/W2756320564,"Absorption of neutral amino acids across the luminal membrane of intestinal enterocytes is mediated by the broad neutral amino acid transporter B0AT1 (SLC6A19). Its intestinal expression depends on co-expression of the membrane-anchored peptidase angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and is additionally enhanced by aminopeptidase N (CD13). We investigated in this study the expression of B0AT1 and its auxiliary peptidases as well as its transport function along the rat small intestine. Additionally, we tested its possible short- and long-term regulation by dietary proteins and amino acids. We showed by immunofluorescence that B0AT1, ACE2 and CD13 co-localize on the luminal membrane of small intestinal villi and by Western blotting that their protein expression increases in distal direction. Furthermore, we observed an elevated transport activity of the neutral amino acid L-isoleucine during the nocturnal active phase compared to the inactive one. Gastric emptying was delayed by intragastric application of an amino acid cocktail but we observed no acute dietary regulation of B0AT1 protein expression and L-isoleucine transport. Investigation of the chronic dietary regulation of B0AT1, ACE2 and CD13 by different diets revealed an increased B0AT1 protein expression under amino acid-supplemented diet in the proximal section but not in the distal one and for ACE2 protein expression a reverse localization of the effect. Dietary regulation for CD13 protein expression was not as distinct as for the two other proteins. Ring uptake experiments showed a tendency for increased L-isoleucine uptake under amino acid-supplemented diet and in vivo L-isoleucine absorption was more efficient under high protein and amino acid-supplemented diet. Additionally, plasma levels of branched-chain amino acids were elevated under high protein and amino acid diet. Taken together, our experiments did not reveal an acute amino acid-induced regulation of B0AT1 but revealed a chronic dietary adaptation mainly restricted to the proximal segment of the small intestine."

In vitro kinase assays and genetic and pharmacological manipulations of GSK-3 have identified more than 100 putative GSK-3 substrates in diverse cell types. Many more have been predicted on the basis of a recurrent GSK-3 consensus motif ((pS/pT)XX(S/T)), but this prediction has not been tested by analyzing the GSK-3 phosphoproteome. Using stable isotope labeling of amino acids in culture (SILAC) and MS techniques to analyze the repertoire of GSK-3–dependent phosphorylation in mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs), we found that ∼2.4% of (pS/pT)XX(S/T) sites are phosphorylated in a GSK-3–dependent manner. A comparison of WT and Gsk3a;Gsk3b knock-out (Gsk3 DKO) ESCs revealed prominent GSK-3–dependent phosphorylation of multiple splicing factors and regulators of RNA biosynthesis as well as proteins that regulate transcription, translation, and cell division.

https://openalex.org/W2754310988,"Tumor Necrosis Factor alpha (TNF-α) has been shown to be released by tumor cells in response to docetaxel, and lipopolysaccharides (LPS), the latter through activation of toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4). However, it is unclear whether the former involves TLR4 receptor activation through direct binding of the drug to TLR4 at the cell surface. The current study was intended to better understand drug-induced TNF-α production in tumor cells, whether from short-term drug exposure or in cells selected for drug resistance. ELISAs were employed to measure cytokine release from breast and ovarian tumor cells in response to several structurally distinct chemotherapy agents and/or TLR4 agonists or antagonists. Drug uptake and drug sensitivity studies were also performed. We observed that several drugs induced TNF-αrelease from multiple tumor cell lines. Docetaxel-induced cytokine production was distinct from that of LPS in both MyD88-positive (MCF-7) and MyD88-deficient (A2780) cells. The acquisition of docetaxel resistance was accompanied by increased constitutive production of TNF-αand CXCL1, which waned at higher levels of resistance. In docetaxel-resistant MCF-7 and A2780 cell lines, the production of TNF-α could not be significantly augmented by docetaxel without the inhibition of P-gp, a transporter protein that promotes drug efflux from tumor cells. Pretreatment of tumor cells with LPS sensitized MyD88-positive cells (but not MyD88-deficient) to docetaxel cytotoxicity in both drug-naive and drug-resistant cells. Our findings suggest that taxane-induced inflammatory cytokine production from tumor cells depends on the duration of exposure, requires cellular drug-accumulation, and is distinct from the LPS response seen in breast tumor cells. Also, stimulation of the LPS-induced pathway may be an attractive target for treatment of drug-resistant disease."

This alteration is relatively non-specific, resulting in the necessity of confirmation and differential diagnosis in subsequent tests. Thus, we aimed to develop a multiplex approach for concurrent determination of 3-hydroxypropionic acid, methylmalonic acid and methylcitric acid from the same dried blood spot (DBS) as in primary screening (second-tier test). We also set out to validate the method using newborn and follow-up samples of patients with confirmed PA or MMACBL. Methods The assay was developed using liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry and clinically validated with retrospective analysis of DBS samples from PA or MMACBL patients. Results Reliable determination of all three analytes in DBSs was achieved following simple and fast (<20 min) sample preparation without laborious derivatization or any additional pipetting steps. The method clearly distinguished the pathological and normal samples and differentiated between PA and MMACBL in all stored newborn specimens. Methylcitric acid was elevated in all PA samples; 3-hydroxypropionic acid was also high in most cases. Methylmalonic acid was increased in all MMACBL specimens; mostly together with methylcitric acid. Conclusions A liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry assay allowing simultaneous determination of the biomarkers 3-hydroxypropionic acid, methylmalonic acid and methylcitric acid in DBSs has been developed. The assay can use the same specimen as in primary screening (second-tier test) which may reduce the need for repeated blood sampling. The presented preliminary findings suggest that this method can reliably differentiate patients with PA and MMACBL in newborn screening. The validated assay is being evaluated prospectively in a pilot project for extension of the German newborn screening panel (‟Newborn screening 2020”; Newborn Screening Center, University Hospital Heidelberg)."
https://openalex.org/W2755837499,"Newly synthesized proteins engage molecular chaperones that assist folding. Their progress is monitored by quality control systems that target folding errors for degradation. Paradoxically, chaperones that promote folding also direct unfolded polypeptides for degradation. Hence, a mechanism was previously hypothesized that prevents the degradation of actively folding polypeptides. In this study, we show that a conserved endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane protein complex, consisting of Slp1 and Emp65 proteins, performs this function in the ER lumen. The complex binds unfolded proteins and protects them from degradation during folding. In its absence, approximately 20%–30% of newly synthesized proteins that could otherwise fold are degraded. Although the Slp1-Emp65 complex hosts a broad range of clients, it is specific for soluble proteins. Taken together, these studies demonstrate the vulnerability of newly translated, actively folding polypeptides and the discovery of a new proteostasis functional class we term “guardian” that protects them from degradation."

Here, we sought to identify factors that induce CYGB expression in HSCs and to clarify the molecular mechanism involved. We used the human HSC cell line HHSteC and primary human HSCs isolated from intact human liver tissues. In HHSteC cells, treatment with a culture supplement solution that included fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2) increased CYGB expression with concomitant and time-dependent α-smooth muscle actin (αSMA) down-regulation. We found that FGF2 is a key factor in inducing the alteration in both CYGB and αSMA expression in HHSteCs and primary HSCs and that FGF2 triggered the rapid phosphorylation of both c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and c-JUN. Both the JNK inhibitor PS600125 and transfection of c-JUN–targeting siRNA abrogated FGF2-mediated CYGB induction, and conversely, c-JUN overexpression induced CYGB and reduced αSMA expression. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analyses revealed that upon FGF2 stimulation, phospho-c-JUN bound to its consensus motif (5′-TGA(C/G)TCA), located −218 to −222 bases from the transcription initiation site in the CYGB promoter. Of note, in bile duct–ligated mice, FGF2 administration ameliorated liver fibrosis and significantly reduced HSC activation.

https://openalex.org/W2754899358,"Myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) and type 2 (DM2) are autosomal dominant multisystemic disorders caused by expansion of microsatellite repeats. In both forms, the mutant transcripts accumulate in nuclear foci altering the function of alternative splicing regulators which are necessary for the physiological mRNA processing. Missplicing of insulin receptor (IR) gene (INSR) has been associated with insulin resistance, however, it cannot be excluded that post-receptor signalling abnormalities could also contribute to this feature in DM. We have analysed the insulin pathway in skeletal muscle biopsies and in myotube cultures from DM patients to assess whether downstream metabolism might be dysregulated and to better characterize the mechanism inducing insulin resistance. DM skeletal muscle exhibits alterations of basal phosphorylation levels of Akt/PKB, p70S6K, GSK3β and ERK1/2, suggesting that these changes might be accompanied by a lack of further insulin stimulation. Alterations of insulin pathway have been confirmed on control and DM myotubes expressing fetal INSR isoform (INSR-A). The results indicate that insulin action appears to be lower in DM than in control myotubes in terms of protein activation and glucose uptake. Our data indicate that post-receptor signalling abnormalities might contribute to DM insulin resistance regardless the alteration of INSR splicing."
https://openalex.org/W2755634019,"Background/Objectives The relationship between body mass index (BMI) and mortality remains controversial. Furthermore, the association between BMI and cardiovascular events (CVE) is not conclusive and may differ by ethnicity. We aimed to estimate the associations between the BMI and mortality or cardiovascular disease in a general Korean population. Subjects/Methods This study was based on a sample cohort database released by the Korean National Health Insurance Service. We analyzed a total of 415,796 adults older than 30 years of age who had undergone a national health examination at least once from 2002 to 2012. Hazard ratios for death and cardiovascular events were calculated using Cox proportional hazards models. Results For both men and women, BMI and overall mortality showed a U-shaped association, with the lowest mortality rate among those with a BMI of 25–27.4 kg/m2. Compared with them, subjects with a BMI ≥ 30kg/m2, men with a BMI < 25 kg/m2, and women with a BMI < 22.5 kg/m2 showed significantly higher overall mortality. Additionally, men with a BMI < 22.5 kg/m2 and women with a BMI < 20 kg/m2 displayed an increased risk of cardiovascular mortality. Unlike the mortality trend, the CVD events trend showed a linearly positive association. The risk of a CVE was the lowest in men with a BMI ranging from 20 to 22.4 kg/m2 and in women with a BMI < 20 kg/m2. Conclusions The BMI showed a U-shaped association with overall mortality, where slightly obese subjects showed the lowest rate of mortality. The CVE exhibited a linear association with the BMI, where the lowest risk was observed for normal weight subjects in a general Korean population."
https://openalex.org/W2756042827,"Expansion of adipose tissue in response to a positive energy balance underlies obesity and occurs through both hypertrophy of existing cells and increased differentiation of adipocyte precursors (hyperplasia). To better understand the nutrient signals that promote adipocyte differentiation, we investigated the role of glucose availability in regulating adipocyte differentiation and maturation. 3T3-L1 preadipocytes were grown and differentiated in medium containing a standard differentiation hormone mixture and either 4 or 25 mm glucose. Adipocyte maturation at day 9 post-differentiation was determined by key adipocyte markers, including glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) and adiponectin expression and Oil Red O staining of neutral lipids. We found that adipocyte differentiation and maturation required a pulse of 25 mm glucose only during the first 3 days of differentiation. Importantly, fatty acids were unable to substitute for the 25 mm glucose pulse during this period. The 25 mm glucose pulse increased adiponectin and GLUT4 expression and accumulation of neutral lipids via distinct mechanisms. Adiponectin expression and other early markers of differentiation required an increase in the intracellular pool of total NAD/P. In contrast, GLUT4 protein expression was only partially restored by increased NAD/P levels. Furthermore, GLUT4 mRNA expression was mediated by glucose-dependent activation of GLUT4 gene transcription through the cis-acting GLUT4–liver X receptor element (LXRE) promoter element. In summary, this study supports the conclusion that high glucose promotes adipocyte differentiation via distinct metabolic pathways and independently of fatty acids. This may partly explain the mechanism underlying adipocyte hyperplasia that occurs much later than adipocyte hypertrophy in the development of obesity."

Angiogenesis is dysregulated in various pathologies, including age-related macular degeneration, arthritis, and cancer. Inhibiting pathological angiogenesis therefore represents a promising therapeutic strategy for treating these disorders, highlighting the need to study angiogenesis in more detail. To this end, identifying the genes essential for blood vessel formation and elucidating their function are crucial for a complete understanding of angiogenesis. Here, focusing on potential candidate genes for angiogenesis, we performed a morpholino-based genetic screen in zebrafish and identified Cavin-2, a membrane-bound phosphatidylserine-binding protein and critical organizer of caveolae (small microdomains in the plasma membrane), as a regulator of angiogenesis. Using endothelial cells, we show that Cavin-2 is required for in vitro angiogenesis and also for endothelial cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. We noted a high level of Cavin-2 expression in the neovascular tufts in the mouse model of oxygen-induced retinopathy, suggesting a role for Cavin-2 in pathogenic angiogenesis. Interestingly, we also found that Cavin-2 regulates the production of nitric oxide (NO) in endothelial cells by controlling the stability and activity of the endothelial nitric-oxide synthase (eNOS) and that Cavin-2 knockdown cells produce much less NO than WT cells. Also, mass spectrometry, flow cytometry, and electron microscopy analyses indicated that Cavin-2 is secreted in endothelial microparticles (EMPs) and is required for EMP biogenesis.

Generation of blood vessels (or angiogenesis) plays a fundamental role in embryogenesis, organogenesis, and wound healing (1Adams R.H. Alitalo K. Molecular regulation of angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 8: 464-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (1459) Google Scholar). Angiogenesis occurs through sequential events that are highly regulated by growth factors, cytokines, and mechanical forces (2Carmeliet P. Jain R.K. Molecular mechanisms and clinical applications of angiogenesis.Nature. 2011; 473: 298-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (3725) Google Scholar). Abnormal or excessive formation of blood vessels due to inappropriate angiogenic signaling contributes to diseases such as age-related macular degeneration, diabetic retinopathy, atherosclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, and cancer (3Fong D.S.

These disease conditions are underscored by dysregulated angiogenic signals and therefore, there is a need to study angiogenesis in immense detail for development of better or alternative therapeutic approaches (6Kushner E.J.

Identification of genes essential for blood vessel formation and elucidating their mechanistic roles are crucial for the understanding of angiogenesis and also for the discovery of novel therapeutic targets. In this study, we performed a morpholino-based gene knockdown screen to identify novel players in angiogenesis. We utilized zebrafish Tg(fli1a:EGFP)y1 for our initial screen as it allows direct visualization of putative vascular phenotypes through the expression of enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) 3The abbreviations used are: EGFPenhanced green fluorescent proteinSDPRserum deprivation-response proteineNOSendothelial nitric-oxide synthaseHUVEChuman umbilical vein endothelial cellEMPendothelial microparticlesHPAHuman Protein Atlashpfh post-fertilizationHAEChuman aortic endothelial cellHPMEChuman pulmonary microvascular endothelial cellHRMVEChuman retinal microvascular endothelial cellsOIRoxygen-induced retinopathyqRT-PCRquantitative real time PCRMTT3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromideEGM-2endothelial cell growth mediumDAF-24,5-diaminofluorescein diacetatel-NAMENω-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester hydrochlorideWCLwhole cell lysateAMCAaminomethylcoumarin acetatePER-phycoerythrinVEvascular endothelialPFAparaformaldehyde. under the control of the fli1a promoter (7Lawson N.D.

From the screen, we identify that Cavin-2 (SDPR; serum deprivation-response protein) is required for angiogenesis in zebrafish. Cavin-2 is a membrane-bound phosphatidylserine-binding protein and a member of the Cavin family of proteins that regulate caveolae structure and function (8Burgener R. Wolf M. Ganz T. Baggiolini M.

Caveolae are Ω-shaped cell surface invaginations that make up to 50% of plasma membrane and serves as a major repertoire for multiple signaling molecules including endothelial nitric-oxide synthase (eNOS) in the endothelial cells (10García-Cardeña G.

Nitric oxide (NO) produced by eNOS is crucial for systemic blood pressure, vascular remodeling, and angiogenesis (13Rudic R.D. Shesely E.G. Maeda N. Smithies O. Segal S.S. Sessa W.C.

Elevated vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) levels are responsible for various pathological angiogenic conditions and VEGF-induced angiogenesis can be blocked by inhibition of eNOS-mediated NO production (15Papapetropoulos A.

The regulation of eNOS by caveolin-1 has been extensively studied but the role of other caveolae proteins on the regulation of eNOS has not been reported. Here we demonstrate that Cavin-2 is required for cell proliferation, migration, and invasion in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). We show that Cavin-2 is required for in vitro angiogenesis in multiple endothelial cells. We find that Cavin-2 controls the production of NO by maintaining the stability and activity of eNOS in HUVECs. In addition, we find that Cavin-2 is highly secreted in endothelial microparticles (EMP) but not in exosomes and is required for EMP generation. To identify the novel genes involved in angiogenesis, we screened a list of candidate genes from the Human Protein Atlas (HPA) and BioGPS. The “tissue atlas” in HPA has the protein expression data derived from antibody-based profiling of human proteome using immunohistochemistry (22Uhlen M. Fagerberg L. Hallstrom B.M. Lindskog C. Oksvold P. Mardinoglu A. Sivertsson Å. Kampf C. Sjöstedt E. Asplund A. Olsson I. Edlund K. Lundberg E. Navani S. Szigyarto C.A. et al.Proteomics: tissue-based map of the human proteome.Science. 2015; 347: 1260419Crossref PubMed Scopus (7250) Google Scholar). BioGPS is a unified source for distributed gene-annotation resources such as gene expression (23Wu C. Orozco C. Boyer J. Leglise M. Goodale J. Batalov S. Hodge C.L. Haase J. Janes J. Huss 3rd, J.W. Su A.I. BioGPS: an extensible and customizable portal for querying and organizing gene annotation resources.Genome Biol. 2009; 10: R130Crossref PubMed Scopus (1094) Google Scholar). A test scale of candidate genes were selected based on their combined protein and mRNA expression profiles restricted to blood vessels in HPA and BioGPS, respectively (Table 1). But the candidate genes weighting were based mainly on HPA as it offered a direct visualization of proteins localized in blood vessels in a variety of normal human tissues using immunohistochemistry. We utilized transgenic zebrafish Tg(fli1a:EGFP)y1 to examine their involvement in angiogenesis in vivo. The protein levels in zebrafish embryos can readily be reduced using morpholinos (24Summerton J. Weller D. Morpholino antisense oligomers: design, preparation, and properties.Antisense Nucleic Acid Drug. Dev. 1997; 7: 187-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (879) Google Scholar). We designed two independent morpholinos for each gene (one that blocks mRNA splicing and the other blocks protein translation) and tested them in zebrafish. When injected with the morpholinos against the candidate genes potentially regulating angiogenesis at the single-cell stage of zebrafish embryos, we anticipated pronounced defects in sprouting blood vessels at 24 h post-fertilization (hpf). Accordingly, our approach included a preliminarily screen of the candidate genes in zebrafish, validation of the results in human endothelial cell, and functional analysis of genes involved in angiogenesis (Fig. 1A).Table 1List of candidate genes used in zebrafish screenNo.Gene nameFull name1CLEC14AC-type lectin domain family 14, member A2RYKRelated to receptor tyrosine kinase3TMEM43Transmembrane protein 434TMEM59Transmembrane protein 595IL7RInterleukin-7 receptor6SDPRSerum deprivation response; Cavin-27TINAGL1Lipocalin 7 Open table in a new tab Morpholinos against TMEM43, TMEM59, and IL7R did not show obvious differences in intersomitic blood vessels with reference to control morpholinos (Fig. 1B). But the morpholinos against CLEC14A, RYK, and TINAGL1 showed poorly connected intersomitic blood vessels. Earlier reports indicate that CLEC14A, RYK, and TINAGL1 are suggested to be involved in angiogenesis (25Mura M. Swain R.K. Zhuang X. Vorschmitt H. Reynolds G. Durant S. Beesley J.F. Herbert J.M. Sheldon H. Andre M. Sanderson S. Glen K. Luu N.T. McGettrick H.M.

The CLEC14A gene in zebrafish is encoded by a single exon, hence we designed only protein translations blocking morpholino to target it. The complete list of morpholinos used in the zebrafish screen is available in Table 2. The evolutionally conserved role of CLEC14A, RYK, and TINAGL1 in zebrafish suggests our approach is a reliable one.Table 2List of morpholino sequences of candidate genes used in zebrafish screenNo.Gene name (human)Oligo nameMorpholino sequences (5′-3′)1CLEC14Aclec14a-mo1ACCATCCAGAAATCCATGTCTGCTC2RYKryk-mo1GGCGACATGCTACTGGGTTTTGACG3RYKryk-mo2ATCGACCAGCGCCACGGAACCTCAT4TMEM43tmem43-mo1TCCACCCATTGGTACATCTCCACTT5TMEM43tmem43-mo2ACACACACACACTGACCTCGTTGGT6TMEM59tmem59-mo1TCCCGTAGGACTTTATTGCACTCAT7TMEM59tmem59-mo2ACAAGCCGACAGTCTCGCACTCACC8IL7Ril7r-mo1AGATAATCCACAAAAGTCCCGCCAT9IL7Ril7r-mo2ATGTGTTAAGAAGTACCAGAGTGTT10SDPRsdpra-mo1CGTGAGAGGAGTCTTCACCCATCCT11SDPRsdpra-mo2ACTCTAAAGCATCTTCTCACCTGGA12TINAGL1tinagl1-mo1GCACCCAGAGCCTCAACATCGCTTA13TINAGL1tinagl1-mo2TTAAACTCACTGGGAGGGTAGGGAG14Control-moCCTCTTACCTCAGTTACAATTTATA Open table in a new tab Additionally, our initial screen identified that the Cavin-2 orthologue, Sdpra, is required for angiogenesis in zebrafish (Figs. 1B and 2A). When compared with control morpholinos, injection of two independent morpholinos against Cavin-2 (both sdpra-mo1 and sdpra-mo2) led to severe reduction of intersomitic blood vessels that failed to connect dorsally to form the dorsal longitudinal anastomotic vessel (Fig. 2A, zoomed inlet). The images of cavin-2 morphants in Fig. 2A were duplicated from the morpholino screen from Fig. 1B to show the detailed view on phenotypic and angiogenic differences between the cavin-2 morphants and control. The morpholino results indicate that Cavin-2 contributes to angiogenesis and vascular patterning, a previously unreported role. We focused further on Cavin-2 to elucidate its functional role in angiogenesis. We initially checked the protein expression levels of Cavin-2 in a panel of endothelial cells; we found that human aortic endothelial cells (HAEC), HUVEC, human pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells (HPMEC), and human retinal microvascular endothelial cells (HRMVEC) have high level of expression of Cavin-2 (Fig. 2B and supplemental Fig. S1). One of the well known models to study aberrant angiogenesis in retina is the oxygen-induced retinopathy (OIR) in mice. The retinal vasculature in mice usually starts to develop around birth and is complete around 3 weeks after birth (28Scott A. Fruttiger M. Oxygen-induced retinopathy: a model for vascular pathology in the retina.Eye. 2010; 24: 416-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 29Fruttiger M. Development of the retinal vasculature.Angiogenesis. 2007; 10: 77-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). Exploiting this phenomenon, in OIR, 7-day-old pups are exposed to hyperoxia (70%) for 5 days (P7–P12), this exposure to high-oxygen damages the developing blood vessels in mice. After 5 days, the pups are returned to normal room air. At this point, the retina becomes hypoxic and generates a vascular overhaul response resulting in the formation of neovascular growth (tufts) that resemble the pathologic neovascularizations observed in human retinopathy of prematurity or proliferative diabetic retinopathy (28Scott A. Fruttiger M. Oxygen-induced retinopathy: a model for vascular pathology in the retina.Eye. 2010; 24: 416-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The OIR model works efficiently as the retinal flat-mount analysis of the vasculature of the above mentioned procedure shows the formation of neovascular tufts (top arrow) and avascular area (bottom arrow) at P17 (supplemental Fig. S2A). Using OIR of the normal pups, we found strong staining of cavin-2 in angiogenic neovascular tufts (white arrow) and moderate staining of cavin-2 in normal blood vessels (yellow arrow) as determined based on co-staining with CD31 (Fig. 2C). We isolated and tested for cavin-2 mRNA expression on retina using quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) from birth until mature retinal vasculature, from P2 to P21, and adult mice. Interestingly, we find a significant increase in cavin-2 mRNA expression at P21 when compared with P2 that correlated with increased vessel density in developing mouse retina (Fig. 2D). Similarly, immunofluorescence staining of Cavin-2 on retinal vasculature at P7 mouse pups clearly shows a low-homogenous expression and moderate levels in mature retinal vasculature at P21 (Fig. 2E). The high staining of Cavin-2 in neovascular tufts and gradual increase in mRNA expression during postnatal development clearly indicate that Cavin-2 is likely to be involved in angiogenesis. To rule out the possibility of nonspecific antibody staining, we tested only anti-rabbit secondary antibody to stain neovascular tufts and found that the secondary antibody did not stain any tufts (supplemental Fig. S2B), indicating the Cavin-2 antibody staining is specific. High cavin-2 expression in angiogenic neovascular tufts indicates that Cavin-2 could be involved in pathogenic angiogenesis such as age-related macular degeneration and diabetic retinopathy. To find out the role of Cavin-2 in endothelial cells, we used a “loss-of-function” approach using siRNAs. Using a pool of specific siRNAs against Cavin-2, we could ablate up to 75% of Cavin-2 expression in HUVECs (Fig. 3A). To form blood vessels, endothelial cells are required to migrate from the contact inhibited state, proliferate, and invade the extracellular matrix (30Baguley B.K. Kerr D Anticancer Drug Development. Academic Press, New York2001Google Scholar). We checked whether the Cavin-2-depleted endothelial cells were able to proliferate, migrate, and invade the Matrigel. For cell proliferation assays, we used non-targeting siRNA (siControl) and Cavin-2 knockdown (siCavin-2) HUVECs. An equal number of HUVECs from each condition were plated in 96 wells and followed the cell proliferation using MTT assay for 4 days. Notably, compared with siControl cells, the cell proliferation was significantly decreased from the second day until the fourth day in siCavin-2 cells (p = 0.025, p = 0.017, and p = 0.001 for day 2, day 3, and day 4, respectively) (Fig. 3B). Assuming the importance of endothelial cell migration in VEGF-mediated angiogenesis (31Lamalice L. Le Boeuf F. Huot J. Endothelial cell migration during angiogenesis.Circ. Res. 2007; 100: 782-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (1036) Google Scholar), we performed two independent cell-migration assays. In the wound healing assay, siControl and siCavin-2 HUVECs were grown to confluence, scratched to create a migratory space, and the cells were allowed to migrate. Interestingly, Cavin-2-silenced HUVECs migrated significantly slower compared with siControl at 16 h (p = 0.007) (Fig. 3, C and D). Also, in the transwell migration assay, Cavin-2-silenced HUVECs had a significantly reduced migratory potential than control HUVECs (p = 0.0129) (Fig. 3, E and F). In the Matrigel invasion assay, Cavin-2 knocked down HUVECs had a significantly lesser ability to invade the basement membrane matrix than the control HUVECs (p = 0.0043) (Fig. 3, G and H). To test whether Cavin-2 is essential for angiogenesis in endothelial cells, we performed a in vitro tube-formation assay. Formation of capillary-like tubes by endothelial cells on a basement membrane matrix (Matrigel) in in vitro is a powerful method to screen for various factors that promote or inhibit angiogenesis (32Kubota Y. Kleinman H.K. Martin G.R. Lawley T.J. Role of laminin and basement membrane in the morphological differentiation of human endothelial cells into capillary-like structures.J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 1589-1598Crossref PubMed Scopus (975) Google Scholar). After Cavin-2 knockdown, in vitro tube formation in Matrigel were performed in four different types of endothelial cells. In all four endothelial cell types: HAEC (Fig. 4A), HUVEC (Fig. 4C), HPMEC (Fig. 4E), and HRMVEC (Fig. 4G), Cavin-2 ablation severely affected the tube-forming ability of endothelial cells. We then quantified the number of branches and the total network length from the in vitro angiogenesis assays using ImageJ. The number of branches and the endothelial tubular network were significantly reduced after silencing Cavin-2 in HAEC (Fig. 4B, p = 0.022 and p = 0.009, respectively), HUVEC (Fig. 4D, p = 0.031 and p = 0.025, respectively), HPMEC (Fig. 4F, p = 0.008 and p = 0.012, respectively), and HRMVEC (Fig. 4H, p = 0.022 and p = 0.006, respectively) when compared with the controls. To validate the effect of knockdown of cavin-2 were not due to the off-target effect of siRNAs, we deconvoluted the siRNA pool. We used individual siRNAs from the pool and tested their knockdown efficiencies in HUVECs. We find that two individual siRNAs (numbers 6 and 7) have strong knockdown efficiency than other Cavin-2 siRNAs (Fig. 5A). In HUVECs, we performed the in vitro angiogenesis assay using these two efficient siRNAs (Fig. 5B). Reassuringly, the two efficient siRNAs against Cavin-2 produced significantly lesser branches (p = 0.029 and 0.005 for numbers 6 and 7, respectively) and endothelial tubular network (p = 0.024 and 0.021 for numbers 6 and 7, respectively) in HUVECs (Fig. 5C). Two independent siRNAs specific to cavin-2 resulting in defective in vitro angiogenesis clearly show that the defective angiogenesis is indeed specific to the loss of cavin-2. Taken together, the data from zebrafish and the results from in vitro experiments on knockdown of Cavin-2 in a variety of endothelial cells strongly suggest that Cavin-2 is required for proper angiogenesis. Caveolae-related proteins are very well known to play a pivotal role in multiple signaling events (33Parton R.G. Simons K. The multiple faces of caveolae.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 8: 185-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (1155) Google Scholar). One of the highly studied signaling pathways related to caveolae is generation of NO through eNOS (34Mineo C. Shaul P.W. Regulation of eNOS in caveolae.Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 2012; 729: 51-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). To elucidate the functional role of Cavin-2 in endothelial cells, we knocked down Cavin-2 in HUVECs and checked for the expression of eNOS. Interestingly, we found that the total protein levels of eNOS were decreased upon Cavin-2 knockdown in HUVECs cultured in complete endothelial cell growth medium (EGM-2) (Fig. 6A). Akt phosphorylation at serine 1177 activates eNOS that leads to NO production in endothelial cells (35Fulton D. Gratton J.P. McCabe T.J. Fontana J. Fujio Y. Walsh K. Franke T.F. Papapetropoulos A.

To study whether Cavin-2 plays an important role in the stability and activity of eNOS, we followed the total eNOS and activated form of eNOS (Ser(P)-1177) during VEGF signaling. HUVECs were knocked down with Cavin-2 and control siRNAs, incubated for 10–12 h with EGM-2 media without only supplemental growth factors, treated with VEGF, and harvested at different time points up to 3 h (Fig. 6B). In control knockdown cells, the activity of eNOS at 15 min and later time points when compared with 0 min clearly indicate the activation of the VEGF pathway. Strikingly, we find that eNOS is not active even after multiple time points of VEGF activation in siCavin-2. This is quite interesting as none of the caveolar proteins’ deficit is implicated in the loss of eNOS activity. The total protein levels of eNOS after the loss of Cavin-2 is reduced in earlier time points when compared with the control. Quite interestingly, the total eNOS levels were also strikingly declined in later time points, at around 3 h, most of the eNOS is degraded (Fig. 6B, second blot from top). Densitometry based quantitation of the phospho-eNOS in two independent experiments clearly show that the activity of eNOS is decreased by more than 5-fold (4.32 ± 0.608 versus 0.811 ± 0.268) in siCavin-2 cells at 15 min, where the activity of eNOS is at the highest in control (Fig. 6C). The quantification of total eNOS shows that there is a decrease in the total eNOS protein levels in the control cells, 3 h post-stimulation. There is more than a 4-fold (0.804 ± 0.015 versus 0.182 ± 0.061) decrease in total eNOS levels in Cavin-2 knockdown cells when compared with the control (Fig. 6D). These experiments clearly show that the loss of Cavin-2 significantly decreases the activity and stability of eNOS in HUVECs. We anticipated that the loss of eNOS activity upon Cavin-2 loss should decrease the total amount of NO produced in the endothelial cells. To measure the"

The mean spherical equivalent was -3.19±2.31 diopters, and the mean deviation (MD) of the central 24/30-2 threshold test using the Humphrey Field Analyzer (HFA) was -10.47±7.99 dB. The correlations between the disappearance angle of the RPCs on OTC images, flow density (FD) and the circumpapillary retinal nerve fiber layer (cpRNFL) thickness, the angle of retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) defect, the MD and pattern standard deviation (PSD) values of the HFA central 24/30-2 threshold test using the Swedish interactive thresholding algorithm, the sensitivity threshold, age, corneal thickness, and refractive value were analyzed. In addition, the correlation between FD and the cpRNFL thickness was analyzed at FD measurement points.FD was significantly correlated with cpRNFL thickness, PSD value, MD value, and sensitivity threshold, whereas the disappearance angle of the RPCs was significantly correlated with the angle of the RNFL defect (P<0.001), MD value (P<0.01), and sensitivity threshold (P<0.01). There was a negative correlation between FD and age (P<0.05). The Pearson correlation coefficient of FD and cpRNFL thickness in the area surrounding the optic disc revealed the most significant correlation in the inferior visual field (r = 0.851, P<0.001), followed by the superior visual field (r = 0.803, P<0.001) and then the temporal visual field (r = 0.653, P<0.001).SD-OCT angiography enabled thorough observation of the RPCs. FD and the disappearance angle of the RPCs were significantly and independently correlated with glaucoma-related functional and morphological changes in the optic nerve, suggesting that these two factors are novel functional and morphological indicators of visual defects due to glaucoma."

Moreover, the amplitude, duration, and shape of the synaptic response was tightly controlled by plasma membrane glutamate transporters, indicating that clearance of synaptic glutamate during the slow EPSC is dictated by an uptake process. AMPA receptors (AMPARs) mediate the majority of fast excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) in the brain (Jonas, 2000Jonas P. The time course of signaling at central glutamatergic synapses.News Physiol. Sci. 2000; 15: 83-89PubMed Google Scholar). The brevity of EPSCs and rapid deactivation of AMPARs depend upon a short lifetime of synaptically released glutamate, estimated to be about 1 ms (Clements et al., 1992Clements J.D. Lester R.A.

Another key factor contributing to fast AMPAR-mediated EPSCs is rapid desensitization, which decreases response amplitudes by >90% within ∼10 ms upon prolonged exposure to glutamate (Colquhoun et al., 1992Colquhoun D.

Thus, even when cleft glutamate clearance is slow, desensitization still forces AMPAR-mediated EPSCs to decay quickly (Trussell et al., 1993Trussell L.O. Zhang S. Raman I.M.

In stark contrast to this picture of typical AMPAR synapses is the large mossy fiber-unipolar brush cell (UBC) synapse in the granular layer of cerebellar cortex and cochlear nucleus (Floris et al., 1994Floris A.

Stimulation of this synapse evokes typical fast EPSCs, but these are followed by a slow, AMPAR-mediated EPSC lasting hundreds of milliseconds (Borges-Merjane and Trussell, 2015Borges-Merjane C.

The mossy fiber-UBC synapse features an extensive, convoluted synaptic cleft between the presynaptic terminal and postsynaptic brush-like dendrite (Rossi et al., 1995Rossi D.J. Alford S. Mugnaini E. Slater N.T. Properties of transmission at a giant glutamatergic synapse in cerebellum: the mossy fiber-unipolar brush cell synapse.J.

Prolonged physiological entrapment of glutamate in the synaptic cleft of cerebellar unipolar brush cells.J. Neurophysiol. 1997; 78: 1320-1333Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar proposed that the slow current is the combined result of delayed clearance from this large synaptic cleft and the biophysical properties of AMPARs. Upon such prolonged glutamate exposure, synaptic AMPARs would enter steady-state desensitization and occasionally reopen, generating the slow EPSC. However, direct evidence for “glutamate entrapment” (Rossi et al., 1995Rossi D.J. Alford S. Mugnaini E. Slater N.T. Properties of transmission at a giant glutamatergic synapse in cerebellum: the mossy fiber-unipolar brush cell synapse.J. Neurophysiol. 1995; 74: 24-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) requires information about the kinetic state of receptors during synaptic transmission, their molecular properties, and the forces that determine the glutamate lifetime in the cleft. We tested this hypothesis in UBCs of the vestibular cerebellum. Fast UV uncaging of glutamate after synaptic stimuli revealed that after exocytosis of glutamate, >90% of AMPARs become desensitized. Thereafter, receptors slowly recover from desensitization concurrent with an increase in the EPSC amplitude. Dose-response relations show that AMPARs produce smaller equilibrium responses to millimolar levels of glutamate than to micromolar levels, suggesting that the slow EPSC tracks recovery from desensitization as glutamate is removed. This decrease in response to high glutamate levels was absent in UBCs from γ2 transmembrane AMPAR regulatory protein (TARP) mutant stargazer (stg) mice, and slow EPSCs in these mice were reduced in amplitude. Finally, the slow time course of glutamate was dictated by glutamate transporters, as block of transport profoundly distorted synaptic responses. Thus, at the mossy-fiber-UBC synapse, exocytosis initiates a process of transmission controlled by a balance between glutamate uptake and the heightened sensitivity to transmitter bestowed by TARPs. The fast-then-slow EPSC sequence that is characteristic of UBCs was evoked by a 100-Hz, 10-stimulus train in mouse cerebellar brain slices (STAR Methods; Figures 1A and 1B ) (Borges-Merjane and Trussell, 2015Borges-Merjane C.

A complete block of the EPSC by GYKI-53655 (GYKI) (75 μM) confirmed that the slow currents were AMPAR mediated (Figure 1B). As previously described, the slow current increases the firing rate of UBCs (Figure 1B; Borges-Merjane and Trussell, 2015Borges-Merjane C. Trussell L.O.

In 17 cells tested, amplitudes of fast EPSCs depressed rapidly and nearly completely during train stimulation (fit to decay of peak amplitudes: fast decay τ: 9.7 ± 7.7 ms, slow decay τ: 18.5 ± 2.0 ms, fast component 55% of total; average of EPSC5–10/EPSC1: 4.3% ± 0.5%; Figures 1C and 1D). Following strong synaptic depression, a slow EPSC emerged after stimuli were terminated, reaching a peak of 13.6 ± 1.5 pA (19.1% ± 5.0% of EPSC1) 130.1 ± 9.0 ms after the train stimulation and decaying with a τ of 453.5 ± 53.5 ms back to baseline (Figures 1C and 1E). The slow EPSC generated a charge transfer seven times that of all prior fast EPSCs plus the tonic current between each fast EPSC (charge transferred during fast EPSCs: 1.1 ± 0.1 pC, slow EPSC: 7.6 ± 1.1 pC, n = 17). Thus, the slow EPSC was the dominant synaptic signal. The slow EPSC may be a spillover current mediated by extrasynaptic receptors (Nielsen et al., 2004Nielsen T.A. DiGregorio D.A. Silver R.A. Modulation of glutamate mobility reveals the mechanism underlying slow-rising AMPAR EPSCs and the diffusion coefficient in the synaptic cleft.Neuron. 2004; 42: 757-771Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). If this is the case, one would expect the slow EPSC to begin during a long stimulus train as accumulated glutamate spilled out to distant receptors. However, when we varied the number of stimuli, the slowly rising EPSC was observed to begin only after the termination of stimulation (Figure 1E). Furthermore, the current’s rise time after stimuli were halted was constant, regardless of the number of stimuli (range 5–100 stimuli; p = 0.24, R2 = 0.06, linear regression fit; Figure 1F). This result argues against the spillover hypothesis, as such diffusion should not depend upon the cessation of transmitter release. Rather, the results indicate that synaptic AMPARs were partially inhibited by glutamate accumulated in the synaptic cleft, and this inhibition is relieved as transmitter levels gradually decline (Kinney et al., 1997Kinney G.A. Overstreet L.S. Slater N.T. Prolonged physiological entrapment of glutamate in the synaptic cleft of cerebellar unipolar brush cells.J. Neurophysiol. 1997; 78: 1320-1333Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). If indeed the slow EPSC time course arises as glutamate gradually falls, its decay should be prolonged by restricting the diffusion time of glutamate. We thus applied 5% dextran in the bath solution to increase the viscosity of extracellular space and retard transmitter diffusion (Min et al., 1998Min M.-Y. Rusakov D.A. Kullmann D.M. Activation of AMPA, kainate, and metabotropic receptors at hippocampal mossy fiber synapses: role of glutamate diffusion.Neuron. 1998; 21: 561-570Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). After 15 min in dextran, the time to peak and decay time constant of the slow EPSC were prolonged (time to peak: from 135.0 ± 12.0 to 214.3 ± 38.5 ms, p = 0.03, n = 8; decay time constant: from 464.5 ± 74.2 to 688.9 ± 125.7 ms, p = 0.007, n = 8; paired t tests), confirming that the mossy fiber-UBC cleft limits the clearance of transmitter (Figures 1G and 1H). The prolongation of the slow EPSC by dextran indicates a role for diffusion in controlling the clearance of glutamate but does not exclude that glial or neuronal glutamate transporters might also affect glutamate decay. We thus tested the role of transporters using the selective blocker TBOA and found a striking dose-dependent effect on the EPSC. At the highest TBOA dose examined (50 μM), the rise time of the slow EPSC was lengthened over 3-fold and the decay time lengthened over 2-fold over control (Figures 2A, 2C, and 2D ). By contrast, the fast EPSC elicited by the first stimulus in the train was only slightly slower at the same concentration (Figures 2G–2J). Coincident with these actions, however, was a significant increase in inward holding current even with 10 μM TBOA (Figures 2A and 2E); this current was abolished by subsequent application of GYKI and therefore must represent tonic activation of AMPAR by ambient glutamate (Figure 2A). Given the sensitivity of AMPARs, ambient glutamate may cause tonic AMPAR desensitization. Indeed, we observed an ∼40% reduction in the peak amplitude of the first fast EPSC in 50 μM TBOA (Figures 2G and 2I). Moreover, there was an apparent interaction between the tonic current and the steady-state current during synaptic activation: the steady-state current was slightly less inward (relative to the baseline current level before stimulation) in 10 μM TBOA compared to control and became clearly outward (relative to baseline) in 50 μM TBOA (Figures 2B and 2F; 6 of 8 cells tested). Following the stimuli, the slow EPSC then emerged, becoming inward again before finally settling back to the baseline defined by the tonic current (Figures 2A and 2B). Subsequent application of GYKI blocked this complex synaptic waveform (Figure 2A). Thus, loss of transporter activity slowed the synaptic response and led to accumulation of ambient glutamate, generating a tonic current. The ongoing exocytosis associated with the train stimuli further desensitized the AMPARs, leading to the apparent outward current. Therefore, a function of the transporters is not only to narrow the EPSC time course, but to limit both glutamate accumulation at rest and receptor desensitization during stimuli. The delayed onset of the slow EPSC, and the appearance of an outward current when transporters are blocked, strongly suggests that synaptic transmission at the UBC synapse is accompanied by significant desensitization of AMPARs. We used glutamate uncaging to directly observe the magnitude of desensitization and its recovery during the EPSC. MNI-glutamate (1 mM) was bath applied, and a 2-ms UV flash was delivered over the UBC brush to locally uncage glutamate (Figure 3A); this method was combined with synaptic stimulation at varying intervals. As the flash area contains the compact region of the brush, we expect it to activate all synaptic receptors. Control experiments confirmed that AMPARs were largely restricted to the brush region and that uncaged glutamate accessed synaptic receptors (STAR Methods; Figure S1). We found that the peak of the fast transient uncaging response (uEPSC) was greatly reduced when evoked closer to the end of train stimulation (Figures 3B and 3C), with maximal decrease of the test pulse of over 90%. Furthermore, the uEPSC gradually recovered as the synaptic-uncaging stimulus intervals increased, with a τ of 267.1 ± 24.4 ms (Figure 3C; n = 6). A similar phenomenon was also observed using a paired-uncaging pulse protocol, in which the peak uEPSC evoked by the second uncaging pulse recovered with a τ of 413.9 ± 68.1 ms (Figures 3E and 3F; n = 8). Assuming the concentration of uncaged glutamate is similar in each trial (see STAR Methods), the reduction in peak uEPSC is most easily explained by desensitization of AMPARs. As uncaging activates the same set of receptors utilized by synaptic transmission, we conclude that synaptically released glutamate desensitizes AMPARs, and this desensitization is maximal at the end of the last stimulus. The initial rise in the slow EPSC after stimuli cease must be generated by a decline in cleft glutamate occurring simultaneously with recovery from desensitization. This explains two observations. First, an “undershoot” of current was seen right after uncaging, most obvious near the peak of the slow EPSC (Figures 3B and 3E). This undershoot current always reached a level similar to the current level just after the last synaptic stimulus and was followed by its own rise and fall in slow current (Figures 3B and 3E). Thus, cleft glutamate increased upon uncaging, further desensitized the receptors, and then evoked a slow EPSC as glutamate levels subsequently declined. Second, when uncaging pulses were applied at the beginning of the rise of the slow EPSC or at a later point when current had fallen back to the same level, the uncaging responses were distinctly different (Figure 3B, inset). Plotting baseline current just before an uncaging pulse against the fractional recovery of the uncaging response from desensitization revealed a bell-shaped relation, with a maximum at ∼40% recovery (Figures 3D and 3G). As the slow EPSC peaked when ∼60% of AMPARs were desensitized, this result suggests that an intermediate glutamate concentration was retained in the synaptic cleft during the slow EPSC. Thus, the slow EPSC was mediated by AMPARs that reopened as they recovered from desensitization. The ability of AMPARs to produce larger currents in response to falling levels of transmitter implies a molecular specialization for non-monotonic sensitivity to glutamate. TARP co-expression is associated with reduced desensitization and enhanced steady-state AMPAR currents (Jackson and Nicoll, 2011Jackson A.C. Nicoll R.A.

Regulation of ionotropic glutamate receptors by their auxiliary subunits.Physiology (Bethesda). 2010; 25: 41-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). To test for a role of TARPs in the slow EPSC, we recorded EPSCs in UBCs from stg mice, which lack γ2 TARP (Letts et al., 1998Letts V.A. Felix R. Biddlecome G.H. Arikkath J. Mahaffey C.L. Valenzuela A. Bartlett 2nd, F.S. Mori Y. Campbell K.P. Frankel W.N. The mouse stargazer gene encodes a neuronal Ca2+-channel γ subunit.Nat. Genet. 1998; 19: 340-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar), comparing their amplitudes to those of wild-type (WT) mice. EPSCs in stg UBCs showed both fast and slow components upon train stimulation, as in WT UBCs (Figures 4A and 4B ). Scatterplots of peak amplitude of fast EPSCs versus slow EPSCs from different UBCs were positively correlated (R2 = 0.163; p = 0.0027, n = 53), presumably as synapses varied in their size, quantal content, and numbers of AMPARs (Zampini et al., 2016Zampini V. Liu J.K. Diana M.A. Maldonado P.P. Brunel N. Dieudonné S. Mechanisms and functional roles of glutamatergic synapse diversity in a cerebellar circuit.eLife. 2016; 5: e15872Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). However, when plotted for each mouse line, stg slow currents appeared to be smaller than in WT over a similar range of fast EPSCs (Figures 4A and 4B, red versus black traces and points). Given that some of the variance in the population was accounted for by a correlation between EPSC amplitudes, we used permutation tests to determine whether WT and stg synapses differed in the amplitudes of slow EPSCs and fast EPSCs and in their slow/fast ratios (see STAR Methods). Slow EPSC amplitudes were ∼50% smaller in stg UBCs than in WT UBCs (stg median: 5.74 pA, inter-quartile range (IQR): 3.66–6.47 pA, n = 21; WT median: 11.62 pA, IQR: 8.42–17.79 pA, n = 32; permutation test, p < 0.0001). Fast EPSCs were also significantly smaller in stg UBCs, but the difference between medians was smaller than for slow EPSCs (∼29%), (stg median: 48.33 pA, IQR: 43.5–66.45 pA, n = 21; WT median: 68.47 pA, IQR: 54.51–90.11 pA, n = 32; permutation test, p = 0.0099). The ratio of the slow/fast EPSCs were used to determine whether the slow EPSCs were generally more affected by the stg mutation than the fast EPSC. Indeed, the slow/fast EPSC ratios were significantly smaller in stg UBCs, indicating that AMPARs in the stg mutant mice have a reduced ability to generate the slow EPSC (stg median: 0.09, IQR: 0.06–0.14, n = 21; WT median: 0.15, IQR: 0.10–0.23, n = 32; permutation test, p = 0.0133), and suggested a key role for stargazin in boosting sensitivity of the receptors to the slow synaptic glutamate transients at the UBC synapse. A striking effect of heterologous TARP expression on AMPAR function is a bell-shaped glutamate dose-response relation, termed “auto-inactivation” (Morimoto-Tomita et al., 2009Morimoto-Tomita M.

Given that the slow EPSC rises as cleft glutamate decays, and that TARPs support this slow current, we expected that WT, but not stg, UBCs might feature a non-monotonic sensitivity to glutamate. UBCs enzymatically isolated with intact brush dendrites were used for constructing dose-response relations (Figure 4C), as glutamate transporters in slices may limit the access of exogenous glutamate to receptors. As shown in Figures 4D–4F, when 1 μM glutamate was applied to the cell, a steady current was generated without apparent desensitization. A fast transient current could be observed at higher glutamate levels (32–1,000 μM), which quickly desensitized and reached steady state. This steady-state response is presumed to originate from bound AMPARs at microscopic equilibrium between open, closed, and desensitized states. Absolute and normalized steady-state responses at different glutamate concentrations are shown in Figures 4E and 4F. The steady-state response increased with glutamate concentration up to ∼32 μM (156.1% ± 0.1% of the 1 mM response, n = 9), and mean absolute values for currents at 32 μM were significantly larger than at 1 mM (n = 9, p = 0.004, paired t test). These experiments were then repeated on stg UBCs and revealed clear differences with WT UBCs. Maximal steady-state current was about half that of WT (Figure 4E; e.g., at 32 μM, WT: 11.5 ± 1.6 pA, n = 9; stg: 4.8 ± 0.7 pA, n = 7, p = 0.004, unpaired t test). These values at 32 μM were comparable to the peak amplitude of the slow EPSC within the same genotype (WT: p = 0.95; stg: p = 0.30, unpaired t tests). Notably, the shape of the stg dose-response relation was monotonic (Figure 4F), such that responses at 32 μM, normalized to responses for 1 mM, were not significantly different from 1 (p = 0.83, one-sample t test). Overall, in comparing the normalized curves between WT and stg, significant differences were observed for responses to 1, 10, 32, and 100 μM glutamate (p = 0.04–0.004). Together, these data indicate that stg mice have reduced sensitivity to glutamate, particularly in the range of 1–100 μM that would normally give rise to the non-monotonic dose-response curve, suggesting that the reduced slow EPSC reflects an inability of the AMPARs to give a rebound response as synaptic glutamate decays. This study showed that the slow EPSC of UBCs is determined by two factors. Continual transporter activity controls the time course of the EPSC, the depth of desensitization, and the baseline level of glutamate in the synaptic cleft. Moreover, a TARP-containing AMPAR renders the cell sensitive to the slowly changing levels of glutamate established by the transporters. In the absence of transport, glutamate levels fall extremely slowly and never reach a level below the sensitivity of the AMPAR, highlighting the “entrapment” hypothesis originally proposed by Rossi et al., 1995Rossi D.J.

This situation is dramatically different from that of mossy fiber synapses made onto granule cells or of fenestrated calyceal synapses, both of which have exclusively fast phasic AMPAR-mediated transmission even after transporter blockade (Renden et al., 2005Renden R.

This study demonstrates a very different role for desensitization. In UBCs, recovery from desensitization of TARP-containing AMPARs during slowly changing levels of transmitter leads to sizeable currents and accounts for a large fraction of transmitter action. Moreover, the balance between open and desensitized states is regulated by glutamate transporters, such that loss of transport reduces inward excitatory current during synaptic stimuli by enhancing desensitization. In this way, the UBC synapse can more effectively integrate presynaptic activity over longer periods of time than wou"
https://openalex.org/W2755551844,"Gorlin syndrome is a genetic disorder of autosomal dominant inheritance that predisposes the affected individual to a variety of disorders that are attributed largely to heterozygous germline patched1 (PTCH1) mutations. PTCH1 is a hedgehog (Hh) receptor as well as a repressor, mutation of which leads to constitutive activation of Hh pathway. Hh pathway encompasses a wide variety of cellular signaling cascades, which involve several molecules; however, no associated genotype-phenotype correlations have been reported. Recently, mutations in Suppressor of fused homolog (SUFU) or PTCH2 were reported in patients with Gorlin syndrome. These facts suggest that multi-layered mutations in Hh pathway may contribute to the development of Gorlin syndrome. We demonstrated multiple mutations of Hh-related genes in addition to PTCH1, which possibly act in an additive or multiplicative manner and lead to Gorlin syndrome. High-throughput sequencing was performed to analyze exome sequences in four unrelated Gorlin syndrome patient genomes. Mutations in PTCH1 gene were detected in all four patients. Specific nucleotide variations or frameshift variations of PTCH1 were identified along with the inferred amino acid changes in all patients. We further filtered 84 different genes which are closely related to Hh signaling. Fifty three of these had enough coverage of over ×30. The sequencing results were filtered and compared to reduce the number of sequence variants identified in each of the affected individuals. We discovered three genes, PTCH2, BOC, and WNT9b, with mutations with a predicted functional impact assessed by MutationTaster2 or PolyPhen-2 (Polymorphism Phenotyping v2) analysis. It is noticeable that PTCH2 and BOC are Hh receptor molecules. No significant mutations were observed in SUFU. Multi-layered mutations in Hh pathway may change the activation level of the Hh signals, which may explain the wide phenotypic variability of Gorlin syndrome."

Here we use ChIP sequencing (ChIP-seq) to identify domains enriched for the histone marks histone H3 lysine 4 trimethylation, histone H3 lysine 4 monomethylation, and histone H3 lysine 27 acetylation (H3K4me3, H3K4me1, and H3K27ac) and define, for the first time, the super enhancers and typical enhancers active in primary human corneal epithelial cells. We show that regulatory regions are often shared between cell types of the ectodermal lineage and that corneal epithelial super enhancers are already marked as potential regulatory domains in embryonic stem cells. Kruppel-like factor (KLF) motifs were enriched in corneal epithelial enhancers, consistent with the important roles of KLF4 and KLF5 in promoting corneal epithelial differentiation. We now show that the Kruppel family member KLF7 promotes the corneal progenitor cell state; on many genes, KLF7 antagonized the corneal differentiation–promoting KLF4. Furthermore, we found that two SNPs linked previously to corneal diseases, astigmatism, and Stevens-Johnson syndrome fall within corneal epithelial enhancers and alter their activity by disrupting transcription factor motifs that overlap these SNPs. Taken together, our work defines regulatory enhancers in corneal epithelial cells, highlights global gene-regulatory relationships shared among different epithelial cells, identifies a role for KLF7 as a KLF4 antagonist in corneal epithelial cell differentiation, and explains how two SNPs may contribute to corneal diseases.

https://openalex.org/W2756151820,"The purpose of this study was to determine the incidence of an anterior extension of the parotid gland, such as an accessory parotid gland (APG) or facial process (FP) and to evaluate its characteristics on computed tomography (CT) scans. We reviewed CT scans of 1,600 parotid glands from 800 patients. An APG on CT was defined as a soft-tissue mass of the same density as the main parotid gland, located at the anterior part of the main parotid gland, and completely separate from the main parotid gland. An FP was defined as a lobe of the parotid gland protruding anteriorly over the anterior edge of the ramus of the mandible on CT and showing continuity with the main gland. The overall incidence rates and characteristics of APGs and FPs were evaluated according to age, sex, and side. The incidence rates of APGs and FPs were 10.2% (163/1,600) and 28.3% (452/1,600), respectively. The mean size of an APG was 15.8 mm × 5.0 mm and the mean distance from the main parotid gland was 10.5 mm. The FP reached anteriorly between the anterior edge of the mandibular ramus and the anterior border of the masseter muscle in 405 (89.6%) cases, while it extended over the anterior border of the masseter muscle in 47 (10.4%) cases. The incidence rates of APGs and FPs decreased and increased, respectively, with increasing age, showing significant linear correlations. However, the incidence of an anterior extension of the parotid gland (either an APG or an FP) was similar across all age groups. The present study showed that CT might be helpful in identifying anterior extensions of the parotid gland including APGs and FPs. The anatomical information gained from this study contributes to a better understanding of APGs and FPs and how their incidence changes with age."

GnRH vaccination has been promoted as a non-invasive contraceptive measure for population management of overabundant wildlife. We tested the efficacy of this treatment for fertility control in elephant bulls.In total, 17 male African elephants that were treated with a GnRH vaccine were examined in two groups. In the prospective study group 1 (n = 11 bulls, ages: 8-36 years), semen quality, the testes, seminal vesicles, ampullae and prostate, which were all measured by means of transrectal ultrasound, and faecal androgen metabolite concentrations were monitored over a three-year period. Each bull in the prospective study received 5 ml of Improvac® (1000 μg GnRH conjugate) intramuscularly after the first examination, followed by a booster six weeks later and thereafter every 5-7 months. In a retrospective study group (group 2, n = 6, ages: 19-33 years), one examination was performed on bulls which had been treated with GnRH vaccine for 5-11 years.In all bulls of group 1, testicular and accessory sex gland sizes decreased significantly after the third vaccination. In six males examined prior to vaccination and again after more than five vaccinations, the testis size was reduced by 57.5%. Mean testicular height and length decreased from 13.3 ± 2.6 cm x 15.2 ± 2.8 cm at the beginning to 7.6 ± 2.1 cm x 10.2 ± 1.8 cm at the end of the study. Post pubertal bulls (>9 years, n = 6) examined prior to vaccination produced ejaculates with viable spermatozoa (volume: 8-175 ml, sperm concentration: 410-4000x106/ml, total motility: 0-90%), while after 5-8 injections, only 50% of these bulls produced ejaculates with a small number of immotile spermatozoa. The ejaculates of group 2 bulls (vaccinated >8 times) were devoid of spermatozoa. Faecal androgen metabolite concentrations measured in captive males decreased significantly after the fourth vaccination. None of the males entered musth during the treatment period.Our results showed a marked decrease in semen quality, testicle and secondary sex gland sizes following repeated GnRH vaccinations. After 2-4 years of continuous treatment every 5-7 months, the effects were similar to surgical castration."

Among several pathways implicated in E-T coupling, activation of voltage-gated L-type Ca2+ channels (LTCCs) in the plasma membrane can initiate a signaling pathway that ultimately increases nuclear CREB phosphorylation and, in most cases, expression of immediate early genes. Initiation of this long-range pathway has been shown to require recruitment of Ca2+-sensitive enzymes to a nanodomain in the immediate vicinity of the LTCC by an unknown mechanism. Here, we show that activated Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) strongly interacts with a novel binding motif in the N-terminal domain of CaV1 LTCC α1 subunits that is not conserved in CaV2 or CaV3 voltage-gated Ca2+ channel subunits. Mutations in the CaV1.3 α1 subunit N-terminal domain or in the CaMKII catalytic domain that largely prevent the in vitro interaction also disrupt CaMKII association with intact LTCC complexes isolated by immunoprecipitation. Furthermore, these same mutations interfere with E-T coupling in cultured hippocampal neurons.

However, as the transplantation is performed without vessel anastomosis, unavoidable ischemic damage occurs. To reduce this ischemic damage and improve outcomes after transplantation, we used two kind of angiogenic factors, angiopoietin-2 (ang-2) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Fresh or vitrified-warmed bovine OTs were prepared for xenotransplantation (XT). Fresh OTs were immediately xenografted into nude mice (XT-Fresh). Vitrified-warmed OTs were xenografted into four subgroups of mice, which were injected intraperitoneally before XT with saline (XT-Vitri), Ang-2 (XT-Ang-2), VEGF (XT-VEGF), and a combination of Ang-2 and VEGF (XT-Combined). Seven or 28 days post-grafting, grafted OTs and blood samples were collected for evaluation. Follicle normality was higher in the angiogenic factor-treated groups than in the XT-Vitri group. The XT-VEGF and the XT-Combined showed higher (P<0.05) follicular density than the XT-Vitri group. The highest apoptotic follicle ratio was observed in the XT-Vitri group on day 7; this was decreased (P<0.05) in the XT-Combined group. Microvessel densities were higher in the angiogenic factor-treated groups than in the XT-Vitri group. The largest fibrotic area was showed in the XT-Vitri group on day 28, and it was decreased (P<0.05) in the XT-combined group. Based on these results, administration of Ang-2 and VEGF to recipients prior to XT appeared to alleviate ischemic damage by enhancing angiogenesis, which resulted in the maintenance of follicle integrity and density, and reduced follicle apoptosis and OT fibrosis."
https://openalex.org/W2756301958,"Although virus release from host cells and tissues propels the spread of many infectious diseases, most virus particles are not infectious; many are defective, lacking essential genetic information needed for replication. When defective and viable particles enter the same cell, the defective particles can multiply while interfering with viable particle production. Defective interfering particles (DIPs) occur in nature, but their role in disease pathogenesis and spread is not known. Here, we engineered an RNA virus and its DIPs to express different fluorescent reporters, and we observed how DIPs impact viral gene expression and infection spread. Across thousands of host cells, co-infected with infectious virus and DIPs, gene expression was highly variable, but average levels of viral reporter expression fell at higher DIP doses. In cell populations spatial patterns of infection spread provided the first direct evidence for the co-transmission of DIPs with infectious virus. Patterns of spread were highly sensitive to the behavior of initial or early co-infected cells, with slower overall spread stemming from higher early DIP doses. Under such conditions striking patterns of patchy gene expression reflected localized regions of DIP or virus enrichment. From a broader perspective, these results suggest DIPs contribute to the ecological and evolutionary persistence of viruses in nature."

In glucose medium, Saccharomyces cerevisiae mutants lacking the function of this complex grow poorly in the absence of amino acid supplementation, despite showing hallmarks of increased TORC1 signaling. Such mutants sense that they are amino acid replete and thus repress metabolic activities that are important for achieving this state. We found that npr2Δ mutants have defective mitochondrial tricarboxylic acid (TCA)-cycle activity and retrograde response. Supplementation with glutamine, and especially aspartate, which are nitrogen-containing forms of TCA-cycle intermediates, rescues growth of npr2Δ mutants. These amino acids are then consumed in biosynthetic pathways that require nitrogen to support proliferative metabolism. Our findings revealed that negative regulators of TORC1, such as GATOR1 (SEACIT), regulate the cataplerotic synthesis of these amino acids from the TCA cycle, in tune with the amino acid and nitrogen status of cells."

For a given sequence, understanding how each of these steps affects observed expression levels may lead to improved strategies for IMP overexpression. Previous work indicates that the Sec-facilitated membrane integration step of biogenesis is a limiting factor in the overexpression of the TatC IMP (2Marshall S.S. Niesen M.J.M. Müller A. Tiemann K.

A link between integral membrane protein expression and simulated integration efficiency.Cell Rep. 2016; 16: 2169-2177Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Sequence changes in the C-tail that alter the efficiency of membrane integration efficiency, determined either from coarse-grained (CG) simulations or experimentally, were shown to correlate with experimentally observed IMP expression levels. Further work is necessary to explore the generality of this link and its potential for enabling the rational enhancement of IMP expression. The current study demonstrates the predictive capacity of simulated integration efficiency for experimental expression by examining a wide range of sequence modifications to TatC homologs across the protein sequence. The studied sequence modifications include point mutations, loop-swap chimeras, and double-loop-swap chimeras, and it is shown that the simulated integration efficiency, as predicted by CG simulations, broadly correlates with IMP expression. An ampicillin resistance assay is employed to directly validate the simulated integration efficiencies and to confirm the mechanistic interpretation. We further demonstrate cumulative and largely independent effect of multiple mutations on both the simulated integration efficiency and the experimentally observed expression levels. Finally, we provide a methodology that can be used to generally identify sequence regions in other IMPs that may exhibit correlations like those elucidated here for TatC, yielding a broadly applicable tool for the computational prediction of sequence modifications that improve IMP overexpression. TatC is an IMP with six transmembrane domains and a cytoplasmic N and C terminus (Fig. 1A) that is a component of the bacterial twin-arginine translocation pathway (22Bogsch E.G. Sargent F. Stanley N.R. Berks B.C. Robinson C. Palmer T. An essential component of a novel bacterial protein export system with homologues in plastids and mitochondria.J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18003-18006Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). A representative pool of 111 loop-swap chimeras was generated by replacing a single loop in one of 10 wild-type TatC homologs (Aquifex aeolicus, Bordetella parapertussis, Campylobacter jejuni,Deinococcus radiodurans, E. coli, Hydrogenivirga species 128-5-R1, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Staphylococcus aureus, Vibrio cholera, and Wolinella succinogenes) with the corresponding loop from one of the other nine homologs (Fig. 1A). Loop domains were identified by sequence alignment and membrane topology predictions (23Tsirigos K.D. Peters C. Shu N. Käll L. Elofsson A.

Both mutant and wild-type expression levels were determined using a C-terminal GFP tag (24Drew D. Slotboom D.J. Friso G. Reda T. Genevaux P. Rapp M. Meindl-Beinker N.M. Lambert W. Lerch M. Daley D.O.

The set of loop swaps exhibit a wide range of values for this experimental expression ratio, as shown in Fig. 1B. The effect of single-loop swaps ranges from 0.02- to 40-fold changes, with 43% of the studied loop swaps yielding improved expression. Control studies were performed to confirm that the C-terminal GFP tag does not substantially alter the experimentally measured expression levels. A set of 11 single-loop-swap chimeras and their corresponding wild-type sequences were cloned into an alternative construct containing an N-terminal Strep tag (WSHPQFEK) with no C-terminal tag (see “Experimental procedures”). The experimental expression ratio in Equation 1 was measured for each N-terminal Strep tag construct and compared against quantification via C-terminal GFP fluorescence. Fig. 1C shows this comparison, revealing agreement for all studied cases between measured expression levels using either tag. This result, additionally supported by extensive studies in which IMP-GFP fluorescence is shown to be a robust quantifier of expression (24Drew D. Slotboom D.J. Friso G. Reda T. Genevaux P. Rapp M.

Correlation between simulated integration efficiency and experimentally observed expression levels was previously identified in TatC based on a limited set of mutations (2Marshall S.S. Niesen M.J.M. Müller A. Tiemann K. Saladi S.M. Galimidi R.P. Zhang B. Clemons Jr., W.M. Miller 3rd, T.F. A link between integral membrane protein expression and simulated integration efficiency.Cell Rep. 2016; 16: 2169-2177Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar); here, we systematically test the predictive capacity of simulated integration efficiency for expression in a diverse set of 111 loop-swap chimeras. CG simulations were performed for each chimera and wild-type sequence (see “Experimental procedures”), and the effect of each mutation on simulated integration efficiency was quantified in terms of the ratio, Simulatedintegration=PCin(mutant)PCin(wildtype)(Eq. 2) where PCin corresponds to the fraction of simulated trajectories for which the C-tail domain is correctly localized with respect to the cell membrane; below, we investigate the use of sequence features other than the C-tail for quantifying integration efficiency. Receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curves (Fig. 2A) (26Swets J.A. Dawes R.M. Monahan J. Better decisions through science.Sci. Am. 2000; 283: 82-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar) provide a statistical measure of the predictive capacity of simulated integration efficiency, with values in excess of 0.5 for the area under the ROC curve (AUC) indicating predictive capacity. ROC curves in Fig. 2A are shown for data sets corresponding to all 111 loop-swap chimeras (blue) and to the subset of 82 loop-swap chimeras that exclude C-tail swaps (green). This plot demonstrates the predictive capacity of simulated integration efficiency for experimental expression, with AUC values exceeding 0.5 beyond 95% statistical confidence. The similarity of the two curves indicates that the predictive capacity of the simulated integration efficiency is relatively insensitive to whether the loop swap involves the C-tail domain. Also, indicated in Fig. 2A (blue and green dots) are the points along the ROC curve that correspond to the cut-off value (defining positive prediction) for the simulated integration efficiency ratio in Equation 2 that offers the greatest predictive capacity for experimentally observed expression; for both data sets, this optimal value is found to be 1.0, indicating that increases or decreases in the simulated integration efficiency straightforwardly predict the corresponding changes in experimental expression levels. To experimentally confirm that the in vivo integration efficiency is correctly described by the CG simulations, we apply a previously developed ampicillin resistance assay (2Marshall S.S. Niesen M.J.M. Müller A. Tiemann K. Saladi S.M. Galimidi R.P. Zhang B. Clemons Jr., W.M. Miller 3rd, T.F. A link between integral membrane protein expression and simulated integration efficiency.Cell Rep. 2016; 16: 2169-2177Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) (see “Experimental procedures”). Upon fusing a C-terminal β-lactamase tag to the TatC sequence, ampicillin resistance is imparted when the C-tail is mislocalized (i.e. oriented into the periplasm) during expression. Therefore, an increase in ampicillin resistance is a direct in vivo test of any decrease in correct C-tail localization predicted from the CG simulations. The survival metric reported in Fig. 2B is the ratio of colonies observed following ampicillin treatment between a loop-swap chimera and the corresponding wild-type TatC sequence. For a subset of 14 loop-swap chimeras, Fig. 2B compares the relative survival to simulated integration efficiency; this subset was selected randomly from the full set of single-loop swap chimeras and includes five C-tail-swap chimeras (sequences listed in supplemental Table 1). For 11 of these 14 cases, the corresponding data points in Fig. 2B fall into the diagonal quadrants of the plot, indicating good agreement between the experimental and simulated measures of integration efficiency (accuracy = 0.8 ± 0.2, 95% confidence interval). Fig. 2C plots the correlation between ampicillin resistance and experimental expression for the same set of loop-swap chimeras. As expected (given the positive correlation between simulated integration efficiency and experimental expression in Fig. 2A and the negative correlation between the simulated integration efficiency and the survival assay in Fig. 2B), Fig. 2C indicates strong negative correlation between ampicillin resistance and experimental expression, with 11 of the 14 data points falling in the diagonal quadrants (accuracy = 0.8 ± 0.2, 95% confidence interval). Taken together, Fig. 2, B and C, demonstrates that simulated integration is a reliable predictor of the C-tail orientation, which is in turn a reliable predictor of experimental expression. Rather than loop-swap mutations, we now consider the effect of single-point mutations on both experimental expression and simulated integration efficiency. Point mutants introduce minimal changes to the wild-type sequence and are often used for protein sequence design (27Magnani F. Shibata Y. Serrano-Vega M.J. Tate C.G.

U.S.A. 2012; 109: 9810-9815Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The blue curve in Fig. 2D shows the ROC curve for a set of 29 point mutants; each exhibits a single mutation at a position in the wild-type sequence that is not universally conserved across homologs, with the mutation either increasing or decreasing the charge at that position (sequences listed in supplemental Table 1). The blue curve in Fig. 2D indicates that the simulated integration efficiencies from the CG method have predictive capacity (AUC = 0.89) that is even higher than was found in Fig. 2A for loop-swap mutations (AUC = 0.65). For comparison, the purple curve in Fig. 2D explores the predictive capacity of a simpler measure of integration efficiency based only on the positive inside rule, which observes that positively charged residues are more likely to be localized to the cytosolic side of the cell membrane (30Heijne G. The distribution of positively charged residues in bacterial inner membrane proteins correlates with the trans-membrane topology.EMBO J. 1986; 5: 3021-3027Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and that modification of the positively charged residues can change IMP topology (19Woodall N.B. Yin Y. Bowie J.U. Dual-topology insertion of a dual-topology membrane protein.Nat. Commun. 2015; 6: 8099Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 20Van Lehn R.C. Zhang B. Miller 3rd, T.F.

Lloris-Garcerá P. Rapp M. von Heijne G. Control of membrane protein topology by a single C-terminal residue.Science. 2010; 328: 1698-1700Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). As employed here, the positive inside rule simply predicts that a mutation will have increased integration efficiency (and thus a positive effect on expression) if it increases the net charge of the cytosolic loops minus the net charge of the periplasmic loops, and vice versa. It is clear from the Fig. 2D that in contrast to the prediction of the CG model (blue), the positive inside rule has little predictive capacity for expression when employed in this way. These results emphasize that the molecular processes and interactions that govern IMP integration are more complex, and they are more completely described using the CG simulations than by simple analysis of charged residues. To determine whether multiple sequence modifications have a combinatory effect on expression and simulated integration efficiency, a set of 12 double-loop-swap chimeras was generated (sequences listed in supplemental Table 1) and tested against the corresponding effect of the constituent single-loop-swap mutations. Fig. 3 shows that for both simulated integration efficiency (A) and experimental expression (B), comparison of the -fold change (Equations 1 and 2) observed for the double-loop-swap chimera is strongly correlated with the product of -fold changes for the corresponding single-loop-swap chimeras (Pearson's correlation coefficient, r = 0.9). Linear fits of the data are plotted as solid lines. The slope of the linear fits for both simulated integration efficiency (Fig. 3A, slope = 0.8) and experimental expression (Fig. 3B, slope = 0.7) deviate only slightly from unity, indicating that the effect of each mutation is largely independent. The results in Fig. 3 suggest that the introduction of multiple mutations is a viable strategy for enhancing expression and that simulated integration efficiency largely captures the effect of these multiple mutations. Using the fraction of CG trajectories for which the TatC C-tail reaches correct localization with respect to the membrane as the measure of successful IMP integration, the results in Fig. 2, along with previous work (2Marshall S.S. Niesen M.J.M. Müller A. Tiemann K. Saladi S.M. Galimidi R.P. Zhang B. Clemons Jr., W.M. Miller 3rd, T.F. A link between integral membrane protein expression and simulated integration efficiency.Cell Rep. 2016; 16: 2169-2177Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), support the conclusion that simulated integration efficiency reliably predicts experimental expression in TatC. However, other features of the TatC topology (such as the localization of other soluble loops) could have been employed to quantify IMP integration from the CG simulations. We now investigate the predictive capacity of the CG simulations for experimental expression, using alterative measures of IMP integration. The alternative measures of IMP integration that are considered include 1) p(i), the fraction of CG trajectories for which soluble loop i reaches correct localization with the respect to the membrane, 2) p(All), the fraction of CG trajectories for which all soluble loops reach correct localization, and 3) p(N), the fraction of CG trajectories for which correct localization is achieved for the soluble loop that includes the mutation. In this notation, the previously discussed measure of IMP integration based on the C-tail is given by p(7). Using each of these measures of IMP integration, we obtained ROC curves that compare the simulated integration efficiency with observed experimental expression, and the corresponding AUC values are presented in Fig. 4A. In all cases, the ROC curves were determined using the data set with all 140 TatC loop-swap and point mutations discussed above. The AUC for the C-tail measure (p(7)) is 0.73, indicating the strong predictive capacity of this measure. However, it is clear that all other measures of integration efficiency fail to offer predictive capacity (yielding AUC values that are within 95% confidence of 0.5). Even when the measure of integration efficiency is based on the localization of the loop in which the mutation occurs (i.e. p(N)), the predictive capacity is significantly worse than using the C-tail (i.e. p(7)). The results in Fig. 4A raise the question of the underlying mechanism for the predictive capacity of the C-tail localization for TatC. One hypothesis is that the C-tail acts as “aggregator” of all preceding errors in the IMP integration, providing a cumulative report on the TatC topology. A second hypothesis is that the C-tail is akin to a “canary in the coal mine,” particularly sensitive to mutations, regardless of where in the sequence the mutation occurs. Finally, a third hypothesis is that the unique features of the C-tail could make it more amenable to accurate description by the CG method than the other TatC loops. We directly tested the aggregator hypothesis by investigating the degree to which the C-tail measure of integration efficiency is predictive of the alternative measures. Fig. 4B presents the resulting AUC values, obtained from ROC curves for p(7) versus the alternative measures, using the full data set of 140 TatC loop-swap and point mutations. It is clear from the figure that there is no significant correlation between p(7) and the other measures, a finding that is inconsistent with the aggregator hypothesis. Fig. 4 (both A and B) emphasizes that the C-tail is a unique reporter of TatC integration efficiency, at least among the diverse set of measures considered here. The second hypothesis reasons that the C-tail of TatC is particularly sensitive to sequence modification and is thus a useful reporter of integration efficiency, regardless of where in the sequence the mutation occurs. Although this hypothesis is difficult to test directly, it is consistent with the results from the ampicillin resistance assay, which found that C-tail localization was substantially impacted by mutations in other parts of the TatC sequence, even for mutations in other loops. Possibly contributing to the conformational sensitivity of the C-tail is that the preceding TM domains (TM5 and TM6) are relatively short and do not fully span the cell membrane in the A. aeolicus TatC (AaTatC) structure (32Ramasamy S. Abrol R. Suloway C.J. Clemons Jr., W.M.

With regard to the third hypothesis, we note that the CG model does not explicitly describe sequence-specific interactions and packing effects among the TM domains; the model is thus expected to be most reliable for describing the topology of TM domains with weak tertiary interactions, such as the C-tail of TatC (32Ramasamy S.

https://openalex.org/W2755953084,"Previous research in spatial cognition has often relied on simple spatial tasks in static environments in order to draw inferences regarding navigation performance. These tasks are typically divided into categories (e.g., egocentric or allocentric) that reflect different two-systems theories. Unfortunately, this two-systems approach has been insufficient for reliably predicting navigation performance in virtual reality (VR). In the present experiment, participants were asked to learn and navigate towards goal locations in a virtual city and then perform eight simple spatial tasks in a separate environment. These eight tasks were organised along four orthogonal dimensions (static/dynamic, perceived/remembered, egocentric/allocentric, and distance/direction). We employed confirmatory and exploratory analyses in order to assess the relationship between navigation performance and performances on these simple tasks. We provide evidence that a dynamic task (i.e., intercepting a moving object) is capable of predicting navigation performance in a familiar virtual environment better than several categories of static tasks. These results have important implications for studies on navigation in VR that tend to over-emphasise the role of spatial memory. Given that our dynamic tasks required efficient interaction with the human interface device (HID), they were more closely aligned with the perceptuomotor processes associated with locomotion than wayfinding. In the future, researchers should consider training participants on HIDs using a dynamic task prior to conducting a navigation experiment. Performances on dynamic tasks should also be assessed in order to avoid confounding skill with an HID and spatial knowledge acquisition."
https://openalex.org/W2296632844,"Topological surgery is a mathematical technique used for creating new manifolds out of known ones. We observe that it occurs in natural phenomena where a sphere of dimension 0 or 1 is selected, forces are applied and the manifold in which they occur changes type. For example, 1-dimensional surgery happens during chromosomal crossover, DNA recombination and when cosmic magnetic lines reconnect, while 2-dimensional surgery happens in the formation of tornadoes, in the phenomenon of Falaco solitons, in drop coalescence and in the cell mitosis. Inspired by such phenomena, we introduce new theoretical concepts which enhance topological surgery with the observed forces and dynamics. To do this, we first extend the formal definition to a continuous process caused by local forces. Next, for modeling phenomena which do not happen on arcs or surfaces but are 2-dimensional or 3-dimensional, we fill in the interior space by defining the notion of solid topological surgery. We further introduce the notion of embedded surgery in S3 for modeling phenomena which involve more intrinsically the ambient space, such as the appearance of knotting in DNA and phenomena where the causes and effect of the process lies beyond the initial manifold, such as the formation of black holes. Finally, we connect these new theoretical concepts with a dynamical system and we present it as a model for both 2-dimensional 0-surgery and natural phenomena exhibiting a ‘hole drilling’ behavior. We hope that through this study, topology and dynamics of many natural phenomena, as well as topological surgery itself, will be better understood."

In total, 117717 gobiids were identified and classified. The occurrence of all three species varied strongly between sampling years, and species-specific activity triggers were identified. The activity of juveniles of all three gobiids species was positively temperature dependent while adult tubenose goby activity appeared to be negatively temperature dependent. Increasing fluvial discharge in the adjoining main river stimulated the activity of juvenile round goby but inhibited activity of adult tubenose goby. Except for adult bighead goby, activity was also structured by time of day, but with no uniform mean. Meteorological factors such as precipitation, air pressure and duration of sunshine hours had little or no influence on gobiid activity. On selected rare occasions, mainly at night, all three species exhibited pulsed swarming behaviour, with thousands of individuals recorded in the intake water. Round goby swarms exhibited both the highest intensity and the largest swarming individuals, suggesting a potential competitive advantage over tubenose and bighead goby. Electric fishing surveys in natural river stretches corroborated this observation. Negative effects on the native fish fauna were apparent only for the bullhead, Cottus gobio. The activity triggers identified offer a unique insight into the invasion mechanisms of these ecosystem-changing non-native gobiids."

We examined the association between the BMI and the WC and the time to a first symptomatic recurrent VTE using competing risk regression, adjusting for known risk factors of VTE recurrence and periods of anticoagulation.The mean follow-up was 28 months. The 3-year cumulative incidence of recurrent VTE did not vary by BMI and was 17.6% for a BMI <25 kg/m2, 11.5% for a BMI 25 to <30 kg/m2, and 16.9% for a BMI ≥30 kg/m2 (P = 0.09).

https://openalex.org/W2753960091,"Veterinary Herbal Medicine (VHM) is a comprehensive, current, and informative discipline on the utilization of herbs in veterinary practice. Driven by chemistry but progressively directed by pharmacology and the clinical sciences, drug research has contributed more to address the needs for innovative veterinary medicine for curing animal diseases. However, research into veterinary medicine of vegetal origin in the pharmaceutical industry has reduced, owing to questions such as the short of compatibility of traditional natural-product extract libraries with high-throughput screening. Here, we present a cross-species chemogenomic screening platform to dissect the genetic basis of multifactorial diseases and to determine the most suitable points of attack for future veterinary medicines, thereby increasing the number of treatment options. First, based on critically examined pharmacology and text mining, we build a cross-species drug-likeness evaluation approach to screen the lead compounds in veterinary medicines. Second, a specific cross-species target prediction model is developed to infer drug-target connections, with the purpose of understanding how drugs work on the specific targets. Third, we focus on exploring the multiple targets interference effects of veterinary medicines by heterogeneous network convergence and modularization analysis. Finally, we manually integrate a disease pathway to test whether the cross-species chemogenomic platform could uncover the active mechanism of veterinary medicine, which is exemplified by a specific network module. We believe the proposed cross-species chemogenomic platform allows for the systematization of current and traditional knowledge of veterinary medicine and, importantly, for the application of this emerging body of knowledge to the development of new drugs for animal diseases."

Additionally, the mean amplitude of ERPRT correlates with individual performance. We performed a comprehensive analysis of the mirror-normal differences in the early and late phases of mental rotation and deduced that out-of-plane rotation is more likely to occur in the late phase and interacts with both in-plane rotation and the decision-making process, as indicated by both behavioral and electrophysiological findings."
https://openalex.org/W2755414109,"This study aimed to provide a long-term cost comparison of patients using additional homeopathic treatment (homeopathy group) with patients using usual care (control group) over an observation period of 33 months.Health claims data from a large statutory health insurance company were analysed from both the societal perspective (primary outcome) and from the statutory health insurance perspective (secondary outcome). To compare costs between patient groups, homeopathy and control patients were matched in a 1:1 ratio using propensity scores. Predictor variables for the propensity scores included health care costs and both medical and demographic variables. Health care costs were analysed using an analysis of covariance, adjusted for baseline costs, between groups both across diagnoses and for specific diagnoses over a period of 33 months. Specific diagnoses included depression, migraine, allergic rhinitis, asthma, atopic dermatitis, and headache.Data from 21,939 patients in the homeopathy group (67.4% females) and 21,861 patients in the control group (67.2% females) were analysed. Health care costs over the 33 months were 12,414 EUR [95% CI 12,022-12,805] in the homeopathy group and 10,428 EUR [95% CI 10,036-10,820] in the control group (p<0.0001). The largest cost differences were attributed to productivity losses (homeopathy: EUR 6,289 [6,118-6,460]; control: EUR 5,498 [5,326-5,670], p<0.0001) and outpatient costs (homeopathy: EUR 1,794 [1,770-1,818]; control: EUR 1,438 [1,414-1,462], p<0.0001). Although the costs of the two groups converged over time, cost differences remained over the full 33 months. For all diagnoses, homeopathy patients generated higher costs than control patients.The analysis showed that even when following-up over 33 months, there were still cost differences between groups, with higher costs in the homeopathy group."

Despite this importance and the existence of NS5B crystal structures, our understanding of the conformational and dynamic behavior of NS5B in solution and its relationship with NS5A-D2 remains incomplete. To address these points, we report the first detailed NMR spectroscopic study of HCV NS5B lacking its membrane anchor (NS5BΔ21). Analysis of constructs with selective isotope labeling of the δ1 methyl groups of isoleucine side chains demonstrates that, in solution, NS5BΔ21 is highly dynamic but predominantly adopts a closed conformation. The addition of NS5A-D2 leads to spectral changes indicative of binding to both allosteric thumb sites I and II of NS5BΔ21 and induces long-range perturbations that affect the RNA-binding properties of the polymerase. We compared these modifications with the short- and long-range effects triggered in NS5BΔ21 upon binding of filibuvir, an allosteric inhibitor. We demonstrate that filibuvir-bound NS5BΔ21 is strongly impaired in the binding of both NS5A-D2 and RNA. NS5A-D2 induces conformational and functional perturbations in NS5B similar to those triggered by filibuvir. Thus, our work highlights NS5A-D2 as an allosteric regulator of the HCV polymerase and provides new insight into the dynamics of NS5B in solution.

It was identified as the non-A, non-B hepatitis causative agent in the late 1980s and is now estimated to have chronically infected ∼71 million people worldwide (1World Health Organization Hepatitis C: fact sheet. World Health Organization, Geneva2017Google Scholar). HCV infection may be asymptomatic, but 75–85% of individuals with acute hepatitis will develop a chronic infection that can lead to severe liver damage, such as cirrhosis or hepatocellular carcinoma, and finally to death (2Stanaway J.D. Flaxman A.D. Naghavi M. Fitzmaurice C. Vos T. Abubakar I. Abu-Raddad L.J. Assadi R. Bhala N. Cowie B. Forouzanfour M.H. Groeger J. Hanafiah K.M. Jacobsen K.H.

Currently, it is estimated that about 400,000 people worldwide die from hepatitis C each year. Although the incidence of HCV infections is decreasing in developed countries, the number of deaths associated with this liver disease is expected to rise within the next 15 years. Depending on the nucleotide sequence of its RNA genome (∼9,600 nucleotides), HCV is classified into seven genotypes (3Smith D.B. Bukh J. Kuiken C. Muerhoff A.S. Rice C.M. Stapleton J.T. Simmonds P.

Genotypes 1 and 3 are responsible for ∼45 and ∼30% of HCV infections worldwide, respectively. Whereas genotype 1 is the most prevalent in developed countries, genotypes 4 and 5 are essentially present in developing countries (4Messina J.P. Humphreys I. Flaxman A. Brown A. Cooke G.S.

The HCV-positive sense single-stranded RNA genome ((+)ssRNA) contains a unique open reading frame between 5′- and 3′-non-translated regions that are required for translation and replication. The open reading frame encodes a polyprotein precursor, which is subsequently cleaved by host and viral proteases into 10 mature proteins: the structural proteins (core, E1, and E2) that constitute the virus particle and the non-structural (NS) proteins (p7, NS2, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, NS5A, and NS5B) (5Moradpour D.

Hepatitis C virus RNA replication.Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 2013; 369: 167-198PubMed Google Scholar). This complex has been localized in induced ER-derived membrane structures, named the double-membrane vesicles (8Romero-Brey I. Merz A. Chiramel A. Lee J.-Y. Chlanda P. Haselman U.

Tremendous progress has been made in the development of anti-HCV drugs since the introduction, in 2011, of the first two direct-acting antiviral agents (DAA) that target the NS3/4A serine protease (17Schlütter J. Therapeutics: new drugs hit the target.Nature. 2011; 474: S5-S7Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). Nowadays, efficient DAAs that inhibit either NS3/4A, NS5A, or NS5B proteins have been approved for therapeutic use. These all-oral, interferon-free DAAs, mainly used in combination, have enabled the achievement of cure rates of >90% (18Rice C.M. Saeed M.

HCV NS5B constitutes the enzymatic core of the viral replicase complex, as it carries the RdRp activity required for RNA replication. In this process, NS5B catalyzes the polymerization of ribonucleoside tri-phosphates (rNTPs) to synthesize an intermediate (−)ssRNA molecule from its initial template, the (+)ssRNA genome. Then the newly synthesized molecule serves as a template to produce numerous (+)ssRNA molecules that will later be used either for polyprotein translation, production of infectious particles, or synthesis of new intermediates for RNA replication (21Lindenbach B.D. Rice C.M. Unravelling hepatitis C virus replication from genome to function.Nature. 2005; 436: 933-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (644) Google Scholar). NS5B (591 residues, 65 kDa) is anchored to the ER membrane via its 21 C-terminal residues (22Schmidt-Mende J. Bieck E. Hugle T. Penin F. Rice C.M. Blum H.E. Moradpour D.

The crystallographic structure of NS5BΔ21 (i.e. without its C-terminal membrane anchor) revealed that the polymerase resembles a closed right hand with three subdomains termed the palm, fingers, and thumb. NS5B also contains three additional structural features: 1) two loops (Λ1 and Λ2) of the fingers subdomain, which make extensive contacts with the top of the thumb and thus encircle the active site; 2) a β-loop in the thumb subdomain, which protrudes into the active site; and 3) a C-terminal disordered linker that folds back into the active site (25Bressanelli S.

This conformational rearrangement, a rate-limiting event, is believed to take place between the de novo initiation and the processive elongation steps of RNA replication.Figure 3NS5A-D2 interacts with NS5BΔ21. a, superposition of methyl-TROSY spectra of U-15N,2H-,Ile δ1-13C1H3-labeled NS5BΔ21 (40 μm) recorded in the presence of increasing concentrations (0, 20, 40, 80, 200, and 400 μm) of unlabeled NS5A-D2. b, 1H,13C combined CSPs observed in the NS5B–NS5A-D2 (1:2 molar ratio in a) spectrum mapped, from yellow (0 ppm) to red (0.018 ppm), onto the Ile δ1 methyl groups of the NS5B structure (PDB code 2XXD).

https://openalex.org/W2755495589,"Background and objective Skeletal muscle has been suggested as an important factor in the pathophysiology of metabolic syndrome. During the aging process, muscle mass is lost in specific body parts. However, few studies have investigated the relationship between site-specific muscle loss assessed using computed tomography (CT) and metabolic syndrome. This study was conducted to investigate the association between metabolic syndrome and rectus abdominis muscle thickness at the umbilicus level (RAM), which reflects site-specific muscle loss of the abdomen using CT image. Methods This cross-sectional study was conducted on 725 middle-aged Korean men. Anthropometric evaluation and biochemical tests were performed. The RAMs of the subjects were measured from CT images taken at the umbilicus level. Results The mean RAM (mean ±SD) of subjects with metabolic syndrome was 2.46 ±0.01, which was thinner than that of subjects without metabolic syndrome (2.52 ±0.01, p<0.01). Moreover, RAM decreased as the number of metabolic syndrome components increased (p-value for trend<0.01). RAM was positively correlated with body mass index (r = 0.21, p<0.01), skeletal muscle index (r = 0.26, p<0.01), and creatinine (r = 0.12, p<0.01), while RAM was negatively correlated with age(r = -0.11, p<0.01), abdominal circumference(r = -0.22, p<0.01), fasting glucose (r = -0.10, p<0.01), and triglycerides(r = -0.15, p<0.01). Using a stepwise multiple logistic regression analysis, we found that RAM was an independent factor associated with metabolic syndrome (OR: 0.861, 95%CI, 0.779–0.951, p<0.01). The result was not different in the statistical analysis including the components of MS (OR: 0.860, 95% CI, 0.767–0.965, p = 0.01). Conclusion RAM was associated with metabolic syndrome in middle-aged men. Moreover, site-specific muscle loss at the abdomen, as evaluated by RAM, also may be a predictor of metabolic syndrome like SMI."
https://openalex.org/W2755643212,"Network oscillations of different frequencies, durations and amplitudes are hypothesized to coordinate information processing and transfer across brain areas. Among these oscillations, hippocampal sharp wave-ripple complexes (SPW-Rs) are one of the most prominent. SPW-Rs occurring in the hippocampus are suggested to play essential roles in memory consolidation as well as information transfer to the neocortex. To-date, most of the knowledge about SPW-Rs comes from experimental studies averaging responses from neuronal populations monitored by conventional microelectrodes. In this work, we investigate spatiotemporal characteristics of SPW-Rs and how microelectrode size and distance influence SPW-R recordings using a biophysical model of hippocampus. We also explore contributions from neuronal spikes and synaptic potentials to SPW-Rs based on two different types of network activity. Our study suggests that neuronal spikes from pyramidal cells contribute significantly to ripples while high amplitude sharp waves mainly arise from synaptic activity. Our simulations on spatial reach of SPW-Rs show that the amplitudes of sharp waves and ripples exhibit a steep decrease with distance from the network and this effect is more prominent for smaller area electrodes. Furthermore, the amplitude of the signal decreases strongly with increasing electrode surface area as a result of averaging. The relative decrease is more pronounced when the recording electrode is closer to the source of the activity. Through simulations of field potentials across a high-density microelectrode array, we demonstrate the importance of finding the ideal spatial resolution for capturing SPW-Rs with great sensitivity. Our work provides insights on contributions from spikes and synaptic potentials to SPW-Rs and describes the effect of measurement configuration on LFPs to guide experimental studies towards improved SPW-R recordings."
https://openalex.org/W2754018309,"Purified myelin membranes (PMMs) are the starting material for biochemical analyses such as the isolation of detergent-insoluble glycosphingolipid-rich domains (DIGs), which are believed to be representatives of functional lipid rafts. The normal DIGs isolation protocol involves the extraction of lipids under moderate cooling. Here, we thus address the influence of cooling on the structure of PMMs and its sub-fractions. Thermodynamic and structural aspects of periodic, multilamellar PMMs are examined between 4°C and 45°C and in various biologically relevant aqueous solutions. The phase behavior is investigated by small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). Complementary neutron diffraction (ND) experiments with solid-supported myelin multilayers confirm that the phase behavior is unaffected by planar confinement. SAXS and ND consistently show that multilamellar PMMs in pure water become heterogeneous when cooled by more than 10-15°C below physiological temperature, as during the DIGs isolation procedure. The heterogeneous state of PMMs is stabilized in physiological solution, where phase coexistence persists up to near the physiological temperature. This result supports the general view that membranes under physiological conditions are close to critical points for phase separation. In presence of elevated Ca2+ concentrations (> 10 mM), phase coexistence is found even far above physiological temperatures. The relative fractions of the two phases, and thus presumably also their compositions, are found to vary with temperature. Depending on the conditions, an ""expanded"" phase with larger lamellar period or a ""compacted"" phase with smaller lamellar period coexists with the native phase. Both expanded and compacted periods are also observed in DIGs under the respective conditions. The observed subtle temperature-dependence of the phase behavior of PMMs suggests that the composition of DIGs is sensitive to the details of the isolation protocol."
https://openalex.org/W2756080496,"Metacognitive monitoring and control of situation awareness (SA) are important for a range of safety-critical roles (e.g., air traffic control, military command and control). We examined the factors affecting these processes using a visual change detection task that included representative tactical displays. SA was assessed by asking novice observers to detect changes to a tactical display. Metacognitive monitoring was assessed by asking observers to estimate the probability that they would correctly detect a change, either after study of the display and before the change (judgement of learning; JOL) or after the change and detection response (judgement of performance; JOP). In Experiment 1, observers failed to detect some changes to the display, indicating imperfect SA, but JOPs were reasonably well calibrated to objective performance. Experiment 2 examined JOLs and JOPs in two task contexts: with study-time limits imposed by the task or with self-pacing to meet specified performance targets. JOPs were well calibrated in both conditions as were JOLs for high performance targets. In summary, observers had limited SA, but good insight about their performance and learning for high performance targets and allocated study time appropriately."
https://openalex.org/W2755496750,"This study aims to identify any differences regarding gender, age, socioeconomic status (SES), self-rated health, perceived stress and the purchase of prescribed drugs among people who practice mind and body exercises (MBE) extensively compared to people who do not. Methods: The study includes 3,913 men and 4,803 women aged 20–72 who participated in the Swedish Longitudinal Occupational Survey of Health (SLOSH). The respondents were divided into three groups depending on frequency of MBE practice (never/seldom/often). Measures regarding MBE practice, health behaviors, self-rated health, and illnesses were drawn from the SLOSH questionnaire, while more objective measures of socioeconomic status and education were derived from registry data. In addition, data on purchases of prescription drugs for all respondents were included in the study. These data were obtained from the Swedish Prescribed Drug Register, which contains information about prescription drugs dispensed at Swedish pharmacies. Separate analyses were performed for mental MBE (mindfulness, meditation, relaxation techniques) and physical MBE (yoga, Tai Chi, Qi Gong), respectively. Results: A high intensity MBE practice is cross-sectionally related to poor self-assessed health (sleeping problems, pain, depressive symptoms, mental disorders), high levels of stress, and high levels of purchases of psychotropic drugs and analgesics. These cross-sectional relationships are generally stronger for mental MBE than for bodily-directed MBE. More women than men are practicing MBE on a regular basis, and physically active people participate to a greater extent in MBE compared with the physically inactive. Conclusion: Overall, the study shows that frequent participation in mind and body exercises is associated with high levels of purchases of psychotropic drugs and analgesics as well as with poor self-assessed health and high levels of stress. However, since this is a cross-sectional study, it is impossible to establish cause and effect, and to further investigate the associations found; longitudinal studies that can account for temporality between covariates and MBE use are needed."
