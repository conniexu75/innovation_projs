https://openalex.org/W2992232652,"Mitochondrial fission is important in physiological processes, including coordination of mitochondrial and nuclear division during mitosis, and pathologic processes, such as the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) during cardiac ischemia-reperfusion injury (IR). Mitochondrial fission is mainly mediated by dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1), a large GTPase. The GTPase activity of Drp1 is essential for its fissogenic activity. Therefore, we aimed to identify Drp1 inhibitors and evaluate their anti-neoplastic and cardioprotective properties in five cancer cell lines (A549, SK-MES-1, SK-LU-1, SW 900, and MCF7) and an experimental cardiac IR injury model. Virtual screening of a chemical library revealed 17 compounds with high predicted affinity to the GTPase domain of Drp1. In silico screening identified an ellipticine compound, Drpitor1, as a putative, potent Drp1 inhibitor. We also synthesized a congener of Drpitor1 to remove the methoxymethyl group and reduce hydrolytic lability (Drpitor1a). Drpitor1 and Drpitor1a inhibited the GTPase activity of Drp1 without inhibiting the GTPase of dynamin 1. Drpitor1 and Drpitor1a have greater potency than the current standard Drp1 GTPase inhibitor, mdivi-1, (IC50 for mitochondrial fragmentation are 0.09, 0.06, and 10 μM, respectively). Both Drpitors reduced proliferation and induced apoptosis in cancer cells. Drpitor1a suppressed lung cancer tumor growth in a mouse xenograft model. Drpitor1a also inhibited mitochondrial ROS production, prevented mitochondrial fission, and improved right ventricular diastolic dysfunction during IR injury. In conclusion, Drpitors are useful tools for understanding mitochondrial dynamics and have therapeutic potential in treating cancer and cardiac IR injury."
https://openalex.org/W2990118269,"Ginsenoside Rg3 is one of the main constituents of Panax ginseng. Compelling evidence has demonstrated that ginsenoside Rg3 is capable of inhibiting inflammation. However, the mechanism mediating its anti-inflammatory effects remain unclear. Here we show that ginsenoside Rg3 blocks IL-1β secretion and caspase-1 activation through inhibiting LPS priming and the NLRP3 inflammasome activation in human and mouse macrophages. Rg3 specifically inhibits activation of NLRP3 but not the NLRC4 or AIM2 inflammasomes. In addition, Rg3 has no effect on upstream regulation of NLRP3 inflammasome, such as K+ efflux, ROS production, or mitochondrial membrane potential. Mechanistically, Rg3 abrogates NEK7-NLRP3 interaction, and subsequently inhibits NLRP3-ASC interaction, ASC oligomerization, and speckle formation. More importantly, Rg3 can reduce IL-1β secretion induced by LPS in mice and protect mice from lethal endotoxic shock. Thus, our findings reveal an anti-inflammatory mechanism for Rg3 and suggest its potential use in NLRP3-driven diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2991270461,"Overloading of tendon tissue with resulting chronic pain (tendinopathy) is a common disorder in occupational-, leisure- and sports-activity, but its pathogenesis remains poorly understood. To investigate the very early phase of tendinopathy, Achilles and patellar tendons were investigated in 200 physically active patients and 50 healthy control persons. Patients were divided into three groups: symptoms for 0-1 months (T1), 1-2 months (T2) or 2-3 months (T3). Tendinopathic Achilles tendon cross-sectional area determined by ultrasonography (US) was ~25% larger than in healthy control persons. Both Achilles and patellar anterior-posterior diameter were elevated in tendinopathy, and only later in Achilles was the width increased. Increased tendon size was accompanied by an increase in hypervascularization (US Doppler flow) without any change in mRNA for angiogenic factors. From patellar biopsies taken bilaterally, mRNA for most growth factors and tendon components remained unchanged (except for TGF-beta1 and substance-P) in early tendinopathy. Tendon stiffness remained unaltered over the first three months of tendinopathy and was similar to the asymptomatic contra-lateral tendon. In conclusion, this suggests that tendinopathy pathogenesis represents a disturbed tissue homeostasis with fluid accumulation. The disturbance is likely induced by repeated mechanical overloading rather than a partial rupture of the tendon."
https://openalex.org/W2990633857,"The inner cell mass (ICM) in blastocyst is the origin of all somatic and germ cells in mammals and pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) in vitro. As the conserved principles between pig and human, here we performed comprehensive single-cell RNA-seq for porcine early embryos from oocyte to early blastocyst (EB). We show the specification of the ICM and trophectoderm in morula and the molecular signature of the precursors. We demonstrate the existence of naïve pluripotency signature in morula and ICM of EB, and the specific pluripotent genes and the activity of signalling pathways highlight the characteristics of the naïve pluripotency. We observe the absence of dosage compensation with respect to X-chromosome (XC) in morula, and incomplete dosage compensation in the EB. However, the dynamics of dosage compensation may be independent of the expression of XIST induced XC inactivation. Our study describes molecular landmarks of embryogenesis in pig that will provide a better strategy for derivation of porcine PSCs and improve research in regenerative medicine."
https://openalex.org/W2993001216,"The NLRP3 inflammasome is formed by the sensor NLRP3, the adaptor ASC, and pro-caspase-1. Assembly and activation of the inflammasome trigger caspase-1-dependent cleavage of pro-IL-1β and pro-IL-18 into their secreted forms. Cigarette smoke is a risk factor for chronic inflammatory diseases and is associated with macrophage dysfunction. The impact of cigarette smoke on NLRP3-dependent responses in macrophages is largely unknown. Herein, we investigated the effects of cigarette smoke extract (CSE) on the NLRP3 inflammasome in human monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) and THP-1 cells stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and LPS plus the NLRP3 inflammasome activator ATP. We found that CSE inhibited the release of IL-1β and IL-18 as well as the expression of NLRP3 acting mainly at the transcriptional level. Interestingly, we found that CSE increased the caspase-1 activity via an NLRP3-independent and TLR4-TRIF-caspase-8-dependent pathway. Activation of caspase-1 by CSE led to a reduction of the basal glycolytic flux and impaired glycolytic burst in response to LPS. Overall, our findings unveil novel pathways leading to immune-metabolic alterations in human macrophages exposed to cigarette smoke. These mechanisms may contribute to macrophage dysfunction and increased risk of infection in smokers."
https://openalex.org/W2996402632,"While great interest in health effects of natural product (NP) including dietary supplements and foods persists, promising preclinical NP research is not consistently translating into actionable clinical trial (CT) outcomes. Generally considered the gold standard for assessing safety and efficacy, CTs, especially phase III CTs, are costly and require rigorous planning to optimize the value of the information obtained. More effective bridging from NP research to CT was the goal of a September, 2018 transdisciplinary workshop. Participants emphasized that replicability and likelihood of successful translation depend on rigor in experimental design, interpretation, and reporting across the continuum of NP research. Discussions spanned good practices for NP characterization and quality control; use and interpretation of models (computational through in vivo) with strong clinical predictive validity; controls for experimental artefacts, especially for in vitro interrogation of bioactivity and mechanisms of action; rigorous assessment and interpretation of prior research; transparency in all reporting; and prioritization of research questions. Natural product clinical trials prioritized based on rigorous, convergent supporting data and current public health needs are most likely to be informative and ultimately affect public health. Thoughtful, coordinated implementation of these practices should enhance the knowledge gained from future NP research."
https://openalex.org/W2992965996,"Despite the importance of the tumor microenvironment in regulating tumor progression, few in vitro models have been developed to understand the effects of non-neoplastic cells and extracellular matrix (ECM) on drug resistance in glioblastoma (GBM) cells. Using CellTrace-labeled human GBM and microglial (MG) cells, we established a 2D co-culture including various ratios of the two cell types. Viability, proliferation, migration, and drug response assays were carried out to assess the role of MG. A 3D model was then established using a hyaluronic acid-gelatin hydrogel to culture a mixture of GBM and MG and evaluate drug resistance. A contact co-culture of fluorescently labeled GBM and MG demonstrated that MG cells modestly promoted tumor cell proliferation (17%-30% increase) and greater migration of GBM cells (>1.5-fold increase). Notably, the presence of MG elicited drug resistance even when in a low ratio (10%-20%) relative to co-cultured tumor cells. The protective effect of MG on GBM was greater in the 3D model (>100% survival of GBM when challenged with cytotoxics). This new 3D human model demonstrated the influence of non-neoplastic cells and matrix on chemoresistance of GBM cells to three agents with different mechanisms of action suggesting that such sophisticated in vitro approaches may facilitate improved preclinical testing."
https://openalex.org/W2986529737,"Angiogenesis is critical for the development, progression, and metastasis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), but the roles of miR-3064-5p in HCC angiogenesis are still unknown. In this study, the roles of miR-3064-5p in HCC angiogenesis were studied in 192 HCC patients, xenograft mouse models, and HCC cell lines. The results showed that miR-3064-5p expression was significantly decreased in HCC tissues and cells, and downregulated miR-3064-5p was associated with upregulated angiogenic potential of HCC. MiR-3064-5p inhibited proangiogenic VEGFA and angiogenin expressions but induced antiangiogenic endostatin and MMP12 expressions, finally leading to suppression of HCC angiogenesis, as shown by the decline in intratumoral microvessel density (MVD). Moreover, miR-3064-5p was inversely correlated with lncRNA MALAT1 and FOXA1. FOXA1 bound to and interacted with CD24 and then regulated Src phosphorylation. MiR-3064-5p played an antiangiogenic role by inhibiting the FOXA1/CD24/Src pathway, whereas oncogenic MALAT1 functioned as a competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) by sponging miR-3064-5p to alleviate the suppressive effect on the FOXA1 pathway. HCC patients with high miR-3064-5p, low MALAT1, or low FOXA1 expression had a better prognosis with longer overall survival and recurrence-free survival. In univariate and multivariate analyses, miR-3064-5p was identified as the independent prognostic predicator for HCC progression and patient survival. Taken together, miR-3064-5p exerts an antiangiogenic role by targeting the FOXA1/CD24/Src pathway but oncogenic lncRNA MALAT1 acts as a ceRNA to sponge miR-3064-5p. MiR-3064-5p is of great clinical significance and is a novel prognostic indicator and an attractive therapeutic target for HCC."
https://openalex.org/W2989610354,"Structural conversion of cellular prion protein (PrPC) into scrapie PrP (PrPSc) and subsequent aggregation are key events associated with the onset of transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs). Experimental evidence supports the role of nucleic acids (NAs) in assisting this conversion. Here, we asked whether PrP undergoes liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) and if this process is modulated by NAs. To this end, two 25-mer DNA aptamers, A1 and A2, were selected against the globular domain of recombinant murine PrP (rPrP90-231) using SELEX methodology. Multiparametric structural analysis of these aptamers revealed that A1 adopts a hairpin conformation. Aptamer binding caused partial unfolding of rPrP90-231 and modulated its ability to undergo LLPS and fibrillate. In fact, although free rPrP90-231 phase separated into large droplets, aptamer binding increased the number of droplets but noticeably reduced their size. Strikingly, a modified A1 aptamer that does not adopt a hairpin structure induced formation of amyloid fibrils on the surface of the droplets. We show here that PrP undergoes LLPS, and that the PrP interaction with NAs modulates phase separation and promotes PrP fibrillation in a NA structure and concentration-dependent manner. These results shed new light on the roles of NAs in PrP misfolding and TSEs."
https://openalex.org/W2990783820,"Unique features of sensory neuron subtypes are manifest by their distinct physiological and pathophysiological functions. Using patch-clamp electrophysiology, Ca2+ imaging, calcitonin gene-related peptide release assay from tissues, protein biochemistry approaches, and behavioral physiology on pain models, this study demonstrates the diversity of sensory neuron pathophysiology is due in part to subtype-dependent sensitization of TRPV1 and TRPA1. Differential sensitization is influenced by distinct expression of inflammatory mediators, such as prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), bradykinin (BK), and nerve growth factor (NGF) as well as multiple kinases, including protein kinase A (PKA) and C (PKC). However, the co-expression and interaction of TRPA1 with TRPV1 proved to be the most critical for differential sensitization of sensory neurons. We identified N- and C-terminal domains on TRPV1 responsible for TRPA1-TRPV1 (A1-V1) complex formation. Ablation of A1-V1 complex with dominant-negative peptides against these domains substantially reduced the sensitization of TRPA1, as well as BK- and CFA-induced hypersensitivity. These data indicate that often occurring TRP channel complexes regulate diversity in neuronal sensitization and may provide a therapeutic target for many neuroinflammatory pain conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2991765530,"Endurance exercise begun with reduced muscle glycogen stores seems to potentiate skeletal muscle protein abundance and gene expression. However, it is unknown whether this greater signaling responses is due to performing two exercise sessions in close proximity—as a first exercise session is necessary to reduce the muscle glycogen stores. In the present study, we manipulated the recovery duration between a first muscle glycogen-depleting exercise and a second exercise session, such that the second exercise session started with reduced muscle glycogen in both approaches but was performed either 2 or 15 hours after the first exercise session (so-called “twice-a-day” and “once-daily” approaches, respectively). We found that exercise twice-a-day increased the nuclear abundance of transcription factor EB (TFEB) and nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) and potentiated the transcription of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-ɣ coactivator 1-alpha (PGC-1α), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha (PPARα), and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor beta/delta (PPARβ/δ) genes, in comparison with the once-daily exercise. These results suggest that part of the elevated molecular signaling reported with previous “train-low” approaches might be attributed to performing two exercise sessions in close proximity. The twice-a-day approach might be an effective strategy to induce adaptations related to mitochondrial biogenesis and fat oxidation."
https://openalex.org/W2991948412,"The NLRP3 inflammasome regulates innate immune and inflammatory responses by promoting caspase1-dependent induction of pro-inflammatory cytokines. However, aberrant inflammasome activation causes diverse diseases, and thus inflammasome activity must be tightly controlled. Here, we reveal a molecular mechanism underlying the regulation of NLRP3 inflammasome. NLRP3 interacts with SUMO-conjugating enzyme (UBC9), which subsequently promotes small ubiquitin-like modifier 1 (SUMO1) to catalyze NLRP3 SUMOylation at residue Lys204. SUMO1-catalyzed SUMOylation of NLRP3 facilitates ASC oligomerization, inflammasome activation, and interleukin-1β secretion. Moreover, this study also reveals that SUMO-specific protease 3 (SENP3) is required for the deSUMOylation of NLRP3. Interestingly, SENP3 deSUMOylates NLRP3 to attenuate ASC recruitment and speck formation, the NLRP3 inflammasome activation, as well as IL-1β cleavage and secretion. In conclusion, we reveal that SUMO1-catalyzed SUMOylation and SENP3-mediated deSUMOylation of NLRP3 orchestrate the inflammasome activation."
https://openalex.org/W2991181561,"Kidney fibrosis is a common process of various kidney diseases leading to end-stage renal failure irrespective of etiology. Myofibroblasts are crucial mediators in kidney fibrosis through production of extracellular matrix (ECM), but their origin has not been clearly identified. Many study proposed that epithelial and endothelial cells become myofibroblasts by epithelial dedifferentiation and endothelial-mesenchymal transition (EndoMT). TGF-β1/Smad signaling plays a crucial role in partly epithelial-mensencymal transition (EMT) and EndoMT. Thus, we designed the TGF-β1/Smad oligodeoxynucleotide (ODN), a synthetic short DNA containing complementary sequence for Smad transcription factor and TGF-β1 mRNA. Therefore, this study investigated the anti-fibrotic effect of synthetic TGF-β1/Smad ODN on UUO-induced kidney fibrosis in vivo model and TGF-β1-induced in vitro model. To examine the effect of TGF-β1/Smad ODN, we performed various experiments to evaluate kidney fibrosis. The results showed that UUO induced inflammation, ECM accumulation, epithelial dedifferentiation and EndoMT processes, and tubular atrophy. However, synthetic TGF-β1/Smad ODN significantly suppressed UUO-induced fibrosis. Furthermore, synthetic ODN attenuated TGF-β1-induced epithelial dedifferentiation and EndoMT program via blocking TGF-β1/Smad signaling. In conclusion, this study demonstrated that administration of synthetic TGF-β1/Smad ODN attenuates kidney fibrosis, epithelial dedifferentiation, and EndoMT processes. The findings propose the possibility of synthetic ODN as a new effective therapeutic tool for kidney fibrosis."
https://openalex.org/W2994156504,"Studies on the effects of transcriptional memory on clone reprogramming in mammals are limited. In the present study, we observed higher levels of active histone H3 lysine 4 trimethylation (H3K4me3 and 5-hydroxymethylcytosine) and repressive (5-methylcytosine) epigenetic modifications in bovine early cloned embryos than in in vitro fertilized embryos. We hypothesized that aberrant epigenetic modification may result in transcriptional disorders in bovine somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) embryos. RNA sequencing results confirmed that both abnormal transcriptional silencing and transcriptional activation are involved in bovine SCNT reprogramming. The cloned embryos exhibited excessive transcription in RNA processing- and translation-related genes as well as transcriptional defects in reproduction-related genes whose transcriptional profiles were similar to those in donor cells. These results demonstrated the existence of active and silent memory genes inherited from donor cells in early bovine SCNT embryos. Further, H3K4me3-specific demethylase 5B (KDM5B) mRNA was injected into the reconstructed embryos to reduce the increased H3K4me3 modification. KDM5B overexpression not only reduced the transcriptional level of active memory genes, but also promoted the expression of silent memory genes; in particular, it rescued the expression of multiple development-related genes. These results showed that transcriptional memory acts as a reprogramming barrier and KDM5B improves SCNT reprogramming via bidirectional regulation effects on transcriptional memory genes in bovines."
https://openalex.org/W2990328634,"The peptide kisspeptin and its receptor, Kiss1r, act centrally to stimulate reproduction. Evidence indicates that kisspeptin signaling is also important for body weight (BW) and metabolism. We recently reported that Kiss1r KO mice develop obesity, along with reduced metabolism and energy expenditure, independent of estradiol levels. Outside the brain, Kiss1r is expressed in several metabolic tissues, including brown adipose tissue (BAT), but it is unknown which specific tissue is responsible for the metabolic phenotype in Kiss1r KOs. We first determined that global Kiss1r KO mice have significant alterations in body temperature and BAT thermogenic gene expression, perhaps contributing to their obesity. Next, to test whether kisspeptin signaling specifically in BAT influences BW, metabolism, or body temperature, we used Cre/lox technology to generate conditional Kiss1r knockout exclusively in BAT (BAT-Kiss1r KO). Unlike global Kiss1r KOs, BAT-Kiss1r KOs (lacking Kiss1r in just BAT) were not hypogonadal, as expected. Surprisingly, however, BAT-Kiss1r KOs of both sexes displayed significantly lower BW and adiposity than controls. This novel BAT-Kiss1r KO phenotype was of greater magnitude in females and was associated with improved glucose tolerance, increased metabolism, energy expenditure, and locomotor activity, along with increased body temperature and BAT gene expression, specifically Cox8b. Our findings suggest that the previously observed obesity and decreased metabolism in global Kiss1r KOs reflect impaired kisspeptin signaling in non-BAT tissues. However, the novel finding of increased metabolism and body temperature and lower BW in BAT-Kiss1r KOs reveal a previously unidentified role for endogenous kisspeptin signaling in BAT in modulating metabolic and thermogenic physiology."
https://openalex.org/W2990063756,"The newly recognized sensory role of bladder urothelium has generated intense interest in identifying its novel sensory molecules. Sensory receptor TRPV4 may serve such function. However, specific and physiologically relevant tissue actions of TRPV4, stretch-independent responses, and underlying mechanisms are unknown and its role in human conditions has not been examined. Here we showed TRPV4 expression in guinea-pig urothelium, suburothelium, and bladder smooth muscle, with urothelial predominance. Selective TRPV4 activation without stretch evoked significant ATP release—key urothelial sensory process, from live mucosa tissue, full-thickness bladder but not smooth muscle, and sustained muscle contractions. ATP release was mediated by Ca2+-dependent, pannexin/connexin-conductive pathway involving protein tyrosine kinase, but independent from vesicular transport and chloride channels. TRPV4 activation generated greater Ca2+ rise than purinergic activation in urothelial cells. There was intrinsic TRPV4 activity without exogeneous stimulus, causing ATP release. TRPV4 contributed to 50% stretch-induced ATP release. TRPV4 activation also triggered superoxide release. TRPV4 expression was increased with aging. Human bladder mucosa presented similarities to guinea pigs. Overactive bladders exhibited greater TRPV4-induced ATP release with age dependence. These data provide the first evidence in humans for the key functional role of TRPV4 in urothelium with specific mechanisms and identify TRPV4 up-regulation in aging and overactive bladders."
https://openalex.org/W2992120684,"Cell morphology and tissue integrity are essential for embryogenesis. Caveolins are membrane proteins that induce the formation of surface pits called caveolae that serve as membrane reservoirs for cell and tissue protection during development. In vertebrates, caveolin 1 (Cav1) and caveolin 3 (Cav3) are required for caveola formation. However, the formation of caveola and the function of caveolins in invertebrates are largely unknown. In this study, three caveolins, Cav-a, Cav-b, and CavY, are identified in the genome of the invertebrate chordate Ciona spp. Based on phylogenetic analysis, Cav-a is found to be closely related to the vertebrate Cav1 and Cav3. In situ hybridization shows that Cav-a is expressed in Ciona embryonic notochord and muscle. Cell-free experiments, model cell culture systems, and in vivo experiments demonstrate that Ciona Cav-a has the ability to induce membrane curvature at the plasma membrane. Knockdown of Cav-a in Ciona embryos causes loss of invaginations in the plasma membrane and results in the failure of notochord elongation and lumenogenesis. Expression of a dominant-negative Cav-a point mutation causes cells to change shape and become displaced from the muscle and notochord to disrupt tissue integrity. Furthermore, we demonstrate that Cav-a vesicles show polarized trafficking and localize at the luminal membrane during notochord lumenogenesis. Taken together, these results show that the invertebrate chordate caveolin from Ciona plays crucial roles in tissue integrity and morphology by inducing membrane curvature and intracellular vesicle trafficking during embryogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2993868887,"Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) are characterized by an inflammatory and oxidative stress condition in the intestinal tissue. In this study, we evaluated the effect of plumericin, one of the main bioactive components of Himatanthus sucuuba (Woodson) bark, on intestinal inflammation and oxidative stress, both in vitro and in vivo. The effect of plumericin (0.5-2 µM) in vitro was evaluated in rat intestinal epithelial cells (IEC-6) treated with lipopolysaccharides from E. coli (10 μg/mL) plus interferon-γ (10 U/mL). Moreover, a 2,4,6-dinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (DNBS)-induced colitis model was used to evaluate the anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activity of plumericin (3 mg/kg) in vivo. The results showed that plumericin significantly reduces intestinal inflammatory factors such as tumor necrosis factor-α, cyclooxygenase-2 and inducible nitric oxide synthase expression, and nitrotyrosine formation. Plumericin also inhibited nuclear factor-κB translocation, reactive oxygen species (ROS) release, and inflammasome activation. Moreover, plumericin activated the nuclear factor erythroid-derived 2 pathway in IEC-6. Using the DNBS-induced colitis model, a significant reduction in the weight loss and in the development of the macroscopic and histologic signs of colon injury, together with a reduced inflammatory and oxidative stress state, were observed in plumericin-treated mice. These results indicate that plumericin exerts a strong anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activity. Thus, it might be a candidate for the development of a new pharmacologic approach for IBDs treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2990729713,"Intracellular mRNA levels are not always proportional to their respective protein levels, especially in the placenta. This discrepancy may be attributed to various factors including post-transcriptional regulation, such as mRNA methylation (N6-methyladenosine: m6A). Here, we conducted a comprehensive m6A analysis of human placental tissue from neonates with various birth weights to clarify the involvement of m6A in placental biology. The augmented m6A levels at the 5′-untranslated region (UTR) in mRNAs of small-for-date placenta samples were dominant compared to reduction of m6A levels, whereas a decrease in m6A in the vicinity of stop codons was common in heavy-for-date placenta samples. Notably, most of these genes showed similar expression levels between the different birth weight categories. In particular, preeclampsia placenta samples showed consistently upregulated SMPD1 protein levels and increased m6A at 5′-UTR but did not show increased mRNA levels. Mutagenesis of adenosines at 5′-UTR of SMPD1 mRNAs actually decreased protein levels in luciferase assay. Collectively, our findings suggest that m6A both at the 5′-UTR and in the vicinity of stop codon in placental mRNA may play important roles in fetal growth and disease."
https://openalex.org/W2989563048,"d-Amino acids are the ""wrong"" enantiomers of amino acids as they are not used in proteins synthesis but evolved in selected functions. On this side, d-aspartate (d-Asp) plays several significant roles in mammals, especially as an agonist of N-methyl-d-aspartate receptors (NMDAR), and is involved in relevant diseases, such as schizophrenia and Alzheimer's disease. In vivo modulation of d-Asp levels represents an intriguing task to cope with such pathological states. As little is known about d-Asp synthesis, the only option for modulating the levels is via degradation, which is due to the flavoenzyme d-aspartate oxidase (DASPO). Here we present the first three-dimensional structure of a DASPO enzyme (from human) which belongs to the d-amino acid oxidase family. Notably, human DASPO differs from human d-amino acid oxidase (attributed to d-serine degradation, the main coagonist of NMDAR) showing peculiar structural features (a specific active site charge distribution), oligomeric state and kinetic mechanism, and a higher FAD affinity and activity. These results provide useful insights into the structure-function relationships of human DASPO: modulating its activity represents now a feasible novel therapeutic target."
https://openalex.org/W2990032849,"Mutations in peripherin 2 (PRPH2) have been associated with retinitis pigmentosa (RP) and macular/pattern dystrophies, but the origin of this phenotypic variability is unclear. The majority of Prph2 mutations are located in the large intradiscal loop (D2), a region that contains seven cysteines involved in intra- and intermolecular disulfide bonding and protein folding. A mutation at cysteine 213, which is engaged in an intramolecular disulfide bond, leads to butterfly-shaped pattern dystrophy in humans, in sharp contrast to mutations in the adjacent cysteine at position 214 which result in RP. To help understand this unexpected phenotypic variability, we generated a knockin mouse line carrying the C213Y disease mutation. The mutant Prph2 protein lost the ability to oligomerize with rod outer segment membrane protein 1 (Rom1), but retained the ability to form homotetramers. C213Y heterozygotes had significantly decreased overall Prph2 levels as well as decreased rod and cone function. Critically, supplementation with extra wild-type Prph2 protein elicited improvements in Prph2 protein levels and rod outer segment structure, but not functional rescue in rods or cones. These findings suggest that not all interruptions of D2 loop intramolecular disulfide bonding lead to haploinsufficiency-related RP, but rather that more subtle changes can lead to mutant proteins stable enough to exert gain-of-function defects in rods and cones. This outcome highlights the difficulty in targeting Prph2-associated gain-of-function disease and suggests that elimination of the mutant protein will be a pre-requisite for any curative therapeutic strategy."
https://openalex.org/W2994142215,"Atherosclerosis is a chronic disease characterized by lipid deposition and inflammatory response. NOD-, LRR- and pyrin domain-containing protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome-facilitated inflammatory responses are crucial in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis, and thus new therapeutic approaches are emerging that target NLRP3 and inflammation. Here, we explored the anti-atherosclerotic effect and mechanisms of a new rutaecarpine derivative, 5-deoxy-rutaecarpine (R3) in vitro and in vivo. R3 treatment attenuated atherosclerosis development and increased plaque stability in Apoe-/- mice fed a high-fat diet, and decreased levels of inflammatory mediators, such as interleukin-1β, in the serum of Apoe-/- mice and in oxidized low-density lipoprotein (ox-LDL)-stimulated murine macrophages. R3 treatment inhibited NLRP3 inflammasome activation in the livers of Apoe-/- mice and ox-LDL-stimulated murine macrophages by inhibiting NF-κB and MAPK pathways. Additionally, R3 significantly decreased total cholesterol in the serum and livers of Apoe-/- mice and promoted cholesterol efflux in murine macrophages through upregulating protein expression of ATP-binding cassette subfamily A member 1 and scavenger receptor class B type I/human CD36 and lysosomal integral membrane protein-II analogous-1. Our results demonstrated that R3 prevented atherosclerotic progression via attenuating NLRP3 inflammasome-related inflammation and modulating cholesterol transport."
https://openalex.org/W2990355337,"Dysregulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis occurs early in Alzheimer's disease (AD), associated with elevated circulating glucocorticoids (GC) and glucocorticoid receptors (GR) signaling impairment. However, the precise role of GR in the pathophysiology of AD remains unclear. Using an acute model of AD induced by the intracerebroventricular injection of amyloid-β oligomers (oAβ), we analyzed cellular and behavioral hallmarks of AD, GR signaling pathways, processing of amyloid precursor protein, and enzymes involved in Tau phosphorylation. We focused on the prefrontal cortex (PFC), particularly rich in GR, early altered in AD and involved in HPA axis control and cognitive functions. We found that oAβ impaired cognitive and emotional behaviors, increased plasma GC levels, synaptic deficits, apoptosis and neuroinflammatory processes. Moreover, oAβ potentiated the amyloidogenic pathway and enzymes involved both in Tau hyperphosphorylation and GR activation. Treatment with a selective GR modulator (sGRm) normalized plasma GC levels and all behavioral and biochemical parameters analyzed. GR seems to occupy a central position in the pathophysiology of AD. Deregulation of the HPA axis and a feed-forward effect on PFC GR sensitivity could participate in the etiology of AD, in perturbing Aβ and Tau homeostasis. These results also reinforce the therapeutic potential of sGRm in AD."
https://openalex.org/W2995583457,"Acute environmental hypoxia may potentiate muscle hypertrophy in response to resistance training but the mechanisms are still unknown. To this end, twenty subjects performed a 1-leg knee extension session (8 sets of 8 repetitions at 80% 1 repetition maximum, 2-min rest between sets) in normoxic or normobaric hypoxic conditions (FiO2 14%). Muscle biopsies were taken 15 min and 4 hours after exercise in the vastus lateralis of the exercised and the non-exercised legs. Blood samples were taken immediately, 2h and 4h after exercise. In vivo, hypoxic exercise fostered acute inflammation mediated by the TNFα/NF-κB/IL-6/STAT3 (+333%, +194%, + 163% and +50% respectively) pathway, which has been shown to contribute to satellite cells myogenesis. Inflammation activation was followed by skeletal muscle invasion by CD68 (+63%) and CD197 (+152%) positive immune cells, both known to regulate muscle regeneration. The role of hypoxia-induced activation of inflammation in myogenesis was confirmed in vitro. Acute hypoxia promoted myogenesis through increased Myf5 (+300%), MyoD (+88%), myogenin (+1816%) and MRF4 (+489%) mRNA levels in primary myotubes and this response was blunted by siRNA targeting STAT3. In conclusion, our results suggest that hypoxia could improve muscle hypertrophic response following resistance exercise through IL-6/STAT3-dependent myogenesis and immune cells-dependent muscle regeneration."
https://openalex.org/W2989714274,"Molecular decision-makers of photoreceptor (PRC) membrane organization and gene regulation are critical to understanding sight and retinal degenerations that lead to blindness. Using Mfrprd6 mice, which develop PRC degeneration, we uncovered that membrane-type frizzled-related protein (MFRP) participates in docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, 22:6) enrichment in a manner similar to adiponectin receptor 1 (AdipoR1). Untargeted imaging mass spectrometry demonstrates cell-specific reduction of phospholipids containing 22:6 and very long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (VLC-PUFAs) in Adipor1−/− and Mfrprd6 retinas. Gene expression of pro-inflammatory signaling pathways is increased and gene-encoding proteins for PRC function decrease in both mutants. Thus, we propose that both proteins are necessary for retinal lipidome membrane organization, visual function, and to the understanding of the early pathology of retinal degenerative diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2993271051,"Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is a common pregnancy complication, particularly prevalent in obese women. Importantly, exercise has beneficial impacts on maternal glucose control and may prevent GDM in ""at-risk"" women. We aimed to determine whether a high-fat diet (HFD) exacerbates metabolic dysfunction and alters gut microbiome in GDM and whether endurance exercise prevents these changes. Uteroplacental insufficiency was induced by bilateral uterine vessel ligation (Restricted) or sham (Control) surgery on E18 in Wistar-Kyoto rats. Female offspring were fed a Chow or HFD (23% fat) from weaning (5 weeks) and at 16 weeks randomly allocated to remain Sedentary or to an exercise protocol of either Exercise prior to and during pregnancy (Exercise); or Exercise during pregnancy only (PregEx). Females were mated (20 weeks) and underwent indirect calorimetry (embryonic day 16; E16), glucose tolerance testing (E18), followed by 24-hr feces collection at E19 (n = 8-10/group). HFD consumption in female rats with GDM exacerbated the adverse metabolic adaptations to pregnancy and altered gut microbial populations. Specifically, the Firmicutes-to-Bacteroidetes ratio was increased, due to an underlying change in abundance of the orders Clostridiales and Bacteroidales. Maternal Exercise, but not PregEx, prevented the development of metabolic dysfunction, increased pancreatic β-cell mass, and prevented the alteration of the gut microbiome in GDM females. Our findings suggest that maternal exercise and diet influence metabolic and microbiome dysfunction in females with GDM, which may impact long-term maternal and offspring health."
https://openalex.org/W2991520189,"The dynamics of cytoplasmic free Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) in pancreatic β cells is central to our understanding of β-cell physiology and pathology. In this context, there are numerous in vitro studies available but existing in vivo data are scarce. We now critically evaluate the anterior chamber of the eye as an in vivo, non-invasive, imaging site for measuring [Ca2+]i dynamics longitudinally in three dimensions and at single-cell resolution. By applying a fluorescently labeled glucose analogue 2-(N-(7-Nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-4-yl)Amino)-2-Deoxyglucose in vivo, we followed how glucose almost simultaneously distributes to all cells within the islet volume, resulting in [Ca2+]i changes. We found that almost all β cells in healthy mice responded to a glucose challenge, while in hyperinsulinemic, hyperglycemic mice about 80% of the β cells could not be further stimulated from fasting basal conditions. This finding indicates that our imaging modality can resolve functional heterogeneity within the β-cell population in terms of glucose responsiveness. Importantly, we demonstrate that glucose homeostasis is markedly affected using isoflurane compared to hypnorm/midazolam anesthetics, which has major implications for [Ca2+]i measurements. In summary, this setup offers a powerful tool to further investigate in vivo pancreatic β-cell [Ca2+]i response patterns at single-cell resolution in health and disease."
https://openalex.org/W2990187154,"Usher syndrome (USH) is the most frequent form of combined hereditary deafness-blindness, characterized by hearing loss and retinitis pigmentosa, with or without vestibular dysfunction. PDZD7 is a PDZ domain-containing scaffold protein that was suggested to be a USH modifier and a contributor to digenic USH. In the inner ear hair cells, PDZD7 localizes at the ankle region of the stereocilia and constitutes the so-called ankle-link complex together with three other USH proteins Usherin, WHRN, and ADGRV1. PDZD7 gene is subjected to alternative splicing, which gives rise to two types of PDZD7 isoforms, namely the long and short isoforms. At present, little is known which specific isoform is involved in ankle-link formation and stereocilia development. In this work, we showed that PDZD7 long isoform, but not short isoforms, localizes at the ankle region of the stereocilia. Moreover, we established Pdzd7 mutant mice by introducing deletions into exon 14 of the Pdzd7 gene, which causes potential premature translational stop in the long isoform but leaves short isoforms unaffected. We found that lack of PDZD7 long isoform affects the localization of other ankle-link complex components in the stereocilia. Consequently, Pdzd7 mutant mice showed stereocilia development deficits and hearing loss as well as reduced mechanotransduction (MET) currents, suggesting that PDZD7 long isoform is indispensable for hair cells. Furthermore, by performing yeast two-hybrid screening, we identified a PDZD7 long isoform-specific binding partner PIP5K1C, which has been shown to play important roles in hearing and might participate in the function and/or transportation of PDZD7."
https://openalex.org/W2991359182,"Mutations in succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) lead to the development of tumors in a restricted subset of cell types, including chromaffin cells and paraganglia. The molecular basis for this specificity is currently unknown. We show that loss of SDH activity in a chromaffin cell model does not perturb complex I function, retaining the ability to oxidize NADH within the electron transport chain. This activity supports continued oxidation of substrates within the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. However, due to the block in the TCA cycle at SDH, the high glutamine oxidation activity is only maintained through an efflux of succinate. We also show that although the mitochondria of SDH-deficient cells are less active per se, their higher mass per cell results in an overall respiratory rate that is comparable with wild-type cells. Finally, we observed that when their mitochondria are uncoupled, SDH-deficient cells are unable to preserve their viability, suggesting that the mitochondrial metabolic network is unable to compensate when exposed to additional stress. We therefore show that in contrast to models of SDH deficiency based on epithelial cells, a chromaffin cell model retains aspects of metabolic “health,” which could form the basis of cell specificity of this rare tumor type."
https://openalex.org/W2991989290,"Interleukin-18 (IL-18) has been demonstrated to augment the antitumor capacity of chimeric antigen receptor-T cells (CAR-T) but the underlying mechanisms are largely unknown. Here we explored the effects and mechanisms of exogenous IL-18 on the antitumor response of CAR-T cells. IL-18 boosted the cytotoxicity of human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2)-specific CAR-T cells ex vivo and enhanced the antitumor efficacy of the CAR-T cells in immunodeficient mice, moreover, IL-18 improved the antitumor capacity of OVA-specific T cells in immunocompetent mice, indicating the universal enhancing function of IL-18 for adoptive cell therapy. To address the roles of IL-18 receptor (IL-18R) in the enhancing function, we evaluated the effects of IL-18R knockout (IL-18R-/-) condition in immunocompetent host and CAR-T cells on the IL-18-enhanced antitumor activities. Interestingly, IL-18 persisted to improve the antitumor ability of IL-18R intact CAR-T cells in IL-18R-/- mice. For IL-18R-/- CAR-T cells, however, IL-18 still holds the enhancing ability to boost the antitumor efficacy in IL-18R-/- mice, albeit the ex vivo tumor-killing ability was lower than that of IL-18R intact CAR-T cells, indicating that IL-18R-independent pathway is involved in the enhancement. Furthermore, tagged IL-18 binded to the membrane of IL-18R-/- splenic and lymph node cells and IL-18R intact and IL-18R-/- CAR-T cells showed distinct transcriptomic profiles when stimulated by IL-18. These data demonstrate that IL-18R-independent pathways contribute to functions of IL-18."
https://openalex.org/W2990719745,"Factor VII activating protease (FSAP) is a circulating serine protease implicated in thrombosis, atherosclerosis, stroke, and cancer. Using an overexpression strategy, we have systematically investigated the role of protease activated receptors (PAR)-1, -2, -3, and -4 on FSAP-mediated signaling in HEK293T and A549 cells. Cleavage of PAR-reporter constructs and MAPK phosphorylation was used to monitor receptor activation. FSAP cleaved PAR-2 and to a lesser degree PAR-1, but not PAR-3 or PAR-4 in both cell types. Robust MAPK activation in response to FSAP was observed after PAR-2, but not PAR-1 overexpression in HEK293T. Recombinant serine protease domain of wild type FSAP, but not the Marburg I isoform of FSAP, could reproduce the effects of plasma purified FSAP. Canonical cleavage of both PARs was suggested by mass spectrometric analysis of synthetic peptide substrates from the N-terminus of PARs and site directed mutagenesis studies. Surprisingly, knockdown of endogenous PAR-1, but not PAR-2, prevented the apoptosis-inhibitory effect of FSAP, suggesting that PAR1 is nevertheless a direct or indirect target in some cell types. This molecular characterization of PAR-1 and -2 as cellular receptors of FSAP will help to define the actions of FSAP in the context of cancer and vascular biology."
https://openalex.org/W2990325347,"BHLHE40, a member of the basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor family, has been reported to play an important role in inflammatory diseases. However, the regulation and function of BHLHE40 in Helicobacter pylori (H pylori)-associated gastritis is unknown. We observed that gastric BHLHE40 was significantly elevated in patients and mice with H pylori infection. Then, we demonstrate that H pylori-infected GECs express BHLHE40 via cagA-ERK pathway. BHLHE40 translocates to cell nucleus, and then binds to cagA protein-activated p-STAT3 (Tyr705). The complex increases chemotactic factor CXCL12 expression (production). Release of CXCL12 from GECs fosters CD4+ T cell infiltration in the gastric mucosa. Our results identify the cagA-BHLHE40-CXCL12 axis that contributes to inflammatory response in gastric mucosa during H pylori infection."
https://openalex.org/W2990260376,"Sleep is an evolutionarily conserved physiological process implicated in the consolidation of learning and memory (L/M). Here, we report that sleep deprivation (SD)-induced cognitive deficits in zebrafish are mediated through reduction in O-GlcNAcylation of brain. Microarray-based gene expression profiling of zebrafish brain demonstrated significant changes in genes involved in metabolism by SD or fear conditioning (FC), compared to the control group. In particular, it was observed that a marked decrease in the number of genes involved in carboxylic acid and organic acid metabolic processes in the brains of SD group compared to control group. SD downregulated O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT) and O-GlcNAcylation, while the expression of O-GlcNAcase was upregulated. FC activated protein kinase A (PKA) and phosphorylated cAMP response element binding protein (p-CREB), an effect that was greatly inhibited by SD. Moreover, FC upregulated expressions of OGT and increased O-GlcNAcylation in the brains of normal but not SD zebrafish. Intriguingly, upregulation of O-GlcNAcylation by glucosamine restored defects in L/M functions and PKA/p-CREB activity in SD group. Our findings highlight the O-GlcNAcylation changes in the brain during the L/M process and further provide a foundation for future studies seeking the molecular and biochemical mechanisms by which HBP of glucose metabolism affects cognitive function."
https://openalex.org/W2989876636,"To date, there is no direct evidence of telomerase activity in adult lung epithelial cells, but typical culture conditions only support cell proliferation for 30-40 population doublings (PD), a point at which telomeres remain relatively long. Here we report that in in vitro low stress culture conditions consisting of a fibroblast feeder layer, rho-associated coiled coil protein kinase inhibitor (ROCKi), and low oxygen (2%), normal human bronchial epithelial basal progenitor cells (HBECs) divide for over 200 PD without engaging a telomere maintenance mechanism (almost four times the Hayflick limit). HBECs exhibit critically short telomeres at 200 PD and the population of cells start to undergo replicative senescence. Subcloning these late passage cells to clonal density, to mimic lung injury in vivo, selects for rare subsets of HBECs that activate low levels of telomerase activity to maintain short telomeres. CRISPR/Cas9 knockout of human telomerase reverse transcriptase or treatment with the telomerase-mediated telomere targeting agent 6-thio-2'deoxyguanosine abrogates colony growth in these late passage cultures (>200 PD) but not in early passage cultures (<200 PD). To our knowledge, this is the first study to report such long-term growth of HBECs without a telomere maintenance mechanism. This report also provides direct evidence of telomerase activation in HBECs near senescence when telomeres are critically short. This novel cell culture system provides an experimental model to understand how telomerase is regulated in normal adult tissues."
https://openalex.org/W2990925015,"Anti-Mullerian hormone (Amh) is a peptide factor that is known to regulate sexual differentiation and gonadal function in mammals. Although Amh is also suggested to be associated with cognitive development and function in the postnatal brain, little is known about its expression or direct effects on neuronal activities in the hippocampus. Therefore, we assessed Amh and its receptor expression in the hippocampus of male and female mice using PCR, Western blot, and immunofluorescence staining. While Amh-specific receptor expression was comparable between males and females, mRNA and protein levels of Amh were higher in females than those of males. Electrophysiological recordings on acute hippocampal slices showed that exogenous Amh protein addition increased synaptic transmission and long-term synaptic plasticity at the Cornu Ammonis (CA) 3-CA1 synapses. Amh exposure also increased the excitatory postsynaptic potential at CA1 synapses. Our findings support direct and rapid actions of Amh as a paracrine and/or autocrine factor in regulating hippocampal neuronal activities. Data provide functional evidence of Amh-mediated postsynaptic modulation of synaptic transmission and Amh-regulated long-term synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus. These results suggest a potential role of Amh in learning and memory, and a possible cause of the sex differences in cognitive development and function."
https://openalex.org/W2989709318,"Glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) was identified as an enzyme regulating sperm protein phosphatase. The GSK3α paralog, but not GSK3β, is essential for sperm function. Sperm lacking GSK3α display altered motility and are unable to undergo hyperactivation, which is essential for fertilization. Male mice lacking sperm-specific calcineurin (PP2B), a calcium regulated phosphatase, in testis and sperm, are also infertile. Loss of PP2B results in impaired epididymal sperm maturation and motility. The phenotypes of GSK3α and PP2B knockout mice are similar, prompting us to examine the interrelationship between these two enzymes in sperm. High calcium levels must exist to permit catalytically active calcineurin to function during epididymal sperm maturation. Total and free calcium levels are high in immotile compared to motile epididymal sperm. Inhibition of calcineurin by FK506 results in an increase in the net phosphorylation and a consequent decrease in catalytic activity of sperm GSK3. The inhibitor FK506 and an isoform-selective inhibitor of GSK3α, BRD0705, also inhibited fertilization of eggs in vitro. Interrelated functions of GSK3α and sperm PP2B are essential during epididymal sperm maturation and during fertilization. Our results should enable the development of male contraceptives targeting one or both enzymes."
https://openalex.org/W2993361483,"As the key factor of the polarity protein complex, Par6 not only regulates polarization processes, but also plays important roles in tumor metastasis and progression in many epithelium malignancy tumors. Here, we showed that Par6 is an essential component in glioma tumorigenesis. Our results indicated the aberrant expression of Par6 in malignant glioma tissues and cell lines. We found that the regulation of Par6 expression induces cell proliferation and tumor growth in vivo and in vitro. Additionally, RNA-seq revealed the effects of Par6 were associated with cyclin D1-regulated cell cycle progression in glioma cells. Moreover, our results demonstrated that the regulation of Par6 can enhance the activation of Akt/PI3K signaling pathway, and subsequently upregulate the expression level of GSK-3β protein, which then regulate cyclin D1-mediated cell cycle regulation. Furthermore, we found that TGF-β-induced the upregulation of Par6 expression may be involved in this process. The pathological analysis confirmed the correlation between Par6 expression and the prognosis in human glioma tissues, suggesting the regulation of Par6 expression regulates glioma tumorigenesis and progression. Thus, our findings showed that Par6 might be a potential biomarker for the diagnosis and providing a therapeutic strategy for the treatment of malignant glioma."
https://openalex.org/W2991508455,"Muscle wasting, or muscle atrophy, can occur with age, injury, and disease; it affects the quality of life and complicates treatment. Insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) is a key positive regulator of muscle mass. The IGF1/Igf1 gene encodes multiple protein isoforms that differ in tissue expression, potency, and function, particularly in cellular proliferation and differentiation, as well as in systemic versus localized signaling. Genome engineering is a novel strategy for increasing gene expression and has the potential to recapitulate the diverse biology seen in IGF1 signaling through the overexpression of multiple IGF1 isoforms. Using a CRISPR-Cas9 gene activation approach, we showed that the expression of multiple IGF1 or Igf1 mRNA variants can be increased in human and mouse skeletal muscle myoblast cell lines using a single-guide RNA (sgRNA). We found increased IGF1 protein levels in the cell culture media and increased cellular phosphorylation of AKT1, the main effector of IGF1 signaling. We also showed that the expression of Class 1 or Class 2 mRNA variants can be selectively increased by changing the sgRNA target location. The expression of multiple IGF1 or Igf1 mRNA transcript variants in human and mouse skeletal muscle myoblasts promoted myotube differentiation and prevented dexamethasone-induced atrophy in myotubes in vitro. Our findings suggest that this novel approach for enhancing IGF1 signaling has potential therapeutic applications for treating skeletal muscle atrophy."
https://openalex.org/W2994164482,"Ataxia telangiectasia (AT) is a rare, severe, and ineluctably progressive multisystemic neurodegenerative disease. Histone deacetylase 4 (HDAC4) nuclear accumulation has been related to neurodegeneration in AT. Since treatment with glucocorticoid analogues has been shown to improve the neurological symptoms that characterize this syndrome, the effects of dexamethasone on HDAC4 were investigated. In this paper, we describe a novel nonepigenetic function of HDAC4 induced by dexamethasone, through which it can directly modulate HIF-1a activity and promote the upregulation of the DDIT4 gene and protein expression. This new HDAC4 transcription regulation mechanism leads to a positive effect on autophagic flux, an AT-compromised biological pathway. This signaling was specifically induced by dexamethasone only in AT cell lines and can contribute in explaining the positive effects of dexamethasone observed in AT-treated patients."
https://openalex.org/W2990387743,"Kv4 pore-forming subunits co-assemble with β-subunits including KChIP2 and DPP6 and the resultant complexes conduct cardiac transient outward K+ current (Ito). Compound NS5806 has been shown to potentate Ito in canine cardiomyocytes; however, its effects on Ito in other species yet to be determined. We found that NS5806 inhibited native Ito in a concentration-dependent manner (0.1~30 μM) in both mouse ventricular cardiomyocytes and human-induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs), but potentiated Ito in the canine cardiomyocytes. In HEK293 cells co-transfected with cloned Kv4.3 (or Kv4.2) and β-subunit KChIP2, NS5806 significantly increased the peak current amplitude and slowed the inactivation. In contrast, NS5806 suppressed the current and accelerated inactivation of the channels when cells were co-transfected with Kv4.3 (or Kv4.2), KChIP2 and another β-subunit, DPP6-L (long isoform). Western blot analysis showed that DPP6-L was dominantly expressed in both mouse ventricular myocardium and hiPSC-CMs, while it was almost undetectable in canine ventricular myocardium. In addition, low level of DPP6-S expression was found in canine heart, whereas levels of KChIP2 expression were comparable among all three species. siRNA knockdown of DPP6 antagonized the Ito inhibition by NS5806 in hiPSC-CMs. Molecular docking simulation suggested that DPP6-L may associate with KChIP2 subunits. Mutations of putative KChIP2-interacting residues of DPP6-L reversed the inhibitory effect of NS5806 into potentiation of the current. We conclude that a pharmacological modulator can elicit opposite regulatory effects on Kv4 channel complex among different species, depending on the presence of distinct β-subunits. These findings provide novel insight into the molecular design and regulation of cardiac Ito. Since Ito is a potential therapeutic target for treatment of multiple cardiovascular diseases, our data will facilitate the development of new therapeutic Ito modulators."
https://openalex.org/W2993224445,"The readily releasable pool (RRP) of synaptic vesicles is a key determinant of phasic neurotransmission. Although the size of the RRP is tightly regulated by intracellular factors, there is little evidence for its modification by extracellular signals. By studying the homogeneous population of synapses present in autaptic microcultures, we show that pregabalin, a prototypical gabapentinoid, decreases the effective RRP size. Simultaneous imaging of presynaptic calcium influx and recording of postsynaptic responses shows that the effect is not related to a reduction of calcium entry. The main cause is the impairment of the functional coupling among N-type calcium channels and the RRP, resembling an increase of intracellular mobile calcium buffers. The ectodomain of neurexin-1α shows a similar action to pregabalin, acting as an endogenous ligand of α2δ-1 that reduces the RRP size without affecting presynaptic calcium influx. The regulatory actions described for pregabalin and the ectodomain of neurexin-1α are mutually exclusive. The overexpression of α2δ-1 enhances the effect of pregabalin and the ectodomain of neurexin-1α on neurotransmission by decreasing their effective concentration. In contrast, knockdown of α2δ-1 causes a profound inhibition of synaptic transmission. These observations prompt to consider α2δ-1 as an outside-in signaling platform that binds exogenous and endogenous cues for regulating the coupling of voltage-gated calcium channels to synaptic vesicles."
https://openalex.org/W2989807022,"The MRL/MpJ mice have demonstrated an enhanced tissue regeneration capacity for various tissues. In the present study, we systematically characterized bone microarchitecture and found that MRL/MpJ mice exhibit higher bone microarchitecture and strength compared to both C57BL/10J and C57BL/6J WT mice at 2, 4, and 10 months of age. The higher bone mass in MRL/MpJ mice was correlated to increased osteoblasts, decreased osteoclasts, higher cell proliferation, and bone formation, and enhanced pSMAD5 signaling earlier during postnatal development (2-month old) in the spine trabecular bone, and lower bone resorption rate at later age. Furthermore, these mice exhibit accelerated fracture healing via enhanced pSMAD5, pAKT and p-P38MAPK pathways compared to control groups. Moreover, MRL/MpJ mice demonstrated resistance to ovariectomy-induced bone loss as evidenced by maintaining higher bone volume/tissue volume (BV/TV) and lower percentage of bone loss later after ovariectomy. The consistently higher serum IGF1 level and lower RANKL level in MRL/MpJ mice may contribute to the maintenance of high bone mass in uninjured and injured bone. In conclusion, our results indicate that enhanced pSMAD5, pAKT, and p-P38MAPK signaling, higher serum IGF-1, and lower RANKL level contribute to the higher bone microarchitecture and strength, accelerated healing, and resistance to osteoporosis in MRL/MpJ mice."
https://openalex.org/W2990275549,"A glutamic acid to lysine (E40K) residue substitution in superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) is associated with canine degenerative myelopathy: the only naturally occurring large animal model of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). The E40 residue is highly conserved across mammals, except the horse, which naturally carries the (dog mutant) K40 residue. Here we hypothesized that in vitro expression of mutant dog SOD1 would recapitulate features of human ALS (ie, SOD1 protein aggregation, reduced cell viability, perturbations in mitochondrial morphology and membrane potential, reduced ATP production, and increased superoxide ion levels); further, we hypothesized that an equivalent equine SOD1 variant would share similar perturbations in vitro, thereby explain horses' susceptibility to certain neurodegenerative diseases. As in human ALS, expression of mutant dog SOD1 was associated with statistically significant increased aggregate formation, raised superoxide levels (ROS), and altered mitochondrial morphology (increased branching (form factor)), when compared to wild-type dog SOD1-expressing cells. Similar deficits were not detected in cells expressing the equivalent horse SOD1 variant. Our data helps explain the ALS-associated cellular phenotype of dogs expressing the mutant SOD1 protein and reveals that species-specific sequence conservation does not necessarily predict pathogenicity. The work improves understanding of the etiopathogenesis of canine degenerative myelopathy."
https://openalex.org/W2990863830,"Osteopontin (OPN) is a phosphoglycoprotein secreted into the extracellular matrix upon liver injury, acting as a cytokine stimulates the deposition of fibrillary collagen in liver fibrogenesis. In livers of mice subjected to bile duct ligation (BDL) and in cultured activated hepatic stellate cells (HSCs), we show that OPN, besides being overexpressed, is substantially phosphorylated by family with sequence similarity 20, member C (Fam20C), formerly known as Golgi casein kinase (G-CK), which is exclusively resident in the Golgi apparatus. In both experimental models, Fam20C becomes overactive when associated with a 500-kDa multiprotein complex, as compared with the negligible activity in livers of sham-operated rats and in quiescent HSCs. Fam20C knockdown not only confirmed the role of Fam20C itself in OPN phosphorylation, but also revealed that phosphorylation was essential for OPN secretion. However, OPN acts as a fibrogenic factor independently of its phosphorylation state, as demonstrated by the increased expression of Collagen-I by HSCs incubated with either a phosphorylated or nonphosphorylated form of recombinant OPN. Collectively, our results confirm that OPN promotes liver fibrosis and highlight Fam20C as a novel factor driving this process by favoring OPN secretion from HSCs, opening new avenues for deciphering yet unidentified mechanisms underlying liver fibrogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2992529691,"In this study, we examined how channel-forming subunits of the nuclear pore complex (NPC) are assembled into a selective channel within a highly structured scaffold ring during postmitotic assembly. We focused on non-structured domains of the scaffold Nups and performed in vitro self-assembled particle assays with those derived from channel-forming FG-Nups. We found that non-structured domains of ELYS and Nup35N interacted with channel-forming FG-Nups to form a self-assembled particle. Sequential addition of FG-Nups into the scaffold particle revealed that ELYS, which initiates postmitotic NPC reassembly, interacts with early assembling FG-Nups (Nups98 and 153) but not middle stage-assembling FG-Nups (Nups58 and 62). Nup35, which assembles between the early and middle stages, facilitated the assembly of Nup62 into the early assembling Nups both in vitro and in vivo. These results demonstrate that ELYS and Nup35 have a role of facilitator in the ordered assembly of channel-forming FG-Nups during mitosis."
https://openalex.org/W2995235683,"P53 has been implicated in the pathogenesis of obesity and diabetes; however, the mechanisms and tissue sites of action are incompletely defined. Therefore, we investigated the role of hepatocyte p53 in metabolic homeostasis using a hepatocyte-specific p53 knockout mouse model. To gain further mechanistic insight, we studied mice under two complementary conditions of restricted weight gain: vertical sleeve gastrectomy (VSG) or food restriction. VSG or sham surgery was performed in high-fat diet-fed male hepatocyte-specific p53 wild-type and knockout littermates. Sham-operated mice were fed ad libitum or food restricted to match their body weight to VSG-operated mice. Hepatocyte-specific p53 ablation in sham-operated ad libitum-fed mice impaired glucose homeostasis, increased body weight, and decreased energy expenditure without changing food intake. The metabolic deficits induced by hepatocyte-specific p53 ablation were corrected, in part by food restriction, and completely by VSG. Unlike food restriction, VSG corrected the effect of hepatocyte p53 ablation to lower energy expenditure, resulting in a greater improvement in glucose homeostasis compared with food restricted mice. These data reveal an important new role for hepatocyte p53 in the regulation of energy expenditure and body weight and suggest that VSG can improve alterations in energetics associated with p53 dysregulation."
https://openalex.org/W2989992237,"Mutations of PRRT2 (proline-rich transmembrane protein 2) cause several neurological disorders, represented by paroxysmal kinesigenic dyskinesia (PKD), which is characterized by attacks of involuntary movements triggered by sudden voluntary movements. PRRT2 is reported to suppress neuronal excitation, but it is unclear how the function of PRRT2 is modulated during neuronal excitation. We found that PRRT2 is processed to a 12 kDa carboxy-terminal fragment (12K-CTF) by calpain, a calcium-activated cysteine protease, in a neuronal activity-dependent manner, predominantly via NMDA receptors or voltage-gated calcium channels. Furthermore, we clarified that 12K-CTF is generated by sequential cleavages at Q220 and S244. The amino-terminal fragment (NTF) of PRRT2, which corresponds to PKD-related truncated mutants, is not detected, probably due to rapid cleavage at multiple positions. Given that 12K-CTF lacks most of the proline-rich domain, this cleavage might be involved in the activity-dependent enhancement of neuronal excitation perhaps through transient retraction of PRRT2's function. Therefore, PRRT2 might serve as a buffer for neuronal excitation, and lack of this function in PKD patients might cause neuronal hyperexcitability in their motor circuits."
https://openalex.org/W2991239682,"Early pro-inflammatory signaling in the endocrine pancreas involves activation of NF-κB, which is believed to be important for determining the ultimate fate of β-cells and hence progression of type 1 diabetes (T1D). Thus, early non-invasive detection of NF-κB in pancreatic islets may serve as a potential strategy for monitoring early changes in pancreatic endocrine cells eventually leading to T1D. We investigated the feasibility of optical imaging of NF-κB transcription factor activation induced by low-dose streptozocin (LD-STZ) treatment in the immunocompetent SKH1 mouse model of early stage diabetes. In this model, we showed that the levels of NF-κB may be visualized and measured by fluorescence intensity of specific near-infrared (NIR) fluorophore-labeled oligodeoxyribonucleotide duplex (ODND) probes. In addition, NF-κB activation following LD-STZ treatment was validated using immunofluorescence and transgenic animals expressing NF-κB inducible imaging reporter. We showed that LD-STZ-treated SKH1 mice had significantly higher (2-3 times, P < .01) specific NIR FI in the nuclei and cytoplasm of islets cells than in non-treated control mice and this finding was corroborated by immunoblotting and electrophoretic mobility shift assays. Finally, using semi-quantitative confocal analysis of non-fixed pancreatic islet microscopy we demonstrated that ODND probes may be used to distinguish between the islets with high levels of NF-κB transcription factor and control islet cells."
https://openalex.org/W2991327542,"Deletion of murine Thm1, an intraflagellar transport A (IFT-A) component that mediates ciliary protein trafficking, causes hyperphagia, obesity, and metabolic syndrome. The role of Thm1 or IFT-A in adipogenesis and insulin sensitivity is unknown. Here, we report that Thm1 knockdown in 3T3-L1 pre-adipocytes promotes adipogenesis and enhances insulin sensitivity in vitro. Yet, pre-obese Thm1 conditional knockout mice show systemic insulin resistance. While insulin-induced AKT activation in Thm1 mutant adipose depots and skeletal muscle are similar to those of control littermates, an attenuated insulin response arises in the mutant liver. Insulin treatment of control and Thm1 mutant primary hepatocytes results in similar AKT activation. Moreover, pair-feeding Thm1 conditional knockout mice produces a normal insulin response, both in the liver and systemically. Thus, hyperphagia caused by a cilia defect, induces hepatic insulin resistance via a non-cell autonomous mechanism. In turn, hepatic insulin resistance drives systemic insulin resistance prior to an obese phenotype. These data demonstrate that insulin signaling across cell types is regulated differentially, and that the liver is particularly susceptible to hyperphagia-induced insulin resistance and a critical determinant of systemic insulin resistance."

In this article, we evaluate the consequence of hyperosmotic medium on cellular energy metabolism. We demonstrate that exposure of cells to hyperosmotic conditions immediately reduces the mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation rate. This causes an increase in glycolysis, which represses further respiration. This is known as the Warburg or Crabtree effect. In addition to aerobic glycolysis, we observed two other cellular responses that would help to preserve cellular ATP level and viability: A reduction in the cellular ATP turnover rate and a partial mitochondrial uncoupling which is expected to enhance ATP production by Krebs cycle. The latter is likely to constitute another metabolic adaptation to compensate for deficient oxidative phosphorylation that, importantly, is not dependent on glucose."
