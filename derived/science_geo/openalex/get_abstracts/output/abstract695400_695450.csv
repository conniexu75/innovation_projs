https://openalex.org/W4283015409,"Gastrulation controls the emergence of cellular diversity and axis patterning in the early embryo. In mammals, this transformation is orchestrated by dynamic signalling centres at the interface of embryonic and extraembryonic tissues1-3. Elucidating the molecular framework of axis formation in vivo is fundamental for our understanding of human development4-6 and to advance stem-cell-based regenerative approaches7. Here we illuminate early gastrulation of marmoset embryos in utero using spatial transcriptomics and stem-cell-based embryo models. Gaussian process regression-based 3D transcriptomes delineate the emergence of the anterior visceral endoderm, which is hallmarked by conserved (HHEX, LEFTY2, LHX1) and primate-specific (POSTN, SDC4, FZD5) factors. WNT signalling spatially coordinates the formation of the primitive streak in the embryonic disc and is counteracted by SFRP1 and SFRP2 to sustain pluripotency in the anterior domain. Amnion specification occurs at the boundaries of the embryonic disc through ID1, ID2 and ID3 in response to BMP signalling, providing a developmental rationale for amnion differentiation of primate pluripotent stem cells (PSCs). Spatial identity mapping demonstrates that primed marmoset PSCs exhibit the highest similarity to the anterior embryonic disc, whereas naive PSCs resemble the preimplantation epiblast. Our 3D transcriptome models reveal the molecular code of lineage specification in the primate embryo and provide an in vivo reference to decipher human development."

Here, a wastewater-based epidemiology approach has been used to monitor 16 schools (10 primary, 5 secondary and 1 post-16 and further education) in England. A total of 296 samples over 9 weeks have been analysed for N1 and E genes using qPCR methods. Of the samples returned, 47.3% were positive for one or both genes with a detection frequency in line with the respective local community. WBE offers a low cost, non-invasive approach for supplementing clinical testing and can provide longitudinal insights that are impractical with traditional clinical testing."
https://openalex.org/W4282982285,"Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a common complex condition associated with high morbidity and mortality. Polygenic prediction could enhance CKD screening and prevention; however, this approach has not been optimized for ancestrally diverse populations. By combining APOL1 risk genotypes with genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of kidney function, we designed, optimized and validated a genome-wide polygenic score (GPS) for CKD. The new GPS was tested in 15 independent cohorts, including 3 cohorts of European ancestry (n = 97,050), 6 cohorts of African ancestry (n = 14,544), 4 cohorts of Asian ancestry (n = 8,625) and 2 admixed Latinx cohorts (n = 3,625). We demonstrated score transferability with reproducible performance across all tested cohorts. The top 2% of the GPS was associated with nearly threefold increased risk of CKD across ancestries. In African ancestry cohorts, the APOL1 risk genotype and polygenic component of the GPS had additive effects on the risk of CKD. A new study generated and optimized a polygenic score for chronic kidney disease with reproducible performance across 15 cohorts of different ancestries, and identified potentially clinically relevant thresholds with predicted effects comparable to having a family history of the disease."
https://openalex.org/W4282960093,"Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a T cell-mediated autoimmune disease of the central nervous system (CNS). Bone marrow hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) rapidly sense immune activation, yet their potential interplay with autoreactive T cells in MS is unknown. Here, we report that bone marrow HSPCs are skewed toward myeloid lineage concomitant with the clonal expansion of T cells in MS patients. Lineage tracing in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, a mouse model of MS, reveals remarkable bone marrow myelopoiesis with an augmented output of neutrophils and Ly6Chigh monocytes that invade the CNS. We found that myelin-reactive T cells preferentially migrate into the bone marrow compartment in a CXCR4-dependent manner. This aberrant bone marrow myelopoiesis involves the CCL5-CCR5 axis and augments CNS inflammation and demyelination. Our study suggests that targeting the bone marrow niche presents an avenue to treat MS and other autoimmune disorders."
https://openalex.org/W4282972656,"Abstract Timely evaluation of the protective effects of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccines against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variants of concern is urgently needed to inform pandemic control planning. Based on 78 vaccine efficacy or effectiveness (VE) data from 49 studies and 1,984,241 SARS-CoV-2 sequences collected from 31 regions, we analyzed the relationship between genetic distance (GD) of circulating viruses against the vaccine strain and VE against symptomatic infection. We found that the GD of the receptor-binding domain of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein is highly predictive of vaccine protection and accounted for 86.3% ( P = 0.038) of the VE change in a vaccine platform-based mixed-effects model and 87.9% ( P = 0.006) in a manufacturer-based model. We applied the VE-GD model to predict protection mediated by existing vaccines against new genetic variants and validated the results by published real-world and clinical trial data, finding high concordance of predicted VE with observed VE. We estimated the VE against the Delta variant to be 82.8% (95% prediction interval: 68.7–96.0) using the mRNA vaccine platform, closely matching the reported VE of 83.0% from an observational study. Among the four sublineages of Omicron, the predicted VE varied between 11.9% and 33.3%, with the highest VE predicted against BA.1 and the lowest against BA.2, using the mRNA vaccine platform. The VE-GD framework enables predictions of vaccine protection in real time and offers a rapid evaluation method against novel variants that may inform vaccine deployment and public health responses."

https://openalex.org/W4283017911,"The identification of general and efficient methods for the construction of oligosaccharides stands as one of the great challenges for the field of synthetic chemistry1,2. Selective glycosylation of unprotected sugars and other polyhydroxylated nucleophiles is a particularly significant goal, requiring not only control over the stereochemistry of the forming bond but also differentiation between similarly reactive nucleophilic sites in stereochemically complex contexts3,4. Chemists have generally relied on multi-step protecting-group strategies to achieve site control in glycosylations, but practical inefficiencies arise directly from the application of such approaches5–7. Here we describe a strategy for small-molecule-catalyst-controlled, highly stereo- and site-selective glycosylations of unprotected or minimally protected mono- and disaccharides using precisely designed bis-thiourea small-molecule catalysts. Stereo- and site-selective galactosylations and mannosylations of a wide assortment of polyfunctional nucleophiles is thereby achieved. Kinetic and computational studies provide evidence that site-selectivity arises from stabilizing C–H/π interactions between the catalyst and the nucleophile, analogous to those documented in sugar-binding proteins. This work demonstrates that highly selective glycosylation reactions can be achieved through control of stabilizing non-covalent interactions, a potentially general strategy for selective functionalization of carbohydrates. A simplified synthesis strategy for stereo- and site-selective glycosylations, using minimally protected mono- and disaccharides and thiourea small-molecule catalysts, enables highly selective functionalization of carbohydrates."

https://openalex.org/W4283031078,"Metabarcoding of environmental DNA is increasingly used for biodiversity assessments in aquatic communities. The efficiency and outcome of these efforts are dependent upon either de novo primer design or selecting an appropriate primer set from the dozens that have already been published. Unfortunately, there is a lack of studies that have directly compared the efficacy of different metabarcoding primers in marine and estuarine systems. Here we evaluate five commonly used primer sets designed to amplify rRNA barcoding genes in fishes and compare their performance using water samples collected from estuarine sites in the highly biodiverse Indian River Lagoon in Florida. Three of the five primer sets amplify a portion of the mitochondrial 12S gene (MiFish_12S, 171bp; Riaz_12S, 106 bp; Valentini_12S, 63 bp), one amplifies 219 bp of the mitochondrial 16S gene (Berry_16S), and the other amplifies 271 bp of the nuclear 18S gene (MacDonald_18S). The vast majority of the metabarcoding reads (> 99%) generated using the 18S primer set assigned to non-target (non-fish) taxa and therefore this primer set was omitted from most analyses. Using a conservative 99% similarity threshold for species level assignments, we detected a comparable number of species (55 and 49, respectively) and similarly high Shannon's diversity values for the Riaz_12S and Berry_16S primer sets. Meanwhile, just 34 and 32 species were detected using the MiFish_12S and Valentini_12S primer sets, respectively. We were able to amplify both bony and cartilaginous fishes using the four primer sets with the vast majority of reads (>99%) assigned to the former. We detected the greatest number of elasmobranchs (six species) with the Riaz_12S primer set suggesting that it may be a suitable candidate set for the detection of sharks and rays. Of the total 76 fish species that were identified across all datasets, the combined three 12S primer sets detected 85.5% (65 species) while the combination of the Riaz_12S and Berry_16S primers detected 93.4% (71 species). These results highlight the importance of employing multiple primer sets as well as using primers that target different genomic regions. Moreover, our results suggest that the widely adopted MiFish_12S primers may not be the best choice, rather we found that the Riaz_12S primer set was the most effective for eDNA-based fish surveys in our system."
https://openalex.org/W4282964113,"Sulfated glycans are ubiquitous nutrient sources for microbial communities that have coevolved with eukaryotic hosts. Bacteria metabolize sulfated glycans by deploying carbohydrate sulfatases that remove sulfate esters. Despite the biological importance of sulfatases, the mechanisms underlying their ability to recognize their glycan substrate remain poorly understood. Here, we use structural biology to determine how sulfatases from the human gut microbiota recognize sulfated glycans. We reveal seven new carbohydrate sulfatase structures spanning four S1 sulfatase subfamilies. Structures of S1_16 and S1_46 represent novel structures of these subfamilies. Structures of S1_11 and S1_15 demonstrate how non-conserved regions of the protein drive specificity toward related but distinct glycan targets. Collectively, these data reveal that carbohydrate sulfatases are highly selective for the glycan component of their substrate. These data provide new approaches for probing sulfated glycan metabolism while revealing the roles carbohydrate sulfatases play in host glycan catabolism. Comprehensive structural biology analysis of seven members of the S1 carbohydrate sulfatase family derived from human gut microbiome Bacteroides reveals mechanisms of glycan recognition and sulfate hydrolysis."
https://openalex.org/W4283067903,"Excessive cardiac fibrosis and inflammation aberrantly contribute to the progressive pathogenesis of arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy (ACM). Whether sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitor (SGLT2i), as a new hypoglycemic drug, benefits ACM remains unclear. Cardiomyocyte-specific Dsg2 exon-11 knockout and wild-type (WT) littermate mice were used as the animal model of ACM and controls, respectively. Mice were administered by gavage with either SGLT2i dapagliflozin (DAPA, 1 mg/kg/day) or vehicle alone for 8 weeks. HL-1 cells were treated with DAPA to identify the molecular mechanism in vitro. All mice presented normal glucose homeostasis. DAPA not only significantly ameliorated cardiac dysfunction, adverse remodeling, and ventricular dilation in ACM but also attenuated ACM-associated cardiac fibrofatty replacement, as demonstrated by the echocardiography and histopathological examination. The protein expressions of HIF-2α and HIF-1α were decreased and increased respectively in cardiac tissue of ACM, which were compromised after DAPA treatment. Additionally, NF-κB P65 and IκB phosphorylation, as well as fibrosis indicators (including TGF-β, α-SMA, Collagen I, and Collagen III) were increased in ACM. However, these trends were markedly suppressed by DAPA treatment. Consistent with these results in vitro, DAPA alleviated the IκB phosphorylation and NF-κB p65 transcriptional activity in DSG2-knockdown HL-1 cells. Interestingly, the elective HIF-2α inhibitor PT2399 almost completely blunted the DAPA-mediated downregulation of indicators concerning cardiac fibrosis and inflammation. SGLT2i attenuated the ACM-associated cardiac dysfunction and adverse remodeling in a glucose-independent manner by suppressing cardiac fibrosis and inflammation via reverting the HIF-2α signaling pathway, suggesting that SGLT2i is a novel and available therapy for ACM."

https://openalex.org/W4283067167,"The cellular adaptive response to hypoxia relies on the expression of hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs), HIF-1 and HIF-2. HIFs regulate global gene expression changes during hypoxia that are necessary for restoring oxygen homeostasis and promoting cell survival. In the early stages of hypoxia, HIF-1 is elevated, whereas at the later stages, HIF-2 becomes the predominant form. What governs the transition between the two HIFs (the HIF switch) and the role of miRNAs in this regulation are not completely clear. Genome-wide expression studies on the miRNA content of RNA-induced silencing complexes (RISC) in HUVECs exposed to hypoxia compared to the global miRNA-Seq analysis revealed very specific differences between these two populations. We analyzed the miRNA and mRNA composition of RISC at 2 h (mainly HIF-1 driven), 8 h (HIF-1 and HIF-2 elevated), and 16 h (mainly HIF-2 driven) in a gene ontology context. This allowed for determining the direct impact of the miRNAs in modulating the cellular signaling pathways involved in the hypoxic adaptive response. Our results indicate that the miRNA-mRNA RISC components control the adaptive responses, and this does not always rely on the miRNA transcriptional elevations during hypoxia. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the hypoxic levels of the vast majority of HIF-1-dependent miRNAs (including miR-210-3p) are also HIF-2 dependent and that HIF-2 governs the expression of 11 specific miRNAs. In summary, the switch from HIF-1 to HIF-2 during hypoxia provides an important level of miRNA-driven control in the adaptive pathways in endothelial cells."

This study assess the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on undergraduate dental students at Faculty of Dentistry, University of Malaya. The objective of this study is to evaluate the impact of the pandemic on physical and mental health of undergraduate dental students.This is a cross-sectional study. An online questionnaire was administrated to 150 undergraduate dental students. The questionnaire included questions related to students' demographic data, their concerns on academic achievement, their opinion on institution response, and the impact of the crisis on their mental and physical health. SPSS software v26.0 was used to analyse the collected data.A total of 147 respondents participated in the study. About 66% of the students felt comfortable in adapting to the new technology while 85.7% were concerned about the quality of online learning. Almost all students 98.6% expressed their doubts on the ability to pass the competency exams and to graduate on time, with only 49.7% agreed that clinical experience was effectively delivered through online classes. Most students were also concerned on the impact of the pandemic on their physical and emotional health 85.8% and 76.9% respectively.The findings of our study highlight the positive adaptation of the students to online learning and using technology. On the other hand, the study indicates that the COVID-19 pandemic brings negative impacts on our students' physical and mental health."
https://openalex.org/W4283009884,"As countries underwent the initiation, peak, post-peak, and early vaccination stages of COVID-19, the changing risk perception, coping behaviors and corresponding psychological stress experienced by the public over time was rarely reported. We conducted a national scale panel study using social-psychological data collected from 5,983 questionnaires to investigate the interactions between anxiety level, risk perception and coping behavior during different stages of COVID-19 in China. We found that sustained perceiving worries of being infected, first due to domestic and then global pandemic, contributed to the persistent high proportion of respondents with anxiety disorders which even gradually increased over time (56.1% during initiation to 60.4% during early vaccination). Gender was the strongest predictor of anxiety at all stages, with females having less confidence in COVID-19 control and always suffering from much higher anxiety levels than males even during the post peak stage. Excessive protective behavior and frequency of access to COVID-related news also contributed to public anxiety. Additionally, public risk perception was significantly associated with their willingness to vaccinate. The findings verify the feasibility of taking stage-specific and gender-based risk communication strategies to alleviate the pandemic-related public anxiety and promote vaccination by influencing public risk perception and guiding coping behaviors."

In this study, we aimed to develop artificial intelligence-based software for the segmentation of rectal cancer that can be used for staging to optimize treatment strategy and for preoperative surgical simulation.Images from a total of 201 patients who underwent preoperative MRI were analyzed for training data. The resected specimen was processed in a circular shape in 103 cases. Using these datasets, ground-truth labels were prepared by annotating MR images with ground-truth segmentation labels of tumor area based on pathologically confirmed lesions. In addition, the areas of rectum and mesorectum were also labeled. An automatic segmentation algorithm was developed using a U-net deep neural network.The developed algorithm could estimate the area of the tumor, rectum, and mesorectum. The Dice similarity coefficients between manual and automatic segmentation were 0.727, 0.930, and 0.917 for tumor, rectum, and mesorectum, respectively. The T2/T3 diagnostic sensitivity, specificity, and overall accuracy were 0.773, 0.768, and 0.771, respectively.This algorithm can provide objective analysis of MR images at any institution, and aid risk stratification in rectal cancer and the tailoring of individual treatments.

https://openalex.org/W4283008571,"Dietary phosphate intake in the Western population greatly exceeds the recommended dietary allowance and is linked to enhanced cardiovascular and all-cause mortality. It is unclear whether a chronic high phosphate diet (HPD) causes kidney injury in healthy individuals. Here, we show that feeding a 2% HPD in C57BL/6N mice for one up to six months resulted in hyperphosphatemia, hyperphosphaturia, increased plasma levels of fibroblast growth factor (FGF) 23, and parathyroid hormone (PTH) compared to mice on a 0.8% phosphate diet. Kidney injury was already noted after two months of HPD characterized by loss of proximal tubular (PT) cell polarity, flattened epithelia, disruption of brush border membranes, vacuolization, increased PT cell proliferation, marked interstitial mononuclear infiltration, and progressive accumulation of collagen fibers. HPD increased Stat3 activation and Kim-1 expression in PT epithelial cells and enhanced renal synthesis of chemokines recruiting monocytes and macrophages as well as macrophage related factors. Enhanced recruitment of F4/80+ macrophages around injured PT lesions was timely associated with increased Kim-1 synthesis, tubular MCP-1 expression, and degree of PT injury score. Likewise, tubulointerstitial fibrosis was associated with activation of Stat3/Kim-1 signaling pathway. The stimulation of human proximal tubular cells with high phosphate activated Stat3 signaling and induced HAVCR1 and CCL2 expression. We conclude that high phosphate results in progressive proximal tubular injury, indicating that high dietary phosphate intake may affect kidney health and therefore represents an underestimated health problem for the general population."
https://openalex.org/W4283071968,"Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a heterogeneous disease characterized by complex molecular and cytogenetic abnormalities. New approaches to predict the prognosis of AML have increasingly attracted attention. There were 98 non-M3 AML cases and 48 healthy controls were enrolled in the current work. Clinically routine assays for cytogenetic and molecular genetic analyses were performed on the bone marrow samples of patients with AML. Meanwhile, metabolic profiling of these AML subjects was also performed on the serum samples by combining Ag nanoparticle-based surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) with proton nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. Although most of the routine biochemical test showed no significant differences between the M0–M2 and M5 groups, the metabolic profiles were significantly different either between AML subtypes or between prognostic risk subgroups. Specific SERS bands were screened to serve as potential markers for AML subtypes. The results demonstrated that the classification models for M0–M2 and M5 shared two bands (i.e., 1328 and 741 cm−1), all came from nucleic acid signals. Furthermore, Metabolic profiles provided various differential metabolites responsible for different AML subtypes, and we found altered pathways mainly included energy metabolism like glycolysis, pyruvate metabolism, and metabolisms of nucleic acid bases as well as specific amino acid metabolisms. It is concluded that integration of SERS and NMR provides the rational and could be reliable to reveal AML differentiation, and meanwhile lay the basis for experimental and clinical practice to monitor disease progression and prognostic evaluation."
https://openalex.org/W4283009139,"Although recombinant proteins are widely used in biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries, improving their solubility and stability is often a challenging issue. We recently discovered a class of highly unstructured heat-resistant obscure (Hero) proteins, which function to protect other ""client"" proteins in trans from various stresses in vitro and in vivo. Here, we show that fusion of Hero proteins in cis can enhance the molecular property of recombinant proteins. Fusion with Hero11 improved the otherwise challenging production of TAR DNA-binding protein of 43 kDa (TDP-43) in Escherichia coli. Moreover, fusing with Hero9 strongly protected the activity of firefly luciferase bearing destabilizing mutations against heat and other stress conditions. These data suggest that Hero proteins have the potential to be used as versatile stabilization tags for recombinant protein production."
https://openalex.org/W4283023929,"As countries struggled with SARS-COV2 outbreaks at the beginning of 2021, many citizens found themselves in yet another period of increasing travel restrictions, if not a strict lockdown. At the same time there was concern that further restrictions would prove to be less effective due to a range of reasons including increasing pandemic fatigue or the lack of appropriate supports. In this study we investigate whether restrictions remained effective as a way to limit non-essential travel in order to curb virus transmission. We do this by analysing adherence during periods of increasing and decreasing restrictions in 125 countries during three different 4-month phases, early (March-June 2020), middle (July-October 2020), and late (November 2020-February 2021) over the course of the first year of the pandemic, and prior to significant population-wide vaccination. We use the strength of the relationship between restriction levels and the level of personal mobility associated with non-essential travel in order to determine the degree of adherence to the restrictions imposed. We show that there is evidence of a significant decrease in adherence to restrictions during the middle and late phases of the pandemic, compared with the early phase. Our analysis further suggests that this decrease in adherence is due to changes in mobility rather than changes in restrictions. We conclude, therefore, that restrictions have become less effective at curbing non-essential travel, which may alter the cost-benefit analysis of restrictions and lockdowns, thus highlighting the need for governments to reconsider large-scale restrictions as a containment strategy in the future, in favour of more focused or flexible mitigation approaches."

The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of astrocyte depletion upon the clinical outcome and the composition of ECM glycoproteins in a virus-induced animal model of demyelination. Glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)-thymidine-kinase transgenic SJL (GFAP-knockout) and wildtype mice were infected with Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV). Astrocyte depletion was induced during the progressive, demyelinating disease phase by ganciclovir administration once daily between 56 and 77 days post infection (dpi). At 77 dpi GFAP-knockout mice showed a significant deterioration of clinical signs associated with a reduction of azan and picrosirius red stained ECM-molecules in the thoracic spinal cord. Basement-membrane-associated ECM-molecules including laminin, entactin/nidogen-1 and Kir4.1 as well as non-basement membrane-associated ECM-molecules like collagen I, decorin, tenascin-R and CD44 were significantly reduced in the spinal cord of GFAP-knockout mice. The reduction of the investigated ECM-molecules demonstrates that astrocytes play a key role in the production of ECM-molecules. The present findings indicate that the detected loss of Kir4.1 and CD44 as well as the disruption of the integrity of perineuronal nets led to the deterioration of clinical signs in GFAP-knockout mice."
https://openalex.org/W4283073047,"Metabolomics has emerged as a powerful new tool in precision medicine. No studies have yet been published on the metabolomic changes in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) produced by acute endurance exercise. CSF and plasma were collected from 19 young active adults (13 males and 6 females) before and 60 min after a 90-min monitored outdoor run. The median age, BMI, and VO2 max of subjects was 25 years (IQR 22–31), 23.2 kg/m2 (IQR 21.7–24.5), and 47 ml/kg/min (IQR 38–51), respectively. Targeted, broad-spectrum metabolomics was performed by liquid chromatography, tandem mass spectrometry (LC–MS/MS). In the CSF, purines and pyrimidines accounted for 32% of the metabolic impact after acute endurance exercise. Branch chain amino acids, amino acid neurotransmitters, fatty acid oxidation, phospholipids, and Krebs cycle metabolites traceable to mitochondrial function accounted for another 52% of the changes. A narrow but important channel of metabolic communication was identified between the brain and body by correlation network analysis. By comparing these results to previous work in experimental animal models, we found that over 80% of the changes in the CSF correlated with a cascade of mitochondrial and metabolic changes produced by ATP signaling. ATP is released as a co-neurotransmitter and neuromodulator at every synapse studied to date. By regulating brain mitochondrial function, ATP release was identified as an early step in the kinetic cascade of layered benefits produced by endurance exercise."
https://openalex.org/W4283013111,"Hypoxia and inflammatory mediators stabilize hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1α through posttranslational modifications, such as phosphorylation and succinylation. Here, we identified sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) and 60 kDa Tat-interactive protein (Tip60)-mediated acetylation as another critical posttranslational modification that regulates HIF-1α protein stability under lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation. Mechanistically, DNA damage induced by excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS) activated poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1) to consume oxidized nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+). Correspondingly, SIRT1 activity was decreased with the decline in NAD+ levels, resulting in increased HIF-1α acetylation. LPS also activated the ATP-citrate lyase (ACLY)-Tip60 pathway to further enhance HIF-1α acetylation. Acetylation contributed to HIF-1α stability and exacerbated LPS-induced inflammation. Thus, inhibiting HIF-1α stability by decreasing its acetylation could partly alleviate LPS-induced inflammation. In conclusion, we revealed the mechanism by which LPS stabilized HIF-1α by increasing its acetylation via the PARP1-SIRT1 and ACLY-Tip60 pathways in fish macrophages. This study may provide novel insights for manipulation of HIF-1α acetylation as a therapeutic strategy against inflammation from the perspective of acetylation in vertebrates."

Risk of bias assessment of the studies included in the review will occur using the Cochrane risk of bias tool for randomized trials (RoB 2). Frequentist method network meta-analyses (NMA) will compare each outcome's risk across both types of anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents in one model and each in separate models. Additional NMA models will compare these in COVID-19 patients who were severely or critically ill, immunocompromised, admitted to the intensive care unit, diagnosed by nucleic acid amplification test, not treated with steroids, <18 years old, and at risk of infection due to variants of concern. The plan of excluding non-hospitalized patients from the proposed review is to minimize intransitivity risk. The acceptance of the network consistency assumption will transpire if the local and overall inconsistency assessment indicates no inconsistency. For each NMA model, the effect sizes (risk ratio) and their 95% confidence intervals will get reported in league tables. The best intervention prediction and quality of evidence grading will happen using the surface under the cumulative ranking curve values and the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation-based Confidence in Network Meta-Analysis approach, respectively. Sensitivity analysis will repeat the preliminary NMA while excluding the trials at high risk of bias. The Stata statistical software (v16) will be used for analysis.

However, the functional consequences of N-terminal FUS phosphorylation are unknown. To gain insight into this question, we utilized proximity-dependent biotin labeling via ascorbate peroxidase 2 aired with mass spectrometry to investigate whether N-terminal phosphorylation alters the FUS protein–protein interaction network (interactome), and subsequently, FUS function. We report the first analysis comparing the interactomes of three FUS variants: homeostatic wildtype FUS (FUS WT), phosphomimetic FUS (FUS PM; a proxy for N-terminally phosphorylated FUS), and the toxic FUS proline 525 to leucine mutant (FUS P525L) that causes juvenile amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. We found that the phosphomimetic FUS interactome is uniquely enriched for a group of cytoplasmic proteins that mediate mRNA metabolism and translation, as well as nuclear proteins involved in the spliceosome and DNA repair functions. Furthermore, we identified and validated the RNA-induced silencing complex RNA helicase MOV10 as a novel interacting partner of FUS.

Taken together, these results highlight phosphorylation as a unique modulator of the interactome and function of FUS. Frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by atrophy of the frontal and temporal lobes. Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is the clinical manifestation of FTLD (1Bang J. Spina S. Miller B.L.

However, it remains unclear what triggers of FUS mislocalization are essential in eliciting FTLD–ALS disease pathogenesis.Various factors may contribute to the development of cytoplasmic FUS inclusions. Genetic mutations in FUS typically cause ALS and are rarely associated with FTLD (8Kwiatkowski Jr., T.J. Bosco D.A. Leclerc A.L. Tamrazian E. Vanderburg C.R.

Thus, the proximal cause of FUS pathology in FTLD is unknown.

Root J. et al.Divergent FUS phosphorylation in primate and mouse cells following double-strand DNA damage.Neurobiol. Dis. 2020; 146105085Crossref Scopus (1) Google Scholar). This cascade is triggered by double-strand DNA breaks (DSBs). Studies have found that FTLD and ALS exhibit markers of DNA damage (37Higelin J. Demestre M. Putz S. Delling J.P. Jacob C. Lutz A.K. et al.FUS mislocalization and vulnerability to DNA damage in ALS patients derived hiPSCs and aging motoneurons.Front.

Neurosci. 2013; 16: 1383-1391Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Given this, the cytoplasmic relocalization of FUS induced by N-terminal phosphorylation may contribute to pathology in a subset of FTLD and ALS cases. However, it remains unclear whether N-terminal phosphorylation alters FUS function. Therefore, we aimed to elucidate how the FUS protein interactome changed in response to phosphorylation at these 12 key N-terminal residues.Chemically induced DSBs not only lead to robust phosphorylation of FUS but also induce multiple kinases and DNA repair cascades that may mask the specific effect of N-terminal FUS phosphorylation and make proteomic analysis challenging (50Elmroth K. Nygren J. Martensson S. Ismail I.H. Hammarsten O. Cleavage of cellular DNA by calicheamicin gamma1.DNA Repair (Amst). 2003; 2: 363-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). To overcome this hurdle, we expressed a phosphomimetic variant of FUS (FUS PM) that mimics the cytoplasmic localization of FUS caused by DSBs (46Deng Q. Holler C.J. Taylor G. Hudson K.F. Watkins W. Gearing M. et al.FUS is phosphorylated by DNA-PK and accumulates in the cytoplasm after DNA damage.J. Neurosci. 2014; 34: 7802-7813Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 48Johnson M.A. Deng Q.

Dis. 2020; 146105085Crossref Scopus (1) Google Scholar). We engineered synthetic genes that fused ascorbate peroxidase 2 (APEX2) to human wild-type FUS (FUS WT), FUS PM, or the ALS-linked mutant P525L (FUS P525L [FUS proline 525 to leucine mutant]) to enable proximity-dependent biotinylation of potential protein-binding partners (51Lam S.S. Martell J.D. Kamer K.J. Deerinck T.J. Ellisman M.H. Mootha V.K. et al.Directed evolution of APEX2 for electron microscopy and proximity labeling.Nat. Methods. 2015; 12: 51-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar). We then performed label-free mass spectrometry (MS) on biotinylated proteins to determine whether N-terminal phosphorylation alters the protein-binding partners of FUS (51Lam S.S. Martell J.D. Kamer K.J. Deerinck T.J. Ellisman M.H. Mootha V.K. et al.Directed evolution of APEX2 for electron microscopy and proximity labeling.Nat. Methods. 2015; 12: 51-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar). Differential expression analysis revealed that the FUS PM interactome compared with FUS WT was enriched for cytoplasmic proteins involved in “mRNA catabolic process,” “translation initiation,” and “stress granule assembly.” In contrast, the FUS PM interactome compared with FUS P525L was enriched for nuclear proteins involved in functions, such as “spliceosome,” “ribonucleoprotein complex biogenesis,” and “covalent chromatin modification.” We found that cells expressing FUS PM exhibited functional alterations in the steady-state levels of certain mRNAs and global translation. Taken together, these data suggest that phosphorylation results in a novel FUS interactome that exists between the pathogenic FUS P525L ALS-linked mutation and the homeostatic functions of FUS WT. Our analysis is the first comprehensive study how a disease-relevant PTM in FUS may shift its protein interactome toward a disease state. Findings from these studies will inform how phosphorylation of FUS and the ALS-linked FUS mutation P525L contribute to neurodegeneration.ResultsAPEX2-tagged FUS PM recapitulates p-FUS localization phenotypeFUS dysfunction is a hallmark of FTD and ALS disease pathogenesis (6Mackenzie I.R.A.

However, many fundamental aspects of FUS regulation are unknown. For example, it remains unclear how phosphorylation of FUS, or the presence of ALS-associated mutations, alters the function of FUS and associated pathways. To gain insight into these questions, we set out to define the protein-binding network, or interactome, of FUS by performing proximity labeling mediated by APEX2 (51Lam S.S. Martell J.D. Kamer K.J. Deerinck T.J. Ellisman M.H. Mootha V.K. et al.Directed evolution of APEX2 for electron microscopy and proximity labeling.Nat. Methods. 2015; 12: 51-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar). We fused APEX2 to the N terminus of three FUS protein variants via a (GGGS)3-FLAG tag linker to generate three Twin-Strep-tagged constructs: (1) FUS WT, (2) FUS PM, and (3) the ALS-linked FUS P525L (Fig. 1, A and B). FUS PM was generated by substituting the 12 serine/threonine residues that are phosphorylated by DNA-PK following DSB with the negatively charged amino acid aspartate (46Deng Q. Holler C.J. Taylor G. Hudson K.F. Watkins W. Gearing M. et al.FUS is phosphorylated by DNA-PK and accumulates in the cytoplasm after DNA damage.J.

Root J. et al.Divergent FUS phosphorylation in primate and mouse cells following double-strand DNA damage.Neurobiol. Dis. 2020; 146105085Crossref Scopus (1) Google Scholar). FUS P525L was generated by substituting leucine for proline at position 525. The FUS P525L mutation, which causes a severe form of juvenile ALS, robustly increases cytoplasmic localization of FUS and alters the transcriptome, proteome, and the spliceosome in multiple model systems (18De Santis R.

Therefore, the APEX2-FUS P525L mutant (1) served as a positive control for FUS cytoplasmic localization, (2) provided insight into the pathogenic nature of ALS-linked mutations, and (3) was a useful comparison to determine if FUS PM resembles a known pathogenic phenotype (44Monahan Z.

Endogenous FUS protein was enriched in the nuclear fraction, and the ratio of cytoplasmic/nuclear FUS was unchanged regardless of APEX2-fusion protein expression, suggesting expression of our APEX2 fusion constructs did not disrupt endogenous FUS expression (Fig. 1, C and D). Previously, we reported that the cytoplasmic localization of phosphorylated FUS induced by DSB can be mimicked by phosphomimetic substitution of the 12 consensus DNA-PK phosphorylation sites (serine/threonine_glutamine [S/T_Q]) with aspartate (D) (46Deng Q. Holler C.J. Taylor G. Hudson K.F. Watkins W. Gearing M. et al.FUS is phosphorylated by DNA-PK and accumulates in the cytoplasm after DNA damage.J.

As anticipated, a larger proportion of APEX2-FUS PM was found in the cytoplasm compared with the nucleus via immunoblot (Fig. 1E). FUS-ALS mutations such as P525L typically induce an accumulation of FUS into insoluble cytoplasmic inclusions (9Neumann M. Rademakers R. Roeber S. Baker M. Kretzschmar H.A. Mackenzie I.R.

The aim of this study was to determine if ageing altered total collagen content and distribution in the human colon. Methods Macroscopically normal ascending colon was obtained at surgery from cancer patients (n = 31) without diagnosis of diverticular disease or inflammatory bowel disease. Masson’s trichrome and Picrosirius red stains were employed to identify the total collagen content and distribution within the sublayers of the colonic wall for adult (22–60 years; 6 males, 6 females) and elderly (70 – 91years; 6 males, 4 female) patients. A hydroxyproline assay evaluated the total collagen concentration for adult (30–64 years; 9 male, 6 female) and elderly (66–91 years; 8 male, 8 female) patients. Key results Histological studies showed that the percentage mean intensity of total collagen staining in the mucosa, submucosa and muscularis externa was, respectively, 14(1.9) %, 74(3.2) % and 12(1.5) % in the adult ascending colon. Compared with the adults, the total collagen fibres content was increased in the submucosa (mean intensity; 163.1 ± 11.1 vs. 124.5 ± 7.8; P &lt; 0.05) and muscularis externa (42.5 ± 8.0 vs. 20.6 ± 2.8; P &lt; 0.01) of the elderly patients. There was no change in collagen content of the mucosa. The total collagen concentration was increased in the elderly by 16%. Sex-related differences were not found, and data were combined for analysis. Conclusions Greater total collagen content was found in the submucosa and muscularis externa of the elderly human male and female colon. These changes may contribute to a possible loss of function with ageing."

Shifting dietary pattern and rapid increase in overweight/obesity among adults with persistent child undernutrition indicate that India is experiencing nutrition transition and double burden of malnutrition. Hence, the study explores the presence of and the factors associated with mother-child dyads of over- and undernutrition in India.The study uses National Family Health Survey 2015-16 data. The analytic sample consists of 28,817 weighted mother-child pairs where an overweight/obese mother is paired with an undernourished child. The nutritional status of children is defined according to WHO 2006 child growth standards as underweight (i.e., low weight-for-age), stunting (i.e., low height-for-age) and wasting (i.e., low weight-for-height). Maternal overweight/obesity (i.e., BMI ≥ 25 kg/m2) is defined using adult BMI criterion. Descriptive, bivariate, and adjusted multivariable logistic regression analysis are conducted.Of the overweight/obese mothers, 21.3%, 26.5%, and 14% have underweight, stunted, and wasted children respectively. In adjusted models, maternal short stature (aOR: 2.94, 95% CI: 2.30-3.75), age of child (aOR: 3.29, 95% CI: 2.76-3.92), and poorest wealth status (aOR: 2.01, 95% CI: 1.59-2.54) are significant predictors of overweight/obese mothers and stunted child pairs. Similarly, poor wealth status (aOR: 1.68, 95% CI:1.32-2.14), maternal stature (aOR: 2.70, 95% CI: 2.08-3.52), and child aged 2-5 years (aOR: 1.77, 95% CI:1.51-2.08) are also significantly associated with higher occurrence of overweight/obese mother and-underweight child pairs.Findings of the study are consistent with the phase of nutrition transition and double burden of malnutrition. The paper concludes with suggestions to improve the socioeconomic condition, more strategic nutrition specific investments and policy interventions to eliminate all forms of malnutrition for achieving SDGs."
https://openalex.org/W4283016320,"Deep tendon reflexes (DTR) are a prerequisite skill in clinical clerkships. However, many medical students are not confident in their technique and need to be effectively trained. We evaluated the effectiveness of a flipped classroom for teaching DTR skills. We recruited 83 fifth-year medical students who participated in a clinical clerkship at the Department of General Medicine, Chiba University Hospital, from November 2018 to July 2019. They were allocated to the flipped classroom technique (intervention group, n = 39) or the traditional technique instruction group (control group, n = 44). Before procedural teaching, while the intervention group learned about DTR by e-learning, the control group did so face-to-face. A 5-point Likert scale was used to evaluate self-confidence in DTR examination before and after the procedural teaching (1 = no confidence, 5 = confidence). We evaluated the mastery of techniques after procedural teaching using the Direct Observation of Procedural Skills (DOPS). Unpaired t-test was used to analyze the difference between the two groups on the 5-point Likert scale and DOPS. We assessed self-confidence in DTR examination before and after procedural teaching using a free description questionnaire in the two groups. Additionally, in the intervention group, focus group interviews (FGI) (7 groups, n = 39) were conducted to assess the effectiveness of the flipped classroom after procedural teaching. Pre-test self-confidence in the DTR examination was significantly higher in the intervention group than in the control group (2.8 vs. 2.3, P = 0.005). Post-test self-confidence in the DTR examination was not significantly different between the two groups (3.9 vs. 4.1, P = 0.31), and so was mastery (4.3 vs. 4.1, P = 0.68). The questionnaires before the procedural teaching revealed themes common to the two groups, including “lack of knowledge” and “lack of self-confidence.” Themes about prior learning, including “acquisition of knowledge” and “promoting understanding,” were specific in the intervention group. The FGI revealed themes including “application of knowledge,” “improvement in DTR technique,” and “increased self-confidence.” Based on these results, teaching DTR skills to medical students in flipped classrooms improves readiness for learning and increases self-confidence in performing the procedure at a point before procedural teaching."

Records of COVID-19 laboratory-confirmed positive cases within the medical laboratory service were routinely collected in the company's Occupational Health and Safety Information System (OHASIS). Surveillance data from the OHASIS system were extracted from 1 April 2020 to 31 March 2021. An epidemic curve was plotted and compared to that for the country, along with prevalence proportions and incidence rates. The odds of COVID-19 infection were categorised by job and compared to the US Occupational Risk Scores. A logistic regression model assessed the risk of COVID-19 infection per occupational group. A total of 2091 (26% of staff) COVID-19 positive cases were reported. The number of COVID-19 cases was higher in the first wave at 46% (967/2091) of cases, than in the second wave 40% (846/2091) of cases. There was no significant difference in COVID-19 prevalence between male and female employees. The job categories with the most increased risk were laboratory managers [AOR 3.2 (95%CI 1.9-5.1)] and laboratory support clerks [AOR 3.2 (95%CI 1.9-5.2)]. Our study confirms that some categories of medical laboratory staff are at increased risk for COVID-19; this is a complex interaction between workplace risk factors, community interaction, socioeconomic status, personal habits, and behaviour. Targeted interventions are recommended for high-risk groups. OHASIS has the potential to generate data for surveillance of health care workers and contribute towards a South African risk profile."

From a clinical perspective, the carbapenem-hydrolyzing class D β-lactamase subfamily present in Acinetobacter spp. is particularly concerning because of its ability to confer resistance to carbapenems. The kinetic profiles of class D β-lactamases exhibit variability in carbapenem hydrolysis, suggesting functional differences. To better understand the structure-function relationship between the carbapenem-hydrolyzing class D β-lactamase OXA-24/40 found in Acinetobacter baumannii and carbapenem substrates, we analyzed steady-state kinetics with the carbapenem antibiotics meropenem and ertapenem and determined the structures of complexes of OXA-24/40 bound to imipenem, meropenem, doripenem, and ertapenem, as well as the expanded-spectrum cephalosporin cefotaxime, using X-ray crystallography. We show that OXA-24/40 exhibits a preference for ertapenem compared with meropenem, imipenem, and doripenem, with an increase in catalytic efficiency of up to fourfold. We suggest that superposition of the nine OXA-24/40 complexes will better inform future inhibitor design efforts by providing insight into the complicated and varying ways in which carbapenems are selected and bound by class D β-lactamases."
https://openalex.org/W4282837911,"Extra-large stimulatory Gα (XLαs) is a large variant of G protein αs subunit (Gαs) that uses an alternative promoter and thus differs from Gαs at the first exon. XLαs activation by G protein-coupled receptors mediates cAMP generation, similarly to Gαs; however, Gαs and XLαs have been shown to have distinct cellular and physiological functions. For example, previous work suggests that XLαs can stimulate inositol phosphate production in renal proximal tubules and thereby regulate serum phosphate levels. In this study, we show that XLαs directly and specifically stimulates a specific isoform of phospholipase Cβ (PLCβ), PLCβ4, both in transfected cells and with purified protein components. We demonstrate that neither the ability of XLαs to activate cAMP generation nor the canonical G protein switch II regions are required for PLCβ stimulation. Furthermore, this activation is nucleotide independent but is inhibited by Gβγ, suggesting a mechanism of activation that relies on Gβγ subunit dissociation. Surprisingly, our results indicate that enhanced membrane targeting of XLαs relative to Gαs confers the ability to activate PLCβ4. We also show that PLCβ4 is required for isoproterenol-induced inositol phosphate accumulation in osteocyte-like Ocy454 cells. Taken together, we demonstrate a novel mechanism for activation of phosphoinositide turnover downstream of Gs-coupled receptors that may have a critical role in endocrine physiology."
https://openalex.org/W4282972103,"Purpose Higher levels of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D 25(OHD) are associated with better prognosis in breast and colorectal cancer. However, the evidence is still inconclusive for bladder cancer (BC). Herein, we investigated the diagnosis and prognosis roles of serum levels of 25(OHD) in suspected BC patients presented by hematuria. Methods This prospective cohort study involved suspected patients of BC presented with hematuria. Patients were evaluated by CT urogram, office cystoscopy and urine cytology with subsequent inpatient biopsy for positive findings. Baseline blood samples were collected for measurement of 25(OHD) by electrochemiluminescence binding assay at the time of diagnosis. Patients with non-muscle-invasive BC (NMIBC) underwent transurethral resection of bladder tumor (TURBT) and adjuvant intravesical chemotherapy or BCG instillation. Patients were followed up for their recurrence status during 10 to 24 months. Recurrence was defined as the first time of NMIBC pathological relapse during the follow up period. Results A total of 115 patients were included in the final analysis. Patients had proven pathological BC (64 with NMIBC, and 20 with muscle invasive) and 31 patients were considered as control group. Controls were those patients with BC-free workup (including cytology, cystoscopy, and upper tract imaging). BC group showed a lower level of 25(OHD) than control group 16.47±5.88 versus 28.99±3.19 ng/mL (p&lt;0.001). In addition, muscle invasive group also showed a lower level than NMIBC group 13.17±4.5 versus 17.49±5.04 ng/mL (P = 0.003). During the follow-up period of, tumor recurrence occurred in 16 (25%) of NMIBC patients. The baseline 25(OHD) were decreased in patients who experienced early recurrence; without being statistically significant (15.99 ± 5.17 vs. 18.38 ± 5.14 ng/mL; p = 0.08). 25(OHD) deficiency/insufficiency occurred in 5 (16.1%) and 64 (76.2%) in control and BC patients, respectively, (odds-ratios (OR): 2.13; 95% confidence intervals (CI), 1.52–2.99; P &lt; 0.0001). Conclusion Serum 25(OHD) is significantly decreased in BC patients especially those with tumor muscle invasive group. However, the baseline serum 25(OHD) does not predict the recurrence in the NMIBC patients."
https://openalex.org/W4282972268,"Background Sickle cell disease (SCD) may cause several impacts to patients and the whole society. About 4% of the population has the sickle cell trait in Brazil, and 60,000 to 100,000 have SCD. However, despite recognizing the significant burden of disease, little is known about SCD costs. Objective To estimate SCD societal costs based on disease burden modelling, under Brazilian societal perspective. Methods A disease burden model was built considering the societal perspective and a one-year time horizon, including direct medical and indirect costs (morbidity and mortality). The sum of life lost and disability years was considered to estimate disability-adjusted life years (DALYs). Data from a public database (DATASUS) and the prevalence obtained from literature or medical experts were used to define complications prevalence and duration. Costs were defined using data from the Brazilian public healthcare system table of procedures and medications (SIGTAP) and the human capital method. Results Annual SCD cost was 413,639,180 USD. Indirect cost accounted for the majority of burden (70.1% of the total; 290,158,365 USD vs 123,480,816 USD). Standard of care and chronic complications were the main source of direct costs among adults, while acute conditions were the main source among children. Vaso-occlusive crisis represented the complication with the highest total cost per year in both populations, 11,400,410 USD among adults and 11,510,960 USD among children. Conclusions SCD management may impose an important economic burden on Brazilian society that may reach more than 400 million USD per year."
https://openalex.org/W4282984039,"This particular study investigated the possibility of modelling the exchange rate volatility of the USD/LKR currency pair and analysed whether macroeconomic factors influence the exchange rate. To model the exchange rate volatility, a combination of Autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) and generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity (GARCH) family models were used. The ARDL model was utilized to explore the presence of dynamic short-run and long-run relationships between the exchange rate and macroeconomic variables. The ARDL model empirical findings inferred that a long-run relationship does not exist between any of the examined macroeconomic variables and the exchange rate. In contrast, a short-run relationship exists between exchange rate lag one, exchange rate lag two, inflation, and merchandising trade balance. Thereby, as per the findings improving the merchandising trade balance and minimising inflation would minimise volatility in the exchange rate. All stakeholders who are exposed to foreign exchange volatility including policymakers, importers, exporters, and financial institutions can benefit from this study’s findings. This research focused on the most recent economic phenomena of Sri Lanka and used Gross official reserve as a variable that was rarely used in existing literature on Sri Lankan exchange rate."
https://openalex.org/W4283011493,"Bergmann's and Allen's rules were defined to describe macroecological patterns across latitudinal gradients. Bergmann observed a positive association between body size and latitude for endothermic species while Allen described shorter appendages as latitude increases. Almost two centuries later, there is still ongoing discussion about these patterns. Temperature, the common variable in these two rules, varies predictably across both latitude and elevation. Although these rules have been assessed extensively in mammals across latitude, particularly in regions with strong seasonality, studies on tropical montane mammals are scarce. We here test for these patterns and assess the variation of several other locomotory, diet-associated, body condition, and thermoregulatory traits across elevation in the Mountain Treeshrew (Tupaia montana) on tropical mountains in Borneo. Based on morphological measurements from both the field and scientific collections, we found a complex pattern: Bergmann's rule was not supported in our tropical mountain system, since skull length, body size, and weight decreased from the lowest elevations (<1000 m) to middle elevations (2000-2500 m), and then increased from middle elevations to highest elevations. Allen's rule was supported for relative tail length, which decreased with elevation, but not for ear and hindfoot length, with the former remaining constant and the latter increasing with elevation. This evidence together with changes in presumed diet-related traits (rostrum length, zygomatic breadth and upper tooth row length) along elevation suggest that selective pressures other than temperature, are playing a more important role shaping the morphological variation across the distribution of the Mountain Treeshrew. Diet, food acquisition, predation pressure, and/or intra- and inter-specific competition, are some of the potential factors driving the phenotypic variation of this study system. The lack of variation in body condition might suggest local adaptation of this species across its elevational range, perhaps due to generalist foraging strategies. Finally, a highly significant temporal effect was detected in several traits but not in others, representing the first phenotypic variation temporal trends described on treeshrews."

We compare the predictive power of LSTM-HMM with other dynamic forecast systems within different time windows, which involves the Hidden Markov Model (HMM), Gaussian Mixture Model-Hidden Markov Model (GMM-HMM) and LSTM-HMM with an input of monthly Consumer Price Index (CPI) or quarterly CPI within 4-year, 6-year, 8-year and 10-year time window. These forecasting models employed in our empirical analysis share the basic HMM structure but differ in the generation of observable CPI fluctuation states. Our forecasting results suggest that (1) among all the models, LSTM-HMM generally performs better than the other models; (2) the model performance can be improved when model input transforms from quarterly to monthly; (3) among all the time windows, models within 10-year time window have better overall performance; (4) within 10-year time window, the LSTM-HMM, with either quarterly or monthly input, has the best accuracy and consistency."

This study aimed to examine the trends in PPI use in Japan, along with the changes in histamine H 2 receptor antagonist (H 2 RA) use, disease rate of reflux esophagitis, and the prevalence of upper gastrointestinal symptoms. We analyzed 217,712 healthy subjects (127,607 men and 90,105 women; 51.4 ± 9.7 years old) participating in the health check program from 2010 to 2019. Various upper gastrointestinal symptoms were evaluated using the frequency scale for the symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux disease (FSSG) questionnaire. Reflux esophagitis was diagnosed by esophageal erosion using the Los Angeles classification grades A, B, C, and D. From 2010 to 2019, the percentage of PPI users increased markedly from approximately 1.8% to 5.3%, whereas that of H 2 RA users decreased gradually from approximately 2.5% to 1.9%. The use of all classical types of PPIs (omeprazole, lansoprazole, rabeprazole, and esomerazole) and a new type of PPI, a potassium-competitive acid blocker (vonoprazan), greatly increased during the 10 years. An upward trend in the prevalence of reflux esophagitis was observed from 2010 to 2015, but not from 2016 to 2019, indicating that the monotonic rising prevalence of reflux disease stopped in the middle of the 2010s in Japan. In contrast, various upper gastrointestinal symptoms significantly improved between 2010 and 2019. All 12 FSSG symptoms of PPI users were significantly worse than those of non-PPI users, suggesting that PPIs still cannot completely control upper gastrointestinal symptoms. In conclusion, this study revealed a significant increase in PPI use and a slight decrease in H 2 RA use from 2010 to 2019. Despite a plateau in the prevalence of reflux esophagitis and considerable improvement in various upper gastrointestinal symptoms, PPI use has continued to increase in Japan."
https://openalex.org/W4283067629,"Duck Tembusu virus (TMUV) is a serious avian pathogen causing a decline in egg production, but the mechanism of the virus that breaks through the innate immune system is poorly understood. Here, we show that TMUV inhibits poly(I:C)-induced interferon (IFN) production. Because poly(I:C) transfection can specifically activate the MDA5 pathway in duck primary cells, we found that infection with TMUV can specifically target MDA5 and lead to its degradation. MDA5 downregulation could be blocked by the autophagy inhibitor 3-methyladenine (3-MA) but not a proteasome inhibitor, strongly implicating MDA5 degradation as an autophagy-related degradation pathway. Pretreatment with 3-MA enhanced the expression of MDA5 and inhibited TMUV replication. To screen TMUV proteins that degraded MDA5, the TMUV replicon and MDA5-Flag were cotransfected into cells, and the western blot analysis showed that nonstructural 2B (NS2B) can degrade MDA5 in a dose-dependent manner. Dual-luciferase assays indicate that NS2B alone inhibits MDA5- or poly(I:C)-mediated IFN production. NS2B binds MDA5 in the presence of 3-MA. The deletion of the amino acids of NS2B from residues 51 to 92 (hydrophilic area) restored the expression of MDA5 and relieved the MDA5-mediated IFNβ production inhibition by NS2B, indicating that the hydrophilic area of NS2B is important for its interaction with host innate immunity."
https://openalex.org/W4283068154,"The question of whether behavioral traits are heritable is under debate. An obstacle in demonstrating transgenerational inheritance in mammals originates from the maternal environment's effect on offspring phenotype. Here, we used in ovo embryonic heat conditioning (EHC) of first-generation chicks, demonstrating heredity of both heat and immunological resilience, confirmed by a reduced fibril response in their untreated offspring to either heat or LPS challenge. Concordantly, transcriptome analysis confirmed that EHC induces changes in gene expression in the anterior preoptic hypothalamus (APH) that contribute to these phenotypes in the offspring. To study the association between epigenetic mechanisms and trait heritability, DNA-methylation patterns in the APH of offspring of control versus EHC fathers were evaluated. Genome-wide analysis revealed thousands of differentially methylated sites (DMSs), which were highly enriched in enhancers and CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) sites. Overlap analysis revealed 110 differentially expressed genes that were associated with altered methylation, predominantly on enhancers. Gene-ontology analysis shows pathways associated with immune response, chaperone-mediated protein folding, and stress response. For the proof of concept, we focused on HSP25 and SOCS3, modulators of heat and immune responses, respectively. Chromosome conformational capture (3C) assay identified interactions between their promoters and methylated enhancers, with the strongest frequency on CTCF binding sites. Furthermore, gene expression corresponded with the differential methylation patterns, and presented increased CTCF binding in both hyper- and hypomethylated DMSs. Collectively, we demonstrate that EHC induces transgenerational thermal and immunological resilience traits. We propose that one of the mechanisms underlying inheritance depends on three-dimensional (3D) chromatin reorganization."
https://openalex.org/W4282961906,"Simple feature detectors in the visual system, such as edge-detectors, are likely to underlie even the most complex visual processing, so understanding the limits of these systems is crucial for a fuller understanding of visual processing. We investigated the ability of bumblebees ( Bombus terrestris ) to discriminate between differently angled edges. In a multiple-choice, “meadow-like” scenario, bumblebees successfully discriminated between angled bars with 7° differences, significantly exceeding the previously reported performance of eastern honeybees ( Apis cerana , limit: 15°). Neither the rate at which bees learned, nor their final discrimination performance were affected by the angular orientation of the training bars, indicating a uniform performance across the visual field. Previous work has found that, in dual-choice tests, eastern honeybees cannot reliably discriminate between angles with less than 25° difference, suggesting that performance in discrimination tasks is affected by the training regime, and doesn’t simply reflect the perceptual limitations of the visual system. We used high resolution LCD monitors to investigate bumblebees’ angular resolution in a dual-choice experiment. Bumblebees could still discriminate 7° angle differences under such conditions (exceeding the previously reported limit for Apis mellifera , of 10°, as well as that of A . cerana ). Bees eventually reached similar levels of accuracy in the dual-choice experiment as they did under multiple-choice conditions but required longer learning periods. Bumblebees show impressive abilities to discriminate between angled edges, performing better than two previously tested species of honeybee. This high performance may, in turn, support complex visual processing in the bumblebee brain."

We investigated the metabolic phenotype of the VDR-null (VDRKO) mouse at early and middle age. All offspring of heterozygote VDRKO breeding-pairs were fed 'rescue diet' from weaning to normalize calcium and phosphate levels in VDRKO and to avoid confounding by different diets. Glucose tolerance testing was performed at 7 and 24 weeks of age. Insulin tolerance testing, glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, body-composition studies and islet isolation were performed at 25-27 weeks. Glucose-stimulated insulin secretion was tested in isolated islets. VDRKO mice had reduced bone density, subcutaneous fat mass and muscle weights compared to WT mice. Despite reduced fat mass, glucose tolerance did not differ significantly. Male but not female VDRKO had improved insulin sensitivity. Global loss of VDR has significant effects on organs involved in energy metabolism and glucose homeostasis. In the setting of decreased fat mass, a clear effect on glucose tolerance was not present."

First, to longitudinally investigate the psychological distress (depression, anxiety, and stress levels) taking in consideration PT and ER strategies in 3 different moments: during the first lockdown period (April/20), at the first deconfinement (May/20) and 1-month after the first deconfinement (Jun/20)-Experiment I. Second, to cross-sectionally evaluate the impact of the pandemic in psychological distress and the correlates with PT and ER 6-months after the first deconfinement November/20 to February/21 -Experiment II. A total of 722 volunteers (Experiment I = 180; Experiment II = 542) aged 18 years or older participated in this online survey. The findings from Experiment I show that psychological distress decreased after the lockdown period, however, neuroticism traits predicted higher levels of depression, anxiety and stress symptoms, while difficulties in ER strategies were identified as a risk factor for depression and stress. For experiment II, neuroticism traits and being infected with COVID-19 were associated to higher levels of symptomatology, while unemployment and the use of emotional suppression strategies to cope with emotional situations were associated to depressive and anxiety symptoms. Although the psychological impact of the COVID-19 outbreak decreased over time in our sample, the current findings suggest that difficulties in emotional regulation and high levels of neuroticism traits might be potential risk factors for psychiatric symptomatology during the COVID-19 pandemic. Thus, people with difficulties in ER and neuroticism traits would benefit from psychological interventions that provide personality-appropriate support and promote emotion regulation skills during stressful events, such as the case of the global pandemic."

We evaluated a multifaceted intervention for improving TB treatment initiation among patients diagnosed with TB using Xpert® MTB/RIF testing in Uganda.This was a pre-post interventional study at one tertiary referral hospital. The intervention was informed by the COM-B model and included; i) medical education sessions to improve healthcare worker knowledge about the magnitude and consequences of pretreatment loss to follow-up; ii) modified laboratory request forms to improve recording of patient contact information; and iii) re-designed workflow processes to improve timeliness of sputum testing and results dissemination. TB diagnostic process and outcome data were collected and compared from the period before (June to August 2019) and after (October to December 2019) intervention initiation.In September 2019, four CME sessions were held at the hospital and were attended by 58 healthcare workers. During the study period, 1242 patients were evaluated by Xpert® MTB/RIF testing at the hospital (679 pre and 557 post intervention). Median turnaround time for sputum test results improved from 12 hours (IQR 4-46) in the pre-intervention period to 4 hours (IQR 3-6) in the post-intervention period. The proportion of patients started on treatment within two weeks of diagnosis improved from 59% (40/68) to 89% (49/55) (difference 30%, 95% CI 14%-43%, p<0.01) while the proportion of patients receiving a same-day diagnosis increased from 7.4% (5/68) to 25% (14/55) (difference 17.6%, 95% CI 3.9%-32.7%, p<0.01).The multifaceted intervention was feasible and resulted in a higher proportion of patients initiating TB treatment within two weeks of diagnosis."
