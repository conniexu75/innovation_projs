https://openalex.org/W1992669445,"The complexity of tissue- and day time-specific regulation of thousands of clock-controlled genes (CCGs) suggests that many regulatory mechanisms contribute to the transcriptional output of the circadian clock. We aim to predict these mechanisms using a large scale promoter analysis of CCGs.Our study is based on a meta-analysis of DNA-array data from rodent tissues. We searched in the promoter regions of 2065 CCGs for highly overrepresented transcription factor binding sites. In order to compensate the relatively high GC-content of CCG promoters, a novel background model to avoid a bias towards GC-rich motifs was employed. We found that many of the transcription factors with overrepresented binding sites in CCG promoters exhibit themselves circadian rhythms. Among the predicted factors are known regulators such as CLOCKratioBMAL1, DBP, HLF, E4BP4, CREB, RORalpha and the recently described regulators HSF1, STAT3, SP1 and HNF-4alpha. As additional promising candidates of circadian transcriptional regulators PAX-4, C/EBP, EVI-1, IRF, E2F, AP-1, HIF-1 and NF-Y were identified. Moreover, GC-rich motifs (SP1, EGR, ZF5, AP-2, WT1, NRF-1) and AT-rich motifs (MEF-2, HMGIY, HNF-1, OCT-1) are significantly overrepresented in promoter regions of CCGs. Putative tissue-specific binding sites such as HNF-3 for liver, NKX2.5 for heart or Myogenin for skeletal muscle were found. The regulation of the erythropoietin (Epo) gene was analysed, which exhibits many binding sites for circadian regulators. We provide experimental evidence for its circadian regulated expression in the adult murine kidney. Basing on a comprehensive literature search we integrate our predictions into a regulatory network of core clock and clock-controlled genes. Our large scale analysis of the CCG promoters reveals the complexity and extensiveness of the circadian regulation in mammals. Results of this study point to connections of the circadian clock to other functional systems including metabolism, endocrine regulation and pharmacokinetics."
https://openalex.org/W2090282670,"Tripartite motif (TRIM) proteins constitute a family of proteins that share a conserved tripartite architecture. The recent discovery of the anti-HIV activity of TRIM5alpha in primate cells has stimulated much interest in the potential role of TRIM proteins in antiviral activities and innate immunity.To test if TRIM genes are up-regulated during antiviral immune responses, we performed a systematic analysis of TRIM gene expression in human primary lymphocytes and monocyte-derived macrophages in response to interferons (IFNs, type I and II) or following FcgammaR-mediated activation of macrophages. We found that 27 of the 72 human TRIM genes are sensitive to IFN. Our analysis identifies 9 additional TRIM genes that are up-regulated by IFNs, among which only 3 have previously been found to display an antiviral activity. Also, we found 2 TRIM proteins, TRIM9 and 54, to be specifically up-regulated in FcgammaR-activated macrophages.Our results present the first comprehensive TRIM gene expression analysis in primary human immune cells, and suggest the involvement of additional TRIM proteins in regulating host antiviral activities."
https://openalex.org/W2046345409,"In functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies, a cortical region in the right temporo-parietal junction (RTPJ) is recruited when participants read stories about people's thoughts (‘Theory of Mind’). Both fMRI and lesion studies suggest that a region near the RTPJ is associated with attentional reorienting in response to an unexpected stimulus. Do Theory of Mind and attentional reorienting recruit a single population of neurons, or are there two neighboring but distinct neural populations in the RTPJ? One recent study compared these activations, and found evidence consistent with a single common region. However, the apparent overlap may have been due to the low resolution of the previous technique. We tested this hypothesis using a high-resolution protocol, within-subjects analyses, and more powerful statistical methods. Strict conjunction analyses revealed that the area of overlap was small and on the periphery of each activation. In addition, a bootstrap analysis identified a reliable 6–10 mm spatial displacement between the peak activations of the two tasks; the same magnitude and direction of displacement was observed in within-subjects comparisons. In all, these results suggest that there are neighboring but distinct regions within the RTPJ implicated in Theory of Mind and orienting attention."
https://openalex.org/W2082641730,"Background Cancer associated with smoking and drinking remains a serious health problem worldwide. The survival of patients is very poor due to the lack of effective early biomarkers. FOXM1 overexpression is linked to the majority of human cancers but its mechanism remains unclear in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). Methodology/Principal Findings FOXM1 mRNA and protein expressions were investigated in four independent cohorts (total 75 patients) consisting of normal, premalignant and HNSCC tissues and cells using quantitative PCR (qPCR), expression microarray, immunohistochemistry and immunocytochemistry. Effect of putative oral carcinogens on FOXM1 transcriptional activity was dose-dependently assayed and confirmed using a FOXM1-specific luciferase reporter system, qPCR, immunoblotting and short-hairpin RNA interference. Genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array was used to ‘trace’ the genomic instability signature pattern in 8 clonal lines of FOXM1-induced malignant human oral keratinocytes. Furthermore, acute FOXM1 upregulation in primary oral keratinocytes directly induced genomic instability. We have shown for the first time that overexpression of FOXM1 precedes HNSCC malignancy. Screening putative carcinogens in human oral keratinocytes surprisingly showed that nicotine, which is not perceived to be a human carcinogen, directly induced FOXM1 mRNA, protein stabilisation and transcriptional activity at concentrations relevant to tobacco chewers. Importantly, nicotine also augmented FOXM1-induced transformation of human oral keratinocytes. A centrosomal protein CEP55 and a DNA helicase/putative stem cell marker HELLS, both located within a consensus loci (10q23), were found to be novel targets of FOXM1 and their expression correlated tightly with HNSCC progression. Conclusions/Significance This study cautions the potential co-carcinogenic effect of nicotine in tobacco replacement therapies. We hypothesise that aberrant upregulation of FOXM1 may be inducing genomic instability through a program of malignant transformation involving the activation of CEP55 and HELLS which may facilitate aberrant mitosis and epigenetic modifications. Our finding that FOXM1 is upregulated early during oral cancer progression renders FOXM1 an attractive diagnostic biomarker for early cancer detection and its candidate mechanistic targets, CEP55 and HELLS, as indicators of malignant conversion and progression."
https://openalex.org/W2161849052,"Aggregated fibrillary microtubule-associated protein tau is the major component of neurofibrillary tangles in Alzheimer's disease. The exact molecular mechanism of tau aggregation is unknown. Microglial cell activation and migration toward amyloid-beta plaques precede the appearance of dysmorphic neurites and formation of neurofibrillary tangles. Here, we analyzed the accumulation of tau at a distance range of expected spontaneous aggregation by fluorescence lifetime-based Förster resonance energy transfer in cultured primary murine neurons cotransfected with the human tau gene tagged to the green fluorescent protein variants Citrine (tau-Citrine) and Cerulean (tau-Cerulean). No spontaneous accumulation of cotransfected tau-Citrine and tau-Cerulean was detected in untreated neurons. Coculture of neurons with activated microglia induced aggregation of tau in neurites. Treatment of neurons with tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) stimulated reactive oxygen species generation and resulted in the accumulation of tau-Citrine and tau-Cerulean in neurites, which was inhibited by neutralization of TNF and the free radical inhibitor 6-hydroxy-2,5,7,8-tetramethylchromane-2-carboxylic acid (Trolox). These data demonstrate that activated microglia and the microglial-derived proinflammatory cytokine TNF can induce accumulation of the aggregation-prone tau molecules in neurites via reactive oxygen species."
https://openalex.org/W2081010527,"Highly pathogenic avian influenza virus A/H5N1 was first officially reported in Africa in early 2006. Since the first outbreak in Nigeria, this virus spread rapidly to other African countries. From its emergence to early 2008, 11 African countries experienced A/H5N1 outbreaks in poultry and human cases were also reported in three of these countries. At present, little is known of the epidemiology and molecular evolution of A/H5N1 viruses in Africa. We have generated 494 full gene sequences from 67 African isolates and applied molecular analysis tools to a total of 1,152 A/H5N1 sequences obtained from viruses isolated in Africa, Europe and the Middle East between 2006 and early 2008. Detailed phylogenetic analyses of the 8 gene viral segments confirmed that 3 distinct sublineages were introduced, which have persisted and spread across the continent over this 2-year period. Additionally, our molecular epidemiological studies highlighted the association between genetic clustering and area of origin in a majority of cases. Molecular signatures unique to strains isolated in selected areas also gave us a clearer picture of the spread of A/H5N1 viruses across the continent. Mutations described as typical of human influenza viruses in the genes coding for internal proteins or associated with host adaptation and increased resistance to antiviral drugs have also been detected in the genes coding for transmembrane proteins. These findings raise concern for the possible human health risk presented by viruses with these genetic properties and highlight the need for increased efforts to monitor the evolution of A/H5N1 viruses across the African continent. They further stress how imperative it is to implement sustainable control strategies to improve animal and public health at a global level."
https://openalex.org/W2161356885,The attenuation of the beta cortical oscillations during action observation has been interpreted as evidence of a mirror neuron system (MNS) in humans. Here we investigated the modulation of beta cortical oscillations with the viewpoint of an observed action. We asked subjects to observe videos of an actor making a variety of arm movements. We show that when subjects were observing arm movements there was a significant modulation of beta oscillations overlying left and right sensorimotor cortices. This pattern of attenuation was driven by the side of the screen on which the observed movement occurred and not by the hand that was observed moving. These results are discussed in terms of the firing patterns of mirror neurons in F5 which have been reported to have similar properties.
https://openalex.org/W2159318997,"We have determined the structure of the sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPase (SERCA) in an E2.P(i)-like form stabilized as a complex with MgF(4)(2-), an ATP analog, adenosine 5'-(beta,gamma-methylene)triphosphate (AMPPCP), and cyclopiazonic acid (CPA). The structure determined at 2.5A resolution leads to a significantly revised model of CPA binding when compared with earlier reports. It shows that a divalent metal ion is required for CPA binding through coordination of the tetramic acid moiety at a characteristic kink of the M1 helix found in all P-type ATPase structures, which is expected to be part of the cytoplasmic cation access pathway. Our model is consistent with the biochemical data on CPA function and provides new measures in structure-based drug design targeting Ca(2+)-ATPases, e.g. from pathogens. We also present an extended structural basis of ATP modulation pinpointing key residues at or near the ATP binding site. A structural comparison to the Na(+),K(+)-ATPase reveals that the Phe(93) side chain occupies the equivalent binding pocket of the CPA site in SERCA, suggesting an important role of this residue in stabilization of the potassium-occluded E2 state of Na(+),K(+)-ATPase."
https://openalex.org/W2049140820,"The pathogenic clinical strain NCTC11168 was the first Campylobacter jejuni strain to be sequenced and has been a widely used laboratory model for studying C. jejuni pathogenesis. However, continuous passaging of C. jejuni NCTC11168 has been shown to dramatically affect its colonisation potential. Glycan array analysis was performed on C. jejuni NCTC11168 using the frequently passaged, non-colonising, genome sequenced (11168-GS) and the infrequently passaged, original, virulent (11168-O) isolates grown or maintained under various conditions. Glycan structures recognised and bound by C. jejuni included terminal mannose, N-acetylneuraminic acid, galactose and fucose. Significantly, it was found that only when challenged with normal oxygen at room temperature did 11168-O consistently bind to sialic acid or terminal mannose structures, while 11168-GS bound these structures regardless of growth/maintenance conditions. Further, binding of un-capped galactose and fucosylated structures was significantly reduced when C. jejuni was maintained at 25°C under atmospheric oxygen conditions. These binding differences identified through glycan array analysis were confirmed by the ability of specific lectins to competitively inhibit the adherence of C. jejuni to a Caco-2 intestinal cell line. Our data suggests that the binding of mannose and/or N-acetylneuraminic acid may provide the initial interactions important for colonisation following environmental exposure."
https://openalex.org/W2166223568,"Duchenne-Meryon muscular dystrophy (DMD) is the most common and lethal genetic muscle disease. Ameliorating muscle necrosis, inflammation, and fibrosis represents an important therapeutic approach for DMD. Imatinib, an antineoplastic agent, demonstrated antiinflammatory and antifibrotic effects in liver, kidney, lung, and skin of various animal models. This study tested antiinflammatory and antifibrotic effects of imatinib in mdx mice, a DMD mouse model. We treated mdx mice with intraperitoneal injections of imatinib at the peak of limb muscle inflammation and the onset of diaphragm fibrosis. Controls received PBS vehicle or were left untreated. Muscle necrosis, inflammation, fibrosis, and function were evaluated by measuring serum CK activity, endomysial CD45 immunoreactive inflammation area, endomysial collagen III deposition, and hind limb grip strength. Phosphorylation of the tyrosine kinase targets of imatinib was assessed by Western blot in diaphragm tissue and in primary cultures of peritoneal macrophages and skeletal muscle fibroblasts. Imatinib markedly reduced muscle necrosis, inflammation, and fibrosis, and significantly improved hind limb grip strength in mdx mice. Reduced clinical disease was accompanied by inhibition of c-abl and PDGFR phosphorylation and suppression of TNF-α and IL-β expression. Imatinib therapy for DMD may hold promise for ameliorating muscle necrosis, inflammation, and fibrosis by inhibiting c-abl and PDGFR signaling pathways and downstream inflammatory cytokine and fibrotic gene expression.— Huang, P., Zhao, X.

https://openalex.org/W2132072236,"Hypoxia is well known to limit curability of tumors by ionizing radiation. Here, we show that hypoxia treatment of tumor cells causes coexpression of heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70) and phosphatidylserine (PS) on the cell surface. Colocalization of Hsp70 and PS, as determined by confocal microscopy, also occurs when exogenous FITC-labeled Hsp70 protein is added to normoxic and hypoxic tumor cells. Moreover, the interaction of Hsp70 with PS was demonstrated in artificial unilamellar phosphatidylcholine/ phosphatidylserine (PC/PS) liposomes at the physiological ratio of 8/2. Indeed, the Hsp70-liposome interaction gradually increased with elevating PS molar ratios (8/2 > or = 7/3 < 5/5 < 4/6 < 3/7 < 2/8). In contrast, only a weak Hsp70 interaction was detected in phosphatidylcholine/phosphatidylglycerol (PC/PG) liposomes, thus demonstrating that the interaction was not a charge-related effect. The interaction of Hsp70 with surface PS significantly reduces clonogenic cell survival in normoxic (EC(50) of Hsp70=85 microg/ml) and hypoxic (EC(50) of Hsp70=55 microg/ml) tumor cells. The radiation-induced tumor cell killing was significantly enhanced by the addition of Hsp70 protein (50 microg/ml). Since apoptosis was not significantly enhanced in normoxic and hypoxic tumor cells by the addition of Hsp70, we hypothesize that the Hsp70 protein-induced reduction in clonogenic cell survival might be through necrosis rather than apoptosis."
https://openalex.org/W2074228615,"Protrudin is a protein that contains a Rab11-binding domain and a FYVE (lipid-binding) domain and that functions to promote neurite formation through interaction with the GDP-bound form of Rab11. Protrudin also contains a short sequence motif designated FFAT (two phenylalanines in an acidic tract), which in other proteins has been shown to mediate binding to vesicle-associated membrane protein-associated protein (VAP). We now show that protrudin associates and colocalizes with VAP-A, an isoform of VAP expressed in the endoplasmic reticulum. Both the interaction between protrudin and VAP-A as well as the induction of process formation by protrudin were markedly inhibited by mutation of the FFAT motif. Furthermore, depletion of VAP-A by RNA interference resulted in mislocalization of protrudin as well as in inhibition of neurite outgrowth induced by nerve growth factor in rat pheochromocytoma PC12 cells. These defects resulting from depletion of endogenous rat VAP-A in PC12 cells were corrected by forced expression of (RNA interference-resistant) human VAP-A but not by VAP-A mutants that have lost the ability to interact with protrudin. These results suggest that VAP-A is an important regulator both of the subcellular localization of protrudin and of its ability to stimulate neurite outgrowth.

These results suggest that VAP-A is an important regulator both of the subcellular localization of protrudin and of its ability to stimulate neurite outgrowth. The molecular mechanisms that underlie neurite formation include both cytoskeletal remodeling and membrane trafficking. Membrane components are transported in a directional manner within the cell by a membrane recycling system, resulting in expansion of the surface area of the neurite. The small GTPase Rab11 regulates membrane recycling and constitutive exocytosis (1Zerial M. McBride H. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 107-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (2730) Google Scholar), and it is thought to contribute to neurite formation through regulation of directional membrane transport. We have recently identified protrudin as a key regulator of Rab11-dependent membrane trafficking during neurite extension. Protrudin interacts with FKBP38 (also known as FKBP8) (2Shirane M. Nakayama K.I. Science. 2006; 314: 818-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar), which is a member of the immunophilin family of proteins that bind the immunosuppressant drug FK506 (3Barik S. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2006; 63: 2889-2900Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). FKBPs are multifunctional proteins that regulate the folding or export of other proteins as a result of their peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans-isomerase activity (4Hamilton G.S. Steiner J.P. J. Med. Chem. 1998; 41: 5119-5143Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Protrudin was found to interact with FKBP38, but not with other FKBP proteins such as FKBP12 or FKBP52 (5Shirane M. Ogawa M. Motoyama J. Nakayama K.I. Genes Cells. 2008; 13: 635-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Protrudin is hyperphosphorylated in Fkbp38-/- mice, which manifest abnormal extension of nerve fibers (5Shirane M. Ogawa M. Motoyama J. Nakayama K.I. Genes Cells. 2008; 13: 635-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Protrudin contains a Rab11-binding domain (RBD11), two transmembrane domains (TM1 and TM2), 2The abbreviations used are: TM, transmembrane domain; AD-HSP, autosomal dominant hereditary spastic paraplegia; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; NGF, nerve growth factor; VAP, vesicle-associated membrane protein-associated protein; shRNA, short hairpin RNA; MS/MS, tandem mass spectrometry; GST, glutathione S-transferase; HA, hemagglutinin epitope; PDI, protein-disulfide isomerase; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; MSP, major sperm protein. an FFAT (two phenylalanines in an acidic tract) motif (6Loewen C.J. Roy A. Levine T.P. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 2025-2035Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar), a coiled-coil domain, and a FYVE domain (7Gillooly D.J. Simonsen A. Stenmark H. Biochem. J. 2001; 355: 249-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). These structural characteristics suggested that protrudin might function in membrane trafficking, particularly in membrane recycling. The gene encoding ZFYVE27 (a synonym of human protrudin) was recently found to be mutated in a German family with an autosomal dominant form of hereditary spastic paraplegia (AD-HSP), which is characterized by selective degeneration of axons (8Mannan A.U. Krawen P. Sauter S.M. Boehm J. Chronowska A. Paulus W. Neesen J. Engel W. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2006; 79: 351-357Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The phenotype of the affected individuals is similar to that of patients with AD-HSP caused by mutation of spastin, a protein implicated in neuronal vesicular trafficking (9Salinas S. Carazo-Salas R.E. Proukakis C. Schiavo G. Warner T.T. J. Neurosci. Res. 2007; 85: 2778-2782Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), and protrudin was shown to interact with spastin (8Mannan A.U.

These findings support the notion that protrudin plays a key role in Rab11-mediated directional membrane transport during neurite formation. The subcellular localization of protrudin is dynamic. Whereas it is localized to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) under basal conditions, nerve growth factor (NGF) triggers the translocation of protrudin from the ER, via recycling endosomes, to the tip of membrane protrusions in neuronal cells. Given that the FFAT motif is thought to serve as an ER targeting signal (6Loewen C.J. Roy A. Levine T.P. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 2025-2035Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar), this motif might be expected to contribute both to the localization of protrudin to the ER and to the regulation of neurite formation by this protein. The FFAT motif (consensus amino acid sequence of EFFDAXE, where X is any amino acid) is present in several lipid-binding proteins that are implicated in the transfer of lipids between the ER and other organelles such as the Golgi apparatus (10Hanada K. Kumagai K. Yasuda S. Miura Y. Kawano M. Fukasawa M. Nishijima M. Nature. 2003; 426: 803-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (832) Google Scholar, 11Kawano M. Kumagai K. Nishijima M. Hanada K. J. Biol.

Vesicle-associated membrane protein-associated protein (VAP) interacts with these lipid-binding proteins through their FFAT motifs (6Loewen C.J. Roy A. Levine T.P.

VAP-A and VAP-B share ∼60% amino acid sequence identity, form homo- or heterodimers, and are expressed in many tissues (14Nishimura Y. Hayashi M. Inada H. Tanaka T. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Kandel E.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Physiol. 2000; 279: C877-C890Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We have now identified VAP-A and VAP-B as proteins that interact with protrudin. Protrudin preferentially interacts with VAP-A via its FFAT motif, and this motif was found to be required for the protrudin-dependent formation of membrane protrusions in HeLa cells. In addition, depletion of VAP-A by RNA interference resulted in inhibition of NGF-induced neurite outgrowth in the PC12 rat pheochromocytoma cell line. This inhibition of neurite outgrowth was reversed by expression of human VAP-A but not by that of VAP-A mutants that have lost the ability to bind to protrudin. These results suggest that interaction of protrudin with VAP-A is important both for its ER retention and for its ability to stimulate neurite formation. Construction of Plasmids—Construction of vectors encoding human protrudin and FKBP52 was described previously (2Shirane M. Nakayama K.I. Science. 2006; 314: 818-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 21Shirane M. Nakayama K.I. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 28-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). Complementary DNAs encoding mutants of protrudin were generated by the PCR with Prime Star polymerase (Takara, Ohtsu, Japan); those encoding VAP-A or VAP-B were generated by PCR from a human kidney cDNA library; and that encoding RAMP4 was generated by PCR from a mouse thyroid cDNA library. The VAP or RAMP4 cDNAs were subcloned into the pEF-BOS-2× HA or pEF-BOS-2× Myc vectors (kindly provided by Shigekazu Nagata, Kyoto University, Japan) or into pGEX-6P (Amersham Biosciences). DNA fragments encoding stem-loop-type short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) specific for rat VAP mRNAs (VAP-A-shRNA 1, 5′-GGTAGCACATTCGGATAAACC-3′; VAP-A-shRNA 2, 5′-GCCGTGTCCTTCAGAGATAAT-3′; VAP-A-shRNA 3, 5′-GGATTCTTTCTAGGGAAATTC-3′; VAP-B-shRNA 1, 5′-GGGTCATTATAGGGAAGATCG-3′; VAP-B-shRNA 2, 5′-GGTGGTGCTGTTCTTTATTGT-3′; VAP-B-shRNA 3, 5′-GCCCGACACTTCCGATATGGA-3′); or human VAP-B mRNA (5′-GGGAGGAGAACAAGCAGTTCA-3′) were synthesized, attached to the U6 promoter, and subcloned into the vector pIRES-Venus-B (Venus cDNA was kindly provided by Atsushi Miyawaki, RIKEN, Japan), which contains an internal ribosome entry site and encodes the reporter protein Venus. Protein Identification by Liquid Chromatography-MS/MS Analysis—Human protrudin tagged with the FLAG epitope at its NH2 terminus was transiently expressed in HEK293T cells and then purified together with associated proteins from cell lysates by immunoaffinity chromatography with anti-FLAG. Protrudin-associated proteins were digested with Lys-C endoproteinase, and the resulting peptides were analyzed with a nanoscale liquid chromatography-MS/MS system as described previously (22Natsume T.

The peptide mixture was applied to a Mightysil-PR-18 (particle size, 1 μm; Kanto Chemical, Tokyo, Japan) fritless column (45 × 0.150-mm inner diameter) and fractionated over 30 min at a flow rate of 50 nl/min with a 0 to 40% gradient of acetonitrile in 0.1% formic acid. Eluted peptides were sprayed directly into a quadropole time-of-flight hybrid mass spectrometer (Q-Tof Ultima; Micromass, Manchester, UK). Mass spectrometry and MS/MS spectra were obtained in a data-dependent mode. Up to four precursor ions with an intensity above a threshold of 10 counts/s were selected for MS/MS analysis from each survey scan. All of the MS/MS spectra were compared with protein sequences in Swiss Prot and RefSeq (NCBI) with the use of batch processes of the Mascot software package (Matrix Science, London, UK). The criteria for match acceptance included the following: (i) if the match score exceeded the threshold by 10, identification was accepted without further consideration; (ii) if the difference between the score and the threshold was <10, or if a protein was identified on the basis of a single matched MS/MS spectrum, we manually confirmed the raw data before acceptance; and (iii) peptides assigned by fewer than three y series ions and those with a charge of +4 were eliminated regardless of their scores. Cell Culture and Transfection—HEK293T and HeLa cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen). PC12 cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum; they were treated with recombinant human NGF (Millipore, Billerica, MA) at 100 ng/ml in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 1% fetal bovine serum. PC12 cells were transfected with the use of a Nucleofector system (Amaxa Biosystems, Cologne, Germany), whereas other cell types were transfected with the use of the FuGENE 6 reagent (Roche Applied Science). Antibodies—Rabbit polyclonal antibodies (for immunoblot analysis and immunoprecipitation) and a mouse monoclonal antibody (for immunofluorescence staining) specific for protrudin were generated in response to a His6-tagged recombinant protein corresponding to amino acids 206-335 of human protrudin. A mouse monoclonal antibody to VAP-A was obtained from BD Biosciences (San Jose, CA), and rabbit polyclonal antibodies to VAP-B were kindly provided by Masaaki Matsuoka (Keio University, Japan). A mouse monoclonal antibody to glutathione S-transferase (GST) was obtained from MBL (Nagoya, Japan); rabbit polyclonal antibodies (H-15) to His6 were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA); antibodies to FLAG (mouse monoclonal M2 and rabbit polyclonal) and a mouse monoclonal antibody (9E10) to Myc were from Sigma; a mouse monoclonal antibody (HA11) to the HA epitope was from Research Diagnostics (Flanders, NJ); and rabbit polyclonal antibodies (HA-Y11) to HA were from Funakoshi (Tokyo, Japan). Rabbit polyclonal antibodies to calnexin were obtained from Stressgen (Victoria, Canada); a mouse monoclonal antibody to HSP90 (heat shock protein of 90 kDa) was from BD Biosciences; and a mouse monoclonal antibody to protein-disulfide isomerase (PDI) was from Affinity Bioreagents (Golden, CO). Alexa 488- or Alexa 546-conjugated goat antibodies to mouse or rabbit IgG were from Molecular Probes (Invitrogen). Immunoblot Analysis and Immunoprecipitation—The cells were lysed in a solution containing 40 mm HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.6), 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.5% Triton X-100, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm Na3VO4, 25 mm NaF, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, aprotinin (10 μg/ml), leupeptin (10 μg/ml), and 10 μm MG132. After incubation for 10 min at 4 °C, the lysate was centrifuged at 20,400 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and the protein concentration of the resulting supernatant was determined with the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). Whole mouse brain was homogenized by 10 strokes (900 rpm) of a Potter homogenizer in a solution containing 20 mm HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.6), 0.32 m sucrose, 1 mm Na3VO4, 25 mm NaF, aprotinin (10 μg/ml), leupeptin (10 μg/ml), 10 μm MG132, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mm EDTA. The homogenate was centrifuged at 1000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C, and the resulting supernatant was centrifuged at 60,000 × g for 2 h at 4 °C. The crude microsomal pellet was resuspended in a solution containing 40 mm HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.6), 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.1% Triton X-100, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm Na3VO4, 25 mm NaF, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, aprotinin (10 μg/ml), leupeptin (10 μg/ml), and 10 μm MG132, incubated for 10 min at 4 °C, and then centrifuged at 20,400 × g for 1 min at 4 °C. The protein concentration of the resulting supernatant was then determined with the Bradford assay. The cell and mouse brain extracts were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and the separated proteins were transferred to an Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore) and probed with primary antibodies. Immune complexes were detected with Super Signal reagents (Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL). For immunoprecipitation, cell or mouse brain extracts were incubated with anti-FLAG or anti-protrudin and with protein G-Sepharose 4 Fast Flow (Amersham Biosciences). Immunofluorescence Staining—HeLa cells grown on glass coverslips were transfected with the use of the FuGENE 6 reagent and subsequently prepared for immunostaining. In brief, the cells were fixed for 15 min at room temperature with 4% formaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and were then incubated for 1 h at room temperature first with primary antibodies in PBS containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin and 0.1% saponin and then with Alexa 488- or Alexa 546-labeled goat secondary antibodies at a dilution of 1:2000. The cells were finally stained with Hoechst 33258 (Wako, Osaka, Japan), covered with a drop of GEL/MOUNT (Biomeda, Foster City, CA) and examined with a confocal fluorescence microscope (Radiance 2000, Bio-Rad). Transfected PC12 cells were grown on glass coverslips coated with poly-l-lysine and subsequently prepared for immunostaining. In brief, the cells were fixed for 10 min at room temperature with 4% formaldehyde in PBS and were then incubated for 1 h at room temperature first with primary antibodies in PBS containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin and 0.1% saponin and then with Alexa 546-labeled goat secondary antibodies at a dilution of 1:2000. The cells were then covered with a drop of GEL/MOUNT and examined with a confocal fluorescence microscope (Radiance 2000). In Vitro Binding Assay—Recombinant GST- or His6-tagged proteins were expressed in and purified from Escherichia coli. Recombinant His6-protrudin(207-409) (1 μg in 12 μl of a solution containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 150 mm NaCl) and GST-VAP-A or mutants thereof (0.5 μg in 600 μl of a solution containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 150 mm NaCl) were mixed and then incubated at 4 °C for 1 h with rotation. After the addition of glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Biosciences), the mixture was incubated for an additional 1 h at 4 °C with rotation. The beads were then washed twice with 50 volumes of Tris-buffered saline, and the bound proteins were subjected to immunoblot analysis. Quantitation of Process Formation—Transfected cells with processes whose length was greater than the diameter of the nucleus were counted. For evaluation of the effects of FKBP52, protrudin, or protrudin mutants, the cells were immunostained with the M2 antibody to FLAG, whereas the effects of VAP-A or VAP-B were evaluated by immunostaining with the HA-Y11 antibody to HA. Ten nonoverlapping photomicrographs of each sample were examined for cell protrusion with a confocal fluorescence microscope (Radiance 2000). Protrudin Interacts with VAP-A via Its FFAT Motif—To investigate the physiological role of protrudin, we adopted a proteomics approach to identify proteins with which it is physically associated in cells. Human protrudin tagged with the FLAG epitope at its NH2 terminus was expressed in HEK293T cells and then purified together with associated proteins from cell lysates by immunoaffinity chromatography with anti-FLAG. Proteins in the column eluate were digested with Lys-C endoproteinase, and the resulting peptide fragments were analyzed directly with a highly sensitive liquid chromatography-MS/MS system. The protrudin-associated proteins identified by this approach included VAP-A and VAP-B/C (Table 1).TABLE 1Identification of protrudin-associated proteins by proteomics analysisProteinSequence coverage%Vesicle associated membrane protein-associated protein A (VAP-A)14.5Vesicle associated membrane protein-associated protein B and C (VAP-B/C)14.4T-complex protein 1, δ subunit (TCPD)9.2T-complex protein 1, γ subunit (TCPG)7.7T-complex protein 1, ϵ subunit (TCPE)6.3 Open table in a new tab To confirm the interaction between protrudin and VAP, we performed a coimmunoprecipitation assay. Immunoprecipitates were prepared with anti-FLAG from lysates of HEK293T cells transfected with expression vectors both for FLAG-tagged protrudin (or FLAG-tagged FKBP52 (24Davies T.H. Sanchez E.R. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2005; 37: 42-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) as a control) and for HA-tagged VAP-A or VAP-B. We previously showed that protrudin interacts with FKBP38, but not with FKBP12 or FKBP52 (5Shirane M. Ogawa M. Motoyama J. Nakayama K.I. Genes Cells. 2008; 13: 635-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The resulting precipitates were then subjected to immunoblot analysis with anti-HA and anti-FLAG (Fig. 1A). Both VAP-A and VAP-B were detected in the immunoprecipitates prepared from the cells expressing FLAG-protrudin, but the efficiency of immunoprecipitation for VAP-A was much greater than that for VAP-B. Similar analysis was performed to detect the potential interaction between endogenous proteins. Immunoprecipitates prepared from mouse brain extracts with anti-protrudin were subjected to immunoblot analysis with anti-VAP-A and anti-protrudin. Endogenous VAP-A was coprecipitated with endogenous protrudin (Fig. 1B). Together, these various data indicated that protrudin interacts with VAP-A in the physiological setting. Given that VAP interacts with the FFAT motif of certain proteins (11Kawano M. Kumagai K. Nishijima M. Hanada K. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 30279-30288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar, 25Wyles J.P. McMaster C.R. Ridgway N.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29908-29918Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar), we examined whether the binding of VAP-A to protrudin might be dependent on the FFAT motif of protrudin. We constructed two mutants of human protrudin, ΔFFAT and D294A (Fig. 2A); the former lacks the entire FFAT motif (EFKDAIE), and the latter contains Ala instead of Asp294, which is required for binding of proteins to the FFAT motif (6Loewen C.J. Roy A. Levine T.P. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 2025-2035Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). The amount of endogenous VAP-A associated with either mutant in HEK293T cells was greatly reduced compared with that associated with the wild-type protein, even though the expression levels of the protrudin mutants were similar to that of the wild-type protein (Fig. 2B). The residual interaction observed between VAP-A and the protrudin mutants was likely attributable to the fact that VAP and FFAT motif-containing proteins form a 2:2 tetramer (26Kaiser S.E. Brickner J.H. Reilein A.R. Fenn T.D. Walter P. Brunger A.T. Structure. 2005; 13: 1035-1045Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar), with the result that the protrudin mutants may be present in complexes of the endogenous wild-type protrudin with VAP-A. These data thus suggested that the interaction of protrudin with VAP-A is dependent on its FFAT motif. VAP-A Interacts with Protrudin in the ER via Its MSP and TMs—VAP-A contains an major sperm protein (MSP) domain, a coiled-coil (CC) domain, and a single TM. We next investigated which of these domains are required for interaction with protrudin by generating a series of deletion mutants of VAP-A (ΔMSP29, ΔMSP59, ΔMSP89, ΔMSP, MSP, ΔTM, ΔER, and ΔCC) and examining their ability to associate with FLAG-protrudin in a coimmunoprecipitation assay (Fig. 3, A and B). Deletion of 59 amino acids from the NH2 terminus of VAP-A (ΔMSP59) did not appear to affect its interaction with protrudin, whereas deletion of 89 amino acids from the NH2 terminus (ΔMSP89) or of the entire MSP domain (ΔMSP) greatly reduced the efficiency of such binding. The COOH-terminal transmembrane domain of VAP-A appeared essential for the interaction with protrudin, given that the deletion mutants MSP and ΔTM did not show binding. The COOH terminus of VAP-A contains a KDEL-like sequence (KFIL), which functions as an ER retention signal (27Pelham H.R. Cell Struct. Funct. 1996; 21: 413-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). A mutant (ΔER) that lacks this sequence associated with protrudin, albeit with a reduced efficiency. The coiled-coil domain, which is thought to contribute to protein-protein interaction, was not necessary for binding of VAP-A to protrudin. We also prepared a series of point mutants of VAP-A. In particular, mutation of Lys94 and Met96 (equivalent to Lys87 and Met89 of the rat protein), residues that have been shown to be critical for binding to other FFAT motif-containing proteins, attenuated (but did not abolish) the interaction between VAP-A and protrudin (Fig. 3C), whereas other mutations (K52N, T53A/T54A, or K125N) corresponding to residues that are important for binding of the yeast VAP homolog Scs2p to other FFAT motif-containing proteins (28Loewen C.J. Levine T.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 14097-14104Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar) did not affect the interaction of VAP-A with protrudin. To examine the direct interaction between VAP-A and protrudin in vitro, we performed a pulldown assay. Recombinant GST-tagged VAP-A and six mutants thereof were produced in bacteria and tested for their ability to bind to recombinant His6-tagged protrudin (Fig. 3, D and E). The VAP-A mutants K94D/M96D, MSP, ΔMSP, and TM bound to protrudin, although the efficiency of binding appeared to be lower than that with full-length VAP-A. In contrast, the mutants ΔMSP/ΔTM and ΔMSP/ΔTM2 (as well as the negative controls GST and GST-RhoA) did not interact with protrudin. These results suggested that both the MSP and transmembrane domains of VAP-A are required for binding to protrudin. The VAP-A mutant MSP did not interact with protrudin in vivo, although it did so in vitro. One possible explanation of this discrepancy was that the subcellular distribution of the VAP-A mutant differs from that of protrudin. We therefore performed immunofluorescence analysis of HeLa cells expressing various HA-tagged VAP-A constructs and FLAG-tagged protrudin. The immunofluorescence signals of wild-type VAP-A as well as of VAP-A mutants that retain an intact transmembrane domain merged with those of the ER marker protein PDI (Fig. 4A) (29Freedman R.B. Hirst T.R. Tuite M.F. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 331-336Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar), suggesting that they reside in the ER. These VAP-A constructs also colocalized with protrudin (Fig. 4B). In contrast, VAP-A mutants that lack an intact transmembrane domain (MSP and ΔTM) were distributed throughout the cytoplasm and only partially colocalized with protrudin or PDI. The distribution of protrudin appeared to be in part independent of coexpressed VAP-A mutants, probably because a substantial amount of endogenous VAP-A is present in these cells; protrudin presumably associates with the endogenous VAP-A and thereby localizes to the ER. These results thus suggested that both the MSP domain and the transmembrane domain of VAP-A contribute to the interaction with the FFAT motif of protrudin and that the transmembrane domain is also necessary for ER retention, which is a prerequisite for the interaction with protrudin. To examine whether the MSP domain of VAP-A is intrinsically capable of interacting with protrudin in vivo, we generated a chimeric protein, designated MSP-RAMP4TM (Fig. 5A). RAMP4 is a small tail-anchored protein that exposes the NH2 and COOH termini to the cytoplasmic and lumenal sides of the ER membrane, respectively (30Favaloro V. Spasic M. Schwappach B. Dobberstein B. J. Cell Sci. 2008; 121: 1832-1840Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). MSP-RAMP4TM was constructed by fusion of the MSP domain of VAP-A and the COOH-terminal transmembrane domain of RAMP4. Immunofluorescence analysis of HeLa cells expressing FLAG-tagged protrudin as well as Myc epitope-tagged forms of VAP-A, MSP, RAMP4, or MSP-RAMP4TM revealed that VAP-A, RAMP4, and"

Full-Text PDF Open Access Ca2+ is an intracellular second messenger that plays important roles in various physiological functions such as immune response, muscle contraction, neurotransmitter release, and cell proliferation. Intracellular Ca2+ is mainly stored in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). 2The abbreviations used are: ER, endoplasmic reticulum; CRAC, Ca2+ release-activated Ca2+; DDM, n-dodecyl β-d-maltoside; EM, electron microscopy; FSC, Fourier shell correlation; HEK, human embryonic kidney; HBS, HEPES-buffered saline; IP3, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate; NN, neural network; PNGase F, peptidyl N-glycosidase F; Rs, Stokes radius; SA, simulated annealing; SEC, size exclusion chromatography; SPINNS, single particle image analysis method using neural network and simulated annealing; TBS, Tris-buffered saline; TM, transmembrane; TG, thapsigargin. This ER system is distributed through the cytoplasm from around the nucleus to the cell periphery close to the plasma membrane. In non-excitable cells, the ER releases Ca2+ through the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) receptor channel in response to various signals, and the Ca2+ store is depleted. Depletion of Ca2+ then induces Ca2+ influx from outside the cell to help in refilling the Ca2+ stores and to continue Ca2+ rise for several minutes in the cytoplasm (1Berridge M.J. Bootman M.D. Roderick H.L. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 4: 517-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (4211) Google Scholar, 2Parekh A.B. Putney Jr., J.W. Physiol.

Cell Calcium. 1986; 7: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (2108) Google Scholar) and was named store-operated Ca2+ influx. In the immune system, store-operated Ca2+ influx is mainly mediated by the Ca2+ release-activated Ca2+ (CRAC) current, which is a highly Ca2+-selective inwardly rectified current with low conductance (4Hoth M.

Lewis R.S. Daly M. Rao A. Nature. 2006; 441: 179-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (1851) Google Scholar). They form the Orai family and have in common the four transmembrane (TM) segments with relatively large N and C termini. These termini are demonstrated to be in the cytoplasm, because both N- and C-terminally introduced tags are immunologically detected only in the membrane-permeabilized cells (8Feske S. Gwack Y.

The subunit stoichiometry of Orai1 is as yet controversial: it is believed to be an oligomer, presumably a dimer or tetramer even in the steady state (16Gwack Y. Srikanth S. Feske S. Cruz-Guilloty F.

Despite the accumulation of biochemical and electrophysiological data, structural information about Orai1 is limited due to difficulties in purification and crystallization. In this study, we have purified Orai1 in its tetrameric form and have reconstructed the three-dimensional structure from negatively stained electron microscopic (EM) images. Expression Constructs and Transfection of Cells—Full-length mouse Orai1 encoding sequence (GenBank™: NM_175423) was cloned from mouse brain Marathon-Ready cDNA (Clontech, Mountain View, CA) using PCR and was subcloned into pCMV-Tag2B or pCMV-Tag4B vector (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) to introduce a FLAG tag sequence at the N or C terminus (N-FLAG or C-FLAG Orai1). For functional analysis, Orai1 encoding sequence was also subcloned into pCI-neo (Promega, Madison, WI), and mouse STIM1 encoding sequence was subcloned from pApuro-FLAG-tagged mouse STIM1 (31Baba Y. Hayashi K. Fujii Y. Mizushima A. Watarai H. Wakamori M. Numaga T. Mori Y. Iino M. Hikida M. Kurosaki T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

HEK293 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 100 μg/ml kanamycin, and incubated at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. For protein purification, HEK293 cells were transfected with 0.18 μg/cm2 of the N-FLAG Orai1 DNA construct for 6 h using the calcium phosphate precipitation method. After 48 h, the cells were washed twice with a phosphate-buffered saline (137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 4.3 mm Na2HPO4, 1.5 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.4), harvested with a cell scraper, and collected by centrifuging. Cells were stored at -80 °C for further protein purification. C-FLAG Orai1 proteins were similarly expressed. Measurement of Intracellular Ca2+ Concentration ([Ca2+]i) Change and Current Recording—HEK293 cells were transfected using SuperFect Transfection Reagent (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The cells were seeded on polylysine-coated coverslips, and were loaded with fura-2 by incubation in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 1 μm fura-2/AM (Dojindo Laboratories, Kumamoto, Japan), 10% fetal bovine serum, 30 units/ml penicillin, and 30 μg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C for 40 min. The coverslips were then placed in a perfusion chamber mounted on the stage of the microscope. The fura-2 fluorescence images of the cells were recorded in the HEPES-buffered saline (HBS) (in mm): 107 NaCl, 6 KCl, 1.2 MgSO4, 2 CaCl2, 1.2 KH2PO4, 11.5 glucose, 20 HEPES (pH 7.4 adjusted with NaOH) or Ca2+-free HBS containing 0.5 mm EGTA. The fluorescent images were analyzed with a video image analysis system (AQUACOSMOS, Hamamatsu Photonics, Hamamatsu, Japan). These images were converted to Ca2+ concentrations by in vivo calibration (32Hara Y. Wakamori M. Ishii M. Maeno E. Nishida M. Yoshida T. Yamada H. Shimizu S. Mori E. Kudoh J. Shimizu N. Kurose H. Okada Y. Imoto K. Mori Y. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 163-173Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar). Thapsigargin (Calbiochem) was diluted to the final concentration (2 μm) in Ca2+-free HBS and applied to the cells by perfusion, as previously described (33Mori Y. Wakamori M. Miyakawa T. Hermosura M. Hara Y. Nishida M. Hirose K. Mizushima A. Kurosaki M. Mori E. Gotoh K. Okada T. Fleig A. Penner R. Iino M. Kurosaki T. J. Exp. Med. 2002; 195: 673-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Whole cell currents were recorded at room temperature using the conventional whole cell mode of the patch clamp technique (34Inoue R. Okada T. Onoue H. Hara Y. Shimizu S. Naitoh S. Ito Y. Mori Y. Circ. Res. 2001; 88: 325-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar) with EPC9 amplifier (HEKA, Pfalz, Germany). Voltage ramps of 50-ms duration spanning a range of -100 to +100 mV were delivered from a holding potential of 0 mV at a rate of 0.5 Hz over a period of 100–400 s. The recordings were sampled at 2.0 kHz and filtered at 2.9 kHz. The external solutions contained (in mm): 145 NaCl, 2.8 KCl, 10 CsCl, 2 MgCl2, 10 CaCl2, 10 glucose, 10 HEPES, 10 tetraethylammonium chloride (adjusted to pH 7.2 with NaOH). The pipette solution contained (in mm): 120 CsCl, 8 NaCl, 10 Cs-1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid tetrakis, 3 MgCl2, 10 HEPES, 0.04 IP3 (adjusted to pH 7.2 with CsOH). All data are expressed as mean ± S.E. The data were accumulated under each condition from at least three independent experiments. The p values are the results of Student's t tests. Protein Purification—The transfected cells were homogenized with a Potter Teflon homogenizer in Tris-buffered saline (TBS, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4 at 4 °C, 140 mm NaCl, 0.02% sodium azide) containing a protease inhibitor mixture (Wako Pure Chemicals, Osaka, Japan). All procedures were performed on ice or at 4 °C. Cell debris was eliminated from the homogenate by centrifuging at 10,000 × g for 15 min. The supernatant was re-centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h to sediment membrane fractions. The membrane fraction was solubilized in the same buffer supplemented with 25 mm n-dodecyl β-d-maltoside (DDM, Sigma). After centrifuging at 100,000 × g for 30 min, the supernatant containing FLAG-tagged Orai1 was applied to an anti-FLAG M2 affinity gel (Sigma) column, equilibrated in advance. The column was washed with 15 column bed volumes of buffer A (TBS containing 1 mm DDM, 750 mm MgCl2, and 5% glycerol) supplemented with the protease inhibitors. The bound Orai1 proteins were eluted with buffer A containing 125 μg/ml FLAG peptide (Sigma). The eluate containing Orai1 protein was concentrated 15 times with a Microcon centrifuge filter unit YM-100 (Millipore, Billerica, MA) and further purified by Superdex 200 (3.2/30) size exclusion chromatography (SEC) in a Smartsystem (GE Healthcare) using buffer A. The elution of protein was profiled at 280 nm absorbance and subfractionated into 20-μl fractions. Deglycosylation and Chemical Cross-linking—To remove the N-linked glycan, purified Orai1 protein was treated with 0.08 unit/μl of peptidyl N-glycosidase F (PNGase F) at 25 °C for 1 h. The deglycosylated Orai1 was then separated from PNGase F using Superdex 200 (3.2/30) SEC. For chemical cross-linking, the TBS component in the buffer was substituted in advance with phosphate-buffered saline by SEC. Glutaraldehyde was mixed with the Orai1-containing solution to the indicated final concentrations, at 25 °C for 30 min. Cross-linking was terminated by incubation with an equal volume of SDS-sample buffer at 25 °C for 15 min. Proteins were separated in 3–10% polyacrylamide gel and visualized by silver staining. SDS-PAGE—Samples were mixed with an SDS-sample buffer containing 62.5 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 25% glycerol, 2% SDS, 0.04 m dithiothreitol, and 0.01% bromphenol blue, and incubated at 25 °C for 15 min. Proteins were separated in 10–20% polyacrylamide gel and visualized by silver staining. For Western blots, proteins were transferred to the polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and analyzed with alkaline phosphatase-labeled anti-FLAG antibodies (Sigma). Native Gel Electrophoresis—Each sample was mixed with an equal volume of sample buffer (62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 25% glycerol, and 0.01% bromphenol blue) and electrophoresed in 3–10% polyacrylamide gel using a running buffer containing 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.4, 192 mm glycine, and 1 mm DDM. Electrophoresis was performed at 3.4 V/cm at 4 °C. Proteins were visualized by silver staining. Estimation of Stokes Radius by SEC—High molecular weight standard proteins (GE Healthcare) and purified Orai1 protein were analyzed by Superdex 200 (3.2/30) SEC in a Smartsystem (35Mio K. Ogura T. Mio M. Shimizu H. Hwang T.C. Sato C. Sohma Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 30300-30310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The elution profile of each protein was obtained at 280 nm. The distribution coefficient (Kav) was calculated from the equation Kav = (Ve - Vo)/(Vt - Vo), where Ve is the elution volume of each standard protein or Orai1-detergent complex. Column void volume (Vo) was determined by the elution volume of blue dextran 2000, whereas Vt represents the total bed volume (2.40 ml). The Stokes radius (Rs) of Orai1 was determined by interpolation using a calibration curve, which was constructed by plotting the Rs of reference proteins versus (-log Kav)1/2 according the relationship (-log Kav)1/2 = α (β + Rs). The Orai1 data are presented as mean ± S.E. The standard proteins used were: thyroglobulin (Rs, 85 Å), ferritin (Rs, 61 Å), catalase (Rs, 52 Å), and aldolase (Rs, 48 Å). Transmission Electron Microscopy—Purified Orai1 proteins were adsorbed to thin carbon films supported by copper mesh grids, which were rendered hydrophilic in advance by glow discharge in low air pressure. Samples were washed with 10 drops of double-distilled water, negatively stained with 2% uranyl acetate solution for 30 s twice, blotted, and dried in air. Micrographs of negatively stained particles were imaged using a JEM-100CX transmission electron microscope (JEOL, Tokyo, Japan) at ×52,100 magnification with 100 kV acceleration voltage. Images were recorded on Kodak SO163 electron microscopy film (Eastman Kodak, Rochester, NY), developed with D19 developer (Kodak), and digitized with a Scitex Leafscan 45 scanner (Leaf Systems Inc., Westborough, MA) at a pixel size of 1.92 Å at the specimen level. Automated Particle Selection and Image Analysis—We have developed a single particle image analysis method using neural network (36Ogura T. Sato C. J. Struct.

Biol. 1996; 116: 17-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (1049) Google Scholar). Orai1 projections were first picked up using the auto-accumulation method with simulated annealing (SA) (39Ogura T. Sato C. J. Struct. Biol. 2004; 146: 344-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). 289 particles in 180 × 180 pixel subframes were selected and used to train a three-layer pyramid-type neural network (NN) (36Ogura T. Sato C. J. Struct. Biol. 2001; 136: 227-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 37Ogura T. Sato C. J. Struct. Biol. 2004; 145: 63-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Using the trained NN, 3681 particles were selected. After background subtraction, the particles selected by NN were aligned rotationally and translationally (43Frank J.

The aligned images were sorted into 120 classes by the modified growing neural gas network method (38Ogura T. Iwasaki K. Sato C. J. Struct. Biol. 2003; 143: 185-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Their class averages were adopted as new references, and this cycle, from alignment to averaging, was repeated 41 times. The Euler angles of the class averages were automatically determined by the echo-correlated three-dimensional reconstruction method with SA (40Ogura T. Sato C. J. Struct. Biol. 2006; 156: 371-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) assuming a C4 symmetry, and used to calculate a primary three-dimensional structure by the simultaneous iterative reconstruction technique (45Penczek P. Radermacher M. Frank J. Ultramicroscopy. 1992; 40: 33-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). The reprojections from the volume were employed as references for multireference alignment, and raw images in the library were aligned and further clustered, providing improved cluster averages. From the averages, a new three-dimensional map was generated by the echo-correlated reconstruction method without a three-dimensional reference. The three-dimensional map was further refined by projection matching (46Penczek P.A. Grassucci R.A. Frank J. Ultramicroscopy. 1994; 53: 251-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar) followed by an optimization using echo-correlated reconstruction. This cycle was repeated 19 times. Particle images correlating poorly with the three-dimensional projections were automatically rejected using the cross-correlation function. The final reconstruction includes 2940 particles, 79.9% of all the selected images. The resolution of the final three-dimensional map was assessed using the Fourier shell correlation (FSC) function (47Harauz G. Van Heel M. Optik. 1986; 73: 146-156Google Scholar) at the threshold of 0.5. Formation of the Complexes between Orai1 and Antibody or between Orai1 and Wheat Germ Agglutinin—Anti-FLAG antibodies were added to purified Orai1 proteins in binding buffer (TBS containing 1 mm DDM, 350 mm MgCl2, and 5% glycerol) and incubated at 4 °C for 20 min. Unbound antibodies were then separated from the Orai1-antibody complex using Superdex 200 (3.2/30) SEC, and the complexes were negatively stained and imaged as described above. Fab fragments of anti-FLAG antibodies were generated by papain digestion (Pierce) and conjugated with colloidal gold (5 nm in diameter, BB International, Cardiff, UK). Non-reacted Fab fragments were removed using 10–30% glycerol gradient centrifugation. The Fab-gold conjugates were mixed with purified Orai1 in binding buffer and incubated at 4 °C for 20 min. Orai1-Fab-gold complexes were separated from unbound Fab-gold by Superose 6 (3.2/30) SEC, negatively stained, and observed by EM. Wheat germ agglutinin-gold conjugates (EY Laboratories, San Mateo, CA) were mixed with purified Orai1 in binding buffer at 4 °C for 1 h. This mixture was applied to an anti-FLAG M2 affinity gel column. The column was washed with 6 column bed volumes of binding buffer. The complexes between Orai1 and wheat germ agglutinin-gold were eluted with FLAG peptide in binding buffer, negatively stained, and observed by EM. Expression and Purification of Orai1 Protein—Because endogenous Orai1 protein is scarce and not sufficient for purification, we constructed N-terminally FLAG-tagged Orai1 recombinant (N-FLAG Orai1) and expressed it in HEK293 cells. The channel function of wild-type and N-FLAG Orai1 was measured by the fluorescence of fura-2 and by the whole cell current. In comparison to the control experiment, overexpression of wild-type Orai1 reduced cytoplasmic [Ca2+]i rises when the store depletion was induced by thapsigargin, an inhibitor of the sarcoendoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase pump (Fig. 1A). The [Ca2+]i rises were similarly reduced with the overexpression of N-FLAG Orai1. In contrast, STIM1 co-expressed with wild-type or N-FLAG Orai1 substantially increased [Ca2+]i (Fig. 1B) (13Mercer J.C. Dehaven W.I. Smyth J.T. Wedel B. Boyles R.R. Bird G.S. Putney Jr., J.W. J.

Co-expression of STIM1 with wild-type or N-FLAG Orai1 generated large currents with typical inwardly rectifying current-voltage relationships in CRAC current (Fig. 1C). These results confirm that the N-FLAG Orai1 protein forms a fully functional CRAC channel with STIM1. We also constructed C-terminally FLAG-tagged Orai1 and examined its function in [Ca2+]i regulation. We could not find any significant difference in the channel function from either the wild-type or the N-FLAG Orai1 (data not shown). From the membranes of transiently expressed HEK293 cells, N-FLAG Orai1 proteins were solubilized with nonionic detergent DDM a"

https://openalex.org/W2064061221,"Rapid protein kinase D (PKD) activation and phosphorylation via protein kinase C (PKC) have been extensively documented in many cell types cells stimulated by multiple stimuli. In contrast, little is known about the role and mechanism(s) of a recently identified sustained phase of PKD activation in response to G protein-coupled receptor agonists. To elucidate the role of biphasic PKD activation, we used Swiss 3T3 cells because PKD expression in these cells potently enhanced duration of ERK activation and DNA synthesis in response to G(q)-coupled receptor agonists. Cell treatment with the preferential PKC inhibitors GF109203X or Gö6983 profoundly inhibited PKD activation induced by bombesin stimulation for <15 min but did not prevent PKD catalytic activation induced by bombesin stimulation for longer times (>60 min). The existence of sequential PKC-dependent and PKC-independent PKD activation was demonstrated in 3T3 cells stimulated with various concentrations of bombesin (0.3-10 nm) or with vasopressin, a different G(q)-coupled receptor agonist. To gain insight into the mechanisms involved, we determined the phosphorylation state of the activation loop residues Ser(744) and Ser(748). Transphosphorylation targeted Ser(744), whereas autophosphorylation was the predominant mechanism for Ser(748) in cells stimulated with G(q)-coupled receptor agonists. We next determined which phase of PKD activation is responsible for promoting enhanced ERK activation and DNA synthesis in response to G(q)-coupled receptor agonists. We show, for the first time, that the PKC-independent phase of PKD activation mediates prolonged ERK signaling and progression to DNA synthesis in response to bombesin or vasopressin through a pathway that requires epidermal growth factor receptor-tyrosine kinase activity. Thus, our results identify a novel mechanism of G(q)-coupled receptor-induced mitogenesis mediated by sustained PKD activation through a PKC-independent pathway."

The sequestration of its components within the cytoplasm rests on the presence of the eukaryotic-specific polypeptide extensions that characterize the human enzymes, as compared with their prokaryotic counterparts. The cellular mobility of several synthetases, assessed by measuring fluorescence recovery after photobleaching, suggested that they are not freely diffusible within the cytoplasm.

Our observations have conceptual implications for understanding how translation machinery is organized in vivo. A wealth of data have suggested that the cytoplasm of human cells is highly organized. This is especially the case as far as translation machinery is concerned. Translation of genetic information involves several supramolecular assemblies, including the ribosome and multiprotein complexes involved in the initiation and elongation steps of the protein biosynthesis process (1Kapp L.D.

Colocalization of several components of the translation machinery, including ribosomes, mRNAs, initiation and elongation factors, and aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases can be easily observed in dendrites of neural cells (9Barbarese E.

Thus, the knowledge of the cellular organization of the components of MARS in space and in time is a key factor for understanding the regulation of the activity of its components. Using GFP fusion proteins, we analyzed the cellular localization of aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases and their cellular mobility by measuring fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP). We observed that these enzymes, associated or not within multienzyme complexes, are not freely diffusible in the cytoplasm of living cells. To evaluate the extent of macromolecular organization of the cell machinery, proteomic approaches have been conducted to identify protein interaction networks. High throughput two-hybrid analyses led to the description of the yeast (23Uetz P. Giot L. Cagney G. Mansfield T.A. Judson R.S. Knight J.R. Lockshon D. Narayan V. Srinivasan M. Pochart P.

However, assembly of multiprotein complexes often involves weak protein-protein interactions between two isolated partners of the complex and is difficult to depict by the two-hybrid approach. Affinity purification is a method of choice to isolate macromolecular complexes directly from cell extracts. The tandem affinity purification (TAP) strategy has been successfully employed to screen the yeast proteome organization (25Gavin A.C. Aloy P. Grandi P. Krause R. Boesche M. Marzioch M. Rau C.

We isolated by TAP the MARS or VEGA complexes, and SerRS, a “free” synthetase. Apart from the major partners of the complexes, additional proteins were also found to copurify in substoichiometric amounts. Our data show that transient association of the components of translation with ribosomes and actin in the eukaryote cell is a key element of their subcellular organization. Confocal Imaging—The complete cDNAs encoding human p18, p38, p43, ArgRS, LysRS, and AsnRS were introduced between the EcoRI and BamHI sites of pEGFP-N1 (BD Biosciences). Constructs of ΔNLysRS, ΔNAsnRS, and p43(ARF) fused to GFP in pEGFP-N1 correspond to LysRS, AsnRS, and p43 with N-terminal deletions of 56, 83, and 106 amino acid residues, respectively. The cDNAs encoding human MetRS and its derivatives were introduced either between the XhoI and EcoRI sites of pEGFP-C1 or between the EcoRI and AgeI sites of pEGFP-N1 (BD Biosciences). The different fusion proteins contained human MetRS sequences from amino acid residues 1-900 (MetRS), 215-900 (ΔNMetRS), 1-896 (MetRSΔK), 1-823 (MetRSΔC), 215-896 (ΔNMetRSΔK), or 215-823 (ΔNMetRSΔC). HeLa-ST cells were grown in F12 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. The cells were transfected with Effectene (Qiagen). The stability of the fusions expressed in HeLa cells was checked by Western blot analysis with anti-GFP antibodies. The cells were grown in 8-well Lab-Tek II chambers (Nalge Nunc International) and observed by confocal laser scanning microscopy using a Leica TCS SP2 confocal microscope equipped with an RSP 500 mirror. GFP was excited using laser line 488 nm of an argon laser (17 milliwatts) and detected at 500-535 nm. The oil objective used was 100× (NA 1.40), giving a resolution of 140 nm in the x,y plane and 240 nm along the z axis. For FRAP experiments, three single scans were acquired at 1.7-s intervals to determine the initial fluorescence intensity, followed by a bleaching period of 16.86 s resulting from 10 scans at 1.7-s intervals (pulse of ∼10 ms/pixel). To monitor fluorescence recovery, 15 images were collected at 1.7-s intervals, followed by 12 images at 3.7-s intervals, and 12 images at 9.7-s intervals. The laser power was 17 milliwatts during the bleaching period and 1.7 milliwatts for imaging. Construction of Stable Cell Lines Expressing TAP-tagged Proteins—The TAP tag sequences were introduced into the mammalian expression vector pSG5 (2Kaminska M. Havrylenko S. Decottignies P. Gillet S. Le Maréchal P. Negrutskii B. Mirande M. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 6053-6060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The cDNAs encoding the proteins of interest were introduced into the EcoRI or BamHI sites of pSG5-CTAP to create fusion proteins carrying a TAP tag appended to the C-terminal extremity of the protein. The cDNAs encoding human p38 (GGGGGATCCATAATGCCGATGTACCAGGTA and GGGGGATCCCTTAAGGAGCTTGAGGG), SerRS (GGGGGATCCATAATGGTGCTGGATCTGGATT and GGGGGATCCAGCATCGGTGACCTCCAT), and EF1Bβ (GGGGGATCCATAATGGCTACAAACTTCCTA and GGGGGATCCGATCTTGTTGAAAGCTGCGA) were amplified by PCR with the two oligonucleotides indicated and cloned into pSG5-CTAP. The constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. HeLa cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mm glutamine, 100 μg/ml of penicillin and streptomycin. The cells were transfected with Effectene (Qiagen). Stable transformants were isolated by selection with G418. Isolation of Complexes—Cells (3 billions) grown in 100 dishes of 140-mm diameter were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, harvested at 4 °C by mechanical detachment with a cell lifter, washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and resuspended in 10 ml of buffer A (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm dithiothreitol) containing 0.5% Triton X-100 and protease inhibitors (1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 2.5 mm benzamidine). The lysate was clarified by centrifugation at 40,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C, and the TAP-tagged proteins were purified by chromatography on IgG-Sepharose 6 Fast Flow and Calmoduline-Sepharose 4B (GE Healthcare), as described previously (2Kaminska M.

The purified proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and visualized by staining with Coomassie Blue R250 or silver nitrate. Polypeptides were identified by mass spectrometry after in-gel digestion and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry performed essentially as described (2Kaminska M.

The proteins were identified using the search program Mascot reducing the Swiss-Prot/TrEMBL and NCBI data bases to the Homo sapiens species. Construction of Knock-down Strains for the p38 and p43 Components of MARS—Retroviral vectors expressing small interfering RNA targeting p38 or p43 were constructed in pLTRH1 (28Barton G.M. Medzhitov R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 14943-14945Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar), as described previously (2Kaminska M. Havrylenko S. Decottignies P. Gillet S.

HeLa cells were infected by viruses as described (28Barton G.M. Medzhitov R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The knock-down of the corresponding component of MARS was checked by Western blot analysis with anti-p38 or anti-p43 antibodies. Sucrose Gradient Analysis of Polysomes—HeLa cells grown to 60% confluency in a dish (diameter of 8.5 cm) were incubated 5 min at 37 °C after addition of cycloheximide at 50 μg/ml, washed twice with 5 ml of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline containing cycloheximide at 50 μg/ml, and lysed by addition of 150 μl of 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 35 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5% Triton X-100, and protease inhibitors (1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 2.5 mm benzamidine). The extracts were subjected to centrifugation on 15-45% sucrose gradients containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 35 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol. The gradients were centrifuged in a SW 41 Ti rotor (Beckman) at 27,000 rpm for 3 h and collected into 10 fractions, starting from the bottom of the tube. A254 was recorded. The fractions were subjected to Western blotting after precipitation by trichloroacetic acid/Triton, as described (2Kaminska M. Havrylenko S. Decottignies P. Gillet S. Le Maréchal P. Negrutskii B. Mirande M. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 6053-6060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Antibodies and Western Blot Analysis—Monoclonal antibodies directed to GFP were from BD Biosciences. Polyclonal anti-p38, anti-p43, anti-GluProRS, anti-GlnRS, anti-MetRS, and anti-AspRS antibodies have been described previously (29Mirande M. Cirakoglu B. Waller J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 11056-11063Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Western blot analyses were conducted with goat anti-rabbit or goat anti-mouse secondary antibodies conjugated with peroxidase (Chemicon) and the ECL detection reagents (GE Healthcare). Subcellular Localization of Aminoacyl-tRNA Synthetases—The cellular localization of several components of MARS (MetRS, LysRS, ArgRS, p18, p38, and p43) and of AsnRS, a representative of free synthetases, was investigated. Transient transfection of HeLa cells with constructs that expressed those cDNA fused to the GFP clearly provided evidence that MARS and free aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase prominently localize in the cytoplasm (Fig. 1A). To investigate the role of complex assembly on the subcellular localization of an integral component of MARS, we analyzed the cellular distribution of different domains of MetRS fused to GFP. When GFP was added either to its N terminus (GFP-MetRS) or to its C terminus (MetRS-GFP), full-length MetRS was always excluded from the nucleus (Fig. 1B). As compared with its prokaryotic homologue, human MetRS possesses a large (214 amino acid residues) polypeptide extension appended to its N terminus (30Kaminska M. Shalak V. Mirande M. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 14309-14316Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Deletion of this extension precludes association of MetRS to the complex (31Mirande M. Kellermann O. Waller J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 11049-11055Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The GFP-ΔNMetRS fusion protein was essentially localized in the cytoplasm, but a faint nuclear fluorescence was clearly apparent (Fig. 1B). A ΔNMetRS-GFP fusion displayed a similar localization pattern (Fig. 1B). Thus, the cytoplasmic retention of MetRS does not rest only on its ability to associate with MARS. A short (77 amino acid residues), eukaryotic-specific polypeptide extension is also appended to the C terminus of human MetRS. Neither of the N- and C-terminal extensions are necessary for the activity of MetRS, but the C-terminal domain improves the tRNA binding properties of MetRS (30Kaminska M. Shalak V. Mirande M. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 14309-14316Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The RNA-binding domain of MetRS can be divided into two regions: a helix-turn-helix motif found in other aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (32Cahuzac B. Berthonneau E. Birlirakis N. Guittet E. Mirande M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 445-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) and a lysine-rich cluster at the very C terminus. Deletion of this cluster (GFP-MetRSΔK) or of the complete C-terminal domain (GFP-MetRSΔC) did not alter cellular localization of MetRS (Fig. 1B). In these two constructs, the N-domain of MetRS is present, and the enzyme retains its ability to associate with MARS. The N- and C-terminal deletions were combined to give GFP-ΔNMetRSΔK and GFP-ΔNMetRSΔC. The GFP fusion with the minimal human MetRS (GFP-ΔNMetRSΔC), recapitulating the MetRS core enzyme found in eubacteria such as Aquifex aeolicus, was no more excluded from the nuclear compartment (Fig. 1B). We therefore conclude that protein-protein interactions, involving the N-domain of MetRS that mediates its association with MARS, and protein-RNA interactions, involving the C-domain of MetRS, are both required for cytoplasmic confinement of this enzyme. Subcellular Mobility of Human, Cytoplasmic Aminoacyl-tRNA Synthetases—The cytoplasmic mobilities of several aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases from MARS and of truncated derivatives that had lost their ability to associate within MARS were analyzed. These proteins were fused to GFP, and stable HeLa cell lines were isolated. We verified that MetRS-GFP from a crude extract of stable transformant of HeLa cells behaved as a high molecular weight entity, whereas the ΔNMetRSΔC derivative did not (Fig. 2). To probe the degree of mobility of these proteins in the cytoplasm of a living cell, we carried out FRAP. In our FRAP experiments, a defined region of the living cell was bleached (bleached region, filled circle in Fig. 3A), and the time course of fluorescence recovery was recorded in the bleached area. The kinetics of recovery is a measure of the mobility of the GFP-labeled protein in the living cell. In addition, we also recorded the variation of fluorescence in another region of the cell, located at the opposite of the bleached area (distal region, open circles in Fig. 3A). Initially, the two regions of the cell had a similar fluorescence intensity. After photobleaching, the time required to reach a new fluorescence equilibrium between the two distant regions of the cell is also a signal of the mobility of the protein throughout the cell.FIGURE 3FRAP of aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases in the cytoplasm of living cell. FRAP was conducted on stably transformed cell lines. The areas of the bleach region where fluorescence recovery is monitored and of the distal region where fluorescence intensity is recorded in parallel are indicated with a closed and open symbols, respectively. The inset in A illustrates an experiment conducted with MetRS-GFP. Kinetics of fluorescence intensity variations in the bleach and distal regions are indicated with closed and open symbols, respectively.

B, FRAP of AsnRS-GFP and of ΔNAsnRS-GFP.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) After photobleaching of MetRS-GFP (Fig. 3A), the recovery in the bleached region reached a new equilibrium after 180 s, with a half-time of 36.6 s. This half-time of recovery is very long, as compared with the value of 4.9 s obtained for GFP alone (Table 1), a protein known to be freely diffusible in the cytoplasm of human cells. Moreover, a new equilibrium was not reached between the distal areas of the cell, even after 180 s of recovery, suggesting that MetRS-GFP exchanged very slowly between the different regions of the cell. The fluorescence intensity in the distal region remained constant during photobleaching and slowly decreased during the recovery period, with a half-time of 249 ± 60 s. The low mobility of MetRS-GFP could be the consequence of its association with MARS, and/or of the interaction of MARS with some subcellular components, that would preclude its free diffusion. When GFP-ΔNMetRSΔC was photobleached (Fig. 3A), fluorescence recovery in the bleached region was observed after 60 s, with a half-time of 13.7 s, approximately three times faster that with MetRS-GFP. In the mean time, the fluorescence of GFP-ΔNMetRSΔC also rapidly decreased in the distal region (half-time of 16.9 ± 2.7 s), and a new fluorescence equilibrium was reached after ∼50 s of recovery. These results are consistent with the facts that ΔNMetRSΔC has lost its ability to associate with MARS (deletion of its N terminus) and to associate with nucleic acids (deletion of its C terminus). Similar measurements of fluorescence recovery were conducted after photobleaching of other components of MARS. Stable transformants of HeLa cells expressing LysRS, p43, or p38 fused to GFP were obtained and displayed half-times of recovery similar to those observed with MetRS-GFP (Table 1). These data are consistent with the finding that all of these proteins are members of the same multienzyme complex. As expected, deletion of the N terminus of LysRS had no effect on its half-time of recovery (Table 1), in good agreement with the observation that association of LysRS to MARS does not involve its N-terminal polypeptide extension (33Robinson J.C. Kerjan P. Mirande M. J. Mol.

Open table in a new tab We also analyzed the cellular mobility of derivatives of MARS that have lost their ability to associate within the particle. The p43 subunit of MARS is a procytokine that is matured by proteolytic processing during apoptosis (21Shalak V. Guigou L. Kaminska M. Wautier M.P. Wautier J.L. Mirande M. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 10935-10943Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). After cleavage, its C-terminal domain, p43(ARF) is released from the cell and is converted into p43(EMAPII), a putative cytokine (19Kao J. Fan Y.G. Haehnel I. Brett J. Greenberg S. Clauss M.

When FRAP analysis was conducted with p43(ARF)-GFP instead of p43-GFP, the half-time of recovery was much lower (8.1 s for p43(ARF), as compared with 33.1 s for p43; Table 1), consistent with the fact that p43(ARF) is released from MARS. In all cases, when transient transformants of HeLa cells were analyzed by FRAP, the half-times of fluorescence recovery were significantly lower as compared with those observed with stable transformants, especially in the cases of proteins that associate with MARS (Table 1). This reflects the heterogeneous behavior of the proteins overexpressed after transient transformation of HeLa cells that were in part associated with MARS, and predominantly present as free enzymes because the endogenous partner proteins were present in substoichiometric amounts (see the analysis of stable or transient transformants of HeLa cells with p43-GFP shown in Fig. 2). The mobility of AsnRS, a free enzyme not associated within stable multiprotein complexes, in the cytoplasm of a living cell was also assessed by FRAP. The half-life of recovery of AsnRS-GFP (39.5 s) was much higher than that observed for GFP (4.9 s) or for ΔNAsnRS-GFP (19.6 s), a derivative of AsnRS with a deletion of its N-terminal, tRNA-binding domain (34Beaulande M. Kron M. Härtlein M. FEBS Lett. 2001; 494: 170-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3B and Table 1). Thus, the limited mobility of aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases in the cytoplasm of human cells is not restricted to those that form stable multiprotein complexes. The kinetics of recovery in the distal region of the cell was much faster for ΔNAsnRS-GFP (26.6 ± 3.2s) than for AsnRS-GFP (113 ± 44 s). However, in contrast with the components of MARS, for AsnRS-GFP and ΔNAsnRS-GFP a new fluorescence equilibrium was reached between the bleached and the distal regions of the cell after 150 s of recovery.

https://openalex.org/W1982021988,"Activation of inflammatory immune responses during granuloma formation by the host upon infection of mycobacteria is one of the crucial steps that is often associated with tissue remodeling and breakdown of the extracellular matrix. In these complex processes, cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) plays a major role in chronic inflammation and matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) significantly in tissue remodeling. In this study, we investigated the molecular mechanisms underlying Phosphatidyl-myo-inositol dimannosides (PIM2), an integral component of the mycobacterial envelope, triggered COX-2 and MMP-9 expression in macrophages. PIM2 triggers the activation of Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase (PI3K) and Notch1 signaling leading to COX-2 and MMP-9 expression in a Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2)-MyD88 dependent manner. Notch1 signaling perturbations data demonstrate the involvement of the cross-talk with members of PI3K and Mitogen activated protein kinase pathway. Enforced expression of the cleaved Notch1 in macrophages induces the expression of COX-2 and MMP-9. PIM2 triggered significant p65 nuclear factor -κB (NF-κB) nuclear translocation that was dependent on activation of PI3K or Notch1 signaling. Furthermore, COX-2 and MMP-9 expression requires Notch1 mediated recruitment of Suppressor of Hairless (CSL) and NF-κB to respective promoters. Inhibition of PIM2 induced COX-2 resulted in marked reduction in MMP-9 expression clearly implicating the role of COX-2 dependent signaling events in driving the MMP-9 expression. Taken together, these data implicate PI3K and Notch1 signaling as obligatory early proximal signaling events during PIM2 induced COX-2 and MMP-9 expression in macrophages."
https://openalex.org/W1970323849,"The alpha-7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (alpha7-nAChR) is well known as a potent calcium ionophore that, in the brain, has been implicated in excitotoxicity and hence in the underlying mechanisms of neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease. Previous research implied that the activity of this receptor may be modified by exposure to a peptide fragment derived from the C-terminal region of the enzyme acetylcholinesterase. This investigation was undertaken to determine if the functional changes observed could be attributed to peptide binding interaction with the alpha7-nAChR, or peptide modulation of receptor expression.This study provides evidence that two peptides derived from the C-terminus of acetylcholinesterase, not only selectively displace specific bungarotoxin binding at the alpha7-nAChR, but also alter receptor binding properties for its familiar ligands, including the alternative endogenous agonist choline. Of more long-term significance, these peptides also induce upregulation of alpha7-nAChR mRNA and protein expression, as well as enhancing receptor trafficking to the plasma membrane.The results reported here demonstrate a hitherto unknown relationship between the alpha7-nAChR and the non-enzymatic functions of acetylcholinesterase, mediated independently by its C-terminal domain. Such an interaction may prove valuable as a pharmacological tool, prompting new approaches for understanding, and combating, the process of neurodegeneration."
https://openalex.org/W2072884065,"Background O-linked β-N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc) modification of proteins mediates stress response and cellular motility in animal cells. The plant lectin concanavalin A can increase nuclear O-GlcNAc levels and decrease cytoplasmic O-GlcNAc levels in T lymphocytes. However, the functions of O-GlcNAc signaling in plants, as well as the relation between plant lectins and O-GlcNAc in response to environmental stimuli are largely undefined. Methodology/Principal Findings We describe a jacalin-like lectin VER2 in wheat that shows N-acetylglucosamine and galactose specificity. Immunocytochemical localization showed VER2 expression induced predominantly at potential nuclear structures in shoot tips and young leaves and weakly in cytoplasm in response to vernalization. In contrast, under devernalization (continuous stimulation with a higher temperature after vernalization), VER2 signals appeared predominantly in cytoplasm. 2-D electrophoresis, together with western blot analysis, showed phosphorylation modification of VER2 under vernalization. Immunoblot assay with O-GlcNAc-specific antibody revealed that vernalization increased O-GlcNAc modification of proteins at the global level. An O-GlcNAc-modified protein co-immunoprecipitated with VER2 in vernalized wheat plants but not in devernalized materials. The dynamic of VER2 was observed in transgenic Arabidopsis overexpressing the VER2-GFP fusion protein. Overexpressed VER2 accelerated nuclear migration. Immunogold labeling and indirect immunofluoresence colocalization assay indicated that VER2-GFP was targeted to the secretory pathway. Conclusions/Significance O-GlcNAc signaling is involved in the vernalization response in wheat, and phosphorylation is necessary for the lectin VER2 involving O-GlcNAc signaling during vernalization. Our findings open the way to studies of O-GlcNAc protein modification in response to environmental signals in plants."
https://openalex.org/W2168425992,"We investigated the physiological role of endogenous MAPK-activating death domain-containing protein (MADD), a splice variant of the IG20 gene, that can interact with TNFR1 in tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFalpha)-induced activation of NF-kappaB, MAPK, ERK1/2, JNK, and p38. Using exon-specific short hairpin RNAs expressing lentiviruses, we knocked down the expression of all IG20 splice variants or MADD, which is overexpressed in cancer cells. Abrogation of MADD expression rendered cells highly susceptible to TNFalpha-induced apoptosis in the absence of cycloheximide. It also resulted in a dramatic loss in TNFalpha-induced activation of MAPK without any apparent effect on NF-kappaB activation. This observation was substantiated by an accompanying loss in the activation of p90RSK, a key downstream target of MAPK, whereas the NF-kappaB-regulated interleukin 6 levels remained unaffected. Endogenous MADD knockdown, however, did not affect epidermal growth factor-induced MAPK activation thereby demonstrating the specific requirement of MADD for TNF receptor-mediated MAPK activation. Re-expression of short hairpin RNA-resistant MADD in the absence of endogenous IG20 expression rescued the cells from TNFalpha-induced apoptosis. The requirement for MADD was highly specific for TNFalpha-induced activation of MAPK but not the related JNK and p38 kinases. Loss of MADD expression resulted in reduced Grb2 and Sos1/2 recruitment to the TNFR1 complex and decreased Ras and MEKK1/2 activation. These results demonstrate the essential role of MADD in protecting cancer cells from TNFalpha-induced apoptosis by specifically activating MAPKs through Grb2 and Sos1/2 recruitment, and its potential as a novel cancer therapeutic target."
https://openalex.org/W2019559173,"Influenza A virus (IAV) causes respiratory tract infections leading to recurring epidemics with high rates of morbidity and mortality. In the past century IAV induced several world-wide pandemics, the most aggressive occurring in 1918 with a death toll of 20-50 million cases. However, infection with IAV alone is rarely fatal. Instead, death associated with IAV is usually mediated by superinfection with bacteria, mainly Streptococcus pneumoniae. The reasons for this increased susceptibility to bacterial superinfection have not been fully elucidated. We previously demonstrated that triggering of TLR7 causes immune incompetence in mice by induction of lymphopenia. IAV is recognized by TLR7 and infections can lead to lymphopenia. Since lymphocytes are critical to protect from S. pneumoniae it has long been speculated that IAV-induced lymphopenia might mediate increased susceptibility to superinfection. Here we show that sub-lethal pre-infections of mice with IAV-PR8/A/34 strongly increased their mortality in non-lethal SP infections, surprisingly despite the absence of detectable lymphopenia. In contrast to SP-infection alone co-infected animals were unable to control the exponential growth of SP. However, lymphopenia forced by TLR7-triggering or antibody-mediated neutropenia did not increase SP-susceptibility or compromise the ability to control SP growth. Thus, the immune-incompetence caused by transient lympho- or leukopenia is not sufficient to inhibit potent antibacterial responses of the host and mechanisms distinct from leukodepletion must account for increased bacterial superinfection during viral defence."
https://openalex.org/W2011412709,"The mechanism of lamellipod actin turnover is still under debate. To clarify the intracellular behavior of the recently-identified actin disruption mechanism, we examined kinetics of AIP1 using fluorescent single-molecule speckle microscopy. AIP1 is thought to cap cofilin-generated actin barbed ends. Here we demonstrate a reduction in actin-associated AIP1 in lamellipodia of cells overexpressing LIM-kinase. Moreover, actin-associated AIP1 was rapidly abolished by jasplakinolide, which concurrently blocked the F-actin-cofilin interaction. Jasplakinolide also slowed dissociation of AIP1, which is analogous to the effect of this drug on capping protein. These findings provide in vivo evidence of the association of AIP1 with barbed ends generated by cofilin-catalyzed filament disruption. Single-molecule observation found distribution of F-actin-associated AIP1 throughout lamellipodia, and revealed even faster dissociation of AIP1 than capping protein. The estimated overall AIP1-associated actin disruption rate, 1.8 µM/s, was one order of magnitude faster than Arp2/3 complex-catalyzed actin nucleation in lamellipodia. This rate does not suffice the filament severing rate predicted in our previous high frequency filament severing-annealing hypothesis. Our data together with recent biochemical studies imply barbed end-preferred frequent filament disruption. Frequent generation of AIP1-associated barbed ends and subsequent release of AIP1 may be the mechanism that facilitates previously observed ubiquitous actin polymerization throughout lamellipodia."

LDS, 10R-DOX, PGHS, and α-DOX oxygenate fatty acids to different products, but their oxygenation mechanisms have mechanistic similarities. Sequence alignment shows that many critical amino acid residues for the cyclooxygenase reaction are conserved in LDS, 10R-DOX, and α-DOX. These include the proximal histidine heme ligand, the distal histidine, and the catalytic important tyrosine (Tyr-385) of PGHS-1. The latter is oxidized to a tyrosyl radical, which initiates the cyclooxygenase reaction by abstraction of the pro-S hydrogen at C-13 of 20:4n-6 (16Tsai A. Hsi L.C. Kulmacz R.J. Palmer G. Smith W.L.

Homologous genes can be found in other Aspergilli spp. Alignment of the two 7,8-LDS amino acid sequences with 5,8-LDS, 8,11-LDS, and 10R-DOX sequences of five Aspergilli revealed several conserved regions with single amino acid differences between the enzymes with 8R-DOX and 10R-DOX activities, as illustrated by the selected sequences in Fig. 1. Leu-306, Leu-384, and Val-388 of 10R-DOX are replaced in 5,8- and 7,8-LDS by valine, valine, and leucine residues, respectively. Whether these amino acids are important for the oxygenation mechanism is unknown, and this is one topic of the present investigation. The predicted secondary structure of 10R-DOX suggests that Leu-384 of 10R-DOX can be present in an α-helix with Val-388 close to its border. This α-helix is homologous to helix 6 of PGHS-1, which contains Val-349 and Ser-353 at the homologous positions of Leu-384 and Val-388 (Fig. 1). The overall three-dimensional structures of myeloperoxidases are conserved. It is therefore conceivable that important residues for substrate binding in the cyclooxygenase channel of PGHS could be conserved in LDS and 10R-DOX. The three-dimensional structure of ovine PGHS-1 shows that Val-349 and Ser-353 are close to C-3 and C-4 of 20:4n-6, and residues in these positions can alter both position and stereospecificity of oxygenation (22Schneider C.

There is little information on the hydroperoxide isomerase and peroxidase sites of LDS (18Garscha U. Oliw E.H. FEBS Lett. 2008; 582: 3547-3551Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 26Garscha U. Oliw E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2008; 373: 579-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), but the latter could be structurally related to the peroxidase site of PGHS. PGG2 and presumably 8R-HPODE bind to the distal side of the heme group, which can be delineated by hydrophobic amino acid residues (27Liu J. Seibold S.A. Rieke C.J. Song I. Cukier R.I. Smith W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 18233-18244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Val-291 is one of these residues, which form a dome over the distal heme side of COX-1. The V291A mutant retained cyclooxygenase and peroxidase activities (27Liu J. Seibold S.A. Rieke C.J. Song I. Cukier R.I. Smith W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 18233-18244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). 5,8- and 7,8-LDS also have valine residues in the homologous position, whereas 8,11-LDS and 10R-DOX have leucine residues (Fig. 1). Whether these hydrophobic residues are important for the peroxidase activities is unknown. In this study we decided to compare the two catalytic sites of 10R-DOX of A. fumigatus and 7,8-LDS (EC 1.13.11.44) of G. graminis (18Garscha U. Oliw E.H. FEBS Lett. 2008; 582: 3547-3551Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Our first aim was to find a robust expression system for 10R-DOX of A. fumigatus. The second objective was to determine whether C16 and C20 fatty acid substrates enter the oxygenation site of 10R-DOX “head” or “tail” first. Unexpectedly, we found that 10R-DOX oxygenated 20:4n-6 by hydrogen abstraction at both C-13 and C-10 with formation of two nonconjugated and four cis-trans-conjugated HPETEs. Our third objective was to investigate the structural differences between 10R-DOX and 7,8-LDS of G. graminis, which could explain that oxygenation of 18:2n-6 mainly occurred at C-10 and at C-8, respectively. The strategy for site-directed mutagenesis of 10R-DOX and 7,8-LDS is outlined in the legend to Fig. 1; an alignment of the amino acid sequences of 10R-DOX and 7,8-LDS is found in supplemental material.

Gentamycin sulfate and Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf21) cells were obtained locally. Primers for site-directed mutagenesis were obtained from TIB Molbiol (Berlin, Germany), and other oligonucleotides were from CyberGene (Huddinge, Sweden). Sequencing was performed at Uppsala Genomic Center (Rudbeck Laboratories, Uppsala University). 10R-HODE was isolated from incubations of mycelia of Aspergilli (3Garscha U. Jerneren F. Chung D. Keller N.P. Hamberg M. Oliw E.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 34707-34718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) and 8R-HODE from incubations with M. grisea (21Cristea M. Osbourn A.E. Oliw E.H. Lipids. 2003; 38: 1275-1280Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar); the alcohols were purified by TLC as described (28Garscha U. Oliw E.H. Anal. Biochem. 2007; 367: 238-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Racemic vernolic acid was obtained by epoxidation of 18:2n-6 with mCPBA (1.5 eq) in CH2Cl2 (29Oliw E.H. J. Chromatogr. 1983; 275: 245-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), purified by TLC (ethyl acetate/hexane, 1:1), and analyzed by LC-MS/MS. 10R-HODE and 8R-HODE were also oxidized with mCPBA, and the products were analyzed by LC-MS/MS. [8R-2H]18:2n-6 was synthesized as described (3Garscha U. Jerneren F. Chung D. Keller N.P. Hamberg M. Oliw E.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 34707-34718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). R and S stereoisomers of 12-, 11-, and 8-HETE were from Cayman. [2H8]15S-HETE and [2H4]13S-HPODE were prepared with soybean lipoxygenase (lipoxidase, type IV; Sigma), and 13R-HPODE, 13S-HPETE, and 15R-HPETE with manganese lipoxygenase (30Cristea M. Oliw E.H. J. Lipid Res. 2007; 48: 890-903Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) (supplemental material). Cloning and Expression—Total RNA was isolated from nitrogen powder of A. fumigatus (Fres.), which was suspended in phenol (1 volume), and 0.1 m LiCl, 0.1 m Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 10 mm EDTA, 1% SDS (1 volume), 4 m LiCl (1 volume) was added to aqueous phase, which was stored overnight at 4 °C. RNA was precipitated by centrifugation and purified by phenol/chloroform extraction. cDNA was generated by the enhanced avian RT-PCR kit (8Hörnsten L. Su C. Osbourn A.E. Garosi P. Hellman U. Wernstedt C. Oliw E.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28219-28224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The cDNA of 10R-DOX was amplified by PCR in two partly overlapping fragments of 1447 bp (nucleotides 1-1443) and 2055 bp (nucleotides 1298-3366), respectively, covering the entire reading frame, using Phusion® DNA polymerase and two pairs of primers (forward 5′-cataatgttgcggaggttctc and reverse 5′-gaacgtgcgcttggatggatc, and forward 5′-ctagcgccaccgatgagaaatg and reverse 5′-gcttaggcatcgtactggacac). The fragments were ligated into pJET1/blunt (pJET1_10-DOX-(1-1443); pJET_10-DOX-(1298-3366)). A KpnI restriction site was introduced (ggtaccataATG) by PCR technology into pJET1_10-DOX-(1-1443). The two fragments were ligated sequentially (KpnI-BamHI and BamHI-XbaI) in pIZ/V5-His (generating pIZ_10-DOX). The stop codon was removed by site-directed mutagenesis so that the His tag of the expression plasmid came in-frame with expressed protein (yielding pIZ/V5-His_10-DOX); both plasmids were used for expression. The expression vector for 7,8-LDS, pIZ/V5-His_LDS, was described previously (26Garscha U. Oliw E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2008; 373: 579-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Site-directed Mutagenesis—Site-directed mutagenesis of pIZ_10-DOX and pIZ/V5-His_LDS was performed with Pfu DNA polymerase and oligonucleotides of 44-46 bases (supplemental Table 2S), as described by the QuikChange manual (Stratagene) with minor modifications (31Cristea M. Engström Å. Su C. Hörnsten L. Oliw E.H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2005; 434: 201-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). All constructs were confirmed by sequencing. Expression of 10R-DOX, 7,8-LDS, and Their Mutants in Insect Cells—Plasmid-driven expression was performed by transfection of Sf21 cells with pIZ_10-DOX, pIZ/V5-His_10-DOX, and pIZ/V5-His_LDS, using Cellfectin as described (26Garscha U. Oliw E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2008; 373: 579-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Cells were harvested after 48 h, suspended in lysis buffer (50 mm KHPO4 (pH 7.4), 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm GSH, 5% glycerol, 0.04% Tween 20), and sonicated (Branson Sonifier cell disrupter B15, maximum power 20%, three times with 5-s pulses at 4 °C). The cell debris was spun down (15,000 × g, 30 min; 4 °C), and the supernatant was used for enzyme assay. Expression of proteins with His tags was detected by Western blot analysis (26Garscha U. Oliw E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2008; 373: 579-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Enzyme Assay—Recombinant 10R-DOX, 7,8-LDS, and their mutants were incubated with 100 μm of unsaturated fatty acids for 30 min on ice. The reaction (0.2-0.5 ml) was terminated with ethanol (3-4 volumes), and an internal standard was added in some experiments, and proteins were precipitated by centrifugation. The metabolites were extracted on octadecyl silica (SepPak/C18), evaporated to dryness, and diluted in the mobile phase or methanol (20-40 μl), and 5-10 μl was subject to LC-MS/MS analysis. TPP was used to reduce hydroperoxides to alcohols. Oxygenation rates of 100 μm fatty acids by 10R-DOX and kinetic parameters of 18:2n-6 were determined in triplicate by LC-MS/MS (supplemental material). HPLC-MS/MS Analysis—A multiple-stage linear ion trap mass spectrometer (LTQ, ThermoFisher) with the Surveyor MS pump and Surveyor autosampler was used with electrospray ionization and monitoring of negative ions. The electrospray needle was set at 4.5 kV; the temperature of the heated capillary was 315 °C, and PGF1α was used for tuning. Data were analyzed by the Xcalibur software. The RP-HPLC column contained octadecyl silica (5-μm, 150 × 2 mm) and was eluted with methanol/water/acetic acid, 80:20:0.01 or 75:25:0.01, at 0.3 ml/min (3Garscha U. Jerneren F. Chung D. Keller N.P.

Biochem. 2007; 367: 238-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). For quantification we used the ratio of signal intensities of the carboxylate anions of the products and the internal standard ([2H4]13-HODE or [2H8]15-HETE) and measured the area under the peaks from experiments done in triplicate. Epoxyalcohols and hydroxy fatty acids were separated on NP-HPLC (isopropyl alcohol/hexane/acetic acid, 3:97:0.02 and 2:98:0.02, respectively) at 0.5 ml/min, and the column effluent was mixed in a T junction with isopropyl alcohol/water, 3:2, at 0.3 ml/min, for MS/MS analysis (32Oliw E.H. Garscha U. Nilsson T. Cristea M. Anal. Biochem. 2006; 354: 111-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). CP-HPLC-MS/MS analysis of 8-HODE and 8-, 11-, 12-, 13-, and 15-HETE was performed with Chiralcel® OB-H (250 × 4.6 mm; Daicel Chemical Industries, Ltd.; isopropyl alcohol/hexane/acetic acid, 5:95:0.01 (cf. Ref. 28Garscha U. Oliw E.H. Anal. Biochem. 2007; 367: 238-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). 10-HODE and 10-HETE were analyzed using Reprosil Chiral-NR (250 × 2 mm; 1.2-3% isopropyl alcohol in hexane with 0.01% acetic acid) (28Garscha U. Oliw E.H. Anal. Biochem. 2007; 367: 238-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). 10-HETE and 13-HETE were also analyzed on Chiralcel OD-H (250 × 4.6 mm; isopropyl alcohol, hexane, 0.01% acetic acid, 95:5:0.01), as the elution orders of the enantiomers are known on this column (33Brash A.R. Boeglin W.E. Capdevila J.H. Yeola S. Blair I.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 321: 485-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Finally, stereoisomers of HODE and HETE were also resolved on amylose tris(3,5-dimethylphenylcarbonate) coated on silica (10 μm; 2 × 250 mm; Reprosil Chiral-AM) eluted at 0.15 ml/min with hexane/ethanol/acetic acid, 95:5:0.02. Expression of 10R-DOX—The predicted sequence of 10R-DOX of A. fumigatus from genome analysis is available at GenBank™ (accession number XM_749316). We cloned 10R-DOX by RT-PCR and sequenced 3366 bp (GenBank™ accession number ACL14177). A comparison with the predicted gene sequence confirmed 13 exons and 12 short introns (supplemental material). Recombinant 10R-DOX was successfully expressed in insect cells (Sf21) using the plasmid-driven expression method. Two different constructs were utilized, one with the native stop codon (pIZ_10-DOX) and one without but with 34 additional C-terminal amino acids (V5 epitope and His6 tag; pIZ/V5His_10-DOX; see supplemental material). Both recombinant enzymes appeared to oxygenate 18:2n-6 to the same products, as described below. Expression of 10R-DOX with the His tag was confirmed by Western blot analysis (Fig. 2). Low speed supernatant of untransformed Sf21 cells did not convert 18:2n-6 to any of these metabolites, and we could therefore use the 10R-DOX activity as evidence of enzyme induction. Substrate and Product Specificity of 10R-DOX—The natural substrates of 10R-DOX and LDS are likely C18 fatty acids (34Tsitsigiannis D.I. Keller N.P. Trends Microbiol. 2007; 15: 109-118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Recombinant 10R-DOX metabolized 18:2n-6 mainly to 10R-HODE (89.6%) and to 8R-HODE (10.4 ± 2.0% (S.D.), n = 11), as judged from LC-MS analysis. Incubation with [(8R)-2H]18:2-6 confirmed pro-S hydrogen abstraction at C-8, as described for native 10R-DOX (3Garscha U. Jerneren F. Chung D. Keller N.P. Hamberg M. Oliw E.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 34707-34718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) (data not shown). In addition, ODA (3Garscha U. Jerneren F. Chung D. Keller N.P. Hamberg M. Oliw E.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 34707-34718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) and small amounts of epoxyalcohols were formed, as described below. 18:3n-3 (n = 6) was oxidized to the same profile of metabolites as 18:2n-6 (91% 10-hydroxyoctadeca-8E,12Z,15Z-trienoic acid and 9% 8-hydroxyoctadeca-9Z,12Z,15Z-trienoic acid). The 12-13 double bonds of 18:2n-6 and 18:3n-3 appeared to be essential for the oxygenation at C-10, as 18:1n-9 (n = 4) was mainly oxidized at C-8 (96%) and only to small amounts of 10-hydroxyoctadecenoic acid. The oxidation of 100 μm 18:2n-6 was linear for at least 30 min on ice. The apparent Km was 0.05 mm, as judged from triplicate LC-MS analysis with [2H8]15S-HETE as an internal standard with monitoring of the area under the carboxylate anions of the reconstructed ion chromatograms (supplemental material). By this method, 100 μm 18:3n-3 (n = 3) was found to be oxidized as rapidly as 100 μm 18:2n-6 (n = 3). 18:1n-9 (n = 2) was oxidized at a rate of ∼40% of 18:2n-6. Metabolites of 18:3n-6 could not be detected. We next examined whether fatty acids are bound tail or head first to the active site, as this is important information for comparison with 7,8-LDS and PGHS. The results are summarized in Table 1. Both 16:1n-7 and C20 fatty acids were oxygenated by 10R-DOX in agreement with a tail first model. The double bonds of C18 and C20 fatty acids influenced the relative oxygenation at C-8/C-10 and C-10/C-12, respectively (Table 1). 20:3n-3 (n = 2) was mainly oxidized at C-10 (n-11) and 20:4n-6 (n = 6) and at C-12 (n-9), whereas 20:2n-6 (n = 2) was oxidized equally at C-10 (n-11) and C-12 (n-9).TABLE 1Oxidation of unsaturated fatty acids and vernolic acids at the n-9 and n-11 positions by recombinant 10R-DOXSubstrates"
https://openalex.org/W2063275638,"Background Type 1 diabetes mellitus is caused by immune-mediated destruction of pancreatic β-cells leading to insulin deficiency, impaired intermediary metabolism, and elevated blood glucose concentrations. While at autoimmune diabetes onset a limited number of β-cells persist, the cells' regenerative potential and its regulation have remained largely unexplored. Using two mouse autoimmune diabetes models, this study examined the proliferation of pancreatic islet ß-cells and other endocrine and non-endocrine subsets, and the factors regulating that proliferation. Methodology and Principal Findings We adapted multi-parameter flow cytometry techniques (including DNA-content measurements and 5′-bromo-2′-deoxyuridine [BrdU] incorporation) to study pancreatic islet single cell suspensions. These studies demonstrate that β-cell proliferation rapidly increases at diabetes onset, and that this proliferation is closely correlated with the diabetic animals' elevated blood glucose levels. For instance, we show that when normoglycemia is restored by exogenous insulin or islet transplantation, the β-cell proliferation rate returns towards low levels found in control animals, yet surges when hyperglycemia recurs. In contrast, other-than-ß endocrine islet cells did not exhibit the same glucose-dependent proliferative responses. Rather, disease-associated alterations of BrdU-incorporation rates of δ-cells (minor decrease), and non-endocrine islet cells (slight increase) were not affected by blood glucose levels, or were inversely related to glycemia control after diabetes onset (α-cells). Conclusion We conclude that murine β-cells' ability to proliferate in response to metabolic need (i.e. rising blood glucose concentrations) is remarkably well preserved during severe, chronic β-cell autoimmunity. These data suggest that timely control of the destructive immune response after disease manifestation could allow spontaneous regeneration of sufficient β-cell mass to restore normal glucose homeostasis."
https://openalex.org/W2164065158,"Background Whole-genome association studies in humans have enabled the unbiased discovery of new genes associated with human memory performance. However, such studies do not allow for a functional or causal testing of newly identified candidate genes. Since polymorphisms in Calsyntenin 2 (CLSTN2) showed a significant association with episodic memory performance in humans, we tested the C. elegans CLSTN2 ortholog CASY-1 for possible functions in the associative behavior of C. elegans. Methodology/Principal Findings Using three different associative learning paradigms and functional rescue experiments, we show that CASY-1 plays an important role during associative learning in C. elegans. Furthermore, neuronal expression of human CLSTN2 in C. elegans rescues the learning defects of casy-1 mutants. Finally, genetic interaction studies and neuron-specific expression experiments suggest that CASY-1 may regulate AMPA-like GLR-1 glutamate receptor signaling. Conclusion/Significance Our experiments demonstrate a remarkable conservation of the molecular function of Calsyntenins between nematodes and humans and point at a role of C. elegans casy-1 in regulating a glutamate receptor signaling pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2123047484,"Carnitine is an essential metabolite that enables intracellular transport of fatty acids and acetyl units. Here we show that the yeast Candida albicans can synthesize carnitine de novo, and we identify the 4 genes of the pathway. Null mutants of orf19.4316 (trimethyllysine dioxygenase), orf19.6306 (trimethylaminobutyraldehyde dehydrogenase), and orf19.7131 (butyrobetaine dioxygenase) lacked their respective enzymatic activities and were unable to utilize fatty acids, acetate, or ethanol as a sole carbon source, in accordance with the strict requirement for carnitine-mediated transport under these growth conditions. The second enzyme of carnitine biosynthesis, hydroxytrimethyllysine aldolase, is encoded by orf19.6305, a member of the threonine aldolase (TA) family in C. albicans. A strain lacking orf19.6305 showed strongly reduced growth on fatty acids and was unable to utilize either acetate or ethanol, but TA activity was unaffected. Growth of the null mutants on nonfermentable carbon sources is restored only by carnitine biosynthesis intermediates after the predicted enzymatic block in the pathway, which provides independent evidence for a specific defect in carnitine biosynthesis for each of the mutants. In conclusion, we have genetically characterized a complete carnitine biosynthesis pathway in C. albicans and show that a TA family member is mainly involved in the aldolytic cleavage of hydroxytrimethyllysine in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1975827112,"Background Mucociliary clearance in the airways is driven by the coordinated beating of ciliated cells. Classical neuromediators such as noradrenalin and acetylcholine increase ciliary beat frequency and thus cilia-driven transport. Despite the fact that the neuromediator serotonin is ciliostimulatory in invertebrates and has been implied in releasing acetylcholine from the airway epithelium, its role in regulating cilia function in vertebrate airways is not established. Methodology/Principal Findings We examined the effects of serotonin on ciliary beat frequency and cilia-driven particle transport in the acutely excised submerged mouse trachea and determined the sources of serotonin in this tissue by immunohistochemistry. Serotonin (100 µM) increased cilary beat frequency (8.9±1.2 Hz to 17.0±2.7 Hz) and particle transport speed (38.9±4.6 µm/s to 83.4±8.3 µm/s) to an extent that was comparable to a supramaximal dose of ATP. The increase in particle transport speed was totally prevented by methysergide (100 µM). Blockade of muscarinic receptors by atropine (1 µM) did not reduce the effect of serotonin, although it was effective in preventing the increase in particle transport speed mediated by muscarine (100 µM). Immunohistochemistry demonstrated serotonin in mast cells pointing towards mast cells and platelets as possible endogenous sources of serotonin. Conclusions/Significance These results indicate that serotonin is a likely endogenous mediator that can increase cilia-driven transport independent from acetylcholine during activation of mast cells and platelets."

https://openalex.org/W2055012025,"Background Spontaneous thought processes (STPs), also called daydreaming or mind-wandering, occur ubiquitously in daily life. However, the functional significance of STPs remains largely unknown. Methodology/Principal Finding Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we first identified an STPs-network whose activity was positively correlated with the subjects' tendency of having STPs during a task-free state. The STPs-network was then found to be strongly associated with the default network, which has previously been established as being active during the task-free state. Interestingly, we found that offline reprocessing of previously memorized information further increased the activity of the STPs-network regions, although during a state with less STPs. In addition, we found that the STPs-network kept a dynamic balance between functional integration and functional separation among its component regions to execute offline memory reprocessing in STPs. Conclusion/Significance These findings strengthen a view that offline memory reprocessing and STPs share the brain's default network, and thus implicate that offline memory reprocessing may be a predetermined function of STPs. This supports the perspective that memory can be consolidated and modified during STPs, and thus gives rise to a dynamic behavior dependent on both previous external and internal experiences."
https://openalex.org/W2048240741,"Nucleophosmin (NPM1) is a ubiquitously expressed protein and is one of the most abundant proteins found in the nucleolus. Naturally occurring mutations in the C-terminal domain of nucleophosmin (Cter-NPM1) are found in approximately 30% of patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). These mutations cause changes at the C terminus of NPM1 that lead to denaturation of the protein, a critical factor in determining aberrant translocation of NPM1 to the cytosol. Hence, this protein system represents an ideal candidate to investigate the relations between folding and unfolding and disease. Here we report the characterization of the folding and unfolding kinetics of Cter-NPM1. Data reveal that this small helical domain folds via a compact denatured state, displaying a malleable residual structure. Moreover, analysis of folding rate constants measured under different experimental conditions suggests that the existence of a preorganized structure in the denatured state accelerates folding, implying a native-like residual structure. Because a major feature of Cter-NPM1 mutants responsible for AML is a reduction in stability of the protein and thus prevalence of a denatured state even under physiological conditions, our findings may pave the way to further studies with the aim of designing chemicals capable of interacting with the ""pathological"" mutants to stabilize the native conformation."
https://openalex.org/W2064147220,"A delicate balance between cell death and survival pathways maintains normal physiology, which is altered in many cancers, shifting the balance toward increased survival. Several studies have established a close connection between the Wnt/β-catenin pathway and tumorigenesis, aberrant activation of which might contribute toward increased cancer cell growth and survival. Extensive research is underway to identify therapeutic agents that can induce apoptosis specifically in cancer cells with minimal collateral damage to normal cells. Although tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) can induce apoptosis specifically in tumor cells, many cancer cells develop resistance, which can be overcome by combinatorial treatment with other agents: for example, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptorγ (PPARγ) ligands. To identify the molecular target mediating combinatorial drug-induced apoptosis, we focused on β-catenin, a protein implicated in oncogenesis. Our results show that co-treatment of TRAIL-resistant cancer cells with TRAIL and the PPARγ ligand troglitazone leads to a reduction ofβ-catenin expression, coinciding with maximal apoptosis. Modulation of β-catenin levels via ectopic overexpression or small interference RNA-mediated gene silencing modulates drug-induced apoptosis, indicating involvement of β-catenin in regulating this pathway. More in-depth studies indicated a post-translational mechanism, independent of glycogen synthase kinase-3β activity regulating β-catenin expression following combinatorial drug treatment. Furthermore, TRAIL- and troglitazone-induced apoptosis was preceded by a cleavage of β-catenin, which was complete in a fully apoptotic population, and was mediated by caspases-3 and -8. These results demonstrate β-catenin as a promising new target of drug-induced apoptosis, which can be targeted to sensitize apoptosis-resistant cancer cells.

Furthermore, TRAIL- and troglitazone-induced apoptosis was preceded by a cleavage of β-catenin, which was complete in a fully apoptotic population, and was mediated by caspases-3 and -8. These results demonstrate β-catenin as a promising new target of drug-induced apoptosis, which can be targeted to sensitize apoptosis-resistant cancer cells. Apoptosis is a form of cell death that permits the removal of damaged, senescent, or unwanted cells in multicellular organisms, without damage to the cellular microenvironment. Alterations of cellular machinery that lead to inactivation or evasion of apoptosis represents a major causative factor in the development and progression of cancer. Therapeutic approaches that can restore cancer cell apoptosis are expected to provide an effective means of treating various forms of cancer.

Pai R.C. Fong S. Leung S. Lawrence D.A. Marsters S.A. Blackie C. Chang L. McMurtrey A.E. Hebert A. DeForge L. Koumenis I.L. Lewis D. Harris L. Bussiere J. Koeppen H. Shahrokh Z. Schwall R.H. J. Clin.

TRAIL belongs to the tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) superfamily of cytokines, which include TNFα and Fas ligand (FasL)/CD95L all of which function via binding to their corresponding death receptors (3Fesik S.W. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2005; 5: 876-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (946) Google Scholar) leading to activation of caspases (4Ashkenazi A. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 420-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (1111) Google Scholar). Stimulation by TRAIL leads to its binding to death receptors DR4 and DR5, resulting in activation of initiator caspases (caspases-8 and -10), executioner caspase (caspase-3) (5Sprick M.R.

Activated caspase-8 can also amplify death signal via an intrinsic pathway, through cleavage of proapoptotic BID resulting in its translocation to the mitochondria and release of cytochrome c in the cytoplasm. Cytochrome c in the presence of dATP and apoptotic protease-activating factor 1 activates caspase-9, which in turn activates caspase-3 further leading to more apoptosis (7Kelley S.K. Ashkenazi A. Curr. Opin. Pharmacol. 2004; 4: 333-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). Results from preclinical studies with recombinant TRAIL have demonstrated its significant anti-tumor activities, indicating the potential of utilizing TRAIL as an anticancer agent (8Bonavida B. Ng C.P. Jazirehi A. Schiller G. Mizutani Y. Int. J. Oncol. 1999; 15: 793-802PubMed Google Scholar). Despite this proapoptotic role of TRAIL in the transformed cells, many cancer cells develop resistance toward TRAIL-induced apoptosis (9Chinnaiyan A.M. Prasad U. Shankar S. Hamstra D.A. Shanaiah M. Chenevert T.L. Ross B.D. Rehemtulla A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1754-1759Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar, 10LeBlanc H. Lawrence D. Varfolomeev E. Totpal K. Morlan J. Schow P. Fong S. Schwall R. Sinicropi D. Ashkenazi A. Nat. Med. 2002; 8: 274-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar). One potential reason for this resistance could be due to the presence of non-signaling decoy receptors for TRAIL, DcR1, DcR2 (11Ashkenazi A. Dixit V.M. Science. 1998; 281: 1305-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (5169) Google Scholar), and osteoprotegerin (12Emery J.G. McDonnell P. Burke M.B. Deen K.C. Lyn S. Silverman C. Dul E. Appelbaum E.R. Eichman C.

Sensitivity of the tumor cells toward TRAIL-mediated apoptosis have also been linked with the activity of various pro- and anti-apoptotic proteins (10LeBlanc H. Lawrence D. Varfolomeev E. Totpal K.

Valentine V.A. Behm F.G. Look A.T. Lahti J.M. Kidd V.J. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 529-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (702) Google Scholar). Identification of drugs or agents that can overcome TRAIL resistance and sensitize cancer cells toward TRAIL-induced apoptosis is thus critically important for targeting TRAIL-resistant cancer cells. In earlier studies, a combination of TRAIL with radiation and some chemotherapeutic agents (9Chinnaiyan A.M. Prasad U. Shankar S. Hamstra D.A. Shanaiah M. Chenevert T.L. Ross B.D. Rehemtulla A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1754-1759Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar, 15Keane M.M. Ettenberg S.A. Nau M.M. Russell E.K. Lipkowitz S. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 734-741PubMed Google Scholar) have provided limited success, because this combination also resulted in an increase in systemic toxicity. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) belongs to the nuclear receptor superfamily, which is involved in regulating various cellular processes including proliferation and apoptosis (16Kliewer S.A. Sundseth S.S. Jones S.A. Brown P.J. Wisely G.B. Koble C.S. Devchand P. Wahli W. Willson T.M. Lenhard J.M. Lehmann J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4318-4323Crossref PubMed Scopus (1898) Google Scholar). Multiple artificial ligands of PPARγ have been reported so far, which belong to the thiazolidinedione family of insulin sensitizers and include troglitazone (TZD), ciglitazone, pioglitazone, and rosiglitazone. Our earlier studies have demonstrated that TZD can induce cell cycle arrest in proliferating liver cells, via targeting cell cycle regulators (17Sharma C. Pradeep A. Pestell R.G. Rana B. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 16927-16938Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). At high doses these ligands can inhibit tumor growth in vivo via regulating cellular proliferation and apoptosis (18Sarraf P. Mueller E. Jones D. King F.J. DeAngelo D.J. Partridge J.B. Holden S.A.

Malfertheiner P. Farrell G.C. Hepatology. 2006; 43: 134-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). More recent studies have also demonstrated that PPARγ ligands can sensitize various cancer cells toward TRAIL-induced apoptosis (13Kim Y. Suh N. Sporn M. Reed J.C. J. Biol.

Apoptosis. 2006; 11: 1503-1512Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) thus raising the possibility of utilizing the TRAIL-PPARγ ligand combination for treating cancer cells. However, the detailed mechanism how this drug combination increases TRAIL sensitivity in TRAIL-resistant cancer cells is still unclear. Although one study demonstrates the cell cycle regulator cyclin D3 as a target of TRAIL-PPARγ agonist-mediated apoptosis (21Lu M. Kwan T. Yu C. Chen F. Freedman B. Schafer J.M. Lee E.J. Jameson J.L.

Croxton R. Krajewska M. Krajewski S. Kress C.L. Lu M. Suh N. Sporn M.B. Cryns V.L. Zapata J.M. Reed J.C. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 4799-4808Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 23Zou W. Liu X.

Apoptosis. 2006; 11: 1503-1512Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Identification of molecular effectors, which can be targeted to increase TRAIL sensitivity in resistant cancer cells, is an important first step toward the development of effective therapeutic approaches. In an attempt to identify additional targets contributing toward TRAIL resistance in the cancer cells, we focused on β-catenin due to a close link of β-catenin activation with cancer pathways (25Bienz M. Clevers H. Cell. 2000; 103: 311-320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1310) Google Scholar, 26Nhieu J.T. Renard C.A. Wei Y. Cherqui D. Zafrani E.S. Buendia M.A. Am. J. Pathol. 1999; 155: 703-710Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recent studies have also established a connection of β-catenin in mediating cell survival (27Zeng G. Apte U. Cieply B. Singh S. Monga S.P. Neoplasia. 2007; 9: 951-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 28Tan X. Yuan Y. Zeng G. Apte U. Thompson M.D. Cieply B. Stolz D.B. Michalopoulos G.K. Kaestner K.H. Monga S.P. Hepatology. 2008; 47: 1667-1679Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). β-Catenin is a multifunctional protein, the expression of which is tightly regulated in normal cells and aberrant activation of which can lead to tumorigenesis (25Bienz M. Clevers H. Cell. 2000; 103: 311-320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1310) Google Scholar). In the conventional pathway of β-catenin degradation, the serine threonine kinase glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β) in the presence of axin and functionally active adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) phosphorylates specific N-terminal residues of β-catenin and targets it toward degradation (29Rubinfeld B. Albert I. Porfiri E. Fiol C. Munemitsu S. Polakis P. Science. 1996; 272: 1023-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (1310) Google Scholar). Mutations of either APC or β-catenin itself (30de La Coste A.

Cell. 2000; 103: 311-320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1310) Google Scholar) can lead to inhibition of β-catenin degradation, resulting in increased cytoplasmic pools of β-catenin. Other pathways of β-catenin degradation have also been reported recently (32Matsuzawa S.I. Reed J.C. Mol.

Stabilization of β-catenin results in its translocation into the nucleus, interaction with transcription factors of the T cell factor/lymphoid enhancer factor (TCF/LEF) family to activate target gene transcription (25Bienz M. Clevers H. Cell. 2000; 103: 311-320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1310) Google Scholar). A significant percentage of the human and mouse liver tumors harbor oncogenic mutations of the β-catenin gene (30de La Coste A. Romagnolo B. Billuart P. Renard C.A. Buendia M.A. Soubrane O. Fabre M.

Cell. 1996; 87: 159-170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4286) Google Scholar). In the present study we determined whether combinatorial treatment with TRAIL and TZD induces apoptosis in TRAIL-resistant cancer cells via targeting β-catenin. Our studies indicate that TRAIL- and TZD-mediated apoptosis is associated with a dramatic reduction of full-length β-catenin expression, coinciding with the degree of apoptosis. Ectopic overexpression of β-catenin antagonizes this drug-induced apoptosis, whereas small interference RNA (siRNA)-mediated knock-down of endogenous β-catenin initiates spontaneous apoptosis in cancer cells. TRAIL-TZD-mediated attenuation of β-catenin expression involved a GSK3β independent post-translational mechanism. Reduction of full-length β-catenin expression was also associated with a cleavage of C-terminal β-catenin mediated by caspases-3 and -8. These results indicate the promising possibility of targeting β-catenin as an effective means of overcoming TRAIL resistance. Reagents—Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, RPMI, McCoy's 5A tissue culture media, geneticin sulfate, and Lipofectamine 2000 were purchased from Invitrogen; troglitazone, TRAIL, cycloheximide, Z-VAD-fmk, Z-DEVD-fmk, IEDT-fmk, MG-132, lactacystin, and GSK3β inhibitor VIII (AR-A014418) were purchased from Calbiochem; the ELISAPLUS kit and in situ Cell Death Detection Kit (fluorescein) were purchased from Roche Applied Sciences; and 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride (DAPI) was from Vector Laboratories (Burlingame, CA). The antibodies were obtained from the following sources: poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), caspase-3, cleaved caspase-3, caspase-8, GSK3β, phospho-GSK3βSer9, Akt, and phospho-glycogen synthaseSer641 from Cell Signaling Technology (Danvers, MA); β-catenin from Zymed Laboratories Inc., Invitrogen, and BD Biosciences (San Jose, CA); glycogen synthase from Invitrogen; cyclin-D1 from Neomarkers (Fremont, CA); Bcl-xL from Exalpha Biologicals Inc. (Watertown, MA); GAPDH from Ambion Inc. (Austin, TX). The Huh-7 cells were obtained from Dr. Robert E. Lanford (University of Texas Health Science Center, San Antonio, TX) (38Sureau C. Moriarty A.M. Thornton G.B. Lanford R.E. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 1241-1245Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and the RKO and RKO-β-catenin cells were obtained from Dr. Wallace K. MacNaughton and Hongying Wang (University of Calgary, Calgary, Canada) (39Wang H. MacNaughton W.K. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 8604-8607Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The LNCaP and SKOV3 cells were obtained commercially from ATCC. The wild type (WT) and GSK3β knock-out (-/-) mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) were obtained from Dr. James R. Woodgett (University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada) (40Hoeflich K.P. Luo J. Rubie E.A. Tsao M.S. Jin O. Woodgett J.R. Nature. 2000; 406: 86-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (1228) Google Scholar). Cell Culture—Huh-7 and RKO cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's/F-12 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and RKO-β-catenin cells were maintained in a similar medium containing 500 μg/ml Geneticin. LNCaP cells were maintained in RPMI containing 10 mm HEPES, 4.5 g/liter glucose, and 10% fetal bovine serum and SKOV3 cells were grown in modified McCoy's 5A medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. WT-GSK3β (+/+) and GSK3β knock-out (-/-) MEFs were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 4.5 g/liter glucose, 4 mm glutamine, and 10% fetal bovine serum. In TRAIL and TZD experiments, cells were treated with 100 ng/ml TRAIL or 50 μm TZD (unless indicated otherwise) alone or in combination for various lengths of time followed by either apoptosis assays or Western blot analysis. In the studies with GSK3β inhibitor (AR-A014418) or caspase inhibitors, cells were pretreated for 1 h with 10 μm AR-A014418 or 50 μm Z-VAD-fmk or 25 μm DEVD-fmk or 25 μm IETD-fmk, respectively, followed by TRAIL-TZD treatment. Apoptosis Detection by Fluorescence Microscopy—This was performed utilizing protocols described earlier (41Barthwal M.K. Sathyanarayana P. Kundu C.N. Rana B. Pradeep A. Sharma C. Woodgett J.R. Rana A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3897-3902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Briefly, subconfluent cells were plated in 2-well chamber slides and were treated with 50 μm TZD and 100 ng/ml TRAIL either alone or in combination. To determine the optimal drug concentrations required to induce maximal apoptosis in cancer cells, increasing concentrations of TZD or TRAIL were utilized in pilot experiments and apoptosis assays were performed. Following treatment with TZD and TRAIL, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% Triton X-100, and stained with DAPI. DAPI-stained nuclei were analyzed for apoptotic morphology by fluorescence microscopy (Axiovert 200 inverted microscope, Zeiss). A minimum of 200 nuclei were analyzed per treatment. The percentage of apoptotic cells was calculated as the number of cells with condensed/fragmented nuclear morphology divided by the total number of cells analyzed. To determine the effect of various agents on apoptotic morphology, cells were also photographed by inverted phase-contrast microscopy. Apoptosis Detection by Cell Death Detection ELISA—This assay was performed utilizing the cell death detection ELISAPLUS kit (Roche Applied Sciences) following the manufacturer's specification as described previously (42Nayak T.K. Norenberg J.P. Anderson T.L. Prossnitz E.R. Stabin M.G. Atcher R.W. Nucl. Med. Biol. 2007; 34: 185-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), with slight modifications. This assay utilizes a quantitative sandwich immunoassay principle to detect and quantitate the mono- and oligonucleosomes specifically released in the cytoplasm during apoptotic cell death. Cells plated on 6-well plates were treated with TZD or TRAIL, following which both adherent and floating (apoptotic) populations were harvested. Cells were lysed in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer and the supernatant was collected following centrifugation at 3000 × g for 10 min. Nucleosomes were detected photometrically at 405 nm in an ELISA plate reader (SpectraMax 190, Molecular Devices) by measuring the peroxidase activity of 2,2′-azino-di(3-ethylbenzthiazolinsulfonate) as substrate. The readings were expressed as degree of apoptosis considering the corresponding untreated control as 1. Apoptosis Detection by TUNEL Assay—Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT)-mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate (dUTP) nick end-labeling (TUNEL) assay was performed utilizing the in situ Cell Death Detection Kit (fluorescein), from Roche Applied Sciences according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, Huh-7 cells plated in 2-well chamber slides were treated with various agents, fixed in freshly prepared 4% paraformaldehyde, and then permeabilized in 0.1% Triton X-100. Cells were then washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and subjected to the TUNEL reaction at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere in the dark for 60 min. At the end of the incubation cells were counterstained with DAPI. The fluorescent signal, emitted by fluorescein-labeled dUTP incorporated into fragmented DNA, was visualized by fluorescence microscopy (Axiovert 200 inverted microscope, Zeiss), interfaced with a camera (Axiocam), and image analyzer software (Axiovision, Zeiss). Small Interference RNA (siRNA)—The β-catenin siRNA oligonucleotides with the sequence (sense 5′-AGCUGAUAUUGAUGGACAG-3′) along with the corresponding antisense oligonucleotide were synthesized from Dharmacon (Lafayette, CO) as described (43Verma U.N. Surabhi R.M. Schmaltieg A. Becerra C. Gaynor R.B. Clin. Cancer Res. 2003; 9: 1291-1300PubMed Google Scholar). A negative control siRNA (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was used as control siRNA. Caspase-8 siRNA was obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA) and caspase-3 siRNA was obtained from Cell Signaling Technology (Danvers, MA). siRNA transfection was performed using Lipofectamine 2000 as per the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, subconfluent Huh-7 cells were plated in 6-well plates in regular growth medium. The next day they were transfected with either 100 nm control siRNA or the target protein siRNA for 24 h followed by recovery in serum containing medium. After 72 h of siRNA transfection, the cells were treated with either DMSO or a combination of TZD and TRAIL for an additional 24 h followed by apoptosis assays. Western Blot Analysis—Western blot analysis was performed following treatment of the cells with various agents and at different time intervals following the procedures described previously (34Sharma C. Pradeep A. Wong L. Rana A. Rana B. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 35583-35594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Equal amounts of total protein were fractionated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, followed by Western blotting with the antibodies indicated. In the studies with cycloheximide, cells were treated with (20 μg/ml) cycloheximide in the presence or absence of TRAIL-TZD for various lengths of time up to a maximum of 8 h. TRAIL and TZD-mediated Apoptosis in Hepatocellular Carcinoma Cells Is Associated with a Reduction of β-Catenin Expression—Earlier studies have reported that combinatorial treatment of TRAIL-resistant cells with TRAIL and PPARγ ligand (21Lu M. Kwan T. Yu C. Chen F. Freedman B. Schafer J.M. Lee E.J. Jameson J.L. Jordan V.C. Cryns V.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 6742-6751Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) sensitizes them toward apoptosis. To identify a specific target mediating this apoptosis, we used the hepatocellular carcinoma cell line Huh-7, because they show resistance to apoptosis when treated with TRAIL alone (44Yamanaka T. Shiraki K. Sugimoto K. Ito T. Fujikawa K. Ito M. Takase K. Moriyama M. Nakano T. Suzuki A. Hepatology. 2000; 32: 482-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Western blot analysis indicated an activation of PARP and caspase-3 (indicated by the presence of the corresponding cleaved fragments) following incubation with the TRAIL and TZD combination (Fig. 1A, fourth lane). Apoptosis assays designed under similar conditions also showed an increase in Huh-7 cell apoptosis with the TRAIL and TZD combination, compared with either agent alone, as shown in Fig. 1C and supplemental Fig. S1A. To gain further insight into the effectors involved in mediating the pathway of apoptosis following combinatorial drug treatment, we estimated changes of β-catenin protein expression following treatment with TRAIL and TZD. Treatment of Huh-7 cells with the TRAIL and TZD combination resulted in a complete loss of β-catenin expression (Fig. 1B, fourth lane), compared with treatment with either drug alone, indicating a possible involvement of β-catenin in this apoptotic pathway. TRAIL and TZD Combination Decrease β-Catenin Expression and Induce Apoptosis in a Time- and Dose-dependent Manner—To establish a correlation between the decrease of β-catenin expression and increase in apoptosis, time course studies with the drug combination were designed next. These indicated that a decrease in β-catenin expression is maximal at 24 h (Fig. 1D), which coincided with maximal apoptosis (Fig. 1E and supplemental Fig. S1B). To determine the optimal concentration of TRAIL and TZD required for maximal β-catenin reduction, Western blot analyses were performed with Huh-7 cell extracts following treatment with increasing concentrations of either TZD or TRAIL. The results indicated that 50–100 μm TZD (Fig. 2A) and 50–100 ng/ml TRAIL (Fig. 2C) were optimal for reducing β-catenin expression maximally. This drug concentration also correlated with apoptosis, which was maximum with 50–100 μm TZD (Fig. 2B and supplemental Fig. S2A), and 100 ng/ml TRAIL (Fig. 2D and supplemental Fig. S2B). Based on these results, the 50 μm TZD and 100 ng/ml TRAIL combination was utilized in all future studies. These results indicated a close correlation between down-regulation of β-catenin expression and induction of apoptosis. TRAIL and TZD-induced Apoptosis Is Associated with Redu"

Previously, we reported that expression of cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) target genes is reduced in the cerebral cortex of presenilin (PS) conditional double knock-out (cDKO) mice. To determine whether the reduced expression of the CREB target genes in these mutant mice is due to loss of presenilin directly or secondary to the impaired neuronal activity, we established a sensitive luciferase reporter system to assess direct transcriptional regulation in cultured cells. We first used immortalized PS-deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), and found that both CREB-mediated transcription and Notch-mediated HES1 transcription are decreased. However, the ubiquitin-C promoter-mediated transcription is also reduced, and among these three reporters, transfection of exogenous PS1 can rescue only the Notch-mediated HES1 transcription. Further Northern analysis revealed transcriptional alterations of Creb, ubiquitin-C, and other housekeeping genes in PS-deficient MEFs, indicating transcriptional dysregulation in these cells. We then used the Cre/loxP system to develop a postnatal PS-deficient cortical neuronal culture. Surprisingly, in these PS-null neurons, CREB-mediated transcription is not significantly decreased, and levels of total and phosphorylated CREB proteins are unchanged as well. Notch-mediated HES1 transcription is markedly reduced, and this reduction can be rescued by exogenous PS1. Together, our findings suggest that CREB-mediated transcription is regulated indirectly by PS in the adult cerebral cortex, and that attenuation of CREB target gene expression in PS cDKO mice is likely due to reduced neuronal activity in these mutant brains."

This memory decays rapidly and after a second only 3 or 4 items can be stored in working memory. Here we compared the dynamics of objective performance with a measure of subjective report and we observed that 1) Objective performance beyond explicit subjective reports (blindsight) was significantly more pronounced within a short temporal interval and within specific locations of the visual field which were robust across sessions 2) High confidence errors (false beliefs) were largely confined to a small spatial window neighboring the cue. The size of this window did not change in time 3) Subjective confidence showed a moderate but consistent decrease with time, independent of all other experimental factors. Our study allowed us to asses quantitatively the temporal and spatial access to an objective response and to subjective reports."
https://openalex.org/W2054500458,"Many risk factors have been identified for chronic low back pain (cLBP), but only one study evaluated their interrelations. We aimed to investigate the frequency of cLBP risk factors and their interrelations in patients consulting their general practitioners (GPs) for cLBP.A cross-sectional, descriptive, national survey was performed. 3000 GPs randomly selected were asked to include at least one patient consulting for cLBP. Demographic, clinical characteristics and the presence of cLBP risk factors were recorded. The frequency of each cLBP risk factor was calculated and multiple correspondence analysis (MCA) was performed to study their interrelations.A total of 2068 GPs (68.9%) included at least 1 patient, for 4522 questionnaires analyzed. In the whole sample of patients, the 2 risk factors most commonly observed were history of recurrent LBP (72.1%) and initial limitation of activities of daily living (66.4%). For working patients, common professional risk factors were beliefs, that LBP was due to maintaining a specific posture at work (79.0%) and frequent heavy lifting at work (65.5%). On MCA, we identified 3 risk-factor dimensions (axes) for working and nonworking patients. The main dimension for working patients involved professional risk factors and among these factors, patients' job satisfaction and job recognition largely contribute to this dimension.Our results shed in light for the first time the interrelation and the respective contribution of several previously identified cLBP risk factors. They suggest that risk factors representing a ""work-related"" dimension are the most important cLBP risk factors in the working population."
https://openalex.org/W2144790481,"Gorlin's or nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome (NBCCS) causes predisposition to basal cell carcinoma (BCC), the commonest cancer in adult human. Mutations in the tumor suppressor gene PTCH1 are responsible for this autosomal dominant syndrome. In NBCCS patients, as in the general population, ultraviolet exposure is a major risk factor for BCC development. However these patients also develop BCCs in sun-protected areas of the skin, suggesting the existence of other mechanisms for BCC predisposition in NBCCS patients. As increasing evidence supports the idea that the stroma influences carcinoma development, we hypothesized that NBCCS fibroblasts could facilitate BCC occurence of the patients. WT (n = 3) and NBCCS fibroblasts bearing either nonsense (n = 3) or missense (n = 3) PTCH1 mutations were cultured in dermal equivalents made of a collagen matrix and their transcriptomes were compared by whole genome microarray analyses. Strikingly, NBCCS fibroblasts over-expressed mRNAs encoding pro-tumoral factors such as Matrix Metalloproteinases 1 and 3 and tenascin C. They also over-expressed mRNA of pro-proliferative diffusible factors such as fibroblast growth factor 7 and the stromal cell-derived factor 1 alpha, known for its expression in carcinoma associated fibroblasts. These data indicate that the PTCH1(+/-) genotype of healthy NBCCS fibroblasts results in phenotypic traits highly reminiscent of those of BCC associated fibroblasts, a clue to the yet mysterious proneness to non photo-exposed BCCs in NBCCS patients."
https://openalex.org/W1973661404,"Progenitor cells in the adult dentate gyrus provide a constant supply of neuronal precursors, yet only a small fraction of these cells survive and develop into mature dentate granule cells (DGCs). A major challenge of current research is thus to understand the stringent selection process that governs the maturation and functional integration of adult-born DGCs. In mature DGCs, high-frequency stimulation (HFS) of the perforant path input elicits robust expression of the immediate early gene Arc/Arg3.1, trafficking of its mRNA to dendrites, and local synthesis of the protein necessary for consolidation of long-term potentiation (LTP). Given the synaptic commitment inherent in LTP consolidation, we considered that HFS-evoked expression of Arc could be used to timemap the functional integration of newborn DGCs. Dividing cells were birthmarked by BrdU-labeling at 1, 7, 14, 21, or 28 days prior to induction of LTP and expression of Arc was examined by confocal microscopy. Contrary to expectation, LTP did not induce Arc expression in newborn cells at any age, suggesting they might be refractory to synaptically-evoked Arc expression for at least one month. Importantly, however, spontaneous expression of Arc was detected in BrdU-labeled cells and strongly associated with the survival and maturation of NeuN-positive DGCs. Moreover, Arc expression at the earliest ages (1 and 7 days), clearly precedes the formation of glutamatergic synapses on new neurons. These results suggest an unexpected early role for Arc in adult-born DGCs, distinct from its functions in LTP, LTD, and homeostatic synaptic plasticity."

Since several important effects of nitric oxide are mediated by cGMP-dependent pathways, we investigated the role of the cGMP downstream effector cGMP-dependent protein kinase I (cGKI) on postnatal neovascularization.In a disc neovascularization model, cGKI(-/-) mice showed an impaired neovascularization as compared to their wild-type (WT) littermates. Infusion of WT, but not cGKI(-/-) bone marrow progenitors rescued the impaired ingrowth of new vessels in cGKI-deficient mice. Bone marrow progenitors from cGKI(-/-) mice showed reduced proliferation and survival rates. In addition, we used cGKIalpha leucine zipper mutant (LZM) mice as model for cGKI deficiency. LZM mice harbor a mutation in the cGKIalpha leucine zipper that prevents interaction with downstream signaling molecules. Consistently, LZM mice exhibited reduced numbers of vasculogenic progenitors and impaired neovascularization following hindlimb ischemia compared to WT mice.Our findings demonstrate that the cGMP-cGKI pathway is critical for postnatal neovascularization and establish a new role for cGKI in vasculogenesis, which is mediated by bone marrow-derived progenitors."
https://openalex.org/W2042983671,"The role of Tau phosphorylation in neurofibrillary degeneration linked to Alzheimer's disease remains to be established. While transgenic mice based on FTDP-17 Tau mutations recapitulate hallmarks of neurofibrillary degeneration, cell models could be helpful for exploratory studies on molecular mechanisms underlying Tau pathology. Here, ""human neuronal cell lines"" overexpressing Wild Type or mutated Tau were established. Two-dimensional electrophoresis highlights that mutated Tau displayed a specific phosphorylation pattern, which occurs in parallel to the formation of Tau clusters as visualized by electron microscopy. In fact, this pattern is also displayed before Tau pathology onset in a well established mouse model relevant to Tau aggregation in Alzheimer's disease. This study suggests first that pathological Tau mutations may change the distribution of phosphate groups. Secondly, it is possible that this molecular event could be one of the first Tau modifications in the neurofibrillary degenerative process, as this phenomenon appears prior to Tau pathology in an in vivo model and is linked to early steps of Tau nucleation in Tau mutants cell lines. Such cell lines consist in suitable and evolving models to investigate additional factors involved in molecular pathways leading to whole Tau aggregation."

Recently the L611S point mutation in JAK2 has been identified in a child with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Here we analyzed the mechanism by which JAK2 exhibits its oncogenicity. In BaF3 murine hematopoietic cells, L611S mutant increased the expression of antiapoptotic proteins including X chromosome-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein, inhibitor of apoptosis protein, and Bcl-XL. We also showed that JAK2 L611S mutant protects BaF3 cells from cytokine withdrawal-induced apoptotic cell death and leads to cytokine-independent cell growth. Furthermore BaF3 cells expressing JAK2 L611S mutant gained the ability to induce tumorigenesis in nude mice. The L611S mutant also exhibited malignancy, including prompt invasion and spreading into various organs, leading to rapid lethality of the mice. Finally we showed that a specific JAK2 inhibitor, AG490, potently inhibited cytokine-independent cell growth induced by JAK2 L611S mutant via the induction of apoptotic cell death. In addition, treatment with AG490 significantly inhibited the JAK2 L611S mutant-induced tumorigenesis in nude mice.

Recent studies showed that JAK2 activates the mitogen-activated protein kinase family (ERK, c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK), and p38), Akt, and the signal transducers and activators of transcription (Stat) family in various tissues and is involved in numerous biological functions such as cell growth, cell survival, and differentiation (1Baker S.J.

Therefore, it has been reported that the disruption of the regulation of JAK2 activity is associated with hematopoietic disorders and oncogenesis (3O'Sullivan L.A. Liongue C. Lewis R.S.

JAK2 contains seven regions with significant sequence homology between the kinases, termed Jak homology (JH) domains (1Baker S.J. Rane S.G. Reddy E.P.

The JH1 domain is located within the carboxyl terminus of the protein and contains the tyrosine kinase domain. The adjacent JH2 domain shows close homology to the JH1 domain; however, it lacks critical residues required for tyrosine kinase activity. Under normal conditions, this JH2 domain negatively regulates kinase activity. Theoretical models of JAK2 structure suggest that the JH1 and JH2 domains are facing each other and that the activation loop of JAK2 is buried at this interface (6Lindauer K. Loerting T. Liedl K.R. Kroemer R.T. Protein Eng. 2001; 14: 27-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Upon activation of JAK2, phosphorylation of the activation loop at Tyr1007/1008 occurs and is believed to prevent this JH1-JH2 interaction and therefore relieve inhibition (7Feng J.

These facts clearly suggest that JH2 domain may harbor the ability to negatively regulate JAK2 activity. The single point mutation leading to a V617F substitution in the JH2 domain of JAK2 has been identified in the majority of patients with myeloproliferative disorders such as polycythemia vera, essential thrombocytosis, and primary myelofibrosis. It has also been demonstrated that this mutation in JAK2 leads to deregulated kinase activity and constitutive activation of the signaling pathway (10James C. Ugo V. Le Couédic J.P. Staerk J.

Stanulla M. Leukemia. 2006; 20: 381-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) reported a novel JAK2 point mutation (L611S) in a patient with acute lymphoblastic leukemia that is quite close to the V617F mutation observed in various myeloproliferative diseases. It is easy to imagine that the mutation of several amino acid residues in JH2 domain would disrupt the regulation of JAK2 activity. Indeed we previously reported that the limited region in JH2 domain is critical for the regulation of JAK2 using systematically mutated JAK2 constructs. In the course of screening, we found that several point mutation in JH2 domain of JAK2, including Y613E, V617F, and L611S, exhibited the ability to induce erythroid colony formation even in the absence of erythropoietin (Epo) in JAK2-deficient fetal liver (14Funakoshi-Tago M. Pelletier S. Moritake H. Parganas E. Ihle J.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2008; 28: 1792-1801Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Thus, it is expected that an acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) patient-derived L611S mutation would induce the constitutive activation of JAK2. Here, to define the signaling mechanisms activated by JAK2 L611S mutant, we investigated the characterization of this mutant both in vitro and in vivo. Interestingly we show that JAK2 L611S mutant could act as an oncogene to transform BaF3 cells and to promote tumor formation in nude mice. Furthermore our results also suggested that treatment with the JAK2 inhibitor AG490 could be a clue for the targeted therapy against JAK2 L611S mutant-related disorders. Reagents—Recombinant human Epo (ESPO®3000) was purchased from Kirin Brewery Co. (Tokyo, Japan). AG490 was purchased from Tocris Bioscience (Ellisville, MO). For administration to nude mice, AG490 was diluted in DMSO at a concentration of 25 mg/ml. The stock solution was further diluted to 2.5 mg/ml in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Anti-phospho-JAK2 (Tyr1007/1008) antibody, anti-phospho-Stat5 antibody (Tyr694), anti-phospho-ERK antibody (Thr202/Tyr204), anti-phospho-Akt antibody (Ser473), anti-Stat5 antibody, anti-ERK antibody, anti-Akt antibody, and anti-XIAP antibody were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (Danvers, MA).

(Minneapolis, MN). Peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse and goat anti-rabbit secondary antibodies were from Dako (Glostrup, Denmark). Cell Cultures—BaF3 cells were infected with empty virus (MSCV), wild type JAK2 (WT) c-HA, or mutant JAK2 c-HA (L611S) with erythropoietin receptor c-FLAG and established as described previously (14Funakoshi-Tago M. Pelletier S. Moritake H. Parganas E. Ihle J.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2008; 28: 1792-1801Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). These cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium (Nissui Seiyaku, Tokyo, Japan) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (BioWest), 100 μg/ml l-glutamine (Nacalai Tesque, Tokyo, Japan), 100 μg/ml penicillin (Nacalai Tesque), 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Nacalai Tesque), and 5 units/ml Epo. BaF3 Cell Growth Assay—Transduced and exponentially growing BaF3 cells were washed twice with PBS and incubated with RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 1% fetal bovine serum and 100 mg/ml l-glutamine in the presence or absence of Epo (5 units/ml) for the indicated times. Living cells were counted using a Beckman Coulter Vi-CELL (Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, CA). Cell viability was checked by trypan blue exclusion method. BrdUrd Cell Proliferation Assay—Transduced and exponentially growing BaF3 cells were washed twice with PBS and incubated with RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 1% fetal bovine serum and 100 mg/ml l-glutamine in the presence or absence of Epo (5 units/ml) for 24 h. The proliferation rate was determined using the BrdUrd labeling and detection enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit III (Roche Applied Science). Cell Cycle Analysis—After treatment, cells were washed with PBS and fixed with 70% (v/v) ethanol at –20 °C overnight. Cells were then centrifuged at 5,000 rpm for 2 min and resuspended in PBS containing 10 μg/ml RNase A (Wako, Tokyo, Japan) and 100 μg/ml propidium iodide (Sigma-Aldrich). Following 30-min incubation, cell cycle parameters were determined by flow cytometry analysis using FACSCalibur as described previously (15Funakoshi-Tago M. Tago K. Nishizawa C. Takahashi K. Mashino T. Iwata S. Inoue H. Sonoda Y. Kasahara T. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2008; 76: 1681-1693Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). All data were recorded and analyzed using CellQuest software. DNA Fragmentation Assay—Genomic DNA was prepared for gel electrophoresis as described previously (15Funakoshi-Tago M. Tago K. Nishizawa C. Takahashi K. Mashino T. Iwata S. Inoue H. Sonoda Y. Kasahara T. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2008; 76: 1681-1693Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Electrophoresis was performed on a 1% (w/v) agarose gel in Tris-boric acid buffer. Fragmented DNA was visualized by staining with ethidium bromide after electrophoresis. Immunoprecipitation and Western Blotting—Cells were harvested in ice-cold PBS and lysed in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10% glycerol, 50 mm NaCl, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1% Nonidet P-40, 20 mm NaF, 0.2 mm Na3VO4) supplemented with protease inhibitors. Cell lysates were centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 15 min to remove debris, and the supernatants were incubated with the indicated antibody for 4 h. Immune complexes were precipitated with protein G-Sepharose (Zymed Laboratories Inc.), washed three times with lysis buffer, and then eluted with Laemmli sample buffer for SDS-PAGE. Eluted proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore, Billerica, MA). Membranes were probed using the designated antibodies and visualized with the ECL detection system (GE Healthcare). RNA Isolation and Reverse Transcription-PCR—RNA was prepared using an RNA purification kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Reverse transcription was performed using an oligo(dT)20 primer and 2 μg of total RNA for first strand cDNA synthesis as described previously (16Funakoshi-Tago M. Sonoda Y. Tanaka S. Hashimoto K.

PCR was performed at an annealing temperature of 57 °C with 22 amplification cycles for XIAP, cIAP, and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. For Bcl-XL, PCR was performed at an annealing temperature of 60 °C with 25 amplification cycles. PCR products were resolved and electrophoresed in a 1.5% agarose gel in TAE (Tris-acetic acid-EDTA) buffer. The PCR primer sequences were as follows: glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, 5′-ACTCCACTCACGGCAAATTC-3′ (upstream) and 5′-CCTTCCACAATGCCAAAGTT-3′ (downstream); XIAP, 5′-GGCCGGACTATGCTCATTTA-3′ (upstream) and 5′-TGCCCCTTCTCATCCAATAG-3′ (downstream); cIAP, 5′-TGCTGTGGCCTGATGTTGGATA-3′ (upstream) and 5′-GAAAATGTCTGCGGTGCTCTGA-3′ (downstream); Bcl-XL, 5′-TGGTGGTCGACTTTCTCTCC-3′ (upstream) and 5′-CTCCATCCCGAAAGAGTTCA-3′ (downstream). Animal Tumorigenesis and Administration of AG490—To test the oncogenic potentials of JAK2 L611S mutant in vivo, 1 × 107 transduced BaF3 cells (MSCV, WT, or L611S BaF3 cells) were injected subcutaneously into BALB/c nude mice aged 4 weeks. After injection of BaF3 cells, the mice were treated daily for 10 days with intraperitoneal injection of AG490 (500 μg/day). Two weeks postinoculation, the animals were sacrificed, and the weights of tumor, liver, spleen, and lymph node were recorded. For intravenous inoculation, 5 × 104 transduced BaF3 cells (MSCV, WT, or L611S BaF3 cells) were injected into BALB/c nude mice aged 7 weeks. Histological Examination—After sacrifice, liver and spleen of each nude mouse were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and then dehydrated gradually in alcohol. The tissues were embedded in paraffin and were sectioned at a thickness of 2 μm. Lymph node was embedded in Tissue-Tek OCT compound (Sakura Finetek, Torrance, CA) and frozen in liquid nitrogen. Cryostat sections were cut at 6 μm, air dried, and stored at –20 °C until use. The sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin and analyzed for the presence of tumor cell infiltration using an Olympus BX50 microscope (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) with Olympus Micro DP70 software. Plasmid, Retrovirus Production, and Infection—MSCV-IRES-GFP-Stat5A (1*6) was a gift from Dr. James N. Ihle (St. Jude Children's Research Hospital). A constitutively active form of murine Stat5A cDNA (1*6) harbors substitutions at amino acid residue 711 from serine to phenylalanine (S711F) and at 299 from histidine to arginine (H299R) as reported previously (17Onishi M.

HEK293T cells were transfected with helper retrovirus plasmid together with retroviral plasmids by FuGENE 6 transfection reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions (Roche Diagnostics). Viruses were harvested 24–60 h posttransfection, pooled, and stored on ice. BaF3 cells were infected using the precoated plates by RetroNectine (Takara) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Leukemia-derived JAK2 L611S Mutant Induced Constitutive Activation of ERK, Akt, and Stat5—Recently a point mutation of JAK2 (L611S), illustrated in Fig. 1A, has been found in a child with ALL (13Kratz C.P. Böll S. Kontny U. Schrappe M. Niemeyer C.M. Stanulla M. Leukemia. 2006; 20: 381-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). L611S mutation is located in JH2 domain of JAK2. To investigate the function of this L611S mutation, we generated the BaF3 cells by retroviral infection with the control virus (BaF3/MSCV), viruses including the wild type JAK2 c-HA (BaF3/WT) or the JAK2 mutant c-HA harboring L611S mutation (BaF3/L611S), and retrovirus including the cDNA of Epo receptor c-FLAG (Fig. 1A). First to test whether L611S mutation could affect JAK2 activity, the phosphorylation at Tyr1007/1008 in the activation loop was determined. Although wild type JAK2 was phosphorylated at Tyr1007/1008 in response to Epo, the phosphorylation of JAK2 L611S mutant was constitutively observed (Fig. 1B). In addition, JAK2 L611S mutant induced the constitutive phosphorylation of ERK, Akt, and Stat5 regardless of Epo stimulation, although the phosphorylation of these molecules was induced by Epo in BaF3/MSCV cells and BaF3/WT cells (Fig. 1C). Interestingly the expression of JAK2 L611S mutant conferred growth factor independence to BaF3 cells (Fig. 1D, left). On the other hand, in the presence of Epo, no difference in cell growth of each type of cells was observed (Fig. 1D, right). Furthermore the proliferation rates of these cells were analyzed by BrdUrd incorporation as shown in Fig. 1E. In the presence of Epo, active proliferation of these three cell lines was detected. In contrast, in the absence of Epo, only the BaF3 cells expressing JAK2 L611S mutant showed significant proliferation ability. JAK2 L611S Mutant Inhibited Cytokine Withdraw-induced Apoptotic Cell Death—Cytokine deprivation has been classically used to study molecular processes of apoptosis. Following Epo withdraw, both BaF3/MSCV cells and BaF3/WT cells underwent death. On the other hand, only BaF3/L611S cells could survive for 3 days after Epo deprivation. In the presence of Epo, cell death was not detected in these three cell lines (Fig. 2A). We next determined the different phases of cell cycle distribution in these cells following 24 h of Epo deprivation. There was a significant increase of sub-G1 phase, which is consistent with apoptotic cells, in both BaF3/MSCV cells and BaF3/WT cells (Fig. 2B). Epo deprivation also induced the activation of casepase-3 and caspase-9 in both BaF3/MSCV cells and BaF3/WT cells (Fig. 2C). Furthermore a ladder pattern of DNA internucleosomal fragmentation was clearly seen in both BaF3/MSCV cells and BaF3/WT cells following 24 h of Epo deprivation, confirming that these cells underwent apoptotic cell death (Fig. 2D). On the other hand, there were no drastic changes of cell cycle distribution, caspase activity, and DNA fragmentation in BaF3/L611S cells regardless of Epo stimulation (Fig. 2, B, C, and D). We also analyzed the property of JAK2 L611S mutant using another murine myeloid cell line, DA3, which requires the presence of growth factor for its proliferation. As shown in supplemental Fig. 1S, DA3 cells expressing JAK2 L611S mutant survived after cytokine removal and exhibited antiapoptotic effects. XIAP and cIAP1 are prominent members of the inhibitor of apoptosis protein family that exert antiapoptotic effects by interfering with the processing and activities of the executioner caspase-3 (18Deveraux Q.L. Takahashi R. Salvesen G.S. Reed J.C. Nature. 1997; 388: 300-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (1712) Google Scholar, 19Roy N. Deveraux Q.L. Takahashi R. Salvesen G.S. Reed J.C. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6914-6925Crossref PubMed Scopus (1131) Google Scholar). Bcl-XL is also known to be an important modulator of antiapoptosis (20Boise L.H. González-García M. Postema C.E. Ding L. Lindsten T. Turka L.A. Mao X. Nuñez G. Thompson C.B. Cell. 1993; 74: 597-608Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2917) Google Scholar, 21Gottschalk A.R. Boise L.H. Thompson C.B. Quintáns J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7350-7354Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). Thus, we investigated the effect of JAK2 L611S mutant on the expression of the antiapoptotic proteins. Interestingly Epo deprivation reduced mRNA expression of XIAP, cIAP, and Bcl-XL in both BaF3/MSCV cells and BaF3/WT cells. On the other hand, the mRNA expression level of these antiapoptotic genes was not changed in BaF3/L611S cells regardless of Epo stimulation (Fig. 2E). Consistently although Epo withdraw induced a drastic decline in the protein levels of XIAP, cIAP, and Bcl-XL in both BaF3/MSCV cells and BaF3/WT cells, constant expression of these proteins was observed in BaF3/L611S cells even in the absence of Epo stimulation (Fig. 2F). These data demonstrate that JAK2 L611S mutant strongly inhibits the cytokine deprivation-induced apoptosis. JAK2 L611S Mutant Could Promote Tumorigenesis in Nude Mice—Next to address the function of JAK2 L611S mutant in vivo, we examined whether subcutaneous inoculation of transduced BaF3 cells into nude mice could induce tumor formation. Interestingly at 10 days after inoculation, significant tumor formation was observed in the nude mice receiving BaF3/L611S cells but not BaF3/MSCV cells and BaF3/WT cells (data not shown). The tumors first appeared at the injection sites after 5 days of inoculation and then dramatically grew to an average of 0.69 ± 0.15 g at 14 days (data not shown). As compared with BaF3/MSCV and BaF3/WT, the life spans of nude mice receiving BaF3/L611S cells were severely reduced, and all mice died by 22 days after inoculation (Fig. 3A). In the nude mice receiving BaF3/L611S cells, the sizes of liver, spleen, and lymph node were abnormally enlarged compared with those in the mice receiving BaF3/MSCV and BaF3/WT (Fig. 3B). Namely the weights of liver, spleen, and lymph node of BaF3/L611S cell-injected mice were significantly increased (Fig. 3C). The average weight of liver in BaF3/L611S cell-inoculated mice increased about 1.5-fold (1.74 ± 0.13 versus 1.17 ± 0.05 g for BaF3/MSCV and 1.21 ± 0.17 g for BaF3/WT), whereas the average weight of spleen in BaF3/L611S mice increased even more severely to about 9-fold (0.72 ± 0.09 versus 0.08 ± 0.02 g for BaF3/MSCV and 0.07 ± 0.01 g for BaF3/WT). Similarly the average weight of lymph node in BaF3/L611S cell-inoculated mice also increased about 7-fold (120 ± 1.6 versus 17.3 ± 0.3 mg for BaF3/MSCV and 14.3 ± 0.5 mg for BaF3/WT) (Fig. 3C). Furthermore we also examined intravenous injection of transduced BaF3 cells because intravenous inoculation is a more suitable model for leukemia. As shown in Fig. 3D, after intravenous injection of BaF3/L611S cells, nude mice died within 9 days. The intravenous injection of BaF3/L611S cells induced enlargement of liver and spleen as well as subcutaneous injection (Fig. 3E). The average weight of liver in BaF3/L611S cell-inoculated mice increased about 1.8-fold (2.56 ± 0.13 versus 1.40 ± 0.13 g for BaF3/MSCV and 1.37 ± 0.07g for BaF3/WT), whereas the average weight of spleen in BaF3/L611S mice increased about 7-fold (1.02 ± 0.08 versus 0.14 ± 0.03 g for BaF3/MSCV and 0.12 ± 0.02 g for BaF3/WT) (Fig. 3F). Therefore, the overexpression of JAK2 L611S mutant at the intracellular compartment could promote tumor formation in vivo. JAK2 L611S Mutant Promoted Tumor Cell Invasion—In this study, we used a retrovirus expression vector, MSCV-IRES-GFP, and sorted the infected cells based on green fluorescent protein (GFP) expression as described previously (14Funakoshi-Tago M. Pelletier S. Moritake H. Parganas E. Ihle J.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2008; 28: 1792-1801Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). To examine the possible invasion effect of BaF3/L611S cells, the hepatocytes and splenocytes were prepared from the subcutaneously BaF3 cell-injected nude mice, and GFP expression levels in these cells were monitored by flow cytometry analysis. Interestingly GFP-positive cells were observed in hepatocytes and splenocytes prepared from BaF3/L611S cell-inoculated mice (Fig. 4A). Furthermore various organ sections including liver, spleen, and lymph node were prepared and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. In the subcutaneous injection site, the BaF3/L611S cells behaved like a malignant tumor and could actively grow and penetrate into various organs. In liver, the infiltration of tumor cells disrupted the arrangement of hepatocytes in the lobules (Fig. 4B, upper). Also these BaF3/L611S cells frequently promoted the dissemination of transformed cells into spleen (Fig. 4B, bottom). Furthermore lymph node sections showed that the invasion of tumor cells was widely spread in nude mice inoculated with BaF3/L611S cells (data not shown). In contrast, there were no invasion by tumor cells and tissue distributions observed when BaF3/MSCV cells and BaF3/WT cells were inoculated. Thus, these results indicate that the oncogenic properties of JAK2 L611S mutant are not only associated with cellular transformation and tumorigenesis but also have a strong invasion activity into various organs, which leads to rapid animal death. AG490 Induces Apoptotic Cell Death of BaF3 Cells Expressing JAK2 L611S Mutant—Because AG490 is a specific inhibitor for JAK2 (22Meydan N. Grunberger T. Dadi H. Shahar M.A. Arpaia E. Lapidot Z. Leeder J.S. Freedman M. Cohen A. Gazit A. Levitzki A. Roifman C.M. Nature. 1996; 379: 645-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (847) Google Scholar), we initially examined whether AG490 could inhibit the activation of JAK2 L611S mutant. The treatment with AG490 at 30 μm was found to inhibit not only Epo-induced phosphorylation of wild type JAK2 but also the constitutive phosphorylation of JAK2 L611S mutant (Fig. 5A). Furthermore constitutive activation of ERK, Akt, and Stat5 observed in BaF3/L611S cells was significantly inhibited by treatment with AG490 (Fig. 5B). To demonstrate the specific effect of AG490 as a JAK2 inhibitor, BaF3/MSCV cells, BaF3/WT cells, and BaF3/L611S cells were further infected with virus harboring a constitutively active mutant of Stat5A (1*6) or GFP as a control (Fig. 5C). As shown in Fig. 5D, treatment with AG490 inhibited Epo-induced survival of both BaF3/MSCV cells and BaF3/WT cells. The survival of BaF3/L611S cells was also inhibited by treatment with AG490 in the presence and absence of Epo stimulation. Moreover the expression of Stat5A (1*6) rescued AG490-induced cell death of MSCV/BaF3 cells, WT/BaF3 cells, and L611S/BaF3 cells regardless of Epo stimulation (Fig. 5D), suggesting that AG490 specifically inhibited JAK2 activation. Then to determine whether the antiapoptotic effect of JAK2 L611S mutant is derived from its constitutive catalytic activity, we examined the effect of AG490 on the antiapoptot"

Complete definition of the three-dimensional structure of Pol II is essential for understanding the mechanisms that regulate transcription via protein-protein interactions within the Pol II apparatus. To date a series of Pol II-related crystal structures have been reported. However, certain peptide regions, including several that are implicated to interact with regulatory factors, remain obscure. Here we describe conformations for two such regions that are close to the Pol II surface and assume seemingly flexible loop structures. One is located in the TFIIF-interacting Protrusion domain, whereas the other is in the TFIIE-interacting Clamp domain. This structural definition was aided by the application of an advanced crystallographic refinement approach that utilizes the single anomalous diffraction (SAD) from zinc ions bound intrinsically in Pol II. The SAD-based strategy allowed the 12-subunit Pol II model to be fully refined up to 3.8 Å with excellent stereochemical properties, demonstrating the effectiveness of the SAD approach for the refinement of large structures at low-to-moderate resolutions. Our results also define additional components of the free Pol II, including the functionally critical Fork Loop-1 and Fork Loop-2 elements. As such, this refined Pol II model provides the most complete structural reference for future analyses of complex structures formed between Pol II and its regulatory factors.

Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 327-335Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar). Pol II is a dodecameric protein assembled from a tightly associated 10-subunit core and a heterodimeric subcomplex of subunits Rpb4 and Rpb7 (2Edwards A.M. Kane C.M. Young R.A. Kornberg R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 71-75Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although the 10-subunit core harbors the central transesterase activity that catalyzes RNA-chain polymerization, the Rpb4/7 heterodimer enables promoter-dependent initiation by the polymerase and supports yeast growth under stress conditions (3Woychik N.A. Young R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 2854-2859Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 4Rosenheck S. Choder M. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 6187-6192Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). An x-ray crystallographic breakthrough (5Fu J. Gnatt A.L. Bushnell D.A. Jensen G.J. Thompson N.E. Burgess R.R. David P.R. Kornberg R.D. Cell. 1999; 98: 799-810Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) combined with biochemical characterizations of the Pol II system using materials from Baker's yeast has led to a high resolution structure of the 10-subunit core (6Cramer P. Bushnell D.A. Kornberg R.D. Science. 2001; 292: 1863-1876Crossref PubMed Scopus (961) Google Scholar) and the complete 12-subunit structure at moderate resolutions (7Bushnell D.A. Kornberg R.D. Proc.

These structural results have shed new light on the molecular mechanism that underlies the enzymatic process of pre-mRNA synthesis (9Westover K.D. Bushnell D.A. Kornberg R.D.

Hampsey M. Cell. 2002; 108: 453-463Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 13Trinh V. Langelier M.F. Archambault J. Coulombe B. Microbiol. Mol. Biol.

The success of this line of structural work along with the techniques and precautions developed during the process (5Fu J. Gnatt A.L. Bushnell D.A. Jensen G.J. Thompson N.E. Burgess R.R. David P.R. Kornberg R.D. Cell. 1999; 98: 799-810Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 15Meyer P.A. Ye P. Zhang M. Suh M.H. Fu J. Structure. 2006; 14: 973-982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) has opened the door to elucidating the structures of Pol II-factor complexes and understanding the regulatory mechanisms that govern class II transcription activities in the nucleus. Structural refinement is an important step in establishing crystallographic models for macromolecules, and its feasibility is traditionally determined by the resolution limit of diffraction datasets collected from macromolecular crystals in question. More explicitly, refinement feasibility depends on whether there are a sufficient number of observations per atomic parameter to be refined. In general, refinement for macromolecules is greatly helped by the fact that amino or nucleic acid residues in the biopolymers obey their standard stereochemistry, thus imposing additional restraints on the atomic coordinate space (16Hendrickson W.A. Methods Enzymol. 1985; 115: 252-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar). As a rule-of-thumb, data to 3 Å are minimally required for the full refinement of a coordinate set, and higher resolutions give greater ratios of observations/parameters and, hence, finer refinement results. Based on this crystallographic guidelines, the 10-subunit Pol II core whose crystals diffracted to as high as 2.3 Å has been fully refined with sound atomic geometrical properties (10Westover K.D. Bushnell D.A. Kornberg R.D. Cell. 2004; 119: 481-489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). However, refinement of the 12-subunit Pol II has been hampered by the fact that the related crystals diffracted to no better than 3.4 Å (7Bushnell D.A. Kornberg R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 6969-6973Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar, 8Armache K.J. Kettenberger H. Cramer P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 6964-6968Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 11Brueckner F. Cramer P. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2008; 15: 811-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 15Meyer P.A. Ye P.

Cell. 2004; 16: 955-965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). A compromise strategy was used for the refinement at 3.8 Å where a separately refined Rpb4/7 heterodimer was combined with a refined 10-subunit core to produce the 12-subunit Pol II, and a few rounds of further iteration were performed (18Armache K.J. Mitterweger S. Meinhart A. Cramer P. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 7131-7134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Here, we describe a full refinement of the 12-subunit Pol II structure at 3.8 Å using a newly developed algorithm that is capable of parameter refinement for crystals that diffract to moderate resolutions (e.g. 3–4 Å). This technique utilizes the diffraction signals from anomalous scatters in the crystal and incorporates this additional information into a multivariate likelihood target function (19Skubak P. Murshudov G.N. Pannu N.S. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2196-2201Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 20Skubak P. Ness S. Pannu N.S. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2005; 61: 1626-1635Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar) to increase the number of observations, thus improving the ratio of observations to parameters. When this technique was applied to make use of single anomalous diffraction (SAD) from the zinc ions bound intrinsically in Pol II, a Pol II structure was obtained with significant improvements as judged by comparison to available models of the 12-subunit Pol II with regard to stereochemical properties. Also as a result, we have been able to determine the structures of three segments of polypeptide chains that have not been seen in free Pol II models published to date. Two of these regions map to the surface locations that have been shown to interact with general transcription factors TFIIF and TFIIE (21Chen H.T. Warfield L. Hahn S. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2007; 14: 696-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the refined model provides supporting evidence for movement of the Fork Loop-2 element, which has been implicated in DNA unwinding (11Brueckner F. Cramer P. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2008; 15: 811-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 22Wang D. Bushnell D.A. Westover K.D. Kaplan C.D. Kornberg R.D. Cell. 2006; 127: 941-954Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar), and helps visualize the range of conformational fluctuation of Fork Loop-1 during its engagement with the template and transcript. Our results demonstrate the utility of the SAD-based crystallographic refinement technique in structural determination of large multiprotein complexes whose crystals often diffract to limited resolutions (e.g. lower than 3.5 Å) and reveal elusive information such as the conformation of those Pol II elements involved in interactions with transcription initiation factors. Our fully refined Pol II provides the most up-to-date and effective model for difference Fourier analyses of novel Pol II-factor(s) complexes in the future. Purification of Pol II from yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) and its crystallization, x-ray diffraction data collection, and experimental phasing have been described previously (15Meyer P.A. Ye P. Zhang M. Suh M.H. Fu J. Structure. 2006; 14: 973-982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). X-ray datasets from the best diffracting crystal (A3X7 in the previous work) were re-indexed and integrated with HKL2000 (23Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38453) Google Scholar), resulting in preservation of both normal and SAD data to 3.8 Å. To begin the process for refining the polymerase model against the SAD data, the anomalous scatterers (the eight intrinsic sites of zinc) were first refined with the BP3 program (24Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 22-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) against the zinc SAD data. Next, the previous unrefined 12-subunit model (15Meyer P.A. Ye P. Zhang M. Suh M.H. Fu J. Structure. 2006; 14: 973-982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) was subjected to geometry regularization, and thermal parameters (B-factors) of the model were reset to a uniform value of 77 Å2 according to the value from Wilson statistics. Refinement then proceeded using standard cycles of iteration between reciprocal space optimization using REFMAC5D (19Skubak P. Murshudov G.N. Pannu N.S. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2196-2201Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) and manual rebuilding in real-space. The SAD phase information was included into the refinement target by invoking REFMAC5D with inputs of the anomalous-scatterer model (8 zinc sites), scattering factors (f′=-6.4306, f″= 3.8873), and column label for SAD amplitudes in the data file. During initial iterations, only the positional parameters of the polymerase were refined. Once this had converged, further iterations were carried out with TLS groups (described below) in addition the positional parameters. The positional parameters of the anomalous scatterers were refined in concert with the polymerase model during both stages, allowing for simultaneous updating of the SAD phase information. The constant used for the relative weighting of x-ray and geometrical terms in REFMAC was manually adjusted because the weighting determined automatically by the program produced severe stereochemical distortions, although with lower R-factor values. Weighting terms for real-space refinement in COOT (25Emsley P. Cowtan K. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2126-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (23040) Google Scholar) were adjusted similarly. In the final stages of refinement, problematic regions were identified using ADIT (work station version) (26Berman H.M. Westbrook J. Feng Z. Gilliland G. Bhat T.N. Weissig H. Shindyalov I.N. Bourne P.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 235-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (26989) Google Scholar), MOLPROBITY (27Lovell S.C. Davis I.W. Arendall III, W.B. de Bakker P.I. Word J.M. Prisant M.G. Richardson J.S. Richardson D.C. Proteins. 2003; 50: 437-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (3818) Google Scholar), and COOT (25Emsley P. Cowtan K. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2126-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (23040) Google Scholar). Refinement of individual B-factors would not be feasible at this resolution (28Ten Eyck L.F. Watenpaugh K.D. Rossmann M.G. Arnold E. International Tables for Crystallography (F). 1st Ed. Kluwer Academic Publishers Group, Dordrecht, Netherlands2001: 369-374Google Scholar), even with the increased number of observations from including the SAD information. Therefore, the approach was taken to describe thermal motions of groups within the Pol II molecule using the TLS method (29Schomaker V. Trueblood K.N. Acta Crystallogr. 1968; 24: 63-76Crossref Google Scholar, 30Howlin B. Moss D.S. Harris G.W. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1989; 45: 851-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) instead. Two approaches were tested to define initial TLS groups; the first was to use previously known rigid-body domains of Pol II (6Cramer P. Bushnell D.A. Kornberg R.D. Science. 2001; 292: 1863-1876Crossref PubMed Scopus (961) Google Scholar, 15Meyer P.A. Ye P. Zhang M. Suh M.H. Fu J. Structure. 2006; 14: 973-982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), and the second was to derive TLS groups for each subunit by conducting several cycles of atomic B-factor refinement without positional refinement and submitting output to the TLSMD (31Painter J.

Possibly due to the restriction of TLS groups to individual peptides, the second approach did not perform better than the first. Therefore, the TLS groups based on the known rigid-body domains were chosen for subsequent refinement. During the course of refinement, these groups were subdivided as needed to account for regions of the model that showed increased mobility not accounted for by the existing groups. For example, a modification to the TLS groups was made when (i) atoms with negative displacements were indicated in the log file and (ii) negative Fo-Fc density was observed following a region of the model that showed otherwise good density. B-factor sharpening, as described in DeLaBarre and Brunger (32DeLaBarre B. Brunger A.T. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol.

The root-mean-square deviations from standard amino acid stereochemistry in supplemental Table S1B were calculated using REFMAC5 (33Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol.

Omit maps were calculated using the program OMIT in the CCP4 suite (34CCP4Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19734) Google Scholar). Figures were generated using PyMol (DeLano Scientific). Refined Structure of Complete Pol II—We found that the 12-subunit Pol II structure could be fully refined at 3.8 Å resolution with the multivariate-likelihood strategy of Pannu and co-workers (19Skubak P. Murshudov G.N. Pannu N.S. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2196-2201Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 20Skubak P. Ness S. Pannu N.S. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2005; 61: 1626-1635Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). We describe the crystallographic performance in the supplemental information. As a result of applying this technique and using the intrinsic zinc SAD data as additional observations, the quality of 12-subunit Pol II structure is significantly improved in comparison with the models published previously. As a demonstration of such improvement, Fig. 1 shows three structural regions (A, B, and C) where our data reveal side-chain densities (left panels) which have not been seen in the previous results (1WCM, center panel, and 2VUM, right panels). Additional examples of such improvement are shown in supplemental Fig. S1. Throughout the refinement process we observed density in 2Fo-Fc omit maps for a good number of residues that were not visible in the previously published 12-subunit models and built the amino acid structures accordingly. These included structural regions named Rpb2 Protrusion, Rpb1 Clamp Top, Fork Loop-1 (Fig. 2, A–C, respectively) and Fork Loop-2 (supplemental Fig. S2A), following the nomenclature for the 10-subunit Pol II. The former three regions were covered by density in both the omit (Fig. 2, right panels) and experimentally phased zinc multiwavelength anomalous diffraction (Fig. 2, left panels) maps, whereas Fork Loop-2 and 12 other residues were defined only in the model-based omit map (supplemental Fig. S2; Table 1). Altogether, 56 residues have been built throughout the refinement/rebuilding process. We discuss the functional relevance of these newly modeled regions below.TABLE 1Newly revealed regions of yeast Pol II The total number of residues modeled was 56.SubunitResiduesFunctional commentsShown inDensity observed in experimental and 2Fo-Fc omit mapsRpb271, 437–446Protrusion, TFIIF interactionFig. 2ARpb1187–195Clamp top, TFIIE interactionFig. 2BRpb2467–477Fork Loop-1, DNA/RNA hybrid interactionsFig. 2CDensity observed only in 2Fo-Fc omit mapRpb2502–510Fork Loop-2, DNA unwindingFig. S2ARpb11115Fig. S2BRpb3269Fig. S2CRpb81, 64, 75Fig. S2DRpb4117Fig. S2ERpb2336Fig. S2FRpb11091Fig. S2GRpb2720–722, 714–716Fig. S2HRpb2669Fig. S2IRpb1224Fig. S2J Open table in a new tab Conformation of the TFIIF-Interacting Rpb2 Protrusion— The earlier structures of Pol II had lacked a model for 10 amino acid residues in the protrusion domain of subunit Rpb2 (residues 437–446). A polyalanine chain was placed for this loop in an unrefined 12-subunit structure (15Meyer P.A. Ye P. Zhang M. Suh M.H. Fu J. Structure. 2006; 14: 973-982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). We have now been able to build a starting model for this region based on the experimental zinc multiwavelength anomalous diffraction density (Fig. 2A, left) and adjust the model during the cycle of refinement with SAD information. The Protrusion adopts a loop-like conformation (Fig. 3A, yellow) consistent with its electron densities in both the experimental and omitted 2Fo-Fc maps (Fig. 2A). The Protrusion Loop might be considered as partially disordered under the solution condition of the 10-subunit crystal because it was not visible in high resolution maps of the 10-subunit Pol II (6Cramer P. Bushnell D.A. Kornberg R.D. Science. 2001; 292: 1863-1876Crossref PubMed Scopus (961) Google Scholar, 35Cramer P. Bushnell D.A. Fu J. Gnatt A.L. Maier-Davis B. Thompson N.E. Burgess R.R. Edwards A.M. David P.R. Kornberg R.D. Science. 2000; 288: 640-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar). The Protrusion Loop connects the gap from Glu-437 to Leu-446 at one end of the two-helix coil in Rpb2. The protrusion domain has recently been shown to interact with the general transcription factor TFIIF in the context of transcription pre-initiation complex (21Chen H.T. Warfield L. Hahn S. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2007; 14: 696-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). The newly modeled loop sits at the apex of the helical coil (Fig. 3, A and B, yellow) and is bracketed in space by two TFIIF-cross-linking sites, one marked by Tyr-57 and Thr-68 of Rpb2 and the other by Gln-469 of Rpb2, the blue sites near Protrusion (Fig. 3B). The shortest distances from residues in Protrusion Loop to Tyr-57, Thr-68, and Gln-469 are 28, 18, and 25 Å, respectively. We observed density for yet another un-modeled region in the protrusion domain, Leu-71 through Ile-90 (Fig. 3C, red cages). The density shows that this region runs side-by-side with the protrusion loop. The strength of this density in our current map was not sufficient to allow model building, suggesting that this region is more mobile than Protrusion Loop. Based on the peptide chain directions before and after the break, we would expect this region to be hairpin-like if the structure should be stabilized. This region includes Leu-74 that is cross-linked to TFIIF in the pre-initiation complex (21Chen H.T. Warfield L. Hahn S. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2007; 14: 696-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Although Leu-74 has not been modeled, it is likely located within the bounds of the density. Because the Protrusion Loop is situated close to both Leu-74 and the above-mentioned TFIIF-interacting residues, it may be envisaged to interact with TFIIF upon approaching by the proteins. It is reasonable to expect this loop structure to undergo conformational changes when interacting with TFIIF, and such flexibility would be consistent with the aforementioned suggestion that it is partially disordered in the crystal lattice of 10-subunit Pol II. The peptide segment between Lys-134 and Lys-164 in the same region (Fig. 3C) remains disordered, as no density could be seen for it. Conformation of the TFIIE-Interacting Clamp Top—The newly modeled Rpb1 region from Lys-187 to Asp-195 completes a gap at the top of Rpb1 Clamp domain (Fig. 3D, red). The Clamp interacts extensively with both DNA and RNA in the transcription elongation complex (17Kettenberger H. Armache K.J. Cramer P. Mol. Cell. 2004; 16: 955-965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar, 36Gnatt A.L. Cramer P. Fu J. Bushnell D.A. Kornberg R.D. Science. 2001; 292: 1876-1882Crossref PubMed Scopus (744) Google Scholar) and cross-links with TFIIE in assembled pre-initiation complex (21Chen H.T. Warfield L. Hahn S. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2007; 14: 696-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). This loop structure is delineated in space by two TFIIE-cross-linking sites, Asn-169 and Leu-199 of Rpb1, the blue sites next to the Clamp Top (Fig. 3B). The shortest distances from residues in Clamp Top to Asn-169 and Leu-199 are 11 and 13 Å, respectively. The loop folds over by ∼90°. Similar to the other protrusion loops, the Clamp Top structure is expected to interact with TFIIE and possibly undergo conformational alterations when doing so. Conformational Movement and Dynamics of Fork Loop-1—We have observed electron density for Fork Loop-1 (Rpb2 461–480) in the 12-subunit Pol II uncomplexed with nucleic acids and placed a main-chain model for the loop (15Meyer P.A. Ye P. Zhang M. Suh M.H. Fu J. Structure. 2006; 14: 973-982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). We are now able to refine a complete model of Fork Loop-1 in free Pol II. After refinement with SAD data, the 2Fo-Fc omit map showed well defined density for the loop (Fig. 2C, right), whereas the previous 2Fo-Fc map based on unrefined model failed to do so (15Meyer P.A. Ye P. Zhang M. Suh M.H. Fu J. Structure. 2006; 14: 973-982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). This is an indication of improvement of the current model as a result of the refinement performed in this work. In the ternary complex with DNA/RNA, Fork Loop-1 (FL-1) interacts with both the RNA and the loop structure named “Rudder” (Rpb1 310–324), which is a part of the Rpb1 clamp domain (9Westover K.D. Bushnell D.A. Kornberg R.D. Science. 2004; 303: 1014-1016Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). In the refined structure of free Pol II, FL-1 also contacts Rudder. Solvent-accessible surfaces of the two loop structures merge at their closest point of interaction (Fig. 4A, surfaces). A distance of 3.9 Å is found between the amide of Lys-470 in Fork Loop-1 and the carbonyl of Gly-319 in Rudder (Fig. 4A, pink dashed line), suggesting that the main-chain groups may potentially serve as a pair of hydrogen-bond donor and acceptor or candidates for water-mediated hydrogen-bond interaction. The two loop structures approach one another from opposite sides of the nucleic acid binding cleft, forming a gate-like barrier that separates the cleft into two compartments, the DNA/RNA hybrid binding tunnel behind the gate of Fork Loop-1/Rudder and the downstream DNA duplex binding channel that lies perpendicularly down the hybrid binding tunnel as described previously (15Meyer P.A. Ye P. Zhang M. Suh M.H. Fu J. Structure. 2006; 14: 973-982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Although Rudder maintains the same conformation in all of the reported structures (Fig. 4B, gray), Fork Loop-1 adopts one of the two main conformations observed in each of the crystals of Pol II-DNA/RNA ternary complexes, differing primarily in their distance to Rudder. Compared with its conformations in representative structures that contained DNA/RNA (Fig. 4B, yellow and red models), Fork Loop-1 in unengaged Pol II (cyan) shifts toward the floor of the downstream-DNA cleft by ∼7 Å at its tip. Identities of the facing residues from each loop vary accordingly (Table 2). Together, these structures define the range at which the Fork Loop-1 conformation may fluctuate when engaging the single-stranded DNA or DNA/RNA hybrid during transcription initiation or elongation, respectively. Transient opening of the gate by Fork Loop-1 changing its conformation was first pointed out in our earlier work as a necessary step involved in the formation of open promoter complex and the process of transcription initiation (15Meyer P.A. Ye P. Zhang M. Suh M.H. Fu J. Structure. 2006; 14: 973-982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Based on the structural information from both the free and DNA/RNA bound Pol IIs, we suggest that the basic residues Lys-470 and Lys-471 of Rpb2, which are located at the edge of Fork Loop-1 facing Rudder, play important roles in engaging template DNA during initiation and in stabilizing DNA/RNA hybrid during elongation. In particular, we suggest that the gate of Fork Loop-1/Rudder may “lock” into a more stable interaction after the formation of the nascent RNA (longer than eight bases); the non-coding DNA strand may, thus, be kept separate from the coding strand to prevent collapse of the transcription bubble (9Westover K.D. Bushnell D.A. Kornberg R.D. Science. 2004; 303: 1014-1016Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). This mechanism is consistent with the observation that deletion of the two residues in the Fork Loop-1 edge of mammalian Pol II that face Rudder (equivalent to Lys-471—Ala-472 in yeast Pol II) results in a loss of transcription activity (37Jeronimo C.

https://openalex.org/W1998128885,"Eukaryotic cap-dependent mRNA translation is mediated by the initiation factor eIF4E, which binds mRNAs and stimulates efficient translation initiation. eIF4E is often overexpressed in human cancers. To elucidate the molecular signature of eIF4E target mRNAs, we analyzed sequence and structural properties of two independently derived polyribosome recruited mRNA datasets. These datasets originate from studies of mRNAs that are actively being translated in response to cells over-expressing eIF4E or cells with an activated oncogenic AKT: eIF4E signaling pathway, respectively. Comparison of eIF4E target mRNAs to mRNAs insensitive to eIF4E-regulation has revealed surprising features in mRNA secondary structure, length and microRNA-binding properties. Fold-changes (the relative change in recruitment of an mRNA to actively translating polyribosomal complexes in response to eIF4E overexpression or AKT upregulation) are positively correlated with mRNA G+C content and negatively correlated with total and 3'UTR length of the mRNAs. A machine learning approach for predicting the fold change was created. Interesting tendencies of secondary structure stability are found near the start codon and at the beginning of the 3'UTR region. Highly upregulated mRNAs show negative selection (site avoidance) for binding sites of several microRNAs. These results are consistent with the emerging model of regulation of mRNA translation through a dynamic balance between translation initiation at the 5'UTR and microRNA binding at the 3'UTR."
https://openalex.org/W2025938145,"Critical to the development of molecular signatures from microarray and other high-throughput data is testing the statistical significance of the produced signature in order to ensure its statistical reproducibility. While current best practices emphasize sufficiently powered univariate tests of differential expression, little is known about the factors that affect the statistical power of complex multivariate analysis protocols for high-dimensional molecular signature development.We show that choices of specific components of the analysis (i.e., error metric, classifier, error estimator and event balancing) have large and compounding effects on statistical power. The effects are demonstrated empirically by an analysis of 7 of the largest microarray cancer outcome prediction datasets and supplementary simulations, and by contrasting them to prior analyses of the same data.THE FINDINGS OF THE PRESENT STUDY HAVE TWO IMPORTANT PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS: First, high-throughput studies by avoiding under-powered data analysis protocols, can achieve substantial economies in sample required to demonstrate statistical significance of predictive signal. Factors that affect power are identified and studied. Much less sample than previously thought may be sufficient for exploratory studies as long as these factors are taken into consideration when designing and executing the analysis. Second, previous highly-cited claims that microarray assays may not be able to predict disease outcomes better than chance are shown by our experiments to be due to under-powered data analysis combined with inappropriate statistical tests."
https://openalex.org/W2085744572,"Scrotal hernia in pigs is a complex trait likely affected by genetic and environmental factors. A large-scale association analysis of positional and functional candidate genes was conducted in four previously identified genomic regions linked to hernia susceptibility on Sus scrofa chromosomes 2 and 12, as well as the fifth region around 67 cM on chromosome 2, respectively. In total, 151 out of 416 SNPs discovered were genotyped successfully. Using a family-based analysis we found that four regions surrounding ELF5, KIF18A, COL23A1 on chromosome 2, and NPTX1 on chromosome 12, respectively, may contain the genetic variants important for the development of the scrotal hernia in pigs. These findings were replicated in another case-control dataset. The SNPs around the ELF5 region were in high linkage disequilibrium with each other, and a haplotype containing SNPs from ELF5 and CAT was highly significantly associated with hernia development. Extensive re-sequencing work focused on the KIF18A gene did not detect any further SNPs with extensive association signals. These genes may be involved in the estrogen receptor signaling pathway (KIF18A and NPTX1), the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (ELF5) and the collagen metabolism pathway (COL23A1), which are associated with the important molecular characteristics of hernia pathophysiology. Further investigation on the molecular mechanisms of these genes may provide more molecular clues on hernia development in pigs."
https://openalex.org/W2065962202,"Protein-disulfide isomerase (PDI), an endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-resident protein, is primarily known as a catalyst of oxidative protein folding but also has a protein unfolding activity. We showed previously that PDI unfolds the cholera toxin A1 (CTA1) polypeptide to facilitate the ER-to-cytosol retrotranslocation of the toxin during intoxication. We now provide insight into the mechanism of this unfoldase activity. PDI includes two redox-active (a and a') and two redox-inactive (b and b') thioredoxin-like domains, a linker (x), and a C-terminal domain (c) arranged as abb'xa'c. Using recombinant PDI fragments, we show that binding of CTA1 by the continuous PDIbb'xa' fragment is necessary and sufficient to trigger unfolding. The specific linear arrangement of bb'xa' and the type a domain (a' versus a) C-terminal to bb'x are additional determinants of activity. These data suggest a general mechanism for the unfoldase activity of PDI: the concurrent and specific binding of bb'xa' to particular regions along the CTA1 molecule triggers its unfolding. Furthermore, we show the bb' domains of PDI are indispensable to the unfolding reaction, whereas the function of its a' domain can be substituted partially by the a' domain from ERp57 (abb'xa'c) or ERp72 (ca degrees abb'xa'), PDI-like proteins that do not unfold CTA1 normally. However, the bb' domains of PDI were insufficient to convert full-length ERp57 into an unfoldase because the a domain of ERp57 inhibited toxin binding. Thus, we propose that generating an unfoldase from thioredoxin-like domains requires the bb'(x) domains of PDI followed by an a' domain but not preceded by an inhibitory a domain."
https://openalex.org/W2106216745,"Accurate identification of promoter regions and transcription start sites (TSS) in genomic DNA allows for a more complete understanding of the structure of genes and gene regulation within a given genome. Many recently published methods have achieved high identification accuracy of TSS. However, models providing more accurate modeling of promoters and TSS are needed. A novel identification method for identifying transcription start sites that improves the accuracy of TSS recognition for recently published methods is proposed. This method incorporates a metric feature based on oligonucleotide positional frequencies, taking into account the nature of promoters. A radial basis function neural network for identifying transcription start sites (RBF-TSS) is proposed and employed as a classification algorithm. Using non-overlapping chunks (windows) of size 50 and 500 on the human genome, the proposed method achieves an area under the Receiver Operator Characteristic curve (auROC) of 94.75% and 95.08% respectively, providing increased performance over existing TSS prediction methods."
https://openalex.org/W1979857218,"Botulism, an often fatal neuroparalytic disease, is caused by botulinum neurotoxins (BoNT) which consist of a family of seven serotypes (A-H) produced by the anaerobic bacterium Clostridium botulinum. BoNT, considered the most potent biological toxin known, is a 150 kDa protein consisting of a 100 kDa heavy-chain (Hc) and a 50 kDa light-chain (Lc). F1-40 is a mouse-derived, IgG1 monoclonal antibody that binds the light chain of BoNT serotype A (BoNT/A) and is used in a sensitive immunoassay for toxin detection. We report the fine epitope mapping of F1-40 and the deduced amino acid sequence of the variable regions of the heavy and light chains of the antibody.To characterize the binding epitope of F1-40, three complementary experimental approaches were selected. Firstly, recombinant peptide fragments of BoNT/A light-chain were used in Western blots to identify the epitope domains. Secondly, a peptide phage-display library was used to identify the specific amino acid sequences. Thirdly, the three-dimensional structure of BoNT/A was examined in silico, and the amino acid sequences determined from the phage-display studies were mapped onto the three-dimensional structure in order to visualize the epitope. F1-40 was found to bind a peptide fragment of BoNT/A, designated L1-3, which spans from T125 to L200. The motif QPDRS was identified by phage-display, and was mapped to a region within L1-3. When the three amino acids Q138, P139 and D140 were all mutated to glycine, binding of F1-40 to the recombinant BoNT/A light chain peptide was abolished. Q-138, P-139 and D-140 form a loop on the external surface of BoNT/A, exposed to solvent and accessible to F1-40 binding.The epitope of F1-40 was localized to a single exposed loop (ss4, ss5) on the Lc of BoNT. Furthermore amino acids Q138, P139 and D140 forming the tip of the loop appear critical for binding."
https://openalex.org/W2078095097,"A critical process that builds and maintains the eukaryotic cilium is intraflagellar transport (IFT). This process utilizes members of the kinesin-2 superfamily to transport cargo into the cilium (anterograde transport) and a dynein motor for the retrograde traffic. Using a novel RNAi knockdown method, we have analyzed the function of the homodimeric IFT kinesin-2, Kin5, in Tetrahymena ciliary transport. In RNAi transformants, Kin5 was severely downregulated and disappeared from the cilia, but cilia did not resorb, although tip structure was affected. After deciliation of the knockdown cell, cilia regrew and cells swam, which suggested that Kin5 is not responsible for the trafficking of axonemal precursors to build the cilium, but could be transporting molecules that act in ciliary signal transduction, such as guanine nucleotide exchange proteins (GEFs). Gef1 is a Tetrahymena ciliary protein, and current coimmunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence studies showed that it is absent in regrowing cilia of the knockdown cells lacking ciliary Kin5. We suggest that one important cargo of Kin5 is Gef1 and knockdown of Kin5 results in cell lethality."
https://openalex.org/W2019115020,"Cytokinesis in animal cells requires the assembly of an actomyosin contractile ring to cleave the cell. The ring is highly dynamic; it assembles and disassembles during each cell cleavage, resulting in the recurrent redistribution of actin. To investigate this process in grasshopper spermatocytes, we mechanically manipulated the spindle to induce actin redistribution into ectopic contractile rings, around reassembled lateral spindles. To enhance visualization of actin, we folded the spindle at its equator to convert the remnants of the partially assembled ring into a concentrated source of actin. Filaments from the disintegrating ring aligned along reorganizing spindle microtubules, suggesting that their incorporation into the new ring was mediated by microtubules. We tracked incorporation by speckling actin filaments with Qdots and/or labeling them with Alexa 488-phalloidin. The pattern of movement implied that actin was transported along spindle microtubules, before entering the ring. By double-labeling dividing cells, we imaged actin filaments moving along microtubules near the contractile ring. Together, our findings indicate that in one mechanism of actin redistribution, actin filaments are transported along spindle microtubule tracks in a plus-end-directed fashion. After reaching the spindle midzone, the filaments could be transported laterally to the ring. Notably, actin filaments undergo a dramatic trajectory change as they enter the ring, implying the existence of a pulling force. Two other mechanisms of actin redistribution, cortical flow and de novo assembly, are also present in grasshopper, suggesting that actin converges at the nascent contractile ring from diffuse sources within the cytoplasm and cortex, mediated by spindle microtubules."

https://openalex.org/W2071384497,"Proper cellular function requires uptake of small molecules from the environment. In response to changes in extracellular conditions cells alter the import and utilization of small molecules. For a wide variety of small molecules the cellular response is regulated by a network motif that combines two feedback loops, one which regulates the transport and the other which regulates the subsequent metabolism.We analyze the dynamic behavior of two widespread but logically distinct two-loop motifs. These motifs differ in the logic of the feedback loop regulating the uptake of the small molecule. Our aim is to examine the qualitative features of the dynamics of these two classes of feedback motifs. We find that the negative feedback to transport is accompanied by overshoot in the intracellular amount of small molecules, whereas a positive feedback to transport removes overshoot by boosting the final steady state level. On the other hand, the negative feedback allows for a rapid initial response, whereas the positive feedback is slower. We also illustrate how the dynamical deficiencies of one feedback motif can be mitigated by an additional loop, while maintaining the original steady-state properties.Our analysis emphasizes the core of the regulation found in many motifs at the interface between the metabolic network and the environment of the cell. By simplifying the regulation into uptake and the first metabolic step, we provide a basis for elaborate studies of more realistic network structures. Particularly, this theoretical analysis predicts that FeS cluster formation plays an important role in the dynamics of iron homeostasis."
