https://openalex.org/W2507823639,"The composition, size distribution, and abundance of floating plastic debris in surface waters of the Mediterranean Sea were analyzed in relation to distance to land. We combined data from previously published reports with an intensive sampling in inshore waters of the Northwestern Mediterranean. The highest plastic concentrations were found in regions distant from from land as well as in the first kilometer adjacent to the coastline. In this nearshore water strip, plastic concentrations were significantly correlated with the nearness to a coastal human population, with local areas close to large human settlements showing hundreds of thousands of plastic pieces per km2. The ratio of plastic to plankton abundance reached particularly high values for the coastal surface waters. Polyethylene, polypropylene and polyamides were the predominant plastic polymers at all distances from coast (86 to 97% of total items), although the diversity of polymers was higher in the 1-km coastal water strip due to a higher frequency of polystyrene or polyacrylic fibers. The plastic size distributions showed a gradual increase in abundance toward small sizes indicating an efficient removal of small plastics from the surface. Nevertheless, the relative abundance of small fragments (< 2 mm) was higher within the 1-km coastal water strip, suggesting a rapid fragmentation down along the shoreline, likely related with the washing ashore on the beaches. This study constitutes a first attempt to determine the impact of plastic debris in areas closest to Mediterranean coast. The presence of a high concentration of plastic including tiny plastic items could have significant environmental, health and economic impacts."

We applied a target enrichment and next-generation sequencing protocol to generate ultraconserved elements (UCEs) from 51 large carpenter bee specimens (genus Xylocopa), representing 25 species with specimen ages ranging from 2-121 years. We measured the correlation between specimen age and DNA yield (pre- and post-library preparation DNA concentration) and several UCE sequence capture statistics (raw read count, UCE reads on target, UCE mean contig length and UCE locus count) with linear regression models. We performed piecewise regression to test for specific breakpoints in the relationship of specimen age and DNA yield and sequence capture variables. Additionally, we compared UCE data from newer and older specimens of the same species and reconstructed their phylogeny in order to confirm the validity of our data. We recovered 6-972 UCE loci from samples with pre-library DNA concentrations ranging from 0.06-9.8 ng/μL. All investigated DNA yield and sequence capture variables were significantly but only moderately negatively correlated with specimen age. Specimens of age 20 years or less had significantly higher pre- and post-library concentrations, UCE contig lengths, and locus counts compared to specimens older than 20 years. We found breakpoints in our data indicating a decrease of the initial detrimental effect of specimen age on pre- and post-library DNA concentration and UCE contig length starting around 21-39 years after preservation. Our phylogenetic results confirmed the integrity of our data, giving preliminary insights into relationships within Xylocopa. We consider the effect of additional factors not measured in this study on our age-related sequence capture results, such as DNA fragmentation and preservation method, and discuss the promise of the UCE approach for large-scale projects in insect phylogenomics using museum specimens."
https://openalex.org/W2513933507,"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a rapidly progressive neurodegenerative disease. Executive dysfunction is common in patients with ALS, with up to 50% of patients performing within an impaired range. There is evidence that social cognitive deficits associated with ALS are a function of deficits in executive function. The 'Reading the Mind in the Eyes' Test is a recognized test of social cognitive function, although the reliability of this instrument remains to be established.Patients with ALS (n = 106), and age and IQ matched controls (n = 50) were recruited and asked to perform the Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test as part of an on-going population-based study of cognitive function. ALS patients were sub-stratified based on the presence, and/or extent of executive dysfunction.Cronbach's Alpha of .73 was observed, indicating good reliability on this measure. Split-half reliability analysis further confirms these findings (p = 0.826). The Reading the Mind in the Eyes test had excellent psychometric properties when discriminating between ALS patients who are cognitively intact, and those who have executive impairment, with an overall medium difficulty. There was a large magnitude significant difference between patients and controls (p< 0.001; η2 = .19). Post-hoc analysis revealed that controls performed significantly higher than patients with executive impairment (p< 0.001), and patients with single executive deficits (p = 0.002).Executive dysfunction impacts on social cognitive performance. This study contributes not only to the psychometric knowledge of this measure, but also to the usability, efficacy, and reliability of social cognitive assessment in ALS. Using population-specific normative data, we confirm the Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test is a reliable measure of social cognitive processes in ALS."
https://openalex.org/W2511577975,"Objective Hypertension is the major driver of the cardiovascular epidemic facing Indonesia in the 21st century. Understanding the socioeconomic inequalities associated with hypertension is essential for designing effective intervention strategies. The aim of the current study was to use sub-nationally representative survey data to examine socio-demographic inequalities in the prevalence, diagnosis and management of hypertension in Indonesian adults. Methods We investigated factors associated with hypertension prevalence, diagnosis, treatment and control using data on self-reported diagnosis and treatment, and blood pressure measurements, collected from 9755 respondents aged 40 years and up in the 2007 Indonesian Family Life Survey (IFLS 4). Results Age-standardized prevalence of hypertension among the study participants was 47.8% (95% CI: 46.8, 48.9), of which almost 70% were undiagnosed. Hypertension was significantly higher in women than men (52.3% versus 43.1%, p-value<0.001). Prevalence of hypertension increased significantly with ageing (Pfor trend <0.001). Over 91% (men: 92.1%, women: 90.0%) of hypertension cases were uncontrolled. Gender, education and socioeconomic status had differential impact on the diagnosis of hypertension and in receiving treatment. Conclusions Overall, less than a third were aware of their hypertension and a quarter of those on medication had their blood pressure effectively controlled. Men and those of younger age were more vulnerable to have undiagnosed and untreated hypertension. Substantial effort should be given to improve awareness about the condition and making provision for early diagnosis and treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2518202562,"Neutrophil [polymorphonuclear leukocyte (PMN)] transepithelial migration (TEM) is a hallmark of inflammatory mucosal disorders. PMN TEM is associated with epithelial injury; however, mechanisms involved in this process are not well defined. The current work describes a new mechanism whereby deposition of PMN membranederived microparticles (PMN-MPs) onto intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) during TEM leads to loss of epithelial cadherins, thus promoting epithelial injury and increased PMN recruitment. PMN-MPs secreted by activated PMNs during TEM displayed a high level of enzymatically activematrixmetalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9), and were capable of mediating potent effects on IEC integrity. Isolated PMN-MPs efficiently bound to IEC monolayers and induced cleavage of desmoglein-2 (DSG-2) but not E-cadherin, leading to disruption of IEC intercellular adhesions. Furthermore, PMN-MP binding to intestinal epithelium in vitro in transwell assays and in vivo in ligated intestinal loop preparations facilitated increases in PMN TEM. These effects were MMP-9 dependent and were reversed in the presence of specific pharmacological inhibitors. Finally, we demonstrated that IEC Dsg-2 serves as a barrier for migrating PMNs, and its removal by PMN-MP-associated MMP-9 facilitates PMNtrafficking across epithelial layers. Our findings thus implicate PMN-MPs in PMN-mediated inflammation and epithelial damage, as observed in inflammatory disorders ofmucosal surfaces.—Butin-Israeli, V., Houser, M.C., Feng, M., Thorp, E.

https://openalex.org/W2507802242,"A number of pathological conditions have been linked to mutations in the dopamine transporter gene, including hereditary dopamine transporter deficiency syndrome (DTDS). DTDS is a rare condition that is caused by autosomal recessive loss-of-function mutations in the dopamine transporter (DAT), which often affects transporter trafficking and folding. We examined the possibility of using pharmacological chaperones of DAT to rescue DTDS mutations. After screening a set of known DAT ligands for their ability to increase DAT surface expression, we found that bupropion and ibogaine increased DAT surface expression, whereas others, including cocaine and methylphenidate, had no effect. Bupropion and ibogaine increased wild type DAT protein levels and also promoted maturation of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-retained DAT mutant K590A. Rescue of K590A could be blocked by inhibiting ER to Golgi transport using brefeldin A. Furthermore, knockdown of coat protein complex II (COPII) component SEC24D, which is important in the ER export of wild type DAT, also blocked the rescue effects of bupropion and ibogaine. These data suggest that bupropion and ibogaine promote maturation of DAT by acting as pharmacological chaperones in the ER. Importantly, both drugs rescue DAT maturation and functional activity of the DTDS-associated mutations A314V and R445C. Together, these results are the first demonstration of pharmacological chaperoning of DAT and suggest this may be a viable approach to increase DAT levels in DTDS and other conditions associated with reduced DAT function.

https://openalex.org/W2514619247,"People believe they experience the world objectively, but research continually demonstrates that beliefs influence perception. Emerging research indicates that beliefs influence the experience of eating. In three studies, we test whether beliefs about how animals are raised can influence the experience of eating meat. Samples of meat were paired with descriptions of animals raised on factory farms or raised on humane farms. Importantly, the meat samples in both conditions were identical. However, participants experienced the samples differently: meat paired with factory farm descriptions looked, smelled, and tasted less pleasant. Even basic properties of flavor were influenced: factory farmed samples tasted more salty and greasy. Finally, actual behavior was influenced: participants consumed less when samples were paired with factory farm descriptions. These findings demonstrate that the experience of eating is not determined solely by physical properties of stimuli-beliefs also shape experience."
https://openalex.org/W2517166706,"Species of the genus Moina Baird (Cladocera: Moinidae) often dominate freshwater crustacean communities in temporary water bodies. Several species of Moina are used as food for fish larvae in aquaculture, as bioindicators in toxicological studies, and as common subjects for physiological studies. The aim of this paper is to estimate biodiversity of Moina in northern Eurasia using the standard DNA barcoding approach based on the cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) gene. We analysed 160 newly obtained and 157 existing COI sequences, and found evidence for 21 phylogroups of Moina, some of which were detected here for the first time. Our study confirmed the opinion that the actual species diversity of cladocerans is several times higher than is presently accepted. Our results also indicated that Moina has the second richest species diversity among the cladoceran genera (with only Daphnia O. F. Mueller having a greater diversity of species). Our study strongly supports division of Moina into two faunistic groups: European-Western Siberian and Eastern Siberian-Far Eastern, with a transitional zone at the Yenisey River basin (Eastern Siberia). Here, we refrain from taxonomic descriptions of new species, as this requires a thorough morphological and taxonomic study for each putative taxon."
https://openalex.org/W2512810124,"The impact that unbalanced sex ratios have on health and societal outcomes is of mounting contemporary concern. However, it is increasingly unclear whether it is male- or female-biased sex ratios that are associated with family and social instability. From a socio-demographic perspective, male-biased sex ratios leave many men unable to find a mate, elevating competition among males, disrupting family formation and negatively affecting social stability. In contrast, from a mating-market perspective, males are expected to be less willing to marry and commit to a family when the sex ratio is female-biased and males are rare. Here we use U.S. data to evaluate predictions from these competing frameworks by testing the relationship between the adult sex ratio and measures of family formation. We find that when women are rare men are more likely to marry, be part of a family and be sexually committed to a single partner. Our results do not support claims that male-biased sex ratios lead to negative family outcomes due to a surplus of unmarried men. Rather, our results highlight the need to pay increased attention to female-biased sex ratios."
https://openalex.org/W2512002337,"Video games that aim to improve myoelectric control (myogames) are gaining popularity and are often part of the rehabilitation process following an upper limb amputation. However, direct evidence for their effect on prosthetic skill is limited. This study aimed to determine whether and how myogaming improves EMG control and whether performance improvements transfer to a prosthesis-simulator task. Able-bodied right-handed participants (N = 28) were randomly assigned to 1 of 2 groups. The intervention group was trained to control a video game (Breakout-EMG) using the myosignals of wrist flexors and extensors. Controls played a regular Mario computer game. Both groups trained 20 minutes a day for 4 consecutive days. Before and after training, two tests were conducted: one level of the Breakout-EMG game, and grasping objects with a prosthesis-simulator. Results showed a larger increase of in-game accuracy for the Breakout-EMG group than for controls. The Breakout-EMG group moreover showed increased adaptation of the EMG signal to the game. No differences were found in using a prosthesis-simulator. This study demonstrated that myogames lead to task-specific myocontrol skills. Transfer to a prosthesis task is therefore far from easy. We discuss several implications for future myogame designs."
https://openalex.org/W2514913749,"The voltage dependent sodium channel Nav1.9, is expressed preferentially in peripheral sensory neurons and has been linked to human genetic pain disorders, which makes it target of interest for the development of new pain therapeutics. However, characterization of Nav1.9 pharmacology has been limited due in part to the historical difficulty of functionally expressing recombinant channels. Here we report the successful generation and characterization of human, mouse and rat Nav1.9 stably expressed in human HEK-293 cells. These cells exhibit slowly activating and inactivating inward sodium channel currents that have characteristics of native Nav1.9. Optimal functional expression was achieved by coexpression of Nav1.9 with β1/β2 subunits. While recombinantly expressed Nav1.9 was found to be sensitive to sodium channel inhibitors TC-N 1752 and tetracaine, potency was up to 100-fold less than reported for other Nav channel subtypes despite evidence to support an interaction with the canonical local anesthetic (LA) binding region on Domain 4 S6. Nav1.9 Domain 2 S6 pore domain contains a unique lysine residue (K799) which is predicted to be spatially near the local anesthetic interaction site. Mutation of this residue to the consensus asparagine (K799N) resulted in an increase in potency for tetracaine, but a decrease for TC-N 1752, suggesting that this residue can influence interaction of inhibitors with the Nav1.9 pore. In summary, we have shown that stable functional expression of Nav1.9 in the widely used HEK-293 cells is possible, which opens up opportunities to better understand channel properties and may potentially aid identification of novel Nav1.9 based pharmacotherapies."
https://openalex.org/W2510650522,"We have previously shown that fidaxomicin instillation prevents spore recovery in an in-vitro gut model, whereas vancomycin does not. The reasons for this are unclear. Here, we have investigated persistence of fidaxomicin and vancomycin on C. difficile spores, and examined post-antibiotic exposure spore recovery, outgrowth and toxin production.Prevalent UK C. difficile ribotypes (n = 10) were incubated with 200mg/L fidaxomicin, vancomycin or a non-antimicrobial containing control for 1 h in faecal filtrate or Phosphate Buffered Saline. Spores were washed three times with faecal filtrate or phosphate buffered saline, and residual spore-associated antimicrobial activity was determined by bioassay. For three ribotypes (027, 078, 015), antimicrobial-exposed, faecal filtrate-washed spores and controls were inoculated into broth. Viable vegetative and spore counts were enumerated on CCEYL agar. Percentage phase bright spores, phase dark spores and vegetative cells were enumerated by phase contrast microscopy at 0, 3, 6, 24 and 48 h post-inoculation. Toxin levels (24 and 48h) were determined by cell cytotoxicity assay.Fidaxomicin, but not vancomycin persisted on spores of all ribotypes following washing in saline (mean = 10.1mg/L; range = 4.0-14mg/L) and faecal filtrate (mean = 17.4mg/L; 8.4-22.1mg/L). Outgrowth and proliferation rates of vancomycin-exposed spores were similar to controls, whereas fidaxomicin-exposed spores showed no vegetative cell growth after 24 and 48 h. At 48h, toxin levels averaged 3.7 and 3.3 relative units (RU) in control and vancomycin-exposed samples, respectively, but were undetectable in fidaxomicin-exposed samples.Fidaxomicin persists on C. difficile spores, whereas vancomycin does not. This persistence prevents subsequent growth and toxin production in vitro. This may have implications on spore viability, thereby impacting CDI recurrence and transmission rates."

Biological membranes contain hundreds of lipid types, which differ in acyl chain length and degree of unsaturation, and head group polarity, size, and charge (1van Meer G. Voelker D.R. Feigenson G.W.

Such a complex lipid environment is essential to maintain the structural integrity and function of membrane proteins, which often have defined binding sites for lipids (2Lee A.G. How lipids affect the activities of integral membrane proteins.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1666: 62-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (938) Google Scholar).

Specific lipids are associated with the activity of membrane proteins, and their loss during protein purification usually results in aggregation or reduced transport and enzymatic activity. In recent years, there has been an increase in the numbers of membrane protein structures determined at medium to high resolution. Some of these structures show resolved lipids, which most probably are involved in specific interactions because they have survived the purification and crystallization processes. In many cases, no correlation between the structure and function of the specific lipids has been made. For the sarcoplasmic reticulum Na,K-ATPase (5Haviv H. Habeck M. Kanai R. Toyoshima C.

ABC transporters are one of the largest superfamilies found in eukaryotes, archaea, and prokaryotes. They are powered by the hydrolysis of ATP and can be classified as exporters and importers, the latter found only in bacteria. ABC exporters are associated with multidrug resistance in both bacterial and eukaryotic cells. To date, there are a few structures of ABC exporters, but none of these structures show well resolved specific lipids bound to them. Moreover, despite the importance of lipids, no detailed studies have linked their function to a specific lipid class. For example, the ABC exporter TmrAB, from Thermus thermophilus, is associated with phosphatidylglycerol (PG) and lipid A, as revealed by mass spectrometry (8Bechara C. Nöll A. Morgner N.

We have also shown that detergent-purified and proteoliposome-reconstituted McjD hydrolyzes ATP with a rate of 35 and 75 nmol/min/mg McjD, respectively (13Choudhury H.G. Tong Z. Mathavan I. Li Y. Iwata S. Zirah S. Rebuffat S. van Veen H.W. Beis K. Structure of an antibacterial peptide ATP-binding cassette transporter in a novel outward occluded state.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2014; 111: 9145-9150Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), suggesting that lipids are important for the ATPase activity. In light of these observations, we have combined functional and structural studies to characterize a specific class of lipids associated with the function of the ABC exporter McjD. Using non-denaturing and tandem mass spectrometry, we have identified specific lipids, phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) and PG, that are tightly bound to McjD and have survived the purification and remained associated to the protein in the gas phase. Because the E. coli inner membrane consists mainly of PE, PG, and cardiolipin (CARD), we performed basal and ligand-induced ATPase assays in detergent-destabilized small unilamellar vesicles with different lipid compositions, and we showed that both PE and PG rescued the ligand-induced ATPase activity of a delipidated McjD protein. These data were further verified by measuring the melting curves in the different lipids. Our structural data at 3.4 Å resolution revealed one resolved PG lipid. MD simulations performed on McjD embedded in different lipid environments provided molecular insights into the lipid organization in the proximity of the protein. Although zwitterionic (PE) and negatively charged lipids (PG) exchange to interact with the transporter, positively charged residues located on the protein surface provide preferable interactions sites for PG and CARD. Following expression and purification of McjD from E. coli, we used non-denaturing mass spectrometry to determine the oligomeric state of the protein and presence of any bound lipids. The mass spectrum of McjD solubilized in n-dodecyl β-d-maltopyranoside (DDM) resulted in a very broad peak even under relatively harsh activation conditions (supplemental Fig. S1). Mass spectral peaks of this width are usually assigned to the presence of endogenous lipids co-purified with the protein in the DDM micelle. These lipids resist delipidation with DDM implying that they have a relatively high affinity for McjD, and therefore, their interactions are preserved during the purification process. To reduce this heterogeneity of lipid binding, we carried out a detergent exchange from DDM into octyl glucose neopentyl glycol (OGNG). In this detergent, it was possible not to strip the micelle but also to resolve charge states of McjD (Fig. 1A). The deconvolution of these charge states showed a mass of 133 kDa, which is in agreement with the theoretical mass of dimeric McjD. A second series of peaks are assigned to adducts of mass ∼650–800 Da, likely phospholipids (discussed later). In addition to phospholipids, a second unexpected series of peaks with adduct masses of ∼3.3 kDa was observed. We attribute these adducts to lipopolysaccharides (LPS), in agreement with a recently published study where it was shown that MscL, an inner membrane protein, has the tendency to bind to outer membrane lipids or lipopolysaccharides (21Reading E. Walton T.A. Liko I. Marty M.T. Laganowsky A. Rees D.C. Robinson C.V. The effect of detergent, temperature, and lipid on the oligomeric state of MscL constructs: insights from mass spectrometry.Chem. Biol. 2015; 22: 593-603Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Given that LPS are larger than phospholipids or CARD, consisting of several hydrocarbon chains, their size implies hydrophobic binding to the surface of the protein. In agreement with this observation, our lasso-peptide binding experiment also shows that LPS does not obstruct the binding pocket but likely binds to the surface of the protein (Fig. 1B). Addition of ATP/Mg2+ did not show any displacement of the LPS (supplemental Fig. S1), and this is also consistent with LPS binding to the protein during purification rather than as a substrate, as shown recently for the ABC transporter TmrAB, which displaces lipid A on addition of ATP/Mg2+ (8Bechara C. Nöll A. Morgner N. Degiacomi M.T. Tampé R. Robinson C.V. A subset of annular lipids is linked to the flippase activity of an ABC transporter.Nat. Chem. 2015; 7: 255-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The presence of LPS is therefore likely irrelevant to the function of the protein because McjD is known as an antimicrobial peptide transporter. To answer the question whether binding of lipids to McjD has an effect on the function and stability of the protein, we investigated the presence of different lipids in DDM purified and OGNG-treated samples, and we identified them using tandem mass spectrometry (supplemental Fig. S1 and Table 1). The tandem mass spectrometry for the DDM purified McjD revealed a total of 11 lipid species of which two were negatively charged and nine were zwitterionic (Table 1). Treatment of McjD with OGNG resulted in the loss of several zwitterionic lipids (Table 1). We performed three replicate analyses of McjD preparations used for x-ray crystallization and found essentially similar results. Interestingly, we found several species of lipopolysaccharides, ranging from 3.3 to 3.4 kDa, consistent with the denaturing mass spectra of McjD. However, because of low signal intensity, we were unable to confirm the presence of LPS. Our lipid identification results suggest that McjD has selectivity toward zwitterionic and negatively charged lipids of varied chain lengths.TABLE 1List of identified phospholipid species bound to lipidated and delipidated McjDDDM (lipidated)OGNG (delipidated)PG(18:1/18:1)PG(18:1/18:1)PG(16:0/18:1)PG(16:0/18:1)PE(14:0/14:0)PE(14:0/14:0)PE(16:0/12:0)PE(14:0/17:1)PE(16:0/16:1)PE(18:1/16:1)PE(16:1/16:1)PE(16:0/14:0)PE(16:0/14:0)PE(18:1/18:1)PE(18:1/18:1)PE(16:0/18:1)PE(16:0/18:1) Open table in a new tab The mass spectrometry lipid identification and analysis showed the presence of PE and PG lipids (Table 1). Because these lipids have been retained, their roles could be to (i) stabilize the overall architecture of the protein or (ii) to have an effect on the activity of McjD. We investigated the effect of the different lipid types identified by mass spectrometry on the ATPase activity of McjD by partially delipidating it using OGNG (see “Materials and Methods”); McjD treated using this protocol will be referred to as delipidated McjD and the DDM-purified protein as DDM-lipidated. Extended delipidation of McjD resulted in aggregated/precipitated protein and total loss of the ATPase activity. Partial delipidation of McjD resulted in the loss of different chain length PE lipids (Table 1) and retention of PG. The basal ATPase activity of delipidated McjD was 20.77 ± 1.47 nmol/min/mg McjD, which is around 30% less active relative to the DDM-lipidated protein, 28.50 ± 0.39 nmol/min/mg McjD (Fig. 2A). When the delipidated protein was supplemented with detergent-destabilized small unilamellar vesicles composed of E. coli polar lipid extract (PL) (with a molar ratio of McjD to lipid of 1:870 mol/mol), the McjD basal ATPase activity was restored to similar levels as for the DDM-lipidated protein. Because the E. coli PL extract is a mixture of PE, PG, and CARD (6.7:3.2:0.1), the ATPase activity of delipidated McjD was measured in the presence of different detergent-destabilized small unilamellar vesicles composed of different lipids; we did not measure the activity in the presence of CARD because it was not detected in our analysis. PG was not able to fully restore the basal ATPase activity, whereas PE was able to restore it and also shows a slightly elevated ATPase activity, 33.05 ± 1.33 nmol/min/mg McjD, relative to the DDM-lipidated protein, 28.50 ± 0.39 nmol/min/mg McjD (Fig. 2A), which is in agreement with the loss of PE lipids upon delipidation. Because PE showed slightly elevated basal ATPase activity, we investigated which of its lipid components were responsible for the increased activity. PE is mostly composed of 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (16:0) (33.5% of the total PE composition) and 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (18:1) (34% of the total PE composition) in lipid preparations from E. coli. The mass spectrometry analysis identified different fragments of PE (Table 1), with variants of 1,2-dipalmitoleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (16:1) (9% of the total PE composition) and 18:1. Because not all mixed acyl variants are commercially available, we decided to assess only the effect of pure 16:1 PE and 18:1 PE lipids on the basal ATPase activity. In the presence of 16:1 PE or 18:1 PE, the basal ATPase activity was restored, but neither of them showed an elevated ATPase activity as did the PE mixture, thus suggesting a synergistic role of the different PE lipids present in the mixture in the McjD activity. We have previously shown that Hoechst33342 (Hoechst) can stimulate the ATPase activity of detergent-purified McjD, and it can also be transported by McjD in proteoliposomes (13Choudhury H.G. Tong Z. Mathavan I. Li Y. Iwata S. Zirah S. Rebuffat S. van Veen H.W. Beis K. Structure of an antibacterial peptide ATP-binding cassette transporter in a novel outward occluded state.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2014; 111: 9145-9150Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). In this study, Hoechst stimulated the DDM-lipidated and delipidated McjD by 2.1- and 1.6-fold, respectively, relative to the basal ATPase activity of the delipidated McjD (Fig. 2A). When delipidated McjD was supplemented with lipids, the ATPase activity in the presence of Hoechst almost doubled (calculated relative to the basal ATPase activity of delipidated McjD). The ligand stimulated ATPase activity in the presence of pure PE 18:1, and pure PE 16:1 was not measured because PE did not show enhanced stimulation compared with the other lipids. In the presence of Hoechst, the slightly higher (2.3-fold) ATPase activity in PL suggests a synergistic role of PE and PG in the activity and probably stability of McjD. Overall, in the presence of all the lipids, the ligand-induced ATPase activity was restored compared with the delipidated protein. Because the basal and ligand-stimulated ATPase activity of the delipidated protein was restored in the presence of various lipids, we sought to establish whether the different lipid environments stabilize the overall protein architecture by measuring the secondary structure and melting temperature (Tm) of McjD. The secondary structure of delipidated and lipid-supplemented McjD was monitored by Synchrotron Radiation Circular Dichroism (SRCD). The normalized far UV-CD spectra of DDM-lipidated McjD showed a typical α-helical structure, with an α-helix content of ∼68% (Fig. 2B and Table 2). This is in agreement with our previously published crystal structure in DDM (PDB code 4PL0), based on the Dictionary of Secondary Structure of Proteins (DSSP) algorithm (22Kabsch W. Sander C.

Delipidation of McjD (in OGNG) resulted in a less folded structure with a higher content of β-strand (26%) and a significant reduction in α-helical content (29%) compared with lipidated McjD (in DDM) (68%) (Table 2). McjD supplemented with PL, PE, and PG showed similar CD features to that in DDM, with a comparable α-helix content of 64–68% (Table 2), suggesting that the lipids are capable of reverting the loss of the secondary structure. Slight differences in α-helical content in PL may be due to the presence of a small ratio of CARD.TABLE 2Secondary structure estimation from CD spectra of McjD in various lipid conditions using Contin algorithmSecondary structure estimation (%)DDMOGNGPLPGPE4PL0 (DSSP)α-Helix68.329.164.266.868.562β-Strand2.926.45.42.93.910Turns10.019.912.611.211.116 (turns and bend)Unordered18.824.617.81916.412Standard deviation0.0120.0430.0370.0210.033 Open table in a new tab We also measured the thermal stability of McjD in the different lipid environments by SRCD as a function of secondary structure loss upon heating. DDM-lipidated McjD has a mean S.E. of 67.2 °C, and removal of lipids by OGNG destabilizes McjD dramatically, reducing its Tm to 48.6 °C (Fig. 2, C and D, and Table 3). When McjD was supplemented with PL, the thermal stability was recovered, and its Tm increased to 65.2 °C (Table 3). This trend of stability was also observed in the presence of PE, whose Tm (68.9 °C) is the closest to that of DDM-lipidated McjD and with PG, which has two transitions, the second one being the higher Tm at 74.3 °C. PG has another lower thermal transition at 13.1 °C (Table 3). This trend of thermal denaturation is mirrored in the α-helix contents of the McjD in the various lipid conditions. The α-helix component in McjD in various lipids (PL, PG, and PE) gave higher Tm (>70 °C) compared with McjD in DDM (67.2 °C), suggesting that other secondary structure components of McjD were likely perturbed before the α-helix content was affected.TABLE 3Tm of McjD in various lipid conditions monitored from far-UV CD spectra, at 224 nm and as a function of % α-helix, and nano-DSF as a ratio of 350:/330 nmLipids usedTm (ΔΔϵ224 nm) °CTm (% α-helix) °CTm (350/330 nm) °CDDM67.266.153.7Polar lipids (PL)65.271.463.2OGNG48.646.9Tm1 ND; Tm2 71.4PGTm1 13.1; Tm2 74.3Tm1 9.4; Tm2 76.054.4PE68.972.868.5PE 16:1Not measuredNot measured65.7PE 18:1Not measuredNot measured63.2 Open table in a new tab We also measured the stability of the delipidated and lipid-supplemented McjD using differential scanning fluorimetry (nano-DSF) by monitoring the intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence. McjD contains two tryptophans, Trp-167 and Trp-247, which are located in the head group region of the lipid bilayer. Changes in their local environment upon denaturation would affect their intrinsic fluorescence. The Tm of the DDM-lipidated McjD was measured to be 53.7 ± 0.3 °C (Fig. 3A and Table 3). The delipidated McjD displayed a biphasic profile (Fig. 3B and Table 3), suggesting that the protein was rather unstable, partially unfolded, at the beginning of the experiment. Because the assay started at 20 °C, we could not establish the first unfolding Tm event, but a secondary Tm was measured at 71.4 ± 0.5 °C (Fig. 3B). Supplementing the delipidated protein with PL showed an enhanced Tm stabilization, 63.2 ± 0.1 °C (Fig. 3C and Table 3) relative to the lipidated protein as well as absence of the biphasic profile (Fig. 3B). The two main components of the polar lipid extract PE and PG displayed Tm of 68.5 ± 0.3 and 54.4 ± 0.2 °C, respectively (Fig. 3, D and E, and Table 3). The PE shows a small degree of biphasic profile, which could correspond to some partially unstable protein. Finally, the Tm of McjD in the presence of 16:1 and 18:1, the two components of PE, were 65.7 ± 0.3 and 63.2 ± 0.3 °C (Fig. 3, F and G, and Table 3). All the lipids appear to have rescued/reduced the biphasic profile that the delipidated protein displayed, suggesting a possible role in stabilizing the local environment of tryptophans. Our current biochemical data show that the ATPase activity of McjD is strongly correlated and dependent toward the presence of lipids. We have previously determined the crystal structure of McjD, and we observed some electron density that could correspond to lipids. The electron density was not continuous, and it did not provide us with confidence to build any lipids. A structural study to identify bound lipids on SERCA employed the measurement and inclusion of low resolution diffraction spots in the refinement and map calculations (6Sonntag Y. Musgaard M. Olesen C. Schiøtt B. Møller J.V. Nissen P. Thøgersen L. Mutual adaptation of a membrane protein and its lipid bilayer during conformational changes.Nat. Commun. 2011; 2: 304Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). We followed a similar approach, and we used the same purified McjD batch for crystallization as for the mass spectrometry to compare the identified lipids with the crystal structure. We determined the crystal structure of McjD in the presence of AMPPNP and MgCl2 at 3.4 Å resolution, including low diffraction data to 60 Å resolution (Table 4). The overall structure is identical to our previously published one; McjD is in a nucleotide-bound outward occluded conformation. Inspection of electron density maps revealed the presence of elongated positive |Fo| − |Fc| electron density at 2.0 σ near the elbow helix and between TM3 and 4 (Fig. 4, A and B) of one subunit; the electron density was assigned as a PG molecule. We excluded the presence of DDM, as its alkyl chain is not long enough to occupy the electron density.

Comparison of the human PANK3·acetyl-CoA complex to the structures of PANK3 in four catalytically relevant complexes, 5′-adenylyl-β,γ-imidodiphosphate (AMPPNP)·Mg2+, AMPPNP·Mg2+·pantothenate, ADP·Mg2+·phosphopantothenate, and AMP phosphoramidate (AMPPN)·Mg2+, revealed a large conformational change in the dimeric enzyme. The amino-terminal nucleotide binding domain rotates to close the active site, and this allows the P-loop to engage ATP and facilitates required substrate/product interactions at the active site. Biochemical analyses showed that the transition between the inactive and active conformations, as assessed by the binding of either ATP·Mg2+ or acyl-CoA to PANK3, is highly cooperative indicating that both protomers move in concert. PANK3(G19V) cannot bind ATP, and biochemical analyses of an engineered PANK3/PANK3(G19V) heterodimer confirmed that the two active sites are functionally coupled. The communication between the two protomers is mediated by an α-helix that interacts with the ATP-binding site at its amino terminus and with the substrate/inhibitor-binding site of the opposite protomer at its carboxyl terminus. The two α-helices within the dimer together with the bound ligands create a ring that stabilizes the assembly in either the active closed conformation or the inactive open conformation. Thus, both active sites of the dimeric mammalian pantothenate kinases coordinately switch between the on and off states in response to intracellular concentrations of ATP and its key negative regulators, acetyl(acyl)-CoA."
https://openalex.org/W2518075538,"Cooperation amongst resource users holds the key to overcoming the social dilemma that characterizes community-based common-pool resource management. But is cooperation alone enough to achieve sustainable resource use? The short answer is no. Developing management strategies in a complex social-ecological environment also requires ecological knowledge and approaches to deal with perceived environmental uncertainty. Recent behavioral experimental research indicates variation in the degree to which a group of users can identify a sustainable exploitation level. In this paper, we identify social-ecological micro-foundations that facilitate cooperative sustainable common-pool resource use. We do so by using an agent-based model (ABM) that is informed by behavioral common-pool resource experiments. In these experiments, groups that cooperate do not necessarily manage the resource sustainably, but also over- or underexploit. By reproducing the patterns of the behavioral experiments in a qualitative way, the ABM represents a social-ecological explanation for the experimental observations. We find that the ecological knowledge of each group member cannot sufficiently explain the relationship between cooperation and sustainable resource use. Instead, the development of a sustainable exploitation level depends on the distribution of ecological knowledge among the group members, their influence on each other's knowledge, and the environmental uncertainty the individuals perceive. The study provides insights about critical social-ecological micro-foundations underpinning collective action and sustainable resource management. These insights may inform policy-making, but also point to future research needs regarding the mechanisms of social learning, the development of shared management strategies and the interplay of social and ecological uncertainty."

https://openalex.org/W2517136081,"Ischemic heart disease is a major cause of death and morbidity and the search for novel therapeutic targets is still required. We have previously shown that the enzyme arachidonate 15 lipoxygenase (ALOX15), which catalyzes the conversion of arachidonic acid to 15-hydroxy eicosatetraenoic acid (15-HETE), is highly expressed in ischemic heart tissue, but its role in the pathogenesis of ischemic heart disease is unclear. Here we showed that expression of ALOX15, but not ALOX12 or ALOX15B, was increased in ischemic versus non-ischemic human heart biopsy samples. A similar ALOX expression pattern was found in hypoxic human cardiomyocytes and cardiac endothelial cells. We also showed that levels of 15-HETE were significantly higher in ischemic versus non-ischemic human heart biopsy samples and showed a tendency to increase in serum from the patients with ischemic heart disease. Moreover, hypoxia increased the production of 15-HETE levels from human cardiomyocytes and cardiac endothelial cells. The hypoxia-induced increase in 15-HETE levels from human cardiomyocytes was inhibited by the ALOX15 inhibitor baicalein. Finally, by using intrinsic rotational thromboelastometry, we showed that human whole blood clotted faster in the presence of 15-HETE. In summary, we propose that increased ALOX15 expression in heart tissue under ischemic conditions may lead to increased production of 15-HETE, potentially contributing to thrombosis."
https://openalex.org/W2507801133,"Activated autologous platelet-rich plasma (PRP) used in therapeutic wound healing applications is poorly characterized and standardized. Using pulsed electric fields (PEF) to activate platelets may reduce variability and eliminate complications associated with the use of bovine thrombin. We previously reported that exposing PRP to sub-microsecond duration, high electric field (SMHEF) pulses generates a greater number of platelet-derived microparticles, increased expression of prothrombotic platelet surfaces, and differential release of growth factors compared to thrombin. Moreover, the platelet releasate produced by SMHEF pulses induced greater cell proliferation than plasma.To determine whether sub-microsecond duration, low electric field (SMLEF) bipolar pulses results in differential activation of PRP compared to SMHEF, with respect to profiles of activation markers, growth factor release, and cell proliferation capacity.PRP activation by SMLEF bipolar pulses was compared to SMHEF pulses and bovine thrombin. PRP was prepared using the Harvest SmartPreP2 System from acid citrate dextrose anticoagulated healthy donor blood. PEF activation by either SMHEF or SMLEF pulses was performed using a standard electroporation cuvette preloaded with CaCl2 and a prototype instrument designed to take into account the electrical properties of PRP. Flow cytometry was used to assess platelet surface P-selectin expression, and annexin V binding. Platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), endothelial growth factor (EGF) and platelet factor 4 (PF4), and were measured by ELISA. The ability of supernatants to stimulate proliferation of human epithelial cells in culture was also evaluated. Controls included vehicle-treated, unactivated PRP and PRP with 10 mM CaCl2 activated with 1 U/mL bovine thrombin.PRP activated with SMLEF bipolar pulses or thrombin had similar light scatter profiles, consistent with the presence of platelet-derived microparticles, platelets, and platelet aggregates whereas SMHEF pulses primarily resulted in platelet-derived microparticles. Microparticles and platelets in PRP activated with SMLEF bipolar pulses had significantly lower annexin V-positivity than those following SMHEF activation. In contrast, the % P-selectin positivity and surface P-selectin expression (MFI) for platelets and microparticles in SMLEF bipolar pulse activated PRP was significantly higher than that in SMHEF-activated PRP, but not significantly different from that produced by thrombin activation. Higher levels of EGF were observed following either SMLEF bipolar pulses or SMHEF pulses of PRP than after bovine thrombin activation while VEGF, PDGF, and PF4 levels were similar with all three activating conditions. Cell proliferation was significantly increased by releasates of both SMLEF bipolar pulse and SMHEF pulse activated PRP compared to plasma alone.PEF activation of PRP at bipolar low vs. monopolar high field strength results in differential platelet-derived microparticle production and activation of platelet surface procoagulant markers while inducing similar release of growth factors and similar capacity to induce cell proliferation. Stimulation of PRP with SMLEF bipolar pulses is gentler than SMHEF pulses, resulting in less platelet microparticle generation but with overall activation levels similar to that obtained with thrombin. These results suggest that PEF provides the means to alter, in a controlled fashion, PRP properties thereby enabling evaluation of their effects on wound healing and clinical outcomes."

Based on over 200 published studies, this ABM describes interactions among 21 cells or cytokines and incorporates 226 experimental data sets and/or data estimates from those reports to simulate a mouse HIR in silico. Our simulated results reproduced dynamic patterns of HIR reported in the literature. As shown in vivo, our model also demonstrated that sepsis was highly related to the initial Salmonella dose and the presence of components of the adaptive immune system. We determined that high mobility group box-1, C-reactive protein, and the interleukin-10: tumor necrosis factor-α ratio, and CD4+ T cell: CD8+ T cell ratio, all recognized as biomarkers during HIR, significantly correlated with outcomes of HIR. During therapy-directed silico simulations, our results demonstrated that anti-agent intervention impacted the survival rates of septic individuals in a time-dependent manner. By specifying the infected species, source of infection, and site of infection, this ABM enabled us to reproduce the kinetics of several essential indicators during a HIR, observe distinct dynamic patterns that are manifested during HIR, and allowed us to test proposed therapy-directed treatments. Although limitation still exists, this ABM is a step forward because it links underlying biological processes to computational simulation and was validated through a series of comparisons between the simulated results and experimental studies."

It was not known whether IGFBP-3 levels were altered in NAFLD, whether such alterations could be the result of lipotoxicity, and whether altered IGFBP-3 could affect pathways that are involved in hepatic and systemic inflammation. Serum IGFBP-3 was decreased in patients with NAFLD, whereas liver and circulating IL-8 levels were increased. Palmitate inhibited IGFBP-3 secretion by THP-1 macrophages and enhanced IL-8 expression. Exposure of palmitate-treated THP-1 macrophages to IGFBP-3-deficient conditioned medium led to a 20-fold increase in palmitate-induced IL-8 expression by hepatocytes. Conversely, overexpression of IGFBP-3 suppressed JNK and NF-κB activation and blocked palmitate-induced IL-8 expression in hepatocytes. Silencing IGFBP-3 in Huh7 cells enhanced JNK and NF-κB activity and increased palmitate-induced IL-8 secretion. These data indicate that IGFBP-3 serves as an anti-inflammatory brake in hepatocytes against JNK and NF-κB and limits their activation and downstream production of proinflammatory cytokines. Under lipotoxic conditions, palmitate inhibits hepatic macrophage secretion of IGFBP-3, thereby releasing the brake and enhancing palmitate-induced IL-8 synthesis and secretion.-Min, H.-K., Maruyama, H., Jang, B.

During infection, these peptides may play a role in the control of pathogens by providing protective antimicrobial barriers between epithelial cells and the hemocoel. The cDNAs encoding four defensins of the migratory locust, Locusta migratoria, designated LmDEF 1, 3–5, were identified for the first time by transcriptome-targeted analysis. Three of the members of this CSαβ defensin family, LmDEF 1, 3, and 5, were detected in locust tissues. The pro regions of their sequences have little-shared identities with other insect defensins, though the predicted mature peptides align well with other insect defensins. Phylogenetic analysis indicates a completely novel position of both LmDEF 1 and 3, compared to defensins from hymenopterans. The expression patterns of the genes encoding LmDEFs in the fat body and salivary glands were studied in response to immune-challenge by the microsporidian pathogen Nosema locustae and the fungus Metarhizium anisopliae after feeding or topical application, respectively. Focusing on Nosema-induced immunity, qRT-PCR was employed to quantify the transcript levels of LmDEFs. A higher transcript abundance of LmDEF5 was distributed more or less uniformly throughout the fat body along time. A very low baseline transcription of both LmDEFs 1 and 3 in naïve insects was indicated, and that transcription increases with time or is latent in the fat body or salivary glands of infected nymphs. In the salivary glands, expression of LmDEF3 was 20-40-times higher than in the fat body post-microbial infection. A very low expression of LmDEF3 could be detected in the fat body, but eventually increased with time up to a maximum at day 15. Delayed induction of transcription of these peptides in the fat body and salivary glands 5–15 days post-activation and the differential expression patterns suggest that the fat body/salivary glands of this species are active in the immune response against pathogens. The ability of N. locustae to induce salivary glands as well as fat body expression of defensins raises the possibility that these AMPs might play a key role in the development and/or tolerance of parasitic infections."
https://openalex.org/W2515937300,"Myocardial ventricular ischemia arises from a lack of blood supply to the heart, which may cause abnormal repolarization and excitation wave conduction patterns in the tissue, leading to cardiac arrhythmias and even sudden death. Current diagnosis of cardiac ischemia by the 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) has limitations as they are insensitive in many cases and may show unnoticeable differences to normal patterns. As the magnetic field provides extra information on cardiac excitation and is more sensitive to tangential currents to the surface of the chest, whereas the electric field is more sensitive to flux currents, it has been hypothesized that the magnetocardiogram (MCG) may provide a complementary method to the ECG in ischemic diagnosis. However, it is unclear yet about the differences in sensitivity regions of body surface ECG and MCG signals to ischemic conditions. The aim of this study was to investigate such differences by using 12-, 36- ECG and 36-MCG computed from multi-scale biophysically detailed computational models of the human ventricles and torso in both control and ischemic conditions. It was shown that ischemia produced changes in the ECG and MCG signals in the QRS complex, T-wave and ST-segment, with greater relative differences seen in the 36-lead ECG and MCG as compared to the 12-leads ECG (34% and 37% vs 26%, respectively). The 36-lead ECG showed more averaged sensitivity than the MCG in the change of T-wave due to ischemia (37% vs 32%, respectively), whereas the MCG showed greater sensitivity than the ECG in the change of the ST-segment (50% vs 40%, respectively). In addition, both MCG and ECG showed regional-dependent changes to ischemia, but with MCG showing a stronger correlation between ischemic region in the heart. In conclusion, MCG shows more sensitivity than ECG in response to ischemia, which may provide an alternative method for the diagnosis of ischemia."

Knowledge of golden eagle abundance and distribution across the western USA must be improved to help identify and conserve areas of major importance to the species. We used distance sampling and visual mark-recapture procedures to estimate golden eagle abundance from aerial line-transect surveys conducted across four Bird Conservation Regions in the western USA between 15 August and 15 September in 2006–2010, 2012, and 2013. To assess golden eagle-habitat relationships at this scale, we modeled counts of golden eagles seen during surveys in 2006–2010, adjusted for probability of detection, and used land cover and other environmental factors as predictor variables within 20-km2 sampling units randomly selected from survey transects. We found evidence of positive relationships between intensity of use by golden eagles and elevation, solar radiation, and mean wind speed, and of negative relationships with the proportion of landscape classified as forest or as developed. The model accurately predicted habitat use observed during surveys conducted in 2012 and 2013. We used the model to construct a map predicting intensity of use by golden eagles during late summer across our ~2 million-km2 study area. The map can be used to help prioritize landscapes for conservation efforts, identify areas where mitigation efforts may be most effective, and identify regions for additional research and monitoring. In addition, our map can be used to develop region-specific (e.g., state-level) density estimates based on the latest information on golden eagle abundance from a late-summer survey and aid designation of geographic management units for the species."
https://openalex.org/W2512508484,"Advanced approaches to preparing non-noble-metal electrocatalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) are considered to be a significant breakthrough in promoting the exploration of renewable resources. In this work, a hybrid material of MoS2 nanoflowers (NFs) on reduced graphene oxide (rGO) was synthesized as a HER catalyst via an environmentally friendly, efficient approach that is also suitable for mass production. Small-sized MoS2 NFs with a diameter of ca. 190 nm and an abundance of exposed edges were prepared by a hydrothermal method and were subsequently supported on rGO by microwave-assisted synthesis. The results show that MoS2 NFs were distributed uniformly on the remarkably reduced GO and preserved the outstanding original structural features perfectly. Electrochemical tests show that the as-prepared hybrid material exhibited excellent HER activity, with a small Tafel slope of 80 mV/decade and a low overpotential of 170 mV."
https://openalex.org/W2512873199,"Plant chemistry is an important contributor to the interaction with herbivores. Here, we report on a previously unknown role for foliar and glandular trichome volatiles in their interaction with the specialist herbivore of solanaceous plants, the tomato red spider mite Tetranychus evansi. We used various bioassays and chemical analyses including coupled gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC/MS) and liquid chromatography coupled to quadrupole time of flight mass spectrometry (LC-QToF-MS) to investigate this interaction between cultivated African nightshades and T. evansi. We show that, whereas morphologically different cultivated African nightshade species released similar foliar volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that attracted T. evansi, VOCs released from exudates of ruptured glandular trichomes of one nightshade species influenced local defense on the leaf surface. VOCs from ruptured glandular trichomes comprising mainly saturated and unsaturated fatty acids deterred T. evansi oviposition. Of the fatty acids, the unsaturated fatty acids accounted for >40% of the oviposition deterrent activity. Our findings point to a defense strategy in a plant, based on opposing roles for volatiles released by foliar and glandular trichomes in response to attack by a specialist herbivore."

https://openalex.org/W2516741074,"The Cancer Genetic Markers of Susceptibility genome-wide association study (GWAS) originally identified a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs11249433 at 1p11.2 associated with breast cancer risk. To fine-map this locus, we genotyped 92 SNPs in a 900kb region (120,505,799-121,481,132) flanking rs11249433 in 45,276 breast cancer cases and 48,998 controls of European, Asian and African ancestry from 50 studies in the Breast Cancer Association Consortium. Genotyping was done using iCOGS, a custom-built array. Due to the complicated nature of the region on chr1p11.2: 120,300,000-120,505,798, that lies near the centromere and contains seven duplicated genomic segments, we restricted analyses to 429 SNPs excluding the duplicated regions (42 genotyped and 387 imputed). Per-allelic associations with breast cancer risk were estimated using logistic regression models adjusting for study and ancestry-specific principal components. The strongest association observed was with the original identified index SNP rs11249433 (minor allele frequency (MAF) 0.402; per-allele odds ratio (OR) = 1.10, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.08-1.13, P = 1.49 x 10-21). The association for rs11249433 was limited to ER-positive breast cancers (test for heterogeneity P≤8.41 x 10-5). Additional analyses by other tumor characteristics showed stronger associations with moderately/well differentiated tumors and tumors of lobular histology. Although no significant eQTL associations were observed, in silico analyses showed that rs11249433 was located in a region that is likely a weak enhancer/promoter. Fine-mapping analysis of the 1p11.2 breast cancer susceptibility locus confirms this region to be limited to risk to cancers that are ER-positive."

To improve access to care, CD4 enumeration and viral load tests have been redesigned to be used as point-of-care techniques using finger-stick blood. Accurate CD4 counting in capillary blood requires a free flowing blood drop that is achieved by blade incision. The aim of this study was to assess the attitude of the patients toward blade-based finger-stick blood donation. Methods Four hundred and ninety-nine patients were included (299 patients from South Africa and 200 from Belgium). They completed a questionnaire to express their preference for finger stick or venipuncture, after undergoing both. The South African patient cohort was divided in two groups, receiving either single or multiple finger stick for CD4 and other HIV-related tests. The Belgian patients received a single finger stick for CD4 testing, and were asked to respond directly and again after two days. Results The majority of the patients preferred the finger stick to the venipuncture. The perceived pain using the blade was superior to a small needle, but similar to a large needle. They preferred up to three finger sticks over one venipuncture. Up to 30% of the patients changed their mind over two days. The main reason for choosing a finger stick was continued bleeding after venipuncture. The most cited objection to finger stick was pain/soreness. Conclusion Patient perceptions support the implementation of donating capillary blood with blade-based finger stick during CD4 point-of-care testing."
https://openalex.org/W2513255906,"DNA polymerase (pol) ι is a Y-family polymerase involved in translesion synthesis, exhibiting higher catalytic activity with Mn2+ than Mg2+. The human germline R96G variant impairs both Mn2+-dependent and Mg2+-dependent activities of pol ι, whereas the Δ1–25 variant selectively enhances its Mg2+-dependent activity. We analyzed pre-steady-state kinetic and structural effects of these two metal ions and genetic variations on pol ι using pol ι core (residues 1–445) proteins. The presence of Mn2+ (0.15 mm) instead of Mg2+ (2 mm) caused a 770-fold increase in efficiency (kpol/Kd,dCTP) of pol ι for dCTP insertion opposite G, mainly due to a 450-fold decrease in Kd,dCTP. The R96G and Δ1–25 variants displayed a 53-fold decrease and a 3-fold increase, respectively, in kpol/Kd,dCTP for dCTP insertion opposite G with Mg2+ when compared with wild type, substantially attenuated by substitution with Mn2+. Crystal structures of pol ι ternary complexes, including the primer terminus 3′-OH and a non-hydrolyzable dCTP analogue opposite G with the active-site Mg2+ or Mn2+, revealed that Mn2+ achieves more optimal octahedral coordination geometry than Mg2+, with lower values in average coordination distance geometry in the catalytic metal A-site. Crystal structures of R96G revealed the loss of three H-bonds of residues Gly-96 and Tyr-93 with an incoming dNTP, due to the lack of an arginine, as well as a destabilized Tyr-93 side chain secondary to the loss of a cation-π interaction between both side chains. These results provide a mechanistic basis for alteration in pol ι catalytic function with coordinating metals and genetic variation."
https://openalex.org/W2517583873,"Tropical cyclones are extreme random meteorological events that can have profound implications to coastal biodiversities. Given that the frequency, intensity and duration of these events are poised to increase due to the global climate change, understanding the ecological impacts of such erratic occurrences becomes imperative to devise better management strategies. The eventful passage of the tropical cyclone, Phyan, along the northwestern coast of India in November 2009, coupled with the availability of historical data presented a rare opportunity to elucidate the consequences on the polychaete assemblages of the Malvan Marine Sanctuary and their subsequent recovery. This was achieved by comparison of the pre- and post-Phyan seasonal data from four different sites in and around the Sanctuary. MDS analyses and polychaete community parameters suggested conspicuous cyclone related effects on the polychaete community characteristics in the three outer stations off Malvan, whereas the relatively protected bay station remained more or less unscathed. Impacts, attributable to the cyclone apart from seasonal variations, included changes in polychaete composition, reductions in total polychaete density, species diversity, evenness and functional groups. Dominance of the opportunistic polychaete, Paraprionospiopatiens was all pervasive just after Phyan, resulting in poor diversity and evenness values. In the outer stations, diverse feeding modes present prior to the cyclone were replaced by microphagous feeders post the disturbance. However, the study also observed complete recovery as substantiated by the improvement inpolychaete density, diversity indices and re-instatement of multiple feeding guilds in affected areas. This resilience of the coastal waters off Malvan is attributed to its marine protected status, implying that reduced human interference aided rapid revival of damaged ecosystems."

This study identified that NS5 (VPg), is capable of inducing cell cycle arrest in the absence of viral replication or other viral proteins in an analogous manner to MNV-1 infection. NS5 expression induced an accumulation of cells in the G0/G1 phase in an asynchronous population by inhibiting progression at the G1/S restriction point. Furthermore, NS5 expression resulted in a down-regulation of cyclin A expression in asynchronous cells and inhibited cyclin A expression in cells progressing from G1 to S phase. The activity of NS5 on the host cell cycle occurs through an uncharacterized function. Amino acid substitutions of NS5(Y26A) and NS5(F123A) that inhibit the ability for NS5 to attach to RNA and recruit host eukaryotic translation initiation factors, respectively, retained the ability to induce an accumulation of cells in the G0/G1 phase as identified for wild-type NS5.

A vaccine against canine visceral leishmaniasis (CVL) would be an important tool for decreasing the anxiety related to possible L. chagasi infection and for controlling human visceral leishmaniasis (VL). Because the sand fly salivary proteins are potent immunogens obligatorily co-deposited during transmission of Leishmania parasites, their inclusion in an anti-Leishmania vaccine has been investigated in past decades. We investigated the immunogenicity of the ""LbSapSal"" vaccine (L. braziliensis antigens, saponin as adjuvant, and Lutzomyia longipalpis salivary gland extract) in dogs at baseline (T0), during the post-vaccination protocol (T3rd) and after early (T90) and late (T885) times following L. chagasi-challenge. Our major data indicated that immunization with ""LbSapSal"" is able to induce biomarkers characterized by enhanced amounts of type I (tumor necrosis factor [TNF]-α, interleukin [IL]-12, interferon [IFN]-γ) cytokines and reduction in type II cytokines (IL-4 and TGF-β), even after experimental challenge. The establishment of a prominent pro-inflammatory immune response after ""LbSapSal"" immunization supported the increased levels of nitric oxide production, favoring a reduction in spleen parasitism (78.9%) and indicating long-lasting protection against L. chagasi infection. In conclusion, these results confirmed the hypothesis that the ""LbSapSal"" vaccination is a potential tool to control the Leishmania chagasi infection."

The ability of S. enterica to produce hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is an important phenotypic characteristic used to screen and identify Salmonella with selective medium; however, H2S-negative Salmonella have recently emerged. In this study, the H2S phenotype of Salmonella isolates was confirmed, and the selected isolates were subjected to antimicrobial susceptibility testing and molecular identification by multilocus sequence typing, pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, and clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR) analysis. The phs genetic operon was also analyzed. A total of 160 S. enterica serovar Aberdeen isolates were detected between 2005 and 2013 in China. Of them, seven non-H2S-producing isolates were detected. Notably, four samples yielded four pairs of isolates with different H2S phenotypes, simultaneously. The data demonstrated that H2S-negative isolates were genetically closely related to H2S-positive isolates. Three new spacers (Abe1, Abe2, and Abe3) were identified in CRISPR locus 1 in four pairs of isolates with different H2S phenotypes from the same samples. Sequence analysis revealed a new nonsense mutation at position 208 in the phsA gene of all non-H2S-producing isolates. Additionally, we describe a new screening procedure to avoid H2S-negative Salmonella, which would normally be overlooked during laboratory and hospital screening. The prevalence of this pathogen may be underestimated; therefore, it is important to focus on improving surveillance of this organism to control its spread."

The stream consists of three 1st order headwaters and a 2nd order main stem. The stream network is fringed by peat soils with no riparian trees, though dwarf shrubs provide shading in the lower catchment. Dissolved oxygen (DO) is regulated by the balance between atmospheric re-aeration and the metabolic processes of photosynthesis and respiration. DO was continuously measured for >1 year and the data used to calibrate a mass balance model, to estimate primary production, respiration and re-aeration for a 1st order site and in the 2nd order main stem. Results showed that the stream was always heterotrophic at both sites. Sites were most heterotrophic in the summer reflecting higher levels of stream metabolism. The 1st order stream appeared more heterotrophic which was consistent with the evident greater biomass of macrophytes in the 2nd order stream, with resulting higher primary productivity. Comparison between respiration, primary production, re-aeration and potential physical controls revealed only weak relationships. However, the most basic model parameters (e.g. the parameter linking light and photosynthesis) controlling ecosystem processes resulted in significant differences between the sites which seem related to the stream channel geometry."
https://openalex.org/W2509042913,"The intersection of small molecular weight drugs and antibody-based therapeutics is rarely studied in large scale. Both types of agents are currently part of the cancer armamentarium. However, very little is known about how to combine them in optimal ways. Immunotoxins are antibody-toxin gene fusion proteins engineered to target cancer cells via antibody binding to surface antigens. For fusion proteins derived from Pseudomonas exotoxin (PE), potency relies on the enzymatic domain of the toxin which catalyzes the ADP-ribosylation of EF2 causing inhibition of protein synthesis leading to cell death. Candidate immunotoxins have demonstrated clear value in clinical trials but generally have not been curative as single agents. Therefore we undertook three screens to discover effective combinations that could act synergistically. From the MIPE-3 library of compounds we identified various enhancers of immunotoxin action and at least one major class of inhibitor. Follow-up experiments confirmed the screening data and suggested that immunotoxins when administered with everolimus or nilotinib exhibit favorable combinatory activity and would be candidates for preclinical development. Mechanistic studies revealed that everolimus-immunotoxin combinations acted synergistically on elements of the protein synthetic machinery, including S61 kinase and 4E-BP1 of the mTORC1 pathway. Conversely, PARP inhibitors antagonized immunotoxins and also blocked the toxicity due to native ADP-ribosylating toxins. Thus, our goal of investigating a chemical library was justified based on the identification of several approved compounds that could be developed preclinically as ‘enhancers’ and at least one class of mitigator to be avoided."

The present study used a multi-locus approach (12 segments of mitochondrial and nuclear DNA) to elucidate the levels of genetic diversity and genetic connectivity of L. purpureus populations and their demographic history. L. purpureus has high levels of genetic diversity, which probably implies in high effective population sizes values for the species.

https://openalex.org/W2517659022,"Marine oils are important to human nutrition as the major source of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), a key omega-3 long-chain (≥C20) polyunsaturated fatty acid (n-3 LC-PUFA) that is low or lacking in terrestrial plant or animal oils. The inclusion of fish oil as main source of n-3 LC-PUFA in aquafeeds is mostly limited by the increasing price and decreasing availability. Fish oil replacement with cheaper terrestrial plant and animal oils has considerably reduced the content of n-3 LC-PUFA in flesh of farmed Atlantic salmon. Novel DHA-enriched oils with high alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) content will be available from transgenic oilseeds plants in the near future as an alternative for dietary fish oil replacement in aquafeeds. As a preliminary validation, we formulated an oil blend (TOFX) with high DHA and ALA content using tuna oil (TO) high in DHA and the flaxseed oil (FX) high in ALA, and assessed its ability to achieve fish oil-like n-3 LC-PUFA tissue composition in Atlantic salmon smolts. We applied proteomics as an exploratory approach to understand the effects of nutritional changes on the fish liver. Comparisons were made between fish fed a fish oil-based diet (FO) and a commercial-like oil blend diet (fish oil + poultry oil, FOPO) over 89 days. Growth and feed efficiency ratio were lower on the TOFX diet. Fish muscle concentration of n-3 LC-PUFA was significantly higher for TOFX than for FOPO fish, but not higher than for FO fish, while retention efficiency of n-3 LC-PUFA was promoted by TOFX relative to FO. Proteomics analysis revealed an oxidative stress response indicative of the main adaptive physiological mechanism in TOFX fish. While specific dietary fatty acid concentrations and balances and antioxidant supplementation may need further attention, the use of an oil with a high content of DHA and ALA can enhance tissue deposition of n-3 LC-PUFA in relation to a commercially used oil blend."
https://openalex.org/W2518066842,"Objective The aim of the study was to calculate the effective dose during fluoroscopy-guided pediatric interventional procedures of the liver in a phantom model before and after adjustment of preset parameters. Methods Organ doses were measured in three anthropomorphic Rando-Alderson phantoms representing children at various age and body weight (newborn 3.5kg, toddler 10kg, child 19kg). Collimation was performed focusing on the upper abdomen representing mock interventional radiology procedures such as percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography and drainage placement (PTCD). Fluoroscopy and digital subtraction angiography (DSA) acquisitions were performed in a posterior-anterior geometry using a state of the art flat-panel detector. Effective dose was directly measured from multiple incorporated thermoluminescent dosimeters (TLDs) using two different parameter settings. Results Effective dose values for each pediatric phantom were below 0.1mSv per minute fluoroscopy, and below 1mSv for a 1 minute DSA acquisition with a frame rate of 2 f/s. Lowering the values for the detector entrance dose enabled a reduction of the applied effective dose from 12 to 27% for fluoroscopy and 22 to 63% for DSA acquisitions. Similarly, organ doses of radiosensitive organs could be reduced by over 50%, especially when close to the primary x-ray beam. Conclusion Modification of preset parameter settings enabled to decrease the effective dose for pediatric interventional procedures, as determined by effective dose calculations using dedicated pediatric Rando-Alderson phantoms."
https://openalex.org/W2509506152,"We examined and compared both the methylomes and the modification-related gene content of four sequenced strains of Bibersteinia trehalosi isolated from the nasopharyngeal tracts of Nebraska cattle with symptoms of bovine respiratory disease complex. The methylation patterns and the encoded DNA methyltransferase (MTase) gene sets were different between each strain, with the only common pattern being that of Dam (GATC). Among the observed patterns were three novel motifs attributable to Type I restriction-modification systems. In some cases the differences in methylation patterns corresponded to the gain or loss of MTase genes, or to recombination at target recognition domains that resulted in changes of enzyme specificity. However, in other cases the differences could be attributed to differential expression of the same MTase gene across strains. The most obvious regulatory mechanism responsible for these differences was slipped strand mispairing within short sequence repeat regions. The combined action of these evolutionary forces allows for alteration of different parts of the methylome at different time scales. We hypothesize that pleiotropic transcriptional modulation resulting from the observed methylomic changes may be involved with the switch between the commensal and pathogenic states of this common member of ruminant microflora."

The freehand osteotomy position was compared to potential osteotomy positions using the alignment jig/saw guide. The proximal and distal jig pin holes on postoperative radiographs were used to align the jig to the bone; saw guide position was selected to most closely match the osteotomy performed. The guide-to-osteotomy fit was categorized by the distance between the actual osteotomy and proposed saw guide osteotomy at its greatest offset (≤1 mm = excellent; ≤2 mm = good; ≤3 mm = satisfactory; >3 mm = poor).Sixty-four of 65 TPLO osteotomies could be matched satisfactorily by the saw guide. Proximal jig pin placement 3-4 mm from the joint surface and pin location in a craniocaudal plane on the proximal tibia were significantly associated with the guide-to-osteotomy fit (P = 0.021 and P = 0.047, respectively).The alignment jig/saw guide can be used to reproduce appropriate freehand osteotomy position for TPLO. Furthermore, an ideal osteotomy position centered on the tibial intercondylar tubercles also is possible. Accurate placement of the proximal jig pin is a crucial step for correct positioning of the saw guide in either instance."
https://openalex.org/W2509828011,"To find genetic association between complex diseases and phenotypic traits, one important procedure is conducting a joint analysis. Multifactor dimensionality reduction (MDR) is an efficient method of examining the interactions between genes in genetic association studies. It commonly assumes a dichotomous classification of the binary phenotypes. Its usual approach to determining the genomic association is to construct a confusion matrix to estimate a classification error, where a binary risk status is determined and assigned to each genotypic multifactor class. While multi-class phenotypes are commonly observed, the current MDR approach does not handle these phenotypes appropriately because the thresholds for the risk statuses may not be clear. In this study, we suggest a new method for estimating gene-gene interactions for multi-class phenotypes. Our approach adopts the index of dissimilarity (IDS) as an evaluation measure. This is analytically equivalent to the common association measure of balanced accuracy (BA) for the binary traits, while it is not required to determine the risk status for the estimation. Moreover, it is easily expandable to the generalized index of dissimilarity (GIDS), which has an explicit form that can handle any number of categories. The performance of the proposed method was compared with those of other approaches via simulation studies in which fifteen genetic models were generated with three class outcomes. A consistently better performance was observed using the proposed method. The effect of a varying number of categories was examined. The proposed method was also illustrated using real genome-wide association studies (GWAS) data from the Korean Association Resource (KARE) project."
https://openalex.org/W2514601824,"Late toxicity after concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT), such as dysphagia, in patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck has received a good deal of attention recently. The gastrostomy tube (G-tube) dependence rate 1 year after CCRT was reported to be 16.7-42.9% in Western countries. We evaluated swallowing outcomes after CCRT in patients with hypopharyngeal cancer (HPC) treated in our hospital and compared them with previous reports.We reviewed 96 consecutive patients with a HPC treated by radiotherapy with intravenous or intra-arterial chemotherapy between 2006 and 2013 at Hokkaido University Hospital, Sapporo, Japan.At 1 month after CCRT, 13 patients (13.7%) used a G-tube, whereas 5/91 (5.5%) and 4/81 (4.9%) used a G-tube at 3 and 6 months, respectively. Two patients used a G-tube at 12 and 24 months after CCRT (G-tube use rate: 2.8% at 12 months, and 3.2% at 24 months). The variables female, posterior wall primary, stage IV, ECOG performance status of 2, and smoking status were significantly associated with G-tube use at 12 months after CCRT, whereas the route of cisplatin administration was not related to G-tube use (p = 0.303).The G-tube use rate up to 1year could be lower in Japanese patients than in Western patients according to previous reports. In particular, Japanese patients resume oral intake sooner than Western patients. Further study of the incidence of dysphagia after CCRT by ethnicity is required to clarify the differences in dysphagia after CCRT."
https://openalex.org/W2297243531,"Geometric phases describe how in a continuous-time dynamical system the displacement of a variable (called phase variable) can be related to other variables (shape variables) undergoing a cyclic motion, according to an area rule. The aim of this paper is to show that geometric phases can exist also for discrete-time systems, and even when the cycles in shape space have zero area. A context in which this principle can be applied is stock trading. A zero-area cycle in shape space represents the type of trading operations normally carried out by high-frequency traders (entering and exiting a position on a fast time-scale), while the phase variable represents the cash balance of a trader. Under the assumption that trading impacts stock prices, even zero-area cyclic trading operations can induce geometric phases, i.e., profits or losses, without affecting the stock quote."
https://openalex.org/W2509244362,"We have previously reported that human dermal bone morphogenic protein receptor (BMPR) IB positive subpopulation had a high osteogenic differentiation potential and may be a promising cell source for allogeneic bone tissue engineering. In this study, the immunologic properties of dermal BMPR-IB+ subpopulation before and after osteogenic differentiation were reported. The results confirmed that dermal BMPR-IB+ cells possessed a similar osteogenic differentiation potential with bone marrow mesenchymal stromal cells in a mouse model. Furthermore, the expression of immune rejection-related surface antigens such as major histocompatibility class II and co-stimulatory proteins (CD40, CD80, and CD86) were absent on dermal BMPRIB+ cells. Dermal BMPRIB+ cells elicited no proliferation of allogeneic splenocytes and suppressed the proliferation of stimulated immune cells. Interestingly, osteogenic differentiation in vitro had no adverse effect on the immunological features of these cells. Most importantly, inducible NO synthase (iNOS) was involved in immunoregulatory effects by undifferentiated BMPRIB+ fibroblasts, whereas indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) activity was related to mediating immunomodulatory function by osteogenic differentiated BMPRIB+ fibroblasts. In conclusion, dermal BMPRIB+ cells have a low immunogenicity and possess immunosuppressive capacity before and after osteogenic differentiation in vitro, which would facilitate the allotransplantation in the future. However, mechanisms mediating immunoregulatory property between undifferentiated and osteogenic differentiated BMPRIB+ fibroblasts may be different and need further investigation."
https://openalex.org/W2515161019,"This study evaluates the diagnostic accuracy of [F-18]-fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography/computed tomography (FDG-PET/CT) of the chest/upper abdomen compared to the generally performed scan from head to upper thighs, for staging and management of (suspected) lung cancer in patients with no history of malignancy or complaints outside the thorax.FDG-PET/CT scans of 1059 patients with suspected or recently proven lung cancer, with no history of malignancy or complaints outside the thorax, were analysed in a retrospective multi-centre trial. Suspect FDG-avid lesions in the chest and upper abdomen, the head and neck area above the shoulder line and in the abdomen and pelvis below the caudal tip of the liver were noted. The impact of lesions detected in the head and neck area and abdomen and pelvis on additional diagnostic procedures, staging and treatment decisions was evaluated.The head and neck area revealed additional suspect lesions in 7.2%, and the abdomen and pelvis in 15.8% of patients. Imaging of the head and neck area and the abdomen and pelvic area showed additional lesions in 19.5%, inducing additional diagnostic procedures in 7.8%. This resulted in discovery of additional lesions considered malignant in 10.7%, changing patient management for lung cancer in 1.2%. In (suspected) lung cancer, PET/CT limited to the chest and upper abdomen resulted in correct staging in 98.7% of patients, which led to the identical management as full field of view PET in 98.8% of patients.High value of FDG-PET/CT for staging and correct patient management is already achieved with chest and upper abdomen. Findings in head and neck area and abdomen and pelvis generally induce investigations with limited or no impact on staging and treatment of NSCLC, and can be interpreted accordingly."
