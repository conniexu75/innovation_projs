https://openalex.org/W4295909379,"Urinary tract infection (UTI) accounts for a significant morbidity and mortality across the world and is a leading cause for antibiotic prescriptions in the community especially in developing countries. Empirical choice of antibiotics for treatment of UTI is often discordant with the drug susceptibility of the etiologic agent. This study aimed to estimate the prevalence of community-acquired UTI caused by antibiotic resistant organisms. This was a cross-sectional study where urine samples were prospectively collected from 4,500 patients at the icddr,b diagnostic clinic in Dhaka, Bangladesh during 2016–2018. Urine samples were analyzed by standard culture method and the isolated bacteria were tested for antibiotic susceptibility by using disc diffusion method and VITEK-2. Descriptive statistics were used to estimate the prevalence of community acquired UTI (CA-UTI) by different age groups, sex, and etiology of infection. Relationship between the etiology of CA-UTI and age and sex of patients was analyzed using binary logistic regression analysis. Seasonal trends in the prevalence of CA-UTI, multi-drug resistant (MDR) pathogens and MDR Escherichia coli were also analyzed. Around 81% of patients were adults (≥18y). Of 3,200 (71%) urine samples with bacterial growth, 920 (29%) had a bacterial count of ≥1.0x10 5 CFU/ml indicating UTI. Women were more likely to have UTI compared to males (OR: 1.48, CI: 1.24–1.76). E . coli (51.6%) was the predominant causative pathogen followed by Streptococcus spp. (15.7%), Klebsiella spp. (12.1%), Enterococcus spp. (6.4%), Pseudomonas spp. (4.4%), coagulase-negative Staphylococcus spp. (2.0%), and other pathogens (7.8%). Both E . coli and Klebsiella spp. were predominantly resistant to penicillin (85%, 95%, respectively) followed by macrolide (70%, 76%), third-generation cephalosporins (69%, 58%), fluoroquinolones (69%, 53%) and carbapenem (5%, 9%). Around 65% of patients tested positive for multi-drug resistant (MDR) uropathogens. A higher number of male patients tested positive for MDR pathogens compared to the female patients ( p = 0.015). Overall, 71% of Gram-negative and 46% of Gram-positive bacteria were MDR. The burden of community-acquired UTI caused by MDR organisms was high among the study population. The findings of the study will guide clinicians to be more selective about their antibiotic choice for empirical treatment of UTI and alleviate misuse/overuse of antibiotics in the community."

The Elecsys® Anti-SARS-CoV-2 S (Elecsys® anti-S) was developed to measure anti-SARS-CoV-2 S proteins. We sought to investigate whether Elecsys® anti-S can be used to predict neutralizing activities in patients’ serums using an authentic virus neutralization assay. One hundred forty-six serum samples were obtained from 59 patients with COVID-19 at multiple time points. Of the 59 patients, 44 cases were included in Group M (mild 23, moderate 21) and produced 84 samples (mild 35, moderate 49), while 15 cases were included in Group S (severe 11, critical 4) and produced 62 samples (severe 43, critical 19). The neutralization assay detected 73% positive cases, and Elecsys® anti-S and Elecsys® Anti-SARS-CoV-2 (Elecsys® anti-N) showed 72% and 66% positive cases, respectively. A linear correlation between the Elecsys® anti-S assay and the neutralization assay were highly correlated ( r = 0.7253, r 2 = 0.5261) than a linear correlation between the Elecsys® anti-N and neutralization assay ( r = 0.5824, r 2 = 0.3392). The levels of Elecsys® anti-S antibody and neutralizing activities were significantly higher in Group S than in Group M after 6 weeks from onset of symptoms ( p &lt; 0.05). Conversely, the levels of Elecsys® anti-N were comparable in both groups. Three immunosuppressed patients, including cancer patients, showed low levels of anti-S and anti-N antibodies and neutralizing activities throughout the measurement period, indicating the need for careful follow-up. Our data indicate that Elecsys® anti-S can predict the neutralization antibodies in COVID-19."
https://openalex.org/W4295903197,"In human cells homologous recombination (HR) is critical for repair of DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) and rescue of stalled or collapsed replication forks. HR is facilitated by RAD51 which is loaded onto DNA by either BRCA2-BRCA1-PALB2 or RAD52. In human culture cells, double-knockdowns of RAD52 and genes in the BRCA1-BRCA2-PALB2 axis are lethal. Mutations in BRCA2, BRCA1 or PALB2 significantly impairs error free HR as RAD51 loading relies on RAD52 which is not as proficient as BRCA2-BRCA1-PALB2. RAD52 also facilitates Single Strand Annealing (SSA) that produces intra-chromosomal deletions. Some RAD52 mutations that affect the SSA function or decrease RAD52 association with DNA can suppress certain BRCA2 associated phenotypes in breast cancers. In this report we did a pan-cancer analysis using data reported on the Catalogue of Somatic Mutations in Cancers (COSMIC) to identify double mutants between RAD52 and BRCA1, BRCA2 or PALB2 that occur in cancer cells. We find that co-occurring mutations are likely in certain cancer tissues but not others. However, all mutations occur in a heterozygous state. Further, using computational and machine learning tools we identified only a handful of pathogenic or driver mutations predicted to significantly affect the function of the proteins. This supports previous findings that co-inactivation of RAD52 with any members of the BRCA2-BRCA1-PALB2 axis is lethal. Molecular modeling also revealed that pathogenic RAD52 mutations co-occurring with mutations in BRCA2-BRCA1-PALB2 axis are either expected to attenuate its SSA function or its interaction with DNA. This study extends previous breast cancer findings to other cancer types and shows that co-occurring mutations likely destabilize HR by similar mechanisms as in breast cancers."
https://openalex.org/W4295904909,"Ethiopia has set national targets for eliminating soil-transmitted helminths (STH) as public health problems by 2020 and for breaking their transmission by 2025 using periodic mass treatment of children in endemic areas. However, the status of STH infection among the adults living in the same communities remains unknown. The aim of this study, therefore, was to determine the prevalence and intensity of STH infections and associated factors among the household heads in the peri-urban areas of Jimma town, Oromia, Ethiopia.A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted in five peri-urban kebeles (smallest administrative unit in Ethiopia) of Jimma town from May to July 2021. A semi-structured questionnaire was used to collect data on socio-demographic and predisposing factors. The Kato-Katz concentration technique was utilized to detect and quantify the STH in stool samples. Both bivariate and multivariate analyses were done. P-value <0.05 was considered statistically significant.A total of 376 household heads (19.9% women and 80.1% men) from peri-urban areas were included in the study. The overall STH prevalence was 18.1% (95% CI: 14.6-22.1) with A. lumbricoides being the predominant species (11.4%) followed by T. trichiura (7.2%) and hookworm (2.1%). Most of the STH positive household heads had single infections (85.3%) and light-intensity infections (88.5%). Wealth status (AOR = 2.7; 95% CI: 1.31-5.50, P = 0.007), hand washing habits before meals (AOR = 7.07; 95% CI: 1.79-27.88, p = 0.005), fingernails status (AOR = 2.99; 95% CI: 1.59-5.65, p = 0.001), and toilet facility type (AOR = 2.06; 95% CI: 1.13-3.76, p = 0.017) were found to have statistically significant associations with the STH infection.The findings of this study showed a nearly moderate level of STH prevalence among household heads in the peri-urban community. This could serve as an important reservoir for reinfection of the treated children and other at-risk groups in the community."
https://openalex.org/W4295905192,"Measuring cultural competence has been difficult for conceptual and practical reasons. Yet, professional guidelines and stated values call for training to improve cultural competence. To develop a strong evidence-base for training and improving cultural competence, professionals need reliable and valid measures to capture meaningful changes in cultural competence training. We developed a measure for cultural competence that could be used in a general population to measure changes in awareness, knowledge, and skills in interacting with culturally diverse others. We built an 81-item scale with items conceptually categorized into awareness, knowledge, and skills and was presented to an expert panel for feedback. For evaluation, a national panel of 204 adults responded to the new scale and other measures associated with cultural competence. Factor analysis revealed four factors with strong reliabilities: Awareness of Self, Awareness of Others, Proactive Skills Development, and Knowledge ( a s = .87 - .92). The final overall scale, Awareness, Knowledge, Skills—General (ASK-G) had 37 items and strong reliability ( a = .94). The ASK-G was then compared to validated scales to provide evidence of concurrent, convergent, and divergent validity. Strong evidence emerged for these. The ASK-G is a promising tool to measure cultural competence in a general population."
https://openalex.org/W4295898639,"Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), represents an unmet medical need that can progress to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), which, without intervention, can result in the development of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Inflammation is a pathological hallmark of NASH, and targeting key inflammatory mediators of NASH may lead to potential therapeutics for the disease. Herein, we aimed to investigate the role of IL-23 signaling in NASH progression in murine models. We showed that recombinant IL-23 can promote IL-17 producing cell expansion in the liver and that these cells are predominately γδ T cells and Mucosal Associated Invariant T cells (MAITs). Reciprocally, we found that IL-23 signaling is necessary for the expansion of γδ T cells and MAIT cells in the western diet (WD) diet induced NASH model. However, we did not observe any significant differences in liver inflammation and fibrosis between wild type and Il23r-/- mice in the same NASH model. Furthermore, we found that Il23r deletion does not impact liver inflammation and fibrosis in the choline-deficient, L-amino acid-defined and high-fat diet (CDA-HFD) induced NASH model. Based on these findings, we therefore propose that IL-23 signaling is not necessary for NASH pathogenesis in preclinical models and targeting this pathway alone may not be an effective therapeutic approach to ameliorate the disease progression in NASH patients."
https://openalex.org/W4295899235,"Collective user behavior in social media applications often drives several important online and offline phenomena linked to the spread of opinions and information. Several studies have focused on the analysis of such phenomena using networks to model user interactions, represented by edges. However, only a fraction of edges contribute to the actual investigation. Even worse, the often large number of non-relevant edges may obfuscate the salient interactions, blurring the underlying structures and user communities that capture the collective behavior patterns driving the target phenomenon. To solve this issue, researchers have proposed several network backbone extraction techniques to obtain a reduced and representative version of the network that better explains the phenomenon of interest. Each technique has its specific assumptions and procedure to extract the backbone. However, the literature lacks a clear methodology to highlight such assumptions, discuss how they affect the choice of a method and offer validation strategies in scenarios where no ground truth exists. In this work, we fill this gap by proposing a principled methodology for comparing and selecting the most appropriate backbone extraction method given a phenomenon of interest. We characterize ten state-of-the-art techniques in terms of their assumptions, requirements, and other aspects that one must consider to apply them in practice. We present four steps to apply, evaluate and select the best method(s) to a given target phenomenon. We validate our approach using two case studies with different requirements: online discussions on Instagram and coordinated behavior in WhatsApp groups. We show that each method can produce very different backbones, underlying that the choice of an adequate method is of utmost importance to reveal valuable knowledge about the particular phenomenon under investigation."
https://openalex.org/W4295899572,"Introduction The study predicted practice location of doctors trained at a socially accountable medical school with education programs in over 90 communities. Methods A cross-sectional study examined practice location 10 years after the first class graduated from the Northern Ontario School of Medicine (NOSM), Canada. Exact tests and logistic regression models were used to assess practice location in northern Ontario; northern Canada; or other region; and rural (population &lt;10,000) or urban community. Results There were 435 doctors with 334 (77%) practising as family doctors (FPs), 62 (14%) as generalist specialists and 39 (9%) as other medical or surgical specialists. Approximately 92% (128/139) of FPs who completed both UG and PG at NOSM practised in northern Ontario in 2019, compared with 63% (43/68) who completed only their PG at NOSM, and 24% (30/127) who completed only their UG at NOSM. Overall, 37% (23/62) of generalist specialists and 23% (9/39) of other specialists practised in northern Ontario. Approximately 28% (93/334) of FPs practised in rural Canada compared with 4% (4/101) of all other specialists. FP northern Ontario practice was predicted by completing UG and PG at NOSM (adjusted odds ratio = 46, 95% confidence interval = 20–103) or completing only PG at NOSM (15, 6.0–38) relative to completing only UG at NOSM, and having a northern Ontario hometown (5.3, 2.3–12). Rural Canada practice was predicted by rural hometown (2.3, 1.3–3.8), completing only a NOSM PG (2.0, 1.0–3.9), and age (1.4, 1.1–1.8). Conclusion This study uniquely demonstrated the interaction of two mechanisms by which medical schools can increase the proportion of doctors’ practices located in economically deprived regions: first, admit medical students who grow up in the region; and second, provide immersive UG and PG medical education in the region. Both mechanisms have enabled the majority of NOSM-trained doctors to practise in the underserved region of northern Ontario."
https://openalex.org/W4295900181,"While the evidence is clear that 2020 voters shifted away from Election Day voting in favor of vote-by-mail and early voting, we know very little about how health risk versus party polarization around risk assessment influenced how and when to vote. We rely on individual-level observational data in the form of high-quality official voter administrative records from the State of New Mexico to ask how pandemic-related risk factors, especially voter age along with partisanship influenced voter decision-making. To identify causal factors, we use a difference-in-differences design and hazard model that compare 2020 general election and primary voter behavior to 2018 and 2016. We find that age and party were large factors in vote mode decisions in 2020, but not in 2016 or 2018. We consider the implications of our findings on how health risk and partisanship interact to influence decision-making."
https://openalex.org/W4295898234,"Depression is a prominent cause of mental disability globally, having a severe impact on mental and physical health. Depression rehabilitation and treatment, whether through psychiatric management or counseling therapy, is hampered by stigmatizing attitudes regarding psychiatric illness patients impacted by societal and cultural factors. However, little is known about the stigma toward people with depression among the students in Syria.A total of 1,056 students in Syria completed a questionnaire that included a case narrative illustrating depression. A total of 1,056 students in Syria completed a questionnaire that included a case narrative illustrating depression. The survey looked at attitudes toward depression, the desire to keep a safe distance from depressed people, stigma attitudes toward people with depression among college students, perceived beliefs about depressive people, gender (male and female), and the major section (medical and medical and non-medical) differences.Four questionnaires have refused to finish the survey, out of 1259 issued. Around 47.80% of respondents, most of whom were females, felt that sad people might snap out of it. 14.60 percent believe depression isn't even an actual medical condition. Surprisingly, 2% of respondents with a medical background thought the same thing. Regarding more extreme stigmatization, 16.80% of respondents thought depressed persons were harmful. People with depression will be avoided by 19.50 percent of respondents, and people with medical backgrounds will be avoided by 5.20 percent of respondents. Nearly one-fifth of those polled said they would not tell anyone if they were depressed. Only a tiny percentage of respondents (6.90 percent) said they would not hire or vote for a politician who suffers from depression (8.40 percent).According to the study, Syrian college students had a significant level of stigma and social distance toward mentally ill patients. Female students and non-medical students had a higher stigma in most subscale items for people with depression."
https://openalex.org/W4295899840,"Local independence is a principal assumption of applying latent variable models. Violations of this assumption might be stemmed from dimensionality (trait dependence) and statistical independence of item responses (response dependence). The purpose of this study is to evaluate the sensitivity of weighted least squares means and variance adjusted (WLSMV) based global fit indices to violations of local independence in Rasch models, and compare those indices to principal component analysis of residuals (PCAR) that is widely used for Rasch models. Dichotomous Rasch model is considered in this simulation study. The results show that WLSMV-based fit indices could detect trait dependence, but are to be limited with regard to response dependence. Additionally, WLSMV-based fit indices have advantages over the use of PCAR since WLSMV-based global fit indices are consistent regardless of sample size and test length. Though it is not recommended to apply exact benchmarks for those indices, they would provide practitioners with a method for evaluating the degree to which assumption violation is problematic for their data diagnostic purpose."
https://openalex.org/W4295901496,"Mechanistic/data-driven hybrid modeling is a key approach when the mechanistic details of the processes at hand are not sufficiently well understood, but also inferring a model purely from data is too complex. By the integration of first principles into a data-driven approach, hybrid modeling promises a feasible data demand alongside extrapolation. In this work, we introduce a learning strategy for tree-structured hybrid models to perform a binary classification task. Given a set of binary labeled data, the challenge is to use them to develop a model that accurately assesses labels of new unlabeled data. Our strategy employs graph-theoretic methods to analyze the data and deduce a function that maps input features to output labels. Our focus here is on data sets represented by binary features in which the label assessment of unlabeled data points is always extrapolation. Our strategy shows the existence of small sets of data points within given binary data for which knowing the labels allows for extrapolation to the entire valid input space. An implementation of our strategy yields a notable reduction of training-data demand in a binary classification task compared with different supervised machine learning algorithms. As an application, we have fitted a tree-structured hybrid model to the vital status of a cohort of COVID-19 patients requiring intensive-care unit treatment and mechanical ventilation. Our learning strategy yields the existence of patient cohorts for whom knowing the vital status enables extrapolation to the entire valid input space of the developed hybrid model."
https://openalex.org/W4295906623,"Between 2015 and 2020 the Alleviating Specific Phobias Experienced by Children Trial (ASPECT) was conducted in the UK to examine the non-inferiority of One-Session Treatment in comparison to Cognitive Behavioural Therapy based interventions for children and young people with specific phobias. A nested qualitative evaluation was conducted as part of this trial to examine the acceptability of One-Session Treatment. Qualitative interviews were conducted with children and young people taking part in the trial, their parents/guardians, and clinicians delivering the intervention, about their experiences and the acceptability of One Session Treatment. Interviews were digitally recorded and transcribed verbatim. Analysis followed a qualitative framework approach, a widely used method of analysing primary qualitative data pertaining to healthcare practices with policy relevance. Stakeholder groups found One Session Treatment to be an acceptable intervention and barriers and facilitators for its implementation into services were also identified. Potential barriers included challenges to patient flow and treatment scepticism, whilst facilitators included adopting a child-centred approach, child readiness and suitability, opportunity for increased momentum, parental support and involvement, and proximal and distal gains. For One Session Treatment's successful implementation into services, consideration of these barriers is needed and suitability guidance for its use in this population should be developed. Further research exploring children and young people's experiences of receiving Cognitive Behavioural Therapy and its acceptability in comparison to One Session Treatment would be welcomed."
https://openalex.org/W4295907778,"The increasing trend of drugs and substances abuse (DSA) by different age groups and gender in parts of Kenya is not only a socio-economic problem but a public health concern. There is a need to determine prevalence, types and patterns of DSA by age and gender in order to develop all-inclusive and long-term strategies to prevent and manage the DSA within different communities. In this study we determined the prevalence of DSA, types and patterns of drugs and substances being abused and risk factors associated with this abuse.A descriptive cross-sectional mixed methods study was conducted in four counties; Isiolo, Kajiado, Murang'a and Nyamira, all purposively selected from the 47 counties of Kenya based on the review reports of the Kenya Medical Research Institute's County Cluster Coordinators which indicated that DSA was a priority health concern in the selected counties. From each county, two sub-locations each from two locations in one sub-county were purposively selected. In each sub-location, 225 households were systematically selected. Hence, a total of 3,600 participants were systematically sampled for quantitative data collection using an interviewer-based questionnaire to gather information on magnitude and causes of DSA. Additionally, in each county, qualitative data through in-depth interviews (IDIs) with 16 opinion leaders, 16 healthcare personnel, 16 previous DSAs, at least 5 county personnel, 32 current DSAs; and through 16 focus group discussions (FGDs) were concurrently collected to elicit more information on types, patterns and causes of DSA. The observed overall prevalence of DSA was calculated using binomial logistic regression model and factors associated with DSA analyzed using multilevel logistic regression model. Qualitative data was analyzed using QSR NVIVO version 10, thematically by types, patterns and causes of DSA by age and gender.Prevalence of DSA was 86.0% (95%CI: 84.9-87.2) with the highest prevalence being observed in Nyamira County, 89.8% (95%CI: 87.9-91.7). Age-wise, the highest prevalence was observed in persons aged between 45 to 53 years, 89.4% (95%CI: 86.9-92.0), followed by those aged 36 to 44 years, 88.0% (95%CI: 85.4-90.6). Majority of those who abuse drugs and substances were males; 94.5% (95%CI: 93.6-95.4). The most abused drugs or substances were packaged/legal alcohol at 25.2% (745), cigarettes 20.3% (600), local brew (chang'aa) 16.3% (482), and khat (miraa) 10.5% (311). Risk factors analysis revealed that DSA was significantly higher among males (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) = 7.02 (95%CI: 5.21-9.45), p<0.001), government employees (aOR = 2.27 (95%CI: 1.05-4.91), p = 0.036) and unmarried (aOR = 1.71 (95%CI: 1.06-2.77), p = 0.028).These study findings are useful in informing development of specific control programmes which will address age, gender and county needs of DSA in Kenya in order to comprehensively respond to this public health problem. This study was conducted in line with the Kenya National Authority for the Campaign against Alcohol and Drug Abuse (NACADA) mandate to promote use of research on drugs and substances abuse."
https://openalex.org/W4295909060,"Glucocorticoids, such as dexamethasone (Dex), are used to prevent common side effects induced by chemotherapy and are heavily prescribed for solid cancers such as breast cancer. There is substantial pre-clinical data to support that Dex activation of the glucocorticoid receptor overrides chemotherapy-induced apoptosis in breast cancer cell lines. These findings are compounded by a recent study demonstrating that increased glucocorticoid receptor activation by endogenous stress hormones increased breast cancer heterogeneity and metastasis. Our study is the first to use both in vitro and in vivo models to thoroughly compare the Dex response on the migration of multiple estrogen receptor negative (ER-) and ER+ cancer cell lines. ER+ and ER- breast cancer cell lines were studied to compare their endogenous glucocorticoid activity as well as their metastatic ability in response to Dex treatment. We show that in the ER- breast cancer lines, Dex increases cell numbers, invasiveness, and migration, while decreasing apoptotic ability. Furthermore, we show that following Dex treatment, ER- breast cancer lines migrate further in an in vivo zebrafish model in comparison to ER+ cell lines. The use of ROR1 antibody to block WNT signaling diminished the metastatic properties of ER- cells, however recombinant WNT5A alone was not sufficient to induce migration. Taken together, we demonstrate that Dex treatment exacerbates the metastatic potential of ER- but not ER+ cells. These findings add to the growing body of data stressing the potential adverse role of endogenous and synthetic glucocorticoids in breast cancer biology."
https://openalex.org/W4295898557,"A growing number of Type-1 Diabetes (T1D) patients globally use insulin pump technologies to monitor and manage their glucose levels. Although recent advances in closed-loop systems promise automated pump control in the near future, most patients worldwide still use open-loop continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) devices which require close monitoring and continuous regulation. Apart from specialized diabetes units, hospital physicians and nurses generally lack necessary training to support the growing number of patients on insulin pumps. Most hospital staff and providers worldwide have never seen or operated an insulin pump device. T1D patients at nurseries, schools, in hospital emergency rooms, surgery theatres, and in-patient units all require close monitoring and active management. The lack of knowledge and necessary training to support T1D patients on pumps puts them at life-threatening risks. In this work, we develop a training simulation software for hospitals to educate and train their physicians and nurses on how to effectively operate a T1D pump and reduce hypoglycemia events. The software includes clinically validated T1D virtual patients that users can monitor and adjust their pump settings to improve glycemic outcomes. We develop a Fuzzy-Logic learning algorithm that helps guide users learn how to improve pump parameters for these patients. We recruited and trained 13 nurses on the software and report their improvement in pump administration, basal rates adjustments, and ICR modulation."
https://openalex.org/W4295898561,"The Antarctic minke whale (Balaenoptera bonaerensis) (AMW) is one of the smallest species among baleen whales, occurring in the southern hemisphere from Antarctica to near the equator, and performing seasonal migrations from polar to tropical waters. Information about (AMW) occurrence in the winter breeding grounds is scarce, mostly coming from old records from whaling stations before the 1960's international moratorium, such as Costinha Station in Northeastern Brazil (6° S / 34° W) and some sightings from few dedicated visual surveys. Acoustic methods can provide important data on the occurrence and distribution of migratory species. This work describes the occurrence of the Antarctic minke whale through acoustic detections of their ""Bioduck"" vocalisations in the Santos Basin, South-Southeastern Brazil (22° and 28° S / 42° and 48° W). Data was recorded between November 12 and December 19, 2015. AMW calls were detected for 12 days. We detected and classified 9 different Bio-duck calls in Brazilian coastal waters, evidencing a highly diverse acoustic behavior for the minke whale breeding ground. This is the first attempt to describe the acoustic diversity of AMW vocalizations in lower latitudes, contributing important information for future conservation efforts and management of AMW populations and their habitat. Therefore, our study presents the foremost acoustic evidence of the Antarctic minke whale in Brazilian coastal waters."
https://openalex.org/W4295900091,"Hot springs are a major tourism resource in nature-based tourism, and the hot springs market is one of the biggest sectors in wellness tourism markets. In the present study, we examine factors contributing to tourism demand for major hot spring resorts in Japan using ordinary least squares regression models and generalized linear mixed models, and compare the estimation results. The results show that significant factors in most of our models are quality of accommodations and the degree of dependence on inbound demand. Furthermore, the number of non-Japanese languages supported on websites of hot spring resorts has a significant impact on inbound demand. Since the results of the present study cover more than 80 hot spring sites, the results highlight common important factors for hot spring resorts. Such widely applicable factors have been missing in previous studies, and the present study fills this research gap."
https://openalex.org/W4295900307,"Background Mobile health applications (apps) are increasing in interest to enhance patient self-management. Few apps are actually used by patients and have been developed for patients with inflammatory arthritis (IA) treated with disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs which use entails risk of adverse effects such as infections. Objective To develop Hiboot, a self-management mobile app for patients with IA, by using a user-centred step-by-step approach and assess its real-life use. Methods The app development included first a qualitative study with semi-guided audiotaped interviews of 21 patients to identify the impact of IA on daily life and patient treatments practices and an online cross-sectional survey of 344 patients to assess their health apps use in general and potential user needs. A multidisciplinary team developed the first version of the app via five face-to-face meetings. After app launch, a second qualitative study of 21 patients and a users’ test of 13 patients and 3 rheumatologists led to the app’s current version. The number of app installations, current users and comments were collected from the Google Play store and the Apple store. Results The qualitative study revealed needs for counselling, patient–health professional partnership, and skills to cope with risk situations; 86.8% participants would be ready to use an app primarily on their rheumatologist’s recommendation. Six functionalities were implemented: a safety checklist before treatment administration, aids in daily life situations based on the French academic recommendations, treatment reminders, global well-being self-assessment, periodic counselling messages, and a diary. The Hiboot app was installed 20,500 times from September 2017 to October 2020, with 4300 regular current users. Scores were 4.4/5 stars at Android and iOS stores. Conclusion Hiboot is a free self-management app for patients with IA developed by a step-by-step process including patients and health professionals. Further evaluation of the Hiboot benefit is needed."
https://openalex.org/W4295901326,"Evidence from the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic in the U.S. indicated that the virus had vastly different effects across races, with black Americans faring worse on dimensions including illness, hospitalization and death. New data suggests that our understanding of the pandemic’s racial inequities must be revised given the closing of the gap between black and white COVID-related mortality. Initial explanations for inequality in COVID-related outcomes concentrated on static factors—e.g., geography, urbanicity, segregation or age-structures—that are insufficient on their own to explain observed time-varying patterns in inequality. Drawing from a literature suggesting the relevance of political factors in explaining pandemic outcomes, we highlight the importance of political polarization—the partisan divide in pandemic-related policies and beliefs—that varies over time and across geographic units. Specifically, we investigate the role of polarization through two political factors, public opinion and state-level public health policies, using fine-grained data on disparities in public concern over COVID and in state containment/health policies to understand the changing pattern of inequality in mortality. We show that (1) apparent decreases in inequality are driven by increasing total deaths—mostly among white Americans—rather than decreasing mortality among black Americans (2) containment policies are associated with decreasing inequality, likely resulting from lower relative mortality among Blacks (3) as the partisan disparity in Americans who were “unconcerned” about COVID increased, racial inequality in COVID mortality decreased, generating the appearance of greater equality consistent with a “race to the bottom’’ explanation as overall deaths increased and substantively swamping the effects of containment policies."

Nigeria has the highest absolute numbers of child deaths worldwide. Appropriate care-seeking is important for prompt diagnosis, appropriate and timely treatment, and prevention of complications. The objective of this cross-sectional study was to examine the prevalence of and factors associated with appropriate care-seeking for childhood illnesses. Methods We used the most recent Nigeria Demographic and Health Survey (2018) to assess the prevalence of appropriate care-seeking among mothers of children under five with symptoms of common childhood illnesses. For diarrhoea, we defined appropriate care-seeking as seeking care from a formal health provider. For fever and acute respiratory infection (ARI), appropriate care-seeking was defined as seeking care from a formal provider the day of or after symptom onset. Multivariate logistic regression was carried out to assess factors associated with optimal care-seeking for each illness. Results At least 25% of parents did not seek any care for children with fever or ARI; this figure was over one third for diarrhoea. Only 15% and 13% of caregivers showed appropriate care-seeking for their children with fever and ARI respectively, and 27% of mothers sought care from a formal provider for diarrhoea. Predictors of appropriate care-seeking varied according to childhood illness. Previous facility delivery was the only risk factor associated with increased odds of appropriate care-seeking for all three illnesses; other risk factors varied between illnesses. Conclusion Overall, care-seeking for childhood illnesses was suboptimal among caregivers in Nigeria. Interventions to increase caregivers’ awareness of the importance of appropriate care-seeking are needed alongside quality of care interventions that reinforce people’s trust in formal health facilities, to improve timely care-seeking and ultimately reduce the high burden of child deaths in Nigeria."
https://openalex.org/W4295904602,"Keeping in mind the importance of measuring early executive function (EF) skills in low and middle-income countries, the present study examined the feasibility and preliminary psychometric properties of a performance-based computerized EF measure; EF Touch, to be used with Pakistani preschoolers. Review of the content and Urdu translation of verbal instruction EF Touch battery was carried out by subject matter experts before data collection from the 120 preschoolers aged between 3.1 to 5.9 years. The feasibility report indicated that between 79.2% -100% of the preschoolers completed each executive function task. Confirmatory factor analysis revealed the unidimensionality of the EF battery. Item response theory models were used for the initial assessment of tasks and item parameters. Results demonstrated that each task worked invariantly across subgroups of preschoolers residing in low and middle-income households. Moreover, preschoolers showed differences on each task, and task scores reflect their latent EF skills in the low to moderate range. The battery was demonstrated as a feasible and reliable measure for use with low and middle-income countries specifically in Pakistan."
https://openalex.org/W4295904616,"Analysis of gene expression data is an attractive topic in the field of bioinformatics, and a typical application is to classify and predict individuals' diseases or tumors by treating gene expression values as predictors. A primary challenge of this study comes from ultrahigh-dimensionality, which makes that (i) many predictors in the dataset might be non-informative, (ii) pairwise dependence structures possibly exist among high-dimensional predictors, yielding the network structure. While many supervised learning methods have been developed, it is expected that the prediction performance would be affected if impacts of ultrahigh-dimensionality were not carefully addressed. In this paper, we propose a new statistical learning algorithm to deal with multi-classification subject to ultrahigh-dimensional gene expressions. In the proposed algorithm, we employ the model-free feature screening method to retain informative gene expression values from ultrahigh-dimensional data, and then construct predictive models with network structures of selected gene expression accommodated. Different from existing supervised learning methods that build predictive models based on entire dataset, our approach is able to identify informative predictors and dependence structures for gene expression. Throughout analysis of a real dataset, we find that the proposed algorithm gives precise classification as well as accurate prediction, and outperforms some commonly used supervised learning methods."
https://openalex.org/W4295904673,"With the development of society, the application of mobile robots in industry and life is increasingly extensive, and the local path planning of mobile robots in unknown environments is a problem that needs to be solved. Aiming at the problem that the traditional beetle antennae search (BAS) algorithm can easily fall into local optimum and the optimization accuracy is low, we propose an improved beetle antennae search. It introduces a map safety threshold, the addition of virtual target points, and the smoothing of the path. Map safety threshold means extra space with obstacles at all times, improving path reliability by avoiding collisions. Adding virtual target points reduces situations where the vehicle gets stuck in local optima. The B-spline smoothing path reduces the original path’s straight turns to improve the path’s robustness. The effectiveness and superiority of the algorithm are verified by comparing and testing the existing path planning algorithms through simulation in different environments."
https://openalex.org/W4295904749,"Background Short bowel syndrome and its resultant nutritional deficiencies are the most common cause of intestinal failure. Significant intestinal lengthening using intraluminal springs is feasible in porcine models using an external plication technique. We hypothesize that an internal plication technique will yield significant intestinal lengthening, which may lead to future endoscopic spring placement. Methods Uncompressed springs measuring 7.5 cm with a diameter of 1.0 cm were compressed to 2.0 cm. A gelatin-encapsulated compressed nitinol spring was inserted into the jejunal lumen of juvenile pigs and held in place with endoluminal sutures just proximal and distal to the spring-containing segment. A control segment distal to the spring was marked. Pigs were euthanized on postoperative day 7. Spring and control segments were collected for analyses. Results There was an average lengthening by 72% of the spring segment compared to the control segment. Two out of 7 springs stayed within both sets of plications and doubled in length. Histology showed normal mucosal integrity of the spring segment and plicated areas with similar muscular thickness but increased crypt depth and villus length compared to the control segment. Conclusion Internal plication resulted in significant bowel lengthening. Five springs had slipped through proximal, distal or both sets of plications, resulting in less lengthening than those that remained fixed. A more consistent methodology for endoluminal suturing is needed to produce more lengthening."
https://openalex.org/W4295905105,"Background A clustering of cardiovascular risk factors is denoted the metabolic syndrome (MetS), but the mechanistic underpinnings of this clustering is not clear. Using large-scale metabolomics, we aimed to find a metabolic profile common for all five components of MetS. Methods and findings 791 annotated non-xenobiotic metabolites were measured by ultra-performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry in five different population-based samples (Discovery samples: EpiHealth, n = 2342 and SCAPIS-Uppsala, n = 4985. Replication sample: SCAPIS-Malmö, n = 3978, Characterization samples: PIVUS, n = 604 and POEM, n = 501). MetS was defined by the NCEP/consensus criteria. Fifteen metabolites were related to all five components of MetS (blood pressure, waist circumference, glucose, HDL-cholesterol and triglycerides) at a false discovery rate of &lt;0.05 with adjustments for BMI and several life-style factors. They represented different metabolic classes, such as amino acids, simple carbohydrates, androgenic steroids, corticosteroids, co-factors and vitamins, ceramides, carnitines, fatty acids, phospholipids and metabolonic lactone sulfate. All 15 metabolites were related to insulin sensitivity (Matsuda index) in POEM, but only Palmitoyl-oleoyl-GPE (16:0/18:1), a glycerophospholipid, was related to incident cardiovascular disease over 8.6 years follow-up in the EpiHealth sample following adjustment for cardiovascular risk factors (HR 1.32 for a SD change, 95%CI 1.07–1.63). Conclusion A complex metabolic profile was related to all cardiovascular risk factors included in MetS independently of BMI. This profile was also related to insulin sensitivity, which provide further support for the importance of insulin sensitivity as an important underlying mechanism in the clustering of cardiovascular risk factors."

In the present study, the trichome density of leaves from two Chinese cabbage cultivars with and without trichomes treated at low temperature are analyzed by biological microscope, and the differentially expressed genes related to trichomes formation were screened through transcriptome sequencing. The results showed that the number of leaves trichomes was reduced by 34.7% at low temperature compared with room temperature. A total of 661 differentially expression genes effecting trichomes formation were identified at the CT vs C, LCT vs LC, CT vs LCT. Several differentially expression genes from every comparison group were enriched in plant hormone signal transduction and amino acid biosynthesis pathway. Combined with the central genes obtained by WGCNA analysis, five candidate genes Bra029778 , Bra026393 , Bra030270 , Bra037264 and Bra009655 were screened. qRT-PCR analysis verified that the gene expression differences were in line with the trend of transcriptome data. This study not only found possible new key genes and laid a foundation for revealing the molecular mechanism regulating the formation of trichome in Chinese cabbage, but also provided a new way to study plant surface trichomes."

Results show that kindergarten and second grade children in the-""Stop and Think""-condition have higher monitoring accuracy than the control group. Implementing a time window thus seems to support children in their evaluation of different certainty levels. Relating individual differences in independently measured inhibitory control skills revealed a correlation between monitoring and inhibition for kindergarteners."
https://openalex.org/W4295908057,"The analysis of pathological images, such as cell counting and nuclear morphological measurement, is an essential part in clinical histopathology researches. Due to the diversity of uncertain cell boundaries after staining, automated nuclei segmentation of Hematoxylin-Eosin (HE) stained pathological images remains challenging. Although better performances could be achieved than most of classic image processing methods do, manual labeling is still necessary in a majority of current machine learning based segmentation strategies, which restricts further improvements of efficiency and accuracy. Aiming at the requirements of stable and efficient high-throughput pathological image analysis, an automated Feature Global Delivery Connection Network (FGDC-net) is proposed for nuclei segmentation of HE stained images. Firstly, training sample patches and their corresponding asymmetric labels are automatically generated based on a Full Mixup strategy from RGB to HSV color space. Secondly, in order to add connections between adjacent layers and achieve the purpose of feature selection, FGDC module is designed by removing the jumping connections between codecs commonly used in UNet-based image segmentation networks, which learns the relationships between channels in each layer and pass information selectively. Finally, a dynamic training strategy based on mixed loss is used to increase the generalization capability of the model by flexible epochs. The proposed improvements were verified by the ablation experiments on multiple open databases and own clinical meningioma dataset. Experimental results on multiple datasets showed that FGDC-net could effectively improve the segmentation performances of HE stained pathological images without manual interventions, and provide valuable references for clinical pathological analysis."
https://openalex.org/W4295908585,"With the continuous development of deep learning, more and more domains use deep learning technique to solve key problems. The security issues of deep learning models have also received more and more attention. Nowadays, malware has become a huge security threat in cyberspace. Traditional signature-based malware detection methods are not adaptable to the current large-scale malware detection. Thus many deep learning-based malware detection models are widely used in real malware detection scenarios. Therefore, we need to secure the deep learning-based malware detection models. However, model testing currently focuses on image and natural language processing models. There is no related work to test deep learning-based malware detection models specifically. Therefore, to fill this gap, we propose MalFuzz. MalFuzz uses the idea of coverage-guided fuzzing to test deep learning-based malware detection models. To solve the model state representation problem, MalFuzz uses the first and last layer neuron values to approximately represent the model state. To solve the new coverage calculation problem, MalFuzz uses the fast approximate nearest neighbor algorithm to compute the new coverage. The mutation strategy and seed selection strategy in image model or natural language processing model testing is not appropriate in deep learning-based malware detection model testing. Hence MalFuzz designs the seed selection strategy and seed mutation strategy for malware detection model testing. We performed extensive experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of MalFuzz. Based on MalConv, Convnet, and CNN 2-d, we compared the modified TensorFuzz and MAB-malware with MalFuzz. Experiment results show that MalFuzz can detect more model classification errors. Likewise, the mutation operation of MalFuzz can retain the original functionality of malware with high probability. Moreover, the seed selection strategy of MalFuzz can help us explore the model state space quickly."
https://openalex.org/W3180123915,"The Gould and Fernandez local brokerage measure defines brokering roles based on the group membership of the nodes from the incoming and outgoing edges. This paper extends on this brokerage measure to account for weighted edges and introduces the Weighted–Normalized Gould–Fernandez measure (WNGF). The value added of this new measure is demonstrated empirically with both a macro level trade network and a micro level organization network. The measure is first applied to the EUREGIO inter-regional trade dataset and then to an organizational network in a research and development (R&amp;D) group. The results gained from the WNGF measure are compared to those from two dichotomized networks: a threshold and a multiscale backbone network. The results show that the WNGF generates valid results, consistent with those of the dichotomized network. In addition, it provides the following advantages: (i) it ensures information retention; (ii) since no alterations and decisions have to be made on how to dichotomize the network, the WNGF frees the user from the burden of making assumptions; (iii) it provides a nuanced understanding of each node’s brokerage role. These advantages are of special importance when the role of less connected nodes is considered. The two empirical networks used here are for illustrative purposes. Possible applications of WNGF span beyond regional and organizational studies, and into all those contexts where retaining weights is important, for example by accounting for persisting or repeating edges compared to one-time interactions. WNGF can also be used to further analyze networks that measure how often people meet, talk, text, like, or retweet. WNGF makes a relevant methodological contribution as it offers a way to analyze brokerage in weighted, directed, and even complete graphs without information loss that can be used across disciplines and different type of networks."

https://openalex.org/W4295898349,"Females are underrepresented in the science, technology, engineering, mathematics and medicine (STEMM) disciplines globally and although progress has been made, the gender gap persists. Our aim was to explore gender parity in the context of gender representation and internal collaboration at the Cyprus Institute of Neurology and Genetics (CING), a leading national biomedical organisation accredited as an equal opportunity employer. Towards this aim we (1) explored trends in gender parity within the different departments, positions and qualifications and in student representation in the CING’s postgraduate school and, (2) investigated the degree of collaboration between male and female researchers within the Institute and the degree of influence within its co-authorship network. We recorded an over-representation of females both in the CING employees and the postgraduate students. The observed female over-representation in pooled CING employees was consistent with a similar over-representation in less senior positions and was contrasted with an observed male over-representation in only one middle rank and culminated in gender equality in the top rank in employee hierarchy. In terms of collaboration, both males and females tended to collaborate with each other without any significant preference to either inter-group or intra-group collaboration. Further comparison of the two groups with respect to their influence in the network in terms of occupying the positions of highest centrality scores, indicated that both gender and seniority level (head vs non-head) were significant in shaping the authors’ influence, with no significant difference in those belonging in the same seniority level with respect to their gender. To conclude, our study has validated the formal recognition of the CING’s policies and procedures pertinent to its egalitarian culture through the majority of the metrics of gender equality assessed in this study and has provided an extendable paradigm for evaluating gender parity in academic organizations."

In cases of congenital sensory deprivation, the feedback language learners have access to for mapping visible and invisible orofacial articulation is impoverished. Although the effects of blindness on the movements of the lips, jaw, and tongue have been documented in francophone adults, not much is known about their consequences for speech intelligibility. The objective of this study is to investigate the effects of congenital visual deprivation on vowel intelligibility in adult speakers of Canadian French.Twenty adult listeners performed two perceptual identification tasks in which vowels produced by congenitally blind adults and sighted adults were used as stimuli. The vowels were presented in the auditory, visual, and audiovisual modalities (experiment 1) and at different signal-to-noise ratios in the audiovisual modality (experiment 2). Correct identification scores were calculated. Sequential information analyses were also conducted to assess the amount of information transmitted to the listeners along the three vowel features of height, place of articulation, and rounding.The results showed that, although blind speakers did not differ from their sighted peers in the auditory modality, they had lower scores in the audiovisual and visual modalities. Some vowels produced by blind speakers are also less robust in noise than those produced by sighted speakers.Together, the results suggest that adult blind speakers have learned to adapt to their sensory loss so that they can successfully achieve intelligible vowel targets in non-noisy conditions but that they produce less intelligible speech in noisy conditions. Thus, the trade-off between visible (lips) and invisible (tongue) articulatory cues observed between vowels produced by blind and sighted speakers is not equivalent in terms of perceptual efficiency."

In the current study, we assessed whether the relationship between COVID-related distress and compulsive buying is mediated by task-focused and emotion-focused coping. We also examined whether these associations were invariant over time as the pandemic unfolded.Self-report surveys were administered online in the United States in the first six months of the pandemic (March-October 2020) in sampling batches of 25 participants every three days, resulting in a total sample of N = 1,418 (40% female, mean age = 36.6). We carried out structural equation modeling to assess whether the relationship between distress related to COVID-19 and compulsive buying is mediated by task-focused and emotion-focused coping. Time was used as a grouping variable based on events related to the pandemic in the U.S. to calculate model invariance across three time periods.The results indicated significant mediation between distress, emotion-focused coping, and compulsive buying, but not between task-focused coping and compulsive buying. The mediation model showed excellent fit to the data (χ² = 1119.377, df = 420, RMSEA = 0.059 [0.055-0.064], SRMR = 0.049, CFI = 0.951, TLI = 0.947). Models were not invariant across the three examined time periods.Our results indicate that compulsive buying is more likely to occur in relation to emotion-focused coping as a response to COVID-related distress than in relation to task-focused coping, especially during periods of increasing distress. However, model paths varied during the course of the pandemic."
https://openalex.org/W4295900530,"Market competition is considered to have a significant impact on product diversification, but related issues are rarely discussed on a city scale. To analyze the diversification of export commodities and export market of 270 Chinese cities, this study uses data from 2000 to 2017 based on the commodity concentration index, market concentration index, export similarity index, spatial stratified heterogeneity, and the Almon lag model. The study's findings are: (1) The diversification of exports in most Chinese cities increased, which was higher in more developed cities in the southeast than in less developed ones in the northwest. With time, the degree of commodity and market diversification in some developed southeast Chinese cities (e.g., Shanghai) declined. This indicates the difference in and complexity of the evolution of export development in hundreds of Chinese cities between 2000 and 2017. (2) The export competition between cities became increasingly fierce, which effectively urged most of them to improve their export diversification levels. Facing increasing export competition pressure, 81.11% of the total number of cities will enhance the diversification of export commodities to cope with challenges posed by other cities. But only 56.67% will further expand the export market when the pressure of export competition increases. The biggest contribution of this study is the finding that for most Chinese cities, when export competition from other domestic cities increases, increasing diversification of products becomes a wise choice. However, the influence of competition on the diversification degree of the city's export market is relatively weak. This study provides not only a new perspective for existing research on urban export trade, but also valuable information for cities to form a more profitable and robust trading system."
https://openalex.org/W4295900621,"This work proposed a novel procedure of Water Quality Index (WQI) development that could be used for practical applications on a local or regional scale, based on available monitoring data. Principal component analysis (PCA) was applied to the monthly data of 11 water quality parameters (pH, conductivity (EC), total suspended solid (TSS), dissolved oxygen (DO), five -day biological oxygen demand (BOD), chemical oxygen demand (COD), ammonia (N-NH 4 ), nitrate (N-NO 3 ), phosphate (P-PO 4 ), total coliform, and total dissolved iron monitored at 11 sites at Huong river in the years 2014–2016. From the PCA, the three extracted principal components explained 67% of the total variance of original variables. From the set of communality values, the weight (w i ) for each parameter was determined. Linear sub-index functions were established based on the permissible limits from the National Technical Regulations on Surface Water Quality set up by the Vietnam Environment Agency (VEA) to derive the sub-index (q i ) for each parameter. The multiplicative formula that is the product of the sub-indices (q i ) raised to the respective weights (w i ), was used for calculation of the final WQI values. The proposed index (WQI) was then applied to the river with quarterly data of the 11 parameters monitored at ten sites in the years 2017–2020. The WQI representatively reflected the actual status of the river overall water quality, of which 97.8% of the WQI values belonged to grades of EXCELLENT and GOOD, and 2.2% of grade MODERATE. Comparison between the river water quality evaluations resulting from the developed WQI with the WQI adopted by National Sanitation Foundation (NSF-WQI) and the index issued by Vietnam Environment Agency (VN-WQI) indicated that the proposed WQI was more suitable for river quality assessment."
https://openalex.org/W4295900657,"Naked mole-rats are a long-lived rodent species (current lifespan >37 years) and an increasingly popular biomedical model. Naked mole-rats exhibit neuroplasticity across their long lifespan. Previous studies have begun to investigate their neurogenic patterns. Here, we test the hypothesis that neuronal maturation is extended in this long-lived rodent. We characterize cell proliferation and neuronal maturation in established rodent neurogenic regions over 12 months following seven days of consecutive BrdU injection. Given that naked mole-rats are eusocial (high reproductive skew where only a few socially-dominant individuals reproduce), we also looked at proliferation in brain regions relevant to the social-decision making network. Finally, we measured co-expression of EdU (newly-born cells), DCX (immature neuron marker), and NeuN (mature neuron marker) to assess the timeline of neuronal maturation in adult naked mole-rats. This work reaffirms the subventricular zone as the main source of adult cell proliferation and suggests conservation of the rostral migratory stream in this species. Our profiling of socially-relevant brain regions suggests that future work which manipulates environmental context can unveil how newly-born cells integrate into circuitry and facilitate adult neuroplasticity. We also find naked mole-rat neuronal maturation sits at the intersection of rodents and long-lived, non-rodent species: while neurons can mature by 3 weeks (rodent-like), most neurons mature at 5 months and hippocampal neurogenic levels are low (like long-lived species). These data establish a timeline for future investigations of longevity- and socially-related manipulations of naked mole-rat adult neurogenesis."

Many women work in education and care, two branches characterised by high SA levels; it is not known if the link between childbirth and SA in these branches differs between private and public sectors. We examined SA and disability pension (DP) in relation to childbirth among women working in the education and care branches, and if these patterns differed between public and private sectors.We performed a Swedish register-based cohort study. Study participants were nulliparous women living in Sweden in December 2004 and employed in education or care (n = 120,013). We compared SA/DP in the three years before and after 2005 among women who had no childbirth during follow-up (B0), had one childbirth in 2005 and no more (B1), and had one childbirth in 2005 and at least one more during follow-up (B1+). Analyses were performed for all and by public or private sector.Of all studied women, 70% worked in the public sector. Women in B1 and B1+ had, except for the year before childbirth, comparable or lower mean combined SA/DP days than women in the B0 group; women in the B1+ group had, except for the year before childbirth, the lowest mean level of SA/DP. We observed no substantial differences in these patterns between public and private sectors.Patterns of SA/DP among nulliparous women who did or did not give birth did not differ substantially between public and private sectors among women in the educational and care branches."
https://openalex.org/W4295900875,"UDP-glucose dehydrogenase (UGDH) generates essential precursors of hyaluronic acid (HA) synthesis, however mechanisms regulating its activity are unclear. We used enzyme histostaining and quantitative image analysis to test whether cytokines that stimulate HA synthesis upregulate UGDH activity. Fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS, from N = 6 human donors with knee pain) were cultured, freeze-thawed, and incubated for 1 hour with UDP-glucose, NAD+ and nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT) which allows UGDH to generate NADH, and NADH to reduce NBT to a blue stain. Compared to serum-free medium, FLS treated with PDGF showed 3-fold higher UGDH activity and 6-fold higher HA release, but IL-1beta/TGF-beta1 induced 27-fold higher HA release without enhancing UGDH activity. In selected proliferating cells, UGDH activity was lost in the cytosol, but preserved in the nucleus. Cell-free assays led us to discover that diaphorase, a cytosolic enzyme, or glutathione reductase, a nuclear enzyme, was necessary and sufficient for NADH to reduce NBT to a blue formazan dye in a 1-hour timeframe. Primary synovial fibroblasts and transformed A549 fibroblasts showed constitutive diaphorase/GR staining activity that varied according to supplied NADH levels, with relatively stronger UGDH and diaphorase activity in A549 cells. Unilateral knee injury in New Zealand White rabbits (N = 3) stimulated a coordinated increase in synovial membrane UGDH and diaphorase activity, but higher synovial fluid HA in only 2 out of 3 injured joints. UGDH activity (but not diaphorase) was abolished by N-ethyl maleimide, and inhibited by peroxide or UDP-xylose. Our results do not support the hypothesis that UGDH is a rate-liming enzyme for HA synthesis under catabolic inflammatory conditions that can oxidize and inactivate the UGDH active site cysteine. Our novel data suggest a model where UGDH activity is controlled by a redox switch, where intracellular peroxide inactivates, and high glutathione and diaphorase promote UGDH activity by maintaining the active site cysteine in a reduced state, and by recycling NAD+ from NADH."
https://openalex.org/W4295901156,"Applications of synthetic biology spanning human health, industrial bioproduction, and ecosystem monitoring often require small molecule sensing capabilities, typically in the form of genetically encoded small molecule biosensors. Critical to the deployment of greater numbers of these systems are methods that support the rapid development of such biosensors against a broad range of small molecule targets. Here, we use a previously developed method for selection of RNA biosensors against unmodified small molecules (DRIVER) to perform a selection against a densely multiplexed mixture of small molecules, representative of those employed in high-throughput drug screening. Using a mixture of 5,120 target compounds randomly sampled from a large diversity drug screening library, we performed a 95-round selection and then analyzed the enriched RNA biosensor library using next generation sequencing (NGS). From our analysis, we identified RNA biosensors with at least 2-fold change in signal in the presence of at least 217 distinct target compounds with sensitivities down to 25 nM. Although many of these biosensors respond to multiple targets, clustering analysis indicated at least 150 different small-molecule sensing patterns. We also built a classifier that was able to predict whether the biosensors would respond to a new compound with an average precision of 0.82. Since the target compound library was designed to be representative of larger diversity compound libraries, we expect that the described approach can be used with similar compound libraries to identify aptamers against other small molecules with a similar success rate. The new RNA biosensors (or their component aptamers) described in this work can be further optimized and used in applications such as biosensing, gene control, or enzyme evolution. In addition, the data presented here provide an expanded compendium of new RNA aptamers compared to the 82 small molecule RNA aptamers published in the literature, allowing further bioinformatic analyses of the general classes of small molecules for which RNA aptamers can be found."

However, there is no consensus regarding how to best instruct OBGYN trainees in the clinical skills related to opioid and other substance use disorders (SUD). Study objectives were (1) to assess the effectiveness a SUD curriculum to improve self-reported competence among OBGYN residents and (2) to explore its effectiveness to improve attending evaluations of residents’ clinical skills as well as its feasibility and acceptability from the resident perspective. Methods A pilot 3-session curriculum was developed and adapted to SUD screening and treatment which included readings, didactics, and supervised outpatient clinical experiences for OBGYN post-graduate year 1 (PGY-1) residents rotating through an integrated OBGYN-SUD clinic. Eighteen residents completed pre and post clinical skills self-assessments (SUD screening, counseling, referring, Motivational Interviewing) using an adapted Zwisch Rating Scale (range 1–5). Scores were compared between time points using paired t-tests. Sub-samples also (a) were evaluated by the attending on three relevant Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education Milestones (ACGME) milestone sets using the web-based feedback program, myTIPreport (n = 10) and (b) completed a qualitative interview (n = 4). Results All PGY-1s (18/18) across three academic years completed the 3-session SUD curriculum. Clinical skill self-assessments improved significantly in all areas [SUD Screening (2.44 (0.98) vs 3.56 (0.62), p = &lt;0.01); Counseling (1.81 (0.71) vs 3.56 (0.51), p = &lt; .01; Referring (2.03 (0.74) vs 3.17 (0.71), p = &lt; .01; Motivational Interviewing (1.94 (1.06) vs 3.33 (0.69), p = &lt; .01)]. Milestone set levels assigned by attending evaluations (n = 10) also improved. Qualitative data (n = 4) revealed high acceptability; all curriculum components were viewed positively, and feedback was provided (e.g., desire for more patient exposures). Conclusion A pilot SUD curriculum tailored for OBGYN PGY-1 residents that goes beyond opioid prescribing to encompass SUD management is feasible, acceptable and likely effective at improving SUD core clinical skills."

We assess these functions in young people (YP) with perinatal HIV (PHIV) (with or without a previous AIDS-defining illness) and a comparable group of HIV-negative YP. 234 PHIV and 68 HIV-negative YP completed 9 tests; 5 National Institutes of Health (NIH) Toolbox tests (2 executive function, 1 speed of information processing, 2 memory); 2 Hopkins Verbal Learning Test Revised (HVLT-R) (learning (L), delayed recall (R)), and 2 verbal application measures. Z-scores for each test were calculated using normative data and averaged by domain where appropriate. The effect of predictors on test scores in the three domains with the lowest z-scores were analysed using linear regression. 139(59%) and 48(71%) PHIV and HIV-negative YP were female, 202(86%) and 52(76%) Black, and median age was 19 [17, 21] and 18 [16, 21] years respectively. 55(24%) PHIV had a previous Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) class C AIDS-defining diagnosis (PHIV/C). For HVLT-R, there was a trend towards PHIV/C YP having the lowest mean z-scores (L -1.5 (95% CI -1.8,-1.2), R -1.7 (-2.0,-1.4)) followed by PHIV without a CDC C diagnosis (L -1.3 (-1.4,-1.1), R -1.4 (-1.5,-1.2)) and then the HIV-negative group (L -1.0 (-1.3,-0.7), R -1.1 (-1.3,-0.8)); all were greater than 1 SD below the reference mean. The same trend was seen for verbal application measures; however, z-scores were within 1 SD below the reference mean. NIH Toolbox tests were similar for all groups. In multivariable analyses PHIV/C and Black ethnicity predicted lower HVLT-R scores. Black ethnicity also predicted lower executive function scores, however each year increase in age predicted higher scores. In conclusion, cognitive performance in verbal learning and recall fell below population normative scores, and was more pronounced in PHIV/C, supporting wider findings that earlier antiretroviral therapy initiation, before the occurrence of AIDS-defining conditions, may protect aspects of cognitive development."
https://openalex.org/W4295903778,"In Malaysia, the trend of HIV transmission has shifted from intravenous drug use to sexual intercourse, and men who have sex with men (MSM) have become the main driver due to high-risk sexual behaviour. Thus, treatment and care, which also involves counselling, for men who have sex with men and who are living with HIV (MSM living with HIV) are crucial. This study aims to explore the experiences of MSM living with HIV and participating in counselling session during treatment and care at two public hospitals.This qualitative study with a grounded-theory approach was conducted at two public hospitals in Malaysia. Five participants who were MSM living with HIV were selected through purposive sampling. They participated in semi-structured interviews, non-participant observations, and diary entries, each of which was conducted three times. The data were analysed using grounded theory with N-Vivo 8 to determine themes.The participants were found to experience feelings of emptiness and hopelessness because of their unreadiness to accept their HIV status. These feelings made their participation in counselling sessions challenging. Consequently, the participants found counselling sessions unhelpful due to their unwillingness to participate in the counselling relationship.The findings of the study highlight the need for counselling sessions to focus more on feelings related to unreadiness to improve the self-esteem and ability to create positive relationships with others of MSM living with HIV. It is also important to strengthen the training and skills among HIV counsellors to enhance counselling services for these men."
https://openalex.org/W4295904679,"We study scheduling mechanisms that explore the trade-off between containing the spread of COVID-19 and performing in-person activity in organizations. Our mechanisms, referred to as group scheduling , are based on partitioning the population randomly into groups and scheduling each group on appropriate days with possible gaps (when no one is working and all are quarantined). Each group interacts with no other group and, importantly, any person who is symptomatic in a group is quarantined. We show that our mechanisms effectively trade-off in-person activity for more effective control of the COVID-19 virus spread. In particular, we show that a mechanism which partitions the population into two groups that alternatively work in-person for five days each, flatlines the number of COVID-19 cases quite effectively, while still maintaining in-person activity at 70% of pre-COVID-19 level. Other mechanisms that partitions into two groups with less continuous work days or more spacing or three groups achieve even more aggressive control of the virus at the cost of a somewhat lower in-person activity (about 50%). We demonstrate the efficacy of our mechanisms by theoretical analysis and extensive experimental simulations on various epidemiological models based on real-world data."
https://openalex.org/W4295905998,"Soil acidity with associated low nutrient availability is one of the major constraints to soybean production in southwestern Ethiopia. Integrated use of lime and acid-tolerant crops is believed to reduce soil acidity and improve crop production. The experiment was conducted in the field condition of Mettu, southwestern Ethiopia during the 2017/18 main cropping season. The experiment comprised fifteen soybean genotypes and two soil amendment (lime and unlimed) treatments arranged in a split-plot design with three replications. For each treatment, four rows were planted per plot; data related to growth, root, nodule, and yield of the crop were collected at a necessary stage for each. Liming and genotype interaction had significantly (P = 0.01) affected all parameters considered except for hundred seed weight and root volume and were affected only by the main effects of genotypes and liming. A significant reduction for most parameters was found on lime-untreated soil than treated soil. Though some genotypes showed higher performance for root, growth parameters, and yield components under unlimed soils; however, gave higher yield and yield components, when grown on lime-untreated with an average yield reduction of 13.7%, due to soil acidity. The maximum grain yield of (1943.93 kg ha-1) was obtained under lime treated acid soil from PI567046A genotype; while the lowest (510.49 kg ha-1) were recorded from SCS-1genotype under the lime untreated acid soil. Genotype BRS268 showed higher yield (1319.83 kg ha-1) under lime untreated acid soil than lime treated acid soil (1143.47 kg ha-1) and showed less reduction percentage for a number of the nodules, root weight, and number of seeds per plant; while PI567046A showed high reduction percentage for yield, biomass, number of pod and seed per plant. A high difference was observed among the soybean genotypes for soil acidity tolerance, which might be further exploited by breeders for the genetic improvement of soybean. Genotype BRS268 had performed better than other tested genotypes under increased soil acidity. selection would be effective to improve soybean genotypes performance on acid soils and identify low Phosphorus tolerant genotype that helps smallholder farmers optimize soybean productivity on acid soils in the study area. HAWASSA-04 variety is the most tolerant among the tested materials. However, further study is required by considering additional genotypes to reach a conclusive recommendation."
https://openalex.org/W4295908051,"Both albuminuria and depression are associated with cardiovascular disease, reflecting low-grade systemic inflammation and endothelial dysfunction. They share risk factors including weight, blood pressure, smoking and blood glucose levels. This longitudinal study aimed to examine bidirectional associations between depression symptoms, indexed by the Hospital Anxiety and Depression scale (HADS), and the inflammation marker albuminuria.2909 persons provided urine samples in both the second (HUNT2, 1995-97) and third wave (HUNT3, 2006-2008) of the Trøndelag Health Survey, Norway. We used a generalized linear regression model (GLM) and ANOVA to assess the association between albuminuria levels (exposure HUNT2) with depression symptoms (outcome in HUNT3); and between depression symptoms (exposure HUNT2) with albuminuria (outcome HUNT3). Depression symptoms were measured with the HADS Depression Scale, analyzed utilising the full 7 items version and analyses restricted to the first 4 items (HADS-D and HADS-4). We accounted for confounders including baseline individual levels of the exposure variables.In this 10-years follow-up study, we found no statistical evidence for an association between baseline depression symptoms and subsequent albuminuria, nor between baseline albuminuria and subsequent depression symptoms. For albuminuria, only 0.04% was explained by prior depression, and for depression, only 0.007% was explained by previous albuminuria levels. The results were essentially the same for the shorter HADS-4 measure.There does not appear to be a longitudinal association between albuminuria and depression measured by the HADS."
https://openalex.org/W4295908345,"A long-term projection model based on nationally representative data and tracking disease progression across Alzheimer's disease continuum is important for economics evaluation of Alzheimer's disease and other dementias (ADOD) therapy.The Health and Retirement Study (HRS) includes an adapted version of the Telephone Interview for Cognitive Status (TICS27) to evaluate respondents' cognitive function. We developed an ordered probit transition model to predict future TICS27 score. This transition model is utilized in the Future Elderly Model (FEM), a dynamic microsimulation model of health and health-related economic outcomes for the US population. We validated the FEM TICS27 model using a five-fold cross validation approach, by comparing 10-year (2006-2016) simulated outcomes against observed HRS data.In aggregate, the distribution of TICS27 scores after ten years of FEM simulation matches the HRS. FEM's assignment of cognitive/mortality status also matches those observed in HRS on the population level. At the individual level, the area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curve is 0.904 for prediction of dementia or dead with dementia in 10 years, the AUROC for predicting significant cognitive decline in two years for mild cognitive impairment patients is 0.722.The FEM TICS27 model demonstrates its predictive accuracy for both two- and ten-year cognitive outcomes. Our cognition projection model is unique in its validation with an unbiased approach, resulting in a high-quality platform for assessing the burden of cognitive decline and translating the benefit of innovative therapies into long-term value to society."
https://openalex.org/W4295908582,"Paediatric early warning systems (PEWS) are a means of tracking physiological state and alerting healthcare professionals about signs of deterioration, triggering a clinical review and/or escalation of care of children. A proactive end-to-end deterioration solution (the DETECT surveillance system) with an embedded e-PEWS that included sepsis screening was introduced across a tertiary children's hospital. One component of the implementation programme was a sub-study to determine an understanding of the DETECT e-PEWS in terms of its clinical utility and its acceptability.This study aimed to examine how parents and health professionals view and engage with the DETECT e-PEWS apps, with a particular focus on its clinical utility and its acceptability.A prospective, closed (tick box or sliding scale) and open (text based) question, e-survey of parents (n = 137) and health professionals (n = 151) with experience of DETECT e-PEWS. Data were collected between February 2020 and February 2021.Quantitative data were analysed using descriptive and inferential statistics and qualitative data with generic thematic analysis. Overall, both clinical utility and acceptability (across seven constructs) were high across both stakeholder groups although some challenges to utility (e.g., sensitivity of triggers within specific patient populations) and acceptability (e.g., burden related to having to carry extra technology) were identified.Despite the multifaceted nature of the intervention and the complexity of implementation across a hospital, the system demonstrated clinical utility and acceptability across two key groups of stakeholders: parents and health professionals."
https://openalex.org/W4295908964,"Numerosity estimation around the subitizing range is facilitated by a shape-template matching process and shape-coding mechanisms are selective to visual features such as colour and luminance contrast polarity. Objects in natural scenes are often embedded within other objects or textured surfaces. Numerosity estimation is improved when objects are grouped into small clusters of the same colour, a phenomenon termed groupitizing, which is thought to leverage on the subitizing system. Here we investigate whether numerosity mechanisms around the subitizing range are selective to colour, luminance contrast polarity and orientation, and how spatial organisation of context and target elements modulates target numerosity estimation. Stimuli consisted of a small number (3-to-6) of target elements presented either in isolation or embedded within context elements. To examine selectivity to colour, luminance polarity and orientation, we compared target-only conditions in which all elements were either the same or different along one of these feature dimensions. We found comparable performance in the same and different feature conditions, revealing that subitizing mechanism do not depend on 'on-off' luminance-polarity, colour or orientation channel interactions. We also measured the effect of varying spatial organisation of (i) context, by arranging the elements either in a grid, mirror-symmetric, translation-symmetric or random; (ii) target, by placing the elements either mirror-symmetric, on the vertices of simple shapes or random. Our results indicate higher accuracy and lower RTs in the grid compared to all other context types, with mirror symmetric, translation and random arrangements having comparable effects on target numerosity. We also found improved performance with shape-target followed by symmetric and random target arrangements in the absence and presence of context. These findings indicate that numerosity mechanisms around the subitizing range are not selective to colour, luminance polarity and orientation, and that symmetric, translation and random contexts organisations inhibit target-numerosity encoding stronger than regular/grid context."
