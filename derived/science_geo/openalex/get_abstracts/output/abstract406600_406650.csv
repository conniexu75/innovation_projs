https://openalex.org/W2115862579,"We report the identification of 67 previously undescribed histone modifications, increasing the current number of known histone marks by about 70%. We further investigated one of the marks, lysine crotonylation (Kcr), confirming that it represents an evolutionarily-conserved histone posttranslational modification. The unique structure and genomic localization of histone Kcr suggest that it is mechanistically and functionally different from histone lysine acetylation (Kac). Specifically, in both human somatic and mouse male germ cell genomes, histone Kcr marks either active promoters or potential enhancers. In male germinal cells immediately following meiosis, Kcr is enriched on sex chromosomes and specifically marks testis-specific genes, including a significant proportion of X-linked genes that escape sex chromosome inactivation in haploid cells. These results therefore dramatically extend the repertoire of histone PTM sites and designate Kcr as a specific mark of active sex chromosome-linked genes in postmeiotic male germ cells."

https://openalex.org/W2005928313,"Two groups identify the regulation of death-receptor-induced necroptosis as an epithelial intrinsic mechanism that is important for the maintenance of immune homeostasis and the prevention of intestinal inflammation in mice. Welz et al. describe an unexpected physiological function for FADD (Fas-associated protein with death domain), an adaptor protein required for death-receptor-induced apoptosis. Mice with intestinal epithelial specific knockout of FADD develop severe colon inflammation due to increased death of FADD-deficient colonic epithelial cells. Günther et al. report a novel and unexpected function of caspase-8 in maintaining immune homeostasis in the gut. Caspase-8 expression by gut epithelial cells is shown to protect mice from TNF-mediated Paneth cell death and intestinal inflammation. Increased expression of the protein RIP3 was associated with the TNF-induced pathology, and elevated RIP3 expression was also found in intestinal Paneth cells of patients with Crohn's disease. Dysfunction of the intestinal epithelium is believed to result in the excessive translocation of commensal bacteria into the bowel wall that drives chronic mucosal inflammation in Crohn’s disease, an incurable inflammatory bowel disease in humans characterized by inflammation of the terminal ileum1. In healthy individuals, the intestinal epithelium maintains a physical barrier, established by the tight contact of cells. Moreover, specialized epithelial cells such as Paneth cells and goblet cells provide innate immune defence functions by secreting mucus and antimicrobial peptides, which hamper access and survival of bacteria adjacent to the epithelium2. Epithelial cell death is a hallmark of intestinal inflammation and has been discussed as a possible pathogenic mechanism driving Crohn’s disease in humans3. However, the regulation of epithelial cell death and its role in intestinal homeostasis remain poorly understood. Here we demonstrate a critical role for caspase-8 in regulating necroptosis of intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) and terminal ileitis. Mice with a conditional deletion of caspase-8 in the intestinal epithelium (Casp8ΔIEC) spontaneously developed inflammatory lesions in the terminal ileum and were highly susceptible to colitis. Casp8ΔIEC mice lacked Paneth cells and showed reduced numbers of goblet cells, indicating dysregulated antimicrobial immune cell functions of the intestinal epithelium. Casp8ΔIEC mice showed increased cell death in the Paneth cell area of small intestinal crypts. Epithelial cell death was induced by tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α, was associated with increased expression of receptor-interacting protein 3 (Rip3; also known as Ripk3) and could be inhibited on blockade of necroptosis. Lastly, we identified high levels of RIP3 in human Paneth cells and increased necroptosis in the terminal ileum of patients with Crohn’s disease, suggesting a potential role of necroptosis in the pathogenesis of this disease. Together, our data demonstrate a critical function of caspase-8 in regulating intestinal homeostasis and in protecting IECs from TNF-α-induced necroptotic cell death."

https://openalex.org/W2094247278,"The discovery of cytosine hydroxymethylation (5hmC) suggested a simple means of demethylating DNA and activating genes. Further experiments, however, unearthed an unexpectedly complex process, entailing both passive and active mechanisms of DNA demethylation by the ten-eleven translocation (TET) and AID/APOBEC families of enzymes. The consensus emerging from these studies is that removal of cytosine methylation in mammalian cells can occur by DNA repair. These reports highlight that in certain contexts, DNA methylation is not fixed but dynamic, requiring continuous regulation."
https://openalex.org/W1992974015,"Cytokine storm during viral infection is a prospective predictor of morbidity and mortality, yet the cellular sources remain undefined. Here, using genetic and chemical tools to probe functions of the S1P(1) receptor, we elucidate cellular and signaling mechanisms that are important in initiating cytokine storm. Whereas S1P(1) receptor is expressed on endothelial cells and lymphocytes within lung tissue, S1P(1) agonism suppresses cytokines and innate immune cell recruitment in wild-type and lymphocyte-deficient mice, identifying endothelial cells as central regulators of cytokine storm. Furthermore, our data reveal immune cell infiltration and cytokine production as distinct events that are both orchestrated by endothelial cells. Moreover, we demonstrate that suppression of early innate immune responses through S1P(1) signaling results in reduced mortality during infection with a human pathogenic strain of influenza virus. Modulation of endothelium with a specific agonist suggests that diseases in which amplification of cytokine storm is a significant pathological component could be chemically tractable."

https://openalex.org/W2021058886,"Molecular noise restricts the ability of an individual cell to resolve input signals of different strengths and gather information about the external environment. Transmitting information through complex signaling networks with redundancies can overcome this limitation. We developed an integrative theoretical and experimental framework, based on the formalism of information theory, to quantitatively predict and measure the amount of information transduced by molecular and cellular networks. Analyzing tumor necrosis factor (TNF) signaling revealed that individual TNF signaling pathways transduce information sufficient for accurate binary decisions, and an upstream bottleneck limits the information gained via multiple integrated pathways. Negative feedback to this bottleneck could both alleviate and enhance its limiting effect, despite decreasing noise. Bottlenecks likewise constrain information attained by networks signaling through multiple genes or cells."
https://openalex.org/W2096803927,"The Siberian Traps, a large region of volcanic rock produced more than 200 million years ago by a massive volcanic event, is a prime example of a large igneous province (LIP). Stephan Sobolev and colleagues present petrological evidence for a large amount of dense recycled oceanic crust in the head of the plume that was responsible for forming the Siberian Traps. Using this, they develop a thermomechanical model that predicts the observed lack of pre-magmatic uplift or lithospheric extension in the region. The model also indicates that massive degassing of carbon dioxide and hydrogen chloride from the plume could alone trigger a mass extinction, and predicts it happening before the main volcanic phase, in agreement with stratigraphic and geochronological data for the Siberian Traps and other LIPs. Large igneous provinces (LIPs) are known for their rapid production of enormous volumes of magma (up to several million cubic kilometres in less than a million years)1, for marked thinning of the lithosphere2,3, often ending with a continental break-up, and for their links to global environmental catastrophes4,5. Despite the importance of LIPs, controversy surrounds even the basic idea that they form through melting in the heads of thermal mantle plumes2,3,6,7,8,9,10. The Permo-Triassic Siberian Traps11—the type example and the largest continental LIP1,12—is located on thick cratonic lithosphere1,12 and was synchronous with the largest known mass-extinction event1. However, there is no evidence of pre-magmatic uplift or of a large lithospheric stretching7, as predicted above a plume head2,6,9. Moreover, estimates of magmatic CO2 degassing from the Siberian Traps are considered insufficient to trigger climatic crises13,14,15, leading to the hypothesis that the release of thermogenic gases from the sediment pile caused the mass extinction15,16. Here we present petrological evidence for a large amount (15 wt%) of dense recycled oceanic crust in the head of the plume and develop a thermomechanical model that predicts no pre-magmatic uplift and requires no lithospheric extension. The model implies extensive plume melting and heterogeneous erosion of the thick cratonic lithosphere over the course of a few hundred thousand years. The model suggests that massive degassing of CO2 and HCl, mostly from the recycled crust in the plume head, could alone trigger a mass extinction and predicts it happening before the main volcanic phase, in agreement with stratigraphic and geochronological data for the Siberian Traps and other LIPs5."

https://openalex.org/W2118530947,"Overconfidence is a major puzzle in evolutionary biology, economics and political science, because despite causing costly errors and policy failures, it remains a widespread bias in human judgement and decision-making. Animals too, in examples seen during conflict behaviour, are liable to overconfidence. Dominic Johnson and James Fowler use game theory to model the situations under which overconfidence is an advantage, and find that they occupy a large part of the parameter space. They also show that overconfidence and conflict tend to increase with greater resource availability. As long as the prize at stake sufficiently exceeds the cost of competing for it, it seems, fortune favours the brave. Confidence is an essential ingredient of success in a wide range of domains ranging from job performance and mental health to sports, business and combat1,2,3,4. Some authors have suggested that not just confidence but overconfidence—believing you are better than you are in reality—is advantageous because it serves to increase ambition, morale, resolve, persistence or the credibility of bluffing, generating a self-fulfilling prophecy in which exaggerated confidence actually increases the probability of success3,4,5,6,7,8. However, overconfidence also leads to faulty assessments, unrealistic expectations and hazardous decisions, so it remains a puzzle how such a false belief could evolve or remain stable in a population of competing strategies that include accurate, unbiased beliefs. Here we present an evolutionary model showing that, counterintuitively, overconfidence maximizes individual fitness and populations tend to become overconfident, as long as benefits from contested resources are sufficiently large compared with the cost of competition. In contrast, unbiased strategies are only stable under limited conditions. The fact that overconfident populations are evolutionarily stable in a wide range of environments may help to explain why overconfidence remains prevalent today, even if it contributes to hubris, market bubbles, financial collapses, policy failures, disasters and costly wars9,10,11,12,13."
https://openalex.org/W2086881223,"Complex genomic rearrangements (CGRs) consisting of two or more breakpoint junctions have been observed in genomic disorders. Recently, a chromosome catastrophe phenomenon termed chromothripsis, in which numerous genomic rearrangements are apparently acquired in one single catastrophic event, was described in multiple cancers. Here, we show that constitutionally acquired CGRs share similarities with cancer chromothripsis. In the 17 CGR cases investigated, we observed localization and multiple copy number changes including deletions, duplications, and/or triplications, as well as extensive translocations and inversions. Genomic rearrangements involved varied in size and complexities; in one case, array comparative genomic hybridization revealed 18 copy number changes. Breakpoint sequencing identified characteristic features, including small templated insertions at breakpoints and microhomology at breakpoint junctions, which have been attributed to replicative processes. The resemblance between CGR and chromothripsis suggests similar mechanistic underpinnings. Such chromosome catastrophic events appear to reflect basic DNA metabolism operative throughout an organism's life cycle."
https://openalex.org/W2171804530,"Synaptic plasticity in response to changes in physiologic state is coordinated by hormonal signals across multiple neuronal cell types. Here, we combine cell-type-specific electrophysiological, pharmacological, and optogenetic techniques to dissect neural circuits and molecular pathways controlling synaptic plasticity onto AGRP neurons, a population that regulates feeding. We find that food deprivation elevates excitatory synaptic input, which is mediated by a presynaptic positive feedback loop involving AMP-activated protein kinase. Potentiation of glutamate release was triggered by the orexigenic hormone ghrelin and exhibited hysteresis, persisting for hours after ghrelin removal. Persistent activity was reversed by the anorexigenic hormone leptin, and optogenetic photostimulation demonstrated involvement of opioid release from POMC neurons. Based on these experiments, we propose a memory storage device for physiological state constructed from bistable synapses that are flipped between two sustained activity states by transient exposure to hormones signaling energy levels."

https://openalex.org/W2080898127,"Systemic immunosuppression has been associated with stroke for many years, but the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. In this study, we demonstrated that stroke induced profound behavioral changes in hepatic invariant NKT (iNKT) cells in mice. Unexpectedly, these effects were mediated by a noradrenergic neurotransmitter rather than a CD1d ligand or other well-characterized danger signals. Blockade of this innervation was protective in wild-type mice after stroke but had no effect in mice deficient in iNKT cells. Selective immunomodulation of iNKT cells with a specific activator (α-galactosylceramide) promoted proinflammatory cytokine production and prevented infections after stroke. Our results therefore identify a molecular mechanism that leads to immunosuppression after stroke and suggest an attractive potential therapeutic alternative to antibiotics, namely, immunomodulation of iNKT cells to prevent stroke-associated infections."
https://openalex.org/W2102868331,"During germ cell and preimplantation development, mammalian cells undergo nearly complete reprogramming of DNA methylation patterns. We profiled the methylomes of human and chimp sperm as a basis for comparison to methylation patterns of ESCs. Although the majority of promoters escape methylation in both ESCs and sperm, the corresponding hypomethylated regions show substantial structural differences. Repeat elements are heavily methylated in both germ and somatic cells; however, retrotransposons from several subfamilies evade methylation more effectively during male germ cell development, whereas other subfamilies show the opposite trend. Comparing methylomes of human and chimp sperm revealed a subset of differentially methylated promoters and strikingly divergent methylation in retrotransposon subfamilies, with an evolutionary impact that is apparent in the underlying genomic sequence. Thus, the features that determine DNA methylation patterns differ between male germ cells and somatic cells, and elements of these features have diverged between humans and chimpanzees."
https://openalex.org/W2124221060,"The eukaryotic replicative DNA helicase, CMG, unwinds DNA by an unknown mechanism. In some models, CMG encircles and translocates along one strand of DNA while excluding the other strand. In others, CMG encircles and translocates along duplex DNA. To distinguish between these models, replisomes were confronted with strand-specific DNA roadblocks in Xenopus egg extracts. An ssDNA translocase should stall at an obstruction on the translocation strand but not the excluded strand, whereas a dsDNA translocase should stall at obstructions on either strand. We found that replisomes bypass large roadblocks on the lagging strand template much more readily than on the leading strand template. Our results indicate that CMG is a 3' to 5' ssDNA translocase, consistent with unwinding via ""steric exclusion."" Given that MCM2-7 encircles dsDNA in G1, the data imply that formation of CMG in S phase involves remodeling of MCM2-7 from a dsDNA to a ssDNA binding mode."

Therefore, specific AS events may modulate transcriptional networks involved in pluripotency maintenance versus cell-type specification. Forkhead box (FOX) transcription factors regulate a large number of genes involved in cell proliferation, differentiation, and development (Wijchers et al., 2006Wijchers P.J. Burbach J.P. Smidt M.P. In control of biology: of mice, men and Foxes.Biochem. J. 2006; 397: 233-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The forkhead box forms a winged helix domain of 80 to 100 amino acids that binds to DNA (Li et al., 2004Li S. Weidenfeld J. Morrisey E.E. Transcriptional and DNA binding activity of the Foxp1/2/4 family is modulated by heterotypic and homotypic protein interactions.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 809-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). FOXP1 is one of four FOXP subfamily members that contain a C-terminal forkhead domain together with N-terminal zinc finger and leucine zipper domains. FOXP1 is widely expressed, and its loss or fusion with other proteins through chromosomal translocations is associated with several cancers (Koon et al., 2007Koon H.B. Ippolito G.C. Banham A.H.

Several splice variants of FOXP1 have been identified (Brown et al., 2008Brown P.J. Ashe S.L. Leich E. Burek C. Barrans S. Fenton J.A. Jack A.S. Pulford K. Rosenwald A. Banham A.H.

In this study, we identify a highly conserved AS event in FOXP1 transcripts that is activated in ESCs and silenced during cell differentiation. This AS event modifies critical amino acid residues within the forkhead domain and alters its DNA-binding specificity. In ESCs this switches the transcriptional output of FOXP1 such that the pluripotency genes OCT4, NANOG, GDF3, and NR5A2 are stimulated, while genes involved in cell-lineage specification and differentiation are repressed. Induced expression of the ESC-specific isoform of FOXP1 promotes self-renewal and the maintenance of pluripotency, whereas its silencing inhibits iPSC programming. An evolutionarily conserved AS event thus reconfigures transcriptional regulatory networks required for transitions between ESC pluripotency maintenance and differentiation. To identify AS events that might control stem cell pluripotency, we used microarray profiling to compare patterns of AS in undifferentiated and differentiated H9 human (h)ESCs (Extended Experimental Procedures and Figure S1 available online). Whereas few AS changes were detected at day 2, ∼165 (2.85%) of the profiled exons were predicted to undergo inclusion level changes (Table S1 and data not shown) at day 10 following neural lineage induction. Genes containing these predicted AS changes were represented by diverse functional Gene Ontology (GO) categories. In this study, we focus on a previously unidentified AS change detected in transcripts from the FOXP1 gene. Our analysis indicated that FOXP1 exon 18 had increased inclusion in day 10 neural progenitor-enriched cells compared to undifferentiated H9 hESCs (∼96% versus 79% inclusion; Table S1). Reverse-transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assays confirmed this but also detected two unexpected additional bands that are ∼50 nt and ∼170 nt longer than the transcripts containing exon 18 (Figure 1A ). Sequencing of the +50 nt band revealed the inclusion in hESCs of a previously uncharacterized exon, which we refer to as exon 18b, in FOXP1 transcripts in place of exon 18, whereas the +170 nt band (asterisk in Figure 1) contained exons 18 and 18b. Consistent with low or undetectable (see below) expression of this isoform, inclusion of both exons introduces a termination codon 121 nt downstream of exon 18b that likely elicits nonsense-mediated mRNA decay. However, inclusion of exon 18b instead of exon 18 preserves the open reading frame but modifies the forkhead domain (see below, Figure S2A ).Figure S2Comparison of Human and Mouse FOXP1/Foxp1 Splice Variants, Related to Figure 1 and Figure 2Show full caption(A) Top: Schematic representation of human FOXP1 protein domains (encoded by the transcript NM_032682) shown relative to coding exon boundaries, and overview of human FOXP1 splice variants (updated from Brown et al., 2008Brown P.J.

(B) Table comparing length and sequence conservation between human FOXP1 exons 17 to 19 and the orthologous mouse Foxp1 exons 15 to 17. (C) RT-PCR analysis of Foxp1 alternative splicing in mES R1 self-renewing cells (lane 1), in R1 cells aggregated to form embryoid bodies (EBs) 5 days (lane 2) and 8 days (lane 3) post-induction of differentiation, in R1 cells differentiated into beating cardiomyocytes (day 13, lane 4), and in R1-derived neurospheres (lane 5). The positions of primers used for RT-PCR assays are indicated by black arrows. Gapdh mRNA levels are shown for comparison. Exon 18b is efficiently included in undifferentiated H9 hESCs (>64%, Figure 1B, lanes 1 and 2) and in H9 cells 2 days after differentiation induction (>58%, Figure 1B, lanes 3 to 5), relative to the neural lineage-enriched cell population at day 10 (11%, Figure 1B, lane 6). Consistent with this observation, a high proportion of H9 hESCs still expressed pluripotency markers at day 2 compared to day 10 post-induction of differentiation (Figure S1D). Next, we used RT-PCR to investigate exon 18 and 18b inclusion levels in another hESC line, CA1 (Figure 1B, lane7), and in a panel of partially or fully differentiated human cell lines (Figure 1B lanes 8–15; refer to legend). Similar to H9 hESCs, exon 18b was highly included in CA1 (62%), whereas exon 18 was the only exon detected in differentiated cell lines. Immunoblotting confirmed that FOXP1 protein containing exon 18b is more highly expressed in hESCs and is not expressed in differentiated cells (see below and Figure S4A). These results show that FOXP1 exon 18b switches from efficient inclusion in hESCs to almost complete skipping in differentiated cells. To further confirm that exon 18b is specifically included in self-renewing, pluripotent ESCs, we assessed exon 18b and 18 inclusion levels in H9 cells sorted for expression of the pluripotency markers TRA1-81 and SSEA-3 (Figure 1C). Partially differentiated H9 hESCs were used, such that reduced exon 18b inclusion was present (compare Figure 1C, lane 1 with lanes 1 and 2 in Figure 1B). However, in sorted cells expressing TRA1-81 and SSEA-3, exon 18b inclusion was high (Figure 1C, lane 3), whereas only minor levels of exon 18b inclusion were detected in the TRA1-81/SSEA-3-negative population (Figure 1C, lane 2). Thus, inclusion of FOXP1 exon 18b is specific to self-renewing, pluripotent hESCs. Hereafter we refer to the exon 18b splice variant as “FOXP1-ES” and the exon 18 variant as “FOXP1.” Comparison across species reveals that human FOXP1 exons 18 and 18b are located within an ∼1000 nt genomic region that is highly conserved (PhastCons mean 0.959, variance 0.029) in 46 vertebrates (Figure 1D). This region includes ∼120 nt upstream of exon 18, 373 nt between exons 18 and 18b, and ∼205 nt downstream of exon 18b. This observation suggests that exons 18 and 18b likely have conserved patterns of AS in diverse vertebrate species. To test this, we analyzed the regulation of the orthologous exons (exons 16 and 16b) in mouse Foxp1 transcripts (Figure 1D and Figure S2B). The AS levels of exons 16 and 16b were analyzed in three undifferentiated mouse (m)ESCs lines, CGR8, Hb9, and R1, and following induction into different lineages (Figure 1E and Figure S2C). Similar to human cells, exon 16b displayed the highest inclusion in undifferentiated mESCs (Figure 1E, lanes 1 and 7; Figure S2C, lane 1), and its inclusion level progressively decreased when CGR8- or R1-derived embryoid bodies (EBs) were induced to form cardiomyocytes over a 14 day period (Figure 1E, lanes 3 to 6; Figure S2C, lanes 2 to 4). Furthermore, exon 16b inclusion decreased in day 14 CGR8- or R1-derived neural and glial progenitor-enriched neurospheres (Figure 1E, lane 2; Figure S2C, lane 5), or when Hb9 mESCs were induced to form motor neuron (MN) precursors (Figure 1E, lane 8), and was almost entirely skipped in sorted, differentiated MNs and in the neuroblastoma cell line Neuro2A (Figure 1E, lanes 9 and 10). Similar to human exon 18, mouse exon 16 displayed inclusion in all of the samples but at reduced levels relative to exon 16b in undifferentiated mESCs. Consistent with the high sequence conservation associated with exons 18b/16b and 18/16 and the surrounding intronic regions, these exons thus display conserved patterns of regulation. The forkhead domain of human FOXP1 overlaps exons 16 to 19. FOXP forkhead domains are highly homologous and bind a canonical consensus motif GTAAACA as monomers and homo- and/or heterodimers (Koh et al., 2009Koh K.P. Sundrud M.S. Rao A.

Biol. 2004; 24: 809-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar), and a FOXP2-DNA (Stroud et al., 2006Stroud J.C. Wu Y. Bates D.L. Han A. Nowick K. Paabo S. Tong H. Chen L. Structure of the forkhead domain of FOXP2 bound to DNA.Structure. 2006; 14: 159-166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) costructure reveals that residues directly contacting DNA are conserved in FOXP1 (highlighted in green in Figure 2A ). Exon 18b is predicted to substitute 35 residues (highlighted in red in Figure 2A), none of which are predicted to alter secondary structure or dimerization (black dots show residues involved in dimerization in Figure 2A). However, of four residues that contact DNA in FOXP2, two (Asn510 and His514) are substituted in FOXP1-ES. These residues form critical hydrogen bonds with the adenine-thymine (A-T) base pair at the fourth position in the canonical FOXP site (underlined in GTAAACA), and their substitution may therefore affect binding affinity and/or specificity. We therefore investigated the DNA-binding properties of FOXP1 and FOXP1-ES using protein-binding microarrays (PBMs; Berger et al., 2006Berger M.F. Philippakis A.A. Qureshi A.M. He F.S. Estep 3rd, P.W. Bulyk M.L. Compact, universal DNA microarrays to comprehensively determine transcription-factor binding site specificities.Nat.

Chan E.T. et al.Variation in homeodomain DNA binding revealed by high-resolution analysis of sequence preferences.Cell. 2008; 133: 1266-1276Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). The PBM analysis revealed that FOXP1 and FOXP1-ES forkhead domains fused to glutathione S transferase (GST) preferentially recognize distinct DNA-binding motifs (Figure 2B and Figure S3A ). The canonical binding motif GTAAACAA was represented by the majority of the highest-scoring GST-FOXP1-bound sequences (blue dots), whereas GST-FOXP1-ES preferentially bound CGATACAA or closely related sequences (red dots). Other sequences preferentially bound by FOXP1-ES contained specific C/A-rich motifs (orange dots), whereas other C/A-rich motifs were bound by both proteins (green dots) (Figure 2B and Figure S3A). We confirmed these binding preferences by gel mobility shift assays (Figure 2C and Figure S3B). For example, GST-FOXP1-ES, when compared to GST-FOXP1, preferentially bound dsDNA probes containing AATAAACA and CGATACAA (orange and red dots in Figure 2B, respectively), whereas GST-FOXP1 preferentially bound the consensus GTAAACAA. Furthermore, GST-FOXP1 and GST-FOXP1-ES did not bind mutant versions of each of the analyzed PBM-derived binding sites (Figure 2C and Figure S3B; mutant positions underlined). These results show that hESC-specific inclusion of exon 18b changes the DNA-binding specificity of FOXP1. Moreover, consistent with the prediction that substitution of Asn510 and His514 in FOXP1-ES would affect recognition of the fourth A-T base pair in the consensus site, FOXP1-ES bound a T-A base pair at this position in a subset of the preferentially bound PBM sequences. Additional substitutions of conserved residues at the DNA-binding interface of FOXP1-ES presumably account for other changes in the DNA-binding properties of this splice isoform, including its preferential binding to specific C/A-rich motifs. Additionally, the results from the PBM experiments and gel mobility shift assays reveal that GST-FOXP1-ES binds a broader spectrum of sequences than does GST-FOXP1, although with apparent reduced affinity, as at similar concentration ranges GST-FOXP1-ES bound less efficiently to its high-scoring PBM sequences than did GST-FOXP1 (Figure 2 and Figure S3A). Collectively, these findings suggests that FOXP1-ES and FOXP1 direct different gene expression programs in ESCs. To investigate whether FOXP1 and FOXP1-ES control different sets of genes, we performed knockdowns using custom siRNA pools targeting either exon 18 or exon 18b in undifferentiated H9 cells, followed by RNA-Seq profiling. Relative to a control siRNA pool (Figure 3A , lane 1), each siRNA pool resulted in efficient (>80%) knockdown of only the expected FOXP1 isoform (RT-PCR in Figure 3A, lanes 2 and 3, and immunoblotting in Figure S4A , lanes 4 and 5). RNA-Seq reads from each sample were then mapped to RefSeq cDNAs to establish counts of unique-mapping reads per kb per million mapped reads (RPKM; Mortazavi et al., 2008Mortazavi A. Williams B.A. McCue K. Schaeffer L. Wold B. Mapping and quantifying mammalian transcriptomes by RNA-Seq.Nat. Methods. 2008; 5: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (9156) Google Scholar), and genes with at least 2-fold differences were further analyzed. Knockdown of FOXP1 caused changes in expression of 153 genes, whereas FOXP1-ES knockdown was more dramatic, resulting in altered expression of 472 genes, 76 of which overlapped with the FOXP1-dependent gene set (Figure 3B; Table S2 for a full analysis). Analysis by qRT-PCR of a representative set of 19 genes with predicted changes ranging from 2- to 20-fold agreed well with the RNA-Seq-derived estimates (r = 0.941; Figure S4B; see below). Of the affected genes, a significantly higher proportion showed increased expression upon FOXP1-ES knockdown versus FOXP1 (86% versus 58.2%; p = 1.63E-05, Chi-square test). Moreover, of the 76 genes affected in both knockdowns (Figure 3B), 61 (80.3%) displayed increased expression. These results suggest that in undifferentiated hESCs, FOXP1 and FOXP1-ES control distinct but overlapping sets of genes, with a substantially larger set of genes controlled by FOXP1-ES compared to FOXP1 in hESCs. Moreover, FOXP1-ES predominantly acts to suppress gene expression.Figure S4RNA-Seq Analysis of Transcript Level Changes in FOXP1 and FOXP1-ES Knockdowns, Related to Figure 3Show full caption(A) Western blot analysis of FOXP1 and FOXP1-ES levels in H9 hESCs following transfection with siRNA pools directed against exon 18 (lane 4) or exon 18b (lane 5), or with a control nontargeting siRNA pool (lane 3).

https://openalex.org/W1967973651,"The laboratory mouse has become the workhorse of biomedical research. The draft sequence of the mouse reference genome was published in 2002, but some forms of variation are still poorly documented. Two papers in this issue go a long way towards filling the gaps. The generation and analysis of sequence from 17 key mouse genomes, including most of the commonly used inbred strains and their progenitors, reveal extensive genetic variation and provide insights into the molecular nature of functional variants as well as the phylogenetic history of the lab mouse. The data will be an important resource for a new era of functional analysis. The second paper describes the landscape of structural variants in the genomes of 13 classical and four wild-derived inbred mouse strains, mapping many of them to base-pair resolution. Despite their prevalence, structural variants are shown to have a relatively small impact on phenotypic variation. Structural variation is widespread in mammalian genomes1,2 and is an important cause of disease3, but just how abundant and important structural variants (SVs) are in shaping phenotypic variation remains unclear4,5. Without knowing how many SVs there are, and how they arise, it is difficult to discover what they do. Combining experimental with automated analyses, we identified 711,920 SVs at 281,243 sites in the genomes of thirteen classical and four wild-derived inbred mouse strains. The majority of SVs are less than 1 kilobase in size and 98% are deletions or insertions. The breakpoints of 160,000 SVs were mapped to base pair resolution, allowing us to infer that insertion of retrotransposons causes more than half of SVs. Yet, despite their prevalence, SVs are less likely than other sequence variants to cause gene expression or quantitative phenotypic variation. We identified 24 SVs that disrupt coding exons, acting as rare variants of large effect on gene function. One-third of the genes so affected have immunological functions."
https://openalex.org/W2045339936,"A primary consequence of plate tectonics is that basaltic oceanic crust subducts with lithospheric slabs into the mantle. Seismological studies extend this process to the lower mantle, and geochemical observations indicate return of oceanic crust to the upper mantle in plumes. There has been no direct petrologic evidence, however, of the return of subducted oceanic crustal components from the lower mantle. We analyzed superdeep diamonds from Juina-5 kimberlite, Brazil, which host inclusions with compositions comprising the entire phase assemblage expected to crystallize from basalt under lower-mantle conditions. The inclusion mineralogies require exhumation from the lower to upper mantle. Because the diamond hosts have carbon isotope signatures consistent with surface-derived carbon, we conclude that the deep carbon cycle extends into the lower mantle."
https://openalex.org/W2004840945,"NF-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) is an important transcription factor that activates the expression of cellular detoxifying enzymes. Nrf2 expression is largely regulated through the association of Nrf2 with Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1), which results in cytoplasmic Nrf2 degradation. Conversely, little is known concerning the regulation of Keap1 expression. Until now, a regulatory role for microRNAs (miRs) in controlling Keap1 gene expression had not been characterized. By using miR array-based screening, we observed miR-200a silencing in breast cancer cells and demonstrated that upon re-expression, miR-200a targets the Keap1 3′-untranslated region (3′-UTR), leading to Keap1 mRNA degradation. Loss of this regulatory mechanism may contribute to the dysregulation of Nrf2 activity in breast cancer. Previously, we have identified epigenetic repression of miR-200a in breast cancer cells. Here, we find that treatment with epigenetic therapy, the histone deacetylase inhibitor suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid, restored miR-200a expression and reduced Keap1 levels. This reduction in Keap1 levels corresponded with Nrf2 nuclear translocation and activation of Nrf2-dependent NAD(P)H-quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1) gene transcription. Moreover, we found that Nrf2 activation inhibited the anchorage-independent growth of breast cancer cells. Finally, our in vitro observations were confirmed in a model of carcinogen-induced mammary hyperplasia in vivo. In conclusion, our study demonstrates that miR-200a regulates the Keap1/Nrf2 pathway in mammary epithelium, and we find that epigenetic therapy can restore miR-200a regulation of Keap1 expression, therefore reactivating the Nrf2-dependent antioxidant pathway in breast cancer.

Nrf2 regulates the expression of numerous detoxifying enzymes, including glutathione S-transferases (GSTs), γ-glutamylcysteine synthetase, NQO1 (NAD(P)H-quinone oxidoreductase 1), and glucuronosyl transferases, thus protecting against carcinogen-induced DNA damage (3Fields W.R. Morrow C.S. Doehmer J. Townsend A.J. Carcinogenesis. 1999; 20: 1121-1125Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Functional activity of Nrf2 strongly depends on its regulation by the Keap1 (Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1) adaptor protein. Keap1 binds to and sequesters Nrf2 in the cytoplasm, thus leading to Nrf2 ubiquitination by Cul3 and proteasomal degradation (4Dinkova-Kostova A.T. Holtzclaw W.D. Cole R.N. Itoh K. Wakabayashi N.

Due to its role in protecting against genotoxic stress, it has been hypothesized that Nrf2 could be a target for chemopreventative strategies. Nrf2 is found down-regulated in breast cancer cell lines and breast cancer patient samples when compared to healthy mammary epithelial cells (9Loignon M. Miao W. Hu L. Bier A. Bismar T.A. Scrivens P.J. Mann K. Basik M. Bouchard A. Fiset P.O. Batist Z. Batist G. Mol. Cancer Ther. 2009; 8: 2432-2440Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). However, Nrf2 is not down-regulated in all cancers. For example, in lung and pancreatic cancers, mutation of Keap1 disrupts Keap1/Nrf2 interaction, leading to constitutive activation of Nrf2 (10Singh A. Misra V. Thimmulappa R.K. Lee H. Ames S.

In these cancers, it is thought that hijacking of detoxifying pathways, through constitutive hyperactivation of Nrf2, promotes resistance to chemotherapy. Nevertheless, in support of a protective role for Nrf2, several studies have found that Nrf2-deficient mouse models show increased carcinogen sensitivity and cancer incidence (12Ramos-Gomez M.

Furthermore, other studies suggest additional roles for Nrf2 in opposing tumorigenesis. Nrf2 knockdown in lung cancer cells has been shown to result in loss of E-cadherin and increased cell motility (16Rachakonda G. Sekhar K.R. Jowhar D. Samson P.C. Wikswo J.P. Beauchamp R.D. Datta P.K. Freeman M.L. Oncogene. 2010; 29: 3703-3714Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Similarly, the activation of the Nrf2 pathway in renal tubular epithelial cells (undergoing immunosuppressive induction) has been shown to prevent epithelial to mesenchymal transition by maintaining E-cadherin expression (17Shin D.H. Park H.M. Jung K.A. Choi H.G. Kim J.A. Kim D.D. Kim S.G. Kang K.W. Ku S.K. Kensler T.W. Kwak M.K. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2010; 48: 1051-1063Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Finally, it was found that knockdown of Nrf2 can facilitate hepatocellular carcinoma and hepatocellular adenocarcinoma cell migration by activating transforming growth factor β (TGF-β)/Smad signaling pathways (16Rachakonda G. Sekhar K.R. Jowhar D. Samson P.C. Wikswo J.P. Beauchamp R.D. Datta P.K. Freeman M.L. Oncogene. 2010; 29: 3703-3714Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Thus, in addition to protecting against genotoxicity, Nrf2 may oppose tumorigenesis by suppressing tumor cell invasion. Regardless, the exact role of Nrf2 in tumorigenesis is likely to be cancer-specific and stage-specific. In addition to somatic mutation, other mechanisms have been found that impact Keap1 expression in cancers. It was shown that CpG methylation of the Keap1 promoter can affect Keap1 expression in gliomas (19Muscarella L.A. Barbano R. D'Angelo V. Copetti M. Coco M. Balsamo T. la Torre A. Notarangelo A.

Additionally, aberrant mRNA splicing has been found to impact Keap1 expression in prostate cancer (20Zhang P. Singh A. Yegnasubramanian S. Esopi D. Kombairaju P. Bodas M. Wu H. Bova S.G. Biswal S. Mol. Cancer Ther. 2010; 9: 336-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). Due to a limited understanding of Keap1 regulation in breast cancers, we sought to determine what if any role miRs play in the regulation of the Keap1/Nrf2 pathway in breast cancer cells. Of particular importance to our studies, there has been no previous characterization of Keap1 regulation by miRs. miRs are ∼22-nucleotide single-stranded non-coding RNAs that suppress gene expression post-transcriptionally by binding to miR response elements within 3′-UTRs of target mRNAs. miR regulation results in inhibition of target gene expression through mRNA degradation and/or translational inhibition (21Filipowicz W.

Aberrant expression of miRs is closely associated with various human diseases, including breast cancer (23O'Day E. Lal A.

The miR-200 family has been found to play a critical role in the maintenance of the epithelial phenotype by targeting ZEB1, SIP1, and SIRT1, thus preventing the silencing of E-cadherin (30Eades G.

Within the miR-200 family, there are two clusters: miR-200b/200a/429 located on chromosome 1p36, and miR-200c/141 located on chromosome 12p13 (32Uhlmann S. Zhang J.D. Schwäger A. Mannsperger H.

SAHA (vorinostat) is an HDAC inhibitor that targets Class I/II HDACs that is being evaluated in multiple clinical trials for treatment of advanced solid tumors and hematological malignancies and is currently approved for the treatment of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. HDAC inhibitors, such as SAHA, function by increasing histone (and non-histone) acetylation, which can lead to re-expression of epigenetically silenced genes (33Sarkar S. Abujamra A.L. Loew J.E. Forman L.W. Perrine S.P. Faller D.V. Anticancer Res. 2011; 31: 2723-2732PubMed Google Scholar, 34Santini V. Gozzini A. Ferrari G. Curr. Drug Metab. 2007; 8: 383-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). It has recently been demonstrated that treatment of breast cancer cell lines with histone deacetylase inhibitors can result in the re-expression of epigenetically silenced miRs (28Vrba L. Jensen T.J.

It was previously demonstrated that epigenetic mechanisms played a key role in miR-200a loss in breast cancer. We now demonstrate that epigenetic silencing of miR-200a contributes to dysregulation of Keap1 and interferes with the Keap1/Nrf2 pathway. Treatment of breast cancer cell lines with epigenetic therapy (SAHA) resulted in miR-200a restoration and Keap1 down-regulation, which ultimately led to reactivation of the Nrf2-dependent antioxidant pathways. Human breast cancer cell lines MDA-MB-231 and Hs578T and human embryonic kidney cell line 293T (HEK293T) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; HyClone, Rockford, IL) and 1% l-glutamine (Invitrogen). Human mammary epithelial cell line MCF-10A was maintained in DMEM/F-12 medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10 μg/ml insulin (Sigma), 100 ng/ml cholera toxin (Sigma), 0.5 μg/ml hydrocortisone (Sigma), 20 ng/ml EGF (Invitrogen), and 5% horse serum (Invitrogen). Cells were incubated in an atmosphere containing 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Reagents used in this study include 17-β-estradiol (E2) (Sigma), which was dissolved in ethanol, as well as vorinostat (SAHA) (BioVision, Inc., Mountain View, CA) and actinomycin D (Act D) (Sigma), which were dissolved in DMSO. Total RNA from cell lines was extracted for analysis as previously described (30Eades G. Yao Y. Yang M. Zhang Y. Chumsri S. Zhou Q. J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 25992-26002Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar, 35Yang M. Yao Y. Eades G. Zhang Y. Zhou Q. Breast Cancer Res. Treat. 2011; 129: 983-991Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Briefly, total RNA was extracted with TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). cDNA was synthesized from 1 μg of total RNA using Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). Total RNA from mouse mammary gland tissue was isolated with the RNeasy Lipid Tissue Midi Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) following manufacturer's instructions. Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) was carried out using a Light Cycler 480II (Roche Applied Science) with primers for Keap1 (forward, 5′-TACGATGTGGAAACAGAGACGTGGA-3′; reverse, 5′-TCAACAGGTACAGTTCTGGTCAATCT-3′) and NQO1 (forward, 5′-AGGCTGGTTTGAGCGAGTTC-3′; reverse, 5′-ATTGAATTCGGGCGTCTGCTG-3′). mRNA levels were normalized to levels of GAPDH mRNA as before (30Eades G. Yao Y. Yang M. Zhang Y. Chumsri S. Zhou Q. J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 25992-26002Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). In addition, small RNA was converted to cDNA from 1 μg of total RNA using the First-Strand Synthesis Kit (SABiosciences, Frederick, MD). Follow-up miR analysis was performed by qRT-PCR using miR-specific (miR-200a) primer sets (SABiosciences) with normalization to U6 snRNA levels as an internal control. miR expression was screened for an 88-miR panel using the Human miFinder Array (SABioscience). pLenti4.1EX-miR-200 cluster expression vector, which encodes miR-200a, was a generous gift from Dr. Gregory J. Goodall (36Gregory P.A. Bert A.G. Paterson E.L. Barry S.C. Tsykin A. Farshid G. Vadas M.A. Khew-Goodall Y. Goodall G.J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2008; 10: 593-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (3172) Google Scholar). Synthetic antagomiR-200a was obtained from Ambion (Austin, TX). The 3′-UTR of Keap1 was amplified using the primers 5′-ACGTACGCTAGCGAAGCAGATTGACCAGCAGA-3′ and 5′-ACGTACCTCGAGATGCGATGGGCAAAGATTAC-3′ and cloned into pSGG vector digested with NheI and XhoI. The reporter plasmid obtained was then used as template to generate a mutant miR response element for miR-200a using the Generate site-directed mutagenesis system (Invitrogen) and primers 5′-GAAGGGAGGCCAGGATGCCTGACTCTTAAAATGACATCTCAAAAGA-3′ and 5′-TCTTTTGAGATGTCATTTTAAGAGTCAGGCATCCTGGCCTCCCTTC-3′. The resulting mutant contains three point mutations GGATGCCT(C to G)A(G to C)T(G to C)TTAAAATGAC as confirmed by sequencing. NQO1-ARE luciferase plasmid contains the NQO1 promoter, including the ARE region. Cells were transfected with miR-200a expression vector, Nrf2-myc (37Furukawa M. Xiong Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 162-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar) expression plasmids, antagomiR-200a, empty vector control plasmids, or scramble antagomiR controls using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Luciferase assays were performed as described previously (30Eades G. Yao Y. Yang M. Zhang Y. Chumsri S. Zhou Q. J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 25992-26002Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar, 38Yao Y. Li H. Gu Y. Davidson N.E. Zhou Q. Carcinogenesis. 2010; 31: 382-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Cells were transfected with luciferase reporter plasmids along with Renilla luciferase phGR-TK (Promega, Madison, WI) as an internal control using Lipofectamine 2000. The luciferase activity was measured 48 h after transfection using the Dual-Luciferase reporter assay system (Promega). Keap1 mRNA stability assays were performed as previously described (35Yang M. Yao Y. Eades G. Zhang Y. Zhou Q. Breast Cancer Res. Treat. 2011; 129: 983-991Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were transfected with miR-200a expression vector or empty control vector. 48 h after transfection, cells were incubated with Act D (5 μg/ml) and harvested at subsequent time intervals (0, 1, 2, and 4 h). Total RNA was extracted, and cDNA was synthesized as described above. qRT-PCR analysis was used to monitor Keap1 mRNA decay. Housekeeping gene GAPDH, which shows little to no decay over 4 h, was used as an internal control. Results from Act D assays were processed using Prism 4.0 software (GraphPad, La Jolla, CA) to calculate Keap1 mRNA half-life. Western blotting was performed using anti-Keap1 (E-20, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) goat polyclonal antibody and anti-Nrf2 rabbit polyclonal antibody (H-300, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.). Nuclear extraction was performed using the ProteoJETTM cytoplasmic and nuclear protein extraction kit (Fermentas, Glen Burnie, MD). Anti-proliferating cell nuclear antigen rabbit polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) was used as a nuclear marker and a loading control. Actin antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) was used to normalize protein expression. The ChIP assay was carried out as described previously (30Eades G. Yao Y. Yang M. Zhang Y. Chumsri S. Zhou Q. J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 25992-26002Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar, 38Yao Y. Li H. Gu Y. Davidson N.E. Zhou Q. Carcinogenesis. 2010; 31: 382-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were cross-linked with 1% formaldehyde followed by sonication. Soluble chromatin was collected and incubated with antibodies against Nrf2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) overnight at 4 °C for immunoprecipitation. Rabbit IgG was used as negative control. The recovered DNA was then analyzed by qRT-PCR using primers flanking the ARE of the human NQO1 promoter (39Yao Y. Brodie A.M. Davidson N.E. Kensler T.W. Zhou Q. Breast Cancer Res. Treat. 2010; 124: 585-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Results were normalized to input controls. The soft agar assay was performed in 6-well plates (in duplicate) as described previously (35Yang M. Yao Y. Eades G. Zhang Y. Zhou Q. Breast Cancer Res. Treat. 2011; 129: 983-991Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Each well consisted of a bottom base layer (0.6% agarose diluted in DMEM) (Bio-Rad) and top layer (0.3% agarose diluted in DMEM) containing 5 × 104 cells. We added a few drops of DMEM to the solidified top layer. The top layer was replenished on a weekly basis. After 3 weeks, cells were stained with 0.05% crystal violet overnight at 37 °C. Colonies were visualized and counted with light microscopy. Colonies larger than 50 μm in diameter were counted from four random 4× objective fields. Adult female C57BL6 mice were obtained from the Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME) and were housed under controlled temperature, humidity, and lighting conditions. The animals were maintained in facilities approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Four treatment groups were included in the study: 1) an E2-treated group, which was treated with 20 mg/kg E2 for 28 days by mammary fat pad injection; 2) an E2 and SAHA-co-treated group, which was treated with 20 mg/kg E2 for 28 days by mammary fat pad injection and with 50 mg/kg SAHA by oral treatment for days 14–28; 3) a control group, which was injected with ethanol in the fat pad for 28 days; and 4) a control group treated only with SAHA (50 mg/kg) on days 14–28. Formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded mammary gland tissue sections were prepared for immunohistochemistry staining as described previously (30Eades G. Yao Y. Yang M. Zhang Y. Chumsri S. Zhou Q. J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 25992-26002Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Animals from each treatment group were examined. Polyclonal rabbit anti-Ki67 (H-300, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), polyclonal goat anti-Keap1 antibody (E-20, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), and polyclonal rabbit anti-Nrf2 antibody (H-300, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) were applied and followed by a biotin-conjugated donkey anti-goat or goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.). An avidin-biotin peroxidase substrate kit (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) was used to develop brown precipitate. Hematoxylin was utilized for staining of nuclei. For quantitative analysis, we calculated the percentage of positively stained mammary epithelial cells. Statistical analysis was performed using Student's t test, and p values of <0.01 were considered significant. Data were represented as mean ± S.D. GraphPad Prism 4.0 software was used for all data analysis. We began our studies interested in probing possible regulation of the Keap1/Nrf2 pathway by miR networks in mammary epithelium. Previously, Nrf2 has been found down-regulated in multiple breast cancer cell lines and patient samples (9Loignon M. Miao W. Hu L. Bier A. Bismar T.A. Scrivens P.J. Mann K. Basik M. Bouchard A. Fiset P.O. Batist Z. Batist G. Mol. Cancer Ther. 2009; 8: 2432-2440Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). To determine if miRs might play some role in the dysregulation of the Keap1/Nrf2 pathway, we first examined the expression profile of 88 highly characterized miRs in metastatic breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231 compared with that of the MCF-10A non-tumorigenic mammary epithelial cell line. Fig. 1A shows that the results of our expression profiling revealed up- or down-regulation of 18 miRs by 4-fold or greater in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. Among these 18 miRs were two members examined from the miR-200 family (miR-141 and miR-200c; chromosome 12), which were found to be the most significantly down-regulated miRs (miR-141 >800-fold, miR-200c >400-fold) examined with this array. Importantly, when exploring the TargetScan5.1 miR target prediction algorithm, miR-141 was predicted to target a conserved site within the Keap1 3′-UTR. In fact, only one conserved targeting site was identified within the Keap1 3′-UTR, a site matching the seed sequences for miR-200a and miR-141 (which share identical seed sequences) (Fig. 1C). Based on the predicted targeting information and our array data, we further examined dysregulation of the miR-200 family by examining miR-200a (chromosome 1) expression by qRT-PCR. We found that miR-200a levels were also significantly decreased in breast cancer cell lines MDA-MB-231 and Hs578T (invasive, triple-negative breast cancer cell line) compared with non-tumorigenic MCF-10A cells (Fig. 1B, p < 0.01). In order to test whether miR-200a could regulate the predicted target site within the Keap1 mRNA 3′-UTR, we performed luciferase reporter assays by cloning the 3′-UTR of Keap1 into luciferase reporter constructs. We also constructed mutant luciferase reporters by mutating 3 bases of the predicted miR-200a target seeding site ((T(C to G)A(G to C)T(G to C)TT) with PCR-based mutagenesis to disrupt miR-200a targeting. We examined reporter activity in HEK293T cells, which do not express detectable levels of miR-200a (data not shown). HEK293T cells were co-transfected with wild type or mutant pSGG Keap1 3′-UTR luciferase vectors (along with phGR-TK Renilla luciferase vectors for normalization) in addition to miR-200a expression vector or empty vector control. Co-transfection of miR-200a expression vector was found to decrease wild type Keap1 3′-UTR reporter activity by 85% (p < 0.01) compared with transfection of empty vector controls (Fig. 1C). However, co-transfection of miR-200a expression vector did not significantly alter mutant Keap1 3′-UTR reporter activity (p > 0.05) (Fig. 1C). This result provides validation that miR-200a targets the predicted site within the 3′-UTR of Keap1 mRNA. We next examined the impact of miR-200a overexpression on endogenous Keap1 expression in breast cancer cell lines. In both MDA-MB-231 and Hs578T cell lines, transfection of miR-200a expression vector significantly reduced Keap1 mRNA levels (>4-fold and >400-fold, respectively) (Fig. 1D, p < 0.01) compared with transfection of empty vector controls. Subsequently, we further probed miR-200a regulation of Keap1 mRNA by performing mRNA stability assays. MDA-MB-231 and Hs578T cells were transfected with miR-200a expression vector or empty vector control and treated with the transcriptional inhibitor Act D, after which RNA from the cells was harvested at various time points and examined by qRT-PCR (40Zhou H. Mazan-Mamczarz K. Martindale J.L. Barker A. Liu Z. Gorospe M. Leedman P.J. Gartenhaus R.B. Hamburger A.W. Zhang Y. Nucleic Acids Res. 2010; 38: 3619-3631Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Using Prism 4.0 software, we calculated the half-life (t½) of Keap1 mRNA in empty vector control-transfected MDA-MB-231 and Hs578T cells to be 1.5 and 1 h, respectively. After transfection of miR-200a expression vector, we observed a decrease in Keap1 mRNA half-life in MDA-MB-231 and Hs578T cells to 0.7 and 0.4 h, respectively (Fig. 2A). Next, we confirmed that miR-200a targeting of Keap1 mRNA also resulted in decreased Keap1 protein levels by Western blotting (Fig. 2B). Collectively, these results demonstrate that miR-200a targets the 3′-UTR of Keap1 mRNA, resulting in destabilization of Keap1 mRNA and a corresponding decrease in Keap1 protein levels. This establishes miR-200a as a potentially important regulator of Keap1 expression and, hence, the Keap1/Nrf2 pathway. In order to confirm if miR-200a regulation of Keap1 impacts Nrf2, we transfected breast cancer cell lines (MDA-MB-231 and Hs578T) with miR-200a expression vector and examined Nrf2 expression in whole-cell lysates and nuclear extracts with Western blotting. Upon overexpression of miR-200a, we found an increase in Nrf2 expression in both whole cell lysates (total Nrf2) and nuclear extract (nuc"

In this model, odor representations can only be afforded behavioral significance upon experience. We have devised an experimental strategy that permits us to ask whether the activation of an arbitrarily chosen subpopulation of neurons in piriform cortex can elicit different behavioral responses dependent upon learning. Activation of a small subpopulation of piriform neurons expressing channelrhodopsin at multiple loci in the piriform cortex, when paired with reward or shock, elicits either appetitive or aversive behavior. Moreover, we demonstrate that different subpopulations of piriform neurons expressing ChR2 can be discriminated and independently entrained to elicit distinct behaviors. These observations demonstrate that the piriform cortex is sufficient to elicit learned behavioral outputs in the absence of sensory input. These data imply that the piriform does not use spatial order to map odorant identity or behavioral output."

Perini G. Green M.R. Expressing the human genome.Nature. 2001; 409: 832-833Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar) and are essential regulators of development and differentiation through binding DNA elements termed E boxes (Massari and Murre, 2000Massari M.E. Murre C. Helix-loop-helix proteins: regulators of transcription in eucaryotic organisms.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 429-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (1299) Google Scholar). Class I bHLH homodimers are expressed broadly and promote expression of antiproliferative genes such as CDKN1A, CDKN2A, and CDKN2B (Yokota and Mori, 2002Yokota Y. Mori S. Role of Id family proteins in growth control.J. Cell. Physiol. 2002; 190: 21-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Class II bHLH proteins show more restricted expression and form heterodimers with class I proteins to drive tissue-specific genes such as [email protected] and SP7/OSTERIX (Lassar et al., 1991Lassar A.B. Davis R.L. Wright W.E. Kadesch T. Murre C. Voronova A. Baltimore D. Weintraub H.

Genetta T. Kadesch T. Tissue-specific gene activation by MyoD: determination of specificity by cis-acting repression elements.Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2203-2211Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Through the combined induction of tissue-specific and antiproliferative genes, bHLH transcription factors serve as integrators of lineage commitment. DNA binding of bHLH proteins is limited by heterodimerization with inhibitor of DNA-binding proteins, or IDs. The ID family consists of four members, ID1, ID2, ID3, and ID4 (Lasorella et al., 2001Lasorella A. Uo T. Iavarone A. Id proteins at the cross-road of development and cancer.Oncogene. 2001; 20: 8326-8333Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), with overlapping spatial and temporal expression profiles. All four IDs bind the various bHLH proteins with similar affinities to regulate gene expression (Prabhu et al., 1997Prabhu S. Ignatova A. Park S.T. Sun X.H. Regulation of the expression of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21 by E2A and Id proteins.Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5888-5896Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). IDs are essential for mammalian development; disruption of two or more ID genes results in embryonic lethality (Lyden et al., 1999Lyden D. Young A.Z. Zagzag D. Yan W. Gerald W. O'Reilly R. Bader B.L. Hynes R.O. Zhuang Y. Manova K. Benezra R. Id1 and Id3 are required for neurogenesis, angiogenesis and vascularization of tumour xenografts.Nature. 1999; 401: 670-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (753) Google Scholar). In contrast, overexpression of ID proteins in transgenic mice produces fatal malignancies (Kim et al., 1999Kim D. Peng X.C. Sun X.H. Massive apoptosis of thymocytes in T-cell-deficient Id1 transgenic mice.Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8240-8253Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Similarly, elevated ID protein levels are observed in a broad range of dedifferentiated primary human malignancies ranging from pancreatic carcinoma to neuroblastoma (Perk et al., 2005Perk J. Iavarone A. Benezra R. Id family of helix-loop-helix proteins in cancer.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2005; 5: 603-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). Although ID proteins are scarce in normal adult differentiated tissues, they are abundant in proliferating tissues, including embryonic and adult stem cell populations, which suggests that IDs might maintain “stemness” (Yokota and Mori, 2002Yokota Y. Mori S. Role of Id family proteins in growth control.J. Cell. Physiol. 2002; 190: 21-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). The stem cell expression and tumor-promoting qualities of ID proteins suggest that ID genes may be pivotal in cancer stem cell biology. An engineered ID-suppressing HLH protein was reported to differentiate neuroblastoma tumors (Ciarapica et al., 2009Ciarapica R. Annibali D. Raimondi L. Savino M. Nasi S. Rota R. Targeting Id protein interactions by an engineered HLH domain induces human neuroblastoma cell differentiation.Oncogene. 2009; 28: 1881-1891Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). IDs are induced transcriptionally by myriad growth factors including bone morphogenic proteins, platelet-derived growth factor, epidermal growth factor, as well as by T cell receptor ligation (Yokota and Mori, 2002Yokota Y. Mori S. Role of Id family proteins in growth control.J. Cell. Physiol. 2002; 190: 21-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). ID1, ID2, and ID3, but not ID4, are subject to K48-linked polyubiquitination and subsequent degradation by the 26S proteasome. Consequently, IDs are short lived in most tissues (Bounpheng et al., 1999Bounpheng M.A. Dimas J.J. Dodds S.G. Christy B.A. Degradation of Id proteins by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway.FASEB J. 1999; 13: 2257-2264Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The ubiquitously expressed APC/Cdh1 complex is an E3 ubiquitin ligase that governs ID stability and abundance (Lasorella et al., 2006Lasorella A. Stegmüller J. Guardavaccaro D. Liu G. Carro M.S. Rothschild G. de la Torre-Ubieta L. Pagano M. Bonni A. Iavarone A. Degradation of Id2 by the anaphase-promoting complex couples cell cycle exit and axonal growth.Nature. 2006; 442: 471-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar), but ID proteins are stable in some contexts. Therefore, we sought a deubiquitinating enzyme that counters ID ubiquitination. We show that USP1 deubiquitinates and stabilizes ID1, ID2, and ID3, resulting in their increased abundance. Significantly, elevated USP1 protein and mRNA in a subset of primary osteosarcoma tumors correlated with increased ID protein levels. USP1 knockdown in osteosarcoma cells caused ID protein destabilization, p53-independent induction of CDKN1A encoding cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor (CDKI) p21, and cell-cycle arrest. In addition, expression of mesenchymal stem cell markers was decreased and osteogenic differentiation resumed. These data suggest that osteosarcomas, like acute promyelocytic leukemia, may be amenable to differentiation therapies (Soignet et al., 1998Soignet S.L. Maslak P. Wang Z.G. Jhanwar S. Calleja E. Dardashti L.J. Corso D. DeBlasio A. Gabrilove J. Scheinberg D.A. et al.Complete remission after treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia with arsenic trioxide.N. Engl. J. Med. 1998; 339: 1341-1348Crossref PubMed Scopus (1071) Google Scholar). In contrast to USP1 knockdown, USP1 overexpression in primary human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) caused ID protein accumulation and interfered with normal differentiation. Indeed, USP1 promoted transformation in a mesenchymal cell line. Finally, loss of Usp1 in gene-targeted mice caused severe osteopenia, which is consistent with a role for USP1 in the mesenchymal lineage. Our results strongly suggest that USP1 has oncogenic potential and promotes tumorigenesis through disruption of normal mesenchymal stem cell commitment and differentiation. To identify deubiquitinases (DUBs) that stabilize ID proteins, we overexpressed 94 human DUBs with C-terminal Flag epitopes in 293T cells and assessed endogenous ID2 abundance by western blot (see Table S1 available online). 293T cells degrade ID2 in a proteasome-dependent manner because ID2 accumulates after treatment with the proteasome inhibitor MG-132 (Figure S1A ). DUBs that increased endogenous ID2 were USP36, JOSD2, USP33, SENP3, SENP5, USP37, OTUD5, USP9Y, USP45, and USP1 (Figure S1A). To exclude indirect mechanisms increasing ID2 expression, we focused on ID2-interacting DUBs USP1 and USP33 (Figure S1B). However, unlike USP1, USP33 lacked deubiquitinating activity against ID2 (data not shown). To determine whether USP1 extended the half-life of ID2, we transfected 293T cells with USP1 and monitored ID2 abundance after treatment with the translational inhibitor cycloheximide. In the absence of new protein synthesis, ID2 was cleared rapidly from cells transfected with a control vector, with a half-life of approximately 2 min (Figure 1A ). Overexpressed USP1 extended the half-life of ID2 to over 80 min. The proteolytic activity of USP1 was necessary for ID2 accumulation because the catalytically inactive point mutant USP1 C90S (Nijman et al., 2005Nijman S.M. Huang T.T. Dirac A.M. Brummelkamp T.R. Kerkhoven R.M. D'Andrea A.D. Bernards R. The deubiquitinating enzyme USP1 regulates the Fanconi anemia pathway.Mol. Cell. 2005; 17: 331-339Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar) neither increased the half-life of ID2 (Figure 1A) nor altered ID2 steady-state abundance (Figure 1B). Similar results were obtained with ID1 and ID3. USP1 appeared to target IDs specifically because it did not enhance expression of labile IκBα (Palombella et al., 1994Palombella V.J. Rando O.J. Goldberg A.L. Maniatis T. The ubiquitin-proteasome pathway is required for processing the NF-kappa B1 precursor protein and the activation of NF-kappa B.Cell. 1994; 78: 773-785Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1877) Google Scholar). Next, we assessed the effect of USP1 on ID2 ubiquitination. Wild-type USP1, but not USP1 C90S, reduced the amount of ID2 modified with HA-tagged ubiquitin (Figure 1C). Both basal and USP1-induced ID2 deubiquitination was enhanced by coexpression of USP1 cofactor WDR48 (Cohn et al., 2007Cohn M.A. Kowal P. Yang K. Haas W. Huang T.T. Gygi S.P. D'Andrea A.D. A UAF1-containing multisubunit protein complex regulates the Fanconi anemia pathway.Mol. Cell. 2007; 28: 786-797Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar) (Figure 1C). To address whether USP1 deubiquitinated ID2 directly, ubiquitinated ID2 purified from 293T cells was incubated in vitro with either wild-type USP1 or USP1 C90S purified separately from 293T cells. Ubiquitinated ID2 was decreased by wild-type USP1 but not USP1 C90S (Figure 1D), indicating that deubiquitination was unlikely a consequence of a coeluted protease. The decrease in ID2 ubiquitination also was sensitive to N-ethylmaleimide, confirming the involvement of a cysteine protease (Figure 1D). Consistent with ubiquitinated ID2 being a USP1 substrate, deletion mutant USP1Δ260–300 interacted poorly with ID2 (Figure S1C) and did not enhance ID2 abundance (Figure S1D). To identify a biological context in which USP1 deubiquitinates ID proteins, we examined USP1 expression patterns. Microarray analyses of healthy and diseased human tissues revealed that osteosarcoma tumors expressed more USP1 mRNA than healthy or osteoarthritic bone biopsies (Figure 2A ). Western blotting of a separate set of primary human osteosarcoma biopsies found that USP1 was elevated in 7 of 14 osteosarcomas when compared to 3 normal primary human osteoblast samples (Figure 2B). Strikingly, ID2 protein abundance in these primary human tumor samples correlated well with USP1 abundance. One anomalous sample contained abundant USP1 but little ID2 (Figure 2B, lane 6), perhaps due to poor expression of the USP1 cofactor WDR48. Another sample contained abundant ID2 and little USP1 (Figure 2B, lane 16), which may reflect reduced ID2 ubiquitination or that other DUBs are active. The amount of USP1 protein in the primary osteosarcomas correlated largely with USP1 mRNA abundance (Figure 2C), suggesting that elevated USP1 in osteosarcoma is due to transcriptional upregulation. In contrast, ID2 protein and mRNA levels correlated poorly (Figure 2D). The coincident overexpression of USP1 and ID2 in primary osteosarcoma was confirmed by immunohistochemistry (Figures 2E–2G). These results strongly suggest that USP1 modifies ID proteins posttranslationally in osteosarcoma. We also assessed USP1 abundance and ID2 stability in human osteosarcoma cell lines and in primary osteoblasts (Figure S2A ). In U2-OS osteosarcoma cells, USP1 was elevated, and the normally labile ID2 was stable (Figures S2A and S2B). Knockdown of USP1 with two distinct USP1 shRNAs caused a reduction in ID1, ID2, and ID3 but had no effect on ID4 (Figure 3A ). ID1, ID2, and ID3 mRNAs were not reduced, excluding decreased transcription as the reason for the drop in ID protein abundance (Figure S3I ). USP1 knockdown specificity was confirmed with shRNA-resistant USP1, which restored ID1, ID2, and ID3 to basal levels. USP1 catalytic activity was essential for ID stability because shRNA-resistant USP1 C90S did not restore ID protein levels. Similar results were observed in osteosarcoma cell lines HOS, SAOS, and SJSA (Figure S2C). USP1 knockdown did not impact ID2 abundance in MG-63 osteosarcoma cells, likely because these cells express very little WDR48 (Figure S2C). Consistent with WDR48 deficiency limiting USP1 activity in MG-63 cells, ectopic WDR48 increased ID2 (Figure S2D).Figure 3USP1 Physically Engages and Stabilizes ID Proteins in OsteosarcomaShow full caption(A) Western blot (WB) analysis of U2-OS cells cotransfected with USP1 or control (CTL) shRNAs, plus either empty vector (CTL) or shRNA-resistant USP1 (wild-type [WT] or USP1 mutant C90S).(B) Luciferase activity of U2-OS cells treated as in (A) and cotransfected with an E box-driven luciferase reporter.

Where indicated, cells were treated with 10 μM etoposide for 1 hr. Bars represent the mean ± s.d. of triplicate observations. To determine if USP1 knockdown and decreased IDs 1–3 modulated bHLH transcriptional activity, U2-OS cells were transfected with an E box-driven luciferase reporter gene. USP1 shRNAs enhanced expression of this reporter 7- to 10-fold over a control shRNA, consistent with activation of bHLH proteins when ID proteins are decreased (Figure 3B). shRNA-resistant wild-type USP1, but not USP1 C90S, suppressed E box-driven reporter activity caused by USP1 knockdown, confirming that USP1 catalytic activity is required for bHLH-dependent transcription as well as ID protein stabilization. The acute loss of IDs 1–3 following knockdown of endogenous USP1 suggested ID protein destabilization via proteasome-mediated degradation. As anticipated, the proteasome inhibitor MG-132 did not by itself alter ID protein abundance in U2-OS cells, suggesting that the IDs are intrinsically stable in cells that express USP1 highly (Figure 3C). However, MG-132 treatment did restore ID expression after USP1 knockdown, indicating that ID proteins are subject to proteasome-mediated clearance upon USP1 depletion. In keeping with this scenario, USP1 knockdown in MG-132-treated U2-OS cells increased the amount of ubiquitinated ID2 (Figure 3D). Next, we confirmed that endogenous USP1 associates with an endogenous ID in osteosarcoma cells. ID2 coimmunoprecipitated with endogenous USP1 from U2-OS cells (Figure 3E), albeit not with 1:1 stoichiometry, but this is to be expected for a transient enzyme-substrate interaction. Similar results were obtained in HOS cells (Figure S2E). USP1 also coimmunoprecipitated with ID2 (Figure 3F). Collectively, our results suggest that USP1 is a potent DUB and stabilizing factor for ID1, ID2, and ID3 in osteosarcoma. ID2 stabilization by USP1 was not limited to the setting of osteosarcoma. USP1−/− DT40 chicken B cells (Oestergaard et al., 2007Oestergaard V.H. Langevin F. Kuiken H.J. Pace P. Niedzwiedz W. Simpson L.J. Ohzeki M. Takata M. Sale J.E. Patel K.J. Deubiquitination of FANCD2 is required for DNA crosslink repair.Mol. Cell. 2007; 28: 798-809Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) expressed less ID2 protein than their wild-type counterparts (Figure S2F) despite expressing similar levels of ID2 mRNA (Figure S2G). Consistent with USP1 deubiquitinating and stabilizing ID2, proteasome inhibition with MG-132 increased ID2 in USP1−/−, but not wild-type, DT40 cells (Figure S2H). In addition, USP1−/− DT40 cells reconstituted with wild-type USP1, but not USP1 C90S, contained equivalent ID2 to wild-type DT40 cells (Figure S2I). One potential consequence of USP1 deficiency and increased bHLH transcriptional activity in osteosarcoma cells is induction of bHLH-regulated CDKI p21. Indeed, p21 was increased in U2-OS cells transfected with USP1 shRNAs relative to cells transfected with a control shRNA (Figure 4A ). shRNA-resistant wild-type USP1, but not USP1 C90S, reduced p21 to levels observed in control cells, confirming knockdown specificity in this setting. The tumor suppressor p53, a well-known inducer of CDKN1A, was not increased by USP1 knockdown, suggesting that increased p21 was p53 independent. p21 is a potent inhibitor of cell cycle progression (Polyak et al., 1996Polyak K. Waldman T. He T.C. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Genetic determinants of p53-induced apoptosis and growth arrest.Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1945-1952Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar), so we assessed the proliferative capacity of U2-OS cells following USP1 knockdown. Consistent with increased p21, USP1 knockdown reduced U2-OS cell proliferation (Figure 4B and Figure S3A). shRNA-resistant wild-type USP1, but neither USP1 C90S nor USP1Δ260–300, restored cell proliferation (Figures S3B and S3C), indicating that both USP1 catalytic activity and ID substrate recognition are required to maintain U2-OS cell proliferation. USP1 knockdown similarly reduced proliferation in HOS, SAOS, and SJSA, but not MG-63 osteosarcoma cells (Figure S3D). Flow cytometric analysis of the DNA content in U2-OS cells after USP1 knockdown revealed a moderate increase in cells in G1 and G2 phases of the cell cycle with a pronounced reduction of cells in S phase (Figure 4C and Figure S3E). Apoptosis induction following USP1 knockdown was not prominent; few cells with a subdiploid DNA content were observed, there was no increase in cells stained with annexin V, and increased processing of caspase-3 was not detected (Figure S3E; data not shown). Significantly, CDKN1A siRNAs restored S phase entry in USP1-deficient U2-OS cells (Figure S3F and S3G), indicating that p21 is essential for the cell-cycle arrest induced by USP1 knockdown. If ID degradation in the absence of USP1 caused p21 induction, then knockdown of the ID proteins should phenocopy USP1 knockdown. shRNA knockdown of IDs 1–3 individually did not alter p21 levels, but combined knockdown of ID1, ID2, and ID3 increased p21 similar to USP1 knockdown (Figure S3H). ID- and USP1-deficient cells also expressed comparable levels of CDKN1A mRNA (Figure S3I). Consistent with these observations, ID deficiency caused cell-cycle arrest similar to USP1 deficiency (Figures S3J and S3K), and this was rescued by p21 knockdown (Figures 4D and 4E). CDKN1A is regulated by many transcription factors, including p53, which is activated in response to DNA damage (Kastan et al., 1991Kastan M.B. Onyekwere O. Sidransky D. Vogelstein B. Craig R.W. Participation of p53 protein in the cellular response to DNA damage.Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 6304-6311PubMed Google Scholar). p53 knockdown inhibited etoposide-induced p21 in U2-OS cells but did not block the increase in p21 protein seen after USP1 knockdown (Figure S3L), supporting a p53-independent mechanism of p21 induction. Because USP1 is reported to target PCNA and FANCD2 during DNA repair (Nijman et al., 2005Nijman S.M. Huang T.T. Dirac A.M. Brummelkamp T.R. Kerkhoven R.M. D'Andrea A.D. Bernards R.

Cell Biol. 2006; 8: 339-347PubMed Google Scholar), we also checked if USP1 knockdown produced DNA damage. H2AX phosphorylation that is associated with DNA damage (Rogakou et al., 1999Rogakou E.P. Boon C. Redon C. Bonner W.M. Megabase chromatin domains involved in DNA double-strand breaks in vivo.J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 905-916Crossref PubMed Scopus (1852) Google Scholar) increased after etoposide treatment but not USP1 knockdown (data not shown). These observations, combined with the ability of USP1 shRNAs to arrest p53-deficient SAOS cells (Figure S3D), exclude general DNA damage, and p53 in particular, as intermediaries in p21 induction following USP1 knockdown. We confirmed that USP1 regulates p21 expression and cell cycling via the IDs by rescuing the effects of USP1 knockdown in U2-OS cells with ectopic expression of ID1, ID2, and ID3. ID expression in USP1-depleted cells inhibited p21 expression (Figure 4F) and blocked cell-cycle arrest (Figure 4G). Taken together, our results demonstrate that USP1 suppresses p21 via ID protein stabilization and inhibition of bHLH transcriptional activity in osteosarcoma. Osteosarcomas are heterogeneous tumors comprised of disorganized masses of osteoblasts, chondrocytes, and adipocytes. These tumors are thought to develop from a mesenchymal stem cell population that can give rise to all three lineages (Tang et al., 2008Tang N. Song W.X. Luo J. Haydon R.C. He T.C. Osteosarcoma development and stem cell differentiation.Clin. Orthop. Relat. Res. 2008; 466: 2114-2130Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Accordingly, osteosarcoma cell lines fail to express classical osteoblast markers such as RUNX2, OSTERIX, SPARC/OSTEONECTIN, and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) (Luo et al., 2008Luo X. Chen J. Song W.X. Tang N. Luo J. Deng Z.L. Sharff K.A. He G. Bi Y. He B.C. et al.Osteogenic BMPs promote tumor growth of human osteosarcomas that harbor differentiation defects.Lab. Invest. 2008; 88: 1264-1277Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Osteosarcoma cell lines also express surface markers characteristic of mesenchymal stem cells, including CD90, CD105, and CD106 (Di Fiore et al., 2009Di Fiore R. Santulli A. Ferrante R.D. Giuliano M. De Blasio A. Messina C. Pirozzi G. Tirino V. Tesoriere G. Vento R. Identification and expansion of human osteosarcoma-cancer-stem cells by long-term 3-aminobenzamide treatment.J. Cell. Physiol. 2009; 219: 301-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). In light of the role that IDs play in stem cell maintenance and regulation of differentiation, we investigated whether either USP1 or ID knockdown in osteosarcoma would trigger osteoblastic differentiation. U2-OS cells transfected with USP1 or ID shRNAs expressed less CD105, CD106, and CD90 relative to control cells, whereas all cells expressed equivalent amounts of the unrelated surface marker CD144 (Figure S4A ). Similar results were observed with HOS, SJSA, and SAOS cell lines. USP1 or ID knockdown also increased expression of osteoblastic RUNX2, OSTERIX, and OSTEONECTIN (Figure S4B), and increased ALP activity (Figure S4C). Increased E-cadherin expression and reduced N-cadherin and fibronectin following USP1 knockdown in U2-OS cells indicated a reversal of the epithelial to mesenchymal transition that accompanies the malignant state of osteosarcoma (Figures 5A and 5B ) (Thiery et al., 2009Thiery J.P. Acloque H. Huang R.Y. Nieto M.A. Epithelial-mesenchymal"
https://openalex.org/W2091416343,"Since its discovery more than a decade ago, the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy (Sgr), a satellite galaxy of our own Milky Way, has been recognized as a local analogue to the numerous mergers thought to be common in galaxies throughout the Universe. Traditionally, Sgr has been treated as a negligible perturber to the Galactic disk. New simulations of the response of the Milky Way to the infall of the Sgr reveal that, on the contrary, Sgr has played an important part in shaping the disk morphology. Past impacts have triggered the formation of spiral structure and influenced bar evolution. Like many galaxies of its size, the Milky Way is a disk with prominent spiral arms rooted in a central bar1, although our knowledge of its structure and origin is incomplete. Traditional attempts to understand our Galaxy’s morphology assume that it has been unperturbed by major external forces. Here we report simulations of the response of the Milky Way to the infall of the Sagittarius2 dwarf galaxy (Sgr), which results in the formation of spiral arms, influences the central bar and produces a flared outer disk. Two ring-like wrappings emerge towards the Galactic anti-Centre in our model that are reminiscent of the low-latitude arcs observed in the same area of the Milky Way. Previous models have focused on Sgr itself3,4 to reproduce the dwarf’s orbital history and place associated constraints on the shape of the Milky Way gravitational potential, treating the Sgr impact event as a trivial influence on the Galactic disk. Our results show that the Milky Way’s morphology is not purely secular in origin and that low-mass minor mergers predicted to be common throughout the Universe5 probably have a similarly important role in shaping galactic structure."

https://openalex.org/W1982872797,"Transient receptor potential melastatin 7 (TRPM7) channels represent the major magnesium-uptake mechanism in mammalian cells and are key regulators of cell growth and proliferation. They are expressed abundantly in a variety of human carcinoma cells controlling survival, growth, and migration. These characteristics are the basis for recent interest in the channel as a target for cancer therapeutics. We screened a chemical library of marine organism-derived extracts and identified waixenicin A from the soft coral Sarcothelia edmondsoni as a strong inhibitor of overexpressed and native TRPM7. Waixenicin A activity was cytosolic and potentiated by intracellular free magnesium (Mg(2+)) concentration. Mutating a Mg(2+) binding site on the TRPM7 kinase domain reduced the potency of the compound, whereas kinase deletion enhanced its efficacy independent of Mg(2+). Waixenicin A failed to inhibit the closely homologous TRPM6 channel and did not significantly affect TRPM2, TRPM4, and Ca(2+) release-activated Ca(2+) current channels. Therefore, waixenicin A represents the first potent and relatively specific inhibitor of TRPM7 ion channels. Consistent with TRPM7 inhibition, the compound blocked cell proliferation in human Jurkat T-cells and rat basophilic leukemia cells. Based on the ability of the compound to inhibit cell proliferation through Mg(2+)-dependent block of TRPM7, waixenicin A, or structural analogs may have cancer-specific therapeutic potential, particularly because certain cancers accumulate cytosolic Mg(2+)."
https://openalex.org/W2024490488,"Protein concentration gradients encode spatial information across cells and tissues and often depend on spatially localized protein synthesis. Here, we report that a different mechanism underlies the MEX-5 gradient. MEX-5 is an RNA-binding protein that becomes distributed in a cytoplasmic gradient along the anterior-to-posterior axis of the one-cell C. elegans embryo. We demonstrate that the MEX-5 gradient is a direct consequence of an underlying gradient in MEX-5 diffusivity. The MEX-5 diffusion gradient arises when the PAR-1 kinase stimulates the release of MEX-5 from slow-diffusive, RNA-containing complexes in the posterior cytoplasm. PAR-1 directly phosphorylates MEX-5 and is antagonized by the spatially uniform phosphatase PP2A. Mathematical modeling and in vivo observations demonstrate that spatially segregated phosphorylation and dephosphorylation reactions are sufficient to generate stable protein concentration gradients in the cytoplasm. The principles demonstrated here apply to any spatially segregated modification cycle that affects protein diffusion and do not require protein synthesis or degradation."
https://openalex.org/W2094996600,"The endosomal sorting complexes required for transport (ESCRT-0-III) allow membrane budding and fission away from the cytosol. This machinery is used during multivesicular endosome biogenesis, cytokinesis, and budding of some enveloped viruses. Membrane fission is catalyzed by ESCRT-III complexes made of polymers of charged multivesicular body proteins (CHMPs) and by the AAA-type ATPase VPS4. How and which of the ESCRT-III subunits sustain membrane fission from the cytoplasmic surface remain uncertain. In vitro, CHMP2 and CHMP3 recombinant proteins polymerize into tubular helical structures, which were hypothesized to drive vesicle fission. However, this model awaits the demonstration that such structures exist and can deform membranes in cellulo. Here, we show that depletion of VPS4 induces specific accumulation of endogenous CHMP2B at the plasma membrane. Unlike other CHMPs, overexpressed full-length CHMP2B polymerizes into long, rigid tubes that protrude out of the cell. CHMP4s relocalize at the base of the tubes, the formation of which depends on VPS4. Cryo-EM of the CHMP2B membrane tubes demonstrates that CHMP2B polymerizes into a tightly packed helical lattice, in close association with the inner leaflet of the membrane tube. This association is tight enough to deform the lipid bilayer in cases where the tubular CHMP2B helix varies in diameter or is closed by domes. Thus, our observation that CHMP2B polymerization scaffolds membranes in vivo represents a first step toward demonstrating its structural role during outward membrane deformation. The endosomal sorting complexes required for transport (ESCRT-0-III) allow membrane budding and fission away from the cytosol. This machinery is used during multivesicular endosome biogenesis, cytokinesis, and budding of some enveloped viruses. Membrane fission is catalyzed by ESCRT-III complexes made of polymers of charged multivesicular body proteins (CHMPs) and by the AAA-type ATPase VPS4. How and which of the ESCRT-III subunits sustain membrane fission from the cytoplasmic surface remain uncertain. In vitro, CHMP2 and CHMP3 recombinant proteins polymerize into tubular helical structures, which were hypothesized to drive vesicle fission. However, this model awaits the demonstration that such structures exist and can deform membranes in cellulo. Here, we show that depletion of VPS4 induces specific accumulation of endogenous CHMP2B at the plasma membrane. Unlike other CHMPs, overexpressed full-length CHMP2B polymerizes into long, rigid tubes that protrude out of the cell. CHMP4s relocalize at the base of the tubes, the formation of which depends on VPS4. Cryo-EM of the CHMP2B membrane tubes demonstrates that CHMP2B polymerizes into a tightly packed helical lattice, in close association with the inner leaflet of the membrane tube. This association is tight enough to deform the lipid bilayer in cases where the tubular CHMP2B helix varies in diameter or is closed by domes. Thus, our observation that CHMP2B polymerization scaffolds membranes in vivo represents a first step toward demonstrating its structural role during outward membrane deformation. Studies in yeast have revealed that protein complexes called ESCRTs (endosome-sorting complexes required for transport) play a pivotal role in intraluminal vesicle budding inside endosomes, an essential step for the sorting of receptors toward degradation (1Babst M.

The particularity of ESCRT complexes is to induce membrane vesiculation with a topology that is inverted compared with coated vesicles budding from a donor membrane and released into the cytosol. Four ESCRT complexes have been characterized so far: ESCRT-0, -I, -II, and -III. ESCRTs 0, I, and II are recruited to membranes as complexes (4Hurley J.H. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2010; 45: 463-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). In contrast, ESCRT-III assembles sequentially and transiently at membranes, and requires VPS4 for disassembly (5Shestakova A. Hanono A. Drosner S. Curtiss M. Davies B.A. Katzmann D.J. Babst M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2010; 21: 1059-1071Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Yeast ESCRT-III is composed of seven highly related proteins. Each of them has one to three homologs in mammals, which are grouped into eight families designated CHMP1–7 (charged multivesicular body proteins) and IST1 (increased sodium tolerance-1). In yeast, four ESCRT-III proteins essential for vesicle release have been shown to be recruited on endosomal membranes in the following order: two Vps20p subunits (CHMP6) recruited by ESCRT-II to nucleate the assembly of two Snf7p (CHMP4A-C) spirals, which are capped by Vps24p (CHMP3) and Vps2p (CHMP2A and -B) (6Teis D.

Although all ESCRT-III members and VPS4 are required during cell divison (17Morita E. Colf L.A. Karren M.A. Sandrin V. Rodesch C.K. Sundquist W.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2010; 107: 12889-12894Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar), siRNA knockdown experiments indicate that only one of the two CHMP2, and one of the three CHMP4, isoforms and their direct interaction are absolutely required for virus egress (26Morita E.

Little direct evidence exists so far revealing how mammalian ESCRT-III complexes mold membranes in vivo. ESCRT-III proteins are small helical assemblies that are auto-inhibited in the cytosol and become activated upon interaction with a membrane (12Lata S. Schoehn G. Jain A. Pires R. Piehler J.

One common theme between CHMP proteins is their capacity to polymerize in vitro. CHMP1A polymerizes into large tubes, IST1 assembles into curled sheets (29Bajorek M. Schubert H.L. McCullough J. Langelier C. Eckert D.M. Stubblefield W.M. Uter N.T. Myszka D.G. Hill C.P. Sundquist W.I. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2009; 16: 754-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar), whereas CHMP4B associates into arrays of loose circular filaments (32Pires R. Hartlieb B. Signor L. Schoehn G. Lata S. Roessle M. Moriscot C. Popov S. Hinz A. Jamin M. Boyer V. Sadoul R. Forest E. Svergun D.I. Göttlinger H.G. Weissenhorn W. Structure. 2009; 17: 843-856Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). In contrast, CHMP3 and CHMP2A polymerize into helical tubular structures (12Lata S. Schoehn G. Jain A.

Biol. 2009; 16: 754-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar) that can be closed at one end to form dome-like structures. It has been hypothesized that the tight interaction of the dome with the membrane at the neck of the budding vesicle might lead to the closing of the neck and spontaneous membrane fission (33Fabrikant G. Lata S. Riches J.D. Briggs J.A. Weissenhorn W. Kozlov M.M. PLoS Comput. Biol. 2009; 5: e1000575Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). In contrast to these structures observed in vitro, CHMP4B overexpression in cultured cells led to its assembly into circular filaments at the plasma membrane. Membrane tubes of unknown composition were emanating from the plasma membrane when CHMP4B was overexpressed together with catalytically inactive VPS4 (34Hanson P.I. Roth R. Lin Y. Heuser J.E. J. Cell Biol. 2008; 180: 389-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). Recent evidence from HIV-1 budding suggests that although CHMP4 isoforms assemble within the neck, they do not suffice to induce membrane fission in the absence of CHMP2A or -B. This suggests that CHMP2 may be the minimal fission machinery (26Morita E. Sandrin V. McCullough J. Katsuyama A. Baci Hamilton I. Sundquist W.I. Cell Host Microbe. 2011; 9: 235-242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar) requiring VPS4 to catalyze fission and virion release (35Baumgärtel V. Ivanchenko S. Dupont A. Sergeev M. Wiseman P.W. Kräusslich H.G. Bräuchle C. Müller B. Lamb D.C. Nat. Cell Biol. 2011; 13: 469-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), consistent with the sequential recruitment of ESCRTs and VPS4 to the HIV-1 budding site (36Jouvenet N. Zhadina M. Bieniasz P.D. Simon S.M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2011; 13: 394-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Here, we report that down-regulating VPS4 leads to accumulation of endogenous CHMP2B at the plasma membrane, indicating its presence in ESCRT-III complexes formed transiently at the plasma membrane. When overexpressed, CHMP2B is recruited to the plasma membrane, where it forms long protrusions, partly depending on its capacity to bind VPS4. The capacity of CHMP2B to make plasma membrane protrusions is not shared by other CHMPs, and neither CHMP2A, CHMP3, nor CHMP4 isoforms colocalize with CHMP2B inside tubes. However, CHMP4A and -B tend to relocalize at the base of CHMP2B tubes. Cryo-electron microscopy of membrane tubes shed into the cell culture supernatant demonstrates that CHMP2B polymerizes into a tightly packed helical polymer intimately associated with the inner leaflet of the bilayer. Our results show for the first time that CHMP proteins can form tightly packed helical structures in vivo that associate with cellular membranes. Second, such structures vary in diameter to induce membrane constriction, which indirectly supports the dome model for membrane fission (33Fabrikant G. Lata S. Riches J.D. Briggs J.A. Weissenhorn W. Kozlov M.M. PLoS Comput. Biol. 2009; 5: e1000575Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Finally, our data demonstrate that in mammalian cells, CHMP2B is not only an adaptor protein for the recruitment of VPS4 as demonstrated in yeast but also directly plays a structural role in membrane scaffolding. The wild-type human CHMPs (2A, 3, 4A, 4B, and 4C) cDNAs were cloned from HeLa cells by RT-PCR, in frame with a C-terminal FLAG inserted into reverse primers (supplemental Table S1). CHMP2B, CHMP2Bintron5-FLAG, and CHMP2B-FLAG, CHMP2BL207D/L210D-FLAG and CHMP2BL4D/F5D-FLAG were generated by PCR using plasmids containing HA-CHMP2B or GFP-VPS4B as templates, introducing Stop codon or point mutations inside primers where needed. (All PCR primers used in this study are described in supplemental Table S1.) PCR fragments were inserted into the pcDNA3.1 vector using a TOPO directional cloning kit (Invitrogen). For expression in bacteria, cDNA fragments derived from human full-length CHMP2B (wt CHMP2B and mutant L4D/F5D), were subcloned in frame with a C-terminal His6 tag into the expression vector pETM-13, using NcoI and XhoI. Proteins were produced in Escherichia coli strain BL21 codon plus (Invitrogen). GPF-AMSH was a generous gift from Sylvie Urbé. pCaggs GFP-VPS4B and pCaggs GFP-VPS4E235Q were described previously (37Mahul-Mellier A.L. Strappazzon F. Chatellard-Causse C. Blot B. Béal D. Torch S. Hemming F. Petiot A. Verna J.M. Fraboulet S. Sadoul R. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2009; 37: 200-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Polyclonal antibodies against the C-terminal part of CHMP2B were purchased from Abcam (ab33174). Polyclonal anti-CHMP4A (H-52) and CHMP4B (C-12) were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Polyclonal anti-CHMP4B (ab105767) was from Abcam. Polyclonal antibodies against VPS4A and B were a kind gift from W. I. Sundquist (University of Utah). Monoclonal and polyclonal anti-FLAG antibodies were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. Rabbit polyclonal antibody against β-tubulin was a generous gift from A. Andrieux (Inserm U836, Grenoble, France). Secondary antibodies conjugated to Alexa Fluor 488, Alexa Fluor 594, Alexa 594-WGA, and Texas Red-X-phalloidin were obtained from Molecular Probe. For immunofluorescence, HeLa cells were seeded onto sterile glass coverslips in six-well plates (105 cells per well) in DMEM (Invitrogen) containing 10% FBS (Sigma), and 2 mm l-glutamine (Sigma). Cells were transfected 24 h later with 1 μg of DNA and 6 μl of jetPEI transfection reagent (Polyplus) and mixed in a final volume of 200 μl of 150 mm NaCl. For cotransfection, 1 μg of CHMP2B containing plasmid was mixed with 500 ng of plasmids encoding the other proteins. Cells were fixed and processed for immunostaining 24 or 36 h after transfection. For actin destabilization, cells were incubated 1 h with 1 μm cytochalasin D or with 0.2 mg/ml latrunculin A (Sigma). HeLa cells transfected with a mixture containing 10 nm of each of the previously described siRNA duplexes (17Morita E. Colf L.A. Karren M.A. Sandrin V. Rodesch C.K. Sundquist W.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2010; 107: 12889-12894Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar) (VPS4A, CCGAGAAGCUGAAGGAUUAtt; VPS4B, CCAAAGAAGCACUGAAAGAtt) using Lipofectamine RNAi MAX (Invitrogen). Cells were transfected again after 24 h and fixed 24 h later. Control cells were transfected with 20 nm of siRNA duplexes against LucGL2 (CGUACGCGGAAUACUUCGAtt). The extent of down-regulation was estimated by Western blot analysis of cell lysates. Cells were lysed in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer containing protease inhibitors (Complete, Roche Molecular). Proteins (20 μg of total protein per lane) were separated on SDS-polyacrylamide gels (10%) and analyzed by immunoblotting with the indicated antibodies. Cells were fixed and immunostained as described in Ref. 39Belly A. Bodon G. Blot B. Bouron A. Sadoul R. Goldberg Y. J. Cell Sci. 2010; 123: 2943-2954Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar. In brief, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde. After three washes in PBS, cells were permeabilized with PBS containing 0.5% Triton X-100 in blocking solution (PBS containing 5% goat pre-immune serum) for 30 min. Primary antibodies diluted in blocking solution were then incubated for 1 h. After washing in PBS, cells were incubated for 1 h with secondary antibodies conjugated to Alexa Fluor 488, Alexa Fluor 594, Alexa Fluor 594-WGA, or Alexa Fluor 488-phalloidin. After three washes in PBS, coverslips were rinsed in water and mounted in Mowiol. For staining of F-actin, Texas Red-X phalloidin was incubated together with the secondary antibodies. For delineating cellular membranes, live cells were washed in HBSS, incubated 10 min at 4 °C with Alexa Fluor 494-WGA (5 μg/ml in Hank's Buffered salt solution) and washed in PBS before fixation. Lipsomes were made of synthetic 1-stearoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine and 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoserine from Avanti Polar Lipids. Lipids were mixed homogeneously in chloroform to achieve a 8:2 molar ratio. Dried thin lipid films were obtained by evaporation. Lipids were hydrated in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7, to a final concentration of 2.5 mg/ml. The translucent solution was then extruded 15 times through a 200-nm polycarbonate membrane (Avanti Polar Lipids). The average diameter of the liposomes was estimated to range between 200 to 400 nm by dynamic light scattering measurement and electron microscopy Proteins and large unilamellar vesicles were incubated overnight. The solution was mixed with an equal volume of 80% (w/v) sucrose in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7, resulting in a final sucrose concentration of 40% (w/v) with a final large unilamellar vesicle concentration of 0.625 mg/ml. 300 μl of this solution was overlaid with 100 μl of 30, 20, and 10% (w/v) sucrose in no-salt buffer. The gradient was then subjected to ultracentrifugation at 190,000 × g for 6 h at 4 °C. After ultracentrifugation, gradients were separated into seven fractions. Sucrose concentration of each fraction was determined by refractometry; one-third of each fraction was analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Images of fluorescent cells were acquired with a Zeiss LSM-710 laser scanning confocal microscope with a 63× Plan-Apochromat objective (numerical aperture 1.4). Laser power was adjusted to maximize the dynamic range of each sample. For dual-color samples, the adjustable spectral window of fluorescence collection was set for each channel with a singly colored control sample, so that cross-contamination between channels was avoided. Because CHMP2B tubes protrude out of the cell in a large Z range, stacks of optical sections were acquired with the required electronic magnification. Image files were processed with ImageJ software. Except when mentioned, images represent maximum intensity projections. For isolation of CHMP2B tubes, HeLa cells were seeded in 10-cm culture dishes (∼106 cells/well). The culture medium was the same as mentioned above, except that FBS was previously cleared by 60,000 × g centrifugation to remove potential contaminants. Cells were transfected 24 h later with 3 μg of DNA and 18 μl of jetPEI transfection reagent (Polyplus transfection) and mixed in a final volume of 600 μl of 150 mm NaCl. Culture media harvested 36 h after transfection were centrifuged twice at 300 × g for 5 min to remove debris and then at 30,000 × g (1 h) to pellet membranes. The resulting pellet (P1) was washed once with HBS (150 mm NaCl, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4), resuspended and incubated for 30 min at 4 °C in HBS containing 1 mm AMPPnP 6The abbreviations used are: AMPPnP5′-adenylyl-β,γ-imidodiphosphateMIMMIT domain-interacting motifMITMicrotubule Interacting and Transport domainVPS4Vacuolar Protein Sorting homolog 4AMSHAssociated Molecule with the Src homology domain of STAMWGAWheat Germ Agglutinin. (Sigma), CompleteTM protease inhibitor (Roche Applied Science), and 1% Triton X-100. Half of this suspension was centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 30 min, and the pellet (P2) was resuspended in the same volume as S2. Identical volumes of P1, S2, and P2 were analyzed by Western blot together with the cell lysate (20 μg of proteins estimated using BCA protein assay reagent (Pierce). 5′-adenylyl-β,γ-imidodiphosphate MIT domain-interacting motif Microtubule Interacting and Transport domain Vacuolar Protein Sorting homolog 4 Associated Molecule with the Src homology domain of STAM Wheat Germ Agglutinin. Cells were fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde and 0.2% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 m phosphate buffer, pH 7.3, during 2 h. Cells were then gently detached using a cell scraper, centrifuged at 1200 rpm during 5 min and embedded in 10% gelatin. The cell pellet was then cut into 1 mm3 pieces. These samples were cryoprotected during 4 h in 2.3 m sucrose and frozen in liquid nitrogen. Ultrathin cryosections of 40 nm were made at −120 °C using an ultra-cryo-microtome (Leica-Reichert) and retrieved with a 1:1 solution of 2.3 m sucrose and 2% methylcellulose according to the Tokuyasu protocol (40Liou W. Geuze H.J. Slot J.W. Histochem. Cell Biol. 1996; 106: 41-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar). Cryosections were first incubated with primary polyclonal anti-FLAG antibody (Sigma) and revealed with protein A-gold conjugate (cell microscopy center, Utrecht, The Netherlands). Double immunogold labeling was performed sequentially using 15-nm protein A gold to recognize anti-CHMP4A and 10-nm protein A gold to detect CHMP2B. Labeled cryosections were viewed at 80 kV with a 1200EX JEOL TEM microscope, and images were acquired with a digital camera (Veleta, SIS, Olympus). P1 pellet obtained from the culture media of ten 100-mm dishes of HeLa cells transfected with CHMP2B-FLAG were resuspended in 80 μl of HBS. 6 μl of this sample was incubated during 10 min on an EM grid coated with Formvar and carbon. Grids were then quickly blotted and washed three times in water before staining with 1% uranyl acetate during 1 min, followed by blotting to remove excess liquid. For immunolabeling, samples were permeabilized with Triton X-100 1% during 20 min, and labeling was performed after extensive washing with water using an anti-CHMP2B antibody against the whole protein. Protein A gold (Cell Microscopy Center, Utrecht, The Netherlands) was used to reveal the antibody. Finally, grids were stained with 1% uranyl acetate, pH 4, during 1 min. Grids were viewed under a transmission electron microscope (JEOL 1200EX), and images were acquired with a digital camera (Veleta, Soft Imaging Solutions, Olympus). P1 pellets obtained from the culture medium of thirty 100-mm dishes were resuspended in 40 μl of HBS. 4 ml of sample were loaded onto a Quantifoil R2/1 holey grid (Quantifoil Micro Tools GmbH), blotted for 1–2 s to remove the excess liquid, and then rapidly plunged into liquid ethane cooled using liquid nitrogen. The frozen grid was transferred into an FEI Tecnai Polara electron microscope. Images were taken under low dose conditions at 300 kV (<10 e−/Å2) and with a nominal magnification of 45,000 and a defocus between 2 and 3 μm using a CCD camera (GATAN Ultrascan 4000). Two-dimensional averaging of particles was performed by selecting a total of 35 boxes (900 × 900 pixels) equally spaced along one tube using the x3d program (41Conway J.F. Steven A.C. J. Struct. Biol. 1999; 128: 106-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar) and averaging them together after cross-correlation using SPIDER (42Frank J. Radermacher M. Penczek P. Zhu J. Li Y. Ladjadj M. Leith A. J. Struct. Biol. 1996; 116: 190-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (1808) Google Scholar). Immunostaining of CHMP4A, -B, and -2B revealed that all endogenous proteins were distributed homogeneously throughout the cytoplasm. siRNA knockdowns of VPS4A and VPS4B (supplemental Fig. S2A) led to a relocalization of cytosolic CHMP4A and CHMP4B to intracellular patches, possibly reflecting their accumulation at the surface of endosomes (Fig. 1, A and B). In contrast, similar depletion of VPS4 led to relocalization of endogenous CHMP2B from the cytoplasm into patches, which were associated with the plasma membrane in some cells (Fig. 1, C and D, and supplemental Fig. S2B). This suggests that VPS4 is required to dissociate plasma membrane-based ESCRT-III complexes containing CHMP2B and thus intimately controls ESCRT-III activity at the plasma membrane. Overexpressed CHMP2B was distributed homogeneously throughout the cytoplasm. However, in 10% of cells, the cytoplasmic staining was partially or entirely lost, and CHMP2B was relocated to the plasma membranes, producing long protrusions pointing out into the culture medium (Fig. 2A). Some protrusions had a length of up to several tens of microns. Fusion of a FLAG peptide to the C-terminal part of CHMP2B increased the capacity of the protein to assemble into surface protrusions, which were detected in ∼40% of CHMP2B-FLAG-positive cells (Fig. 2, A and B). Projection in the x-z plane (Fig. 2A) and three-dimensional reconstruction (supplemental Movies S1 and S2) of cells expressing CHMP2B or CHMP2B-FLAG show that the tubes protrude on the sides and above the cell and are rarely attached to the cell culture substrate. In some cases, however, CHMP2B protrusions detached from the cell surface were observed lying on the cell culture substrate. Immunoelectron microscopy of CHMP2B-FLAG-expressing cells demonstrated the presence of tubular, electron dense structures covered by a single membrane (Fig. 2, E and F). The hollow electron dense structures were labeled with FLAG antibodies, revealing the presence of CHMP2B along the entire length of the tubes (Fig. 2F). In tube cross-sections, FLAG immunolabeling was seen in the lumen of the tubes indicating that the C-terminal part of CHMP2B points toward the interior of the tubular structure (Fig. 2E). Expression of CHMP2B also induced the formation of tubes in HEK 293T cells (data not shown). CHMP2B expressed in post-mitotic neurons also deformed the membrane into protrusions in which it accumulates (supplemental Fig. S3A). This demonstrates that CHMP2B protrusions do not result from cell retraction occurring during cell migration or division. In contrast to CHMP2B-FLAG and wild-type CHMP2B, N-terminally FLAG-tagged CHMP2B (FLAG-CHMP2B) remained cytoplasmic and failed to induce growth of surface protrusions (Fig. 2, B and C). Similarly, an HA tag fused to the N terminus blocked the capacity of CHMP2B to induce membrane tubulation (data not shown). Western blot analysis showed similar levels of expression of CHMP2B, FLAG-CHMP2B, or CHMP2B-Flag (supplemental Fig. S3B), demonstrating that the inability of N-terminally tagged versions of CHMP2B to induce tubule formation is not due to differences in their expression level. Based on these observations, we reasoned that the N-terminal part of the protein might be crucial for deforming membranes. The CHMP2B N-terminal eight amino acids are conserved throughout the CHMP family. In particular Leu-4 and Phe-5 of CHMP2B, followed by a cluster of positively charged residues (Lys and Arg) are conserved within all CHMPs (supplemental Fig. S1B). Expression of the double mutant L4D/F5D (CHMP2BL4D/F5D-FLAG) did not deform the plasma membrane into protrusions (Fig. 2, B and C). To test whether these mutations affect membrane binding, a liposome flotation assay was employed using purified recombinant CHMP2B and CHMP2BL4D/F5D. The presence of CHMP2B in the upper fractions demonstrated the capacity of the protein to interact with liposomes (Fig. 2D). In contrast, most CHMP2BL4D/F5D stayed in the bottom fraction, demonstrating that the L4D/F5D mutation impairs CHMP2B lipid bilayer interaction in vitro. These data confirm the requirement of an intact N terminus for CHMP2B function. Because formation of CHMP2B cell protrusions depends on an intact N terminus, we re-examined the expression of C-terminally FLAG-tagged CHMP2A, CHMP3, and the CHMP4A, -B, and -C"

Here, we show that during telophase of an asymmetric division in C. elegans, extrinsic Wnt signaling modulates spindle structures through APR-1/APC, which in turn promotes asymmetrical nuclear localization of WRM-1/β-catenin and POP-1/TCF. APR-1 that localized asymmetrically along the cortex established asymmetric distribution of astral microtubules, with more microtubules found on the anterior side. Perturbation of the Wnt signaling pathway altered this microtubule asymmetry and led to changes in nuclear WRM-1 asymmetry, gene expression, and cell-fate determination. Direct manipulation of spindle asymmetry by laser irradiation altered the asymmetric distribution of nuclear WRM-1. Moreover, laser manipulation of the spindles rescued defects in nuclear POP-1 asymmetry in wnt mutants. Our results reveal a mechanism in which the nuclear localization of proteins is regulated through the modulation of microtubules."

All cell types appear to possess mechanisms that enable a controlled, nonlytic release of ATP, that is, a release not involving cell membrane rupture, and which occurs in response to osmotic, mechanical, and/or neurohormonal stimuli (1Schwiebert E.M. Zsembery A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1615: 7-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). Specifically human erythrocytes release ATP following exposure to β-adrenergic stimulation, mechanical deformation, reduced oxygen tension, or acidosis (2Sprague R.S. Stephenson A.H. Ellsworth M.L. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 2007; 18: 350-355Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). All of these represent physiological conditions to which erythrocytes are exposed in the vasculature, e.g. when passing through constricted vessels or in the contracting striated muscle (3Olearczyk J.J.

Purinergic Signal. 2006; 2: 409-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (716) Google Scholar). Several reports published over recent years have shown that an increase in intracellular cyclic AMP (cAMP) concentration triggered ATP release from human erythrocytes (6Sprague R.S. Ellsworth M.L. Stephenson A.H. Lonigro A.J. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2001; 281: C1158-1164Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Hanson M.S. Ellsworth M.L. Achilleus D. Stephenson A.H. Bowles E.A. Sridharan M.

Receptor-mediated ATP release in human erythrocytes involves activation of heterotrimeric G proteins Gs or Gi/o (3Olearczyk J.J. Ellsworth M.L. Stephenson A.H. Lonigro A.J. Sprague R.S. J. Pharmacol.

Regarding the Gs pathway, activation of β-adrenergic receptors by various agonists was reported to stimulate adenylyl cyclase, with concomitant increases in cAMP levels and protein kinase A activity (6Sprague R.S. Ellsworth M.L. Stephenson A.H. Lonigro A.J. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2001; 281: C1158-1164Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Sprague R.S. Ellsworth M.L. Stephenson A.H. Kleinhenz M.E.

Moreover, direct activation of adenylyl cyclase by forskolin resulted in both ATP release and cAMP increases in human and rabbit erythrocytes (6Sprague R.S. Ellsworth M.L. Stephenson A.H. Lonigro A.J. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2001; 281: C1158-1164Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). extracellular ATP 2′,7′-bis-(2-carboxyethyl)-5(and −6)-carboxyfluorescein acetoxymethyl ester 2′-O-monosuccinyladenosine-3′,5′-cyclic monophosphate tyrosyl methyl ester carbenoxolone. Despite the accumulated knowledge regarding the intracellular signaling events mediating ATP release, comparatively little is known regarding the processes governing the kinetics of ATPe accumulation at the surface in animal cells (11Chara O. Pafundo D.E. Schwarzbaum P.J. Bull. Math. Biol. 2009; 71: 1025-1047Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar, 12Gheorghiu M. Van Driessche W. Eur. Biophys. J. 2004; 33: 412-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), with rates of intracellular ATP release and extracellular ATP hydrolysis being the main actors. The human non-nucleated erythrocyte is an excellent model in this respect, because it lacks intracellular compartments and direct cell-cell communication that would enhance the available signaling mechanisms inducing ATP release, and therefore complicate the analysis of ATPe homeostasis. Among potential candidate membrane-bound proteins enabling a regulated nonlytic ATP efflux, pannexin 1 was identified as a molecule that might associate with the ionotropic P receptor P2X7, and probably other P receptors (13Locovei S. Scemes E. Qiu F. Spray D.C. Dahl G. FEBS Lett. 2007; 581: 483-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). Pannexin 1 appears to either constitute a large pore by itself or to be responsible for the activation of a large pore capable of carrying ions and signaling molecules between the cytoplasm and extracellular space (14Bao L. Locovei S. Dahl G. FEBS Lett. 2004; 572: 65-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (637) Google Scholar). As such, pannexin 1 is a candidate ATP release channel in erythrocytes, because it is expressed at high levels in these cells (15Qiu F. Dahl G. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2009; 296: C250-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). In the present study, we investigated the homeostasis of ATPe from erythrocytes stimulated with agents that increase intracellular cAMP. We focused our attention on the activation of the Gs pathway by isoproterenol, a well known β-adrenergic agonist. Because of the relatively modest increases in cAMP level and ATP release observed with this agonist, addition of forskolin together with the phosphodiesterase inhibitor papaverine was used to enhance the dynamic range of the response. We examined the role of pannexin 1 as a necessary mediator of ATP exit in human erythrocytes. Moreover, by studying the kinetics of ATP accumulation in the extracellular space and the capacity of cells to hydrolyze ATPe by ecto-ATPase activity, we were able to estimate, for the first time in human erythrocytes, the precise kinetics of pannexin 1-mediated ATP release. This allowed us to analyze the interplay between time-dependent extracellular ATP consumption and the release of cytosolic ATP. For a comparative purpose, critical experiments were conducted with canine and Xenopus erythrocytes. All reagents used in this study were of analytical grade. Isoproterenol, forskolin, papaverine, carbenoxolone, cAMP, dibutyryl cyclic AMP, 2′-O-monosuccinyladenosine-3′,5′-cyclic monophosphate tyrosyl methyl ester (TME-cAMP), ATP, chlorpromazine, and chloroacetaldehyde were purchased from Sigma. Pannexin 1 blocking peptide WRQAAFVDSY (10Panx1) (16Pelegrin P. Surprenant A. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 5071-5082Crossref PubMed Scopus (1147) Google Scholar), and its scrambled version (ScrPanx1) SADYRVAFWQ, generated using the online software at GenScript were synthesized at the University of North Carolina Microprotein Sequencing and Peptide Synthesis Facility. The BCECF-AM and Hoechst 33258 were obtained from Molecular Probes (Invitrogen). A monoclonal antibody against an extracellular segment from glycophorin A was purchased from Abcam (Cambridge, MA). [γ-32P]ATP (10 Ci mmol−1) and [α-32P]ATP (30 Ci mmol−1) were purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Human blood was obtained by venipuncture from healthy volunteers on the day each study was done. Immediately after collection of blood, plasma, platelets, and leukocytes were removed by centrifugation (900 × g at 20 °C for 3 min). The supernatant and buffy coat were removed by aspiration and discarded. Isolated erythrocytes were resuspended and washed three times in RBC medium containing (in mm) 155 NaCl, 2.7 KCl, 1.5 KH2PO4, 2.5 Na2HPO4, 1 CaCl2, 1 MgSO4, 5 glucose (pH adjusted to 7.4 at 20 °C and osmolarity to 300 mosmol). Packed erythrocytes were resuspended in RBC medium supplemented with 0.5% bovine serum albumin to the corresponding final hematocrit. All procedures conformed to the Declaration of Helsinki, and written informed consent was given by the donors. In preliminary experiments aliquots of the resulting erythrocyte suspensions were stained with the blue fluorescent Hoechst dye to check for the presence of nucleated cells. Results of these experiments showed only 0.05% contamination of our preparation with nucleated cells. Xenopus laevis erythrocytes were isolated as in humans. Canine erythrocytes were obtained from blood samples as above using a modified RBC medium without CaCl2. In supplemental Fig. S4, a subpopulation of RBCs containing only anucleated mature erythrocytes was used. Cells were isolated by means of a discontinuous Percoll density gradient as previously described (31Del Punta K. Charreau E.H. Pignataro O.P. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 5337-5343Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Extracellular ATP was measured using firefly luciferase (EC 1.13.12.7), which catalyzes the oxidation of luciferin in the presence of ATP to produce light (17Strehler B.L. Methods Biochem. Anal. 1968; 16: 99-181Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Brown A.M. Ellory J.C. Young J.D. Red Cell Membranes, A Methodological Approach. Ellory, London1980: 223-238Google Scholar). Two different types of determinations were made, real-time and off-line luminometry. In most experiments soluble luciferase was used, whereas in a few real-time experiments determination of ATPe on the cell surface was estimated by a fusion protein denoted as proA-luc. In all cases (real-time or off-line luminometry, using luciferase or proA-luc) the same luciferase reaction was used to estimate ATPe via quantification of light emission. Real-time luminometry measurements were performed with cells on coverslips that were mounted in the assay chamber of a custom-built luminometer as described earlier (19Pafundo D.E. Chara O. Faillace M.P. Krumschnabel G. Schwarzbaum P.J. Am. J. Physiol. Regul. Integr. Comp. Physiol. 2008; 294: R220-R233Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Because luciferase activity at 37 °C is only 10% of that observed at 20 °C (20Gorman M.W. Marble D.R. Ogimoto K. Feigl E.O. Luminescence. 2003; 18: 173-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), to maintain full luciferase activity real-time ATP measurements were performed in a cool chamber acclimated at 20 °C. Under the experimental conditions, assay volume did not change during the course of the experiment. Measurements were performed with 3 × 106 cells incubated in 40 μl of RBC medium. Under these conditions the medium has a height of about 104 μm (height at the coverslip bottom of the chamber equals 0). The time course of light emission was transformed into ATPe concentration versus time by means of a calibration curve. Increasing concentrations of ATP from 0.25 to 2,500 nm were sequentially added to the assay medium from a stock solution of ATP dissolved in RBC medium. Also, a calibration curve was performed for each experiment in similar conditions but in the absence of cells. Both calibration curves displayed a linear relationship in the range tested. The slopes of these curves were directly related to luciferase activity. To avoid errors in the calculation of absolute ATPe values only the experiments with similar parameter values of the calibration function with or without cells were used. In preliminary experiments we found no effect of 100 μm carbenoxolone on luciferase activity. In experiments of Fig. 5, detection of cell surface ATP was performed using proA-luc, a fusion protein between staphylococcal protein A and firefly luciferase (21Zhang X.M. Kobatake E. Kobayashi K. Yanagida Y. Aizawa M. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 282: 65-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Protein A specifically binds to the Fc domain of immunoglobulin G (IgG) and, as mentioned before, firefly luciferase can be used to detect ATP by luminescence emission. ProA-luc can then be stably adsorbed onto the surface of intact cells via interactions with primary IgG antibodies directed against native surface antigens (22Beigi R. Kobatake E. Aizawa M. Dubyak G.R. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 1999; 276: C267-278Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The spatial resolution of the method enables the detection of local changes on the surface of cells. For human erythrocytes we used an antibody against the N-terminal extracellular segment of glycophorin A, the most abundant syaloglycoprotein on human red cells (23Remaley A.T. Ugorski M. Wu N. Litzky L. Burger S.R. Moore J.S. Fukuda M. Spitalnik S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24176-24183Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the cell-attached proA-luc assays, erythrocytes (3 × 106) were attached on coverslips coated with 0.001% poly-d-lysine. At such a very low concentration of poly-d-lysine, negatively charged human erythrocytes will adhere firmly and remain discoidal in shape (24Hategan A. Sengupta K. Kahn S. Sackmann E. Discher D.E. Biophys. J. 2004; 87: 3547-3560Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Adherent cells on 25-mm diameter circular coverslips were washed twice with 150 μl of RBC medium and then allowed to incubate for 1 h in 40 μl of RBC medium containing the anti-glycophorin A antibody (1/250 dilution from stock). Adherent cells were then washed three times and allowed to incubate for another 1 h in 30 μl of RBC medium containing proA-luc (500 μg/ml). Finally cells were washed three times and incubated in 100 μl of RBC medium until they were used for real-time luminescence assays (as described above for soluble luciferase). In preliminary experiments using proA-luc, cells were challenged with exogenous ATP in the presence of 150 μm luciferin. Only those cells preincubated with primary antibodies were able to emit detectable light, demonstrating the specificity of proA-luc attachment to the cell surface. Similarly, when monitoring endogenous ATPe with proA-luc, no light was detected in experiments lacking the primary antibody. For the off-line luminometry human red blood cells were incubated with different pharmacological agents. After the incubation the erythrocyte suspension was centrifuged 2 min at 1,000 × g. ATPe levels were determined in 45 μl of the resulting supernatant. A standard ATP curve was obtained for each experiment. Although most experiments were conducted at room temperature, to account for ATP release at a physiological temperature the main off-line experiments were conducted at both 20 and 37 °C. For intracellular ATP content estimations, erythrocytes (3 × 106) held on coverslips were permeabilized with digitonin (50 μg/ml) at the end of real-time luminometry experiments. The released cytosolic ATP was measured with luciferin-luciferase as described for ATPe. After considering the total volume occupied by all erythrocytes present in the chamber, and the relative solvent cell volume, i.e. 70% (25Kwant W.O. Seeman P. J. Gen. Physiol. 1970; 55: 208-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), ATP values were expressed as the intracellular ATP concentration of erythrocytes. A gene expression plasmid pMALU7 was used that encodes the fused gene between protein A and the complete sequence of a mutated firefly luciferase (26Ebihara T. Takayama H. Yanagida Y. Kobatake E. Aizawa M. Biotechnol. Lett. 2002; 24: 147-149Crossref Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Expression and purification methods were described before (21Zhang X.M. Kobatake E. Kobayashi K. Yanagida Y. Aizawa M. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 282: 65-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 22Beigi R. Kobatake E. Aizawa M. Dubyak G.R. Am. J. Physiol.

Briefly, the JM109 strain of Escherichia coli cells was transformed with pMALU7. Transformed bacteria were grown to mid-log phase at 37 °C at which time 1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside was added to induce protein expression. Bacteria were harvested by centrifugation (4000 × g at 4 ° for 4 min) and lysed by three cycles of sonication at 4 °C in PBS medium containing 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The bacterial lysate was centrifuged 7000 × g (4 °C for 20 min) and the supernatant was applied to a IgG-Sepharose affinity column to collect the fusion protein. Fractions were eluted in acetic acid buffer 0.5 m (pH 3.4) and allowed to drop directly into a neutralization buffer (Tris chloride, 1 m, pH 8.0). Fractions were tested for luciferase activity, and those containing the peaks of the activity were pooled and concentrated 6-fold using centrifugal filters (Centriprep, YM50, Millipore Corp., MA). Protein content was assessed by the method of Lowry et al. (27Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Human erythrocytes (50% hematocrit) were incubated 10 min at room temperature either in the absence (control) or presence of stimulating agents. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 4 ml of ice-cold ethanol containing HCl (1 mm) to the erythrocyte suspension. The resulting erythrocyte/ethanol mixture was centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was removed and stored overnight at −20 °C to precipitate the remaining proteins. Samples were then centrifuged a second time at 3,700 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was removed and dried under vacuum centrifugation and the residue was resuspended in 50 mm sodium acetate buffer (pH 6.0). Unknown samples and standards were acetylated and measured by standard radioimmunoassay system using the method described by Steiner et al. (28Steiner A.L. Kipnis D.M. Utiger R. Parker C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1969; 64: 367-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar) with modifications (29Mondillo C. Patrignani Z. Reche C. Rivera E. Pignataro O. Biol.

Reprod. 2009; 80: 144-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The TME-cAMP was radiolabeled with Na125I by the method of chloramine T (specific activity, 600 Ci/mmol) previously described by Del Punta et al. (31Del Punta K. Charreau E.H. Pignataro O.P. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 5337-5343Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). The specific antibody for cAMP was provided by NIH (Dr. A. F. Parlow, National Hormone and Peptide Program, NIDDK, National Institutes of Health). The inter-assay and intra-assay variations of coefficients were lower than 10%. The hydrolysis rate of ATPe was determined by following the accumulation of [γ-32P]Pi released from exogenous [γ-32P]ATP added to a erythrocyte suspension of known hematocrit, as described before (32Schwarzbaum P.J. Kaufman S.B. Rossi R.C. Garrahan P.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1233: 33-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 33Schwarzbaum P.J. Frischmann M.E. Krumschnabel G. Rossi R.C. Wieser W. Am.

Briefly, the reaction was started by adding 1 μm [γ-32P]ATP (0.27 Ci/mmol) to cell suspensions at room temperature. At different times, a 200-μl aliquot of the suspension was withdrawn and centrifuged at 900 × g during 30 s, and 100 μl of the supernatant were poured into 750 μl of a stop solution containing 4.05 mm Mo7O24(NH4)6 and 0.83 mm HClO4. The ammonium molybdate solution formed a complex with the released phosphate, which was then extracted by adding 0.6 ml of isobutyl alcohol under vigorous stirring. After the phases were separated by centrifugation for 5 min at 1,000 × g, aliquots of 200 μl of the organic phase containing [γ-32P]Pi were transferred to vials containing 2.5 ml of 0.5 m NaOH. Radioactivity was measured by the Cerenkov effect. Production of adenosine from ATP was estimated as described previously (33Schwarzbaum P.J. Frischmann M.E. Krumschnabel G. Rossi R.C. Wieser W. Am.

The release of α-32Pi from [α-32P]ATP was followed using a method similar to that described for measuring ecto-ATPase activity. Under these conditions, one adenosine is formed for every α-32Pi produced. Values of phosphate concentration in assay medium lacking cells were used to estimate the phosphate concentration at time 0 of experiments run with cell suspensions. Phosphate content in the absence of cells amounted to 1.5 ± 0.2% (n = 3) of total ATP concentration in the assay medium, and did not increase with time, i.e. the nonenzymatic phosphate production was negligible. Because erythrocyte uptake of ATP is extremely low, any hydrolysis of [γ-32P]ATP into ADP + [γ-32P]Pi in a cell suspension can be defined as ecto-ATPase activity, the time course of which yields a measure of the rate at which ecto-nucleotidases hydrolyze extracellular ATP. That is, whereas it is possible that more than one ecto-nucleotidase can contribute to the total measured activity, the term ecto-ATPase has been used because all ATPase activity measured in intact cell suspensions resulted solely from the extracellular hydrolysis of the γ-Pi from ATP. There may be more than one ENTPDase accounting for ecto-ATPase activity, whereas no ecto-phosphatase activity could be detected in human erythrocytes (35Lüthje J. Ogilvie A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 173: 241-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). To calculate ecto-ATPase activity, time dependent levels of Pi were fitted to Equation 1, Y=Y0+A×(1-e-k⋅t)(Eq. 1) where Y and Y0 are the values of 32Pi at any time (t) and at t = 0, respectively; A represents the maximal value for the increase in Y with time, and k is a rate coefficient. The parameters of best fit resulting from the regression were used to calculate the initial rate of ecto-ATPase activity (vi) as k·A (i.e. the first derivative of Equation 1 for t tending to 0). The 32Pi mass produced from [γ-32P]ATP and [α-32P]ATP was calculated using the ATP specific activity and expressed in picomoles per 106 red blood cells. Ecto-ATPase activity is expressed as picomoles of 32Pi × (106 cells min)−1. In erythrocytes from several vertebrates species, adrenergic stimulation can lead to cell swelling leading to changes in solute intracellular content and activation of signaling mechanisms (36Lecklin T. Tuominen A. Nikinmaa M. J. Exp. Biol. 2000; 203: 3025-3031Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we checked whether the potential volume changes can affect cAMP concentration and/or the rate of ATP release assessed in this study. To this end we monitored cell volume of erythrocytes exposed to 3V, both in the presence and absence of carbenoxolone. Relative cell volumes before and after addition of pharmacological agents were estimated at room temperature using the BCECF fluorescence quenching method, as described (34Pafundo D.E. Alvarez C.L.

Under quenching conditions, fluorescence intensity of human erythrocytes decreased with the increase in fluorophore concentration. This property can be used to continuously monitor changes in water cell volume (34Pafundo D.E. Alvarez C.L. Krumschnabel G. Schwarzbaum P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 6134-6144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). In brief, human erythrocytes (3 × 106 cells) were attached to 0.001% poly-d-lysine-coated coverslips. Erythrocytes were incubated with RBC medium containing 5 μm BCECF-AM during 60 min at room temperature. Subsequently, the solution was washed with RBC medium for 30 min to eliminate extracellular BCECF, and the coverslip was mounted on a recording chamber in a Nikon TE-200 epifluorescence inverted microscope. During experimental manipulations, all media were removed from or introduced in the chamber manually. Changes in cell water volume were inferred from readings of fluorescence intensity recorded by exciting BCECF at 445 nm, where the fluorochrome is pH-insensitive (34Pafundo D.E. Alvarez C.L. Krumschnabel G. Schwarzbaum P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 6134-6144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Fluorescence images were acquired by use of a charge-coupled device camera (Hamamatsu C4742–95) and the Metafluor acquisition program (Universal Imaging). Values of cell volume were obtained from the fluorescence ratio (Ft/F0). The value of F0 represents the signal obtained from a small circular digital region placed at the image plane of each fluorophore-loaded cell equilibrated with isotonic medium, whereas Ft denotes the fluorescence of the same region of the cell at time t. Thus, this measure represents a fractional volume where the initial isotonic cell volume value is 1 and volume changes are expressed as relative to the initial value. A calibration is needed to convert values of relative fluorescence for each cell to relative volume. Calibration was performed by sequentially exposing cells to assay media of osmolarities (in milliosmolar) = 298, 285, 260, and 245. The hypotonic media for cell volume calibrations was similar in composition to isotonic RBC medium, except that the NaCl concentration was adjusted appropriately. During all of these sequential media exchanges, the X, Y, and Z positions of the microscope field remained unchanged. Erythrocyte suspensions used to measure extracellular ATP in off-line luminometry were centrifuged at 1000 × g for 2 min at room temperature. The amount of hem"
https://openalex.org/W1981071130,"Setdb1/Eset is a histone H3 lysine 9 (H3K9)-specific methyltransferase that associates with various transcription factors to regulate gene expression via chromatin remodeling. Here, we report that Setdb1 associates with promyelocytic leukemia (Pml) protein from the early stage of mouse development and is a constitutive member of promyelocytic leukemia (PML)-nuclear bodies (PML-NBs) that have been linked to many cellular processes such as apoptosis, DNA damage responses, and transcriptional regulation. Arsenic treatment, which induces Pml degradation, caused Setdb1 signals to disappear. Setdb1 knockdown resulted in dismantlement of PML-NBs. Immunoprecipitation results demonstrated physical interactions between Setdb1 and Pml. Chromatin immunoprecipitation revealed that, within the frame of PML-NBs, Setdb1 binds the promoter of Id2 and suppresses its expression through installing H3K9 methylation. Our findings suggest that Setdb1 performs dual, but inseparable, functions at PML-NBs to maintain the structural integrity of PML-NBs and to control PML-NB-associated genes transcriptionally."

Mediator is a multisubunit megacomplex that plays a key role during transcription of protein-encoding genes in eukaryotes (1Casamassimi A. Napoli C.

It was discovered as a factor that helps activators communicate with the general transcription machinery in budding yeast (5Flanagan P.M. Kelleher 3rd, R.J. Sayre M.H. Tschochner H. Kornberg R.D.

Since then, the role of Mediator in activator-dependent transcription has become well established among eukaryotes (3Malik S. Roeder R.G. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2010; 11: 761-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar). Recent evidence suggests that Mediator is required for basal transcription as well (8Baek H.J. Kang Y.K. Roeder R.G. J. Biol.

Although Mediator is structurally and functionally conserved throughout eukaryotes, the precise subunit structure and composition of the complex vary within a species and among species (4Taatjes D.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2010; 35: 315-322Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar, 14Bourbon H.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2008; 36: 3993-4008Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Mediator is recruited to the promoter region before binding of RNAP II 3The abbreviations used are: RNAP IIRNA polymerase IIPICpreinitiation complexTBPTATA-binding proteinTFIIBtranscription factor IIBTROtranscription run-onCTDC-terminal domainCF1cleavage factor 1CPFcleavage and polyadenylation factor. and the general transcription factors. The promoter-bound Mediator then facilitates the recruitment of general transcription factors and RNAP II to form a preinitiation complex (PIC). RNA polymerase II preinitiation complex TATA-binding protein transcription factor IIB transcription run-on C-terminal domain cleavage factor 1 cleavage and polyadenylation factor. It is generally believed that Mediator helps in the assembly of the PIC during the first round of transcription and further stabilizes the assembled PIC for subsequent rounds of transcription (15Myers L.C. Kornberg R.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 729-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar, 16Yudkovsky N. Ranish J.A. Hahn S. Nature. 2000; 408: 225-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). Several lines of evidence suggest that the role of Mediator is not restricted to the recruitment of basal transcription machinery but that the complex has a “post-recruitment” role as well (3Malik S. Roeder R.G. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2010; 11: 761-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar). First, genome-wide analysis revealed the association of Mediator with the coding region of transcriptionally active genes in budding yeast (17Andrau J.C. van de Pasch L. Lijnzaad P. Bijma T. Koerkamp M.G. van de Peppel J. Werner M. Holstege F.C. Mol. Cell. 2006; 22: 179-192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Second, genetic analysis in yeast revealed the interaction of Mediator subunits with Set2, a histone methyl transferase, which functions during transcription elongation (18Krogan N.J. Kim M. Tong A.

Genomics. 2010; 283: 211-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Third, Mediator subunit Med23 is required for stimulation of transcription of the serum-responsive gene, EGR1, at a step after the assembly of the PIC on the gene (20Wang G Balamotis M.A. Stevens J.L. Yamaguchi Y. Handa H. Berk A.J. Mol. Cell. 2005; 17: 683-694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Fourth, Mediator-dependent transcriptional activation in a reconstituted in vitro system required the elongation factor DRB sensitivity inducing factor (DSIF) (21Malik S. Barrero M.J. Jones T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 6182-6187Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Lastly, Mediator subunit Med26 recruits the elongation complex containing eleven-nineteen lysine-rich leukemia (ELL)/ELL associated factor (EAF) and positive transcription elongation factor B (p-TEFB) to facilitate the release of paused polymerase into productive elongation (22Takahashi H Parmely T.J.

These studies reflect an extension of Mediator function into the initiation and early elongation steps of transcription. Despite the presence of Mediator near the 3′ ends of some genes in yeast (17Andrau J.C. van de Pasch L. Lijnzaad P. Bijma T. Koerkamp M.G. van de Peppel J. Werner M. Holstege F.C. Mol. Cell. 2006; 22: 179-192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), involvement of the complex in termination of transcription has not yet been demonstrated. Here we provide evidence that the function of Mediator extends well beyond its role in PIC assembly, initiation, and elongation into the last phase of the transcription cycle, that is, termination. The yeast strains used in this study are listed in supplemental Table S1. Strain pairs FY23 (WT) and BPM2 (srb5−); SP10 and BPM12; BPM9 and BPM36; BPM34 and BPM35; and ABP1 and BPM37 are isogenic.

TBP and Rpb1 (8WG16) monoclonal antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology and Covance, respectively. Transcription analysis of INO1 and CHA1 in wild type and srb5− strains was performed by the RT-PCR approach as described previously (24El Kaderi B. Medler S. Raghunayakula S. Ansari A. J. Biol.

Genetic and biochemical approaches as well as electron microscopy studies have identified three evolutionarily conserved, structural modules termed “head,” “middle,” and “tail” in the core Mediator complex (27Chadick J.Z. Asturias F.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2005; 30: 264-271Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 28Guglielmi B van Berkum N.L. Klapholz B. Bijma T. Boube M. Boschiero C. Bourbon H.M. Holstege F.C. Werner M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 5379-5391Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). A fourth “kinase” module dynamically associates with the core complex to form a larger Mediator complex (29Knuesel M.T. Meyer K.D. Bernecky C. Taatjes D.J. Genes Dev. 2009; 23: 439-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). The tail module interacts with the gene-specific transcription regulators, whereas the head module facilitates the direct recruitment of RNAP II and the general transcription factors to the promoter region (30Björklund S. Gustafsson C.M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2005; 30: 240-244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 31Cai G. Imasaki T. Yamada K. Cardelli F. Takagi Y. Asturias F.J. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2010; 17: 273-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Genetic and structural studies have revealed that subunits of the head module make extensive contacts with the RNAP II subunits. X-ray diffraction analysis of the head module of yeast Mediator identified seven subunits organized into distinct domains (32Imasaki T. Calero G. Cai G. Tsai K.L. Yamada K. Cardelli F. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Berger I. Kornberg G.L. Asturias F.J. Kornberg R.D. Takagi Y. Nature. 2011; 475: 240-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). One of these subunits, Srb5/Med18, forms a heterodimer with Med20 and occupies a peripheral position in the overall architecture of the head module (32Imasaki T. Calero G. Cai G. Tsai K.L. Yamada K. Cardelli F. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Berger I. Kornberg G.L. Asturias F.J. Kornberg R.D. Takagi Y. Nature. 2011; 475: 240-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). SRB5/MED18 is not an essential gene, and srb5− yeast cells are viable. In the absence of Srb5/Med18, however, cells grow about 2-fold slower than their wild type counterparts (supplemental Fig. S1). Srb5/Med18 is required for the transcription of a subset of genes in budding yeast (33Holstege F.C. Jennings E.G. Wyrick J.J. Lee T.I. Hengartner C.J. Green M.R. Golub T.R. Lander E.S. Young R.A. Cell. 1998; 95: 717-728Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1595) Google Scholar). It exhibits a genetic as well as a physical interaction with several RNAP II subunits. Srb5/Med18 was discovered as one of the suppressors of the C-terminal domain (CTD) truncation mutation of Rpb1 (7Thompson C.M. Koleske A.J. Chao D.M. Young R.A. Cell. 1993; 73: 1361-1375Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). Recently, Srb5/Med18 was identified as a suppressor of an L111A mutation in the Rpb11 subunit of polymerase (34Proshkina G.M. Shpakovski G.V. Bioorg. Khim. 2009; 35: 572-576PubMed Google Scholar). Srb5/Med18 also exhibits a genetic interaction with Rpb4 (31Cai G. Imasaki T. Yamada K. Cardelli F. Takagi Y. Asturias F.J. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2010; 17: 273-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Structural studies showed the Srb5-Med20 heterodimer in close physical proximity of Rpb4/7 subunits of RNAP II (31Cai G. Imasaki T. Yamada K. Cardelli F. Takagi Y. Asturias F.J. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2010; 17: 273-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 32Imasaki T. Calero G. Cai G. Tsai K.L. Yamada K. Cardelli F. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Berger I. Kornberg G.L. Asturias F.J. Kornberg R.D. Takagi Y. Nature. 2011; 475: 240-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Intriguingly, all the Srb5-interacting subunits of RNAP II (Rpb1, Rpb11, and Rpb4) are implicated in the termination of transcription. Rpb1 is not directly involved in termination, but phosphorylation of Ser-2 of its CTD is a prerequisite for the recruitment of cleavage factor 1 (CF1) 3′ end processing/termination complex toward the 3′ end of genes. The interaction of Srb5/Med18 with RNAP II subunits involved in the termination of transcription prompted us to investigate its role in this process in budding yeast. Because Srb5/Med18 is not required for transcription of all genes, we selected two genes, INO1 and CHA1, whose induced transcription is dependent on Srb5/Med18 (supplemental Fig. S2, B and D). The transcription of INO1 is induced upon depletion of inositol from the medium (24El Kaderi B. Medler S. Raghunayakula S. Ansari A. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 25015-25025Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), whereas CHA1 is induced in the presence of serine/threonine in the culture medium (35Petersen J.G. Kielland-Brandt M.C. Nilsson-Tillgren T. Bornaes C. Holmberg S. Genetics. 1988; 119: 527-534Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We reasoned that if Srb5/Med18 plays a role in termination of transcription of INO1 and CHA1, it will cross-link to the 3′ end of these genes. ChIP analysis revealed that Srb5/Med18 indeed is localized to the terminator as well as the promoter regions of both genes upon induced transcription (Fig. 1, B, lanes 5 and 8, and E, lanes 13 and 16). Srb5/Med18 ChIP signal at the 3′ end, however, was marginally lower than that at the 5′ end (Fig. 1, C and F, gray bars, regions A and D). Furthermore, there was absolutely no signal for Srb5/Med18 in the body of the genes (Fig. 1, B, lanes 6 and 7, and E, lanes 14 and 15). These results are consistent with a role for Srb5/Med18 in the termination of transcription of these genes. Mediator is a coactivator that facilitates the recruitment of general transcription factors and RNAP II onto the promoter of transcribing genes. Biochemical, genetic, and structural studies have demonstrated direct physical interaction of subunits of the head module of Mediator with TBP, TFIIB, RNAP II, and TFIIH (31Cai G. Imasaki T. Yamada K. Cardelli F. Takagi Y. Asturias F.J. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2010; 17: 273-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 32Imasaki T. Calero G. Cai G. Tsai K.L. Yamada K. Cardelli F.

Röther S. Strässer K. Cramer P. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2006; 13: 895-901Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). However, there is no published study suggesting a role for Mediator in recruiting 3′ end processing/termination machinery toward the 3′ end of transcriptionally active genes. In budding yeast, there are two multisubunit complexes called the CF1 complex and the cleavage and polyadenylation factor (CPF) complex that participate in 3′ end processing of pre-mRNA as well as the termination of transcription (38Mandel C.R. Bai Y. Tong L. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2008; 65: 1099-1122Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). Because Srb5/Med18 was found occupying the extremities of transcriptionally induced INO1 and CHA1 genes, we examined the role of Srb5/Med18 in the recruitment of factors at both the 5′ and the 3′ end of these two genes. Our experimental strategy involved analyzing the binding of the general initiation factors TBP and TFIIB near the promoter and the 3′ end processing/termination factors Rna15 and Pta1 toward the terminator regions of INO1 and CHA1. The binding studies were performed in the cells deleted for srb5/med18 and isogenic wild type cells. Our results indicate that TBP and TFIIB occupancy of the promoter region of INO1 and CHA1 remained unaffected in the absence of Srb5/Med18 (supplemental Fig. S3B, lanes 1 and 5; supplemental Fig. S3C; supplemental Fig. S3E, lanes 9 and 13; and supplemental Fig. S3F), but cross-linking of TFIIB to the 3′ end was compromised (supplemental Fig. S3B, lanes 4 and 8; supplemental Fig. S3C; supplemental Fig. S3E, lanes 12 and 16; andsupplemental Fig. S3F). The recruitment of CF1 subunit Rna15 and CPF component Pta1 toward the 3′ end of both genes exhibited a dramatic decrease in srb5− cells (Fig. 2B, lanes 4 and 8; Fig. 2C, region D; Fig. 2E, lanes 12 and 16; Fig. 2F, region D). Because Rna15 and Pta1 are integral components of the CF1 and CPF complexes, respectively, we infer that Srb5/Med18 may directly or indirectly facilitate recruitment of the CF1 and CPF complexes to the 3′ end of INO1 and CHA1. The failure of recruitment of CF1 and CPF 3′ end processing/termination complexes at the 3′ end of INO1 and CHA1 in srb5− cells may be due to a termination defect. An initiation or an elongation defect, however, will lead to a similar consequence. To determine the step in the transcription cycle that affected the recruitment of 3′ end processing/termination factors in srb5− cells, we measured RNAP II accumulation in different regions of INO1 and CHA1 during activated transcription of these genes. An RNAP II ChIP assay was performed in srb5− cells and isogenic wild type cells. The results show that RNAP II was almost uniformly distributed throughout INO1 and CHA1 genes (Fig. 3, B and D, black bars) during induced transcription in wild type cells. In the absence of Srb5/Med18, however, RNAP II signal at the promoter of both INO1 and CHA1 decreased by 3–4-fold (Fig. 3, B and D, region A). These results are in agreement with the well established role of Mediator in the recruitment of RNAP II to the promoter region. Intriguingly, the polymerase concentration progressively increased from the promoter toward the terminator of both genes in srb5− cells (Fig. 3, B and D). The greatest concentration of RNAP II was near the 3′ end and in the downstream intergenic region (Fig. 3, B and D, regions E, F, and G). On average, the polymerase ChIP signal near the 3′ end was about 3–4-fold higher in srb5− cells as compared with the wild type cells (Fig. 3, B and D, region F). An interpretation of these observations is that RNAP II reads through the termination signal in the absence of Srb5/Med18. After passing the termination signal, RNAP II is not released from the template, but tends to accumulate beyond the 3′ end of genes. The readthrough of the termination signal and the accumulation of engaged RNAP II beyond the 3′ end of the gene are characteristics of a termination defect (39Richard P. Manley J.L. Genes Dev. 2009; 23: 1247-1269Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). These results, therefore, strongly argue in favor of a role for Srb5/Med18 in the termination of transcription of INO1 and CHA1. ChIP analysis indicates the position of template-bound RNAP II that may or may not be transcriptionally active. To corroborate the role of Srb5/Med18 in termination of transcription, it was important to show that the polymerase that was reading through the termination signal and accumulating near the 3′ end of genes was transcriptionally active. A nuclear run-on analysis was therefore carried out for CHA1, which has a long intergenic region flanking its 3′ end (Fig. 4A). The detection of any run-on transcripts now reveals active engagement of polymerase. The result shows that the polymerase reading through the terminator region of CHA1 into the intergenic region in srb5− cells is transcriptionally engaged (Fig. 4, B, lanes E, F, and G, and C). No such transcription readthrough, however, was observed in wild type cells (Fig. 4, B, lanes E, F, and G, and C). These results strongly suggest that Mediator subunit Srb5/Med18 is involved in the termination of transcription of INO1 and CHA1 in budding yeast. Srb5/Med18 is not essential for cell viability. The Mediator complex retains its stability even in the absence of Srb5/Med18 (11Takagi Y. Kornberg R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 80-89Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). To determine whether the observed role of Srb5/Med18 on the termination of transcription was due to the lack of recruitment of the whole Mediator complex, rather than the specific role of Srb5/Med18, we performed ChIP analysis for Srb4/Med17 and Med15, which are the subunits of head and tail Mediator modules, respectively. Both Srb4/Med17 and Med15 were recruited to the promoter region of INO1 and CHA1 in srb5− cells with wild type efficiencies (supplemental Fig. S4, B and D). Thus, the recruitment of Mediator to the 5′ end of genes is not affected in srb5− cells. Taken together, our findings implicate the Srb5/Med18 subunit of Mediator in termination of transcription. We provide four lines of evidence that Mediator subunit Srb5/Med18 is involved in the termination of transcription of a subset of genes in budding yeast. First, Srb5/Med18 cross-linked to the terminator region of INO1 and CHA1 during their activated transcriptional state. Second, CF1 and CPF 3′ end processing/termination complexes failed to get recruited near the terminator region of both genes in the absence of Srb5/Med18. Third, RNAP II ChIP demonstrated accumulation of polymerase near the 3′ end of genes and in the intergenic region. Fourth, TRO analysis confirmed a transcription readthrough phenotype in the absence of Srb5/Med18. There is a possibility that the observed defect in termination of transcription in the absence of Srb5/Med18 is an indirect effect. A termination factor may not be expressed or underexpressed in srb5− cells, leading to the observed transcriptional termination defect. The cross-linking of Srb5/Med18 to the terminator region of CHA1 and INO1 upon induced transcription, however, favors the possibility of a direct role for the Mediator subunit in termination of transcription. There are several possible explanations for the role of Srb5/Med18 in the termination of transcription. First, Srb5/Med18 may be directly facilitating the recruitment of CF1, CPF, or both complexes. Second, Srb5/Med18 may be involved in regulating phosphorylation of Ser-2 of CTD, which in turn facilitates the recruitment of CF1 and CPF complexes (40Ahn S.H. Kim M. Buratowski S. Mol. Cell. 2004; 13: 67-76Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). Third, the role of Srb5/Med18 in termination may be through its interaction with the Rpb4 subunit of RNAP II. Structural studies have identified Srb5/Med18 in close physical proximity to Rpb4 in the RNAP II holoenzyme complex (31Cai G. Imasaki T. Yamada K. Cardelli F. Takagi Y. Asturias F.J. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2010; 17: 273-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Intriguingly, Rpb4 has been implicated in the termination of transcription in yeast (41Runner V.M. Podolny V. Buratowski S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2008; 28: 1883-1891Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Srb5/Med18 was found cross-linked to the promoter and the terminator regions of INO1 and CHA1 exclusively during their activated transcriptional states (Fig. 1, B, C, E, and F). This raises the possibility that the molecule of Srb5/Med18 cross-linking to the terminator could be different from the one occupying the promoter region. However, the promoter-terminator occupancy of Srb5/Med18 is only observed during activated transcription. It has been previously shown that yeast genes are in a looped configuration during such a transcriptionally activated state (24El Kaderi B. Medler S. Raghunayakula S. Ansari A. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 25015-25025Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 42Lainé J.P. Singh B.N. Krishnamurthy S. Hampsey M.

Chem. 2011; 286: 33709-33718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). It was also shown that TFIIB cross-links to both the 5′ and the 3′ ends only when the genes are in looped configuration (24El Kaderi B. Medler S. Raghunayakula S. Ansari A. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 25015-25025Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 42Lainé J.P. Singh B.N. Krishnamurthy S. Hampsey M.

Cell. 2007; 27: 806-816Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The cross-linking of TFIIB to both the ends of INO1 and CHA1 upon induced transcription (supplemental Fig. S3, B, C, E, and F) suggests that the two genes are in a looped architecture with their promoter and terminator regions lying in close physical proximity. We therefore propose that it is the promoter-bound Srb5/Med18 that is contacting the juxtaposed terminator region of looped INO1 and CHA1 during induced transcription of genes. In the absence of Srb5/Med18, a unique distribution pattern of RNAP II was observed on INO1 and CHA1. There were few RNAP II molecules in the promoter regions of these genes during induced transcription. RNAP II density progressively increased toward the 3′ end, with the highest concentration observed in the intergenic region beyond the terminator. Because genes are in a looped configuration during activated transcription in budding yeast (24El Kaderi B. Medler S. Raghunayakula S. Ansari A. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 25015-25025Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 43Medler S. Alhusini N. Raghunayakula S. Mukundan B. Aldea A. Ansari A. J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 33709-33718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), our findings raise the intriguing possibility that Srb5/Med18 may be facilitating the transfer of RNAP II from the terminator to the juxtaposed promoter for reinitiation. In the absence of Srb5/Med18, such a transfer is not possible, and consequently, there is more polymerase near the 3′ end of genes as compared with the promoter. Thus, Srb5/Med18 may play a role even beyond termination in coupling termination to reinitiation of transcription.

https://openalex.org/W2083633443,"Anabaena sp. strain PCC 7120 is a filamentous cyanobacterium in which certain vegetative cells differentiate into heterocysts that are specialized cells for nitrogen fixation. Heterocysts are unable to carry out photosynthesis and depend on vegetative cells for carbohydrate to generate ATP and reductants required for nitrogen fixation. Thus, carbohydrate metabolism is very important for nitrogen fixation in the filamentous cyanobacteria; however, its regulatory mechanism remains unknown. In the present study, a nitrogen-regulated response regulator NrrA, which is a transcriptional regulator involved in heterocyst differentiation, was shown to control glycogen catabolism. The transcript levels of genes involved in glycogen catabolism, such as glgP1 and xfp-gap1-pyk1-talB operon, were decreased by the nrrA disruption. Moreover, glycogen accumulation and depression of nitrogenase activities were observed in this disruptant. NrrA bound specifically to the promoter region of glgP1, encoding a glycogen phosphorylase, and to the promoter region of sigE, encoding a group 2 σ factor of RNA polymerase. SigE activated expression of the xfp operon, encoding enzymes of glycolysis and the pentose phosphate pathway. It is concluded that NrrA controls not only heterocyst differentiation but also glycogen catabolism in Anabaena sp. strain PCC 7120."

Here we provide biochemical evidence of dimerization of TRPV1 subunits upon exposure to phenylarsine oxide and hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)), two chemical surrogates of oxidative stress. A disulfide bond formed between apposing cysteines ligates two C termini, serving as the structural basis of channel sensitization by oxidative covalent C-terminal modification. Systematic cysteine scanning of the C terminus of a cysteineless TRPV1 channel revealed a critical region within which any cysteine introduced phenylarsine oxide activation to mutant TRPV1. Oxidative sensitization persisted even when this region is substituted with a random peptide linker containing a single cysteine. So did insertion of this region to TRPV3, a homolog lacking the corresponding region and resistant to oxidative challenge. These results suggest that the non-conserved linker in the TRPV1 C terminus senses environmental oxidative stress and adjusts channel activity during cumulative oxidative damage by lowering the activation threshold of gating elements shared by TRPV channels."

https://openalex.org/W2086442579,"Protein glutaminase, which converts a protein glutamine residue to a glutamate residue, is expected to be useful as a new food-processing enzyme. The crystal structures of the mature and pro forms of the enzyme were refined at 1.15 and 1.73 Å resolution, respectively. The overall structure of the mature enzyme has a weak homology to the core domain of human transglutaminase-2. The catalytic triad (Cys-His-Asp) common to transglutaminases and cysteine proteases is located in the bottom of the active site pocket. The structure of the recombinant pro form shows that a short loop between S2 and S3 in the proregion covers and interacts with the active site of the mature region, mimicking the protein substrate of the enzyme. Ala-47 is located just above the pocket of the active site. Two mutant structures (A47Q-1 and A47Q-2) refined at 1.5 Å resolution were found to correspond to the enzyme-substrate complex and an S-acyl intermediate. Based on these structures, the catalytic mechanism of protein glutaminase is proposed."
https://openalex.org/W2020667687,"Nitric-oxide synthases (NOS) are heme-thiolate enzymes that generate nitric oxide (NO) from L-arginine. Mammalian and bacterial NOSs contain a conserved tryptophan (Trp) that hydrogen bonds with the heme-thiolate ligand. We mutated Trp(66) to His and Phe (W66H, W66F) in B. subtilis NOS to investigate how heme-thiolate electronic properties control enzyme catalysis. The mutations had opposite effects on heme midpoint potential (-302, -361, and -427 mV for W66H, wild-type (WT), and W66F, respectively). These changes were associated with rank order (W66H < WT < W66F) changes in the rates of oxygen activation and product formation in Arg hydroxylation and N-hydroxyarginine (NOHA) oxidation single turnover reactions, and in the O(2) reactivity of the ferrous heme-NO product complex. However, enzyme ferrous heme-O(2) autoxidation showed an opposite rank order. Tetrahydrofolate supported NO synthesis by WT and the mutant NOS. All three proteins showed similar extents of product formation (L-Arg → NOHA or NOHA → citrulline) in single turnover studies, but the W66F mutant showed a 2.5 times lower activity when the reactions were supported by flavoproteins and NADPH. We conclude that Trp(66) controls several catalytic parameters by tuning the electron density of the heme-thiolate bond. A greater electron density (as in W66F) improves oxygen activation and reactivity toward substrate, but decreases heme-dioxy stability and lowers the driving force for heme reduction. In the WT enzyme the Trp(66) residue balances these opposing effects for optimal catalysis."

Whereas mitochondria can independently initiate and complete ISC synthesis, other cellular compartments are believed to assemble ISCs from putative precursors exported from the mitochondria via an ATP binding cassette (ABC) transporter conserved from yeast (Atm1p) to humans (ABCB7). However, the regulatory interactions between mitochondrial and extramitochondrial ISC synthesis are largely unknown. In yeast, we found that mitochondrial ISC synthesis is regulated by the leucine biosynthetic pathway, which among other proteins involves an abundant cytoplasmic [4Fe-4S] enzyme, Leu1p. Enzymatic blocks in the pathway (i.e. leu1Δ or leu2Δ gene deletion mutations) induced post-transcriptional up-regulation of core components of mitochondrial ISC biosynthesis (i.e. the sulfur donor Nfs1p, the iron donor Yfh1p, and the ISC scaffold Isu1p). In leu2Δ cells, transcriptional mechanisms also led to dramatic up-regulation of Leu1p with concomitant down-regulation of mitochondrial aconitase (Aco1p), a [4Fe-4S] enzyme in the tricarboxylic acid cycle. Accordingly, the leu2Δ deletion mutation exacerbated Aco1p inactivation in cells with mutations in Yfh1p. These data indicate that defects in leucine biosynthesis promote the biogenesis of enzymatically active Leu1p at the expense of Aco1p activity. Surprisingly, this effect is independent of Atm1p; previous reports linking the loss of Leu1p activity to Atm1p depletion were confounded by the fact that LEU2 was used as a selectable marker to create Atm1p-depleted cells, whereas a leu2Δ allele was present in Atm1p-repleted controls.

https://openalex.org/W2039804404,"A novel Arabidopsis thaliana inhibitor of apoptosis was identified by sequence homology to other known inhibitor of apoptosis (IAP) proteins. Arabidopsis IAP-like protein (AtILP) contained a C-terminal RING finger domain but lacked a baculovirus IAP repeat (BIR) domain, which is essential for anti-apoptotic activity in other IAP family members. The expression of AtILP in HeLa cells conferred resistance against tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α/ActD-induced apoptosis through the inactivation of caspase activity. In contrast to the C-terminal RING domain of AtILP, which did not inhibit the activity of caspase-3, the N-terminal region, despite displaying no homology to known BIR domains, potently inhibited the activity of caspase-3 in vitro and blocked TNF-α/ActD-induced apoptosis. The anti-apoptotic activity of the AtILP N-terminal domain observed in plants was reproduced in an animal system. Transgenic Arabidopsis lines overexpressing AtILP exhibited anti-apoptotic activity when challenged with the fungal toxin fumonisin B1, an agent that induces apoptosis-like cell death in plants. In AtIPL transgenic plants, suppression of cell death was accompanied by inhibition of caspase activation and DNA fragmentation. Overexpression of AtILP also attenuated effector protein-induced cell death and increased the growth of an avirulent bacterial pathogen. The current results demonstrated the existence of a novel plant IAP-like protein that prevents caspase activation in Arabidopsis and showed that a plant anti-apoptosis gene functions similarly in plant and animal systems."
