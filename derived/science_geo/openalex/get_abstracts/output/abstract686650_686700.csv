https://openalex.org/W4220807057,"The SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.529 (Omicron) variant contains 15 mutations of the receptor-binding domain (RBD). How Omicron evades RBD-targeted neutralizing antibodies requires immediate investigation. Here we use high-throughput yeast display screening1,2 to determine the profiles of RBD escaping mutations for 247 human anti-RBD neutralizing antibodies and show that the neutralizing antibodies can be classified by unsupervised clustering into six epitope groups (A-F)-a grouping that is highly concordant with knowledge-based structural classifications3-5. Various single mutations of Omicron can impair neutralizing antibodies of different epitope groups. Specifically, neutralizing antibodies in groups A-D, the epitopes of which overlap with the ACE2-binding motif, are largely escaped by K417N, G446S, E484A and Q493R. Antibodies in group E (for example, S309)6 and group F (for example, CR3022)7, which often exhibit broad sarbecovirus neutralizing activity, are less affected by Omicron, but a subset of neutralizing antibodies are still escaped by G339D, N440K and S371L. Furthermore, Omicron pseudovirus neutralization showed that neutralizing antibodies that sustained single mutations could also be escaped, owing to multiple synergetic mutations on their epitopes. In total, over 85% of the tested neutralizing antibodies were escaped by Omicron. With regard to neutralizing-antibody-based drugs, the neutralization potency of LY-CoV016, LY-CoV555, REGN10933, REGN10987, AZD1061, AZD8895 and BRII-196 was greatly undermined by Omicron, whereas VIR-7831 and DXP-604 still functioned at a reduced efficacy. Together, our data suggest that infection with Omicron would result in considerable humoral immune evasion, and that neutralizing antibodies targeting the sarbecovirus conserved region will remain most effective. Our results inform the development of antibody-based drugs and vaccines against Omicron and future variants."
https://openalex.org/W4220904663,"The B.1.1.529/Omicron variant of SARS-CoV-2 was only recently detected in southern Africa, but its subsequent spread has been extensive, both regionally and globally1. It is expected to become dominant in the coming weeks2, probably due to enhanced transmissibility. A striking feature of this variant is the large number of spike mutations3 that pose a threat to the efficacy of current COVID-19 vaccines and antibody therapies4. This concern is amplified by the findings of our study. Here we found that B.1.1.529 is markedly resistant to neutralization by serum not only from patients who recovered from COVID-19, but also from individuals who were vaccinated with one of the four widely used COVID-19 vaccines. Even serum from individuals who were vaccinated and received a booster dose of mRNA-based vaccines exhibited substantially diminished neutralizing activity against B.1.1.529. By evaluating a panel of monoclonal antibodies against all known epitope clusters on the spike protein, we noted that the activity of 17 out of the 19 antibodies tested were either abolished or impaired, including ones that are currently authorized or approved for use in patients. Moreover, we also identified four new spike mutations (S371L, N440K, G446S and Q493R) that confer greater antibody resistance on B.1.1.529. The Omicron variant presents a serious threat to many existing COVID-19 vaccines and therapies, compelling the development of new interventions that anticipate the evolutionary trajectory of SARS-CoV-2. The B.1.1.529/Omicron variant of SARS-CoV-2 is resistant to neutralization by serum not only from patients who recovered from COVID-19, but also from individuals vaccinated with one of the four widely used COVID-19 vaccines."
https://openalex.org/W4220673385,"The emergence of the SARS-CoV-2 variant of concern Omicron (Pango lineage B.1.1.529), first identified in Botswana and South Africa, may compromise vaccine effectiveness and lead to re-infections1. Here we investigated Omicron escape from neutralization by antibodies from South African individuals vaccinated with Pfizer BNT162b2. We used blood samples taken soon after vaccination from individuals who were vaccinated and previously infected with SARS-CoV-2 or vaccinated with no evidence of previous infection. We isolated and sequence-confirmed live Omicron virus from an infected person and observed that Omicron requires the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor to infect cells. We compared plasma neutralization of Omicron relative to an ancestral SARS-CoV-2 strain and found that neutralization of ancestral virus was much higher in infected and vaccinated individuals compared with the vaccinated-only participants. However, both groups showed a 22-fold reduction in vaccine-elicited neutralization by the Omicron variant. Participants who were vaccinated and had previously been infected exhibited residual neutralization of Omicron similar to the level of neutralization of the ancestral virus observed in the vaccination-only group. These data support the notion that reasonable protection against Omicron may be maintained using vaccination approaches."
https://openalex.org/W4221116249,"The recently emerged SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant encodes 37 amino acid substitutions in the spike protein, 15 of which are in the receptor-binding domain (RBD), thereby raising concerns about the effectiveness of available vaccines and antibody-based therapeutics. Here we show that the Omicron RBD binds to human ACE2 with enhanced affinity, relative to the Wuhan-Hu-1 RBD, and binds to mouse ACE2. Marked reductions in neutralizing activity were observed against Omicron compared to the ancestral pseudovirus in plasma from convalescent individuals and from individuals who had been vaccinated against SARS-CoV-2, but this loss was less pronounced after a third dose of vaccine. Most monoclonal antibodies that are directed against the receptor-binding motif lost in vitro neutralizing activity against Omicron, with only 3 out of 29 monoclonal antibodies retaining unaltered potency, including the ACE2-mimicking S2K146 antibody1. Furthermore, a fraction of broadly neutralizing sarbecovirus monoclonal antibodies neutralized Omicron through recognition of antigenic sites outside the receptor-binding motif, including sotrovimab2, S2X2593 and S2H974. The magnitude of Omicron-mediated immune evasion marks a major antigenic shift in SARS-CoV-2. Broadly neutralizing monoclonal antibodies that recognize RBD epitopes that are conserved among SARS-CoV-2 variants and other sarbecoviruses may prove key to controlling the ongoing pandemic and future zoonotic spillovers."
https://openalex.org/W4206079892,"The Omicron (B.1.1.529) variant of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was initially identified in November 2021 in South Africa and Botswana, as well as in a sample from a traveller from South Africa in Hong Kong1,2. Since then, Omicron has been detected globally. This variant appears to be at least as infectious as Delta (B.1.617.2), has already caused superspreader events3, and has outcompeted Delta within weeks in several countries and metropolitan areas. Omicron hosts an unprecedented number of mutations in its spike gene and early reports have provided evidence for extensive immune escape and reduced vaccine effectiveness2,4-6. Here we investigated the virus-neutralizing and spike protein-binding activity of sera from convalescent, double mRNA-vaccinated, mRNA-boosted, convalescent double-vaccinated and convalescent boosted individuals against wild-type, Beta (B.1.351) and Omicron SARS-CoV-2 isolates and spike proteins. Neutralizing activity of sera from convalescent and double-vaccinated participants was undetectable or very low against Omicron compared with the wild-type virus, whereas neutralizing activity of sera from individuals who had been exposed to spike three or four times through infection and vaccination was maintained, although at significantly reduced levels. Binding to the receptor-binding and N-terminal domains of the Omicron spike protein was reduced compared with binding to the wild type in convalescent unvaccinated individuals, but was mostly retained in vaccinated individuals."
https://openalex.org/W4205740972,"Early clinical data indicate that some patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer may benefit from program death ligand-1 (PD-L1) inhibition, especially with enzalutamide. The IMbassador250 trial (no. NCT03016312) enrolled 759 men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer whose disease progressed on abiraterone. The addition of atezolizumab to enzalutamide in an open-label randomized trial did not meet the primary endpoint of improved overall survival in unselected patients (stratified hazard ratio 1.12, 95% confidence interval (0.91, 1.37), P = 0.28), despite an acceptable safety profile. In archival tumor samples, prostate tumors showed comparatively low expression of key immune biomarkers. DNA damage-response alterations, phosphatase and tensin homolog status and PD-L1 expression levels were similar between hormone-sensitive and castration-resistant prostate cancers. In planned biomarker analysis, longer progression-free survival was seen with atezolizumab in patients with high PD-L1 IC2/3, CD8 expression and established immune gene signatures. Exploratory analysis linked progression-free survival in the atezolizumab arm with immune genes such as CXCL9 and TAP1, together with other potentially relevant biomarkers including phosphatase and tensin homolog alterations. Together these data indicate that the expected biology associated with response to immune checkpoint inhibitors is present in prostate cancer, albeit in fewer patients. Careful patient selection may be required for immune checkpoint inhibitors to identify subgroups of patients who may benefit from this treatment approach."
https://openalex.org/W4220908091,"Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors elicit antitumour activity in homologous recombination-defective cancers by trapping PARP1 in a chromatin-bound state. How cells process trapped PARP1 remains unclear. Using wild-type and a trapping-deficient PARP1 mutant combined with rapid immunoprecipitation mass spectrometry of endogenous proteins and Apex2 proximity labelling, we delineated mass spectrometry-based interactomes of trapped and non-trapped PARP1. These analyses identified an interaction between trapped PARP1 and the ubiquitin-regulated p97 ATPase/segregase. We found that following trapping, PARP1 is SUMOylated by PIAS4 and subsequently ubiquitylated by the SUMO-targeted E3 ubiquitin ligase RNF4, events that promote recruitment of p97 and removal of trapped PARP1 from chromatin. Small-molecule p97-complex inhibitors, including a metabolite of the clinically used drug disulfiram (CuET), prolonged PARP1 trapping and enhanced PARP inhibitor-induced cytotoxicity in homologous recombination-defective tumour cells and patient-derived tumour organoids. Together, these results suggest that p97 ATPase plays a key role in the processing of trapped PARP1 and the response of tumour cells to PARP inhibitors."
https://openalex.org/W4226275940,"Early use of effective antimicrobial treatments is critical for the outcome of infections and the prevention of treatment resistance. Antimicrobial resistance testing enables the selection of optimal antibiotic treatments, but current culture-based techniques can take up to 72 hours to generate results. We have developed a novel machine learning approach to predict antimicrobial resistance directly from matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization–time of flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectra profiles of clinical isolates. We trained calibrated classifiers on a newly created publicly available database of mass spectra profiles from the clinically most relevant isolates with linked antimicrobial susceptibility phenotypes. This dataset combines more than 300,000 mass spectra with more than 750,000 antimicrobial resistance phenotypes from four medical institutions. Validation on a panel of clinically important pathogens, including Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae, resulting in areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.80, 0.74 and 0.74, respectively, demonstrated the potential of using machine learning to substantially accelerate antimicrobial resistance determination and change of clinical management. Furthermore, a retrospective clinical case study of 63 patients found that implementing this approach would have changed the clinical treatment in nine cases, which would have been beneficial in eight cases (89%). MALDI-TOF mass spectra-based machine learning may thus be an important new tool for treatment optimization and antibiotic stewardship. A machine learning method speeds antimicrobial resistance determination to help tailor treatment decisions."
https://openalex.org/W4206244180,"Nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) embedded within the nuclear envelope mediate rapid, selective and bidirectional traffic between the cytoplasm and the nucleoplasm. Deciphering the mechanism and dynamics of this process is challenged by the need for high spatial and temporal resolution. We report here a multicolour imaging approach that enables direct three-dimensional visualization of cargo transport trajectories relative to a super-resolved octagonal double-ring structure of the NPC scaffold. The success of this approach is enabled by the high positional stability of NPCs within permeabilized cells, as verified by a combined experimental and simulation analysis. Hourglass-shaped translocation conduits for two cargo complexes representing different nuclear transport receptor pathways indicate rapid migration through the permeability barrier on or near the NPC scaffold. Binding sites for cargo complexes extend more than 100 nm from the pore openings, which is consistent with a wide distribution of the phenylalanine-glycine polypeptides that bind nuclear transport receptors."

https://openalex.org/W4205635719,"We aimed to assess the epidemiological, clinical, and laboratory characteristics associated with mortality among hospitalized Egyptian patients with COVID-19. A multicenter, retrospective study was conducted on all polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-confirmed COVID-19 cases admitted through the period from April to July 2020. A generalized linear model was reconstructed with covariates based on predictor's statistical significance and clinically relevance. The odds ratio (OR) was calculated by using stepwise logistic regression modeling. A total of 3712 hospitalized patients were included; of them, 900 deaths were recorded (24.2%). Compared to survived patients, non-survived patients were more likely to be older than 60 years (65.7%), males (53.6%) diabetic (37.6%), hypertensive (37.2%), and had chronic renal insufficiency (9%). Non-survived patients were less likely to receive azithromycin (p <0.001), anticoagulants (p <0.001), and steroids (p <0.001). We found that age ≥ 60 years old (OR = 2.82, 95% CI 2.05-3.86; p <0.0001), diabetes mellitus (OR = 1.58, 95% CI 1.14-2.19; p = 0.006), hypertension (OR = 1.69, 95% CI 1.22-2.36; p = 0.002), chronic renal insufficiency (OR = 3.15, 95% CI 1.84-5.38; p <0.0001), tachycardia (OR = 1.65, 95% CI 1.22-2.23; p <0.001), hypoxemia (OR = 5.69, 95% CI 4.05-7.98; p <0.0001), GCS <13 (OR 515.2, 95% CI 148.5-1786.9; p <0.0001), the use of therapeutic dose of anticoagulation (OR = 0.4, 95% CI 0.22-0.74, p = 0.003) and azithromycin (OR = 0.16, 95% CI 0.09-0.26; p <0.0001) were independent negative predictors of mortality. In conclusion, age >60 years, comorbidities, tachycardia, hypoxemia, and altered consciousness level are independent predictors of mortality among Egyptian hospitalized patients with COVID-19. On the other hand, the use of anticoagulants and azithromycin is associated with reduced mortality."
https://openalex.org/W4206655943,"Environmental toxicants are suspected to play a part in the pathogenesis of idiopathic Parkinson's disease (PD) and may underlie its increasing incidence. Mercury exposure in humans is common and is increasing due to accelerating levels of atmospheric mercury, and mercury damages cells via oxidative stress, cell membrane damage, and autoimmunity, mechanisms suspected in the pathogenesis of PD. We therefore compared the cellular distribution of mercury in the tissues of people with and without PD who had evidence of previous mercury exposure by mercury being present in their locus ceruleus neurons.Paraffin sections from the brain and general organs of two people with PD, two people without PD with a history of mercury exposure, and ten people without PD or known mercury exposure, were stained for inorganic mercury using autometallography, combined with immunostaining for a-synuclein and glial cells. All had mercury-containing neurons in locus ceruleus neurons. Laser ablation-inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) was used to confirm the presence of mercury and to look for other potentially toxic elements. Autometallography-stained locus ceruleus paraffin sections were examined to compare the frequency of previous mercury exposure between 20 PD and 40 non-PD individuals.In PD brains, autometallography-detected mercury was seen in neurons affected by the disease, such as those in the substantia nigra, motor cortex, striatum, thalamus, and cerebellum. Mercury was seen in oligodendrocytes in white and grey matter. Mercury often co-localised with Lewy bodies and neurites. A more restricted distribution of brain mercury was seen in people without PD (both with or without known mercury exposure), with no mercury present in the substantia nigra, striatum, or thalamus. The presence of autometallography-detected mercury in PD was confirmed with LA-ICP-MS, which demonstrated other potentially toxic metals in the locus ceruleus and high iron levels in white matter. Autometallography-detected mercury was found in locus ceruleus neurons in a similar proportion of PD (65%) and non-PD (63%) individuals.In people with PD, mercury was found in neurons and oligodendrocytes in regions of the brain that are affected by the disease, and often co-localised with aggregated a-synuclein. Mercury in the motor cortex, thalamus and striatum could result in bradykinesia and rigidity, and mercury in the cerebellum could cause tremor. People without PD had a restricted uptake of mercury into the brain. The similar frequency of mercury in the locus ceruleus of people with and without PD suggests these two groups have had comparable previous mercury exposures but that PD brains have a greater predisposition to take up circulating mercury. While this post mortem study does not provide a direct link between mercury and idiopathic PD, it adds to the body of evidence that metal toxicants such as mercury play a role in the disease. A precautionary approach would be to reduce rising mercury levels in the atmosphere by limiting the burning of fossil fuels, which may be contributing to the increasing incidence of PD."
https://openalex.org/W4206537610,"As the main forms of carbohydrates, starch and sucrose play a vital role in the balance and coordination of various carbohydrates. Lanzhou lily is the most popular edible lily in China, mainly distributed in the central region of Gansu. To clarify the relationship between carbohydrate metabolism and bulb development of Lanzhou lily, so as to provide a basis for the promotion of the growth and development in Lanzhou lily and its important economic value, we studied lily bulbs in the squaring stage, flowering stage, half withering stage and withering stage. The plant height, fresh weight of mother and daughter bulbs continued to increase during the whole growth period and fresh weight of stem and leaf began to decrease in the half withering stage. The content of starch, sucrose and total soluble sugar in the lily mother bulb accumulated mostly in the flowering, withering and half withering stages, respectively. Starch, sucrose and total soluble sugar accumulated in the daughter bulb with the highest concentration during the withering stage. In the transcription level, sucrose synthase (SuSy1) and sucrose invertase (INV2) expressed the highest in squaring stage, and the expression was significantly higher in the mother bulb than in the daughter bulb. In flowering stage, the expression levels of soluble starch synthase (SSS1), starch-branching enzyme (SBE) and adenosine diphosphate-glucose pyrophosphorylase (AGP1) genes were higher in the mother bulb than in the daughter bulb. Altogether, our results indicate that starch and sucrose are important for the bulb growth and development of Lanzhou lily."

However, owing to the analytical complexity associated with the measurement of GAG concentration and disaccharide composition (the so-called GAGome), a reference study of the normal healthy GAGome is currently missing. Here, we prospectively enrolled 308 healthy adults and analyzed their free GAGomes in urine and plasma using a standardized ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with triple-quadrupole tandem mass spectrometry method together with comprehensive demographic and blood chemistry biomarker data. Of 25 blood chemistry biomarkers, we mainly observed weak correlations between the free GAGome and creatinine in urine and hemoglobin or erythrocyte counts in plasma. We found a higher free GAGome concentration – but not a more diverse composition - in males. Partitioned by gender, we also established reference intervals for all detectable free GAGome features in urine and plasma. Finally, we carried out a transference analysis in healthy individuals from two distinct geographical sites, including data from the Lifelines Cohort Study, which validated the reference intervals in urine.

Our study is the first large-scale determination of normal free GAGomes reference intervals in plasma and urine and represents a critical resource for future physiology and biomarker research. Glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) are a family of long, linear polysaccharides consisting of repeating disaccharide units (1Chen Y.-H. Narimatsu Y. Clausen T.M. Gomes C. Karlsson R. Steentoft C. Spliid C.B. Gustavsson T. Salanti A. Persson A. Malmström A. Willén D. Ellervik U. Bennett E.P. Mao Y. et al.The GAGOme: A cell-based library of displayed glycosaminoglycans.Nat. Methods. 2018; 15: 881-888Google Scholar). Different classes of GAGs have been characterized. In humans, the most prevalent classes are chondroitin sulfate (CS) [(→3)-β-D-GalNAc(1→4)-β-D-GlcA or α-L- IdoA(1→], heparan sulfate (HS) [(→4)-α-D-GlcNAc or α-D- GlcNS(1→4)-β-D-GlcA or α-L-IdoA (1→], and hyaluronic acid (HA) [(→3)-β-D-GlcNAc(1 → 4)-β-D-GlcA(1→] where GalNAc is N-acetylgalactosamine, GlcA is glucuronic acid, IdoA is iduronic acid, GlcNAc is N-acetylglucosamine, and GlcNS is N-sulfoglucosamine. Glucuronic acid can be further modified by sulfation in up to three sites. Chondroitin Sulfate and HS disaccharides can each be further modified with O-sulfo groups, typically in up to three positions in humans. The resulting sulfation motifs confer GAGs highly diverse biological functions that are essential for healthy human development and physiology (2Soares da Costa D. Reis R.L. Pashkuleva I. Sulfation of glycosaminoglycans and its implications in human health and disorders.Annu. Rev. Biomed. Eng. 2017; 19: 1-26Google Scholar). The panel of GAG motifs resulting from the diversity in structure and concentration of GAGs is collectively referred to as GAGome. Alterations in the physiological function of GAGs have been associated with several diseases ranging from mucopolysaccharidosis, a group of rare metabolic disorders caused by genetic defects in lysosomal enzymes that degrade GAGs, to complex diseases such as sepsis, rheumatoid arthritis, and cancer (3Khan S.A.

Cohort 1 and 2 formed the reference sample group to establish reference intervals.Table 1Subject characteristics in the reference sample group (Cohort 1 and Cohort 2)CharacteristicCohort 1Cohort 2Cohort 1 + 2N29216308Age57 (22–78)43 (27–51)57 (22–78)Gender Female1835188 Male10911120Self-rated health Moderate10010 Good1535158 Very good12911140Blood chemistry biomarkers ALAT (μkat/l)0.36 (0.13–2.44)0.49 (0.27–1.1)0.37 (0.13–2.44) ASAT (μkat/l)0.41 (0.22–1.65)0.41 (0.27–0.59)0.41 (0.22–1.65) Calcium (mmol/l)2.39 (2.15–2.72)2.42 (2.17–2.58)2.39 (2.15–2.72) Creatinine (μmol/l)69 (46–167)80 (59–102)69.5 (46–167) C-reactive protein (mg/l)1.4 (0.2–54.1)0.65 (0.27–5.5)1.3 (0.2–54.1) Estimated glomerular filtration rate (ml/min/1.73 m2)82.5 (33–90)90 (76–90)83 (33–90) Glycated hemoglobin (mmol/mol)-33.5 (28–39)33.5 (28–39) HDL (mg/dl)61.87 (29.78–123.74)-61.87 (29.78–123.74) LDL (mg/dl)131.48 (46.4–239.75)-131.48 (46.4–239.75) Potassium (mmol/l)4.2 (3.5–5.2)4.2 (3.9–4.9)4.2 (3.5–5.2) Prostate specific antigen level (ng/ml)0.8 (0.11–9.8)0.7 (0.33–1.4)0.8 (0.11–9.8) Sodium (mmol/l)139 (132–145)140.5 (138–144)139 (132–145)Complete blood count Hematocrit (%)0.42 (0.35–0.51)0.44 (0.37–0.48)0.42 (0.35–0.51) Hemoglobin (g/l)141 (116–178)145.5 (118–163)141 (116–178) Mean corpuscular hemoglobin (pg)30 (24–37)30 (27–31)30 (24–37) Mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (g/l)336 (304–366)331 (315–351)336 (304–366) Mean corpuscular volume (fl)90 (81–101)89.5 (86–94)90 (81–101) Absolute neutrophil count (109/l)3.2 (1–7.7)-3.2 (1–7.7) Basophil count (109/l)0 (0–0.2)-0 (0–0.2) Eosinophil count (109/l)0.1 (0–2.8)-0.1 (0–2.8) Erythrocyte count (1012/l)4.6 (3.8–5.8)4.85 (4.1–5.3)4.6 (3.8–5.8) Leukocyte count (109/l)5.6 (2.8–10.8)5.75 (3.5–7.7)5.6 (2.8–10.8) Lymphocyte count (109/l)1.7 (0.7–4.5)-1.7 (0.7–4.5) Monocyte count (109/l)0.4 (0.2–0.9)-0.4 (0.2–0.9) Platelet count (109/l)261 (137–488)239 (166–377)261 (137–488)Blood chemistry status No abnormal values13511146 1–2 abnormal values1345139 >2 abnormal values23023Distributions are summarized as median and min-max range in brackets. Missing values were omitted. Open table in a new tab Distributions are summarized as median and min-max range in brackets. Missing values were omitted. Subjects’ characteristics were balanced between cohorts (Table 1). Across cohorts, the median age was 57 years (range: 22–78) with 188 (61%) women and 120 (39%) men. Virtually all subjects self-reported good (51%) or very good (45%) health status. The panel of blood chemistry markers measured in Cohort 1 and 2 was the same, except for HDL/LDL (measured in Cohort 1 only) and glycated hemoglobin (measured in Cohort 2 only). Complete blood counts were available for Cohort 1, whereas Cohort 2 had available measurements for erythrocyte, leukocyte, and platelet counts. Blood chemistry showed normal values for all biomarkers in 47% of the subjects, values outside the reference intervals for up to 2 biomarkers in 45% of the subjects, and more than two abnormal values in 23 subjects (8%). The abnormal blood chemistry values were mostly because of elevated calcium (12.2 % subjects), low sodium (10.4%), low C-reactive protein (7.5%), low estimated glomerular filtration rate (7.2%), and elevated prostate-specific antigen (PSA) (5%). We kept subjects with abnormal values in the reference sample group and performed a sensitivity analysis of the reference values within this subgroup. The free GAGomes in plasma and urine were measured in a single GLP-compliant blinded laboratory using a standardized kit on UHPLC-MS/MS in all Cohort 1 and 2 subjects (N = 308). We sought to characterize whether other blood chemistry biomarkers were correlated with the normal free GAGome in plasma or urine. First, we classified subjects in groups indicative of their general health status depending on the number of abnormal values for the blood chemistry biomarkers here tested. Specifically, we grouped the subjects into three groups: 1) no abnormal values (“No abnormal value”, N = 146), 2) one or two abnormal values (“1–2 abnormal values”, N = 139), or 3) more than two abnormal values (“>2 abnormal values”, N = 23). We did not observe any statistical associations between any GAGome feature with any of these groups (Table S1). Second, we investigated linear correlations between the concentration of each detectable GAGome feature and each of the 25 blood chemistry biomarker level (as a continuous variable) and focused on correlations that reached statistical significance after controlling for multiple testing (p < 1.67⋅10−4, Bonferroni correction, Fig. S2). In urine, we observed weak to moderate positive correlations (ρ = 0.23–0.30) between multiple GAGome features with creatinine. In addition, the urine 6S CS concentration was positively correlated with hemoglobin, hematocrit, and erythrocyte count (ρ = 0.24–0.25) and negatively correlated with HDL (ρ = –0.22). In plasma, the total CS and 4S CS concentrations were weakly positively correlated with hemoglobin and erythrocyte count (ρ = 0.21–0.28). In addition, plasma 4S CS correlated with hematocrit (ρ = 0.25), whereas 0S CS negatively correlated with HDL at ρ = −0.22, (Fig. S2). We sought to identify if the free GAGomes in urine and plasma correlated with age and gender that could partition the reference intervals. We did not observe any statistically significant association between age (as a continuous variable) and any GAGome feature (Table S2 and Fig. S1). We observed statistically significant associations between gender and 10 detectable GAGome features (FDR <0.1, Table S3, Figs. 1 and 2). In plasma, the effect of gender was generally limited to an average 7% increase in total CS and 11% increase of 4S CS concentration in males. The urine of males contained on average 31% to 41% higher concentration for the major CS disaccharides (0S, 4S, 6S, and 2S6S CS), resulting in an average 34% increase in total CS; and an average 50% and 73% higher concentration for the major HS disaccharides (0S and NS, respectively), resulting in an average 47% increase in total HS.Figure 2Total free chondroitin sulfate (CS) concentration (μg/ml), charge, and disaccharide concentration (μg/ml) and composition (in mass fraction %) in the plasma of the reference sample group (Cohort 1 and 2).

We thus defined reference intervals for the free GAGome in urine and plasma across apparently healthy males and females between the ages of 22 and 78. First, we established reference intervals for the free GAGome in urine after outlier identification and exclusion. For each disaccharide, bona fide outliers were identified according to a prespecified procedure and omitted (median % of outliers across CS disaccharides: 2% in males, 0% in females; across HS: 3% in males, 3% in females). We then established the reference intervals partitioned by gender of all free CS and HS features in urine (Fig. 1 and Table 2).Table 2Reference intervals of total free chondroitin sulfate (CS) and heparan sulfate (HS) concentration (μg/ml) and disaccharide concentration (μg/ml) and composition (% w/w) in urine by genderFemale (N = 188)Male (N = 120)OutliersMeanReference intervalOutliersMeanReference intervalCS ConcentrationTotal CS [μg/ml]-6.99[1.77–16.04]-8.86[2.62–17.17]4S CS [μg/ml]0 (0.0%)3.19[0.68–7.42]2 (2.0%)4.04[0.84–10.14]6S CS [μg/ml]0 (0.0%)2.07[0.54–4.68]1 (1.0%)2.90[0.87–5.67]0S CS [μg/ml]2 (1.0%)1.59[0.20–5.18]5 (4.0%)1.99[0.36–4.86]2S6S CS [μg/ml]0 (0.0%)0.13[0.00–0.37]1 (1.0%)0.18[0.00–0.43]4S6S CS [μg/ml]9 (5.0%)0.09[0.00–0.41]8 (7.0%)0.10[0.00–0.44] Composition4S CS [%]2 (1.0%)43.66[32.00–55.26]4 (3.0%)42.10[29.31–53.73]6S CS [%]0 (0.0%)29.76[16.38–43.89]2 (2.0%)31.19[19.44–42.51]0S CS [%]2 (1.0%)22.28[6.57–40.65]2 (2.0%)22.62[6.32–46.47]2S6S CS [%]0 (0.0%)1.73[0.00–3.31]0 (0.0%)1.75[0.00–3.24]4S6S CS [%]0 (0.0%)1.41[0.00–4.25]2 (2.0%)1.20[0.00–4.43]Charge CS2 (1.0%)0.78[0.60–0.93]1 (1.0%)0.78[0.57–0.94]HS ConcentrationTotal HS-0.25[0.00–0.68]-0.46[0.00–1.23]0S HS [μg/ml]10 (5.0%)0.18[0.00–0.55]2 (2.0%)0.31[0.00–0.84]NS HS [μg/ml]13 (7.0%)0.08[0.00–0.24]4 (3.0%)0.16[0.00–0.42] Composition0S HS [%]5 (3.0%)52.57[18.65–83.45]5 (4.0%)55.19[32.97–73.63]NS HS [%]2 (1.0%)22.96[1.45–40.31]8 (7.0%)29.72[13.27–41.34]Charge HS0 (0.0%)0.30[0.06–0.47]0 (0.0%)0.35[0.21–0.44]Outliers were excluded.

The CS composition in males and females was nearly identical. The three major disaccharides made up 42% and 44% (4S CS), 31% and 30% (6S CS), and 23% and 22% (0S CS) of the CS fraction in urine of males and females, respectively. Of the multi-sulfated CS disaccharides, the 2S6S CS and 4S6S CS cumulatively contributed approximately 3% to the CS fraction in both males and females, whereas 2S4S CS and TriS CS were undetectable. The average urine CS charge was 0.78 for males and females. The average total free HS concentration in urine was 0.46 μg/ml in males and 0.25 μg/ml in females. The only detectable free HS disaccharides were 0S HS and NS HS. The HS urine composition was 55% 0S HS and 30% NS HS in males and 53% 0S HS and 23% NS HS in females. The average HS charge was 0.35 in males and 0.30 in females. We repeated the procedure above for the free GAGome in plasma (median % of outliers across CS disaccharides: 0 % in males or 1% in females, Fig. 2 and Table 3). The free HS fraction was largely undetectable in plasma (mean total HS < 0.001 μg/ml), and we therefore omitted it from further analyses.Table 3Reference intervals of total free chondroitin sulfate (CS) concentration (μg/ml) and disaccharide concentration (μg/ml) and composition (% w/w) in plasma by genderFemale (N = 188)Male (N = 120)OutliersMeanReference intervalOutliersMeanReference intervalCS ConcentrationTotal CS7.79[4.91–11.28]8.52[5.93–12.78]4S CS [μg/ml]6 (3.0%)4.07[2.07–6.37]2 (2.0%)4.55[2.25–8.02]0S CS [μg/ml]4 (2.0%)3.78[2.26–5.48]4 (3.0%)3.96[2.56–5.82] Composition4S CS [%]2 (1.0%)51.41[36.16–62.06]0 (0.0%)52.64[36.64–65.46]0S CS [%]1 (1.0%)48.02[37.77–64.12]0 (0.0%)46.37[33.92–62.09]Charge CS0 (0.0%)0.52[0.36–0.62]0 (0.0%)0.53[0.37–0.66]Free HS was undetectable in plasma.

The average total free CS concentration in plasma was 8.52 μg/ml in males and 7.79 μg/ml in females. The CS composition was nearly identical across genders, 53% and 51% 4S CS and 46% and 48% 0S CS (Table 3) for males and females, respectively. The remaining free CS disaccharides were undetectable. The average plasma CS charge was 0.53 in men and 0.52 in women. We validated the transference of the above established reference intervals for each GAGome feature in two independent populations from two distinct geographical sites (Cohort 3 and 4) by determining the free GAGomes in urine and plasma in Cohort 3 (N = 110, 60 males and 50 females) and Cohort 4 (N = 30, 15 males and 15 females). The average age was 59 years old (range 30–84) for Cohort 3 and 45 years old (range 22–66) for Cohort 4. We observed that Cohort 3 and 4 had largely similar GAGome measurements. Therefore, we opted to carry out the transference analysis in a group combining Cohort 3 and Cohort 4, partitioned by gender (N = 140, 65 females and 75 males, see Tables S4 and S5 for transference analyses on separate cohorts). Across all free GAGome features in urine, we excluded 0 to 9.2% (median = 1.5%) outliers in females and 0 to 12% (median = 3.3%) in males. Across all free GAGome features in plasma, we excluded 0 to 4.6% (median = 1.5%) outliers in females and 0 to 1.3% (median = 0%) in males. We next determined the percentage of values outside the established reference limits for each urine and plasma GAGome feature, where <5% was considered acceptable for transference validation. In urine, we observed that the transference of reference intervals was validated in both genders for the concentration of all detectable free GAGome features (Table 4). The total urine CS was outside the reference interval in 5.6% samples, whereas all samples had total HS within the reference interval. As regards composition, we observed a shift toward a higher 4S CS % (mean in reference sample group: 44% in females, 42% in males; in transference group: 50% in females, 47% in males) and concomitantly other smaller shifts toward lower composition values for the remaining CS disaccharides.Table 4Transference of reference intervals of free chondroitin sulfate (CS) and heparan sulfate (HS) in urine in an independent population (Cohorts 3 and 4)Female (N = 65)Male (N = 75)NMeanReference intervalCohort rangeOutside reference intervalNMeanReference intervalCohort rangeOutside reference intervalCS ConcentrationTotal CS [μg/ml]626.21.8–16.02.3–18.82 (3.2%)728.72.6–17.22.5–26.74 (5.6%)4S CS [μg/ml]653.10.7–7.41.0–10.22 (3.1%)754.10.8–10.11.4–14.02 (2.7%)6S CS [μg/ml]651.60.5–4.70.7–6.91 (1.5%)742.20.9–5.70.7–7.33 (4.1%)0S CS [μg/ml]621.20.2–5.20.3–4.90 (0.0%)731.90.4–4.90.5–5.22 (2.7%)2S6S CS [μg/ml]640.10.0–0.40.0–0.42 (3.1%)700.20.0–0.40.0–0.41 (1.4%)4S6S CS [μg/ml]650.10.0–0.40.0–0.40 (0.0%)700.20.0–0.40.0–0.40 (0.0%) Composition4S CS [%]6049.432.0–55.332.4–61.813 (21.7%)7246.929.3–53.735.4–57.410 (13.9%)6S CS [%]6225.416.4–43.914.2–33.22 (3.2%)7325.519.4–42.517.1–33.75 (6.8%)0S CS [%]6419.66.6–40.65.5–44.13 (4.7%)7522.26.3–46.56.9–50.61 (1.3%)2S6S CS [%]642.00.0–3.30.5–3.42 (3.1%)682.00.0–3.20.6–3.62 (2.9%)4S6S CS [%]651.90.0–4.20.0–4.62 (3.1%)752.00.0–4.40.0–4.81 (1.3%)Charge CS640.80.6–0.90.6–0.96 (9.4%)740.80.6–0.90.6–0.90 (0.0%)HS ConcentrationTotal HS [μg/ml]590.30.0–0.70.0–0.71 (1.7%)660.30.0–1.20.0–0.80 (0.0%)0S HS [μg/ml]610.20.0–0.60.0–0.72 (3.3%)700.20.0–0.80.0–0.80 (0.0%)NS HS [μg/ml]610.10.0–0.20.0–0.21 (1.6%)680.10.0–0.40.0–0.22 (2.9%) Composition0S HS [%]6555.518.6–83.56.4–80.63 (4.6%)7552.733.0–73.62.3–74.79 (12.0%)NS HS [%]6222.61.4–40.38.8–30.70 (0.0%)7123.413.3–41.310.9–34.96 (8.5%)Charge HS650.50.1–0.50.2–1.033 (50.8%)750.50.2–0.40.3–1.041 (54.7%)Outliers were excluded.

Analytical performance of a standardized kit for mass spectrometry-based measurements of human glycosaminoglycans.J. Chromatogr. B. 2021; 1177: 122761Google Scholar). In addition, the extensive demographic and biochemical characterization of subjects allowed us to assess novel correlations with the free GAGome. We found that no free GAGome feature showed any notable differences with respect to age in adults. Although this finding in urine agree with previous studies analyzing total — as opposed to free — GAGomes (16Larking P.W. McDonald B.W. Taylor M.L. Kirkland A.D. Urine glycosaminoglycans in a reference population: Effects of age, body surface area, and postmenopausal status.Biochem. Med. Metab.

Total glycosaminoglycans in the plasma of adults: Effects of age and gender, and relationship to plasma lipids: A preliminary study.Biochem. Med. Metab. Biol. 1989; 42: 192-197Google Scholar). In contrast to age, we found that the concentrations of several CS and HS disaccharides were higher in males than females with a larger effect in urine than plasma. Previous studies noted gender differences in total GAGomes, although in the opposite directions for both urine and plasma (16Larking P.W. McDonald B.W. Taylor M.L. Kirkland A.D.

https://openalex.org/W4206665754,"Background Gestational weight gain (GWG) and prepregnancy obesity are garnering more attention as determining factors of pregnancy outcomes when it comes to the wellbeing of both the mother and her baby. This study was conducted to describe the pattern of GWG among participants of Riyadh Mother and Baby Multicenter Cohort Study (RAHMA) and to investigate the detrimental effects of excessive GWG and prepregnancy obesity on pregnancy outcomes. Methods RAHMA is a multicentre cohort study conducted in three hospitals in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. Participants were categorized according to the Institute of Medicine into inadequate, adequate, and excessive GWG, and stratified by body mass index (BMI) into under/normal weight, overweight, and obese. To examine the independent effect of maternal prepregnancy obesity and GWG, a multivariate regression model was used and adjusted odds ratio (AOR) and 95% Confidence Interval (CI) for each outcome were calculated. Results A total of 7029 participants were included in this study; 31.8% had adequate GWG, 25.9% had excessive GWG and 42.3% had inadequate GWG, while 29.7% had normal BMI, 33.3% were overweight, 34.8% were obese, and 2.2% were underweight. Excessive GWG was independently associated with increased risk of hypertensive events, (AOR = 1.77, 95% CI 1.20–2.63). Obesity was associated with higher risk of gestational diabetes (AOR 2.11, 95% CI 1.76–2.53), hypertensive events (AOR 2.06, 95% CI 1.48–3.01), and delivery by emergency caesarean section (AOR = 1.63, 95% CI 1.35–1.97). Infants of obese women had increased odds of macrosomia (AOR 3.11, 95% CI 1.94–4.99) and lower odds of low birth weight (AOR = 0.68, 95% CI 0.53–0.88). Conclusion In comparison to excessive GWG, which increases the risk of hypertensive events during pregnancy, prepregnancy obesity is associated with more adverse outcomes including GDM, hypertensive events in pregnancy and emergency CS."
https://openalex.org/W4205633610,"With the increasing popularity of local blending of fertilisers, the fertiliser industry faces issues regarding quality control and fertiliser adulteration. Another problem is the contamination of fertilisers with trace elements that have been shown to subsequently accumulate in the soil and be taken up by plants, posing a danger to the environment and human health. Conventional characterisation methods necessary to ensure the quality of fertilisers and to comply with local regulations are costly, time consuming and sometimes not even accessible. Alternatively, using a wide range of unamended and intentionally amended fertilisers this study developed empirical calibrations for a portable handheld X-ray fluorescence (pXRF) spectrometer, determined the reliability for estimating the macro and micro nutrients and evaluated the use of the pXRF for the high-throughput detection of trace element contaminants in fertilisers. The models developed using pXRF for Mg, P, S, K, Ca, Mn, Fe, Zn and Mo had R2 values greater or equal to 0.97. These models also performed well on validation, with R2 values greater or equal to 0.97 (except for Fe, R2val = 0.55) and slope values ranging from 0.81 to 1.44. A second set of models were developed with a focus on trace elements in amended fertilisers. The R2 values of calibration for Co, Ni, As, Se, Cd and Pb were greater than or equal to 0.80. At concentrations up to 1000 mg kg-1, good validation statistics were also obtained; R2 values ranged from 0.97-0.99, except in one instance. The regression coefficients of the validation also had good prediction in the range of 0-100 mg kg-1 (R2 values were from 0.78-0.99), but not as well at lower concentrations up to 20 mg kg-1 (R2 values ranged from 0.10-0.99), especially for Cd. This study has demonstrated that pXRF can measure several major (P, Ca) and micro (Mn, Fe, Cu) nutrients, as well as trace elements and potential contaminants (Cr, Ni, As) in fertilisers with high accuracy and precision. The results obtained in this study is good, especially considering that loose powders were scanned for a maximum of 90 seconds without the use of a vacuum pump."
https://openalex.org/W4205808424,"Metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) is commonly treated by androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) in combination with chemotherapy. Immune therapy by checkpoint inhibitors, has become a powerful new tool in the treatment of melanoma and lung cancer, and it is currently being used in clinical trials in other cancers, including mCRPC. However, so far, clinical trials with PD-1 and CTLA-4 inhibitors have been disappointing. In the present paper we develop a mathematical model to assess the efficacy of any combination of ADT with cancer vaccine, PD-1 inhibitor, and CTLA-4 inhibitor. The model is represented by a system of partial differential equations (PDEs) for cells, cytokines and drugs whose density/concentration evolves in time within the tumor. Efficacy of treatment is determined by the reduction in tumor volume at the endpoint of treatment. In mice experiments with ADT and various combinations of PD-1 and CTLA-4 inhibitors, tumor volume at day 30 was always larger than the initial tumor. Our model, however, shows that we can decrease tumor volume with large enough dose; for example, with 10 fold increase in the dose of anti-PD-1, initial tumor volume will decrease by 60%. Although the treatment with ADT in combination with PD-1 inhibitor or CTLA-4 inhibitor has been disappointing in clinical trials, our simulations suggest that, disregarding negative effects, combinations of ADT with checkpoint inhibitors can be effective in reducing tumor volume if larger doses are used. This points to the need for determining the optimal combination and amounts of dose for individual patients."
https://openalex.org/W4206004822,"ASC is an essential adaptor of the inflammasome, a micrometer-size multiprotein complex that processes proinflammatory cytokines. Inflammasome formation depends on ASC self-association into large assemblies via homotypic interactions of its two death domains, PYD and CARD. ASCb, an alternative splicing isoform, activates the inflammasome to a lesser extent compared with ASC. Thus, it has been postulated that adaptor isoforms differentially regulate inflammasome function. At the amino acid level, ASC and ASCb differ only in the length of the linker connecting the two death domains. To understand inflammasome regulation at the molecular level, we investigated the self-association properties of ASC and ASCb using real-time NMR, dynamic light scattering (DLS), size-exclusion chromatography, and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The NMR data indicate that ASC self-association is faster than that of ASCb; a kinetic model for this oligomerization results in differing values for both the reaction order and the rate constants. Furthermore, DLS analysis indicates that ASC self-associates into more compact macrostructures compared with ASCb. Finally, TEM data show that ASCb has a reduced tendency to form densely packed filaments relative to ASC. Overall, these differences can only be explained by an effect of the linker length, as the NMR results show structural equivalence of the PYD and CARD in both proteins. The effect of linker length was corroborated by molecular docking with the procaspase-1 CARD domain. Altogether, our results indicate that ASC’s faster and less polydisperse polymerization is more efficient, plausibly explaining inflammasome activation differences by ASC isoforms at the molecular level.

Altogether, our results indicate that ASC’s faster and less polydisperse polymerization is more efficient, plausibly explaining inflammasome activation differences by ASC isoforms at the molecular level. Inflammation is a vital physiological process that protects organisms from pathogens and injury. The inflammatory response is triggered by a myriad of stimuli that have been classified as pathogen- and damage-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs and DAMPs, respectively) (1Kawai T. Akira S. The roles of TLRs, RLRs and NLRs in pathogen recognition.Int. Immunol. 2009; 21: 317-337Google Scholar, 2Man S.M. Kanneganti T.-D. Regulation of inflammasome activation.Immunol. Rev. 2015; 265: 6-21Google Scholar). The presence of these danger signals prompts the formation of a multimeric protein complex known as the inflammasome. The assembly of the inflammasome is driven by self-association and oligomerization of three types of proteins: sensor, adaptor, and effector. There are different families of inflammasome sensors that show specificity for certain PAMPS and DAMPS. Cytosolic sensors are mainly represented by the NLRs (nucleotide-binding domain leucine-rich repeat containing receptors) and ALRs (absent in melanoma 2-like receptors) families and pyrin (3Sharma M. de Alba E. Structure, activation and regulation of NLRP3 and AIM2 inflammasomes.Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2021; 22: 872Google Scholar, 4Sharma D. Kanneganti T.-D.

Inflammasome sensors are modular and typically contain protein–protein interacting death domains: PYD (pyrin domain) and CARD (caspase activation and recruitment domain) (7Park H.H. Lo Y.-C.

Activation and assembly of the inflammasomes through conserved protein domain families.Apoptosis. 2015; 20: 151-156Google Scholar). Inflammasome sensors self-associate upon activation by danger signals and prompt the oligomerization of the inflammasome adaptor ASC (apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a CARD), a bimodular protein with an N-terminal PYD and a C-terminal CARD (3Sharma M. de Alba E.

The inflammasome adaptor acts as a molecular glue by self-associating and tethering multiple copies of the sensor and the effector procaspase-1 (3Sharma M. de Alba E. Structure, activation and regulation of NLRP3 and AIM2 inflammasomes.Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2021; 22: 872Google Scholar, 11Diaz-Parga P. de Alba E.

The inflammasome adapter ASC assembles into filaments with integral participation of its two death domains, PYD and CARD.J. Biol. Chem. 2019; 294: 439-452Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). Inflammasome assembly leads to the activation of procaspase-1, rendering it capable of cleaving pro-IL-1β and pro-IL-18 into their active forms, which are secreted to the extracellular environment to trigger the inflammatory response. Inflammasomes are ∼0.5 μm-size perinuclear puncta formed in the cytosol of activated cells by the oligomerization and self-association of sensor, adaptor, and procaspase-1 (13Man S.M. Hopkins L.J. Nugent E. Cox S. Gluck I.M. Tourlomousis P. Wright J.A. Cicuta P. Monie T.P. Bryant C.E. Inflammasome activation causes dual recruitment of NLRC4 and NLRP3 to the same macromolecular complex.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2014; 111: 7403-7408Google Scholar). The NLR member NLRP3 is one of the most well-known inflammasome sensors. NLRP3 is expressed in myeloid, muscle and endocrine cells, and neurons (14Duez H. Pourcet B. Nuclear receptors in the control of the NLRP3 inflammasome pathway.Front. Endocrinol. 2021; 12: 630536Google Scholar). NLRP3 remains in an autoinhibited form in the resting state and becomes activated upon stimulation, assembling into a large, micrometer-size cytosolic complex together with the adaptor ASC. NLRP3 becomes functional in a two-step process: priming and activation (15Kelley N. Jeltema D. Duan Y. He Y. The NLRP3 inflammasome: An overview of mechanisms of activation and regulation.Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2019; 20: 328Google Scholar). In the priming step, Toll-like receptors (TLRs) or NODs (nucleotide binding oligomerization domain) and cytokines such as TNF-α trigger the activation of the transcription factor NF-κB promoting the expression of the inflammasome components: NLRP3, procaspase-1, and pro-IL-1β (15Kelley N. Jeltema D. Duan Y. He Y. The NLRP3 inflammasome: An overview of mechanisms of activation and regulation.Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2019; 20: 328Google Scholar, 16Elliott E.I. Sutterwala F.S. Initiation and perpetuation of NLRP3 inflammasome activation and assembly.Immunol. Rev. 2015; 265: 35-52Google Scholar). Subsequent posttranslation modifications (ubiquitylation, phosphorylation, and sumoylation) of NLRP3 stabilize the protein in a signal-competent, autosuppressed inactive state that transforms into an activated state upon stimulation (17Barry R. John S.W. Liccardi G. Tenev T. Jaco I. Chen C.-H. Choi J. Kasperkiewicz P. Fernandes-Alnemri T. Alnemri E. Drag M. Chen Y. Meier P. SUMO-mediated regulation of NLRP3 modulates inflammasome activity.Nat. Commun. 2018; 9: 3001Google Scholar). Once activated, NLRP3 assembles into the inflammasome: a mature multiprotein-complex particle also composed of ASC and procaspase-1 (the NLRP3 inflammasome), capable of activating IL-1β and IL-18. The dysregulation of the inflammasome is linked to uncontrolled inflammation as the culprit of an increasing number of inflammatory diseases including rheumatoid arthritis, type I diabetes, asthma, psoriasis, atherosclerosis, and neurodegenerative disorders (18Friker L.L. Scheiblich H. Hochheiser I.V. Brinkschulte R. Riedel D. Latz E. Geyer M. Heneka M.T. β-amyloid clustering around ASC fibrils boosts its toxicity in microglia.Cell Rep. 2020; 30: 3743-3754.e6Google Scholar, 19Pirzada R.H. Javaid N. Choi S. The roles of the NLRP3 inflammasome in neurodegenerative and metabolic diseases and in relevant advanced therapeutic interventions.Genes. 2020; 11: 131Google Scholar). Therefore, gaining insight into the mechanisms involved in inflammasome regulation and assembly is critical to identify potential targets for therapeutic treatment. Protein isoforms share highly similar amino acid sequences and structures and are known to participate in regulatory roles by tuning and modulating protein function. Thus, the study of the molecular bases underpinning function modulation by protein isoforms is particularly relevant to understand regulation at the molecular level. The inflammasome adaptor ASC has four isoforms: canonical ASC, ASCb, ASCc, and ASCd, which differ in amino acid composition (20Bryan N.B. Dorfleutner A. Kramer S.J. Yun C. Rojanasakul Y. Stehlik C. Differential splicing of the apoptosis-associated speck like protein containing a caspase recruitment domain (ASC) regulates inflammasomes.J. Inflamm. 2010; 7: 23Google Scholar). ASC and ASCb are the most similar as both retain the two protein–protein interacting domains, PYD and CARD (Fig. 2A), and only differ in the length of the interdomain linker (23 and three amino acids for ASC and ASCb, respectively). ASCc retains the CARD and a fragment of the PYD. ASCd bears only a partial PYD and no CARD. It has been reported that only ASC and ASCb are inflammasome-activating isoforms, as both promote the release of IL-1β (21Matsushita K. Takeoka M. Sagara J. Itano N. Kurose Y. Nakamura A. Taniguchi S. A splice variant of ASC regulates IL-1 β release and aggregates differently from intact ASC.Mediators Inflamm. 2009; 2009: 1-6Google Scholar) and have been shown to colocalize with NLRP3 and procaspase-1 (20Bryan N.B. Dorfleutner A. Kramer S.J. Yun C. Rojanasakul Y. Stehlik C. Differential splicing of the apoptosis-associated speck like protein containing a caspase recruitment domain (ASC) regulates inflammasomes.J. Inflamm. 2010; 7: 23Google Scholar). However, ASCb activates the inflammasome to a lesser extent as determined by the amount of IL-1β released and cannot form the typical puncta characteristic of canonical inflammasomes, forming instead filamentous aggregates (20Bryan N.B. Dorfleutner A. Kramer S.J. Yun C. Rojanasakul Y. Stehlik C. Differential splicing of the apoptosis-associated speck like protein containing a caspase recruitment domain (ASC) regulates inflammasomes.J. Inflamm. 2010; 7: 23Google Scholar). In contrast, ASCc and ASCd do not colocalize with NLRP3 and cannot generate mature IL-1β, leading to the conclusion that these isoforms are not inflammasome activators. In fact, the release of IL-1β by ASC is diminished in the presence of ASCc, which suggests that the latter acts as an inflammasome inhibitor (20Bryan N.B. Dorfleutner A. Kramer S.J. Yun C. Rojanasakul Y. Stehlik C. Differential splicing of the apoptosis-associated speck like protein containing a caspase recruitment domain (ASC) regulates inflammasomes.J. Inflamm. 2010; 7: 23Google Scholar). No clear effect on inflammasome activity has been identified for ASCd, and thus, the function of this isoform is still unknown (20Bryan N.B. Dorfleutner A. Kramer S.J. Yun C. Rojanasakul Y. Stehlik C. Differential splicing of the apoptosis-associated speck like protein containing a caspase recruitment domain (ASC) regulates inflammasomes.J. Inflamm. 2010; 7: 23Google Scholar). To understand the modulation of inflammasome assembly by the activating isoforms, ASC and ASCb, we have studied the self-association properties of both proteins using several biophysical and biochemical techniques. By multidimensional solution NMR, we obtained the 15N and 13C chemical shifts of ASCb’s polypeptide backbone to compare to previously published data for ASC (22de Alba E. 1H, 15N and 13C backbone and side chain chemical shifts of human ASC (apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a CARD domain).Biomol. NMR Assign. 2007; 1: 135-137Google Scholar), revealing that the PYD and CARD structures of both isoforms are very similar as expected due to the identical amino acid sequence. NMR signal intensity decay resulting from oligomerization was monitored by real-time NMR at the individual residue level for both proteins over a period of 65 h. Based on these studies, we determine that ASC and ASCb follow different kinetics for self-association. Moreover, NMR data indicate that the PYD and CARD of ASC behave differently during self-association, whereas no differences were observed for the two domains in ASCb. Oligomer size distribution was analyzed by dynamic light scattering in ASC and ASCb solutions as a function of time during the self-association process, revealing different tendencies in polydispersity that agree with observations from the cell studies. The effect of protein concentration, pH, and time on the oligomerization processes was studied by size-exclusion chromatography (SEC), showing that ASC has a stronger self-association capability compared with ASCb. Additionally, the characteristics of the macrostructures formed by ASCb were investigated by negative-staining transmission electron microscopy (ns-TEM) and compared with previously reported TEM data for ASC. The analysis of ns-TEM micrographs reveals that ASCb also forms filaments of similar thickness to those formed by ASC; however, ASC tends to form bundles composed of a larger number of stacked filaments. Finally, the impact of linker length on the interaction between ASC or ASCb and the CARD of procaspase-1 was studied in silico by creating structural models via molecular docking. The previously reported 3D NMR structure of ASC revealed that the PYD and CARD domains adopt the six-helix bundle motif common to other death domain folds. The two domains are connected by a 23 amino acid–long linker (10de Alba E. Structure and interdomain dynamics of apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a CARD (ASC).J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 32932-32941Google Scholar). We expect that the structures of the PYD and CARD of ASC and ASCb would be almost identical because the two isoforms only differ in the linker length, and the PYD and CARD of both proteins share 100% amino acid sequence identity (Fig. 2A). To compare structural information of the two isoforms derived from the NMR data, we assigned the 15N and 13C backbone chemical shifts of ASCb (Table S1) and compared this assignment with that reported for ASC (22de Alba E. 1H, 15N and 13C backbone and side chain chemical shifts of human ASC (apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a CARD domain).Biomol. NMR Assign. 2007; 1: 135-137Google Scholar). In protein NMR, the [1H-15N]-HSQC spectrum correlating the amide 1H and 15N chemical shifts of the protein backbone is known as the protein fingerprint because it is unique for each protein (11Diaz-Parga P. de Alba E. Protein interactions of the inflammasome adapter ASC by solution NMR.Methods Enzymol. 2019; 625: 223-252Google Scholar). Figure 2B depicts an overlay of the [1H-15N]-HSQC spectra showing that the signals of the PYD and CARD of ASC and ASCb substantially overlap as expected. The more crowded region of the ASC spectrum around 8.5 ppm (for the 1H chemical shift) reflects the additional signals from the longer, semiflexible linker. The average difference in chemical shifts for 15N and 1H of ASC and ASCb versus the residue number is very small (Fig. 2C), indicating that both PYD and CARD in ASCb are properly folded into the six-helix bundle motif. Amino acids that are close to the linker region in the amino acid sequence or in the 3D structure are expected to show deviations in chemical shifts for both isoforms. This is the case for amino acids H90, Q91, and L112; however, T16 and R33 (ASC numbering) show significant chemical shift variations even though these amino acids are not close to the linker region. We can speculate that the origin of these changes could be related to the oligomerizing properties of ASC and ASCb. In addition, a comparison of the 13Cα and 13Cβ chemical shifts for both isoforms (Fig. S1) indicates that the secondary structure of both proteins is identical, as expected. ASC has a strong tendency to oligomerize and polymerizes forming filaments and filament bundles at neutral pH (12Nambayan R.J.T. Sandin S.I. Quint D.A. Satyadi D.M. de Alba E. The inflammasome adapter ASC assembles into filaments with integral participation of its two death domains, PYD and CARD.J. Biol. Chem. 2019; 294: 439-452Google Scholar). This behavior is a consequence of ASC function as the inflammasome adaptor, which involves self-association and tethering multiple copies of the inflammasome components via protein–protein interactions. It has been reported that ASC self-association is reduced at acidic pH (pH 3.8) and concentration values <200 μM; conditions used for the 3D structure determination of ASC by solution NMR techniques (10de Alba E. Structure and interdomain dynamics of apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a CARD (ASC).J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 32932-32941Google Scholar, 11Diaz-Parga P. de Alba E. Protein interactions of the inflammasome adapter ASC by solution NMR.Methods Enzymol. 2019; 625: 223-252Google Scholar). However, ASC significantly self-associates at concentrations >200 μM even under acidic conditions. As previously reported, ASC self-association can be detected by a decrease of NMR signal intensity with time (10de Alba E. Structure and interdomain dynamics of apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a CARD (ASC).J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 32932-32941Google Scholar). This observation results from the formation of large oligomeric species that are “invisible” in solution NMR due to their slow tumbling rate, hence no longer contributing to the signal arising from the monomeric species (24Sengupta I. Bhate S.H. Das R. Udgaonkar J.B. Salt-mediated oligomerization of the mouse prion protein monitored by real-time NMR.J. Mol. Biol. 2017; 429: 1852-1872Google Scholar, 25Fawzi N.L. Ying J. Torchia D.A. Clore G.M. Kinetics of amyloid β monomer-to-oligomer exchange by NMR relaxation.J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2010; 132: 9948-9951Google Scholar). We have leveraged this behavior to monitor changes in signal intensity upon ASC and ASCb self-association by real-time (RT) NMR. Protein samples are in lyophilized form after purification and start to oligomerize as soon they are dissolved in the NMR buffer. A series of 2D-[1H,15N]-NMR spectra were acquired as a function of time after NMR sample preparation for 65 h. The RT-NMR kinetic experiments were performed on 15N-labeled protein samples at different concentration values (∼300–700 μM) to investigate the influence of protein concentration on the kinetics of self-association. The first 1D projection of the 2D experiment reflects the overall signal intensity of the spectra, which significantly decreases with time (Fig. 3A) for ASC and ASCb due to the formation of high-order oligomers. The slow tumbling rate of these large oligomers renders them “invisible” in NMR, resulting in signal intensity decrease upon protein self-association. However, careful analysis of the intensity decrease with time reveals that ASC oligomerizes faster than ASCb (Fig. 3B). Protein concentration is an important factor prompting polymerization for both ASC and ASCb, as self-association rates are significantly diminished at ∼300 μM versus ∼700 μM (Fig. 3B). ASC oligomerizes slightly faster than ASCb at the lowest concentration, but the difference between the two isoforms is small compared with the kinetics at ∼700 μM. It is important to note that we have not observed signal broadening nor the presence of new signals arising upon ASC or ASCb self-association (Fig. S2). There are several possible explanations for these results: 1) the oligomers formed during the kinetic experiment are already too large to be detected by NMR, 2) intermediate-size oligomers that could give rise to new signals are formed but do not live long enough to be detected. The overall intensity decays were fitted to single- and double-exponential equations (Equations 1 and 2, respectively) to estimate apparent oligomerization rate constants (k1 and k2). It is important to mention that Equations 1 and 2 are logistic functions a priory not related to the underlying self-association mechanism but are particularly useful for comparing the polymerization kinetics of both proteins. Fitting of the NMR intensity decay to a double-exponential versus single-exponential improves for ASC but not for ASCb. This result suggests that ASC oligomerization involves at least two steps with different rate constants. The fitting to a double-exponential results in fast and slow rate constants for ASC: k1ASC = 0.15 ± 0.03 h−1 and k2ASC = 0.04 ± 0.01 h−1, respectively (Table 1). Thus, one kinetic phase in ASC oligomerization is 3.75 times faster than the other assuming other conditions are identical. This result could reflect the fast formation of an initial oligomer (a nucleation step) that continues growing at a slower rate forming a polymer. The overall signal decay for ASC at ∼700 μM reaches 33% of the original intensity at steady-state conditions resulting from the fraction of monomer concentration still present at the end of the kinetic experiment (65 h). Two weeks later, the intensity remains at this same value (Fig. 3C).Table 1Kinetic parameters from logistic Equations 1 and 2Rate constantsProtein isoformASCASCbk1aReported values are averaged and SD obtained from fitting the logistic equations to the RT-NMR data at ∼700 and 500 μΜ for each isoform.

Units for rate constants are in h−1. Open table in a new tab In contrast, the fitting of the ASCb NMR signal intensity decay to a double-exponential does not result in any significant difference compared with a single-exponential fitting. Thus, ASCb appears to oligomerize with a single kinetic phase with an apparent rate constant kASCb = 0.02 ± 0.01 h−1. Interestingly, at the final stage of the kinetic experiment, the remaining fraction of ASCb monomeric species is 18%. The fitting of signal intensity decay for ASC and ASCb (∼700 μM) to the exponential functions includes a baseline value (A1 in Equations 1 and 2) that results in 31% and 18% of residual monomeric population for ASC and ASCb, respectively, in agreement with the experimental data. Several parameters indicative of the goodness of the fit are shown in Table 1.y=A0e−xk+A1(1) y=A0e−xk1+A2e−xk2+A1(2) To study potentially different behaviors of the two death domains in protein polymerization, we have analyzed the signal intensity decay of the two isoforms at the amino acid level. Figure 4A shows, as examples, the fitting of several amino acids located in the PYD and CARD of ASC and ASCb to the exponential equations (Equations 1 and 2). Amino acids in the PYD and CARD of ASC show different behavior, whereas this difference is not observed for ASCb. The k1 and k2 values of individual amino acids plotted versus the residue sequence clearly show that the two death domains of ASC behave differently in the faster step (Fig. 4B). The k1 values of the PYD are larger than those of the CARD: k1avePYD = 0.21 ± 0.04 h−1 and k1aveCARD = 0.12 ± 0.02 h−1 (Table 1). However, the k2 values are similar for both domains: average value, k2avePYD = 0.05 ± 0.02 h−1 and k2aveCARD = 0.02 ± 0.01 h−1 (Table 1). This higher value for k1avePYD versus k1aveCARD suggests that PYD-PYD interactions could drive the first steps in the oligomerization reaction, and that both domains participate equally in subsequent polymerization steps. In contrast, the PYD and CARD domains of ASCb show very similar values of the oligomerization rate constant (k = 0.02 ± 0.01 h−1) (Fig. 4B and Table 1), which points to equivalent participation of both domains in the different steps of the polymerization reaction. This rate constant is slower than the slower rate constant for ASC self-association (k2), again indicating that ASCb polymerizes at a slower rate compared with ASC. The monoexponential behavior in ASCb could be explained by an initial nucleation step and subsequent polymerization with analogous rate constants. The oligomerization of ASC is a complex process as shown by our recent studies combining NMR techniques and ns-TEM, indicating that ASC dimers are the building blocks of ASC filaments and that the latter tend to form bundles comprising laterally stacked filaments. The ASC dimer involves homotypic interactions between the PYDs and CARDs of the two protomers. PYD and CARD domains have several protein–protein interacting regions that facilitate further association and polymerization. The exponential Equations 1 and 2 used for comparing the self-association behavior of ASC and ASCb report on the presence of different kinetic phases and allow the identification of similitudes and differences in the self-association process of the individual domains; however, these equations are not necessarily connected to the oligomerization kinetic mechanisms. We have attempted to propose a simple kinetic model for ASC and ASCb self-association based on previously reported models for protein oligomerization. The oligomerization mechanisms of numerous protein systems have been studied in depth using different kinetic models of polymerization (26Kamihira M. Naito A. Tuzi S. Nosaka A.Y. Saitô H.

This study used an online survey tool to identify and examine risk factors relating to swimming ability, beach visitation characteristics and behaviour, and beach safety knowledge of the Australian Southern Asian community to assist in the development of future beach safety interventions. Data was obtained through 249 online and in-person surveys of people aged > 18 years. Most respondents reported poor swimming ability (80%), often swam in in the absence of lifeguards (77%), did not understand the rip current hazard (58%), but reported that they entered the water (76%) when visiting beaches. Close to one-quarter (28%) had not heard, or didn't know the purpose, of the red and yellow beach flags, which identify lifeguard supervised areas on Australian beaches. Length of time living in Australia is an important beach safety consideration for this community, with minimal differences in terms of gender and age. Those who have lived < 10 years in Australia visit beaches more frequently and are less likely to have participated in swimming lessons, be able to swim, heard of the flags or swim between them, understand rip currents, or have participated in a beach safety program. Very few (3%) respondents received beach safety information from within their own community. The importance of beach safety education and swimming lessons within the Southern Asian community should be prioritised for new and recent migrants to Australia."
https://openalex.org/W4205706173,"Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) is a serious dose-limiting side effect of several first-line chemotherapeutic agents including paclitaxel, oxaliplatin and bortezomib, for which no predictive marker is currently available. We have previously shown that mitochondrial dysfunction is associated with the development and maintenance of CIPN. The aim of this study was to evaluate the potential use of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) levels and complex I enzyme activity as blood biomarkers for CIPN. Real-time qPCR was used to measure mtDNA levels in whole blood collected from chemotherapy- and vehicle-treated rats at three key time-points of pain-like behaviour: prior to pain development, at the peak of mechanical hypersensitivity and at resolution of pain-like behaviour. Systemic oxaliplatin significantly increased mtDNA levels in whole blood prior to pain development. Furthermore, paclitaxel- and bortezomib-treated animals displayed significantly higher levels of mtDNA at the peak of mechanical hypersensitivity. Mitochondrial complex I activity in whole blood was assessed with an ELISA-based Complex I Enzyme Activity Dipstick Assay. Complex I activity was not altered by any of the three chemotherapeutic agents, either prior to or during pain-like behaviour. These data demonstrate that blood levels of mtDNA are altered after systemic administration of chemotherapy. Oxaliplatin, in particular, is associated with higher mtDNA levels before animals show any pain-like behaviour, thus suggesting a potential role for circulating mtDNA levels as non-invasive predictive biomarker for CIPN."

In addition to their known anticoagulants activity this potential inhibition could have an additional therapeutic effect on patients with COVID-19 disease. In this study we examined the binding of the Apixaban, Betrixaban and Rivaroxaban to the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro with the use of the MicroScale Thermophoresis technique. Our results indicate that the experimentally measured binding affinity is weak and the therapeutic effect due to the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro inhibition is rather negligible."
https://openalex.org/W4206638801,"Amyloid proteins are widespread in nature both as pathological species involved in several diseases and as functional entities that can provide protection and storage for the organism. Lipids have been found in amyloid deposits from various amyloid diseases and have been shown to strongly affect the formation and structure of both pathological and functional amyloid proteins. Here, we investigate how fibrillation of the functional amyloid FapC from Pseudomonas is affected by two lysolipids, the zwitterionic lipid 1-myristoyl-2-hydroxy-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine and the anionic lipid 1-myristoyl-2-hydroxy-sn-glycero-3-phospho-(1'-rac-glycerol) (LPG). Small-angle X-ray scattering, circular dichroism, dynamic light scattering, and thioflavin T fluorescence measurements were performed simultaneously on the same sample to ensure reproducibility and allow a multimethod integrated analysis. We found that LPG strongly induces fibrillation around its critical micelle concentration (cmc) by promoting formation of large structures, which mature via accumulation of intermediate fibril structures with a large cross section. At concentrations above its cmc, LPG strongly inhibits fibrillation by locking FapC in a core-shell complex. In contrast, lipid 1-myristoyl-2-hydroxy-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine induces fibrillation at concentrations above its cmc, not via strong interactions with FapC but by being incorporated during fibrillation and likely stabilizing the fibrillation nucleus to reduce the lag phase. Finally, we show that LPG is not incorporated into the fibril during assembly but rather can coat the final fibril. We conclude that lipids affect both the mechanism and outcome of fibrillation of functional amyloid, highlighting a role for lipid concentration and composition in the onset and mechanism of fibrillation in vivo."

Drawing on a laboratory experiment, we propose that individuals high in moral commitment are less likely to engage in corrupt behaviors and prefer foregoing financial benefits. Specifically, we posit that individuals refrain from corruption (i) the more they endorse integrity (incorruptibility) as a protected value and (ii) the higher their level of Honesty-Humility. The results of a two-step experiment largely support our expectations: people who treat compromises to integrity as unacceptable were less willing to accept bribes, and Honesty-Humility decreased bribe-giving. The findings are robust to demographic variables (e.g., age, gender, cultural background) and additional personal characteristics (e.g., risk tolerance, dispositional greed) and have important implications for ongoing theory-building efforts and business practice."
https://openalex.org/W4205999392,"To examine which factors affect the performance of technology business incubators in China, the present study proposes an entrepreneurial ecosystem framework with four key areas, i.e., people, technology, capital, and infrastructure. We then assess this framework using a three-year panel data set of 857 national-level technology business incubators in 33 major cities from 28 provinces in China, from 2015 to 2017. We utilize factor analysis to downsize dozens of characteristics of these technology business incubators into seven factors related to the four proposed areas. Panel regression model results show that four of the seven factors related to three areas of the entrepreneurial ecosystem, namely people, technology, and capital areas, have statistically significant associations with an incubator's performance when applied to the overall national data set. Further, seven factors related to all four areas have various statistically significant associations with an incubator's performance in five major regional data set. In particular, a technology related factor has a consistently statistically significant association with the performance of the incubator in both national model and the five regional models, as we expected."
https://openalex.org/W4206231713,"Purpose To identify the effects of superoxide dismutase (SOD)3 on diabetes mellitus (DM)-induced retinal changes in a diabetic rat model. Methods Diabetic models were established by a single intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin (STZ) in Sprague-Dawley rats. After purification of the recombinant SOD3, intravitreal injection of SOD3 was performed at the time of STZ injection, and 1 and 2 weeks following STZ injection. Scotopic and photopic electroretinography (ERG) were recorded. Immunofluorescence staining with ɑ-smooth muscle actin (SMA), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), pigment epithelium-derived factor (PEDF), Flt1, recoverin, parvalbumin, extracellular superoxide dismutase (SOD3), 8-Hydroxy-2’deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) and tumor necrosis factor-ɑ (TNF-ɑ) were evaluated. Results In the scotopic ERG, the diabetic group showed reduced a- and b-wave amplitudes compared with the control group. In the photopic ERG, b-wave amplitude showed significant ( p &lt; 0.0005) reduction at 8 weeks following DM induction. However, the trend of a- and b-wave reduction was not evident in the SOD3 treated group. GFAP, Flt1, 8-OHdG and TNF-ɑ immunoreactivity were increased, and ɑ-SMA, PEDF and SOD3 immunoreactivity were decreased in the diabetic retina. The immunoreactivity of these markers was partially recovered in the SOD3 treated group. Parvalbumin expression was not decreased in the SOD3 treated group. In the diabetic retinas, the immunoreactivity of recoverin was weakly detected in both of the inner nuclear layer and inner plexiform layer compared to the control group but not in the SOD3 treated group. Conclusions SOD3 treatment attenuated the loss of a/b-wave amplitudes in the diabetic rats, which was consistent with the immunohistochemical evaluation. We also suggest that in rod-dominant rodents, the use of blue on green photopic negative response (PhNR) is effective in measuring the inner retinal function in animal models of diabetic retinopathy. SOD3 treatment ameliorated the retinal Müller cell activation in diabetic rats and pericyte dysfunction. These results suggested that SOD3 exerted protective effects on the development of diabetic retinopathy."
https://openalex.org/W4206370728,"The glucocorticoid (GC) receptor (GR) is essential for normal development and in the initiation of inflammation. Healthy GRdim/dim mice with reduced dimerization propensity due to a point mutation (A465T) at the dimer interface of the GR DNA-binding domain (DBD) (here GRD/D) have previously helped to define the functions of GR monomers and dimers. Since GRD/D retains residual dimerization capacity, here we generated the dimer-nullifying double mutant GRD+L/D+L mice, featuring an additional mutation (I634A) in the ligand-binding domain (LBD) of GR. These mice are perinatally lethal, as are GRL/L mice (these mice have the I634A mutation but not the A465T mutation), displaying improper lung and skin formation. Using embryonic fibroblasts, high and low doses of dexamethasone (Dex), nuclear translocation assays, RNAseq, dimerization assays, and ligand-binding assays (and Kd values), we found that the lethal phenotype in these mice is due to insufficient ligand binding. These data suggest there is some correlation between GR dimerization potential and ligand affinity. We conclude that even a mutation as subtle as I634A, at a position not directly involved in ligand interactions sensu stricto, can still influence ligand binding and have a lethal outcome."
https://openalex.org/W4206428308,"The complex correlation between regions caused by the externality of air pollution increases the difficulty of its governance. Therefore, analysis of the spatio-temporal network of air pollution (STN-AP) holds great significance for the cross-regional coordinated governance of air pollution. Although the spatio-temporal distribution of air pollution has been analyzed, the structural characteristics of the STN-AP still need to be clarified. The STN-AP in the Yangtze River Delta urban agglomeration (YRDUA) is constructed based on the improved gravity model and is visualized by UCINET with data from 2012 to 2019. Then, its overall-individual-clustering characteristics are analyzed through social network analysis (SNA) method. The results show that the STN-AP in the YRDUA was overall stable, and the correlation level gradually improved. The centrality of every individual city is different in the STN-AP, which reveals the different state of their interactive mechanism. The STN-AP could be subdivided into the receptive block, overflow block, bidirectional block and intermediary block. Shanghai, Suzhou, Hangzhou and Wuxi could be key cities with an all above degree centrality, betweenness centrality and closeness centrality and located in the overflow block of the STN-AP. This showed that these cities had a greater impact on the STN-AP and caused a more pronounced air pollution spillovers. The influencing factors of the spatial correlation of air pollution are further determined through the quadratic assignment procedure (QAP) method. Among all factors, geographical proximity has the strongest impact and deserves to be paid attention in order to prevent the cross-regional overflow of air pollution. Furthermore, several suggestions are proposed to promote coordinated governance of air pollution in the YRDUA."

https://openalex.org/W4205160708,"Although diabetes normally causes an elevation of cholesterol biosynthesis and induces hypercholesterolemia in animals and human, the mechanism linking diabetes to the dysregulation of cholesterol biosynthesis in the liver is not fully understood. As liver peroxisomal β-oxidation is induced in the diabetic state and peroxisomal oxidation of fatty acids generates free acetate, we hypothesized that peroxisomal β-oxidation might play a role in liver cholesterol biosynthesis in diabetes. Here, we used erucic acid, a specific substrate for peroxisomal β-oxidation, and 10,12-tricosadiynoic acid, a specific inhibitor for peroxisomal β-oxidation, to specifically induce and suppress peroxisomal β-oxidation. Our results suggested that induction of peroxisomal β-oxidation increased liver cholesterol biosynthesis in streptozotocin-induced diabetic mice. We found that excessive oxidation of fatty acids by peroxisomes generated considerable free acetate in the liver, which was used as a precursor for cholesterol biosynthesis. In addition, we show that specific inhibition of peroxisomal β-oxidation decreased cholesterol biosynthesis by reducing acetate formation in the liver in diabetic mice, demonstrating a crosstalk between peroxisomal β-oxidation and cholesterol biosynthesis. Based on these results, we propose that induction of peroxisomal β-oxidation serves as a mechanism for a fatty acid-induced upregulation in cholesterol biosynthesis and also plays a role in diabetes-induced hypercholesterolemia."
https://openalex.org/W4205202733,"Bovine tuberculosis (bTB) caused by Mycobacterium (M.) bovis and M. caprae is a transmissible disease of livestock, notifiable to the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE). BTB particularly affects cattle and small ruminants and can be transmitted to humans thereby posing a significant threat to veterinary and public health worldwide. M. bovis is the principal cause of bTB in Algeria. In order to better understand the route of spreading and elaborate an eradication program, isolation and characterization of mycobacteria from Algerian cattle was performed. Sixty strains belonging to the M. tuberculosis complex were analyzed by spoligotyping, thereof 42 by 19-locus-MIRU-VNTR-typing. Spoligotyping revealed 16 distinguishable patterns (Hunter-Gaston discriminatory index [HGDI] of 0.8294), with types SB0120 (n = 20) and SB0121 (n = 13) being the most frequent patterns, representing 55% of the strains. Analyses based on 19-locus-MIRU-VNTR yielded 32 different profiles, five clusters and one orphan pattern, showing higher discriminatory power (HGDI = 0.9779) than spoligotyping. Seven VNTR-loci [VNTR 577 (alias ETR C), 2163b (QU11b), 2165 (ETR A), 2461 (ETR B), 3007 (MIRU 27), 2163a (QUB11a) and 3232 (QUB 3232)] were the most discriminative loci (HGDI ˃ 0.50). In conclusion, 19-locus-MIRU-VNTR yielded more information than spoligotyping concerning molecular differentiation of strains and better supports the elucidation of transmission routes of M. bovis between Algerian cattle herds."
https://openalex.org/W4206573738,"Healthcare systems have reached a critical point regarding the question of whether biosimilar substitution should become common practice. To move the discussion forward, the study objective was to investigate the views of experts from medicines agencies and the pharmaceutical industry on the science underpinning interchangeability of biosimilars. We conducted an empirical qualitative study using semi-structured interviews informed by a cross-disciplinary approach encompassing regulatory science, law, and pharmaceutical policy. In total 25 individuals with experience within biologics participated during September 2018–August 2019. Eight participants were EU national medicines authority regulators, and 17 had pharmaceutical industry background: five from two originator-only companies, four from two companies with both biosimilar and originator products, and eight from seven biosimilar-only companies. Two analysts independently conducted inductive content analysis, resulting in data-driven themes capturing the meaning of the data. The participants reported that interchangeability was more than a scientific question of likeness between biosimilar and reference products: it also pertained to regulatory practices and trust. Participants were overall confident in the science behind exchanging biosimilar products for the reference products via switching, i.e., with physician involvement. However, their opinions differed regarding the scientific risk associated with biosimilar substitution, i.e., without physician involvement. Almost all participants saw no need for additional scientific data to support substitution. Moreover, the participants did not believe that switching studies, as required in the US, were appropriate for obtaining scientific certainty due to their small size. It is unclear why biosimilar switching is viewed as scientifically safer than substitution; therefore, we expect greater policy debate on biosimilar substitution in the near future. We urge European and UK policymakers and regulators to clarify their visions for biosimilar substitution; the positions of these two frontrunners are likely to influence other jurisdictions on the future of biosimilar use."
https://openalex.org/W4206778305,"Skeletal muscle myosin (SkM) has been shown to possess procoagulant activity; however, the mechanisms of this coagulation-enhancing activity involving plasma coagulation pathways and factors are incompletely understood. Here, we discovered direct interactions between immobilized SkM and coagulation factor XI (FXI) using biolayer interferometry (Kd = 0.2 nM). In contrast, we show that prekallikrein, a FXI homolog, did not bind to SkM, reflecting the specificity of SkM for FXI binding. We also found that the anti-FXI monoclonal antibody, mAb 1A6, which recognizes the Apple (A) 3 domain of FXI, potently inhibited binding of FXI to immobilized SkM, implying that SkM binds FXI A3 domain. In addition, we show that SkM enhanced FXI activation by thrombin in a concentration-dependent manner. We further used recombinant FXI chimeric proteins in which each of the four A domains of the heavy chain (designated A1 through A4) was individually replaced with the corresponding A domain from prekallikrein to investigate SkM-mediated enhancement of thrombin-induced FXI activation. These results indicated that activation of two FXI chimeras with substitutions of either the A3 domains or A4 domains was not enhanced by SkM, whereas substitution of the A2 domain did not reduce the thrombin-induced activation compared with wildtype FXI. These data strongly suggest that functional interaction sites on FXI for SkM involve the A3 and A4 domains. Thus, this study is the first to reveal and support the novel intrinsic blood coagulation pathway concept that the procoagulant mechanisms of SkM include FXI binding and enhancement of FXI activation by thrombin."

https://openalex.org/W4205376299,"Knee osteoarthritis (KOA) is a leading cause of knee pain and disability due to irreversible cartilage degeneration. Previous studies have not identified modifiable risk factors for KOA. In this preliminary cross-sectional study, we aimed to test the following hypotheses: individuals with severe KOA would have a significantly lower quadriceps rate of force development (RFD) than individuals with early KOA, and the decrease in quadriceps RFD would be greater than the decrease in maximum quadriceps strength in individuals with severe KOA. The maximum isometric strength of the quadriceps was assessed in individuals with mild (Kellgren and Lawrence [K&L] grade 1-2) and severe KOA (K&L grade 3-4) using a handheld dynamometer. The RFD was analyzed at 200 ms from torque onset and normalized to the body mass and maximum voluntary isometric contraction torque. To test whether the quadriceps RFD was lowered and whether the lower in the quadriceps RFD was greater than the lower in maximum quadriceps strength in individuals with severe knee OA, the Mann-Whitney U-test and analysis of covariance were performed, respectively. The effect size (ES) based on Hedges' g with a 95% confidence interval (CI) was calculated for the quadriceps RFD and maximum quadriceps strength. Sixty-six participants were analyzed. Individuals with severe KOA displayed significantly lower quadriceps RFD (p = 0.009), the lower being greater than the lower in maximum quadriceps strength (between-group difference, ES: 0.88, -1.07 vs. 0.06, -0.22). Our results suggest that a decreased quadriceps RFD is a modifiable risk factor for progressive KOA. Our finding could help in the early detection and prevention of severe KOA."
https://openalex.org/W4205609101,"Major efforts worldwide have been made to provide balanced Mental Health (MH) care. Any integrated MH ecosystem includes hospital and community-based care, highlighting the role of outpatient care in reducing relapses and readmissions. This study aimed (i) to identify potential expert-based causal relationships between inpatient and outpatient care variables, (ii) to assess them by using statistical procedures, and finally (iii) to assess the potential impact of a specific policy enhancing the MH care balance on real ecosystem performance. Causal relationships (Bayesian network) between inpatient and outpatient care variables were defined by expert knowledge and confirmed by using multivariate linear regression (generalized least squares). Based on the Bayesian network and regression results, a decision support system that combines data envelopment analysis, Monte Carlo simulation and fuzzy inference was used to assess the potential impact of the designed policy. As expected, there were strong statistical relationships between outpatient and inpatient care variables, which preliminarily confirmed their potential and a priori causal nature. The global impact of the proposed policy on the ecosystem was positive in terms of efficiency assessment, stability and entropy. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that formalized expert-based causal relationships between inpatient and outpatient care variables. These relationships, structured by a Bayesian network, can be used for designing evidence-informed policies trying to balance MH care provision. By integrating causal models and statistical analysis, decision support systems are useful tools to support evidence-informed planning and decision making, as they allow us to predict the potential impact of specific policies on the ecosystem prior to its real application, reducing the risk and considering the population's needs and scientific findings."
https://openalex.org/W4206337630,"The expression of non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) is dysregulated in human cancers. The transcribed ultraconserved regions (T-UCRs) express long ncRNAs involved in human carcinogenesis. T-UCRs are non-coding genomic sequence that are 100% conserved across humans, rats and mice. Conservation of genomic sequences across species intrinsically implies an essential functional role and so we considered the expression of T-UCRs in lung cancer. Using a custom microarray we analyzed the global expression of T-UCRs. Among these T-UCRs, the greatest variation was observed for antisense ultraconserved element 83 (uc.83-), which was upregulated in human lung cancer tissues compared with adjacent non cancerous tissues. Even though uc.83- is located within the long intergenic non-protein coding RNA 1876 (LINC01876) gene, we found that the transcribed uc.83- is expressed independently of LINC01876 and was cloned as a 1143-bp RNA gene. In this study, functional analysis confirmed important effects of uc.83- on genes involved in cell growth of human cells. siRNA against uc.83- decreased the growth of lung cancer cells while the upregulation through a vector overexpressing the uc.83- RNA increased cell proliferation. We also show the oncogenic function of uc.83- is mediated by the phosphorylation of AKT and ERK 1/2, two important biomarkers of lung cancer cell proliferation. Based on our findings, inhibition against uc.83- could be a future therapeutic treatment for NSCLC to achieve simultaneous blockade of pathways involved in lung carcinogenesis."

Casein glycomacropeptide (CGMP) is a natural peptide released in whey during cheese making by the action of the enzyme chymosin. Because CGMP in its pure form does not contain Phe, it is nutritionally suitable as a supplement in the diet for PKU when enriched with specific AAs. Lacprodan® CGMP-20 (= CGMP) used in this study contained only trace amounts of Phe due to minor presence of other proteins/peptides.The aims were to address the following questions in a classical PKU mouse model: Study 1, off diet: Can pure CGMP or CGMP supplemented with Large Neutral Amino Acids (LNAA) as a supplement to normal diet significantly lower the content of Phe in the brain compared to a control group on normal diet, and does supplementation of selected LNAA results in significant lower brain Phe level?. Study 2, on diet: Does a combination of CGMP, essential (non-Phe) EAAs and LP diet, provide similar plasma and brain Phe levels, growth and behavioral skills as a formula which alone consist of FSAA, with a similar composition?.45 female mice homozygous for the Pahenu2 mutation were treated for 12 weeks in five different groups; G1(N-CGMP), fed on Normal (N) casein diet (75%) in combination with CGMP (25%); G2 (N-CGMP-LNAA), fed on Normal (N) casein diet (75%) in combination with CGMP (19,7%) and selected LNAA (5,3% Leu, Tyr and Trp); G3 (N), fed on normal casein diet (100%); G4 (CGMP-EAA-LP), fed on CGMP (70,4%) in combination with essential AA (19,6%) and LP diet; G5 (FSAA-LP), fed on FSAA (100%) and LP diet. The following parameters were measured during the treatment period: Plasma AA profiles including Phe and Tyr, growth, food and water intake and number of teeth cut. At the end of the treatment period, a body scan (fat and lean body mass) and a behavioral test (Barnes Maze) were performed. Finally, the brains were examined for content of Phe, Tyr, Trp, dopamine (DA), 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC), serotonin (5-HT) and 5-hydroxyindole-acetic acid (5-HIAA), and the bone density and bone mineral content were determined by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry.Study 1: Mice off diet supplemented with CGMP (G1 (N-CGMP)) or supplemented with CGMP in combination with LNAA (G2 (N-CGMP-LNAA)) had significantly lower Phe in plasma and in the brain compared to mice fed only casein (G3 (N)). Extra LNAA (Tyr, Trp and Leu) to CGMP did not have any significant impact on Phe levels in the plasma and brain, but an increase in serotonin was measured in the brain of G2 mice compared to G1. Study 2: PKU mice fed with mixture of CGMP and EAA as supplement to LP diet (G4 (CGMP-EAA-LP)) demonstrated lower plasma-Phe levels but similar brain- Phe levels and growth as mice fed on an almost identical combination of FSAA (G5 (FSAA-LP)).CGMP can be a relevant supplement for the treatment of PKU."
https://openalex.org/W4207048140,"Autophagy is a lysosomal degradation pathway for the removal of damaged and superfluous cytoplasmic material. This is achieved by the sequestration of this cargo material within double-membrane vesicles termed autophagosomes. Autophagosome formation is mediated by the conserved autophagy machinery. In selective autophagy, this machinery including the transmembrane protein Atg9 is recruited to specific cargo material via cargo receptors and the Atg11/FIP200 scaffold protein. The molecular details of the interaction between Atg11 and Atg9 are unclear, and it is still unknown how the recruitment of Atg9 is regulated. Here we employ NMR spectroscopy of the N-terminal disordered domain of Atg9 (Atg9-NTD) to map its interaction with Atg11 revealing that it involves two short peptides both containing a PLF motif. We show that the Atg9-NTD binds to Atg11 with an affinity of about 1 μM and that both PLF motifs contribute to the interaction. Mutation of the PLF motifs abolishes the interaction of the Atg9-NTD with Atg11, reduces the recruitment of Atg9 to the precursor aminopeptidase 1 (prApe1) cargo, and blocks prApe1 transport into the vacuole by the selective autophagy-like cytoplasm-to-vacuole (Cvt) targeting pathway while not affecting bulk autophagy. Our results provide mechanistic insights into the interaction of the Atg11 scaffold with the Atg9 transmembrane protein in selective autophagy and suggest a model where only clustered Atg11 when bound to the prApe1 cargo is able to efficiently recruit Atg9 vesicles."
https://openalex.org/W4225469020,"The mutation risk of a DNA locus depends on its oligonucleotide context. In turn, mutability of oligonucleotides varies across individuals, due to exposure to mutagenic agents or due to variable efficiency and/or accuracy of DNA repair. Such variability is captured by mutational signatures, a mathematical construct obtained by a deconvolution of mutation frequency spectra across individuals. There is a need to enhance methods for inferring mutational signatures to make better use of sparse mutation data (e.g., resulting from exome sequencing of cancers), to facilitate insight into underlying biological mechanisms, and to provide more accurate mutation rate baselines for inferring positive and negative selection. We propose a conceptualization of mutational signatures that represents oligonucleotides via descriptors of DNA conformation: base pair, base pair step, and minor groove width parameters. We demonstrate how such DNA structural parameters can accurately predict mutation occurrence due to DNA repair failures or due to exposure to diverse mutagens such as radiation, chemical exposure, and the APOBEC cytosine deaminase enzymes. Furthermore, the mutation frequency of DNA oligomers classed by structural features can accurately capture systematic variability in mutagenesis of >1,000 tumors originating from diverse human tissues. A nonnegative matrix factorization was applied to mutation spectra stratified by DNA structural features, thereby extracting novel mutational signatures. Moreover, many of the known trinucleotide signatures were associated with an additional spectrum in the DNA structural descriptor space, which may aid interpretation and provide mechanistic insight. Overall, we suggest that the power of DNA sequence motif-based mutational signature analysis can be enhanced by drawing on DNA shape features."

Our detection rule is based on the ratio of log-likelihoods estimated by the dynamic linear model, i.e. the ratio of log-likelihood in our model to that in an over-dispersed model that we will call the NULL model. Using the Yahoo S5 data set and the Numenta Anomaly Benchmark data set, publicly available and commonly used benchmark data sets, we find that our method achieves better or comparable performance compared to the existing methods. The result implies that it is essential in time series anomaly detection to incorporate the specific information on time series data into the model. In addition, we apply the proposed method to unlabeled Web time series data, specifically, daily page view and average session duration data on an electronic commerce site that deals in insurance goods to show the applicability of our method to unlabeled real-world data. We find that the increase in page view caused by e-mail newsletter deliveries is less likely to contribute to completing an insurance contract. The result also suggests the importance of the simultaneous monitoring of more than one time series."
https://openalex.org/W3179612719,"Echo intensity (EI) is a novel tool for assessing muscle quality. EI has traditionally been reported as the mean of the pixel histogram, with 0 and 255 arbitrary units (A.U.) representing excellent and poor muscle quality, respectively. Recent work conducted in youth and younger and older adults suggested that analyzing specific EI bands, rather than the mean, may provide unique insights into the effectiveness of exercise and rehabilitation interventions. As our previous work showed deterioration of muscle quality after knee joint immobilization, we sought to investigate whether the increase in EI following disuse was limited to specific EI bands. Thirteen females (age = 21 yrs) underwent two weeks of left knee immobilization and ambulated via crutches. B-mode ultrasonography was utilized to obtain images of the immobilized vastus lateralis. The percentage of the total number of pixels within bands of 0-50, 51-100, 101-150, 151-200, and 201-255 A.U. was examined before and after immobilization. We also sought to determine if further subdividing the histogram into 25 A.U. bands (i.e., 0-25, 26-50, etc.) would be a more sensitive methodological approach. Immobilization resulted in a decrease in the percentage of pixels within the 0-50 A.U. band (-3.11 ± 3.98%), but an increase in the 101-150 A.U. (2.94 ± 2.64%) and 151-200 A.U. (0.93 ± 1.42%) bands. Analyses of variance on the change scores indicated that these differences were large and significant (%EI0-50 vs. %EI101-150: p < .001, d = 1.243); %EI0-50 vs. %EI151-200: p = .043, d = 0.831). The effect size for the %EI51-100 versus %EI101-150 comparison was medium/large (d = 0.762), but not statistically significant (p = .085). Further analysis of the 25 A.U. bands indicated that the percentage of pixels within the 25-50 A.U. band decreased (-2.97 ± 3.64%), whereas the 101-125 (1.62 ± 1.47%) and 126-150 A.U. (1.18 ± 1.07%) bands increased. Comparison of the 50 A.U. and 25 A.U. band methods found that 25 A.U. bands offer little additional insight. Though studies are needed to ascertain the factors that may influence specific bands, changes in EI during muscle disuse are not homogeneous across the pixel histogram. We encourage investigators to think critically about the robustness of data obtained from EI histograms, rather than simply reporting the EImean value, in muscle quality research."
https://openalex.org/W4205381477,"Erythromycin resistance methyltransferases (Erms) confer resistance to macrolide, lincosamide, and streptogramin antibiotics in Gram-positive bacteria and mycobacteria. Although structural information for ErmAM, ErmC, and ErmE exists from Gram-positive bacteria, little is known about the Erms in mycobacteria, as there are limited biochemical data and no structures available. Here, we present crystal structures of Erm38 from Mycobacterium smegmatis in apoprotein and cofactor-bound forms. Based on structural analysis and mutagenesis, we identified several catalytically critical, positively charged residues at a putative RNA-binding site. We found that mutation of any of these sites is sufficient to abolish methylation activity, whereas the corresponding RNA-binding affinity of Erm38 remains unchanged. The methylation reaction thus appears to require a precise ensemble of amino acids to accurately position the RNA substrate, such that the target nucleotide can be methylated. In addition, we computationally constructed a model of Erm38 in complex with a 32-mer RNA substrate. This model shows the RNA substrate stably bound to Erm38 by a patch of positively charged residues. Furthermore, a π-π stacking interaction between a key aromatic residue of Erm38 and a target adenine of the RNA substrate forms a critical interaction needed for methylation. Taken together, these data provide valuable insights into Erm-RNA interactions, which will aid subsequent structure-based drug design efforts."
https://openalex.org/W4206487540,"The global pandemic of COVID-19 revealed the dynamic heterogeneity in how individuals respond to infection risks, government orders, and community-specific social norms. Here we demonstrate how both individual observation and social learning are likely to shape behavioral, and therefore epidemiological, dynamics over time. Efforts to delay and reduce infections can compromise their own success, especially when disease risk and social learning interact within sub-populations, as when people observe others who are (a) infected and/or (b) socially distancing to protect themselves from infection. Simulating socially-learning agents who observe effects of a contagious virus, our modelling results are consistent with with 2020 data on mask-wearing in the U.S. and also concur with general observations of cohort induced differences in reactions to public health recommendations. We show how shifting reliance on types of learning affect the course of an outbreak, and could therefore factor into policy-based interventions incorporating age-based cohort differences in response behavior."
https://openalex.org/W4206607074,"Limitations in laboratory diagnostic capacity impact population surveillance of COVID-19. It is currently unknown whether participatory surveillance tools for COVID-19 correspond to government-reported case trends longitudinally and if it can be used as an adjunct to laboratory testing. The primary objective of this study was to determine whether self-reported COVID-19-like illness reflected laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 case trends in Ontario Canada.We retrospectively analyzed longitudinal self-reported symptoms data collected using an online tool-Outbreaks Near Me (ONM)-from April 20th, 2020, to March 7th, 2021 in Ontario, Canada. We measured the correlation between COVID-like illness among respondents and the weekly number of PCR-confirmed COVID-19 cases and provincial test positivity. We explored contemporaneous changes in other respiratory viruses, as well as the demographic characteristics of respondents to provide context for our findings.Between 3,849-11,185 individuals responded to the symptom survey each week. No correlations were seen been self-reported CLI and either cases or test positivity. Strong positive correlations were seen between CLI and both cases and test positivity before a previously documented rise in rhinovirus/enterovirus in fall 2020. Compared to participatory surveillance respondents, a higher proportion of COVID-19 cases in Ontario consistently came from low-income, racialized and immigrant areas of the province- these groups were less well represented among survey respondents.Although digital surveillance systems are low-cost tools that have been useful to signal the onset of viral outbreaks, in this longitudinal comparison of self-reported COVID-like illness to Ontario COVID-19 case data we did not find this to be the case. Seasonal respiratory virus transmission and population coverage may explain this discrepancy."
https://openalex.org/W4206649514,"The management of myeloma in the elderly is shifting its focus towards reducing the risk of under-treating fit patients and the risk of over-treating frail patients. Frailty assessment is required in this patient group in order to individualise treatment decisions. In addition to the proven prognostic values of the International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) frailty score and the revised Myeloma Co-morbidity Index (R-MCI), a new easy-to-use frailty-based risk profile score (high-risk (i.e. frail), medium risk (i.e. intermediate-fitness) and low-risk (i.e. fit)) named Myeloma Risk Profile (MRP) was shown to be predictive of survival in the clinical trial setting. In this retrospective real-world study, we set out to evaluate the frailty characteristics and clinical outcomes according to the different MRP scoring algorithm categories (frail vs. intermediate vs fit), in a high risk cohort of elderly newly diagnosed myeloma patients treated with the fixed-duration triplet therapy VCD (bortezomib with cyclophosphamide and dexamethasone). Clinical outcomes included: reason for treatment discontinuation, overall response rate (ORR), overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), and adverse events (AEs). Out of 100 patients, 62 were frail, 27 were intermediate and 11 were fit, according to MRP scores. To enable meaningful comparisons between comparable numbers, subgroups analyses for ORR, OS, PFS, and AEs focused on frail (n = 62) versus intermediate or fit (n = 38) patients. The proportion of patients in each subgroup who were able to complete the planned course of treatment was (frail: 43.5% vs. intermediate or fit: 55.3%). A higher proportion in the frail subgroup discontinued therapy due to progressive disease (19.4% vs. 2.6%). Discontinuation due to toxicity was comparable across subgroups (14.5% vs. 15.8%), ORR in the total cohort was 75%, and this was comparable between subgroups (frail: 74.2% vs. intermediate or fit: 76.3%). There was a trend for a shorter median OS in the frail subgroup but without a statistical significance: (frail vs. intermediate or fit): (46 months vs. not reached, HR: 1.94, 95% CI 0.89-4.2, p = 0.094). There was no difference in median PFS between subgroups: (frail vs. intermediate or fit): (11.8 vs. 9.9 months, HR: 0.99, 95% CI: 0.61-1.61, P = 0.982). This cohort demonstrated a higher incidence rate of AEs in frail patients compared to those in the intermediate or fit group: patients with at least one any grade toxicity (85.5% vs. 71.1%), patients with at least one ≥G3 AE (37.1% vs. 21.1%). In conclusion, our study is to the first to evaluate clinical outcomes according to MRP in a high risk real-world cohort of patients treated exclusively with the proteasome inhibitor-based VCD therapy. Our study demonstrated a trend for worse OS in addition to worse AE outcomes in the frail group, but no difference in PFS with this fixed-duration therapy. MRP is an easy-to-use tool in clinical practice; its prognostic value was validated in the real-world in a large cohort of patients from the Danish Registry. Further evaluation of MRP in the real-world when continuous therapies are used, can further support the generalisability of its prognostic value in elderly myeloma patients."
https://openalex.org/W4205356420,"Heart failure is a leading cause of hospitalizations and mortality worldwide. Heart failure with a preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) represents a significant clinical challenge due to the lack of available treatment modalities for patients diagnosed with HFpEF. One symptom of HFpEF is impaired diastolic function that is associated with increases in left ventricular stiffness. Increases in myocardial fibrillar collagen content is one factor contributing to increases in myocardial stiffness. Cardiac fibroblasts are the primary cell type that produce fibrillar collagen in the heart. However, relatively little is known regarding phenotypic changes in cardiac fibroblasts in HFpEF myocardium. In the current study, cardiac fibroblasts were established from left ventricular epicardial biopsies obtained from patients undergoing cardiovascular interventions and divided into three categories: Referent control, hypertension without a heart failure designation (HTN (-) HFpEF), and hypertension with heart failure (HTN (+) HFpEF). Biopsies were evaluated for cardiac myocyte cross-sectional area (CSA) and collagen volume fraction. Primary fibroblast cultures were assessed for differences in proliferation and protein expression of collagen I, Membrane Type 1-Matrix Metalloproteinase (MT1-MMP), and α smooth muscle actin (αSMA). Biopsies from HTN (-) HFpEF and HTN (+) HFpEF exhibited increases in myocyte CSA over referent control although only HTN (+) HFpEF exhibited significant increases in fibrillar collagen content. No significant changes in proliferation or αSMA was detected in HTN (-) HFpEF or HTN (+) HFpEF cultures versus referent control. Significant increases in production of collagen I was detected in HF (-) HFpEF fibroblasts, whereas significant decreases in MT1-MMP levels were measured in HTN (+) HFpEF cells. We conclude that epicardial biopsies provide a viable source for primary fibroblast cultures and that phenotypic differences are demonstrated by HTN (-) HFpEF and HTN (+) HFpEF cells versus referent control."
https://openalex.org/W4205952884,"Brain reperfusion following an ischemic event is essential for tissue viability, however, it also involves processes that promote neuronal cell death. We have recently shown that local expression of the hormone leptin in cardiovascular organs drives deleterious remodeling. As cerebral ischemia-reperfusion (IR) lesions derive expression of both the leptin hormone and its receptor, we hypothesized that blocking leptin activity in the injured brain area will reduce the deleterious effects of IR injury.C57BL6 male mice underwent bilateral common carotid artery and external carotid artery ligation. The right hemisphere was reperfused after 12 minutes, followed by intraarterial injection of either a low-dose leptin antagonist or saline solution via the ipsilateral ICA. The left common carotid artery remained ligated. Fifteen IR/leptin antagonist-injected and fourteen IR/saline-injected mice completed the experiment. Five days after surgery brains were collected and samples of the hippocampal CA1 region were analyzed for cell viability (H&E) and apoptosis (TUNEL and caspase3), for neuroinflammation (Iba1), and for signaling pathways of pSTAT3 and pSmad2.The right hemisphere hippocampal CA1 region subjected to IR and saline injection exhibited increased apoptosis and necrosis of pyramidal cells. Also, increased density of activated microglia/macrophages was evident around the CA1 region. Comparatively, leptin antagonist treatment at reperfusion reduced apoptosis and necrosis of pyramidal cells, as indicated by increased number of viable cells (p < 0.01), and reduced TUNEL (p < 0.001) and caspase3-positive cells (p<0.05). Furthermore, this treatment reduced the density of activated microglia/macrophages (p < 0.001) in the CA1 region. Signaling pathway analysis revealed that while pSTAT3 and pSmad2-positive cells were found surrounding the stratum pyramidal in saline-treated animals, pSTAT3 signal was undetected and pSmad2 was greatly reduced in this territory following leptin antagonist treatment (p < 0.01).Inhibition of leptin activity in hemispheric IR injury preserved the viability of ipsilateral hippocampal CA1 neurons, likely by preventing apoptosis and local inflammation. These results indicate that intraarterial anti-leptin therapy may have clinical potential in reducing hemispheric brain IR injury."
https://openalex.org/W4205257336,"Bone quality is a critical factor that, along with bone quantity, determines bone strength. Image-based parameters are used for assessing bone quality non-invasively. The trabecular bone score (TBS) is used to assess quality of trabecular bone and femur geometry for cortical bone. Little is known about the associations between these two bone quality parameters and whether they show differences in the relationships with age and body mass index (BMI). We investigated the associations between the trabecular bone score (TBS) and femur cortical geometry. Areal bone mineral density (BMD) was assessed using dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) and the TBS was assessed using iNsight software and, femur geometry using APEX (Hologic). A total of 452 men and 517 women aged 50 years and older with no medical history of a condition affecting bone metabolism were included. Z-scores for TBS and cortical thickness were calculated using the age-specific mean and SD for each parameter. A 'discrepancy group' was defined as patients whose absolute Z-score difference between TBS and cortical thickness was > 1 point. TBS and cortical thickness correlated negatively with age both in men and women, but the associations were stronger in women. Regarding the associations with BMI, TBS provided significant negative correlation with BMI in the range of BMI > 25 kg/m2. By contrast, cortical thickness correlated positively with BMI for all BMI ranges. These bone quality-related parameters, TBS and cortical thickness, significantly correlated, but discordance between these two parameters was observed in about one-third of the men and women (32.7% and 33.4%, respectively). Conclusively, image-based bone quality parameters for trabecular and cortical bone exhibit both similarities and differences in terms of their associations with age and BMI. These different profiles in TBS and FN cortical thickness might results in different risk profiles for the vertebral fractures or hip fractures in a certain percentage of people."
https://openalex.org/W4205822714,"Purpose We aimed to test the reliability and validity of two brief measures of resilience adopted for the evaluation of a preventative social-emotional curriculum implemented for Aboriginal middle school students from socially disadvantaged remote communities in Australia’s Northern Territory. The questionnaires chosen were intended to measure psychological resilience and socio-cultural resilience as complementary dimensions of the capacity to cope in circumstances of significant life stress and risk of self-harm. Methods Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was conducted to assess construct validity of the 10-item Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC-10), a measure of psychological resilience, and the 12-item Child and Youth Resilience Measure (CYRM-12), a measure of socio-cultural resilience, with a sample of 520 students. Associations between resilience and psychological distress and emotional and behavioural difficulty were analysed in relation to life stressors to assess criterion validity of the scales. Results CFA provided support for the validity of the respective constructs. There was good fit for both scales. However, assessment of criterion validity of the scales suggested that the adapted measure of socio-cultural resilience (CYRM-12NT) showed higher reliability and a clearer indication of predictive validity than the measure of psychological resilience (CD-RISC-10). Conclusions The CYRM-12NT appears to be a more useful measure of resilience among Aboriginal youth exposed to significant life stress and disadvantage. However, both measures may require further development to enhance their validity and utility among potentially at-risk adolescents in socially, culturally and linguistically diverse remote Aboriginal communities."
https://openalex.org/W4225984107,"The mechanism of anaphora resolution is subject to large cross-linguistic differences. The most likely reason for this is the different sensitivity of pronouns to the range of factors that determine their reference. In the current study, we explored the mechanism of anaphora resolution in Polish. First, we explored preferences in the interpretation of null and overt pronouns in ambiguous sentences. More specifically, we investigated whether Polish speakers prefer to relate overt pronouns to subject or object antecedents. Subsequently, we tested the consequences of violating this bias when tracing the online sentence-interpretation process using eye-tracking. Our results show that Polish speakers have a strong preference for interpreting null pronouns as referring to subject antecedents and interpreting overt pronouns as referring to object antecedents. However, in online sentence interpretation, only overt pronouns showed sensitivity to a violation of the speaker's preference for a pronoun-antecedent match. This suggests that null pronoun resolution is more flexible than overt pronoun resolution. Our results indicate that it is much easier for Polish speakers to shift the reference of a null pronoun than an overt one whenever a pronoun is forced to refer to a less-preferred antecedent. These results are supported by naturalness ratings, which showed that null pronouns are considered equally natural regardless of their reference, while overt pronouns referring to subject antecedents are rated as considerably less natural than those referring to object antecedents. To explain this effect, we propose that the interpretation of null and overt pronouns is sensitive to different factors which determine their reference."
