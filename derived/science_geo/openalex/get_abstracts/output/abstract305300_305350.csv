These new isolates are physiologically distinct from slow-growing soybean rhizobia. They formed effective nitrogen-fixing associations with wild soybean and an unbred soybean cultivar from China, but were largely ineffective as nitrogen-fixing symbionts with common commercial cultivars of soybeans."
https://openalex.org/W2046481882,"Black-tailed prairie dogs (Rodentia: Sciuridae: Cynomys ludovicianus) live in colonies composed of contiguous but separate family groups called coteries. During the 6 years that individuals in a colony were observed, they almost nevermated with close genetic relatives. Inbreeding is avoided in four ways: (i) a young male usually leaves his natal coterie before breeding, but his female relatives remain; (ii) an adult male usually leaves his breeding coterie before his daughters mature; (iii) a young female is less likely to come into estrus if her father is in her coterie; and (iv) an estrous female behaviorally avoids mating with a father, son, or brother in her coterie."

https://openalex.org/W2027757324,Gas vacuolation in Oscillatoria rubescens decreased with increased nitrogen limitation and increased with transitions from nitrogen to inorganic carbon limitation. Gas vacuoles consist of protein vesicles that can accumulate in carbon- limited but not in unenriched nitrogen-limited cells. Nitrogen limitation is a factor in the formation of deep population maxima; carbon limitation can promote surface blooms.

Phosphate nodules grow downward into soft sediment, and the rates of phosphorus accumulation into nodules are approximately equal to the upward diffusive flux of dissolved phosphate inferred from pore water profiles. These results demonstrate that phosphorus in nodules originates from regeneration in sediments rather than as a result of direct precipitation from bottom waters."

https://openalex.org/W2056458619,"Three gametophytic plants now known from the Lower Devonian of Scotland and Germany show common features in their fertile parts. The morphological and anatomical structures indicate affinities to bryophytic gametophytes, although there is no evidence for a parasitic sporogonium-like sporophyte as in the Bryophyta. Several of the vascular plant sporophytes from the Rhynie Chert also have a few characteristics reminiscent of bryophytes. But these ancient gametophytes, if related to the sporophytes, indicate a closer relation of Bryophyta to Tracheophyta than would the study of sporophytes alone."

Volumes were low in the morning and reached a maximum by late afternoon. The oxygen was probably produced by the endolithic (boring) algae, with which the Millepora skeletons are very heavily infested. Oxygen production by endolithic algae in Millepora and in other substrates could influence estimates of reef productivity based on measurements of dissolved gases."

https://openalex.org/W1993223573,"Abstract The recent article by ZoBell and Grant notes the attack of rubber by bacteria under conditions of high moisture. It is suggested that “the life of rubber products which come in contact with moisture may be prolonged if ways can be found to retard or prevent the activity of rubber oxidizing microorganisms”. In the compounding of rubber commercially, native rubber is mixed with a number of chemicals, each of which serves a specific purpose in the properties of the finished product. Among these are accelerators which lower the temperature and shorten the time of vulcanization and lengthen the life of rubber. Two well-known accelerators are mercaptobenzothiazole and tetramethylthiuram disulfide. These compounds have been tested for their ability to inhibit germination of fungi, and gross observations have been made on their ability to inhibit bacterial growth. Mercaptobenzothiazole is a moderately good fungicide, and tetramethylthiuram disulfide is excellent. The latter compound is now being marketed..."

It sounds a bit out of balance. is essentially a fight to the death; and we have no substitute for the men who face, and fight with, guns and bombs. The first credit is theirs. I have no quarrel with the phrase Food Will Help Win the War or better still, Food Will Be a Major Factor in Winning the War. We do have a critically important job to do. If we neglect doing it quickly and well, we shall prolong the war and certainly would cause great injury to all humanity. First, let us look at our No. 1 and No. 2 weapons—the airplane and the tank. To be sure, research and production must not be neglected in either of these fields, but no matter ..."

https://openalex.org/W2075973215,"Of glacial geologists the United states has produced a goodly number during the past seven or eight decades, but of glaciologists—students of living glaciers and glacier-ice—this country has at no time possessed more than a scanty few. It is therefore a particularly grievous blow to American science that of the handful of glaciologists of the present time we should have lost through the death of MAX HARRISON DEMOREST one of the most brilliant and, even in his youth, most outstanding.

From the meager advices given out by the War Department it appears that Demorest, who was commissioned a First Lieutenant in the Army Air Corps and was stationed at a remote outpost in Greenland, lost his life on November 30, 1942, in an accident with a motor-sled. We may derive some slight satisfaction from the knowledge that he did not fall before a brutal foe, but met death while on an errand of mercy in a brave attempt to rescue the crew of an army plane that had been forced down on the inhospitable ice-sheet. Of the nature of the accident, no details have been divulged."
