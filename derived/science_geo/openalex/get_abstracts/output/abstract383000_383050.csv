https://openalex.org/W2025041464,"Sulforaphane (SFN), an isothiocyanate found in cruciferous vegetables, is a common dietary component that has histone deacetylase inhibition activity and exciting potential in cancer prevention. The mechanisms by which SFN imparts its chemopreventive properties are of considerable interest and little is known of its preventive potential for breast cancer.We found that SFN significantly inhibits the viability and proliferation of breast cancer cells in vitro while it has negligible effects on normal breast cells. Inhibition of telomerase has received considerable attention because of its high expression in cancer cells and extremely low level of expression in normal cells. SFN treatment dose- and time-dependently inhibited human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT), the catalytic regulatory subunit of telomerase, in both MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cells. DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs), especially DNMT1 and DNMT3a, were also decreased in SFN-treated breast cancer cells suggesting that SFN may repress hTERT by impacting epigenetic pathways. Down-regulation of DNMTs in response to SFN induced site-specific CpG demethylation occurring primarily in the first exon of the hTERT gene thereby facilitating CTCF binding associated with hTERT repression. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analysis of the hTERT promoter revealed that SFN increased the level of active chromatin markers acetyl-H3, acetyl-H3K9 and acetyl-H4, whereas the trimethyl-H3K9 and trimethyl-H3K27 inactive chromatin markers were decreased in a dose-dependent manner. SFN-induced hyperacetylation facilitated the binding of many hTERT repressor proteins such as MAD1 and CTCF to the hTERT regulatory region. Depletion of CTCF using siRNA reduced the SFN-induced down-regulation of hTERT mRNA transcription in these breast cancer cells. In addition, down-regulation of hTERT expression facilitated the induction of cellular apoptosis in human breast cancer cells.Collectively, our results provide novel insights into SFN-mediated epigenetic down-regulation of telomerase in breast cancer prevention and may open new avenues for approaches to SFN-mediated cancer prevention."
https://openalex.org/W2044164623,"Next-generation DNA sequencing coupled with chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP-seq) is revolutionizing our ability to interrogate whole genome protein-DNA interactions. Identification of protein binding sites from ChIP-seq data has required novel computational tools, distinct from those used for the analysis of ChIP-Chip experiments. The growing popularity of ChIP-seq spurred the development of many different analytical programs (at last count, we noted 31 open source methods), each with some purported advantage. Given that the literature is dense and empirical benchmarking challenging, selecting an appropriate method for ChIP-seq analysis has become a daunting task. Herein we compare the performance of eleven different peak calling programs on common empirical, transcription factor datasets and measure their sensitivity, accuracy and usability. Our analysis provides an unbiased critical assessment of available technologies, and should assist researchers in choosing a suitable tool for handling ChIP-seq data."
https://openalex.org/W2136967422,"Background Classical morphological taxonomy places the approximately 1400 recognized species of Scleractinia (hard corals) into 27 families, but many aspects of coral evolution remain unclear despite the application of molecular phylogenetic methods. In part, this may be a consequence of such studies focusing on the reef-building (shallow water and zooxanthellate) Scleractinia, and largely ignoring the large number of deep-sea species. To better understand broad patterns of coral evolution, we generated molecular data for a broad and representative range of deep sea scleractinians collected off New Caledonia and Australia during the last decade, and conducted the most comprehensive molecular phylogenetic analysis to date of the order Scleractinia. Methodology Partial (595 bp) sequences of the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase subunit 1 (CO1) gene were determined for 65 deep-sea (azooxanthellate) scleractinians and 11 shallow-water species. These new data were aligned with 158 published sequences, generating a 234 taxon dataset representing 25 of the 27 currently recognized scleractinian families. Principal Findings/Conclusions There was a striking discrepancy between the taxonomic validity of coral families consisting predominantly of deep-sea or shallow-water species. Most families composed predominantly of deep-sea azooxanthellate species were monophyletic in both maximum likelihood and Bayesian analyses but, by contrast (and consistent with previous studies), most families composed predominantly of shallow-water zooxanthellate taxa were polyphyletic, although Acroporidae, Poritidae, Pocilloporidae, and Fungiidae were exceptions to this general pattern. One factor contributing to this inconsistency may be the greater environmental stability of deep-sea environments, effectively removing taxonomic “noise” contributed by phenotypic plasticity. Our phylogenetic analyses imply that the most basal extant scleractinians are azooxanthellate solitary corals from deep-water, their divergence predating that of the robust and complex corals. Deep-sea corals are likely to be critical to understanding anthozoan evolution and the origins of the Scleractinia."
https://openalex.org/W2053346291,"Recent advances in our understanding of translational dynamics indicate that codon usage and mRNA secondary structure influence translation and protein folding. The most frequent cause of cystic fibrosis (CF) is the deletion of three nucleotides (CTT) from the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene that includes the last cytosine (C) of isoleucine 507 (Ile507ATC) and the two thymidines (T) of phenylalanine 508 (Phe508TTT) codons. The consequences of the deletion are the loss of phenylalanine at the 508 position of the CFTR protein (DeltaF508), a synonymous codon change for isoleucine 507 (Ile507ATT), and protein misfolding. Here we demonstrate that the DeltaF508 mutation alters the secondary structure of the CFTR mRNA. Molecular modeling predicts and RNase assays support the presence of two enlarged single stranded loops in the DeltaF508 CFTR mRNA in the vicinity of the mutation. The consequence of DeltaF508 CFTR mRNA ""misfolding"" is decreased translational rate. A synonymous single nucleotide variant of the DeltaF508 CFTR (Ile507ATC), that could exist naturally if Phe-508 was encoded by TTC, has wild type-like mRNA structure, and enhanced expression levels when compared with native DeltaF508 CFTR. Because CFTR folding is predominantly cotranslational, changes in translational dynamics may promote DeltaF508 CFTR misfolding. Therefore, we propose that mRNA ""misfolding"" contributes to DeltaF508 CFTR protein misfolding and consequently to the severity of the human DeltaF508 phenotype. Our studies suggest that in addition to modifier genes, SNPs may also contribute to the differences observed in the symptoms of various DeltaF508 homozygous CF patients."

We previously demonstrated that BMP9 is one of the most potent BMPs to induce osteogenic differentiation of MSCs. BMP9 is one of the least studied BMPs. Whereas ALK1, ALK5, and/or endoglin have recently been reported as potential BMP9 type I receptors in endothelial cells, little is known about type I receptor involvement in BMP9-induced osteogenic differentiation in MSCs. Here, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of the functional role of seven type I receptors in BMP9-induced osteogenic signaling in MSCs. We have found that most of the seven type I receptors are expressed in MSCs. However, using dominant-negative mutants for the seven type I receptors, we demonstrate that only ALK1 and ALK2 mutants effectively inhibit BMP9-induced osteogenic differentiation in vitro and ectopic ossification in MSC implantation assays. Protein fragment complementation assays demonstrate that ALK1 and ALK2 directly interact with BMP9. Likewise, RNAi silencing of ALK1 and ALK2 expression inhibits BMP9-induced BMPR-Smad activity and osteogenic differentiation in MSCs both in vitro and in vivo.

BMP9 (a.k.a., GDF2) was originally identified from fetal mouse liver cDNA libraries, and is a relatively uncharacterized member of the BMP family (17Song J.J. Celeste A.J. Kong F.M. Jirtle R.L.

BMP9 is highly expressed in the developing mouse liver, and recombinant human BMP9 stimulates hepatocyte proliferation (17Song J.J. Celeste A.J. Kong F.M. Jirtle R.L. Rosen V. Thies R.S.

BMP9 has been shown to be a potent synergistic factor for hematopoietic progenitor generation and colony formation (21Ploemacher R.E. Engels L.J. Mayer A.E. Thies S. Neben S.

Nonetheless, the signaling mechanism through which BMP9 regulates osteogenic differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells remains to be fully elucidated. Members of the TGFβ/BMP superfamily initiate their signaling events through an interaction of their type I and type II receptors, both of which are transmembrane serine/threonine kinases (24Massagué J. Weis-Garcia F. Cancer Surv. 1996; 27: 41-64PubMed Google Scholar, 25Miyazono K. Maeda S. Imamura T.

Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 2009; 20: 343-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). Seven type I receptors (a.k.a. activin receptor-like receptors; ALK1 to ALK7) and four type II receptors have been identified in mice and humans (25Miyazono K. Maeda S. Imamura T. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 2005; 16: 251-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (712) Google Scholar, 26Sieber C. Kopf J. Hiepen C. Knaus P. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 2009; 20: 343-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). In the TGFβ paradigm, the type II receptor binds with high affinity and is responsible for cooperative recruitment and transphosphorylation of its low-affinity type I pair (24Massagué J. Weis-Garcia F. Cancer Surv. 1996; 27: 41-64PubMed Google Scholar). However, many BMP receptors have mixed affinities for their ligands. For example, ActRII has moderate affinity for BMP-7 and interacts weakly with BMP-2, whereas BMPRIA (e.g. ALK3) binds with high affinity to BMP-2 but binds weakly to BMP-7 (25Miyazono K. Maeda S. Imamura T. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 2005; 16: 251-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (712) Google Scholar, 26Sieber C. Kopf J. Hiepen C. Knaus P.

As one of the least characterized BMPs, BMP9 has been recently shown that ALK1, ALK5 and/or endoglin may act as BMP9 type I receptors in endothelial cells (27Brown M.A. Zhao Q. Baker K.A. Naik C.

However, it remains unclear which type I receptor(s) play an essential role in BMP9-induced osteogenic differentiation of MSCs. Furthermore, it is conceivable that distinct type I receptor(s) may play a major role at different stages of MSC differentiation. We have conducted a comprehensive analysis of the seven type I receptors for their role in BMP9 osteogenic signaling and demonstrated that ALK1 and ALK2 play an important role in mediating BMP9-induced osteogenic differentiation. Using dominant-negative mutants of seven type I receptors, we have demonstrated that ALK1 and ALK2 mutants effectively inhibit BMP9-induced early osteogenic differentiation in vitro and ectopic ossification in vivo. RNAi silencing of ALK1 and ALK2 inhibits the BMPR-Smad mediated transcription activity, the early osteogenic marker ALP activity, and the ectopic ossification of MSCs stimulated with BMP9. Taken together, these results reveal an important functional role of ALK1 and ALK2 in BMP9-induced osteogenic differentiation of MSCs.

https://openalex.org/W2103366253,"An ancient cyanobacterial incorporation into a eukaryotic organism led to the evolution of plastids (chloroplasts) and subsequently to the origin of the plant kingdom. The underlying mechanism and the identities of the partners in this monophyletic event remain elusive.To shed light on this evolutionary process, we sequenced the genome of a cyanobacterium residing extracellularly in an endosymbiosis with a plant, the water-fern Azolla filiculoides Lam. This symbiosis was selected as it has characters which make it unique among extant cyanobacterial plant symbioses: the cyanobacterium lacks autonomous growth and is vertically transmitted between plant generations. Our results reveal features of evolutionary significance. The genome is in an eroding state, evidenced by a large proportion of pseudogenes (31.2%) and a high frequency of transposable elements (approximately 600) scattered throughout the genome. Pseudogenization is found in genes such as the replication initiator dnaA and DNA repair genes, considered essential to free-living cyanobacteria. For some functional categories of genes pseudogenes are more prevalent than functional genes. Loss of function is apparent even within the 'core' gene categories of bacteria, such as genes involved in glycolysis and nutrient uptake. In contrast, serving as a critical source of nitrogen for the host, genes related to metabolic processes such as cell differentiation and nitrogen-fixation are well preserved.This is the first finding of genome degradation in a plant symbiont and phenotypically complex cyanobacterium and one of only a few extracellular endosymbionts described showing signs of reductive genome evolution. Our findings suggest an ongoing selective streamlining of this cyanobacterial genome which has resulted in an organism devoted to nitrogen fixation and devoid of autonomous growth. The cyanobacterial symbiont of Azolla can thus be considered at the initial phase of a transition from free-living organism to a nitrogen-fixing plant entity, a transition process which may mimic what drove the evolution of chloroplasts from a cyanobacterial ancestor."
https://openalex.org/W2035039373,"The replicative cycle of chikungunya virus (CHIKV), an alphavirus that recently re-emerged in India and in Indian Ocean area, remains mostly unknown. The aim of the present study was to investigate the intracellular trafficking pathway(s) hijacked by CHIKV to enter mammalian cells.Entry pathways were investigated using a variety of pharmacological inhibitors or overexpression of dominant negative forms of proteins perturbating cellular endocytosis. We found that CHIKV infection of HEK293T mammalian cells is independent of clathrin heavy chain and- dependent of functional Eps15, and requires integrity of Rab5-, but not Rab7-positive endosomal compartment. Cytoskeleton integrity is crucial as cytochalasin D and nocodazole significantly reduced infection of the cells. Finally, both methyl beta-cyclodextrin and lysomotropic agents impaired CHIKV infection, supporting that a cholesterol-, pH-dependent step is required to achieve productive infection. Interestingly, differential sensitivity to lysomotropic agents was observed between the prototypal 37997 African strain of CHIKV and the LR-OPY1 virus isolated from the recent outbreak in Reunion Island.Together our data indicate that CHIKV entry in its target cells is essentially mediated by clathrin-independent, Eps15-dependent endocytosis. Despite that this property is shared by the prototypal 37997 African strain of CHIKV and the LR-OPY1 virus isolated from the recent outbreak in La Réunion Island, differential sensitivity to lysomotropic agents may support that the LR-OPY1 strain has acquired specific entry mechanisms."

Changes in aquaporin 1 and 4 expression in the brain are associated with cerebral edema, and the lack of water channel modulators is often highlighted. Here we present evidence of an endogenous modulator of aquaporin 1 and 4. We identify miR-320a as a potential modulator of aquaporin 1 and 4 and explore the possibility of using miR-320a to alter the expression of aquaporin 1 and 4 in normal and ischemic conditions. We show that precursor miR-320a can function as an inhibitor, whereas anti-miR-320a can act as an activator of aquaporin 1 and 4 expressions. We have also shown that anti-miR-320a could bring about a reduction of infarct volume in cerebral ischemia with a concomitant increase in aquaporins 1 and 4 mRNA and protein expression."

Originally, SP cells were isolated from bone marrow but recently have been found in various solid tumors and cancer cell lines that are clonogenic in vitro and tumorigenic in vivo. In this study, SP cells from lymph node metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) cell lines were examined using flow cytometry and Hoechst 3342 efflux assay. We found that highly metastatic HNSCC cell lines M3a2 and M4e contained more SP cells compared to the low metastatic parental HNSCC cell line 686LN. SP cells in HNSCC were highly invasive in vitro and tumorigenic in vivo compared to non-SP cells. Furthermore, SP cells highly expressed ABCG2 and were chemoresistant to Bortezomib and etoposide. Importantly, we found that SP cells in HNSCC had abnormal activation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling as compared to non-SP cells. Together, these findings indicate that SP cells might be a major driving force of head and neck tumor formation and metastasis. The Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway may be an important target for eliminating cancer stem cells in HNSCC."

Optimized UDPS protocols and bioinformatic software were developed to generate, clean and analyze the data. The data cleaning strategy reduced the error rate of UDPS to an average of 0.05%, which is lower than previously reported. Consequently, the cut-off for detection of resistance mutations was very low. A median of 16,016 (range 2,406-35,401) sequence reads were obtained per sample, which allowed detection and quantification of minority resistance mutations at amino acid position 181, 184, 188, 190, 210, 215 and 219 in RT. In four of five pre-treatment samples low levels (0.07-0.09%) of the M184I mutation were observed. Other resistance mutations, except T215A and T215I were below the detection limit. During treatment failure, M184V replaced M184I and dominated the population in combination with T215Y, while wild-type variants were rarely detected. Resistant virus disappeared rapidly after treatment interruption and was undetectable as early as after 3 months. In most patients, drug resistant variants were replaced by wild-type variants identical to those present before treatment, suggesting rebound from latent reservoirs.With this highly sensitive UDPS protocol preexisting drug resistance was infrequently observed; only M184I, T215A and T215I were detected at very low levels. Similarly, drug resistant variants in plasma quickly decreased to undetectable levels after treatment interruption. The study gives important insights into the dynamics of the HIV-1 quasispecies and is of relevance for future research and clinical use of the UDPS technology."
https://openalex.org/W2068435854,"Infections may be associated with exacerbation of allergic and autoimmune diseases. Paradoxically, epidemiological and experimental data have shown that some microorganisms can also prevent these pathologies. This observation is at the origin of the hygiene hypothesis according to which the decline of infections in western countries is at the origin of the increased incidence of both Th1-mediated autoimmune diseases and Th2-mediated allergic diseases over the last decades. We have tested whether Toll-like receptor (TLR) stimulation can recapitulate the protective effect of infectious agents on allergy and autoimmunity.Here, we performed a systematic study of the disease-modifying effects of a set of natural or synthetic TLR agonists using two experimental models, ovalbumin (OVA)-induced asthma and spontaneous autoimmune diabetes, presenting the same genetic background of the non obese diabetic mouse (NOD) that is highly susceptible to both pathologies. In the same models, we also investigated the effect of probiotics. Additionally, we examined the effect of the genetic invalidation of MyD88 on the development of allergic asthma and spontaneous diabetes. We demonstrate that multiple TLR agonists prevent from both allergy and autoimmunity when administered parenterally. Probiotics which stimulate TLRs also protect from these two diseases. The physiological relevance of these findings is further suggested by the major acceleration of OVA-induced asthma in MyD88 invalidated mice. Our results strongly indicate that the TLR-mediated effects involve immunoregulatory cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-10 and transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta and different subsets of regulatory T cells, notably CD4+CD25+FoxP3+ T cells for TLR4 agonists and NKT cells for TLR3 agonists.These observations demonstrate that systemic administration of TLR ligands can suppress both allergic and autoimmune responses. They provide a plausible explanation for the hygiene hypothesis. They also open new therapeutic perspectives for the prevention of these pathologies."

The neurological and endocrine phenotypes of patients deficient in MCT8 function underscore the physiological significance of carrier-mediated TH transmembrane transport. MCT8 belongs to the major facilitator superfamily of 12 transmembrane-spanning proteins and mediates energy-independent bidirectional transport of iodothyronines across the plasma membrane. Structural information is lacking for all TH transmembrane transporters. To gain insight into structure-function relations in TH transport, we chose human MCT8 as a paradigm. We systematically performed conventional and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry-based uptake measurements into MCT8-transfected cells using a large number of compounds structurally related to iodothyronines. We found that human MCT8 is specific for l-iodothyronines and requires at least one iodine atom per aromatic ring. Neither thyronamines, decarboxylated metabolites of iodothyronines, nor triiodothyroacetic acid and tetraiodothyroacetic acid, TH derivatives lacking both chiral center and amino group, are substrates for MCT8. The polyphenolic flavonoids naringenin and F21388, potent competitors for TH binding at transthyretin, did not inhibit T3 transport, suggesting that MCT8 can discriminate its ligand better than transthyretin. Bioinformatic studies and a first molecular homology model of MCT8 suggested amino acids potentially involved in substrate interaction. Indeed, alanine mutation of either Arg445 (helix 8) or Asp498 (helix 10) abrogated T3 transport activity of MCT8, supporting their predicted role in substrate recognition.

https://openalex.org/W2082526148,"Histone deacetylase (Hdac)3 is a nuclear enzyme that contributes to epigenetic programming and is required for embryonic development. To determine the role of Hdac3 in bone formation, we crossed mice harboring loxP sites around exon 7 of Hdac3 with mice expressing Cre recombinase under the control of the osterix promoter. The resulting Hdac3 conditional knockout (CKO) mice were runted and had severe deficits in intramembranous and endochondral bone formation. Calvarial bones were significantly thinner and trabecular bone volume in the distal femur was decreased 75% in the Hdac3 CKO mice due to a substantial reduction in trabecular number. Hdac3-CKO mice had fewer osteoblasts and more bone marrow adipocytes as a proportion of tissue area than their wildtype or heterozygous littermates. Bone formation rates were depressed in both the cortical and trabecular regions of Hdac3 CKO femurs. Microarray analyses revealed that numerous developmental signaling pathways were affected by Hdac3-deficiency. Thus, Hdac3 depletion in osterix-expressing progenitor cells interferes with bone formation and promotes bone marrow adipocyte differentiation. These results demonstrate that Hdac3 inhibition is detrimental to skeletal health."

PB+ adipocytes were noted, demonstrating their donor origin, as well as PB+ pericytes, indicative of self-renewal of the stem cell in the BMSC population. This study confirms that SPION labeling does not alter the differentiation potential of the subset of stem cells within BMSCs."
https://openalex.org/W1973784868,"Background Notch receptor signaling controls developmental cell fates in a cell-context dependent manner. Although Notch signaling directly regulates transcription via the RBP-J/CSL DNA binding protein, little is known about the target genes that are directly activated by Notch in the respective tissues. Methodology/Principal Findings To analyze how Notch signaling mediates its context dependent function(s), we utilized a Tamoxifen-inducible system to activate Notch1 in murine embryonic stem cells at different stages of mesodermal differentiation and performed global transcriptional analyses. We find that the majority of genes regulated by Notch1 are unique for the cell type and vary widely dependent on other signals. We further show that Notch1 signaling regulates expression of genes playing key roles in cell differentiation, cell cycle control and apoptosis in a context dependent manner. In addition to the known Notch1 targets of the Hes and Hey families of transcriptional repressors, Notch1 activates the expression of regulatory transcription factors such as Sox9, Pax6, Runx1, Myf5 and Id proteins that are critically involved in lineage decisions in the absence of protein synthesis. Conclusion/Significance We suggest that Notch signaling determines lineage decisions and expansion of stem cells by directly activating both key lineage specific transcription factors and their repressors (Id and Hes/Hey proteins) and propose a model by which Notch signaling regulates cell fate commitment and self renewal in dependence of the intrinsic and extrinsic cellular context."
https://openalex.org/W2047128497,"Although transcriptional effects of androgens have been extensively studied, mechanisms regulating transcription-independent (nongenomic) androgen actions are poorly understood. Previously, we have shown that paxillin, a multidomain adaptor protein, is a critical regulator of testosterone-induced MAPK-signaling during Xenopus oocyte maturation. Here we examine the nongenomic effects of dihydrotestosterone (DHT) in prostate cancer cells, focusing on how paxillin mediates Erk signaling and downstream physiologic actions. We show that in LnCAP cells DHT functions as a growth factor that indirectly activates the EGF-receptor (EGFR) via androgen receptor binding and matrix metalloproteinase-mediated release of EGFR ligands. Interestingly, siRNA-mediated knockdown of paxillin expression in androgen-dependent LnCAP cells as well as in androgen-independent PC3 cells abrogates DHT- and/or EGF-induced Erk signaling. Furthermore, EGFR-induced Erk activation requires Src-mediated phosphorylation of paxillin on tyrosines 31/118. In contrast, paxillin is not required for PKC-induced Erk signaling. However, Erk-mediated phosphorylation of paxillin on serines 83/126/130 is still needed for both EGFR and PKC-mediated cellular proliferation. Thus, paxillin serves as a specific upstream regulator of Erk in response to receptor-tyrosine kinase signaling but as a general regulator of downstream Erk actions regardless of agonist. Importantly, Erk-mediated serine phosphorylation of paxillin is also required for DHT-induced prostate-specific antigen mRNA expression in LnCAP cells as well as EGF-induced cyclin D1 mRNA expression in PC3 cells, suggesting that paxillin may regulate prostate cancer proliferation by serving as a liaison between extra-nuclear kinase signaling and intra-nuclear transcriptional signals. Thus, paxillin may prove to be a novel diagnostic or therapeutic target in prostate cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2157474891,"Background Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON) is a maternally inherited disorder with point mutations in mitochondrial DNA which result in loss of vision in young adults. The majority of mutations reported to date are within the genes encoding the subunits of the mitochondrial NADH-quinone oxidoreductase, complex I. Establishment of animal models of LHON should help elucidate mechanism of the disease and could be utilized for possible development of therapeutic strategies. Methodology/Principal Findings We established a rat model which involves injection of rotenone-loaded microspheres into the optic layer of the rat superior colliculus. The animals exhibited the most common features of LHON. Visual loss was observed within 2 weeks of rotenone administration with no apparent effect on retinal ganglion cells. Death of retinal ganglion cells occurred at a later stage. Using our rat model, we investigated the effect of the yeast alternative NADH dehydrogenase, Ndi1. We were able to achieve efficient expression of the Ndi1 protein in the mitochondria of all regions of retinal ganglion cells and axons by delivering the NDI1 gene into the optical layer of the superior colliculus. Remarkably, even after the vision of the rats was severely impaired, treatment of the animals with the NDI1 gene led to a complete restoration of the vision to the normal level. Control groups that received either empty vector or the GFP gene had no effects. Conclusions/Significance The present study reports successful manifestation of LHON-like symptoms in rats and demonstrates the potential of the NDI1 gene therapy on mitochondrial optic neuropathies. Our results indicate a window of opportunity for the gene therapy to be applied successfully after the onset of the disease symptoms."
https://openalex.org/W2018368316,"In Drosophila, neurosecretory cells that release peptide hormones play a prominent role in the regulation of development, growth, metabolism, and reproduction. Several types of peptidergic neurosecretory cells have been identified in the brain of Drosophila with release sites in the corpora cardiaca and anterior aorta. We show here that in adult flies the products of three neuropeptide precursors are colocalized in five pairs of large protocerebral neurosecretory cells in two clusters (designated ipc-1 and ipc-2a): Drosophila tachykinin (DTK), short neuropeptide F (sNPF) and ion transport peptide (ITP). These peptides were detected by immunocytochemistry in combination with GFP expression driven by the enhancer trap Gal4 lines c929 and Kurs-6, both of which are expressed in ipc-1 and 2a cells. This mix of colocalized peptides with seemingly unrelated functions is intriguing and prompted us to initiate analysis of the function of the ten neurosecretory cells. We investigated the role of peptide signaling from large ipc-1 and 2a cells in stress responses by monitoring the effect of starvation and desiccation in flies with levels of DTK or sNPF diminished by RNA interference. Using the Gal4-UAS system we targeted the peptide knockdown specifically to ipc-1 and 2a cells with the c929 and Kurs-6 drivers. Flies with reduced DTK or sNPF levels in these cells displayed decreased survival time at desiccation and starvation, as well as increased water loss at desiccation. Our data suggest that homeostasis during metabolic stress requires intact peptide signaling by ipc-1 and 2a neurosecretory cells."
https://openalex.org/W2063353933,"Background Previous studies identified melatonin receptor 1B (MTNR1B), islet-specific glucose 6 phosphatase catalytic subunit-related protein (G6PC2), glucokinase (GCK) and glucokinase regulatory protein (GCKR) as candidate genes for type 2 diabetes (T2D) acting through elevated fasting plasma glucose (FPG). We examined the associations of the reported common variants of these genes with T2D and glucose homeostasis in three independent Chinese cohorts. Methodology/Principal Findings Five single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), MTNR1B rs10830963, G6PC2 rs16856187 and rs478333, GCK rs1799884 and GCKR rs780094, were genotyped in 1644 controls (583 adults and 1061 adolescents) and 1342 T2D patients. The G-allele of MTNR1B rs10830963 and the C-alleles of both G6PC2 rs16856187 and rs478333 were associated with higher FPG (0.0034<P<6.6×10−5) in healthy controls. In addition to our previous report for association with FPG, the A-allele of GCK rs1799884 was also associated with reduced homeostasis model assessment of beta-cell function (HOMA-B) (P = 0.0015). Together with GCKR rs780094, the risk alleles of these SNPs exhibited dosage effect in their associations with increased FPG (P = 2.9×10−9) and reduced HOMA-B (P = 1.1×10−3). Meta-analyses strongly supported additive effects of MTNR1B rs10830963 and G6PC2 rs16856187 on FPG. Conclusions/Significance Common variants of MTNR1B, G6PC2 and GCK are associated with elevated FPG and impaired insulin secretion, both individually and jointly, suggesting that these risk alleles may precipitate or perpetuate hyperglycemia in predisposed individuals."
https://openalex.org/W2064436081,"Painful peripheral neuropathy has become the principal neurological disorder in HIV/AIDS patients. Herein, we investigated the effects of a cytotoxic HIV-1 accessory protein, viral protein R (Vpr), on the peripheral nervous system (PNS). Host and viral gene expression was investigated in peripheral nerves from HIV-infected individuals and in HIV-infected human dorsal root ganglion (DRG) cultures by RT-PCR and immunocytochemistry. Cytosolic calcium ([Ca2+]) fluxes and neuronal membrane responses were analyzed in cultured DRGs. Neurobehavioral responses and cytokine levels were assessed in a transgenic mouse model in which the vpr transgene was expressed in an immunodeficient background (vpr/RAG1−/−). Vpr transcripts and proteins were detected in peripheral nerves and DRGs from HIV-infected patients. Exposure of rat or human cultured DRG neurons to Vpr rapidly increased [Ca2+] and action potential frequency while increasing input resistance. HIV infection of human DRG cultures caused neurite retraction (P<0.05), accompanied by induction of interferon-α (IFN-α) transcripts (P<0.05). vpr/RAG1−/− mice expressed Vpr together with increased IFN-α (P<0.05) in the PNS and also exhibited mechanical allodynia, unlike their vpr/RAG1−/− littermates (P<0.05). Herein, Vpr caused DRG neuronal damage, likely through cytosolic calcium activation and cytokine perturbation, highlighting Vpr's contribution to HIV-associated peripheral neuropathy and ensuing neuropathic pain.—Acharjee, S., Noorbakhsh, S., Stemkowski, P.

https://openalex.org/W1999245658,"The mammalian type I gonadotropin releasing hormone receptor (GnRH-R) is a structurally unique G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) that lacks cytoplasmic tail sequences and displays inefficient plasma membrane expression (PME). Compared to its murine counterparts, the primate type I receptor is inefficiently folded and retained in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) leading to a further reduction in PME. The decrease in PME and concomitant increase in intracellular localization of the mammalian GnRH-RI led us to characterize the spatial distribution of the human and mouse GnRH receptors in two human cell lines, HEK 293 and HTR-8/SVneo. In both human cell lines we found the receptors were expressed in the cytoplasm and were associated with the ER and nuclear membrane. A molecular analysis of the receptor protein sequence led us to identify a putative monopartite nuclear localization sequence (NLS) in the first intracellular loop of GnRH-RI. Surprisingly, however, neither the deletion of the NLS nor the addition of the Xenopus GnRH-R cytoplasmic tail sequences to the human receptor altered its spatial distribution. Finally, we demonstrate that GnRH treatment of nuclei isolated from HEK 293 cells expressing exogenous GnRH-RI triggers a significant increase in the acetylation and phosphorylation of histone H3, thereby revealing that the nuclear-localized receptor is functional. Based on our findings, we conclude that the mammalian GnRH-RI is an intracellular GPCR that is expressed on the nuclear membrane. This major and novel discovery causes us to reassess the signaling potential of this physiologically and clinically important receptor."
https://openalex.org/W2089312971,"Puberty is a critical period in mesocorticolimbic dopamine (DA) system development, particularly for the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) projection which achieves maturity in early adulthood. The guidance cue netrin-1 organizes neuronal networks by attracting or repelling cellular processes through DCC (deleted in colorectal cancer) and UNC-5 homologue (UNC5H) receptors, respectively. We have shown that variations in netrin-1 receptor levels lead to selective reorganization of mPFC DA circuitry, and changes in DA-related behaviors, in transgenic mice and in rats. Significantly, these effects are only observed after puberty, suggesting that netrin-1 mediated effects on DA systems vary across development. Here we report on the normal expression of DCC and UNC5H in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) by DA neurons from embryonic life to adulthood, in both mice and rats. We show a dramatic and enduring pubertal change in the ratio of DCC:UNC5H receptors, reflecting a shift toward predominant UNC5H function. This shift in DCC:UNC5H ratio coincides with the pubertal emergence of UNC5H expression by VTA DA neurons. Although the distribution of DCC and UNC5H by VTA DA neurons changes during puberty, the pattern of netrin-1 immunoreactivity in these cells does not. Together, our findings suggest that DCC:UNC5H ratios in DA neurons at critical periods may have important consequences for the organization and function of mesocorticolimbic DA systems."
https://openalex.org/W2013331682,"Increased generation of dihydrosphingosine (DHS), a bioactive sphingolipid, has been implicated in the cytotoxicity of the synthetic retinoid N-(4-hydroxyphenyl)retinamide (4-HPR) in tumor cells. However, how 4-HPR increases DHS remains unclear. Here we demonstrate that 4-HPR increases the expression of ACER2, which catalyzes the hydrolysis of dihydroceramides to generate DHS, and that ACER2 up-regulation plays a key role in mediating the 4-HPR-induced generation of DHS as well as the cytotoxicity of 4-HPR in tumor cells. Treatment with 4-HPR induced the accumulation of dihydroceramides (DHCs) in tumor cells by inhibiting dihydroceramide desaturase (DES) activity, which catalyzes the conversion of DHCs to ceramides. Treatment with 4-HPR also increased ACER2 expression through a retinoic acid receptor-independent and caspase-dependent manner. Overexpression of ACER2 augmented the 4-HPR-induced generation of DHS as well as 4-HPR cytotoxicity, and 4-HPR-induced death in tumor cells, whereas knocking down ACER2 had the opposite effects. ACER2 overexpression, along with treatment with GT11, another DES inhibitor, markedly increased cellular DHS, leading to tumor cell death, whereas ACER2 overexpression or GT11 treatment alone failed to do so, suggesting that both ACER2 up-regulation and DES inhibition are necessary and sufficient to mediate 4-HPR-induced DHS accumulation, cytotoxicity, and death in tumor cells. Taken together, these results suggest that up-regulation of the ACER2/DHS pathway mediates the cytotoxicity of 4-HPR in tumor cells and that up-regulating or activating ACER2 may improve the anti-cancer activity of 4-HRR and other DHC-inducing agents."
https://openalex.org/W1994157833,"Background Sleep spindles are ∼1-second bursts of 10–15 Hz activity, occurring during normal stage 2 sleep. In animals, sleep spindles can be synchronous across multiple cortical and thalamic locations, suggesting a distributed stable phase-locked generating system. The high synchrony of spindles across scalp EEG sites suggests that this may also be true in humans. However, prior MEG studies suggest multiple and varying generators. Methodology/Principal Findings We recorded 306 channels of MEG simultaneously with 60 channels of EEG during naturally occurring spindles of stage 2 sleep in 7 healthy subjects. High-resolution structural MRI was obtained in each subject, to define the shells for a boundary element forward solution and to reconstruct the cortex providing the solution space for a noise-normalized minimum norm source estimation procedure. Integrated across the entire duration of all spindles, sources estimated from EEG and MEG are similar, diffuse and widespread, including all lobes from both hemispheres. However, the locations, phase and amplitude of sources simultaneously estimated from MEG versus EEG are highly distinct during the same spindles. Specifically, the sources estimated from EEG are highly synchronous across the cortex, whereas those from MEG rapidly shift in phase, hemisphere, and the location within the hemisphere. Conclusions/Significance The heterogeneity of MEG sources implies that multiple generators are active during human sleep spindles. If the source modeling is correct, then EEG spindles are generated by a different, diffusely synchronous system. Animal studies have identified two thalamo-cortical systems, core and matrix, that produce focal or diffuse activation and thus could underlie MEG and EEG spindles, respectively. Alternatively, EEG spindles could reflect overlap at the sensors of the same sources as are seen from the MEG. Although our results generally match human intracranial recordings, additional improvements are possible and simultaneous intra- and extra-cranial measures are needed to test their accuracy."
https://openalex.org/W2151948433,"Differential herbivory and/or differential plant resistance or tolerance in sun and shade environments may influence plant distribution along the light gradient. Embothrium coccineum is one of the few light-demanding tree species in the temperate rainforest of southern South America, and seedlings are frequently attacked by insects and snails. Herbivory may contribute to the exclusion of E. coccineum from the shade if 1) herbivory pressure is greater in the shade, which in turn can result from shade plants being less resistant or from habitat preferences of herbivores, and/or 2) consequences of damage are more detrimental in the shade, i.e., shade plants are less tolerant. We tested this in a field study with naturally established seedlings in treefall gaps (sun) and forest understory (shade) in a temperate rainforest of southern Chile. Seedlings growing in the sun sustained nearly 40% more herbivore damage and displayed half of the specific leaf area than those growing in the shade. A palatability test showed that a generalist snail consumed ten times more leaf area when fed on shade leaves compared to sun leaves, i.e., plant resistance was greater in sun-grown seedlings. Herbivore abundance (total biomass) was two-fold greater in treefall gaps compared to the forest understory. Undamaged seedlings survived better and showed a slightly higher growth rate in the sun. Whereas simulated herbivory in the shade decreased seedling survival and growth by 34% and 19%, respectively, damaged and undamaged seedlings showed similar survival and growth in the sun. Leaf tissue lost to herbivores in the shade appears to be too expensive to replace under the limiting light conditions of forest understory. Following evaluations of herbivore abundance and plant resistance and tolerance in contrasting light environments, we have shown how herbivory on a light-demanding tree species may contribute to its exclusion from shade sites. Thus, in the shaded forest understory, where the seedlings of some tree species are close to their physiological tolerance limit, herbivory could play an important role in plant establishment."
https://openalex.org/W1988898343,"The conversion of androgen receptor (AR) signaling as a mechanism of growth suppression of normal prostate epithelial cells to that of growth stimulation in prostate cancer cells is often associated with AR mutation, amplification and over-expression. Thus, down-regulation of AR signaling is commonly therapeutic for prostate cancer. The E006AA cell line was established from a hormone naïve, localized prostate cancer. E006AA cells are genetically aneuploid and grow equally well when xenografted into either intact or castrated male NOG but not nude mice. These cells exhibit: 1) X chromosome duplication and AR gene amplification, although paradoxically not coupled with increased AR expression, and 2) somatic, dominant-negative Serine-599-Glycine loss-of-function mutation within the dimerization surface of the DNA binding domain of the AR gene. No effect on the growth of E006AA cells is observed using targeted knockdown of endogenous mutant AR, ectopic expression of wild-type AR, or treatment with androgens or anti-androgens. E006AA cells represent a prototype for a newly identified subtype of prostate cancer cells that exhibit a dominant-negative AR loss-of-function in a hormonally naïve patient. Such loss-of-function eliminates AR-mediated growth suppression normally induced by normal physiological levels of androgens, thus producing a selective growth advantage for these malignant cells in hormonally naïve patients. These data highlight that loss of AR-mediated growth suppression is an independent process, and that, without additional changes, is insufficient for acquiring oncogene addiction to AR signaling. Thus, patients with prostate cancer cells harboring such AR loss-of-function mutations will not benefit from aggressive hormone or anti-AR therapies even though they express AR protein."

Their number in peripheral blood is related to cardiovascular events in individuals with normal renal function.We evaluated the association between functionally active EPCs (cell culture) and traditional cardiovascular risk factors in 265 patients with chronic kidney disease stage V receiving hemodialysis therapy. Thereafter, we prospectively assessed cardiovascular events, e.g. myocardial infarction, percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (including stenting), aorto-coronary bypass, stroke and angiographically verified stenosis of peripheral arteries, and cardiovascular death in this cohort.In our patients EPCs were related only to age (r=0.154; p=0.01). During a median follow-up period of 36 months 109 (41%) patients experienced a cardiovascular event. In a multiple Cox regression analysis, we identified EPCs (p=0.03) and patient age (p=0.01) as the only independent variables associated with incident cardiovascular events. Moreover, a total of 70 patients died during follow-up, 45 of those due to cardiovascular causes. Log rank test confirmed statistical significance for EPCs concerning incident cardiovascular events (p=0.02).We found a significant association between the number of functionally active EPCs and cardiovascular events in patients with chronic kidney disease. Thus, defective vascular repair and regeneration may be responsible, at least in part, for the enormous cardiovascular morbidity in this population."
https://openalex.org/W2004673460,"Background Despite impressive advances in our understanding of the biology of novel influenza A(H1N1) virus, little is as yet known about its transmission efficiency in close contact places such as households, schools, and workplaces. These are widely believed to be key in supporting propagating spread, and it is therefore of importance to assess the transmission levels of the virus in such settings. Methodology/Principal Findings We estimate the transmissibility of novel influenza A(H1N1) in 47 households in the Netherlands using stochastic epidemic models. All households contained a laboratory confirmed index case, and antiviral drugs (oseltamivir) were given to both the index case and other households members within 24 hours after detection of the index case. Among the 109 household contacts there were 9 secondary infections in 7 households. The overall estimated secondary attack rate is low (0.075, 95%CI: 0.037–0.13). There is statistical evidence indicating that older persons are less susceptible to infection than younger persons (relative susceptibility of older persons: 0.11, 95%CI: 0.024–0.43. Notably, the secondary attack rate from an older to a younger person is 0.35 (95%CI: 0.14–0.61) when using an age classification of ≤12 versus >12 years, and 0.28 (95%CI: 0.12–0.50) when using an age classification of ≤18 versus >18 years. Conclusions/Significance Our results indicate that the overall household transmission levels of novel influenza A(H1N1) in antiviral-treated households were low in the early stage of the epidemic. The relatively high rate of adult-to-child transmission indicates that control measures focused on this transmission route will be most effective in minimizing the total number of infections."

In rmf mRNA, a Shine-Dalgarno (SD) sequence is located 11 nucleotides upstream of the initiation codon AUG. When the SD sequence was moved to the more common position 8 nucleotides upstream of the initiation codon, the degree of polyamine stimulation was reduced, although the level of RMF synthesis was markedly increased. Polyamine stimulation of RMF synthesis was found to be caused by a selective structural change of the bulged-out region of the initiation site of rmf mRNA.

In plastids, at least six assembly factors are required for heme attachment to the apo-forms of cytochrome f and cytochrome c(6) in the thylakoid lumen. CCS5, controlling plastid cytochrome c assembly, was identified through insertional mutagenesis in the unicellular green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii.

In most cases, FEN1 (flap endonuclease 1) is able to efficiently cleave short flaps as they form. However, flaps escaping cleavage bind replication protein A (RPA) inhibiting FEN1. The flaps must then be cleaved by Dna2 nuclease/helicase before FEN1 can act. Pif1 helicase aids creation of long flaps. The pathways were considered connected only in that the products of Dna2 cleavage are substrates for FEN1. However, results presented here show that Dna2, Pif1, and RPA, the unique proteins of the two-nuclease pathway from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, all stimulate FEN1 acting in the one-nuclease pathway.

Double-stranded DNA in eukaryotes is synthesized through elongation of leading and lagging strands copied using the original DNA as a template. The leading strand DNA is made in a continuous manner by DNA polymerase ϵ, which adds nucleotides in the same direction of the opening replication fork (1Kunkel T.A. Burgers P.M. Trends Cell Biol. 2008; 18: 521-527Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). The lagging strand, which grows in the opposite direction, must be made discontinuously, through the creation of short (∼150-nt) oligonucleotides known as Okazaki fragments (2Kornberg A. Baker T.A. DNA Replication. 2nd Ed. W. H. Freeman, New York1992: 113-195Google Scholar).

After adding deoxynucleotides to make the bulk of the fragment, pol δ encounters the adjacent downstream Okazaki fragment.

FEN1 is an endonuclease with a preferred substrate having a 5′-flap with a 1-nucleotide-long 3′-flap. After pol δ displaces a short flap of only a few nucleotides, FEN1 is able to bind to the 5′-end of the flap and track to its base, where it proceeds to cleave off the entire flap, leaving behind only a nick (4Liu Y.

Reconstitutions of Okazaki fragment processing in vitro suggest that FEN1 cleaves most flaps when they are only a few nucleotides long. However, in these reactions, a small fraction of flaps escape FEN1 cleavage and achieve greater lengths (11Rossi M.L. Bambara R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 26051-26061Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 12Rossi M.L. Pike J.E. Wang W. Burgers P.M. Campbell J.L. Bambara R.A. J. Biol.

Once this occurs, the flaps can be bound by replication protein A (RPA), the eukaryotic single-stranded binding protein. RPA is able to stably bind flaps greater than 22 nt in length, and doing so has been shown to inhibit FEN1 cleavage (13Fanning E. Klimovich V. Nager A.R.

Chem. 2000; 275: 38022-38031Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) proposed a second pathway through which they suggested that flaps are cleaved in vivo. In the two-nuclease pathway, cleavage by the endonuclease Dna2 is promoted on RPA-coated flaps (14Bae S.H. Bae K.H. Kim J.A. Seo Y.S. Nature. 2001; 412: 456-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). Dna2 exhibits both a directional 5′–3′ endonuclease activity and a 5′–3′ helicase activity that is specific for forked substrates (15Bae S.H. Seo Y.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38022-38031Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 16Bae S.H. Choi E. Lee K.H. Park J.S. Lee S.H. Seo Y.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26880-26890Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Like FEN1, Dna2 enters flaps from the 5′-end. However, whereas FEN1 cleaves a single time, Dna2 cleaves multiple times while tracking on the flap. Also, unlike FEN1, Dna2 is not able to cleave the flap entirely but leaves a terminal flap of 5–7 nt in length (17Kao H.I. Veeraraghavan J. Polaczek P. Campbell J.L. Bambara R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 15014-15024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). RPA is no longer able to bind these short flaps, allowing FEN1 to freely bind and cleave the remainder of the flap. Although the two-nuclease pathway was originally proposed to predominate, later reconstitutions suggest that its role is to complete processing of the small fraction of flaps that are missed by FEN1 (11Rossi M.L. Bambara R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 26051-26061Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 12Rossi M.L. Pike J.E. Wang W. Burgers P.M. Campbell J.L. Bambara R.A. J. Biol.

Chem. 2000; 275: 38022-38031Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). An additional protein, Pif1, has been implicated in lagging strand synthesis. Pif1 is a 5′–3′ helicase that has been shown to have an important role in telomere and mitochondrial DNA maintenance (18Boulé J.B. Zakian V.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: 4147-4153Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Interestingly, Pif1 has been shown to have a genetic interaction with Dna2; deletion of PIF1 rescues the lethality created by a Dna2 nuclease-deficient mutant in yeast (19Budd M.E. Reis C.C. Smith S. Myung K. Campbell J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 2490-2500Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Previous work from our research group has also suggested that Pif1 plays a role in the two-nuclease pathway by aiding the creation of longer flaps during Okazaki fragment processing (12Rossi M.L. Pike J.E. Wang W. Burgers P.M. Campbell J.L. Bambara R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 27483-27493Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 20Pike J.E. Burgers P.M. Campbell J.L. Bambara R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 25170-25180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Although originally formulated as two independent pathways, some evidence suggests that the one- and two-nuclease pathways have relevant interactions. Previous characterization of Dna2 suggests that it is able to stimulate FEN1 although indirectly. By cleaving long flaps bound by RPA, Dna2 not only removes the RPA block but also leaves short flaps that are more readily processed by FEN1 (21Stewart J.A. Campbell J.L. Bambara R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 38565-38572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 22Stewart J.A. Miller A.S. Campbell J.L. Bambara R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 31356-31365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). We therefore questioned here whether the two pathways truly operate independently (i.e. whether the protein components of the two-nuclease pathway performed no function until a flap grew to the length that would serve as a substrate for the two-nuclease pathway). In such a model, relative processing of substrates through either of the two pathways would depend solely on the fraction of flaps missed for cleavage by FEN1. Alternatively, the two pathways might be interactive, with components of one affecting the efficiency of the other. For example, the components of the two-nuclease pathway might interfere with FEN1 cleavage, helping to generate more substrate for their pathway. To test this concept, we measured the effect of the unique two-nuclease protein components on the ability of FEN1 to cleave substrates of the one-nuclease pathway. Surprising results showed that the two-nuclease proteins all stimulate FEN1 activity in a way that suppresses formation of the substrate for their own pathway. [α-32P]dCTP and [γ-32P]ATP were obtained from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Oligonucleotides were synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies (Coralville, IA). T4 polynucleotide kinase and Escherichia coli DNA polymerase I Klenow were obtained from Roche Applied Science. Other reagents were of the best grade commercially available. Saccharomyces cerevisiae Rad27 (FEN1) was cloned into the T7 expression vector pET-24b (Novagen/EMD Biosciences, Madison, WI), expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3) codon plus strain (Stratagene), and purified as described previously (23Kao H.I.

S. cerevisiae Pif1 and Pif1 K264A were cloned into the pET-28b bacterial expression vector (Novagen/EMD Biosciences), expressed in the E. coli Rosetta strain (Novagen/EMD Biosciences), and purified as described previously (24Boulé J.B. Vega L.R. Zakian V.A. Nature. 2005; 438: 57-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). S. cerevisiae RPA was overexpressed and purified from E. coli as previously described (25Sibenaller Z.A. Sorensen B.R. Wold M.S. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 12496-12506Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). S. cerevisiae Dna2 E675A was produced by site-directed mutagenesis as previously described. Wild-type Dna2 and Dna2 E675A were overexpressed and purified from baculovirus High Five cells as previously described (26Budd M.E. Choe W. Campbell J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16518-16529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Oligonucleotides were used to design substrates that simulate Okazaki fragment processing intermediates. Downstream primers of 28, 32, and 56 nt in length were annealed at their 3′-ends to a 20-nt labeling template with a 5′-GCTA overhang and radiolabeled using [α-32P]dCTP and Klenow polymerase. For 5′ labeling, the downstream primer of 28 nt was labeled with [γ-32P]ATP using polynucleotide kinase. Radiolabeled primers were separated by electrophoresis on a 15%, 7 m urea polyacrylamide gel and then gel-purified. Substrates were then created by annealing primer components in annealing buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol), heating at 95 °C for 5 min, transferring to 70 °C, and slowly cooling to room temperature. The annealing ratio was 1:2:4 (downstream primer/template/upstream primer). Each downstream primer contains a region of 26 nt complementary to the template, resulting in 2-, 6-, and 30-nt unannealed 5′-flaps, respectively. The template itself is 51 nt in length. The upstream primer is 26 nt in length, containing a 25-nt region complementary to the template, leaving a 1-nt 3′-flap. These substrates were designed to allow measurement of cleavage by FEN1. Additionally, an RNA-DNA substrate was created utilizing the above procedure. However, for the RNA-DNA substrate, the 32-nt-long downstream primer contained 12 nt of RNA in the 5′-region. Annealing resulted in a substrate with a 6-nt 5′ RNA flap and 6 nt of RNA annealed to the template. Specific substrates used in each figure are indicated in the legends and pictured at the top of the figures. The location of the radiolabel on the downstream primer is indicated by an asterisk in the respective figures. For the fixed flap cleavage reactions, one or more of the proteins, FEN1, Pif1, Dna2, or RPA, were mixed together in reaction buffer containing 30 mm HEPES, 40 mm KCl, 4 mm MgCl2, 0.01% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% inositol, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm ATP, and 5% glycerol. To start the reactions, 5 fmol of 3′-radiolabeled substrate was added for a total volume of 20 μl. Reactions were run for 10 min at 37 °C. Reactions were stopped by adding 20 μl of 2× termination dye (90% formamide (v/v), 10 mm EDTA, 0.01% bromphenol blue, and xylene cyanol), followed by heating at 95 °C for 5 min. Products were separated by electrophoresis on a 22.5%, 7 m urea polyacrylamide gel for 1 h and 40 min at 70 watts. The gel was placed on filter paper and vacuum-dried on a gel drier (Bio-Rad). Dried gels were exposed to a phosphor screen, which was scanned using a GE Healthcare PhosphorImager and analyzed with ImageQuant version 5.0 software. Binding efficiency of Pif1, RPA, or Dna2 to a substrate with a flap of either 2, 6, or 30 nt was assessed using EMSA. For clearer visualization, the 2-nt flap substrate was 5′-labeled in this experiment. Five fmol of substrate was incubated with increasing concentrations of the specific protein at either 50 or 500 fmol and incubated for 10 min at 37 °C in the same reaction buffer as described above but lacking ATP and MgCl2. The reactions were loaded on prerun, non-denaturing 12% polyacrylamide gels in 1× TBE. Gels were subjected to electrophoresis for 1.5 h at a constant 250 V. To measure the helicase activity of Pif1 or Dna2 or the strand melting activity of RPA, the respective protein was added to a reaction containing a flap substrate of either 2, 6, or 30 nt in the reaction buffer utilized for our cleavage reactions. For clearer visualization, the 2-nt flap substrate was 5′-labeled in this experiment. Five fmol of substrate was incubated with concentrations of protein of 50 or 500 fmol and incubated for 10 min at 37 °C. The reactions were terminated using a helicase dye consisting of 30% glycerol, 50 mm EDTA, 0.9% SDS, 0.125% bromphenol, and 0.125% xylene cyanol. The reactions were loaded on prerun, non-denaturing 12% polyacrylamide gels in 1× TBE. Gels were subjected to electrophoresis for 1.5 h at a constant 250 V. Purified S. cerevisiae FEN1 (1 ng) and 1 ng of a purified two-nuclease protein (S. cerevisiae Dna2, Pif1, or RPA) were allowed to bind together in a coupling buffer consisting of 25 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 10% glycerol for 2 h at 4 °C (in a 1:1 ratio). When three proteins were bound to FEN1, 2 ng of the competing proteins were added first and allowed to bind for 2 h. Then 1 ng of the antibody-specific protein was added and incubated with the mixture for an additional 2 h. Antibody to either Dna2, prepared as previously described (27Budd M.E. Campbell J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2136-2142Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar), Pif1 (sc-48377 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA)), or RPA70 (kindly provided by Dr. Marc Wold) or control IgG (sc-2027, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) were prebound to protein A-agarose for 1 h at room temperature and washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline. The bound proteins were then added to the washed protein A-agarose-antibody complex and incubated overnight at 4 °C with end-over mixing. The following day, the proteins were released from the protein A-agarose using elution buffer. The immunoprecipitates were separated on precast 4–20% gels (Bio-Rad). Western blot analysis was performed with anti-FEN1 polyclonal antibody (ab17993, Abcam). Cross-reactivity of mouse monoclonal Pif1 antibody with purified S. cerevisiae Pif1 was tested and confirmed before the immunoprecipitation. The amount of each protein used in each experiment is given in the appropriate figure legend. All enzyme assays were repeated at least in triplicate with a representative gel shown in each figure. Dna2 and RPA have been implicated in the two-nuclease pathway, important for the proper cleavage of long flaps formed during eukaryotic Okazaki fragment processing. Previous work has also shown that Pif1 helicase promotes the long flap pathway. Although the two-nuclease and FEN1-only pathways are generally represented as occurring separately from one another, we considered the possibility that the pathways have evolved to be interactive. Specifically, we set out to examine whether the components of the two-nuclease pathway influence the efficiency of the one-nuclease pathway. For our experiments, we created three substrates with flap lengths of 2, 6, or 30 nt. The 2-nt flap represents an intermediate formed during the beginning of strand displacement synthesis, which we would expect to have no affinity for Dna2, RPA, or Pif1. The 6-nt flap represents an intermediate considered at the borderline for detectable binding by the three two-nuclease pathway proteins. The 30-nt flap serves as a positive control to which all three proteins should be able to bind with maximum affinity. FEN1 is able to bind and cleave all of these flaps. By utilizing these three different lengths, we have been able to distinguish the influence of each protein on flap cleavage by FEN1 and whether that influence depends on binding of each protein to the flap. Because our experimental protocol utilized fixed flap substrates and because Dna2 and Pif1 are helicases, the potential existed that the helicase functions of these proteins would disrupt the substrates. The concern was that the helicases would partially displace the downstream primer, creating a gap. This would alter the double flap configuration favored by FEN1, decreasing FEN1 cleavage activity and masking any stimulatory effects. This is not an issue in vivo because elongation of the upstream primer by pol δ would continuously renew the favored double flap structure. To ensure that we did not experience interference, we chose a buffer system in which the helicase functions would cause minimal disruption of our substrates. Dna2 was found to stimulate FEN1 cleavage on long flaps. It has been proposed that the ability of Dna2 to cleave long 5′-flaps, terminating in a minimum flap length of about 6 nt, promotes FEN1 to cleave the remainder of the flap more efficiently. The action of Dna2 would remove regions of secondary structure in the flap that might interfere with tracking of FEN1. Moreover, Dna2 would also reduce the flap length so that RPA could not bind to interfere with FEN1 tracking. However, we were interested in determining whether Dna2 is able to directly stimulate FEN1 on the short flaps cleaved in the one-nuclease pathway. To measure whether Dna2 influences FEN1 activity, we first performed a cleavage assay. For this experiment, amounts of Dna2 ranging from 0 to 50 fmol were added to reactions containing FEN1 and varying flap length substrates. We observed a dose-dependent stimulation of FEN1 cleavage by Dna2 (Fig. 1A). Interestingly, in addition to measuring stimulation on the 30-nt flap substrate, to which Dna2 is expected to bind avidly, we also measured significant stimulation on the 6- and 2-nt flaps, implying that the ability of Dna2 to stimulate FEN1 is independent of Dna2 binding to the substrate. After adding 50 fmol of Dna2 to the reaction in the presence of ATP, we measured a stimulation of FEN1 cleavage of 12.5-fold on the 2-nt flap substrate, 44.2-fold on the 6-nt flap substrate, and 15.9-fold on the 30-nt flap substrate. Additionally, this experiment was performed in the absence of ATP. This was done to determine whether the helicase function of Dna2 is responsible for its ability to stimulate FEN1. The outcome was similar, showing that Dna2 is able to stimulate FEN1 cleavage even in the absence of helicase function. To confirm the expected binding characteristics of Dna2 to the different length flap substrates, we performed an electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) utilizing all three substrates (Fig. 1B). For these EMSA measurements, we used protein levels of 50 and 500 fmol. Whereas 50 fmol of Dna2 represents the highest amount used in our cleavage assays, to observe high efficiency binding of the protein for an EMSA, a 10-fold increase in protein (i.e. 500 fmol) was needed. In the EMSA reactions, we utilized a buffer lacking both ATP and Mg2+ to prevent unwinding or, in the case of Dna2, cleavage. At 50 fmol of Dna2, we detected no binding to the 2- and 6-nt flap substrates, and a small amount of Dna2 bound to the 30-nt flap substrate. At 500 fmol, there was little binding to the 2-nt flap substrate. More binding was observed on the 6-nt flap substrate, with the most binding occurring on the 30-nt flap substrate in the presence of 500 fmol of Dna2. This is consistent with the binding properties expected from Dna2. Finally, we performed a helicase assay utilizing the nuclease-deficient mutant of Dna2. Although the absence of ATP negated the helicase activity of Dna2 in the cleavage assay, the helicase assay was performed in conditions that allowed for maximal helicase activity by the nuclease-deficient Dna2 mutant. Although Dna2 did not show stable binding to the short flap substrates in our EMSA study, we envisioned that there could be transient binding of Dna2 to these substrates, allowing for some helicase activity. However, at 50 fmol of Dna2, the maximum amount used in our cleavage assay, we saw only minimal unwinding and only on the 30-nt flap (Fig. 2). Even at 500 fmol of Dna2, unwinding of the downstream primer could only be observed on the 30-nt flap, suggesting that robust helicase activity by Dna2 requires a longer single-stranded DNA region for it to track and unwind the substrate. This confirms that although Dna2 can stimulate FEN1 cleavage on short flaps, it cannot perform its helicase or endonuclease functions. Pif1 has previously been shown to promote utilization of the two-nuclease pathway in reconstitution reactions. Because it appears to be a two-nuclease pathway component, we assessed the ability of Pif1 to stimulate FEN1 on short flaps. As with Dna2, we first performed a cleavage assay, now utilizing FEN1 and Pif1. Varying amounts of Pif1, ranging from 0 to 50 fmol, were added to reactions containing FEN1. Results revealed a dose-dependent stimulation of FEN1 cleavage by Pif1 (Fig. 3A). As with Dna2, stimulation of FEN1 occurred not only for cleavage of the 30-nt flap substrate but also with the 6- and 2-nt flap substrates. This implies that the ability of Pif1 to stimulate FEN1 is not dependent on Pif1 binding to the flap. The addition of 50 fmol of Pif1 to the reaction resulted in a stimulation of FEN1 cleavage by 16.6-fold on the 2-nt flap substrate, 10.5-fold on the 6-nt flap substrate, and 9.4-fold on the 30-nt flap substrate. A similar experiment was also performed in the absence of ATP to determine whether the helicase function of Pif1 is in any way responsible for its ability to stimulate FEN1. We observed that, like Dna2, Pif1 is able to stimulate FEN1 cleavage even in the absence of ATP. A Pif1 helicase-deficient mutant was also utilized to further confirm that the stimulation of FEN1 by Pif1 does not require its helicase function (data not shown). We expected that Pif1 would exhibit weak binding to a 2- or 6-nt flap but would bind avidly to a 30-nt flap. To confirm, we performed an EMSA utilizing all three substrates in the presence of Pif1 (Fig. 3B). We observed a very low level of binding on the 2-nt flap, even at 500 fmol of protein. As expected, the amount of binding increased on the 6-nt flap, although the amount of Pif1 bound was still low. On the 30-nt flap, binding was evident even at 50 fmol of Pif1 and even more efficient at 500 fmol of Pif1. This result is consistent with our expectation that Pif1 would bind poorly to the short flap substrates, if at all, but readily to the 30-nt flap substrate. In order to determine how the helicase of Pif1 is functioning on the different length flaps utilized in our previous assays, we performed a helicase assay. In addition to characterizing the helicase ability of Pif1, we also sought to confirm that Pif1 was not disrupting our substrates by removing the downstream primer. At 50 fmol of Pif1, the maximum amount used in our cleavage assay, we saw minimal unwinding of the downstream primer and only on the 30-nt flap (Fig. 2). This level of Pif1 was chosen intentionally with the expectation that it would not disrupt the substrate. At the higher concentration of 500 fmol, however, Pif1 displayed helicase activity, most effective on the 30-nt flap substrate, with some unwinding on the 6-nt flap. This confirms what we expected; there is no helicase activity of Pif1 directly on the 2-nt flap and minimal activity on the 6-nt flap, and Pif1 is able to freely interact with the 30-nt flap. This pattern of unwinding is consistent with our hypothesis that Pif1, on short flaps, is at first working to stimulate FEN1 cleavage. However, after a critical flap length is reached, Pif1 is able to bind to the flap, allowing its helicase function to act. This allows Pif1 to lengthen the flap, thereby biasing the processing of the flap toward the two-nuclease pathway. RPA is a key component of the Okazaki fragment maturation pathway, responsible for switching processing from the one-nuclease pathway to the two-nuclease pathway via binding of the flaps. To better understand these actions of RPA, we measured regulation of FEN1 by RPA on the same substrates that revealed stimulation of FEN1 by Dna2 and Pif1. Amounts of RPA ranging from 0 to 100 fmol were added to reactions containing FEN1. This resulted in a dose-dependent stimulation of FEN1 cleavage by RPA (Fig. 4A). On the 2- and 6-nt flap substrates, to which RPA cannot stably bind, FEN1 cleavage was increased by 9.3- and 8.3-fold, respectively, at 100 fmol of RPA. For the 30-nt flap substrate, we included two additional, higher amounts of RPA, 200 and 300 fmol. This allowed us to measure the expected inhibition of FEN1 by RPA on long flaps. At lower levels, RPA was indeed able to stimulate FEN1 cleavage; there was a 2-fold stimulation of FEN1 cleavage at 100 fmol of RPA. However, at 300 fmol of RPA, at which we expected stable coating of the flap, FEN1 cleavage was inhibited to 25% of its basal level. As"

However, despite the above observations, self-acylation of a protein constituting part of the catalytic acyl transfer mechanism, even though postulated for several other enzymatic reactions including lysophosphatidylcholine:lysophosphatidylcholine acyltransferase and class II tumor suppressor H-Rev107, has yet to be directly documented for this class of enzymes (18Pérez-Gil J.

In this study, we employed mass spectrometry to investigate formation of a covalent acyl-enzyme intermediate and determine the site of putative modification. Additionally, we examined the influence of changes in the acyl chain length at the sn-1 position of phosphatidylcholine and the surrounding lipid phase on LRAT enzymatic activity and formation of the enzyme-bound intermediate.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESProtein Expression and PurificationMouse LRAT cDNA encoding amino acids 30GGG…TVK186 was subcloned into a pGEX_2T vector (GE Healthcare) using BamHI and EcoRI restriction sites to generate the glutathione S-transferase fusion protein GST-tLRAT. This fusion protein then was expressed in the Bl21(DE3) Escherichia coli strain. Bacteria were grown in the presence of 50 μm ampicillin and induced with 0.5 mm isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside. Protein expression was carried out at 22 °C for 5 h. The bacteria were harvested, treated with lysozyme, and disrupted by osmotic shock (20Burger A. Berendes R. Voges D. Huber R. Demange P. FEBS Lett. 1993; 329: 25-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Bacterial crude lysate was centrifuged at 36,000 × g at 4 °C for 30 min. The soluble fraction, after adjustment of its salt composition with 67 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, and 50 mm NaCl, was incubated with glutathione-Sepharose (GE Healthcare) for 3 h at 4 °C. The resin then was placed in a chromatography column and washed with 10 column volumes of 67 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, and 50 mm NaCl. GST-tLRAT fusion protein was eluted with 10 mm reduced glutathione in 10 mm Tris/HCl buffer, pH 8.0. Fractions containing the protein were pooled together, concentrated at a Centricon (Amicon) cutoff of 30 kDa, and loaded onto a SRT SEC-300 size exclusion column (Sepax Technologies) equilibrated with 10 mm Tris/HCl buffer, pH 8.0. Eluted protein was concentrated again to ∼5 mg/ml and stored at −80 °C. Thrombin digestion of GST-tLRAT was performed in 10 mm Tris/HCl buffer, pH 8.0, at room temperature for 1 h by using 2 units of thrombin activity/1 mg of protein.LRAT Enzymatic and Self-acylation AssaysAcyltransferase activity was assayed in 10 mm Tris/HCl buffer, pH 8.0, 1 mm DTT, and 1% BSA with 10 μg of purified GST-tLRAT protein or UV-treated bovine retinal pigment epithelium microsomes (300 μg of total protein) isolated as described previously (21Stecher H. Gelb M.H. Saari J.C. Palczewski K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8577-8585Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The reaction was initiated by the addition of variable amounts of PC along with 10 μm all-trans-retinol delivered in 1 μl of dimethylformamide to a total volume of 0.2 ml. PCs containing eight or more carbon acyls were delivered in liposomes formed by sonication of a lipid film in 10 mm Tris/HCl buffer, pH 8.0. The reaction mixture was vigorously vortexed and incubated at 37 °C for 20 min and then quenched with 0.3 ml of methanol and extracted with 0.3 ml of hexane. Retinoid composition in the organic fraction was analyzed on a normal phase silica column (Zorbax Sil 5 μm, 4.6 × 250 mm) (Agilent Technology) by using a mobile phase composed of 10% ethyl acetate in hexane at a flow rate of 1.4 ml/min. Alternatively, to ensure separation of retinyl esters containing acyl chains of different length, a step gradient of ethyl acetate in hexane was used (0.5% for the initial 15 min and then 20% up to 25 min.). Individual retinoids were detected and quantified based on their UV-visible spectra. Self-acylation of tLRAT was detected after incubation of the protein sample with various PC substrates in 5 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, and 1 mm DTT.Mass Spectrometry AnalysisAll of the experiments were performed with a LXQ linear ion trap mass spectrometer equipped with an electrospray ionization source (Thermo Scientific). An Agilent Technologies 1100 Series HPLC system (Agilent Technology) was interfaced with the mass spectrometer for online protein/peptide separation. To record spectra of intact proteins, ∼2 μg of the protein was loaded onto a C8 cartridge column (Luna 5 μm, 20 × 2.0 mm; Fenomenex) and eluted with a linear 10–100% gradient of acetonitrile/water over 20 min at a flow rate of 0.2 ml/min. Both solvents contained 0.1% formic acid. Because the chromatographic separation served as a desalting step, the initial 2 min of each run were directed to waste. Intact protein masses were deconvoluted either by use of ProMass for Xcaliber software (Thermo Scientific) or manually for selected peaks. The same column and solvents were used to separate products of trypsin and pepsin digestion except the acetonitrile gradient was developed within 40 min. Because the thioester bond might be chemically unstable under acidic conditions, pepsin digestion in solution was performed at 4 °C, pH 2.0, for 15 min followed by immediate injection onto the column. Trypsin digestion in solution was performed in 5 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, for 16 h at 37 °C.RESULTSExpression and Purification of LRAT-GST Fusion ProteinTo establish a source of LRAT suitable for MS experiments, we expressed a truncated mouse enzyme (tLRAT) containing residues 30–186 in the form of a GST fusion protein in E. coli (Fig. 1, A and B). Importantly, affinity-purified GST-tLRAT protein did not require detergent to remain soluble, and it also exhibited robust enzymatic activity when assayed in the presence of short acyl chain PC and all-trans-retinol (Fig. 1, C and D).Covalent LRAT Modification upon Incubation with PCThe first step of the proposed catalytic reaction involves acyl-group transfer from PC and concomitant formation of an acyl-enzyme intermediate (supplemental Fig. S1). To detect putative enzyme modification, electrospray ionization-MS analyses were carried out first with intact protein where the charge state distribution of the protein ions provided information about the polypeptide mass. The purified protein spectrum recorded under acidic conditions revealed a broad distribution of charged states, which correspond to a protein with a calculated mass of 44,672 Da, identical to the theoretical mass of GST-tLRAT (Fig. 2A and supplemental Fig. S2). Incubation of GST-tLRAT with PC led to rapid modification of the protein indicated by the appearance of an additional series of peaks in the mass spectra. Two representative examples are shown in Fig. 2 and supplemental Fig. S3. The presence of 7:0 PC caused a 112-Da shift in the deconvoluted mass of this protein, suggesting covalent modification of GST-tLRAT with the C7 fatty acid moiety (Fig. 2, B and D). There was excellent agreement between the experimentally obtained and calculated mass with an increase in mass adequate to accommodate the length of an acyl chain in a variety of tested substrates (Table 1). The additional mass peak at 44,542 Da seen in the spectrum of unmodified protein corresponds to the N-terminal Met cleavage product (mass difference = 130 ± 2 Da) (Fig. 2D). Incomplete removal of N-terminal Met is caused by a Pro residue present in the P2′ position within the GST amino acid sequence (22Frottin F. Martinez A. Peynot P. Mitra S. Holz R.C. Giglione C. Meinnel T. Mol. Cell Proteomics. 2006; 5: 2336-2349Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). To confirm that acylation occurs within the tLRAT portion of the fusion protein after incubation with PC, GST-tLRAT was treated with thrombin, and liberated peptides were separated chromatographically. Cleavage of the GST tag revealed that the site of modification was located within the tLRAT sequence (supplemental Fig. S4).FIGURE 2Electrospray ionization mass spectra of intact GST-tLRAT. A, purified protein spectrum shows a broad distribution of charged states (27+ to 69+). Deconvolution of GST-tLRAT spectrum reveals a protein mass of 44,672 Da (inset), which is identical to the theoretical mass of GST-tLRAT. B, incubation of the protein with 1 mm of 7:0 PC led to a 112-Da shift in experimentally obtained protein mass (inset). C, zoomed spectrum displays a group of selected multiply charged protein ions for the unmodified and acylated protein. Upon incubation with 0.3 mm of 7:0 PC, the protein became covalently modified as indicated by an additional peak at the higher m/z values marked by asterisks. D, deconvoluted mass spectrum of purified GST-tLRAT (black trace) reveals an additional peak at 44,542 Da corresponding to the N-terminal Met cleavage product (Δ = 130 ± 2 Da). The red trace represents protein mass upon incubation with the lipid substrate. The 112-Da shift in mass indicates covalent protein modification with a C7 acyl chain.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)TABLE 1Determination of protein masses by electrospray ionization MSProteinDeconvoluted massCalculated average massDaDaGST-tLRAT44,672.4 ± 244,672GST-tLRAT (6:0)44,769.2 ± 244,770GST-tLRAT (7:0)44,783.6 ± 244,784GST-tLRAT (8:0)44,796.0 ± 244,798GST-tLRAT (9:0)44,811.0 ± 144,812tLRAT18,522.4 ± 118,523tLRAT (6:0)18,621.0 ± 218,621tLRAT (7:0)18,635.6 ± 218,635 Open table in a new tab Identification of Acylated Amino Acid Side ChainThe relatively stable nature of LRAT self-acylation permitted identification of the acylated residue. Combined sequence coverage for tLRAT upon trypsin and pepsin digestion reached 90% and included all Cys and Ser residues present in the sequence. Detailed analysis of MS data revealed the addition of an acyl group to Cys161 in a peptide containing the conserved NCEHF sequence characteristic for the LRAT-like protein family (158WNNCEHFVTY167) upon incubation with lipid substrates. To gain more confidence in this result, the same experiment was repeated for a number of PCs with acyl chains of differing length. Fig. 3 shows a comparison of tandem MS spectra for unmodified peptide and peptides with C6 and C8 fatty acyls. Differences in acyl chain length between lipid substrates were documented by 28-Da shifts in a series of corresponding b and y ions. Comparison of fragmentation patterns of differently modified peptides is especially important because thioester modifications often do not produce a marker or neutral loss ions; therefore backbone fragmentation appears to be the primary way of peptide decomposition (23Hoffman M.D. Kast J. J. Mass Spectrom. 2006; 41: 229-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In conclusion, we directly demonstrated that LRAT forms transient thioester bonds during enzymatic activity, providing proof for previous hypotheses.FIGURE 3Determination of the acylation site by tandem MS. The spectra were recorded for the 2+ precursor ion of a peptide containing Cys161. The protein modification upon incubation with PC caused a shift in masses corresponding to a series of y and b ions shown in blue and red for 6:0 PC and 8:0 PC, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Effect of Lipid Phase on tLRAT Enzymatic ActivityBy studying the relationship between LRAT activity and the length of the sn-1 fatty acyl moiety of its phosphatidylcholine substrates, we found that the soluble form of tLRAT catalyzed the most efficient retinyl ester formation in the presence of PCs with short chain fatty acids, whereas increasing the acyl chain length resulted in gradual loss of enzymatic activity accompanied by inefficient formation of the thioester intermediate (Fig. 4, A and B). In contrast to the soluble form of the protein, enzymatic assays performed in the presence of full-length, membrane-anchored protein revealed that LRAT preferentially utilized lipid substrates with long acyl chains such as externally added C12 and endogenous C16 rather than those with shorter chains (Fig. 4C). Moreover, LRAT is known to efficiently transfer C14, C16, and C18 fatty acyls onto retinoids in vivo (14Golczak M. Imanishi Y. Kuksa V. Maeda T. Kubota R. Palczewski K. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 42263-42273Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Thus, this discrepancy has the potential to reveal other interesting mechanistic properties of this enzyme. We found a simple correlation between aqueous solubility of lipid in monomeric form and its ability to be utilized by LRAT. Aggregation of PC monomers above their critical micelle concentrations inhibited acyltransferase activity and protein acylation, indicating that the lipid-water interface of the micellar aggregates is not accessible or does not bind to the truncated enzyme (supplemental Fig. S5).FIGURE 4Correlation between enzyme acylation, its enzymatic activity and critical micelle concentration values of tested lipid substrates. A and B, formation of acyl-intermediates in GST-tLRAT (marked with asterisk in A) correlates with transfer of the acyl group to retinol observed in enzymatic assays (B). An increase in fatty acyl chain length markedly reduced the catalytic activity of soluble tLRAT. This decrease in enzymatic activity correlated with the declining concentration of monomeric lipid substrate as determined by critical micelle concentration values. The critical micelle concentration values for each of the tested PCs are cited from the Avanti Lipids Polar database available on the company website. The lipid concentration in each experimental set was fixed at 1 mm. C, enzymatic activity of the full-length, membrane-bound LRAT in the presence of lipid substrates with fatty acyl chains of different lengths. UV-treated bovine retinal pigment epithelium microsomes were incubated with 200 μm of tested PCs and 10 μm all-trans-retinol for 20 min at 37 °C, and retinoid composition was subsequently examined by HPLC. Chromatogram signals were normalized with respect to the intensity of a retinyl palmitate peak.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)DISCUSSIONThe mass spectrometry approach used in this study was designed to directly test the catalytic mechanism of LRAT and avoid the obvious disadvantages of site-directed mutagenesis, especially in loss-of-function experiments. LRAT was proposed to be mechanically related to thiol proteases. However, instead of hydrolysis of an acyl-enzyme intermediate by water, the fatty acyl moiety is transferred to retinol (17Jahng W.J. Xue L. Rando R.R. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 12805-12812Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Thus, water needs to be excluded from the active site of the protein, allowing stabilization of the thioester intermediate in the absence of retinol. Consequently, the catalytic mechanism can be tested directly without using acetylating suicide inhibitors. Identification of an acylation site on highly conserved Cys161 suggests its importance in enzymatic activities of diverse LRAT protein family members. Recently, three other members of the family, tazarotene-induced protein 3 and H-Ras-like suppressor family 2 and 3, were shown to exhibit phospholipase A1/2 activity (19Uyama T. Morishita J. Jin X.H. Okamoto Y. Tsuboi K. Ueda N. J. Lipid Res. 2009; 50: 685-693Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 24Han B.G. Cho J.W. Cho Y.D. Kim S.Y. Yoon H.J. Song H.K. Cheong H.K. Jeon Y.H. Lee D.K. Lee S. Lee B.I. Protein Expr. Purif. 2010; 71: 103-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Thus, the experimental strategy used here could be employed for rapid identification of putative acyltransferases in the remaining members of the LRAT-like-containing domain protein family.By studying the relationship between PC fatty acyl chain length and tLRAT enzymatic activity, we found that monomeric lipid substrates are preferred by this enzyme. Therefore, LRAT, unlike many other lipolytic enzymes including phospholipase A2, is not activated by phospholipid interfaces but instead exhibits features characteristic of esterases rather than lipases. This observation in turn suggests that in the case of LRAT, the C-terminal membrane-anchoring domain is important for targeting the protein to the endoplasmic reticulum and also determines the accessibility of long chain fatty acyl substrates for catalysis by this membrane-bound enzyme. The latter conclusion is further supported by the experiment in which LRAT embedded in retinal pigment epithelium microsomes preferentially accepted long acyl chain PCs that more readily partition into the membrane phase (Fig. 4C).In conclusion, this study provides insights into the catalytic mechanism of LRAT by providing the first direct evidence for an enzyme-bound thioester intermediate (Fig. 5). Moreover, it presents an important mechanistic observation about the role of the surrounding lipid phase in the substrate availability and enzymatic activity of LRAT. This information may help elucidate and verify the largely unknown biological functions of the LRAT-like protein family as well as serve as a model for studies of lipolytic enzymes that might employ a similar catalytic mechanism.FIGURE 5Schematic representation of LRAT enzymatic activity mechanism.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) IntroductionA representative member of the NlpC/P60 superfamily (1Anantharaman V.

https://openalex.org/W1968022727,"Progressive sensorineural hearing loss is the most common form of acquired hearing impairment in the human population. It is also highly prevalent in inbred strains of mice, providing an experimental avenue to systematically map genetic risk factors and to dissect the molecular pathways that orchestrate hearing in peripheral sensory hair cells. Therefore, we ascertained hearing function in the inbred long sleep (ILS) and inbred short sleep (ISS) strains. Using auditory-evoked brain stem response (ABR) and distortion product otoacoustic emission (DPOAE) measurements, we found that ISS mice developed a high-frequency hearing loss at twelve weeks of age that progressed to lower frequencies by 26 weeks of age in the presence of normal endocochlear potentials and unremarkable inner ear histology. ILS mice exhibited milder hearing loss, showing elevated thresholds and reduced DPOAEs at the higher frequencies by 26 weeks of age. To map the genetic variants that underlie this hearing loss we computed ABR thresholds of 63 recombinant inbred stains derived from the ISS and ILS founder strains. A single locus was linked to markers associated with ISS alleles on chromosome 10 with a highly significant logarithm of odds (LOD) score of 15.8. The 2-LOD confidence interval spans ∼4 Megabases located at position 54–60 Mb. This locus, termed sensorineural hearing loss 1 (Snhl1), accounts for approximately 82% of the phenotypic variation. In summary, this study identifies a novel hearing loss locus on chromosome 10 and attests to the prevalence and genetic heterogeneity of progressive hearing loss in common mouse strains."
https://openalex.org/W1973803211,"Mutations in the human kidney anion exchanger 1 (kAE1) membrane glycoprotein cause impaired urine acidification resulting in distal renal tubular acidosis (dRTA). Dominant and recessive dRTA kAE1 mutants exhibit distinct trafficking defects with retention in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), Golgi, or mislocalization to the apical membrane in polarized epithelial cells. We examined the interaction of kAE1 with the quality control system responsible for the folding of membrane glycoproteins and the retention and degradation of misfolded mutants. Using small molecule inhibitors to disrupt chaperone interactions, two functional, dominant kAE1 mutants (R589H and R901stop), retained in the ER and targeted to the proteasome for degradation by ubiquitination, were rescued to the basolateral membrane of Madin-Darby canine kidney cells. In contrast, the Golgi-localized, recessive G701D and the severely misfolded, ER-retained dominant Southeast Asian ovalocytosis (SAO) mutants were not rescued. These results show that functional dRTA mutants are retained in the ER due to their interaction with molecular chaperones, particularly calnexin, and that disruption of these interactions can promote their escape from the ER and cell surface rescue."
https://openalex.org/W1999829059,"Acute Lung Injury (ALI) carries about 50 percent mortality and is frequently associated with an infection (sepsis). Life-support treatment with mechanical ventilation rescues many patients, although superimposed infection or multiple organ failure can result in death. The outcome of a patient developing sepsis depends on two factors: the infection and the pre-existing inflammation. In this study, we described each stage of the inflammation process using a transcriptional approach and an animal model. Female C57BL6/J mice received an intravenous oleic acid injection to induce an acute lung injury (ALI). Lung expression patterns were analyzed using a 9900 cDNA mouse microarray (MUSV29K). Our gene-expression analysis revealed marked changes in the immune and inflammatory response metabolic pathways, notably lipid metabolism and transcription. The early stage (1 hour–1.5 hours) is characterized by a pro-inflammatory immune response. Later (3 hours–4 hours), the immune cells migrate into inflamed tissues through interaction with vascular endothelial cells. Finally, at late stages of lung inflammation (18 hours–24 hours), metabolism is deeply disturbed. Highly expressed pro-inflammatory cytokines activate transcription of many genes and lipid metabolism. In this study, we described a global overview of critical events occurring during lung inflammation which is essential to understand infectious pathologies such as sepsis where inflammation and infection are intertwined. Based on these data, it becomes possible to isolate the impact of a pathogen at the transcriptional level from the global gene expression modifications resulting from the infection associated with the inflammation."

Previous studies indicate that endogenous ErbB3 protein is markedly elevated in mouse mammary tumors induced by transgenic ErbB2 overexpression. However, this occurs in the absence of elevated ErbB3 transcript, indicating that post-transcriptional regulatory mechanisms play crucial roles in suppressing ErbB3 protein in normal tissue. Our previous studies also demonstrate that protein levels of Nrdp1, an E3 ubiquitin ligase that targets ErbB3 for degradation, are markedly suppressed in tumors from ErbB2 transgenic animals relative to normal tissue. Here we demonstrate that transgenic expression of Nrdp1 cDNA in the mouse mammary gland is not sufficient to suppress elevated ErbB3 levels or tumor initiation and growth in ErbB2 transgenic mice. Unexpectedly, Nrdp1 protein is absent in tumors from Nrdp1/ErbB2 bigenic mice, and real time PCR analysis indicates that Nrdp1 protein levels are suppressed post-transcriptionally. Nrdp1 protein is more resistant to proteasome-dependent degradation when exogenously expressed in cultured MCF10A nontransformed human breast epithelial cells than in breast tumor cells. These observations indicate that mammary tumors use potent post-transcriptional mechanisms to suppress Nrdp1 protein levels and that protein destabilization may play a central role in Nrdp1 loss in tumors.

Overexpression and aberrant activation of members of the ErbB family of receptor tyrosine kinases are thought to contribute to the development and progression of a variety of tumor types (1Holbro T. Civenni G. Hynes N.E. Exp. Cell Res. 2003; 284: 99-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar). Notably, amplification of the erbB2 gene is observed in 25–30% of breast cancer patients, and overexpression of the ErbB2 protein correlates with earlier relapse and poor prognosis (2Slamon D.J.

Numerous studies with cultured cells suggest that overexpression of the ErbB2 protein is sufficient to activate its protein-tyrosine kinase activity, which is necessary for ErbB2-induced cellular transformation. ErbB2 overexpression in the mouse mammary gland is sufficient to induce the formation of metastatic tumors (4Guy C.T. Webster M.A. Schaller M. Parsons T.J. Cardiff R.D. Muller W.J. Proc. Natl. Acad.

These observations have pointed to a central role for ErbB2 in breast tumor initiation and progression, and ErbB2-directed antibody and small molecule inhibitors are currently employed clinically in the treatment of breast cancer (5Pal S.K.

Members of the ErbB family take part in a complex array of combinatorial interactions through the formation homo- and heterodimers between the different family members, which in turn activate distinct signaling pathways (7Carraway 3rd, K.L.

It has been suggested that signaling by the ErbB2-ErbB3 heterodimer is the most potent of the 10 ErbB receptor dimeric complexes (11Citri A. Skaria K.B. Yarden Y. Exp. Cell Res. 2003; 284: 54-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar), and the ErbB2-ErbB3 complex is a proposed oncogenic unit (12Holbro T. Beerli R.R. Maurer F. Koziczak M. Barbas 3rd, C.F. Hynes N.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2003; 100: 8933-8938Crossref PubMed Scopus (778) Google Scholar). Recent evidence supports a central role for ErbB3 in ErbB2-amplified breast cancer (13Lee-Hoeflich S.T. Crocker L. Yao E. Pham T. Munroe X. Hoeflich K.P. Sliwkowski M.X. Stern H.M. Cancer Res. 2008; 68: 5878-5887Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar), and several reports point to roles for ErbB3 activation in mediating resistance to cancer therapeutics (14Stern D.F. J.

Together these observations strongly suggest that ErbB3 function is an important aspect of ErbB2-mediated breast cancer, prompting the need for a more thorough understanding of ErbB3 expression and dysregulation in breast cancer. Transgenic mouse models have demonstrated that ErbB2 overexpression in the mammary gland using the MMTV 4The abbreviation used is: MMTVmurine mammary tumor. promoter/enhancer is sufficient to induce to metastatic cancer (4Guy C.T.

The prolonged latency of tumor development in these animals relative to mammary tumors driven by more potent oncogenes suggests that other rate-limiting processes also contribute to tumor onset. For example, it has been demonstrated that the acquisition of deletions in ErbB2 that facilitate its homodimerization through extracellular disulfide bonding is required for ErbB2-induced tumorigenesis (22Siegel P.M. Dankort D.L. Hardy W.R. Muller W.J. Mol. Cell Biol. 1994; 14: 7068-7077Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 23Pedersen K. Angelini P.D. Laos S. Bach-Faig A. Cunningham M.P. Ferrer-Ramón C.

However, transgenic expression of these mutants in the mammary gland still exhibit prolonged latencies (24Siegel P.M. Ryan E.D. Cardiff R.D. Muller W.J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2149-2164Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar), suggesting the involvement of other processes. murine mammary tumor. Interestingly, the vast majority of tumors from transgenic animals that overexpress ErbB2 also overexpress endogenous ErbB3 protein by well over 10-fold relative to normal tissue (16Yen L. Cao Z. Wu X. Ingalla E.R. Baron C. Young L.J. Gregg J.P. Cardiff R.D. Borowsky A.D. Sweeney C. Carraway 3rd, K.L. Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 11279-11286Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 24Siegel P.M.

Remarkably, elevated ErbB3 protein is observed in tumors, even though transcript levels are similar to uninvolved (normal) tissue from the same animals (16Yen L. Cao Z. Wu X. Ingalla E.R. Baron C.

These observations indicate that normal mammary tissue utilizes potent post-transcriptional mechanisms to keep ErbB3 protein levels in check and that tumors disrupt these mechanisms to create a permissive environment for receptor overexpression (26Carraway 3rd, K.L.

Nrdp1 is a RING finger ubiquitin ligase that has been demonstrated to mediate the ubiquitination and degradation of ErbB3 to regulate steady-state (ligand independent) receptor levels (28Diamonti A.J. Guy P.M. Ivanof C. Wong K. Sweeney C. Carraway 3rd, K.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2002; 99: 2866-2871Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 29Qiu X.B. Goldberg A.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2002; 99: 14843-14848Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Overexpression of Nrdp1 in cultured cells suppresses ErbB3 levels, whereas overexpression of a dominant-negative form or knockdown of endogenous Nrdp1 elevates ErbB3 (16Yen L. Cao Z. Wu X. Ingalla E.R. Baron C. Young L.J. Gregg J.P. Cardiff R.D. Borowsky A.D. Sweeney C. Carraway 3rd, K.L. Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 11279-11286Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Interestingly, Nrdp1 protein is consistently lost in mammary tumors from ErbB2-overexpressing transgenic mice, and we have observed a strong inverse correlation in the levels of Nrdp1 and ErbB3 proteins in breast cancer patient primary tumors (16Yen L. Cao Z. Wu X. Ingalla E.R. Baron C. Young L.J. Gregg J.P. Cardiff R.D. Borowsky A.D. Sweeney C. Carraway 3rd, K.L. Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 11279-11286Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). These observations raise the possibility that the suppression of Nrdp1 protein by breast tumors contributes to malignancy by allowing ErbB3 overexpression. In this study we set out to test the prediction that restoration of Nrdp1 to mouse mammary tumors suppresses ErbB3 levels, increases tumor latency, and lowers tumor burden in transgenic mice with ErbB2-induced mammary tumors. Unexpectedly, we find that transgenic expression is not a viable approach to the restoration of Nrdp1 to ErbB2 overexpression-induced mouse mammary tumors because tumors employ potent post-transcriptional mechanisms to suppress both endogenous and transgene-derived Nrdp1 protein. Our observations suggest that tumors dysregulate mechanisms involved in maintaining Nrdp1 protein stability. All of the mouse procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of California, Davis. The cDNA encoding human Nrdp1 was subcloned into the HindIII and EcoRI restriction sites of MMTV-LTR vector, and immunofluorescence microscopy of transiently transfected MMTV-Nrdp1 or MMTV-GFP plasmids was used to confirm MMTV-LTR-driven expression in dexamethasone-treated cells as previously described (30Funes M.

ScaI-linearized plasmid was injected into fertilized FvB mouse eggs, which were transplanted into pseudopregnant females. Potential founder animals were screened by PCR analysis of tail DNA using primers GCTGTCCTGCTTCTATTGT (forward) and GCAGTAGCCTCATCATCAC (reverse), and founders were confirmed by Southern blotting. Three independent transgenic lines were established by mating founder animals with wild type mice. Both FvB MMTV-Nrdp1 and MMTV-NDL mice overexpressing the rat ErbB2 transgene (NDL2–5; 24) were bred and maintained at the animal facilities at the University of California, Davis. For aging studies, the mice were palpated to identify mammary tumors every other week from 15 to 19 weeks of age and then weekly from 20 to 60 weeks of age. Following tumor development, mammary fat pads were collected for whole mount and immunohistochemical analysis. In addition, dissected tumor and adjacent normal fat pad tissues were collected following tumor development in these mice and snap frozen in liquid nitrogen for RNA and protein analysis. MCF10A, BT474, and MDA-MB-231 cells were obtained from ATCC and grown in the recommended media. The derivation and growth of the NDL cell line were described previously (25Miller J.K. Shattuck D.L.

For proteasome inhibitor experiments, cells stably transduced with pMX-pie or pMX-pie-Nrdp1 retroviruses (16Yen L. Cao Z. Wu X. Ingalla E.R. Baron C. Young L.J. Gregg J.P. Cardiff R.D. Borowsky A.D.

Whole cell lysates were resolved by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted as described below. For half-life experiments, transduced cells were treated with 50 μm cycloheximide for various times, and whole cell lysates were immunoblotted with antibodies to FLAG and actin. Mammary fat pads from transgenic mice were homogenized as described (25Miller J.K. Shattuck D.L. Ingalla E.Q. Yen L. Borowsky A.D. Young L.J. Cardiff R.D. Carraway 3rd, K.L. Sweeney C. Cancer Res. 2008; 68: 8286-8294Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). 20 μg of total protein was then collected in sample buffer (62.5 mm Tris-HCl, 2% SDS, 5% β-mercaptoethanol, 10% glycerol, 0.05% bromphenol blue), boiled for 5 min at 95 °C, and resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE. Following transfer to nitrocellulose (Pall Life Science), the proteins were immunoblotted with various primary antibodies, detected using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Invitrogen), and developed using SuperSignal West chemicals (Pierce). An Alpha Innotech imaging station with FluorChem FC2 software was used to capture and quantify immunoblotting images. The antibodies used in these studies include: FLRF/Nrdp1 (Bethyl, Inc.), affinity-purified rabbit Nrdp1 previously described (28Diamonti A.J. Guy P.M. Ivanof C. Wong K. Sweeney C. Carraway 3rd, K.L.

MCF10A and MDA-MB-231 cells on coverslips were transiently transduced with pMXpie-Nrdp1 retroviral particles (16Yen L. Cao Z. Wu X. Ingalla E.R. Baron C. Young L.J. Gregg J.P. Cardiff R.D.

Three days following transduction, the cells were fixed and processed for immunofluorescence as described previously (30Funes M. Miller J.K. Lai C. Carraway 3rd, K.L. Sweeney C. J. Biol.

For direct comparisons among cell lines, camera shutter times and imaging parameters were kept constant for all samples. Tail genomic DNA was collected by NaOH extraction. Extraction of RNA from mouse tissues, cDNA synthesis, and real time PCR analysis were all carried out as previously described (25Miller J.K. Shattuck D.L. Ingalla E.Q. Yen L. Borowsky A.D. Young L.J. Cardiff R.D. Carraway 3rd, K.L. Sweeney C. Cancer Res. 2008; 68: 8286-8294Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Exogenous and endogenous Nrdp1 transcript in mouse tissues was quantified using forward primer TGAACCGACGCTACTATGAGAACT, reverse primer CTGGTTCTCACAGGCCATCAC, and probe 6FAM-TGGCCAAGCGCATCCCTGG-MGBNFQ. Mouse and human ErbB3 and actin real time primers and probes were purchased from ABI. Nrdp1 and ErbB3 transcript content in tissue samples were normalized to actin. T cell receptor delta gene reference was quantified using forward primer CAGACTGGTTATCTGCAAAGCAA, reverse primer TCTATGCCAGTTCCAAAAAACATC, and probe 6FAM-ATTATAACGTGCTCCTGGGACACCC-MGBNFQ. All of the tissues were fixed in 10% formalin and processed by the Pathology Laboratory of the University of California, Davis. Four-micrometer-thick paraffin sections were stained with Mayer's hematoxilin and eosin. Images of slides were captured using 4×, 20×, and 40× objectives on a Zeiss Axioskop microscope with an Axiocam camera and Axiovision 3.1 software. Mammary whole mounts were prepared as previously described (32Rasmussen S.B. Young L.J. Smith G.H. Ip M.M. Asch B. Methods in Mammary Gland Biology and Breast Cancer Research. Kluwer Academic/Plenum Publishers, New York2000: 75-85Crossref Google Scholar), and the images were collected using an Epson scanner and processed using Adobe Photoshop 7.0 software. To test the hypothesis that Nrdp1 restoration to ErbB2-induced mouse mammary tumors will suppress tumor onset by lowering ErbB3 protein levels, we sought to examine tumor development in ErbB2/Nrdp1 bigenic mice. We first created a vector to express human Nrdp1 cDNA in the mouse mammary gland using the MMTV-LTR promoter/enhancer (Fig. 1A) and demonstrated that this construct could drive Nrdp1 expression in cultured mammary epithelial cells (not shown). Three founder FvB strain transgenic mouse lines (called lines 12, 15, and 19) were then generated using a linearized MMTV-Nrdp1 plasmid. To estimate gene copy number and transcript levels, PCR primers that amplify an 82-bp region of human Nrdp1 exon 7 that is 100% identical to mouse were employed in real time PCR strategies. Real time PCR analysis of genomic DNA from nulliparous female mice revealed that founder lines 12, 15, and 19 contained ∼6, 2, and 14 copies of the Nrdp1 transgene, respectively, using the chromosome 14 T cell receptor delta gene as a reference. Real time analysis of genomic and mammary gland cDNA from several wild type and line 19-derived animals revealed that the transgenic mice contained on average 8-fold higher Nrdp1-containing genomic DNA than wild type animals, and ∼12-fold higher message levels (Fig. 1B). The lack of suitable antibodies precluded immunohistochemical analysis of ErbB3 and Nrdp1 in a mouse mammary gland. However, immunoblotting lysates of mammary glands taken from nulliparous adult wild type and MMTV-Nrdp1 female mice revealed that Nrdp1 protein levels were elevated severalfold in transgenic animals (Fig. 1C). This relatively modest elevation in Nrdp1 protein in transgenic versus wild type animals might suggest that normal mammary tissue establishes an upper limit to Nrdp1 protein expression that cannot be exceeded, even with significantly higher transcript levels. Although ErbB3 protein was close to the limit of detection by immunoblotting, it appeared that its levels were suppressed in the mammary glands of MMTV-Nrdp1 mice, consistent with the role of Nrdp1 in promoting ErbB3 degradation (16Yen L. Cao Z. Wu X. Ingalla E.R. Baron C. Young L.J. Gregg J.P. Cardiff R.D. Borowsky A.D. Sweeney C. Carraway 3rd, K.L. Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 11279-11286Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 28Diamonti A.J. Guy P.M. Ivanof C. Wong K. Sweeney C. Carraway 3rd, K.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

The impact of Nrdp1 overexpression on mammary gland development and morphology in transgenic mice appeared modest. Using whole mount analysis we observed that mammary gland development during puberty was delayed in some MMTV-Nrdp1 animals but eventually caught up to development observed in wild type mice (not shown). No deficiency in mammary development during pregnancy was noted, and MMTV-Nrdp1 dams were able to nurse their pups normally. Inspection of nulliparous MMTV-Nrdp1 transgenic female mice at very advanced ages of 52–74 weeks revealed a lobuloalveolar hyperplasic phenotype, sometimes coupled with a high degree of vacuolation and casein staining, in three of six animals examined. This phenotype was observed in only one of six wild type mice. However, the characteristics of the hyperplastic lesions were very similar to those described previously for elder FvB strain mice (33Wakefield L.M. Thordarson G. Nieto A.I. Shyamala G. Galvez J.J. Anver M.R. Cardiff R.D. Comp. Med. 2003; 53: 424-432PubMed Google Scholar), where hyperplastic growths in the mammary gland were suggested to be secondary to spontaneously arising prolactin-secreting lesions of the pituitary gland independent of transgene expression. To assess the effect of Nrdp1 restoration on ErbB2-driven mammary tumors, we crossed our MMTV-Nrdp1 line 19 mice with the NDL 2–5 line of ErbB2 transgenic mice (24Siegel P.M. Ryan E.D. Cardiff R.D. Muller W.J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2149-2164Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). We commonly refer to the resulting bigenic line as NxN. As expected, normal mammary tissue from NxN animals exhibited ∼12-fold elevated levels of Nrdp1 transcript relative to NDL mice (Fig. 2A), but normal tissue from both strains contained similar levels of ErbB3 transcript (Fig. 2B) as assessed by real time RT-PCR. These observations indicate that the Nrdp1 transgene is efficiently transcribed in bigenic mice. Surprisingly, we found that the latency of tumor formation in bigenic mice was statistically indistinguishable from the latency in NDL animals (Fig. 2C). None of the wild type or Nrdp1 transgenic mice employed in the study developed tumors over 35 weeks, whereas both NDL and NxN mice exhibited average tumor latencies of 21–23 weeks. A similar latency was observed when MMTV-Nrdp1 transgenic line 12 was crossed into the NDL tumor model (data not shown). Tumors derived from NDL and NxN strains were histologically similar (Fig. 3, A and B). The average numbers of tumors present throughout the mammary glands (Fig. 3C) as well as the overall tumor burden at the time of sacrifice (Fig. 3D) were also indistinguishable between the two groups. These observations indicate that reintroduction of the Nrdp1 transcript under an exogenous promoter has little discernable impact on ErbB2-induced tumor development. The observation that Nrdp1 overexpression in the mammary gland does not impact tumor formation and growth contrasts with in vitro results, where stable overexpression suppressed the proliferation and survival of cultured breast cancer cells (16Yen L. Cao Z. Wu X. Ingalla E.R. Baron C. Young L.J. Gregg J.P. Cardiff R.D. Borowsky A.D. Sweeney C. Carraway 3rd, K.L. Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 11279-11286Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). One possible explanation is that, in contrast to cultured cells, overexpressed Nrdp1 may not efficiently remove ErbB3 from the tumors of bigenic mice. To test this possibility, we immunoblotted normal and tumor tissue lysates from NDL and NxN mice with antibodies to ErbB3. Consistent with previous reports (16Yen L. Cao Z. Wu X. Ingalla E.R. Baron C. Young L.J. Gregg J.P. Cardiff R.D. Borowsky A.D. Sweeney C. Carraway 3rd, K.L. Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 11279-11286Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 24Siegel P.M. Ryan E.D. Cardiff R.D. Muller W.J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2149-2164Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar), we observed that ErbB3 protein levels are 10–100-fold higher in tumors from NDL mice than in normal tissue (Fig. 4A, top panel), from virtually undetectable signal in normal tissue to a very robust band in tumors. This difference in protein levels did not result from elevated ErbB3 transcript in tumors because real time RT-PCR analysis indicated a difference of less than 2-fold (Fig. 4B). Interestingly, very similar differences were observed in ErbB3 protein and message levels in normal and tumor tissue from NxN animals. These observations indicate that, in contrast with in vitro studies, overexpression of Nrdp1 cDNA in the mammary gland has little impact on ErbB3 protein levels in tumors. Thus, the inability of overexpressed Nrdp1 to suppress ErbB3 protein levels in mouse tumors may underlie its inability to impact tumor development. The discrepancy between the in vitro and in vivo results raises the question as to why transgenically overexpressed Nrdp1 does not function to suppress ErbB3 in tumors. One possibility is that despite the elevated transcript, transgene-derived Nrdp1 protein in tumors is nonfunctional. To address this possibility, we compared Nrdp1 protein and transcript expression levels in normal and tumor tissue derived from NDL and NxN mice. Consistent with the comparison of MMTV-Nrdp1 and wild type animals (Fig. 1C), Nrdp1 protein levels in normal mammary tissue were on average severalfold higher in NxN mice than in NDL mice (Fig. 4A, middle panel). More importantly, Nrdp1 protein was completely absent in tumors from both strains, even though Nrdp1 transcript levels were only suppressed by ∼35% during the transition from normal mammary tissue to tumor (Fig. 4C). These observations indicate that endogenous Nrdp1 protein is efficiently eliminated during the normal-to-tumor transition, raising the possibility that the suppression of Nrdp1 protein levels may be an important aspect of mammary ErbB2-mediated tumor initiation or growth. Critically, overexpression of Nrdp1 cDNA by better than 10-fold via an exogenous promoter cannot overcome Nrdp1 suppression by tumors because protein levels are potently suppressed via post-transcriptional mechanisms. To test the hypothesis that Nrdp1 protein is inherently more labile in tumor cells than in nontransformed cells, we developed an in vitro system for comparing the stability of exogenously expressed Nrdp1 in various cell lines. Immunoblotting of lysates from transiently transduced cells revealed that exogenous FLAG-tagged Nrdp1 protein expression is readily detected in non-transformed MCF10A breast epithelial cells, and its levels are only modestly increased (2–3-fold) upon treatment of cells with the proteasome inhibitor MG132 (Fig. 5A). However, Nrdp1 protein is not detected in ErbB2/3-positive BT474 breast tumor cells unless treated with MG132, where very robust expression is observed. Likewise, cells cultured from NDL tumors (25Miller J.K. Shattuck D.L. Ingalla E.Q. Yen L. Borowsky A.D. Young L.J. Cardiff R.D. Carraway 3rd, K.L. Sweeney C. Cancer Res. 2008; 68: 8286-8294Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) are resistant to Nrdp1 expression, suggesting that tumors arise from a population of cells that have lost the ability to maintain the Nrdp1 protein levels characteristic of normal tissue. MDA-MB-231 breast tumor cells supported a low level of Nrdp1 expression, which was markedly increased upon MG132 treatment (Fig. 5A). These observations indicate that breast tumor cell lines efficiently dispose of Nrdp1 via a proteasome-dependent mechanism. To examine the nature of Nrdp1 suppression by tumor cells, we compared Nrdp1 staining in MCF10A and MDA-MB-231 cells by immunofluorescence. In these experiments, the cells were transiently transduced with retrovirus encoding either nothing or FLAG-Nrdp1 immediately preceding an IRES-GFP cassette and examined for the presence of GFP, FLAG epitope, and nuclei. Comparison of GFP expression with DAPI nuclear staining revealed that transduction efficiency was essentially 100% for all conditions, verifying the presence of GFP- and Nrdp1-encoding message in all cells. However, only about half of the GFP-positive MCF10A cells exhibited detectable staining for FLAG-Nrdp1 protein (Fig. 5B), suggesting that post-transcriptional mechanisms suppressed Nrdp1 protein production in some cells. More importantly, less than 10% of the MDA-MB-231 cells were capable of supporting detectable FLAG-Nrdp1 protein, and Nrdp1 protein levels were significantly lower in these cells than in the MCF10As. These observations indicate that only a subpopulation of cells within a given culture is capable of supporting the efficient expression of Nrdp1 protein and that this subpopulation is far less prevalent in tumor cells than in nontransformed cells. To directly compare Nrdp1 lability in nontransformed and tumor cells, we compared its half-life when expressed in MCF10A and MDA-MB-231 cells by monitoring levels of exogenously expressed protein after treatment with cycloheximide (Fig. 5, C and D). We found that the half-life of FLAG-Nrdp1 is at least 6-fold longer in the nontransformed line than in the tumor line. Taken together, our observations strongly suggest that enhanced protein degradation contributes to the post-transcriptional loss of Nrdp1 protein observed during the breast normal-to-tumor transition. Although overexpression of ErbB2 protein in patient breast tumors very strongly correlates with gene amplification, the mechanisms by which ErbB3 protein is overexpressed have not been elucidated. Amplification of the erbB3 gene has been reported, but PCR and FISH results suggest that this is not as prevalent as erbB2 amplification (34Zaczek A. Welnicka-Jaśkiewicz M. Bielawski K.P.

Breast Cancer Res. 2008; 10: 8Crossref Scopus (127) Google Scholar) and does not account for the frequency of elevated ErbB3 protein observed in tumors (17Lemoine N.R. Barnes D.M. Hollywood D.P.

Tumors from transgenic mice overexpressing ErbB2 in the mammary gland exhibit elevated and tyrosine-phosphorylated endogenous ErbB3 (24Siegel P.M. Ryan E.D. Cardiff R.D. Muller W.J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2149-2164Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar), pointing to a selective advantage for the co-expression and activation of this receptor in ErbB2-overexpressing tumors. Interestingly, we (16Yen L. Cao Z. Wu X. Ingalla E.R. Baron C. Young L.J. Gregg J.P. Cardiff R.D. Borowsky A.D. Sweeney C. Carraway 3rd, K.L.

EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2149-2164Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar) have observed that despite a 10–100-fold elevation in ErbB3 protein levels during the normal-to-tumor transition, ErbB3 message levels remain virtually constant. These observations indicate that very potent post-transcriptional regulatory mechanisms suppress endogenous ErbB3 protein levels in normal mammary tissue. Such mechanisms may be important in tightly regulating receptor levels in cells, ensuring sufficient signaling for tissue development and maintenance but preventing oversignaling leading to aberrant development and neoplasia. Importantly, it appears that tumors inactivate these post-transcriptional mechanisms to augment receptor signaling and promote their growth and malignancy (27Fry W.H. Kotelawala L. Sweeney C. Carraway 3rd, K.L. Exp. Cell Res. 2009; 315: 697-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Because Nrdp1 regulates ErbB3 protein levels in cultured breast tumor cells by targeting receptors for degradation, we postulated that restoration of Nrdp1 to ErbB2-induced mouse mammary tumors would suppress tumor onset or progression by suppressing ErbB3 levels. Our hope was that the creation of the MMTV-Nrdp1 mouse would allow us to test this possibility. We initially found that Nrdp1 overexpression in the mammary gland suppresses ErbB3 protein levels in adult mice and elicits a minor delay in mammary gland development during puberty. It has previously been observed that ErbB3 deletion partially disrupts mammary gland morphogenesis (36Jackson-Fisher A.J. Bellinger G. Breindel J.L. Tavassoli F.A. Booth C.J. Duong J.K. Stern D.F. Breast Cancer Res. 2008; 10: R96Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), pointing to a role for this receptor in mammary development. Although the disruption of mammary development in MMTV-Nrdp1 mice was not nearly as striking, it is possible that Nrdp1 protein levels are post-transcriptionally suppressed during mammary gland development to permit ErbB3 function as they are in tumors. The necessity of Nrdp1 in mammary gland development and ErbB2-induced mammary tumor formation will be the focus of future studies. A hyperplastic phenotype observed in a subset of older wild type and transgenic mice was consistent with lesions associated with lactogenic hormone-producing pituitary tumors common to FvB strain animals independent of transgene (33Wakefield L.M. Thordarson G. Nieto A.I. Shyamala G. Galvez J.J. Anver M.R. Cardiff R.D. Comp. Med. 2003; 53: 424-432PubMed Google Scholar). Crossing MMTV-Nrdp1 mice into the ErbB2 overexpression model did not affect the latency or extent of mammary tumor formation nor the expression of ErbB3 protein. These results were initially surprising because there is a strong inverse relationship between Nrdp1 and ErbB3 protein levels when the analogous experiment is carried out with cultured cells (16Yen L. Cao Z. Wu X. Ingalla E.R. Baron C. Young L.J. Gregg J.P. Cardiff R.D. Borowsky A.D. Sweeney C. Carraway 3rd, K.L. Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 11279-11286Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 28Diamonti A.J. Guy P.M. Ivanof C. Wong K. Sweeney C. Carraway 3rd, K.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2002; 99: 2866-2871Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Comparison of Nrdp1 transcript and protein levels in normal and tumor tissue revealed that transcript was significantly elevated in bigenic mice, as expected, but protein was undetectable. These observations indicate that like ErbB3, Nrdp1 is post-transcriptionally regulated by tumors. These post-transcriptional regulatory mechanisms must be sufficiently powerful to rid tumors of Nrdp1 protein despite a 12-fold elevation in its message. Although other mechanisms such as translation and microRNA-mediated suppression may play a role in the post-transcriptional loss of Nrdp1, our observations point to a key role for protein degradation. We have previously observed that the Nrdp1 protein can be markedly unstable when transiently expressed in selected cell lines, and mutation of the RING finger domain significantly elevates its stability (37Wu X. Yen L. Irwin L. Sweeney C. Carraway 3rd, K.L. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 24: 7748-7757Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that Nrdp1 autoubiquitination can promote is own degradation, in turn raising the possibility that tumor cells inactivate mechanisms that thwart the efficiency of Nrdp1 degradation. The resulting loss of Nrdp1 allows ErbB3 accumulation, which then contributes to tumor initiation and progression. In support of this hypothesis, we observed that Nrdp1 protein is more stable in nontransformed MCF10A breast epithelial cells than in several breast cancer cell lines and that proteasome-dependent pathways mediate the efficient degradation of Nrdp1 in tumor cells. Immunofluorescence studies revealed that differences in Nrdp1 expression between cell lines were related to both the percentage of cells capable of supporting Nrdp1 expression and the amount of Nrdp1 protein produced in each cell. Our previous ability to stably express Nrdp1 in breast tumor cells (16Yen L. Cao Z. Wu X. Ingalla E.R. Baron C. Young L.J. Gregg J.P. Cardiff R.D. Borowsky A.D. Sweeney C. Carraway 3rd, K.L. Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 11279-11286Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) was likely due to the clonal selection of expressing subpopulations. It should be noted that Nrdp1 is likely not the only protein dysregulated in either mouse or patient mammary tumors to augment ErbB2/ErbB3 signaling (25Miller J.K. Shattuck D.L. Ingalla E.Q. Yen L. Borowsky A.D. Young L.J. Cardiff R.D. Carraway 3rd, K.L. Sweeney C. Cancer Res. 2008; 68: 8286-8294Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 27Fry W.H. Kotelawala L. Sweeney C. Carraway 3rd, K.L.

Neoplasia. 2006; 11: 89-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Numerous proteins have been described that contribute to the degradation of ErbB receptors by either mediating their trafficking to lysosomes or suppressing the signaling activity of receptors. The loss or suppression of many of these has been reported in various tumors. For example, we have observed that like Nrdp1, the ErbB negative regulatory protein LRIG1 is also suppressed during the mammary normal-to-tumor transition in NDL mice (25Miller J.K. Shattuck D.L. Ingalla E.Q. Yen L. Borowsky A.D. Young L.J. Cardiff R.D. Carraway 3rd, K.L. Sweeney C. Cancer Res. 2008; 68: 8286-8294Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Thus, it is possible that tumors effectively suppress or inactivate combinations of genes encoding ErbB negative regulators to elevate ErbB receptor levels and/or augment receptor signaling activity. Future studies will be aimed at characterizing combinatorial contributions of ErbB negative regulatory mechanisms that are suppressed by mammary tumors. More broadly, our observations underscore the importance of post-transcriptional mechanisms in regulating key events in breast tumor progression. Both ErbB3 and Nrdp1 are dysregulated post-transcriptionally in tumors, and it is known that other oncogenic and tumor suppressor proteins are similarly targeted by tumor cells at the level of protein synthesis or stability. Because such events are overlooked by gene expression screens, strategies for accurately comparing the levels of a given oncogenic or anti-oncogenic protein in normal and tumor tissue are essential to provide a complete picture of oncogenic signaling."

Recently, the activity of the mammalian Polo kinase ortholog Plk1 has been implicated in the formation of this complex. We show here that Polo kinase interacts directly with the cytokinesis initiation complex by binding RacGAP50C. We find that a new domain of Polo kinase, termed the intermediate domain, interacts directly with RacGAP50C and that Polo kinase is essential for localization of the KLP-RacGAP centralspindlin complex to the cell equator and spindle midzone. In the absence of Polo kinase, RacGAP50C and Pav-KLP fail to localize normally, instead decorating microtubules along their length. Our results indicate that Polo kinase directly binds the conserved cytokinesis initiation complex and is required to trigger centralspindlin localization as a first step in cytokinesis."

In previous work, we demonstrated that heterozygous expression of the pol δ L604G variant in mice results in normal life span and no apparent phenotype, whereas a different substitution at the same position, L604K, is associated with shortened life span and accelerated carcinogenesis. Here, we report in vitro analysis of the homologous mutations at position Leu-606 in human pol δ. Four-subunit human pol δ variants that harbor or lack 3' → 5'-exonucleolytic proofreading activity were purified from Escherichia coli. The pol δ L606G and L606K holoenzymes retain catalytic activity and processivity similar to that of wild type pol δ. pol δ L606G is highly error prone, incorporating single noncomplementary nucleotides at a high frequency during DNA synthesis, whereas pol δ L606K is extremely accurate, with a higher fidelity of single nucleotide incorporation by the active site than that of wild type pol δ. However, pol δ L606K is impaired in the bypass of DNA adducts, and the homologous variant in mouse embryonic fibroblasts results in a decreased rate of replication fork progression in vivo. These results indicate that different substitutions at a single active site residue in a eukaryotic polymerase can either increase or decrease the accuracy of synthesis relative to wild type and suggest that enhanced fidelity of base selection by a polymerase active site can result in impaired lesion bypass and delayed replication fork progression."

https://openalex.org/W1964532683,"Several unique biological features of HIV-1 Vpr make it a potentially powerful agent for anti-cancer therapy. First, Vpr inhibits cell proliferation by induction of cell cycle G2 arrest. Second, it induces apoptosis through multiple mechanisms, which could be significant as it may be able to overcome apoptotic resistance exhibited by many cancerous cells, and, finally, Vpr selectively kills fast growing cells in a p53-independent manner. To demonstrate the potential utility of Vpr as an anti-cancer agent, we carried out proof-of-concept studies in vitro and in vivo. Results of our preliminary studies demonstrated that Vpr induces cell cycle G2 arrest and apoptosis in a variety of cancer types. Moreover, the same Vpr effects could also be detected in some cancer cells that are resistant to anti-cancer drugs such as doxorubicin (DOX). To further illustrate the potential value of Vpr in tumor growth inhibition, we adopted a DOX-resistant neuroblastoma model by injecting SK-N-SH cells into C57BL/6N and C57BL/6J-scid/scid mice. We hypothesized that Vpr is able to block cell proliferation and induce apoptosis regardless of the drug resistance status of the tumors. Indeed, production of Vpr via adenoviral delivery to neuroblastoma cells caused G2 arrest and apoptosis in both drug naïve and DOX-resistant cells. In addition, pre-infection or intratumoral injection of vpr-expressing adenoviral particles into neuroblastoma tumors in SCID mice markedly inhibited tumor growth. Therefore, Vpr could possibly be used as a supplemental viral therapeutic agent for selective inhibition of tumor growth in anti-cancer therapy especially when other therapies stop working."

We examined diaphragmatic function and fiber composition and identified the role of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPAR α and β/δ) as a factor involved in diaphragm muscle plasticity in response to type I diabetes. Methodology/Principal Findings Streptozotocin-treated rats were studied after 8 weeks and compared with their controls. Diaphragmatic strips were stimulated in vitro and mechanical and energetic variables were measured, cross bridge kinetics assessed, and the effects of fatigue and hypoxia evaluated. Morphometry, myosin heavy chain isoforms, PPAR α and β/δ gene and protein expression were also assessed. Diabetes induced a decrease in maximum velocity of shortening (−14%, P<0.05) associated with a decrease in myosin ATPase activity (−49%, P<0.05), and an increase in force (+20%, P<0.05) associated with an increase in the number of cross bridges (+14%, P<0.05). These modifications were in agreement with a shift towards slow myosin heavy chain fibers and were associated with an upregulation of PPARβ/δ (+314% increase in gene and +190% increase in protein expression, P<0.05). In addition, greater resistances to fatigue and hypoxia were observed in diabetic rats. Conclusions/Significance Type I diabetes induced complex mechanical and energetic changes in the rat diaphragm and was associated with an up-regulation of PPARβ/δ that could improve resistance to fatigue and hypoxia and favour the shift towards slow myosin heavy chain isoforms."
https://openalex.org/W2014977721,"Assessing the contribution of promoters and coding sequences to gene evolution is an important step toward discovering the major genetic determinants of human evolution. Many specific examples have revealed the evolutionary importance of cis-regulatory regions. However, the relative contribution of regulatory and coding regions to the evolutionary process and whether systemic factors differentially influence their evolution remains unclear. To address these questions, we carried out an analysis at the genome scale to identify signatures of positive selection in human proximal promoters. Next, we examined whether genes with positively selected promoters (Prom+ genes) show systemic differences with respect to a set of genes with positively selected protein-coding regions (Cod+ genes). We found that the number of genes in each set was not significantly different (8.1% and 8.5%, respectively). Furthermore, a functional analysis showed that, in both cases, positive selection affects almost all biological processes and only a few genes of each group are located in enriched categories, indicating that promoters and coding regions are not evolutionarily specialized with respect to gene function. On the other hand, we show that the topology of the human protein network has a different influence on the molecular evolution of proximal promoters and coding regions. Notably, Prom+ genes have an unexpectedly high centrality when compared with a reference distribution (P=0.008, for Eigenvalue centrality). Moreover, the frequency of Prom+ genes increases from the periphery to the center of the protein network (P=0.02, for the logistic regression coefficient). This means that gene centrality does not constrain the evolution of proximal promoters, unlike the case with coding regions, and further indicates that the evolution of proximal promoters is more efficient in the center of the protein network than in the periphery. These results show that proximal promoters have had a systemic contribution to human evolution by increasing the participation of central genes in the evolutionary process."
https://openalex.org/W2063730166,"Background Uncertainty and predictability have remained at the center of the study of human attention. Yet, studies have only examined whether response times (RT) or fixations were longer or shorter under levels of stimulus uncertainty. To date, no study has examined patterns of stimuli and responses through a unifying framework of uncertainty. Methodology/Principal Findings We asked 29 college students to generate repeated responses to a continuous series of visual stimuli presented on a computer monitor. Subjects produced these responses by pressing on a keypad as soon a target was detected (regardless of position) while the durations of their visual fixations were recorded. We manipulated the level of stimulus uncertainty in space and time by changing the number of potential stimulus locations and time intervals between stimulus presentations. To allow the analyses to be conducted using uncertainty as common description of stimulus and response we calculated the entropy of the RT and fixation durations. We tested the hypothesis of uncertainty compensation across space and time by fitting the RT and fixation duration entropy values to a quadratic surface. The quadratic surface accounted for 80% of the variance in the entropy values of both RT and fixation durations. RT entropy increased as a function of spatial and temporal uncertainty of the stimulus, alongside a symmetric, compensatory decrease in the entropy of fixation durations as the level of spatial and temporal uncertainty of the stimuli was increased. Conclusions/Significance Our results demonstrate that greater uncertainty in the stimulus leads to greater uncertainty in the response, and that the effects of spatial and temporal uncertainties are compensatory. We also observed compensatory relationship across the entropies of fixation duration and RT, suggesting that a more predictable visual search strategy leads to more uncertain response patterns and vice versa."

Structural data suggest that differences in the residues of the 39-loop (residues 31-41) may partly be responsible for the differential reactivity of the two proteases with AT. This loop is highly acidic in FXa, containing three Glu residues at positions 36, 37, and 39. By contrast, the loop is shorter by one residue in FIXa (residue 37 is missing), and it contains a Lys and an Asp at positions 36 and 39, respectively. To determine whether differences in the residues of this loop contribute to the slower reactivity of FIXa with AT, we prepared an FIXa/FXa chimera in which the 39-loop of the protease was replaced with the corresponding loop of FXa. The chimeric mutant cleaved a FIXa-specific chromogenic substrate with normal catalytic efficiency, however, the mutant exhibited approximately 5-fold enhanced reactivity with AT specifically in the absence of the cofactor, heparin. Further studies revealed that the FIXa mutant activates factor X with approximately 4-fold decreased k(cat) and approximately 2-fold decreased K(m), although the mutant interacted normally with factor VIIIa. Based on these results we conclude that residues of the 39-loop regulate the cofactor-independent interaction of FIXa with its physiological inhibitor AT and substrate factor X."
https://openalex.org/W2019744056,"Rhodopsin is the rod photoreceptor G protein-coupled receptor responsible for capturing light. Mutations in the gene encoding this protein can lead to a blinding disease called retinitis pigmentosa, which is inherited frequently in an autosomal dominant manner. The E150K opsin mutant associated with rarely occurring autosomal recessive retinitis pigmentosa localizes to <i>trans</i>-Golgi network membranes rather than to plasma membranes of rod photoreceptor cells. We investigated the molecular mechanisms underlying opsin retention in the Golgi apparatus. Electrostatic calculations reveal that the E150K mutant features an overall accumulation of positive charges between helices H-IV and H-II. Human E150K and several other closely related opsin mutants were then expressed in HEK-293 cells. Spectral characteristics and functional biochemistry of each mutant were analyzed after reconstitution with the <i>cis</i>-retinoid chromophore. UV-visible spectra and rhodopsin/transducin activation assays revealed only minor differences between the purified wild type control and rhodopsin mutants. However, partial restoration of the surface electrostatic charge in the compensatory R69E/E150K double mutant rescues the plasma membrane localization of opsin. These findings emphasize the fundamental importance of electrostatic interactions for appropriate membrane trafficking of opsin and advance our understanding of the pathophysiology of autosomal recessive retinitis pigmentosa due to the E150K mutation."
https://openalex.org/W2020952817,"DNA repair takes place in the context of chromatin. Previous studies showed that histones impair base excision repair (BER) of modified bases at both the excision and synthesis steps. We examined BER of uracil in a glucocorticoid response element (GRE) complexed with the glucocorticoid receptor DNA binding domain (GR-DBD). Five substrates were designed, each containing a unique C-->U substitution within the mouse mammary tumor virus promoter, one located within each GRE half-site and the others located outside the GRE. To examine distinct steps of BER, DNA cleavage by uracil-DNA glycosylase and Ape1 endonuclease was used to assess initiation, dCTP incorporation by DNA polymerase (pol) beta was used to measure repair synthesis, and DNA ligase I was used to seal the nick. For uracil sites within the GRE, there was a reduced rate of uracil-DNA glycosylase/Ape1 activity following GR-DBD binding. Cleavage in the right half-site, with higher GR-DBD binding affinity, was reduced approximately 5-fold, whereas cleavage in the left half-site was reduced approximately 3.8-fold. Conversely, uracil-directed cleavage outside the GRE was unaffected by GR-DBD binding. Surprisingly, there was no reduction in the rate of pol beta synthesis or DNA ligase activity on any of the fragments bound to GR-DBD. Indeed, we observed a small increase ( approximately 1.5-2.2-fold) in the rate of pol beta synthesis at uracil residues in both the GRE and one site six nucleotides downstream. These results highlight the potential for both positive and negative impacts of DNA-transcription factor binding on the rate of BER."
https://openalex.org/W1968702726,"We introduce the notion of a network's conduciveness, a probabilistically interpretable measure of how the network's structure allows it to be conducive to roaming agents, in certain conditions, from one portion of the network to another. We exemplify its use through an application to the two problems in combinatorial optimization that, given an undirected graph, ask that its so-called chromatic and independence numbers be found. Though NP-hard, when solved on sequences of expanding random graphs there appear marked transitions at which optimal solutions can be obtained substantially more easily than right before them. We demonstrate that these phenomena can be understood by resorting to the network that represents the solution space of the problems for each graph and examining its conduciveness between the non-optimal solutions and the optimal ones. At the said transitions, this network becomes strikingly more conducive in the direction of the optimal solutions than it was just before them, while at the same time becoming less conducive in the opposite direction. We believe that, besides becoming useful also in other areas in which network theory has a role to play, network conduciveness may become instrumental in helping clarify further issues related to NP-hardness that remain poorly understood."
