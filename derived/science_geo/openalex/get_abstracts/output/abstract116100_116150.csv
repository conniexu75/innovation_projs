https://openalex.org/W2025846514,"The ob gene product, leptin, is an important circulating signal for the regulation of body weight. To identify high affinity leptin-binding sites, we generated a series of leptin-alkaline phosphatase (AP) fusion proteins as well as [125I]leptin. After a binding survey of cell lines and tissues, we identified leptin-binding sites in the mouse choroid plexus. A cDNA expression library was prepared from mouse choroid plexus and screened with a leptin-AP fusion protein to identify a leptin receptor (OB-R). OB-R is a single membrane-spanning receptor most related to the gp130 signal-transducing component of the IL-6 receptor, the G-CSF receptor, and the LIF receptor. OB-R mRNA is expressed not only in choroid plexus, but also in several other tissues, including hypothalamus. Genetic mapping of the gene encoding OB-R shows that it is within the 5.1 cM interval of mouse chromosome 4 that contains the db locus."
https://openalex.org/W2002154440,"The 75 kDa tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR2) transduces extracellular signals via receptor-associated cytoplasmic proteins. Two of these signal transducers, TRAF1 and TRAF2, were isolated and characterized previously. We report here the biochemical purification and subsequent molecular cloning of two novel TNFR2-associated proteins, designated c-IAP1 and c-IAP2, that are closely related mammalian members of the inhibitor of apoptosis protein (IAP) family originally identified in baculoviruses. The viral and cellular IAPs contain N-terminal baculovirus IAP repeat (BIR) motifs and a C-terminal RING finger. The c-IAPs do not directly contact TNFR2, but rather associate with TRAF1 and TRAF2 through their N-terminal BIR motif-comprising domain. The recruitment of c-IAP1 or c-IAP2 to the TNFR2 signaling complex requires a TRAF2-TRAF1 heterocomplex."
https://openalex.org/W1988678729,"We have isolated a human homolog of Xenopus Eg5, a kinesin-related motor protein implicated in the assembly and dynamics of the mitotic spindle. We report that microinjection of antibodies against human Eg5 (HsEg5) blocks centrosome migration and causes HeLa cells to arrest in mitosis with monoastral microtubule arrays. Furthermore, an evolutionarily conserved cdc2 phosphorylation site (Thr-927) in HsEg5 is phosphorylated specifically during mitosis in HeLa cells and by p34cdc2/cyclin B in vitro. Mutation of Thr-927 to nonphosphorylatable residues prevents HsEg5 from binding to centrosomes, indicating that phosphorylation controls the association of this motor with the spindle apparatus. These results indicate that HsEg5 is required for establishing a bipolar spindle and that p34cdc2 protein kinase directly regulates its localization."
https://openalex.org/W2056618449,"Ions are not traditionally thought to act as first messengers in signal transduction cascades. However, while searching for genes regulated by the PhoP/PhoQ virulence regulatory system of Salmonella typhimurium, we recovered two loci whose expression is controlled by the concentration of Mg2+. To determine whether Mg2+ is the signal modulating the whole PhoP/PhoQ system, we evaluated the gene expression pattern of six PhoP-activated genes. Growth in physiological concentrations of divalent cations repressed transcription of PhoP-activated genes and rendered wild-type Salmonella phenotypically PhoP-. Mg2+ changed the conformation of the periplasmic domain of PhoQ, identifying this protein as a Mg2+ sensor. A mutation in the sensing domain of PhoQ altered the set point for Mg2+ and rendered Salmonella avirulent."
https://openalex.org/W2072692243,"Apoptotic cell death is a mechanism by which organisms eliminate superfluous or harmful cells. Expression of the cell death regulatory protein REAPER (RPR) in the developing Drosophila eye results in a small eye owing to excess cell death. We show that mutations in thread (th) are dominant enhancers of RPR-induced cell death and that th encodes a protein homologous to baculovirus inhibitors of apoptosis (IAPs), which we call Drosophila IAP1 (DIAP1). Overexpression of DIAP1 or a related protein, DIAP2, in the eye suppresses normally occurring cell death as well as death due to overexpression of rpr or head involution defective. IAP death-preventing activity localizes to the N-terminal baculovirus IAP repeats, a motif found in both viral and cellular proteins associated with death prevention."
https://openalex.org/W1971764800,"Mice unable to synthesize dopamine (DA) specifically in dopaminergic neurons were created by inactivating the tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) gene then by restoring TH function in noradrenergic cells. These DA-deficient (DA-/-) mice were born at expected frequency but became hypoactive and stopped feeding a few weeks after birth. Midbrain dopaminergic neurons, their projections, and most characteristics of their target neurons in the striatum appeared normal. Within a few minutes of being injected with L-dihdroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA), the product of TH, the DA-/- mice became more active and consumed more food than control mice. With continued administration of L-DOPA, nearly normal growth was achieved. These studies indicate that DA is essential for movement and feeding, but is not required for the development of neural circuits that control these behaviors."
https://openalex.org/W2147791888,"We have determined the 2.0 Å crystal structure of a fragment of human fibronectin encompassing the seventh through the RGD-containing tenth type III repeats (FN7–10). The structure reveals an extended rod-like molecule with a long axis of ∼140 Å and highly variable relationships between adjacent domains. An unusually small rotation between domains 9 and 10 creates a distinctive binding site, in which the RGD loop from domain 10 and the “synergy” region from domain 9 are on the same face of FN7–10 and thus easily accessible to a single integrin molecule. The cell-binding RGD loop is well-ordered in this structure and extends ∼10 Å away from the FN7–10 core."
https://openalex.org/W2073908723,"We provide evidence that FGF8 serves as an endogenous inducer of chick limb formation and that its expression in the intermediate mesoderm at the appropriate time and place to trigger forelimb development is directly linked to the mechanism of embryonic kidney differentiation. One function of the limb inducer is to initiate Fgf8 gene expression in the ectoderm overlying the prospective limb-forming territories. FGF8 secreted by the ectoderm then appears to initiate limb bud formation by promoting outgrowth of and Sonic hedgehog expression in the underlying lateral plate mesoderm. FGF8 also maintains mesoderm outgrowth and Sonic hedgehog expression in the established limb bud. Our data thus point to FGF8 as a key regulator of limb development that not only induces and initiates the formation of a limb bud, but also sustains its subsequent development."
https://openalex.org/W2110458673,"The frequencies of certain periodic behaviors of the nematode C. elegans are regulated in a dose-dependent manner by the activity of the gene egl-10. These behaviors are modulated oppositely by the activity of the G protein alpha subunit gene goa-1, suggesting that egl-10 may regulate a G protein signaling pathway in a dose-dependent fashion. egl-10 encodes a protein similar to Sst2p, a negative regulator of G protein signaling in yeast. EGL-10 protein is localized in neural processes, where it may function in neurotransmitter signaling. Two previously known and 13 newly identified mammalian genes have similarity to egl-10 and SST2, and we propose that members of this family regulate many G protein signaling pathways."
https://openalex.org/W2126955433,"We isolated a cDNA clone encoding a kinesin-related protein, which we named XKCM1. Antibodies to XKCM1 stain mitotic centromeres and spindle poles. Immunodepletion and antibody addition experiments in an in vitro spindle assembly assay show that XKCM1 is required for both establishment and maintenance of mitotic spindles. The structures that form in the absence of XKCM1 contain abnormally long microtubules. This long microtubule defect can be rescued by the addition of purified XKCM1 protein. Analysis of microtubule dynamics in a clarified mitotic extract reveals that loss of XKCM1 function causes a 4-fold suppression in the catastrophe frequency. XKCM1 thus exhibits a novel activity for a kinesin-related protein by promoting microtubule depolymerization during mitotic spindle assembly."
https://openalex.org/W2144216849,"The embryo of the flowering plant Arabidopsis develops by a regular pattern of cell divisions and cell shape changes. Mutations in the KNOLLE (KN) gene affect the rate and plane of cell divisions as well as cell morphology, resulting in mutant seedlings with a disturbed radial organization of tissue layers. At the cellular level, mutant embryos are characterized by incomplete cross walls and enlarged cells with polyploid nuclei. The KN gene was isolated by positional cloning. The predicted KN protein has similarity to syntaxins, a protein family involved in vesicular trafficking. During embryogenesis, KN transcripts are detected in patches of single cells or small cell groups. Our results suggest a function for KN in cytokinesis."
https://openalex.org/W2034266027,"Dividing cells must coordinate cell cycle events to ensure genetic stability. Here we identify an essential two-component signal transduction protein that controls multiple events in the Caulobacter cell cycle, including cell division, stalk synthesis, and cell cycle–specific transcription. This protein, CtrA, is homologous to response regulator transcription factors and controls transcription from a group of cell cycle–regulated promoters critical for DNA replication, DNA methylation, and flagellar biogenesis. CtrA activity in the cell cycle is controlled both transcriptionally and by phosphorylation. As purified CtrA binds an essential DNA sequence motif found within its target promoters, we propose that CtrA acts in a phosphorelay signal transduction system to control bacterial cell cycle events directly at the transcriptional level."
https://openalex.org/W1998225655,"The C-terminal “cell-binding domain” (CBD) of thrombospondin-1 (TS1) is a binding site for many cell types. Cell-binding peptides based on the sequence RFYVVM from the CBD of TS1 affinity label a 52-kDa cell surface glycoprotein, which we show is integrin-associated protein (IAP or CD47). IAP associates with αvβ3 and thereby modulates the activity of several integrins. Cells that express IAP bind strongly to TS1, the CBD, and its active cell-binding peptides while IAP negative cells do not. The 52-kDa protein is affinity labeled on IAP-positive but not IAP-negative cells, and monoclonal antibodies against IAP specifically immunoprecipitate the affinity-labeled 52-kDa protein from lysates of IAP-positive cells. Consistent with the association of IAP with αvβ3 integrin, the labeled 52-kDa protein is immunoprecipitated by an anti-αvβ3 antibody. Endothelial cells exhibit chemotaxis toward TS1 (at concentrations above 10 nM) and RFYVVM peptides. Chemotaxis to both agents is specifically inhibited by a function blocking anti-IAP monoclonal antibody. These data establish IAP (CD47) as a receptor for the CBD of TS1 and suggest a mechanism for the well established effects of the CBD on cell motility.

https://openalex.org/W2060966417,"PKC gamma is highly expressed in Purkinje cells (PCs) but not in other types of neurons in the cerebellum. The expression of PKC gamma changes markedly during cerebellar development, being very low at birth and reaching a peak around the third postnatal week. This temporal pattern of PKC gamma expression coincides with the developmental transition from multiple to single climbing fiber innervation onto each PC. In adult mutant mice deficient in PKC gamma, we found that 41% of PCs are still innervated by multiple climbing fibers, while other aspects of the cerebellum including the morphology and excitatory synaptic transmission of PCs appear normal. Thus, elimination of multiple climbing fiber innervation appears to be specifically impaired in the mutant cerebellum. We suggest that the developmental role of PKC gamma may be to act as a downstream element in the signal cascade necessary for the elimination of surplus climbing fiber synapses."
https://openalex.org/W1979996083,"It is generally believed that a smooth execution of a compound movement, or motor coordination, requires learning of component movements as well as experience-based refinement of the motor program as a whole. PKC gamma mutant mice display impaired motor coordination but intact eyeblink conditioning, a form of component movement learning. Cerebellar long-term depression, a putative cellular mechanism for component motor learning, is also unimpaired. Thus, PKC gamma mutant mice are defective in refinement of the motor program. In the accompanying paper, we demonstrate that innervation of multiple climbing fibers onto Purkinje cells persists in adulthood in these mutant mice. We propose that this defective elimination of surplus climbing fibers underlies motor discoordination."
https://openalex.org/W2031203111,"Commitment of mammalian cells to enter S phase enables the transcription factor E2F-1 to activate certain genes whose products mediate cell cycle advance. In S phase, E2F-1 forms stable complexes with cyclin A-kinase, which in turn eliminates E2F-1DNA binding function. Here, we show that suppression of E2F-1 DNA-binding activity by cyclin A-kinase is linked to orderly S phase progression. Disruption of this linkage resulted in S phase delay/arrest followed by regrowth or apoptosis, depending upon whether the DNA-bound E2F-1 could transactivate. Hence, the unscheduled presence of E2F-1 on specific DNA sequences during S phase can activate a specific S phase checkpoint, thereby linking transcription, DNA replication, and cell cycle control."
https://openalex.org/W2126106174,"The SecA subunit of E. coli preprotein translocase promotes protein secretion during cycles of membrane insertion and deinsertion at SecYEG. This process is regulated both by nucleotide binding and hydrolysis and by the SecD and SecF proteins. In the presence of associated preprotein, the energy of ATP binding at nucleotide-binding domain 1 (NBD1) drives membrane insertion of a 30 kDa domain of SecA, while deinsertion of SecA requires the hydrolysis of this ATP. SecD and SecF stabilize the inserted state of SecA. ATP binding at NBD2, though needed for preprotein translocation, is not needed for SecA insertion or deinsertion."
https://openalex.org/W2013080121,"The cytosolic yeast proteins Sec13p-Sec31p, Sec23p-Sec24p, and the small GTP-binding protein Sart p generate protein transport vesicles by forming the membrane coat termed COPII We demonstrate by thin section and immunoelectron microscopy that purified COPII components form transport vesicles directly from the outer membrane of isolated yeast nuclei. Another set of yeast cytosolic proteins, coatomer and Arf1p (COPI), also form coated buds and vesicles from the nuclear envelope. Formation of COPI-coated, but not COPII-coated, buds and vesicles on the nuclear envelope is inhibited by the fungal metabolite brefeldin A. The two vesicle populations are distinct. However, both vesicle types are devoid of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) resident proteins, and each contains targeting proteins necessary for docking at the Golgi complex. Our data suggest that COPI and COPII mediate separate vesicular transport pathways from the ER."
https://openalex.org/W2094988830,"Using a genetic approach, we assessed the effects of mutations in protein kinase A (PKA) on long-term potentiation (LTP) in the mossy fiber pathway and its relationship to spatial and contextual learning. Ablation by gene targeting of the C beta 1 or the RI beta isoform of PKA produces a selective defect in mossy fiber LTP, providing genetic evidence for the role of these isoforms in the mossy fiber pathway. Despite the elimination of mossy fiber LTP, the behavioral responses to novelty, spatial learning, and conditioning to context are unaffected. Thus, contrary to current theories about hippocampal function, mossy fiber LTP does not appear to be required for spatial or contextual learning. In the absence of mossy fiber LTP, adequate spatial and contextual information might reach the CA1 region via other pathways from the entorhinal cortex."
https://openalex.org/W1965895804,"In higher eukaryotes, Cdk2 kinase plays an essential role in regulating the G1–S transition. Here, we use cycling Xenopus egg extracts to examine the requirement of Cdk2 kinase on progression into mitosis. Interestingly, when Cdk2 kinase activity is inhibited by the Cdk-specific inhibitor, p21Cip1, a block to mitosis occurs, and inactive Cdc2–cyclin B accumulates. This block occurs in the absence of nuclei and is not due to direct inhibition of Cdc2 by Cip. Importantly, this block to mitosis is reversible by restoring Cdk2–cyclin E kinase activity to a Cip-treated cycling extract. Moreover, immunodepletion of Cdk2 from interphase extracts prevents activation of Cdc2 upon the addition of exogenous cyclin B. Thus, our data show that Cdk2 kinase is a positive regulator of Cdc2–cyclin B complexes and establish a link between Cdk2 kinase and cell cycle progression into mitosis."
https://openalex.org/W2086871899,"Processing of DNA damage by the DNA double-strand break repair pathway in mammalian cells is accomplished by multiprotein complexes. However, the nature of these complexes and details of the molecular interactions are not fully understood. Interaction of the yeast RAD51 and RAD52 proteins plays a crucial role in yeast DNA homologous recombination and DNA double-strand break repair. Here, specific interactions between human RAD51 and RAD52 proteins are demonstrated both in vivo, using the yeast two-hybrid system and immunoprecipitation of insect cells co-infected with RAD51 and RAD52 recombinant viruses, and in vitro, using affinity chromatography with purified recombinant proteins. These results suggest that RAD52 may modulate the catalytic activities of RAD51 protein such as homologous pairing and strand exchange through a direct physical interaction. In addition, the domain in RAD52 that mediates this interaction was determined in vitro and in vivo. The RAD51-interacting region (amino acids 291-330) of the human RAD52 protein shows no homology with the yeast RAD52 protein, indicating that the interaction between RAD51 and RAD52 is species-specific.

The genome of living organisms is constantly damaged by exposure to exogenous and endogenous agents. The inherent stability of the DNA molecule provides the first level of protection from such damage. Moreover, organisms have developed intricate machineries of DNA repair to fix various types of damage. During the last 2 decades, investigators have identified and characterized different DNA repair pathways using various approaches such as yeast genetic studies. Three epistasis groups have been identified in Saccharomyces cerevisiae that control nucleotide excision repair (RAD3 epistasis group), error prone/post-replication repair (RAD6 epistasis group), and recombinational repair (RAD52 epistasis group). Both genetic and molecular studies on the yeast RAD52 epistasis group have clearly indicated close links between the mechanism of homologous recombination and DNA double-strand break (DSB) 1The abbreviations used are: DSBDNA double strand breakGal4-DAGal4 DNA activation domain (amino acids 768-881 of Gal4 protein)Gal4-DBGal4 DNA binding domain (amino acids 1-147 of Gal4 protein)lacZβ-galactosidase geneBSAbovine serum albuminPCRpolymerase chain reaction. repair. Mutants belonging to this group exhibit elevated sensitivity to ionizing radiation and methyl methanesulfonate. In addition, this group of mutants is defective in both meiotic and mitotic recombination processes (1.Haynes R.H. Kunz B.A. Strathern J.N. Jones E.W. Broach J.M.

Podust V. Hubscher U. Berg P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15070-15079Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Genetic and physical evidence for the interaction of yeast RAD52 and RAD51 suggests that at least a subset of the RAD52 epistasis group proteins interact with each other(10.Shinohara A. Ogawa H. Ogawa T. Cell. 1992; 69: 457-470Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1041) Google Scholar, 11.Milne G.T. Weaver D.T.

Additional evidence for a multiprotein repair complex comes from the dominant negative phenotypes exhibited by mutant alleles of RAD52. Some rad52 dominant-negative alleles act via nonproductive interaction with RAD51, whereas others can act independently of RAD51, perhaps associating with other repair proteins. Therefore, RAD52 epistasis group-mediated DSB repair appears to require multiprotein complexes for damage processing. The null mutant of RAD51 is partially defective in the formation of physical recombinants and accumulates double-strand breaks at a meiotic recombination hot spot(10.Shinohara A. Ogawa H. Ogawa T.

Some studies have suggested that the RAD52 protein is not required for the initiation of recombination, but is essential for the intermediate stage following the formation of DSBs but before the appearance of stable recombinants(10.Shinohara A. Ogawa H. Ogawa T. Cell. 1992; 69: 457-470Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1041) Google Scholar). Most recently, human RAD52 protein has been shown to confer resistance to ionizing radiation and induce homologous recombination in monkey cells(29.Park M.S. J. Biol.

Although interaction between yeast RAD52 and RAD51 proteins has been observed both in vitro(10.Shinohara A. Ogawa H. Ogawa T.

First, while the human RAD51 protein is highly homologous to the yeast RAD51 protein (83%) throughout the whole polypeptide, the human and yeast RAD52 proteins show significant homology only in the amino-terminal one-third. The carboxyl-terminal two-thirds of human RAD52 has little or no homology with the yeast RAD52 protein(20.Shinohara A. Ogawa H. Matsuda Y. Ushio N. Ikeo K. Ogawa T.

Genes & Dev. 1993; 7: 1755-1765Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 12.Donovan J.W. Milne G.T. Weaver D.T. Genes & Dev. 1994; 8: 2552-2562Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). This raises the question of whether human RAD52 and RAD51 interact at all. Second, neither human RAD51 cDNA (20.Shinohara A. Ogawa H. Matsuda Y. Ushio N. Ikeo K. Ogawa T. Nature Genet. 1993; 4: 239-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) nor yeast Kluyveromyces lactis RAD51 complements the Rad51 defect of yeast S. cerevisiae(12.Donovan J.W. Milne G.T. Weaver D.T. Genes & Dev. 1994; 8: 2552-2562Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). This suggests that the interaction between RAD51 and RAD52 via the carboxyl terminus of RAD52 may be species-specific. In this study, we show that human RAD52 physically associates with human RAD51 in vitro and in vivo. Additionally, the region of the RAD52 protein that provides this interaction with RAD51 has been determined. This RAD52 region shows no homology with yeast S. cerevisiae RAD52. These results suggest that a species-specific interaction between human RAD51 and RAD52 may be important for homologous recombination and/or DSB repair in mammalian cells. The yeast MATCHMAKER two-hybrid system (Clontech Laboratories, Palo Alto, CA) was used as one of the systems to test protein-protein interaction in vivo. Yeast strain, SFY526 (MATa; ura3-52; his3-200; ade 2-101; lys2-801; trp1-901; leu2-3, 112; canr; gal4-542; gal80-538; URA3::GAL1-lacZ) (32.Bartel P. Chien C.T. Strenglanz R. Fields S. BioTechniques. 1993; 14: 920-924PubMed Google Scholar) was used as the host for the in vivo interaction studies. Plasmid pGBT9 (TRP1+) was used to fuse the Gal4 DNA binding domain (Gal4-DB, residues 1-147 of Gal4) to the amino terminus of either RAD52 or RAD51 protein and pGAD424 (LEU2+) to fuse the Gal4 activation domain (Gal4-DA, residues 768-881 of Gal-4)(33.Bartel P. Chien C.T. Strenglanz R. Fields S. Hartley D.A. Cellular Interactions in Development: A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, Oxford1993: 153-179Google Scholar). To clone the RAD51 or RAD52 cDNA into the two-hybrid vector, PCR was used to generate the inserts. These inserts contained a BamHI site at the 5′ ends and a stop codon and a SalI site at the 3′ ends. The PCR products digested with BamHI and SalI were ligated into the two-hybrid vectors that had been pre-digested with the same enzymes. Final constructs were sequenced by automated sequencing (Applied Biosystems Inc.). The full-size RAD51 cDNA insert was PCR-amplified from a cDNA library, and its sequence was compared to published cDNA sequences(19.Yoshimura Y. Morita T. Yamamoto A. Matsushiro A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 1655Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 20.Shinohara A. Ogawa H. Matsuda Y. Ushio N. Ikeo K. Ogawa T. Nature Genet. 1993; 4: 239-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The full-length or truncated human RAD52 cDNAs that were fused with either the Gal4-DB (pGBT-52) or the Gal4-DA (pGAD-52) were constructed by ligating the RAD52 cDNA synthesized by PCR from a RAD52 cDNA clone(30.Shen Z. Denison K. Lobb R. Gatewood J.M. Chen D.J. Genomics. 1995; 25: 199-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). To determine the potential interactions between RAD51 and RAD52 proteins, plasmids for the two fusion constructs (one fused with the Gal4-DB, the other fused with Gal4-DA) were co-transfected into the SFY526 using the polyethylene glycol/lithium acetate method(34.Gietz D. St. Jean A. Woods R.A. Schiestl R.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 1425Crossref PubMed Scopus (2857) Google Scholar). Transformed yeast cells were selected on Trp-/Leu- synthetic agar plates for 3 days at 30°C. Three independent transformants were then transferred to gridded filter paper and grown overnight on Trp-/Leu- plates. These clones were then frozen in liquid nitrogen for 5-10 s, placed on top of another filter which was presoaked in Z-buffer (60 mM Na2HPO4•7H20, 40 mM NaH2PO4•H2O, 100 mM KCl, 1 mM MgSO4•7H2O, pH 7.0) containing 0.27% (v/v) 2-mecapthoethanol and 0.334% (w/v) of 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-D-galactoside, and incubated at 30°C. Either 5 ml or 1.5 ml of Z-buffer was used for a 150-mm or a 100-mm filter, respectively. Interaction between these two fusion protein was monitored by color development at 1 h, 2 h, 4 h, 8 h, and 24 h postincubation. Clones that developed visible blue color by 1 h were registered as +++, 2-4 h as ++, and 8-16 h as +-. If no color developed after 16 h, clones were recorded as -. Coding regions of both proteins were cloned into a T7 promoter-based bacterial expression vector(35.Studier F.W. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Dubendorff J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 60-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (5977) Google Scholar), pET28, purchased from Novagene, Inc. (Madison, WI). The resulting plasmids were designated pET-hRAD51 and pET-hRAD52. BL21(DE3) strain of E. coli was transformed with either pET-hRAD51 or pET-hRAD52, induced with isopropyl-1-thio-β-D-galactoside and harvested for protein purification. Proteins were purified by a combination of metal-chelate affinity and Mono Q ion exchange column chromatography. The biochemical activities of RAD51 including ATP hydrolysis and DNA binding were demonstrated. 2M. S. Park, manuscript in preparation. Spodoptera frugiperda cells (Sf9) were kindly provided by Glenn Godwin at Life Technologies, Inc. and grown in Sf-900 II SFM medium (Life Technologies, Inc.). Cells were maintained and infected either as monolayer or in suspension on a rotary shaker in a low temperature incubator set at 27°C. Cells were routinely infected with 10 plaque-forming units of recombinant virus per ml of culture at a density of 1 × 106 cells (>95% viability) per ml. Linearized wild type baculovirus (BaculoGold−) and transfer vector pVL1393 were purchased from Pharmingen (San Diego, CA) and Invitrogen (San Diego, CA), respectively. The recombinant transfer vectors pVL1393-hRAD51 and pVL1393-hRAD52 were constructed from the transfer vector pVL1393 and the plasmid pET-hRAD51 or pET-hRAD52. The resulting constructs were then co-transfected with the linearized wild type baculovirus DNA (BaculoGold−) into Sf9 cells by the cationic liposome method, as described by the manufacturer's instruction (Invitrogen). Recombinant BaculoGold-hRAD51 or BaculoGold-hRAD52 baculoviruses were detected by visual inspection and were further screened by PCR. For the co-expression of RAD51 and RAD52 in single Sf9 cells, an equal number of each recombinant virus was used (multiplicity of infection = 10). All methods pertaining to the growth, transfection, screening, and manipulation of the Sf9 cells and baculovirus have been described elsewhere (36.Summers M.D. Smith G.E. Texas Agric. Exp. Station Bull. 1987; 1555Google Scholar, 37.O'Reilly D.R. Miller A.K. Luckow V.A. Baculovirus Expression Vectors. A Laboratory Manual. W. H. Freeman and Company, New York1992Google Scholar) unless otherwise indicated. Recombinant RAD52 proteins purified from Escherichia coli were used as antigens to immunize rabbits. Antibody was affinity-purified using protein A membranes (Amicon). Anti-yeast RAD51 was kindly provided by Dr. Patrick Sung (26.Sung P. Science. 1994; 265: 1241-1243Crossref PubMed Scopus (744) Google Scholar) (University of Texas, Galveston). After electrophoresis in SDS (10-20%) polyacrylamide gels, proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose filters using a semi-dry electroblot apparatus. Nitrocellulose sheets were probed for 1 h with a 1:3000 dilution of affinity-purified anti-RAD51 or anti-RAD52 antibodies (stock of A280 = 3) and developed using the indirect alkaline phosphatase procedure(38.Blake M.S. Johnston K.H. Russell-Jones G.J. Gotschlich E.C. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 136: 175-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (1622) Google Scholar). For the immunoprecipitation experiments, insect cells (2 × 106) overexpressing both proteins were harvested after a 48-h postinfection with BaculoGold-hRAD51 and BaculoGold-hRAD52 recombinant viruses. Cells were lysed in buffer A (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 0.02% sodium azide, 1% Nonidet P-40) and protease inhibitors (aprotinin, chymostatin, pepstatin, and leupeptin, 1 μg/ml). Cells were homogenized and clarified by centrifugation (15,000 × g, 30 min) and incubated with either anti-RAD51 or anti-RAD52 antibodies. The supernatant was mixed with 50 μl of protein G-agarose beads at 4°C for 1 h and washed twice with buffer B (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mM EDTA, 0.25% gelatin, 0.02% sodium azide) and once with buffer C (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1% Nonidet P-40). Proteins were eluted from the immunoprecipitate using 100 μl of 2% SDS for 5 min at 37°C, and 5 μl of the eluates was analyzed by immunoblotting using the aforementioned antibodies. Immunoprecipitation of RAD51 and RAD52 from HeLa cell extracts was performed in a similar manner, except the HeLa cells were metabolically labeled with [35S]methionine. RAD52 protein and BSA were coupled to AminoLink-Plus gel (Pierce) following the manufacturer's instructions. RAD52 protein (4 mg) was dialyzed against buffer D (0.1 M sodium phosphate, 0.15 M NaCl, pH 7.2) and mixed with 0.5 ml of AminoLink slurry equilibrated with buffer D. After incubation overnight at 4°C by end-over-end rocking, the slurry was washed with buffer D, and the buffer was replaced by buffer D with 0.1 M cyanoborohydride. The slurry was further incubated overnight at 4°C, quenched with 1 M Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and washed with buffer E (25 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 1 mM EDTA, 5 mM MgCl2, 0.05% sodium azide). BSA (5 mg) was coupled to AminoLink gel following the same procedure. RAD51 protein was incubated in batch with the AminoLink resin coupled with either RAD52 or BSA. RAD51 was dialyzed against buffer E and concentrated by centrifugation through an Amicon Centricon 30 filter. The concentrated RAD51 (250 μg in 250 μl) was mixed with 0.25 ml (drained volume) of the AminoLink resin covalently linked to either RAD52 or BSA. After incubating the mixture for 2 h at 4°C with gentle mixing, the slurry was applied to a polyethylene column. The column was washed with buffer E. The RAD51 were eluted from the column with a step gradient of increasing NaCl concentration; each step (1 ml) contained buffer E plus either 50 mM, 0.15 M, 0.25 M, or 0.5 M NaCl. All steps were carried out at 4°C and a flow rate of 0.2 ml/min. Fractions of 200 μl were collected, the absorbance at 280 nm was measured, and aliquots were used for immunoblot analysis using anti-RAD51 or anti-BSA antibodies to confirm the presence of relevant proteins in each fraction. Deletion mutants expressing the truncated form of RAD52 were made by generating a series of nested deletions of pET-hRAD52 from the amino terminus of RAD52 protein using the ExoIII method(39.Henikoff S. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 155: 156-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar). To use the ExoIII approach to generate deletions in RAD52 cDNA, the original pET-hRAD52 construct was modified by inserting a linker (sense strand: 5′-CATATGGGTACCACTAGTCGGGATCC-3′; antisense strand: 5′-GGATCCCGACTAGTGGTACCCATATG-3′) into the pET-hRAD52 that was restriction-digested with NdeI and BamHI. The modified pET-hRAD52 was restriction-digested with KpnI and BamHI and subjected to ExoIII/mung bean nuclease treatment and subsequent ligation. To further map the interacting domain, two mutants containing a part of the RAD52 protein (amino acids 260-340 and 270-330) were made by ligating the PCR products to pET28b that was restriction-digested with NcoI and XhoI. Mutant constructs were first transformed into an E. coli strain, XL2-Blue (Stratagene), and subsequently screened for clones with a proper RAD52 reading frame. Then, BL21(DE3) was transformed with deletion construct plasmids isolated from XL2-Blue, induced, harvested, and subjected to protein purification. These mutant constructs produced truncated RAD52 proteins with 6 histidine residues at the amino terminus of the protein. Mutant proteins were purified by metal-chelate affinity columns. Purified RAD51 protein was covalently linked to AminoLink resins as described for RAD52 protein. Two hundred μg of mutant RAD52 were mixed with 50 μl of AminoLink slurry coupled with RAD51, incubated for 1 h at 4°C with gentle end-over-end shaking, washed 3 times with buffer F (25 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40), and RAD52 mutant proteins were eluted with buffer G (25 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 500 mM NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40). The eluted proteins were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. To determine whether the human RAD52 protein interacts with human RAD51 protein, the following four constructs that contained the full-length coding regions of either human RAD52 or RAD51 cDNA were made: pGBT52, pGAD52, pGBT51, and pGAD51. Plasmids pGAD424 and pGBT9 were used as negative control. Two plasmids, one derived from pGBT9 (first column in Table 1) and the other from pGAD424 (second column in Table 1) were co-transfected into SFY526 yeast cells by different combinations of these constructs. The enzymatic activity of β-galactosidase (lacZ) resulting from the association of these fusion proteins is shown (Table 1). Table 1 demonstrates that 1) human RAD51 and RAD52 protein can each self-associate, 2) human RAD52 protein associates with the human RAD51 protein.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab The self-association of yeast RAD51 protein and the region responsible for this activity have been reported(12.Donovan J.W. Milne G.T. Weaver D.T. Genes & Dev. 1994; 8: 2552-2562Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). However, self-association of RAD52 protein has not been reported. A comprehensive analysis of the human RAD52 self-association will be reported elsewhere. 3Z. Shen, submitted for publication. Interestingly, we consistently observed weaker interactions between pGAD52 and pGBT51 as compared to interaction between pGBT52 and pGAD51. Plasmid pVA3 that contains mouse p53 protein (amino acids 72-390)/Gal4-DB fusion, and pTD1 that contains SV40 large T-antigen (amino acids 64-708)/Gal4-DA fusion were used as experiment controls. Although p53 interacts with large T-antigen, p53 (amino acids 72-390) and T-antigen (amino acids 64-708) did not interact with human RAD51 or RAD52 in this yeast two-hybrid assay (Table 1). Although the two hybrid data indicated in vivo interaction of human RAD52 and RAD51 proteins in yeast cells, this interaction was relatively weak as compared to the self-association of either protein (Table 1). Therefore, another in vivo experiment was conducted to confirm the association of RAD51 and RAD52. RAD51 and RAD52 were expressed independently or simultaneously in insect cells (Fig. 1A) using recombinant baculoviruses. The RAD51 and RAD52 complex was immunoprecipitated with antibodies specific to either RAD51 or RAD52 (Fig. 1B). The immunoprecipitates prepared by anti-RAD51 antibody contained a polypeptide that cross-reacted with the anti-RAD52 antibody. The immunoprecipitates prepared with anti-RAD52 contained a polypeptide that cross-reacted with the anti-RAD51 antibody. Furthermore, immunoprecipitation experiments with both antibodies on 35S-labeled HeLa cell extracts also indicated physical association of RAD51 and RAD52 (data not shown). These results show that RAD51 and RAD52 interact with each other in vivo. Although the physical association between RAD52 and RAD51 was demonstrated in vivo, it was not clear whether this interaction was a direct one or was mediated by another protein(s) in vivo. In order to distinguish between these possibilities, in vitro interaction studies using purified RAD51 and RAD52 proteins were conducted. For this purpose, RAD51 and RAD52 proteins were expressed in E. coli (Fig. 2A) and purified to near-homogeneity (Fig. 2B). The corresponding antibodies reacted with the purified RAD51 and RAD52 proteins (Fig. 2C). A RAD52 affinity column was constructed by coupling purified RAD52 protein to AminoLink resin at a concentration of 4 mg of RAD52 protein per ml of resin. The resin (0.25 ml) was mixed with 0.25 mg of RAD51 and, after incubating for 2 h at 4°C, washed with increasing concentrations of NaCl. In the absence of NaCl, greater than 90% of RAD51 bound to the resin (Fig. 3). Less than 10% of RAD51 was eluted with NaCl concentrations of 50 and 150 mM. However, upon addition of >250 mM NaCl, ~60% of the bound RAD51 eluted from the column (Fig. 3). The corresponding fractions contained RAD51 as determined by immunoblot (data not shown).Figure 3:Human RAD52 protein affinity chromatography of human RAD51 protein. RAD51 protein was applied to AminoLink resin that had been coupled with either RAD52 or BSA as described under “Materials and Methods.” RAD51 protein was eluted from the column using 1-ml step gradients containing 0 mM, 50 mM, 150 mM, 250 mM, and 500 mM NaCl (arrows). Two hundred-μl fractions were collected, and the absorbances at 280 nm were determined.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) As a control, an identical experiment was carried out with RAD51 protein using AminoLink gel, that had been coupled with BSA instead of RAD52 protein (Fig. 3). In this case, most of the RAD51 protein eluted in the absence of NaCl, with only a low level (less than 5%) bound to the column. Thus, the affinity of RAD51 for the resin coupled to RAD52 protein is due to an interaction of RAD51 with RAD52 protein and not to any nonspecific interactions between the RAD51 and the resin. Therefore, this experiment shows that the interaction between human RAD52 and RAD51 is direct. To identify the region(s) in the RAD52 protein that mediates the demonstrated interaction, in vitro and in vivo experiments were performed. For the in vitro experiment, a series of deletion mutants of RAD52 was generated and purified to apparent homogeneity (Fig. 4A). Mutant RAD52 proteins were tested by affinity chromatography with the RAD51 column. But this time the concentration of NaCl was fixed to 0.5 M to elute RAD52 proteins that were bound to the RAD51 column. As shown (Fig. 4B), a small region in RAD52 (amino acids 291-330) was accountable for the interaction of RAD52 with the RAD51 column. For the in vivo experiment, a series of truncated RAD52 cDNAs were fused to the Gal4-DB in vector pGBT9. These constructs were co-transfected with pGAD51 into SFY526 cells. lacZ activity resulting from the interaction of Gal4-DB/RAD52 fusion constructs with full size RAD51/Gal4-DA fusion protein was assayed. Table 2 indicates that the amino acids 287-333 are responsible for the interaction in yeast cells. Based on the in vivo and in vitro results taken together, we conclude that the RAD51 interaction domain of human RAD52 protein resides in the region of 291-330.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab The data presented in this study clearly indicate that human RAD51 and RAD52 proteins physically associate both in vivo and in vitro. Similar results have been described for yeast RAD51 and RAD52 proteins(10.Shinohara A. Ogawa H. Ogawa T. Cell. 1992; 69: 457-470Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1041) Google Scholar, 11.Milne G.T. Weaver D.T. Genes & Dev. 1993; 7: 1755-1765Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 12.Donovan J.W. Milne G.T. Weaver D.T. Genes & Dev. 1994; 8: 2552-2562Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The present study further mapped the human RAD52 region that interacts with the human RAD51 protein. A region of approximately 40 amino acids near the carboxyl terminus of RAD52 is required for interaction with RAD51 in vitro. Previous reports have shown that the human RAD51 protein cannot complement the Rad51 defect in yeast S. cerevisiae(10.Shinohara A. Ogawa H. Ogawa T. Cell. 1992; 69: 457-470Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1041) Google Scholar), and yeast K. lactis RAD51 has little ability to restore the Rad51 defect in yeast S. cerevisiae(12.Donovan J.W. Milne G.T. Weaver D.T. Genes & Dev. 1994; 8: 2552-2562Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Since the RAD51 interaction region(291-330) of human RAD52 does not share homology with the yeast RAD52 protein, the interaction between RAD51 and RAD52 appears to be species-specific. This specificity does not appear to be determined by the RAD51 protein, because RAD51 and its homologs are well conserved. The RAD52 self-association region has been mapped to its amino-terminal region,3 which is independent of the RAD51 interaction region. Therefore, we have demonstrated that the human RAD52 protein has at least two domains responsible for protein-protein interactions. Self-association of human RAD51 is consistent with the results seen in yeast(12.Donovan J.W. Milne G.T. Weaver D.T. Genes & Dev. 1994; 8: 2552-2562Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). This self-association may be required for self-assembly of RAD51 on DNA to form nucleofilaments with a characteristic regularity that has been observed previously(27.Benson F.E. Stasiak A. West S.C. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5764-5771Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). The homotypic interaction domain of human RAD51 appears to be present near its amino terminus 4Z. Shen, K. G. Cloud, D. J. Chen, and M. S. Park, unpublished data. as seen with yeast RAD51 protein(12.Donovan J.W. Milne G.T. Weaver D.T. Genes & Dev. 1994; 8: 2552-2562Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The yeast RAD51 protein has been shown to exhibit the catalytic activities of strand exchange and homologous pairing(26.Sung P. Science. 1994; 265: 1241-1243Crossref PubMed Scopus (744) Google Scholar). More recently, the human RAD51 has been shown to bind to DNA and also form RecA-like nucleofilaments on DNA(27.Benson F.E. Stasiak A. West S.C. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5764-5771Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar), suggesting the possibility that the human RAD51 also possesses either or both homologous pairing and strand exchange activities(29.Park M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15467-15470Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The yeast RAD52 protein can bind to both single- and double-stranded DNAs in the absence of ATP and carries out annealing of homologous single-stranded DNA(40.Ogawa T. Shinohara A. Nabetani A. Ikeya T. Yu X. Egelman E.H. Ogawa H. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1993; 58: 567-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). It can also promote the strand transfer reaction(40.Ogawa T. Shinohara A. Nabetani A. Ikeya T. Yu X. Egelman E.H. Ogawa H. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1993; 58: 567-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). However, the reaction was ATP-independent and had an efficiency only 5% of that of the RecA protein(40.Ogawa T. Shinohara A. Nabetani A. Ikeya T. Yu X. Egelman E.H. Ogawa H. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1993; 58: 567-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Besides the heterotypic and homotypic interactions of RAD52, there is no direct information about the biochemical activities of the mammalian RAD52 protein to date. Although it can be speculated that the RAD52 protein might modulate the catalytic activities of RAD51 based upon the information presented in this study showing the direct association of RAD52 and RAD51 in vivo and in vitro. The catalytic activity of yeast RAD51 can be exhibited in the absence of RAD52 protein in vitro.2 However, a finer tuning of these processes in vivo may require other proteins such as RAD52. Overexpression of the RAD52 protein in monkey cells provides a positive effect on homologous recombination and protection from ionizing radiation(29.Park M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15467-15470Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). These results may further support the notion of the RAD52 protein as a positive modulator of RAD51 activities for DSB repair in mammalian cells. However, more direct evidence for this hypothesis needs to be drawn from biochemical experiments in the presence of both proteins in vitro. We wish to thank Dr. Ronald Gary for critical reading of the manuscript and Dr. Patrick Sung for providing the anti-yeast RAD51 antibody for this study."

Using mitotic spindles assembled in Xenopus egg extracts and different recombinant GST-Xklp2 mutants, we show that this motor is targeted to spindle poles through its C-terminal domain. Xklp2-truncated polypeptides lacking the motor domain block centrosome separation and disrupt preassembled metaphase spindles. Antibodies directed against the tail of Xklp2 have a similar effect. These results show that Xklp2 protein is required for centrosome separation and maintenance of spindle bipolarity.

In the absence of DNA, the clamp associates with the clamp loader. But after the clamp is placed on DNA, the polymerase develops a tight grip on the clamp and out-competes the clamp loader. After replication of the template, the polymerase looses affinity for the clamp. Now the clamp loader regains access to the clamp and removes it from DNA thus recycling it for future use."
https://openalex.org/W1585888204,"Human interleukin-8 receptors A (IL-8RA) and B (IL-8RB) are seven-transmembrane domain (TMD) neutrophil chemokine receptors with similar sequences (77% amino acid identity) and similar G protein selectivity, but markedly different selectivity for CXC chemokines. IL-8RB is selective for IL-8, growth-related oncogene α (GROα) and neutrophil-activating peptide-2 (NAP-2), whereas IL-8RA is selective only for IL-8. To identify selectivity determinants, we made eight chimeric receptors exchanging: 1) the three main regions of sequence divergence between IL-8RA and IL-8RB (the N-terminal segment before TMD1, the region from TMD4 to the end of the second extracellular (e2) loop, and the C-terminal tail), and 2) the N-terminal segment of CC chemokine receptor 1, which does not bind CXC chemokines. Chimeras were tested by direct 125I-IL-8, 125I-GROα, and 125I-NAP-2 binding, heterologous competition binding, and calcium flux assays using human embryonic kidney 293 cells stably transfected with receptor DNAs. The following results were obtained: 1) chimeric receptors had binding sites for IL-8, GROα and NAP-2 distinct from those on IL-8RA and IL-8RB; 2) IL-8, GROα and NAP-2 bound to overlapping but distinct sites that mapped differentially to multiple domains on IL-8RB; 3) high affinity radioligand binding and high agonist potency were separable functions for IL-8, GROα and NAP-2, suggesting that the determinants of high affinity binding may not be critical for receptor activation; and 4) determinants of GROα and NAP-2 selectivity were found in both the N-terminal segment before TMD1 and the region from TMD4 to the end of the e2 loop of IL-8RB, and functioned independently of each other. Stated reciprocally, the N-terminal segment of IL-8RA was not a dominant selectivity determinant.

All three molecules are relatively selective for neutrophils, binding to the same Gi-coupled 7-transmembrane domain (7TMD) receptor named interleukin-8 receptor B (IL-8RB; (2.Murphy P.M. Tiffany H.L.

While it is thought that IL-8, GROα, and NAP-2 act beneficially in host defense and tissue repair, there is so far little direct evidence. On the contrary, IL-8 has great pathologic potential, shown most clearly by the ability of intravenous infusions of anti-IL-8 antibodies to block lung ischemia-reperfusion injury (4.Sekido N.

Thus, IL-8 antagonists could be useful clinically in disorders that have an acute inflammatory component, and substantial efforts are already under way to develop them.

By analogy with the structure of rhodopsin, the membrane-spanning segments of all 7TMD receptors are thought to be arranged in a circle, causing the extracellular domains to bunch together (reviewed in (6.Strader C.D. Fong T.M. Tota M.R. Underwood D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 101-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (990) Google Scholar)). Very small ligands such as catecholamines bind mainly to TMD determinants, and very large glycoprotein ligands such as thyroid-stimulating hormone bind mainly to the unusually long N-terminal segment of their respective receptors(6.Strader C.D. Fong T.M. Tota M.R. Underwood D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 101-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (990) Google Scholar). Small peptide ligands such as the neurokinins appear to bind to sites in the extracellular loops and TMDs(6.Strader C.D. Fong T.M. Tota M.R. Underwood D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 101-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (990) Google Scholar). Chemokines are intermediate in size, ~70 amino acids, and chemokine receptors have relatively small N-terminal segments(1.Baggiolini M. Dewald B. Moser B. Adv. Immunol. 1994; 55: 97-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (2251) Google Scholar, 3.Murphy P.M. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1994; 12: 593-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (1121) Google Scholar). Since the potential cumulative binding surface of the chemokine receptor ectodomains is comparable in size to that of the ligand and since receptor binding is sensitive to truncation of both N- and C-terminal residues of IL-8(7.Clark-Lewis I. Schumacher C. Baggiolini M. Moser B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23128-23134Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), it is likely that chemokine binding determinants are broadly distributed on multiple domains of the receptors. C5a is a non-chemokine chemotactic peptide for leukocytes that is similar in size to chemokines(3.Murphy P.M. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1994; 12: 593-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (1121) Google Scholar). It has been shown to bind to at least two sites on a specific 7TMD receptor that is similar in size, organization and sequence to IL-8RB(8.Gerard N.P. Gerard C. Nature. 1991; 349: 614-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar, 9.Siciliano S.J. DeMartino J. Konteatis Z. Malkowitz L. Rollins T.E. Van Riper G. Bondy S. Rosen H. Springer M.S. Proc. Natl.

The first experiments aimed at identifying receptor regions important for chemokine binding by IL-8RB took advantage of the fact that a second high affinity 7TMD neutrophil IL-8 receptor exists (IL-8RA) that is 77% identical in amino acid sequence to IL-8RB, yet binds neither GROα nor NAP-2(10.Holmes W.E.

Most of the divergent residues are clustered in three regions: 1) the N-terminal segment before TMD1, 2) the region from TMD4 to the end of the second extracellular (e2) loop, and 3) the C-terminal cytoplasmic tail (Fig. 1).

The two groups reported conflicting results for the reciprocal chimera BA1; LaRosa et al.(13.LaRosa G.J. Thomas K.M. Kaufmann M.E. Mark. R. White M. Taylor L. Gray G. Witt D. Navarro J. J. Biol.

Neither study addressed direct binding of either 125I-GROα or 125I-NAP-2 or receptor activation, and the approach taken was not designed to identify the determinants of IL-8 selectivity. Moreover, the reported inability of human GROα and NAP-2 to compete effectively for 125I-human IL-8 binding sites on the rabbit counterpart of IL-8RB raised the possibility that the properties of cross- and same-species IL-8 receptor chimeras could be fundamentally different(16.Prado G.N. Thomas K.M. Suzuki H. LaRosa G.J. Wilkinson N. Folco E. Navarro J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12391-12394Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this paper we have addressed all of these concerns, by investigating both the agonist selectivity and ligand binding selectivity for wild type human IL-8RA and IL-8RB, and for a series of eight chimeric IL-8 receptors. We present a substantially expanded interpretation of the importance of the N-terminal segment in human IL-8 receptor subtype determination that is based on new findings regarding the complexity of CXC chemokine binding sites. All receptor constructs were first subcloned into Bluescript SKII+ (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) and then transferred into the NotI and XhoI sites of the hygromycin-selectable, stable episomal vector pCEP4 (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA). The sources of receptor DNA were as follows: IL-8RA, an EcoRV/HindIII genomic fragment(17.Ahuja S.K. Shetty A. Tiffany H.L. Murphy P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26381-26389Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); IL-8RB, the p3 cDNA(2.Murphy P.M. Tiffany H.L. Science. 1991; 253: 1280-1283Crossref PubMed Scopus (747) Google Scholar); and CC CKR1 (also known as the MIP1α/RANTES receptor), the p4 cDNA(18.Gao J.-L. Kuhns D.B. Tiffany H.L. McDermott D. Li X. Francke U. Murphy P.M. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 177: 1421-1427Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). Seven chimeric receptors were made by ligating restriction fragments of IL-8RA and IL-8RB taking advantage of conserved AccI, EcoNI, BamHI, and NcoI restriction endonuclease sites (Fig. 1). One chimera was made from IL-8RB and CC CKR1 DNA by polymerase chain reaction techniques (Fig. 1). The names and sequence compositions of the chimeric receptors are as follows: AB1, IL-8RA (aa 1-45) and IL-8RB (aa 55-360); BA1, IL-8RB (aa 1-54) and IL-8RA (aa 46-350); AB5, IL-8RA (aa 1-203) and IL-8RB (aa 213-360); AB7, IL-8RA (aa 1-313) and IL-8RB (aa 323-360); BA5, IL-8RB (aa 1-212) and IL-8RA (aa 204-350); ABA, IL-8RA (aa 1-109), IL-8RB (aa 119-212), and IL-8RA (aa 204-350); BAB, IL-8RB (aa 1-119), IL-8RA (aa 110-203), and IL-8RB (aa 213-360); CC CKR1/IL-8RB, CC CKR1 (aa 1-34) and IL-8RB (aa 51-360). The numbers in the names of the first five chimeras listed denote the TMD where the switch occurs. In AB1 and BA1 all the divergent residues in the exchanged regions precede aa 37 of IL-8RA and aa 46 of IL-8RB. Thus, the switched divergent residues correspond to those studied in LaRosa et al.(13.LaRosa G.J. Thomas K.M. Kaufmann M.E. Mark. R. White M. Taylor L. Gray G. Witt D. Navarro J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25402-25406Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and Gayle et al.(14.Gayle III, R.B. Sleath P.R. Srinivason S. Birks C.W. Weerawarna K.S. Cerretti D.P. Kozlosky C.J. Nelson N. Vanden Bos T. Beckmann M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7283-7289Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The fidelity of the cloned expression plasmids was verified by DNA sequencing. Human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells (107), grown to log phase in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum, were electroporated with 20 μg of plasmid DNA as described previously(19.Combadiere C. Ahuja S.K. Murphy P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16491-16494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Multiple hygromycin-resistant colonies were picked and expanded in 150 μg/ml hygromycin. HEK 293 cell transfectants (107/ml) were suspended in Hank's buffered saline solution with Ca2+ and Mg2+ and 10 mM Hepes, pH 7.4, containing 2.5 μM FURA-2 AM for 30 min at 37°C in the dark. The cells were subsequently washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline and then resuspended in Hank's buffered saline solution with Ca2+ and Mg2+ at 2 × 106 cells/ml. 2 ml of the cell suspension were placed in a continuously stirred cuvette maintained at 37°C in a MSIII fluorimeter (Photon Technology International Inc., South Brunswick, NJ). Fluorescence was monitored at λex1 = 340 nm, λex2 = 380 nm, and λem = 510 nm, and the data presented as the relative ratio of fluorescence at 340 and 380 nm. Data were collected every 100-200 ms. To determine the agonist selectivity, the magnitude of the peak of [Ca2+]i changes elicited at varying concentrations of human CXC and CC chemokines (Peprotech, Rocky Hill, NJ) from transfected HEK 293 cells was determined. Each graphed point represents the peak response for one tracing. Each graph is from a single experiment representative of at least three separate experiments for a single clone and represents four separate clones tested. To determine the ligand binding selectivity, 106 stably transfected cells were incubated in duplicate with ~0.1 nM125I-IL-8, 125I-GROα, or 125I-NAP-2, each having a specific activity ~2200 Ci/mmol (DuPont NEN) and varying concentrations of unlabeled recombinant human chemokines in 200 μl of binding medium (RPMI 1640 with 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, pH 7.4). After incubation for 2 h at 4°C, cells were pelleted through a 10% sucrose/phosphate-buffered saline cushion and γ emissions were counted. The data were curve-fitted with the computer program LIGAND (20.Munson P.J. Rodbard D. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 107: 220-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (7759) Google Scholar) to determine the Ki and number of binding sites. To control for inter-experiment variability, the ligand binding profile of IL-8RB was analyzed concurrently on the same day that the ligand binding selectivity of an individual chimeric construct was determined. Maximum binding was determined as the percentage of total added counts that remained associated with the cell pellet, and is shown in the parentheses that follows the name of the corresponding radioligand in Figure 2:, Figure 3:, Figure 4:, Figure 5:. The binding data depicted in Figure 2:, Figure 3:, Figure 4:, Figure 5: are for the clone whose agonist properties are also shown. The binding data shown are representative of three separate experiments for each clone and for two separate clones. Nonspecific binding was less than 10% of total binding in all experiments. When [Ca2+]i changes were used to monitor receptor activation, we found that the cell lines stably expressing IL-8RA and IL-8RB responded to IL-8, GROα, and NAP-2, but not to the CC chemokines MIP-1α and MCP-1 (Fig. 2, a and e). In the case of IL-8RA, IL-8 was a strong agonist (EC50 = 3 nM), whereas GROα and NAP-2 were weak (Fig. 2a). In the case of IL-8RB, IL-8, GROα and NAP-2 were all strong agonists with similar potency to each other and to the potency of IL-8 for IL-8RA (Fig. 2, a and e). The relative binding affinities of IL-8, GROα, and NAP-2 for IL-8RA and IL-8RB correlated well with their relative potencies as agonists. In the case of IL-8RA, 125I-IL-8 bound with high affinity (Ki= 3.6 nM; Fig. 2b), whereas 125I-GROα and 125I-NAP-2 binding was not detectable (Fig. 2, c and d). Nevertheless, an interaction of GROα and NAP-2 with IL-8RA could be inferred by their ability to compete weakly for the 125I-IL-8-labeled sites on IL-8RA (Fig. 2b). In the case of IL-8RB, 125I-IL-8, 125I-GROα, and 125I-NAP-2 all were strong ligands, binding with similar affinities (Fig. 2, f-h, and Table 1). These affinities were also similar to the binding affinity for 125I-IL-8 on IL-8RA (Table 1).Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab The rank order of competition by unlabeled CXC chemokines for the radiolabeled binding sites on IL-8RB varied considerably for the three different radioligands (Fig. 2, f-h, and Table 1). For example, unlabeled NAP-2 competed poorly for the 125I-IL-8-labeled sites on IL-8RB, whereas both NAP-2 and IL-8 were very effective in competing for the 125I-NAP-2-labeled sites on IL-8RB. These findings suggest that the sets of binding sites on IL-8RB for IL-8, GROα and NAP-2 overlap but are not identical. The unlabeled CC chemokines MIP-1α and MCP-1 did not compete for binding at any of the CXC chemokine-labeled sites (Fig. 2, f-h). These results confirm previous reports based on direct IL-8 and GROα binding (11.Lee J. Horuk R. Rice G.C. Bennett G.L. Camerato T. Wood W.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16283-16287Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12.Cerretti D.P. Kozlosky C.J. Vanden Bos T. Nelson N. Gearing D.P. Beckmann M.P. Mol.

To investigate the structural basis of the markedly different selectivities found for IL-8RA and IL-8RB, we made chimeric receptors in which the main regions of divergence were switched. GROα and NAP-2 competed very weakly for IL-8 binding to the rabbit-human AB1 chimeras studied in LaRosa et al.(13.LaRosa G.J. Thomas K.M. Kaufmann M.E. Mark. R. White M. Taylor L. Gray G. Witt D. Navarro J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25402-25406Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and Gayle et al.(14.Gayle III, R.B. Sleath P.R. Srinivason S. Birks C.W. Weerawarna K.S. Cerretti D.P.

Chem. 1993; 268: 7283-7289Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), having a rank order indistinguishable from IL-8RA, and suggesting logically that the N-terminal segment of the IL-8 receptors was a major determinant of receptor subtype selectivity. We were surprised, therefore, to find that GROα and NAP-2 were both strong agonists for our human-human chimera AB1, having a rank order very similar to that of IL-8RB (Fig. 3a). The agonist selectivity of the complementary chimera BA1 was not complementary to AB1 and differed from both wild type receptors, but was much closer to IL-8RB than IL-8RA both in relative agonist potency and efficacy (Fig. 3e). From these results we infer that independent determinants of GROα and NAP-2 agonist selectivity are present in the IL-8RB-specific sequences both N-terminal and C-terminal to the switch point in TMD1. LaRosa et al.(13.LaRosa G.J. Thomas K.M. Kaufmann M.E. Mark. R. White M. Taylor L. Gray G. Witt D. Navarro J. J. Biol.

To compare more directly the properties of human-human AB1 and BA1 with those of rabbit-human chimeras, we carried out ligand binding experiments. In fact, the rank order of competition for the 125I-IL-8 binding site on human-human AB1 was identical to that reported for rabbit-human AB1 and mimicked that for wild type human IL-8RA (compare Fig. 2b and Fig. 3b, and Table 1). To address the apparent incompatibility between the indirect ligand binding and signal transduction results for GROα and NAP-2, we carried out direct 125I-GROα (Fig. 3c) and 125I-NAP-2 (Fig. 3d) binding with AB1, and found that both radioligands were able to bind with high affinity. The rank orders of competition determined with unlabeled CXC chemokines indicate clearly that the sets of binding sites for 125I-IL-8, 125I-GROα, and 125I-NAP-2 on AB1 are overlapping but distinct from each other, and distinct from the corresponding sites on IL-8RB (compare Fig. 3, panels b-d, and Fig. 2, panels f-h; see also Table 1). Chimera BA1 also had binding properties distinct from both wild type receptors. Despite the fact that IL-8 was its most potent agonist, similar in potency to wild type IL-8RB (EC50 = 10 and 5 nM, respectively; Fig. 2e and 3e), we could not demonstrate specific binding of 125I-IL-8 to it (Fig. 3f). This matches the report of Gayle et al. for rabbit-human BA1 (14.Gayle III, R.B. Sleath P.R. Srinivason S. Birks C.W. Weerawarna K.S. Cerretti D.P. Kozlosky C.J. Nelson N. Vanden Bos T. Beckmann M.P.

Witt D. Navarro J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25402-25406Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, 125I-GROα (Fig. 3g) and 125I-NAP-2 (Fig. 3h) both bound to BA1 with high affinity. As for AB1, competition binding analysis with unlabeled CXC chemokines distinguished the binding sites for 125I-GROα and 125I-NAP-2 on BA1 from those on IL-8RB (compare panels g and h in Figure 2:, Figure 3:; see also Table 1). To test further the importance of IL-8RB regions C-terminal to TMD1 for GROα and NAP-2 selectivity, we replaced residues 1-50 of IL-8RB with the corresponding residues of the CC chemokine restricted receptor CC CKR1 (amino acids 1-34), making chimera CC CKR1/IL-8RB. The switched residues comprise the N-terminal segments of the respective receptors (2.Murphy P.M. Tiffany H.L. Science. 1991; 253: 1280-1283Crossref PubMed Scopus (747) Google Scholar, 18.Gao J.-L. Kuhns D.B. Tiffany H.L. McDermott D. Li X. Francke U. Murphy P.M. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 177: 1421-1427Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). The sequence of residues 1-34 of CC CKR1 differs markedly from the corresponding sequence of IL-8RA and IL-8RB, but all three have a high content of acidic residues and several invariant residues are present (Fig. 1). This chimera is also useful for mapping determinants of IL-8 selectivity in IL-8RB, which cannot be meaningfully analyzed in chimeras made from the two IL-8 receptors. As for AB1, IL-8, GROα, and NAP-2 all had high equipotent agonist activity for CC CKR1/IL-8RB (Fig. 3i). In contrast, the agonists for CC CKR1 (MIP-1α, RANTES, and MCP-3) lacked agonist activity for CC CKR1/IL-8RB (Fig. 3i). The agonist rank order was IL-8 = GROα~ NAP-2 (EC50~ 10 nM in each case), similar to that for wild type IL-8RB and chimera AB1 (Table 1). This further suggested that IL-8RB sequence C-terminal to TMD1 contains determinants of GROα and NAP-2 agonist selectivity that can operate independently of GROα and NAP-2 determinants in the N-terminal segment of IL-8RB. Furthermore, it indicated that the same region of IL-8RB contains determinants of IL-8 agonist selectivity. As we found for AB1 and BA1, all of the binding sites on CC CKR1/IL-8RB were distinct from those on the wild type receptors (Fig. 3, j-l). The least unusual was the NAP-2 site (Fig. 3l). 125I-NAP-2 bound to CC CKR1/IL-8RB with high affinity (Ki = 1 nM). However, the rank order of competition for 125I-NAP-2 binding was NAP-2 > GROα > IL-8 for CC CKR1/IL-8RB (Fig. 3l; Table 1) as compared to IL-8~GROα > NAP-2 for IL-8RB (Table 1). Binding of 125I-GROα to CC CKR1/IL-8RB was much more anomalous. A high percentage of total radioligand added bound to cells expressing CC CKR1/IL-8RB; however, unlabeled GROα did not compete for binding even when present in 500-fold molar excess (Fig. 3k). Paradoxically, unlabeled IL-8 competed for the 125I-GROα site on CC CKR1/IL-8RB, but not very effectively (Fig. 3k). NAP-2 did not compete for 125I-GROα binding, even though 125I-NAP-2 bound with high affinity (Fig. 3, k and l). The IL-8 binding site on CC CKR1/IL-8RB was even more unusual and was reminiscent of the IL-8 binding site on BA1. Even though IL-8 was a potent agonist for CC CKR1/IL-8RB, 125I-IL-8 binding was not detectable (Fig. 3, i and j). However, a binding interaction of IL-8 with CC CKR1/IL-8RB could be inferred by its ability to compete for the 125I-GROα and 125I-NAP-2 sites (Fig. 3, k and l). Taken together, the results suggest that the determinants of high affinity 125I-IL-8 binding differ from the determinants of high agonist activity for IL-8, and that the N-terminal segment of IL-8RB contains determinants of high affinity 125I-IL-8 binding. The latter conclusion is consistent with the results of Suzuki et al.(21.Suzuki H. Prado G.N. Wilkinson N. Navarro J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18263-18266Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), who reported that a chimeric receptor composed of the N-terminal segment of rabbit IL-8RA and the sequence C-terminal to TMD1 of the mouse IL-8 receptor homologue bound 125I-human IL-8 with high affinity, whereas the wild type mouse IL-8 receptor homologue did not(22.Cerretti D.P.

Thus, these Ras-binding domains recognize distinct Ras-GTP determinants, and both may be essential for Ras transforming activity.

Although substantial evidence supports the importance of Ras-Raf-1 interactions for Ras-mediated signaling and transformation, the precise role of Ras in activating Raf-1 remains unresolved(7.Morrison D. Science. 1994; 266: 56-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). The potent transforming activity of membrane-targeted forms of Raf-1 suggests that Ras-mediated translocation of Raf-1 to the plasma membrane is an important step in Raf-1 activation(8.Leevers S.J.

However, it is clear that Ras-Raf-1 interaction alone is not sufficient, and subsequent Ras-independent events are required for full Raf-1 kinase activation.

Whether Ras simply promotes Raf-1 membrane association or also modulates the subsequent activation events is presently unclear. Yeast two-hybrid and in vitro binding studies demonstrated that Raf-1 residues 55-131 are sufficient for stable association with Ras(20.Vojtek A.B. Hollenberg S.M. Cooper J.A. Cell. 1993; 74: 205-214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1645) Google Scholar, 21.Chuang E. Barnard D. Hettich L. Zhang X.-f. Avruch J. Marshall M.S. Mol. Cell.

Additionally, recent structural studies conducted with both Ras and the Ras-related protein, Rap1A, indicate that Raf-1 residues 55-131 interact with residues 33-41 in the Ras effector region(23.Nassar N. Horn G. Herrmann C. Scherer A. McCormick F. Wittinghofer A. Nature. 1995; 375: 554-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar, 24.Emerson S.D. Waugh D.S. Scheffler J.E. Tsao K.-L. Prinzo K.M. Fry D.C. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7745-7752Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Finally, the critical role for Raf residues 55-131 in Ras-mediated activation of Raf-1 is demonstrated by the ability of a point mutation, Raf (R89L), to disrupt Ras-Raf-1 binding and Raf-1 kinase activation(25.Fabian J.R. Vojtek A.B. Cooper J.A. Morrison D.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5982-5986Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). However, observations that mutations outside the Ras effector domain impair Ras-Raf-1 binding and Ras-mediated cell signaling (26.Sung Y.-J. Carter M. Zhong J.-M. Hwang Y.-W.

Kaziro Y. Yokoyama S. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 2153-2157PubMed Google Scholar) suggest that other Ras recognition elements may contribute to Raf-1 kinase regulation. We have recently characterized a second Ras-GTP-binding site, located in the cysteine-rich domain of Raf-1 (residues 139-184), which interacts with Ras both in vitro and in vivo(29.Brtva T.R. Drugan J.K. Ghosh S. Terrell R.S. Campbell-Burk S. Bell R.M. Der C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9809-9812Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Additionally, peptides from this region blocked Ras-mediated activation of MAPKs(30.Clark, G. J., Drugan, J. K., Terrell, R. S., Bradham, C., Der, C. J., Bell, R. M., Campbell-Burk, S. (1996) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A., in pressGoogle Scholar). The importance of a second Ras-binding domain in Raf-1 is supported by a report that mutations in the Raf-1 cysteine-rich region reduced Raf-1-Ras binding by 55% and Raf-1 kinase activity by 60-90%(27.Chow Y.-H. Pulmiglia K. Jun T.H. Dent P. Sturgill T.W. Jove R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14100-14106Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Moreover, specific mutations in the cysteine-rich or kinase domains of D-Raf reversed the loss of function of a D-Raf variant containing a mutation analogous to c-Raf-1(R89L), leading Perrimon and co-workers (31.Lu X. Chou T.-B. Williams N.G. Roberts T. Perrimon N. Genes & Dev. 1993; 7: 621-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) to speculate that the cysteine-rich domain formed negative regulatory contacts with the kinase domain, which are relieved upon binding Ras. However, it is presently unclear if the Raf-1 cysteine-rich domain recognizes Ras-GTP binding determinants distinct from those that interact with Raf-1 residues 55-131 and if both Ras-Raf-1 interacting sites are required for Ras signaling and transformation. Both Ras recognition sites of Raf-1 preferentially bind Ras-GTP. Therefore, mutations that impair Ras transforming activity by causing disruptions in regions of Ras whose conformation differs between Ras-GDP and Ras-GTP (switch I and II) may disrupt interactions with either Ras-binding site of Raf-1. To investigate the significance of the two Ras-binding sites in Raf-1 and to elucidate the regions of activated Ras-GTP important for interactions with the Raf-1 cysteine-rich region, we determined if mutations that abolished Ras transforming activity also perturbed Ras interaction with the two distinct Ras-interacting fragments of Raf-1. Our observations suggest that the Raf-1 cysteine-rich domain contains a cryptic binding site, which recognizes region(s) of Ras different from those that bind Raf-1 residues 55-131, and both of these Ras-interacting sites may be necessary for Ras-mediated transformation.

The mutant Ha-ras sequences were then introduced into the pAT-ras bacterial expression vector and into the pZIP-NeoSV(X)1 retrovirus vector for expression in mammalian cells(36.Cepko C.L. Roberts B.

Cell lines with stable expression of each mutant Ha-Ras protein were established by maintaining transfected cultures in growth medium supplemented with G418 at 400 μg/ml (Geneticin, Life Technologies, Inc.). Tumorigenicity was determined by subcutaneous inoculation of each cell line (1 × 105 cells/site) into athymic nude mice as described previously(39.Clark G.J. Cox A.D. Graham S.M. Der C.J. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 255: 395-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Ras-GMPPCP was labeled with stoichiometric amounts of [γ-γ-32P]GTP. Ras-GTP (0.2 nM) was incubated with 0.5 mM Raf-1-GST fusion fragments in 20 mM Hepes, pH 7.4, 1 mM MgCl2, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 0.3% Triton X-100 as described elsewhere(40.Zhang X.-f. Marshall M.S. Avruch J. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 255: 323-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). The Ras-Raf-1 complex was isolated by binding the GST-fusion fragment to glutathione-coated agarose beads, and the amount of radiolabeled Ras bound was determined by scintillation counting. Assays were performed at least three times in duplicate with GST background values subtracted from the amount of Ras-GTP detected. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent capture assay was employed as a second, distinct assay to further assess the binding profiles of several non-transforming Ras mutants and has been summarized elsewhere(29.Brtva T.R.

Essentially, 100 pmol of Ras-GMPPCP was plated onto 96-well microtiter plates for 2 h at room temperature.

Although we recently demonstrated that the cysteine-rich domain of Raf-1 (residues 139-184) associates with Ras both in vitro and in vivo(29.Brtva T.R. Drugan J.K. Ghosh S. Terrell R.S.

Chem. 1995; 270: 9809-9812Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar), the role of this interaction in Ras transforming activity is unclear. Given the preferential binding between active GTP-bound Ras and fragments encoding both the cysteine-rich domain (Raf-1 residues 136-188, Raf-Cys) and Raf-1 residues 55-131 (Raf-1 residues 1-140, designated Raf-N)(22.Ghosh S.

Chem. 1995; 270: 9809-9812Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar), we anticipated that Raf-N and Raf-Cys are likely to interact with regions of Ras whose conformation is sensitive to its guanine nucleotide-bound state. Two such regions of Ras identified to undergo conformational changes between GTP- and GDP-bound forms of Ras are commonly referred to as switch I (residues 30-38 in loop 2/β strand 3) and switch II (residues 59-76 of loop 4 and helix 2)(41.Milburn M.V.

Wittinghofer A. Nature. 1989; 341: 209-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (676) Google Scholar). Thus, we evaluated the consequences of mutations that impair oncogenic Ras transforming activities via perturbations in switch I or II on Raf-N and Raf-Cys binding. These analyses may elucidate the region(s) of Ras involved in binding Raf-Cys and establish a role for this interaction in Ras transformation. The biochemical and biological consequences of each mutation to Ras are summarized in Table 1. Like wild type Ras, two different transforming mutants of Ras (G12V and Q61L) retained high affinity binding to both Raf-N and Raf-Cys (Fig. 1A). Given the GTP dependence of Ras interactions with the two Ras-Raf-1 interacting domains of Raf-1, taken together with recent data showing that Raf-1 residues 55-131 bind directly to the switch I domain of Ras (23.Nassar N. Horn G. Herrmann C. Scherer A. McCormick F. Wittinghofer A. Nature. 1995; 375: 554-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar, 24.Emerson S.D. Waugh D.S. Scheffler J.E. Tsao K.-L. Prinzo K.M. Fry D.C. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7745-7752Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), we postulated that Raf-Cys requires the switch II domain for its interaction with Ras. Hence, to better characterize the regions of Ras required for Raf-Cys binding, we determined whether a mutation that disrupted switch II, but not switch I, altered Ras binding to Raf-N or Raf-Cys.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab For these studies, we used Ras G60A and Y64W switch II mutants that abolish oncogenic Ras transforming activity(26.Sung Y.-J.

Ras residue Gly-60 interacts with the γ-phosphate of GTP, and this interaction is believed to be crucial for propagating conformational changes within the switch II domain of Ras. Trypsin cleavage profiles and fluorescence analysis of mutations analogous to the Ras G60A substitution in other GTP-binding proteins (Gsα and EF-Tu) indicate that this mutation disrupts switch II but not switch I(44.Lee E. Taussig R. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1212-1218Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 45.Hwang Y.-W. Jurnak F. Miller D.L. Bosch L. Kraal B. Parmeggiani A.

Moreover, fluorescence analysis using 8-anilino-1-naphthalenesulfonic acid dye complexed with wild type and G60A Ras-GTP provides additional evidence that substitution of alanine for glycine at position 60 alters the active conformation of Ha-Ras(26.Sung Y.-J. Carter M. Zhong J.-M. Hwang Y.-W. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 3470-3477Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Although we detected an association between Raf-N and both the Ras(G60A) and Ras(Y64W) variants, we did not observe complex formation between these Ras mutants and Raf-Cys (Fig. 1B). Thus, these results show that whereas Raf-N interacts with switch I(23.Nassar N. Horn G. Herrmann C. Scherer A. McCormick F. Wittinghofer A. Nature. 1995; 375: 554-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar, 24.Emerson S.D. Waugh D.S. Scheffler J.E. Tsao K.-L. Prinzo K.M. Fry D.C. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7745-7752Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), Raf-Cys requires an intact switch II region for binding to Ras. This is consistent with a previous observation that mutations in the switch II region of Ras (including residue 64) perturb interactions between Ras and various putative effector proteins(47.Moodie S.A. Paris M. Villafranca E. Kirshmeier P. Willumsen B.M. Wolfman A. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 447-454PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, the observation that the G60A and Y64W mutations abolish Ras transforming activity without impairment of Raf-N binding suggests that Ras interaction with Raf-N alone is not sufficient for Ras biological activity. Previous studies have shown that the T35A and E37G effector domain mutations abolished Ras binding to full-length Raf-1 and impaired oncogenic Ras transforming activity(32.White M.A. Nicolette C.

Consistent with the inability of these switch I mutants to bind full-length Raf-1, we were unable to detect a stable complex between T35A and E37G variants of Ras and Raf-N in vitro (Fig. 1B). However, the ability to bind the isolated Raf-Cys domain was retained (Fig. 1B). These results are also consistent with earlier observations that Ras-Raf-N (residues 55-131) binding contacts involve the Ras effector domain (23.Nassar N. Horn G. Herrmann C. Scherer A. McCormick F. Wittinghofer A. Nature. 1995; 375: 554-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar, 24.Emerson S.D. Waugh D.S. Scheffler J.E. Tsao K.-L. Prinzo K.M. Fry D.C. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7745-7752Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) and that these interactions are required for Ras-mediated activation of Raf-1(25.Fabian J.R. Vojtek A.B. Cooper J.A. Morrison D.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5982-5986Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Finally, we had previously observed that mutations R256G, S257L, and S257P in the highly conserved central region of Raf-1 (commonly referred to as the CR2 domain) or the removal of Raf-1 COOH-terminal residues 247-648 are required to allow Ras(G12V, E37G) interaction with Raf-1(32.White M.A. Nicolette C. Minden A. Polverino A. Van Aelst L. Karin M. Wigler M.H. Cell. 1995; 80: 533-541Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar), indicating that the Ras binding determinants in Raf-Cys are masked in full-length Raf-1 (Fig. 2). The inability of Raf-N to complex with the biologically inactive T35A mutant may result from diminished interactions between position 35, magnesium, GTP, and possibly the Asp-38 residue(48.John J.

It is also not surprising that the E37G mutation disrupted interactions with Raf-N, as the x-ray structure of the binding interface between Raf-1 residues 55-131 and Rap1A showed that the Glu-37 residue of Rap1A was in close contact with this Raf-1 sequence and was involved in water-mediated protein-protein interactions. Rap1A shares complete identity with Ras residues 32-40 and can associate with most Ras effectors, including Raf-1, RalGDS, and Ras GTPase-activating proteins (50.Zhang X.-f. Settleman J.

Science. 1990; 249: 169-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). We also determined the consequences of two adjacent Ras effector domain mutations, T35W and I36W, on the properties of normal or oncogenic Ras (Table 1). We found that the Ras T35W mutant, but not I36W, abolished the transforming activity of Ras(Q61L). Instead, the I36W mutation alone was sufficient to activate wild type Ras transforming potential. A similar gain of function mutation at this position has been described previously(53.Stone J. Vass W.C. Willumsen B.M. Lowy D.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 3565-3569Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In contrast to the minor perturbations observed in the switch I region of Ras(I36W), NMR structural studies of the Ras(T35W) mutant showed pronounced alterations in both switch I and switch II. 2J. K. Drugan, R. Khosravi-Far, C. J. Der, and S. L. Campbell, manuscript in preparation. Consistent with our suggestion that Ras interaction with both Raf-N and Raf-Cys is important for Ras transformation, we found that Ras(I36W) retained binding to both Raf-N and Raf-Cys (Fig. 1A), whereas the nontransforming Ras(T35W) mutant failed to interact with either Raf-1 sequence (Fig. 1B). Our analyses of mutations that impair Ras transformation as a consequence of perturbations to either the Ras switch I or switch II domain suggest that Ras transforming activity requires interaction with two distinct NH2-terminal Raf-1 sequences. Furthermore, Raf-N and Raf-Cys demonstrated opposing binding profiles with Ras proteins containing mutations that disrupt switch I (T35A and E37G) versus switch II (G60A and Y64W), indicating that they recognize distinct Ras GTP-binding elements. These observations, together with our demonstration that peptides containing a consensus Ras binding sequence from Raf-Cys can block Ras activation of MAPKs (30.Clark, G. J., Drugan, J. K., Terrell, R. S., Bradham, C., Der, C. J., Bell, R. M., Campbell-Burk, S. (1996) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A., in pressGoogle Scholar), provide strong evidence that Ras interaction with Raf-Cys is a critical step in Ras-mediated activation of Raf-1. Previous studies determined that Raf-N represents a minimal Ras binding sequence and that a mutation in this Raf-1 domain (R89L) prevented Ras interaction and activation of full-length Raf-1(25.Fabian J.R. Vojtek A.B. Cooper J.A. Morrison D.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5982-5986Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Therefore, we speculated that the Ras-binding elements in Raf-Cys are cryptic in the intact unstimulated Raf-1 protein(29.Brtva T.R. Drugan J.K. Ghosh S. Terrell R.S. Campbell-Burk S. Bell R.M. Der C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9809-9812Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). In support of this hypothesis, we have shown in the present study that two Ras effector domain mutations (T35A and E37G), which impair Ras binding to both full-length Raf-1 and Raf-N, did not abolish Ras binding to the isolated Raf-Cys domain. Recent observations that addition of the Ras membrane-targeting sequence onto Raf-1 caused activation of Raf-1 transforming activity suggested that Ras binding to Raf-N was important for Ras-mediated translocation of Raf-1 from the cytosol to the plasma membrane(8.Leevers S.J. Paterson H.F. Marshall C.J. Nature. 1994; 369: 411-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (869) Google Scholar, 9.Stokoe D. Macdonald S.G. Cadwallader K. Symons M. Hancock J.F. Science. 1994; 264: 1463-1466Crossref PubMed Scopus (828) Google Scholar). Once at the membrane, Ras-independent events have been proposed to trigger Raf-1 kinase activation. However, our observation that the G60A and Y64W mutations retained interaction with Raf-N yet abolished oncogenic Ras transforming activity suggests that Ras interaction with Raf-Cys is also required for Raf-1 activation. Therefore, Ras interaction with both Raf-N and Raf-Cys may be necessary to promote Raf-1 association with the plasma membrane. However, several lines of evidence suggest that the NH2-terminal half of Raf-1 serves to negatively regulate the activity of the COOH-terminal kinase domain because mutation, insertion, or deletion of these regions results in oncogenic activation of the Raf-1 kinase(54.Ishikawa F. Sakai R. Ochiai M. Takaku F. Sugimura T. Nagao M. Oncogene. 1988; 3: 653-658PubMed Google Scholar, 55.Stanton V.P. Nichols D.W. Laudano A.P. Cooper G.M. Mol. Cell.

Biol. 1990; 10: 2503-2512Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Therefore, Ras binding to Raf-Cys may relieve the negative regulatory action of the Raf-1 NH2 terminus to allow other events to activate Raf-1. This hypothesis is consistent with our observation that the Ras-binding site in Raf-Cys is cryptic in full-length Raf-1. Additionally, it provides an explanation for previous findings that specific mutations in the cysteine-rich and kinase domains of D-Raf reverse the loss of function associated with a D-Raf mutation in the Raf-N site that abolishes Ras binding. In light of our observations, we propose a model for the role of Ras-mediated activation of Raf-1 via two distinct Ras binding sequences in Raf-1 (Fig. 3). Binding of the Ras-GTP switch I domain to Raf-N promotes both membrane localization of Raf-1 and exposes residues in Raf-Cys for binding Ras-GTP and possibly other membrane components. Interactions with Raf-Cys then trigger loss of the negative regulatory activity of the Raf-1 NH2 terminus to allow subsequent Ras-independent events to promote Raf-1 kinase activation. The Raf-Cys zinc finger motif also contains binding determinants for phosphatidylserine (15.Ghosh S. Qin Xie W. Quest F.G. Mabrouk G.M. Strum J.C. Bell R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10000-10007Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and 14-3-3 proteins(7.Morrison D. Science. 1994; 266: 56-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Hence, Ras interaction with Raf-Cys may modulate their activities to mediate Raf-1 activation. By analogy with the cysteine-rich domain of protein kinase C(35.Orr J.W. Newton A.C.

Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 4667-4673Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), the Ras-binding site in Raf-Cys may functionally substitute for diacylglycerol, and synergistic binding of Ras and phosphatidylserine may be involved in release of negative regulatory constraints between the NH2 and COOH termini of Raf-1. It is also possible that exposure of the Ras-binding elements in Raf-Cys may require release of 14-3-3 proteins(14.Li S. Janosch P. Tanji M. Rosenfeld G.C. Waymire J.C. Mischak H. Kolch W. Sedivy J.M. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 685-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). In summary, the Ras-Raf-Cys interaction may induce the removal of negative regulatory action in the Raf-1 NH2 terminus and consequently facilitate Raf-1 activation by additional events such as phosphorylation of select residues in Raf-1. We thank G. Pagani, R. Terrell, and M. MacDonald for technical support, A. Cox for performance of tumorigenicity assays and helpful comments, and S. Ghosh and R. C. Bell for supplying the Raf-1 constructs and for helpful discussions."

While the ligands through which dynamin exerts its in vivo effects are unknown, dynamin exhibits in vitro binding to several proteins containing Src homology 3 (SH3) domains, as well as to microtubules and anionic phospholipids, via a basic, proline-rich C-terminal domain. To begin to identify the in vivo binding partners of dynamin, we have examined by immunofluorescence the association of mutant and wild-type forms of dynamin with plasma membranes prepared by sonication of transiently transfected cells. Wild-type dynamin was found almost exclusively in association with clathrin-containing domains. Binding to these regions was abolished by removal of a nine-amino acid sequence within the C-terminal domain encoding a candidate SH3 domain binding site. Binding did not require clathrin and resisted extraction at both high and low ionic strength, consistent with an interaction with an SH3 domain. Surprisingly, we also find that dynamin contains multiple regions involved in binding to non-clathrin-containing domains, including a 13-amino acid sequence directly upstream of the C-terminal domain. These observations suggest that a protein containing an SH3 domain is involved in recruiting dynamin to coated pits and provide the first evidence for a biological role for SH3 domains in dynamin function.

Thus far, no biological role has been established for these in vitro interactions. However, while microtubules are not known to play a role in the early stages of endocytosis, many SH3-containing proteins are thought to transit the early stages of clathrin-mediated endocytosis via interactions with activated receptor tyrosine kinases. To begin to identify the ligands through which dynamin acts in vivo, we have examined the binding of exogenously expressed wild-type and mutant forms of dynamin to plasma membranes in COS-7 cells. We report that dynamin contains multiple regions that target the protein to both clathrin-coated and non-clathrin-coated plasma membrane domains. While the PH domain was neither necessary nor sufficient for plasma membrane binding, binding to clathrin-coated pits depended critically on a nine-amino acid sequence encoding a potential SH3 domain binding site. These findings strongly suggest that dynamin is recruited to coated pits via an SH3-containing protein, perhaps in combination with other signal-transducing proteins. All constructs were generated in the pSVL mammalian expression vector (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). The generation of D-1, N272, N456, N651, C663, N272/C663, S45N, and D208N has been described previously(11.Herskovits J.S. Burgess C.C. Obar R.A. Vallee R.B. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 565-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). The N272/C794 construct was made utilizing unique SmaI sites in pSVL and the cDNA encoding D-1. All other deletion mutants were made by ligating polymerase chain reaction products into the N272 construct using unique restriction sites. All polymerase chain reaction products contained termination codons immediately following the sequence encoding dynamin. COS-7 cells were transfected in 100-mm dishes for 3 h using DEAE-dextran according to a standard protocol(26.Kriegler M. Gene Transfer and Expression. W. H. Freeman and Co., New York1991: 99Google Scholar). 48 h post-transfection the cells were trypsinized, washed, replated onto 18-mm polylysine-coated coverslips in 12-well dishes, and maintained first at 37 and then at 4°C(27.Moore M.S.

The membranes were washed three times with 2 ml of buffer B and either fixed immediately with 3% paraformaldehyde in buffer G (20 mM HEPES (pH 6.8), 100 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 3 mM EGTA) at 4°C or extracted at 23°C for 15 min with the indicated reagent in buffer B, washed three more times in buffer B for 5 min, and fixed as above. Membranes were then processed for double-label immunofluorescence (11.Herskovits J.S. Burgess C.C. Obar R.A. Vallee R.B. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 565-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar) using the X-22 monoclonal antibody to the clathrin heavy chain (gift of Dr. Francis Brodsky) and either the RA or R2 polyclonal antibodies to dynamin(11.Herskovits J.S. Burgess C.C. Obar R.A. Vallee R.B. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 565-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). Transfection efficiencies generally ranged from 5 to 8%. To evaluate the extent to which a dynamin immunofluorescence pattern was overlapped by its corresponding clathrin pattern, a photocopy transparency was made of the latter, from which a same-size negative (black on white) image of the original was printed photographically. A photocopy transparency of this negative image was then laid over the dynamin pattern to determine the percent of the anti-dynamin-staining spots in a region of membrane that also exhibited anti-clathrin immunofluorescence. A minimum of 200 spots was counted for each membrane. Errors represent standard deviations for five membranes. The amount of overlap expected on a random basis (32.2 + 2.2%, n = 5) was determined by performing the same analysis using randomly chosen plasma membrane regions. Membranes prepared from cells expressing wild-type dynamin exhibited bright, punctate immunofluorescence that co-localized with clathrin (Fig. 1, A and B), as has recently been reported in stably transformed HeLa cells (13). Two forms of dynamin mutated in the GTP-binding consensus sequence elements, S45N (Fig. 1, C and D) and D208N (not shown), exhibited similar immunofluorescence patterns. Wild-type dynamin was not extracted from plasma membranes by either GTP, GDP, or GTPγS at 0.5 mM (not shown). To identify the region within dynamin responsible for clathrin co-localization, we prepared membranes from cells expressing several mutant polypeptides lacking the GTPase, PH, and/or C-terminal domains of dynamin (diagrammed in Fig. 4A). The N-terminal truncation mutants N272 and N456 (not shown), which lack the GTPase domain, and N651 (Fig. 1, E and F), which, in addition, lacks the PH domain, exhibited the same immunofluorescence pattern as the wild-type protein, indicating that the C-terminal 201 amino acids contain a signal for binding to coated pits. A complementary polypeptide (C663) lacking 188 amino acids from the dynamin C terminus failed to co-localize with clathrin (Fig. 1, G and H). Nevertheless, this polypeptide did bind to plasma membranes, although at sites that apparently lacked clathrin (see below). Taken together these observations indicated that the C-terminal 201 amino acids of dynamin were both necessary and sufficient for binding to coated pits, while removal of the PH domain had no effect on this behavior. Subdivision of the C663 polypeptide into overlapping smaller fragments (C247, C320, and N272/C663) abolished binding to the non-clathrin-containing sites (≥1600 membranes examined for each construct). Therefore, this latter activity required sequences from more than one region of the C663 polypeptide, which could include elements of the GTPase and/or PH domains. To define more precisely the site in the C-terminal domain required for clathrin co-localization, we examined membranes from cells expressing the N272 polypeptide containing a series of C-terminal deletions (cf. Fig. 4). Constructs N272/C839, N272/C826 (Fig. 2, A and B), N272/C808, and N272/C794 all clearly co-localized with clathrin. Quantitative analysis indicated that 80-90% of the dynamin-positive spots were coincident with clathrin-positive spots (Fig. 2E), the two shorter constructs co-localizing to a slightly lesser degree. Constructs N272/C785, N272/C765, and N272/C746 also exhibited punctate membrane immunofluorescence. However, the immunoreactive spots did not obviously co-localize with clathrin (Fig. 2, C and D), and the extent of overlap was determined to be only 36-40% (Fig. 2E), slightly higher than the value obtained by analysis of randomly selected membranes (32%; see “Materials and Methods”). Thus, the region between amino acids 786 and 794 was essential for clathrin colocalization. This sequence (PAVPPARPG) is closely related to sequences found in other proteins, including 3BP1 and SOS, which bind to SH3 domains (reviewed in (21.Cohen G.B. Ren R. Baltimore D. Cell. 1995; 80: 237-248Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (926) Google Scholar)). Moreover, a peptide spanning this region was found to inhibit dynamin/SH3 interactions(18.Gout I. Dhand R. Hiles I.D. Fry M.J. Panayotou G. Das P. Truong O. Totty N.F. Hsuan J. Booker G.W. Campbell I.D. Waterfield M.D. Cell. 1993; 75: 25-36Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar), and other peptides spanning this region have been found to bind both SH3 domains (18.Gout I. Dhand R. Hiles I.D. Fry M.J. Panayotou G. Das P. Truong O. Totty N.F. Hsuan J. Booker G.W. Campbell I.D. Waterfield M.D. Cell. 1993; 75: 25-36Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar) and SH3 domain-containing proteins (19.Scaife R. Gout I. Waterfield M.D. Margolis R.L. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2574-2582Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Thus, our data are consistent with a role for SH3-containing proteins in the recruitment of dynamin to clathrin-containing domains. To characterize further the interaction between dynamin and clathrin-coated regions, plasma membranes were prepared from cells transfected with a cDNA construct encoding the C-terminal half of dynamin(N456) and extracted using a variety of reagents. The protein resisted extraction with 0.5 M Tris, pH 9.7 (Fig. 3, A and B), as well as 0.5 M KCl or 0.1 M NaHCO3, pH 11.0, all of which extracted clathrin. α-Adaptin has also been reported to be extracted from plasma membranes at high ionic strength(29.Mahaffey D.T. Peeler J.S. Brodsky F.M. Anderson R.G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 16514-16520Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 0.2% Triton X-100 (Fig. 3, C and D) alone extracted neither the N456 polypeptide nor clathrin from the membranes and, in combination with 0.5 M KCl, extracted only clathrin. Thus, the interaction between dynamin and clathrin-coated plasma membrane regions did not appear to require either clathrin coat proteins or anionic phospholipids, suggesting that other plasma membrane components were involved. The N456 polypeptide also resisted extraction in low ionic strength buffers (5 mM Tris, pH 7.0, with or without 0.5 mM EDTA), in which the clathrin immunofluorescence pattern was partially attenuated (not shown). To identify the site in the N272 polypeptide required for binding to the non-clathrin-containing domains, we assayed additional C-terminal truncation mutants for plasma membrane binding (cf.Fig. 4B). Neither the N272/C733 nor the N272/C693 mutants exhibited punctate plasma membrane staining (≥4000 membranes examined from multiple experiments for each construct), although they were clearly detected in intact cells. Thus, the sequence spanning amino acids 733-746 was necessary for binding to the non-clathrin-containing sites. The role of these sites in dynamin function is unclear. However, recent studies in our laboratory have indicated that removal of the sequence between amino acids 733 and 746 also abolishes the inhibition of transferrin uptake seen in cells transfected with some mutant forms of dynamin. Moreover, the proline-rich C terminus, which contains the targeting signal for coated pits, is not required for this phenotype (30.Herskovits J.S. Vallee R.B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5 (abstr.): 76Google Scholar). These observations suggest that the non-clathrin-containing domains play a role in endocytosis of transferrin. Conceivably, these domains could contain components destined for the coated pit, since wild-type dynamin, which contains the sequences needed for binding to both the clathrin-coated and non-clathrin-containing domains, nevertheless colocalized with clathrin to a very high degree (Fig. 1). Our findings indicate that dynamin can bind to both clathrin-coated and non-clathrin-containing regions of the plasma membrane. Our observation that an SH3 domain ligand site is required for binding to coated pits suggests that dynamin and signal-transducing proteins may be coordinately recruited to the endocytic pathway. Further work will be needed to elucidate the identities of the specific ligands through which the interactions of dynamin with the plasma membrane are mediated.

https://openalex.org/W2006904123,"We have developed an in vitro motility system from Ascaris sperm, unique amoeboid cells that use filament arrays composed of major sperm protein (MSP) instead of an actin-based apparatus for locomotion. Addition of ATP to sperm extracts induces formation of fibers approximately 2 microns in diameter. These fibers display the key features of the MSP cytoskeleton in vivo. Each fiber consists of a meshwork of MSP filaments and has at one end a vesicle derived from the plasma membrane at the leading edge of the cell. Fiber growth is due to filament assembly at the vesicle; thus, fiber elongation results in vesicle translocation. This in vitro system demonstrates directly that localized polymerization and bundling of filaments can move membranes and provides a powerful assay for evaluating the molecular mechanism of amoeboid cell motility."

Arachidonic acid, the common precursor for all prostaglandins, is released from membrane phospholipids by both secretory and cytoplasmic forms of phospholipase A2. Free arachidonate is converted to prostaglandin H2, the common precursor to all prostanoids, by prostaglandin synthase. Both mitogen-induced prostaglandin synthesis in fibroblasts and endotoxin-induced prostaglandin synthesis in macrophages require expression of the inducible prostaglandin synthase-2; arachidonate released in these contexts is unavailable to prostaglandin synthase-1 constitutively present in fibroblasts or macrophages.In contrast to the results for fibroblasts and macrophages, prostaglandin synthesis by activated mast cells is mediated by prostaglandin synthase-1.

We now demonstrate that sPLA2 released from activated mast cells can mobilize arachidonate from distal Swiss 3T3 cells. This arachidonate is then used by prostaglandin synthase-1 present in 3T3 cells for prostaglandin synthesis. We thus distinguish two pathways for prostaglandin synthesis: (i) an intracellular pathway by which arachidonate released following ligand stimulation is made available only to prostaglandin synthase-2, and (ii) a transcellular pathway by which sPLA2 of proximal cells mobilizes, in distal cells, arachidonate available to prostaglandin synthase-1.

The prostanoids (prostaglandins, thromboxanes, and prostacyclins) mediate a wide variety of physiological processes, including ovulation, hemostasis, platelet aggregation, kidney water balance, and immune responses(1.DeWitt D.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1083: 121-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar).

Miele L. Pattabiraman N. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1994; 48: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Two forms of prostaglandin synthase, the rate-limiting enzyme in the conversion of free arachidonic acid to prostanoids, also exist. Most cells contain a constitutively-expressed prostaglandin synthase, PGS1, but can also express an inducible form of the enzyme, PGS2, in response to stimulation by appropriate ligands. Ligand-induced PGS2 gene expression has been observed in fibroblasts, macrophages, endothelial cells, epithelial cells, ovarian granulosa cells, neurons, and smooth muscle cells(4.Herschman H.R. Cancer Metastasis Rev. 1994; 13: 241-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). Aspirin and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs exert their antipyretic, analgesic, and anti-inflammatory actions by inhibiting the activity of the prostaglandin synthases(5.Vane J.R. Nature New Biol. 1971; 231: 232-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (7367) Google Scholar, 6.Meade E.A. Smith W.L. DeWitt D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6610-6614Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Experiments utilizing antisense oligonucleotide inhibition demonstrate that both mitogen-stimulated PGE2 production in fibroblasts and endotoxin-stimulated PGE2 production in macrophages require the induced expression and activity of the PGS2 gene and protein, despite the presence of constitutive, enzymatically active PGS1(7.Reddy S.T. Herschman H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15473-15480Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast to the requirement that PGS2 enzyme be synthesized for prostaglandin production following activation by many ligands in fibroblasts and macrophages, PGD2 synthesis occurs rapidly in activated mast cells. Moreover, the rapid PGD2 production in mast cells activated by aggregation of IgE receptors is dependent only on the presence and activity of constitutive PGS1 (8.Murakami M. Matsumoto R. Austen K.F. Arm J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22269-22275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Following activation, mast cells degranulate to release preformed ligands such as histamine and serotonin. In addition, activation releases stored sPLA2 from mast cells(9.Fonteh A.N. Bass D.A. Marshall L.A. Seeds M. Samet J.M. Chilton F.H. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 5438-5446PubMed Google Scholar).

In this report we demonstrate that sPLA2 released from activated MMC-34 mast cells can stimulate PGS1-dependent synthesis of PGE2 in co-cultured Swiss 3T3 cells.

Aminopropyl (NH2) solid-phase silica columns no. 9070 (100 mg/ml) were obtained from Burdick and Jackson (Muskeogon, MI).

Cell cultures were treated with IgE + Anti-IgE, MMC-34 mast cell supernatants, or sPLA2 as described in the figure legends or text. Medium was collected by centrifugation and analyzed for PGD2 and PGE2 levels, using Amersham kits, as described by the manufacturer. In some cases, PGE2 determinations were preformed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay(11.Masferrer J.L. Reddy S.T. Zweifel B. Seibert K. Needleman P. Gilbert R.S. Herschman H.R. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1994; 270: 1340-1344PubMed Google Scholar). Phospholipase activity was determined by a modification of the method of Marshall et al.,(12.Marshall L.A. Bauer J. Sung M.L. Chang J.Y. J. Rheumatol. 1991; 18: 59-65PubMed Google Scholar), which utilizes the acylhydrolysis of [3H] E. coli membranes by PLA2. The reaction mixture (150 μl total volume) contained 25 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM CaCl2 and 0.1 μCi of [3H]arachidonate-labeled E. coli membranes. The assays were incubated at 37°C for 1 h. The reactions were stopped by the addition of 1 ml of tetrahydrofuran. Free arachidonic acid was separated by elution of the sample over aminopropyl solid-phase silica columns with tetrahydrofuran/acetic acid (49:1) and quantitated by liquid scintillation counting(12.Marshall L.A. Bauer J. Sung M.L. Chang J.Y. J. Rheumatol. 1991; 18: 59-65PubMed Google Scholar). Swiss 3T3 cells or MMC-34 mast cells were plated on 12-well culture dishes. Twenty-four hours later, [3H]arachidonic acid (1.5 μCi/ml) was added and cells were cultured for 48 h. Cells were then washed and cultured overnight in medium containing 0.5% serum. Cells were then washed and either treated directly with IgE + anti-IgE, or co-cultured and activated as described in the text. All treatments and co-cultures were in medium containing 0.5% serum. One hour after addition of anti-IgE, medium samples were collected. Lipids were isolated from the medium and analyzed by HPLC and scintillation counting (13.Marcheselli V.L. Scott B.L. Reddy T.S. Bazan N.G. Neuromethods. 1988; 7: 83-110Google Scholar) for accumulation of radioactive PGE2. PGE2 production by Swiss 3T3 cells following stimulation with serum, platelet-derived growth factor, or TPA requires the ligand-induced synthesis of PGS2(7.Reddy S.T. Herschman H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15473-15480Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and follows kinetics consistent with induced PGS2 expression(14.Kujubu D.A. Fletcher B.S. Varnum B.C. Lim R.W. Herschman H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12866-12872Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, mast cell PGD2 production following activation by aggregation of IgE receptors is rapid(8.Murakami M. Matsumoto R. Austen K.F. Arm J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22269-22275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, PGD2 production in activated mast cells is derived, at least in part, from arachidonic acid released in response to sPLA2(9.Fonteh A.N. Bass D.A. Marshall L.A. Seeds M. Samet J.M. Chilton F.H. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 5438-5446PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether other cells show rapid production of prostaglandins in response to sPLA2, we compared the ability of TPA and the sPLA2 from N. naja venom to induce PGE2 production in Swiss 3T3 cells. Although both agents cause substantial PGE2 production, the kinetics differ. sPLA2 treatment causes rapid PGE2 production, which reaches a plateau by the first (10 min) time point measured (Fig. 1). At this time no PGS2 enzyme is detectable in 3T3 cells stimulated with TPA. In contrast, TPA-induced PGE2 accumulation does not significantly increase until 2 h after TPA administration, and is substantially elevated only at later times (Fig. 1). Swiss 3T3 cells express PGS1 constitutively(7.Reddy S.T. Herschman H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15473-15480Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14.Kujubu D.A. Fletcher B.S. Varnum B.C.

Preincubation with aspirin and washing irreversibly inhibits PGS1 activity of 3T3 cells, without inhibiting subsequent TPA-induced, PGS2-dependent PGE2 production(7.Reddy S.T. Herschman H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15473-15480Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Aspirin preincubation and washing prevents all PGE2 production in 3T3 cells in response to sPLA2 (Fig. 2). In contrast, NS-398, a recently described nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that inhibits PGS2 enzyme activity much more effectively than PGS1 activity(15.Futaki N. Takahashi S. Yokoyama M. Arai I. Higuchi S. Otomo S. Prostaglandins. 1994; 47: 55-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (801) Google Scholar), has no effect on sPLA2-induced PGE2 production in Swiss 3T3 cells. These data demonstrate that sPLA2 induces PGE2 production through the action of preexisting, constitutive PGS1 enzyme. Production of PGE2 by TPA-treated cells is abolished by the PGS2-specific inhibitor NS-398 (Fig. 2). In contrast, inactivaton of PGS1 by aspirin pretreatment and washing has no effect on subsequent TPA-induced PGE2 induction in 3T3 cells. We conclude that sPLA2-induced PGE2 synthesis in 3T3 cells is mediated by preexisting PGS1 enzyme, while TPA-induced PGE2 synthesis in 3T3 cells requires synthesis and activity of PGS2 enzyme. Because (i) activated mast cells secrete sPLA2(9.Fonteh A.N. Bass D.A. Marshall L.A. Seeds M. Samet J.M. Chilton F.H. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 5438-5446PubMed Google Scholar), (ii) mast cell prostaglandin synthesis following activation is, at least in part, dependent on sPLA2 production(9.Fonteh A.N. Bass D.A. Marshall L.A. Seeds M. Samet J.M. Chilton F.H. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 5438-5446PubMed Google Scholar), and (iii) sPLA2 can stimulate prostaglandin synthesis in 3T3 cells (Figure 1:, Figure 2:), we thought it possible that activated mast cells might be able to induce transcellular prostaglandin synthesis by release of sPLA2 following activation. Since mast cell-produced PGD2 and fibroblast-produced PGE2 can be distinguished, we tested this proposal by analyzing PGE2 production in mast cell/fibroblast co-cultures. If MMC-34 mast cells are simply co-cultured with 3T3 cells, little PGE2 is present in the medium (Fig. 3, lane 1). If IgE receptors are aggregated on mast cells by treatment with IgE followed by anti-IgE, PGD2 is produced as expected (data not shown), but no production of PGE2 is observed (Fig. 3, lane 2). When Swiss 3T3 cells are treated with IgE followed by anti-IgE, there is also no significant increase in PGE2 levels observed in the medium, since 3T3 cells do not have IgE receptors (Fig. 3, lane 3). However, substantial production of PGE2 is observed in MMC-34 mast cell/Swiss 3T3 co-cultures following addition of IgE + anti-IgE (Fig. 3, lane 4). The PGE2 present in these co-cultures after stimulation with IgE + anti-IgE must come from the 3T3 cells, since activation of mast cells alone by IgE + anti-IgE does not produce PGE2. Activation-induced PGE2 production in the co-cultures must, therefore, be due to a mast cell-mediated effect on the 3T3 cells. Medium from activated mast cells can also stimulate PGE2 production when applied to 3T3 cells (Fig. 3, lane 5). We conclude that a secreted intermediate from activated mast cells mediates PGE2 production in co-cultured Swiss 3T3 cells. As expected(9.Fonteh A.N. Bass D.A. Marshall L.A. Seeds M. Samet J.M. Chilton F.H. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 5438-5446PubMed Google Scholar), supernatants from MMC-34 mast cells activated by exposure to IgE + Anti-IgE contain substantially elevated levels of PLA2 enzyme activity, when compared to supernatants from unactivated cells (Fig. 4, left panel, lanes 1 and 2). Once again, the supernatant from activated mast cells is able to induce PGE2 production from 3T3 cells (Fig. 4, right panel, lanes 1 and 2). It seems likely that the sPLA2 released following activation of mast cells is responsible for the production of PGE2 in the mast cell/fibroblast co-cultures. We used mAb F10, a monoclonal antibody directed against recombinant sPLA2(9.Fonteh A.N. Bass D.A. Marshall L.A. Seeds M. Samet J.M. Chilton F.H. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 5438-5446PubMed Google Scholar), and SB 203347, a recently described inhibitor of sPLA2 enzyme activity(16.Marshall, L. A., Hall, R. H., Winkler, J. D., Badger, A., Bolognese, B., Roshak, A., Louis-Flamberg, P., Sung, C-M., Chabot-Fletcher, M., Adams, J. L., Mayer, R. J. (1995) J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther., in pressGoogle Scholar), to determine whether the sPLA2 released by activated MMC-34 mast cells is responsible for PGE2 production by 3T3 cells in the mast cell/fibroblast co-cultures. Recombinant sPLA2 (rPLA2), like the N. naja sPLA2 and the supernatants from activated mast cells, can induce PGE2 production in 3T3 cells (Fig. 5). Both mAb F10 and SB 203347 inhibit PGE2 induction in 3T3 cells in response to rPLA2 treatment (Fig. 5). mAb F10 and SB 203347 block 72% and 74% of the phospholipase activity of the rPLA2 protein used in the experiment illustrated in Fig. 5(data not shown). The amount of rPLA2 activity (150 pmol of [3H]arachidonic acid released/min/ml) used in this experiment was chosen to resemble that found in the supernatants of activated MMC-34 mast cells (Fig. 4). The PLA2 enzymatic activity released into MMC 34 mast cell supernatants following IgE + Anti-IgE activation can be neutralized by mAb F10, and inhibited by SB 203347 (Fig. 4, left panel). In contrast, a control mAb has no effect on PLA2 activity in activated mast cell supernatants. Similarly, addition of either the anti-rPLA2 mAb F10 or the sPLA2 inhibitor SB 203347 block the ability of supernatants from activated MMC 34 mast cells to induce PGE2 production by 3T3 cells (Fig. 4, right panel). These data demonstrate that the sPLA2 released by mast cells following activation is essential for transcellular prostaglandin synthesis in 3T3 cells. Activation of mast cells leads to release of arachidonic acid(9.Fonteh A.N. Bass D.A. Marshall L.A. Seeds M. Samet J.M. Chilton F.H. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 5438-5446PubMed Google Scholar), as well as sPLA2. Since exogenous arachidonic acid can be used by PGS1 to produce PGE2 in Swiss 3T3 cells (7.Reddy S.T. Herschman H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15473-15480Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), it is possible that the PGE2 produced in MMC-34/3T3 co-cultures following activation by IgE + anti-IgE could, at least in part, be synthesized by PGS1 in 3T3 cells from arachidonic acid released by the activated mast cells. However, supernatants from mast cells treated with either mAb F10 or SB 203347, which neuteralize and/or inhibit PLA2 activity after mast cell activation, should contain arachidonic acid released from the mast cells prior to the addition of the inhibitors. These neuteralized/inhibited supernatants from activated mast cells do not elicit PGE2 production in 3T3 cells (Fig. 4), suggesting that arachidonic acid from activated mast cells does not serve as substrate for transcellular prostaglandin synthesis by fibroblasts. In the co-cultures, and in in vivo contexts where transcellular prostaglandin synthesis may be occurring as a result of release of PLA2 from proximal cells, it is likely that arachidonic acid released from the proximal cell is sequestered by plasma proteins such as albumin, and is not available as substrate for PGS in the distal cell. To investigate more extensively the source of arachidonic acid substrate in the distal 3T3 cells engaged in transcellular prostaglandin production, we labeled the membranes of either proximal MMC-34 mast cells or distal Swiss 3T3 cells with [3H]arachidonic acid, and examined radioactive PGE2 synthesis in [IgE + anti-IgE]-treated cultures of each cell type individually, and in co-cultures. No radioactive PGE2 is produced following stimulation of [3H]arachidonic acid-labeled 3T3 cells (Fig. 6). Although radioactive arachidonate is released by the medium change that accompanied this treatment (eluting from the chromatogram at a later time; data not shown), this arachidonate cannot be converted to PGE2, because no PGS2 is present(7.Reddy S.T. Herschman H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15473-15480Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). No radioactive PGE2 is produced following activation of [3H]arachidonic acid-labeled MMC-34 mast cells, since mast cells make PGD2, but not PGE2. When co-cultures of MMC-34 mast cells and [3H]arachidonic acid-labeled Swiss 3T3 cells are stimulated with IgE + anti-IgE, synthesis of radioactive PGE2 is observed. In contrast, when co-cultures containing [3H]arachidonate-labeled MMC-34 cells and unlabeled Swiss 3T3 cells are treated with IgE + anti-IgE, no radioactive PGE2 is produced. We conclude (i) that arachidonic acid released from activated mast cells in co-culture is not available as substrate for 3T3 cells (presumably because of sequestration by plasma proteins) and (ii) that arachidonic acid present in membranes of 3T3 cells is released by mast cell sPLA2 following activation, and is utilized by PGS1 present in the 3T3 cells for PGE2 production. We suggest that there are two distinct routes of prostanoid biosynthesis in 3T3 fibroblasts (Fig. 7). For the first route, ligand-activated intracellular phospholipase(s) releases arachidonic acid that is not available to PGS1; this arachidonate must be converted to PGH2 by PGS2 enzyme, following ligand-activated PGS2 gene expression(7.Reddy S.T. Herschman H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15473-15480Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Activation of an intracellular, cytoplasmic PLA2 is likely to be required for this pathway. The second, transcellular route of prostanoid synthesis occurs via release of sPLA2 by proximal cells. This sPLA2 enzyme can then act as a paracrine mediator of arachidonate release in distal 3T3 cells, leading to transcellular prostaglandin production by constitutive PGS1. The proposed alternative pathways of prostaglandin synthesis are illustrated in Fig. 7. The 14-kilodalton form of PLA2 remains in the cytoplasm and/or is secreted following cellular activation(3.Mukherjee A.B. Miele L. Pattabiraman N. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1994; 48: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). In contrast, following ligand stimulation, the 85-kilodalton isoform of PLA2 becomes phosphorylated, and then associates with cell membranes(3.Mukherjee A.B. Miele L. Pattabiraman N. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1994; 48: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Recent studies have suggested that, following ligand stimulation, the 85-kilodalton PLA2 molecule becomes associated with the nuclear membrane(17.Glover S. Bayburt T. Jonas M. Chi E. Gelb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15359-15367Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). Until recently, both PGS1 and PGS2 enzymes were thought to be associated with the endoplasmic reticulum (18.Kujubu D.A. Reddy S.T. Fletcher B.S. Herschman H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5425-5430Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19.Regier M.K. De Witt D.L. Schindler M.S. Smith W.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 301: 439-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). However, confocal immunofluorescent microscopy studies suggest that PGS2, unlike PGS1, associates with the nuclear membrane (20.Morita I. Schindler M. Regier M.K. Otto J.C. Hori T. De Witt D. Smith W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10902-10908Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar). The recent demonstrations that one isoform of PLA2 (85-kilodalton cPLA2) and one isoform of PGS (PGS2) can preferentially associate with the nuclear membrane suggests a potential spatial explanation for the distinct routes of prostaglandin production observed in fibroblasts. Inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis, either by interfering with phospholipase-mediated release of membrane-bound arachidonic acid or by interfering with prostaglandin synthase-mediated conversion of free arachidonate to PGH2, is a major pharmacologic goal. With the discovery of alternative PLA2 and prostaglandin synthase isoforms, new targets for specific pharmacologic intervention of prostaglandin synthesis have emerged. Demonstration that PGS2 is induced in inflammatory responses (reviewed in (4.Herschman H.R. Cancer Metastasis Rev. 1994; 13: 241-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar)) and that PGS1 and PGS2 have restricted pools of precursor arachidonate (7.Reddy S.T. Herschman H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15473-15480Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8.Murakami M. Matsumoto R. Austen K.F. Arm J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22269-22275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) has increased interest in identifying isoform-specific inhibitors of prostaglandin synthase and phospholipase A2 as therapeutic agents. The goal of identifying PGS2-specific inhibitors is to produce NSAIDs without ulcerogenic or nephrotoxic side effects. A number of lead NSAIDs that are substantially more effective in inhibiting PGS2 activity relative to PGS1 have now been described(21.Vane J.R. Botting R.M. Inflammation Res. 1995; 44: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (820) Google Scholar). Our data demonstrating that both a transcellular route of prostaglandin synthesis and an intracellular route of prostaglandin synthesis exist, and utilize alternative PGS and PLA2 isoforms, suggests that combinatorial use of specific phospholipase and prostaglandin synthase inhibitors may be necessary to achieve suppression of prostaglandin production in cases where substantial sPLA2 production occurs. How general might transcellular prostanoid production by the proximal sPLA2/distal PGS1 pathway be? The first considerations are (i) the range of cells that produce and secrete sPLA2, and (ii) the range of cells that respond to sPLA2 administration by PGS1-mediated prostanoid production. sPLA2 is present in inflammatory fluids, e.g. synovial fluid, and in inflammatory tissue exudates(22.Mayer R. Marshall L.A. FASEB J. 1993; 7: 339-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). Activated mast cells(9.Fonteh A.N. Bass D.A. Marshall L.A. Seeds M. Samet J.M. Chilton F.H. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 5438-5446PubMed Google Scholar), platelets (23.Kramer R.M. Hession C. Johansen B. Hayes G. McGray P. Chow E.P. Tizard R. Pepinsky R.B. J. Biol.

Cytokine-induced sPLA2 synthesis and release occurs in astrocytes (25.Oka S. Arita H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9956-9960Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and mesangial cells(26.Nakazato Y. Simonson M.S. Herman W.H. Konieczkowski M. Sedor J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14119-14127Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). sPLA2 induction is also part of the septic shock and liver acute phase responses(22.Mayer R. Marshall L.A. FASEB J. 1993; 7: 339-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). With regard to distal cell responsiveness to sPLA2, antisense sPLA2 oligonucleotides reduce both endotoxin-stimulated arachidonic acid release and prostaglandin synthesis in P388D1 macrophage-like cells (27.Balsinde J. Barbour S.E. Bianco I.D. Dennis E.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11060-11064Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Extracellular sPLA2 has also been implicated in prostaglandin production in mesangial cells (28.Pfeilschifter J. Schalkwijk C. Briner V.A. van den Bosch H. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 2516-25123Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar) and endothelial cells(29.Murakami M. Kudo I. Inoue K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 839-844Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Co-cultivation of alveolar epithelial cells and macrophages labeled respectively with [14C]arachidonate and [3H]arachidonate has demonstrated that proximal macrophages can serve as a source of substrate arachidonic acid for prostaglandin synthesis by distal epithelial cells(30.Peters-Golden M. Feyssa A. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: L438-L447Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, we find that the arachidonic acid produced by activated mast cells, the proximal cells in our co-cultures that engage in transcellular prostaglandin synthesis, is not available to the distal 3T3 cell prostaglandin synthase. Although sPLA2 is postulated to at least in part mediate antigen-induced prostaglandin synthesis in mast cells (8.Murakami M. Matsumoto R. Austen K.F. Arm J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22269-22275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and endotoxin-induced prostaglandin synthesis in P388D1 macrophage-like cells (27.Balsinde J. Barbour S.E. Bianco I.D. Dennis E.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11060-11064Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) in an autocrine fashion, evidence for sPLA2 as a transcellular mediator of prostaglandin synthesis has not previously been described. Although previous reports of transcellular prostanoid synthesis are rare, there is a substantial literature demonstrating transcellular production of the other class of eicosanoids, the leukotrienes. LTA4, the product of 5′-lipoxygenase, can be transformed to LTB4 by LTA4 hydrolase or conjugated to glutathione by LTC4 synthase. 5′-Lipoxygenase is restricted to myeloid cells(31.Lindgren J.A. Edenius C. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1993; 14: 351-354Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). One might, therefore, expect that these are the only cells that would produce leukotrienes. However, many cell types unable to express 5′-lipoxygenase nevertheless produce LTB4. This occurs because (i) such cells express LTA4 hydrolase and (ii) LTA4 can be released from proximal myeloid cells and used as substrate by LTA4 hydrolase present in distal cells. Erythrocytes(32.McGee J.E. Fitzpatrick F.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 1349-1353Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), endothelial cells(33.Claesson H.E. Haeggstrom J. Eur. J.

LTC4 synthase has been demonstrated in platelets, endothelial cells, and epidermal cells, in addition to myeloid cells.

https://openalex.org/W1607595440,"Treatment of the mouse fibrosarcoma cell line L929 with tumor necrosis factor (TNF) induces necrotic cell death. A crucial step in the cytotoxic action mechanism of TNF involves perturbation of mitochondrial functions leading to the formation of reactive oxygen intermediates (ROI). L929 cells have energy requirements adapted to a high proliferation rate. Glutamine (Gln) is utilized as a major energy source and drives mitochondrial ATP formation, while glucose is mainly converted to lactate through glycolysis. We investigated the role of the bioenergetic pathways involved in substrate utilization on the cytotoxic action of TNF and established a link between Gln oxidation and TNF-induced mitochondrial distress. Omission of Gln from the medium desensitizes the cells to TNF cytotoxicity, while the lack of glucose in the medium does not alter the TNF response. Sudden depletion of Gln from the culture medium results in a sharp decline in mitochondrial respiration in the cells, which might explain the decreased TNF responsiveness. However, when L929 cells are adapted to long term growth under conditions without Gln, these so-called L929/Gln- cells have restored respiration, but they still display a decreased sensitivity to TNF cytotoxicity. Thus the TNF responsiveness of L929 cells depends on bioenergetic reactions that are specifically involved in the oxidation of Gln. This is further confirmed by the desensitizing effect of specific inhibitors of these Gln-linked enzyme reactions on TNF cytotoxicity in the parental cells, but not in the L929/Gln- cells. Analysis of the induction of mitochondrial ROI formation by TNF in parental and L929/Gln- cells suggests that the effect of Gln on the sensitivity to TNF cytotoxicity involves a mechanism that renders the mitochondria more susceptible to TNF-induced mediators, resulting in enhanced ROI production and accelerated cytotoxicity."

FEBS Lett. 1993; 318: 83-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). kilobase(s) interleukin activating protein-1 fetal calf serum Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium digoxigenin piperazine-N,N′-bis(2-ethanesulfonic acid). The in vivo expression patterns of the two T1 transcripts differ drastically. The short mRNA has been found in experimental Ha-ras-induced murine mammary tumors, in the developing mammary gland 3-4 weeks after birth (10.Rossler U. Andres A.C. Reichmann E. Schmahl W. Werenskiold A.K. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 609-617PubMed Google Scholar) as well as in embryonic skin, retina, and bone(11.Rossler U. Thomassen E. Hultner L. Baier S. Danescu J. Werenskiold A.K. Dev. Biol. 1995; 168: 86-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Expression of the long transcript is restricted to distinct cells of the hematopoietic organs (embryonic liver, spleen, bone marrow) (11.Rossler U. Thomassen E. Hultner L. Baier S. Danescu J. Werenskiold A.K. Dev. Biol. 1995; 168: 86-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) and to the lung (12.Bergers G. Reikerstorfer A. Braselmann S. Graninger P. Busslinger M. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1176-1188Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar) throughout ontogenesis. Despite their similarity to the IL-1 receptor, the T1 proteins neither bind IL-1α nor IL-1β(11.Rossler U. Thomassen E. Hultner L. Baier S. Danescu J. Werenskiold A.K. Dev. Biol. 1995; 168: 86-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), suggesting that the large protein is a novel orphan receptor predominantly expressed in a subset of hematopoietic cells. Growth factor-induced T1 gene expression in fibroblasts is mediated by AP-1(4.Kalousek M.B. Trub T. Schuermann M. Klemenz R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6866-6873Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13.Trub T. Kalousek M.B. Frohli E. Klemenz R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1072: 129-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (3279) Google Scholar). A 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate-responsive element located within the T1 enhancer at position −3.6 kb is essential for gene induction(13.Trub T. Kalousek M.B. Frohli E. Klemenz R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3896-3900Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Furthermore, expression of the immediate early transcription factors c-Fos and FosB resulted in the accumulation of T1 mRNA(4.Kalousek M.B. Trub T. Schuermann M. Klemenz R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6866-6873Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Likewise, the rat T1 homologue fit-1 was identified as a c-Fos-responsive gene in fibroblasts(15.Superti-Furga G. Bergers G. Picard D. Busslinger M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 5114-5118Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Sequence analysis of cDNA clones obtained from T1 mRNA in hematopoietic cells and fibroblasts revealed different transcription initiation sites in these two cell types. Here we demonstrate that the T1 gene is transcribed from two promoters which are 10.5 kb apart. Promoter usage is strictly tissue-specific, the distal and proximal promoters being used exclusively in hematopoietic cells and fibroblasts, respectively. NFR-2 is a cell clone of NIH 3T3 cells transfected with the Ha-ras (EJ) oncogene(16.Aoyama A. Frohli E. Schafer R. Klemenz R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1824-1835Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). NIH 3T3 and NFR-2 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS), penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml). To arrest cell growth, the cells were incubated for 24 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.5% FCS. This medium was replaced with fresh Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% FCS to stimulate entry into the cell cycle. Anisomycin (Fluka, Biochemica) was added at 200 ng/ml to NFR-2 cells for 6 h. The cell clones 15 and R56 (17.Nair A.P. Hirsch H.H. Moroni C. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 1963-1972PubMed Google Scholar) are derivatives of the strictly IL-3-dependent mastocyte cell line PB-3c, which was isolated from mouse bone marrow (18.Ball P.E. Conroy M.C. Heusser C.H. Davis J.M. Conscience J.F. Differentiation. 1983; 24: 74-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). R56V is an IL-3-dependent, ZIP-v-ras-neomycin(19.Schwartz R.C. Stanton L.W. Riley S.C. Marcu K.B. Witte O.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 3221-3231Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) -infected derivative of R56 and clone 15V-T2 is a ZIP-v-ras-neomycin-transduced, IL-3-independent tumor cell line(20.Hirsch H.H. Nair A.P. Moroni C. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 178: 403-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). All mast cells were maintained in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium (IMDM) supplemented with 10% FCS, penicillin (100 units/ml), streptomycin (100 μg/ml), glutamine (292 μg/ml) (supplemented IMDM), and 2% conditioned medium from X63-mIL-3 cells. X63-mIL-3 is a myeloma cell line transfected with an IL-3 expression plasmid(21.Karasuyama H. Melchers F. Eur. J. Immunol. 1988; 18: 97-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (1081) Google Scholar). These cells were grown in supplemented IMDM and neomycin (1 mg/ml) for 4 days, washed twice with supplemented IMDM, freshly plated at a density of 104 cells/ml, and cultured in supplemented IMDM for 4 days. The cells were centrifuged, and IL-3-conditioned medium was harvested, filtered, and stored at −20°C. Bone marrow was obtained from the femur of B6 × BALB/c mice and maintained under the same conditions as the established mast cells. Suspension cells were transferred periodically to fresh culture dishes to enrich for mast cells. After 4 weeks in culture, over 95% of the suspension cells were mast cells, as assessed by staining either with toluidine blue or alcian blue/safranin(22.Ishizaka T. Okudaira H. Mauser L.E.

Total RNA was isolated by the acid guanidinium thiocyanate-phenol-chloroform extraction method described by Chomczynski and Sacchi(24.Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63232) Google Scholar). We used the PolyATract(™) mRNA isolation system (Promega) to enrich for mRNA. Five or ten micrograms of total RNA and 2.5 μg of poly(A) mRNA were denatured by glyoxylation, separated on 1% agarose gels(25.McMaster G.K. Carmichael G.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 4835-4838Crossref PubMed Scopus (1727) Google Scholar), transferred onto nylon membranes (GeneScreen Plus; DuPont-NEN) and UV cross-linked (UV stratalinker 1800; Stratagene). Hybridization was performed either with DNA fragments labeled with [α-α-32P]dCTP (3000 Ci/mmol; Amersham Corp.) according to Feinberg and Vogelstein(26.Feinberg A.P. Vogelstein B. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 132: 6-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (16651) Google Scholar, 27.Feinberg A.P. Vogelstein B. Anal.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 5843-5851Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar) in 50% formamide, 5 × SSC, 0.1% N-lauroylsarcosine, 0.02% SDS, 20 mM maleic acid, pH 7.5, 30 mM NaCl, and 2% blocking reagent. DIG-labeled RNA was produced using the DIG RNA labeling kit (Boehringer Mannheim) and the plasmid pMV7TORF(4.Kalousek M.B. Trub T. Schuermann M. Klemenz R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6866-6873Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), linearized with SalI, as the template. The resulting 1-kb RNA spans the whole small T1 open reading frame. DIG-labeled RNA was detected using an anti-DIG antibody coupled to alkaline phosphatase followed by the enzymatic reaction with the substrate Lumigen(™) PPD (DIG luminescent detection kit; Boehringer Mannheim). The radioactively labeled probes were the following: a 1.15-kb HindIII/BamHI fragment from the plasmid pETRI 17 (13.Trub T. Kalousek M.B. Frohli E. Klemenz R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3896-3900Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) spanning exon 2, a 0.95-kb BamHI/HindIII fragment from the same plasmid, spanning the proximal exon 1, and a 0.6-kb EcoRI fragment from the plasmid pETH(13.Trub T. Kalousek M.B. Frohli E. Klemenz R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3896-3900Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), containing the distal exon 1. Genomic and plasmid DNA were digested with restriction enzymes, the fragments separated on 1% agarose gels, transferred to nylon membranes, and UV cross-linked. The membranes were either hybridized with DNA fragments labeled with [α-α-32P]dCTP according to Feinberg and Vogelstein (26.Feinberg A.P. Vogelstein B. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 132: 6-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (16651) Google Scholar, 27.Feinberg A.P. Vogelstein B. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 137: 266-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (5190) Google Scholar) in 5 × SSC, 5 × Denhardt's solution, 1% SDS, and 100 μg/ml denatured carrier DNA or to the 5′-end-labeled oligonucleotide TG1d (ATTAGCCAGAGGTCCTAGCCATCTTTATT) in 10% dextran sulfate, 5 × SSC, 10 × Denhardt's, 7% SDS, 20 mM NaHPO4 (pH 7.0), and 100 μg/ml denatured carrier DNA. For end labeling, 50 ng of the oligonucleotide was incubated in 25 μl of 70 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10 mM MgCl2, 5 mM dithiothreitol, 0.1 mM spermidine, 70 μCi of [α-32P] ATP (5000 Ci/mmol; Amersham Corp.), and 12.5 units T4 polynucleotide kinase (Fermentas) at 37°C for 45 min. The reaction was stopped by heating at 75°C for 10 min and unincorporated [α-32P]ATP removed on a Nick(™) column (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). The following DNA probes were used for hybridization: the 0.6-kb EcoRI fragment from the plasmid pETH containing the distal exon 1 sequence and the 0.85-kb SacI/SphI fragment from the plasmid pETRI 17. The 0.6-kb EcoRI fragment of plasmid pETH was subcloned into pBluescript KS+ (Stratagene), and the nucleotide sequence was determined by the dideoxynucleoside triphosphate-chain termination reaction(29.Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52769) Google Scholar). For primer extension analysis, 1-2 × 105 cpm of end-labeled oligonucleotides TG1p (GGGCTGGAGAGAATAAGCTCAGAGCCGTGAGGGC) or TG2 (GCTCTCTGAGGTAGGGTCCAGAAGAGAAATCAC) (purified on 7 M urea, 13% polyacrylamide gels (30.Sanger F. Coulson A.R. FEBS Lett. 1978; 87: 107-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (946) Google Scholar) prior to labeling) were mixed with 5-30 μg of total RNA, ethanol-precipitated, and resuspended in 30 μl of 50% formamide, 400 mM NaCl, 10 mM PIPES (pH 6.4), and 1 mM EDTA. Annealing was performed by incubation at 80°C for 3 min followed by slow cooling to room temperature. The nucleic acids were precipitated with isopropanol and primer extension reactions were carried out in 20 μl of 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), 75 mM KCl, 3 mM MgCl2, 5 mM dithiothreitol, 1 μg of actinomycin D, 125 μM of each deoxynucleoside triphosphate, 20 units of RNase Inhibitor (Boehringer Mannheim), and 300 units of RNase H- Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (SuperScript(™); Life Technologies, Inc.) at 39°C for 1 h. For dideoxy chain termination primer extension reactions(29.Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52769) Google Scholar), the conditions used were identical to the above with the following changes: the concentration of each of the three driver dNTPs (not in competition with the ddNTP) was 10 μM, the concentration of the dNTP which was competed for by the corresponding ddNTP was 6 μM, ddATP was 25 μM, ddCTP was 20 μM, ddGTP was 10 μM, and ddTTP was 30 μM. The reactions were stopped by the addition of EDTA to a final concentration of 25 mM, and the RNA was degraded with 5 μg of RNase A at 37°C for 30 min. After phenol/chloroform extraction of the mixture and subsequent ethanol precipitation the primer extension products were analyzed on 7 M urea, 9% polyacrylamide sequencing gels (30.Sanger F. Coulson A.R. FEBS Lett. 1978; 87: 107-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (946) Google Scholar). The sequences of cDNA clones derived from mast cells and fibroblasts diverge upstream of the 5′ end of exon 2 (data not shown). The whole genomic T1 DNA has been sequenced up to the SacI site at position −3.987(13.Trub T. Kalousek M.B. Frohli E. Klemenz R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3896-3900Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 31.Tominaga S. Jenkins N.A. Gilbert D.J. Copeland N.G. Tetsuka T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1090: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). No sequence corresponding to the 5′ end of the mast cell-specific T1 cDNA was found within this region. Therefore the T1 transcription start site in mast cells must be located further upstream. In order to identify this start site, we first determined the genomic organization upstream of the end point of the published sequence (Fig. 1A). DNA of plasmid pETH (Fig. 1A) as well as genomic DNA of NIH 3T3 cells and of primary mast cells were subjected to Southern blot analysis to verify that the organization of the recombinant DNA corresponds to the one of the genomic DNA. The restriction fragment patterns of the different DNAs, obtained by hybridization with the radioactively labeled 0.85-kb SacI/SphI fragment (Fig. 1B), were identical, indicating that no DNA rearrangement had occurred during cloning. This result was confirmed using the 0.6-kb EcoRI fragment as a probe (data not shown). Next we localized the mast cell-specific sequence by Southern blot hybridization utilizing as a probe the oligonucleotide TG1d which represents part of the extra sequence present at the 5′ end of mast cell but not of fibroblast T1 mRNA. The hybridization pattern indicated that the novel sequence is limited to the 0.6-kb EcoRI fragment of the plasmid pETH located approximately 10.5 kb upstream of the previously described transcription start site (Fig. 2A). Sequence analysis of this restriction fragment revealed that the entire extra 5′ sequence of the mast cell-specific T1 transcript is colinear with genomic DNA, thus representing an alternative first exon within this 0.6-kb EcoRI fragment (Fig. 2B). In order to accurately map the transcription initiation site, we performed primer extension analysis (Fig. 2C). A major and a minor extension product were obtained. Reactions in the presence of dideoxynucleoside triphosphates allowed the exact positioning of the transcription start site. The 5′ ends determined by primer extension and by cDNA cloning coincide precisely. The T1 gene is transcribed into a major 2.7-kb and a minor 5-kb mRNA in fibroblasts and almost exclusively into the longer 5-kb mRNA in mast cells. Initiation of transcription at the distal and proximal exon 1 could either be cell type-specific or specific for the long and the short transcript as has been suggested for the fit-1 gene, the rat homologue of T1(12.Bergers G. Reikerstorfer A. Braselmann S. Graninger P. Busslinger M. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1176-1188Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). Northern blot analyses of RNA extracted from primary and established mast cells, fibroblasts, and adherent primary bone marrow cells were performed to address this question (Fig. 3). The probes used for hybridization recognized either the T1 open reading frame, the exon 2, or the proximal or distal exon 1. As expected, serum-stimulated fibroblasts mainly expressed the short 2.7-kb mRNA, whereas the 5-kb transcript accumulated predominantly in mast cells and, to a much lower extent, in primary adherent bone marrow cells. The T1 gene has previously been identified as a delayed early serum response gene based on the observation that ongoing protein synthesis is a prerequisite for its stimulation. However, in certain cell lines such as NIH 3T3 fibroblasts, T1 induction is possible in the presence of the protein synthesis inhibitors cycloheximide and anisomycin (32.Yanagisawa K. Tsukamoto T. Takagi T. Tominaga S. FEBS Lett. 1992; 302: 51-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar).3 We even observed that anisomycin on its own led to a very substantial accumulation of T1 mRNA (data not shown). We found particularly high levels of the long 5-kb T1 transcript in the Ha-ras (EJ)-transformed NIH 3T3 cell line NFR-2(33.Aoyama A. Steiger R.H. Frohli E. Schafer R. von D.A. Wiestler O.D. Klemenz R. Int. J. Cancer. 1993; 55: 760-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Therefore, analysis of T1 transcription initiation in this cell line allowed us to distinguish between transcript-specific versus tissue-specific promoter usage. The Northern blot analyses shown in Fig. 3 demonstrate that all T1 transcripts contain sequences downstream of the exon 1/exon 2 boundary (top two panels), whereas hybridization to the distal and proximal exon 1-specific probes occurred only with RNA derived from mast cells and fibroblasts, respectively, independent of the transcript size. Hybridization with the probe which recognizes the proximal exon 1 is rather inefficient probably due to the small size of this exon (Fig. 3, third panel). We therefore analyzed poly(A)-enriched RNA to detect the 5-kb T1 transcript in fibroblasts (Fig. 3, right panel). Primer extension experiments were performed to confirm these results at the level of transcription initiation. The primers used in these experiments as well as the expected elongation products are depicted in Fig. 4A. The oligonucleotide TG2, which is complementary to the 5′ region of exon 2, was extended on RNA derived from NFR-2 cells (Fig. 4B, lane 1), NIH 3T3 cells (Fig. 4B, lane 2), and mast cells (Fig. 4B, lane 3). The extension product indicative for transcriptional initiation at the proximal promoter was obtained with RNA from the two fibroblast cell lines. In contrast, primer extension on mast cell-derived RNA gave rise to the two extension products characteristic for initiation at the distal promoter (Fig. 4B). Thus, transcription initiation seems to be strictly cell type-specific. This implies that synthesis of the 5-kb T1 mRNA starts at the distal (Fig. 4B, lane 3) as well as the proximal (Fig. 4B, lane 1) promoter. However, one could argue that the long T1 transcript in fibroblasts is initiated at the distal promoter but that the corresponding extension product could not be detected due to its low abundance. To disprove this argument, we performed a primer extension experiment with a mixture of RNA derived from serum-stimulated NIH 3T3 fibroblasts and from mast cells. Northern blot analysis demonstrated that the ratio of the 2.7-kb to the 5-kb T1 transcript in this mixture is approximately the same as in anisomycin-treated NFR-2 cells (Fig. 4C, compare lanes 1 and 4). We obtained extension products indicative of transcription initiation at the proximal and distal promoter (Fig. 4B, lane 4). Even a mixture with a 4-fold reduced amount of mast cell RNA gave rise to easily detectable primer extension products derived from the distal exon 1 (data not shown). Hence, if the long T1 mRNA in NFR-2 cells were initiated at the distal promoter, we should have detected it by primer extension (Fig. 4B, lane 1). Therefore, we conclude that synthesis of the large majority of both T1 transcripts in NFR-2 fibroblasts is started at the proximal exon 1 and that transcript size is independent of the promoter used. Furthermore, primer extension experiments with the oligonucleotide TG1p, which anneals to the proximal exon 1, yielded a product with RNA from fibroblasts but not from mast cells (Fig. 4D). This confirms that T1 gene transcription in mast cells is exclusively initiated at the distal promoter. In this report we have demonstrated that the synthesis of T1 mRNA starts at different promoters in fibroblasts and in mast cells. The two alternative first exons are 10.5 kb apart, and both are spliced to exon 2 where translation starts. Alternative 3′ processing gives rise to a short 2.7-kb and a long 5-kb mRNA that encode a secreted and a putative trans-membrane protein, respectively. In fibroblasts the short transcript predominates, but small amounts of the long mRNA are always observed. Under certain conditions, such as treatment with anisomycin, substantial amounts of the long T1 mRNA are synthesized in fibroblasts, particularly in ras-transformed NIH 3T3 cells. This finding allowed us to demonstrate that all T1 transcripts are initiated at the proximal promoter in fibroblasts, irrespective of their processing mode (Fig. 4, B and C). This is in line with the observation that the two T1 transcripts accumulate in parallel under all inducing conditions in fibroblasts and thus are apparently controlled by the same transcriptional regulatory elements. The large T1 mRNA predominates in mast cells, but substantial amounts of the 2.7-kb T1 transcript could be observed under certain conditions such as treatment with Ca2+ ionophores (data not shown). The synthesis of both T1 mRNAs is initiated at the distal promoter in mast cells. Expression of fit-1, the rat homologous gene of T1, is initiated at two tissue-specific promoters as well, the transcription start sites being 14 kb apart(12.Bergers G. Reikerstorfer A. Braselmann S. Graninger P. Busslinger M. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1176-1188Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). The model has been put forward that transcription initiation is tightly coupled to 3′ processing. Accordingly, whenever transcription starts at the distal promoter, the long mRNA is produced, whereas initiation at the proximal promoter instructs the transcription machinery to terminate in exon 8, giving rise to the short transcript. However, this model is rendered unlikely by our finding that substantial amounts of the long T1 mRNA are observed in fibroblasts under some conditions and that these transcripts are exclusively initiated at the proximal promoter. Rather, we suggest that transcription initiation and 3′ processing (poly(A) selection) are two independent tissue-specific events. Sequence analysis of the genomic DNA around the mast cell-specific first exon revealed the presence of two GATA elements and one putative SP1 binding site (Fig. 2B). The GATA consensus motif (T/A)GATA(A/G) is the recognition site of the GATA transcription factor family of which six members have so far been described. The patterns of both sequence preferences for DNA binding and expression in tissues as well as cell lines are overlapping, but distinct for these zinc finger proteins. Thus, the GATA transcription factors might exert differential gene regulation by distinct tissue distribution, selective binding to DNA target sequences or by different interactions with other nuclear proteins. Among the GATA factors, expression of GATA-1(34.Martin D.I. Zon L.I. Mutter G. Orkin S.H. Nature. 1990; 344: 444-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar, 35.Zon L.I. Gurish M.F. Stevens R.L. Mather C. Reynolds D.S. Austen K.F. Orkin S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22948-22953Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), GATA-2 and GATA-3 (35.Zon L.I. Gurish M.F. Stevens R.L. Mather C. Reynolds D.S. Austen K.F. Orkin S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22948-22953Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was detected in several mouse and rat mast cell lines but not in mouse 3T3 fibroblasts. These three GATA proteins are reported to regulate the promoter of the carboxypeptidase A gene in mast cells(35.Zon L.I. Gurish M.F. Stevens R.L. Mather C. Reynolds D.S. Austen K.F. Orkin S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22948-22953Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Hence, we consider the possibility that GATA factors direct T1 transcription in mast cells to the distal promoter. It is also striking that two of the four important GATA elements in the murine β-globin promoter (36.Barnhart K.M. Kim C.G. Sheffery M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 2606-2614Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) are at almost identical relative positions to those in the T1 gene (positions −210 and −75 in the β-globin and positions −210 and −76 in the T1 promoter). A further indication that the GATA elements might be important for mast cell-specific T1 transcription is the finding of a putative SP1 site adjacent to them. Cooperation of SP1 and GATA transcription factors has been observed for several genes(37.Lecointe N. Bernard O. Naert K. Joulin V. Larsen C.J. Romeo P.H. Mathieu M.D. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 2623-2632PubMed Google Scholar, 38.Max-Audit I. Eleouet J.F. Romeo P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5431-5437Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 39.Merika M. Orkin S.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2437-2447Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar). Promoter studies have been initiated to test whether these GATA elements and the SP1 binding site are indeed instrumental for mast cell-specific T1 gene expression and whether they work in concert with the T1 enhancer. This AP-1 binding regulatory element is centrally located between the two alternative first exons at position −3.6 kb, and it is essential for the induction of the proximal T1 promoter(4.Kalousek M.B. Trub T. Schuermann M. Klemenz R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6866-6873Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13.Trub T. Kalousek M.B. Frohli E. Klemenz R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3896-3900Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Moreover, Gong et al. have demonstrated that the transcription of the ϵ-globin promoter requires both promoter bound GATA-1 and enhancer bound AP-1/NF-E2, whereas GATA-1 acts solely as a mediator of the enhancer effect on transcription(5.Gong Q. Dean A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 911-917Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In summary, the T1 gene is transcribed from two promoters which are 10.5 kb apart. Their usage is strictly cell type-specific, as initiation at the distal and the proximal promoter exclusively occurs in mast cells and fibroblasts, respectively. Further characterization of the distal promoter containing the two GATA elements and one SP1 binding site will help to identify the transcription factors that orchestrate tissue-specific 5′ initiation. Differential expression of the putative T1 receptor protein and its soluble form is achieved by two independent tissue-specific events: transcription initiation at two promoters and alternative 3′ processing. T1 is therefore a particularly useful tool for gene regulation studies to reveal the mechanisms responsible for the tissue-specific expression of a transmembrane versus a secreted form of a protein.

INTRODUCTIONExposure of the purple nonsulfur bacterium Rhodospirillum rubrum to CO stimulates the expression of the coo regulon, which consists of at least two transcriptional units. Among the products of this regulon are a carbon monoxide dehydrogenase (CooS), an Fe-S protein (CooF), and a hydrogenase (CooH), where the two former proteins have been purified and characterized(1.Bonam D.

This CO-oxidizing system functions under anaerobic conditions to oxidize CO to CO2, allowing growth on CO as sole energy source(7.Kerby R.L. Ludden P.W. Roberts G.P. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 2241-2244Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The cooFSCTJ region has been cloned, sequenced, and mutationally characterized, verifying the requirement for the encoded products for oxidation of CO(7.Kerby R.L. Ludden P.W. Roberts G.P. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 2241-2244Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8.Kerby R.L. Hong S.S. Ensign S.A. Coppoc L.J. Ludden P.W. Roberts G.P. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 5284-5294Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). 1R. L. Kerby and G. P. Roberts, unpublished data. The mutational analysis has also indicated that cooFSCTJ is organized in a single transcriptional unit.1cooH lies at the 3′ terminus of the other known CO-regulated transcript, but this transcript has not yet been fully sequenced at the 5′ end. cooH is located 5′ of cooF and is separated from it by 450 nucleotides of noncoding DNA (Fig. 1B).Our previous mutational studies revealed that CooA, 2The abbreviations used are: CooACO oxidation activatorCRPcAMP receptor proteinbpbase pair(s)MOPS5-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid. which is apparently encoded on it own transcript on the 3′ side of cooFSCTJ, is essential for the expression of the coo regulon of R. rubrum in response to CO(9.Shelver D. Kerby R.L. He Y.-P. Roberts G.P. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 2157-2163Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The sequence of CooA predicts that it is a member of the CRP/FNR family of transcriptional regulators(9.Shelver D. Kerby R.L. He Y.-P. Roberts G.P. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 2157-2163Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), with a putative DNA-binding domain that is highly similar to that found in CRP and FNR. Modeling the sequence of CooA on the known CRP crystal structure (10.Weber I.T. Steitz T.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 198: 311-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar) predicts the presence of four Cys and one His residues adjacent to the region known to bind cAMP in CRP(9.Shelver D. Kerby R.L. He Y.-P. Roberts G.P. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 2157-2163Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These residues suggest the possibility that CooA contains a metal center at this position, which might be expected if CooA binds CO. A particularly interesting question in this area is how the binding of a molecule as small as CO might induce a similar conformation change in CooA as that caused by cAMP binding in CRP.To test the model of CooA as a CO-binding transcriptional activator, we have sought evidence for CO- and CooA-dependent DNA binding. The results described herein support the above model, and the assay of DNA-binding activity of CooA will aid in the purification of CooA for more direct analysis.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESGrowth of Bacterial StrainsR. rubrum strains were grown photoheterotrophically in SMN (supplemented malate-ammonium) medium supplemented with 10 μM NiCl2 in stoppered serum vials with an argon head space(8.Kerby R.L. Hong S.S. Ensign S.A. Coppoc L.J. Ludden P.W. Roberts G.P. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 5284-5294Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).For RNA isolation, cultures to be CO-induced were grown photoheterotrophically to an optical density of 1 at 680 nm, whereupon CO was added to a final concentration of 30%; uninduced culture received no additions. The cultures were agitated under illumination (8.Kerby R.L. Hong S.S. Ensign S.A. Coppoc L.J. Ludden P.W. Roberts G.P. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 5284-5294Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) for 6 h.The CooA-overexpressing strain (UR459) was grown under nif-derepression conditions in malate-glutamate medium (11.Lehman L. Roberts G.P. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 5705-5711Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) to an OD680 of 2.0, and the expression of nifH promoter was monitored by nitrogenase activity (12.Kanemoto R.H. Ludden P.W. J. Bacteriol. 1984; 158: 713-720Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).RNA ExtractionTotal cellular RNA was isolated by repeated phenol extraction as described previously (13.Sarmientos P. Sylvester J.E. Contente S. Cashel M. Cell. 1983; 32: 1337-1346Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. After addition of 1.5 ml of lysis solution to 6 ml of culture, the mixture was boiled for 90 s and extracted with phenol 3 times. Purified RNA was dissolved in 100 μl of 10 mM Tris-Cl (pH 8.0).Primer Extension of mRNATwo synthetic oligonucleotide primers (Operon Technologies Inc.) were used: Primer 1 (5′-GATCGGGATTGGCGTAGATG) is complementary to the coding strand in region +27 to +46 (numbering relative to the translational start codon of cooF) and Primer 2 (5′-GAATTAACGCCACCCCTGTTCG) is complementary to the coding strand in region −154 to −133. Primers were labeled at their 5′-ends with [γ-32P]ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase(14.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The primer extension was performed as described (15.Josaitis C.A. Gall T. Gourse R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1117-1121Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) except that 25 μg of total RNA was mixed with 0.25 pmol of γ-32P-labeled primer. The extended products were analyzed by electrophoresis on a 6% polyacrylamide-urea gel.Construction of Plasmids for Heterologous ExpressionPlasmid pCO6R (9.Shelver D. Kerby R.L. He Y.-P. Roberts G.P. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 2157-2163Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was processed through a number of steps to delete coo DNA outside the region of interest (data not shown), creating two derivatives. In both, the 5′-end of the coo DNA was at a newly created BamHI site at position −72 relative to the transcriptional start of cooF. The clone carrying cooFSCTJ had a 3′-end 113 bp downstream of the translational stop of cooJ, while the clone carrying cooFSCTJA had a 3′-end 272 bp downstream of the translational stop of cooA. The gentamycin-resistance Ω cassette of pGMΩ1 (16.Schwiezer H.P. BioTechniques. 1993; 15: 831-833PubMed Google Scholar) was then inserted at the BamHI site, and the inserts were excised by PvuII, isolated, ligated into BamHI-cut (Klenow polymerase-blunted) pRK404E1 3L. Leman and G. P. Roberts, unpublished data. to generate plasmids pCO46R (cooFSCTJ) and pCO47R (cooFSCTJA). These plasmids were subsequently transformed into UQ324 (17.Simon R. Priefer U. Pühler A. Bio/Technology. 1983; 1: 784-791Crossref Scopus (5593) Google Scholar) and mated to Rhodobacter sphaeroides 2.4.1 (UR363) by the usual method, 4D. P. Lies, personal communication. with selection for resistance to tetracycline (1 μg/ml) and tellurite (K2TeO3, 10 μg/ml)(18.Mackenzie C. Chidambaram M. Sodergren E.J. Kaplan S. Weinstock G.M. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 3027-3035Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), generating strains UR453 (pCO46R) and UR454 (pCO47R).CO Dehydrogenase AssayCooS activity with the CO-dependent reduction of methyl viologen was measured by the plate overlay assay (9.Shelver D. Kerby R.L. He Y.-P. Roberts G.P. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 2157-2163Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or by a spectrophotometric method(8.Kerby R.L. Hong S.S. Ensign S.A. Coppoc L.J. Ludden P.W. Roberts G.P. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 5284-5294Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, R. sphaeroides strains UR363, −453, and −454 were cultivated aerobically in SMN medium containing 2 μg/ml tetracycline then transferred to anaerobic SMN medium supplemented with 10 μM nickel for overnight photosynthetic growth. Cultures were then diluted to an OD680 = 1.0 and cultivated in the presence or absence of CO for 4 h prior to lysis and CO dehydrogenase assays. 50% of the UR453 and UR454 clones remained tetracycline-resistant under these assay conditions.Overexpression of CooA in R. rubrumTo overexpress CooA in R. rubrum, a plasmid fusing PnifH to cooA was constructed and introduced to R. rubrum in the following manner. pDWS119(9.Shelver D. Kerby R.L. He Y.-P. Roberts G.P. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 2157-2163Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), a pUX19-derived plasmid that carries cooA, was digested with BamHI and XmnI. The resulting 6348-bp fragment, which carries cooA, a portion of the putative cooA promoter, and the vector portion of pDWS119, was ligated to the 412-bp BamHI-HincII fragment from pUX111 (19.Grunwald S.K. Lies D.P. Roberts G.P. Ludden P.W. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 628-635Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) that carries the R. rubrum nifH promoter region (20.Lehman L. Fitzmaurice W.P. Roberts G.P. Gene (Amst.). 1990; 95: 143-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) and the 5′-portion of the nifH coding region of R. rubrum, creating pDWS126.The PcooA and nifH coding material remaining in pDWS126 (77 bp total) was deleted to create a junction between the ribosome binding site of nifH and the initiation codon of cooA in the following way. A primer, 5′-CGATGTTGAAACGAGGCGGCATGGAATCAATCCTTTTCTTCGGTGATCCGGTCTTAAGGCGGG, (double underline indicates a base change (C to T) from the wild-type PnifH region to create a new AflII site (single underline)) was synthesized (Genosys Biotechnologies) and used for site-directed mutagenesis by a modification of the unique site elimination procedure(21.Win P.D. Nickoloff J.A. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 200: 81-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (1079) Google Scholar), utilizing a single primer incorporating the desired deletion as well as a selectable restriction site (Bsu36I) loss. The desired plasmid (pDWS131) was identified by the presence of an new site in the plasmid (AflII) derived from the primer. The PnifH region and cooA on pDWS131 were verified by sequencing in one direction. pDWS131, which is a mobilizeable plasmid that does not replicate in R. rubrum, was used to transform Escherichia coli strain S17-1(17.Simon R. Priefer U. Pühler A. Bio/Technology. 1983; 1: 784-791Crossref Scopus (5593) Google Scholar), and the resulting strain was mated with R. rubrum strain UR2 (coo+).4 Strains with pDWS131 integrated into the UR2 chromosome by homologous recombination were selected for kanamycin (15 μg/ml). A single transconjugant, R. rubrum strain UR459, was used for further study.Crude Extract PreparationCultures were harvested by centrifugation at 4,800 × g for 15 min, and all handling of extracts utilized anoxic technique due to concern over the possible O2-lability of CooA. The cell pellets were resuspended in buffer A (25 mM MOPS (pH 7.4), 1 mM phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 1 mg/ml leupeptin, 1.7 mM sodium dithionite, 1 mM dithiothreitol) and passed through a French press at 16,000 p.s.i. The mixture was centrifuged at 13,200 × g for 1 h to remove the debris. The supernatant, to which glycerol was added to 5% (w/v) for storage, was used for the DNA-binding assay. The total protein concentration was determined by the Bradford dye binding procedure (22.Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (213462) Google Scholar) using the protein assay dye reagent concentrate (Bio-Rad).DNase I FootprintingA 294-bp EcoRV-EagI fragment (Fig. 1B), which contains the PcooF region, was used for both DNase I footprinting and gel retardation assays. This fragment was isolated from a pBSKS(-)-derivative (Stratagene), pCO17, which contains a portion of the coo region from pLJC24(23.Coppoc, L. J. (1991) Studies Concerning the Carbon Monoxide Dehydrogenase of Rhodospirillum rubrum. M.Sc. thesis, University of Wisconsin, Madison, WIGoogle Scholar). The fragment was uniquely 3′-end-labeled in the coding strand by filling the EagI end with [α- α-32P]dGTP and Sequenase, followed by purification via polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (14.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) and an Elutip Minicolumn (Schleicher & Schuell). DNase I footprinting analysis of the PcooF region was performed as described previously (24.Filutowicz M. Uhlenhopp E. Helinski D.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1985; 187: 225-239Crossref Scopus (54) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. The sealed tubes used for the protein-DNA binding reaction were degassed, and the head space was filled with argon. The DNA binding reactions were done under stringently anoxic conditions in the buffer B (20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 7 mM MgCl2, 50 mM KCl, 7 mM dithiothreitol, 50 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 5% (w/v) glycerol) supplemented with 1.7 mM sodium dithionite in the presence or absence of CO. After 5-10 pmol of DNA was incubated with various amount of extracts in a 20-μl volume at room temperature for 20 min, the mixtures were treated with 2 units/ml RQ RNase-free DNase I (Promega) for 30 s. DNase I cleavage products were separated on a 6% (w/v) polyacrylamide-urea gel.Gel Retardation AssayRadiolabeled DNA fragments were prepared similar to those in the footprinting experiment. The DNA-binding reactions were performed anoxically in the same buffer and at the same temperature used in the footprinting assays. The samples were applied to an anoxic 5% polyacrylamide gel (37.5:1 acrylamide/bis ratio) in standard 1 × Tris borate/EDTA buffer (14.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) with 1.7 mM sodium dithionite. After prerunning at 180 V for 1.5 h, the upper running buffer was changed once in order to maintain strictly anoxic conditions. The electrophoresis was performed at 180 V for 3 h in 4°C.RESULTSLocation of a CO-induced 5′-End mRNA of cooFIn order to identify the coo promoter upstream of cooF and to determine the effect of CO on its expression, we performed primer extension analysis on coo mRNA from both CO-induced and uninduced wild-type R. rubrum (strain UR2). Initially, we used a primer (Primer 1) that hybridized near the beginning of cooF coding region. The extension product suggested that the 5′-end of the cooF mRNA was approximately 250 nucleotides upstream from the translational start site of cooF. This signal was present only in the CO-induced sample, and no other primer extension products were observed (data not shown).In order to more precisely identify the 5′-end of the cooF mRNA, a second primer (Primer 2) was designed that hybridized about 150 nucleotides upstream of cooF coding region. Results with this primer showed that the major transcript from the cooF promoter initiates with the A nucleotide positioned 257 bp upstream from the start codon of cooF. A minor product starting six nucleotides upstream of that site was also observed. These primer extension products were only detectable in the CO-induced culture (Fig. 1A), indicating that the effect of CO is on the accumulation of coo mRNA. Fig. 1B shows a schematic of the transcription start site relative to other features in the region, including the putative CooA-binding site (see below).CooA Is Sufficient for CO-dependent Expression in a Heterologous SystemAs noted above, mutant analysis has shown that CooA is necessary for CO-dependent expression(9.Shelver D. Kerby R.L. He Y.-P. Roberts G.P. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 2157-2163Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To test the possibility that CooA was sufficient for the response, consistent with the hypothesis that it was actually the CO sensor, two derivatives of plasmid pRK were created. The first carried cooFSCTJ (pCO46R), and the second contained cooFSCTJA (pCO47R). These two constructs were introduced into E. coli and R. sphaeroides and were tested for their ability to produce CO dehydrogenase in response to CO. The E. coli strains showed no detectable CO dehydrogenase activity by the plate overlay assay (data not shown). Likewise, the R. sphaeroides strain (UR453) with pCO46R and the parent strain (UR363) accumulated no CO dehydrogenase activity detectable by either the plate overlay assay or the in vitro spectrophotometric assay. In contrast, the R. sphaeroides strain with pCO47R, upon CO induction, produced detectable CO dehydrogenase (0.23 μmol of CO oxidized/min/OD680) in the spectrophotometric assay. Because R. sphaeroides lacks an endogenous coo system, it is likely that CooA is the CO sensor in this heterologous system.Overexpression of CooA in R. rubrumWe expected that CooA, as a regulatory protein, would be nonabundant and thus anticipated that its activity would be difficult to detect in crude extracts. Consequently, we overexpressed CooA in R. rubrum from the R. rubrum nifH promoter and ribosome binding site. This promoter, which is active when R. rubrum is grown under nitrogen-fixing conditions, has been successfully used in our lab to overproduce nonabundant regulatory proteins (19.Grunwald S.K. Lies D.P. Roberts G.P. Ludden P.W. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 628-635Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and has the potential to produce 1% of total cell protein. Construction of the PnifH::cooA fusion and its integration into R. rubrum, creating strain UR459, are described under “Experimental Procedures.Extracts of UR459 (PnifH::cooA) were examined by SDS-polyacrylamide gel for the presence of a protein band corresponding to CooA. The extracts of UR2 and UR407 (cooA::aacC1)(9.Shelver D. Kerby R.L. He Y.-P. Roberts G.P. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 2157-2163Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), grown under the same conditions as UR459, were used as controls, as CooA was deficient in UR407 and is not expected to be detectable in UR2. A band migrating at about 25 kDa, the predicted molecular mass of CooA, was significantly more intense in extracts of UR459 than in those of UR2 or UR407 (data not shown).CooA- and CO-dependent DNA BindingTo test the hypothesis that CooA is a CO-sensing transcriptional activator, in vitro interactions between CooA and the promoter region of cooF were investigated with or without CO. A 294-bp EcoRV-EagI fragment, which contains the cooF promoter region from position −248 to +46 (Fig. 1B), was used as a probe in both DNase I footprinting and gel retardation assays. Crude extracts of strains that overproduce CooA (UR459), lack CooA (UR407), and have the normal low level (UR2) were prepared anoxically, due to concern that CooA might be O2-labile. All protein-DNA binding reactions were also kept under stringently anoxic and reduced conditions.In DNase I protection experiments (Fig. 2A), a specific pattern of protection was detected only with extracts from the CooA-overproducing strain in the presence of CO. No protection was observed in the same extract in the absence of CO, nor in the extract of the cooA mutant (UR407) regardless of the presence of CO in the binding reaction. This protection was not detectable with extracts of wild-type in presence of CO (data not shown), presumably due to low levels of CooA.Figure 2:Identification of the CooA binding site. Panel A shows the result of a DNase I footprinting experiment. A 294-bp EcoRV-EagI fragment containing the promoter region of cooF was used in this assay. CooA- refers to extracts of UR407 (cooA::aacC1) and CooA++ refers to extracts of UR459 (the CooA-overproducer with cooA under PnifH control). The numbers reflect micrograms of protein in each assay, and the + and - on the line labeled CO reflect the presence or absence of CO in the binding reaction; all experiments were performed anoxically. The G+A lane represents the Maxam-Gilbert sequencing marker. The box on the right side indicates the region protected in this experiment. Panel B shows a comparison of the CRP and FNR consensus binding sites with the detected CooA-binding site.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The site protected by CooA covers 28 bases (position −27 to −54) and contains a sequence of 2-fold symmetry (Fig. 1B) that is highly similar to the consensus sequence motif recognized by CRP/FNR in E. coli (Fig. 2B).Gel retardation analysis with the same DNA fragment and extracts also revealed a DNA-protein complex whose presence requires both CooA and CO (data not shown). This CooA- and CO-dependent complex is very large; it remained in the wells of a 5% polyacrylamide (19:1 acrylamide/bis ratio) gel but entered a 5% polyacrylamide (37.5:1 acrylamide/bis ratio) gel, suggesting the presence of additional proteins in this complex.DISCUSSIONOur previous mutational studies and sequence analysis of cooA led us to predict that CooA is a CO-sensing transcriptional activator similar to CRP and FNR. The work presented in this paper and elsewhere strongly supports the hypothesis that CooA is a CO-sensing protein responsible for controlled expression of the coo region in a fashion reminiscent of the action of CRP: (i) Northern blot analysis1 and primer extension experiments demonstrate that CO affects mRNA accumulation; (ii) CooA is sufficient for CO-dependent expression in R. sphaeroides; (iii) DNA binding appears to be CooA- and CO-dependent in vitro; (iv) the detected CooA target site is very similar to the CRP/FNR consensus binding site; and (v) CooA is very similar to CPR and FNR in the helix-turn-helix DNA binding domain(9.Shelver D. Kerby R.L. He Y.-P. Roberts G.P. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 2157-2163Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).We initially looked for the CooA-binding site by both footprinting and gel retardation assays in the 250-bp EagI-BsmI region immediately upstream of cooF (Fig. 1B), in part because a strain (UR284) with an insertion at the EagI site (Fig. 1B) displayed CooS activity in a CO-dependent manner(8.Kerby R.L. Hong S.S. Ensign S.A. Coppoc L.J. Ludden P.W. Roberts G.P. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 5284-5294Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We now believe that the observed expression in UR284 reflects transcription from PcooF through the Kanr insertion; the Kanr gene is derived from pUC4K and apparently lacks transcriptional terminators. No CooA- or CO-dependent DNA binding could be found between the EagI site and cooF (data not shown), however, and the transcriptional start site identified in this paper is clearly the physiologically significant one in vivo.While the detected transcription start lacks the −10 and −35 sequences expected at a typical E. coli σ70 promoter, a typical E. coli σ54 recognition sequence is present, with GC and GG at −13 and −25, respectively (25.Morett E. Buck M. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 210: 65-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1B). An interaction of CooA with σ54 would be interesting as no CRP- or FNR-controlled promoters are known to be recognized by σ54.The center of the two-fold symmetry of the CooA binding site is at −43.5 with respect to the transcriptional start point of cooF. This distance is similar to the location of the CRP sites in class II CRP-dependent promoters (e.g. galP 1) and FNR sites in the FNR-dependent promoters(26.Ebright R.H. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 8: 797-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 27). In CRP, the specific interaction between the side chains of the protein and a given base within the core motif 5′-TGTGA-3′ have been reviewed(28, 29): Arg-180 and Glu-181 directly contact the 5′-G and the nucleotide of complementary to the 3′-G, respectively. It is possible that Arg-177 of CooA, which is in the homologous position of Arg-180 of CRP, contacts the 5′-G of the CooA target site 5′-TGTCA-3′. The absence of a Glu in CooA corresponding to Glu-181 in CRP is consistent with the fact that there is a 3′-C instead of a 3′-G in the CooA target site (Fig. 2B).We are currently employing the described gel shift as a functional assay for the purification of CooA. Analysis of the purified protein, together with the eventual determination of the CooA-regulated promoter upstream of cooH, will significantly increase our understanding of this regulatory response. INTRODUCTIONExposure of the purple nonsulfur bacterium Rhodospirillum rubrum to CO stimulates the expression of the coo regulon, which consists of at least two transcriptional units. Among the products of this regulon are a carbon monoxide dehydrogenase (CooS), an Fe-S protein (CooF), and a hydrogenase (CooH), where the two former proteins have been purified and characterized(1.Bonam D.

This CO-oxidizing system functions under anaerobic conditions to oxidize CO to CO2, allowing growth on CO as sole energy source(7.Kerby R.L. Ludden P.W. Roberts G.P. J.

The mutational analysis has also indicated that cooFSCTJ is organized in a single transcriptional unit.1cooH lies at the 3′ terminus of the other known CO-regulated transcript, but this transcript has not yet been fully sequenced at the 5′ end. cooH is located 5′ of cooF and is separated from it by 450 nucleotides of noncoding DNA (Fig. 1B).Our previous mutational studies revealed that CooA, 2The abbreviations used are: CooACO oxidation activatorCRPcAMP receptor proteinbpbase pair(s)MOPS5-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid. which is apparently encoded on it own transcript on the 3′ side of cooFSCTJ, is essential for the expression of the coo regulon of R. rubrum in response to CO(9.Shelver D.

PPAR binding to PPREs requires the retinoic acid X receptor (RXR) for forming the high affinity PPAR•RXR heterodimer(14.Kliewer S.A. Umesono K. Noonan D.J. Heyman R.A. Evans R.M. Nature. 1992; 358: 771-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (1525) Google Scholar). The putative binding of HD/PPs to PPARs and the role of HD/PPs in initiating the binding of PPAR/RXR to PPREs still remains to be investigated(9.Issemann I. Green S. Nature. 1990; 347: 645-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (3059) Google Scholar). Since some HD/PPs are extensively used in humans as hypolipidemic drugs (15.Sirtori C.R. Franceschini G. Pharmacol. Ther. 1988; 37: 167-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) and since transcriptional suppression, rather than activation, mediated by the HD/PP-PPAR/RXR-PPRE transduction pathway may complement the pleiotropic biological effect exerted by HD/PPs, we became interested in elucidating the mode of action of HD/PPs as putative suppressors of liver Tf. Liver Tf gene suppression by HD/PPs will be shown here to be mediated by PPAR/RXR and to involve the HNF-4 enhancer element of the Tf gene promoter. Male albino rats weighing 150-200 g were fed with laboratory chow diet. 0.25% (w/w) Medica 16 was added to their diet where indicated. Hep G2, CV-1, and COS-7 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's media supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum with either Me2SO as vehicle or 120 μM Medica 16 added to the culture medium where indicated. Hep G2 nuclei were prepared according to (16.Sasaki K. Cripe T.P. Koch S.R. Andreone T.L. Petersen D.D. Beale E.G. Granner D.K. J. Biol.

Transcriptional activity was measured in cells cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Cells were transfected for 6 h with the respective CsCl-purified plasmid DNA added by calcium phosphate precipitation, washed, and further cultured for 42 h in the absence or presence of 120 μM of Medica 16 added as 1000× stock in dimethyl sulfoxide. The β-galactosidase expression vector pRSGAL (2 μg) added to each precipitate served as an internal control for transfection. When transfected with variable amounts of expression vectors, total amount of DNA was kept constant for each expression vector by supplementing with the parent pSG5 vector (18.Green S. Issemann I. Sheer E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 369Crossref PubMed Scopus (547) Google Scholar). Cell extracts were prepared by freeze-thawing and assayed for β-galactosidase and CAT activities. Results are expressed as fold induction relative to CAT expression observed in cells transfected with the parent pSG5 vector. Each point represents the mean of duplicate cultures differing by no more than 10%. Gel mobility shift assays were carried out using rat nuclear extracts(19.Gorski M. Carneiro M. Schibler M. Cell. 1986; 47: 767-776Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (973) Google Scholar), in vitro synthesized transcription factors, or whole COS extracts overexpressing the respectively transfected expression vectors. hRXR and rHNF-4 cDNAs cloned in pSG5 were linearized by XbaI and transcribed (Stratagene) and translated in rabbit reticulocytes (Promega). COS extracts enriched with PPAR, RXR, or HNF-4 were prepared from COS-7 cells transfected for 5 h by calcium phosphate precipitation with 10 μg of pSG5, pSG5-PPAR, pSG5-RXR, pSG5-HNF-4, or selected combinations of the above plasmids. Following transfection, cells were incubated for 48 h, harvested, lysed by three cycles of freezing-thawing in 100 μl/plate of lysis buffer (600 mM KCl, 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, and 1 μg/ml leupeptin), and centrifuged at 20,000 g for 15 min; the supernatants were then aliquoted and stored at −70°C. For gel shift assays, programmed or unprogrammed reticulocyte lysates (2 μl) or whole COS extracts (4 μg) as indicated were incubated for 20 min on ice in 11 mM Hepes (pH 7.9) containing 50 mM KCl, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 2.5 mM MgCl2, 10% glycerol, 1 μg of poly(dI-dC) in a final volume of 20 μl. 0.1 ng of the respective 32P-labeled oligonucleotide was then added, and incubation was continued for an additional 20 min at room temperature. Protein-DNA complexes were resolved on a 5% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel in 0.5 × TBE. Rat Tf cDNA (20.Levin M.J. Tuil D. Uzan G. Dreyfus J.C. Kahn A. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Clones containing one copy of the PRI element were isolated, and their 5′-3′ orientation was confirmed by sequencing. (−620/+39)hTf-CAT, 5′-deleted constructs of (−620/+39)hTf-CAT, (−620/+39)hTf(PRI mut)-CAT, and (−620/+39)hTf(PRIIa mut)-CAT were as described previously(22.Schaeffer E. Guillou F. Part D. Zakin M.M.

Sladek (Riverside, CA). pSG5-HNF-4 expression plasmid was constructed by inserting the BamHI fragment of pLEN4S encoding the entire 3-kilobase HNF-4 cDNA into the BamHI site of pSG5. pSG5-mPPAR expression plasmid (9.Issemann I.

Nature. 1990; 345: 224-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (1258) Google Scholar) was from R. Evans (La Jolla, CA). pSG5-RXR expression plasmid was constructed by inserting the EcoRI fragment of RS-hRXRα into the EcoRI site of pSG5. The 50% reduction in plasma Tf in rats treated with Medica 162 was accompanied by a respective decrease in liver rTf mRNA (Fig. 1A), thus indicating that the HD/PP effect could be accounted for by pretranslational inhibition of Tf expression. A decrease in Tf mRNA was similarly observed in human transformed Hep G2 liver cells incubated in the presence of Medica 16 (Fig. 1B), thus pointing to the direct effect exerted by HD/PPs on cells expressing Tf. Suppression of liver Tf mRNA by Medica 16 was accompanied by inhibition of Tf transcription rate as verified by run-on transcription assays in Hep G2 cell nuclei (Fig. 2). Incubation in the presence of Medica 16 for 72 h resulted in a pronounced inhibition of Tf transcription rate, indicating that reduction in Tf mRNA exerted by Medica 16 treatment may be ascribed to suppression of transcription of liver Tf gene by Medica 16. Essentially similar decreases in Tf mRNA and Tf transcription rates were observed using bezafibrate (not shown), thus generalizing the observed effect to other members of the HD/PP class of compounds. Transfection experiments in hepatoma cells using 5′- and 3′-deleted mutants of the human Tf gene promoter have previously implicated the first 620 nucleotides of the Tf promoter in regulating the expression of the Tf gene in liver cells (22.Schaeffer E.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 5717-5721Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), as well as by in vitro binding assays using liver nuclear extracts(22.Schaeffer E. Guillou F. Part D. Zakin M.M. J.

Chem. 1991; 266: 24220-24225Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), have indicated that three distinct functional regions were involved in regulating liver Tf transcription by the (−620/+1) hTf promoter, namely, the (−76/-51)Tf-PRI element, the (−103/-83) Tf-PRII element, and an upstream promoter region within the (−620/-125) Tf promoter sequence, which modulates the activity of the two proximal promoter elements. Tf gene suppression by HD/PP was therefore further analyzed in Hep G2 cells transfected with the (−620/+39) hTf promoter linked to a CAT reporter gene and incubated in the presence and absence of added Medica 16. The putative involvement of PPAR and RXR in the Medica 16 effect was verified by cotransfecting the cells with expression vectors for PPAR and RXR, respectively. As shown in Fig. 3, A and B, CAT expression from the (−620/+39)hTf-CAT construct was 25-50% inhibited by incubating the cells in the presence of added Medica 16. CAT expression in the presence of Medica 16 was further inhibited by cotransfecting the cells with expression vectors for both PPAR and RXR, indicating that the PPAR•RXR heterodimer was involved in Tf gene suppression by Medica 16. Inhibition of CAT expression by Medica 16 in the absence of cotransfected PPAR and RXR may therefore be accounted for by endogenous PPAR and RXR in Hep G2 cells. It is noteworthy that similarly to other genes affected by the PPAR/RXR transduction pathway, cotransfecting the cells with expression vectors for PPAR and RXR resulted in inhibition of CAT expression from the (−620/+39)hTf-CAT construct even in the absence of added Medica 16. Ligand-independent transcriptional modulation of Tf (Fig. 3A) and other genes (11.Tugwood J.D. Issemann I. Anderson R.G. Bundell K. McPheat W. Green S. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 433-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (804) Google Scholar, 12.Muerhoff A.S. Griffin K.J. Johnson E.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19051-19053Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13.Issemann I. Prince R. Tugwood J. Green S. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1992; 20: 824-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) 3 by PPAR/RXR might reflect the presence of an endogenous PPAR activator or the constitutive capacity of the PPAR•RXR heterodimer to modulate transcription of concerned genes. The role played by Medica 16 in Tf gene suppression by PPAR/RXR was better exemplified using PPAR-G (12.Muerhoff A.S. Griffin K.J. Johnson E.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19051-19053Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 3B), having a lower constitutive (ligand-independent) activity as compared with PPAR due, perhaps, to its lower affinity for the endogenous HD/PP ligand. These results may therefore indicate that transcriptional suppression of Tf by Medica 16 is mediated by PPAR/RXR affecting an element within the (−620/+39) Tf promoter sequence. The promoter element involved in transcriptional suppression of the Tf gene by PPAR/RXR and Medica 16 was further characterized by transfecting Hep G2 cells with 5′-deleted constructs of the Tf promoter linked to CAT and analyzing the effect exerted by cotransfected PPAR/RXR and added Medica 16 on expression of the concerned constructs. As shown in Fig. 3C, CAT expression promoted either by the (−620/+39)hTf or (−125/+39)hTf promoter sequences, which consist of the Tf-PRI as well as the Tf-PRII elements, was suppressed by cotransfected PPAR/RXR in the absence or presence of Medica 16, thus pointing to a PPAR/RXR responsive element within the (−125/+39)hTf promoter sequence. Deleting the Tf-PRII element resulted in a 7-fold decrease in CAT expression, reflecting the synergistic role played by Tf-PRI and -II in Tf transcription. However, transcriptional suppression by PPAR/RXR was still maintained in the (−82/+39)hTf-CAT construct. On the other hand, deleting both the PRI and PRII elements resulted in loss of suppression by PPAR/RXR, thus indicating that transcriptional suppression of the Tf gene by PPAR/RXR involves the Tf-PRI element. The role played by the Tf-PRI element in transcriptional suppression of the Tf gene by PPAR/RXR was further verified in Hep G2 cells transfected with (−620/+39)Tf-CAT constructs mutated in either the PRI ((−620/+39)hTf(PRI mut)-CAT) or PRII ((−620/+39)hTf(PRII mut)-CAT) elements (22.Schaeffer E. Guillou F. Part D. Zakin M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23399-23408Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and cotransfected with expression vectors for PPAR and RXR. As shown in Fig. 3D, expression from the Tf-PRII mutated construct was 50% inhibited as compared with the respective wild type construct. However, the PRII mutation did not interfere with transcriptional suppression by PPAR/RXR. Expression from the Tf-PRI mutated construct was 90% inhibited as compared with the wild type construct and could not be further suppressed by PPAR/RXR. Hence, suppression of the liver Tf gene by PPAR/RXR appears to be specifically mediated by the Tf-PRI element. Transfection studies were complemented by studying binding of PPAR and/or RXR to the hTf-PRI sequence using mobility shift analysis. As shown in Fig. 4A, the PPAR•RXR heterodimer transcribed and translated in vitro in rabbit reticulocytes, but not the respective individual receptors, indeed binds to the hTf-PRI element. Similarly, PPAR derived from transfected COS cells (Fig. 4B) and complemented by endogenous or transfected RXR specifically binds to the hTf-PRI element and may be supershifted by anti-mPPAR antibody. The hTf gene in the liver system has recently been reported to be transactivated by HNF-4 and to bind HNF-4 to the Tf-PRI element(22.Schaeffer E. Guillou F. Part D. Zakin M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23399-23408Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Transcriptional suppression of the Tf gene by PPAR/RXR mediated by the Tf-PRI element (Fig. 3) could therefore be ascribed to PPAR/RXR interference with HNF-4 transcriptional activation of the liver Tf gene. PPAR/RXR interference with HNF-4 binding to the Tf-PRI element was studied by comparing the Tf-PRI binding affinities of HNF-4 and PPAR/RXR using gel shift assays. As shown in Fig. 5, both HNF-4 and PPAR/RXR could bind to the hTf-PRI element sequence with apparent binding affinities of 2.7 ± 0.3 and 3.6 ± 0.6 nM hTf-PRI (mean ± S.D. for three independent experiments), respectively, thus indicating that the two receptors could compete for binding to the concerned element. Their functional interaction with the hTf-PRI element in the context of the heterologous thymidine kinase promoter was analyzed in CV-1 cells transfected with a hTf-PRI-TK-CAT construct consisting of the hTf-PRI element in front of the thymidine kinase promoter (Fig. 6). Cotransfecting these cells with either HNF-4 or PPAR/RXR resulted in 10- and ×4-fold activation of CAT expression, indicating that PPAR/RXR binding to the hTf-PRI element in the context of the heterologous TK promoter may result in its transactivation.Figure 6:Transactivation of hTf-PRI-TK-CAT by PPAR and RXR. CV-1 cells were transfected as described under “Experimental Procedures” with the hTF-PRI-TK-CAT reporter construct (5 μg) promoted by the thymidine kinase promoter and cotransfected with pSG5 (0.4 μg), pSG5-HNF-4 (0.2 μg), or pSG5-PPAR (0.2 μg) and pSG5-RXR (0.2 μg) expression vectors as indicated. CAT activity is presented by its fold induction, where the activity of the reporter construct cotransfected with pSG5 is taken as 1. Representative experiment is shown out of three experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The functional relationship between PPAR/RXR and HNF-4 within the context of the homologous hTf promoter was studied in CV-1 cells transfected with the (−125/+39)hTf-CAT construct and cotransfected with expression vectors for HNF-4, PPAR, and RXR. As shown in Fig. 7, HNF-4, but not PPAR/RXR, activated CAT expression promoted by the homologous (−125/+39)hTf proximal promoter. Furthermore, cotransfecting the cells with both HNF-4 and PPAR/RXR resulted in eliminating HNF-4 activation of the Tf gene. Hence, PPAR/RXR binding to the hTf-PRI element in the context of the homologous Tf promoter is nonproductive but interferes with HNF-4 productive binding to this element, resulting in inhibition of HNF-4-enhanced transcriptional transactivation of the liver Tf gene. HD/PPs have recently been reported by us to suppress liver HNF-4 mRNA and protein in HD/PP-treated rats and Hep G2 cells(17.Hertz R. Bishara-Shieban J. Bar-Tana J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13470-13475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). Since HNF-4 is a major liver nuclear transcription factor, which may bind and transactivate Tf gene transcription, its reduced liver content in HD/PP-treated rats could result in its lower availability for binding to the Tf-PRI element with a concomitant reduced expression of the liver Tf gene in treated animals. This mode of action of Medica 16 could complement the direct suppressive mode mediated by HNF-4 displacement from the Tf-PRI element by PPAR/RXR. The availability of HNF-4 for binding and transactivating Tf gene transcription in nuclear extracts derived from Medica 16-treated rats was verified by analyzing the extent of binding of liver nuclear extracts of treated and nontreated rats to the hTf-PRI element. Bound HNF-4 in the respective extracts was identified by the extent of HNF-4 supershifted by added anti-HNF-4 antibodies. As shown in Fig. 8, nuclear extract binding to the Tf-PRI element was significantly reduced in Medica 16-treated rats and specifically accounted for by the lower availability of HNF-4 in nuclear extracts of treated animals. Hence, in addition to HNF-4 displacement from the Tf promoter by PPAR/RXR binding, HNF-4 suppression by Medica 16 may be pivotal to the overall suppressive effect of Medica 16 on Tf gene transcription. The decrease in plasma Tf observed in rats treated with hypolipidemic peroxisome proliferators was shown here to be accompanied by a decrease in liver Tf mRNA and to result from transcriptional suppression of the liver Tf gene as verified by run-on transcription assays in liver nuclei derived from Hep G2 cells. Since the level of plasma Tf is dominated by liver Tf expression and secretion, transcriptional suppression of liver Tf by HD/PP may account for the reduced plasma Tf levels in treated animals. Furthermore, since Tf transcriptional suppression was similarly observed in human Hep G2 cells incubated in the presence of added HD/PP, Tf suppression could be relevant to dyslipoproteinemic patients treated with HD/PP. Transcriptional suppression of liver Tf gene by Medica 16 was found here to be related to HNF-4-enhanced transcription of the Tf gene and ascribed to displacement of HNF-4 from the Tf promoter by nonproductive binding of PPAR/RXR to the Tf-PRI (HNF-4 enhancer) element. The PPAR•RXR heterodimer behaves in this respect similarly to other previously reported transcription factors, e.g. ARP-1, which may compete with HNF-4 for binding to HNF-4 enhancer elements(33.Ladias J.A.A. Hadzopoulou-Cladaras M. Kardassis D. Cardot P. Cheng J. Zannis V. Cladaras C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15849-15860Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 34.Mietus-Snyder M. Sladek F.M.

The extent of inhibition of Tf transcription by PPAR/RXR in a specific cell type may therefore be expected to reflect the prevailing content of concerned transcription factors and their respective binding affinities for the Tf-PRI element. Since the liver system is highly enriched in HNF-4 as compared with chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter transcription factor or ARP-1(34.Mietus-Snyder M. Sladek F.M. Ginsburg G.S. Kuo C.F. Ladias J.A.A. Darnell Jr., J.E. Karathanasis S.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 1708-1718Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar), transfection with PPAR/RXR, or activating the endogenous PPAR/RXR by HD/PP or using both intervention modes results in Tf suppression. However, in cell types where the Tf-PRI function is dominated by suppressive transcription factors, HD/PP may exert an apparent transactivation of transcription mediated by displacing the concerned suppressive transcription factors by nonproductive binding of PPAR/RXR. The resultant effect in a specific cell type may be further confounded by competition for RXR between some of the concerned transcription factors in addition to competing for the same promoter element. It should be pointed out, however, that generalizing the mode of action of HD/PP as verified here in cells transiently transfected with Tf-promoted CAT constructs to the endogenous Tf promoter still remains to be complemented by studying the chromatin context of the endogenous gene as well as the role played by additional regulatory sequences of the Tf promoter not present in the transiently transfected promoter constructs used here. In addition to suppressing Tf transcription by PPAR/RXR binding to the Tf-PRI element, HD/PP may suppress Tf transcription by suppressing HNF-4 expression. Suppression of HNF-4 transcription by HD/PP has previously been verified by showing that HNF-4 transcription rates and transcript and protein levels were significantly reduced in livers of treated animals(17.Hertz R. Bishara-Shieban J. Bar-Tana J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13470-13475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). These previous results have been confirmed here in the context of the Tf gene by showing that the availability of HNF-4 for binding to the hTf-PRI element was significantly reduced in liver nuclear extracts derived from treated animals. Since HNF-4 expression is positively modulated by HNF-4 itself(35.Sladek F.M. Tronche F. Yanin M. Transcriptional Regulation of Liver-specific Genes. R. G. Landes Co., Austin, TX1994Google Scholar), suppression of HNF-4 gene expression by HD/PP may perhaps result as well from PPAR/RXR binding and displacement of HNF-4 from its putative enhancer in the HNF-4 gene promoter. The increasing list of promoter elements reported to bind PPAR/RXR and be involved in transcriptional modulation of various genes by PPAR/RXR may call for updating the PPRE consensus sequence. As shown in Table 1, PPRE sequences consist of a direct repeat separated by one-nucleotide spacer (DR-1). However, only half of the nucleotides within each repeat sequence are strictly conserved, while others vary considerably. Hence, additional cis and trans parameters other than those dictated by the direct repeat and/or the PPAR•RXR heterodimer, respectively, are presumably involved in binding and transactivation mediated by the PPAR/RXR-PPRE transduction pathway. Indeed, in the enoyl-CoA hydratase (37.Zhang B. Marcus S.L. Miyata K.S. Subramani S. Capone J.P. Rachubinski R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12939-12945Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and the malic enzyme3 genes, half repeats adjacent to the PPRE direct repeat were shown to modulate PPAR/RXR binding to PPRE or transactivation of PPRE-promoted transcription. In two other cases (e.g. P450IV (12.Muerhoff A.S. Griffin K.J. Johnson E.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19051-19053Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and malic enzyme3), additional distant upstream promoter sequences were shown to be involved in modulating the PPAR effect. Furthermore, putative PPAR/RXR interacting proteins similar to those recently reported for the thyroid hormone nuclear receptor (39.Lee J.W. Choi H. Gywicz J. Brent R. Moore D. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 243-254Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) may modulate transcriptional activity driven by the PPAR-PPRE basal unit.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab Transcriptional suppression of Tf by HD/PP is essentially similar to that recently reported for the liver apolipoprotein C-III gene(17.Hertz R. Bishara-Shieban J. Bar-Tana J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13470-13475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). In both, the suppressive effect appears to be related to HNF-4-enhanced transcription of the concerned gene and to result from displacement of HNF-4 by PPAR/RXR from the HNF-4 element of the concerned gene together with HNF-4 suppression by HD/PP, resulting in its reduced liver availability. Transcriptional suppression by HD/PP therefore complements transcriptional transactivation induced by HD/PP, thus extending the scope of effects of HD/PP as pleiotropic gene modulators. Other HNF-4-activated genes should similarly be considered as candidates for transcriptional suppression by HD/PP. The functional significance of Tf suppression by xenobiotic HD/PP still remains to be investigated. Tf suppression could result in a decrease in iron availability and, if not compensated by increase in iron saturation or in Tf receptors, could lead to anemia. Slight anemia has indeed been observed in rats under conditions of subchromic treatment with HD/PP. 4J. Bar-Tana, unpublished observation. Since HNF-4 has recently been shown to mediate transcriptional activation of the erythropoietin gene by hypoxia(40.Galson D.L. Tsuchiya T. Tendler D.S. Huang L.E. Ren Y. Ogura T. Bunn H.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2135-2144Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar), Tf suppression by HD/PP could be complemented by erythropoietin suppression similarly mediated by the PPAR/RXR transduction pathway. Moreover, Tf ferric reduction catalyzed by the plasma membrane NADH reductase has recently been reported to initiate intracellular alkalinization and mitogenic growth (reviewed in (1.De Jong G. Van Dijk T.P. Van Eijk H.G. Clin. Chim. Acta. 1990; 190: 1-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar)). Tf suppression by endogenous activators of the PPAR-PPRE transduction pathway could therefore be biologically significant in differentiation processes modulated by Tf availability."

Cell. 1990; 63: 155-165Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar). The NF-1 dimers are stable and seem to be formed cotranslationally, and different NF-1 protein variants are able to heterodimerize(17.Kruse U. Sippel A.E. FEBS Lett. 1994; 348: 46-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). However, it is not known whether heterodimers occur in vivo. The various NF-1 proteins often mediate transcriptional activation but may also participate in the repression of genes in certain cellular contexts (18.Apt D. Liu Y. Bernard H.-U. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 3825-3833Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 19.Adams A.D. Choate D.M. Thompson M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6975-6983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The N-terminal domain, sufficient for DNA binding and dimerization, of all NF-1 proteins is highly conserved and contains four cysteine residues that are strictly required for DNA binding(20.Novak A. Goyal N. Gronostajski R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12986-12990Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This DNA-binding domain is not homologous to any of the other known classes of DNA-binding motifs such as the zinc fingers, leucine zippers, or helix-turn-helix motifs(11.Mermod N. O'Neill E.A. Kelly T.J. Tjian R. Cell. 1989; 58: 741-753Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar, 21.Meisterernst M. Rogge L. Foeckler R. Karaghiosoff M. Winnacker E.L. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 8191-8200Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). NF-1 binding sites are often positioned close to the binding site of other transcription factors in the regulatory region of many genes. In the retroviral MMTV promoter, an NF-1 binding site is localized in the −76/-60 DNA segment(1.Nowock J. Borgmeyer U. Püschel A.W. Rupp R.A.W. Sippel A.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1985; 13: 2045-2061Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 3.Buetti E. Kühnel B. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 190: 379-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), next to the −185/-79 DNA segment that contains four binding sites for the glucocorticoid receptor (GR)(22.Perlmann T. Eriksson P. Wrange Ö. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 17222-17229Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Transcription from the MMTV promoter is controlled by glucocorticoid hormone(23.Ringold G.M. Cardiff R.D. Varmus H.E. Yamamoto K.R. Cell. 1977; 10: 11-18Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), but the glucocorticoid-induced transcriptional response is reduced about 5-fold by a mutation in the NF-1 binding site(3.Buetti E. Kühnel B. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 190: 379-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). This hormone-dependent NF-1 enhancement might be explained by the observation that the NF-1 protein is not bound to its binding site in the silent MMTV promoter and that NF-1 binding depends on hormone activation of the promoter(24.Cordingley M.G. Riegel A.T. Hager G.L. Cell. 1987; 48: 261-270Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). This suggests that the constitutive DNA-binding protein NF-1, which is located in the cell nucleus, is prevented from binding to DNA by the specific chromatin organization in the MMTV promoter. In line with this hypothesis, chromatin remodelling of the MMTV promoter was shown to occur within minutes of hormone stimulation (25.Zaret K.S. Yamamoto K.R. Cell. 1984; 38: 29-38Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar) and to involve the rearrangement of a positioned nucleosome covering the −250/-60 DNA segment(26.Richard-Foy H. Hager G.L. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 2321-2328Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar), where GR and NF-1 bind. Further studies of the chromatin structure of the MMTV promoter in different cell lines and at different hormonal states have confirmed a strong correlation between NF-1 promoter occupancy and the degree of chromatin opening, the latter as measured by in situ restriction enzyme access(27.Archer T.K. Lee H.-L. Cordingley M.G. Mymryk J.S. Fragoso G. Berard D.S. Hager G.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 568-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 28.Mymryk J.S. Archer T.K. Genes & Dev. 1995; 9: 1366-1376Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In vitro studies involving the reconstitution of the GR and NF-1 binding DNA segment of the MMTV promoter into a nucleosome demonstrated that the DNA was rotationally positioned into a preferred rotational frame on the histone octamer surface. These studies showed that purified glucocorticoid receptor protein could bind to its target sequences in the nucleosome (29.Perlmann T. Wrange Ö. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 3073-3079Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar, 30.Piña B. Bruggemeier U. Beato M. Cell. 1990; 60: 719-731Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar, 31.Archer T.K. Cordingley M.G. Wolford R.G. Hager G.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 688-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar) while NF-1 was unable to bind to its nucleosomal target(30.Piña B. Bruggemeier U. Beato M. Cell. 1990; 60: 719-731Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar, 31.Archer T.K. Cordingley M.G. Wolford R.G. Hager G.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 688-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). In these studies the NF-1 binding DNA segment was rotationally positioned such that its two consecutive major grooves containing the recognition sequence for NF-1 faced the histone octamer(30.Piña B. Bruggemeier U. Beato M. Cell. 1990; 60: 719-731Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). Thus, there remain two explanations for the absence of NF-1 binding in the nucleosomally reconstituted MMTV promoter(32.Truss M.B.J. Hache R.S.G. Beato M. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1993; 47: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar): (i) the NF-1 protein is incapable of binding to its site in nucleosomal DNA irrespective of the nucleosomal positioning, or (ii) the inability of the NF-1 protein to bind is due to the particular position of the NF-1 site on the histone octamer in the MMTV promoter (see above). These two explanations have implications for how chromatin organization may restrict access of certain transcription factors. This restriction in access may in turn influence how gene induction is triggered by an inducible transcription factor such as GR and a constitutive DNA binding transcription factor such as NF-1. Here we address this issue by use of in vitro reconstituted nucleosomes in which a single NF-1 binding site is held in various well defined rotational and translational positions relative to the histone octamer. This positioning is achieved by placing the NF-1 binding site within a segment of DNA-bending sequence(33.Shrader T.E. Crothers D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 7418-7422Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). Our results show that the NF-1 protein binds with at least a 100-fold lower affinity to a nucleosomal DNA site than a corresponding site on free DNA. The rotational and translational positioning of the binding site on the nucleosome had no effect on the affinity of NF-1 for DNA. This is in contrast to GR, which binds to a nucleosomal glucocorticoid response element (GRE) with a high affinity if held in certain translational (34.Li Q. Wrange Ö. Genes & Dev. 1993; 7: 2471-2482Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) and rotational (35.Li Q. Wrange Ö. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4375-4384Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) positions. Thus, the lack of NF-1 binding to a nucleosome is an intrinsic property of the NF-1•DNA complex. These findings suggest how the organization of DNA into nucleosomes can be exploited in the cell to create DNA binding hierarchies for various classes of transcription factors. The construction of various plasmids containing a single transcription factor binding site within repeats of DNA-bending sequences has been described previously(34.Li Q. Wrange Ö. Genes & Dev. 1993; 7: 2471-2482Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Briefly, the plasmid pNo4 was constructed by consecutive cloning of a 30-bp DNA segment containing an NF-1 binding site, followed by four 20-bp DNA segments consisting of a DNA-bending sequence (referred to as the TG motif(33.Shrader T.E. Crothers D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 7418-7422Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar)) into the asymmetric AvaI site of pGem-Q2(34.Li Q. Wrange Ö.

Another construct, pNi4, differed from pNo4 in that the NF-1 binding site was moved 5 bp relative to the periodicity of the DNA-bending sequence (Fig. 1). No and Ni oligonucleotides contain the NF-1 site from the mouse mammary tumor virus promoter, at positions −77 to −63 (3.Buetti E. Kühnel B. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 190: 379-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), and they contain 15 bp of DNA-bending sequence(33.Shrader T.E. Crothers D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 7418-7422Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). We generated plasmids containing a 161-bp EcoRI/HindIII DNA insert, which was used for nucleosome reconstitution. This insert contained 157 bp of double-stranded DNA and four nucleotides of 5′-protruding single-stranded DNA at each end. The first nucleotide in the top strand, the EcoRI site, was given number 1. 2Nomenclature is as follows: No, NF-1 site with major grooves facing the periphery, i.e. o represents facing out; Ni, NF-1 site with major grooves facing the histone surface, i.e. i represents facing in; the number 4 in No4 and Ni4 signifies that four segments of 20-bp TG motif have been ligated at the 3′-side of the No and Ni segment. DNA labeling and fragment isolation were carried out as previously(34.Li Q. Wrange Ö. Genes & Dev. 1993; 7: 2471-2482Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Both nucleosome reconstitution with salt dilution and the following purification by glycerol gradient centrifugation were performed as described previously (29.Perlmann T. Wrange Ö. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 3073-3079Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar) with one modification, namely the final NaCl concentration after salt dilution was 0.13 M. Exonuclease III, DNase I footprinting, and dimethylsulfate methylation protection were performed as described (Refs. 34, 29, and 35, respectively). Quantification of NF-1 binding was done with PhosphorImager™ analysis and ImageQuant(™) software version 3.3 (Molecular Dynamics). Recombinant NF-1 protein was isolated from approximately 109 HeLa cells grown in roller flasks and infected with vaccinia virus that contained a full-length clone for NF-1 (36.Gounari F. De Francesco R. Schmitt J. van der Vliet P.C. Cortese R. Stunnenberg H. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 559-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) with six histidines fused to the N terminus (constructed and kindly provided by Drs. Jacky Schmitt and Hendrik Stunnenberg at EMBL, Heidelberg). The cells were harvested in phosphate-buffered saline using a rubber policeman, and subsequent steps were carried out at 4°C. Cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline and homogenized in 2 volumes of buffer A (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 5 mM MgCl2, 10 mM NaCl, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.2% aprotinin (Trasylol), 0.7 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.7 μg/ml pepstatin, 0.5 mM β-mercaptoethanol, 0.15 mM spermine, 0.5 mM spermidine) using a glass homogenizer (Kontes Glass Co., Vineland, NJ). The homogenate was transferred to a 50-ml centrifuge tube, and 5 M NaCl was added to achieve a final concentration of 0.4 M NaCl. The specimen was incubated for 20 min on ice and then centrifuged at 27,000 g for 30 min at 4°C using an SS-34 rotor in a Sorvall RC-5B centrifuge. The clear supernatant was incubated in a 50-ml Falcone tube with 2.5 ml of Ni2+-NTA-agarose (Qiagen), equilibrated with buffer B (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 2 mM MgCl2, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 mM β-mercaptoethanol, and 10% glycerol (v/v)) containing 4 mM imidazole, for 150 min at 4°C under constant mixing. The matrix was then transferred and packed into a small plastic column and washed with two column volumes of buffer B containing 4 mM imidazole and subsequently washed with two column volumes of buffer B containing 15 mM imidazole and with two column volumes of buffer B containing 30 mM imidazole. The recombinant NF-1 protein was then eluted with a linear gradient of 30-300 mM imidazole in buffer B with a total gradient volume of 60 ml. The amount of active NF-1 protein was determined in each fraction by DNase I footprinting. The peak fractions were pooled, glycerol and dithiothreitol were added to 15% (v/v) and 1 mM, respectively, and the specimen was stored at −110°C. The protein concentration in this preparation was less than 0.1 μg/μl(37.Bradford M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (209791) Google Scholar). We can estimate the purity of NF-1 protein that actively binds to DNA in these preparations using the following information: (i) 50% specific DNA binding in a DNase I footprinting assay (see below) is obtained with 10 nl of the preparation, and (ii) NF-1 binds DNA as a homodimer and has a molecular mass of 56.8 kDa (36.Gounari F. De Francesco R. Schmitt J. van der Vliet P.C. Cortese R. Stunnenberg H. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 559-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) and a dissociation constant of about 2 × 10-11M(38.Rawlings D.R. Rosenfeld P.J. Wides R.J. Challberg M.D. Kelly T.J. Cell. 1984; 37: 309-319Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) for specific DNA binding. We conclude that the purity of these preparations is at least 10% (w/w). One unit of NF-1 binding activity is defined as the amount of NF-1 protein required to saturate a specific DNA site to 50% in a DNase I footprinting assay containing 1.5 fmol of free DNA in an incubation volume of 40 μl. Rat liver nuclear extracts were used as an alternative source of NF-1 protein. Rat liver nuclei were purified as described before(39.Eriksson P. Wrange Ö. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 215: 505-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). The nuclear pellet was then extracted in 10 ml of buffer C (20 mM HEPES, pH 7.6, 25% (v/v) glycerol, 0.42 M NaCl, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 0.2 mM Na2EDTA, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.5 mM dithiothreitol) for 30 min at 0°C with occasional stirring, followed by centrifugation at 25,000 × g in an SS-34 Sorvall rotor at 4°C for 30 min. The clear supernatant was applied onto a 50-ml Sephadex G25 column (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) equilibrated in buffer D (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 10% glycerol, 0.2 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM dithiothreitol, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) containing 0.1 M KCl, and the macromolecular fraction was collected according to volume calibration with 10 ml of blue dextrane(™) (Pharmacia). The pool from the G25 column was clarified by centrifugation at 17,000 × g in an SS-34 Sorvall rotor at 4°C and then applied onto a 3.5-ml double-stranded DNA-cellulose column, equilibrated with buffer D containing 0.1 M KCl, at 0.12 ml/min, and then washed with two column volumes of buffer D containing 0.1 M KCl and then with two volumes of buffer D containing 0.15 M KCl. NF-1 was eluted with buffer D containing 0.35 M KCl. The salt concentration of the eluate was adjusted to 0.1 M KCl by the addition of buffer D without salt and then applied onto a 1-ml Mono Q column (Resource(™), Pharmacia) equilibrated with buffer D containing 0.1 M KCl. The column was eluted with a linear gradient of KCl from 0.1 M to 0.55 M in buffer D, total gradient volume 21 ml. NF-1 protein, assayed by DNase I footprinting, was eluted around 0.26 M KCl. Dithiothreitol was added to 5 mM, and NF-1 was stored at −110°C. Based on previous experience (34.Li Q. Wrange Ö. Genes & Dev. 1993; 7: 2471-2482Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) we constructed DNA fragments that were 161 bp long and contained a single NF-1 binding site. The NF-1 site was placed within a synthetic DNA-bending sequence having a 10-bp periodicity of (A/T)3NN(G/C)3NN, referred to as the TG motif (33.Shrader T.E. Crothers D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 7418-7422Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). This DNA sequence is known to direct rotational setting of DNA on a histone octamer such that A/T segments are located at sites of minor groove compression and G/C segments at sites of major groove compression(33.Shrader T.E. Crothers D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 7418-7422Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). We used this bending sequence to direct the rotational positioning of the 15-bp NF-1 binding DNA segment into two opposite rotational frames: No4, with the two consecutive major grooves of the two NF-1 half-sites facing toward the periphery of the nucleosome, and Ni4, with the two major grooves of the two half-sites facing toward the histone octamer protein surface (compare No and Ni in Fig. 1A). These DNA fragments contain the NF-1 binding sites (15 bp), 95 bp of TG-bending sequence, and 51 bp of flanking vector sequence (Fig. 1B). The rotational positioning of the NF-1 site in each reconstituted nucleosome was determined by DNase I footprinting. DNase I is known to cleave the DNA in the minor groove with higher efficiency where DNA is bent away from the enzyme cleavage site. Rotationally positioned nucleosomal DNA will thus generate a 10-bp DNase I ladder(40.Noll M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1974; 1: 1573-1578Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar, 41.Simpson R.T. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 1991; 40: 143-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). When we compared nucleosomal No4 and Ni4 DNA with their free counterpart there was a 10-bp periodicity of DNase I cutting with intervening segments of protection in the nucleosomal DNA (Fig. 2A). The staggering of DNase I cutting between the two strands was 2-4 bp, as expected for DNA that is wrapped around a histone octamer(42.Lutter L.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1978; 124: 391-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar) . Both No4 and Ni4 gave the same histone-induced 10-bp periodicity, indicating that they adopt the predicted rotational position: the major grooves of the NF-1 half-sites in No4 face the periphery, while the major grooves of NF-1 half sites in Ni4 face the histone octamer surface (Fig. 2B). The only differences between the DNase I cutting pattern of nucleosomal No4 and that of nucleosomal Ni4 were seen in the region containing the NF-1 binding site. These differences are due to different DNA sequences being located in the minor groove facing the periphery. The translational positions of the NF-1 sites in the two mononucleosomes were determined by exonuclease III protection analysis. Nucleosomal No4 and Ni4 gave similar exonuclease III patterns, showing that they adopt the same translational positioning (Fig. 3A). Full-length probe (position 161) was partially protected from exonuclease III digestion of the top strand in reconstituted nucleosomes for both No4 and Ni4. The first protected base on the bottom strand of nucleosomal No4 was at position 18, giving a 144-bp segment of protected DNA, as expected for nucleosomal DNA located in one strongly preferred translational position. The additional exonuclease III protections are caused by the previously described capacity of exonuclease III to digest DNA within a nucleosome, which gives rise to the characteristic 10-bp ladder (43.Riley D. Weintraub H. Cell. 1978; 13: 281-293Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) seen in Fig. 3A. In nucleosomal Ni4 the first stop in the bottom strand occurred at position 19. We conclude that nucleosomal No4 and Ni4 adopt the same rotational and translational position of the DNA-bending segment. The dyads of the NF-1 sites are positioned 50 and 45 bp from the nucleosome dyads in No4 and Ni4, respectively (Fig. 3B), in opposite rotational settings (Fig. 2B). Binding of NF-1 to DNA was measured by its ability to protect the N-7 position of two guanosines from methylation by dimethylsulfate. The binding affinity of NF-1 for an NF-1 site on free DNA was compared with its nucleosomal counterpart in both rotational orientations, No4 and Ni4. NF-1 protects a double G located 4 bp from the dyad on both strands of the NF-1 site from methylation by dimethylsulfate (10.de Vries E. van Driel W. van den Heuvel S.J.L. van der Vliet P.C. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 161-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A). Considerably higher concentrations of NF-1 protein were required to give partial protection from methylation for nucleosomal No4 and Ni4 than were required for free No4 and Ni4 (Fig. 4A). Only the bottom strand analysis is shown, but the result was the same for the top strand. Quantification of the dimethylsulfate methylation protection by PhosphorImager analysis (Fig. 4B) showed that a 100-fold higher NF-1 concentration was required to obtain 50% protection of the nucleosomal NF-1 site than was required for same site located in free DNA. NF-1 protects nucleosomal No4 and Ni4 to the same extent (Fig. 4B, compare nNo4 to nNi4). DNase I footprinting was also used to assay binding of NF-1 to free and nucleosomal DNA. A distinct footprint of NF-1 bound to free DNA was seen both for No4 and Ni4 (Fig. 5A, lanes 2-5 and 11-14). NF-1 bound to the corresponding nucleosomal DNA also gave protections over the NF-1 binding site both in No4 (Fig. 5A, lanes 7-9) and Ni4 (Fig. 5A, lanes 16-18). Quantification by PhosphorImager analysis of the NF-1 dependent DNase I protection showed that an approximately 300-fold higher concentration of NF-1 was required to obtain 50% protection of a nucleosomal NF-1 site than was required to obtain 50% protection of a binding site located on free DNA. In agreement with the dimethylsulfate methylation protection data, there was no difference in NF-1 binding affinity between nucleosomal No4 and Ni4 (Fig. 5B, compare nNo4 with nNi4). DNase I footprinting analyses of nucleosomal DNA also showed that NF-1 induced protection and hypersensitivity outside of the NF-1 binding region. This is probably caused by nonspecific interactions between protein and DNA since it also occurred in control experiments using nucleosomal DNA lacking an NF-1 site. The results described above were obtained using recombinant NF-1 protein expressed in vaccinia virus. A series of similar binding experiments were also performed using NF-1 protein that was partially purified from rat liver nuclear extracts. These extracts showed the same relative difference in affinity between a nucleosomal NF-1 site and a free NF-1 site (data not shown). The dyad of the NF-1 site in No4 is located 50 bp from the dyad of the nucleosome. We investigated whether moving the NF-1 site relative to the nucleosome dyad would have any influence on NF-1 affinity for nucleosomal DNA. An additional four DNA segments were constructed and reconstituted in vitro into nucleosomes. The position of the NF-1 site and the affinity of NF-1 for the site were measured as described above. These constructs and their nucleosomal organization are shown in Fig. 6: 1No3, where the dyad of the NF-1 site was located 30 bp from the nucleosome dyad; 2No2, where the dyad of the NF-1 site was located 10 bp from the nucleosome dyad; 3No1, where the dyad of the NF-1 site was located 20 bp from the nucleosome dyad; and 4No, where the NF-1 site was located either 40 or 30 bp from the nucleosome dyad (two alternative translational positions with the same rotational position). In all of these constructs the same extent of nucleosome-induced inhibition of NF-1 binding was observed as was observed for No4 and Ni4 (data not shown). We have shown for the first time that NF-1 cannot bind to its binding site within a nucleosome irrespective of the rotational and translational position of the binding site. The inability of NF-1 to bind to nucleosomal DNA is characteristic of NF-1. GR is perfectly capable of binding to a single GRE in the same nucleosome context as we have used in this study(34.Li Q. Wrange Ö. Genes & Dev. 1993; 7: 2471-2482Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 35.Li Q. Wrange Ö. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4375-4384Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The GR binding affinity to a nucleosomal GRE is often 2-3-fold lower than its free counterpart. There are, however, certain nucleosomal GRE positions where GR cannot bind. These positions are well defined, and the effects depend on the topology. For example, a GRE at the nucleosome dyad has high affinity for GR when oriented toward the periphery but becomes inaccessible when moved 5 bp relative to the TG motif(35.Li Q. Wrange Ö. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4375-4384Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). In the latter position, the major groove is rotated into the opposite direction, i.e. oriented toward the histone octamer. The inhibition of NF-1 binding to a nucleosomal binding site is in sharp contrast to GR binding to a nucleosomal GRE. Our binding data do not allow us to exclude the possibility that the nucleosome structure is locally perturbed during the NF-1 binding reaction. Thus it remains to be shown whether NF-1 is at all able to form a specific ternary complex with an intact nucleosome. Experiments that examine the protection from dimethylsulfate methylation have the advantage of detecting close protein-DNA contacts, and are thus highly specific. However, these experiments do not allow insight into the nucleosomal structure of the bound complex since dimethylsulfate methylation is uneffected by histone-DNA interaction. Conversely, the DNase I footprinting experiments reveal the typical 10-bp DNase I ladder, which is induced by the nucleosome structure, which should allow the parallel evaluation of specific NF-1 binding and nucleosome structure. However, the high concentration of NF-1 protein, which is required for DNase I protection in a nucleosomal NF-1 site also affects DNase I digestion outside of the NF-1 binding site. This is probably due to nonspecific binding of NF-1 to DNA and possibly the binding of other contaminating proteins present in our partially purified NF-1 preparations. This results in a progressively increased DNase I protection at the NF-1 site and a concomitant fading of the nucleosome-induced DNase I pattern. Thus it is not possible to determine whether the nucleosomes that generate the 10-bp ladder also contain one specifically bound NF-1 protein dimer. Nevertheless, we can still conclude that NF-1 has an at least 100-fold lower affinity for a nucleosomal NF-1 site than it has for an NF-1 site in free DNA. If the DNA organization in the nucleosome must be perturbed for NF-1 binding to occur, then the stability of each nucleosome, as determined by its DNA sequence, would be expected to affect NF-1 binding affinity. Although translational nucleosome positioning has been described in several promoters (for a review see (41.Simpson R.T. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 1991; 40: 143-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar)), little is known about the precision of this positioning at the base pair level(44.Bresnick E.H. Rories C. Hager G.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 865-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Our finding that the NF-1 protein cannot bind to a nucleosomal target 10-50 bp from the dyad shows that a precise nucleosome arrangement is not needed for the binding inhibition to occur. However, our experiments do not determine where the inhibition occurs relative to the nucleosome border. Attempts to position the NF-1 site further than 50 bp away from the nucleosome dyad failed due to problems with variability in translational position of the histone octamer caused by use of longer TG motif DNA. Cordingley et al.(24.Cordingley M.G. Riegel A.T. Hager G.L. Cell. 1987; 48: 261-270Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar) have observed that NF-1 occupancy of the MMTV promoter in vivo depends on the glucocorticoid hormone. This dependence can be simply explained by our results, which show that nucleosomal DNA is selectively inaccessible for NF-1 but not for GR(34.Li Q. Wrange Ö. Genes & Dev. 1993; 7: 2471-2482Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 35.Li Q. Wrange Ö. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4375-4384Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The modes of DNA binding of NF-1 and GR relative to histone/DNA arrangements in a nucleosome may explain the difference in selectivity. GR is known to form specific DNA contacts with two consecutive major grooves on the same side along the DNA axis(45.Scheidereit C. Beato M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 3029-3033Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 46.Eriksson P. Wrange Ö. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 3535-3542Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 47.Luisi B.F. Xu W.X. Otwinowski Z. Freedman L.P. Yamamoto K.R. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1991; 352: 497-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (1203) Google Scholar), apparently without any effect on the DNA structure(47.Luisi B.F. Xu W.X. Otwinowski Z. Freedman L.P. Yamamoto K.R. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1991; 352: 497-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (1203) Google Scholar). The NF-1 protein also forms specific DNA contacts with two consecutive major grooves along one side of the DNA length axis(10.de Vries E. van Driel W. van den Heuvel S.J.L. van der Vliet P.C. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 161-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). However, in contrast with GR, NF-1 binding to DNA has been reported to enhance a preformed bend in the DNA segment that flanks its binding site in the adenovirus terminal repeat(48.Zorbas H. Rogge L. Meisterernst M. Winnacker E.-L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 7735-7748Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Whether it is the NF-1-induced DNA structure, steric hindrance of the NF-1 protein as such, or some other feature of the NF-1•DNA complex that inhibits NF-1-nucleosome interaction remains to be investigated. We note that the TATA box binding protein is unable to bind DNA in a nucleosome(49.Imbalzano A.N. Kwon H. Green M.R. Kingston R.E. Nature. 1994; 370: 481-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar). In that case the reason may be the requirement of TATA box binding protein to form a sharp kink in DNA upon binding(50.Kim J. Nikolov D.B. Burley S.K. Nature. 1993; 365: 520-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (954) Google Scholar). Since NF-1 binding sites occur in many viral and cellular regulatory DNA segments, it is likely that the inhibition of NF-1 binding that is induced by the nucleosome is of functional significance also in other inducible promoters. One such case might be the CYP1A1 gene, where an Ah receptor, which binds dioxin, induces chromatin opening and NF-1 binding(9.Wu L. Whitlock J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 4811-4815Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). As described previously for the MMTV promoter(26.Richard-Foy H. Hager G.L. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 2321-2328Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar), the uninduced CYP1A1 promoter also contains positioned nucleosomes, some of which are perturbed by the dioxin-induced promoter activation(51.Morgan J.E. Whitlock J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11622-11626Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Another example is the liver-specific serum albumin enhancer, which contains three specifically positioned nucleosomes in liver cells where it is active(8.McPherson C.E. Shim E.-Y. Friedman D.S. Zaret K.S. Cell. 1993; 75: 387-398Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). One of the three nucleosomes is structurally perturbed and hypersensitive to DNase I. This perturbed nucleosome contains an NF-1 site and binding sites for liver-specific factors such as HNF3. The albumin enhancer is only occupied by NF-1 in liver cells where the enhancer is active, even though NF-1 is present in many tissues. McPherson et. al.(8.McPherson C.E. Shim E.-Y. Friedman D.S. Zaret K.S. Cell. 1993; 75: 387-398Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar) suggest that liver-specific factor(s) might induce the chromatin structure required for NF-1 to gain access to its binding site. A role of chromatin in gene regulation has been demonstrated in yeast cells by genetic interruption of histone H4 synthesis. This resulted in derepression of several previously silent genes(52.Durrin L.K. Mann R.K. Grunstein M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 1621-1629Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Likewise, titration of the histone pool in Xenopus oocytes by coinjection of competitive DNA resulted in a 10-fold decrease in nucleosome density of injected DNA. A parallel transcriptional activation of the MMTV promoter occurred independent of the glucocorticoid receptor(53.Perlmann T. Wrange Ö. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 5259-5265Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). These results suggest that one function of chromatin is to keep constitutively DNA binding transcription factors, such as NF-1 and TATA box binding protein, away from their targets in promoters that should be kept silent. Such a chromatin-dependent effect might be important for two reasons: (i) to avoid transcriptional leakage in promoters that should be inactive, and (ii) to reduce protein-DNA interaction in general and thereby direct the constitutive DNA binding transcription factors to the active promoters. This repressive function of chromatin suggests that induction of a previously silent promoter would require another class of transcription factors. This other class of factors would, in contrast to NF-1, possess the capacity to bind nucleosomal targets and to mediate chromatin remodelling. The remodelling would allow entry of the constitutively DNA binding factors. In this model, a gene that is reversibly regulated between a silent and an active state requires that the nucleosome binding activity of the inducing transcription factor be controllable, for example by ligand binding. This control mechanism has been seen for the GR and the Ah receptor. We thank Ulla Björk for skillful technical assistance. We are grateful to Drs.

https://openalex.org/W2064232231,"Bacteriophage N4 virion RNA polymerase transcription of double-stranded promoter-containing DNAs requires supercoiled template and E. coli single-stranded DNA–binding protein (EcoSSB); other single-stranded DNA–binding proteins cannot substitute. The DNA determinants of virion RNA polymerase binding at the promoter comprise a small template–strand hairpin. The requirement for EcoSSB is surprising, since single-stranded DNA–binding proteins destabilize hairpin structures. DNA footprinting of EcoSSB on wild-type and mutant promoters indicates that EcoSSB stabilizes the template–strand hairpin owing to the hairpin–loop sequences. Other single-stranded DNA–binding proteins destabilize the promoter hairpin, explaining the specificity of EcoSSB activation. We conclude that EcoSSB activates transcription by providing the appropriate DNA structure for polymerase binding. The existence of small hairpins stable to single-stranded protein binding suggests a novel mechanism that provides structural determinants for specific recognition in single-stranded DNA transactions by an otherwise nonspecific DNA-binding protein."
https://openalex.org/W1520549111,"Several types of cell exhibit cell surface protein kinase (ecto-PK) activities with Ser/Thr-specificity. Ecto-PK sharing certain characteristics of protein kinase CK2 can be detached from intact cells by interaction with exogenous substrates (Kübler, D., Pyerin, W., Burow, E., and Kinzel, V.(1983) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 80, 4021-4025). However, a detailed molecular analysis of this ecto-PK was hampered by the vanishingly small amounts of labile enzyme protein obtained by substrate-inducible enzyme release. We now describe the stabilization and enrichment of released ecto-PK by precipitation with polyethylene glycol followed by affinity chromatography on heparin-agarose. Ecto-PK is shown to consist of two separate forms released in tandem, ecto-PK I and ecto-PK II. Comparison with cell homogenates as well as cell surface biotinylation experiments excluded contamination with intracellular PK. Purified ecto-PK I and ecto-PK II exhibit respectively selective phosphorylation of CK1- and CK2-specific peptide substrates, a complementary sensitivity to inhibitory agents and a differential use of the cosubstrates ATP and GTP. Ecto-PK I consists of a 40-kDa moiety; the ecto-PK II is an ensemble of three components of 43- and 40-kDa (catalytic subunits) and a noncatalytic 28-kDa subunit. In addition, components of the ecto-PK II react with CK2-specific antibodies. Further, comparative peptide mapping and the results of mass spectrometry in combination with assignment of amino acid sequences confirmed that ecto-PK II is closely related if not identical to the protein kinase CK2. Assays with intact cells that result in the phosphorylation of a variety of endogenous membrane proteins showed that both ecto-PKs participate, and further, certain ecto-PK substrates become preferentially labeled by one or another of the enzymes, whereas others are phosphorylated by both ecto-PK activities. Several types of cell exhibit cell surface protein kinase (ecto-PK) activities with Ser/Thr-specificity. Ecto-PK sharing certain characteristics of protein kinase CK2 can be detached from intact cells by interaction with exogenous substrates (Kübler, D., Pyerin, W., Burow, E., and Kinzel, V.(1983) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 80, 4021-4025). However, a detailed molecular analysis of this ecto-PK was hampered by the vanishingly small amounts of labile enzyme protein obtained by substrate-inducible enzyme release. We now describe the stabilization and enrichment of released ecto-PK by precipitation with polyethylene glycol followed by affinity chromatography on heparin-agarose. Ecto-PK is shown to consist of two separate forms released in tandem, ecto-PK I and ecto-PK II. Comparison with cell homogenates as well as cell surface biotinylation experiments excluded contamination with intracellular PK. Purified ecto-PK I and ecto-PK II exhibit respectively selective phosphorylation of CK1- and CK2-specific peptide substrates, a complementary sensitivity to inhibitory agents and a differential use of the cosubstrates ATP and GTP. Ecto-PK I consists of a 40-kDa moiety; the ecto-PK II is an ensemble of three components of 43- and 40-kDa (catalytic subunits) and a noncatalytic 28-kDa subunit. In addition, components of the ecto-PK II react with CK2-specific antibodies. Further, comparative peptide mapping and the results of mass spectrometry in combination with assignment of amino acid sequences confirmed that ecto-PK II is closely related if not identical to the protein kinase CK2. Assays with intact cells that result in the phosphorylation of a variety of endogenous membrane proteins showed that both ecto-PKs participate, and further, certain ecto-PK substrates become preferentially labeled by one or another of the enzymes, whereas others are phosphorylated by both ecto-PK activities."

Biol. Chem. 267, 19992-20001). In the present study, we demonstrate that a similar transacetylase can transfer the acetate group from PAF to sphingosine forming N-acetylsphingosine (C2-ceramide). The chemical structure of the reaction product, C2-ceramide, was established by its identical Rf value with authentic C2-ceramide standard on thin-layer plate, sensitivity to acid treatment, resistance to alkaline hydrolysis, and ability to form the C2-ceramide dibenzoate derivative. Nonspecific transfer of the acetate from PAF to sphingosine in the absence of enzyme and nonlinearity of the reaction rates were rectified by complexing sphingosine to bovine serum albumin in a 1:1 molar ratio. Under these conditions, the apparent Km for PAF is 5.4 μM, which is in the same range as the Km (12.0 μM) when lysoplasmalogen is the acetate acceptor. PAF:sphingosine transacetylase has a narrow substrate specificity and strict stereochemical configuration requirements. Ceramide, sphingosylphosphocholine, stearylamine, sphingosine 1-phosphate, or sphingomyelin are not substrates, whereas sphinganine has a limited capacity to accept the acetate from PAF. Also, only the naturally synthesized D-erythroisomer but not the synthetic L-erythro-, D-threo-, or L-threoisomers of sphingosine can serve as a substrate. PAF transacetylase activity is widely distributed among several tissues and may involve histidine and cysteine for its catalytic activity due to inhibitory effects to the enzyme by diethyl pyrocarbonate and N-ethylmaleimide, respectively. C2-ceramide is produced via PAF:sphingosine transacetylase, and physiological levels of C2-ceramide are detected in both undifferentiated and differentiated intact HL-60 cells. Collectively, because C2-ceramide has many biological activities that differ from that of PAF and sphingosine, the CoA-independent, PAF-dependent transacetylase serves as a modifier of PAF, and sphingosine functions by generating a variant lipid mediator, C2-ceramide.

The OrfAB transframe protein that is IS3 transposase is produced by −1 translational frameshifting between orfA and orfB. Efficient production of the IS3 transposase in the cells harboring the IS3-carrying plasmid has been shown to generate miniplasmids as well as characteristic minicircles, called IS3 circles, consisting of the entire IS3 sequence and one of the 3-base pair sequences flanking IS3 in the parental plasmid. Here, we show that the IS3 transposase also generates the linear molecules of IS3 with 3-nucleotide overhangs at the 5′-ends. The nucleotide sequences of the overhangs are the same as those flanking IS3 in the parental plasmid, suggesting that the linear IS3 molecules are generated from the parental plasmid DNA by staggered double strand breaks at the end regions of IS3.

The linear IS3 molecules are likely to be the early intermediates in the transposition reaction, which proceeds in a non-replicative manner. Transposable elements are characterized by their ability to transpose, and many of such elements have been identified so far in plasmids and chromosomes of a wide variety of organisms. IS3 (1258 bp 1The abbreviations used are: bpbase pair(s)IRLleft terminal inverted repeatIRRright terminal inverted repeatkbkilobase pairsntnucleotide(s)dNTPdATP, dTTP, dGTP, or dTTPorfopen reading frame. in length) is an insertion element present in the Escherichia coli chromosome and in plasmid F (Malamy et al., 1972; Hu et al., 1975; Deonier et al., 1979; Timmerman and Tu, 1985; Umeda and Ohtsubo, 1989). IS3 does not mediate cointegration and is thus supposed to transpose in a non-replicative manner (Sekine et al., 1994). This element has imperfect inverted repeats (IRL and IRR) of 39 bp at its terminal regions and encodes two open reading frames, orfA and orfB, which are in phase 0 and −1, respectively, and overlap each other (Timmerman and Tu, 1985; Fayet et al., 1990; Sekine and Ohtsubo, 1991). In addition to the OrfA and OrfB proteins, which are produced from each of the two orfs, a transframe protein (the OrfAB protein) that is IS3 transposase is produced by −1 translational frameshifting at the A4G motif present in the overlapping region between the two orfs (Sekine et al., 1994). An IS3 mutant with a single guanine insertion in the A4G motif to give A4G2 produces the transposase protein without frameshifting. This mutant causes a deletion of a sequence adjacent to IS3 in a plasmid to produce miniplasmids and generation of characteristic minicircles, called IS3 circles, which consist of the entire IS3 sequence and a 3-bp sequence intervening between the IS3 ends (Sekine et al., 1994). The orfB frame of IS3 codes for a polypeptide segment showing homology with a conserved amino acid sequence motif found in retrovirus and retrotransposon integrases (Fayet et al., 1990; Khan et al., 1991), while the orfA frame codes for a polypeptide segment with the α helix-turn-α helix motif, which may be involved in recognition of the IS3 end regions (Prère et al., 1990; Sekine and Ohtsubo, 1991). A group of IS elements that are structurally related to IS3 have been isolated from diverse bacterial genera. These elements, called the IS3 family (Schwartz et al., 1988), code for two orfs in phase 0 and −1, respectively (Fayet et al., 1990; Sekine and Ohtsubo, 1991), and the predicted amino acid sequences encoded by the downstream orf are similar to one another and have homology with the motif in retrovirus/retrotransposon integrases (Fayet et al., 1990; Khan et al., 1991). In addition to IS3, two other members of the family produce transposases by frameshifting between the two orfs (Vögele et al., 1991; Polard et al., 1992). base pair(s) left terminal inverted repeat right terminal inverted repeat kilobase pairs nucleotide(s) dATP, dTTP, dGTP, or dTTP open reading frame. Here, we report that IS3 transposase generates linear IS3 molecules in addition to miniplasmids and IS3 circles. The molecules have 5′-overhangs, suggesting that they are generated from the parental plasmid DNA carrying IS3 directly by staggered breaks. We point out that the transposition reaction in IS3 is similar to the transposition reaction in other transposons, such as Tn10 and Tn7, which occurs by a non-replicative mechanism (Morisato and Kleckner, 1984; Benjamin and Kleckner, 1989; Bainton et al., 1991), and even more to the integration reaction in retroviruses, which generate linear DNA molecules as well as characteristic circles with long terminal repeat sequences. Bacterial strains used were E. coli K12 derivatives MV1184 (Vieira and Messing, 1987) and YK1100 (Wada et al., 1988). Plasmids pSEK183 and pSEK1831 used were pUC118 derivatives and carry wild type IS3 and an IS3 mutant, IS3-1, respectively (Sekine et al., 1994). IS3-1 contains a guanine insertion in the A4G motif at nt 328-332 by the coordinates given to the IS3 sequence (Timmerman and Tu, 1985), leading to in-frame alignment of orfA and orfB. Plasmid pSEK1832 belongs to type I miniplasmids derived from pSEK1831 and is deleted for the region (1018 bp) extending from the end of IRR to a site within the IG region in pSEK1831 (Sekine et al., 1994). Culture media used were L broth and L rich broth (Yoshioka et al., 1987). L-agar plates contained 1.5% (w/v) agar (Eiken) in L broth. Antibiotics were added in L-agar plates, when necessary, at the concentration of 100 μg of ampicillin (Wako)/ml and 30 μg of chloramphenicol (Sigma)/ml. Enzymes used were: T4 polynucleotide kinase, exonuclease III, restriction endonuclease MluI, bacterial alkaline phosphatase, and DNA polymerase I (Klenow fragment) (Takara); λ exonuclease (Life Technologies, Inc.); restriction endonucleases, BsmI and NcoI (New England Biolabs); and modified T7 DNA polymerase (Sequenase, U. S. Biochemical Corp.). Reagents and chemicals used were: [γ-32P]ATP (222 TBq/mmol) and [α-32P]dNTP (110 TBq/mmol) (Amersham Corp.); dNTPs and agarose (Takara); polyacrylamide (Wako). DNA was prepared from the E. coli cells grown in L rich broth. The alkaline lysis method (Sambrook et al., 1989) was used to prepare plasmid DNA for cloning and nucleotide sequencing. Small scale preparation of DNA for detection of the linear IS3 molecules was performed under the neutral condition as described by He et al.(1990). Large scale preparation of the linear IS3 molecules was carried out as follows. Strain MV1184 harboring pSEK1831 or pSEK1832 was grown in 500 ml of L rich broth overnight at 37°C. The cells were collected and lysed by the method of Clewell and Helinski(1970). The DNA was separated by CsCl/ethidium bromide equilibrium density centrifugation (Sambrook et al., 1989), and the upper band DNA containing linear DNA molecules and nicked circular plasmid DNA were collected. The DNA preparation was then separated by electrophoresis in a 1.2% agarose gel, and the band of the linear IS3 molecules was cut out and eluted. Oligonucleotides were synthesized using a DNA synthesizer model 392 (Applied Biosystems) and were labeled, if necessary, at their 5′-ends using T4 polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP. Nucleotide sequences were determined by the dideoxynucleotide method (Sanger et al., 1977; Messing, 1983) using the Sequenase DNA sequencing kit (U. S. Biochemical Corp.) following the recommendations of the manufacturer. The 5′-ends of the linear IS3 molecules were analyzed by primer extension as follows. The linear IS3 molecules (0.02 pmol) were isolated from strain MV1184 harboring pSEK1831 as described above, and the 32P-labeled oligonucleotides (0.02 pmol) were annealed in the buffer containing 7 mM Tris•HCl (pH 7.5), 0.1 mM EDTA, 20 mM NaCl, and 7 mM MgCl2. The reaction was carried out in the presence of dNTPs (0.2 mM each) and 0.1 unit of DNA polymerase I (Klenow fragment) for 40 min at 37°C and stopped by adding formamide to a final 30% concentration (v/v). Primers used were L and R (see Table 1). Size markers appearing as sequence ladders were prepared using the 32P-labeled L or R primer and the pSEK183 DNA as template. The DNA chains were separated on 8% polyacrylamide sequencing gels containing 7 M urea.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab The 3′-ends of the linear IS3 molecules were analyzed as follows. The linear IS3 molecules were isolated from strain MV1184 harboring pSEK1831 as described above. In one reaction, the linear IS3 molecules (0.01 pmol) were digested with BsmI or NcoI, treated with bacterial alkaline phosphatase, and labeled with [γ-32P]ATP. In the other reaction, the linear IS3 molecules were treated with bacterial alkaline phosphatase, labeled with 32P at their 5′-ends, and then digested with BsmI or NcoI. The samples so prepared were alkaline-denatured and electrophoresed in 8% polyacrylamide sequencing gels containing 7 M urea. Size markers appearing as sequence ladders were prepared using the pSEK183 DNA as template and the 32P-labeled BsmI or NcoI primer (see Table 1). The linear IS3 molecules were isolated from strain MV1184 harboring pSEK1832, as described above. Seven μl of the buffer (27 mM Tris•HCl, pH 7.5, 33 mM NaCl, 13 mM MgCl2, 6.7 mM dithiothreitol) containing the linear IS3 molecules (0.01 pmol) was mixed with 0.5 μl of [α-32P]dNTP in the presence or absence of 0.2 μM dNTP. A 1.6 unit of modified T7 DNA polymerase (Sequenase) was then added and incubated for 5 min at 37°C. The samples were treated with BsmI or NcoI, heat-denatured, and then electrophoresed in 8% polyacrylamide sequencing gels containing 7 M urea. Size markers appearing as sequence ladders were prepared using the pSEK1832 DNA as template and the 32P-labeled BsmI or NcoI primer (see Table 1). We have previously demonstrated that plasmid pSEK1831 carrying an IS3 mutant (IS3-1) with a guanine insertion in the A4G motif to give A4G2 generates major six types of small closed circular molecules (named I-VI in order of their sizes) (Fig. 1Aa, lane 1) due to the efficient production of IS3 transposase from the mutant without frameshifting (Sekine et al., 1994). Structural analyses of these molecules have revealed that type I-IV molecules are miniplasmids and type V molecules are minicircles lacking the region required for replication of the plasmid. These miniplasmids and minicircles are produced by deletion of a sequence adjacent to IS3. Most of the type VI molecules are IS3 circles, which consist of the entire IS3 sequence and a 3-bp sequence intervening between the IS3 ends (Sekine et al., 1994). All these molecules were identified in the DNA sample prepared under the alkaline condition from the cleared cell lysate. Here, we prepared the DNA sample under the neutral condition and found that the sample contained all types of molecules previously identified, in which, however, the band of the molecules corresponding to type V minicircles was denser than that in the sample prepared under the alkaline condition (Fig. 1Aa, lane 2). The DNA molecules migrated even faster than the IS3 circles (type VI molecules) and formed a distinct band in a polyacrylamide gel (Fig. 1Ba, lane 2; Fig. 1Bb, lane 1). When the DNA sample prepared under the neutral condition was treated with E. coli exonuclease III, such molecules disappeared, while the other molecules did not (Fig. 1Ab, lane 2; Fig. 1Bb, lane 2). This shows that these molecules are linear DNA fragments with the 5′ protruding or blunt ends that can be digested with E. coli exonuclease III. When the DNA sample was treated with λ exonuclease, the linear molecules also disappeared (Fig. 1Ab, lane 3), showing that the linear DNA fragments have the 5′-ends with phosphate residues that can be digested with λ exonuclease. The linear molecules are approximately 1.3 kb in length, as estimated from their electrophoretic mobility. This size is almost the same as that of the IS3 sequence (1,258 bp). When the DNA sample prepared under the neutral condition was digested with MluI, which cleaves the IS3 sequence at one site, there appeared two bands of DNA fragments, about 0.8 and 0.5 kb in length (see the bands indicated by open arrowheads in Fig. 1Bb, lane 3). Such DNA fragments were not contained in the DNA sample treated with exonuclease III, followed by digestion with MluI (see Fig. 1Bb, lane 4). The sizes of the two fragments are the expected ones of the MluI-digested IS3 sequence, which are 0.78 and 0.48 kb in length, suggesting strongly that the molecules identified above are the linear IS3 molecules. Note here that MluI digestion resulted in a shift of the position of the band corresponding to IS3 circles (type VI molecules) to the position where the linear IS3 molecules were originally present, due to conversion from the circular form to the linear form of the IS3 circles (Fig. 1Ab, lane 4; Fig. 1Bb, lanes 3 and 4). The linear IS3 molecules as well as small circular molecules including IS3 circles were not detected in the DNA sample prepared under either the alkaline or neutral condition from the cleared lysate of cells harboring pSEK183 carrying wild type IS3 (Fig. 1Aa, lanes 3 and 4; Fig. 1Ba, lanes 3 and 4), demonstrating that all these molecules are generated by the action of the IS3 transposase. The linear IS3 molecules in the DNA sample prepared under the neutral condition from the cells harboring pSEK1831 were purified by ultracentrifugation, followed by agarose gel electrophoresis (see “Materials and Methods”). The 5′-ends of the molecules were then analyzed by primer extension using oligonucleotide primers, L and R (Table 1), which hybridize with the IS3 end regions, IRL and IRR, respectively, and prime DNA synthesis toward the outside of IS3 (Fig. 2A). The extension product from the L primer labeled with 32P at its 5′-end was 55 nt, which is 3 nt longer than the extension product terminating at the exact end of IRL of IS3 (Fig. 2Ba), whereas the extension product from the R primer labeled at its 5′-end was 55 nt, 3 nt longer than the extension product terminating at the exact end of IRR (Fig. 2Bb). These results show that the linear IS3 molecules have a 3-nt sequence at the 5′-ends of IS3. To determine the 3′-ends at IRL of the linear IS3 molecules, the molecules were digested with BsmI, which cleaves IS3 at one site, and the fragments containing IRL were isolated by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and labeled with 32P at their 5′-ends (see Fig. 3A, strategy I). After denaturation and electrophoresis of the fragments in a sequencing gel, we detected two bands of single-stranded DNA fragments (Fig. 3Ba, lane 1). The small DNA fragment is supposed to correspond to the fragment, whose 3′-end is the IRL-proximal end of the linear IS3 molecule and whose 5′-end is labeled with 32P at the BsmI site (Fig. 3A, strategy I). The large fragment is supposed to be the fragment with a 3-nt sequence attached to the 5′-end of IRL (Fig. 3A, strategy I). To confirm this, the linear IS3 molecules were labeled with 32P at their 5′-ends and then digested with BsmI (Fig. 3A, strategy II), and the DNA sample was denatured and electrophoresed in a sequencing gel. The large fragment was generated, but the small one was not (Fig. 3Ba, lane 2), confirming the assumption above. The small fragment was determined precisely by the size markers to be 105 nt long (Fig. 3Ba), indicating that the 3′-end at IRL of the linear IS3 molecules is the 3′-end of the IS3 sequence. To determine the 3′-ends at IRR of the linear IS3 molecules, the fragments containing IRR were isolated after digestion of the molecules with NcoI, which cleaves IS3 at one site, and labeled with 32P at their 5′-ends (see Fig. 3A, strategy I). After denaturation of the sample and electrophoresis of the fragments in a sequencing gel, we detected two bands of single-stranded DNA fragments (Fig. 3Bb, lane 1). The large DNA fragment is supposed to correspond to the fragment, whose 3′-end is the IRR-proximal end of the linear IS3 molecules and whose 5′-end is labeled with 32P at the NcoI site. The small fragment is supposed to be the fragment with a 3-nt sequence attached to the 5′-end of IRR (Fig. 3A, strategy I). To confirm this, the linear IS3 molecules were labeled with 32P at their 5′-ends and then digested with NcoI (Fig. 3A, strategy II), and the DNA sample was denatured and electrophoresed in a sequencing gel. The small fragment was generated, but the large one was not (Fig. 3Bb, lane 2), confirming the assumption above. The large fragment was determined precisely by size markers to be 171 nt long (Fig. 3Bb), indicating that the 3′-end at IRR of the linear IS3 molecules is the 3′-end of the IS3 sequence. This and the result obtained above show that the linear molecules have 3-nt overhangs at the 5′-ends of the IS3 sequence. Plasmid pSEK1831 used here carries IS3, which is flanked by the same sequences, 5′-AGC-3′/3′-TCG-5′, that are the target sequence duplicated upon IS3 insertion (Sekine et al., 1994). It is possible that the 3-nt overhangs are the target sequence. Plasmid pSEK1832 is a type I miniplasmid derived from pSEK1831 by deletion in a region immediately adjacent to IRR, and thus the IS3 sequence in pSEK1832 is flanked by the sequence 5′-TCC-3′/3′-AGG-5′ at IRR, which is different from that in the parental plasmid, and the sequence 5′-AGC-3′/3′-TCG-5′ at IRL, which is the same as that in the parental plasmid (Sekine et al., 1994). Note that pSEK1832 generates the molecules corresponding to linear IS3 molecules, IS3 circles, and even smaller miniplasmids (type II ~ IV) (Fig. 1Aa, lanes 5 and 6). To know whether the linear molecules observed are of IS3 with 3-nt overhangs at the 5′-ends of IRR and IRL, which are supposed to be 5′-TCC-3′ and 5′-AGC-3′, respectively, we carried out sequencing analysis as follows. To determine the nucleotide sequence of the overhangs attached to the 5′-end of IRL, the linear IS3 molecules were first incubated with a modified T7 DNA polymerase (Sequenase), which lacks the 3′ → 5′-exonuclease activity, in the presence of [α-32P]dNTP. The DNA sample obtained was digested with BsmI, heat-denatured, and electrophoresed in a sequencing gel. As shown in Fig. 4A, a single-stranded DNA fragment, 106 nt in length, with an extension of 1 nt from the 3′-end of IRL was generated in the presence of [α-32P]dGTP but was not in the presence of either [α-32P]dATP, [α-32P]dTTP, or [α-32P]dCTP. This shows that only dGTP was incorporated and thus that the nucleotide next to the 5′-end of IRL in the 3-nt overhang is dC. Next, when the linear IS3 molecules were incubated in the presence of [α-32P]dGTP plus dATP or dTTP, the BsmI digestion of the sample did not generate any fragments larger than the fragment (106 nt) that was generated in the presence of [α-32P]dGTP alone (Fig. 4A). However, in this experiment, when dCTP was added instead of dATP or dTTP, BsmI digestion generated the 107-nt fragment, 1 nt larger than the 106-nt fragment (Fig. 4A). This shows that dCTP is incorporated after dGTP and thus that the nucleotide at the middle position in the 3-nt overhang is dG. Finally, when the linear IS3 molecules were incubated in the presence of dTTP in addition to [α-32P]dGTP and dCTP, BsmI digestion of the sample generated the 108-nt fragment, 1 nt larger than the product (107 nt) that was generated in the presence of [α-32P]dGTP and dCTP (Fig. 4A). However, in this experiment, when dATP was added instead of dTTP, BsmI digestion did not generate such extension products (Fig. 4A). This shows that dTTP was incorporated after dGTP and dCTP and thus that the nucleotide at the 5′-end position in the 3-nt overhang is dA. All of these results show that the nucleotide sequence of the overhang attached to the 5′-end of IRL is 5′-AGC-3′. Note that this sequence is identical to the sequence flanking IRL of IS3 in the parental plasmid pSEK1832. To determine the nucleotide sequence of the 3-nt overhang at the 5′-end of IRR, the linear IS3 molecules isolated were incubated with Sequenase in the presence of [α-32P]dNTP and digested with NcoI, which cleaves IS3 at one site. In the presence of [α-32P]dGTP, NcoI digestion generated an extension product, 173 nt in length, 2 nt longer than that with the exact 3′-end of IRR (Fig. 4B). In the presence of [α-32P]dCTP or [α-32P]dTTP, NcoI digestion did not generate such extension products, but in the presence of [α-32P]dATP, NcoI digestion gave rise to two faint bands of the fragments, 172 and 173 nt in length (Fig. 4B). These results show that the nucleotide(s) next to the 5′-end of IRR in the linear IS3 molecules is dCC, dTT, or dT and that the molecules with the overhanging sequence dCC are major. When the linear IS3 fragments were incubated in the presence of [α-32P]dGTP plus dATP, an extension product, 174 nt in length, 1 bp longer than that generated in the presence of [α-32P]dGTP alone, and in addition, another extension product, 173 nt in length, forming a faint band, were generated (Fig. 4B). In this experiment, when dTTP or dCTP was added instead of dATP, the extension product of 173 nt long was generated, but the extension product of 174 nt long was not (Fig. 4B). However, when the three nucleotides, dCTP, dTTP, and dATP, were added in the presence of [α-32P]dGTP, the extension product, 174 nt in length, was generated (Fig. 4B). These results show that the nucleotide sequence of the overhang at the 5′-end of IRR in the major linear IS3 molecules is 5′-TCC-3′ and that in the minor ones is either 5′-VTT-3′ (where V is A or G or C) or 5′-RCT-3′ (where R is A or G), etc. Note that the overhanging sequence 5′-TCC-3′ is identical to the sequence adjacent to IRR in the parental plasmid pSEK1832. We will discuss later the reason the linear fragments with overhanging sequences other than 5′-TCC-3′ are generated. We have shown in this paper that the efficient production of IS3 transposase results in generation of the linear IS3 molecules having 5′-ends with overhanging sequences of 3 nt. Nucleotide sequences of the 3-nt overhangs of the major linear IS3 molecules generated from pSEK1832 are identical to those flanking IS3 in the parental plasmid. This result indicates that the linear molecules are excised from the parental plasmid by staggered breaks at both end regions of IS3 by the action of the transposase. In transposons Tn10 and Tn7, which transpose in a non-replicative manner, double strand breaks occur at both end regions of the elements to excise the linear transposon fragments, which are subsequently inserted into a target site (Morisato and Kleckner, 1984; Benjamin and Kleckner, 1989; Bainton et al., 1991). Identification and characterization of the linear IS3 molecules further support the previous notion that IS3 transposes in a non-replicative manner (Sekine et al., 1994). As described under “Results,” some of the linear IS3 molecules were found to have the 3-nt overhanging sequences different from those flanking IS3 in the parental plasmid. We have observed here and previously (Sekine et al., 1994) that IS3 mediates deletion frequently in the region adjacent to IRR of IS3 to produce miniplasmids, which now have IS3 flanked by different sequences, and that these miniplasmids still generate many kinds of smaller miniplasmids. It is therefore quite likely that the linear IS3 molecules with different overhanging sequences were generated by excision from the smaller miniplasmids. It should be noted that unlike Tn10 and Tn7, IS3 generates IS3 circles consisting of the entire IS3 sequence and a 3-bp sequence intervening between the IS3 ends (Sekine et al., 1994) (Fig. 5). Most of the IS3 circles contain the intervening 3-bp sequence, which is identical to either one of the sequences flanking IS3 in the parental plasmid, but others contain the 3-bp sequence different from the original sequences flanking IS3. The latter IS3 circles are supposed to be produced from miniplasmids with a flanking sequence different from that in the parental plasmid. It is likely that these IS3 circles are derived by circularization of the linear IS3 molecules (Fig. 5), such that only one 3′-end of IS3 is joined to the 5′-end of the 3-nt overhanging sequence on the other side, and the resulting 3-nt gap on the opposite strand is subsequently converted to a homoduplex form through DNA repair. Alternatively, both 3′-ends of IS3 are joined with the 5′-ends of the 3-nt overhanging sequence on the other side to give circles with a 3-bp heteroduplex sequence intervening between IRL and IRR. (If the 3-bp sequences flanking IS3 are identical, the circles should have a homoduplex sequence intervening between IRs.) The IS3 circles with the sequence of one or the other strand could have been obtained by cloning. It is not clear at present whether the IS3 circles participate as substrates in transposition or not. Polard et al.(1992) have reported that an IS3 family element, IS911, also generates IS circles similar to the IS3 circles and that the IS911 circles are, however, not the obligatory transposition intermediates. As described above, IS3 generates both circular and linear molecules, while Tn10 and Tn7 generate linear molecules but not circles. Retroviruses are, however, known to generate circular DNAs with two long terminal repeats in addition to double-stranded linear DNA molecules after reverse transcription from the viral RNA genome (Varmus and Brown, 1989) (Fig. 5). In this respect, IS3 resembles retroviruses. The linear molecules of retroviruses are considered to be the intermediates for their integration, in which 2 nt from each 3′-end of the linear viral DNA are removed by integrase to produce 5′-protruding ends (Craigie et al., 1990; Katz et al., 1990; Katzman et al., 1989; Sherman and Fyfe, 1990), and the 3′-ends of the linear molecules are subsequently joined to the 5′-ends generated at a target site (Fujiwara and Mizuuchi, 1988; Brown et al., 1989) (Fig. 5). Considering the conservation of the amino acid sequence motif in transposases of IS3 family elements and retroviral integrases, we assume that the linear IS3 molecules are the transposition intermediates and are inserted into a target site by a similar mechanism to that in the retroviral system. Probably, the 3′-OH of the linear IS3 molecule is joined to 5′-P of the target DNA, which is supposed to be generated by 3-bp staggered breaks (Fig. 5), since IS3 has been shown to give a 3-bp target duplication at its point of insertion (Sommer et al., 1979; Timmerman and Tu, 1985; Yoshioka et al., 1987; Spielmann-Ryser et al., 1991). The 3-nt gap on the opposite strand is subsequently repaired to convert the gap to a duplex form and to remove the 3-nt donor sequence attached to the 5′-end of the linear IS3 molecule (Fig. 5). The linear IS3 molecules are accumulated to a level that can be readily detected in the DNA preparation from a small overnight culture by gel electrophoresis and staining the gel with ethidium bromide. This may imply that the ends of the linear IS3 molecules are protected from the attack of cellular nucleases. In Tn10, there exists such a protein-DNA complex, which is an active form of transposition intermediate (Haniford et al., 1991). It is likely that a gapped donor molecule, i.e. a donor backbone, is produced when IS3 has been excised. We have, in fact, detected such donor backbone molecules in the DNA sample in a smaller amount than that of the linear IS3 molecules. 2K. Izumi, Y. Sekine, and E. Ohtsubo, unpublished results. This suggests that the donor backbone molecules released do not form a protein-DNA complex and are thus subjected to the attack of nucleases unlike the linear IS3 molecules."

INTRODUCTIONThe molecular chaperones are a class of proteins that have been shown to facilitate the in vivo folding and transport of nascent polypeptides(1.Gething M.-J. Sambrook J. Nature. 1992; 355: 33-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (3574) Google Scholar, 2.Ellis R.J. van der Vies S.M. Hemmingsen S.M. Biochem. Soc. Symp. 1990; 55: 145-153Google Scholar). The chaperonins, one class of molecular chaperones, have been found in prokaryotes, mitochondria, and chloroplasts(3.Hemmingsen S.M. Woolford C. van der Vies S.M. Tilly K. Dennis D.T. Georgopoulos C.P. Hendrix R.W. Ellis R.J. Nature. 1988; 333: 330-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (919) Google Scholar). One widely studied chaperonin from Escherichia coli, GroEL, has been demonstrated to promote the in vitro refolding and assembly of a variety of chemically denatured proteins, including rhodanese(4.Martin J.

The promiscuity of GroEL in polypeptide recognition and binding suggests that the hydrophobic interactions accounting for the complex formation vary from substrate to substrate(9.Viitanen P.V. Gatenby A.A. Lorimer G.H. Protein Sci. 1992; 1: 363-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 10.Zahn R. Axmann S.E. Rucknagel K-P. Jaeger E. Laminet A.A. Pluckthun A. J. Mol.

The fact that some proteins require only K+ and ATP-Mg (or a non-hydrolyzable analog) for release of functional enzyme from the complex, whereas others also require the co-chaperonin GroES, supports this idea that complexes with some non-native proteins are stronger than others(12.Schmidt M.

J. Mol. Biol. 1979; 129: 375-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). The 2.8-Å x-ray crystal structure reveals that each monomer is organized into an equatorial, intermediate, and apical domain, with interactions between equatorial domains exclusively defining the heptamer-heptamer interface(15.Braig K. Otwinowski Z. Hedge R. Boisvert D.C. Joachimiak A. Horwich A.L. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1994; 371: 578-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (1182) Google Scholar). Monomer-monomer interactions within each ring are mediated by the equatorial domains and by conserved interactions at the intermediate-apical domain interface(15.Braig K. Otwinowski Z. Hedge R.

The apical domains line the opening to the central cavity at either end of the oligomer and contain a region(200-263) that has been implicated by site-directed mutagenesis and photoincorporation of the hydrophobic probe bis-ANS 1The abbreviations used are: bis-ANS4,4′-bis(1-anilino-8-naphthalenesulfonic acid)AMP-PNPadenosine 5′-(β,γ-imino)triphosphate. as the site of polypeptide binding(17.Fenton W.A.

Several studies have shown that two GroES molecules can bind to a single GroEL oligomer in the presence of ATP to form symmetric complexes, while others have demonstrated asymmetric complexes (1:1 GroEL:GroES ratio) to be the functional, physiological unit. The few studies that have evaluated the conformational changes in GroEL due to ATP binding or hydrolysis have demonstrated quaternary structural changes consisting of monomer pivoting and apical domain reorientation upon ATP binding(27.Saibil H.R. Zheng D. Roseman A.M. Hunter A.S. Watson G.M.F. Chen S. auf der Mauer A. O'Hara B.P. Wood S.P. Mann N.H. Barnett L.K. Ellis R.J. Curr.

Unfortunately, the results do not provide much information about the exposure of specific sites believed to mediate protein-protein interactions. Finally, nucleotides have also been shown to affect the affinity of GroEL for substrate, with the ADP-Mg complex displaying tight binding and the ATP-Mg complex displaying weak binding(30.Staniforth R.A. Burston S.G. Atkinson T. Clarke A.R. Biochem. J. 1994; 300: 651-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar).There have been several reports on ions (monovalent, divalent, and polyvalent) affecting structural changes in GroEL(31.Azem A. Diamant S. Goloubinoff P. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 6671-6675Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 32.Diamant S. Azem A. Weiss C. Goloubinoff P.

Chem. 1995; 270: 1535-1542Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Monovalent and polyvalent cations are reported to increase the exposure of hydrophobic surfaces on GroEL without disrupting the oligomeric structure(33.Horowitz P.M. Hua S. Gibbons D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1535-1542Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Divalent, but not monovalent, cations stimulate the ATPase activity of GroEL and induce structural changes that allow preferential cross-linking of the heptameric rings(31.Azem A. Diamant S. Goloubinoff P. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 6671-6675Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). These results suggest that cations of various charges may work at several different levels to produce structural changes in the GroEL oligomer.In this report we show that proteolysis by trypsin can be used as a probe for conformational changes in the tetradecameric structure of GroEL. In a native state with Mg2+ as the only ligand, GroEL is not susceptible to proteolysis by trypsin, whereas unliganded GroEL is rapidly digested, leaving only 10% of intact monomers within 30 min. Upon addition of nucleotides (ADP, ATP, or the ATP analog AMP-PNP) and Mg2+, exposure of one predominant cleavage site in the apical domain occurs. When ADP-Mg is liganded to GroEL, producing a state with high affinity for non-native protein, approximately half of the monomers become proteolyzed without loss of the oligomeric structure. Complexes of GroEL-ADP-Mg with GroES or denatured rhodanese are proteolytically sensitive in a manner similar to the nucleotide-liganded state. In contrast, a GroES-GroEL-rhodanese complex formed in the presence of ADP-Mg is significantly protected from proteolysis (~90% protected). Monovalent and polyvalent cations also affect trypsin proteolysis of GroEL, protecting approximately half of the sites from cleavage compared with an unliganded state. These results suggest that nucleotide binding induces asymmetry in the GroEL tetradecamer, exposing specific sites in the apical domain of only one heptameric ring such that they are accessible to other proteins in solution, either protease or substrate proteins.MATERIALS AND METHODSReagents and ProteinsAll reagents used were of analytical grade. Trypsin was L-1-tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone-treated type XIII purchased from Sigma. Low molecular weight markers were purchased from Bio-Rad. Hide powder azure was purchased from Calbiochem.Rhodanese was prepared as described previously (34.Miller D.M. Kurzban G.P. Mendoza J.A. Chirgwin J.M. Hardies S.C. Horowitz P.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1121: 286-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) and stored at −70°C as a crystalline suspension in 1.8 M ammonium sulfate. Rhodanese concentrations were determined using A0.1%280nm = 1.75 (35.Sorbo B.H. Acta Chem. Scand. 1953; 7: 1129-1136Crossref Google Scholar) and a molecular mass of 33 kDa(36.Ploegman J.H. Drent G.

The chaperonin, GroEL, was purified from lysates of E. coli cells bearing the multicopy plasmid pGroESL(37.Goloubinoff P. Gatenby A.A. Lorimer G.H. Nature. 1989; 337: 44-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar). The purification was by a modified version of published protocols(20.Todd M.J. Viitanen P.V. Lorimer G.H. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 8560-8567Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), excluding the Mono Q and hydroxyapatite columns. After purification, GroEL was dialyzed against 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 0.1 mM dithiothreitol and then made 10% (v/v) in glycerol, rapidly frozen, and stored at −70°C. The co-chaperonin, GroES, was purified from lysates of E. coli cells bearing the multicopy plasmid pND5, using a previously published protocol(38.Staniforth R.A. Cortes A. Burston S.G. Atkinson T. Holbrook J.J. Clarke A.R. FEBS Lett. 1994; 344: 129-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). After purification, GroES was stored at 4°C in 70% ammonium sulfate. Prior to use, GroES was centrifuged in a microcentrifuge, and the pellet was resuspended in 50 mM triethanolamine hydrochloride, pH 8.0, and dialyzed overnight against the same buffer. The protomer concentration of GroEL was measured under denaturing conditions, and GroES was measured under non-denaturing conditions using the bicinchoninic acid assay (Pierce) according to the procedure recommended by the manufacturer.ProteolysisGroEL (10.4 μM monomer) in 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 10 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, and ligands as specified in the text or figure legends was incubated with trypsin (5%, w/w) at room temperature for the times noted in the figure legends. The reactions were stopped one of two ways: 1) by adding phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride to 3 mM from a stock solution in ethanol and allowing the sample to incubate on ice for 10 min prior to adding sample buffer; or 2) by adding heated sample buffer and immediately boiling for 5 min prior to analysis on denaturing polyacrylamide gels. The results obtained were the same regardless of which method was used for stopping the proteolysis reaction. The proteolytic activity of trypsin under various buffer and ionic conditions was tested using an ultrasensitive colorimetric method as described by Rinderknecht et al.(39.Rinderknecht H. Geokas M.C.

Acta. 1968; 21: 197-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar).For the experiments involving GroEL-rhodanese protein complexes, rhodanese was unfolded in 8 M urea as described previously (40.Mendoza J.A. Butler M.C. Horowitz P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24648-24654Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and diluted into a solution containing GroEL and all the other components of the buffered solution as indicated in the figure legends. In forming ternary complexes of GroEL-GroES-rhodanese, GroES was added to a solution already containing GroEL, nucleotide, and unfolded rhodanese. In each case, the final solutions were incubated at room temperature for at least 10 min to allow complex formation prior to proteolysis.Gel ElectrophoresisDenaturing gel electrophoresis (SDS electrophoresis) was performed using 12% polyacrylamide gels by the method of Laemmli(41.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206016) Google Scholar). Nondenaturing gel electrophoresis was performed by the method of Neuhoff et al.(42.Neuhoff V. Cheong-Kim K. Altland K. Electrophoresis. 1986; 7: 56-57Crossref Scopus (27) Google Scholar), using 6% polyacrylamide gels and a constant 200 V for a 1-mm thick gel. Gels were stained with either 0.2% Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250, 40% methanol, and 10% acetic acid or by the method of Kratzin et al.(43.Kratzin H.D. Wiltfang J. Karas M. Neuhoff V. Hilschmann N. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 183: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), using 0.064% Coomassie Brilliant Blue G, 20% methanol, 1.28% phosphoric acid, and 6.4% ammonium sulfate.Amino Acid Sequence Analysis of Proteolytic FragmentsTrypsin digestion products of GroEL were electrophoresed as above and then electrophoretically transferred onto Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA) using a semi-dry transfer system (American Bionetics, Inc., Hayward, CA) as described previously(44.Merrill G.A. Butler M.C. Horowitz P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15611-15620Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The membrane was stained with 0.1% Ponceau S in water until the peptides were just visible. The desired bands were excised, washed, and allowed to air dry. The fragments were then analyzed on an Applied Biosystems 477A protein sequence analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Peptides were subjected to approximately 12 rounds of sequencing. The sequences of the fragments were compared with the published sequence of GroEL to determine their positions within the intact protein(3.Hemmingsen S.M. Woolford C. van der Vies S.M. Tilly K. Dennis D.T. Georgopoulos C.P. Hendrix R.W. Ellis R.J. Nature. 1988; 333: 330-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (919) Google Scholar).Scanning and Quantitation of Protein GelsCoomassie-stained gels were imaged using a CCD 505 video camera (CCTV Corp., New York) under the control of NIH-Image software running on a Macintosh IIci microcomputer. Band densities were quantified using the densitometry options of the software.High Performance Liquid ChromatographySamples were chromatographed on a TSK-G4000-PW (30 × 7.5 mm) column equilibrated with 25 mM NaPO4, 50 mM NaCl, 0.1 mM EDTA, pH 7.6, and monitored at 230 nm.Curve FittingExcept where noted in the figure legends, data were fit using a non-linear least squares fitting procedure implemented in the software program, PSI Plot (Poly Software International, Salt Lake City, UT). Where data were fit to an exponential, the following equation was used: Y = A1e-kt+ A2, where Y represents the measured value, t represents time in minutes, A1 represents the fraction of total protein susceptible to digestion (A1e-kt therefore represents the fraction of protein digested at time t), and A2 represents the fraction of protein resistant to proteolysis.TerminologyThe notations used to designate complexes imply neither stoichiometries nor ligand distribution but merely the substituents of the complex based on the reaction mix and conditions used in the complex formation.RESULTSOligomeric GroEL Can Be Proteolyzed by Trypsin in a Ligand-dependent FashionFig. 1A represents a denaturing gel showing the time course for trypsin digestion of a GroEL-ADP-Mg complex. The parent band, representing a GroEL monomer, is digested, and a doublet appears consisting of bands with apparent molecular masses of ~31 and ~32 kDa. The intensities of the doublet bands increase over the time course and are approximately equal to each other at every time point, suggesting that they appeared together rather than one giving rise to the other upon further degradation. Other extremely faint bands appear but were not quantified since they do not represent a significant percentage of the digested GroEL monomer. The N-terminal sequences of the two bands of the doublet were determined, and they represent complementary sequences in a GroEL monomer; the upper band begins at glycine 269, and the lower band begins at the N terminus of the mature protein (alanine). Trypsin cleavage at Arg-268, in the apical domain, would produce two fragments of these approximate molecular masses and with the observed N-terminal sequences.Fig. 1B is a semi-log plot representing the percentage of parent band (monomeric GroEL) remaining at various times during the trypsin digestion of the GroEL-ADP-Mg complex. The curve was best fit by a single exponential with the following parameters: k = 0.186 s-1, A1 = 0.423, and A2 = 0.516, where A2 represents the fraction of undigested protein remaining at long proteolysis times. The results indicate that within the first 15 min of proteolysis approximately half of the monomers in the tetradecamer were cleaved at Arg-268, while the other half of the monomer population remained intact. Longer periods of digestion (up to 60 min) did not produce significantly more than 50% digestion (data not shown).Fig. 2A shows a similar plot for the proteolysis of GroEL under different conditions. The upper curve (solid circles) represents trypsin proteolysis of the GroEL oligomer in the presence of 20 mM Mg2+. Very little digestion occurred (10% at most) without production of a doublet such as that seen in Fig. 1A. The lower curve (open squares) demonstrates the significant digestion of the unliganded GroEL oligomer. These data (open squares) were best fit by a single exponential with the following parameters: k = 0.067 s-1, A1 = 0.852, and A2 = 0.094. The digestion of unliganded GroEL also produced the doublet shown in Fig. 1A, but the percentage of the parent band converted to doublet was less, and many other weakly staining bands appeared (data not shown). These observations are consistent with the presence of a broader distribution of GroEL structures in the absence of ligand. Finally, in the absence of ligand, higher trypsin concentrations (10-20%) completely digested the chaperonin, producing fragments that were too small (or too weakly staining) to be visualized on the 12% denaturing gels used (data not shown).Figure 2:Trypsin proteolysis of GroEL with or without Mg2+. A, semi-log plot showing the time course of trypsin digestion of GroEL, represented as percent of undigested monomers remaining at increasing times of proteolysis. GroEL (10.4 μM monomer) in 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 10 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, with 20 mM MgCl2 (•) or without MgCl2 (□) was digested with 5% trypsin (w/w) as in Fig. 1A. Data points represent averages of either two (+MgCl2, •) or three (unliganded, □) separate experiments. The data were fit to a straight line (•) or an exponential curve (□) as described under “Materials and Methods.” B, effect of increasing Mg2+ concentration on trypsin digestion of GroEL. Separate samples of GroEL (10.4 μM monomer) in 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 10 mM 2-mercaptoethanol and increasing concentrations of MgCl2, as indicated on the x axis, were digested with 5% trypsin (w/w) for 30 min and then treated as in Fig. 1A. Data points (•) represent averages of two separate denaturing gels. Since this phenomenon is more complex than a simple tight binding ligand(31.Azem A. Diamant S. Goloubinoff P. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 6671-6675Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), the dashed line is not a fitted line but is simply drawn to guide the eye.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To investigate the differences in proteolysis between unliganded and magnesium-liganded GroEL an experiment was conducted where the degree of proteolysis was measured at fixed times (15 or 30 min) at increasing concentrations of Mg2+. The results, graphed in Fig. 2B, show that an increasing percentage of the monomers were protected from trypsin proteolysis as the Mg2+ concentration was increased from 0 to 20 mM, with maximum protection afforded by 10-12 mM. This protection from trypsin proteolysis at increasing Mg2+ concentrations is strikingly similar to the effect of increasing Mg2+ concentrations on the cross-linking of heptameric rings in GroEL (31.Azem A. Diamant S. Goloubinoff P. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 6671-6675Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar).Trypsin proteolysis of GroEL in the presence of ATP-Mg or AMP-PNP-Mg produced results similar to those seen with ADP-Mg. Fig. 3 is a semi-log plot comparing the results with the three nucleotides, showing that all three produced an oligomeric structure that was sensitive to trypsin proteolysis. It is clear that nucleotide binding alone and not hydrolysis produced the conformational change necessary to expose the clip site in the apical domain. In each of the three cases the same digestion products appeared on denaturing gels, with the bands of the doublet described above representing the predominant species (data not shown).Figure 3:Trypsin proteolysis of GroEL in complex with ATP, ADP, or AMP-PNP. The semi-log plot shows the time course of trypsin digestion of GroEL (percent undigested monomers remaining versus time of proteolysis) complexed with various nucleotides. GroEL (10.4 μM monomer) in 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 10 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 20 mM MgCl2, and 10 mM ADP (•), AMP-PNP (□), or ATP (♦) was digested with 5% trypsin (w/w) as in Fig. 1A. Data points for ADP are the same as Fig. 1B and are simply replotted here for ease of comparison. Data for each nucleotide were fit to an exponential curve as described under “Materials and Methods.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Proteolyzed GroEL Retains Its Tetradecameric StructureFig. 4 shows a non-denaturing gel of samples digested with trypsin for various times in the presence of ADP-Mg (treated as in Fig. 1). In this gel system the band shown corresponds to tetradecameric GroEL, which runs as a sharp band near the top of the gel and can be easily distinguished from monomers (not present/seen) that run as a smeared band and migrate considerably further into the gel(45.Ybarra J. Horowitz P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22962-22967Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The single band representing the GroEL tetradecamer is initially sharp but becomes increasingly fuzzy as the proteolysis progresses, and the band appears slightly but progressively higher in the gel. The staining intensity of the single band also increases by approximately 50% across the series. These results demonstrate that the proteolysis did not disrupt the oligomeric structure of the GroEL but certainly did produce a band with altered electrophoretic and staining properties, suggesting a heterogeneous population of structures.Figure 4:Effect of trypsin proteolysis on the tetradecameric structure of GroEL. Non-denaturing gel showing the time course of trypsin digestion of a GroEL-ADP-Mg complex. Trypsin proteolysis of GroEL (10.4 μM monomer) in 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 10 mM ADP, 20 mM MgCl2, and 10 mM 2-mercaptoethanol was performed as in Fig. 1A, and the samples were electrophoresed on a non-denaturing gel as described under “Materials and Methods.” Lanes 1-7 correspond to: GroEL standard (untreated) and 1, 3, 5, 10, 20, and 30 min of digestion.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)There was a question of whether the non-denaturing gels were visualizing tetradecamers that had not fallen apart or tetradecamers that had reassembled during electrophoresis. This question was addressed by running samples treated in the same manner as above on a gel permeation column (TSK-4000), a system that resolves monomers from tetradecamers. The samples of ADP-Mg-liganded GroEL treated with trypsin for 30 min eluted in the same volumes as controls with native, unperturbed GroEL, or ADP-Mg-liganded oligomers that had not been proteolyzed, indicating that the tetradecamers remained intact after proteolysis (data not shown). Two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was also performed. The bands from non-denaturing gels were excised, dissolved in SDS sample buffer, and electrophoresed on denaturing gels. The results were exactly the same as when samples were run directly on denaturing gels, as shown in Fig. 1A. These results confirmed that the bands visualized on the non-denaturing gels consisted of cut and uncut monomers, which remained associated as oligomers after proteolysis.Formation of a Ternary Complex Protects GroEL from Trypsin ProteolysisTrypsin proteolysis of GroEL was used to probe various complexes of GroEL with GroES and/or unfolded rhodanese. Fig. 5 is a semi-log plot showing the trypsin digestion of GroEL in complex with GroES and/or non-native rhodanese. The two binary complexes, GroEL-GroES (1:1 molar ratio) (filled circles) and GroEL-rhodanese (1:2.5) (open diamonds), formed in the presence of ADP-Mg showed approximately the same digestion of GroEL as with nucleotide alone. Since both rhodanese and GroES were digested by trypsin in these experiments, it is difficult to draw simple conclusions from the results, although similar results for a GroEL-GroES complex have been previously reported(46.Baneyx F. Gatenby A.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11637-11644Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, the ternary complex of GroES-GroEL-rhodanese (2:1:2), formed in the presence of ADP-Mg, significantly protected the chaperonin from trypsin proteolysis (asterisks). These results are very similar to the protection from proteolysis"

https://openalex.org/W2108061170,"We have addressed the question of whether protein kinase substrate efficacy is a reliable barometer for successful inhibitor design by assessing the dependence of kcat and kcat/Km for eight separate alcohol-bearing residues on solvent viscosity. We have found that the Km for three structurally distinct primary alcohol-containing peptides overestimates the affinity that these species exhibit for the cAMP-dependent protein kinase. In all three cases, the rate-determining step is product release, and substrate binding is best described as rapid equilibrium. In contrast, peptides containing the following phosphorylatable residues all provide Km values that are accurate assessments of substrate affinity for the protein kinase: a secondary alcohol, a simple phenol, and a primary alcohol with a relatively long side chain. In the latter three instances, the rate-determining step is phosphoryl transfer. Finally, two aromatic alcohol-containing residues that possess lipophilic side chains exhibit Michaelis constants that underestimate enzyme affinity. These results demonstrate that while it may be tempting to employ structural elements from the most efficient substrates (e.g. primary alcohols) for inhibitor design, less effective substrates may serve as a more accurate assessment of inhibitory success.

Protein kinases are often classified by their ability to specifically phosphorylate tyrosine or serine/threonine residues in intact proteins(1.Hanks S.K. Quinn A.M. Hunter T. Science. 1988; 241: 42-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (3809) Google Scholar).

In addition, the “tyrosine-specific” protein kinases v-Abl and c-Src exhibit an analogous broad active-site substrate specificity(10.Lee T.R. Niu J. Lawrence D.S. J. Biol.

Interestingly, although the active sites of these enzymes are unexpectedly tolerant, they are not entirely indiscriminate. In the kinases examined to date, we have found that each enzyme exhibits its own unique ability to recognize and accommodate specific structural motifs associated with the alcohol-bearing residue(8.Lee T.R. Niu J. Lawrence D.S. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 4245-4250Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 9.Wood J. Yan X. Mendelow M. Corbin J.D. Francis S.H. Lawrence D.S. J. Biol.

Consequently, even such closely related enzymes as PKA and its cGMP-dependent counterpart can be distinguished by their own unique active-site substrate specificities(9.Wood J. Yan X. Mendelow M.

Indeed, on the basis of these results, we recently designed an affinity label that specifically inactivates cGMP-dependent protein kinase, yet is completely ineffective against PKA. 2X. Yan, J. D.

In short, these unanticipated differences in substrate specificity should significantly enhance the ability to design agents targeted for specific members of the protein kinase family. In addition, substrate specificity studies provide a detailed assessment of the range of functionality that can be accommodated within the active sites of protein kinases.

PKA is the best understood of all protein kinases, both in terms of structure and catalytic behavior. This enzyme catalyzes the phosphorylation of a wide variety of protein and peptide substrates, including the heptapeptide Leu-Arg-Arg-Ala-Ser-Leu-Gly (Kemptide)(12.Kemp B.E. Graves D.J. Benjamini E. Krebs E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 4888-4894Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The latter is an extremely impressive substrate (Km= 16 μM and Vmax = 20 μmol/min/mg). Although replacement of the serine moiety with a nonphosphorylatable alanine provides a competitive inhibitor (i.e. Leu-Arg-Arg-Ala-Ala-Leu-Gly with respect to Kemptide), the inhibitory efficacy of this species is decidedly unimpressive (Ki = 320 μM) (13.Whitehouse S.

The poor inhibitory performance of the Ala-based peptide may be a consequence of the missing hydroxyl moiety, which could play a critical role in promoting peptide affinity. However, equilibrium dialysis measurements of radiolabeled Kemptide (in the absence of ATP or in the presence of AMP-PNP to preclude peptide phosphorylation) revealed a lackluster affinity for PKA (Kd = 210 μM)(13.Whitehouse S. Feramisco J.R. Casnellie J.E. Krebs E.G. Walsh D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 3693-3701Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A recent series of experiments by Adams and Taylor (17.Adams J.A. Taylor S.S. Biochemistry. 1992; 31 (and references cited therein): 8516-8522Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar) has uncovered the explanation for the discrepancy between the Km of Kemptide and the Kd and Ki values obtained for it and analogous peptides, respectively. These investigators employed viscosogenic agents to assess the diffusion limits of the PKA-catalyzed phosphorylation of several peptides. They established a minimum Kemptide Kd for the PKA•ATP binary complex, a value that is significantly larger than the corresponding Km. This difference between Kdand Km values is due, in part, to an extremely rapid phosphoryl transfer step. Unfortunately, this divergence in Kd and Km is somewhat disconcerting given the desire to relate the results of substrate specificity studies to inhibitor design. What structural parameters provide Km values for substrates that are accurate indicators of enzyme affinity? We have addressed this question by analyzing the effect of solvent viscosity on the rate of the PKA-catalyzed phosphorylation of eight structurally distinct alcohol-containing peptide substrates. We have found that with aromatic and secondary alcohols, the Km is a realistic indicator of PKA affinity. Indeed, in the case of two aromatic substrates, the Km appears to be an underestimate of how well the substrate binds to the enzyme active site. In contrast, primary alcohol-containing substrates (with one exception) provide Km values that substantially overestimate PKA affinity.

The crude peptides were dissolved in a minimum of doubly distilled water and ion-exchanged on SP-Sephadex C-25 (0.4-1.2 M KCl gradient in 50 mM sodium acetate, pH 3.5; total volume of 400 ml). The partially purified peptides were subsequently subjected to preparative HPLC using three Waters radial compression modules (25 × 10 cm) connected in series: a gradient from 0 to 3 min (100% A), a linear gradient from 3 min (100% A) to 35 min (65% A and 35% B), and a linear gradient from 35 min (65% A to 35% B) to 40 min (30% A and 70% B). All peptides were subsequently reanalyzed by analytical HPLC using a Waters μBondapak C18 column (3.9 × 300 mm). Those peptides that contained extraneous peaks were repurified on the analytical column. All of the purified peptides gave satisfactory fast atom bombardment mass spectral analysis. All assays were performed in triplicate at pH 7.1 and thermostated in a water bath maintained at 30°C. Final assay volume totaled 50 μl and contained 100 mM MOPS, 150 mM KCl, 12.5 mM MgCl2, 0.125 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and between 0.35 and 175 nM catalytic subunit, depending on the efficiency of the substrate. For the determination of the kinetic constants, the following concentrations were employed: 100 μM [γ-32P]ATP (100-500 cpm/pmol) and a substrate concentration over a 10-fold range around the apparent Km. The phosphorylation reactions were initiated by addition of 10 μl of catalytic subunit diluted from a concentrated stock solution (1.5 mg/ml in 100 mM MOPS, 150 mM KCl, 1 mM dithiothreitol, and 0.125 mg/ml bovine serum albumin at pH 7.1). Reactions were terminated after 5.0 min by spotting 25-μl aliquots onto 2.1-cm diameter phosphocelluose paper discs. After 10 s, the discs were immersed in 10% glacial acetic acid and allowed to soak with occasional stirring for at least 1 h. The acetic acid was decanted, and the discs were washed with 4 volumes of 0.5% H3PO4 and 1 volume of distilled water. A final acetone rinse was employed, and the discs were air-dried and placed in plastic scintillation vials containing 6 ml of Liquiscint prior to scintillation counting for radioactivity. The apparent Km (±S.D.) and Vmax (±S.D.) values were determined from initial rate experiments. The data from these experiments were plotted using the Lineweaver-Burk procedure, and the corresponding plots proved to be linear. We have recently begun to explore the active-site substrate specificity of protein kinases(3.Kwon Y.-G. Mendelow M. Srinivasan J. Lee T.R. Pluskey S. Salerno A. Lawrence D.S. J. Biol.

The results of these experiments provide a structural foundation upon which inhibitor design can be based. Namely, the range of functionality that can be readily accommodated within the active sites of these enzymes provides an assessment of what structural limitations, if any, exist with respect to inhibitor design. Unfortunately, substrate specificity studies do not necessarily provide a gauge of how specific structural motifs associated with the substrate influence affinity for the enzyme. We have now explored this issue with eight distinct structural archetypes, positioned on peptides at the site of phosphorylation. There are a number of ways to examine the relationship between the Michaelis constant of a particular substrate and the enzyme affinity of that substrate. Obviously, the latter can be directly assessed via such methods as equilibrium dialysis. However, methods of this sort have the disadvantage that ATP cannot be employed under the conditions of the experiment since the peptide substrate would suffer phosphorylation. In the absence of ATP (or in the presence of nonhydrolyzable ATP analogs), the Kd values acquired may not provide an accurate estimate of the affinity of the peptide for the protein kinase. Alternatively, nonphosphorylatable substrate analogs can be examined with respect to their inhibitory potency. However, these species lack the phosphoryl-accepting hydroxyl moiety, a functional group that may very well play a key role in augmenting the affinity of the substrate for the target enzyme. Recently, Adams and Taylor (17.Adams J.A. Taylor S.S. Biochemistry. 1992; 31 (and references cited therein): 8516-8522Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar) employed viscosogenic agents to evaluate the individual microscopic rate constants associated with the PKA-catalyzed phosphorylation of peptide substrates. Although this method does not directly measure the Kd for peptide substrates, it does provide an assessment of the relationship between Km and enzyme affinity in the presence of ATP. The kinetic mechanism of PKA-catalyzed phosphorylation of peptide substrates is (predominantly) an ordered sequential pattern, with ATP binding first(17.Adams J.A. Taylor S.S. Biochemistry. 1992; 31 (and references cited therein): 8516-8522Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Product release is ordered as well, with phosphopeptide discharged first, followed by ADP. The kinetic pattern illustrated in Fig. S1 describes the protein kinase-catalyzed reaction under conditions of saturating ATP. The rate of diffusion of peptide substrate into and out of the active site is given by the microscopic rate constants k2 and k-2, respectively. We have followed the example of Adams and Taylor (17.Adams J.A. Taylor S.S. Biochemistry. 1992; 31 (and references cited therein): 8516-8522Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar) by describing the rate of product release with a single constant, namely k4. Of the two products, the release of ADP is rate-determining. These three rate constants are dependent upon solvent viscosity since this parameter controls the rate at which agents enter or leave the enzyme active site. In contrast, the rate constant (k3) for the phosphoryl transfer step should be independent of solution viscosity. The slope ((kcat)η) of the line generated from kcat°/kcat 3The kcat° and (kcat/Km)° terms are fixed, for each substrate, at 6% glycerol. The kcat and kcat/Km terms vary as a function of solvent viscosity. as a function of relative viscosity is given by. (kcat)η=k3(k3+k4∘)(Eq. 1) If product release is rate-limiting (i.e. k4 ≪ k3), then kcat will be strongly dependent upon solvent viscosity (i.e. (kcat)η will be 1). In contrast, if the phosphoryl transfer step is rate-limiting, then kcat will be independent of solvent viscosity (i.e. (kcat)η will be zero). In an analogous fashion, the slope ((kcat/Km)η) of the line generated from (kcat/Km)°/(kcat/Km) as a function of solvent viscosity is given by. (kcatKm)η=k3(k2∘+k3)(Eq. 2) If the dissociation of the peptide substrate is slow compared with phosphoryl transfer, then kcat/Km will be strongly dependent upon relative viscosity. Under these circumstances, the peptide substrate undergoes phosphorylation much faster than it dissociates from the Michaelis complex. Substrates of this sort are said to be catalytically committed or “sticky”. In contrast, if the phosphoryl transfer step is slow relative to substrate dissociation, then kcat/Km will be independent of solvent viscosity. Table 1 summarizes the relative magnitude of the microscopic rate constants in terms of the dependence of the steady-state kinetic parameters on solution viscosity. Finally, the Km for the peptide substrate is given by. Km=k4(k−2+k3)k2(k3+k4)(Eq. 3) Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab Consequently, the relative magnitudes of Km and Kd can be derived for the four extreme conditions listed in Table 1. We note that a number of assumptions (and controls) are required for a study of this nature. These have been previously described and will not be explicitly dealt with here(17.Adams J.A. Taylor S.S. Biochemistry. 1992; 31 (and references cited therein): 8516-8522Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). The eight peptide substrates employed in this study are listed in Table 2 Table 3, Table 4. The efficacy (kcat/Km) of these compounds as substrates for PKA varies over nearly 4 orders of magnitude (cf.3 and 6). Most of these species are enzymologically as well as structurally distinct. Consequently, they provide a relatively broad portrayal of the fashion by which various substrates can interact with the active site of a protein kinase.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab The (kcat)η value of 0.99 ± 0.03 for the serine amide substrate 1 indicates that the rate of release of ADP is slow relative to the phosphoryl transfer step. Furthermore, the viscosity independence of kcat/Km is evidence that the phosphoryl transfer step is slow relative to the rate of peptide substrate dissociation (k-2). The latter is characteristic of rapid equilibrium binding. In addition, these results demonstrate that the Km for the serine amide peptide 1 overestimates how well the substrate binds to PKA. The fact that Km is not an accurate measure of enzyme affinity for 1 is reminiscent of much of the earlier work with Kemptide and related analogs(13.Whitehouse S. Feramisco J.R. Casnellie J.E. Krebs E.G. Walsh D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 3693-3701Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14.Feramisco J.R. Krebs E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 8968-8971Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Indeed, Adams and Taylor (17.Adams J.A. Taylor S.S. Biochemistry. 1992; 31 (and references cited therein): 8516-8522Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar) extracted similar (kcat)η and (kcat/Km)η values for Leu-Arg-Arg-Ala-Ser-Leu-Gly in their viscosity studies. The primary alcohol-containing peptides 2 and 3, like their serine amide counterpart 1, exhibit a strong kcat dependence upon solvent viscosity. 4We note that a few of the values for (kcat)η and (kcat/Km)η are slightly greater than the theoretical maximum (1.0) or less than the theoretical minimum (0.0). The behavior is most likely a consequence of relatively subtle iterative errors generated during the experimental protocol. Consequently, the release of ADP remains rate-limiting. However, a somewhat different pattern has emerged for 2 and 3 with respect to the influence of viscosity on their kcat/Km values. The leucinol derivative 2 exhibits a modest dependence upon viscosity ((kcat/Km)η = 0.23), whereas the corresponding cysteinol peptide 3 displays an even greater reliance upon this solution parameter ((kcat/Km)η = 0.65). This represents a transition from a rapid equilibrium (for 1) to a more catalytically committed status (for 2 and 3). In addition, it depicts a shift from a Km that is decidedly smaller than the Kd to a situation in which the relationship between Km and Kd becomes more uncertain (i.e. as (kcat/Km)η approaches unity; see Table 1). In the case of peptide 2, Km is given by 1.3(k4/k3)Kd, whereas for 3, the relationship is Km = 2.9(k4/k3)Kd. Since the slope of kcat°/kcatversus solvent viscosity is unity, it is clear that k4 is significantly smaller than k3. Consequently, it is likely that for both peptides 2 and 3, Km remains an overestimate of substrate affinity for PKA. In dramatic contrast to the primary alcohol substrates in Table 2, peptides 4-6 (Table 3) all exhibit (kcat)η values at or near zero. This is indicative of a phosphoryl transfer step that is slower than product release. This, coupled with the fact that the slope of (kcat/Km)°/(kcat/Km) versus solvent viscosity is zero, indicates that the Km values obtained for substrates 4-6 are accurate estimates of the affinity that these species exhibit for the protein kinase (Table 1). These substrates are a rather diverse collection of functionality, containing secondary, primary, and aromatic alcohols. However, they do share two nonstructural features, namely, relatively high Km and relatively low kcat values.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab The kcat and kcat/Km for substrates 4-6 are independent of solvent viscosity, an observation that implies that the rate-determining step is phosphoryl transfer for all three substrates. This is particularly noteworthy for the secondary alcohol-containing substrate 4, which exhibits a structural resemblance to threonine. Previously, we (19.Prorok M. Lawrence D.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 158: 136-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar) as well as others (12.Kemp B.E. Graves D.J. Benjamini E. Krebs E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 4888-4894Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20.Chessa G. Borin G. Marchiori F. Meggio F. Brunati A.M. Pinna L.A. Eur. J.

Pierce, Rockford, IL1979: 169-172Google Scholar) have shown that threonine-containing peptides are notably poorer substrates than their serine-containing counterparts. The Km values for the former are significantly elevated relative to the latter. However, it appears likely that these elevated Km values for secondary alcohol-containing substrates are a more realistic assessment of enzyme affinity than the Michaelis constants for primary alcohols (such as those listed in Table 2). From the relationships between Km and Kd provided in Table 1, this is due to a shift in the rate-determining step from product release (primary alcohol substrates) to phosphoryl transfer (secondary alcohol substrates). Not all primary alcohols, however, behave as those listed in Table 2. Phosphoryl transfer is rate-limiting in the case of 5 (i.e. kcat is nearly completely independent of solvent viscosity). This compound contains a hydroxyl moiety three carbons removed from the peptide backbone. In contrast, this distance is a mere two carbon atoms in serine and related species (Table 2). Consequently, it is possible that the alcohol functionality of 5 is inserted into the active site in a fashion that is less than ideal for phosphoryl transfer. Alternatively, the adjacent peptide bond, which likely plays an important role in positioning the alcohol side chain in the active site, may be improperly aligned. In either case, inappropriate active-site/substrate alignment could result in a reduced rate of phosphoryl transfer, thereby rendering this step rate-determining. In either instance, both (kcat/Km)η and (kcat)η would be independent of solvent viscosity. The steady-state kinetic parameters of the aromatic alcohol-containing peptide 6, like those associated with 4 and 5, are viscosity-independent. In contrast, the substrate efficacy of the corresponding aromatic alcohols 7 and 8 is clearly affected by the presence of viscosogenic agents. The phosphoryl transfer step is fast relative to substrate dissociation. In addition, the kcat for both substrates is viscosity-independent, behavior emblematic of a phosphoryl transfer step that is slow relative to product release. These combined results indicate that the observed Km for 7 and 8 is an underestimate of the affinity of these peptides for PKA (Table 1). As a consequence of the latter, PKA affinity must be significantly larger for 7 and 8 than for 6. Finally, it is evident from Table 3 and Table 4 that peptides 7 and 8 are considerably more efficient substrates than 6. The relationship between the microscopic rate constants k-2 and k3 for compounds 7 and 8 (k-2 ≪ k3) differs from that of 6 (k-2 ≫ k3). There are two structural features that are potentially responsible for this change in kinetic behavior. PKA contains a lipophilic pocket adjacent to the enzyme active site(22.Knighton D.R. Zheng J. Ten Eyck L.F. Xuong N.-H. Taylor S.S. Sowadski J.M. Science. 1991; 253: 414-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (811) Google Scholar). Compounds 7 and 8 possess a hydrophobic tail positioned para to the phosphorylatable alcohol, a structural feature missing in 6. In short, the relatively slow substrate off-rate associated with the phosphorylation of 7 and 8 may be due to enhanced binding augmented by the attached hydrophobic substituents. Indeed, the S-benzylcysteinol derivative 3 also contains a hydrophobic tail, and this species also exhibits a kcat/Km that is strongly viscosity-dependent, which likewise implies a slow substrate off-rate compared with the rate of phosphoryl transfer. Furthermore, peptides 1, 4, and 5, which lack a hydrophobic substituent, all exhibit (kcat/Km)η values of zero. These results also imply that a hydrophobic residue at the P + 1 position (or its equivalent) is important for promoting the affinity of peptides for PKA. However, this change in the relationship between the microscopic rate constants k-2 and k3 can be explained by a structural feature other than the lipophilic side chain. Graves and co-workers (23.Martin B.L. Wu D. Jakes S. Graves D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7108-7111Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) proposed several years ago that the relatively low rate of turnover for tyrosine kinase-catalyzed phosphorylations (versus those catalyzed by serine/threonine-specific protein kinases) can be attributed to the low nucleophilicity of the tyrosine hydroxyl compared with the aliphatic alcohols of serine and threonine. In other words, the aromatic alkoxide of 6 is inherently less reactive than the aliphatic alkoxides of 1-3. This could very well explain why the phosphoryl transfer step is so slow for 6. In contrast, both 7 and 8 contain the electron-donating amide moiety, a structural element that should enhance the nucleophilicity of the aromatic alkoxide and thereby accelerate the rate of phosphoryl transfer. Unfortunately, at this point, it is unclear whether the hydrophobic side chains of 7 and 8 are responsible for a relatively slow substrate off-rate or the electron-donating power of the amide moiety should be held accountable for a comparatively rapid phosphoryl transfer step. These two separate factors may very well be operating in conjunction. Others have previously shown that the Michaelis constant and enzyme affinity are not necessarily identical for protein kinase substrates. Adams and Taylor (17.Adams J.A. Taylor S.S. Biochemistry. 1992; 31 (and references cited therein): 8516-8522Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar) have explicitly demonstrated this with Kemptide. Walsh and co-workers (24.Glass D.B. Cheng H.-C. Mende-Mueller L. Reed J. Walsh D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8802-8810Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25.Mitchell R.D. Glass D.B. Wong C.-W. Angelos K.L. Walsh D.A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 528-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) have shown that the Ki for Gly-Arg-Thr-Gly-Arg-Arg-Asn-Ala-Ile-amide is 4-fold smaller than the Km for the corresponding serine-containing substrate, Gly-Arg-Thr-Gly-Arg-Arg-Asn-Ser-Ile-amide. We have now shown that the relationship between Km and enzyme affinity is profoundly dependent upon the structural nature of the alcohol-bearing residue. The primary alcohol-containing peptides 1-3 exhibit Km values that are smaller than the estimated Kd values. This observation may be of some significance, particularly with respect to inhibitor design. For example, an inhibitor that is structurally related to peptides 1-3 may very well exhibit a Ki value that is disappointingly higher than the observed Michaelis constants for these substrates. In contrast, the secondary alcohol 4, the primary alcohol 5, and the aromatic alcohol 6 furnish Km values that are accurate estimates of the affinity that these peptides exhibit for PKA. Finally, the Michaelis constants associated with the aromatic alcohols 7 and 8 appear to underestimate how well these substrates bind to the enzyme active site. In short, although it is tempting to utilize the most efficient substrates as the structural basis for inhibitor design, less effective substrates may act as more accurate barometers of inhibitory success. We thank Professor Joseph Adams (Department of Chemistry, San Diego State University) for helpful advice."
