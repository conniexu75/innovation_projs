https://openalex.org/W1982071077,"Mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) cause cystic fibrosis. In order to evaluate its function, CFTR was expressed in HeLa, Chinese hamster ovary (CHO), and NIH 3T3 fibroblast cells, and anion permeability was assessed with a fluorescence microscopic assay and the whole-cell patch-clamp technique. Adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cAMP) increased anion permeability and chloride currents in cells expressing CFTR, but not in cells expressing a mutant CFTR (delta F508) or in nontransfected cells. The simplest interpretation of these observations is that CFTR is itself a cAMP-activated chloride channel. The alternative interpretation, that CFTR directly or indirectly regulates chloride channels, requires that these cells have endogenous cryptic, chloride channels that are stimulated by cAMP only in the presence of CFTR."

https://openalex.org/W2100432609,"The nature of involvement of the cystic fibrosis gene product (CFTR) in epithelial anion transport is not yet understood. We have expressed CFTR in Sf9 insect cells using the baculovirus expression vector system. Reactivity with antibodies against 12 different epitopes spanning the entire sequence suggested that the complete polypeptide chain was synthesized. Immunogold labeling showed localization to both cell-surface and intracellular membranes. Concomitant with CFTR expression, these cells exhibited a new cAMP-stimulated anion permeability. This conductance, monitored both by radioiodide efflux and patch clamping, strongly resembled that present in several CFTR-expressing human epithelial cells. These findings demonstrate that CFTR can function in heterologous nonepithelial cells and lend support to the possibility that CFTR may itself be a regulated anion channel."
https://openalex.org/W1555409791,"Epidermal growth factor stimulates the activity of several cytosolic serine/threonine protein kinases in quiescent Swiss 3T3 cells. Two of these, which use myelin basic protein (MBP) as substrate, act as kinase kinases in that they are able to activate a separate peptide kinase activity in vitro by a mechanism involving protein phosphorylation. In this study, we have identified two activities from extracts of epidermal growth factor-treated cells that stimulate an ATP-dependent activation of both of the MBP kinases, derived in their inactive precursor forms from extracts of untreated cells. The resulting MBP kinase activities are stable to further purification and can be inactivated with either tyrosine or serine/threonine protein phosphatases and then reactivated to their original levels of activity. Thus, we propose that the in vitro activation involves protein phosphorylation, stimulated by the action of novel MBP kinase activating factors that represent intermediate components in a growth factor-stimulated kinase cascade."
https://openalex.org/W1957404430,"The cofactor requirements of macrophage nitric oxide (NO·) synthase suggest involvement of an NADPH-dependent flavoprotein. This prompted us to test the effect of the flavoprotein inhibitors diphenyleneiodonium (DPI), di-2-thienyliodonium (DTI), and iodoniumdiphenyl (ID) on the NO· synthases of macrophages and endothelium. DPI, DTI, and ID completely inhibited NO· synthesis by mouse macrophages, their lysates, and partially purified macrophage NO· synthase. Inhibition of NO· synthase by these agents was potent (IC50‘s 50–150 nM), irreversible, dependent on time and temperature, and independent of enzyme catalysis. The inhibition by DPI was blocked by NADPH, NADP+, or 2'5‘-ADP, but not by NADH. Likewise, FAD or FMN, but not riboflavin or adenosine 5-diphosphoribose, protected NO· synthase from inhibition by DPI. Neither NADPH nor FAD reacted with DPI. Once NO· synthase was inhibited by DPI, neither NADPH nor FAD could restore its activity. DPI also inhibited acetylcholine-induced relaxation of norepinephrine-preconstricted rabbit aortic rings (IC50 300 nM). Inhibition of acetylcholine-induced relaxation persisted for at least 2 h after DPI was washed out. In contrast, DPI had no effect on norepinephrine-induced vasoconstriction itself nor on vasorelaxation induced by the NO·-generating agent sodium nitroprusside. These results suggest that NO∗ synthesis in both macrophages and endothelial cells depends on an NADPH-utilizing flavoprotein. As a new class of NO· synthase inhibitors, DPI and its analogs are likely to prove useful in analyzing the physiologic and pathophysiologic roles of NO·.—Stuehr, D. J.; Fasehun, O. A.; Kwon, N.

https://openalex.org/W2018938193,"Extracellular matrix (ECM) glycoproteins regulate neuronal development and axonal growth. In this paper, the ECM glycoprotein vitronectin was identified and localized in the embryonic chick neuroretina. To identify potentially important neurite outgrowth-promoting molecules, responses of embryonic chick retinal neurons to vitronectin and thrombospondin, another retinal ECM constituent, were examined. These neurons were shown to attach and extend neurites on either glycoprotein. Integrins containing the αv or β1 subunits mediate both responses to vitronectin and neurite outgrowth on thrombospondin. Attachment to thrombospondin was inhibited by heparin, suggesting that neurons also utilize a proteoglycan or sulfated glycolipid as a receptor for this glycoprotein. Thus, retinal neurons use specific receptors to interact with vitronectin and thrombospondin, two glycoproteins present in the embryonic neuroretina, suggesting roles for these ligands and their receptors in retinal development."
https://openalex.org/W1981325854,"Neurotransmitter receptors are generally clustered in the postsynaptic membrane. The mechanism of clustering was analyzed with fibroblast cell lines that were stably transfected with the four subunits for fetal (alpha, beta, gamma, delta) or adult (alpha, beta, epsilon, delta) type mouse muscle nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (AChRs). Immunofluorescent staining indicated that AChRs were dispersed on the surface of these cells. When transiently transfected with an expression construct encoding a 43-kilodalton protein that is normally concentrated under the postsynaptic membrane, AChRs expressed in these cells became aggregated in large cell-surface clusters, colocalized with the 43-kilodalton protein. This suggests that 43-kilodalton protein can induce AChR clustering and that cluster induction involves direct contact between AChR and 43-kilodalton protein."
https://openalex.org/W1571588501,"Antiserum raised against horseradish peroxidase (HRP) recognizes a neural specific carbohydrate antigen in Drosophila and other insects. The epitopic activity of the carbohydrate moiety of HRP recognized by anti-HRP antiserum was measured by a newly developed enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, in which HRP glycopeptides conjugated with bovine serum albumin were coated onto the wells and then reacted with goat anti-HRP antiserum. HRP sugar moieties released by almond glycopeptidase A digestion of HRP pepsin digests were subjected to pyridylamination. Pyridylamino oligosaccharides were separated into seven fractions by reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography. The major fraction, which comprised about 80% of the total sugars, reacted strongly with anti-HRP antiserum. The carbohydrate structure of this fraction was determined by sugar composition analysis and 600-MHz 1H NMR spectroscopy as follows: Man alpha 1→6(Man alpha 1→3)(Xyl beta 1→2)Man beta 1→4GlcNAc beta 1→4(Fuc alpha 1→3)GlcNAc. Analyses of reactivity with anti-HRP antiserum of various oligosaccharide derivatives obtained from the major fraction by exoglycosidase digestion and partial acid hydrolysis indicated that alpha 1→6-linked mannose and alpha 1→3-linked fucose are predominantly involved in the epitopic structure."

https://openalex.org/W1486448888,"Abstract Recently, the purification of nitric oxide synthase (EC 1.14.23) from rat cerebellum has been reported, and the enzyme is a calmodulin-requiring enzyme (Bredt, D. S., and Snyder, S. H. (1990) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 87, 682-685). In this paper, nitric oxide synthase has been purified to near homogeneity from the cytosol fraction of rat polymorphonuclear neutrophils. The purification procedure involves affinity chromatography with adenosine 2',5'-diphosphate-agarose and an anion exchange column, DEAE-Bio-Gel A. On polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in sodium dodecyl sulfate, the enzyme migrated as a single protein band with Mr = 150,000. The molecular weight was estimated to be 150,000 by gel filtration on a Superose 12 HR 10/30. The purified enzyme was unstable with a half-life of 3 h at pH 7.4 and 4 degrees C. The enzyme activity required the presence of Ca2+, NADPH, FAD, and (6R)-5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-L-biopterin. Calmodulin antagonists (W5, W7, W13, and trifluoperazine dihydrochloride) did not inhibit the enzyme activity, and the addition of calmodulin was also ineffective for the increase in the enzyme activity. The neutrophil enzyme appears to be a calmodulin-independent type of nitric oxide synthase."
https://openalex.org/W1585657790,"Previous studies demonstrated that the in vitro tyrosine phosphorylation of the human erythrocyte anion transporter, band 3, prevented the binding of various glycolytic enzymes to the N terminus of the cytoplasmic tail. Since these enzymes are inhibited in their bound state, the functional consequences of band 3 tyrosine phosphorylation in the red cell should be to activate the enzymes and elevate glycolysis. We searched for various enhancers of band 3 tyrosine phosphorylation using a novel assay designed to measure the phosphotyrosine levels at the band 3 tyrosine phosphorylation/glycolytic enzyme-binding site. This assay measures the extent of phosphorylation of a synthetic band 3 peptide entrapped within resealed red cells. Using this assay, three distinct compounds, all mild oxidants, were found to stimulate the tyrosine phosphorylation of band 3. All three compounds were also found to elevate glycolytic rates in intact erythrocytes. Moreover, the antitumor drug adriamycin was found to coordinately prevent these agents from stimulating both band 3 tyrosine phosphorylation and erythrocyte glycolysis. These results suggest a possible function for a protein tyrosine kinase in human erythrocytes, to regulate glycolysis through the tyrosine phosphorylation of band 3."
https://openalex.org/W1548286725,"The interaction between type 1 plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI-1) and fragments of vitronectin (Vn) was investigated. The PAI-1-binding domain was not destroyed when Vn was cleaved by treatment with either acid or CNBr. Acid-cleaved Vn was fractionated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and analyzed by PAI-1 ligand binding. The smallest fragment (Mr 40,000) that retained PAI-1 binding function was sequenced and shown to contain the NH2 terminus of the molecule. Further cleavage of this fragment by treatment with CNBr generated a Mr 35,000 fragment (Pro52-Asp239) that did not interact with PAI-1, and a Mr 6,000 NH2-terminal fragment (Asp1-Met51) that spanned the somatomedin B domain and contained the RGD (cell binding) sequence. The purified Mr 6,000 fragment competed with immobilized Vn for PAI-1 binding, and formed complexes with activated PAI-1. These complexes could be immunoprecipitated by antibodies to PAI-1. Synthetic peptides containing the RGD sequence had no effect on the binding of this fragment to PAI-1. These results suggest that the cell-binding and PAI-1 binding sequences of Vn occupy distinct regions in the NH2-terminal somatomedin B domain of the molecule."
https://openalex.org/W1971344067,"We used retrovirus-mediated gene transfer to study the migration of clonally related cells in the developing chicken optic tectum. Clonal cohorts initially form radial arrays in the ventricular zone (∼ E5), but eventually divide into three separate migratory streams. In the first migration, a minor population of cells migrates tangentially along axon fascicles in medio-laterally directed files (∼ E6–E7); these eventually differentiate into multipolar efferent cells. After E7, the majority of cells in each clone migrate radially along fascicles of radial glia to form the tectal plate, wherein they differentiate into neurons and astrocytes. Around E9, a set of small cells leaves the radial arrays in superficial layers to form a second tangential migration; at least some of these differentiate into astrocytes. Thus, as the tectum develops, cells derived from a single multipotential precursor migrate along three separate pathways, follow separate guidance cues, and adopt distinct phenotypes."

Syncytium formation of HIV-infected T cells was essentially eliminated in the presence of M. fermentans (incognitus strain), despite prominent cell death. However, replication and production of HIV-1 particles continued during the coinfection. Furthermore, the supernatant from cultures coinfected with HIV-1 and the mycoplasma contained a factor that inhibited the standard reverse transcriptase enzyme assay. The modification of the biological properties of HIV-1 by coinfection with mycoplasma may be involved in the pathogenesis of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)."
https://openalex.org/W2041032992,"We have characterized at the molecular level several polar mutations in four different cistrons of the his operon of S. typhimurium. An analysis of the his-specific transcripts produced in vivo In the mutant strains, together with in vitro transcription assays, led to the identification of several cryptic Rho-dependent transcription termination elements within the his operon that are activated by the uncoupling of transcription and translation. Common features of these elements were sought and found with a computer program. We have identified a consensus motif, consisting of a cytosine-rich and guanosine-poor region, that is located upstream of the heterogeneous 3′ endpoints of the prematurely terminated in vivo transcripts and that is present in all the Rho-dependent transcription terminators described thus far."
https://openalex.org/W1568817338,"A 116-kDa polypeptide has recently been found to be a common component of vacuolar proton pumps isolated from a variety of sources. The 116-kDa subunit of the proton pump was purified from clathrin-coated vesicles of bovine brain, and internal sequences were obtained from proteolytic peptides. Oligonucleotide probes designed from these peptide sequences were utilized in polymerase chain reactions to isolate partial bovine cDNA clones for the protein. Sequences from these were then utilized to isolate rat brain cDNA clones containing the full-length coding region. RNA blots indicate the presence of an abundant 3.9-kilobase message for the 116-kDa subunit in brain, and primer extension analysis demonstrates that the cloned sequence is full-length. The rat cDNA sequences predict synthesis of a protein of 96,267 Da. Analysis of the deduced amino acid sequence of the 116-kDa subunit suggests that it consists of two fundamental domains: a hydrophilic amino-terminal half that is composed of greater than 30% charged residues, and a hydrophobic carboxyl-terminal half that contains at least six transmembrane regions. The structural properties of the 116-kDa proton pump polypeptide agree well with its proposed function in coupling ATP hydrolysis by the cytoplasmic subunits to proton translocation by the intramembranous components of the pump."
https://openalex.org/W1574916661,"Hexabrachion (Tenascin) is a large glycoprotein that appears in extracellular matrices as a disulfide-linked multimer. It is synthesized in an ordered fashion at particular sites during development, is made in large amounts by certain tumors, and is found in restricted tissue locations in the adult. In this report, we describe the sequence of a full length cDNA of human hexabrachion. The encoded protein contains a total of 2203 amino acids and is a linear array of discrete reiterated domains. At the 5' end are encoded hydrophobic residues and 8 flanking cysteines predicted to be responsible for assembly of hexabrachion polypeptides into a radially arranged, six-armed complex. Following this region are 14 1/2 contiguous 31-amino acid epidermal growth factor-like repeats that have a unique structure with respect to the known examples of this type of domain. Immediately adjacent to these repeats lie 15 uninterrupted segments of approximately 90 amino acids which are similar to the Type III units found in fibronectin. At the carboxyl terminus of the protein is a 210-amino acid domain that is similar to fibrinogen. The domain structure of this protein is consistent with the potential for interaction with multiple ligands and for roles in cell adhesion and/or signaling."
https://openalex.org/W1586626136,"The definition of epitopes on apoA-I provides evidence for a very dense packing of the peptide chain and supports the proposed supersecondary structure, made of repetitive antiparallel helices. Screening with overlapping synthetic hexapeptides shows that only a few epitopes are continuous and that all continuous contact sequences identified within the epitopes coincide or are contiguous to a putative beta-turn, such as residues 1-8, 48-55, 98-104, 118-123, and 135-140. On the N-terminal half of apoA-I we identified 6 overlapping tertiary discontinuous epitopes, uniquely constituted by amino acids and discontinuous sequences on helical segments that are far apart and which define a particular region with a complex tertiary structure. Among these are the epitopes for antibody 5G6, which reacts with residues 45-51, 83-92, 119-126, and 136-143; for A16, which reacts with 14-19, 23-28, and 60-82; and for r-FC1, which reacts with 1-8, 29-35, 78-83, and 98-121. The very far apart discontinuous sequences included in these epitopes can be explained by the predicted turns and coiled domains, and thus provide evidence for such a tertiary structure. Alternatively, these results could also be explained by intermolecular epitopes involving the N-terminal region. In contrast, in the middle of apoA-I, all identified epitopes are shorter and discontinuous within the secondary structure and are constituted by residues forming a beta-turn with all or part of an adjacent alpha-helix. We hypothesize that these multiple epitopes, that are mostly limited to a single helix, reflect the existence of a very mobile domain, possibly with hinged pairs of adjacent alpha-helices. On the C-terminal half of apoA-I, several monoclonal antibodies react with overlapping epitopes located between residues 149 and 186, which probably reflects 2 antiparallel alpha-helices interrupted by a beta-turn."
https://openalex.org/W1562141381,"A homology probing approach was utilized to isolate a new human protein kinase. Deoxyoligonucleotide probes recognizing a conserved subdomain in the COOH-terminal portion of protein kinases identified a cDNA clone encoding a putative kinase with predicted serine/threonine phosphorylation specificity. The full-length, 1.7-kilobase pair cDNA hybridizes to 1.7- and 3.4-kilobase mRNA transcripts in a number of tissues. The size of the encoded protein is 454 amino acids and consists of an NH2-terminal 130-residue segment, which may represent a regulatory region, followed by a 324-residue catalytic domain. Comparisons and alignments of the primary sequence and predicted secondary structure of the catalytic region to other known kinases reveal that the new kinase, denoted CLK (for CDC-like kinase), represents a prototype for a new family of human protein kinases bearing significant homology to the yeast cdc2/CDC28 kinases that regulate the cell cycle."
https://openalex.org/W1579829228,"Human cDNA was mutagenized to duplicate six naturally occurring mutations in the gene for glucocere-brosidase. The mutant genes were expressed in NIH 3T3 cells. The abnormal human enzymes were purified by immunoaffinity chromatography and characterized. The Asn370—-Ser mutant protein differed from normal enzyme in its inhibition by both conduritol B epoxide and glucosphingosine demonstrating that the 370 mutant enzyme has an abnormal catalytic site. In addition, the 370 mutant enzyme is less activated by saposin C, but more stimulated by phosphatidylserine than the wild type enzyme. The Arg463—-Cys mutant protein was normal with respect to conduritol B epoxide and glucosphingosine inhibition, but was less activated by both saposin C and phosphatidylserine. The Arg120—-Gln mutant protein was catalytically inactive. The Leu444—-Pro, the pseudopattern, and the Pro415—-Arg mutants appear to have reduced amounts of enzyme protein in cells. The studies demonstrated that mutations in the gene for glucocerebrosidase have different effects on the catalytic activity and stability of the enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W2070373359,"Saimiri monkeys immunized with a recombinant protein containing 20 copies of the nine amino acid repeat of the Plasmodium vivax circumsporozoite (CS) protein developed high concentrations of antibodies to the repeat sequence and to sporozoites, but were not protected against challenge. After intravenous injection of an immunoglobulin G3 monoclonal antibody (NVS3) against irradiated P. vivax sporozoites, four of six monkeys were protected against sporozoite-induced malaria, and the remaining two animals took significantly longer to become parasitemic. Epitope mapping demonstrated that NVS3 recognizes only four (AGDR) of the nine amino acids within the repeat region of the P. vivax CS protein. The monkeys immunized with (DRAADGQPAG)20 did not produce antibodies to the protective epitope AGDR. Thus, determination of the fine specificity of protective immune responses may be critical to the construction of successful subunit vaccines."
https://openalex.org/W1603793449,"Charybdotoxin (ChTX) inhibits with high affinity a voltage-gated K+ channel that is present in human T lymphocytes. In this system, 125I-ChTX binds specifically and reversibly to a single class of sites which display a Kd of 8-14 pM, as measured by either equilibrium or kinetic binding protocols. The maximum density of sites, 542 sites/cell, correlates well with the density of K+ channel as determined by electrophysiological experiments. Binding of 125I-ChTX is modulated by the ionic strength of the incubation media and by Ca2+. Increasing concentrations of either K+, Na+, or Ca2+ cause inhibition of toxin binding. Inhibition of binding by Ca2+ is due, primarily, to an effect on toxin dissociation rates. Increasing the pH of the external media from 6.8 to 8.5 enhances toxin binding, due to an increase in affinity with no significant effect on the maximum density of receptor sites. Different agents that block the voltage-gated K+ channel in human T lymphocytes, inhibit toxin binding. Mitogen-stimulated T cells display 2.5-3-fold increase in toxin binding as compared with unstimulated control cells. These data, taken together, suggest that 125I-ChTX binding sites identified in this study, represent the predominant voltage-gated K+ channel present in peripheral human T lymphocytes. Therefore, 125I-ChTX is a useful probe for elucidating the physiological role of this type of K+ channel."
https://openalex.org/W1493922330,"The product of the altered mRNA stability (ams) gene of Escherichia coli is involved in decay of mRNA. The complete nucleotide sequence of a 4-kilobase BamHI restriction fragment containing the ams coding sequence was determined. Transcription of the ams gene was analyzed by high resolution S1 mapping. A promoter was found with a homology score of 58% 361 nucleotides upstream from the start codon of ams. The ams structural gene consists of an open reading frame of 2,445 nucleotides. The protein predicted from this open reading frame has a molecular mass of 91,327 Da, which is significantly smaller than that determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis. Confirmation of the ams coding sequence was obtained by comparing the predicted amino acid sequence with that derived by amino-terminal analysis of gel-purified Ams protein. The predicted protein sequence of the ams gene was screened against translations of the GenBank DNA sequence data base. A homology of 18% over a region of 315 amino acids of the carboxyl terminus of the Ams product was found to MRP3, a mitochondrial ribosomal protein from Neurospora crassa. A smaller region of homology (29% in 86 residues) was found to the human U1 small nuclear ribonucleoparticle 70,000-Da protein."

https://openalex.org/W1569348957,"Lysyl hydroxylase (EC 1.14.11.4), an alpha 2 dimer, catalyzes the formation of hydroxylysine in collagens by the hydroxylation of lysine residues in X-Lys-Gly sequences. We report here on the isolation of cDNA clones coding for the enzyme from a chick embryo lambda gt11 library. Several overlapping clones covering all the coding sequences of the 4-kilobase mRNA and virtually all the noncoding sequences were characterized. These clones encode a polypeptide of 710 amino acid residues and a signal peptide of 20 amino acids. The polypeptide has four potential attachment sites for asparagine-linked oligosaccharides and 9 cysteine residues, at least one of which is likely to be involved in the binding of the Fe2+ atom to a catalytic site. A surprising finding was that no significant homology was found between the primary structures of lysyl hydroxylase and prolyl 4-hydroxylase in spite of the marked similarities in kinetic properties between these two enzymes. A computer-assisted comparison indicated only an 18% identity between lysyl hydroxylase and the alpha-subunit of prolyl 4-hydroxylase and a 19% identity between lysyl hydroxylase and the beta-subunit of prolyl 4-hydroxylase. Visual inspection of the most homologous areas nevertheless indicated the presence of several regions of 20-40 amino acids in which the identity between lysyl hydroxylase and one of the prolyl 4-hydroxylase subunits exceeded 30% or similarity exceeded 40%. Southern blot analyses of chick genomic DNA indicated the presence of only one gene coding for lysyl hydroxylase."
https://openalex.org/W1583513661,"Exendin-3 increased cellular cAMP levels and amylase release from dispersed acini from guinea pig pancreas. Low concentrations (0.1-3 nM) caused a 12-fold increase in cAMP, whereas higher concentrations (0.3-3 microM) caused an additional 24-fold increase in cAMP. Maximal cAMP with the highest concentration tested was the same as the maximal response with secretin, vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), peptide histidine isoleucine, helodermin, or helospectin-I. In terms of amylase release, exendin-3 had the same efficacy but was the least potent of these peptides. Exendin-3-induced increases in amylase release were inhibited by VIP receptor antagonists and the new peptide (greater than 0.1 microM) competed with radiolabeled VIP for binding sites on dispersed acini. Increasing concentrations of an exendin-3 fragment, exendin-3(9-39) amide, did not increase cAMP or amylase release but inhibited the increase in cAMP observed with 0.1-3 nM exendin-3. The fragment did not alter the effects of other peptides that are known to increase acinar cAMP. We conclude that exendin-3 interacts with at least two receptors on guinea pig pancreatic acini; at high concentrations (greater than 100 nM) the peptide interacts with VIP receptors, thereby causing a large increase in cAMP and stimulating amylase release; at lower concentrations (0.1-3 nM) the peptide interacts with a putative exendin receptor, thereby causing a smaller increase in cAMP of undetermined function. Exendin-3(9-39) amide is a specific exendin receptor antagonist."

https://openalex.org/W1489443508,"Expression of the repZ gene involved in DNA replication of the ColIb-P9 plasmid depends on translation of a transcribed repZ leader sequence (repY) and is negatively regulated by Inc RNA, the product of the inc gene and a countertranscript to RepZ mRNA. To further understand the regulatory loop of repZ expression, we isolated and characterized replication-defective ColIb-P9 mutants that affected the level of repZ expression. Here we report that mutations occurring in two complementary sequences, one (5'GGCG3') in the inc region and one in the repY region, reduce the level of repZ expression without affecting transcription. The mutations in one complementary sequence were suppressed by compensatory base changes in the other sequence, restoring the ability of repZ expression. These results indicated that interaction by base pairing between the two complementary sequences of RepZ mRNA was essential for repZ translation. The two sequences, separated by 107 bases from each other, have a potential to form a novel pseudoknot in the RepZ mRNA leader. We also found that some mutations in the 5'GGCG3' sequence altered the specificity of Inc RNA, thereby reducing significantly its regulatory activity. Thus, this single specific sequence is involved in both positive and negative regulations for repZ expression. Possible regulatory mechanisms of repZ expression are discussed."

The oligosaccharides were isolated by gel permeation chromatography and their structures determined by 500-MHz 1H NMR spectroscopy, fast atom bombardment-mass spectrometry, and high-pH anion-exchange chromatography. The high-mannose oligosaccharides Man5GlcNAc2, Man6GlcNAc2, Man7GlcNAc2, Man8GlcNAc2, and Man9GlcNAc2 were present in the ratios 2:49:19:24:6 and accounted for all the asparagine-linked oligosaccharides released from Art v II by PNGase F. The NH2-terminal amino acid sequences of Art v II and of four peptides generated by cyanogen bromide (CNBr) cleavage of deglycosylated Art v II were determined. The first 30 amino acid residues of Art v II did not contain any potential N-glycosylation sites. One potential N-glycosylation site was identified in one of the CNBr fragments. The native protein conformation was shown by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay inhibition assays to be essential for the binding of rabbit IgG to Art v II and for the binding of human IgE to the major IgE-binding epitope(s) in this allergen. At least one minor IgE-binding epitope still bound IgE after denaturation of the allergen. Removal of the high-mannose chains from denatured Art v II had no significant effect on the binding of human IgE to the minor IgE-binding epitope(s)."
https://openalex.org/W1544426827,"Abstract The gene defective in fibrosis has recently been shown to code for a membrane protein designated the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) protein. While it has been shown that detectable levels of the mRNA for the normal CFTR protein are present in epithelial cells from different tissues, factors which regulate CFTR expression have not been identified. A clonal cell line originating from a human colon adenocarcinoma (HT29-18) differentiates to multiple epithelial cell types when deprived of glucose in the culture medium. In these studies, mRNA isolated from these cells was examined by hybridization to a 1.45-kilobase cDNA probe which encodes transmembrane portions of the CFTR protein between exons 13 and 19. Cellular differentiation of HT29-18 causes a 9-18-fold increase in CFTR mRNA abundance versus the mRNA for the structural proteins actin and tubulin. Cellular differentiation also causes a 5-fold increase in second messenger-regulated Cl- transport which is sensitive to a Cl- channel blocker (diphenylamine 2-carboxylate). Subclones of HT29-18 which are committed to differentiate to either a mucin-secreting (HT29-18-N2) or an enterocyte-like (HT29-18-C1) phenotype have also been examined. In both subclones, elevated levels of CFTR mRNA are observed when compared with undifferentiated HT29-18 cells. However, during cellular differentiation, the regulation of CFTR mRNA abundance and membrane enzyme expression by the subclones is different from HT29-18. The results show that elevated CFTR mRNA occurs in multiple differentiated intestinal epithelial cell types, despite a phenotype-specific regulation of membrane protein expression. This suggests that CFTR expression plays a role in the differentiated functions of multiple epithelial phenotypes and that both cellular differentiation and cellular phenotypes are factors which regulate CFTR expression."

These model substrates were used to investigate the role in charging of N73, the unpaired nucleotide that is just three positions removed from the amino acid attachment site and which is sometimes referred to as the base. Previous work showed that, while substrates which encode G3:U70 are all charged by alanine tRNA synthetase regardless of the base at position 73, catalytic efficiency is substantially higher with substrates that have the wild-type A73. To identify a specific step in aminoacylation that is affected by substitutions of A73, we studied the single turnover charging of A73, U73, C73, and G73 minihelices, using preformed, enzyme-bound alanyl adenylate and saturating concentrations of the respective minihelices. Compared to the A73 substrate, the transfer of activated amino acid to bound RNA is sharply reduced for the substituted N73 minihelices. The low efficiency of transfer is not due to an abortive reaction in which the adenylate or a transiently charged RNA is hydrolyzed. Instead, under the conditions used, the active adenylate remains on the enzyme for extended periods and simply reacts slowly with bound N73 RNA. The results suggest that the nature of the discriminator base is a critical determinant of the transition state for the reaction of bound alanyl adenylate with RNA on the surface of the enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1504291265,"Abstract The genes for trophoblast interferons (IFN) bovine trophoblast protein-1 (bTP-1) and ovine trophoblast protein-1 (oTP-1) are expressed massively in the trophectoderm of preimplantation bovine and ovine concepti during the period of maternal recognition of pregnancy. These 172-amino acid IFN are closely related to the IFN-alpha II, a family of long IFN expressed in virus-induced leukocytes. Genomic Southern blotting with a full-length bTP-1 cDNA revealed about 15 genes that bind the probe with varying intensities. By using more specific probes for the 3'-ends of the cDNA, we have shown that only four to five of these represent bTP-1 genes, whereas no more than another four are IFN-alpha II. Genes for bTP-1 and IFN-alpha II, all of which are intronless, have been isolated from bovine genomic libraries, and their nucleotide sequences were compared. Additional bTP-1 genes and two distinct oTP-1 genes have been isolated from bovine and ovine genomic DNA by using the polymerase chain reaction procedure in conjunction with specific 3'- and 5'- primers (derived from the bTP-1 gene sequences determined above). The promoter region up to 100 bases upstream from the transcription start sites of the trophoblast IFN are almost completely conserved across different genes and across species, yet show only limited sequence identity with IFN-alpha II. Two putative binding regions for interferon regulatory factor-1 as well as several GAAANN motifs (where N is any nucleotide) that have been implicated in viral responsiveness of alpha 1- and beta-IFN genes are retained at identical positions in all of the trophoblast genes. Putative interferon regulatory factor-1-binding nucleotide hexamers and GAAANN motifs are also present in the IFN-alpha II genes, but these are organized very differently than in the trophoblast IFN genes. A GAAATG motif is present in IFN-alpha II promoters but is absent in trophoblast IFN genes. Based on the evidence presented, it is proposed that the trophoblast interferons constitute a separate subclass of IFN-alpha distinct from IFN-alpha II and IFN-alpha I."
https://openalex.org/W2020395016,"Influx of Ca2+ through NMDA channels may initiate the stabilization of coactive synapses during development of the retinotectal projection in frogs. Ca2+ imaging techniques were applied to cultured tectal cells to investigate whether excitatory amino acids cause a rise in [Ca2+]i. High [K+], NMDA, and glutamate increase [Ca2+]i in about 75% of the cells. NMDA and glutamate responses were completely blocked in the absence of extracellular Ca2+ and by the NMDA receptor or channel blockers APV and MK-801. The NMDA response was also blocked by Mg2+. Quisqualate and kainate produced little or no rise in [Ca2+]i. These studies indicate that when tectal cells are exposed to the retinal ganglion cell transmitter glutamate, the predominant means of Ca2+ entry is through NMDA channels."
https://openalex.org/W1542499797,"The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae catalytic DNA polymerase I 180-kDa subunit and the tightly associated 86-kDa polypeptide have been purified using immunoaffinity chromatography, permitting further characterization of the DNA polymerase activity of the DNA primase-DNA polymerase protein complex. The subunits were purified to apparent homogeneity from separate overproducing yeast strains using monoclonal antibodies specifically recognizing each subunit. When the individual subunits were recombined in vitro a p86p180 physical complex formed spontaneously, as judged by immunoprecipitation of 180-kDa polypeptide and DNA polymerase activity with the anti-86-kDa monoclonal antibody. The 86-kDa subunit stabilized the DNA polymerase activity of the 180-kDa catalytic subunit at 30 degrees C, the physiological temperature. The apparent DNA polymerase processivity of 50-60 nucleotides on poly(dA).oligo(dT)12 or poly(dT).oligo(A)8-12 template-primer was not affected by the presence of the 86-kDa subunit but was reduced by increased Mg2+ concentration. The Km of the catalytic 180-kDa subunit for dATP or DNA primer terminus was unaffected by the presence of the 86-kDa subunit. The isolated 180-kDa polypeptide was sufficient to catalyze all the DNA synthesis that had been observed previously in the DNA primase-DNA polymerase protein complex. The 180-kDa subunit possessed a 3'----5'-exonuclease activity that catalyzed degradation of polynucleotides, but degradation of oligonucleotide substrates of chain lengths up to 50 was not detected. This exonuclease activity was unaffected by the presence of the 86-kDa subunit. Despite the striking physical similarity of the DNA primase-DNA polymerase protein complex in all eukaryotes examined, the data presented here indicate differences in the enzymatic properties detected in preparations of the DNA polymerase subunits isolated from S. cerevisiae as compared with the properties of preparations from Drosophila cells. In particular, the 3'----5'-exonuclease activity associated with the yeast catalytic DNA polymerase subunit was not masked by the 86-kDa subunit."
https://openalex.org/W1598536901,"Catabolism of plasminogen activators by Hep G2 cells is mediated by a specific receptor which recognizes complexes of these serine proteases with their physiological inhibitor, plasminogen activator inhibitor type-1 (PAI-1). This catabolic process is initiated by interaction of exogenous plasminogen activators with bioactive PAI-1, which is secreted and localizes in an active form to the extracellular matrix (ECM) of Hep G2 cells. We now report that vitronectin (VN) mediates the specific binding of PAI-1 to the ECM of these cells. Purified bovine or human VN competes for specific binding of PAI-1 to Hep G2 ECM, and ligand blotting reveals specific binding of PAI-1 to ECM-associated VN. Hep G2 cells secrete both VN and PAI-1, and pulse-chase studies strongly suggest that these proteins associate only following secretion. Although Hep G2 cell-derived VN does not significantly bind to ECM in vitro, 30-40% of endogenous PAI-1 binds to the ECM, even in the presence of human serum, suggesting that ECM-associated VN is entirely derived from bovine serum. PAI-1 was localized by indirect immunofluorescence to ECM beneath cells and at cell margins, whereas VN exhibited a uniform distribution throughout the growth substratum. VN associated with the ECM may confer retention and bioactivity to PAI-1, potentially facilitating both pericellular regulation of plasmin generation and the rapid hepatic clearance of plasminogen activators."
https://openalex.org/W1556724116,"Alu and 7SL RNA gene sequences were tested for the potential to regulate mammalian cell growth by introducing these sequences into HeLa cells in a coupled DEAE-dextran transfection/affinity cell sorting system. Both Alu and 7SL RNA genes mediated inhibition of [3H]thymidine and [35S]methionine incorporation in recipient cells. In addition, short term growth curves were performed on calcium phosphate/DNA cotransfected, affinity-purified cells. This second assay revealed that transfected Alu and 7SL RNA can also cause suppression of HeLa cell proliferation. To investigate whether transcription or polymerase III (pol III) transcription factor binding was required for inhibitory activity, mutations were introduced into RNA pol III B block promoter elements in each of these genes. Suppression of [3H]thymidine incorporation was dependent on the presence of this pol III element in both genes; likewise, 7SL RNA-mediated growth suppression required the presence of the pol III B block promoter element. The results of this study indicate that Alu and 7SL RNA gene sequences interact with cellular factors that are important for HeLa cell proliferation and suggest that these pol III-transcribed elements may be involved in the regulation of cellular growth."
https://openalex.org/W1553834317,"The monoclonal antibody AG6 was raised against HUVE cells and was confirmed as recognizing CD13 (aminopeptidase N) by its reactivity with the CD13 cDNA transfectant pipz 4. However, in sequential immunoprecipitation studies with another anti-CD13 monoclonal, WM15, neither was able to completely remove the molecules recognized by the other. As both monoclonals recognize the same cDNA transfectant, the differences cannot be in the amino acid sequence, suggesting that the CD13 subpopulations have glycosylation differences. Neither neuraminidase and endoglycosidase H treatment of the immunoprecipitates, nor tunicamycin and monensin treatment of proliferating cells differentiated the molecular subpopulations. The epitopes are protein and not carbohydrate as both monoclonals were able to precipitate deglycosylated CD13 from tunicamycin- and monensin-treated cells and o-glycanase-treated purified CD13. Sequential immunoprecipitation studies with WM15 and AG6 of pipz 4 and purified o-glycanase-treated CD13 showed that the subpopulations were due to the O-linked oligosaccharides. Sequential immunoprecipitations with seven other CD13 monoclonals show that there are at least five subpopulations of CD13. It is postulated that the differences between the subpopulations are due to differential utilization of glycosylation sites or subtle differences in oligosaccharide composition causing variable masking of protein epitopes. Similar observations with the integrin group of molecules suggests that this may be an example of a more general phenomenon among glycoproteins."
https://openalex.org/W1493891063,"There is increasing evidence that protein folding and protein export are competing processes in prokaryotic cells. Virtually all secretion studies reported to date, however, have employed proteins that are relatively uncharacterized in terms of their folding behavior and three-dimensional structure. In contrast, the structural and biochemical parameters governing the folding of bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor (BPTI) and several of its mutants have been studied intensively. We therefore undertook a study of the secretion behavior in Escherichia coli of recombinant BPTI and its mutants. Wild-type BPTI and two well-characterized folding mutants (C14A, C38A)BPTI and (C30A, C51A)BPTI (missing the 14-38 and 30-51 disulfide bonds, respectively), were investigated by analyzing their expression fused to an E. coli signal sequence or to two synthetic IgG-binding domains of staphylococcal protein A. Both disulfide mutants are destabilized relative to wild-type BPTI and exhibit markedly altered folding kinetics: one (C14A, C38A) folds more slowly than wild-type BPTI and the other (C30A, C51A) unfolds more rapidly. Both mutants were observed to be exported 3-10 times more efficiently than the wild-type molecule. Moreover, the levels of unprocessed preprotein in the cytoplasm were severalfold higher for the wild-type fusion than for the fusion to the two folding mutants. Intracellular degradation of the BPTI moiety was also observed. These results are consistent with traffic of intracellular BPTI preproteins on at least three routes along the secretory pathway: (a) facile secretion of unfolded material, (b) intracellular folding leading to secretion blockage, and (c) degradation followed by export of truncated molecules. A novel feature of these findings is the implication that disulfide bonds can form in the bacterial cytoplasm and lead to secretion incompetence."
https://openalex.org/W1519204479,"A phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C (PI-PLC) has been isolated from bovine brain (purification factor of 5.6 x 10(4)). By sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, it had a Mr of 57,000. Neither amino nor neutral sugars were detected in the purified enzyme. The pH optimum was 7.0-7.5, and the activity decreased only slightly at pH 8.0. When phosphatidylinositol was used as a substrate, the optimum Ca2+ requirement was 4 mM, and Km was 260 microM. When phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate was used, the optimum Ca2+ requirement was 10(-7) M, and the Km was reduced to 90 microM. Lipid specificity studies showed that equal amounts of inositol phosphate and diacylglycerol were released from phosphatidylinositol but 4 times as much inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate was released from phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate. Other lipids, phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, and sphingomyelin, were not substrates. Failure to detect phosphatidic acid confirmed the absence of a phospholipase D activity in the purified enzyme. Myelin basic protein (MBP) stimulated the PI-PLC activity between 2- and 3-fold. Histone had a small effect only, whereas bovine serum albumin and cytochrome C had no effect. Phosphorylation of MBP reduced the stimulatory effect. Protein-protein interactions between MBP and PI-PLC have been demonstrated both immunologically and by sucrose density gradients. A stoichiometry of 1:1 has been suggested by the latter method. A number of peptides have been prepared by chemical, enzymatic, and synthetic methods. Peptides containing the MBP sequences consisting of residues 24-33 and 114-122 stimulated the PI-PLC but were less effective than the intact protein."
https://openalex.org/W1593416864,"Three different orientations of non-blue, type 2 cupric complexes on DNA fibers are obtained from EPR data. The cupric complex of bleomycin, CuBlm, binds as described previously (Shields, H., McGlumphy,C., and Hamrick, P., J., Jr. (1982) Biochim. Biophys. Acta 697, 113-120), except possibly with more restricted motion. The square plane of CuBlm makes an angle of about 65 degrees with the fiber axis. The tridentate complex 2-formylpyridine monothiosemicarbazonato Cu2+ binds with its planar structure perpendicular to the fiber axis. In contrast, other tridentate cupric complexes of tripeptides, CuGHK and CuGHG, bind with the square plane parallel to the fiber axis. The bound forms of Cu(GHK) and Cu(GHG) are determined mostly by the GH moiety in the complex; the contribution of lysine in defining the orientation of the copper moiety is minimal. Thus, the structure of the ligand determines the orientation of these complexes on DNA."

https://openalex.org/W1581972297,"We previously reported that uncoupling Ca2+-loaded mitochondria in the presence of [ethylenebis(oxyethylenenitrilo)]tetraacetic acid (EGTA) produces a partial expression of the permeability transition. From this and related observations, it was proposed that the absence of external free Ca2+ is inhibitory to reverse activity of the Ca2+ uniporter (Igbavboa, U., and Pfeiffer, D.R. (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 1405-1412). By using Sr2+-instead of Ca2+-loaded mitochondria, the transition is avoided upon treatment with EGTA plus uncoupler, and inhibition of reverse uniport activity can be observed directly. In the presence of physiological Mg2+ concentrations, reverse uniport of Sr2+ is eliminated by external EGTA following a brief period of rapid activity. It is proposed that binding of Mg2+ rather than Sr2+ (Ca2+) at an external site is responsible for the inhibition. Regulation at the external site is modified by the size of the Sr2+ load. EGTA, in the presence of Mg2+, does not inhibit the reverse uniport-dependent release of Sr2+ from mitoplasts. The inhibitory effect can be recovered by adding back the soluble components obtained as the intermembrane space fraction following removal of the outer membrane. The soluble factor could be a regulatory subunit which contains the external cation binding site. Adjustments to uniporter activity due to regulation by the binding site and/or the soluble factor may be slow and may be significant in determining how mitochondria respond to rapid Ca2+ transients in vivo."

https://openalex.org/W1561318970,"Abstract The antiviral/antiproliferative/antitumor properties of interferon (IFN) are potentiated by a febrile temperature (Heron, I., and Berg, K. (1978) Nature 274, 508-510; Fleischmann, W. R., Fleischmann, C. M., Jr., and Gindhart, T. D. (1986) Cancer Res. 46, 1722-1726; Groveman, D. S., Borden, E. C., Merritt, J. A., Robins, H. I., Steeves, R., and Bryan, G. T. (1984) Cancer Res. 44, 5517-5521). To investigate the role of 2',5'-oligoadenylate (2-5A) synthetase in linking temperature with these biological functions of IFN, antiviral activities and expression of the 2-5A synthetase gene were measured simultaneously in control and type I IFN-treated HL-60 and WISH cells at the selected elevated temperature of 39.5 degrees C +/- 0.5 degrees C (herein referred to as hyperthermia). In both cell lines, the IFN-mediated antiviral effect was enhanced 3-10-fold. Concurrently, enzymatic assays and immunoblot analyses with an anti-40-kDa synthetase antibody clearly gave a 2-3-fold increase of synthetase above that observed at the normal cell culture temperature (37 degrees C). These results suggest that potentiation of 2-5A synthetase must partially account for the enhanced antiviral activity of IFN at the higher cell culture temperature. The supranormal elevation of 2-5A synthetase was accompanied by a parallel increase in the steady-state concentration of 2-5A synthetase mRNA, which is likely to contribute to the observed increase in enzyme level. Transient reporter gene expression studies using plasmid constructs carrying 2-5A synthetase gene promoter linked in tandem with chloramphenicol acetyltransferase showed that IFN-inducible chloramphenicol acetyltransferase activity was not influenced by hyperthermia, suggesting that transcription activation is an unlikely explanation for the observed 2-5A synthetase mRNA level increases. Messenger RNA stability assays showed that the half-life (t1/2) of 2-5A synthetase mRNA was extended from 2 to 4 h at 39.5 degrees C. Under identical conditions, the t1/2 of poly(A)+ RNA remained unchanged whereas the t1/2 of beta-actin mRNA was reduced. Taken together, these results are consistent with the interpretation that selective stabilization of 2-5A synthetase mRNA at the elevated temperature is a major factor contributing to the potentiation of antiviral activity of IFN by hyperthermia."
https://openalex.org/W1565369530,"Human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) reverse transcriptase has been found to conduct error-prone synthesis on DNA and RNA templates. We find here that tolerance of an A:G mispair with poly(rA) as template is particularly strong, such that extensive poly(dG) synthesis is conducted. This type of extensive misincorporation is not observed with several reference DNA polymerases. Surprisingly, HIV reverse transcriptase processivity and kcat for dGMP misincorporation and normal dTMP incorporation are about the same. However, the Km value for dGTP in poly(dG) synthesis is approximately 1000-fold higher than the Km for dTTP in poly(dT) synthesis. Comparison of thermodynamic parameters for dGMP misincorporation and normal dNMP incorporation indicates a lower energy of activation for dGMP misincorporation than for normal dNMP incorporation. Entropy of activation (delta S*) for normal dTMP incorporation is positive (approximately 10 cal/kmol), whereas delta S* for dGMP misincorporation is negative (-36 cal/kmol). Since differences in delta S* are usually considered to reflect differences in solvation for the transition state complex, these results are consistent with the interpretation that the active site of HIV reverse transcriptase is flexible enough to misincorporate dGMP without the usual dispersion of water molecules."
