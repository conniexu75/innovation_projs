https://openalex.org/W2070360032,"Foreign DNA fragments can be inserted into filamentous phage gene III to create a fusion protein with the foreign sequence in the middle. The fusion protein is incorporated into the virion, which retains infectivity and displays the foreign amino acids in immunologically accessible form. These ""fusion phage"" can be enriched more than 1000-fold over ordinary phage by affinity for antibody directed against the foreign sequence. Fusion phage may provide a simple way of cloning a gene when an antibody against the product of that gene is available."
https://openalex.org/W2092464006,"Most of the nuclear genome of warm-blooded vertebrates is a mosaic of very long (> > 200 kilobases) DNA segments, the isochores; these isochores are fairly homogeneous in base composition and belong to a small number of major classes distinguished by differences in guanine-cytosine (GC) content. The families of DNA molecules derived from such classes can be separated and used to study the genome distribution of any sequence which can be probed. This approach has revealed (i) that the distribution of genes, integrated viral sequences, and interspersed repeats is highly nonuniform in the genome, and (ii) that the base composition and ratio of CpG to GpC in both coding and noncoding sequences, as well as codon usage, mainly depend on the GC content of the isochores harboring the sequences. The compositional compartmentalization of the genome of warm-blooded vertebrates is discussed with respect to its evolutionary origin, its causes, and its effects on chromosome structure and function."

https://openalex.org/W2035306557,"The mixture of a few horizontal and vertical line segments embedded in an aggregate of diagonal line segments can be rapidly counted and their positions rapidly determined by a parallel (preattentive) process. However, the discrimination between horizontal and vertical orientation (that is, discrimination of a single conspicuous feature) requires serial search by focal attention. Under recent theories of attention, focal attention has been assumed to be required for the recognition of different combinations of features. According to the findings of this experiment, knowing ""what"" even a single feature is requires time-consuming search by focal attention. Only knowing ""where"" a target it is mediated by a parallel process."

The processes causing irreversible inactivation of hen egg-white lysozyme at 100 degrees C are deamidation of asparagine residues, hydrolysis of peptide bonds at aspartic acid residues., destruction of disulfide bonds, and formation of incorrect (scrambled) structures; their relative contributions depend of the pH."
https://openalex.org/W2034248536,"While a number of oncogenes are expressed in a cell cycle-dependent manner, their role in the control of cell proliferation can only be established by a direct functional assay. The c-myc protein, upon microinjection into nuclei of quiescent Swiss 3T3 cells, cooperated with platelet-poor plasma in the stimulation of cellular DNA synthesis. This suggests that c-myc protein, like platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), may act as a competence factor in the cell cycle to promote the progression of cells to S phase. The presence in the medium of an antibody against PDGF abolished DNA synthesis induced by microinjected PDGF; however, the microinjected c-myc protein stimulated DNA synthesis even when its own antibody was present in the medium. The c-myc protein may act as an intracellular competence factor, while PDGF expresses its biological activity only from outside the cells."

https://openalex.org/W1982040682,"Direct scanning electron microscopy of material obtained during surgical debridement of osteomyelitic bone showed that the infecting bacteria grew in coherent microcolonies in an adherent biofilm so extensive it often obscured the infected bone surfaces. Transmission electron microscopy showed this biofilm to have a fibrous matrix, to contain some host cells, and to contain many bacteria around which matrix fibers were often concentrated. Many bacterial morphotypes were present in these biofilms, and each bacterium was surrounded by exopolysaccharide polymers, which are known to mediate formation of microcolonies and adhesion of bacteria to surfaces in natural ecosystems and in infections related biomaterials. The adherent mode of growth may reduce the susceptibility of these organisms to host clearance mechanisms and antibiotic therapy and thus may be a fundamental factor in acute and chronic osteomyelitis."

https://openalex.org/W1507170913,"Laminin, a major structural glycoprotein of basement membranes, has been found to self-associate in vitro into large polymers. The formation of these complexes can be followed by the development of turbidity upon incubation in neutral phosphate buffer at 21-35 degrees C and is seen to be time-, concentration-, and temperature-dependent. The process is thermally reversible at 4 degrees C and the protein can be cycled between a dispersed and an aggregated state by alternating between 4 and 35 degrees C. Following incubation at 35 degrees C much of the monomeric laminin, which sediments at 11.4 S, is now seen to sediment at greater than 25 S. Both by turbidometric and sedimentation analysis, an apparent critical concentration for assembly of about 0.1 mg/ml (10(-7) M) is observed and is interpreted as evidence for a nucleation-propagation polymerization mechanism. The relative paucity of intermediates seen in a size-distribution analysis lends further support for this model. On platinum replicas obtained by rotary shadowing analysis, mostly free monomers are seen in the cold while after incubation at 35 degrees C, large multimeric aggregates with smaller amounts of oligomers are observed. The interaction between individual molecules appears to be specific because the dimers, trimers, and smaller oligomers are only associated at the terminal globular domains of the laminin molecules. In addition, removal of the globular domains of laminin with pepsin, which yields fragment P1, abolishes self-association. A divalent cation dependency for polymerization can be demonstrated and incubation in the presence of EDTA stops the polymerization at an oligomeric intermediate step. Hence overall laminin self-assembly can be divided into at least two steps: an initial temperature-dependent, divalent cation independent step followed by a divalent cation-dependent step."
https://openalex.org/W1985157666,"Mouse lymphocytes incubated on cryostat-cut sections of lymphoid organs (lymph nodes and Peyer's patches) specifically adhere to the endothelium of high endothelial venules (HEV), the specialized blood vessels to which recirculating lymphocytes attach as they migrate from the blood into the parenchyma of the lymphoid organs. Treatment of sections with sialidase eliminated the binding of lymphocytes to peripheral lymph node HEV, had no effect on binding to Peyer's patch HEV, and had an intermediate effect on mesenteric lymph node HEV. These results suggest that sialic acid on endothelial cells may be an organ-specific recognition determinant for lymphocyte attachment."
https://openalex.org/W2069456480,"Muscle gene expression is induced a few hours after vegetal cells of a Xenopus blastula are placed in contact with animal cells that normally develop into epidermis and nerve cells. We have used a muscle-specific actin gene probe to determine the timing of gene activation in animal-vegetal conjugates. Muscle actin RNA is first transcribed in a minority of animal cells at a stage equivalent to late gastrula. The time of muscle gene activation is determined by the developmental stage of the responding (animal) cells, and not by the time when cells are first placed in contact. The minimal cell contact time required for induction is between 1½ and 2½ hr, and the minimal time for gene activation after induction is 5–7 hr."

https://openalex.org/W2048461084,"Nuclear extracts from adenovirus-infected HeLa cells harvested early in infection demonstrated a markedly increased capacity for transcription by RNA polymerase III of exogenous VA RNA genes, as well as cloned tRNA and 5S RNA genes. In contrast, no enhanced transcription was observed in extracts from cells infected with an E1A deletion mutant. Moreover, cells co-transfected with the VA- and E1A-containing plasmids showed markedly higher levels of VA RNA synthesis than did cells transfected with the VA-containing plasmid alone. Although analysis of high ionic strength extracts revealed that the enhancement of pol III transcription persists late in infection, moderate ionic strength extracts indicated that transcription factor IIIC becomes limiting. Chromatographic fractionation and complementation analysis of extracts from mock- and virus-infected cells indicated that the factor(s) responsible for the enhanced activity was localized entirely in the fraction containing transcription factor IIIC."
https://openalex.org/W1520111674,"To define more clearly the interactions between mitochondrial creatine kinase and the adenine nucleotide translocase, the outer membrane of rat heart mitochondria was removed by digitonin, producing an inner membrane-matrix (mitoplast) preparation. This mitoplast fracton was well-coupled and contained a high specific activity of mitochondrial creatine kinase. Outer membrane permeabilization was documented by the loss of adenylate kinase, a soluble intermembrane enzyme, and by direct antibody inhibition of mitochondrial creatine kinase activity. With this preparation, we documented four important aspects of functional coupling. Kinetic studies showed that oxidative phosphorylation decreased the value of the ternary enzyme-substrate complex dissociation constant for MgATP from 140 to 16 microM. Two approaches were used to document the adenine nucleotide translocase specificity for ADP generated by mitochondrial creatine kinase. Exogenous pyruvate kinase (20 IU/ml) could not readily phosphorylate ADP produced by creatine kinase, since added pyruvate kinase did not markedly inhibit creatine + ATP-stimulated respiration. Additionally, when ADP was produced by mitochondrial creatine kinase, the inhibition of the translocase required 2 nmol of atractyloside/mg of mitoplast protein, while only 1 nmol/mg was necessary when exogenous ADP was added. Finally, the mass action ratio of the mitochondrial creatine kinase reaction exceeded the apparent equilibrium constant when ATP was supplied to the creatine kinase reaction by oxidative phosphorylation. Overall, these results are consistent with much data from intact rat heart mitochondria, and suggest that the outer membrane plays a minor role in the compartmentation of adenine nucleotides. Furthermore, since the removal of the outer membrane does not alter the unique coupling between oxidative phosphorylation and mitochondrial creatine kinase, we suggest that this cooperation is the result of protein-protein proximity at the inner membrane surface."
https://openalex.org/W1586659225,"A rise in cytosolic free calcium ([Ca2+]i) is thought to be the principal mediator in vascular smooth muscle contraction. Quantitative changes of [Ca2+]i in response to two vasoconstrictor peptide hormones, angiotensin II and vasopressin, were directly measured in monolayers of adherent cultured rat aortic smooth muscle cells loaded with the fluorescent calcium indicator Quin 2. Angiotensin II induced rapid, concentration-dependent rises in [Ca2+]i from 1.53 +/- 0.27 X 10(-7) (n = 16) up to 1.2 X 10(-6) M, with ED50 of 0.45 X 10(-9) M, an effect which was blocked by the antagonist analogue [Sar1, Ala8]angiotensin II. Vasopressin also elicited transient rises in [Ca2+]i to peak levels of about 8 X 10(-7) M, with ED50 of 1.05 X 10(-9) M, and this response was completely abolished by a vasopressor antagonist. In calcium-free medium, basal [Ca2+]i levels fell to 0.92 +/- 0.24 X 10(-7) M (n = 4), and both hormones were still able to raise [Ca2+]i, although to a lesser extent. Readdition of extracellular calcium following the [Ca2+]i transient induced a second, slower [Ca2+]i rise. In calcium-containing medium, lanthanum ion (2 X 10(-5) M) reduced peptide-evoked [Ca2+]i rises to the values observed in calcium-free medium. Stimulation with each peptide completely desensitized the smooth muscle cells to a subsequent identical challenge, with little crosstachyphylaxis. Potassium ion (50 mM) only minimally affected [Ca2+]i levels. The calcium channel blocker nifedipine (10(-6) M) did not prevent the [Ca2+]i rises induced by angiotensin II, vasopressin, or potassium. These findings indicate that the two physiologically important vasoconstrictor hormones angiotensin II and vasopressin rapidly raise [Ca2+]i in cultured vascular smooth muscle cells, in part by mobilizing calcium from intracellular pools and in part through activation of receptor-operated calcium channels."

https://openalex.org/W1489687040,"Fe(IV)=O resonance Raman stretching vibrations were recently identified by this laboratory for horseradish peroxidase compound II and ferryl myoglobin. In the present report it is shown that Fe(IV)=O stretching frequency for horseradish peroxidase compound II will switch between two values depending on pH, with pKa values corresponding to the previously reported compound II heme-linked ionizations of pKa = 6.9 for isoenzyme A-2 and pKa = 8.5 for isoenzyme C. Similar pH-dependent shifts of the Fe(IV)=O frequency of ferryl myoglobin were not detected above pH 6. The Fe(IV)=O stretching frequencies of compound II of the horseradish peroxidase isoenzymes at pH values above the transition points were at a high value approaching the Fe(IV)=O stretching frequency of ferryl myoglobin. Below the transition points the horseradish peroxidase frequencies were found to be 10 cm-1 lower. Frequencies of the Fe(IV)=O stretching vibrations of horseradish peroxidase compound II for one set of isoenzymes were found to be sensitive to deuterium exchange below the transition point but not above. These results were interpreted to be indicative of an alkaline deprotonation of a distal amino acid group, probably histidine, which is hydrogen bonded to the oxyferryl group below the transition point. Deprotonation of this group at pH values above the pKa disrupts hydrogen bonding, raising the Fe(IV)=O stretching frequency, and is proposed to account for the lowering of compound II reactivity at alkaline pH. The high value of the Fe(IV)=O vibration of compound II above the transition point appears to be identical in frequency to what is believed to be the Fe(IV)=O vibration of compound X."

https://openalex.org/W1596384556,"Thrombospondin is a major platelet glycoprotein which is released from platelets during blood coagulation. We examined the interaction of thrombospondin with polymerizing fibrin. Thrombospondin, purified from human platelets and labeled with 125I, became incorporated into clots formed from both plasma and purified fibrinogen. Plasma clots contained somewhat less thrombospondin than clots formed from equivalent concentrations of fibrinogen. In plasma clots and fibrin clots formed in the presence of factor XIII, thrombospondin was cross-linked in the clot; thrombospondin in the supernatant remained largely monomeric. Cross-linking of thrombospondin by factor XIII, however, only slightly increased the amount of thrombospondin which was incorporated into the clot. In contrast, incorporation of 125I-fibronectin into clots was dependent upon cross-linking. Most of the incorporation of 125I-thrombospondin occurred during fibrin polymerization as judged by parallel studies of the incorporation of 125I-fibrinogen. The amount of thrombospondin incorporated into a clot was directly related to thrombospondin concentration and was only weakly dependent on fibrinogen concentration. Incorporation was not saturated at thrombospondin:fibrin (mol/mol) ratios as high as 2/1. Thrombospondin, however, modified the final structure of fibrin clots in a concentration-dependent manner as monitored by opacity. When tryptic digests of 125I-thrombospondin were studied, the 270-kilodalton core became incorporated into fibrin whereas the 30-kilodalton heparin binding fragment was excluded. These results indicate that thrombospondin specifically co-polymerizes with fibrin during blood coagulation and may be an important modulator of clot structure."
https://openalex.org/W2124479563,"Cells of metazoan organisms produce and react to complex macromolecular microenvironments known as extracellular matrices. Assembly in vitro of native, compositionally nonuniform collagen-fibronectin matrices caused translocation of certain types of cells or polystyrene-latex beads from regions lacking fibronectin into regions containing it. The translocation process was not due to diffusion, convection, or electrostatic distribution effects, but may depend on nonequilibrium phenomena at the interface of contiguous collagen matrices formed in the presence and absence of fibronectin or particles. Extracellular matrix formation alone was sufficient to drive translocation by a biophysical process that may play a role in cellular migration during embryogenesis, as well as in other types of tissue reorganization such as inflammation, wound healing, and tumor invasion."
https://openalex.org/W1529118467,"Human and animal influenza A isolates of the H3 serotype preferentially bind SA alpha 2,6Gal or SA alpha 2,3Gal linkages (where SA represents sialic acid), respectively, on cell-surface sialyloligosaccharides. Previously, we have demonstrated selection of SA alpha 2,3Gal-specific receptor variants of several human viruses which differed from the parent viruses by a single amino acid at residue 226 of the hemagglutinin which is located in the receptor binding pocket (Rogers, G. N., Paulson, J.C., Daniels, R.S., Skehel, J.J., Wilson, I.A., and Wiley, D.C. (1983) Nature 304, 76-78). In this report, the selection in the reverse direction was accomplished starting with a SA alpha 2,3Gal-specific avian virus, A/duck/Ukraine/1/63 (H3N7), yielding SA alpha 2,6Gal-specific variants that exhibit the receptor binding properties characteristic of the human isolates. Selection was again mediated at residue 226 of the hemagglutinin, in this case changing from Gln in the parent virus to Leu in the variants. Although the SA alpha 2,6Gal-specific avian virus variants were stable to passage in MDCK cells, they exhibited dramatic reversion to the SA alpha 2,3Gal-specific phenotype of the parent virus during a single passage in chicken embryos. This was in contrast to the SA alpha 2,6Gal-specific human virus isolates which were stable to passage in both hosts. The reversion of the avian virus variants in eggs provides compelling evidence for host-mediated selection of influenza virus receptor variants."
https://openalex.org/W1479945388,"Critical micelle concentrations (CMCs) of palmitoyl-CoA were determined by surface tension, conductivity, and fluorimetric measurements in a variety of buffers at several pH values and ionic strengths. They ranged from 7 to 250 microM and were frequently an order of magnitude higher than most reported values. The CMCs of stearoyl-CoA and oleoyl-CoA, determined fluorimetrically, were also high and consistent with the expected effects of chain length and unsaturation. The effects of ionic strength and temperature were analyzed to obtain the extent of counterion binding and the thermodynamic parameters of micellization. The values of delta H0, delta G0, and delta S0 obtained in 0.011 M Tris, pH 8.3, are -6 K X J X mol-1, -64 K X J X mol-1, and +193 J X mol-1 X K-1, and the average number of univalent ions bound per molecule in the micelles is 1.4. These values are within the range of those obtained for other univalent and polyvalent detergents. Analyzed by sedimentation and diffusion, the micelles are approximately spherical with an anhydrous mass of 50,000 daltons but with dimensions inconsistent with fully extended molecules. Correlation of the information obtained from the present physical studies with kinetic studies using long-chain fatty acyl-CoAs as enzyme substrates may be helpful for understanding the enzymology of these compounds, and some previously published kinetic studies of membrane-bound and soluble enzymes may bear reinterpretation."

In contrast, two luteinizing hormone surges occurred within a single 24-hour period in hamsters whose activity rhythm had dissociated or ""split"" into two distinct components. These observations indicate that both behavioral and endocrine circadian rhythms are regulated by the same multioscillator system, which seems to be composed of at least two distinct circadian oscillators."
https://openalex.org/W1547338001,"Subcutaneous injection of murine macrophage cell line P388D1 into syngeneic DBA/2 produced tumors, which upon solubilization with 40 mM octyl glucoside contained acetylated low density lipoprotein binding activity. The tumor-derived receptor specifically bound acetylated low density lipoprotein with an affinity of approximately 3 X 10(-8) M but did not bind low density lipoprotein or high density lipoprotein. It was identical in binding specificity, affinity, and Pronase sensitivity to the receptor in intact cells or that obtained from solubilized cultured cell membranes. Partial purification of the receptor was achieved by solubilizing tumors with 1% Triton X-100 followed by chromatography on polyethyleneimine cellulose. After elution with a NaCl gradient in the presence of octyl glucoside and association with liposomes, a 287-fold purification of the receptor was achieved. The receptor was identified by specific ligand blotting as a 260,000-dalton protein having a pI of approximately 6.0. Binding to the receptor by acetylated low density lipoprotein, malondialdehyde-modified low density lipoprotein, and maleic anhydride-modified serum albumin was demonstrated by ligand blotting. A single receptor protein can, therefore, account for the binding of multiple types of charge-modified lipoprotein and nonlipoprotein ligands to the macrophage cell surface."
https://openalex.org/W1504757923,"Abstract Many human carcinomas accumulate a large quantity of glycolipids having X (Gal beta 1----4[Fuc alpha 1----3] GlcNAc) as well as di- or trimeric X determinant (Gal beta 1----4 [Fuc alpha 1----3] GlcNAc beta 1----3Gal beta 1----4 [Fuc alpha 1----3]GlcNAc beta 1----3Gal) (e.g. Hakomori, S., Nudelman, E., Levery, S. B., and Kannagi, R. (1984) J. Biol. Chem. 259, 4672-4680). The enzymatic basis of this phenomenon has been investigated with human small cell lung carcinoma NCI-H69 cells, in which a series of these structures has been found to accumulate. An alpha 1----3 fucosyltransferase solubilized from the membrane fraction with Triton X-100 catalyzed not only the transfer of a fucosyl residue from GDP-fucose to the penultimate GlcNAc residue of lactoneotetraosylceramide (nLc4) and lactonorhexaosylceramide (nLc6), but also to the internal GlcNAc residue (III-GlcNAc) of y2 glycolipid (V3FucnLc6) and that of sialosyl2----6lactonorhexaosylceramide (VI6NeuAcnLc6). No transfer of fucose to the internal GlcNAc (III-GlcNAc) of lactonorhexaosylceramide occurred, unless the above substitutions (V3Fuc or VI6NeuAc) were present. Fucosylation at V-GlcNAc and III-GlcNAc of nLc6 could be catalyzed by the same enzyme, based on the following observations: (i) fucosylation at both III- and V-GlcNAc was competitively inhibited by V3FucnLc6 and III3V3Fuc2nLc6; (ii) the same conditions (pH, bivalent cation, detergent) were optimal for fucosylation at both III- and V-GlcNAc; (iii) the Km values of the enzyme for nLc4, nLc6, and V3FucnLc6 were approximately the same; and (iv) the activity of the enzyme catalyzing fucosylation at both III- and V-GlcNAc was adsorbed on GDP-hexanolamine-Sepharose and was not inhibited by N-ethylmaleimide. The enzyme preferentially transferred fucose to the penultimate VGlcNAc, followed by transfer to the internal III-GlcNAc of nLc6. Thus, the pathway for synthesis of dimeric X proceeds as follows: nLc6----V3FucnLc6----III3V3Fuc2nLc6. No mechanism was found to operate for chain elongation of the X hapten structure through addition of GlcNAc residues to the terminal Gal of the X hapten."

https://openalex.org/W1548972860,"Despite the growing evidence implicating proteoglycans in the control of cell proliferation and differentiation, little is known about the factors that control their metabolism in neoplasia or the mechanisms through which these macromolecules may influence neoplastic growth. The primary objective of the present study was to test whether human colon carcinoma cells released soluble mediators capable of stimulating the synthesis of proteoglycans in normal colon fibroblasts in vitro. Serum-free medium conditioned by colon carcinoma cells (TCM) was capable of stimulating several-fold the synthesis and secretion of proteoglycans in normal colon fibroblasts without inducing a mitogenic response. This effect was a true stimulation of proteoglycan biosynthesis since the kinetics of turnover were identical in the presence or absence of TCM. Characterization of the proteoglycans synthesized in the absence of TCM revealed that colon fibroblasts synthesized at least three species of proteoglycans including a heparan sulfate proteoglycan which was associated primarily with the cell layer and two populations of proteoglycans which were predominantly released into the medium and contained chondroitin-dermatan sulfate side chains. When fibroblasts were exposed to TCM, they synthesized and released higher amounts of proteoglycans which had overall similar density, molecular weight, and polydispersity but differed from controls in that they contained significantly higher proportions of chondroitin sulfate side chains. Partial characterization of TCM strongly indicated that the stimulatory activity comprised a family of polypeptides, with molecular weight between 5.4 and 6.0 X 10(5), which were heat stable and acid/alkali labile. Neoplastic modulation of proteoglycan metabolism in normal mesenchymal cells may represent an additional mechanism through which tumor cells can alter their surrounding environment."

https://openalex.org/W1500048896,"During endocytosis, mannosylated ligands enter vesicles which have a density intermediate between that of the plasma membrane and secondary lysosomes. Mannosylated ligands are transferred from these vesicles to lysosomes. A solubilization-precipitation assay was used to study the dissociation of mannosylated ligands from their receptor. In whole cells dissociation was rapid (t 1/2 (37 degrees C) = 8 min) and took place before delivery of the ligand to lysosomes. Receptor-ligand dissociation within membrane vesicles, washed free of cytosol, could be induced by addition of ATP and GTP but not ADP. Receptor-ligand dissociation caused by manipulating the pH of the vesicles suggested that the pH within endosomes was lowered to 5.5 by addition of ATP. Dissociation was blocked by proton ionophores and Zn2+, but was unaffected by inhibitors of the F1, Fo-ATPase or the Na+,K+-ATPase. Dissociation did not require Na+ or K+ and was blocked by anion transport inhibitors. Dissociation was slowed in the absence of permeant anions (Cl-). Receptor-ligand complexes within vesicles isolated as early as 2 min following ligand internalization responded to addition of ATP. The results suggest that receptor-ligand dissociation in endosomes requires ATP, possibly to power endosomal acidification via an ATP-dependent proton pump. Dissociation is enhanced in the presence of permeant anions, suggesting the involvement of an anion channel or carrier."

The results of phosphorus-31 nuclear magnetic resonance (31P NMR) monitoring of conscious animals in vivo showed rapid phosphorylation of 2-deoxyglucose by brain tissue. The rate of phosphorylation as determined by 31P NMR was consistent with results achieved by tracer methods using carbon-14-labeled 2-deoxyglucose. However, the disappearance of 2-deoxyglucose-6-phosphate was shown to be faster than that reported by tracer studies and occurred without alterations of intracellular pH and energy homeostasis. These results were confirmed by gas chromatography and mass spectroscopy. It is postulated that 2-deoxyglucose may be metabolized in several ways, including dephosphorylation by a hexose phosphatase."
https://openalex.org/W1509214953,"31P NMR studies of intact cells and perchloric acid extracts are used to investigate the effect of ethanol on the bioenergetics and glycolysis of Clostridium thermocellum, an anaerobic bacterium potentially useful for the single step conversion of biomass to ethanol. Whole cells suspended in phosphate buffer and given a carbon source (cellobiose) at 60 degrees C rapidly establish a pH gradient across the membrane that can be monitored by the chemical shifts of inorganic phosphate in the exterior buffer and in the cytoplasm. Peak intensities can be related to phosphate active transport rates. Wild type bacteria and cells grown in inhibiting concentrations of ethanol establish similar pH gradients, but with slower kinetics and slower phosphate transport rates for the cells adapted to growth in ethanol. Direct addition of ethanol does not affect the rate of pH gradient formation or phosphate transport. Thus, while ethanol does not directly affect processes for energy conservation carried out by the membrane, adaptation to ethanol does alter membrane functions such as phosphate transport. 31P NMR spectra of perchloric acid extracts show that when wild type cells are adapted to grow in inhibiting concentrations of ethanol and then energized with cellobiose, sugar phosphate content is increased and the steady state distribution of glycolytic intermediates is altered. Nucleotide triphosphate/nucleotide diphosphate ratios are unaltered in these cells. These results strongly indicate that in C. thermocellum growth inhibition by ethanol is related to a blockage in glycolysis."

https://openalex.org/W1527634434,"The effects of several short-chain mercapto acids on the rate of respiration supported by either palmitoylcarnitine, octanoate, or pyruvate was studied with coupled rat heart mitochondria. 3-Mercaptopropionic acid was found to be a potent inhibitor of respiration sustained by palmitoylcarnitine or octanoate, whereas under identical conditions respiration with pyruvate as a substrate was unaffected. 2-Mercaptoacetic acid also inhibits palmitoylcarnitine-supported respiration, but only at much higher concentrations of the inhibitor. 2-Mercaptopropionic acid has virtually no effect. Incubation of mitochondria with 3-mercaptopropionic acid did not cause the irreversible inactivation of any beta-oxidation enzyme. Since 3-mercaptopropionic acid did not inhibit beta-oxidation in uncoupled mitochondria, it appears that this compound must first be metabolized in an energy-dependent reaction before it becomes inhibitory. 3-Mercaptopropionyl-CoA and three of its S-acyl derivatives, all of which are likely mitochondrial metabolites of 3-mercaptopropionic acid, were tested for their capacity to inhibit the individual enzymes of beta-oxidation. 3-Mercaptopropionyl-CoA inhibits only acyl-CoA dehydrogenase, whereas S-myristoyl-3-mercaptopropionyl-CoA inhibits reversibly several beta-oxidation enzymes. All observations together lead us to suggest that the inhibition of beta-oxidation by 3-mercaptopropionic acid in coupled rat heart mitochondria is most likely a consequence of the reversible inhibition of acyl-CoA dehydrogenase by long-chain S-acyl-3-mercaptopropionyl-CoA thioesters and possibly by 3-mercaptopropionyl-CoA."

A crude ganglioside fraction was prepared from Cad cells and found to inhibit the hemagglutination reaction, whereas neutral glycolipids were inactive. Further analysis of the ganglioside extract from Cad erythrocytes by thin layer chromatography revealed an unusual profile characterized by a lower content of sialosylparagloboside and the presence of a novel ganglioside of slower mobility. Immunochemical studies demonstrate that this ganglioside binds Helix pomatia lectin and inhibits human anti-Sda antibody. In addition, a ganglioside with identical chromatographic mobility can be obtained by the enzymatic transfer of GalNAc from UDP-GalNAc to sialosylparagloboside using a microsomal preparation from human kidney. These results together with cell surface labeling experiments suggest that the major ganglioside of Cad erythrocytes might be derived from sialosylparagloboside by substitution with an additional N-acetylgalactosamine residue."
https://openalex.org/W1544925648,"Epididymal 5 alpha-reductase converts testosterone to 5 alpha-dihydrotestosterone. The enzyme is localized to the nuclear and microsomal membranes, and using two approaches, we investigated the relationship between 5 alpha-reductase activity and the membrane environment. In the first, nuclear and microsomal membrane fractions were treated with phospholipases to modify specifically the structure of the phospholipid component of the membranes, and the effects of these treatments on the kinetic parameters of 5 alpha-reductase were examined. The second approach was to observe the effects of phospholipids of known structure on solubilized 5 alpha-reductase activity. Treatment of the membrane fractions with phospholipase C increased the Km(app) of both the nuclear and microsomal 5 alpha-reductases for testosterone. Phospholipase A2 treatment also increased the Km(app) of the microsomal enzyme, but in contrast, the Km(app) of the nuclear 5 alpha-reductase for testosterone was unaffected. This demonstrated a fundamental difference in the role of the membrane environment in the expression of 5 alpha-reductase activity in these subcellular compartments. The ability of phospholipids to enhance the activity of solubilized 5 alpha-reductase was highly specific and structure related. Only phosphatidylcholines containing either unsaturated acyl chains or saturated acyl chains of 12 carbon atoms were found to activate 5 alpha-reductase. The most potent activator was dilauroyl phosphatidylcholine, which reduced the Km(app) values of both nuclear and microsomal 5 alpha-reductases for testosterone, without affecting the concentration of active 5 alpha-reductase (Vmax(app) ). This is the first time that an activator of 5 alpha-reductase has been found. These findings suggest that epididymal 5 alpha-reductase activity may be regulated by changes in the phospholipid environment."
https://openalex.org/W200511621,"In low ionic media, mitochondrial glycerophosphate acyltransferase was inhibited virtually completely within 15 min by the nonspecific proteases, proteinase K and subtilisin. In high ionic media, the mitochondrial enzyme was either not inhibited or was marginally inhibited by these proteases. Chymotrypsin and trypsin, regardless of the ionic strength of the medium, did not inhibit the acyltransferase. Substantial inhibition by proteinase K and subtilisin was observed in the high ionic media when the incubation was continued for 30 or 45 min. Adenylate kinase, an intermembrane enzyme, was not inhibited under any of the above conditions. These results demonstrate a cytosolic exposure of the mitochondrial acyltransferase. In a low ionic environment, when the outer membrane integrity was damaged either by gradually decreasing the tonicity of the medium or by stepwise addition of Triton X-100, either chymotrypsin or trypsin caused virtually parallel inhibition of glycerophosphate acyltransferase and adenylate kinase. A more direct approach in establishing the existence of protease-susceptible sites on the inner side of the outer membrane was taken by observing the inhibition of mitochondrial glycerophosphate acyltransferase and adenylate kinase in trypsinloaded right-side-out outer membrane vesicles incubated in the presence of externally located soybean trypsin inhibitor. The above results, taken together, suggest that mitochondrial glycerophosphate acyltransferase spans the transverse plane of the outer membrane."
https://openalex.org/W2028411163,"Measles virus generally produces acute illness. Rarely, however, persistent infection of brain cells occurs, resulting in a chronic and fatal neurological disease, subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE). Evidence indicates that expression of the measles virus matrix protein is selectively restricted in this persistent infection, but the mechanism underlying this restriction has not been identified. Defective translation of matrix messenger RNA has been described in one SSPE cell line. This report presents evidence that in a different SSPE tissue culture cell line IP-3-Ca, the matrix protein is synthesized but fails to accumulate. A general scheme is proposed to reconcile the different levels at which restriction of matrix protein has been observed."
https://openalex.org/W1485629671,"Both mammalian nonmuscle and muscle actins possess an AcAsp(Glu)NH2 terminus. The nonmuscle actin genes code for a polypeptide with a Met-Asp NH2 terminus (class I) whereas the muscle actin genes code for a polypeptide with a Met-Cys-Asp NH2 terminus (class II). Two amino acids must be removed for mature muscle actin synthesis, whereas only the Met must be removed for nonmuscle actin synthesis. We wished to know whether a nonmuscle cell which normally does not synthesize a class I actin can correctly process a muscle actin with its extra NH2-terminal amino acid in vivo. To answer this question we have used L/LK165 cells, a mouse L-cell transfected with a human cardiac muscle actin gene. When these cells were labeled overnight with [35S]Cys, an actin with an NH2-terminal tryptic peptide corresponding to that of mature cardiac muscle actin was detected. When the cells were pulse-labeled for 20 min, a new actin intermediate containing an AcCys-Asp amino terminus was observed which then disappeared with time. Furthermore, the muscle actin was processed as fast if not faster than the nonmuscle actin in these cells. This actin intermediate was also seen in chick myotube cultures. Our results show that the ability to correctly process muscle specific actins is not tissue specific. Furthermore, these results confirm a processing pathway for class II actins proposed by us earlier on the basis of experiments with a cell-free translation system."
https://openalex.org/W1598339368,"Phosphocreatinine undergoes the following spontaneous simultaneous reactions at pH 7.4 (0.02 M sodium phosphate and 120 mM KCl) and 38 degrees C. (Formula: see text) The first order rate constants are 0.046 h-1 (ka) and 0.048 h-1 (kb). There is a major effect of pH on the reactions such that at pH values higher than 7.4 phosphocreatine production predominates, while at pH values less than 7.4 creatinine is the major product. This along with titration data showing apparent pK values of about 3.0 and 7.5 for phosphocreatinine suggest that the dianionic form of phosphocreatinine is involved in the conversion to phosphocreatine, whereas the monoanionic form is exclusively converted to creatinine. Possible mechanisms to account for the reactivity of phosphocreatinine are discussed. Several lines of evidence suggest that the apparent Keq for phosphocreatine formation from phosphocreatinine is about 300 at pH 9.0 and about 70 at pH 7.0, and the delta G0‘ (pH 7.0) is-2.6 kcal/mol. The delta G0‘ (pH 7.0) for the hydrolysis of the phosphoryl bond in phosphocreatinine is-12.8 kcal/mol. The phosphocreatinine content of rabbit white skeletal muscle was measured to be 0.05 mumol/g, which is 0.4% of the phosphocreatine content. The in vitro experiments suggest that phosphohydrolysis of phosphocreatinine can account for a creatinine formation equal to 0.5% of the phosphocreatine content/day. We conclude that it is likely that a substantial fraction of the in vivo creatinine production from phosphocreatine goes through the novel high energy phosphate, phosphocreatinine, as an intermediate."
https://openalex.org/W1657006070,"Both cytosolic and mitochondrial aspartate transaminase can be resolved of pyridoxal phosphate. The resulting apoenzymes still bind individual structural components of the coenzyme. The separate contributions of coenzyme components to protein thermal stability have been independently assessed for phosphate ions (Pi) and for the pyridoxal or pyridoxamine components of the coenzyme. 31P NMR and differential scanning calorimetry reveal that the thermodynamic contributions of binding are not additive and are dissimilar for the two isozymes. High and low affinity sites for Pi binding are present in both apoenzymes with only the low affinity site being present in the holoenzyme forms. The contribution of both bound phosphates to increasing temperatures (Tm) and enthalpies (delta Hd) of denaturation differ between the isozymes and within sites. In either isozyme occupancy of the high affinity site by Pi produces only a 4- or 5- degree increase in the Tm value with respect to Pi-free apoenzyme. By contrast, in the mitochondrial apoenzyme, the presence of Pi at the second low affinity site increases the calorimetric parameters from Tm = 47 degrees C and delta Hd = 4.7 cal g-1 to Tm = 62 degrees C and delta Hd = 7 cal g-1. For cytosolic apoenzyme the respective changes are from 66 to 69.5 degrees C and 5.2 to 5.8 cal g-1. Addition of pyridoxal, but not pyridoxamine, displaces the high affinity Pi in both apoenzymes. This shows that the pyridine ring and Pi groups of pyridoxal-P bind exclusive of each other when they are not covalently linked as an ester, as in the coenzyme. The observation has been exploited as a method to prepare completely dephosphorylated mitochondrial apoenzyme. Electrostatic effects, structural differences in the phosphate binding pockets, and steric effects can be invoked to account for the Pi and pyridine binding behavior in the two proteins."
