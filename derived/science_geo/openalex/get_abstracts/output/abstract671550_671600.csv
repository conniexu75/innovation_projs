Causes are ill defined but could be through direct cardiac infection and/or inflammation-induced dysfunction. To identify mechanisms and cardio-protective drugs, we use a state-of-the-art pipeline combining human cardiac organoids with phosphoproteomics and single nuclei RNA sequencing. We identify an inflammatory “cytokine-storm”, a cocktail of interferon gamma, interleukin 1β, and poly(I:C), induced diastolic dysfunction. Bromodomain-containing protein 4 is activated along with a viral response that is consistent in both human cardiac organoids (hCOs) and hearts of SARS-CoV-2-infected K18-hACE2 mice. Bromodomain and extraterminal family inhibitors (BETi) recover dysfunction in hCOs and completely prevent cardiac dysfunction and death in a mouse cytokine-storm model. Additionally, BETi decreases transcription of genes in the viral response, decreases ACE2 expression, and reduces SARS-CoV-2 infection of cardiomyocytes. Together, BETi, including the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) breakthrough designated drug, apabetalone, are promising candidates to prevent COVID-19 mediated cardiac damage."
https://openalex.org/W3119441281,"The concept of liquid–liquid phase separation (LLPS) has emerged as an intriguing mechanism for the organization of membraneless compartments in cells. The alcohol 1,6-hexanediol is widely used as a control to dissolve LLPS assemblies in phase separation studies in diverse fields. However, little is known about potential side effects of 1,6-hexanediol, which could compromise data interpretation and mislead the scientific debate. To examine this issue, we analyzed the effect of 1,6-hexanediol on the activities of various enzymes in vitro. Already at 1% volume concentration, 1,6-hexanediol strongly impaired kinases and phosphatases and partly blocked DNA polymerases, while it had no effect on DNase activity. At concentrations that are usually used to dissolve LLPS droplets (5–10%), both kinases and phosphatases were virtually inactive. Given the widespread function of protein phosphorylation in cells, our data argue for a careful review of 1,6-hexanediol in phase separation studies.

Different nuclear assemblies (the nucleolus, nuclear speckles, Cajal bodies, and the nuclear pore), as well as cytoplasmic structures (P-bodies, stress granules, and the centriole) form without defining membranes by the condensation of proteins, nucleic acids, and other biomolecular components (6Boeynaems S.

A recent study indicates that even drug pharmacodynamics of small-molecular cancer therapeutics are altered by the concentration of compounds in specific protein condensates independent of their drug targets, resulting in a change of drug activity (17Klein I.A. Boija A. Afeyan L.K. Hawken S.W. Fan M. Dall'Agnese A. Oksuz O. Henninger J.E. Shrinivas K. Sabari B.R. Sagi I. Clark V.E. Platt J.M. Kar M. McCall P.M. et al.Partitioning of cancer therapeutics in nuclear condensates.Science. 2020; 368: 1386-1392Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). These results implicate that a better understanding of LLPS might lead to substantial advantages in the future development of efficacious therapeutics in many diseases. A hallmark of many proteins, which are prone to participate in LLPS assemblies, is the presence of intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs). These regions are enriched in repetitive sequences of a few amino acids, usually resulting in characteristic domains of low complexity (18Uversky V.N. Intrinsically disordered proteins in overcrowded milieu: membrane-less organelles, phase separation, and intrinsic disorder.Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2017; 44: 18-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar, 19Martin E.W. Mittag T. Relationship of sequence and phase separation in protein low-complexity regions.Biochemistry. 2018; 57: 2478-2487Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). A growing number of studies identified and characterized IDRs of various LLPS participating proteins in vitro and in cells, demonstrating that IDRs play a crucial role in liquid droplet formation of these proteins under certain conditions. Previous studies observed the formation of such condensates also for the C-terminal domain (CTD) of human RNA polymerase II (pol II) and other proteins involved in transcriptional control (20Sabari B.R. Dall'Agnese A. Boija A. Klein I.A. Coffey E.L. Shrinivas K. Abraham B.J. Hannett N.M. Zamudio A.V. Manteiga J.C. Li C.H. Guo Y.E. Day D.S. Schuijers J.

Rankovic M. Hansen A.S. Yu T. Marie-Nelly H. McSwiggen D.T. Kokic G. Dailey G.M. Cramer P. Darzacq X. Zweckstetter M. RNA polymerase II clustering through carboxy-terminal domain phase separation.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2018; 25: 833-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). The human RNA pol II CTD is composed of 52 hepta-peptide repeats with a YSPTSPS consensus sequence, provoking a structure of low complexity and a plethora of amino acids, which can be targeted by posttranslational modifications (22Eick D. Geyer M. The RNA polymerase II carboxy-terminal domain (CTD) code.Chem. Rev. 2013; 113: 8456-8490Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). During transcription, the pol II CTD is phosphorylated in a specific manner upon the transitions from initiation to elongation, RNA procession, polyadenylation, and termination. Whereas the hypo-phosphorylated pol II CTD is incorporated into Mediator condensates during transcription initiation, this incorporation is reduced upon phosphorylation by the TFIIH kinase Cdk7 and the hyperphosphorylated pol II CTD is subsequently incorporated into condensates that are formed by splicing factors (23Guo Y.E. Manteiga J.C. Henninger J.E. Sabari B.R. Dall'Agnese A. Hannett N.M. Spille J.-H. Afeyan L.K. Zamudio A.V. Shrinivas K. Abraham B.J. Boija A. Decker T.-M. Rimel J.K. Fant C.B. et al.Pol II phosphorylation regulates a switch between transcriptional and splicing condensates.Nature. 2019; 572: 543-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Thus, pol II CTD phosphorylation might be a persuasive mechanism that is suggested to regulate the condensate preferences of RNA pol II during transcription. The stability of such pol II CTD condensates was shown to decrease upon truncation to 25 hepta-repeats, whereas extension to 70 hepta-repeats had the opposite effect (21Boehning M. Dugast-Darzacq C. Rankovic M. Hansen A.S. Yu T. Marie-Nelly H. McSwiggen D.T. Kokic G. Dailey G.M. Cramer P. Darzacq X. Zweckstetter M. RNA polymerase II clustering through carboxy-terminal domain phase separation.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2018; 25: 833-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Likewise, P-TEFb and DYRK1A, two key players in transcriptional regulation and well-studied pol II CTD kinases, have recently been shown to participate in liquid-like droplets via a histidine-rich domain of low complexity (24Lu H. Yu D. Hansen A.S. Ganguly S. Liu R. Heckert A. Darzacq X. Zhou Q. Phase-separation mechanism for C-terminal hyperphosphorylation of RNA polymerase II.Nature. 2018; 558: 318-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). The aliphatic alcohol 1,6-hexanediol interferes with weak hydrophobic interactions and is often used to dissolve protein condensates in vitro and in cells, illustrating the reversible character of phase separations (25Elbaum-Garfinkle S. Matter over mind: liquid phase separation and neurodegeneration.J. Biol. Chem. 2019; 294: 7160-7168Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 26Alberti S. Gladfelter A. Mittag T. Considerations and challenges in studying liquid-liquid phase separation and biomolecular condensates.Cell. 2019; 176: 419-434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar). The first report of an aliphatic dialcohol used to disturb membraneless subcellular structures was a study on nuclear pore complexes where 1,2-hexanediol and the cyclic variant cyclohexane-1,2-diol were capable to perturb the permeability barrier of the nuclear pore, whereas the less hydrophobic 1,2,3-hexanetriol had no effect (27Ribbeck K. Görlich D. The permeability barrier of nuclear pore complexes appears to operate via hydrophobic exclusion.EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2664-2671Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). Another study on nuclear transport mechanisms tested different alcohols and introduced 1,6-hexanediol as a potent agent to induce permeability of the nuclear pore and showed that the potency of the alcohol to dissolve condensates is correlated to its hydrophobicity (28Shulga N. Goldfarb D.S. Binding dynamics of structural nucleoporins govern nuclear pore complex permeability and may mediate channel gating.Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 23: 534-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Since then, the vulnerability of condensates to 1,6-hexanediol treatment is often used to delineate that droplet structures are caused by phase separation. However, LLPS is driven by different types of interactions including electrostatic, hydrophobic, pi–pi, and pi–cation interactions (15Qamar S. Wang G. Randle S.J. Ruggeri F.S. Varela J.A. Lin J.Q.

It is not yet fully understood how 1,6-hexanediol disrupts these assemblies and several protein condensates are indeed resistant to 1,6-hexanediol treatment in vitro (8Boeynaems S. Bogaert E.

Chem. 2019; 294: 7160-7168Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Moreover, 1,6-hexanediol treatment of yeast and human cells revealed hexanediol resistant spots in cells as well as the appearance of such structures upon treatment (30McSwiggen D.T. Mir M.

Evaluating phase separation in live cells: diagnosis, caveats, and functional consequences.Genes Dev. 2019; 33: 1619-1634Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 31Kroschwald S. Maharana S. Alberti S. Hexanediol: a chemical probe to investigate the material properties of membrane-less compartments.Matters. 2017; https://doi.org/10.19185/matters.201702000010Crossref Google Scholar). Albeit tolerated at concentrations of up to 10% for short times, prolonged incubation with 1,6-hexanediol results in cell death (3Wheeler J.R. Matheny T. Jain S. Abrisch R. Parker R. Distinct stages in stress granule assembly and disassembly.eLife. 2016; 5e18413Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar, 31Kroschwald S. Maharana S. Alberti S. Hexanediol: a chemical probe to investigate the material properties of membrane-less compartments.Matters. 2017; https://doi.org/10.19185/matters.201702000010Crossref Google Scholar). Besides affecting the nuclear pore complex, hexanediol has been shown to dissolve intermediate filaments, which could contribute to the cellular phenotypes of the chemical (32Lin Y. Mori E. Kato M. Xiang S. Wu L. Kwon I. McKnight S.L. Toxic PR poly-dipeptides encoded by the C9orf72 repeat expansion target LC domain polymers.Cell. 2016; 167: 789-802Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Notably, 1,6-hexanediol has been suggested as a specific inhibitor of lactate dehydrogenase isoenzyme 1 already in the late 80s of the last century (33Tanishima K. Ohta E. Mikami J. Sumita S. Selective determination of lactate dehydrogenase isoenzyme 1 in serum after inhibition by 1,6-hexanediol.J. Clin. Chem. Clin. Biochem. 1987; 25: 729-732PubMed Google Scholar, 34Shamberger R.J. Lactate dehydrogenase isoenzyme 1 as determined by inhibition with 1,6-hexanediol and by two other methods in patients with myocardial infarction or cardiac-bypass surgery.Clin. Chem. 1987; 33: 589-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). The capacity of 1,6-hexanediol as a marker to distinguish LLPS from other assemblies is therefore limited, in particular in cellular systems in which the experimental conditions cannot be controlled adequately. In addition to the mentioned caveats of 1,6-hexanediol, direct effects of the dialcohol on protein function and integrity besides its ability to dissolve condensates have not been systematically addressed (26Alberti S. Gladfelter A. Mittag T. Considerations and challenges in studying liquid-liquid phase separation and biomolecular condensates.Cell. 2019; 176: 419-434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar, 30McSwiggen D.T. Mir M. Darzacq X. Tjian R. Evaluating phase separation in live cells: diagnosis, caveats, and functional consequences.Genes Dev. 2019; 33: 1619-1634Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). In this study, we investigated the effect of 1,6-hexanediol on the enzymatic activities of kinases and phosphatases in in vitro assays. Our data suggest that 1,6-hexanediol impairs kinase activity kinome-wide independently of LLPS. Hexanediol is therefore not a suitable tool to study the functional relationship between phase separation and cellular pathways that involve phosphorylation. We conclude that studies using 1,6-hexanediol should be very carefully interpreted with regard to mechanistic reasoning from experiments using this agent. We started the analysis of 1,6-hexanediol on kinase activity with the cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk) complex Cdk9/CycT1, which acts as the positive transcription elongation factor b (P-TEFb) by phosphorylating the RNA pol II CTD and other regulators of transcriptional elongation. P-TEFb has been found to form condensates due to an intrinsically disordered region within the CycT1 subunit (Fig. 1A). Furthermore, LLPS formation has been suggested to facilitate Cdk9 activity since 1,6-hexanediol treatment greatly diminished P-TEFb activity in vitro (24Lu H. Yu D. Hansen A.S. Ganguly S. Liu R. Heckert A. Darzacq X. Zhou Q. Phase-separation mechanism for C-terminal hyperphosphorylation of RNA polymerase II.Nature. 2018; 558: 318-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). To analyze the impact of 1,6-hexanediol, we purified full-length P-TEFb from Sf9 cells and determined its ability to phosphorylate the C-terminal domain (CTD) of the human RNA pol II subunit Rpb1 in the absence and presence of the dialcohol. We additionally used a truncated P-TEFb variant (P-TEFb ΔIDR), which lacks the disordered C-terminal region of CycT1 and is thus unable to form condensates (24Lu H. Yu D. Hansen A.S. Ganguly S. Liu R. Heckert A. Darzacq X. Zhou Q. Phase-separation mechanism for C-terminal hyperphosphorylation of RNA polymerase II.Nature. 2018; 558: 318-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Addition of 1,6-hexanediol results in a concentration-dependent decrease in kinase activity in both full-length P-TEFb and the truncated P-TEFb ΔIDR (Fig. 1B). Kinase activity was already diminished by 25% at a 1,6-hexanediol concentration of 0.625% (v/v). At a concentration of 5% 1,6-hexanediol, the kinase activity was reduced to 5%. Importantly, the effect was independent of the CycT1 disordered region suggesting that impaired kinase activity by 1,6-hexanediol is not related to LLPS. To further investigate the effect of 1,6-hexanediol on kinases, we expanded our in vitro analysis to the human transcription kinases Cdk7/CycH, Cdk12/CycK, and DYRK1A (Fig. 1C). In this context, we only used well-described, structured regions of the proteins, which have not been implicated to form condensates in vitro. Moreover, kinases were used at a concentration of 0.1 μM and without any crowding agents, which makes it unlikely that they phase-separated in the tube. All three kinases were similarly affected by the use of 1,6-hexanediol as observed before for P-TEFb, demonstrating that 1,6-hexanediol impairs kinase activity independently of their capability for LLPS. To overcome a technical bias due to the use of recombinant proteins, we further analyzed native kinases and substrates from HeLa full cell lysate. To monitor kinase activity in the samples and to discriminate in vitro phosphorylation from already phosphorylated proteins, we used ATPγS in combination with a specific antibody, which detects the thio-phosphorylation after alkylation with p-nitrobenzyl mesylate (35Allen J.J. Li M. Brinkworth C.S. Paulson J.L. Wang D. Hübner A. Chou W.-H. Davis R.J. Burlingame A.L. Messing R.O. Katayama C.D. Hedrick S.M. Shokat K.M. A semisynthetic epitope for kinase substrates.Nat. Methods. 2007; 4: 511-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). After cell lysis, we added MgCl2 and either ATP or ATPγS and incubated the samples for 1 h at 25 °C in the absence or presence of 5% 1,6-hexanediol. Equal loading of the samples was confirmed by ponceau staining (Fig. 1D). Western blot analysis showed no signal after incubation of HeLa lysate with ATP, assuring the specificity of the antibody for thio-phosphorylated proteins. Incubation with ATPγS led to pronounced band patterns showing efficient use of ATPγS by the native kinases. Consistent with our data obtained from recombinant proteins, the addition of 5% 1,6-hexanediol greatly diminished kinase activity within the HeLa cell lysate suggesting a general, kinome-wide effect of 1,6-hexanediol on kinase activity. We next wondered whether the effect of 1,6-hexanediol on kinase activity reduction in vitro is reversible. Therefore, we preincubated 1 μM recombinant kinases P-TEFb, Cdk7/CycH, or DYRK1A with 5% 1,6-hexanediol for 30 min at room temperature. These samples were then diluted tenfold to 0.5% 1,6-hexanediol by addition of kinase assay buffer. For comparison, fresh kinase samples at 0.1 μM concentration without or with 0.5% 1,6-hexanediol were prepared. As expected, addition of 5% 1,6-hexanediol significantly diminishes the activity of all three kinases (Fig. 1E). However, upon dilution of these samples from 5% to 0.5% 1,6-hexanediol, the kinases regained activity to the same levels as freshly prepared kinases with 0.5% 1,6-hexanediol. We therefore conclude that the alcohol 1,6-hexanediol does not irreversibly impair the kinase activity but can be washed out upon dilution from higher concentrates to restore the protein’s enzymatic activity. In cells, the function of kinases on substrate phosphorylation is counteracted by phosphatases. The strong effect of 1,6-hexanediol towards kinase activity prompted us to investigate if phosphatases are similarly affected. We expressed and purified the RNA pol II CTD specific phosphatase SSU72 from E.coli and determined its ability to dephosphorylate P-TEFb phosphorylated GST-CTD composed of nine consensus pol II CTD repeats (GST-CTD[9]) by SDS-PAGE and quantitative radiometric assays (Fig. 2, A and B). The GST-CTD[9] substrate was phosphorylated with 0.2 μM P-TEFb for 1 h at 30 °C resulting in a complete shift of the GST-CTD substrate in SDS-PAGE analysis indicating full phosphorylation of the substrate. P-TEFb activity was then quenched by addition of the kinase inhibitor Flavopiridol to a final concentration of 1 μM. Incubation of phosphorylated GST-CTD[9] (GST-pCTD[9]) with the phosphatase SSU72 led to a continuous dephosphorylation of GST-CTD[9] (Fig. 2A). However, in the presence of 5% 1,6-hexanediol, phosphatase activity was nearly absent and only visible after 22 h of incubation (Fig. 2A). For quantification we repeated the assay with isotope-labeled [32P]-γ-ATP and subsequent detection by liquid scintillation counting (Fig. 2B). Consistent with SDS-PAGE analysis, incubation of phosphorylated GST-CTD[9] with the phosphatase SSU72 resulted in a constant decrease in phosphorylation levels. In the presence of 5% 1,6-hexanediol, dephosphorylation was reduced and only detectable after 22 h of incubation. We wondered if other enzymatic activities are similarly affected by 1,6-hexanediol and chose DNA digestion by DNase I and amplification by DNA polymerases as complementary systems to the kinase and phosphatase assays. Linearized plasmid DNA was digested with DNase I in the absence or presence of 5% 1,6-hexanediol over a time course of 60 min (Fig. 2C). Without 1,6-hexanediol treatment, the plasmid DNA was digested almost completely after 60 min. However, in contrast to the observed effects on kinases and phosphatases activity, the ability of DNase I to digest plasmid DNA was not significantly affected by the presence of 5% 1,6-hexanediol as the DNA was similarly degraded over the time course experiment. The effect of 1,6-hexanediol on DNA amplification activities using polymerases Q5 and OneTaq in a PCR assay instead varied. Whereas the Q5 high-fidelity polymerase using a DNA template with high GC content was only significantly reduced at 5% hexanediol concentration and fully impaired at 10%, the OneTaq polymerase appeared more susceptible to 1,6-hexanediol showing a reduced activity already at the lowest concentration applied (Fig. 2D). Here, the PCR activity was already diminished at 0.625% and fully lost at 2.5% of the dialcohol. The data nicely confirm that each enzyme reacts differently on the chemical and that the activity should be determined individually when interpreting dissolution experiments. We reasoned that the effect of 1,6-hexanediol is due to changes in the three-dimensional protein structure or its potential surface coverage. We used the nano differential scanning fluorimetry (nanoDSF) technique to determine how 1,6-hexanediol affects the thermal denaturation of the kinase Cdk7/CycH, the phosphatase SSU72, and the endonuclease DNase I. NanoDSF utilizes intrinsic tryptophan and tyrosine fluorescence to monitor protein unfolding. Thermal stability nanoDSF measurements showed that 1,6-hexanediol destabilized all tested proteins in a concentration dependent manner (Fig. 3A). Cdk7/CycH exhibited thermal denaturation at 53.4 °C, while the addition of 5% 1,6-hexanediol destabilized Cdk7/CycH to 45 °C. Thermal stability of SSU72 phosphatase was reduced upon addition of 1,6-hexanediol by 4.6 °C from 51.1 to 46.5 °C, whereas DNase I displayed an inflection point of denaturation at 56.7 °C, which was lowered to 47 °C upon addition of 5% 1,6-hexanediol. For the examination of proper protein folding and accessibility, pull-down experiments with Cdk9/GST-CycT1 (1–272) and GST-Cdk7/CycH were used to clarify whether the overall complex formation of CDKs and cyclins was affected by 1,6-hexanediol. Cdk9/GST-CycT1 (1–272) and GST-Cdk7/CycH were coupled to GSH sepharose beads and incubated in PBS or in PBS containing 5% 1,6-hexanediol for 1 h (Fig. 3B). Beads were collected by centrifugation and washed three times in PBS or PBS-hexanediol. In contrast to the pronounced effects on protein stability, addition of 5% 1,6-hexanediol did not affect the Cdk/Cyclin interaction in pull-down assays. Neither the overall binding of GST to the GSH sepharose beads nor the Cdk/Cyclin interaction was affected, indicating that the overall structure of the proteins was not impaired at 5% 1,6-hexanediol. In a previous study, a CTD construct comprising all 52 repeats of the human RNA pol II was shown to undergo LLPS in the presence of 16% dextran in vitro, which can be monitored in a photometer by an increase in turbidity at a wavelength of 600 nm and by light microscopy (21Boehning M.

We were interested whether pol II CTD condensates could be dissolved at low 1,6-hexanediol concentrations, at which kinase activity is only mildly affected.

Methods Single-center clinical trial, with 3-week run-in and 12-week study period. DIY HCL system consisted of the Dana Diabecare RS insulin pump, Dexcom G5 continuous glucose monitoring system and AndroidAPS application. Primary outcome was safety: incidences of severe hypoglycemia, diabetic ketoacidosis, time spent in glycemia &lt;54 mg/dl. Secondary endpoints included percentage of time in range (TIR) 70–180 mg/dl, time below 70 mg/dl, HbA1c, insulin requirements, and body weight. Results In total 12 subjects (5 men, 7 women) were enrolled, mean age 31.3±6.7, 95%CI(27.7–34.9) years, mean diabetes duration 16.1±5.7, 95%CI(13.0–19.2) years. No episodes of severe hypoglycemia or ketoacidosis were observed. Percentage of time spent in glycemia below 54mg/dl was not increased. Average sensor glycemia was lower in the study period than baseline (141.1 ± 8.4, 95%CI(136.3–145.9) vs. 153.3 ± 17.9, 95%CI(143.2–163.4), mg/dl p&lt;0.001). TIR 70–180 mg/dl was improved by 11.3%, 95%CI(2.8%-19.8%) (from 68.0 ± 12.7 to 79.3 ± 6.4%, p&lt;0.001), without increasing hypoglycemia time. The HbA1c level decreased by -0.5%, 95%CI(-0.9%–-0.1%) (from 6.8 ± 0.5 to 6.3 ± 0.4%, p&lt;0.001). Additionally, in the last 4 weeks of the study period participants significantly improved and showed TIR 70–180 mg/dl 82.1 ± 5.6%, 95%CI(78.9–85.3), time &lt;54 mg/dl 0.30 (0.20–0.55)%, median 95%CI(0.1–0.7) and &lt;70 mg/dl 1.90 (1.10–3.05)%, median 95%CI(0.7–3.2). The insulin requirement and body weight did not change in the study. Conclusions The study revealed safety of the Do-It-Yourself HCL system AndroidAPS in adults with T1D, limited to well-controlled, highly selected and closely monitored patients. The use of AndroidAPS significantly improved HbA1c, time in range and average sensor glycemia without increasing hypoglycemia. As both patients and their medical team are gaining experience using the system over time, they improve glycemic control. Trial registration German Clinical Trials Register: no.

https://openalex.org/W3152279748,"Discovering safe and effective drugs that promote neuron regeneration is an essential strategy for the recovery of central nervous system injuries. In this study, we found that L-leucine, an essential amino acid obtained from both supplements and food sources, could dramatically boost axonal outgrowth and regeneration. First, the effects of L-leucine on neurons were evaluated by cell apoptosis, survival, and death assays, and the results showed no changes in these processes after treatment. By live cell imaging, L-leucine was found to remarkably increase axonal length and growth velocity after axotomy. We also verified that L-leucine enhanced p-mTOR/p-S6K activation in neurons by testing with an mTOR inhibitor, rapamycin. Thereafter, we investigated the effects of L-leucine on the spinal cord injury in vivo. A mouse model of spinal cord hemi-section was established, and L-leucine was administered by tail intravenous injection. Basso mouse scale values revealed that L-leucine could improve functional recovery after injury. It was also notable that L-leucine treatment promoted axon growth across chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan (CSPG) areas. Furthermore, we used CSPGs as inhibitory environmental cues and clarified that L-leucine significantly enhanced axonal outgrowth and regeneration by promoting p-mTOR and p-S6K activation. Therefore, our study is the first to report that L-leucine promotes axonal regeneration in vitro and in vivo and could be candidate drug for axonal re-growth and nervous functional recovery."
https://openalex.org/W3147920406,"Cannabidiol (CBD), a phytocannabinoid from the Cannabis sativa plant, exhibits a broad spectrum of potential therapeutic properties for neurodegenerative diseases. An accumulation of amyloid-β (Aβ) protein is one of the most important neuropathology in neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's disease (AD). Data on the effect of CBD on the amelioration of Aβ-induced neurite degeneration and its consequences of life and health spans is sparse. This study aimed to investigate the effects of CBD on neurite outgrowth in cells and lifespan and health span in Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans). In human SH-SY5Y neuronal cells, CBD prevented neurite lesion induced by Aβ1-42 and increased the expression of fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) and cannabinoid receptor 1 (CB1R). Furthermore, CBD both protected the reduction of dendritic spine density and rescued the activity of synaptic Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) from Aβ1-42 toxicity in primary hippocampal neurons. In C. elegans, we used the transgenic CL2355 strain of C. elegans, which expresses the human Aβ peptide throughout the nervous system and found that CBD treatment extended lifespan and improved health span. The neuroprotective effect of CBD was further explored by observing the dopaminergic neurons using transgenic dat-1: GFP strains using the confocal microscope. This study shows that CBD prevents the neurite degeneration induced by Aβ, by a mechanism involving CB1R activation, and extends lifespan and improves health span in Aβ-overexpressing worms. Our findings support the potential therapeutic approach of CBD for the treatment of AD patients."
https://openalex.org/W3150177493,"Background Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a systemic disease that can rapidly progress into acute respiratory failure and death. Timely identification of these patients is crucial for a proper administration of health-care resources. Objective To develop a predictive score that estimates the risk of invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) among patients with COVID-19. Study design Retrospective cohort study of 401 COVID-19 patients diagnosed from March 12, to August 10, 2020. The score development cohort comprised 211 patients (52.62% of total sample) whereas the validation cohort included 190 patients (47.38% of total sample). We divided participants according to the need of invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) and looked for potential predictive variables. Results We developed two predictive scores, one based on Interleukin-6 (IL-6) and the other one on the Neutrophil/Lymphocyte ratio (NLR), using the following variables: respiratory rate, SpO2/FiO2 ratio and lactic dehydrogenase (LDH). The area under the curve (AUC) in the development cohort was 0.877 (0.823–0.931) using the NLR based score and 0.891 (0.843–0.939) using the IL-6 based score. When compared with other similar scores developed for the prediction of adverse outcomes in COVID-19, the COVID-IRS scores proved to be superior in the prediction of IMV. Conclusion The COVID-IRS scores accurately predict the need for mechanical ventilation in COVID-19 patients using readily available variables taken upon admission. More studies testing the applicability of COVID-IRS in other centers and populations, as well as its performance as a triage tool for COVID-19 patients are needed."
https://openalex.org/W3145234003,"Fasting induces lipid accumulation in the liver, while the mechanisms by which fasting dysregulates liver fatty acid oxidation are not clear. Fatty acid ω-oxidation is induced in the fasting state, and administration of dicarboxylic acids to fasting animals decreases plasma ketone bodies. We hypothesized that endogenous dicarboxylic acids might play a role in controlling mitochondrial β-oxidation in fasting animals. A peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha agonist and an inhibitor for peroxisomal β-oxidation were administered to the fasting rats to investigate the role of dicarboxylic acids in liver fatty acid oxidation and lipid homeostasis. We observed that excessive β-oxidation of endogenous dicarboxylic acids by peroxisomes generated considerable levels of succinate in the liver. Excessive succinate oxidation subsequently increased the mitochondrial NADH/NAD<sup>+</sup> ratio and led to an accumulation of 3-OH-CoA and 2-enoyl-CoA intermediates in the liver. This further induced feedback suppression of mitochondrial β-oxidation and promoted hepatic lipid deposition and steatosis. Specific inhibition of peroxisomal β-oxidation attenuated fasting-induced lipid deposition in the liver by reducing succinate production and enhancing mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation. We conclude that suppression of mitochondrial β-oxidation by oxidation of dicarboxylic acids serves as a mechanism for fasting-induced hepatic lipid accumulation and identifies cross talk between peroxisomal and mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation."
https://openalex.org/W3142485208,"Betulinic acid (BA) is a naturally arising pentacyclic triterpenoid that has anti-malarial, anti-retroviral, anti-inflammatory, and anti-cancer biological effects. More recently, it has been reported to possess anti-obesity activity mediated by the activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). We further investigated antidiabetic activity of BA in mouse tissues at the cellular and systemic levels. We found that BA stimulated AMPK in a similar fashion to the known AMPK activators, such as 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide-1-β-D-ribofuranoside and metformin. Notably, the level of glucose uptake by BA was not altered by wortmannin, suggesting that this activation did not depend on phosphoinositide 3-kinase. Furthermore, BA diminished blood glucose levels in alloxane-treated ICR mice and in untreated mice during the glucose tolerance test. BA also stimulated mRNA expression of glucose transporter 4, which could partly explain increased glucose uptake. BA also increased AS160 phosphorylation by insulin-independent mechanisms in the extensor digitorum longus muscle. These results indicate that BA may serve as a promising therapeutic agent for diabetes by activating AMPK, like metformin. Notably, BA also enhanced mouse endurance capacity, indicating that it also affects metabolic regulation in addition to its antidiabetic activity."
https://openalex.org/W3144191098,"Objective The aim of this study is to find the most suitable heat wave definition among 15 different ones and to evaluate its impact on total, age-, and gender-specific mortality for Bandafassi, Senegal. Methods Daily weather station data were obtained from Kedougou situated at 17 km from Bandafassi from 1973 to 2012. Poisson generalized additive model (GAM) and distributed lag non-linear model (DLNM) are used to investigate the effect of heat wave on mortality and to evaluate the nonlinear association of heat wave definitions at different lag days, respectively. Results Heat wave definitions, based on three or more consecutive days with both daily minimum and maximum temperatures greater than the 90 th percentile, provided the best model fit. A statistically significant increase in the relative risk (RRs 1.4 (95% Confidence Interval (CI): 1.2–1.6), 1.7 (95% CI: 1.5–1.9), 1.21 (95% CI: 1.08–1.3), 1.2 (95% CI: 1.04–1.5), 1.5 (95% CI: 1.3–1.8), 1.4 (95% CI: 1.2–1.5), 1.5 (95% CI: 1.07–1.6), and 1.5 (95% CI: 1.3–1.8)) of total mortality was observed for eight definitions. By using the definition based on the 90 th percentile of minimum and maximum temperature with a 3-day duration, we also found that females and people aged ≥ 55 years old were at higher risks than males and other different age groups to heat wave related mortality. Conclusion The impact of heat waves was associated with total-, age-, gender-mortality. These results are expected to be useful for decision makers who conceive of public health policies in Senegal and elsewhere. Climate parameters, including temperatures and humidity, could be used to forecast heat wave risks as an early warning system in the area where we conduct this research. More broadly, our findings should be highly beneficial to climate services, researchers, clinicians, end-users and decision-makers."

We used a microarray to screen microRNAs that decreased in the process of osteoclast differentiation and verified miR-21-5p to decrease significantly using RT-qPCR.

These results suggest that miR-21-5p is a new therapeutic target for osteoporosis. Bone resorption of osteoclasts and formation of osteoblasts maintain homeostasis of bone tissue (1Datta H.K. Ng W.F. Walker J.A. Tuck S.P. Varanasi S.S. The cell biology of bone metabolism.J. Clin. Pathol. 2008; 61: 577-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). Osteoporosis occurs when bone resorption is greater than formation (2Armas L.A. Recker R.R. Pathophysiology of osteoporosis: New mechanistic insights.Endocrinol. Metab. Clin. North Am. 2012; 41: 475-486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar), and although it develops in both sexes, it is more prevalent in postmenopausal females and elderly males (3Li L. Wang Z. Ovarian aging and osteoporosis.Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 2018; 1086: 199-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The primarily available treatment against osteoporosis includes calcium, calcitonin, diphosphate, and estrogen. Calcium supplementation prevents and treats osteoporosis; however, its long-term use can induce nausea, vomiting, and indigestion. Moreover, since the absorption capacity declines with age, calcium efficacy in preventing and treating osteoporosis in elderly individuals is limited (4Weaver C.M. Alexander D.D. Boushey C.J. Dawson-Hughes B. Lappe J.M. LeBoff M.S. Liu S. Looker A.C. Wallace T.C. Wang D.D. Calcium plus vitamin D supplementation and risk of fractures: An updated meta-analysis from the National Osteoporosis Foundation.Osteoporos. Int. 2016; 27: 367-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). Calcitonin is effective in preventing and healing of new pyramidal fractures but also associated with side effects including nausea, vomiting, and flushing, and hence it is commonly used as a second-line therapy to treat osteoporosis (5Muñoz-Torres M. Alonso G. Raya M.P. Calcitonin therapy in osteoporosis.Treat. Endocrinol. 2004; 3: 117-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Bisphosphonates induce apoptosis in osteoclasts, thereby decreasing bone transformation, making them an ideal treatment option; however, long-term use can lead to overinhibition of bone remodeling and repair, resulting in excessive bone mineralization and destruction of bone microstructure (6Yuan F. Peng W. Yang C. Zheng J. Teriparatide versus bisphosphonates for treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis: A meta-analysis.Int. J. Surg. 2019; 66: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Estrogen is the most effective treatment strategy for postmenopausal females with osteoporosis; however, hormone replacement therapy is associated with adverse reactions in other systems. Estrogen is contraindicated in patients with allergies, breast cancer, thrombophlebitis, and vaginal bleeding of an unclear diagnosis, and is not used for osteoporosis treatment (7Väänänen H.K. Härkönen P.L. Estrogen and bone metabolism.Maturitas. 1996; 23 Suppl: S65-S69Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Considering all the above treatment options, safer and more effective treatments and prevention strategies for osteoporosis remain warranted. microRNAs are short sequences RNA with a length of approximately 20 to 24 nt that do not encode proteins. Accumulating evidence has illustrated the important role of miRNAs in osteoporosis (8Mohr A.M. Mott J.L. Overview of microRNA biology.Semin. Liver Dis. 2015; 35: 3-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (712) Google Scholar). In recent studies, it has been found that microRNA-29a reduces osteoclast differentiation by inhibiting osteoclast regulators RANKL and CXCL12 (9Lian W.S. Ko J.Y. Chen Y.S. Ke H.J. Hsieh C.K. Kuo C.W. Wang S.Y. Huang B.W. Tseng J.G. Wang F.S. MicroRNA-29a represses osteoclast formation and protects against osteoporosis by regulating PCAF-mediated RANKL and CXCL12.Cell Death Dis. 2019; 10: 705Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In addition, the expression of microRNA-148a in osteoporosis rat model following ovariectomy has been shown to be significantly upregulated and that it can affect osteoporosis through ERα by the PI3K/AKT axis (10Xiao Y. Li B. Liu J. MicroRNA-148a inhibition protects against ovariectomy-induced osteoporosis through PI3K/AKT signaling by estrogen receptor α.Mol. Med. Rep. 2018; 17: 7789-7796PubMed Google Scholar). The authors also investigated the role of microRNA-449b-5p in osteogenic differentiation of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) and found that microRNA-449b-5p could aggravate osteoporosis by inhibiting osteogenic differentiation through targeting Satb2 (11Li J.Y. Wei X. Sun Q. Zhao X.Q. Zheng C.Y. Bai C.X. Du J. Zhang Z. Zhu L.G. Jia Y.S. MicroRNA-449b-5p promotes the progression of osteoporosis by inhibiting osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs via targeting Satb2.Eur. Rev. Med. Pharmacol. Sci. 2019; 23: 6394-6403PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, investigating miRNAs in osteoporosis may provide an insight into new therapeutic targets. S-Phase Kinase-Associated Protein 2 (SKP2) is a protein-coding gene, which significantly affects cell cycle regulation (12Cai Z. Moten A. Peng D. Hsu C.C. Pan B.S. Manne R. Li H.Y. Lin H.K. The Skp2 pathway: A critical target for cancer therapy.Semin. Cancer Biol. 2020; 67: 16-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). In breast cancer, SKP2 promotes tumourigenesis and radiation tolerance by degrading PDCD4 (13Li C. Du L. Ren Y. Liu X. Jiao Q. Cui D. Wen M. Wang C. Wei G. Wang Y. Ji A. Wang Q. SKP2 promotes breast cancer tumorigenesis and radiation tolerance through PDCD4 ubiquitination.J. Exp. Clin. Cancer Res. 2019; 38: 76Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Runx2, an osteogenic transcription factor, affects osteoblasts differentiation; SKP2 inhibits osteogenesis through ubiquitin-mediated degradation of Runx2 (14Thacker G. Kumar Y. Khan M.P. Shukla N. Kapoor I. Kanaujiya J.K. Lochab S. Ahmed S. Sanyal S. Chattopadhyay N. Trivedi A.K. Skp2 inhibits osteogenesis by promoting ubiquitin-proteasome degradation of Runx2.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2016; 1863: 510-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). In this study, we hypothesize that SKP2 is a target gene of miR-21-5p and verified the function of SKP2 in osteoclastic differentiation. To better understand these effects, we screened miRNAs differentially expressed during receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa B ligand (RANKL)-induced osteoclast differentiation in vitro using RAW264.7 cells. Based on the screening results, we focused on miR-21-5p as a potential target for osteoporosis treatment, which was downregulated in mature osteoclasts. Bioinformatics analysis was conducted to predict target genes of miR-21-5p. Moreover, we evaluated the influence of a precursor miR-21-5p drug in the prevention of osteoporosis in ovariectomized (OVX) mice to determine the therapeutic potential. TRAP-positive multinucleated cells were observed in the RANKL-stimulated group, whereas no TRAP-positive cells were found in the control group (Fig. 1A). In addition, RT-qPCR analysis showed that the mRNA expression levels of TRAP and cathepsin K were increased in the RANKL-induced group compared with those in the control group (Fig. 1B) (15Yin Z. Zhu W. Wu Q. Zhang Q. Guo S. Liu T. Li S. Chen X. Peng D. Ouyang Z.

Pharmacol. 2019; 859: 172550Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Mouse bone marrow macrophages (BMMs) were induced by M-CSF and RANKL, and depressions in the surface of the bone slice were observed (Fig. 1C) (16Chen X. Ouyang Z. Shen Y. Liu B. Zhang Q. Wan L. Yin Z. Zhu W. Li S. Peng D. CircRNA_28313/miR-195a/CSF1 axis modulates osteoclast differentiation to affect OVX-induced bone absorption in mice.RNA Biol. 2019; 16: 1249-1262Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). These results confirmed RANKL induction of macrophages differentiation into osteoclasts. We selected five pairs of samples for sequencing, which were not induced by RANKL or RANKL, for 5 days. Twenty out of the microRNAs significantly downregulated (p < 0.05, logFC < −2) during osteoclastic differentiation were selected (Fig. 1D). Furthermore, we detected the expression of microRNAs (p < 0.05, logFC < −3) during osteoclast differentiation using RT-qPCR (Fig. 1E). Among them, the expression of miR-21-5p decreased most significantly, and hence was selected for further investigations, and speculated that it can inhibit osteoclast growth, differentiation, or function. To further investigate the role of miR-21-5p in osteoclastogenesis as a potential target for osteoporosis treatment, RAW264.7 cells were transfected with vectors to silence or overexpress miRNAs (Fig. 2A), followed by treatment with RANKL for osteoclast differentiation. CCK-8 assay showed that cell growth in the miR-21-5p overexpression group was weaker than that in the miR-21-5p-silenced group (Fig. 2B) (17Wang L. Gao Z. Zhang J. Huo Y. Xu Q. Qiu Y. Netrin-1 regulates ERK1/2 signaling pathway and autophagy activation in wear particle-induced osteoclastogenesis.Cell Biol. Int. 2021; 45: 612-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Similarly, TRAP staining of the induced osteoclasts showed numerous TRAP-positive multinucleated cells in the anti-miR-21-5p group, whereas osteoclast formation was inhibited in the miR-21-5p overexpression group (Fig. 2C) (18Song C. Yang X. Lei Y. Zhang Z. Smith W. Yan J. Kong L. Evaluation of efficacy on RANKL induced osteoclast from RAW264.7 cells.J. Cell Physiol. 2019; 234: 11969-11975Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Western blot and RT-qPCR further showed that the protein and mRNA levels of TRAP, cathepsin K, MMP-2, and MMP-9 were decreased in the miR-21-5p overexpression group and increased in the anti-miR-21-5p group compared with those in control cells (Fig. 2, D and E) (19Sun L. Lian J.X. Meng S. MiR-125a-5p promotes osteoclastogenesis by targeting TNFRSF1B.Cell. Mol. Biol. Lett. 2019; 24: 23Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The migration rate of osteoclast precursors was positively correlated with the differentiation and activity of osteoclasts, while the Transwell assays showed that the migration rate of osteoclast precursors transfected with miR-21-5p was decreased and that of cells transfected with anti-miR-21-5p increased (Fig. 2F) (20Gan K. Yang L. Xu L. Feng X. Zhang Q. Wang F. Tan W. Zhang M. Iguratimod (T-614) suppresses RANKL-induced osteoclast differentiation and migration in RAW264.7 cells via NF-κB and MAPK pathways.Int. Immunopharmacol. 2016; 35: 294-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Bone slices were covered with BMM cells transfected with miR-21-5p or anti-miR-21-5p and induced by M-CSF and RANKL. Following miR-21-5p inhibition, the osteoclast activity became stronger, while deeper and larger depressions on the surface of the bone slices were observed, as visualized using scanning electron microscope imaging (Fig. 2G) (21Xie Z. Yu H. Sun X. Tang P. Jie Z. Chen S. Wang J. Qin A. Fan S. A novel diterpenoid suppresses osteoclastogenesis and promotes osteogenesis by inhibiting Ifrd1-mediated and IκBα-mediated p65 nuclear translocation.J. Bone Miner. Res. 2018; 33: 667-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Collectively, these results demonstrate that miR-21-5p inhibits osteoclast differentiation and activity. The expression levels of 18 possible target genes predicted using the four databases (Fig. 3A) were measured when miR-21-5p was overexpressed in RAW264.7 cells. Genes with significantly decreased expression were selected (SOX5, NFIB, SKP2, and XKR6) (Fig. 3B). We designed the corresponding siRNA to transfect RAW264.7 cells, followed by osteoclast differentiation induction with RANKL. Among these, SKP2 inhibition successfully inhibited osteoclast differentiation (Fig. 3C). The predicted binding sites of SKP2 are shown in Figure 3D. Si SKP2 was transfected into RAW264.7 cells, and the expression of SKP2 was detected using RT-qPCR (Fig. 3E). During osteoclast differentiation, SKP2 was closely correlated with cell proliferation efficiency, when its expression was inhibited, cell proliferation was decreased (Fig. 3F). In addition, the expression levels of TRAP, cathepsin K, MMP2, and MMP9 also decreased following SKP2 inhibition (Fig. 3, G and H). In the Transwell experiment, when the expression of SKP2 was decreased, the migration ability of preosteoclasts also decreased (Fig. 3I). The bone absorption assay showed that SKP2 was involved in osteoclast activity, which was decreased upon SKP2 inhibition (Fig. 3J). This suggests that SKP2 affected the growth, differentiation, and function of osteoclasts. Next, we designed a rescue experiment to determine whether miR-21-5p acts on osteoclasts by regulating SKP2. The expression of SKP2 was detected using RT-qPCR (Fig. 3K). Cell proliferation was increased when miR-21-5p and SKP2 were transfected at the same time (Fig. 3L). This rescue effect of SKP2 was confirmed by the large number of TRAP-positive multinucleated cells in the cotransfection group (Fig. 3M). Changes in osteoclast and migration-related proteins and mRNAs corresponded to the patterns observed at the cellular level (Fig. 3, N and O). When SKP2 was overexpressed, the migration and invasion abilities of osteoclast precursors were enhanced (Fig. 3P); bone absorption assay showed that the osteoclast activity was inhibited when miR-21-5p was overexpressed; however, SKP2 reversed this effect (Fig. 3Q). This suggests that miR-21-5p can inhibit osteoclasts possibly by targeting SKP2. We selected 40 healthy 6-week-old female mice and excised their ovaries bilaterally via a small mid-back incision (Fig. 4A) (22Li J. Li X. Liu D. Hamamura K. Wan Q. Na S. Yokota H. Zhang P. eIF2α signaling regulates autophagy of osteoblasts and the development of osteoclasts in OVX mice.Cell Death Dis. 2019; 10: 921Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). After 8 weeks, OVX mice were fully recovered and randomly divided into two groups, of which one was injected with precontrol via the tail vein, and the other received pre-miR-21-5p intravenously, once a week for 8 weeks. The groups were further randomly divided into two subgroups, each of which was injected with either AD control or AD SKP2 via the tail vein, once a week for 8 weeks (Fig. 4B). After the mice were sacrificed, the humerus was collected to extract RNA, and the femurs for microCT analysis, of which the right femurs were sectioned and stained. First, we detected the expression levels of miR-21-5p and SKP2, which were consistent with the injected drugs: The expression levels of miR-21-5p and SKP2 have increased accordingly (Fig. 4, C and D). Furthermore, the microCT results showed that the increased expression of miR-21-5p inhibited osteoporosis; conversely, the increased expression of SKP2 promoted its progression. In addition, our results also demonstrated that miR-21-5p could prevent osteoporosis by targeting SKP2 (Fig. 4E). The sectioned bone tissues were stained with H&E, anti-TRAP, and anti-cathepsin K antibodies. We observed several osteoclasts scattered in the bone cavity of osteoporotic mice. Importantly, miR-21-5p and SKP2 inhibited and promoted the growth of osteoclasts, respectively; miR-21-5p inhibited osteoclastogenesis via SKP2 (Fig. 4F). In addition, RT-qPCR and western blot results showed that miR-21-5p inhibited the expression of TRAP and cathepsin K, while SKP2 promoted their expression. This effect was mediated by the regulatory effect of miR-21-5p on SKP2 (Fig. 4, G–I). Overall, our in vivo results further show that miR-21-5p and SKP2 negatively and positively impact osteoclasts, respectively, and that SKP2 is a downstream target of miR-21-5p. After screening for miRNAs differentially expressed during osteoclast differentiation using gene chip technology, we found that the level of miR-21-5p was significantly decreased in mature osteoclasts, suggesting a potential role in osteoclastogenesis. This role was confirmed by in vitro experiments in which miR-21-5p overexpression significantly inhibited the differentiation and activity of osteoclasts at the molecular level. Moreover, one of the predicted target genes of miR-21-5p, SKP2, was significantly upregulated during osteoclast differentiation, and its overexpression reversed the inhibitory effect of miR-21-5p. Collectively, these results indicate that miR-21-5p may act on osteoclast differentiation through SKP2, highlighting it as a potential therapeutic target for osteoporosis. The degree of osteoporosis in the femur bone was reduced in an OVX mouse model injected with pre-miR-21-5p, demonstrating the effects of miRNA on osteoporosis. More than 2000 mature miRNAs have been identified in the human body to date, which regulate more than 50% of all protein-coding genes. Accumulating evidence has demonstrated that miRNAs regulate osteoclast differentiation, maturation, and apoptosis through complex signaling pathway networks (23Kabekkodu S.P. Shukla V. Varghese V.K. D' Souza J. Chakrabarty S. Satyamoorthy K. Clustered miRNAs and their role in biological functions and diseases.Biol. Rev. Camb. Philos. Soc. 2018; 93: 1955-1986Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). For example, miR-214-3p transferred from osteoclasts inhibited the activity of osteoblasts in vitro and reduced bone formation in vivo (24Li D. Liu J. Guo B. Liang C. Dang L. Lu C. He X. Cheung H.Y. Xu L. Lu C. He B. Liu B. Shaikh A.B. Li F. Wang L. et al.Osteoclast-derived exosomal miR-214-3p inhibits osteoblastic bone formation.Nat. Commun. 2016; 7: 10872Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar); TGFβ1/SMAD4 signaling has been shown to affect osteoclast differentiation by regulating the expression of miR-155 (25Zhao H. Zhang J. Shao H. Liu J. Jin M. Chen J. Huang Y. Transforming growth factor β1/Smad4 signaling affects osteoclast differentiation via regulation of miR-155 expression.Mol. Cells. 2017; 40: 211-221PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, miR-506 regulates osteoclast formation by targeting SIRT1 expression and modulating the TRPV1 channel, reactive oxygen species production, and TNF-α (26Yan S. Miao L. Lu Y. Wang L. MicroRNA-506 upregulation contributes to sirtuin 1 inhibition of osteoclastogenesis in bone marrow stromal cells induced by TNF-α treatment.Cell Biochem. Funct. 2019; 37: 598-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Although the influence of miRNAs on osteoclasts has been extensively studied, data on targeted regulation of miRNAs in osteoclasts for osteoporosis treatment remain limited. In cancer, SKP2 acts as a proto-oncogene. When the expression of SKP2 is decreased, the invasion and lung metastasis of osteosarcoma are inhibited (27Zhang Y. Zvi Y.S. Batko B. Zaphiros N. O'Donnell E.F. Wang J. Sato K. Yang R. Geller D.S. Koirala P. Zhang W. Du X. Piperdi S. Liu Y. Zheng D. et al.Down-regulation of Skp2 expression inhibits invasion and lung metastasis in osteosarcoma.Sci. Rep. 2018; 8: 14294Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). SKP2 is a potential therapeutic target to inhibit the invasion of cancer cells and enhance drug sensitivity. However, data on its role in osteoclast differentiation are limited. Target genes related to miR-21-5p can be influenced through microRNAs to treat osteoporosis. Selective inhibition of SKP2 expression can inhibit the differentiation of osteoclasts. Although our study suggests miR-21-5p as a promising therapeutic targeted against osteoporosis, the development of miRNA-based drugs remains challenging. Importantly, miRNAs do not follow a “one-to-one” model of targets but rather a “one-to-many” model; hence, a given miRNA will induce side effects on other target genes. No methods are currently available for controlling this side effect, and the severity of potential effects remains unknown (28Zhang Y. Wang Z. Gemeinhart R.A. Progress in microRNA delivery.J. Control. Release. 2013; 172: 962-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar), which warrant further investigations. The mouse macrophage cell line RAW264.7 was obtained from the Cell Bank of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CBTCCCAS). RAW264.7 cells were cultured in minimum essential medium-alpha modified (α-MEM) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). RAW264.7 cells were treated with 50 ng/ml RANKL (R&D Systems) to induce their differentiation into osteoclasts. On the fifth day of differentiation, the osteoclasts were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min at room temperature (25 °C) and then stained for TRAP (Sigma) and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. After staining, the TRAP solution was discarded, and the cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (Sigma) three times. TRAP-positive multinucleated cells were then observed and counted under an inverted microscope. The miR-21-5p mimetic, anti-miR-21-5p, and SKP2 mRNA vectors were synthesized by RIBO Biotech. iMAXTransfection Reagent was used to transfect the cells for 24 h according to the manufacturer’s instructions. About 1000 cells were seeded and cultured in 96-well plates for 0, 24, 72, and 120 h to measure the growth rate after transfection. Cell viability was assessed with the Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) assay (Dojindo Molecular Technology); 10% CCK-8 reagent was added to each well and the cells were incubated at 37 °C for an additional 2 h. The optical density value of cells was directly detected on an ELx800 Absorbance Microplate Reader (BioTek Instruments) at 450 nm. The migration rate of osteoclast precursors is also an important index for evaluating the activity of osteoclasts. A 200-μL cell suspension without FBS (10,000 cells/ml) was added to the inner chamber of the Transwell plate, and the lower chamber was filled with empty medium containing 10% FBS. After 24 h of incubation, the lower surface of the chamber membrane was fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and stained with 0.1% crystal violet, and invading cells were observed under a bright-field microscope. BMM cells (10,000 cells/cm2) were covered on the surface of the bone slices and then induced to differentiate by M-CSF (100 ng/ml) and RANKL (50 ng/ml) after transfection. After cell culture, adherent cells were cleaned with trypsin and sonication. The depression on the surface of the bone slice was scanned using an electron microscope (HITACHI, TM-1000), and the images obtained were quantitatively analyzed with ImageJ (NIH). RNA was extracted from the cells in each group, and 1 μg total RNA was reverse-transcribed into cDNA using 2 μl of 5X PrimeScript RT Master Mix (Takara Bio) and 4 μl RNase-free distilled water to obtain a total volume of 10 μl. The cDNA was then used as a template in qPCR on an ABI Prism 7500 system (Applied Biosystems) with SYBR Green QPCR Master Mix (Takara Bio). Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (Gapdh) was used as a normalization control gene. The primer sequences were as follows: SKP2 (forward: 5′-TTGTTCTCCCAGTCACCCTCC-3′ and reverse: 5′-AGCCGTGGACTAAAGATAGGCA-3′), Trap (forward: 5′- GACCCACCGCCAAGATGGAT-3′ and reverse: 5′- CACGGTTCTGGCGATCTCTT-3′), cathepsin K (forward: 5′- TCCGCAATCCTTACCGAATA-3′ and reverse: 5′-AACTTGAACACCCACATCCTG-3′), matrix metalloproteinase (Mmp)9 (forward: 5′- CGCTCATGTACCCGCTGTAT-3′ and reverse: 5′- CCGTGGGAGGTATAGTGGGA-3′), Mmp2 (forward: 5′-CCACGGGCCCTATCATCTTC-3′ and reverse: 5′- CAGCACCTTTCTTTGGGCAC-3′), Gapdh (forward: 5′- AGCAAGGACACTGAGCAAGA-3′ and reverse: 5′- GGGGTCTGGGATGGAAATTGT-3′), miR-21-5p (forward: 5′-CCGCGTAGCTTATCAGACTGATGTTGA-3′). Total protein was extracted from the cells by mixing with radioimmunoprecipitation assay lysis buffer (Sigma-Aldrich), and the supernatant was collected after centrifugation at 12,000g for 15 min. The proteins were separated using 10% sodium dodecyl sulfate–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred onto a polyvinylidene fluoride membrane (Bio-Rad). The membrane was blocked with 5% skim milk powder in TBST (50 mm Tris, pH 7.6; 150 mM NaCl; 0.1% Tween 20) at room temperature for 1 h and incubated with the primary antibodies against osteoclast-related proteins TRAP, cathepsin K, MMP-2, and MMP-9 at 4 °C overnight (1:1,000, Abcam). Cathepsin K and TRAP are important indicators of osteoclast activity, and MMP-2 and MMP-9 reflect cell migration ability. After washing with TBST, the membrane was further incubated with the secondary antibody at room temperature for 2 h. The protein bands were visualized with an LAS-4000 Science Imaging System (Fujifilm) and analyzed with ImageJ software (National Institutes of Health). To explore the mechanisms by which miR-21-5p affects osteoclast differentiation, we used three separate databases to identify miR-21-5p target genes: TargetScan (http://www.targetscan.org), miRTarBase (http://mirtarbase.mbc.nctu.edu.tw/php/index.php), RNA22 (https://cm.jefferson.edu/rna22/Interactive/), and miRDB (http://www.mirdb.org/) (29Wang S.

Identification and validation of key miRNAs and a microRNA-mRNA regulatory network associated with ulcerative colitis.DNA Cell Biol. 2021; 40: 147-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). We established an OVX-induced osteoporosis model to determine the effects of miR-21-5p on osteoporosis in vivo. All animal experiments were performed in accordance with the principles and procedures of the National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and the guidelines for the animal treatment of Sir Run Shaw Hospital (Zhejiang University affiliated, Hangzhou, Zhejiang). The bilateral ovaries were removed through an incision on the back of 8-week-old female C57 mice to establish an OVX model. In brief, the mice were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of 10% chloral hydrate (0.4 ml/100 g) and placed in the prone position. The hair was cut at 0.5 cm above the inner side of the thigh root on the back, the skin was sterilized and cut, and the muscle was separated bluntly. The ovary was stripped and removed after the uterus was ligated to stop the bleeding. The muscle layer and skin incision were sutured, and penicillin was injected to prevent infection. The other ovary was removed following the same procedure. The adenovirus precontrol, pre-miR-21-5p, control, and SKP2 were constructed and provided by Hanbio Biotechnology (Shanghai) Co, Ltd. After successful OVX modeling, mice were intraperitoneally injected with adenovirus solution once a week for 8 weeks. A 100 μl solution containing circSPG21-wt or -mut was slowly injected into the abdominal cavity. Data represent mean ± standard deviation (SD) and the p values were determined with a two-tailed unpaired Student’s t-test (using the 95% confidence interval of the difference between groups) using SPSS v22.0. Differences between groups with p < 0.05 were considered statistically different. All data included in this study are available upon request by contact with the corresponding author.

https://openalex.org/W3145726482,"To identify hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related lncRNA(s), we previously examined the transcription profiles of the HBV-transgenic cell line HepG2-4D14 and parental HepG2 cells by RNA deep sequencing and identified 38 upregulated long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs). In the present study, the lncRNA MAFG-AS1 is investigated in detail because its gene is located adjacent to the MAFG gene, which is an important transcription factor involved in cell proliferation. The level of MAFG-AS1 is significantly higher in HCC tissue than in nontumor tissues. TCGA data show that the expression level of MAFG-AS1 is negatively correlated with survival of HCC patients. GEO cohort data show that compared with healthy tissues, the expression level of MAFG-AS1 is significantly higher in HBV-infected liver tissues. Real-time PCR and luciferase reporter assay data show that HBx can enhance the transcription of MAFG-AS1. Gain-of-function and loss-of-function experiments indicate that MAFG-AS1 promotes proliferation, migration, and invasion of HCC cells. Tumor formation assay results demonstrate that knockdown of MAFG-AS1 significantly inhibits cell proliferation in nude mice. Furthermore, MAFG-AS1 enhances the transcription of adjacent MAFG via E2F1. Additionally, MAFG-AS1 interacts with three subunits (MYH9, MYL12B, and MYL6) of nonmuscle myosin IIA (NM IIA). Knockdown of MAFG-AS1 inhibits ATPase activity of MYH9, interaction of NM IIA subunits, and cell cycle progression. Thus, the lncRNA MAFG-AS1 is upregulated by HBV and promotes proliferation and migration of HCC cells. Our findings suggest that MAFG-AS1 is a potential oncogene that may contribute to HBV-related HCC development."

This study aimed to evaluate the surface roughness, plaque accumulation, and cytotoxicity of provisional restorative materials fabricated by the conventional, digital subtractive and additive methods. Sixty-six bar-shaped specimens (2×4×10 mm) were fabricated by using provisional restorative materials through the conventional, digital subtractive and additive methods (n = 22 per group). Ten specimens of each group were used for surface roughness and plaque accumulation tests, 10 specimens for cytotoxicity assay, and 2 specimens of each group were used for qualitative assessment by scanning electron microscopy. The R a (roughness average) and R z (roughness height) values (μm) were measured via profilometer, and visual inspection was performed through scanning electron microscopy. Plaque accumulation of Streptococcus mutans and cytotoxicity on human gingival fibroblast-like cells were evaluated. The data were analyzed with one-way ANOVA and Tukey’s post hoc test (α = 0.05). Surface roughness, biofilm accumulation and cytotoxicity were significantly different among the groups (P&lt;0.05). Surface roughness was significantly higher in the conventional group (P&lt;0.05); however, the two other groups were not significantly different (P&gt;0.05). Significantly higher bacterial attachment was observed in the additive group than the subtractive (P&lt;0.001) and conventional group (P = 0.025); while, the conventional and subtractive groups were statistically similar (P = 0.111). Regarding the cytotoxicity, the additive group had significantly higher cell viability than the subtractive group (P = 0.006); yet, the conventional group was not significantly different from the additive (P = 0.354) and subtractive group (P = 0.101). Surface roughness was the highest in conventionally cured group; but, the additive group had the most plaque accumulation and lowest cytotoxicity."
https://openalex.org/W3139758175,"The neuronal Na+-activated K+ channel Slack (aka Slo2.2, KNa1.1, or Kcnt1) has been implicated in setting and maintaining the resting membrane potential and defining excitability and firing patterns, as well as in the generation of the slow afterhyperpolarization following bursts of action potentials. Slack activity increases significantly under conditions of high intracellular Na+ levels, suggesting this channel may exert important pathophysiological functions. To address these putative roles, we studied whether Slack K+ channels contribute to pathological changes and excitotoxic cell death caused by glutamatergic overstimulation of Ca2+- and Na+-permeable N-methyl-D-aspartic acid receptors (NMDAR). Slack-deficient (Slack KO) and wild-type (WT) mice were subjected to intrastriatal microinjections of the NMDAR agonist NMDA. NMDA-induced brain lesions were significantly increased in Slack KO vs WT mice, suggesting that the lack of Slack renders neurons particularly susceptible to excitotoxicity. Accordingly, excessive neuronal cell death was seen in Slack-deficient primary cerebellar granule cell (CGC) cultures exposed to glutamate and NMDA. Differences in neuronal survival between WT and Slack KO CGCs were largely abolished by the NMDAR antagonist MK-801, but not by NBQX, a potent and highly selective competitive antagonist of α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA)-type ionotropic glutamate receptors. Interestingly, NMDAR-evoked Ca2+ signals did not differ with regard to Slack genotype in CGCs. However, real-time monitoring of K+ following NMDAR activation revealed a significant contribution of this channel to the intracellular drop in K+. Finally, TrkB and TrkC neurotrophin receptor transcript levels were elevated in NMDA-exposed Slack-proficient CGCs, suggesting a mechanism by which this K+ channel contributes to the activation of the extracellular-signal-regulated kinase (Erk) pathway and thereby to neuroprotection. Combined, our findings suggest that Slack-dependent K+ signals oppose the NMDAR-mediated excitotoxic neuronal injury by promoting pro-survival signaling via the BDNF/TrkB and Erk axis."
https://openalex.org/W3140524582,"Circadian clock is involved in regulating most renal physiological functions, including water and electrolyte balance and blood pressure homeostasis, however, the role of circadian clock in renal pathophysiology remains largely unknown. Here we aimed to investigate the role of Bmal1, a core clock component, in the development of renal fibrosis, the hallmark of pathological features in many renal diseases. The inducible Bmal1 knockout mice (iKO) whose gene deletion occurred in adulthood were used in the study. Analysis of the urinary water, sodium and potassium excretion showed that the iKO mice exhibit abolished diurnal variations. In the model of renal fibrosis induced by unilateral ureteral obstruction, the iKO mice displayed significantly decreased tubulointerstitial fibrosis reflected by attenuated collagen deposition and mitigated expression of fibrotic markers α-SMA and fibronectin. The hedgehog pathway transcriptional effectors Gli1 and Gli2, which have been reported to be involved in the pathogenesis of renal fibrosis, were significantly decreased in the iKO mice. Mechanistically, ChIP assay and luciferase reporter assay revealed that BMAL1 bound to the promoter of and activate the transcription of Gli2, but not Gli1, suggesting that the involvement of Bmal1 in renal fibrosis was possibly mediated via Gli2-dependent mechanisms. Furthermore, treatment with TGF-β increased Bmal1 in cultured murine proximal tubular cells. Knockdown of Bmal1 abolished, while overexpression of Bmal1 increased, Gli2 and the expression of fibrosis-related genes. Collectively, these results revealed a prominent role of the core clock gene Bmal1 in tubulointerstitial fibrosis. Moreover, we identified Gli2 as a novel target of Bmal1, which may mediate the adverse effect of Bmal1 in obstructive nephropathy."

Studies focusing on work-related stress among vehicle repair workers are scarce in African countries. The current study aimed to determine the prevalence of self-reported workplace stress and associated factors among vehicle repair workers in Hawassa City, South Ethiopia. Methods and findings A cross-sectional study design was employed among 347 vehicle repair workers from January 25 to February 22, 2019. Questionnaires were administered using interviews. Additional tools were used for weight and height measurements. The main findings were analyzed using descriptive statistics, bivariable, and multivariable logistic regression. The strength of association of variables was presented by odds ratio along with its 95% CI. The statistical assessments were considered significant at p &lt;0.05. A total of 344 workers participated in the study. The prevalence of workplace stress among participants was 41.6% with 95% CI: (36.3–47.1). Factors associated with workplace stress were more than 10 years of work experience [AOR: 2.40; 95% CI (1.29–4.50)], work-related musculoskeletal disorder [AOR: 3.39; 95% CI (1.99–5.78)], squatting and lying work posture [AOR: 4.63; 95% CI (1.61–13.3)] and servicing large vehicles [AOR: 1.96; 95% CI (1.14–3.38)]. Conclusion and recommendations This study showed that the overall prevalence of work-related stress was substantially high. The independently associated factors were workers’ service years, symptoms of body pain, and the work environment. Preventive measures need to be implemented in vehicle repair workshops by focusing on work environment improvements."
https://openalex.org/W3147949864,"Bread wheat ( Triticum aestivum L) is one of the three main staple crops worldwide contributing 20% calories in the human diet. Drought stress is the main factor limiting yields and threatening food security, with climate change resulting in more frequent and intense drought. Developing drought-tolerant wheat cultivars is a promising way forward. The use of holistic approaches that include high-throughput phenotyping and genetic markers in selection could help in accelerating genetic gains. Fifty advanced breeding lines were selected from the CIMMYT Turkey winter wheat breeding program and studied under irrigated and semiarid conditions in two years. High-throughput phenotyping was done for wheat crown root traits and canopy senescence dynamics using vegetation indices (green area using RGB images and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index using spectral reflectance). In addition, genotyping by KASP markers for adaptability genes was done. Overall, under semiarid conditions yield reduced by 3.09 t ha -1 (-46.8%) compared to irrigated conditions. Genotypes responded differently under drought stress and genotypes 39 (VORONA/HD24-12//GUN/7/VEE#8//…/8/ALTAY), 18 (BiII98) and 29 (NIKIFOR//KROSHKA) were the most drought tolerant. Root traits including shallow nodal root angle under irrigated conditions and root number per shoot under semiarid conditions were correlated with increased grain yield. RGB based vegetation index measuring canopy green area at anthesis was better correlated with GY than NDVI was with GY under drought. The markers for five established functional genes ( PRR73 . A1 –flowering time, TEF-7A –grain size and weight, TaCwi . 4A - yield under drought, Dreb1 - drought tolerance, and ISBW11 . GY . QTL . CANDIDATE - grain yield) were associated with different drought-tolerance traits in this experiment. We conclude that–genotypes 39, 18 and 29 could be used for drought tolerance breeding. The trait combinations of canopy green area at anthesis, and root number per shoot along with key drought adaptability makers ( TaCwi . 4A and Dreb1 ) could be used in screening drought tolerance wheat breeding lines."

https://openalex.org/W3139576457,"Glycolysis is a well-known process by which metabolically active cells, such as tumor or immune cells meet their high metabolic demands. Previously, our laboratory has demonstrated that in airway epithelial cells, the pleiotropic cytokine, interleukin-1 beta (IL1B) induces glycolysis and that this contributes to allergic airway inflammation and remodeling. Activation of glycolysis is known to increase NADPH reducing equivalents generated from the pentose phosphate pathway, linking metabolic reprogramming with redox homeostasis. In addition, numerous glycolytic enzymes are known to be redox regulated. However, whether and how redox chemistry regulates metabolic reprogramming more generally remains unclear. In this study, we employed a multi-omics approach in primary mouse airway basal cells to evaluate the role of protein redox biochemistry, specifically protein glutathionylation, in mediating metabolic reprogramming. Our findings demonstrate that IL1B induces glutathionylation of multiple proteins involved in metabolic regulation, notably in the glycolysis pathway. Cells lacking Glutaredoxin-1 (Glrx), the enzyme responsible for reversing glutathionylation, show modulation of multiple metabolic pathways including an enhanced IL1B-induced glycolytic response. This was accompanied by increased secretion of thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP), a cytokine important in asthma pathogenesis. Targeted inhibition of glycolysis prevented TSLP release, confirming the functional relevance of enhanced glycolysis in cells stimulated with IL1B. Collectively, data herein point to an intriguing link between glutathionylation chemistry and glycolytic reprogramming in epithelial cells and suggest that glutathionylation chemistry may represent a therapeutic target in pulmonary pathologies with perturbations in the glycolysis pathway."
https://openalex.org/W3140983589,"One of the endogenous estrogens, 17β-estradiol (E2 ) is a female steroid hormone secreted from the ovary. It is well established that E2 causes biochemical and histological changes in the uterus. However, it is not completely understood how E2 regulates the oviductal environment in vivo. In this study, we assessed the effect of E2 on each oviductal cell type, using an ovariectomized-hormone-replacement mouse model, single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq), in situ hybridization, and cell-type-specific deletion in mice. We found that each cell type in the oviduct responded to E2 distinctively, especially ciliated and secretory epithelial cells. The treatment of exogenous E2 did not drastically alter the transcriptomic profile from that of endogenous E2 produced during estrus. Moreover, we have identified and validated genes of interest in our datasets that may be used as cell- and region-specific markers in the oviduct. Insulin-like growth factor 1 (Igf1) was characterized as an E2 -target gene in the mouse oviduct and was also expressed in human fallopian tubes. Deletion of Igf1 in progesterone receptor (Pgr)-expressing cells resulted in female subfertility, partially due to an embryo developmental defect and embryo retention within the oviduct. In summary, we have shown that oviductal cell types, including epithelial, stromal, and muscle cells, are differentially regulated by E2 and support gene expression changes, such as growth factors that are required for normal embryo development and transport in mouse models. Furthermore, we have identified cell-specific and region-specific gene markers for targeted studies and functional analysis in vivo."

This continuous addition of neurons to pre-existing neuronal networks is essential for intact cognitive and olfactory functions, respectively. Purinergic signaling modulates adult neurogenesis, however, the role of individual purinergic receptor subtypes in this dynamic process and related cognitive performance is poorly understood. In this study, we analyzed the role of P2Y2 receptor in the neurogenic niches and in related forebrain functions such as spatial working memory and olfaction using mice with a targeted deletion of the P2Y2 receptor (P2Y2−/−). Proliferation, migration, differentiation, and survival of neuronal precursor cells (NPCs) were analyzed by BrdU assay and immunohistochemistry; signal transduction pathway components were analyzed by immunoblot. In P2Y2−/− mice, proliferation of NPCs in the SGZ and the SVZ was reduced. However, migration, neuronal fate decision, and survival were not affected. Moreover, p-Akt expression was decreased in P2Y2−/− mice. P2Y2−/− mice showed an impaired performance in the Y-maze and a higher latency in the hidden food test. These data indicate that the P2Y2 receptor plays an important role in NPC proliferation as well as in hippocampus-dependent working memory and olfactory function."
https://openalex.org/W3151162868,"Objective While macroeconomic and environmental events affect the overall economic performance of nations, there has not been much research on the effects of important macroeconomic and environmental variables and how these can influence progress. Saudi Arabia’s economy relies heavily on its vast reserves of petroleum, natural gas, iron ore, gold, and copper, but its economic growth trajectory has been uneven since the 1990s. This study examines the effects of carbon emissions, rainfall, temperature, inflation, population, and unemployment on economic growth in Saudi Arabia. Methods Annual time series dataset covering the period 1990–2019 has been extracted from the World Bank and General Authority of Meteorology and Environmental Protection, Saudi Arabia. The Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) approach to cointegration has served to investigate the long-run relationships among the variables. Several time-series diagnostic tests have been conducted on the long-term ARDL model to check its robustness. Results Saudi Arabia can still achieve higher economic growth without effectively addressing its unemployment problem as both the variables are found to be highly significantly but positively cointegrated in the long-run ARDL model. While the variable of carbon emissions demonstrated a negative effect on the nation’s economic growth, the variables of rainfall and temperate were to some extent cointegrated into the nation’s economic growth in negative and positive ways, respectively. Like most other nations the short-run effects of inflation and population on economic growth do vary, but their long-term effects on the same are found to be positive. Conclusions Saudi Arabia can achieve both higher economic growth and lower carbon emissions simultaneously even without effectively addressing the unemployment problem. The nation should utilize modern scientific technologies to annual rainfall losses and to reduce annual temperature in some parts of the country in order to achieve higher economic growth."

However, little is known yet about the accuracy and relevance of web-based information for measuring innovation. In this study, we use data on 4,487 firms from the Mannheim Innovation Panel (MIP) 2019, the German contribution to the European Community Innovation Survey (CIS), to analyze which website characteristics perform as predictors of innovation activity at the firm level. Website characteristics are measured by several data mining methods and are used as features in different Random Forest classification models that are compared against each other. Our results show that the most relevant website characteristics are textual content, the use of English language, the number of subpages and the amount of characters on a website. In our main analysis, models using all website characteristics jointly yield AUC values of up to 0.75 and increase accuracy scores by up to 18 percentage points compared to a baseline prediction based on the sample mean. Moreover, predictions with website characteristics significantly differ from baseline predictions according to a McNemar test. Results also indicate a better performance for the prediction of product innovators and firms with innovation expenditures than for the prediction of process innovators."
https://openalex.org/W3144944433,"The neurotransmitter:sodium symporter (NSS) homolog LeuT from Aquifex aeolicus has proven to be a valuable model for studying the transport mechanism of the NSS family. Crystal structures have captured LeuT in key conformations visited during the transport cycle, allowing for the construction of a nearly complete model of transport, with much of the conformational dynamics studied by computational simulations. Here, we report crystal structures of LeuT representing new intermediate conformations between the outward-facing open and occluded states. These structures, combined with binding and accessibility studies, reveal details of conformational dynamics that can follow substrate binding at the central substrate binding site (S1) of LeuT in outward-facing states, suggesting a potential competition for direction between the outward-open and outward-occluded states at this stage during substrate transport. Our structures further support an intimate interplay between the protonation state of Glu290 and binding of Na1 that may ultimately regulate the outward-open-to-occluded transition."
https://openalex.org/W3145773874,"In murine and bovine photoreceptors, guanylate cyclase–activating protein 2 (GCAP2) activates retinal guanylate cyclases (GCs) at low Ca2+ levels, thus contributing to the Ca2+/cGMP negative feedback on the cyclase together with its paralog guanylate cyclase–activating protein 1, which has the same function but different Ca2+ sensitivity. In humans, a GCAP2 missense mutation (G157R) has been associated with inherited retinal degeneration (IRD) via an unknown molecular mechanism. Here, we characterized the biochemical properties of human GCAP2 and the G157R variant, focusing on its dimerization and the Ca2+/Mg2+-binding processes in the presence or absence of N-terminal myristoylation. We found that human GCAP2 and its bovine/murine orthologs significantly differ in terms of oligomeric properties, cation binding, and GC regulation. Myristoylated GCAP2 endothermically binds up to 3 Mg2+ with high affinity and forms a compact dimer that may reversibly dissociate in the presence of Ca2+. Conversely, nonmyristoylated GCAP2 does not bind Mg2+ over the physiological range and remains as a monomer in the absence of Ca2+. Both myristoylated and nonmyristoylated GCAP2 bind Ca2+ with high affinity. At odds with guanylate cyclase–activating protein 1 and independently of myristoylation, human GCAP2 does not significantly activate retinal GC1 in a Ca2+-dependent fashion. The IRD-associated G157R variant is characterized by a partly misfolded, molten globule-like conformation with reduced affinity for cations and prone to form aggregates, likely mediated by hydrophobic interactions. Our findings suggest that GCAP2 might be mostly implicated in processes other than phototransduction in human photoreceptors and suggest a possible molecular mechanism for G157R-associated IRD.

The phototransduction cascade in vertebrates is finely regulated by the subtle changes in intracellular Ca2+, which follow the closure of cyclic nucleotide–gated (CNG) channels upon the light-induced activation of the 3′,5′- cGMP phosphodiesterase 6 (PDE) (1Koch K.W. Dell'Orco D. Protein and signaling networks in vertebrate photoreceptor cells.Front. Mol. Neurosci. 2015; 8: 67Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Guanylate cyclase–activating proteins (GCAPs) are among the neuronal calcium sensors (NCSs) that permit such fine regulation and tune the light sensitivity of rods and cones, thus contributing to shape their photoresponses (1Koch K.W. Dell'Orco D. Protein and signaling networks in vertebrate photoreceptor cells.Front. Mol. Neurosci. 2015; 8: 67Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 2Palczewski K. Polans A.S. Baehr W. Ames J.B. Ca(2+)-binding proteins in the retina: Structure, function, and the etiology of human visual diseases.Bioessays. 2000; 22: 337-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). The widely established function of GCAPs is the regulation of the membrane-bound guanylate cyclases (GCs) via a Ca2+-dependent feedback mechanism that renders the enzymatic activity dependent of intracellular [Ca2+] (3Koch K.W. Stryer L. Highly cooperative feedback control of retinal rod guanylate cyclase by calcium ions.Nature. 1988; 334: 64-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). GCAPs constitutively interact with their GC targets (4Hwang J.Y. Koch K.W.

In the low intracellular Ca2+ phase, when CNG channels are closed because of PDE-mediated cGMP depletion, GCAPs stimulate the production of cGMP. When cGMP levels are sufficiently high, CNG channels reopen, restoring the submicromolar Ca2+ levels typical of dark-adapted cells. Finally, GCAPs switch to a Ca2+-bound, GC-inhibiting state, bringing the catalytic activity down to or below the basal levels (1Koch K.W. Dell'Orco D.

The general fold is typical of the EF-hand domain pair family, where two globular domains (N- and C-terminal) made of two EF-hand motifs are flanked to each other. The three functional EF-hand motifs permit the binding of up to three cations, either Ca2+ or Mg2+, in the specific region defined by the helix-loop-helix motif (see Fig. 1A for a structural model of guanylate cyclase–activating protein 2 [GCAP2]). Up to three GCAPs isoforms have been discovered in mammal photoreceptors, and six to eight in teleost fish (11Palczewski K. Sokal I. Baehr W.

GCAP2, which has higher affinity for Ca2+, activates the GC later in time or at lower Ca2+ levels, thus shaping the recovery kinetics of the photoresponse in brighter light or after the peak amplitude under dim light conditions (7Koch K.W.

To evaluate the effect of myristoylation on structure–function properties of human GCAP2, we expressed and purified both myristoylated and nonmyristoylated variants and assessed the presence of the post-translational modification by MALDI-TOF MS. The theoretical molecular mass (MM) of nonmyristoylated GCAP2 (nmGCAP2), based on the canonical protein sequence (UniProt entry: Q9UMX6), is reported in Table S1, which also reports the predicted MM of the myristoylated variant (myristoylated GCAP2 [mGCAP2]) both without and with the Gly-to-Arg substitution (G157R). The difference in the main peaks detected by MALDI-TOF spectra for mGCAP2 and nmGCAP2 (212.2 Da) is compatible with the effective myristoylation of the protein. Noticeably, no band ascribable to nmGCAP2 was visible in the mGCAP2 MALDI-TOF spectrum (Fig. 1B), thus pointing to a very efficient myristoylation process. The same analysis performed on the G157R variant showed in a peak at 23.7 kDa (Fig. 1D), compatible with a Gly-to-Arg mutation and successful myristoylation, as judged by the substantial correspondence between measured peaks and theoretical values (Table S1). Interestingly, MALDI-TOF spectra showed the presence of dimeric forms in samples of all variants (Fig. 1, B–D and Table S1). NCS proteins are characterized by heterogeneous oligomeric states (23Ames J.B. Dimerization of neuronal calcium sensor proteins.Front. Mol. Neurosci. 2018; 11: 397Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar), and it has been reported that the bovine GCAP2 undergoes Ca2+-dependent dimerization (46Olshevskaya E.V. Ermilov A.N. Dizhoor A.M.

Chem. 1999; 274: 25583-25587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). We investigated whether a similar behavior could be observed for its human ortholog. By performing analytical size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) in the presence of Mg2+ or Ca2+ on both myristoylated and nonmyristoylated forms, we assessed the effect of cation binding and the post-translational modification on the oligomeric state. The elution profiles of nmGCAP2 showed a main peak at 15.2 ml in the presence of Mg2+, which shifted to 14 ml in the concomitant presence of Ca2+ (Fig. 2A), thus resulting in an estimated MM of 25 and 58 kDa, respectively (see Experimental procedures). On the other hand, SEC profiles of mGCAP2 (Fig. 2B) displayed a cation-independent elution peak at 14.7 ml, corresponding to a MM of 35 kDa, which could be related to a different oligomeric state of the protein in Mg2+ or Ca2+ saturating conditions. Dynamic light scattering (DLS) conveniently allows measuring the change in the hydrodynamic diameter of calcium sensor proteins resulting from the structural rearrangement upon cation binding, as well as to evaluate any potential time-dependent aggregation propensity by monitoring the mean count rate (MCR) along the time. Results from DLS experiments showed an increase of the hydrodynamic diameter upon Ca2+ binding for both GCAP2 forms (Fig. 2, C and D), although to a different extent. Indeed, nmGCAP2 exhibited a 0.79-nm increase in the hydrodynamic diameter (6.71 versus 7.50 nm, Table 1, p-value < 0.001), whereas mGCAP2 displayed a 1.06-nm increase upon Ca2+ binding (6.02 versus 7.08 nm, Table 1, p-value < 0.001). Nevertheless, such increase in the hydrodynamic diameter can be ascribable to a conformational change rather than to an aggregation process, as shown by the stability of the MCR over the 90-min experimental time (Fig. S1). Interestingly, in the absence of cations, mGCAP2 displayed an abrupt increase in the MCR and wide oscillations around an approximately 40% higher value compared with the Mg2+ or Ca2+ saturating conditions, without evidence of aggregation trends (Fig. S1) at odds with nmGCAP2 that, in the apo-form, showed very stable and low MCR values, indicative of a particularly stable colloidal suspension. The same experiments performed with the IRD-associated G157R variant did not allow the estimation of the hydrodynamic diameter because of the high polydispersity index (0.44 ± 0.07 < polydispersity index <0.54 ± 0.08) of the colloidal suspension, indicative of a high tendency to rapidly form aggregates and/or of low protein stability.Table 1Hydrodynamic diameter estimation of GCAP2 variantsProteinStated ± σ (nm) [n]PdI ± σnmGCAP2Mg2+6.71 ± 0.08 [39]0.37 ± 0.08Mg2+ + Ca2+7.50 ± 0.15 [41]0.31 ± 0.04mGCAP2Mg2+6.02 ± 0.06 [55]0.28 ± 0.04Mg2+ + Ca2+7.08 ± 0.10 [38]0.30 ± 0.03d, hydrodynamic diameter; n, number of measurements; PdI, polydispersity index; σ, standard error.

To investigate the dimerization process of the physiologically relevant myristoylated form of GCAP2 in the presence of cations, the analytical SEC profiles of mGCAP2 were collected at an increasing protein concentration. In the presence of the physiological concentration of Mg2+, the elution peak displayed a minor shift of the apparent mass from 31.9 kDa at 5 μM mGCAP2 to 34.3 kDa at concentrations higher than 10 μM (Fig. 3A). On the other hand, in the presence of both Mg2+ and Ca2+, the main elution peak shifted compatibly with an increase of mass from 24 kDa (at 5 μM) to 33.8 kDa at 80-μM mGCAP2 (Fig. 3B), moreover, each peak displayed a shoulder at higher MM with the intensity proportional to the protein concentration. By fitting the apparent MM as a function of the mGCAP2 concentration to a hyperbolic curve (Fig. 3, inset), it was possible to obtain a cation-specific apparent KD of dimerization. Indeed, in the presence of Mg2+ mGCAP2 was found to dimerize with an apparent KD < 1 μM (R2= 0.89), thus suggesting that with physiological [Mg2+] in conditions of very low [Ca2+] mGCAP2 is a dimer. On the other hand, in the presence of both Mg2+ and Ca2+, the estimated apparent KD of dimerization shifted to 55.4 μM (R2= 0.99), thus pointing toward a Ca2+-dependent dimerization of mGCAP2. The same experiments performed on G157R showed that, despite having the same nominal concentration, all chromatographic profiles (Fig. S2) were considerably lower in intensity than the WT. Such decrease in absorbance pointed toward a massive cation-independent aggregation process, which would render the chromatograms collected at > 20 μM protein almost undetectable, in line with the behavior observed in DLS measurements. CD spectroscopy can be used to monitor the conformational changes of NCS proteins upon metal binding, by exploiting the differential absorption of circularly polarized light of the chiral centers of the protein. Specifically, the CD signal in the near UV (250–320 nm) arises from the microenvironment of aromatic residues, thus representing a fingerprint of the protein tertiary structure, whereas in the far UV (200–250 nm), the optically active peptide bonds provide information about the secondary structure elements. The near-UV CD spectrum of apo-nmGCAP2 (Fig. 4A, black trace) showed a relatively intense positive signal in all three bands corresponding to aromatic residues (Phe, Tyr, and Trp), indicating that the protein is significantly structured even in the a"
https://openalex.org/W3151287198,"TWIK-related acid-sensitive potassium channels (TASKs)-like current was recorded in orexin neurons in the lateral hypothalamus (LH), which are essential in respiratory chemoreflex. However, the specific mechanism responsible for the pH-sensitivity remains elusive. Thus, we hypothesized that TASKs contribute to respiratory chemoreflex. In the present study, we found that TASK1 and TASK3 were expressed in orexin neurons. Blocking TASKs or microinjecting acid artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF) in the LH stimulated breathing. In contrast, alkaline ACSF inhibited breathing, which was attenuated by blocking TASK1. Damage of orexin neurons attenuated the stimulatory effect on respiration caused by microinjection of acid ACSF (at a pH of 6.5) or TASKs antagonists. The orexinA-positive fiber and orexin type 1 receptor (OX1R) neurons were located in the nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS). The exciting effect of acidosis in the LH on respiration was inhibited by blocking OX1R of the NTS. Taken together, we conclude that orexin neurons sense the extracellular pH change through TASKs and regulate respiration by projecting to the NTS."
https://openalex.org/W3139764930,"The reduction of insulin resistance or improvement of insulin sensitivity is the most effective treatment for type 2 diabetes (T2D). We previously reported that Nogo-B receptor (NGBR), encoded by the NUS1 gene, is required for attenuating hepatic lipogenesis by blocking nuclear translocation of liver X receptor alpha, suggesting its important role in regulating hepatic lipid metabolism. Herein, we demonstrate that NGBR expression was decreased in the liver of obesity-associated T2D patients and db/db mice. NGBR knockout in mouse hepatocytes resulted in increased blood glucose, insulin resistance, and beta-cell loss. High-fat diet (HFD)/streptozotocin (STZ)-treated mice presented the T2D phenotype by showing increased nonesterified fatty acid (NEFA) and triglyceride (TG) in the liver and plasma and increased insulin resistance and beta-cell loss. AAV-mediated NGBR overexpression in the liver reduced NEFA and TG in the liver and circulation and improved liver functions. Consequently, HFD/STZ-treated mice with hepatic NGBR overexpression had increased insulin sensitivity and reduced beta-cell loss. Mechanistically, NGBR overexpression restored insulin signaling of AMPKα1-dependent phosphorylation of AKT and GSK3β. NGBR overexpression also reduced expression of endoplasmic reticulum stress-associated genes in the liver and skeletal muscle to improve insulin sensitivity. Together, our results reveal that NGBR is required to ameliorate T2D in mice, providing new insight into the role of hepatic NGBR in insulin sensitivity and T2D treatment.

Diabetes mellitus is a chronic, progressive disease characterized by elevated blood glucose levels. Blood glucose control, the objective of diabetes treatment, is important to reduce the progression of diabetic complications. The majority of patients with diabetes are affected by type 2 diabetes (T2D), which results from the body’s ineffective use of insulin (1Alberti K.G. Zimmet P.Z. Definition, diagnosis and classification of diabetes mellitus and its complications. Part 1: Diagnosis and classification of diabetes mellitus provisional report of a WHO consultation.Diabet. Med. 1998; 15: 539-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (9910) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is crucial for T2D to reduce insulin resistance or improve insulin sensitivity. The liver plays a central role in coordinating the whole-body metabolism. The increasing evidence suggests that hepatic insulin resistance is sufficient to induce several components of insulin resistance syndromes (2Meshkani R. Adeli K. Hepatic insulin resistance, metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular disease.Clin. Biochem. 2009; 42: 1331-1346Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is one of the most common chronic liver diseases. A strong association between lipid accumulation and T2D has been demonstrated (3Targher G. Lonardo A. Byrne C.D. Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and chronic vascular complications of diabetes mellitus.Nat. Rev. Endocrinol. 2018; 14: 99-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). More than 70% of T2D patients have NAFLD while almost all nonalcoholic steatohepatitis patients exhibit insulin resistance independently of bodyweight (4Chitturi S. Abeygunasekera S. Farrell G.C. Holmes-Walker J. Hui J.M. Fung C. Karim R. Lin R. Samarasinghe D. Liddle C. Weltman M. George J. NASH and insulin resistance: Insulin hypersecretion and specific association with the insulin resistance syndrome.Hepatology. 2002; 35: 373-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (967) Google Scholar), because the excessive hepatic lipid in turn enhances insulin resistance and evidence is growing that beta-cell function is impaired through lipotoxicity (5Tilg H. Moschen A.R. Roden M. NAFLD and diabetes mellitus.Nat. Rev. Gastroenterol. Hepatol. 2017; 14: 32-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). The reticulon-4 (RTN4), also known as neurite outgrowth inhibitor or Nogo, includes three isoforms (Nogo-A, B, C) by alternative promoter usage and splicing. NGBR was initially identified as a putative receptor for binding Nogo-B in endothelial cells, and binding of Nogo-B to NGBR can lead to endothelial cell proliferation/vascular remodeling and angiogenesis during development (6Miao R.Q. Gao Y. Harrison K.D. Prendergast J. Acevedo L.M. Yu J. Hu F. Strittmatter S.M. Sessa W.C. Identification of a receptor necessary for Nogo-B stimulated chemotaxis and morphogenesis of endothelial cells.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 10997-11002Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). NGBR is a transmembrane receptor that contains a conserved hydrophobic pocket, which regulates membrane localization of the prenylated protein. It also promotes the membrane accumulation of Ras by directly binding the prenylated Ras at the plasma membrane, resulting in promoting growth factors-stimulated tyrosine kinase pathways (7Zhao B. Hu W. Kumar S. Gonyo P. Rana U. Liu Z. Wang B. Duong W. Yang Z. Williams C. Miao Q. The Nogo-B receptor promotes Ras plasma membrane localization and activation.Oncogene. 2017; 36: 3406-3416Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Our previous study demonstrated that NGBR expression is decreased in human fatty liver tissue (8Hu W. Zhang W. Chen Y. Rana U. Teng R.J. Duan Y. Liu Z. Zhao B. Foeckler J. Weiler H. Kallinger R.E. Thomas M.J. Zhang K. Han J. Miao Q.R. Nogo-B receptor deficiency increases liver X receptor alpha nuclear translocation and hepatic lipogenesis through an adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase alpha-dependent pathway.Hepatology. 2016; 64: 1559-1576Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Consistently, NGBR deficiency in mouse liver results in remarkable lipid accumulation, indicating that loss of NGBR may be a potential trigger for inducing hepatic steatosis. Indeed, our study further demonstrated that NGBR deficiency impairs the activation of adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase alpha (AMPKα) and promotes the nuclear translocation of liver X receptor alpha (LXRα), a nuclear receptor of activating fatty acid synthesis. In contrast, activation of AMPKα by metformin, the first-line medicine used for T2D treatment, blocks NGBR deficiency-induced LXRα activation and hepatic lipid accumulation, suggesting that NGBR-AMPKα pathway is required for blocking LXRα nuclear translocation and LXRα-mediated lipogenesis (8Hu W. Zhang W. Chen Y. Rana U. Teng R.J. Duan Y. Liu Z. Zhao B. Foeckler J. Weiler H. Kallinger R.E. Thomas M.J. Zhang K. Han J. Miao Q.R. Nogo-B receptor deficiency increases liver X receptor alpha nuclear translocation and hepatic lipogenesis through an adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase alpha-dependent pathway.Hepatology. 2016; 64: 1559-1576Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). As shown in our previous study (8Hu W. Zhang W. Chen Y. Rana U. Teng R.J. Duan Y. Liu Z. Zhao B. Foeckler J. Weiler H. Kallinger R.E. Thomas M.J. Zhang K. Han J. Miao Q.R. Nogo-B receptor deficiency increases liver X receptor alpha nuclear translocation and hepatic lipogenesis through an adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase alpha-dependent pathway.Hepatology. 2016; 64: 1559-1576Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), NGBR hepatic-specific knockout mice have substantial increase of nonesterified fatty acid (NEFA) levels in the liver and plasma, which may affect insulin sensitivity. Herein, we further elucidated the pathophysiological role of NGBR in regulating insulin resistance in the context of T2D. To mimic the process of T2D in humans, we chose a mouse T2D model by high-fat diet (HFD) feeding and repeated injection of streptozotocin (STZ) at a low dose, which has been used in many studies (9Côté C. Rasmussen B. Duca F. Zadeh-Tahmasebi M. Baur J. Daljeet M. Breen D. Filippi B. Lam T. Resveratrol activates duodenal Sirt1 to reverse insulin resistance in rats through a neuronal network.Nat.

Hepatol. 2014; 60: 816-823Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In the early stage of T2D, the mass of beta cells expands, increasing insulin production to compensate for insulin insensitivity, which can be aggravated by HFD (11Mann J. Diet and risk of coronary heart disease and type 2 diabetes.Lancet. 2002; 360: 783-789Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Along with the development of T2D, the increased fatty acids in the beta cells can activate FOXO1, resulting in enhanced apoptosis of the beta cells (12Sun T. Han X. Death versus dedifferentiation: The molecular bases of beta cell mass reduction in type 2 diabetes.Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2020; 103: 76-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). STZ is a naturally occurring alkylating antineoplastic agent that is particularly toxic to the insulin-producing beta cells of the pancreas in mammals. However, such kind of the beta-cell loss caused by STZ in mice is severer than humans and consistent with what happens to patients with the advanced stage of T2D (13Marselli L. Suleiman M. Masini M. Campani D. Bugliani M. Syed F. Martino L. Focosi D. Scatena F. Olimpico F. Filipponi F. Masiello P. Boggi U. Marchetti P.

Pancreatic beta-cell mass in European subjects with type 2 diabetes.Diabetes Obes. Metab. 2008; 10 Suppl 4: 32-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar). Thus, repeated STZ injection plus HFD feeding has been suggested to be used for establishing the T2D animal model (9Côté C. Rasmussen B. Duca F. Zadeh-Tahmasebi M. Baur J. Daljeet M. Breen D. Filippi B. Lam T. Resveratrol activates duodenal Sirt1 to reverse insulin resistance in rats through a neuronal network.Nat.

Hepatol. 2014; 60: 816-823Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In this study, we used this T2D mouse model to determine the effects of NGBR overexpression on insulin resistance and demonstrated that liver NGBR could be required for maintaining insulin sensitivity and preventing T2D development. We searched the NCBI gene expression omnibus database (GEO access: GSE15653) and found that NGBR transcript level in the liver is decreased in obese-T2D patients as compared with non-T2D subjects (Fig. 1A). We further used quantitative real-time RT-PCR (qPCR) and western blot to determine NGBR transcript and protein levels in db/db mouse liver. Similarly, NGBR expression in db/db mouse liver is significantly decreased compared with normal controls (Fig. 1, B and C). These preliminary data suggest that NGBR may play an important role in T2D development. To test this hypothesis, we first examined the plasma glucose level in NGBR floxed littermate control (NGBRfl/fl) and NGBR hepatocyte-specific knockout (NGBRhepKO) mice under fasting conditions. As shown in Figure 1D, loss of NGBR expression in hepatocytes resulted in ∼40% increase in blood glucose level. Furthermore, glucose tolerance test (GTT) and insulin tolerance test (ITT) results revealed that severe insulin resistance occurred to NGBRhepKO mice (Fig. 1, E and F), the animals have hepatic steatosis due to activated LXRα-mediated fatty acid synthesis (8Hu W. Zhang W. Chen Y. Rana U. Teng R.J. Duan Y. Liu Z. Zhao B. Foeckler J. Weiler H. Kallinger R.E. Thomas M.J. Zhang K. Han J. Miao Q.R. Nogo-B receptor deficiency increases liver X receptor alpha nuclear translocation and hepatic lipogenesis through an adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase alpha-dependent pathway.Hepatology. 2016; 64: 1559-1576Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). With HFD feeding, NGBRhepKO mice showed increased bodyweight (Fig. 1G) and blood glucose levels (∼15.5 mM, Fig. 1H). The mice also showed decreased plasma insulin and C-peptide levels (Fig. 1I). Correspondingly, the decreased insulin-positive beta-cell mass was determined in the pancreases of NGBRhepKO mice (Fig. 1, J and K). Interestingly, NGBRhepKO mice also showed increased tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) and interleukin 1β (IL1β) mRNA levels in the liver (Fig. S1). These data strongly suggest that reduced NGBR expression in the liver may be one of the major contributors to the etiology of T2D by reducing insulin production and inducing chronic inflammation. Next, we used HFD/STZ mouse diabetes model to determine the effect of NGBR overexpression on insulin resistance. Mice were fed HFD for 4 weeks and then i.p. injected STZ for seven consecutive days. Seven days after the first STZ injection, blood glucose reached 15 mM. Two weeks later, mice with high blood glucose were further divided into two groups and i.v. injected empty adeno-associated virus (AAV9) vector (AAV9-GFP, this group was named as T2D group) or AAV9-carrying NGBR gene (AAV9-NGBR, this group was named as T2D+NGBR group), and continued HFD feeding for another 6 weeks (Fig. 2A). At the end of study, we found that NGBR expression in T2D mouse liver was moderately decreased (Fig. 2, B and C), which is consistent with the results in db/db mice (Fig. 1, B and C). It also implies the link between liver NGBR expression and T2D. Although Nogo-B has been considered as a putative ligand for NGBR binding, we determined that NGBR overexpression had little effect on Nogo-B expression in the liver (Fig. 2C). Reciprocally, NGBR deficiency had no effect on hepatic Nogo-B protein level and secretion in vitro and in vivo either (Fig. S2), indicating they might be independent molecules and have no interaction except in endothelial cells (6Miao R.Q. Gao Y. Harrison K.D. Prendergast J. Acevedo L.M. Yu J. Hu F. Strittmatter S.M. Sessa W.C.

Nogo-B receptor is essential for angiogenesis in zebrafish via Akt pathway.Blood. 2010; 116: 5423-5433Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In T2D group, the palpable color of liver (Fig. 2D) and the presence of vacuoles in H&E staining sections (Fig. 2E) were determined, indicating the HFD feeding results in severe lipid accumulation. The Oil Red O staining and Nile Red staining further confirm the increased lipid accumulation and lipid droplets formed in the liver of T2D group (Fig. 2, F and G). The levels of NEFA and triglyceride (TG) were significantly increased in the liver of T2D mice as compared with nondiabetic mice [negative control (NC) group: wild-type mice were fed standard chow] (left halves of Fig. 2, H and I). Compared with T2D group, infection of AAV9-NGBR substantially increased NGBR expression in the liver (Fig. 2, B and C). However, the levels of Ngbr mRNA in other tissues such as epididymal white adipose tissue (eWAT), skeletal muscle, and pancreas were not changed (Fig. S3), confirming the selective NGBR overexpression in the liver by AAV9-mediated gene delivery. Compared with NC group, STZ injection decreased mouse bodyweight but had little effect on food intake (Fig. S4). In addition, both bodyweight and food intake were similar between mice in T2D+NGBR and T2D groups during the treatment. Interestingly, high expressing NGBR reduced accumulation of NEFA and TG in the liver (Fig. 2, H and I), which were associated with reduced serum TG and NEFA levels (Table 1). The color of the liver of mice receiving AAV9-NGBR infection (T2D+NGBR group) was similar to that appeared in negative control group (NC) (Fig. 2D). The liver in T2D+NGBR group has reduced number of vacuoles with much smaller size in H&E staining, less lipid accumulation in Oil Red O staining, and fewer lipid droplets formed in Nile Red staining as compared with the liver in T2D group (Fig. 2, E–G). As shown in Table 1, HFD feeding increased levels of alkaline phosphatase (ALP), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and total bilirubin (TBIL), which are indicators of liver functional injuries. AAV9-mediated NGBR overexpression also improved liver functions by decreasing levels of AST, ALT, and TBIL. Mechanistically, AAV9-NGBR attenuated the HFD-induced expression of the genes involved in fatty acid synthesis, such as sterol regulatory element binding transcription factor 1 (Srebf1), acetyl-CoA carboxylase 1 (Acc1), and fatty acid synthase (Fasn); and the genes for TG synthesis, such as glycerol kinase (Gk) and diacylglycerol acyltransferase (Dgat) (Fig. 2J). These data further demonstrate that NGBR expression in the liver is essential for attenuating hepatic steatosis.Table 1High expressing NGBR ameliorates diabetes-induced metabolic disordersParameterGroupNCT2DT2D+NGBRTriglyceride (TG) (mM)1.43 ± 0.323.24 ± 0.8ap < 0.05 versus NC.2.23 ± 0.46bp < 0.05 versus T2D.Nonesterified fatty acid (NEFA) (μM)341.14 ± 83.12863.56 ± 430.5ap < 0.05 versus NC.598.78 ± 150.89bp < 0.05 versus T2D.Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) (U/l)57.97 ± 7.8686.5 ± 15.2182.68 ± 5.48Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (U/l)175.91 ± 23.3343.89 ± 74.58ap < 0.05 versus NC.231.63 ± 13.2bp < 0.05 versus T2D.Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (U/l)36.17 ± 4.26207.98 ± 65.23ap < 0.05 versus NC.123.46 ± 15.26bp < 0.05 versus T2D.Total bilirubin (TBIL) (μM)1.13 ± 0.22.14 ± 0.46ap < 0.05 versus NC.1.28 ± 0.51bp < 0.05 versus T2D.Blood urea nitrogen (BUN) (mM)8.06 ± 0.487.27 ± 0.586.54 ± 0.49At the end of treatment as indicated in Figure 2A, mouse serum samples were prepared and used to complete biochemical analysis.

Data are expressed as mean ± SD (n = 5, NC group; n = 7 for other two groups). Meanwhile, we determined the effects of NGBR overexpression on glucose homeostasis and insulin sensitivity in the liver. T2D is associated with high fasting plasma glucose and insulin levels. Indeed, compared with nondiabetic mice (NC group), levels of fasting serum insulin, C-peptide, and glucose were significantly increased in T2D group (Fig. 3, A–C). In contrast, NGBR overexpression in the liver substantially reduced them (Fig. 3, A–C). To further assess the effects of NGBR overexpression on whole-body glucose homeostasis and insulin resistance, we performed ITT and GTT. Compared with T2D group, we observed decreases in blood glucose levels 30 min after glucose injection (for ITT) and 30 to 60 min after insulin injection (for GTT), as well as AUC for glucose in T2D+NGBR group, which may reflect an increase in insulin sensitivity in mouse liver by NGBR overexpression (Fig. 3, D and E). Taken together, the results in Figure 3, A–E suggest that AAV-mediated NGBR overexpression in the liver ameliorates HFD/STZ-induced glucose intolerance and insulin resistance. As shown in Figure 1, J and K, lack of NGBR expression in the liver reduced insulin-positive beta-cell mass in mouse pancreas. Accordingly, we examined whether hepatic NGBR overexpression can protect islet against damage or beta-cell loss occurring to the diabetic animal model. Compared with nondiabetic mice, the results of glucagon and insulin immunofluorescent staining in Figure 3F demonstrated reduced islet size and increased pancreatic alpha cells in pancreases of diabetic mice, indicating severe damage to islets occurs. However, NGBR overexpression prevented reduction of islets size, loss of beta cells, and infiltration of alpha cells (Fig. 3F). In addition, the number of apoptotic beta cells determined by TUNEL staining was decreased in T2D+NGBR group (Fig. 3F), indicating that hepatic NGBR overexpression can also protect against beta-cell apoptosis in T2D. As a negative regulator of hepatic fatty acid synthesis (8Hu W. Zhang W. Chen Y. Rana U. Teng R.J. Duan Y. Liu Z. Zhao B. Foeckler J. Weiler H. Kallinger R.E. Thomas M.J. Zhang K. Han J. Miao Q.R. Nogo-B receptor deficiency increases liver X receptor alpha nuclear translocation and hepatic lipogenesis through an adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase alpha-dependent pathway.Hepatology. 2016; 64: 1559-1576Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), NGBR overexpression in the liver may contribute to improved beta cells by reducing circulating NEFA levels. Insulin activates insulin receptors mainly by activating AKT/PKB and PKCζ cascades (16Cheng Z. Tseng Y. White M.F. Insulin signaling meets mitochondria in metabolism.Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 2010; 21: 589-598Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar, 17Guo S. Insulin signaling, resistance, and the metabolic syndrome: Insights from mouse models into disease mechanisms.J. Endocrinol. 2014; 220: T1-T23Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Activated AKT induces glycogen synthesis through inhibition of GSK3β by phosphorylating it. To unveil the mechanisms by which NGBR enhances insulin sensitivity, we knocked down NGBR expression in HepG2 cells and primary hepatocytes by transfecting cells with NGBR siRNA and then treated cells with insulin. We found that reduced NGBR expression led to decreased phosphorylated AKT (p-AKT) at the basal level in HepG2 cells (Fig. 4A, lane 4 versus 1), and primary hepatocytes isolated from wild-type mice (Fig. S5). Furthermore, we found the insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of AKT and GSK3β (p-GSK3β) were also decreased in siNGBR-transfected cells (Fig. 4A, lane 2/3 versus 5/6, respectively), indicating that NGBR should be involved in regulating insulin sensitivity. To investigate if NGBR also affects insulin sensitivity in the insulin-resistant state, we treated cells with glucosamine hydrochloride (Glcn), a precursor of the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway (HBP), which can mimic the high-glucose-induced insulin resistance at the cellular level (18Pirola L. Johnston A.M. Van Obberghen E. Modulation of insulin action.Diabetologia. 2004; 47: 170-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar, 19Rossetti L. Hawkins M. Chen W. Gindi J. Barzilai N.

Signal. 2016; 28: 384-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). After Glcn treatment, phosphorylation of AKT was decreased (Fig. 4B, lane 4 versus 1), which was reversed by NGBR overexpression (Fig. 4B, lane 7 versus 4 and 1). In addition, the effects of insulin on induction of phosphorylation of AKT or GSK3β were impaired by Glcn (Fig. 4B, lane 5 or 6 versus 2 or 3), and the Glcn-caused impairment was blocked by NGBR overexpression (Fig. 4B, lane 8 or 9 versus 5 or 6). AMPK is an important sensor for cellular energy balance by regulating a wide array of physiological events including hyperglycemia and insulin sensitivity (21Ruderman N.B. Carling D. Prentki M. Cacicedo J.M. AMPK, insulin resistance, and the metabolic syndrome.J. Clin. Invest. 2013; 123: 2764-2772Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar). To further assess the role of AMPK in NGBR-improved insulin sensitivity, we established an AMPKα1 knockout (AMPKα1−/−) HepG2 cell line and determined that AMPKα1 knockout decreased phosphorylation of AMPK target genes, such as ACC and Raptor (Fig. S6A). We also found that insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of AKT or GSK3β was decreased in AMPKα1−/− HepG2 cells. Inhibition of NGBR expression by siRNA further reduced both p-AKT and p-GSK3β (Fig. 4C), as well as p-AMPKα1 and p-IRS1 (Fig. S6B). Next, we investigated the effect of NGBR overexpression on Glcn-impaired insulin signaling in both control and AMPKα1−/− HepG2 cells. In the insulin-treated HepG2 control cells, NGBR overexpression restored Glcn-impaired p-AKT (left halves, Fig. 4D). In contrast, NGBR overexpression cannot restore Glcn-impaired p-AKT in insulin-treated AMPKα1−/− HepG2 cells. These results suggest that NGBR regulates insulin signaling via AMPKα1. mTOR (mechanistic target of rapamycin) is a key mediator of the insulin signaling pathway (22Inoki K. Kim J. Guan K. AMPK and mTOR in cellular energy homeostasis and drug targets.Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2012; 52: 381-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar). We found that reduced NGBR expression led to increase of mTOR phosphorylation in HepG2 cells with or without insulin treatment (Fig. 4E). Reciprocally, NGBR overexpression reduced mTOR phosphorylation (Fig. 4F). These results suggest that reduced mTOR phosphorylation may contribute to NGBR-enhanced insulin signaling. Glcn- or high-glucose-induced ER stress contributes to insulin resistance (23Sakai K. Clemmons D.R. Glucosamine induces resistance to insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) and insulin in Hep G2 cell cultures: Biological significance of IGF-I/insulin hybrid receptors.Endocrinology. 2003; 144: 2388-2395Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 24Wallis M.G.

To investigate the role of NGBR in regulating ER stress, we first knocked down NGBR expression in HepG2 cells by NGBR siRNA and determined the effect of reduced NGBR on expression of ER stress-related genes. NGBR knockdown substantially increased mRNA and protein levels of binding immunoglobulin protein (BIP) (Fig. 5, A and C) as well as mRNA of DNA-damage inducible transcript 3 (CHOP) (Fig. 5C), indicating that reduction of NGBR expression may cause unfolded protein response (UPR). UPR is initiated by three ER transmembrane proteins: inositol-requiring enzyme 1α (IRE1α), pancreatic endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK), and activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6) (25Wang S.

Signal integration in the endoplasmic reticulum unfolded protein response.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 8: 519-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (4567) Google Scholar). We found that PERK protein (Fig. 5A) and mRNA of IRE1α and ATF6 were increased in NGBR knockdown HepG2 cells (Fig. 5C). The IRE1α RNase can excise a 26-nt intron from X-box binding protein 1 (XBP1) mRNA, which is then translated into XBP1s protein (27Yoshida H. Matsui T. Yamamoto A. Okada T. Mori K.

However, the specific pathways involved have long remained unexplored. Recent research demonstrated a growth advantage in certain organisms by using 5dAdo or intermediates as a sole carbon source and elucidated the corresponding salvage pathway. We now provide evidence using supernatant analysis by GC–MS for another 5dAdo recycling route. Specifically, in the unicellular cyanobacterium Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942 (S. elongatus), the activity of promiscuous enzymes leads to the synthesis and excretion first of 5-deoxyribose and subsequently of 7-deoxysedoheptulose. 7-Deoxysedoheptulose is an unusual deoxy-sugar, which acts as an antimetabolite of the shikimate pathway, thereby exhibiting antimicrobial and herbicidal activity. This strategy enables organisms with small genomes and lacking canonical gene clusters for the synthesis of secondary metabolites, like S. elongatus, to produce antimicrobial compounds from primary metabolism and enzymatic promiscuity. Our findings challenge the view of bioactive molecules as sole products of secondary metabolite gene clusters and expand the range of compounds that microorganisms can deploy to compete for their ecological niche. 5-Deoxyadenosine (5dAdo) is the byproduct of many radical S-adenosyl-l-methionine enzyme reactions in all domains of life. 5dAdo is also an inhibitor of the radical S-adenosyl-l-methionine enzymes themselves, making it necessary for cells to construct pathways to recycle or dispose of this toxic metabolite.

S-Adenosyl-l-methionine (SAM; AdoMet), which is formed by ATP and the amino acid methionine, is an essential cofactor of various enzymatic reactions in all domains of life. SAM can serve as a methyl group donor for the methylation of DNA, RNA, and proteins in reactions that release S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH) as a byproduct (1Fontecave M. Atta M. Mulliez E. S-adenosylmethionine: Nothing goes to waste.Trends Biochem. Sci. 2004; 29: 243-249Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). SAM can also serve as an aminopropyl donor for polyamine synthesis and as a homoserine lactone donor for the synthesis of quorum-sensing compound N-acetylhomoserine lactone, both of which result in the release of 5-methylthioadenosine (MTA). Furthermore, SAM is a source of the 5-deoxyadenosylradical (5dAdo•), which is formed by the activity of radical SAM enzymes (1Fontecave M. Atta M. Mulliez E.

They are catalyzing various complex chemical reactions, including sulfur insertion, anaerobic oxidations, unusual methylations, and ring formations (8Parveen N. Cornell K.A. Methylthioadenosine/S-adenosylhomocysteine nucleosidase, a critical enzyme for bacterial metabolism.Mol. Microbiol. 2011; 79: 7-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar).

Other members are involved in DNA repair or in the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites, for example, antibiotics (3Wang S.C. Frey P.A.

Therefore, and because of the high bioenergetic costs of these compounds, salvage pathways are necessary. SAH is rescued via the methionine cycle (13North J.A. Wildenthal J.A. Erb T.J. Evans B.S. Byerly K.M. Gerlt J.A. Tabita F.R. A bifunctional salvage pathway for two distinct S-adenosylmethionine by-products that is widespread in bacteria, including pathogenic Escherichia coli.Mol. Microbiol. 2020; 113: 923-937Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). MTA salvage via the methionine salvage pathway (MSP) is also well characterized (14Wray J.W. Abeles R.H.

Chem. 1995; 270: 3147-3153Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 15Sekowska A. Danchin A. The methionine salvage pathway in Bacillus subtilis.BMC Microbiol. 2002; 2: 8Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1B). In the classical and aerobic MSP, MTA is either processed by a two-step reaction by the MTA nucleosidase (MtnN), followed by a phosphorylation by the methylthioribose (MTR) kinase or by the MTA phosphorylase (MtnP). The subsequent reactions consist of a dehydration (MtnB, methylthioribose-1-phosphate [MTR-1P] dehydratase), enolization and phosphorylation (either by MtnC: DK-MTP-1P enolase/phosphatase or by MtnW: DK-MTP-1P enolase and MtnX: HK-MTPene-1P phosphatase; DK-MTP-1P: 2,3-diketo-5-methylthiopentyl-1-phosphate, HK-MTPene-1P: 2-hydroxy-3-keto-5-methylthiopentenyl-1-phosphate), deoxygenation (MtnD: acireductone dioxygenase), and a final transamination step (MtnE: aminotransferase). Despite the high abundance of radical SAM enzymes and thereby of 5dAdo, less is known about 5dAdo salvage. In vitro experiments showed that 5dAdo can be processed by a two-step reaction, in which 5dAdo is cleaved by promiscuous MtnN resulting in the release of adenine and 5-deoxyribose (5dR) (9Choi-Rhee E. Cronan J.E. A nucleosidase required for in vivo function of the S-Adenosyl-ʟ-Methionine radical enzyme, biotin synthase.Chem. Biol. 2005; 12: 589-593Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 10Challand M.R. Ziegert T. Douglas P. Wood R.J. Kriek M. Shaw N.M. Roach P.L. Product inhibition in the radical S-adenosylmethionine family.FEBS Lett. 2009; 583: 1358-1362Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The subsequent phosphorylation of 5dR by MTR kinase results in the formation of 5-deoxyribose 1-phosphate (5dR-1P). The second option is the direct conversion of 5dAdo into 5dR-1P and adenine via promiscuous MtnP (16Savarese T.M. Crabtree G.W. Parks R.E. 5′-methylthioadenosine phosphorylase—I. Substrate activity of 5′-deoxyadenosine with the enzyme from Sarcoma 180 cells.Biochem. Pharmacol. 1981; 30: 189-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is suggested that 5dAdo salvage is paralogous to the MSP and is driven by the promiscuous activity of the enzymes of the MSP (17Sekowska A. Ashida H. Danchin A. Revisiting the methionine salvage pathway and its paralogues.Microb. Biotechnol. 2018; 12: 77-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Recently, a pathway for 5dR salvage was elucidated in Bacillus thuringiensis involving the sequential activity of a kinase, an isomerase, and a class II aldolase, which are encoded by a specific gene cluster (18Beaudoin G.A.W. Li Q. Folz J. Fiehn O. Goodsell J.L. Angerhofer A. Bruner S.D. Hanson A.D. Salvage of the 5-deoxyribose byproduct of radical SAM enzymes.Nat. Commun. 2018; 9: 3105Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The authors propose that 5dR is phosphorylated to 5dR-1P, which is then isomerized into 5-deoxyribulose 1-phosphate (5dRu-1P) and subsequently cleaved by an aldolase into acetaldehyde and dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP) for primary metabolism. In organisms that lack the specific gene cluster, the cleavage of 5dAdo into DHAP and acetaldehyde is proposed to occur via the promiscuous activity of enzymes of the MSP. In support of this hypothesis, it was shown that Arabidopsis thaliana DEP1, an MTR-1P dehydratase of the MSP, is promiscuous and can also cleave 5dRu-1P into DHAP and acetaldehyde, suggesting that a specific aldolase is not required for 5dAdo salvage (18Beaudoin G.A.W. Li Q. Folz J. Fiehn O. Goodsell J.L. Angerhofer A. Bruner S.D. Hanson A.D. Salvage of the 5-deoxyribose byproduct of radical SAM enzymes.Nat. Commun. 2018; 9: 3105Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). In agreement with this, the promiscuous activity of MSP enzymes in the 5dAdo salvage was recently reported in Methanocaldococcus jannaschii (M. jannaschii), where methylthioribose 1-phosphate isomerase uses MTR-1P, 5dR-1P, and 5dR as substrates (19Miller D.V. Rauch B.J. Harich K. Xu H. Perona J.J. White R.H. Promiscuity of methionine salvage pathway enzymes in Methanocaldococcus jannaschii.Microbiology. 2018; 164: 969-981Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Only recently, 5dAdo was shown to be processed to DHAP and acetaldehyde by a gene cluster consisting of the first enzymes of the MSP as well as a class II aldolase in Rhodospirillum rubrum and pathogenic Escherichia coli strains, in a process termed “DHAP shunt” (13North J.A. Wildenthal J.A. Erb T.J. Evans B.S. Byerly K.M. Gerlt J.A. Tabita F.R.

In our previous work, we isolated the rare deoxy-sugar—namely, 7-deoxysedoheptulose (7-deoxy-d-altro-2-heptulose, 7-deoxy-sedoheptulose [7dSh])—from the supernatant of the unicellular cyanobacterium Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942 (S. elongatus) (20Brilisauer K.

Cyanobacterial antimetabolite 7-deoxy-sedoheptulose blocks the shikimate pathway to inhibit the growth of prototrophic organisms.Nat. Commun. 2019; 10: 545Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). This compound showed bioactivity toward various prototrophic organisms, for example, other cyanobacteria, especially Anabaena variabilis American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) 29413 (A. variabilis), Saccharomyces, and Arabidopsis. It blocks the shikimate pathway presumably by inhibiting the enzyme dehydroquinate synthase (20Brilisauer K. Rapp J. Rath P. Schöllhorn A. Bleul L. Weiß E. Stahl M. Grond S. Forchhammer K.

Because of the streamlined genome of S. elongatus and the lack of specific gene clusters for secondary metabolite synthesis (21Shih P.M. Wu D. Latifi A. Axen S.D. Fewer D.P. Talla E. Calteau A. Cai F. Tandeau de Marsac N. Rippka R. Herdman M. Sivonen K. Coursin T. Laurent T. Goodwin L. et al.Improving the coverage of the cyanobacterial phylum using diversity-driven genome sequencing.Proc.

National Library of Medicine (US), National Center for Biotechnology Information, Bethesda, MD2014Google Scholar), the pathway for 7dSh formation remained enigmatic. Of note, 7dSh was also isolated from the supernatant of Streptomyces setonensis (20Brilisauer K. Rapp J. Rath P. Schöllhorn A. Bleul L. Weiß E. Stahl M. Grond S. Forchhammer K. Cyanobacterial antimetabolite 7-deoxy-sedoheptulose blocks the shikimate pathway to inhibit the growth of prototrophic organisms.Nat.

Res. 1971; 17: 375-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), but the synthesis pathway remained unresolved. Therefore, we speculated that 7dSh synthesis might involve promiscuous enzymes of primary metabolism. Enzyme promiscuity, the ability of an enzyme to use various substrates, is especially important for organisms with a small genome. Previously, it was described that the marine cyanobacterium Prochlorococcus uses a single promiscuous enzyme that can transform up to 29 different ribosomally synthesized peptides into an arsenal of polycyclic bioactive products (24Li B. Sher D. Kelly L. Shi Y. Huang K. Knerr P.J. Joewono I. Rusch D. Chisholm S.W. van der Donk W.A.

A. 2010; 107: 10430-10435Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). As from the 7dSh-containing supernatant of S. elongatus, we in addition isolated the deoxy-sugar 5dR. We hypothesized that 5dR could serve as a precursor molecule of 7dSh (20Brilisauer K. Rapp J. Rath P. Schöllhorn A. Bleul L. Weiß E. Stahl M. Grond S. Forchhammer K. Cyanobacterial antimetabolite 7-deoxy-sedoheptulose blocks the shikimate pathway to inhibit the growth of prototrophic organisms.Nat. Commun. 2019; 10: 545Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In vitro, 5dR can serve as a substrate for a transketolase-based reaction, in which a C2 unit is transferred to the C5 unit leading to the formation of 7dSh (20Brilisauer K. Rapp J. Rath P. Schöllhorn A. Bleul L. Weiß E. Stahl M. Grond S. Forchhammer K. Cyanobacterial antimetabolite 7-deoxy-sedoheptulose blocks the shikimate pathway to inhibit the growth of prototrophic organisms.Nat. Commun. 2019; 10: 545Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In this work, we identified the pathway for 7dSh biosynthesis, which involves a new salvage route for 5dAdo resulting in the release of 5dR and 7dSh into the culture medium (Fig. 1A). Therefore, S. elongatus can synthesize a bioactive compound from the products of the primary metabolism simply by using promiscuous enzymes. Previously, we estimated the content of 7dSh in the supernatant of S. elongatus cultures via a bioassay based on the size of the inhibition zone of A. variabilis exposed to the supernatant of S. elongatus (20Brilisauer K. Rapp J. Rath P. Schöllhorn A. Bleul L. Weiß E. Stahl M. Grond S. Forchhammer K. Cyanobacterial antimetabolite 7-deoxy-sedoheptulose blocks the shikimate pathway to inhibit the growth of prototrophic organisms.Nat. Commun. 2019; 10: 545Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). To quantify the amounts of 5dR and 7dSh formed by S. elongatus, we developed a GC–MS–based method that enables the detection and absolute quantification of low micromolar concentrations of these metabolites in the culture supernatant. In cultures supplemented with 2% CO2 (Fig. 2, black dots), 5dR gradually accumulated during growth (Fig. 2, A and B), whereas 7dSh accumulation only occurred during a later growth phase (Fig. 2C). After 30 days of cultivation, the supernatant contained four times more 5dR than 7dSh. Under ambient air conditions (Fig. 2, gray squares), small amounts of 5dR were formed, whereas 7dSh could not be detected (Fig. 2, B and C), despite that the optical density of the air-supplied cultures in the final stage of the experiment reached values similar to those of the CO2-supplemented cultures, where 7dSh accumulation could be detected (Fig. 2A). This suggests that the formation of the deoxy-sugars is not only growth phase dependent but also related to a specific metabolic state. To gain further insights into 5dR/7dSh metabolism, we measured the intracellular concentration of 5dR and 7dSh over the whole cultivation process. Surprisingly, only small intracellular amounts, close to detection limit of either deoxy-sugar, could be detected (Fig. S1), whereas the extracellular concentration gradually increased. This strongly suggests that extracellular 5dR/7dSh accumulation is not because of cell lysis but involves immediate secretion after their formation. Removal of these metabolites from the cytoplasm is probably essential for S. elongatus as both molecules showed growth inhibition toward the producer strain at elevated concentrations (Fig. 3). 7dSh is bactericidal at concentrations of 100 μM, whereas 5dR is bacteriostatic at concentrations of 250 μM. In our previous work, we reported the in vitro synthesis of 7dSh by converting 5dR into 7dSh by a transketolase-based reaction with hydroxypyruvate as a C2 unit donor (20Brilisauer K. Rapp J. Rath P. Schöllhorn A. Bleul L. Weiß E. Stahl M. Grond S. Forchhammer K. Cyanobacterial antimetabolite 7-deoxy-sedoheptulose blocks the shikimate pathway to inhibit the growth of prototrophic organisms.Nat. Commun. 2019; 10: 545Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). To determine whether 5dR might also be a precursor molecule for 7dSh in vivo, a 5dR-feeding experiment was performed (Fig. 4). To unambiguously distinguish the naturally formed and the supplemented 5dR, uniformly labeled [U-13C5]-5dR (13C5-5dR) was synthesized and added at a final concentration of 20 μM to S. elongatus cultures at the beginning of the cultivation. The concentration of labeled (Fig. 4, B and C), unlabeled, (Fig. 4, D and E), and the total amount of 5dR and 7dSh (Fig. 4, F and G) was determined by GC–MS at different time points over a period of 30 days. Neither the growth of S. elongatus nor the excretion of unlabeled and intracellular synthesized 5dR and 7dSh was affected by the addition of exogenous 13C5-5dR (Fig. 4, A, D, and E). We found that 13C5-5dR is taken up by the cultures as its concentration in the supernatant continuously decreased (Fig. 4B, gray squares). Already within 2 days, 13C5-7dSh could be detected in the supernatant of these cultures (Fig. 4C, gray squares), clearly proving that 13C5-7dSh was formed from the precursor molecule 13C5-5dR. However, only a small amount of exogenously added 13C5-5dR was converted into 7dSh. At the end of the experiment, 10% of the initially applied 13C5-5dR (20 μM) was converted into 13C5-7dSh (∼2 μM). Around 30% of 13C5-5dR remained in the supernatant (6.5 μM). The residual amount is assumed to be metabolized via (an)other pathway(s). Because unlabeled 5dR was excreted at the same time as 13C5-5dR was taken up (Fig. 4, B and D), 5dR must be imported and exported in parallel. Next, we asked the question where 5dR is derived from. This drew our attention to 5dAdo, a byproduct of radical SAM enzymes (3Wang S.C. Frey P.A. S-adenosylmethionine as an oxidant: The radical SAM superfamily.Trends Biochem. Sci. 2007; 32: 101-110Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The compound has to be removed because of its intracellular toxicity (9Choi-Rhee E. Cronan J.E.

Salvage of the 5-deoxyribose byproduct of radical SAM enzymes.Nat. Commun. 2018; 9: 3105Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1C). To prove that 7dSh is formed from 5dAdo salvage in S. elongatus, 5dAdo-feeding experiments were performed, and the supernatants were analyzed by GC–MS (Fig. 5). Notably, the growth of S. elongatus was not affected by supplementation with 5dAdo, which was taken up very quickly (Fig. 5, A and B). After 4 days, almost all 5dAdo was taken up. A control experiment showed that the rapid decline in the amount of 5dAdo in the supernatant was not caused by the instability of 5dAdo in the medium. Feeding of the cells with 5dAdo immediately led to an enhanced accumulation of 5dR in the culture supernatant (Fig. 5C). After 14 days, 7dSh levels in 5dAdo-supplemented cultures were clearly enhanced compared with control cultures (Fig. 5D), supporting our hypothesis that 5dAdo is a precursor molecule of 7dSh. However, only about half of the supplemented 5dAdo (initial concentration: 25 μM) was converted into 5dR and 7dSh: at the end of the experiment, the 5dR concentration in the supplemented cultures was increased by around 10 μM and that of 7dSh by 2 μM, suggesting additional pathway(s) for 5dAdo salvage. 5dAdo is known to be cleaved by either the MtnN or the MtnP (9Choi-Rhee E.

The former reaction leads to the release of adenine and 5dR, whereas the latter leads to phosphate-dependent release of adenine and 5dR-1P. In S. elongatus, no homologous gene for a MtnN was found, but gene Synpcc7942_0923 is annotated as a MtnP. Therefore, an insertion mutant was generated via the replacement of the gene by an antibiotic resistance cassette (S. elongatus mtnP::specR). Polar effects because of the insertion of the antibiotic resistance cassette were excluded by monitoring the expression of the genes with a semiquantitative RT-PCR (Fig. S2). Under conditions favorable for 5dR/7dSh production, the mutant grew like the wildtype (Fig. 6A). A GC–MS analysis of the culture supernatant revealed that the mutant neither excreted 5dR nor 7dSh (Fig. 6, C and D). Instead, while undetectable in the supernatant of the wildtype strain, 5dAdo strongly accumulated in the supernatant of S. elongatus mtnP::specR cultures (Fig. 6B). This confirmed that 5dR/7dSh are derived from 5dAdo in a MtnP-dependent manner. Because of the detoxification via excretion, the mtnP::specR mutant escapes the toxic effect of 5dAdo and does not show any growth disadvantage (Fig. 6A). It has previously been reported that a mtnP knockout mutant in Saccharomyces cerevisiae as well as MtnP-deficient mammalian tumor cells excreted MTA (25Chattopadhyay M.K. Tabor C.W. Tabor H.

Carson D.A. Abnormal regulation of methylthioadenosine and polyamine metabolism in methylthioadenosine phosphorylase-deficient human leukemic cell lines.Cancer Res. 1980; 40: 4178-4182PubMed Google Scholar). Both MTA and 5dAdo are known to be cleaved by MtnP (16Savarese T.M. Crabtree G.W. Parks R.E. 5′-methylthioadenosine phosphorylase—I. Substrate activity of 5′-deoxyadenosine with the enzyme from Sarcoma 180 cells.Biochem. Pharmacol. 1981; 30: 189-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Consistently, the mtnP::specR mutant excretes MTA as well as 5dAdo (Fig. 6E). Since 5dR/7dSh formation strongly depends on elevated CO2 conditions, we measured the amount of 5dAdo and MTA in cultures of the mtnP::specR mutant supplied with ambient air or with air enriched with 2% CO2. However, the amounts of excreted 5dAdo and MTA (normalized to the optical density of the cultures) were almost identical under both conditions (Fig. 6E). This clearly indicates that 5dAdo salvage via 5dR/7dSh formation and excretion at high CO2 conditions is not triggered by an increased synthesis of the precursor molecule 5dAdo compared with ambient CO2 concentrations. Rather, it appears that 5dAdo is actively metabolized into 5dR/7dSh under elevated CO2 conditions, whereas 5dAdo salvage under ambient CO2 conditions is conducted by (an)other pathway(s). Since the MTA formation is also unaltered (Fig. 6E), we conclude that 5dAdo salvage via 5dR/7dSh formation is not triggered by an enhanced demand of MTA salvage via the MSP pathway. To clarify how widespread the synthesis of 7dSh or 5dR is in cyanobacteria, we analyzed the supernatants of other cyanobacterial strains via GC–MS (Synechococcus sp. PCC 6301, Synechococcus sp. PCC 7002, Synechococcus sp. PCC 6312, Synechococcus sp. PCC 7502, Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803, A. variabilis ATCC 29413, Nostoc punctiforme ATCC 29133, and Anabaena sp. PCC 7120). Only in three of five Synechococcus strains, the deoxy-sugars 5dR and 7dSh were detectable. All the other strains accumulated neither 5dR nor 7dSh. In the freshwater strain Synechococcus sp. PCC 6301, the amounts of 7dSh and 5dR were in a similar concentration range to those in S. elongatus. This is not surprising since the genome of Synechococcus sp. PCC 6301 is nearly identical to that of S. elongatus PCC 7942 (27Sugita C. Ogata K. Shikata M. Jikuya H. Takano J. Furumichi M. Kanehisa M. Omata T. Sugiura M. Sugita M.

https://openalex.org/W3149656751,"Background Pre-existing chronic hypotension affects a percentage of kidney transplanted patients (KTs). Although a relationship with delayed graft function (DGF) has been hypothesized, available data are still scarce and inconclusive. Methods A monocentric retrospective observational study was performed on 1127 consecutive KTs from brain death donors over 11 years (2003–2013), classified according to their pre-transplant Mean Blood Pressure (MBP) as hypotensive (MBP &lt; 80 mmHg) or normal-hypertensive (MBP ≥ 80 mmHg, with or without effective antihypertensive therapy). Results Univariate analysis showed that a pre-existing hypotension is associated to DGF occurrence (p&lt;0.01; OR for KTs with MBP &lt; 80 mmHg, 4.5; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.7 to 7.5). Chronic hypotension remained a major predictive factor for DGF development in the logistic regression model adjusted for all DGF determinants. Adjunctive evaluations on paired grafts performed in two different recipients (one hypotensive and the other one normal-hypertensive) confirmed this assumption. Although graft survival was only associated with DGF but not with chronic hypotension in the overall population, stratification according to donor age revealed that death-censored graft survival was significantly lower in hypotensive patients who received a KT from &gt;50 years old donor. Conclusions Our findings suggest that pre-existing recipient hypotension, and the subsequent hypotension-related DGF, could be considered a significant detrimental factor, especially when elderly donors are involved in the transplant procedure."
https://openalex.org/W3151976741,"The adipocyte precursors (APs) located in white adipose tissue (WAT) are functionally significant in adipose plasticity and browning. Modifying adipogenesis or WAT browning targeted on APs is a promising mechanism for anti-obesity drug. We herein explored the in vitro actions and mechanisms of glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP), a gut-derived peptide, in human adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hADSCs) isolated from omentum. The hADSCs were cotreated with 100 nM GIP with or without equimolar concentration of GIP3-42 (a GIP receptor antagonist), and subsequently examined in vitro. CCK-8, EdU incorporation, and flow cytometry assays were used to assess cellular proliferation. Annexin V FTIC/PI double stain, TUNEL staining, and Western blot were applied for apoptosis evaluation. Adipogenesis was reflected by Western blot, real-time PCR, Oil Red O staining, mitochondrial staining, and mitochondrial DNA analysis. Results showed that GIP promoted proliferation and inhibited apoptosis of hADSCs via pleiotropic effects. Besides, GIP facilitated de novo beige adipogenesis, by accelerating mitotic clonal expansion (MCE), upregulating core adipogenic regulators (C/EBPα and PPARγ), augmenting beige-related genes (UCP1, PGC1α, and PRDM16), increasing mitochondrial content and improving beige adipocyte functionalities. Above all, our study expands knowledge on the mechanisms of GIP modifying adipogenesis especially in inducing beige adipogenesis, and thus provides a theoretical support for clinical usage of GIP on obesity treatment."
https://openalex.org/W3151437058,"Compared to conventional antisera strategies, monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) represent an alternative and safer way to treat botulism, a fatal flaccid paralysis due to botulinum neurotoxins (BoNTs). In addition, mAbs offer the advantage to be produced in a reproducible manner. We previously identified a unique and potent mouse mAb (TA12) targeting BoNT/A1 with high affinity and neutralizing activity. In this study, we characterized the molecular basis of TA12 neutralization by combining Hydrogen/Deuterium eXchange Mass Spectrometry (HDX-MS) with site-directed mutagenesis and functional studies. We found that TA12 recognizes a conformational epitope located at the interface between the HCN and HCC subdomains of the BoNT/A1 receptor-binding domain (HC ). The TA12-binding interface shares common structural features with the ciA-C2 VHH epitope and lies on the face opposite recognized by ciA-C2- and the CR1/CR2-neutralizing mAbs. The single substitution of N1006 was sufficient to affect TA12 binding to HC confirming the position of the epitope. We further uncovered that the TA12 epitope overlaps with the BoNT/A1-binding site for both the neuronal cell surface receptor synaptic vesicle glycoprotein 2 isoform C (SV2C) and the GT1b ganglioside. Hence, TA12 potently blocks the entry of BoNT/A1 into neurons by interfering simultaneously with the binding of SV2C and to a lower extent GT1b. Our study reveals the unique neutralization mechanism of TA12 and emphasizes on the potential of using single mAbs for the treatment of botulism type A."

The contraction and relaxation of striated muscles, i.e., cardiac and skeletal muscles, are regulated by Ca2+ via the troponin complex in sarcomeric myofilaments. Troponin consists of three protein subunits: the Ca2+-binding subunit troponin C (TnC), the inhibitory subunit troponin I (TnI), and the tropomyosin (Tm)-binding subunit troponin T (TnT) (1Gordon A.M.

Muscle contraction results from a rise of cytosolic Ca2+ that binds TnC to induce allosteric changes in TnC, TnI, TnT, and Tm, which allows the myosin heads to form strong cross-bridges with actin filament to activate myosin ATPase and generate power strokes and the shortening of sarcomeres (5Cooke R.

The data indicate that the C-terminal end segment of TnI is a regulatory element of troponin, which retains the native configuration and physiological effect on myofilament Ca2+-desensitization in the form of free peptide. Without negative inotropic impact, this short peptide may be developed into a novel reagent to selectively facilitate the relaxation of activated cardiac muscle for the treatment of diastolic dysfunction and heart failure. To establish the underlying mechanism, it is necessary to understand how free HcTnI-C27 peptide folds into functional structure. In the present study, we examined the conformational preferences of isolated HcTnI-C27 peptide in solution and the restrictive cardiomyopathic mutant HcTnI-C27-H (Arg192His) by using a combination of experimental and MD simulation approaches. The results demonstrate that both peptides populated a nascent-helix conformation, of which the amount of helical conformation was reduced in the mutant peptide that exhibits impaired physiological effect on Ca2+-sensitivity and contractility of cardiac muscle. HcTnI-C27 binds αTm with low-micromolar affinity, acquiring a helix-like conformation. With HcTnI-C27’s potent Ca2+-desensitization effect on skinned cardiac muscle from a mouse model of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, the data support that the C-terminal end domain of TnI can function in the form of isolated peptide to modify muscle contractility as a potential therapeutic reagent to improve diastolic function for the treatment of heart failure.

Open table in a new tab The far-UV CD spectra of HcTnI-C27 and HcTnI-C27-H peptides in aqueous solution both showed an intense band at 200 nm with a small shoulder at 222 nm, suggesting that they were mainly disordered (Fig. 2A). The presence of the 222 nm shoulder could be due to a population of turn- or helix-like structures and/or the existence of aromatic residues in the peptides (Trp191 and Phe208 in HcTnI-C27; and Trp191, His192, and Phe208 in HcTnI-C27-H), which also absorb at 222 nm (15Kelly S.M. Price N.C. The use of circular dichroism in the investigation of protein structure and function.Curr. Prot. Pept. Sci. 2000; 1: 349-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (741) Google Scholar, 16Woody R.W. Circular dichroism.Methods Enzymol. 1995; 246: 34-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar). While the possible interference of those residues is considered, the amount of helical structure in both peptides was estimated from the CD spectra by using two methods as follows. First, from the molar ellipticity at 222 nm, [Θ]222, we estimated the percentage of helical structure for the peptides assuming that the value of [Θ]222 for a fully formed helix is −39,500 deg cm2 dmol−1 (17Chen Y.H. Yang J.T. Chau K.H. Determination of the helix and β form of proteins in aqueous solution by circular dichroism.Biochemistry. 1974; 13: 3350-3359Crossref PubMed Scopus (1935) Google Scholar). The estimated values were 6.7% (−2669.8 deg cm2 dmol−1) for HcTnI-C27 and 4.6% (−1829.7 deg cm2 dmol−1) for HcTnI-C27-H (Fig. 2A). Spectral deconvolution using the DICHROWEB web page (18Whitmore L.

Wallace B.A. Protein secondary structure analyses from circular dichroism spectroscopy: methods and reference databases.Biopolymers. 2008; 89: 392-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (1625) Google Scholar) yielded a prediction of a very small population of helical structure in both peptides: 0.5% to 10%, depending on the algorithm used, for HcTnI-C27, and 0.4% to 6% for HcTnI-C27-H. Considering the possible interference of aromatic residues indicated above, these differences in the deconvolution of the spectra of both peptides, or in the helix estimation from the ellipticity at 222 nm, are taken with caution. And second, TFE titrations followed by CD were employed to estimate the equilibrium constant (K) for the disordered ↔ helical reaction (20Sancho J. Neira J.L. Fersht A.R. An N-terminal fragment of barnase has residual helical structure similar to that in a refolding intermediate.J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 224: 749-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 21Jasanoff A. Fersht A.R. Quantitative determination of helical propensities from trifluoroethanol titrations.Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 2129-2135Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar), assuming that there were no intermediates (as suggested by the presence of an isodichroic wavelength for each peptide titration). Unlike the above analyses, which make assumptions about how the ellipticity signal at 222 nm relates to secondary structure content, TFE titration allows the determination of helical content derived from the free-energy change of such equilibrium. The [Θ]222 increased in absolute value for both peptides as TFE concentration was raised (Fig. 2B). The titration for HcTnI-C27 was more cooperative than that for HcTnI-C27-H, with m-values of 42 ± 14 kcal/(mol %) and 117 ± 20 kcal/(mol %), respectively. However, the [TFE]1/2 (the midpoint of the transition in % (v/v)) did not differ significantly: 16 ± 8% for wild-type and 23 ± 2% for the mutant (Fig. 2B). These values yielded a 7.5% of helical population for HcTnI-C27 (K = 0.0818) and 1% for the mutant (K = 0.012). These findings suggested that the tendency to populate an α-helical structure was larger in the wild-type peptide. Additionally, we used AGADIR (22Muñoz V. Serrano L.

Biochem. 1997; 243: 384-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). The predictions (at 10 °C and pH 7.2) yielded very small percentages of helical structure (Fig. 2C) for both peptides: 1.43% for HcTnI-C27 and 0.82% for HcTnI-C27-H. It is important to note that these values indicate that the percentage of helical structure in both peptides was small as anticipated for short 27-residue-long peptides. However, the change of only one amino acid in the mutant produced notable difference in helicity (Fig. 2C). Therefore, the far-UV CD data indicate that both peptides weakly populated helix-like conformations, and such population was slightly higher in the wild-type peptide than in the myopathic mutant. We carried out homonuclear 2D-1H-NMR experiments to determine the presence of the helix-like conformations. The peptides were mainly disordered in aqueous solution, but there were residual conformations as shown by two pieces of evidence. First, no long- or medium-range NOEs were detected (Fig. 3), but sequential NN(i, i + 1) NOEs (and ROEs) were observed for residues around Trp191 and Ile195 in the HcTnI-C27 peptide (Fig. 3A), with most of these NOEs not being present in HcTnI-C27-H (Fig. 3B). These contacts indicate the presence of a nascent helix, although it was not very stable, as shown by the absence of protected amide protons of the peptides in the presence of D2O (hydrogen/exchange experiments) (Fig. S1). And second, the sequence-corrected conformational shifts (28Wüthrich K. NMR of Proteins and Nucleic Acids. John Wiley and Sons, New York, NY1986Crossref Google Scholar, 29Schwarzinger S. Kroon G.J.

The 13C chemical shifts of the Cα and Cβ of the residues labeled (i.e., Arg186, Val188, Gly189, Arg192, Lys193, Ile195, Ala197, Leu198, Gly200, Gly203, Arg204, Lys205, Lys206, Lys207, and Phe208) were not very different from those reported for random-coil polypeptide chains (30Kjaergaard M. Poulsen F.M. Sequence correction of random coil chemical shifts: correlation between neighbor correction factors and changes in the Ramachandran distribution.J. Biomol. NMR. 2011; 50: 157-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) (Table S3). We performed NMR experiments in the presence of 50% TFE, when the titration of both peptides had reached a plateau (Fig. 2B). Both the NOE pattern (presence of NN(i, i + 1), NN(i, i + 2), NN(i, i + 3), αN(i, i + 3), αN(i, i + 4), αβ(i, i + 3) contacts) (Fig. 3, C–D) and the conformational shifts of the Hα protons (Tables S2 and S4) indicate the presence of helix-like conformations between Trp191 and Gly200. This polypeptide patch involves the same region acquiring an α-helix (α5 helix) in the whole TnI-TnC-TnT2 complex (PDB accession number 1VDI) (31Murakami K. Yumoto F. Ohki S. Yasunaga T. Tanokura M.

Biol. 2005; 352: 178-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). It is important to note that the organic solvent does not induce helical structure, but it only enhances the population of this structure in those regions with an intrinsic tendency to acquire such type of conformation. To investigate whether different pH yielded a different NOE pattern in NMR experiments for the helicities of the two peptides, we also carried out experiments at pH 4.5 (Tables ST6 and ST7) for both peptides to test experimentally the qualitative predictions of AGADIR (22Muñoz V. Serrano L. Elucidating the folding problem of helical peptides using empirical parameters.Nat. Struct. Biol. 1994; 1: 399-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar, 23Lacroix E. Viguera A.R.

Biochem. 1997; 243: 384-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), which suggested a lower percentage of helical structure at this pH due to global electrostatic effects in the peptides: 1.00% for the wild-type peptide and 0.70% for the myopathic mutant. As seen at pH 7.0 described above, we observed that in HcTnI-C27 the sequential amide–amide NOEs between Val188-Gly189, Asp190-Trp191, Lys193-Asn194, Ile195-Asp196, Met201-Glu202, and Gly203-Arg204 were detected. On the other hand, for HcTnI-C27-H, only the amide–amide NOEs between Asn194-Ile195, Met201-Glu202, and Gly203-Arg204 were observed. Thus, the number of sequential NOEs, characteristic of a nascent helix, in both peptides at pH 4.5 was smaller than at physiological pH (Fig. 3). To further confirm the propensity of the peptides to populate helical conformations, we carried out MD simulations for 50 ns in explicit solvent using the water model TIP3P (32Jorgensen W.L. Chandrasekhar J. Madura J.D. Impey R.W. Klein M.L. Comparison of simple potential functions for simulating liquid water.J. Chem. Phys. 1983; 79: 926-935Crossref Scopus (26591) Google Scholar). The starting structures were built on the basis of the TnI-TnC-TnT2 complex (31Murakami K. Yumoto F. Ohki S. Yasunaga T. Tanokura M. Wakabayashi T. Structural basis for Ca2+-regulated muscle relaxation at interaction sites of troponin with actin and tropomyosin.J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 352: 178-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Figure 4 shows that in the structure of the wild-type peptide HcTnI-C27, the number of hydrogen bonds forming α-helical structure decreased from the initial number (about 13–15 hydrogen bonds), and after 25 ns equilibrated to a final value of 5. In contrast, the HcTnI-C27-H peptide was less stable and lost all its structure before the end of the simulation. This finding is a direct indication of a decreased helical propensity due to the Arg192His mutation (in agreement with the far-UV CD results, the TFE titration, the deconvolution of far-UV CD spectra, and the NMR results). Figure 5 reports in detail the type of secondary structure of the wild-type peptide obtained at equilibrium as a function of the residues. The results show that a residual α-helix was present starting at the Trp residue and extended up to the following four amino acid residues along the sequence.Figure 5Residues with secondary structure in HcTnI-C27 peptide. Details of the secondary structure obtained in simulation in the time window of 25 to 50 ns are shown as that when the number of hydrogen bonds involved in α-helical structures has reached a plateau (see Fig. 4). A persistent presence of α-helix is visible starting from residue Trp191.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The NMR and MD data conclude that, at residue level, isolated HcTnI-C27 had native helix-like structure in aqueous solution around Trp191 and a tendency to extend it into the following few residues. On the other hand, HcTnI-C27-H had a smaller population of helix-like structures and, thus, this mutation disrupted (although not fully) the structure around the aromatic moiety. We further tested the binding of HcTnI-C27 and HcTnI-C27-H peptides to Tm, a potential target of TnI’s inhibitory regulation of the activation and deactivation of myofilaments (11Zhang Z. Akhter S.

First, we monitored the binding by using far-UV CD measurements for the formation of complex of equimolar amounts of the corresponding peptide and protomer of tropomyosin. HcTnI-C27 showed small changes in the addition spectrum (obtained by the sum of the spectra of isolated αTm and HcTnI-C27) and that of the complex (Fig. 6A). On the other hand, HcTnI-C27-H s"

However, it is necessary to perform an optimisation study on the order picking to reduce the time cost as much as possible. According to the channel location information that needs to be sorted, the multiple orders are divided into different batches by using hierarchical clustering. On this basis, a mathematical model for the virtual order clusters formed in the batches is established to optimize the order cluster picking and rack position movement, with the minimum picking time as the objective. For this model, a hybrid genetic algorithm is designed, and the characteristics of the different examples and solution algorithms are further analysed to provide a reference for the solution of the order picking optimisation problem in a dense mobile rack warehouse."

Unlike bacterial Z rings, which consist of a single FtsZ, the chloroplast Z ring in plants is composed of two FtsZ proteins, FtsZ1 and FtsZ2. Both are required for chloroplast division in vivo, but their biochemical relationship is poorly understood. We used GTPase assays, light scattering, transmission electron microscopy, and sedimentation assays to investigate the assembly behavior of purified Arabidopsis thaliana (At) FtsZ1 and AtFtsZ2 both individually and together. Both proteins exhibited GTPase activity. AtFtsZ2 assembled relatively quickly, forming protofilament bundles that were exceptionally stable, as indicated by their sustained assembly and slow disassembly. AtFtsZ1 did not form detectable protofilaments on its own. When mixed with AtFtsZ2, AtFtsZ1 reduced the extent and rate of AtFtsZ2 assembly, consistent with its previously demonstrated ability to promote protofilament subunit turnover in living cells. Mixing the two FtsZ proteins did not increase the overall GTPase activity, indicating that the effect of AtFtsZ1 on AtFtsZ2 assembly was not due to a stimulation of GTPase activity. However, the GTPase activity of AtFtsZ1 was required to reduce AtFtsZ2 assembly. Truncated forms of AtFtsZ1 and AtFtsZ2 consisting of only their conserved core regions largely recapitulated the behaviors of the full-length proteins. Our in vitro findings provide evidence that FtsZ1 counterbalances the stability of FtsZ2 filaments in the regulation of chloroplast Z-ring dynamics and suggest that restraining FtsZ2 self-assembly is a critical function of FtsZ1 in chloroplasts.

Osteryoung K.W. Chloroplast FtsZ assembles into a contractible ring via tubulin-like heteropolymerization.Nat. Plants. 2016; 2: 16095Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but this has not been explored. Extensive in vitro investigation has revealed that the dynamics of bacterial FtsZ protofilaments is an emergent property of their GTPase activity. Such studies have demonstrated that FtsZ polymerization is GTP-dependent because GTP-bound monomers assemble onto a growing protofilament. However, the GTPase active site is formed in the longitudinal interface between two subunits. Therefore, GTP hydrolysis requires oligomerization (28Scheffers D.-J. de Wit J.G. den Blaauwen T.

Löwe J. Structural insights into FtsZ protofilament formation.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 1243-1250Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Hydrolysis weakens the interface and facilitates dissociation of GDP-bound subunits from protofilament ends. Following nucleotide exchange, subunits recycle back onto protofilaments (30Mukherjee A. Lutkenhaus J. Guanine nucleotide-dependent assembly of FtsZ into filaments.J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 2754-2758Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). Recent in vitro and modeling studies have explained how GTP hydrolysis, coupled with a conformational change in the FtsZ subunit, can lead to preferential loss of subunits from one end of the protofilament and addition onto the other end, producing treadmilling (19Ramirez-Diaz D.A. García-Soriano D.A. Raso A. Mücksch J. Feingold M. Rivas G. Schwille P.

Thus cycles of assembly and GTPase-dependent subunit dissociation drive emergent protofilament dynamics independently of any other proteins (11McQuillen R. Xiao J.

At the heart of bacterial cytokinesis: The Z ring.Trends Microbiol. 2019; 27: 781-791Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). However, because FtsZ is self-assembling, the formation of Z rings in both bacteria and chloroplasts is confined to the division site in vivo primarily by negative regulatory systems that hinder FtsZ assembly elsewhere (4Chen C. MacCready J.S. Ducat D.C. Osteryoung K.W. The molecular machinery of chloroplast division.Plant Physiol. 2018; 176: 138-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 31Monahan L.G. Liew A.T.F.

In vitro study of FtsZ proteins has therefore not only revealed their intrinsic self-assembly and dynamic properties, but has also been crucial for understanding the functions of the many factors that regulate Z-ring assembly and dynamics in vivo. Unlike bacterial Z rings, which are composed of a single FtsZ, chloroplast Z rings in plants are more complex because they consist of two distinct types of FtsZ called FtsZ1 and FtsZ2. FtsZ1 and FtsZ2 presumably arose through ancient duplication of a single FtsZ gene acquired from the cyanobacterial endosymbiont and have been conserved throughout green algae and land plants (2Miyagishima S.-Y.

Knockout of either FtsZ1 or FtsZ2 impairs chloroplast division, resulting in reduced numbers of enlarged chloroplasts in leaf cells, and genetic analysis in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana has established that both proteins are required for normal Z-ring function and chloroplast division (35Osteryoung K.W.

Mogi Y. TerBush A.D. Osteryoung K.W. Chloroplast FtsZ assembles into a contractible ring via tubulin-like heteropolymerization.Nat. Plants. 2016; 2: 16095Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).

Both possess a highly conserved globular core region responsible for GTP binding and hydrolysis in all FtsZs, flanked by more variable N- and C-terminal regions (41de Boer P. Crossley R. Rothfield L.

Roles of Arabidopsis PARC6 in coordination of the chloroplast division complex and negative regulation of FtsZ assembly.Plant Physiol. 2016; 170: 250-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). FtsZ1 lacks the CTP and does not interact directly with any known membrane protein. Therefore, its localization to the Z ring is presumed to be a consequence of its coassembly with FtsZ2 (49Maple J.

The two proteins also differ in their dynamic properties, as shown by fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) experiments in which the AtFtsZ proteins were expressed in heterologous yeast systems. While both proteins form homopolymeric filaments and/or rings that undergo subunit exchange in such systems, AtFtsZ2 filaments are much less dynamic than AtFtsZ1 or coassembled filaments (24TerBush A.D.

These studies, in combination with mutant analysis in Arabidopsis, have led to proposals that FtsZ2 imparts structural stability to the Z ring while FtsZ1 opposes this stability and promotes Z-ring turnover dynamics (24TerBush A.D.

Complementary in vitro studies are essential for further understanding of how these proteins cooperate biochemically in the chloroplast Z ring. Here, we used purified AtFtsZ1 and AtFtsZ2 to test their self-assembly behavior in vitro and elucidate how their interactions contribute to their cellular roles. Toward this end we compared the GTPase activities, formation of protofilaments, and assembly kinetics of AtFtsZ1 and AtFtsZ2 separately and in mixture. We provide biochemical evidence that FtsZ1 counterbalances the stabilizing properties of FtsZ2 by restraining its assembly into protofilaments. In a previous analysis, bacterially expressed AtFtsZ proteins were insoluble and had to be renatured (51Olson B.J.S.C. Wang Q. Osteryoung K.W.

Here we optimized expression and purification of soluble, His-tagged AtFtsZ1 and AtFtsZ2 (Fig. 1B) to investigate their in vitro enzymatic and assembly properties. Proteins were expressed without their transit peptides (Fig. 1A) because in vivo these sequences are cleaved upon organelle import (15McAndrew R.S. Froehlich J.E. Vitha S. Stokes K.D. Osteryoung K.W.

https://openalex.org/W3145065113,"Extracellular adenosine plays important roles in modulating the immune responses. We have previously demonstrated that infection of dendritic cells (DC) by Leishmania amazonensis leads to increased expression of CD39 and CD73 and to the selective activation of the low affinity A2B receptors (A2B R), which contributes to DC inhibition, without involvement of the high affinity A2A R. To understand this apparent paradox, we now characterized the alterations of both adenosine receptors in infected cells. With this aim, bone marrow-derived DC from C57BL/6J mice were infected with metacyclic promastigotes of L. amazonensis. Fluorescence microscopy revealed that L. amazonensis infection stimulates the recruitment of A2B R, but not of A2A R, to the surface of infected DC, without altering the amount of mRNA or the total A2B R density, an effect dependent on lipophosphoglycan (LPG). Log-phase promastigotes or axenic amastigotes of L. amazonensis do not stimulate A2B R recruitment. A2B R clusters are localized in caveolin-rich lipid rafts and the disruption of these membrane domains impairs A2B R recruitment and activation. More importantly, our results show that A2B R co-localize with CD39 and CD73 forming a purinergic cluster that allows for the production of extracellular adenosine in close proximity with these receptors. We conclude that A2B R activation by locally produced adenosine constitutes an elegant and powerful evasion mechanism used by L. amazonensis to down-modulate the DC activation."
https://openalex.org/W3148848573,"Over the past several years, global project management teams have been facing dynamic challenges that continue to grow exponentially with the increasing number of complexities associated with the undertaken tasks. The ever-evolving organizational challenges demand project managers to adapt novel management practices to accomplish organizational goals rather than following traditional management practices. Considering which, the current study aims to explain the effect of agile management practices upon project performance directly as well as while being mediated through project complexity. Furthermore, the aforementioned mediatory relationship is evaluated in terms of the moderating effect of leadership competencies. The current study utilized the survey approach to collect the data from registered I.T firms deployed in the potential metropolitans of each province of Pakistan including, Peshawar, Islamabad, Lahore, Sialkot, Faisalabad, Hyderabad, Sukkur, and Karachi. A total of 176 responses were utilized for statistical evaluations. As result, it was observed that the negative influence anticipated by project complexity on project performance was compensated by the agile management practices. Further, the leadership competencies played a pivotal role in managing project complexity while implementing agile management practices and therefore enhancing project performance. The current study abridges the potential knowledge gap conceptually by evaluating the direct impact of agile management upon project performance while considering all of its aspects, exploring the mediatory role of project performance and evaluating the moderating role of leadership competencies in attaining optimum project performance. In contextual terms, the current study fills the knowledge gap by gauging the implications of agile management practices within the I.T sector of Pakistan. The results of the current study can be a potential guide for both the academicians and the industry professionals."
https://openalex.org/W3150999785,"The queen conch fishery in Jamaica is sustained by Pedro Bank, which is the main harvesting site located approximately 80 km south-west from Kingston. Due to its relative size, Pedro Bank has been subdivided into zones for management purposes by the Fisheries Division and the Veterinary Services Division. Understanding whether these sub-divisions reflect different sub-populations is critical for managing exploitation levels because fisheries management must demonstrate that harvesting does not endanger the future viability of the population as queen conch are on Appendix II of the Convention in Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES). This determination is essential for the continued export to international markets such as the European Union. Two hundred and eight samples were collected across the entire Pedro Bank and were genetically characterized using nine polymorphic microsatellite loci. Population structure analysis for Lobatus gigas from Pedro Bank yielded low but significant values (F ST = 0.009: p = 0.006) and suggested a high magnitude of gene flow indicative of a fit and viable population throughout the bank. Analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) indicated a 100% variation within individual samples with little variation (0.9%) between populations. In contrast pairwise genetic comparisons identified significant differences between populations located to the south eastern and eastern region of the bank to those in the central and western locations. Bayesian clustering analysis also indicated the likelihood of two population sub-divisions (K = 2) on Pedro Bank. The results provided evidence of a weak but significant population structure which has crucial implications for the fishing industry as it suggests the use of ecosystem based management (EBM) in setting quotas to promote sustainable harvesting of L . gigas within each monitoring zone on Pedro Bank."

In contrast to the three-factor structure of the original version, the Italian context confirmatory and exploratory factor analyses with splitted sample (CFA = 258; EFA = 248) revealed a five-factor structure. The hierarchically structured MAS factors are: Emotional Processing (being able to process emotion in situations); Expressing Emotions (talking and knowing emotions); Identifying Emotions (awareness of emotions); Control Processing (to control emotional reactions and expression), and Autobiographical Memory (related to childhood experiences). We also verified the convergent validity and reliability of the Italian version of the MAS by correlating the above five factors with measures of emotion regulation and reflective functioning. Moreover, we analyzed the relationships among the factors of the MAS, personality measures and well-being indexes, such as life satisfaction and self-efficacy: The new 35-item MAS scale showed robust correlations with all the tested constructs. Our results confirm that the MAS is a useful measure to assess mentalized affectivity, with the Italian version showing a more complex structure than the original English one, thus enriching the literature about mentalization."
https://openalex.org/W3142209201,"Instrumental variable (IV) analysis is used to address unmeasured confounding when comparing two nonrandomized treatment groups. The local average treatment effect (LATE) is a causal estimand that can be identified by an IV. The LATE approach is appealing because its identification relies on weaker assumptions than those in other IV approaches requiring a homogeneous treatment effect assumption. If the instrument is confounded by some covariates, then one can use a weighting estimator, for which the outcome and treatment are weighted by instrumental propensity scores. The weighting estimator for the LATE has a large variance when the IV is weak and the target population, i.e., the compliers, is relatively small. We propose a truncated LATE that can be estimated more reliably than the regular LATE in the presence of a weak IV. In our approach, subjects who contribute substantially to the weak IV are identified by their probabilities of being compliers, and they are removed based on a pre-specified threshold. We discuss interpretation of the proposed estimand and related inference method. Simulation and real data experiments demonstrate that the proposed truncated LATE can be estimated more precisely than the standard LATE."
https://openalex.org/W3143188707,"Researchers often use moral dilemmas to investigate the specific factors that influence participants’ judgments of the appropriateness of different actions. A common construction of such a dilemma is the Trolley Problem, which pits an obvious utilitarian solution against a common deontological dictum to not do harm to others. Cross-cultural studies have validated the robustness of numerous contextual biases, such as judging utilitarian decisions more negatively if they require contact with other individuals (contact bias), they force others to serve as a means to an end (means bias), and if they require direct action rather than inaction (omission bias). However, such cross-cultural research is largely limited to studies of industrialized, nation-state populations. Previous research has suggested that the more intimate community relationships that characterize small-scale populations might lead to important differences, such as an absence of an omission bias. Here we contribute to this literature by investigating perceptions of Trolley Problem solutions among a Mayangna/Miskito community, a small-scale indigenous population in Nicaragua. Compared to previously sampled populations, the Mayangna/Miskito participants report higher levels of acceptance of utilitarian solutions and do not exhibit an omission bias. We also examine the justifications participants offered to explore how Mayangna/Miskito culture might influence moral judgments."
https://openalex.org/W3144044656,"Introduction During viral pandemics, filtering facepiece (FFP) masks together with eye protection form the essential components of personal protective equipment (PPE) for healthcare workers. There remain concerns regarding insufficient global supply and imperfect protection offered by currently available PPE strategies. A range of full-face snorkel masks were adapted to accept high grade medical respiratory filters using bespoke-designed 3D-printed connectors. We compared the protection offered by the snorkel to that of standard PPE using a placebo-controlled respirator filtering test as well as a fluorescent droplet deposition experiment. Out of the 56 subjects tested, 42 (75%) passed filtering testing with the snorkel mask compared to 31 (55%) with a FFP3 respirator mask (p = 0.003). Amongst the 43 subjects who were not excluded following a placebo control, 85% passed filtering testing with the snorkel versus to 68% with a FFP3 mask (p = 0.008). Following front and lateral spray of fluorescence liquid particles, the snorkel mask also provided superior protection against droplet deposition within the subject’s face, when compared to a standard PPE combination of FFP3 masks and eye protection (3.19x10 8 versus 6.81x10 8 fluorescence units, p&lt;0.001). The 3D printable adaptors are available for free download online at https://www.ImperialHackspace.com/COVID-19-Snorkel-Respirator-Project/ . Conclusion Full-face snorkel masks adapted as particulate respirators performed better than a standard PPE combination of FFP3 mask and eye protection against aerosol inhalation and droplet deposition. This adaptation is therefore a promising PPE solution for healthcare workers during highly contagious viral outbreaks."
https://openalex.org/W3145355587,"Mouse models of various neuropsychiatric disorders, such as schizophrenia, often display an immature dentate gyrus, characterized by increased numbers of immature neurons and neuronal progenitors and a dearth of mature neurons. We previously demonstrated that the CRMP5-associated GTPase (CRAG), a short splice variant of Centaurin-γ3/AGAP3, is highly expressed in the dentate gyrus. CRAG promotes cell survival and antioxidant defense by inducing the activation of serum response factors at promyelocytic leukemia protein bodies, which are nuclear stress-responsive domains, during neuronal development. However, the physiological role of CRAG in neuronal development remains unknown. Here, we analyzed the role of CRAG using dorsal forebrain-specific CRAG/Centaurin-γ3 knockout mice. The mice revealed maturational abnormality of the hippocampal granule cells, including increased doublecortin-positive immature neurons and decreased calbindin-positive mature neurons, a typical phenotype of immature dentate gyri. Furthermore, the mice displayed hyperactivity in the open-field test, a common measure of exploratory behavior, suggesting that these mice may serve as a novel model for neuropsychiatric disorder associated with hyperactivity. Thus, we conclude that CRAG is required for the maturation of neurons in the dentate gyrus, raising the possibility that its deficiency might promote the development of psychiatric disorders in humans.

Abnormalities in brain networks cause psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia. Studies using knockout (KO) mice are elucidating the relationship between brain structure and behavioral abnormalities. Immature dentate gyrus (iDG) has been reported as a common phenotype in mice with hyperactivity, which is one of the typical behavioral abnormalities (1Yamasaki N. Maekawa M. Kobayashi K. Kajii Y.

In detail, iDG is a phenomenon in which nerve cells (granule cells) of the hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG) are in a pseudo-immature state in terms of molecular and electrophysiological characteristics (4Hagihara H. Fujita M. Umemori J. Hashimoto M. Miyakawa T. Immature-like molecular expression patterns in the hippocampus of a mouse model of dementia with Lewy body-linked mutant β-synuclein.Mol. Brain. 2018; 11: 38Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar), and similar symptoms have been observed in schizophrenia patients (5Walton N.M. Zhou Y. Kogan J.H. Shin R. Webster M. Gross A.K.

Psychiatry. 2012; 2e135Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), suggesting that iDG is one of the endophenotypes in the brain shared with several neuropsychiatric disorders. Accumulating reports show that neurogenesis occurs in the hippocampal DG of adults (6Gonçalves J.T. Schafer S.T. Gage F.H.

Molecular biomarkers for embryonic and adult neural stem cell and neurogenesis.Biomed. Res. Int. 2015; 2015: 727542PubMed Google Scholar). Adult neurogenesis in the DG is approximately divided into six stages: type-1 cells, type-2a cells, type-2b cells, type-3 cells, immature, and mature neurons. Type-1 cells, radial-glia-like neural stem cells, express astrocytic marker glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and SOX2 and locate in the subgranular zone (SGZ) (9Bonaguidi M.A. Wheeler M.A. Shapiro J.S. Stadel R.P. Sun G.J. Ming G.L. Song H. In vivo clonal analysis reveals self-renewing and multipotent adult neural stem cell characteristics.Cell. 2011; 145: 1142-1155Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar). Type-2a and type-2b cells are classified as intermediate progenitor cells. Type-2a cells express SOX2 and potent capacity of self-renewal. Type-3 cells are neuroblasts that differentiate into immature neurons. Doublecortin (DCX) is expressed in type-2a, type-2b, type-3, and immature neurons. Ca2+-binding protein calretinin expression is found in immature neurons, which are more excitable than mature neurons. Mature granule cells express calbindin. Interestingly, the reversal of neuronal maturation is observed in the DG of adult mice (10Hagihara H. Murano T. Ohira K. Miwa M. Nakamura K. Miyakawa T. Expression of progenitor cell/immature neuron markers does not present definitive evidence for adult neurogenesis.Mol. Brain. 2019; 12: 108Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Chronic treatment with antidepressant, fluoxetine, causes re-expression of DCX and calretinin in mature granule cells (11Hagihara H. Ohira K. Miyakawa T. Transcriptomic evidence for immaturity induced by antidepressant fluoxetine in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex.Neuropsychopharmacol. Rep. 2019; 39: 78-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Disruption of maturation and dematuration is associated with iDG. Neural circuits are complicatedly organized and perform accurate intersynaptic transmission in the networks. Differentiating nerve cells extend axons, reach target cells, and form synapses. The nerve repulsion factors semaphorins play important roles in neural network formation. By screening for signaling targets of semaphorins, we previously identified CRMP5-Associated GTPase (CRAG), a guanosine triphosphatase (GTPase) that is an alternative splicing variant of Centaurin-γ3/AGAP3 (12Qin Q. Inatome R. Hotta A. Kojima M. Yamamura H. Hirai H. Yoshizawa T. Tanaka H. Fukami K. Yanagi S. A novel GTPase, CRAG, mediates promyelocytic leukemia protein-associated nuclear body formation and degradation of expanded polyglutamine protein.J. Cell Biol. 2006; 172: 497-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Centaurin-γ3, a long isoform of the AGAP3 gene, regulates Arf6-mediated vesicle transport through a Centaurin-γ3-specific region (13Oku Y. Huganir R.L. AGAP3 and Arf6 regulate trafficking of AMPA receptors and synaptic plasticity.J. Neurosci. 2013; 33: 12586-12598Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), suggesting that CRAG and Centaurin-γ3 have different functions. CRAG is highly expressed in the nervous system. It has been reported that CRAG degrades abnormally expanded polyglutamine (PolyQ), which is a denatured protein, and that lentivirus-mediated CRAG expression in the cerebral brain of polyglutamine disease model mice results in clearance of the PolyQ aggregates and the rescue of ataxia (14Torashima T. Koyama C. Iizuka A. Mitsumura K. Takayama K. Yanagi S. Oue M. Yamaguchi H. Hirai H. Lentivector-mediated rescue from cerebellar ataxia in a mouse model of spinocerebellar ataxia.EMBO Rep. 2008; 9: 393-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). These results suggest the possibility of performing gene therapy for polyglutamine disease using CRAG. In addition, we previously reported that CRAG enhances the cell survival signal against PolyQ accumulation via the activation of c-Fos-dependent activator protein-1 (AP-1) (15Nagashima S. Fukuda T. Kubota Y. Sugiura A. Nakao M. Inatome R. Yanagi S. CRAG protects neuronal cells against cytotoxicity of expanded polyglutamine protein partially via C-FOS-dependent AP-1 activation.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 33879-33889Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) and that CRAG activates serum response factor (SRF) by interacting with promyelocytic leukemia protein (PML) through its SUMO-interacting motifs (16Nagashima S. Takeda K. Shiiba I. Higashi M. Fukuda T. Tokuyama T. Matsushita N. Nagano S. Araki T. Kaneko M. Shioi G. Inatome R. Yanagi S. Critical role of CRAG, a splicing variant of centaurin-gamma3/AGAP3, in ELK1-dependent SRF activation at PML bodies.Sci. Rep. 2019; 9: 20107Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar). However, the physiological functions of CRAG in the brain remain largely unknown. In the present study, we show that CRAG/Centaurin-γ3-KO mice exhibit hyperactivity and iDG phenotypes. Furthermore, KO of CRAG/Centaurin-γ3 was found to disrupt adult neurogenesis in the DG of the hippocampus. These results suggest that CRAG/Centaurin-γ3 is involved in the pathophysiology of psychiatric disorders. CRAG, a splicing variant of Centaurin-γ3, is dominantly expressed in the brain. Western blot analysis of hippocampal lysates showed that CRAG expression was gradually enhanced from 2-week-old mice (Fig. 1A). We previously generated whole-body CRAG/Centaurin-γ3-KO mice (WKO), which may selectively reflect CRAG dysfunction (16Nagashima S. Takeda K. Shiiba I. Higashi M. Fukuda T. Tokuyama T. Matsushita N. Nagano S. Araki T. Kaneko M. Shioi G. Inatome R. Yanagi S. Critical role of CRAG, a splicing variant of centaurin-gamma3/AGAP3, in ELK1-dependent SRF activation at PML bodies.Sci. Rep. 2019; 9: 20107Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar). Overall, 60% of WKO mice died within 2 months of birth (Fig. 1B). To determine whether the cause of death was neuronal dysfunction, we generated central nervous system (CNS)-specific CRAG/Centaurin-γ3-KO (NKO) mice by crossing CRAG/Centaurin-γ3 floxed mice with nestin-Cre transgenic mice (17Tronche F. Kellendonk C. Kretz O. Gass P. Anlag K. Orban P.C. Bock R. Klein R. Schutz G. Disruption of the glucocorticoid receptor gene in the nervous system results in reduced anxiety.Nat. Genet. 1999; 23: 99-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (1368) Google Scholar). Western blot analysis showed that the bands of CRAG and Centaurin-γ3 disappeared in the whole brain lysates of WKO and NKO (Fig. 1C). The NKO mice had survival rates similar to those of WKO mice (Fig. 1B), indicating that the WKO mice had died from CNS dysfunction. WKO and NKO had smaller body size and weight than wild-type (WT) mice (Fig. 1, D and E). To further assess the CRAG/Centaurin-γ3 KO mice, we performed the open-field test. Both WKO and NKO exhibited hyperactivity and increased total distance traveled (Fig. 1, F and G). Taking these findings together, CRAG/Centaurin-γ3 loss in the CNS causes impairment of body growth and abnormal behavior. Mice with the abnormalities of hippocampal neurons exhibit hyperactivity (3Hagihara H. Takao K. Walton N.M. Matsumoto M. Miyakawa T. Immature dentate gyrus: An endophenotype of neuropsychiatric disorders.Neural Plast. 2013; 2013: 318596Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). To test this possibility, we generated dorsal forebrain-specific CRAG/Centaurin-γ3-KO (EKO) mice by crossing CRAG/Centaurin-γ3 floxed mice with Emx1-Cre transgenic mice (18Iwasato T. Nomura R. Ando R. Ikeda T. Tanaka M. Itohara S. Dorsal telencephalon-specific expression of Cre recombinase in PAC transgenic mice.Genesis. 2004; 38: 130-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Because Emx1-Cre drives Cre expression mainly in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus, the deletion of CRAG and Centaurin-γ3 was restricted in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus (Fig. 2A). As expected, EKO was associated with increased locomotor activity in mice at both P21 and 8 weeks old (Fig. 2, B–E). The open-field test is used to assess anxiety behavior (19Crawley J.N. Exploratory behavior models of anxiety in mice.Neurosci. Biobehav. Rev. 1985; 9: 37-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar). An increased time spent in the center area suggests less anxiety. To investigate whether EKO displays increased anxiety-like behavior, we analyzed the time spent in the center area (Fig. S1). Any significant difference was not observed in the time spent in the center area, suggesting that hyperactivity in EKO was not caused by anxiety. These findings suggest that forebrain-specific deletion of CRAG/Centaurin-γ3 causes hyperactivity in mice. A reduction in mature neuronal markers and an increase in immature neuronal markers are observed in the hippocampus of mice showing increased locomotor activity (3Hagihara H. Takao K. Walton N.M. Matsumoto M. Miyakawa T. Immature dentate gyrus: An endophenotype of neuropsychiatric disorders.Neural Plast. 2013; 2013: 318596Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 20Kobayashi M. Nakatani T. Koda T. Matsumoto K. Ozaki R. Mochida N. Takao K. Miyakawa T. Matsuoka I. Absence of BRINP1 in mice causes increase of hippocampal neurogenesis and behavioral alterations relevant to human psychiatric disorders.Mol. Brain. 2014; 7: 12Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). To test mature neurons in the DG, we performed immunostaining with anti-Calbindin antibody. The Calbindin-positive area was significantly reduced in the DG of EKO (Fig. 3, A and B). The phenotype of mature neuron reduction in EKO may not have been due to apparent cell loss, since nuclear staining was observed uniformly throughout the DG granule cell layer. We checked the calbindin expression in the cerebral cortex (Fig. S2A) and the hippocampal CA1 regions (Fig. S2B). There was no significant difference in the calbindin expression level in the cerebral cortex of EKO. Although calbindin-positive cells were not significantly reduced in CA1 of EKO, the signal intensity of calbindin was reduced. Compared with the DG, the differences of the calbindin expression are much less in these regions. To characterize the decreased neurons in the DG of EKO, we performed the histological analysis with neuronal cell marker NeuN. NeuN-positive cells were not altered in the DG of EKO (Fig. S2C), indicating that the calbindin-positive mature neurons are selectively reduced in the DG of EKO. NeuN-positive cells include both calretinin-positive cells and immature neurons (21Brandt M.D. Jessberger S. Steiner B. Kronenberg G. Reuter K. Bick-Sander A. von der Behrens W. Kempermann G. Transient calretinin expression defines early postmitotic step of neuronal differentiation in adult hippocampal neurogenesis of mice.Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2003; 24: 603-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar, 22von Bohlen Und Halbach O. Immunohistological markers for staging neurogenesis in adult hippocampus.Cell Tissue Res. 2007; 329: 409-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). As expected, calretinin-positive neurons were increased in the DG of EKO (Fig. 3, C and D). In addition, DCX, which is expressed in neuronal progenitors, neuroblasts, and immature neurons, was significantly increased in the DG of EKO (Fig. 3, E and F). Histological analysis of EKO at P28 showed that calbindin-positive cell layers in the DG of EKO were shorten as compared with WT (Fig. S3A). Calbindin-positive area was reduced in the DG of EKO at P28 (Fig. S3B) as well as in the DG of 8-week-old EKO. On the other hand, no significant difference in DCX-positive area was observed between WT and EKO at P28 (Fig. S3, A and C). Many DCX-positive cells in both WT and EKO suggest that neurogenesis is active at this stage. It is therefore considered that no significant difference was observed in DCX-positive cells at P28 due to active neurogenesis. Furthermore, we evaluated molecular markers for iDG using qRT-PCR (23Shin R. Kobayashi K. Hagihara H. Kogan J.H. Miyake S. Tajinda K. Walton N.M. Gross A.K. Heusner C.L. Chen Q. Tamura K. Miyakawa T. Matsumoto M. The immature dentate gyrus represents a shared phenotype of mouse models of epilepsy and psychiatric disease.Bipolar Disord. 2013; 15: 405-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Consistent with the immunohistochemical analysis, Calbindin mRNA levels showed significant downregulation in the hippocampus of EKO (Fig. 3G). Desmoplakin (Dsp) and tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase (Tdo2) are maturation marker genes that were highly expressed in the DG and were significantly reduced in the hippocampus of EKO. We additionally observed increased mRNA levels of iDG markers such as dopamine receptor D1A (Drd1a) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). Taking these findings together, EKO displays iDG phenotype in terms of molecular expression patterns. To demonstrate how the loss of CRAG/Centaurin-γ3 contributes to the maturational abnormality of the hippocampal granule cells, we analyzed neurogenesis in the DG because abnormally generated neurons affect hippocampal maturation and locomotor activity (20Kobayashi M. Nakatani T. Koda T. Matsumoto K. Ozaki R. Mochida N. Takao K. Miyakawa T. Matsuoka I. Absence of BRINP1 in mice causes increase of hippocampal neurogenesis and behavioral alterations relevant to human psychiatric disorders.Mol. Brain. 2014; 7: 12Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). To assess the level of adult neurogenesis in the DG, we examined the number of 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU)-positive cells after the intraperitoneal injection of BrdU. BrdU-positive cells were significantly increased in the DG of EKO compared with the level in WT (Fig. 4, A and B), indicating enhanced neurogenesis in the DG of EKO. We traced the BrdU-incorporated cells in the DG. The population of DCX-positive BrdU-labeled cells was increased in the DG of EKO (Fig. 4, C and D). To understand the role of CRAG/Centaurin-γ3 in adult neural stem cell differentiation, we traced the BrdU-incorporated cells and colabeled with SOX2, a neuronal progenitor cell marker, 1 day after BrdU injections (Fig. S4A). Consistent with Figure 4B, BrdU-positive cells were increased in the DG (Fig. S4B). SOX2-positive BrdU-labeled cells were increased, whereas SOX2-negative BrdU-labeled cells were not altered (Fig. S4C). SOX2-negative BrdU-labeled cells include neuroblasts, immature neurons, and mature neurons, indicating that newly generated cells can differentiate into neuroblasts and neurons in the DG of EKO. These results suggest that CRAG/Centaurin-γ3 ablation causes the accumulation of immature neurons. To examine whether CRAG/Centaurin-γ3 loss affects neuronal maturation at embryonic development stage, histological analysis was performed at P10 after BrdU injection at E15 (Fig. S5A). The number of BrdU-positive cells was not changed, suggesting that CRAG/Centaurin-γ3 did not affect embryonic neurogenesis (Fig. S5B). Moreover, BrdU-positive cells were observed in the granule cell layer, which is apart from the SGZ where neurogenesis occurs. This suggests that CRAG/Centaurin-γ3 is not critical for neuronal maturation at embryonic development stage. Neurogenesis, which is important for the formation of neural networks, is most activated during fetal life and decreases with growth, but it was found that adult neurogenesis occurs in certain areas of the olfactory bulb and hippocampus of the adult brain. Dysregulation of adult neurogenesis in the DG is associated with psychiatric disorders and abnormal behaviors (24Kang E. Wen Z. Song H. Christian K.M. Ming G.L. Adult neurogenesis and psychiatric disorders.Cold Spring Harb. Perspect. Biol. 2016; 8a019026Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). BMP/RA-induced neural-specific protein-1 (BRINP1) suppresses the cell cycle in neural stem cells (25Terashima M. Kobayashi M. Motomiya M. Inoue N. Yoshida T. Okano H. Iwasaki N. Minami A. Matsuoka I. Analysis of the expression and function of BRINP family genes during neuronal differentiation in mouse embryonic stem cell-derived neural stem cells.J. Neurosci. Res. 2010; 88: 1387-1393PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, BRINP1 KO mice exhibit hyperactivity accompanied by an increase of hippocampal neurogenesis (20Kobayashi M. Nakatani T. Koda T. Matsumoto K. Ozaki R. Mochida N. Takao K. Miyakawa T. Matsuoka I. Absence of BRINP1 in mice causes increase of hippocampal neurogenesis and behavioral alterations relevant to human psychiatric disorders.Mol. Brain. 2014; 7: 12Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Moreover, increasing adult neurogenesis by Bax deletion enhances exploratory behavior but not locomotor activity in the home cage (26Sahay A. Scobie K.N. Hill A.S. O'Carroll C.M. Kheirbek M.A. Burghardt N.S. Fenton A.A. Dranovsky A. Hen R. Increasing adult hippocampal neurogenesis is sufficient to improve pattern separation.Nature. 2011; 472: 466-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (1014) Google Scholar). These studies prompted us to examine whether CRAG deletion also causes a similar increase of adult neurogenesis because CRAG overexpression in cells induces growth arrest through the functional modification of PML body. In our previous study, CRAG was shown to bind with PML via its SUMO-interacting motifs (16Nagashima S. Takeda K. Shiiba I. Higashi M. Fukuda T. Tokuyama T. Matsushita N. Nagano S. Araki T. Kaneko M. Shioi G. Inatome R. Yanagi S. Critical role of CRAG, a splicing variant of centaurin-gamma3/AGAP3, in ELK1-dependent SRF activation at PML bodies.Sci. Rep. 2019; 9: 20107Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar). PML, a tumor suppressor, regulates cell-cycle progression of the nervous system as PML loss was found to disrupt neuronal cell differentiation and increase neurogenesis (27Regad T. Bellodi C. Nicotera P. Salomoni P. The tumor suppressor Pml regulates cell fate in the developing neocortex.Nat. Neurosci. 2009; 12: 132-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Interestingly, CRAG expression is gradually increased in the hippocampus from 2 weeks old (Fig. 1A), suggesting that CRAG affects adult neurogenesis in the DG but not neurogenesis during the fetal stage. The cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor P57KIP2 regulates both embryonic and adult neurogenesis because its deletion was found to promote neurogenesis (28Mairet-Coello G. Tury A. Van Buskirk E. Robinson K. Genestine M.

Gotoh Y. p57 controls adult neural stem cell quiescence and modulates the pace of lifelong neurogenesis.EMBO J. 2013; 32: 970-981Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Although embryonic neurogenesis and adult neurogenesis have a common regulatory mechanism, it is speculated that they have some differences in terms of the regulatory machinery. CRAG could be involved in an adult neurogenesis-specific regulatory system, rather than being involved in the embryonic period. CRAG/Centaurin-γ3 mice showed iDG phenotypes. It has been reported that chronic treatment with the antidepressant fluoxetine, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, induces the reversal of neuronal maturation in the DG and causes iDG phenotypes in adult mice (11Hagihara H.

Reversal of hippocampal neuronal maturation by serotonergic antidepressants.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2010; 107: 8434-8439Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). The reversal of neuronal maturation in adult mice could also be induced by pilocarpine-induced seizures (23Shin R. Kobayashi K. Hagihara H. Kogan J.H. Miyake S. Tajinda K. Walton N.M. Gross A.K. Heusner C.L. Chen Q. Tamura K. Miyakawa T. Matsumoto M. The immature dentate gyrus represents a shared phenotype of mouse models of epilepsy and psychiatric disease.Bipolar Disord. 2013; 15: 405-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) and electroconvulsive stimulations (31Imoto Y. Segi-Nishida E. Suzuki H. Kobayashi K. Rapid and stable changes in maturation-related phenotypes of the adult hippocampal neurons by electroconvulsive treatment.Mol. Brain. 2017; 10: 8Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Given that the effects of CRAG deficiency appear after 2 weeks of age (Fig. 1A), the decreased calbindin-immunoreactive area in CRAG/Centaurin-γ3 KO mice may be due in part to the reversal of neuronal maturation. Moreover, deletion of CRAG/Centaurin-γ3 disrupted neuronal maturation in the DG (Fig. 4, C and D), indicating that CRAG/Centaurin-γ3 is involved in neuronal maturation. We previously demonstrated that CRAG activates transcription factors such as SRF and AP-1 (16Nagashima S. Takeda K. Shiiba I. Higashi M. Fukuda T. Tokuyama T. Matsushita N. Nagano S. Araki T. Kaneko M. Shioi G. Inatome R. Yanagi S. Critical role of CRAG, a splicing variant of centaurin-gamma3/AGAP3, in ELK1-dependent SRF activation at PML bodies.Sci. Rep. 2019; 9: 20107Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar). SRF is highly expressed in the granular cells of the DG (32Etkin A. Alarcón J.M. Weisberg S.P. Touzani K. Huang Y.Y. Nordheim A.

Neurosci. 2006; 9: 195-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), and contributes to hippocampal layer and nerve fiber organization (34Stritt C. Knöll B. Serum response factor regulates hippocampal lamination and dendrite development and is connected with reelin signaling.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2010; 30: 1828-1837Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). These reports indicate that SRF is an important regulator of hippocampal development. In addition, forebrain-specific SRF KO mice exhibit increased locomotor activity, as do CRAG/Centaurin-γ3 KO mice (35Nader K. Krysiak A. Beroun A. Pekala M. Szymanska M. Kuzniewska B. Radwanska K. Kaczmarek L. Kalita K. Loss of serum response factor in mature neurons in the dentate gyrus alters the morphology of dendritic spines and hippocampus-dependent behavioral tasks.Brain Struct. Funct. 2019; 224: 2691-2701Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Downregulation of SRF in CRAG/Centaurin-γ3 KO mice may suppress neuronal maturation and thereby induce iDG phenotypes. We previously demonstrated that lentivector-mediated expression of CRAG in Purkinje cells of PolyQ disease model mice extensively cleared PolyQ aggregates and reactivated dendritic differentiation, resulting in a striking rescue from ataxia (14Torashima T. Koyama C. Iizuka A. Mitsumura K. Takayama K. Yanagi S. Oue M. Yamaguchi H. Hirai H. Lentivector-mediated rescue from cerebellar ataxia in a mouse model of spinocerebellar ataxia.EMBO Rep. 2008; 9: 393-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The phenotype of decreased calbindin-positive mature neurons in the hippocampus is observed in mouse models of neurodegenerative disease such as dementia with Lewy bodies (4Hagihara H. Fujita M. Umemori J. Hashimoto M. Miyakawa T. Immature-like molecular expression patterns in the hippocampus of a mouse model of dementia with Lewy body-linked mutant β-synuclein.Mol. Brain. 2018; 11: 38Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar) and Alzheimer’s disease (36You J.C. Muralidharan K. Park J.W. Petrof I. Pyfer M.S. Corbett B.F. LaFrancois J.J. Zheng Y. Zhang X.

Med. 2017; 23: 1377-1383Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), suggesting that the phenotype of iDG can be an intermediate phenotype between psychiatric and neurodegenerative diseases. CRAG gene delivery or drugs that can activate CRAG in the brain may also have therapeutic potential in the treatment of mental illness. All animals were maintained under university guidelines for the care and use of animals. The experiments were performed after securing Tokyo University of Pharmacy and Life Sciences Animal Use Committee Protocol approval. CRAG flox/flox mice (Accession No. CDB0630K: http://www2.clst.riken.jp/arg/mutant%20mice%20list.html) and WKO mice were reported previously (16Nagashima S. Takeda K. Shiiba I. Higashi M. Fukuda T.

Cre-negative CRAG flox/flox and CRAG +/flox mice were used as WT mice. Genotype was confirmed by tail tipping mice at around 1 month. Mice were genotyped for CRAG gene using PCR primer A, 5’-CTCAGGATGACTCCCGAACTCTATACGG-3’, and primer B, 5’-CTGGCAGGGCCTGGTAGATGTGCTTCATTG-3’, primer C, 5’-GATTGGCGGCACTGATGGCATCTGTTGG-3’.

Cell Biol. 2006; 172: 497-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Rabbit polyclonal anti-AGAP3 (NBP1-22968) antibody was purchased from Novus Biologicals. Mouse monoclonal anti-α-tubulin (T9026) and anti-Calretinin (C7479) antibodies were purchased from Sigma. Mouse monoclonal anti-GAPDH (ACR001P) antibody was purchased from Origene. Mouse monoclonal anti-Calbindin D-28K (300) antibody was purchased from Swant. Mouse monoclonal anti-NeuN (MAB377) antibody was purchased from Merck Millipore. Rabbit polyclonal anti-Doublecortin (ab77450) antibody was purchased from Abcam. Rat monoclonal anti-BrdU (MCA2060) antibody was purchased from AbD Serotec. For the brain samples, the brain was resuspended in lysis buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl (pH7.4), 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 0.05% DOC, 10 μg/ml Aprotinin, 10 μg/ml Leupeptin, 1 mM PMSF). The insoluble debris was removed by centrifugation at 15,000g for 15 min at 4 °C. Samples were mixed with 2x SDS-PAGE sample buffer (125 mM Tris-HCl (pH6.8), 4% SDS, 10% sucrose, 10% 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.01% bromophenol blue). The protein concentrations were measured by Protein Quantification Assay (TaKaRa). Samples were diluted to 0.15 μg/μl with 1x SDS-PAGE sample buffer and then incubated at 95 °C for 5 min. Samples were separated by SDS-PAGE and then transferred to PVDF membranes (Millipore). For western blot analysis, the membranes were blocked with 2.5% skim milk in Tris-buffered saline with 0.1% Tween-20 (TBST). Membranes were incubated with first antibody at 4 °C overnight and second antibody for 1 h at room temperature. The protein bands were treated with enhanced chemiluminescence reagent (Millipore) and detected by using LuminoGraph (ATTO). Mice were perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) and the brains were isolated. Brains were fixed in 4% PFA overnight at 4 °C, and 40 μm slice sections were prepared. For fluorescent stains, sections were incubated in 0.1% Triton X-100/PBS for 15 min, washed with PBS, blocked with 0.5% blocking reagent (Roche) in 0.1% Triton X-100/PBS, and incubated for two nights at 4 °C with primary antibodies. Slices were incubated overnight with Alexa-conjugated secondary antibodies and counterstained with Hoechst 33258. For BrdU staining, sections were incubated in 0.4% Triton X-100/PBS for 10 min, washed with PBS, treated with 2 M HCl for 25 min at 37 °C, neutralized with 40 mM boric acid, washed with PBS, blocked with 0.5% blocking reagent (Roche) in 0.1% Triton X-100/PBS, and incubated for two nights at 4 °C with primary antibodies. Slices were incubated overnight with Alexa-conjugated secondary antibodies. The samples were analyzed using an Olympus FV1000-D confocal fluorescence microscope. The fluorescent area was manually measured in the ROI (0.0625 mm2) of the DG using Fiji software (37Schindelin J. Arganda-Carreras I. Frise E. Kaynig V. Longair M. Pietzsch T. Preibisch S. Rueden C.

Methods. 2012; 9: 676-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (23200) Google Scholar). Calretinin positive cells were manually counted in the ROI (0.24 mm2) of the DG. For BrdU labeling, 8-week-old mice received five consecutive daily injections of BrdU (100 mg⁄kg body weight per day) intraperitoneally, and mice were killed 4 weeks and 1 day following the last BrdU injection, respectively. BrdU (100 mg/kg body weight) was injected intraperitoneally into mice at E15 and the mice were analyzed at P10. For the stereological analysis of the total BrdU-positive cells at 8 weeks old and 12 weeks old, every sixth 40-μm-thick section was counted throughout the hippocampus, and the sum was multiplied by 6 to provide an estimate of the total number of BrdU-positive cells in the entire region. For the analysis of the BrdU-positive cells at P10, the number of BrdU-positive cells was the average number of BrdU-positive cells in the DG of two sections. Total RNA was obtained from the hippocampus of 8-week-old mice. RNA isolation and qPCR were performed as previously described (4Hagihara H. Fujita M. Umemori J. Hashimoto M. Miyakawa T. Immature-like molecular expression patterns in the hippocampus of a mouse model of dementia with Lewy body-linked mutant β-synuclein.Mol.

Mice were placed in the center of apparatus, and mouse movements were recorded with a video camera for 10 min. Total distance traveled was measured using Meander. The center area was defined as the central 30 × 30 cm portion. All statistical analyses were performed using PRISM 6 (Graph Pad). ∗p < 0.05, ∗∗p < 0.01, ∗∗∗p < 0.001 and ∗∗∗∗p < 0.0001 were considered significant.

https://openalex.org/W3145499994,"Traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI) is a devastating neurological condition that involves both primary and secondary tissue loss. Various cytotoxic events including hypoxia, hemorrhage and blood lysis, bioenergetic failure, oxidative stress, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, and neuroinflammation contribute to secondary injury. The HIF prolyl hydroxylase domain (PHD/EGLN) family of proteins are iron-dependent, oxygen-sensing enzymes that regulate the stability of hypoxia inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) and also mediate oxidative stress caused by free iron liberated from the lysis of blood. PHD inhibition improves outcome after experimental intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) by reducing activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4)-driven neuronal death. As the ATF4-CHOP (CCAAT-enhancer-binding protein homologous protein) pathway plays a role in the pathogenesis of contusive SCI, we examined the effects of PHD inhibition in a mouse model of moderate T9 contusive SCI in which white matter damage is the primary driver of locomotor dysfunction. Pharmacological inhibition of PHDs using adaptaquin (AQ) moderately lowers acute induction of Atf4 and Chop mRNAs and prevents the acute decline of oligodendrocyte (OL) lineage mRNAs, but does not improve long-term recovery of hindlimb locomotion or increase chronic white matter sparing. Conditional genetic ablation of all three PHD isoenzymes in OLs did not affect Atf4 , Chop or OL mRNAs expression levels, locomotor recovery, and white matter sparing after SCI. Hence, PHDs may not be suitable targets to improve outcomes in traumatic CNS pathologies that involve acute white matter injury."
https://openalex.org/W3144649213,"The scavenger receptor class B type 1 (SR-B1), a high-density lipoprotein (HDL) receptor, is a membrane glycoprotein that mediates selective uptake of HDL-cholesterol and cholesterol ester (CE) into cells. SR-B1 is subject to posttranslational regulation; however, the underlying mechanisms still remain obscure. Here, we identified a novel SR-B1-interacting protein, GIPC1 (GAIP-interacting protein, C terminus 1) that interacts with SR-B1 and stabilizes SR-B1 by negative regulation of its proteasomal and lysosomal degradation pathways. The physiological interaction between SR-B1 and GIPC1 was supported by co-immunoprecipitation of wild-type and mutant GIPC1 constructs in SR-B1 ± GIPC1 overexpressing cells, in native liver cells, and in mouse liver tissues. Overexpression of GIPC1 increased endogenous SR-B1 protein levels, subsequently increasing selective HDL-cholesterol/CE uptake and cellular triglyceride (TG) and total cholesterol (TC) levels, whereas silencing of GIPC1 in the mouse liver was associated with blunted hepatic SR-B1 levels, elevated plasma TG and TC, and attenuated hepatic TG and TC content. A positive correlation was identified between GIPC1 and SR-B1 expression, and both expressions of GIPC1 and SR-B1 from human liver samples were inversely correlated with body mass index (BMI) from human subjects. We therefore conclude that GIPC1 plays a key role in the stability and function of SR-B1 and can also effectively regulate hepatic lipid and cholesterol metabolism. These findings expand our knowledge of the regulatory roles of GIPC1 and suggest that GIPC1 exerts a major effect on cell surface receptors such as SR-B1 and its associated hepatic lipid and cholesterol metabolic processes.

Scavenger receptor class B, type 1 (SR-B1) is an integral membrane glycoprotein that functions as a receptor for lipoproteins such as high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) (1Shen W.J.

SR-B1 preferentially mediates selective uptake of HDL (and other lipoprotein)-derived cholesterol, cholesteryl esters (CEs), and unesterified cholesterol (UC), and it has also been shown that it facilitates free fatty acid (FFA) uptake in both primary adipocytes and model adipocyte cell lines (3Wang W.

Lipids. 2020; 1865: 158554Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). SR-B1 plays an important role in the reverse cholesterol transport (RCT), a process by which excess cholesterol from peripheral tissues is transferred to the liver for metabolism and excretion into the bile and provides cholesterol substrate to the steroidogenic cells of the adrenal gland, ovary, and testis for steroid hormone production (2Shen W.J.

Given this, it is not surprising that SR-B1 is expressed at high levels in the liver and steroidogenic cells of the adrenal gland and ovary and testis (1Shen W.J. Azhar S. Kraemer F.B.

In both rodent and human steroidogenic tissues, the expression of steroidogenic SR-B1 is subject to transcriptional regulation by tissue-specific tropic hormones (e.g., adrenal, ACTH, ovary, LH/FSH, and Leydig cells of testis, LH) via several transcription factors such as SF-1, LXRα and LXRβ, Sp1, PPARα, SREBP-1a, LRH-1, ERα and ERβ, CREB and NR0B1/DAX-1 (1Shen W.J.

Both hepatic and steroidogenic SR-B1s are also subject to posttranscriptional and posttranslational regulation. The scaffold protein PDZK1/NHERF3 is a regulator of hepatic SR-B1; it interacts with and helps to maintain SR-B1's optimal expression, cell surface localization, and selective transport function in (17Kocher O.

Moreover, previously, we provided evidence that two microRNAs, miR-125a and miR-455 inhibit HDL-supported steroid hormone production and downregulation of SR-B1 expression by directly binding to 3’ UTR region of SR-B1 mRNA in steroidogenic cells (5Hu Z.

Interestingly, the expression of both these miRNAs in steroidogenic tissues/cells is suppressed by trophic hormones and its second messenger cAMP resulting in increased expression and function of SR-B1 (20Shen W.J.

Three additional miRNAs, miR-185, miR-96, miRNA-24, and miR-223 also negatively regulate SR-B1 expression and function in the liver and macrophages (21Wang L. Jia X.J. Jiang H.J. Du Y. Yang F.

We further demonstrated that a salt-inducible kinase 1 (SIK1) positively regulates adrenal/gonadal steroidogenesis by stimulating the phosphorylation and activation of SR-B1 (24Hu Z.G. Hu J. Shen W.J. Kraemer F.B. Azhar S.

In an continuing effort to further enhance our understanding about the events connected with the posttranscriptional/posttranslational regulation of SR-B1 with a particular emphasis on the PDZ-domain containing proteins, we performed SR-B1 peptide pull-down/mass spectrometry (MS) assays, and identified that a novel PDZ protein, GIPC1, can physically interact with the intracellular tail of SR-B1 and elucidated the expression, function, and the structural organization of the GIPC1-SR-B1 complex in hepatocytes. GIPC1/GIPC (GAIP/RGS19-interacting protein C terminus), a single Postsynaptic density 95, Disks large, Zona occludens-1 (PDZ) domain adaptor protein, is a founding member of GIPC family, which also includes GIPC2 and GIPC3 (25Katoh M. GIPC gene family (review).Int. J. Mol. Med. 2002; 9: 585-589PubMed Google Scholar).The central PDZ domain of GIPC1 binds type I C-terminal PDZ-binding motifs (PBMs) confirming to the consensus sequence (S/T)-X-A/V/L/I (26Carretero-Ortega J. Chhangawala Z. Hunt S. Narvaez C. Menendez-Gonzalez J. Gay C.M. Zygmunt T. Li X. Torres-Vazquez J. GIPC proteins negatively modulate Plexind1 signaling during vascular development.Elife. 2019; 8e30454Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). GPIC1 also contains GIPC homology domains at their amino (GH1) and carboxyl (GH2) ends. The GH1 domain promotes self-dimerization, whereas the GH2 domain binds the globular domain of actin-based retrograde motor, MYOSIN6 (MYO6) driving endocytic vesicle internalization (26Carretero-Ortega J. Chhangawala Z. Hunt S. Narvaez C. Menendez-Gonzalez J. Gay C.M. Zygmunt T. Li X. Torres-Vazquez J. GIPC proteins negatively modulate Plexind1 signaling during vascular development.Elife. 2019; 8e30454Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). GIPC1 is in one of the most versatile PDZ proteins known to date, with a large number of binding partners, most of which are trans-membrane receptors, adhesion molecules, or proteins involved in endocytosis and trafficking of intracellular organelles (27Yi Z. Petralia R.S. Fu Z. Swanwick C.C. Wang Y.X. Prybylowski K. Sans N. Vicini S. Wenthold R.J. The role of the PDZ protein GIPC in regulating NMDA receptor trafficking.J.

Pharmacol. 2015; 88: 624-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Our analysis indicates that GIPC1 interacts with hepatic SR-B1, upregulates its protein levels by promoting SR-B1 protein stability, and specifically controls the selective HDL-cholesterol function of SR-B1 in hepatocytes. Our data further reveal a critical role for GIPC1-SR-B1 cross talk in the regulation of hepatic lipid metabolism and cholesterol homoeostasis. To explore the proteins that interact with SR-B1 and regulate SR-B1 function in hepatocyte, a biotin-labeled peptide containing C-terminal domain of mouse SR-B1 (Shanghai Bootech BioScience & Technology Co, Ltd) was incubated with mouse liver followed by incubation with streptavidin-agarose beads. Captured proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and separated bands were visualized by silver staining. Then the captured proteins were subjected to LC/MS assay (Fig. 1A). Analysis of the excised proteins by LC/MS identified GIPC1 as a binding partner of SR-B1. In addition, we detected the presence of PDZK1/NHERF3, a well-characterized hepatic SR-B1 interacting protein (see also Table S1) (18Trigatti B.L. SR-B1 and PDZK1: Partners in HDL regulation.Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 2017; 28: 201-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE/western blot analysis of pull-down samples probed with anti-GIPC1 demonstrated that Biotin-mCT45 interacts with endogenous GIPC1 present in liver extracts (Fig. 1B). Co-IP and western blotting experiments using liver extracts containing endogenous GIPC1 or cell extracts prepared from GIPC1 overexpressing cells further confirmed the specific interaction between SR-B1 and GIPC1 (Fig. 1, C–F). As noted above, GIPC family members including GIPC1 contain an amino-terminal GIPC homology 1 (GH1) domain, a central PDZ domain, and a carboxyl terminal GH2 domain (28Katoh M. Functional proteomics, human genetics and cancer biology of GIPC family members.Exp. Mol. Med. 2013; 45e26Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). To identify which of these domains are required for GIPC1 targeting to SR-B1, we generated a series of domain-deletion constructs of GIPC1 and expressed them in HEK293, a human embryonic kidney cell line (Fig. 1G, left). Co-IP and western blotting results indicated that PDZ domain was essential for GIPC1-association with SR-B1 (Fig. 1G, right). In contrast, GIPC1 constructs lacking either N-terminal or C-terminal domain showed no effect on GIPC1 targeting to SR-B1. The different truncated SR-B1 was also constructed and cotransfected with GIPC1 into HEK293 cells for co-IP analysis (Fig. 1H, left). Interestingly, deletion of either C-terminal domain or N-terminal domain of SR-B1 had no effect on its ability to interact with GIPC1 (Fig. 1H, right). We and others previously reported that PDZ proteins, PDZK1/NHERF3, NHERF1, and NHERF2, can interact with SR-B1 and regulate its protein levels and modulate SR-B1-mediated selective HDL-CE transport function in model hepatocyte cell lines (13Lu X.

Given this and the fact that GIPC1 can regulate cellular protein levels by interacting with the target proteins and modulating their cellular trafficking or degradation (30Wieman H.L. Horn S.R. Jacobs S.R. Altman B.J. Kornbluth S. Rathmell J.C. An essential role for the Glut1 PDZ-binding motif in growth factor regulation of Glut1 degradation and trafficking.Biochem.

Chem. 2001; 276: 33419-33427Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), we next elucidated whether GIPC1 interaction with SR-B1 modulates its expression and/or function. HEK293 cells were transfected with SR-B1 ± GIPC1 cDNA constructs. Western blotting of cellular extracts demonstrated that overexpression of GIPC1 was associated with enhanced expression of SR-B1 protein levels in cellular extracts from SR-B1 and GIPC1 cotransfected HEK293 cells (Fig. 2A). There is nearly no detected SR-B1 in HEK293 cell, and the concentration of overexpressed SR-B1 in HEK293 cell is about threefold to its physiological concentrations in Hepa 1 to 6 cell, whereas the overexpression of GIPC1 is about twofold to its physiological concentrations in HEK293 cells (data not shown). We next examined the effect of GPIC1 on the selective HDL-C transport function of SR-B1. Results presented in Figure 2B indicate that overexpression of GIPC1 leads to upregulation of SR-B1-mediated Dil-HDL-CE uptake (Fig. 2B). We next determined the impact of GIPC1 on the expression of various truncated forms of SR-B1 constructs. Overexpression of GIPC1 upregulated the expression of all SR-B1 constructs (i.e., SR-B1-1-464, 1-474, 1-504, and 9-509) with the exception of SR-B1-9-464 (Fig. 2C). These results are in agreement with the co-IP data shown above in Figure 1H. In comparison to wild-type GPIC1, GPIC1 constructs lacking either PDZ domain or GH1 domain were severely impaired in their abilities to upregulate the expression of SR-B1 (Fig. 2D). Our previous studies demonstrated that the protein levels of SR-B1 were degraded in a time-dependent manner following cycloheximide (CHX) inhibition of cellular protein synthesis (13Lu X. He L.F. Zhou Q. Wang M.N. Shen W.J. Azhar S. Pan F.Y. Guo Z.G. Hu Z.G. NHERF1 and NHERF2 regulation of SR-B1 stability via ubiquitination and proteasome degradation.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2017; 490: 1168-1175Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Therefore, we investigated whether the GIPC1 regulates SR-B1 protein levels by modulating SR-B1 protein stability. HEK293 cells were transfected with SR-B1 ± GIPC1 constructs for 36 h and cells were then treated with CHX. Protein levels were measured at different time points by western blotting. These data demonstrated that overexpression of GIPC1 stabilizes cellular SR-B1 protein levels (Fig. 2, E and F). Next, we sought to determine protein degradation pathway whose function is inhibited by the GPIC1 and in turn leads to increased SR-B1 protein stability. Mouse hepatoma Hepa 1 to 6 cells and mouse primary hepatocyte cells were treated with leupeptin hemisulfate (Leu, lysosomal proteolysis inhibitor), MG-132 (proteasome inhibitor), or chloroquine diphosphate (autophagy inhibitor, block the fusion of the autophagosome with the lysosome), respectively. Both MG-132 treatment and Leu treatment upregulated SR-B1 protein levels in Hepa 1 to 6 cells, whereas chloroquine treatment had no effect on SR-B1 expression (Fig. 2G). Similar results were obtained using primary mouse hepatocytes (Fig. 2G). The coexpression of SR-B1 with GIPC1 in HEK293 cells or treatment of SR-B1 expressing HEK293 cells with MG-132 cells significantly enhanced the SR-B1 protein levels. However, MG-132 had no effect on the GIPC1-enhanced SR-B1 protein expression (Fig. 2H). Leu treatment also enhanced SR-B1 protein levels in SR-B1 overexpressing HEK293 cells and further upregulated the SR-B1 protein levels in HEK293 cells coexpressing SR-B1 and GPIC1 (Fig. 2I). These results indicate that GIPC1 upregulates SR-B1 protein levels by improving the protein stability via the negative regulation of proteasomal and lysosomal protein degradation pathways. We next investigated whether GIPC1 is involved in the regulation of hepatic SR-B1 expression and lipid metabolism in a mouse hepatoma cell line (Hepa 1–6 cells) and primary mouse hepatocytes. Overexpression of GIPC1 enhanced SR-B1 protein levels without causing any significant changes in the SR-B1 mRNA levels (Fig. 3, A–C). We next measured the effect of increased expression of GIPC1 on SR-B1-mediated HDL-lipid uptake in cells using HDL-labeled with DiI lipophilic fluorescent dye probe (DiI-HDL) (Fig. 3D). In cells expressing GIPC1, the uptake of DiI-HDL was significantly increased as compared with control cells. We also examined the effect of increased expression of GIPC1, in this case measuring cellular lipid content using fluorescent neutral lipid dye, BODIPY 493/503 (4,4-difluoro-1,3,5,7,8-pentamethyl-4-bora-3a,4a-diaza-s-indacene) (catalog # D3922, Thermo Fisher Scientific). As shown in Figure 3E, cells overexpressing GIPC1 showed increased accumulation of neutral lipids. In addition, cellular TG and TC levels were also increased in GIPC1 expressing Hepa 1 to 6 cells and mouse primary hepatocytes (Fig. 3, F and G). All the genes whose protein products participate in lipid and cholesterol metabolism that we quantified by qRT-PCR showed no changes in response to increased GIPC1 expression; only mRNA levels of Scd1 were decreased modestly in GIPC1 expressing cells (Fig. 3H). To further confirm the stimulatory effect of GIPC1 on SR-B1 expression and lipid metabolism, we knocked down GIPC1 expression in Hepa 1 to 6 cells using two different GIPC1 short hairpin RNA 1 and 2 (shRNA1 and shRNA2) and then measured various lipid-related metabolic parameters (Fig. 4, A–F). The SR-B1 protein reduced to 29.5% and 33.2% of control level for the cells treated with GIPC1 shRNA1 or shRNA2, respectively. However, we did not detect a reduction in the mRNA levels of SR-B1 in cells treated with GIPC1 shRNAs (Fig. 4, A and B). Knockdown of GIPC1 in Hepa 1 to 6 cells also diminished both Dil-HDL uptake and neutral lipid accumulation (Fig. 4, C and D). Analysis of cellular lipid content revealed that in comparison to cells treated with the control shRNA, cells demonstrated reduced DiI-HDL uptake, lipid accumulation, and TG and cholesterol levels, when GIPC1 levels were reduced by shRNAs treatment (Fig. 4, C–F). Several enzyme genes whose protein products catalyze fatty acid, cholesterol, and triglyceride synthesis, including Acc1, Fasn, Scd1, Gpat1, Dgat1, and Hmgcr were significantly decreased by knocking down GIPC1 expression, whereas two genes that participate in fatty acid β-oxidation, Cpt1a and Cpt2, exhibited no significant changes (Fig. 4G). Collectively, these data demonstrate that GIPC1 both enhances the SR-B1 protein levels and potentiates cellular lipid uptake and accumulation. We assessed the effects of GIPC1 silencing (by administration of Ad-GIPC1 shRNA to mice vial tail vein) on SR-B1 expression and lipid metabolism. The qRT-PCR measurements indicated that administration of Ad-GIPC1 shRNA via tail-vein injection to mice is highly effective in silencing the expression of endogenous hepatic GIPC1 (Fig. 5A). Next, we used western blotting to evaluate hepatic SR-B1 protein expression. GIPC1 silencing induced a loss of SR-B1 protein expression (Fig. 5B). Likewise, hepatic TG and TC content and hepatic high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) were downregulated with GIPC1 suppression (Fig. 5, C–F). In contrast, plasma levels of TG, TC, HDL-C, and LDL-C were increased in Ad-GIPC1 shRNA-treated mice (Fig. 5, G–J). Interestingly, the mRNA levels of SR-B1 decreased in the liver samples from mice treated with Ad-GIPC1 (Fig. 5H). The mRNA levels of Scd1, Dgat1, Hmgcr, Hmgcs1, and Cpt1a were downregulated in liver samples of GIPC1 knockdown mice as compared with data obtained using control mice. Acc1, Fasn, Gpat1, and Cpt2 mRNA levels, however, exhibited no significant changes. These findings demonstrate that GIPC1 regulation of hepatic SR-B1 and lipid metabolism is quite different and complex between in vitro versus in vivo conditions. To further evaluate the functional interaction between GIPC1 and SR-B1, we carried out translational studies using liver samples collected from 32 obese and nonobese subjects at the time of surgery to remove the liver hemangioma (Table S2). As shown in Figure 6A, a negative correlation was observed between Gipc1 mRNA levels and the BMI of obese subjects (R = −0.6014 and p = 0.0003, Fig. 6A). Similarly, the expression of Scarb1 mRNA was also negatively correlated with the BMI of obese subjects (R = −0.5333 and p = 0.0017, Fig. 6B). In addition, GIPC1 and Scarb1 mRNA levels showed a positive association (R = 0.7954, p < 0.0001, Fig. 6C). Based on these findings, we performed similar studies using two mouse models of obesity: the high-fat diet (HFD)-fed mice and ob/ob mice. As shown in Figure 6D, feeding an HFD to mice suppressed the protein levels of both GIPC1 and SR-B1. Likewise, protein levels of both GIPC1 and SR-B1 were significantly attenuated in the liver samples of ob/ob mice as compared with wild-type control mice (Fig. 6E). We demonstrate here that the PDZ protein, GIPC1 interacts with SR-B1 and is mediated through the PDZ domain of GIPC. Changes in GIPC1 expression by overexpression of GIPC1 or reduction by GIPC-shRNA significantly affect SR-B1 expression, SR-B1-mediated selective HDL-cholesterol transport function, and SR-B1-linked hepatic lipid metabolism. Furthermore, we found that hepatic mRNA levels of both Scarb1 and Gipc1 are negatively correlated with the BMI of obese subjects. Likewise, hepatic protein levels of both GIPC1 and SR-B1 are suppressed in HFD-fed mice and ob/ob mice. Taken together, our results provide evidence that another PDZ protein, GIPC1 in addition to NHERF1, NHERF2, and PDZK1/NHERF3 plays a major regulatory role in the expression and function of hepatic SR-B1. SR-B1, an HDL receptor, is the most abundant lipoprotein receptor in high cholesterol requiring tissues, such as the liver, adrenal glands, and gonads (1Shen W.J. Azhar S. Kraemer F.B.

SR-B1 mediates the selective delivery of cholesterol esters and cholesterol from circulating HDL particles to the steroidogenic cells of the adrenal gland and gonads for steroid hormone production (1Shen W.J.

Zhou Q. Wang M.N. Shen W.J. Azhar S. Pan F.Y. Guo Z.G. Hu Z.G. NHERF1 and NHERF2 regulation of SR-B1 stability via ubiquitination and proteasome degradation.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2017; 490: 1168-1175Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). PDZ protein, PDZK1/NHERF3, is a major posttranslational regulator of hepatic SR-B1 but not steroidogenic SR-B1; it is required for the optimal expression of hepatic SR-B1 its cell surface localization and consequently, selective HDL-cholesterol transport function of SR-B1 (17Kocher O. Krieger M. Role of the adaptor protein PDZK1 in controlling the HDL receptor SR-BI.Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 2009; 20: 236-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). In addition, our previous studies identified two other PDZ family member of proteins, NHERF1 and NHERF2, that negatively regulate expression and function of both steroidogenic and hepatic SR-B1s via inhibition of their de novo synthesis and promote their increased ubiquitination/proteasomal degradation (13Lu X.

Chem. 2013; 288: 11416-11435Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). All these three PDZ proteins interact with hepatic SR-B1 and exhibit posttranslational modulation of SR-B1 at the protein level (only NHERF1 and NHERF2 also carry out these negative functions against steroidogenic SR-B1). GIPC1 is one of most versatile PDZ proteins known to date, with a large number of binding partners with a range of metabolic and functional implications including regulating cell surface receptor expression, intracellular trafficking of proteins and receptors, anchoring proteins at specific subcellular compartments, and signaling transduction (27Yi Z. Petralia R.S. Fu Z. Swanwick C.C. Wang Y.X. Prybylowski K. Sans N. Vicini S. Wenthold R.J. The role of the PDZ protein GIPC in regulating NMDA receptor trafficking.J.

Pharmacol. 2015; 88: 624-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). GIPC has also been shown to interact with other proteins including MYO6, integrin α5 subunit, and α-actinin-1. GIPC1 is involved in receptor trafficking and stabilization by protein–protein interaction with a variety of PDZ ligands, such as IGF1R, GLUT1, and NRP1 (28Katoh M. Functional proteomics, human genetics and cancer biology of GIPC family members.Exp. Mol. Med. 2013; 45e26Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The N-terminal portion of GIPC1 mediates its oligomerization, whereas its C-terminal region binds motor protein like MYO6. The central PDZ domain of GIPC1 can bind the C-terminal consensus (S/T)-X-A/V/L/I sequence of its regulating proteins (28Katoh M. Functional proteomics, human genetics and cancer biology of GIPC family members.Exp. Mol. Med. 2013; 45e26Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Our studies suggest that GIPC1 construct lacking PDZ domain loses its ability to bind to SR-B1. We also identified several motor proteins including MYO6 as the putative SR-B1-interacting proteins by pull-down/MS assays (Table S1). The related studies demonstrated that overexpression of GIPC1 upregulated both endogenous and ectopic expression of SR-B1 protein levels. These results are consistent with observations that GIPC1 is necessary for recycling and cell-surface expression of transmembrane receptors, such as IGF1R and TGFβR3 (28Katoh M. Functional proteomics, human genetics and cancer biology of GIPC family members.Exp. Mol. Med. 2013; 45e26Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 31Ligensa T. Krauss S. Demuth D. Schumacher R.

The studies presented in this article demonstrate the direct interaction of PDZ protein, GIPC1 with SR-B1, functions to upregulate the SR-B1 protein expression and SR-B1-mediated selective HDL-cholesterol transport in mouse liver cells. Gain and loss-of-function strategies further demonstrated that GIPC1 positively impacts cellular SR-B1 levels in both mouse model hepatic cell line (Hepa 1–6 cells) and primary hepatocytes. The TG and TC levels were attenuated by GIPC1-shRNA-mediated inhibition of GIPC1 expression, whereas overexpression of GIPC1 enhanced their cellular TG and TC levels. Several genes involved in hepatic lipid metabolism, including Acc1 and Fasn, were altered in response to decreased expression of GIPC1. Silencing of GIPC1 in mouse liver in vivo was associated with increased serum levels of TG and TC, and decreased hepatic TG and TC content, and loss of SR-B1 in hepatocyte. Translational human studies indicated a negative correlation between hepatic GIPC1 expression and BMI of obese subjects. In addition, the expression of Gipc1 was positively correlated with the Scarb1 mRNA levels in human liver samples. These findings are also in close agreement with the data obtained using two mouse models of obesity: the HFD-fed mice and ob/ob mice. Feeding an HFD to mice inhibited the protein levels of both GIPC1 and SR-B1. Similarly, GIPC1 and SR-B1 protein levels were also attenuated in the livers of ob/ob mice compared with wild-type control mice. Overall these data suggest that GIPC1 modulation of SR-B1 expression and function may be another mechanism by which hepatic cells regulate their lipid metabolism including cholesterol metabolism. As noted above, PDZK1 stabilizes SR-B1 through a protein–protein interaction, whereas NHERF1 and NHERF2 regulate its protein levels by promoting protein degradation via ubiquitination pathway (13Lu X.

Having established that GIPC1 upregulates the SR-B1 protein levels, we wished to determine whether GIPC1 does so by retarding the SR-B1 protein decay. To address this, HEK293 cells overexpressing SR-B1 and SR-B1 + GIPC1 were treated with CHX to arrest the cytosolic protein synthesis (translation), and subsequently, cell samples collected immediately and at different time points were analyzed for SR-B1 protein levels by western blotting. The half-life of SR-B1 was increased significantly in cells coexpressing SR-B1 and GIPC1 as compared with cells overexpressing SR-B1 alone. Furthermore, we found that treatment of hepatic cells with a proteasome inhibition, MG-132 or lysosome inhibitor, leupeptin hemisulfate enhanced SR-B1 protein levels in Hepa 1 to 6 cells, mouse primary hepatocytes, and HEK-293 cells overexpressing SR-B1 and GIPC1 (Fig. 2G), suggesting that SR-B1 protein degradation is achieved by both proteasome and lysosomal pathways. Interestingly, expression of GIPC1 showed a slightly elevated levels of SR-B1 protein in cells treated with MG-132 or Leu, indicating that GIPC1 regulation of SR-B1 may also involve blocking SR-B1 degradation via proteasome and lysosomal pathways. Taken together, these data strongly argue that SR-B1 interacting PDZ protein, GIPC1 is necessary for optimal expression and function of SR-B1 and that SR-B1 and GIPC1 work in concert to positively regulate hepatic cholesterol and lipid metabolism in vitro and in vivo. Interventions aimed at GIPC1-mediated increased expression of SR-B1 and/or SR-B1-linked regulation of hepatic cholesterol and lipid metabolism may prove effective in improving the health of the patients with dyslipidemia including hypercholesterolemia."

Divergence analysis transforms each entry of a high-dimensional omics profile into a digitized (binary or ternary) code based on the deviation of the entry from a given baseline population. This is a novel framework that is significantly different from existing omics data analysis methods: it allows digitization of continuous omics data at the univariate or multivariate level, facilitates sample level analysis, and is applicable on many different omics platforms. The divergence package, available on the R platform through the Bioconductor repository collection, provides easy-to-use functions for carrying out this transformation. Here we demonstrate how to use the package with data from the Cancer Genome Atlas."
https://openalex.org/W3149995846,"Despite current pharmacological intervention strategies, patients with HIV still suffer from chronic inflammation. The nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) are widely distributed throughout the nervous and immune systems. In macrophages, activation of alpha7-nAChR (α7-nAChR) controls inflammatory processes through the cholinergic anti-inflammatory response (CAR). Given that this innate immune response controls inflammation and α7-nAChR plays a critical role in the regulation of systemic inflammation, we investigated the effects of an R5-tropic HIV soluble component, gp120JRFL, on the CAR functioning. We previously demonstrated that X4-tropic HIV-1 gp120IIIB disrupts the CAR as well as inducing upregulation of the α7-nAChR in vitro in monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs), which correlates with the upregulation observed in monocytes, T-lymphocytes, and MDMs recovered from HIV-infected people. We demonstrate here using imaging and molecular assays that the R5-tropic HIV-1 glycoprotein gp120JRFL upregulates the α7-nAChR in MDMs dependent on CD4 and/or CCR5 activation. This upregulation was also dependent on MEK1 since its inhibition attenuates the upregulation of α7-nAChR induced by gp120JRFL and was concomitant with an increase in basal calcium levels, which did not result in apoptosis. Moreover, the CAR was determined to be disrupted, since α7-nAChR activation in MDMs did not reduce the production of the proinflammatory cytokines IL-6, GRO-α, or I-309. Furthermore, a partial antagonist of α7-nAChR, bupropion, rescued IL-6 but not GRO-α or I-309 production. Together, these results demonstrate that gp120JRFL disrupts the CAR in MDMs. Other medications targeting the α7-nAChR need to be tested to reactivate the CAR to ameliorate inflammation in HIV-infected subjects.

Worldwide, approximately 36.7 million people are HIV-positive, with 1.8 million new cases reported and 1.0 million AIDS-related deaths in 2016 alone (http://www.unaids.org/en/topic/data). The human immune deficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) accomplishes cell entry by direct interaction between the viral envelope glycoproteins gp120 and gp41 with the CD4 receptor present in the host's target cells. This interaction results in conformational changes on the gp120-CD4 receptor complex, enabling the virus to interact with either the CXCR4 coreceptor or CCR5 and culminating in the gp41-mediated fusion between the viral envelope to finally infect the target cell (1Berger E.A.

Macrophages are one of the key HIV-1-targeted cells that can be infected by M-tropic strains through the CCR5 (R5-tropic strain) coreceptor or by dual-tropic (X4/R5) strains that use both coreceptors for cell infection (2Goodenow M.M.

Association of the CCR5delta32 mutation with clinical response and >5-year survival following initiation of first triple antiretroviral regimen.Antivir. Ther. 2005; 10: 849-853PubMed Google Scholar). Importantly, because HIV-1 M-tropic strains (R5 strains) appear to play an essential role in HIV spread (4Rana S. Besson G. Cook D.G. Rucker J. Smyth R.J. Yi Y. Turner J.D. Guo H.H. Du J.G.

Vassart G. et al.Role of CCR5 in infection of primary macrophages and lymphocytes by macrophage-tropic strains of human immunodeficiency virus: Resistance to patient-derived and prototype isolates resulting from the delta ccr5 mutation.J. Virol. 1997; 71: 3219-3227Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), it is crucial to understand how signaling triggered by soluble viral constituents (e.g., gp120), acting through the CCR5 receptor, affects the inflammatory phenotype of macrophages, and how these cells could be targeted pharmacologically to activate an innate anti-inflammatory mechanism, called the cholinergic anti-inflammatory response (CAR), to treat the chronic inflammation suffered by HIV-infected subjects. Since 2000, special attention has been paid to the CAR as an innate neuroimmune mechanism that regulates and controls excessive inflammation. This is a prototypical neural circuit activated peripherally by cytokines and inflammatory products (5Wang H. Yu M. Ochani M. Amella C.A. Tanovic M. Susarla S. Li J.H. Wang H. Yang H. Ulloa L. Al-Abed Y. Czura C.J. Tracey K.J.

Controlling inflammation: The cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway.Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2006; 34: 1037-1040Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). This anti-inflammatory mechanism is dependent on the signal transduction via macrophages alpha7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (α7-nAChR), which binds acetylcholine (ACh) to inhibit the production of inflammatory cytokines without altering IL-10 levels (7Borovikova L.V. Ivanova S. Zhang M. Yang H. Botchkina G.I. Watkins L.R. Wang H. Abumrad N. Eaton J.W. Tracey K.J. Vagus nerve stimulation attenuates the systemic inflammatory response to endotoxin.Nature. 2000; 405: 458-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (2693) Google Scholar). Although there is robust evidence on the benefits of activating this anti-inflammatory mechanism to counteract inflammation, in the field of HIV there are practically no studies focused on this topic except for evidence recently reported by our group (8Delgado-Vélez M. Báez-Pagán C.A. Gerena Y. Quesada O. Santiago-Pérez L.I. Capó-Vélez C.M. Wojna V. Meléndez L. León-Rivera R. Silva W. Lasalde-Dominicci J.A. The α7-nicotinic receptor is upregulated in immune cells from HIV-seropositive women: Consequences to the cholinergic anti-inflammatory response.Clin. Transl. Immunol. 2015; 4: e53Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Indeed, studies performed in our laboratory using the X4-derived viral envelope gp120IIIB show that activation of the CXCR4 by this viral glycoprotein increases the expression of α7-nAChR in human monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) (8Delgado-Vélez M.

The cholinergic anti-inflammatory response and the role of macrophages in HIV-induced inflammation.Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2018; 191473Crossref Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Interestingly, this upregulation was also observed in T-lymphocytes, monocytes, and macrophages from HIV-infected patients (8Delgado-Vélez M. Báez-Pagán C.A. Gerena Y. Quesada O. Santiago-Pérez L.I. Capó-Vélez C.M. Wojna V. Meléndez L. León-Rivera R. Silva W. Lasalde-Dominicci J.A. The α7-nicotinic receptor is upregulated in immune cells from HIV-seropositive women: Consequences to the cholinergic anti-inflammatory response.Clin. Transl. Immunol. 2015; 4: e53Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). However, in this upregulated setting, α7-nAChR activation failed to inhibit the production of the majority of proinflammatory cytokines in MDMs deliberately pre-exposed to gp120IIIB followed by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) challenges. These results suggest that gp120IIIB disrupts an innate immune response mechanism that controls inflammation in HIV-infected subjects, the CAR. Moreover, these results underscore the importance of better understanding the mechanism behind the gp120-induced α7-nAChR upregulation, which may be associated with an unresolved problem in the HIV field: chronic inflammation. Although important advances have been made concerning the consequences of the X4-tropic gp120IIIB on macrophage's α7-nAChR expression and the CAR (8Delgado-Vélez M. Báez-Pagán C.A. Gerena Y. Quesada O. Santiago-Pérez L.I. Capó-Vélez C.M. Wojna V. Meléndez L. León-Rivera R. Silva W. Lasalde-Dominicci J.A. The α7-nicotinic receptor is upregulated in immune cells from HIV-seropositive women: Consequences to the cholinergic anti-inflammatory response.Clin. Transl. Immunol. 2015; 4: e53Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), the repercussions of the R5-tropic gp120JRFL on the α7-nAChR expression and the CAR operation in MDMs are still unknown. In the current work, we found that gp120JRFL induced the upregulation of α7-nAChR in MDMs results that are consistent with those reported previously using gp120IIIB (8Delgado-Vélez M. Báez-Pagán C.A. Gerena Y. Quesada O. Santiago-Pérez L.I. Capó-Vélez C.M. Wojna V. Meléndez L. León-Rivera R. Silva W. Lasalde-Dominicci J.A. The α7-nicotinic receptor is upregulated in immune cells from HIV-seropositive women: Consequences to the cholinergic anti-inflammatory response.Clin. Transl. Immunol. 2015; 4: e53Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Also, α7-nAChR's baseline levels correlated with the magnitude of the observed upregulation. Moreover, the α7-nAChR upregulation was significantly reduced after blocking CCR5 and CD4 receptors, suggesting that stimulation of these receptors could lead to α7-nAChR upregulation in these cells. Furthermore, CCR5 endogenous agonists RANTES and MIP-1β also abrogated gp120JRFL-induced upregulation of α7-nAChR, suggesting that activation of CCR5 or CD4 could trigger α7-nAChR upregulation in human macrophages. Also, α7-nAChR upregulation was attenuated by a MEK1 inhibitor and did not depend on de novo protein synthesis. Moreover, we found that the addition of gp120JRFL to MDMs promoted higher basal calcium levels, but not apoptosis. These cellular and molecular results underscore the molecular complexity behind the gp120-induced α7-nAChR upregulation in MDMs. Of note, from the inflammation standpoint, we found a CAR disruption for cytokines IL-6, GRO-α, and I-309, but not for TNF-α. Additionally, treatment with bupropion, a partial antagonist of α7-nAChR, reestablished the CAR for only IL-6, not the other cytokines. To study the effects of the R5-tropic gp120JRFL on α7-nAChR's expression, MDMs were treated with different concentrations of gp120JRFL including those within the pathophysiological range (0.002–2.5 nM) found in HIV-infected patients (10Klasse P.J.

Binding assays were performed using Alexa-488-α-bungarotoxin (α-BuTX) to detect surface expression of α7-nAChR in MDMs upon gp120JRFL exposure (Fig. S1A). As shown in Figure 1A, gp120JRFL at different concentrations (0.15 and 150 nM) significantly increased binding of α-BuTX in MDMs, suggesting higher levels of α7-nAChR. Moreover, Figure 1B shows that following exposure to a pathophysiological concentration (0.15 nM) of gp120JRFL, there was a significant increase in α-BuTX binding in nine of the total 14 donors (p = 0.0134, 64%). Not all donors exhibited elevated levels of α7-nAChR, possibly owing to genetic variations (14Raff H.V. Picker L.J. Stobo J.D. Macrophage heterogeneity in man.

The α7-nicotinic receptor is upregulated in immune cells from HIV-seropositive women: Consequences to the cholinergic anti-inflammatory response.Clin. Transl. Immunol. 2015; 4: e53Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Also, the upregulation detected for α7-nAChR in MDMs was directly proportional to the baseline levels that each donor had (Fig. S2), similar to what has been previously reported for g120IIIB (8Delgado-Vélez M. Báez-Pagán C.A. Gerena Y. Quesada O. Santiago-Pérez L.I. Capó-Vélez C.M. Wojna V. Meléndez L. León-Rivera R. Silva W. Lasalde-Dominicci J.A.

Upregulation results were confirmed by immunoblot assays that also showed increased levels of α7-nAChR in gp120JRFL-treated MDMs (Fig. 1F). Since this study focused on the mechanism and effects of gp120JRFL-induced α7-nAChR upregulation in the inflammatory response of MDMs, from this point forward (Fig. 1) all analyses were done using donors who demonstrated α7-nAChR upregulation in their respective MDMs upon gp120JRFL exposure. Consistent with previous studies we found that, as shown in Figure 1C, treatment with X4-tropic gp120IIIB increased the levels of α-BuTX binding in MDMs (8Delgado-Vélez M. Báez-Pagán C.A. Gerena Y. Quesada O. Santiago-Pérez L.I. Capó-Vélez C.M. Wojna V. Meléndez L. León-Rivera R. Silva W. Lasalde-Dominicci J.A.

Immunol. 2015; 4: e53Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Notably, similar results were observed after treatment with a different R5-tropic glycoprotein, gp120JRFL (Fig. 1C) and gp120ADA (Fig. 1D). Furthermore, to demonstrate the selective binding of α-BuTX to the α7-nAChR, nicotine competitive assays were performed in upregulated MDMs. As expected, results showed that nicotine pretreatment significantly reduced α-BuTX binding (Fig. 1E). Lastly, the increase in α7-nAChR levels occurred preceded by a nonsignificant increase in Egr1 after 6 h of incubation with gp120JRFL (Fig. S3). Chemokine coreceptors, CXCR4 and CCR5, expressed on immune cells are important for HIV-1 virus entry into CD4 expressing cells. CCR5 is the principal coreceptor used by M-tropic strains (e.g., gp120JRFL) to infect macrophages while CXCR4 (e.g., gp120IIIB) is used by T-tropic virus strains to infect and replicate activated CD4+ T-lymphocytes and macrophages (17Yi Y.

Also, as mentioned, it has been shown that gp120IIIB, through CXCR4, induces α7-nAChR upregulation in MDMs while HIV-infected individuals exhibit elevated levels of α7-nAChR in their monocytes, T-lymphocytes, and MDMs (8Delgado-Vélez M.

Immunol. 2015; 4: e53Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Given these findings, we hypothesized that the CCR5 coreceptor could also be involved in the mechanism of gp120JRFL-mediated upregulation of α7-nAChR in MDMs. Details of the treatments are presented in Figure S1B. As shown in Figure 2, A and B, the therapeutic CCR5 antagonist maraviroc prevented the increase of α-BuTX binding induced by gp120JRFL. Similar results were obtained in MDMs pretreated with the CD4 receptor antagonist, 4,4′-diisothiocyanatostilbene-2,2′-disulfonic acid (DIDS) (Fig. 2, A and B). Interestingly, the CCR5 natural agonists MIP-1β and RANTES also prevented the increase in α-BuTX binding (Fig. 2, A and B), suggesting a reduction in the expression of surface α7-nAChR in MDMs. These suggest that gp120JRFL could potentially activate other mechanisms that also result in α7-nAChR upregulation. Together, these results highlight the importance of CD4 and CCR5 stimulation for the upregulation of α7-nAChR in MDMs. Based on these findings, we next sought to investigate whether the signaling cascades resulting from gp120JRFL addition, shown to be dependent on activation of CD4 and CCR5, activate MAPK signaling in MDMs. Previous findings have shown that the CXCR4 receptor agonist SDF-1α and gp120IIIB upregulate the Egr1 gene, a transcription factor of α7-nAChR (18Luo Y.

Neurosc. 1997; 17: 6554-6564Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To investigate further, we pretreated MDMs with PD98059, a highly selective inhibitor of MEK1, to prevent its activation (21Crews C.M. Alessandrini A. Erikson R.L. The primary structure of MEK, a protein kinase that phosphorylates the ERK gene product.Science. 1992; 258: 478-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (726) Google Scholar). Details of the treatments are presented in Figure S1C. Our results show that α7-nAChR upregulation was attenuated by PD98059 pretreatment (Fig. 3, A and B), suggesting that gp120JRFL requires MAPK activation to upregulate α7-nAChR in MDMs. Unexpectedly, the addition of PD98059 alone did not reduce α7-nAChR to control levels. Taken together, these results suggest that gp120JRFL interaction with the CCR5 receptor activates MAPK signaling, which may promote the transcription of α7-nAChRs. However, protein synthesis inhibition results showed that the increase in α7-nAChR surface expression did not depend on de novo protein synthesis, suggesting that gp120JRFL could be affecting the trafficking of previously synthetized α7-nAChRs pool to the plasma membrane. Based on our findings, it seems that gp120JRFL activates a signaling cascade that depends on both CD4 and CCR5 stimulation, which is critical for gp120JRFL-mediated upregulation of α7-nAChRs. Consequently, to evaluate the significance of CCR5 blockade in the CAR functioning, we used the therapeutic drug maraviroc. As mentioned, maraviroc prevented the α7-nAChR upregulation (Fig. 2B). Here, we tested whether blockade of CCR5 with maraviroc would help restore the CAR measuring cytokines produced by MDMs. Results showed that maraviroc did not reduce any of the cytokines measured (Fig. S4).

Considering that gp120JRFL can trigger intracellular calcium signaling in macrophages through CCR5 stimulation and that α7-nAChRs are highly permeable to calcium, we studied possible changes in calcium after gp120JRFL exposure (24Liu Q.H. Williams D.A. McManus C. Baribaud F. Doms R.W. Schols D. De Clercq E. Kotlikoff M.I. Collman R.G. Freedman B.D.

As shown in Figure 4, A and B, gp120JRFL induced a significant increase in calcium basal levels in MDMs; however, the addition of the chelating agent, EGTA, or adding α-BuTX (an α7-nAChR blocker) did not result in a significant difference compared with responses to gp120JRFL alone (Fig. 4B). Furthermore, acetylcholine (ACh)-induced calcium mobilization after gp120JRFL addition, in MDMs upregulated for α7-nAChR, was not observed (data not shown). These findings suggest that α7-nAChR upregulation did not trigger apoptosis of macrophages, which is consistent with the antiapoptotic signature observed in HIV-infected monocytes (26Cummins N.W.

Therefore, MDMs upregulated for the α7-nAChR did not undergo apoptosis upon ACh stimulation. Acute HIV-1 infection is associated with the induction of cytokine cascades, including interferon-α (IFN-α), interferon-γ (IFN-γ), inducible protein 10 (IP-10), TNF-α, IL-6, IL-10, and IL-15 (29Stacey A.R.

Virol. 2009; 83: 3719-3733Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar). As a consequence, HIV-infected patients experience sustained and chronic inflammation that affects their immune status (30Kedzierska K. Crowe S.M. Cytokines and HIV-1: Interactions and clinical implications.Antivir. Chem. Chemother. 2001; 12: 133-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Given the vital role of α7-nAChR in regulating innate immune responses through the CAR activation (31Hoover D.B. Cholinergic modulation of the immune system presents new approaches for treating inflammation.Pharmacol. Ther. 2017; 179: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), we evaluated the cytokine profile of MDMs upregulated for α7-nAChR. Secretion of cytokines (interleukins and chemokines) was measured in MDMs challenged with LPS and exposed to gp120JRFL (Fig. S1E). As expected, ACh reduced the release of proinflammatory cytokines in LPS-treated MDMs (Fig. 5, A and B; green bars) not exposed to gp120JRFL, indicating that the CAR is functional. Of note, ACh was able to reduce TNF-α production in LPS-treated MDMs upregulated for α7-nAChR (Fig. 5A) but not for IL-6. Also, as expected, CAR activation did not alter IL-10 levels (7Borovikova L.V. Ivanova S. Zhang M. Yang H. Botchkina G.I. Watkins L.R. Wang H. Abumrad N. Eaton J.W. Tracey K.J. Vagus nerve stimulation attenuates the systemic inflammatory response to endotoxin.Nature. 2000; 405: 458-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (2693) Google Scholar). In terms of chemokines, ACh did not reduce the production of either GRO-α or I-309 in LPS-treated MDMs exposed to gp120JRFL (Fig. 2B). Therefore, in the presence of gp120JRFL (α7-nAChR upregulation), a CAR disruption was observed for the majority of cytokines tested. Overall, these results suggest that gp120JRFL negatively affected the CAR functioning in MDMs, thereby contributing to the inflammatory state present in HIV-infected subjects. Considering that the α7-nAChR function is critical for proper CAR functioning (5Wang H. Yu M. Ochani M. Amella C.A. Tanovic M. Susarla S. Li J.H. Wang H. Yang H. Ulloa L. Al-Abed Y. Czura C.J.

Medullary thymic epithelial cells (mTECs), which account for the majority of TECs in adults, are critical for thymocyte selection and self-tolerance. CD74 is a nonpolymorphic transmembrane glycoprotein of major histocompatibility complex class II (MHCII) that is expressed in TECs. However, the exact role of CD74 in regulating the development of mTEC is poorly defined. In this research, we found that loss of CD74 resulted in a significant diminution in the medulla, a selective reduction in the cell number of mature mTECs expressing CD80 molecules, which eventually led to impaired thymic CD4+ T cell development. Moreover, RNA-sequence analysis showed that CD74 deficiency obviously downregulated the canonical nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB) signaling pathway in mTECs. Our results suggest that CD74 positively controls mTEC cellularity and maturation partially by activating the canonical NF-κB signaling pathway."

Such a situation distinguishes phosphoglycerate mutase (PGM) in nematodes (5Zhang Y. Foster J.M. Kumar S. Fougere M. Carlow C.K.

In all vertebrates, cofactor-dependent phosphoglycerate mutase (dPGM) is a 2, 3-bisphophoglycerate cofactor–utilizing homodimer consisting of 23-kDa subunits, while the parasitic enzyme is a 56-kDa monomer cofactor-independent enzyme consisting of a phosphatase domain connected by a flexible hinge to the phosphotransferase domain. The catalytic mechanism utilized by these isozymes is also remarkably distinct. In dPGM, an active site phosphohistidine (H10) equilibrates the phosphate between the 2 and 3 positions of glyceric acid, while in cofactor-independent phosphoglycerate mutase (iPGM), a transition metal ion–activated serine (S86) mediates the phosphate transfer (10Jedrzejas M.J.

RNA interference experiments designed to silence iPGM in Caenorhabditis elegans demonstrated embryonic and larval lethality in addition to morphological effects (5Zhang Y. Foster J.M. Kumar S.

This functional target validation study spurred high-throughput screening for small-molecule iPGM inhibitors as candidates for a drug development program. In that work, either C. elegans or B. malayi iPGM activity was coupled through enolase and pyruvate kinase to an lactate dehydrogenase-mediated NADH absorbance assay, which was then used to screen small-molecule library collections totaling ∼380,000 compounds (11Crowther G.J.

Cofactor-independent phosphoglycerate mutase from nematodes has limited druggability, as revealed by two high-throughput screens.PLoS Negl. Trop. Dis. 2014; 8e2628Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Unfortunately, with little more than several low potency (∼10 μM) metal-ion chelators, the outcome suggests small-molecule inhibitors of iPGM may be particularly challenging to develop. Interestingly, the catalytic mechanism of iPGM involves a dynamically formed interdomain active site that sequesters phosphoglycerate substrate electrostatically bound at the transferase domain surface (12Roychowdhury A. Kundu A. Bose M. Gujar A. Mukherjee S. Das A.K. Complete catalytic cycle of cofactor-independent phosphoglycerate mutase involves a spring-loaded mechanism.FEBS J. 2015; 282: 1097-1110Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). This catalytic process evolved to isomerize phosphoglycerate, a small, charged hydrophilic molecule, without the ligand-binding pockets often found in enzymes such as G protein-coupled receptors and kinases that are often exploited in drug discovery (13Roskoski R.

We therefore explored a different strategy to search for iPGM inhibitors based on vastly larger chemical space (>1012 structures), molecular rigidity, and complexity encompassed by nucleic acid–encoded cyclic peptide libraries (17Bashiruddin N.K. Suga H. Construction and screening of vast libraries of natural product-like macrocyclic peptides using in vitro display technologies.Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2015; 24: 131-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Using affinity selection to isolate and enrich mRNA-encoded macrocyclic peptides tightly bound to immobilized C. elegans iPGM, we discovered ipglycermide, a highly potent macrocyclic chemotype inhibitor of the enzyme and its nematode species orthologs (18Yu H. Dranchak P. Li Z. MacArthur R. Munson M.S. Mehzabeen N. Baird N.J. Battalie K.P. Ross D. Lovell S. Carlow C.K. Suga H. Inglese J.

Ipglycermide is a 14-amino acid peptide containing an 8-membered macrocycle formed through a thioether bridging the D-Tyr1 α-acetamide and Cys8 sulfhydryl (Fig. 1A). †In the text, the single-letter amino acid convention is used to denote protein residues and sequences, whereas the three-letter code is used in descriptions of the peptide macrocycles.†In the text, the single-letter amino acid convention is used to denote protein residues and sequences, whereas the three-letter code is used in descriptions of the peptide macrocycles. At the carboxyl terminus of ipglycermide, we proposed that the Cys14 thiol coordinates with a transition ion adjacent to the catalytic Zn2+-coordinated Ser86 of the enzyme based on the requirement of Cys14 for subnanomolar inhibition of C. elegans iPGM and modeling from the cocrystal structure of a truncated ipglycermide analog, Ce-2d (Fig. 1B), bound to C. elegans iPGM (18Yu H. Dranchak P. Li Z. MacArthur R. Munson M.S. Mehzabeen N. Baird N.J. Battalie K.P. Ross D. Lovell S. Carlow C.K. Suga H. Inglese J. Macrocycle peptides delineate locked-open inhibition mechanism for microorganism phosphoglycerate mutases.Nat. Commun. 2017; 8: 14932Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In the present study, we extend and refine our structural and mechanistic understanding of ipglycermide with affinity selection-based saturation mutagenesis, surface plasmon resonance (SPR) determination of binding kinetics, and new cocrystallographic insights from metal-ion–coordinated ipglycermides. These findings will aid in the development of analogs with broader pathogen iPGM selectivity and as chemical probes to study the biochemistry and regulation of iPGM in microbial glycolysis. Furthermore, we anticipate ipglycermide will serve as a useful macrocyclic peptide for the study of cell-permeable analogs and formulations having potential therapeutic applications. Recombinant expression of PGMs from human, nematode, and bacterial species previously allowed us to show (18Yu H. Dranchak P. Li Z. MacArthur R. Munson M.S. Mehzabeen N. Baird N.J. Battalie K.P.

Although nematode ortholog iPGM concentrations (≥1 nM) needed for robust enzymatic activity measurements are above the KD of the parent ipglycermide Ce-2 for nematode orthologs, apparent from the characteristic steep concentration responses (Fig. 1C, black curves (19Straus O.H. Goldstein A. Zone behavior of enzymes: Illustrated by the effect of dissociation constant and dilution on the system cholinesterase-physostigmine.J. Gen. Physiol. 1943; 26: 559-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar)), the lower-affinity Ce-2d ipglycermide core reveals an IC50 dependence on sequence differences among the orthologs (compare orange versus back curves in Fig. 1C). Furthermore, the low specific catalytic activity of Escherichia coli iPGM having 45% identity with C. elegans iPGM limits the ability to measure IC50 values below 50 nM for this enzyme, with Ce-2d showing no significant inhibition up to 30 μM. §We initially concluded Escherichia coli iPGM was potently inhibited by Ce-2d because of a mislabeled enzyme lot. The lot of enzyme labeled as “Ec iPGM” for E. coli iPGM was actually “Ce iPGM” (i.e., Caenorhabditis elegans iPGM), as later determined when E. coli iPGM prepared in our laboratory (J.I.) was not significantly inhibited by Ce-2d. MS-based sequence analysis subsequently confirmed the original sample was indeed C. elegans iPGM, not E. coli iPGM (Fig. S1). Repeated attempts to correct this in the published article (18Yu H. Dranchak P. Li Z. MacArthur R. Munson M.S. Mehzabeen N. Baird N.J. Battalie K.P. Ross D. Lovell S. Carlow C.K. Suga H. Inglese J. Macrocycle peptides delineate locked-open inhibition mechanism for microorganism phosphoglycerate mutases.Nat. Commun. 2017; 8: 14932Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) were unsuccessful. E. coli iPGM appears to demarcate the point in sequence similarity sensitive to the Ce-2d ipglycermide, whereas the enzyme activity of nematode orthologs tested (% sequence identity is between 71 and 75% of C. elegans) was stoichiometrically inhibited by Ce-2 and potently inhibited by Ce-2d (Fig. 1C). From the cocrystal structure of the ipglycermide Ce-2d analog bound to C. elegans iPGM, we observe that the ipglycermide core (residues 1–11) is a compact structure with an internal H-bond network strongly mediated by Asp6 (Fig. 1D and Table S1). Although Asp6 is largely shielded from contact with iPGM (Fig. 1E), the remaining ipglycermide residues engage the enzyme interdomain cavity primarily along the phosphatase surface through water-mediated hydrogen bonding with minimal hydrophobic interactions (Fig. 1F). To gain structural insight into the molecular interactions of the C-terminus of ipglycermides with iPGM, we established co-crystal structures using analogs, Ce-2 Tyr7Phe and Ce-1 Cys14NHOH (Ce-1 NHOH), respectively, retaining Cys14 or replacing it with NHOH, an oxidation-insensitive and solid-phase peptide synthesis (SPPS)-accessible metal-ion–coordinating ligand (20Kim B.K. Hong J.Y. An overview of naturally occurring histone deacetylase inhibitors.Curr. Top. Med. Chem. 2014; 14: 2759-2782Crossref Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 21Floyd C.D. Lewis C.N. Patel S.R.

Inhibition of leucine aminopeptidase by amino acid hydroxamates.J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 7955-7957Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Using our established crystallization conditions, supplemented with 2-mM tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine for Ce-2 Tyr7Phe–containing complexes, we were able to obtain crystals diffracting to 2.1 Å and 1.80 Å for Ce-2 Tyr7Phe and Ce-1 NHOH, respectively, bound to C. elegans iPGM (Table S2). The electron density maps for these complexes were clearly defined, and all atoms for the ipglycermides could be modeled except for the Ce-1 NHOH solvent-exposed Tyr11 side chain (Fig. S2). The “core” region of the peptide (Tyr1-Tyr11) forms hydrogen-bond interactions with N85, Q101, D102, and R289 like Ce-2d (Fig. S3 and Fig. 1F). Comparable hydrogen-bond interactions that were observed in iPGM⋅Ce-1 NHOH are present in the iPGM⋅Ce-2 Tyr7Phe structure (Fig. S4 and Table S3). The iPGM domain residues are nearly identical, and superposition yielded an RMSD of 0.24 Å between Cα atoms (Fig. 2A, 504 residues). Likewise, the Ce-1 NHOH and Ce-2 Tyr7Phe peptides adopt a similar binding mode (Fig. S4) in which residues 1 to 11 are positioned in nearly identical orientations to those for the C. elegans iPGM–Ce-2d complex (Protein Data Bank [PDB] ID: 5KGN) including water-mediated H-bonding (Fig. 1F and Table S3) and a coplanar orientation of the aromatic residue 7 substitutions, Tyr, Phe, and His, respectively, in Ce-2d, Ce-2 Tyr7Phe, and Ce-1 NHOH (Fig. 2A insert and Fig. S4). However, residues 12 to 14 of Ce-2 Tyr7Phe and Ce-1 NHOH display nonoverlapping conformations resulting from differences in Zn2+ coordination. The C-terminal Thr13-hydroxamate residue side chain forms an interaction with E87, which appears to constrain this portion of the peptide and permits a bidentate interaction from the carbonyl (2.15 Å) and hydroxyl (2.30 Å) to a Zn2+. In addition, the Thr13 hydroxyl forms a hydrogen bond with the active site S86 that is coordinated to the second Zn2+ (Fig. 2B). In the iPGM–Ce-2 Tyr7Phe complex, the Cys14-NH2 residue forms a monodentate interaction with the Zn2+ through the S atom (2.28 Å) as suggested by prior modeling using the C. elegans iPGM–Ce-2d complex (Fig. 2C) (18Yu H. Dranchak P. Li Z. MacArthur R. Munson M.S. Mehzabeen N. Baird N.J. Battalie K.P. Ross D. Lovell S. Carlow C.K. Suga H. Inglese J. Macrocycle peptides delineate locked-open inhibition mechanism for microorganism phosphoglycerate mutases.Nat. Commun. 2017; 8: 14932Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In addition, the Cys14-terminal amide NH2 group forms an intramolecular hydrogen bond with Tyr11 (Fig. 2C), possibly serving to brace and position the Cys14 thiolate. From this binding orientation, it can be envisioned how the nucleic acid attached to the C terminus of the original RNA-encoded ligand could be accommodated in the complex (Fig. S3B). The main change in the common sequence is observed for residue Thr13 that is displaced from the Zn2+ in iPGM–Ce-2 Tyr7Phe to accommodate the binding of Cys14. Notably, the sulfur atom of Cys14 is positioned in a nearly identical region as the Thr13/hydroxamate carbonyl in the iPGM⋅Ce-1 NHOH structure. Despite these conformational displacements, the Thr13 side-chain hydroxyl adopts a similar spatial position in both structures, thereby maintaining the hydrogen-bond interaction with the phosphatase domain E87 γ-carboxylate (Fig. S4). A comparative analysis of the apo–C. elegans iPGM structure (PBD ID: 5KGM) to that of the ipglycermide-bound forms (PDB ID: 5KGN, 7KNF, 7KNG) indicates the enzyme clamps the core by inward movement of the phosphotransferase and phosphatase domains by as much as 10 Å (Fig. 2, D and E). The movement would be consistent with the structural dynamics described for the catalytic mechanism of the Trypanosoma brucei and Staphylococcus aureus iPGM orthologs and observed motions of loops in other enzyme systems (12Roychowdhury A. Kundu A. Bose M. Gujar A. Mukherjee S. Das A.K.

We sought to resolve the composite contribution of the ipglycermide core and metal-coordinating substructures to affinity and ortholog selectivity by determining dissociation constants based on association and dissociation kinetics for Ce-2d versus Ce-2 and Ce-1 NHOH. Therefore, we measured binding kinetics and saturation binding using the activity-independent technique of SPR to develop a structure–interaction kinetic relationship among the ipglycermide analogs and iPGM orthologs. For conditional immobilization of the iPGMs to the sensor chip surface, we chose to use reversible biotin capture (25Niemeyer C.M. Ceyhan B. Blohm D. Functionalization of covalent DNA-streptavidin conjugates by means of biotinylated modulator components.Bioconjug. Chem. 1999; 10: 708-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Consequently, we prepared site-specific biotin-labeled iPGMs through biotin ligase BirA-catalyzed biotin transfer to a 14-amino acid accepter sequence added to the C terminus of C. elegans, B. malayi, and E. coli iPGMs (26Beckett D. Kovaleva E. Schatz P.J. A minimal peptide substrate in biotin holoenzyme synthetase-catalyzed biotinylation.Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 921-929Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar). For the sensorgram progress curves reaching the steady state (Fig. 3, A–C, F, H, and I), we calculated the KD from the hyperbolic fit to a single-site binding equation. However, where progress curves did not reach equilibrium during the longest injection, the KD was determined from the ratio of the rate constants and koff/kon determined from the experimental data (blue curves) globally fit to a 1:1 binding model (black curves). A qualitative inspection of the resulting sensorgrams in Figure 3 clearly demonstrates the codependence of the metal ion–coordinating and interdomain-binding substructures in modulating the off-rate of ipglycermide from the three iPGM orthologs. Although kon values between analogs and orthologs spanned a 450-fold range, koff between C. elegans iPGM–Ce-2d and E. coli iPGM–Ce-2d interaction was >106-fold, illustrating the predominating role of the off-rate on the KD. For each analog–iPGM binding interaction, a consistent trend in t½ can be observed, where Ce-2 Thr13Ser > Ce-2 > Ce-1 NHOH >> Ce-2d, respectively, for C. elegans, B. malayi, and E. coli iPGMs encompassing a KD range of over 5 orders of magnitude (Table 1). Req binding measured for Ce-2d at the iPGM orthologs gives KD values of 2.4 nM, 58 nM, and 6 μM for C. elegans, B. malayi, and E. coli iPGM, respectively, correlating well with the ∼40-fold ΔIC50 between C. elegans and B. malayi iPGM seen in the functional enzyme assays, while allowing us to measure an affinity on E. coli iPGM not possible with the limitations in the functional assay (Table 1 versus Fig. 1C). The KD for Ce-2 on C. elegans iPGM determined from the kon = 1.1 × 106 M−1s−1 and koff = 3.2 × 10−5 s−1 of 38 pM is within several folds of our prior estimate of 70 pM determined using a zone boundary analysis from a cross-titration of C. elegans iPGM enzyme versus Ce-2 (18Yu H.

Regarding the low specific activity of E. coli iPGM, the SPR-derived Ce-2 KD of ≈70 nM is consistent with an IC50 exceeding 100 nM in the functional assay requiring an enzyme concentration of 50 nM (Fig. 1C). Overall, KD values are well correlated with the IC50 values of those analog-iPGM pairs that could be reliably measured by the functional assay. Using SPR, we could obtain affinity values for all the interacting species tested, which for Ce-2 were delimited by the enzyme concentrations required in the functional assay (Fig. 1C, black curves).Table 1Rate and dissociation constants of ipglycermide analogs binding to iPGM orthologsIpglycermideiPGMkon (M−1s−1)koff (s−1)KDt½Ce-2dC. elegans2.1 × 1062.1 × 10−32.4 nM6 minCe-2C. elegans1.1 × 1063.2 × 10−538 pM6.7 hCe-1 NHOHC. elegans1.9 × 1067.8 × 10−5110 pM1.5 hCe-2 Thr13SerC. elegans2.9 × 1061.7 × 10−429 pM2.5 hCe-2dB. malayi5.3 × 1051.9 × 10−258 nM70 sCe-2B. malayi4.8 × 1052.2 × 10−40.5 nM52 minCe-1 NHOHB. malayi2.0 × 1051.5 × 10−312 nM7.9 minCe-2 Thr13SerB. malayi1.6 × 1067.8 × 10−585 pM2.7 hCe-2dE. coli>LoQ>LoQ6 μM≤1 sCe-2E. coli1.0 × 1054.8 × 10−369 nM2.4 minCe-1 NHOHE. coli>LoQ>LoQ5 μM≤1 sCe-2 Thr13SerE. coli2.4 × 1053.3 × 10−41.3 nM44 miniPGM, cofactor-independent phosphoglycerate mutase; LoQ, limit of quantitation.The SEM and % error are reported in Table S5.

The original in vitro selection yielding ipglycermide from trillions of possible cyclic peptides resulted in only two sequences, differing at a single position, Tyr7 (Ce-2) or His7 (Ce-1), as shown in Figure 1A (18Yu H. Dranchak P. Li Z. MacArthur R. Munson M.S. Mehzabeen N. Baird N.J. Battalie K.P. Ross D. Lovell S. Carlow C.K. Suga H. Inglese J. Macrocycle peptides delineate locked-open inhibition mechanism for microorganism phosphoglycerate mutases.Nat. Commun. 2017; 8: 14932Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Given this restricted structure–activity relationship, possibly resulting from the practical limitations in testing all possible sequence combinations, we elected to broadly investigate side-chain substitutions on ipglycermide using a variation of the original discovery approach (27Rogers J.M. Passioura T. Suga H. Nonproteinogenic deep mutational scanning of linear and cyclic peptides.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2018; 115: 10959-10964Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The Random Non-standard Peptide Integrated Discovery (RaPID) platform uses a combination of mRNA display coupled to in vitro translation, allowing incorporation of noncanonical amino acids via genetic code reprograming. Initiating translation with an electrophilic amino acid, N-chloroacetyl tyrosine, in lieu of methionine, facilitates macrocyclization via thiol-mediated nucleophilic substitution by cysteine subsequently incorporated within sterically permissible sequence positions (17Bashiruddin N.K. Suga H. Construction and screening of vast libraries of natural product-like macrocyclic peptides using in vitro display technologies.Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2015; 24: 131-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Here, the remaining proteinogenic amino acids and 4-fluorophenylalanine were used to create 280 single-site substitution analogs that evaluated side-chain variation at each of the 14 amino acid positions of the parent ipglycermide, Ce-2. C. elegans iPGM immobilized on magnetic beads was used to enrich the library for high-affinity binders. The frequency of positional substitutions after a single cycle of enrichment was determined by deep sequencing using the cognate reverse-transcribed PCR products and yielded the substitution tolerance. To calculate enrichment scores for each mutant (Fig. 4A, black circles), the fraction of DNA reads relative to the WT Ce-2 peptide sequence (red circles) was computed. Enrichment scores relative to the WT Ce-2 sequence highlight beneficial, neutral, or detrimental single mutations to natural or unnatural (X or (4F)F = 4-fluorophenylalanine) amino acids. The data are plotted as the log2 enrichment versus amino acid along the x-axis arranged roughly by hydrophobicity, aromaticity, and polarity/charge. Missing data (Fig. 4A, top panel: Y, W, C) indicate insufficient DNA reads were obtained for an enrichment calculation. RaPID scanning mutagenesis provided a broad and revealing structure–activity relationship analysis for ipglycermide and was used to guide subsequent SPPS of Ce-2 and Ce-2d analogs for further ortholog selectivity analysis in functional enzyme inhibition assays, binding kinetics, and cocrystal structural determinations. A salient finding of the RaPID scanning mutagenesis was that no single substitution displayed a major enrichment over Ce-2 for C. elegans iPGM, highlighting the power of the RaPID system for identifying high-affinity binders. However, depending on the l"
https://openalex.org/W3149700035,"Myelin plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of neurological disorders but is difficult to characterize in vivo using standard analysis methods. Our goal was to develop a novel analytical framework for estimating myelin content using T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) based on a de- and re-myelination model of multiple sclerosis. We examined 18 mice with lysolecithin induced demyelination and spontaneous remyelination in the ventral white matter of thoracic spinal cord. Cohorts of 6 mice underwent 9.4T MRI at days 7 (peak demyelination), 14 (ongoing recovery), and 28 (near complete recovery), as well as histological analysis of myelin and the associated cellularity at corresponding timepoints. Our MRI framework took an unsupervised learning approach, including tissue segmentation using a Gaussian Markov random field (GMRF), and myelin and cellularity feature estimation based on the Mahalanobis distance. For comparison, we also investigated 2 regression-based supervised learning approaches, one using our GMRF results, and another using a freely available generalized additive model (GAM). Results showed that GMRF segmentation was 73.2% accurate, and our unsupervised learning method achieved a correlation coefficient of 0.67 (top quartile: 0.78) with histological myelin, similar to 0.70 (top quartile: 0.78) obtained using supervised analyses. Further, the area under the receiver operator characteristic curve of our unsupervised myelin feature (0.883, 95% CI: 0.874–0.891) was significantly better than any of the supervised models in detecting white matter myelin as compared to histology. Collectively, metric learning using standard MRI may prove to be a new alternative method for estimating myelin content, which ultimately can improve our disease monitoring ability in a clinical setting."
