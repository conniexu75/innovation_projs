https://openalex.org/W2076154138,"The reference human genome sequence set the stage for studies of genetic variation and its association with human disease, but epigenomic studies lack a similar reference. To address this need, the NIH Roadmap Epigenomics Consortium generated the largest collection so far of human epigenomes for primary cells and tissues. Here we describe the integrative analysis of 111 reference human epigenomes generated as part of the programme, profiled for histone modification patterns, DNA accessibility, DNA methylation and RNA expression. We establish global maps of regulatory elements, define regulatory modules of coordinated activity, and their likely activators and repressors. We show that disease- and trait-associated genetic variants are enriched in tissue-specific epigenomic marks, revealing biologically relevant cell types for diverse human traits, and providing a resource for interpreting the molecular basis of human disease. Our results demonstrate the central role of epigenomic information for understanding gene regulation, cellular differentiation and human disease. This study describes the integrative analysis of 111 reference human epigenomes, profiled for histone modification patterns, DNA accessibility, DNA methylation and RNA expression; the results annotate candidate regulatory elements in diverse tissues and cell types, their candidate regulators, and the set of human traits for which they show genetic variant enrichment, providing a resource for interpreting the molecular basis of human disease. The goal of the NIH Roadmap Epigenomics Consortium was to generate a reference collection of human epigenomes for primary cells and tissues. This study describes the integrative analysis of 111 reference human epigenomes, profiled for histone modification patterns, DNA accessibility, DNA methylation and RNA expression. The results show that disease and trait-associated genetic variants are enriched in predicted tissue-specific epigenomic marks, revealing biologically relevant cell types for diverse human traits and providing a resource for interpreting the molecular basis of human disease."
https://openalex.org/W2080477348,"Higher-order chromatin structure is emerging as an important regulator of gene expression. Although dynamic chromatin structures have been identified in the genome, the full scope of chromatin dynamics during mammalian development and lineage specification remains to be determined. By mapping genome-wide chromatin interactions in human embryonic stem (ES) cells and four human ES-cell-derived lineages, we uncover extensive chromatin reorganization during lineage specification. We observe that although self-associating chromatin domains are stable during differentiation, chromatin interactions both within and between domains change in a striking manner, altering 36% of active and inactive chromosomal compartments throughout the genome. By integrating chromatin interaction maps with haplotype-resolved epigenome and transcriptome data sets, we find widespread allelic bias in gene expression correlated with allele-biased chromatin states of linked promoters and distal enhancers. Our results therefore provide a global view of chromatin dynamics and a resource for studying long-range control of gene expression in distinct human cell lineages. An analysis of genome-wide chromatin interactions during human embryonic stem cell differentiation reveals changes in chromatic organization and simultaneously identifies allele-resolved chromatin structure and differences in gene expression during differentiation. Higher-order chromatin structures are among the factors influencing gene expression, although how these structures evolve during differentiation and lineage specification in mammalian systems is still unclear. Bing Ren and colleagues have mapped the differences in genome-wide chromatin interactions between human embryonic stem cells and their differentiated progeny. They delineate biases in allelic gene expression that correlate with allele-biased chromatin interactions between distal enhancers and proximal promoters."
https://openalex.org/W2125805216,"Analysis of transcriptional and epigenomic changes in the hippocampus of a mouse model of Alzheimer’s disease shows that immune function genes and regulatory regions are upregulated, whereas genes and regulatory regions involved in synaptic plasticity, learning and memory are downregulated; genetic variants associated with Alzheimer’s disease are only enriched in orthologues of upregulated immune regions, suggesting that dysregulation of immune processes may underlie Alzheimer’s disease predisposition. Recent genome-wide association studies have shown substantial genetic variation in non-coding regions associated with Alzheimer's disease, suggesting the involvement of aberrant gene regulation. However, the functional significance of these variants remained unclear. By profiling transcriptional and chromatin state dynamics in a mouse model, Elizabeta Gjoneska and colleagues now show that the immune response genes and their regulatory regions are upregulated, whereas those involved in synaptic plasticity and learning and memory are downregulated. These changes are highly conserved between the mouse model and the human disease. Surprisingly, Alzheimer's disease-associated genetic variants are mainly enriched in higher-activity, immune-related enhancers, and are depleted in lower-activity, neural enhancers. This suggests that genetic predisposition to Alzheimer's may be primarily associated with immune functions, while neuronal plasticity may be affected primarily by non-genetic effects. Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a severe1 age-related neurodegenerative disorder characterized by accumulation of amyloid-β plaques and neurofibrillary tangles, synaptic and neuronal loss, and cognitive decline. Several genes have been implicated in AD, but chromatin state alterations during neurodegeneration remain uncharacterized. Here we profile transcriptional and chromatin state dynamics across early and late pathology in the hippocampus of an inducible mouse model of AD-like neurodegeneration. We find a coordinated downregulation of synaptic plasticity genes and regulatory regions, and upregulation of immune response genes and regulatory regions, which are targeted by factors that belong to the ETS family of transcriptional regulators, including PU.1. Human regions orthologous to increasing-level enhancers show immune-cell-specific enhancer signatures as well as immune cell expression quantitative trait loci, while decreasing-level enhancer orthologues show fetal-brain-specific enhancer activity. Notably, AD-associated genetic variants are specifically enriched in increasing-level enhancer orthologues, implicating immune processes in AD predisposition. Indeed, increasing enhancers overlap known AD loci lacking protein-altering variants, and implicate additional loci that do not reach genome-wide significance. Our results reveal new insights into the mechanisms of neurodegeneration and establish the mouse as a useful model for functional studies of AD regulatory regions."
https://openalex.org/W2086239585,"An analysis of cell-type-specific epigenomic features reveals a relationship between epigenomic and mutational profiles; chromatin characteristics can explain a large proportion of mutational variance in cancer genomes and the mutational distribution can identify the probable cell type from which a given cancer originated from. Genomic studies have shown that different cancer types vary substantially in the local density and types of somatic mutations. This has been explained not only by differences in DNA sequence but also by other features including epigenetic organization. Shamil Sunyaev and colleague now compare mutation densities to detailed epigenetic profiles of different cell types and tissues. They demonstrate that epigenomic features of a given cell type or tissue in which a cancer arises are much stronger determinants of mutational profiles than other properties. Conversely, the findings make it possible to deduce information on the possible tissue-of-origin of a tumour based on its mutational landscape. Cancer is a disease potentiated by mutations in somatic cells. Cancer mutations are not distributed uniformly along the human genome. Instead, different human genomic regions vary by up to fivefold in the local density of cancer somatic mutations1, posing a fundamental problem for statistical methods used in cancer genomics. Epigenomic organization has been proposed as a major determinant of the cancer mutational landscape1,2,3,4,5. However, both somatic mutagenesis and epigenomic features are highly cell-type-specific6,7. We investigated the distribution of mutations in multiple independent samples of diverse cancer types and compared them to cell-type-specific epigenomic features. Here we show that chromatin accessibility and modification, together with replication timing, explain up to 86% of the variance in mutation rates along cancer genomes. The best predictors of local somatic mutation density are epigenomic features derived from the most likely cell type of origin of the corresponding malignancy. Moreover, we find that cell-of-origin chromatin features are much stronger determinants of cancer mutation profiles than chromatin features of matched cancer cell lines. Furthermore, we show that the cell type of origin of a cancer can be accurately determined based on the distribution of mutations along its genome. Thus, the DNA sequence of a cancer genome encompasses a wealth of information about the identity and epigenomic features of its cell of origin."
https://openalex.org/W2102663142,"Pluripotent stem cells provide a powerful system to dissect the underlying molecular dynamics that regulate cell fate changes during mammalian development. Here we report the integrative analysis of genome-wide binding data for 38 transcription factors with extensive epigenome and transcriptional data across the differentiation of human embryonic stem cells to the three germ layers. We describe core regulatory dynamics and show the lineage-specific behaviour of selected factors. In addition to the orchestrated remodelling of the chromatin landscape, we find that the binding of several transcription factors is strongly associated with specific loss of DNA methylation in one germ layer, and in many cases a reciprocal gain in the other layers. Taken together, our work shows context-dependent rewiring of transcription factor binding, downstream signalling effectors, and the epigenome during human embryonic stem cell differentiation. Lineage-specific transcription factors and signalling pathways cooperate with pluripotency regulators to control the transcriptional networks that drive cell specification and exit from an embryonic stem cell state; here, we report genome-wide binding data for 38 transcription factors combined with analysis of epigenomic and gene expression data during the differentiation of human embryonic stem cells into the three germ layers. Lineage-specific transcription factors and signalling pathways cooperate with pluripotency regulators when cells exit the embryonic stem cell state and activate the transcriptional networks that control cell specification. Here, as part of the Epigenome Roadmap project, Meissner and colleagues report genome-wide binding data for 38 transcription factors — combined with analysis of epigenomic and gene expression data — during the differentiation of human embryonic stem cells into the three germ layers. They reveal the orchestrated changes in transcription factor binding during differentiation, such as key roles for GATA4 and OTX2 in the transition to mesoderm and ectoderm, respectively."

https://openalex.org/W1980022376,"Myelin ensheathes axons to allow rapid propagation of action potentials and proper nervous system function. In the peripheral nervous system, Schwann cells (SCs) radially sort axons into a 1:1 relationship before wrapping an axonal segment to form myelin. SC myelination requires the adhesion G protein-coupled receptor GPR126, which undergoes autoproteolytic cleavage into an N-terminal fragment (NTF) and a seven-transmembrane-containing C-terminal fragment (CTF). Here we show that GPR126 has domain-specific functions in SC development whereby the NTF is necessary and sufficient for axon sorting, whereas the CTF promotes wrapping through cAMP elevation. These biphasic roles of GPR126 are governed by interactions with Laminin-211, which we define as a novel ligand for GPR126 that modulates receptor signaling via a tethered agonist. Our work suggests a model in which Laminin-211 mediates GPR126-induced cAMP levels to control early and late stages of SC development."

Allelic differences between the two homologous chromosomes can affect the propensity of inheritance in humans; however, the extent of such differences in the human genome has yet to be fully explored. Here we delineate allelic chromatin modifications and transcriptomes among a broad set of human tissues, enabled by a chromosome-spanning haplotype reconstruction strategy1. The resulting large collection of haplotype-resolved epigenomic maps reveals extensive allelic biases in both chromatin state and transcription, which show considerable variation across tissues and between individuals, and allow us to investigate cis-regulatory relationships between genes and their control sequences. Analyses of histone modification maps also uncover intriguing characteristics of cis-regulatory elements and tissue-restricted activities of repetitive elements. The rich data sets described here will enhance our understanding of the mechanisms by which cis-regulatory elements control gene expression programs."

Hundreds of risk loci for autoimmunity have been identified previously in genome-wide association studies (GWASs), but the implicated loci comprise multiple variants in linkage disequilibrium and rarely alter protein-coding sequence, which complicates their interpretation. This study adopts a new approach for fine mapping causal genetic variants for 21 autoimmune diseases, applying a novel algorithm to GWAS-based loci and integrating genotypic data with epigenomic maps for specialized immune cells. The results implicate a very specific subset of enhancers involved in T-cell stimulation as causal determinants of autoimmune diseases.

There is great interest in understanding the stages and transitions of cell development as pluripotent cells follow the neuronal lineage. Here, Alexander Meissner and colleagues characterize the transcriptional and epigenetic landscape of six consecutive stages as human embryonic stem cells differentiate along the neuronal lineage. The authors apply a powerful computational framework to the data and identify key regulators and their effects on the epigenetic remodelling during these consecutive stages of differentiation.

https://openalex.org/W1975911274,"The psychiatric disorders autism and schizophrenia have a strong genetic component, and copy number variants (CNVs) are firmly implicated. Recurrent deletions and duplications of chromosome 16p11.2 confer a high risk for both diseases, but the pathways disrupted by this CNV are poorly defined. Here we investigate the dynamics of the 16p11.2 network by integrating physical interactions of 16p11.2 proteins with spatiotemporal gene expression from the developing human brain. We observe profound changes in protein interaction networks throughout different stages of brain development and/or in different brain regions. We identify the late mid-fetal period of cortical development as most critical for establishing the connectivity of 16p11.2 proteins with their co-expressed partners. Furthermore, our results suggest that the regulation of the KCTD13-Cul3-RhoA pathway in layer 4 of the inner cortical plate is crucial for controlling brain size and connectivity and that its dysregulation by de novo mutations may be a potential determinant of 16p11.2 CNV deletion and duplication phenotypes."

Upon learning, local inhibitory parvalbumin (PV)-expressing Basket cell networks can switch to opposite configurations that either favor or interfere with further learning, but how this opposite plasticity is induced and relates to distinct learning requirements has remained unclear. Here, we show that PV Basket cells consist of hitherto unrecognized subpopulations, with distinct schedules of neurogenesis, input connectivities, output target neurons, and roles in learning. Plasticity of hippocampal early-born PV neurons was recruited in rule consolidation, whereas plasticity of late-born PV neurons was recruited in new information acquisition. This involved regulation of early-born neuron plasticity specifically through excitation, and of late-born neuron plasticity specifically through inhibition. Therefore, opposite learning requirements are implemented by distinct local networks involving PV Basket cell subpopulations specifically regulated through inhibition or excitation.

This involved regulation of early-born neuron plasticity specifically through excitation, and of late-born neuron plasticity specifically through inhibition. Therefore, opposite learning requirements are implemented by distinct local networks involving PV Basket cell subpopulations specifically regulated through inhibition or excitation. Brain plasticity enables individuals to flexibly produce adaptive behaviors, thereby learning from experience throughout life. Surprisingly, while molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying plasticity of individual synapses have been elucidated in substantial detail, how network and system level plasticity are adjusted to match requirements defined by experience has remained poorly understood. Reinforced trial-and-error learning tasks provide attractive experimental paradigms to investigate how plasticity is adjusted during learning. Thus, effective acquisition and flexible combination of potentially task-relevant information is essential during early phases of trial-and-error learning, whereas reliable application of validated routines dominates toward learning curve completion (Kaelbling et al., 1996Kaelbling L.P. Littman M.L. Moore A.W. Reinforcement learning: a survey.J. Artif. Intell. Res. 1996; 4: 237-285Google Scholar). At the circuit level, these contrasting requirements are reflected by shifts in the configuration of local parvalbumin (PV)-expressing Basket cell networks, which exhibit pronounced plasticity induced by experience (Donato et al., 2013Donato F. Rompani S.B. Caroni P. Parvalbumin-expressing basket-cell network plasticity induced by experience regulates adult learning.Nature. 2013; 504: 272-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). Thus, PV network configurations enriched in neurons expressing low levels of PV and GAD67, and exhibiting high inhibitory connectivity onto them are induced locally early during trial-and-error incremental learning, when they are required for effective learning. Such “low-PV configurations” promote acquisition and retention of new memories and structural synaptic plasticity (Donato et al., 2013Donato F. Rompani S.B. Caroni P. Parvalbumin-expressing basket-cell network plasticity induced by experience regulates adult learning.Nature. 2013; 504: 272-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). By contrast, configurations enriched in neurons expressing high levels of PV and GAD67, and exhibiting high excitatory connectivity onto them are induced toward completion of trial-and-error learning protocols. Such “high-PV configurations” interfere with the acquisition of new memories and structural synaptic plasticity (Donato et al., 2013Donato F. Rompani S.B. Caroni P. Parvalbumin-expressing basket-cell network plasticity induced by experience regulates adult learning.Nature. 2013; 504: 272-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). How induction of opposite PV network configurations is reliably and reversibly coupled to specific requirements during learning has remained unclear. The opposite configurations might emerge through learning-specific mechanisms sequentially shifting whole local PV neuron ensembles toward distinct network states. Alternatively, the opposite configurations might be induced through task-selective regulation of hitherto unknown PV neuron subpopulations. PV-positive Basket cells are widely distributed and abundant GABAergic inhibitory interneurons that provide powerful local feedforward and feedback inhibition through perisomatic boutons onto principal excitatory neurons (Bartos et al., 2007Bartos M.

In addition, PV Basket cells inhibit each other reciprocally through perisomatic innervation and are dynamically coupled electrically through gap junctions (Bartos et al., 2007Bartos M. Vida I.

Amygdala interneuron subtypes control fear learning through disinhibition.Nature. 2014; 509: 453-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). The mechanisms through which PV neuron networks contribute to such a diverse range of functions have remained unclear. The functions of GABAergic interneurons have been traditionally classified based on anatomical connectivities and physiological properties (Klausberger and Somogyi, 2008Klausberger T. Somogyi P.

With the advent of methods for in vivo recording and genetic control of identified neurons in behaving animals, it became apparent that interneuron subtypes have distinct roles during behavior and in learning by flexibly and selectively gating distinct information flows to principal neurons (Cardin et al., 2009Cardin J.A.

Amygdala interneuron subtypes control fear learning through disinhibition.Nature. 2014; 509: 453-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). These observations have led to new classifications of GABAergic neuron subtypes based on their specific circuit functions during behavior, complementing the original classifications based on anatomy and physiology (Kepecs and Fishell, 2014Kepecs A. Fishell G. Interneuron cell types are fit to function.Nature. 2014; 505: 318-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (645) Google Scholar). In keeping with this emerging view of local GABAergic neuron functions, the induction of distinct PV network configurations upon learning might reflect specific and distinct roles of PV neuron subpopulations in different forms of learning. Although PV Basket cells all share characteristic physiological and anatomical features, notable distinctions have been reported (Akgul and Wollmuth, 2013Akgul G. Wollmuth L.P.

A way through which neuronal subpopulations can be specified while maintaining many of their defining functional properties is through the acquisition of subfeatures during distinct developmental time windows of neurogenesis.

Alternatively, closely comparable interneurons generated at different ganglionic eminence locations can have distinct functions (Chittajallu et al., 2013Chittajallu R. Craig M.T. McFarland A. Yuan X.

PV Basket cells are generated in medial ganglionic eminence (MGE) during a protracted period of neurogenesis from embryonic day (E) 9.5 to E15.5 (Fishell, 2007Fishell G. Perspectives on the developmental origins of cortical interneuron diversity.Novartis Found. Symp. 2007; 288 (discussion 35–44, 96–98): 21-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Accordingly, PV neurons generated at different times within this period might differ in connectivity/PV/GAD67 expression and/or in how they are regulated during experience-related plasticity. Here, we investigated how plasticity of PV Basket cell networks leads to opposite configurations in response to specific learning requirements. We provide evidence that PV Basket cells consist of previously unrecognized subpopulations defined by their time schedule of neurogenesis, which exhibit plasticity upon distinct learning requirements and target distinct subpopulations of pyramidal neurons in hippocampal cornus ammonis 1 (CA1). Learning depending on enhanced acquisition and combination of new information induces alterations in inhibitory connectivity specifically onto late-born PV Basket cells, whereas early-born cells are not affected. By contrast, learning that mainly relies on rule application induces alterations in excitatory connectivity onto early-born PV Basket cells, whereas late-born cells are not affected. We further show that early-born PV neuron cell plasticity is specifically regulated by excitation, whereas late-born PV neuron cell plasticity is specifically regulated by PV neuron inhibition. Late-born PV Basket cells specifically account for regulation of plasticity during critical periods of postnatal circuit maturation and upon environmental enrichment. These results reveal how contrasting acquisition/exploitation requirements during learning are implemented through subpopulations of PV-expressing Basket cells, whose plasticity is regulated by distinct forms of learning specifically through excitation or inhibition. Because of their specific regulation properties, the two subpopulations of PV Basket cells might contribute to different mental health dysfunctions in conditions primarily affecting excitatory or inhibitory neurotransmission such as schizophrenia or autism (Chao et al., 2010Chao H.T.

To determine whether there might be PV Basket cell subnetworks that can be regulated independently by experience to reach high- and low-PV configurations, we sequentially subjected mice to learning protocols that induce opposite PV network configurations in the hippocampus. We trained mice in the Morris water maze during 3 days, thereby inducing a low-PV configuration in hippocampal CA3. Mice were subjected to contextual fear conditioning (cFC), a form of learning that induces a high-PV configuration in hippocampal CA3, two hours after the last maze training session (Donato et al., 2013Donato F. Rompani S.B. Caroni P. Parvalbumin-expressing basket-cell network plasticity induced by experience regulates adult learning.Nature. 2013; 504: 272-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). PV signal distributions were analyzed on day 4; i.e., 24 hr after maze training and 22 hr after cFC. Mice, only trained in the maze, exhibited the expected enrichment in low-PV neurons, and mice, only subjected to cFC, exhibited a robust enrichment in high-PV neurons (Figure 1A). By contrast, mice, first trained in the water maze and then fear conditioned, exhibited elevated contents of both low- and high-PV neurons, suggesting that low- and high-PV subnetworks can be induced in parallel upon learning (Figure 1A; one-way ANOVA correlation among all groups, p < 0.01). To further explore regulation of PV neuron subsets upon different forms of learning, we subjected mice to 3 weeks of environmental enrichment (EE), a protocol that induces a low-PV network configuration that persists for more than 8 weeks upon returning mice to control non-enriched conditions (Figure 1B). At the end of the 3 weeks of EE, mice were returned to their home cages and subjected 2 days later to cFC, a protocol that induces a high-PV configuration that persists for less than 2 weeks (Figure 1B). Again, 1 day after, cFC enriched mice exhibited both enhanced low- and high-PV neuron contents in hippocampal CA3 (Figure 1B; one-way ANOVA correlation among all groups, p < 0.01; Student t test: EE versus EE 8 weeks not significant [n.s.], control versus cFC 2 weeks n.s.). Notably, 2 weeks after fear conditioning, the hippocampal PV network in these mice returned to its enriched low-PV configuration, not the baseline configuration (Figure 1B). By providing evidence for long-term memory of a low-PV network configuration in spite of the more transient high-PV arrangement induced upon cFC, these results suggested that independent PV neuron subsets can undergo plasticity upon enrichment and upon cFC. PV neuron subsets could be selected from homogeneous pools of PV neurons through regulation by experience or might reflect the existence of PV neuron subpopulations with distinct regulatory properties. To investigate the possible existence of PV Basket cell subpopulations, we labeled proliferating cells at distinct stages of embryonic development with bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) and analyzed BrdU/PV double-positive cells in hippocampal CA3 of 2–3 months old (adult) mice. We found that hippocampal PV neurons generated at E9.5 or E11.5 were predominantly high- and intermediate-high PV (Figure 2A). By contrast, neurons generated at E13.5 or E15.5 were predominantly intermediate-low- and low-PV (Figure 2A; one-way ANOVA, p < 0.0001). Undistinguishable relationships were detected between time schedules of neurogenesis and PV or GAD-67 levels in PV neurons (Figure 2A). After neurogenesis, PV Basket cells migrate from MGE to populate most brain regions (Fishell, 2007Fishell G. Perspectives on the developmental origins of cortical interneuron diversity.Novartis Found. Symp. 2007; 288 (discussion 35–44, 96–98): 21-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar, Marín, 2012Marín O. Interneuron dysfunction in psychiatric disorders.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2012; 13: 107-120PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether the dramatic bias in adult PV levels as a function of birthdate might apply generally to MGE-derived PV neurons, we analyzed BrdU/PV double-positive cells in hippocampal CA1, primary somatosensory whisker cortex, and dorsal striatum. In these different brain regions PV levels were again consistently correlated to birthdate, with intermediate-high/high-PV levels in E9.5- and E11.5-born cells and intermediate-low/low-PV levels in E13.5- and E15.5-born cells (Figure 2B). Basket cells with high, respectively low PV/GAD67 levels exhibit major differences in excitatory and inhibitory synaptic puncta densities in the adult (Donato et al., 2013Donato F. Rompani S.B. Caroni P. Parvalbumin-expressing basket-cell network plasticity induced by experience regulates adult learning.Nature. 2013; 504: 272-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). Specifically, excitatory (Bassoon/PSD95-positive) to inhibitory (Gephyrin/VGAT-positive) synaptic puncta ratios vary as a function of PV signal levels, and are up to 4:1 in the most high-PV neurons and 1:2 in the most low-PV neurons (Figure 2C). This striking relationship between excitatory/inhibitory synaptic puncta ratios and PV levels was matched by a corresponding relationship between PV cell birthdate and synapse densities (Figure 2C; Student’s t test, E9.5 and E11.5 differ from E13.5 and E15.5, p < 0.001 [Bassoon] and p < 0.01 [Gephyrin]; no significant difference between E9.5 and E11.5 or between E13.5 and E15.5). Notably, at comparable PV levels, early-born PV neurons tended to exhibit higher excitatory synaptic puncta densities, whereas late-born neurons exhibited higher inhibitory synaptic puncta densities, suggesting that early- and late-born PV neurons might differ in how they receive excitatory, respectively inhibitory synapses (Figure 2D). Therefore, PV neurons generated during the first half of subpallium neurogenesis (early-born) mainly exhibit high PV and GAD-67 level distributions and high excitatory synaptic puncta densities in the adult, whereas PV neurons generated during the second half of subpallium neurogenesis (late-born) predominantly exhibit low PV and GAD-67 levels and higher inhibitory synaptic puncta densities in the adult (Figure 2E). To determine whether the relationship between developmental time of neurogenesis and PV-excitatory/inhibitory values under baseline adult conditions reflects intrinsic properties of PV neurons and/or distinct signals from the environment during their migration and local network incorporation, we carried out donor-host graft experiments in embryonic mice. In a first series of experiments, donor PV neurons were dissected from the MGE of E13.5 PV-Cre:Rosa-flex-tdTomato embryos in which PV-expressing neurons are fated to express tdTomato, dissociated in vitro, concentrated, and injected under ultrasound guidance into E11.5 non-transgenic host MGE (Figure 3A). We determined whether, in the adult, the relatively older donor PV neurons had assumed an early, host-related fate, or whether they had maintained a late donor-related fate. We found that tdTomato-positive donor PV neurons exhibited predominantly low-PV neuron values characteristic of their birthdate in the donor embryo (Figures 3A and 3B; Mann-Whitney test, E11.5 versus E.13.5 or versus donor, p < 0.0001 and E13.5 versus donor, n.s.). In parallel, late-born donor neurons exhibited low excitatory/inhibitory synaptic puncta ratio distributions (absolute values and variances) characteristic of late-born low-PV neurons (Figure 3C). In complementary experiments, we delivered neurons from the MGE of E11.5 PV-Cre:Rosa-flex-tdTomato embryos into E13.5 non-transgenic host MGE. We found that tdTomato-positive donor PV neurons exhibited high- and intermediate-high PV neuron values characteristic of their birthdate in the donor E11.5 embryo (Figure 3D). Therefore, PV and excitation/inhibition connectivity profiles of early- and late-born PV neurons in the adult reflect distinct intrinsic properties of these neurons determined at the time of neurogenesis. These results are consistent with the possibility that PV Basket cells generated during early and late developmental windows of neurogenesis might represent distinct subpopulations of PV neurons. To determine whether intrinsic properties of PV neurons generated at early and late embryonic developmental time points might influence how these neurons are affected by learning in the adult, we subjected BrdU-labeled 2–3- months-old mice to either cFC or EE. cFC had a major impact on PV value distributions in hippocampal CA3 cells labeled at E9.5 or E11.5 (Figure 4A). By contrast, PV value distributions in cells labeled at E13.5 or E15.5 were not noticeably affected by cFC (Figure 4A). Conversely, EE affected PV value distributions of hippocampal CA3 cells labeled at E13.5 or E15.5, but cells labeled at E9.5 or E11.5 exhibited no noticeable changes in PV value distributions upon EE (Figure 4A). Estimated fractions of PV neurons generated at the various time windows against the total of BrdU labeled PV neurons were 18.5% (E9.5), 32% (E11.5), 35.5% (E13.5), and 14% (E15.5). Combining these estimates with the values in Figures 1A, 2A, and 4A, we predict 48.7% high-PV neurons upon cFC (versus about 49.8% in Figure 1A) and 34.7% low-PV neurons upon EE (versus 35% in Figure 1A). In parallel, excitatory/inhibitory synaptic puncta ratios were affected by cFC selectively in cells labeled at E9.5 and E11.5 (excitatory puncta densities further enhanced), and by EE selectively in cells labeled at E13.5 or E15.5 (inhibitory puncta densities further enhanced; Figure 4B). To search for molecular counterparts of excitatory versus inhibitory experience-dependent connectivity regulation onto early- versus late-born PV neurons, we focused on Mef2a, an activity-regulated transcription factor that has been linked to learning-related plasticity and that negatively regulates excitatory synapse numbers (Flavell et al., 2006Flavell S.W. Cowan C.W. Kim T.K. Greer P.L. Lin Y. Paradis S. Griffith E.C. Hu L.S. Chen C. Greenberg M.E. Activity-dependent regulation of MEF2 transcription factors suppresses excitatory synapse number.Science. 2006; 311: 1008-1012Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). Under baseline conditions, PV and Mef2a levels in PV neurons were positively correlated, with highest Mef2a signals in early-born high-PV neurons and lowest Mef2a signals in late-born low-PV neurons (Figure 4C). Upon cFC, Mef2a levels decreased specifically in early-born PV neurons in parallel with increased excitatory puncta densities (Figure 4C). Furthermore, upon EE, Mef2a levels increased specifically in late-born PV neurons in parallel with increased inhibitory puncta densities (Figure 4C). Notably, regardless of endpoint PV values, Mef2a values of early-born neurons (>95%, p < 0.01) were regulated by cFC, but not EE, whereas Mef2a values of late-born neurons were regulated by EE, but not cFC (Figure 4D). In control experiments, baseline and learning-induced changes in PV network configurations of BrdU-labeled mice were undistinguishable from those in non-labeled mice (data not shown). To investigate whether subpopulation specific regulation of PV neurons during learning is a general phenomenon not restricted to cFC and EE, we analyzed PV and Mef2a level regulation in BrdU-labeled cells of mice subjected to water maze training. In this trial and error incremental learning protocol, hippocampal CA3 PV neurons first shift to a low-PV network configuration (days 2–6) and then to a high-PV network configuration (>day 7) (Donato et al., 2013Donato F. Rompani S.B. Caroni P. Parvalbumin-expressing"
https://openalex.org/W2159089370,"The origin of lithium is key to understanding the enrichment history of the Universe; now the classical nova V339 Del (Nova Delphini 2013) reveals that nova explosions could have been contributing to the recent rapid increase of the amount of lithium in the Universe. Although lithium is believed to have made an early appearance in the Universe — some may have been produced by the Big Bang — other more recent sources are also suspected including novae and supernova explosions. This paper reports the detection of highly blue-shifted resonance lines of beryllium-7, the singly ionized radioactive isotope of beryllium that decays with a half-life of 53 days to form lithium-7, observed in the post-outburst ultraviolet spectra of the classical nova V339 Del (Nova Delphini 2013). This result supports the theoretical prediction that a significant amount of 7Li is produced in classical nova explosions. The origin of lithium (Li) and its production process have long been uncertain. Li could be produced by Big Bang nucleosynthesis, interactions of energetic cosmic rays with interstellar matter, evolved low-mass stars, novae, and supernova explosions. Chemical evolution models and observed stellar Li abundances suggest that at least half the Li may have been produced in red giants, asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars, and novae1,2,3. No direct evidence, however, for the supply of Li from evolved stellar objects to the Galactic medium has hitherto been found. Here we report the detection of highly blue-shifted resonance lines of the singly ionized radioactive isotope of beryllium, 7Be, in the near-ultraviolet spectra of the classical nova V339 Del (Nova Delphini 2013) 38 to 48 days after the explosion. 7Be decays to form 7Li within a short time (half-life of 53.22 days4). The 7Be was created during the nova explosion via the alpha-capture reaction 3He(α,γ)7Be (ref. 5). This result supports the theoretical prediction that a significant amount of 7Li is produced in classical nova explosions."
https://openalex.org/W2052299360,"The progressive degeneration of the dopamine neurons of the pars compacta of substantia nigra and the consequent loss of the dopamine innervation of the striatum leads to the impairment of motor behavior in Parkinson's disease. Accordingly, an efficient therapy of the disease should protect and regenerate the dopamine neurons of the substantia nigra and the dopamine innervation of the striatum. Nigral neurons express Brain Derived Neurotropic Factor (BDNF) and dopamine D3 receptors, both of which protect the dopamine neurons. The chronic activation of dopamine D3 receptors by their agonists, in addition, restores, in part, the dopamine innervation of the striatum. Here we explored whether the over-expression of BDNF by dopamine neurons potentiates the effect of the activation of D3 receptors restoring nigrostriatal innervation. Twelve-month old Wistar rats were unilaterally injected with 6-hydroxydopamine into the striatum. Five months later, rats were treated with the D3 agonist 7-hydroxy-N,N-di-n-propy1-2-aminotetralin (7-OH-DPAT) administered i.p. during 4½ months via osmotic pumps and the BDNF gene transfection into nigral cells using the neurotensin-polyplex nanovector (a non-viral transfection) that selectively transfect the dopamine neurons via the high-affinity neurotensin receptor expressed by these neurons. Two months after the withdrawal of 7-OH-DPAT when rats were aged (24 months old), immunohistochemistry assays were made. The over-expression of BDNF in rats receiving the D3 agonist normalized gait and motor coordination; in addition, it eliminated the muscle rigidity produced by the loss of dopamine. The recovery of motor behavior was associated with the recovery of the nigral neurons, the dopamine innervation of the striatum and of the number of dendritic spines of the striatal neurons. Thus, the over-expression of BDNF in dopamine neurons associated with the chronic activation of the D3 receptors appears to be a promising strategy for restoring dopamine neurons in Parkinson's disease."

Protein phosphatase 2A regulatory subunits and cancer.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2009; 1795: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar) (see Table 1). Binding of these B subunits directs PP2A substrate specificity. Ppp2r2d belongs to the PPP2R2 family, which contains four isoforms (18Eichhorn P.J. Creyghton M.P. Bernards R.

Diabetes is a major risk factor for the occurrence of cardiovascular disease and atherosclerosis. As the aorta is a major site for lipid deposition and plaque formation, we wanted to determine how AMP kinase activity was regulated in this organ. We reasoned that treating AMP kinase at the specific plaque-forming site represents a novel approach to reducing the severity of cardiovascular disease in diabetic patients. To date, the particular PP2A B subunit(s) dephosphorylating Thr-172 in aorta in response to diet remains to be elucidated. Here we show that PPP2APpp2r2d directly regulates lipid metabolism through its dephosphorylation of Thr-172, thus negatively regulating AMP kinase activity in the aorta. The results suggest that early activation of PPP2APpp2r2d in response to a western style diet may help to initiate aortic plaque formation and atherosclerosis. A7r5 (rat aortic smooth muscle) and human vascular smooth muscle (HVSM) cells were obtained from ATCC. A7r5 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (ATCC® 30-2002TM) modified to contain 4 mm glutamine, 4500 mg/liter glucose, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, and 1500 mg/liter sodium bicarbonate supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. HVSM cells were cultured in F-12K medium supplemented with 0.05 mg/ml ascorbic acid, 0.01 mg/ml insulin-transferrin-sodium selenite, 0.03 mg/ml endothelial cell growth supplement, 10% FBS, 10% HEPES, and 10 mm TES. Cells were incubated at 37 °C with 5% CO2. All cells were serum-starved overnight before initiating any experiments. For methyl-β-cyclodextrin (MCD; Sigma) and MCD-cholesterol (Sigma) treatments, cells were incubated in serum-free medium containing 50 μm MCD and 1 μg/ml MCD-cholesterol, respectively, at 37 °C for 2 h. Okadaic acid (OA) was purchased from Calbiochem (80055-324). STO-609 was purchased from Sigma. Soon after the mice were euthanized, aortas were dissected and cleaned of adhering fat and soft tissues. Aortas were washed in ice-cold PBS to remove blood tissues, snap frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C until further processing. Mouse aortic lysates were prepared by homogenization in radioimmuneprecipitation assay buffer containing phosphatase and protease inhibitors. Tissue and cell debris were removed by centrifugation, and protein concentration was determined using a Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). A7r5 cells were serum-starved overnight. The next day cells were treated with 500 pm, 1 nm, 5 nm, and 10 nm OA. Control cells were treated with DMSO. Protein concentration was determined using the Bradford assay system. Lysates were stored at −80 °C. Phosphatase activity was determined using the DuoIC set PP2A phosphatase activity kit (R&D Systems) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were rinsed two times with TBS. Cells were solubilized in 1 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES, 0.1 mm EGTA, 0.1 mm EDTA, 120 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, pH 7.5, 25 μg/ml leupeptin, 25 μg/ml pepstatin, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm PMSF)/1 × 107 cells. Cell extract was centrifuged at 2000 × g for 5 min, and sample protein concentration was quantified using a Bradford assay. 300–400 μg of the cell lysate was added to 96-well plates coated with immobilized capture antibody specific for the catalytic subunit of PP2A. After removing unbound material, a serine/threonine synthetic phosphopeptide substrate, which is dephosphorylated by active PP2A to generate free phosphate and unphosphorylated peptide, was added. The free phosphate released during the 30-min incubation was then detected by a dye binding assay using malachite green and molybdic acid. The activity of PP2A was determined by calculating the rate of phosphate release. For Western analysis, cell cultures were collected by centrifugation at 2000 rpm for 5 min. Cells were washed with ice-cold PBS and centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 10 min. The cell pellet was resuspended in 150–200 μl of radioimmuneprecipitation assay buffer containing phosphatase and protease inhibitors. The cell suspension was subjected to bioruption two times for 5 min each and pelleted at high speed. Protein concentration was determined using the Bradford assay. Aliquots of cell lysate (50 μg) were stored at −80 °C or used in co-immunoprecipitation assays. Total protein from lysates or co-immunoprecipitates that were to be analyzed was resuspended in protein sample buffer and incubated at 95 °C for 10 min. All samples were subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE. Resolved proteins were transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane. The immunoblot membranes were then blocked for 1 h with 10% milk and washed once with TBS-Tween 20. The membranes were incubated with primary antibody overnight at the appropriate dilutions. After five washes with TBS-Tween 20 for 10 min each, membranes were incubated with appropriate secondary antibody for 1 h. After five washes with TBS-Tween 20 for 10 min each, the membranes were immersed in a chemiluminescent agent and exposed for 2–5 min. Antibody dilutions were as follows: PPP2CA, 1:2000 (Abcam, ab33537); PPP2CB, 1:2000 (Abcam, ab72343); PPP2R1A, 1:1000 (Abcam, ab24728–100); PPP2R2D, 1:500 (GeneTex, GTX116609); PPP2R5E, 1:500 (GeneTex); pLKB1, 1:250 (Cell Signaling Technology); Camkkβ, 1:500 (Cell Signaling Technology); CamkII, 1:500 (Cell Signaling Technology); phosphorylated AMP kinase α (pAMPKα), 1:250 (Cell Signaling Technology); β-actin, 1:1000 (Abcam). A7r5 or HVSM cells were seeded in 10-cm plates and grown to 80% confluence. Cells were serum-starved the day before siRNA treatment. 100 μm siRNA stock solution was prepared in 1× reaction buffer. siRNAs that were used targeted the following genes: rat PPP2CA, PPP2CB, PPP2R1A, PPP2R1B, LKB1, and CAMKKβ; human PPP2CA, PPP2CB, PPP2R1A, PPP2R2D, LKB1, and CAMKKβ. Non-targeting siRNA was used in all cell lines as a control. For the experiment, the siRNA was diluted in serum-free medium (Opti-MEM, Invitrogen) in tube 1. In tube 2, DharmaFECT transfection reagent was diluted with Opti-MEM. Each tube was incubated for 5 min at room temperature. The content of tube 1 was added to tube 2, mixed, and incubated for 20 min at room temperature. The mixture was then added to the serum-starved cells to obtain a final concentration of 100 nm siRNA. After 24 and 48 h of siRNA treatment, cells were harvested for protein extraction. Proteins were stored at −80 °C after assaying the protein level using the Bradford assay system or were resolved by SDS-PAGE immediately for Western analysis. The interactions between various proteins were assayed by using co-immunoprecipitation using the ProFound mammalian co-immunoprecipitation kit (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, antibodies specific for Ppp2ca, Ppp2r1a, Ppp2r2d, Ppp2r5e, or Ampkα were treated with AminoLink® plus coupling gel slurry containing the beads overnight at 4 °C by end-over-end mixing. Subsequently, antibodies immobilized on beads were incubated with 300 μg of cell lysate at room temperature for 90 min. Beads were then extensively washed to remove all unbound proteins. Proteins bound to antibodies were separated using an elution buffer supplied by the commercial kit. The eluted proteins were further analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. Beads that were not immobilized with target antibodies served as the control to account for any nonspecific interaction between the proteins and the beads. Rat A7r5 cells (50,000) were seeded on poly-l-lysine treated coverslips in 24-well plates and cultured overnight in DMEM with 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C in an incubator with an atmosphere of 5% CO2. The cells then were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 15 min at room temperature and washed three times followed by a permeabilization step with 0.25% Triton X-100, PBS for 8 min at room temperature. The cells were blocked in 10% donkey serum in 0.05% Triton X-100 in PBS at room temperature for 1 h and then treated with a 1:50 dilution of primary antibodies (PPP2R2D (Abcam)) and AMPKα1 antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) in 2% donkey serum, 0.05% Triton X-100, PBS for 2 h at 30 °C. After extensive washing with 0.05% Triton X-100 in PBS, the coverslips were incubated with a 1:100 dilution of secondary antibodies (Cy3-conjugated rabbit antibodies and DyLight 488-conjugated goat antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) in 2% donkey serum, 0.05% Triton X-100 in PBS at room temperature for 1 h. After extensive washing with 0.05% Triton X-100 in PBS and a final rinse with water, the coverslips were mounted in Fluoromount-G, imaged by a Leica DMI6000B microscope, and analyzed by ImageJ software. Cholesterol content in cell lysates were determined using the cholesterol assay kit supplied by Cell Biolabs Inc. according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells treated with MCD or MCD-cholesterol were washed three times with cold PBS prior to lysis. Cells were extracted with 200 μl of chloroform:isopropanol:Nonidet P-40 (7:11:0.1) in a microhomogenizer. The extracts were centrifuged for 10 min at 15,000 × g. Without disturbing the pellet, the aqueous layer was transferred to a new tube and air-dried. The dried lipids were dissolved in 200 μl of 1× assay diluent supplied with the kit. 50 μl of cholesterol reaction reagent was added to each well of the 96-well plate containing the samples and cholesterol standards, and the plates were incubated for 45 min at 37 °C. Plates were read immediately after incubation with a fluorescence microplate reader equipped for excitation in the 530–570-nm range and for emission in the 590–600-nm range. Cholesterol standards and samples were assayed in triplicate, and a freshly prepared standard curve was used each time the assay was performed. Wild type male C57BL/6J (B6) mice were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory and housed at Temple University, Philadelphia, PA. The Temple University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee approved all experimental procedures. 6–8-week-old male C57BL/6J mice were fed either a normal diet (7% fat; BioServ) or a high fat diet (21% fat; BioServ) for 12 weeks. Fasted blood samples were taken every 4 weeks. Blood serum was used to measure total cholesterol, triglycerides, LDL, and HDL using the cholesterol and triglyceride assay kits (Stanbio, Boerne, TX) following the manufacturer's protocol. Mice from each group were sacrificed at weeks 4, 8, and 12, and aortas were collected for Western blot analysis. Total RNA was extracted with TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). cDNA was synthesized from total RNA using the RT Easy First Strand kit (Qiagen). Quantitative RT-PCR was carried out using a Stratagene MX3005P system. The relative mRNA levels were normalized to levels of GAPDH. The data shown are the average of five independent experiments. The data are the mean ± S.E. Statistical analysis was performed using Student's t test. The PP2A inhibitor OA was used to see wh"

https://openalex.org/W2059339530,"National Parks are hallmarks of ecosystem preservation in the United States. The introduction of alien invasive plant species threatens protection of these areas. Bromus tectorum L. (commonly called downy brome or cheatgrass), which is found in Rocky Mountain National Park (hereafter, the Park), Colorado, USA, has been implicated in early spring competition with native grasses, decreased soil nitrogen, altered nutrient and hydrologic regimes, and increased fire intensity. We estimated the potential distribution of B. tectorum in the Park based on occurrence records (n = 211), current and future climate, and distance to roads and trails. An ensemble of six future climate scenarios indicated the habitable area of B. tectorum may increase from approximately 5.5% currently to 20.4% of the Park by the year 2050. Using ordination methods we evaluated the climatic space occupied by B. tectorum in the Park and how this space may shift given future climate change. Modeling climate change at a small extent (1,076 km2) and at a fine spatial resolution (90 m) is a novel approach in species distribution modeling, and may provide inference for microclimates not captured in coarse-scale models. Maps from our models serve as high-resolution hypotheses that can be improved over time by land managers to set priorities for surveys and removal of invasive species such as B. tectorum."

The role these fungi play in skin diseases and why they are pathogenic for only some individuals remain unclear. This study aimed to characterize Malassezia microbiota from different body sites in healthy and SD subjects from Brazil. Scalp and forehead samples from healthy, mild SD and severe SD subjects were collected. Non-scalp lesions from severe SD patients were also sampled. 5.8S rDNA/ITS2 amplicons from Malassezia sp. were analyzed by RFLP and sequencing. Results indicate that Malassezia microbiota did not group according to health condition or body area. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that three groups of sequences did not cluster together with any formally described species, suggesting that they might belong to potential new species. One of them was found in high proportions in scalp samples. A large variety of Malassezia subtypes were detected, indicating intra-specific diversity. Higher M. globosa proportions were found in non-scalp lesions from severe SD subjects compared with other areas, suggesting closer association of this species with SD lesions from areas other than scalp. Our results show the first panorama of Malassezia microbiota in Brazilian subjects using molecular techniques and provide new perspectives for further studies to elucidate the association between Malassezia microbiota and skin diseases."

G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) comprise a large clan of cell surface proteins that have been implicated as therapeutic targets in PCa growth and progression. The findings reported here provide intriguing evidence of a role for the newly characterized glutamate family member GPR158 in PCa growth and progression. We found that GPR158 promotes PCa cell proliferation independent of androgen receptor (AR) functionality and that this requires its localization in the nucleus of the cell. This suggests that GPR158 acts by mechanisms different from other GPCRs. GPR158 expression is stimulated by androgens and GPR158 stimulates AR expression, implying a potential to sensitize tumors to low androgen conditions during ADT via a positive feedback loop. Further, we found GPR158 expression correlates with a neuroendocrine (NE) differentiation phenotype and promotes anchorage-independent colony formation implying a role for GPR158 in therapeutic progression and tumor formation. GPR158 expression was increased at the invading front of prostate tumors that formed in the genetically defined conditional Pten knockout mouse model, and co-localized with elevated AR expression in the cell nucleus. Kaplan-Meier analysis on a dataset from the Memorial Sloan Kettering cancer genome portal showed that increased GPR158 expression in tumors is associated with lower disease-free survival. Our findings strongly suggest that pharmaceuticals targeting GPR158 activities could represent a novel and innovative approach to the prevention and management of CRPC."
https://openalex.org/W2045233218,"Mitochondrial DNA/protein complexes (nucleoids) appear as discrete entities inside the mitochondrial network when observed by live-cell imaging and immunofluorescence. This somewhat trivial observation in recent years has spurred research towards isolation of these complexes and the identification of nucleoid-associated proteins. Here we show that whole cell formaldehyde crosslinking combined with affinity purification and tandem mass-spectrometry provides a simple and reproducible method to identify potential nucleoid associated proteins. The method avoids spurious mitochondrial isolation and subsequent multifarious nucleoid enrichment protocols and can be implemented to allow for label-free quantification (LFQ) by mass-spectrometry. Using expression of a Flag-tagged Twinkle helicase and appropriate controls we show that this method identifies many previously identified nucleoid associated proteins. Using LFQ to compare HEK293 cells with and without mtDNA, but both expressing Twinkle-FLAG, identifies many proteins that are reduced or absent in the absence of mtDNA. This set not only includes established mtDNA maintenance proteins but also many proteins involved in mitochondrial RNA metabolism and translation and therefore represents what can be considered an mtDNA gene expression proteome. Our data provides a very valuable resource for both basic mitochondrial researchers as well as clinical geneticists working to identify novel disease genes on the basis of exome sequence data."
https://openalex.org/W2090119891,"Mutations in genes encoding cartilage oligomeric matrix protein and matrilin-3 cause a spectrum of chondrodysplasias called multiple epiphyseal dysplasia (MED) and pseudoachondroplasia (PSACH). The majority of these diseases feature classical endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and activation of the unfolded protein response (UPR) as a result of misfolding of the mutant protein. However, the importance and the pathological contribution of ER stress in the disease pathogenesis are unknown. The aim of this study was to investigate the generic role of ER stress and the UPR in the pathogenesis of these diseases. A transgenic mouse line (ColIITgcog) was generated using the collagen II promoter to drive expression of an ER stress-inducing protein (Tgcog) in chondrocytes. The skeletal and histological phenotypes of these ColIITgcog mice were characterised. The expression and intracellular retention of Tgcog induced ER stress and activated the UPR as characterised by increased BiP expression, phosphorylation of eIF2α and spliced Xbp1. ColIITgcog mice exhibited decreased long bone growth and decreased chondrocyte proliferation rate. However, there was no disruption of chondrocyte morphology or growth plate architecture and perturbations in apoptosis were not apparent. Our data demonstrate that the targeted induction of ER stress in chondrocytes was sufficient to reduce the rate of bone growth, a key clinical feature associated with MED and PSACH, in the absence of any growth plate dysplasia. This study establishes that classical ER stress is a pathogenic factor that contributes to the disease mechanism of MED and PSACH. However, not all the pathological features of MED and PSACH were recapitulated, suggesting that a combination of intra- and extra-cellular factors are likely to be responsible for the disease pathology as a whole."
https://openalex.org/W2079248268,"Background: Mesp1 and Etv2 are essential transcription factors in the regulation of mesodermal lineage development, but their relationship is unclear. Results: Mesp1 interacts physically with Creb1 and transcriptionally regulates Etv2 gene expression. Conclusion: Etv2 is a direct downstream target gene of Mesp1. Significance: This is the first report to identify Creb1 as a coactivator of Mesp1 to regulate gene expression. Mesoderm posterior 1 (Mesp1) is well recognized for its role in cardiac development, although it is expressed broadly in mesodermal lineages. We have previously demonstrated important roles for Mesp1 and Ets variant 2 (Etv2) during lineage specification, but their relationship has not been defined. This study reveals that Mesp1 binds to the proximal promoter and transactivates Etv2 gene expression via the CRE motif. We also demonstrate the protein-protein interaction between Mesp1 and cAMP-responsive element binding protein 1 (Creb1) in vitro and in vivo. Utilizing transgenesis, lineage tracing, flow cytometry, and immunostaining technologies, we define the lineage relationship between Mesp1- and Etv2-expressing cell populations. We observe that the majority of Etv2-EYFP+ cells are derived from Mesp1-Cre+ cells in both the embryo and yolk sac. Furthermore, we observe that the conditional deletion of Etv2, using a Mesp1-Cre transgenic strategy, results in vascular and hematopoietic defects similar to those observed in the global deletion of Etv2 and that it has embryonic lethality by embryonic day 9.5. In summary, our study supports the hypothesis that Mesp1 is a direct upstream transactivator of Etv2 during embryogenesis and that Creb1 is an important cofactor of Mesp1 in the transcriptional regulation of Etv2 gene expression."
https://openalex.org/W2019388487,"The interruptive effect of painful experimental stimulation on cognitive processes is a well-known phenomenon. This study investigated the influence of pain duration on the negative effects of pain on cognition. Thirty-four healthy volunteers performed a rapid serial visual presentation task (RSVP) in which subjects had to detect (visual detection task) and count the occurrence of a target letter (working memory task) in two separate sessions while being stimulated on the left volar forearm with either short (2 sec) or long (18 sec) painful heat stimuli of equal subjective intensity. The results show that subjects performed significantly worse in the long pain session as indexed by decreased detection and counting performance. Interestingly, this effect on performance was also observed during control trials of the long pain session in which participants did not receive any painful stimulation. Moreover, subjects expected long painful stimulation to have a greater impact on their performance and individual expectation correlated with working memory performance. These findings suggest that not only the length of painful stimulation but also its expected ability to impair cognitive functioning might influence the interruptive function of pain. The exact relevance of expectation for the detrimental effects of pain on cognitive processes needs to be explored in more detail in future studies."
https://openalex.org/W2035211397,"In the legal system, inconsistencies in eyewitness accounts are often used to discredit witnesses’ credibility. This is at odds with research findings showing that witnesses frequently report reminiscent details (details previously unrecalled) at an accuracy rate that is nearly as high as for consistently recalled information. The present study sought to put the validity of beliefs about recall consistency to a test by directly comparing them with actual memory performance in two recall attempts. All participants watched a film of a staged theft. Subsequently, the memory group (N = 84) provided one statement immediately after the film (either with the Self-Administered Interview or free recall) and one after a one-week delay. The estimation group (N = 81) consisting of experienced police detectives estimated the recall performance of the memory group. The results showed that actual recall performance was consistently underestimated. Also, a sharp decline of memory performance between recall attempts was assumed by the estimation group whereas actual accuracy remained stable. While reminiscent details were almost as accurate as consistent details, they were estimated to be much less accurate than consistent information and as inaccurate as direct contradictions. The police detectives expressed a great concern that reminiscence was the result of suggestive external influences. In conclusion, it seems that experienced police detectives hold many implicit beliefs about recall consistency that do not correspond with actual recall performance. Recommendations for police trainings are provided. These aim at fostering a differentiated view on eyewitness performance and the inclusion of more comprehensive classes on human memory structure."
https://openalex.org/W1964160926,"Vaccines based on hepatitis B virus (HBV) genotype A have been used worldwide for immunoprophylaxis and are thought to prevent infections by non-A HBV strains effectively, whereas, vaccines generated from genotype C have been used in several Asian countries, including Japan and Korea, where HBV genotype C is prevalent. However, acute hepatitis B caused by HBV genotype A infection has been increasing in Japan and little is known about the efficacy of immunization with genotype C-based vaccines against non-C infection. We have isolated human monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) from individuals who were immunized with the genotype C-based vaccine. In this study, the efficacies of these two mAbs, HB0116 and HB0478, were analyzed using in vivo and in vitro models of HBV infection. Intravenous inoculation of HBV genotype C into chimeric mice with human hepatocytes resulted in the establishment of HBV infection after five weeks, whereas preincubation of the inocula with HB0116 or HB0478 protected chimeric mice from genotype C infection completely. Interestingly, both HB0116 and HB0478 were found to block completely genotype A infection. Moreover, infection by a genotype C strain with an immune escape substitution of amino acid 145 in the hepatitis B surface protein was also completely inhibited by incubation with HB0478. Finally, in vitro analysis of dose dependency revealed that the amounts of HB0478 required for complete protection against genotype C and genotype A infection were 5.5 mIU and 55 mIU, respectively. These results suggested that genotype C-based vaccines have ability to induce cross-genotype immunity against HBV infection."
https://openalex.org/W1995623997,"The inflammatory cytokine interferon-gamma (IFNγ) is crucial for immunity against intracellular pathogens such as the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, the causative agent of Chagas disease (CD). IFNγ is a pleiotropic cytokine which regulates activation of immune and non-immune cells; however, the effect of IFNγ in the central nervous system (CNS) and astrocytes during CD is unknown. Here we show that parasite persists in the CNS of C3H/He mice chronically infected with the Colombian T. cruzi strain despite the increased expression of IFNγ mRNA. Furthermore, most of the T. cruzi-bearing cells were astrocytes located near IFNγ+ cells. Surprisingly, in vitro experiments revealed that pretreatment with IFNγ promoted the infection of astrocytes by T. cruzi increasing uptake and proliferation of intracellular forms, despite inducing increased production of nitric oxide (NO). Importantly, the effect of IFNγ on T. cruzi uptake and growth is completely blocked by the anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) antibody Infliximab and partially blocked by the inhibitor of nitric oxide synthesis L-NAME. These data support that IFNγ fuels astrocyte infection by T. cruzi and critically implicate IFNγ-stimulated T. cruzi-infected astrocytes as sources of TNF and NO, which may contribute to parasite persistence and CNS pathology in CD."
https://openalex.org/W2089683746,"Various types of antipsychotics have been developed for the treatment of schizophrenia since the accidental discovery of the antipsychotic activity of chlorpromazine. Although all clinically effective antipsychotic agents have common properties to interact with the dopamine D2 receptor (D2R) activation, their precise mechanisms of action remain elusive. Antipsychotics are well known to induce transcriptional changes of immediate early genes (IEGs), raising the possibility that gene expressions play an essential role to improve psychiatric symptoms. Here, we report that while different classes of antipsychotics have complex pharmacological profiles against D2R, they share common transcriptome fingerprint (TFP) profile of IEGs in the murine brain in vivo by quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR). Our data showed that various types of antipsychotics with a profound interaction of D2R including haloperidol (antagonist), olanzapine (antagonist), and aripiprazole (partial agonist) all share common spatial TFPs closely homologous to those of D2R antagonist sulpiride, and elicited greater transcriptional responses in the striatum than in the nucleus accumbens. Meanwhile, D2R agonist quinpirole and propsychotic NMDA antagonists such as MK-801 and phencyclidine (PCP) exhibited the contrasting TFP profiles. Clozapine and propsychotic drug methamphetamine (MAP) displayed peculiar TFPs that reflect their unique pharmacological property. Our results suggest that transcriptional responses are conserved across various types of antipsychotics clinically effective in positive symptoms of schizophrenia and also show that temporal and spatial TFPs may reflect the pharmacological features of the drugs. Thus, we propose that a TFP approach is beneficial to evaluate novel drug candidates for antipsychotic development."

https://openalex.org/W2017781661,"Recently, we have reported that the active form of Rac 1 GTPase binds to the glycogen phosphorylase muscle isoform (PYGM) and modulates its enzymatic activity leading to T cell proliferation. In the lymphoid system, Rac 1 and in general other small GTPases of the Rho family participate in the signaling cascades that are activated after engagement of the T cell antigen receptor. However, little is known about the IL-2-dependent Rac 1 activator molecules. For the first time, a signaling pathway leading to the activation of Rac 1/PYGM in response to IL-2-stimulated T cell proliferation is described. More specifically, αPIX, a known guanine nucleotide exchange factor for the small GTPases of the Rho family, preferentially Rac 1, mediates PYGM activation in Kit 225 T cells stimulated with IL-2. Using directed mutagenesis, phosphorylation of αPIX Rho-GEF serines 225 and 488 is required for activation of the Rac 1/PYGM pathway. IL-2-stimulated serine phosphorylation was corroborated in Kit 225 T cells cultures. A parallel pharmacological and genetic approach identified PKCθ as the serine/threonine kinase responsible for αPIX serine phosphorylation. The phosphorylated state of αPIX was required to activate first Rac 1 and subsequently PYGM. These results demonstrate that the IL-2 receptor activation, among other early events, leads to activation of PKCθ. To activate Rac 1 and consequently PYGM, PKCθ phosphorylates αPIX in T cells. The biological significance of this PKCθ/αPIX/Rac 1 GTPase/PYGM signaling pathway seems to be the control of different cellular responses such as migration and proliferation.

https://openalex.org/W2014173674,"We present here a new model of the cellular dynamics that enable regeneration of complex biological morphologies. Biological cell structures are considered as an ensemble of mathematical points on the plane. Each cell produces a signal which propagates in space and is received by other cells. The total signal received by each cell forms a signal distribution defined on the cell structure. This distribution characterizes the geometry of the cell structure. If a part of this structure is removed, the remaining cells have two signals. They keep the value of the signal which they had before the amputation (memory), and they receive a new signal produced after the amputation. Regeneration of the cell structure is stimulated by the difference between the old and the new signals. It is stopped when the two signals coincide. The algorithm of regeneration contains certain rules which are essential for its functioning, being the first quantitative model of cellular memory that implements regeneration of complex patterns to a specific target morphology. Correct regeneration depends on the form and the size of the cell structure, as well as on some parameters of regeneration."

Several studies have reported the genetic diversity of M. tuberculosis strains in Mexico, but little information is available from the state of Jalisco. Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine the genetic diversity of Mycobacterium tuberculosis clinical isolates from Western Mexico. Sixty-eight M. tuberculosis isolates were tested for susceptibility to first-line drugs using manual Mycobacteria Growth Indicator Tube method and genotyped using spoligotyping and IS6110-restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) pattern analyses. Forty-seven (69.1%) isolates were grouped into 10 clusters and 21 isolates displayed single patterns by spoligotyping. Three of the 21 single patterns corresponded to orphan patterns in the SITVITWEB database, and 1 new type that contained 2 isolates was created. The most prevalent lineages were T (38.2%), Haarlem (17.7%), LAM (17.7%), X (7.4%), S (5.9%), EAI (1.5%) and Beijing (1.5%). Six (12.8%) of the clustered isolates were MDR, and type 406 of the Beijing family was among the MDR isolates. Seventeen (26.2%) isolates were grouped into 8 clusters and 48 isolates displayed single patterns by IS6110-RFLP. Combination of IS6110-RFLP and spoligotyping reduced the clustering rate to 20.0%. The results show that T, Haarlem, and LAM are predominant lineages among clinical isolates of M. tuberculosis in Guadalajara, Mexico. Clustering rates indicated low transmission of MDR strains. We detected a rare Beijing genotype, SIT406, which was a highly resistant strain. This is the first report of this Beijing genotype in Latin America."

Alternatively spliced Cav1.2 Ca2+ channels have been found to be expressed in a tissue-specific manner or under pathological conditions. To provide a more comprehensive understanding of alternative splicing in Cav1.2 channel, we systematically investigated the splicing patterns in the neonatal and adult rat hearts. The neonatal heart expresses a novel 104-bp exon 33L at the IVS3-4 linker that is generated by the use of an alternative acceptor site. Inclusion of exon 33L causes frameshift and C-terminal truncation. Whole-cell electrophysiological recordings of Cav1.233L channels expressed in HEK 293 cells did not detect any current. However, when co-expressed with wild type Cav1.2 channels, Cav1.233L channels reduced the current density and altered the electrophysiological properties of the wild type Cav1.2 channels. Interestingly, the truncated 3.5-domain Cav1.233L channels also yielded a dominant negative effect on Cav1.3 channels, but not on Cav3.2 channels, suggesting that Cavβ subunits is required for Cav1.233L regulation. A biochemical study provided evidence that Cav1.233L channels enhanced protein degradation of wild type channels via the ubiquitin-proteasome system.

Voltage-gated calcium channels govern the depolarization-induced Ca2+ entry into cardiac muscles. The channel consists of a pore-forming α1 subunit associated with β, α2δ, and/or γ auxiliary subunits to form an oligomeric complex. In mammalian myocardium, excitation-contraction coupling is characterized by a transient increase in cytosolic Ca2+. The influx of Ca2+ through voltage-gated calcium channels subsequently induces Ca2+ release from sarcoplasmic reticulum in a process known as Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release. This process is prominent in the adult heart. The contraction of neonatal hearts relies more directly on the influx of Ca2+ through L-type voltage-gated calcium channels, in particular the Cav1.2 channels (1Vornanen M.

In brief, the PCR products were cloned into pGEM-T Easy vector (Promega). After being transformed into DH10B Escherichia coli cells, each transformant was selected and grown in a single well in a 96-well plate. Colony PCR was performed with the same set of primers and conditions to identify the component of exons in each colony. Usually 96 colonies were selected for each sample. The genotype of each PCR product amplified from a colony was predicted by size and randomly confirmed by DNA sequencing. To differentiate mutually exclusive exons that are of same size, restriction enzyme digestions were used to identify the expression of individual exons. The digestion was carried out in a 30-μl reaction volume at 37 °C for 5 h. To control for complete digestion, the same amount of PCR product of a positive control DNA was subjected to similar digestion conditions. Rat exon 33L was verified by DNA sequencing. The sequences were compared with rat genome sequence from the Human Genome Sequencing Center, Baylor College of Medicine. To characterize the functions of exon 33L containing channels, a fragment containing exon 33L was cloned into a wild type rat Cav1.2 channel with AvrII and NheI sites. This wild type Cav1.2 channel contains the exons predominantly expressed in rat cardiac tissues. Rat exon 33L was cloned in-frame into pGEX-4T-1. Amino acid sequences from adjacent exons were not included. GST-fused protein was purified with glutathione-agarose (Sigma). Purified protein was used to immunize female New Zealand White rabbit once a month. Complete Freund's adjuvant was first mixed with GST-33L for immunization, and incomplete Freund's adjuvant was used in subsequent injections once a month. Serum collected after immunization was preabsorbed with GST protein first to remove GST antibodies, and 33L polyclonal antibody was affinity-purified from immobilized 33L protein with an IgG elution buffer (Pierce). The antibody concentration is 1 μg/μl. Serum from rabbit before immunization was used as preimmune control. For protein isolation, heart tissues were homogenized in HEPES lysis buffer: 20 mmol/liter HEPES, 137 mmol/liter NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 1.5 mmol/liter MgCl2, and 1 mmol/liter EGTA supplemented with protease inhibitors (1:50 dilution, Roche Diagnostics). Homogenized samples were then centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 15 min, and supernatants containing protein samples were collected. Protein concentration was determined using Bradford assay. 200 μg of lysates were separated by 8% SDS-PAGE and transferred overnight at 30 V onto PVDF membranes at 4 °C. Subsequently, the membrane was blocked with 1% BSA in 1× PBS + 0.1% Tween 20 for 1 h and probed with primary antibodies overnight at 4 °C. The primary antibodies used in the study include rabbit anti-exon 33L polyclonal (1:5000), rabbit anti-Cav1.2 or CaV1.3 (1:1000, Alomone), mouse anti-ubiquitin (1:1000, Invitrogen), and mouse anti-β-actin (1:5000, Sigma). The next day, the membrane was washed 3 times with 0.1% Tween 20 in 1× PBS. The membrane was then probed with HRP-conjugated secondary antibody for 1 h. After washing, the band was detected using Amersham Biosciences ECL Western blotting Analysis System (RPN2109, GE Healthcare). Animals were sacrificed and perfused with saline and subsequently 4% paraformaldehyde. The heats were then collected and post-fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 2 h. Dehydration was subsequently carried out by immersing the hearts into 15% sucrose followed by 30% sucrose. Next, the rat heart was sectioned at 20 μm of thickness. After washing with 0.2% Triton X-100 phosphate-buffered saline (PBST), 100 μl of blocking serum (10% goat serum and 1% bovine serum albumin in 0.2% PBST) was added onto the sections for 1 h. The sections were then incubated with primary antibodies overnight at 4 °C. Monoclonal antibodies anticonnexin 43 (MAB 3068) was purchased from Chemicon International. On the following day, tissue sections were washed 3 times with TNT wash buffer (0.1 m Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, containing 0.15 m NaCl and 0.05% Tween 20). The slides were incubated with FITC-conjugated or Texas red-labeled secondary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature. After washing three times of wash buffer, the slides were mounted with FluorSaveTM reagent (Merck). The results were visualized using laser scanning confocal microscope system (Fluoview BX61, Olympus). The negative control was done in an identical procedure except for primary antibody incubation, and no positive signal was identified. HEK293 cells were transiently transfected with rat α1 (1.25 μg), β2a (1.25 μg), and α2δ (1.25 μg) subunits with the calcium phosphate transfection method. The GFP-tagged β2a and α2δ clones were provided by Dr. Terrance Snutch (University of British Columbia). The rat Cav3.2 channel and Cav1.3 channel were described earlier (15Tao J. Hildebrand M.E.

ICa was recorded with a whole-cell patch clamp technique at room temperature (∼25 °C) 48–72 h post-transfection. Patch electrodes were pulled using a Flaming/Brown micropipette puller (Sutter Instrument) and polished with a microforge. The external solution contained 140 mmol/liter tetraethylammonium methanesulfonate, 10 mmol/liter HEPES, and 1.8 mmol/liter CaCl2 (the pH was adjusted to 7.4 with CsOH and osmolarity to 300–310 mosm with glucose). For IBa recording, 1.8 mm Ca2+ was replaced by 5 mm Ba2+. The internal solution (pipette solution) contained 138 mmol/liter Cs-MeSO3, 5 mmol/liter CsCl2, 0.5 mmol/liter ethylene glycol tetraacetic acid, 10 mmol/liter HEPES, 1 mmol/liter MgCl2, and 2 mg/ml MgATP, pH 7.3 (adjusted with CsOH). The osmolarity was adjusted to between 290 and 300 mosm with glucose. Under voltage clamp and using an Axopatch 200B amplifier (Axon Instruments), whole-cell currents were filtered at 1–5 kHz and sampled at 5–50 kHz. The series resistance was normally <5 megaohms after compensation. The capacity transient was compensated using an online P/4 protocol. The steady-state inactivation curves were obtained from experiments by stepping from a holding potential of −90 mV to a 30-ms normalizing pulse to 10 mV followed by a family of 15-s-long prepulses from −80 to +20 mV. A 104-ms test pulse to +10 mV was recorded finally. Each test pulse was normalized to the maximal current amplitude of the normalizing pulse.

Although up to 20 exons are alternatively spliced (17Liao P. Zhang H.Y. Soong T.W. Alternative splicing of voltage-gated calcium channels: from molecular biology to disease.Pflugers Arch. 2009; 458: 481-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), only exons 31 and 32 have been reported to be developmentally regulated in the heart (18Diebold R.J.

Mutually exclusive exons 31 and 32 encode the IVS3 transmembrane segment and part of the IVS2-S3 intracellular linker, whereas another alternatively spliced exon 33 encodes the IVS3-S4 extracellular linker.

Enzyme digestion on exon 32 by NsiI produces two smaller fragments with the sizes of 68 and 314 bp, respectively (Fig. 1A). In the presence of exon 31, only one band exists (382 bp), as no digestion occurs. Deletion of the cassette exon 33 (33 nt in length) has rarely been found in rat hearts (8Liao P. Yu D. Li G. Yong T.F. Soon J.L. Chua Y.L. Soong T.W. A smooth muscle Cav1.2 calcium channel splice variant underlies hyperpolarized window current and enhanced state-dependent inhibition by nifedipine.J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 35133-35142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). When we digested RT-PCR products from the neonatal and adult rat hearts, partial digestions were observed in both samples, indicating that neonatal and adult hearts contain a mixture of exons 31 and 32. However, the extent of digestion by NsiI was different, as more PCR products from the adult hearts were digested than that from the neonatal hearts. Therefore, exon 32 expression is higher in adult rat hearts than in neonatal rat hearts (Fig. 1B). Such developmental changes of exon 31 and 32 have been reported by Diebold et al. (18Diebold R.J. Koch W.J. Ellinor P.T. Wang J.J. Muthuchamy M. Wieczorek D.F. Schwartz A. Mutually exclusive exon splicing of the cardiac calcium channel α1 subunit gene generates developmentally regulated isoforms in the rat heart.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1992; 89: 1497-1501Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), and our experiment supports the previous finding. Besides mutually exclusive exons 31, 32, and cassette exon 33, there exists an additional 66-nt extension at the 5′ end of exon 34 with different acceptor sites, producing exon 34a, an isoform of exon 34 (6Tiwari S. Zhang Y. Heller J. Abernethy D.R. Soldatov N.M. Atherosclerosis-related molecular alteration of the human Cav1.2 calcium channel α1C subunit.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 17024-17029Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). To characterize the detailed expression of exon 33 and 34a, we used the colony screening method that is able to detect exons of lower expression (8Liao P. Yu D. Li G. Yong T.F. Soon J.L. Chua Y.L. Soong T.W. A smooth muscle Cav1.2 calcium channel splice variant underlies hyperpolarized window current and enhanced state-dependent inhibition by nifedipine.J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 35133-35142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The inclusion or exclusion of exons 33 and/or 34a could be easily identified by differences in size of the PCR products, whereas mutually exclusive exons 31 and 32 cannot, as they are of the same length. Colony PCR screening showed that the size of the majority of colonies was ∼382 bp, indicating that the splice variants with exon 33 deletion or exon 34a inclusion are not predominant in neonatal and adult rat hearts (Fig. 2, A and B). DNA sequencing confirmed that the colonies with smaller size contained only exon 31 or 32 but with the exon 33 deletion. However, some colonies of a larger size have been found to appear more frequently in the neonatal heart than in the adult heart (indicated by arrows in Fig. 2, A and B). Subsequent DNA sequencing confirmed that these colonies did not contain exon 34a, but expressed a novel exon, which is named exon 33L here. We repeated RT-PCR-based colony screening experiments and confirmed that neonatal hearts (NH) express 9.7% of exon 33L, which represents a >2-fold increase to the 4.3% in adult hearts (AH) (Fig. 2C, p = 0.0127, NH (n = 5), AH (n = 5), Student's t test). Exon 33L contains an additional 71-nt 5′ to exon 33 (Fig. 3A). To understand the nature of this 71-nt fragment, we searched the rat genome sequence from the Human Genome Sequencing Center from Baylor College of Medicine. The mechanism for the generation of the additional 71-nt 5′ of exon 33 can be rationalized by the inspection of the genomic sequence of the rat Cav1.2 channel gene. These 71 nt locate at chromosome 4 and 5′ to exon 33 of the rat Cav1.2 gene. No genomic sequence was found between the 71 nt and exon 33. More importantly, the canonical -ag- acceptor dinucleotides were found 5′ to the 71 nt. Therefore, the inclusion of the 71 nt could be explained by the use of an alternate acceptor site of exon 33. However, the inclusion of 71 nt will result in a frameshift of the coding sequences and produce a premature stop codon (Fig. 3, A and B). As the premature stop codon appeared in the IVS3-4 linker, it will generate a truncated channel lacking the last three transmembrane segments of domain IV and the entire C terminus (Fig. 3C). Thus, there exists two isoforms of exon 33. One is the original 33-nt exon 33 and the other is the new 104-nt exon 33L (71 nt + 33 nt). We further compared the DNA sequencing results and found that exon 33L can be linked either with exon 31 or exon 32. To determine whether the aberrant splice variants are translated into proteins, a polyclonal antibody was generated against the 22-amino acid polypeptides encoded by exon 33L (Fig. 3A). The 22-amino acid polypeptides were expressed as a fusion protein with GST (Fig. 4A) and were injected into rabbits to produce exon 33L specific antibody α-33L. No adjacent amino acids were included for antibody production. Using α-33L, we detected by Western blot a band of 160 kDa in neonatal and adult hearts, having the same molecular mass of the truncated 33L containing Cav1.2 channel expressed in HEK 293 cells (Fig. 4B). Therefore, neonatal rat hearts expressed higher levels of Cav1.233L channel than adult hearts. To prove the specificity of α-33L antibody, HEK cells were transfected with Cav1.233L channel or the reference channel Cav1.2WT, which does not contain exon 33L. α-33L antibody stained Cav1.233-transfected cells but not Cav1.2WT-transfected cells (Fig. 4C). Next, we used an immunohistological method to examine the cellular expression of the Cav1.233L channel in rat hearts during development. Connexin 43 was labeled for the gap junctions between adjacent cardiac muscle cells. Again, α-33L staining showed a stronger fluorescent signal in neonatal heart than in adult heart, supporting a higher expression of Cav1.233L channel in neonatal rat heart (Fig. 4D). It should be noted that Cav1.233L did not colocalize with Connexin 43 in both neonatal and adult hearts, suggesting that the majority of Cav1.233L channels may not traffic to the plasma membrane. The functional significance of the inclusion of exon 33L in Cav1.2 channels has not been reported. We sought to assess exon 33L functions by whole-cell patch clamp recording. Exon 33L was cloned into a reference rat cardiac-form Cav1.2 channel that contained exon 1a and 8a, with the absence of exon 9* (8Liao P. Yu D. Li G. Yong T.F. Soon J.L. Chua Y.L. Soong T.W.

All these enzymes belong to the HD superfamily (9Aravind L. Koonin E.V. The HD domain defines a new superfamily of metal-dependent phosphohydrolases.Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 469-472Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar), as they have conserved His and Asp residues that are coordinated to a metal in a diverse group of phosphohydrolases. The focus of the current work is on the dGTPase of E. coli encoded by the dgt gene. Early studies had shown that deletion of the dgt gene led to a 2-fold increase in the cellular dGTP pool (10Quirk S. Bhatnagar S.K. Bessman M.J. Primary structure of the deoxyguanosine triphosphate triphosphohydrolase-encoding gene (dgt) of Escherichia coli.Gene. 1990; 89: 13-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), whereas its overexpression (optA1 strain) led to a 5-fold decrease in the dGTP level (11Myers J.A.

Despite these early findings, no cellular function of the enzyme could be described (2Seto D. Bhatnagar S.K. Bessman M.J. The purification and properties of deoxyguanosine triphosphate triphosphohydrolase from Escherichia coli.J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 1494-1499Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). More recently, our laboratory discovered that inactivation of the dgt gene produced a novel mutator phenotype (12Gawel D. Hamilton M.D. Schaaper R.M. A novel mutator of Escherichia coli carrying a defect in the dgt gene, encoding a dGTP triphosphohydrolase.J. Bacteriol. 2008; 190: 6931-6939Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). This effect, which suggested a fidelity function for the dgt gene, may be attributed to an increase in the cellular dGTP concentration resulting from the lack of Dgt function. Our laboratory has also demonstrated the involvement of the dgt gene in the thymine-salvage pathway by way of its role in producing deoxyguanosine, a compound critical for thymine salvage (13Itsko M. Schaaper R.M. The dgt gene of Escherichia coli facilitates thymine utilization in thymine-requiring strains.Mol. Microbiol. 2011; 81: 1221-1232Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Severe depletion of the dGTP pool by Dgt overproduction can actively kill E. coli (14Itsko M. Schaaper R.M. dGTP starvation in Escherichia coli provides new insights into the thymineless-death phenomenon.PLoS Genet. 2014; 10: e1004310Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) in a manner similar to the well known phenomenon of thymineless death (15Cohen S.S.

However, the role of this DNA-binding activity has not been defined. For human SAMHD1, DNA binding is required for the oligomerization of the protein, which in turn is required for its dNTPase activity (17Tüngler V. Staroske W. Kind B. Dobrick M. Kretschmer S.

There is no information available on the DNA-binding properties of other bacterial dNTPases. single-stranded DNA ligation independent cloning nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid enterokinase size exclusion chromatography multi-angle light scattering mismatch repair. Crystal structures of other bacterial dNTP triphosphohydrolases (TT1383, PA1124, PA3043, and EF1143) have revealed a domain architecture where the dNTPase exists as a hexamer, except for EF1143, which is a tetramer (4Mega R.

The crystal structure of the complex of EF1143 with its substrate (dATP bound at the active site) and activator (dGTP bound at the regulatory site) revealed an allosteric mechanism in which a dNTP in one site (regulatory site) promotes binding of a dNTP substrate molecule in the catalytic site (6Vorontsov I.I.

However, no structure of any protein-DNA complex is available that would elucidate the mode of DNA binding and its possible role in affecting the dNTPase activity. In the present work, we have obtained the first crystal structure of E. coli Dgt. Surprisingly, this crystal structure showed the presence of DNA in complex with the enzyme. In the structure, Dgt exists as a hexamer, containing two DNA units per hexamer. Mutation of the Dgt residues interacting with DNA lead to a complete loss of the DNA-binding activity. Genetic studies on an E. coli dgt mutant defective in DNA binding showed a modest mutator phenotype for A·T → G·C transition mutations. This is the first time that the DNA-binding activity of triphosphohydrolases has been explored. Our analysis of the DNA binding leads us to postulate a possible allosteric mechanism that links the catalytic site and the DNA-binding site of the dNTPase. The dgt gene was cloned under expression of the T7 promoter in plasmid pET30-Ek/LIC (pET30-dgt). The pET30-Ek/LIC vector introduced an N-terminal hexahistidine tag, which can be cleaved off due to the presence of an enterokinase protease site (Ek) just before the start of the gene sequence. Primers for amplification were designed to contain overhangs at the 5′- and 3′-termini (underlined in DNA sequence, see below) that allowed for the directional cloning of the gene into the vector. The entire gene from its ATG start codon to its TAA stop codon was amplified from genomic DNA using the TaqDNA polymerase kit (Invitrogen) using 5′-GACGACGACAAGATGGCACAGATTGATTTCCGA-3′ (forward primer) and 5′-CTCCTCTTCGGGCCTTATTGTTCTACGGCCATATCCCA-3′ (reverse primer) (Dgt start and stop codon in bold). After gel purification of the amplification product, a LIC (ligation independent cloning) reaction was performed using the pET-30 Ek/LIC Vector kit (Novagen). The insertion of the gene into the vector was confirmed by a restriction digestion reaction using BglII and BamHI, sites for which are present in the vector on either side of the dgt insert. The plasmid was then transformed into DH5α cells selecting for kanamycin-resistant (kanR) colonies. To confirm that there were no mutations created within the dgt gene during its amplification, DNA sequencing was performed using the Big Dye Terminator kit (Life Technologies) and 5 sequencing primers covering the entire dgt sequence. For Dgt overexpression studies, the plasmid, named pET30-dgt, was transformed into strain BL21(DE3). Three-liter cultures of BL21(DE3) containing pET30-dgt were grown at 37 °C in LB to A600 nm ∼ 0.5, at which point the temperature was reduced to 18 °C and expression was induced by addition of 0.5 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. After overnight incubation at 18 °C, the cells were harvested by centrifugation. Three slightly different Dgt purification protocols were used throughout the study, as detailed below. Cell lysis was performed in the presence of Bugbuster (Novagen), lysozyme (Sigma), and Benzonase. After high-speed centrifugation, the lysate was purified over a Ni-NTA column at room temperature, as further described in protocol 2. The His6 tag at the N-terminal of Dgt was cleaved off using the protease enterokinase (Ek). This particular protocol led to a Dgt preparation containing enzyme-bound DNA. The salt concentration in the lysis solution was 25 mm, as per the manufacturer's instructions. This modified protocol was developed to minimize DNA contamination of purified Dgt. Cells were grown as described in protocol 1, but lysis was performed by addition of Bugbuster, lysozyme, and 2 m NaCl, thus creating high-salt conditions and omitting the Benzonase. After centrifugation at 30,000 × g for 30 min, 6% (w/v) PEG 6000, and 5% (w/v) dextran 500 were added to the clear supernatant to precipitate out any remaining DNA. The clear upper phase obtained after a high-speed spin was then loaded on the Ni-NTA column and the purification was performed at room temperature. The Ni-NTA resin packed in a column was equilibrated with 5–10 column volumes of equilibration buffer from the HisTALON buffer set (Clontech). The lysate containing Dgt was loaded on the column and the resin was further washed with a wash buffer containing 10 mm imidazole. Finally the protein was eluted using the elution buffer (Clontech). The purity of protein was analyzed on an SDS-PAGE gel, and after cleaving off the histidine tag the protein was concentrated to 7 mg/ml and stored at −80 °C. This protocol yielded an essentially DNA-free enzyme preparation, which was used for crystallography of the DNA-free enzyme. Cells were grown as described in protocol 1. Lysis and purification were performed at 4 °C. For lysis, cell pellets were resuspended and sonicated in 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 m NaCl, 10% (w/v) sucrose, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 2–3 tablets of EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science), and lysozyme (Sigma). Polyethyleneimine to a final concentration of 0.3% (v/v) was added to the lysate to further reduce DNA contamination. A clear supernatant containing the protein was obtained by high-speed centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 30 min. The protein was fractionated from the supernatant by the addition of solid ammonium sulfate to 50% (w/v), over a period of 10 min on ice. The precipitated protein was collected using high-speed centrifugation, and the pellet was resuspended in 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 2 mm EDTA, 15% (v/v) glycerol, and 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol. Before purification the protein was dialyzed overnight against 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl. The dialyzed protein was purified using Ni-NTA-agarose resin (Qiagen) using a batch procedure. The resin was equilibrated with 25 mm sodium/potassium phosphate, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl. The protein was incubated with the equilibrated resin for 45 min and then washed with a solution of 25 mm sodium/potassium phosphate, pH 8.0, 2 m NaCl, and 5 mm imidazole, pH 8.0. Finally the protein was eluted from the resin in a step gradient using 25 mm sodium/potassium phosphate, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, and 200 mm imidazole. After cleaving off the histidine tag, the purified protein was dialyzed overnight against 25 mm Tris·HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mm MgCl2, and 75 mm sodium citrate (buffer A). Dgt was concentrated using a 10,000 MWCO concentrator (Millipore) before freezing the enzyme in small aliquots at −80 °C at a concentration of 15 mg/ml. Dgt purified using protocol 3 was used for DNA binding studies as well as activity assays in the presence and absence of DNA. In all cases, the histidine tag was removed by enterokinase. Dgt protein was analyzed on a Superdex 200 16/60 size exclusion column to investigate its oligomerization state in solution. Protein elution was measured at 280 nm. The Dgt molecular weight was determined by comparing its elution volume to molecular weight standards (thyroglobulin, γ-globulin, ovalbumin, myoglobin, and vitamin B12) and by SEC-MALS (size exclusion chromatography multi-angle light scattering) using the miniDAWNTM TREOS® connected to a Superdex 200 10/30 column. Crystals of Dgt protein were grown by the sitting-drop vapor diffusion method by mixing 2 μl of protein solution (10 mg/ml of dGTPase) with 2 μl of well solution 1 (0.1 m sodium acetate, 8% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 4000, pH 4.6) and incubation at room temperature (20 °C). Crystals appeared in a few days. For data collection, crystals were transferred to a cryoprotectant solution (crystallization solution plus 25% (v/v) ethylene glycol) and flash cooled in liquid nitrogen. Crystals of Dgt without any bound DNA (see protocol 2) were produced similarly with a protein solution containing 1 mm deoxy-CCC and a well solution of 0.5 m ammonium sulfate, 0.1 m sodium citrate, 1.0 m lithium sulfate, pH 5.6. X-ray data were collected at beamline 22-ID of the Advanced Photon Source at Argonne National Laboratory in Chicago. All data reduction and scaling was performed using the HKL2000 data processing software (20Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Processing of x-ray diffraction data collected in oscillation mode.Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38527) Google Scholar). The structure was phased by molecular replacement using the structure of dGTPase from Pseudomonas syringae (PDB accession 2PGS). Maps were improved using solvent flattening and 6-fold non-crystallographic averaging using density modifications (21Cowtan K.D. Zhang K.Y.

Structure refinement was done using NCS restraints on Dgt monomers each divided into six rigid subdomains, with some loops excluded. Final refinement of the DNA-bound structure restrained chain A with B, and grouped chains C through F. The final model displays reasonable Ramachandran geometry (favored 93.6%, outliers 1.2%). The S34D/G37E double mutation was generated in plasmid pET30-dgt using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The oligonucleotides containing the double mutations (underlined) were 5′-CGGATCTTCGAGGATGATCGCGAACGTATCATCAACTCTCCG-3′ and 5′-CGGAGAGTTGATGATACGTTCGCGATCATCCTCGAAGATCCG-3′. The presence of both mutations within dgt was confirmed using DNA sequencing. The dGTP substrate was modeled by superposition of the active site region with the structure of SAMHD1 bound to dGTP (Protein Data Bank 4MZ7) (26Zhu C. Gao W. Zhao K. Qin X. Zhang Y. Peng X. Zhang L. Dong Y. Zhang W. Li P. Wei W. Gong Y. Yu X.F. Structural insight into dGTP-dependent activation of tetrameric SAMHD1 deoxynucleoside triphosphate triphosphohydrolase.Nat. Commun. 2013; 4: 2722Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). In the reference structure, the triphosphate is shifted away from the active site due to the use of the non-catalytic metal Zn+2. Therefore, the triphosphate group was modeled to approximate a catalytically competent orientation with Pα near the active site metal, and the remaining two phosphates near residues Lys-211 and Lys-232. Single-stranded DNA or RNA (22-mer) containing a fluorescein label at the 5′ end (HPLC purified, purchased from Sigma) of the following sequence was used for binding studies to Dgt: 5′-TTGTACATTTCTCTCCTTGTCT-3′. The DNA or RNA was resuspended in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, and 0.1 mm EDTA at a concentration of 35 nm. An Olis RSM1000 spectrofluorometer (Bogart, GA) was used to measure the steady-state fluorescence anisotropy at 22 °C. The excitation wavelength was 480 nm and the emission wavelength was 520 nm. The protein concentration was varied from 0 to 1000 nm, and the changes in the fluorescence anisotropy (r) were measured in response to the stepwise addition of the protein. The data were fit to a quadratic equation (27Heyduk T. Lee J.C. Application of fluorescence energy transfer and polarization to monitor Escherichia coli cAMP receptor protein and lac promoter interaction.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1990; 87: 1744-1748Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar) via nonlinear regression using Kaleidagraph version 3.6 software to obtain the dissociation constant (Kd) values. dGTPase activity of the Dgt protein was measured using an enzyme-coupled assay in which deoxyguanosine (the product of dGTP hydrolysis by Dgt) is converted into 8-oxoguanine by the action of purine nucleoside phosphorylase and xanthine oxidase. The details of this assay will be described elsewhere. 3A. Hochkoeppler, D. Singh, and R. M. Schaaper, manuscript in preparation. Briefly, the reaction mixture contained 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 5 mm MgCl2, 50 milliunits/ml of purine nucleoside phosphorylase (Sigma), 500 milliunits/ml of xanthine oxidase (Sigma), 5 mm sodium phosphate, and a desired dGTP concentration. To start the reaction, Dgt enzyme was added (4 nm, final concentration in 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 5 mm MgCl2). The reaction was performed in a 1-cm pathway quartz cuvette inside a Beckman Coulter DU-640 spectrophotometer. The formation of 8-oxoguanine was monitored continuously at 297 nm, and the rate of the reaction was determined from the linear slope of the absorbance increase. To analyze enzyme activity in the presence of DNA, a single-stranded DNA 40-mer (5′-ATGCTAGCTTGGCTGTGACTTTAAACCTGTCGTGCCAGCT-3′) was included in the reaction mixture. Prior to initiation of the reaction, Dgt enzyme was preincubated at 37 °C for 20 min (2Seto D. Bhatnagar S.K. Bessman M.J.

The rate data were fit to the Hill equation (28Hill A.V. The possible effects of the aggregation of the molecules of haemoglobin on its dissociation curves.J. Physiol. 1910; 40: iv-viiiGoogle Scholar) using nonlinear regression on Kaleidagraph software version 3.6. To achieve replacement of the wild-type dgt gene on the chromosome with the DNA-binding defective S34D/G37E variant, we used the splicing by overlap extension-LRed method, which uses both splicing by overlap extension PCR and the λRed system (29Benson R.W. Cafarelli T.M. Godoy V.G. SOE-LRed: A simple and time-efficient method to localize genes with point mutations onto the Escherichia coli chromosome.J. Microbiol. Methods. 2011; 84: 479-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Using this method, the wild-type and mutant dgt gene were fused to a kanamycin-resistant (kan) gene serving as selectable marker. Three separate PCR were used to amplify the wild-type dgt gene (from pET30-dgt), dgt mutant gene (from pET30-dgt S34D/G37E), and the kan gene (from plasmid pKD4) (30Datsenko K.A. Wanner B.L.

Primers (listed below) were designed so that 50-bp extensions (capital letters) were added at the 5′ and 3′ ends of each amplification product. The four primers used were: forward primer (FP1) and reverse primer (RP1) for amplifying the dgt gene (lowercase letters) along with its promoter region (underlined), and FP2 and RP2 to amplify the kan gene (lowercase letters) from plasmid pKD4 (30Datsenko K.A.

Primers RP1 and FP2 had a common linker region (italicized) that could be used to fuse the dgt gene to the kanR gene in a subsequent step. The primer sequences are as follows: FP1, 5′-GCATAGTTTACCATGCGCTTACGGGGAAGCGTATTTCTCACGCGGGAGAGGACatggcacagattgatttccg-3′; RP1, 5′-CTCTATGCGTGGGATGAATACCGACGTCTGATGGCCGTAGAACAAtaaccaggcttttgtaaagacgaac-3′; FP2, 5′-GGGATGAATACCGACGTCTGATGGCCGTAGAACAAtaaCCccggaattgccagctggggcgccctctggt-3′; and RP2, 5′-gccttcttgacgagttcttctgaAGGCTTTTGTAAAGACGAACAATAAATTTTTACCTTTTGCAGAAACTTTAGTTCGGAACT-3′. In the next step, the dgt and dgt S34D/G37E PCR products were each separately amplified together with the amplified kan gene with primers FP1 and RP2, leading to a PCR product in which the kan and dgt genes were joined. The fusion PCR products were electroporated into BW25113 cells containing plasmid pKD46, which expresses the phage λRed proteins under control of an arabinose-inducible promoter (30Datsenko K.A.

For efficient recovery of the desired recombinants, the dgt gene in BW25113 was first replaced with a chloramphenicol-resistant variant (Δdgt::cam) (12Gawel D. Hamilton M.D. Schaaper R.M.

https://openalex.org/W2029707422,"Replicative DNA polymerases are high fidelity enzymes that misincorporate nucleotides into nascent DNA with a frequency lower than [1/105], and this precision is improved to about [1/107] by their proofreading activity. Because this fidelity is insufficient to replicate most genomes without error, nature evolved postreplicative mismatch repair (MMR), which improves the fidelity of DNA replication by up to 3 orders of magnitude through correcting biosynthetic errors that escaped proofreading. MMR must be able to recognize non-Watson-Crick base pairs and excise the misincorporated nucleotides from the nascent DNA strand, which carries by definition the erroneous genetic information. In eukaryotes, MMR is believed to be directed to the nascent strand by preexisting discontinuities such as gaps between Okazaki fragments in the lagging strand or breaks in the leading strand generated by the mismatch-activated endonuclease of the MutL homologs PMS1 in yeast and PMS2 in vertebrates. We recently demonstrated that the eukaryotic MMR machinery can make use also of strand breaks arising during excision of uracils or ribonucleotides from DNA. We now show that intermediates of MutY homolog-dependent excision of adenines mispaired with 8-oxoguanine (GO) also act as MMR initiation sites in extracts of human cells or Xenopus laevis eggs. Unexpectedly, GO/C pairs were not processed in these extracts and failed to affect MMR directionality, but extracts supplemented with exogenous 8-oxoguanine DNA glycosylase (OGG1) did so.

In Gram-negative bacteria such as Escherichia coli, the newly synthesized strand remains transiently unmethylated on adenines within GATC sequences. Mismatch-activated MutS-MutL complex licenses MutH to incise the unmethylated GATC, which allows the loading of the UvrD helicase together with one of several exonucleases. This leads to the degradation of the error-containing strand from the MutH-catalyzed nick toward and some distance past the mismatch to generate a single-stranded gap that is subsequently filled in by polymerase III. The remaining nick is sealed by DNA ligase (1Jiricny J. The multifaceted mismatch-repair system.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2006; 7: 335-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (952) Google Scholar, 2Lahue R.S.

In eukaryotes, DNA methylation is not used in strand discrimination during MMR. Instead, the nascent strand is distinguished from the template by transient discontinuities such as gaps between Okazaki fragments in the lagging strand. The leading strand contains no such discontinuities other than the 3′ terminus. Because the only MMR-associated exonuclease identified to date, EXO1, has an obligate 5′ to 3′ polarity, it appeared unlikely that MMR would use the 3′ terminus of the primer strand for initiation. However, seminal work from Modrich and co-workers (4Peña-Diaz J. Jiricny J. PCNA and MutLα: partners in crime in triplet repeat expansion?.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2010; 107: 16409-16410Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 5Pluciennik A. Dzantiev L. Iyer R.R. Constantin N. Kadyrov F.A. Modrich P.

U.S.A. 2010; 107: 16066-16071Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar) demonstrated that association of the mismatch-activated MutLα (a heterodimer of MLH1 and PMS2) with proliferating cell nuclear antigen bound at the 3′ terminus activates a cryptic endonuclease in the PMS2 subunit, which introduces nicks into the newly synthesized strand and thus provides EXO1 with entry sites where 5′ to 3′ degradation of the error-containing strand can initiate. While studying the involvement of MMR in somatic hypermutation, which is triggered by activation-induced cytidine deaminase that converts cytosines to uracils at the immunoglobulin locus of activated B cells (6Neuberger M.S. Di Noia J.M. Beale R.C. Williams G.T. Yang Z. Rada C. Somatic hypermutation at A·T pairs: polymerase error versus dUTP incorporation.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2005; 5: 171-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), we discovered that the MMR system can hijack strand breaks generated by the base excision repair (BER) system during uracil removal for the purpose of strand discrimination (7Schanz S. Castor D. Fischer F. Jiricny J. Interference of mismatch and base excision repair during the processing of adjacent U/G mispairs may play a key role in somatic hypermutation.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 5593-5598Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). This was unexpected because BER was thought to be a concerted process in which the strand break generated by apurinic endonuclease (APE1) after removal of the aberrant base is not available for other processes of DNA metabolism (8Dianov G.L. Hübscher U. Mammalian base excision repair: the forgotten archangel.Nucleic Acids Res. 2013; 41: 3483-3490Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). In later experiments, we showed that breaks generated during the RNase H2-catalyzed removal of ribonucleotides misincorporated into DNA during replication can also be utilized by MMR as strand discrimination signals (9Ghodgaonkar M.M. Lazzaro F. Olivera-Pimentel M. Artola-Borán M. Cejka P. Reijns M.A. Jackson A.P. Plevani P. Muzi-Falconi M. Jiricny J. Ribonucleotides misincorporated into DNA act as strand-discrimination signals in eukaryotic mismatch repair.Mol. Cell. 2013; 50: 323-332Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The above experiments suggested that strand breaks arising during different processes of DNA metabolism may be hijacked by MMR. Although this might lead to improved replication fidelity when breaks in the nascent DNA strand were involved, the opposite would be true if breaks in the template strand were used to direct the MMR process. To gain novel insight into this phenomenon, we set out to examine the interplay between MMR and oxidative DNA damage metabolism because BER-mediated processing of oxidized DNA could potentially take place on both nascent and template strands. Depending on cell type, human genomes have been estimated to harbor steady-state levels of the major product of DNA oxidation, 2′-deoxy-8-oxoguanosine, ranging between 1000 and 100,000 residues (10Collins A.R.

Muller J.G. Oxidative nucleobase modifications leading to strand scission.Chem. Rev. 1998; 98: 1109-1152Crossref PubMed Scopus (1620) Google Scholar). This nucleoside can be present in DNA in two distinct contexts: either paired with deoxycytidine or mispaired with deoxyadenosine because the base, 8-oxoguanine (GO), can adopt either an anti or a syn conformation about the glycosidic bond (13David S.S. O'Shea V.L. Kundu S. Base-excision repair of oxidative DNA damage.Nature. 2007; 447: 941-950Crossref PubMed Scopus (887) Google Scholar, 14McAuley-Hecht K.E. Leonard G.A. Gibson N.J. Thomson J.B.

Thus, although oxidation of double-stranded DNA gives rise solely to GO/C pairs in which GO is in the anti conformation, the replicative polymerases α, δ, and ϵ could insert either a C opposite anti-GO to form a Watson-Crick-like GO/C base pair or an A opposite syn-GO to form a Hoogsteen GO/A mispair (15Shibutani S.

Oxidation also affects the nucleotide pool where it generates dGOTP. However, because this nucleotide is hydrolyzed by MutT homolog 1 (MTH1) protein to dGOMP (18Sakumi K. Furuichi M. Tsuzuki T. Kakuma T. Kawabata S. Maki H. Sekiguchi M. Cloning and expression of cDNA for a human enzyme that hydrolyzes 8-oxo-dGTP, a mutagenic substrate for DNA synthesis.J. Biol.

Thus, in newly replicated DNA, all GO residues should be in the template strand, and all As mispaired with GO should be in the nascent strand. This point is key to our understanding of the potential interplay between oxidative damage processing and MMR. GO/C base pairs are addressed primarily by 8-oxoguanine DNA glycosylase (OGG1), a glycosylase/lyase that removes the oxidized base and cleaves the sugar-phosphate backbone to initiate a BER process that ultimately replaces the oxidized nucleotide with a dGMP (13David S.S. O'Shea V.L. Kundu S. Base-excision repair of oxidative DNA damage.Nature. 2007; 447: 941-950Crossref PubMed Scopus (887) Google Scholar). GO/As are not addressed by OGG1; they are recognized by the MutY homolog (MYH) glycosylase, which removes the mispaired adenines to initiate a BER process that inserts Cs opposite the oxidized guanines. The GO/Cs arising in this way can then be repaired later to G/C by OGG1-dependent BER (21Michaels M.L. Miller J.H. The GO system protects organisms from the mutagenic effect of the spontaneous lesion 8-hydroxyguanine (7,8-dihydro-8-oxoguanine).J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 6321-6325Crossref PubMed Scopus (610) Google Scholar, 22Fortini P. Pascucci B. Parlanti E. D'Errico M. Simonelli V. Dogliotti E. 8-Oxoguanine DNA damage: at the crossroad of alternative repair pathways.Mutat. Res. 2003; 531: 127-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Thus, if MMR were to use breaks generated during MYH-initiated BER of GO/As, these discontinuities would be in the nascent strand, and their hijacking by MMR might improve the efficiency of the latter process. In contrast, incisions made during OGG1-initiated BER of GO/Cs would be in the template strand where they would not only misdirect the mismatch repair process to the wrong strand but where they could also give rise to double strand breaks that could cause replication fork collapse. In an attempt to learn whether MMR utilized strand breaks arising during MYH- and/or OGG1-initiated BER processes, we generated substrates containing a single nick (a bona fide strand discrimination signal), a GO/A mispair, or a GO/C pair and studied the efficiency and directionality of MMR-catalyzed repair of a G/T mismatch situated in the vicinity. We show that, in extracts of human cells or Xenopus laevis eggs, the MMR excision machinery can use strand breaks arising upon MYH-catalyzed removal of adenines from GO/A mispairs as initiation sites for exonucleolytic degradation of error-containing strands on circular heteroduplex substrates. A similar phenomenon was not observed either on GO/C-containing heteroduplexes or on substrates containing 2-hydroxyadenine (AO), another product of purine oxidation (12Burrows C.J. Muller J.G. Oxidative nucleobase modifications leading to strand scission.Chem. Rev. 1998; 98: 1109-1152Crossref PubMed Scopus (1620) Google Scholar), even though AO/C and AO/G mispairs were reported previously to be addressed by MYH (23Ohtsubo T. Nishioka K. Imaiso Y. Iwai S.

All restriction enzymes were purchased from New England Biolabs. GST-tagged MYH was expressed from the pET41a-MYH expression vector (a gift from Dr. Barbara van Loon) and partially purified using glutathione-Sepharose beads (GE Healthcare) as described previously (25van Loon B. Hübscher U. An 8-oxo-guanine repair pathway coordinated by MUTYH glycosylase and DNA polymerase λ.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 18201-18206Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). In a second purification step, eluates were loaded onto a HiTrapTM Heparin HP column (GE Healthcare), which was then washed with 10 column volumes of wash buffer (30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 0.1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 1 mm DTT, 50 mm NaCl) at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. Elution was performed using a salt gradient (50–600 mm NaCl). MYH-GST was eluted with 400–500 mm NaCl. The active fractions were identified using a MYH nicking assay, pooled, aliquoted, and stored at −80 °C. Recombinant APE1 was purchased from New England Biolabs. Recombinant OGG1 was a kind gift from Barbara van Loon. Recombinant OGG1-GST was purchased from Trevigen (4130-100-EB). Recombinant MutLα and MutSα were expressed and purified in our laboratory as described previously (26Dufner P. Marra G. Räschle M. Jiricny J.

The expression constructs for human geminin (geminin-pET28) and p27 (p27-pET21) were a kind gift from Yoshi Hashimoto and Vincenzo Costanzo. Briefly, protein expression was induced with 0.5 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside in BL21 cells (Invitrogen) grown at 37 °C. The cell pellets were resuspended in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 500 mm KCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and PMSF for lysis. After cell disruption and centrifugation of cell debris and membranes, the soluble fraction containing 10 mm imidazole was loaded onto a nickel-chelating column, which was then washed with 5–25 mm imidazole. The protein was eluted with a gradient of 50–300 mm imidazole. Fractions containing the desired polypeptides were pooled and dialyzed against EB buffer (100 mm KCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 50 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, 10% glycerol). HCT116 (MutLα-deficient) and HCT116 + chromosome 3 (MutLα-proficient) cells were obtained from Richard Boland (27Koi M. Umar A. Chauhan D.P. Cherian S.P. Carethers J.M. Kunkel T.A. Boland C.R.

The medium for the chromosome 3-complemented cell line was supplemented with 400 μg/ml G418. LoVo (MutSα-deficient) cells were grown in DMEM (Gibco) supplemented with 10% bovine calf serum. All media additionally contained 1% penicillin/streptomycin. Nuclei were isolated as described previously (28Iaccarino I. Marra G. Palombo F.

NaCl was added dropwise to a final concentration of 150 mm, and extraction continued for 1 h at 4 °C. The nuclei were pelleted by centrifugation at 14,500 × g for 20 min at 4 °C in a tabletop centrifuge. The supernatant was transferred and dialyzed 2 × 1 h at 4 °C against 1 liter of cold dialysis buffer (25 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, 50 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 231 mm sucrose, 1 mm PMSF, 2 mm DTT, 1 μg/ml leupeptin). The dialyzed extract was clarified by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was aliquoted, snap frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C. The protein concentration was determined with the Bradford assay, and the salt concentration was measured using a conductivity meter. S phase extract was prepared as described previously (29Kubota Y. Takisawa H. Determination of initiation of DNA replication before and after nuclear formation in Xenopus egg cell free extracts.J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1321-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Briefly, eggs were dejellied, activated with calcium ionophore (Sigma-Aldrich), rinsed with S buffer (50 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, 50 mm KCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 250 mm sucrose), transferred to 2-ml Eppendorf tubes, and crushed by centrifugation for 12 min at 13,200 rpm. The cytoplasmic layer was removed and after addition of CytB (Sigma-Aldrich) cleared by centrifugation for 25 min at 70,000 rpm (Sorvall TL55 swinging bucket rotor). The extract was supplemented with 250 μg/μl cycloheximide, 25 mm phosphocreatine, and 10 μg/ml creatine phosphokinase before use. Whole cell extracts of the cell lines were prepared using 2× Laemmli buffer (120 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 4% SDS, 20% glycerol). Upon determination of the protein concentration by the Lowry assay, proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE. Western blot analyses were carried out using standard procedures. The following antibodies and dilutions were used: MYH (mouse monoclonal, Abcam, ab55551), 1:333; OGG1 (rabbit monoclonal, Abcam, ab124741),1:10,000; MSH6 (mouse monoclonal, BD Transduction Laboratories, 610919), 1:1000; MSH2 (mouse monoclonal, Calbiochem, NA-27), 1:500; MLH1 (mouse monoclonal, BD Transduction Laboratories, 554073), 1:500; and TF II H (rabbit polyclonal, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-293), 1:1000. The anti-MTH1 antibody was a generous gift from Yusaku Nakabeppu and was used at a dilution of 1:250. Horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-coupled anti-mouse and anti-rabbit secondary antibodies (GE Healthcare) were used at a dilution of 1:5000. The detailed procedure was described previously (30Baerenfaller K. Fischer F. Jiricny J.

Briefly, hetero- and homoduplexes were constructed by primer extension on single-stranded phagemid templates. The templates differed in the position of the Nt.BstNBI site, which was situated at nucleotide 2850 either in the viral (top) or complementary (bottom) strand. Incubation of the substrates with the nickase yielded substrates in which MMR occurred either 5′ to 3′ or 3′ to 5′, respectively. The mismatches were located within a SalI and/or AclI restriction site, which was restored upon repair. The desired closed-circular heteroduplex substrates were purified on cesium chloride gradients. The GO- or AO-containing primers were obtained from Eurogentec (Seraing, Belgium). All other primers were obtained from Microsynth (Balgach, Switzerland). The SalI (GTCGAC) and AclI (AACGTT) restriction sites are highlighted in bold and gray, respectively. PvuI restriction sites (CGATCG) are italicized, and mispaired residues are underlined. Primer sequences correspond to the outer strand sequence of the substrate. The substrates and the primer/template combinations are listed in Table 1.TABLE 1Oligonucleotide primers used to generate the MMR substratesa Template was pRichi-2850topAclI.b Template was pRichi-2850botAclI.c Template was pRichi-2850topSalI. Open table in a new tab a Template was pRichi-2850topAclI. b Template was pRichi-2850botAclI. c Template was pRichi-2850topSalI. 200 ng of the substrates were incubated with 10 ng of purified recombinant MYH-GST and 10 units of APE1 (New England Biolabs) in 1× MMR buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 40 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm glutathione, 50 μg/ml BSA, 0.1 mm dNTPs) for 4 h at 37 °C. The reaction was stopped by heat inactivation, and 50 ng of the prenicked substrate were analyzed on a 1% GelRed-stained agarose gel for nicking efficiency. The remaining 100 ng of the prenicked substrate were used in a MMR assay. 1 μg of GO/C-G/T substrate was incubated with 0.8 μg of purified recombinant OGG1 in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.1 mg/ml BSA for 2.5 h at 37 °C and subsequently purified on a MinElute Spin column (Qiagen). 100 ng of the prenicked substrate were used in a MMR assay. Closed-circular DNA substrates (100 ng) were incubated with 1 unit of Nt.BstNBI (New England Biolabs) according to the recommendations of the manufacturer. Subsequently, they were purified on a MinElute Spin column and used in MMR assays. 100 ng of closed-circular GO/A, AO/G, AO/C, or homoduplex substrate were incubated with 10 ng of purified recombinant MYH-GST, 10 units of APE1, and 1.5 mm ATP in 1× MMR buffer in a total volume of 10 μl. For time course experiments, 5-μl aliquots were withdrawn at the indicated time points. The reactions were stopped by the addition of 2 μl of 6× loading dye (37.5 mg/ml Ficoll 400, 23% glycerol, 0.03% bromphenol blue) and subsequent heat inactivation. The samples were separated on 1% agarose gels and visualized with GelRed. The nicking efficiency was quantified from the ratio of the amount of open-circular DNA product to the total amount of DNA (closed-circular + open-circular). The MMR assays were described previously (7Schanz S. Castor D. Fischer F. Jiricny J.

Mechanisms in eukaryotic mismatch repair.J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 30305-30309Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). Unless otherwise specified, the reactions were carried out with 100 ng of substrate and 100 μg of nuclear cell extract in a total volume of 25 μl in a buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm glutathione, 50 μg/ml BSA, 0.1 mm dNTPs, 1.5 mm ATP, and 80 mm KCl (in experiments involving MYH-addressed substrates) or 110 mm KCl (in experiments involving OGG1-addressed substrates). 1.8 pmol of purified MutLα or MutSα were added where indicated. The reactions were incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. The reaction was stopped by adding an equal volume of STOP solution (50% Proteinase K, 1 mm EDTA, 3% SDS) and subsequent incubation for 1 h at 50 °C. Substrates were purified on MinElute spin columns and subjected to SalI/DraI or AclI restriction digestion, and the DNA fragments were separated on 1% agarose gels stained with GelRed. The percentage of mismatch repair was quantified from the ratio of the repaired bands (c + d) to the total amount of DNA (c + d + (c + d)) using ImageQuantTL. The band intensities were corrected according to their respective DNA fragment sizes. Some assays were supplemented with 2 μCi of [α-32P]dATP. To monitor incorporation of the radiolabeled nucleotide, the agarose gels were vacuum-dried, exposed to a Phosphor Screen, and scanned with a Typhoon Scanner (FLA 9500, GE Healthcare). Briefly, the reaction mixture containing 150 ng of substrate, 26 μl of S phase extract, and 2 μCi of [α-32P]dATP in a total volume of 30 μl was incubated at 23 °C for 45 min. To inhibit replication, 500 nm geminin and 40 μg/ml p27 were added. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 70 μl of STOP solution (76 mm EDTA, 1.5% SDS) and 40 μg of RNase (Sigma-Aldrich) and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. Subsequently, 200 μg of Proteinase K (AppliChem) were added, and incubation continued at 37 °C overnight. The substrates were purified on MinElute Spin columns and subjected to SalI/DraI or AclI restriction digestion in the presence of RNase. The digested DNA was cleaned up again and analyzed on a 1% agarose gel stained with GelRed. 20 μl of Protein A/G PLUS-agarose beads (sc-2003, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were washed twice with 750 μl of binding buffer (30 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.6, 7 mm MgCl2) and spun down at 2700 × g for 2 min at 4 °C. The beads were resuspended in binding buffer, and 1 μg anti-MYH or anti-MSH6 antibody was added. The mixture was then incubated for 3 h at 4 °C, the beads were washed three times with 750 μl of binding buffer, and subsequently used to immunodeplete 100 μg of nuclear cell extracts for 30 min at 4 °C. MMR assays were performed immediately after depletion. Mock-depleted nuclear cell extracts were obtained by incubation with beads only. This assay was used to test MMR or BER activities. It was performed similarly to the MMR assay except for the following modifications. To track MMR-, MYH-, or OGG1-dependent nucleotide incorporation, the reactions were supplemented with 2 μCi of [α-32P]dATP, [α-32P]dCTP, or [α-32P]dGTP, respectively. Finally, the substrates were digested with NotI/BsaI and analyzed on a GelRed-stained 1% agarose gel. Repair tracts of up to 330 bp in Nt.BstNBI-nicked substrates, up to 29 bp in the GO/A substrates, and up to 22 bp in the GO/C substrates are seen in the 1808-bp fragment a. Longer repair tracts appear in the 1387-bp fragment b (see Fig. 1A). Although MMR-dependent [32P]dAMP incorporation gave rise to a strong radioactive signal in both bands, MYH-dependent [32P]dCMP or OGG1-dependent [32P]dGMP incorporation occurred only in DNA fragment a. Quantification of [32P]dCMP or [32P]dGMP incorporation in MYH- or OGG1-induced BER was determined from the ratio between the band intensities of fragment a on the autoradiographs and on the GelRed-stained agarose gels.

We previously showed that Rab35 promotes neurite outgrowth of nerve growth factor-stimulated PC12 cells through interaction with centaurin-β2 (also called ACAP2). Centaurin-β2 is the only Rab35-binding protein reported thus far that exclusively recognizes Rab35 and does not recognize any of the other 59 Rabs identified in mammals, but the molecular basis for the exclusive specificity of centaurin-β2 for Rab35 has remained completely unknown. In this study, we performed deletion and mutation analyses and succeeded in identifying the residues of Rab35 and centaurin-β2 that are crucial for formation of a Rab35·centaurin-β2 complex. We found that two threonine residues (Thr-76 and Thr-81) in the switch II region of Rab35 are responsible for binding centaurin-β2 and that the same residues are dispensable for Rab35 recognition by other Rab35-binding proteins. We also determined the minimal Rab35-binding site of centaurin-β2 and identified two asparagine residues (Asn-610 and Asn-691) in the Rab35-binding site as key residues for its specific Rab35 recognition. We further showed by knockdown-rescue approaches that neither a centaurin-β2 binding-deficient Rab35(T76S/T81A) mutant nor a Rab35 binding-deficient centaurin-β2(N610A/N691A) mutant supported neurite outgrowth of PC12 cells, thereby demonstrating the functional significance of the Rab35/centaurin-β2 interaction during neurite outgrowth of PC12 cells.

Because mammalian cells and tissues are highly specialized, the presence of multiple Rab effectors may enable a single Rab isoform to control different types (or steps) of membrane trafficking in specialized cells. However, the physiological significance of the presence of multiple Rab effectors and their Rab recognition mechanisms are poorly understood. Rab35 is one such Rab protein and has been shown to bind various candidate effector molecules, including MICAL-1 (7Fukuda M. Kanno E. Ishibashi K. Itoh T.

Pathways and mechanisms of endocytic recycling.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2009; 10: 597-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (1013) Google Scholar). The pleiotropic roles of Rab35 in membrane trafficking may be attributable to the presence of multiple Rab35 effectors, but the involvement of individual Rab35 effectors in the above cellular events has remained largely unknown. Moreover, almost nothing is known about the structural basis of Rab35·effector complexes, e.g. about the critical amino acid residues for the Rab35/effector interactions. Although identification of a specific amino acid(s) in Rab35 that is exclusively involved in interaction with only one effector molecule would enhance our understanding of the molecular mechanism of Rab35-mediated membrane trafficking, no attempts have ever been made to biochemically analyze Rab35/effector interactions. In this study, we focused on centaurin-β2 (also called ACAP2), an Arf6-GAP (26Jackson T.R. Brown F.D. Nie Z. Miura K. Foroni L. Sun J. Hsu V.W. Donaldson J.G. Randazzo P.A. ACAPs are arf6 GTPase-activating proteins that function in the cell periphery.J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 627-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar) that is required for nerve growth factor (NGF)-induced neurite outgrowth of PC12 cells (8Kanno E. Ishibashi K. Kobayashi H.

Cell Sci. 2012; 125: 2235-2243Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), and analyzed the exclusive specificity of the Rab35/centaurin-β2 interaction with Rab35 by performing deletion and mutation analyses. The results showed that two Thr residues (Thr-76 and Thr-81) in the switch II region of Rab35 are responsible for binding centaurin-β2 and that they are not responsible for Rab35 binding to other effectors. Knockdown-rescue experiments showed that a centaurin-β2 binding-deficient Rab35 mutant, Rab35(T76S/T81A), did not support NGF-induced neurite outgrowth. Based on our findings, we discuss the utility of the Rab35(T76S/T81A) mutant as a tool to investigate the involvement of the Rab35·centaurin-β2 complex in Rab35-dependent cellular events. Horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated anti-FLAG tag (M2) mouse monoclonal antibody, anti-FLAG tag antibody-conjugated agarose (Sigma-Aldrich), HRP-conjugated anti-T7 tag mouse monoclonal antibody (Merck Biosciences Novagen, Darmstadt, Germany), anti-centaurin-β2 goat polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), anti-GFP rabbit polyclonal antibody (MBL, Nagoya, Japan), and anti-β-actin mouse monoclonal antibody (Applied Biological Materials, Richmond, British Columbia, Canada) were obtained commercially. Anti-Rab35 antibody was prepared as described previously (14Kobayashi H. Fukuda M. Rab35 regulates Arf6 activity through centaurin-β2 (ACAP2) during neurite outgrowth.J. Cell Sci. 2012; 125: 2235-2243Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Mutant mouse Rab35 expression plasmids carrying a Thr-to-Ser and Thr-to-Ala double mutation at amino acid positions 76 and 81, respectively, named Rab35(T76S/T81A); a swapping mutation in the switch II region between Rab35 (amino acids (AA) 70–76) and Rab5A (AA82–88) named Rab35(S5A) (see Fig. 2A for details); or a short hairpin RNA (shRNA)-resistant mutant named Rab35SR were produced by PCR sewing methods essentially as described previously (27Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Site-directed mutagenesis by overlap extension using the polymerase chain reaction.Gene. 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6825) Google Scholar). In brief, PCRs were performed to generate two DNA fragments having overlapping ends into which specific alterations were introduced by using two sets of oligonucleotides, e.g. 5′-CGGATCCATGGCCCGGGACTACGACCA-3′ (Rab35-Met primer; sense) and 5′-ATGGGCCCCCCGATAATAGGAAGA-3′ (Rab35(T76S/T81A)-3′ primer; antisense) and 5′-TCTTCCTATTATCGGGGGGCCCAT-3′ (Rab35(T76S/T81A)-5′ primer; sense) and 5′-TTAGCAGCAGCTTTCTTTCG-3′ (Rab35-stop primer; antisense) (substituted nucleotides are underlined, and stop codons are in bold). After purification of the two DNA fragments, they were combined to generate the fusion product by a second PCR in which the Rab35-Met primer and Rab35-stop primer were used. The resulting Rab35 mutant cDNAs were subcloned into the pEGFP (enhanced green fluorescent protein)-C1 vector (Clontech-Takara Bio Inc., Shiga, Japan), pGBD-C1 vector (28James P. Halladay J.

PC12 cell and COS-7 cell cultures and plasmid transfections were performed essentially as described previously (14Kobayashi H. Fukuda M. Rab35 regulates Arf6 activity through centaurin-β2 (ACAP2) during neurite outgrowth.J. Cell Sci. 2012; 125: 2235-2243Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Plasmids were transfected into cultured cells 1 day after plating by using Lipofectamine LTX or Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen), each according to the manufacturer's instructions. Because the protein expression level of wild-type and mutant Rab35SR (or centaurin-β2SR) differs slightly even when the same amount of plasmid is transfected into PC12 cells, the amounts of plasmid used for transfection were varied to maintain the total amount of recombinant proteins at the same level (see Figs. 3C and 7C). To avoid overexpression in the knockdown-rescue experiments, we tried to maintain the level of the recombinant proteins at levels that were similar to the level of the endogenous protein (see Figs. 3C and 7C). Under our experimental conditions, the transfection efficiency of the EGFP-expressing plasmids into PC12 cells was ∼40–50%.FIGURE 7Effect of the N610A/N691A mutation of centaurin-β2 on NGF-induced neurite outgrowth of PC12 cells.

The cells were fixed after NGF stimulation for 36 h and examined under a confocal microscope. Note that knockdown of centaurin-β2 in PC12 cells inhibited neurite outgrowth (top right panel), whereas re-expression of Centβ2SR(WT) (bottom left panel), but not of Centβ2SR(N610A/N691A) (bottom middle panel) or Centβ2SR(ΔANKR) (bottom right panel), in shCentβ2-treated PC12 cells restored total neurite length. Under our experimental conditions, manipulation of centaurin-β2 had no significant effect on the number of neurites (shControl, 2.2 ± 0.05; shCentβ2, 2.0 ± 0.04; shCentβ2 + Centβ2SR(WT), 2.1 ± 0.04; shCentβ2 + Centβ2SR(N610A/N691A), 2.0 ± 0.04; and shCentβ2 + Centβ2SR(ΔANKR), 2.0 ± 0.05 (mean ± S.E.)), suggesting that centaurin-β2 is involved in neurite extension rather than in neuritogenesis, the same as Rab35 is.

https://openalex.org/W2041872030,"Purpose To examine the occurrence of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and the unfolded protein response (UPR) following acute light damage in the naturally-occurring canine model of RHO-adRP (T4R RHO dog). Methods The left eyes of T4R RHO dogs were briefly light-exposed and retinas collected 3, 6 and 24 hours later. The contra-lateral eyes were shielded and used as controls. To evaluate the time course of cell death, histology and TUNEL assays were performed. Electron microscopy was used to examine ultrastructural alterations in photoreceptors at 15 min, 1 hour, and 6 hours after light exposure. Gene expression of markers of ER stress and UPR were assessed by RT-PCR, qRT-PCR and western blot at the 6 hour time-point. Calpain and caspase-3 activation were assessed at 1, 3 and 6 hours after exposure. Results A brief exposure to clinically-relevant levels of white light causes within minutes acute disruption of the rod outer segment disc membranes, followed by prominent ultrastructural alterations in the inner segments and the initiation of cell death by 6 hours. Activation of the PERK and IRE1 pathways, and downstream targets (BIP, CHOP) of the UPR was not observed. However increased transcription of caspase-12 and hsp70 occurred, as well as calpain activation, but not that of caspase-3. Conclusion The UPR is not activated in the early phase of light-induced photoreceptor cell death in the T4R RHO model. Instead, disruption in rods of disc and plasma membranes within minutes after light exposure followed by increase in calpain activity and caspase-12 expression suggests a different mechanism of degeneration."
https://openalex.org/W2004757590,"Apert syndrome (AS) is a type of autosomal dominant disease characterized by premature fusion of the cranial sutures, severe syndactyly, and other abnormalities in internal organs. Approximately 70% of AS cases are caused by a single mutation, S252W, in fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 (FGFR2). Two groups have generated FGFR2 knock-in mice Fgfr2S252W/+ that exhibit features of AS. During the present study of AS using the Fgfr2S252W/+ mouse model, an age-related phenotype of bone homeostasis was discovered. The long bone mass was lower in 2 month old mutant mice than in age-matched controls but higher in 5 month old mutant mice. This unusual phenotype suggested that bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs), which are vital to maintain bone homeostasis, might be involved. BMSCs were isolated from Fgfr2S252W/+ mice and found that S252W mutation could impair osteogenic differentiation BMSCs but enhance mineralization of more mature osteoblasts. A microarray analysis revealed that Wnt pathway inhibitors SRFP1/2/4 were up-regulated in mutant BMSCs. This work provides evidence to show that the Wnt/β-catenin pathway is inhibited in both mutant BMSCs and osteoblasts, and differentiation defects of these cells can be ameliorated by Wnt3a treatment. The present study suggested that the bone abnormalities caused by deregulation of Wnt pathway may underlie the symptoms of AS."

https://openalex.org/W2166725161,"Congenital anomalies of the kidney and urogenital tract (CAKUT) occur in approximately 0.5% of live births and represent the most frequent cause of end-stage renal disease in neonates and children. The genetic basis of CAKUT is not well defined. To understand more fully the genetic basis of one type of CAKUT, unilateral renal agenesis (URA), we are studying inbred ACI rats, which spontaneously exhibit URA and associated urogenital anomalies at an incidence of approximately 10%. URA is inherited as an incompletely dominant trait with incomplete penetrance in crosses between ACI and Brown Norway (BN) rats and a single responsible genetic locus, designated Renag1, was previously mapped to rat chromosome 14 (RNO14). The goals of this study were to fine map Renag1, identify the causal genetic variant responsible for URA, confirm that the Renag1 variant is the sole determinant of URA in the ACI rat, and define the embryologic basis of URA in this rat model. Data presented herein localize Renag1 to a 379 kilobase (kb) interval that contains a single protein coding gene, Kit (v-kit Hardy-Zukerman 4 feline sarcoma viral oncogene homolog); identify an endogenous retrovirus-derived long terminal repeat located within Kit intron 1 as the probable causal variant; demonstrate aberrant development of the nephric duct in the anticipated number of ACI rat embryos; and demonstrate expression of Kit and Kit ligand (Kitlg) in the nephric duct. Congenic rats that harbor ACI alleles at Renag1 on the BN genetic background exhibit the same spectrum of urogenital anomalies as ACI rats, indicating that Renag1 is necessary and sufficient to elicit URA and associated urogenital anomalies. These data reveal the first genetic link between Kit and URA and illustrate the value of the ACI rat as a model for defining the mechanisms and cell types in which Kit functions during urogenital development."

T cells are thought to express telomerase to avoid replicative senescence, unlike most normal somatic cells with definite replicative lifespan. T cells in blood and tissues are usually in a state of quiescence without expression of the limiting catalytic subunit of telomerase, human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT). In contrast to activation, repression of hTERT transcription has not been studied well. Our previous studies have found an hTERT promoter element with repressive function. Here we identified KLF2, which represses hTERT transcription by binding to the putative promoter element. KLF2 and hTERT exhibited reciprocal mRNA expression patterns in primary human T cells. In activated T cells, KLF2 binding to the hTERT promoter was eliminated, relieving the repression of hTERT transcription found in resting T cells. Our results suggest that KLF2 is involved in strict repression of hTERT expression through binding to the promoter in primary human T cells.

https://openalex.org/W2033262826,"Toll-like receptors (TLRs) mediate immune recognition of both microbial infections and tissue damage. Aberrant TLR signaling promotes disease; thus, understanding the regulation of TLR signaling is of medical relevance. Although downstream mediators of TLR signaling have been identified, the detailed mechanism by which ligand binding-mediated dimerization induces downstream signaling remains poorly understood. Here, we investigate this question for TLR4, which mediates responsiveness to bacterial LPS and drives inflammatory disease. TLR4 exhibits structural and functional features that are unique among TLRs, including responsiveness to a wide variety of ligands. However, the connection between these structural features and the regulation of signaling is not clear. Here, we investigated how the unique intracellular structures of TLR4 contribute to receptor signaling. Key conclusions include the following. 1) The unique intracellular linker of TLR4 is important for achieving LPS-inducible signaling via Toll/IL-1 receptor (TIR) domain-containing adapter-inducing interferon-β (TRIF) but less so for signaling via myeloid differentiation primary response 88 (MyD88). 2) Membrane-bound TLR4 TIR domains were sufficient to induce signaling. However, introducing long, flexible intracellular linkers neither induced constitutive signaling nor ablated LPS-inducible signaling. Thus, the initiation of TLR4 signaling is regulated by a mechanism that does not require tight geometric constraints. Together, these observations necessitate refining the model of TLR4 signal initiation. We hypothesize that TLR4 may interact with an inhibitory partner in the absence of ligand, via both TIR and extracellular domains of TLR4. In this speculative model, ligand binding induces dissociation of the inhibitory partner, triggering spontaneous, switchlike TIR domain homodimerization to initiate downstream signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2035051943,"Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD) is an autosomal-dominant disease with no effective treatment. The genetic cause of FSHD is complex and the primary pathogenic insult underlying the muscle disease is unknown. Several disease candidate genes have been proposed including DUX4 and FRG1. Expression analysis studies of FSHD report the deregulation of genes which mediate myoblast differentiation and fusion. Transgenic mice overexpressing FRG1 recapitulate the FSHD muscular dystrophy phenotype. Our current study selectively examines how increased expression of FRG1 may contribute to myoblast differentiation defects. We generated stable C2C12 cell lines overexpressing FRG1, which exhibited a myoblast fusion defect upon differentiation. To determine if myoblast fusion defects contribute to the FRG1 mouse dystrophic phenotype, this strain was crossed with skeletal muscle specific FHL1-transgenic mice. We previously reported that FHL1 promotes myoblast fusion in vitro and FHL1-transgenic mice develop skeletal muscle hypertrophy. In the current study, FRG1 mice overexpressing FHL1 showed an improvement in the dystrophic phenotype, including a reduced spinal kyphosis, increased muscle mass and myofiber size, and decreased muscle fibrosis. FHL1 expression in FRG1 mice, did not alter satellite cell number or activation, but enhanced myoblast fusion. Primary myoblasts isolated from FRG1 mice showed a myoblast fusion defect that was rescued by FHL1 expression. Therefore, increased FRG1 expression may contribute to a muscular dystrophy phenotype resembling FSHD by impairing myoblast fusion, a defect that can be rescued by enhanced myoblast fusion via expression of FHL1."
https://openalex.org/W2135607233,"While empathy is typically assumed to promote effective social interactions, it can sometimes be detrimental when it is unrestrained and overgeneralized. The present study explored whether cognitive inhibition would moderate the effect of empathy on social functioning. Eighty healthy young adults underwent two assessments six months apart. Participants’ ability to suppress interference from distracting emotional stimuli was assessed using a Negative Affective Priming Task that included both generic and personally-relevant (i.e., participants’ intimate partners) facial expressions of emotion. The UCLA Life Stress Interview and Empathy Quotient were administered to measure interpersonal functioning and empathy respectively. Multilevel modeling demonstrated that higher empathy was associated with worse concurrent interpersonal outcomes for individuals who showed weak inhibition of the personally-relevant depictions of anger. The effect of empathy on social functioning might be dependent on individuals’ ability to suppress interference from meaningful emotional distractors in their environment."
https://openalex.org/W2318668917,"Protein tyrosine phosphatase α (PTPα) promotes integrin-stimulated cell migration in part through the role of Src-phosphorylated PTPα-Tyr(P)-789 in recruiting and localizing p130Cas to focal adhesions. The growth factor IGF-1 also stimulates PTPα-Tyr-789 phosphorylation to positively regulate cell movement. This is in contrast to integrin-induced PTPα phosphorylation, that induced by IGF-1 can occur in cells lacking Src family kinases (SFKs), indicating that an unknown kinase distinct from SFKs can target PTPα. We show that this IGF-1-stimulated tyrosine kinase is Abl. We found that PTPα binds to the scaffold protein RACK1 and that RACK1 coordinates the IGF-1 receptor, PTPα, and Abl in a complex to enable IGF-1-stimulated and Abl-dependent PTPα-Tyr-789 phosphorylation. In cells expressing SFKs, IGF-1-stimulated phosphorylation of PTPα is mediated by RACK1 but is Abl-independent. Furthermore, expressing the SFKs Src and Fyn in SFK-deficient cells switches IGF-1-induced PTPα phosphorylation to occur in an Abl-independent manner, suggesting that SFK activity dominantly regulates IGF-1/IGF-1 receptor signaling to PTPα. RACK1 is a molecular scaffold that integrates growth factor and integrin signaling, and our identification of PTPα as a RACK1 binding protein suggests that RACK1 may coordinate PTPα-Tyr-789 phosphorylation in these signaling networks to promote cell migration."
https://openalex.org/W1984951047,"Homocysteine level can lead to adverse effects on the brain white matter through endothelial dysfunction, microstructural inflammation, and neurotoxin effects. Despite previously observed associations between elevated homocysteine and macroscopic structural brain changes, it is still unknown whether microstructural associations of homocysteine on brain tissue properties can be observed in healthy subjects with routine MRI. To this end, we investigated potential relationships between homocysteine levels and microstructural measures computed with diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) in a cohort of 338 healthy participants. Significant positive correlations were observed between homocysteine levels and diffusivity measures in the bilateral temporal WM, the brainstem, and the bilateral cerebellar peduncle. This is the first study demonstrating that DTI is sufficiently sensitive to relate microstructural WM properties to homocysteine levels in healthy subjects."
https://openalex.org/W2016024198,"Introduction Molecular markers for predicting prostate cancer (PCa) that would have poor prognosis are urgently needed for a more personalized treatment for patients. Regulated intramembrane proteolysis of Epithelial cell adhesion molecule results in shedding of the extracellular domain (EpEx) and release of its intracellular domain (Ep-ICD) which triggers oncogenic signaling and might correlate to tumor aggressiveness. This study aimed to explore the potential of Ep-ICD and EpEx to identify PCa that have poor prognosis. Methods Immunohistochemical analysis of Ep-ICD and EpEx was carried out in normal prostate tissues (n = 100), benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH, n = 83), and prostate cancer (n = 249) using domain specific antibodies. The expression of Ep-ICD and EpEx was correlated with clinico- pathological parameters and disease free survival (DFS). Results Reduced expression of nuclear Ep-ICD and membrane EpEx was observed in PCa in comparison with BPH and normal prostate tissues (p = 0.006, p < 0.001 respectively). For patients who had PCa with Gleason Score less than 7, preserved nuclear Ep-ICD emerged as the most significant marker in multivariate analysis for prolonged DFS, where these patients did not have recurrence during follow up of up to 12 years (p = 0.001). Conclusion Reduced expression of nuclear Ep-ICD was associated with shorter disease free survival in patients with a Gleason Score less than 7 and may be useful in identifying patients likely to have aggressive tumors with poor prognosis. Furthermore, nuclear Ep-ICD can differentiate between normal and prostate cancer tissues for ambiguous cases."
