https://openalex.org/W1972239225,"The FKHR gene was first identified from its disruption by the t(2;13) chromosomal translocation seen in the pediatric tumor alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma. It encodes for a member of the forkhead family of transcription factors. Recently, a homolog of FKHR in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans was identified called DAF-16, which is a downstream target of two Akt homologs in an insulin-related signaling pathway. We have examined the possible role of Akt in the regulation of FKHR. We find that FKHR can bind in vitro to the insulin-responsive sequence (IRS) in the insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 1 promoter and can activate transcription from a reporter plasmid containing multiple copies of the IRS. Expression of active but not inactive Akt can suppress FKHR-mediated transcriptional activation. Akt can phosphorylate FKHR in vitro on three phosphoacceptor sites, at least a subset of which can also be phosphorylated by Akt in vivo. Importantly, mutation of these three sites to alanine residues enhances the transcriptional activity of FKHR and renders it resistant to inhibition by Akt. Expression of an Akt-resistant mutant of FKHR causes apoptosis in 293T cells in a manner dependent on DNA binding. These results suggest that FKHR may be a direct nuclear regulatory target for Akt in both metabolic and cell survival pathways.

Transcription factors may be potential nuclear substrates for Akt, which is known to mediate some of insulin's effects on hepatic gene transcription (1Coffer P.J. Jin J. Woodgett J.R. Biochem.

The FKHR gene was first identified by virtue of its fusion to the PAX3 gene in the t(2;13) translocation found in the pediatric soft tissue tumor alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma (11Galili N. Davis R.J.

This gene encodes for a protein containing a DNA-binding motif shared with members of the HNF-3/forkhead family of transcription factors (12Clevidence D.E. Overdier D.G. Tao W. Qian X. Pani L. Lai E.

Recently, the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans forkhead transcription factor DAF-16 was identified as a potential homolog of FKHR (15Lin K. Dorman J.B. Rodan A. Kenyon C.

Nature. 1997; 389: 994-999Crossref PubMed Scopus (1517) Google Scholar). Genetic data in C. elegans suggest that DAF-16 is a downstream target of two Akt homologs in an insulin-related signaling pathway (17Paradis S. Ruvkun G. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2488-2498Crossref PubMed Scopus (547) Google Scholar). We have investigated whether FKHR may be a direct downstream regulatory target of Akt in mammalian cells. Our data identify FKHR as a positive transcription regulator that can bindin vitro to the IGFBP-1 insulin-responsive sequence (IRS) and also induce apoptosis. We have identified three Akt phosphorylation sites in FKHR and have data suggesting that phosphorylation on all or a subset of these sites contributes to the down-regulation of FKHR's ability to activate transcription and to induce apoptosis. Because its activity can be inhibited by Akt phosphorylation, FKHR is a potential Akt nuclear target in metabolic and survival pathways. Two oligonucleotides (GCAAAACAAACTTATTTTGAAGCAAAACAAACTTATTTTGAAGCAAAACAAACTTATTTTGAA and TCGATTCAAAATAAGTTTGTTTTGCTTCAAAATAAGTTTGTTTTGCTTCAAAATAAGTTTGTTTTGCGTAC) were annealed together and ligating into the KpnI andXbaI sites of pGL2-Promoter (Promega) to create 3×IRS-luc. A cDNA construct containing the full-length open reading frame of wild-type FKHR (11Galili N. Davis R.J. Fredericks W.J. Mukhopadhyay S. Rauscher III, F.J. Emanuel B.S. Rovera G. Barr F.G. Nat. Genet. 1993; 5: 230-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (765) Google Scholar) was assembled into the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3 (Invitrogen). An expression vector for FLAG-tagged FKHR was created by ligating a KpnI/XbaI cDNA fragment from pcDNA3-FKHR into pcDNA3-FLAG. 2E. D. Tang and K.-L. Guan, unpublished data. pcDNA3 expression plasmids for FLAG-tagged FKHR H215R, FKHR T24A, FKHR S256A, FKHR S319A, FKHR(AAA), and FKHR(AAA) H215R were constructed by polymerase chain reaction mutagenesis and verified by sequencing. GST expression vectors for FKHR-N and FKHR-C were constructed by ligatingNcoI and EcoRI-cut fragments, respectively, from pcDNA3- FKHR into pGEX-KG (18Guan K.L. Dixon J.E. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 192: 262-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (1635) Google Scholar). FKHR-N and FKHR-C are predicted to include residues 1–257 and 211–416 (11Galili N. Davis R.J. Fredericks W.J. Mukhopadhyay S. Rauscher III, F.J. Emanuel B.S. Rovera G. Barr F.G. Nat. Genet. 1993; 5: 230-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (765) Google Scholar), respectively. FKHR-N T24A, FKHR-C S256A, FKHR-C S319A, and FKHR-C(AA) were subcloned into pGEX-KG by ligation of the appropriate NcoI or EcoRI-cut fragments cut from pcDNA3 constructs. The expression and purification of GST fusion proteins was performed using DH5α bacteria as described previously (18Guan K.L. Dixon J.E. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 192: 262-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (1635) Google Scholar). 293 cells grown in 12-well plates were transfected using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) with 0.1 μg of pcDNA3 or FKHR expression plasmid, 0.1 μg of luciferase reporter, and 10 ng of pCMV-β-gal. Bluescript (Strategene) was included in all samples to adjust the total DNA transfected to 0.8 μg. Luciferase assays were performed as described previously (19Ausubel F.M. Roger B. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Smith J.A. Seidman J.G. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, New York1987Google Scholar). Binding reactions contained binding buffer (50 mmTris (pH 7.5), 13 mm MgCl2, 1 mmEDTA, 5% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol), 0.5 μg of poly(dI-dC), 0.5 μg of poly(dA-dT), 0.5 ng of 32P-labeled oligonucleotide probe, and purified GST fusion protein (50 ng) or cellular lysate (2 μg). After 10-min incubation at 22 °C, reaction products were separated on a 4% polyacrylamide gel containing 0.5 × Tris borate-EDTA. 293 cells transfected with HA-tagged myr-Akt or Akt K179M plasmid were lysed and whole cell extracts prepared by resuspending in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.1% Triton X-100, 1 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaF, 10 mm sodium β-glycerol phosphate, 5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm Na3VO4, 0.1% 2-mercaptoethanol). Clarified extracts were incubated with anti-HA monoclonal antibody (Babco), and immunoprecipitates were incubated with 6.6 mm MOPS (pH 7.2), 8.3 mm β-glycerol phosphate (pH 7.0), 0.33 mm Na3VO4, 0.33 mm dithiothreitol, 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, 25 mm MgCl2, 166 μm ATP, and 50 ng of GST fusion protein at 30 °C for 30 min. 293T cells were transfected with 0.1 μg of pCMV-β-gal, 0.5 μg of Bluescript (Strategene), and 0.5 μg of pcDNA3 or FLAG-tagged FKHR expression vector. 24 h after transfection, at least 300 transfected cells per sample were analyzed for apoptosis as described previously (20Miura M. Zhu H. Rotello R. Hartwieg E.A. Yuan J. Cell. 1993; 75: 653-660Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1325) Google Scholar). 293T cells grown on 10-cm plates were transfected with 4 μg of Bluescript and 4 μg of pcDNA3 or FLAG-tagged FKHR expression plasmid. 48 h after transfection, cells were lysed and DNA precipitated as described previously (21Yenush L. Zanella C. Uchida T. Bernal D. White M.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6784-6794Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The IRS in the IGFBP-1 promoter has been shown previously to be bound specifically in vitro by HNF-3, a forkhead family member (22Unterman T.G. Fareeduddin A. Harris M.A. Goswami R.G. Porcella A. Costa R.H. Lacson R.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 203: 1835-1841Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 23O'Brien R.M. Noisin E.L. Suwanichkul A. Yamasaki T. Lucas P.C. Wang J.-C. Powell D.R. Granner D.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1747-1758Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We performed in vitro DNA binding assays to determine whether FKHR might be able to recognize the IGFBP-1 IRS also. In EMSAs, we found that when expressed as a glutathioneS-transferase (GST) fusion protein, an N-terminal fragment of FKHR containing the forkhead DNA-binding motif could bind to a probe containing the IGFBP-1 IRS (Fig.1 A). In contrast, probes containing either of two mutant versions of the IRS (Fig.1 A) were not bound by FKHR. Significantly, these two IRS mutations have been shown to eliminate the response of the IGFBP-1 promoter to insulin in transient transfection assays (23O'Brien R.M. Noisin E.L. Suwanichkul A. Yamasaki T. Lucas P.C. Wang J.-C. Powell D.R. Granner D.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1747-1758Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We found that mutation of histidine 215 in FKHR to arginine (H215R) signficantly reduced DNA binding activity (Fig. 1 A). This histidine residue is conserved in all forkhead family members and is involved in making contacts with DNA (24Clark K.L. Halay E.D. Lai E. Burley S.K. Nature. 1993; 364: 412-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (1077) Google Scholar). In order to examine whether recombinant full-length FKHR expressed in mammalian cells could also bind to the IGFBP-1 IRS, we performed EMSA with radiolabeled IGFBP-1 IRS probe using extracts from transfected 293 cells. Extracts from cells transfected with FLAG-FKHR were found to contain a novel supershifted complex not found when using control extracts (Fig. 1 B). Inclusion of a FLAG antibody but not an unrelated antibody in the reactions significantly disrupted this complex, indicating that it contained FLAG-FKHR. This complex bound to the IRS specifically because it was not seen when either of the two mutant probes was used (data not shown). Consistent with a critical role of histidine 215 for DNA binding, lysates from cell transfected with FLAG-FKHR H215R contained no detectable binding activity for the IRS probe (Fig.1 B). Next, we wished to test whether FKHR might be able to activate transcription through the IGFBP-1 IRS. A C-terminal region of FKHR has been found previously to activate transcription when fused to a heterologous DNA-binding domain (25Bennicelli J.L. Fredericks W.J. Wilson R.B. Rauscher III, F.J. Barr F.G. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 119-130PubMed Google Scholar, 26Sublett J.E. Jeon I.S. Shapiro D.N. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 545-552PubMed Google Scholar). We constructed a luciferase reporter construct (3×IRS-luc), which contained three tandem copies of the IGFBP-1 IRS placed upstream of a basal promoter and the firefly luciferase gene. Transfection of epitope-tagged FKHR in 293 cells resulted in transcriptional enhancement in a dose-dependent manner with 3×IRS-luc, whereas no enhancement was observed with a reporter plasmid lacking IRS elements (Fig. 1 C). In contrast, FKHR H215R was unable to elicit any significant activation of 3×IRS-luc. The H215R mutation, however, did not impair the ability of FKHR to transactivate when fused to the yeast GAL4 DNA-binding domain (data not shown). Collectively, these results suggest that FKHR can activate transcription directly through the IRS from the IGFBP-1 promoter. Since expression of active Akt is known to be sufficient to mimic insulin's inhibitory effects on transcription through the IGFBP-1 IRS (27Cichy S.B. Uddin S. Danilkovich A. Guo S. Klippel A. Unterman T.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6482-6487Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), we tested whether FKHR might be able to be negatively regulated by Akt. Cotransfection of plasmid for wild-type, but not kinase-dead Akt, containing a point mutation in its catalytic domain (K179M), resulted in a significant repression of FKHR-mediated transcriptional activation (Fig. 2). A constitutively active mutant of Akt containing a myristoylated amino terminus (myr-Akt) was also a potent inhibitor (data not shown). Thus, Akt can suppress transcriptional activation by FKHR, and this effect requires the catalytic activity of Akt. The amino acid sequence of FKHR contains three putative consensus Akt phosphorylation sites (Thr24, Ser256, and Ser319) (Fig. 3 A), all of which are conserved in the C. elegans DAF-16 transcription factor (17Paradis S. Ruvkun G. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2488-2498Crossref PubMed Scopus (547) Google Scholar). In order to test whether any of these sites might be phosphorylated in vitro by Akt, we performed kinase assays using immunoprecipitated HA-tagged myr-Akt or Akt K179m from cell lysates. Because of difficulties we had in expressing full-length FKHR in bacteria, we expressed and purified two smaller fragments of FKHR as GST fusion proteins to test as potential substrates. One fragment included Thr24 (FKHR-N) and the other contained Ser256 and Ser319 (FKHR-C). Both GST-FKHR-N and GST-FKHR-C were phosphorylated by immunoprecipitated myr-Akt but not inactive Akt (Fig. 3 A). In contrast, no phosphorylation was seen when GST was used as a substrate (Fig. 3 A). Next, versions of each FKHR protein containing alanine substitutions at phosphoacceptor sites were compared as substrates for myr-Akt. Mutation of Thr24 in GST-FKHR-N was found to prevent its phosphorylation (Fig. 3 B,top). Also, mutation of Ser256 and Ser319 each individually led to a partial reduction in phosphorylation of GST-FKHR-C, while mutation of both eliminated any detectable phosphorylation (Fig. 3 B, bottom). These results support the notion that Thr24, Ser256, and Ser319 all can serve as Akt phosphorylation sites in vitro. We observed FKHR expression by Western blot using lysates prepared from cells transfected with FLAG-FKHR and either wild-type Akt or kinase-dead Akt. FLAG-tagged FKHR migrated as multiple immunoreactive bands by SDS-PAGE in the presence of serum (Fig. 3 C,top). Cotransfection of wild-type, but not kinase-dead, Akt altered the migration of these bands. The fastest migrating band disappeared whereas new slower migrating bands appeared. We observed a reproducible increase in FKHR protein levels when wild-type Akt was expressed, which may be due to a stabilizing effect of phosphorylation. In order to determine whether the slower migrating bands might represent phosphorylated forms, we treated immunoprecipitated FLAG-tagged FKHR from the same lysates coexpressing wild-type Akt with λ phosphatase. Phosphatase treatment resulted in a collapse of the bands into a faster migrating band. (Fig. 3 C,middle). Inclusion of the phosphatase inhibitors vanadate and NaF prevented this collapse (data not shown). Thus, the alterations in migrating bands caused by Akt expression are due to phosphorylation. Next, we compared the effect of wild-type Akt on the migration of FLAG-tagged wild-type FKHR and FKHR(AAA). FKHR(AAA) migrated as a single band, which comigrated with the fastest migrating band for wild-type FKHR, suggesting that Thr24, Ser256, and/or Ser319 might be phosphorylated by endogenous kinases (Fig. 3 C, bottom). Whereas wild-type Akt caused a shift in migration of bands for wild-type FKHR, the single band seen for FKHR(AAA) remained unchanged. Thus, overexpression of Akt can alter the phosphorylation state of FKHR in vivo, and this can be visualized as a mobility shift by SDS-PAGE. Also, the intactness of all or a subset of the three in vitro phosphorylation sites is important for this mobility shift and phosphorylation. These data support the idea that Akt can phosphorylate FKHR on at least a subset of the in vitro phosphorylation sites (Thr24, Ser256, and Ser319) in vivo. Next, we examined whether the three Akt phosphorylation sites were important for FKHR activity in vivo. We found that proteins containing alanine substitutions at the three phosphoacceptor sites singly (T24A, S256A, and S319A) or together (AAA) possessed greater activity than wild-type protein (Fig. 3 D). Thus, phosphorylation on each of these three sites may contribute to the inhibition of transcriptional activation by FKHR. When myr-Akt was coexpressed, we found that single mutations of each of the three potential Akt phosphorylation sites resulted in partial resistance to Akt inhibition, while mutation of all three sites together produced a mutant form of FKHR that was relatively insensitive to inhibition (Fig.3 D). These data support a model whereby phosphorylation on Thr24, Ser256, and Ser319 each contributes to the inhibitory effects of Akt. In addition to its roles in glucose transport and metabolism, Akt is a critical mediator of cell survival signals elicited by serum and growth factors including insulin. Since Akt serves as an inhibitor of apoptosis, and FKHR is negatively regulated by Akt, we tested whether FKHR might have proapoptotic activity. We transfected 293T cells with wild-type FKHR or FKHR(AAA) and examined transfected cells 48 h later for apoptotic morphology. Transfection of FKHR(AAA) induced features of apoptosis as identified by rounded cells and membrane blebbing (Fig. 4 A). FKHR(AAA)-transfected cells also displayed chromatin condensation and nuclear fragmentation, which are also typical features of apoptotic cells (data not shown). Furthermore, FKHR(AAA) caused DNA fragmentation and activated caspase-3 as assessed in a substrate cleavage assay (Fig.4 A, data not shown). In contrast, wild-type FKHR caused only a slight but reproducible level of apoptosis in morphological assays and caused relatively insignificant levels of DNA fragmentation, despite having higher levels of expression than FKHR(AAA) (Fig.4 A). Since the apoptotic activities of wild-type FKHR and FKHR(AAA) correlate with their relative abilities to activate transcription (Fig. 3 D), apoptosis induced by FKHR may involve its ability to activate gene transcription. Consistent with this idea, introduction of an H215R mutation, which disrupts DNA binding (Fig. 1 A), in FKHR(AAA) significantly reduced its ability to induce apoptosis as assessed by both morphology and DNA fragmentation (Fig. 4 B). As expected, this mutation resulted in a protein that was impaired in its ability to activate transcription from the 3×IRS-luc reporter (data not shown). Thus, the induction of apoptosis by FKHR(AAA) is likely to be dependent, at least in part, on its ability to function as a transcription factor. We postulate that the residual apoptotic activity seen with this mutant protein may be due to residual DNA binding activity and/or synergistic interactions with endogenous forkhead proteins. Our data suggest that FKHR is a direct target of the protein kinase Akt. The C. elegans AKT/DAF-16 pathway is regulated by an insulin-like receptor and is thought to be involved in reproductive metabolism, dauer state entry, and longevity (15Lin K. Dorman J.B. Rodan A. Kenyon C. Science. 1997; 278: 1319-1322Crossref PubMed Scopus (1187) Google Scholar, 16Ogg S. Paradis S. Gottlieb S. Patterson G.I. Lee L. Tissenbaum H.A. Ruvkun G. Nature. 1997; 389: 994-999Crossref PubMed Scopus (1517) Google Scholar). Given our biochemical data suggesting a role for Akt in the direct phosphorylation and inhibition of FKHR, a similar relationship between AKT-1/2 and DAF-16 would be predicted to exist. Because of its abilities to bind in vitro to the IGFBP-1 IRS and activate transcription from a reporter containing multiple IRSs, FKHR is a candidate mediator of IGFBP-1 expression. Further experiments are necessary to determine whether endogenous FKHR may be an important target of insulin in regulating hepatic IGFBP-1 gene transcription. We also find that FKHR possesses proapoptotic activity, especially when it exists in the more active “dephosphorylated” state. The ability of FKHR to induce apoptosis appears to depend on its transcriptional activity. It will be of considerable interest to determine whether endogenous FKHR may be involved in promoting apoptosis in response to known apoptotic stimuli. If so, FKHR may represent an important regulatory target for anti-apoptotic signals that utilize Akt. While this manuscript was in preparation, it was reported that another member of the forkhead family, which is related to FKHR, is also negatively regulated by Akt (28Brunet A. Bonni A. Zigmond M.J.

It will be of interest to determine whether FKHR and other related family members may possess redundant or nonredundant roles in vivo. We are grateful to T. Brtva and A.

Here we show that FKHR, a human homologue of the DAF16 transcription factor in Caenorhabditis elegans, is rapidly phosphorylated by human protein kinase Bα (PKBα) at Thr-24, Ser-256, and Ser-319in vitro and at a much faster rate than BAD, which is thought to be a physiological substrate for PKB. The same three sites, which all lie in the canonical PKB consensus sequences (Arg-Xaa-Arg-Xaa-Xaa-(Ser/Thr)), became phosphorylated when FKHR was cotransfected with either PKB or PDK1 (an upstream activator of PKB). All three residues became phosphorylated when 293 cells were stimulated with insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1). The IGF-1-induced phosphorylation was abolished by the PtdIns 3-kinase inhibitor wortmannin but not by PD 98059 (an inhibitor of the mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade) or by rapamycin. These results indicate that FKHR is a physiological substrate of PKB and that it may mediate some of the physiological effects of PKB on gene expression. DAF16 is known to be a component of a signaling pathway that has been partially dissected genetically and includes homologues of the insulin/IGF-1 receptor, PtdIns 3-kinase and PKB. The conservation of Thr-24, Ser-256, and Ser-319 and the sequences surrounding them in DAF16 therefore suggests that DAF16 is also a direct substrate for PKB in C. elegans.

The conservation of Thr-24, Ser-256, and Ser-319 and the sequences surrounding them in DAF16 therefore suggests that DAF16 is also a direct substrate for PKB in C. elegans. In recent years evidence has accumulated that many of the metabolic actions of insulin may be mediated by a protein kinase cascade that lies “downstream” of phosphatidylinositide (PtdIns) 1The abbreviations used are: PtdIns, phosphatidylinositide; PtdIns(3,4,5)P3, phosphatidylinositide 3,4,5-trisphosphate; PtdIns(3,4)P2, phosphatidylinositide 3,4-diphosphate; PKB, protein kinase B; PDK, 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase; IGF-1, insulin-like growth factor 1; IGFBP-1, IGF-binding protein 1; MAP, mitogen-activated protein; MAPKAP-K1, MAP kinase-activated protein kinase 1; PFK2, 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase; GSK3, glycogen synthase kinase 3; mTOR, mammalian target of rapamycin; PEPCK, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase; PKI, specific peptide inhibitor of cAMP-dependent protein kinase; IRS, insulin response sequence; DAF, dauer arrest phenotype; GST, glutathioneS-transferase; EST, expressed sequence tag 3-kinase and the second messengers PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 and PtdIns(3,4)P2 (reviewed in Refs. 1Cohen P.

This enzyme is activated when it becomes phosphorylated at Thr-308 and Ser-473 (3Alessi D.R. Andjelkovic M. Caudwell F.B. Cron P. Morrice N. Cohen P.

Consistent with these observations, the phosphorylation of PKB at Thr-308, induced by either insulin or insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) is prevented by inhibitors of PtdIns 3-kinase (3Alessi D.R. Andjelkovic M. Caudwell F.B. Cron P. Morrice N. Cohen P. Hemmings B.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6541-6551Crossref PubMed Scopus (2530) Google Scholar). PDK2 has not yet been characterized although, like the phosphorylation of Thr-308, the insulin or IGF-1-induced phosphorylation of Ser-473 is prevented by inhibitors of PtdIns 3-kinase (3Alessi D.R.

Opin. Genet. Dev. 1998; 8: 55-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation by PKB activates cardiac PFK2, and this is thought to underlie the insulin-induced stimulation of glycolysis in the heart. Phosphorylation inhibits GSK3 and is thought to contribute to the stimulation of glycogen synthesis and global protein synthesis by insulin (1Cohen P. Alessi D.R. Cross D.A.E. FEBS Lett. 1997; 410: 3-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar, 2Alessi D.R. Cohen P. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1998; 8: 55-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation by PKB activates mTOR, allowing it to catalyze several phosphorylation events that enhance the translation of specific proteins. The overexpression of PKB has also been shown to mimic other metabolic actions of insulin, such as the stimulation of glucose (14Kohn A.D. Summers S.A. Birnbaum M.J. Roth R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31372-31378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1097) Google Scholar) and amino acid transport (15Hajduch E. Alessi D.R. Hemmings B.A. Hundal H. Diabetes. 1998; 47: 1006-1013Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). When cells are stimulated with IGF-1, PKB is initially translocated to the plasma membrane where it becomes activated by PDK1 and PDK2, but it subsequently accumulates in the nucleus (16Andjelkovic M. Alessi D.R. Meier R. Fernandez A. Lamb N.J.C. Frech M. Cron P. Cohen P. Lucocq J.M. Hemming B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31515-31524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (904) Google Scholar). This raises the question of whether PKB mediates some of the effects of insulin on specific gene transcription, and several pieces of evidence would appear to support this contention. For example, the overexpression of constitutively active mutants of PKB mimics the effects of insulin in stimulating the transcription of the obesity gene product leptin (17Barthel A. Kohn A.D. Luo Y.N. Roth R.A. Endocrinology. 1997; 183: 3559-3562Crossref Scopus (31) Google Scholar) and in inhibiting the transcription of IGF-binding protein 1 (IGFBP-1) (18Cichy S.B. Uddin S. Danilkovich A.

The insulin-induced suppression of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (19Sutherland C. Waltner-Law M. Gnudi L. Kahn B. Granner D.K. J. Biol.

Studies with constitutively active and dominant negative forms of PKB have shown that PKB may mediate transcriptional effects of insulin through a conserved insulin response sequence present in a number of genes known to be inhibited by insulin in the liver, such as IGFBP-1 and PEPCK (18Cichy S.B. Uddin S. Danilkovich A. Guo S. Klippel A. Unterman T.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6482-6487Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). This suggests that PKB may indeed play an important role in mediating the effects of insulin on hepatic gene expression The insulin/IGF-1-stimulated PKB cascade has also been identified inCaenorhabditis elegans, where it is known to stimulate metabolism, to inhibit dauer arrest and to shorten the life span of this nematode (reviewed in Ref. 20Wood W.B. Cell. 1998; 95: 147-150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). In this pathway, which has been partially dissected by genetic techniques, the DAF2 gene encodes a homologue of the IGF-1 receptor and lies “upstream” of the AGE1 gene that encodes a PtdIns 3-kinase homologue and the AKT1 and AKT2 genes that encode homologues of PKB. Downstream of PKB is the transcription factor DAF16; mutations inDAF16 return life span to normal that has been lengthened by inactivating mutations in AGE1 or AKT1/2 (21Lin K. Dorman J.B. Rodan A. Kenyon C. Science. 1997; 278: 1319-1322Crossref PubMed Scopus (1214) Google Scholar,22Ogg S. Paradis S. Gottlieb S. Patterson G.I. Lee L. Tissenbaum H.A. Ruvkun G. Nature. 1997; 389: 994-999Crossref PubMed Scopus (1551) Google Scholar). Whether DAF16 is phosphorylated directly by AKT1/AKT2 is unknown, but we noticed that it possesses three consensus sequences for phosphorylation by PKB, all of which are highly conserved in several mammalian DAF16 homologues, namely the “Forkhead” family members FKHR, FKHRL1, and AFX (23Paradis S. Ruvkun G. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2488-2498Crossref PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar). Two of the three sites are conserved in a further DAF16 homologue encoded by the AF6q21 gene (24Hillion J. LeConiat M. Jonveaux P. Berger R. Bernard O.A. Blood. 1997; 90: 3714-3719Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Here we establish that FKHR is phosphorylated at these three sites by PKB in vitro and in cotransfection experiments and that the same sites become phosphorylated in response to IGF-1 in 293 cells via a PtdIns 3-kinase-dependent pathway that is independent of mTOR or the classical MAP kinase cascade. The accompanying paper (25Guo S. Rena G. Cichy S. He X. Cohen P. Unterman T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17184-17192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar) demonstrates that FKHR-stimulated reporter gene expression is dependent on an intact insulin response sequence (IRS) and that transactivation by FKHR is inhibited by insulin via the phosphorylation of Ser-256 (25Guo S. Rena G. Cichy S. He X. Cohen P. Unterman T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17184-17192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar). The conservation of Thr-24, Ser-256, and Ser-319 and the sequences surrounding them in DAF16 suggests that DAF16 is likely to be a direct substrate for PKB in C. elegans. Taken together, these results indicate that PKB regulates the ability of FKHR to stimulate transcription. Tissue culture reagents and IGF-1 were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc.

Transfection of cells was carried out using the calcium chloride precipitation method, using 10 μg of DNA per 10-cm diameter dish. Prior to lysis, cells were serum-starved for 12 h. Cells were lysed in 1 ml ice-cold Buffer A (50 mm Tris acetate (pH 7.5), 1 mm EGTA, 1% (w/v) Triton X-100, 1 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaF, 10 mm sodium β-glycerophosphate, 5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm benzamidine, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.1% (v/v) β-mercaptoethanol). The lysates were centrifuged at 13,000 × g, and the supernatants were removed, frozen immediately in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C until use. Inspection of the public EST data bases identified 41 clones from 14 different tissues that encoded fragments of FKHR. Inspection of these sequences showed 100% identity with the nucleotide sequence of the second FKHR sequence to be reported (GenBankTMaccession number AF032885 (26Anderson M.J. Viars C.S. Czekay S. Cavenee W.K. Arden K.C. Genomics. 1998; 47: 187-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar)). An epitope-tagged, full-length human FKHR construct was generated as follows. A fusion was generated in which the oligonucleotide 5′-GCGGG GATCC CGCCA CCATG GAGTT CATGC CCATG GAGCT GGTGC TGCCA T-3′ encoding the epitope Glu-Phe-Met-Pro-Met-Glu (termed EE-tag) preceded the first 300 base pairs of FKHR (EST 1061191). This 350-base pair oligonucleotide produced the EE-FKHR fusion in a PCR reaction with a second oligonucleotide: 5′-GGCCG CGGCG GCCGC CGCCG CCACC GCCGC CGCCA CGGAG CC-3′ corresponding to bases 259–300 of the FKHR coding sequence. This PCR product was cloned into the TA cloning vector pCR2.1 TOPO. The remaining 1665 base pairs of FKHR (EST 166558) were incorporated into pCR2.1 by a non-PCR TA cloning method using the NotI and BspMI restriction sites (27Rena G. Houslay M.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 3867-3868Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). A vector containing a construct of full-length FKHR was then generated by ligating the two halves of FKHR in pCR2.1. This construct was then subcloned into pCMV-5 and pEBG2T to allow expression of recombinant FKHR in mammalian cells. Finally, the FKHR construct was subcloned into a pGEX4T-3 vector for expression of a GST-FKHR fusion protein in E. coli. Expressed GST-FKHR was purified by glutathione-Sepharose affinity chromatography and stored at −80 °C in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5 (20 °C), 0.2 mmglutathione at a concentration of 2 mg/ml (4Alessi D.R.

Phosphopeptides and dephosphopeptides were synthesized corresponding to residues 19–31 (RPRSCTpWPLPRPE), 248–262 (KSPRRRAASpMDNNSK), and 311–324 (TTFRPRSSSpNASVS) of FKHR, where p indicates the site of phosphorylation (Thr-24, Ser-256, and Ser-319). The peptides were conjugated to both keyhole limpet hemocyanin and bovine serum albumin and injected into sheep at the Scottish Antibody Production Unit (Carluke, UK). Six weeks later, antisera were passed through a CH-Sepharose column to which a dephosphopeptide had been coupled, followed by affinity chromatography on CH-Sepharose to which the corresponding phosphopeptide antigen had been attached covalently. Phospho-specific antibodies were eluted with 0.1 m glycine, pH 2.4, immediately adjusted to pH 8 with Tris base and stored at 4 °C. A further antibody was generated toward residues 636–651 of FKHR (LPNQSFPHSVKTTTHS) that recognizes the dephosphorylated as well as the phosphorylated form of the protein. PKBα (0.15–5.0 units/ml) that had been expressed in Sf9 cells and activated by phosphorylation with PDK1 (4Alessi D.R. James S.R. Downes C.P. Holmes A.B. Gaffney P.R.J. Reese C.B. Cohen P. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 261-269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was incubated for 30 min at 30 °C with FKHR (0.1 mg/ml) or BAD (0.05 mg/ml) in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5), 0.1 mm EGTA, 2.5 μm PKI, 10 mm magnesium acetate, 0.1 mm ATP (106 cpm/nmol). One unit of PKB activity was that amount that catalyzed the phosphorylation of 1 nmol of the peptide GRPRTSSFAEG in 1 min (11Cross D.A.E. Alessi D.R. Cohen P. Andjelkovic M. Hemmings B.A. Nature. 1995; 378: 785-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (4397) Google Scholar). To determine the stoichiometry of phosphorylation of FKHR and BAD, aliquots of the reaction were denatured in SDS and subjected to polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. After staining with Coomassie Blue and destaining, the gels were dried and the concentrations of GST-FKHR and GST-BAD were determined by densitometry using a Fujifilm LAS-1000 luminescent image analyzer calibrated with different concentrations of bovine serum albumin run in parallel on the same gel. The molecular masses of GST-FKHR and GST-BAD were taken as 97 kDa and 56 kDa, respectively. The observation that FKHR contains three residues, located at Thr-24, Ser-256, and Ser-319, that lie in consensus sequences for phosphorylation by PKB (see introduction) led us to study the phosphorylation of this protein by PKB in vitro. FKHR was phosphorylated by PKB to a stoichiometry of >1 mol of phosphate/mol of protein (Fig.1 A). The initial rate of phosphorylation was much faster than that of the pro-apoptotic protein BAD (Fig. 1 B), which is thought to be an in vivosubstrate for PKB (29Datta S.R. Dudek H. Tao X. Masters S. Fu H.A. Gotoh Y. Greenberg M.E. Cell. 1997; 91: 231-241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4957) Google Scholar). To identify the sites of phosphorylation, we raised phospho-specific antibodies that only recognize FKHR if it is phosphorylated at Thr-24, Ser-256, or Ser-319. The specificity of these antibodies is demonstrated in Fig. 2. The antibody raised against a phosphopeptide corresponding to the sequence surrounding Thr-24 recognized FKHR only after phosphorylation by PKB, and its recognition of phospho-FKHR was prevented if the antibody was first preincubated with the phosphopeptide used to raise it but not by preincubation with either of the other two phosphopeptides. The specificities of the antibodies raised against phosphopeptides corresponding to the sequences surrounding Ser-256 and Ser-319 were established in an analogous manner (Fig. 2). These results demonstrate that PKB phosphorylates FKHR at Thr-24, Ser-256, and Ser-319. The phosphorylation of all three sites approached a plateau after 5–10 min when high concentrations of PKB were present in the assays (5 units/ml) (Fig. 3 A). However, when the concentration of PKB was reduced to 0.15 unit/ml to measure initial rates of phosphorylation, Ser-256 was found to be phosphorylated more rapidly than the other two sites (Fig. 3 B).Figure 3PKB phosphorylates FKHR at three residues. A, bacterially expressed GST-FKHR was incubated with MgATP and PKB (5 units/ml). At the times indicated, aliquots were denatured in SDS, electrophoresed on 8% polyacrylamide gels, transferred to nitrocellulose, and immunoblotted with the antibodies in Fig. 2. B, same as A, except that the concentration of PKB was reduced to 0.15 units/ml, and after immunoblotting, the membranes were analyzed by densitometry to measure the extent of phosphorylation of each site.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To investigate whether FKHR could be phosphorylated by PKB in a cellular context, we co-transfected into 293 cells DNA encoding FKHR with that encoding a constitutively active PKB and then examined FKHR phosphorylation by immunoblotting with the phospho-specific antibodies. These experiments demonstrated that Thr-24, Ser-256, and Ser-319 were phosphorylated to low levels when FKHR was transfected alone and that phosphorylation of each site increased greatly when FKHR was cotransfected with PKB (Fig.4 A). We also found that FKHR became phosphorylated at all three sites when cotransfected with PDK1 (Fig. 4 B), one of the upstream activators of PKB (reviewed in Refs. 1Cohen P. Alessi D.R. Cross D.A.E. FEBS Lett. 1997; 410: 3-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar and 2Alessi D.R. Cohen P. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1998; 8: 55-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar). In 293 cells PKB is maximally activated (50-fold) 5 min after stimulation with IGF-1 with a half-time for activation of 1 min (3Alessi D.R. Andjelkovic M. Caudwell F.B. Cron P. Morrice N. Cohen P. Hemmings B.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6541-6551Crossref PubMed Scopus (2530) Google Scholar). IGF-1 also stimulated the phosphorylation of FKHR at Thr-24, Ser-256, and Thr-319 (Fig. 5), maximal phosphorylation occurring within 10 min (data not shown). Consistent with the IGF-1-induced phosphorylation of FKHR being mediated by PKB, phosphorylation of Thr-24, Ser-256, and Ser-319 was prevented if the cells were incubated with the PtdIns 3-kinase inhibitor wortmannin (100 nm) prior to stimulation with IGF-1 (Fig. 5). The basal level of phosphorylation was also abolished by wortmannin. Residues 24, 256, and 319 all lie in Arg-Xaa-Arg-Xaa-Xaa-(Ser/Thr) sequences that are not only consensus sequences for phosphorylation by PKB but also for phosphorylation by MAP kinase-activated protein kinase 1 (MAPKAP-K1, also called p90rsk) and p70 S6 kinase (9Alessi D.R.

FEBS Lett. 1995; 375: 289-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). MAPKAP-K1 (which lies immediately downstream of MAP kinase) and p70 S6 kinase (which lies downstream of mTOR) are both activated in response to insulin or IGF-1, and their activation is also inhibited by wortmannin (31Cross D.A.E.

To investigate which of these protein kinases mediates the IGF-1-induced phosphorylation of FKHR in vivo, we therefore carried out additional experiments in which 293 cells were incubated with either rapamycin (which prevents the activation of p70 S6 kinase by inhibiting mTOR (33Thomas G. Hall M.N. Curr. Opin.

Neither of these drugs affected the basal or IGF-1-induced phosphorylation of FKHR at Thr-24, Ser-256, and Ser-332 (Fig. 5) although, at the same concentrations, they prevented the basal and IGF-1-induced phosphorylation of p70 S6 kinase and MAPKAP-K1 (data not shown). In this study we have demonstrated a rapid phosphorylation of FKHR by PKB at Thr-24, Ser-256, and Ser-319. This occurs both in vitro (Figs. 2 and 3) and in cotransfection experiments using either PKB (Fig. 4 A) or PDK1 (Fig. 4 B). PDK1 is an upstream activator of PKB (reviewed in Refs. 1Cohen P. Alessi D.R. Cross D.A.E. FEBS Lett. 1997; 410: 3-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar and 2Alessi D.R. Cohen P. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1998; 8: 55-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar), and the phosphorylation of FKHR when cotransfected with PDK1 is presumably catalyzed by the endogenous PKB that becomes activated by the transfected PDK1. Similar observations were made with GSK3, another physiological substrate of PKB (35Shaw M. Cohen P. Alessi D.R. FEBS Lett. 1997; 416: 307-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). We have also shown that all three sites on FKHR become rapidly phosphorylated when 293 cells are stimulated with IGF-1 (Fig. 5). The IGF-1-induced phosphorylation is prevented by inhibitors of PtdIns 3-kinase but not by inhibitors of the activation of the MAP kinase cascade or p70 S6 kinase. These experiments, together with the in vitro studies and cotransfection experiments, indicate that the IGF-1-induced phosphorylation of FKHR is mediated by PKB or a closely related enzyme. A pathway in C. elegans has been partially dissected by genetic techniques in which DAF16 (an FKHR homologue) is a downstream component of a signaling cascade that includes homologues of the insulin/IGF-1 receptor, PtdIns 3-kinase, and PKB (see introduction). PDK1 has not yet been identified as a component of this pathway, perhaps because its inactivation has other (lethal) consequences stemming from its role in activating additional protein kinases that lie in distinct protein kinase cascades. This may explain why disruption of the two PDK1 homologues in Saccharomyces cerevisiae is also lethal (28Casamayor A. Torrance P.D. Kobayashi T. Thorner J. Alessi D.R. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 186-197Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). We have noticed that, as expected, the genome of C. elegans does indeed encode a PDK1 homologue located on the X chromosome (genomic clone number H33H01). The accompanying paper (25Guo S. Rena G. Cichy S. He X. Cohen P. Unterman T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17184-17192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar) shows that FKHR stimulates the transcription of a reporter gene, that this stimulation is dependent on an intact insulin response sequence (IRS), and that transcription is suppressed by 50% when HepG2 cells are exposed to insulin or transfected with constitutively active PKB. In this system, phosphorylation of Ser-256 appears to be required and sufficient to mediate the action of insulin because its mutation to alanine abolishes the effect, whereas mutation to aspartic acid mimics it. Interestingly Ser-256 is the residue in FKHR that is phosphorylated most rapidly by PKB in vitro (Fig. 3 B). In contrast, mutation of Thr-24 or Ser-319 to alanine has no effect on the ability of insulin or constitutively active PKB to disrupt activation by FKHR, and the functional consequences of these other phosphorylation events remain to be determined. Nevertheless, the conservation of the sequences that surround Thr-24 and Ser-319 in two other mammalian FKHR homologues (23Paradis S. Ruvkun G. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2488-2498Crossref PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar) as well as DAF16 of C. elegans (21Lin K. Dorman J.B. Rodan A. Kenyon C. Science. 1997; 278: 1319-1322Crossref PubMed Scopus (1214) Google Scholar, 22Ogg S. Paradis S. Gottlieb S. Patterson G.I. Lee L. Tissenbaum H.A. Ruvkun G. Nature. 1997; 389: 994-999Crossref PubMed Scopus (1551) Google Scholar) suggests that their phosphorylation is likely to play a role(s) in vivo. In conclusion this study, together with that presented in the accompanying paper (25Guo S. Rena G. Cichy S. He X. Cohen P. Unterman T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17184-17192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar), provides the first direct biochemical evidence that the kinase cascade leading to the regulation of DAF16 is present in mammalian cells. The finding that phosphorylation of FKHR inhibits its ability to stimulate transcription is consistent with genetic evidence in C. elegans that has shown that mutations in theDAF16 gene have the opposite phenotype to mutations in either the AGE1 (PtdIns 3-kinase) or AKT1/2 (PKB) genes (21Lin K. Dorman J.B. Rodan A. Kenyon C. Science. 1997; 278: 1319-1322Crossref PubMed Scopus (1214) Google Scholar, 22Ogg S. Paradis S. Gottlieb S. Patterson G.I. Lee L. Tissenbaum H.A. Ruvkun G.

These findings raise the possibility that phosphorylation of FKHR (or its homologues) underlies the regulation of at least some of the genes whose transcription is inhibited by insulin.

These findings occur in the setting of small numbers of productively infected cells within the brain. We determined whether exposure of susceptible cells to Tat protein of HIV could result in the production of select proinflammatory cytokines. In a dose-responsive manner, Tat induced interleukin (IL)-1β production in monocytic cells, while astrocytic cells showed an increase in mRNA for IL-1β, but had a translation block for IL-1β protein production. Conversely, IL-6 protein and mRNA productions were strongly induced in astrocytic cells and minimally in monocytic cells. IL-1β and IL-6 production were independent of tumor necrosis factor-α production. An exposure to Tat for a few minutes was sufficient for sustained releases of cytokines for several hours. This prolonged cytokine production is likely maintained by a positive feed back loop of Tat-induced nuclear factor κB activation and cytokine production that is independent of extracellular calcium. Thus a transient exposure may be sufficient to initiate a cascade of events resulting in cerebral dysfunction and a “hit and run” approach may be in effect. Hence cross-sectional measurement of viral load in the brain may not be a useful indicator of the role of viral products in the neuropathogenesis of HIV dementia.

Several studies have shown that viral proteins such as Tat and gp120 can induce cytokine dysregulation in macrophages and glial cells as well as cause neurotoxicity (1Nath A. Geiger J.D. Prog. Neurobiol. 1998; 54: 19-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). However, it remains uncertain as to why infection of the brain is limited in comparison with the severity of the clinical presentation. In fact, macrophage infiltration, glial cell activation and not viral load in the brain seem to correlate best with the severity of dementia (2Glass J.D. Wesselingh S.L. Selnes O.A. McArthur J.C. Neurology. 1993; 43: 2230-2237Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Johnson R.T. Glass J.D. McArthur J.C. Chesebro B.W. Ann. Neurol. 1996; 39: 392-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). In keeping with these observations cytokine levels in brain and cerebrospinal fluid are elevated in patients with HIV dementia (2Glass J.D. Wesselingh S.L. Selnes O.A. McArthur J.C. Neurology. 1993; 43: 2230-2237Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Merrill J.E. Chen I.S.Y. FASEB J. 1991; 5: 2391-2397Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). The Tat protein of HIV is of particular interest, since it is released extracellularly from unruptured, HIV-infected lymphoid and microglial cells (5Ensoli B. Buonaguro L. Barillari G. Fiorelli V. Gendelman R. Morgan R. Wingfield P. Gallo R. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 277-287Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Tardieu M. Hery C. Peudenier S. Boespflug O. Montagnier L. Ann. Neurol. 1992; 32: 11-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Tat exits from cells via a leaderless secretory pathway in the absence of permeability changes (7Chang H.C. Samaniego F. Nair B.C. Buonaguro L. Ensoli B. AIDS. 1997; 11: 1421-1431Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). This protein thus has the opportunity to interact with other uninfected cells. Further Tat can be detected in mononuclear cells within the brain of patients with HIV encephalitis (8Hofman F.M. Dohadwala M.M. Wright A.D. Hinton D.R. Walker S.M. J. Neuroimmunol. 1994; 54: 19-28Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) and in the sera of HIV-infected individuals (9Westendorp M.O. Frank R. Ochsenbauer C. Stricker K. Dhein J. Walczak H. Debatin K.-M. Krammer P.H. Nature. 1995; 375: 497-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (916) Google Scholar). Tat-mRNA levels are also elevated in the brains of patients with HIV dementia (10Wesselingh S.L. Power C. Glass J.D. Tyor W.R. McArthur J.C. Farber J.M. Griffin J.W. Griffin D.E. Ann. Neurol. 1993; 33: 576-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar, 11Wiley C.A. Baldwin M. Achim C.L. AIDS. 1996; 10: 943-947Crossref Scopus (119) Google Scholar). It has been shown previously that the Tat protein of HIV can induce macrophage infiltration in the brain (12Jones M. Olafson K. Del Bigio M.R. Peeling J. Nath A. J. Neuropathol. Exp. Neurol. 1998; 57: 563-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) likely via production of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 by astrocytes (13Conant K. Garzino-Demo A. Nath A. McArthur J.C. Halliday W. Power C. Gallo R.C. Major E.O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3117-3121Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar). Tat also causes glial cell activation for several days post intracerebroventricular inoculation (12Jones M. Olafson K. Del Bigio M.R. Peeling J. Nath A. J. Neuropathol. Exp. Neurol. 1998; 57: 563-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Furthermore, a Tat-derived peptide when injected into the brain causes cytokine dysregulation (14Philippon V. Vellutini C. Gambarelli D. Harkiss G. Arbuthnott G. Metzger D. Roubin R. Filippi P. Virology. 1994; 205: 519-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) similar to that observed in patients with HIV infection (10Wesselingh S.L. Power C. Glass J.D. Tyor W.R. McArthur J.C. Farber J.M. Griffin J.W. Griffin D.E. Ann. Neurol. 1993; 33: 576-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar, 15Vitkovic L. Geretta W.P. Major E.O. Fauci A.S. AIDS Res. Hum. Retroviruses. 1991; 7: 723-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). In this study, we examine the possibility that a transient exposure of cells to Tat may be sufficient to induce a sustained production of cytokines and we determine the role of extracellular calcium and autoregulation in cytokine production. Peripheral blood monocytes were isolated by a Percoll gradient technique, and human fetal astrocyte cultures were prepared by differential adhesion as described previously (16Furer M. Hartloper V. Wilkins J. Nath A. Cell Adhes. Commun. 1993; 1: 223-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The human astrocytoma cell line U373 and monocytic cell line THP-1 were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD). Human astrocytes and U373 cells were maintained in minimal essential medium with heat-inactivated 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum and 1 mm sodium pyruvate. Monocytes were cultured in RPMI with 10% fetal bovine serum. All cell types were supplemented with 100 μg of streptomycin/ml and 0.25 μg amphotericin/ml. THP-1 cells were cultured in RPMI medium with 10% fetal bovine serum and 5.5 μm β-mercaptoethanol. The cells were cultured to approximately 95% confluence in 24-well plates (≈1 × 105 cells/ml). Highly purified (>95%) recombinant Tat protein was prepared from the tat gene encoding the first 72 amino acids as outlined previously (17Ma M. Nath A. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 2495-2499Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The functional properties of this protein were confirmed using a transactivation assay in HL3T1 cells containing the HIV-1 long terminal repeat, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase construct (17Ma M. Nath A. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 2495-2499Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For experiments designed to determine the effect of a transient exposure to Tat, cells were treated with 100 ng/ml Tat for either 5, 30, or 60 min, following which the cells were washed five times and then reincubated in culture media without Tat protein. In each case, culture supernatants were collected at 30, 90, and 180 min following reincubation without Tat and analyzed for the presence of IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α. For experiments designed to determine the role of TNF-α in IL-1 and IL-6 production, the monocytes and astrocytes were preincubated with antisera to TNF-α (0.5 μg/ml; R&D Systems) for 30 min followed by incubation with 100 ng/ml Tat for either 5, 30, or 60 min. The cells were then washed and reincubated with culture media containing antisera to TNF-α. Culture supernatants were then analyzed after another 90 and 180 min for the presence of IL-1, IL-6, or TNF-α. Cells from two different donors were analyzed in triplicates. Data from a representative experiment are shown. To establish dose profiles for each cell type, Tat was used at 0, 10, 100, and 1000 ng/ml concentrations for 4 h with THP-1 cells for IL-1β and IL-6 mRNA detection in THP-1 cells and for 6 h with U373 cells. IL-1β and IL-6 proteins were analyzed in culture supernatants, 16 h post-Tat treatment. Since IL-1β could not be detected in cell culture supernatants of U373 cells, cell extracts of U373 cells were also measured at 1, 3, 6, 12, 24, and 48 h following treatment with 1 μg/ml Tat for IL-1β by ELISA. Cells were stimulated with lipopolysaccharide from Escherichia colitype 055:B5 (Sigma) 1.0 μg/ml as positive controls. Negative controls included mock (PBS)-treated cells and cells that were treated with solutions from which Tat had been immunoadsorbed as described previously (18Chen P. Mayne M. Power C. Nath A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22385-22388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Cell culture supernatants were analyzed for IL-1β, IL-6, or TNF-α. Additionally, cell extracts of U373 cells were analyzed for IL-1β. In each case, ELISA kits were used from R&D systems, and the procedure was followed as per the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, 200 μl of standard or sample was added to each well, which had been precoated with a murine monoclonal antibody (2 μg/ml) against the appropriate cytokine. Following a 2-h incubation with the test sample and three washes, 200 μl of a rabbit polyclonal antibody (diluted 1:1000) directed against the appropriate cytokine was added. One hour later, the plates were washed, color developed, and analyzed using a microtiter plate reader. A standard curve was generated on each microtiter plate, which was used for quantitating the amount of cytokine in each sample. The sensitivity of detection for IL-1β was 4 pg/ml, while that of IL-6 and TNF-α was 5 pg/ml. First strand cDNA was prepared from total cellular RNA as per the manufacturer's protocol (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). PCR was conducted using published primers for IL-1β, IL-6, and β-actin (19Yamamura M. Uyemura K. Deans R.J. Weinberg K. Rea T.H. Bloom B.R. Modlin R.L. Science. 1991; 254: 277-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (1065) Google Scholar). β-Actin primers served as internal controls in each reaction. PCR products were resolved in a 1.5% agarose gel and transferred to a nylon membrane and probed with [32P]ATP end-labeled oligonucleotide probes. IL-β, IL-6, and β-actin oligonucleotide probes were designed based on products amplified using the above primers (IL-1β, 5′-CTG CAC GCT CCG GGA CTC ACA CCA)-3′; IL-6, 5′AAT CGG GTA CAT CCT CGA CGG CAT CT-3′; β-actin, 5′-GAG ACC TTC AAC ACC CCA GCC ATG T-3′). U373 or THP-1 cells were washed in PBS, treated with EGTA (0.5 mm) or BAPTA (200 μm) for 10 min, followed by incubation with 100 ng/ml Tat in a calcium-free buffer for 1 h. Alternatively, the cells were pretreated with 100 μm TLCK (Sigma) for 30 min followed by treatment with 100 ng/ml Tat for 6 h in serum-containing medium. mRNA expression in each case was analyzed by RT-PCR and Southern blot analysis. To determine the effect of a transient exposure of Tat on cytokine production, we treated monocytes and astrocytes with concentrations of Tat (100 ng/ml) previously shown to induce cytokine production in these cells (18Chen P. Mayne M. Power C. Nath A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22385-22388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 20Rautonen N. Rautonen J. Martin N.L. Wara D.W. AIDS. 1994; 8: 1504-1506Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 21New D.R. Maggirwar S.B. Epstein L.G. Dewhurst S. Gelbard H.A. J. Biol.

Immunol. 1997; 159: 4077-4083PubMed Google Scholar). We found that a 5-min exposure to Tat was sufficient to induce maximal amounts of proinflammatory cytokines IL-1β, IL-6, or TNF-α in the monocytes (Fig.1, A–C) and IL-6 in the astrocytes (Fig. 1 D). IL-1β or TNF-α could not be detected in the astrocyte culture supernatants at all time points tested. To determine whether the IL-1β or IL-6 production in these cells was regulated via TNF-α, we analyzed the ability of TNF antisera to inhibit IL-1β or IL-6 production. IL-1β and IL-6 induction by Tat was independent of TNF-α production (Fig. 1,A, B, and D). Even though we used highly purified cultures of monocytes and astrocytes, we could not exclude the possibility of small amounts of other contaminating cell types in these cultures. Hence we used a human monocytoid (THP-1) and astrocytic (U373) cells for further experiments. We have previously characterized Tat-induced TNF-α in these cells (18Chen P. Mayne M. Power C. Nath A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22385-22388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Hence, to determine the effect of Tat on the production of cytokines IL-1β and IL-6, we treated THP-1 and U373 cells with Tat and measured IL-1β and IL-6 in the culture supernatants. Increasing levels of IL-1β were produced by THP-1 cells in a dose-dependent manner. Significant increases were noted with concentrations of 100 ng/ml Tat (Fig.2 A). To determine whether the induction of IL-1β occurred at the level of transcription or translation, we estimated IL-1β mRNA levels in THP-1 cells by RT-PCR. Tat induced IL-1β mRNA expression in a dose-dependent manner. The RT-PCR was much more sensitive and was able to detect IL-1β mRNA induction with 10 ng/ml Tat (Fig. 2 D). The U373 cells did not produce detectable levels of IL-1β in the culture supernatants, even with 1 μg/ml Tat. Since stimuli such as IL-1α and IL-2 result in production of cell associated IL-1β (23Dinarello C.A. Immunol. Lett. 1987; 16: 227-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar,24Numerof R.P. Kotik A.N. Dinarello C.A. Mier J.W. Cell Immunol. 1990; 130: 118-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), we tested cell extracts for the presence of IL-1β but were still unable to detect any IL-1β protein (data not shown). To determine whether the block in IL-1β production was at the level of transcription or translation, we measured mRNA levels in Tat treated U373 cells. IL-1β mRNA levels in U373 cells were comparable with that of THP-1 cells (Fig. 2, D andE). Hence there was a translation block in the U373 cells. Significant amounts of IL-6 were produced in the culture supernatants of THP-1 cells and the U373 cells (Fig. 2, B andC). Comparatively, however, the U373 cells produced nearly 20-fold more IL-6 than the THP-1 cells at both 100 ng/ml and 1 μg/ml concentrations of Tat. IL-6 mRNA production paralleled the production of IL-6 protein in U373 cells (Fig. 2, C andF) and THP-1 cells (data not shown). We next conducted experiments to determine whether a transient exposure to Tat would be sufficient to induce cytokine production in U373 and THP-1 cells. A 5-min incubation was insufficient for inducing TNF-α or IL-1β in THP-1 cells, but was sufficient to induce IL-6 production in U373 cells at 180 min post Tat exposure (Fig.3). Following a 30- or 60-min exposure to Tat, all three cytokines could be induced. A 60-min exposure led to higher levels and earlier release of cytokines (Fig. 3). We used highly purified Tat protein in all our experiments and have previously shown the specificity of Tat action (18Chen P. Mayne M. Power C. Nath A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22385-22388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 25Magnuson D.S. Knudsen B.E. Geiger J.D. Brownstone R.M. Nath A. Ann. Neurol. 1995; 37: 373-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). However, to further determine whether there were any contaminating substances that may result in IL-1β or IL-6 production, we immunoadsorbed Tat and used the remaining solution for treating the cells. The cell extracts were analyzed for IL-1β and IL-6 mRNA levels, since this was a much more sensitive technique for detection of Tat effects as compared with cytokine detection in culture supernatants. A complete block in IL-1β and IL-6 mRNA production was noted as shown in the U373 cells (Fig. 4), demonstrating that our Tat preparations are devoid of other bioactive substances. Previous studies have shown that Tat induces NFκB activation (26Conant K. Ma M. Nath A. Major E.O. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 1384-1389Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and that Tat-induced TNF-α production is NFκB-dependent (18Chen P. Mayne M. Power C. Nath A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22385-22388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Hence, we pretreated the cells with TLCK, an inhibitor of NFκB activation followed by incubation with Tat. A complete block in IL-1β and IL-6 production was noted in the U373 cells (Fig.5, A and B) and the THP-1 cells (data not shown). We examined the role of extracellular divalent cations including calcium in Tat-induced cytokine production. Neither EGTA nor BAPTA was able to block cytokine production. Fig.5 C shows the effect on IL-1β production in U373 cells. A similar lack of response was seen for IL-6 production in U373 cells and IL-1β and IL-6 production in THP-1 cells (data not shown). Our studies show that cytokine expression in monocytes and astrocytes are differentially regulated by Tat. While monocytes could be induced to produce all three cytokines, i.e. IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α, astrocytes produced only IL-6. The levels of IL-6 produced by astrocytic cells were nearly 20-fold greater than those produced by monocytic cells. The astrocytic cells did not produce measurable amounts of IL-1β, even though mRNA for IL-1β could be induced. Similarly, we have shown previously that Tat could induce only small amounts of TNF-α in the astrocytic cells (18Chen P. Mayne M. Power C. Nath A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22385-22388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we were unable to inhibit the production of IL-6 with antisera to TNF-α in astrocytes or monocytes. This is an interesting observation, since IL-1β and TNF-α have been shown to induce IL-6 gene expression in astrocytes (27Norris J.G. Tang L. Sparacio S.M. Benveniste E.N. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 841-850PubMed Google Scholar). This suggests that the effect of Tat on IL-6 production is specific. Within the brain, IL-1β is primarily produced by activated microglia (brain macrophages) (28Lee S.C. Dickson D.W. Liu W. Brosnan C.F. J. Neuroimmunol. 1993; 46: 19-24Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). HIV-infected macrophages also release high levels of IL-1β (29Genis P. Jett M. Bernton E.W. Boyle T. Gelbard H.A. Dzenko K. Keane R.W. Resnick L. Mizrachi Y. Volsky D.J. Epstein L. Gendelman H. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 176: 1703-1718Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar). Our studies show that Tat protein may, at least in part, contribute to the elevation of IL-1β levels in the brain of patients with HIV dementia. Tat-induced IL-1β is independent of TNF-α production. The increase in IL-1β may induce astrocytosis (30da Cunha A. Jefferson J.J. Tyor W.R. Glass J.D. Jaznnotta F.S. Vitkovic L. Brain Res. 1993; 631: 39-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), promote HIV-1 replication (31Poli G. Fauci A.S. Pathobiology. 1992; 60: 246-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), and induce other cytokines such as TNF-α (28Lee S.C. Dickson D.W. Liu W. Brosnan C.F. J. Neuroimmunol. 1993; 46: 19-24Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar), resulting in further brain injury. Tat-treated astrocytic cells not only produced large amounts of IL-6, but the elevated levels were present for prolonged periods. Several studies have shown that astrocytes are an important source of IL-6 (32Benveniste E.N. Sparacio S.M. Norris J.G. Grenett H.E. Fuller G.M. J. Neuroimmunol. 1990; 30: 201-212Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). IL-6 has prominent effects on the brain, which include activation of the hypothalamic pituitary-adrenal axis, decreased appetite, and neuronal growth (33Akira S. Kishimoto T. Immunol. Rev. 1992; 313: 47-50Google Scholar). Furthermore, IL-6 has been implicated in neuronal degeneration. Transgenic mice with IL-6 develop severe neurologic disease accompanied with neurodegeneration and astrocytosis (34Campbell I.L. Abraham C.R. Masliah E. Kemper P. Inglis J.D. Oldstone M.B. Mucke L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10061-10065Crossref PubMed Scopus (882) Google Scholar). IL-6 has also been implicated in pathogenesis of neuronal injury in Alzheimer's disease (35Hull M. Fiebich B.L. Lieb K. Strauss S. Berger S.S. Volk B. Bauer J. Neurobiol. Aging. 1996; 17: 795-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Tat has been shown to induce changes in intracellular calcium in neurons through an influx of extracellular calcium (36Haughey N.J. Nath A. Holden C.P. Geiger J.D. J. Neurovirol. 1998; 4: 353Google Scholar). We hence examined the role of extracellular calcium in Tat-induced cytokine production. Removal of extracellular calcium had no effect on cytokine production. These observations are interesting since a recent study showed that calcium channel antagonists do not significantly alter the course of HIV dementia (37Navia B.A. Dafni U. Simpson D. Tucker T. Singer E. McArthur J.C. Yiannoutsos C. Zaborski L. Lipton S.A. Neurology. 1998; 51: 221-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Previous studies have shown NFκB activation in the brains of patients with HIV infection (38Dollard S.C. James H.J. Sharer L.R. Epstein L.G. Gelbard H.A. Dewhurst S. Neuropathol. Appl. Neurobiol. 1995; 21: 518-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Further Tat induces NFκB activation in glial cells (26Conant K. Ma M. Nath A. Major E.O. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 1384-1389Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We now show that Tat-induced cytokine production is likely NFκB-dependent. Interestingly, the same cytokines have also been shown to activate NFκB itself (39Lowenthal J.W. Ballard D.W. Bohnlein E. Greene W.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 2331-2335Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Thus cytokine production once initiated by Tat could result in a positive feedback loop between NFκB and cytokine production. This process may therefore lead to an amplification of cytokine production without requiring the continued presence of Tat. Importantly, in this study we show that exposure to Tat for even a few minutes is sufficient to induce cytokine production in monocytes and astrocytes for prolonged periods of time. These findings are consistent with our previous observations that, following a single intraventricular injection of Tat in rats, progressive glial activation and macrophage infiltration could be seen for several days, even though Tat itself could not be detected in the brain after a few hours (12Jones M. Olafson K. Del Bigio M.R. Peeling J. Nath A. J. Neuropathol. Exp. Neurol. 1998; 57: 563-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Furthermore, an exposure of Tat in the order of only milliseconds is sufficient to induce prolonged depolarization in neurons (25Magnuson D.S. Knudsen B.E. Geiger J.D. Brownstone R.M. Nath A. Ann. Neurol. 1995; 37: 373-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar, 40Cheng J. Nath A. Knudsen B. Hochman S. Geiger J.D. Ma M. Magnuson D.S.K. Neuroscience. 1998; 82: 97-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Together, these studies suggest that a transient exposure to HIV-Tat protein results in a cascade of events leading to glial cell activation and neuronal degeneration. We thus propose that a “hit and run” phenomenon may be operative in neuropathogenesis of HIV infection, which may also explain why cross-sectional measurements of viral load in the brain at autopsy do not always correlate with neuronal degeneration and dementia.

https://openalex.org/W1607247437,"β-Adrenergic receptors (β-ARs) are members of the superfamily of G-protein-coupled receptors that mediate the effects of catecholamines in the sympathetic nervous system. Three distinct β-AR subtypes have been identified (β1-AR, β2-AR, and β3-AR). In order to define further the role of the different β-AR subtypes, we have used gene targeting to inactivate selectively the β2-AR gene in mice. Based on intercrosses of heterozygous knockout (β2-AR +/−) mice, there is no prenatal lethality associated with this mutation. Adult knockout mice (β2-AR −/−) appear grossly normal and are fertile. Their resting heart rate and blood pressure are normal, and they have a normal chronotropic response to the β-AR agonist isoproterenol. The hypotensive response to isoproterenol, however, is significantly blunted compared with wild type mice. Despite this defect in vasodilation, β2-AR −/− mice can still exercise normally and actually have a greater total exercise capacity than wild type mice. At comparable workloads, β2-AR −/− mice had a lower respiratory exchange ratio than wild type mice suggesting a difference in energy metabolism. β2-AR −/− mice become hypertensive during exercise and exhibit a greater hypertensive response to epinephrine compared with wild type mice. In summary, the primary physiologic consequences of the β2-AR gene disruption are observed only during the stress of exercise and are the result of alterations in both vascular tone and energy metabolism. β-Adrenergic receptors (β-ARs) are members of the superfamily of G-protein-coupled receptors that mediate the effects of catecholamines in the sympathetic nervous system.

As part of the sympathetic nervous system, β-ARs have been shown to have important roles in cardiovascular, respiratory, metabolic, central nervous system, and reproductive functions. Using techniques of molecular cloning, three distinct β-AR subtypes have been identified (β1-AR, β2-AR, and β3-AR) (1Dixon R.A. Kobilka B.K. Strader D.J. Benovic J.L. Dohlman H.G. Frielle T.

A. 1987; 84: 7920-7924Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar). All three of these β-AR subtypes are believed to signal by coupling to the stimulatory G-protein Gsα leading to activation of adenylyl cyclase and accumulation of the second messenger cAMP (1Dixon R.A. Kobilka B.K. Strader D.J. Benovic J.L. Dohlman H.G. Frielle T. Bolanowski M.A. Bennett C.D. Rands E. Diehl R.E. Mumford R.A. Slater E.E. Sigal I.S. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Strader C.D.

A. 1987; 84: 7920-7924Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar). Because of the diverse physiological functions mediated by β-ARs, much effort has been spent in understanding the roles of individual β-AR subtypes. In the past, researchers have relied on pharmacological tools such as subtype-selective agonists and antagonists to probe the function of the different β-AR subtypes. The presence of multiple β-AR subtypes was first suggested by Lands and co-workers (4Lands A.M. Arnold A. McAuliff J.P. Luduena F.P. Brown Jr., T.G. Nature. 1967; 214: 597-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (1648) Google Scholar, 5Lands A.M. Luduena F.P. Buzzo H.J. Life Sci. 1967; 6: 2241-2249Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar) who divided β-ARs into β1-ARs and β2-ARs. According to Lands' classification, β1-ARs mediate cardiac stimulation, and β2-ARs mediate smooth muscle relaxation in the peripheral vasculature and respiratory system. The presence of a third β-AR subtype was suggested when some of the effects of β-AR agonists could not be efficiently blocked by typical β-AR antagonists. This third β-AR subtype is now known as the β3-AR and has been shown to have important roles in adipose tissue and the gastrointestinal tract (6Strosberg A.D. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1997; 37: 421-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Although both β1-ARs and β2-ARs are expressed in the heart of most mammalian species, β1-ARs are expressed at higher levels and are recognized as playing the major role in regulating cardiac function. Functional studies have confirmed that activation of β1-ARs leads to increased heart rate and force of contraction (7Brodde O.E. Pharmacol. Rev. 1991; 43: 203-242PubMed Google Scholar). Although they represent a smaller population in the heart than β1-ARs, β2-ARs have also been shown to play a role in regulating cardiac function in a variety of species (7Brodde O.E. Pharmacol. Rev. 1991; 43: 203-242PubMed Google Scholar, 8Takei M. Furukawa Y. Narita M. Murakami M. Ren L.M. Karasawa Y. Chiba S. Jpn. J. Pharmacol. 1992; 59: 23-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 9Kaumann A.J. Naunyn-Schmiedebergs Arch. Pharmacol. 1986; 332: 406-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). In studies using subtype-selective agonists and antagonists in the human heart, β2-AR stimulation leads to activation of adenylyl cyclase and contributes to both inotropic and chronotropic responses (7Brodde O.E. Pharmacol. Rev. 1991; 43: 203-242PubMed Google Scholar). In the murine heart, however, β2-ARs do not appear to couple to inotropic or chronotropic responses. When isolated cardiac muscle from β1-AR knockout mice is stimulated with the non-subtype-selective β-AR agonist isoproterenol, neither inotropic nor chronotropic responses are observed (10Rohrer D.K. Desai K.H. Jasper J.R. Stevens M.E. Regula Jr., D.P. Barsh G.S. Bernstein D. Kobilka B.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7375-7380Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). In addition to their roles in the heart, β-ARs also regulate peripheral vascular tone. Stimulation of peripheral β-ARs leads to relaxation of vascular smooth muscle, thereby controlling the distribution of blood flow to different tissues. During exercise, for example, stimulation of β-ARs contributes to the increased blood flow to skeletal muscle. Based on the studies of Lands and co-workers (4Lands A.M. Arnold A. McAuliff J.P. Luduena F.P. Brown Jr., T.G. Nature. 1967; 214: 597-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (1648) Google Scholar,5Lands A.M. Luduena F.P. Buzzo H.J. Life Sci. 1967; 6: 2241-2249Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar), the β-AR in the peripheral vasculature have been classified as the β2-AR. Some reports, however, have shown roles for the other β-AR subtypes, β1-ARs and β3-ARs, in the peripheral vasculature (11Shen Y.T. Zhang H. Vatner S.F. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1994; 268: 466-473PubMed Google Scholar, 12Shen Y.T. Cervoni P. Claus T. Vatner S.F. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1996; 278: 1435-1443PubMed Google Scholar, 13Vatner S.F. Knight D.R. Hintze T.H. Am. J. Physiol. 1985; : H49-H56PubMed Google Scholar). Although much has been learned about the role of individual β-AR subtypes using classical pharmacological techniques, these studies are complicated by the fact that subtype-selective ligands are never perfectly selective. Moreover, at the doses required to block β-ARsin vivo, most β-AR ligands lose much of their subtype selectivity and may bind to other G-protein-coupled receptors such as serotonin receptors and dopamine receptors. Studies with β-AR ligands are especially difficult to interpret in vivo where it is hard to estimate the concentration of ligands and their metabolites in target tissues. In order to further investigate the roles of the different β-AR subtypes in physiology, we have selectively inactivated the β2-AR gene in mice using gene-targeting techniques. The knockout (β2-AR −/−) mice appear grossly normal and are fertile. Resting cardiovascular physiology is remarkably unperturbed in β2-AR −/− mice. The major effects of β2-AR gene disruption were observed only during the stress of exercise. β2-AR −/− mice were able to exercise farther and with a lower respiratory exchange ratio at any given workload than wild type controls. However, they are hypertensive during exercise, suggesting an imbalance between the vasoconstrictive and vasorelaxant effects of endogenous catecholamines. The targeting vector was constructed using sequence that had been cloned from a C57BL/6 mouse genomic library (14Allen J.M. Baetge E.E. Abrass I.B. Palmiter R.D. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 133-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In total, the targeting vector contained 11.4 kb of homology to the endogenous β2-AR genomic locus. The gene for the β2-AR was disrupted in the targeting vector by placing a neomycin (neo) resistance gene cassette into the coding sequence at a uniqueClaI site (15Soriano P. Montgomery C. Geske R. Bradley A. Cell. 1991; 64: 693-702Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1799) Google Scholar). This insertion disrupts the β2-AR at the end of the fourth transmembrane segment and should produce a nonfunctional receptor. The short arm of the targeting vector was a 2.6-kb fragment from a 5′ EcoRI site to the ClaI in the receptor. The long arm of the targeting vector (8.8 kb) extended from the ClaI site in the receptor to a downstreamSalI site. Also included in the vector was the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase cassette to allow for negative selection when isolating ES cell clones (15Soriano P. Montgomery C. Geske R. Bradley A. Cell. 1991; 64: 693-702Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1799) Google Scholar). In order to screen for homologous recombinants a 5′ external probe was used. This probe is a 300-base pair BamHI/EcoRI fragment that detects a 4.9-kb fragment after mouse genomic DNA is digested with BamHI and then subjected to Southern blot analysis. In cases where the targeting vector has homologously recombined with the endogenous locus, the same probe would detect an additional band at 6.6 kb. R1 embryonic stem (ES) (16Nagy A. Rossant J. Nagy R. Abramow-Newerly W. Roder J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8424-8428Crossref PubMed Scopus (1982) Google Scholar) cells were transfected using standard techniques (17). ES cells were grown on a monolayer of mouse embryonic fibroblasts in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (UCSF tissue culture facility, San Francisco) supplemented with 20% fetal bovine serum (HyClone, Logan, UT), 1 mm sodium pyruvate (Life Technologies, Inc.), non-essential amino acids, and penicillin/streptomycin (UCSF Cell Culture Facility, San Francisco, CA), 10−4m β-mercaptoethanol (Specialty Media, Lavallette, NJ), and 2,000 units/ml of leukemia inhibitory factor (ESGRO; Life Technologies, Inc.). Cells were grown in an incubator at 37 °C in 95% air, 5% CO2. For the transfection, a 10-cm2 dish of ES cells was transfected via electroporation with 20 μg of targeting vector previously linearized with NotI. After selecting ES cells for 9 days in media containing G418 (Life Technologies, Inc.) and gancyclovir (Syntex, Palo Alto, CA), individual clones were picked and subcloned in 96-well plates. BamHI-digested DNA from clones was analyzed by Southern blot analysis with the 5′ external probe. Nine homologous recombinants were isolated from 300 ES cell clones. Homologous recombinants were also screened with a neo probe to confirm that a single integration of the targeting vector had occurred. Chimeric mice were generated using the morula aggregation technique described previously (18Wood S.A. Allen N.D. Rossant J. Auerbach A. Nagy A. Nature. 1993; 365: 87-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Briefly, embryos at morula stage (2.5 days pc) were isolated from oviducts of superovulated CD-1 mice by flushing the oviducts with M2 medium (Specialty Media, Lavallette, NJ). After removing the zona pellucida with an acidic Tyrode's solution (Specialty Media, Lavallette, NJ), the embryos were placed in depressions in a 6-cm tissue culture dish and covered with a droplet of M16 medium (Specialty Media, Lavallette, NJ). A protective layer of mineral oil (Sigma) was placed over the droplets. Clumps of ES cells with the targeted disruption (10–20 cells) were then seeded into the depression and placed in contact with the embryos. After an overnight incubation at 37 °C in 95% air, 5% CO2, the chimeric embryos were transferred to the uteri of pseudopregnant CD-1 hosts (20–25 embryos per host). Chimeric mice were identified in the resulting offspring by the presence of dark coat color patches. Chimeric males were then mated to FVB/N female mice to screen for germ line transmission of the ES cell DNA. After achieving germ line transmission, β2-AR +/− mice were intercrossed to generate β2-AR +/+ and −/− mice for use in binding studies. For in vivo studies, the knockout allele was placed on a FVB/N background by backcrossing β2-AR +/− mice to wild type FVB/N mice for four additional generations (5 backcrosses to FVB/N in total). Whole lungs were dissected from wild type and knockout littermates, placed in a lysis buffer (10 mmTris-HCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.4), and homogenized with a Polytron (4 × 20-s bursts). The membrane fraction was isolated by centrifugation at 10,000 × g and resuspended in binding buffer (75 mm Tris-HCl, 12.5 mmMgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.4). Binding reactions were carried out by incubating membranes with the radioligand [125I]iodocyanopindolol (125I-CYP) (NEN Life Science Products) in 500-μl volumes. After a 2-h incubation at room temperature, vacuum filtration was performed, and the filters were counted in a gamma counter. For saturation experiments, 3 μg of membrane protein was incubated with increasing amounts of125I-CYP (1–300 pm). Nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of 1 μmdl-propanolol (Sigma). For competition experiments, binding reactions were set up with 50 pm125I-CYP, 3–6 μg of membrane protein, and varying concentrations (50 pm-13 μm) of the β2-AR-selective antagonist ICI 118,551 (Tocris Cookson, Ballwin, MO). Saturation and competition data were analyzed with GraphPAD software (GraphPAD Software Inc., San Diego, CA). In vivostudies were carried out as described previously (19Desai K.H. Sato R. Schauble E. Barsh G.S. Kobilka B.K. Bernstein D. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; : H1053-H1061PubMed Google Scholar). Adult male mice (12–16 weeks of age) were anesthetized with isofluorane using a vaporizer (Airco Inc., Madison, WI), and a stretched Intramedic PE10 polyethylene catheter (Clay Adams, Parsippany, NJ) was inserted into the left carotid artery. The catheter was tunneled through the neck and then placed in a subcutaneous pouch in the back. After a minimum of 16 h recovery, the saline-filled catheter was removed from the pouch and connected to a Spectramed DTX Plus pressure transducer (Spectramed, Oxnard, CA). Output from the pressure transducer was amplified using a Gould 8-channel recorder and digitized using a Data Translation Series DT2801 analog-digital converter (Marlboro, MA). The digital signal was analyzed using Crystal Biotech Dataflow data acquisition software (Crystal Biotech, Hopkinton, MA) on a Gateway 2000 486DX2 microcomputer (Sioux City, SD). Baseline heart rate and mean arterial blood pressure were recorded after a 1-h equilibration period when the animals were awake but not active. In order to examine drug responses, drugs were administered through the carotid artery catheter. (−)-Isoproterenol hydrochloride (3 μg/kg) and epinephrine bitartrate (3 μg/kg) were purchased from Sigma and dissolved in saline for injection. In order to measure heart rate and blood pressure during exercise, cannulated mice were challenged with a graded treadmill exercise protocol (19Desai K.H. Sato R. Schauble E. Barsh G.S. Kobilka B.K. Bernstein D. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; : H1053-H1061PubMed Google Scholar) on a Simplex II rodent treadmill (Columbus Instruments, Columbus, OH). Treadmill activity was initiated at 3.5 m/min, 0° inclination, and increased to 5 m/min, 2° inclination 3 min later. Treadmill speed and inclination were then increased by 2.5 m/min and 2° inclination every 3 min thereafter. Exercise was terminated after the mice had completed 3 min at 20 m/min, 14° inclination. Mice that failed to complete the exercise protocol were excluded from the study. In order to measure metabolic responses to exercise and exercise capacity, non-instrumented mice were challenged with the graded treadmill exercise protocol described above. Treadmill activity was initiated after the mice had equilibrated in the exercise chamber for 30–60 min. During the exercise protocol, oxygen consumption and carbon dioxide production were continuously monitored with an Oxymax gas analyzer (Columbus Instruments, Columbus, OH). Stepwise increases in treadmill speed and inclination were made every 3 min until the mice stopped running from exhaustion. Exercise capacity was calculated as the total distance run by the animals during the exercise protocol. Male mice, 12–13 weeks old, were used for these studies. Mice were maintained in 12-h light/dark cycles. On the day of study, food was removed from the cage at the beginning of the light cycle, and mice were studied 3–5 h later. Each mouse was weighed and then anesthetized with 5% isofluorane for 45 s in an anesthesia induction box. The mouse was quickly removed from the box, and blood was collected by cardiac puncture with a 22-guage needle. The mouse was then sacrificed via cervical dislocation. The volume of the mouse was determined by attaching a weight to the mouse and measuring the water displacement. Density was calculated as the body weight divided by the volume. After the volume measurement, both epididymal fat pads were dissected from the animal and weighed. The proportional weight of the fat pads was calculated by dividing the fat pad weight by the total body weight. After the blood samples had clotted in serum separator tubes (Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ), the samples were spun at 17,000 × g for 5 min to isolate the serum. Free fatty acid levels were determined with an enzymatic colorimetric kit (Wako Chemicals, Germany). Glycerol levels were determined with an enzymatic colorimetric kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Locomotor activity of male mice, 12–13 weeks old, was measured by a photobeam cage system (San Diego Instruments, San Diego, CA). Mice were studied in pairs with a β2-AR +/+ mouse and a β2-AR −/− mouse placed in individual cages (30 × 50 cm). A frame containing 4 × 6 infrared photobeams was placed around each cage. Mice were placed in the cages at 5 p.m., and their activity was monitored as the number of beam breaks in a 48-h period. The mice used for these studies had not been used for any previous experiments. Using standard ES cell techniques, the R1 ES cell line was transfected with the β2-AR targeting vector shown in Fig. 1 A. Homologous recombinants were identified by performing Southern blot analysis using the 5′ external probe. Targeted clones were rescreened with a probe to the neomycin resistance gene to ensure that a single integration of the targeting vector had occurred (data not shown). Chimeric mice were generated with the targeted ES clones using the morula aggregation technique. Following germ line transmission of the knockout allele, heterozygous knockout pairs were intercrossed to generate β2-AR +/+, β2-AR +/−, and β2-AR −/− mice. Shown in Fig. 1 B is a Southern blot using DNA from the offspring of a β2-AR +/− intercross. After backcrossing β2-AR +/− mice to wild type FVB/N mice for 5 generations, β2-AR +/− mice were intercrossed. From 171 intercross progeny screened at weaning, 36 β2-AR +/+ mice, 91 β2-AR +/− mice, and 44 β2-AR −/− mice were identified. These results are consistent with the ratio predicted by Mendelian genetics (χ-squared = 1.45, p > 0.4). Thus, there is no embryonic or postnatal lethality associated with disruption of the β2-AR gene in mice. After maturing into adults, β2-AR −/− mice appear grossly normal and do not exhibit overtly abnormal behavior. Both β2-AR −/− males and females are fertile. In order to verify that the genetic modification prevents expression of the β2-AR gene, ligand binding experiments were performed using lung tissue isolated from β2-AR +/+ and −/− littermates. Saturation binding experiments with the radioligand [125I]iodocyanopindolol (125I-CYP) demonstrate a reduction in total binding in the β2-AR −/− mice (Fig. 2 A). TheB max is reduced from 990 fmol/mg in β2-AR +/+ mice to 360 fmol/mg in the β2-AR −/− mice (36% of the wild type value). Competition binding experiments were performed using the β2-AR-selective antagonist ICI 118,551 to characterize the residual125I-CYP binding in the β2-AR −/− mice (Fig.2 B). In lung membranes from wild type mice, the data were best fit by a biphasic curve with 62% high affinity ICI 118,551 binding (β2-AR) sites and 38% low affinity (β1-AR) sites. The competition binding data from β2-AR −/− mice were best fit with a one-site curve that has low affinity for ICI 118,551. Thus, the residual 125I-CYP-binding sites in β2-AR −/− lung are due to β1-ARs, confirming the loss of β2-AR-binding sites in β2-AR −/− mice. These data also demonstrate that there has not been a compensatory change in β1-AR expression in the lung as a result of the β2-AR gene disruption; β1-AR expression in β2-AR −/− mice is 330 fmol/mg protein, whereas in β2-AR +/+ mice, β1-AR expression is 380 fmol/mg protein (0.38 × 990 fmol/mg protein). In order to examine the effects of the gene disruption on whole animal physiology, β2-AR +/+ and β2-AR −/− mice were instrumented with carotid catheters to allow measurements of mean arterial blood pressure and heart rate in awake, non-anesthetized, and non-restrained mice. Under baseline resting conditions, mean blood pressure and heart rate were not significantly different between β2-AR +/+ and β2-AR −/− mice (TableI). In order to examine the effects of β-AR stimulation, β2-AR +/+ and β2-AR −/− mice were given an intra-arterial bolus of 3 μg/kg of the non-selective β-AR agonist isoproterenol, a dose previously shown to produce maximal increases in heart rate and maximal reductions in blood pressure in wild type mice. Fig. 3 shows the typical response of a β2-AR +/+ and a β2-AR −/− mouse to isoproterenol. In β2-AR +/+ mice, isoproterenol produced a rapid onset tachycardia and hypotension. In β2-AR −/− mice, the tachycardic response to isoproterenol was preserved, but the hypotensive response was significantly blunted (Fig.3 and Table I).Table ICardiovascular indices at rest and changes in cardiovascular indices after isoproterenol (Iso) and epinephrine (Epi) administration in β2-AR +/+ and −/− miceGenotypeBasal HRBasal BPΔHR Iso stimulatedΔBP Iso stimulatedΔHR Epi stimulatedΔBP Epi stimulatedbpmmm Hgbpmmm Hgbpmmm Hgβ2-AR +/+641 ± 20113.5 ± 2.4141 ± 4023.6 ± 1.719 ± 3213.2 ± 1.9(10)(10)(7)(7)(7)(7)β2-AR −/−602 ± 42114.2 ± 1.9163 ± 5612.6aSignificance at p = 0.0009 for comparing β2-AR +/+ and −/− mice. ± 1.9−22 ± 1727.1bSignificance at p = 0.0027 for comparing β2-AR +/+ and −/− mice. ± 3.2(9)(9)(7)(7)(7)(7)Values shown represent the mean ± S.E.

The epinephrine-stimulated values represent the maximum blood pressure change and the corresponding heart rate change after drug administration. The unpaired t test was used for statistical comparison between groups. Responses to the endogenous catecholamine, epinephrine (a combined α–AR and β-AR agonist), were also significantly different between β2-AR −/− and wild type mice (Fig.4). In both β2-AR −/− and wild type mice, administration of epinephrine produced a transient hypertensive response (blood pressure typically returned to baseline within 1 min). However, the hypertensive response was significantly greater in β2-AR −/− mice than in wild types (Table I and Fig. 4). Heart rate responses in both β2-AR −/− and wild type mice to epinephrine were variable (Table I). Although there was a trend for wild type mice to show heart rate increases while β2-AR −/− showed heart rate decreases, these heart rate responses were not significantly different between genotypes. The effects of exercise on heart rate and blood pressure are shown in Fig. 5. For these experiments, catheterized mice were tested using a graded exercise treadmill protocol. β2-AR −/− and wild type mice showed similar heart rate increases during the exercise protocol. A significant difference, however, was observed in the blood pressure response to exercise. During the exercise protocol, β2-AR −/− mice became hypertensive compared with wild type mice. At the peak exercise level of 20 m/min, β2-AR −/− mice had a mean blood pressure of 139.3 ± 4.4 mm Hg (mean ± S.E.), whereas wild type mice had a mean blood pressure of 126.3 ± 3.3 mm Hg (mean ± S.E.). In a separate set of experiments, metabolic responses to exercise and exercise capacity were measured in uncatheterized mice. Oxygen consumption and carbon dioxide production were continuously monitored while the mice exercised according to a graded treadmill exercise protocol (Fig.6). Oxygen consumption and carbon dioxide production were not significantly different between the two genotypes. However, there was a trend for β2-AR −/− mice to have greater levels of oxygen consumption at any given workload. β2-AR −/− mice had a significantly lower respiratory exchange ratio during exercise than did wild type mice (Fig. 6 C). There was also a significant difference between β2-AR +/+ mice and β2-AR −/− mice in exercise capacity. Interestingly, β2-AR −/− mice exercised significantly longer than wild type control mice (Fig. 6 D). Wild type mice covered 471 ± 22 meters (mean ± S.E.), whereas β2-AR −/− mice covered 582 ± 15 meters (mean ± S.E.) during the graded exercise protocol. To investigate possible mechanisms for the greater exercise capacity in β2-AR −/− mice, we examined body weight, epididymal fat pad weight, body density, and serum levels of free fatty acid (FFA) and glycerol in wild type and β2-AR −/− mice. As shown in TableII, β2-AR −/− mice weigh significantly less than wild type mice. Epididymal fat pads from β2-AR −/− mice also represent a smaller proportion of total body weight than fat pads from wild type mice. Previous studies have shown that the epididymal fat pad weight as a proportion of total body weight is highly correlated with total body fat in mice (20Rogers P. Webb G.P. Br. J. Nutr. 1980; 43: 83-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 21Eisen E.J. Leatherwood J.M. Growth. 1981; 45: 100-107PubMed Google Scholar). Body density, serum FFA levels, and serum glycerol levels were not significantly different between the two genotypes under base-line conditions.Table IIBody weight, proportional weight of the epididymal fat pads, density, free fatty acid (FFA) levels, and glycerol levels in β2-AR +/+ and β2-AR −/− mice.GenotypeWeightFat padD"
https://openalex.org/W1974544823,"Molecular mechanisms coupling growth arrest and cell differentiation were examined during adipogenesis. Data are presented that document a cascade expression of members of two independent families of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors that define distinct states of growth arrest during 3T3-L1 preadipocyte differentiation. Exit from the cell cycle into a pre-differentiation state of post-mitotic growth arrest was characterized by significant increases in p21 and p27. During onset of irreversible growth arrest associated with terminal differentiation, the level of p21 declined with a concomitant, dramatic increase in p18 and a sustained level of p27. The expression of p18 and p21, regulated at the level of protein and mRNA accumulation, was directly coupled to differentiation. Stable cell lines were engineered to express adipogenic transcription factors to examine the active role of <i>trans</i>-acting elements in regulating these cell cycle inhibitors. Ectopic expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) γ in non-precursor fibroblastic cell lines resulted in conversion to adipocytes and a coordinated increase in p18 and p21 mRNA and protein expression in a PPARγ ligand-associated manner. These data demonstrate a role for PPARγ in mediating the differentiation-dependent cascade expression of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors, thereby providing a molecular mechanism coupling growth arrest and adipocyte differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W2164285416,"The activation state of β-adrenergic receptors (β-ARs) in vivo is an important determinant of hemodynamic status, cardiac performance, and metabolic rate. In order to achieve homeostasis in vivo, the cellular signals generated by β-AR activation are integrated with signals from a number of other distinct receptors and signaling pathways. We have utilized genetic knockout models to test directly the role of β1- and/or β2-AR expression on these homeostatic control mechanisms. Despite total absence of β1- and β2-ARs, the predominant cardiovascular β-adrenergic subtypes, basal heart rate, blood pressure, and metabolic rate do not differ from wild type controls. However, stimulation of β-AR function by β-AR agonists or exercise reveals significant impairments in chronotropic range, vascular reactivity, and metabolic rate. Surprisingly, the blunted chronotropic and metabolic response to exercise seen in β1/β2-AR double knockouts fails to impact maximal exercise capacity. Integrating the results from single β1- and β2-AR knockouts as well as the β1-/β2-AR double knock-out suggest that in the mouse, β-AR stimulation of cardiac inotropy and chronotropy is mediated almost exclusively by the β1-AR, whereas vascular relaxation and metabolic rate are controlled by all three β-ARs (β1-, β2-, and β3-AR). Compensatory alterations in cardiac muscarinic receptor density and vascular β3-AR responsiveness are also observed in β1-/β2-AR double knockouts. In addition to its ability to define β-AR subtype-specific functions, this genetic approach is also useful in identifying adaptive alterations that serve to maintain critical physiological setpoints such as heart rate, blood pressure, and metabolic rate when cellular signaling mechanisms are perturbed."

We demonstrate that uptake of long chain fatty acids was significantly stimulated in a time-dependent fashion in ADRP-expressing COS-7 cells compared with empty vector-transfected control cells.

Lipid Res. 1994; 35: 930-937Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Adipose tissue is the main source of lipids and fatty acids in the body where they play key roles in the regulation of energy balance in mammals. Proteins involved in FA and triglyceride synthesis and accumulation as well as utilization of exogenous lipid are induced during adipocyte differentiation (3Spiegelman B.M. Cook K.S. Hunt C.R. Prog. Clin. Biol. Res. 1986; 226: 445-454PubMed Google Scholar, 4MacDougald O.A. Lane M.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 345-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (934) Google Scholar). Increase of enzymatic activities regulating lipogenesis and lipolysis is also ongoing at this stage. These multiple roles of FA suggest that careful regulation of cellular aspects of FA metabolism including cellular uptake in liver, fat, cardiac and skeletal muscles, and other organs is essential. The mechanism by which long chain free FA enter the cells is not completely understood. It has long been postulated that the movement of long chain FA across the cell membrane is invariably passive (5DeGrella R.F. Light R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 9731-9738Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6DeGrella R.F. Light R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 9739-9745Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).

Chem. 1980; 255: 9739-9745Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have suggested that FA penetrate cardiac myocytes by a passive unregulated mechanism rather than by a specific facilitated process and that saturation of an intracellular metabolism step is the cause for apparent saturation of uptake in other studies. Others (7Noy N. Donnelly T.M. Zakim D. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 2013-2021Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) have also shown that the entry of FA into hepatocytes reflected their passive partitioning into the lipid component of the cell membrane. However, recent observations indicated that at least a portion of FA uptake might occur by a carrier-mediated transport system (8Stremmel W. Berk P.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 3086-3090Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 9Stremmel W. Strohmeyer G. Berk P.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 3584-3588Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Studies with liver, fat cells, cardiac tissue, and skeletal myocytes have shown that free FA uptake exhibited many of the kinetic properties of a facilitated process, namely saturation, trans-stimulation, cis-inhibition, stereospecificity, and counter transport (8Stremmel W.

Hepatol. 1992; 16: 304-315Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Several studies have indicated that FA uptake by adipocytes was phloretin-inhibitable and blocked by antibody raised against specific binding proteins (10Schwieterman W. Sorrentino D. Potter B.J.

Chem. 1981; 256: 9183-9191Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These features could not be explained by diffusion. It is then possible to assume that facilitated and passive uptake processes both occur simultaneously in cells (12Stump D.D. Nunes R.M. Sorrentino D. Berk P.D. J. Hepatol. 1992; 16: 304-315Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), with the facilitated transport being the predominant process. In support of these findings, five putative mammalian free FA transporters have been identified so far in the plasma membrane of several tissues (14Stremmel W. Strohmeyer G. Kochwa S. Berk P.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 4-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar, 15Abumrad N.A. el-Maghrabi M.R. Amri E.Z. Lopez E. Grimaldi P.A. J. Biol.

Cell. 1994; 79: 427-436Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (740) Google Scholar). In addition, small molecular weight cytosolic fatty acid-binding proteins have been characterized, cloned, and extensively studied (for review see Ref. 19Schroeder F. Jolly C.A. Cho T.H. Frolov A. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 1998; 92: 1-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Adipose differentiation related protein (ADRP) is a novel 50-kDa protein originally cloned by differential hybridization from a cDNA library of differentiated mouse 1246 adipocytes (20Jiang H.P. Serrero G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7856-7860Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). The 1.7-kilobase pair ADRP mRNA was induced 50–100-fold a few hours after the onset of adipose differentiation in 1246 cells, thus making ADRP an early marker of the adipose differentiation program (20Jiang H.P. Serrero G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7856-7860Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). It has been shown that ADRP mRNA was expressed at high levels in adipose tissue (20Jiang H.P. Serrero G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7856-7860Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar) and also in many different types of cells and tissues where lipids were accumulated or synthesized, although at lower levels than in adipocytes (21Brasaemle D.L. Barber T. Wolins N.E. Serrero G. Blanchette-Mackie E.J. Londos C. J. Lipid Res. 1997; 11: 2249-2263Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). Sequencing of ADRP did not provide any information about its possible function in adipocytes. Immunolocalization studies done at different times during the adipose differentiation program in 1246 and 3T3-L1 adipocytes indicated that ADRP was localized in the vicinity of the plasma membrane in cells that started to differentiate and was found on the surface of lipid droplets in mature adipocytes (20Jiang H.P. Serrero G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7856-7860Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar, 21Brasaemle D.L. Barber T. Wolins N.E. Serrero G. Blanchette-Mackie E.J. Londos C. J. Lipid Res. 1997; 11: 2249-2263Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). Moreover, ADRP expression was found to be induced in the liver of mice treated with the carnitine palmitoyltransferase I inhibitor, etomoxir, which caused neutral lipid accumulation in the organ (22Steiner S. Wahl D. Magold B.L.K. Robison R. Raymackers L. Metheus L. Anderson N.L. Cordier A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 218: 777-782Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). These various studies suggested that ADRP might be involved in the formation or stabilization of lipid droplets in adipocytes. As a first step to investigate this hypothesis, we have examined here whether ADRP was involved in FA uptake using ADRP-transfected COS-7 cells as an experimental model system. The results presented in this paper show that ADRP plays a role in facilitated FA transport in COS-7 cells expressing the protein. COS-7 cells (CRL 1651, American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) were cultivated in DME-F12 medium (1:1 mixture of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and Ham's nutrient F12 medium) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Life Technologies, Inc.) in T-75-cm2 plates. Cell stocks were cultivated in these conditions until nearly confluent and subcultured at 1:20 dilution or plated for an experiment. For expression into COS-7 cells, ADRP cDNA was cloned into the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Mouse ADRP cDNA fragment containing the 1.3-kilobase pair ADRP open reading frame was cloned in the sense orientation in XbaI and BamHI sites of pcDNA3. Expression of green fluorescent protein (GFP, CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) was used to monitor transfection efficiency. GFP plasmid DNA was co-transfected into COS-7 cells with pcDNA3 empty vector (control cells) or pcDNA3-ADRP vector plasmid DNA. Transient transfection of plasmid DNA into COS-7 cells was carried out by the DEAE-dextran method (23Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Ausubel F.M.

Briefly, 2 ml of a solution containing plasmid DNA and DEAE-dextran was prepared by mixing 0.2 ml of DEAE-dextran at 10 mg/ml, 5 pmol (about 10 μg) of plasmid DNA for each vector into 1.8 ml of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C with COS-7 cells cultivated in T-75-cm2 flasks. After 1 h, the cells were treated with 100 μm chloroquine for 4 h at 37 °C in serum-free culture medium followed by treatment with 10% dimethyl sulfoxide for 2 min. Cells were then washed twice with culture medium and then cultivated in DME/F12 medium supplemented with 10% FBS for 48 h for maximal ADRP expression in the transfected cells. Control cells were co-transfected with empty vector pcDNA3 and with GFP plasmid DNA using a similar method. Transfection efficiency was determined by counting the number of cells expressing GFP (co-transfected with either ADRP-pcDNA3 or with pcDNA3 empty vector) when compared with the total number of cells counted with a hemocytometer. ADRP protein expression in transfected COS cells was examined in cell lysates prepared from transfected COS-7 cells by Western blot analysis using rabbit anti-ADRP antibody. Briefly, cells were washed once with PBS and lysed in 1 ml of SDS sample buffer (62.5 mmTris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 10% glycerol) without β-mercaptoethanol and bromphenol blue (all chemicals were from Bio-Rad). The cell lysate was then sonicated at 40%, 20-watt output for 10 s using a Vibra Cell sonicator (Sonics & Materials Inc., Danbury, CT), and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min, and the supernatant was collected. The protein concentration of cell lysate was measured by using micro-BCA protein assay reagent kit (Pierce). After adding 1/10 volume of 10× loading dye (50% 2-Me, 1% bromphenol blue), equal amounts of protein (20 μg) from ADRP- and empty vector-transfected COS-7 cells were analyzed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate on a 10% gel followed by Western blot analysis to measure ADRP expression in both cell types. Conditions for SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis were similar to the ones described previously to measure ADRP expression in adipocytes (24Ye H. Serrero G. Biochem.

Transfection of ADRP or empty vector plasmid DNA was carried out as described above. After 48 h, cells were washed with PBS, fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde, and permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 using a previously described method (16Schaffer J.E. Lodish H.F. Cell. 1994; 79: 427-436Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (740) Google Scholar) followed by several washes with PBS. Cells were incubated with affinity purified anti-ADRP antibody for 1 h at room temperature followed by incubation with FITC-conjugated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Bio-Rad). After extensive washing with PBS, slides were mounted in buffered glycerol solution and examined with an Olympus BX40 fluorescence microscope equipped with an Olympus camera. [9,10-3H]Oleic acid (1.2 μCi/nmol) (NEN Life Science Products) and unlabeled oleic acid sodium salts were dissolved in 10 ml of water at 40 °C to give a concentration of about 320 μm (48 μCi/ml). When the solution was completely clear after ∼10 min, fatty acid-free BSA (Sigma) from a concentrated stock solution (20%) was added with gentle mixing to obtain a final concentration of 80 μm BSA and an oleic acid/BSA molar ratio of 4.0. For the assays, an aliquot of the stock solution of FA/BSA (320 μm) was diluted 1:8 with PBS containing or not containing additional fatty acid-free BSA to obtain the final desired concentrations of oleic acid (40 μm) and of fatty acid-free BSA (10, 13, 20, 40, and 80 μm) and oleic acid/BSA molar ratios of 4.0, 3.0, 2.0, 1.0, and 0.5, respectively. The final concentration of fatty acids in the assay was 20 μm [3H]oleic acid (3 μCi/ml) with various concentrations of fatty acid-free BSA. The unbound oleic acid concentration in the presence of BSA was determined from the oleate/BSA molar ratio according to the calculation of Abumrad et al.(13Abumrad N.A. Perkins R.C. Park J.H. Park C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 9183-9191Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), using the association constants of Spector and Fletcher (25Spector A.A. Fletcher J.E. Dietschy J.M.

Soc. 1946; 68: 1486-1490Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). [9,10-3H]Palmitic acid (43 μCi/nmol), [5,6,8,11,12,14,15-3H]arachidonic acid (222 μCi/nmol), and [1-14C]octanoic acid (55 μCi/μmol) (NEN Life Science Products) were diluted to 40 μm with a fatty acid-free BSA concentration of 10 μm. The final working concentration in the tubes was 20 μm[3H]palmitic acid (3.1 μCi/ml), [3H]arachidonic acid (1.3 μCi/ml), and [14C]octanoic acid (12 nCi/ml), respectively, with 5 μm fatty acid-free BSA. Transfected COS-7 cells were resuspended in PBS (5 × 105 cells/ml) in 15 ml of polypropylene centrifuge tubes. 200-μl aliquots of cell suspension (105 cells) were placed in 5-ml polypropylene centrifuge tubes. Cell suspensions in PBS were preincubated for 5 min at 37 °C in a shaking water bath. An equal volume of 2-fold concentrated stock fatty acid/BSA solutions was added to each tube to perform fatty acid uptake. At specific intervals, uptake was stopped by adding 5 ml of ice-cold PBS containing 0.1% BSA and 200 μm phloretin (wash solution) into each assay tube. Then the solutions and cell suspensions were filtered through GF/C filters (Whatman, Maidstone, UK) which had been presaturated with 15 ml of 0.1% BSA in PBS. Cells retained by filters were rapidly washed 3 times with 5 ml of cold wash solution. Filters were soaked overnight in 10 ml of scintillation mixture prior to counting with a liquid scintillation counter. Nonspecific fatty acid adsorbed to filters lacking cells was routinely measured and subtracted from experimental values. Background radioactivity representing isotope trapped extracellularly and bound nonspecifically by the cells was measured from zero time incubation determined by adding stop solution to the cells before adding radiolabeled fatty acid-BSA complex. Fatty acid uptake data were normalized with the transfection efficiency that had been determined by counting the number of fluorescent cells expressing GFP compared with the total cell number. Since non-transfected cells could also uptake fatty acid, it was necessary to remove their contribution to the total FA uptake in order to determine the contribution due to the expression of ADRP in the cells. To achieve this, the uptake of FA by non-transfected cells was determined by multiplying the value of total FA uptake in non-transfected control cells by the percentage of non-transfected cells (100% − transfection efficiency). Non-transfected control cells were treated similarly to transfected cells but without adding plasmid DNA of vectors used for transfection. The value for the remaining FA uptake contributed by the transfected cells was obtained by subtracting the nontransfected cells uptake from the total uptake measured experimentally. Then the remaining FA uptake of transfected cells was normalized to the transfection efficiency. The final amount of uptake was expressed as pmol per 105 transfected cells. The distribution of labeled oleate in intracellular lipids in ADRP-transfected or empty vector-transfected COS-7 cells was examined after uptake was performed. Uptake was carried out as described above. At various time points after uptake was stopped, cells from triplicate samples (6 × 105 cells) were washed by centrifugation. Lipids were immediately extracted by the method of Bligh and Dyer (27Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (42411) Google Scholar) from cells resuspended in 0.8 ml of PBS. Extracted lipids were resuspended in 100 μl of CHCl3/MeOH (2:1) and separated by thin layer chromatography (TLC) on a silica gel G plate (Analtech, Newark, DE) in the solvent mixture of hexane/ether/formic acid (60:40:1). Triolein, diolein, mono-olein, oleic acid, and 1-palmityl,2-oleyl lecithin (Sigma) were used as standards for the TLC. Lipid spots were visualized by iodine vapors and immediately scraped with a razor blade into scintillation vials to count radioactivity incorporated into intracellular lipids in ADRP and empty vector-transfected COS-7 cells. ADRP and empty vector-transfected COS-7 cells were transferred from T-75 flasks to 24-well plates, 24 h after transfection. After incubation at 37 °C for another 24 h, media were changed to DME/F12 without FBS. Cells were incubated at 37 °C for 3 h. The cells were then washed in Krebs-Ringer phosphate (KRP) buffer (137 mm NaCl, 4.7 mm KCl, 0.4 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 10 mmNa2HPO4/NaH2PO4 buffer, pH 7.3, 0.2% BSA) and incubated in KRP buffer for 2 h prior to performing the uptake. 200 μm2-[14C]deoxyglucose (1.6 μCi/ml) (NEN Life Science Products) was freshly added into KRP buffer. After 10, 20, and 30 min incubation at 37 °C, cells were washed 2 times with ice-cold KRP buffer and then dissolved in 200 μl of 0.1 m NaOH. 5 ml of scintillation mixture was added into each tube for scintillation counting. All experiments were repeated at least three times. The data presented here are expressed as mean ± S.D. Differences between experimental groups were evaluated with two-tailed Student's t tests. Differences were considered significant if p < 0.05. To test whether ADRP promoted FA transport, the pcDNA3 expression vector containing ADRP cDNA insert was transiently transfected into COS-7 cells. Plasmid DNA from empty pcDNA3 vector was transfected into COS-7 cells as control. Cells were harvested 48 h after transfection, and cell lysates were prepared as described under “Experimental Procedures,” in order to measure ADRP protein expression by Western blot analysis. As shown in Fig. 1, ADRP protein expression was very low in empty vector-transfected COS-7 cells. In contrast, cells transfected with the ADRP-pCDNA3 expression vector expressed high levels of ADRP protein equivalent to the one in 1246 adipocytes known to express high level of ADRP (19Schroeder F. Jolly C.A. Cho T.H. Frolov A. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 1998; 92: 1-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 24Ye H. Serrero G. Biochem. J. 1998; 330: 803-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) and used as positive controls. These results demonstrated that ADRP protein was effectively expressed in COS-7 cells and that the transfected COS-7 cells could be used as a model of ADRP protein overexpression to examine the function of ADRP in mammalian cells. Localization of ADRP in transfected COS-7 cells was examined by immunofluorescence staining of fixed cells with anti-ADRP antibody followed by FITC-conjugated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody. Fluorescence microscopy revealed a specific pattern of staining at the cell periphery in ADRP-transfected COS-7 cells (Fig.2 top panel) which was not observed in empty vector-transfected COS-7 cells (Fig. 2 bottom panel) or in cells incubated with preimmune IgG used as negative control (data not shown). Additional immunostaining was also found associated with the nucleus in ADRP-transfected cells as well as in control cells although with a lesser degree. These data show that ADRP is preferentially found associated with the plasma membrane in the transfected COS-7 cells. Assays of oleic acid transport were performed in control and in ADRP-expressing COS-7 cells. [3H]Oleate at a final concentration of 20 μm corresponding to an oleate/BSA molar ratio of 4:1 was incubated with 105 cells at 37 °C from 15 s to 30 min. Uptake was stopped by adding 5 ml of an ice-cold stop solution containing 200 μm phloretin and 0.1% BSA in PBS. Since the stop solution removed surface-bound [3H]oleate while blocking efflux from the cells of oleate already internalized (8Stremmel W. Berk P.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 3086-3090Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), accurate quantitation of cumulative cellular oleate uptake could be obtained after stop solution treatment. The [3H]oleate uptake measured as the total [3H]oleate accumulated in ADRP or empty vector-transfected cells was normalized to the transfection efficiency as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Fig. 3 showed the time course of oleate uptake in transfected COS-7 cells determined at 2.30 μm unbound oleic acid with an oleate/BSA ratio of 4:1 (mol/mol). The time course was biphasic with a fast early phase linear for up to 0.5 min (Fig. 3 A) followed by a slower phase (Fig.3 B) both for control and ADRP-transfected cells. In the later slower phase, the oleate uptake rate decreased although the cells continued to accumulate oleate. ADRP increased [3H]oleate uptake by about 3-fold over the uptake in control cells at all time points measured. Each of the two phases were significantly faster in ADRP-transfected cells than in control cells (p < 0.01 in each case). By 30 min, ADRP-transfected COS-7 cells had incorporated 401.0 ± 57.6 pmol/105 cells and control cells 194.6 ± 42.6 pmol/105 cells, respectively. These values were significantly different from each other (p< 0.01). The initial uptake rate determined by the slope of the linear portion of the uptake curve over the initial 0.5-min period (Fig.2 A) increased from 21.15 ± 0.46 pmol/105cells/min in control cells to 58.01 ± 9.48 pmol/105cells/min in ADRP-transfected cells (p < 0.01). Accurate quantitative measure of influx velocity could be obtained by measuring the initial uptake rate (8Stremmel W. Berk P.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 3086-3090Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). These data indicated that ADRP promoted [3H]oleate uptake in COS-7 cells by increasing the influx velocity of oleic acid. The distribution of the label in intracellular lipids in ADRP and control COS-7 cells at different time points of the uptake reaction was examined. For this purpose, cell-associated lipids were extracted by the Bligh-Dyer method and analyzed by thin layer chromatography as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Initially, the majority of the label was found in the free fatty acid pool. At 5 min, 35% of the label was found in the free fatty acids with 31% in the phospholipids and the rest in the neutral lipids. At 15 min, less than 10% of the label was found associated with free fatty acids, whereas 30% of the label was still found in the phospholipids and 60% in the neutral lipid pools. The same distribution of label over time was observed in empty vector-transfected cells indicating that ADRP did not change the distribution of label in the intracellular lipids but simply increased the level of uptake of fatty acids. The kinetics of [3H]oleic acid uptake by ADRP was assessed by examining oleate uptake over a 15-s period within a range of unbound oleic acid concentrations from 0.043 to 2.30 μm corresponding to a molar ratio of oleate/BSA of 0.5 to 4, respectively. As shown in Fig. 4, the uptake in control and ADRP-transfected cells was saturable. [3H]Oleate uptake velocity in control cells and ADRP-transfected cells reached a plateau at concentrations above 0.11 μm unbound oleic acid. After a 15-s incubation, the [3H]oleic acid uptake velocity in ADRP-transfected COS-7 cells was significantly higher than that of control cells at this range of oleic acid concentrations (p < 0.01). From a double-reciprocal plot of these data, the transportK m of ADRP was determined to be 0.051 μm and V max was 57.97 pmol/105 cells/min, whereas K m was 0.093 μm and V max was 20.13 pmol/105 cells/min in control cells. These results suggested that ADRP had the function of facilitating the uptake of fatty acid by increasing fatty acid uptake velocity. Uptake of [3H]oleate was also examined at"
https://openalex.org/W1977657343,"NG2 is a transmembrane chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan that is expressed by immature progenitor cells in several developmental lineages and by some types of malignant cells. In vitro studies have suggested that NG2 participates in growth factor activation of the platelet-derived growth factor-α receptor. In this study the ability of recombinant NG2 core protein to interact with several different growth factors (epidermal growth factor (EGF), basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-AA, PDGF-BB, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)165 and transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1) was investigated using two different assay systems: enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay-type solid-phase binding and an optical biosensor (BIAcore) system. High-affinity binding of bFGF and PDGF-AA to the core protein of NG2 could be demonstrated with both types of assays. Using both the BIAcore software analysis program and nonlinear regression analysis of the solid phase binding data, K D values in the low nanomolar range were obtained for binding of each of these growth factors to NG2. The results further indicate that NG2 contains at least two binding sites for each of these two growth factors. PDGF-BB, TGF-β1, VEGF, and EGF exhibited little or no binding to NG2 in either type of assay. These data suggest that NG2 can have an important role in organizing and presenting some types of mitogenic growth factors at the cell surface.

Due to their structural complexity, proteoglycans are highly interactive macromolecules that participate in a broad range of cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions, including regulation of cell adhesion, proliferation, motility, and differentiation (Refs. 1Iozzo R.V. Murdoch A.D. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 598-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar, 2David G. FASEB J. 1993; 7: 1023-1030Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar, 3Hocking A.M. Shinomura T.

FASEB J. 1996; 10: 598-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar). Proteoglycans are important mediators of growth factor binding. Several examples illustrate how proteoglycans can function both as extracellular reservoirs for growth factors and as facilitators of growth factor binding to signal transducing receptors on the cell surface (4Schlessinger J. Lax I. Lemon M. Cell. 1995; 83: 357-360Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar, 5Rapraeger A.C. Guimond S. Krufka A. Olwin B.B.

Most research has focused on the interaction of growth factors with the glycosaminoglycan (GAG) 1The abbreviations used are: GAG, glycosaminoglycan; bFGF, basic fibroblast growth factor; BSA, bovine serum albumin; EGF, epidermal growth factor; PDGF, platelet-derived growth factor; VEGF, vascular endothelial growth factor; SPR, surface plasmon resonance; TGF-β1, transforming growth factor-β1; HRP, horseradish peroxidase; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay chains of proteoglycans. bFGF (FGF-2) binds tightly to the heparan sulfate chains of extracellular proteoglycans, as well as to free heparin (7Aviezer D. Hecht D. Safran M. Elsinger M. David G. Yayon A. Cell. 1994; 79: 1005-1013Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar, 8Aviezer D. Levy M. Safran M. Svahn C. Buddecke E. Schmidt A. David G. Vlodavsky I. Yayon A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 114-121Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Since the bound growth factor is resistant to degradation by extracellular proteases, the complex serves as a reservoir of matrix-bound FGF. Active FGF is released by proteolysis of the proteoglycan core protein or by partial degradation of the heparan sulfate chains, processes that occur during tissue development and remodeling (9Nurcombe N. Ford M.D. Wildschut P.F. Bartlett P. Science. 1993; 260: 103-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar, 10Yayon A. Klagsbrun M. Esko J.D. Leder P. Ornitz D.M. Cell. 1991; 64: 841-848Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2094) Google Scholar). bFGF also binds to cell-surface heparan sulfate proteoglycans such as syndecan, which present the bound FGF to its signaling receptor, a receptor tyrosine kinase whose activation leads to induction of a variety of cellular processes, including proliferation. Binding of bFGF has also been demonstrated to the core protein of the chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan phosphacan (11Milev P. Monnerie H. Popp S. Margolis R.K. Margolis R.U. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21439-21442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). TGF-β is another growth factor that can bind to proteoglycan core proteins. For example, betaglycan (also called the type III TGF-β1 receptor) is a transmembrane proteoglycan with multiple binding sites for TGF-β1 (12Kaname S. Ruoslahti E. Biochem. J. 1996; 315: 815-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Upon binding to betaglycan, TGF-β1 is presented to types I and II receptors, which are serine/threonine kinases that activate intracellular signaling cascades. Results from our laboratory have suggested that the integral membrane chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan NG2 is another example of a proteoglycan that can influence growth factor activity. NG2 is found on the surface of several different types of immature progenitor cells, including oligodendrocyte progenitors, chondroblasts, and smooth muscle cells (13Stallcup W.B. Beasley L. J. Neurosci. 1987; 7: 2737-2744Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Nishiyama A. Dahlin K.J. Stallcup W.B. Development (Camb.). 1991; 111: 933-944PubMed Google Scholar, 15Nishiyama A. Lin X.H. Giese N.

Some types of neoplasms, such as melanomas, glioblastomas, osteosarcomas, chondrosarcomas, and lymphomas also express NG2 (18Schrappe M. Klier F.G. Spiro R.C. Walz T.A. Reisfeld R.A. Gladson C.L. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 4986-4993PubMed Google Scholar, 19Real F.X. Houghton A.N. Albino A.P. Cordon-Cardo C. Melamed M.R. Oettgen H.F. Old L.J.

Smith F.O. Raimondi S.C. Pui C.H. Bernstein I.D. Blood. 1996; 87: 1134-1139Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). NG2 thus appears to be a developmental marker that is expressed at high levels on mitotic cells but is down-regulated during terminal differentiation. Developmental studies in the central nervous system have shown that there is a close relationship between the expression of NG2 and PDGF-α receptor on oligodendrocyte progenitors (15Nishiyama A. Lin X.H. Giese N. Heldin C.H. Stallcup W.B. J. Neurosci. Res. 1996; 43: 299-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar). Moreover, antibodies against NG2 are capable of blocking the mitogenic effects of PDGF-AA on both oligodendrocyte progenitors and vascular smooth muscle cells, suggesting that NG2 is involved in some way in the operation of the PDGF-AA/PDGF-α receptor pathway (16Nishiyama A. Lin X.-H. Giese N. Heldin C.-H. Stallcup W.B. J. Neurosci. Res. 1996; 43: 315-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 17Grako K. Stallcup W.B. Exp. Cell Res. 1995; 221: 231-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Recently, direct comparisons of aortic smooth muscle cells from wild type and NG2 null mice have shown that the NG2-negative cells fail to respond to PDGF-AA in both proliferation and migration assays and that this lack of activity stems from failure of the PDGF-α receptor to be activated in the presence of PDGF-AA (22Grako K.A. Ochiya T. Barritt D. Nishiyama A. Stallcup W.B. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 905-915PubMed Google Scholar). In order to investigate the possibility that NG2 is involved in binding and presentation of PDGF-AA, we have studied the ability of NG2 to bind to a variety of different growth factors. Our laboratory has produced and purified several recombinant forms of NG2, including the entire 270-kDa extracellular domain (both with and without GAG chains) and several well defined fragments of this ectodomain. Use of these species has allowed us to determine both the binding specificity and affinity of NG2 for growth factors. Here we report that the NG2 core protein binds with high affinity to PDGF-AA and bFGF (FGF-2). In addition we show that the large ectodomain of NG2 appears to contain at least two binding sites for each of these growth factors. These findings provide a molecular basis for understanding the role of NG2 in PDGF-α receptor activation and suggest that similar effects may be found for FGF receptors. Goat polyclonal antibodies against human bFGF, EGF, PDGF-AA, PDGF-BB, TGF-β1, and VEGF165 were purchased from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). Rabbit polyclonal antibodies against rat NG2 were affinity-purified from crude antisera using a matrix of recombinant NG2 fragments NG2/EC or NG2/D3 coupled to Sepharose CL-4B. Rabbit anti-goat IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (HRP) was obtained from Calbiochem. Peroxidase-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG was purchased from Bio-Rad. Expression and structural features of the recombinant NG2 fragments have been previously described (23Tillet E.F. Ruggiero A. Nishiyama A. Stallcup W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10769-10776Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Four different NG2 fragments were used in our experiments: NG2/EC (extracellular) without GAG chains, comprising the whole extracellular domain (residues 1–2223); NG2/EC with GAG chains; D2 (domain 2, residues 632–1450) and D3 (domain 3, residues 1587–2218). The D2 preparation used for our binding studies also contains GAG chains, while the D3 preparation does not. Recombinant human bFGF, EGF, PDGF-AA (long isoform), PDGF-BB, TGF-β1, and VEGF (long isoform) were purchased from R&D Systems. Research grade CM5 SensorChips (carboxymethylated dextran matrix), amine-coupling kit (N-ethyl-N′-(dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide/N-hydroxysuccinimide), and HBS buffer (10 mm Hepes with 0.15 m NaCl, 3.4 mm EDTA, and 0.005% surfactant P20 at pH 7.4) were all obtained from Pharmacia Biosensor AB (Uppsala, Sweden). Turbo TMB (3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine) was purchased from Pierce. A BIAcore 2000 surface plasmon resonance-based biosensor (Pharmacia Biosensor AB) was used to measure kinetic parameters for the interaction between soluble NG2 fragments (analytes) and immobilized growth factors (ligands). Growth factors were immobilized to the sensor chip surface by the amine-coupling method (24Jonsson U. Fagerstam L. Ivarsson B. Johnsson B. Karlsson R. Lundh K. Lofas S. Perrson B. Ross H. Ronnberg I. Sjolander S. Sternberg E. Dahlberg R. Urbaniczyky C. Ostlin H. Malmquist M. BioTechniques. 1991; 193: 620-627Google Scholar) according the manufacturer's suggestion. Each ligand was immobilized at a concentration of approximately 1500 resonance units (1.5 ng/mm2). The reverse design, immobilizing NG2 and injection of growth factors as soluble analytes, could not be utilized due to high nonspecific binding of the basic growth factor proteins to the unmodified chip surface. For all kinetic measurements, we used a flow path involving all four flow cells of the BIAcore 2000. Simultaneous measurements were obtained from one flow cell containing the growth factor-coated sensor chip and a second flow cell containing an underivatized chip. Parallel measurements of specific and background binding were thus obtained. The other two flow cells were not monitored. Solutions of NG2 fragments were injected into the flow cells using the KINJECT command specifying a 40-μl analyte volume and a 90-s dissociation time. Each assay cycle was performed with a constant flow of HBS at 20 μl/min. Between cycles, the immobilized ligands were regenerated by injecting 20 μl of 1 m NaCl and activating the EXTRACLEAN command. For each immobilized growth factor a complete set of sensorgrams was recorded at three to five different analyte concentrations in the range between 100 and 3,500 nm. This set of sensorgrams was analyzed using the BIAevaluation version 3.0 software. To prepare the data for analysis, baselines were adjusted to zero for all curves, and injection start times were aligned. Background sensorgrams were then subtracted from the experimental sensorgrams to yield curves representing specific binding. The association and dissociation phases of the sensorgrams were fit simultaneously, assuming a simple bimolecular reaction model: A + B ↔ AB. The analysis software corrects for the systematic upward drift of the base line that occurred during some measurements. Both an association rate constant k a(m−1 s−1) and a dissociation rate constant k d (s−1) were obtained for the entire data set (global fit), and the dissociation constant (K D = k d/k a) was derived from the two deduced rate constants. For the determination of k a only the middle portion of the association curve was used for fitting. For determination of k donly the initial portion of the curve encompassing the fast dissociation phase was used for fitting. All of our kinetic data were fit most adequately by assuming a simple bimolecular model for interaction between soluble analyte and immobilized ligand, equivalent to the Langmuir isotherm for adsorption to a surface. The goodness of fit was assessed by inspecting the statistical value χ2and the residuals (observed-calculated). The χ2 values were low (<5) and the residuals randomly distributed about zero. Fits were not improved by using a mass transport model or a two-state model (conformational change), except in the case of the interaction between bFGF and NG2/EC with GAG chains, which was best fit by the mass transport model. Enyzme-linked immunosorbent assays were used to evaluate the binding of growth factors to various NG2 fragments coated into microtiter wells. 96-well microtiter plates (Greiner, Nuertingen, Germany) were coated overnight at 4 °C with proteins at 3 μg/ml in 100 μl of coating buffer (50 mm sodium carbonate, pH 9.6). After washing twice with PBST (10 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, containing 2.7 mm KCl, 137 mm NaCl and 0.05% Tween 20), residual protein binding sites in the wells were saturated by incubating for 1 h at room temperature with 200 μl of blocking solution (PBS, 1% BSA). Growth factor samples diluted in PBS, 1% BSA were then incubated in the wells either at 4 °C overnight or for 2 h at room temperature. Both incubation protocols yielded similar results. After four washes with PBST, 100 μl of the growth factor-specific detection antibody (goat polyclonal antibody/2 μg/ml in PBS, 1% BSA) was allowed to incubate in the wells for 1.5 h at room temperature. After another round of washing, 100 μl of HRP-rabbit anti-goat IgG was added and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. Wells were then washed and bound HRP was detected by addition of 100 μl of TMB as a peroxidase substrate. The reaction was terminated after 10 min by addition of 50 μl of 0.5m H2SO4. The absorbance of the yellow reaction product was then measured at 450 nm on a Titertek microtiter plate reader. Wells were coated with 2 μg/ml growth factor. Binding of NG2 fragments to these immobilized growth factors was then determined as described above, with the following changes: polyclonal antibodies against NG2/EC or NG2/D3 were used as primary detection antibodies, and HRP-goat anti-rabbit IgG was used as the secondary antibody. Binding data from the solid-phase immunoassays were analyzed using PRISM software (GraphPad, San Diego, CA). Dissociation constants were determined by nonlinear regression analysis. A solid-phase assay was used to examine the binding potential of soluble growth factors to plastic-immobilized NG2 fragments representing the entire extracellular domain and the subdomains D2 and D3. PDGF-AA and bFGF bound strongly to each of these NG2 species in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig.1, A and B). In each case the levels of binding to BSA-coated wells were quite low. Nonlinear regression analysis yielded apparent dissociation constants (K D) between 5 and 15 nm for bFGF andK D values between 10 and 20 nm for PDGF-AA (Table I). bFGF has a somewhat higher affinity for NG2/EC with GAG chains than for NG2/EC without GAG chains, whereas PDGF-AA binds slightly better to the species without GAG chains.Table ISolid-phase binding dataD2D3EC with GAG chainsEC without GAG chainsnmnmbFGF9.8 ± 2.76.2 ± 1.45.2 ± 0.510.5 ± 3.4PDGF-AA13.2 ± 2.49.3 ± 1.015.3 ± 4.910.0 ± 3.5Dissociation constants (apparent K D values) for the interaction between plastic-immobilized NG2 fragments and bFGF or PDGF-AA were calculated by nonlinear regression analysis. Open table in a new tab Dissociation constants (apparent K D values) for the interaction between plastic-immobilized NG2 fragments and bFGF or PDGF-AA were calculated by nonlinear regression analysis. To further address the specificity of the interaction between bFGF or PDGF-AA and NG2, we asked whether the binding of these growth factors to immobilized NG2 could be blocked by increasing concentrations of soluble NG2. Fig. 2 shows that soluble D2 and D3 inhibited the binding of either bFGF or PDGF-AA to the respective NG2 subdomains in a concentration-dependent fashion. A 300-fold molar excess of soluble D2 or D3 almost completely blocked the respective interaction with bFGF or PDGF-AA. Neither EGF nor VEGF exhibited binding to any of the NG2 fragments that was significantly above the low background levels observed with BSA-coated wells, whereas PDGF-BB and TGF-β1 bound strongly to both NG2-coated wells and BSA-coated wells (data not shown). Although the binding of these two growth factors to NG2-coated wells often appeared to be slightly higher than that to BSA-coated wells, the extremely high background makes it difficult to draw definitive conclusions from these results. As an additional assessment of the specificity of growth factor binding to NG2, we examined the interactions in assays in which the roles of the binding partners were reversed: i.e. the growth factors were immobilized in plastic wells, and the coated wells were incubated with soluble NG2. Fig. 3 shows that when bFGF or PDGF-AA-coated wells were incubated with NG2/EC without GAGs or with NG2/D3 (inset of Fig. 3) at two different concentrations, each of these NG2 fragments bound effectively to both growth factors. Little background binding of NG2 species was observed to BSA-coated wells. This reversed assay also provided an opportunity to re-examine the interaction of NG2 with PDGF-BB and TGF-β1. As shown in Fig. 3, NG2/EC exhibited no significant binding to plastic-immobilized PDGF-BB or TGF-β1. Initial experiments indicated that injecting bFGF or PDGF-AA over a blank sensor chip yielded a high nonspecific binding response, probably due to electrostatic interaction of the cationic growth factors with the negatively charged carboxymethyl dextran layer on the chip surface. In contrast, injection of NG2 fragments over a blank chip surface resulted in a low nonspecific interaction (10–30 resonance units). We therefore restricted our studies to analysis of soluble NG2 fragments injected over growth factor-coated chips. As shown in Figs.4 and 5, sensorgrams obtained from injection of NG2 fragments onto surfaces coated with bFGF or PDGF-AA had good signal to noise ratios and exhibited concentration-dependent increases in both the rate and extent of binding. Bound NG2 could be eluted by injection of 1m NaCl, suggesting that ionic interactions play an important part in the association of NG2 with these growth factors. Curve fitting of the sensorgrams yielded on and off rates and apparent dissociation constants as presented in TableII. These values represent the mean of triplicate measurements made on the same sensor chip. TheK D values obtained from SPR measurements are in good agreement with those obtained from solid-phase assays (Table I).Figure 5Analysis of PDGF-AA and PDGF-BB binding to NG2 fragments by surface plasmon resonance. Sensorgrams are shown for different concentrations of NG2/D2, NG2/D3, NG2/EC minus GAGs, and NG2/EC plus GAGs injected on immobilized PDGF-AA. The analysis and regeneration was performed as described in the legend to Fig. 4, and calculated dissociation constants are listed in Table II.

Open table in a new tab Kinetic rate and dissociation constants for the interaction of NG2 fragments with immobilized bFGF or immobilized PDGF-AA were obtained by BIAcore analysis. These values represent the mean of triplicate measurements made on the same sensor chip. BIAcore analysis was also used to examine the interaction of soluble NG2 species with sensor chips coated with EGF, VEGF, PDGF-BB, and TGF-β1. In agreement with the results of the ELISA-type binding assays, none of the four NG2 fragments exhibited significant affinity for this set of growth factors. The inset of the NG2/EC− sensorgram in Fig. 5 shows an example of sensorgrams obtained for injection of different concentrations of NG2/EC without GAGs over a PDGF-BB-coated chip. The blank chip surface responses are subtracted. Injection of the other NG2 fragments over immobilized PDGF-BB also failed to yield positive signals (sensorgrams not shown). Several pieces of information obtained previously in our laboratory have suggested that NG2 plays an important role in cellular responsiveness to PDGF-AA. After noting the close co-localization of NG2 and PDGF-α receptor on oligodendrocyte progenitor cells during neural development (15Nishiyama A. Lin X.H. Giese N. Heldin C.H. Stallcup W.B. J. Neurosci. Res. 1996; 43: 299-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar), we found that antibodies against NG2 could block PDGF-induced proliferation of oligodendrocyte progenitorsin vitro (16Nishiyama A. Lin X.-H. Giese N. Heldin C.-H. Stallcup W.B. J. Neurosci. Res. 1996; 43: 315-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Extension of this work to rat aortic smooth muscle cells showed that these antibodies blocked both proliferation and migration in response to PDGF-AA (17Grako K. Stallcup W.B. Exp. Cell Res. 1995; 221: 231-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Responses to PDGF-BB were unaffected by the antibodies, specifically implicating NG2 in PDGF-AA-mediated activation of the α-receptor. Recent work with aortic smooth muscle cells from the NG2 knockout mouse has allowed us to confirm these findings independent of the use of antibodies. While smooth muscle cells from both wild type and NG2 knockout mice are able to proliferate and migrate in equivalent fashion in response to PDGF-BB, only the wild type cells are able to respond to PDGF-AA (22Grako K.A. Ochiya T. Barritt D. Nishiyama A. Stallcup W.B. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 905-915PubMed Google Scholar). More detailed analysis of growth factor-activated signaling pathways in the wild type and knockout cells showed that while PDGF-AA did not activate the MAP kinase pathway in knockout cells, the pathway was still fully operative in response to other effectors such as PDGF-BB and PMA. This suggested that the absence of NG2 probably affected a mechanism upstream of the MAP kinase pathway. In support of this idea we found that in NG2 null cells PDGF-AA was unable to induce autophosphorylation, and thus activation, of the PDGF-α receptor. We hypothesized that NG2 could affect α-receptor activation in one of two ways: 1) by participating in growth factor binding and/or presentation to the signaling receptor or 2) by interacting with the α-receptor in such a way as to facilitate either growth factor binding or growth factor-mediated changes in receptor structure (such as dimerization). While the findings presented in this report do not address the possibilities suggested by the second model, they nevertheless demonstrate a clear role for NG2 in the binding of two growth factors, PDGF-AA and bFGF, as suggested in model 1 above. The specificity of these interactions is emphasized by the failure of NG2 to bind several other growth factors, including PDGF-BB, TGF-β1, EGF, and VEGF. The absence of interaction between NG2 and PDGF-BB is consistent with the observed lack of effect of NG2 on cellular responses to this growth factor. The pattern and specificity of growth factor binding to NG2 was confirmed using two separate experimental systems, a solid-phase ELISA-type assay and an optical biosensor assay. In addition to demonstrating that NG2 binds to a limited spectrum of growth factors, the two types of assays also yielded essentially identical values for the binding affinity of PDGF-AA and bFGF to NG2. In some cases the apparent dissociation constants obtained from surface plasmon resonance measurements are approximately 2–4-fold higher than the corresponding values obtained from solid-phase assays. Presumably these differences are due to differences in the nature of the two assays. SPR measures the interactions directly in real time, while the solid-phase assays are lengthy and require the use of antibodies for indirect detection of the interaction. Also, differences between the electrostatic environments of the plastic wells and dextran-coated sensor chips may cause changes in the detailed conformation of adsorbed proteins, resulting in slight differences in ligand binding properties on the two sets of surfaces. Still, the two sets of values are in good agreement, and both sets reflect the same types of trends in the binding data. For example, in both sets of data bFGF displays a higher affinity for NG2/EC with GAG chains than for the same fragment without GAG chains. PDGF-AA, on the other hand, appears to bind slightly better in both assays to NG2 without GAG chains. These latter observations may be indicative of subtle differences in the mechanism of binding of the two growth factors to NG2. It is known that negatively charged heparan sulfate chains are critical for the binding of bFGF to heparan sulfate proteoglycans, so interaction of bFGF with chondroitin sulfate chains may also contribute to the binding of bFGF to NG2. This interaction may be responsible for the very large plasmon resonance response of bFGF-coated chips exposed to soluble NG2 containing chondroitin sulfate chains (Fig. 4). While the binding affinities of NG2/EC+ and NG2/EC− differ by a factor of two in these experiments (Table II), the capacity of NG2/EC+ for binding bFGF appears to be 5–6-fold greater than that of NG2/EC−. A similar, although much smaller trend can be seen in the ELISA-type binding assays (Fig. 1 A). Whether electrostatic interactions between bFGF and the negatively charged chondroitin sulfate chains of NG2 are somehow magnified in the plasmon resonance experiments, and whether the large bFGF binding capacity of NG2 with chondroitin sulfate chains is preserved in a biological environment, are questions that remain"

We have isolated and characterized a cDNA clone that encodes a protein tightly bound on a small rubber particle. We named this protein small rubber particle protein (SRPP). Prior to this study, this protein was known as a latex allergen, and only its partial amino acid sequence was reported. Sequence analysis revealed that this protein is highly homologous to the rubber elongation factor and the Phaseolus vulgaris stress-related protein. Southern and Northern analyses indicate that the protein is encoded by a single gene and highly expressed in latex. An allergenicity test using the recombinant protein confirmed that the cloned cDNA encodes the known 24-kDa latex allergen. Neither ethylene stimulation nor wounding changed the transcript level of the SRPP gene in H. brasiliensis. Anin vitro rubber assay showed that the protein plays a positive role in rubber biosynthesis. Therefore, it is likely that SRPP is a part of the rubber biosynthesis machinery, if not the rubber polymerase, along with the rubber elongation factor.

Therefore, it is likely that SRPP is a part of the rubber biosynthesis machinery, if not the rubber polymerase, along with the rubber elongation factor. Rubber (cis-1,4-polyisoprene), an isoprenoid polymer with no known physiological function to the plant, is produced in about 2000 plant species with varying degrees of quality and quantity (1Backhaus R.A. Isr. J. Bot. 1985; 34: 283-293Google Scholar). Rubber is the raw material of choice for heavy duty tires and other industrial uses requiring elasticity, flexibility, and resilience.Hevea brasiliensis has been the only commercial source of natural rubber mainly because of its abundance in the tree, its quality, and the ease of harvesting. The diminishing acreage of rubber plantations and life-threatening latex allergy to Hevearubber, coupled with an increasing demand, have prompted research interests in the study of rubber biosynthesis and the development of alternative rubber sources. In H. brasiliensis, rubber synthesis takes place on the surface of rubber particles suspended in the latex (the cytoplasm of laticifers). The laticifers are specialized vessels that are located adjacent to the phloem of the rubber tree. When severed during tapping, the high turgor pressure inside the laticifers expels latex containing 30–50% (w/w) cis-1,4-polyisoprene. The latex can be fractionated by centrifugation into three phases: the top fraction containing mostly rubber particles, the metabolically active middle fraction (called C-serum), and the bottom fraction of mainly vacuole-like organelles called lutoids.

Most of the experiments showing in vitrorubber synthesis with labeled isopentenyl pyrophosphate (IPP) have always required rubber particles. Dennis and Light (3Dennis M.S. Light D.R. J. Biol.

A United States patent (No. 5,633,433) claims that this protein is necessary for rubber biosynthesis. In light of these observations, it is plausible that the surface of the rubber particle is the appropriate location for a rubber transferase, which polymerizes a hydrophobic polymer into the particle interior while obtaining hydrophilic substrates, like IPP, from the cytosol. As major RPPs, both REF and Hev b 3 could well be the integral components of the rubber biosynthesis machinery. We are interested in understanding the molecular and biological aspects of rubber biosynthesis. In a separate study to investigate the gene expression profile in the rubber-producing tissue, we generated a number of ESTs from latex. One of the genes most abundantly expressed in latex was found to be a cDNA clone encoding a major rubber particle protein, Hev b 3. This protein causes allergenic response in spina bifida patients, and only its partial amino acid sequence was determined (13Yeang H.Y. Cheong K.F. Sunderasan E. Hamzah S. Chew N.P. Hamid S. Hamilton R.G. Cardosa M.J. J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 1996; 98: 628-639Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 18Yeang H.Y. Ward M.A. Zamri A.S.M. Dennis M.S. Light D.R. Allergy. 1998; 53: 513-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The gene encoding this protein has not been cloned. In this study, we isolated and characterized a full-length cDNA encoding the allergen Hev b 3. We named the gene small rubber particle protein (SRPP) for a common name. The amino acid sequence of SRPP is highly homologous to that of REF, suggesting its potential involvement in rubber biosynthesis. However, there has been no experimental evidence for the function of SRPP. SRPP has also high sequence homology to Phaseolus vulgaris stress-related protein (PvSRP) that was reported in the data base entry to be induced by heavy metals, wounding, and virus infection. The present study shows that SRPP is not induced by wounding or ethylene but plays a positive role in rubber biosynthesis. Latex and leaf samples were obtained from mature rubber plants (H. brasiliensisclone RRIM 600) growing at the Rubber Research Institute of Malaysia (RRIM), Selangor, Malaysia. Latex collection and RNA extraction from the latex were performed as described in Kush et al. (2Kush A. Goyvaerts E. Chye M.L. Chua N.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 1787-1790Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) using the Qiagen Rneasy Plant Minikit (Qiagen Inc., Chatsworth, CA). Poly(A)+ RNA was isolated using Oligotex-dTTMmRNA kit (Qiagen Inc.). For the effect of wounding, five H. brasiliensis (clone RRIM 600) trees were wounded with six nails above and along the slope of the tapping cut while another five control trees were not punctured. Latex and leaf samples were collected from each tree about 16 h after puncturing. For the effect of ethylene stimulation, five H. brasiliensis (clone RRIM 600) trees were stimulated with an ethylene-releasing agent (ethephon, 2.5%, v/v) while five control trees were not. Latex and leaf samples were collected from each tree 2 days after stimulation. First strand cDNA synthesis was performed by reverse transcribing 0.5 μg of total latex RNA using a modified oligo-dT primer, T25NN (5′-GGAGAAGGA(T)25(A/G/C)N-3′). For PCR, 10 μl of the first strand cDNA synthesis was used to amplify part of the coding sequence for SRPP. A degenerate primer, BW1, was designed according to sequence similarities between Hev b 1 (commonly known as REF) and previously published peptide fragments of Hev b 3 (13Yeang H.Y. Cheong K.F. Sunderasan E. Hamzah S. Chew N.P. Hamid S. Hamilton R.G. Cardosa M.J. J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 1996; 98: 628-639Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). The peptide sequence KYLDFV was chosen (see Fig. 1, underlined). The primers used to amplify a fragment of the SRPP (Hev b 3) cDNA were BW1 (5′-AAGCTTAA(A/G)TA(C/T)TIGA(C/T)TT(C/T)GT-3′, where I stands for inosine) and T25NN. The PCR product was excised from an agarose gel and purified with the QIAEX II agarose gel extraction kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Purified PCR products were ligated into the pCRTM 2.1 vector (TA cloning kit, Invitrogen, NV Leek, Netherlands). Plasmids of transformed Escherichia colistrain XL1-Blue were isolated and sequenced by the dideoxyribonucleotide chain termination method using the Thermo Sequenase fluorescent labeled primer cycle sequencing kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). To complete the missing 5′-portion of the cDNA, the 5′-AmpliFINDERTM RACE kit (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) was used according to the vendor's instructions. cDNA synthesis was performed with the T25NN primer and PCR after anchor ligation with the kit's AmpliFINDER anchor primer and the gene-specific internal primer BW4 (5′-AGGTAATGACCGCATATTGCTCAGC-3′). The complete cDNA sequence of SRPP cloned by this method is available from the GenBankTM/EBI data base under accession numberAJ223388. A cDNA library was constructed in a Uni-ZAP II vector according to the supplier's instructions (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) using poly(A)+ RNA prepared from latex. In a separate study using a subtracted cDNA library (latex − leaf), we identified an EST whose deduced amino acid sequence matched with the known partial sequence of Hev b 3.2 From the sequence information of the EST clone, we designed a PCR primer corresponding to the sequences from +185 to +211 bp in SRPP (see Fig. 1). This primer (upstream) and T7 primer (downstream) were used to amplify SRPP from the latex cDNA library. PCR was performed for 30 cycles of 30 s at 94 °C, 30 s at 50 °C, and 2 min at 72 °C, with a 5-min preheat and a 10-min final extension at 72 °C. The PCR product was used to screen 5 × 105 plaques of the latex cDNA library. The cDNA clones hybridized to the probe were subjected to in vivo excision according to the protocol provided by the cDNA library kit and sequenced. One clone carrying a full-length cDNA insert was designated as pSRPP and chosen for further study. Plasmid DNA for sequencing reactions was prepared by the alkaline lysis method (20Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning. A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 1.21-1.41Google Scholar) using WizardTM Plus SV Minipreps DNA purification system kit (Promega). The sequencing reaction was performed with the ALFexpress AutoRead sequencing kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using the fluorescent dye-labeled M13 universal or reverse primer (provided by the kit). The nucleotide sequences were obtained by electrophoresis on an ALF automatic sequencer (Perkin Elmer Corp.). The SRPP gene was cloned either in the EcoRI-XhoI site of pGEX (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) or in theBamHI-PvuII site of pRSET (Invitrogen) to construct pGEX-SRPP or pRSET-SRPP. The E. coli XL1-Blue transformed with either pGEX-SRPP or pRSET-SRPP was grown to midstationary phase in Luria broth (LB) containing 50 mg/liter ampicillin at 30 °C with vigorous aeration. The cultures were induced by adding IPTG to a concentration of 0.1 mm and then incubated for another 6 h. All subsequent steps were carried out at 4 °C. The cells were harvested, washed with 0.1 mpotassium phosphate (pH 7.4) by centrifugation (5000 × g, 10 min), and then disrupted by sonication. The homogenate was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min, and the supernatant was used to determine rubber synthesis activity. The lysate was subjected to SDS-PAGE according to the standard method of Laemmli (21Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 277: 680-685Crossref Scopus (207211) Google Scholar). Genomic DNA from leaf tissues of a mature H. brasiliensis RRIM 500 was prepared, digested, and blotted as described in Han et al. (22Han K.-H. Gordon M.P. Strauss S.H. Can. J. For. Res. 1997; 27: 464-470Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar). For Northern blot, total RNA was electrophoresed on a 1.4% agarose-formaldehyde gel and blotted as for Southern blot. A32P-labeled 175-bp fragment (from 480 to 655 bp in Fig. 1) from SRPP cDNA was used as a probe. The hybridization was performed with high stringency (22Han K.-H. Gordon M.P. Strauss S.H. Can. J. For. Res. 1997; 27: 464-470Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Washed rubber particles (WRP) were prepared by a repeated centrifugation/flotation procedure as described (23Cornish K. Backhaus R.A. Phytochemistry. 1990; 29: 3809-3813Crossref Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 24Siler D.J. Cornish K. Phytochemistry. 1993; 32: 1097-1102Crossref Scopus (54) Google Scholar). C-serum or WRP was incubated in 50 μl of reaction mixture containing 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 80 μm [14C]IPP (55 mCi mmol−1, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), 20 μm FPP, 1 mmMgSO4, and 1 mm dithiothreitol for 6 h at 25 °C. For control experiments, 25 mm EDTA was added to the reaction mixture to chelate Mg2+ ion necessary for rubber transferase activity. The reaction was stopped by adding 25 mm EDTA. The resulting [14C]IPP-incorporated rubber was quantified by using either a filtration or a benzene extraction method. For the filtration method, the reaction mixture was filtered through either 0.02 or 0.1 μm anodisc membrane (Whatman). The filter was subjected to repeated washing with 1m HCl and 95% ethanol (23Cornish K. Backhaus R.A. Phytochemistry. 1990; 29: 3809-3813Crossref Scopus (101) Google Scholar), and the remaining radioactivity on the washed filters was determined by a liquid scintillation counter (Beckman). For the benzene extraction method, the reaction mixture was extracted three times with 2 volumes of benzene. The benzene extract was mixed with a Ready Solv HP scintillation mixture (Beckman), and the radioactivity was determined by a liquid scintillation counter. To inhibit IgE specific to SRPP in the serum, 170 μl of native SRPP (100 μg ml−1) was added to a mixture containing 0.35 ml of patient serum, 1.3 ml of 5% nonfat milk in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and 90 μl of 1% sodium azide. A sample of uninhibited patient serum was similarly treated, but SRPP was replaced with water. The serum samples were incubated overnight at 7 °C. Native and recombinant SRPP proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE on 15% gels (21Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 277: 680-685Crossref Scopus (207211) Google Scholar). The gels were subsequently stained with Coomassie Blue or used for Western blotting where the proteins in the gel were transferred electrophoretically to a nitrocellulose membrane. To detect allergen-IgE binding, the nitrocellulose membrane was blocked with PBS-milk and then incubated overnight with patient serum inhibited or not inhibited with SRPP as described above. After three cycles of washing with PBS-milk, the nitrocellulose membrane was incubated for 1 h with anti-IgE antiserum conjugated to alkaline phosphatase. After a further three cycles of washing with PBS-milk, the nitrocellulose membrane was incubated for 10 min in Tris-buffered saline before being immersed in 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate/nitro blue tetrazolium substrate to generate the colored alkaline phosphatase reaction product. Two approaches, RT-PCR amplification and cDNA library screening, were employed to clone the gene. Sequence analysis showed that the genes isolated by the two different methods were identical except for minor differences in the untranslated regions (UTRs). The RT-PCR-amplified gene has an additional 21 bp (ATAATCAGTTGATAGCTTCCA) before nucleotide 1 at the 5′-UTR, whereas the cDNA library-derived gene has an additional 9 bp before the poly(A) tail. The primary latex cDNA library used for screening contained 5 × 107 recombinant phages. Using the PCR-generated SRPP sequences, 10 positive clones with cDNA inserts (0.8–1.0 kb) were detected and isolated from 5 × 105 plaques of the cDNA library. A cDNA clone containing an insert of approximately 1.0 kb in size was selected and subjected to in vivo excision for further study. The resulting phagemid was designated pSRPP. Sequence analysis showed that the cDNA insert was 910 bp long (Fig. 1) and contained a 612-bp open reading frame flanked by a 63-bp 5′-UTR and a 181-bp 3′-UTR including a poly(A) tail of 18 bp. A putative polyadenylation signal (AATAAA) beginning at bp 794 was identified. The open reading frame encodes for a 204-amino acid polypeptide with a predicted molecular mass of 22.4 kDa. The deduced protein is acidic with an isoelectric point of 4.8, which is similar to that of REF (pI = 5.04). Hydropathy analysis of the deduced amino acid sequence showed that SRPP is hydrophobic (Fig. 2). Transmembrane region analysis using the TMpred algorithm indicated that the SRPP does not have transmembrane helices large enough to span the lipid bilayers. A computer analysis using the PSORT program (K. Nakai, Osaka University, Japan) for protein localization sites suggested that SRPP is localized in cytoplasm. The predicted amino acid sequence of the SRPP has high similarity to those of REF (72% in the paired sequence region), PvSRP (68%), andArabidopsis thaliana F1N21.4 (48%). PvSRP is believed to be involved in the defense mechanism and induced by stress or wounding. The function of the Arabidopsis gene F1N21.4 is not known. Sequence alignment indicated that there is a highly conserved region from amino acids 38 to 65 with no match to any known functional domains (Fig. 3). To determine the copy number of the SRPP gene, Southern blot hybridization analysis was performed using a random primed 175-bp fragment (Fig. 1, from 480 to 655 bp) from SRPP cDNA as a hybridization probe. This sequence is the least homologous region in the sequence alignment with other related genes (Fig. 3). A single hybridizing band was observed in each restriction digest (Fig. 4), suggesting that SRPP is most likely encoded by a single gene per haploid genome. However, when the entire SRPP cDNA sequence was used as a probe, four bands were detectable on the blot (data not shown). To confirm that the cDNA we cloned encodes for the previously known 24-kDa protein (Hev b 3), immunoblot analyses of natural and recombinant SRPP were performed with antisera from spina bifida patients. This 24-kDa protein is known to be tightly associated with the small rubber particle where rubber synthesis is actively occurring. Natural and recombinant SRPP proteins were equivalent in their ability to bind IgE (Fig.5). The IgE reactivity to both natural and recombinant SRPP proteins could be equally inhibited by preincubation of the sera with native SRPP protein. Northern blot analysis showed a single band of 1.0 kb for SRPP from both leaf and latex samples. The level of transcripts was most abundant in latex (Fig.6). The expression of SRPP in responses to wounding and ethylene stimulation was investigated at both transcription and translation levels. We found that neither wounding nor ethephon treatment changed the expression of SRPP at both transcriptional (Fig. 6) and translational levels (data not shown). This result suggested that the function of this rubber particle-associated protein is likely in areas other than defense. To determine whether SRPP is involved in rubber biosynthesis, in vitro rubber biosynthesis assays using Hevea C-serum and WRP were performed by adding SRPP protein to the reaction mixture. SRPP was expressed in E. coli as a glutathioneS-transferase (GST)-SRPP fusion protein under the control of the IPTG-inducible tac promoter (Fig.7). The bacterial extracts of the culture after IPTG induction were used as a source of SRPP recombinant protein. As a control, either the same bacterial extract without IPTG induction or the culture of E. coli harboring pGEX vector with no insert was used. Both C-serum and WRP per se contain native SRPP as well as REF and exhibited a fairly high level of rubber biosynthetic activity (about 8,000 cpm) compared with control reaction (about 900 cpm) (Fig. 8). Rubber transferase in the control was inactivated by the addition of 25 mm EDTA that chelates Mg2+ ion necessary for the activity of the enzyme. As shown in Fig. 8, the amounts of [14C]IPP incorporated into rubber were substantially increased with the addition of recombinant SRPP. The increase of [14C]IPP incorporation was dependent upon the amounts of SRPP protein added to the reaction mixture. [14C]IPP incorporation was increased about 4-fold by the addition of 15 μl of bacterial extract expressing GST-SRPP fusion protein to the reaction mixture containing either 5 μl of C-serum or 10 mg of WRP. In contrast, no increase of [14C]IPP incorporation was observed in the control reaction containing bacterial extracts from either the culture without IPTG induction or the culture expressing only the GST protein.Figure 8SRPP plays a positive role in rubber biosynthesis in vitro. a,[14C]IPP incorporation into rubber as a function of SRPP concentration. The rubber elongation assay was performed in 50 μl of reaction mixture containing 10 mg of WRP and the indicated amounts of SRPP. Each value is the mean of three experiments for bacterial extracts of the cells expressing GST-SRPP fusion protein with IPTG induction (▪), bacterial extracts without IPTG induction (♦), and bacterial extracts of the cells expressing only the GST protein (▴).b, concentration dependence of antibody-SRPP inhibition of rubber biosynthesis. The indicated amounts of antibody raised against SRPP were added to 50 μl of reaction mixture containing 5 μl of C-serum. Each value is the mean of three experiments for control rabbit (♦) and mouse (●) serum without antibody formation, monoclonal antibody (▴), and polyclonal antibody (▪).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To further confirm that SRPP plays a role in rubber biosynthesis, polyclonal antibodies from SRPP-challenged rabbit serum and monoclonal antibodies from mouse were prepared (13Yeang H.Y. Cheong K.F. Sunderasan E. Hamzah S. Chew N.P. Hamid S. Hamilton R.G. Cardosa M.J. J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 1996; 98: 628-639Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), and their ability to inhibit rubber biosynthesis in C-serum was tested. The untreated blood serum and the culture supernatant were used as a control without further purification. Fig. 8 shows that the polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies generated against SRPP protein inhibited rubber biosynthesis to a much greater extent than the control serum. At higher concentrations of the control serum, some inhibition of rubber biosynthesis was observed. A more severe reduction in rubber biosynthesis was observed with polyclonal antibodies than with monoclonal antibodies. This differential inhibitory effect could be because of the immuno-cross-reactivity of the polyclonal antibody with REF (data not shown) because of the high sequence homology to SRPP (Fig. 3). It is also possible that the polyclonal antibody binds to both SRPP and REF, and possibly to other proteins with sequence homology with SRPP, and inhibits rubber biosynthesis to a greater extent than monoclonal antibody that binds to only SRPP. These results suggest that SRPP is involved in rubber biosynthesis in vitro. We tested whether SRPP can catalyze the successive condensing reactions of IPP to the rubber-initiating molecule FPP without the presence of WRP. The in vitro rubber assay was carried out with or without the addition of WRP using bacterial extracts of the cells expressing only GST protein, bacterial extracts without IPTG induction, and bacterial extracts of the cells expressing GST-SRPP fusion protein with IPTG induction. The reaction products of the rubber assay were analyzed by reverse phase TLC. The radiolabeled products synthesized by WRP were retained at the origin, indicating long-chain length rubber (Fig. 9). Without the presence of WRP, reactions with GST protein alone or uninduced extracts showed no detectable IPP incorporation activity (Fig. 9, lanes a and b). Only the reaction with the bacterial extracts of cells expressing GST-SRPP fusion protein produced polyisoprene (lane c). Most of the reaction products synthesized by GST-SRPP fusion protein were retained at the origin, but a distribution of weak bands migrating with the solvent was detected above the origin (lane c). These results suggest that the reaction products synthesized by GST-SRPP fusion protein are mainly a mixture of long-chain length polymers. We are currently examining the nature of these long-chain length polymers. Because rubber biosynthesis takes place in laticifers, genes highly expressed in such tissues may code for the enzymes involved in rubber synthesis. Kush et al. (2Kush A. Goyvaerts E. Chye M.L. Chua N.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 1787-1790Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) reported a number of genes highly expressed in latex compared with leaves. They found that latex RNAs are highly enriched in transcripts encoding rubber biosynthesis-related enzymes (20–100-fold) as well as defense-related proteins (10–50-fold). In a separate study we have identified about 245 ESTs from the latex cDNA library.2 Rubber biosynthesis-related genes (e.g. REF and SRPP) along with defense genes are among the most abundant transcripts. The latex has been suggested to play some protective roles because of the high concentration of defense-related proteins in latex (26John P. John P. Biosynthesis of the Major Crop Products. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1993: 114-126Google Scholar). However, it remains to be answered why Hevea species allocate excessive energy and resource to rubber synthesis. Rubber particles of H. brasiliensis latex can be separated by ultracentrifugation into two distinct fractions: Zone 1 fraction (large rubber particles) and Zone 2 fraction (small rubber particles). The size of rubber particles ranges from about 10 μm to below 0.2 μm (27Siler D.J. Goodrich-Tanrikulu M. Cornish K. Stafford A.E. McKeon T.A. Plant Physiol. Biochem. 1997; 35: 881-889Google Scholar, 28Yeang H.Y. Yip E. Hamzah S. J. Nat. Rubber Res. 1995; 10: 108-123Google Scholar). Each rubber particle contains hundreds to thousands of rubber molecules within this enclosing interface (25.Deleted in proof.Google Scholar). Analysis using gel permeation chromatography revealed that the small rubber particles contained rubber of higher molecular weight than the large rubber particles. Rubber particles are not simply an inert ball of rubber. Siler et al. (27Siler D.J. Goodrich-Tanrikulu M. Cornish K. Stafford A.E. McKeon T.A. Plant Physiol. Biochem. 1997; 35: 881-889Google Scholar) analyzed the composition of rubber particles of four rubber-producing plants including H. brasiliensis and suggested that the rubber particle surface is a mosaic of protein, conventional membrane lipids, and other components. Among many latex proteins, two main proteins remain associated with rubber particles after repeated washing: REF (14 kDa) with large rubber particles and SRPP (23 kDa) with small rubber particles (13Yeang H.Y.

Rubber transferase (cis-prenyltransferase) activity has been reported from the rubber particle-bound proteins of three rubber-producing plants, H. brasiliensis (17Lynen F. J. Rubber Res. Inst. Malays. 1969; 21: 389-406Google Scholar, 29Archer B.L. Audley B.G. Cockbain E.G. McSweeney G.P. Biochem. J. 1963; 89: 565-574Crossref PubMed Google Scholar),Parthenium argentatum (23Cornish K.

Although at least two rubber particle-associated proteins, a REF and a rubber transferase, have been suggested to be involved in rubber biosynthesis in H. brasiliensis (3Dennis M.S. Light D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 18608-18617Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Light D.R. Lazarus R.A. Dennis M.S. J. Biol.

Biochem. 1993; 218: 267-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), the detailed mechanism of rubber biosynthesis has not been investigated. Although the gene coding for rubber transferase has not been cloned, a full-length cDNA encoding REF has been cloned (4Goyvaerts E. Dennis M. Light D. Chua N.H. Plant Physiol. 1991; 97: 317-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). It has been established that REF plays a functional role in rubber polymerization (3Dennis M.S. Light D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 18608-18617Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Light D.R. Lazarus R.A. Dennis M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 18598-18607Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the actual role of REF and the nature of rubber transferase in cis-1,4-polyisoprene elongation has not been fully assessed. It is possible that SRPP is involved in rubber biosynthesis, as the rubber particle is the site of rubber synthesis and SRPP is one of the two major RPPs. In the current study, we established that SRPP has high amino acid sequence homology to REF and plays a positive role in rubber synthesis. Furthermore, we showed that SRPP synthesized long-chain polyisoprene without other rubber particle proteins (Fig. 9, lane c). These findings, along with the fact that SRPP is tightly associated with small rubber particles and is abundantly expressed in latex, suggest that SRPP plays a similar role in rubber synthesis as REF does and could potentially be a rubber transferase. In addition to the postulated role in rubber biosynthesis, its high sequence homology to PvSRP suggests that SRPP is involved in defense mechanism. PvSRP is believed to play a role in plant defense mechanism and is regulated by heavy metal stress, wounding, and virus infection. We tested to see if SRPP is induced by ethephon treatment or wounding. Ethylene regulates fruit ripening, germination, senescence, and the expression of the response to environmental stresses such as mechanical wounding, infection, and waterlogging (33Abeles F.B. Morgan P.W. Saltveit M.E. Ethylene in Plant Biology. 2nd Ed. Academic Press, New York1992Google Scholar) by stimulating changes in gene expression. Ethephon treatment increased (approximately 5–20 times) several defense genes including chitinase, pathogenesis-regulated protein, and phenylalanine ammonia-lyase inH. brasiliensis (2Kush A. Goyvaerts E. Chye M.L. Chua N.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 1787-1790Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Northern blot analyses indicated that the SRPP gene is not induced by wounding or ethephon treatment. These results showed that the expression pattern of the gene is different from the kidney bean stress-related protein (PvSRP). Furthermore, the calculated isoelectric point of SRPP (pI = 4.8) was quite different from that of PvSRP (pI = 9.47), suggesting that SRPP is biochemically distinct from PvSRP. These findings indicate that the function of this rubber particle-associated protein is likely in areas other than defense. Although the biological significance of rubber to the producing plant is not obvious, natural rubber is of great commercial importance. Elucidation of a mechanism for rubber biosynthesis may provide crucial knowledge bases for genetic manipulation of the Hevea rubber tree to improve rubber productivity and quality and to aid the development of alternative rubber crops by transgenic expression of the gene(s) responsible for rubber formation. The present study identified SRPP as a potential candidate for rubber transferase. Although SRPP seems to catalyze the formation of long-chain length rubber, it remains to be determined whether SRPP plays a direct role in elongating the rubber chain or contributes indirectly by synthesizing the initiating molecules necessary for rubber biosynthesis. More biochemical studies with the purified SRPP are required to further characterize the exact nature of the involvement of this protein in rubber biosynthesis. Unfortunately, the E. coli expression system we used in the present study produced most of the fusion protein in insoluble form. We therefore are attempting to obtain large quantities of soluble protein using either Pichia or baculovirus expression systems. Furthermore, we are currently investigating the possible role of SRPP as a rubber transferase in transgenic plants expressing SRPP and REF. We thank Drs. Pill-Soon Song, Jeong Mook Kim, and Eric Johnson for their critical reading of the manuscript and Min Yung Kang, In Jeong Kim, Jin Sook Kim, and Ji Yeon Lee for technical assistance.

https://openalex.org/W2039426864,"Targeting of mouse alcohol dehydrogenase genes Adh1, Adh3, and Adh4 resulted in null mutant mice that all developed and reproduced apparently normally but differed markedly in clearance of ethanol and formaldehyde plus metabolism of retinol to the signaling molecule retinoic acid. Following administration of an intoxicating dose of ethanol, Adh1 -/- mice, and to a lesser extent Adh4 -/- mice, but not Adh3 -/- mice, displayed significant reductions in blood ethanol clearance. Ethanol-induced sleep was significantly longer only in Adh1 -/- mice. The incidence of embryonic resorption following ethanol administration was increased 3-fold in Adh1 -/- mice and 1.5-fold in Adh4 -/- mice but was unchanged in Adh3 -/- mice. Formaldehyde toxicity studies revealed that only Adh3 -/- mice had a significantly reduced LD50 value. Retinoic acid production following retinol administration was reduced 4.8-fold in Adh1 -/- mice and 8.5-fold in Adh4 -/- mice. Thus, Adh1 and Adh4 demonstrate overlapping functions in ethanol and retinol metabolism in vivo, whereas Adh3 plays no role with these substrates but instead functions in formaldehyde metabolism. Redundant roles for Adh1 and Adh4 in retinoic acid production may explain the apparent normal development of mutant mice."

Infection of viral, bacterial, or protozoan intracellular pathogens often involves subversion of mammalian signaling pathways. The first step in the life cycle of an intracellular pathogen is internalization by the host cell. While some microbial pathogens are taken up only by professional phagocytes (macrophages or neutrophils), others induce their own uptake (“enter”) into cells that are not normally phagocytic, such as epithelial cells underlying mucosal surfaces or endothelial cells inside blood vessels (reviewed in Ref.1Finlay B.B. Falkow S. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1997; 61: 136-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (1162) Google Scholar). Entry into non-phagocytic cells can permit traversal of tissue-specific barriers and promote survival of the pathogen by providing access to a nutrient-rich environment that is protected from host antibody or complement.Listeria monocytogenes is a food-borne bacterial pathogen that causes severe illnesses leading to meningitis or abortions in immunocompromised individuals or pregnant women (2Schlech III, W.F.

Entry into such cells is likely to play an important role in traversing the intestinal, blood-brain, and placental barriers, and in colonization of the liver (reviewed in Ref. 3Ireton K. Cossart P.

Activation of p85-p110 is required for bacterial uptake, since entry is blocked by genetic or pharmacological inhibition of p85-p110. Bacterial stimulation of PI 3-kinase is accompanied by interaction of p85 with one or more tyrosine phosphorylated host proteins, indicating that tyrosine phosphorylation is involved in signaling mediated by p85-p110. The specific phosphoproteins that associate with p85 have not been identified.p85-p110 is a heterodimeric lipid kinase, composed of an 85-kDa regulatory subunit and a 110-kDa catalytic subunit, which is activated in response to engagement of cell surface receptors by some growth factors or cytokines. Activation of p85-p110 is often promoted by recruitment to the plasma membrane through interaction of SH2 domains in p85 with tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins (10Kapeller R. Cantley L.C. Bioessays. 1994; 16: 565-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar). Activation of p85-p110 and some other PI 3-kinases in vivo is characterized by rapid and often transient increases in levels of PtdIns(3,4)P2 and PtdIns(3,4,5)P3, phosphoinositides that appear to act as membrane-bound second messengers to regulate the cellular localization and/or activity of various signaling proteins (11Toker A. Cantley L.G. Nature. 1997; 387: 673-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (1218) Google Scholar). p85-p110 controls several critical processes in mammalian cells, including cell growth, vesicular trafficking, apoptosis, and organization of cytoskeletal actin. Although the function of p85-p110 in entry of L. monocytogenes is not understood, an attractive possibility is that this kinase controls cytoskeletal changes needed for bacterial uptake.In this report, we identify one of the bacterial factors that activates PI 3-kinase in mammalian cells. A recombinant InlB protein stimulated accumulation of the lipid products of p85-p110, tyrosine phosphorylation of three mammalian adaptor proteins, and the association of these adaptor proteins with p85. InlB also provoked PI 3-kinase-dependent membrane ruffling. These findings establish InlB as the first reported non-mammalian agonist of p85-p110 and suggest similarities between signal transduction promoted by this bacterial protein and some mammalian growth factors.DISCUSSIONOur results establish that the L. monocytogenes protein InlB is an agonist of mammalian p85-p110. To our knowledge, InlB is the first reported non-mammalian polypeptide activator of this PI 3-kinase, which is known to be regulated by several growth factors or hormones, including insulin, plateletderived growth factor,N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine, thrombin, and EGF. InlB-mediated activation of p85-p110 has features in common with that promoted by these known agonists. Like EGF and insulin, InlB affects p85-p110 in part through tyrosine phosphorylation of adaptor proteins and interaction of these proteins with p85. In fact, InlB regulates phosphorylation of some of the same adaptor proteins utilized by EGF and insulin, including Gab1, Cbl, and Shc (17Soltoff S.P. Cantley L.C. J. Biol.

InlB also resembles these growth factors in its ability to stimulate membrane ruffling through p85-p110.It is clear that InlB is not the only L. monocytogenesfactor that regulates mammalian PI 3-kinase activity. Infection of Vero cells with the ΔinlB mutant results in approximately 30% of the increase in cellular PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 that normally occurs upon infection with wt L. monocytogenes (6Ireton K. Payrastre B. Chap H. Ogawa W. Sakaue H. Kasuga M. Cossart P. Science. 1996; 274: 780-782Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Thus, the ΔinlB mutant is only partly defective in stimulating host PI 3-kinase activity. In this work, we show that the ΔinlB mutant is partly defective in inducing tyrosine phosphorylation of Gab1, but is still able to cause phosphorylation of the adaptors Cbl and Shc. It seems likely that this tyrosine phosphorylation of Cbl and Shc is responsible for the residual activation of p85-p110 caused by the ΔinlB strain. Although the bacterial factor responsible for residual stimulation of PI 3-kinase is not known, it appears to be relatively specific toL. monocytogenes. Infection with the non-pathogenicListeria species Listeria innocua did not result in tyrosine phosphorylation of Gab, Cbl, or Shc or interaction of these proteins with p85. The invasion protein InlA was not responsible for the tyrosine phosphorylation of Cbl and Shc caused by the ΔinlB mutant, since an L. monocytogenes mutant strain deleted for both the inlA and inlB genes (4Dramsi S. Biswas I. Maguin E. Braun L. Mastroeni P. Cossart P. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 16: 251-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar) was fully capable of inducing phosphorylation of these two adaptors.2 Further work is needed to identify the bacterial and mammalian components involved in the residual stimulation of PI 3-kinase.The sequence determinants in InlB that promote activation of p85-p110 and bacterial entry remain to be defined. InlB contains an NH2-terminal region with eight 22-amino acid repeats that are rich in leucine residues (4Dramsi S. Biswas I. Maguin E. Braun L. Mastroeni P. Cossart P. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 16: 251-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar, 13Gaillard J.L. Berche P. Frehel C. Gouin E. Cossart P.

Immun. 1997; 65: 1615-1625Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), making it a member of the functionally diverse leucine-rich repeat family of proteins (31Kajava A.V. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 277: 519-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). We are currently testing whether the leucine-rich repeat region of InlB is sufficient for activation of mammalian PI 3-kinase and bacterial uptake.The primary recognized function of InlB is in mediating entry ofL. monocytogenes into non-phagocytic mammalian cells (4Dramsi S. Biswas I. Maguin E. Braun L. Mastroeni P. Cossart P. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 16: 251-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar, 5Lingnau A. Domann E. Hudel M. Bock M. Nichterlein T. Wehland J.

Microbiol. 1998; 28: 81-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Our previous results indicated that InlB-mediated entry and activation of p85-p110 involve interaction of p85 with one or more unknown tyrosine-phosphorylated host protein(s) (6Ireton K. Payrastre B. Chap H. Ogawa W. Sakaue H. Kasuga M. Cossart P. Science. 1996; 274: 780-782Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). In this report, we identify Gab1, Cbl, and Shc as at least some of the phosphoproteins that are likely to be important for bacterial uptake mediated by PI 3-kinase. Gab1, Cbl, and Shc lack kinase or other known activities and are believed to act as cytosolic “adaptors” that couple p85-p110 and other signaling proteins to surface receptors engaged by a variety of cytokines or growth factors (35Pawson T. Scott J.D. Science. 1997; 278: 2075-2080Crossref PubMed Scopus (1887) Google Scholar). Of these three adaptors, Gab1 may play the most important role in signaling during InlB-mediated entry. The ΔinlB bacterial mutant, which is defective for entry into Vero cells, is also defective in promoting tyrosine phosphorylation of Gab1, but is still able to promote phosphorylation of Cbl and Shc. Although these results are consistent with the idea that a complex composed of phosphorylated Gab1 and p85 is needed for entry of L. monocytogenes, definitive evidence for the role of Gab1 or the other adaptor proteins will require genetic approaches that specifically interfere with the function of each individual protein.Formation of Gab·p85 and Cbl·p85 complexes in response to EGF or other agonists is driven by interaction of the SH2 domains in p85 with SH2-binding sites of the type YxxM present in Gab1 and Cbl (17Soltoff S.P. Cantley L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 563-567Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 22Holgado-Madruga M. Emlet D.R. Moscatello D.K. Godwin A.K. Wong A.J.

A. 1997; 94: 12419-12424Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). It seems likely that Gab1·p85 and Cbl·p85 complexes induced by InlB also involve such interactions. Shc lacks YxxM sites and is therefore unlikely to directly interact with the p85 SH2 domains. However, the formation of Shc·p85 complexes in response to InlB could involve interaction of Shc with a YxxM-containing protein that is itself associated with p85 (perhaps Gab1 or Cbl) and/or a previously described direct interaction between Shc and the p85 SH3 domain (37Harrison-Findik D. Susa M. Varticovski L. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 1385-1391PubMed Google Scholar).How do Gab1, Cbl, or Shc form complexes with p85 in response to interaction of the host cell with InlB? We hypothesize that InlB engages a receptor on the surface of the mammalian cell, an idea supported by the fact that purified InlB binds to intact Vero cells or other cell lines (12Braun L. Ohayon H. Cossart P. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 27: 1077-1087Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 34Parida S.K. Domann E. Rohde M. Müller S. Darji A. Hain T. Wehland J. Chakraborty T. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 28: 81-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Our current model is that binding of InlB to this receptor leads to tyrosine phosphorylation of Gab1, Cbl, and Shc and association of these adaptor proteins with p85. Complexes containing Gab1, Cbl, or Shc and p85-p110 may be recruited to a cytoplasmic region in the InlB receptor, resulting in membrane translocation of p85-p110 and access to its membrane-bound substrate, PtdIns(4,5)P2.The identity of the putative InlB receptor is not known. Despite some similarities with EGF-mediated signaling, signaling promoted by InlB does not require tyrosine phosphorylation of the EGF-R. InlB-mediated signaling may also be independent of other known receptor tyrosine kinases, such as the insulin, insulin-like growth factor-1, or platelet-derived growth factor receptor, since we do not detect tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins of the expected sizes (95 or 180 kDa) in anti-Tyr(P) or anti-p85 immunoprecipitates from InlB-treated cells (see Fig. 3, A and B). It is possible that the InlB receptor lacks intrinsic kinase activity and is coupled to a cytosolic tyrosine kinase. Clearly, further work is needed to identify the receptor(s) and tyrosine kinase(s) involved in InlB-mediated entry.How does activation of PI 3-kinase lead to bacterial uptake? Experiments with cytochalasin D indicate that an intact actin cytoskeleton is needed for internalization of L. monocytogenes and most other bacterial pathogens (reviewed in Refs. 1Finlay B.B. Falkow S. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1997; 61: 136-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (1162) Google Scholar, 33.Deleted in proof.Google Scholar, and 38Galan J.E. Bliska J.B. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1996; 12: 221-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Interestingly, purified InlB elicits PI 3-kinase-dependent changes in the actin cytoskeleton (membrane ruffling), raising the possibility that p85-p110 may be involved in cytoskeletal changes that mediate uptake. However, we were unable to detect ruffling or other types of accumulation of F-actin near adherent bacteria. Therefore, the potential role of PI 3-kinase in cytoskeletal changes during entry of L. monocytogenes could not be tested. It is not clear why InlB stimulates membrane ruffling when presented to cells as a diffusible ligand, but not when associated with L. monocytogenes. It is possible that the gross cytoskeletal changes caused by soluble InlB are due to ligand diffusion and engagement of receptors over a large surface, whereas InlB present on bacteria clusters a more limited number of receptors and induces more local changes that are less readily detectable. Alternatively, the lack of ruffling seen with L. monocytogenes could be due to an insufficient quantity of InlB interacting with the mammalian cell surface.Understanding how p85-p110 mediates internalization of L. monocytogenes will require the identification of proteins that act downstream of this lipid kinase in bacterial entry. Several proteins have been demonstrated recently to bind and respond to the lipid products of PI 3-kinase, including the phospholipase PLCγ1, some atypical isoforms of protein kinase C, the serine-threonine kinases PDK and Akt, the integrin-binding protein Grp1, and the Arf exchange factor ARNO (11Toker A. Cantley L.G. Nature. 1997; 387: 673-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (1218) Google Scholar). Another signaling protein that interacts with PtdIns(3,4)P2 and PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 is the GTPase Rac (19Missy K.

Rac acts downstream of p85-p110 to mediate membrane ruffling in Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts (39Hawkins P.T. Eginoa A. Qiu R.-G. Stokoe D. Cooke F.T. Walters R. Wennstrom S. Claesson-Welsh L. Evans T. Symons M. Stephens L. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 393-403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar) and is also required for ruffling and Fc-γ receptor-mediated phagocytosis in macrophages (40Cox D. Chang P. Zhang Q. Gopal Reddy P. Bokoch G.M. Greenberg S. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 186: 1487-1494Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). It will be interesting to determine whether Rac or other GTPases are involved in InlB-mediated bacterial entry into non-professional phagocytes or in ruffling induced by InlB. Infection of viral, bacterial, or protozoan intracellular pathogens often involves subversion of mammalian signaling pathways. The first step in the life cycle of an intracellular pathogen is internalization by the host cell. While some microbial pathogens are taken up only by professional phagocytes (macrophages or neutrophils), others induce their own uptake (“enter”) into cells that are not normally phagocytic, such as epithelial cells underlying mucosal surfaces or endothelial cells inside blood vessels (reviewed in Ref.1Finlay B.B. Falkow S. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1997; 61: 136-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (1162) Google Scholar). Entry into non-phagocytic cells can permit traversal of tissue-specific barriers and promote survival of the pathogen by providing access to a nutrient-rich environment that is protected from host antibody or complement. Listeria monocytogenes is a food-borne bacterial pathogen that causes severe illnesses leading to meningitis or abortions in immunocompromised individuals or pregnant women (2Schlech III, W.F. Lavigne P.M. Bortolussi R.A. Allen A.C. Haldane V.E. Wort J.A. Hightower A.W. Johnson S.E. King S.H. Nicholls E.S. Broome C. N. Engl. J. Med. 1983; 308: 203-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (1120) Google Scholar). This faculative intracellular pathogen enters into cells that are non-phagocytic, including epithelial cells and hepatocytes. Entry into such cells is likely to play an important role in traversing the intestinal, blood-brain, and placental barriers, and in colonization of the liver (reviewed in Ref. 3Ireton K. Cossart P. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1997; 31: 113-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Entry of L. monocytogenes into non-phagocytic cells involves specific bacterial surface proteins that exhibit cell tropism. The bacterial protein InlA (internalin) promotes entry into the intestinal epithelial cell line Caco-2, whereas the protein InlB mediates internalization into several other cultured cell lines, including Vero, HEp-2, HeLa, and some hepatocytes (4Dramsi S.

Science. 1996; 274: 780-782Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). InlB has a role in virulence in the mouse model, as a bacterial mutant (ΔinlB) deleted for the inlB gene is defective in colonization of the liver (4Dramsi S. Biswas I. Maguin E. Braun L. Mastroeni P. Cossart P. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 16: 251-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar, 5Lingnau A. Domann E. Hudel M. Bock M. Nichterlein T. Wehland J. Chakraborty T. Infect.

InlA promotes bacterial entry by interacting with its mammalian receptor, the cell-cell adhesion molecule E-cadherin (8Mengaud J. Ohayon H. Gounon P. Mège R.M. Cossart P. Cell. 1996; 84: 923-932Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (698) Google Scholar). The mammalian receptor for InlB is not known. Entry of L. monocytogenes requires tyrosine phosphorylation and other signal transduction events that are likely to occur downstream of engagement of E-cadherin or the InlB receptor (32.Deleted in proof.Google Scholar, 9Cossart P.

Cheah E. Cygler M. Dijkstra B. Frolow F. Franken S.M. Harel M. Remington S.J. Silman I. Schrag J. Sussman J.L. Verschueren K.H.G. Goldman A. Protein Eng. 1992; 5: 197-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (1835) Google Scholar) in which the nucleophilic serine, part of a Ser-His-(Asp/Glu) triad, is located in an extremely sharp turn (nucleophilic elbow). Another feature that is common to all the members of the α/β hydrolase superfamily as well as to proteases is the occurrence of an oxyanion hole, which stabilizes the transition state. Some organophosphorous compounds inhibit lipases in a similar way to what occurs in the case of serine proteases (2Kraut J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1977; 46: 331-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (1073) Google Scholar). The three-dimensional structures of several complexes consisting of lipases bound to covalent inhibitors have been solved: R. miehei lipase (3Derewenda Z.S. Derewenda U. Dodson G.G. J. Mol.

Marguet F. Buono G. Verger R. Cambillau C. van Tilbeurgh H. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 2751-2762Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). It has been established that the covalently inhibited lipases are in the so called “open” conformation, i.e. that the lid has moved away to give free access to the active-site serine. It has been suggested that this mechanism may be instrumental in the binding of lipases to the water-lipid interface and that the presence of a lid in the structure of the enzyme may be involved in the interfacial activation process (4Brzozowski A.M. Derewenda U. Derewenda Z.S. Dodson G.G. Lawson D.M. Turkenburg J.P. Bjorkling F. Huge-Jensen B. Patkar S.A. Thim L.

Nature. 1993; 362: 814-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (633) Google Scholar). Among the mammalian lipases, the acid lipases belong to a family of enzymes that have the ability to withstand acidic conditions. This family that includes the preduodenal lipases and human lysosomal lipase shows no sequence homology with any other known lipase families (11Petersen S.B. Drabløs F. Woolley P. Petersen S. Lipases: Their Biochemistry, Structure, and Application. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, England1994: 23-48Google Scholar). The preduodenal lipases form a group of closely related enzymes originating either from the stomach, the tongue, or the pharynx (12Carrière F. Gargouri Y. Moreau H. Ransac S. Rogalska E. Verger R. Woolley P. Petersen S.B. Lipases: Their Structure, Biochemistry, and Application. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, England1994: 181-205Google Scholar). They all have a low pH optimum, and none of them require any specific protein cofactor. Human gastric lipase (HGL, EC 3.1.1.3) is secreted by the chief cells located in the fundic part of the stomach (13Moreau H. Bernadac A. Gargouri Y. Benkouka F. Laugier R. Verger R. Histochemistry. 1989; 91: 419-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), where it initiates the digestion of triacylglycerols (14Carrière F. Barrowman J.A. Verger R. Laugier R. Gastroenterology. 1993; 105: 876-888Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Hamosh M. Hamosh M. Lingual and Gastric Lipases: Their Role in Fat Digestion. CRC Press, Inc., Boston1990Google Scholar). The maximum specific activities of HGL are 1160 units/mg on TC4 (pH 6.0), 1110 units/mg on TC8 (pH 6.0), and 600 units/mg on IntralipidTM (pH 5.0) (16Gargouri Y. Piéroni G. Rivière C. Saunière J.-F. Lowe P.A. Sarda L. Verger R. Gastroenterology. 1986; 91: 919-925Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Native HGL has an apparent molecular mass of 50 kDa and is a highly glycosylated molecule with 4 potentialN-glycosylation sites (17Bodmer M.W. Angal S. Yarranton G.T. Harris T.J.R. Lyons A. King D.J. Piéroni G. Rivière C. Verger R. Lowe P.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 909: 237-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). The glycan moiety was estimated to account for around 15% of its total protein mass (18Moreau H. Abergel C. Carrière F. Ferrato F. Fontecilla-Camps J.C. Cambillau C. Verger R. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 225: 147-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). This enzyme plays a crucial role in newborns, because pancreatic lipase is not yet fully developed at this age (15Hamosh M. Hamosh M. Lingual and Gastric Lipases: Their Role in Fat Digestion. CRC Press, Inc., Boston1990Google Scholar). The physiological importance of gastric lipase has been suspected for some time, based on pathological situations involving pancreatic exocrine insufficiency, such as the late stage of chronic pancreatitis or cystic fibrosis. In these cases, even in the complete absence of pancreatic lipase, the patients still absorb a high percentage of their ingested dietary fat (19Muller D.P.R. McCollum J.P.K. Tompeter R.S. Harries J.T. Gut. 1975; 16: 838PubMed Google Scholar, 20Lapey A. Kattwinkel J. di Sant Agnese P.A. Laster L. J. Pediatr. 1974; 84: 328-334Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). In substitutive enzymatic therapy, the use of acidic-resistant lipases should in principle yield more satisfactory results than the pancreatic preparations currently in use. The co-administration of acidic lipases, which hydrolyze dietary lipids under acidic conditions, should help to treat patients with various forms of pancreatic deficiency. Physiological studies have shown that preduodenal lipases are capable of acting not only in the stomach but also in the duodenum in synergy with a pancreatic lipase (14Carrière F. Barrowman J.A. Verger R. Laugier R. Gastroenterology. 1993; 105: 876-888Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Various clinical studies have been conducted on both animals and humans to assess the efficacy of enzymatic replacement therapies using acid-resistant lipases to treat exocrine pancreatic insufficiency (21Suzuki A. Mizumoto A. Sarr M.G. Dimagno E.P. Gastroenterology. 1997; 112: 2048-2055Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). This treatment significantly increased the weight and reduced the steatorrhea in dogs. Despite the close amino acid sequence similarities (59% of the amino acids are identical) between HGL (17Bodmer M.W. Angal S. Yarranton G.T. Harris T.J.R. Lyons A. King D.J. Piéroni G. Rivière C. Verger R. Lowe P.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 909: 237-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) and human lysosomal acid lipase (HLAL, EC 3.1.1.3) (22Ameis D. Merkel M. Eckerskorn C. Greten H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 219: 905-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 23Anderson R.A. Sando G.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22479-22484Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), HGL lacks the cholesteryl ester hydrolase activity reported in HLAL. The latter enzyme hydrolyzes not only the triglycerides that are delivered to the lysosomes by low density lipoprotein receptor-mediated endocytosis but also cholesteryl esters (24Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1977; 46: 897-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (1610) Google Scholar). The cholesterol released by this reaction plays an important regulatory role in cellular sterol metabolism. Defective HLAL activity has been found to be associated with two rare autosomal recessive traits, Wolman disease and cholesteryl ester storage disease. In Wolman disease (25Patrick A.D. Lake B.D. Nature. 1969; 222: 1067-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), a lack of HLAL activity results in a pronounced accumulation of cholesteryl esters and triacylglycerols in the lysosomes in most of the body tissues. The patients usually succumb to hepatic and adrenal failure within the first year of life. Cholesteryl ester storage disease, the other clinically recognized phenotypic form of HLAL deficiency, follows a more benign clinical course (26Burke J. Schubert W. Science. 1972; 176: 309-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), and a residual HLAL activity has been detected. Since the cloning of the cDNA and determination of the genomic organization of the gene (LIPA) located on chromosome 10, which encodes HLAL (22Ameis D. Merkel M. Eckerskorn C. Greten H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 219: 905-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 23Anderson R.A. Sando G.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22479-22484Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,27Aslanidis C. Klima H. Lackner K.J. Schmitz G. Genomics. 1994; 20: 329-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), some deleterious LIPA gene mutations have been identified (28Aslanidis C. Ries S. Fehringer P.

The exact correlations between these mutations and the biochemical and clinical phenotypes still remains to be elucidated, however. In this study, the crystal structure of recombinant HGL at 3.0-Å resolution is determined, and a model of HLAL is discussed and used to possibly explain the previously reported cholesteryl ester storage disease mutations. rHGL was expressed in the baculovirus/insect cell system (48Wicker-Planquart C. Canaan S. Rivière M. Dupuis L. Verger R. Protein Eng. 1996; 9: 1225-1232Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The active enzyme was produced on a large scale (5–13 mg/liter) from recombinant baculovirus-infected insect cells using a bioreactor and its specific activity (μmole·min−1·mg−1) was around 700 units/mg (49Canaan S. Dupuis L. Rivière M. Faessel K. Romette J.L. Verger R. Wicker-Planquart C. Protein Expression Purif. 1998; 14: 23-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The amino acid sequence (KLHPG) of rHGL in the purified protein starts at residue 4. Crystallization experiments were performed using the hanging-drop vapor diffusion method. Crystals of the rHGL were obtained by mixing 2 μl of a well solution (2 m ammonium sulfate, 1.4% tert-butanol, at pH 5.0) with 2 μl of a protein solution at 5–6 mg/ml. The crystals are cubic, space group I 21 3 with cell dimensions a = b = c = 244.0 Å3. The protein mass, 47,673 Da, was determined from collected crystals by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight spectroscopy. There are two molecules in the asymmetric unit (see below), and the V m was estimated to be 6.35 Å3/Da (81% water content). For the mercury derivative preparation, the crystals were transferred in a synthetic liquor corresponding to the well solution containing 23 mmmercuric acetate. To assess the catalytic activity of the crystallized enzyme, tests were performed on both dissolved and intact crystals. Ten crystals were washed three times in the crystallization buffer and were subsequently dissolved in 50 μl of water, and the protein concentration was estimated by absorbance at 230 nm. The lipase activity was measured titrimetrically at 37 °C using a pH stat (metrohm) at pH 5.7 with a tributyrin emulsion as the substrate: 0.5 ml of tributyrin added to 14.5 ml of 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm taurodeoxycholate, and 2 mm bovine serum albumin (16Gargouri Y. Piéroni G. Rivière C. Saunière J.-F. Lowe P.A. Sarda L. Verger R. Gastroenterology. 1986; 91: 919-925Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The specific activity (μmole·min−1·mg−1) was calculated and found to be around 580 units/mg. To test the catalytic activityin situ, a single rHGL crystal was incubated in the crystallization solution containing 0.1 mm Nitroblue tetrazolium and 0.75 mm 5 bromo-chloro-3-indoyl butyrate as the substrate. After 24 h of incubation, the crystal was intensely colored in blue/gray. All data sets were collected at 100 K using a cryo-stream cooler from Oxford Cryosystems. A first native and a derivative data set were collected in-house using a 300-mm MAR Research imaging plate detector mounted on a RU200 rotating anode generator (Rigaku, Tokyo, Japan). The generator was operated at 3.2 kW with a focal spot size of 0.3 × 0.3 mm2. A second native data set was collected at LURE (Orsay, France) on DW32 beamline at 0.963 Å wavelength using a 345-mm MAR Research imaging plate. All data were collected in frames of 1.0 degree and processed with DENZO. The scaling was performed with SCALA (CCP4 (50SERC Daresbury Laboratory Collaborative Computing Project 4. A Suite of Programs for Protein Crystallography.Acta. Crystallogr. Sec. D. 1994; 50: 760Crossref PubMed Scopus (19728) Google Scholar)), and the derivative was merged with FHSCAL. Data collection statistics are given in Table I. The fact that most of the crystals diffracted only very poorly made the heavy metal derivative search laborious. In the end, it led to one mercury derivative diffracting to 3.6-Å resolution, isomorphous to the native crystal.Table IData collection, phasing and refinement statisticsNative 1Hg derivativeNative 2Resolution (Å)15–4.115–3.615–3.0Completeness (%)97.9 (99.4)98.9 (95.6)99.6 (100)R-merge (highest shell) (%)26.9 (47.5)16.7 (34.7)6.8 (39.9)I/ς I2.7 (1.6)3.6 (2.1)10.9 (2.0)Redundancy5.3 (5.2)3.1 (3.1)4.0 (4.1)Riso28.4 (15–4.1 Å)Rcullis0.85 acentric/ 0.76 centricFigure of merit0.268 (0.255 acentric/ 0.456 centric)Phasing power1.14 acentric/ 0.9 centricRefinement statisticsResolution15.0–3.0R / Rfree(%)22.5 / 25.1Nr reflections45522 (2381 free)Nr atoms6194ς bond (Å) / ς angle (°)0.007/ 1.392Ramachandran Procheck (61) zones 1–3 (%)85.5 / 13.3 / 1.2 Open table in a new tab The position of the heavy metal was determined using Patterson methods. The MLPHARE software program (51Otwinowski Z. Evans P. Leslie A. Isomorphous Replacement and Anomalous Scattering. SERC Daresbury Laboratory, Warrington WA4, UK1991: 80-85Google Scholar) was then used to refine the heavy atom parameters and calculate phases to 4.0 Å, taking into account both isomorphous and anomalous differences. Resulting single isomorphous replacement with anomalous scattering (SIRAS) phases were considerably improved after flattening 80% of the solvent using density modification. At this stage, the map indicated clearly that the handedness of the helices was wrong. Repeating the previous steps with the heavy atom position giving the negative coordinates yielded a suitable map for determining an envelope for each of the two molecules in the asymmetric unit. The noncrystallographic symmetry operators were determined using both the GLRF program and the relation between the two molecular replacement solutions (automated molecular replacement density modification (52Navaza J. Acta Crystallogr. Sec. A. 1994; 50: 157-163Crossref Scopus (5027) Google Scholar)) obtained from a search using a bones model (MAPMAN (53Kleywegt G. Jones T. From First Map to Final Model. EPSRC, Daresbury Warrington WA4, UK1994: 59-66Google Scholar)) calculated on the basis of one molecule. The density modification program was then used again to improve the initial phases (from MLPHARE) by performing simultaneously solvent flattening, histogram matching, 2-fold noncrystallographic symmetry averaging, and phase extension. The best map was obtained when a suitable mask around one of the molecules was added to the program. The resolution of the derivative data set was actually better than that of the native one, and the map was therefore calculated using the derivative structure factor amplitudes with the phases extended to 3.6 Å. The model was built with the program TURBO-FRODO (54Roussel A. Cambillau C. Graphics S. Silicon Graphics Geometry Partners Directory. Silicon Graphics, Mountain View, CA1991: 86Google Scholar) using the recently developedab-initio building tools, which make it possible to build a model from planar pseudo-residues in a very short time. When the connectivity and the direction of the polypeptide chain have been determined, the pseudo-residues are automatically replaced by the actual residues in the sequence. Side-chain fitting is then performed manually. When most of the model had been built, a 3.0-Å native data set was collected on synchrotron radiation at the LURE. These better data were then used to calculate a new map, with which the model was completed (370 residues of 376 in the recombinant protein). The four sugar glycosylation sites were already clearly identified in this experimental electron density map. Refinement was carried out in X-PLOR (55Brünger A.T. X-PLOR, Version 3.1. Yale University Press, New Haven, CT1992Google Scholar) against the 3.0-Å data. Five percent of the data were set aside for calculating and monitoring of the free R-factor (Rfree). Refinement involved cycles of simulated annealing using the slow-cool procedure interspersed with manual rebuilding. Noncrystallographic symmetry restraints were applied during the whole refinement procedure. Individual B-factor refinement was subsequently performed. The final model consisted of 6194 atoms; the final R-factor was 22.5%, and the R-free factor was 25.1%. The complete refinement statistics, given in Table I, the quality of the Ramachandran plot, and the electron density indicate that the model is better than expected for a structure at 3.0-Å resolution. Maps calculated from the derivative structure factor amplitudes showed a clear electron density for the mercury derivative bound to cysteine 244 but no significant movements of any part of the model.

Abergel C. Carrière F. Ferrato F. Fontecilla-Camps J.C. Cambillau C. Verger R. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 225: 147-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), useful cubic crystals were finally obtained from rHGL expressed in the insect cell/baculovirus expression system. The structure of rHGL has been solved by a combination of SIRAS, solvent flattening, and 2-fold averaging at 4.5 Å resolution. Phase extension procedures have made it possible to extend the resolution to 3.6 Å. A preliminary model was constructed at this resolution. The final structure was refined to 3.0-Å resolution using restrained noncrystallographic symmetry between the two molecules. The crystallographic R-factor based on all the data between 15.0 and 3.0 Å is 22.6%, and the corresponding R-free is 25.1% with a model containing residues 9 to 53 and 57 to 379, 6 sugar residues located on the 4 potential N-glycosylation sites, and 46 water molecules/monomer. rHGL consists of one globular domain (Fig.1) and belongs to the α/β hydrolase-fold family (1Ollis D.L. Cheah E. Cygler M. Dijkstra B. Frolow F. Franken S.M. Harel M. Remington S.J. Silman I. Schrag J. Sussman J.L. Verschueren K.H.G. Goldman A. Protein Eng. 1992; 5: 197-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (1835) Google Scholar). The core domain, which is located between residues 9–183 and 309–379 (Figs. 1 and 2) contains a central β sheet composed of 8 strands, 7 of which are parallel and 1 antiparallel (strand 2) with 1(-2)435678 connectivity, and 6 helices, 3 on each side of the β-sheet (Fig. 1 C). Two segments are missing in the electron density maps. The first of these was from residues 4 to 9, because the electron density starts abruptly at residue 9. In the region of the second lacking segment (residues 54 to 56), some faint electron density was observed, suggesting that the loop may be intact but disordered (Fig. 1). The accessibility of this loop is consistent with the previously reported preferential trypsin cleavage site (Arg-55) of rabbit gastric lipase (35De Caro J. Verger R. De Caro A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1386: 39-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). In comparison with the canonical α/β hydrolase fold, an extra helix (α1) is present at the N terminus. Helix αA is shorter and has moved to the bottom of the structure, helix αB is replaced by two helices (αB1 and αB2), and helix αD is replaced by an extra domain (residues 184 to 308, Figs. 1 and 2) located between strands 6 and 7. Protrusions have been observed in other lipases, generally constituting the device covering the active site and called the lid. A “cap” domain occurs at the same location in wheat serine carboxypeptidase II (residues 181 to 311, WCSII) (36Liao D.I. Breddam K. Sweet R.M. Bullock T. Remington S.J. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 9796"
https://openalex.org/W2071497437,"The carboxyl-terminal cytoplasmic domain of the angiotensin II type 1 (AT1) receptor has recently been shown to interact with several classes of cytoplasmic proteins that regulate different aspects of AT1 receptor physiology. Employing yeast two-hybrid screening of a mouse kidney cDNA library with the carboxyl-terminal cytoplasmic domain of the murine AT1a receptor as a bait, we have isolated a novel protein with a predicted molecular mass of 18 kDa, which we have named ATRAP (for AT1 receptor-associated protein). ATRAP interacts specifically with the carboxyl-terminal domain of the AT1areceptor but not with those of angiotensin II type 2 (AT2), m3 muscarinic acetylcholine, bradykinin B2, endothelin B, and β2-adrenergic receptors. The mRNA of ATRAP was abundantly expressed in kidney, heart, and testis but was poorly expressed in lung, liver, spleen, and brain. The ATRAP-AT1a receptor association was confirmed by affinity chromatography, by specific co-immunoprecipitation of the two proteins, and by fluorescence microscopy, showing co-localization of these proteins in intact cells. Overexpression of ATRAP in COS-7 cells caused a marked inhibition of AT1a receptor-mediated activation of phospholipase C without affecting m3 receptor-mediated activation.

AngII exerts its biological effects through two major subtypes of high affinity GPCRs designated AT1 and AT2receptors. Recently, the carboxyl-terminal cytoplasmic domain of the AT1 receptor has been reported to directly associate with several downstream effectors (12Ali M.S. Sayeski P.P. Dirksen L.B. Hayzer D.J.

By means of mutational analysis, this domain has also been shown to contain discrete amino acid sequences that are required for receptor desensitization (17Conchon S. Peltier N. Corvol P. Clauser E.

As for many GPCRs, the carboxyl-terminal cytoplasmic domain of the AT1 receptor presumably interacts with G protein-coupled receptor kinases and arrestins, causing functional desensitization of the receptor (18Tang H. Guo D.F. Porter J.P. Wanaka Y. Inagami T. Circ. Res. 1998; 82: 523-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 21Oppermann M. Freedman N.J. Alexander R.W. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol.

These observations raise the possibility that the carboxyl-terminal cytoplasmic domain of the AT1 receptor interacts with additional cellular proteins that may play an important role in the efficacy and/or specificity of receptor-G protein coupling. We have investigated this possibility by searching for novel protein interactions with the carboxyl-terminal cytoplasmic domain of the murine AT1a receptor. Using interaction cloning as well as biochemical and immunocytochemical techniques, we report here the identification of a novel protein that specifically interacts with the AT1 receptor tail. Functional studies suggest that this protein interaction may play a role in the regulation of receptor-mediated signaling. The carboxyl-terminal cytoplasmic domain of the murine AT1a receptor (AT1a C-ter; amino acids 297 to 359) was polymerase chain reaction-amplified and fused to the Gal4 binding domain in the yeast shuttle vector pBD-Gal4 (Stratagene). In a similar manner, 3 carboxyl-terminal deletions of the AT1a receptor tail (AT1a C-ter Δ349, Δ339, and Δ329) were generated by polymerase chain reaction with use of reverse primers containing stop codons at the desired locations, and the deleted cDNA were subcloned into pBD-Gal4. The carboxyl-terminal cytoplasmic domains of human AT2 (amino acids 314 to 363), human m3 muscarinic acetylcholine (amino acids 548 to 590), human bradykinin B2 (amino acids 299 to 364), endothelin B (amino acids 390 to 442), and β2-adrenergic (amino acids 328 to 413) receptors were polymerase chain reaction-amplified and subcloned into pBD-Gal4. All the constructs were verified by DNA sequencing using the Sanger dideoxy termination method adapted to the Applied Biosystems model 373S Automated DNA Sequencer. A cDNA library from mouse kidney poly(A)+ RNA was constructed in fusion with the Gal4 activation domain in pAD-Gal4 (Stratagene) with a cDNA synthesis kit from Stratagene using XhoI-(dT)18 primer andEcoRI adaptors. The yeast reporter strain YRG-2 (Stratagene) containing 2 Gal4-inducible reporter genes (HIS3 and LacZ) was sequentially co-transformed with the AT1a C-ter hybrid expression plasmid and the mouse kidney cDNA library as described previously (22Benichou S. Bomsel M. Bodéus M. Durand H. Douté M. Letourneur F. Camonis J. Benarous R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30073-30076Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Double transformants were plated on yeast drop-out media lacking tryptophan, leucine, and histidine. The transformants were grown for 3 days, and His+ colonies were then patched on selective media, replica-plated on nitrocellulose filters, and tested for β-galactosidase activity (23Breeden L. Nasmyth K. Cold Spring Harbor Sympt. Quant. Biol. 1985; 50: 643-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). Positive clones were rescued and tested for specificity by retransformation into strain YRG-2 with either AT1a C-ter or the extraneous targets human lamin C and murine p53 (Stratagene). The cDNA inserts from positive clones were then sequenced. The Northern blot was purchased fromCLONTECH and hybridized with α-32P-ATRAP and β-actin cDNAs according to the manufacturer's recommendations. The cytoplasmic AT1a and AT2 receptor tails were amplified by polymerase chain reaction and cloned into a pMal-c2 prokaryotic expression vector (New England Biolabs). MBP fusion polypeptides were expressed inEscherichia coli DH5α and purified according to the manufacturer's instructions. The MBP fusion protein load of individual amylose resins was normalized by densitometric scanning of SDS-PAGE gels stained with Coomassie Blue. For affinity chromatography, a 50-μl volume of the MBP fusion protein-loaded resins (50% (v/v) suspensions) was preblocked in binding buffer (50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 μg of aprotinin/ml) with bovine serum albumin (10 mg/ml) for 1 h at 4 °C. The MBP fusion protein resins were then incubated with a lysate (100 μg of protein) of COS-7 cells transiently transfected with an HA epitope-tagged version of ATRAP (HA-ATRAP) in binding buffer for 16 h at 4 °C. Resins were washed four times with binding buffer and eluted with SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Samples were then subjected to SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membrane (Hybond-ECL, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and probed with anti-HA monoclonal antibody 12CA5 (Boehringer Mannheim). Epitope-tagged ATRAP was detected with peroxidase-conjugated sheep anti-mouse secondary antibody (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and enzyme-linked chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The NH2-terminal HA epitope-tagged ATRAP in pcDNA3 was transiently co-transfected with a FLAG-tagged murine AT1a receptor (24Hein L. Meinel L. Pratt R.E. Dzau V.J. Kobilka B.K. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 1266-1277Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar) in COS-7 cells according to the LipofectAMINE protocol (Life Technologies, Inc.). The ratio of AT1a and ATRAP DNA was 1:3. Cells were harvested 48 h after transfection, and membrane fractions prepared from the transfected cells (25Mukoyama M. Nakajima M. Horiuchi M. Sasmura H. Pratt R.E. Dzau V.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24539-24542Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were solubilized in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 140 mm NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 μg of aprotinin/ml (buffer A) in the presence of 1% CHAPS. The mixture was gently agitated for 30 min at 4 °C and thereafter centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 20 min. Cleared supernatants (100 μg of protein) were diluted 1:10 in buffer A and incubated for 16 h at 4 °C with M1 monoclonal antibody recognizing the FLAG epitope (Eastman Kodak Co.) and protein A/G PLUS-agarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The beads were then washed in buffer A, and the samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membrane, and probed with anti-HA monoclonal antibody 12CA5. HA-ATRAP was detected with peroxidase-conjugated sheep anti-mouse antibody and ECL. COS-7 cells were seeded in glass coverslips and co-transfected with NH2-terminal HA-tagged ATRAP and FLAG epitope-tagged AT1a using the method described above. The cells were then fixed and permeabilized with ice-cold methanol for 5 min. HA-ATRAP was detected with either the monoclonal mouse antibody 12CA5 and a fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated rat anti-mouse IgG2b monoclonal antibody (Pharmingen) or an HA-specific rabbit antiserum (Babco) and CY3-goat anti-rabbit antibody (Zymed Laboratories Inc.). AT1a receptor was detected with the monoclonal mouse antibody M1 and a fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated rat anti-mouse IgG2b monoclonal antibody. The yeast reporter strain SFY526 was co-transformed with the deleted versions of the AT1aC-ter and the ATRAP hybrid expression plasmid. The amounts of β-galactosidase from three independent transformants grown in liquid selective media were measured in a chlorophenol red-β-d-galactopyranoside-based assay (26Iwabuchi K. Li B. Bartel P. Fields S. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 1693-1696PubMed Google Scholar). COS-7 cells were transiently co-transfected with NH2-terminal HA epitope-tagged ATRAP and FLAG epitope-tagged AT1a receptor or human m3 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor using the LipofectAMINE reagent. The ratio of receptor and ATRAP DNA was 1:3. Transfected cells plated in 12-well plates (2 × 105cells/well) were labeled overnight withmyo-[3H]inositol (5 μCi/ml; NEN Life Science Products) in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. After 1 h of stimulation with increasing concentrations of AngII or carbachol in the presence of 10 mm LiCl, inositol phosphate was extracted and separated on Dowex AG1-X8 columns (Bio-Rad). Total inositol phosphate was eluted with 2 m ammonium formate, 0.1 m formic acid. Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) K1 cells were co-transfected with the FLAG-tagged murine AT1areceptor expression vector (24Hein L. Meinel L. Pratt R.E. Dzau V.J. Kobilka B.K. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 1266-1277Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar) and pSV2-Neo with the LipofectAMINE reagent (using a 30:1 DNA ratio). Stably transfected cells were selected in G418 (800 μg/ml; Life Technologies) for 3 weeks, and the cells expressing high levels of AT1areceptors were sorted by fluorescence-activated cell sorting after immunolabeling with the anti-FLAG M1 monoclonal antibody. The immunoselected, stably transfected CHO AT1a cells were maintained in G418 and used for up to four passages. 3.5 × 105 CHO AT1a were seeded in 6-well plates and transiently co-transfected with pcDNA3/HA-ATRAP,fos-luciferase reporter gene (p2FTL) and β-galactosidase reporter gene (pCMVβ; CLONTECH) by lipofection using the LipofectAMINE reagent. The fos-luciferase reporter gene consists of two copies of the c-fos 5′-regulated enhancer element (−357 to −276), the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase gene promoter (−200 to +70), and luciferase gene (4Wang C. Jayadev S. Escobedo J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16677-16682Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The ratio of HA-ATRAP, fos-luciferase, and β-gal DNA was 3:1:1. Forty-eight h after transfection, transfected cells were incubated in serum-free medium (Ham's F12; Life Technologies) for 16 h. Quiescent cells were then treated with 100 nm AngII for 3.5 h, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and lysed for 10 min with 250 μl of lysis buffer (luciferase assay system; Promega) at 4 °C. 10 μl of cell extract was mixed with 100 μl of luciferase reagent, and the light produced was measured for 10 s using a LUMAT LB 9507 luminometer (EG & G Berthold). Results were normalized to the β-gal activity using a β-galactosidase enzyme assay system (Promega). For AT1areceptor-transfected COS-7 and CHO K1 cells, ligand binding assays were performed using membrane preparations as described elsewhere (25Mukoyama M. Nakajima M. Horiuchi M. Sasmura H. Pratt R.E. Dzau V.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24539-24542Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For m3 receptor-transfected COS-7 cells, binding assays usingN-[3H]methylscopolamine (NEN Life Science Products) were carried out with membrane homogenates as described previously (28Blin N. Yun J. Wess J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17741-17748Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Nonspecific binding was measured in the presence of 1 μm atropine. For the inositol phosphate andfos-luciferase assay, results are expressed as mean ±S.E. Statistical significance was assessed by t test. The yeast two-hybrid system was used to identify candidate proteins that interact with the carboxyl-terminal cytoplasmic tail of the mouse AT1a receptor. Screening of 1.5 × 106 transformants from a mouse kidney primary cDNA library resulted in the isolation of three independent clones that interacted specifically with the AT1a carboxyl-terminal tail. No interaction with another major subtype of AngII receptor (AT2) was observed. Sequence analysis revealed that the three library plasmids contained different lengths of the same cDNA. All inserts contained an open reading frame, and inspection of the sequence of the longest cDNA revealed a potential initiator ATG that matched well the consensus sequence for translational initiation (29Kozak M. Cell. 1986; 44: 283-292Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3590) Google Scholar). This clone spans an open reading frame of 483 base pairs encoding a predicted protein of 17.8 kDa (Fig.1). We named this protein ATRAP forAT1receptor associatedprotein. The failure of 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends to lead to the isolation of longer cDNA suggested that the clone isolated from the two-hybrid screen represents the full-length gene. Moreover, the mobility of an in vitro translation product was in agreement with the molecular mass predicted for ATRAP by sequence analysis (data not shown). The ATRAP-predicted amino acid sequence was used to search available data bases by means of the BLAST program network server. ATRAP does not show homology with known proteins. However, it is similar to at least three mouse EST clones (accession numbers AA718794, AA840135, and W57121) and is homologous to a number of human and rat EST clones. ATRAP has one potentialN-glycosylation site, one potential phosphorylation site for protein kinase C, and one potential phosphorylation site for casein kinase II (Fig. 1). This protein also contained several extensive hydrophobic domains in its NH2-terminal portion. Northern blot analysis of messenger RNA from various mouse tissues, with full-length ATRAP cDNA as a probe, revealed two transcripts of 1.2 and 0.8 kilobases; this result further suggested that the cDNA clone represents the full-length gene. ATRAP was expressed at a relatively high level in kidney, testis, and heart but at lower levels in lung, liver, spleen, and brain (Fig.2). Using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, we also detected ATRAP transcripts in mouse aortic tissue and vascular smooth muscle cells (data not shown). To biochemically confirm the association between ATRAP and AT1a C-ter, in vitro interactions were examined in studies using AT1a and AT2 receptor cytoplasmic tails fused to MBP. When added to detergent-solubilized extracts of ATRAP-transfected COS-7 cells, ATRAP was recovered with the recombinant MBP-AT1a C-ter but not with MBP-AT2C-ter or the MBP alone (Fig.3 A). These results further suggested that ATRAP associates specifically with the AT1receptor. The binding of ATRAP to full-length AT1a receptors in vivo was confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation from transfected COS-7 cells. The AT1a receptor was tagged at the amino-terminal extracellular domain with a FLAG epitope to facilitate specific immunoprecipitation of receptors (24Hein L. Meinel L. Pratt R.E. Dzau V.J. Kobilka B.K. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 1266-1277Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). For the immunodetection of ATRAP, the protein was HA-tagged at the amino terminus, and a polypeptide of the expected size was observed by immunoblotting in transfected cells (Fig. 3B, 1st lane). ATRAP was co-immunoprecipitated specifically from cell membrane lysates in association with the AT1a receptor (Fig. 3 B, 4thlane). ATRAP was not detected in control immunoprecipitates, including those prepared from cells expressing ATRAP without FLAG-tagged receptors (Fig. 3B, 2nd lane); this result confirmed the specificity of this protein association in vivo. We did not observe a significant difference in the amount of ATRAP co-immunoprecipitated with the AT1 receptor before or after AngII stimulation (data not shown). The subcellular localization of epitope-tagged ATRAP was examined in transfected COS-7 cells by fluorescence microscopy. Using optical sectioning of antibody-labeled cells by confocal microscopy, ATRAP was visualized in a diffuse cytoplasmic distribution, with a more intensive staining near the cell periphery (Fig.4 A). Immunoblotting of extensively washed membrane fractions prepared from transfected cells confirmed that a significant fraction of ATRAP was membrane-associated (data not shown). The association of ATRAP with AT1areceptors was further examined by immunofluorescence co-localization experiments. COS-7 cells were co-transfected with HA-tagged ATRAP and FLAG-tagged AT1a receptors and were co-stained with anti-FLAG (Fig. 4 B, green) and anti-HA (panel C, red) antibodies. Superposition of these images showed considerable co-localization (panel D,yellow) of the two proteins at the periphery of the cells and in intracellular compartments. Several proteins that associate with the carboxyl-terminal cytoplasmic domain of GPCRs regulate receptor-mediated signaling. Mutational analysis of the AT1 receptor tail has demonstrated that it contains discrete amino acid sequences that are important for receptor desensitization (17Conchon S. Peltier N. Corvol P. Clauser E. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: E336-E345PubMed Google Scholar, 18Tang H. Guo D.F. Porter J.P. Wanaka Y. Inagami T. Circ.

Recent studies have implicated protein kinase C and G protein-coupled receptor kinases in the heterologous and homologous desensitization of the AT1a receptor, respectively (18Tang H. Guo D.F. Porter J.P. Wanaka Y. Inagami T. Circ. Res. 1998; 82: 523-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 21Oppermann M. Freedman N.J. Alexander R.W. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13266-13272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Three protein kinase C phosphorylation sites and a sequence that has partial homology to the consensus G protein-coupled receptor kinases phosphorylation motif (amino acids 343 to 348) are present within the carboxyl-terminal cytoplasmic domain of the AT1a receptor (30Berk B.C. Corson M.A. Circ. Res. 1997; 80: 607-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). To gain insight into the functional significance of the ATRAP-AT1areceptor association, we first localized the binding site for ATRAP within the AT1a receptor tail. By generating serial deletions in the receptor tail, we found that the ATRAP-binding site localized within the last 20 carboxyl-terminal amino acids (339 to 359) of the receptor (Table I). It is interesting that this sequence comprises two of the three protein kinase C sites and the unique potential G protein-coupled receptor kinases phosphorylation motif found in the AT1a cytoplasmic domain (30Berk B.C. Corson M.A. Circ. Res. 1997; 80: 607-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). Moreover, a recent functional characterization of truncated AT1a receptors lacking varying lengths of the cytoplasmic tail demonstrated that the region encompassing residues 328 to 348 plays an important role in the desensitization of the AT1a receptor (18Tang H. Guo D.F. Porter J.P. Wanaka Y. Inagami T. Circ. Res. 1998; 82: 523-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). To examine the possibility that ATRAP affects receptor desensitization, the effect of ATRAP overexpression on agonist-dependent activation of phospholipase C (PLC) was examined in AT1a receptor-transfected cells. As shown in Fig. 5, overexpression of ATRAP markedly inhibited the PLC response over a wide range of agonist concentrations. PLC activation was maximally inhibited by an average of 35% (10−8m Ang II) in cells co-transfected with ATRAP and AT1a receptors when compared with cells co-transfected with AT1a receptors and the control plasmid. Radioligand binding assays performed with the same populations of transfectants used in the PLC assay indicated that ATRAP overexpression did not significantly affect the affinity or the number of AT1a receptors (Table II). The magnitude of the inhibitory effect of ATRAP overexpression may be influenced by the expression of endogenous ATRAP in COS-7 cells, as detected by Northern blot analysis (data not shown). Furthermore, the effect of ATRAP on receptor signaling may depend on its association with other cellular partners that may be present in limiting amounts relative to overexpressed ATRAP. To assess whether ATRAP associates with other GPCRs, we examined its interaction with the carboxyl-terminal cytoplasmic domains of several Gq-coupled receptors in the yeast two-hybrid system. ATRAP did not interact with the carboxyl-terminal cytoplasmic tails of the m3muscarinic, bradykinin B2, or endothelin B receptors, nor did it associate with the Gs-coupled β2-adrenergic receptor (data not shown). Accordingly, no effect of ATRAP overexpression was observed on m3receptor-mediated PLC activation over a wide range of agonist concentrations (10−9 to 10−5mcarbachol) or on basal PLC activity. Moreover, ATRAP did not affect PLC (β and γ isoforms) expression level as determined by immunoblot analysis (data not shown). Taken together, these observations are consistent with the hypothesis that ATRAP specifically inhibits signaling by interacting directly with AT1a receptors rather than by affecting receptor expression or downstream signaling components. Moreover, the specificity of this inhibition is consistent with the specificity of ATRAP association with the receptor tailin vitro. The observation that AngII binding did not affect the ATRAP-AT1 receptor interaction would suggest that ATRAP function may be regulated by other means such as post-transcriptional modifications (phosphorylation/dephosphorylation) or alternatively by its association with others cellular proteins in response to AT1 receptor stimulation.Table IYeast two-hybrid interaction of ATRAP to deletion mutants of the AT1a receptor tailGal4 binding domain hybridGal4 activation domain hybridβ-Gal units% BindingAT1a C-ter wild typeATRAP160100AT1a C-ter Δ349ATRAP6037.5AT1a C-ter Δ339ATRAP00AT1a C-ter Δ329ATRAP00Yeast reporter strain YSF526 was co-transformed with the indicated Gal4 hybrid vectors.

To assess whether ATRAP may influence a more downstream AT1receptor-dependent signaling event, we examined the effect of ATRAP overexpression on AngII-induced c-fos gene expression. CHO AT1a cells (K d = 0.3 ± 0.05 nm; B max = 4.2 ± 1.2 pmol/mg of membrane protein) were transiently co-transfected with a fos-luciferase reporter gene together with ATRAP or a control vector. The fos-luciferase reporter construct contains the serum response element of the c-fos promoter (4Wang C. Jayadev S. Escobedo J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16677-16682Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), which has been shown to be sufficient for AngII-induced activation of the c-fos promoter (27Sadoshima J. Izumo S. Circ. Res. 1993; 73: 424-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). AngII-induced c-fosexpression was determined by measuring the increase infos-luciferase activity in lysates of co-transfected cells after AngII treatment. ATRAP overexpression did not significantly affect AngII-dependent increase in c-fosexpression when compared with cells transfected with the control plasmid (data not shown). AngII-induced activation of the serum response element of the c-fos promoter has been proposed to involve protein kinase C and ERK1/2 (extracellular signal-regulated kinase) stimulation (30Berk B.C. Corson M.A. Circ. Res. 1997; 80: 607-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). In contrast to the proximal effector PLC, induction of c-fos expression is a downstream signaling event that requires the activation of a cascade of effectors. Therefore, it is conceivable that the attenuated PLC response observed in cells overexpressing ATRAP is insufficient to affect the downstream effectors involved in the induction of the c-fos reporter gene expression. In conclusion, we have identified a novel, membrane-localized protein that interacts specifically with the carboxyl-terminal cytoplasmic domain of the AT1a receptor and blunts agonist-dependent PLC activation. It is conceivable that ATRAP attenuates receptor-mediated signaling by regulating a known mechanism of receptor desensitization such as phosphorylation. Because of the wide expression of ATRAP in commonly used cell lines, dominant-negative or knock-out approaches would be helpful to further elucidate its function in AT1 receptor signaling. Based on our present results, ATRAP appears to function as a negative regulator of AT1 receptor-mediated signaling. Given that the AT1 receptor is a key mediator in the biologic mechanisms of the renin-angiotensin system, ATRAP may play a significant role in the regulation of cardiovascular physiology.

Alvarez L. Ortiz P. Pajares M.A. Pharmacol. Ther. 1997; 73: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). AdoMet is synthesized from methionine and ATP by the enzyme methionine adenosyltransferase (MAT). There are two MAT genes; one is expressed only in the liver, and the other is expressed in extrahepatic tissues and fetal liver (2Kotb M. Geller A.M. Pharmacol. Ther. 1993; 59: 125-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 3Mato J.M. Alvarez L. Ortiz P. Pajares M.A. Pharmacol. Ther. 1997; 73: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar, 4Kotb M.

Up to 85% of all methylation reactions and as much as 50% of methionine metabolism occur in the liver (5Mudd S.H. Poole J.R. Metabolism. 1975; 24: 721-735Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar), which agrees with this tissue having the highest specific activity of MAT (6Finkelstein J.D. J. Nutr. Biochem. 1990; 1: 228-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (1076) Google Scholar). Moreover, in the liver the half-life of AdoMet is of only about 5 min (6Finkelstein J.D. J. Nutr. Biochem. 1990; 1: 228-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (1076) Google Scholar). Reduced levels of AdoMet and/or MAT activity, resulting in the abnormal metabolism of methionine, have been found in human cirrhosis and in a variety of experimental models including liver injury induced by ethanol, CCl4, and galactosamine (3Mato J.M. Alvarez L. Ortiz P. Pajares M.A. Pharmacol. Ther. 1997; 73: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar, 7Mato J.M. Alvarez L. Corrales F. Pajares M.A. Arias I.M. Boyer J.L. Fausto N. Schaachter D.A. The Liver Biology and Pathobiology. Raven Press, Ltd., New York1994: 461-470Google Scholar). The importance of this alteration in AdoMet synthesis in the pathogenesis of a variety of liver disorders is suggested by the finding that exogenous AdoMet administration protects from the hepatotoxic effect induced by a variety of agents, such as ethanol, CCl4, paracetamol, tumor necrosis factor, and galactosamine (3Mato J.M. Alvarez L. Ortiz P. Pajares M.A. Pharmacol. Ther. 1997; 73: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar, 7Mato J.M. Alvarez L. Corrales F. Pajares M.A. Arias I.M. Boyer J.L. Fausto N. Schaachter D.A. The Liver Biology and Pathobiology. Raven Press, Ltd., New York1994: 461-470Google Scholar). The cellular factors regulating hepatic AdoMet levels are beginning to be defined. One such factor is nitric oxide (NO). In previous studies we demonstrated that conditions that induce NO synthesis, such as septic shock and hypoxia, induce the inactivation of hepatic MAT without affecting the expression of the liver-specific MAT gene (8Avila M.A. Mingorance J.

Gastroenterology. 1998; 114: 364-371Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Further, we have reported previously that incubation of rat hepatocytes withS-nitrosoglutathione monoethyl ester (EGSNO), a cell-permeable NO donor, induces MAT inactivation (10Ruiz F. Corrales F.J. Miqueo C. Mato J.M. Hepatology. 1998; 28: 1051-1057Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). We have also shown that purified rat liver MAT is inactivated by incubation with NO donors (3-morpholinosydnonimine,S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine, andS-nitrosoglutathione) (8Avila M.A. Mingorance J. Martı́nez-Chantar M.L. Casado M. Martı́n-Sanz P. Boscá L. Mato J.M. Hepatology. 1997; 25: 391-396PubMed Google Scholar, 10Ruiz F. Corrales F.J. Miqueo C. Mato J.M. Hepatology. 1998; 28: 1051-1057Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). In addition, we have recently demonstrated that liver MAT is S-nitrosylated both in vitro and in vivo (10Ruiz F. Corrales F.J. Miqueo C. Mato J.M. Hepatology. 1998; 28: 1051-1057Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), and further, we have identified cysteine 121 as the site of molecular interaction of NO and liver MAT (8Avila M.A. Mingorance J. Martı́nez-Chantar M.L. Casado M. Martı́n-Sanz P. Boscá L. Mato J.M. Hepatology. 1997; 25: 391-396PubMed Google Scholar). Because these results indicate that NO (or related molecules) is a critical regulator of liver MAT activity, we were interested in whether AdoMet content in hepatocytes is regulated by NO. There are few studies trying to identify the active site features that control protein S-nitrosylation. It has been recently proposed (11Stamler J.S. Toone E.J. Lipton S.A. Sucher N.J. Neuron. 1997; 18: 691-696Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (610) Google Scholar) that protein S-nitrosylation involves an acid-base-catalyzed nitrosothiol (SNO)/SH exchange reaction, where the target cysteine residue is localized next to basic and acidic amino acids. Here, we were interested in determining the structural factors that govern liver MAT S-nitrosylation and inactivation using liver recombinant enzyme and mutants of MAT where the acidic and basic amino acids in the vicinity of cysteine 121 were replaced by serine by site-directed mutagenesis. Recognition of the topology involved in protein S-nitrosylation is likely to prove useful in identifying new targets of protein S-nitrosylation. Hepatocytes were isolated from normally fed Wistar rats (250 g) as described previously (10Ruiz F. Corrales F.J. Miqueo C. Mato J.M. Hepatology. 1998; 28: 1051-1057Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Isolated hepatocytes were incubated in the absence or presence of EGSNO at 37 °C. At the indicated periods of time, 2 ml of the cell suspension (2 × 106 cells/ml) were poured into precooled centrifuge tubes and washed twice with phosphate/saline buffer. Hepatocytes were then used for AdoMet or MAT activity determinations. Cell viability was determined before and after incubations by the trypan blue exclusion test. Only preparations with viability over 85% were used. AdoMet concentration was determined by high pressure liquid chromatography following the procedure described by Fell et al. (12Fell D. Benjamin L.E. Steele R.D. J. Chromatogr. 1985; 345: 150-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) modified by Miller et al.(13Miller J.W. Nachau M.R. Smith J. Smith D. Selhub J. Biochem. J. 1994; 298: 415-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Samples of 2 × 106 hepatocytes washed twice in phosphate/saline buffer were homogenized in 200 μl of 0.4m perchloric acid. Homogenates were centrifuged at 10,000 × g and 4 °C for 15 min. 100 μl of the supernatant were analyzed on a Bio-Sil® ODS-5S column equilibrated in 0.01 m ammonium formate, 4 mmheptanesulfonic acid, pH 4.0. Elution was carried out with a 31-min linear gradient of acetonitrile (0–25%) in the same buffer. Chromatograms were analyzed using the Beckman System Gold software. Mutants are identified by a number that indicates the residue in the sequence of the enzyme that has been replaced. MAT mutants C121S, D355S, D355E, R357S, R363S, R363K, G359S, and R357S/R363S were obtained by inverse polymerase chain reaction according to the procedure of Serrano et al. (14Serrano L. Horovitz A. Avron B. Bycroft M. Fersht A.R. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 9343-9352Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar) using the plasmid pSSRL, which includes a 1.2-kilobase pair fragment containing the rat liver MAT coding region (15Mingorance J. Alvarez L. Sánchez-Góngora E. Mato J.M. Pajares M.A. Biochem. J. 1996; 315: 761-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The mutants were identified by sequencing of the complete MAT cDNA. Expression and purification of WT (wild type) and mutant proteins were carried out as described previously (15Mingorance J. Alvarez L. Sánchez-Góngora E. Mato J.M. Pajares M.A. Biochem. J. 1996; 315: 761-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Protein purity was greater than 95% in all preparations as determined by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Protein concentration was measured using the Bio-Rad protein assay kit based on the Bradford assay (16Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211983) Google Scholar). The recombinant WT and MAT mutants analyzed presented similar values of specific activity: 4.36 ± 0.28, 4.19 ± 0.72, 3.97 ± 0.91, 4.22 ± 0.31, 3.89 ± 0.74, 4.23 ± 0.41, 4.89 ± 0.52, 4.01 ± 0.67, and 4.12 ± 0.37 nmol/min/mg protein for WT, C121S, D355S, D355E, R357S, R363S, R363K, G359S, and R357S/R363S, respectively. To exclude that mutant proteins presented any major alteration in their tertiary structure, fluorescence analysis was performed using a Perkin-Elmer LS-5B fluorimeter. Emission spectra were recorded between 290 and 440 nm in 5 mm Tris, pH 7.4, with excitation wavelength set at 280 nm. Protein concentration was 0.02 mg/ml. No differences were observed when the spectra of recombinant WT and MAT mutants were compared. MATS-nitrosylation was measured according to the procedure described by Ruiz et al. (10Ruiz F. Corrales F.J. Miqueo C. Mato J.M. Hepatology. 1998; 28: 1051-1057Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Briefly, samples of purified recombinant MAT (0.4 mg/ml) were incubated withS-nitrosoglutathione (GSNO) at 37 °C for 10 min. The excess GSNO was removed by DEAE chromatography.S-Nitrosylated proteins were incubated with 2.2 mm HgCl2, and the amount of NO released was measured by the chemiluminescence derived from its reaction with ozone using a Sievers NOA 280 nitric oxide analyzer. Standard curves were obtained with known concentrations of GSNO. MAT activity was measured as described by Cabrero et al. (17Cabrero C. Puerta J. Alemany S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 170: 299-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) using saturating concentrations of the substrates, 5 mm methionine and 5 mm ATP, in the absence of any reducing agent. Samples of 2 × 106 hepatocytes, prepared as mentioned above, were washed twice in phosphate/saline buffer and homogenized by freezing and thawing in 10 mm Tris/HCl, 0.3 msucrose, and 1 mm EGTA, pH 7.5, containing 0.1% phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 0.1% benzamidine. Cytosol was obtained by centrifugation at 100,000 × g at 4 °C. Excess EGSNO was removed by DEAE chromatography on a 1-ml column (10Ruiz F. Corrales F.J. Miqueo C. Mato J.M. Hepatology. 1998; 28: 1051-1057Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), and the enzyme activity was measured. Samples of purified WT and mutant recombinant rat liver MAT were incubated for 10 min at 37 °C in the presence or absence of GSNO or peroxynitrite. After incubation, excess GSNO or peroxynitrite was removed by DEAE chromatography (10Ruiz F. Corrales F.J. Miqueo C. Mato J.M. Hepatology. 1998; 28: 1051-1057Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), and the enzyme activity was measured. GSNO and EGSNO were prepared according to Ruiz et al. (10Ruiz F. Corrales F.J. Miqueo C. Mato J.M. Hepatology. 1998; 28: 1051-1057Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Briefly, equimolar concentrations of an aqueous solution of NaNO2and a freshly prepared GSH or EGSH solution in 250 mm HCl and 0.1 m EDTA, pH 1.5, were mixed. The resulting mixture was incubated at room temperature for 5 min and then neutralized with NaOH. Peroxynitrite synthesis was carried out by the method described by Beckman et al. (18Beckman J.S. Chen J. Ischiropoulos H. Crow J.P. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 233: 229-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (961) Google Scholar) modified by Pannala et al.(19Pannala A.S. Rice-Evans C.A. Halliwell B. Singh S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 232: 164-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). Only freshly prepared solutions of GSNO, EGSNO, and peroxynitrite were used. Cytosolic nitrite and nitrate (NOx) were reduced to NO by incubation with 1 N HCl containing 50 mm VCl3 (10Ruiz F. Corrales F.J. Miqueo C. Mato J.M. Hepatology. 1998; 28: 1051-1057Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The resulting NO was measured by the chemiluminescence derived from its reaction with ozone using a Sievers NOA 280 nitric oxide analyzer (10Ruiz F. Corrales F.J. Miqueo C. Mato J.M. Hepatology. 1998; 28: 1051-1057Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The effect of NO on the content of AdoMet was examined in isolated rat hepatocytes. Incubation of rat hepatocytes with the cell-permeable NO donor EGSNO (5 mm) induced a time-dependent reduction of the cellular AdoMet content (Fig. 1). Within 15 min of the addition of EGSNO to the incubation medium, the hepatocyte content of AdoMet decreased about 80%, i.e. from 1.03 ± 0.08 nmol of AdoMet/106 cells in control hepatocytes to 0.22 ± 0.035 nmol of AdoMet/106 cells in hepatocytes treated with the NO donor (Fig. 1). The reversibility of the depletion of AdoMet by EGSNO in isolated rat hepatocytes was examined by removing the NO donor from the incubation medium and resuspending the cells in fresh buffer without EGSNO (Fig. 1). Within 15 min of the removal of the NO donor and resuspension of the cells in fresh medium without EGSNO, cellular AdoMet content returned close to that of untreated hepatocytes (Fig. 1). When hepatocytes were maintained in the presence of the NO donor, the depletion of the cellular content of AdoMet was maintained during the next 15 min (Fig.1). As previously demonstrated (10Ruiz F. Corrales F.J. Miqueo C. Mato J.M. Hepatology. 1998; 28: 1051-1057Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), incubation with EGSNO within 15 min induced the inactivation of MAT (from 36.4 ± 0.5 pmol/min/mg of protein in control hepatocytes to 10.95 ± 2.8 pmol/min/mg of protein in the presence of 5 mm EGSNO). Removal of the NO donor from the incubation medium returned MAT activity to values similar to those of the untreated hepatocytes (29.18 ± 1.1 pmol/min/mg of protein) within 15 min. We next analyzed whether the effect of EGSNO on AdoMet content in hepatocytes was dose-dependent (Fig.2). The addition of EGSNO (0.5–5 mm) to isolated rat hepatocytes induced a dose-dependent accumulation of NOx, which led to a progressive depletion of AdoMet content (Fig. 2). Significant reduction of the AdoMet content in hepatocytes was already observed at 1 mm EGSNO, a condition where intracellular NOx increased about 5-fold. The addition of EGSNO to isolated rat hepatocytes induced, as described previously (10Ruiz F. Corrales F.J. Miqueo C. Mato J.M. Hepatology. 1998; 28: 1051-1057Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), a dose-dependent inactivation of MAT activity (data not shown). S-Nitrosylation of recombinant WT rat liver enzyme and mutants of MAT was measured after reaction with various concentrations of GSNO (5–100 μm). In WT rat liver, MAT incubation for 10 min with 100 μm GSNO produced the S-nitrosylation of about 1.3 thiol residues/enzyme subunit (Fig. 3). Incubation with GSNO also induced the inactivation of the enzyme. As shown in Fig. 4, there is a close inverse correlation between the extent of S-nitrosylation and loss of activity induced by GSNO (r = 0.95,p < 0.001). Incorporation of 1 mol of SNO/mol of MAT subunit led to about 80% inactivation of MAT. MaximalS-nitrosylation and inactivation were obtained within 10 min of incubation with GSNO (data not shown). We have previously shown (8Avila M.A. Mingorance J. Martı́nez-Chantar M.L. Casado M. Martı́n-Sanz P. Boscá L. Mato J.M. Hepatology. 1997; 25: 391-396PubMed Google Scholar) that replacement of cysteine 121 by serine (referred to as C121S) prevented the ability of NO donors to inactivate hepatic MAT. Consistently, incubation of C121S with GSNO (5–100 μm) resulted in the incorporation of only about 0.2 mol of (SNO) per mol of MAT subunit. The mechanism of protein S-nitrosylation has been recently proposed (11Stamler J.S. Toone E.J. Lipton S.A. Sucher N.J. Neuron. 1997; 18: 691-696Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (610) Google Scholar) to involve an acid-base-catalyzed SNO/SH exchange reaction, where the target cysteine residue is located next to basic and acid amino acids. In human and rat liver MAT, cysteine 121 is not flanked by acid and basic amino acids but by glutamine and valine (20Horikawa S. Ishikawa M. Ozasa H. Tsukada K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 184: 497-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 21Alvarez L. Asunción M. Corrales F. Pajares M.A. Mato J.M. FEBS Lett. 1991; 290: 142-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 22Alvarez L. Corrales F. Martı́n-Duce A. Mato J.M. Biochem. J. 1993; 293: 481-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). However, when the three-dimensional structure of liver MAT is analyzed, one residue of aspartic acid (Asp-355) and two residues of arginine (Arg-357, Arg-363) are all found in the vicinity of the sulfur group of cysteine 121 (Fig. 5). Replacement of aspartic acid 355 by serine (D355S) markedly reduced theS-nitrosylation of the mutant enzyme in the presence of GSNO (Fig. 3). Replacement of arginine 357 (R357S) or of arginine 363 (R363S) by serine led also to a marked reduction of theS-nitrosylation of the mutant enzyme as compared with the WT liver MAT (Fig. 3). Further, a double mutant, where arginine 357 and arginine 363 were both replaced by serine (R357S/R363S) incorporated only about 0.4 mol of SNO/mol of MAT subunit after incubation with 100 μm GSNO (Fig. 3). As negative controls, we have replaced arginine 363 by lysine (R363K) and aspartic acid 355 by glutamic acid (D355E) and observed that these conservative changes had no effect on the S-nitrosylation of the mutant enzymes by GSNO as compared with the WT liver MAT. Fig. 3 shows the results obtained with the mutant enzyme R363K; similar results were observed with the mutant enzyme D355E (data not shown). As an additional control we have changed glycine 359, a non-charged residue that is separated by 5.3 Å from the thiol group of cysteine 121, to serine (G359S) and observed that this mutation had no effect on the S-nitrosylation of the mutant enzyme by GSNO (data not shown). These controls provide evidence that the effects on MAT S-nitrosylation of changing arginine 357, arginine 363, or aspartic acid 355 to serine are due to loss of charge and not to alterations in the position of cysteine 121. Finally, similarly to the WT recombinant MAT, incubation of mutants D355S, D355E, R357S, R363S, R363K, G359S, and R357S/R363S with millimolar concentrations of GSNO resulted in the incorporation of about 10 mol of SNO/mol of MAT subunit, indicating that all cysteine residues present in the protein (21Alvarez L. Asunción M. Corrales F. Pajares M.A. Mato J.M. FEBS Lett. 1991; 290: 142-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) were S-nitrosylated.Figure 4Correlation between extent of MAT S-nitrosylation and loss of activity. MAT purified from E. coli transformed with WT mutant cDNA was incubated in the presence of various concentrations of GSNO (5–100 μm) for 10 min at 37 °C. The enzyme activity and the formation of SNO groups were then determined as described under “Experimental Procedures.” MAT activity is expressed as the percent of activity remaining after treatment with GSNO.

The structural detail of the microenvironment of cysteine 121 is based on a model structure for the rat liver MAT subunit published previously (32Sánchez-Góngora E. Ruiz F. Mingorance J. An W. Corrales F.J. Mato J.M. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 1013-1019Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) using the data available for the x-ray crystal structure of E. coli MAT (33Takusagawa F. Kamitori S.

Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 2586-2596Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). This figure was prepared with Ras Mol (35.Sayle, R. (1993–1995) Ras Win Molecular Graphics, Windows version 2.6.Google Scholar). The position of cysteine 121 (C121), arginine 357 (R357), arginine 363 (R363), and aspartic acid 355 (D355) are indicated. According to this model, the distances between the SH group of cysteine 121 and the guanidino groups of arginine 357 and arginine 363 are 3.3 and 4.4 Å, respectively. The distance between the SH group of cysteine 121 and the γ-COOH of aspartic acid 355 is 4.9 Å.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) We next analyzed whether these mutants showing impaired MATS-nitrosylation were resistant to GSNO-induced enzyme inactivation. Whereas incubation of the WT recombinant enzyme with 50 μm GSNO led to 70% reduction of the enzyme activity, replacement of cysteine 121 by a serine residue prevented the ability of GSNO to inactivate liver MAT (Fig. 6). Replacement of aspartic acid 355, arginine 357, or arginine 363 by serine led to a marked reduction of the ability of GSNO to inactivate liver MAT (Fig. 6). Further, replacement of both arginine 357 and arginine 363 by serine was as effective as the substitution of cysteine 121 by serine to prevent GSNO-induced MAT inactivation (Fig.6). On the contrary, replacement of arginine 363 by lysine, aspartic acid 355 by glutamic acid, or glycine 359 by serine did not affect the ability of GSNO to inactivate liver MAT. Fig. 6 shows the results obtained with the mutant enzyme R363K; similar results were observed with the mutant enzymes D355E and G359S (data not shown). Incubation of WT liver MAT for 10 min with 50 μmperoxynitrite also induced the inactivation of the enzyme (Fig.7). As expected, incubation of WT liver MAT with peroxynitrite did not result in the S-nitrosylation of the enzyme (data not shown). Whereas replacement of cysteine 121 by serine prevented the ability of peroxynitrite to inactivate liver MAT, replacement of aspartic acid 355 or arginine 363 by serine, or replacement of both arginine 357 and arginine 363 by serine had no effect on the inactivation of the enzyme by peroxynitrite (Fig. 7). These results indicate that whereas arginine 357, arginine 363, and aspartic acid 355 are needed for transnitrosation of cysteine 121, these residues are unneeded for the interaction of this thiol with peroxynitrite. Moreover, these results provide further evidence that in these mutants cysteine 121 is not buried in the protein. Our results indicate that NO or related molecules can regulate AdoMet content in hepatocytes via reversible NO-mediatedS-nitrosylation and inactivation of hepatic MAT. An increase in the hepatic levels of NO induces a rapid S-nitrosylation and inactivation of hepatic MAT (10Ruiz F. Corrales F.J. Miqueo C. Mato J.M. Hepatology. 1998; 28: 1051-1057Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), which leads to a rapid depletion of the AdoMet content. Conversely, the elimination of the NO source leads to the rapid denitrosylation and activation of hepatic MAT (10Ruiz F. Corrales F.J. Miqueo C. Mato J.M. Hepatology. 1998; 28: 1051-1057Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) and to the rapid increase of the AdoMet content. This agrees with the observation that the half-life of hepatic AdoMet is only about 5 min (6Finkelstein J.D. J. Nutr. Biochem. 1990; 1: 228-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (1076) Google Scholar). Further, our results indicate that a moderate increase in the hepatocyte levels of NO, as observed during incubation with 1 mm EGSNO, is sufficient to have a significant effect on AdoMet content. We have previously established (9Avila M.A. Carretero M.V. Rodrı́guez E.N. Mato J.M. Gastroenterology. 1998; 114: 364-371Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) that in rat hepatocytes kept under low oxygen levels MAT is inactivated. Further we also found that in rat hepatocytes hypoxia induced the expression of NO synthase and that the inactivation of MAT during hypoxia was prevented by the NO synthase inhibitorN G-monomethyl-l-arginine methyl ester (9Avila M.A. Carretero M.V. Rodrı́guez E.N. Mato J.M. Gastroenterology. 1998; 114: 364-371Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Elevated levels of NO or related molecules may contribute to the abnormal metabolism of methionine in patients with liver cirrhosis. Hypermethioninemia, reduced hepatic MAT activity, and decreased content of liver AdoMet have been detected in patients with liver cirrhosis and/or in experimental models of chronic liver injury (23Kinsell L.W.

In patients with liver cirrhosis and in experimental models of chronic liver disorders serum levels of NOx are elevated (29Freeswick P.D. Geller D.A. Lancaster J.R. Billiar T.R. Arias I.M. Boyer J.L.

Vilardell F. Mourelle M. Moncada S. Hepatology. 1993; 18: 1139-1143Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar). The serum NOx levels in patients with liver cirrhosis have been reported to increase up to 10-fold (from 3 μm in control subjects to 34 μm in cirrhosis) (30Guarner C. Soriano G. Tomás A. Bulbena O. Novella M.T. Balanzo J. Vilardell F. Mourelle M. Moncada S. Hepatology. 1993; 18: 1139-1143Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar). Although it is not known what may be the concentration of NOx in the cirrhotic liver, the present results indicate that 50 μm GSNO inactivate liver MAT by about 60%. These data are evidence for a pathophysiological interruption of AdoMet metabolism by NO. NO inhibits many enzymes by S-nitrosylation of active site and regulatory thiols (31Stamler J.S. Cell. 1994; 78: 931-936Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1627) Google Scholar). It is not yet known, however, what structural factors govern the modification of a specific protein cysteine residue by NO. An acid-base-catalyzed SNO/SH exchange reaction, where the target cysteine residue is located next to basic and acid amino acids, has been recently proposed (11Stamler J.S. Toone E.J. Lipton S.A. Sucher N.J. Neuron. 1997; 18: 691-696Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (610) Google Scholar). The NO-mediated inactivation of hepatic MAT appears to occur throughS-nitrosylation of the residue of cysteine 121 of the enzyme (8Avila M.A. Mingorance J. Martı́nez-Chantar M.L. Casado M. Martı́n-Sanz P. Boscá L. Mato J.M. Hepatology. 1997; 25: 391-396PubMed Google Scholar, 10Ruiz F. Corrales F.J. Miqueo C. Mato J.M. Hepatology. 1998; 28: 1051-1057Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Our results indicate that the substitution of cysteine 121 by serine prevents MAT S-nitrosylation and inactivation by GSNO. Further we show that there is a close inverse correlation between the extent of S-nitrosylation and loss of activity. Cysteine 121 is localized at a “flexible loop” over the active site cleft of MAT (32Sánchez-Góngora E. Ruiz F. Mingorance J. An W. Corrales F.J. Mato J.M. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 1013-1019Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 33Takusagawa F. Kamitori S. Misaki S. Markham G.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 136-147Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 34Takusagawa F. Kamitori S. Markham G.D. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 2586-2596Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). This loop can adopt two different conformations, open and closed, and it has been proposed that in the closed conformation prevents the entrance of the substrates to the active site (34Takusagawa F. Kamitori S. Markham G.D. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 2586-2596Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Cysteine 121 is not essential for activity because the substitution of this amino acid residue by serine has no effect on MAT activity (15Mingorance J. Alvarez L. Sánchez-Góngora E. Mato J.M. Pajares M.A. Biochem. J. 1996; 315: 761-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The present results suggest that formation of a SNO group in cysteine 121 induces a conformational change in the “flexible loop” making less accessible the active site of the enzyme for the substrates, probably by switching the loop into the closed conformation. Replacement of the acidic amino acid (Asp-355) or of any of the two basic amino acids (Arg-357, Arg-363) localized in the proximity of cysteine 121 by serine markedly reduced the capacity of GSNO toS-nitrosylate and inactivate liver MAT. Further, our results indicate that GSNO-induced MAT S-nitrosylation and inactivation are greatly prevented in a double mutant enzyme where arginine 357 and arginine 363 were both replaced by serine. When the changes did not involve loss of charge (arginine 363 by lysine and aspartic acid 355 by glutamic acid) these mutations had no effect on the S-nitrosylation and inactivation of the mutant enzymes by GSNO. Our results also indicate that the change of a non-charged amino acid (glycine 359) in the vicinity of cysteine 121 by serine did not affect S-nitrosylation and inactivation of the mutant enzyme by GSNO. We also show that peroxynitrite-induced MAT inactivation involves the reaction of this oxidizing agent with cysteine 121. In this case, however, replacement of arginine 357, arginine 363, or aspartic acid 355 by serine did not affect peroxynitrite-induced MAT inactivation. These results indicate that the decreased GSNO-mediated MAT S-nitrosylation and inactivation seen following replacement of acidic and basic residues in the vicinity of cysteine 121 with serine are because of loss of charge and are not because of structural changes that alter the position or otherwise protect the thiol. One possible explanation of these findings is that the function of the guanidino groups of arginine 357 and arginine 363 may be to facilitate the deprotonation of the sulfur group of cysteine 121 (Fig. 8). This will increase the nucleophilicity of cysteine 121 (by lowering its pK a) and consequently facilitate the nitrosylation of its sulfur group. The function of the γ-COOH group of aspartic acid 355 may be to facilitate the protonation of GSNO and, accordingly, facilitate the donation of its NO group. These results provide the first experimental evidence that, as proposed by Stamler et al. (11Stamler J.S. Toone E.J. Lipton S.A. Sucher N.J. Neuron. 1997; 18: 691-696Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (610) Google Scholar), the S-nitrosylation of protein thiol residues is governed by the basic and acidic amino acids surrounding the target thiol. Recognition of this topology is likely to prove useful in identifying new targets of protein S-nitrosylation. We thank Prof. Manuel Martı́n Lomas and Dr. Dacil Zurita for the synthesis of EGSH."

In the present study, expression of calreticulin was analyzed in human peripheral blood T lymphocytes. Pulse-chase experiments in [35S]methionine-labeled T cell blasts showed that calreticulin was associated with several proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum and suggested that it was expressed at the cell surface. Indeed, the 60-kDa calreticulin was labeled by cell surface biotinylation and precipitated from the surface of activated T cells together with a protein with an apparent molecular mass of 46 kDa. Cell surface expression of calreticulin by activated T lymphocytes was further confirmed by immunofluorescence and flow cytometry, studies that showed that both CD8+ and CD4+ T cells expressed calreticulin in the plasma membrane. Low amounts of cell surface calreticulin were detected in resting T lymphocytes. By sequential immunoprecipitation using the conformation independent monoclonal antibody HC-10, we provided evidence that the cell surface 46-kDa protein co-precipitated with calreticulin is unfolded MHC I. These results show for the first time that after T cell activation, significant amounts of calreticulin are expressed on the T cell surface, where they are found in physical association with a pool of β2-free MHC class I molecules.

Kindle C.S. Hansen T.H. Solheim J.C. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 5404-5409PubMed Google Scholar). Given that calreticulin displays multiple functions and has long been associated with several chronic diseases (31Sontheimer R.D. Nguyen T.Q. Cheng S.T. Lieu T.S. Capra D. J. Invest. Med. 1995; 43: 362-370PubMed Google Scholar, 32Coppolino M.G. Dedhar S. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1998; 30: 553-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), we undertook a study of calreticulin expression on human peripheral blood T lymphocytes to gain new insights into possible biological functions of this molecular chaperone. In the present study, we report the finding that calreticulin is expressed at the cell surface of activated human peripheral blood T lymphocytes, where it is physically associated with a pool of unfolded MHC class I molecules.RESULTSActivated human PBLs were metabolically labeled with [35S]methionine for 15 min and chased in methionine-supplemented media at different times. Brij 96 detergent lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-calreticulin Abs, and the immunoprecipitates were analyzed by SDS/PAGE. Numerous ER proteins co-precipitated with the 60-kDa calreticulin at time 0 after the 15-min pulse (Fig. 1). Among those, several have been previously identified as transporter-associated protein (70–72 kDa), tapasin (48 kDa), and MHC class I (46 kDa) (21Ortmann B. Copeman J. Lehner P.J. Sadasivan B. Herberg J.A. Grandea A.G. Riddell S.R. Tampé R. Spies T. Trowsdale J. Cresswell P. Science. 1997; 277: 1306-1309Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). Additional bands corresponding to unidentified proteins of ∼97, 50, 42, and 20 kDa were also visible. Interestingly, most of the pulse-labeled proteins, including calreticulin, rapidly disappeared 1 h after the initial pulse, with the marked exception of the 46-kDa band. Thus, 4 h after the pulse, although barely detectable labeled calreticulin was observed, a strong 46-kDa labeled protein was still co-precipitated by anti-calreticulin Abs (Fig. 1). Four h after the initial pulse, all proteins associated with calreticulin that are targeted to the cell surface would have reached the plasma membrane unless they were endocytosed and/or degraded. Among these, the survival of surface MHC class I molecules in activated human T cells is known to be increased (39Monos D.S. Cooper H.L. J. Immunol. 1983; 131: 341-346PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we suspected that newly synthesized “unlabeled” calreticulin was present in the cell surface of activated T cells in association with the mature 46-kDa MHC class I heavy chain.To address this question, resting and activated human PBLs were cell surface-labeled with biotin, lysed in Brij 96, and immunoprecipitated with the PA3–900 and W6/32 Abs. PA3–900 immunoprecipitated the 60-kDa calreticulin from lysates of biotinylated resting and activated PBLs (Fig. 2 A). The amount of precipitated calreticulin was, however, approximately 3-fold higher in activated PBLs. To note, a protein of 46 kDa similar to the one immunoprecipitated by W6/32 Abs, which recognize mature β2m-associated MHC I, was again co-precipitated with calreticulin in activated but not resting PBLs (Fig. 2 A). These results provided evidence that the ER resident chaperone calreticulin was expressed in the cell surface of human PBLs, that its expression increased after T cell activation, and that it was associated with a 46-kDa protein corresponding to the mobility of the MHC I heavy chain. The use of more stringent conditions during the cell lysis procedure (i.e. 2% Triton X-100), although decreasing markedly the amount of the co-precipitated 46-kDa protein, did not completely disrupt the association (Fig. 2 B). The observed difference between detergents did not reflect less protein extraction by Triton X-100, as both detergents extracted similar amounts of calreticulin (PA3–900 Ab) and MHC I heavy chain (W6/32 Ab). These results suggest that this association might be of physiological importance and rules out the possibility that the co-precipitation of the 46-kDa protein with the PA3–900 Ab is the consequence of an artifact resulting from cross-reactivity. It should be emphasized that there was some variation in the amount of the 46-kDa protein co-precipitated with calreticulin between the individuals studied.Calreticulin or calreticulin-like proteins have been described in almost every compartment of the cell. Recent reports have shown that human T cells express receptors for the C1q protein and that one of those receptors (cC1q-R) shows homology with calreticulin (40Chen A. Gaddipati S. Hong Y. Volkman D.J. Peerschke E.I.B. Ghrbrehiwet B. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 1430-1440PubMed Google Scholar, 41Stuart G.R. Lynch N.J. Lu J. Geick A. Moffatt B.E. Sim R.B. Schwaeble W.J. Immunopharmacology. 1997; 38: 73-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). To rule out the possibility that our PA3–900 antibody was recognizing the cC1q receptor, we performed depletion experiments. As shown in Fig.3, depletion of T cell surface calreticulin by four rounds of immunoprecipitation with the PA3–900 Ab did not abolish immunoprecipitation of the cC1q receptor. These data provide evidence that the calreticulin expressed in the surface of activated human T lymphocytes is apparently different from the C1q receptor. Next, we wanted to rule out the possibility that the calreticulin we were detecting on the cell surface of human PBLs could be result of intracellular biotinylation because of background labeling during the handling of the cells. Using activated human PBLs, immunoprecipitation of Brij 96 cell lysates from cell surface-biotinylated cells allowed the detection of cell surface-expressed molecules, such as calreticulin, but not of intracellular molecules such as the protein-tyrosine kinase FYN and the protein-tyrosine phosphatase SHP-1 (Fig.4, left panel). On the contrary, immunoprecipitation of biotinylated Brij 96 cell lysates allowed the detection of both sets of molecules, together with a number of co-precipitated proteins (Fig. 4, right panel). Interestingly, antibodies against the intracellular tyrosine kinase FYN were able to co-precipitate a strong band of similar mobility to the MHC class I heavy chain (Fig. 4, right panel).Figure 3The anti-calreticulin Ab PA3–900 does not recognize the C1q receptor. Five-day-activated human PBLs (20 × 106 cells) were surface-biotinylated and solubilized as indicated in the legend of Fig. 2. The cell lysate was subjected to four rounds of immunoprecipitation with PA3–900 and two additional rounds with beads, followed by immunoprecipitation with anti-C1q-R serum. Precipitates were boiled in 1% SDS and separated on a 12% SDS/PAGE under nondenaturing conditions. Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose filters, and biotinylated proteins were visualized by ECL. Calreticulin (CRT) is indicated by an arrow. An asterisk indicates the C1q receptor.

Five-day-activated human PBLs were cell surface-biotinylated and lysed in Brij 96 (left) or lysed in Brij 96 (right), and cell lysates were biotinylated as indicated under “Experimental Procedures.” Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with antibodies against FYN, SHP-1, and calreticulin (CRT). Precipitates were boiled in 1% SDS and separated on 10% SDS/PAGE under nondenaturing conditions.

For that purpose, cytospins of resting and activated human PBLs were stained with PA3–900 followed by a F(ab′)2 fraction of swine anti-rabbit fluorescein isothiocyanate conjugated Ab to avoid nonspecific binding to Fc receptors in activated T cells. The results demonstrated a faint cell surface expression of calreticulin in resting PBLs that markedly increased in activated T cells (Fig.5 A), which is in agreement with the immunoprecipitation results (Fig. 2). Permeabilized PBLs, either resting or activated, showed a conspicuous cytoplasmic staining (data not shown). To determine whether calreticulin was differentially expressed by the two major peripheral blood T cell subsets, two color flow cytometry studies were performed. The results showed that both CD8+ and CD4+ activated T cells expressed calreticulin at similar levels (Fig. 5 B).Figure 5Immunofluorescence identification of cell surface calreticulin.

Dotted lines represent background staining.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Finally, we wanted to confirm the identity of the 46-kDa protein co-precipitated with calreticulin. Because the W6/32 Ab was unable to co-precipitate a protein of similar mobility with calreticulin, we decided to include in our studies the conformation-independent Ab HC-10, which detects β2m-free MHC class I molecules. As shown in Fig. 6 A, calreticulin Abs were able again to co-precipitate low but significant amounts of a protein with 46 kDa. Re-precipitation of the primary immunoprecipitates with HC-10 demonstrated that the 46-kDa protein co-precipitating with calreticulin was indeed the MHC class I heavy chain (Fig.6 B). Immunodetection using the HC-10 Ab further confirmed that the 46-kDa band co-precipitating with calreticulin corresponds to the MHC class I heavy chain (data not shown). On the other hand, HC-10 but not W6/32 Abs were able to co-precipitate a protein of the same mobility as calreticulin from the surface of activated human PBLs (Fig.6 A). Re-precipitation of the primary immunoprecipitates with the PA3–900 Ab confirmed that calreticulin could be re-precipitated from HC-10 but not W6/32 primary immunoprecipitates (Fig.6 C), therefore demonstrating that calreticulin is associated with a pool of unfolded β2m-free MHC class I molecules on the cell surface of activated human PBLs.Figure 6Calreticulin (CRT) associates with unfolded MHC class I molecules on the surface of activated human PBLs. Five-day-activated human PBLs were surface-biotinylated and solubilized as indicated in the legend to Fig.2. Lysates corresponding to 107 cells were immunoprecipitated with beads (None), with W6/32 Abs (that recognize β2m-associated MHC class I molecules), with HC-10 Abs (that recognize β2m-free unfolded MHC class I molecules), and with PA3–900 Abs. Primary immunoprecipitates were boiled in 1% SDS, 20% of the sample separated on 7.5% SDS/PAGE under nondenaturing conditions, and proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose filters. Biotinylated proteins were visualized by ECL (A). The remaining immunoprecipitates were denatured in 2% SDS and re-precipitated with either HC-10 (B) or PA3–900 (C). Re-precipitates were boiled in 1% SDS, and aliquots were separated in 7.5% SDS/PAGE under nondenaturing conditions. Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose filters, and biotinylated proteins were visualized by ECL+. Calreticulin and MHC class I heavy chain are indicated by arrows.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)DISCUSSIONRecent studies on calreticulin are disclosing the key role played by this molecular chaperone in the folding and assembly of MHC class I molecules in the ER (19Sadasivan B.

However, a number of studies indicate that calreticulin is involved in a number of biochemical and physiological functions unrelated with its ER chaperone role. These studies have shown that calreticulin can be found in different locations within the cell, from the nucleus to the plasma membrane of several cell lines (reviewed in Ref. 31Sontheimer R.D. Nguyen T.Q. Cheng S.T. Lieu T.S. Capra D. J. Invest. Med. 1995; 43: 362-370PubMed Google Scholar). How calreticulin can escape the ER retention mechanisms and move into the cytoplasm, nucleus, or plasma membrane is an enigma that challenges current biology. In addition, calreticulin is thought to be involved in a number of diseases, all sharing an immunological basis (32Coppolino M.G. Dedhar S. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1998; 30: 553-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 42McCauliffe D.P. Sontheimer R.D. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1993; 100: 73-79Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). All these findings have led to the suggestion that calreticulin may represent a family of highly homologous proteins.The present study addressed the characterization of calreticulin expression in human peripheral blood T lymphocytes. Our interest in studying calreticulin relies 1) on our previous work demonstrating that T lymphocytes and classical MHC class I molecules play a regulatory role in tissue damage under excessive iron accumulation caused by a primary defect in an MHC class I like molecule (reviewed in Ref. 43de Sousa M. Porto G. J. Hepatol. 1998; 28: 1-7Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and 2) that calreticulin has also been described as an iron-binding protein (44Conrad M.E. Umbreit J.N. Moore E.G. Gastroenterology. 1993; 104: 1700-1704Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The few studies of calreticulin in human T lymphocytes have shown that the levels of calreticulin mRNA and protein increase after mitogenic stimulation and that calreticulin is a constituent of lytic granules in lymphokine-activated killer cells (4Dupuis M. Schaerer E. Krause K.H. Tschopp J. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 177: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar,45Burns K. Helgason C.D. Bleackley R.C. Michalak M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19039-19042Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The present results extend these studies by showing that calreticulin is expressed on the plasma membrane of peripheral blood human T lymphocytes and that cell surface expression increases after T cell activation.Previous studies have shown that calreticulin or calreticulin-like molecules are expressed on the plasma membrane of transformed cell lines of different origin. These studies raised the question of how calreticulin can be expressed at the cell surface because it lacks a transmembrane domain. A likely explanation is that cell surface calreticulin is anchored to other(s) surface molecules (46Zhu Q. Zelinka P. White T. Tanzer M.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 232: 354-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 47Sim R.B. Moestrup S.K. Stuart G.R. Lynch N.J. Lu J. Schwaeble W.J. Malhotra R. Immunobiology. 1998; 199: 208-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). By cell surface biotinylation and immunoprecipitation, we have provided evidence that calreticulin co-precipitates with several T cell surface molecules, and we have identified MHC class I molecules as one of these T cell surface molecules. Escape of ER resident molecular chaperones to the plasma membrane has previously been reported in several cell types including thymic lymphoma cells (24Wiest D.L. Bhandoola A. Punt J. Kreibich G. McKean D. Singer A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1884-1889Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 27Zhang J. Salojin K. Gao J.X. Cameron M. Geisler C. Delovitch T.L. J.

Sontheimer R.D. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1993; 100: 73-79Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). It has been argued that this may result from changes in the relative availability of KDEL receptors present in post-ER compartments and known to be involved in the retrograde transport of proteins containing this C-terminal retrieval sequence (48Townsley F.M. Wilson D.W. Pelham H.R. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2821-2829Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 49Griffiths G. Ericsson M. Krinjnse-Locker J. Nilsson T. Goud B. Soling H.D. Tang B.L. Wong S.H.

Commun. 1997; 240: 36-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Because we have detected calreticulin on the surface of normal human T lymphocytes, it is not unlikely to anticipate that other KDEL-containing ER chaperones such as BiP and GRP94 could also be expressed at the T cell surface as well.The association of calreticulin with MHC class I molecules on the surface of activated human T cells is intriguing considering the properties displayed by these polymorphic molecules. T cell surface MHC class I molecules are subjected to spontaneous cycles of endocytosis/re-expression via coated pits (39Monos D.S. Cooper H.L. J. Immunol. 1983; 131: 341-346PubMed Google Scholar, 51Machy P. Barbet J. Leserman L.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 4148-4152Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 52Tse D.B.

Nature. 1987; 328: 724-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Moreover, endocytosed β2m-associated MHC class I molecules are re-expressed at the cell surface as β2m-free unfolded MHC class I molecules (54DeMaria S. Schwab R. Bushkin Y. Cell Immunol. 1992; 142: 103-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 55Pickl W.F. Holter W. Stöckl J. Majdic O. Knapp W. Immunology. 1996; 88: 104-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). On the other hand, recent studies have shown that calreticulin preferentially associates with unfolded MHC class I molecules in the ER and that the oligosaccharide moiety in the α1 domain and a residue within the α3 domain are critical for interaction with calreticulin (29Zhang Q. Salter R.D. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 831-837PubMed Google Scholar, 30Harris M.R. Yu Y.Y.L. Kindle C.S. Hansen T.H. Solheim J.C. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 5404-5409PubMed Google Scholar). Considering that the calreticulin-MHC I association was de"

In mammalian fibroblasts and epithelial cells, exocytic vesicles mobilized by Ca2+ were identified as lysosomes. Here we show that elevation in intracellular cAMP potentiates Ca2+-dependent exocytosis of lysosomes in normal rat kidney fibroblasts. The process can be modulated by the heterotrimeric G proteins Gs and Gi, consistent with activation or inhibition of adenylyl cyclase. Normal rat kidney cell stimulation with isoproterenol, a β-adrenergic agonist that activates adenylyl cyclase, enhances Ca2+-dependent lysosome exocytosis and cell invasion by Trypanosoma cruzi, a process that involves parasite-induced [Ca2+]i transients and fusion of host cell lysosomes with the plasma membrane. Similarly to what is observed for T. cruzi invasion, the actin cytoskeleton acts as a barrier for Ca2+-induced lysosomal exocytosis. In addition, infective stages of T. cruzi trigger elevation in host cell cAMP levels, whereas no effect is observed with noninfective forms of the parasite. These findings demonstrate that cAMP regulates lysosomal exocytosis triggered by Ca2+ and a parasite/host cell interaction known to involve Ca2+-dependent lysosomal fusion.

Ca2+-regulated exocytosis has been traditionally regarded as a specialized process present in only a few cell types. Recently, however, evidence has been accumulating indicating that it is a ubiquitous process observed in a variety of animal cells (1Girod R. Popov S. Alder J. Zheng J.Q. Lohof A. Poo M.M. J.

A previous study from our laboratory showed that between 10 and 20% of conventional lysosomes in fibroblasts and epithelial cells fuse with the plasma membrane and release their contents upon elevation of the intracellular free Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) (6Rodriguez A. Webster P. Ortego J. Andrews N.W. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 93-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). Lysosome exocytosis is similar to other well characterized forms of Ca2+-regulated exocytosis in specialized cells, in the sense that it is ATP and temperature-dependent and requires micromolar levels of [Ca2+]i (6Rodriguez A. Webster P. Ortego J. Andrews N.W. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 93-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). These findings are consistent with recent capacitance measurements in Chinese hamster ovary cells, which showed that vesicles in the size range of lysosomes (0.4–1.5 μm) fuse with the plasma membrane in response to 6–20 μm [Ca2+]i (3Ninomiya Y. Kisimoto T. Miyashita Y. Kasai H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17751-17754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Although the physiological function of regulated lysosome exocytosis is unclear, an intriguing possibility is that it may participate in plasma membrane resealing, a process that requires Ca2+ and exocytosis (5McNeil P.L. Steinhardt R.A. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 1-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). Several studies describe accumulation and fusion of intracellular vesicles at the sites of membrane injury (7Steinhardt R.A. Bi G. Alderton J.M.

Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1737-1745Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar), the exact identity of these vesicles has remained obscure. The evidence presented here and in our previous work (6Rodriguez A. Webster P. Ortego J. Andrews N.W. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 93-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar) strongly suggests that the vesicle population mobilized by Ca2+ and postulated to be involved in membrane repair may, at least in fibroblasts, correspond to conventional lysosomes. Another physiological process known to require mobilization and fusion of lysosomes with the plasma membrane is cell invasion by the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma cruzi. Several lines of evidence indicate that host cell lysosomes are required for cell invasion by this pathogen. The process involves a gradual recruitment of lysosomes to the parasite entry site, followed by lysosome fusion and formation of an intracellular vacuole, through which T. cruzi enters the cell (11Tardieux I.

Andrews N.W. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 349-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Cell invasion by T. cruzi is Ca2+-dependent, because it can be effectively blocked by loading the host cells with membrane-permeant Ca2+ chelators or by previously depleting intracellular Ca2+ stores. Trypomastigotes, the T. cruziinfective stages, are capable of triggering intracellular free Ca2+ transients in a variety of mammalian cell types (13Tardieux I. Nathanson M.H. Andrews N.W. J. Exp.

Although the mechanism responsible is incompletely understood, there have been several reports of potentiation of exocytosis by agents that elevate cytosolic cAMP in mammalian cells (15O'Sullivan A.J.

In this study, we investigated in parallel the effect of modulation in intracellular cAMP levels on Ca2+-dependent exocytosis of lysosomes and on cell invasion by T. cruzi. We demonstrate that cAMP levels regulate Ca2+-evoked lysosome exocytosis in NRK fibroblasts and that the stimulatory effect of cAMP on lysosome exocytosis can be further potentiated by microfilament disassembly, consistent with previous observations in other systems implicating the cortical actin cytoskeleton as an obstacle for exocytosis (20Koffer A.

The same pattern of regulation is observed on the levels of cell invasion by T. cruzi trypomastigotes, when the cells are stimulated by agonists that elevate or reduce intracellular cAMP. Exposure of NRK cells to the infective trypomastigote stages of T. cruziresults in elevated intracellular cAMP levels, an effect not observed with the noninfective epimastigote stages of the parasite. These findings reinforce previous observations indicating that similar mechanisms regulate lysosome exocytosis and T. cruziinvasion of mammalian cells. Forskolin, dideoxyforskolin, 3-isobutyl-1-methylxantine (IBMX), 1The abbreviations used are: IBMX, 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine; [Ca2+]i, intracellular free Ca2+ concentration; Gs, stimulatory heterotrimeric G protein; Gi, inhibitory heterotrimeric G protein; NRK, normal rat kidney; SLO, streptolysin O; 8-Br-cAMP, 8-bromo-cyclic AMP 8-Br-cAMP (sodium salt), isoproterenol, phalloidin, cytochalasin D, and protein G-Sepharose were obtained from Sigma; mastoparan and MDL-12,330A were from Calbiochem. Latranculin A was from Molecular Probes (Eugene, Oregon). Reduced streptolysin-O (SLO) was from Murex Diagnostics (Dartford, United Kingdom). NRK cells were grown at 37 °C with 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Confluent monolayers containing 6 × 104 cells/cm2 were used for all experiments. Cells were treated with 100 μm forskolin or dideoxyforskolin for 15 min at 37 °C or as indicated, with 4 μm isoproterenol for 15 min at 37 °C or as indicated, with 100 μm MDL-12,330A for 30 min at 37 °C or as indicated, with 500 μm 8-Br-cAMP and 500 μm IBMX for 15 min at 37 °C or as indicated, with 0.4 μg/ml cholera toxin overnight at 37 °C, with 20 or 40 μg/ml mastoparan for 15 min at 37 °C, with 2 μmcytochalasin D for 10 min at 37 °C, with 1 μmlatranculin A for 10 min at 37 °C, and with 10 μmphalloidin for 10 min at 37 °C. Confluent monolayers of NRK cells in 60-mm culture dishes were washed twice with 1 ml of ice-cold buffer A (20 mm Hepes, 110 mmNaCl, 5.4 mm KCl, 0.9 mmNa2HPO4, 10 mm MgCl2, 2 mm CaCl2, 11 mm glucose, pH 7.4) and incubated for 10 min at 4 °C with SLO at 0.5 units/ml in buffer A. Cells were washed once with 1 ml of ice-cold buffer B (20 mm Hepes, 100 mm potassium glutamate, 40 mm KCl, and 5 mm EGTA, pH 7.2) containing 2 mm MgATP and 5 mm free Mg2+ (added as MgCl2). 0.5 ml of buffer B with or without 1 μm Ca2+ was added to the cells at 37 °C for 10 min. The concentrations of free Mg2+ and Ca2+ were maintained using a Ca2+ or Mg2+/EGTA buffering system, calculated using the software developed by Foehr and Warchol (Ulm, Germany). Incubation buffer was collected for each sample and centrifuged for 5 min at 11,000 ×g before performing β-hexosaminidase activity assays. Total extracts were obtained by incubation of culture dishes with 0.5 ml of buffer B containing 1% Nonidet P-40, followed by a 5-min centrifugation of the extract at 11,000 ×g. For each sample, 350 ml of the incubation buffer was incubated for 15 min at 37 °C with 50 ml of 6 mm4-methyl-umbellyferyl-N-acetyl-β-d-glucosaminide in sodium citrate-phosphate buffer, pH 4.5. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 100 ml of 2 mNa2CO3, 1.1 m glycine, and the fluorescence was measured in a F-2000 spectrofluorimeter (Hitachi Instruments, Inc., Danbury, CT) at excitation 365 nm/emission 450 nm. To determine the total cellular content of β-hexosaminidase, cell extracts prepared as described above were diluted 1:10, and 350 ml was used for β-hexosaminidase activity assays. Confluent monolayers of NRK cells in 24-well dishes, prelabeled for 24 h with [3H]adenine (22 Ci/mmol, 5 μCi/ml), were incubated with the indicated drugs in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium 10% fetal calf serum at 37 °C, washed once with Hepes-buffered Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, and incubated for 15 min at 37 °C in the same medium containing 1 mm IBMX with or without 50 μm forskolin. Reactions were terminated by the addition of 1 ml/well of 5% trichloroacetic acid containing 1 mm ATP and 1 mm cAMP. Acid-soluble nucleotides were separated on ion-exchange columns as described previously (23Salomon Y. Londos C. Rodbell M. Anal. Biochem. 1974; 58: 541-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (3374) Google Scholar). In the mastoparan treatment experiments, [3H]adenine-labeled cells were permeabilized with SLO before exposure to 20 μg/ml mastoparan for 15 min at 37 °C. In the experiments with liveT. cruzi, [3H]adenine-labeled NRK cells plated in 6-well dishes were exposed to 5 × 107trypomastigotes or epimastigotes in 1 ml of Ringer's buffer (24Heuser J. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 855-864Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar) for 30 min at 37 °C. NRK cells were plated at a density of 2.5 × 104 cells/cm2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% fetal bovine serum on 12-mm round coverslips placed in 6-cm plastic tissue culture dishes and grown for 48 h at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. Coverslips with attached cells were washed briefly with Ringer's immediately before incubation for 30 min at 37 °C with 5 × 107 T. cruzi trypomastigotes/ml of Ringer's. Infected cells were washed and fixed in 2% (w/v) paraformaldehyde, phosphate-buffered saline, and the number of intracellular parasites was determined by immunofluorescence as described previously (11Tardieux I. Webster P. Ravesloot J. Boron W. Lunn J.A. Heuser J. Andrews N.W. Cell. 1992; 71: 1117-1130Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). To investigate whether Ca2+-dependent exocytosis of lysosomes in fibroblasts could also be potentiated by elevation in cytosolic cAMP levels, NRK cells were pretreated with forskolin, an activator of adenylyl cyclase, before permeabilization with SLO and detection of released β-hexosaminidase. As shown in Fig.1 a, 100 μmforskolin stimulates Ca2+-induced lysosomal exocytosis; an 82% increase in β-hexosaminidase release was observed after a 4-min exposure to 1 μm free Ca2+, with a 70% increase still detected after 10 min. The stimulatory effect of forskolin is dose-dependent (Fig. 1 b) and specific, because the inactive analog dideoxyforskolin has no effect (Fig. 1 c). We next investigated whether pretreatment of NRK cells with MDL-12,330A, an irreversible inhibitor of adenylyl cyclase (25Guellaen G. Mahu J.L. Mavier P. Berthelot P. Hanoune J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1977; 484: 465-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), affected Ca2+-dependent lysosomal exocytosis. Fig. 2 a shows that inhibition of adenylyl cyclase activity results in a dose-dependent reduction in β-hexosaminidase release from NRK cells after exposure to 1 μm Ca2+, reaching about 70% reduction at concentrations between 75 and 100 μm. To detect inhibition of adenylyl cyclase, intracellular cAMP levels were measured after forskolin stimulation. Treatment with 100 μmMDL-12,330A reduced intracellular cAMP levels in forskolin-stimulated NRK cells by 43% (Fig. 2 b). As an alternative method for increasing cytosolic levels of cAMP, NRK cells were exposed to the phosphodiesterase inhibitor IBMX (30Higashijima T. Uzu S. Nakajima T. Ross E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6491-6494Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), a treatment that also resulted in a dose-dependent increase in Ca2+-induced β-hexosaminidase release (Fig.3 a). To obtain direct evidence implicating cAMP in the potentiation of Ca2+-induced lysosomal exocytosis, NRK cells were incubated with 8-Br-cAMP, a membrane-permeant analog of cAMP. Cells were preincubated with IBMX to avoid degradation of 8-Br-cAMP during the assay (18Hansen S.T. Casanova J.E. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 677-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Under these conditions, 8-Br-cAMP enhanced Ca2+-induced β-hexosaminidase release in a dose-dependent fashion, reaching a 40% increase over the level induced by IBMX alone at 500 μm (Fig. 3 b). The addition of forskolin, IBMX, or 8-Br-cAMP to NRK cells in the absence of Ca2+ did not increase β-hexosaminidase release above base-line levels (Fig.3 c), indicating that elevated cytosolic cAMP has a regulatory role but is not sufficient to trigger exocytosis of lysosomes in NRK cells. Constitutive and regulated exocytic pathways are regulated by heterotrimeric G proteins in several cell types (18Hansen S.T. Casanova J.E. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 677-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar,26Pimplikar S.W. Simons K. Nature. 1993; 362: 456-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 27Vitale N. Gensse M. Chasserot-Golaz S. Aunis D. Bader M.F. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1996; 8: 1274-1285Crossref Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Gs and Gi can also regulate adenylyl cyclase, resulting in stimulation or inhibition of cAMP synthesis, respectively. In view of the results above, implicating intracellular cAMP levels on the regulation of lysosome exocytosis, we investigated whether the process could be regulated by heterotrimeric G proteins through stimulation of adenylyl cyclase. NRK cells were pretreated with cholera toxin, which ADP-ribosylates and activates the a subunit of Gs (28Stryer L. Bourne H.L. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1986; 2: 391-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar). After cholera toxin treatment, Ca2+-induced β-hexosaminidase release was elevated approximately 25% (Fig. 4 a), whereas the intracellular levels of cytosolic cAMP showed a significantly larger increase (Fig. 4 c). The reason for this discrepancy is unclear, but it may be a consequence of the activation of additional cholera toxin targets, such as XLas (29Kehlenbach R.H. Matthey J. Huttner W.B. Nature. 1994; 372: 804-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). To determine whether Gi, conversely, could regulate lysosomal exocytosis by inhibiting adenylyl cyclase, cells were pretreated with mastoparan, a tetradecapeptide that activates Gi but not Gs(30Higashijima T. Uzu S. Nakajima T. Ross E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6491-6494Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). NRK cells were permeabilized with SLO and incubated with mastoparan for 15 min before the addition of Ca2+-containing buffer. Ca2+-induced β-hexosaminidase release was reduced by approximately 35% in the mastoparan-treated cells (Fig. 4 b), consistent with the similarly reduced (40%) levels of cytosolic cAMP detected in response to forskolin after mastoparan treatment (Fig. 4 d). In agreement with the results shown above (Fig. 3 c), incubation of cells with either cholera toxin or mastoparan in the absence of Ca2+ had no significant effect on lysosomal exocytosis (Fig. 4, a–b). There is a significant amount of evidence suggesting that the cortical actin network must be rearranged to allow secretory vesicles to contact and fuse with the plasma membrane (22Morgan A. Essays Biochem. 1995; 30: 77-95PubMed Google Scholar, 31Muallem S. Kwiatkowska K. Xu X. Yin H.L. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 589-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). To investigate if the actin cytoskeleton also played a role in the regulation of lysosomal exocytosis, NRK cells were treated with agents that either disrupt (cytochalasin D, latranculin A) or stabilize (phalloidin) actin microfilaments, and Ca2+-induced β-hexosaminidase release was assessed. NRK cells were incubated or not with forskolin, followed by the addition of cytochalasin D or latranculin A before permeabilization with SLO and exposure to Ca2+-containing buffer. Cytochalasin D or latranculin A caused an enhancement of 60–70% for control cells and of 30–35% for forskolin-treated cells in the levels of Ca2+-induced β-hexosaminidase release (Fig.5 a). Treatment with these drugs had no significant effect on the base-line levels of β-hexosaminidase release observed in the absence of Ca2+stimulation (Fig. 5 a), indicating that microfilament disruption, similarly to cAMP elevation, is not sufficient to promote exocytosis of lysosomes. To investigate whether stability of microfilaments affected lysosomal exocytosis and its potentiation by cAMP, NRK cells stimulated or not with forskolin were exposed to the F-actin-stabilizing agent phalloidin. Because phalloidin is membrane-impermeable, it was added to the cells at the time of SLO permeabilization and kept during the exocytosis assay period. After exposure to phalloidin, the level of Ca2+-induced β-hexosaminidase release was reduced by 37% (Fig. 5 b). In forskolin-treated cells, a more pronounced inhibition of Ca2+-induced β-hexosaminidase release was observed (51%). These results indicate that stabilization of the actin cytoskeleton, in addition to reducing the levels of Ca2+-dependent lysosome exocytosis under normal conditions, prevents the potentiation induced by cAMP. Forskolin and cholera toxin are potent activators of adenylyl cyclase, which induce the accumulation of very high levels of cAMP in NRK cells (Figs. 2 and 4). We were thus interested in investigating the effect on lysosome exocytosis of cAMP elevation triggered by cell stimulation under more physiological conditions. For this we treated NRK cells with isoproterenol, an agonist that binds to β-adrenergic receptors in many cell types, activating adenylyl cyclase (32Spiegel A.M. Downs R.W. Endocr. Rev. 1981; 2: 275-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.6 a, cAMP levels in NRK cells after exposure to isoproterenol were elevated, although not to the same degree observed after forskolin treatment. Interestingly, a dose-dependent stimulatory effect of isoproterenol on lysosome exocytosis was detected when the culture supernatant of intact NRK cells was assayed for released β-hexosaminidase (Fig.6 b). The enhancement in exocytosis triggered by 2–4 μm isoproterenol was about 50%, a value comparable with what is induced by forskolin or 8-Br-cAMP on SLO-permeabilized cells in the presence of Ca2+ (Figs. 1 and 3). The overall exocytosis levels in the experiment shown in Fig. 6 a were, however, lower than what is observed in NRK cells after permeabilization and exposure to Ca2+-containing buffers. Taken together, these results suggest that stimulation of the β-adrenergic receptor in intact cells provides sufficient stimuli to trigger exocytosis of a small fraction of the lysosome population. Previous work showed that the intracellular protozoanT. cruzi invades mammalian cells by an unusual mechanism, which involves recruitment and fusion of host cell lysosomes at the parasite entry site (11Tardieux I.

Andrews N.W. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 349-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). T. cruzi entry is significantly enhanced by previous disassembly of host cell actin filaments as well as by host cell treatment with membrane-permeant analogs of cAMP (11Tardieux I. Webster P. Ravesloot J. Boron W. Lunn J.A. Heuser J. Andrews N.W. Cell. 1992; 71: 1117-1130Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). In addition, cell invasion by T. cruzirequires parasite-induced [Ca2+]i transients (13Tardieux I. Nathanson M.H. Andrews N.W. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 179: 1017-1022Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar,14Rodrı́guez A. Riuolt M. Ora A. Andrews N.W. J.

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4975-4986Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Taken together with the observations reported here, these findings demonstrate that there are important parallels between theT. cruzi cell invasion mechanism and the process of Ca2+-dependent lysosome exocytosis. We were thus interested in verifying if modulation of cAMP levels in host cells under physiological conditions could also affect the T. cruzi invasion process. As shown in Fig.7 a, pretreatment of NRK cells with the adenylyl cyclase inhibitor MDL-12,330A reduced invasion levels, whereas exposure to isoproterenol had a stimulatory effect. Furthermore, a consistent elevation in cAMP levels was detected in NRK cells after exposure to the infective T. cruzitrypomastigote stages but not after exposure to the noninfective epimastigotes (Fig. 7 b). These findings indicate that cAMP generated in host cells in response to trypomastigotes may play a role in the process of lysosome recruitment and fusion with the plasma membrane that occurs during parasite invasion (11Tardieux I.

Andrews N.W. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 349-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Potentiation of both constitutive and regulated secretion by elevation in cytosolic cAMP levels has been reported previously in several cell types (15O'Sullivan A.J. Jamieson J.D Biochem. J. 1992; 287: 403-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 16Ammala C. Ashcroft F.M. Rorsman P. Nature. 1993; 363: 356-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar, 17Morgan A. Wilkinson M.

The cAMP-dependent mechanisms responsible for enhanced exocytosis are unknown but may include direct phosphorylation of secretory vesicle membrane components by the cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (35Fushimi K.

Our results show that Ca2+-dependent exocytosis of lysosomes in NRK fibroblasts can be modulated by agents that regulate cAMP levels and also provide evidence in support of a regulatory role of the actin cytoskeleton in this process. Because a link between [Ca2+]i, actin cytoskeleton rearrangements, and lysosome fusion was demonstrated previously for the cell invasion mechanism of the protozoan parasite T. cruzi (11Tardieux I. Webster P. Ravesloot J. Boron W. Lunn J.A. Heuser J. Andrews N.W. Cell. 1992; 71: 1117-1130Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar, 12Rodrı́guez A. Samoff E. Rioult M.G. Chung A.

Med. 1994; 179: 1017-1022Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 14Rodrı́guez A. Riuolt M. Ora A. Andrews N.W. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 1263-1273Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), we investigated if the signaling events known to be involved in this process included host cell cAMP responses. Previous work had shown that membrane-permeant analogs of cAMP enhance T. cruzi entry into NRK fibroblasts (11Tardieux I. Webster P. Ravesloot J. Boron W. Lunn J.A. Heuser J. Andrews N.W. Cell. 1992; 71: 1117-1130Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). Here we show that enhancement in T. cruzi invasion is also observed upon host cell stimulation with isoproterenol, an agonist that binds to β-adrenergic G protein-coupled receptors, activating adenylyl cyclase. The smaller levels of enhancement in T. cruzi entry observed after isoproterenol treatment (Fig. 6 a), when compared with previous findings using membrane-permeant analogs of cAMP (11Tardieux I. Webster P. Ravesloot J. Boron W. Lunn J.A. Heuser J. Andrews N.W. Cell. 1992; 71: 1117-1130Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar), probably reflect the more physiologically significant and possibly localized cAMP elevation generated by binding of this agonist to β-adrenergic receptors. NRK cell exposure to isoproterenol triggered a small but dose-dependent lysosome exocytosis response, as reflected by the amount of β-hexosaminidase released into the culture supernatant (Fig. 6 b). This response was similar in magnitude to the β-hexosaminidase exocytic response we previously observed after cell stimulation with bombesin, which is another agonist that activates intracellular signaling pathways by binding to G protein-coupled receptors (6Rodriguez A. Webster P. Ortego J. Andrews N.W. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 93-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). Because in these experiments with agonists the cells were not permeabilized and exposed to Ca2+-containing buffers, the low lysosome exocytosis levels observed were not surprising, reflecting a more physiologically significant situation that may involve a concerted action of locally generated Ca2+ and cAMP. Indeed, in neurons and myocytes, activation of the β-adrenergic receptor-adenylyl cyclase-cAMP cascade results in potentiation of Ca2+ channel activity (42Huang C.C. Wang S.J. Gean P.W. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 2276-2282Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 43Sperelakis N. Xiong Z. Haddad G. Masuda H. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1994; 140: 103-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Although similar studies have not been performed in NRK cells, our cAMP measurements clearly indicate that stimulation of the β-adrenergic receptor in these cells also results in adenylyl cyclase activation. Elevated cAMP was observed in NRK cells after exposure to trypomastigotes, the infective stages of T. cruzi, but not after exposure to the noninfective epimastigote forms. This is a significant finding, because trypomastigotes are the T. cruzi life cycle stages that are capable of invading host cells through a Ca2+-dependent lysosome recruitment process, which involves parasite-mediated signaling (11Tardieux I. Webster P. Ravesloot J. Boron W. Lunn J.A. Heuser J. Andrews N.W. Cell. 1992; 71: 1117-1130Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar, 33Caler E.V. Vaena de Avalos S. Haynes P.A. Andrews N.W. Burleigh B. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4975-4986Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Epimastigotes, on the other hand, are the insect vector stages that are not capable of cell invasion or of triggering Ca2+signaling in mammalian cells (13Tardieux I. Nathanson M.H. Andrews N.W. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 179: 1017-1022Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). It is thus conceivable that the signaling events triggered by T. cruzi trypomastigotes in mammalian cells involve adenylyl cyclase activation and that this is an important component of the parasite invasion mechanism. This conclusion is reinforced by our finding that inhibition of NRK cell adenylyl cyclase activity by MDL-12,330A has a strong inhibitory effect onT. cruzi invasion (Fig. 7 a). Taken together with the finding that isoproterenol can trigger exocytosis of lysosomes, our results provide evidence indicating that physiological cell stimulation in conjunction with cAMP production facilitates mobilization of lysosomes for fusion with the plasma membrane. Receptor-mediated activation of the heterotrimeric GTPases Gs and Gi or the expression of their active subunits stimulate or inhibit adenylyl cyclase activity, respectively (44Neer E.J.

Ligation of the β-adrenergic receptor by isoproterenol, which we showed to stimulate both lysosome exocytosis and T. cruziinvasion, activates adenylyl cyclase through Gs (32Spiegel A.M. Downs R.W. Endocr. Rev. 1981; 2: 275-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Several lines of evidence point to the involvement of Gsand Gi in the regulation of the exocytic pathway. In epithelial cells, apical transport requires a Gs class of heterotrimeric G protein (26Pimplikar S.W. Simons K. Nature. 1993; 362: 456-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) acting through cAMP elevation and activation of protein kinase A (18Hansen S.T. Casanova J.E. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 677-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 19Pimplikar S.W. Simons K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19054-19059Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Regulated exocytosis in chromaffin cells appears to be controlled by at least two trimeric G proteins acting in series, with a secretory granule-associated Go protein controlling an ATP-dependent priming reaction and a plasma membrane-bound Gi3 involved in a late Ca2+-dependent fusion step (27Vitale N. Gensse M. Chasserot-Golaz S. Aunis D. Bader M.F. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1996; 8: 1274-1285Crossref Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Gi, and to a lesser extent Go, were implicated in the regulated exocytosis of insulin (45Lang J. Nishimoto I. Okamoto T. Regazzi R. Kiraly C. Weller U. Wollheim C.B. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3535-3644Crossref Scopus (125) Google Scholar). As predicted, we observed an enhancement in Ca2+-dependent exocytosis of lysosomes in NRK cells after treatment with cholera toxin, which activates Gs. Conversely, mastoparan, which activates Gi or Go, has an inhibitory effect. As discussed above, our results with the Gs activator isoproterenol directly demonstrate that stimulation of a receptor-mediated signaling pathway coupled to adenylyl cyclase can modulate both lysosome exocytosis and host cell invasion by the protozoan parasite T. cruzi. It is well documented that cAMP induces microtubule-dependent anterograde vesicle transport in a variety of cell types (46Forscher P. Kaczmarec L.K. Buchannan J. Smith S.J. J. Neurosci. 1987; 7: 3600-3611Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 47Kotz K.J. McNiven M.A. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 463-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Lysosomes in particular redistribute from the perinuclear area to the cell periphery in response to forskolin or to membrane-permeant analogs of cAMP (11Tardieux I. Webster P. Ravesloot J. Boron W. Lunn J.A. Heuser J. Andrews N.W. Cell. 1992; 71: 1117-1130Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar, 24Heuser J. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 855-864Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). The cAMP-induced redistribution of lysosomes was attributed to cytosolic acidification, also known to promote microtubule-dependent anterograde movement of lysosomes (24Heuser J. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 855-864Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar, 48Verhey K.J. Lizotte D.L. Abramson T. Barenboim L. Schnapp B.J. Rapoport T.A. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1053-1066Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Elevation in cAMP has been linked to intracellular acidification in some cell types, such as rat inner medullary-collecting duct cells, where increased cAMP levels activate HCO3− exit pathways (49Zhang C. Husted R.F. Stokes J.B. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: F131-F140Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is thus conceivable that acidification-dependent redistribution of lysosomes to the cell periphery plays a central role in the potentiation of both Ca2+-dependent exocytosis and cell invasion by T. cruzi, observed after elevation in cytosolic levels of cAMP. The cortical actin cytoskeleton has long been proposed to act as a physical barrier to exocytosis (20Koffer A. Tatham P.E.R. Gomperts B.D. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 919-927Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 21Trifar- J.M. Rodriguez del Castilho A. Vitale M.L. Mol. Neurobiol. 1992; 6: 339-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 22Morgan A. Essays Biochem. 1995; 30: 77-95PubMed Google Scholar). From studies on adrenal chromaffin cells, it was concluded that reorganization of the cortical actin network is necessary to allow granules to reach exocytic sites in stimulated cells (50Sontag J.M. Aunis D. Bader M.F. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 46: 316-326PubMed Google Scholar, 51Vitale M.L. Seward E.P. Trifaró J.M. Neuron. 1995; 14: 353-363Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). Actin filament disassembly is sufficient for triggering exocytosis in pancreatic acinar cells (40Epple H.J. Kreusel K.M. Hanski C. Schulzke J.D. Rieken E.O. Fromm M. Eur. J. Physiol. 1997; 433: 638-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), although in other cell types drugs that depolymerize actin do not elicit exocytosis but can potentiate agonist-evoked responses (52Lelkes P.I. Friedman J.E. Rosenheck V. Oplatka A. FEBS Lett. 1986; 208: 357-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 53Matter K. Dreyer F. Astories K. J. Neurochem. 1989; 52: 370-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Our observations on exocytosis of lysosomes in NRK cells are consistent with these findings; cytochalasin D or latranculin A do not trigger exocytosis in the absence of Ca2+ but significantly potentiate the Ca2+-evoked response. Furthermore, the enhancing effect of microfilament-disrupting drugs is additive to the effect of forskolin. When actin filaments are stabilized by exposure to phalloidin, the opposite is observed. Ca2+-dependent exocytosis of lysosomes is inhibited in both control and forskolin-treated cells. The simplest interpretation of these results is that disassembly of the cortical actin barrier facilitates access of lysosomes to the plasma membrane for subsequent fusion. The observation that Ca2+-induced lysosome exocytosis is impaired when depolymerization of microfilaments is blocked by phalloidin is consistent with this view, and because phalloidin reduces lysosome exocytosis in forskolin-treated cells to a greater extent than in control cells, it is conceivable that actin filaments act as an obstacle to cAMP-induced anterograde movement of lysosomes on microtubules. The results discussed above are fully consistent with previous findings demonstrating that disruption of the actin cytoskeleton of mammalian cells significantly facilitates invasion by T. cruzi (11Tardieux I. Webster P. Ravesloot J. Boron W. Lunn J.A. Heuser J. Andrews N.W. Cell. 1992; 71: 1117-1130Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). Host cell [Ca2+]i transients induced by T. cruzi trypomastigotes trigger transient rearrangements in the cortical actin cytoskeleton (14Rodrı́guez A. Riuolt M. Ora A. Andrews N.W. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 1263-1273Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), and this event is required for invasion (33Caler E.V. Vaena de Avalos S. Haynes P.A. Andrews N.W. Burleigh B. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4975-4986Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Because cell entry by T. cruzi involves recruitment and fusion of host cell lysosomes, it is significant that the cortical actin cytoskeleton also acts as a barrier for Ca2+-dependent lysosome exocytosis. Taken together with the effects of modulation in cAMP levels described in this work, our observations make it increasingly clear that there are important parallels between the mammalian signaling pathways that trigger lysosome exocytosis and the mechanism of cell invasion utilized byT. cruzi. We are grateful to A. Ma and H. Tan for excellent technical assistance and to B. Burleigh for critical reading of the manuscript."

Chem. 272, 10594–10600) allow us to present for the first time the complete structure of a major molecular species of a chlamydial LPS. Chlamydia are obligatory intracellular bacteria (1Moulder J.W. Microbiol. Rev. 1991; 55: 143-190Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) causing acute and chronic infections in animals and humans (2Schachter J. Caldwell H.D. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1980; 34: 285-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 3Storz J. Chlamydia and Chlamydia-induced Diseases. Charles C Thomas, Springfield, IL1971Google Scholar).Chlamydia trachomatis is the world′s leading cause of preventable blindness in developing countries in North Africa and Asia. It is also a predominant pathogen in sexually transmitted urogenital infections in developed countries and is considered as the major cause of secondary infertility in women resulting from tubal damage and occlusion. Reactive arthritis is another syndrome resulting from primary genital C. trachomatis infection. Chlamydia pneumoniae is a pathogen of the respiratory tract with which more than half of the adult population is infected in different geographic areas all over the world (4Kuo C.C. Jackson L.A. Campbell L.A. Grayston J.T. Microbiol. Rev. 1995; 8: 451-461Crossref Google Scholar). It is well established that the infection is usually mild in immunocompetent hosts, but severe pneumonias are observed in immunocompromised patients. There is an ongoing discussion on the putative association ofC. pneumoniae infections with atheroscleriosis in general and myocardial infarction in particular (5Saikku P. Mattila K. Nieminen M.S. Mäkelä P.H. Huttunen J.K. Valtonen V. Lancet. 1988; 2: 983-986Abstract PubMed Scopus (1423) Google Scholar). If this hypothesis would be verified it is necessary to identify the mechanisms by which chlamydiae can provide a continuous stimulus of inflammation, which at the same time would help to understand the chronic inflammatory processes in trachoma and pelvic inflammatory disease. Chlamydiae possess a lipopolysaccharide (LPS) 1The abbreviations used are: LPS, lipopolysaccharide; Kdo, 3-deoxy-d-manno-oct-2-ulopyranosonic acid; MALDI-MS, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry of low endotoxic activity (6Ingalls R.R. Rice P.A. Qureshi N. Takayama K. Lin J.S. Golenbock D.T. Infect. Immun. 1995; 63: 3125-3130Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Brade L. Schramek S. Schade U. Brade H. Infect. Immun. 1986; 54: 568-574Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which is attributed to the higher hydrophobicity of its lipid A moiety with fatty acids of longer chain length and the presence of nonhydroxylated fatty acids ester-linked to the sugar backbone. Chlamydial LPS harbors also a genus-specific epitope composed of a 3-deoxy-d-manno-oct-2-ulopyranosonic acid (Kdo) trisaccharide with the sequence Kdoα2→8Kdoα2→4Kdoα2→,which is surface-exposed and highly immunogenic (8Brade H. Brade H. Morrison D.C. Opal S. Vogel S. Endotoxin in Health and Disease. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1999Google Scholar). It is used in clinical microbiology laboratories as a marker for the whole genus and can be detected with monoclonal antibodies against it. This genus-specific Kdo trisaccharide is biosynthetically assembled by a single Kdo transferase and can be synthesized by recombinant Escherichia coli bacteria expressing chlamydial Kdo transferase genes (9Nano F.E. Caldwell H.D. Science. 1985; 228: 742-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The availability of LPS of such recombinant bacteria actually allowed us to determine the chemical and antigenic structure of the Kdo region (10Brade H. Brade L. Nano F.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 2508-2512Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), because chlamydial LPS was, due to its obligate intracellular growth, so far only available in quantities not allowing a structural analysis with the methods used at that time. With the improvements in analytical chemistry, particularly in NMR spectroscopy and mass spectrometry, the required amounts of LPS were reduced to levels that can now be prepared even from tissue culture-grown chlamydiae. Recently, Qureshi et al. (11Qureshi N. Kaltashov I. Walker K. Doroshenko V. Cotter R.J. Takayama K. Sievert T.R. Rice P.A. Lin J.-S.L. Golenbock D.T. J. Biol.

Here, we report the structure of the phosphorylated carbohydrate backbone of chlamydial LPS as determined by NMR spectroscopy, which, together with compositional analysis, mass spectrometric data on the de-O-acylated LPS, and the data of Qureshi et al. (11Qureshi N. Kaltashov I. Walker K. Doroshenko V. Cotter R.J. Takayama K. Sievert T.R. Rice P.A. Lin J.-S.L. Golenbock D.T. J. Biol.

The following experiments were performed as described: the determination of the absolute configuration of GlcN (12Holst O. Broer W. Thomas-Oates J.E. Mamat U. Brade H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 214: 703-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), analytical procedures for the quantification of Kdo, GlcN, and phosphate (12Holst O. Broer W. Thomas-Oates J.E. Mamat U. Brade H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 214: 703-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), and high-performance anion-exchange chromatography (13Holst O. Bock K. Brade L. Brade H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 229: 194-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), with the modification that in semi-preparative high-performance anion-exchange chromatography, the column was eluted with a linear gradient of 30–70% 1 m sodium acetate in 0.1m NaOH for 16 min, and then eluted isocratically with 70% 1 m sodium acetate in 0.1 m NaOH, and that fractions were desalted by gel-permeation chromatography (P5-Econo-Pac cartridges, Bio-Rad, Munich, Germany). The fatty acid analyses were performed according to Wollenweber and Rietschel (14Wollenweber H.-W. Rietschel E.T. J. Microbiol. Methods. 1990; 11: 195-224Crossref Scopus (149) Google Scholar). C. trachomatis serotype L2 was grown in monolayer cultures of mycoplasma-free L929 cells in multilayer trays (NUNC, 10 × 600-cm2) for 2 days. The cultures were killed by the addition of 0.5% (w/v) phenol, and the chlamydial elementary bodies were sedimented with the cell debris by centrifugation (Beckman J2–21 centrifuge, JA10 rotor, 9,000 ×g) yielding 2.88 g from 50,000 cm2 of infected cells. LPS was obtained by using the phenol/water method (15Westphal O. Jann K. Methods Carbohydr. Chem. 1965; 5: 83-91Google Scholar), modified as follows. The sediment was suspended in 75 ml of 45% phenol, containing 2% N-lauroylsarcosine sodium salt in water (w/v), heated at 68 °C for 10 min, and cooled on ice. After centrifugation (3,000 × g, 30 min), the water phase was removed and the phenol phase was extracted again with 35 ml of 2% aqueous N-lauroylsarcosine sodium. After centrifugation and separation as before, the extraction was repeated again. The water layers were combined, dialyzed against water, and lyophilyzed (yield 261 mg), then extracted twice with 90% aqueous phenol/chloroform/light petroleum (boiling point 40–60 °C) 2:5:8 (v/v/v). The organic solvents were evaporated, and the LPS was precipitated from the phenol phase by dropwise addition of water. The precipitated LPS was washed with acetone (yield 25.6 mg) dissolved in water (5 mg/ml) and precipitated with 10 volumes of ethanol/acetone 9:1 (v/v), dried, dissolved in water (5 mg/ml), and freeze-dried (yield 22.3 mg). Deacylation of LPS (2 mg) was according to the method of Holst et al. (16Holst O. Thomas-Oates J.E. Brade H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 222: 183-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) with the modifications that reactions were performed in the same reaction tube and that, after extraction of the fatty acids, the water phase was dialyzed using a dialyzer system (volume, 1 or 1.5 ml, Sialomed, CA) with cellulose acetate membranes (molecular weight cut off, 500). MALDI-MS of LPS and de-O-acylated LPS was performed with a Bruker-ReflexII (Bruker-Franzen Analytik, Bremen, Germany) in the linear time-of-flight configuration, with continuous ion extraction in the negative ion mode at an acceleration voltage of 30 kV. Samples (<10 nmol) were dispersed in 15 μl of aqueous triethylamine solution (0.18 m) and treated with small amounts of Amberlite IR-120 (H+) cation-exchanger (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) to remove excess sodium and potassium ions. The solutions were mixed with an equal volume of matrix solution (0.5m 2,4,6-trihydroxyacetophenone in methanol; Aldrich, Steinheim, Germany) and aliquots of 0.5 μl were deposited on a metallic sample holder and analyzed immediately after drying in a stream of air. The mass spectra shown are the sum of at least 50 laser shots. One-dimensional 1H-NMR and two-dimensional 1H,1H and1H,13C NMR (pD 5.0) spectra were recorded with a Bruker AMX-600 spectrometer, using a microprobe head (Bruker PHTXI 600SB H-C/N-D-02.5) and Bruker standard software. The 1H resonances were measured relative to internal acetone (2.225 ppm), and coupling constants were determined on the first-order basis (±0.5 Hz). The assignment of the proton chemical shifts was achieved by correlation spectroscopy, total correlation spectroscopy, and double-quantum-filtered correlation spectroscopy experiments. The assignment of carbon chemical shifts was achieved by1H,13C heteronuclear multiple quantum coherence experiments and by comparison to published 13C NMR data (13Holst O. Bock K. Brade L. Brade H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 229: 194-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 17Prytulla S. Lauterwein J. Klessinger M. Thiem J. Carbohydr. Res. 1991; 215: 345-349Crossref Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 18Bock K. Thomsen J.U. Kosma P. Christian R. Holst O. Brade H. Carbohydr. Res. 1992; 229: 213-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Nuclear Overhauser effect contacts were identified using rotating frame nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy and nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy experiments. 13C resonances were determined relative to internal dioxane (67.4 ppm). Preliminary experiments had shown that the extraction of chlamydial elementary bodies together with the cell debris gave higher yields of LPS than applying the phenol/chloroform/light petroleum method to purified elementary bodies. However, the LPS was equally distributed between the water and phenol phase. When 2% of N-lauroyl sarcosyl sodium were added to the phenol/water mixture, the large majority (>90%) of the LPS was found in the water phase (data not shown). Because phenol/water-extracted LPS contains a considerable amount of protein and nucleic acid, the extracted material was further purified by the phenol/chloroform/light petroleum method and by precipitation with ethanol/acetone from an aqueous solution. Sugar and phosphate analyses of the LPS identified Kdo, GlcN, and phosphate in the molar ratio of approximately 2.8:2.0:2.1, respectively. Fatty acid analysis revealed the presence of tetradecanoic, iso- and anteiso-branched pentadecanoic, hexadecanoic, octadecanoic, and eicosanoic acids as major fatty acids. Hexadecanoic, heptadecanoic, nonadecanoic, and heneicosanoic acids (all present as iso- and anteiso-branched fatty acids) are minor ester-linked fatty acids. It should be noted that no ester-linked 3-hydroxy fatty acids were identified. (R)-3-Hydroxyeicosanoic acid (158 nmol/mg LPS) was found to be the major amide-linked fatty acid, and (R)-3-hydroxyoctadecanoic (47 nmol/mg), (R)-3-hydroxynonadecanoic (traces), iso- and anteiso-branched (R)-3-hydroxyeicosanoic (traces), iso- (43 nmol/mg) and anteiso- (71 nmol/mg) branched (R)-3-hydroxyheneicosanoic, and (R)-3-hydroxydodecosanoic (16 nmol/mg) acids are present as minor amide-linked fatty acids. Molecular mass analysis of the purified LPS by MALDI-MS revealed the presence of molecular species consisting of lipid A (two GlcN and two phosphate residues, and 4–5 fatty acid residues) alone or substituted by 1, 2, or 3 Kdo residues (data not shown). No higher masses were detected. Because the mass resolution was low due to a considerable heterogeneity in fatty acid substitution and cation attachment, de-O-acylated LPS was prepared and analyzed using MALDI-MS (Fig. 1). The mass spectrum exhibited one major ion at m/z1781.1 corresponding to an [M-H]− ion consisting of 3 Kdo, 2 GlcN, 2 phosphate, and 2 amide-bound (R)-3-hydroxyeicosanoic acid residues. Less intense signals with mass differences of ±14 (CH2) were additionally identified, indicating also a heterogeneity of amide-bound fatty acids. This was confirmed by analysis of amide-bound fatty acids after HCl hydrolysis of de-O-acylated LPS. Minor ions were observed that represent molecular species representing de-O-acylated lipid A alone or substituted by 1 or 2 Kdo residues. However, it could not be decided to which extent these ions reflect intrinsic biological heterogeneity or are fragment ions produced in the ion source during laser desorption. In addition, an ion of low intensity atm/z 1701.1 corresponding to monophosphorylated de-O-acylated LPS was found. To analyze the carbohydrate backbone of the LPS from C. trachomatis L2, we applied the deacylation procedure of LPS published in Ref. 18Bock K. Thomsen J.U. Kosma P. Christian R. Holst O. Brade H. Carbohydr. Res. 1992; 229: 213-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar that comprises successive hydrazinolysis and hot KOH treatment. Fig. 2 shows the high-performance anion-exchange chromatography analyses of aliquots of the obtained products from LPS of C. trachomatis L2 (Fig. 2 A) and recombinant E. coli F515–207 (Fig.2 B) (12Holst O. Broer W. Thomas-Oates J.E. Mamat U. Brade H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 214: 703-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The major peak (peak II) in Fig.2 A possesses a retention time identical to that of Kdoα2→8Kdo- α2→4Kdoα2→6d-GlcpNβ1→6d-GlcpNα 1,4′-bisphosphate (pentasaccharide bisphosphate), which has been isolated previously from LPS of E. coli F515–207 (12Holst O. Broer W. Thomas-Oates J.E. Mamat U. Brade H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 214: 703-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). In addition, a small peak (Fig. 2 A, peak I) was detected in the chromatogram with a retention time identical to that of Kdoα2→4Kdoα2→6d-GlcpNβ1→6d-GlcpNα 1,4′-bisphosphate (tetrasaccharide bisphosphate) of LPS from E. coli F515–207 (12Holst O. Broer W. Thomas-Oates J.E. Mamat U. Brade H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 214: 703-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). From deacylated LPS, oligosaccharide II (Fig.2 A, 110 μg, 5.5% LPS) was isolated using high-performance anion-exchange chromatography and investigated by NMR spectroscopy. The1H and 13C chemical shift assignments (TableI) are based on two-dimensional correlation spectroscopy, nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy, rotating frame nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy, total correlation spectroscopy (Fig. 3), and a heteronuclear multiple quantum coherence experiment. Chemical shifts were similar to those of pentasaccharide bisphosphate (13Holst O. Bock K. Brade L. Brade H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 229: 194-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Larger differences were observed in the chemical shifts of H-1 and C-1 of residue A (see Fig. 4 for labeling of residues), caused by a different pD of the sample in Ref. 13Holst O. Bock K. Brade L. Brade H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 229: 194-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar. In the1H NMR spectrum, two signals were found in the anomeric region (at 5.64 and 4.65 ppm) that could be assigned to one α-linked [3 J H-1,H-2 4.0 Hz] and one β-linked [3 J H-1,H-2 7.0 Hz] GlcN residue (A and B), respectively. The H, P-coupling constant [3 J H-1,P 7.0 Hz] indicated the substitution of O-1 of the reducing GlcN by a phosphate residue. The α-pyranosidic configuration of Kdo residues C, D, and E was deduced from the proton signals of H-3ax and H-3eq, which were in the region 1.7–2.2 ppm, characteristic for deoxyprotons (16Holst O.

Also, the chemical shifts of H-6a,b of GlcN residues A and B were shifted downfield, indicating the substitution of both sugars at O-6. In the13C NMR spectrum, the signal of C-4 of Kdo C was shifted downfield (about 4 ppm), whereas a slight β-shift of about 1 ppm was found for C-5 indicating the substitution of residue C at position O-4. The second phosphate residue was linked to O-4 of residue B, as shown by the downfield chemical shift of C-4 (73.4 ppm). The downfield shifts of the C-6 signals of residues A and B confirmed their substitution at O-6; that of residue A was also proven by a nuclear Overhauser effect contact between H-1 of residue B and H-6 of residue A. The observed contacts between protons H-3eq of residue C and H-6 of residue D proved the sequence Kdoα2→4Kdoα2→ (C-D) (13Holst O. Bock K. Brade L. Brade H. Eur. J.

For residues A–E see Fig. 4. Taken together, our data establish (i) the structure of oligosaccharide II as Kdoα2→8Kdoα2→4Kdoα2→6d-GlcpNβ1→6d-GlcpNα 1,4′-bisphosphate, which is identical to pentasaccharide bisphosphate isolated from LPS of recombinant E. coli F515–207 (12Holst O. Broer W. Thomas-Oates J.E. Mamat U. Brade H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 214: 703-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) and (ii) the structure of de-O-acylated LPS as shown in Fig. 4. The increasing biomedical interest in Chlamydia has inititated investigations more than a decade ago on the molecular organization of this obligatory intracellular bacterium. Because of its intracellular growth, these studies were hampered by the availability of only minute quantities of the microorganism and isolated compounds. When it was found that chlamydial genes can be expressed in E. coli (20Wenman W.M. Lorett M.A. Nature. 1982; 269: 68-70Crossref Scopus (15) Google Scholar), the knowledge on a number of immunogenic proteins grew rapidly. A complex glycolipid antigen was also recognized at that time as a major surface antigen with genus specificity but nothing was known on its chemical or antigenic structure. In the 1980s, independent reports were published on the relatedness of this antigen to enterobacterial rough LPS of the Re-chemotype (containing Kdo as the only core sugar), which was based on compositional analysis, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis profiles and serology (7Brade L. Schramek S. Schade U. Brade H. Infect. Immun. 1986; 54: 568-574Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Nurminen M. Leinonen M. Saikku P. Mäkelä P.H. Science. 1983; 220: 1279-1281Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 23Nurminen M. Rietschel E.T. Brade H. Infect. Immun. 1985; 48: 573-575Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Finally, the preparation of monoclonal antibodies against the genus-specific epitope allowed the identification of a cloned chlamydial gene as a Kdo transferase, which was able to synthesize the chlamydial epitope in an E. coli background (9Nano F.E. Caldwell H.D. Science. 1985; 228: 742-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). These recombinant bacteria gave us access to a structural analysis of the genus-specific epitope that turned out to be a Kdo trisaccharide of the sequence Kdoα2→8Kdoα2→4Kdoα2→ (10Brade H. Brade L. Nano F.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 2508-2512Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The assumption that the same structure occurs also in chlamydial LPS was based only on the reactivity of monoclonal antibodies and on a mass spectrometric “finger-print” of a chlamydial LPS fragment (10Brade H. Brade L. Nano F.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 2508-2512Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). There was never the slightest doubt from our or other groups on the correctness of this assumption, but when we and others became interested in the chlamydial LPS as an endotoxin and in its biosynthesis, it was necessary to investigate again chlamydial LPS to determine the following: (i) the structure of the lipid A moiety (which in the LPS of the recombinant bacteria was of theE. coli type); (ii) the linkage point of the Kdo to the lipid A region; and (iii) whether components other than the Kdo trisaccharide were present in the core region. The latter point was of particular interest because meanwhile it became known that the Kdo transferase of Chlamydia psittaci was able to assemble a branched Kdo tetrasaccharide in the E. colibackground (13Holst O. Bock K. Brade L. Brade H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 229: 194-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Because the endotoxic activity of LPS depends mainly on the structure of the lipid A moiety (22Rietschel E.T. Kirikae T. Schade F.U. Mamat U. Schmidt G. Loppnow H. Ulmer A.J. Zähringer U. Seydel U. DiPadova F. Schreier M. Brade H. FASEB J. 1994; 8: 217-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (1326) Google Scholar), we first discuss this part of the molecule. It is known from earlier reports that chlamydial lipid A is of less endotoxic potency than enterobacterial lipid A, which was attributed to the lower number of acyl chains and to their longer chain length (6Ingalls R.R. Rice P.A. Qureshi N. Takayama K. Lin J.S. Golenbock D.T. Infect. Immun. 1995; 63: 3125-3130Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,7Brade L. Schramek S. Schade U. Brade H. Infect. Immun. 1986; 54: 568-574Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Compositional analyses had indicated that there were on the average two hydroxy and 3.2 nonhydroxy fatty acids in amide- and ester-linkage, respectively, and two phosphate groups/2 mol of glucosamine suggesting, in analogy to many lipid A structures, the presence of a bisphosphorylated glucosamine backbone but the lack of ester-linked hydroxy fatty acids (7Brade L. Schramek S. Schade U. Brade H. Infect. Immun. 1986; 54: 568-574Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Nurminen M. Rietschel E.T. Brade H. Infect. Immun. 1985; 48: 573-575Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, Qureshi et al. (11Qureshi N. Kaltashov I. Walker K. Doroshenko V. Cotter R.J. Takayama K. Sievert T.R. Rice P.A. Lin J.-S.L. Golenbock D.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10594-10600Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) showed in a detailed mass spectrometric analysis of a major molecular monophosphoryl lipid A species that indeed only two hydroxy fatty acids are present in chlamydial lipid A and that these are exclusively amide-linked. After the analysis of hundreds of lipid A structures, this is the first example that positions 3 and 3′ of the lipid A backbone are not substituted with 3-hydroxy fatty acids. These authors also determined the number and distribution of fatty acids showing that a tetra- and pentaacyl species predominate, the latter containing a single acyloxyacyl residue in amide-linkage on the distal sugar unit. This work also confirmed the enormous heterogeneity of the acyl chains described earlier (7Brade L. Schramek S. Schade U. Brade H. Infect. Immun. 1986; 54: 568-574Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Nurminen M. Rietschel E.T. Brade H. Infect. Immun. 1985; 48: 573-575Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The structural analysis of the lipid A backbone and its substitution with phosphate was not determined. Therefore, we isolated the complete carbohydrate backbone after successive deacylation with hydrazine and potassium hydroxide and investigated the purified product by NMR spectroscopy. The data clearly identified the lipid A backbone as GlcpNβ1→6GlcpNα 1,4′P 2. Because glycosidic linkages are not cleaved under the conditions used for deacylation, the sugar composition of the core region could be analyzed on the same compound. The Kdo trisaccharide of the sequence Kdoα2→8Kdoα2→4Kdoα2→ was identified by various one- and two-dimensional NMR experiments in comparison to reference compounds (12Holst O. Broer W. Thomas-Oates J.E. Mamat U. Brade H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 214: 703-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), and the linkage of this trisaccharide to the lipid A moiety was determined as 2→6. MALDI-MS analysis of de-O-acylated chlamydial LPS identified as a major fraction a molecular species composed of Kdo, GlcN, phosphate, and 3-hydroxyeicosanoic acid in a ratio of 3:2:2:2, respectively. This indicates that the major portion of chlamydial LPS does not contain components other than those described here, unless these would be present in hydrazine-labile linkage. In summary, our data are in agreement with those published by us and others and add important structural details not known before. Taken together, the structure of LPS of C. trachomatis serotype L2 is as shown in Fig. 5. It is noted that the data on fatty acid composition and distribution determined here for serotype L2 are similar to those described by Qureshi et al.(11Qureshi N. Kaltashov I. Walker K. Doroshenko V. Cotter R.J. Takayama K. Sievert T.R. Rice P.A. Lin J.-S.L. Golenbock D.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10594-10600Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) for serotype F. Based on this knowledge, we have recently started to synthesize the chlamydial lipid A to study its endotoxic activity and its function as an acceptor for chlamydial Kdo transferases, studies which so far could not be done on homogenous compounds.

The rules that govern the selectivity of this process are not well understood. Here, we expressed combinations of subunits from two related GluR subfamilies in COS7 cells, the α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid (AMPA) and kainate receptors. By co-immunoprecipitation experiments, we assessed the ability of AMPA receptor subunits to assemble into multimeric complexes. Subunits GluR1–4 associated with indistinguishable efficiency with each other, whereas the kainate receptor subunits GluR6 and 7 showed a much lower degree of association with GluR1. Using chimeric receptors and truncation fragments of subunits, we show that this assembly specificity is determined by N-terminal regions of these subunits and that the most N-terminal domain of GluR2 together with a membrane anchor efficiently associates with GluR1.

Fast excitatory synaptic transmission in the mammalian central nervous system is primarily mediated by multimeric ligand-gated ion channels, which are activated by the neurotransmitter glutamate. Based on pharmacological properties and sequence similarities, these receptors fall into three main classes: the glutamate receptor (GluR) 1The abbreviations used are: GluR, glutamate receptor; AMPA, α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid; TMD, transmembrane domain; MuSK, muscle-specific kinase; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; mAb, monoclonal antibody; pAb, polyclonal antibody; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; SB, solubilization buffer subunits 1–4 form the family of α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid (AMPA) receptors, subunits GluR5–7 and KA1 and KA2 are the family of kainate receptors, and subunits NR1 and NR2A–D are components ofN-methyl-d-aspartate receptors (1Hollmann M.

Functional receptors of each type are composed of multiple subunits. Recent experiments suggest that each receptor complex contains four subunits (3Laube B. Kuhse J. Betz H. J.

Recombinant expression of an individual type of subunit in nonneuronal cells in many cases leads to the formation of functional homomeric ion channels. Coexpression of two or more subunits of the same class, however, mainly directs the formation of heteromeric channels (10Verdoorn T.A. Burnashev N. Monyer H. Seeburg P.H. Sakmann B.

Their electrophysiological characteristics are different from those of their homomeric counterparts and often are quite similar to channels present in neurons. In vivo, GluRs are thought to be predominantly or perhaps exclusively composed of heteromeric channels, based on their functional similarity with recombinant channels as well as co-immunoprecipitation experiments (7Wenthold R.J.

For example, AMPA receptors lacking the GluR2 subunit are permeable for calcium, whereas channels containing at least one GluR2 subunit do not allow calcium entry into the cells (10Verdoorn T.A.

This diversity is further enhanced by alternative splicing of most subunits (21Nakanishi N. Axel R. Shneider N.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

One possibility is that association occurs randomly and the composition of the GluRs in each cell is simply determined by the availability of individual subunits. An alternative possibility is that subunits preferentially interact with one or a small group of other subunits and thereby favor the formation of GluRs with a distinct subunit composition. A classical example for such a stereotypic receptor assembly pathway is the muscle nicotinic acetylcholine receptor.N-terminal domains of individual subunits of this neurotransmitter receptor initiate association of specific subunits in an ordered process (23Kreienkamp H.-J.

All AMPA receptor subunits but not kainate receptor subunits associated with the GluR1 subunit with high efficiency. Using chimeric receptors and truncation fragments of subunits, we show that this subfamily specificity of assembly is determined by N-terminal regions of subunits. Biotinylated sheep anti-rabbit F(ab′)2 fragment was purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals; horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech; streptavidin-agarose was obtained from Sigma; and immobilized monomeric avidin (ImmunoPure) was from Pierce. Anti-myc (9E10) mAb was affinity-purified from hybridoma supernatants. Cy3-conjugated anti-mouse antibody was obtained from Jackson Immunoresearch. The cDNA clones GluR1 (flop), GluR2 (flip) GluR4 (flip), and GluR7 were kind gifts from R. Sprengel and P. Seeburg (Heidelberg); the clones of the AMPA receptor subunit GluR3 (flip) and the kainate receptor subunit GluR6 as well as the GluR1- and GluR6 derivatives (R1-PCS and R6-PCS) used for the construction of the GluR1-GluR6 chimeras were kind gifts from M. Hollmann (Göttingen). The hexa-myc-tag was amplified from the pCS2+MT vector (39Turner D. Weintraub H. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1434-1447Crossref PubMed Scopus (954) Google Scholar) by PCR (primers: TCC CAT CGA TCT GCA GCT ATG GAG and GAG AGG CCT TGC ATG CAA GTC CTC TTC) and subcloned into the HV vector (40Ferns M.J. Campanelli J.T. Hoch W. Scheller R.H. Hall Z. Neuron. 1993; 11: 491-502Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar) between thePstI and SphI sites. The polylinker of the pCMV2-expression vector (41Andersson S. Davis D.L. Dahlback H. Jörnvall H. Russell D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8222-8229Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was expanded by introducing a NotI site; the plasmid Sac-KiSS-λ (42Tsang T.C. Harris D.T. Akporiaye E.T. Schluter S.F. Bowden G.T. Hersh E.M. BioTechniques. 1996; 20: 51-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) was digested with XbaI, and the resulting λ fragment containing the NotI site was inserted into theXbaI site of pCMV2. By digestion with NotI and re-ligation, the λ insert was eliminated resulting in a pCMV2 with aNotI site between two XbaI sites (pCMV2-Not). The PCR-amplified hexa-myc-tag (primers: CAT CGA TTT AAA GCG GCC GCT ATG GAG CAA and TAG TTC TAG AGT CTA GAG AGG CCT TGA) was introduced between the NotI and the second XbaI site, the TAG ofXbaI forming the stop codon. Constructs that were to be tagged at their N terminus were first amplified by PCR (the 5′-primer contained an SphI site, the 3′-primer either an XbaI site or a NotI site), inserted into HV-N-myc between SphI and XbaI and then subcloned into pCMV2 using ClaI and XbaI except for GluR7N, where KpnI and XbaI was used. Constructs with a C-terminal myc-tag were PCR-amplified, inserted into the HV vector without myc-tag between SphI andNotI, and then subcloned into pCMV2-C-myc usingClaI and NotI. Since ClaI and XbaI cut in the coding region of the AMPA subunit GluR4, the polylinker of HV-N-myc was modified by introducing a MluI site between SalI andClaI. The PCR-amplified GluR4 sequence was inserted into the modified HV-N-myc vector with SphI and NotI and subcloned into the pCMV2-Not vector using MluI andNotI. MuSK-cDNA (43Hopf C. Hoch W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 253: 382-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) was subcloned into pCMV2-C-myc between theClaI and NotI site. All full-length constructs start at position 1 behind the signal sequence (13Keinänen K. Wisden W. Sommer B. Werner P. Herb A. Verdoorn T.A. Sakmann B. Seeburg P.H. Science. 1990; 249: 556-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (1199) Google Scholar). The position of the first and last amino acid of the deletion fragments are numbered according to Keinänen et al. (13Keinänen K. Wisden W. Sommer B. Werner P. Herb A. Verdoorn T.A. Sakmann B. Seeburg P.H. Science. 1990; 249: 556-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (1199) Google Scholar): C1 (1–365), C2 (1–524), C3 (1–546), C4 (1–618), C5 (1–812), N1 (378–862), C1-TMD A (1–381 and 525–544), C1-TMD C (1–381 and 792–862), C2-TMD C (1–524 and 792–862), TMD A-B (525–618), and TMD C (792–862). GluR1-PCS and GluR6-PCS (44Villmann C. Bull L. Hollmann M. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 7634-7643Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were digested with NruI and EcoRI, and the fragment containing the pore loop region of GluR6 was inserted at the corresponding position of GluR1-PCS. The pore loop cassette was then excised using BglII and introduced into the GluR1-expression vector (pCDM8, Ref. 13Keinänen K. Wisden W. Sommer B. Werner P. Herb A. Verdoorn T.A. Sakmann B. Seeburg P.H. Science. 1990; 249: 556-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (1199) Google Scholar). R1-PCS and R6-PCS were digested either by NotI andNruI (for R6-PL1-R1) or NotI and EcoRI (for R6-PL6-R1). The R6 fragment consisting of the N terminus with or without the pore loop was inserted into R1-PCS. Then these chimeras were digested with XhoI, the ends treated with the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I, and digested with NarI. TheNarI/(XhoI) fragment was inserted betweenNarI and SmaI of untagged GluR6 (in pCMV2), thus yielding the final chimeric constructs in the pCMV2 expression vector. R1-PCS and R6-PCS were digested either by NotI andNruI (for R1N-PL6-R6) or NotI andEcoRI (for R1N-PL1-R6). The R1 fragment consisting of the N terminus with or without the pore loop was inserted into R6-PCS. These chimeras were digested with XmaCI and inserted into the N-terminally myc-tagged GluR1 (in the pCMV2) that had been digested with the same enzyme. Fragments C1 and C2 as well as the C-terminal part containing the last putative transmembrane domain of GluR2 (TMD C) were amplified by PCR. The PCR products C1 and C2 were digested bySphI and NotI and inserted into HV-N-myc (see above). PCR product TMD C was inserted into pCMV2 by exchanging the myc-tag of pCMV2-C-myc for TMD C using NotI and XbaI. The N-terminally myc-tagged sequences for C1 and C2 were then subcloned from HV into pCMV2 (with TMD C) using ClaI andNotI yielding C1-TMD C and C2-TMD C. C1-TMD A was constructed using two sense and two antisense oligonucleotides representing the first putative transmembrane domain of GluR2 (TMD A) containing a NotI site at the 5′-end and anXbaI site at the 3′-end as well as sticky ends corresponding to the mid-region of TMD A. Equal amounts of each oligonucleotide were used for ligation into pCMV2-Not between NotI andXbaI. C1 was then subcloned from HV-N-myc into pCMV2 containing the first transmembrane domain using ClaI andNotI. The integrity of the constructs was verified by specific restriction analysis, expression in COS7 cells, and partial sequencing across regions connecting original sequences with the myc-tag or the transmembrane domains. A cDNA fragment corresponding to the C terminus of GluR1 (amino acids 811–889, Ref. 13Keinänen K. Wisden W. Sommer B. Werner P. Herb A. Verdoorn T.A. Sakmann B. Seeburg P.H. Science. 1990; 249: 556-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (1199) Google Scholar) was amplified by PCR (primers: CCT TAA TCG GAT CCT GCT ACA AAT and GGC ACT GCA GGG CTT GG) and inserted into the pQE30 vector (Qiagen) between BamHI and PstI. The fusion protein containing an N-terminal hexahistidine tag was overexpressed in Escherichia coli and purified as described (43Hopf C. Hoch W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 253: 382-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Rabbits were immunized with the fusion protein in Freund's adjuvant. After the fourth boost, the serum was purified over an affinity column with the fusion protein coupled to a mixture of Affi-Gel 10 and 15 (Bio-Rad). One day prior to transfection, COS7 cells were seeded at a density of 700,000 cells/10-cm culture dish in COS medium (10% (v/v) fetal calf serum in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium). COS7 cells were transfected transiently as described previously (45Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (4824) Google Scholar) with some minor variations that were found to improve transfection efficiency; the transfection mix contained 40 μg of DNA/10-cm culture dish, and the incubation time was reduced to 6 h, thereby increasing cell survival. Usually, cells were harvested on the third day after transfection in phosphate-buffered saline containing 5 mmEDTA, 5 mm EGTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mm benzamidine. COS7 cells were lysed with 500 μl of ice-cold solubilization buffer (SB: 1% (w/v) Triton X-100, 500 mm NaCl, 5 mm EGTA, 5 mm EDTA in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.1) containing freshly added protease inhibitors (1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mmbenzamidine, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin) for 2 h at 4 °C in a head-over-head shaker. Then, the lysate was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C and the protein concentration of the supernatant was determined using bicinchoninic acid (BCA, Pierce) with bovine serum albumin as standard. In the solubilization experiments shown in TableI, proteins from 200 μl of the detergent extract were precipitated and together with a corresponding aliquot of the insoluble fraction analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting.Table IDetergent solubility and surface localization of full-length subunits, chimeras, and deletion fragments of GluR2ConstructDetergent-solubleSurface localization%R2N41+R6N41+R1N-PL6-R651+R1N-PL1-R641+C123+C230+C337+C447−C557NDN144+C1-TMD A13−C1-TMD C21+C2-TMD C24+TMD A-B45−TMD C34+COS7 cells were transfected with cDNA coding for the full-length GluR subunits, deletion fragments, or the chimeric proteins R1N-PL6-R6 and R1N-PL1-R6.

Both fragments were also detected in the medium. 25 μl of streptavidin-agarose were incubated with 1 μg of biotinylated anti-rabbit F(ab′)2 fragment in SB for 1 h at 4 °C in a head-over-head shaker. After three washes with SB, the beads were incubated with anti-GluR1 pAb in SB (1 h, 4 °C). The beads were washed three times in SB before adding 500–600 μl of cleared lysate containing 0.5 mg/ml protein. After incubation overnight at 4 °C followed by three washes with SB, the beads were incubated with anti-myc mAb in SB for 1 h, followed by another three washes with SB. Finally, peroxidase-linked anti-mouse Ig was added in SB and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C. The beads were then washed three times with SB and once with peroxidase reaction buffer (100 mm sodium acetate, 50 mmNaH2PO4, pH 6). 300 μl of peroxidase reaction buffer containing 2 mm2,2′-azinobis(3-ethylbenzthiazolinesulfonic acid) and 0.016% H2O2 were added and incubated for approximately 10 min at room temperature. The beads were pelleted by centrifugation, and the absorbance of the supernatant measured at 405 nm. The amount of co-immunoprecipitated myc-tagged protein was normalized with respect to the amount of the same protein present in the cell lysate. The data were then corrected for the amount of either GluR1 or the chimeras R1-PL6-R1, R6-PL1-R1, or R6-PL6-R1 by using the calibration curve given in Fig. 2. For better comparison between single results, the association efficiency was expressed as percentage of the association obtained for the combination of GluR1 and myc-tagged GluR2 (“R1 + R2N”). 25 μl of monomeric avidin-beads were incubated with 2 mmd-biotin in solubilization buffer at 4 °C (three times, 20 min each) to block biotin-binding sites of residual oligomeric avidin. The biotin was then removed from monomeric avidin by washing the beads three times (5 min each) with elution buffer (100 mm glycine, pH 2.5, 1% (w/v) Triton X-100). The beads were incubated first with biotinylated anti-rabbit F(ab′)2fragment in SB, then with anti-GluR1 pAb (see above) before 400 μl of detergent extract (protein concentration 0.5 mg/ml) were added and incubated overnight. The beads were washed three times with SB, and then the precipitated proteins were eluted by incubating the beads twice with 100 μl of elution buffer for 15 min at room temperature. The two eluates were combined, and the amount of co-precipitated myc-tagged protein as well as its amount present in the solubilized fraction was determined by dot blotting (see below). Proteins were precipitated from detergent extracts (46Wessel D. Flügge U.I. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 138: 141-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (3191) Google Scholar) and separated by SDS-PAGE (47Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). After transfer to nitrocellulose (48Kyhse-Andersen J. J. Biochem. Biophys. Methods. 1984; 10: 203-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (2159) Google Scholar) using the buffer system described by Eckerskorn et al. (49Eckerskorn C. Mewes W. Goretzki H. Lottspeich F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 176: 509-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar), incubation with the primary antibodies as indicated in the figure legends and the corresponding secondary antibodies, immunoreactive bands were visualized by chemiluminescence using SuperSignal (Pierce) as a substrate. Dot-blot analysis was performed as described (50Becker C.M. Hoch W. Betz W. J. Neurochem. 1989; 53: 124-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) with slight modifications: 25–30 μl of cleared lysate (protein concentration: 1 mg/ml) were immobilized on a nitrocellulose membrane (diameter: 15 mm). The air-dried membrane was incubated with either the anti-myc mAb or the anti-GluR1 pAb and secondary antibodies conjugated to horseradish. After the last washing step, membrane dots were punched out and incubated with 250 μl of reaction buffer (100 mmNaH2PO4, pH 4.5, containing 0.4 mg/mlo-phenylene diamine and 0.01% H2O2) for 5–20 min. The reaction was stopped by adding 105 μl of 30% H2SO4 and the absorbance measured at 492 nm. COS7 cells were transfected with cDNAs coding for various myc-tagged proteins. On the third day after transfection, anti-myc mAb was added to the culture medium and incubated for 2 h at room temperature. After three washes with phosphate-buffered saline containing 1 mm Ca2+ and 0.5 mmMg2+ (PBS Ca/Mg), the cells were incubated for 30 min with blocking buffer (5% goat serum and 1.5% bovine serum albumin in PBS Ca/Mg). The cells were then exposed for 1 h to Cy3-conjugated secondary antibody in blocking buffer and washed extensively with PBS Ca/Mg. We wanted to monitor the assembly of AMPA and other receptor subunits into heteromeric receptors by co-expressing epitope-tagged and untagged subunits in COS7 cells and immunoprecipitating heteromeric receptors with a subunit-specific antibody. To this end, we cloned the following cDNAs into expression vectors appropriate for transient transfection in COS7 cells: the four AMPA receptor subunits (GluR1–4), two kainate receptor subunits (GluR6 and 7), and a nonrelated membrane protein of comparable size, the muscle-specific kinase (MuSK). These subunits were either expressed untagged or contained six repeats of a peptide derived from the Myc protein. This epitope tag was fused either to the C-terminal end of the proteins or to the N terminus behind a signal sequence and allowed us to detect all expressed receptor proteins with a single antibody. Thus, we avoided quantification problems originating from the use of multiple antibodies with different affinities. Transfection of all constructs into COS7 cells yielded proteins of the expected size, as seen on Western blots probed with the myc-tag-specific antibody (Fig. 1 A). For specific immunoprecipitation of homomeric and heteromeric GluRs, we generated an antiserum recognizing selectively the AMPA receptor subunit GluR1. The serum was directed against a fusion protein that consisted of an N-terminal hexahistidine tag followed by the C-terminal sequence of GluR1. This part of the subunit is localized intracellularly and represents the most divergent region between different GluR subunits. Antibodies affinity-purified from this serum recognized a band of the expected size in COS7 cells that had been transfected with expression constructs encoding both untagged and myc-tagged GluR1 subunits. No cross-reactivity with any of the three other AMPA receptor subunits: the kainate receptor subunits GluR6 and 7 or the control protein MuSK, was detected (Fig. 1 B). The serum was able to immunoprecipitate more than 90% of GluR1 subunit from detergent extracts of transfected COS7 cells, as determined by Western blotting and dot blotting (data not shown). In order to assess the influence of subunit concentration on heteromeric receptor assembly, we expressed a constant amount of epitope-tagged GluR2 subunit with variable amounts of untagged GluR1 subunit."

PC12W cells express abundant AT2 receptor but not angiotensin II type 1 receptor and undergo apoptosis when stimulated by angiotensin II. AT2receptor-induced ceramide accumulation preceded the onset of caspase 3 activation and DNA fragmentation. AT2 receptor-induced ceramide accumulation did not result from the degradation of complex sphingolipids (SL) such as sphingomyelin or glycosphingolipids, as no changes in neutral or acidic sphingomyelinase activities, sphingomyelin level, nor in cellular glycolipid composition were observed. AT2 receptor activated serine palmitoyltransferase with a maximum time of 24 h after angiotensin II stimulation. The AT2 receptor-induced accumulation of ceramide was blocked by inhibitors of the de novo pathway of SL synthesis, β-chloro-l-alanine and fumonisin B1. Inhibition of the de novo biosynthesis of SLs by fumonisin B1 and β-chloro-l-alanine completely abrogated the AT2 receptor-mediated apoptosis. Pertussis toxin and orthovanadate blocked AT2 receptor-mediated ceramide production.

The high levels and transient expression of AT2 receptors in many neonatal tissues and some pathological states such as vascular injury and myocardial infarction have led to the postulate that this receptor has a role in the cardiovascular development and remodeling. AT1 receptor stimulates proliferation, whereas AT2 receptor exerts growth inhibitory effects both in cultured cells as well as in vivo (3Stoll M. Steckelings U.M. Paul M. Bottari S.P. Metzger R. Unger T. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 651-657Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Yamada T. Horiuchi M. Dzau V.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

One of the growth inhibitory effects of AT2 receptor is apoptosis (4Yamada T. Horiuchi M. Dzau V.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 156-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (667) Google Scholar). Despite growing interest in AT2receptor-mediated apoptosis, relatively little is known about the molecular basis of this process. It has been shown that ERK inactivation by AT2 receptor results in Bcl-2 dephosphorylation, which may contribute to apoptosis (6Horiuchi M. Hayashida W. Kambe T. Yamada T. Dzau V.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19022-19026Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). The potential significance of AT2 receptor-induced apoptosis led us to explore further the signaling mechanism of this process in this study. Several lines of evidence suggest that sphingolipids are important mediators of apoptosis (7Hannun Y.A. Science. 1996; 274: 1855-1859Crossref PubMed Scopus (1500) Google Scholar). We therefore considered the possibility that SLs would play a role in the proapoptotic signaling of AT2 receptor. We found that an increase in ceramide levels was followed by protease activation and DNA fragmentation. AT2 receptor-induced ceramide accumulation did not result from the degradation of complex SLs such as sphingomyelin or glycosphingolipids. Based on the measurement of serine palmitoyltransferase activity and use of inhibitors, the activation ofde novo sphingolipid biosynthesis plays a key role in AT2 receptor-mediated apoptosis. Taken together, our current data suggest that AT2 receptor induces the activation of de novo pathway, which then leads to an accumulation of a sphingolipid metabolite, possibly ceramide, that results in apoptosis.

The anti-ERK antibody (recognizing rat and mouse ERK 1 and 2) was from Upstate. All other reagents were from Sigma or were of the highest available research quality. PC12W, a subline of PC12 rat pheochromocytoma cell line that expresses high levels of AT2 receptor but no AT1 receptor, were cultured as described previously (4Yamada T. Horiuchi M. Dzau V.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 156-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (667) Google Scholar, 8Speth R.C. Kim K.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 169: 997-1006Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Briefly, PC12W cells were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 5% horse serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 1 mg/ml streptomycin in humidified atmosphere of 95% O2 and 5% CO2, and cells were used in passages 10–20. AT2 receptor binding was analyzed every five passages and no changes in receptor expression was observed. In each experiment, cells were grown in DMEM until they reached 70–80% confluence. In our experiments, cells were grown in 10% fetal calf serum and 5% horse serum before switching to serum-free medium containing NGF (10 ng/ml) with or without AngII. Cardiomyocytes were prepared from the hearts of neonatal Sprague-Dawley rats (postnatal day 1) according to published methods (9Dostal D.E. Rothblum K.N. Conrad K.M. Cooper G.R. Baker K.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 263: C851-C863Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Ventricles were cut and then digested with collagenase II. The cells obtained from a 10-min digestion period were collected and preplated in DMEM supplemented with 20% calf serum at 37 °C for 90 min. Then the nonadhering cells, collected as a cardiomyocyte-rich population, were seeded (2 × 105/cm2) and maintained for the subsequent 2 days in DMEM with 7% calf serum. Experiments were conducted in 0.5% calf serum. In cardiomyocytes, AngII receptor expression was (AT1 5.9 ± 0.5, AT2 4.0 ± 0.9 fmol/106 cells,n = 4). Cell viability was assessed by trypan blue exclusion assay. Whole cell ligand binding assay was performed on cultured cells seeded in 12-well plates. AT1 and AT2receptor binding was assessed by incubating the cells for 1 h at 37 °C with 0.2 nm of125I-[Sar1, Ile8]AngII in the presence or absence of 1 μm of PD123319 or losartan as a competitor, respectively. Cells were then washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin and lysed in 0.5 n NaOH and gamma counted. Ceramide was quantified as described previously (10Dressler K.A. Kolesnick R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14917-14921Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In brief, cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS, frozen with liquid nitrogen, and scraped. Lipids were extracted according to the method described by Bligh and Dyer (11Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Physiol. Pharmacol. 1959; 37: 911-916Crossref Google Scholar). Lipids were alkaline hydrolyzed for 1 h with 0.1n methanolic KOH and reextracted. Ceramide levels were determined in mixed micellar conditions and quantitatively converted to ceramide-1-phosphate by E. colidiacylglycerol kinase. The labeled ceramide-1-phosphate was resolved by thin layer chromatography (TLC) (silica gel 60 plates) with a solvent system consisting of chloroform/methanol/acetic acid (65:15:5, v/v/v). Quantification of ceramide was performed using a standard curve of known amounts of ceramide. Cell number was determined by hemacytometer. [1-14C]stearic acid (10 μCi) was dried under N2, resuspended in 100:l of the medium, sonicated, and added to the cells. Cells were prelabeled for 24 h before AngII stimulation, and [1-14C]stearic acid (10 μCi) was also present during AngII stimulation. At the indicated times, cells were washed with ice-cold PBS, frozen with liquid nitrogen, and then scraped. The samples were extracted and alkaline hydrolyzed as described above. 1-14C-labeled ceramide was resolved by TLC on silica gel 60 plates using a solvent system of chloroform/methanol/acetic acid/water (85:4.5:5:0.5) and were detected by comigration of ceramide standards (12Quintans J.

Dawson G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9868-9876Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Changes in sphingomyelin levels were measured by [3H]choline (75 Ci/mmol) labeling as described previously (14Bose R. Verheij M. Haimovitz-Friedman A. Scotto K. Fuks Z. Kolesnick R.N. Cell. 1995; 82: 405-414Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (786) Google Scholar). PC12W cells were incubated with [3H]choline (1 μCi/ml in cell culture medium) for three passages. The procedures of extraction and alkalinic hydrolysis were identical to those used for ceramide determination. Sphingomyelin was resolved by TLC on silica gel 60 plates using a solvent system consisting of chloroform/methanol/acetic acid/water (50:30:8:3) and was quantified by liquid scintillation counting. Cells were washed in ice-cold PBS, pelleted, and homogenized in 20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, and 1 mm EDTA containing 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mmaprotinin. The homogenate was centrifuged at 4,000 ×g. Neutral sphingomyelinase activity was assayed with 20 nm [methyl-14C]sphingomyelin in 0.2% Triton X-100, 80 mm MgCl2, and 100 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, as described previously (15Santana P. Pena L.A. Haimovitz-Friedman A. Martin S. Green D. McLoughlin M. Cordon-Cardo C. Schuchman E.H. Fuks Z. Kolesnick R. Cell. 1996; 86: 189-199Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (729) Google Scholar). TNF-α (30 ng/ml) and boiled samples were used as positive and negative controls, respectively. After 1 h of incubation, the reaction was stopped by 1.5 ml of chloroform/methanol (2:1), vortexed, and centrifuged to separate phases. The upper phase was counted by liquid scintillation counting. Acid sphingomyelinase activity was measured as above except that 100 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.5, replaced Tris/HCl. Sphingosine was quantified as described previously (16Olivera A. Rosenthal J. Spiegel S. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 223: 306-312Crossref Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The enzyme was prepared from Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts. In brief, cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS, frozen with liquid nitrogen and scraped. Lipids were extracted according to the method described by Bligh and Dyer (11Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Physiol. Pharmacol. 1959; 37: 911-916Crossref Google Scholar). Assay was performed in lipids solubilized in bovine serum albumin. Sphingosine was quantitatively converted enzymatically to sphingosine 1-phosphate and then the labeled sphingosine 1-phosphate was resolved by TLC with a solvent system consisting of 1-butanol/methanol/acetic acid/water (80:20:10:20, v/v/v) or chloroform/methanol/acetic acid/water (90:90:15:6, v/v/v). Quantification was performed by adding known amounts of sphingosine. PC12W were prelabeled with [14C]serine (1 μCi/ml) in serine-free medium for 24 h followed by AngII stimulation in the presence of [14C]serine (1 μCi/ml) for 24 h. Cells were washed with ice-cold PBS, scraped, and centrifuged at 6,000 rpm for 10 min. Total lipids were extracted from the pellet with 3 ml of chloroform/methanol/water/pyridine (60:30:6:1) for 48 h at 50 °C (17Van Echten G. Birk R. Brenner-Weiss G. Schmidt R.R. Sandhoff K. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 9333-9339Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The extract was treated with methanolic KOH 100 mm for 1 h at 37 °C. Then lipids were desalted by reverse-phase chromatography (18Williams M.A. McCluer R.H. J. Neurochem. 1980; 35: 266-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar), applied to TLC plates, and chromatographed with chloroform/methanol/0.22% aqueous CaCl2 (60:35:8, v/v/v). TLC plates were exposed for 5–7 days in −70 °C. Enzymatic activity was determined by measuring the incorporation ofl-[3-14C]serine into 3-ketosphinganine. The samples were processed and the assay was performed as described previously (19Merrill A.H. Wang E. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 209: 427-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The assay was performed in 0.1 m Hepes (pH 7.4), 5 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm EDTA, 50 μm pyridoxal 5′-phosphate, 0.15 mmpalmitoyl-CoA, and 1 mm14C-labeledl-serine in a total volume of 0.1 ml at 37 °C for 10 min and was terminated by 1.5 ml of chloroform/methanol 1:2. Boiled samples, samples without palmitoyl-CoA, and samples containing 10 mm β-chloro-l-alanine served as negative controls. To extract 3-ketosphinganine, 25 μg of sphinganine was added as a carrier. The phases were separated, and the lower phase was washed twice with water. The chloroform soluble material was either scintillation counted or run on TLC using silica gel plates with chloroform/methanol/2 n NH4OH (40:10:1) as a solvent. PC12W were serum starved for 24 h. Then these cells were stimulated by 10 ng/ml NGF for 10 min with or without PD98059, washed two times with ice-cold PBS, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and scraped. Phosphorylated ERK was detected using anti-phospho-ERK antibodies (New England Biolabs), visualized by enzyme-linked chemiluminescence (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and quantified using scanning densitometry. The PC12W cells were seeded into 6-well plates at 5 × 105 cells/well. Morphological changes in the nuclear chromatin of apoptotic cells were determined by staining with bis-benzimide (Hoechst 33342) and propidium iodide. A minimum of 500 cells were scored for the apoptotic chromatin changes (condensation of chromatin, its compaction into periphery of the nucleus, and segmentation of the nucleus into more than three fragments). Data are expressed as percentage of apoptotic cells in total counted cells. Oligosomal fragmentation of PC12W genomic DNA was measured using cells seeded on 6-well plates as described (20Tilly J.L. Hsueh A.J.W. J. Cell. Physiol. 1993; 154: 519-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). The amount of [α-32P]dideoxyATP incorporated into low molecular weight (<20 kilobase pairs) DNA fraction was quantified by cutting the respective fraction of DNA from the dried gel and scintillation counted. Changes in caspase 3 activity were measured using synthetic tetrapeptide Asp-Glu-Val-Asp (DEVD) coupled top-nitroaniline as a substrate (Apoalert kit,CLONTECH). PC12W cells were seeded on 6-well plates and for each caspase 3 activity determination, 2 × 106 cells were used. At appropriate time points, cells were washed with ice-cold PBS and frozen in liquid nitrogen. The samples were processed according to the manufacturer's instructions. Results are expressed as mean ± S.E. and were obtained by combining data from three to six independent experiments. Statistical significance was assessed by Student'st test. We used PC12W cells that express high levels of AT2 receptor but no AT1 receptor. PC12W cells were maintained in serum-free medium in the presence of 10 ng/ml NGF, which protects these cells from apoptosis. Incubation of PC12W cells with AngII for 48 h resulted in the appearance of typical morphological changes of apoptosis such as nuclear condensation and chromatin fragmentation, and the number of apoptotic cells increased from 3.1 ± 1.1% to 11.9 ± 2.5% (n = 4, p < 0.01). The apoptotic effect of AngII (10−7m) in these cells was blocked by 10−5m of the AT2 receptor-specific antagonist PD123319 but not by the AT1 receptor antagonist losartan (10−5m). The effect of endogenously produced angiotensin II on apoptosis was controlled by checking whether PD123319 (10−5m) would affect the basal level of apoptosis. No effect could be observed suggesting that the endogenously produced AngII has no major functional significance. The time-course of DNA fragmentation revealed that an increase in apoptosis became apparent at 24 h after the addition of AngII (10−7m). At maximum, nearly 4-fold increase in DNA fragmentation was observed 48 h after AngII stimulation. In control cells maintained under NGF without AngII, almost no DNA fragmentation was detected (Fig. 1 A). Moreover, the stimulation of AT2 receptor resulted in the activation of caspase 3 that preceded the onset of DNA fragmentation (Fig.1 B). We observed that the addition of membrane permeable C2-ceramide (100 μm) led to approximately 30% apoptosis after 24 h (data not shown), suggesting that ceramide in fact exerts direct proapoptotic effect in PC12W cells. To test the hypothesis that ceramide is involved in the mechanism of AT2 receptor-induced apoptosis, we measured the time-course of ceramide production after AngII stimulation. Early time points saw no substantial changes in ceramide formation by AngII stimulation. Accumulation of ceramide was detectable 18 h after AngII stimulation, reached a peak at 24 h, and was sustained for at least 48 h (Fig. 2). Compared with control cells, AngII (10−7m) stimulation increased cellular ceramide content 4-fold at 24 h. In addition, metabolic labeling experiments were performed in which cells were prelabeled with [3H]stearic acid for 24 h before AngII stimulation. In accordance with diacylglycerol kinase assay, AT2 receptor-induced ceramide increase after 24 h of AngII stimulation was 3.7-fold. Sphingosine levels were only modestly affected by 24 h of AngII stimulation, and sphingosine increased from 25.8 ± 7.0 to 41.6 ± 9.2 pmol/106 cells (n = 3, p = not significant). To study whether AngII-induced ceramide increase occurs in other cell systems, we studied rat neonatal cardiomyocytes. AngII (10−7m) in the presence of losartan (10−5m) causes (297 ± 51% of control, n = 4) increase in DNA laddering, and no increase occurred in the presence of AngII and PD123319 (10−5m). In cardiomyocytes, 24 h of AngII stimulation increased ceramide levels 4-fold. Elevation in intracellular ceramide in PC12W preceded caspase 3 activation and the appearance of DNA fragmentation. The evidence presented above indicates that there is a temporal association between AT2 receptor-induced ceramide accumulation and apoptosis. Ceramide can be derived from complex SLs or fromde novo biosynthesis. We first tested the hypothesis that AT2 receptor induces an elevation in intracellular ceramide by activating sphingomyelin hydrolysis. We measured both acidic and neural sphingomyelinase activity in cell lysates at various time points and could not detect any effect by AT2 receptor activation (Fig. 3 A). Sphingomyelin/ceramide molar ratio in our system is approximately 7:1, and therefore ceramide increase from 50 to 200 pmol/106cells would require approximately 40% turnover of sphingomyelin pool. In accordance with sphingomyelinase data, no sphingomyelin breakdown was detected by AT2 receptor stimulation in [3H]choline-labeled PC12W cells up to 24 h (Fig.3 B). In addition, we analyzed the effect of 24 h of AngII stimulation on glycolipids. Cellular lipids were prelabeled with [14C]serine for 24 h before AngII stimulation and during treatment. Short chained glycosphingolipids such as glucosylceramide and lactosylceramide were well separated, and no changes in the levels of these lipids were observed. In addition, no changes in the levels of sphingomyelin or various gangliosides were observed (data not shown). Taken together, our results suggest that ceramide is not derived from complex SLs. These findings prompted us to explore the de novo biosynthetic pathway by measuring serine palmitoyltransferase activity that is the rate-limiting reaction inde novo sphingolipid synthesis (21Merrill Jr., A.H. Wang E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 261: 3764-3769Google Scholar, 22Mandon E.C. Echten G. Birk R. Schmidt R.R. Sandhoff K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 198: 667-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). We observed 2-fold increase in the activity of this enzyme after 24 h of stimulation (Fig. 3 C). To block the de novo pathway, we measured the ceramide levels at 24 h after AngII stimulation in the presence or absence of 5 mm βCA and 10 μm FB1. At these concentrations, both βCA and FB1 completely block the de novo pathway (23Wang E. Norred W.P. Bacon C.W. Riley R.T. Merrill A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14486-14490Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Merrill Jr., A.H. van Echten G. Wang E. Sandhoff K. J. Biol.

Ceramide measurement demonstrated that both βCA and FB1 blocked the effect of AT2 receptor on ceramide production (Fig. 4 A). Interestingly, similar results using 10:M FB1 was observed in rat neonatal cardiomyocytes where AT2 receptor-induced ceramide production was blocked by FB1 suggesting that the ceramide pathway is not cell-type specific. Treatment of PC12W cells with doses of FB1 and βCA and up to 10 μmand 5 mm, respectively, in the absence of AngII for as long as 48 h, did not affect cell viability (data not shown), agreeing with the results of other studies (14Bose R. Verheij M. Haimovitz-Friedman A. Scotto K. Fuks Z. Kolesnick R.N. Cell. 1995; 82: 405-414Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (786) Google Scholar, 23Wang E. Norred W.P. Bacon C.W. Riley R.T.

The amount of [32P]dideoxyATP incorporated into low molecular weight (<20 kilobases) DNA fraction was quantified by cutting the respective fraction of agarose gel (mean ± S.E., n = 3 for each condition). * p < 0.05 and ** p< 0.01 versus control.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The evidence presented above indicates that there is a correlation between ceramide accumulation and apoptosis. To examine the role of ceramide in AT2 receptor-mediated apoptosis, we investigated whether AT2 receptor-generated apoptotic signals could be interrupted by βCA or FB1. AT2 receptor-mediated increase in DNA fragmentation was attenuated in a concentration-dependent manner and abolished by 10 μm FB1 and by 5 mm βCA (Fig.4 C). We performed nuclear staining and observed that FB1 decreased the number of apoptotic nuclei in an analogous manner to DNA fragmentation, and the number of apoptotic cells decreased from (3.1 ± 1.1%, no AngII) 11.9 ± 2.5%, 5.5 ± 0.23%, 4.2 ± 0.20%, 4.1 ± 0.60% (mean ± S.E., n = 6 for each condition) by 0, 0.1, 1, and 10 μm FB1, respectively. Interestingly, similar results using 10 μm FB1 was observed in rat neonatal cardiomyocytes where AT2 receptor-induced apoptosis was blocked by FB1 suggesting that the activation of de novo biosynthesis of SLs may mediate apoptosis also in neonatal cardiomyocytes. Our previous studies (4Yamada T. Horiuchi M. Dzau V.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 156-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (667) Google Scholar) have established that in PC12W cells the AngII-induced apoptosis is PTX- and vanadate-sensitive. We therefore examined whether these compounds block the apoptosis by modulating the ceramide response. In agreement with the previous studies, AngII stimulation did not induce apoptotic nuclear changes in PC12W cells pretreated with 200 ng/ml PTX for 24 h (Fig.5). Ceramide levels were also measured in PTX-treated cells at 24 h after AT2 receptor stimulation, and no elevation in ceramide levels was detected (Fig. 5). Given that the AT2 receptor-induced apoptotic cell death is mediated by a tyrosine phosphatase-dependent mechanism, we treated PC12W cells for 24 h with 100:M orthovanadate before AngII (10−7m) stimulation and confirmed that AngII did not induce any apoptotic nuclear changes (Fig. 5). As shown in Fig.5, orthovanadate almost completely blocked AngII-induced elevation in cellular ceramide levels. In contrast, okadaic acid did not demonstrate any effect on apoptosis induced by AT2 receptor nor did it influence AT2 receptor-induced ceramide generation (data not shown). ERK inhibition by AT2 receptor results is a central part of AT2 receptor signaling (4Yamada T. Horiuchi M. Dzau V.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 156-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (667) Google Scholar, 26Bedecs K.N. Elbaz N. Sutren M. Masson M. Susini C. Strosberg A.D. Nahmias C. Biochem. J. 1997; 325: 449-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined the possibility that ERK inhibition induces ceramide accumulation in PC12W cells maintained under NGF (10 ng/ml). In ERK phosphorylation assay 1, 10, and 100 μm PD98059 reduced NGF (10 ng/ml) stimulated phosphorylation by 20, 45, and 65%, respectively (Fig.6). Inhibition of ERK by 45% had no effect, and 65% inhibition caused a 2-fold increase in DNA fragmentation. Interestingly, PD98059 did not cause any changes in ceramide levels (Fig. 6). Time-course analysis of AT2 receptor-stimulated ceramide accumulation revealed no early increase, rather a late ceramide increase starting 18 h after AT2 receptor stimulation that was followed by caspase 3 activation and DNA fragmentation. This is in accordance with a large body of evidence suggesting that ceramide can be placed upstream of the executioner caspase 3-like proteases (27Tepper A.D. Boesen-de Cock J.G.R. de Vries E. Borst J. van Blitterwijk W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24308-24312Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Interestingly, previously published studies (13Wiesner D.A. Kilkus J.P. Gottschalk A.R. Quintans J. Dawson G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9868-9876Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 28Gamard C.J. Dbaibo G.S. Liu B. Obeid L.M. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16474-16481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) have reported that Fas ligand induces delayed ceramide accumulation that precedes the onset of apoptosis. The mechanism of ceramide accumulation following AT2 receptor stimulation does not appear to be secondary to the sphingomyelinase pathway nor to glycosphingolipid breakdown. Therefore, we examined if the de novo pathway of sphingolipid synthesis would be involved (23Wang E. Norred W.P. Bacon C.W. Riley R.T. Merrill A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14486-14490Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Michel C. van Echten-Deckert G. Rother J. Sandhoff K. Wang E. Merrill Jr., A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22432-22437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). We found serine palmitoyltransferase, the rate-limiting step ofde novo pathway, to be activated by AT2 receptor suggesting that the accelerated de novo sphingolipid synthesis could mediate AT2 receptor-induced apoptosis. Daunorubicin and in some instances TNF-α have been shown to cause apoptosis by accelerating ceramide synthesis via the activation ofde novo pathway (14Bose R. Verheij M. Haimovitz-Friedman A. Scotto K. Fuks Z. Kolesnick R.N. Cell. 1995; 82: 405-414Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (786) Google Scholar, 30Xu J. Yeh C.H. Chen S. He L. Sensi S.L. Canzoniero L.M.T. Choi D.W. Hsu C.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16521-16526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). We examined the effects of two inhibitors of de novo pathway, βCA (inhibitor of serine palmitoyltransferase) and FB1 (inhibitor of ceramide synthase). FB1 is a specific inhibitor de novosphingolipid synthesis, but it results in the accumulation of sphinganine. Sphinganine has been reported to be biologically active and could potentially modulate apoptosis (31Schroeder J.J. Crane H.M. Xia J. Liotta D.C. Merrill Jr., A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3475-3481Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32Smith E.R. Jones P.L. Boss J.M. Merrill Jr., A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5640-5646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). However, it has been shown that in contrast to sphingosine 1-phosphate, sphinganine 1-phosphate appears not to be antiapoptotic in PC12 cells (33Van Brocklyn J.R. Lee M.-J. Menzeleev R. Olivera A. Edsall L. Cuvillier O. Thomas D.M. Coopman P.J.P. Thangada S. Liu C.H. Hla T. Spiegel S. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 229-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). βCA does not cause accumulation of SL metabolites (25Medlock K.A. Merrill Jr., A.H. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 7079-7084Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Both of these inhibitors strongly attenuated the generation of ceramide induced by AT2 receptor stimulation, suggesting that the activation ofde novo SL synthesis is required for ceramide accumulation. We tested the functional significance of de novo SL synthesis in AT2 receptor signal transduction by using FB1 and βCA and found that both inhibited the AT2 receptor-induced apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner, and the required concentrations were in accordance with the IC50 of FB1 or βCA (23Wang E. Norred W.P. Bacon C.W. Riley R.T. Merrill A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14486-14490Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Medlock K.A. Merrill Jr., A.H. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 7079-7084Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Thus, AT2 receptor stimulation induced an acceleration of de novo sphingolipid synthesis leading to an accumulation of ceramide or some other sphingolipid metabolite, which then promotes apoptotic cell death. The effect of AT2receptor stimulation on SL is not cell type specific as similar effects were observed in rat neonatal cardiomyocytes. Both pertussis toxin- and vanadate-inhibited AT2 receptor stimulated ceramide accumulation thus suggesting that both G protein and tyrosine phosphatase activation are essential in controlling the accelerated ceramide synthesis (4Yamada T. Horiuchi M. Dzau V.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 156-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (667) Google Scholar, 6Horiuchi M. Hayashida W. Kambe T. Yamada T. Dzau V.J. J. Biol.

Commun. 1996; 228: 825-830Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The alternative mechanism for the effect of vanadate is ceramidase activation that may independently of AT2 receptor activation reduce ceramide levels (35Nikolova-Karakashian M. Morgan E.T. Alexander C. Liotta D.C. Merrill Jr., A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18718-18724Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Our group and others have previously identified ERK as one of the downstream effectors for AT2 receptor (4Yamada T. Horiuchi M. Dzau V.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 156-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (667) Google Scholar). ERK inhibition by AT2 receptor is a rapid response that occurs within minutes after receptor activation and returns back to baseline within 30 min, thus occurring before an increase in ceramide levels. In PC12 cells, the inhibition of ERK is an essential step in growth factor deprivation-induced apoptosis (36Xia Z. Dickens M. Raingeard J. Davis R.J. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1995; 270: 1326-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (5045) Google Scholar). We used MEK inhibitor PD98059 to attenuate NGF-stimulated ERK activity and found that it did not cause any increase in ceramide levels, suggesting that ERK inhibition alone is not sufficient to enhance ceramide production. Although AT2 receptor-induced apoptosis and ceramide accumulation correlate well, AT2 receptor-induced apoptosis could be mediated by another sphingolipid metabolite. This could also explain why PD98059 does not induce ceramide accumulation but induces apoptosis. Our principal findings are that AT2 receptor activation induces the activation de novo biosynthesis of SLs and an accumulation of ceramide. Our data support the hypothesis that sphingolipid metabolite(s) is (are) involved in AT2receptor-induced apoptosis. The changes in ceramide correlate well with apoptosis, however, this does not directly prove that ceramide is the true mediator.

Replacement of Arg-120 of ovine PGHS-1 with a glutamine increases the apparentK m of PGHS-1 for arachidonate by 1,000-fold (Bhattacharyya, D. K., Lecomte, M., Rieke, C. J., Garavito, R. M., and Smith, W. L. (1996) J. Biol. Chem. 271, 2179–2184). This and other evidence indicate that the guanido group of Arg-120 forms an ionic bond with the carboxylate group of arachidonate and that this interaction is an important contributor to the overall strength of arachidonate binding to PGHS-1. In contrast, we report here that R120Q human PGHS-2 (hPGHS-2) and native hPGHS-2 have very similar kinetic properties, but R120L hPGHS-2 catalyzes the oxygenation of arachidonate inefficiently. Our data indicate that the guanido group of Arg-120 of hPGHS-2 interacts with arachidonate through a hydrogen bond rather than an ionic bond and that this interaction is much less important for arachidonate binding to PGHS-2 than to PGHS-1. The K m values of PGHS-1 and -2 for arachidonate are the same, and all but one of the core residues of the active sites of the two isozymes are identical. Thus, the results of our studies of Arg-120 of PGHS-1 and -2 imply that interactions involved in the binding of arachidonate to PGHS-1 and -2 are quite different and that residues within the hydrophobic cyclooxygenase channel must contribute more significantly to arachidonate binding to PGHS-2 than to PGHS-1. As observed previously with R120Q PGHS-1, flurbiprofen was an ineffective inhibitor of R120Q hPGHS-2. PGHS-2-specific inhibitors including NS398, DuP-697, and SC58125 had IC50 values for the R120Q mutant that were up to 1,000-fold less than those observed for native hPGHS-2; thus, the positively charged guanido group of Arg-120 interferes with the binding of these compounds. NS398 did not cause time-dependent inhibition of R120Q hPGHS-2, whereas DuP-697 and SC58125 were time-dependent inhibitors. Thus, Arg-120 is important for the time-dependent inhibition of hPGHS-2 by NS398 but not by DuP-697 or SC58125.

PGHS-1 is expressed constitutively in most tissues, and PGH2 formed via PGHS-1 is involved in modulating and coordinating intercellular, intratissue responses to fluctuations in the levels of circulating hormones. PGHS-2 is expressed inducibly in response to cytokines (2Raz A. Wyche A. Jiyi F. Seibert K. Needleman P. Samuelsson B. Advances in Prostaglandin, Thromboxane, and Lekotriene Research. 20.

Both PGHS-1 and PGHS-2 have similar kinetic and structural properties (1Smith W.L. Garavito R.M. DeWitt D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33157-33160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1838) Google Scholar). Both isoforms catalyze two distinct reactions: (a) a cyclooxygenase reaction involving thebis-oxygenation of arachidonic acid to yield PGG2, and (b) a peroxidase reaction involving a two-electron reduction of the 15-hydroperoxyl group of PGG2to form PGH2. PGH2, in turn, is further metabolized to the individual prostaglandins, prostacyclins, and thromboxanes by the appropriate synthases (1Smith W.L. Garavito R.M. DeWitt D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33157-33160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1838) Google Scholar). PGHSs are the therapeutic targets of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as aspirin and ibuprofen, and as such, they are the focus of research on mechanisms of catalysis and inhibition. Examination of the crystal structure of ovine PGHS-1 (oPGHS-1) complexed with flurbiprofen established that Arg-120 is positioned near the mouth of the hydrophobic tunnel that forms the cyclooxygenase active site and suggested that this residue interacts with the carboxylate groups of various nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and fatty acid substrates (12Picot D. Loll P.J. Garavito M. Nature. 1994; 367: 243-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (1144) Google Scholar, 13Loll P.J. Picot D. Garavito R.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 637-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). Kinetic analyses of Arg-120 mutants of oPGHS-1 have been consistent with this hypothesis and indicate that an ionic interaction between the carboxylate group of arachidonate and the guanido group of Arg-120 is a major determinant of substrate and inhibitor binding to this isozyme (14Bhattacharyya D.K.

The homologous Arg-120 (Arg-106) 2Arg-106 of hPGHS-2 is homologous to Arg-120 of oPGHS-1. The numbering of Arg-106 in hPGHS-2 is based on numbering the amino-terminal methionine of the signal peptide as residue number 1. In this study, we number homologous residues of PGHS-2 in parallel with oPGHS-1; accordingly, Arg-106 of hPGHS-2 is numbered as Arg-120. 2Arg-106 of hPGHS-2 is homologous to Arg-120 of oPGHS-1.

In this study, we number homologous residues of PGHS-2 in parallel with oPGHS-1; accordingly, Arg-106 of hPGHS-2 is numbered as Arg-120. residue in human PGHS-2 (hPGHS-2) and murine PGHS-2 (mPGHS-2) is also postulated to interact with fatty acid substrates and carboxylic acid-containing inhibitors in a manner analogous to that observed for Arg-120 of oPGHS-1 (16Kurumbail R.G.

To determine if this is the case, we replaced Arg-120 of hPGHS-2 with glutamine and leucine and examined the kinetic properties of the mutant enzymes with a variety of fatty acid substrates and inhibitors. Our data suggest that the Arg-120 residue of PGHS-2 forms a hydrogen bond and not an ionic linkage with the carboxyl group of arachidonate, that the interaction of arachidonate with Arg-120 is quantitatively much less important for substrate binding to PGHS-2 than to PGHS-1; this, in turn, implies that hydrophobic residues in the core of the cyclooxygenase active site of PGHS-2 are relatively more important for substrate binding than is the case for PGHS-1. In examining the role of Arg-120 in the interaction of PGHS-2 with PGHS-2-specific inhibitors, this residue was found to be important in time-dependent inhibition by some, but not all, inhibitors. We interpret our data in the context of a model for substrate and inhibitor binding to hPGHS-2. Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium was from Life Technologies, Inc. Fetal calf serum and calf serum were from Hyclone. Chloroquine, bovine hemoglobin, DEAE-dextran, and penicillin G were from Sigma. CsCl was from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. The fatty acids 20:4n-6, 18:2n-6, 20:5n-3, 20:2n-6, and 20:3n-6 were from Cayman Chemical Co. [1-14C]Arachidonic acid (50–55 mCi/mmol) was from NEN Life Science Products. All other reagents were purchased from common commercial sources. Mutants of hPGHS-2 mutants were prepared using a Bio-Rad Muta-Gene kit essentially as described previously (19Lecomte M. Laneuville O. Ji C. DeWitt D.L. Smith W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13207-13215Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). M13mp19-hPGHS-2, which contains the coding region of hPGHS-2, was mutated following instructions supplied by the manufacturer. The single-stranded M13 phage samples were sequenced using the dideoxy method to identify mutants (20Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52495) Google Scholar). The 1.8-kilobase insert from the replicative form of M13mp19-PGHS-2 containing the desired mutation was isolated bySalI digestion and subcloned into the SalI site of pOSML (19Lecomte M. Laneuville O. Ji C. DeWitt D.L. Smith W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13207-13215Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The correct orientation was confirmed by restriction mapping with PstI. The double-stranded pOSML-hPGHS-2 mutant plasmids were sequenced to confirm that the mutations were present in the plasmids used for transfections. Plasmids were purified by CsCl gradient ultracentrifugation as described previously. The oligonucleotide primers used to prepare the mutants were 5′-GTGTTGACATCCCAGTCACATTTGATT-3′ for R120Q and 5′ -GTGTTGACATCCCTATCACATTTG-3′ for R120L. COS-1 cells (ATCC CRL-1650) were grown to near confluence in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 8% calf serum and 2% fetal calf serum in a water-saturated 5% CO2 atmosphere. Approximately 16 h before the transfections, the cells were subcultured 1:2. The COS-1 cells were transfected using the DEAE-dextran/chloroquine method as described previously (19Lecomte M. Laneuville O. Ji C. DeWitt D.L. Smith W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13207-13215Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Laneuville O. Breuer D.K. DeWitt D.L. Hla T. Funk C.D. Smith W.L. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1994; 271: 927-934PubMed Google Scholar). Forty h after transfection, the cells were harvested using a rubber policeman to scrape them into 3 ml of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and collected by centrifugation at 1,000 × g for 5 min. Transfected cells from 20–50 tissue culture plates (100 mm) were resuspended in 4–5 ml of ice-cold 0.1 m Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, and disrupted by sonication. The sonicated cells were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and the resulting supernatants were centrifuged at 200,000 × g for 50 min in a Beckman SW50.1 rotor to yield microsomal membranes. These membranes were resuspended by homogenization in a volume of 0.1m Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, sufficient to yield a final protein concentration of about 5 mg/ml. Protein concentrations were determined by a modified Lowry method, using bovine serum albumin as the standard (22Markwell M.A.K. Haas S.M. Bieber L.L. Tolbert N.E. Anal. Biochem. 1978; 87: 206-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (5307) Google Scholar). Cyclooxygenase assays were performed at 37 °C using a Yellow Springs Instruments Model 5300 oxygen electrode. A typical assay contained 3 ml of 0.1m Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, with 1 mm phenol, 100 μm arachidonate, and 85 μg of bovine hemoglobin (as a source of heme). Reactions were typically initiated by the addition of enzyme to the chamber, and initial rates of oxygen consumption were determined. To measure instantaneous inhibition, NSAIDs were added at the appropriate concentration to the assay chamber before the addition of enzyme. For measurements of time-dependent inhibition, NSAIDs, at the appropriate concentrations, were preincubated with 250 μg of microsomal protein at 37 °C for various times, reactions were initiated by the addition of the enzyme/inhibitor sample to the assay chamber, and initial rates of oxygen consumption were determined. For studies of substrate specificity, concentrations of 100 μm 20:5n-3, 18:2n-6, 20:3n-6, or 20:2n-6 were used.K m determinations were performed for 20:4n-6, 20:5n-3, and 18:2n-6 using varying concentrations of these substrates. Peroxidase assays of COS-1 cell microsomal protein preparations were performed spectrophotometrically using a Perkin-Elmer model 552A Double Beam UV/VIS spectrophotometer measuring the oxidation of 3,3,3′,3′- tetramethylphenylenediamine at 611 nm (23Kulmacz R.J. Prostaglandins. 1987; 34: 225-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 24DeWitt D.L. el-Harith E.A. Kraemer S.A. Andrews M.J. Yao E.F. Armstrong R.L. Smith W.L. J. Biol.

Microsomal membranes were resolved by one-dimensional SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred electrophoretically to 0.45-mm nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher & Schuell). Membranes were blocked for 0.5–12 h in 3% (w/v) dry milk and 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20/Tris-buffered saline, followed by an incubation with a 1:3,000 dilution of an affinity-purified antibody to the 18-amino acid cassette unique to PGHS-2 (25Otto J.C. Smith W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19868-19875Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in 1% dry milk and 0.1% Tween 20/Tris-buffered saline for 2 h at 25 °C. Membranes were washed and incubated with a 1:1,000 dilution of a goat anti-rabbit IgG horseradish peroxidase for 1 h. The membrane was washed and incubated with Amersham Pharmacia Biotech ECL reagents and exposed to Kodak XAR film for chemiluminescence. Microsomal membrane suspensions (250 μg of protein for native and R120Q hPGHS-2 and 1 mg of protein for R120L hPGHS-2) were incubated with 100 μm [1-14C]arachidonic acid for 10 min in 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 1 μm hematin and 1 mm phenol. The reactions were stopped by the addition of 1.4 ml of chloroform:methanol (1:1, v/v) and centrifuged at 3,000 rpm for 5 min. The supernatants were transferred to clean tubes, and 0.6 ml of chloroform and 0.32 ml of 0.88% formic acid were added. After centrifugation, the organic layer was removed and dried under N2. The dried samples were redissolved in 50 μl of chloroform and spotted on Silica Gel 60 thin layer chromatography plates. Plates were developed twice in benzene:dioxane:acetic acid:formic acid (82:14:1:1, v/v/v/v) and exposed to XAR-5 film for 48 h to visualize the products. Prostaglandin synthesis by hPGHS-2 and the R120 mutant enzymes was quantified by densitometry using a Molecular Dynamics Storm 820 PhosphorImager with ImageQuant software. The relative amounts of 11- and 15-HETE were also quantified by reverse phase-HPLC. Native or mutant oPGHS-1 (1 mg of microsomal protein) was reacted with 100 μm arachidonic acid for 30 min at 37 °C. The products were collected as described above, dried under N2, and resuspended in HPLC buffer (0.1% aqueous acetic acid/acetonitrile containing 0.1% acetic acid; 1:1, v/v). 15- and 11-HETEs were separated by reverse phase-HPLC using a C-18 column purchased from Vydac Co. and detected with a Waters Model 600 HPLC equipped with a 990 photo diode array detector set to 234 nm. The strong component of the mobile phase was 0.1% aqueous acetic acid, and the eluting solvent was acetonitrile containing 0.1% acetic acid. The flow rate was 1 ml/min. The following elution profile was used: 0–30 min, 30% acetonitrile; 30–100 min, 50% acetonitrile; 100–125 min, 75% acetonitrile; and 125–130 min, 100% acetonitrile. The retention times for 15-HETE and 11-HETE were 36 and 38 min, respectively. The relative amounts of 11-HETE and 15-HETE were determined by measuring the area associated with each peak. hPGHS-2, R120Q hPGHS-2, and R120L hPGHS-2 were expressed transiently in COS-1 cells. As shown in Fig.1, quantitative Western transfer blotting established that hPGHS-2, R120Q hPGHS-2, and R120L hPGHS-2 were present at essentially identical levels in microsomes prepared from the transfected COS-1 cells and that there was no immunoreactive hPGHS-2 in sham-transfected cells. Table I provides a tabulation of the results of the product analyses derived from the quantitation of radio thin layer chromatograms of the products formed upon incubation of hPGHS-2, R120Q hPGHS-2, and R120L hPGHS-2 with [1-14C]arachidonic acid. The native and mutant enzymes formed a similar mixture of prostanoid products, but both R120Q hPGHS-2 and R120L hPGHS-2 formed about 1.5 times more 11-HETE as the native enzyme 3Previous studies on the stereochemistry of the 11-HETE formed by hPGHS-2 (39Xiao G. Tsai A.-L. Palmer G. Boyar W.C. Marshal P.J. Kulmacz R.J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1836-1845Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) established that this monohydroxy fatty acid product has the R configuration. Similarly, the 11-HETE formed by a variety of oPGHS-1 mutants has been found to be 11R-HETE (E. D. Thuresson, K. M. Lakkides, and W. L. Smith, unpublished results). 11R-HETE would be expected from antarafacial oxygen insertion associated with abstraction of either the 13 pro-S or 13 pro-R hydrogen from arachidonic acid. ; when the 11-HETE and 15-HETE products were separated and quantified by reverse phase-HPLC, the ratios of 11-HETE to 15-HETE were determined to be 0.79 for native hPGHS-2 and 1.5 for both R120Q hPGHS-2 and R120L hPGHS-2 (i.e. approximately the same ratios found using radio thin layer chromatography (Table I)). Also summarized in Table I are kinetic data for the native and mutant enzymes. hPGHS-2 and R120Q hPGHS-2 have virtually identical kinetic properties with arachidonate as substrate; moreover, the peroxidase activities of these mutants are quite similar. In contrast, R120L hPGHS-2 has considerably less peroxidase and cyclooxygenase activity than does the native enzyme. The R120Q mutant has a t12 for suicide inactivation of 22 s compared with 15 s for native hPGHS-2. R120L hPGHS-2 was also found to undergo suicide inactivation, but a t12was not determined for this mutant.Table IKinetic properties and product analyses of native hPGHS-2, R120Q hPGHS-2, and R120L hPGHS-2EnzymeCyclooxygenaseaV max values were determined using arachidonic acid as substrate as described in the text; values from different transfections ranged from 120 to 180 nmol of arachidonate consumed/min/mg of protein.PeroxidaseProductscDetermined by quantitative densitometry of autoradiographs of thin layer chromatograms of products formed using 100 μm [1-14C]arachidonate as described in the text.

In this initial screen, 20:5n-3 and 20:2n-6 were found to be particularly poor substrates for R120Q hPGHS-2 relative to hPGHS-2. Additional kinetic analyses of 18:2n-6 and 20:5n-3 indicated that 18:2n-6, like arachidonate, had similar kinetic properties with both native and R120Q hPGHS-2; however, with 20:5n-3, the K m was increased about 1,000-fold with the R120Q mutant. In a related experiment, 100 μm 22:6n-3, a relatively potent inhibitor of hPGHS-2 (21Laneuville O. Breuer D.K. DeWitt D.L. Hla T. Funk C.D. Smith W.L. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1994; 271: 927-934PubMed Google Scholar), was found not to inhibit R120Q hPGHS-2; this observation, coupled with the relatively high K m for 20:5n-3, suggested that 20:5n-3 might be unable to bind effectively to the cyclooxygenase active site of R120Q hPGHS-2; however, 100 μm 20:5 n-3 caused a 65% inhibition of the oxygenation of arachidonate (50 μm) by R120Q hPGHS-2 (versus a 90% inhibition of native hPGHS-2). Accordingly, we conclude that 20:5n-3 can bind with relatively similar affinities to the cyclooxygenase active sites of both native and R120Q hPGHS-2, but that the Arg-120 group of hPGHS-2 is in some way important for positioning 20:5n-3 for catalysis (i.e.removal of the 13 pro-S hydrogen).Table IICyclooxygenase substrate specificities of native hPGHS-2 and R120Q hPGHS-2SubstrateNative hPGHS-2 Cyclooxygenase kinetic valuesR120Q hPGHS-2 Cyclooxygenase kinetic valuesRate with 100 μmsubstrateVMax (% vs. 100 μm substrate)KMRate with 100 μm substrateVMax (%vs. 100) μmsubstrate)KM%μm%μm20:4n-610010881001101020:5n-345462.54124300020:3n-697NDND71NDND20:2n-618NDND0NDND18:2n-6607830607322V max and K m values for cyclooxygenase catalysis were determined with varying concentrations of 20:4n-6, 20:5n-3, and 18:2n-6, as described in the text.

Two hybrid systems have been used to identify novel components of signaling networks based on interactions with defined partner proteins. An important issue in the use of two-hybrid systems has been the degree to which interacting proteins distinguish their biological partner from evolutionarily conserved related proteins and the degree to which observed interactions are specific. We adapted the basic two-hybrid strategy to create a novel dual bait system designed to allow single-step screening of libraries for proteins that interact with protein 1 of interest, fused to DNA binding domain A (LexA), but do not interact with protein 2, fused to DNA binding domain B (λ cI). Using the selective interactions of Ras and Krev-1(Rap1A) with Raf, RalGDS, and Krit1 as a model, we systematically compared LexA- and cI-fused baits and reporters. The LexA and cI baitr reporter systems are well matched for level of bait expression and sensitivity range for interaction detection and allow effective isolation of specifically interacting protein pairs against a nonspecific background. These reagents should prove useful to refine the selectivity of library screens, to reduce the isolation of false positives in such screens, and to perform directed analyses of sequence elements governing the interaction of a single protein with multiple partners.

Interaction of this DBD protein fusion (a “bait”) with a transcriptional activation domain-fused partner protein (either a defined partner or a novel protein screened from a library) allows the activation of reporter genes (lacZ, HIS3, LEU2) responsive to the cognate DBD. More recently, interest has focused on expanding the utility of two-hybrid systems to enable the detection of interactions between proteins and RNA (6SenGupta D.J. Zhang B. Kraemer B. Pochart P.

Finally, there has been interest in developing two-hybrid systems as tools in high throughput drug discovery screening strategies to identify agents regulating the activity of biologically important target proteins.As two-hybrid technologies have evolved to more complex applications, a question of mounting importance has been the degree to which library screens performed in these systems yield partners specific for the utilized bait, as opposed to proteins of broad interaction capability (“false positives”). Although the large number of published two-hybrid papers indicates that many specific partners are obtained, a recent survey has suggested that the majority of library screens isolate at least some cDNAs that are nonspecific. 2I. Serebriiskii and E. A. Golemis, E. A. (1996)http://www.fccc.edu/ research/labs/golemis/interactiontrapinwork.html. 2I. Serebriiskii and E. A. Golemis, E. A. (1996)http://www.fccc.edu/ research/labs/golemis/interactiontrapinwork.html. As a related issue, it is clear that many biologically important proteins are organized into families of evolutionarily related members that conserve substantial sequence similarity (e.g. Refs. 17Alt F.W. DePinho R. Zimmerman K. LeGouy E. Hatton K. Ferrier P. Tesfaye A. Yancopoulos G. Nisen P. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1986; 51: 931-941Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Meyerson M.

Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 215-217Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Thus, the degree to which two-hybrid systems isolate proteins partners absolutely specific for individual baits, rather than those that interact generally with a class of protein (“familial positives”), is also an issue. Although existing two-hybrid systems allow discrimination of uniquely specific interactors from false positives or familial positives through use of various methods of specificity testing performed subsequent to a screen (20Golemis E.A. Serebriiskii I. Gyuris J. Brent R. Ausubel F.M. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1997: 20.1.1-20.1.35Google Scholar), these methods are frequently laborious, particularly when many possible interactors must be tested. For this reason, it has been of considerable interest to devise a method to eliminate such clones before selection.In this report, we describe a novel adaptation of the two-hybrid system designated the dual bait system. This system incorporates controls for false positive or nonspecific interactions in a single step and allows the simultaneous assay of a protein interaction with two related or unrelated partners in a single cell, which should also be useful for a variety of high throughput and genome-oriented studies. We demonstrated that these reagents are effective at selectively identifying two discrete sets of interacting proteins against an extensive background population of nonspecifically interacting proteins, supporting the idea of reagent appropriateness for large scale genomic applications.DISCUSSIONIn this report, we describe the development and characterization of novel dual bait reagents that can be used to study the interaction of a protein with two distinct partners in a single yeast cell. The cI repressor/cI operator system utilized in the SKY yeast strains and cIop-LacZ plasmids is demonstrated to function with a sensitivity range closely comparable with the pre-existing LexA repressor/lexA operator system in the interaction trap, facilitating their combined use. In a model system assaying the interaction of the related GTPases Ras and Krev-1 with their preferred partners Raf and Krit1 and their shared partner RalGDS, the dual bait system clearly differentiates higher affinityversus lower affinity interactions. In addition to effectiveness in discriminating interactions in grids of yeast streaked to selective plates, the discrimination observed is sufficiently robust to allow the isolation of yeast containing specifically interacting protein pairs against a vast excess of noninteracting pairs. These properties support the idea that these reagents will be useful in library screening and genome-scale applications. The reagents described here offer the option of performing two independent, simultaneous screens in a single yeast, with one set of positives registering through lexAop activation of LEU2 andlacZ and a second set through cIop activation ofLYS2 and gusA, both negatively controlled against each other. Together, these developments have the potential to greatly expand two-hybrid system contributions to studies of biological interactions.Several groups have recently described the use of two simultaneously expressed baits to identify mutations that selectively affect interactions of an activation domain-fused protein with one of two partners (38Inouye C. Dhillon N. Durfee T. Zambryski P.C. Thorner J. Genetics. 1997; 147: 479-492Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 39Jiang R. Carlson M. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 3105-3115Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 40Xu C.W. Mendelsohn A.R. Brent R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12473-12478Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In each case, introduction of a second bait-reporter system was obtained by eliminating one of the two reporters used for the primary bait, greatly reducing the screening power available to the system. However, in these novel reagents, both baits retain two distinct reporters, greatly facilitating the screening process. The value of having two separate reporters is evident even in the mixing experiment performed here (Fig. 6), as their use allowed the immediate discrimination of the noninteracting background clones from specific partners, which activated both reporters. The dual bait reagents described here can be similarly used for mutational analysis and have been recently used to successfully identify mutations in Pak1 kinase, which selectively reduce interaction affinity for either of two partners, the Cdc42 or Rac GTPases. 3M. Reeder, J. Chernoff, E. A. Golemis, and I. Serebriiskii, unpublished data. Finally, there is preliminary evidence that these reagents possess the power necessary to perform library screens in organisms with complex genomes; as in several recent library screens using the above reagents, cI- and the LexA-fused baits have yielded specific partners. 4M. J. Russell, personal communication; V. Khazak, unpublished data; Y. Z. Zhang and E. Golemis, unpublished data. On a more basic level, the system allows considerable savings in the effort required by individual investigators wishing to perform multiple two-hybrid screens without invoking the dual bait selectivity function. Instead of having to perform two separate library transformations or matings (generally the most laborious step in a screening process) and subsequent selection of positive clones, only one such step is required for any two baits. Furthermore, in the case where only one-half of a dual bait screen of a previously untested cDNA library is positive (e.g. if a LexA bait yields interactors but a cI bait does not), the fact that positive interactors are obtained for at least one bait will provide useful information toward the determination of whether the library utilized was of acceptable quality. Finally, it has previously been noted that some proteins of interest for cDNA library screening perform better with particular fusion domains (i.e. are productively utilized as LexA fusions but not as GAL4 fusions; or vice versa (23Estojak J. Brent R. Golemis E.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5820-5829Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar)). In cases where specific DNA binding domain/fusion domain problems are suspected, an investigator could express a bait of interest both as a LexA and as a cI fusion and screen with the bait in both configurations to maximize chances of obtaining valid positive interacting partners.The dual bait reagents are built upon the interaction trap form of two-hybrid system (4Gyuris J. Golemis E.A. Chertkov H. Brent R. Cell. 1993; 75: 791-803Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1319) Google Scholar). cI and LexA are similar in size (237versus 202 amino acids) and structure (41Sauer R.T. Yocum R.R. Doolittle R.F. Lewis M. Pabo C.O. Nature. 1982; 298: 447-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar) and use related amino-terminal helix-turn-helix domains to bind palindromic operator sites with similar K m values, ranging from 200 pm to 20 nm for LexA (discussed in Estojaket al. (23Estojak J. Brent R. Golemis E.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5820-5829Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar)) similar to cI (42Nelson H.C.M. Sauer R.T. Cell. 1985; 42: 549-558Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Because of these many similarities, it is clear that the LexA and cI systems are well matched. However, in addition to use in the current interaction trap shell, the cI “add-on” parts of this system have been constructed to potentially supplement any of the currently existing two-hybrid variants. Thus, the reporter system developed in this study purposely uses a DNA binding domain (cI), reporter genes (gusA andLYS2), and plasmid marker (zeocin resistance) not in use in any other two-hybrid-based system (2Chien C.T.

Cell. 1993; 74: 205-214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1656) Google Scholar), including the recently described membrane-based Sos recruitment system (16Aronheim A. Zandi E. Hennemann H. Elledge S.J. Karin M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3094-3102Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). Thus, these reagents could readily be integrated with any of the other screening systems operating on two-hybrid principles; in the case of the Sos recruitment system, this raises the possibility that with minor modifications of the library vector, a single bait could be simultaneously used to identify interactors using either a membrane-based or a transcriptional activation-based selection strategy, enlarging the potential pool of interacting proteins obtained. An additionally useful feature of the gusAreporter is that it is assayed using similar protocols even on the same plates as the lacZ reporter standardly used in two-hybrid systems, again contributing to ease of use. Finally, although the dual bait reagents here described have been optimized for use in conjunction with LexA fusions, parameters have been previously established to test and vary sensitivity levels (23Estojak J. Brent R. Golemis E.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5820-5829Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar), making merging of two-hybrid systems a relatively simple and certainly useful effort that should contribute to efforts to understand complex protein-protein interactions on the genome scale.

Finally, there has been interest in developing two-hybrid systems as tools in high throughput drug discovery screening strategies to identify agents regulating the activity of biologically important target proteins. As two-hybrid technologies have evolved to more complex applications, a question of mounting importance has been the degree to which library screens performed in these systems yield partners specific for the utilized bait, as opposed to proteins of broad interaction capability (“false positives”). Although the large number of published two-hybrid papers indicates that many specific partners are obtained, a recent survey has suggested that the majority of library screens isolate at least some cDNAs that are nonspecific. 2I. Serebriiskii and E. A. Golemis, E. A. (1996)http://www.fccc.edu/ research/labs/golemis/interactiontrapinwork.html. 2I. Serebriiskii and E. A. Golemis, E. A. (1996)http://www.fccc.edu/ research/labs/golemis/interactiontrapinwork.html. As a related issue, it is clear that many biologically important proteins are organized into families of evolutionarily related members that conserve substantial sequence similarity (e.g. Refs. 17Alt F.W. DePinho R. Zimmerman K. LeGouy E. Hatton K. Ferrier P. Tesfaye A. Yancopoulos G. Nisen P. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1986; 51: 931-941Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Meyerson M.

Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 215-217Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Thus, the degree to which two-hybrid systems isolate proteins partners absolutely specific for individual baits, rather than those that interact generally with a class of protein (“familial positives”), is also an issue. Although existing two-hybrid systems allow discrimination of uniquely specific interactors from false positives or familial positives through use of various methods of specificity testing performed subsequent to a screen (20Golemis E.A. Serebriiskii I. Gyuris J. Brent R. Ausubel F.M. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1997: 20.1.1-20.1.35Google Scholar), these methods are frequently laborious, particularly when many possible interactors must be tested. For this reason, it has been of considerable interest to devise a method to eliminate such clones before selection. In this report, we describe a novel adaptation of the two-hybrid system designated the dual bait system. This system incorporates controls for false positive or nonspecific interactions in a single step and allows the simultaneous assay of a protein interaction with two related or unrelated partners in a single cell, which should also be useful for a variety of high throughput and genome-oriented studies. We demonstrated that these reagents are effective at selectively identifying two discrete sets of interacting proteins against an extensive background population of nonspecifically interacting proteins, supporting the idea of reagent appropriateness for large scale genomic applications. DISCUSSIONIn this report, we describe the development and characterization of novel dual bait reagents that can be used to study the interaction of a protein with two distinct partners in a single yeast cell. The cI repressor/cI operator system utilized in the SKY yeast strains and cIop-LacZ plasmids is demonstrated to function with a sensitivity range closely comparable with the pre-existing LexA repressor/lexA operator system in the interaction trap, facilitating their combined use. In a model system assaying the interaction of the related GTPases Ras and Krev-1 with their preferred partners Raf and Krit1 and their shared partner RalGDS, the dual bait system clearly differentiates higher affinityversus lower affinity interactions. In addition to effectiveness in discriminating interactions in grids of yeast streaked to selective plates, the discrimination observed is sufficiently robust to allow the isolation of yeast containing specifically interacting protein pairs against a vast excess of noninteracting pairs. These properties support the idea that these reagents will be useful in library screening and genome-scale applications. The reagents described here offer the option of performing two independent, simultaneous screens in a single yeast, with one set of positives registering through lexAop activation of LEU2 andlacZ and a second set through cIop activation ofLYS2 and gusA, both negatively controlled against each other. Together, these developments have the potential to greatly expand two-hybrid system contributions to studies of biological interactions.Several groups have recently described the use of two simultaneously expressed baits to identify mutations that selectively affect interactions of an activation domain-fused protein with one of two partners (38Inouye C. Dhillon N. Durfee T. Zambryski P.C. Thorner J. Genetics. 1997; 147: 479-492Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 39Jiang R. Carlson M.

A. 1997; 94: 12473-12478Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In each case, introduction of a second bait-reporter system was obtained by eliminating one of the two reporters used for the primary bait, greatly reducing the screening power available to the system. However, in these novel reagents, both baits retain two distinct reporters, greatly facilitating the screening process. The value of having two separate reporters is evident even in the mixing experiment performed here (Fig. 6), as their use allowed the immediate discrimination of the noninteracting background clones from specific partners, which activated both reporters. The dual bait reagents described here can be similarly used for mutational analysis and have been recently used to successfully identify mutations in Pak1 kinase, which selectively reduce interaction affinity for either of two partners, the Cdc42 or Rac GTPases. 3M. Reeder, J. Chernoff, E. A. Golemis, and I. Serebriiskii, unpublished data. Finally, there is preliminary evidence that these reagents possess the power necessary to perform library screens in organisms with complex genomes; as in several recent library screens using the above reagents, cI- and the LexA-fused baits have yielded specific partners. 4M. J. Russell, personal communication; V. Khazak, unpublished data; Y. Z. Zhang and E. Golemis, unpublished data. On a more basic level, the system allows considerable savings in the effort required by individual investigators wishing to perform multiple two-hybrid screens without invoking the dual bait selectivity function. Instead of having to perform two separate library transformations or matings (generally the most laborious step in a screening process) and subsequent selection of positive clones, only one such step is required for any two baits. Furthermore, in the case where only one-half of a dual bait screen of a previously untested cDNA library is positive (e.g. if a LexA bait yields interactors but a cI bait does not), the fact that positive interactors are obtained for at least one bait will provide useful information toward the determination of whether the library utilized was of acceptable quality. Finally, it has previously been noted that some proteins of interest for cDNA library screening perform better with particular fusion domains (i.e. are productively utilized as LexA fusions but not as GAL4 fusions; or vice versa (23Estojak J. Brent R. Golemis E.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5820-5829Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar)). In cases where specific DNA binding domain/fusion domain problems are suspected, an investigator could express a bait of interest both as a LexA and as a cI fusion and screen with the bait in both configurations to maximize chances of obtaining valid positive interacting partners.The dual bait reagents are built upon the interaction trap form of two-hybrid system (4Gyuris J. Golemis E.A. Chertkov H. Brent R. Cell. 1993; 75: 791-803Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1319) Google Scholar). cI and LexA are similar in size (237versus 202 amino acids) and structure (41Sauer R.T. Yocum R.R. Doolittle R.F. Lewis M. Pabo C.O. Nature. 1982; 298: 447-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar) and use related amino-terminal helix-turn-helix domains to bind palindromic operator sites with similar K m values, ranging from 200 pm to 20 nm for LexA (discussed in Estojaket al. (23Estojak J. Brent R. Golemis E.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5820-5829Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar)) similar to cI (42Nelson H.C.M. Sauer R.T. Cell. 1985; 42: 549-558Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Because of these many similarities, it is clear that the LexA and cI systems are well matched. However, in addition to use in the current interaction trap shell, the cI “add-on” parts of this system have been constructed to potentially supplement any of the currently existing two-hybrid variants. Thus, the reporter system developed in this study purposely uses a DNA binding domain (cI), reporter genes (gusA andLYS2), and plasmid marker (zeocin resistance) not in use in any other two-hybrid-based system (2Chien C.T.

Elledge S.J. Karin M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3094-3102Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). Thus, these reagents could readily be integrated with any of the other screening systems operating on two-hybrid principles; in the case of the Sos recruitment system, this raises the possibility that with minor modifications of the library vector, a single bait could be simultaneously used to identify interactors using either a membrane-based or a transcriptional activation-based selection strategy, enlarging the potential pool of interacting proteins obtained. An additionally useful feature of the gusAreporter is that it is assayed using similar protocols even on the same plates as the lacZ reporter standardly used in two-hybrid systems, again contributing to ease of use. Finally, although the dual bait reagents here described have been optimized for use in conjunction with LexA fusions, parameters have been previously established to test and vary sensitivity levels (23Estojak J. Brent R. Golemis E.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5820-5829Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar), making merging of two-hybrid systems a relatively simple and certainly useful effort that should contribute to efforts to understand complex protein-protein interactions on the genome scale.

(1991) Genetics 129, 1007–1020) and human (Mu, D., Tursun, M., Duckett, D. R., Drummond, J. T., Modrich, P., and Sancar, A. (1997) Mol. Cell. Biol. 17, 760–769) long-patch mismatch-repair systems. Mismatch repair directed specifically against incorrect bases inserted during semi-conservative DNA replication might efficiently antagonize UV mutagenesis. To test this hypothesis, DNA 51-mers containing site-specific T-Tcis-syn-cyclobutane pyrimidine-dimers or T-T pyrimidine-(6-4′)pyrimidinone photoproducts, with all four possible bases opposite the respective 3′-thymines in the photoproducts, were analyzed for the ability to compete with radiolabeled (T/G)-mismatched DNA for binding by highly purified human MSH2·MSH6 heterodimer protein (hMutSα). Both (cyclobutane-dimer)/AG and ((6-4)photoproduct)/AG mismatches competed about as well as non-photoproduct T/T mismatches. The two respective pairs of photoproduct/(A(T or C)) mismatches also showed higher hMutSα affinity than photoproduct/AA “matches”; the apparent affinity of hMutSα for the ((6-4)photoproduct)/AA-“matched” substrate was actually less than that for TT/AA homoduplexes. Surprisingly, although hMutSα affinities for both non-photoproduct UU/GG double mismatches and for (uracil-cyclobutane-dimer)/AG single mismatches were high, affinity for the (uracil-cyclobutane-dimer)/GG mismatch was quite low. Equilibrium binding of hMutSα to DNA containing (photoproduct/base) mismatches and to (T/G)-mismatched DNA was reduced similarly by ATP (in the absence of magnesium).

In most prokaryotes, and in all eukaryotes examined, highly conserved protein systems that recognize DNA mismatches and certain DNA lesions play critical roles in maintenance of genetic stability. These long-patch mismatch-repair systems decrease DNA replication error rates 100−1000−fold, by recognizing and correcting mismatches that escape proofreading by DNA polymerases (1Kornberg A. Baker T.A. DNA Replication. W. H. Freeman & Co., New York1992: 497-498Google Scholar). In Escherichia coli(2Lahue R.S. Au K.G. Modrich P. Science. 1989; 245: 160-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar), homodimers of MutS protein bind preferentially to mismatches; MutS and MutL homodimers then activate MutH protein to nick specifically the unmethylated DNA strand at the nearest adenine-hemimethylated d(GATC) sequence, during the interval before adenines in newly replicated d(GATC) sequences are methylated. This most likely involves a translocation/search process that requires ATP hydrolysis (3Allen D.J. Makhov A. Grilley M. Taylor J. Thresher R. Modrich P. Griffith J.D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4467-4476Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). MutH thus specifically directs incision and subsequent excision to the nascent DNA strand, so replicative errors are always corrected rather than fixed. After excision via exonucleolytic cleavage from the initial incision past the mismatch, the replicative polymerase (here E. coli DNA polymerase III) fills the gap. The MutH/d(GATC)-hemimethylation strand-specificity mechanism is not found in eukaryotes or in some bacteria, and repair directionality remains poorly understood in these organisms. The MutS/MutL recognition/coupling paradigm is retained in eukaryotes but is now more complex (4Fishel R. Kolodner R.D. Curr. Opin. Genet. & Dev. 1995; 5: 382-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar, 5Modrich P. Lahue R.S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 101-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (1312) Google Scholar).

Recognition of nuclear-DNA mismatches is accomplished by two distinct heterodimers, comprised of MSH2 plus MSH6 or MSH2 plus MSH3 polypeptides; these show different but overlapping specificities for base/base mismatches and various insertion/deletion loop-outs (6Genschel J.

Accumulating evidence for interaction of mismatch-repair systems with a surprising variety of DNA lesions now points to additional roles for mismatch repair.

In particular, recombination of nonreplicating UV-irradiated phage λ DNA in (unirradiated) E. coli mutants deficient in excision repair (UvrA−) was found to depend mostly on E. coli MutS, MutL, and MutH functions, on the presence of unmethylated d(GATC) sequences in the phage DNA (16Feng W.-Y. Lee E. Hays J.B. Genetics. 1991; 129: 1007-1020Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and on helicase and exonuclease functions previously implicated in mismatch repair (17Feng W.-Y. Hays J.B. Genetics. 1995; 140: 1175-1186Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Analysis of intracellular DNA revealed extensive MutS-dependent breakdown of the nonreplicating UV-irradiated DNA (17Feng W.-Y. Hays J.B. Genetics. 1995; 140: 1175-1186Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Studies of transcription-coupled nucleotide excision repair of cyclobutane-pyrimidine-dimers (CPDs) in E. coli and in human cells have, respectively, implicated MutS and MutL (23Mellon I. Champe G.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 93: 1292-1297Crossref Scopus (149) Google Scholar) and MSH2 and MLH1 (24Mellon I. Raipal D.K. Koi M. Boland C.R. Champe G.N. Science. 1996; 272: 557-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar) functions in these processes. A recent study by Mu et al. (25Mu D. Tursun M. Duckett D.R. Drummond J.T. Modrich P. Sancar A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 760-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar) has provided direct evidence for binding of human MSH2·MSH6 heterodimers (conveniently abbreviated hMutSα (26Drummond J. Li G.-M. Longley M.J. Modrich P. Science. 1995; 268: 1909-1912Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar)) to DNA-containing UV photoproducts (or cisplatin lesions). Binding to DNA-containing CPD/base mismatches (T<>T/AG) was roughly 1/3 as high as binding to non-photoproduct base/base mismatches (TT/AG). The marginal binding to matched CPDs (T<>T/AA) and (6-4)photoproducts (T(6-4)T/AA) could not be clearly distinguished from the nonspecific background. No data for (T(6-4)T/AG) substrates were reported. In parallel experiments, T<>T/AG moieties proved to be markedly better substrates for nucleotide excision repair than T<>T/AA. We suggest that where error-prone DNA synthesis past UV photoproducts produces photoproduct/base mismatches, mismatch repair directed against error-rich nascent DNA by the usual strand-specificity signals might remove most of these potential mutations, before fixation by nucleotide excision repair or further semi-conservative replication. A logical corollary is that mismatch repair should be highly specific for photoproduct/base mismatches, because repeated initiation of repair at matched photoproduct/base pairs might engender futile cycles that wasted cellular energy and/or led to cell death (19Duckett D.R. Drummond J.T. Murchie A.I.H. Reardon J. Sancar A. Lilley D.M.J. Modrich P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6443-6447Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar, 27D'atri S. Tentori L.

Here we have analyzed interactions of highly active purified hMutSα protein with both T<>T and T(6-4)T substrates. We tested all four bases opposite the 3′-thymine in these photoproducts, the site of most reported UV-induced mutations (Refs. 28Lawrence C.W. Banerjee S.K. Borden A. LeClerc J.E. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1990; 222: 166-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 29LeClerc J.E. Borden A. Lawrence C.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1995: 545-555Google Scholar). We also tested a series of U<>U substrates for binding by hMutSα, because mismatch repair of Py<>U/PuG moieties arising by rapid deamination of cytosines in CPDs (32Peng W. Shaw B.R. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 10172-10181Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) might actually fix mutations, perhaps contributing to the surprising preponderance of C to T over T to C transitions in UV-induced mutation spectra (31Friedberg E.C. Walker G.C. Seide W. DNA Repair and Mutagenesis. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1995: 545-555Google Scholar). Sensitivity was high in these measurements, because of the absence of carrier DNA and the low nonspecific background. To maximize resolution, we tested the ability of the various photoproduct pairs to compete with a radiolabeled T/G substrate, rather than directly measuring binding by hMutSα. We show here that hMutSα binds with high specificity to both T<>T and T(6-4)T photoproduct/base mismatches; binding to T(6-4)T/AA moieties actually appears less strong than to TT/AA homoduplexes. Although hMutSα recognizes all photoproduct/base mispairs, the highest affinity is for guanine opposite the 3′-thymine in either photoproduct. Affinity for single mismatches opposite U<>U photoproducts is at least as high as for mismatched T<>T photoproducts. HeLaS3 cells were either purchased from the National Cell Culture Center (Minneapolis, MN) or grown in Joklik modified medium (Life Technologies Inc.) supplemented with 5% calf serum, at the Cell Culture Facility, Oregon State University Environmental Health Science Center. Nuclear extracts were prepared from HeLaS3 cells as described (26Drummond J. Li G.-M. Longley M.J. Modrich P. Science. 1995; 268: 1909-1912Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar). In brief, proteins were extracted with 0.15 m salt from nuclei released from the cells broken by homogenization and then precipitated with ammonium sulfate. hMutSα protein heterodimers were prepared essentially as described (21Li G.-M. Wang H. Romano L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24084-24088Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 26Drummond J. Li G.-M. Longley M.J. Modrich P. Science. 1995; 268: 1909-1912Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar). Briefly, the 30–65% ammonium sulfate fraction from HeLaS3 nuclear extracts was passed through a single-stranded DNA-cellulose column, and the fraction subsequently eluted with 1 mm ATP, then chromatographed on a 1-ml Amersham Pharmacia Biotech HR 5/5 Mono Q column. Purified hMutSα was supplemented with 1.0 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (BSA) and 10% (w/v) sucrose, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Coomassie Blue staining indicated that the purified protein was near homogeneity (>98% pure). This procedure yielded 30–40 μg of protein from 10 to 15 liters of cells, as determined by the Bradford assay using BSA standards (33Bradford M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211983) Google Scholar). All oligonucleotide sequences used here were designed to be free from significant secondary structure, using CPrimer program (free software from Regents of University of California). DNA 11-mers containing no photoproducts (Table I, oligomers 1 and 4) or single site-specific T<>T, T(6-4)T, or U<>U photoproducts (oligomers 2, 3, and 5) were prepared and purified by high pressure liquid chromatography as described (28Lawrence C.W. Banerjee S.K. Borden A. LeClerc J.E. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1990; 222: 166-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 29LeClerc J.E. Borden A. Lawrence C.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 1837-1840Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The U<>U oligomers were then 5′-phosphorylated using phage-T4 polynucleotide kinase and unlabeled ATP. (The T<>T and T(6-4)T oligomers were purified in phosphorylated form.) Chromatographic analyses indicated that T<>T, T(6-4)T, and U<>U oligomers were >99.5, >99, and >95% pure, respectively. The “top right” flanking 20-mer 7 was purchased from Life Technologies, Inc., phosphorylated, and high pressure liquid chromatography-purified. The “top left” flanking 20-mer 6 and the bottom “scaffold” 41-mer 8 were synthesized at the Oregon State University Central Services Facility, purified by electrophoresis in 20 or 10% denaturing gels (polyacrylamide gels containing 7 m urea), and recovered from gel by standard procedures (34Ellington A. Pollard J.D. Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocol in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1994: 2.12.1-2.12.7Google Scholar). To prepare top strand 51-mers (oligomers 9–13), we used about 2.5 nmol each of oligomers 1–5, respectively. The latter were mixed with oligomers 6–8 (1.5−, 1.5−, and 2−fold excess, respectively) in DNA Ligase Buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5; 10 mm MgCl2; 10 mm dithiothreitol; 1 mm ATP; 25 μg/ml BSA) and heated at 85 °C for 5 min; after slow cooling to 16 °C, mixtures were incubated overnight with 15 units of DNA ligase (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA). The product 51-mer top strands were separated from shorter oligomers by electrophoresis in 10% denaturing gels and recovered as described above.Table IOligonucleotides used in this study (5′–3′)1.

Bottom strand 51-mers (oligomers 14–18) were synthesized and purified as described above for oligomer 8. These were mixed with various photoproduct-containing and non-photoproduct top 51-mers in Annealing Buffer (10 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0; 1 mm Na2EDTA; 100 mm NaCl), heated at 85 °C for 5 min, and slowly cooled to room temperature. After addition of 0.2 volume of BND-cellulose (equivalent to 0.1 volume of settled resin), 5 m NaCl was added to a final concentration of 1 m. Mixtures were incubated 5 min and then layered onto Sephadex G-50 Nick Spin Columns (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden) that had previously been equilibrated in DNA Buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0; 1 mm Na2EDTA). Duplexes were recovered after centrifugation, according to the instructions of the manufacturer. To test for removal of single-stranded DNA, a small aliquot was treated with polynucleotide kinase (which prefers 5′-single-stranded DNA ends (35Richardson C.C. Enzymes. 1981; 14: 299-314Crossref Scopus (55) Google Scholar)) and [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol, NEN Life Science Products) and electrophoresed in non-denaturing 10% polyacrylamide gels. If necessary, the BND-cellulose and spin-column steps were repeated. No single-stranded DNA contaminants were apparent in the final autoradiographs. Conductivity of spin-column pass-through solutions were found to be the same as for DNA buffer, i.e.essentially all NaCl had been removed. Final DNA concentrations (typically 0.25–0.5 μm) were determined by the Hoechst-33258 dye-binding fluorometric technique of Labarca and Paigen (36Labarca C. Paigen P. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 102: 344-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (4537) Google Scholar), using a series of DNA standards and a TKO 100 Fluorometer (Hoefer Scientific Instruments) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. We prepared 32P-end-labeled non-photoproduct T/G heteroduplexes similarly, except that the top 51-mer 9 was32P-5′-end-labeled before mixing with bottom 51-mer 16. Reaction mixtures (25 μl) contained 1.32 nm32P-5′-end-labeled TT/AG (oligomers 9/16) duplex 51-mers in Binding Buffer (10 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.5; 110 mmKCl; 1 mm dithiothreitol; 0.4% glycerol), plus particular competing 51-mer duplexes at various concentrations, and hMutSα protein at 3 nm. After incubation for 20 min on ice, mixtures were supplemented with 5 μl of 50% sucrose (w/v) in Binding Buffer, immediately loaded onto 6% polyacrylamide gels (36:1 acrylamide:bisacrylamide (w/w); 6.7 mm Tris acetate, pH 7.5; 1 mm Na2EDTA), and electrophoresed at 8 V/cm for 240 min, with recirculation of room temperature buffer. Gels were dried onto Whatman 3MM paper and visualized by autoradiography at room temperature, using Kodak Biomax x-ray film with intensifying screens. To determine relative amounts of bound (mobility-shifted) and free [32P]DNA, we measured band intensities using a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager. We define fractional bindingFB(c) = (intensity of shifted [32P]DNA band)/(total intensity of all [32P]DNA bands), in the presence of competitor DNA at concentration c, and we define c 50 byFB(c 50)/FB(0) = 0.5. We determined c 50 values for the various competitors from straight lines fitted to (FB(c))−1 versus c plots; correlation factors for the fits were >0.97. Titrations with hMutSα of32P-labeled TT/AG 51-mer (prepared as described above), on ice and at 37 °C, were performed as described under “Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Competition Assay,” except that protein concentrations were varied from 0.2 to 5 nm and no additional competitor DNA was present. For testing effects of ATP on direct equilibrium binding of hMutSα to TT/AG, T<>T/AG, and T(6-4)T/AG 51-mers, respective unlabeled competitor duplexes were end-labeled using overnight incubation with polynucleotide kinase plus [γ-32P]ATP, and higher ATP:DNA ratios than employed with single-stranded DNA, then purified using Sephadex G-50 spin columns. Mixtures containing 1.32 nm 51-mers, 3 nm hMutSα, and various concentrations of ATP were incubated 20 min on ice, and then analyzed as described under “Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Competition Assays,” except that no competitor DNA was present. Because we expected that hMutSα might bind relatively weakly to some photoproduct base pairs, we sought to maximize the sensitivity of binding assays. Use of purified hMutSα of high specific activity minimized both spurious bands due to binding by protein fragments and nonspecific binding by partially inactive protein, making unnecessary the excess carrier DNA employed in some previous studies. Free single-stranded DNA, for which hMutSα shows significant affinity, 2H. Wang and J. Hays, unpublished observations. was completely removed by BND-cellulose chromatography, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” These precautions made it possible to accurately determine absolute concentrations of both bound and unbound DNA. We initially tested the hMutSα preparation by using it to titrate radiolabeled DNA 51-mers incorporating a T/G mismatch, typically the base mispair recognized best by MutS-like proteins (26Drummond J.

Chem. 1992; 267: 23876-23882Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), employing electrophoretic mobility shift assays (Fig.1 A). Previous workers have performed such assays at various temperatures. Here titrations at 4 and 37 °C yielded nearly identical binding curves (Fig. 1 B). Saturation was at 88 and 93% DNA binding, respectively, and apparent half-saturation was at 1.3 nm hMutSα. Only negligible levels of complexes moving faster than the major band were apparent (Fig. 1 A). To eliminate the possibility that the major band corresponded to highly cooperative binding of two hMutSα heterodimers, which would result in a sigmoidal binding curve, we measured binding at numerous low protein concentrations. The data (Fig.1 B) correspond to a strictly hyperbolic (non-cooperative) curve. Calculation of dissociation constants (K dvalues) from concentrations of bound and unbound DNA at hMutSα concentrations below 2 nm yielded 1.2 nm. A similar titration experiment (data not shown) yielded a half-saturation concentration of 1.3 nm. The apparent K dof 1.2 nm for this hMutSα preparation is at the extreme lower range of values reported for previous binding studies. Previous studies showed apparent saturation at various hMutSα:DNA ratios as follows: 2–4 for hMutSα purified from HeLa cells in the presence (26Drummond J. Li G.-M. Longley M.J. Modrich P.

Cell. 1997; 91: 995-1005Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar) for recombinant proteins. The high concentrations of nonspecific carrier DNA employed in some of these cases might have affected apparent hMutSα binding properties. At hMutSα concentrations above 2 nm, increasing levels of a slower moving complex appeared, corresponding to about 8% of bound DNA at the highest protein concentrations. This might reflect nonspecific binding of a second hMutSα molecule to regions of the 51-bp substrate outside of the 25–35-bp region expected to be covered by a single heterodimer bound to the central mismatch (15Gradia S. Acharya S. Fishel R. Cell. 1997; 91: 995-1005Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). The titration curve does not extend far enough to determine unequivocally whether binding of this additional protein is cooperative, i.e. facilitated by the presence of the mismatch-bound hMutSα, or essentially independent. The apparent absence of such multi-protein complexes in previous studies may have been due to the smaller size of the heteroduplex substrates employed and/or the pre"

The ubiquitin pathway is crucial in cellular regulation (1Jentsch S. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1992; 26: 179-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar, 2Haas A.L. Siepmann T.J.

It is now clear that this pathway regulates the life span of many important proteins, including some cyclins, cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors, histones, oncoproteins, and tumor suppressors. Therefore, this pathway regulates many cellular processes, including cell cycle progression and apoptosis, transcription regulation, and antigen presentation (4Hochstrasser M. Curr. Opin.

Ubiquitin is a protein with 76 amino acids. Its C-terminal Gly residue is involved in covalent conjugation to a Lys residue of other proteins. The C-terminal Gly residue of one ubiquitin molecule can also conjugate to Lys48 of another ubiquitin molecule in multi-ubiquitination. In the ubiquitination pathway, the ubiquitin activation enzyme E1 1The abbreviations used are: E1, ubiquitin activation enzyme; E2, ubiquitin conjugation enzyme (UBC); E3, ubiquitin-protein ligase; hUBC, human UBC; HSQC, heteronuclear single quantum correlation spectroscopy activates ubiquitin by hydrolyzing ATP to form a high energy bond with ubiquitin. Ubiquitin is then transferred to a ubiquitin conjugation enzyme (UBC) also known as E2. In this step, the C-terminal Gly is conjugated to the SH group of the active-site Cys residue of E2. Then E2 interacts with substrate proteins to transfer ubiquitin to the substrate proteins. In some cases, this process requires the participation of ubiquitin-protein ligase (E3). Proteins with high sequence homology to ubiquitin and to the E1 and E2 enzymes have been found. Human UBC9, composed of 158 amino acid residues, is a member of the E2 protein family. Among the conserved residues in the E2 family of proteins, the fragment containing the ubiquitin-accepting Cys residue is highly conserved. UBC9 conjugates with a ubiquitin homologue, UBL1, instead of ubiquitin. The interaction between UBC9 and UBL1 is specific, because UBC9 does not interact well with ubiquitin, and UBL1 does not interact with UBC2 in a yeast two-hybrid system (7Shen Z.

Shen B. Chen D.J. Chen Y. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 1415-1425Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The E2 proteins have highly conserved tertiary structures with root mean square deviation of Cα atoms less than 2 Å, excluding two surface loops. The two surface loops occur around amino acid residues 30 and 100 and vary significantly in the lengths of the sequences and three-dimensional structures among different UBC proteins. Several regions on UBC9 have higher conformational flexibility than average. The N-terminal site has the highest mobility over a wide range of time scales. A region between the C terminus and the active site also displays higher mobility on the ps∼ns and ms time scales. The ubiquitin homologue UBL1 is also known as SUMO-1, GMP1, SMTP3, PIC1, or sentrin (for a review, see Ref. 21Saitoh H. Pu R.T. Dasso M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 374-376Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). It contains 101 amino acid residues. Residues 22–97 of UBL1 share approximately 48% sequence homology with ubiquitin. Residues 98–101 of UBL1 are cleaved before conjugation with E1. A unique feature of ubiquitin and ubiquitin-like proteins is that they all contain a diglycine sequence at the C terminus that is capable of conjugating to other proteins. An E1 homologue specific for the yeast UBL1 and UBC9 has also been found (22Johnson E.S. Schwienhorst I. Dohmen R.J. Blobel G. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5509-5519Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). The three-dimensional structures of ubiquitin and UBL1 have been determined (23Vijay-Kumar S. Bugg C.E. Cook W.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 194: 531-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (1375) Google Scholar, 24Bayer P. Arndt A. Metzger S. Mahajan R. Melchior F. Jaenicke R. Becker J. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 280: 275-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). In addition, information on their conformational flexibilities has been obtained from NMR studies (25Schneider D.M. Dellwo M.J. Wand A.J. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 3645-3652Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 24Bayer P. Arndt A. Metzger S. Mahajan R. Melchior F. Jaenicke R. Becker J. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 280: 275-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). As expected from sequence conservation, residues 22–97 of UBL1 have a similar three-dimensional structure as ubiquitin. In addition, the C-terminal residues of UBL1 are as flexible in solution as those of ubiquitin. The 21 extra amino acid residues at the N terminus of UBL1 have mainly a random conformation. This segment contains mostly hydrophilic amino acid residues and is overall negatively charged. There are only three hydrophobic residues, one Met, Ala, and Leu in this segment. Despite the intensive studies on ubiquitination, the mechanism of protein-protein interactions in ubiquitination is not well understood. Details of the interaction and conjugation between an E2 and a ubiquitin are still not clear. One of the major difficulties in investigating these interactions is that they are not strong and cannot be easily detected by conventional biochemical approaches. NMR methods have contributed greatly to the characterization of molecular interactions. Chemical shift perturbation is one of the most sensitive methods to monitor specific protein complex formation (26Chen Y. Reizer J. Saier Jr., M.H. Fairbrother W.J. Wright P.E. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 32-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Chemical shift changes are capable of mapping the binding interfaces of protein complexes with dissociation constants in the mm to nm ranges. This paper describes the identification of the binding interfaces between UBC9 and UBL1 using NMR chemical shift perturbation. Because the binding site of UBL1 resides on the ubiquitin domain and the binding site of UBC9 resides on a structurally conserved region of E2, the observed interaction may represent a general feature of E2-ubiquitin interactions. Both human UBC9 and UBL1 were subcloned into vector PET28 (from Novagen, Inc.). The modified plasmids have an open reading frame that encodes the His6 tag at the N terminus followed by the sequence of UBC9 or UBL1. Escherichia colicontaining the expression plasmid were grown at 37 °C in M-9 minimal media supplemented with trace minerals and basal medium Eagle vitamins (Life Technologies, Inc.). (15NH4)2SO4 (1.5 g/liter) was used as the nitrogen source. Both proteins were purified using nickel nitrilotriacetic acid columns. Approximately 20∼30 mg of UBC9 and 10 mg of UBL1 were purified from 1 liter of the M-9 culture. Both samples were of high purity, because no impurities were observed on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. All NMR samples contained 100 mm phosphate buffer (pH 6.0) in 90% H2O, 10% D2O. The concentrations of protein samples were estimated with the Bio-Rad protein assay. 1H-15N HSQC experiments (27Kay L.E. Keifer P. Saarinen T. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1992; 114: 10663-10665Crossref Scopus (2433) Google Scholar) were performed on a Varian Unity plus 500 spectrometer equipped with four channels, pulse shaping, and pulsed field gradient capabilities. The digital resolutions of the spectra were 0.02 ppm in the proton dimension and 0.05 ppm in the amide 15N dimension. For observing the UBL1 bind site on UBC9, 0.3 mm15N-labeled UBC9 was used. Unlabeled UBL1 was titrated into the sample containing UBC9. The final concentrations of both proteins at the end of the titration were approximately 0.2 mm. The spectra were acquired at 30 °C, a condition used for obtaining the resonance assignments of UBC9. For detecting the UBC9 binding site on UBL1, 0.5 mm15N-labeled UBL1 was used and titrated with unlabeled UBC9. The final concentrations of both proteins at the end of the titration were approximately 0.3 mm. The HSQC spectra for obtaining the binding interface on UBL1 were performed at 17 °C, which was used for the resonance assignments of UBL1. The NMR resonance assignments for UBC9 have been described previously (28Liu Q. Shen B. Chen D.J. Chen Y. J. Biomol. NMR. 1999; 13: 89-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The NMR resonance assignments for UBL1 will be described elsewhere. 2C. Jin, Z. Shen, X. Liao, manuscript in preparation. We calculated the surface electrostatic potentials for UBL1, ubiquitin, UBC9, UBC4, and UBC7 (8Tong H. Hateboer G. Perrakis A. Bernards R. Sixma T.K. J. Biol.

The solvent dielectric constant was set to 80. The radius of the probe water molecule was 1.4 Å. The grids in the calculation of the electrostatic potentials were with a spacing of 1.5 Å. We have used 15N-1H HSQC spectra to map the binding interfaces of the ubiquitin homologue UBL1 and human UBC9.15N-1H HSQC has been frequently used to map the binding surfaces of protein-protein, protein-nucleic acid, and protein-ligand interactions. In this spectrum, resonances are usually well resolved because of large 15N chemical shift dispersion. Because each amino acid residue gives one peak in this spectrum, it is easy to monitor the chemical shift perturbation of each amino acid. The binding interface on UBC9 was obtained using15N-labeled UBC9 in complex with unlabeled UBL1.15N-1H HSQC spectra of UBC9, free and in complex with UBL1, were compared. Similarly, the binding interface on UBL1 was mapped using 15N-labeled UBL1 and unlabeled UBC9.15N-1H HSQC spectra of UBL1, free and in complex with UBC9, were compared. Specific chemical shift perturbation and changes in the line widths were observed in the1H-15N HSQC spectrum of UBC9 upon forming complex with UBL1. These changes were observed from the beginning of the titration, when the concentration of UBC9 was approximately 0.3 mm and that of UBL1 was 0.03 mm until the final concentrations of UBL1 and UBC9 reached approximately 0.2 mm. Superposition of the HSQC spectra of free UBC9 and that in complex with UBL1 is shown in Fig. 1. The assignments of the resonances in the complex that undergo fast exchange were made by following resonance shifts during titration. Details of the chemical shift changes of UBC9 at the end of the titration are given in Table I. Variations in line widths between the resonances of free UBC9 and UBC9 at the end of the titration are indicated by relative changes in peak heights, also given in Table I. Most peaks of UBC9 were not affected, indicating that complex formation between the two proteins does not cause large conformational changes in UBC9. Some residues were significantly affected by the complex formation. The line widths of residues Ala10, Ala15, Arg17, Lys18, Phe22, Gly23, and Phe24 became so broad in the complex that their cross-peaks cannot be observed from the beginning of the titration when the ratio of UBC9:UBL1 was 10. These residues are colored in dark bluein the ribbon diagram of the UBC9 structure (Fig.2 A). Residues Ser7, Lys14, Trp16, Glu19, His20, Ala26, Val27, Met36, Gln37, Lys59, Leu63, and Ser158 moved more than 0.2 ppm in the 15N dimension or more than 0.18 ppm in the 1H dimension at the end of the titration. These residues are colored in cyan in Fig. 2 A. In addition, residues Ile4, Thr29, and Gly115 moved more than 0.14 ppm in the 15N dimension at the end of the titration. The proton resonances of these residues did not change more than 0.04 ppm. These residues are shown in green in Fig. 2 A. The chemical shift changes of these residues are linear with the addition of UBC1. Some residues had larger increases in line widths than average but had small chemical shift changes. These residues are labeled in the spectra in Fig. 1. Some of these residues are close to the region that showed the largest perturbation upon the formation of the complex, and some are located on the main β-sheet. Most of the chemical shift changes on UBC9 occur in the nitrogen dimension. Residues that are most affected by the complex formation are clustered together in the three-dimensional structure, suggesting that this region is the binding interface. A few residues on these surfaces, including Leu9, Asn11, Glu12, Arg13, Lys30, and Gln31, have resonances that overlap with other resonances and, therefore, could not be monitored for their chemical shift perturbations. These residues are colored in gray in Fig. 2 A. Thus, the region of UBC9 interacting the UBL1, as suggested by the chemical shift perturbations, consists of the first α-helix, the first β-strand, the loop between them, and the second β-strand.Table I1HN, 15NH chemical shift changes, Δδ (ppm), and peak height ratios of hUBC9 in a mixture with UBL1 relative to that of free proteinView Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)The chemical shift changes are given as the differences between of the free hUBC9 resonances and the resonances in the complex.

Unlabeled UBC9 was used to titrate15N-labeled UBL1. The concentrations of UBL1 and hUBC9 at the end of the titration are about 0.45 and 0.39 mm, respectively. The superposition of the HSQC spectra of UBL1, free and in complex with UBC9, is shown in Fig. 3.

Details of the chemical shift changes of UBL1 at the end of the titration are given in Table II. Variations in line widths between the resonances of free UBL1 and UBL1 at the end of the titration are indicated by relative changes in peak heights, given in Table II. The resonances of residues Ile27, Ser31, Leu65, Glu67, Asp86, Ile88, and Val90 were significantly broadened, because their peaks disappeared in the HSQC spectrum. These residues are shown indark blue in the ribbon diagram of the structure of UBL1 (Fig. 4 A). Residues Val26, Phe64, Gly68, Ile71, Gly81, Met82, Glu83, Glu85, and Val87 showed chemical shift changes of more than 0.25 ppm in the 15N dimension and/or more than approximately 0.1 ppm in the 1H dimension. Many of these residues have large chemical shift changes in both the proton and nitrogen dimensions. The chemical shift changes of these residues are linear with the addition of UBC9. These residues are colored in cyan in Fig. 4 A. These residues are also clustered together in the three-dimensional structure of UBL1, suggesting that this region is the binding interface with UBC9. This surface is located on the main β-sheet in the ubiquitin domain of UBL1. No chemical shift changes were observed for the N-terminal 21-amino acid residues, indicating that this region is not involved in interaction with UBC9.Table II1HN, 15NH chemical shift changes, Δδ (ppm), and peak height ratios of UBL1 in a mixture with hUBC9 relative to that of the free proteinView Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)The chemical shift changes are given as the difference between of the free UBL1 resonances and the UBL1 resonances in the complex.

Only the residues of UBL1 that give unoverlap peaks in two-dimensional 15N-edited HSQC are shown in the table. Chemical shift perturbation is extremely effective in mapping the binding surfaces. The chemical shift of a nuclei is sensitive to the changes of its local environment including aromatic ring current effects, peptide bond anisotropy, electrostatic interactions, and hydrogen bonding. When two proteins form a complex, the interactions between them cause changes in the environment of the amino acids at the interfaces, resulting in chemical shift changes. Any small additional conformation changes near the direct contacting surfaces will cause additional chemical shift perturbation. Thus the surface mapped by chemical shift perturbation contains but extends beyond the direct binding surface. However, residues that have the largest chemical shift changes are usually located within the binding interface. The amino acid residues involved in the recognition between UBC9 and the ubiquitin homologue UBL1 are highly conserved throughout different species. Residues 10–27 of UBC9 had the largest changes in resonance line widths and chemical shifts upon complex formation with UBL1. Twelve of these 17 residues are identical among UBC9 of human, Saccharomyces cerevisiae andSchizosaccharomyces pombe (30Loveys D.A. Streiff M.B. Schaefer T.S. Kato G.J. Gene. 1997; 201: 169-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Two more residues have conservative mutations from Arg to Lys and Val to Tyr. Among the residues that are affected by complexation, four positively charged residues are conserved between the yeast and human proteins, including Arg13, Lys14, Arg17, and Lys18. In addition, two negatively charged residue, Glu12 and Asp19, are identical between the yeast and human proteins. Six hydrophobic residues in this region are highly conserved including Trp16, Pro21, Phe22, Phe23, Val24, and Ala25. Five of them are identical between the human and yeast proteins. Residues 26, 64–71, and 81–91 of UBL1 had the most significant changes in line widths and chemical shifts upon complex formation with UBC9. Nine of these residues are identical between the human and yeast proteins (24Bayer P. Arndt A. Metzger S. Mahajan R. Melchior F. Jaenicke R. Becker J. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 280: 275-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). Four residues are highly conserved, including a Phe to Tyr mutation, two Glu to Asp mutations, and a Val to Ile mutation. Among the residues that are affected by complexation, four negatively charged residues are highly conserved including Glu83,Glu84, Asp86, and Glu89. In addition, a positively charged residue, Arg70, is identical between the yeast and human proteins. Lys25 on this surface is identical among UBL1s of different species. However, this residue has overlapping resonances in the 1H-15N HSQC, and it is not clear whether it had significant chemical shift changes. Six hydrophobic residues are conserved, including Leu65, Phe66, Met82, Val87, Ile88, and Val90. Most of these residues are identical between the yeast and human proteins, except Phe66 mutated to a Tyr and Val87 to a Ile in the S. cerevisiae protein. Sequence conservation indicates important functions for these residues. For UBC9 and UBL1, similar numbers of hydrophobic residues are conserved at the binding interfaces. In addition, similar numbers of the opposite-charged residues at the binding interfaces are also conserved. This suggests the compatibility of the binding interfaces. The binding interfaces of the UBC9-UBL1 complex are highly complementary in their electrostatic potentials and hydrophobicity. The surface electrostatic potentials of UBC9 and UBL1 are displayed in Fig. 2 B and4 B, respectively. Surface hydrophobic side chains in the binding interfaces are displayed in yellow along with electrostatic potentials in Fig. 5. For UBC9, the surface of residues 10–30 and 35–37 are displayed in Fig.5 A. For UBL1, the surfaces of residues 25–27, 31, 65–71, and 81–90 are displayed in Fig. 5 B. The sizes of the surface areas that showed significant changes in line widths and chemical shifts are similar and are approximately 1,500 Å2. The surface of UBC9, which is involved in binding to UBL1, is mainly positively charged (Fig. 2 B and5 A). The surface of UBL1, which is involved in binding to UBC9, is mainly negatively charged (24Bayer P. Arndt A. Metzger S. Mahajan R. Melchior F. Jaenicke R. Becker J. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 280: 275-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar) (Fig. 4 B and5 B). The opposite surface of UBL1 from the binding interface has an overall positive potential (24Bayer P. Arndt A. Metzger S. Mahajan R. Melchior F. Jaenicke R. Becker J. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 280: 275-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). The N-terminal 21-amino acid residues of UBL1 are mainly negatively charged and may contribute to the electrostatic energy when forming a complex with the positively charged surface of UBC9. However, no specific chemical shift changes have been observed for residues 1–16. Residue 17 showed some15N chemical shift perturbation (0.19 ppm). Because this change is smaller compared with that in the ubiquitin domain, and this residue is close to the region that displays large changes in chemical shifts and line widths, this perturbation may not result from direct contacts. Electrostatic interactions can be long range and nonspecific and, therefore, may not result in specific chemical shift changes. A detailed mechanism for UBL1 and UBC9 recognition is proposed. The conserved charged residues of UBC9, Arg13, Lys14, Arg17, and Lys18, are clustered together at the lower right corner of Fig. 5 A. The conservative residues of UBL1, Glu83, Glu84, Glu85, and Asp86, are clustered at the lower left corner in Fig. 5 B. Both regions are adjacent to the surface hydrophobic side chains. These two regions may interact with each other in the complex. Conserved residues Glu12 of UBC9 and Lys25 of UBL1, located at the inner sides of Fig. 5, may form a salt bridge. Surface hydrophobic side chains are located near the outer upper sides on the binding surfaces shown in Fig. 5. These residues are in complementary positions and can readily form hydrophobic interactions. These hydrophobic interactions may contribute significantly to the specificity of the complex, because hydrophobic interactions are of short range. The outer lower regions, which have positive and negative potentials shown in Figs. 5, A andB, respectively, are composed of several polar residues that may form intermolecular hydrogen bonds. Because the highly conserved residues on the binding interfaces are charged and hydrophobic residues, the mechanism of recognition is likely through mainly hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions. Our results explain the specificity of UBC9 and UBL1 interactions. It was reported previously that UBC9 conjugated with UBL1 but not ubiquitin (9Desterro J.M.P. Thomson J. Hay R.T. FEBS Lett. 1997; 417: 297-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). Although the sequences and three-dimensional structures are highly conserved between UBL1 and ubiquitin, the surface electrostatic potentials between the two proteins are very different. The surface of UBL1 that binds UBC9 has an overall negative electrostatic potential. However, this surface of ubiquitin is positively charged (24Bayer P. Arndt A. Metzger S. Mahajan R. Melchior F. Jaenicke R. Becker J. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 280: 275-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). Electrostatic repulsion will prevent UBC9 from interacting with ubiquitin well. Titration of unlabeled ubiquitin to15N-labeled UBC9 until the concentration ratio of ubiquitin to UBC9 reached 6∼7 did not show any specific chemical shift changes (data not shown), indicating that the two proteins do not show specific binding. The surface electrostatic potentials were also calculated for UBC4 and UBC7 (17Cook W.J. Jeffrey L.C. Xu Y. Chau V. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 13809-13817Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 18Cook W.J. Martin P.D. Edwards B.F.P. Yamazaki R.K. Chau V. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1621-1627Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), which interact with ubiquitin. The regions that superimpose with the UBL1 binding site of UBC9 on the two E2 proteins have negative or neutral potentials, which is compatible with the electrostatic potential of the ubiquitin surface that superimposes with the UBC9 binding site on UBL1. UBL1 and the E1 homolog for this system may bind to different locations on UBC9. It is likely that UBL1 contributes significantly to the affinity with UBC9 in the E1-UBL1 conjugate. It has been shown that deletion of the N terminus of UBL1 affected its interaction with UBC9 (31Gong L. Kamitani T. Fujise K. Caskey L.S. Yeh E.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28198-28201Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). This seems unrelated to E1, because the conjugation of UBL1 to E1 and other proteins is through its C-terminal Gly residue. Because the UBC9 binding site on UBL1 is not close to the C terminus of UBL1, and the C-terminal tail is flexible, the UBL1-E1 conjugate may be flexible relative to each other. From the above-described model of UBC9-UBL1 interaction, the C terminus of UBL1 should extend toward the main β-sheet. Significant chemical shift changes and line broadening have been observed for residues in the β-sheet (Fig. 2 A). In addition, many residues in the β-sheet show larger than average line broadening. Residues 91–95 of UBL1 have overlapping resonances, and therefore, it is not clear whether chemical shift changes and line broadening occurred to these residues. Simple modeling shows that although the binding site on UBC9 is not close to the active-site Cys93, the C-terminal Gly of UBL1 can span the β-sheet to reach Cys93 of UBC9 for conjugation. A region of high sequence conservation have been observed on E2 structures (19Worthylake D.K. Prakash S. Prakash L. Hill C.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6271-6276Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 17Cook W.J. Jeffrey L.C. Xu Y. Chau V. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 13809-13817Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). This region is between the conjugation active-site Cys residue and the second helix and is on the opposite surface from the UBL1 binding site. This surface has been predicted to bind the E1-ubiquitin conjugate. It is possible that this surface binds E1 in the E1-UBL1 conjugate to place the C terminus of UBL1 at the conjugation active site of UBC9. Because the C-terminal residues of ubiquitin and UBL1 are flexible in solution and the binding site of UBL1 on UBC9 does not involve the C terminus, UBL1 and E1 may bind to different surfaces on the E2. E1 should bind to a location close to the active site, because it catalyzes the conjugation between E2 and ubiquitin. The functional importance of the N terminus of E2 has also been implicated from previous studies; however, the exact function is still unclear. Mutating residues 6–8 of Arabidopsis thaliana UBC1 significantly reduces the conjugation of ubiquitin to the E2 (32Sullivan M.L. Vierstra R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23878-23885Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As suggested from the crystal structure of Rad6 (19Worthylake D.K. Prakash S. Prakash L. Hill C.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6271-6276Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), the triple mutation is likely to destabilize the protein structure, because the side chains of both Arg6 and Arg8 are involved in intramolecular hydrogen bonding. Therefore, the effect of these mutations may not be because of the disruption of direct binding interactions. Deletion of residues 1–22 of Rad6 resulted in failure to form a complex with Rad18, which is a single-stranded DNA-binding protein possibly functioning to target Rad6 to sites of DNA damages (29Bailly V. Prakash S. Prakash L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4536-4543Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Because residues 8–22 have extensive contacts with the main structure of Rad6, it is not clear whether deletion of these residues disrupted the structural integrity of the protein. The UBL1-UBC9 system shares many similarities to other E2-ubiquitin systems in the mechanism of conjugation with each other and with other proteins. The binding interfaces between UBL1 and UBC9 are located on the regions that are highly conserved in the three-dimensional structures of E2 and ubiquitin. Therefore, the mechanism of recognition between UBC9 and UBL1 may represent a general feature of E2-ubiquitin interactions. Interestingly, the surface of the E2s that conjugate with ubiquitin does not have highly conserved sequences. This may result in differences in their affinities for the E1-ubiquitin conjugate."

Two sets of ligand peptides, γ chain peptides, which correspond to the sequence at the carboxyl-terminal sequence of the fibrinogen γ chain, and RGD(X) peptides, which correspond to sequences present in all three macromolecular ligands, define the recognition specificity of αIIbβ3 for its macromolecular ligands (reviewed in Ref. 14Plow E.F.

The γ chain and RGD peptides also can elicit ligand-induced binding sites, LIBS, epitopes that are expressed primarily by the occupied receptor but not by its resting or active conformers. Such observations suggest that the binding sites recognized by these peptide ligands are overlapping (17Lam S.C.-T. Plow E.F. Smith M.A. Andrieux A. Ryckwaert J.-J. Marguerie G. Ginsberg M.H. J.

Nevertheless, other observations suggest that these two peptide ligands interact with distinct sites within the macromolecular ligand binding pocket of αIIbβ3 (20Bennett J.S. Shattil S.J. Power J.W.

For example, bifunctional reagents cross-link the two peptides to different subunits of the receptor (26Santoro S.A. Lawing Jr., W.J.

Kurata Y. Loftus J.C. Kunicki T.J. Blood. 1992; 79: 2303-2312Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, even though fibrinogen contains two sets of RGD sequences within its dimeric structure, only its γ chain sequences are essential for a productive interaction of the ligand with the receptor (34Farrell D.H. Thiagarajan P. Chung D.W. Davie E.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10729-10732Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). Thus, the relationship between the peptide binding subsites within αIIbβ3 and the binding pocket for macromolecular ligands remains uncertain.A major limitation in the analyses of the interactions of the peptide ligands with αIIbβ3 is their low affinity for the receptor. Fibrinogen itself has a relatively low affinity for αIIbβ3 (K a = 3 μm−1), and the peptides are estimated to have 30–100-fold lower affinities for the receptor (24Andrieux A. Hudry-Clergeon G.

Certain of the disintegrins derived from snake venoms have high affinities for αIIbβ3 but are still relatively large and complex ligands (36Niewiarowski S. McLane M.A. Kloczewiak M. Stewart G.J. Semin. Hematol. 1994; 31: 289-300PubMed Google Scholar). The high affinity of the disintegrins can be attributed to the placement of peptide ligand sequences, RGD or KGD, within a constraining disulfide loop (37Scarborough R.M. Rose J.W. Hsu M.A. Phillips D.R. Fried V.A. Campbell A.M. Nannizzi L. Charo I.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9359-9362Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Scarborough et al. (38Scarborough R.M. Naughton M.A. Teng W. Rose J.W. Phillips D.R. Nannizzi L. Arfsten A. Campbell A.M. Charo I.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1066-1073Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) synthesized a series of cyclized peptides and demonstrated their high affinity and specificity for αIIbβ3. One of these peptides, cyclo(S,S)KYGCHarGDWPC (cHarGD), was found to be a high affinity surrogate for fibrinogen and its γ chain peptide based upon its reactivity with αIIbβ3 and its sister receptor, αvβ3, under different cation conditions (30Suehiro K. Smith J.W. Plow E.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10365-10371Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar).In this study, we have used cHarGD and a second, very closely related cyclic peptide, cyclo(S,S)KYGCRGDWPC (cRGD), as probes of αIIbβ3 recognition specificity. Both cyclic peptides are shown to react with αIIbβ3 and αVβ3 with high affinities. By using fluorescence energy transfer methodology, we demonstrate that these ligands bind to different sites in the ligand binding domain of αIIbβ3, and the distance between these sites is estimated. A specific recombinant fragment of the β3 subunit is shown to contain one of these sites. Furthermore, occupancy of these sites by the cyclic peptide ligands results in distinct conformational alterations of the receptor and its microenvironment as indicated by distinct patterns of exposure of LIBS epitopes and differential effects on membrane fluidity.DISCUSSIONIn this report, we have utilized two structurally similar but nonidentical cyclic peptides to examine the ligand binding properties of αIIbβ3. Evidence is developed to indicate that cHarGD and cRGD interact with two distinguishable binding sites within αIIbβ3. Moreover, occupancy of these sites by ligand initiates different conformational changes in the receptor which may ultimately lead to distinct functional responses in platelets. These observations shed light on a long-standing question in the αIIbβ3 area regarding the relationship between its peptide ligand-binding sites, may provide insights into how macromolecular ligands may bind to αIIbβ3, and may even be relevant to the biological activities of the new class of antithrombotic drugs, the GPIIb-IIIa blockers (62Topol E.J. Byzova T.V. Plow E.F. Lancet. 1999; 353: 227-231Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar).Fluorescent derivatives of cRGD and cHarGD were developed to aid in our analyses of the interaction of these cyclic peptides with αIIbβ3.N α-Flu-cRGD andN α-Rho-cHarGD were found to have properties functionally analogous to their respective parent cyclic peptides. They bound to αIIbβ3 with high affinity in a cation-dependent manner, could be displaced by nonlabeled peptides, and efficiently inhibited fibrinogen binding to αIIbβ3. Utilization of these labeled peptide ligands in fluorescence resonance energy transfer experiments provided evidence that both probes could bind to the same αIIbβ3 molecules. Since the energy transfer between fluorochromes was largely independent of receptor concentration, and only occurred if the peptides had the opportunity to bind simultaneously to the same receptor, a primary conclusion of this study is that αIIbβ3 expresses two distinct binding sites for these peptide ligands. Based upon the assumptions of the Forster equations, the distance between the two bound fluorophores was estimated to be 6.13 ± 0.5 nm. Molecular models of the two cyclic peptides have been constructed (Insight II, Molecular Simulations, San Diego, CA), and the disulfide bond is predicted to substantially restrict the flexibility of each peptide. The maximum length of the two peptides in these models, from the center of the fluorochrome to the aspartic acid residue is 1.5 ± 0.1 and 0.96 ± 0.017 nm for cHarGD and cRGD, respectively. If the fluorochromes are placed as the most distant residues in the receptor-bound orientation of the two cyclic peptides, overlap between the contact sites would still not be possible.For the purpose of discussion, these two binding sites for the cyclic peptides are designated as A and B. Site A reacts preferentially with cHarGD, and its affinity for ligand is highly modulated by cations. This site does bind its ligand in the presence of Ca2+, but its affinity for cHarGD was significantly increased by Mn2+. Recombinant β3-(95–373) did not bind cHarGD, suggesting that site A is not renatured or not fully located with this recombinant fragment. Site B preferentially interacts with cRGD in the presence of either Ca2+ or Mn2+ and is located in recombinant β3-(95–373). Although sites A and B are spatially and functionally distinct, they are not fully independent. Displacement experiments indicate that the two cyclic peptides can mutually inhibit binding of each other to intact receptor. Whether this cross-talk between sites A and B arises from lack of complete specificity or is allosterically induced cannot be distinguished by the present data. A previous study (30Suehiro K. Smith J.W. Plow E.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10365-10371Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) had suggested that cHarGD is a high affinity surrogate for linear γ-chain peptides based upon its differential reactivity with αIIbβ3 and αvβ3under specific cation conditions. The correspondence between cHarGD and cRGD to linear γ-chain and RGD peptides, respectively, is supported by several additional observations in the present study. First, the two cyclic peptides show the same differential regulation by divalent cations in the reactivity with αIIbβ3 and αvβ3 as observed with the linear peptides,i.e. cHarGD and the γ-chain peptide interact with αIIbβ3 in the presence of Ca2+but Ca2+ inhibits their binding to αvβ3. This inhibitory effect of Ca2+ is not as marked with cRGD or linear RGD peptides. Second, the binding of each cyclic peptide to αIIbβ3 was preferentially inhibited by the corresponding linear peptide. Third, the cyclic peptide and its linear counterpart exerted the same effects on membrane fluidity: cHarGD and the γ-chain peptide increased membrane fluidity, whereas cRGD and the RGD peptide decreased it. Based upon this correspondence, γ-chain peptides would react preferentially with site A and RGD peptides preferentially with site B. The preferential inhibition of cRGD binding by a linear RGD peptide and cHarGD binding by the fibrinogen γ-chain peptide is consistent with this model. A two-site model has been proposed for integrin α5β1, which recognizes the RGD and a synergistic sequence in fibronectin (63Obara M. Kang M.S. Yamada K.M. Cell. 1988; 53: 649-657Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar).As evidenced by the induction of the LIBS epitopes, LIBS1 and PMI-1, occupancy of either site A or site B induced conformational changes in αIIbβ3. However, the pattern of epitope expression was different with the two ligands; binding of cRGD resulted in induction of both LIBS epitopes, whereas binding of cHarGD caused only minimal LIBS1 epitope expression. These results indicate that the occupied receptor can exist in at least two distinct conformational states. Both LIBS epitopes have been at least partially localized: PMI-1 to the carboxyl terminus of the αIIb heavy chain (60Loftus J.C. Plow E.F. Frelinger III, A.L. D'Souza S.E. Dixon D. Lacy J. Sorge J. Ginsberg M.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 7114-7118Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) and LIBS1 to the β3 subunit (47Frelinger III, A.L. Cohen I. Plow E.F. Smith M.A. Roberts J. Lam S.C.-T. Ginsberg M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6346-6352Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, occupancy of site B within β3-(95–373) by cRGD appears to transduce conformational changes in both subunits of the receptor. In view of the long range transmission of conformational changes in αIIbβ3 induced by ligand occupancy (59Du X. Gu M. Weisel J.W. Nagaswami C. Bennett J.S. Bowditch R. Ginsberg M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23087-23092Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), it is not surprising that membrane fluidity might also be influenced by occupancy of sites A and B. However, the two cyclic peptides exerted opposing effects on membrane fluidity as evidenced by their differential alteration of theh +1/h 0 ratio obtained with 5-doxylstearic acid as a probe. Interaction of cRGD with platelets reduced the h +1/h 0 ratio, indicating a significant rigidification of membrane lipid bilayer, whereas cHarGD increased theh +1/h 0 ratio indicating an increase in membrane fluidity. This differential effect is consistent with previous studies in which linear RGD and γ-chain peptides were used in ESR studies (31Watala C. Gwozdzinski K. Pluskota E. Dzieciatkowska E. Cierniewski C.S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 235: 281-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) and supports the hypothesis that cRGD and cHarGD are the respective high affinity analogs of the linear peptides. With the differential transmission of signals from sites A and B, which are likely to reside in the amino-terminal aspects of αIIbβ3, to the membrane proximal LIBS epitopes and then further into the membrane bilayer, it is not unreasonable to suggest that these peptides also would induce different outside-in signaling events. Consistent with this possibility, the linear RGD and γ-chain peptides have been reported to induce different effects on intracellular Ca2+ mobilization (64Rybak M.E. Renzulli L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 14617-14620Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Binding of protein and peptide ligands to integrin receptors is regulated by divalent cations (65Marguerie G.A. Edgington T.S. Plow E.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 154-161Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 66Masumoto A. Hemler M.E. J.

Chem. 1995; 270: 26270-26277Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). Two classes of functionally distinct Ca2+-binding sites have been identified in β3 integrins; the higher affinity sites can be occupied by Ca2+ and other cations and support ligand binding, whereas the lower affinity sites are Ca2+-selective and are inhibitory (68Hu D.D. Barbas III, C.F. Smith J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21745-21751Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Recombinant β3-(95–373) bound fibrinogen in the presence of Mn2+ and low concentrations of Ca2+, whereas high concentrations of Ca2+abolish this interaction. Based on these cation effects, it appears that this domain must contain an inhibitory Ca2+-binding site if not both classes of sites. It should be noted that Gulinoet al. (69Gulino D. Boudignon C. Zhang L.Y. Concord E. Rabiet M.J. Marguerie G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1001-1007Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) concluded that a similar segment of β3 bound fibrinogen in a cation-independent manner. These investigators only employed a high Ca2+ concentration which may have suppressed ligand binding. Thus, our data showing that the level of binding in 1 mm Ca2+ and EDTA is similar are consistent with this previous report. At a structural level, the extracellular domain of αIIbβ3is believed to contain two classes of cation-binding sites. The first class is homologous to the EF-hand structures, such as found in calmodulin, and four such sites are located in αIIbsubunit (55Cierniewski C.S. Haas T.A. Smith J.W. Plow E.F. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 12238-12246Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 69Gulino D. Boudignon C. Zhang L.Y. Concord E. Rabiet M.J. Marguerie G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1001-1007Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The second class is thought to be similar to a metal ion-dependent adhesion site (MIDAS), originally identified in the crystal structures of the I domain of the integrin αL and αM subunits (57Lee J.-O. Rieu P. Arnaout M.A. Liddington R. Cell. 1995; 80: 631-638Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (798) Google Scholar, 70Qu A. Leahy D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10277-10281Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that integrin β subunits, including β3, contain an I domain-like structure with a cation-binding site related (58Tozer E.C. Liddington R.C. Sutcliffe M.J. Smeeton A.H. Loftus J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21978-21984Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar) but not identical (71Lin E.C.K. Ratnikov B.I. Tsai P.M. Gonzalez E.R. McDonald S. Pelletier A.J. Smith J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14236-14243Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) to a MIDAS motif. β3-(95–373), which binds cRGD but not cHarGD, would contain this I domain-like structure with its putative MIDAS motif. Therefore, our data would suggest that this putative MIDAS domain could function as a (not necessarily the only) Ca2+-inhibitory site. Whether this region contains two Ca2+-binding sites is the subject of ongoing investigations.The involvement of sites A and B in fibrinogen binding to αIIbβ3 can only be a subject for speculation at this juncture. Macromolecular proteins such as fibrinogen appear to function as polyvalent ligands and develop multiple contacts with the receptor (72Muller B. Zerwes H.G. Tangeman K. Peter J. Engel J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6800-6808Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Initial docking into the activated integrin is reversible (72Muller B. Zerwes H.G. Tangeman K. Peter J. Engel J. J. Biol.

S. A. 1992; 89: 10729-10732Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). This initial step of ligand recognition was found to be critically dependent upon the presence of cations such as Ca2+ and Mn2+ (68Hu D.D. Barbas III, C.F. Smith J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21745-21751Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 74D'Souza S.E. Haas T.A. Piotrowicz R.S. Byers-Ward V. McGrath D.E. Soule H.R. Cierniewski C.S. Plow E.F. Smith J.W. Cell. 1994; 79: 659-667Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). In the context of our current findings, site A must be occupied for a productive interaction to occur, and divalent cations are required for engagement of site A. As additional contacts develop, including engagement of site B, the receptor-ligand complex becomes stabilized so it becomes nondissociable (65Marguerie G.A. Edgington T.S. Plow E.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 154-161Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 72Muller B. Zerwes H.G. Tangeman K. Peter J. Engel J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6800-6808Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The reversible nature of the interaction of each cyclic peptide with αIIbβ3 is consistent with this multiple contact model. The ligation of site B may be mediated by the natural RGD sequences within the fibrinogen A(α) chain or other sequences that can conform to fit site B. These two basic steps could be distinguished experimentally when fibrinogen binding was evaluated in the presence of RGD peptides (72Muller B. Zerwes H.G. Tangeman K. Peter J. Engel J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6800-6808Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or using a recombinant Fab fragment containing an RGD sequence (68Hu D.D. Barbas III, C.F. Smith J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21745-21751Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The engagement of each contact in sequence may initiate a different wave of conformational change in the receptor, which results in differential induction of LIBS epitopes and the transmission of outside-in signals into the cell. In association with this sequence of events, the platelet membrane would undergo an initial increase in fluidity as the γ-chain binds to site A and then become more rigid as site B is occupied. The latter change should lead to a greater exposure of membrane proteins, including αIIbβ3 and other membrane receptors. This model raises"

Cdc42p is a member of the Rho/Rac family of GTPases, which play an essential role in the signal transduction pathways that lead to the establishment and maintenance of cell polarity and polarized cell growth in eukaryotic cells (1Johnson D.I. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1999; 63: 54-105Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).

These alleles affect different aspects of Cdc42p function, but all lead to defects in bud emergence, suggesting that Cdc42p primarily functions in this process. However, Cdc42p localizes to the tips and sides of the enlarging bud following bud emergence (7Ziman M. Preuss D. Mulholland J. O'Brien J.M. Botstein D. Johnson D.I. Mol. Biol.

The mechanisms by which Cdc42p, in conjunction with various effectors and regulators, selects the bud site and maintains polarized growth throughout the cell cycle are still unclear. There are a number of S. cerevisiae proteins that function as regulators of Cdc42p activity, including the guanine nucleotide exchange factor Cdc24p (9Hart M.J. Eva A. Evans T. Aaronson S.A.

Characterization of bem3 rga1 mutants suggest that the GAPs do not have an essential role in bud emergence, but their elongated bud morphology (17Stevenson B.J. Ferguson B. De Virgilio C. Bi E.

Analysis of these regulators suggests that the regulation of Cdc42p is critical for the establishment of bud emergence and may affect cellular processes later in the cell cycle.

The functional consequences of Cdc42p interactions with its downstream effectors are not clear, but recent experiments using green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged Ste20p suggest that Cdc42p may function in localizing these proteins to the plasma membrane (31Leberer E.

Additionally, Cdc42p and Cla4p function in the localization of the S. cerevisiaeseptin proteins that are thought to be components of the 10-nm filament ring that forms at the bud site prior to budding and remains at the mother-bud neck region through cytokinesis (38Longtine M.S.

To further elucidate Cdc42p cellular function during the cell cycle, the cdc42 V44A allele was characterized. The V44A mutation lies within the Cdc42p effector domain and was originally isolated due to its ability to block two-hybrid protein interactions between Cdc42p and Cdc24p (6Davis C.R. Richman T.R.

The data presented here also show that localization of actin, chitin, and the septin ring was altered in elongated-buddedcdc42 V44A cells while Cdc42V44Ap localization appeared to be normal. In conjunction with studies using aSWE1 CDK inhibitory kinase mutant, which regulates the G2/M morphogenetic checkpoint, these results indicated that the Cdc42V44A mutant protein activated the G2/M checkpoint. Cdc42V44Ap is also defective in its interactions with a subset of CRIB (Cdc42/Racinteractive binding; Ref. 39Burbelo P.D. Drechsel D. Hall A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29071-29074Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar) domain-containing downstream effectors, suggesting that Cdc42V44Ap differentially interacts with these proteins. Taken together, these data highlight Cdc42p differential interactions and show that Cdc42p function is required for timely cell cycle progression.

Intragenic suppression of the cdc42 D118Adominant-negative mutant and the cdc42 G12Vdominant-activated mutant by the V44A mutation in strain W303–1A was determined using plasmids pRS315(pGAL1/10), pRS315(pGAL1-CDC42), pRS315(pGAL1-cdc42 D118A) (5Ziman M.

Transformants were selected on SC−Leu plates at 23 °C and individual transformants were streaked to SC−Leu containing 2% glucose or 2% galactose + 2% raffinose and incubated at 23 °C. To determine if the Cdc42V44Ap could function as the sole copy of Cdc42p within the cell, the integrating plasmid pRS306(cdc42 V44A), which was linearized within the URA3 gene, was transformed into theCDC42/Δcdc42::TRP1 ura3–52/ura3–52diploid DJD6–11; stable Ura+ transformants hadcdc42 V44A, under the control of the endogenousCDC42 promoter, integrated at the ura3 locus. Spores from 11 tetrads were grown at 23 °C and then streaked on selective media to determine marker distributions; segregants that contained the cdc42 V44A mutant allele in a Δcdc42 background were Ura+ Trp+. All Ura+ Trp+ segregants grew at 16 °C, 23 °C, and 30 °C, but not at 37 °C, indicating thatcdc42 V44A encoded a functional protein at low but not high temperatures. One of these temperature-sensitive segregants, designated TRY5–3A, was selected for further study. To characterize the cdc42 V44A phenotype at 37 °C, wild type (C276–4A), cdc42 V44A(TRY5–3A), and cdc42–1 ts (DJTD2–16A) strains were grown at 20 °C in YEPD liquid media to early log phase, at which point half the culture was shifted to the non-permissive temperature of 37 °C for 6 h.

Automated DNA sequencing at the Vermont Cancer Center DNA Sequencing Facility was used to sequence all gene constructs. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed with the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The plasmid pRS315(CLA4) was created by inserting theHindIII plus SacII fragment containing Cla4p from plasmid pBB130 (kindly provided by B. Benton) into pRS315 cut withHindIII plus SacII. YEp351(CLA4) was created by inserting the HindIII plus SacICLA4 fragment from pRS315(CLA4) into YEp351 cut with HindIII plus SacI. pRS315(GFP-CDC3) was created by cutting TD150(GFP-CDC3) (kindly provided by B. Haarer) withBamHI plus NotI to release the GFP-CDC3 fragment, which was ligated to pRS315 cut withBamHI plus NotI. pRS315(GFP-CDC12) was created by cutting TD150(GFP-CDC12) (kindly provided by B. Haarer) with BamHI plus NotI to release the GFP-CDC12 fragment, which was ligated to pRS315 cut withBamHI plus NotI. To create plasmid pAS1-CYH2(cdc42 V44A), pAS1-CYH2(cdc42 V44A,D118A,C188S) (6Davis C.R. Richman T.R. Deliduka S.B. Blaisdell J.O. Collins C.C. Johnson D.I. J. Biol.

To create pRS315(cdc42 V44A,D118A), the C-terminal portion of CDC42 containing the D118A mutation was released from pRS315(cdc42 D118A) (5Ziman M. O'Brien J.M. Ouellette L.A. Church W.R. Johnson D.I. Mol. Cell.

The plasmid p415MET(GFPS65T-A8-CDC42) was constructed by cutting pREP3X(GFP-A8) 2A. Merla and D. I. Johnson, unpublished results. with SpeI and SmaI to release a 730-base pair fragment (containing a GFPS65T C-terminal in-frame fusion with eight alanine residues), which was ligated to p415MET (kindly provided by M. Funk) cut with SpeI and SmaI. TheCDC42 fragment was obtained from pGAL(GFP-CDC42) (kindly provided by J. O′Dell and A. Adams) by cutting withHindIII, blunt ending the site with Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I, and then cutting with SalI. The fragment was then ligated to p415MET25 (GFP-A8) cut with SmaI and SalI. To create p416MET(GFPS65T-A8-CDC42), aSpeI plus XhoI GFPS65T-A8-CDC42 fragment released from p415MET(GFPS65T-A8-CDC42) was subcloned into the SpeI/XhoI-digested p416MET (kindly provided by M. Funk). To create pEG202(cdc42 V44A,C188S),cdc42 V44A was amplified from pAS1-CYH2(cdc42 V44A) by PCR using the Expand Long Template PCR system (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The 5′-primer sequence used in the PCR reaction was GGAATTCCATATGCAAACGCTAAAGTGTG (underlined sequence is an EcoRI site; double underlined sequence is anNdeI site that contains the CDC42 start codon), and the 3′-primer sequence was CGCGGATCCGACTACAAAATTGTAGATTTTTTACTTTTCTTGATAACAGG (underlined sequence contains a BamHI site followed by the CDC42 stop codon and the reverse complement ofCDC42; Cys188 to Ser; underlined G is C in the wild type sequence). The PCR cycling parameters were 30 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 1 min. The resulting 576-base pair PCR fragment was digested withEcoRI plus BamHI and inserted intoEcoRI/BamHI-digested pEG202. The resulting construct was sequenced to verify the fusion andcdc42 V44A,C188S sequence. pEG202(cdc42 G12V,V44A,C188S) was created using the QuikChangeTM site-directed mutagenesis kit from Stratagene. pEG202(cdc42 V44A,C188S) was the DNA template for the mutagenesis. The nucleotide sequence of the forward mutagenic primer was GTCGGTGATGTTGCTGTTGGGAAAACG (Gly12 to Val; underlined T is G in the wild type sequence), and the reverse mutagenic primer was CGTTTTCCCAACAGCAACAT-CACCGAC (Gly12 to Val; underlined A is C in the wild type sequence). The cycling parameters for the mutagenesis were 12 cycles of 95 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 30 s, and 68 °C for 21 min. pRS315(pGAL1-cdc42 G12V,V44A) was also created using the QuikChangeTM kit, pRS315(cdc42 V44A) as the DNA template, and the mutagenic primers containing the G12V mutation and cycling parameters described above. The resulting plasmid pRS315(cdc42 G12V,V44A) was cut withNdeI to release the cdc42 G12V,V44Afragment, which was inserted into pRS315(pGAL1-CDC42) cut with NdeI. Sequencing of both plasmids resulting from the mutagenesis confirmed the sequence of the cdc42 G12V,V44A,C188S andcdc42 G12V,V44A alleles. p416MET(GFPS65T-A8-cdc42 V44A) was also created using the QuikChangeTM kit with p416MET(GFPS65T-A8-CDC42) as the DNA template. The nucleotide sequence of the forward mutagenic primer was CGATAACTATGCGGTGACTGCGATGATTGGTGATGAACC (Val44 to Ala; underlined C is T in the wild type sequence) and the reverse mutagenic primer was GGTTCATCACCAATCATCGCAGTCACCGCATAGTTATCG (Val44to Ala; underlined G is A in the wild type sequence). The cycling parameters for the mutagenesis were as above. The methods for performing two-hybrid analysis have been described previously (45Chien C.-T. Bartel P.L. Sternglanz R. Fields S. Proc. Natl.

https://openalex.org/W2067481095,"In vertebrates, synapsins constitute a family of synaptic vesicle proteins encoded by three genes. Synapsins contain a central ATP-binding domain, the C-domain, that is highly homologous between synapsins and evolutionarily conserved in invertebrates. The crystal structure of the C-domain from synapsin I revealed that it constitutes a large (>300 amino acids), independently folded domain that forms a tight dimer with or without bound ATP. We now show that the C-domains of all synapsins form homodimers, and that in addition, C-domains from different synapsins associate into heterodimers. This conclusion is based on four findings: 1) in yeast two-hybrid screens with full-length synapsin IIa as a bait, the most frequently isolated prey cDNAs encoded the C-domain of synapsins; 2) quantitative yeast two-hybrid protein-protein binding assays demonstrated pairwise strong interactions between all synapsins; 3) immunoprecipitations from transfected COS cells confirmed that synapsin II heteromultimerizes with synapsins I and III in intact cells, and similar results were obtained with bacterial expression systems; and 4) quantification of the synapsin III level in synapsin I/II double knockout mice showed that the level of synapsin III is decreased by 50%, indicating that heteromultimerization of synapsin III with synapsins I or II occursin vivo and is required for protein stabilization. These data suggest that synapsins coat the surface of synaptic vesicles as homo- and heterodimers in which the C-domains of the various subunits have distinct regulatory properties and are flanked by variable C-terminal sequences. The data also imply that synapsin III does not compensate for the loss of synapsins I and II in the double knockout mice.

The data also imply that synapsin III does not compensate for the loss of synapsins I and II in the double knockout mice. Synapsins constitute a family of abundant synaptic vesicle proteins that are peripheral membrane proteins, and they are attached to the vesicle by an unknown mechanism (1Greengard P. Mol.

Of these, the genes encoding synapsins Ia, Ib, IIa, and IIb were characterized first (3Südhof T.C. Czernik A.J. Kao H. Takei K. Johnston P.A. Horiuchi A. Wagner M. Kanazir S.D. Perin M.S. DeCamilli P. Greengard P. Science. 1989; 245: 1474-1480Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar), whereas the gene encoding synapsin IIIa (no synapsin IIIb has been found) was identified more recently (4Hosaka M.

Synapsins Ia and Ib are the most abundant synapsin isoforms, and synapsin IIIa is the least abundant synapsin isoform. All synapsins share a conserved N-terminal phosphorylation site of unknown function that is a substrate for cAMP-dependent protein kinase A and Ca2+, calmodulin-dependent protein kinase I. In addition, synapsins Ia and Ib and possibly other synapsins contain multiple phosphorylation sites for a large number of kinases including Ca2+, calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II and proline-directed kinases (6Huttner W.B.

Sequence analyses revealed that synapsins are composed of conserved N-terminal and central domains that are shared between all synapsins and variable C-terminal domains that differ between synapsins (3Südhof T.C. Czernik A.J. Kao H. Takei K. Johnston P.A. Horiuchi A. Wagner M. Kanazir S.D. Perin M.S. DeCamilli P. Greengard P. Science. 1989; 245: 1474-1480Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). The largest domain of synapsins is the central C-domain, which measures more than 300 residues and is the only domain that is conserved in invertebrate synapsin (10Klagges B.R.E. Heimbeck G.

The C-domain is flanked on the N terminus by short A- and B-domains; the A-domain contains the only phosphorylation site that is present in all synapsins. On the C terminus, the C-domain is followed by two to three variable domains that differ between synapsins except for the E-domain, a shared domain found at the very C-terminal domain of synapsins Ia, IIa, and IIIa but not synapsin Ib or IIb (3Südhof T.C.

Although synapsins bind to a number of proteins in vitro, including all elements of the cytoskeleton (actin, microtubules, neurofilaments, and spectrin) and multiple Ca2+-binding proteins (calmodulin and annexin VI), their functions have remained obscure (reviewed in Refs. 11Südhof T.C.

Even the detailed analysis of knockout mice lacking both synapsins I and II showed only that synapsins perform essential functions in regulating exocytosis of synaptic vesicles and that synaptic vesicles are destabilized without synapsins (13Rosahl T.W.

These functions agree well with the vesicular localization and stoichiometric phosphorylation of synapsins but do not tell us what synapsins actually do. A clue to the functions of synapsins was obtained recently from an unexpected direction: the crystal structure of the C-domain of synapsin I revealed that it is highly homologous to bacterial ATP-dependent synthetases, indicating an enzyme function (16Esser L.

In support of an enzyme function of synapsins, biochemical studies demonstrated that the C-domains of all synapsins bind ATP with high affinity (3Südhof T.C. Czernik A.J. Kao H. Takei K.

Chem. 1998; 273: 1425-1429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Interestingly, ATP-binding to the three synapsin C-domains is differentially regulated. Ca2+ is required for ATP binding to synapsin I but inhibits ATP binding to synapsin III and has no effect on ATP binding to synapsin II (4Hosaka M. Südhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13371-13374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 17Hosaka M. Südhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1425-1429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). In synapsins I and II, the difference in Ca2+ regulation was found to be due to a single, evolutionarily conserved amino acid residue that differs between the two synapsins (17Hosaka M. Südhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1425-1429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The biochemical and crystallographic studies established that synapsins are evolutionarily conserved ATP-binding proteins in which ATP binding is differentially regulated, providing a rationale for the existence of multiple synapsins. However, the studies have not yet identified an enzyme activity associated with synapsins, which remains to be demonstrated. In addition to revealing that synapsin C-domains are ATP-binding proteins, the crystal structure also demonstrated that the C-domain of synapsin I forms a dimer in the presence or absence of ATP (16Esser L. Wang C.-R. Hosaka M. Smagula C.S. Südhof T.C. Deisenhofer J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 977-984Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The contact surface between the two subunits in the dimer is very large, indicating a stable interaction. Because the C-domains of different synapsins are homologous to each other, questions arise as to whether other synapsins also form homodimers and whether the three synapsins associate into heterodimers. Such heterodimers would link together synapsin isoforms that presumably perform similar functions via their C-domains but that perform these functions in the context of distinct regulatory properties. In the current study, we performed yeast two-hybrid screens with the original intention of identifying possible substrates for the C-domain ATPase. Upon analysis, however, we found that the large majority of the specific prey clones isolated encode synapsins, suggesting that synapsins are their own major binding partners. We then identified the mechanism of multimerization and showed that it occurs in vivo. Finally, we analyzed synapsin I and II double knockout mice (which still express synapsin III) to determine whether synapsin III changes in these mice. Our results demonstrate that synapsins form homo- and heterodimers in vivo and in vitro, thereby creating a multitude of combinations of synapsins on the synaptic vesicle surface.

The following vectors were used containing the following inserts: 1) pLexNSynI-C, residues 110–420 of rat synapsin Ia; 2) pLexN SynIIa, residues 1–586 of rat synapsin IIa; 3) pLexNSynIII-C, residues 89–399 of rat synapsin IIIa; 4) pVP-SynI1–624, residues 1–624 of rat synapsin I; 5) pVP-SynII91–479, residues 91–479 of rat synapsin II; and 6) pVP-SynIII-C, residues 89–399 of rat synapsin IIIa. Yeast strain L40 was co-transfected with bait and prey vectors using lithium acetate. Transformants were plated on selection plates lacking uracil, tryptophane, and leucine. After 3 days of incubation at 30 °C, colonies were inoculated into supplemented minimal medium lacking uracil, tryptophane, and leucine and placed in a shaking incubator at 30 °C for 48 h. β-Galactosidase assays were performed on yeast extracts with protein concentrations of 20–40 mg/liter/assay (21Rose M.D. Winston F. Hieter P. Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1990Google Scholar). Polyclonal pan-synapsin antibodies (E028) were raised against a peptide containing the N-terminal sequence found in all synapsins (NYLRRRLSDSNFMANLPNGYMTDLQTPQP). Polyclonal synapsin III antibodies (U549 and U551) were generated against a peptide with a synapsin III-specific sequence (CATERRHPQPLAASF). All peptides were coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin. The monoclonal antibody to synapsin I (Cl10.22) was a gift from Dr. R. Jahn, and the NMDA receptor antibody was a gift from Dr. N. Brose. All vectors encoding GST 1The abbreviations used are: GST, glutathioneS-transferase; X-gal, 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl β-d-galactopyranoside -synapsins were described previously (4Hosaka M.

For expression as a His6-fusion protein, the C-domain of synapsin I was cloned from pGexrSynI-C (17Hosaka M. Südhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1425-1429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) into the BamHI-SalI sites of pET28a (Novagen) to obtain pETrSynI-C. Various pET and pGEX constructs were co-transformed into BL21 (DE3) cells, selected simultaneously with ampicillin and kanamycin, and purified on glutathione-agarose or Ni2+-NTA resin as suggested by the manufacturer. For expression of synapsins in COS cells, the coding region of the bovine cDNA of synapsin Ia was cloned into the EcoRI-HindIII sites of vector pCB1, yielding pCMVbSynIa. Rat cDNAs of synapsin IIa and IIIa were cloned into theBglII and ClaI sites or the EcoRI site of pCMV5 to construct pCMVrSynIIa and pCMVrSynIIIa, respectively. Plasmid DNAs were transfected into COS cells with various combinations of synapsins using DEAE-dextran, and transfected cells were harvested 48 h after transfection as described previously (22Gorman C. Glover D.M. DNA Cloning. II. IRL Press, Oxford1985: 143-190Google Scholar, 23Missler M. Südhof T.C. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 3630-3638Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). COS cells transfected with various synapsins were analyzed by immunoblotting using the various synapsin antibodies. For immunoprecipitations, transfected COS cells were solubilized in 20 mm HEPES/NaOH, pH 7.4, 0.1 m NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 mg/liter aprotinin, 2 mg/liter antipain, 1 mg/liter pepstatin, and 1 mg/liter leupeptin. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation (10,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C). Soluble extracts were incubated in 1 ml of solubilization buffer with 10 μl of polyclonal antibody or 2 μl of monoclonal antibody under rotation at 4 °C; controls received no primary antibody. 30 μl of a 50% slurry of protein A- or protein G-Sepharose were then added, the reaction was incubated overnight at 4 °C, and samples were centrifuged, washed in solubilization buffer, and analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by immunoblotting. Brain homogenates from wild type or mutant mice lacking synapsins I and II (double knockouts) were analyzed by 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting (10 μg of protein/lane) on the same gels to control for variations in protein transfer. Blots were probed with antibodies to NMDA-receptor, synaptophysin, and synapsin III using ECL detection or125I-labeled antibodies (for quantification by a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager). Eight mice of each genotype were analyzed with two different antibodies to ensure reproducibility. The genotype was confirmed by immunoblotting for synapsins I and II. To standardize the immunoblotting signals, all blots were simultaneously probed for NMDA receptors and either synaptophysin or synapsin III. To identify proteins that bind to synapsins, we screened a rat brain cDNA library with full-length synapsin IIa as a bait by yeast two-hybrid selection (18Vojtek A.B. Hollenberg S.M. Cooper J.A. Cell. 1993; 74: 205-214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1660) Google Scholar, 19Hata Y. Butz S. Südhof T.C. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 2488-2494Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Okamoto M.

Yeast two-hybrid methods were used because the stickiness of synapsins as purified proteins, as documented in their multitude of in vitro interactions, interferes with clear-cut interpretations. Synapsin II was chosen instead of synapsin I because synapsin I contains a positively charged C terminus with a tendency for binding artifacts, and synapsin IIa was used instead of synapsin IIb because synapsin IIa contains a C-terminal E-domain that is also present in synapsins Ia and IIIa (3Südhof T.C. Czernik A.J. Kao H. Takei K. Johnston P.A. Horiuchi A. Wagner M. Kanazir S.D. Perin M.S. DeCamilli P. Greengard P. Science. 1989; 245: 1474-1480Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar, 4Hosaka M.

Greengard P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4667-4672Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). More than 200 prey clones were isolated. Sequencing of 65 of these revealed that only three proteins were selected multiple times as independent overlapping clones (Table I). 45 of the 65 sequenced prey clones encoded synapsin I or synapsin II; thus, synapsins account for the majority of the clones isolated. Nine clones encoded an unidentified protein present as an EST sequence in the data banks (EST108711). RNA blots indicated that the mRNA for this protein is not enriched in brain but is ubiquitously distributed (data not shown), and tests with irrelevant bait vectors suggested that the EST108711 clones were mildly autoactivating. Thus, it seems probable that their interaction with synapsins is an artifact. Finally, four clones were from two distinct isoforms of 14-3-3 proteins that we have frequently isolated in yeast two-hybrid screens with other baits and may also represent an artifact. Indeed, synapsin immunoprecipitations failed to co-precipitate 14-3-3 proteins, indicating that they do not bind to synapsins physiologically (data not shown). The isolation of synapsin I and II prey clones in yeast two-hybrid screens with a synapsin IIa bait suggests that synapsin II forms dimers by self-association and forms heterodimers by association with synapsin I. Synapsin III may not have been isolated in the yeast two-hybrid screens because it is present at low levels in brain. In the synapsin I crystal structure, the C-domain forms a tight dimer with a large contact area (16Esser L. Wang C.-R. Hosaka M. Smagula C.S. Südhof T.C. Deisenhofer J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 977-984Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Thus, it seemed likely that the interaction of synapsins I and II with themselves and each other is mediated via their C-domain. To test this hypothesis and to correlate the crystal structure with yeast two-hybrid methods, we measured the binding of synapsin IIa to various fragments of synapsin Ib in yeast two-hybrid assays (Fig.1). Full-length synapsin Ib and fragments containing residues 117–451 interacted with synapsin IIa, whereas fragments composed of residues 123–415 or less were inactive. Thus, the full-length C-domain appears to be required for binding in the yeast two-hybrid assays, confirming the correlation between the yeast two-hybrid and structural approaches. We next investigated whether synapsins I and II also interact with synapsin III in yeast two-hybrid assays and whether the various interactions exhibit similar strengths. For this purpose, we constructed prey and bait vectors containing synapsins I, II, and III. In the L40 yeast strain, interactions of bait and prey proteins that are expressed in the yeast cells activate a β-galactosidase gene (18Vojtek A.B. Hollenberg S.M. Cooper J.A. Cell. 1993; 74: 205-214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1660) Google Scholar). Therefore, as a quantitative measure of binding of the synapsins to each other and to control proteins (lamin and synaptotagmin 1), we determined the β-galactosidase activities in yeast cells that were transformed with the various synapsin and control bait and prey vectors. These experiments demonstrated that all three synapsins interact with themselves and also bind to each other (Fig.2). Synapsin II bound equally strongly to itself and to synapsins I and III. Similarly, the interactions of synapsin I with synapsin II and of synapsin II with synapsin III were similar in magnitude to the interactions of these synapsins with themselves. Only the binding of synapsin I to synapsin III was significantly weaker (Fig. 2). No binding of synapsins to control proteins or vectors was observed, indicating that the observed interactions are specific (Fig. 2). The yeast two-hybrid studies indicated that synapsins I, II, and III form homo- and heterodimers via interactions between their C-domains, with the heterodimerization between synapsins I and III being much weaker than all other dimerization events. In preparation for an analysis of such interactions on the protein level, we raised two antibodies to a peptide from the N terminus of synapsin III and characterized the relative specificities of these and other antibodies to synapsins. In these experiments, we used COS cells transfected with the various synapsin expression vectors and utilized three types of antibodies: 1) a monoclonal antibody to synapsin I, 2) the two polyclonal antibodies against synapsin III, and 3) a polyclonal antibody generated against a peptide from the N terminus of synapsin I with a sequence that is similarly found in synapsins II and III. The synapsin I antibody and one of the synapsin III antibodies were found to be specific for their respective isoforms, indicating that these antibodies can be used to probe only these synapsins (Fig.3). The second synapsin III antibody also recognized synapsin I in addition to synapsin III (see below). The antibody against the conserved N-terminal peptide of synapsins reacted with all three synapsins, as expected, and therefore represents a pan-synapsin antibody. On the immunoblots, synapsin I is the largest protein, whereas synapsin III is the smallest protein, allowing an unequivocal identification of each synapsin on immunoblots, even with the pan-synapsin antibody (Fig. 3). To determine whether synapsin heteromultimerization occursin vivo and is not an artifact of yeast two-hybrid assays, we co-transfected COS cells with synapsins I and II or with synapsin II alone (Fig. 4 A, lanes 1 and4). We then immunoprecipitated extracts from the transfected COS cells with the synapsin I monoclonal antibody and analyzed the immunoprecipitates by immunoblotting with the pan-synapsin antibody (Fig. 4 A, lanes 2 and 5). As a control, identical reactions were performed without the primary antibody (Fig. 4 A, lane 3). The synapsin I antibody co-precipitated synapsin II. The ratio of synapsin II to I was lower in the immunoprecipitates than in the COS cells, which is consistent with the notion that synapsin I is complexed both into homodimers and into heterodimers. In the absence of synapsin I, no synapsin II was precipitated by synapsin I antibodies, demonstrating specificity (Fig. 4 A, lane 5). Similarly, no synapsins were brought down in control immunoprecipitations (Fig.4 A, lane 3). These data show that synapsins I and II heterodimerize in transfected COS cells. We next performed similar experiments for synapsins II and III, using the synapsin III-specific antibody for immunoprecipitation and the pan-synapsin antibody for immunoblotting (Fig. 4 B). However, in this case, the antibodies used for immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting are both polyclonal, leading to an increased background labeling of IgG. For this reason, we performed the immunoprecipitations with the two independent synapsin III antibodies. Despite the background reactivity for IgG, the two bands corresponding to co-precipitated synapsins II and III could be clearly identified in the immunoprecipitates with synapsin III antibodies from co-transfected COS cells but not in those from COS cells transfected with synapsin II alone (Fig. 4 B, arrows in lanes 3 and6). However, when we attempted similar experiments for synapsins I and III, we were unsuccessful in demonstrating an interaction (data not shown). Therefore, synapsins II and III dimerize not only in yeast two-hybrid assays but also in transfected COS cells, whereas the binding of synapsin I to synapsin III is less certain. The relatively weak interactions of synapsins I and III in yeast two-hybrid assays compared with other synapsin pairs and our failure to demonstrate synapsin I/III heterodimers in immunoprecipitations raise the possibility that the binding of synapsins I and III may be too weak to allow the formation of a stable dimer. To test this directly, we expressed GST-synapsins I, II, and III and His6-synapsin I singly or in combination in bacteria and purified the recombinant proteins on glutathione-agarose and nickel columns. The presence of GST- and His6-synapsins in the purified protein fractions was then examined using Coomassie Blue-stained SDS gels and immunoblotting (Fig.5; data not shown). The results show that the GST-fusion proteins exhibited much higher expression levels, resulting in a very low abundance of heterodimers in glutathione-agarose-purified recombinant proteins. His6-synapsin I dimerization with GST-synapsin I and GST-synapsin II but not with GST-synapsin III could be detected (Fig.5, top panel). When we turned the experiment around and purified His6-synapsin I on nickel columns, a nearly stoichiometric binding of GST-synapsins I and II was found, whereas synapsin III was absent (Fig. 5, bottom panel). Because GST-synapsin III was abundantly expressed in the bacteria, these results indicate that synapsin III indeed does not stably dimerize with synapsin I. Knockout mice lacking synapsins I and II are viable and fertile but exhibit severe changes in the regulation of neurotransmitter release (13Rosahl T.W. Geppert M. Spillane D. Herz J. Hammer R.E. Malenka R.C. Südhof T.C. Cell. 1993; 75: 661-670Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar, 14Rosahl T.W. Spillane D. Missler M. Herz J. Selig D.K. Wolff J.R. Hammer R.E. Malenka R.C. Südhof T.C. Nature. 1995; 375: 488-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar). In addition, synaptic vesicles are destabilized in these mice, and the levels of vesicle proteins are decreased. At the time of the analysis of these knockout mice, however, the existence of a third synapsin isoform (synapsin III) was unknown. Synapsin III is expressed only at low levels; it seems unlikely that it could functionally substitute for synapsins I and II at physiological expression levels. However, it is possible that synapsin III expression may have been induced in the knockouts and obscured a more severe synapsin knockout phenotype by compensating for the loss of synapsins I and II. Conversely, some proteins that form heteromultimeric complexes with other proteins become unstable when their binding partners are not available (e.g. see Ref. 24Woods C.M. Lazarides E. Cell. 1985; 40: 959-969Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Thus, it is also possible that synapsin III levels could actually be decreased in the double knockout mice. To address these questions, we investigated the levels of synapsin IIIa compared with the levels of a synaptic vesicle protein, synaptophysin, and to a general synaptic marker, NMDA receptor, in wild type and synapsin I and II double knockout mice. Brain homogenates from wild type and double knockout mice were analyzed by immunoblotting with four antibodies: the two independent antibodies to synapsin III, an antibody to the NMDA receptor as a control protein that does not change in the knockouts, and an antibody to synaptophysin as a synaptic vesicle protein that was previously shown to decrease by approximately 30% in the double knockouts (14Rosahl T.W. Spillane D. Missler M. Herz J. Selig D.K. Wolff J.R. Hammer R.E. Malenka R.C. Südhof T.C. Nature. 1995; 375: 488-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar). Because the endogenous synapsin III levels in the brain are very low, synapsin III immunoreactivity is weak, and peptide blocks were used to ensure that the various bands were specific. One of the synapsin III antibodies we raised cross-reacts with synapsin I; the corresponding band is absent in the knockouts, whereas the lower synapsin III band is still recognizable (Fig. 6, top panel). Both synapsin III antibodies react with additional brain proteins on immunoblots in a nonspecific reaction that cannot be blocked with the peptide (Fig. 6, asterisks). Comparison of the patterns of reactivity between the two antibodies failed to uncover a smaller specific band that could correspond to synapsin IIIb, suggesting that the synapsin III gene only produces a synapsin IIIa product (data not shown). On the immunoblots, synapsin III can be clearly recognized in the double knockout mice, but it seems to be decreased, not increased. This suggests that synapsin III is not induced in the knockout but may actually be destabilized (Fig. 6). To obtain a quantitative measure of this, we performed immunoblots with 125I-labeled secondary antibodies and detected the signal with a PhosphorImager. In agreement with previous results, an analysis of multiple mice showed that synaptophysin levels were decreased by approximately 30% in the double knockouts compared with the NMDA receptor levels. Synapsin IIIa levels, however, were depressed even further (by 50%; Fig.7). Statistical analysis showed that the decrease in synaptophysin and synapsin IIIa levels from wild type to double knockout mice was highly significant. More importantly, the relative decrease in synapsin IIIa levels compared with synaptophysin levels in the double knockouts was also statistically validated (p < 10−8). This result demonstrates that the decrease in synapsin IIIa is not only due to the loss of synaptic vesicles but represents a further decrease that cannot be accounted for by the general destabilization of synaptic vesicles (Fig. 7). Synapsins are peripheral membrane proteins of synaptic vesicles that are stoichiometrically phosphorylated upon stimulation (1Greengard P. Mol.

There are at least three synapsin genes (I, II, and III) directing the synthesis of at least five synapsins (Ia, Ib, IIa, IIb, and IIIa). The various synapsins are composed of similar N-terminal and central domains followed by variable C-terminal domains (3Südhof T.C. Czernik A.J. Kao H. Takei K. Johnston P.A. Horiuchi A. Wagner M.

Although the precise functions of synapsins are unknown, analysis of knockout mice revealed an essential role for synapsins I and II in regulating synaptic vesicle exocytosis and in stabilizing synaptic vesicles (13Rosahl T.W.

Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 1219-1227Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Together with the crystallographic and biochemical analysis of ATP binding to synapsins, the current data suggest that synapsins are enzymes that act on the synaptic vesicle in an unknown manner. The crystal structure of the C-domain of synapsin I uncovered two striking properties of this large, autonomously folded domain: 1) its structural homology to ATP-dependent synthases, and 2) its association into tightly bound dimers (16Esser L. Wang C.-R. Hosaka M. Smagula C.S. Südhof T.C. Deisenhofer J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 977-984Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Biochemical analysis of the C-domains from all synapsins showed that each C-domain constitutes an ATP-binding module with strikingly different regulatory properties (4Hosaka M. Südhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13371-13374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar,17Hosaka M. Südhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1425-1429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The homology between the synapsin C-domains and their similar ATP binding properties now raise the questions of whether other synapsins besides synapsin I form homodimers and whether synapsins associate into heterodimers in addition to homodimers. This is a potentially important question because homo- and heterodimerization of synapsins would imply that synaptic vesicles are coated by a multitude of different synapsin dimers with distinct regulatory properties. Because different synapsins are differentially expressed in neurons in a regulated manner (3Südhof T.C. Czernik A.J. Kao H. Takei K. Johnston P.A. Horiuchi A. Wagner M. Kanazir S.D. Perin M.S.

Neuroscience. 1997; 79: 329-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), the exact composition of the coat of synapsin dimers on the synaptic vesicle surface could serve as a mechanism by which the properties of the vesicles are regulated. Four findings reported in the current study support the conclusion that all synapsins associate into such homo- and heterodimers: 1) In yeast two-hybrid screens with full-length synapsin IIa as a bait, synapsins I and II were isolated in 45 of 65 preys analyzed. Synapsin III presumably was not found because of its low abundance. Because yeast two-hybrid screens represent an unbiased approach to evaluating protein-protein interactions, the dominance of synapsins in the preys selected suggests that the major binding partner of a synapsin molecule is another synapsin molecule. 2) Quantitative measurements using yeast two-hybrid assays confirmed that all three synapsin C-domains homodimerize and heterodimerize in strong, pairwise interactions. We observed an almost equal degree of binding between synapsins I and II and between synapsins II and III. In addition, a strong but less intense interaction was observed between synapsins I and III. These findings agree well with the fact that ATP binding is Ca2+-dependent for synapsin I, Ca2+-independent for synapsin II, and Ca2+-inhibited for synapsin III. Thus, by the strength of the interactions, dimers between synapsins that are either induced by Ca2+ or inhibited by Ca2+ would be least likely to form. 3) In transfected COS cells, immunoprecipitation of synapsin I co-precipitated co-transfected synapsin II. Similarly, immunoprecipitation of synapsin III co-precipitated co-transfected synapsin II. These data show that the synapsin I/II and II/III heterodimers occur at the protein level. No synapsin I/III dimers were observed. The heterodimerization of synapsins I and II and the lack of stable synapsin I/III heterodimers were confirmed in bacterial expression experiments that revealed that even in the presence of high levels of synapsins I and III, no stable binding occurred. 4) Finally, in knockout mice lacking synapsins I and II, we found that the levels of synapsin III were reduced beyond the general decrease observed for synaptic vesicle proteins in these knockout mice. Previous studies had shown that synaptic vesicles are destabilized in synapsin I/II double knockout mice, leading to an overall reduction in vesicle proteins of approximately 30% (14Rosahl T.W. Spillane D. Missler M. Herz J. Selig D.K. Wolff J.R. Hammer R.E. Malenka R.C. Südhof T.C. Nature. 1995; 375: 488-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar). This was confirmed in the present study in which the level of the synaptic vesicle protein synaptophysin was reduced by 30%. The level of synapsin III, however, was decreased significantly more to approximately 50%. This result indicates that synapsin III is disproportionately destabilized, which is consistent with the notion that it is normally present in a dimer with other synapsins and is destabilized in the absence of these synapsins. In summary, our results demonstrate that synapsins homo- and heteromultimerize with variable efficiency. All synapsins strongly homodimerize; in addition, synapsin II forms strong heterodimers with synapsins I and III, whereas synapsins I and III interact only weakly, if at all. These data suggest that synapsins exist on the vesicle surface as obligatory dimers. As a result, up to 13 distinct combinations of synapsin dimers may be formed by the five different synapsins on the synaptic vesicle surface. The data portray synapsins as a multigene family of synaptic vesicle proteins that are more variable than previously imagined. We thank Dr. M. Okamoto for the yeast two-hybrid library, Drs. J.

Similar to many other extracellular matrix molecules, it is composed of serially arranged structural units called protein domains (1Engel J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1991; 3: 779-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The amino-terminal sequence contributes to the central knob, a cysteine-rich structure that assembles six TN-C monomers via disulfide bridges to form the native hexameric protein (the hexabrachion; Ref. 2Erickson H.P. Inglesias J.L. Nature. 1984; 311: 267-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). This region is followed by 14.5 epidermal growth factor-type repeats and eight FNIII domains in the shortest TN-C variant. The sequence is terminated by a domain homologous to the β and γ chains of fibrinogen (3Weller A. Beck S. Ekblom P. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 112: 355-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 4Saga Y. Tsukamoto T. Jing N. Kusakabe M. Sakakura T. Gene (Amst.). 1991; 104: 177-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Larger isoforms of mouse TN-C are generated by the insertion of up to six additional alternatively spliced FNIII domains between the fifth and sixth FNIII domain of the smallest TN-C variant. These alternatively spliced domains have been named A1, A2, A4, B, C, and D, according to their counterparts in human TN-C (5Vrucinic-Filipi N. Chiquet-Ehrismann R. Symp. Soc. Exp.

Res. 1994; 37: 336-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar).TN-C is expressed in a variety of tissues and is thought to play a role in mesenchymal-epidermal interactions during organ development but also under conditions of tissue remodeling in the adult organism such as wound healing and tumor growth (7Erickson H.P.

In the central nervous system, TN-C is predominantly expressed by astrocytes and radial glia at early stages of development, whereas its expression is down-regulated during tissue differentiation (10Bartsch S. Bartsch U. Dörries U. Faissner A. Weller A. Ekblom P. Schachner M. J. Neurosci. 1992; 12: 736-749Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Mitrovic N. Dörries U. Schachner M. J.

In the adult animal, the protein is restricted to a few brain regions, e.g. the molecular layer of the cerebellum, the olfactory bulb, the retina, and the optic nerve head (10Bartsch S. Bartsch U.

Neurosci. 1994; 14: 4756-4768Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The expression of TN-C in the central nervous system (CNS) has attracted special interest because of the inhibitory (16Faissner A. Kruse J. Neuron. 1990; 5: 627-637Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar) and stimulatory actions the molecule can exert in different in vitro assays (summarized in Ref. 9Faissner A. Cell Tissue Res. 1997; 290: 331-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). The diverse functions of the molecule could be localized to distinct functional domains within the protein using proteolytic fragments or fusion proteins encompassing defined structural units of TN-C (17Spring J. Beck K. Chiquet-Ehrismann R. Cell. 1989; 59: 325-334Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar, 18Prieto A.L. Andersson-Fisone C. Crossin K.L. J.

Fusion proteins comprising all alternatively spliced domains have been found to down-regulate focal adhesion integrity of aortic endothelial cells (21Murphy-Ullrich J.E. Lightner V.A. Aukhil I. Yan Y.Z. Erickson H.P. Hook M. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 1127-1136Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar) and to support short-term adhesion of embryonic and early postnatal neurons, but not long-term adhesion (19Götz B. Scholze A. Clement A. Joester A. Schütte K. Wigger F. Frank R. Spiess E. Ekblom P. Faissner A. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 681-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Fusion proteins consisting of the FNIII domains A1, A2, and A4 (TNfnA124) exhibited repulsive properties, whereas the fusion proteins TNfnBD and, to a lesser extent, TNfnD6 showed a pronounced neurite outgrowth-promoting effect on hippocampal neurons (19Götz B. Scholze A. Clement A. Joester A. Schütte K. Wigger F. Frank R. Spiess E. Ekblom P. Faissner A. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 681-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar).The functional role of TN-C in vivo might be modified either by alternative splicing of the primary transcript or by post-translational modifications. Interestingly, most of the potential glycosylation sites are found within the FNIII domains that are subject to alternative splicing (22Gulcher J.R. Nies D.E. Marton L.S. Stefansson K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 1588-1592Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). With six alternatively spliced FNIII domains, each of which can potentially be absent or present, up to 64 isoforms can theoretically be generated. Of these, only seven have been identified thus far in mouse tissue or cell lines (3Weller A. Beck S. Ekblom P. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 112: 355-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 4Saga Y. Tsukamoto T. Jing N. Kusakabe M. Sakakura T. Gene (Amst.). 1991; 104: 177-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 6Dörries U. Schachner M. J. Neurosci. Res. 1994; 37: 336-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar).Previous studies have primarily focused on combinations of adjacent domains. These investigations do not take into account that nonadjacent FNIII domains also might be combined by alternative splicing, thereby possibly generating novel recognition sites for TN-C receptors and mediating specific functions of the molecule. In this study, we show the expression of a large variety of TN-C isoforms in mouse brain, most of which are novel. Furthermore, we provide evidence that specific TN-C isoforms are developmentally regulated.DISCUSSIONThe study of TN-C isoforms on the mRNA level in mouse brain revealed the expression of six alternatively spliced FNIII domains. In contrast, a total of nine alternatively spliced domains has been identified in human TN-C (23Siri A. Carnemolla B. Saginati M. Leprini A. Casari G. Baralle F. Zardi L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 525-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 24Sriramarao P. Bourdon M.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 163-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 26Mighell A.J. Thompson J. Hume W.J. Markham A.F. Robinson P.A. Int. J.

Chem. 1991; 266: 2818-2823Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These are, following the 5′ to 3′ arrangement on the gene, the domains A1, A2, A3, A4, B, AD2, AD1, C, and D. TN-C sequence motifs in different species display a high degree of homology, which reaches 95% for analogous FNIII domains. On this basis, the six alternatively spliced FNIII domains found in mouse TN-C were identified as the mouse homologues of human A1, A2, A4, B, C, and D (5Vrucinic-Filipi N. Chiquet-Ehrismann R. Symp. Soc. Exp. Biol. 1993; 47: 155-162PubMed Google Scholar, 6Dörries U. Schachner M. J. Neurosci. Res. 1994; 37: 336-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Studies on the expression of the FNIII domains AD1 and AD2 in E10 chick spinal cord revealed low expression of AD1 in a restricted subpopulation of TN-C-expressing cells, e.g. a subpopulation of cells within the ependymal layer, but no expression by radial glia. In contrast, expression of AD2 was not detected (28Derr L.B. Chiquet-Ehrismann R. Gandour-Edwards R. Spence J. Tucker R.P. Differentiation. 1997; 62: 71-82Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In E14 brain, only cells located in the ventricular zone of the optic tectum showed expression of AD1, which was not included in TN-C mRNA in other brain areas (28Derr L.B. Chiquet-Ehrismann R. Gandour-Edwards R. Spence J. Tucker R.P. Differentiation. 1997; 62: 71-82Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is unclear whether these findings can be transferred to the mouse nervous system, because the territories of TN-C expression vary in different species (29Rettig W.J. Hoffman S. Su S.L. Garin-Chesa P. Brain Res. 1992; 590: 219-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Along these lines, FNIII domain C was concluded to be CNS-specific according to in situ hybridization studies carried out on E15 mouse (6Dörries U. Schachner M. J. Neurosci. Res. 1994; 37: 336-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), but it was found to be completely absent from spinal cord in chicken E10 embryos (28Derr L.B. Chiquet-Ehrismann R. Gandour-Edwards R. Spence J. Tucker R.P. Differentiation. 1997; 62: 71-82Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It has been proposed that in the human the expression of particular splice variants comprising AD1 is tumor-associated (24Sriramarao P. Bourdon M.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 163-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), and domain AD2 was documented in two of four specimens of squamous cell carcinomas studied (26Mighell A.J. Thompson J. Hume W.J. Markham A.F. Robinson P.A. Int. J. Cancer. 1997; 72: 236-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In the present study using a RT-PCR-based strategy, no evidence was obtained for the expression of the mouse homologues of FNIII domains A3, AD2, or AD1 in brain tissue at any of the developmental stages studied. Furthermore, no hints at the expression of alternatively spliced FNIII domains other than A1, A2, A4, B, C, and D were obtained by screening more than 1,000 RT-PCR products spanning the splice site of mouse TN-C. Nevertheless, the expression of FNIII domains equivalent to human TN-C domains A3, AD1, and AD2 in other mouse tissues or in the CNS at developmental stages different from those investigated in this study cannot be excluded. From an evolutionary point of view, the existence of mouse TN-C domains equivalent to the recently discovered AD1 and AD2 is highly probable because both domains were identified in avian and human TN-C. In contrast to these, at present, domain A3 has only been detected in human TN-C. In the well-studied chicken TN-C molecule, only one A domain has been described (25Tucker R.P. Spring J. Baumgartner S. Martin D. Hagios C. Poss P.M. Chiquet-Ehrismann R. Development. 1994; 120: 637-647PubMed Google Scholar). These findings may suggest that the domains AD1 and AD2 arose from duplication events that occurred before the avian and mammalian species diverged and should thus be inherited by rodents as well. In contrast, the different A domains found in mammals presumably evolved later; therefore, the A3 domain might be unique for primate TN-C. A careful analysis of the genomic sequence is required to ultimately identify the subset of alternatively spliced FNIII domains present in the mouse TN-C gene.The RT-PCR strategy using primers upstream and downstream of the splice site located between the fifth and sixth FNIII cassette of TN-C yielded products that represented integral multiples of one to six FNIII domains. This result supports the conclusion that TN-C isoforms of all possible sizes that can be generated with six domains are expressed in mouse brain. Although RT-PCR is primarily a qualitative technique, it can provide some insight into the relative abundance of alternatively spliced transcripts of given sizes. Interestingly, the amount of product obtained by RT-PCR for the different size classes differed in a way that was not directly correlated with the lengths of the inserts. This finding opposes the general experience that smaller products are amplified more readily than larger ones in PCR. In the case of TN-C, the largest alternatively spliced RT-PCR product exhibited an intensity second only to that of the shortest product, whereas the intermediately sized products of three and four FNIII domains were amplified to a lower extent. Thus, the RT-PCR results support the notion that expression of differentially sized TN-C isoforms is regulated and is not merely a reflection of a random production of variants due to the failure of the splicing apparatus to include some or all of the potentially available domains.The FNIII domain-specific probes that were generated for the purpose of this study proved to be efficient tools for decoding TN-C isoforms. Due to the fluorescein label, the probes could reliably be used over a prolonged time period without a substantial loss of activity. Adjustment of the concentrations applied in hybridization procedures was required due to the differential labeling efficiency of the various probes. No clear relationship between sequence composition,e.g. AT content, and labeling efficiency could be established. After the adjustment of concentrations, the seven different probes recognized the respective target sequences with comparable sensitivities. High stringency conditions were chosen for hybridization to avoid cross-reactions of the probes with nonspecific target sequences. On average, the alternatively spliced FNIII domains share 52% of their nucleotide sequence. The lowest degree of similarity is recorded between A2 and D (41%), and the highest degree of similarity was recorded between A1 and A4 (80%). Interestingly, the constitutively expressed FNIII domains 1–8 only display an average degree of sequence identity of 44%, whereas the sequence homology between the constitutive and the alternatively spliced FNIII domains is even lower, with an average value of 40%. This points to close evolutionary relationships within these two groups of FNIII domains.Screening of RT-PCR products of the alternatively spliced transcripts revealed the expression of a complex but restricted repertoire of different TN-C isoforms in the developing mouse brain. 27 TN-C isoforms were identified, of which 22 had not been previously reported. The 27 TN-C isoforms identified in mouse brain represent 42% of the 64 possible combinatorial TN-C variants that can be achieved with six independently arranged cassettes. The present study is the first that combines the amplification of the complete alternatively spliced region with a systematic analysis of representative numbers of single RT-PCR products. Other investigations dealing with the isoform variability of TN-C have used RT-PCR to amplify shorter stretches within the region of alternative splicing, thereby identifying combinations of up to four domains, but not entire isoforms (25Tucker R.P. Spring J. Baumgartner S. Martin D. Hagios C. Poss P.M. Chiquet-Ehrismann R. Development. 1994; 120: 637-647PubMed Google Scholar, 26Mighell A.J. Thompson J. Hume W.J. Markham A.F. Robinson P.A. Int. J. Cancer. 1997; 72: 236-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Others have not taken into account that TN-C isoforms of identical size might not be homogenous with regard to domain composition (6Dörries U. Schachner M. J. Neurosci. Res. 1994; 37: 336-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The screening strategy developed in this study allowed the resolution of six populations of RT-PCR products. Within each size class, substantial heterogeneity of FNIII domain composition was revealed. Due to the screening procedure, the relative frequencies of given isoforms could only be compared within a given size category. For example, the CD variant made up two-thirds of the two-domain group of TN-C isoforms in P6 cerebellum, whereas the combination A1D represented the other third of these isoforms. Two other variants, namely, A1A2 and A4B, were found to be relatively rare.FNIII domain D was detected in most of the splice variants expressed in mouse brain. Within each size class of isoforms, the D domain containing splice variants made up more than 88% of the inserts. The only exception was noted within the four-domain forms, where D was present in only 65% of all the RT products analyzed, whereas domain A4 was found in 95% of these isoforms in P6 cerebellum. Considering the general organizational features of TN-C isoforms, it is striking that FNIII domain C was found to occur in conjunction with domain D in all cases studied thus far, thereby excluding the direct transition between domain C and 6. This observation is in agreement with analogous reports for normal, malignant, and reactive oral mucosae (26Mighell A.J. Thompson J. Hume W.J. Markham A.F. Robinson P.A. Int. J. Cancer. 1997; 72: 236-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Interestingly, of the 28 possible transitions between pairs of FNIII domains, only 2 were not realized in TN-C isoforms in the developing mouse brain: (a) the transition between domains C and 6, and (b) that between domains A4 and C. Total exclusion of these junctions for any size class would decrease the number of potential TN-C isoforms by 20. Additional studies have to show whether these junctions are generally prohibited. If this proves to be the case, these sequences, in comparison to those found frequently, might be interesting candidates for the study of specific splicing factors.None of the six alternatively spliced FNIII domains was confined exclusively to one specific TN-C isoform. In particular, domain C, which had been assigned earlier to the largest TN-C isoform only (6Dörries U. Schachner M. J. Neurosci. Res. 1994; 37: 336-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), was also detected in smaller forms. The occurrence of this domain in isoforms with two additional FNIII domains proved to be of special interest in the context of developmental regulation. The expression of the CD-containing isoform dominated during late embryonic development (E16), representing more than 90% of the isoforms of this size. The prevalence of this variant decreased toward birth and increased again at the end of the first postnatal week. This might indicate the involvement of this isoform in specific developmental processes. In late embryonic development, neuron generation reaches a maximum, and the neurons migrate toward their destination within the forming cortical layers and finally differentiate. Neuronal migration and neurite outgrowth are processes that have been found to be influenced by TN-C in vitro (summarized in Ref. 30Faissner A. Crossin K.L. Tenascin and Other Counteradhesive Molecules of the Extracellular Matrix. Harwood Academic, Amsterdam, The Netherlands1996: 47-87Google Scholar). During the first two postnatal weeks, the cerebellum is generating its structure, being one of the last parts of the brain to differentiate (31Altmann J. Palay S. Chan-Palay V. The Cerebellum: New Vistas. Springer, Berlin, Germany1982: 8-49Google Scholar). In situ hybridization has shown the cerebellum to be the major source of TN-C at P6.2 Therefore, the CD isoform might be of particular importance for the process of differentiation at E16 as well as at P6.Until now, studies on TN-C isoform expression, regulation, and function have focused primarily on the comparison of the smallest TN-C isoform with the largest TN-C isoform. Generally, high molecular weight TN-C transcripts or proteins were found to be associated with motile cells (32Kaplony A. Zimmermann D.R. Fischer R.W. Imhof B.A. Odermatt B.F. Winterhalter K.H. Vaughan L. Development. 1991; 112: 605-614Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and enriched in tissues undergoing dynamic remodeling (33Tucker R.P. Development. 1993; 117: 347-358Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Different factors have been described to influence the expression of TN-C isoforms, for example, extracellular pH, TGF-β1, and bFGF (34Borsi L. Allemanni G. Gaggero B. Zardi L. Int. J. Cancer. 1996; 66: 632-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 35Zhao Y. Young S.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: L173-L180PubMed Google Scholar, 36Pearson C.A. Pearson D. Shibahara S.

The present study shows that a large variety of TN-C isoforms are expressed in the developing brain and that their expression is developmentally regulated. With its many isoforms, TN-C has the potential of encoding positional specificities of astrocytes and, consequently, specific microenvironments for different neuronal populations. Whether particular isoforms display topologically restricted expression patterns will be the focus of additional studies.

Similar to many other extracellular matrix molecules, it is composed of serially arranged structural units called protein domains (1Engel J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1991; 3: 779-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The amino-terminal sequence contributes to the central knob, a cysteine-rich structure that assembles six TN-C monomers via disulfide bridges to form the native hexameric protein (the hexabrachion; Ref. 2Erickson H.P. Inglesias J.L. Nature. 1984; 311: 267-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). This region is followed by 14.5 epidermal growth factor-type repeats and eight FNIII domains in the shortest TN-C variant. The sequence is terminated by a domain homologous to the β and γ chains of fibrinogen (3Weller A. Beck S. Ekblom P. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 112: 355-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 4Saga Y. Tsukamoto T. Jing N. Kusakabe M. Sakakura T. Gene (Amst.). 1991; 104: 177-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Larger isoforms of mouse TN-C are generated by the insertion of up to six additional alternatively spliced FNIII domains between the fifth and sixth FNIII domain of the smallest TN-C variant. These alternatively spliced domains have been named A1, A2, A4, B, C, and D, according to their counterparts in human TN-C (5Vrucinic-Filipi N. Chiquet-Ehrismann R. Symp. Soc. Exp.

TN-C is expressed in a variety of tissues and is thought to play a role in mesenchymal-epidermal interactions during organ development but also under conditions of tissue remodeling in the adult organism such as wound healing and tumor growth (7Erickson H.P.

In the central nervous system, TN-C is predominantly expressed by astrocytes and radial glia at early stages of development, whereas its expression is down-regulated during tissue differentiation (10Bartsch S. Bartsch U. Dörries U. Faissner A. Weller A. Ekblom P. Schachner M. J. Neurosci. 1992; 12: 736-749Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Mitrovic N. Dörries U. Schachner M. J.

In the adult animal, the protein is restricted to a few brain regions, e.g. the molecular layer of the cerebellum, the olfactory bulb, the retina, and the optic nerve head (10Bartsch S. Bartsch U.

https://openalex.org/W2134511166,"Stem cell factor (SCF) and its tyrosine kinase receptor, c-Kit, play a crucial role in regulating migration and proliferation of melanoblasts, germ cells, and hemopoietic cell progenitors by activating a number of intracellular signaling molecules. Here we report that SCF stimulation of myeloid cells or fibroblasts ectopically expressing c-Kit induces physical association with and tyrosine phosphorylation of three signal transducers and activators of transcription (STATs) as follows: STAT1α, STAT5A, and STAT5B. Other STAT proteins are not recruited upon SCF stimulation. Recruitment of STATs leads to their dimerization, nuclear translocation, and binding to specific promoter-responsive elements. Whereas STAT1α, possibly in the form of homodimers, binds to the<i>sis</i>-inducible DNA element, STAT5 proteins, either as STAT5A/STAT5B or STAT5/STAT1α heterodimers, bind to the prolactin-inducible element of the β-casein promoter. The tyrosine kinase activity of Kit appears essential for STAT activation since a kinase-defective mutant lacking a kinase insert domain was inactive in STAT signaling. However, another mutant that lacked the carboxyl-terminal region retained STAT1α activation and nuclear translocation but was unable to fully activate STAT5 proteins, although it mediated their transient phosphorylation. These results indicate that different intracellular domains of c-Kit are involved in activation of the various STAT proteins."

Their lipid products (PtdIns3P, PtdIns(3,4)P2, and PtdIns(3,4,5)P3) function as second messengers in eukaryotic cells. Indeed, PI 3-kinases appear to be involved in the control of a host of cellular responses ranging from intracellular transport to cell motility and the suppression of apoptosis (see Refs. 1Toker A.

The regulatory subunits contain two SH2 domains which allow the enzyme to bind to, and be activated by key phosphotyrosine residues found in the cytoplasmic tails of growth factor receptors and various adapter proteins (11Carpenter C.L.

Although several reports show that both the biological effects of p110γ and its intrinsic sensitivity to Gβγ are substantially amplified by the presence of p101, some data suggest that p110γ alone can be substantially catalytically activated by Gβγ and have clear biological effects (14Stoyanov B. Volinia S. Hanck T. Rubio I. Loubtechenkov M. Malek D. Stoyanova S. Vanhaesebroeck B. Dhand R. Nürnberg B. Gierschik P. Seedorf K. Hsuan J.J. Waterfield M.D. Wetzker P.

We have begun to address the issue of the role of p101, if any, in these events by analyzing the regions of p101 involved in interactions with p110γ and furthermore, for those constructs that bind, how they affect the activation of the complex by Gβγ. We analyzed also the part played by p110γ in the process of Gβγ activation and p101 binding. All point mutations, novel N or C termini, and internal deletions within porcine p101 cDNA were done using polymerase chain reaction-based strategies with mutagenic primers and Taq polymerase (Promega). Polymerase chain reaction-generated fragments were ligated back into pCMV3 with an N-terminal (EE)- or Myc-tag for expression in mammalian cells and into pAcOG3 with an N-terminal (EE)-tag for constructing baculovirus transfer vectors. All polymerase chain reaction-generated inserts were sequenced. N- and C-terminal deletions of the human p110γ were either done by digesting with the appropriate restriction enzymes at designated sites. The isolated DNA fragments were religated into pcDNA3 containing N-terminal Myc-tag linkers. The Ras-binding domain deletions were done by fusing the internal fragments in-frame to the N-terminal 169 amino acids, creating a three amino acid linker. Full-length human p101 was cloned into an N-terminal EE-tag containing pcDNA3 vector. Sf9 cells were grown in TNM-FH medium with 11% fetal bovine serum in spinner flasks at 27 °C at 0.5–2 × 106 cells/ml. COS-7 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum. Sf9 cells were lipofected using Insectin (Invitrogen) liposomes with baculogold (Pharmingen) linearized baculoviral DNA and a baculovirus transfer vector. Viral particles were plaque purified prior to amplification. Infection times were 2.3 days for p101 and 1.8 days for p110γ. Harvested cells were pelleted, washed in 7 mm NaH2PO4 (pH 6.2), 20 mm MgCl2, 0.7% KCl, 2.66% sucrose, snap frozen in liquid N2 and stored at −80 °C. 6H-tagged porcine p110γ and EE-tagged porcine p101 were purified as described previously (12Stephens L.R. Eguinoa A. Erdjument-Bromage H. Lui M. Cooke F. Coadwell J. Smrcka A.S. Thelen M. Cadwallader K. Tempst P. Hawkins P.T.

The p110γ purification was modified as follows. Buffer C was 50 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.1, 4 °C), 1% betaine, 0.05% Tween 20, 0.1 m NaCl; buffer D was 1% betaine, 30 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.5, 4 °C), 0.15m NaCl, 0.02% Tween 20, 10% ethylene glycol; buffer E was as C supplemented with 7 mm imidazole (pH 7.5, 4 °C); elution was in buffer F which was as C supplemented with 100 mm imidazole (pH 7.5, 4 °C). Eluted p110γ in buffer F was supplemented with 1 mm dithiothreitol and 1 mm EGTA (F′) or, if it was to be bound to p101, passed through a PD10 column (Pharmacia) equilibrated in buffer H (10 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.5, 4 °C), 0.15 m NaCl, 1% betaine, 0.02% Tween 20, 10% ethylene glycol, 1 mmMgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mmEGTA, 1% Triton X-100). In some cases, the p110γ (6H)-tag was cleaved with thrombin (Sigma) at 12 units/ml at 4 °C for 12 h. The p101 purification was modified as follows, cells were sonicated into 0.15 m NaCl, 25 mm Hepes (pH 7.2, 4 °C), 2 mm EGTA, 1 mm MgCl2plus antiproteases; cytoplasmic fractions were not pre-cleared with anti-Myc beads; washes after the anti-EE beads (Onyx Pharmaceuticals) were five times in 0.4 m NaCl, 20 mm Hepes (pH 7.4, 4 °C), 1 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.4% cholate, and three further times in buffer H. To bind the subunits, p101 bound to packed anti-EE beads was mixed end on end for 2.5 h with a 25-fold molar excess of free p110γ in a small volume of buffer H. Heterodimer on anti-EE beads was washed in buffer J (1% Triton X-100, 0.15 m NaCl, 20 mm Hepes (pH 7.4, 4 °C), 1 mm EGTA) and in buffer F′. p101-p110γ heterodimer was eluted in buffer F′ supplemented with 125 μg/ml EY peptide (EYMPTD). Typical yields were 2 mg of p110γ and 25 μg of p101/500 ml of Sf9 culture. GST-p110γ (the relevant recombinant baculovirus was a gift from R. Wetzker and encoded the human form of the protein) was purified from cytosolic fractions or Triton X-100 lysates of Sf9 cells as described by Leopoldt et al. (Ref. 15Leopoldt D. Hanck T. Exner T. Maier U. Wetzker R. Nürnberg B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7024-7029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar and references therein). This GST construct could not be cleaved by thrombin to yield full-length untagged p110γ. Exponentially growing COS-7 cells were trypsinized, washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline, and resuspended in 30 mm NaCl, 0.12 mKCl, 8.1 mm Na2HPO4, 1.46 mm KH2PO4, 5 mmMgCl2 at 1 × 107 cells/450 μl. They were mixed with 30 μg of plasmid DNA (15 μg of pCMV3(EE)101 constructs and 15 μg of pCMV3(myc)110γ or 15–30 μg of irrelevant plasmid DNA) per 107 cells aliquot. Aliquots were placed into 0.4-cm gap electroporation cuvettes (Bio-Rad) and electroporated in a single pulse (250 V, 980 microfarads). Cells from each electroporation were seeded into 175-ml tissue culture flasks in full growth medium. After 28 h, cells were harvested by trypsinization, washed once in phosphate-buffered saline, and cell pellets lysed in 1 × phosphate-buffered saline, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100. Cytoplasmic fractions were immunoprecipitated with anti-EE beads followed by washes in 2 × phosphate-buffered saline, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100. Samples for PI 3-kinase assays were washed further in 25 mm Hepes (pH 7.4, 4 °C), 1 mm EGTA. Remaining samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE. Gels were either Coomassie stained or wet-blotted onto polyvinylidene fluoride membranes (Millipore) and immunoblotted according to their tags with anti-Myc antibody (obtained from Onyx Pharmaceuticals) and anti-EE ascites fluid (Babco) or with an anti-p101 antiserum (Microchemical Facilities, Babraham Institute). Free, purified protein from Sf9 cells or COS-7 derived protein on anti-EE beads was diluted in sample dilution buffer (2 mg/ml fatty acid free bovine serum albumin, 0.1m KCl, 20 mm Hepes (pH 7.4, 4 °C), 1 mm dithiothreitol). Lipid mixtures containing phosphatidylethanolamine and PtdIns(4,5)P2 were dried down and sonicated into 0.1 m NaCl, 25 mm Hepes (pH 7.4, 4 °C), 1 mm EGTA, 0.1% cholate for final concentrations of 50 μm phosphatidylethanolamine (Sigma) and 5 μm PtdIns(4,5)P2 (13Stephens L. Smrcka A. Cooke F.T. Jackson T.J. Sternweis P. Hawkins P.T. Cell. 1994; 77: 83-93Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar). They were supplemented with G protein βγ subunits (prepared as in Ref. 16Sternweis P.C. Pang C.H. Receptor Effector Coupling: A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, Oxford1990: 1-30Google Scholar) or its vehicle (1% cholate, 0.15 m NaCl, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 5 mm EGTA, 0.2 mm EDTA) to a final concentration of 0.3 μm Gβγ. [γ-32P]ATP was diluted to a concentration of 5 μCi/10 μl into 0.1 m NaCl, 25 mm Hepes (pH 7.4, 4 °C), 1 mm EGTA. For the assay, 5 μl of diluted protein were kept on ice until 20 μl of lipid mixture with or without Gβγ was added and the mixture transferred to a 30 °C waterbath. 4 min later, 50 μl more sample dilution buffer supplemented with MgCl2 to give a final concentration of 3.5 mm was added, another 4 min later, 10 μl of diluted ATP was added. Assays were stopped after 12 min incorporation time by addition of 160 μl of 1.25 m HCl. Assays were extracted with 800 μl of CHCl3:MeOH (2:1) and then with CHCl3, MeOH, 1 m HCl (3:48:47). Lipids were deacylated and resolved on PEI TLC plates as described before (13Stephens L. Smrcka A. Cooke F.T. Jackson T.J. Sternweis P. Hawkins P.T. Cell. 1994; 77: 83-93Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar). Alternatively, assays were conducted precisely as described by Leopoldtet al. (15Leopoldt D. Hanck T. Exner T. Maier U. Wetzker R. Nürnberg B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7024-7029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar) with PtdIns acting as the substrate. First, we simply reproduced the results of previous work showing purified p110γ could bind p101 both in vitro and in vivo and that this association substantially increased the scale of activation of the PI 3-kinase with Gβγ from 1–2-fold to 50–150-fold, but now using modified procedures and porcine and human versions of the proteins. Human p101 (GenBank accession numberAF128881) was 88% identical to porcine p101 (c.f. human p110γ is 94% idential to porcine p110γ). We found the species orthologs behaved interchangeably in these assays and gave results identical to those of the earlier work (Ref. 12Stephens L.R. Eguinoa A. Erdjument-Bromage H. Lui M. Cooke F. Coadwell J. Smrcka A.S. Thelen M. Cadwallader K. Tempst P. Hawkins P.T. Cell. 1997; 89: 105-114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar, data not shown). In order to understand the interactions between p101 and p110γ and the ability of the heterodimer to respond to Gβγ subunits, we made panels of p101 and p110γ constructs. Analysis of p101 structures involved in binding to p110γ was first approached with the following assay. NH2-terminal (EE)-tagged p101 constructs were purified from Sf9 cells using anti-(EE)-beads. After washing, an excess of purified, NH2-terminal (6H)-tagged full-length p110γ from Sf9 cells was mixed with the immobilized p101 constructs. The beads were washed again and eluted with an epitope (EY) peptide. The released proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and PI 3-kinase assays with and without Gβγ subunits. This analysis revealed that all of the p101 constructs tested (Fig.1 A) had reduced, but still significant capacity to specifically bind p110γ relative to full-length. Thus both the large N-and C-terminal truncations of p101 (Δ1–163 and 1–733) resulted in a 50% reduction in the recovery of p110γ, while Δ283–581 reduced recovery by about 25% (Fig.1 B). Some p110γ specifically bound to N-terminal (p101 1–163) and C-terminal fragments of p101 (p101Δ1–574) (about 10 and 30% of wild-type, respectively) (Fig. 1 C). All p101-p110γ heterodimers were also assayed for PI 3-kinase activity in the presence or absence of Gβγ (Fig.1 D). All of the heterodimers created containing p101 truncations and deletions had reduced activation by G protein βγ subunits. It is striking, however, that the N-terminal truncation (Δ1–163) completely abrogated activation by Gβγ, while the remaining truncations resulted merely in decreased ability of the respective heterodimers to be activated by Gβγ. Neither N- nor C-terminal p101 peptides bound to p110γ yielded considerable activation when assayed in the presence of Gβγ subunits. Overall this suggests a number of regions in p101 are involved in its ability to interact with p110γ, particularly the N and C termini. Similarly, multiple areas in p101 are required for heterodimers to give maximal activation by Gβγ subunits, however, the N terminus is absolutely required for this process. To address issues such as (a) the possibility that purification and our handling of the p101 constructs had resulted in varying levels of denaturation and that this effect generated the differential binding we observed, and (b) that some binding only occurs in vitro in the absence of competing proteins found in the cell, we examined the ability of p101 derivatives to bind to p110γ when the proteins are transiently co-expressed in COS-7 cells. In addition, to allow for more detailed mapping of the impact of different areas of p101 on both binding to p110γ and activation of the heterodimer with Gβγ, a number of further constructs were introduced (Fig. 2 A). All p101 constructs were (EE)-tagged and co-expressed with (Myc)-tagged p110γ in COS-7 cells in transient transfection assays. Cytosolic fractions of harvested cells were subjected to anti-(EE) immunoprecipitations, half of which were used to estimate binding stoichiometries on gels or blots (see Fig. 2 B, for an example) while the other half was assayed for PI 3-kinase activity in the presence or absence of G protein βγ subunits. The data describing binding of p101 derivatives to p110γ in this assay is summarized in Fig. 2 C. Binding to p110γ was affected in all p101 constructs except for the point mutations and DE328–341STP constructs, supporting the conclusion from the in vitro studies indicating that more than one area of p101 contributes to binding p110γ. It appears, however, that in the COS-7 cell assays compared with the in vitro assays, the N-terminal deletions lead to a larger decrease in p110γ binding ability than C-terminal deletions (25 versus 70% binding) and N-terminal peptides can rescue more binding than C-terminal peptides (50 versus 12% binding). We also assayed all constructs immunoprecipitated from COS-7 cells for PI 3-kinase activity. The resulting data (Fig. 2 D) underlines the data already obtained from the in vitroassays from Sf9-produced protein. Again, we found that both C and N termini of p101 contribute to full activation of the complex by G protein βγ subunits. Any deletion within p101 interfered with the ability of the heterodimer to be completely activated. Interestingly, deletion of the C-terminal 150 amino acids (1–733 and p84) and deletion of much larger C-terminal portions (1–314, 1–265, and 1–163) lead to a similar decrease in activation by Gβγto less than 25% of that of full-length p101, stressing the role for the very C-terminal part. The most dramatic result, however, is induced by deletion of the very N-terminal portion of p101 (constructs Δ1–153 and Δ1–263) which lead to complete loss of activation, confirming the conclusions from the in vitro assays that this region of p101 is essential for activation of the complex by G protein βγ subunits. To define the sites in p110γ involved in both interaction with p101 and activation by Gβγ, we prepared a set of constructs shown in Fig.3 for expression in COS-7 and Sf9 cells. These constructs were used in assays aimed at defining the regions that interacted with p101 that were relevant to the Gβγ activation of p101-p110γ heterodimers and were required for basal PI 3-kinase activity. Increasing N-terminal truncation of p110γ systematically reduced its basal catalytic activity (Fig. 4 A). Deletions beyond residue 369 had no detectable PI 3-kinase activity. N-terminal tags seemed to increase the basal catalytic activity of p110γ. The activity of the N-terminal (6H)-tagged p110γ (6H-p110γ) was reduced 2-fold by removal of the tag with thrombin and the activity of defined p110γ constructs was reduced by half by switching from an N-terminal to a C-terminal (6H)-tag. Furthermore, N-terminal (GST)-tagged p110γ (GST-p110γ) possessed an approximately 10–15-fold higher specific activity than wild-type p110γ. In contrast, and as previously reported (12Stephens L.R. Eguinoa A. Erdjument-Bromage H. Lui M. Cooke F. Coadwell J. Smrcka A.S. Thelen M. Cadwallader K. Tempst P. Hawkins P.T. Cell. 1997; 89: 105-114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar), binding of p101 reduced the basal catalytic activity of p110γ by 5-fold. Reports that GST-p110γ can be substantially activated by Gβγ in vitro (15Leopoldt D. Hanck T. Exner T. Maier U. Wetzker R. Nürnberg B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7024-7029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar) lead us to test the effect of manipulating p110γ structure on its responsiveness to Gβγ, despite the fact that we have never detected significant effects of Gβγ on porcine p110γ activity in the absence of p101. Testing a range of catalytically active porcine and human p110γ constructs with or without N-terminal or C-terminal (6H) tags in the presence and absence of Gβγ showed up to 2-fold activations of human (but not porcine) proteins with either our standard assay procedure or that of Leopoldt et al. (15; see below). However, with human GST-p110γ we found that although our assay procedure (using PtdIns(4,5)P2 and 3.5 mmMgCl2) failed to reveal any activation by Gβγ, using PtdIns and 10 mmMgCl2 in the assay (15Leopoldt D. Hanck T. Exner T. Maier U. Wetzker R. Nürnberg B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7024-7029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar), we could reproducibly detect 6–7-fold activations by Gβγ (Fig. 4 B); this was unaffected if the constructs were purified from membrane or cytosolic fractions (data not shown). Experiments performed with proteins expressed in either COS-7 or Sf9 cells indicated that the N terminus of p110γ was critical for binding to p101. p110γ deletions through the series Δ1–122, Δ1–133, and Δ1–144 (Fig.5 A, for examples) showed decreasing ability to bind p101, a Δ1–169 construct showed no detectable binding (Fig. 5 B). However, other regions were clearly involved in binding p101 (see Fig. 5 C for an overview). Hence, N-terminal peptides (e.g. 1–169) had low p101 binding potential and further deletion of either the Ras-binding domain (178–330) or the central regions (330–775) of p110γ also significantly reduced p101 binding. It is significant that those p110γ constructs capable of binding p101, once bound, were all very similarly activated by Gβγ (Fig. 5 D). Catalytically active p110γ constructs incapable of binding p101 remained insensitive to Gβγ when assayed in the presence of p101 (Fig. 5 C). It is clear from the above results that multiple regions of p101 are involved in either direct (i.e. physical contact) or indirect interactions with p110γ. Interestingly, the Gβγ sensitivity of the p110γ heterodimers formed by using various p101 constructs clearly correlated with how tightly they formed heterodimers, but absolutely depended on the presence of the N terminus of p101. We have previously published some binding data showing Gβγ can apparently bind about five times more effectively to p101 than p110γ (12Stephens L.R. Eguinoa A. Erdjument-Bromage H. Lui M. Cooke F. Coadwell J. Smrcka A.S. Thelen M. Cadwallader K. Tempst P. Hawkins P.T. Cell. 1997; 89: 105-114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar), but we cannot discount important binding of Gβγ to p110γ, as others have identified clear effects of Gβγ on GST-p110γ (13, 15; see also Fig. 4 B). There are, therefore, two types of explanation for this data. First, that a lot of the contacts between p101 and p110γ are required for Gβγ to have their full effects on p110γ catalytic activity (whether the Gβγ bind to p101, p110γ, or both). Second, that the primary sites of Gβγ binding that influence the activity of the heterodimer are located on p101 and are “co-incidentally” disrupted by changes which impinge on p101-p110γ interaction. This apparently highly interwoven structure-function relationship between p101, Gβγ, and p110γ is not surprising if it is accepted that binding of p101 and Gβγ can have such a profound effect on the catalytic site in p110γ. The binding site for p101 in p110γ, although primarily involving the N terminus of the protein, is a far larger region extending deeper into the protein. Considering the fact that several parts of p101 are involved in binding to p110γ, it would seem reasonable that a substantial piece of p110γ is involved in binding p101 (note that in p110α a relatively short region of the N terminus is thought to bind to a short inter-SH2 domain segment of p85 (17Dhand R. Hara K. Hiles I. Bax B. Gout I. Panayotou G. Fry M.J. Yonezawa K. Kasuga M. Waterfield M.D. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 511-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar, 18Hu P. Schlessinger J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2577-2583Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar)). In contrast to the situation with p101, where deletions affecting the total contact area and strength of binding to p110γ also affected the sensitivity of the heterodimer to Gβγ, deletions through the N terminus of p110γ, that reduced the efficiency of binding to p101, had no effect on the activation of heterodimeric enzyme that could be recovered. Clearly, this analysis cannot be complete because deletions removing more than 200 N-terminal residues begin to strongly reduce the intrinsic catalytic activity of p110γ, such that deletions beyond residue 369 activity is completely lost (see below), yet these deeper regions are clearly involved in binding to p101. However, the implication of this data is that some of the contacts between p101 and p110γ, involved in their binding, can be eliminated by disruptions on the p110γ side without effect on Gβγ activation of the heterodimer, but that contacts broken by p101 disruptions reduce the ability of Gβγ to activate the enzyme. The simplest explanation for these observations is that p101 disruptions are also interfering with Gβγ-binding sites that are most important for activation of the heterodimer; i.e. that the latter of our proposed models (see above) is most likely to be correct. In the process of engineering and assaying a range of p110γ constructs it became clear that the N terminus of the protein had significant potential to influence catalytic activity. Hence the addition of N-terminal GST and (6H)-tags apparently increased the activity of the enzyme. In contrast, binding of p101, which appears to interact most strongly with the N terminus of p110γ lead to a 5-fold inhibition of basal catalytic activity. This effect of p101 appears to have some parallels with observations that p85 binding to p110α suppresses its PI 3-kinase catalytic activity (19Yu J. Zhang Y. McIlroy J. Rordorf-Nikolic T. Orr G.A. Backer J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1379-1387Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Clearly the scale of activation of the p101/p110γ heterodimer by Gβγ in vitro indicates this “simple model” cannot apply here, however, this phenomenon lead us to test whether N-terminal tagging also influenced the sensitivity of p110γ alone to Gβγ subunits. We found that of a large range of constructs GST-p110γ alone was clearly activated by Gβγ, but only under the conditions previously reported to show this effect (15Leopoldt D. Hanck T. Exner T. Maier U. Wetzker R. Nürnberg B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7024-7029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). The very fact that Gβγ can have some significant effect on GST-p110γ in the absence of p101 may be taken to suggest one primary point of interactions of Gβγ with p101/p110γ is through direct binding to the p110γ subunit. This gains some support from work indicating Gβγ can bind to p110γ alone. We have previously found that although five times more Gβγcould be rescued from in vitro binding assays associated with p101 than with p110γ we could detect above background binding to p110γ (12Stephens L.R. Eguinoa A. Erdjument-Bromage H. Lui M. Cooke F. Coadwell J. Smrcka A.S. Thelen M. Cadwallader K. Tempst P. Hawkins P.T. Cell. 1997; 89: 105-114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Leopoldt et al. (15Leopoldt D. Hanck T. Exner T. Maier U. Wetzker R. Nürnberg B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7024-7029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar) have shown Gβγ can be recovered with p110γ immunoprecipitated from Sf9 cells, and they went on to map this binding to two distinct regions within p110γ. However, there are major problems with these approaches (15Leopoldt D. Hanck T. Exner T. Maier U. Wetzker R. Nürnberg B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7024-7029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). First, neither directly demonstrated that the Gβγ-binding sites were relevant to the activation of the PI 3-kinases and second as both analyses depended on an “immunoprecipitation wash” protocol they are subject to selective recovery of interactions with appropriate affinities and on/off rates; meaning much more physiologically important binding sites could be missed. As Gβγ are notoriously prone to nonspecific hydrophobic interaction and for binding to effectors with low affinity but high on/off rates this means these assays are of very limited value in defining the regions that bind Gβγ that lead to activation of the enzyme. As a consequence of these considerations and in the light of (i) lack of effect of Gβγ on other, non-GST-tagged p110γ constructs, (ii) the unphysiological nature of the substrate and ionic conditions required to see Gβγ activation of GST-p110γ, (iii) the inevitable problem that in using p110γ alone rather than in a complex with p101 further hydrophobic regions of protein interaction may be exposed, and (iv) that the presence of the GST fusion will drive homodimerization of p110γ, we consider the evidence that the effects of Gβγ on p101/p110γ PI 3-kinase are only via direct interaction with p110γ to be very weak. Overall, our data suggests that p101 and p110γ interact primarily through large areas covering the N and C termini of p101 and the N-terminal half of p110γ and that the areas which bind Gβγ giving the major effect on PI 3-kinase activity are probably located on p101. Given the substantial difficulties encountered in studying specific, low affinity interactions of Gβγ subunits with various effectors in vitro(e.g. studying Gβγ activation of PLCβs can be seen as an analogous problem), it is likely that a combination of further technologies, including detailed structural information, will be required to yield further insight into the mechanism of action of Gβγ on p101/p110γ PI 3-kinase. We thank Olga Perisic, Ed Walker, Christian Reid, and Roger Williams for providing Sf9 cells expressing some of the p110γ constructs. We also thank the Protein Production Unit at Onyx Pharmaceuticals for the production of all the other p101 and p110γ constructs in Sf9 cells."

Several new, clinically relevant compounds dissociate antiproliferative and calcemic activities of 1,25(OH)2D3, but the molecular basis for this has not been clearly elucidated. Here, we tested whether the potency of one class of compounds, 20-epi analogues, to induce myeloid cell differentiation, is because of direct molecular effects on vitamin D receptor (VDR). We report that two 20-epi analogues, MC1627 and MC1288, induced differentiation and transcription of p21Waf1,Cip1, a key VDR target gene involved in growth inhibition, at a concentration 100-fold lower than that of 1,25(OH)2D3. We compared this sensitivity to analogue effects on VDR interacting proteins: RXR, GRIP-1, and DRIP205, a subunit of the DRIP coactivator complex. Compared with the interaction of VDR with RXR or GRIP-1, the differentiation dose-response most closely correlated to the ligand-dependent recruitment of the DRIP coactivator complex to VDR and to the ability of the receptor to activate transcription in a cell-free system. These results provide compelling links between the efficiency of the 20-epi analogue in inducing VDR/DRIP interactions, transactivation in vitro, and its enhanced ability to induce cellular differentiation. 1,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D3(1,25(OH)2D3) plays a major role in the stimulation of bone growth, mineralization, and intestinal calcium and phosphate absorption; it also acts as a general inhibitor of cellular proliferation.

In the early part of this century, vitamin D3 was discovered as a fat-soluble substance with antirachitic activity (1Mellany E. Lancet. 1919; 2: 407-412Google Scholar). It was subsequently found that vitamin D3 must be metabolized to an active hormonal form before it can elicit its biological effects (2DeLuca H.F. Harvey Lect. 1979; 75: 333-379PubMed Google Scholar). Upon exposure to UV light, vitamin D3 is synthesized, converted in the liver to 25-hydroxyvitamin D3, and hydroxylated in the kidney to its active form, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25(OH)2D3). 1The abbreviations used are: 1,25(OH)2D3, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3; VDR, VDR, vitamin D receptor; AF-2, activation function-2; RXR, retinoid X receptor; VDRE, vitamin D-responsive element; LBD, ligand binding domain; DRIP, VDR interacting protein; DBP, vitamin D binding protein; OCT, 1,25-dihydroxy-22-oxa-vitamin D3; FACS, fluorescence-activated cell sorter; BSA, bovine serum albumin; GST, glutathione S-transferase 1The abbreviations used are: 1,25(OH)2D3, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3; VDR, VDR, vitamin D receptor; AF-2, activation function-2; RXR, retinoid X receptor; VDRE, vitamin D-responsive element; LBD, ligand binding domain; DRIP, VDR interacting protein; DBP, vitamin D binding protein; OCT, 1,25-dihydroxy-22-oxa-vitamin D3; FACS, fluorescence-activated cell sorter; BSA, bovine serum albumin; GST, glutathione S-transferase Functions of 1,25(OH)2D3 include the stimulation of bone growth and mineralization and the increase intestinal calcium and phosphate absorption. In recent years, accumulating evidence points to the involvement of 1,25(OH)2D3 in a number of diverse biological processes, including the regulation of cellular proliferation and differentiation, immunosuppression, and hormone secretion. Similar to other steroid hormones, 1,25(OH)2D3acts by binding stereospecifically to a high affinity, low capacity intracellular receptor protein, the vitamin D receptor (VDR) (3Haussler M.R. Norman A.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1969; 62: 155-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). VDR is a 48-kDa protein and is a member of the steroid/nuclear receptor superfamily that contains discrete functional domains for ligand binding, DNA binding, and transcriptional activation (4McDonnell D.P. Scott R.A. Kerner S.A. O'Malley B.W. Pike J.W. Mol. Endocrinol. 1989; 3: 635-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Transactivation by 1,25(OH)2D3 requires a carboxyl-terminal α-helical region, termed activation function-2 (AF-2), that forms part of the ligand-binding pocket (5Danielian P.S. White R. Lees J.A. Parker M.G. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1025-1033Crossref PubMed Scopus (713) Google Scholar). Upon binding to 1,25(OH)2D3, VDR dimerizes with the retinoid X receptor (RXR) to enable high affinity interactions with a specific vitamin D-responsive element (VDRE) located in 5′-flanking regions of target genes. Binding of VDR/RXR results in either the up- or down-regulation of transcription. Recent evidence has suggested that VDR exerts its transcriptional activity, at least partially, via direct interactions with TFIIB and TFIIA, proteins of the preinitiation complex (6Blanco J.C. Wang I.M. Tsai S.Y. Tsai M.J. O'Malley B.W. Jurutka P.W. Haussler M.R. Ozato K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1535-1539Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 7MacDonald P.N.

More recently, an intermediary class of proteins called coactivators was discovered that may facilitate the interaction between nuclear receptors and basal transcription machinery. To date, several coactivators have been identified by biochemical interaction or yeast two-hybrid assays (reviewed in Ref. 26Freedman L.P. Cell. 1999; 97: 5-8Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). These identified coactivators include SRC1/NCoA-1, GRIP1/TIF2/NCoA2, ACTR/p/CIP/AIB1/RAC3, and many others (8Glass C.K. Rose D.W. Rosenfeld M.G. Curr. Opin. Cell. Biol. 1997; 9: 222-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar, 9Shibata H. Spencer T.E. Onate S.A. Jenster G. Tsai S.Y. Tsai M.J. O'Malley B.W. Recent Prog. Horm.

These proteins are all related to one another, and contain a homologous leucine-rich sequence (LXXLL) that is required for their interaction with AF-2 domain of nuclear receptors in a ligand-dependent manner (11Heery D.M. Kalkhoven E. Hoare S. Parker M.G. Nature. 1997; 387: 733-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (1742) Google Scholar). Several coactivators have been shown to enhance nuclear receptor transactivation in transient transfection assays. Using an affinity column immobilizing the ligand binding domain (LBD) of VDR, we recently isolated a complex of at least 13 VDR interacting proteins (DRIPs) ranging in size from 30 to 250 kDa from Namalwa B-cell nuclear extracts (12Rachez C. Lemon B.D. Suldan Z. Bromleigh V. Gamble M. Naar A.M. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Freedman L.P. Nature. 1999; 398: 824-828Crossref PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar, 13Rachez C. Suldan Z. Ward J. Chang C.P.B. Burakov D. ErdjumentBromage H. Tempst P. Freedman L.P. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1787-1800Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). These proteins selectively bind as a complex to VDR in a 1,25(OH)2D3-dependent manner. One of these proteins, DRIP205, interacts directly with the LBD in the presence of hormone and appears to anchor the rest of the subunits to the receptor. Furthermore, the DRIP complex strongly potentiated transcription mediated by VDR/RXR in a cell-free, ligand-dependent transcription assay on chromatin-assembled templates. These observations suggested that 1,25(OH)2D3 biological effects may be mediated through the capacity of VDR to recruit the DRIP coactivator complex in response to ligand. A general effect of 1,25(OH)2D3 beyond maintaining calcium homeostasis is that of general inhibitor of cell proliferation. The antiproliferative effect of 1,25(OH)2D3 was first observed in cultured malignant melanoma cells (14Colston K. Colston M.J. Feldman D. Endocrinology. 1981; 108: 1083-1086Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar). It was also found that 1,25(OH)2D3 induced the differentiation of immature mouse myeloid leukemia cells (15Abe E. Miyaura C. Sakagami H. Takeda M. Konno K. Yamazaki T. Yoshiki S. Suda T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 4990-4994Crossref PubMed Scopus (995) Google Scholar). Anti-tumor studies of 1,25(OH)2D3 have also been extended to in vivo systems, where 1,25(OH)2D3 prolonged the survival time of mice inoculated with myeloid leukemia cells (16Honma Y. Hozumi M. Abe E. Konno K. Fukushima M. Hata S. Nishii Y. DeLuca H.F. Suda T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 201-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). Since then, 1,25(OH)2D3 has been found to inhibit the growth of a number of primary and cultured tumor cell types, including breast, prostate, colon, and lymphomas. Although these findings suggest new therapeutic possibilities for 1,25(OH)2D3 in cancer, deleterious side effects such as hypercalcemia and soft tissue calcification prevent the parent 1,25(OH)2D3 being used as a therapeutic agent. Therefore, a great deal of effort has been made to develop new vitamin D analogues to dissociate antiproliferative and calcemic activities. Ideal compounds should have potent effects in regulating cell growth and differentiation at concentrations well below those that cause side effects such as increased calcium absorption and bone mineralization. To date, several classes of vitamin D analogues with high antiproliferative and low calcemic activity have been identified, but the molecular mechanisms of their facilitated actions are poorly understood. Among them, 20-epi analogues represent a particularly noteworthy group. They are characterized by an inverted stereochemistry at carbon 20 in the side chain (Fig. 1). Their antiproliferative potency is several orders of magnitude higher than 1,25(OH)2D3, but their calcemic activity is comparable with 1,25(OH)2D3. The characterization of most 20-epi analogues has revealed that their affinity for VDR is similar to that of 1,25(OH)2D3 (17Binderup L. Latini S. Binderup E. Bretting C. Calverley M. Hansen K. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1991; 42: 1569-1575Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). In addition, the presence of vitamin D binding protein (DBP) in culture has little effect on the biological activity of 1,25(OH)2D3 or a 20-epi analogue, suggesting that the difference in cellular uptake of these ligand mediated by DBP is unlikely a major factor for the augmented activity of 20-epi compounds (18Dilworth F.J. Calverley M.J. Makin H.L. Jones G. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1994; 47: 987-993Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that conformational effects on the VDR-LBD after analogue binding dictates their potent antiproliferative effects. In electrophoretic mobility shift assays using nuclear extracts from ligand treated cells, 20-epi analogue treatment had significantly stronger effects on VDR/RXR-DNA complex formation than 1,25(OH)2D3; however, this difference was limited to lower concentrations of ligands (19Peleg S. Sastry M. Collins E.D. Bishop J.E. Norman A.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10551-10558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the difference between 1,25(OH)2D3and 20-epi compounds disappeared when using recombinant VDR and RXR proteins alone (20Ryhanen S. Jaaskelainen T. Saarela J.T. Maenpaa P.H. J. Cell. Biochem. 1998; 70: 414-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Taken together, these observations suggest that additional factors present in nuclear extracts play critical roles in 20-epi analogue-induced transactivation. Thus, it is conceivable that 20-epi analogues may induce the binding of key coactivators at lower concentrations than 1,25(OH)2D3, ultimately leading to enhanced biological activity. We demonstrate here that the binding of two 20-epi analogues, MC1288 and MC1627, result in the induction of myeloid cell differentiation and the transcriptional induction of p21Waf1, Cip1, a key VDR target gene involved in growth inhibition and differentiation (21Liu M. Lee M.H. Cohen M. Bommakanti M. Freedman L.P. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 142-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (816) Google Scholar), at picomolar doses. Compared with the interaction of VDR with RXR or coactivators such as GRIP-1, this dose-response most closely correlates to the ligand-dependent recruitment of the DRIP coactivator complex to VDR and the ability of the receptor to activate transcription in vitro. These results provide compelling links between the efficiency of the 20-epi analogues in inducing VDR/DRIP interactions, VDR-RXR transactivation in vitro, and their enhanced ability to induce cellular differentiation. 1,25(OH)2D3 and 20-epi analogues (MC1627, MC1288, and MC1292) were kindly provided by Leo Pharmaceutical Products Ltd. (Denmark). 1,25-dihydroxy-22-oxa-vitamin D3 (OCT) was generously provided by Chugai Pharmaceuticals (Japan). Namalwa cells (ATCC) were cultured in 4-liter spinner flasks and maintained in RPMI medium supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum, 5% calf serum, and 300 μg/ml glutamine. Nuclear extracts were prepared by the method described by Dignam et al. (22Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9132) Google Scholar). U937 cells (ATCC) were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 300 μg/ml glutamine. Early log-phase growing U937 cells were treated with tested ligands ranging from 10−9 to 10−13m or ethanol for 72 h. Approximately 2 × 106 cells were harvested, followed by washing twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA). Cell pellets were then resuspended in 250 μl of phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% BSA. 2 μl of fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated CD14 and 2 μl of phycoerythrin-conjugated CD11b (Caltag) were added to 75 μl of each sample; an isotype-matched antibody was incubated with 75 μl of each sample as a control for nonspecific binding. Cells were incubated in the dark on ice for 45 min. After washing twice, cells were resuspended in 0.5 ml of phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% BSA. Stained cells were analyzed by a FACS (Becton Dickinson). Approximately 107 U937 cells were collected, washed twice and resuspended in 400 μl of RPMI 1640. Cells were then transiently cotransfected with 10 μg of WWP-Luc (p21), 2 μg of pCMV-hVDR, and 8 μg of carrier plasmid (pOTCO) by electroporation in a 4-mm cuvette. Transfected cells were pooled together, evenly distributed to 100-mm plates, and treated with tested ligands ranging from 10−8 to 10−12m or ethanol for 24 h. Treated cells were harvested and lysed. Cellular extracts were assayed for luciferase activity by dilution in cell culture lysis reagent (Promega) and measurement in 100 μl of luciferase assay reagent (Promega) in a luminometer. For GST-VDR LBD and DRIP complex interactions, 40 μg of GST-VDR LBD-(110–427) fusion proteins immobilized on beads were incubated with 10−8m tested ligands in GST-binding buffer (20 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.9), 180 mm KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm dithiothreitol) containing 1 mg/ml BSA for 2 h. GST fusion proteins were incubated with approximately 1 mg of Namalwa nuclear extracts containing 200 mm KCl in the presence of 10−8m tested ligands or ethanol for 12 h. Bound proteins were washed six times with 1 ml of washing buffer (GST-binding buffer containing 0.1% Nonidet P-40) and eluted by incubation with GST-binding buffer containing 0.1% Nonidet P-40 and 0.15% SarkosylTM (Sigma) at 4 °C for 20 min. Eluted proteins were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and visualized by silver nitrate staining. For GST-DRIP205/VDR, GST-RXRα/VDR, or GST-GRIP-1/VDR interaction assays, 15 μg of fusion proteins immobilized on beads were incubated with GST-binding buffer containing 3.5 mg/ml BSA at 4 °C for 2 h. GST fusion proteins were then incubated with purified recombinant VDR in the presence of tested ligands ranging from 10−8 to 10−12m at 4 °C for 2 h. After washing three times, samples were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, followed by transferring on polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and detected for VDR binding by Western blotting. Transcription assays were performed as described previously (23Lemon B.D. Fondell J.D. Freedman L.P. Mol. Cell Biol. 1997; 17: 1923-1937Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) with the following modifications: 20 μl of each receptor incubation mix including 180 ng of recombinant VDR and RXR plus tested ligands ranging from 10−8 to 10−12m or ethanol was incubated on ice for 45 min. The volume of receptor-ligand mix was 3 μl instead of the 10 μl used in previous assays (23Lemon B.D. Fondell J.D. Freedman L.P. Mol. Cell Biol. 1997; 17: 1923-1937Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), and the volume of nuclear extract was increased to 15 μl from 8 μl so that the final reaction volume was 25 μl, as described previously. To examine how vitamin D analogues might influence VDR transcriptional activation, we first sought those analogues that had very potent effects on a biological process which could then be correlated to a transcriptional response. To do so, we chose to examine vitamin D3-induced myeloid cell differentiation, whereby myelomonoblastic cell lines, such as U937, induce to differentiate to monocyte/macrophages upon exposure to 1,25(OH)2D3 (24Olsson I. Gullberg U. Ivhed I. Nilsson K. Cancer Res. 1983; 43: 5862-5867PubMed Google Scholar). The degree of differentiation can be quantitated by FACS by assaying the expression of macrophage-specific markers on the cell surface, such as CD11b and CD14. When U937 cells were treated for 72 h with 1,25(OH)2D3 at concentrations ranging from 10−13 to 10−9m, FACS analyses indicated that concentrations of 10−10m1,25(OH)2D3 were sufficient to induce differentiation while concentrations above 10−9m had no greater effect (Fig.2, A and B). In contrast, when cells were treated with two related analogues of vitamin D belonging to the 20-epi group, MC1288 and MC1627, detectable CD11b and CD14 levels were apparent at 10−12m, fully two orders of magnitude less than 1,25(OH)2D3 (Fig. 2, C andD). Maximal CD14 and CD11b expression was detected with MC1627 at 10−11m; at this concentration, no effect on U937 differentiation was measurable with 1,25(OH)2D3. We next asked if the effects of these potent analogues on myeloid differentiation correlated to VDR-mediated activation of transcription of a relevant target gene. Previously, we identified the p21Waf1,Cip1 gene among a set of several primary response genes that are transcriptional targets of VDR following addition of 1,25(OH)2D3 to U937 cells (21Liu M. Lee M.H. Cohen M. Bommakanti M. Freedman L.P. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 142-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (816) Google Scholar). As we observed before, treatment of U937 cells by 1,25(OH)2D3 resulted in a 5- to 10-fold induction of p21 transcription at 10−9m (Fig.3). In contrast, significantly lower amounts of MC1627 and MC1288 were required to elicit strong p21 induction. A 6-fold induction was apparent at 10−11m of MC1288, and MC1627 and peak inductions of 15- to 20-fold were measured at 10−10m with MC1288 and MC1627, respectively (Fig. 3). No induction of p21 transcription was discernible at 10−10m1,25(OH)2D3. The hormone and analogue effects on p21 transcription correlated remarkably closely to the differentiation responsiveness of U937 cells. Thus, the dose-response of the 20-epi analogues on myeloid cell differentiation mirrors p21 transcriptional activation, further linking differentiation and the expression of this cell cycle inhibitor (21Liu M. Lee M.H. Cohen M. Bommakanti M. Freedman L.P. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 142-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (816) Google Scholar). Because of the astonishingly potent effects the 20-epi compounds had on p21 induction and myeloid cell differentiation, we wished to determine whether their activity could be correlated with an enhancement of known VDR-protein interactions that are functionally important. Such interactions would include, for example, VDR-coactivator binding or ligand-stimulated dimerization. An obligatory cofactor for VDR transactivation is its heterodimeric partner, RXR. We previously reported that three analogues containing 16-ene-23-yne-D3 substitutions conferred distinct rate and equilibrium constants for VDR-RXR heterodimerization and specific DNA binding to a VDRE relative to the natural 1,25(OH)2D3 ligand (25Cheskis B. Lemon B.D. Uskokovic M. Lomedico P. Freedman L.P. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 1814-1824Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Here, we have used a glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion to RXR to performin vitro pull-down assays with purified VDR in the presence of 1,25(OH)2D3 or the two 20-epi analogues. When compared with the natural ligand, MC1627 was able to stimulate VDR/RXR heterodimerization at a lower dose (10−11m), whereas MC1288 did not differ significantly from 1,25(OH)2D3 (Fig.4). At 10−10m, a greater stimulation of heterodimerization was observed with both analogues than with 1,25(OH)2D3 (Fig. 4). Thus, although we cannot rule out a contribution of the 20-epi compounds on VDR-RXR heterodimerization, the effects of the analogues on dimerization per se do not appear to mirror the same dose-response as observed in the differentiation and p21 transactivation assays. Recruitment of transcriptional coactivators by VDR is also regulated by VDR ligands. Such coactivators include SRC1/NCoA-1, GRIP1/TIF2/NCoA2, ACTR/p/CIP/AIB1/RAC3, P/CAF, and CBP/p300. Several of these coactivators (i.e. the p160 family) are structurally related and have been shown to possess histone acetyl transferase activity. To test the effect the 20-epi analogues had on the interaction between VDR and members of the p160 family, we assessed GRIP-1/VDR interactions as an example using a GST pull-down assay. As shown in Fig.5, MC1627 but not MC1288 was more effective than 1,25(OH)2D3 at lower concentrations in inducing the GRIP/VDR interaction (Fig. 5). The concentrations required for inducing 50% of maximal VDR/GRIP-1 interaction were 5.9 × 10−10, 4.7 × 10−10, and 4 × 10−11 for 1,25(OH)2D3, MC1288, and MC1627, respectively. The difference between 1,25(OH)2D3 and MC1627 is approximately 1 log (Fig. 5 B and Table I) and does not correlate with the 2 log difference observed using U937 differentiation or p21 transactivation as a readout. Therefore, it is not likely that the increased effect these analogues have on VDR activity is because of a direct role in the GRIP-1/VDR induction.Table IEffective dose required for 50% maximal VDR/coactivator interaction (ED50)AnalogueDRIP 205GRIP-1m1,25(OH)2D37.0 × 10−105.9 × 10−10MC16273.0 × 10−124.0 × 10−11MC12887.0 × 10−124.7 × 10−10MC12922.2 × 10−10OCT8.0 × 10−10 Open table in a new tab Because the 20-epi analogues did modulate GRIP-1/VDR binding somewhat, we considered whether they might affect binding between VDR and other coactivators. The DRIPs comprise a multiprotein coactivator complex of at least thirteen subunits that we recently discovered and have been characterizing that bind to VDR and other nuclear receptors in a strictly ligand-dependent manner (12Rachez C. Lemon B.D. Suldan Z. Bromleigh V. Gamble M. Naar A.M. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Freedman L.P. Nature. 1999; 398: 824-828Crossref PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar, 13Rachez C. Suldan Z. Ward J. Chang C.P.B. Burakov D. ErdjumentBromage H. Tempst P. Freedman L.P. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1787-1800Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). The DRIP complex lacks histone acetyl transferase activity, and its individual subunits do not share any homology to other characterized coactivators (12Rachez C. Lemon B.D. Suldan Z. Bromleigh V. Gamble M. Naar A.M. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Freedman L.P. Nature. 1999; 398: 824-828Crossref PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar). A single subunit, DRIP205, directly associates with VDR via its ligand-binding domain. This association is dependent on the AF-2 subdomain of the receptor and one of two LXXLL (NR) motifs in the central portion of DRIP205 (residues 630–635). To see whether the 20-epi analogues affected the DRIP205/VDR interaction, we employed a GST fusion protein containing the nuclear receptor interaction domain of DRIP205 to pull-down purified VDR in the presence of 1,25(OH)2D3 or the 20-epi compounds at concentrations ranging from 10−12 to 10−6m. The results shown in Fig.6A illustrate that 1,25(OH)2D3 induced the association of VDR and DRIP205 in a dose-dependent manner, beginning at 10−10m. MC1627 and MC1288 exhibited significantly more potent effects on VDR/DRIP205 interactions than the natural ligand. The minimum concentration required for inducing the VDR/DRIP205 association was 10−12m, at least 100 times lower than that of 1,25(OH)2D3 (Fig.6, A and B and TableI). We also tested two additional vitamin D compounds for their effects on VDR/DRIP205 interaction. MC1292, which, relative to other 20-epi compounds, induces a distinct conformation in the VDR-LBD, as indicated by protease digestion patterns, 2L. Binderup, personal communication. and confers a relatively low antiproliferative activity (only 4-fold higher than 1,25(OH)2D3) (17Binderup L. Latini S. Binderup E. Bretting C. Calverley M. Hansen K. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1991; 42: 1569-1575Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar), here showed a similar VDR/DRIP binding pattern as 1,25(OH)2D3. Similarly, a chemically distinct vitamin D3 analogue, OCT, conferred weaker ability to induce the VDR-DRIP205 interaction than the 20-epi compounds and even 1,25(OH)2D3 (Fig. 6,A and B and Table I), suggesting that the biological effects of the 20-epi analogues may occur selectively through VDR/DRIP recruitment. Taking together all the data from Figs.Figure 4, Figure 5, Figure 6, it appears that the most potent effects of the 20-epi analogues on VDR-cofactor interactions occur between the receptor and DRIP205. This observation suggests that the DRIP complex is the preferred VDR coactivator complex, at least in response to the 20-epi analogues. The VDR-DRIP205 results suggested that the ability of vitamin D analogues to induce VDR-DRIP binding might correlate with their effects on VDR-mediated transactivation, since we have previously found that the addition of the DRIP coactivator complex to a purified transcription system strongly potentiated VDR-RXR transactivation in response to 1,25(OH)2D3 (12Rachez C. Lemon B.D. Suldan Z. Bromleigh V. Gamble M. Naar A.M. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Freedman L.P. Nature. 1999; 398: 824-828Crossref PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar). Because the 20-epi compounds conferred the most potent effect on VDR-DRIP205 binding, and DRIP205 anchors the entire complex to VDR, we chose to focus our efforts on this class of vitamin D analogues. As expected, MC1288 and MC1627 were able to stimulate a stronger degree of recruitment of several subunits of the DRIP coactivator complex than 1,25(OH)2D3 at 10−8m(Fig. 7 A). In particular, the binding to VDR of DRIP250, 240, 205, 100, and 97 were enhanced by the 20-epi compounds relative to 1,25(OH)2D3. To directly link VDR/DRIP binding in response to analogue dose to transcriptional activity, we repeated the 20-epi analogue titration using a cell-free, VDR-RXR-responsive transcription assay. This allowed us to monitor VDR transcriptional enhancement as a consequence of analogue potency without the confounding effects that cellular uptake or metabolism of the compounds might have on the biological readout. With the natural ligand, activation by VDR-RXR above basal levels was weakly detectable at 10−9m and reproducibly strong at 10−8m (Fig. 7, B andC). As was the case with both the VDR/DRIP205 and VDR/DRIP complex interactions, the two 20-epi compounds showed a stronger transactivation by VDR-RXR in vitro at both of these concentrations; moreover, some analogue-stimulated transcription could be observed as low as 10−10m (Fig.7 B). These results provide a strong correlation between the proclivity of the 20-epi analogues to recruit the DRIP complex and their ability to stimulate VDR-RXR transactivation in vitroat lower concentrations than 1,25(OH)2D3. The promising therapeutic potential of vitamin D3 has stimulated interest in developing similar vitamin D compounds for a variety of clinical applications. Although several classes of analogues with high antiproliferative but low calcemic activities have been identified, the mechanisms by which these analogues possess potent effects in regulating cell proliferation and differentiation are poorly understood. In particular, whether these compounds work indirectly via pharmacokinetic phenomena or through direct conformational changes on VDR is still a matter for debate. It is certainly reasonable to assume that either mechanism is not mutually exclusive, in that different classes of compounds act through either route. 20-epi analogues were identified initially as potent inhibitors of cell proliferation. Because previous characterization of this particular group has suggested that their intrinsic binding affinities for VDR and DBP do not differ from those of the natural ligand (17Binderup L. Latini S. Binderup E. Bretting C. Calverley M. Hansen K. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1991; 42: 1569-1575Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar, 18Dilworth F.J. Calverley M.J. Makin H.L. Jones G. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1994; 47: 987-993Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), 20-epi compounds represent a class of compounds that might instead act by affecting VDR structure, which in turn would somehow lead to enhanced VDR function and biological activity. Previous studies using nuclear extracts prepared from ligand-treated cells indicated that 20-epi analogues at low concentrations have much stronger effects on VDR/RXR-DNA complex formation than 1,25(OH)2D3(19Peleg S. Sastry M. Collins E.D. Bishop J.E. Norman A.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10551-10558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). However, these results could not be duplicated in a cell-free system with recombinant VDR and RXR alone (20Ryhanen S. Jaaskelainen T. Saarela J.T. Maenpaa P.H. J. Cell. Biochem. 1998; 70: 414-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). We performed pull-down assays with purified RXR and VDR to examine the ligand effect on VDR/RXR dimerization and found little or no difference between 1,25(OH)2D3 and 20-epi analogues at low concentrations. 20-epi analogues are therefore unlikely to affect VDR-mediated transactivation through enhanced VDR/RXR dimerization; instead, these analogues appear to increase the biological activity of VDR by inducing receptor interaction with coactivators present in nuclear extracts that are important for VDR-mediated transactivation, such as p160 family members, like GRIP-1, or, more potently, DRIP205, the subunit bridging the interaction of VDR with the multi-protein DRIP complex. The dose-response patterns of DRIP recruitment by VDR in response to MC1627 and MC1288 were remarkably similar to the induction of U937 cell differentiation and p21 transactivation at the same low concentrations of these compounds. That these cellular responses to the analogues are occurring through the ability of VDR to regulate transcription is closely correlated to the ability of the 20-epi analogues to induce VDR-RXR-dependent transactivation in a cell-free, in vitro transcription system at concentrations (i.e. 10−10m) at least 100-fold lower than the minimum concentration required for 1,25(OH)2D3 induction (Fig. 7). To our knowledge, this is the first direct demonstration that vitamin D analogues can act directly at the level of gene transcription and provides the best evidence to date that some classes of analogues can influence biological readouts directly through VDR-dependent transactivation. In agreement with our results, the reported IC50 for inhibition of cell proliferation by the 20-epi analogues correlates with their ED50 for VDR/DRIP 205 interaction. For example, IC50 values for 1,25(OH)2D3, MC1288, and MC1292 are 1.4 × 10−8, 2.8 × 10−10, and 3.4 × 10−9, respectively (17Binderup L. Latini S. Binderup E. Bretting C. Calverley M. Hansen K. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1991; 42: 1569-1575Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar); and their ED50 values are 7 × 10−10, 7 × 10−12, and 2.2 × 10−10, respectively (Table I). Among nine vitamin D analogues we tested, the strongest effects on VDR/DRIP205 interaction were limited to three 20-epi analogues. Although some ligands such as OCT possess potent antiproliferative effects, they show similar or even weaker effects on DRIP 205 binding to VDR as 1,25(OH)2D3, indicating that multiple mechanisms may account for the biological activities of different ligands. One possibility is that pharmacokinetic phenomena may lead to their altered activities. For example, the affinity of OCT for DBP is 580-fold lower than that of 1,25(OH)2D3 (28Nishii Y. Abe J. Sato K. Kobayashi T. Okano T. Tsugawa N. Slatoposki E. Brown A.J. Dusso A.D. Raisz A.G. Norman A.W. Bouillon R. Thomasset M. Vitamin D: Gene Regulation, Structure-Function Analysis and Clinical Applications. de Gruyter, New York1991: 289-297Crossref Google Scholar). Lower affinity for DBP may increase cellular uptake and thus activity in target cells. A second possibility is that the existence of multiple VDR coactivators may allow target cells to respond to different stimuli in a more specific manner. Besides the DRIP complex, other coactivators, such as SRC-1, TIF-2/GRIP-1, and AIB1/ACTR have also been found to interact with the VDR-LBD and enhance VDR-mediated transcription in transfection assays. For example, it has been reported that OCT selectively induces VDR to interact with TIF2 but not with SRC-1 or AIB1/ACTR (29Takeyama K.I. Masuhiro Y. Fuse H. Endoh H. Murayama A. Kitanaka S. Suzawa M. Yanagisawa J. Kato S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1049-1055Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). How do different analogues confer differential effects on VDR activity? The most likely explanation is that distinct classes of analogues induce different LBD conformations, which in turn might be selective for particular kinds of coactivators. Several recent LBD crystal structures have established that upon ligand binding, the AF-2 helix (helix 12) undergoes a major reorientation in the context of the overall LBD structure, forming part of a charged clamp that accommodates the binding of coactivators (30Nolte R.T. Wisely G.B. Westin S. Cobb J.E. Lambert M.H. Kurokawa R. Rosenfeld M.G. Willson T.M. Glass C.K. Milburn M.V. Nature. 1998; 395: 137-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (1645) Google Scholar, 31Bourguet W. Ruff M. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H. Moras D. Nature. 1995; 375: 377-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (1042) Google Scholar) Moreover, the crystal structure of the rat α1 thyroid hormone receptor LBD in complex with a thyroid hormone agonist indicates that the AF-2 domain contributes to hormone binding, suggesting a structural role for ligand in forming the active conformation of the LBD (32Wagner R.L. Apriletti J.W. McGrath M.E. West B.L. Baxter J.D. Fletterick R.J. Nature. 1995; 378: 690-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (802) Google Scholar). In contrast, estrogen antagonists such as tamoxifen and raloxifene appear to alter the position of the AF-2 helix such that helix 12 occupies space in the LBD in a similar manner as has been described for SRC-1, thereby precluding coactivator binding (27Brzozowski A.M.

Alterations in VDR structure in response to the 20-epi compounds might result in a conformation that preferentially accommodates DRIP205 (and therefore the entire DRIP complex) over other coactivators, such as SRC-1 or GRIP-1. Differential effects on VDR-LBD structure by analogues relative to 1,25(OH)2D3is consistent with the observations that the binding of 1,25(OH)2D3 versus 20-epi analogues result in unique ligand-dependent VDR sensitivities to proteases. When liganded VDR was treated with trypsin or chymotrypsin, 20-epi analog-VDR complexes showed digestion patterns significantly different from the 1,25(OH)2D3-VDR complex, indicating the intrinsic alterations in LBD conformation induced by 1,25(OH)2D3 versus 20-epi analogues (19Peleg S.

Differential preferences for coactivators may not be surprising, given that GRIP-1 is structurally unrelated to DRIP205, except the requirement of one of two LXXLL motifs for interaction with the LBD (26Freedman L.P. Cell. 1999; 97: 5-8Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). Moreover, while an intact AF-2 core is essential for VDR/DRIP binding, the details of these contacts must be different from that for VDR/SRC-1. The glutamate residue at position 420 of VDR is critical for SRC-1 binding but not for DRIP binding, reflecting subtle but perhaps key differences between the mode of interactions of these two coactivators with the LBD (13Rachez C.

In summary, our findings suggest that the DRIP complex, and most likely other coactivators, play a central role in ligand-dependent, VDR-mediated transcription which in turn is reflected in key biological responses, such as anti-proliferation and differentiation. The strong correlation between VDR/DRIP interactions and cellular responses to vitamin D analogues might be valuable in developing high throughput methodologies for discovering new lead vitamin D compounds that possess highly potent anti-proliferative activities.

This can be inhibited by pretreatment with IL-13 via a phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase-dependent mechanism (Wright, K., Ward, S. G., Kolios, G., and Westwick, J. (1997)J. Biol. Chem. 272, 12626–12633). Since NO has been implicated in regulating mechanisms leading to cell death, while activation of PI 3-kinase-dependent signaling cascades are thought to be involved with promoting cell survival events, we have investigated the outcome of these cytokine treatments on apoptosis and cell survival of HT-29 cells. Initiation of apoptosis can be achieved by the combinations of IFN-γ/TNF-α, IFN-γ/CD95, IL-1α/IFN-γ, and IL-1α/IFN-γ/TNF-α to varying extents. Induction of apoptotic markers by HT-29 cells in response to cytokine treatment is not dependent on NO production. Pretreatment with IL-13 protects against IL-1α/IFN-γ/TNF-α- and IFN-γ/TNF-α- as well as IFN-γ/CD95-induced (but not IL-1α/IFN-γ-induced) cell death. In addition, IFN-γ/TNF-α and IL-1α/IFN-γ/TNF-α stimulate activation of caspase-8 and caspase-3, which IL-13 pretreatment was able to partially inhibit and delay. IL-13 also stimulates activation of the major PI 3-kinase effector, protein kinase B. The PI 3-kinase inhibitors wortmannin and LY294002 inhibit IL-13 stimulation of protein kinase B as well as the cell survival effects of IL-13. These data demonstrate that cytokine-induced apoptosis of HT-29 cells is NO-independent and that the activation of a PI 3-kinase-dependent signaling cascade by IL-13 is a key signal responsible for the inhibition of apoptosis.

In lipopolysaccharide-stimulated monocytes, IL-13 also acts as a suppresser of proinflammatory cytokines (e.g. TNF type α, IL-1, and IL-6), chemokines (e.g. IL-8 and macrophage inflammatory protein-1α), and hematopoietic growth factors (e.g. granulocyte/macrophage-colony stimulating factor and granulocyte-colony stimulating factor) expression by activated monocytes/macrophages or endothelial cells (1Minty A.

Activation of the signaling enzyme phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase) by IL-13 is important for mediating these effects (8Kolios G. Wright K.L. Jordan N.J. Leithead J.B. Robertson D.A.F.

Reed J.C. Smeland E.B. Blood. 1997; 89: 4415-4424Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, the related cytokine, IL-4, also enhances cell survival (15Zamorano J. Wang H.Y. Wang L.-M. Pierce J.H. Keegan A.D. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 4926-4934PubMed Google Scholar) and this correlates well with observations that both IL-13 and IL-4 stimulate PI 3-kinase (10Wright K. Ward S.G. Kolios G.

We have previously shown that a combination of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1α/IFN-γ/TNF-α) up-regulates iNOS expression and generates NO in a human colonic epithelial cell line HT-29 (20Kolios G. Brown Z. Robson R.L. Robertson D.A.F. Westwick J. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1995; 116: 2866-2872Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Also, it has recently been shown that IFN-γ, in combination with TNF-α or anti-CD95, induces apoptosis in HT-29 cells (21Abreu-Martin M.T. Vidrich A. Lynch D.H. Targan S.R. J. Immunol. 1998; 155: 4147-4154Google Scholar) and an increased frequency of epithelial apoptosis mediated by the CD95-CD95L system is seen in ulcerative colitis (22Sträter J. Wellisch I. Riedl S.

However, colonic epithelial cell injury, resulting in impaired barrier function, could contribute to the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (24Gardiner K.R. Anderson N.H. Rowlands B.J. Barbul A. Gut. 1998; 37: 530-535Crossref Scopus (60) Google Scholar). It has been postulated that overproduction of nitric oxide (NO) by inflamed mucosa may play a role in the pathophysiology of inflammatory bowel disease due to the increased expression of the inducible form of nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) found in biopsies taken from patients with active ulcerative colitis as compared with normal colon (9Kolios G. Rooney N. Murphy C.T. Robertson D.A.F. Westwick J. Gut. 1998; 43: 56-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The production of NO might play a critical role in the resolution of inflammation (25McCafferty D.M. Mudgett J.S. Swain M.G. Kubes P.

Clin.

In this study, we sought to ascertain whether there is a relationship between NO production and apoptosis of HT-29 epithelial cells observed in response to a combination of cytokines and/or CD95 ligation. In addition, given that the ability of IL-13 to inhibit iNOS expression and NO generation in this system is driven by PI 3-kinase-dependent pathway, we investigated whether IL-13 could provide a cell survival signal through PI 3-kinase to protect against cytokine-driven apoptotic signals. Human recombinant IL-13 was purified from culture supernatants of stable transfected CHO cells (1Minty A. Chalon P. Derocq J.M. Dumont X. Guillemot J.C. Kaghad M. Labit C. Leplatois P. Liauzun P.

Human recombinant IL-1α (specific activity, 5 × 107 units/mg) and TNF-α (specific activity, 6 × 107 units/mg) were generous gifts from Glaxo-Wellcome (Stevenage, United Kingdom) and Bayer (Slough, UK), respectively. Human recombinant IFN-γ (specific activity, > 2.0 × 107units/mg) and histone H2B was purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Anti-human Fas monoclonal antibody (IgM CH11 clone) was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology. PKBα polyclonal Ab was from Brian Hemmings (Friedrich Miescher-Institute, Basel, Switzerland). 2,3-Diaminonaphthalene was purchased from Lancaster Synthesis Ltd. LY294002 (2-(4-morpholinyl)-8-phenyl-4H-1-benzopyran-4-one) was purchased from Affiniti (Exeter, UK), Z-VAD-FMK was purchased from Calbiochem (Nottingham, UK), and [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol) was purchased from DuPont NEN, UK. All other reagents were from Sigma (Poole, UK). The human colonic epithelial carcinoma cell line HT-29 was obtained from the European Collection of Animal Cell Cultures. Cells were cultured in humidified incubators at 37 °C, 5% CO2 in McCoy's 5A medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 10 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin, and 10 μg/ml fungizone. The cells were passaged weekly and, for experiments, HT-29 cells were aliquoted into 96-well plates (104 cells/well) and allowed to adhere overnight prior to cytokine stimulation in medium without serum. The detection of apoptosis was performed by determining the histone-associated DNA fragments (mono- and oligonucleosomes) generated by the apoptotic cells using the photometric cell death detection ELISAPLUS (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Briefly, 104 cells/well were aliquoted into 96-well plates and allowed to adhere overnight. Cells were then treated and pelleted as indicated, the supernatants were removed and the cell pellets were lysed and assayed according to the manufacturer's instructions. Photometric analysis, with 2,2′-azino-di-(3-ethylbenzathiazoline sulfonate) as the substrate, was performed using a microtiter plate-reader (Dynatech MR5000). The specific enrichment of mono- and oligonucleosomes released into the cytoplasm was calculated using the following formula, milliunits of the sample(dying/dead cells)milliunits of the corresponding control untreated cells=enrichment factor(milliunit=absorbance(10−3))Equation 1 Alternatively, apoptosis was determined by direct fluorescence detection of end-labeled genomic DNA using the “Oncor Apoptag DirectIn Situ Apoptosis Detection Kit Fluorescein” (Appligene, Durham, UK). Treated and untreated cells were spun onto slides, fixed, and stained according to the manufacturer's instructions. The slides were observed under a fluorescence microscope. The results were scored by counting apoptotic cells (green) and viable cells (red) randomly in various fields. For each condition, 500 to 1000 cells were counted. In some experiments, apoptosis was detected by measuring the externalization of phosphatidylserine by fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled annexin V binding using the Apoptosis Detection Kit (R&D Systems, Abingdon, UK). Cells were treated as indicated in the figure legends and stained according to the manufacturers instructions before analysis by flow cytometry (Becton Dickinson FACS Vantage). Percent increases in annexin V fluorescein binding above controls were measured. NO production by HT-29 cells was determined by measuring the stable end-product nitrite in the cell culture supernatants by fluorometric assay which is based upon the reaction of nitrite with 2,3-diaminonaphthalene to form the fluorescent product 1-(H)-naphthotriazole as described previously (10Wright K.

Inc., Temecula, CA) are based on spectrophotometric detection of the chromophorep-nitroanilide (pNA) after cleavage from the labeled substrate DEVD-pNA. Briefly, 3 × 106cells/well were aliquoted into 96-well plates and allowed to adhere overnight. Cells were then treated as indicated and pelleted after 24 h to include any floating cells. The supernatants were removed and the cell pellets were lysed and assayed according to the manufacturers instructions. After a 2-h incubation with DEVD-pNA substrate, the pNA light emission was quantified using a microtiter plate reader at 405 nm. Comparison of the absorbance of pNA from the apoptotic sample with uninduced control determined the fold increase in caspase activity. 107 cells/ml were stimulated and incubated at 37 °C in McCoys as indicated. Reactions were terminated by the addition of 1 ml of ice-cold lysis buffer (1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris pH 7.5, 5 mm EDTA, 10 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, and 1 mm sodium molybdate). Lysates were incubated at 4 °C for 15 min, followed by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm. Aliquots of cell lysate supernatant were boiled in Laemmli buffer and electrophoresed through 12.5% (v/v) acrylamide gels (with an acrylamide:bis-acrylamide ratio of 37.5:1) by SDS-PAGE and the proteins were transferred by electroblotting onto nitrocellulose (Schleicher & Schuell) as described previously (10Wright K.

The blots were probed with a phosphospecific PKB antibody (0.5 μg/ml) which only has affinity for the active,473Ser-phosphorylated forms of PKB (New England BioLabs) and proteins visualized by ECL with a goat anti-rabbit Ig (0.1 μg/ml) conjugated with horseradish peroxidase as a secondary antibody. Where appropriate, blots were completely stripped of antibodies by incubation at 55 °C for 60 min with stripping solution (62.5 mmTris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% (w/v) SDS, 100 mm 2-mercaptoethanol). After extensive washing, blots were reblocked prior to reprobing with anti-PKB antibody (0.5 μg/ml) (New England Biolabs). Alternatively, cells were stimulated as described above and PKBα was immunoprecipitated from cell lysates with 1 μg of anti-PKB (Santa Cruz) and assayed for in vitro kinase activity using histone H2B as a substrate as described previously (40Parry R.

After addition of 30 μl of protein G-Sepharose beads (50% suspension in phosphate-buffered saline), immunoprecipitates were rotated for 1 h at 4 °C and then washed three times in lysis buffer, resuspended in Laemmli buffer, and boiled for 5 min prior to electrophoresis through 12.5% (v:v) acrylamide gels (with an acrylamide:bis-acrylamide ratio of 118:1) by SDS-PAGE.

Chem. 1997; 272: 12626-12633Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 39Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). Bad was immunoblotted with 0.5 μg/ml anti-Bad polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz) and proteins visualized by a chemiluminescence detection system (ECL, Amersham, UK) with a goat anti-rabbit Ig (0.1 μg/ml) conjugated with horseradish peroxidase as a secondary antibody (DAKO). Growth-arrested HT-29 monolayers stimulated with a combination of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1α (10 ng/ml), IFN-γ (300 units/ml)), and TNF-α (100 ng/ml) result in a 25–80% increase in the expression of apoptotic markers, as assessed by a number of assays which measure early and late stage markers of apoptotic events (namely externalization of phosphatidylserine, DNA fragmentation, and DNA-histone association), over a time course of 4–24 h (Table Iand Fig. 1). In contrast, treatment with individual cytokines was insufficient to increase cell death above basal levels (Table I). Pretreatment of the HT-29 cells with the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-13 (30 ng/ml) markedly inhibited apoptotic events stimulated by the pro-inflammatory cytokines (Table Iand Fig. 1). These experiments indicate that IL-13 consistently inhibited the induction of apoptotic markers in cells treated with the combined stimuli of IL-1α/IFN-γ/TNF-α by 50–65%. Treatment of HT-29 cells for 24 h with IL-13 had no effect on the level of expression of TNF receptor-1 as assessed by flow cytometry using a receptor-specific Ab, thus confirming previous observations (41Manna S.K. Aggarwal B.B. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 2863-2872PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, flow cytometry using appropriate receptor Abs also revealed that IL-13 had no effect on the levels of expression of IL-1 receptor (type-1) or IFN-γ receptor (data not shown), indicating that down-regulation of receptor expression cannot account for the observed reduction in cell death.Table IIL-13 protects against IL-1α/IFN-γ/TNF-α-induced apoptosis of HT-29 cellsPercentage cells presenting apoptotic markers (%)Annexin VApoptag8 h12 h24 h48 hControl3.1 ± 0.95.2 ± 0.97.1 ± 0.713.4 ± 1.1IL-1α2.8 ± 0.34.8 ± 0.77.8 ± 1.614.2 ± 0.8IFN-γ3.3 ± 0.95.6 ± 1.49.2 ± 0.814.7 ± 1.7TNF-α4.1 ± 0.87.8 ± 0.310.1 ± 1.616.1 ± 2.3IL1α/IFNγ/TNFα24.3ap ≤ 0.01. ± 1.232.3ap ≤ 0.01. ± 0.261.3ap ≤ 0.01. ± 1.481.2ap ≤ 0.01. ± 1.1IL-13 + IL1α/ IFNγ/TNFα11.2bp ≤ 0.05. ± 1.119.2bp ≤ 0.05. ± 0.236.7bp ≤ 0.05. ± 0.955.6bp ≤ 0.05. ± 2.0Growth arrested monolayers of HT-29 cells were either left untreated or treated with 30 ng/ml IL-13 for 1 h.

Ligation of CD95 (Fas/APO-1), which is a member of the TNF receptor superfamily, is associated with the induction of apoptosis in several cell types (42Nagata S. Cell. 1997; 88: 355-365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4561) Google Scholar) and flow cytometry has revealed the presence of CD95 on HT-29 cells used in this study (data not shown). We therefore performed experiments to investigate whether or not CD95 ligation stimulates apoptosis of HT-29 cells. In this respect, ligation of CD95 with the antibody CH11 did not induce apoptosis above control basal levels (Fig.2). However, treatment of HT-29 cells with IFN-γ in combination with the anti-CD95 mAb CH11, induced an approximate 9-fold increase in DNA fragmentation over 24 h, which was comparable to the apoptosis induced by IFN-γ and TNF-α (Fig.2). By contrast, the minimum cytokine combination for the induction of iNOS and NO generation, namely IL-1α/IFN-γ (20Kolios G. Brown Z. Robson R.L. Robertson D.A.F. Westwick J. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1995; 116: 2866-2872Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), induced only a 5-fold increase in DNA fragmentation above basal levels. Preincubation with IL-13 again reduced the prevalence of apoptotic markers induced by IFNγ/CH11 and IFN-γ/TNF-α by approximately 50%, but did not inhibit apoptosis driven by IL-1α/IFN-γ (Fig. 2). Several studies have demonstrated that nitric oxide regulates apoptosis in a number of settings (reviewed in Ref.43Brüne B. Von Knethen A. Sandau K.B. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1998; 351: 261-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). Given that concentrations of IL-1α/IFN-γ/TNF-α that are known to induce iNOS expression and that NO production can also stimulate apoptosis, we considered the possibility that this apoptotic response may be NO-dependent. To investigate this possibility we pretreated HT-29 cells with the iNOS inhibitor 500 μm aminoguanidine, which markedly inhibited the concentration of nitrite generated by IL-1α/IFN-γ/TNF-α (although less inhibition was observed with the minimum combination of IL-1α/IFN-γ) over 24 h (Fig.3 A), but had no effect on the apoptotic signals provided by combinations of either IL-1α/IFN-γ/TNF-α or IL-1α/IFN-γ (Fig. 3 B). Initial apoptotic events are known to result in the activation of the proteolytic enzyme cascades involving caspases which cleave specific proteins and irreversibly commit the cell to apoptotic death (44Salvesen G.S. Dixit V.M. Cell. 1997; 91: 443-446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1943) Google Scholar). Inhibition of this proteolytic cascade can be achieved using a broadly selective caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK (45Villa P. Kaufmann S.H. Earnshaw W.C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 388-393Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar). We therefore used this caspase inhibitor to assess whether cytokine-driven iNOS production was dependent upon activation of caspases. Hence, pretreatment of cells with 50 μm Z-VAD-FMK completely abrogates the apoptosis of HT-29 cells stimulated by IL-1α/IFN-γ/TNF-α, IL-1α/IFN-γ, IFN-γ/TNF-α, and IFN-γ/CH11 (Fig.4 A). However, the caspase inhibitor did not interfere with the observed ability of HT-29 cells to generate nitrite in response to IL-1α/IFN-γ/TNF-α or IL-1α/IFN-γ (Fig. 4 B), as does pretreatment with IL-13. Furthermore, IFNγ/TNFα (Fig. 4 B) and IFNγ/CH11 (data not shown) are not able to induce iNOS or stimulate the generation of nitrite, but are able to stimulate apoptosis (Fig. 4 A). Together, these data indicate that cytokine-driven iNOS activation and apoptosis are separable, inde"
https://openalex.org/W2043277263,"A UV response that involves the Ras proteins and AP-1 transcription factors has recently been described in mammals and yeast. To test whether an equivalent response exists in plants, we monitored the expression of Arabidopsis histidinol dehydrogenase gene (HDH), a homologue of the yeastHIS4 gene, which is strongly induced by UV light and is a target of the transcriptional activator Gcn4. We show thatHDH mRNA levels increase specifically in response to UV-B light. Only small increases were detected upon exposure to other wavelengths. To isolate plant genes involved in this UV response, agcn4 mutant was transfected with an Arabidopsis thaliana cDNA library. A new type of nucleotide diphosphate kinase (NDPK Ia) with a significant homology to the human tumor suppressor protein Nm23 rescued the gcn4 phenotype. NDPK Ia specifically binds to the HIS4 promoter in vitro and induces HIS4 transcription in yeast. InArabidopsis, the NDPK Ia protein is located in the nucleus and cytosol. Expression studies in seedlings revealed that the level ofNDPK Ia mRNA, like that of HDH , increases in response to UV-B light. It appears that NDPK Ia and HDH are components of a novel UV-responsive pathway in A. thaliana.

It appears that NDPK Ia and HDH are components of a novel UV-responsive pathway in A. thaliana. Exposure of cells and organisms to UV light evokes a complex set of protective and repair responses. Because short wavelengths are absorbed mostly by nucleic acids, it is reasonable to assume that the most significant UV-mediated damages occur in cellular DNA. Various DNA repair systems are indeed induced following exposure to UV. This response has been identified in all prokaryotes and eukaryotes studied (1Little J.W. Mount D.W. Cell. 1982; 29: 11-22Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1031) Google Scholar, 2Walker G.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 425-457Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Britt A.B. Annu. Rev.

Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2632-2643Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). However, additional UV responses exist in eukaryotes, which seem to be unrelated to repair mechanisms (reviewed in Ref. 5Herrlich P. Blattner C. Knebel A. Bender K. Rahmsdorf H.J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 378: 1217-1229PubMed Google Scholar). In mammalian cells, this response involves activation of membrane components, such as tyrosine kinase receptors and the proto-oncoprotein Ras (6Devary Y. Gottlieb R.A. Smeal T. Karin M. Cell. 1992; 71: 1081-1091Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (795) Google Scholar, 7Hibi M. Lin A. Smeal T. Minden A. Karin M.

EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5314-5325Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar). Activated Ras in turn induces cytoplasmic cascades that lead to activation of transcription factors of the AP-1 family (e.g. c-Jun and ATF2) and NFκB (6Devary Y. Gottlieb R.A. Smeal T. Karin M. Cell. 1992; 71: 1081-1091Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (795) Google Scholar, 10Devary Y. Rosette C. DiDonato J. Karin M. Science. 1993; 261: 1442-1445Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar, 11Bender K. Gottlicher M. Whiteside S. Rahmsdorf H.J. Herrlich P. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5170-5181Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). A similar UV response, which is not related to DNA damage, has also been identified in yeast (12Engelberg D. Klein C. Martinetto H. Struhl K. Karin M. Cell. 1994; 77: 381-390Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). In this organism, the UV response involves activation of Ras2, which leads to activation of a transcription factor of the AP-1 family (Gcn4, a functional homologue of c-Jun) (13Struhl K. Nature. 1988; 332: 649-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). As a result, Gcn4 target genes, such as HIS4 (see below), are strongly activated by UV. Indirect evidence suggests that these conserved Ras2/AP-1 pathways have a protective function (5Herrlich P. Blattner C. Knebel A. Bender K. Rahmsdorf H.J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 378: 1217-1229PubMed Google Scholar, 12Engelberg D. Klein C. Martinetto H. Struhl K. Karin M. Cell. 1994; 77: 381-390Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). In yeast, the bZIP transcription factor Gcn4 is activated not only by UV but also by amino acid starvation. Under these conditions, Gcn4 activation does not involve the Ras cascade, but rather the activity of the Gcn2 kinase (12Engelberg D. Klein C. Martinetto H. Struhl K. Karin M. Cell. 1994; 77: 381-390Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 14Dever T.E. Feng L. Wek R.C. Cigan A.M. Donahue T.F. Hinnebusch A.G. Cell. 1992; 68: 585-596Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar, 15Rolfes R.J. Hinnebusch A.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 5099-5111Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Activation of Gcn4 in response to amino acid starvation seems rational because Gcn4 target genes encode amino acid biosynthetic enzymes. Some of the most prominent Gcn4 targets areHIS3 and HIS4, which encode enzymes of histidine biosynthesis (16Hinnebusch A.G. Microbiol. Rev. 1988; 52: 248-273Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although starvation and UV induce different signal transduction elements for activation of Gcn4, both stimuli need intactGcn4 for induction of HIS genes (12Engelberg D. Klein C. Martinetto H. Struhl K. Karin M. Cell. 1994; 77: 381-390Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 14Dever T.E. Feng L. Wek R.C. Cigan A.M. Donahue T.F. Hinnebusch A.G. Cell. 1992; 68: 585-596Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar). Plants also respond to UV in the range between 280 nm and 350 nm by a complex set of reactions (17Jordan B. Adv. Bot. Res. 1996; 22: 98-138Google Scholar). Beside the activation of DNA repair systems (reviewed in Ref. 3Britt A.B. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1996; 47: 75-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar), plants respond with the rapid synthesis of pigments, primarily flavonoids, which requires activation of specific genes and transcription factors (18Hahlbrock K. Scheel D. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1989; 40: 347-369Crossref Google Scholar). Although UV-dependent cis-acting elements were identified in the promoter of chalcone synthase, which encodes a key enzyme in flavonoid synthesis, the biochemical system that senses the UV signal and exerts the relevant genes is still elusive. Indirect evidence points to the involvement of calcium, calmodulin, and kinases in UV-dependent flavonoid synthesis (19Christie J. Jenkins G. Plant Cell. 1996; 8: 1555-1567Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar, 20Frohnmeyer H. Bowler C. Schaefer E. J. Exp. Bot. 1997; 48: 739-750Crossref Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 21Frohnmeyer H. Bowler C. Xhu G. Yamagata H. Schaefer E. Chua N.-H. Plant J. 1998; 13: 763-772Crossref Scopus (43) Google Scholar) and to the involvement of jasmonate in UV-dependent expression of proteinase inhibitor genes (22Conconi A. Smerdon M.J. Howe G.A. Ryan C.A. Nature. 1996; 383: 826-829Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar), suggesting that various UV signaling pathways exist in plants. It is assumed that amino acid biosynthesis in plants is similar to that in bacteria and yeast (23Brews T. Coruzzi G.M. Genetic Engineering. Plenum Press, New York1991: 221-236Crossref Google Scholar). This similarity is manifested in the fact that several genes related to this pathway were capable of functionally complementing the respective yeast mutants (24Niyogi K.K. Fink G.R. Plant Cell. 1992; 4: 721-733PubMed Google Scholar, 25Frommer W.B. Hummel S. Riesmeier J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5944-5948Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 26Hsu L.C.

Plant Physiol. 1997; 115: 1127-1134Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Histidine biosynthesis in Arabidopsis involves several genes with high sequence homology to corresponding genes from yeast. Representative examples are the genes encoding imidazole glycerol phosphate dehydratase (IPGD) 1The abbreviations used are: IPGD, imidazole glycerol phosphate dehydratase; GFP, green fluorescent protein; GST, glutathione S-transferase; HDH, histidinol dehydrogenase; NDPK, nucleoside diphosphate kinase; 3-AT, 3-aminotriazole 1The abbreviations used are: IPGD, imidazole glycerol phosphate dehydratase; GFP, green fluorescent protein; GST, glutathione S-transferase; HDH, histidinol dehydrogenase; NDPK, nucleoside diphosphate kinase; 3-AT, 3-aminotriazolewith 44% identity to yeast HIS3 (28Tada S. Volrath S. Guyer D. Scheidegger A. Ryals J. Ohta D. Ward E. Plant Physiol. 1994; 105: 79-83Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar), and histidinol dehydrogenase (HDH) with 51% idendity to yeast HIS4 (29Nagai A. Ward E. Beck J. Tada S. Chang J.Y. Scheidegger A. Ryals J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 4133-4137Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). It was therefore decided to test whether HDH, the plant homologue of HIS4, is UV responsive, as is the case in yeast. We demonstrate here that this is indeed the case. We show that UV-B irradiation of Arabidopsis seedlings specifically stimulates HDH mRNA accumulation. This result suggests that a UV-dependent Ras/AP-1 cascade might exist in plants, which is similar to the mammalian and yeast cascade. This plant pathway could be revealed via systematic functional complementation of the relevant yeast mutants. In a first functional complementation screen, we searched for Arabidopsis thaliana cDNAs that would rescue the gcn4 phenotype. We have identified a new nucleoside diphosphate kinase (termed NDPK Ia) fromArabidopsis with remarkable homology to the mammalian tumor suppressor protein Nm23. Nm23-H2 was reported to bind DNA and is hypothesized to be a transcriptional regulator (30Postel E.H. Berberich S.J. Flint S.J. Ferrone C.A. Science. 1993; 261: 478-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar). We show thatArabidopsis NDPK Ia binds the promoter of HIS4and induces HIS4 transcription in yeast. Its transcription in plants is strongly induced by UV-B light in a pattern very similar to that of HDH expression. NDPK Ia might play a role as a transcriptional regulator in the UV-B light-mediated expression of histidine biosynthesis in plants and yeast. Our results also imply that aspects of the (non-DNA damage) UV response are common to plants and yeast. E. coli strain XL1 blue (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) was used for plasmid manipulations and amplification of a cDNA library. Expression of glutathioneS-transferase (GST) fusion proteins was carried out in the strain M15[pREP4] (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Nearly isogenicSaccharomyces cerevesiae strains SP1 (MATa, his3, can, ade8, leu2, trp1 ura3), SP1 harboring HIS3 (isogenic to SP1 but with integrated HIS3), and gcn4Δ1(MAT a, ura3, leu2, gcn4Δ1) were used in this study (12Engelberg D. Klein C. Martinetto H. Struhl K. Karin M. Cell. 1994; 77: 381-390Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). A. thaliana (L.) ecotype Landsberg erecta were grown on soil with 16 h light/8 h dark cycles at 20 °C, and leaf, stem, and floral tissues were isolated from 6-week-old plants. Etiolated seedlings were grown on filter paper for 3 or 5 days in darkness and then transferred to different light programs. An isogenic, auxotrophic A. thaliana cell culture was grown in MS medium containing 0.6% sucrose under continuous irradiation (25 °C at 120 rpm) and subcultured weekly (10 ml in 40 ml of fresh medium). Cell cultures were used 3 days after passage for protoplast formation. Cells (10 g) were digested for 3.5 h at room temperature in 1.2% Cellulase Onozuka R-10 and 0.25% Macerozyme dissolved in MS/0.3 m mannitol and then diluted with 1 volume of 0.24 m CaCl2 and precipitated for 3 min at 400 × g. The cell pellet was resuspended in electroporation buffer (10 mm Tris/HEPES (pH 7.2), 15 mm MgCl2, 0.5 m sucrose) and flotated after centrifugation (5 min at 140 × g). The supernatant contained high amounts of intact protoplasts that were directly used for transformation. Protoplasts (8 × 106) were mixed with 75 μg of plasmid DNA, incubated for 1 min at room temperature and transformed by electroporation (810 V/cm2, 125 μF). Cells were subsequently incubated in MS/0.5 m mannitol for 10–16 h until detection of green fluorescent protein (GFP) fluorescence. UV-B light irradiation was carried out with two Phillips TL/12 bulbs and one Osram 36W/73 bulb and DNA-damaging fluences cut-off by a 305 nm filter (Schott, Mainz, Germany). The fluence rate was 21 μmol of photons·m−2·s−1 emitting light between 305 and 380 nm. The UV-A spectra (19 μmol of photons·m−2·s−1, 340–390 nm), blue light (38 μmol of photons·m−2·s−1) and red light (19 μmol of photons·m−2·s−1) irradiations, and the dim green safe light in which the plants were harvested have been described elsewhere (31Schaefer E. Optische Strahlungsquellen. Lexica Verlag, Grafenau, Germany1977: 249-266Google Scholar). Large scale yeast transformation was carried out according to (32Gietz D. St. Jean A. Woods R.A. Schiestl R.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 1425Crossref PubMed Scopus (2863) Google Scholar). Young, light-grown Arabidopsis seedlings were used for the preparation of the cDNA library that was integrated into the yeast expression vector pFL61. The cDNA was constitutively expressed under the control of a PGK promoter in yeast (33Minet M. Dufour M.E. Lacroute F. Plant J. 1992; 2: 417-422PubMed Google Scholar) and was kindly provided by M. Minet (CNRS, Gif sur Yvette, France). For complementation of the yeast gcn4 mutant, cells were transformed with the cDNA library and grown at 30 °C for 5–6 days on plates containing synthetic complete medium CM lacking uracil and histidine and supplemented with 20 mm 3-aminotriazole (CMUH + 3-AT). Plasmids from growing colonies were isolated and re-transformed into gcn4 to confirm complementation and exclude false positives. Arabidopsis cDNA clones from the complementation screen were excised from pFL61 byNotI digestion and integrated into pKS for sequence analysis. The N terminus of NDPK Ia was subsequently cloned by rapid amplifications of 5′ cDNA ends from an ArabidopsiscDNA library. For construction of fusion proteins,BamHI-compatible restriction sites were introduced at the 5′-ends and SalI sites at the 3′-ends of NDPK Iaand of Δ1–79 NDPK Ia ORF by PCR using the gene-specific primers (5′-end, CCAGGCCTCGTTGTATGCCATCAGGTTTCACC; Δ1–79 5′-end, GGA TCCAAATGGAGGACGTTG; 3′-end, GTCGACCTCCCTTAGCCATGT) and subcloned into pKS. The GST fusion cassette pGEX-5x-1 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was BamHI/SalI-digested, and the NDPK Ia cDNA was integrated in-frame at the C terminus of the glutathione S-transferase cDNA. The GFP expression cassette was removed from the pBI121-mGFP4 construct (34Haseloff J. Siemering K.R. Prasher D.C. Hodge S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2122-2127Crossref PubMed Scopus (1106) Google Scholar) by HindIII/EcoRI digestion and transferred into pUC18 (mGFP4-pUC18). Afterward a 5′ BamHI followed by an in-frame SmaI restriction site were introduced into mGFP4 coding region by PCR using the primers following primers: 5′-end, CGGGATCCCGCCCGGGATGAGTAAAGGAGAAGAACTTTTCACTG; 3′-end, GCGGAGCTCTTATTTGTATAGTTCATCCATCCATGCC. The resulting plasmid (mAV 4) was used for the construction of the NDPK Ia coding regions fused to the C terminus of GFP in mGFP4 byBamHI/SalI digestion and in-frame integration into mAV4. The NLS-mGFP4 and PHYA-mGFP4 constructs will be described elsewhere. All new DNA sequences were verified by sequencing both strands. The Δ1–79 NDPK Ia-GST fusion protein was expressed in M15pREP4, and single step purification of the fusion protein was carried out as described (35Smith D.B. Johnson K.S. Gene. 1988; 67: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (5028) Google Scholar). The N-terminal GST protein was removed by cleavage of the fusion protein with 10 μg of factor Xa (in 20 mm Tris (pH 8), 100 mm NaCl, 2 mmCaCl2) for 12 h at 20 °C. All purification steps were monitored by protein staining of each fraction after SDS-PAGE.In vitro transcription and subsequent in vitrotranslation reactions were carried out as described in (36Weisshaar B. Block A. Armstrong G. Herrmann A. Schulze-Lefert P. Hahlbrock K. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1777-1786Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). DNA binding of NDPK Ia was assessed in gel electrophoretic mobility shift assays. Standard reactions were carried out with32P-end-labeled yeast HIS4 promoter fragments containing the Gcn4 sites (−235 to −67) (37Lucchini G. Hinnebusch A. Chen C. Fink G.R. Mol. Cell.

Each binding reaction was performed with 1 ng of 32P-labeled probe, 100 ng of protein, 100 ng of poly(dI-dC) in Gcn4-binding buffer (38Hope I. Struhl K. Cell. 1985; 43: 177-188Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). The mixture was incubated for 30 min on ice, and NDPK Ia/DNA complexes resolved on 6% native polyacrylamide gels. NDPK activity was measured spectrophotometrically in a coupled pyruvate kinase/lactate dehydrogenase assay using 100–400 ng of recombinant protein (39Luebeck J. Soll J. Planta. 1995; 196: 668-673Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To determine the effect of DNA binding on the enzyme, activity fractions containing NDPK (400 ng) and DNA from theHIS4 promoter (1 ng) were preincubated on ice for 30 min before determination of the enzymatic analysis. GFP fluorescence in transiently transformed Arabidopsisprotoplasts was studied by epifluorescence and Nomarski interference contrast microscopy and analyzed in an Axiovert microscope (Zeiss, Oberkochem, Germany). Excitation of GFP was performed with standard fluorescein isothiocyanate filters, and a clear distinction between GFP fluorescence and background fluorescence could be detected (see Fig. 6,A and B). For each construct, 10–20 protoplasts were documented using an automatic Contax 167 MT camera and Eastman Kodak Co. 64T film. RNA from Arabidopsis was isolated as described (40Frohnmeyer H. Ehmann B.

Gene-specific cDNA probes of HDH (29Nagai A. Ward E. Beck J. Tada S. Chang J.Y. Scheidegger A. Ryals J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Plant Physiol. 1994; 105: 79-83Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar) were kindly provided by Dr. E. Ward (Ciba, Research Triangle Park, NC), and these probes, as well as aBamHI/SalI fragment of NDPK Ia and18SrRNA, were labeled by random priming (Roche Molecular Biochemicals); 107 cpm was used for hybridization. Aliquots of 20 μg of total RNA were used for Northern blot hybridization as described previously (40Frohnmeyer H. Ehmann B. Kretsch T. Rocholl M. Harter K. Nagatani A. Furuya M. Batschauer A. Hahlbrock K. Schaefer E. Plant J. 1992; 2: 899-906Crossref Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Membranes were washed twice in 2× SSC/0.2% SDS at 42 °C and in 1× SSC/0.2% SDS at 64 °C. X-ray films were exposed at −80 °C using intensifying screens. Total RNA from yeast was prepared from cultures grown to logarithmic phase on synthetic complete medium (lacking uracil) and was assayed by primer extension analysis (12Engelberg D. Klein C. Martinetto H. Struhl K. Karin M. Cell. 1994; 77: 381-390Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). RNA (20 μg) was hybridized with 1 ng of 32P-labeled oligonucleotides (HIS4,5′-CAAGTGTTCGGCTG TTTTAGCATC-3′; HIS3,5′-CGCAATCTGAATCTTGGTTTC-3′; actin,5′-GTTATCAATAACCAAAGCAGCAAC-3′). Avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase was used for the extension reaction, and the products were separated on 6% acrylamide/7 m urea gels. The nucleotide sequence for the full-length NDPK Ia has been deposited in the GenBankTM data base under accession number AJ012758. The corresponding Δ1–79 NDPK Ia sequence has been deposited under GenBankTM accession number AF058391. To test whether a UV response similar to the yeast Ras/Gcn4-mediated response (which results in induction ofHIS4 transcription) exists in plants, we studied the effect of different wavelengths on transcription of the Arabidopsis HDH gene. RNAs were prepared from seedlings that were grown in darkness for 3 days and then transferred to different wavelengths. Northern blot analyses of these RNAs (Fig.1) show that HDH mRNA levels are strongly expressed in the presence of UV-B light, whereas exposure to either white light, UV-A, blue light, or red light irradiation did not result in significant expression. Remarkably, the difference between UV-A and UV-B irradiation consisted only in additional wavelengths from 305 to 340 nm (2 μmol·m−2·s−1), underscoring the high degree of specificity of the response to UV-B light. Our results also demonstrates that in plants, like in yeast, expression of a gene related to histidine biosynthesis is induced by UV light. The light regime (UV-B supplemented by UV-A) stimulates photoreactivation inArabidopsis, leading to the reversion of possible damage to DNA (3Britt A.B. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1996; 47: 75-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). The high degree of conservation of the UV response between yeast and plants suggests the use of yeast mutants for functional cloning of plant genes involved in this response. To test this approach, we introduced anArabidopsis cDNA library (33Minet M. Dufour M.E. Lacroute F. Plant J. 1992; 2: 417-422PubMed Google Scholar) into a gcn4mutant. Transformants were grown under amino acid limitation (20 mm 3-AT). Under these conditions, cells survive only if they express an intact Gcn4 (16Hinnebusch A.G. Microbiol. Rev. 1988; 52: 248-273Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, gcn4 cells harboring the empty expression plasmid pFL61 were unable to grow, whereas a wild type strain (SP1) grew normally (Fig.2). Following transformation ofArabidopsis cDNA library, several colonies grew on the 3-AT plates. The corresponding plasmids were rescued and reintroduced into the gcn4 strain for a second round of screening. One clone remained that rendered gcn4 cells capable of growing under amino acid limitation (Fig. 2). Sequence analysis of the cDNA revealed a strong homology to nucleoside diphosphate kinases from other organisms (Fig.3). The size of the cDNA was 806 base pairs, and it encoded an ORF of 152 amino acids (GenBankTMaccession number AF058391, also referred to as Δ1–79 NDPK Ia). The N terminus was extended by rapid amplifications of 5′ cDNA ends, resulting in an ORF of 231 amino acids (Fig. 3) (GenBankTMaccession number AJ012758, also referred to as NDPK Ia), and the corresponding protein had an apparent size of approximately 25 kDa (data not shown). The protein contains domains, which are described in other NDPKs as a ATP/GTP binding site motif A (P-loop, amino acids 166–173), and the crucial site for the catalytic mechanism (His-197). In addition, two out of the three basic amino acids (Lys-113 and Lys-214), which are crucial for DNA binding of the human homologue Nm23-H2 (41Postel E.H. Weiss V.H. Beneken J. Kirtane A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1996; 93: 6892-6897Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), were found in the NDPK Ia sequence. The cDNA contains an N-terminal extension, which is common in plant type II NDPKs. Although this region is suggested to mediate chloroplast targeting of some plant NDPKs, no similarity to known chloroplast leader sequences was found for NDPK Ia by the use of data base PSORT. Further data base searches revealed three more NDPK sequences from A. thaliana (ecotype Columbia). Compared with NDPK Ia, NDPK 2 differs in only 3 amino acids (98.7% identity), whereas NDPK 3 shows only 39% identity. NDPK 1 lacks an N-terminal extension and has a 53.9% homology to NDPK Ia (Fig. 3). The high similarity to NDPK 2 may reflect the cloning of an identical gene from a different ecotype (Landsberg erecta versus Columbia). The highest level of identity from other plants including the N-terminal extension was found for spinach and pea NDPK (62.8%). Surprisingly, a remarkable sequence identity was also found with the Drosophila Awd (abnormal wing disc) gene (57%) and with the human tumor-suppressor proteins Nm23-H1 (54%) and Nm23-H2 (51%). The unexpected isolation of NDPK Ia as a suppressor of cells lacking Gcn4 activity raises the question of specificity. Does NDPK Ia induce transcription of Gcn4 target genes, or does it rescue thegcn4 phenotype via an indirect mechanism, as described (42Kanazawa S. Driscoll M. Struhl K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 664-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar)? To address this question, we determined NDPK Ia DNA binding activity and its ability to induce HIS4 and HIS3transcription in yeast. We also monitored its intracellular localization and light-dependent transcription inArabidopsis. The finding that NDPK Ia is able to complement thegcn4 mutation implies its function as a transcriptional regulator. The yeast HIS4 promoter contains three Gcn4 binding sites (43Arndt K. Fink G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 8516-8520Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar) and represents a target of the complementation screening. A fragment of the promoter (from −238 to −58) was therefore chosen as a probe for DNA binding assay. The N-terminal deletion of NDPK Ia (Δ1–79 NDPK Ia) was expressed as GST fusion protein, followed by proteolytical treatment to remove the GST tag before subjected to electrophoretic mobility shift assay. The NDPK Ia full-length protein was expressed by coupled in vitrotranscription/translation reactions and subjected to electrophoretic mobility shift assay. Fig. 4 shows that both proteins strongly bind to the HIS4 promoter (Fig. 4,A, lane 1, and C, lane 1). Surprisingly, the Δ1–79 NDPK Ia-GST fusion protein was unable to bind to the promoter under identical conditions as used for the cleaved NDPK Ia protein (Fig. 4 A, lane 2 compared with lane 1). Under our conditions, the human homologous protein Nm23-H2 (which was kindly provided by Dr. M. Veron, Institut Pasteur, Paris, France) also interacts with the HIS4 promoter (Fig. 4 A, lane 4). As expected, DNA binding of Nm23-H2 was strongly inhibited by excess of poly(dI-dC) (not shown); poly-pyrimidine-rich sequences were shown to be putative binding sites of Nm23-H2 (44Hildebrandt M. Lacombe M.L. Mesnildrey S. Veron M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 3858-3864Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). ForArabidopsis NDPK Ia and its N-terminal deletion, 100 ng of poly(dI-dC) (Fig. 4) or 500 ng of salmon sperm DNA (Fig. 4 C, lanes 1 and 3) did not interfere with DNA binding. The binding specificity of NDPK Ia, Δ1–79 NDPK Ia, and Nm23-H2 to theHIS4 promoter was further demonstrated by efficient competition of the binding with excess of unlabeled probe (Fig. 4,B, lanes 1–7, and C, lanes 3–7). The direct involvement of NDPK Ia in transcriptional activation ofHIS genes was demonstrated in yeast. Gcn4 cells harboring either the control plasmid pFL61, the NDPK Ia expression plasmid, or Δ1–79 NDPK Ia were grown under nonlimiting conditions. Cells of the RAS2 Val-19 strain in whichHIS4 expression is constitutively induced (12Engelberg D. Klein C. Martinetto H. Struhl K. Karin M. Cell. 1994; 77: 381-390Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar) were used as a positive control. Primer extension analysis revealed, thatHIS3 and HIS4 expression was marginal ingcn4 (Fig. 5, lanes 1 and 4), whereas HIS4 transcripts were strongly increased in three independent experiments if Δ1–79 NDPK Ia (lane 2) or the full-length protein (lane 5) was expressed in this mutant. HIS4 transcript levels, determined in strains expressing NDPK Ia, were comparable to levels measured inRAS2 Val-19 (lane 3), indicating the constitutive activation of the signaling cascade. NDPK Ia was also able to stimulate HIS3 transcripts in the absence of UV light or starvation, but the induction was significantly lower than that ofHIS4 (Fig. 5, lanes 1–3). The results presented above suggest that NDPK Ia was able to rescue gcn4 cells by virtue of its function as a transcriptional activator that binds DNA. This result"
https://openalex.org/W1978896111,"EMILIN (elastin microfibril interface located protein) is an extracellular matrix glycoprotein abundantly expressed in elastin-rich tissues such as blood vessels, skin, heart, and lung. It occurs associated with elastic fibers at the interface between amorphous elastin and microfibrils. Avian EMILIN was extracted from 19-day-old embryonic chick aortas and associated blood vessels and purified by ion-exchange chromatography and gel filtration. Tryptic peptides were generated from EMILIN and sequenced, and degenerate inosine-containing oligonucleotide primers were designed from some peptides. A set of primers allowed the amplification of a 360-base pair reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction product from chick aorta mRNA. A probe based on a human homologue selected by comparison of the chick sequence with EST data base was used to select overlapping clones from both human aorta and kidney cDNA libraries. Here we present the cDNA sequence of the entire coding region of human EMILIN encompassing an open reading frame of 1016 amino acid residues. There was a high degree of homology (76% identity and 88% similarity) between the chick C terminus and the human sequence as well as between the N terminus of the mature chick protein where 10 of 12 residues, as determined by N-terminal sequencing, were identical or similar to the deduced N terminus of human EMILIN. The domain organization of human EMILIN includes a C1q-like globular domain at the C terminus, a collagenous stalk, and a longer segment in which at least four heptad repeats and a leucine zipper can be identified with a high potential for forming coiled-coil alpha helices. At the N terminus there is a cysteine-rich sequence stretch similar to a region of multimerin, a platelet and endothelial cell component, containing a partial epidermal growth factor-like motif. The native state of the recombinantly expressed EMILIN C1q-like domain to be used in cell adhesion was determined by CD spectra analysis, which indicated a high value of beta-sheet conformation. The EMILIN C1q-like domain promoted a high cell adhesion of the leiomyosarcoma cell line SK-UT-1, whereas the fibrosarcoma cell line HT1080 was negative."

Phycobilisomes are large supramolecular aggregates attached to the stromal side of the thylakoid membrane in cyanobacteria, red algae, and cryptomonads. These supramolecular aggregates are light-harvesting protein pigment complexes that are composed of phycobiliproteins and linker proteins. Based on the absorption of visible light, the phycobiliproteins can be divided into three main groups: phycoerythrin (PE) 1The abbreviations used are: PE, phycoerythrin; APC, allophycocyanin; PC, phycocyanin; C-PC, C-phycocyanin; PEC, phycoerythrocyanin; APC-PY, allophycocyanin from P. yezoensis ; APC-SP, APC from S. platensis ; C-PC-AQ, C-PC from A. quadruplaticum ; C-PC-FR, C-PC from F. diplosiphon ; R-PE-PU, R-PE from Polysiphonia urceolata ; PCB, phycocyanobilin; α, 1β, 2α, 2β, … 6β stand for the individual subunits of different monomers within the hexamer (according to Schirmer et al.

With the help of linker proteins, phycobiliproteins form the two distinct structural domains of phycobilisome, the core and the rods. The core, which is composed of three or more core cylinders associated by APC discs, is in proximity of the reaction centers, whereas the rods are attached on the core and are composed of PC discs in the middle and PE or PEC discs on the tip. Light energy is transferred from PE or PEC via PC to APC and finally to the reaction centers (1Glazer A.N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 768: 29-51Crossref Scopus (415) Google Scholar).The crystal structures of several phycobiliproteins have been solved; among them, three are PEs (2Ficner R. Huber R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 218: 103-106Crossref Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 3Ficner R. Lobeck K. Schimdt G. Huber R. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 228: 935-950Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 4Chang W.R.

Biol. 1990; 211: 633-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), and one is APC:APC from Spirulina platensis (9Brejc K. Ficner R. Huber R. Steinbacher S. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 249: 424-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). All these structures are very similar. The basic building block is an αβ monomer composed of α and β subunits (R-phycoerythrin (R-PE) and B-phycoerythrin (B-PE) have a third subunit γ in the center of the molecule); three αβ monomers are arranged around a 3-fold symmetry axis to form an (αβ)3 trimer or two (αβ)3 trimers, which are assembled face to face into an (αβ)6 hexamer.The crystal structure of APC is very special compared with other phycobiliproteins. First, the spectrum difference between APC trimer and its monomer is very large. When APC monomers aggregate to trimer, the absorption spectrum has a 40-nm red shift; the CD spectrum also changes a great deal, and exiton interaction in the trimer of APC was suggested (10Csatorday K. MacColl R. Csizmadia V. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 6466-6470Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), whereas the spectrum difference between C-PC monomer and its trimer is not so large as in APC, although phycocyanin has the same α84PCB and β84PCB as APC.Second, the functional unit of APC was thought to be a trimer, whereas the function unit of other phycobiliproteins were hexamer (αβ)6 or (αβ)6γ. Brejc and co-workers solved the structure of APC-SP from blue alga S. platensis(9Brejc K. Ficner R. Huber R. Steinbacher S. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 249: 424-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar) in the unit cell of APC-SP crystal; two trimers are associated in a “back to back” manner that might represent the assembly state of APC in nature. Red alga is higher than blue alga in evolution, so it would be interesting to know the packing of APC from red alga in the unit cell and in nature.Third, in PE and PC, the two trimeric discs are superimposed along a 3-fold axis, but in PC and APC the two discs are connected perpendicularly. The pathway of energy transfer between PC and APC is still unknown.The red algae Porphyra yezoensis is an algae that exists widely in nature. Its phycobilisomes contain R-PE, C-PC, and APC. In this paper we report the crystal structure of APC from P. yezoensis (APC-PY) at 2.2-Å resolution. The organization of APC trimers in the core cylinders of phycobiliproteins and the pathway of energy transfer were discussed.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCrystallization and data collection of APC-PY was reported earlier (11Liu J.Y. Zhang J.P. Wan Z.L. Liang D.C. Zhang J.P. Wu H.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sec. D. 1998; 54: 662-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). The crystals of APC-PY belong to space group R32 with parameters a = b = 105.3 Å, c = 189.4 Å, α = β = 90°, and γ = 120°.Molecular replacement using program AMoRe (12Navaza J. Acta Crystallogr. Sec. A. 1994; 50: 157-163Crossref Scopus (5027) Google Scholar) was carried out using the 2.3-Å structure of APC-SP as a model. Model cell parameters were a = b = c = 150.0 Å, α = β = γ = 90°, integrate radius was 30 Å, and rotation function calculation gave a rather high coefficient solution, α = 60.07, β = 3.06, γ = 88.03, Cc = 20.0. The orientations and positions of one αβ in the asymmetric unit were determined by the translation function with a high correlation coefficient of 66.9%. The R-factor in the range from 10 to 4 Å was 36.1%. After rigid-body refinement, R-factor dropped to 33.1%, and the correlation coefficient increased to 71.2%. The packing of molecules in the unit cell was reasonable.The structure was refined using X-PLOR (13Brünger A. XPLOR, Version 2.1. Yale University, New Haven, CN1990Google Scholar). The consensus sequence was used for the initial model building. Fourier transform and electron density were first calculated in the resolution range of 10 Å to 3.5 Å. Residues that could not be fitted into the electron density map were omitted from the phase calculation in the next refinement cycle. After several cycles of rigid body, positional refinement, and manual model adjustment, the R-factor dropped to 25.4%, and a 2Fo-Fc Fourier map looked quite good. Then the resolution was extended to 2.2 Å. After the chromophores were fitted in the map and followed by several cycles of positional refinement and model adjustment, the electron density improved further. At this stage almost all side chains were well defined except those on the surface. Residue exchanges were carried out at this stage according to the omit map. After several cycles of positional refinement and model adjustment, the R-factor was converged to 24.0%, the individual B-factors were then refined, and the R-factor dropped to 21.5%. 169 water molecules were added to the model according to the Fo-Fc and 2Fo-Fc maps, and the final R-factor of the model was 19.3% (R-free factor was 26.9%) in the range of 10 Å to 2.2 Å.

Biol. 1996; 262: 721-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), three are C-phycocyanins (C-PCs) (5Schirmer T. Bode W. Huber R. Sidler W. Zuber H. J. Mol.

Biol. 1991; 217: 577-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar), one is PEC:PEC from Mastigocladus laminosus (8Duerring M. Huber R. Bode W. Ruembeli R. Zuber H. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 211: 633-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), and one is APC:APC from Spirulina platensis (9Brejc K. Ficner R. Huber R. Steinbacher S. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 249: 424-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). All these structures are very similar. The basic building block is an αβ monomer composed of α and β subunits (R-phycoerythrin (R-PE) and B-phycoerythrin (B-PE) have a third subunit γ in the center of the molecule); three αβ monomers are arranged around a 3-fold symmetry axis to form an (αβ)3 trimer or two (αβ)3 trimers, which are assembled face to face into an (αβ)6 hexamer. The crystal structure of APC is very special compared with other phycobiliproteins. First, the spectrum difference between APC trimer and its monomer is very large. When APC monomers aggregate to trimer, the absorption spectrum has a 40-nm red shift; the CD spectrum also changes a great deal, and exiton interaction in the trimer of APC was suggested (10Csatorday K. MacColl R. Csizmadia V. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 6466-6470Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), whereas the spectrum difference between C-PC monomer and its trimer is not so large as in APC, although phycocyanin has the same α84PCB and β84PCB as APC. Second, the functional unit of APC was thought to be a trimer, whereas the function unit of other phycobiliproteins were hexamer (αβ)6 or (αβ)6γ. Brejc and co-workers solved the structure of APC-SP from blue alga S. platensis(9Brejc K. Ficner R. Huber R. Steinbacher S. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 249: 424-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar) in the unit cell of APC-SP crystal; two trimers are associated in a “back to back” manner that might represent the assembly state of APC in nature. Red alga is higher than blue alga in evolution, so it would be interesting to know the packing of APC from red alga in the unit cell and in nature. Third, in PE and PC, the two trimeric discs are superimposed along a 3-fold axis, but in PC and APC the two discs are connected perpendicularly. The pathway of energy transfer between PC and APC is still unknown. The red algae Porphyra yezoensis is an algae that exists widely in nature. Its phycobilisomes contain R-PE, C-PC, and APC. In this paper we report the crystal structure of APC from P. yezoensis (APC-PY) at 2.2-Å resolution. The organization of APC trimers in the core cylinders of phycobiliproteins and the pathway of energy transfer were discussed. EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCrystallization and data collection of APC-PY was reported earlier (11Liu J.Y. Zhang J.P. Wan Z.L. Liang D.C. Zhang J.P. Wu H.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sec. D. 1998; 54: 662-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). The crystals of APC-PY belong to space group R32 with parameters a = b = 105.3 Å, c = 189.4 Å, α = β = 90°, and γ = 120°.Molecular replacement using program AMoRe (12Navaza J. Acta Crystallogr. Sec. A. 1994; 50: 157-163Crossref Scopus (5027) Google Scholar) was carried out using the 2.3-Å structure of APC-SP as a model. Model cell parameters were a = b = c = 150.0 Å, α = β = γ = 90°, integrate radius was 30 Å, and rotation function calculation gave a rather high coefficient solution, α = 60.07, β = 3.06, γ = 88.03, Cc = 20.0. The orientations and positions of one αβ in the asymmetric unit were determined by the translation function with a high correlation coefficient of 66.9%. The R-factor in the range from 10 to 4 Å was 36.1%. After rigid-body refinement, R-factor dropped to 33.1%, and the correlation coefficient increased to 71.2%. The packing of molecules in the unit cell was reasonable.The structure was refined using X-PLOR (13Brünger A. XPLOR, Version 2.1. Yale University, New Haven, CN1990Google Scholar). The consensus sequence was used for the initial model building. Fourier transform and electron density were first calculated in the resolution range of 10 Å to 3.5 Å. Residues that could not be fitted into the electron density map were omitted from the phase calculation in the next refinement cycle. After several cycles of rigid body, positional refinement, and manual model adjustment, the R-factor dropped to 25.4%, and a 2Fo-Fc Fourier map looked quite good. Then the resolution was extended to 2.2 Å. After the chromophores were fitted in the map and followed by several cycles of positional refinement and model adjustment, the electron density improved further. At this stage almost all side chains were well defined except those on the surface. Residue exchanges were carried out at this stage according to the omit map. After several cycles of positional refinement and model adjustment, the R-factor was converged to 24.0%, the individual B-factors were then refined, and the R-factor dropped to 21.5%. 169 water molecules were added to the model according to the Fo-Fc and 2Fo-Fc maps, and the final R-factor of the model was 19.3% (R-free factor was 26.9%) in the range of 10 Å to 2.2 Å.

The DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) can phosphorylate serine 15 of human p53 and the homologous serine 18 of murine p53in vitro. Contradictory reports exist about the requirement for DNA-PK in vivo for p53 activation and cell cycle arrest in response to ionizing radiation. While primary SCID (severe combined immunodeficiency) cells, that have defective DNA-PK, show normal p53 activation and cell cycle arrest, a transcriptionally inert form of p53 is induced in the SCID cell line SCGR11. In order to unambiguously define the role of the DNA-PK catalytic subunit (DNA-PKcs) in p53 activation, we examined p53 phosphorylation in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) from DNA-PKcs-null mice. We found a similar pattern of serine 18 phosphorylation and accumulation of p53 in response to irradiation in both control and DNA-PKcs-null MEFs. The induced p53 was capable of sequence-specific DNA binding even in the absence of DNA-PKcs. Transactivation of the cyclin-dependent-kinase inhibitor p21, a downstream target of p53, and the G1 cell cycle checkpoint were also found to be normal in the DNA-PKcs −/− MEFs. Our results demonstrate that DNA-PKcs, unlike the related ATM protein, is not essential for the activation of p53 and G1cell cycle arrest in response to ionizing radiation.

Our results demonstrate that DNA-PKcs, unlike the related ATM protein, is not essential for the activation of p53 and G1cell cycle arrest in response to ionizing radiation. When cells are exposed to DNA-damaging agents, there is accumulation of the p53 tumor suppressor protein and its activation as a transcription factor. This ultimately results in the arrest of cell cycle progression until the damage is repaired. Human p53 is phosphorylated within its transactivation domain at serine 15 in response to DNA damage (1Siliciano J.D. Canman C.E. Taya Y. Sakaguchi K. Appella E. Kastan M.B. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3471-3481Crossref PubMed Scopus (711) Google Scholar). Serine 15 phosphorylation results in reduced interaction of p53 with its negative regulator, the oncoprotein Mdm2, which, in turn, leads to the stabilization and activation of p53 (2Shieh S.-Y. Ikeda M. Taya Y. Prives C. Cell. 1997; 91: 325-334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1754) Google Scholar). Subsequent up-regulation of downstream target genes by p53, particularly the cyclin-dependent-kinase inhibitor p21, results in the arrest of cells in the G1 phase of the cell cycle (3Ko L.J. Prives C. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1054-1072Crossref PubMed Scopus (2292) Google Scholar). The DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) 1The abbreviations used are: DNA-PK, DNA-dependent protein kinase; DNA-PKcs, DNA-PK catalytic subunit; DSB, double-strand break; IR, ionizing radiation; SCID, severe combined immunodeficiency; AT, ataxia telangiectasia; MEF, mouse embryonic fibroblast; Gy, gray; RT-PCR, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; BrdUrd, bromodeoxyuridine; HO, Hoechst 33342; MI, mithramycin consists of a heterodimeric DNA-binding complex of Ku70 and Ku80 and a large catalytic subunit, DNA-PKcs. DNA-PKcs is a member of a subgroup of the phosphatidylinositol kinase superfamily, other members of which function in DNA damage responses and/or cell cycle control (4Jackson S.P. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1997; 29: 935-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). DNA-PKcs is a serine/threonine protein kinase that is activated by DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). DNA-PK is required for repair of DNA DSBs, and cells deficient in DNA-PKcs are hypersensitive to ionizing radiation (IR) and radiomimetic drugs. DNA-PK has been an attractive candidate for a molecule that activates p53 in response to ionizing radiation thereby linking DNA damage to cell cycle arrest. DNA-PK phosphorylates human p53 at serine 15 and murine p53 at the homologous serine 18 residue in vitro (5Lees-Miller S.P. Sakaguchi K. Ullrich S.J. Appella E. Anderson C.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5041-5049Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar,6Wang Y. Eckhart W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 4231-4235Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of p53 at serine 15 by purified DNA-PK leads to reduced interaction of p53 with Mdm2 in vitro and correlates with the stabilization of p53 and its activation as a transcription factor (2Shieh S.-Y. Ikeda M. Taya Y. Prives C. Cell. 1997; 91: 325-334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1754) Google Scholar). It has recently been reported that a SCID (severe combined immunodeficiency) cell line SCGR11 accumulates a transcriptionally inactive form of p53 upon irradiation (7Woo R.A. McLure K.G. Lees-Miller S.P. Rancourt D.E. Lee P.W.K. Nature. 1998; 394: 700-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). As SCID cells have defective DNA-PKcs (8Araki R. Fujimori A. Hamatani K. Mita K. Saito T. Mori M. Fukumura R. Morimyo M. Muto M. Itoh M. Tatsumi K. Abe M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2438-2443Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar), it would appear that DNA-PK indeed acts upstream of p53 in response to DNA damage. However, the role of DNA-PK in p53 activation has been called into question by reports of normal p53 induction and cell cycle arrest in response to IR in primary cells from SCID mice (9Huang L. Clarkin K.C. Wahl G.M. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 2940-2944PubMed Google Scholar, 10Guidos C.J. Williams C.J. Grandal I. Knowles G. Huang M.T. Danska J.S.

Kaufmann W.K. Hurt J.C. Byrd L.L. Chu G. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 68-74PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, the ATM protein, encoded by the gene responsible for the human genetic disorder ataxia telangiectasia (AT), is required for the phosphorylation of p53 at serine 15 in vivo in response to IR (13Banin S. Moyal L. Shieh S.-Y. Taya Y. Anderson C.W. Chessa L. Smorodinsky N.I. Prives C. Reiss Y. Shiloh Y. Ziv Y. Science. 1998; 281: 1674-1677Crossref PubMed Scopus (1706) Google Scholar, 14Canman C.E.

AT cells have normal levels of DNA-PK (15Jongmans W. Artuso M. Vuillaume M. Bresil H. Jackson S.P. Hall J. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 1133-1138PubMed Google Scholar), yet show reduced and delayed p53 serine-15 phosphorylation in response to IR (1Siliciano J.D. Canman C.E. Taya Y. Sakaguchi K. Appella E. Kastan M.B. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3471-3481Crossref PubMed Scopus (711) Google Scholar). These results, on the other hand, suggest that while DNA-PK may phosphorylate p53 in vitro, it may not play an essential role in the activation of p53 nor can it substitute for the ATM protein in response to IR. In order to definitively delineate the role of DNA-PK in p53 activation we utilized cells derived from DNA-PKcs-null mice. These cells, unlike primary SCID cells (7Woo R.A. McLure K.G. Lees-Miller S.P. Rancourt D.E. Lee P.W.K. Nature. 1998; 394: 700-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar), are completely deficient in DNA-PK kinase activity (16Kurimasa A. Ouyang H. Dong L.-J. Wang S. Li X. Cordon-Cardo C. Chen D.J. Li G.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1403-1408Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Transformed cell lines like SCGR11 often have mutations in p53. Therefore, studies were performed on early passage fibroblasts derived from 13.5-day-old mouse embryos. Control and DNA-PKcs-null cells were irradiated and compared with respect to accumulation of p53 protein, serine 18 phosphorylation of p53, sequence-specific DNA binding by p53, up-regulation of p21 gene expression, and integrity of the G1 cell cycle checkpoint. Primary fibroblasts were isolated from 13.5-day-old mouse embryos. The embryos were genotyped by PCR which distinguishes the endogenous from the targeted DNA-PKcs allele (16Kurimasa A. Ouyang H. Dong L.-J. Wang S. Li X. Cordon-Cardo C. Chen D.J. Li G.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1403-1408Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Cells were maintained in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2 in α-minimal essential medium supplemented with 20% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Cells were grown to 80% confluence and irradiated with137Cs γ-rays at the rate of 4.2 Gy/min to achieve a cumulative dose of 8 Gy for all experiments with the following exception. For flow cytometry, 50% confluent cells were irradiated with a cumulative dose of 6 Gy. For RT-PCR, total RNA was prepared from mock-irradiated or irradiated MEFs at 2 h post-irradiation using the Qiagen RNeasy kit (Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA). After digestion of contaminating genomic DNA by DNase I (Ambion, Austin, TX), cDNA synthesis was carried out with the Superscript preamplification system (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the included protocol. PCR primers used for RT-PCR were MD-3 (5′-ATCAGAAGGTCTAAGGCTGGAAT-3′) and MD-5 (5′-CGTACGGTGTTGGCTACTGC-3′) for amplification between exons 1 and 4 of DNA-PKcs and GA-5 (5′-AGAAGACTGTGGATGGCCCC-3′) and GA-3 (5′-AGGTCCACCACCCTGTTGC-3′) for control glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) amplification. Whole-cell extracts for DNA-PKcs Western blotting were prepared from mock-irradiated and irradiated MEFs at 2 h post-irradiation as described previously (17Peterson S.R. Stackhouse M. Waltman M.J. Chen F. Sato K. Chen D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10227-10231Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The protein concentration of extracts was determined by Bradford analysis using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Western blot analysis of DNA-PKcs was performed as described previously (18Peterson S.R. Kurimasa A. Oshimura M. Dynan W.S. Bradbury E.M. Chen D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3171-3174Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar) using anti-DNA-PKcs monoclonal antibodies (42–26) (NeoMarkers, Fremont, CA). SDS extracts for p53, p53 phosphoserine 15, and actin Western blotting were prepared from mock-irradiated or irradiated cells as described previously (19D'Anna J.A. Valdez J.G. Habbersett R.C. Crissman H.A. Radiat. Res. 1997; 148: 260-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The antibodies used for Western blotting are anti-p53 PAb122 (PharMingen, San Diego, CA), anti-phosphoserine 15 p53 peptide (2Shieh S.-Y. Ikeda M. Taya Y. Prives C. Cell. 1997; 91: 325-334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1754) Google Scholar), and anti-actin (C-11) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA). Cell extracts were prepared from mock-irradiated and irradiated MEFs at 2 h post-irradiation as described previously (17Peterson S.R. Stackhouse M. Waltman M.J. Chen F. Sato K. Chen D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10227-10231Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). DNA binding was analyzed by EMSA using the 32P-radiolabeled p53 consensus sequence 5′-AGCTTAGACATGCCTAGACATGCCAAGCT-3′. A typical binding reaction contained 1.5 μg of cell lysate, 0.25 μl of 0.1 mdithiothreitol, 1 μl of 32P-radiolabeled DNA (1 ng/μl), 1.2 μl of glycerol, 0.5 μl of PAb421 (Calbiochem), and Tris-buffered saline (25 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 130 mm NaCl, 3 mm KCl) to 10 μl final volume as described previously (7Woo R.A. McLure K.G. Lees-Miller S.P. Rancourt D.E. Lee P.W.K. Nature. 1998; 394: 700-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar, 20McLure K.G. Lee P.W.K. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3342-3350Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Reactions were incubated for 30–60 min at 23 °C and electrophoresed in a nondenaturing Tris borate-EDTA polyacrylamide gel. For quantitative RT-PCR, equal amounts of total RNA prepared from mock-irradiated or irradiated MEFs at 4 h post-irradiation were used for cDNA synthesis as described previously in this section. The cDNAs were then amplified for p21 through 15 PCR cycles using the primers 5′-CGGTCCCGTGGACAGTGAGCAG-3′ and 5′-GTCAGGCTGGTCTGCCTCCG-3′. The GAPDH primers GA-5 and GA-3, described previously in this section, were used as a normalizing control. PCR products were electrophoresed through a 2% Tris acetate-EDTA-agarose gel, transferred to Hybond-N+ nylon membranes (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and were hybridized with32P-radiolabeled probes specific to the amplified p21 or GAPDH fragments: 5′-CCCGAGAACGGTGGAACTTTGACTTCGTCA-3′ for p21 and 5′-AGTATGATGACATCAAGAAGGTGGTGAAGC-3′ for GAPDH. After hybridization, the blots were washed in buffer containing 0.5 × SSC and 0.1% SDS at 42 °C and autoradiographed. The autoradiographs were scanned and the bands quantified using NIH Image. Asynchronously growing control and irradiated MEFs were continuously labeled with 10 μm BrdUrd after 6 Gy of γ-irradiation. Cells were then harvested at 6 h post-irradiation and fixed in 80% ethanol. Fixed cells were simultaneously stained with Hoechst 33342 (HO) and mithramycin (MI) and analyzed by multiparameter flow cytometry (21Crissman H.A. Steinkamp J.A. Exp. Cell Res. 1987; 173: 256-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Cellular DNA content is proportional to the MI fluorescence and BrdUrd incorporation to the difference between the MI and HO fluorescence signal per cell (MI-HO). Bivariate histograms of MI-HOversus MI fluorescence were obtained for 2 × 104 events as described (21Crissman H.A. Steinkamp J.A. Exp. Cell Res. 1987; 173: 256-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Bivariate contour histograms in the figures were drawn with WinMDI v2.4 (Joseph Trotter, The Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, CA). We have generated DNA-PKcs-null mice by disrupting the DNA-PKcs gene by homologous recombination (16Kurimasa A. Ouyang H. Dong L.-J. Wang S. Li X. Cordon-Cardo C. Chen D.J. Li G.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1403-1408Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). MEFs were isolated from DNA-PKcs +/− and −/− sibling embryos. The genotype of the embryos was determined by PCR (16Kurimasa A. Ouyang H. Dong L.-J. Wang S. Li X. Cordon-Cardo C. Chen D.J. Li G.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1403-1408Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) that distinguishes endogenous from the disrupted DNA-PKcs allele (data not shown). The presence of intact DNA-PKcs transcripts in the +/− MEFs and its absence in the −/− MEFs was confirmed by reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR). RT-PCR products between exon 1 and exon 4 of DNA-PKcs were clearly absent in the −/− MEFs (Fig.1 A). Western blotting revealed the presence of equal amounts of DNA-PKcs protein in control and irradiated +/− MEFs, but no detectable protein in the −/− MEFs (Fig.1 B). The +/− and −/− MEFs were also characterized by low dose rate irradiation with 137Cs γ-rays (1.4 Gy/day for 10 days). After irradiation, the cells were allowed to recover for 10 days. While we observed growing DNA-PKcs +/− MEFs, no surviving DNA-PKcs −/− MEFs were observed after 10 days. DNA-PKcs +/− and −/− MEFs were grown to 80% confluence, irradiated, and harvested at 0, 2, 4, and 8 h post-irradiation. SDS extracts prepared from the irradiated cells were examined for p53 accumulation and phosphorylation by Western blotting using anti-p53 antibody and anti-phosphoserine 15 p53 peptide antibody. The anti-phosphoserine 15 antibody can recognize phosphorylated serine 15 of human p53, as well as the phosphorylated form of the homologous serine 18 of murine p53, but not unphosphorylated p53 (2Shieh S.-Y. Ikeda M. Taya Y. Prives C. Cell. 1997; 91: 325-334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1754) Google Scholar). We observed normal accumulation of p53 in response to IR in both DNA-PKcs +/− and −/− MEFs (Fig. 2, top panel). Serine 18 phosphorylation was more transient, lasting between 2 and 4 h, with maximum levels of phosphorylation at 2 h post-irradiation (Fig. 2, middle panel). Ser-18 phosphorylation of p53 was not impaired in the DNA-PKcs −/− MEFs. Moreover, both accumulation and phosphorylation of p53 were enhanced in the absence of DNA-PKcs. Cell extracts from mock-irradiated and irradiated DNA-PKcs +/− and −/− MEFs were assayed for p53 sequence-specific DNA binding by EMSA using double-stranded oligonucleotides bearing the consensus p53 DNA-binding motif (Fig. 3). Binding reactions were carried out in the presence of a specific anti-p53 antibody PAb421 that activates sequence-specific DNA binding by p53 (22Hupp T.R. Lane D.P. Curr. Biol. 1994; 4: 865-875Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). The bands indicated by an arrow in Fig. 3 represent sequence-specific DNA binding by p53 as they are not obtained in the absence of PAb421 (Fig. 3, lane 6) or in the presence of an unrelated antibody (Fig. 3, lane 7). Enhancement of sequence-specific DNA binding by p53 was observed upon irradiation of the +/− MEFs (Fig. 3, compare lanes 2 and 3) and also upon irradiation of the −/− MEFs (Fig. 3, compare lanes 4 and 5). Activated p53 can transactivate the cyclin-dependent-kinase inhibitor p21 (23Macleod K.F. Sherry N. Hannon G. Beach D. Tokino T. Kinzler K. Vogelstein B. Jacks T. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 935-944Crossref PubMed Scopus (745) Google Scholar). Therefore, in order to test whether the observed phosphorylation, accumulation and DNA binding of p53 corresponded to activation of transcription in vivo, we quantitated the induction of p21 messenger RNA upon irradiation of DNA-PKcs +/− and −/− MEFs by quantitative RT-PCR. We found that the +/− and −/− MEFs are indistinguishable with respect to the enhancement (4.5–5-fold) of p21 gene expression upon irradiation (Fig. 4, A andB). To investigate the effect, if any, of the absence of DNA-PKcs on the G1 cell cycle checkpoint, DNA-PKcs +/− and −/− MEFs were mock-irradiated or irradiated at 6.0 Gy and labeled with BrdUrd immediately after irradiation. BrdUrd incorporations at 6 h post-irradiation were quantified from multiparameter flow cytometry measurements (21Crissman H.A. Steinkamp J.A. Exp. Cell Res. 1987; 173: 256-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The bivariate contour histograms (Fig.5 A) depict the distributions of cells with different BrdUrd (MI-HO fluorescence) and DNA (MI fluorescence) contents in the control and irradiated cultures. By 6 h post-irradiation, cells were depleted from the S phase (boxed in Fig. 5 A) in both DNA-PKcs +/− and −/− cultures indicating induction of arrest at a G1checkpoint. The ratios of percentage of total cells in G1to percentage of total cells in S phase (percent cells in G1/percent cells in S) for control and irradiated cultures were plotted (Fig. 5 B). The extent of G1 arrest was comparable for the DNA-PKcs +/− and −/− cultures (Fig.5 B). In this paper we present evidence proving that DNA-PKcs is not essential for p53 activation and cell cycle arrest in response to IR. Upon irradiating DNA-PKcs-null MEFs, we observe normal p53 accumulation and serine 18 phosphorylation, sequence-specific DNA binding by p53, transactivation of p21 gene expression, and normal G1 cell cycle arrest in the absence of DNA-PKcs. Earlier reports on p53 activation in the absence of DNA-PKcs were based upon experiments with primary cells from SCID mice (9Huang L. Clarkin K.C. Wahl G.M. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 2940-2944PubMed Google Scholar, 10Guidos C.J. Williams C.J. Grandal I. Knowles G. Huang M.T. Danska J.S. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2038-2054Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar, 11Gurley K.E. Kemp C.J. Carcinogenesis. 1996; 17: 2537-2542Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 12Rathmell W.K. Kaufmann W.K. Hurt J.C. Byrd L.L. Chu G. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 68-74PubMed Google Scholar). However, primary SCID cells have been reported to retain residual DNA-PK kinase activity (7Woo R.A. McLure K.G. Lees-Miller S.P. Rancourt D.E. Lee P.W.K. Nature. 1998; 394: 700-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). This could be because the SCID mutation resides just downstream of the conserved kinase motifs of the DNA-PKcs gene resulting in a truncated product missing only 83 amino acid residues from the extreme carboxyl-terminal end (8Araki R. Fujimori A. Hamatani K. Mita K. Saito T. Mori M. Fukumura R. Morimyo M. Muto M. Itoh M. Tatsumi K. Abe M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2438-2443Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). In order to avoid the ambiguity associated with SCID cells, we established MEFs derived from DNA-PKcs-null mice as these cells are completely deficient in DNA-PKcs and, unlike many transformed cell lines, would not have mutations in p53. The DNA-PKcs-null mice, generated by disrupting the DNA-PKcs gene by homologous recombination, show severe immunodeficiency and radiation hypersensitivity (16Kurimasa A. Ouyang H. Dong L.-J. Wang S. Li X. Cordon-Cardo C. Chen D.J. Li G.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1403-1408Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Cells from the DNA-PKcs-null mice have no detectable DNA-PKcs protein or kinase activity (16Kurimasa A. Ouyang H. Dong L.-J. Wang S. Li X. Cordon-Cardo C. Chen D.J. Li G.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1403-1408Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). The DNA-PKcs +/− and −/− MEFs used for this study were extensively characterized with respect to DNA-PKcs status and phenotype by (i) PCR (for genotyping), (ii) RT-PCR (for confirming the presence of intact DNA-PKcs transcripts in the +/− but not in the −/− MEFs), (iii) Western blotting (for confirming the presence of DNA-PKcs protein in +/− MEFs and its absence in −/− MEFs), and (iv) low dose rate irradiation (only the −/− MEFs were susceptible). Phosphorylation of human p53 within its transactivation domain at serine 15 or murine p53 at serine 18 is an early and important step in the activation and accumulation of this protein in response to IR (24Prives C. Cell. 1998; 95: 5-8Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar). This phosphorylation event could contribute to both increased p53 half-life and increased transcriptional activity by decreasing the ability of the negative regulator Mdm2 to bind to p53 (2Shieh S.-Y. Ikeda M. Taya Y. Prives C. Cell. 1997; 91: 325-334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1754) Google Scholar). However, none of the earlier reports describing the involvement or noninvolvement of DNA-PK in p53 activation have focused on this phosphorylation event. Our results demonstrate that DNA-PKcs, unlike ATM, is not essential for the phosphorylation or accumulation of p53 in response to IR. It is interesting that phosphorylation and accumulation of p53 are actually enhanced in the DNA-PKcs −/− MEFs relative to the +/− MEFs. Our observations are consistent with those of Araki et al. 2R. Araki, R. Fukumura, A. Fujimori, Y. Taya, Y. Shiloh, A. Kurimasa, S. Burma, G. C. Li, D. J. Chen, K. Sato, Y. Hoki, K. Tatsumi, and M. Abe, submitted for publication. who observed a similar enhancement in transformed mouse cell lines with defective DNA-PKcs and with those of Gurley and Kemp (11Gurley K.E. Kemp C.J. Carcinogenesis. 1996; 17: 2537-2542Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) who observed a prolonged induction of p53 protein in the intestinal crypt cells of irradiated SCID mice. The ATM protein can bind to DNA ends like DNA-PKcs, and the p53 serine 15 kinase activity of ATM is stimulated by the presence of damaged DNA. 3G. C. M. Smith, R. B. Cary, N. D. Lakin, B. C. Hann, S.-H. Teo, D. J. Chen, and S. P. Jackson, submitted for publication. We speculate that in the absence of DNA-PKcs, ATM may have greater access to DNA DSBs as it no longer has to compete with DNA-PKcs for end binding. This, coupled with the persistence of DNA DSBs in the absence of DNA-PK, could result in enhanced activation of ATM, which may explain the enhanced phosphorylation and accumulation of p53 observed in the DNA-PKcs −/− MEFs. Our observations regarding induction of sequence-specific DNA binding by p53 upon irradiation of the DNA-PKcs −/− MEFs are not in agreement with those of Woo et al. (7Woo R.A. McLure K.G. Lees-Miller S.P. Rancourt D.E. Lee P.W.K. Nature. 1998; 394: 700-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar) who fail to detect any DNA binding using extracts from SCGR11 cells. This difference is possibly due to the fact that p53 from SCGR11 is mutated in its DNA-binding domain.2 The mutation is a “T” to “C” transversion resulting in a substitution of leucine at position 191 to arginine (DDBJ accession number AB021961). The vast majority of p53 missense mutations are clustered within the DNA-binding region and the inability of p53 from SCGR11 to bind to DNA would be due to the defect in its DNA-binding domain and not, as proposed by Woo et. al. (7Woo R.A. McLure K.G. Lees-Miller S.P. Rancourt D.E. Lee P.W.K. Nature. 1998; 394: 700-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar), due to the absence of DNA-PKcs in these cells. Woo et. al. (7Woo R.A. McLure K.G. Lees-Miller S.P. Rancourt D.E. Lee P.W.K. Nature. 1998; 394: 700-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar) also reported that cytoplasmic extracts from γ-irradiated M059J cells (that lack DNA-PKcs) could not activatein vitro–translated p53 for DNA binding (7Woo R.A. McLure K.G. Lees-Miller S.P. Rancourt D.E. Lee P.W.K. Nature. 1998; 394: 700-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). However, M059J cells also have drastically reduced levels of the ATM protein (25Chan D.W. Gately D.P. Urban S. Galloway A.M. Lees-Miller S.P. Yen T. Allalunis-Turner J. Int. J. Radiat. Biol. 1998; 74: 217-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The ATM protein is essential for p53 activation upon irradiation and the lack of p53 activation by MO59J cytoplasmic extracts may not be due to the absence of DNA-PKcs but due to the reduced levels of ATM. p53 activation in response to IR leads to transactivation of the cyclin-dependent-kinase inhibitor p21 and G1cell cycle arrest (24Prives C. Cell. 1998; 95: 5-8Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar). In order to correlate the observed p53 accumulation, phosphorylation, and DNA binding with its activation as a transcription factor, we looked at the induction of p21 gene expression upon irradiation and the integrity of the G1 cell cycle checkpoint in the DNA-PKcs −/− MEFs. We found that the DNA-PKcs +/− and −/− MEFs are indistinguishable with regard to fold induction of p21 gene transcription upon irradiation. We also found that both DNA-PK +/− and −/− cultures arrested in the G1 phase of the cell cycle by 6 h post-irradiation. These results are consistent with earlier reports of normal p21 gene induction and cell cycle arrest in primary SCID cells (9Huang L. Clarkin K.C. Wahl G.M. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 2940-2944PubMed Google Scholar, 10Guidos C.J. Williams C.J. Grandal I. Knowles G. Huang M.T. Danska J.S. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2038-2054Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar, 11Gurley K.E. Kemp C.J. Carcinogenesis. 1996; 17: 2537-2542Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 12Rathmell W.K. Kaufmann W.K. Hurt J.C. Byrd L.L. Chu G. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 68-74PubMed Google Scholar). Our observations involving DNA-PKcs −/− MEFs indicate unequivocally that DNA-PKcs, unlike the related ATM protein, is not essential for the activation of p53 and G1 cell cycle arrest in response to ionizing radiation. An alternate interpretation could be that DNA-PKcs is still involved in p53 activation, as suggested by in vitro experiments (2Shieh S.-Y. Ikeda M. Taya Y. Prives C. Cell. 1997; 91: 325-334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1754) Google Scholar, 5Lees-Miller S.P. Sakaguchi K. Ullrich S.J. Appella E. Anderson C.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5041-5049Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar, 6Wang Y. Eckhart W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 4231-4235Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), but the loss of DNA-PKcs activity is concealed by the presence of other p53-dependent pathways like the one involving ATM. In this regard, it should be noted that AT cells have mutated ATM protein but contain wild type DNA-PKcs. So, if DNA-PKcs were to play a major role in p53 activation, then p53 phosphorylation in A-T cells would not be significantly reduced and delayed (1Siliciano J.D. Canman C.E. Taya Y. Sakaguchi K. Appella E. Kastan M.B. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3471-3481Crossref PubMed Scopus (711) Google Scholar). Therefore, while DNA-PKcs is involved in the repair of DNA DSBs (4Jackson S.P. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1997; 29: 935-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 17Peterson S.R. Stackhouse M. Waltman M.J. Chen F. Sato K. Chen D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10227-10231Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), our experiments clearly rule out an essential role for DNA-PKcs in the activation of a p53-mediated DNA damage signaling pathway.

Binding of cardiac troponin I-(1–80) decreases conformational exchange for residues 29, 32, and 34. Comparison of average transverse cross correlation rates show that both the NH2- and COOH-terminal domains of cardiac troponin C tumble with similar correlation times when bound to cardiac troponin I-(1–80). In contrast, the NH2- and COOH-terminal domains in free cardiac troponin C and cardiac troponin C bound cardiac troponin I-(1–80)DD tumble independently. These results suggest that the nonphosphorylated cardiac specific NH2 terminus of cardiac troponin I interacts with the NH2-terminal domain of cardiac troponin C.

These results suggest that the nonphosphorylated cardiac specific NH2 terminus of cardiac troponin I interacts with the NH2-terminal domain of cardiac troponin C. Troponin C (TnC) 1The abbreviations used are: Tn, troponin; cTnC, recombinant cardiac troponin C (desMet1-Ala2, C35S); sTnC, skeletal TnC; cTnI, cardiac troponin I; PKA, cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase A; NOESY-HSQC, nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy-heteronuclear single quantum coherence; CSA, chemical shift anisotropy is the Ca2+ binding component of the troponin complex that is required to confer Ca2+ sensitivity on the actin-myosin interaction. The troponin complex consists of three proteins: troponin I (TnI), which inhibits the actomyosin Mg2+-ATPase; TnC, which removes TnI inhibition triggering the Mg2+-ATPase; and TnT, which makes primary protein-protein contacts with tropomyosin. The cardiac isoforms of TnC and TnI differ significantly from skeletal isoforms. In the cardiac isoform of TnC, Ca2+ binding site I, comprising residues 28 through 40, is naturally inactive (1Van Eerd J.P. Takahashi K. Carafoli E. Clement E. Drabikowski W. Margreth A. Calcium Transport in Contraction and Secretion. Elsevier Science Publishing Co., Inc., New York1976: 427-430Google Scholar). Residues 65 through 76 form the regulatory calcium binding site II. The cardiac isoform of TnI is unique in that it contains an additional NH2-terminal extension of approximately 32 residues. This extension contains two adjacent serine residues that can be phosphorylated by PKA. Phosphorylation has been demonstrated to modulate myofilament sensitivity to Ca2+ by reducing Ca2+ affinity for the NH2-terminal regulatory site of cTnC (2Robertson S.P. Johnson J.D. Holroyde M.J. Kranias E.G. Potter J.D. Solaro R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 260-263Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The reduction in the sensitivity of myofilament force development to Ca2+ induced by phosphorylation of cTnI can be mimicked by exchange of the native unphosphorylated cTnI with cTnI-DD, in which Ser23 and Ser24 have been mutated to Asp (3Dohet C. Al-Hillawi E. Trayer I.P. Ruegg J.C. FEBS Lett. 1995; 377: 131-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Cardiac TnI-DD is also able to mimic effects of phosphorylation on the steady-state and pre-steady-state binding of cTnI to cTnC (4Reiffert S.U. Jaquet K. Heilmeyer L.M. Herberg F.W. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 13516-13525Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Cardiac TnC and TnI are known to interact in an antiparallel manner such that the COOH-terminal domain of TnC interacts with the NH2-terminal domain of TnI (5Krudy G.A. Kleerekoper Q. Guo X. Howarth J.W. Solaro R.J. Rosevear P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23731-23735Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Conformational changes induced by Ca2+ binding to the NH2-terminal domain of skeletal TnC (sTnC) have been followed by both x-ray (6Herzberg O. Moult J. James M.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 2638-2644Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and solution NMR (7Gagne S.M. Li M.X. McKay R.T. Sykes B.D. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1998; 76: 302-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). For the free skeletal TnC protein, Ca2+ binding results in a conformational change from the “closed” form to an “open” form exposing a patch of hydrophobic residues for interaction with TnI (7Gagne S.M. Li M.X. McKay R.T. Sykes B.D. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1998; 76: 302-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, the Ca2+-bound NH2-terminal domain of cTnC was found to maintain a closed conformation (8Sia K.S. Li M.X. Spyracopoulos L. Gagne M. Liu W. Putkey J.A. Sykes B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18216-18221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). The solution structure of the Ca2+ saturated regulatory domain of human cTnC, cTnC-(1–91), in 9% trifluoroethanol, also reveals a “closed” conformation with little exposed hydrophobic surface (9Pääkkönen K. Annila A. Sorsa T. Pollesello P. Tilgmann C. Kilpeläinen I. Karisola P. Ulmanen I. Drakenberg T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15633-15638Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In addition, 15N relaxation studies on human cTnC-(1–91) suggested conformational exchange for Val28, Thr38, Lys39, Ile61, and Val64. The authors suggest the origin of this conformational exchange results from exchange between the closed form and a low population of the open form. However, monomer-dimer exchange could not unequivocally be ruled out. To elucidate the role of phosphorylation of the cardiac-specific amino terminus of cTnI on full-length cTnC and to unequivocally demonstrate the presence of conformational exchange in the regulatory domain of full-length cTnC, we have probed the dynamics of cTnC free and bound to cTnI-(1–80) and cTnI-(1–80)DD. We show that residues within inactive Ca2+ binding site I undergo chemical exchange consistent with an equilibrium between closed and opened forms both in the presence and absence of the NH2-terminal cTnI domain. Based on chemical shift perturbation mapping and transverse relaxation rates, the cardiac-specific NH2 terminus of cTnI-(1–80) appears to make additional interactions with the regulatory domain of cTnC, which results in slowing down the exchange rate in the defunct Ca2+ binding site I as evidenced by the presence of1H-15N cross-peaks representing two distinct conformations for Leu29, Glu32, and Gly34. These interactions were not observed in the free protein or in the complex with cTnI-(1–80)DD. The single cysteine form of cTnC (cTnC35S) was used in the study (10Putkey J.A. Dotson D.G. Mouawad P.

Cardiac troponin C was purified as described previously (5Krudy G.A. Kleerekoper Q. Guo X. Howarth J.W. Solaro R.J. Rosevear P.R. J. Biol.

Complex formation for cTnC·cTnI-(1–80) and cTnC·cTnI-(1–80)DD was carried out as described previously (5Krudy G.A. Kleerekoper Q. Guo X. Howarth J.W. Solaro R.J. Rosevear P.R. J. Biol.

Samples of 1.0 mmconcentration were prepared in 10% 2H2O, 20 mm Tris-d11 buffer (pH = 6.8), 150 mm potassium chloride, 10 mm Ca 2+, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 10 mmdithiothreitol. All samples contained 0.2 mm leupeptin and 0.4 mm pefablock to prevent protein degradation. All experiments were carried out on Varian Inova 600 or 800 MHz spectrometers. Amide 1H and15N resonances of cTnC were obtained by means of heteronuclear triple resonance NMR experiments. 3N. Finley, unpublished data. To confirm the assignments for cTnC bound to cTnI-(1–80) and cTnI-(1–80)DD,1H-15N NOESY-HSQC experiments with mixing times of 85 and 200 ms were performed at 800 MHz. The 15NR 2 and dipolar CSA interference experiments were performed on Ca2+-saturated [2H,15N]cTnC free and bound to either cTnI-(1–80) or cTnI-(1–80)DD. For all experiments, the spectral widths in t1 and t2 dimensions were 2.00 and 15.62 kHz, respectively. The 1H carrier was set to the frequency of the water resonance at 4.77 ppm. The number of transients used inR 2 and Iauto transverse cross-correlation experiments was 16, while Icrosstransverse cross-correlation experiments were performed with 48 transients. 15N dipolar CSA interference experiments were performed as described by Kroenke et al.

Relaxation delays used for the transverse cross-correlation rate (ηxy) measurements were 0.0320, 0.0534, 0.0748, 0.0961, and 0.1068 s. The R 2 experiments were performed with recovery delays of 0.000, 0.032, 0.064, 0.096, 0.128, 0.160, 0.192, and 0.224 s as described previously (14Farrow N.A. Muhandiram R. Singer A.U. Pascal S.M.

Double points were collected with recovery delays of 0.032, 0.128, and 0.192 s to estimate the uncertainties. NMR data was processed using Felix 97.2 (MSI). Free induction decays were apodized with a skewed sine bell 90° function. Generally, peak heights were measured using Felix routines. For the transverse cross-correlation experiments Icross/Iauto intensity ratios were normalized for the number of transients used in each experiment. Curve-fits for transverse relaxation and cross-correlation rates were performed using the CURVEFIT software (13Palmer III, A.G. Rance M. Wright P.E. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1991; 113: 4371-4380Crossref Scopus (598) Google Scholar). To compare interactions of cTnI-(1–80) and cTnI-(1–80)DD with cTnC, 1H and 15N chemical shift differences of bound cTnC were analyzed. Chemical shift differences for amide1H and 15N resonances observed between the two complexes are presented in Fig. 1. These chemical shift differences can be used to map to binding site of cTnI-(1–80) on the regulatory domain of cTnC. In addition, analysis of chemical shift differences between free cTnC and cTnC bound to cTnC·cTnI-(1–80) or cTnC·cTnI-(1–80)DD reveals that both proteins bind predominantly to the COOH-terminal domain of cTnC causing a conformational change, as was observed for cTnI-(33–80) binding to cTnC-(81–161). 4Gasmi-Seabrook, G.

Taken together, these results allow us to propose that both nonphosphorylated and phosphorylated forms of cTnI bind to the COOH-terminal domain of cTnC with the nonphosphorylated form making limited contacts with the NH2-terminal domain of cTnC. It is also apparent that binding of the nonphosphorylated NH2-terminal domain of cTnI causes only minor structure perturbations in the NH2-terminal domain of cTnC. 1H-15N correlation NMR spectroscopy was used to study the interactions of cTnC with TnI-(1–80) and TnI-(1–80)DD. Residues excluded from the analysis due to peak overlap, even at 800 MHz, in the 1H-15N correlation spectra of cTnC bound to cTnI-(1–80) or cTnI-(1–80)DD are listed in Fig.2. In the cTnC·cTnI-(1–80)DD complex, cross-peaks for cTnC residues 38 and 39 were broadened beyond detection. Cross-peaks for residues 24, 28, 36, 37, 38, 39, and 40 were broadened beyond detection in the cTnC·cTnI-(1–80) complex. To further investigate interactions between the regulatory domain of cTnC and the NH2-terminal domain of cTnI, 15N transverse relaxation and 1H-15N diploar/15N CSA cross-correlation rates were measured at 800 MHz on [2H,15N]cTnC free and bound to cTnI-(1–80) and cTnI-(1–80)DD. Perdeuteration offered an opportunity to obtain precise relaxation parameters and enhanced spectral resolution. Data analysis was performed as described under “Materials and Methods.” The experimental values for R 2obtained at 800 MHz on cTnC·cTnI-(1–80), cTnC·cTnI-(1–80)DD, and free cTnC are depicted in Fig. 2. Not surprisingly, lowR 2 values for flexible NH2 and COOH termini of cTnC free and bound are observed. It is also apparent that Met85 through Thr93 in the linker region of cTnC free and cTnI bound exhibit reduced R 2values. In addition, Ala30 through Ser35 in the inactive calcium binding site I of cTnC bound to cTnI-(1–80) or cTnI-(1–80)DD exhibit reduced R 2 values. This fact is indicative of increased mobility in these regions. Elevated R 2 relaxation rates are found for Val28, Ile36, and Ser37 in both free cTnC and cTnC bound to cTnI-(1–80)DD (Fig. 2 B).R 2 relaxation rates could not be obtained for these residues in the cTnC·cTnI-(1–80) complex due to extreme broadening of 1H-15N cross-peaks in HSQC spectra recorded for the R 2 measurements. This broadening may best be explained by the possibility that these residues are engaged in slow conformational exchange. To prove the existence of conformational exchange in the inactive Ca2+ binding site I of cTnC, measurements of1H-15N dipolar/15N CSA transverse (ηxy) cross-correlation rates were carried out. These cross-correlation rates do not depend on chemical exchange effects and are directly proportional to the generalized order parameters (15Tjandra N. Szabo A. Bax A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996; 118: 6986-6991Crossref Scopus (320) Google Scholar). Therefore, the ηxy values are sensitive only to internal and overall motions (12Kroenke C.D. Loria J.P. Lee L.K. Rance M. Palmer III, A.G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1998; 120: 7905-7915Crossref Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 16Tjandra N. Feller S.E. Pastor R.W. Bax A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995; 117: 12562-12566Crossref Scopus (670) Google Scholar). The transverse cross-correlation rates are also presented in Fig. 2. In general, the transverse cross-correlation rates repeat the same trend asR 2 values. However, for residues Val28, Ile36, and Ser37 the cross-correlation values are not increased like theR 2 relaxation rates in this region. Thus, the results of these experiments prove that residues adjacent to the calcium binding site I undergo conformational exchange in free cTnC and when bound to cTnI-(1–80)DD. Conformational exchange in Val28, Ile36, and Ser37 is slower when cTnC is bound to cTnI-(1–80), since these residues have broadened beyond detection. In support of this, multiple resonances for Leu29, Glu32, and Gly34 of cTnC were observed in the complex with cTnI-(1–80) (Fig. 3). Careful analysis of NOESY-HSQC spectra revealed that both cross-peaks for each residue have NOEs to the same amide protons. In the case of Leu29 and Gly34, mutual sequential NOEs are observed to Gly30 (Fig. 3 A) and Asp33 (Fig. 3 B), respectively. These results allowed us to suggest that the new cross-peaks represent a different conformation for the defunct Ca2+ binding site I of cTnC. The resonance for Glu32 also appears to consist of multiple peaks, but HN-HN NOEs for Glu32could not be observed in the recorded NOESY-HSQC spectra. Thus, we are unable to unequivocally assign both cross-peaks to Glu32. Cross-peaks for Leu29, Glu32, and Gly34 are well resolved, and it is unlikely that the new peaks belong to some other unassigned amide protons experiencing extremely large chemical shift perturbations and having identicali to i + 1 NOEs. It seems possible that cTnI-(1–80) binds to the NH2-terminal domain of cTnC and slows down chemical exchange in defunct Ca2+ binding site I, presumably changing the dynamic equilibrium between open and closed conformations. On average, the R 2 values for the COOH-terminal domain of the free protein are smaller than those values for the NH2-terminal domain (Fig. 2 C). This can be attributed to the fact that the NH2-terminal domain of cTnC is slightly larger than the COOH-terminal domain. The averageR 2 value for the COOH-terminal domain, comprising residues 104 through 135, was 11.0 ± 1.9 s−1, while the average R 2 value for the NH2 terminus, comprising residues 14 through 23 and residues 41 through 80, was 14.6 ± 1.6 s−1. The linker region, the NH2 and COOH termini, and inactive calcium binding site I were excluded from this analysis on the basis of either increased mobility or possible conformational exchange in these regions. When cTnC is bound to cTnI-(1–80)DD the averageR 2 value (20.0 ± 1.9 s−1) for the COOH-terminal domain is larger than the averageR 2 value for the NH2-terminal domain (16.0 ± 1.8 s−1) as shown in Fig. 2 B. This difference could be explained by the fact that the NH2terminus of cTnI binds to the COOH terminus of cTnC (5Krudy G.A. Kleerekoper Q. Guo X. Howarth J.W. Solaro R.J. Rosevear P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23731-23735Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, for the cTnC·cTnI-(1–80) complex both the NH2- and COOH-terminal domains have similar average R 2values, (30.3 ± 2.9 s−1) and (31.6 ± 2.1 s−1), respectively (Fig. 2 A). A possible explanation of this phenomenon is that the NH2 terminus of the nonphosphorylated form of cTnI also makes contacts with the NH2-terminal domain of cTnC. The two domains of cTnC which are connected by a flexible linker tumble independently, with different rotational correlation times, in both the free protein and in a complex with cTnI-(1–80)DD. This results in different 15N R 2 values for the two domains of cTnC. Binding of cTnI-(1–80) to both the NH2- and COOH-terminal domains of cTnC reduces the possibility of independent tumbling of the two domains, which results in more uniform rotational correlation times across the molecule and subsequently in similar 15N transverse relaxation rates. Interaction of cTnI-(1–80) with both domains of Ca2+-saturated cTnC does not preclude flexibility in the linker region as is observed in the complex (Fig. 2 A). The solution structure for cardiac troponin C unexpectedly revealed a closed conformation for the regulatory domain of cardiac TnC (8Sia K.S. Li M.X. Spyracopoulos L. Gagne M. Liu W. Putkey J.A. Sykes B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18216-18221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). In this regard, the Ca2+-saturated cardiac isoform of TnC differs from the Ca2+-saturated skeletal isoform, which is in the open state (7Gagne S.M. Li M.X. McKay R.T. Sykes B.D. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1998; 76: 302-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The authors suggest that the functional form of Ca2+- saturated cTnC could be the closed form. However, based on relaxation studies performed on the isolated NH2-terminal domain of human cTnC, it has been suggested that the regulatory domain exists in two conformations: open and closed (9Pääkkönen K. Annila A. Sorsa T. Pollesello P. Tilgmann C. Kilpeläinen I. Karisola P. Ulmanen I. Drakenberg T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15633-15638Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The results of our experiments demonstrate that chemical exchange does occur in the defunct Ca2+ binding site I in both intact free cTnC and cTnC bound to the NH2-terminal domain of cTnI. Thus, the regulatory domain of cTnC may be in equilibrium between a closed and open form both free in solution and when it is bound to the phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated forms of the NH2-terminal domain of cTnI. This argument is supported by the presence of conformational exchange as evidenced by differences in the R 2 values and transverse cross-correlation rates for Val28, Ile36, and Ser37in the inactive Ca2+ binding site I. Taken together, our studies suggest that when cTnI is phosphorylated, the regulatory domain of cTnC is destabilized, resulting in a decrease in Ca2+affinity. This would explain the enhanced relaxation observed when cTnI is phosphorylated by PKA in response to β-adrenergic stimulation of the heart (17Solaro R.J. Rarick H.M. Circ. Res. 1998; 83: 471-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). Binding of the nonphosphorylated form of cTnI does not prevent chemical exchange in inactive calcium binding site I of cTnC. We propose, based on chemical shift mapping, R 2values, and the presence of multiple cross-peaks for certain residues in defunct Ca2+ binding site I that nonphosphorylated cTnI interacts with both domains of cTnC and decreases chemical exchange presumably changing the dynamic equilibrium between open and closed conformations (8Sia K.S.

Strynadka N.C.J. James M.N.N. Rosevear P.R. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 10236-10245Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The fact that the transverse relaxation rates for the NH2 terminus of cTnC are not increased upon binding cTnI-(1–80)DD provides strong evidence that the phosphorylated mimetic of cTnI binds only to the COOH terminus of cTnC. This interpretation is in agreement with the fact that there are no significant amide proton and amide nitrogen chemical shift differences in the NH2-terminal domain of cTnC upon binding of cTnI-(1–80)DD. The crystal structure of sTnC complexed with a fragment of sTnI that corresponds to cardiac TnI-(33–80) clearly shows that sTnI interacts with both the NH2 and COOH termini of TnC (19Vassylyev D.G. Takeda S. Wakatsuki S. Maeda K. Maeda Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4847-4852Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Specifically, the A-helix of sTnC makes several contacts with the NH2-terminal portion of sTnI-(1–47) (19Vassylyev D.G. Takeda S. Wakatsuki S. Maeda K. Maeda Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4847-4852Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). We have shown recently that the solution structure of cTnC-(81–161) bound to cTnI-(33–80) is similar to that of sTnC bound to sTnI-(1–47). General agreement between sTnC and cTnC bound TnI structures suggest a common binding motif for the Ca2+/Mg2+-dependent interaction site in the TnI·TnC complex. It now appears that in the absence of phosphorylation, the Ca2+/Mg2+-dependent interaction site of cTnI makes additional contacts with the regulatory domain of cTnC similar to those interactions observed in the crystal structure for sTnC·sTnI-(1–47) (19Vassylyev D.G. Takeda S. Wakatsuki S. Maeda K. Maeda Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4847-4852Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Data presented here are all consistent with this hypothesis. It is intriguing to speculate that loss of these interactions are responsible for a decrease in calcium affinity in Ca2+ binding site II of cTnC when cTnI is phosphorylated. However, the exact sequence of events in this process is not understood and requires further investigation. This study provides the first structural and dynamic insight on the mechanism by which PKA phosphorylation of cTnI, in response to β-adrenergic stimulation of the myocyte, produces a decrease in the calcium affinity of the regulatory site in cTnC. The proposed mechanism utilizes the unique cardiac isoform differences found in both TnC and TnI. Knowledge of this mechanism provides the basis for molecular approaches aimed at modifying cardiac muscle contraction.

The canine transporter mediating cellular accumulation of the osmolyte betaine and the neurotransmitter γ-aminobutyric acid (BGT-1) was expressed inXenopus oocytes and analyzed by two-electrode voltage clamp and tracer flux studies. Exposure of oocytes expressing BGT-1 to betaine or γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) depolarized the cell membrane in the current clamp mode and induced an inward current under voltage clamp conditions. At 1 mm substrate the induced currents decreased in the following order: betaine = GABA > diaminobutyric acid = β-alanine > proline = quinidine > dimethylglycine > glycine > sarcosine. Both the V max and K m of GABA- and betaine-induced currents were voltage-dependent, and GABA- and betaine-induced currents and radioactive tracer uptake were strictly Na+-dependent but only partially dependent on the presence of Cl−. The apparent affinity of GABA decreased with decreasing Na+ concentrations. TheK m of Na+ also depended on the GABA and Cl− concentration. A decrease of the Cl−concentration reduced the apparent affinity for Na+ and GABA, and a decrease of the Na+ concentration reduced the apparent affinity for Cl− and GABA. A comparison of22Na+-, 36Cl−-, and14C-labeled GABA and 14C-labeled betaine fluxes and GABA- and betaine-induced currents yielded a coupling ratio of Na+/Cl−/organic substrate of 3:1:1 or 3:2:1. Based on the data, a transport model of ordered binding is proposed in which GABA binds first, Na+ second, and Cl−third.

Because osmotic equilibrium across most cell membranes occurs rapidly via water flux down its gradient, cells regulate their volume by adjusting their solute content. To this end they employ a variety of mechanisms including ion transport, formation or degradation of glycogen and proteins, as well as accumulation of organic osmolytes (1Lang F. Busch G.L. Ritter M.

Biochem. 1998; 8: 1-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). The osmolytes most frequently utilized by mammalian cells include the polyols sorbitol and myo-inositol, amino acids and amino acid derivatives such as taurine, as well as methylamines such as glycerophosphorylcholine and betaine (3Burg M.B. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: F983-F996Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Handler J.S. Kwon H.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: C1449-C1455Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast to inorganic ions, the organic osmolytes do not destabilize proteins and are thus compatible with cellular protein function even at very high concentrations (5Burg M.B. J. Exp.

Whereas sorbitol and glycerophosphorylcholine are accumulated by cellular formation, myo-inositol, taurine, and betaine are largely accumulated by Na+-coupled transport processes (4Handler J.S.

Methods Cell Biol. 1991; 36: 657-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar)). Uptake was initiated by addition of 100 μl of OR2+ buffer supplemented with 1 mmGABA and one of the radioactive substrates [14C]GABA, [14C]betaine (final specific activity 63.0 Bq/nmol), or22NaCl (final specific activity 21.9 Bq/nmol). Chloride uptake was studied in transport buffer in which unlabeled NaCl was replaced by H36Cl (final specific activity 6.7 Bq/nmol) titrated with NaOH to a pH of about 8; in addition, the HEPES concentration was elevated to 20 mm to increase buffering capacity. Groups of seven oocytes were incubated for each experimental condition in 5-ml polypropylene tubes containing 100 μl of supplemented OR2+ buffer. Uptake was stopped after 30 min or 1 h by washing the oocytes with ice-cold OR2+buffer. Single oocytes were lysed by adding 200 μl of 10% SDS; 3 ml of scintillation fluid was added, and radioactivity was determined by liquid scintillation counting. Each measurement was performed at least twice. Current induced by GABA was measured by two-electrode voltage clamp on the same batch of oocytes and on the same day the transport measurements were performed. Two-electrode voltage clamp recordings were performed at a holding potential of −50 mV if not otherwise specified. The data were filtered at 10 Hz and recorded with MacLab digital-to-analog converter and software for data acquisition and analysis (AD Instruments, Castle Hill, Australia). The external control solution (superfusate/ND96) contained 96 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2and 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.4. For experiments studying the dependence on external sodium or chloride, sodium was replaced by choline or N-methyl-d-glucamine and chloride by gluconate, NO3−, or SO42−. When necessary, the osmolarity was adjusted by adding glucose. Betaine or GABA was added to the solutions at the indicated concentrations. The final solutions were titrated to the pH indicated using HCl or KOH. The flow rate of the superfusion was 20 ml/min, and a complete exchange of the bath solution was reached within about 10 s. The currents given are the maximal values measured during a 30-s substrate superfusion. Usually the maximal current was reached after 25 substrate superfusion. To rule out effects of the different solution used (OR2+ versus ND96) control experiments were performed, and currents and uptake were measured under both conditions. No significant difference was found. Data are provided as means ± S.E., and n represents the number of oocytes investigated. The magnitude of the induced currents varied 2–5-fold, depending on the time period after cRNA injection and on the batch of oocytes (from different animals). Therefore, throughout the paper we show experimental data obtained on the same day for each specific set of experiments. All experiments were repeated with at least two or three batches of oocytes; in all repetitions qualitatively similar data were obtained. All data were tested for significance using the paired Student's t test, and only results with p < 0.05 were considered statistically significant. In current clamp studies superfusion of BGT-1 expressingXenopus oocytes with 1 mm GABA or betaine caused a depolarization of 27.6 ± 2.0 mV (n = 5) and 24.2 ± 1.7 mV (n = 5), respectively. In the voltage clamp modus 1 mm GABA or betaine induced a mean inward current of −73.9 ± 3.8 nA and −75.3 ± 4.1 nA, respectively, as illustrated in Fig.1 A. In noninjected control oocytes GABA did not induce significant currents (0.9 ± 0.3 nA, n = 5), whereas betaine led to an inward current of −7.2 ± 1.5 nA (n = 5). The betaine-induced current in noninjected oocytes was independent of the presence of Na+ and had a low affinity for betaine (data not shown). Thus, for further kinetic analysis mostly GABA was used; and if betaine was used, betaine-induced currents in noninjected oocytes were subtracted from the currents obtained from BGT-1-injected oocytes. To test the selectivity of BGT-1 the current elicited by a 1 mm concentration of different substrates was measured (Table I). The rank order of magnitude of induced currents was GABA = betaine > DABA > β-alanine > proline > quinidine > glycine = putrescine > choline > sarcosine = tetraethylammonium = taurine = carnitine > betaine aldehyde = creatine (Table I; all substances were tested on the same oocytes, n = 5). Among those substrates, only betaine induced currents in noninjected oocytes (see above). Serotonin, histamine, noradrenaline, dopamine, and l-DOPA did not induce any currents in BGT-1- or noninjected oocytes (data not shown,n = 5).Table ISubstrates and specificity of BGT-1Mean values ± S.E. of substrate-induced currents in BGT-1-expressing oocytes are shown.

Substrates were added at a concentration of 1 mm and at a holding potential of −50 mV for a period of 30 s. Not shown are serotonin, histamine, dopamine, l-DOPA, and noradrenaline, which did not induce any currents. In noninjected oocytes no currents were found for all substrates tested. TEA, tetraethylammonium. As shown in Fig. 1 B, the GABA-induced currents in BGT-1-expressing oocytes were voltage-dependent, increasing with hyperpolarization. In ND96 buffer the GABA-induced currents were strictly inwardly rectifying in the range between −90 and +40 mV (n = 5). The holding potential affected both the maximum velocity and the apparent K m of GABA- and betaine-induced currents. As shown in Fig.2 the GABA concentration required for half-maximal current (apparent K m) increased from 0.009 ± 0.001 mm at −100 mV holding potential to 0.031 ± 0.004 mm at a more depolarized holding potential of −30 mV. On the other hand, a depolarization from −100 to −50 and −30 mV decreased the maximal current by 31 ± 2% and 51 ± 2%, respectively (Fig. 2 A, n = 4). The apparent K m for betaine-induced currents was shifted significantly from 0.51 ± 0.04 mm at −80 mV holding potential to 2.1 ± 0.2 mm at −30 mV (n = 4). The maximal betaine-induced current was not significantly altered by depolarization (Fig. 2 B). The betaine-induced currents were strictly Na+- and partially Cl−-dependent. The apparentK m for Na+ was 93.3 ± 3.9 mm and for Cl− 68.3 ± 0.8 mm(n = 5, Fig. 3,A and B). The Hill coefficient for Na+ was 2.5 ± 0.2 and for Cl− 1.7 ± 0.1. Also, the GABA-induced currents were strictly Na+-dependent. In the absence of Na+, the addition of 1 mm GABA failed to induce any current. The GABA (1 mm)-induced current increased with the extracellular Na+ concentration (at 103.6 mm Cl− concentration) with a half-maximal current at 65.9 ± 8 mm Na+ concentration at −90 mV and at 89 ± 3 mm Na+concentration at −50 mV (Fig.4 A, n = 4). Thus, hyperpolarization of the cell membrane increased the affinity of the carrier to Na+. The Hill coefficient for Na+ was 2.2 ± 0.4 at −50 mV and was not altered significantly by hyperpolarization to −90 mV. A decrease of ambient Na+ concentration decreased both maximal current and apparent affinity for GABA. The apparent K m for GABA increased slightly from 0.021 ± 0.002 mm at 130 mm Na+ in the superfusate to 0.056 ± 0.006 mm at 80 mm Na+ (Fig.4 B). The Hill coefficient, however, remained close to 1. To test whether GABA influences Na+ binding, the GABA concentration was decreased from 1 to 0.03 mm, which markedly shifted the apparent affinity for Na+ from 55 ± 2 mm to about 120 mm without affecting the Hill coefficient or the calculated V max value (Fig. 5, n = 5).Figure 5GABA influences Na+binding. Panel A, Na+ kinetics with 1 mm or 0.03 mm GABA. The apparentK m for Na+ was shifted from 55 ± 2 mm under 1 mm GABA to about 120 mmunder 0.03 mm GABA. Experiments were carried out at a holding potential of −80 mV (n = 5). Both curves were obtained by fitting the data to the Hill equation. The Hill coefficient was about 2 for both conditions. The calculatedV max value for 1 and 0.03 mm GABA was 1.1 ± 0.1. Panel B, Lineweaver-Burk plot for the same data.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) As illustrated in Fig. 6, GABA-induced currents were also partially Cl−-dependent. Reduction of extracellular Cl− from 150 to 0 mm reduced the GABA-induced current by about 80% at −90 mV and by 90% at −50 mV (Fig. 6, A and B). Replacing Cl− with anions other than gluconate (NO3− and SO42−) showed similar results. Varying the extracellular Cl− concentration revealed that the half-maximal current induced by 1 mm GABA was reached at 78 ± 4 mm Cl− concentration at −90 mV and at about 114 ± 5 mm Cl−concentration at −50 mV. For fitting the curves an offset (Cl−-independent GABA-induced current) of 0.2 and 0.08 for −90 and −50 mV, respectively, was assumed. The apparentK m for Cl− at a holding potential of −50 mV could only be estimated because saturating conditions could not be reached under experimental conditions (n = 5). The apparent Cl− affinity of the carrier was decreased by depolarization. The Hill coefficient for Cl− was close to 1 irrespective of the holding potential. Furthermore, a reduction of the extracellular Cl− concentration from 130 to 50 mm resulted in a slight increase of the apparentK m value for GABA from 0.033 ± 0.001 to 0.049 ± 0.003 mm, pointing to a small but significant decrease of GABA affinity (Fig. 6 C,n = 5). The maximum velocity of GABA uptake decreased significantly with decreasing Cl−concentration. To examine the mutual interaction of Na+ and Cl− we performed Na+ and Cl−kinetics at different Cl− and Na+concentrations, respectively (Fig. 7). The apparent K m for Na+ was shifted from 54 ± 3 mm at 150 mm Cl− to 82 ± 7 mm at 80 mm Cl−. The Hill coefficient was 2.5 ± 0.2 for both extracellular Cl− concentrations (Fig. 7 A, n= 5). On the other hand, a decrease of the ambient Na+concentration from 150 to 80 mm turned the apparentK m for Cl− from 72 ± 3 mm (Hill coefficient of 1.1 ± 0.2) into a nonsaturable chloride concentration dependence (Fig. 7 C,n = 5). A summary of the kinetic constants derived from these experiments is shown in TableII.Table IISummary of kinetic constantsVaried substrateApparentK mVoltageGABA concentrationNa+concentrationCl− concentrationmVmmmmmmGABA9 ± 1 μm−10096103.619 ± 1 μm−5096103.631 ± 4 μm−3096103.621 ± 2 μm−50130103.656 ± 6 μm−5080103.649 ± 3 μm−509613033 ± 1 μm−509650Na+66 ± 8 mm−90110089 ± 3 mm−50110055 ± 2 mm−801103.6Approx. 120 mm−800.03103.654 ± 3 mm−50115082 ± 7 mm−50180Cl−78 ± 4 mm−90196Nonsaturable−50180Approx. 114 mm−5019672 ± 3 mm−501150 Open table in a new tab To determine further the Na+ and Cl−dependence and coupling ratio we carried out uptake studies with radioactive [14C]GABA, 22Na+, and36Cl−. The uptake of GABA was linear over a time period of 30 min (Fig. 8). In agreement with GABA-induced currents, the uptake of labeled GABA was completely Na+-dependent (n = 7) but only partially Cl−-dependent (n = 7) (Table III). The cotransport stoichiometry in relation to GABA was 1:3.1 for Na+ and 1:1.3 for Cl− (TableIV). The addition of 10 mmbetaine to the incubation buffer resulted in a substrate-stimulated22Na uptake of 5.2 ± 1.2 nmol/h and a substrate-stimulated 36Cl uptake of 3.3 ± 0.7 nmol/h, reflecting a ratio of 3 Na+ to 1.9 Cl−. Because of the low specific activity of available tracer, the betaine uptake could not be evaluated properly in these experiments. Taken together, these data suggest a coupling ratio of 3:1:1 or 3:2:1 for Na+, Cl−, and organic substrate, respectively. This conclusion is supported further by the comparison of flux and current in the same batch of oocytes. In those oocytes currents of 29 ± 9 nA (n = 7) and 59 ± 6 nA (n = 7) have been determined for the Na+/GABA and the Cl−/GABA flux measurements, respectively. Electrophysiological experiments under conditions mimicking the flux experiments revealed that during current clamp, the addition of 1 mm GABA led to an initial depolarization (by 13.6 ± 1.0 mV, n = 9) followed by slow recovery of cell membrane potential (by 14.6 ± 1.1 mV, n = 9). At voltage clamp conditions, the GABA (1 mm)-induced current decreased by 12 ± 3% (n = 4). Correcting the measured current at −50 mV holding potential for altered voltage and current yielded a value of 1.0 ± 0.2 and 1.0 ± 0.1 nmol/h net charge transfer/nmol/h organic substrate transported (TableIII). The uncorrected values amount to 1.8 ± 0.3 and 1.7 ± 0.2.Table IIIIon dependence of GABA transport in BGT-1-expressing oocytesND96 buffer with the indicated modificationBGT-1-expressing oocytesNoninjected oocytespmol GABA/30 min/oocytepmol GABA/30 min/oocyteNone1,127 ± 7137 ± 3Na+-free53 ± 424 ± 1Cl−-free380 ± 1825 ± 1Uptake of [14C]GABA (1 mm) was determined under different ionic conditions.

This is the first demonstration that BGT-1 conveys electrogenic transport of betaine and GABA together with Na+ and Cl−. The substrate-induced currents in BGT-1-expressing oocytes parallel several transport properties defined previously (7Yamauchi A. Uchida S. Kwon H.M. Preston A.S. Robey R.B. Garcia-Perez A. Burg M.

In these studies it was observed that transport of betaine and GABA was inhibited by quinine, β-alanine, and DABA (7Yamauchi A. Uchida S. Kwon H.M. Preston A.S. Robey R.B. Garcia-Perez A. Burg M.

According to the present results quinine, β-alanine, and DABA are not only inhibitors of GABA transport (7Yamauchi A. Uchida S. Kwon H.M. Preston A.S. Robey R.B. Garcia-Perez A. Burg M. Handler J.S.

Methylated amines are accepted as well but with lower affinity, whereas guanidino groups are hardly recognized. A second negatively charged group is preferred but does not seem to be necessary. The substrate recognition also seems to be flexible with respect to the distance between both groups. As shown previously (7Yamauchi A. Uchida S. Kwon H.M. Preston A.S. Robey R.B. Garcia-Perez A.

Chem. 1992; 267: 17491-17493Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the substrate-induced current requires the presence of extracellular Na+ and Cl−. The Hill coefficients and comparison of the tracer fluxes clearly indicate a coupling ratio for 1 GABA or betaine with 3 Na+ions/transport cycle. For each GABA transported the carrier transports one or two Cl− ions. The data do not allow a clear discrimination between these two transport ratios. The Hill coefficient for Na+ above 2 is compatible with the binding of 3 Na+. A variable stoichiometry has been described for another member of the GABA transporter family, GAT-1 (21Cammack J.N. Neuron. 1994; 13: 949-960Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). An earlier report showed a coupling ratio of GABA:Na+:Cl−of 1:3:2 for the human betaine/GABA transporter (8Rasola A. Galietta L.J.V. Barone V. Romeo G. Bagnasco S. FEBS Lett. 1995; 373: 229-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). However, a nonsaturating GABA concentration was used and no saturation reached, both of which may influence the determination of the Hill coefficient for Cl− (8Rasola A. Galietta L.J.V. Barone V. Romeo G. Bagnasco S. FEBS Lett. 1995; 373: 229-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Also, nontransporter Na+ or Cl− currents or fluxes in BGT-1-expressing oocytes could influence the calculated stoichiometry but were not significantly different from noninjected control oocytes in our experiments (TableIII). The characteristics of the GABA/betaine transporter BGT-1 differ significantly from those of the well characterized neuronal GABA transporter GAT-1. First, no currents or radioactive fluxes of Na+ and Cl− are observed in the absence of GABA, although Na+ and Cl− are present (21Cammack J.N. Neuron. 1994; 13: 949-960Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar,22Cammack J.N. Schwartz E.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 723-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Second, GABA is cotransported with 3 Na+ instead of 2 (14Borden L.A. Neurochem. Int. 1996; 29: 335-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar, 18Guastella J. Nelson N. Nelson H. Czyzyk L. Keynan S. Miedel M.C. Davidson N. Lester H.A. Kanner B.I.

Neuron. 1993; 10: 177-188Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). The maximal amplitude and apparent K mof GABA- and betaine-induced currents were voltage-dependent but not the Hill coefficients for GABA, Na+, and Cl−. The currents were strictly inwardly rectifying as described for the GAT family (14Borden L.A. Neurochem. Int. 1996; 29: 335-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar, 19Kavanaugh M.P.

Depolarization of the cell membrane or a decrease of the GABA concentration strongly decreased the apparent Na+ affinity. Presumably the Na+ binding site is within the cell membrane and senses part of the electrical field. Hyperpolarization of the cell membrane favors entry of Na+ and thus increases the Na+ concentration at the binding site. We have tried to deduce the binding order from the effects of substrate and ion concentration on the maximum velocity (30.Stein, W. D. (1986) Academic Press, Orlando, FL.Google Scholar). Because binding usually is not rate-limiting for transport, the uptake velocity should be dictated by the number of fully occupied transporters. In an ordered binding mechanism maximum velocity can therefore be reached with saturating concentrations of the last binding substrate, even in the presence of subsaturating concentrations of earlier binding substrates (30.Stein, W. D. (1986) Academic Press, Orlando, FL.Google Scholar). The maximum velocity of GABA uptake decreases with decreasing Na+ and Cl− concentrations. On the other hand, the maximum transport current can still be reached at subsaturating GABA concentrations (see Fig. 5 B). This is indicated by the intersection of the straight lines on the y axis in Fig. 5 B. We therefore tentatively suggest that GABA binds prior to Na+. The significant Cl−-independent GABA transport that was visible in flux and electrophysiological studies can be explained best by assuming a limited translocation of the GABA·3Na+ transporter complex. Alternatively, cotransport of the replacement anions gluconate, NO3− or SO42− has to be assumed. However, in the face of the similar current in the presence of these completely different anions, this possibility is considered unlikely. It is very likely that binding of Cl− should occur after binding of Na+. Based on the presented data we propose a transport model of ordered binding (Fig. 9) in which GABA or betaine binds first to the extracellular side of the transporter. Na+ binding occurs after GABA/betaine but before Cl− binding. Cl− facilitates the translocation of the transporter, but there is a substantial transport rate even in the absence of extracellular Cl−."

AP-1 activation is thought to be regulated by changes in intracellular oxidation/reduction reactions involving the redox factor-1 (Ref-1) protein. In this study, NIH 3T3 and HeLa cells were used to determine whether heat shock induces the AP-1 transcription factor via signaling pathways involving Ref-1. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction analysis and immunoblotting demonstrated that c-Fos and c-Jun were induced 2–10 h following heat shock, and this induction was accompanied by an increase in AP-1 DNA binding. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay extracts immunodepleted of Ref-1 protein demonstrated that the increase in AP-1 DNA-binding activity following heating was dependent upon the presence of Ref-1 and that Ref-1 regulates inducible, but not basal, AP-1 DNA-binding activity. This was confirmed by the restoration of heat-inducible DNA binding upon addition of Ref-1 to immunodepleted extracts. The ability of Ref-1 from heated cells to stimulate AP-1 DNA binding was abolished by chemical oxidation and restored by chemical reduction. These results indicate that heat shock activates c-Fos/c-Jun gene expression and AP-1 DNA binding and suggests that redox-sensitive signal transduction pathways involving Ref-1 may mediate heat-induced alterations in AP-1 activation.

These results indicate that heat shock activates c-Fos/c-Jun gene expression and AP-1 DNA binding and suggests that redox-sensitive signal transduction pathways involving Ref-1 may mediate heat-induced alterations in AP-1 activation. Most living cells are sensitive to sudden elevations in temperature and respond to this environmental insult by activating the heat shock response (1Lindquist S. Annu. Rev . Biochem. 1986; 55: 1151-1191Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Jurivich D.A. Chung J. Blenis J. J. Cell. Physiol. 1991; 148: 252-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The heat shock response has been intensively investigated and is primarily mediated at the transcriptional level by pre-existing transcriptional activators, termed heat shock factors (HSFs) 1The abbreviations used are: HSF, heat shock factor; RT-PCR, reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction; NEM, N-ethylmaleimide; DTT, dithiothreitol; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay (3Morimoto R.I. Kline M.P. Bimston D.N. Cotto J.J. Essays Biochem. 1998; 32: 17-29Google Scholar). Once activated, HSFs bind to regulatory heat shock elements present in the promoter region of genes coding for heat shock proteins (HSPs) (1Lindquist S. Annu. Rev . Biochem. 1986; 55: 1151-1191Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Morimoto R.I. Kline M.P. Bimston D.N. Cotto J.J. Essays Biochem. 1998; 32: 17-29Google Scholar). In addition to HSFs, it appears that several additional signal transduction cascades are also activated in response to heat including p38/HOG1 kinase (4Rouse J. Cohen P. Trigon S. Morange M.

Cell Res. 1991; 193: 274-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). These signaling pathways are also activated by a wide variety of additional environmental insults including oxidative stress. Studies of cross-resistance induced in response to oxidative stress and heat shock (10Spitz D.R. Dewey W.C. Li G.C. J. Cell. Physiol. 1987; 131: 364-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 11Spitz D.R. Li G.C. J. Cell. Physiol. 1990; 142: 255-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) suggest that one aspect of the cellular response to heat may be similar to cellular responses to oxidative stress. The mechanism responsible for causing cell death after thermal injury remains unclear. It has been suggested that one aspect of heat-induced cellular injury results from mitochondrial damage that disrupts intracellular oxidation/reduction reactions (10Spitz D.R. Dewey W.C. Li G.C. J.

Hence, heat shock may result in altered generation of reactive oxygen species as well as alterations in intracellular antioxidant capacity (13Mitchell J.B. Russo A. Radiat.

Mammalian cells and tissues exposed to heat shock have been shown: 1) increased conversion of xanthine dehydrogenase to the superoxide-generating enzyme xanthine oxidase, 2) alterations in thiol metabolism leading to the increased synthesis of glutathione (GSH) and increase in formation of oxidized glutathione (GSSG), 3) increased sensitivity to heat-induced cell killing when GSH is depleted, and 4) increased resistance to heat-induced cell killing in stable H2O2-resistant cell types which overexpress cellular antioxidants (glutathione, catalase, superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase, and glutathione transferase) (13Mitchell J.B.

In addition, in Saccharomyces cerevisiae prooxidant production, as measured by the oxidation-sensitive fluorescent probe, 2′,7′-dichlorofluoroscin diacetate, increased following heat shock (17Davidson J.F. Whyte B. Bissinger P.H. Schiestl R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5116-5121Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). Manipulations designed to reduce the production of reactive oxygen species (over expression of catalase, superoxide dismutase, cytochrome c peroxidase, and anaerobic conditions) protected cells from the lethal effects of heat (17Davidson J.F. Whyte B. Bissinger P.H. Schiestl R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5116-5121Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). These studies support the hypothesis that heat shock induces an imbalance in intracellular oxidation/reduction (redox) reactions resulting in increased steady-state prooxidant production and oxidative stress that contributes to the biological effects of heat shock. Alterations in intracellular oxidation/reduction reactions have been shown to activate signal transduction cascades that regulate as early response genes. These genes are believed to function in a protective or reparative capacity (23Karin M. Smeal T. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 418-422Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar, 24Kerppola T.K. Curran T. Nature. 1995; 373: 199-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 25Guyton K.Z. Spitz D.R. Holbrook N.J. Free Radical Biol. Med. 1996; 20: 735-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The early response genes c-Fos and c-Jun are members of a multigene family implicated in a number of stress-induced signal transduction cascades and thus provide useful models for investigating stress-invoked alterations in gene expression (26Kerr L.D. Inoue J. Verma I.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1992; 123: 496-501Crossref Scopus (71) Google Scholar). c-Fos and c-Jun proteins associate in homo- and/or heterodimers to form the mammalian transcription factor AP-1. It has been suggested that AP-1 may regulate expression of downstream target genes that are known to be involved with cellular antioxidant defense mechanisms (27Abate C. Patel L. Rauscher F.J. Curran T. Science. 1990; 249: 1157-1161Crossref PubMed Scopus (1377) Google Scholar, 28Franza B.R. Rauscher F.J. Josephs S.F. Curran T.

Stress-induced activation of these early response genes appears to rely, at least in part, on changes in intracellular oxidation/reduction (redox) (33Halliwell B. Gutteridge J.M. Cross C.E. J. Lab. Clin. Med. 1992; 119: 598-620PubMed Google Scholar, 34Maity A. Kao G.D. Muschel R.J. McKenna W.G Int. J. Radiat. Oncol. Biol. Phys. 1997; 37: 639-653Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 35Xanthoudakis S. Curran T. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 653-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar). Hence, mammalian cells appear to capitalize on inherent redox-sensitive signaling circuitry to respond to certain forms of environmental stresses that perturb oxidative metabolism (27Abate C. Patel L. Rauscher F.J. Curran T. Science. 1990; 249: 1157-1161Crossref PubMed Scopus (1377) Google Scholar, 36Xanthoudakis S. Miao G.G. Wang F. Pan Y.-C.E. Curran T. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3323-3335Crossref PubMed Scopus (826) Google Scholar). At least one mechanism regulating c-Fos/c-Jun DNA binding is mediated by a conserved cysteine (Cys) located in the basic DNA-binding domain of both proteins (27Abate C. Patel L. Rauscher F.J. Curran T. Science. 1990; 249: 1157-1161Crossref PubMed Scopus (1377) Google Scholar). In vitro these regulatory cysteines are not permissive for DNA binding under oxidized conditions, whereas reduction to a sulfhydryl state promotes DNA binding (27Abate C. Patel L. Rauscher F.J. Curran T. Science. 1990; 249: 1157-1161Crossref PubMed Scopus (1377) Google Scholar, 35Xanthoudakis S. Curran T. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 653-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar). As such, these critical cysteines act as a redox-sensitive “sulfhydryl switch” that reversibly modulates DNA binding (36Xanthoudakis S. Miao G.G. Wang F. Pan Y.-C.E. Curran T. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3323-3335Crossref PubMed Scopus (826) Google Scholar). In the absence of reducing agents, the redox factor-1 (Ref-1) protein regulates c-Fos/c-Jun DNA binding via the same conserved cysteine. Ref-1 (also designated APE, and HAP-1) is a DNA repair enzyme that also acts as a signaling factor regulating the DNA binding of several redox-sensitive transcription factors including NF-κB, Egr-1, and p53 (35Xanthoudakis S. Curran T. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 653-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar, 36Xanthoudakis S. Miao G.G. Wang F. Pan Y.-C.E. Curran T. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3323-3335Crossref PubMed Scopus (826) Google Scholar). Interestingly, a wide range of cellular stress agents also induce these transcription factors (23Karin M. Smeal T. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 418-422Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar, 24Kerppola T.K. Curran T. Nature. 1995; 373: 199-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Thus, Ref-1 may act as a pivotal signaling factor involved in the induction of early response genes, such as c-Fos and c-Jun. It has been suggested heat shock causes perturbations in cellular redox status. In addition, several early response genes as well as signaling cascades are activated by changes in cellular redox conditions. Hence, it is reasonable to hypothesize that heat-induced increases in early response gene expression (c-Fos and c-Jun) leading to increased AP-1-DNA binding may encompass a mechanism involving Ref-1. To address this hypothesis, the expression of c-Fos and c-Jun as well as the activation of the AP-1 transcription factor was determined following heat shock in human and rodent cell lines. When c-Fos and c-Jun expression as well as AP-1 activation were found to increase following heat shock, the role of Ref-1 in the activation of AP-1 binding was determined. These results indicate the induction of the early response genes c-Fos and c-Jun in response to heat shock is similar to that observed for other types of environmental stress. Furthermore, the redox-sensitive signal transduction protein, Ref-1, via heat-induced alternations in the oxidation/reduction state of the protein appears to regulate heat-inducible, but not basal, AP-1 DNA-binding activity. These results suggest that early response genes may play a role in the cellular responses to heat shock and that redox-sensitive signal transduction pathways involving Ref-1 may represent a common mechanism for the induction of AP-1 binding activity in response to environmental stress. HeLa (human cervical carcinoma) and NIH 3T3 (rodent fibroblasts) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated calf serum with penicillin (50 units/ml) and streptomycin (50 units/ml) in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37 °C. For heat shock experiments, cells were seeded at 2.5 × 106cells/10-cm diameter plate the night before exposure. Cells were heated at various time points by submerging parafilm sealed 10-cm plates in a pre-warmed circulating water bath at 45 °C for 15 min. Cells were immediately placed at 37 °C after heating and harvested at various time points. Total cellular RNA was isolated by using TRI reagent (Molecular Research, Cincinnati, OH) following the protocol of the manufacturer. The RNA was checked for purity and used in a quantitative RT-PCR analysis method that has been previously described (37Goswami P.C. Albee L.D. Spitz D.R. Ridnour L.A. Cell Prolif. 1997; 30: 271-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Primer sequences for c-Fos, c-Jun, and glyceraldehyde-3′-phosphate dehydrogenase were selected on separate exons to distinguish amplified products of mRNA from possible contaminating DNA or precursor RNA. The primer sequences and PCR product sizes have been previously described (37Goswami P.C. Albee L.D. Spitz D.R. Ridnour L.A. Cell Prolif. 1997; 30: 271-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Five microliters of the PCR amplified products were analyzed by electrophoresis on a 1.5% agarose gel. Gels were stained with ethidium bromide, photographed, dried and exposed to phosphoimager screen for quantitation of incorporated radioactivity in each individual band. Quantitation of results was obtained using a STORM 840 Phosphoimager. All results are presented as -fold increase above base-line control, unheated cells. Whole cell extracts were prepared at 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 24 h after heating as described (38Gius D. Cao X. Rauscher F.J. Cohen D.R. Curran T. Sukhatme V.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 10: 4243-4251Crossref Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Protein samples were separated on SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to a nitrocellulose filter using a semi-dry transfer apparatus (Owl, Inc). Western blotting analysis was done with polyclonal antibodies to c-Fos (Oncogene Science, AP1), c-Jun (Oncogene Science, AP2), and Ref-1 (Santa Cruz Biotech, Inc). Antibodies were diluted 1:1000 in a 2.5% milk, phosphate-buffered saline, 0.01% Tween 20 solution as described previously and hybridized overnight (39Stevenson M.A. Pollock S.S. Coleman N. Calderwood S.K. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 12-15PubMed Google Scholar). The blots were developed with an enhanced chemiluminescence method (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). EMSAs were performed as described previously utilizing a 32P-radiolabeled oligonucleotide corresponding to the consensus AP-1 DNA-binding site (38Gius D. Cao X. Rauscher F.J. Cohen D.R. Curran T. Sukhatme V.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 10: 4243-4251Crossref Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Briefly, whole cell extracts (10 μg) were incubated with poly(dI-dC) for 10 min on ice, followed by addition of radiolabeled oligonucleotide (200,000 cpm of radiolabeled probe per reaction) and incubated at 25 °C for 20 min. Supershift experiments were performed by the addition of either anti-Fos or anti-Jun antibody to the whole cell protein extract-poly(dI-dC), radiolabeled oligonucleotide followed by incubation for 20 min at 25 °C. For the cold AP-1 oligomer competition experiment, 1 μg of unlabeled AP-1 oligomer was added to the whole cell protein extract-poly(dI-dC) complex, kept on ice for 10 min followed by addition of radiolabeled oligonucleotide and incubation for 20 min at 25 °C. Samples were run on a 4.5% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, dried, and exposed to the phosphoimager screen for quantitation using a STORM 840 PhosphorImager from Molecular Dynamics. Immunodepletion EMSAs for Ref-1 were performed immediately after the extracts were prepared by adding 5 μl of anti-Ref-1 and 25 μl of protein A to 20 μl of EMSA control and heated extracts as described (40Yao K.-S. Xanthoudakis S. Curran T. O'Dwyer P.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5997-6003Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). After 2 h of gentle shaking at 4 °C, the tubes were spun at 12,000 rpm for 1 min and washed. The protein levels in the remaining extracts were determined and EMSAs were performed. Chemical modification of immunoprecipitated Ref-1 was performed by adding either diamide (80 μm), N-ethylmaleimide (NEM) (50 μm), or dithiothreitol (DTT) (8 mm) to immunoprecipitation/protein A pellet for 30 min. To remove the free residual chemicals from the immunoprecipitation reaction, the pellets were washed eight times before EMSA using non-heated Ref-1 immunodepleted extracts. Previous investigations have shown that HeLa cell c-Jun mRNA levels increase in response to heat (41Andrews G.K. Harding M.A. Calvet J.P. Adamson E.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 10: 3452-3460Google Scholar). As a first step, therefore, we sought to confirm and expand upon this finding by examining c-Jun and c-Fos mRNA levels following heating. Experiments were performed with NIH 3T3 and HeLa cells, representing immortalized and fully transformed cell lines, respectively. Asynchronous cycling NIH 3T3 and HeLa cells were heated (45 °C for 15 min) and then incubated at 37 °C until RNA isolation at 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 24 h. c-Fos and c-Jun mRNA levels were determined using quantitative RT-PCR (37Goswami P.C. Albee L.D. Spitz D.R. Ridnour L.A. Cell Prolif. 1997; 30: 271-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). In NIH 3T3 cells (Fig. 1 A), c-Fos and c-Jun expression increased 6- and 3-fold, respectively, when compared with control, unheated cells. The induction was initially apparent 2 h following heating and returned to basal levels by 10 h. Similarly, in HeLa cells (Fig. 1 B), c-Fos and c-Jun expression was induced 5- and 3-fold, respectively, following heating. Thus, in NIH 3T3 and HeLa cells the relative abundance of c-Fos and c-Jun mRNA is increased in response to heat shock. Furthermore, the accumulation of c-Fos and c-Jun mRNA following heat shock is similar in both magnitude and temporal expression. To determine whether the increased abundance of c-Fos and c-Jun mRNA in response to heating is accompanied by increased accumulation of immunoreactive protein, total cellular protein was isolated from both cell lines at 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 24 h following heat shock. Following heat shock in NIH 3T3 cells, an increase in c-Fos and c-Jun immunoreactive protein was apparent at 4–6 h (Fig. 2 A), reached a peak at 8 h (5- and 6-fold, respectively, as compared with control unheated cells), and returned to base line by 24 h. Similarly, in HeLa cells an increase in c-Fos and c-Jun immunoreactive protein was demonstrated 4–6 h following heat shock and returned to base line by 24 h (Fig. 2 B). Thus, increased accumulation of c-Jun and c-Fos mRNA following heat shock correlated with an increase in protein levels of similar magnitude and temporal expression. Furthermore, these experiments demonstrate that heat, like other types of environmental stress, increases early response gene expression. The Fos and Jun protein families form an array of heterodimeric protein complexes that bind to specific cis-acting DNA regulatory elements, referred to as AP-1 sites, to activate the expression of downstream target genes (24Kerppola T.K. Curran T. Nature. 1995; 373: 199-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 42Angel P. Imagawa M. Chiu R. Stein B. Rahmdorf H.J. Jonat C. Herrlich P. Karin M. Cell. 1987; 49: 729-739Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2156) Google Scholar). AP-1 sites are present in the promoter region of many genes, including c-Fos and c-Jun, as well as in other genes involved in the cellular response to environmental stress (34Maity A. Kao G.D. Muschel R.J. McKenna W.G Int. J. Radiat. Oncol. Biol. Phys. 1997; 37: 639-653Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Since c-Fos and c-Jun comprise the AP-1 DNA-binding complex and both c-Fos and c-Jun expression increase in response to heat, we sought to determine whether AP-1 DNA-binding activity increased following heat exposure. AP-1 DNA binding was measured by performing EMSA with extracts from NIH 3T3 and HeLa cells. Cells were heated to 45 °C for 15 min and then incubated for 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 24 h at 37 °C until harvested. NIH 3T3 cells demonstrated no difference in AP-1 DNA-binding activity between unheated controls and cells harvested at 2 and 4 h after heating (Fig. 3 A,lanes 1–4). In contrast, a 2-fold increase in DNA-binding activity was noted at 6 h (lane 5), reached a peak induction of 3-fold at 8 and 10 h (lanes 6 and 7), and returned to base line at 24 h (lane 8). These experiments were repeated in HeLa cells (Fig. 3 B) with a similar induction of AP-1 binding at 8–10 h (2.5-fold) after heat shock. Thus, the increased accumulation of c-Fos and c-Jun RNA and immunoreactive protein following heat shock temporally parallels an increase in AP-1 DNA-binding activity. To determine whether heat-induced activation of AP-1 DNA binding results from an increase in the DNA binding of complexes, which contain c-Fos and/or c-Jun, supershift experiments were performed using cell extracts from HeLa cells 8 h following heat shock (Fig. 4, lane 1). Anti-Fos (Fig. 4, lane 2), anti-Jun antibody (Fig.4, lane 3), or cold competitor DNA containing the AP-1 consensus motif (Fig. 4, lane 4) were added to cell extracts 10 min prior to addition of radiolabeled AP-1 oligomer. Fig. 4,lanes 2 and 3 demonstrate that the activated AP-1 complexes from heated cells contain immunoreactive c-Fos and c-Jun proteins. These results indicate that c-Fos and c-Jun proteins are present in the supershifted AP-1 complexes and suggest that the accumulation of c-Fos and c-Jun proteins (seen in Fig. 2) in response to heat contributes to the formation of heat-induced activated AP-1 complexes. Because AP-1 DNA-binding activity is increased by heat and Ref-1 is known to regulate AP-1 activity through a redox-sensitive mechanism (35Xanthoudakis S. Curran T. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 653-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar, 36Xanthoudakis S. Miao G.G. Wang F. Pan Y.-C.E. Curran T. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3323-3335Crossref PubMed Scopus (826) Google Scholar, 38Gius D. Cao X. Rauscher F.J. Cohen D.R. Curran T. Sukhatme V.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 10: 4243-4251Crossref Scopus (170) Google Scholar), we next sought to assess whether Ref-1 is involved with the regulation of heat-induced increases in AP-1 DNA binding. These experiments were accomplished using a Ref-1 antibody to remove Ref-1 protein from the extracts that were used to determine the increase in AP-1 DNA-binding activity in response to heat. Briefly, NIH 3T3 and HeLa cells extracts from the experiments shown in Fig. 3 were treated with the addition of protein A and anti-Ref-1 antibody, followed by gentle shaking at 4 °C for 2 h and spinning at 12,000 rpm for 1 min to pellet out the Ref-1 antibody complex. Western blot analysis confirmed the removal of Ref-1 protein from the gel-shift extracts as well as the presence of Ref-1 in the immunoprecipitated complex (data not shown). Western blotting was also performed to confirm the continued presence of c-Fos and c-Jun proteins in the Ref-1-depleted extracts as well as the lack of c-Fos and c-Jun protein in the immunoprecipitated complex (data not shown). Protein concentrations were determined and EMSA was performed using the Ref-1-depleted extracts. AP-1 DNA binding in unheated NIH 3T3 (Fig.5 A, lane 1) and HeLa cells (Fig. 5 B, lane 1) with Ref-1 present (immunoprecipitation was performed with protein A only) are shown as controls. The same extracts were immunodepleted of Ref-1 (Fig. 5,A and B, lanes 3), and when compared with the DNA binding in lane 1, no difference is observed. These results suggest that the presence of Ref-1 in the extracts was not required for AP-1 DNA-binding activity in the unstressed condition. As a positive control, the extracts from heated cells harvested at 8 h were immunoprecipitated with protein A only (Fig. 5,A and B, lanes 2). Similar to the results in Fig. 3, lanes 5 and 6, these positive controls demonstrated a 2.5-fold increase in DNA-binding activity (Fig.5, A and B, lanes 2). In the Ref-1 depleted extracts from heated cells isolated at 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 24 h, there was no increase in AP-1 DNA-binding activity, relative to the unheated extracts (Fig. 5, A and B,lanes 4–9). These results indicate that the presence of Ref-1 in the extracts from heated cells was required for the heat-inducible increase in AP-1 DNA-binding activity. To confirm that Ref-1 from heated cells must be present in the NIH 3T3 cell extracts to observe heat-induced increases in AP-1 DNA binding, Ref-1-containing immunoprecipitates from heated and unheated cells were added back to the Ref-1-immunodepleted extracts from heated cells harvested 8 h following heat shock (Fig.6 A). When Ref-1 immunoprecipitate from heated cells was added back to Ref-1 minus extracts from heated cells (Fig. 6, lane 3), the heat-induced increase in AP-1 DNA binding was restored (comparelane 3 to lane 2). When Ref-1 immunoprecipitate from unheated cells was added to Ref-1 minus heated cell extracts (lane 4), no increase in AP-1 DNA binding was observed (compare lane 4 to lane 2). Interestingly, when Ref-1 immunoprecipitate from heated cells (8 h) was added to Ref-1 minus extracts from non-heated cells (lane 5), AP-1 DNA binding also increased (compare lane 5 to lane 1). Equal amounts of immunoprecipitated Ref-1 from control and heated cells were confirmed by Western analysis to rule out the possibility that the induction of AP-1 DNA binding was because of increased Ref-1 immunoprecipitated protein (data not shown). These results confirm that the presence of Ref-1 from heated cells is required to activate AP-1 DNA binding It has been shown that the ability of Ref-1 protein to regulate AP-1 DNA binding in vitro is abolished by chemical oxidants and induced by chemical reductants (27Abate C. Patel L. Rauscher F.J. Curran T. Science. 1990; 249: 1157-1161Crossref PubMed Scopus (1377) Google Scholar,36Xanthoudakis S. Miao G.G. Wang F. Pan Y.-C.E. Curran T. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3323-3335Crossref PubMed Scopus (826) Google Scholar). To determine whether the redox status of Ref-1 protein from heated cells regulates AP-1 DNA-binding activity, Ref-1 from heated cells was immunoprecipitated and treated with chemicals that alter oxidation/reduction status. Following a vigorous washing step, the immunoprecipitated Ref-1 was then added to non-heated Ref-1-immunodepleted cell extracts, and AP-1 DNA-binding activity was elevated. Ref-1 from heated cells was immunoprecipitated and treated in the presence of either diamide (a sulfhydryl oxidizing agent), NEM (a sulfhydryl-specific alkylating agent), or DTT (a sulfhydryl-reducing agent), and washed eight times to remove any free chemical. Ref-1 immunoprecipitated from heated NIH 3T3 cells without chemicals is shown as a control (Fig. 6 B, lane 1). The addition of diamide or NEM to immunoprecipitated Ref-1 from heated cells (lanes 2 and 3) decreased AP-1 DNA binding. Ref-1 immunoprecipitated from heated cells and treated with DTT increased AP-1 DNA binding 2-fold as compared with Ref-1 immunoprecipitated from heated cells and not treated with chemicals (lane 1 versus 4). Finally, immunoprecipitated Ref-1 from heated cells treated with diamide were washed eight times to remove any free chemical from the reaction and subsequently treated with DTT. Treatment with DTT after exposure to diamide completely restored the ability of Ref-1 from heated cells to induce AP-1 DNA binding (lanes 1 versus 5). These results suggest that alterations in the oxidation/reduction (redox) status of the Ref-1 protein from heated cells play a central role in the enhancement of AP-1 DNA-binding activity following heat shock. The heat shock response is a rapid, complex, highly regulated process that involves coordinate control of multiple signal transduction pathways. The specific signaling pathways activated by elevated temperature, which result in the development of the heat shock response, are not completely understood. Interestingly, several components of the signaling pathways leading to the heat shock response are also stimulated by environmental stresses other than elevated temperature. These include exposure to hypoxia, heavy metals, amino acid analogues, and viral infections (3Morimoto R.I. Kline M.P. Bimston D.N. Cotto J.J. Essays Biochem. 1998; 32: 17-29Google Scholar, 5Adler V.

These results have been interpreted to suggest that heat, perhaps via alterations in cellular metabolism, produces a condition of oxidative stress similar to that seen with other forms of cellular stress (10Spitz D.R.

If this were true, it might be expected that cellular pathways that sense changes in intracellular redox might also respond to heat shock. Therefore, given that several early response genes appear to play a role in the cellular response to oxidative stress, we questioned whether these same signal transduction pathways could be activated in the cellular response to heat. The central findings of our work show that heat shock leads to the induction of the early response genes, c-Fos and c-Jun, as well as increasing AP-1 DNA-binding activity by a mechanism that appears to involve the redox-sensitive signaling protein, Ref-1. To investigate the role of early response genes in cellular responses to heat shock, NIH 3T3 and HeLa cells, representing immortalized and malignant cell lines, respectively, were utilized. These experiments demonstrate: 1) increased accumulation of c-Fos and c-Jun mRNA, protein, and AP-1 DNA-binding activity in response to heating in a temporally consistent manner; 2) that the induction of AP-1 DNA-binding activity is dependent upon Ref-1; 3) that Ref-1 appears to regulate heat-inducible, but not basal, AP-1 DNA-binding activity; and 4) that Ref-1 signaling in response to heat is redox-regulated. Interestingly, the kinetics of induction of these changes in early response genes were somewhat delayed following heat shock (2–10 h) as compared with other forms of environmental stress that perturb cellular redox more immediately, such as phorbol esters and ionizing radiation. This may reflect an inherent difference in the mechanism by which heat perturbs intracellular oxidation/reduction reactions as compared with other agents. Immunodepletion experiments and re-addition of immunoprecipitated Ref-1 to immunodepleted EMSA cell extracts demonstrated that Ref-1 from heated cells must be physically present in the binding reaction for the heat-induced induction of AP-1 DNA binding to be observed. Interestingly, when immunoprecipitated Ref-1 from heated cells harvested at 8 h was added to Ref-1-immunodepleted EMSA cell extracts from non-heated cells, an increase in AP-1 DNA binding was observed. These results suggest that Ref-1 is altered in a specific way following heating such that it participates in the activation of AP-1 DNA binding even in extracts from non-heated cells. Furthermore, these results support the conclusion that Ref-1 from heated cells must be physically present in the EMSA reactions to pass a “signal” to the AP-1 transcription factor complexes, resulting in an increase in DNA binding. This observation is in agreement with the results published by Yao et al. (40Yao K.-S. Xanthoudakis S. Curran T. O'Dwyer P.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5997-6003Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar) where increased AP-1 DNA-binding activity in response to hypoxia/reoxygenation were abolished by immunodepletion of Ref-1 protein. Overall, our results using heat shock as well as the work of others using hypoxia/reoxygenation (40Yao K.-S. Xanthoudakis S. Curran T. O'Dwyer P.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5997-6003Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar) suggest that environmental stress generates a signal that is passed through the Ref-1 protein to activate the DNA binding capability of the AP-1 complex Ref-1 is a bifunctional protein that acts as a DNA repair enzyme as well as a stimulator of DNA binding of transcriptional factors by a redox-dependent mechanism (35Xanthoudakis S. Curran T. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 653-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar, 36Xanthoudakis S. Miao G.G. Wang F. Pan Y.-C.E. Curran T.

Biol. 1994; 14: 5997-6003Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Ref-1 protein purified from HeLa cells increases the DNA-binding activity of c-Fos and c-Jun through critical cysteine residues (Fos Cys-154 and Jun Cys-272) shown to be sensitive to chemical oxidation-reduction experiments done in vitro (27Abate C. Patel L. Rauscher F.J. Curran T. Science. 1990; 249: 1157-1161Crossref PubMed Scopus (1377) Google Scholar). These critical cysteine residues are flanked by the basic amino acids lysine and arginine (KCR), creating a motif that is sensitive to changes in cellular oxidation/reduction status that appear to alter DNA-binding activity (35Xanthoudakis S. Curran T. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 653-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar). The oxidation/reduction status of this motif appears to be biologically significant (44Okuno H. Akahori A. Sato H. Xanthoudakis S. Curran T. Iba H. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 695-701PubMed Google Scholar) and is conserved in all of the c-Fos- and c-Jun-related proteins (24Kerppola T.K. Curran T. Nature. 1995; 373: 199-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Genetic analysis of Ref-1 has identified a cysteine at position 65 in the redox domain that is critical for the redox-sensitive activation of c-Fos/c-Jun DNA binding. This critical cysteine residue (reduced) is required for a direct interaction between Ref-1 and c-Jun in vitro, suggesting that Ref-1 may act as a redox-sensitive sulfhydryl switch that activates AP-1 DNA binding (36Xanthoudakis S. Miao G.G. Wang F. Pan Y.-C.E. Curran T. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3323-3335Crossref PubMed Scopus (826) Google Scholar,45Walker L.J. Craig R.B. Harris A.L. Hickson I.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4884-4889Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). The results from Fig. 6 B suggest that heat shock perturbs intracellular oxidation/reduction reactions such that a change in Ref-1 protein redox state enables Ref-1 to alter AP-1 DNA binding. It has been suggested that heat, perhaps via alterations in mitochondrial function, thiol metabolism, and lipid peroxidation, can cause oxidative stress (13Mitchell J.B. Russo A. Radiat. Res. 1983; 95: 471-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 22Skibba J.L. Quebbeman E.J. Kalbfleisch J.H. Cancer Res. 1986; 46: 6000-6003PubMed Google Scholar). If this were true, it might be expected that previously identified biochemical pathways that respond to protect cells against the detrimental effects of oxidative stress would also respond to heat shock. c-Fos, c-Jun, and AP-1 complexes are thought to regulate genes that control pathways responsible for the detoxification of reactive oxygen species and resistance to oxidative stress (i.e. heme oxygenase, γ-glutamylcysteine synthase, glutathione S-transferase, and NAD(P)H:quinone reductase) (29Sekhar K.R.

Some of these proteins, most notably heme-oxygenase (HSP-32) are induced by heat shock. Therefore, our results support the speculation that accumulation of c-Fos and c-Jun and activation of AP-1 complexes may play a role in regulating cellular defense against oxidative stress following heat shock. In summary, the central findings of our work are that heat shock leads to the increased expression of early response genes, c-Fos and c-Jun, as well as the activation of AP-1 DNA-binding activity by a mechanism that appears to involve the redox factor-1 (Ref-1) protein. Taken together with previous investigations (40Yao K.-S. Xanthoudakis S. Curran T. O'Dwyer P.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5997-6003Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar), these results support the concept that a common central pathway mediating cellular responses to heat shock or other types of environmental or metabolic oxidative stress may involve redox-sensitive signaling pathways leading to AP-1 activation via the Ref-1 protein.

It has been shown that the amount of poly-N-acetyllactosamine is increased inN-glycans, when they contain Galβ1→4GlcNAcβ1→6(Galβ1→4GlcNAcβ1→2)Manα1→6 branched structure. To determine how this increased synthesis of poly-N-acetyllactosamines takes place, the branched acceptor was incubated with a mixture of i-extension enzyme (iGnT) and β1,4galactosyltransferase I (β4Gal-TI). First,N-acetyllactosamine repeats were more readily added to the branched acceptor than the summation of poly-N-acetyllactosamines formed individually on each unbranched acceptor. Surprisingly, poly-N-acetyllactosamine was more efficiently formed on Galβ1→4GlcNAcβ1→2Manα→R side chain than in Galβ1→4GlcNAcβ1→6Manα→R, due to preferential action of iGnT on Galβ1→4GlcNAcβ1→2Manα→R side chain.

Significantly, the amount of GnTV is increased in various tumors including colonic carcinoma cells and those transformed with oncogenes (23Yamashita K. Ohkura T. Tachibana Y. Takasaki S. Kobata A. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 10834-10840Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Dennis J.W. Laferte S. Waghorne C. Breitman M.L. Kerbel R.S.

Chem. 1992; 267: 5700-5711Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Overexpression of GnTV in cultured cells was reported to result in acquiring the capability of growth in soft agar and tumor formation after subcutaneous injection of the transfected cells (28Demetriou M. Nabi I.R. Coppolino M. Dedhar S. Dennis J.W. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 383-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). The increased expression of sialyl Lex apparently takes place in those tumor cells when α1,3-fucosyltransferase is also present. In fact, highly metastatic colonic carcinoma cells express more sialyl Lex in poly-N-acetyllactosamines than poorly metastatic counterparts (27Saitoh O. Wang W.-C. Lotan R. Fukuda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5700-5711Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, our recent studies demonstrated that B16 mouse melanoma cells produced many more lung tumor foci after the cells were transfected with α1,3-fucosyltransferase to form sialyl Lex in poly-N-acetyllactosamines (29Ohyama C. Tsuboi S. Fukuda M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1516-1525Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). These results, as a whole, indicate that the formation of poly-N-acetyllactosamine plays a critical role for carbohydrate recognition in cell-cell interaction. Previously, we have demonstrated that poly-N-acetyllactosamines in core 2 branchedO-glycans are synthesized through iGnT and a newly discovered member of β1,4-galactosyltransferase, β4Gal-TIV (30Ujita M. McAuliffe J. Schwientek T. Almeida R. Hindsgaul O. Clausen H. Fukuda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34843-34849Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). We have also found that β4Gal-TI, iGnT, and I-branching enzyme are involved in the synthesis of I-branched poly-N-acetyllactosamines (31Ujita M. McAuliffe J. Suzuki M. Hindsgaul O. Clausen H. Fukuda M.N. Fukuda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9296-9304Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In the same study, we found that the addition of N-acetyllactosamine repeats to linear poly-N-acetyllactosamines is preferred over the extension ofN-acetyllactosamine to I-branches, mainly because the first galactosylation of a GlcNAcβ1→6 branch is inefficient. These studies thus demonstrate intricate interaction between a specific glycosyltransferase and an acceptor molecule, which largely contributes to the control of poly-N-acetyllactosamine synthesis. In these studies, we utilized molecular tools that have recently become available, such as cDNAs encoding i-extension enzyme (32Sasaki K. Kurata-Miura K. Ujita M. Angata K. Nakagawa S. Sekine S. Nishi T. Fukuda M. Proc. Nati. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14294-14299Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), novel members of β4Gal-T (33Schwientek T. Almeida R. Levery S. Holmes E. Bennett E. Clausen H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29331-29340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), and I-branching enzyme (34Bierhuizen M.F.A. Mattei M.-G. Fukuda M. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 468-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). These results prompted us in the present study to determine how poly-N-acetyllactosamine is formed in branchedN-glycans. Our results demonstrated that the addition ofGlcNAcβ1→6Manα→R side chain renders the resultantGlcNAcβ1→6(GlcNAcβ1→2)Manα1→6Manβ→R an extremely efficient acceptor for β4Gal-TI and i-extension enzyme. Moreover, we found that the i-extension enzyme prefers Galβ1→4GlcNAcβ1→2Manα→R side chain over Galβ1→4GlcNAcβ1→6Manα→R side chain, whereas the opposite is true for β4Gal-TI. Such complementary effects apparently result in forming similar size and abundance of poly-N-acetyllactosamines in both chains ofGlcNAcβ1→6(GlcNAcβ1→2)Manα→R structures. cDNA encoding iGnT was cloned into pcDNA3.1, resulting in pcDNA3.1-iGnT as described previously (32Sasaki K. Kurata-Miura K. Ujita M. Angata K. Nakagawa S. Sekine S. Nishi T. Fukuda M. Proc. Nati. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14294-14299Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). pcDNAI-A, harboring cDNA encoding a signal sequence and an IgG binding domain ofStaphylococcus aureus protein A, was constructed as described before (35Angata K. Suzuki M. Fukuda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28524-28532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The catalytic domain of iGnT was cloned into this vector, resulting in pcDNAI-A·iGnT (32Sasaki K. Kurata-Miura K. Ujita M. Angata K. Nakagawa S. Sekine S. Nishi T. Fukuda M. Proc. Nati. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14294-14299Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). pcDNAI-A and pcDNAI-A·iGnT were separately transfected with LipofectAMINE Plus (Life Technologies, Inc.) into COS-1 cells as described previously (36Nakayama J. Fukuda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1829-1832Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The chimeric enzyme released into serum-free OPTI-MEM was used after adsorbing the protein A chimeric enzyme to IgG-Sepharose 6FF (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) as described previously (36Nakayama J. Fukuda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1829-1832Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Alternatively, the culture medium was concentrated 100-fold or 1000-fold by a Centricon 10 concentrator (Amicon) and directly used as an enzyme source. In most of the studies, the concentrated culture medium was used for iGnT because IgG-Sepharose bound enzymes had a low activity, as seen for other glycosyltransferases (37Bakker H. Van Tetering A.

Chem. 1997; 272: 13622-13628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Typically, the activities of iGnT in the incubation mixture was 38.0 nmol/h/ml (for addition of one GlcNAc) or 380 nmol/h/ml (for poly-N-acetyllactosamine synthesis), using 0.5 mm Galβ1→4Glcβ→p-nitrophenol (Toronto Research Chemicals) as an acceptor. The medium from mock-transfected COS-1 cells contained less than one-fifth of iGnT activity compared with that derived from pcDNAI-A·iGnT-transfected COS-1 cells, as described (32Sasaki K. Kurata-Miura K. Ujita M. Angata K. Nakagawa S. Sekine S. Nishi T. Fukuda M. Proc. Nati. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14294-14299Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). β4Gal-TII, -TIII, and -TIV were expressed in insect cells, and the supernatants from these transfected insect cells were used as an enzyme source as described previously (30Ujita M.

Human milk β4Gal-T preparation (Sigma) was directly used as β4Gal-TI (30Ujita M. McAuliffe J. Schwientek T. Almeida R. Hindsgaul O. Clausen H. Fukuda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34843-34849Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). β4Gal-TV (39Sato T. Furukawa K. Bakker H. Van den Eijnden D.H. Van Die I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Clausen H. Fukuda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34843-34849Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). For comparing the enzymatic activities of different β4Gal-T samples, the final concentration of β4Gal-TI, -TII, -TIII, -TIV, and -TV was adjusted to 38.0 nmol/h/ml as measured using 0.5 mmGlcNAcβ→p-nitrophenol (Sigma) as an acceptor. The branched pentasaccharidesGlcNAcβ1→6(Galβ1→4GlcNAcβ1→2)Manα1→6Manβ1→O(CH2)7CH3(octyl) (compound 1) and Galβ1→4GlcNAcβ1→6(GlcNAcβ1→2)Manα1→6Manβ1→octyl (compound 2) were synthesized from octyl 3, 4-di-O-benzyl-α-d-mannopyranosyl(1→6)-2,3,4-tri-O-benzyl-β-dmannopyranoside (compound 3) and the donors 3,4,6-tri-O-acetyl-2-deoxy-2-phthalimido-β-d-glucopyranosyl chloride (compound 4), the corresponding trichloroacetimidate (compound 5), or 2,3,4,6-tetra-Oacetyl-β-d-galactopyranosyl(1→4)-3,6-di-O-benzyl-2-deoxy-2-phthalimido-β-d-glucopyranosyl trichloroacetimidate (compound 6). All glycosylations were performed under nitrogen in the presence of 4 Å molecular sieves and monitored by TLC. Thus, the acceptor compound 3 was glycosylated with the donor 4 (1.5 eq) in dichloromethane at −20 °C with a mixture of silver trifluoromethanesulfonate and silver carbonate (1:3) to give a trisaccharide (compound 7). Compound 7 was then glycosylated with the donor compound 6 (1.2 eq) in dichloromethane at −40 °C with catalytic triethyl trifluoromethanesulfonate to give a pentasaccharide (compound 8). Conversely, the 2′-O-p-methoxybenzyl derivative of the acceptor compound 3 was glycosylated with the donor compound 6 (1.3 eq) in dichloromethane at −40 °C with catalytic triethyl trifluoromethanesulfonate to give a tetrasaccharide (compound 9). Compound 9 was then treated with 80% acetic acid at 50 °C to remove the 2′-O-p-methoxybenzyl group and subsequently glycosylated with the donor compound 5 (2 eq) in dichloromethane at −10 °C with catalytic triethyl trifluoromethanesulfonate to give a pentasaccharide (compound 10). Deprotection of compounds 8 and 10 was performed using published conditions as detailed previously (40Srivastava G. Hindsgaul O. Carbohydr Res. 1992; 224: 83-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). The crude products, compounds 1 and 2 respectively, were isolated on C18 reverse-phase Sep-Pak cartridges as described previously (30Ujita M. McAuliffe J. Schwientek T. Almeida R. Hindsgaul O. Clausen H. Fukuda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34843-34849Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) (Waters Associates) and purified on LH-20 Sephadex eluted with water. The products were characterized by 1H NMR spectroscopy and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry. The labeled hexasaccharides [3H]Galβ1→4GlcNAcβ1→6(Galβ1 →4GlcNAcβ1→2)Manα1→6Manβ1→octyl (compound 11) and Galβ1→4GlcNAcβ1→6([3H]Galβ1→4GlcNAcβ1→2)Manα1→6Manβ1→octyl (compound 12) were synthesized from compounds 1 and 2, respectively, through treatment with 50 milliunits of bovine milk β4Gal -TI (Sigma) and UDP-[3H]Gal (10 μCi/μmol acceptor) in 50 mm HEPES buffer (pH 7.4) containing 10 mmMnCl2 at 37 °C. Thus, UDP-[3H]Gal (10 μCi/μmol acceptor) was added to the reaction medium containing either compound 1 or 2 (1 mm), along with UDP-galactose (0.5 mm). After 12 h, additional UDP-galactose (1.5 mm) was added, and incubation was continued for another 12 h. TLC of the products indicated absence of the starting material. Compounds 11 and 12 were isolated as described above and determined to have specific activities of ∼8.5 Ci/mol. Compound 1 (3 mm) was treated with jack bean β-N-acetylglucosaminidase (4 units) in 50 mmsodium acetate buffer, pH 5.5, at 37 °C for 3 days, resulting in the tetrasaccharide Galβ1→4GlcNAcβ1→ 2Manα1→6Manβ1→octyl (compound 13). Similarly, compound 1 (5 mm) was treated with Escherichia coli β-galactosidase (20 units) in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4, at 37 °C overnight, resulting in the tetrasaccharideGlcNAcβ1→6(GlcNAcβ1→2)Manα1→6Manβ1→octyl (compound 14). Isolation, purification, and characterization of these compounds was performed as described above. Detailed procedures of these syntheses will be published elsewhere. 2J. McAuliffe, M. Ujita, M. Fukuda, and O. Hindsgaul, manuscript in preparation. Partial 1H NMR results (300 MHz, D2O) (compounds 1, 2, 13, and 14) are as follows. Compound 1: δ4.90 (s, H-1′), 4.68 (s, H-1), 4.63 (d, J = 7.8 Hz, 1H), 4.56 (d, J = 7.7 Hz, 1H), 4.48 (d,J = 8.3 Hz, 1H), 2.09, 2.05 (2 s, 6H, NHAc). Compound 2: δ 4.88 (s, H-1′), 4.66 (s, H-1), 4.60–4.55 (m, 2H), 4.47 (d, J = 8.3 Hz, 1H), 2.06, 2.03 (2 s, 6H, NHAc). Compound 13: δ 4.94 (s, H-1′), 4.67 (s, H-1), 4.63–4.60 (m, 1H), 4.48 (d, J = 7.6 Hz, 1H), 2.06 (s, 3H, NHAc). Compound 14: δ 4.87 (s, H-1′), 4.66 (s, H-1), 4.58 (d,J = 8.1 Hz, 1H), 4.54 (d, J = 8.1 Hz, 1H) 2.05, 2.03 (2 s, 6H, NHAc). To assay the transfer of N-acetylglucosamine residues by the iGnT, the reaction mixture was exactly the same as described previously (30Ujita M. McAuliffe J. Schwientek T. Almeida R. Hindsgaul O.

The incubation mixture was applied to a C18-reverse phase Sep-Pak cartridge column (Waters), and the product was eluted as described previously (30Ujita M. McAuliffe J. Schwientek T. Almeida R. Hindsgaul O. Clausen H. Fukuda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34843-34849Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The product was then analyzed by HPLC using NH2-bonded silica column (Varian Micropak AX-5) as described previously (30Ujita M. McAuliffe J. Schwientek T. Almeida R. Hindsgaul O. Clausen H. Fukuda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34843-34849Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The radioactivity of aliquots in the effluent was determined. The iGnT was also incubated with [3H]Galβ1→4GlcNAcβ1→6(Galβ1→4GlcNAcβ1→2)Manα1→6Manβ1→octyl or Galβ1→4GlcNAcβ1→6([3H]Galβ1→4GlcNAcβ1→2)Manα1→6Manβ1→octyl. In these experiments, nonradioactive 5 mm UDP-GlcNAc was used. In all of the above reactions, the reaction mixture was incubated for 10 h to analyze the products or for 1 h to obtain kinetic parameters. To assay poly-N-acetyllactosamine formation, 0.5 mm acceptor was incubated with β4Gal-TI (760.0 nmol/h/ml) and iGnT (380.0 nmol/h/ml) under the conditions described previously (30Ujita M.

When [3H]Galβ1→4GlcNAcβ1→6(Galβ1→4GlcNAcβ1→2)Manα1 →6Manβ1→octyl (compound 11, see above) and Galβ1→4GlcNAcβ1→6([3H]Galβ1→4GlcNAcβ1→2)Manα1→6Manβ1→octyl (compound 12, see above) were used as acceptors, nonradioactive donor substrates were used. The products were purified by HPLC using the same NH2-bonded silica column as described above. A peak containing one N-acetyllactosamine repeat was digested with diplococcal β-galactosidase (41Glasgow L.R. Paulson J.C. Hill R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 8615-8623Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the digest was purified by a Sep-Pak column and then analyzed by HPLC as described above. A peak containing two N-acetyllactosamine repeats was sequentially digested with diplococcal β-galactosidase, jack bean β-N-acetylglucosaminidase, and diplococcal β-galactosidase. After each digestion, the digest was analyzed by HPLC using the same NH2-bonded column as described above. Aliquots were taken for determining radioactivity, obtaining the ratio of the radioactivity in the product and starting material. As a third experiment, 0.5 mmGalβ1→4GlcNAcβ1→6(GlcNAcβ1→2)Manα1→6Manβ1→octyl or 0.5 mm GlcNAcβ1→6(Galβ1→4GlcNAcβ1→2)Manα1→6Manβ1→octyl was incubated with β4Gal-TI (152.0 nmol/h/ml), iGnT (38.0 or 76.0 nmol/h/ml), 0.5 mm UDP-[3H]GlcNAc, and 0.5 mm UDP-[3H]Gal in 50 μl of 100 mm cacodylate buffer, pH 7.0, containing 20 mmMnCl2 and 10 mm each of GlcNAc-1,5-lactone and Gal-1,5-lactone. After incubation at 37 °C for 4 h, the reaction products were purified by a Sep-Pak column and subjected to HPLC as described above. In these experiments, the incubation conditions were first determined where only oneN-acetyllactosamine unit can be added to Galβ1→4GlcNAcβ1→3Galβ1→4Glc. In addition, β4Gal-TI was 4-fold in excess over iGnT, the same ratio as in HL-60 cells (42Lee N. Wang W.-C. Fukuda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 20476-20487Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In certain experiments, β4Gal-TI was 2-fold in excess over iGnT. Products were digested with Escherichia freundii endo-β-galactosidase for 18 h at 37 °C (43Fukuda M.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 3900-3905Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The digestion conditions used allowed the cleavage of galactose linkage, where no β1,6-linked N-acetylglucosamine is attached (2Fukuda M.N. Takahashi N. Muramatsu T. CRC Handbook of Endoglycosidases and Glycoamidases. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1992: 55-103Google Scholar, 43Fukuda M.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 3900-3905Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The digests were subjected to HPLC using AX-5 column. To determine whether iGnT has a preference for the addition of N-acetylglucosamine to one ofN-glycan acceptors, Galβ1→4GlcNAcβ1→6Manα→R, Galβ1 →4GlcNAcβ1→2Manα→R, and Galβ1→4GlcNAcβ1→6(Galβ1→4GlcNAcβ1→2)Manα→R were incubated with iGnT. First, iGnT acted in almost identical efficiency on Galβ1→ 4GlcNAcβ1→6Manα→R and Galβ1→4GlcNAcβ1→ 2Manα→R (Figs. 1 A and 2, Aand B), indicating that the enzyme does not prefer one acceptor over the other. Second, the branched acceptor has a better affinity and higher V max for addition of oneN-acetylglucosamine (Fig. 1 A and TableI). When the products from the 10-h incubation of the branched acceptor was analyzed, the majority of the products contained only one N-acetylglucosamine residue, and a mere 5.7% (in molar ratio) of the whole products contained twoN-acetylglucosamine residues (Fig.2 C).Figure 2Analysis of the products after 10 h-incubation of N-glycan acceptors with iGnT .

To further define the domains of interaction, we have introduced additional Cys into subunit ε and subunit c and tested for cross-link formation following sulfhydryl oxidation. The results show that Cys, in a continuous stretch of residues 26–33 in subunit ε, can be cross-linked to Cys at positions 40, 42, and 44 in the polar loop region of subunit c. The results are interpreted, and the subunit interaction is modeled using the NMR and x-ray diffraction structures of the monomeric subunits together with information on the packing arrangement of subunit c in a ring of 12 subunits.

The H+-transporting, F1F0-ATP synthase of Escherichia coli utilizes an H+electrochemical gradient to drive ATP synthesis during oxidative phosphorylation (1Senior A.E. Physiol. Rev. 1988; 68: 177-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar). Similar enzymes are found in mitochondria, chloroplasts, and other bacteria. The enzymes are composed of two sectors, termed F1 and F0. The F1sector contains the catalytic sites for ATP synthesis, and when released from membrane, it shows ATPase activity. The F0sector traverses the membrane and functions as the H+transporter. When F1 is bound to F0, the complex acts as a reversible, H+-transporting ATP synthase or ATPase. In E. coli, F1 is composed of five types of subunits in an α3β3γδε stoichiometry, and F0 is composed of three types of subunits in ana 1 b 2 c 12stoichiometry (2Fillingame R.H. Jones P.C. Jiang W.

Subunits γ and ε are thought to rotate as a unit because they can be cross-linked to each other with minimal inhibitory effects on ATPase activity (14Watts S.D. Teng C. Capaldi R.A. J. Biol.

Subunit b is anchored in the membrane via a single transmembrane helix that is connected to a polar, elongated cytoplasmic domain that is thought to play a key role in fixing F1 to F0 (21Wilkens S. Capaldi R.A. Nature. 1998; 393: 29Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Subunit c is a protein of 79-amino acid residues that folds in the membrane in a hairpin-like structure. The two hydrophobic transmembrane α-helices are joined by a more polar loop region that is exposed to the F1 binding side of the membrane. Aspartyl 61, lying at the center of transmembrane helix-2, is thought to be the site of H+ binding during transport (22Fillingame R.H. J. Exp. Biol. 1997; 200: 217-224Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The polar loop was proposed to play a key role in coupling H+ transport to ATP synthesis or hydrolysis based upon the uncoupled phenotypes of mutants with substitutions in the conserved Arg41-Gln42-Pro43 sequence of the polar loop (22Fillingame R.H.

The “uncoupled” phenotype of thecQ42E mutant proved to be suppressed by second site substitutions in Glu31 of F1 subunit ε (24Zhang Y. Oldenburg M. Fillingame R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10221-10224Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and this led to cross-linking studies demonstrating a physical proximity between the polar loop and subunits γ and ε of F1 (14Watts S.D.

A recently determined NMR structure of monomeric subunit c conforms well with folding predictions made from biochemical and genetic analysis (27Girvin M.E. Rastogi V.K. Abildgaard F. Markley J.L. Fillingame R.H. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 8817-8824Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Recent experiments now indicate that the c 12oligomer of F0 is organized in a ring with transmembrane helix-1 on the inside and transmembrane helix-2 on the outside (2Fillingame R.H. Jones P.C.

The structural data fit well with rotary models where H+ transport at the a-c interface is proposed to drive rotation of the oligomeric c ring as the Asp61 carboxylate is protonated and deprotonated from alternate access channels on each side of the membrane (10Duncan T.M.

The rotation of subunit c is proposed to drive the rotation of the γε unit in F1 via a fixed linkage between subunit c and the γ and ε subunits (14Watts S.D. Teng C. Capaldi R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28341-28347Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) although other explanations have been proposed (22Fillingame R.H. J. Exp.

The elongated cytoplasmic domain of subunit b is thought to extend from the membrane surface to the top of F1 as a “second stalk”, or stator, to hold F1 fixed as subunit γ rotates at the center of the molecule (21Wilkens S.

In this study, the interacting regions of the polar loop of subunitsc and subunit ε are more thoroughly defined by disulfide cross-linking of Cys introduced into the two subunits. The experimental design and interpretation was aided by a structural model for subunit ε derived by NMR (38Wilkens S. Dahlquist F.W. McIntosh L.P. Donaldson L.W. Capaldi R.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 961-967Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar) and x-ray crystallography (39Uhlin U. Cox G.B. Guss J.M. Structure (Lond.). 1997; 5: 1219-1230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). The Cys residues of subunit ε that form cross-links with subunit clocalize to a span of residues 26–33 which fold as two strands of antiparallel β-sheet connected by a loop. A structural model for the subunit-subunit interaction is developed from the structures of the monomeric subunits and information on the organization of thec-oligomer, using distance constraints from the cross-linking data reported here. The model indicates that the segment of antiparallel β-sheet encompassing residues 26–33 of subunit ε packs in a space between neighboring polar loops of the subunitc oligomer. The plasmids constructed in this study are derivatives of plasmid pYZ201 (25Zhang Y. Fillingame R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24609-24614Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), which carries the eight structural genes of unc operon coding F1F0 (bases 870–10172; Ref.40Walker J.E. Saraste M. Gay J.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 768: 164-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). 1The unc DNA numbering system corresponds to that used by Walker et al. (40Walker J.E. Saraste M. Gay J.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 768: 164-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). The Cys substitutions in subunit c and subunit ε were introduced by oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis using the strategy described previously (25Zhang Y. Fillingame R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24609-24614Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The plasmids were expressed in strain OM204 (41Fraga D. Hermolin J. Oldenburg M. Miller M.J. Fillingame R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7532-7537Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), a strain in which the unc operon is deleted from the chromosome. Cells were grown and membranes prepared by the methods described (25Zhang Y. Fillingame R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24609-24614Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). To catalyze disulfide bond formation, aliquots of 200-μl membrane vesicles at 10 mg/ml in TMG buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 10% (v/v) glycerol) were treated with 20 μl of a mixture of 15 mm CuSO4 and 45 mm 1,10-phenanthroline in 50% ethanol. After a 1-h incubation at room temperature, the reaction was stopped by addition of 20 μl of 0.5 m Na2EDTA and 20 μl of 0.5m N-ethylmaleimide (NEM) 2The abbreviations used are: NEM, N-ethylmaleimide; CuP, Cu(II) (phenanthroline)2; Tricine, N-tris(hydroxymethyl)methylglycine in dimethyl sulfoxide, and the sample was incubated for a further 60 min. The sample was then diluted with 230 μl of 2× SDS sample buffer (125 mmTris-HCl, pH 6.8, 4% SDS, 20% glycerol, and 0.02% bromphenol blue) and incubated at 30 °C for 1 h. The solubilized membrane proteins were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis using a 7.5–15% acrylamide gradient and the Tris-Tricine buffer described by Schägger and von Jagow (42Schägger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10505) Google Scholar). After electrophoretic transfer to nitrocellulose paper (43Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44939) Google Scholar), immunostaining was carried out using the Enhanced Chemiluminescence System (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The rabbit antiserum to subunit c used was that described by Girvin et al. (44Girvin M.E. Hermolin J. Pottorf R. Fillingame R.H. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 4340-4343Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Antibodies that nonspecifically cross-reacted with E. coli membrane proteins were removed by preabsorption with membranes prepared from a mutant strain with a deleted unc operon (44Girvin M.E.

A model for subunit c interaction in the c 12oligomer has been derived from the NMR model (27Girvin M.E. Rastogi V.K. Abildgaard F. Markley J.L. Fillingame R.H. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 8817-8824Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar) using distance constraints derived from the cross-linking data of Jones et al. (28Jones P.C. Jiang W. Fillingame R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17178-17185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). 3O. Y. Dmitriev, M. E. Girvin, P. C. Jones, and R. H. Fillingame, submitted for publication. A subunitc dimer, taken from the oligomer model, was manually docked to the N-terminal domain of subunit ε (residues 1–87) so that the distances between the α-carbons of cross-linked residues were <12 Å. The range for α-carbon distances in naturally occurring disulfide bonds in proteins is 4–7.5 Å (46Richardson J.S. Richardson D.C. Fasman G. Prediction of Protein Structure and the Principles of Protein Conformation. Plenum Press, NY1989: 1-98Crossref Google Scholar). A somewhat wider distance constraint range of 4–11 Å was used in the molecular mechanics calculations done here to allow for possible thermal motions and distortions of structure on cross-link formation. The shortest of the two distances between the Cys α-carbon in each of the two subunitsc and the Cys α-carbon in ε in the manually docked structure was used to impose a distance constraint. The positions of all the atoms of the c subunits were fixed except for residues 39–45, which were left unrestrained. The backbone angles in subunit ε were restrained to their value in the x-ray structure (39Uhlin U. Cox G.B. Guss J.M. Structure (Lond.). 1997; 5: 1219-1230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar) using quadratic restraints. Energy minimization was performed with CVFF (constant valence force field) using the steepest descents and then conjugated gradient methods as implemented in DISCOVER 3.0 (Molecular Simulations Inc.) until the maximum derivative was below 0.1 kcal mol−1Å−1. 4A coordinate file of the final model is available by E-mail at [email protected] All of the mutants constructed grew on succinate minimal medium, which indicates formation of a functional ATP synthase (TableI). Two of the ε-substituted,cQ42C mutants showed very little membrane ATPase activity and nondetectable amounts of ε subunit on immunoblotting (Table I). In these two cases, εV25C/cQ42C and εG27C/cQ42C, we conclude that the F1-F0 interaction is probably stable underin vivo conditions but that the F1-ATPase and ε subunit disassociate from the membrane during membrane preparation.Table ICross-linking of cysteine-substituted ε subunits to Q42C subunit cSubstitution in subunit εGrowth on succinatebColony size on succinate minimal medium after 64 h of growth.ATPase activityaMembrane ATPase activity was measured in 50 mm Tris-H2SO4, pH 7.8, 0.2 mmMgSO4, 0.4 mm [γ-32P]ATP.

Open table in a new tab We had previously shown that Cys at position 31 in subunit ε cross-links with Cys in positions 40, 42, or 43 in the polar loop of subunit c (25Zhang Y. Fillingame R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24609-24614Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). In this study, Cys was substituted in a series of positions proximal to position 31 in subunit ε, and cross-link formation was tested with Cys at position 42 in subunit c. An experiment comparing cross-linking incQ42C/εE29C and cQ42C/εE31C mutant membranes illustrates a number of typical features (Fig.1). An ε-c cross-linked product was observed in membranes prepared from both mutants. The cross-linked product identified as ε-c was found at an identical position on blots stained with either anti-ε or anti-c antibody. 5A number of minor bands were also detected with the anti-ε antibody, the intensity and number of which vary from experiment to experiment. They appear to be artifactual because similar bands are detected in mutant membranes lacking subunit ε. Most of the proteins reacting nonspecifically are removed by the stripping procedure used to remove F1, i.e. washing membranes with 1 mm Tris-HCl and 0.5 mm EDTA, but this treatment also removes monomeric ε (see Fig. 2). Comigration of the product on the two types of blots was confirmed using several types of gels of varying acrylamide concentration. The ε-c product seen in untreated membranes is presumed to form by autoxidation as the membranes are isolated from the cell. The extent of cross-link formation was enhanced by Cu(II)(phenanthroline)2 (CuP) catalyzed oxidation. Cross-linking was largely reversed by subsequent treatment with 0.5 mm dithiothreitol. The intensity of the ε-c-immunostained product that is detected with anti-ε antibody does prove to be misleading. Beginning with the anti-ε blot shown in Fig. 1, note the much greater intensity of staining of the ε-c product in cQ42C/εE29Cversus cQ42C/εE31C membranes despite the loading of equal amounts of membrane protein in all lanes. Note also for the εE29C membranes that the changes in intensity of ε-c are considerably greater than the changes in intensity of monomeric ε, i.e. the changes are not in the inverse proportions expected in a precursor-product relationship. We interpret this to mean that the ε-c heterodimer of the εE29C mutant protein binds antibody better than the εE29C monomer and also better than the ε-c heterodimer of the εE31C mutant. This interpretation is qualitatively confirmed by the relative intensities of the bands on the anti-c blot. In the untreated membrane samples, the intensity of the anti-cimmunostained ε-c product is much greater for εE31C than for εE29C, i.e. just the reverse of the pattern seen with anti-ε antibody. We have concluded that the best way to approximate the extent of ε-c formation may be to compare the amounts of monomeric ε remaining after various treatments. Using this criteria, the εE31C mutant would appear to form at least as much and possibly more ε-c product by either autoxidation or CuP-catalyzed oxidation. Other mutants also show ε-c products whose staining intensities differ considerably with the two antibodies. In the experiment shown in Fig. 2, membranes were washed with 1 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.5 mmNa2EDTA, a procedure which removes F1 and uncross-linked subunit ε and other nonspecific immunoreactive proteins. The εS28C, εE29C and εG30C ε-c products stain much more intensely with anti-ε antibody than with anti-c antibody. Conversely, the ε-c product in the εG33C mutant stains much less intensely with anti-ε body than with anti-c antibody. Other ε-c products stain with nearly equivalent intensities in the two blots. In summary, the blots do not provide a good quantitative means of distinguishing the extent of cross-link formation in different mutant membranes. A survey of ε-c cross-linking in a series of double-Cys-substituted pairs is shown in Fig.3. In the presence of CuP, most or all of the Cys-substituted subunit ε was cross-linked with Cys42-substituted subunit c when Cys was substituted as positions 26, 28, 29, 30, 32, and 33 in subunit ε. Detectable cross-linking also occurred in the absence of CuP in each of these mutants. No cross-linking was observed with Cys substituted at positions 24, 25, 27, 34 and 38 of subunit ε. In the case of the εV25C mutant, subunit ε was not incorporated into the membrane. This was also the case for the εG27C mutant (not shown). In other experiments, the cQ42C/εS10C pair was also shown to not form a cross-link (Table I). Most of the ε-c-cross-linked product formed in the various membranes shown in Fig. 3 was reduced by treatment with dithiothreitol. The results from several similar experiments are summarized in Table I. In the NMR structure of subunit c, Gln42 lies on a flattened face of the loop region opposite Ala40 and Asp44. We introduced Cys into positions 40 and 44 of the loop to see if the pattern of cross-linking to residues surrounding εGlu31 differed from that with Cys at cQ42C. As shown in Fig. 4, Cys substituted at either position 40 or 42 was readily cross-linked to Cys at positions 28, 31, and 32 of subunit ε. We conclude that subunit ε must be able to interact with either face of the loop region when it binds to the oligomer of subunit c. The surface of subunit ε lying proximal to subunit chas been mapped by cross-linking experiments to a region encompassing residues 26–33, which in the NMR and x-ray diffraction structures of subunit ε (38Wilkens S. Dahlquist F.W. McIntosh L.P. Donaldson L.W. Capaldi R.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 961-967Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 39Uhlin U. Cox G.B. Guss J.M.

The NMR and x-ray diffraction structures agree closely and show subunit ε to be a protein of two distinct domains. The N-terminal domain of 86 residues folds in a 10-stranded β-sandwich and the C-terminal domain of 45 residues is formed from two α-helices arranged in an antiparallel coiled coil. Much of the C-terminal domain appears to be nonessential because it can be deleted without effect on ATP synthase function (47Kuki M. Noumi T. Maeda M. Amemura A. Futai M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 17437-17442Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).

Residue 31 of ε must also lie proximal to the surface of F0because the εE31C-substituted protein can be cross-linked to Cys at positions 40, 42, and 43 of subunit c (25Zhang Y. Fillingame R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24609-24614Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The loop including residues 26–33 protrudes from the “bottom” of subunit ε as a well defined lobe (Fig. 5 A), and most Cys replacements in this loop were cross-linked to Q42C subunitc in the experiments described here. In addition, Cys at positions 28, 31, and 32 in subunit ε were shown to cross-link to Cys lying on opposing flattened faces of the polar loop of subunitc in the NMR structure (Ref. 27Girvin M.E. Rastogi V.K. Abildgaard F. Markley J.L. Fillingame R.H. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 8817-8824Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar; Fig. 5 B),i.e. at either position 42 or at positions 40 and 44 in the loop. The interacting surfaces of subunit ε and subunit c have been modeled beginning with a model for the c 12oligomer described elsewhere.3 In the modeling, equivalent distance constraints were imposed for each cross-link formed because of difficulties in quantitatively distinguishing the extent of cross-link formation. In the model, the loop of antiparallel β-sheet that is centered around εGlu29 packs between the polar loops of two c subunits (Fig.6 A). The model also depicts the εGlu31 residue lying close enough to the conserved and essential cArg41 residue to interact electrostatically and also close to cGln42 (Fig.6 B). The positioning of these side chains in the model should be interpreted with caution because the model is derived without use of side chain distance constraints. However, with these precautions, the general proximity of residues in the model does provide a reasonable explanation for the uncoupling effects of thecQ42E mutation (23Mosher M.E. White L.K. Hermolin J. Fillingame R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 4807-4814Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in that charge-charge repulsion would be expected between the cGlu42 and εGlu31 carboxylates. The charge-charge repulsion explanation is supported by the differences in pH dependence of neutralversus positively charged ε-31 suppressor substitutions in restoring function to the cQ42E mutant (24Zhang Y. Oldenburg M. Fillingame R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10221-10224Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The smaller uncoupling effects of some substitutions in εGlu31 (49LaRoe D.J. Vik S.B. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 633-637Crossref PubMed Google Scholar),versus the cQ42E mutation, are not as easily rationalized by the model. In the model shown in Fig. 6 A, it is notable that the space between loops of subunit c is essentially filled by the packing with subunit ε. Because residue 205 of subunit γ is also known to cross-link with residues 42, 43, and 44 of subunitc (14Watts S.D. Teng C. Capaldi R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28341-28347Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 26Watts S.D. Zhang Y. Fillingame R.H. Capaldi R.A. FEBS Lett. 1995; 368: 235-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), it seems likely that the region around γ-205 packs between a different set of c subunits than those interacting with ε. The shielding of two separate pairs of subunitc by the binding of subunits γ and ε, respectively, may explain the observations of Watts and Capaldi (50Watts S.D. Capaldi R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15065-15068Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) on the functional effects of NEM modification of Cys42 in cQ42C mutant membranes. Function was retained during the initial phase of modification of approximately 60% of the subunits and then lost during modification of the last 40%. The inhibitory phase of NEM modification may correspond to reaction with Cys42 at thec-γ-c or c-ε-cinterfaces. In the currently envisioned rotary models, subunits γ and ε remain fixed to a set of c subunits and turn as thec-oligomer rotates (14Watts S.D. Teng C. Capaldi R.A. J. Biol.

The binding interaction must be of sufficient strength to withstand a considerable torque, estimated at exceeding 40 pN nm under load, or approximately 12 kcal mol−1 for each 120° step in which ATP is synthesized (8Yasuda R.

Recent studies have shown that the gene product, ELL, functions as an RNA polymerase II elongation factor that increases the rate of transcription by RNA polymerase II by suppressing transient pausing. Using yeast two-hybrid screening with ELL as bait, we isolated the p53 tumor suppressor protein as a specific interactor of ELL. The interaction involves respectively the transcription elongation activation domain of ELL and the C-terminal tail of p53. Through this interaction, ELL inhibits both sequence-specific transactivation and sequence-independent transrepression by p53. Thus, ELL acts as a negative regulator of p53 in transcription. Conversely, p53 inhibits the transcription elongation activity of ELL, suggesting that p53 is capable of regulating general transcription by RNA polymerase II through controlling the ELL activity. Elevated levels of ELL in cells resulted in the inhibition of p53-dependent induction of endogenous p21 and substantially protected cells from p53-mediated apoptosis that is induced by genotoxic stress. Our observations indicate the existence of a mutually inhibitory interaction between p53 and a general transcription elongation factor ELL and raise the possibility that an aberrant interaction between p53 and ELL may play a role in the genesis of leukemias carrying MLL-ELL gene translocations.

The ELL gene (also known as MEN) was molecularly identified as a gene that was fused to the Drosophilatrithorax-like MLL gene (also calledALL-1 or Hrx) in acute myeloid leukemia carrying the t(11;19)(q23;p13.1) chromosomal translocation (1Mitani K.

Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12110-12114Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). The gene product, ELL, was recently demonstrated to function as an RNA polymerase II elongation factor that increases the overall rate of transcription elongation by RNA polymerase II via suppression of transient pausing by the polymerase at many sites along DNA (3Shilatifard A. Lane W.S. Jackson K.W. Conaway R.C. Conaway J.W. Science. 1996; 271: 1873-1876Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). The connection between transcription elongation factors and oncogenesis was first provided by the finding that the product of VHLtumor suppressor gene, VHL, associates with the complex of the B and C regulatory subunits of another transcription elongation factor, elongin (4Duan D.R. Pause A. Burgess W.H. Aso T. Chen D.Y.T. Garrett K.P. Conaway R.C. Conaway J.W. Linehan W.M. Klausner R.D. Science. 1995; 269: 1402-1406Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar, 5Kibel A. Iliopoulos O. DeCaprio J.A. Kaelin Jr., W.G. Science. 1995; 269: 1444-1446Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar). Binding of VHL to the elongin BC complex inhibits its ability to activate elongin A subunit in transcription elongation. The observation that many of the naturally occurring VHL mutants exhibit substantially reduced binding to the elongin BC complexes led to the suggestion that tumor suppression by VHL may involve negative regulation of elongin as a transcription elongation factor. ELL is the second transcription elongation factor found associated with human malignancy. The chimeric protein generated by MLL-ELLgene translocation contains an N-terminal AT-hook DNA binding domain and the methyltransferase-like domain of MLL that is fused to almost the entire ELL sequences (1Mitani K. Kanda Y. Ogawa S. Tanaka T. Inazawa J. Yazaki Y. Hirai H. Blood. 1995; 85: 2017-2024Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Thirman M.J. Levitan D.A. Kobayashi H. Simon M.C. Rowley J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Faha B. Seizinger B.R. Kley N. Nature. 1995; 377: 646-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (806) Google Scholar). Transcriptional regulation of these genes by p53 explains at least in part the pleiotropic functions of p53 in cell growth control. This transcriptional activity of p53 is negatively regulated by the MDM2 protein (35Momand J. Zambetti G.P. Olson D.C. George D. Levine A.J.

These proteins bind to the N-terminal domain of p53 and inhibit its transcriptional activity. Recent studies further demonstrated that MDM2-p53 interaction accelerates the ubiquitin-mediated degradation of p53 (38Haupt Y. Maya R. Kazaz A. Oren M. Nature. 1997; 387: 296-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (3722) Google Scholar, 39Kubbutat M.H.G. Jones S.N. Vousden K.H. Nature. 1997; 387: 299-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (2847) Google Scholar). Common p53 mutants in tumors lack the sequence-specific DNA binding activity because of the point mutations in the DNA-binding core domain and, hence, cannot transactivate the p53-target genes (40Hollstein M. Rice K. Greenblatt M.S. Soussi T. Fuchs R. Sorlie T. Hovig E. Smith-Sorensen B. Montesano R. Harris C.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 3551-3555PubMed Google Scholar). p53 is also known to repress transcription from a wide variety of promoters that do not possess p53 binding/responsive elements (41Ginsberg D.

Although detailed mechanisms involved in this transrepression are not well understood, it appears to be mediated at least in part by the physical interaction between p53 and TATA-binding protein (TBP) 1The abbreviations used are: TBP, TATA-binding protein; HA, hemagglutinin; Tc, tetracycline; IPTG, isopropyl-β-thiogalactopyranoside; GST, glutathioneS-transferase; CMV, cytomegalovirus (47Liu X.

However, the observation that additional molecules other than TBP are also required for the transrepression by p53 (51Farmer G. Friedlander P. Colgan J. Manley J.L. Prives C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 4281-4288Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) indicates that p53 may sequester factors that are necessary for efficient initiation and/or elongation of RNA polymerase II-dependent transcription in addition to TBP. In order to understand the mechanisms through which the ELL transcription elongation factor affects human malignancy, we have investigated molecules that physically interact with ELL. In this report, we show that p53 specifically binds ELL. Through the interaction, ELL reduces the transcriptional capacity of p53, as well as its action as a general transcriptional repressor. Conversely, p53 binding blocks the transcription elongation activity of ELL. Furthermore, elevated levels of ELL in cells inhibit p53-dependent induction of p21 and protect cells from p53-mediated apoptosis. Our results indicate the existence of mutually inhibitory interaction between p53 and ELL and raise the possibility that aberrant interaction between p53 and ELL may be involved in leukemogenesis associated with MLL-ELL gene translocation. ELL cDNA was amplified from human cDNA library by standard polymerase chain reaction, and the sequence of entire coding region was confirmed. Bait plasmid was constructed in pAS2C, a CEN-ARS version of pAS2, using full-length ELL cDNA. Yeast two-hybrid screening of a human B cell cDNA library was performed in the yeast strain Y190. A cDNA encoding the N-terminal Myc or hemagglutinin (HA) epitope-tagged human ELL (Myc-ELL or HA-ELL) was constructed by using polymerase chain reaction technique and was cloned into pcDNA3 or pSP65SRα2 vector. Mammalian expression vectors pcDNA3-p53, pcDNA3-ELL, pcDNA3-mdm2, pcDNA3-hdm, and pcDNA3-β-galactosidase were constructed by inserting cDNAs encoding human p53, human ELL, mouse MDM2, human homologue of MDM2 (HDM2), and β-galactosidase, respectively, into pcDNA3. pOPTET vector is an inducible cDNA expression vector containing TcIP promoter, a modified tetracycline-regulatable promoter consisting of the tetracycline-repressible enhancer element and the lac operator (52Gossen M. Bujard H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5547-5551Crossref PubMed Scopus (4256) Google Scholar, 53Hoshikawa Y. Amimoto K. Mizuguchi R. Hatakeyama M. Anal. Biochem. 1998; 261: 211-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). cDNA expression from the TcIP promoter is repressed by tetracycline (Tc) and is strongly induced by the lactose analog, isopropyl-β-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) in cells that ectopically express the Tc-repressible transactivator (tTA) and the lacrepressor (LacI). A cDNA encoding p53, ELL, or mutant ELL was cloned into pOPTET vector. COS-7, L929, and SAOS-2 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. SAOS-2-derived clone 3 (SAOS-2/clone-3) cell was generated by stably introducing expression plasmids for tTA and LacI by calcium-phosphate method. The 6-1 cell is a BaF3-derived mouse pro-B cell line that stably co-express tTA and LacI (53Hoshikawa Y. Amimoto K. Mizuguchi R. Hatakeyama M. Anal.

Cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% fetal calf serum and 20% WEHI-3B-conditioned medium (20% WEHI) as a source of interleukin 3. Stable transfectants that conditionally express Myc-ELL was created by transfecting pOPTET-Myc-ELL by electroporation as described (53Hoshikawa Y. Amimoto K. Mizuguchi R. Hatakeyama M. Anal. Biochem. 1998; 261: 211-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Expression of Myc-ELL protein in these transfectants was repressed in medium containing 1 μg/ml Tc and was induced in medium containing 5 mm IPTG in the absence of Tc. Cells were transfected with various combinations of expression vectors (2 μg each) using the DEAE-dextran method for COS-7 or the calcium-phosphate method for L929 or SAOS-2 and were lysed after 72 h in ELB buffer (250 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 50 mmHEPES, pH 7.0, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin). Lysates were then immunoprecipitated with anti-Myc (9E10) or anti-p53 (PAb1801, NEO MARKERS) mouse monoclonal antibody. Immunoprecipitates were recovered on protein A-agarose, washed five times with ELB buffer, eluted by boiling in SDS-containing sample buffer, resolved by electrophoresis in a 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, transferred to PVDF membrane filters, and probed with goat anti-p53 polyclonal IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, no. sc-1314) or anti-Myc (9E10). Immunoblots were visualized using donkey anti-goat IgG or anti-mouse IgG secondary antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase followed by chemiluminescence detection. SAOS-2 cells were grown on slide flasks and transfected with pcDNA3-HA-ELL and/or pcDNA3-p53 using calcium-phosphate method. Two days after the transfection, cells were processed for immunofluorescence. The primary antibodies were rabbit anti-HA IgG and anti-p53 monoclonal antibody (Pab1801). The secondary antibodies were Texas red-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG and FITC-conjugated anti-mouse IgG. cDNAs encoding entire human ELL and p53 were respectively subcloned into theEscherichia coli expression plasmid pGEX-5X-1 and pGEX-3X. Recombinant GST-ELL and GST-p53 fusion proteins were affinity purified from bacterial cell extracts by incubating with 25 μl of glutathione-Sepharose beads in suspension for 30 min on ice. Beads were washed six times with NETN (20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40). Similarly, portions of ELL or p53 were expressed as GST fusion proteins in E. coli. Protein concentration was determined using the Bradford protein assay (Bio-Rad). 10× histidine-tagged human ELL (His-ELL) was overexpressed in E. coli with pET16b vector, and the recombinant ELL was purified according to the previously described method (3Shilatifard A. Lane W.S. Jackson K.W. Conaway R.C. Conaway J.W. Science. 1996; 271: 1873-1876Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). The purity of the recombinant protein was assessed by Coomassie Blue staining of SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gels, and each of the recombinant proteins was detected as a single major band with the expected molecular weight. Full-length or portions ofELL or p53 cDNAs subcloned into pcDNA3 vector were used for in vitro transcription and translation (TNT coupled transcription/translation system, Promega). Immobilized GST fusion protein (5 μg) was mixed with 5 μl of in vitro translated [35S]methionine-labeled lysate and incubated for 30 min at 4 °C. The beads were then washed six times with NETN. Bound protein was separated on a 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and detected by fluorography. Plasmids were transiently transfected into the SAOS-2 or SAOS-2/clone-3 cells (2 × 106) by calcium-phosphate method. For inducible cDNA expression with the use of pOPTET vector, transfected cells were split into two 60-mm dishes (5 ml each). To each plate, either Tc (final concentration, 1 μg/ml) or IPTG (final concentration, 5 mm) was added. Luciferase assays were performed 48 h after the transfection. The luciferase activities of equal amounts of the extracted proteins were measured by Lumat 9507 luminometer (Berthold). The oligo(dC)-tailed template assay was performed with the use of pCpGR220A/P/X plasmid (100 ng) and RNA polymerase (0.01unit) according to the method described (3Shilatifard A. Lane W.S. Jackson K.W. Conaway R.C. Conaway J.W. Science. 1996; 271: 1873-1876Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). After 25 min of incubation, 100 μm cold CTP, 2 μm UTP and GST-ELL (100 ng), or His-ELL (600 ng) was added with or without 800 ng of GST-p53, and the reactions were further incubated. RNA transcripts were analyzed by electrophoresis through 6% polyacrylamide/7 m urea gels. To isolate molecules that interact with ELL, we employed a yeast two-hybrid screen using ELL as a bait. By screening 6.5 × 106independent cDNA clones prepared from an Epstein-Barr virus transformed human B lymphocyte library, we isolated cDNA encoding nearly full-length p53 that lacked the N-terminal 3 and the C-terminal 2 amino acids. This two-hybrid interaction was abolished by deleting 47 amino acids from the C terminus of p53. 2N. Shinobu, T. Maeda, and M. Hatakeyama, unpublished observations. The association of ELL and p53 in mammalian cells was then addressed by assessing the interaction of transiently expressed Myc-ELL with endogenous p53. In COS-7 cells expressing Myc-ELL, co-immunoprecipitation of endogenous p53 with ELL was readily detectable. Reciprocally, co-immunoprecipitation of ELL with endogenous p53 was detectable when the same lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-p53 (Fig. 1 A). Because COS-7 cells express SV40 large T antigen, which forms a complex with p53, we also examined the p53-ELL interaction in SAOS-2 human osteosarcoma cell or L929 mouse fibroblast cell, both of which do not possess SV40 large T antigen. Upon transient expression of p53 and Myc-ELL, reciprocal co-immunoprecipitation of ELL and p53 was again demonstrated in these cells (Fig. 1, B and C). In the absence of antibodies that specifically recognize ELL, it was impossible to examine the interaction between endogenous ELL and p53. The intracellular localization of p53 and ELL was next examined by co-expressing p53 and HA-ELL in SAOS-2 cells, which lack endogenous p53 (Fig.2). Transfected SAOS-2 cells were doubly stained with anti-p53 (green) and anti-HA (red). As described previously, ELL was expressed diffusely in the nucleus but excluded from the nucleoli (55Thirman M.J. Diskin E.B. Bin S.S. Ip H.S. Miller J.M. Simon M.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1408-1413Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Anti-p53 staining showed nuclear staining that was almost indistinguishable from that of ELL. Merging the two images produced yellow, suggesting co-localization of the two proteins in the nucleus. In order to further characterize the ELL-p53 interaction, in vitrobinding assays were performed using p53 fused with glutathioneS-transferase (GST-p53) and in vitro-translated,35S-labeled ELL protein. As demonstrated in Fig.3 A, ELL was specifically bound to immobilized GST-p53. 35S-Labeled p53 protein that forms oligomers with GST-p53 was used as a positive control. Reciprocally,in vitro-translated p53 was specifically bound to immobilized GST-ELL (Fig. 3 B). Addition of RNase A to the binding reaction did not affect the formation of ELL-p53 complexes, excluding the possible involvement of RNA in this interaction. A direct interaction between ELL and p53 was also demonstrated by far Western blotting analysis using histidine-tagged ELL (His-ELL) as a protein probe (Fig. 3 C). Various deletion derivatives of p53 were used to map the part of p53 that is required for ELL binding. In accordance with the observed yeast two-hybrid interaction, GST-ELL did not bind p53 that lacks the C-terminal 47 amino acids (Fig. 4 A, lane 2). Likewise, GST-p53 lacking the C-terminal 47 amino acids of p53 failed to bind ELL (Fig. 4 B, lane 4). The results indicate that the C-terminal 47 amino acids of p53 are required for ELL binding. Analysis using deletion derivatives of ELL revealed that a C-terminally truncated mutant, ELL(1–363), retained the ability to bind p53 (Fig.4 C, lane 3). However, further C-terminal deletion to residue 250 decreased binding significantly. Internal deletion of ELL between residues 35 and 249 strongly impaired p53 binding and further deletion completely abolished the interaction (Fig. 4 C, lanes 9 and11). The results indicate that the N-terminal half of ELL, a region where the transcription elongation factor activity resides (56Shilatifard A. Haque D. Conaway R.C. Conaway J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22355-22363Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), is required for its binding with p53. Because the C terminus of p53, to which ELL binds, is known to be important for its transcriptional activity (19Crook T. Marston N.J. Sara E.A. Vousden K.H. Cell. 1994; 79: 817-827Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 20Fields S. Jang S.K. Science. 1990; 249: 1046-1049Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar, 21Pietenpol J.A.

Science. 1990; 249: 1049-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar), we next examined whether ELL is capable of inhibiting p53-mediated transactivation of promoters containing p53-responsive elements. To this end, a transient luciferase reporter assay was conducted in SAOS-2 cells using RGC-, cyclin G-, or MDM2-promoter luciferase construct (28Wu X. Bayle J.H. Olson D. Levine A.J. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1126-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (1642) Google Scholar, 31Okamoto K. Beach D. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4816-4822Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar, 57Kern S.E. Kinzler K.W. Bruskin A. Jarosz D. Friedman P. Prives C. Vogelstein B. Science. 1991; 252: 1708-1711Crossref PubMed Scopus (937) Google Scholar). As demonstrated in Fig.5 A, the p53-dependent transactivation of the RGCpromoter was strongly repressed by co-expressing ELL. The inhibition was comparable to that induced by MDM2 or HDM2 (the human homologue of MDM2) under the experimental conditions employed. The effects of ELL on p53-responsive promoters were also examined by using an inducible cDNA expression system (53Hoshikawa Y. Amimoto K. Mizuguchi R. Hatakeyama M. Anal. Biochem. 1998; 261: 211-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) in SAOS-2 cells. Again, induced expression of ELL inhibited the p53-dependent transactivation, whereas an ELL mutant that cannot interact with p53 failed to do so (Fig. 5, B and C). However, in contrast to MDM2 (38Haupt Y. Maya R. Kazaz A. Oren M. Nature. 1997; 387: 296-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (3722) Google Scholar, 39Kubbutat M.H.G. Jones S.N. Vousden K.H. Nature. 1997; 387: 299-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (2847) Google Scholar), expression of ELL did not reduce the expression levels of p53 as examined by anti-p53 immunoblotting.2 Hence, the results indicate that ELL inhibits the sequence-specific transactivation by p53 through the complex formation with p53. In addition to acting as a transactivator, p53 represses the activity of a variety of promoters lacking p53-binding sites (41Ginsberg D. Mechta F. Yaniv M. Oren M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

https://openalex.org/W2078800044,"The toxin (Doc) and antidote (Phd) proteins of the plasmid addiction system of bacteriophage P1 were purified as a complex. Cocrystals of the complex contained a 2:1 molar ratio of Phd:Doc as assayed by dye binding following SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and as determined by amino acid analysis. Gel filtration and analytical ultracentrifugation revealed that the two addiction proteins interact in solution to form a P2D trimer composed of one Doc and two Phd molecules. These results support a model in which Phd inhibits the toxic activity of Doc by direct binding. Circular dichroism experiments showed that changes in secondary structure accompany formation of the heterotrimeric complex, raising the possibility that Phd may act by an allosteric mechanism. Studies of Phd and Doc molecules labeled with fluorescent energy donor and acceptor groups gave an equilibrium dissociation constant of about 0.8 μm2 and a very short, sub second half-life of complex dissociation. As a consequence, low concentrations of free Doc toxin are likely to be present both transiently and in the steady state in cells containing the Phd antidote, making mechanisms of single-hit Doc toxicity improbable.

As a consequence, low concentrations of free Doc toxin are likely to be present both transiently and in the steady state in cells containing the Phd antidote, making mechanisms of single-hit Doc toxicity improbable. The plasmid addiction system of bacteriophage P1 consists of two proteins: a toxin known as Doc (death oncure) and an antidote named Phd (preventhost death) (1Lehnherr H. Maguin E. Jafri S. Yarmolinsky M.B. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 233: 414-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Bacteriophage P1 lysogenizesEscherichia coli as a low copy plasmid that is inherited in a remarkably stable fashion, in part, because the plasmid addiction system kills cells that have lost the P1 genome (1Lehnherr H. Maguin E. Jafri S. Yarmolinsky M.B. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 233: 414-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 2Rosner J.L.

The mechanism of Doc toxicity is unknown. Phd is, however, known to be degraded in a fashion dependent on the host ClpXP protease system, and continual synthesis of Phd is therefore required to counteract Doc toxicity (3Lehnherr H. Yarmolinsky M.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3274-3277Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). In daughter cells that have lost the P1 genome, degradation of Phd eventually results in reduction of antidote activity to a level where the host is killed. Phd may exert its antitoxin activity by binding Doc and physically blocking its interaction with cellular target molecules (1Lehnherr H. Maguin E. Jafri S. Yarmolinsky M.B. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 233: 414-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar) or by acting in an allosteric fashion to alter Doc structure and toxin activity. Alternatively, Phd might exert its antidote activity indirectly by activating another protein that neutralizes Doc. Some of the regulatory and biochemical properties of Phd have been established. For example, Phd is a DNA-binding protein that represses transcription of its own gene as well as that of Doc by binding to an operator DNA site that overlaps the addiction promoter (4Magnuson R. Lehnherr H. Mukhopadhyay G. Yarmolinsky M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18705-18710Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Four molecules of Phd bind to the intact operator with dimers binding to adjacent 10-base pair subsites (6Gazit E. Sauer R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2652-2657Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Phd has a predominantly α-helical structure when bound to DNA or at low temperatures but the free monomeric protein has a T m of 25 °C and is largely denatured at 37 °C (6Gazit E. Sauer R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2652-2657Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Addiction systems involving a stable toxin and proteolytically unstable antidote are also used by other low copy plasmids and may be involved in the regulation of programmed cell death in E. coli(7Loh S.M.

Although direct interaction between the toxin and its antidote is assumed to be the mechanism of inhibition for each of these systems, experimental evidence for complex formation has been presented only for the CcdA antidote and CcdB toxin of the F plasmid of E. coli(14Van Melderen L.

In the study of the phage P1 addiction proteins presented here, we demonstrate that Phd binds directly to Doc, forming a trimeric complex (P2D) with one molecule of Doc and two molecules of Phd. Complex formation appears to be accompanied by changes in secondary structure. P2D complexes form at low micromolar concentrations and are very short lived, ensuring a dynamic equilibrium between bound and free forms within the cell. E. colistrain X90/pRDM032, which expresses Phd and Doc underP tac control (4Magnuson R. Lehnherr H. Mukhopadhyay G. Yarmolinsky M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18705-18710Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), was grown at 37 °C to anA 600 of approximately 0.7 in Luria-Bertani broth containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin, and protein expression was induced by the addition of 100 μg/ml isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 30 min. Cells were harvested by centrifugation (3,500 × g for 30 min at 4 °C), and the pellets were frozen at −80 °C before purification. Cell pellets were thawed at 4 °C, resuspended in buffer A (50 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 1 mm EDTA), and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride was added to a final concentration of 50 μm. Cells were lysed by sonication, and the resulting solution was centrifuged at 4 °C for 10 min at 13,000 × g. The supernatant was applied to a MonoS HR 5/5 FPLC column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated in buffer A, which was eluted with gradient from 50 to 1,000 mm NaCl in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4. Elution was monitored by A 280. A peak containing Phd and Doc eluted at approximately 600 mm NaCl. This peak was applied to a semi-preparative reverse-phase C18 column, and Phd and Doc were separated using a gradient from 0 to 80% acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoracetic acid. Following this step, the proteins were greater than 95% pure as assessed by Coomassie staining of SDS-polyacrylamide gels. The masses of the purified proteins were determined by MALDI-TOF 1The abbreviations used are: MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time-of-flight; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography mass spectrometry using a Voyager-DE STR Biospectrometry Workstation (PerSeptive BioSystems) with sinapinic acid (3,5-dimethoxy-4-hydroxycinnamic acid) as the matrix, linear mode operation, a grid voltage at 91.0%, and a pulse delay time of 150 ns. Protein concentrations were determined by measuring tyrosine absorbance at both pH 7 and in 0.1 m KOH using a Hewlett Packard 8452A diode array spectrophotometer with extinction coefficients per tyrosine of 1,394m−1 cm−1 (274 nm at pH 7) and 2377 m−1 cm−1 (294 nm in 0.1m KOH) for Phd (1 Tyr) and Doc (4 Tyr). Circular dichroism spectra were obtained using an AVIV 60DS spectrapolarimeter equipped with a temperature-controlled sample holder and a 10-mm pathlength cuvette. Thermal denaturation experiments were performed in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 100 mmNaCl, and 0.1 mm EDTA; samples were equilibrated at 1 °C temperature intervals for 1 min, and the ellipticity at 222 nm was averaged for 2 min. Purified Phd protein was reacted with 2 equivalents of carboxytetramethylrhodamine succinimidyl ester (Molecular Probes, Eugene OR) in 0.5 mHEPES (pH 7), 100 mm NaCl, for 24 h at room temperature in the dark (15Gazit E. Burshtein N. Ellar D.J. Saywer T. Shai Y. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 15546-15554Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Doc was labeled in the same way except using carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester. Unreacted dyes were separated from labeled protein by gel filtration chromatography on a QuickSpin G-25 Sephadex column (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Equilibrium binding, assayed by fluorescence resonance energy transfer, was performed in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 100 mm NaCl, and 1 mm EDTA using a FluoroMax2 fluorescence spectrophotometer (Jobin Yvon • Spex, Edison, NJ). Kinetic experiments were performed using an Applied Photophysics DX17.MV stopped-flow instrument and were monitored by changes in fluorescence using a bandpass filter (520 ± 10 nm). Crystals of a Phd·Doc complex grew after several days at 4 °C from solutions containing purified protein at concentrations of 5 mg/ml or higher in 50 mm Tris·Cl (pH 8.0), 500 mm NaCl, and 1 mm EDTA. Individual crystals were thoroughly washed, boiled in SDS sample buffer, and analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, confirming the presence of both Phd and Doc in the crystals at 99% or higher purity. Amino acid analysis of washed and redisolved crystals was performed by the MIT Biopolymers laboratory. Analytical ultracentrifugation experiments were performed using a Beckman Optima XL-A centrifuge. Solutions containing Phd and Doc from dissolved crystals were centrifuged overnight at 15,000 rpm. After reaching equilibrium (established by unchanged A 274readings at 1 h intervals), absorbance profiles were determined at 274 nm, and five scans were averaged for analysis. Data from experiments in which ln(A) versus r 2plots showed curvature were fitted by nonlinear least-squares methods to a 2P + D ⇔ P2D equilbrium model using Eq. 1. (Eq. 1) where C r is the total concentration and the terms C b,x represent the concentrations of each species at a reference radial position. A x = (1 − υXρ)ω2/2RT, where υXis the partial specific volume of each species (calculated from its sequence), ρ is the solution density, ω is the rotor angular velocity in radians per second, R is the gas constant, andT is the absolute temperature. K d is the equilibrium dissociation constant, M x is the molecular mass of each species, r is the radial position,r b is a reference radial position, and ε is a small baseline correction term. This equation takes the relative extinction coefficients of Phd (one), Doc (four), and the P2D complex (six) into account. Gel filtration experiments were performed by chromatographing 200-μl samples on a 10 × 300 mm Superdex 75 HR 10/30 column (separation range 3–70 kDa) using a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. Absorbance was monitored at 280 nm, and the column was calibrated using gel filtration molecular weight standards (Bio-Rad). As a first step in studying potential interactions between Phd and Doc, both proteins were purified from E. coli strain X90/pRDM032, a cell expressing the phage P1 addiction proteins under P tac promoter control (4Magnuson R. Lehnherr H. Mukhopadhyay G. Yarmolinsky M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18705-18710Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1 A, Doc protein and the major portion of the Phd protein coeluted during ion-exchange chromatography on a MonoS column; a smaller quantity of Phd alone also eluted at a lower salt concentration than the Phd·Doc complex. During purification from cells without Doc, Phd eluted only in the low salt position. Further purification by reverse-phase HPLC chromatography under denaturing conditions separated Doc from Phd and resulted in purification of each protein to greater than 95% homogeneity (Fig. 1 B). The identity of each protein was confirmed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry (Fig.2). The observed masses (8,130 Da for Phd; 13,578 Da for Doc) are within 1 or 2 Da of those expected from the protein sequences, indicating that the formyl group of the N-terminal fMet residue is removed post-translationally for each protein.Figure 2MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry.HPLC-purified proteins have masses within 2 Da of those expected from the unmodified Phd (8,128 Da) and Doc (13,579 Da) protein sequences.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Solutions containing high concentrations of purified Phd and Doc formed needle-shaped crystals that grew to a length of several millimeters after 24–48 h at 4 °C (Fig.3 A). Following washing, SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis showed that individual crystals contained both Phd and Doc (Fig. 3 B). Densitometry of the Coomassie Blue-stained gel indicated that the Phd and Doc proteins were present in the crystal in a 2:1 molar ratio (Fig. 3 C). Amino acid analysis of protein from washed crystals also supported a 2:1 molar ratio of Phd:Doc in the crystals (TableI). Hence, in the crystalline state, Phd and Doc appear to form a macromolecular complex containing twice as many Phd molecules as Doc molecules. The smallest oligomer consistent with this stoichiometry is a P2D trimer, but P4D2 hexamers, P6D3nonamers, et cetera are also consistent with these data.Table IAmino acid analysis of dissolved co-crystalsAmino acidNumber of amino acids Doc:PhdTheoretical value 1:1 Doc:Phd ratioTheoretical value 1:2 Doc:Phd ratioExperimental valueAsx12 :9213030.7Glx11 :10213133.0Ser10 :5152018.5Gly10 :3131617.4Arg11 :6172325.3Thr7 :5121717.8Ala17 :9263534.9Pro4 :1566.8Tyr4 :1566.3Val9 :6152120.5Met2 :1344.7Ile8 :3111414.6Leu13 :6192525.8Phe4 :481212.9Lys1 :45910.4His3 :0333.0aHis value was used to normalize the measurement, because there are 3 histidines in Doc and none in Phd.a His value was used to normalize the measurement, because there are 3 histidines in Doc and none in Phd. Open table in a new tab In gel filtration chromatography on Superdex 75, purified Doc eluted at an approximate volume expected for a monomer (data not shown); Phd had been previously shown to be monomeric in solution (6Gazit E. Sauer R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2652-2657Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). To determine the solution form of Phd·Doc complexes, protein from dissolved cocrystals was also chromatographed on Superdex 75. At high loading concentrations (80 μm in Doc monomer equivalents), a major peak of approximately 30 kDa was observed (Fig. 4 A). This value is consistent with formation of a P2D solution trimer (expected molecular mass, 29.8 kDa). Some trailing asymmetry was evident in the Fig. 4 A column profile, suggesting that a small fraction of P2D complexes dissociated during chromatography. Indeed, when the sample was diluted 10-fold immediately before chromatography (loading concentration 8 μm in Doc monomer equivalents), less of the P2D peak was present and more prominent, lower molecular weight peaks corresponding to Doc and Phd alone were observed (data not shown). These experiments suggest that Phd·Doc complexes dissociate in the micromolar concentration range with kinetics on the time scale of minutes or faster. Gel filtration of a mixture of Phd:Doc in a 4:1 ratio revealed no species larger than 30 kDa but showed significant free Phd (data not shown). These results show that the P2D complex is the major solution form, even in the presence of excess Phd. As a second assay of solution oligomeric form, protein from dissolved Phd·Doc cocrystals (80 μm in Doc equivalents) was analyzed by analytical ultracentrifugation. These data were fit best by a 2:1 ratio of Phd:Doc and showed significant deviations from the behavior expected for 1:1 or 2:4 complexes of Phd:Doc (Fig.4 B). Equilibrium centrifugation experiments performed using lower protein concentrations (loading concentration of 20 μm in Doc equivalents) showed curvature in the ln(A 274) versus r 2 plot, indicative of some complex dissociation. Fitting of this data to a 2P + D ⇔ P2D model gave an equilibrium dissociation constant of 1.0 ± 0.3 μm2 at 20 °C (Fig. 4 C). The circular dichroism (CD) spectrum of purified Doc had features expected for a protein containing approximately 50% α-helix (Fig. 5 A). Melting experiments in a neutral buffer at protein concentrations of either 1 or 15 μm had similar shapes and midpoints (Fig.5 B), as expected if Doc is monomeric. The native structure of Doc (T m 60 °C) is quite stable in comparison to Phd (T m 25 °C) (6Gazit E. Sauer R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2652-2657Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). In fact, Phd is almost completely denatured at 37 °C, whereas Doc is native at this temperature. By comparing the CD spectra of a mixture of 2 μm Phd and 1 μm Doc with the summed spectra of the uncomplexed proteins, secondary structural changes induced by complex formation were assessed. At 4 °C, where Phd and Doc by themselves are both native, the mixture had slightly less ellipticity than the isolated proteins, suggesting that complex formation leads to some change in structure (Fig. 6 A). At 37 °C, where Phd by itself is primarily unfolded, the P2D complex had greater ellipticity than the individual proteins, suggesting an increase in secondary structure upon binding (Fig. 6 B). In the latter instance, it seems probable that at least a portion of Phd folds as it binds to Doc. Fitting of titration experiments, monitored by changes in CD ellipticity at 37 °C, gave an equilibrium dissociation constant of 0.7 ± 0.1 μm2 (Fig. 6 C). To study the affinity of complex formation by another method, we performed fluorescence resonance energy transfer experiments by titrating increasing amounts of rhodamine-labeled Doc (the acceptor molecule) against a constant amount of fluorescein-labeled Phd (the donor molecule). Because energy transfer depends on the inverse sixth power of the distance between the fluorescent dyes, any change in fluorescence should arise from interactions between the proteins. Fig.7 A shows fluorescence spectra, and Fig. 7 B shows the change in fluorescence at 25 °C as a function of Phd concentration. These experimental data were fit best by a binding curve calculated for a model 2P+D⇔P2DKd=[P]2[D]/[P2D]Equation 2 that is second-order in Phd and first-order in Doc, with an equilibrium dissociation constant of 0.83 ± 0.02 μm2. To determine the half-life of complex dissociation, fluorescently labeled P2D complexes were mixed with excess unlabeled Phd in a stopped-flow instrument, and the change in fluorescence was monitored (Fig. 7 C). The rate constant of this exchange process, which should be limited by dissociation was 42 (± 7) s−1 indicating that complex dissociation must occur very rapidly. Similar results were obtained when the dissociation reaction was initiated by mixing fluorescently labeled P2D complexes with unlabeled Doc. The rapid dissociation rate is consistent with the tailing seen in gel filtration. From the equilibrium constant and a dissociation rate constant, a third-order association rate constant of approximately 6·1013m−2s−1 can be calculated. Efficient inhibition of the toxic activity of Doc by the Phd antidote is essential for maintaining the viability of bacteriophage P1 lysogens of E. coli (1Lehnherr H. Maguin E. Jafri S. Yarmolinsky M.B. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 233: 414-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar) but little concrete information concerning the molecular mechanism of this inhibition has been available. The results presented here show that Phd and Doc interact directly to form a heterotrimeric complex in solution. In the absence of more detailed information, it is not possible to know whether formation of the Phd·Doc complex blocks the toxic activity of Doc by sterically occluding interactions with its cellular target or if formation of the complex alters the structure of Doc in a way that prevents this interaction. It is intriguing, however, that formation of the Phd·Doc complex appears to result in a small change in secondary structure. Were this alteration of structure to involve a portion of Doc, then this could serve as the mechanism of toxin neutralization. The Phd·Doc complex is a P2D heterotrimer. Heterotrimers are not common in biological systems and must be assembled asymmetrically. A well known example with a 2:1 ratio of components is the heterotrimer of growth hormone with two extracellular receptor domains, in which each receptor binds to a distinct surface of growth hormone (16de Vos A.M. Ultsch M. Kossiakoff A.A. Science. 1992; 255: 306-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (2029) Google Scholar). The oligomeric form of the antidote-toxin complex for theccd system is hexameric with two dimers of the toxin and one dimer of the antidote (14Van Melderen L. Thi M.H.D. Lecchi P. Gottesman S. Couturier M. Maurizi M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27730-27738Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar), but this architecture also requires asymmetric construction and, indeed, can be considered as a heterotrimer of dimers. We find it intriguing that there are 2:1 or 1:2 ratios of antidote:toxin in both the P1 addiction system and Fccd system. Whether these and other addiction systems share common structural features is not known. Because simultaneous three-body collisions between protein monomers of Phd and Doc is not a statistically viable mechanism of assembly, formation of the P2D complex must proceed either through a P2 or a PD intermediate. Neither of these dimeric species has been detected in solution, implying that if either species can form then it must be unstable and poorly populated at equilibrium. We note, however, that two monomers of Phd bind cooperatively to operator subsites, suggesting that Phd subunits interact with each other in the DNA-bound state (6Gazit E. Sauer R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2652-2657Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). It is also worth noting that the P2D solution complex may also be an active operator binding species; using a mutant form of Doc, Magnuson and Yarmolinsky (5Magnuson R. Yarmolinsky M.B. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 6342-6351Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have suggested that a 2:1 ratio of Phd:Doc night occur in operator complexes. The P2D complex of Phd and Doc is unstable by comparison with many macromolecular complexes. K d values for complex dissociation of 0.7–1.0 μm2 were obtained from analytical ultracentrifugation at 20 °C, from fluorescence resonance energy transfer at 25 °C, and from changes in CD ellipticity at 37 °C. Dissociation of unlabeled Phd·Doc complexes to free components was also observed in the micromolar concentration range by gel filtration. P2D complexes equilibrate with free subunits on a subsecond time scale in vitro, which should ensure rapid equilibration of the bound and free intracellular pools of Phd and Doc. There is an approximate 3-fold ratio of Phd to Doc in overproducing cells. Because the phd and doc genes are part of the same operon, a similar ratio would be expected in P1 lysogens. Moreover, because Phd represses its own synthesis and that of Doc (1Lehnherr H. Maguin E. Jafri S. Yarmolinsky M.B. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 233: 414-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 2Rosner J.L. Virology. 1972; 49: 679-680Crossref Scopus (225) Google Scholar, 3Lehnherr H. Yarmolinsky M.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Chem. 1996; 271: 18705-18710Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 5Magnuson R. Yarmolinsky M.B. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 6342-6351Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), P1 lysogens are unlikely to contain very high concentrations of either protein. To ensure 90–99.9% binding of Doc with aK d of 0.7–1.0 μm2, we calculate that the free Phd concentration would need to be from 2.2 to 36 μm (≈2,200 to 36,000 molecules/cell). However, under these conditions there would still be free Doc concentrations of 260–22 nm. Hence, it is important to view the Phd-Doc interaction as buffering the free concentration of Doc rather than eliminating free Doc from the cell. If the assumptions that underlie these rough calculations are sound, then free Doc at submicromolar levels must be relatively innocuous to cells. Otherwise, P1 lysogens would have a significant growth disadvantage relative to nonlysogens. However, higher levels of free Doc (presumably in the micromolar range) must be lethal for the plasmid addiction mechanism to function. These considerations make it extremely unlikely that the mechanism of Doc toxicity involves single hit enzymatic lethality and suggest that Doc may reversibly inhibit some required cellular activity in a cooperative fashion that results in a steep concentration dependence of toxicity. In P1 lysogens, Phd binding spares the cell from Doc-mediated killing (3Lehnherr H. Yarmolinsky M.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3274-3277Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). However, Doc binding induces structure in denatured Phd at physiological temperatures, and thus it seems likely that Doc binding would also help protect Phd from degradation. Degradation of Phd is mediated directly or indirectly by the ClpXP protease (3Lehnherr H. Yarmolinsky M.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3274-3277Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), which consists of ClpP protease subunits and regulatory ClpX ATPase subunits (17Wawrzynow A. Wojtkowiak D. Marszalek J. Banecki B.

Chem. 1998; 273: 12476-12481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). ClpX is responsible for substrate recognition by ClpXP and has been shown to recognize specific peptide sequences at the C termini of several substrate proteins (20Levchenko I. Smith C.K. Walsh N.P. Sauer R.T. Baker T.A. Cell. 1997; 91: 939-947Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 21Levchenko I. Yamauchi M. Baker T.A.

If ClpXP directly degrades Phd, then C-terminal substrate recognition is probably also involved. By this model, formation of the P2D complex with Doc could prevent degradation of Phd by sequestering C-terminal sequences required for ClpX recognition and perhaps by stabilizing at least some parts of Phd in a native structure. We note, however, that the rapid dissociation rate and relatively high equilibrium dissociation constant for P2D complexes makes it likely that a pool of free Phd, in a largely denatured form, is present even when Doc is present in P1 lysogens. If Phd were too good a substrate for ClpXP, then degradation of the free pool and mass action to produce more free Phd could lead to Doc toxicity even in lysogens. Hence, it seems likely that Phd should be a rather poor substrate for ClpXP. Indeed, in ClpXP+strains, Phd is degraded relatively slowly over the course of several cell generations (3Lehnherr H.

A. 1995; 92: 3274-3277Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar) We thank Alok Srivastava for help and advice, Roy Magnuson and Michael Yarmolinsky for pRDM032, and Carl Pabo, Harvey Lodish, and Tania Baker for use of equipment."

Fischer, C. Hösl, R. Huber, and A. Bacher, manuscript in preparation. This paper describes the properties of mutant enzymes with replacement of histidine 179. Enzymes were purchased from Boehringer Mannheim (Mannheim, Germany) and Sigma (Deisenhofen, Germany); GTP from Serva (Heidelberg, Germany); [U-13C6]glucose was purchased from Isotec (Miamisburg, Ohio),15NH4Cl from ABCR (Karlsruhe, Germany), and pteridine derivatives from Schircks Laboratories (Jona, Switzerland). Sodium [13C]formate, phosphoryl chloride, trimethyl phosphate, N,N-dimethylformamide, tri-n-butylamine, and pyrophosphoric acid were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. All other chemicals were reagent grade. Assay mixtures contained 100 mmTris hydrochloride, pH 8.5, 100 mm KCl, 2.5 mmEDTA, 1 mm GTP, and protein in a total volume of 450 μl. The mixtures were incubated at 37 °C, and 100-μl aliquots were retrieved at intervals. The formation of dihydroneopterin triphosphate and 2-amino-5-formylamino-6-ribofuranosylamino-4(3H)-pyrimidinone 5′-phosphate was monitored as follows. Aliquots of enzyme assay mixture were mixed with 30 μl of a solution containing 1% iodine and 2% KI in 1 m HCl. After incubation for 30 min at ambient temperature, excess iodine was reduced by addition of 0.11ml-ascorbic acid (10 μl). After adjustment to pH 8.5 by the addition of 1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, a solution (10 μl) containing 1.8 units of alkaline phosphatase, 0.2 μmol of MgCl2, and 0.26 μmol of ZnCl2 was added. The mixture was incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. The reaction was terminated by addition of trichloroacetic acid. Precipitate was removed by centrifugation. Neopterin was determined by HPLC 2The abbreviations used are: HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; HMQC, heteronuclear multiple quantum coherence; TOCSY, totally correlated spectroscopy as described earlier (11Nar H. Huber R. Auerbach G. Fischer M. Hösl C. Ritz H. Bracher A. Meining W. Eberhardt S. Bacher A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 12120-12125Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Aliquots (100 μl) of enzyme assay mixtures were mixed with 100 μl of 1 m HCl. The mixtures were incubated for 5 min at 90 °C. The pH was adjusted to 8.5 by the addition of 1m NaOH. Butanedione in 1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, was added to a final concentration of 0.5%. The mixtures were incubated at 90 °C for 1 h. 6,7-Dimethylpterin was determined by HPLC as described previously (16Richter G. Ritz H. Katzenmeier G. Volk R. Kohnle A. Lottspeich F. Allendorf D. Bacher A. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 4045-4051Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). [8-13C]Guanine was prepared by the route used for [7-15N,8-13C]guanine as described earlier (17Rieder C. Eisenreich W. O'Brien J. Richter G. Götze E. Boyle P. Blanchard S. Bacher A. Simon H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 255: 24-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), except that unlabeled sodium nitrite was used. The crude material thus obtained was purified by dissolving it in hot 2.5 mHCl and treating with charcoal. Filtration of the hot solution gave a yellow filtrate, which was neutralized to pH 7 with concentrated NH4OH. Removal of some of the water on a rotary evaporator and cooling the residue overnight at 5 °C gave [8-13C]guanine as a yellowish powder. This was converted (18Zou R. Robins M.J. Can. J. Chem. 1987; 65: 1436-1437Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar) into [8-13C]guanosine, which was in turn converted into the required [8-13C]GTP. [8-13C]Guanosine (283 mg; 1 mmol), which had been dried for 24 h over P2O5 under high vacuum, was suspended in trimethyl phosphate (5 ml) under an atmosphere of dry nitrogen contained in a flask fitted with a rubber septum and then cooled in an ice bath (19Yoshikawa M. Kato T. Takenishi T. Tetrahedron Lett. 1967; 50: 5065-5068Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar). Freshly distilled phosphoryl chloride was added from a syringe (0.285 ml; 3 mmol) and the mixture stirred at 0 °C. All solid material dissolved within 1 h. HPLC analysis after 3 h (anion exchange column; phosphate gradient 0.02m KH2PO4 to 0.5 mKH2PO4) showed only one peak due to product and no peak due to unreacted guanosine. To the cold solution was added cold tri-n-butylamine (2 ml; 8.4 mmol), followed immediately by a freshly prepared ice-cold solution of tri-n-butylamine pyrophosphate, prepared from pyrophosphoric acid (1.780 g; 10 mmol) and tri n-butylamine (4.765 ml; 20 mmol) in dimethylformamide (10 ml) (20Ludwig J. Acta Biochim. Biophys. Acad. Sci. Hung. 1981; 16: 131-133PubMed Google Scholar). After 1 min, the reaction mixture was quenched with cold water (200 ml) and the pH adjusted to 9–10 with 1 maqueous potassium hydroxide. The mixture was extracted three times with ether to remove free tributylamine, and all traces of ether were removed from the aqueous layer using a rotary evaporator under vacuum at room temperature. The aqueous solution was loaded onto a column of Dowex-1 anion exchange resin in the chloride form (25 × 110 mm). Distilled water (3.5 liters) was first passed through the column, which was then developed with a sodium chloride gradient (0–0.2m NaCl dissolved in 0.01 m HCl). Monitoring by UV (254 nm) showed three well resolved peaks, the third and largest being the desired GTP, eluted after about 7 liters of the eluting gradient had been passed through. The GTP was separated from the buffer salts by using a toluene-treated charcoal column. The type of charcoal used for this purpose is critical, and some commercial charcoals are not suitable. Riedel de Haën animal charcoal (knochenkohle pulver, catalog number 18008) works satisfactorily. The charcoal column (25 × 85 mm) was prepared in 1 m HCl and then washed with water until the effluent was neutral. It was partially deactivated by washing with a mixture of toluene/0.88 mNH4OH/isopropanol/water (ratio 1:3:50:46), then with a mixture of EtOH/Water/NH4OH (2:2:1), and then with distilled water. The column was stored in water and could be reused repeatedly. The GTP-containing fractions from the Dowex column were loaded onto the charcoal column, which was washed with distilled water (500 ml). Elution with 1 liter of a solution of ethanol/water/0.88m NH4OH (50:45:5), followed by evaporation of the eluate to dryness in a rotary evaporator under vacuum at room temperature, gave a white powder, which was washed with ethanol and diethyl ether and stored at −5 °C. Yield was 129 mg. HPLC analysis of this product showed one main peak corresponding to authentic GTP purchased from Sigma. Its UV spectra measured at pH 2, 7, and 13 were identical with the corresponding UV spectra of authentic GTP.1H, 13C, and 31P NMR spectra were measured in buffer solution containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 100 mm KCl, and 85% D2O and showed the product to be pure GTP, uncontaminated with either guanosine di- or monophosphate, although containing about 15% inorganic triphosphate. The {1H}13C spectrum showed a single enriched peak at δ 137.6 (C-8). The 1H spectrum included a doublet at δ 8.03 (1 J C-H = 216 Hz; H-8) and a quartet at δ 5.82. (3 J H-H = 6, 3 J H-C = 4; H-1′). The {1H}31P spectrum showed signals at δ −18.35 (t, J = 19.8 Hz; guanosine β-P), −7.51 (d,J = 19.5 Hz; guanosine α-P), and −2.40 (d,J = 21.1 Hz; guanosine γ-P), as well as small signals at δ −17.87 (t, J = 20.9 Hz; P-2 of inorganic triphosphate) and −3.03 (d, J = 20.9 Hz; P-1 and P-3 of inorganic triphosphate).

A mixture containing 8.5 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, 7 mm GTP (GDP-free), 85 mmKCl, 2.1 mm EDTA, 4 mm dithiothreitol, and 40 mg of GTP cyclohydrolase I H179A mutant protein in a total volume of 4.7 ml was incubated for 6.5 h at 37 °C. The reaction was terminated by the addition of 1 m HCl to a final pH of 4.7. Precipitate was removed by centrifugation. Ice-cold, doubly distilled water was added to a total volume of 50 ml. The solution was placed on a column of DEAE-cellulose (DE52, Whatman, Maidstone, United Kingdom; 2 × 14.5 cm) that had been equilibrated with 30 mmLiCl, pH 3.5, at 4 °C. The column was washed with 100 ml of 30 mm LiCl, pH 3.5, and was subsequently developed with a linear gradient of 98–195 mm LiCl (total volume, 400 ml). The effluent was monitored photometrically (280 nm). The yield (4.6 μmol, 13.5% based on GTP) was determined photometrically using an absorbance coefficient of ε273 nm, pH 7 = 14,300m−1 cm−1. Fractions were combined, and 0.5 ml of 0.25 mm ammonium bicarbonate was added. The mixture was lyophilized. Dry methanol was added to the residue. The insoluble lithium salt of 2-amino-5-formylamino-6-ribofuranosylamino-4(3H)-pyrimidinone 5′-triphosphate was collected by centrifugation. LiCl was removed by washing with dry methanol. The residue was stored at −70 °C. 2,6-Diamino-5-formylamino-4(3H)-pyrimidinone was prepared according to the published synthesis by Pfleiderer (22Pfleiderer W. Chem.

Escherichia coli strain M15[pREP4] harboring the mutated pECHI expression plasmid was grown in LB medium containing 150 mg of ampicillin and 22 mg of kanamycin per liter as described (11Nar H.

Cells were harvested by centrifugation. Wet cell mass (200 mg) was suspended in 1 ml of 200 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 2.5 mm EDTA, 3 mm sodium azide, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.5 mg of lysozyme. The mixture was incubated for 90 min at 37 °C. Cell lysis was completed by ultrasonic treatment. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation. Crude cell extract was dialyzed against 5 liters of buffer A containing 10 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, 2.5 mm EDTA, and 3 mm sodium azide. The dialysate was applied to a column of DEAE-cellulose (DE52, Whatman; 4 × 11 cm) that had been equilibrated at 4 °C in the same buffer. The column was washed with 300 ml of buffer A and developed with a linear gradient of 10–150 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.0. Fractions containing enzymatic activity (determined as formation of 2-amino5-formylamino-6-ribofuranosylamino-4(3H)-pyrimidinone 5′-triphosphate) were combined and concentrated by ultracentrifugation. The protein was stored at 4 °C. GTP cyclohydrolase I in crude cell extracts was monitored by radial immune diffusion on agarose plates containing 60 μl of polyclonal rabbit antiserum againstE. coli wild-type GTP cyclohydrolase I in 150 μl of 100 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, containing 3 mmsodium azide and 0.56% agarose (DNA-grade). Purified wild-type protein was used as standard (21Bracher A. Eisenreich W. Schramek N. Ritz H. Götze E. Herrmann A. Gütlich M. Bacher A. J. Biol.

One-dimensional and two-dimensional1H and 13C NMR spectra were recorded at 17 °C in D2O using a Bruker DRX500 spectrometer. MLEV17 and GARP sequences were used for decoupling of 1H,13C, and 15N. Experimental setup and data processing were performed according to standard Bruker software (XWINNMR). The hypothetical reaction mechanism of GTP cyclohydrolase I proposed by Brown, Shiota, and their co-workers (12Burg A.W. Brown G.M. J. Biol.

Under appropriate conditions, it appeared possible to convert compounds of this type to highly fluorescent pteridines, thus facilitating their detection with high sensitivity. Our earlier site-directed mutagenesis study (11Nar H. Huber R. Auerbach G. Fischer M. Hösl C. Ritz H. Bracher A. Meining W. Eberhardt S. Bacher A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 12120-12125Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) had afforded a number of GTP cyclohydrolase I mutants (point mutation of residues Cys110, Cys181, Glu152, His112, His113, and His179), which were unable to form detectable amounts of dihydroneopterin triphosphate from GTP. These apparently inactive mutants were incubated with GTP, and the reaction mixtures were then boiled with HCl, neutralized, and incubated with butanedione as described under “Experimental Procedures” (Fig. 2). The mixtures were analyzed by fluorescence-monitored HPLC. A fluorescent compound identified as 6,7-dimethylpterin (compound6, Fig. 2) was observed in assays with cell extracts of recombinant E. coli strains expressing mutant enzymes carrying various amino acids instead of histidine 179, thus suggesting that a diaminopyrimidine-type product had indeed been formed. When the HCl treatment was omitted, little or no 6,7-dimethylpterin was formed in assays with these mutant proteins. This indicates that initially noortho-diaminopyrimidines were present. The rates of product formation detected in these assay mixtures are summarized in TableI. The highest formation rate of the product detected as 6,7-dimethylpterin was observed with the H179S mutant; mutants H179K and H179R did not catalyze any detectable reaction at all. Nevertheless, the specific enzymatic activity for formation of the unknown compound by mutant H179S was only 2.5% as compared with the specific enzymatic activity for the formation of dihydroneopterin triphosphate by wild-type GTP cyclohydrolase I. Mutant H179A was selected for further studies on the basis of preliminary data on 6,7-dimethylpterin formation rate.Table IEnzymatic activity as determined in crude lysates of expression strains for GTP cyclohydrolase I mutantsEnzyme mutationFormation rateCompound2Compound 5nmol mg−1 min−1Wild-typeND236H179A3.7≤0.01H179D0.24≤0.02H179F2.8≤0.07H179K0.11≤0.01H179N2.9≤0.06H179Q4.9≤0.01H179R0.06≤0.01H179S6.3≤0.03L134S1.40.87Q151A9.661Q151END9.9S135A2.410S135C1.81.7S135HND0.20S135WND≤0.04Rates of product formation were obtained by linear regression analysis of product concentrations versus time.

Whereas replacement of residue H179 affords mutant enzymes converting GTP exclusively to the unknown product, the mutant proteins L134S, Q151A, S135A, and S135C formed both the unknown compound and dihydroneopterin triphosphate from GTP (Table I). In order to determine the structure of the putative pyrimidine intermediate produced by mutant H179A, we decided to use stable isotope labeled GTP samples as substrates in order to increase the sensitivity and selectivity of NMR detection. [8-13C]GTP was synthesized and incubated with H179A mutant protein in phosphate buffer at pH 7.0 in an NMR tube. The sample was kept in the NMR magnet at a temperature of 37 °C, and 13C NMR spectra were recorded at intervals (Fig. 3). A signal at 165.4 ppm increased at an approximately linear rate, and a signal at 164.9 was found to increase with apparently sigmoidal kinetics. After incubation at 37 °C for 20 h, two small additional signals were observed at 169.9 and 170.1 ppm. These initial data tentatively suggested the formation of four different formamide-type species from the proffered GTP. Formation of significant amounts of13C-labeled formate was not observed. The putative formamidopyrimidine-type compounds could be separated from remaining substrate GTP by ion exchange chromatography. However, they could not be separated from each other. In order to unequivocally assign the structures of the four compounds formed, we prepared [8,1′,2′,3′,4′,5′-13C6,7-15N]GTP (Fig. 4 A, compound1a) by enzymatic synthesis. The compound was treated with the H179A mutant protein, and the isolated mixture of four reaction products was analyzed by two-dimensional NMR spectroscopy. Fig.5 shows a section from a two-dimensional1H13C HMQC-TOCSY spectrum and the corresponding parts from one-dimensional 1H{13C} and13C{1H} spectra. The one-dimensional13C spectrum shows two pairs of doublets whose intensities differ by a factor of about 10. These signals showed correlations to1H doublet signals located in the range of 7.8 and 8.17 ppm. The chemical shift values of both 13C and1H resonances are in line with the presence of four different formamide-type molecular species. The doublet character of the respective 13C and 1H signals can be attributed to 15N coupling as demonstrated by comparison with a 15N-decoupled spectrum where singlets are observed (not shown). Therefore, all products observed carry the formyl group at the 15N atom attached to position 5 of the pyrimidine ring.Figure 5Section from HMQC-TOCSY spectrum of the product mixture obtained from [8,1′,2′,3′,4′,5′-13C6,7-15N]GTP by the mutant H179A.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Chemical shift arguments suggest that the formamide C-N bond hascis configuration in the pair of major products andtrans configuration in the pairs of minor products (26Breitmaier E.

The assignments are well in line with studies on the pyrimidine base aglycon, 2,6-diamino-5-formylamino-4(3H)-pyrimidinone, which was also shown to display formamide cis/transisomerism. The 1H chemical shifts of the formyl groups in this compound were closely similar to those of the products of GTP cyclohydrolase I mutant H179A (TableIII). The ratio of the cis andtrans species in the equilibrium mixture of 2,6-diamino-5-formylamino-4(3H)-pyrimidinone were also in close similarity with that in the product mixture generated by the H179A mutant enzyme.Table IIINMR data of the compounds discussed under ResultsCompoundPositionChemical shiftaChemical shifts were referenced to external TSP.Coupling constantsIntegrals, 13CCorrelation experiments1H{13C}b1H data refer to {13C} decoupled spectra.13C‖J CC‖‖1 J HC‖‖J HH‖‖1 J CN‖‖2 J HN‖INADEQUATEHMQCTOCSYppmHz1a88.03 (d)137.59 (s)216.3010.91′5.82 (d)86.70 (d)43.3 (2′)1685.8 (2′)2′4.69 (s)73.21 (dd)42.7 (1′), 38.0 (3′)≈150ND3′4.48 (s)70.21 (t)38.1 (2′, 4′)≈150ND4′4.23 (s)83.89 (dt)c3 J CP: 8.9 Hz.40.4 (3′, 5′)≈150ND5′4.14 (m), 4.09 (m)65.10 (dd)d2 J CP: 4.8 Hz.42.6 (4′)≈150ND2a (β,s-cis)-CHO8.16 (d)165.43 (d)199.014.615.71.01′5.60 (d)84.19 (d)45.2 (2′)1656.0 (2′)1.052′2′, 3′2′4.19 (t)72.61 (dd)43.7 (1′), 38.4 (3′)≈1505.7 (1′, 3′)1.21′, 3′1′, 3′3′4.36 (t)69.4–70.4 (m)ND≈1504.2 (2′, 4′)ND2′1′, 2′, 4′4′4.01 (m)81.75 (dt)e3 J CP: 9.3 Hz.40.7 (3′, 5′)≈150ND1.25′3′, 5′5′3.88–3.93 (m)64.70 (d, broad)38.4 (4′)≈150NDND4′4′2b (α,s-cis)-CHO8.17 (d)164.90 (d)199.613.615.90.741′5.84 (d)80.97 (d)43.7 (2′)1684.3 (2′)ND2′2′2′4.23 (t)69.4–70.4 (m)ND≈1504.7 (1′, 3′)ND1′1′, 3′3′4.36 (t)69.4–70.4 (m)ND≈1504.2 (2′, 4′)ND2′, 4′4′4.02 (m)80.42 (t, broad)40.4 (3′, 5′)≈150NDND5′3′, 5′5′3.98–4.05 (m)64.53 (d, broad)39.4 (4′)≈150NDND4′4′2c (β,s-trans)-CHO7.79 (d)170.09 (d)197.214.613.20.081′5.82 (d)86.34 (d)ND4 (2′)ND2d(α,s-trans)-CHO7.75 (d)169.91 (d)197.114.713.00.061′5.58 (d)84.0 (d)ND6 (2′)ND6a(s-cis)-CHO8.17 (s)NDNDNDNDND1.06b (s-trans)-CHO7.80 (s)NDNDNDNDND0.12Spectra were measured in D2O at pH 7.0.

Capsular polysaccharides are the outermost structures on a bacterial cell and play a critical role in the interactions of the cell with the environment (1Roberts I.S. Annu. Rev.

The anabolism of dTDP-l-rhamnose from d-glucose-1-phosphate is catalyzed by four enzymes, namely, d-glucose-1-phosphate thymidylyltransferase, dTDP-d-glucose 4,6-dehydratase, dTDP-4-keto-6-deoxy-d-glucose 3,5-epimerase, and dTDP-4-keto-l-rhamnose reductase (Fig.1) (15Melo A.

Biochem. 1992; 204: 539-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). On the other hand,d-fucose has been identified as a component of other bacterial polysaccharides in only a few publications (19Sato N. Nakazawa F. Sato M. Hoshino E. Ito T. Carbohydr. Res. 1993; 245: 105-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 20Winn A.M. Galbraith L. Temple G.S. Wilkinson S.G. Carbohydr. Res. 1993; 247: 249-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), and there is no report concerning the activated nucleotide sugar form ofd-fucose in the synthesis of dTDP-d-fucose. On the basis of the chemical structure of dTDP-d-fucose, Shibaev (21Shibaev V.N. Adv. Carbohydr. Chem. Biochem. 1986; 44: 277-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) predicted that dTDP-d-fucose synthesis occurs along the same pathway that leads to dTDP-l-rhamnose but that it branches off after the intermediate dTDP-4-keto-6-deoxy-d-glucose, when the intermediate is acted on by a reductase to produce dTDP-d-fucose (Fig. 1). This hypothesis, however, is not supported by independent evidence. Recently, a large gene cluster associated with the biosynthesis of the serotype-specific polysaccharide antigen of serotype b A. actinomycetemcomitans was cloned and characterized by our group (22Yoshida Y. Nakano Y. Yamashita Y. Koga T. Infect. Immun. 1998; 66: 107-114Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It follows from the components of serotype b-specific antigen that some genes coding for enzymes responsible for the synthesis of dTDP-d-fucose may be located in the cloned gene cluster. This is the first report to identify genes coding for essential enzymes involved in the dTDP-d-fucose synthetic pathway and to characterize the purified enzymes. Escherichia coli DH5α (supE44 ΔlacU169 (φ80lacZΔM15) hsdR17 recA1 endA1 gyrA96 thi-1 relA1) (23Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Mannual. 2nd Ed.

Berlyn (E. coliGenetic Stock Center, Department of Biology, Yale University, New Haven, CT), was used as the host strain to express genes inserted into pHSG399 (25Takeshita S. Sato M. Toba M. Masahashi W. Hashimoto-Gotoh T. Gene (Amst.). 1987; 61: 63-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar), pGEM-T vector (Promega, Madison, WI), or pTrc99A (26Amann E. Ochs B. Abel K.J.

E. colistrains were grown aerobically in 2× TY broth at 30 or 37 °C (23Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Mannual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). When required, antibiotics were used to supplement media at the indicated concentrations: ampicillin at 50 μg/ml and chloramphenicol at 20 μg/ml. DNA isolation, restriction endonuclease digestion, ligation, and transformation were performed essentially as described by Sambrook et al. (23Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Mannual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Plasmid pARF400 was constructed from pARF211 containing the region responsible for the synthesis of serotype b-specific polysaccharide antigen (22Yoshida Y. Nakano Y. Yamashita Y. Koga T. Infect. Immun. 1998; 66: 107-114Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A 7.0-kilobaseNheI-BamHI fragment of pARF211 was ligated toXbaI-BamHI-digested pHSG399 (25Takeshita S. Sato M. Toba M. Masahashi W. Hashimoto-Gotoh T. Gene (Amst.). 1987; 61: 63-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar) to produce pARF400. Seven deletion derivatives of pARF400 were constructed by digestion of the plasmid with appropriate restriction enzymes (Fig.2 A). These eight plasmids were used to detect the gene coding for a dTDP-4-keto-6-deoxy-d-glucose reductase. The DNA fragments carrying rmlA, rmlB,rmlC, or rmlD of A. actinomycetemcomitans were amplified by PCR using pARF100 (22Yoshida Y. Nakano Y. Yamashita Y. Koga T. Infect. Immun. 1998; 66: 107-114Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) as a template and the following oligonucleotides as primers: for thermlA gene, 5′-ATGAAGGGTATTATTCTT-3′ and 5′-TTATTTCTCCTCGTTGAT-3′; for the rmlB gene, 5′-ATGTTGAAAACTATTTTA-3′ and 5′-TTATTGACTGCCTAAACG-3′; for thermlC gene, 5′-TTAAAGCGTATGCGGAGT-3′ and 5′-TTAAAATTTTACCGTTTC-3′; and for the rmlD gene, 5′-ATCAACGAGGAGAAATAA-3′ and 5′-TTTACTCCGCATACGCTT-3′. Each PCR product was cloned separately into pGEM-T vector (Promega) to make four plasmids. These plasmids were subsequently digested withNcoI and SalI and subcloned intoNcoI-SalI-digested pTrc99A (26Amann E. Ochs B. Abel K.J. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 69: 301-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (868) Google Scholar) to yield pARF405, pARF401, pARF406, and pARF411. To construct pTYB2 derivatives, the rmlA, rmlB, and fcd genes were amplified by PCR from pARF100 (22Yoshida Y. Nakano Y. Yamashita Y. Koga T. Infect. Immun. 1998; 66: 107-114Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The following sets of primers were used for amplification: for thermlA gene, 5′-ATGCATATGAAGGGTATTATTCTT-3′ and 5′-GGGCCCGGGTTTCTCCTCGTTGATTAA-3′; for the rmlBgene, 5′-ATGCATATGTTGAAAACTATTTTA-3′ and 5′-GGGCCCGGGTTGACTGCCTAAACGCTC-3′; and for thefcd gene, 5′-ATGCATATGATTATCGGAAATGGA-3′ and 5′-GGGCCCGGGTTTAATAGCATAATATTT-3′. These primers were designed so that NdeI and SmaI restriction sites (underlined) were created in the PCR product. Each PCR product was purified using a QIAquick PCR Purification Kit (Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA) and, after double digestion with NdeI and SmaI, directly ligated to an NdeI-SmaI double-digested pTYB2 vector to produce pARF514, pARF509, and pARF517. Crude enzyme extracts were obtained from E. coli SØ874 containing each plasmid (pARF405, pARF401, pARF406, pARF411, pARF400, pARF420, pARF421, pARF422, pARF423, pARF424, pARF425, and pARF426) as described previously (27Tsukioka Y. Yamashita Y. Oho T. Nakano Y. Koga T. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 1126-1134Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The resulting crude enzyme extracts were stored at −20 °C until used. The rmlA,rmlB, and fcd products were purified using the expression vector, pTYB2 (New England Biolabs). To purify thermlA, rmlB, and fcd products, E. coliER2566 was transformed with pARF514, pARF509, and pARF517, respectively. Optimally, cells were grown in 500 ml of 2× TY broth with ampicillin at 30 °C to an optical density of 0.7 at 600 nm. Cultures were induced with 1 mmisopropyl-β-thiogalactopyranoside. The cells were harvested 4 h after induction and lysed by ultrasonication. The cell extracts were obtained by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. Binding to chitin beads (New England Biolabs), cleavage of the fusion protein (in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 200 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 30 mmdithiothreitol at 4 °C in 20 h), and elution of each product was done according to the manufacturer's instructions. The protein fraction was collected, and glycerol was added to a final concentration of 50%. The purified proteins were stored at −20 °C until used. The purity of the proteins was checked by SDS-PAGE. The overall function of the rmlA,rmlB, rmlC, and rmlD products was ascertained by the detection of rhamnose. Moreover, the gene coding for a dTDP-4-keto-6-deoxy-d-glucose reductase was identified by the production of fucose. The reaction mixture (20 μl), containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 12 mm MgCl2, 4 mm α-d-glucose-1-phosphate, 4 mm dTTP, 0.45 unit of inorganic pyrophosphatase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), 6 mm NADPH, and appropriate amounts of the crude enzyme extracts, was incubated at 37 °C for 3 h. The solution was mixed with 180 μl of 0.5 mHCl. After the tube was sealed under vacuum, the mixed solution was heated at 80 °C for 1 h to hydrolyze the reaction products. The assay for the conversion of d-glucose-1-phosphate and dTTP to dTDP-d-glucose, dTDP-4-keto-6-deoxy-d-glucose, or dTDP-d-fucose was performed by reversed-phase HPLC. The incubation mixture (40 μl) contained 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 12 mmMgCl2, 4 mmα-d-glucose-1-phosphate, 4 mm dTTP, 0.9 unit of inorganic pyrophosphatase, 8 mm NADPH, and 2 μg of the purified proteins/ml. Incubations were carried out at 37 °C for 3 h. Sugar components in the hydrolyzed solution were coupled with 2-aminopyridine, and the pyridylamino sugars were analyzed by HPLC with an anion-exchange column (PALPAK type A column; Takara, Kyoto, Japan) as described previously (27Tsukioka Y. Yamashita Y. Oho T. Nakano Y. Koga T. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 1126-1134Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Suzuki J. Kondo A. Kato I. Hase S. Ikenaka T. Agric. Biol. Chem. 1991; 55: 283-284Crossref Scopus (2) Google Scholar). The identification of dTTP, dTDP-d-glucose, dTDP-4-keto-6-deoxy-d-glucose, or dTDP-d-fucose was confirmed using reversed-phase HPLC as described by Tonettiet al. (29Tonetti M. Sturla L. Bisso A. Benatti U. De Flora A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27274-27279Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Samples (10 μl) diluted 10-fold with distilled water were injected onto a TSKgel ODS-80Ts column (0.46 by 15 cm; Tosoh, Tokyo, Japan) with 0.5 mKH2PO4 as the mobile phase at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min at 40 °C. The eluate was monitored with a UV detector at 260 nm. The fractions containing dTDP-d-fucose were collected from the reaction mixture using the HPLC method described above. The reaction mixture (4 ml) contained 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 12 mmMgCl2, 4 mmα-d-glucose-1-phosphate, 4 mm dTTP, 90 units of inorganic pyrophosphatase, 8 mm NADPH, and 2 μg of the purified rmlA, rmlB, and fcd products/ml. To remove the KH2PO4, four volumes of ethanol were added to the solution collected. The mixture was then centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 10 min. After ethanol precipitation, the supernatant (60 ml) was concentrated to approximately 1 ml by evaporation and desalted by gel filtration on a Sephadex G-10 column (1.5 × 69 cm; flow rate 30 ml/h; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) with distilled water as the eluent. The sample was lyophilized and redissolved in 0.5 ml of D2O and transferred to a 5-mm NMR tube. 1H NMR analysis was performed on a Bruker AM400 spectrometer. The measurement was made at 298 K. The chemical shifts were referenced to 3-trimethylsilylproionate-D4 at 0.0 ppm. The 1H spectrum of 128 scans was recorded with presaturation of HOD resonance at 4.72 ppm. dTDP-d-Fucose as a sample was obtained by the same method as described under “NMR Analysis.” About 2 mg of dTDP-d-fucose was dissolved in 300 μl of 0.1m HCl. An ampoule containing the solution was sealed under vacuum and heated at 80 °C for 1 h to hydrolyze dTDP-d-fucose. The solution was then evaporated to remove water and HCl. The pellet, d-fucose, orl-fucose was converted into the correspondingd-(+)-2-octylglycoside acetate by the method of Leonteinet al. (30Leontein K. Lindberg B. Lönngren J. Carbohydr. Res. 1978; 62: 359-362Crossref Scopus (778) Google Scholar). Each product was characterized by gas-liquid chromatography (model GC-14B; Shimadzu Works, Tokyo, Japan) with a fused silica capillary column (CP Sil-88, 0.25 mm by 50 m; Chrompack Inc., Bridgewater, NJ) at 200 °C. Approximately 1 μl of the sample was injected, and the split ratio was 1:20. Helium was used as a carrier gas at a flow rate of 0.9 ml/min. At first, dTDP-4-keto-6-deoxy-d-glucose was synthesized as a substrate and purified. The reaction mixture (20 ml) contained 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 12 mm MgCl2, 4 mm α-d-glucose-1-phosphate, 4 mm dTTP, 450 units of inorganic pyrophosphatase, and 2 μg of the purified rmlA and rmlB products/ml. The dTDP-4-keto-6-deoxy-d-glucose in the reaction mixture was purified by HPLC, ethanol precipitation, and gel filtration as described above. The general approach for determining the kinetic properties of dTDP-4-keto-6-deoxy-d-glucose reductase is as described by Cleland (31Cleland W.W. Boyer P.D. 2nd Ed. The Enzyme. 2. Academic Press, New York1970: 1-65Google Scholar) and Segel (32Segel I.H. Enzyme Kinetics: Behavior and Analysis of Rapid Equilibrium and Steady-state Enzyme Systems. John Wiley & Sons, New York1975: 957Google Scholar). The experiments were designed to provide data by varying the concentration of dTDP-4-keto-6-deoxy-d-glucose at several fixed concentrations of NADPH. The enzyme assay was carried out in a microcuvette containing 0.5 ml of a reaction mixture composed of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 12 mm MgCl2, 80 ng of the purified protein/ml, 18.8–300 μm of dTDP-4-keto-6-deoxy-d-glucose, and 25–150 μmof NADPH. The kinetic constants were determined by the estimating the amount of NADPH oxidation during the conversion of dTDP-4-keto-6-deoxy-d-glucose to dTDP-d-fucose. The rate of the decrease in optical density at 340 nm was determined spectrophotometrically. Previously, we reported cloning and characterizing a large gene cluster associated with the biosynthesis of the serotype-specific polysaccharide antigen of A. actinomycetemcomitans Y4 (serotype b) and that the gene cluster contains 24 ORFs (22Yoshida Y. Nakano Y. Yamashita Y. Koga T. Infect. Immun. 1998; 66: 107-114Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). ORF7, ORF6, ORF9, and ORF8, whose gene products exhibit strong homologies to the rmlA, rmlB, rmlC, andrmlD products, respectively (22Yoshida Y. Nakano Y. Yamashita Y. Koga T. Infect. Immun. 1998; 66: 107-114Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), were subcloned into the expression vector, pTrc99A. The resulting plasmids were introduced intoE. coli SØ874, which is a rough mutant lacking the E. coli rml gene cluster, and the gene products were extracted from the transformants of strain SØ874. dTDP-l-Rhamnose was synthesized from d-glucose-1-phosphate, dTTP, and NADPH only when all four crude enzyme extracts were added to the reaction mixture (data not shown). This result as well as the high homologies of the ORF7, ORF6, ORF9, and ORF8 products to the rmlA, rmlB, rmlC, and rmlD gene products, respectively, suggests that ORF7, ORF6, ORF9, and ORF8 encoded-glucose-1-phosphate thymidylyltransferase, dTDP-d-glucose 4,6-dehydratase, dTDP-4-keto-6-deoxy-d-glucose 3,5-epimerase, and dTDP-4-keto-l-rhamnose reductase, respectively. Therefore, ORF7, ORF6, ORF9, and ORF8 have been renamed rmlA,rmlB, rmlC, and rmlD, respectively. To identify the gene encoding dTDP-4-keto-6-deoxy-d-glucose reductase, eight deletion derivatives of pARF211 (pARF400, pARF420, pARF421, pARF422, pARF423, pARF424, pARF425, and pARF426) (Fig. 2 A) were constructed, and a crude enzyme extract from E. coliSØ874 harboring each plasmid was obtained. Each crude enzyme extract was added to a reaction mixture containingd-glucose-1-phosphate and dTTP as substrates and crude enzyme extracts from E. coli SØ874 expressingrmlA and rmlB as enzymes. Fucose was not detected in the hydrolysate of the reaction mixture containing the crude enzyme extract from E. coli transformant harboring pARF425 by HPLC after being coupled with 2-aminopyridine (Fig. 2 B,top). The HPLC analysis using the crude enzyme extract fromE. coli transformant harboring pARF421, pARF422, or pARF424 instead of pARF425 exhibited a similar pattern (data not shown). On the other hand, pyridylaminated fucose was detected in the hydrolysate of the reaction mixture containing the crude enzyme extract from E. coli transformant harboring pARF400 by HPLC (Fig. 2 B,bottom). A similar HPLC profile was exhibited when using the crude enzyme extract from E. coli transformant harboring pARF420, pARF423, or pARF426 instead of pARF400 (data not shown). To determine relative retention times, pyridylaminated xylose was added to each sample as an internal standard. These results suggested that dTDP-4-keto-6-deoxy-d-glucose reductase is encoded by ORF14. Fucose was not detected in the reaction mixtures lacking one of the crude enzyme extracts from E. coli SØ874 expressingrmlA, rmlB, or ORF14. We therefore renamed ORF14fcd according to the new gene nomenclature of Reeveset al. (33Reeves P.R. Hobbs M. Valvano M.A. Skurnik M. Whitfield C. Coplin D. Kido N. Klena J. Maskell D. Raetz C.R. Rick P.D. Trends Microbiol. 1996; 4: 495-503Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). These results were summarized in Fig.2 A. To unequivocally determine the function of the rmlA, rmlB, andfcd products, these proteins were purified by affinity chromatography as described in detail under “Experimental Procedures.” The proteins were homogeneous as judged by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 3). The molecular masses of the denatured polypeptides determined by SDS-PAGE of 32, 39, and 27 kDa agree well with the predicted molecular masses of the rmlA,rmlB, and fcd gene products, respectively. An in vitro assay was carried out with these purified enzymes. The conversion of d-glucose-1-phosphate and dTTP to dTDP-d-glucose was observed in the reaction catalyzed by the rmlA product (Fig.4 B). dTDP-4-Keto-6-deoxy-d-glucose was detected as a broad peak in the reaction mixture containing the purified products of bothrmlA and rmlB as enzymes (Fig. 4 C). The reason why the peak of this intermediate is apparently broad and poor is unknown. dTDP-d-Fucose was detected in the reaction mixture containing all three purified proteins, the rmlA,rmlB, and fcd products (Fig. 4 D). The retention time of the dTDP-d-glucose formed was compared with that obtained for a commercially available standard. However, a standard for dTDP-4-keto-6-deoxy-d-glucose could not be purchased from any company. Therefore, the standard for dTDP-4-keto-6-deoxy-d-glucose was synthesized using the purified rmlA and rmlB products of E. coli K-12 (34Stevenson G. Neal B. Liu D. Hobbs M. Packer N.H. Batley M. Redmond J.W. Lindquist L. Reeves P. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 4144-4156Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). 1H NMR analysis and gas-liquid chromatography analysis were performed to confirm the structure and configuration of this final product. NADPH was not detected under the HPLC condition used. Approximately 2 mg of sugar nucleotide were pooled from several HPLC runs on an ODS-80Ts (Fig. 4 E). After removing the excess phosphate by adding ethanol, the solution was concentrated by evaporation and further purified with a Sephadex G-10 column equilibrated with demineralized water. The fractions containing sugar nucleotide were pooled, lyophilized, and dissolved in D2O. The NMR spectra ofd-fucose, dTDP, and this sample are shown in Fig.5. The signals of d-fucose are rather complicated because of α and β anomers coexisting (Fig.5 A). Each peak is assigned to α6 (1.24 ppm), β6 (1.28 ppm), β2 (3.46 ppm), β3 (3.66 ppm), β4 (3.77 ppm), α2 (3.79 ppm), α4 (3.83 ppm), β5 (3.83 ppm), α3 (3.89 ppm), α5 (4.22 ppm), β1 (4.58 ppm), and α1 (5.21 ppm) from the analogy tol-fucose (35Kotowycz G. Lemieux R.U. Chem. Rev. 1973; 73: 669-698Crossref Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Comparing those peaks with the sample spectrum (Fig. 5 C) and considering the splitting patterns, the peaks from d-fucose in Fig. 5 C are assigned as follows; α6 (1.24 ppm, doublet), α2 (3.77 ppm, double doublet), α4 (3.85 ppm, double doublet), α3 (3.94 ppm, double doublet), α5 (4.31 ppm, quartet), and α1 (5.59 ppm, broad). From the observed coupling constants (J (1,2) = 2.44 Hz,J (2,3) = 10.76 Hz, J (3,4)= 2.96 Hz, J (4,5) = 2.96 Hz), the orientations of H1, H2, H3, H4, and H5 are equatorial, axial, axial, equatorial, and axial, respectively. Thus the integrity of α-d-fucose structure in the current product was confirmed. The broadening and large downfield shift (0.4 ppm) of the H1 band can be attributed to neighboring phosphate groups, which also affects the H2 band, thereby causing the poor resolution. Comparing with dTDP (Fig. 5 B), other peaks are assigned to protons on the nucleotide moiety as follows: CH3 (1.95 ppm, singlet), H6 (7.77 ppm, singlet), H1′ (6.37 ppm, triplet), H2′ (2.38 ppm, double doublet), H3′ + H5′ (4.19 ppm, overlapped), and H4′ (4.65 ppm, multiplet). The signal of H4′ is rather small, perhaps because it is affected by decoupling of water nearby. On the basis of the structure and configuration of dTDP-4-keto-6-deoxy-d-glucose, we can predict that the absolute configuration of the fucosyl residue in dTDP-fucose is d. However, the prediction was not supported by direct evidence. Gas-liquid chromatography analysis was performed to prove the hypothesis. After dTDP-fucose was hydrolyzed, fucosyl residue in dTDP-fucose was detected as a d-(+)-2-octylglycoside acetate. For this fucosyl residue, four peaks were obtained, the two pyranosides and the two furanosides. Relative retention times of four peaks obtained from fucosyl residue in dTDP-fucose agreed with those obtained not from l-fucose but from d-fucose (Fig. 6). Thus the d absolute configuration of the fucose in dTDP-fucose was determined. dTDP-4-Keto-6-deoxy-d-glucose was synthesized and purified as a substrate. The concentration of dTDP-4-keto-6-deoxy-d-glucose was calculated from the absorbance at 320 nm in 0.1 m NaOH assuming a molar absorption coefficient of 5,600m−1·cm−1 (18Marumo K. Lindqvist L. Verma N. Weintraub A. Reeves P.R. Lindberg A.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 204: 539-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Double reciprocal plots of the initial velocity as a function either of dTDP-4-keto-6-deoxy-d-glucose concentration at different NADPH concentrations or of NADPH concentration at different dTDP-4-keto-6-deoxy-d-glucose concentrations yielded apparently nonparallel lines (Fig.7 A). This pattern indicates a sequential mechanism. From the secondary plots (Fig. 7, Band C), the K m values for dTDP-4-keto-6-deoxy-d-glucose and NADPH and theV max value (turnover number) were estimated to be 97.3 μm, 28.7 μm, and 7.74 μm·min−1, respectively. Because the concentration of the enzyme added to the reaction mixture was 2.97 nm, the K cat value was estimated to be 2.61 × 103 min−1. Previously, we identified a gene cluster associated with the biosynthesis of the serotype-specific polysaccharide antigen consisting of l-rhamnose and d-fucose from A. actinomycetemcomitans Y4 (serotype b) (22Yoshida Y. Nakano Y. Yamashita Y. Koga T. Infect. Immun. 1998; 66: 107-114Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). d-Fucose is a component of some bacterial polysaccharides (19Sato N. Nakazawa F. Sato M. Hoshino E. Ito T. Carbohydr. Res. 1993; 245: 105-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 20Winn A.M. Galbraith L. Temple G.S. Wilkinson S.G. Carbohydr. Res. 1993; 247: 249-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). This sugar, however, is not widespread in nature. The biosynthetic precursor ofd-fucose is believed to be dTDP-d-fucose, but little attempt has been made to isolate the enzymes involved in the conversion of d-glucose-1-phosphate and dTTP to dTDP-d-fucose or the genes coding for the enzymes. On the other hand, the synthesis of dTDP-l-rhamnose has been investigated extensively (15Melo A. Elliott W.H. Glaser L. J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 243: 1467-1474Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Melo A. Glaser L. J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 243: 1475-1478Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Lindqvist L. Kaiser R.

Biochem. 1992; 204: 539-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The dTDP-l-rhamnose synthetic pathway consists of four enzymes catalyzing the reaction sequence from d-glucose-1-phosphate and dTTP to dTDP-l-rhamnose through three intermediates, and thermlA, rmlB, rmlC, and rmlDgenes coding for the four enzymes have been identified (24Rajakumar K. Jost B.H. Sasakawa C. Okada N. Yoshikawa M. Adler B. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 2362-2373Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 34Stevenson G. Neal B. Liu D. Hobbs M. Packer N.H. Batley M. Redmond J.W.

Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 7786-7792Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). In this paper, we identified the genes required for the synthesis of dTDP-d-fucose and dTDP-l-rhamnose and showed that dTDP-d-fucose was formed by the reduction of dTDP-4-keto-6-deoxy-d-glucose, an intermediate in the dTDP-l-rhamnose biosynthetic pathway, at C-4 (Fig. 1). We initially identified the four genes required for the synthesis of dTDP-l-rhamnose in A. actinomycetemcomitans. As expected from the amino acid sequences of their products, ORF7, ORF6, ORF9, and ORF8 were suggested to encoded-glucose-1-phosphate thymidylyltransferase, dTDP-d-glucose 4,6-dehydratase, dTDP-4-keto-6-deoxy-d-glucose 3,5-epimerase, and dTDP-4-keto-l-rhamnose reductase, respectively. On the other hand, the identity of dTDP-4-keto-6-deoxy-d-glucose reductase, which forms dTDP-d-fucose, was not predicted from amino acid sequence homology. Instead, the dTDP-d-fucose synthesis gene was located by detecting fucose coupled with 2-aminopyridine in the reaction mixture containing crude extracts from E. coli strains harboringrmlA, rmlB, and one of the eight deletion plasmids (Fig. 2). This experiment led us to conclude that the ORF14 gene encodes a dTDP-4-keto-6-deoxy-d-glucose reductase. We renamed ORF14 the fcd gene. The amino acid sequence deduced from the fcd gene showed an identity of <10% with previously reported proteins in a homology search using the program FASTA. However, a BLAST search showed that the amino acid sequence of the fcd gene product shared limited homology with that of CDP-abequose synthase of Salmonella enterica LT2 (39Verma N. Reeves P. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 5694-5701Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). CDP-Abequose synthase catalyzes a similar reaction, in which the keto group on carbon 4 of a hexosyl group is attacked. The difference between the two reductases lies in their substrates. dTDP-4-Keto-6-deoxy-d-glucose is converted to thel-manno configuration by dTDP-4-keto-6-deoxy-d-glucose 3,5-epimerase and is then reduced by dTDP-4-keto-l-rhamnose reductase, thermlD product, to form dTDP-l-rhamnose (Fig. 1). The fcd product did not share homology either with the amino acid sequence of the rmlD product or with those of any previously reported NDP-6-deoxyhexosyl-4-ulose reductases except CDP-abequose synthase of S. enterica. An NADPH binding motif GXGXXA (40Scrutton N.S. Berry A. Perham R.N. Nature. 1990; 343: 38-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar) was found in the N-terminal region in the fcd product but not in the corresponding region of CDP-abequose synthase. HPLC analysis of dTDP-d-fucose formed by the purified enzymes showed that d-glucose-1-phosphate was converted to dTDP-d-glucose by the rmlA product, and this was then converted into dTDP-4-keto-6-deoxy-d-glucose by thermlB product. These reactions are common to the first two steps of the dTDP-l-rhamnose biosynthetic pathway (Fig. 1). The retention times of the sugar nucleotide formed by thermlA product and that of its derivative converted by thermlB product agreed with those of dTDP-d-glucose formed by purified glucose-1-phosphate thymidylyltransferase fromE. coli DH5α and dTDP-4-keto-6-deoxy-d-glucose formed by E. coli dTDP-d-glucose 4,6-dehydratase, respectively (data not shown). In addition, dTDP-4-keto-6-deoxy-d-glucose formed by E. coliglucose-1-phosphate thymidylyltransferase and dTDP-d-glucose 4,6-dehydratase was converted to a sugar nucleotide that was eluted at the same retention time as that of dTDP-d-fucose produced by the three A. actinomycetemcomitans enzymes. These results also support the prediction that the rmlA and rmlB products ofA. actinomycetemcomitans Y4 are glucose-1-phosphate thymidylyltransferase and dTDP-d-glucose 4,6-dehydratase, respectively, and that the fcd product reduces dTDP-4-keto-6-deoxy-d-glucose to form dTDP-d-fucose. dTDP-4-Keto-6-deoxy-d-glucose reductase catalyzes a bimolecular group reduction reaction. The mechanisms of such reactions are divided into two major categories, namely, the sequential and ping-pong mechanisms, based on the order of interaction between the enzyme and its substrates (31Cleland W.W. Boyer P.D. 2nd Ed. The Enzyme. 2. Academic Press, New York1970: 1-65Google Scholar, 32Segel I.H. Enzyme Kinetics: Behavior and Analysis of Rapid Equilibrium and Steady-state Enzyme Systems. John Wiley & Sons, New York1975: 957Google Scholar). In contrast to the ping-pong mechanism, in the sequential mechanism all the substrates must combine to form a ternary complex before the product is formed. Our kinetic studies of NADPH and dTDP-4-keto-6-deoxy-d-glucose are consistent with its action by a sequential mechanism (Fig.7 A). The K m andV max values cannot be compared with those of other similar enzymes because no other NDP-6-deoxyhexosyl-4-ulose reductases have been characterized. It is very interesting to note that the primary structure of dTDP-4-keto-6-deoxy-d-glucose reductase from A. actinomycetemcomitans Y4 exhibits little homology with other NDP-6-deoxyhexosyl-4-ulose reductases when considering its origin and evolution. There are only a few reports on d-fucose as a component of bacterial polysaccharide. Furthermore, of the five serotype antigens (a–e) of A. actinomycetemcomitansstrains, only the serotype b antigen contains d-fucose. Moreover, Southern blot analysis indicated that the fcd gene is specific to serotype b (data not shown). It is, however, unlikely that this gene evolved in A. actinomycetemcomitans Y4. The G+C content (37.7%) of the operon essential for producing serotype-specific antigen is lower than the average G+C content (45.6%) of A. actinomycetemcomitans Y4 chromosomal DNA (22Yoshida Y. Nakano Y. Yamashita Y. Koga T. Infect. Immun. 1998; 66: 107-114Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This low G+C content suggests that the gene cluster was transferred from another species. A lower G+C content has been found in many gene clusters involved in the synthesis of various bacterial polysaccharides (34Stevenson G. Neal B. Liu D. Hobbs M. Packer N.H. Batley M. Redmond J.W. Lindquist L. Reeves P. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 4144-4156Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar, 37Jiang X.M. Neal B. Santiago F. Lee S.J. Romana L.K. Reeves P.R. Mol. Microbiol. 1991; 5: 695-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar, 41Arakawa Y. Wacharotayankun R. Nagatsuka T. Ito H. Kato N. Ohta M. J.

In particular, the region containing ORF14-ORF19 has the lowest G+C content (27.0%), and the discrepancy of the G+C content within the gene cluster suggests that thefcd and dTDP-l-rhamnose synthetic genes have different origins. In addition, the amino acid sequences of the proteins encoded by genes around the fcd gene are not homologous with any reported proteins. These findings suggest that thefcd gene evolved in an unknown gene cluster involved in polysaccharide synthesis in some other bacteria and was transferred toA. actinomycetemcomitans. 6-Deoxy-d-talose, a component of serotype a-specific antigen, and 6-deoxy-l-talose, a component of serotype c-specific antigen, are also rare 6-deoxyhexoses (43Shibuya N. Amano K. Azuma J. Nishihara T. Kitamura Y. Noguchi T. Koga T. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16318-16323Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The physiological significance of the rarity of 6-deoxyhexoses in the serotype-specific antigens of A. actinomycetemcomitansremains to be elucidated."
https://openalex.org/W1985305167,"The redox components of the cytochromebc 1 complex from the acidophilic chemolithotrophic organism Thiobacillus ferrooxidans were investigated by potentiometric and spectroscopic techniques. Optical redox titrations demonstrated the presence of two b-type hemes with differing redox midpoint potentials at pH 7.4 (−169 and + 20 mV for bL and bH, respectively). At pH 3.5, by contrast, both hemes appeared to titrate at about +20 mV. Antimycin A, 2-heptyl-4-hydroxyquinolineN-oxide, and stigmatellin induced distinguishable shifts of the b hemes' α-bands, providing evidence for the binding of antimycin A and 2-heptyl-4-hydroxyquinoline N-oxide near heme bH (located on the cytosolic side of the membrane) and of stigmatellin near heme bL (located on the periplasmic side of the membrane). The inhibitors stigmatellin, 5-(n-undecyl)-6-hydroxy-4,7-dioxobenzothiazole, and 2,5-dibromo-3-methyl-6-isopropyl-p-benzoquinone affected the EPR spectrum of the Rieske iron-sulfur center in a way that differs from what has been observed for cytochrome bc 1or b 6 f complexes. The results obtained demonstrate that the T. ferrooxidans complex, although showing most of the features characteristic forbc 1 complexes, contains unique properties that are most probably related to the chemolithotrophicity and/or acidophilicity of its parent organism.

Thiobacillus ferrooxidans is the main bacterium used in the industrial extraction of copper and uranium from ores, using the microbial leaching technique (1Ewart D.K. Hugues N.H. Adv. Inorg. Chem. 1991; 36: 103-135Crossref Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The sole energy-producing process used by this obligate chemolithotrophic bacterium for growth and cell maintenance involves the oxidation of reduced sulfur compounds and/or ferrous ion under acidic conditions, using O2 as the oxidant (2Shafia F. Wilkinson Jr., R.F. J. Bacteriol. 1969; 97: 256-260Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Kelly D.P. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1971; 25: 177-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 4Peck H.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1968; 22: 489-518Google Scholar). When grown on Fe2+, a comparatively small amount of energy is released by the oxidative reaction. The bacterium nevertheless fixes its own CO2, and Fe2+ oxidation must therefore be coupled to reduction of the NAD(P) required for this fixation and other anabolic processes. It has been suggested that an uphill electron transfer, established at the expense of the energy derived from the oxidation of Fe2+ by oxygen, may be involved in the reduction of NAD(P)+ from Fe2+ (for a review, see Ref. 5Ingledew W.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1982; 683: 89-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). Various respiratory chain components have been detected in T. ferrooxidans. The optical spectra measured at 77 K on whole cells indicated the presence of multiple cytochromes c, one cytochrome b, and cytochrome oxidase (6Thikhonova G.B. Lisenkhova L.L. Doman N.G. Skulachev V.P. Biokhimiya. 1967; 32: 725-733PubMed Google Scholar). Using optical and EPR techniques combined with potentiometric and kinetic studies, Ingledew and Cobley (7Ingledew W.J. Cobley J.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1980; 590: 141-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) have detected an a 1-type cytochrome, multiple cytochromes c, cytochrome b, two copper-containing centers, high and low spin ferric hemes, and a ferredoxin center. In these experiments, only the γ-band of cytochrome b was detected at pH 3.2. The presence of ubiquinone-8 has also been reported (8Short A.S. White D.C. Aleem M.I.H. J.

The electron transfer chain from Fe2+ to O2 is presently considered to involve a Fe2+-cytochromec oxidoreductase, rusticyanin, at least one cytochromec (the 14-kDa soluble cytochrome c and/or thec 4-type cytochrome), and ana 1-type cytochrome. Ingledew (5Ingledew W.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1982; 683: 89-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar) has put forward the idea that the uphill electron transfer from Fe2+ to NAD+ may involve a putative bc 1complex, according to a chemiosmotic mechanism, possibly via a Q-cycle mechanism operating in reverse. This mechanism requires the presence of two separate and independent quinone reaction sites: the ubiquinol oxidation site (Qpsite) 1The abbreviations used are: Qp and Qn sites, quinone-binding sites in cytochromebc-type complexes located close to the positive and negative sides of the membrane, respectively; DBMIB, 2,5-dibromo-3-methyl-6-isopropyl-p-benzoquinone; UHDBT, 5-(n-undecyl)-6-hydroxy-4,7-dioxobenzothiazole; HQNO, 2-heptyl-4-hydroxyquinoline N-oxide; E m, redox midpoint potential located on the positive side of the membrane and the ubiquinone reduction site (Qn site) located on the negative side of the membrane (20Mitchell P. J. Theor. Biol. 1976; 62: 327-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (927) Google Scholar, 21Trumpower B.L. Microbiol. Rev. 1990; 54: 101-129Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Brandt U. Trumpower B.L. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1994; 29: 165-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). The Qp site is formed by cytochrome b(in the vicinity of heme bL) and the iron-sulfur protein and is the target of specific inhibitors like myxothiazol, stigmatellin, DBMIB, and UHDBT (for a review, see Ref. 23Link T.A. Haase U. Brandt U. von Jagow G. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1993; 25: 221-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The binding of myxothiazol and stigmatellin results in an alteration of the absorbance spectrum of heme bL of cytochrome b, which is shifted toward the red. The binding of stigmatellin, DBMIB, and UHDBT furthermore induces spectral changes in the EPR spectrum of the Rieske cluster. The Qn site is associated with cytochrome b (in the vicinity of heme bH) and is the target of other specific inhibitors like antimycin A, funiculosin, HQNO, and diuron. The binding of these Qn site inhibitors to the bc complexes induces a red or a blue (in the case of funiculosin) shift in the absorbance spectrum of heme bH. These shift properties have been used to measure the binding of the inhibitors to their specific sites in the bc complexes (24Brandt U. Schägger H. von Jagow G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 173: 499-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). We have recently provided evidence for the presence of abc 1 complex in T. ferrooxidans based on the observation of the typical EPR spectrum of the Rieske center, which is one of the crucial redox centers ofbc 1-type complexes (25Elbehti A. Asso B. Guigliarelli B. Lemesle-Meunier D. International Biohydrometallurgy Symposium, Biomine. The Australian Mineral Foundation, 1997: PB2.1-PB2.10Google Scholar). This was the first and so far only evidence for the existence of a bc 1complex in an acidophilic proteobacterium. In the present study, we characterized the redox centers of the enzyme and the effect of the binding of the specific bc 1 complex inhibitors on cytochrome b and the Rieske iron-sulfur protein in more detail. T. ferrooxidans was kindly supplied by Dr. D. Morin (Bureau des Recherches Géologiques et Minières (BRGM), Orléans, France). The strain was isolated from drainage water at the Salsigne sulfur mine (France). Large-scale growth of the organism was performed at pH 1.6 in the 9 K medium described by Silverman and Lundgren (26Silverman M.P. Lundgren D.G. J. Bacteriol. 1959; 77: 642-647Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), supplemented with 1.6 mmCuSO4·5H2O, using a homemade polypropylene fermentor with a capacity of 400 liters. Cells were harvested according to Bodo and Lundgren (27Bodo C. Lundgren D.G. Can. J. Microbiol. 1974; 20: 1647-1652Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) and stored as pellets at −70 °C. About 12 g of cells (wet weight) were obtained from 300 liters of cell culture. Membrane fragments were prepared as described by Elbehti and Lemesle-Meunier (19Elbehti A. Lemesle-Meunier D. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1996; 136: 51-56Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For the preparation of spheroplasts, cell paste (5 g, wet weight) was washed three times in 0.5 m NaCl at 0 °C and resuspended in 20% (w/v) glucose. The cell suspension was incubated at 37 °C in a shaking water bath for 2 h. The cells were centrifuged at 6000 × g for 10 min and washed three times in 30 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8). After each washing step, one freezing (in liquid nitrogen) and thawing (room temperature) step was performed. The cells were then resuspended in 30 mmTris-HCl (pH 8), 10 mm EDTA, and 20% glucose and incubated for 20 h at 37 °C in the presence of lysozyme (1 mg/ml). After being centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 15 min, the spheroplasts obtained were washed twice in 20 mmβ-alanine/H2SO4 buffer (pH 3.5) and 20% glucose and finally resuspended in the same buffer. The Gram coloration method was used to verify formation of spheroplasts (28Brown R.C. Hopps H.C. Am. J. Clin. Pathol. 1973; 60: 234-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were measured using the method of Lowry et al. (29Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The visible and UV absorption spectra were determined with an Aminco DW2 recording spectrophotometer using 1-cm light path cuvettes. The heme content was determined from the reduced-minus-oxidized difference spectrum using the following millimolar extinction coefficients for the α-peak: Δε550–540 nm = 16.5 mm−1cm−1 (cytochrome c), Δε552–575 nm = 24 mm−1cm−1 (cytochrome b), and Δε603–630 nm = 21 mm−1cm−1 (cytochrome oxidase). The spectral shift of the b hemes was measured as the spectral difference between the dithionite-reduced enzyme in the presence and absence of saturating amounts of inhibitor. Spheroplasts were first reduced by adding a few grains of sodium dithionite, and the base line was recorded. Inhibitor was then added to the sample cuvette, and the same volume of solvent was added to the reference cuvette. The spectra were recorded at 25 °C in either 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) or 20 mmβ-alanine/H2SO4 buffer (pH 3.5), with each buffer containing 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 0.1 mm ε-aminocaproic acid. EPR spectra were recorded at liquid helium temperature on a Bruker ESP 300e X-band spectrometer equipped with an Oxford Instruments liquid helium cryostat and temperature control system. For redox potentiometry, optical titrations were carried out at 25 °C as described by Dutton (30Dutton P.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1971; 226: 63-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar), using a Kontron Uvikon 922 double-beam spectrophotometer equipped with a Spectralon integrating sphere. Membrane fragments were suspended in the same buffers (pH 7.4 and 3.5) as mentioned above; pH values were controlled at the beginning and end of each redox titration. The following redox mediators were used: 1,1′-ferrocenedicarboxylic acid, ferrocenemonocarboxylic acid, 1,4-benzoquinone,N,N,N′,N′-tetramethyl-p-phenylenediamine, 2,5-dimethyl-p-benzoquinone, 1,2-naphthoquinone, 1,4-naphthoquinone, phenazine ethosulfate, indigo carmine, anthraquinone-2,6-disulfonate, and anthraquinone-2-sulfonate. Reductive titrations were carried out using sodium dithionite, and oxidative titrations were done using sodium hexachloroiridate (Na2Cl6Ir). Membrane fractions prepared from the BRGM strain ofT. ferrooxidans were examined for their content of the various cytochromes at pH 7.4. The optical difference spectra shown in Fig. 1 demonstrate the presence of cytochrome a (597 nm), cytochrome(s) c (552 nm), and cytochrome b (560 nm). It can be seen that b-type hemes are substoichiometric to c-type hemes and can only be discerned as a shoulder on the red flank of the c-type hemes' α-peak in the full redox difference spectrum. Fig. 2 shows the results of a redox titration of b-type (at 562 nm; circles) and c-type (at 550 nm; diamonds) hemes carried out on membrane preparations at pH 7.4 (closed symbols) and 3.5 (open symbols). In the case of cytochrome b and at pH 7.4, the data could be fitted with two components with midpoint potentials of −169 and 22 mV, each contributing approximately equally to the total absorbance. These would correspond to cytochrome bL (−170 mV) and bH (20 mV) and imply a ratio of ∼1:1 assuming similar extinction coefficients. At pH 3.5, by contrast, a good fit could already be obtained using only a single n = 1 component with a midpoint potential of 20 mV. These results suggest that the two cytochrome b hemes exhibit rather close redox midpoint potentials at pH 3.5. The data points for the c-type hemes were fitted with four n = 1 components with midpoint potentials of 150, 360, 410, and 485 mV at pH 7.4 and 240, 350, 430, and 560 mV at pH 3.5. Fig. 2 (inset) shows differences in spectra recorded during the titration (at pH 7.4) representing the low (−238 mV minus −127 mV; spectrum A) and high (−127 mV minus +103 mV;spectrum B) potential components of cytochrome bas well as the full redox difference attained during the titration (spectrum C). A slight shift toward shorter wavelengths was observed on going from the low to the high potential spectra of cytochrome b (see below) The typical inhibitors of the bc 1complexes (antimycin A, HQNO, myxothiazol, and stigmatellin) have been found to inhibit a proton-motive force-dependent uphill electron transfer from reduced cytochrome c to NAD+ in spheroplasts from T. ferrooxidans. 2A. Elbehti and D. Lemesle-Meunier, manuscript in preparation. The study of inhibitor-induced changes in spectral properties of the redox site allows the detection of binding of the respective inhibitors and the identification of the affected heme center by its characteristic absorption maximum (24Brandt U. Schägger H. von Jagow G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 173: 499-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 31Kamenski Y.A. Konstantinov A.A. Kunz W.S. Surkov S.A. Biological Membranes. 2. Harwood Academic Publisher GmbH and OPA, Ltd., Amsterdam1985: 100-119Google Scholar). Typically, difference spectra between dithionite-reduced bc 1-containing samples in the presence and absence of inhibitor yield symmetrical S-shaped curves crossing the base line at a wavelength corresponding to the maximum of the absorption band of the heme affected by the inhibitor binding (31Kamenski Y.A. Konstantinov A.A. Kunz W.S. Surkov S.A. Biological Membranes. 2. Harwood Academic Publisher GmbH and OPA, Ltd., Amsterdam1985: 100-119Google Scholar, 32von Jagow G. Engel W.D.

Biochem. 1988; 176: 385-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Binding experiments were performed at acidic and neutral pH values (3.5 and 7.4, respectively) on Thiobacillus spheroplast preparations reduced by an excess of dithionite. Spheroplasts are closed vesicles, and the internal pH is always constant (almost neutral around pH 6.5) whatever the external pH (36Cox J.C. Nicholls D.G. Ingledew W.J. Biochem. J. 1979; 178: 195-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Fig.3 (A and B) shows the effect of antimycin A, HQNO, and stigmatellin on the optical spectra of cytochrome b recorded at pH 7.4 and 3.5, respectively. At pH 7.4, the S-shaped symmetrical curves obtained upon adding antimycin A and HQNO crossed the base line at ∼562 nm, showing a maximum at 566 nm and a minimum at 559 nm (Fig. 3 A). This shape reflects a shift of a heme α-band with a maximum at ∼562 nm toward longer wavelengths (bathochromic effect). These features are consistent with the results of experiments carried out on the purified mitochondrial bc 1 complex and on submitochondrial particles of various origins regarding the red shift of the heme 562 nm absorption band induced by these inhibitors (31Kamenski Y.A. Konstantinov A.A. Kunz W.S. Surkov S.A. Biological Membranes. 2. Harwood Academic Publisher GmbH and OPA, Ltd., Amsterdam1985: 100-119Google Scholar, 32von Jagow G. Engel W.D.

Biochimie (Paris). 1989; 71: 1145-1155Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar). At pH 3.5, the S-shaped curves induced upon adding antimycin A and HQNO also crossed the base line at ∼562 nm, but the curves were less symmetrical than those obtained at pH 7.4, with minima at 553 and 552 nm for antimycin and HQNO, respectively, and maxima at 566 nm for both these inhibitors (Fig. 3 B). At pH 3.5, the difference spectra obtained after adding stigmatellin to reduced spheroplasts exhibited a symmetrical S-shape crossing the base line at 564–565 nm, with a maximum at 569 nm and a minimum at 557 nm (Fig. 3 B). Similar to what has been observed concerning the action of this inhibitor on submitochondrial particles orbc 1 complex isolated from beef heart mitochondria (34von Jagow G. Ohnishi T. FEBS Lett. 1985; 185: 311-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 35Ohnishi T. Brandt U. von Jagow G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 176: 385-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), the red shift induced by stigmatellin therefore has a maximum and a minimum at higher wavelengths than those induced by antimycin and HQNO. This indicates that the heme affected by the binding of stigmatellin has an α-band with a maximum at a higher wavelength than the heme reacting to antimycin and HQNO,i.e. at ∼564–565 nm. At pH 7.4, only a very minor shift was observed in the presence of stigmatellin. The demonstration of the presence of two spectrally different hemes corroborates the slight shift observed during titration. The hemes sensitive to HQNO and antimycin A on one side and stigmatellin on the other side correspond to the high and low potential hemes, respectively. The EPR spectra of membrane preparations from T. ferrooxidans, reduced by ascorbate at pH 7.4 or pH 3.5, are shown in Fig. 4. The g value of the derivative-shaped gy signal (gy = 1.90) and the fact that this center was reduced by a weakly reducing agent such as ascorbate are characteristic for the so-called Rieske center, representing one of the four redox centers of the bccomplexes (21Trumpower B.L. Microbiol. Rev. 1990; 54: 101-129Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A gx signal is observed at g = 1.74 in the spectra at pH 7.4 (Fig. 4, spectrum A); lowering the pH to 3.5 resulted in broadening of this signal and a slight shift toward lower magnetic fields (spectrum A′). It has been shown previously that the shape of the EPR signal is affected by the redox state of the quinone pool in beef heart submitochondrial particles (39de Vries S. Albracht S.P.J. Leeuwerik F.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1979; 546: 316-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) and in chromatophores from Rhodobacter sphaeroides (40Matsuura K. Bowyer J.R. Ohnishi T. Dutton P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 1571-1579Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In both cases, a significant sharpening of the gx trough was seen to occur upon oxidation of the quinone pool. Fig. 4 suggests that, at acidic pH values, the quinone pool in T. ferrooxidansmembranes was at least partially reduced by the added ascorbate, whereas it remained oxidized at pH 7.4. This is in line with the fact that the E m value of ubiquinone increased by 230 mV on going from pH 7.4 to pH 3.5, yielding a theoreticalE m,3.5 value of ∼300 mV. When the inhibitors stigmatellin, UHDBT, and DBMIB (known to bind at the Qp site in close vicinity of the Rieske center) were added, the shape and intensity of the Rieske EPR signals were altered, in particular the gx signal (Fig. 4). At pH 7.4, DBMIB (spectrum B) and UHDBT (spectrum D) shifted the gx signal to slightly lower fields. Addition of stigmatellin resulted in a distinct sharpening of the gx trough and of the gy line (spectrum C). At pH 3.5, the gx trough, which was rather broad in the absence of inhibitor (spectrum A′), was sharpened upon addition of all examined inhibitors (spectra B′–D′). The inhibitor-induced spectra at pH 3.5 appeared to be rather similar to those observed at pH 7.4. The uphill electron transfer between Fe2+ and NAD+, required to allow CO2 fixation via the Calvin cycle, has only been scanty studied so far. The only information on the compounds that may function in this respiratory chain was obtained by Ingledew and Cobley (7Ingledew W.J. Cobley J.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1980; 590: 141-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). In particular, these authors have performed redox titrations of the cytochromes in membrane preparations; clear results, however, were obtained only for cytochromea 1. With respect to c-type hemes, their results indicated the presence of more than one species, but no clear inflection points were obtained. While titrating an a-type cytochrome at 440–479 nm, they found evidence for the presence of two additional components at pH 3.2 with E m values of 280 and 150 mV, which they attributed to b-type hemes. No clear results were obtained from measurements carried out at pH 7.4 for theb- and c-type cytochromes. Electron paramagnetic resonance spectra of the electron transport particles revealed the presence of two copper-containing centers, high and low spin ferric hemes, and a ferredoxin center. The presence of a Rieske protein has not been detected in these studies. We have recently shown that ferrous ion-grown cells from T. ferrooxidans contain a bc 1-type complex (25Elbehti A. Asso B. Guigliarelli B. Lemesle-Meunier D. International Biohydrometallurgy Symposium, Biomine. The Australian Mineral Foundation, 1997: PB2.1-PB2.10Google Scholar) functioning in reverse mode,2 as postulated by Ingledew (5Ingledew W.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1982; 683: 89-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). The present study reports on the characteristics of thisbc 1 complex, allowing us to speculate about a possible reverse electron transfer mechanism. The global absorption band at 551–552 nm obtained from membrane preparations arises from three different c-type cytochromes with apparent molecular masses of 46, 30, and 21 kDa (19Elbehti A. Lemesle-Meunier D. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1996; 136: 51-56Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The EPR spectrum of the 21-kDa cytochromec was characteristic of a dihemicc 4-type cytochrome, and its terminal sequence was found to be identical to that of the soluble cytochromec 4 present in the same strain of T. ferrooxidans (10Cavazza C. Giudici-Orticoni M.-T. Nitschke W. Appia C. Bonnefoy V. Bruschi M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 242: 308-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). 3D. Lemesle-Meunier and P. Tron, unpublished results. It is well known from studies on other species that cytochromec 4 shows a strong affinity toward the membrane, and similar to what we found in Thiobacillus, this hemeprotein is generally detected both in the soluble and membrane fractions of cells (41Pettigrew G.W. Brown K.R. Biochem. J. 1988; 252: 427-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The EPR spectrum of the purified 46-kDa cytochrome did not resemble those typically found for cytochromec 1. 4D. Lemesle-Meunier and W. Nitschke, unpublished results. Moreover, Bonnefoy and co-workers (42Appia-Ayme C. Bengrine A. Cavazza C. Giudici-Orticoni M.-T. Bruschi M. Chippaux M. Bonnefoy V. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1998; 167: 171-177PubMed Google Scholar) have cloned and sequenced the gene coding for a c-type cytochrome, named cyc2, in the T. ferrooxidans ATCC 33020 strain, which is 67% identical and 86% similar to the N-terminal amino acid sequence of the 46-kDa cytochrome of our strain. This suggests that the cyc2gene encodes a protein equivalent to the 46-kDa cytochrome of our strain (19Elbehti A. Lemesle-Meunier D. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1996; 136: 51-56Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 42Appia-Ayme C. Bengrine A. Cavazza C. Giudici-Orticoni M.-T. Bruschi M. Chippaux M. Bonnefoy V. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1998; 167: 171-177PubMed Google Scholar). No significant homologies to other cytochromes were detected in data banks, indicating that cyc2 does not correspond to cytochrome c 1. Moreover, thecyc2 gene is cotranscribed with cytochromec 4 (cyc1), subunits 1–4 of cytochrome oxidase, and the rusticyanin genes, suggesting that all these components belong to the downhill electron transfer chain toward reduction of oxygen (43.Appia-Ayme, C., Caractérisation d'un Operon Codant pour 7 Proteines Transporteurs d'Electrons Chez Thiobacillus ferrooxidans.Ph.D. thesis, 1998, University of Marseille II, Marseille, France.Google Scholar). 5C. Appia and V. Bonnefoy, manuscript in preparation. Only the 30-kDa cytochrome therefore remains as a possible candidate for cytochrome c 1. Since cytochromec 4 was present in the membrane fragments (as discussed above), it must contribute to the optical α-peak at 552 nm. By comparison with the reported midpoint potential of soluble cytochrome c 4 from T. ferrooxidans(10Cavazza C. Giudici-Orticoni M.-T. Nitschke W. Appia C. Bonnefoy V. Bruschi M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 242: 308-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), the components titrating at 360 and 410 mV at pH 7.4 and at 350 and 430 mV at pH 3.5 are attributed to the two hemes of cytochromec 4. It is, however, difficult at present to decide which of the two redox species at 240 and 560 mV (pH 3.5) and at 150 and 485 mV (pH 7.4) belongs to cytochrome c 1and which one to the 46-kDa cytochrome. The redox titration of cytochromeb at pH 7.4 shows the existence of a low midpoint potential heme bL (E m = −169 mV) and a high midpoint potential heme bH (E m = +20 mV); when the pH is lowered to 3.5, the heme bL midpoint potential increases in order to reach a value close to that of heme bH, which in turn is pH-independent. The two distinct types of bc 1-specific inhibitors represented by antimycin A and HQNO on one hand and stigmatellin on the other hand induce a shift in the absorption spectrum of cytochrome b. The occurrence of a bathochromic or hypsochromic shift in the absorption spectrum of a hemic component induced by a ligand means that the binding of the ligand affects the electronic surroundings of the heme. The red shifts induced by center N inhibitors show a maximum at 564 nm and a minimum at 556 nm in beef heart bc 1complex, whereas those induced by center P inhibitors have a maximum at 568 nm and a minimum at 560 nm (32von Jagow G. Engel W.D. FEBS Lett. 1981; 136: 19-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). The values of these maxima and minima associated with a specific inhibitor may be slightly different, depending on the organism or on the material used (i.e.purified bc 1 complex or submitochondrial particles). In all cases studied, the maxima and minima of the red shifts induced by the Qn center inhibitors were consistently observed at a lower wavelength than those induced by the Qp center inhibitors; this indicates that Qnsite inhibitors predominantly influence the surroundings of the bH heme, whereas Qp site inhibitors influence that of the bL center (31Kamenski Y.A. Konstantinov A.A. Kunz W.S. Surkov S.A. Biological Membranes. 2. Harwood Academic Publisher GmbH and OPA, Ltd., Amsterdam1985: 100-119Google Scholar, 32von Jagow G. Engel W.D.

Biochem. 1988; 176: 385-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The red shift induced by stigmatellin had a maximum at 568 nm and a minimum at 555–557 nm with a shoulder at 562 nm, which indicates that this inhibitor mainly influences the heme bL center (34von Jagow G. Ohnishi T. FEBS Lett. 1985; 185: 311-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). In this study, we present data on the spectral shifts induced by these inhibitors in spheroplasts from T. ferrooxidans. The results show that the two distinct classes of inhibitors, antimycin and HQNO on one hand and stigmatellin on the other hand, induce distinguishable red shifts in the absorption band of cytochrome b in this species. This demonstrates that the binding of antimycin and HQNO occurs on cytochrome b near a heme center with an α-band maximum at ∼562 nm, whereas stigmatellin binds to another heme b center peaking at ∼564 nm. The striking similarities to typical cytochrome bc 1 complexes therefore provide evidence for the existence of a dihemic cytochrome b inT. ferrooxidans. The experimental results furthermore show that antimycin and HQNO induced a red shift in the absorption band of cytochrome birrespective of the pH of the medium, although yielding more symmetrical S-shaped curves at pH 7.4 than at pH 3.5, whereas stigmatellin induced a significant red shift only when the suspension medium was at pH 3.5; the red shift was comparatively weak at pH 7.4. These findings indicate that, at neutral pH, the binding domain for stigmatellin is modified and is no longer able to accommodate the inhibitor. This in turn suggests that the antimycin- and HQNO-binding domains are located on the cytoplasmic side of the membrane, which is in contact with a near-neutral pH (around pH 6.5) (36Cox J.C. Nicholls D.G. Ingledew W.J. Biochem. J. 1979; 178: 195-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), whereas the stigmatellin-binding domain is located on the periplasmic side of the membrane, which is in contact with an acidic pH. The EPR studies performed on a highly concentrated, ascorbate-reduced membrane preparation of T. ferrooxidans clearly showed the presence of a [2Fe-2S] Rieske center in this bacterium: the spectral parameters (gy = 1.90 and gx = 1.74) and the inhibitor sensitivity are characteristic of this compound. The gx trough at g = 1.74 is at unusually high magnetic fields as compared with other cytochromebc 1 complexes and rather resembles the spectral parameters reported for the chloroplastb 6 f complex. The gx signal observed at pH 7.4 was seen to broaden and shift toward lower magnetic fields when the pH became more acidic (pH 3.5), most probably reflecting the fact that the quinone pool is oxidized at neutral pH, but reduced at acidic pH. It is noteworthy that in allbc 1 complexes studied so far, the gxsignal of the Rieske protein is sharp in the presence of oxidized quinone, but shifts toward higher fields and broadens considerably when ubiquinone becomes reduced. In theb 6 f complex, the gx trough was seen to shift toward lower fields in the presence of reduced plastoquinone. The T. ferrooxidans Rieske center exhibited unusual characteristics with regard to inhibitor sensitivity at both studied pH values. In fact, the three inhibitors induced a shift of the gx trough to lower field positions, contrary to what is usually observed in both the bc 1 (34von Jagow G. Ohnishi T. FEBS Lett. 1985; 185: 311-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 44Tsai A.L. Kauten R. Palmer G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 806: 418-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) andb 6 f (45Riedel A. Rutherford W. Hauska G. Müller A. Nitschke W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17838-17844Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) complexes. So far, similar downfield shifts of the gx signal of the Rieske protein have only been observed in Heliobacterium chlorum (46Liebl U. Rutherford A.W. Nitschke W. FEBS Lett. 1990; 261: 427-430Crossref Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In addition, the [2Fe-2S] center of the T. ferrooxidansRieske protein shows further particular features. 1) Its midpoint potential is ∼150 mV higher than that typically measured in cytochrome bc 1 complexes (47Brugna M. Nitschke W. Asso M. Guigliarelli B. Lemesle-Meunier D. Schmidt C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16766-16772Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). This is consistent with the fact that higher redox potentials have been obtained with almost all of the electron transfer components ofT. ferrooxidans as compared with other species. 2) The pK value of its pH-dependant redox midpoint potential is more acidic than that found in neutrophilic systems, but turned out to be close to that observed on the Rieske protein from another acidophilic bacterium, i.e. Sulfolobus acidocaldarius(47Brugna M. Nitschke W. Asso M. Guigliarelli B. Lemesle-Meunier D. Schmidt C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16766-16772Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Membrane preparations from T. ferrooxidans were found to transfer electrons from quinol to cytochrome c via thebc 1 complex at neutral pH; in spheroplasts and at acidic external pH values, the bc 1 complex functions in reverse via a proton-motive force-dependent mechanism.2 Fig. 5 shows the thermodynamic profile of the T. ferrooxidans bc 1complex when the value of the external pH is 7.4 (Fig. 5 B) or 3.5 (Fig. 5 C) compared with the profiles of thebc 1 and b 6 fcomplexes (Fig. 5 A, continuous and dashed boxes, respectively). Fig. 5 visualizes the positions of hemes bL and bH close to the bulk phase and the cytosol, respectively, as is the case for the typicalbc 1 complexes and as is suggested by our results to also apply to the T. ferrooxidans bc 1complex. As can be seen from Fig. 5, the difference inE m values at pH 7.4 (external pH) between the hydroquinone/quinone couple and the Rieske center is much higher than in usualbc 1/b 6 fcomplexes. On the other hand, the E m values of the cytochrome b redox centers are closer to those observed in the b 6 f complex than in thebc 1 complex. Under physiological conditions,i.e. at acidic external pH, the bc 1complex functions in the reverse direction, and its thermodynamic profile is reminiscent of that of theb 6 f complex, except for the ΔE m between the two b hemes. Based on these data, hypotheses describing the reverse electron transfer mechanism in theT. ferrooxidans bc 1 complex can be formulated (Fig. 5): a proton-motive force would be required to enable electrons from the iron-sulfur protein (E m = 480 mV at pH 3.5) and protons from the periplasmic side of the membrane to move toward center P, where reduction of ubiquinone (E m ∼ 340 mV at pH 3.5) would take place. The hydroquinone thus formed at the acidic external pH (E m ∼ 340 mV) would move to the Qn center in contact with the cytosolic neutral pH (E m ∼ 100 mV), reducing heme bH, which then would in turn reduce heme bL. The electron transfer between the two b hemes would be facilitated by their close midpoint potential values at acidic pH. In subsequent cycles, hydroquinone would be reduced by 1 electron from the Rieske center and 1 electron from heme bL (the electron transfer between reduced heme bL and quinone being thermodynamically favorable). Experiments are in progress to obtain a better understanding of the reverse electron transfer mechanism in the T. ferrooxidans bc 1 complex. We are grateful to P. Brivet and G. Brasseur for fruitful discussions, C. Appia and V. Bonnefoy for communicating results prior to publication, and R.

Immun. 1995; 63: 4495-4500Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), or alterations in stimulus-induced intracellular calcium gradients related to decreased production of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (4Olivier M. Baimbridge K.G. Reiner N.E. J. Immunol. 1992; 148: 1188-1196PubMed Google Scholar).Leishmania also inhibits protein kinase C (PKC)-dependent signaling in host macrophages as evidenced by alterations in PKC translocation and activity (5Olivier M. Brownsey R.W. Reiner N.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7481-7485Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) and decreased expression of the transcriptional regulatory protein c-fos(6Moore K.J. Labrecque S. Matlashewski G. J. Immunol. 1993; 150: 4457-4465PubMed Google Scholar). Some of these effects may be ascribed to the properties of lipophosphoglycan (LPG), the major surface glycoconjugate ofLeishmania, which has been shown to inhibit macrophage PKC-dependent signaling (7Frankenburg S. Leibovici V. Mansbach N. Turco S.J. Rosen G. J. Immunol. 1990; 145: 4284-4289PubMed Google Scholar) as well as the activity of purified PKC in vitro (8McNeely T.B. Turco S.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1987; 148: 653-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Thus, phagocytosis of LPG-coated beads inhibited phosphorylation of both a PKC-specific substrate peptide and myristoylated alanine-rich C kinase substrate (MARCKS), an endogenous PKC substrate in murine macrophages (9Descoteaux A. Matlashewski G. Turco S.J. J. Immunol. 1992; 149: 3008-3015PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, depletion of PKC rendered macrophages more permissive for the proliferation of intracellular Leishmania suggesting that PKC-dependent events might contribute to parasite destruction (9Descoteaux A. Matlashewski G. Turco S.J. J. Immunol. 1992; 149: 3008-3015PubMed Google Scholar). MARCKS and MARCKS-related protein (MRP), also known as MacMARCKS (Macrophage-MARCKS), are members of a highly acidic myristoylated family of PKC substrates widely distributed in diverse cell types including macrophages (10Aderem A. Cell. 1992; 71: 713-716Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar, 11Blackshear P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1501-1504Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of MARCKS proteins following activation of PKC has been observed in fibroblasts (12Blackshear P.J. Witters L.A. Girard P.R. Kuo J.F. Quamo S.N. J. Biol.

Nature. 1988; 332: 362-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) and neutrophils (15Thelen M. Rosen A. Nairn A.C. Aderem A. Nature. 1991; 351: 320-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). Both proteins are essential for brain development and survival as shown by mice deficient in the genesmacs or mrp (16Wu M. Chen D.F. Sasaoka T. Tonegawa S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2110-2115Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 17Stumpo D.J. Bock C.B. Tuttle J.S. Blackshear P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 944-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). MARCKS has been shown to cross-link actin filaments in vitro(18Hartwig J.H. Thelen M. Rosen A. Janmey P.A. Nairn A.C. Aderem A. Nature. 1992; 356: 618-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar). In macrophages, MARCKS colocalizes with actin, vinculin, and talin at the site of attachment of the cytoskeleton to the plasma membrane (19Allen L.H. Aderem A. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 182: 829-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar, 20Rosen A. Keenan K.F. Thelen M. Nairn A.C. Aderem A. J. Exp. Med. 1990; 172: 1211-1215Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). MRP colocalizes with paxillin at membrane ruffles at the leading edge of spreading macrophages, suggesting that it also associates with the actin cytoskeleton (21Li J. Zhu Z. Bao Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12985-12990Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Consequently, MARCKS and MRP are thought to regulate the actin cytoskeleton and thereby participate in major cellular responses such as phagocytosis, secretion, motility, mitogenesis, and membrane trafficking. Expression of MARCKS and MRP is strongly up-regulated in macrophages stimulated with bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (22Li J. Aderem A. Cell. 1992; 70: 791-801Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) or zymosan (23Aderem A.A. Keum M.M. Pure E. Cohn Z.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 5817-5821Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). LPS stimulation increases MRP steady state mRNA levels 30-fold in murine macrophages, and high levels persist for more than 8 h (22Li J. Aderem A. Cell. 1992; 70: 791-801Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). MARCKS mRNA and protein expression can be decreased in fibroblasts through either PKC-dependent or -independent pathways by a post-transcriptional mechanism (24Brooks S.F. Herget T. Broad S. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14212-14218Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Wolfman A. Wingrove T.G. Blackshear P.J. Macara I.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 16546-16552Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). MARCKS concentrations may also be regulated by specific proteolytic cleavage of the unphosphorylated protein by a cysteine protease (26Laumas S. Abdel-Ghany M. Leister K. Resnick R. Kandrach A. Racker E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 3021-3025Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 27Spizz G. Blackshear P.J. J. Biol.

Chem. 1997; 272: 23833-23842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). To our knowledge, no reports concerning the down-regulation of MRP are available. Inasmuch as MRP is a major PKC substrate in macrophages, we have examined the expression of MRP in response to infection with Leishmaniapromastigotes. Our finding that Leishmania infection markedly depresses MRP levels may provide an important mechanism for regulating PKC-dependent effector function in macrophages. CBA/J mice were purchased from Harlan (Horst, The Netherlands) and were used between 8 and 16 weeks of age. Recombinant murine IFN-γ produced by Genentech Inc. was kindly supplied by Boehringer Ingelheim (Vienna, Austria). Recombinant human tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α was a gift of Dr. P. Schneider (Epalinges, Switzerland). LPS (Escherichia coli055:B5) was purchased from Difco Laboratories, (Detroit, MI). Zymosan A, latex beads (1.07 μ), pepstatin A, and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG were purchased from Sigma. Heat-killed (autoclaved) Streptococcus mitis was a gift of Dr. D. Le Roy (Lausanne). LPG isolated from Leishmania donovani was kindly provided by Dr. S. Turco (University of Kentucky). Aprotinin, leupeptin, and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride were purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals GmbH (Rotkreuz, Switzerland). Leishmania major promastigotes, strains MRHO/SU/59/P and MRHO/IR/75/ER designated as LV39 and IR75, respectively, were grown at 26 °C in Dulbecco's minimal essential medium (DMEM, Life Technologies, Inc., Basel, Switzerland) on blood agar (29Behin R. Mauël J. Sordat B. Exp. Parasitol. 1979; 48: 81Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Promastigotes of Leishmania mexicana strain MNYC/62/M379, L. donovani strain LV636 and the LPG-deficientL. major strain L119 (30Murray P.J. Handman E. Glaser T.A. Spithill T.W. Exp. Parasitol. 1990; 71: 294-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) were propagated in 10% fetal bovine serum-supplemented HOSMEM II medium (31Berens R.L. Marr J.J. J. Parasitol. 1978; 64: 160Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). For macrophage infection, stationary phase parasites were washed and resuspended in DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Bone marrow-derived macrophages were obtained by in vitro differentiation of bone marrow precursor cells as described previously (32Meerpohl H.-G. Lohmann-Matters M.L. Fischer H. Eur. J. Immunol. 1976; 6: 213-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells flushed from mouse tibia and femurs were grown in DMEM with 20% horse serum (Life Technologies, Inc.) and 30% L cell-conditioned medium. Day 10–11 macrophages were detached by pipetting, suspended in DMEM and 10% fetal bovine serum, and distributed in 35-mm tissue culture dishes (3 × 106 macrophages/dish) or in 24-well cell culture plates (5 × 105macrophages/well), each well containing a round sterile glass coverslip. After 24 h, macrophages were washed and stimulated with IFN-γ and/or TNF-α or LPS in the presence or absence ofLeishmania (5 parasites/macrophage unless indicated otherwise). To quantitate phagocytosis of Leishmania, coverslips were removed 24 h after infection, rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), fixed and stained with Diff-Quick (Mertz and Dade, Düdingen, Switzerland) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After 24 h of macrophage activation, 100 μl of supernatants were harvested for nitrite determination (33Ding A.H. Nathan C.F. Struehr D.J. J. Immunol. 1988; 141: 2407-2412PubMed Google Scholar). Macrophage supernatants were mixed with an equal volume of Griess reagent and incubated for 10 min at room temperature. Absorbance was measured at 550 nm in a micro-enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay reader (Dynatech MR5000) using a 690-nm reference filter. NO2− concentration (μm) was determined using NaNO2 as a standard. Aliquots of [9,10-3H]myristic acid (Amersham, Zurich Switzerland, 53 Ci/mmol) in ethanol were dried under a stream of nitrogen gas, dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO) and diluted in DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Macrophages cultured in 35-mm tissue culture plates (3 × 106 cells/plate) as described above were washed and stimulated with IFN-γ + TNF-α for 4 h. Medium was then aspirated, and 1 ml of fresh medium containing IFN-γ + TNF-α and 50 μCi of [3H]myristic acid in Me2SO (final concentration 0.4%) or Me2SO alone in the presence or absence of LV39 promastigotes (15 × 106/plate) was added. After 6 h, macrophages were washed 3 times with PBS, and cell lysates were prepared as described below. For routine Western blot analysis, macrophages were washed three times with PBS and detached with ice-cold PBS containing 5 μg/ml pepstatin, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin and 10 μg/ml aprotinin. Samples were sonicated and total cellular protein was measured by the micro-bicinchoninic acid assay (Pierce). Laemmli sample buffer was then added, and samples were placed in a 100 °C heat block for 5 min. For some experiments, parallel samples were prepared by adding heated SDS sample buffer directly to the tissue culture plates. Similar results were obtained for lysates prepared by these 2 protocols (not shown). For experiments involving radiolabeled macrophages, washed cells were lysed in PBS containing the same protease inhibitors and 0.5% (v/v) Triton X-100. After determination of total cellular protein, macrophage lysates were heated to 100 °C for 5 min and centrifuged at 11,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C to obtain a heat-stable protein fraction (22Li J. Aderem A. Cell. 1992; 70: 791-801Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Supernatants were collected, and aliquots for SDS-PAGE were prepared in Laemmli sample buffer as described above. For Western blot analysis of total cell lysates, equal amounts of protein (30 μg) were electrophoresed in a 12% polyacrylamide gel, electroblotted to nitrocellulose, and probed with a polyclonal rabbit antibody recognizing murine MRP. The anti-MRP antibody was raised against purified recombinant unmyristoylated MRP (34Vergères G. Manenti S. Weber T. Stürzinger C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19879-19887Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) by injection of 30 μg of protein in complete Freund's adjuvant followed by four subsequent injections of 30 μg in incomplete Freund's adjuvant. The anti-MRP antibody recognizes both myristoylated and unmyristoylated MRP as well as MRP phosphorylated in vitro by the catalytic subunit of PKC (35Schleiff E. Schmitz A. McIlhinney R.A. Manenti S. Vergères G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26794-26802Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). 2G. Vergères, unpublished data. Anti-MRP was used as a 1:2000 dilution of serum followed by a 1:5000 dilution of horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG. Immunoreactive MRP was detected with supersignal chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce). Films exposed to chemiluminescent blots were scanned on a ScanJet 4c/T densitometer (Hewlett Packard, Geneva, Switzerland) using the Adobe Photoshop software package (Adobe Systems, Inc., Mountain View, CA) and NIH image 1.60 software (NIH Division of Computer Research and Technology). For experiments with radiolabeled macrophages, aliquots containing the equivalent of 100 μg of total cellular protein were electrophoresed in 12% polyacylamide gels. Gels containing radiolabeled protein were treated with 0.13 m salicylic acid in 10% v/v methanol, pH 7.0, dried, and exposed to x-ray film at −70 °C. Fluorographs were scanned on the ScanJet 4c/T densitometer. Immunofluorescence studies were performed using a polyclonal rabbit antibody (prepared by Eurogentec, Seraing, Belgium) directed against a synthetic peptide containing the 15 C-terminal amino acids of murine MRP preceded by the 21 amino acid tetanus toxoid P30 helper epitope (36Valmori D. Pessi A. Bianchi E. Corradin G. J. Immunol. 1992; 149: 717-721PubMed Google Scholar). Immune serum recognizing murine MRP in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and Western blot analyses (not shown) was affinity purified by HiTrapN-hydroxysuccinimide-activated affinity column chromatography (Pharmacia LKB Biotechnology, Uppsala, Sweden). Control or Leishmania-infected macrophages were cultured on glass coverslips with or without IFN-γ + TNF-α as described above. After 24 h, macrophages were washed with medium without serum, fixed, and permeabilized with ice-cold methanol for 1 min, dried, and frozen at −20 °C. Cells were rehydrated with cold PBS and incubated for 30 min with 1% bovine serum albumin in PBS at room temperaure before staining. Coverslips were then incubated with affinity purified rabbit anti-MRP antibody for 1 h at room temperature followed by a 50 min incubation with fluorescein-conjugated AffiniPure donkey anti-rabbit IgG (H+L) (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Westgrove, PA). Antibodies were diluted in PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin. Coverslips were mounted in Citifluor (Kent Scientific and Industrial Projects, UK) and stored at 4 °C. Microscopy was performed using a Zeiss Axioskop microscope fitted with a 100x Plan Neofluar objective. Murine macrophages activated with IFN-γ + TNF-α produce high levels of nitric oxide (NO) and are capable of killing intracellularLeishmania (37Mauël J. Ransijn A. Buchmuller-Rouiller Y. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1991; 49: 73-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). We examined the expression of MRP in normal and activated macrophages by Western blot analysis of total cell lysates. Because of its acidic amino acid composition, MRP, whose calculated molecular mass is 20 kDa, exhibits anomalous migration on SDS gels and is recognized as a 42-kDa doublet in Western blots (38Zhu Z. Bao Z. Li J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17652-17655Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar,39Rosé S.D. Byers D.M. Morash S.C. Fedoroff S. Cook H.W. J. Neurosci. Res. 1996; 44: 235-242Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in panels A and B of Fig.1, IFN-γ + TNF-α increased the level of immunoreactive MRP protein after 4 h of culture (lane 2) though much stronger induction was observed after 24 h (lane 6). A comparison with known amounts of recombinant murine MRP (lanes 9 and 10) indicates that MRP is present at a concentration of approximately 1 ng/μg total protein in macrophages activated with IFN-γ + TNF-α. To determine whether infection by Leishmania modulates MRP expression, macrophages were challenged with LV39 promastigotes at the same time as stimulation with IFN-γ + TNF-α. Under these conditions, a strong decrease in MRP levels was consistently observed either 4 or 24 h after infection (Fig. 1, A and B, lanes 4 and 8). In many experiments, Leishmaniaalso decreased the level of MRP in control unstimulated macrophages (Fig. 1 B, lane 3; Fig. 4, lane 3, below and data not shown). As shown in Fig. 1 C, a strong increase in MRP was also observed when macrophages were stimulated with TNF-α (lane 4) or LPS (lane 5) alone, and LV39 inhibited such induction (lanes 7 and 8). LV39 also inhibited the weak induction of MRP obtained with IFN-γ alone (lanes 3 and 6).Figure 4Depletion of MRP by differentLeishmania promastigotes. Promastigotes of LV39,L. donovani (L dono), or L119 were added to macrophage cultures (5 parasites per macrophage) in the presence or absence of IFN-γ (50 units/ml) plus TNF-α (250 ng/ml). NO production measured as NO2− release in 24-h supernatants is shown in panel A. MRP levels at 24 or 4 h determined by Western blot analysis of total cell lysates are shown in panels B and C, respectively. Note because MRP is found at lower levels 4 h after activation compared with 24 h, the blot in panel C was exposed for a longer period as evident from the stronger rMRP signal.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) We then examined whether it was possible to reduce MRP levels by challenging macrophages with LV39 at various times after addition of IFN-γ + TNF-α. As shown in Fig. 2, MRP levels in lysates prepared 24 h after cytokine stimulation were strongly reduced when LV39 was added either together with the activating stimuli (lane 4) or when added 8 h after activation (lane 5). Similarly, addition of LV39 24 or 48 h after activation reduced the amount of MRP in 48-h (lane 8) or in 72-h (lane 10) lysates, respectively. As an alternative proof that MRP levels were decreased inLeishmania-infected cells, the incorporation of [3H]myristic acid was examined. MRP expression was first induced for 4 h with IFN-γ + TNF-α, followed by the addition of fresh medium containing [3H]myristic acid in the presence or absence of LV39 promastigotes. After an additional 6 h, heat-stable fractions of total cell lysates were prepared and subjected to SDS-PAGE. Fluorography revealed three major proteins, a 74–78-kDa protein, most probably MARCKS, an uncharacterized protein of approximately 48–50 kDa (designated p50), and a broad 42–46-kDa doublet corresponding to MRP (Fig. 3). Western blot analyses, performed in parallel on the myristic acid-labeled lysates, confirmed the identity of MARCKS and MRP (data not shown). In agreement with data presented above, myristoylated MRP levels were increased upon cytokine activation and decreased inLeishmania-infected macrophages. Interestingly, MARCKS levels were also strongly decreased in Leishmania-infected cells. Although little or no induction of MARCKS expression was observed in macrophages stimulated with IFN-γ + TNF-α, it should be pointed out that constitutive levels of MARCKS are generally higher and induction of MARCKS mRNA and protein is both less pronounced and occurs with more rapid kinetics when compared with MRP (22Li J. Aderem A. Cell. 1992; 70: 791-801Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 39Rosé S.D. Byers D.M. Morash S.C. Fedoroff S. Cook H.W. J. Neurosci. Res. 1996; 44: 235-242Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Expression of the third heat-stable protein, p50, was increased by cytokine stimulation but, unlike MRP and MARCKS, was unaffected byLeishmania. In addition to the three major bands discussed above, additional lower molecular weight bands were observed for the samples from infected macrophages (lanes 3 and 4) possibly representing degradation products of MRP and/or MARCKS (see “Discussion”). Several additional species of Leishmania were then compared with LV39 for their effects on MRP levels. Because LPG may be responsible for certain inhibitory effects of Leishmania, the LPG-deficient L. major strain L119 (30Murray P.J. Handman E. Glaser T.A. Spithill T.W. Exp. Parasitol. 1990; 71: 294-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) was also tested. All parasites decreased MRP levels in macrophages stimulated with IFN-γ + TNF-α albeit to somewhat different degrees. L119 strongly decreased MRP levels (Fig. 4 B) as didL. mexicana and another L. major strain IR75 (not shown). However, L. donovani was consistently less potent in down-regulating MRP in either 4- or 24-h lysates (Fig. 4 B). Because we and others (40Corradin S.B. Mauël J. J. Immunol. 1991; 146: 279-285PubMed Google Scholar, 41Corradin S.B. Buchmüller-Rouiller Y. Mauël J. Eur. J. Immunol. 1991; 21: 2553-2558Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 42Green S.J. Crawford R.M. Hockmeyer J.T. Meltzer M.S. Nacy C.A. J. Immunol. 1990; 145: 4290-4297PubMed Google Scholar) have shown that Leishmaniastrongly up-regulates NO production by murine macrophages, NO2− release was determined in parallel. A very similar enhancement of NO production was observed regardless of whichLeishmania was used (Fig. 4 A). As shown in Table I, infection measured by microscopic examination of coverslips 24 h after parasite challenge was lower for both L119 and L. donovani than for LV39. However, 4 h after infection, parasite loads for L119 andL. donovani were equal to or greater than for LV39. Both L119 and L. donovani were rapidly destroyed by host macrophages even in the absence of cytokine activation (Table I). LV39 persists in the presence or absence of cytokines for up to 24 h (Table I) (37Mauël J. Ransijn A. Buchmuller-Rouiller Y. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1991; 49: 73-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) but is subsequently eliminated by 48–72 h of culture (37Mauël J. Ransijn A. Buchmuller-Rouiller Y. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1991; 49: 73-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar).Table IQuantitation of macrophage infectionParasites/100 macrophages4 h24 hLV395480+IFN-γ/TNF-α6844L. donovani685+IFN-γ/TNF-α681L119848+IFN-γ/TNF-α1189Data is presented from one of two independent experiments. Open table in a new tab Data is presented from one of two independent experiments. The effect of other phagocytic stimuli on MRP levels was also examined. Both zymosan and latex beads were previously shown to augment cytokine-dependent NO production similar toLeishmania (40Corradin S.B. Mauël J. J. Immunol. 1991; 146: 279-285PubMed Google Scholar), and these results were confirmed as shown in Fig. 5 A. As shown in Fig.5 B, neither latex beads (lane 4) nor zymosan (lane 9) markedly reduced the levels of MRP observed in activated macrophages (lanes 2 and 7) unlike the strong inhibition obtained with LV39 (lanes 5 and13). Indeed, zymosan increased MRP levels when added alone (lane 8) in agreement with a previous report by Aderemet al. (23Aderem A.A. Keum M.M. Pure E. Cohn Z.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 5817-5821Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Addition of LV39 together with zymosan (lane 10) resulted in lower levels of MRP induction than obtained with zymosan alone (lane 8). Like zymosan, the Gram-positive bacterium S. mitis up-regulated NO production and MRP expression (lanes 14 and 15). MRP was localized in murine macrophages by indirect immunofluorescence using an affinity-purified anti-C-terminal peptide antibody, which recognizes a single 42-kDa doublet in Western blots of macrophage lysates (data not shown). Strong punctate staining of MRP was observed in the cytosol of activated macrophages (Fig.6). In agreement with Western blot analyses, staining was much less intense in nonactivated macrophages or in macrophages infected with Leishmania. No staining was observed with a control rabbit IgG or in the absence of primary antibody (not shown). Recently, in vitro studies have demonstrated thatLeishmania is capable of interfering with host macrophage signal transduction machinery (1Bogdan C. Gessner A. Solbach W. Rollinghoff M. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1996; 8: 517-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 2Reiner N.E. Immunol. Today. 1994; 15: 374-381Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar) thereby modifying the capacity of this cell to combat infection. One well studied effect ofLeishmania involves inhibition of macrophage PKC activity and consequently PKC-dependent cell function. Results presented here suggest that Leishmania might also regulate PKC-dependent cell function in a more selective fashion by decreasing levels of MRP, a major PKC substrate in macrophages. Addition of Leishmania promastigotes to macrophages strongly reduced levels of cytokine-induced MRP as early as 4 h after infection. To date, all species or strains of Leishmaniapromastigotes tested were capable of down-regulating MRP levels in response to IFN-γ + TNF-α. This effect did not require viable parasites as heat-killed (15 min, 56 °C) promastigotes exhibited comparable activity (data not shown). Other phagocytic stimuli including yeast cell wall zymosan, latex beads, or heat-killed S. mitis had either no effect or increased MRP levels by themselves. Interestingly, the LPG-deficient strain L119 was as efficient as LV39 suggesting that LPG is not responsible for the effect ofLeishmania infection on MRP. Moreover 10 or 25 μm purified LPG from L. donovani (kind gift of S. Turco) had no inhibitory effect on macrophage MRP expression in two independent experiments (data not shown). The reason for the less pronounced down-regulation of MRP observed with L. donovaniis unknown. However, it appears unlikely that decreased inhibition is due entirely to a more rapid parasite clearance from macrophage cultures because L119, which was as effective as LV39 in depleting MRP, was also efficiently killed by nonactivated macrophages. It is highly unlikely that the observed down-regulation of MRP inLeishmania-infected macrophages reflects an overall inhibition of protein synthesis or cell function for several reasons. Nitrocellulose blots stained with Ponceau red showed no significant differences in lanes containing lysates from infected versusnoninfected macrophages (not shown). Secondly, the expression of an uncharacterized 50-kDa heat-stable myristoylated protein was unaffected by Leishmania infection. Third, we have previously shown that Leishmania increases bone marrow macrophage synthesis of TNF-α and prostaglandin E2 in an identical experimental system (40Corradin S.B. Mauël J. J. Immunol. 1991; 146: 279-285PubMed Google Scholar). Finally, as shown previously (40Corradin S.B. Mauël J. J. Immunol. 1991; 146: 279-285PubMed Google Scholar, 41Corradin S.B. Buchmüller-Rouiller Y. Mauël J. Eur. J. Immunol. 1991; 21: 2553-2558Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 42Green S.J. Crawford R.M. Hockmeyer J.T. Meltzer M.S. Nacy C.A. J. Immunol. 1990; 145: 4290-4297PubMed Google Scholar) and confirmed here, phagocytosis of Leishmania strongly up-regulates the synthesis of NO. We considered the possibility that down-regulation of MRP resulted from an effect of Leishmania on TNF-α receptor expression. However, similar results were obtained with other stimuli capable of up-regulating MRP levels including LPS and zymosan. Moreover, other markers of macrophage activation such as NO production or TNF-α synthesis (40Corradin S.B. Mauël J. J. Immunol. 1991; 146: 279-285PubMed Google Scholar) are enhanced under the same conditions. MRP levels in activated macrophages were also dramatically decreased when parasites were added 24 or 48 h after stimulation. As mentioned above, examination of myristic acid incorporation revealed the presence of a 48–50-kDa protein (designated as p50 in our studies) in macrophages stimulated by IFN-γ + TNF-α. The identity of this protein remains unknown though at least two groups (39Rosé S.D. Byers D.M. Morash S.C. Fedoroff S. Cook H.W. J. Neurosci. Res. 1996; 44: 235-242Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 43Aderem A.A. Marratta D.E. Cohn Z.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 6310-6313Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) have previously described myristoylated macrophage proteins of comparable size. Although p50 levels were similar in normal and infected macrophages, the same studies suggested a profound effect ofLeishmania on the levels of MARCKS, a PKC substrate closely related to MRP. Further studies are now in progress to examineLeishmania-dependent modulation of MARCKS expression. Although MRP has been shown to be induced at the transcriptional level by LPS (22Li J. Aderem A. Cell. 1992; 70: 791-801Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), there are no reports concerning factors capable of down-regulating its expression. Down-regulation of MARCKS in fibroblasts can occur through a post-transcriptional decrease in MARCKS mRNA upon incubation with bombesin or platelet-derived growth factor (24Brooks S.F. Herget T. Broad S. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14212-14218Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Down-regulation could be mimicked by short term treatment with phorbol esters and was inhibited by PKC depletion. Somewhat paradoxically, Spizz and Blackshear (28Spizz G. Blackshear P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23833-23842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) showed that PKC-dependent phosphorylation of MARCKS protects the protein from another down-regulatory pathway involving proteolysis by lysosomal cathepsin B. They speculated that targeting of MARCKS to the lysosomal membrane via a putative LAMP1-specific sequence might permit the interaction of cytosolic MARCKS and the lysosomal enzyme. That similar mechanisms might be involved in the regulation of MRP levels is suggested by our observations that the disappearance of radiolabeled MARCKS proteins in Leishmania-infected macrophages correlates with the appearance of lower molecular weight species. Moreover, we recently demonstrated that rMRP is rapidly cleaved by LV39 lysates or by purified Leishmania surface metalloprotease, leishmanolysin, in a cell-free in vitroassay. 3S. Corradin, G. Corradin, J. Mauël, A. Ransijn, M. Rogerro, P. Schneider and G. Vergères, submitted for publication. It remains to be determined if this proteolytic event occurs within the macrophage and, if so, how a Leishmania enzyme, which is presumably restricted to the phagosomal/phagolysosomal compartment might interact with a cytosolic protein such as MRP. In this regard, a recent report by Rittig et al. (44Rittig M.G. Schroppel K. Seack K.H. Sander U. N′Diaye E.N. Maridonneau-Parini I. Solbach W. Bogdan C. Infect. Immun. 1998; 66: 4331-4339Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) provided intriguing evidence that some intracellular promastigotes of L. major are localized in the cytosol of infected macrophages. The implications of MRP down-regulation during Leishmaniainfection are purely speculative for the time being. It has been proposed that down-regulation of PKC might favor parasite survival (9Descoteaux A. Matlashewski G. Turco S.J. J. Immunol. 1992; 149: 3008-3015PubMed Google Scholar). Decreasing the expression of a given PKC substrate could represent an important mechanism for inhibiting specific PKC-dependent effector functions in the macrophage. Evidence of functional alterations in fetal cells from animals lacking MARCKS family proteins or from cell lines expressing incomplete or dominant-negative mutants of MRP or MARCKS is somewhat contradictory (45Aderem A. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1992; 181: 189-207PubMed Google Scholar). In a recent investigation, Underhill et al. (46Underhill D.M. Chen J.M. Allen L.A.H. Aderem A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33619-33623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) reported that MRP is not essential for phagocytosis by macrophages. However, the authors speculated that due to their high effector domain homology, MRP and MARCKS might play overlapping roles explaining the normal phagocytic phenotype of MRP-deficient cells. It is, thus, particularly interesting that Leishmania infection appears to decrease levels of both MARCKS proteins in macrophages. Our data, taken together with the previously documented inhibitory effect of LPG on PKC activity, further establish the ability of Leishmania parasites to circumvent normal PKC-dependent function in macrophages. Finally, we recently showed that peptides corresponding to the effector domain of MARCKS and MRP induce polymerization of monomeric actin and bundling of filamentous actin 4F. Wohnsland, A. A. P. Schmitz, M. O. Steinmetz, U. Aebi, and G. Vergères, submitted for publication. in contrast to comparatively moderate effects found with the intact MARCKS and MRP proteins (18Hartwig J.H. Thelen M. Rosen A. Janmey P.A. Nairn A.C. Aderem A. Nature. 1992; 356: 618-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar). 5F. Wohnsland, M. O. Steinmetz, U. Aebi, and G. Vergères, manuscript in preparation. We postulated that in vivo proteolysis might facilitate the interaction between MARCKS proteins and actin by exposing their effector domain. Thus it is interesting to speculate thatLeishmania-dependent degradation of MRP might in some way modulate the structure and function of the actin cytoskeleton in infected macrophages. We are grateful to Dr. Sam Turco for providing purified LPG and Dr. Pascal Schneider for his generous gift of rTNF-α. We are also grateful to Jeannine Bamat for assistance with immunofluorescence microscopy and to Dr. Giampietro Corradin for advice in preparing the MRP peptide construct.

Previous studies of a chimeric protein (HM-Gal) composed of the membrane domain of HMGR fused to Escherichia coli β-galactosidase, as a replacement of the normal HMGR cytosolic domain, have shown that the regulated degradation of this chimeric protein, HM-Gal, is identical to that of HMGR (Chun, K. T., Bar-Nun, S., and Simoni, R. D. (1990)J. Biol. Chem. 265, 22004–22010; Skalnik, D. G., Narita, H., Kent, C., and Simoni, R. D. (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 6836–6841). Since the cytosolic domain can be replaced with β-galactosidase without effect on regulated degradation, it has been assumed that the cytosolic domain was not important to this process and also that the membrane domain of HMGR was both necessary and sufficient for regulated degradation. In contrast to our previous results with HM-Gal, we observed in this study that replacement of the cytosolic domain of HMGR with various heterologous proteins can have an effect on the regulated degradation, and the effect correlates with the oligomeric state of the replacement cytosolic protein. Chimeric proteins that are oligomeric in structure are relatively stable, and those that are monomeric are unstable. To test the hypothesis that the oligomeric state of the cytosolic domain of HMGR influences degradation, we use an “inducible” system for altering the oligomeric state of a protein in vivo. Using a chimeric protein that contains the membrane domain of HMGR fused to three copies of FK506-binding protein 12, we were able to induce oligomerization by addition of a “double-headed” FK506-like “dimerizer” drug (AP1510) and to monitor the degradation rate of both the monomeric form and the drug-induced oligomeric form of the protein. We show that this chimeric protein, HM-3FKBP, is unstable in the monomeric state and is stabilized by AP1510-induced oligomerization. We also examined the degradation rate of HMGR as a function of concentrations within the cell. HMGR is a functional dimer; therefore, its oligomeric state and, we predict, its degradation rate should be concentration-dependent.

Simoni began his foray into the world of lipids and membranes when he was in graduate school at the University of California, Davis, studying fatty lipid synthesis in plants with Paul Stumpf. Fewer than ten years later, Simoni started his own research program at Stanford University, exploring the biochemistry of cell membrane structure and function. The two Journal of Biological Chemistry (JBC) Classics articles reprinted here review some of Simoni's research on the regulation of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase, which catalyzes the rate-limiting step in the synthesis of sterol and non-sterol isoprenoid products. Full-Text PDF Open Access The endoplasmic reticulum resident membrane protein, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase (HMGR) 1The abbreviations used are: HMGR, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; FKBP, FK506-binding protein 12; Hyg, hygromycin; HA, hemagglutinin; MEM, minimal essential medium; FCS, fetal calf serum; FBS, fetal bovine serum; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; eGFP, enhanced green fluorescent protein; LPS, lipid-poor serum; XGPRT, xanthine guanosylphosphoribosyl- transferase (EC 1.1.1.34; GenBankTM accession number M12705), is the rate-limiting enzyme in the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway, catalyzing the conversion of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA to mevalonate, which is further metabolized to many downstream isoprenoid products as well as cholesterol (1Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Nature. 1990; 343: 425-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (4566) Google Scholar). These downstream metabolites participate in feedback regulation of HMGR to reduce its protein levels when sufficient cholesterol is obtained through exogenous sources, and conversely, flow through the mevalonate pathway is increased by up-regulating synthesis and extending the protein half-life of HMGR when intracellular sterol levels are low (2Edwards P.A.

This phenomenon of regulated HMGR degradation has been a focus of study for many years; however, the mechanism of regulation and the identity of the proteolytic components responsible for degradation remain largely unknown. The topology of HMGR, which is a 97-kDa glycoprotein, consists of two major domains: a transmembrane domain that spans the endoplasmic reticulum membrane eight times and the C-terminal catalytic domain, which contains the active site and resides in the cytosol (6Liscum L.

Cell. 1985; 41: 249-258Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Structural studies of the Pseudomonas mevalonii HMGR counterpart have revealed that the catalytic domain, in which key residues involved in substrate recognition and catalysis are conserved between bacteria and mammals, requires dimerization of two HMGR molecules through this domain to form the substrate-binding and active site (9Lawrence C.M. Rodwell V.W. Stauffacher C.V. Science. 1995; 268: 1758-1762Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). In addition, radiation inactivation studies of HMGR from rat liver have demonstrated that the enzymatically active form of HMGR is a dimer (26Edwards P.A. Kempner E.S. Lan S.F. Erickson S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 10278-10282Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Ness G.C. Pendleton L.C. McCreery M.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 953: 361-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). The membrane domain of HMGR has been of interest due to work that has shown that determinants for regulated degradation reside in this region (8Gil G. Faust J.R. Chin D.J. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Cell. 1985; 41: 249-258Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar, 10Jingami H. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Anderson R.G. Luskey K.L. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 104: 1693-1704Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Experiments in which the cytosolic domain of HMGR was replaced with the soluble Escherichia coli β-galactosidase enzyme showed that the resulting chimera (termed HM-Gal), when stably transfected into Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, exhibits a half-life that mirrors that of HMGR and is similarly subject to sterol-accelerated degradation (11Chun K.T. Bar-Nun S. Simoni R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 22004-22010Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Skalnik D.G. Narita H. Kent C. Simoni R.D. J. Biol.

Chem. 1996; 271: 25630-25638Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Based on this observation, we have assumed that the cytosolic domain was not important and that the membrane domain was both necessary and sufficient to confer regulated degradation. We have now generated several different HMGR fusion proteins with the cytosolic domain replaced with various heterologous proteins. We have discovered that there is an apparent correlation between the oligomeric state of the heterologous cytosolic protein and resulting stability of the fusion protein, with monomeric fusion proteins being degraded relatively rapidly and oligomeric fusion proteins degraded slowly. Based on these findings, we have developed a hypothesis that the oligomeric state of HMGR, determined at least in part by interactions through the cytosolic catalytic domain, plays a role in determination of the degradation rate. In this paper, we have tested this hypothesis using an “inducible oligomerization” system that utilizes FK506-binding protein 12 (FKBP) and the synthetic dimeric drug AP1510 (13Jin L. Asano H. Blau C.A. Blood. 1998; 91: 890-897Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Amara J.F. Clackson T. Rivera V.M. Guo T. Keenan T. Natesan S. Pollock R. Yang W. Courage N.L. Holt D.A. Gilman M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10618-10623Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). The drug FK506 is a well characterized immunosuppressant that binds to FKBPs, mimicking an unknown endogenous ligand and activating the calcineurin signaling pathway (15Liu S.W. Milman G. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 7469-7475Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Fruman D.A. Burakoff S.J. Bierer B.E. FASEB J. 1994; 8: 391-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). AP1510 is a nontoxic, cell-permeable compound that consists essentially of two FK506 derivatives fused together through a linker region and thus has the capability of dimerizing two FKBP-containing proteins in vivo (14Amara J.F. Clackson T. Rivera V.M. Guo T. Keenan T. Natesan S. Pollock R. Yang W. Courage N.L. Holt D.A. Gilman M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10618-10623Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). We have constructed a fusion protein called HM-3FKBP, which consists of three tandem repeats of FKBP fused to the C terminus of the membrane domain of HMGR. Using the dimeric AP1510 drug, we manipulated the oligomeric state of HM-3FKBP in vivo and studied the degradation phenotype both as a monomer and an oligomer. Additionally, we have also fused three FKBP sequences to the C terminus of one of our “fast” monomeric constructs, HM-Hyg, and tested whether AP1510 can stabilize its fast degradation through oligomerization. If the oligomeric state of HMGR is important for stability and degradation, we predict that the level of HMGR expression should influence the relative proportion of monomers and dimers and thus should also influence the degradation rate. We have varied the in vivo expression levels of HMGR by expression from an inducible promoter system, and the results show that the protein is more rapidly degraded at lower concentrations. These findings further support our hypothesis that oligomerization of HMGR molecules through the cytosolic domain stabilizes the protein and that the monomeric state results in faster degradation.

Cells were grown in 60-mm dishes to 70–80% confluency in MEM-FCS or MEM-FBS medium. The following day, the medium was changed to MEM-LPS medium containing 10 μmcompactin and 100 μm sodium mevalonate. After 20 h, cells were starved for 1 h in methionine/cysteine-free minimal essential medium supplemented with 10 μm compactin and 100 μm sodium mevalonate and labeled for 0.5 h in methionine/cysteine-free minimal essential medium containing 10 μm compactin, 100 μm sodium mevalonate, and 100 μCi of Tran35S-label per plate. Cells were chased in MEM-LPS medium supplemented with 10 μm compactin, 100 μm sodium mevalonate, 2 mm methionine, and 2 mm cysteine out to various time points.

Drug concentrations were maintained throughout the experiment in starvation, labeling, and chase media. Double-stable Tet-Off CHO-AA8 cells were treated either with no doxycycline or with various concentrations of doxycycline along with no other reagent or with 2.5 μm 25-hydroxycholesterol or 4 μg/ml calpain inhibitor I (N-acetyl-leucyl-leucyl-norleucinal) (Calbiochem-Novabiochem Corporation) in MEM-LPS medium supplemented with 100 μm sodium mevalonate and 10 μmcompactin for 20 h prior to β-galactosidase activity assays. β-Galactosidase activity assays were performed as described previously (12Skalnik D.G. Narita H. Kent C. Simoni R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6836-6841Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cells seeded in triplicate in 24-well dishes were permeabilized with 50 μg/ml digitonin and incubated at 37 °C with a 1 mg/ml concentration of the colorimetric enzyme substrateo-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactopyranoside until color change was visually detectable. Reactions were stopped by addition of 1 m Na2CO3. Concentration of cleaved product was quantitated using a Beckman DU-64 spectrophotometer. Specific activity values were calculated by normalization to time of incubation and total protein, which was determined on duplicate plates by the method of Lowry et al.(19Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We have now generated several chimeric proteins consisting of the membrane domain of HMGR fused to various heterologous proteins. In the course of analyzing these fusion proteins, we observed that some chimeric proteins are degraded rapidly, whereas others are stable and exhibit normal regulated degradation characteristic of HMGR despite the fact that all constructs have the identical membrane domain from HMGR. We have found that the degradation phenotype correlates with the oligomeric state of the cytosolic domain, with monomeric proteins being degraded rapidly and dimeric and higher order proteins degraded normally. In addition to HM-Gal (HM designates the HMGR membrane domain and is followed by a designation for the heterologous cytosolic protein), another construct we have made is HM-Hyg, which is composed of the HMGR membrane domain fused to the hygromycin phosphotransferase protein, which confers resistance to the antibiotic hygromycin B. We have also constructed HM-XGPRT, which consists of the membrane domain fused to the bacterial xanthine guanosylphosphoribosyltransferase, which enables cells to utilize xanthine as an alternate source for purines. Additionally, we have created HM-eGFP (with the membrane domain fused to enhanced green fluorescent protein) and HM-3HA (with three HA epitope tags attached to the end of the membrane domain). The results of degradation studies by pulse-chase analysis of these proteins in stably transfected cells are shown in TableI.Table IHalf-lives of HMGR membrane domain fusion proteinsConstructCytosolic domaint12Oligomeric state of cytosolic domainNo sterols+SterolshHMGRHMGR catalytic domain8.73.5DimerHM-GalE. coliβ-galactosidase9.74.0TetramerHM-XGPRTE. coli XGPRT7.94.0TrimerHM-3HA3 HA epitope tags4.12.1MonomerHM-HygE. colihygromycin PTaPhosphotransferase.3.62.2MonomerHM-eGFPGreen fluorescent protein5.02.5MonomerConstructs were stably transfected into CHO cells, and half-lives were measured by pulse-chase analysis as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Values presented are the averages of at least three experiments, with the range of values not exceeding 10%.a Phosphotransferase.

Fusion proteins with normal degradation phenotypes include HM-Gal and HM-XGPRT, whereas HM-Hyg, HM-3HA, and HM-eGFP are degraded relatively rapidly (Table I). Consideration of the oligomeric state of these heterologous proteins fused to the membrane domain reveals that β-galactosidase is enzymatically active as a tetramer; xanthine guanosylphosphoribosyltransferase is a trimer (15Liu S.W. Milman G. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 7469-7475Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Pratt D. Subramani S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 8817-8823Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar); and hygromycin phosphotransferase (21Gritz L. Davies J. Gene (Amst.). 1983; 25: 179-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (611) Google Scholar), green fluorescent protein, and the HA epitope tag are monomers, suggesting that the oligomeric state of the cytosolic domain may influence degradation of the membrane domain. We assayed the heterologous cytosolic domains of the chimeras for functional activity as evidence of oligomeric assembly in vivo while fused to the HMGR membrane domain. We detected enzyme activity for HM-Gal (12Skalnik D.G. Narita H. Kent C. Simoni R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6836-6841Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and HM-XGPRT (data not shown), indicating they are present as tetramers and trimers, respectively. HM-Hyg is capable of conferring resistance to hygromycin B in transfected CHO cells (data not shown), suggesting that HM-Hyg is capable of folding correctly and that, most likely, the rapid degradation observed in this construct is not due to misfolding. Similarly, HM-eGFP is also correctly folded as evidenced by detectable GFP fluorescence in transfected cells (data not shown). Based on the correlation between the oligomeric state and degradation phenotype, we hypothesize that interaction between the membrane domains induced through the cytosolic domain is required for normal stability and sterol-regulated degradation to occur. As a first test of our hypothesis, we constructed deletion mutants in which the C-terminal 10–20 amino acids of the β-galactosidase enzyme in HM-Gal were removed since it has been shown that these residues are critical for tetramerization of β-galactosidase and formation of the active enzyme (22Fowler A.V. Zabin I. Science. 1966; 154: 1027-1029Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 23Tsuneoka M. Mekada E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9107-9111Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Removal of these amino acid residues should result in the monomerization of the cytosolic region of HM-Gal. Transfected CHO cell lines expressing either HM-GalΔ10 (missing the C-terminal 10 amino acids) or HM-GalΔ20 (missing the C-terminal 20 amino acids) were analyzed by pulse-chase analysis to measure half-lives. As shown in Fig.1, both deletion mutants, in contrast to full-length HM-Gal, were degraded abnormally fast (Fig. 1, compareA and B with C). The half-life of HM-Gal was ∼9 h, and the presence of sterols reduced it to ∼5 h. For both HM-GalΔ10 and HM-GalΔ20, the half-lives were <2 h, and there was no acceleration by sterols. To demonstrate that our deletion mutants were no longer assembled into tetramers, we measured β-galactosidase activity in these cell lines, as β-galactosidase activity is known to be dependent upon tetramerization of the enzyme. The results in Fig. 2 support the conclusion that tetramerization of β-galactosidase in the deletion mutants has been abolished since HM-GalΔ10 and HM-GalΔ20 cell lines have lost β-galactosidase activity. In these experiments, the HM-Gal/HM-GalΔ10/HM-GalΔ20 β-galactosidase protein ratio was 1:0.8:0.2 (data not shown).Figure 2HM-Gal deletion mutants lose β-galactosidase activity. β-Galactosidase activity was measured in each of the three cell lines as well as in a control vector-only transfected cell line as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Cells were permeabilized with 50 μg/ml digitonin and incubated with 1 mg/mlo-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactopyranoside at 37 °C until color change was visually detectable, and then cleaved product was quantified using a Beckman DU-64 spectrophotometer.

To investigate this lipid signaling in more detail, we characterized the molecular structures of the diradylglycerols and phosphatidic acids in the murine CTLL-2 T-cell line under both basal and stimulated conditions. In resting cells, 1,2-diacylglycerol and 1-O-alkyl-2-acylglycerol subtypes represented 44 and 55% of total diradylglycerol, respectively, and both showed a highly saturated profile containing primarily 16:0 and 18:1 fatty acids. 1-O-Alk-1′-enyl-2-acylglycerol represented 1–2% of total diradylglycerol. Interleukin-2 stimulation did not alter the molecular species profiles, however, it did selectively reduce total 1-O-alkyl-2-acylglycerol by over 50% at 15 min while only causing a 10% drop in 1,2-diacylglycerol. When radiolabeled CTLL-2 cells were challenged with interleukin-2, no change in the cellular content of phosphatidylcholine nor phosphatidylethanolamine was observed thereby ruling out phospholipase C activity as the source of diradylglycerol. In addition, interleukin-2 failed to stimulatede novo synthesis of diradylglycerol. Structural analysis revealed approximately equal amounts of 1,2-diacyl phosphatidic acid and 1-O-alkyl-2-acyl phosphatidic acid under resting conditions, both containing only saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids. After acute (2 and 15 min) interleukin-2 stimulation the total phosphatidic acid mass increased, almost entirely through the formation of 1-O-alkyl-2-acyl species. In vitro assays revealed that both 1,2-diacylglycerol and 1-O-alkyl-2-acylglycerol were substrates for 1,2-diacylglycerol kinase α, the major isoform in CTLL-2 cells, and that the lipid kinase activity was almost totally inhibited by R59949. In conclusion, this investigation shows that, in CTLL-2 cells, 1,2-diacylglycerol kinase α specifically phosphorylates a pre-existing pool of 1-O-alkyl-2-acylglycerol to form the intracellular messenger 1-O-alkyl-2-acyl phosphatidic acid.

Signal transduction by a wide variety of extracellular stimuli involves phospholipid hydrolysis and/or the activation of lipid kinases and phosphatases as a means to generate biologically active lipid second messengers (LSMs). 1The abbreviations used are: LSM, lipid second messenger; DAG, 1,2-diacylglycerol; AAG, 1-O-alkyl-2-acylglycerol; AEAG, 1-O-alk-1′-enyl-2-acylglycerol; PA, phosphatidic acid; IL-2, interleukin-2; PC, phosphatidylcholine; PE, phosphatidylethanolamine; PIP2, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate; DAG-PA, 1,2-diacyl-PA; AAG-PA, 1-O-alkyl-2-acyl-PA; AAG-PC, 1-O-alkyl-2-acyl-PC; AAG-PE, 1-O-alkyl-2-acyl-PE; FAME, fatty acid methyl ester; PLC, phospholipase C; PLD, phospholipase D; DGK, diacylglycerol kinase; PAP, PA phosphatase; DNB, dinitrobenzoyl derivative; PKC, protein kinase C; DRG, diradylglycerol; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatograpy; GC-MS, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry; BSA, bovine serum albumin; HA, hemagglutinin 1The abbreviations used are: LSM, lipid second messenger; DAG, 1,2-diacylglycerol; AAG, 1-O-alkyl-2-acylglycerol; AEAG, 1-O-alk-1′-enyl-2-acylglycerol; PA, phosphatidic acid; IL-2, interleukin-2; PC, phosphatidylcholine; PE, phosphatidylethanolamine; PIP2, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate; DAG-PA, 1,2-diacyl-PA; AAG-PA, 1-O-alkyl-2-acyl-PA; AAG-PC, 1-O-alkyl-2-acyl-PC; AAG-PE, 1-O-alkyl-2-acyl-PE; FAME, fatty acid methyl ester; PLC, phospholipase C; PLD, phospholipase D; DGK, diacylglycerol kinase; PAP, PA phosphatase; DNB, dinitrobenzoyl derivative; PKC, protein kinase C; DRG, diradylglycerol; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatograpy; GC-MS, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry; BSA, bovine serum albumin; HA, hemagglutinin The second messengers, 1,2-diacylglycerol (DAG) and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate are now well established as modulators of protein kinase C (PKC) activity and intracellular calcium ion concentration, respectively (1Michell R.H. Essays Biochem. 1997; 32: 31-47PubMed Google Scholar). In recent years, investigations have revealed that phospholipids distinct from phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) can also act as substrates for activated phospholipases. One of these is phosphatidylcholine (PC), the principal substrate for phospholipase D (PLD) which catalyzes its hydrolysis to form phosphatidic acid (PA) and free choline (2Exton J.H. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 303-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). The other route for the formation of PA is through the phosphorylation of DAG by DAG kinase (DGK) (3Sakane F. Kanoh H. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1998; 29: 1139-1143Crossref Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Structural analysis of precursor phospholipids and LSMs have demonstrated that phospholipid hydrolysis by activated phospholipases is not a random process, but rather is highly organized and selective for particular lipid classes leading to the formation of specific LSMs (4Pettitt T.R. Wakelam M.J.O. Biochem. J. 1993; 289: 487-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 5Pettitt T.R. Zaqqa M. Wakelam M.J.O. Biochem.

DAG and PA exist in biologically active and inactive forms depending on their fatty acid compositions. Biologically active DAGs are those which possess polyunsaturated fatty acids (i.e.those containing three or more double bonds) (6Pettitt T.R. Martin A. Horton T. Liossis C. Lord J.M. Wakelam M.J.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17354-17359Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 7Pettitt T.R. Wakelam M.J.O. FEBS Lett. 1998; 427: 371-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation by DGK attenuates their activity, generating polyunsaturated PAs which are thought to be biologically inactive. In contrast, biologically active PAs are those containing saturated, monounsaturated, and to a lesser extent diunsaturated fatty acids (6Pettitt T.R. Martin A. Horton T. Liossis C. Lord J.M. Wakelam M.J.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17354-17359Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 8Cross M.J. Roberts S. Ridley A.J. Hodgkin M.N. Stewart A. Claesson-Welsh L. Wakelam M.J.O. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 588-597Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Dephosphorylation by PA phosphatase (PAP) switches off this PA signal by converting it to inactive, primarily monounsaturated, DAG (7Pettitt T.R. Wakelam M.J.O. FEBS Lett. 1998; 427: 371-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 9Hodgkin M.H. Pettitt T.R. Martin A. Michell R.H. Pemberton A.J. Wakelam M.J.O. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 200-204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). The conversion of biologically active DAGs and PAs into their inactive counterparts is important for the cessation of the incoming signal and for the resynthesis of their precursor phospholipids to maintain membrane integrity. As the interconversion between biologically active and inactive DAGs and PAs is through DGK and PAP this implies their generation through two distinct routes: via PLD for the generation of biologically active PA and via phospholipase C (PLC) for the generation of biologically active DAG. This model is supported by both the kinetics of accumulation of species-specific DAGs and PAs and additionally through the fatty acid analysis of their precursor phospholipids which show a close match to DAG and PA (4Pettitt T.R. Wakelam M.J.O. Biochem. J. 1993; 289: 487-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). From the information in the literature it has now become apparent that the generation of LSMs is a highly ordered sequence of events that displays a high degree of specificity (9Hodgkin M.H.

Sci. 1998; 23: 200-204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar).Interleukin-2 (IL-2) is the cytokine responsible for T-cell proliferation. After binding to its high affinity receptor on the cell surface, the activated receptor initiates a variety of signal transduction pathways of which those involving protein and lipid kinases have been the best characterized. IL-2 neither causes the hydrolysis of PIP2 nor provokes the generation of cyclic nucleotides as a means to generate second messenger molecules (10Mills G.B. Steward D.J. Mellors A. Gelfand E.W. J. Immunol. 1986; 136: 3019-3024PubMed Google Scholar, 11Tigges M.A. Casey L.S. Koshland M.E. Science. 1989; 243: 781-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 12Sawami H. Terada N. Franklin R.A. Okawa H. Uchiyama T. Lucas J.J. Gelfand E.W. J. Cell. Physiol. 1992; 151: 367-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). In contrast, a rapid elevation of PA levels is seen in T-lymphocytes (13Merida I. Pratt J.C. Gaulton G.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 9421-9425Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) due to the activation of DGK (14Merida I. Williamson P. Smith K. Gaulton G.N. DNA Cell Biol. 1993; 12: 473-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Further investigations revealed that this acute activation of DGK, specifically that of the DGKα isoform, was essential for subsequent cell cycle progression and in addition, DGKα was rapidly translocated to the perinuclear region of T-cells (15Flores I. Casaseca T. Martinez-A C. Kanoh H. Merida I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10334-10340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The increase in PA is thought to be entirely due to the activation of DGKα as no PLD activity at equivalent times is detected in IL-2-stimulated cells (16Jones D.R. Flores I. Diaz E. Martinez-A C. Merida I. FEBS Lett. 1998; 433: 23-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). These observations underline the importance of DGKα activation for the generation of biologically active PA species during T-cell proliferation and distinguish it from other signal transduction mechanisms.Our goal in this work was to identify the fatty acid composition of both basal and IL-2-elevated PA in CTLL-2 cells to demonstrate that despite the lack of IL-2-stimulatable PLD activity, IL-2 could generate biologically active PA species via DGKα instead. In addition, the molecular species analysis of the diradylglycerols (DRGs) (consisting of DAG, 1-O-alkyl-2-acylglycerol (AAG) and 1-O-alk-1′-enyl-2-acylglycerol (AEAG)) was determined in order to define the substrates for the IL-2-stimulated DGKα in CTLL-2 cells.RESULTSIn T-lymphocytes, IL-2 has been reported to both stimulate DGKα activity (14Merida I. Williamson P. Smith K. Gaulton G.N. DNA Cell Biol. 1993; 12: 473-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 15Flores I. Casaseca T. Martinez-A C. Kanoh H. Merida I. J. Biol.

A. 1990; 87: 9421-9425Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) at early time points (less than 30 min). To investigate the molecular species composition of this PA we initially analyzed its fatty acid content in resting CTLL-2 cells. Fatty acids identified as 14:0, 15:0, 16:0, 16:1n-7, 16:1n-5, 18:0, 18:1n-9, and 18:1n-7 were present in varying quantities (Fig.1). 16:0 represented over 80% of the total fatty acid found within the PA fraction, whereas 15:0 was the most minor component (less than 1% of total). No di- or more unsaturated fatty acids were found in CTLL-2 cell PA. IL-2-stimulation for 2 and 15 min caused the total amount of fatty acid in the PA fraction to rise to 141 and 204% of control, respectively, indicative of a rise in total PA mass. The monounsaturated fatty acids were found to increase above their respective control levels to a proportionately greater extent as compared with their saturated counterparts, although in total mass terms the saturates remained predominant (Fig. 1). The increase at 2 min was to 134% of control for total saturated fatty acids and 187% of control for total monounsaturated fatty acids, while at 15 min it was 177 and 364%, respectively. No new fatty acids appeared in the PA fraction after any IL-2 stimulation conditions.Since the IL-2 stimulated increase in PA at short times is thought to be entirely through the action of DGKα (15Flores I.

Merida I. FEBS Lett. 1998; 433: 23-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), yet the fatty acid composition of saturated and monounsaturated species was very similar to that seen in lysophosphophatidic acid-stimulated porcine aortic endothelial cells where the PA was generated by a PLD (6Pettitt T.R.

Chem. 1997; 272: 17354-17359Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar), we determined the DRG (DAG, AAG, and AEAG) composition of CTLL-2 cells. DAG represented 44% of the total DRG, AAG represented 55%, while AEAG accounted for the remaining 1–2%, under resting conditions. Molecular species analysis by reverse-phase HPLC revealed 16 major DAG peaks corresponding to distinct molecular species (Fig.2 A and TableI). 16:0/18:1n-9 (peak 11) was the most abundant species. The most abundant polyunsaturated species, 18:0/20:4n-6 (peak 8), was present as only 1% of total DAG. Reverse-phase HPLC of AAG demonstrated 10 major peaks (Fig. 2a), the most abundant being identified as 1-O-hexadecyl-2-oleoyl glycerol (1-O-16:0/18:1n-9; peak 8). Other AAG molecular species detected are listed in Table II. No polyunsaturated AAGs were detected. Although AEAG mass was too low for a full species analysis, transmethylation of total cellular DRG followed by GC-MS detected only 16 and 18 carbon-saturated dimethylacetyls derived from the corresponding alk-1′-enyl groups.Figure 2Reverse-phase HPLC separation of 1,2-DRG-DNB molecular species.

Open table in a new tab IL-2 stimulation caused no obvious changes in the DRG molecular species profiles, however, at 15 min, it did cause a small drop in total DAG mass (from 2498 ± 46 to 2245 ± 248 pmol/107cells) and a halving of total AAG mass (from 3059 ± 26 to 1416 ± 70 pmol/107 cells). Preincubation with the DGK inhibitor, R59949, blocked this IL-2-induced DRG response by approximately 90% (data not shown).The results of the molecular species analyses of DAG and AAG prompted us to reinvestigate the short-term IL-2-stimulated changes in PA. Since AAG represented approximately half of the total DRG in CTLL-2 cells, we envisaged that an alkyl, acyl structure could also be present in the PA fraction. By initially transmethylating PA and then trimethylsilylating the products we were able to identify, using GC-MS, both the component fatty acids and any alkyl ethers present. Fig.3 A shows the electron impact mass spectrum for 1-O-16:0 monoalkylglycerol following trimethylsilylation to 1-O-16:0, 2,3-bis-TMS glycerol. The C1-C2 bond within the 1-O-16:0, 2,3-bis-TMS glycerol is susceptible to cleavage and generates a major ion fragment atm/z 205 corresponding to [TMS-O-CH2= CH-O-TMS]+. The ions at m/z 73, 103, 117, and 147 correspond to various fragmentation and re-arrangement products tentatively identified as [TMS]+(or [(CH3)3Si]+), [TMS-O = CH2]+, [TMS-O-CH2 = CH2]+, and [(CH3)2Si = O-Si(CH3)3]+, respectively. No molecular ion could be detected. As the ion atm/z 205 could only arise from the decomposition of the 1-O-alkyl-2,3-bis-TMS glycerol we used this to quantify the alkyl, acyl content of PA.Figure 3IL-2-stimulated formation of AAG-PA . Panel A, electron impact-mass spectrum of 1-O-hexadecyl-2,3-bis-TMS glycerol. Inset shows the cleavage producing the characteristic m/z 205 ion.Panel B, arrested CTLL-2 cells were incubated ± IL-2 (500 units/ml) for the times indicated. PA was isolated by HPLC, transmethylated, the 1-O-alkylglycerols formed were then trimethylsilylated to form the corresponding 1-O-alkyl-2,3-bis-TMS glycerols before analysis by GC-MS using selected ion monitoring at m/z 73, 103, 117, 147, and 205. The 205 ion was used to quantify changes in 1-O-alkyl-2-acyl-PA mass in response to IL-2. The data are represented as mean ± S.D. (n = 3).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)In resting cells, 1-O-alkyl-2-acyl-PA (AAG-PA) represented over 50% of total PA and consisted of a mixture of 1-O-14:0, 1-O-16:0, 1-O-18:0, and 1-O-18:1 alkyl structures based on retention times relative to an authentic standard (data not shown). 1-O-16:0 was the predominant form, representing approximately one-third of the total AAG-PA. IL-2 stimulation for 2 and 15 min increased the level of AAG-PA by 2- and 4-fold, respectively (Fig. 3 B). At 15 min almost all the PA is of the AAG-PA form since there is approximately a 1:1 ratio of total fatty acid to alkyl groups at this time point (Figs. 1and 3 B). The increases in AAG-PA are similar to those for the monounsaturated fatty acids (Fig. 1) suggesting that DGKα may preferentially phosphorylate AAG containing unsaturated acyl chains when available.When the CTLL-2 PC molecular profile was analyzed following PLC hydrolysis and DNB derivatization, 16:0/18:1n-9 PC and 1-O-16:0/18:1n-9 PC were found to be the most abundant species (data not shown). The whole profile was similar to that for DRG, suggesting PC as a possible source of DRG. We decided to investigate this possibility by radiolabeling CTLL-2 cells with 1-O-[3H]octadecyl lysophosphatidylcholine which is rapidly and specifically incorporated into the AAG-PC and AAG-PE phospholipid fractions (87 and 12% of total radioactivity incorporated, respectively). In addition, we found a minor proportion (approximately 1%) of the radiolabel associated with the AAG fraction of CTLL-2 cells. Over a time course of 0–30 min, IL-2 did not affect the radioactivity associated with AAG-PC, AAG-PE, nor AAG (Fig.4 and data not shown), suggesting that hydrolysis of AAG-PC and AAG-PE was not taking place in order to generate AAG. Another route for the generation of DRG is that throughde novo synthesis. To assess if IL-2 increased the de novo synthesis of DRG, we measured the incorporation of radioactivity from [9,10-3H]oleic acid into the DRG fraction in CTLL-2 cells. IL-2 treatment of CTLL-2 cells did not cause an increase in the incorporation of oleic acid (over a period of 30 s to 2 h) compared with control cell treatment (data not shown). We also measured the incorporation ofd-[U-14C]glucose into DRG, triacylglycerol, PA, PC, and PE in control- and IL-2-stimulated CTLL-2 cells. When radioactivity from a glucose tracer was determined in the glycerol backbone of DRG (which incorporated by far the greatest proportion of radioactivity at the end of a 4-min period of lineard-[U-14C]glucose uptake) from cells acutely treated with IL-2, there was no increase with respect to control-treated cells confirming that IL-2 did not affect de novo synthesis (Table III). In addition, we found that IL-2 did not increase de novosynthesis of triacylglycerol nor of PE. Very small changes (less than 10%) in the de novo synthesis of PC and PA were observed after treatment of the cells with IL-2 compared with control medium. However, these were not sufficient to alter the value of the estimated flux (the sum of DRG, triacylglycerol, PC, and PE (19Martin A. Duffy P.A. Liossis C. Gomez-Muñoz A. O'Brien L. Stone J.C.

In order to complement the results of the in vivo AAG-PA generation, we tested the ability of DGKα to phosphorylate DAG and AAG in vitro. COS cells were either transfected with an empty plasmid or a plasmid containing HA-tagged murine DGKα. The DGKα was immunoprecipitated through its tag. Only those cells transfected with the HA-tagged DGKα expressed the protein of approximately 80 kDa as determined by Western blotting (Fig.5 A). DGKα immunoprecipitates were preincubated with or without R59949 before incubation with the substrates, 1-O-16:0/18:1n-9 (AAG) or 16:0/18:1n-9 (DAG), in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP. Fig. 5 B shows that the HA-tagged murine DGKα was able to phosphorylate both the AAG and DAG substrates to the same extent. This enzymatic activity was inhibited by over 90% by preincubation of the immunoprecipitates with the DGK inhibitor II, R59949.Figure 5Expression and in vitroactivity of murine DGK α. COS cells were transfected with either an empty plasmid or a plasmid containing HA-tagged murine DGKα. Panel A shows that only cells transfected with a plasmid for HA-tagged murine DGKα (molecular mass approximately 80 kDa) expressed this protein as revealed by Western blotting. HA-tagged DGKα was immunoprecipitated from transfected cells then kinase activity was assessed using AAG and DAG as substrates with or without preincubation with the specific DGK inhibitor II R59949. The resultant [32P]PA was separated by TLC and detected by autoradiography (Panel B). R59949-mediated DGKα inhibition of the phosphorylation of DAG and AAG was calculated to be approximately 95 and 91%, respectively (averaged from two independent experiments).

By reference to the molecular structure of precursor phospholipids (such as PC and PIP2), the DRG and PA species formed may be mapped to their appropriate sources thereby fully characterizing a signaling pathway. At present, there exists a limited amount of information on this subject, but together it forms a model describing the formation and clearance of the LSMs DRG and PA through the tight regulation of at least the four enzymes: PLC, PLD, DGK, and PAP. These appear to function in many, but not all, signal transduction events delivered by mitogens (9Hodgkin M.H. Pettitt T.R. Martin A. Michell R.H. Pemberton A.J. Wakelam M.J.O. Trends Biochem.

The bloodstream trypanosome clone MVAT4 of Trypanosoma brucei rhodesienseexpresses a metacyclic vsg as a monocistronic RNA from a promoter located 2 kilobases (kb) upstream of its start codon. Determination of 23 kb of sequence at the metacyclic variant antigen type 4 (MVAT) vsg expression site (ES) revealed an ES-associated gene (esag) 1 preceded by an ingiretroposon and an inverted region containing an unrelatedvsg, short stretches of 70-bp repeats and a pseudoesag 3. Nuclear run-on experiments indicate that the 18-kb region upstream of the MVAT4 vsg promoter is transcriptionally silent. However, multiple members of differentesag families are expressed from elsewhere in the genome. The MVAT4 vsg promoter is highly repressed in the procyclic stage, in contrast to the known polycistronic vsg ESs which undergo abortive transcription. Activation of the MVAT4 vsgES occurs in situ without nucleotide sequence changes, although this monocistronic ES undergoes a pattern of base J modifications similar to that reported for the polycistronic ESs. The relative simplicity of the MVAT4 vsg ES and the uncoupled expression of the vsg and esags provide a unique opportunity for investigating the molecular mechanisms responsible for antigenic variation in African trypanosomes.

Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense, which causes sleeping sickness in humans, is a subspecies of the flagellated parasitic protozoa commonly called African trypanosomes. These unicellular organisms survive in the hostile bloodstream environment of their host by periodically changing their protein coats, a process called antigenic variation. Each protein coat covers the entire outer surface of the parasite and is composed of about 107 copies of a unique variant surface glycoprotein (VSG). 1The abbreviations used are: VSG, variant surface glycoprotein; vsg , VSG gene; MVAT, metacyclic variant antigen type; ES, vsgexpression site; esag , expression site-associated gene; ESAG, protein encoded by anesag ; ingi , a T. brucei retroposon; ORF, open reading frame; bp, base pair(s); kb, kilobase(s)1The abbreviations used are: VSG, variant surface glycoprotein; vsg , VSG gene; MVAT, metacyclic variant antigen type; ES, vsgexpression site; esag , expression site-associated gene; ESAG, protein encoded by anesag ; ingi , a T. brucei retroposon; ORF, open reading frame; bp, base pair(s); kb, kilobase(s) Although thevsgs are immunogenic during an infection, by the time antibodies against a particular VSG are raised by the host immune system, a subpopulation of the parasites expressing a new VSG has appeared. Thus, the infection is prolonged and the parasite population as a whole manages to keep “one step ahead” of the host's immune response (for recent reviews, see Refs. 1Pays E. Nolan D.P. Mol. Biochem.

The life cycle of T. brucei alternates between a mammalian host and its transmission vector, the tsetse fly vector (9Vickerman K. Br. Med. Bull. 1985; 41: 105-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar, 10Vickerman K. Tetley L. Hendry K.A. Turner C.M. Biol. Cell. 1988; 64: 109-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). In the bloodstream of the mammalian host, each parasite expresses one of about 1000 VGS genes (vsg) (11Van der Ploeg L.H.T. Valerio D. de Lange T. Bernards A. Borst P. Grosveld F.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1982; 10: 5905-5923Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). After a tsetse fly takes a blood meal from an infected animal, the ingested parasites differentiate into non-infective procyclic forms in the midgut of the fly and their VSG coats are replaced with an invariant glycoprotein coat composed of procyclins or procyclic acidic repetitive proteins (reviewed in Ref.12Roditi I. Furger A. Ruepp S. Schurch N. Butikofer P. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1998; 91: 117-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). After about 3 weeks, the parasites migrate to the fly's salivary glands, differentiate into highly infective, non-dividing metacyclic forms, and re-acquire a VSG coat. At this metacyclic stage, only one of about 15–20 different vsgs can be expressed (13Tetley L. Turner C.M. Barry J.D. Crowe J.S. Vickerman K. J. Cell Sci. 1987; 87: 363-372PubMed Google Scholar, 14Turner C.M. Barry J.D. Maudlin I. Vickerman K. Parasitology. 1988; 97: 269-276Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Late in a bloodstream infection, these metacyclic variant antigen type (MVAT) vsgs can occasionally be re-expressed in the bloodstream parasites (2Donelson J.E. Hill K.L. El-Sayed N.M. Mol. Biochem.

Although the vsgs are scattered throughout the T. brucei genome, all expressed vsgs studied to date are located near the telomeres. These telomere-linked vsgexpression sites (ES) are defined here to include the sequences that extend from the regions immediately upstream of the vsgpromoters to the subtelomeric/telomeric repeats located downstream of the vsgs, i.e. the sequences encoding the primary transcription unit and its immediate flanking regions that might influence transcription initiation and termination. Only a few bloodstream vsg ESs have been examined in detail, and the conventional model of an ES is based primarily on a detailed characterization of one such locus, the ES for the AnTat 1.3Avsg (18Lips S. Revelard P. Pays E. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1993; 62: 135-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). This bloodstream ES, and the few others that have been examined, contain a polycistronic transcription unit spanning 45–60 kb. Upstream of the transcription unit is a promoter preceded by several kilobases of 50-bp repeats. Downstream of the promoter is a minimum of eight ES-associated genes (esag), several kilobases of a 70-bp repeat and the vsg, followed by the subtelomeric and telomeric repeats (1Pays E. Nolan D.P. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1998; 91: 3-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Hybridization data suggest that about 20 such bloodstream ESs occur in the T. brucei genome (19Cully D.F. Ip H.S. Cross G.A.M. Cell. 1985; 42: 173-182Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 20Zomerdijk J.C.M.B. Ouellette M. ten Asbroek A.L.M.A. Kieft R. Bommer A.M.M. Clayton C.E. Borst P.

Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 1991-1997Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Based on the limited characterization of several metacyclic vsg ESs (2Donelson J.E. Hill K.L. El-Sayed N.M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1998; 91: 51-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 23Barry J.D. Graham S.V. Fotheringham M. Graham V.S. Kobryn K. Wymer B. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1998; 91: 93-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), these metacyclic ESs differ in several respects from the bloodstream vsg ESs. They are organized as short (3–5 kb) monocistronic transcription units and generally lack all or most of the 50-bp repeats, 70-bp repeats, andesags of bloodstream ESs. Although the extent of overlap between the bloodstream and metacyclic ESs remains unclear, under normal circumstances only one ES is fully activated at a given time (3Borst P. Bitter W. Blundell P.A. Chaves I. Cross M. Gerrits H. Van Leeuwen F. McCulloch R. Taylor M. Rudenko G. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1998; 91: 67-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar,24Rudenko G. Chves I. Dirks-Mulder A. Borst P. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1998; 95: 97-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The vsgs are maneuvered into and out of the active ES by different molecular mechanisms (reviewed in Ref. 25Borst P. Rudenko G. Blundell P.A. Van Leeuwen F. Cross M.A. McCulloch R. Gerrits H. Chaves I.M.F. Behring. Inst. Mitt. 1997; 99: 1-15PubMed Google Scholar). The best studied switching strategy is gene conversion, or “duplicative transposition,” a process by which the active vsg is replaced with a duplicated copy of a non-active vsg. Since the vast majority of the vsgs are not at the telomeres (11Van der Ploeg L.H.T. Valerio D. de Lange T. Bernards A. Borst P. Grosveld F.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1982; 10: 5905-5923Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar), this mechanism appears to be the most common route for vsgswitching (26Rudenko G. McCulloch R. Dirks-Mulder A. Borst P. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1996; 80: 65-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Other switching mechanisms include the duplicative conversion of an entire telomere plus its adjacent vsg ES to another chromosomal end (telomere conversion), and reciprocal exchange of two telomeres and their associated vsgs (telomere exchange). In addition, transcription of one ES can switch to another ES in situ without any associated DNA rearrangements (in situ activation). Here we report a detailed analysis of the organization and transcriptional regulation of a monocistronic ES. The MVAT4 trypanosome clone of T.b. rhodesiense is a bloodstream form parasite that expresses a metacyclic vsg (16Alarcon C.M. Son H.J. Hall T. Donelson J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5579-5591Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). This vsg is a telomere-linked single copy gene that, in contrast to the other examined bloodstream-form vsgs, is transcribed as a monocistronic RNA from a proximal promoter located 2 kb upstream of its start codon. We cloned genomic DNA fragments encompassing the MVAT4vsg ES from parasites either expressing or not expressing the MVAT4 VSG and found this region to be highly conserved. The relative simplicity of this ES allowed us to examine two of the current models for the ES regulation, i.e. the abortive transcription model and the DNA base modification model. We found no evidence for abortive transcription but did identify a pattern of base modifications similar to that of polycistronic ESs. The Walter Reed Army Trypanozoon antigen type clone 1.1 (WRATat 1.1) was derived from a human isolate of T. brucei rhodesiense as described previously (27Campbell G.H. Esser K.M. Wellde B.T. Diggs C.L. Am. J. Trop. Med. Hyg. 1979; 28: 974-983Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) and is the progenitor of the other trypanosome clones used in this study. Bloodstream trypanosome clones re-expressing either the MVAT4 or MVAT7 VSG were derived from WRATat 1.1 as described (15Lu Y. Hall T. Gay L.S. Donelson J.E.

The isolation of nuclei from bloodstream and procyclic trypanosomes was performed according to a protocol kindly provided by Pays and colleagues (29Coquelet H. Tebabi P. Pays A. Steinert M. Pays E.

Biol. 1994; 14: 5579-5591Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The nuclei were divided into 50-μl aliquots and stored at −80 °C until used. Thawed aliquots of nuclei were incubated with 250 μCi of [α-32P]UTP at 28 °C for 20 min. RNAs were extracted with phenol-chloroform and purified on G50 QuickSpin columns (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The radiolabeled nascent transcripts were used as probes on Southern blots as described (16Alarcon C.M. Son H.J. Hall T. Donelson J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5579-5591Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). In some experiments, α-amanitin (200–500 μg/ml) was added to the reaction prior to incubation. In other experiments, trypanosomes were treated with UV irradiation prior to nuclei isolation as described (30Coquelet H. Steinert M. Pays E. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1991; 44: 33-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 31Johnson P.J. Kooter J.M. Borst P. Cell. 1987; 51: 273-281Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Genomic DNA and total RNA for use in Southern and Northern blots were isolated from trypanosomes as described previously (32Chirgwin J.M. Przbyla J.M. MacDonald R.J. Rutter W.J.

A bacteriophage λ FIX II library of partial Sau3A fragments from genomic DNA of WRATat 1.1 trypanosomes was constructed following the supplier's protocol for Gigapack II Gold kit (Stratagene). This library, a previously constructed library of genomic DNA from the MVAT4 bloodstream organisms, and an MVAT4 λ ZAP cDNA library were screened using standard protocols (34Sambrook J. Fritsch E. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Hybridization probes were labeled with32P using a random priming DNA labeling kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). In experiments testing for possible DNA modifications, a 10-fold excess of restriction enzymes (HindIII, PstI, and PvuII) was used to ensure complete digestion of DNAs (35Bernards A. van Harten-Loosbroek N. Borst P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 4153-4170Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 36Pays E. Delauw M.F. Laurent M. Steinert M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 5235-5247Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), and 10 μg of digested DNA was loaded per lane in agarose gels. DNA sequences in plasmid and phage clones were determined by a combination of dideoxy chain termination method using a Sequenase 2.0 kit (U. S. Biochemical Corp.) and automated sequencing using an ABI 737 sequencer (Perkin-Elmer). Sequences alignments were conducted using the HIBIO MacIntosh DNASIS program (Hitachi) and Lazergene software (DNA*Star). Previous screening of a λ FIX II library of genomic DNA derived from bloodstream MVAT4 trypanosomes resulted in identification of two overlapping phage clones, designated M4-g1 and -g2, that span the MVAT4 vsg ES (16Alarcon C.M. Son H.J. Hall T. Donelson J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5579-5591Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). To construct a detailed physical map of this ES in its active state, we subcloned and sequenced the DNA inserts in these clones. The resulting 23 kb of contiguous DNA sequence extends from 21 kb upstream of the MVAT4vsg to 290 bp downstream of its stop codon (Fig.1). It was previously shown that the promoter for the MVAT4 vsgis located 2 kb upstream of the gene's coding region, and that the start codon of an esag 1 occurs 3.9 kb further upstream of this promoter (16Alarcon C.M. Son H.J. Hall T. Donelson J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5579-5591Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). GenBank searches of the newly sequenced portion of the 23 kb revealed several additional sequence elements upstream of theesag 1: a 5.2-kb ingi retroposon (37Kimmel B.E. Ole-MoiYoi O.K. Young J.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 1465-1475Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 38Murphy N.B. Pays A. Tebabi P. Coquelet H. Guyaux M. Steinert M. Pays E. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 195: 855-871Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), a 1-kb open reading frame (ORF) with no significant homology to known sequences in the data bases, a 1.4-kb ORF (designated ILTat 1.23 (x)) whose deduced amino acid sequence is highly similar, but not identical, to the ILTat 1.23 VSG (39Carrington M. Miller N. Blum M. Roditi I. Wiley D. Turner M. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 221: 823-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), and a pseudo ESAG 3 gene (ψ esag 3) (40Alexandre S. Guyaux M. Murphy N.B. Coquelet H. Pays A. Steinert M. Pays E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 2367-2378Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). In addition, two small regions of 70-bp repeats, which are thought to be involved in recombination events of at least some vsgs (7Vanhamme L. Pays E. Microbiol. Rev. 1995; 59: 223-240Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,41Campbell D.A. van Bree M.P. Boothroyd J.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 2759-2774Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 42McCulloch R. Rudenko G. Borst P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 833-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), were found. One region containing 2½ repeat units of 70 bp is located 0.6 kb upstream of the 1-kb ORF, and a single 70-bp unit is located 0.4 kb upstream of ILTat 1.23 (x). Some of the previously studied ingi elements are flanked by short (<10 bp) direct repeats which apparently result from a duplication of the integration site (37Kimmel B.E. Ole-MoiYoi O.K. Young J.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 1465-1475Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 38Murphy N.B. Pays A. Tebabi P. Coquelet H. Guyaux M. Steinert M. Pays E. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 195: 855-871Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 43Rogers J.H. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1985; 93: 187-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). The ingishown in Fig. 1 is not flanked by any repeats. However, the 8.5-kb region upstream of the ingi appears to have been inverted. All of the sequences from this region that match sequences in the data bases are in a reverse orientation compared with that of theingi and its downstream region including the MVAT4vsg. A somewhat similar observation has been reported by Vassella et al. (44Vassella E. Roditi I. Braun R. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1996; 82: 131-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) where an apparent integration of aningi into the basic copy of an expressed vsgresulted in a hybrid transcript composed of the ingi sense strand preceded by the vsg antisense strand. A polymerase chain reaction fragment corresponding to the 1-kb unidentified ORF upstream of the ingi (probe C, Fig. 1) was used as a probe in Northern blots of total RNAs from the bloodstream MVAT4, MVAT7, and WRATat 1.1 trypanosomes but did not detect the presence of a corresponding RNA. When the same blots were stripped and reprobed for the MVAT4 VSG and histone H4 RNAs as controls, the expected signals were readily detected (not shown). In addition, no positive clones were identified when the same probe was used to screen about 100,000 clones in a bloodstream MVAT4 cDNA library. Thus, if an mRNA of this region occurs, it is too rare to be detected by these techniques. The discovery of a second VSG gene, ILTat 1.23 (x), in this region was unexpected. When 1500 randomly picked expressed sequence tag clones from an MVAT4 cDNA library were sequenced, 3 different expressed sequence tags were found to contain ILTat 1.23 vsg-like sequences (45El-Sayed N.M. Alarcon C.M. Beck J.C. Sheffield V.C. Donelson J.E. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1995; 73: 75-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). However, an alignment of the nucleotide sequences showed that none of these expressed sequence tags were derived from theILTat 1.23 (x) near the MVAT4vsg ES. Consistent with this observation, Southern blot experiments indicated that ILTat 1.23-like sequences are present in multiple copies in the MVAT4 genome (not shown), and nuclear run-on assays showed that this ILTat 1.23 (x) is transcriptionally silent (see below). To determine if there are any sequence differences between the active and silent versions of the MVAT4 vsg ES, we first conducted an extensive Southern blot analysis of this region using genomic DNAs from the expressor trypanosomes (MVAT4) and two bloodstream trypanosomes, MVAT7, and WRATat 1.1, in which the MVAT4vsg ES is silent. The WRATat 1.1 trypanosome clone is the progenitor of the other two clones. Southern blot analysis of the region downstream of the esag 1 showed no differences between the active and silent ESs (data not shown), and confirmed earlier findings that this region is present in a single copy in all three genomes (16Alarcon C.M. Son H.J. Hall T. Donelson J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5579-5591Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Southern blot analyses of the region upstream of the ingi also did not show any differences among the three genomes. However, these blots did indicate that, in contrast to the region downstream of the esag 1, this 8.5-kb upstream region is present in multiple copies in all three genomes. One example of these Southern blots is shown in Fig. 2. Genomic DNAs from the MVAT4, MVAT7, and WRATat 1.1 trypanosomes were digested with BglII, HincII, PvuII, and XhoI, and probed with a 0.5-kb fragment corresponding to the extreme 5′ sequence in the physical map (probe A, Fig. 1). Because none of the four examined restriction sites occur within the probe fragment, these data indicate there are at least three similar copies of this upstream region in the MVAT4, MVAT7, and WRATat 1.1 genomes. Furthermore, the hybridization patterns for the BglII digestions suggest that this sequence similarity continues about an additional 10–15 kb upstream of the extreme 5′ region shown in Fig. 1. Similar blots probed with other fragments from this inverted 8.5-kb region indicated that these sequences or their homologues are also repeated at least three times in the genome, and in one case, ψesag 3, more than three times (not shown). These genomic Southern blots indicated there are no gross changes in the organization of the active and silent MVAT4 vsg ES. However, this analysis does not detect point changes or other small differences outside the restriction sites. Thus, we determined if there were any changes in the DNA sequence of this ES not detectable by Southern blot analysis. To examine the sequence of the MVAT4vsg ES in its silent state, a λ FIX II library of genomic DNA derived from WRATat 1.1 bloodstream trypanosomes was constructed. This genomic library was probed with a 1.6-kbAccI-SacI fragment containing the region upstream of the MVAT4 vsg and 130 bp of its coding region (probe E, Fig. 1). This screening resulted in identification of two overlapping phage clones, designated W1.1-g1 and -g2. End sequencing andNotI digestions of DNAs from these clones indicated that clone W1.1-g2 contains only one 13-kb NotI insert, whereas clone W1.1-g1 contains a 14.5-kb insert composed of 12- and 2.5-kbNotI fragments (Fig. 1). These NotI fragments were directly subcloned into pBluescript vectors and sequenced. A comparison of these sequences with the sequence derived previously from parasites expressing the MVAT4 vsg showed that, not only is the overall genomic organization of the region encompassing the MVAT4vsg ES the same in its active and silent states, but also that it is highly conserved at the level of nucleotide sequence. Only two single nucleotide changes from the previous sequence were detected in the 18-kb overlapping regions, one at nucleotide position 12,825 in clone W1.1-g2 and the other at nucleotide position 18,200 in clone W1.1-g1. These two differences are unlikely to bear any significance, especially since they are not conserved between the W1.1-g1 and -g2 clones, which are both derived from the same genome. Previous work from our laboratory showed that there is a gap in transcription between the vsg and the esag 1shown in Fig. 1. UV irradiation experiments suggested that theesag 1 is at the end of a large polycistronic precursor transcript, whereas the MVAT4 vsg is on a short transcript (16Alarcon C.M. Son H.J. Hall T. Donelson J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5579-5591Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Using subcloned fragments spanning the MVAT4 vsg ES, we further investigated these early findings and constructed a detailed transcription map for this ES. pBluescript subclones containing fragments spanning the MVAT4vsg ES were digested with appropriate restriction enzymes and used in nuclear run-on assays to map the transcribed regions (Figs.1 and 3 A, left panel). A comparison of the middle panel in Fig. 3 A with the three panels in Fig. 3 B shows that, except for the MVAT4 vsgtranscript, the transcription pattern of this region is the same in MVAT4 parasites and those expressing other VSGs or procyclin. Furthermore, these data indicate that both the esag 1(fragment b) and the region upstream of the ingi (fragment g) are transcriptionally silent (Fig. 3 A, middle panel). Upon re-examination of the earlier data (16Alarcon C.M. Son H.J. Hall T. Donelson J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5579-5591Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), we discovered that the DNA fragment which appeared to give rise to a transcription signal for the esag 1 contained 1.6 kb from the 3′ end of theingi element in addition to the esag 1 coding region. Therefore, the hybridization signal that originally appeared to represent transcription of esag 1 was in fact the result of the associated upstream ingi sequence. Further experiments confirmed this conclusion and prompted a more extensive study of the differential expression of the ESAG 1 gene family in this serodeme, which has been reported earlier (46Morgan R.W. El-Sayed N.M.A. Kepa J.K. Pedram M. Donelson J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9771-9777Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). This study showed that at least 20 different ESAG 1 genes are expressed in the bloodstream MVAT4 trypanosome clone, none of which is the esag 1 at the MVAT4vsg ES. The T. brucei genome contains as many as 400 copies ofingi (38Murphy N.B. Pays A. Tebabi P. Coquelet H. Guyaux M. Steinert M. Pays E. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 195: 855-871Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). It has been shown previously that ingiis highly transcribed from both strands (38Murphy N.B. Pays A. Tebabi P. Coquelet H. Guyaux M. Steinert M. Pays E. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 195: 855-871Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Since these transcripts are heterogeneous in size with the majority being greater than the 5.2-kb size of the element itself, they are thought to initiate from external upstream promoters (37Kimmel B.E. Ole-MoiYoi O.K. Young J.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 1465-1475Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 38Murphy N.B. Pays A. Tebabi P. Coquelet H. Guyaux M. Steinert M. Pays E. J. Mol.

In this study, immunocytochemistry indicated that endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-associated proteasome molecules were concentrated in perinuclear regions of digitonin-permeabilized HepG2 cells.

The mechanism of apoB degradation in the ER by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway was studied using pulse-chase labeling and digitonin-permeabilized cells. ApoB in permeabilized cells incubated at 37 °C in buffer alone was relatively stable. When permeabilized cells were incubated with both exogenous ATP and rabbit reticulocyte lysate (RRL) as a source of ubiquitin-proteasome factors, >50% of [3H]apoB was degraded in 30 min. The degradation of apoB in the intact ER of permeabilized cells was much more rapid than that of extracted [3H]apoB incubated with RRL and ATP in vitro. The degradation of apoB was reduced by clasto-lactacystin β-lactone, a potent proteasome inhibitor, and by ubiquitin K48R mutant protein, an inhibitor of polyubiquitination. ApoB in HepG2 cells was ubiquitinated, and polyubiquitination of apoB was stimulated by incubation of permeabilized cells with RRL. These results suggest that newly synthesized apoB in the ER is accessible to the cytoplasmic ubiquitin-proteasome pathway and that factors in RRL stimulate polyubiquitination of apoB, leading to rapid degradation of apoB in permeabilized cells.

Because apoB is largely located in the ER lumen, the precise mechanism of apoB degradation by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway has not been worked out. Recently, ER proteins have been shown to undergo retrograde transport from the ER to the cytosol for proteasomal degradation (9Bonifacino J.S. Weissman A.M. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev.

Because apoB is located primarily in the ER lumen, it also would require retrograde transport before proteasomal degradation. Recent reports have shown that apoB associates with an ER membrane translocon component, Sec61 (7Chen Y. Le Caherec F. Chuck S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11887-11894Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 18Mitchell D.M. Zhou M.Y. Pariyarath R. Wang H.X. Aitchison J.D. Ginsberg H.N. Fisher E.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14733-14738Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). ApoB has also been shown to associate with the cytosolic chaperone HSP70 and the ER chaperones calnexin, ERp72, GRP94, calreticulin, and BiP (5Fisher E.A. Zhou M. Mitchell D.M. Wu X. Omura S. Wang H.

Studies on the ubiquitination of target proteins and their subsequent recognition and degradation by the proteasome are difficult in intact cells and would be even more pronounced with the large apoB molecule (540 kDa). Therefore, to investigate the degradation of apoB in the ER by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, we have studied apoB degradation in digitonin-permeabilized pulse-labeled HepG2 cells utilizing rabbit reticulocyte lysate (RRL) as source of ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes and other factors involved in proteasomal degradation (21Hershko A. Heller H. Elias S. Ciechanover A. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 8206-8214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Ciehanover A. Hod Y. Hershko A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1978; 81: 1100-1105Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). The questions that we sought to answer are as follows. 1) How can newly synthesized apoB that is located largely in the ER lumen be degraded by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway in the cytosol? 2) Does newly synthesized apoB need to be transported to another location in the cell or are apoB and the proteasome in close proximity in the liver cell? This study demonstrates that cytosolic components in RRL are required for proteasomal apoB degradation in permeabilized cells with an intact ER membrane. Newly synthesized apoB in the ER is “primed” for rapid degradation by the proteasome, suggesting that efficient retrograde transport of apoB occurs in permeabilized cells. RRL was obtained from Promega (Madison, WI). ATP, creatine kinase, creatine phosphate, and bovine serum albumin were purchased from Sigma. l-[4,5-3H]Leucine and luminol reagent (ECL kit) were purchased from Nycomed Amersham (Princeton, NJ).

Protein A-Sepharose CL-4B was obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Minimal essential medium and leucine-free medium (minimal essential medium Selectamine kit) were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. Anti-mouse and anti-rabbit secondary antibodies conjugated with the fluorochrome Cy3 (indocarbocyanine) or Cy5 (indodicarbocyanine) were obtained from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc. (West Grove, PA). All other chemicals were of the highest purity available. HepG2 cells were grown on collagen-coated tissue culture dishes (for labeling experiments) or coverslips (for immunocytochemistry) as described previously (23Du X. Stoops J.D. Mertz J.R. Stanley C.M. Dixon J.L. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 585-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Briefly, HepG2 cells were cultured in 24- or 6-well tissue culture plates with complete medium containing minimal essential medium with 0.1 mmnonessential amino acids, 1.0 mm sodium pyruvate, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 10% fetal bovine serum. After 4 days of culture in a CO2 incubator, cells were used for pulse-chase experiments. For immunocytochemistry, HepG2 cells were used at lower confluency (20–30%). The cell permeabilization procedures were described previously (23Du X. Stoops J.D. Mertz J.R. Stanley C.M. Dixon J.L. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 585-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In this study, we used digitonin to perforate the plasma membrane and saponin to perforate both plasma and intracellular membranes. For permeabilization of cells with digitonin for immunocytochemistry, subconfluent HepG2 cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and treated for 5 min at 4 °C with digitonin (60 μg/ml) in intracellular buffer (75 mm potassium acetate, 2.5 mm magnesium acetate, 1.8 mm calcium chloride, and 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.2). After removing digitonin, the cells were washed three times with intracellular buffer and then fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde for 30 min at room temperature and processed for immunocytochemistry. For permeabilization of cells with saponin for immunocytochemistry, subconfluent cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde, washed three times with intracellular buffer, and processed for immunocytochemistry. All subsequent steps for saponin-permeabilized cells were performed in intracellular buffer containing 0.1% saponin and 0.1% bovine serum albumin. For permeabilization of cells with digitonin for apoB degradation studies, confluent HepG2 cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, treated for 5 min at 4 °C with digitonin (60 μg/ml) in intracellular buffer, washed three times with intracellular buffer, and used immediately. Digitonin- or saponin-permeabilized cells were incubated for 4 h or overnight with primary antibodies and then incubated for 4 h with the appropriate anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibodies conjugated with fluorochromes (Cy3 or Cy5) and examined with an MRC-600 confocal microscope (Bio-Rad) as described in detail by Du et al. (23Du X. Stoops J.D. Mertz J.R. Stanley C.M. Dixon J.L. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 585-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). HepG2 cells were preincubated with serum-free medium for 1 h and then pulsed with [3H]leucine (100 μCi/ml) in leucine-free medium for 10 min and chased for 10 min with serum-free medium at 37 °C. After labeling, cells were permeabilized with digitonin at 4 °C as described above and incubated at 37 °C with intracellular buffer (total of 250 μl/well) containing RRL (10–25 μl/well), 2 mm ATP, 100 μg/ml creatine kinase, and 10 mmcreatine phosphate. When effects of inhibitors were studied, cells were preincubated with intracellular buffer (250 μl/well) in the absence or presence of inhibitors for 20 min before incubation with RRL and ATP. The incubation buffer (intracellular buffer containing RRL) had also been treated with inhibitors for 20 min and then was added to inhibitor-pretreated permeabilized cells. After incubation, [3H]apoB in the cells was extracted with lysis buffer, immunoprecipitated, separated by SDS-PAGE, and detected by fluorography. Film images were scanned by an image scanner (Epson Expression 636) and analyzed by the NIH Image program (Version 1.61) on a Power Macintosh 9600 system (Apple Computer). The degradation of extracted [3H]apoB was monitored in vitro as described previously (24Sakata N. Dixon J.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1437: 71-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Briefly, HepG2 cells were pulsed with 75 μCi/ml [3H]leucine for 10 min and chased for 10 min. Newly synthesized [3H]apoB was isolated by immunoprecipitation using anti-human apoB antiserum and protein A-Sepharose CL-4B (3Dixon J.L. Furukawa S. Ginsberg H.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5080-5086Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Sakata N. Dixon J.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1437: 71-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar,25Furukawa S. Sakata N. Ginsberg H.N. Dixon J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22630-22638Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Extracted [3H]apoB (∼60,000 dpm/40 μl) in 0.1m glycine, 0.02 m Tris, and 1% Triton X-100, pH 7.4, was incubated with 45 μl of RRL, 2 mm ATP, 5 mm MgCl2, 100 μg/ml creatine kinase, and 10 mm creatine phosphate in a final volume of 90 μl. After incubation at 37 °C, 200 μl of electrophoresis sample buffer was added, and it was boiled for 4 min. Samples were separated by SDS-PAGE and visualized by fluorography. Unlabeled HepG2 cells were permeabilized with digitonin and incubated for 0 or 30 min at 37 °C in intracellular buffer plus rabbit reticulocyte lysate and ATP as described for the radiolabel studies. ApoB in cells was extracted with lysis buffer, immunoprecipitated with anti-human apoB antibody, and separated by SDS-PAGE. Proteins in the gel were transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride Immobilon-P membranes as described previously (23Du X. Stoops J.D. Mertz J.R. Stanley C.M. Dixon J.L. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 585-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). ApoB and apoB-bound ubiquitin in the membrane were detected by anti-apoB and anti-ubiquitin antibodies and visualized with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated second antibodies and ECL luminol reagent. Recent studies have indicated that the proteasome is largely located in the cytosol and that a small percentage of proteasome molecules are associated with the ER membrane (26Palmer A. Rivett A.J. Thomson S. Hendil K.B. Butcher G.W. Fuertes G. Knecht E. Biochem. J. 1996; 316: 401-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 27Rivett A.J. Palmer A. Knecht E. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1992; 40: 1165-1172Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). It is not clear whether ER membrane-associated proteasomes are involved in the degradation of ER proteins. To investigate this question, we first studied the locations of apoB and the proteasome in digitonin-permeabilized HepG2 cells using immunocytochemistry. In a previous study, two domains in apoB were shown to be exposed on the cytosolic side of the ER membrane in subconfluent streptolysin O-permeabilized HepG2 cells (23Du X. Stoops J.D. Mertz J.R. Stanley C.M. Dixon J.L. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 585-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In the current experiments, digitonin was used to permeabilize cells because only a maximum of ∼50% of the cells in confluent monolayers of HepG2 cells were permeabilized using streptolysin O, whereas almost 100% of the cells can be permeabilized with digitonin (data not shown). Two anti-apoB antibodies were used for immunocytochemistry. The CC3.4 antibody to apoB recognizes amino acids 690–797 in the N-terminal region of the apoB molecule (28Krul E.S. Kleinman Y. Kinoshita M. Pfleger B. Oida K. Law A. Scott J. Pease R. Schonfeld G. J. Lipid Res. 1988; 29: 937-947Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whereas the B4 anti-peptide antibody recognizes a more limited region of apoB (amino acids 3221–3240) (23Du X. Stoops J.D. Mertz J.R. Stanley C.M. Dixon J.L. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 585-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Although these regions of apoB were shown to be cytosol-facing, a majority of each apoB molecule is located in the lumen of the ER (23Du X. Stoops J.D. Mertz J.R. Stanley C.M. Dixon J.L. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 585-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Both apoB antibodies (CC3.4 (Fig.1 A) and B4 (Fig. 1,D and G)) produced bright concentrated staining in the perinuclear regions of cells, with less intense reticular staining in peripheral regions, as previously observed in streptolysin O-permeabilized cells (23Du X. Stoops J.D. Mertz J.R. Stanley C.M. Dixon J.L. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 585-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The 26 S proteasome is primarily a cytosolic protease (11Ciechanover A. Cell. 1994; 79: 13-21Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1600) Google Scholar, 12Weissman A.M. Immunol. Today. 1997; 18: 189-198Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) that consists of a large complex of proteins that compose a central 20 S core and two terminal PA700 complexes (29Baumeister W. Lupas A. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1997; 7: 273-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 30Coux O. Tanaka K. Goldberg A.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 801-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (2235) Google Scholar). We asked the question whether the proteasome would still be present in digitonin-permeabilized cells. For some experiments, cells were permeabilized first and then fixed for immunocytochemistry to allow removal of soluble cytosolic constituents (Fig. 1, A–C). When digitonin-permeabilized cells were probed with a polyclonal antibody to the 20 S proteasome α-subunit, bright signals were observed in the perinuclear regions of cells (Fig. 1 B). Monoclonal antibodies to the zeta (α-type) and HC10 (β-type) subunits of the proteasome (Fig. 1, E and H) gave similar signals in the perinuclear regions and more diffuse staining in the peripheral secretory membranes. These results indicate that a significant population of proteasome molecules remains associated with the ER membranes in the perinuclear regions of digitonin-permeabilized cells. When the signals due to the α-subunit of the proteasome were superimposed with the signals produced by the CC3.4 antibody to apoB (Fig. 1 C), there was significant overlap in the areas closest to the nucleus of the cell. There was also substantial overlap of signals from the zeta and HC10 subunits of the proteasome with the signals produced by the B4 region of apoB (Fig. 1, F andI). These immunocytochemical observations suggest that proteasome molecules that are associated with the ER may be in close proximity to cytosolic domains of apoB in the perinuclear regions of HepG2 cells. A series of biochemical experiments were performed to investigate the degradation of apoB in digitonin-permeabilized cells. Cells were cultured under standard media conditions without added fatty acid to mimic conditions that allow maximal early apoB degradation (3Dixon J.L. Furukawa S. Ginsberg H.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5080-5086Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). First, immunocytochemistry was used to determine whether the ER membrane was intact in digitonin-permeabilized cells (23Du X. Stoops J.D. Mertz J.R. Stanley C.M. Dixon J.L. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 585-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Whereas a bright signal for the luminal portion of the ER membrane protein p63 was observed when cells were permeabilized with saponin (Fig.2, right), only a background signal was observed in digitonin-treated cells (Fig. 2,left). These data indicated that ER membranes were not permeabilized by digitonin treatment. The degradation of apoB in permeabilized cells was measured as described under “Experimental Procedures” and shown in Fig.3. Digitonin treatment itself did not decrease the content of [3H]apoB in HepG2 cells (Fig.4 A, lanes 1 and2). When digitonin-permeabilized cells were incubated in buffer at 37 °C with no additions, [3H]apoB was observed to be relatively stable (Fig. 4 A, lane 3). This observation is similar to our early observation that apoB was stable in preparations of intact microsomes (25Furukawa S. Sakata N. Ginsberg H.N. Dixon J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22630-22638Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This result suggests that there is a requirement for cytosolic components for the degradation of apoB in permeabilized cells.Figure 4[3H]ApoB is degraded in permeabilized cells in the presence of RRL and ATP. A, HepG2 cells were pulsed with [3H]leucine for 10 min, chased for 10 min, permeabilized with 60 μg/ml digitonin for 5 min, washed with intracellular buffer, and incubated for 0 or 1 h with RRL and ATP at 37 °C. [3H]ApoB in the cells was extracted, immunoprecipitated, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE (3–15%).Lane 1, no digitonin treatment (control); lane 2, digitonin treatment only; lane 3, digitonin treatment plus incubation at 37 °C with buffer alone; lane 4, digitonin treatment plus incubation at 37 °C with RRL and ATP. Theasterisk denotes a 150-kDa apoB degradation product inlane 4. B, shown is the in vitrodegradation of extracted apoB. ApoB was isolated from HepG2 cells that had been pulse-labeled for 10 min with [3H]leucine and chased for 10 min with serum-free medium. [3H]ApoB was incubated with RRL and ATP at 37 °C for 0 or 3 h. [3H]ApoB was analyzed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Lane 1, no incubation (control); lane 2, incubation at 37 °C with buffer alone; lane 3, RRL added, but no incubation; lane 4, incubation at 37 °C with RRL and ATP. The mobilities of molecular mass markers and plasma low density lipoprotein are indicated to the right of each gel.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Previously, we utilized RRL to study apoB degradation in vitro (24Sakata N. Dixon J.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1437: 71-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) and observed that the degradation of isolated apoB was primarily dependent upon the ubiquitin-proteasome system present in RRL. Therefore, we added RRL to permeabilized cells to provide a source of the ubiquitin-proteasome system and other factors. Other additions (such as ATP) were made as noted in the figure legends. In contrast to permeabilized cells incubated in buffer alone, newly synthesized apoB was rapidly degraded in digitonin-permeabilized cells incubated at 37 °C in buffer containing RRL and the ATP-generating system (ATP) (Fig. 4 A, lane 4). ApoB degradation was not observed when permeabilized cells were treated with a preparation of boiled RRL, suggesting that the required factors were heat-sensitive (data not shown). As previously observed (24Sakata N. Dixon J.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1437: 71-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) when apoB was extracted from HepG2 cells and incubated with RRL and ATP, apoB degradation was dependent on RRL, but occurred at a much slower rate (Fig.4 B, lane 4). Approximately 75% of apoB was degraded after 3 h using the in vitro assay. A moderate size 150-kDa apoB degradation product (Fig. 4 A) and, in some experiments, a less prominent 380-kDa band (see Fig. 7 B) were observed in permeabilized cells treated with RRL, but were not produced in the in vitro assay (Fig. 4 B). A time course study indicated that newly synthesized apoB in permeabilized cells was degraded more rapidly than isolated apoB in thein vitro assay (Fig. 5). After 30 min of incubation, ∼70% of apoB was degraded in permeabilized cells versus only 25% in the in vitro assay. This difference in rate occurred despite the fact that less RRL was added to permeabilized cells compared with the amount of RRL added to the in vitro assay. To determine whether the loss of apoB signal was due to degradation of apoB or to release of apoB after ER membrane rupture, the effects of incubation with RRL on newly synthesized albumin were monitored in permeabilized cells. We previously showed that if secretory membranes are ruptured, albumin will be lost from permeabilized cells (23Du X. Stoops J.D. Mertz J.R. Stanley C.M. Dixon J.L. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 585-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Incubation of permeabilized cells for 30 min with RRL did not lead to loss of albumin signal (Fig.6). We also measured release of apoB into the incubation buffer. Only 2–3% of the total cellular apoB counts were immunoprecipitated from the incubation buffer regardless of the presence of RRL (data not shown). These results show that ER membranes remained impermeable during and after incubation of cells with RRL.Figure 6[3H]Albumin in permeabilized HepG2 cells is stable in the presence of RRL and ATP at 37 °C.HepG2 cells were labeled and permeabilized as described in the legend to Fig. 3. The permeabilized cells were incubated for 0 or 30 min with RRL and ATP at 37 °C. [3H]Albumin in the cells was extracted with lysis buffer, immunoprecipitated, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE (3–15%). Lane 1, digitonin treatment only;lane 2, digitonin treatment plus incubation at 37 °C with buffer alone; lane 3, digitonin treatment plus incubation at 37 °C with RRL and ATP.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The next series of experiments utilized inhibitors of the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway to determine whether the degradation of apoB in RRL-treated permeabilized cells was proteasomal in nature. ApoB degradation in permeabilized cells (Fig.7) was reduced by incubation with 50 μm clasto-lactacystin β-lactone, a potent inhibitor of the proteasome (31Dick L.R. Cruikshank A.A. Grenier L.

Schreiber S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8545-8548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). ApoB immunoprecipitated from cells treated with clasto-lactacystin β-lactone (Fig.7 A, lane 3) showed increased signals both for the main apoB band and for a higher molecular mass apoB species that may represent polyubiquitinated apoB (see Fig. 8). ApoB degradation was also inhibited by ubiquitin K48R mutant protein, which perturbs polyubiquitination of proteins (34Hochstrasser M. Ellison M.J. Chau V. Varshavsky A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 4606-4610Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 35Finley D. Sadis S. Monia B.P. Boucher P. Ecker D.J. Crooke S.T. Chau V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5501-5509Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). Incubation with 50 μm ubiquitin K48R mutant protein (Fig. 7 B,lane 3) produced an increased apoB signal without increasing the signal of the higher molecular mass apoB species that had been observed in Fig. 7 A (lane 3). This observation is consistent with inhibition of polyubiquitination of apoB by ubiquitin K48R mutant protein. In contrast to apoB degradation in the in vitro system (24Sakata N. Dixon J.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1437: 71-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), degradation of apoB in permeabilized cells was not significantly affected by ubiquitin aldehyde, an inhibitor of ubiquitin hydrolases (data not shown). Collectively, these results indicate that apoB degradation in RRL-treated permeabilized cells involves polyubiquitination, followed by efficient proteasomal proteolysis. Interestingly, there were only limited effects of the two inhibitors on the formation of the 150-kDa apoB degradation intermediate (Fig. 7), indicating that another process may be involved in the generation of this fragment. In the next experiment, we wished to examine the ubiquitination state and degradation of total cellular apoB in RRL-treated permeabilized cells (Fig. 8, A andB). As observed with [3H]apoB, apoB degradation could be observed by immunoblotting of digitonin-permeabilized cells after addition of RRL and ATP (Fig. 8 A, lane 3), but was not observed during incubation without RRL and ATP (lane 2). Immunoblots of immunoprecipitated apoB probed with anti-ubiquitin antibody showed that apoB in permeabilized cells was ubiquitinated prior to incubation with RRL (Fig. 8 B, lane 1). Despite loss of intact apoB (Fig. 8 A, lane 3), ubiquitinated apoB increased during incubation with RRL (Fig. 8 B, lane 3). The slower gel mobility of the signal produced by anti-ubiquitin antibody suggested that the ubiquitinated apoB formed during incubation with RRL was primarily polyubiquitinated apoB. When incubated without RRL, apoB appeared to become de-ubiquitinated (lane 2). These results indicate that a certain percentage of apoB is ubiquitinated in intact HepG2 cells and that, during incubation of RRL-treated permeabilized cells, ubiquitination of apoB is maintained or possibly increased, leading to the accumulation of polyubiquitinated apoB. In mammalian cells, a majority of the cellular proteasome was shown to be present in the cytosol (26Palmer A. Rivett A.J. Thomson S. Hendil K.B. Butcher G.W. Fuertes G. Knecht E. Biochem. J. 1996; 316: 401-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 27Rivett A.J. Palmer A. Knecht E. J. Histochem.

Immunogold electron microscopy studies indicated that 69–83% of proteasomes in rat hepatocytes were located in the cytoplasm, whereas the ER contained ∼11–14% of the gold particles (26Palmer A. Rivett A.J. Thomson S. Hendil K.B. Butcher G.W. Fuertes G. Knecht E. Biochem. J. 1996; 316: 401-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 27Rivett A.J. Palmer A. Knecht E. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1992; 40: 1165-1172Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). A study in yeast showed that proteasomal subunits labeled with green fluorescent protein accumulated mainly in the nuclear envelope-ER network (37Enenkel C. Lehmann A. Kloetzel P.M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6144-6154Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). We did not measure what percent of total cellular proteasomes is represented by the signals produced by anti-proteasome antibodies in our immunocytochemistry photographs. Whether the cells were permeabilized or fixed first, a large amount of soluble proteasome complexes may have been released into the washes during the permeabilization process. The results of this study provide evidence that populations of proteasomes are associated with the ER membrane and that they are located in regions of the cell that are important in the early metabolism of newly synthesized apoB. ApoB was relatively resistant to degradation in permeabilized cells incubated without RRL and ATP. Therefore, although the ER membrane still retained associated proteasomes, some other factor(s) appeared to be required for efficient degradation of apoB in permeabilized cells. We had previously used RRL as a source of ubiquitin-proteasome components in an in vitro apoB degradation assay (24Sakata N. Dixon J.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1437: 71-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). In the current study, after addition of RRL and ATP, [3H]apoB in intact ER membranes of permeabilized cells was degraded much more rapidly than extracted apoB that was not associated with secretory membranes (Fig. 5). The decline in apoB in permeabilized cells represents the degradation of a large fraction of newly synthesized apoB. Similar experiments in intact cells under lipid-poor conditions (3Dixon J.L. Furukawa S. Ginsberg H.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5080-5086Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Furukawa S. Sakata N. Ginsberg H.N. Dixon J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22630-22638Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) showed remarkably similar early apoB kinetics (0–30 min), but different later decay (> 30 min) due to the presence of a small, more degradation-resistant apoB pool in intact cells. Because only short pulse-chase periods were used in this study, the apoB degraded was primarily newly synthesized apoB. This pool of apoB in the membrane of the ER was primed for rapid degradation, but required cytosolic components. The degradation of apoB in permeabilized cells incubated with RRL and ATP was primarily by the ubiquitin-proteasome system, as it was reduced by both clasto-lactacystin β-lactone (Fig. 7 A) and ubiquitin K48R mutant protein (Fig. 7 B). ApoB in permeabilized cells became polyubiquitinated during incubation with RRL (Fig. 8). The results with ubiquitin aldehyde, which had minimal effects on apoB degradation in permeabilized cells, but had significant effects on the degradation of extracted apoB in the in vitrostudy (24Sakata N. Dixon J.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1437: 71-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), suggest either that de-ubiquitination of apoB is different in permeabilized cells or that the inhibitor does not have access to the ubiquitin hydrolases. These studies suggest that RRL provides one or more factors (additional proteasome complexes, ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes, or possibly a cytosolic chaperone) to permeabilized cells that are required for rapid proteasomal degradation of apoB. ApoB is one of an expanding group of proteins (misfolded, mutant, or overproduced membrane or secretory proteins) that may be transported from the ER lumen to the cytosolic side of the ER membrane for proteolysis by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. Recent reports showed ubiquitination of apoB (4Yeung S.J. Chen S.H. Chan L. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 13843-13848Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 5Fisher E.A. Zhou M. Mitchell D.M. Wu X.

These observations all suggest the involvement of the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway in apoB degradation (5Fisher E.A. Zhou M. Mitchell D.M. Wu X. Omura S. Wang H. Goldberg A.L. Ginsberg H.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20427-20434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Questions that remain are how does the primarily luminal apoB molecule gain access to the proteasome and what cell conditions or signals target apoB for degradation? A recent study reported that expression of cholesterol-7α-hydroxylase NADPH:oxygen oxidoreductase reduces proteasomal degradation of heterologous apolipoprotein B53 in Chinese hamster ovary cells by inhibiting ubiquitination (39Du E.Z. Fleming J.F. Wang S.-L. Spitsen G.M. Davis R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1856-1862Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). This may be a possible mechanism by which lipid metabolism influences early apoB degradation by the proteasome. The previous reports concerning apoB degradation in cells (4Yeung S.J. Chen S.H.

The mechanism of retro-transport of apoB is still unknown. Chenet al. (7Chen Y. Le Caherec F. Chuck S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11887-11894Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) and Mitchell et al. (18Mitchell D.M. Zhou M.Y. Pariyarath R. Wang H.X. Aitchison J.D. Ginsberg H.N. Fisher E.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14733-14738Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) recently showed that apoB co-immunoprecipitated with Sec61 and that treatments that slowed apoB-lipoprotein assembly increased this association. Because apoB is transported cotranslationally through the translocon, it was not determined whether the apoB found associated with Sec61 was being transported inward or outward. But the observation that the ubiquitination state of apoB associated with the Sec61 complex increased as proteasomal degradation of glycosylated apoB increased is evidence that retro-transport may occur through the translocon (7Chen Y. Le Caherec F. Chuck S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11887-11894Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Recently, we reported that two limited regions in apoB are exposed on the cytosolic side of the ER membrane (23Du X. Stoops J.D. Mertz J.R. Stanley C.M. Dixon J.L. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 585-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). It is possible that the CC3.4 and B4 domains of apoB play an important role in targeting poorly lipidated apoB molecules for proteasomal degradation. These domains may be used as attachment sites for proteins involved in apoB retro-transport. Zhou et al. (8Zhou M. Fisher E.A. Ginsberg H.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24649-24653Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) demonstrated that apoB is associated with HSP70, a cytosolic chaperone. It is intriguing to speculate that these cytosol-facing domains of apoB interact with HSP70 or ubiquitin. We also observed that a small portion of apoB degradation (the 150-kDa apoB fragment) was insensitive to ubiquitin-proteasome pathway inhibitors (Fig. 7). This apoB degradation peptide is not seen in intact cells and may be the result of another protease in RRL or a native protease in the ER of permeabilized cells that is activated by factors in RRL. A recent study showed that apoB was associated with an ER resident protease, ER60 (40Adeli K. Macri J. Mohammadi A. Kito M. Urade R. Cavallo D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22489-22494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). We reported that a dithiothreitol-sensitive protease in the ER might be partially involved in the degradation of apoB fragment (41Wu X. Sakata N. Lele K.M. Zhou M. Jiang H. Ginsberg H.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11575-11580Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). This study shows that ER membrane-bound proteasomes co-localize with cytosol-facing domains of apoB that may play a role in co-translational or post-translational apoB degradation (Fig.9). When lipid availability is inadequate, non-lipidated or poorly lipidated apoB is targeted for degradation by the proteasome. Proteasomal degradation of apoB in permeabilized cells may involve either ER-bound HepG2-derived proteasomes or RRL-derived proteasomes (Fig. 9). Studies investigating which population of proteasomes is responsible for apoB degradation and the factors in RRL that are required for degradation of apoB in permeabilized cells are now being conducted.
