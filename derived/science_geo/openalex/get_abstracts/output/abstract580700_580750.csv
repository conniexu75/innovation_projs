https://openalex.org/W2590741408,"One focus of modern astronomy is to detect temperate terrestrial exoplanets well-suited for atmospheric characterisation. A milestone was recently achieved with the detection of three Earth-sized planets transiting (i.e. passing in front of) a star just 8% the mass of the Sun 12 parsecs away. Indeed, the transiting configuration of these planets with the Jupiter-like size of their host star - named TRAPPIST-1 - makes possible in-depth studies of their atmospheric properties with current and future astronomical facilities. Here we report the results of an intensive photometric monitoring campaign of that star from the ground and with the Spitzer Space Telescope. Our observations reveal that at least seven planets with sizes and masses similar to the Earth revolve around TRAPPIST-1. The six inner planets form a near-resonant chain such that their orbital periods (1.51, 2.42, 4.04, 6.06, 9.21, 12.35 days) are near ratios of small integers. This architecture suggests that the planets formed farther from the star and migrated inward. The seven planets have equilibrium temperatures low enough to make possible liquid water on their surfaces."
https://openalex.org/W2590420622,"The robust analysis of neural signals is a challenging problem. Here, we contribute a convolutional neural network (CNN) for the robust classification of a steady-state visual evoked potentials (SSVEPs) paradigm. We measure electroencephalogram (EEG)-based SSVEPs for a brain-controlled exoskeleton under ambulatory conditions in which numerous artifacts may deteriorate decoding. The proposed CNN is shown to achieve reliable performance under these challenging conditions. To validate the proposed method, we have acquired an SSVEP dataset under two conditions: 1) a static environment, in a standing position while fixated into a lower-limb exoskeleton and 2) an ambulatory environment, walking along a test course wearing the exoskeleton (here, artifacts are most challenging). The proposed CNN is compared to a standard neural network and other state-of-the-art methods for SSVEP decoding (i.e., a canonical correlation analysis (CCA)-based classifier, a multivariate synchronization index (MSI), a CCA combined with k-nearest neighbors (CCA-KNN) classifier) in an offline analysis. We found highly encouraging SSVEP decoding results for the CNN architecture, surpassing those of other methods with classification rates of 99.28% and 94.03% in the static and ambulatory conditions, respectively. A subsequent analysis inspects the representation found by the CNN at each layer and can thus contribute to a better understanding of the CNN’s robust, accurate decoding abilities."
https://openalex.org/W2591015770,"The pacing of glacial-interglacial cycles during the Quaternary period (the past 2.6 million years) is attributed to astronomically driven changes in high-latitude insolation. However, it has not been clear how astronomical forcing translates into the observed sequence of interglacials. Here we show that before one million years ago interglacials occurred when the energy related to summer insolation exceeded a simple threshold, about every 41,000 years. Over the past one million years, fewer of these insolation peaks resulted in deglaciation (that is, more insolation peaks were 'skipped'), implying that the energy threshold for deglaciation had risen, which led to longer glacials. However, as a glacial lengthens, the energy needed for deglaciation decreases. A statistical model that combines these observations correctly predicts every complete deglaciation of the past million years and shows that the sequence of interglacials that has occurred is one of a small set of possibilities. The model accounts for the dominance of obliquity-paced glacial-interglacial cycles early in the Quaternary and for the change in their frequency about one million years ago. We propose that the appearance of larger ice sheets over the past million years was a consequence of an increase in the deglaciation threshold and in the number of skipped insolation peaks."

https://openalex.org/W2590551053,"A number scales have been developed to measure conspiracist ideation, but little attention has been paid to the factorial validity of these scales. We reassessed the psychometric properties of four widely-used scales, namely the Belief in Conspiracy Theories Inventory (BCTI), the Conspiracy Mentality Questionnaire (CMQ), the Generic Conspiracist Beliefs Scale (GCBS), and the One-Item Conspiracy Measure (OICM). Eight-hundred-and-three U.S. adults completed all measures, along with measures of endorsement of 9/11 and anti-vaccination conspiracy theories. Through both exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis, we found that only the BCTI had acceptable factorial validity. We failed to confirm the factor structures of the CMQ and the GBCS, suggesting these measures had poor factorial validity. Indices of convergent validity were acceptable for the BCTI, but weaker for the other measures. Based on these findings, we provide suggestions for the future refinement in the measurement of conspiracist ideation."

https://openalex.org/W2589136394,"Team Sports has been suggested as a suitable environment to investigate creative behavior. This study's purpose was two-fold: first, it intended to identify the effects of the Skills4Genius sports-bases training program in thinking, motor, and in-game creative behavior in team sports. Second, it aimed to investigate the relationship between creative thinking and in-game creativity. Forty children from primary school were allocated into control (n = 18, age: 9.2±0.4) and experimental (n = 22, age: 9.5±0.7) groups. The experimental group participated in a five-month training program involving either creative thinking, diversification, physical literacy, and nonlinear pedagogy approaches (Skills4Genius). Variables in the study included: a) creative thinking; b) motor performance (vertical jump, speed, and agility); c) in-game individual creative behavior (attempts, fluency, and versatility); and d) in-game collective behavior (positional regularity). The results suggested that the Skills4Genius program fostered creative thinking, agility, and speed performance. Moreover, it stretched the in-game individual creative behavior mainly through the improvement of the attempts and versatility of the player's actions. Lastly, it nurtured a better learning of the tactical principles, whereas the children were more coordinated with their teammates' and opponents' positioning. Additionally, this study presents a positive correlation linking creative thinking and in-game creative performance. These findings highlighted that creativity is facilitated while players become more thinking and game-skilled. Coaches and educators may apply this functional environment to inspire children's disposition to move outside the box and trigger a creative spark in team sports players. Notwithstanding, the sports environment is ideally suited for fostering creative behavior, a higher-order disposition that will go on to differentiate the everyday life of a child."
https://openalex.org/W2591312218,"The C-to-U deamination at position 32 of tRNAThr in Trypanosoma brucei requires two enzymatic activities and proceeds via formation of a 3-methylcytosine intermediate, supporting the notion of a coupled modification system. The array of modifications that can occur in DNA and RNA is much larger than is commonly appreciated, with more than 100 known modifications. However, few of these are easily replicated in vitro, leading to a proposal that coupling of modifications might be required. Juan Alfonzo and colleagues describe such a coupled system in the parasite Trypanosoma brucei. They find that the cytosine-to-uridine deamination at position 32 of tRNAThr requires two enzymatic activities, and proceeds via the formation of a 3-methylcytosine (m3C) intermediate. In addition, the presence of the m3C methyltransferase, TRM140a, limits the potentially mutagenic activity of the deaminase ADAT2/3. Nucleic acids undergo naturally occurring chemical modifications. Over 100 different modifications have been described and every position in the purine and pyrimidine bases can be modified; often the sugar is also modified1. Despite recent progress, the mechanism for the biosynthesis of most modifications is not fully understood, owing, in part, to the difficulty associated with reconstituting enzyme activity in vitro. Whereas some modifications can be efficiently formed with purified components, others may require more intricate pathways2. A model for modification interdependence, in which one modification is a prerequisite for another, potentially explains a major hindrance in reconstituting enzymatic activity in vitro3. This model was prompted by the earlier discovery of tRNA cytosine-to-uridine editing in eukaryotes, a reaction that has not been recapitulated in vitro and the mechanism of which remains unknown. Here we show that cytosine 32 in the anticodon loop of Trypanosoma brucei tRNAThr is methylated to 3-methylcytosine (m3C) as a pre-requisite for C-to-U deamination. Formation of m3C in vitro requires the presence of both the T. brucei m3C methyltransferase TRM140 and the deaminase ADAT2/3. Once formed, m3C is deaminated to 3-methyluridine (m3U) by the same set of enzymes. ADAT2/3 is a highly mutagenic enzyme4, but we also show that when co-expressed with the methyltransferase its mutagenicity is kept in check. This helps to explain how T. brucei escapes ‘wholesale deamination’5 of its genome while harbouring both enzymes in the nucleus. This observation has implications for the control of another mutagenic deaminase, human AID, and provides a rationale for its regulation."
https://openalex.org/W2589806221,"Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common arrhythmia and despite obvious clinical importance remains its pathogenesis only partially explained. A relation between inflammation and AF has been suggested by findings of increased inflammatory markers in AF patients.The goal of this study was to characterize morphologically and functionally CD45-positive inflammatory cell populations in atrial myocardium of patients with AF as compared to sinus rhythm (SR).We examined 46 subjects (19 with AF, and 27 in SR) undergoing coronary bypass or valve surgery. Peroperative bioptic samples of the left and the right atrial tissue were examined using immunohistochemistry.The number of CD3+ T-lymphocytes and CD68-KP1+ cells were elevated in the left atrial myocardium of patients with AF compared to those in SR. Immune cell infiltration of LA was related to the rhythm, but not to age, body size, LA size, mitral regurgitation grade, type of surgery, systemic markers of inflammation or presence of diabetes or hypertension. Most of CD68-KP1+ cells corresponded to dendritic cell population based on their morphology and immunoreactivity for DC-SIGN. The numbers of mast cells and CD20+ B-lymphocytes did not differ between AF and SR patients. No foci of inflammation were detected in any sample.An immunohistochemical analysis of samples from patients undergoing open heart surgery showed moderate and site-specific increase of inflammatory cells in the atrial myocardium of patients with AF compared to those in SR, with prevailing population of monocyte-macrophage lineage. These cells and their cytokine products may play a role in atrial remodeling and AF persistence."
https://openalex.org/W2590608006,"Climate-induced shifts in plant phenology may adversely affect animals that cannot or do not shift the timing of their reproductive cycle. The realized effect of potential trophic “mismatches” between a consumer and its food varies with the degree to which species rely on dietary income and stored capital. Large Arctic herbivores rely heavily on maternal capital to reproduce and give birth near the onset of the growing season but are they vulnerable to trophic mismatch? We evaluated the long-term changes in the temperatures and characteristics of the growing seasons (1970–2013), and compared growing conditions and dynamics of forage quality for caribou at peak parturition, peak lactation, and peak forage biomass, and plant senescence between two distinct time periods over 36 years (1977 and 2011–13). Despite advanced thaw dates (7−12 days earlier), increased growing season lengths (15−21 days longer), and consistent parturition dates, we found no decline in forage quality and therefore no evidence within this dataset for a trophic mismatch at peak parturition or peak lactation from 1977 to 2011–13. In Arctic ungulates that use stored capital for reproduction, reproductive demands are largely met by body stores deposited in the previous summer and autumn, which reduces potential adverse effects of any mismatch between food availability and timing of parturition. Climate-induced effects on forages growing in the summer and autumn ranges, however, do correspond with the demands of female caribou and their offspring to gain mass for the next reproductive cycle and winter. Therefore, we suggest the window of time to examine the match-mismatch framework in Arctic ungulates is not at parturition but in late summer-autumn, where the multiplier effects of small changes in forage quality are amplified by forage abundance, peak forage intake, and resultant mass gains in mother-offspring pairs."
https://openalex.org/W2590091929,"Phytoplankton, with an estimated 30 000 to 1 000 000 species clustered in 12 phyla, presents a high taxonomic and ecophysiological diversity, reflected by the complex distribution of pigments among the different algal classes. High performance liquid chromatography is the gold standard method for qualitative and quantitative analysis of phytoplankton pigments in seawater and culture samples, but only a few pigments can be used as robust chemotaxonomic markers. A major challenge is thus to identify new ones, characteristic of a strain, species, class or taxon that cannot be currently identified on the basis of its pigment signature. Using an optimized extraction process coupled to a HPLC de-replication strategy, we examined the pigment composition of 37 microalgae strains, representative of the broad taxonomic diversity of marine and freshwater species (excluding cyanobacteria). For each species, the major pigments already described were unambiguously identified. We also observed the presence of several minor unidentified pigments in each chromatogram. The global analysis of pigment compositions revealed a total of 124 pigments, including 98 pigments or derivatives unidentified using the standards. Absorption spectra indicated that 35 corresponded to chlorophyll/porphyrin derivatives, 57 to carotenoids and six to derivatives having both spectral signatures. Sixty-one of these unidentified or new carotenoids and porphyrin derivatives were characteristic of particular strains or species, indicating their possible use as highly specific chemotaxonomic markers capable of identifying one strain out of the 37 selected. We developed a graphical analysis using Gephi software to give a clear representation of pigment communities among the various phytoplankton strains, and to reveal strain-characteristic and shared pigments. This made it possible to reconstruct the taxonomic evolution of microalgae classes, on the basis of the conservation, loss, and/or appearance of pigments."
https://openalex.org/W2590776674,"Background High sugar and refined carbohydrate intake is associated with weight gain, increased incidence of diabetes and is linked with increased cardiovascular mortality. Reducing the health impact of poor quality carbohydrate intake is a public health priority. Reducose, a proprietary mulberry leaf extract (ME), may reduce blood glucose responses following dietary carbohydrate intake by reducing absorption of glucose from the gut. Methods A double-blind, randomised, repeat measure, phase 2 crossover design was used to study the glycaemic and insulinaemic response to one reference product and three test products at the Functional Food Centre, Oxford Brooks University, UK. Participants; 37 adults aged 19–59 years with a BMI ≥ 20kg/m2 and ≤ 30kg/m2. The objective was to determine the effect of three doses of mulberry-extract (Reducose) versus placebo on blood glucose and insulin responses when co-administered with 50g maltodextrin in normoglycaemic healthy adults. We also report the gastrointestinal tolerability of the mulberry extract. Results Thirty-seven participants completed the study: The difference in the positive Incremental Area Under the Curve (pIAUC) (glucose (mmol / L x h)) for half, normal and double dose ME compared with placebo was -6.1% (-18.2%, 5.9%; p = 0.316), -14.0% (-26.0%, -2.0%; p = 0.022) and -22.0% (-33.9%, -10.0%; p<0.001) respectively. The difference in the pIAUC (insulin (mIU / L x h)) for half, normal and double dose ME compared with placebo was -9.7% (-25.8%, 6.3%; p = 0.234), -23.8% (-39.9%, -7.8%; p = 0.004) and -24.7% (-40.8%, -8.6%; p = 0.003) respectively. There were no statistically significant differences between any of the 4 groups in the odds of experiencing one or more gastrointestinal symptoms (nausea, abdominal cramping, distension or flatulence). Conclusions Mulberry leaf extract significantly reduces total blood glucose rise after ingestion of maltodextrin over 120 minutes. The pattern of effect demonstrates a classical dose response curve with significant effects over placebo. Importantly, total insulin rises were also significantly suppressed over the same time-period. There were no statistically significant differences between any of the treatment groups (including placebo) in the odds of experiencing one or more gastrointestinal symptoms. Mulberry extract may have multiple modes of action and further studies are necessary to evaluate ME as a potential target for the prevention of type 2 diabetes and the regulation of dysglycaemia."

However, much less progress has been made on the structure of an equally important aspect of human psychology: motives. We present an empirically and theoretically structured hierarchical taxonomy of 161 motives gleaned from a literature review from McDougall to the present and based on the cluster analysis of similarity judgments among these 161 motives, a broader sampling of motives than previous work. At the broadest level were: Meaning, Communion, and Agency. These divided into nine clusters: Morality & Virtue, Religion & Spirituality, Self-Actualization, Avoidance, Social Relating, Family, Health, Mastery & Competence, and Financial & Occupational Success. Each divided into more concrete clusters to form 5 levels. We discuss contributions to research on motives, especially recent work on goal systems, and the aiding of communication and systematization of research. Finally, we compare the taxonomy to other motive organizations."
https://openalex.org/W2590294288,"Objective Early bonding by skin-to-skin contact (SSC) has been demonstrated to be beneficial for mothers and newborns following vaginal delivery. The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of intraoperative bonding (early SSC) after cesarean section on neonatal adaptation, maternal pain and stress response. Study design This prospective, randomized-controlled pilot study was performed at a single academic tertiary hospital (Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Medical University of Graz, Austria) between September 2013 and January 2014. Women were randomly assigned to intraoperative (“early”) SCC (n = 17) versus postoperative (“late”) SCC (n = 18). Main variables investigated were neonatal transition (Apgar score, arterial oxygen saturation, heart rate and temperature), maternal pain perception and both maternal and neonatal stress response by measuring the stress biomarkers salivary free cortisol and salivary alpha amylase. Results There was no evidence for differences in parameters reflecting neonatal transition or stress response between the ‘Early SSC Group’ and the ‘Late SSC Group’. Maternal salivary cortisol and alpha-amylase levels as well as maternal wellbeing and pain did not differ between the groups. However, the rise of maternal salivary alpha-amylase directly after delivery was higher in the ‘Early SSC Group’ compared to the ‘Late SSC Group’ (p = 0.004). Conclusions This study did not reveal significant risks for the newborn in terms of neonatal transition when early SSC is applied in the operating room. Maternal condition and stress marker levels did not differ either, although the rise of maternal salivary alpha-amylase directly after delivery was higher in the ‘Early SSC Group’ compared to the ‘Late SSC Group’, which may indicate a stressor sign due to intensive activation of the sympathetic-adreno-medullary-system. This needs to be further evaluated in a larger prospective randomized trial. Trial registration ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01894880"
https://openalex.org/W2590214733,"The transforming growth factor β isoforms, TGF-β1, -β2, and -β3, are small secreted homodimeric signaling proteins with essential roles in regulating the adaptive immune system and maintaining the extracellular matrix. However, dysregulation of the TGF-β pathway is responsible for promoting the progression of several human diseases, including cancer and fibrosis. Despite the known importance of TGF-βs in promoting disease progression, no inhibitors have been approved for use in humans. Herein, we describe an engineered TGF-β monomer, lacking the heel helix, a structural motif essential for binding the TGF-β type I receptor (TβRI) but dispensable for binding the other receptor required for TGF-β signaling, the TGF-β type II receptor (TβRII), as an alternative therapeutic modality for blocking TGF-β signaling in humans. As shown through binding studies and crystallography, the engineered monomer retained the same overall structure of native TGF-β monomers and bound TβRII in an identical manner. Cell-based luciferase assays showed that the engineered monomer functioned as a dominant negative to inhibit TGF-β signaling with a Ki of 20-70 nm Investigation of the mechanism showed that the high affinity of the engineered monomer for TβRII, coupled with its reduced ability to non-covalently dimerize and its inability to bind and recruit TβRI, enabled it to bind endogenous TβRII but prevented it from binding and recruiting TβRI to form a signaling complex. Such engineered monomers provide a new avenue to probe and manipulate TGF-β signaling and may inform similar modifications of other TGF-β family members."
https://openalex.org/W2589628019,"Genetic alterations conferring resistance to the effects of chemical inhibitors are valuable tools for validating on-target effects in cells. Unfortunately, for many therapeutic targets such alleles are not available. To address this issue, we evaluated whether CRISPR-Cas9-mediated insertion/deletion (indel) mutagenesis can produce drug-resistance alleles at endogenous loci. This method takes advantage of the heterogeneous in-frame alleles produced following Cas9-mediated DNA cleavage, which we show can generate rare alleles that confer resistance to the growth-arrest caused by chemical inhibitors. We used this approach to identify novel resistance alleles of two lysine methyltransferases, DOT1L and EZH2, which are each essential for the growth of MLL-fusion leukemia cells. We biochemically characterized the DOT1L mutation, showing that it is significantly more active than the wild-type enzyme. These findings validate the on-target anti-leukemia activities of existing DOT1L and EZH2 inhibitors and reveal a simple method for deriving drug-resistance alleles for novel targets, which may have utility during early stages of drug development."
https://openalex.org/W2589723988,"Mycoplasmas (a generic name for Mollicutes) are a predominant bacterial contaminant of cell culture and cell derived products including viruses. This prokaryote class is characterized by very small size and lack of a cell wall. Consequently, mycoplasmas escape ultrafiltration and visualization under routine microscopic examination, hence the ease with which cells in culture can be contaminated, with routinely more than 10% of cell lines being contaminated. Mycoplasma are a formidable threat both in fundamental research by perverting a whole range of cell properties and functions and in the pharmacological use of cells and cell derived products. Although many methods have been developed, there is still a need for a sensitive, universal assay. Here is reported the development and validation of a quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) based on the amplification of a 1.5 kb fragment covering the 16S rDNA of the Mollicute class by real-time PCR using universal U1 and U8 degenerate primers. The method includes the addition of a DNA loading probe to each sample to monitor DNA extraction and the absence of PCR inhibitors in the extracted DNA, a positive mycoplasma 16S rDNA traceable reference sample to exclude any accidental contamination of an unknown sample with this reference DNA, an analysis procedure based on the examination of the melting curve and the size of the PCR amplicon, followed by quantification of the number of 16S rDNA copies (with a lower limit of 19 copies) when relevant, and, if useful, the identification of the contaminating prokaryote by sequencing. The method was validated on a collection of mycoplasma strains and by testing over 100 samples of unknown contamination status including stocks of viruses requiring biosafety level 2, 3 or 4 containments. When compared to four established methods, the m16S_qPCR technique exhibits the highest sensitivity in detecting mycoplasma contamination."
https://openalex.org/W2589136237,"We studied a community of frugivorous Lepidoptera in the lowland rainforest of Papua New Guinea. Rearing revealed 122 species represented by 1,720 individuals from 326 woody plant species. Only fruits from 52% (171) of the plant species sampled were attacked. On average, Lepidoptera were reared from 1 in 89 fruits and a kilogram of fruit was attacked by 1.01 individuals. Host specificity of Lepidoptera was notably low: 69% (33) of species attacked plants from >1 family, 8% (4) fed on single family, 6% (3) on single genus and 17% (8) were monophagous. The average kilogram of fruits was infested by 0.81 individual from generalist species (defined here as feeding on >1 plant genus) and 0.07 individual from specialist species (feeding on a single host or congeneric hosts). Lepidoptera preferred smaller fruits with both smaller mesocarp and seeds. Large-seeded fruits with thin mesocarp tended to host specialist species whereas those with thick, fleshy mesocarp were often infested with both specialist and generalist species. The very low incidence of seed damage suggests that pre-dispersal seed predation by Lepidoptera does not play a major role in regulating plant populations via density-dependent mortality processes outlined by the Janzen-Connell hypothesis."

https://openalex.org/W2590597395,"Depression is a leading cause of HIV/AIDS disease burden; it worsens health outcomes and quality of life. Addressing this problem requires accurate quantification of the extra burden of depression to HIV/AIDS in a given population, and knowledge of the baseline depression prevalence in the general population. There has been no previous study of depression in the general Cameroonian population. The current study attempts to address that important need. We used the Beck Depression Inventory-II to assess the prevalence and severity of depressive symptoms in 270 HIV-infected and seronegative Cameroonians. Univariate analyses showed a trend toward higher depressive symptoms among cases, compared to controls (p = 0.055), and among older subjects (>40 years), compared to younger subjects (≤40 years) (p = 0.059). Analysis of depression severity showed that 33.73% of cases had moderate-to-severe depressive symptoms, compared to 19.8% of controls (p<0.01). However, multivariable negative binomial regression analyses showed no effect of age, HIV status, CD4 levels, viral loads, ART, or opportunistic infections on the risk of depressive symptoms. Both univariate and multivariable regression analyses showed significantly higher risk of depressive symptoms among females compared to males; this was significant for both female controls and female cases. Female cases had significantly higher CD4 cell counts and lower viral loads, compared to males. Both univariate and multivariable regression analyses showed that lower education (≤10 years) was associated with increased risk of depressive symptoms. This study shows a high prevalence of depressive symptoms among seronegative controls and HIV-infected Cameroonians. Integrating care for mental disorders such as depression into primary health care and existing HIV/AIDS treatment programs in Cameroon may improve the wellbeing of the general population and could lower the HIV/AIDS burden."
https://openalex.org/W2591463483,"Objective To determine whether a social cognitive theory (SCT)-based intervention improves resistance training (RT) maintenance and strength, and reduces prediabetes prevalence. Research design and methods Sedentary, overweight/obese (BMI: 25–39.9 kg/m2) adults aged 50–69 (N = 170) with prediabetes participated in the 15-month trial. Participants completed a supervised 3-month RT (2×/wk) phase and were randomly assigned (N = 159) to one of two 6-month maintenance conditions: SCT or standard care. Participants continued RT at a self-selected facility. The final 6-month period involved no contact. Assessments occurred at baseline and months 3, 9, and 15. The SCT faded-contact intervention consisted of nine tailored transition (i.e., supervised training to training alone) and nine follow-up sessions. Standard care involved six generic follow-up sessions. Primary outcomes were prevalence of normoglycemia and muscular strength. Results The retention rate was 76%. Four serious adverse events were reported. After 3 months of RT, 34% of participants were no longer prediabetic. This prevalence of normoglycemia was maintained through month 15 (30%), with no group difference. There was an 18% increase in the odds of being normoglycemic for each % increase in fat-free mass. Increases in muscular strength were evident at month 3 and maintained through month 15 (P<0.001), which represented improvements of 21% and 14% for chest and leg press, respectively. Results did not demonstrate a greater reduction in prediabetes prevalence in the SCT condition. Conclusions Resistance training is an effective, maintainable strategy for reducing prediabetes prevalence and increasing muscular strength. Future research which promotes RT initiation and maintenance in clinical and community settings is warranted. Trial Registration ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01112709."
https://openalex.org/W2591010726,"Background Bilirubin has been reported to protect against kidney injury. However, further studies highlighting the beneficial effects of bilirubin on renal fibrosis and chronic renal function decline are necessary. Methods We assessed a prospective cohort with a reference range of total bilirubin levels. The primary outcome was a 30% reduction in the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) from baseline, and the secondary outcome was a doubling of the serum creatinine levels, halving of the eGFR and the initiation of dialysis. In addition, experiments with tubular epithelial cells and C57BL/6 mice were performed to investigate the protective effects of bilirubin on kidney fibrosis. Results As a result, 1,080 patients were included in the study cohort. The study group with relative hyperbilirubinemia (total bilirubin 0.8–1.2 mg/dL) showed a better prognosis in terms of the primary outcome (adjusted hazard ratio (HR) 0.33, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.19–0.59, P < 0.001) and the secondary outcome (adjusted HR 0.20, 95% CI 0.05 to 0.71, P = 0.01) than that of the control group. Moreover, the bilirubin-treated mice showed less fibrosis in the unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO) model (P < 0.05). In addition, bilirubin treatment decreased fibronectin expression in tubular epithelial cells in a dose-dependent manner (P < 0.05). Conclusions Mildly elevated serum bilirubin levels were associated with better renal prognosis, and bilirubin treatment induced a beneficial effect on renal fibrosis. Therefore, bilirubin could be a potential therapeutic target to delay fibrosis-related kidney disease progression."
https://openalex.org/W2591457980,"Helicases play a critical role in processes such as replication or recombination by unwinding double-stranded DNA; mutations of these genes can therefore have devastating biological consequences. In humans, mutations in genes of three members of the RecQ family helicases (blm, wrn, and recq4) give rise to three strikingly distinctive clinical phenotypes: Bloom syndrome, Werner syndrome, and Rothmund-Thomson syndrome, respectively. However, the molecular basis for these varying phenotypic outcomes is unclear, in part because a full mechanistic description of helicase activity is lacking. Because the helicase core domains are highly conserved, it has been postulated that functional differences among family members might be explained by significant differences in the N-terminal domains, but these domains are poorly characterized. To help fill this gap, we now describe bioinformatics, biochemical, and structural data for three vertebrate BLM proteins. We pair high resolution crystal structures with SAXS analysis to describe an internal, highly conserved sequence we term the dimerization helical bundle in N-terminal domain (DHBN). We show that, despite the N-terminal domain being loosely structured and potentially lacking a defined three-dimensional structure in general, the DHBN exists as a dimeric structure required for higher order oligomer assembly. Interestingly, the unwinding amplitude and rate decrease as BLM is assembled from dimer into hexamer, and also, the stable DHBN dimer can be dissociated upon ATP hydrolysis. Thus, the structural and biochemical characterizations of N-terminal domains will provide new insights into how the N-terminal domain affects the structural and functional organization of the full BLM molecule.

However, the molecular basis for these varying phenotypic outcomes is unclear, in part because a full mechanistic description of helicase activity is lacking. Because the helicase core domains are highly conserved, it has been postulated that functional differences among family members might be explained by significant differences in the N-terminal domains, but these domains are poorly characterized. To help fill this gap, we now describe bioinformatics, biochemical, and structural data for three vertebrate BLM proteins. We pair high resolution crystal structures with SAXS analysis to describe an internal, highly conserved sequence we term the dimerization helical bundle in N-terminal domain (DHBN). We show that, despite the N-terminal domain being loosely structured and potentially lacking a defined three-dimensional structure in general, the DHBN exists as a dimeric structure required for higher order oligomer assembly. Interestingly, the unwinding amplitude and rate decrease as BLM is assembled from dimer into hexamer, and also, the stable DHBN dimer can be dissociated upon ATP hydrolysis. Thus, the structural and biochemical characterizations of N-terminal domains will provide new insights into how the N-terminal domain affects the structural and functional organization of the full BLM molecule. Helicases are the ubiquitous enzymes that unwind double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) into single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) during cellular processes, such as replication, transcription, or repair (1Singleton M.R.

RecQ family helicases, which are named after the recQ gene of E. coli, play essential roles in preserving genome stability from bacteria to higher eukaryotes, especially in DNA damage response and repair processes (3Khakhar R.R.

There are five dominant RecQ family members in humans: BLM, WRN, and RecQ4, along with RecQ1 and RecQ5. Mutations in the former three proteins lead to high genomic instabilities and cause Bloom syndrome (BS), 3The abbreviations used are: BSBloom syndromeRQCRecQ C-terminal domainHRDChelicase and RNase D C-terminal domainDHBNdimerization helical bundle in N-terminal domainhBLMgBLM, and pBLM, H. sapiens, G. gallus, and P. crispus BLM, respectivelyDLSdynamic light scatteringSAXSsmall angle X-ray scatteringr.m.s.d.root mean square deviationtNCStranslational non-crystallographic symmetrySADsingle-wavelength anomalous dispersionSeMetselenomethionineFfluoresceinHFhexachlorofluoresceinPDBProtein Data BankAMPNPβ,γ-imidoadenosine 5′-triphosphateATPrSadenosine 5′-(3-thiotriphosphate).

The BLM helicase core is flanked by ancillary N- and C-terminal domains (Fig. 1A). Sequence alignment analysis reveals that three regions are highly conserved in the helicase core and can be identified in most bacterial and eukaryotic RecQ proteins: the helicase domain, the RecQ carboxyl-terminal (RQC) domain, and the Helicase and RNase D C-terminal domain (HRDC) (8Killoran M.P.

RecQ helicases; at the crossroad of genome replication, repair, and recombination.Mol. Biol. Rep. 2012; 39: 4527-4543Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The helicase domain is essential for ATP binding and hydrolysis and defines the RecQ family. The RQC domain is also restricted to RecQ family members and is considered important for both the structural integrity of the protein and dsDNA binding; it might also have a role in mediating interactions with other proteins (10Vindigni A. Marino F. Gileadi O. Probing the structural basis of RecQ helicase function.Biophys. Chem. 2010; 149: 67-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 11Bernstein D.A. Zittel M.C. Keck J.L. High-resolution structure of the E. coli RecQ helicase catalytic core.EMBO J. 2003; 22: 4910-4921Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). The HRDC probably has an auxiliary role in nucleic acid binding and is found in other helicase families and in some RNA nucleases (12Bernstein D.A. Keck J.L.

Structural mechanisms of human RecQ helicases WRN and BLM.Front. Genet. 2014; 5: 366Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Because the helicase core of RecQ family helicases is highly conserved with similar DNA unwinding activities in vitro, a fundamental question that arises is how a deficiency or mutation of a particular RecQ helicase gives rise to strikingly different clinical syndromes. Furthermore, a large amount of literature has indicated that many differences, including characteristic biochemical, cellular, genetic, and organismal consequences, are observed among different RecQ helicase mutants (14Suhasini A.N. Brosh Jr., R.M. Disease-causing missense mutations in human DNA helicase disorders.Mutat. Res. 2013; 752: 138-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 15Ben Salah G. Hadj Salem I. Masmoudi A.

Rep. 2014; 41: 7373-7380Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Given that the ATPase and unwinding activities are common to all DNA helicases, some other physical properties of each helicase must govern its functional specificity. Besides the well conserved helicase core domain, the N-terminal domains present in RecQ enzymes are different and may confer important and specific functions (10Vindigni A. Marino F. Gileadi O. Probing the structural basis of RecQ helicase function.Biophys. Chem. 2010; 149: 67-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 16Vindigni A. Hickson I.D. RecQ helicases: multiple structures for multiple functions?.HFSP J. 2009; 3: 153-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). For example, the N-terminal domain of WRN and its orthologues are unique in containing an exonuclease function (17Xue Y. Ratcliff G.C. Wang H. Davis-Searles P.R. Gray M.D. Erie D.A. Redinbo M.R.

In this regard, elucidation of the structure and function of N-terminal domains of other helicases may be one of the most important strategies to provide some new insights for understanding the functional specificity of a given RecQ helicase in cells. BS is an autosomal recessive genetic disorder characterized by short stature and a skin rash that develops after sun exposure (18Rodermund O.E. Hausmann D. Bloom syndrome: review and definition.Fortschr. Med. 1978; 96: 1852-1858PubMed Google Scholar). BLM protein has been extensively characterized due to the fact that patients with BS are predisposed to the development of many cancer types (19Nicotera T.M.

Despite its biological importance, the N-terminal structural characterization remains to be elucidated. To facilitate the study, we have expressed and purified fragments in the N-terminal domain of human BLM protein and orthologous BLM proteins from Gallus gallus (gBLM) and Pelecanus crispus (pBLM). In this work, by a combination of bioinformatics, biochemical, and structural approaches, we reveal that the N-terminal domain of BLM protein is highly divergent both in sequence and structure. In general, the N-terminal domain is loosely structured and potentially lacks conserved global three-dimensional structures. However, a highly conserved DHBN forms a dimer and is implicated in oligomerization of BLM protein. Moreover, the unwinding activity of gBLM is regulated by the different oligomers, and the dimer is the basic unit to form a hexamer. These findings shed new light on the enzymatic properties and structure of BLM protein and deepen our understanding of the molecular basis of the functional specificity of BLM in cells. To probe whether the N-terminal domains are evolutionarily conserved in sequence and structure, we performed multiple-sequence alignment of most homologous proteins of BLM (BLMs) in the reference proteome database (see “Experimental Procedures”) and constructed a phylogenetic tree (supplemental Fig. S1). These data reveal that the N-terminal domain of BLM displays three striking features. (i) It lacks sequence conservation among orthologs. By scanning over 78 BLM sequences from different species, we found that the sequences of the helicase core region were highly conserved with an average 81.7% identity and 89.9% similarity, whereas those of the N-terminal domain varied greatly within and across species. Moreover, the divergence of the N-terminal sequences was particularly evident in invertebrates. For example, the sequence identity and similarity in flies were as low as 9.5 and 17.0%, respectively. (ii) According to the calculated coverage, identity of each residue position based on the alignment and disordered tendency (Fig. 1A), we found that the N-terminal domain contained a large proportion of random coils but a low proportion of α-helices or/and β-strands. Furthermore, the distribution of α-helices and β-strands was highly random among the N-terminal sequences. Therefore, the N-terminal domain is poorly structured or intrinsically unstructured. Indeed, the purified N-terminal domain of gBLM (gBLM(1–612)) was eluted as a single peak in the dead volume, indicating that it is a high order oligomer (≥800 kDa) (Fig. 1B). Furthermore, limited proteolysis of the N-terminal domain and helicase core showed that the helicase core fragment was more resistant to protease digestion than the N-terminal domain (Fig. 1C), indicating loose structural organization of the N-terminal domain. (iii) Despite the N-terminal domain lacking the general sequence and structural conservation, a protein fragment harboring about 50–60 amino acids with a potentially 2–3 α-helix conformation is highly conserved (Fig. 2A), which contains the previously named BDHCT domain (Bloom's syndrome DEAD helicase C-terminal domain) (29Staub E. Fiziev P. Rosenthal A. Hinzmann B. Insights into the evolution of the nucleolus by an analysis of its protein domain repertoire.Bioessays. 2004; 26: 567-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). In this study, we propose to refer it as the dimerization helical bundle in N-terminal domain (DHBN) to emphasize that this domain with helical bundle structure in the N-terminal domain but not in the C-terminal domain regulates the protein dimerization. Phylogenetic analysis reveals that many DHBNs locate in the middle of the N-terminal domain, whereas those of P. crispus and Calypte anna exist just at the beginning of the N terminus. Altogether, according to the above bioinformatics and biochemical analysis, along with the general rule that proteins with similar secondary elements (α-helices and β-strands) adopt similar three-dimensional structures (30Chothia C. Lesk A.M. The relation between the divergence of sequence and structure in proteins.EMBO J. 1986; 5: 823-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (1973) Google Scholar, 31Doolittle R.F. Similar amino acid sequences: chance or common ancestry?.Science. 1981; 214: 149-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar), we conclude that the N-terminal domain of BLM is loosely structured, and the overall three-dimensional structures should not be conserved within the N-terminal domains, except for the highly conserved DHBN. hDHBN (human BLM (362–414)) crystals were resolved in two space groups, C2221 and P62 (Fig. 2A and Table 1). The asymmetric unit of hDHBN in space groups C2221 and P62 contains 4 and 12 molecules, respectively (Fig. 2, B and C). The common unit between the two space groups is a dimer. Two dimers and six dimers are present in the asymmetric unit in C2221 and P62, respectively. The two dimers in C2221 interact with each other by means of loose contacts between the two centrally located N termini. Although this kind of association is also present in P62 crystal form, the dimer of dimers cannot be exactly superimposed, and different symmetry is found for the six dimers. Dimers association is thus dependent on crystal packing.TABLE 1Data collection and refinement statistics of the three BLM DHBN proteinsParameterhDHBNgDHBN SeMetpDHBN NativeNativeNativePDB code5LUP5MK55LUT5LUSPhasing methodSIRASMolecular replacementSADMolecular replacementData collection Space groupP 62C 2 2 21P 21 21 2P 21 Cell dimensions a, b, c (Å)132.8, 132.8, 65.034.1, 144.7, 96.876.7, 230.8, 50.962.2, 72.4, 79.4 Wavelength (Å)0.97541.70.97540.9754 Resolution (Å)43.47–2.032 (2.105–2.032)aStatistics for the highest resolution shell are shown in parentheses.27.84–2.16 (2.237–2.16)54.30–2.72 (2.817–2.718)36.20–1.43 (1.484–1.433) Total reflections338,112 (11,778)68,723 (7278)292,931 (30,951)34,0631 (16,186) Unique reflections41,409 (3643)12,345 (1292)25,190 (2297)105,436 (6793) Completeness (%)0.98 (0.87)0.93 (0.99)0.98 (0.93)0.83 (0.54) Mean I/σ(I)18.34 (1.84)19.63 (3.75)18.81 (2.32)18.56 (2.26) Rmerge0.07402 (0.5345)0.08213 (0.1837)0.1069 (1.896)0.03409 (0.3467) CC1/20.999 (0.767)0.996 (0.988)0.999 (0.826)0.998 (0.893) PhasingNo. of sites2212FOM0.170.21FOM after solvent flattening0.620.73 No. of molecules in the asymmetric unit1241110Data refinement Reflections (Rwork)41,411 (3643)12,342 (1293)24,903 (2295)105,372 (6786) Reflections (Rfree)1987 (167)1064 (112)1234 (136)5243 (343) Rwork0.1818 (0.2628)0.2238 (0.2540)0.2334 (0.3184)0.1574 (0.2256) Rfree0.2246 (0.3253)0.3012 (0.3294)0.2828 (0.3740)0.1712 (0.2563) Solvent42.9247.2664.8640.99 Protein residues617205530494 B-factor40.2343.076.2133.02 r.m.s.d., bonds (Å)0.0070.0020.0090.009 r.m.s.d., angles (degrees)0.960.401.121.23 Ramachandran favored (%)9899991e+02 Ramachandran allowed (%)1.201.001.000.21 Ramachandran disallowed (%)0.34000a Statistics for the highest resolution shell are shown in parentheses. Open table in a new tab Meanwhile, to rule out the possibility that the above dimeric structure is an artifact of crystal packing, we characterized two additional DHBNs from G. gallus (gDHBN) and P. crispus (pDHBN), the latter of which is located at the N terminus rather than between the N terminus and helicase core (Fig. 2A). gDHBN crystals belong to space group P21212 with unit cell a = 76.7 Å, b = 230.8 Å, c = 50.9 Å, and α = β = γ = 90°. Native Patterson analysis showed the presence of a translational non-crystallographic symmetry (tNCS) vector, corresponding to 22% of the origin peak with coordinates (0.112, 0.5, 0). The structure was solved by SAD on a SeMet derivative. The tNCS may explain the high Rfree value (28.2%) at the end of refinement. The asymmetric unit contains 11 chains named A–K having slightly different lengths (Table 1 and Fig. 2D). Most chains encompass residues 310–359, but chains J and K, which are less well defined and built without side chains, are shorter, comprising residues 320–359 and residues 311–332, respectively. The chains are packed in a continuous arrangement in the asymmetric unit. Dimers are formed between molecules A and B, C and D, F and G, and H and I. Chain E forms a dimer with its crystallographic 2-fold symmetry mate E′. Chains J and K form a more complicated dimer; chain K consists of a single α-helix in interaction with chain J, but its crystallographic 2-fold symmetry mate K′ is also in contact with chain J. Therefore, this unusual asymmetric unit contains 10.5 molecules: dimers of A and B, C and D, F and G, and H and I contribute 8 molecules; dimer E-E′ contributes 1 molecule by crystallographic 2-fold axis; dimer K-J contributes 1.5 molecules; and molecule K and K′ mimic an entire monomer. Additionally, pDHBN was crystallized in space group P21 with unit cell a = 62.2 Å, b = 72.4 Å, c = 79.2 Å, α = 90°, β = 99.4°, γ = 90°. The structure was solved by molecular replacement with hDHBN structure. The asymmetric unit contains 10 molecules, which form five dimers between chains A and B, C and D, E and F, G and H, and I and J (Table 1 and Fig. 2E). Contacts between molecules in the asymmetric unit and crystallographic symmetry mates are different from hDHBN and gDHBN. Thus, we have crystallized DHBN orthologous domains in four crystal forms, which have distinct crystal packing, and the common unit among all the crystals of DHBN orthologs is the dimer structure, which is extremely conserved. Superimposition of the different hDHBN, gDHBN, and pDHBN dimers gives an average r.m.s.d. of 1.8 Å over 96 Cα (Fig. 2F). Altogether, these results indicate that the dimer is the basic unit of biological structure. Statistics processing and refinement data of the above three high resolution DHBN structures are summarized in Table 1. As shown in Fig. 2F, each DHBN dimer is composed of two “head-to-tail” V-shaped monomers formed of three α-helices. The helix α1 (362–384 for hDHBN, 306–329 for gDHBN, and 20–36 for pDHBN) and helix α3 (397–414 for hDHBN, 342–359 for gDHBN, and 49–66 for pDHBN) are separated by a junction formed by the short α2 helix (388–393 for hDHBN, 333–338 for gDHBN, and 40–45 for pDHBN). The angle between α1 and α3 is 120° (Fig. 2G). DHBN monomer has an internal pseudosymmetry; when the monomers are superimposed in the N to C orientation on the reverse C to N orientation, the r.m.s.d. is 3 Å for the Cα. Therefore, it seems at a first glance that the two monomers are related only by a 10-Å translation. However, the two monomers are arranged in an anti-parallel manner and are related by a 2-fold axis rotation. Thus, the interface is symmetric (isologous), with each monomer engaging the same interface in the dimer. One helix in one monomer is packed against another one of the other monomer; α1 of molecule A is packed against α3′ of molecule B, and α2 helices are packed against each other. This dimer has, therefore, an extensive buried surface of an average of 1300 Å2 for all DHBN structures (Fig. 2F). The comparison of DHBN orthologous structures reveals conserved features. The V-shaped conformation of DHBN monomer is stabilized by several interactions. A set of hydrophobic amino acids residues, including Ile-386, Pro-387, Leu-391, Leu-394, Gly-397, and Leu-400 (hDHBN numbering), constitute a hydrophobic core at the junction of α1, α2, and α3 helices (Fig. 3A). The relative position of α1 and α3 is further stabilized by the conserved acidic residues Asp-384 and Asp-388, which are in electrostatic interaction with conserved basic residues Arg-404, Arg-407, and Arg-408 in α3 (Fig. 3B), and the electrostatic interactions between Asp-384 and Arg-407 and between Asp-384 and Arg-408 are shown with the experimental electron density map obtained by SIRAS KI phasing in the final refined hDHBN model (contour level is at 2σ) (Fig. 3C (a)), and the same region of gDHBN is also representatively displayed (Fig. 3C (b)). DHBN dimer formation is mediated by hydrophobic interactions between the α-helices. α1 interacts with α3′ of the other monomer by hydrophobic interactions involving Leu-372 and Val-375 in α1 and Ile-406, Leu-410, and Leu-411 in α3′ (Fig. 3D). The structure does not have the characteristics of a canonical coiled-coil, because the specific spacing of hydrophobic residues is not present. Interactions between α2 and α2′ involve residues Leu-382, Ile-383, Ile-386, and Leu-394 of both monomers (Fig. 3E). The V-shape with the interhelical angle of 120° between the helices α1 and α3 is reminiscent of the helix-turn-helix (HTH) (32Wintjens R. Rooman M. Structural classification of HTH DNA-binding domains and protein-DNA interaction modes.J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 262: 294-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar) and EF-hand motifs (33Lewit-Bentley A. Réty S. EF-hand calcium-binding proteins.Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2000; 10: 637-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar), which are 110° (Trp repressor, PDB code 1TRO) and 117° (S100A10, PDB code 1BT6), respectively. However, when the structures are superimposed on the first helix, the second helix has a different spatial location. The DHBN has, therefore, a different conformation from those of the HTH and EF-hands (Fig. 3F). A search of structural homologs of the dimeric DHBN with DALI gave a significant hit (Z-score 7.4) with Syngap, a Ras GTPase-activating protein (PDB code 3BXJ) (Fig. 3G). The homolog structural elements found in Syngap are in the GAPex domain between GTPase domain and C2 domain (34Pena V. Hothorn M. Eberth A. Kaschau N. Parret A. Gremer L. Bonneau F. Ahmadian M.R. Scheffzek K. The C2 domain of SynGAP is essential for stimulation of the Rap GTPase reaction.EMBO Rep. 2008; 9: 350-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). When superimposed, the r.m.s.d. is 3.7 Å calculated on 94 Cα. This result suggests that the DHBN may possess an intrinsic structural property that is involved in protein-protein interaction either intermolecularly or intramolecularly. To distinguish whether the observed molecular association in the asymmetric unit reflects real quaternary structure or a crystal packing artifact, gel filtration chromatography, dynamic light scattering, and small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) were performed to gain insight into the intrinsic oligomeric property of gDHBN in solution. Surprisingly, on gel filtration chromatography, the gDHBN was eluted at the fraction corresponding to a tetramer (27.6 kDa) (the crystal structures are compatible with a dimer of dimer); similarly, the hydrodynamic radius of gDHBN determined by dynamic light scattering (DLS) also displays an apparent molecular mass of 26.1 kDa. To clarify the situation, the solution conformation of gDHBN was further determined by SAXS with SEC-HPLC coupled with SAXS data collection (Fig. 3H). A single peak was eluted, corresponding exactly to the molecular mass of the dimer. The modeling results demonstrate that gDHBN has a conformation in a triangle-like conformation and fits well with our crystal model with a final χ2 of 4.72 (Fig. 3, H and I). All of the SAXS parameters are summarized in Table 2. Therefore, gDHBN has a conformation in solution close to the one observed in the crystal structure of dimeric form gDHBN. The higher apparent molecular weight deduced from gel filtration and DLS might be caused by the unstructured parts of gDHBN in solution, which create the non-spherical dimeric structure.TABLE 2SAXS data collection and processing of gDHBNParametersValuesData collection parameters InstrumentSWING Beam geometry (mm)0.4 × 0.1 Wavelength (Å)1.03 q range (Å−1)0.007–0.5 Exposure time (s)/no. of frames1/100 Concentration range (mg/ml)10 Temperature (K)288Structural parameters I(0) (cm−1) (from P(r))0.091 Rg (Å) (from P(r))20.9 I(0) (cm−1) (from Guinier)0.091 ± 2.7.10−5 Rg (Å) (from Guinier)20.4 ± 0.028 Dmax (Å)71.53 Porod estimate (Å3)28,041Molecular mass determination Partial specific volume (cm3·g−1)0.745 Contrast (Δρ × 1010 cm−2)2.736 Mr (from I(0))15,500 Calculated monomeric Mr from"
https://openalex.org/W2589689697,"Starch breakdown in leaves at night is tightly matched to the duration of the dark period, but the mechanism by which this regulation is achieved is unknown. In Arabidopsis chloroplasts, β-amylase BAM3 hydrolyses transitory starch, producing maltose and residual maltotriose. The aim of the current research was to investigate the regulatory and kinetic properties of BAM3. The BAM3 protein was expressed in Escherichia coli and first assayed using a model substrate. Enzyme activity was stimulated by treatment with dithiothreitol and was increased 40% by 2-10 μM Ca2+ but did not require Mg2+. In order to investigate substrate specificity and possible regulatory effects of glucans, we developed a GC-MS method to assay reaction products. BAM3 readily hydrolysed maltohexaose with a Km of 1.7 mM and Kcat of 4300 s-1 but activity was 3.4-fold lower with maltopentaose and was negligible with maltotetraose. With maltohexaose or amylopectin as substrates and using [UL-13C12]maltose in an isotopic dilution method, we discovered that BAM3 activity is inhibited by maltotriose at physiological (mM) concentrations, but not by maltose. In contrast, the extracellular β-amylase of barley is only weakly inhibited by maltotriose. Our results may explain the impaired starch breakdown in maltotriose-accumulating mutants such as dpe1 which lacks the chloroplast disproportionating enzyme (DPE1) metabolising maltotriose to glucose. We hypothesise that the rate of starch breakdown in leaves can be regulated by inhibition of BAM3 by maltotriose, the concentration of which is determined by DPE, which is in turn influenced by the stromal concentration of glucose. Since the plastid glucose transporter pGlcT catalyses facilitated diffusion between stroma and cytosol, changes in consumption of glucose in the cytosol are expected to lead to concomitant changes in plastid glucose and maltotriose, and hence compensatory changes in BAM3 activity."
https://openalex.org/W2589901661,"Conflict settings and refugee camps can be chaotic places, with large and rapid population movements, exacerbated public health problems, and ad hoc health services. Reproductive health care that includes family planning is of heightened importance in such settings, however, funding and resources tend to be constrained and geared towards acute health services such as trauma management and infectious disease containment. Here we report on the complexities and challenges of providing family planning in a post-emergency refugee setting, using the example of the largest refugee camp on the Thai-Myanmar border, in existence now for over 30 years. Data from 2009 demonstrates an upward trend in uptake of all contraceptives, especially long acting reversible contraception (LARC) and permanent methods (e.g. sterilization) over time. Increased uptake occurred during periods of time when there were boosts in funding or when barriers to access were alleviated. For example a surgeon fluent in local languages is correlated with increased uptake of tubal ligation in females. These data indicate that funding directed toward contraceptives in this refugee setting led to increases in contraceptives use. However, contraceptive uptake estimates depend on the baseline population which is difficult to measure in this setting. As far as we are aware, this is the longest reported review of family planning services for a refugee camp setting to date. The lessons learned from this setting may be valuable given the current global refugee crisis."
https://openalex.org/W2590503268,"The discovery and application of CRISPR/Cas9 technology for genome editing has greatly accelerated targeted mutagenesis in a variety of organisms. CRISPR/Cas9-mediated site-specific cleavage is typically exploited for the generation of insertions or deletions (indels) after aberrant dsDNA repair via the endogenous non-homology end-joining (NHEJ) pathway or, alternatively, for enhancing homology-directed repair to facilitate the generation of a specific mutation (or “knock-in”). However, there is a need for efficient cellular assays that can measure Cas9/guide RNA activity. Reliable methods for enriching and identifying desired mutants are also lacking. Here we describe a method using the Piggybac transposon for stable genomic integration of an H2B-GFP reporter or a hygromycin resistance gene for assaying Cas9 target cleavage and homology-directed repair. The H2B-GFP fusion protein provides increased stability and an obvious pattern of nuclear localization. This method, called SRIRACCHA (i.e. a stable, but reversible, integrated reporter for assaying CRISPR/Cas-stimulated HDR activity), enables the enrichment of mutants via selection of GFP-positive or hygromycin-resistant mammalian cells (immortalized or non-immortalized) as a surrogate for the modification of the endogenous target site. Currently available hyperactive Piggybac transposase mutants allow both delivery and removal of the surrogate reporters, with minimal risk of generating undesirable mutations. This assay permits rapid screening for efficient guide RNAs and the accelerated identification of mutant clones and is applicable to many cell types.

Sontheimer E.J. CRISPR interference limits horizontal gene transfer in staphylococci by targeting DNA.Science. 2008; 322: 1843-1845Crossref PubMed Scopus (1197) Google Scholar). The adoption of the CRISPR/Cas9 system from Staphylococcus pyogenes, typically employing a single protein SpCas9 and a single synthetic gRNA, has brought about widespread implementation of this powerful site-specific RGEN for generating knockouts or precise gene editing in a wide variety of eukaryotic cell types, e.g. in plants, invertebrates, and mammals, including human cells.

Since the description of the CRISPR/Cas9 technology in eukaryotes, it has quickly gained popularity over other similar approaches such as the transcription activator-like effector nuclease (TALEN). The popularity of RGENs is due to their simplicity of design and high efficiency in a variety of mammalian cell types and embryos for both somatic and germ line mutagenesis. Specificity of this RGEN system is conferred by a 20-nucleotide region of the gRNA, which targets the Cas9 nuclease to complementary dsDNA sequences (i.e. protospacers) immediately followed by a protospacer adjacent motif (PAM), which for SpCas9 systems is NGG, and is required for Cas9 recognition and cleavage. Although both RGEN and TALEN (transcription activator-like effector nuclease) techniques harness nonspecific DNA endonucleases to generate double-stranded breaks (DSBs) (with both systems able to achieve high efficiency), RGEN use has accelerated because of the ease of generating gRNAs using standard cloning techniques and in vitro transcription or RNA polymerase III promoters. However, CRISPR/Cas9 RGENs have the potential for off-target effects (2.Fu Y. Foden J.A. Khayter C. Maeder M.L. Reyon D. Joung J.K. Sander J.D.

Alternatively, higher specificity can be achieved through modified RGEN approaches, such as the paired nickase approach with the Cas9D10A mutant and two gRNAs, which has greatly improved fidelity of RGENs for the generation of DSBs without a substantial loss of efficiency (3.Ran F.A.

However, the practical application of CRISPR/Cas9 for generating knockouts (through the generation of DSBs and deletions) or precise gene editing (for knock-ins via homology directed repair with a donor template) still requires assaying multiple gRNAs for optimal activity/specificity and screening many cellular clones to identify the desired mutation. The Piggybac (PB) transposon is a cut-and-paste mobile DNA element originally isolated from Trichoplusia ni and has undergone successive modifications through both codon optimization and directed evolution to generate one of the most highly active transposons for use in mammalian cells (25.Yusa K. Zhou L. Li M.A. Bradley A. Craig N.L. A hyperactive piggyBac transposase for mammalian applications.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2011; 108: 1531-1536Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar, 26.Cadiñanos J. Bradley A. Generation of an inducible and optimized piggyBac transposon system.Nucleic Acids Res. 2007; 35: e87Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Typical applications exploit PB for stable integration of foreign DNA into the genome as a safer and easier alternative to retroviral vectors in cell types that can be transfected with low or modest efficiency. The PB transposon acts by precise mobilization into TTAA sequences, with a modest preference for transcriptional units (27.Liang Q. Kong J. Stalker J. Bradley A. Chromosomal mobilization and reintegration of Sleeping Beauty and PiggyBac transposons.Genesis. 2009; 47: 404-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). PB can mobilize multiple copies of a transposon into the genome with high efficiency (28.Ding S. Wu X. Li G. Han M. Zhuang Y. Xu T. Efficient transposition of the piggyBac (PB) transposon in mammalian cells and mice.Cell. 2005; 122: 473-483Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar) and can also mobilize very large pieces of DNA (up to 100 kb) (29.Li M.A. Turner D.J. Ning Z. Yusa K. Liang Q. Eckert S. Rad L. Fitzgerald T.W. Craig N.L. Bradley A. Mobilization of giant piggyBac transposons in the mouse genome.Nucleic Acids Res. 2011; 39: e148Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Another highly unique and practical property of the PB DNA transposon is the ability to both mobilize and remove integrated transposons using the PB transposase (PBase). With the development of an excision-only (Exc+Int−) mutant PBase (30.Li X. Burnight E.R. Cooney A.L. Malani N. Brady T. Sander J.D. Staber J. Wheelan S.J. Joung J.K. McCray Jr., P.B. Bushman F.D.

U.S.A. 2013; 110: E2279-E2287Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), transposons can now be removed without the risk of reintegration. Lastly, one key advantage of PB is its “footprint-free” mobilization whereby sequence integrity around the TTAA integration site is preserved after excision of the PB transposon (28.Ding S. Wu X.

Despite the success of RGENs for gene knock-out or editing, their performance is largely determined by the quality and specificity of guide RNAs. In the nucleus, chromatin accessibility, nuclease cleavage efficiency, and successful repair through NHEJ or HDR likely affect the successful generation of desired mutations. Examining site-specific nuclease activity in cells after the introduction of RGEN components is possible using Surveyor® or T7 endonuclease 1 (T7E1). These mismatch detection enzymes cleave bulges in DNA heteroduplexes consisting of wild type and mutated DNA strands (35.Mashal R.D. Koontz J. Sklar J. Detection of mutations by cleavage of DNA heteroduplexes with bacteriophage resolvases.Nat. Genet. 1995; 9: 177-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 36.Qiu P. Shandilya H. D'Alessio J.M. O'Connor K. Durocher J. Gerard G.F. Mutation detection using Surveyor nuclease.Biotechniques. 2004; 36: 702-707Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, these assays are not very sensitive or easily quantifiable, whereas more quantitative methods, such as high throughput targeted deep sequencing, can be prohibitively expensive, especially when assaying large numbers of gRNAs. Our goal here is to exploit the PB DNA transposon to deliver into the mammalian genome of cultured cells a reporter construct that provides a read-out of site-specific nuclease cleavage. Through transfection of a repair “donor” template, reporter expression (H2B-GFP or a hygromycin resistance gene) is restored through HDR after the generation of a DSB. Perhaps most useful of all, purification of H2B-GFP cells and/or selection of hygromycin-resistant cells enables the enrichment of mutant clones. Furthermore, the properties of the PB transposon enable the seamless removal of integrated transposons after the selection and characterization of desired mutations at endogenous target loci. This approach both accelerates gRNA validation and the generation of desired mutations. The transposable SRIRACCHA GFP reporter consists of a CMV-driven puromycin resistance gene followed by a single cloning site for inserting endonuclease target sequences, a short polyadenylation signal, and an out-of-frame H2B-tagged GFP, which lacks a start codon followed by two chicken hypersensitive site IV (HSIV) insulator sequences to prevent silencing by heterochromatin. A schematic for a paired nickase (Cas9D10A) target, with two SpCas9 protospacers and PAMs, is shown (Fig. 1A). A donor plasmid is co-transfected with RGEN components (Cas9 and gRNAs) to promote repair and gene conversion via HDR. The donor plasmid contains the puromycin resistance gene linked to the H2B-GFP open reading frame via a T2A peptide coding sequence. A typical SRIRACCHA assay with this GFP reporter entails co-transfection of all components, including a plasmid encoding the hyperactive PB transposase (CMV-hyPBase) and co-transfection with an RFP expression plasmid (CMV-tdT) for normalization. Cutting and HDR of the transposon target yields expression of GFP. Quantification of GFP-positive cells relative to RFP-positive cells thus provides a read-out of nuclease activity. To optimize signal to noise, we titrated transposon, PBase, donor, and gRNA (Fig. 1, B and C). Ratios of 3:1 for transposon:hyPBase and 3:2 for donor:gRNA were optimal, with an approximate 4-fold induction in RGEN activity with relatively low background with this gRNA. These ratios were adopted for subsequent experiments. Because genome engineering should ideally exhibit high fidelity, we tested a strategy using an inducible Cas9 nuclease to limit the temporal window of nuclease activity. In conjunction with this, we used the Cas9 nickase (Cas9D10A) for paired nicking of target sites, which has been demonstrated to significantly improve fidelity (3.Ran F.A. Hsu P.D. Lin C.Y.

In our approach 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4-OH-T) and doxycycline (dox) regulate Cas9D10A expression and nuclear localization (Fig. 1D). As shown in Fig. 1E, there is very little nuclease activity in the absence of 4-OH-T and dox compared with a nonspecific (NS) gRNA using this inducible SRIRACCHA (iSRIRACCHA) method. Dual control with both 4-OH-T and dox further reduced leaky expression and nuclease activity compared with either 4-OH-T or dox alone (Fig. 1F). We also used iSRIRACCHA to measure HDR with and without the transposase (Fig. 1E). Without the transposase, the signal was significantly reduced due to the transient nature of the episomal plasmid. The use of PB, therefore, amplifies and extends the lifetime of the signal via stable integration of the GFP reporter into the genome. The iSRIRACCHA method generated robust inducible signal in both HeLa and HEK293T cells, but for unknown reasons the background GFP signal was lower in HeLa cells (Fig. 1, G and H), and this cell line was used for subsequent assays. We next sought to determine whether SRIRACCHA could distinguish different activities of gRNAs in their ability to generate insertions or deletions (indels) at endogenous target loci. We designed gRNAs corresponding to three targets sites in mouse Smad4, Pten, Trp53, and Apc and assayed activity using the paired nickase approach and two gRNAs per target (Fig. 2, A–D) or the wild type Cas9 and a single gRNA per target (Fig. 2, E–H). One gRNA of each gRNA pair (used for the paired nickase assay) was used for the wild type Cas9 assay. As expected, varying CRISPR activity was observed with different gRNAs that target the same gene. The gRNA pairs targeting Apc exhibited the most variation using the paired nickase with varying signal to noise ratios, whereas Smad4 exhibited the greatest variability using the wild type Cas9. To determine whether the CRISPR/Cas9 nuclease activity measured by SRIRACCHA corresponds to the cutting frequency of endogenous sites in the genome, we subjected single gRNAs or gRNA pairs (using wild type Cas9 or the Cas9 nickase) for testing by targeted deep sequencing of nuclease target sites in the mouse Smad4, Pten, Trp53, and Apc genes after transfection in mouse N2A cells. This enabled the quantification of indels after NHEJ, which is proportional to the cutting frequency by Cas9. Murine N2A cells were nucleofected with gRNAs for RGEN cleavage by the wild type or nickase Cas9 nuclease. Nuclease target sites in Smad4, Pten, Trp53, or Apc were PCR-amplified and subsequently analyzed by Illumina deep sequencing. As shown in Fig. 2I, when Cas9D10A was used, the relative NHEJ activity of gRNA pairs targeting each gene was consistent with the relative -fold change of activity reflected by our CRISPR reporter assay, except for two gRNAs specific for target sites in Trp53. However, in this nickase experiment, gRNA pairs specific for the Trp53 target site T2 exhibited the highest signal to noise ratio both by deep sequencing assay and SRIRACCHA. Both assays yielded a similar trend for Pten gRNAs and Trp53 gRNAs with wild type Cas9. This was not the case for targeting of Smad4 and Apc using wild type Cas9. We consistently see greater sensitivity and signal using Cas9D10A in the SRIRACCHA assay compared with wild type Cas9. This could possibly reflect enhanced HDR using the paired nickase. We then used the T1 gRNA pairs and the Cas9D10A nickase to introduce indels into the Pten, Apc, or Smad4 genes in wild type C57BL/6 (B6) mouse small intestine enteroids. The hCas9D10A and gRNA constructs were transfected into stem cell-enriched enteroids as previously described (39.Schwank G. Andersson-Rolf A. Koo B.K. Sasaki N. Clevers H. Generation of BAC transgenic epithelial organoids.PLoS ONE. 2013; 8: e76871Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Apc-inactivated enteroids were selected with medium lacking R-spondin. Pten-inactivated enteroids were selected with medium lacking EGF but containing the epidermal GFR/HER2 inhibitor lapatinib. And Smad4-inactivated enteroids were selected with medium lacking noggin. Mutations of Apc and Smad4 in enteroids were confirmed by targeted deep sequencing, whereas Pten mutations were quantified using the T7E1 assay (data not shown). Notably, these Apc−/− and Smad4−/− mouse enteroids exhibited similar morphological changes with the reported APC−/− and SMAD4−/− human intestinal enteroids (40.Matano M. Date S. Shimokawa M. Takano A. Fujii M. Ohta Y. Watanabe T. Kanai T. Sato T. Modeling colorectal cancer using CRISPR-Cas9-mediated engineering of human intestinal organoids.Nat. Med. 2015; 21: 256-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (721) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2J). The stable property of the SRIRACCHA reporter allows the identification of cells demonstrating CRISPR/Cas-stimulated HDR of the H2B-GFP reporter. We suspected that enrichment of GFP+ cells, which have undergone HDR after cleavage at the surrogate/synthetic site, would also enrich for cells containing indels at the endogenous target site. To confirm this we generated HeLa and DLD1 cell lines with a stably integrated GFP Piggybac transposon reporter containing a target site for NFE2L2 (Fig. 3A, left panel). The puromycin-selected cells were then transfected with the inducible RGEN nickase (iCas9N) and gRNA components. Twenty-four hours after transfection, dox and 4-OH-T were added to induce nuclease expression. When assayed 3 days after induction, SRIRACCHA reporter activity was induced >8-fold in HeLa cells and >20-fold in DLD1 cells (Fig. 3A, right panel). H2B-GFP-positive cells were also assayed for the presence of indels at endogenous NFE2L2 target sites, revealing a 2–4-fold increase in mutation frequency in H2B-GFP-positive cells relative to unsorted cells (Fig. 3, B and C). Because FACS sorting proved to be a reliable method for enriching mutant cells, we sought to streamline the selection process by substituting the H2B-GFP gene with a hygromycin resistance cassette that lacks a start codon (Fig. 4A). To test the hygromycin reporter assay, DLD1 cells were transfected with transposon and CRISPR/Cas9 nickase components. Then, 48 h after transfection, DLD1 cells wer"

Upon ovulation, the apical compartment of the oviduct epithelium is temporarily exposed to follicular fluid, which contains much higher levels of E2 than serum. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of human periovulatory follicular fluid levels of E2 on oviduct epithelial cells using two porcine in vitro models. Methods A cell line derived from the porcine oviductal epithelium (CCLV-RIE270) was characterized (lineage markers, proliferation characteristics and transformation status). Primary porcine oviduct epithelial cells (POEC) were cultured in air-liquid interface and differentiation was assessed histologically. Both cultures were exposed to E2 (10 ng/ml and 200 ng/ml). Proliferation of CCLV-RIE270 and POEC was determined by real-time impedance monitoring and immunohistochemical detection of Ki67. Furthermore, marker gene expression for DNA damage response (DDR) and inflammation was quantified. Results CCLV-RIE270 was not transformed and exhibited properties of secretory oviduct epithelial cells. Periovulatory follicular fluid levels of E2 (200 ng/ml) upregulated the expression of inflammatory genes in CCLV-RIE270 but not in POEC (except for IL8). Expression of DDR genes was elevated in both models. A significant increase in cell proliferation could not be detected in response to E2. Conclusions CCLV-RIE270 and POEC are complementary models to evaluate the consequences of oviduct exposure to follicular fluid components. Single administration of periovulatory follicular fluid E2 levels trigger inflammatory and DNA damage responses, but not proliferation in oviduct epithelial cells."

This study evaluated whether seasonality (daily number of hours of light) and acute variations in outdoor temperature and air pollutants may affect carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (PWV) and pressure augmentation.731 hypertensive patients (30-88 years, 417 treated) were enrolled in a cross-sectional study during a 5-year period. PWV, central BP, Augmentation Index (AIx) and Augmentation Pressure (AP) were measured in a temperature-controlled (22-24°C) room. Data of the local office of the National Climatic Data Observatory were used to estimate meteorological conditions and air pollutants (PM10, O3, CO, N2O) exposure on the same day.PWV (mean value 8.5±1.8 m/s) was related to age (r = 0.467, p<0.001), body mass index (r = 0.132, p<0.001), central systolic (r = 0.414, p<0.001) and diastolic BP (r = 0.093, p = 0.013), daylight hours (r = -0.176, p<0.001), mean outdoor temperature (r = -0.082, p = 0.027), O3 (r = -0.135, p<0.001), CO (r = 0.096, p = 0.012), N2O (r = 0.087, p = 0.022). In multiple linear regression analysis, adjusted for confounders, PWV remained independently associated only with daylight hours (β = -0.170; 95% CI: -0.273 to -0.067, p = 0.001). No significant correlation was found between pressure augmentation and daylight hours, mean temperature or air pollutants. The relationship was stronger in untreated patients and women. Furthermore, a positive, independent association between O3 levels and PWV emerged in untreated patients (β: 0.018; p = 0.029; CI: 0.002 to 0.034) and in women (β: 0.027; p = 0.004; CI: 0.009 to 0.045).PWV showed a marked seasonality in hypertensive patients. Environmental O3 levels may acutely reduce arterial stiffness in hypertensive women and in untreated patients."
https://openalex.org/W2589630011,"Background & aim There is evidence that maternal viral load of HCV during delivery influences the risk for Mother-to-child transmission (MTCT), but this does not explain all cases. We study the role of the immunogenetic profile (HLA, KIRs and KIR-ligand binding) of mothers and children in HCV-MTCT and in chronicity in the children. Methodology 79 HCV-RNA (+) mothers and their 98 children were included. 24 children were infected, becoming chronic in 8 cases and clearing in 16. HLA-class-I and II and KIRs were determined by Luminex. Results MTCT study: The presence of HLA-C1-ligand in mothers and/or their children reduces the risk of transmission (mothers: Pc = 0.011, children: P = 0.033), whereas the presence of HLA-C2C2-ligand in mothers increases it (Pc = 0.011). In children KIR2DL3-HLA-C1 is a protector factor (Pc = 0.011). Chronicity in children study: Maternal DQA1*01 allele (Pc = 0.027), KIR2DS1 (Pc = 0.011) or KIR3DS1 (Pc = 0.011) favours chronicity in the child. The presence of the DQB1*03 allele (Pc = 0.027) and KIR2DS3 (P = 0.056) in the child and homozygosity for KIR3DL1/3DL1 (Pc = 0.011) and for the HLA-Bw4/Bw4 ligand (P = 0.027) is associated with viral clearance, whereas the presence of HLA-Bw6 ligand (P = 0.027), the binding of KIR3DS1-HLA-Bw4 (P = 0.037) and heterozygosity for KIR3DL1/3DS1 (Pc = 0.011) favour viral chronicity. Mother/child allele matching: In the joint HLA analysis, matching was greater between mothers and children with chronic infection vs those who had cleared the virus (67%±4.1 vs 57%±1.2, P = 0.003). Conclusions The HLA-C1 ligand in the mother is related to MTCT, while several genetic factors of the mother or child are involved in the chronification or clearance of infection in the child. Matching allelic data is considered to be an indicator of HCV chronicity in the child and can be used as a potential prognostic test. This implies that NK cells may play a previously undocumented role in protecting against MTCT and that both NK cell immunity and adaptive T-cell responses may influence viral clearance in infected children."

Based on 16S rDNA gene identity, strain JCM 31412T showed a close relationship with type strains of Vibrio brasiliensis (LMG 20546T, 98.2% identity), V. harveyi (NBRC 15634T, 98.2%), V. caribbeanicus (ATCC BAA-2122T, 97.8%) and V. proteolyticus (NBRC 13287T, 97.8%). The G+C content of strain JCM 31412T DNA was 46.8%. Multi-locus sequence analysis (MLSA) of eight loci (ftsZ, gapA, gyrB, mreB, pyrH, recA, rpoA and topA; 5535bp) further clustered strain JCM 31412T in the Nereis clade, genus Vibrio. Phenotypically, strain JCM 31412T differed from the closest related Vibrio species in its utilization of melibiose and raffinose, and its lack of casein and gelatin hydrolysis. It was further differentiated based on its fatty acid composition, specifically properties of C12:03OH and summed features, which were significantly different from those of V. brasiliensis, V. nigripulchritudo and V. caribbeanicus type strains. Overall, the results of DNA-DNA hybridization, and physiological and biochemical analysis differentiated strain JCM 31412T from other described species of the genus Vibrio. Based on these polyphasic taxonomic findings, it was therefore concluded that JCM 31412T was a novel Vibrio species, for which the name Vibrio japonicus sp. nov. was proposed, with JCM 31412T (= LMG 29636T = ATCC TSD-62T) as the type strain."
https://openalex.org/W2591439345,"During wound healing, skin function is restored by the action of several cell types that undergo differentiation, migration, proliferation and/or apoptosis. These dynamics are tightly regulated by the evolution of the extra cellular matrix (ECM) contents along the process. Pharmacologically active flavonoids have shown to exhibit useful physiological properties interesting in pathological states. Among them, oleanolic acid (OA), a pentacyclic triterpene, shows promising properties over wound healing, as increased cell migration in vitro and improved wound resolution in vivo. In this paper, we pursued to disclose the molecular mechanisms underlying those effects, by using an in vitro scratch assay in two epithelial cell lines of different linage: non-malignant mink lung epithelial cells, Mv1Lu; and human breast cancer cells, MDA-MB-231. In every case, we observed that OA clearly enhanced cell migration for in vitro scratch closure. This correlated with the stimulation of molecular pathways related to mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases, as ERK1,2 and Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) 1,2 activation and c-Jun phosphorylation. Moreover, MDA-MB-231 cells treated with OA displayed an altered gene expression profile affecting transcription factor genes (c-JUN) as well as proteins involved in migration and ECM dynamics (PAI1), in line with the development of an epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) status. Strikingly, upon OA treatment, we observed changes in the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) subcellular localization, while interfering with its signalling completely prevented migration effects. This data provides a physiological framework supporting the notion that lipophilic plant extracts used in traditional medicine, might modulate wound healing processes in vivo through its OA contents. The molecular implications of these observations are discussed."

In HCV genotype (GT) 1a, grazoprevir maintains potent activity against a majority of NS3 resistance-associated amino acid substitutions, including the highly prevalent and naturally occurring Q80K polymorphism that impacts simeprevir, another NS3/4A protease inhibitor. The basis for an unexpected difference in the clinical impact of some NS3 substitutions was investigated. Phenotypic analysis of resistance-associated substitutions identified in NS3 from GT1a-infected patients who failed therapy with grazoprevir (in combination with elbasvir, an inhibitor of HCV NS5A protein) showed that positions 56, 156, and 168 in NS3 were most impactful because they diminished protein-inhibitor interactions. Although an amino acid substitution from aspartic acid to alanine at position 168 (D168A) reduced the potency of grazoprevir, its combination with R155K unexpectedly nullified this effect. Molecular dynamics and free-energy surface studies indicated that Asp-168 is important in anchoring Arg-155 for ligand binding but is not critical for Lys-155 because of the inherent flexibility of its side chain. Moreover, modeling studies supported a strong direct cation-heterocycle interaction between the Lys-155 side chain of the double substitution, R155K/D168A, and the lone pair on the quinoxaline in grazoprevir. This unique interaction provides a structural basis for grazoprevir's higher potency than simeprevir, an inhibitor to which the double substitution confers a significant reduction in potency.

The medicinal chemistry efforts that led to its discovery and optimization of its activity have been reported (10.Liverton N.J. Holloway M.K. McCauley J.A. Rudd M.T. Butcher J.W. Carroll S.S.

The potency of grazoprevir derives, in part, from critical lipophilic interactions at the P2 position in addition to contributions from the P2-P4 constraint among others (10.Liverton N.J.

The clinical activity of grazoprevir in combination with elbasvir, an HCV NS5A replicase complex inhibitor, has been studied in HCV-infected patients. The combination is highly effective resulting in ≥94% SVR in treatment-naive GT1- and GT4-infected patients following a 12-week course of the regimen (12.Lawitz E. Gane E. Pearlman B. Tam E.

Although the presence of viruses bearing NS3 resistance-associated substitutions in patients prior to receiving therapy (i.e. those at baseline) did not impact treatment response (13Black S. Pak I. Ingravallo P. McMonagle P. Chase R. Shaughnessy M. Hwang P. Haber B. Harrigan P.R. Brumme C. Howe A.Y. J. Hepatol. 2015; 62: S677-S678Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar), additional treatment-emergent NS3 substitutions were observed in viruses isolated from patients who failed to achieve SVR. In an effort to obtain a deeper understanding of the impact of NS3 polymorphisms on inhibitor potency, these substitutions were further studied by engineering them into replicon cells. The impact of single amino acid substitutions at most positions could be readily rationalized from a structural standpoint. However, in a limited number of cases, a detailed analysis of the enzyme-inhibitor interactions was needed to address the basis of the resistance or lack thereof. In this report, we discuss the impact of clinically relevant NS3 resistance-associated amino acid substitutions in NS3/4A and the structural basis for their effects on grazoprevir potency. Grazoprevir is a quinoxaline macrocyclic compound that inhibits HCV NS3/4A protease activity with IC50 values in the picomolar to subnanomolar range in enzyme assays across HCV genotypes (Table 1). Although grazoprevir maintained potent activity across all genotypes, the least susceptible was the purified enzyme from GT3, whereas those from GT1 were the most susceptible. To assess the antiviral activity of grazoprevir in cell culture, the inhibitor was evaluated against replicons representing HCV clinical isolates. Grazoprevir demonstrated an EC50 in the subnanomolar to single-digit nanomolar range against HCV GT1–6 replicons (Table 2). As observed in the enzyme assay, it was less potent against the homologous full-length GT3a replicon compared with the other replicons. Interestingly, in a chimeric replicon bearing only the GT3a NS3 catalytic domain in the background of GT2a_JFH-1, the potency of grazoprevir was improved by greater than 10-fold compared with the full-length GT3_S52 replicon (Table 2). Thus, sequences outside of the catalytic domain influence inhibitor binding interactions. The data demonstrated that the in vitro enzyme activity of grazoprevir translates well to the cell-based replicon assay. More importantly, the data indicated that grazoprevir would have activity against a broad set of clinical isolates.Table 1Potency of grazoprevir against NS3/4A proteases isolated from HCV genotypesEnzymeaThe strain and GenBankTM accession numbers for the HCV reference sequences are indicated in parentheses.IC50 ± S.D.bThe standard deviation is n ≥ 3.nmGT1a (H77; NC_004102)0.007 ± 0.001GT1b (BK; M58335)0.004 ± 0.001GT2a (JFH1; AB047639)0.067 ± 0.024GT2b (J8; D10988)0.135 ± 0.051GT3a (NZL1; D17763)0.690 ± 0.194GT4a (ED43; GU814265)0.062 ± 0.031GT5a (1209A014cThis is the patient sequence identifier.)0.067 ± 0.022GT6a (6a77; DQ480512)0.034 ± 0.007a The strain and GenBankTM accession numbers for the HCV reference sequences are indicated in parentheses.b The standard deviation is n ≥ 3.c This is the patient sequence identifier.

Open table in a new tab NS3/4A protease inhibitors (PI) are effective in patients infected with GT1; however, a number of amino acid substitutions have been observed particularly among HCV GT1a patients who failed to achieve SVR following treatment with NS3/4A PI-containing regimens (14.Lontok E. Harrington P. Howe A. Kieffer T. Lennerstrand J. Lenz O. McPhee F. Mo H. Parkin N. Pilot-Matias T. Miller V. Hepatitis C virus drug resistance-associated substitutions: state of the art summary.Hepatology. 2015; 62: 1623-1632Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Thus, we tested grazoprevir against several of these GT1a NS3 substitutions to evaluate its activity. We selected a number of frequently detected amino acid substitutions in virologic failures as test cases. The substitutions span key positions in NS3/4A that have been associated with resistance to the PI class. In addition, the examples chosen have been broadly identified in GT1a patients who failed to achieve SVR when treated with NS3/4A protease inhibitors. Grazoprevir maintained broad activity against substitutions at a majority of these key positions in GT1a NS3/4A (Table 3). Among the substitutions that did not impact grazoprevir activity were V36M, T54S, V55I, V107I, and S122R. Another group of replicons conferred only a modest reduction (<5-fold) in inhibitory activity. These amino acid substitutions included R155K, A156G, D168N, and I170T. The least susceptible group of substitutions for grazoprevir were observed at positions 56 and 168 (Table 3). Generally, substitutions primarily selected by linear α-ketoamide inhibitors such as boceprevir (for example those located at positions 36, 54, and 55) did not confer a reduction in potency to grazoprevir. Substitutions that were more impactful to grazoprevir also conferred resistance to simeprevir, another Food & Drug Administration-approved macrocyclic inhibitor that was tested as another member of the NS3/4A macrocyclic class of protease inhibitors.Table 3Potency of grazoprevir and NS3/4A protease inhibitors in replicons bearing HCV GT1a NS3 amino acid substitutionsGT1a repliconGrazoprevirBoceprevirSimeprevirEC50± S.D.aThe standard deviation is n ≥ 3.-Fold shiftEC50± S.D.aThe standard deviation is n ≥ 3.-Fold shiftEC50± S.D.aThe standard deviation is n ≥ 3.-Fold shiftnmnmnmWT0.4 ± 0.2275 ± 1383.2 ± 2.6V36M0.3 ± 0.20.8919 ± 4513.311.2 ± 8.23.5T54S0.3 ± 0.20.81559 ± 10025.75.1 ± 2.31.6V55I0.2 ± 0.10.5207 ± 890.84.9 ± 4.91.5Y56H5.7 ± 4.314432 ± 1791.640 ± 2213Q80K0.3 ± 0.30.8182 ± 880.717 ± 75.3V107I0.3 ± 0.10.8340 ± 801.27.1 ± 2.92.2S122R0.4 ± 0.11.0110 ± 440.4114 ± 5336R155K1.3 ± 0.73.3980 ± 6763.619 ± 95.9A156G1.7 ± 0.14.31240 ± 1164.5106 ± 1033D168A29 ± 1373154 ± 1260.666 ± 5221D168E4.9 ± 4.212215 ± 930.829 ± 229.1D168G9.6 ± 6.924285 ± 191.020 ± 116.3D168N0.9 ± 0.42.3230 ± 1350.821 ± 206.6D168V10.5 ± 5.026834 ± 1243.0>2000>625D168Y6.9 ± 5.217246 ± 1310.91269 ± 735397I170T0.7 ± 0.31.8440 ± 1751.622 ± 186.9a The standard deviation is n ≥ 3. Open table in a new tab Among the GT1a substitutions, the impact of Q80K was of particular interest as this naturally occurring polymorphism is observed in 40–50% of NS3 sequences in GT1a-infected patients and has been reported to confer resistance to simeprevir (15.Jacobson I.M.

Hepatol. 2015; 62: 1008-1014Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The Q80K substitution remained susceptible to grazoprevir. The crystal structures of grazoprevir and simeprevir bound to NS3/4A protease from GT1a provided a structural rationale for the lack of an effect of Q80K on grazoprevir's activity. As shown in Fig. 2, Gln-80 is located at the periphery of the S2 subsite. The backbone C=O of Gln-80 makes a hydrogen bond with the guanidinium group of Arg-155 to stabilize the salt bridge between Arg-155 and Asp-168. The stability of Arg-155 could also benefit from a second hydrogen bond with the side chain of Gln-80. The Q80K substitution would lose this hydrogen bond because the Lys-80 side chain will move away from Arg-155 due to electrostatic repulsion between the two positively charged residues and therefore affect the stability of Arg-155 slightly. As grazoprevir only has limited interactions with Arg-155 through the P2-P4 linker, it is not surprising that this substitution has little impact on the binding of grazoprevir. In contrast, simeprevir makes extended van der Waals contacts with the guanidinium group of Arg-155, and the Q80K substitution would have been expected to have a greater impact on simeprevir as seen. Next, we evaluated the clinical significance of the in vitro findings by reviewing the prevalence of NS3/4A substitutions in patients who failed to achieve SVR in clinical studies with a grazoprevir-containing regimen. NS3/4A substitutions detected in a pooled analysis of treatment-naive mono-infected (12.Lawitz E. Gane E. Pearlman B. Tam E. Ghesquiere W. Guyader D. Alric L. Bronowicki J.P. Lester L. Sievert W.

The majority of substitutions among the 37 GT1a virologic failures occurred at amino acid position 168 in NS3 followed by changes at positions 156 and 56 (Fig. 3). All the substitutions that were detected in virologic failures were engineered into GT1a replicon cells and characterized phenotypically. As reported in Table 3, the Y56H and A156G substitutions conferred a 14- and 4.3-fold reduction in grazoprevir activity, respectively. The other substitutions at position 156 (A156T/A156V) resulted in replicons that were unfit and failed to grow in cell culture; they were not characterized any further. The D168A/D168G/D168N/D168V/D168Y substitutions resulted in fold shift reductions in potency for grazoprevir ranging from 2.3- to 73-fold. The NS3 substitutions also conferred potency reductions to simeprevir, another member of the macrocyclic class of inhibitors, but not to the α-ketoamide linear inhibitor boceprevir (Table 3). As multiple resistance-associated mutations can occur on the same viral genome, a more comprehensive view of the impact of substitutions involving combinations of amino acids that have been observed in patients who failed therapy with NS3/4A PIs were also characterized. Some of the double substitutions were engineered in transient replicons if a low replicon fitness was evident in the stable replicon. The summary of the impact of the combination of amino acid substitutions on grazoprevir's antiviral activity in the assay is presented in Table 4. The impact of almost all of the combination of substitutions (except R155K and D168A) on grazoprevir activity could be rationalized based on data from the individual substitutions and prior structural analysis of the interaction between grazoprevir and NS3/4A (11.Harper S.

For the Y56H/D168A double substitution, both amino acid changes together conferred a further potency loss compared with each individual substitution. In the crystal structure of the grazoprevir-NS3/4A complex (Fig. 4), the methoxyquinoxaline group of grazoprevir is in hydrophobic contact with one edge of the Tyr-56 phenyl ring. Mutation of Tyr-56 to a smaller histidine will disrupt this interaction and cause potency loss. This is also true for simeprevir where the isopropylthiazole group makes similar contact with Tyr-56. The potency loss is correlated with the extent of this hydrophobic interaction; grazoprevir and simeprevir both make more contact with Tyr-56 and hence have larger potency shifts. Because the Tyr-56 and Asp-168 residues are separated spatially with a distance of >14 Å, the additive effect of this double substitution on inhibitor potency can be rationalized by the independent"
https://openalex.org/W2591166355,"Post-translational modifications (PTMs) provide an extensible framework for regulation of protein behavior beyond the diversity represented within the genome alone. While the rate of identification of PTMs has rapidly increased in recent years, our knowledge of PTM functionality encompasses less than 5% of this data. We previously developed SAPH-ire (Structural Analysis of PTM Hotspots) for the prioritization of eukaryotic PTMs based on function potential of discrete modified alignment positions (MAPs) in a set of 8 protein families. A proteome-wide expansion of the dataset to all families of PTM-bearing, eukaryotic proteins with a representational crystal structure and the application of artificial neural network (ANN) models demonstrated the broader applicability of this approach. Although structural features of proteins have been repeatedly demonstrated to be predictive of PTM functionality, the availability of adequately resolved 3D structures in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) limits the scope of these methods. In order to bridge this gap and capture the larger set of PTM-bearing proteins without an available, homologous structure, we explored all available MAP features as ANN inputs to identify predictive models that do not rely on 3D protein structural data. This systematic, algorithmic approach explores 8 available input features in exhaustive combinations (247 models; size 2–8). To control for potential bias in random sampling for holdback in training sets, we iterated each model across 100 randomized, sample training and testing sets—yielding 24,700 individual ANNs. The size of the analyzed dataset and iterative generation of ANNs represents the largest and most thorough investigation of predictive models for PTM functionality to date. Comparison of input layer combinations allows us to quantify ANN performance with a high degree of confidence and subsequently select a top-ranked, robust fit model which highlights 3,687 MAPs, including 10,933 PTMs with a high probability of biological impact but without a currently known functional role."

The purpose of this investigation was to establish the validity and agreement of fEMG compared to sEMG to quantify typical transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) measures pre and post repetitive TMS (rTMS). The hypotheses were that fEMG would demonstrate excellent validity and agreement compared with sEMG.In ten healthy volunteers, paired pulse and cortical silent period (CSP) TMS measures were collected before and after 1200 pulses of 1Hz rTMS to the motor cortex. Data were simultaneously recorded with sEMG and fEMG in the first dorsal interosseous. Concurrent validity (r and rho) and agreement (Tukey mean-difference) were calculated.fEMG quantified corticospinal excitability with good to excellent validity compared to sEMG data at both pretest (r = 0.77-0.97) and posttest (r = 0.83-0.92). Pairwise comparisons indicated no difference between sEMG and fEMG for all outcomes; however, Tukey mean-difference plots display increased variance and questionable agreement for paired pulse outcomes. CSP displayed the highest estimates of validity and agreement. Paired pulse MEP responses recorded with fEMG displayed reduced validity, agreement and less sensitivity to changes in MEP amplitude compared to sEMG. Change scores following rTMS were not significantly different between sEMG and fEMG.fEMG electrodes are a valid means to measure CSP and paired pulse MEP responses. CSP displays the highest validity estimates, while caution is warranted when assessing paired pulse responses with fEMG. Corticospinal excitability and neuromodulatory aftereffects from rTMS may be assessed using fEMG."
https://openalex.org/W2589527606,"Interactions of hypothalamic signaling pathways that control body temperature (BT), blood pressure (BP), and energy balance are poorly understood. We investigated whether the chronic BP and metabolic actions of leptin are differentially modulated by changes in ambient temperature (TA). Mean arterial pressure (MAP), heart rate (HR), BT, motor activity (MA), and oxygen consumption (VO2) were measured 24 h/d at normal laboratory TA (23°C), at thermoneutral zone (TNZ, 30°C) for mice or during cold exposure (15°C) in male wild-type mice. After control measurements, leptin (4 mg/kg/min) or saline vehicle was infused for 7 d. At TNZ, leptin reduced food intake (-11.0 6 0.5 g cumulative deficit) and body weight by 6% but caused no changes in MAP or HR. At 15°C, leptin infusion did not alter food intake but increased MAP and HR (8 6 1 mmHg and 33 6 7 bpm), while VO2 increased by ∼10%. Leptin reduced plasma glucose and insulin levels at 15°C but not at 30°C. These results demonstrate that the chronic anorexic effects of leptin are enhanced at TNZ, while its effects on insulin and glucose levels are attenuated and its effects on BP and HR are abolished. Conversely, cold TA caused resistance to leptin's anorexic effects but amplified its effects to raise BP and reduce insulin and glucose levels. Thus, the brain circuits by which leptin regulates food intake and cardiovascular function are differentially influenced by changes in TA.—Do Carmo, J. M., da Silva, A. A., Romero, D. G., Hall, J. E.

We also find that kurtosis and skewness are lower in our simulation study of agents who are not confident. We show that the stock price and confidence index-both generated by our model-are cointegrated and that stock price affects confidence index but confidence index does not affect stock price. We next compare the results of our model with the S&P 500 index and its respective stock market confidence index using cointegration and Granger tests.

https://openalex.org/W2589620355,"Medulloblastoma comprises four main subgroups (WNT, SHH, Group 3 and Group 4) originally defined by transcriptional profiling. In primary medulloblastoma tissues, these groups are thought to be distinguishable using the immunohistochemical detection of β-catenin, filamin A, GAB1 and YAP1 protein markers. To investigate the utility of these markers for in vitro studies using medulloblastoma cell lines, immunoblotting and indirect immunofluorescence were employed for the detection of β-catenin, filamin A, GAB1 and YAP1 in both DAOY and D283 Med reference cell lines and the panel of six medulloblastoma cell lines derived in our laboratory from the primary tumor tissues of known molecular subgroups. Immunohistochemical detection of these markers was performed on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue of the matching primary tumors. The results revealed substantial divergences between the primary tumor tissues and matching cell lines in the immunoreactivity pattern of medulloblastoma-subgroup-specific protein markers. Regardless of the molecular subgroup of the primary tumor, all six patient-derived medulloblastoma cell lines exhibited a uniform phenotype: immunofluorescence showed the nuclear localization of YAP1, accompanied by strong cytoplasmic positivity for β-catenin and filamin A, as well as weak positivity for GAB1. The same immunoreactivity pattern was also found in both DAOY and D283 Med reference medulloblastoma cell lines. Therefore, we can conclude that various medulloblastoma cell lines tend to exhibit the same characteristics of protein marker expression under standard in vitro conditions. Such a finding emphasizes the importance of the analyses of primary tumors in clinically oriented medulloblastoma research and the urgent need to develop in vitro models of improved clinical relevance, such as 3D cultures and organotypic slice cultures."

Prolonged storage time of RBC may increase the risk. The primary aim of the study was to evaluate whether the storage time of RBC is associated with development of POAF.Pre-, per- and postoperative data were retrieved from the Western Denmark Heart Registry and local blood banks regarding patients who underwent coronary artery bypass surgery, valve surgery or combined procedures in Aalborg or Aarhus University Hospital during 2010-2014. Multiple logistic regression was used to determine the risk of POAF according to transfusion of RBC on the day of surgery. Furthermore, we determined trend in storage time of RBC according to risk of POAF using restricted cubic splines. Patients with a history of preoperative atrial fibrillation, patients who received transfusions preoperative and patients who died at the day of surgery were among excluded patients.A total of 2,978 patients with a mean age of 66.4 years were included and 609 patients (21%) received RBC transfusion on the day of surgery. POAF developed in 752 patients (25%) and transfused patients were at an increased risk compared with non-transfused patients (adjusted Odds Ratios for patients receiving RBC: 1.37; 95% CI: 1.11-1.69, P-value = 0.004). However, RBC transfusion was not necessarily the cause of POAF and may only be a marker for development of POAF. There was no significant association between storage time of RBC and POAF.In contrast to intraoperative allogeneic RBC transfusion in general, increased storage time of RBC is not associated with development of POAF in cardiac surgery."
