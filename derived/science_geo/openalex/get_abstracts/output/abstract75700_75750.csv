https://openalex.org/W1604536885,"1. A method is described for the primary growth of chick embryo liver cells on cover slips in culture, and the factors of the culture medium are considered that affect the induction of porphyrin formation with certain chemicals. 2. A method is described for following δ-aminolevulinic acid synthetase (ALA synthetase) activity by the determination of porphyrin fluorescence developed in the cells on cover slips after induction with chemicals or drugs. 3. A nonchromatographic method is described for the determination of δ-aminolevulinic acid and aminoacetone in the range of 10-8 mole. 4. With allylisopropylacetamide as inducing chemical, an 8-fold increase in the mitochondrial ALA synthetase of chick embryo liver has been found. No other tissue tested was inducible. 5. After induction, porphyrin increased at almost a logarithmic rate for the first 12 hours. 6. The inducing action of the chemical is reversible. 7. The half-life of ALA synthetase in chick embryo liver cells in culture is 4 to 6 hours. 8. The chemicals and drugs which induce a porphyria in the chick embryo liver cells in culture may be separated into four classes: the barbiturates which contain three chemical groups that can individually induce; the collidines which contain two chemical groups; the sex steroids; and a miscellaneous class. 9. Evidence is presented that the control of ALA synthetase in the liver is by feedback repression in which heme may be the corepressor. No feedback inhibition was found. 10. The site for induction is proposed to be a site on a repressor which is competed for by heme and an inducing chemical. 11. Hepatic porphyria is postulated to be caused by a mutation in an operator gene that is poorly responsive to the repressor. The delay in appearance of symptoms of this disease until puberty suggests that sex steroids are the inducing chemicals."
https://openalex.org/W1540116808,"Incubation of Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens with different geometrical isomers of linoleic acid indicated the specificity of the biohydrogenation system for linoleic acid or for a conjugated dienoic acid. cis-9-Octadecenoic acid, trans-9-octadecenoic acid, and trans-11-octadecenoic acid were not hydrogenated by this bacterium. The intermediates and products of biohydrogenation of linoleic acid were identified as a Δ9,11-cis-trans (or trans-cis, or both)-octadecadienoic acid and a mixture of trans-9-octadecenoic acid and trans-11-octadecenoic acid. When different positional isomers of cis-trans-conjugated octadecadienoic acid were incubated, various trans-octadecenoic acids were produced, reflecting the double bond positions of the conjugated diene substrates. The first reaction in the biohydrogenation of linoleic acid by B. fibrisolvens is the isomerization of linoleic acid to the cis-trans (or trans-cis, or both)-conjugated octadecadienoic acid. This intermediate is then hydrogenated to form a mixture of the two trans-monoenoic acids."

Measurements of the number and diameters of dendritic trunks gave larger values for the larger cell bodies. The discussion deals with the interrelation between cell geometry, electrical properties, and the reflex action of alpha motoneurones."

https://openalex.org/W1558525802,"Abstract 1. Crystalline chloroperoxidase is effective in catalyzing the iodination of or thyroglobulin when supplemented with H2O2, or with the H2O2-generating system, glucose-glucose oxidase. The iodination reaction is very rapid at low concentrations of iodide (5 x 10-5 m), and at low concentrations of (1 x 10-4 m) or thyroglobulin (0.33 mg per ml). 2. Iodide is rapidly bound as 3-iodotyrosine, 3,5-diiodotyrosine, and thyroxine during the chloroperoxidase-catalyzed iodination. After 60 min of incubation with thyroglobulin as acceptor, chromatography of a Pronase digest showed approximately 45 to 50% of the added 131I in the form of 3,5-diiodotyrosine, about 20 to 25% as 3-iodotyrosine, and 4 to 5% as thyroxine. 3. Since iodination of thyroglobulin occurred very effectively in the presence of only a single crystalline enzyme, the results suggest that it may not be necessary to postulate the existence of a separate tyrosine iodinase in the thyroid. Moreover, the formation of appreciable thyroxine in the chloroperoxidase-catalyzed iodination of thyroglobulin suggests that a peroxidase may also be involved in the coupling reaction in the thyroid. 4. The chloroperoxidase-catalyzed iodination of and thyroglobulin is greatly accelerated by 0.1 m chloride and bromide. The mechanism of this stimulatory effect is not yet known, although several possibilities are discussed. 5. Iodination of thyroglobulin and in the presence of chloroperoxidase is readily inhibited by low concentrations of antithyroid drugs and by naturally occurring reducing agents such as cysteine, reduced glutathione, and ascorbic acid. Results obtained with these inhibitors support the view that antithyroid compounds act as competitive inhibitors in the formation of organic iodine in the thyroid. 6. Excess iodide inhibits the chloroperoxidase-catalyzed iodination of and thyroglobulin. These results suggest that the antithyroid effect of iodide, observed under certain conditions, may be partly due to inhibition of thyroid peroxidase. 7. Chloroperoxidase is very effective in catalyzing iodination of insulin and serum albumin. 3,5-Diiodotyrosine formation was at least as rapid in the case of these acceptors as it was with thyroglobulin, but thyroxine formation was not as marked. These results suggest that steric arrangement of newly formed 3,5-diiodotyrosine residues in thyroglobulin was more favorable than in the other proteins for promoting the coupling reaction. 8. No evidence was obtained that 3,5-diiodo-4-hydroxyphenylpyruvic acid (DHP) is an intermediate in the formation of thyroxine during the iodination of thyroglobulin with chloroperoxidase. However, when free was iodinated with chloroperoxidase, evidence was obtained that DHP was involved as an intermediate. To the extent that the chloroperoxidase-catalyzed iodination of thyroglobulin serves as a model for the thyroid coupling reaction, these results suggest that DHP is not an intermediate in thyroxine formation in the thyroid."

https://openalex.org/W1582200530,"Abstract Ribonuclease A has been subjected to reaction at pH 8.5 with a series of homologous α-bromo acids and with iodoacetamide. At this pH, carboxyalkylation occurs predominantly at the 3 amino acid residues which have been implicated in the catalytic function of the enzyme: histidine-12, histidine-119, and lysine-41. The histidine reactions proceed at rates which vary from 3 to 25% of those observed at pH 5.5. The extent of reaction at the three positions is dependent upon the structure of the alkylating agent. In the reaction with bromoacetate, the derivative alkylated at lysine-41 accounts for the major proportion of the reaction products, while with d-α-bromo-n-butyrate, histidine-12 is the predominant site of alkylation. In general, the reactions at the histidine residues display the same stereospecificity toward a reagent at pH 8.5 as observed at pH 5.5; reagents of the d configuration favor reaction at histidine-12, while their l antipodes alkylate the 119-position preferentially. No selectivity for the optical isomers of a given reagent is observed for the alkylation of lysine-41. Alkylation of the enzyme with iodoacetamide at pH 8.5 yields a complex mixture of products of which, in the initial stages of the reaction, the derivatives mono- and dicarboxamidomethylated at lysine-41 are prominent. The three products substituted at lysine-41 that have been characterized, namely the carboxymethyl, the carboxamidomethyl, and the dicarboxamidomethyl derivatives, all are essentially inactive. The active site histidine residues in the carboxymethyllysine-41 and carboxamidomethyllysine-41 derivatives react with bromoacetate at pH 5.5 at rates, respectively, 0.8 and 0.25 that of native ribonuclease. The effect of the 41-substituent is in each case to depress the alkylation of histidine-12 in relation to that at histidine-119. These findings indicate that although the chemical modification of lysine-41 inactivates ribonuclease, it does not substantially inhibit the alkylation of the histidine residues which have been implicated as part of the active site of the enzyme. From the information currently available, a tentative working model has been proposed for the spatial relationships of the chemically reactive nitrogen atoms of histidine-12, histidine-119, and lysine-41 in ribonuclease."

https://openalex.org/W1602456507,"Abstract Formation and ionization constants have been computed for the 1:1 copper(II) complexes of glycylglycyl-l-alanine, glycyl-l-alanylglycine, l-alanylglycylglycine, and di-l-alanyl-l-alanine. The values reported are similar to those obtained for diglycylglycine. The visible absorption characteristics of the intermediate species are reported and are similar to those found previously for diglycylglycine. Optical rotatory dispersion measurements on di-l-alanyl-l-alanine show marked differences in behavior among the different ionic species, in particular, the presence of ancillary Cotton effects in the cationic and dipolar ionic species at about 235 mµ. In both the copper(II) and nickel(II) complexes, the order of the magnitudes of the Cotton effects around the visible absorption band is di-l-alanyl-l-alanine g glycyl-l-alanylglycine g glycylglycyl-l-alanine g l-alanylglycylglycine. The wave lengths of the Cotton effects of the copper(II) complexes are close to the position of the absorption band. In the nickel(II) complexes, the Cotton effects occur at 475 mµ, whereas the absorption maximum lies at 430 mµ. The copper(II) complexes of glycyl-l-histidine show well defined Cotton effects at the CuL and CuL- stage. Optical activity of the nickel(II) complex, on the other hand, appears only after further ionization, which may involve the pyrrole proton on the 3-nitrogen of the imidazole ring, to give NiL-, which induces a change in configuration from octahedral to square planar."
https://openalex.org/W1501728927,"Abstract Attempts to separate β-hydroxy-β-methylglutaric acid coenzyme A-condensing enzyme and thiolase from yeast preparations by density gradient centrifugation, chromatography, and electrophoresis are described. In each case, it was not possible to prepare by these methods condensing enzyme free of thiolase activity. The results suggest that both proteins have closely similar physical properties. Each enzyme can be inactivated independently of the other by treatment with various reagents. Trypsin and chymotrypsin partially inactivate condensing enzyme. Papain, on the other hand, had no effect. The prior presence of acetoacetyl coenzyme A protects the condensing enzyme from inactivation by trypsin and chymotrypsin. Thiolase is completely inactivated by trypsin and chymotrypsin. The presence of CoA prior to treatment with trypsin partially protects thiolase from inactivation. Papain inactivates thiolase about 50% in the absence of substrates, but in the presence of acetoacetyl-CoA the inactivation goes rapidly to completion. Heat treatment inhibits condensing enzyme but not thiolase. The presence of acetyl-CoA protects condensing enzyme from heat inactivation and at the same time makes thiolase somewhat sensitive to heat. In agreement with previous results, iodoacetamide completely inhibits thiolase and only partially affects condensing enzyme. The presence of acetoacetyl-CoA or acetyl-CoA prior to the addition of iodoacetamide gives almost complete protection to condensing enzyme and partial protection to thiolase. CoA did not protect thiolase from inhibition. These results concerning the effect of substrates suggest that conformational changes in both condensing enzyme and thiolase are induced by the substrates, acetyl-CoA, acetoacetyl-CoA, and CoA. Kinetic measurements on condensing enzyme show that acetoacetyl-CoA exerts a large inhibitory effect. At low concentrations of acetyl-CoA, acetoacetyl-CoA appears to act as a competitive inhibitor. In the case of thiolase both acetoacetyl-CoA and CoA show potent substrate inhibition. Specificity studies with various acyl thioesters indicate that the thiolase activity studied differs from the β-ketothiolase and mixed thiolase studied by Stern and Drummond (4, 18)."

https://openalex.org/W1545175065,"Abstract When the β-hydroxy-β-methylglutaryl coenzyme A-condensing enzyme system of yeast is incubated with unlabeled acetoacetyl coenzyme A and acetyl coenzyme A is labeled with 14C in the coenzyme A portion of the molecule, no radioactivity can be detected in β-hydroxy-β-methylglutaryl coenzyme A. When unlabeled acetyl coenzyme A and acetoacetyl coenzyme A labeled with tritium in the coenzyme A portion are the substrates, the resultant β-hydroxy-β-methylglutaryl coenzyme A retains the radioactivity. These results show that the thioester linkage of acetoacetyl coenzyme A remains intact during the condensation reaction. When the enzyme is incubated with [1-14C] acetyl coenzyme A, a protein-bound form of acetate can be isolated. Protein-bound β-hydroxy-β-methylglutaric acid could not be detected when the enzyme was incubated with substrates."
https://openalex.org/W198446309,"Abstract 1. Heat extracts of mature mycelia of streptomycin-producing strains of Streptomyces contain two compounds which, when incubated with arginine-guanidino-14C plus a crude enzyme preparation from S. griseus ATCC 12475 containing arginine : X amidinotransferase, give products detected as radioactive Peaks I and II. Heat extracts from S. bluensis var. bluensis, which synthesizes bluensomycin, a monoguanidinated analogue of streptomycin, give only Peak I. A number of Streptomyces strains which do not produce streptomycin and which normally give neither Peak I nor Peak II give Peak II after exposure during growth to added streptidine. Evidence is presented that Peak I is N-amidino-scyllo-inosamine-P and Peak II is streptidine-P. 2. Purified amidinotransferase preparations from derepressed S. griseus ATCC 12475 and S. bikiniensis, both streptomycin producers, and a crude enzyme preparation from S. bluensis catalyze the following transamidinations with chemically phosphorylated acceptor compounds: arginine : scyllo-inosamine-P, arginine: streptamine-P, and arginine : 2-deoxystreptamine-P. In each case only one amino group is transamidinated, with the respective formation of N-amidino - scyllo - inosamine - P, N - amidinostreptamine - P, and N-amidino-2-deoxystreptamine-P. Location of the single phosphate group is unknown. Treatment with alkaline phosphatase gives the corresponding dephosphorylated derivatives. 3. Crude enzyme preparations from S. griseus and S. bikiniensis catalyze incorporation of radioactivity from arginine-guanidino-14C into streptidine-P after a lag period which is eliminated following preincubation in the absence of arginine. Preincubation presumably transforms streptidine-P into the actual amidine acceptor, which can now react more rapidly with purified amidinotransferases and the S. bluensis enzyme. 4. A scheme for biosynthesis of the streptidine moiety of streptomycin, the bluensidine moiety of bluensomycin, and the deoxystreptamine moieties of kanamycin and neomycin is presented."

https://openalex.org/W1560953494,Abstract The cis and trans racemates of synthetic 3-hydroxyproline and of synthetic 3-methoxyproline were interconverted by an epimerization reaction at carbon atom 2. The interconversions are proof of the diastereomeric nature of the synthetic isomers. Assignments of cis and trans configuration were made from nuclear magnetic resonance studies. Synthetic cis- and trans-3-hydroxy-dl-proline were partially resolved by the action of prolidase. The l isomers were obtained pure and the optical rotation of the trans l isomer was shown to be identical with that of the natural imino acid. Thus carbon 2 of trans-3-hydroxyproline isolated from cattle Achilles tendon collagen is of the l configuration. The cis and trans racemates of 3-methoxyproline were completely resolved by conversion into and column chromatographic separation of diastereoisomeric peptides. The four 3-hydroxyproline isomers were obtained pure from the 3-methoxyproline compounds. Most of the criteria of acceptance of trans-3-hydroxy-l-proline as a new amino acid occurring in a protein are met.

https://openalex.org/W1636644833,"Abstract In the presence of catalytic amounts of the β-hydroxy-β-methylglutaric acid coenzyme A-condensing enzyme of yeast, substrate amounts of acetoacetyl acyl carrier protein and acetyl coenzyme A react to form stoichiometric amounts of protein-bound β-hydroxy-β-methylglutaric acid, which is apparently β-hydroxy-β-methylglutaric acid acyl carrier protein. The condensation reaction with acetoacetyl acyl carrier protein proceeds at about one-sixth the rate observed with acetoacetyl coenzyme A. β-Hydroxy-β-methylglutaric acid coenzyme A does not undergo a transacylation reaction with acyl carrier protein, but a nonenzymatic transacylation of β-hydroxy-β-methylglutaric acid acyl carrier protein to coenzyme A does occur. These observations agree with previous suggestions that the thioester bond of the acetoacyl moiety remains intact during the condensation reaction with acetyl coenzyme A and provide a basis for unification of the so called malonate and acetate pathways of β-hydroxy-β-methylglutaric acid synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1494159471,"Abstract A unique nicotinic acid degradation was devised which permitted the isolation of each individual carbon atom of the pyridine ring. Aspartate-3-14C and malate-3-14C were administered to Nicotiana rustica tobacco plants for 4 hours and found to be incorporated almost exclusively into carbons 2 and 3 of the pyridine ring of nicotine. When aspartate-3-14C was fed, 57% of the tracer resided at carbon 3 and 38% at carbon 2. Malate-3-14C labeled carbon 3 with 61% of the isotope and carbon 2 with 38%. The dilution of incorporation of aspartate-3-14C was 600 and of malate-3-14C, 1260. The incorporation of aspartate and malate with low dilution and the lack of randomization of 14C between carbons 2 and 3 of the pyridine ring indicate either that aspartate or malate is the immediate precursor of the pyridine ring of nicotine, or that they are converted to the immediate precursor without passing through a symmetrical intermediate."

https://openalex.org/W184338590,"Abstract The incorporation of labeled palmitate into phospholipids in bovine brain mitochondria was compared with fatty acid oxidation under various experimental conditions. The rate of incorporation of palmitate into phospholipids proceeded at 20 to 25% of the rate of palmitate oxidation under optimal conditions and required exogenous adenosine triphosphate and coenzyme A. The addition of coenzyme A was not necessary for fatty acid oxidation. In the presence of ATP, the incorporation into phospholipids was not affected by cyanide, dinitrophenol, or oligomycin, although these agents inhibited fatty acid oxidation. In the absence of exogenous nucleotides, oligomycin inhibited the incorporation of palmitate into phospholipids and stimulated palmitate oxidation. A preincubation with glucose and hexokinase decreased the incorporation of palmitate into phospholipids to a greater extent than palmitate oxidation. The addition of oligomycin after the preincubation further inhibited the incorporation into phospholipids but reversed the inhibition of fatty acid oxidation. These results indicate that in brain mitochondria ATP is necessary for the activation of fatty acids before incorporation into phospholipids and that high energy intermediates are not involved. It is suggested that the activation of fatty acids before oxidation or esterification may involve different energy sources and that these two metabolic processes may occur in separate compartments of the mitochondrion."
https://openalex.org/W1489686110,"Abstract Liver mitochondria from hypo- or hypervitaminotic-A rats exhibited low efficiency for coupled oxidative phosphorylation. Supplementation in vitro or in vivo with retinyl acetate, but not with retinoic acid, restored low phosphorus to oxygen ratios to normal. Uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation occurred with nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide-linked and non-NAD-linked substrates. Serum albumin added to mitochondrial suspensions from livers of vitamin A-deficient or toxic rats restored normal oxidative phosphorylation efficiencies. Tri-o-cresyl phosphate caused uncoupling which was not restored by the addition of retinyl acetate. An inherent instability of liver mitochondria from vitamin A-deficient and toxic rats is indicated because their endogenous oxidative phosphorylation is lower than that of mitochondria from normal animals. It is suggested that vitamin A is required in mitochondrial membranes at an optimum concentration; variations below or above this concentration cause these membranes to become unstable. Deviation from optimum may induce functional changes in enzymes associated with oxidative phosphorylation."

https://openalex.org/W1531371413,"Abstract A two-phase system in vitro has been developed for studying the bone-mobilizing effects of parathyroid hormone. Phase I consists of the incubation of hormone with ascites cells, and Phase II is the incubation of Phase I supernatant with dead bone powder. The mobilization of labeled calcium from this powder is the index of hormonal activity. The response to hormone is apparent at 10-8 m hormone, appears specific for parathyroid hormone, and has striking analogies to hormone action upon living bone in vivo and in vitro."

During brief hypoxia the changes in potential consisted of initial depolarization and subsequent hyperpolarization to near 70 millivolts. Depolarization occurred when oxygen concentration was reduced to a level of from 13 to 10 percent, and hyperpolarization occurred on reduction from 10 to 2.5 percent; there was yariation from cell to cell. The recovery of S-cell function from anoxia was fast in oxygen but slow in air. The results show that the S-cell stops functioning in seconds without oxygen; hence this kind of cellular element in the nervous system is much more sensitive to oxygen deprivation than other cells studied thus far."

Change in impedance did not always parallel precisely the changes in speecli sound level. Impedance changed during the initiation and dluring the course of the stuttering block.
https://openalex.org/W2058898984,Stable auxotrophic mutants of a group H streptococcus (strain Challis) were isolated on a modified Mickelson defined medium after exposure to N-methyl-N′-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine. Such mutants were transformed to both prototrophy and streptomycin-resistance and hence may be used as nutritional markers in the study of streptococcal genetics.
