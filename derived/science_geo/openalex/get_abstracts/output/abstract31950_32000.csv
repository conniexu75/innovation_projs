https://openalex.org/W2000759543,"The nuclear protein encoded by the proto-oncogene c-myb has been hypothesized to play an important role in the process of hematopoiesis, but direct proof of this function has been lacking. To address this issue, normal human bone marrow mononuclear cells were exposed to c-myb sense and antisense synthetic oligodeoxynucleotides, and the effects on hematopoietic colony formation and maturation were examined. Exposure of these cells to c-myb antisense, oligodeoxynucleotides resulted in a decrease in both colony size and number, without apparent effect on the maturation of residual colony cells. Exposure to c-myb sense, or irrelevant antisense, oligonucleotides had no such effect. These results show that (i) c-myb plays a critical role in regulating normal human hematopoiesis and (ii) the combined use of antisense oligodeoxynucleotides and hematopoietic cell culture techniques will provide a powerful tool for studying the role of proteins encoded by proto-oncogenes, or other specific genes, in normal human hematopoiesis."
https://openalex.org/W2043567784,"Retinal cells have been induced to project into the medial geniculate nucleus, the principal auditory thalamic nucleus, in newborn ferrets by reduction of targets of retinal axons in one hemisphere and creation of alternative terminal space for these fibers in the auditory thalamus. Many cells in the medial geniculate nucleus are then visually driven, have large receptive fields, and receive input from retinal ganglion cells with small somata and slow conduction velocities. Visual cells with long conduction latencies and large contralateral receptive fields can also be recorded in primary auditory cortex. Some visual cells in auditory cortex are direction selective or have oriented receptive fields that resemble those of complex cells in primary visual cortex. Thus, functional visual projections can be routed into nonvisual structures in higher mammals, suggesting that the modality of a sensory thalamic nucleus or cortical area may be specified by its inputs during development."

https://openalex.org/W1966552570,"Site-directed mutagenesis and expression in Xenopus oocytes were used to study acetylcholine receptors in which serine residues (i) were replaced by alanines (alpha, delta subunits) or (ii) replaced a phenylalanine (beta subunit) at a postulated polar site within the M2 transmembrane helix. As the number of serines decreased, there were decreases in the residence time and consequently the equilibrium binding affinity of QX-222, a quaternary ammonium anesthetic derivative thought to bind within the open channel. Receptors with three serine-to-alanine mutations also displayed a selective decrease in outward single-channel currents. Both the direction of this rectification and the voltage dependence of QX-222 blockade suggest that the residues mutated are within the aqueous pore of the receptor and near its cytoplasmic (inner) surface."
https://openalex.org/W2042714786,"The quaternary structure and functional properties of synaptophysin, a major integral membrane protein of small presynaptic vesicles, were investigated. Cross-linking and sedimentation studies indicate that synaptophysin is a hexameric homo-oligomer, which in electron micrographs exhibits structural features common to channel-forming proteins. On reconstitution into planar lipid bilayers, purified synaptophysin displays voltage-sensitive channel activity with an average conductance of about 150 picosiemens. Because specific channels and fusion pores have been implicated in vesicular uptake and release of secretory compounds, synaptophysin may have a role in these processes."

https://openalex.org/W2068665571,"The rapid induction of the proto-oncogene c-fos by growth factors and other bioactive agents, and the recent evidence that the c-fos protein (Fos) is associated with transcriptional complexes, suggests that Fos may represent an integral part of an intracellular messenger pathway that triggers changes in gene expression and ultimately phenotypic alterations. This report examines the role of c-fos in growth factor stimulation of transin, a matrix-degrading secreted metalloproteinase. Platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) stimulation of transin RNA was blocked by a selective reduction in Fos synthesis with antisense c-fos mRNA, whereas epidermal growth factor (EGF) stimulation of transin occurred despite an equivalent inhibition of Fos levels. The stimulatory effect of both PDGF and EGF on transin transcription involved factors recognizing the sequence TGAGTCA, which is found in the transin promoter and is reported to be a binding site for the transcriptional factor Jun/AP-1 and for associated Fos and Fos-related complexes. Thus both Fos-dependent and Fos-independent pathways exist for growth factor regulation of gene expression, and both effects may be mediated through the same cis-acting transcription element."

https://openalex.org/W1502130152,"We have examined the ability of transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) to regulate the expression of members of the αβ2 and αβ3 families of integrins. TGF-β1 elevates the expression of vitronectin receptors (αvβ3 integrin) in all cells examined including WI-38 human lung fibroblasts, 3T3-L1 mouse fibroblasts, and MG-63 human osteogenic sarcoma cells. TGF-β1 action increases the level of mRNA and the synthesis of vitronectin receptor subunits with t½of 3–4 h and 6 h, respectively. TGF-β1 up-regulates expression of the intercellular adhesion receptor, LFA-1 (αLβ2), in THP-1 human monocytic leukemia cells by increasing the synthesis of αL subunit but not β2 subunit. The increase in αl synthesis and assembly into LFA-1 complexes induced by TGF-β1 occurs in parallel with elevated fibronectin receptor synthesis in THP-1 cells. These responses to TGF-β1 are lost upon phorbol esterinduced differentiation of THP-1 cells into the macrophage phenotype. The results suggest a role of TGF-β in the regulation of cell-matrix interactions mediated by vitronectin receptors and cell-cell interactions mediated by LFA-1 in the immune system."

https://openalex.org/W1594881395,"Abstract We have employed photoaffinity cross-linking to examine RGD recognition by the human placental vitronectin receptor. The peptide GRGDSPK was coupled to a thiol-cleavable radioiodinatable aryl azide (sulfosuccinimidyl 2-(p-azido-salicylamido)-1,3'-dithiopropionate. When 125I-sulfosuccinimidyl 2-(p-azido-salicylamido)-1,3'-dithiopropionate-GRGDSPK was cross-linked to the vitronectin receptor in solution, 80% of the label was associated with the beta subunit. Cross-linking to both subunits of the receptor was highly specific and dependent upon the presence of divalent cations. Ca2+ and Mg2+ promoted RGD recognition by the receptor; however, the effects of each divalent cation were kinetically distinct. We have also identified and determined the amino acid sequence of chymotryptic and V8 protease-generated peptides of the beta subunit that were radiolabeled as a result of cross-linking. The results of these studies demonstrate that amino acid residues 61-203 are proximal to the RGD binding domain of the vitronectin receptor."
https://openalex.org/W1567815552,"Abstract Using density gradient centrifugation and [3H]ryanodine as a specific marker, the ryanodine receptor-Ca2+ release channel complex from Chaps-solubilized canine cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) has been purified in the form of an approximately 30 S complex, comprised of Mr approximately 400,000 polypeptides. Purification resulted in a specific activity of approximately 450 pmol bound ryanodine/mg of protein, a 60-70% recovery of ryanodine binding activity, and retention of the high affinity ryanodine binding site (KD = 3 nM). Negative stain electron microscopy revealed a 4-fold symmetric, four-leaf clover structure, which could fill a box approximately 30 x 30 nm and was thus morphologically similar to the SR-transverse-tubule, junctionally associated foot structure. The structural, sedimentation, and ryanodine binding data strongly suggest there is one high affinity ryanodine binding site/30 S complex, comprised of four Mr approximately 400,000 subunits. Upon reconstitution into planar lipid bilayers, the purified complex exhibited a Ca2+ conductance (70 pS in 50 mM Ca2+) similar to that of the native cardiac Ca2+ release channel (75 pS). The reconstituted complex was also found to conduct Na+ (550 pS in 500 mM Na+) and often to display complex Na+ subconducting states. The purified channel could be activated by micromolar Ca2+ or millimolar ATP, inhibited by millimolar Mg2+ or micromolar ruthenium red, and modified to a long-lived open subconducting state by ryanodine. The sedimentation, subunit composition, morphological, and ryanodine binding characteristics of the purified cardiac ryanodine receptor-Ca2+ release channel complex were similar to those previously described for the purified ryanodine receptor-Ca2+ release channel complex from fast-twitch skeletal muscle."

https://openalex.org/W1551410107,"Abstract Type 1 plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI-1) binds to the extracellular matrix of cultured bovine aortic endothelial cells. Bovine plasma and bovine lung extract contain protein(s) that bind to PAI-1 and prevent this interaction. One of these proteins was purified approximately 425-fold from ammonium sulfate-fractionated plasma using standard chromatographic procedures together with affinity chromatography on PAI-1-Sepharose. The final product consisted of a major polypeptide of Mr 65,000 and two minor polypeptides of Mr 80,000 and 57,000. NH2-terminal amino acid sequence analysis of the Mr 65,000 polypeptide revealed that it was homologous with vitronectin, and antiserum against this purified binding protein recognized vitronectin and vice versa. Immunological analysis using these antisera demonstrated that the three peptides were immunologically related, and that vitronectin was present in the extracellular matrix of bovine endothelial cells and also in bovine lung."
https://openalex.org/W1547925885,"GAP-43 is a neural-specific protein that is believed integral to neurite growth and to the plasticity of neuronal structure. Its gene expression is regulated in vivo and correlates with periods of axonal growth. We investigated the regulation of GAP-43 gene expression in PC12 cells, which are believed to resemble precursor cells of the adrenomedullary lineage. In these cells, nerve growth factor (NGF) increases GAP-43 expression, and corticosteroids decrease it. Corticosteroids diminish GAP-43 levels even in cells already differentiated by NGF, as well as in primary neurons of the superior cervical ganglion. Neither the NGF nor the steroid effect requires new protein synthesis. Nuclear run-on experiments show that the steroid repression is mediated at the level of gene transcription but that the NGF effect is likely to be posttranscriptional. NGF and corticosteroids are known to regulate bimodally the cell fate decision of sympathoadrenal precursors, with NGF promoting the neuronal phenotype and steroids promoting the chromaffin phenotype. The regulation of GAP-43 is consistent with the notion that this gene is bimodally regulated during these cell fate decisions."
https://openalex.org/W1590985692,"The interaction between human fibroblast collagenase and five mammalian alpha-macroglobulins (human alpha 2-macroglobulin and pregnancy zone protein, rat alpha 1- and alpha 2-macroglobulin, and rat alpha 1-inhibitor 3) differing in primary and quaternary structure has been investigated. Complex formation with each of these alpha-macroglobulins follows the course identified for many other proteinases, i.e. specific limited proteolysis in their bait regions inducing a set of conformational changes resulting in activation of the internal beta-cysteinyl-gamma-glutamyl thiol esters and covalent complex formation. At collagenase: alpha-macroglobulin molar ratios of less than 1:1 3.2-3.6 mol of SH groups appear for 1 mol of collagenase bound to human and rat alpha 2-macroglobulin and to rat alpha 1-macroglobulin. For these alpha-macroglobulins it can be estimated that the overall rate constant of complex formation is greater than 1.10(6) M-1 s-1 while it is much lower for human pregnancy zone protein and rat alpha 1-inhibitor 3. More than 95% of the complexed collagenase is covalently bound, and sodium dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis shows the typical pattern of bands corresponding to reaction products of very high apparent molecular weight. The same pattern is also seen in the covalent (greater than 98%) complex very slowly formed from Clostridium histolyticum collagenase and human alpha 2-macroglobulin. The identification of the sites of specific limited proteolysis in the bait regions of the five alpha-macroglobulins shows that cleavage may take place in sequences that are not related to those identified earlier in the collagens. These results greatly expand the repertoire of sequences known to be cleaved by fibroblast collagenase and suggest that this proteinase has a primary substrate specificity resembling that of the microbial proteinase thermolysin, as it preferentially cleaves at the NH2-terminal side of large hydrophobic residues. In addition, the results highlight the unique structure of the flexible alpha-macroglobulin bait region in that it can accommodate a conformation required by the highly restrictive fibroblasts collagenase. It is suggested that alpha-macroglobulins may play an important role in locally controlling the activity of collagenases and perhaps other proteinases of the extracellular matrix."
https://openalex.org/W1524553190,"We have previously shown that the fungal metabolite and immunomodulating agent gliotoxin induces apparently random double-stranded fragmentation of genomic DNA in a variety of cell types and double- and single-stranded scission in isolated plasmid DNA. The in vitro damage to plasmid DNA appears to be mediated by reactive oxygen species, but the mechanism of damage to genomic DNA is not yet known. In this paper we show that treatment of macrophages with gliotoxin and some analogues gives rise to discrete DNA fragments with molecular weight 170 +/- 30 base pairs. This pattern of DNA fragmentation has the characteristics of apoptosis, a programmed form of cell death. Three structural analogues of gliotoxin and two S-acetylated precursors capable of intracellular hydrolysis to the thiol form induce identical DNA degradation patterns. Only those compounds with the epipolythiodioxopiperazine (ETP) bridged disulfide structure or those capable of extracellular conversion to ETP compounds are equipotent with gliotoxin in their effects on macrophage phagocytosis, although all are capable of generating reactive oxygen species intracellularly. These results suggest that the effect of gliotoxin on macrophage function as assessed by adherence to plastic surfaces is unrelated to DNA damage and in addition suggests a new mechanism by which the toxin and other ETP compounds may damage cells."
https://openalex.org/W1964591585,"The expression strategy of the duck hepatitis B virus (DHBV) P gene, which is assumed to encode the viral reverse transcriptase, was investigated by mutational analysis. This study showed that P gene expression starts in the region where the P gene overlaps the viral core gene. However, in contrast to retroviral reverse transcriptases, which are expressed via gag-pol fusion protein intermediates, the DHBV P gene product was found to be synthesized starting at a P gene ATG codon. The resulting protein can complement polymerase-negative mutants in trans and can reverse transcribe viral pregenomic RNA that does not encode an active polymerase. These findings raise the question of how reverse transcription of cellular RNAs can be avoided in infected cells."
https://openalex.org/W1575637830,"P-450NF is the major enzyme in human liver involved in the metabolism of the calcium-channel blocker nifedipine. By screening a bacteriophage λgt11 expression library, a cDNA clone designated NF 10 with an insert length of 2.8 kilobases (kb) was isolated. This clone was sequenced and found to be highly similar in its overlapping section with sequences of two other cDNA clones previously isolated from the same expression library, NF 25 (Beaune, P. H., Umbenhauer, D. R., Bork, R. W., Lloyd, R. S., and Guengerich, F. P. (1986) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 83, 8064–8068) and HLp (Molowa, D. T., Schuetz, E. G., Wrighton, S. A., Watkins, P. B., Kremers, P., Mendez-Picon, G., Parker, G. A., and Guzelian, P. S. (1986) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sec. U. S. A. 83, 5311–5315). However, clone NF 10 had an extra 814 or 813 bases of 3′-noncoding sequence relative to NF 25 or HLp, respectively, and this additional sequence contained a second consensus polyadenylation signal. Specific oligonucleotides were synthesized to differentiate between these three clones at the mRNA level. Oligonucleotides specific to the protein coding region of each clone were found to hybridize to mRNAs of 2.2 and 3.0 kb in size at a ratio of ∼10:1. The major species of hybridizable mRNA was specific to clone NF 25, and levels of this mRNA could be correlated with levels of immunochemically detectable P-450NF and nifedipine oxidase activity in individual human liver samples. In addition, an oligonucleotide specific to the 3′-noncoding region of clone NF 10 hybridized only with the 3.0-kb mRNA. We conclude that alternative use of the second polyadenylation signal present in clone NF 10 results in production of the 3.0-kb mRNA species and that a pretranslational control mechanism is primarily involved in the regulation of nifedipine oxidase activity."
https://openalex.org/W2127398467,"Two different molecular species of protein methylases I (S-adenosylmethionine:protein-arginine N-methyltransferase, EC 2.1.1.23), one specific for myelin basic protein (MBP) and the other for histone, have been purified from calf brain to near homogeneity, as discerned by nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Although both methylases share some common properties, such as utilization of S-adenosyl-L-methionine as the methyl donor and methylation of protein-bound arginine residues, they are distinctly different from each other in molecular weight and in catalytic, as well as the immunological, properties. The MBP-specific protein methylase I (approximately 500 kDa) methylates MBP preferentially (Km = 2 X 10(-7) M) and histone to a much lesser extent (Km = 1 X 10(-4) M), while the histone-specific methylase I (approximately 275 kDa) methylates histone only. Both methylases exhibit two major subunit bands on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis: 100 and 72 kDa for the MBP-specific and 110 and 75 kDa for the histone-specific. At 0.5 mM p-chloromercuribenzoate, about 50% of the MBP-specific enzyme remained as active, while most of the histone-specific enzyme activity was lost. In 2 mM guanidine HCl, approximately 90% of the former enzyme activity remained while nearly complete inactivation of the latter enzyme was observed. The enzymes also exhibited quite different inactivation profiles toward high temperature (45-65 degrees C); MBP-enzyme was stable up to 50 degrees C and was rapidly inactivated at higher temperatures with an inflection point at about 57 degrees C. However, under the identical conditions, histone-enzyme was inactivated progressively and linearly in the same temperature range. Finally, Western immunoblot analysis of polyclonal antibodies directed against either enzyme exhibited no cross-reactivity with the other."
https://openalex.org/W1636959458,"Cyclic AMP responsive elements (CRE) have been identified in several genes, including those encoding the alpha-subunit of glycoprotein hormones and the cytosolic form of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) from the rat. Common to the CRE in these genes is the palindromic sequence T(G/T)ACGTCA. Based upon the strong conservation of this element, we hypothesize that the CRE functions by binding a protein that has been conserved across tissue and species lines. Scatchard analysis of gel mobility shift assays indicate that a nuclear protein in extracts prepared from rat liver and from a human choriocarcinoma cell line binds with high affinity to the cAMP responsive element from either gene (Kd approximately 10(-10) M). In order to identify the critical nucleotides within the CRE from these two genes, a series of oligodeoxynucleotides containing systematic mutations was synthesized and tested for protein binding and transcriptional function. Mutations within the palindromic core of either CRE resulted in a marked loss of binding to the nuclear proteins. Sequences outside the 8-base pair element were less important for nuclear protein binding to the PEPCK CRE and were not important for the alpha-subunit CRE. The relative binding, as determined by gel shift assays, correlated with the ability to confer cAMP responsive transcription to a viral promoter in transfected choriocarcinoma cells. DNase I protection assays suggest that binding of the nuclear factor from rat liver to the PEPCK CRE is more efficient when the core sequence is present in the intact PEPCK promoter regulatory region as compared to the isolated CRE oligodeoxynucleotide. Collectively, these results indicate that the nuclear factors necessary for cAMP induction of transcription of the alpha-subunit and PEPCK genes are conserved between tissues and species. In addition to the conserved features of these cis- and trans-active elements, nonconserved sequences and other elements of the promoter regulatory region influence the affinity of the protein-DNA interaction."
https://openalex.org/W1527111072,"Interleukin 3 (IL-3) is required for the proliferation of growth factor-dependent myeloid cell lines. To determine the possible signal transduction mechanisms involved in IL-3 growth regulation, we have examined the effects of IL-3 on tyrosine phosphorylation. Using a monoclonal antibody against phosphotyrosine, IL-3 was found to specifically and rapidly induce tyrosine phosphorylation of cytoplasmic proteins of 70, 56, and 38 kDa and a membrane-associated glycoprotein of 140 kDa. Minor and/or variable detected phosphoproteins of 120, 85, 51, and 28 kDa were also seen. Oncogenes encoding tyrosine protein kinases abrogate the requirement of factor-dependent myeloid cells for IL-3. We therefore compared the phosphoprotein profiles of a transformed, IL-3-independent cell line with the IL-3-induced profile. In cells transformed with trk, the 56-, 51-, and 38-kDa cytoplasmic phosphoproteins were constitutively phosphorylated, whereas the 140-kDa phosphoprotein was only phosphorylated in the presence of IL-3. Taken together, these results support a role for tyrosine phosphorylation in the IL-3 signal transduction pathway and suggest that growth factor abrogation by oncogenes encoding tyrosine protein kinases may be due to the phosphorylation of substrates which are normally phosphorylated in response to IL-3."
https://openalex.org/W2014877673,"The aminoacylation specificity (""acceptor identity"") of transfer RNAs (tRNAs) has previously been associated with the position of particular nucleotides, as opposed to distinctive elements of three-dimensional structure. The contribution of a G.U wobble pair in the acceptor helix of tRNA(Ala) to acceptor identity was examined with synthetic amber suppressor tRNAs in Escherichia coli. The acceptor identity was not affected by replacing the G.U wobble pair in tRNA(Ala) with a G.A, C.A, or U.U wobble pair. Furthermore, a tRNA(Ala) acceptor identity was conferred on tRNA(Lys) when the same site in the acceptor helix was replaced with any of several wobble pairs. Additional data with tRNA(Ala) show that a substantial acceptor identity was retained when the G.U wobble pair was translocated to another site in the acceptor helix. These results suggest that the G.U wobble pair induces an irregularity in the acceptor helix of tRNA(Ala) to match a complementary structure in the aminoacylating enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1568578844,"Osteocalcin (bone gamma-carboxyglutamic acid-containing protein) is exclusively produced by osteoblasts, which are the major target cells of parathyroid hormone (PTH) in bone. This study examined the effect of human (h) PTH(1-34) on osteocalcin gene expression in the rat osteoblast-like osteosarcoma cells ROS17/2.8. hPTH(1-34) increased in a dose-dependent manner the steady state levels of osteocalcin mRNA 2- to 3-fold with an ED50 of about 5 X 10(-10) M. This effect was detectable at 12 h, peaked at 24 h, and lasted at least up to 48 h. Forskolin, cyclic 8-bromo-AMP, isobutylmethylxanthine, cholera toxin, and (-)-isoproterenol similarly elevated osteocalcin mRNA. hPTH(1-34) did not alter the transcriptional rate of the osteocalcin gene, estimated by nuclear run-on assays, but increased the stability of osteocalcin mRNA. hPTH(1-34) also increased 2- to 3-fold the osteocalcin level in the culture media determined by radioimmunoassay. PTH, thus, promoted osteocalcin gene expression in these cells at least in part through mRNA stabilization via cyclic AMP mediation, a mechanism known only in few systems."
https://openalex.org/W1507420346,"Protein C is a vitamin K-dependent regulator of blood coagulation. It has beta-hydroxyaspartic acid in position 71 which is in the first of its two domains that are homologous to epidermal growth factor (EGF). This region has recently been demonstrated to have a Ca2+ binding site with a Kd of approximately 100 microM. Recombinant human protein C, expressed in mammalian tissue culture, had full biological activity and contained beta-hydroxyaspartic acid. Furthermore, it had a Ca2+-dependent epitope in the EGF-like domain, recognized by a monoclonal antibody. In contrast, a mutant recombinant human protein C in which beta-hydroxyaspartic acid had been replaced with glutamic acid in position 71 did not have the Ca2+-dependent epitope, and its biological activity was reduced to about 10% of normal. Fab' fragments of this antibody inhibited the anticoagulant activity of plasma-derived activated protein C, apparently by interfering with the interaction between activated protein C and its cofactor, protein S. The latter contains four tandemly arranged EGF homology domains. We propose that beta-hydroxyaspartic acid is directly involved in Ca2+ binding in protein C and in related proteins and that protein C interacts with protein S by means of its EGF homology regions."
https://openalex.org/W1514181378,"The membrane-bound form of keratinocyte transglutaminase was found to be labeled by addition of [3H] acetic, [3H]myristic, or [3H]palmitic acids to the culture medium of human epidermal cells. Acid methanolysis and high performance liquid chromatography analysis of palmitate-labeled transglutaminase yielded only methyl palmitate. In contrast, analysis of the myristate-labeled protein yielded approximately 40% methyl myristate and 60% methyl palmitate. Incorporation of neither label was significantly affected by cycloheximide inhibition of protein synthesis. The importance of the fatty acid moiety for membrane anchorage was demonstrated in three ways. First, the enzyme was solubilized from the particulate fraction of cell extracts by treatment with neutral 1 M hydroxylamine, which was sufficient to release the fatty acid label. Second, solubilization of active enzyme from the particulate fraction upon mild trypsin treatment resulted in a reduction in size by approximately 10 kDa and removal of the fatty acid radiolabels. Third, the small fraction of soluble transglutaminase in cell extracts was found almost completely to lack fatty acid labeling. Keratinocyte transglutaminase translated from poly(A+) RNA in a reticulocyte cell-free system was indistinguishable in size from the native enzyme, suggesting anchorage requires only minor post-translational processing. Thus, the data are highly compatible with membrane anchorage by means of fatty acid acylation within 10 kDa of the NH2 or COOH terminus."
https://openalex.org/W2064391986,Band 3 multigene family consists of several distinct but structurally related polypeptides which are probably involved in the transport of anions across the plasma membrane of both erythrocytes and nonerythroid cells. A novel member of this family of polypeptides that resides in the Golgi complex was identified with antibodies to Band 3. The Golgi antigen had a larger molecular size and was antigenically distinct from Band 3 in the amino-terminal domain. It was expressed most prominently in cells that secrete large amounts of sulfated proteins and proteoglycans. This polypeptide may participate in sulfate transport across Golgi membranes.

https://openalex.org/W1594157248,"The level of alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) mRNA in HuH-7 human hepatoma cells is elevated by the addition of dexamethasone to the culture medium. To locate the DNA region involved in hormonal regulation of the AFP gene, we constructed recombinant plasmids in which various lengths of the 5'-flanking sequence of the human AFP gene were fused to the CAT gene. Various cell lines were transfected with the recombinant plasmids, incubated with or without 3 x 10(-6) M dexamethasone, and then assayed for chloramphenicol acetyltransferase expression. In hepatoma cells that produce AFP, the dexamethasone treatment resulted in the stimulated chloramphenicol acetyltransferase expression when the transfected plasmids contained 169 base pairs (bp) or longer AFP 5'-flanking sequence. No dexamethasone effect was observed when the 5'-flanking sequence was less than 98 bp long. The dexamethasone stimulation was effectively suppressed by the glucocorticoid antagonist RU486, indicating that this effect is mediated by glucocorticoid receptors. The 71-bp region between positions -169 and -98 contains a nucleotide stretch which is similar to the consensus sequence of the glucocorticoid responsive element (GRE). Partial alterations of this sequence resulted in decreased dexamethasone response. The GRE-containing region stimulated heterologous (SV40) promoter activity in response to dexamethasone treatment in an orientation- and position-independent manner. The GRE and the upstream AFP enhancer function independently from each other."
https://openalex.org/W1511452332,"We have utilized oligonucleotide site-directed mutagenesis to test our prediction that Escherichia coli rho factor has an ATP-binding domain separate from its RNA-binding domain and similar to that of adenylate kinase. Single amino acid substitutions were generated in regions thought to be within the active site and catalytically important for the ATPase activity, changing lysine 181 and/or lysine 184 to glutamine, and aspartate 265 to valine and asparagine. The altered proteins were purified and characterized in vitro for RNA- and ATP-binding ability, ATPase activity, helicase activity, and ability to catalyze transcription termination. Our results indicate that 1) these amino acid alterations in the proposed ATP-binding domain do not interfere with RNA binding; 2) substitution of lysine 184 by glutamine actually improves the ATPase and related activities while the same substitution at lysine 181 reduces but does not eliminate activity; 3) the double mutation changing both lysine 181 and lysine 184 to glutamine eliminates ATPase activity; and 4) the aspartate at 265 is also required for ATP hydrolysis but not for ATP binding. These results are consistent with our proposal that the general tertiary structure of rho's ATP-binding domain is similar to that of adenylate kinase."
https://openalex.org/W1493270933,"Abstract Pharmacological analysis of in vivo cAMP phosphodiesterase in Xenopus oocytes using the nonselective enzyme inhibitors 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (IBMX), theophylline, and papaverine, demonstrated inhibition of insulin- and insulin-like growth factor-1-induced maturation at concentrations that were 17-60-fold lower than those required to inhibit progesterone-induced germinal vesicle breakdown. The abilities of the phosphodiesterase inhibitors to block the maturation response showed the same rank order of potencies for each hormone: papaverine greater than IBMX greater than theophylline. Insulin-induced oocyte maturation that was accelerated by 0.01 microM progesterone was also inhibited by low micromolar concentrations of IBMX, demonstrating that the accelerated time course was due to a synergistic potentiation of insulin action by progesterone. Both insulin-induced maturation and insulin-stimulated phosphodiesterase activity displayed similar sensitivities to inhibition by IBMX, suggesting that hormone-stimulated phosphodiesterase activity is required for the peptide hormone action. Furthermore, microinjection of the transforming ras gene product [Val12,Thr59]Ha induced oocyte maturation and stimulated oocyte phosphodiesterase activity by approximately 50%, and both of these actions were inhibited by IBMX. These results suggest that oocyte maturation induced by insulin, insulin-like growth factor 1, and transforming ras protein involves stimulation of a similar phosphodiesterase."
https://openalex.org/W1585415993,"A sucrose-rich diet stimulates the biosynthesis of very low density lipoproteins in rat liver. This diet also increases the triglyceride content of hepatic very low density lipoproteins and changes their apolipoprotein composition. To study the changes of hepatic apolipoprotein biogenesis in response to such a diet, we measured secretory rates of apolipoproteins A-I, B, and E in cultured rat hepatocytes. In cultures from rats fed the sucrose-rich diet the production of apolipoprotein E was increased 2-fold as compared to controls, whereas the production of apolipoproteins A-I and B was unchanged. The enhanced production of apolipoprotein E could be accounted for by a 2-fold increase in hepatic apolipoprotein E mRNA, as measured by slot blot hybridization. To characterize the mechanisms leading to the increase of liver apolipoprotein E mRNA levels we measured the transcriptional activity of the apolipoprotein E gene in a cell-free transcription system using isolated liver cell nuclei. Transcriptional activity of the apolipoprotein E gene was 7% that of albumin gene transcription in control animals. In rats fed a sucrose-rich diet the transcription rate of the apolipoprotein E gene increased to 140 +/- 11% of controls. There was no change in albumin gene transcription. Thus, a sucrose-rich diet enhances apolipoprotein E biosynthesis in rat liver, at least in part, by stimulating transcription of the apolipoprotein E gene."
https://openalex.org/W1582559821,"Serum mitogens, fibroblast growth factor (FGF), and type beta transforming growth factor (TGF-beta) suppress differentiation of the mouse muscle cell line BC3H1; however, the signal transduction pathways whereby these growth factors exert their effects on this system are unknown. The goal of this study was to determine whether the program for differentiation of BC3H1 cells was susceptible to negative regulation by signaling pathways involving cAMP or protein kinase C and whether these intracellular effectors participate in the mechanism by which growth factors prevent establishment of the myogenic phenotype. Exposure of BC3H1 cells to dibutyryl cAMP, 8-bromo-cAMP, or compounds that stimulate adenylate cyclase, i.e. forskolin, prostaglandin E1, and cholera toxin, prevented up-regulation of muscle-specific gene products following growth arrest in mitogen-deficient medium. Conversely, addition of cAMP to differentiated BC3H1 myocytes caused down-regulation of muscle-specific mRNAs. In contrast to the ability of cAMP to block differentiation, chronic exposure to O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate, the potent activator of protein kinase C, exhibited no apparent effects on expression of muscle-specific gene products. The proto-oncogenes c-myc and c-fos were up-regulated rapidly by cAMP in a manner similar to that observed previously by serum, FGF, and TGF-beta. However, these growth factors failed to increase intracellular cAMP levels, and they did not induce ornithine decarboxylase, which was subject to positive regulation by cAMP and O-tetradecanoyl-13-acetate. Together, these data indicate that differentiation of BC3H1 cells is subject to negative regulation through a cAMP-dependent pathway and that serum mitogens, FGF, and TGF-beta inhibit differentiation through a mechanism independent of cAMP or protein kinase C."
https://openalex.org/W1530045526,"A membrane-bound cytolytic pore-forming protein (N-PFP) produced by the pathogenic ameboflagellate Naegleria fowleri was characterized. N-PFP was solubilized from ameba membranes by detergent and enriched 300-fold by gel filtration chromatography. When analyzed by gel electrophoresis, N-PFP migrates with a molecular mass of 66 kDa and 50-54 kDa, under reducing and non-reducing conditions, respectively. In addition to lysing erythrocytes, N-PFP is cytotoxic to several tumor cell lines tested. Its hemolytic activity is not dependent on the presence of divalent cations. N-PFP rapidly depolarizes the membrane potential of microelectrode-impaled chicken embryo myocytes, suggesting that functional channel formation may represent the mode of membrane damage. In planar bilayers, N-PFP forms ion channels with heterogeneous unit conductances ranging between 150 and 400 picosiemens in 0.1 M NaCl and that are relatively resistant to closing by high voltages. Upon heat treatment (75 degrees C, 30 min), N-PFP forms channels with unit conductances that are on average larger than those formed by untreated N-PFP. N-PFP channels are slightly more permeable to cations than to anions. Using a liposome swelling-shrinkage assay, the functional diameter of N-PFP channels is estimated to range between 3.6 and 5.2 nm. N-PFP is immunologically distinct from the PFP/perforin produced by lymphocytes, the terminal components of complement and a PFP from the ameba Entamoeba histolytica, all of which produce pores on target membranes. This protein may have a direct lytic role during target cell killing mediated by N. fowleri."
https://openalex.org/W1557056177,"Two distinct forms of Ca2+ release from isolated sarcoplasmic reticulum vesicles in response to additions of heavy metals (silver and mercurials) are described. One form of heavy metal-induced Ca2+ release involves the ruthenium red-sensitive Ca2+ release channel localized in terminal cisternae. The other form of heavy metal-induced Ca2+ release appears to involve all portions of the sarcoplasmic reticulum and is insensitive to ruthenium red. This latter form of Ca2+ release occurs over a similar range of heavy metal concentrations as inhibition of the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ pump but does not appear to be a result solely of such pump inhibition. Both forms of Ca2+ release are inhibited by glutathione, an endogenous constituent of muscle fibers, and by dithiothreitol, agents which prevent sulfhydryl oxidation. To assess the role of any sulfhydryl oxidation in sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ release physiologically, dithiothreitol and glutathione were introduced inside muscle fibers and effects on excitation-contraction coupling examined. The results strongly suggest that sulfhydryl oxidation plays no essential role in skeletal muscle excitation-contraction coupling."
https://openalex.org/W2009006060,"Airway epithelial chloride secretion is controlled by the apical-membrane chloride permeability. Purified apical-membrane vesicles from bovine tracheal epithelium have now been shown to contain functional chloride channels by using the planar-bilayer technique. Three types of chloride channels were observed; a voltage-dependent, calcium-independent, 71-picoSiemen (in 150 mM NaCl) channel accounted for more than 80 percent of the vesicular chloride conductance and was under strict control of phosphorylation. The channel underwent a fast rundown in less than 2 to 3 minutes of recording, and reactivation required in situ exposure to a phosphorylating ""cocktail"" containing the catalytic subunit of the adenosine 3′,5′-monophosphate (cAMP)-dependent protein kinase. Mean open time and open probability were increased after phosphorylation, whereas slope conductance remained unchanged. Thus, metabolic control of tracheal chloride single channels can now be studied in vitro."
https://openalex.org/W1582252002,"Two monoclonal antibodies (2D3 and 4B4) have been raised against a stable cruciform DNA structure containing the 27-base pair palindrome of the SV40 origin of replication on one strand and an unrelated 26-base pair palindrome on the complementary strand (pRGM 21 x pRGM 29) and have been shown to recognize conformational determinants specific to cruciform DNA structures (Frappier, L., Price, G.B., Martin, R. G., and Zannis-Hadjopoulos, M. (1987) J. Mol. Biol. 193, 751-758). To define the region(s) of the cruciform that is recognized by these antibodies, we examined the ability of 2D3 and 4B4 to protect the single-stranded tips of the loops or the four-way junctions at the base of the stem of stable cruciform molecules against cleavage by mung bean nuclease or T7 endonuclease 3, respectively. Both antibodies were found to protect two of the four elbow-like structures at the base of the cruciform from T7 endonuclease 3 cleavage, but not the tips of the cruciform arms from mung bean nuclease cleavage. Also, predigestion of the cruciform with mung bean nuclease did not affect the binding of either antibody. In addition, 2D3 bound to a cruciform and a T-shaped structure involving the palindromic sequence at the cloning site of pUC7, which is completely unrelated in sequence to the palindrome of pRGM 21 x pRGM 29, and protected the base of these stem-loop structures against cleavage by T4 endonuclease VII. These results indicate that 2D3 and 4B4 bind at or near the base of the cruciform molecules and that, at least for 2D3, binding is independent of DNA sequence."
https://openalex.org/W1571413790,"Monoclonal antibodies have been generated to a chimeric peptide comprised of Escherichia coli beta-galactosidase fused to the amino acid sequence 69-207 of human preproenkephalin A. Two monoclonal antibodies, PE-1 and PE-2, were identified by their ability to recognize the same segment of proenkephalin A fused to the cII gene product of the E. coli bacteriophage lambda. The binding domains of PE-1 and PE-2 have been broadly located, with respect to the primary translation product, within the amino acid sequences 152-207 and 84-131, respectively. Immunoblot analysis of total bovine adrenomedullary chromaffin granule lysate reveals PE-1 and PE-2 immunoreactive forms of observed molecular mass 35, 33, 29, 24, 22, and 15 kDa, and an 18-kDa PE-1 immunoreactive form. Separation of granule membranes from their contents reveals differential membrane association of these high molecular weight polypeptides. There is preliminary evidence that PE-1 may be detecting a subset of polypeptides where shortening from the NH2 terminus has occurred. We postulate that the 35-kDa form represents the intact bovine enkephalin precursor of predicted molecular mass 27.3 kDa. This experimental approach should be generally applicable to the generation of antibodies which will recognize intact peptide precursors together with their post-translational cleavage products."
https://openalex.org/W2051668945,"Human fetal globin genes are not expressed in hybrid cells produced by the fusion of normal human lymphocytes with mouse erythroleukemia cells. In contrast, when lymphocytes from persons with globin gene developmental mutations (hereditary persistence of fetal hemoglobin) are used for these fusions, fetal globin is expressed in the hybrid cells. Thus, mutations of developmental origin can be reconstituted in vitro by fusing mutant lymphoid cells with differentiated cell lines of the proper lineage. This system can readily be used for analyses, such as globin gene methylation, that normally require large numbers of pure nucleated erythroid cells, which are difficult to obtain."

On Western blots, PM4A2B reacted with F1 and with ghosts, right-side-out vesicles, and inside-out vesicles prepared from erythrocytes giving one major band at 130 kDa and minor lower molecular weight bands whose intensity increased on freezing and thawing the membranes. On enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, PM4A2B reacted with inside-out vesicles, but not with the right-side-out vesicles or ghosts prepared from erythrocytes. It activated the ATP-dependent Ca2+ uptake by F1 and by the inside-out vesicles prepared from the erythrocytes. PM4A2B should be useful in determining membrane sidedness as well as in investigating the mechanism of the sarcolemmal Ca2+ pump."
https://openalex.org/W1497037902,"A new type of termination signal for RNA polymerase III transcription has been identified. A cloned DNA from salmon highly repetitive sequences, designated as Sm2, serves as a template for an RNA with about 140 nucleotides, but the clone does not have four or more consecutive T residues in the presumed termination site. S1 nuclease mapping analysis clearly demonstrated that termination occurred at the beginning of the AT-rich sequence in the 3′ region of Sm2. Studies with a series of 3′-deletion mutants strongly suggested that an AT sequence of more than nine nucleotides functioned as a terminator. Furthermore, results with another series of 3′-deletion mutants showed that a sequence of only nine nucleotides (ATATATATT) in the noncoding strand in fact functioned as a terminator (designated as the 9AT terminator), although with relatively low efficiency compared to a tract of TTTT introduced downstream, and that new cryptic termination sites were introduced in the upstream slight AT-rich region by approach of the 9AT terminator. An AT-rich region downstream from the actual termination site of Sm2 DNA may enhance the efficiency of termination by facilitating detachment of RNA polymerase from the template DNA. Since the nucleotide sequence around the termination site appears to be conserved in the salmon repetitive sequences, this new terminator may be responsible for the generation of a discrete-sized RNA transcribed from salmon total genomic DNA in vitro."
https://openalex.org/W1556937947,"Abstract Interferons, via specific membrane-bound receptors, induce various cellular functions of which antiviral protection is the most extensively studied. We have previously reported the existence of interferon antagonists (referred to as sarcolectins) in various tissue extracts from placental blood, cartilage, brain, muscle, or from sarcomas. These sarcolectins have been fully characterized and purified to homogeneity. In interferon-treated cells, they restore virus sensitivity 4-6 h after the establishment of antiviral protection. In the present study we investigate the effect of sarcolectins on the steady state levels of two double-stranded RNA dependent enzymes, 2-5A (p chi (A2'p)nA) synthetase and protein kinase. Several authors have previously emphasized the role of these enzymes in the mechanism of interferon's antiviral action. Interferon promotes a 4-8 fold increase in protein kinase and 2-5A synthetase in cells. Addition of sarcolectin 5 h after interferon results in a dramatic reduction in the steady state levels of both these enzymes, as shown by their decreased activity and yield observed in Western blot assays. The degradation of the antiviral response in sarcolectin-treated cells might therefore be at least partially attributed to a reduced synthesis of protein kinase and 2-5A synthetase. Since there are no direct interactions between sarcolectins and interferon or its receptors, it can be postulated that sarcolectins exert their effect through these interferon-dependent proteins. We postulate that the opposing biological effects of interferon and sarcolectins strike a balance which may, however, be modified in one direction or the other, depending on their respective concentrations."
https://openalex.org/W1556224168,"Abstract The platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) stimulated the phosphorylation of a nuclear protein of 64 kDa (pp64) in nuclei of nontransformed normal rat kidney (NRK) cells. Low levels of phosphorylation of pp64 were observed in nuclei of serum-starved NRK cells. Fetal calf serum (FCS), PDGF, and homodimeric v-sis and PDGF A-chain protein enhanced the incorporation of 32P into pp64 over 4-fold within 30 min and over 8-fold within 2 h of exposure of NRK cells to the growth factors. In contrast, constitutive phosphorylation of 32P-labeled pp64 in nuclei of NRK cells transformed by the simian sarcoma virus (SSV) was high and only minimally stimulated by PDGF and FCS. 32P-Labeled pp64 was isolated from nuclei of PDGF-stimulated nontransformed NRK cells; the 32P of pp64 was labile in 1 M KOH, and pp64 was not significantly recognized by anti-phosphotyrosine antisera, suggesting that the PDGF-induced phosphorylation of pp64 occurred on serine or on threonine residues. However, pp64 from SSV-transformed NRK cell nuclei was significantly stable to base hydrolysis and was immunoprecipitated with anti-phosphotyrosine antisera, suggesting that pp64 from SSV-transformed cell nuclei is phosphorylated also on tyrosine. FCS, PDGF, and PDGF A- and B-chain homodimers thus stimulate the rapid time-dependent phosphorylation of a 64-kDa nuclear protein shortly after stimulation of responsive cells. The growth factor-stimulated phosphorylation of pp64 and the constitutive high levels of pp64 phosphorylation in cells transformed by SSV suggest important roles for pp64 and perhaps regulated nuclear protein kinases and phosphatases in cell division and proliferation."
https://openalex.org/W1948336900,"Rhodanese has been extensively utilized as a model protein for the study of enzyme structure-function relationships. An immunological study of conformational changes occurring in rhodanese as a result of oxidation or thermal inactivation was conducted. Three monoclonal antibodies (MABs) to rhodanese were produced. Each MAB recognized a unique epitope as demonstrated by binding of the MABs to different proteolytic fragments of rhodanese. While none of the MABs significantly bound native, soluble, sulfur-substituted bovine rhodanese, as indicated in indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay experiments, each MAB was immunoadsorbed from solution by soluble rhodanese as a function of the time rhodanese was incubated at 37 degrees C. Thus, as rhodanese was thermally inactivated, conformational changes resulted in the expression of three new epitopes. Catalytic conformers demonstrated different rates of thermally induced antigen expression. Each MAB also recognized epitopes expressed when rhodanese was immobilized on microtiter plates at 37 degrees C. Two conformers resulting from oxidation of rhodanese by hydrogen peroxide were identified immunologically. All MABs recognized rhodanese that was oxidized with peroxide and allowed to undergo a secondary cyanide-dependent reaction which also resulted in a fluorescence shift and increased proteolytic susceptibility. Only one MAB was capable of recognizing an epitope expressed when rhodanese was oxidized with peroxide and then separated from the reactants to prevent induction of the secondary conformational changes."
https://openalex.org/W1550885395,"Antibodies to purified glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase were raised in rabbits and purified from serum by affinity chromatography on enzyme-bound Sepharose columns. RNA from membrane-free polyribosomes, or poly(A)+ RNA (total cellular RNA) of rat liver, was translated in a rabbit reticulocyte protein-synthesizing system in the presence of [35S]methionine, and the glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase synthesized was isolated by immunoprecipitation using the antibody. The in vitro product moved on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels as a polypeptide that was about 5,000 daltons larger than the subunit of the enzyme (74,000 daltons). Digestion of both the and the in vitro newly synthesized forms of the enzyme yielded respective sets of peptide fragments which had similar patterns upon sodium dodecyl sulfate-gel electrophoresis. When the presumptive precursor that had been synthesized in vitro was incubated with isolated intact rat liver mitochondria, it was converted to mature subunits that were no longer susceptible to externally added proteases. Import of the presumptive precursor is dependent upon an electrochemical potential across the inner mitochondrial membranes. The form of the protein is assembled in its native location (the outer surface of the inner mitochondrial membrane)."
https://openalex.org/W1535562726,"Abstract The miscoding properties of a 5-bromodeoxyuridine (dB) containing DNA template during in vitro replication have been investigated. 5-bromodeoxyuridine was introduced site-specifically into the amber 16 codon of a 25-mer oligodeoxynucleotide representing part of the sequence of phi x174am16(+)DNA. The dB containing oligodeoxynucleotide served as a template for in vitro replication by DNA polymerase alpha, DNA polymerase I (Escherichia coli) and AMV reverse transcriptase. The amber 16 revertant assay was used to detect the presence of misincorporated bases in the replication products. For all three DNA polymerases, the presence of dB does not constitute a significant barrier to replication. Errors at the position of dB substitution were found to originate exclusively from dGTP:dB mispairing during in vitro replication thus inducing A-T----G-C transitions. The dGTP:dB mismatches are formed at a 2-4-fold higher frequency as compared to dGTP:T mismatches. Our results indicate that the miscoding potential of dB-substituted DNA templates during replication is only weak at the specific site observed."
https://openalex.org/W1597459070,"Abstract Several recent studies indicate that substrates for ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis must possess unblocked alpha-amino termini. To examine further the importance of free amino groups for proteolytic susceptibility we selected pancreatic trypsin inhibitor (PTI) as a test substrate. PTI can be circularized to form cPTI, a molecule that lacks alpha-amino groups in the absence of an endoproteolytic cleavage. We compared the breakdown of radioiodinated PTI and cPTI in rabbit reticulocyte lysate and found that cPTI was not stabilized relative to PTI. In addition, proteolysis of PTI or cPTI was not inhibited upon conversion of their lysine residues to homoarginine. However, neither degradation of PTI nor cPTI required ATP, and ubiquitin conjugation to either molecule was minor relative to known substrates of the ubiquitin pathway. Thus, PTI and cPTI are cleaved by an ATP-independent endoprotease(s) that does not require the substrate to be ubiquitinated. Such an activity was identified in low salt fractions obtained upon DEAE chromatography of reticulocyte lysate. The ubiquitin/ATP-dependent protease and another large multisubunit protease, both of which elute from DEAE-Fractogel at higher salt concentrations, do not degrade PTI or cPTI. Although monomeric PTI was rapidly degraded in reticulocyte lysate, cross-linked PTI molecules were stable both in reticulocyte lysate and following introduction into cultured cells using red blood cell-mediated microinjection. Thus, increased rates of turnover do not necessarily correlate with greater molecular mass of the substrate."
