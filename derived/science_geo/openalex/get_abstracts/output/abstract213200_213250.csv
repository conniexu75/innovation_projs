https://openalex.org/W1963839308,"Three subclasses of human γ2-globulin (IgG) molecules were detected in normal human serum with antiserums prepared in monkeys. These subclasses, designated γ2a-, γ2b-, and γ2c-globulins, have antibody activity. The distinguishing antigenic characteristics of each subclass were associated with the heavy polypeptide chains and the F (fast) fragments resulting from treatment of γ2-globulins with papain."
https://openalex.org/W2029865749,A factor that lowers serum calcium and inorganic phosphate in rats has been purified 500-fold from 0.1N HCl extracts of hog thyroid glands. It is distinct from thyroxine and triiodothyronine and appears to be a polypeptide.
https://openalex.org/W2086724186,"A method has been found for inducing the rapid, quantitative, and relatively synchronous conversion of vegetative rods of a fruiting myxobacterium to microcysts. The conversion is induced by the addition of 0.5M glycerol to a dispersed, growing, liquid culture of Myxococcus xanthus. The vegetative rods are converted to microcysts in about 120 minutes."

https://openalex.org/W2046613624,The single-stranded DNA of coliphage X174 has been examined with the electron microscope by a modification of the protein-monolayer-adsorption technique. The molecules were found to be circular with a total length of 1.77 +/- 0.13 microns.
https://openalex.org/W2034150093,"Callus tissue, derived from petiole segments of the wild carrot and containing undifferentiated meristems, can be suspended in liquid nutrient media and passed through a series of sieves to separate the meristems by size. The small meristems of fairly uniform size thus obtained will grow on defined media where their controlled differentiation into embryos can be studied."
https://openalex.org/W2029407718,"Male and female rats of the Maudsley reactive and Maudsley nonreactive strains were tested in the open-field to obtain ambulation and defecation scores. They were later killed, and their brains were dissected into five portions and analyzed for serotonin. Males defecated more and ambulated less than females, and nonreactive males ambulated more and defecated less than reactive males. These behavioral differences were significant (p < .05). A statistically significant difference was found for the amounts of serotonin in specific regions of the brain between males and females (males higher) and between reactive and nonreactive males (reactive higher). Significant negative correlations between serotonin values in specific regions of brain and ambulation scores were found in these animals viewed as a group or even within a given strain and sex."
https://openalex.org/W1963831817,"Trimodal frequency distributions for isoniazid inactivation were found in Caucasian and Negro populations. The frequency of ""rapid"" and ""slow"" alleles in Caucasian and Negro populations was similar and differed from that of a Japanese population."
https://openalex.org/W1979054363,"Planaria which have cannibalized untrained planaria exposed to photic stimuli only, handling only, or previous conditioning, all require significantly fewer trials in a conditioning situation than naive planaria."
https://openalex.org/W2017140358,"The serotonin content of the pineal organ of the rat varies diurnally in relation to the photoperiod. When the sympathetic nerves to the pineal are interrupted by the removal of the superior cervical ganglia, no such fluctuation in the serotonin content of the pineal occurs."
https://openalex.org/W2044982978,"Boxfish under stress produce an ichthyotoxic, hemolytic, nonprotein poison in the mucous secretions of their skin. This heat-stable, nondialyzable ""ostracitoxin"" foams profusely in aqueous solutions and is toxic to various biological systems. It is apparently unique among known fish poisons; it is toxic to boxfish and resembles red tide and sea cucumber toxins in general properties."
https://openalex.org/W2045977563,Chromosome breakage was observed in human leukocytes in vitro when Schmidt-Ruppin strain of Rous sarcoma virus was added to the cultures. Similar additions of Bryan strain of Rous sarcoma virus had no such effect.
https://openalex.org/W1992809760,Continuous light impinging on the suprachiasmatic region of enucleate rats resulted in a constant estrous-like vaginal cycle. The lowest precentage of cornified cells was obtained from exposure of the arcuate or mammillary neurons to light. Ovarian and pituitary weight increased significantly after exposure of the arcuate region to continuous light.

https://openalex.org/W1997586197,Purified protein components can be recovered from high-resolution gel-electrophoresis patterns by elution-convection electrophoresis. The protein components are all simultaneously eluted from the gel pattern by horizontal electrophoresis and are then simultaneously concentrated by electro-convection to recover the proteins in nearly the original sample concentration. Thirty individual protein fractions can be recovered in 3 hours from a sample containing 200 milligrams of protein.
https://openalex.org/W2013629428,"Contours added to only one eye's view cause both suppression of the other view and loss of perceived depth. Since piecemeal contralateral suppression may be the general rule of binocular combination, the finding that suppressed views do not contribute to stereopsis raises basic questions about the nature of stereoscopic depth perception."
https://openalex.org/W1967713090,A nonprecipitable antibody to a haptenic group has been purified from equine serum. It is a 7S beta2delta immunoglobulin with high affinity for the specific hapten and two binding sites per antibody molecule. These results rule out univalence and low affinity as explanations of the nonprecipitability of this antibody.
https://openalex.org/W2029879243,"The learning of a brightness discrimination, discrimination reversal, and a simple oddity problem by rats was facilitated when the rats were given injections of strychnine sulfate after daily training sessions. Control rats injected with saline made significantly more errors during training on the first two tasks and failed to solve the oddity problem."
https://openalex.org/W2027445272,"Newborn ring doves were taken away from their parents when they were from 4 to 14 days old. They were then either raised by hand in complete visual isolation from other members of their species or placed in a community cage after weaning. They were tested as adults in a free-choice situation between human beings and ring doves. An optimum period for imprinting was found when they were about 7 to 9 days old. The controls showed that subsequent experiences during the life span of a bird also have an effect on the choice of a mate, and, in this species, imprinting can be said to be reversible."
https://openalex.org/W2006754347,"Habitual food carrying has been suggested as a possible major factor in making bipedal locomotion biologically advantageous so that it was selected for in early hominid evolution. This speculation, supported by slight observations of captive macaques, has now acquired greater plausibility from four recent independent reports of wild and semi-feral bipedal, food-carrying apes and monkeys from the Congo, Tanganyika, Japan, and a Puerto Rican monkey colony. The most striking evidence of the relationship between food-transport and bipedal walking comes from a troop of Japanese monkeys where the locomotor habit emerged as part of a chain of new behaviors initiated with a changed food supply."
https://openalex.org/W2002176525,Carbohydrate and protein fractions from the filtrate of a culture of Mycobacterium bovis strain BCG have equal activity in sensitive guinea pigs. The sequential action of two proteolytic enzymes caused little alteration in the reactivity of the carbohydrate but almost completely eliminated the reactivity of the protein.
https://openalex.org/W2029703642,"Electroencephalographic changes occur after small unilateral lesions have been made in the pontine tegmentum of cats with permanently implanted electrodes. Lesions in the area of the nucleus reticularis pontis oralis produce electroencephalographic synchronization (sleep pattern). Lesions in the pontine and caudal midbrain tegmentum, dorsal, lateral, and caudal to the lesions producing synchronization, produced electroencephalographic activation (waking pattern)."
https://openalex.org/W1979389752,Fragments of lymph nodes from rabbits hyperimmunized with human chorionic gonadotropin or bovine plasma albumin were cultivated in organ culture for 1 month. An anamnestic response was elicited in vitro by the sensitizing antigen. Phytohemagglutinin also produced such a response. Throughout cultivation the cultures showed excellent preservation of morphological integrity and of capacity to produce antibody.
https://openalex.org/W1985623516,"Electrical responses to ""white"" noise and tonal stimuli were recorded from unanesthetized cats with permanently implanted bipolar electrodes. The cochlear nucleus, inferior colliculus, and medial geniculate each showed distinctive patterns of evoked activity. White noise and tones produced qualitatively different types of response. A decrease in activity characterized the response of the inferior colliculus to tonal stimuli."
https://openalex.org/W1991837432,"Measurements with the voltage clamp technique demonstrate that only an early conductance increase occurs during spike electrogenesis of eel electroplaques. The delayed increase which is characteristic of spike electrogenesis in many other cells is absent. Instead, the membrane resistance increases two- to threefold above its resting value. The brief initial increase in conductance is due to sodium activation followed by rapid sodium inactivation. The influx of sodium causes an inward current of up to 80 ma/cm2. The inward current is abolished by eliminating the sodium from the normal medium (substitution of choline chloride for NaCl); by blocking sodium activation with tetrodotoxin; or by causing sodium inactivation through enrichment of the potassium in the medium. The delayed increase in membrane resistance is not affected by eliminating sodium influx, nor by substituting various impermeable anions for the chlorine of the normal medium. Thus, the increase in resistance signifies the occurrence of potassium inactivation which is unmasked by the absence of potassium activation."
https://openalex.org/W2018291310,There was a rise in the rate of drift of aquatic insects in a stream contained within an area of woodland sprayed with Sevin for control of the gypsy moth. It appears from the pattern of drift that there was a drastic reduction of the standing crop of stream insects as a result of the spraying.
https://openalex.org/W1980593283,"The incorporation of uracil-C(14), a precursor of cellular RNA, into whole cells of the sensitive parent strain Bacillus subtilis No. 6051 is completely inhibited by actinomycin D, whereas only partial inhibition of uracil-(14) incorporation occurs with actinomycin-resistant intact cells of B. subtilis strain II 15. Incorporation of uracil-C(14) into protoplasts of the resistant strain of B. subtilis is completely inhibited. The sensitivity of resistant-cell protoplasts to drug effect clearly supports the conclusion that actinomycin penetration is altered in resistant intact whole cells. Since other experiments have shown that the antibiotic is not broken down in the presence of resistant cells, resistance is considered to result from a change in cell permeability."

https://openalex.org/W2023054104,"Direct evidence is provided for the antigen binding activity of the 6S subunits formed by reduction and alkylation of rabbit beta2-macroglobulin antibody. Binding activity of the subunits was clearly demonstrated by radioimmunoelectrophoresis with a preparation of purified rabbit antibody against the p-azobenzenearsonate group, which contained 40 percent of beta2M-antibody. The precipitate arc formed between the subunits and sheep antiserum against rabbit macroglobulin was shown to bind radioactive antigen specifically."
https://openalex.org/W2005669849,"Whether initially exposed to a strikingly patterned model or to a plain white one, Vantress-cross chicks subsequently preferred to follow the striking model. Controls given the choice at the initial training age, and other (untrained) controls given the choice at the subsequent testing age, did not show a preference."
https://openalex.org/W2014698550,
https://openalex.org/W2037915705,Papain-digested rabbit antibody (Porter's fractions I and II) can neutralize poliovirus. Neutralizing capacity after digestion ranged from 35 to 45 percent of that of the undigested antibody. No definite dissociation of the antibody fragments from the virus was observed after the reaction mixture had been diluted in a neutral medium.
https://openalex.org/W2039634299,"If the association between chromosome aberrations and leukemia is a causal one, the aberrations should be present before the appearance of tumor. In a virus-induced murine leukemia in which the pre- and early leukemic stages were defined, aneuploidy was observed only during the later stages of the disease. This suggests that the chromosome alteration results from, rather than initiates, the neoplastic transformation."

https://openalex.org/W2093153015,"The placenta of the Indian elephant is incompletely annular and zonary macroscopically and occupies the equator of an ovoid chorioallantoic sac. The amnion is fused with the chorion over the zone. Microscopically, the placenta is labyrinthine and endotheliochorial with a rudimentary marginal hematoma. Both macroscopically and microscopically it resembles the placentas of thecarnivores, particularly the racoon, the cat, and the dog."

https://openalex.org/W2085419255,"Gamma-ray irradiation of polypeptides as highly dispersed fluffs under oxygen leads to chemical degradation of the peptide bond with the remarkably high oxygen consumption of about one molecule per 2 ev of absorbed energy. A radical chain mechanism appears to be involved, and there is evidence that excited states of the polypeptide aggregate undergo chemical quenching by molecular oxygen."

https://openalex.org/W2416234821,"The use of digital techniques in the biological laboratory is relatively recent (22). At present, computer equipment is extremely expensive by contrast with conventional electronic equipment. However, the costs are decreasing, and these techniques are rapidly becoming more accessible as well as more powerful. Improvement in the fabrication, size, and compactness of solid-state devices promises rapid progress in computer technology of interest to the biologist. Through the use of integrated circuits it will be possible to make general-purpose computers no larger than a laboratory oscilloscope, as compared with the present desk-size console with auxiliary cabinets. Within a decade the speed of computation will increase by an order of magnitude, and the costs will decrease significantly. Moreover, it seems likely that the parts of a computer and the laboratory ""interface"" will become available as modular units. An experimenter will then be able to assemble the components necessary for a particular application and change them as required. At present, one has to modify commercial equipment for the nonstandard, biological uses. However, with modular building blocks of relatively small size and more reasonable cost the digital computer may become as familiar a laboratory tool tomorrow as the cathode-ray oscilloscope or the spectrophotometer is today."
https://openalex.org/W2051850995,"Rats could press a lever to initiate or terminate a stimulus that was associated with intermittent rewards and punishments. Subjects spent time in both the stimulus-on and stimulus-off condition and oscillated frequently between the two conditions. This method provides continuous, quantitative records of oscillatory behavior and is sensitive to manipulations of shock intensity and food deprivation as well as the relative frequency of reward and punishment."
