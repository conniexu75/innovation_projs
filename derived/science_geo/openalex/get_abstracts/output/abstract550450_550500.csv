https://openalex.org/W2239118478,"Nucleosome positioning varies between cell types. By deep sequencing cell-free DNA (cfDNA), isolated from circulating blood plasma, we generated maps of genome-wide in vivo nucleosome occupancy and found that short cfDNA fragments harbor footprints of transcription factors. The cfDNA nucleosome occupancies correlate well with the nuclear architecture, gene structure, and expression observed in cells, suggesting that they could inform the cell type of origin. Nucleosome spacing inferred from cfDNA in healthy individuals correlates most strongly with epigenetic features of lymphoid and myeloid cells, consistent with hematopoietic cell death as the normal source of cfDNA. We build on this observation to show how nucleosome footprints can be used to infer cell types contributing to cfDNA in pathological states such as cancer. Since this strategy does not rely on genetic differences to distinguish between contributing tissues, it may enable the noninvasive monitoring of a much broader set of clinical conditions than currently possible.PaperClip/cms/asset/f03faa77-809d-4523-a491-244ac41d3bad/mmc4.mp3Loading ...(mp3, 3.26 MB) Download audio"

In eukaryotic cells, many of these forces flow through the collection of cross-linked, branched, and entangled filament networks that form the actin cytoskeleton (Fletcher and Mullins, 2010Fletcher D.A.

Cell Biol. 2005; 168: 441-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar). These dynamic actin networks are created by the branching activity of the Arp2/3 complex, which creates new filaments from the sides of preexisting filaments (Mullins et al., 1998Mullins R.D.

In addition to the Arp2/3 complex, assembly of force-generating networks requires two accessory proteins: a WASP-family nucleation promoting factor (NPF) and a filament capping protein (Akin and Mullins, 2008Akin O.

Cells construct actin networks by concentrating assembly factors at specific sites, establishing physical boundary conditions that dictate dynamics and architecture of the network. Filament nucleation and branching by the Arp2/3 complex, for example, creates actin networks that generate force to drive membrane movement (Svitkina and Borisy, 1999Svitkina T.M. Borisy G.G.

Because Arp2/3 activity depends on membrane-associated NPFs, new filaments are created only in a narrow zone adjacent to the membrane. Imposing this boundary condition on filament formation produces anisotropic networks in which most growing filament ends point toward the membrane (Maly and Borisy, 2001Maly I.V. Borisy G.G.

Isotropic networks assembled in vitro from soluble and randomly distributed Arp2/3 complexes are mechanically weak (Nakamura et al., 2002Nakamura F. Osborn E. Janmey P.A. Stossel T.P. Comparison of filamin A-induced cross-linking and Arp2/3 complex-mediated branching on the mechanics of actin filaments.J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9148-9154Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), while networks assembled from surface-immobilized NPFs are more coherent and much stiffer (Chaudhuri et al., 2007Chaudhuri O. Parekh S.H. Fletcher D.A. Reversible stress softening of actin networks.Nature. 2007; 445: 295-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar, Marcy et al., 2004Marcy Y. Prost J. Carlier M.-F. Sykes C. Forces generated during actin-based propulsion: a direct measurement by micromanipulation.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2004; 101: 5992-5997Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Once polarized, growing actin networks encounter obstacles and experience external forces that may affect their assembly. Here, we ask how mechanical forces affect the biochemical interactions that underlie network assembly, and we investigate how the mechanical history of self-assembling networks affects their material properties and motor activity. To measure molecular and mechanical responses of branched actin networks to force, we applied simultaneous total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) to actin networks assembled from purified components. To create biologically relevant boundary conditions for network growth, we micro-patterned the surface of glass coverslips with a WASP-family NPF. We then quantified incorporation of proteins into growing networks by TIRF microscopy. At the same time, we used an AFM cantilever to apply force and quantify network growth velocity. To understand the functional consequences of biochemical responses to force, we also used the AFM cantilever to measure material properties of branched actin networks grown under different physical and biochemical conditions. We find that force fundamentally alters the assembly, architecture, and function of branched actin networks: growth velocity decreases while filament density increases in response to force. Microscopically, the increase in filament density reflects two changes: (1) greater number of pushing filaments, and (2) tighter filament packing. Average filament length, however, does not change with force. Interestingly, the fractional energy of polymerization converted into mechanical work increases with applied force. Macroscopically, force on growing actin networks enhances their stiffness and mechanical resilience. Networks exhibit their maximum stiffness when loaded with the same forces they experienced during growth. These force-induced changes in material properties, however, do not scale with density or stress according to “universal” laws derived for isotropic actin gels (Gardel et al., 2004bGardel M.L. Shin J.H. MacKintosh F.C. Mahadevan L. Matsudaira P.A. Weitz D.A. Scaling of F-actin network rheology to probe single filament elasticity and dynamics.Phys. Rev. Lett. 2004; 93: 188102Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, Gardel et al., 2006Gardel M.L. Nakamura F. Hartwig J.H. Crocker J.C. Stossel T.P. Weitz D.A. Prestressed F-actin networks cross-linked by hinged filamins replicate mechanical properties of cells.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2006; 103: 1762-1767Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). This argues that the physics of Arp2/3-generated actin networks differs fundamentally from that of random, cross-linked networks. Furthermore, we find that assembling branched actin networks under changing load forces produces materials whose stiffness and force-velocity relationships are dominated by their loading history rather than molecular composition. To mimic enrichment of WASP-family NPFs on cellular membranes, we immobilized the Arp2/3-activating region of WAVE1 on functionalized coverslips (Fourniol et al., 2014Fourniol F.J. Li T.-D. Bieling P. Mullins R.D. Fletcher D.A. Surrey T. Micropattern-guided assembly of overlapping pairs of dynamic microtubules.Methods Enzymol. 2014; 540: 339-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar) (Figure 1A). We then added purified components—monomeric actin, Arp2/3 complex, and capping protein (CP)—to the WAVE1ΔN patterns to create polarized actin networks. To prevent spontaneous nucleation, we also added the actin-binding protein profilin (Pantaloni and Carlier, 1993Pantaloni D. Carlier M.F.

Bonder E.M. Coluccio L.M. Mooseker M.S. Actin from Thyone sperm assembles on only one end of an actin filament: a behavior regulated by profilin.J. Cell Biol. 1983; 97: 112-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). By confocal fluorescence microscopy, networks formed three-dimensional “pillars” growing from WAVE1ΔN-coated squares (Figure 1B) at 7.33 ± 1.61 μm/min (Figure S1A), at a rate comparable to actin assembly at the leading edge of migrating cells (Renkawitz et al., 2009Renkawitz J. Schumann K. Weber M. Lämmermann T. Pflicke H. Piel M. Polleux J. Spatz J.P. Sixt M. Adaptive force transmission in amoeboid cell migration.Nat. Cell Biol. 2009; 11: 1438-1443Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Growth velocity did not strongly depend on NPF pattern size, indicating that network assembly is not limited by diffusion (Figure S1B). Because <0.01% of the coverslip is coated with the NPF, network growth did not significantly deplete the pool of soluble protein components, and the filament networks grew with constant density and velocity for more than an hour (Figure S1C). The distribution of fluorescent Arp2/3 (not shown) and CP (Figures 1C and 1D) were also homogeneous throughout the networks.Figure S1Dendritic Network Assembly in the Absence of Force, Related to Figure 1Show full caption(A) Distribution of network growth velocities in the absence of load as determined by confocal microscopy for 56 networks from 12 independent experiments.

We used TIRF microscopy to quantify the rate at which individual molecules of actin, CP, and Arp2/3 join the growing network at the NPF-coated surface. We reduced the fraction of labeled actin to 1 in 1.5 × 106 molecules, which enabled us to visualize incorporation of individual actin monomers into the network. Each incorporation event was marked by the sudden appearance of a fluorescent spot within an NPF square (Figure 1E, top panel) that subsequently decayed exponentially with time as the molecule moved with the growing network out of the evanescent excitation field (Figures 1E and S1D; Movie S1; Supplemental Experimental Procedures). We counted single-molecule binding events and then divided their frequency by the actin labeling ratio to compute a total polymerization rate of 7,135 actin monomers-s−1μm−2 under our experimental conditions. Using this single-molecule approach, we also determined the total rates of nucleation/branching (68 Arp2/3-s−1μm−2) and capping (57 CP-s−1μm−2; Figure 1E, middle and bottom). The similarity of these rates indicates that most growing filament ends generated by NPF-stimulated Arp2/3 activity at the coverslip surface are also capped near this surface, within the shallow TIRF illumination field. We calculated the average filament length in two ways: by the ratio of polymerization rate to the rate of nucleation or capping (Figure 1F) and found that our filaments grew to a mean length of ∼300 nm (or 110 monomers), similar to filament lengths observed in branched networks in vivo (Vinzenz et al., 2012Vinzenz M. Nemethova M. Schur F. Mueller J. Narita A. Urban E. Winkler C. Schmeiser C. Koestler S.A. Rottner K. et al.Actin branching in the initiation and maintenance of lamellipodia.J. Cell Sci. 2012; 125: 2775-2785Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). We conclude that our reconstituted system captures the basic architecture and assembly dynamics of cellular actin networks. To measure network growth and to apply compressive forces, we positioned an AFM cantilever over an NPF-coated square before initiating network assembly (Figure 2A). To apply constant force to a growing network, we used optical feedback to maintain constant deflection of the AFM cantilever. We divide the cantilever force by the cross-sectional area of the actin network (200 μm2) and report our measurements as force per unit area or stress (pN/μm2 or equivalently, Pa). We first applied a stepwise series of increasing load forces to a growing network and measured steady-state growth velocity after the network adapted to the new growth force (Figure S2). This steady-state growth velocity fell sharply under small loads (Figure 2B) but did not stall completely until the load exceeded 1,250 pN/μm2, a value comparable to pushing and pulling stresses generated by crawling cells (Gardel et al., 2008Gardel M.L. Sabass B. Ji L. Danuser G. Schwarz U.S. Waterman C.M. Traction stress in focal adhesions correlates biphasically with actin retrograde flow speed.J.

Direct measurement of the lamellipodial protrusive force in a migrating cell.J. Cell Biol. 2006; 174: 767-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). The new steady-state growth velocity did not depend on previous forces (Figure S3), indicating that instantaneous force alone determines network growth at steady state. Finally, the force velocity curve does not follow a simple exponential decay as expected for a fixed number of growing filaments by Elastic Brownian Ratchet models (Peskin et al., 1993Peskin C.S. Odell G.M. Oster G.F. Cellular motions and thermal fluctuations: the Brownian ratchet.Biophys. J. 1993; 65: 316-324Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (723) Google Scholar). Instead, velocity falls sharply at low force but decreases more gradually at higher force (Figure 2B), suggesting a possible load-dependent effect on filament density.Figure S2Dendritic Network Growth by Atomic Force Microscopy, Related to Figure 2Show full captionHeight (red) and stress (black) as a function of time for a representative growing network.

(C) Actin fluorescence for a network (red) loaded at indicated stress (black) and an adjacent, unloaded control (blue) as a function of time. To determine the effect of force on filament density, we performed TIRFM of fluorescent actin incorporating into networks growing under load (Figure 2C). While growth velocity decreases with applied load, the density of actin filaments in the network increases strongly (Figures 2D, 2E, and S3; Movie S2). This increased filament density does not reflect elastic compression but rather stable, force-induced changes in the material (see next section). The fall in growth velocity and the rise in filament density nearly compensate each other, adding up to a surprisingly weak, load-dependent decrease in the rate of actin incorporation (flux) into the network (Figure 2F). Using our single-molecule measurement of actin polymerization under low growth force (Figure 1E) as calibration, we calculated assembly rates and filament densities for networks grown under other loading conditions (right y axes, Figures 2F and 2E). Over the functional force range—from zero load to network stall—filament concentration in the network increases from 0.125 mM to 1 mM (filament volume fractions of 0.5%–3.7%). From basic thermodynamics (Hill and Kirschner, 1982Hill T.L. Kirschner M.W. Bioenergetics and kinetics of microtubule and actin filament assembly-disassembly.Int. Rev. Cytol. 1982; 78: 1-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar), we estimated the free energy change of one actin monomer adding to the barbed end of a filament under our experimental conditions (Supplemental Experimental Procedures). Multiplying this value by the actin flux yields the rate of energy consumption by the network as it pushes against various loads (Figure 2G). We used the force-velocity relationship of our branched networks (Figure 2B) to calculate the mechanical power output (product of force and growth velocity) at each force (Figure 2G). The ratio of the power output to the energy consumption rate yields the efficiency of the branched actin network as a motor (Figure 2H). This efficiency turns out to be highly load-dependent, increasing from ∼3% at low force to ∼14% at high force. Thus, polymerizing filaments appear to share their burden more evenly under high load, with fewer futile polymerization events occurring away from the network/load boundary. We find that force increases filament density in branched actin networks, but does this reflect (1) more polymerizing filaments, (2) a shift in network microstructure to denser packing, or (3) both (Figure 3A)? To determine whether load increases the number of polymerizing filaments, we developed an “arrest-and-label” method to visualize free filament ends in the network (Figure S4). Briefly, we assembled two dendritic networks side-by-side: one unloaded and one growing against defined load. We then arrested network assembly by adding Phalloidin and Latrunculin B, together with a fluorescent derivative of CP (Figure 3B). The two small-molecules rapidly freeze actin dynamics (Akin and Mullins, 2008Akin O. Mullins R.D.

https://openalex.org/W2236887022,"Phagocytosis is initiated by lateral clustering of receptors, which in turn activates Src-family kinases (SFKs). Activation of SFKs requires depletion of tyrosine phosphatases from the area of particle engagement. We investigated how the major phosphatase CD45 is excluded from contact sites, using single-molecule tracking. The mobility of CD45 increased markedly upon engagement of Fcγ receptors. While individual CD45 molecules moved randomly, they were displaced from the advancing phagocytic cup by an expanding diffusional barrier. By micropatterning IgG, the ligand of Fcγ receptors, we found that the barrier extended well beyond the perimeter of the receptor-ligand engagement zone. Second messengers generated by Fcγ receptors activated integrins, which formed an actin-tethered diffusion barrier that excluded CD45. The expanding integrin wave facilitates the zippering of Fcγ receptors onto the target and integrates the information from sparse receptor-ligand complexes, coordinating the progression and ultimate closure of the phagocytic cup."

Using immunofluorescence, live imaging, genetics, cell-cycle analyses, in utero lentiviral transduction, and lineage-tracing, we show that in developing hair buds, SCs are born from asymmetric divisions that differentially display WNT and SHH signaling. Displaced WNTlo suprabasal daughters become SCs that respond to paracrine SHH and symmetrically expand. By contrast, basal daughters remain WNThi. They express but do not respond to SHH and hence maintain slow-cycling, asymmetric divisions. Over time, they become short-lived progenitors, generating differentiating daughters rather than SCs. Thus, in contrast to an established niche that harbors a fixed SC pool whose expelled progeny differentiate, asymmetric divisions first specify and displace early SCs into an environment conducive to expansion and later restrict their numbers by switching asymmetric fates.

Adult tissues are maintained and repaired by resident stem cells (SCs), which are capable of long-lived self-renewal and differentiation into one or more cell types. SC behavior depends on signals received from neighboring differentiated cells—referred to as the “niche” (Scadden, 2014Scadden D.T. Nice neighborhood: emerging concepts of the stem cell niche.Cell. 2014; 157: 41-50Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar, Schofield, 1978Schofield R. The relationship between the spleen colony-forming cell and the haemopoietic stem cell.Blood Cells. 1978; 4: 7-25PubMed Google Scholar). As recent studies have shown, SC niche components can include SC progeny as well as heterologous cell types (Hsu et al., 2011Hsu Y.C. Pasolli H.A. Fuchs E. Dynamics between stem cells, niche, and progeny in the hair follicle.Cell. 2011; 144: 92-105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar, Hsu et al., 2014Hsu Y.C. Li L. Fuchs E.

Tata P.R. Law B.M. Saez B. Chow R.Dz. Prabhu M. Gridley T. Rajagopal J. Parent stem cells can serve as niches for their daughter cells.Nature. 2015; 523: 597-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). In this niche-centric view, the microenvironment provides the requisite signals, such that, upon exit from the niche, “stemness signals” are no longer received in sufficient doses, and the cells acquire a different fate. In this manner, the number of SCs is predicated on both the signals and the numbers of available positions within a pre-existing niche. The overarching importance of the niche in maintaining SC identity and number inspires the question of how SCs are specified during development. In the majority of described models, SC establishment relies on signals emanating from a pre-established niche. In Drosophila gonads, the SC niche acts as a signaling center to recruit and maintain germ SCs from among a small population of undifferentiated primordial germ cells (PGCs) (Dansereau and Lasko, 2008Dansereau D.A. Lasko P. The development of germline stem cells in Drosophila.Methods Mol. Biol. 2008; 450: 3-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). PGCs outside of the niche directly enter cyst (females) or gonialblast (males) differentiation pathways (Bhat and Schedl, 1997Bhat K.M. Schedl P.

Clonal expansion of ovarian germline stem cells during niche formation in Drosophila.Development. 2003; 130: 2579-2588Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). In the developing intestine, cells expressing SC marker LGR5 are initially present throughout the epithelium. They become confined to the crypt base as the villus buckles, thereby concentrating differentiation signals within the upper tip region (Shyer et al., 2015Shyer A.E. Huycke T.R. Lee C. Mahadevan L. Tabin C.J. Bending gradients: how the intestinal stem cell gets its home.Cell. 2015; 161: 569-580Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). These examples demonstrate how existence of a niche can determine the location and number of SCs. An intriguing question still unaddressed is whether SCs are formed prior to niche establishment. If so, there must be some alternative way in which their identity and numbers are controlled. The hair follicle (HF) is an excellent system in which to explore these questions. Skin begins as one layer of unspecified epidermal progenitors. In mice, from embryonic day E14.5 to birth, hair placodes emerge in waves of spatially patterned cell clusters within the basal-epidermal plane. Canonical WNT-signaling, mediated by β-catenin and LEF1, is essential for placode formation (Andl et al., 2002Andl T. Reddy S.T. Gaddapara T. Millar S.E.

Development of several organs that require inductive epithelial-mesenchymal interactions is impaired in LEF-1-deficient mice.Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2691-2703Crossref PubMed Scopus (821) Google Scholar). The initial step appears to take place in the absence of cell divisions, as WNT-signaling epidermal cells cluster within the basal plane (Ahtiainen et al., 2014Ahtiainen L. Lefebvre S. Lindfors P.H. Renvoisé E. Shirokova V. Vartiainen M.K. Thesleff I. Mikkola M.L. Directional cell migration, but not proliferation, drives hair placode morphogenesis.Dev. Cell. 2014; 28: 588-602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Other than established links to both WNT- and SHH-signaling, it is unclear how molecular and cellular diversity are then generated as the placode grows downward to form a bud (hair germ). While both signals occur within the bud, SHH-signaling is genetically downstream of WNT-signaling, as it still occurs when SHH is absent, even though hair buds but do not progress further (Jamora et al., 2003Jamora C.

Shh maintains dermal papilla identity and hair morphogenesis via a Noggin-Shh regulatory loop.Genes Dev. 2012; 26: 1235-1246Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Lineage tracing has established that a pool of slow-cycling cells with molecular characteristics of adult HFSCs exists as early as E18.5, at a stage when developing HFs are nearing maturity and their “bulge” niche within the outer root sheath (ORS) has formed (Nowak et al., 2008Nowak J.A. Polak L. Pasolli H.A. Fuchs E. Hair follicle stem cells are specified and function in early skin morphogenesis.Cell Stem Cell. 2008; 3: 33-43Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). At first glance, this result would seem to support the pre-formed niche hypothesis for SC establishment. However, recent epigenetic studies suggest that, although the niche microenvironment dictates many molecular features of SCs, SCs can survive outside their niche if they can adapt their chromatin landscape to a new microenvironment (Adam et al., 2015Adam R.C. Yang H. Rockowitz S. Larsen S.B. Nikolova M. Oristian D.S. Polak L. Kadaja M. Asare A. Zheng D. Fuchs E. Pioneer factors govern super-enhancer dynamics in stem cell plasticity and lineage choice.Nature. 2015; 521: 366-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). In this regard, only a few markers of SCs in their native niche may actually be essential for SC identity. For adult HFSCs, the key to retaining stemness outside the bulge is SOX9 (Adam et al., 2015Adam R.C. Yang H. Rockowitz S. Larsen S.B. Nikolova M. Oristian D.S. Polak L. Kadaja M. Asare A. Zheng D. Fuchs E. Pioneer factors govern super-enhancer dynamics in stem cell plasticity and lineage choice.Nature. 2015; 521: 366-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Intermediate levels of SOX9 characteristic of wound-repair and cell culture are insufficient to sustain the cohort of other genes expressed by HFSCs in their niche. However, these levels are enough to endow SCs with plasticity and enable them to adopt either epidermal or HF fates. Since SOX9 is first expressed during epithelial budding in the absence of the full regalia of bulge HFSC markers, we speculated that HFSC specification might occur at this early stage. If so, specification would occur long before niche establishment. In this study, we examine how molecular and cellular diversity is generated within the hair germ and explore roles that WNTs and SHH play in SC specification and in balancing proliferation and differentiation at a time before the niche has been established. Unexpectedly, we find that the earliest divisions within the established WNThi placode are exclusively perpendicular to the underlying basement membrane. Using genetic mosaic approaches, we provide compelling evidence that the purpose of these perpendicular divisions within the native placode is to place one daughter outside of its WNThi parent cell environment. Using live imaging, whole-mount immunofluorescence microscopy and short-term lineage tracing, we further show that these divisions achieve asymmetrically partitioned WNT- and SHH-signaling, establishing a discrete molecular platform for two cell fates to emerge. Hitherto unappreciated, the displaced WNTlo suprabasal daughter becomes a SC progenitor that expresses SOX9. Moreover, although the WNThi basal parent is the source of SHH, only its WNTlo suprabasal daughter can respond. Intriguingly, the SOX9+ SC daughter undergoes rapid symmetric divisions, which appear to be SHH-dependent, while the basal parent continues to divide slowly and asymmetrically, a process that appears to be associated with its WNThi state. This progression differs markedly from a pre-established niche, in which hub vacancies govern whether SCs will proliferate. Importantly, and again in contrast to a pre-established niche, in which niche site occupancy dictates the maximum number of SCs, here, early HFs use different means to halt SC production. As WNThi parents mature into short-lived progeny, their slow-cycling asymmetric divisions shift, and instead of spawning SC daughters, they start to generate differentiating daughters. Overall, our findings show that SCs can be born by displacement from their parental environment during morphogenesis and reveal how asymmetric distribution of WNT and SHH signaling and their mutual antagonism are used in the niche’s place to govern SC specification and balance proliferation and differentiation. To understand how cell fates are specified in early HF morphogenesis, we investigated the first cell divisions that occur following placode formation. Immunolabeling for acetylated tubulin decorated the stable spindle microtubules and the cleavage furrow of mitotic cells, and P-cadherin (Pcad) distinguished placodes from interfollicular epidermis (IFE). Unexpectedly, nearly all mitotic spindles within (Pcadhi) hair placodes were oriented perpendicular (>45° angle) to the underlying basement membrane (Figure 1A). Quantitative analysis of an additional cleavage furrow marker, survivin, was suggestive of a perpendicular bias of late-stage mitotic division planes within these early stages of epithelial budding (Figure 1B). Hitherto overlooked, the nearly exclusive perpendicular angling further distinguished hair placodes from IFE, where such perpendicular spindles are fewer and have been linked to early steps involved in forming the skin barrier (Clayton et al., 2007Clayton E. Doupé D.P. Klein A.M. Winton D.J. Simons B.D. Jones P.H.

Ratliff L.A. Postiglione M.P. Knoblich J.A. Fuchs E. Par3-mInsc and Gαi3 cooperate to promote oriented epidermal cell divisions through LGN.Nat. Cell Biol. 2014; 16: 758-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). To ascertain whether perpendicular spindle orientations resolve into basal and suprabasal daughters, we developed a method to perform 4D video-microscopy on immobilized, ex utero E14.5 mouse embryos whose epidermis expressed a fluorescently tagged histone gene (Krt14-H2BGFP). Placodes were readily identified by their tight cell packing and hexagonal organization (Figure 1C). In total, we measured relative positions of daughters from 322 basal placode divisions (Movie S1). Parallel divisions were largely confined to IFE (Figure 1D; Movie S2). By contrast, divisions within placodes were nearly exclusively vertical, leaving one daughter at –3 μm and one daughter at +6 μm relative to the basal plane (Figure 1E; Movie S3). Together, these data showed that perpendicular spindle orientations within the skin result in a basal daughter that remains attached to the basement membrane and a suprabasal daughter that is born unattached (Figure 1E, schematic). Our movies corroborated our spindle axis measurements and showed an equal proportion of parallel and perpendicular divisions in basal IFE, but almost exclusively perpendicular divisions in basal placodes (Figure 1F). Whole-mount immunofluorescence of late-stage mitoses within placodes revealed that basal daughters differentially inherited Pcad, indicating that these perpendicular divisions are asymmetric (Figures 2A and 2B ). LGN binds to Gαi, links mitotic spindles to the apical PAR3/aPKC complex, and promotes asymmetric divisions in IFE (Williams et al., 2011Williams S.E. Beronja S. Pasolli H.A. Fuchs E. Asymmetric cell divisions promote Notch-dependent epidermal differentiation.Nature. 2011; 470: 353-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar, Williams et al., 2014Williams S.E. Ratliff L.A. Postiglione M.P. Knoblich J.A. Fuchs E. Par3-mInsc and Gαi3 cooperate to promote oriented epidermal cell divisions through LGN.Nat. Cell Biol. 2014; 16: 758-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Interestingly, LGN was also localized apically in perpendicular, late-stage mitotic placode cells, resulting in its asymmetric distribution to suprabasal daughters (Figure 2C). Since WNT-signaling is high in placodes and required for their formation, we monitored its fate when placode cells begin to divide. Surprisingly, only basal daughters exhibited intense nuclear LEF1, suggestive of active, short-range WNT-signaling. Strong basal activity of WNT-reporter Axin2-LacZ (Lustig et al., 2002Lustig B. Jerchow B. Sachs M. Weiler S. Pietsch T. Karsten U. van de Wetering M. Clevers H. Schlag P.M. Birchmeier W. Behrens J. Negative feedback loop of Wnt signaling through upregulation of conductin/axin2 in colorectal and liver tumors.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 1184-1193Crossref PubMed Scopus (839) Google Scholar) confirmed that WNT-signaling was high/retained by daughters that remained attached to underlying basement membrane (Figure 2D). Furthermore, activated focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and β1-integrin concentrated on the basement membrane-associated side of WNThi basal placode cells (Figure 2E). The ability of activated FAK to phosphorylate and inactivate GSK3β (Gao et al., 2015Gao C. Chen G. Kuan S.F. Zhang D.H. Schlaepfer D.D. Hu J. FAK/PYK2 promotes the Wnt/β-catenin pathway and intestinal tumorigenesis by phosphorylating GSK3β.eLife. 2015; 4: e10072Google Scholar) should further favor β-catenin stabilization basally and restrict GSK3β-mediated phosphorylation and proteasomal degradation to the apical domain. While placode transcription factors LHX2 and LEF1 were nuclear and basal (Figure 2F, left) (Rhee et al., 2006Rhee H. Polak L. Fuchs E. Lhx2 maintains stem cell character in hair follicles.Science. 2006; 312: 1946-1949Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar), suprabasal daughter nuclei were often positive for the SC pioneer factor SOX9 (Figures 2F, right, and S1, planar view). These findings suggested that LHX2/LEF1/AxinLacZ+ basal placode cells may divide asymmetrically to generate suprabasal daughters that become SOX9+. To test that possibility, we used in utero transduction to selectively infect the single layer of surface ectoderm of E9.5 embryos with lentivirus (LV), which by 24–48 hr, stably integrates into the host genome and is thereafter propagated to progeny (Beronja et al., 2010Beronja S. Livshits G. Williams S. Fuchs E. Rapid functional dissection of genetic networks via tissue-specific transduction and RNAi in mouse embryos.Nat. Med. 2010; 16: 821-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). We infected Rosa26-fl-STOP-fl-YFP (R26YFPfl/+) embryos with LV expressing an inducible CreER recombinase (LV-Cre) (Figure 2G). Low-dose tamoxifen at E15.5 activated CreER in isolated cells throughout the skin. Shortly thereafter, several small YFP+ clones with Pcadhi basal and SOX9+ suprabasal cells were detected within hair placodes (Figure 2H). These data were consistent with the notion that outcomes of these early asymmetric cell divisions were asymmetric fates. We revisit this idea in more detail later. Based upon loss-of-function studies with β-catenin and gain-of-function studies with the direct WNT inhibitor DKK1 (Andl et al., 2002Andl T. Reddy S.T. Gaddapara T. Millar S.E. WNT signals are required for the initiation of hair follicle development.Dev.

If the purpose of the subsequent perpendicular divisions within placodes is to release suprabasal daughters from the high-WNT-signaling environment of their parents, then super-activation of WNT-signaling should prevent SOX9+ cell specification. We tested this possibility by mosaically ablating the gene encoding APC, a member of the AXIN-APC-GSK3β complex that sequesters and targets non-junctional β-catenin for phosphorylation and proteasome-mediated degradation (Azzolin et al., 2014Azzolin L.

The Adenomatous polyposis coli tumour suppressor is essential for Axin complex assembly and function and opposes Axin’s interaction with Dishevelled.Open Biol. 2011; 1: 110013Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Given the severity of conditionally ablating Apc in skin (Kuraguchi et al., 2006Kuraguchi M. Wang X.P. Bronson R.T. Rothenberg R. Ohene-Baah N.Y. Lund J.J. Kucherlapati M. Maas R.L. Kucherlapati R. Adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) is required for normal development of skin and thymus.PLoS Genet. 2006; 2: e146Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar), we infected E9.5 Apcfl/fl; R26YFPfl/+ embryos with low-titer LV-Cre. Small mosaic patches of Apc-null-derived YFP+ epidermal cells exhibited robust WNT-signaling as evidenced by elevated nuclear β-catenin and LEF1 (Figures 3A and 3B ). Notably, the Apc-null patches were LHX2+ and devoid of SOX9, indicating a skewing of fates relative to their wild-type counterparts. Within the basal plane, a halo of wild-type (WT) SOX9+ cells surrounded the Apc-null patches (Figure 3B). Since the SOX9+ halo was ApcWT while LHX2+ cells were Apc null, halo cells could not have been generated by asymmetric cell divisions. Rather, the unifying feature between this mosaic, genetically altered skin and native, asymmetrically dividing skin placodes was differential levels of WNT-signaling in LHX2+ versus SOX9+ neighbors. To pursue the hypothesis that specification of SOX9+ cells is dependent on juxtaposing WNTlo cells with WNThi ones, we tested the reverse, namely the consequences to asymmetric cell fates when mosaic clones null for the β-catenin gene (Ctnnb1) were juxtaposed with WT clones. In WT patches, nuclear LEF1 was seen throughout IFE, even though it was higher in hair placodes. By contrast, Ctnnb1-null epidermal patches lacked not only β-catenin, but also nuclear LEF1 (Figure 3C). Basal placode markers LHX2 and high Pcad were also not found in Ctnnb1-null patches, further underscoring the requirement of WNT-signaling for placode formation (Figure 3D). Notably, however, a halo of SOX9-expressing Ctnnb1-null epidermal cells surrounded WT placodes. As demonstrated by LV-Cre-mediated YFP+ lineage tracing, these SOX9+ cells remained in the epidermis and did not migrate into or contribute to HFs (Figure 3E). Together, these gain- and loss-of-function studies provided compelling evidence that the key feature enabling SOX9+ cell specification is juxtaposition of WNThi and WNTlo signaling cells. In developing HFs, this juxtaposition appeared to be achieved through asymmetric cell divisions, displacing the suprabasal daughter from the WNThi environment of its parent and linking asymmetric fates to asymmetric divisions. Our findings show that if this condition is met by other means (e.g., through mosaic genetic mutation), asymmetric divisions are not needed to generate asymmetric fates. In many cell types, WNT-signaling is thought to promote self-renewal and proliferation (Clevers et al., 2014Clevers H. Loh K.M. Nusse R. Stem cell signaling.

As expected, short-term labeling with nucleotide analog 5′-ethynyl-2′-deoxyuridine (EdU) showed little or no overlap with mKO2+ cells. In the epidermis, mKO2 marked nuclei in terminally differentiating suprabasal layers (Figure 4A, asterisks). Within hair germs, however, mKO2 marked WNThi LHX2+ basal cells. Quantitative flow cytometry analysis confirmed that, in total, ∼20% of hair germ cells were mKO2hi (Figures 4B and S3A). This result was in stark contrast to IFE, where only 2% of α6hi cells were mKO2hi.Figure S3Flow Cytometry Gating Strategy to Isolate Cells from Developing Hair Germs and IFE, Related to Figure 4Show full caption(A) Flow cytometry analysis scheme of developing HFs and IFE from Lhx2-EGFP embryos.

That said, the WNThi cells appeared to be in an extended G1 rather than a G0 state, since asymmetric divisions within this basal pocket were still seen at the hair germ and peg stages and since occasional EdU+ cells were captured within this pocket (Figure 4E). From these data, we concluded that the early WNThi basal cells within the HF not only divide asymmetrically, but do so infrequently. These coupled behaviors ensure that the pocket of WNThi cells, established during placode formation, maintains a constant position and small size throughout HF morphogenesis. Such features also provide little opportunity for these basal cells to alter WNT signaling through cell divisions and/or changes in microenvironment. In contrast to WNThi basal cells, SOX9+ WNTlo suprabasal cells showed signs of rapid proliferation and expansion. The first hint of this proliferation came from our live imaging, where we observed divisions within the suprabasal plane of the p"
https://openalex.org/W2238705702,"Exosomes are small extracellular vesicles released by cells and play important roles in intercellular communication and pathogen transfer. Exosomes have been implicated in several neurodegenerative diseases, including prion disease and Alzheimer disease. Prion disease arises upon misfolding of the normal cellular prion protein, PrPC, into the disease-associated isoform, PrPSc. The disease has a unique transmissible etiology, and exosomes represent a novel and efficient method for prion transmission. The precise mechanism by which prions are transmitted from cell to cell remains to be fully elucidated, although three hypotheses have been proposed: direct cell-cell contact, tunneling nanotubes, and exosomes. Given the reported presence of exosomes in biological fluids and in the lipid and nucleic acid contents of exosomes, these vesicles represent an ideal mechanism for encapsulating prions and potential cofactors to facilitate prion transmission. This study investigates the relationship between exosome release and intercellular prion dissemination. Stimulation of exosome release through treatment with an ionophore, monensin, revealed a corresponding increase in intercellular transfer of prion infectivity. Conversely, inhibition of exosome release using GW4869 to target the neutral sphingomyelinase pathway induced a decrease in intercellular prion transmission. Further examination of the effect of monensin on PrP conversion revealed that monensin also alters the conformational stability of PrPC, leading to increased generation of proteinase K-resistant prion protein. The findings presented here provide support for a positive relationship between exosome release and intercellular transfer of prion infectivity, highlighting an integral role for exosomes in facilitating the unique transmissible nature of prions."

Here, to gain insight into the mechanism of intracellular TDP-43 accumulation, we examined the relationship between phosphorylation and aggregation of TDP-43. We found that expression of a hyperactive form of casein kinase 1 δ (CK1δ1-317, a C-terminally truncated form) promotes mislocalization and cytoplasmic accumulation of phosphorylated TDP-43 (ubiquitin- and p62-positive) in cultured neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells. Insoluble phosphorylated TDP-43 prepared from cells co-expressing TDP-43 and CK1δ1-317 functioned as seeds for TDP-43 aggregation in cultured cells, indicating that CK1δ1-317-induced aggregated TDP-43 has prion-like properties. A striking toxicity and alterations of TDP-43 were also observed in yeast expressing TDP-43 and CK1δ1-317. Therefore, abnormal activation of CK1δ causes phosphorylation of TDP-43, leading to the formation of cytoplasmic TDP-43 aggregates, which, in turn, may trigger neurodegeneration.

Intracellular aberrant protein aggregates in affected neurons are one of the neuropathological features of neurodegenerative diseases, and the formation of intracellular aggregates is believed to be associated with neurodegeneration leading to the onset of disease. Cytoplasmic proteins such as tau in Alzheimer disease and α-synuclein in Parkinson disease are accumulated in insoluble inclusions consisting of abnormal filaments with the fine structure of amyloid (12Goedert M.

In most cases, these proteins are hyperphosphorylated abnormally and aggregated in neuronal cells. Therefore, abnormal hyperphosphorylation is one of the characteristic posttranslational modifications of aggregated proteins in most neurodegenerative diseases, and phosphorylation is thought to be a key event in the formation of toxic intracellular protein aggregates.

In this study, we examined which kinase is mainly involved in the formation of intracellular phosphorylated TDP-43 aggregates in cultured cells and yeast. We found that the hyperactive form of casein kinase 1 δ (CK1δ1-317, a C-terminally truncated form of CK1δ) promotes not only phosphorylation but also cytoplasmic localization and aggregation of TDP-43 most effectively among the tested kinases. CK1δ1-317-induced intracellular phosphorylated TDP-43 aggregates were found to serve as seeds for TDP-43 aggregation in cells. Significant toxicity and alterations of TDP-43 were also observed in yeast expressing TDP-43 and CK1δ1-317. Our results clearly show that phosphorylation of TDP-43 by abnormally activated CK1δ causes both cytoplasmic aggregation of TDP-43 and cytotoxicity in vitro and in vivo, establishing a novel mechanism of neurodegeneration that is likely to be relevant to the pathogenesis of diseases such as FTLD and ALS.

Human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells obtained from the ATCC (Manassas, VA) were cultured in DMEM/F12 medium (Sigma) supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum, penicillin-streptomycin-glutamine (Life Technologies), and MEM non-essential amino acid solution (Life Technologies). The cells were maintained at 37 °C under a humidified atmosphere of 5% (v/v) CO2 in air. They were grown to 50% confluence in 6-well culture dishes for transient expression and then transfected with each expression vector (usually 1 μg) using XtreamGENE9 (Roche) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. Under our conditions, the efficiency of transfection using the pEGFP-C1 vector was 20∼30%. The expression vectors for the SH-SY5Y cells used in this study were as follows: pcDNA3.1-TDP-43 WT, pcDNA3.1-TDP-43 lacking a nuclear localization signal (78–84 residues, ΔNLS), pCS2-Myc-CK1α1, pCS2-Myc-CK1α2, pCS2-Myc-CK1δ, pCS2-Myc-CK1ϵ, pcDNA3.1-FLAG-CK1δ1-317, pcDNA3.1-HA-CK2, pME18S-Cdc7-HA, and pME18S-ASK-FLAG. The pCS2-Myc vectors were provided by Drs. Cheong Jit Kong and David M. Virshup (Duke-NUS Graduate Medical School Singapore). SH-SY5Y cells grown in a 6-well plate were transfected with several expression vectors. After incubation for 1∼3 days, the cells were harvested and lysed in 300 μl of homogenization buffer (HB buffer: 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) containing 0.8 m NaCl, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm DTT, and 1% N-lauroylsarcosine sodium salt (Sarkosyl)) by brief sonication. The lysates were centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 20 min at room temperature. The supernatant was recovered as Sarkosyl (Sar)-soluble fraction (Sar-sup). The pellet was suspended in 100 μl SDS-sample buffer and sonicated. The resulting samples were used as the Sar-insoluble fraction (Sar-ppt). Each sample was separated by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with the indicated antibodies as described previously (26Nonaka T. Watanabe S.T. Iwatsubo T. Hasegawa M.

The PCR reactions were carried out as follows: 1 min at 95 °C for the initial denaturation followed by 40 cycles of amplification at 95 °C for 15 s and 60 °C for 60 s. Site-directed mutagenesis of the CK1δ1-317 gene was performed to switch Lys-38 to alanine and arginine by using a site-directed mutagenesis kit (Agilent Technologies). All constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. Sarkosyl-insoluble fraction prepared from cells expressing TDP-43 and CK1δ1-317 was subjected to 12% SDS-PAGE. After electrophoresis, the pS409/410-positive, ∼46-kDa bands were dissected and digested in-gel with trypsin. The digests were applied to a DiNa HPLC system fitted with an automatic sampler (KYA Technology Corp., Tokyo, Japan). A packed nanocapillary column (catalog no. NTCC-360/75-3-123; 0.075-mm inner diameter × 125 mm length; particle diameter, 3 μm; Nikkyo Technos Co. Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) was used at a flow rate of 200 nl/min with a 2–80% linear gradient of acetonitrile in 0.1% formic acid. Eluted peptides were detected directly with an ion trap mass spectrometer (Velos Pro, Thermo Fisher Scientific). The obtained spectra were analyzed with Proteome Discoverer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and Mascot software (Matrix Science). Cells co-expressing TDP-43 and CK1δ1-317 were incubated for 3 days and then harvested. The Sar-ppt was prepared as described above and used as seeds. The Sar-ppt was resuspended in 100 μl of PBS and sonicated briefly. The resulting suspension (10 μl) was mixed with 120 μl of Opti-MEM (Life Technologies) and 62.5 μl of Multifectam reagent (Promega). After incubation for 30 min at room temperature, 62.5 μl of Opti-MEM was added, and the incubation continued for 5 min at room temperature. Then the mixtures were added to cells expressing TDP-43, and incubation continued for 6 h in a CO2 incubator. After incubation, the medium was replaced with fresh DMEM/F12, and culture continued for the indicated period in each case. The cells were prepared for immunofluorescence and/or immunoblotting analyses as described above. Under our conditions, the efficiency of introduction of Sar-ppt seeds was ∼10%. Standard yeast medium and transformation technology were used. Yeast cells were grown at 30 °C. The human TDP-43 gene with or without GFP was inserted into a pYES2/CT expression vector (Life Technologies). The human full-length CK1δ and CK1δ1-317 genes were inserted into a pRS315 vector under the GAL1 promoter. The wild-type yeast strain BY4741 was transformed with these plasmids and plated on SD (synthetic complete containing dextrose)-Ura-Leu plates to isolate double-transfected yeast cells. For the cell toxicity assay, these cells were cultured in SD-Ura-Leu medium, washed, plated on SD-Ura-Leu (expression off) or SG (synthetic complete containing galactose)-Ura-Leu (expression on) plates and incubated for 2 days. For Western blotting, these cells were cultured in SD-Ura-Leu medium, washed, and then cultured in SG-Ura-Leu medium for 2 days. Cells were collected and broken with glass beads in HB buffer using a bead shocker. The lysates were centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 20 min at room temperature. The supernatant was recovered as the Sar-sup. The pellet was suspended in 100 μl of SDS-sample buffer and sonicated. The resulting samples were used as the Sar-ppt. For microscopic analysis, cells were cultured in SD-Ura-Leu medium, washed, and then cultured in SG-Ura-Leu medium for 10 h. Cells were fixed and mounted on slide glasses with Hoechst 33342 (Life Technologies) and observed with a fluorescence microscope (BZ-X710, Keyence). Statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism 6 software (GraphPad Software). Data were analyzed statistically using unpaired two-tailed Student's t test. A p value of 0.05 or less was considered to be statistically significant.

To address these questions, we co-expressed each kinase and TDP-43 in cultured neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells. The cells were transiently transfected with each expression vector for 2∼3 days and then harvested. The cells were lysed, and the lysates were fractionated and subjected to immunoblot analysis. As shown in Fig. 1, intracellular expression of each kinase and TDP-43 was confirmed. In cells transfected with both the hyperactive form of CK1δ (CK1δ1-317), which lacks the C-terminal domain (27Graves P.R. Roach P.J.

On the other hand, in cells transfected with TDP-43 and any one of CK1α, CK1ϵ, CK2, and Cdc7/ASK (Dbf4/activator of S phase kinase, known as the activator of Cdc7 (29Kitamura R. Fukatsu R. Kakusho N.

To monitor the localization and aggregation of TDP-43, we performed immunofluorescence analyses of these transfected cells. In confocal microscopic analyses of cells transfected with FLAG-tagged CK1δ1-317 alone, endogenous TDP-43 was phosphorylated and aggregated in the cytoplasm (Fig. 2). In cells expressing both FLAG-tagged CK1δ1-317 and TDP-43, cytoplasmic inclusions composed of phosphorylated TDP-43 were observed, and these inclusions were also stained with anti-ubiquitin and anti-p62 antibodies. Therefore, their characteristics are very similar to those of the phosphorylated TDP-43 inclusions positive for ubiquitin and p62 seen in the brains of patients with TDP-43 proteinopathy. Next we performed time course experiments with cells expressing TDP-43 and FLAG-tagged CK1δ1-317. Cells were transfected with plasmids expressing TDP-43, FLAG-tagged CK1δ1-317, or both, followed by immunoblotting analysis. In cells expressing TDP-43 alone, phosphorylated TDP-43 was not observed in the Sar-sup or Sar-ppt (Fig. 3). In cells transfected with FLAG-tagged CK1δ1-317 alone, endogenous TDP-43 was phosphorylated and aggregated on days 2 and 3. The level of FLAG-tagged CK1δ1-317 in the Sar-ppt was slightly greater than that in the Sar-sup, indicating that FLAG-tagged CK1δ1-317 is aggregation-prone (Fig. 3). We also observed that phosphorylation and aggregation of full-length TDP-43 preceded the fragmentation of phosphorylated TDP-43 in cells expressing both TDP-43 and FLAG-tagged CK1δ1-317 (Fig. 3). Taken together, these results clearly indicate that expression of CK1δ1-317 induces phosphorylation and mislocalization of TDP-43 and the formation of intracellular TDP-43 aggregates similar to those found in the brains of FTLD-TDP or ALS patients. To investigate whether the phosphorylation and induced aggregation of TDP-43 by CK1δ1-317 are accompanied by changes in the biological properties of TDP-43, we first performed an exon skipping assay of CFTR, which is a well known target of TDP-43 (31Buratti E. Dörk T. Zuccato E. Pagani F. Romano M. Baralle F.E. Nuclear factor TDP-43 and SR proteins promote in vitro and in vivo CFTR exon 9 skipping.EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1774-1784Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4A, CFTR exon 9 skipping activity was decreased significantly in cells expressing both TDP-43 and CK1δ1-317 compared with cells expressing TDP-43 alone. Furthermore, we evaluated the mRNA levels of endogenous HDAC6, which has also been reported to be a target of TDP-43 (32Fiesel F.C. Voigt A. Weber S.S. Van den Haute C. Waldenmaier A. Görner K.

Real-time PCR analyses confirmed that endogenous HDAC6 mRNA levels were reduced in cells transfected with both TDP-43 and CK1δ1-317 compared with cells transfected with TDP-43 alone (Fig. 4B). These results suggest that the levels of soluble and functional TDP-43 are reduced in cells expressing TDP-43 and CK1δ1-317 and, consequently, that physiological activities of TDP-43 are suppressed in these cells compared with normal cells.

These results shed light on a new and critical task of Ste24, which safeguards the essential process of translocation. Up to 30% of proteins in any eukaryotic proteome reside within the endomembrane system (Chen et al., 2005Chen Y. Zhang Y. Yin Y. Gao G. Li S. Jiang Y. Gu X. Luo J. SPD—a web-based secreted protein database.Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: D169-D173Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). The first step in the biogenesis of these numerous proteins involves their translocation, either partially or fully, into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) through the translocon channel (Park and Rapoport, 2012Park E. Rapoport T.A. Mechanisms of Sec61/SecY-mediated protein translocation across membranes.Annu. Rev. Biophys. 2012; 41: 21-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Endomembrane proteins, which are translated on cytosolic ribosomes, can be targeted and inserted into the ER through several pathways (Ast and Schuldiner, 2013Ast T. Schuldiner M. All roads lead to Rome (but some may be harder to travel): SRP-independent translocation into the endoplasmic reticulum.Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2013; 48: 273-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, Aviram and Schuldiner, 2014Aviram N. Schuldiner M. Embracing the void—how much do we really know about targeting and translocation to the endoplasmic reticulum?.Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2014; 29: 8-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Based on its biophysical attributes, an endomembrane protein might translocate into the ER with the help of the signal recognition particle (SRP) targeting pathway, which tightly couples translation and translocation (Grudnik et al., 2009Grudnik P. Bange G. Sinning I. Protein targeting by the signal recognition particle.Biol. Chem. 2009; 390: 775-782Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Other substrates target and translocate into the ER through pathways that are not as tightly coupled to their translation, using SRP independent mechanisms. These SRP-independent pathways use alternate means to thread their substrates into the ER, such as the Sec62/Sec63 machinery, which utilizes the luminal Hsp70 Kar2/BiP to ratchet proteins into the ER lumen (Park and Rapoport, 2012Park E. Rapoport T.A. Mechanisms of Sec61/SecY-mediated protein translocation across membranes.Annu. Rev. Biophys. 2012; 41: 21-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Although the process of effective translocation has been well outlined, less is known regarding the safeguards in place to deal with faulty translocation in eukaryotes. Specifically, SRP-independent translocation, which caters to a sizable fraction of endomembrane proteins (Ast et al., 2013Ast T. Cohen G. Schuldiner M. A network of cytosolic factors targets SRP-independent proteins to the endoplasmic reticulum.Cell. 2013; 152: 1134-1145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, Jan et al., 2014Jan C.H. Williams C.C. Weissman J.S. Principles of ER cotranslational translocation revealed by proximity-specific ribosome profiling.Science. 2014; 346: 1257521Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar), is more prone to difficulties than its SRP-dependent counterpart. For example, these substrates can undergo premature cytosolic folding, precluding them from being linearly threaded through the translocon pore (Ast et al., 2014Ast T. Aviram N. Chuartzman S.G. Schuldiner M. A cytosolic degradation pathway, prERAD, monitors pre-inserted secretory pathway proteins.J.

Although SRP independent substrates are bound by cytosolic chaperones prior to translocation (Ngosuwan et al., 2003Ngosuwan J. Wang N.M. Fung K.L. Chirico W.J. Roles of cytosolic Hsp70 and Hsp40 molecular chaperones in post-translational translocation of presecretory proteins into the endoplasmic reticulum.J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 7034-7042Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), most likely to minimize instances of cytosolic folding, these chaperones disengage from the substrate once translocation has started (Plath and Rapoport, 2000Plath K. Rapoport T.A. Spontaneous release of cytosolic proteins from posttranslational substrates before their transport into the endoplasmic reticulum.J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 167-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Thus, an error-prone window of time exists in which a translocating SRP independent substrate, bound by Kar2/BiP in the ER lumen, may fold domains that are still in the cytosol. This protein can neither continue to translocate into the ER nor retrotranslocate into the cytosol and will become “clogged” in the translocon. Such a clogged protein would obstruct the translocon channel and preclude it from translocating other substrates, requiring external quality control measures to identify and resolve this debilitating stalemate. Such clogging events have been shown to occur in bacteria and require the actions of the protease FtsH to cleave the clogged translocon, inducing its turnover (van Stelten et al., 2009van Stelten J. Silva F. Belin D. Silhavy T.J. Effects of antibiotics and a proto-oncogene homolog on destruction of protein translocator SecY.Science. 2009; 325: 753-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). However, a homologous or analogous pathway has yet to be described in eukaryotes. To uncover potential quality control machineries that take part in relieving clogging events, we created an inducible clogging-prone construct (i.e., clogger). We crossed this construct into the yeast deletion and hypomorphic allele collection, querying the yeast genome for machineries that resolve the burden of clogging. This screen indicated that the ER metalloprotease Ste24 might have a role in this process. We could show that the clogged form of the construct indeed accumulated and translocation was slowed down in Δste24 cells expressing the clogger or in clogging-enhancing genetic backgrounds. Upon clogging, Ste24 approaches the SRP independent translocon, engages the clogged form of the construct, and mediates its degradation. Notably, we could show that this declogging function of Ste24 is conserved for human ZMPSTE24. Together, these findings reveal a novel quality control mechanism overseeing translocation, at the heart of which lies the crucial and conserved metalloprotease Ste24/ZMPSTE24. The protein-conducting channel of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), the translocon, creates a hydrophilic channel ∼15Å in diameter (Hamman et al., 1997Hamman B.D. Chen J.C. Johnson E.E. Johnson A.E. The aqueous pore through the translocon has a diameter of 40–60 A during cotranslational protein translocation at the ER membrane.Cell. 1997; 89: 535-544Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar, van den Berg et al., 2004van den Berg B.

We hypothesized that this physical boundary might pose a problem for translocating substrates with domains that have been afforded a chance to fold in the cytosol. Preinsertional cytosolic folding of endomembrane proteins may become more abundant when translation and translocation are not coupled, as in the case of SRP-independent proteins (Ast et al., 2013Ast T. Cohen G. Schuldiner M. A network of cytosolic factors targets SRP-independent proteins to the endoplasmic reticulum.Cell. 2013; 152: 1134-1145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, Jan et al., 2014Jan C.H. Williams C.C. Weissman J.S. Principles of ER cotranslational translocation revealed by proximity-specific ribosome profiling.Science. 2014; 346: 1257521Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). Once an SRP-independent substrate is engaged by the translocation machinery but cannot transverse the translocon pore, translocon blocking (i.e., clogging) would occur. How the cell solves this debilitating problem that would disrupt ER homeostasis is unknown (Figure 1A). We set out to study how eukaryotic cells manage translocon clogging in the well-established endomembrane system of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We built an inducible clogging-prone construct (Figure 1B, left), based on the SRP-independent glycoprotein Pdi1 (Ng et al., 1996Ng D.T. Brown J.D. Walter P. Signal sequences specify the targeting route to the endoplasmic reticulum membrane.J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 269-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar) under the control of a galactose-induced promoter. To tip the scales in favor of this construct folding at its C terminus (C′) and inducing clogging, we fused the yeast PDI1 to the Escherichia coli dehydrofolate reductase (DHFR) enzyme, which generates a rapid and stable fold (Lee et al., 2001Lee C. Schwartz M.P. Prakash S. Iwakura M. Matouschek A. ATP-dependent proteases degrade their substrates by processively unraveling them from the degradation signal.Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 627-637Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). Importantly, E. coli DHFR folds stably even in the absence of methotrexate, precluding the need to add this toxic drug to induce clogging (Bhamidipati et al., 2005Bhamidipati A. Denic V. Quan E.M. Weissman J.S. Exploration of the topological requirements of ERAD identifies Yos9p as a lectin sensor of misfolded glycoproteins in the ER lumen.Mol. Cell. 2005; 19: 741-751Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Finally, three N-linked glycosylation (3Gly) sites and a hemagglutinin (HA) tag were placed at the C′ of the construct. Because N-linked glycosylation takes place in the ER lumen and it generates a size shift that can be assayed by western blot, this “clogger” construct would serve not only to induce translocon clogging, but also as a reporter for three translocational states by anti-HA western blot (Figure 1B, right): (1) When fully inserted into the ER, all sites would be glycosylated to generate a slowly migrating form. (2) When clogged (i.e., Pdi1 has translocated and undergone glycosylation but the rapid folding of the DHFR in the cytosol prevented the rest of the protein from inserting), a hemiglycosylated form would be apparent. This would result in an intermediate size band. (3) When uninserted, all of the construct would be unglycosylated, producing a fast-migrating form. To verify that the clogger accurately reports on its translocational status the construct was inserted into either wild type (WT) or mutant cells depleted for the various subunits of the SRP independent translocon (Figure 1C). Indeed, three migrational forms were present in all strains, indicating that all three states of insertion are detectable. As expected, the predominant fraction in WT cells was the inserted form, whereas the unglycosylated form was prevalent in cells with reduced translocation. Moreover, when glycosylation was chemically attenuated with the N-linked glycosylation inhibitor tunicamycin, only the fastest migrating form of the clogger was present. To further verify that the intermediate “clogged” fraction of the construct is engaging the translocon, we performed a crosslinking experiment, exposing cells expressing the clogger to dithiobis succinimidyl propionate (DSP) and precipitating the Sec61 translocon (Figure S1A). Indeed, following crosslinking with DSP, the Sec61 precipitate is enriched for the clogged form of the construct. Importantly, there is no enrichment for binding with the abundant SRP-independent protein Gas1, excluding the possibility that all proteins undergoing translocation are captured by this crosslinking. This intermediate clogged band is not the result of retrotranslocation, because cells lacking the cytosolic peptide-N-glycanase Png1 (Suzuki et al., 2000Suzuki T. Park H. Hollingsworth N.M. Sternglanz R. Lennarz W.J. PNG1, a yeast gene encoding a highly conserved peptide:N-glycanase.J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 1039-1052Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar) also contain this form of the clogger (Figure S1B). Finally, as predicted, the clogger disrupts ER homeostasis (Figure S1C)—significant activation of the unfolded protein response (UPR) was measured following expression of the clogger (p value < 0.01). To verify that the clogged form that we see is a result of cytosolic folding, we set out to create a clogger in which translation was better coupled to translocation. To this end, we altered the clogger’s signal sequence to that of the established SRP-dependent substrate DPAP-B (Ng et al., 1996Ng D.T. Brown J.D. Walter P. Signal sequences specify the targeting route to the endoplasmic reticulum membrane.J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 269-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). The SRP-independent or -dependent forms of the clogger were induced for an extensive period to ensure that maximal clogging would take place. An anti-HA western blot revealed that at steady state, 26% of the SRP independent construct was clogged, whereas for only 5% of the SRP-dependent counterpart did clogging occur (Figure 1D). Therefore, it appears that clogging reflects the inherent complexity of targeting through the SRP independent pathway, which is intrinsically more prone to substrate folding in the cytosol. Because translocation is an essential process, we assumed that the absence of quality control machinery involved in relieving clogging (exacerbated by the expression of the clogger) would generate a significant growth delay. To find such strains, we inserted the clogger construct into a systematic library of mutants in all yeast genes (Breslow et al., 2008Breslow D.K. Cameron D.M. Collins S.R. Schuldiner M. Stewart-Ornstein J. Newman H.W. Braun S. Madhani H.D. Krogan N.J. Weissman J.S. A comprehensive strategy enabling high-resolution functional analysis of the yeast genome.Nat.

André B. et al.Functional profiling of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae genome.Nature. 2002; 418: 387-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (3238) Google Scholar) using automated mating approaches (Cohen and Schuldiner, 2011Cohen Y. Schuldiner M. Advanced methods for high-throughput microscopy screening of genetically modified yeast libraries.Methods Mol. Biol. 2011; 781: 127-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). As a control, we expressed a cytosolic mCherry in the same collections. We then measured the growth rate (i.e., colony size) of each of these ∼6,000 haploid strains that contained a single genomic mutation as well as either the clogger or mCherry constructs (Figure 2A). More than 100 strains displayed a significantly altered growth pattern when expressing the clogger (FDR corrected p value < 0.05, Figure 2B; Table S1). One strain that grew better than expected upon clogger expression was deleted for the cochaperone for Kar2, Scj1 (Schlenstedt et al., 1995Schlenstedt G. Harris S. Risse B. Lill R. Silver P.A. A yeast DnaJ homologue, Scj1p, can function in the endoplasmic reticulum with BiP/Kar2p via a conserved domain that specifies interactions with Hsp70s.J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 979-988Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). This suggests that when Kar2 is less active, potentially ratcheting SRP-independent substrates into the ER at a slower rate, that less clogging is occurring or that such cases can be more easily resolved. However, we focused on mutations that led to slower growth with the clogger (Figure 2B). First, strains mutated in known SRP-independent translocon subunits displayed attenuated growth, serving as a validating internal control for the screen. Moreover, this slow growth was not a result of the simple overexpression of the SRP-independent substrate Pdi1 (Figure S2A). Second, strains deleted for Ire1 and Hac1 (Walter and Ron, 2011Walter P. Ron D. The unfolded protein response: from stress pathway to homeostatic regulation.Science. 2011; 334: 1081-1086Crossref PubMed Scopus (3881) Google Scholar), the two main signaling components of the UPR, also grew poorly upon clogger expression, in line with our observation that the clogger induces ER stress (Figure S1C). An unexpected yet intriguing observation was that cells lacking the ER localized metalloprotease Ste24 displayed significantly smaller colony size when expressing the clogger, but not when expressing Pdi1 alone (Figure S2B). Ste24 is a highly conserved zinc metalloprotease embedded in the ER membrane whose active site is cytosolic (Fujimura-Kamada et al., 1997Fujimura-Kamada K. Nouvet F.J. Michaelis S. A novel membrane-associated metalloprotease, Ste24p, is required for the first step of NH2-terminal processing of the yeast a-factor precursor.J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 271-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, Schmidt et al., 1998Schmidt W.K. Tam A. Fujimura-Kamada K. Michaelis S. Endoplasmic reticulum membrane localization of Rce1p and Ste24p, yeast proteases involved in carboxyl-terminal CAAX protein processing and amino-terminal a-factor cleavage.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1998; 95: 11175-11180Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that Ste24 could be an interesting candidate for the quality control machinery that resolves translocon clogging. To date, Ste24 has been characterized to take part in the pathway that processes proteins bearing a C′ CAAX motif (C, cysteine; A, aliphatic residue; X, any residue), such as the yeast mating pheromone, a-factor, and mammalian Lamin A (Michaelis and Barrowman, 2012Michaelis S. Barrowman J. Biogenesis of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae pheromone a-factor, from yeast mating to human disease.Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2012; 76: 626-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). However, hints at an additional role for Ste24 have accumulated in the literature. For example, the deletion of Ste24, even in cells that do not express a-factor, generates notable ER stress (Jonikas et al., 2009Jonikas M.C. Collins S.R. Denic V. Oh E. Quan E.M. Schmid V. Weibezahn J. Schwappach B. Walter P. Weissman J.S. Schuldiner M. Comprehensive characterization of genes required for protein folding in the endoplasmic reticulum.Science. 2009; 323: 1693-1697Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar), and it interferes with membrane protein topology (Tipper and Harley, 2002Tipper D.J. Harley C.A. Yeast genes controlling responses to topogenic signals in a model transmembrane protein.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 1158-1174Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), both phenotypes not shared by other a-factor processing enzymes. To ascertain that loss of Ste24 was indeed detrimental to cells expressing the clogger, we first repeated the growth assay with a more precise liquid-growth measurement (Figure 2C). Indeed, although the WT grew more slowly with the clogger than without it, this growth delay was far more pronounced in a strain deleted for Ste24. Next, we directly assayed clogging (Figure 2D). Indeed, Δste24 cells contain highly elevated amounts of the clogged fraction as well as a significant amount of the cytosolic form of the clogger, further attesting to a blockage in translocation. Furthermore, inducing the clogger in the absence of Ste24 attenuated the ER entry of the endogenous SRP independent substrates Gas1 and Pdi1, as well as Kar2, which can utilize both SRP-dependent and -independent pathways for ER entry (Figure 2E) (Ast et al., 2013Ast T. Cohen G. Schuldiner M. A network of cytosolic factors targets SRP-independent proteins to the endoplasmic reticulum.Cell. 2013; 152: 1134-1145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, Ng et al., 1996Ng D.T. Brown J.D. Walter P. Signal sequences specify the targeting route to the endoplasmic reticulum membrane.J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 269-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). It should be noted that these steady-state measures likely underrepresent the fraction of proteins that have failed to translocate because untranslocated proteins are rapidly cleared from the cytosol by prERAD (Ast et al., 2014Ast T. Aviram N. Chuartzman S.G. Schuldiner M. A cytosolic degradation pathway, prERAD, monitors pre-inserted secretory pathway proteins.J. Cell Sci. 2014; 127: 3017-3023Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). On the other hand, SRP-dependent translocation was not affected by the absence of Ste24 (Figure S2C), although expression of the clogger itself did attenuate the translocation of an SRP-dependent substrate, possibly due to the activation of the UPR (Figure S1C). To test that the role of Ste24 in clearing clogged translocons is not specific to our clogger construct, we analyzed a different clogging-prone SRP-independent substrate: Gas1 fused to the stably folding red fluorescent protein (RFP-Gas1) (Figure S2D). Although RFP-Gas1 is normally localized to the cell periphery, in Δste24 cells, it was additionally found on the ER, indicating clogging or attenuated ER entry. This effect was not seen for the SRP-dependent substrate, Hxt2-GFP, in the absence of Ste24 (Figure S2E). Next, we set out to test whether endogenous proteins could clog the translocon. To this end, we mutated Sec66, which is required for early engagement and funneling of SRP-independent substrates into the translocon (Harada et al., 2011Harada Y. Li H. Wall J.S. Li H. Lennarz W.J.

Indeed, in the double-mutant-lacking Sec66 and Ste24, SRP-independent translocation is notably perturbed (Figure 2F). In these cells, Gas1, Kar2, and Pdi1 accumulate in the unglycosylated cytosolic forms, similar to what we had observed for cells lacking Ste24 and expressing the clogger (Figure 2E). This accumulation demonstrates that endogenous SRP-independent proteins can undergo clogging under physiological conditions, requiring the quality control actions of Ste24. These findings would explain the strong negative genetic interaction previously described between Ste24 and Sec66 (Costanzo et al., 2010Costanzo M. Baryshnikova A. Bellay J. Kim Y. Spear E.D. Sevier C.S. Ding H. Koh J.L. Toufighi K. Mostafavi S. et al.The genetic landscape of a cell.Science. 2010; 327: 425-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (1623) Google Scholar). We next wondered whether translocon clogging seen in the absence of Ste24 is simply an indirect effect related to its previously described cellular roles, such as loss of CAAX processing, inducing ER stress or altered membrane protein topology. We first assessed clogging in the absence of other CAAX processing factors by testing proteins both upstream and downstream to Ste24 in the pathway, such as Ram1 or Axl1 (Figure 3A) (Michaelis and Barrowman, 2012Michaelis S. Barrowman J. Biogenesis of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae pheromone a-factor, from yeast mating to human disease.Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2012; 76: 626-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The absence of either of these proteins did not affect clogging. Furthermore, the CAAX processing mutants present in our initial screen (Δrce1 and Δaxl1) did not exhibit any growth defects with the clogger, although they were verified to be deleted (Figure S3A).Figure S3The Effects of Ste24 on the Clogger Are Not Related to CAAX Processing, UPR Activation, or Translocon Availability, Related to Figure 3Show full caption(A) The absence of the CAAX processing pathway does not result in attenuated growth in strains expressing the clogger.

These membranes were analyzed for their ability to support the translocation of the radioactive SRP-independent substrate ppαfactor in vitro.

We generated ER stress in WT cells expressing the clogger by exposing them to the reducing agent DTT (Figure 3B).

In addition to possible RNA toxicity, several dipeptide repeats (DPRs) are translated through repeat-associated non-ATG-initiated translation. The DPRs, including poly(GA), poly(GR), poly(GP), poly(PR), and poly(PA), were found in the brains and spinal cords of C9FTD/ALS patients. Among the DPRs, poly(GA) is highly susceptible to form cytoplasmic inclusions, which is a characteristic of C9FTD/ALS. To elucidate DPR aggregation, we used synthetic (GA)15 DPR as a model system to examine the aggregation and structural properties in vitro. We found that (GA)15 with 15 repeats fibrillates rapidly and ultimately forms flat, ribbon-type fibrils evidenced by transmission electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy. The fibrils are capable of amyloid dye binding and contain a characteristic cross-β sheet structure, as revealed by x-ray scattering. Furthermore, using neuroblastoma cells, we demonstrated the neurotoxicity and cell-to-cell transmission property of (GA)15 DPR. Overall, our results show the structural and toxicity properties of GA DPR to facilitate future DPR-related therapeutic development.

The reading frames of repeat-associated non-ATG-initiated translation from sense sequence G4C2 transcripts generate three DPRs (GA, GR, and GP), whereas antisense G2C4 transcripts generate PR and PA DPRs. The discovery of these protein inclusions in C9 FTLD/ALS highlighted the importance of the DPRs. Protein inclusions are common pathological hallmarks in many neurodegenerative diseases, such as amyloid β in Alzheimer disease and α-synuclein in Parkinson disease. Here we aimed to characterize DPRs, focusing on the GA peptide. In our study, we used synthetic GA DPRs with 15 repeats to characterize the peptide properties and address the pathology found in FTLD/ALS patients. We found that (GA)15 rapidly forms amyloid fibrils, starting with the formation of short filaments and, later, ribbon-type fibrils. The aggregates are neurotoxic and exhibit transmission properties among cells. GA peptides were synthesized by solid-phase peptide synthesis in the Genomics Research Center, Academia Sinica, Taiwan. The DPRs were dissolved at 4 mg/ml in hexafluoroisopropanol (Sigma) to eliminate preaggregates and incubated at room temperature for 2 h. Hexafluoroisopropanol was evaporated by vacuum, and peptides were dissolved further in dichloroactic acid (DCA) (Sigma). (GA)15 stock in DCA was then added to 100 mm Na2HPO4 buffer and adjusted to pH 7.4. All samples were prepared freshly prior to the experiments. The final DCA concentration in all experiments was 0.1%. Different concentrations of DPR peptides were incubated at room temperature, and the aggregation was examined by turbidity measurement. Turbidity was indicated by absorbance at 450 nm by an UV-visible spectrophotometer (DU800, Beckman Coulter) with a 1-cm light path quartz cuvette (Hellma). The cuvette was sealed with Parafilm to prevent evaporation. The experiment was performed at least three times under each condition (n ≥ 3). Absorbance readings were taken every 5 min, and each experiment was monitored for 90 min. ThT was added at 10× dilution to 100 μm (GA)15 samples right before the measurement. The final ThT concentration was 10 μm. ThT fluorescence was excited at 442 nm in a FluoroMax3 spectrometer (Horiba Scientific) with a 3-mm light path 165-QS quartz cuvette (Hellma). Spectra were recorded from 460–550 nm. The fluorescence intensity at 480 nm was plotted against the incubation time. (GA)15 peptides were prepared using the same method as for the turbidity assay. All samples were prepared freshly, and the buffer was filtered through a 0.2-μm filter membrane. After preparation, 50 μl of the sample was loaded immediately into a 3-mm light path quartz cuvette (Hellma), and the particle size distribution was measured in Zetasizer NanoZA (Malvern). The system temperature was maintained at 25 °C. Each curve was averaged from 12 or more scans. The samples were deposited on 400-mesh formvar carbon-coated copper grids (Electron Microscopy Sciences) for 20 min, stained negatively with 2% uranyl acetate, and rinsed. The grids were examined using field emission gun TEM (FEI Tecnai G2 TF20 Super Twin) with an accelerating voltage of 120 kV. AFM measurements were carried out on a Bruker AXS Multimode NanoScope V equipped with a commercial fluid cell tip holder. The Peakforce mode was used for imaging. For Peakforce mode, the sample was oscillated in a vertical direction with an amplitude of 35∼100 nm and at a frequency of 2 kHz. The vertical piezo movement results in cycles of approaching and retracting traces in which the tip makes intermittent contact with the sample surface. A force-distance curve was acquired in each cycle. Topography information was obtained from the height correction performed by the feedback loop to keep a constant “peak” of force. The gold-coated backside silicon cantilevers (NanosensorsTM FM-AuD) with a spring constant of 2∼4 N/m were used. The nominal tip radius was ∼10 nm. Prior to the AFM measurements, the AFM probe was cleaned with UV light. In AFM imaging, the scan rate was ∼1 Hz, and the peak force was set at 125∼625 pN. The substrate for sample adsorption was a square piece of highly ordered pyrolytic graphite (lateral sizes of 12 × 12 mm, ZYH; Structure Probe, Inc.) that was glued to a round metal chip fixed magnetically to the AFM stage. To observe the morphology of (GA)15 fibrils, we used highly ordered pyrolytic graphite as the scanning surface. (GA)15 DPR aggregated at 100 μm was diluted to 10 μm in 25 μl of buffer and deposited onto a freshly cleaved highly ordered pyrolytic graphite. When we installed the sample into the fluid cell (60 μl), more buffer was added to fill in the cell. The sample was imaged at three to six different positions to ensure that the observations were consistent and representative. All scans were performed at room temperature under a liquid environment in the fluid cell tip holder. FTIR spectroscopy was performed with a Nicolet 6700 FTIR spectrometer (Thermo) equipped with a MIRacle single-reflection attenuated total reflection crystal (Pike Technologies). The samples were prepared as aforementioned preparation but grown in D2O. The samples were then precipitated by centrifugation at 17,000 × g for 30 min. The pellets were washed with D2O and centrifuged again. The pellets were resuspended in D2O and dotted repeatedly on the ZnSe crystal until dried. FTIR spectra were collected in the range of 600–4000 cm−1 with a resolution of 2 cm−1 at room temperature. More than 100 scans were averaged and normalized. Congo red stock solution was prepared as 100 μm in PBS/EtOH buffer containing 137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 10 mm Na2HPO4, 1.8 mm KH2PO4, and 10% ethanol. The (GA)15 end point product (5 μl, 100 μm) was diluted in 80 μl of PBS/EtOH and mixed with 15 μl of Congo red stock. The final concentration of Congo red was 15 μm, and the final concentration of (GA)15 was 5 μm. (GA)15 fibrils were stained for 12 h and pelleted at 17,000 × g for 20 min. Pellets were then resuspended in 10 μl of Milli-Q water and blotted on a glass slide. Birefringence images were captured with a Leica upright microscope (DM6000B) with a polarizer. ThT stock (0.5 μl, 1 mm) was added to the (GA)15 end point product (10 μl, 100 μm). The final concentration of ThT was 50 μm. The solution was dotted on glass slides and observed under an Olympus IX81 fluorescence microscope with a DP80 camera. The (GA)15 end point product was collected from a sample solution centrifuged at 17,000 × g for 20 min. The concentrated product was then washed repeatedly with Milli-Q water, centrifuged, and recollected to eliminate salts. The final purified product was resuspended in water and then dropped on a Kapton thin film substrate for SAXS/WAXS with the 23A SWAXS instrument of the National Synchrotron Radiation Research Center, Taiwan (16Xu C.F.

SAXS data were collected with a two-dimensional Pilatus-1MF detector, and WAXS data were collected with either a two-dimensional complementary metal-oxide semiconductor detector (C9728DK) or a linear pixel detector (Mythen-3k) for improved resolution. The scattering wave vector q = 4πλ−1sinθ, defined by the wavelength λ (1.24 Å) and scattering angle 2θ, was calibrated using the diffraction peaks from mixture powders of silicon and silver behenate. Background scattering from a similar Kapton film was subtracted from the SAXS/WAXS data measured for the sample. Human neuroblastoma BE(2)-C cells (ATCC, catalog no. CRL-2268) were incubated at 37 °C under 5% CO2 and cultured in RPMI medium with 10% FBS. For the ROS test, 40,000 BE(2)-C cells were seeded, and the medium was replaced on the second day with 40 μl of DMEM/F12 (Life Technologies) phenol red-free medium containing 15 μm of CM-H2DCFDA (Life Technologies). After 1 h of incubation with CM-H2DCFDA, 20 μl of the samples was added to the wells. Cells were incubated at 37 °C for another 3 h, and the fluorescence was monitored in a microplate reader (SpectraMax M5, Molecular Devices) with excitation and emission wavelengths of 480 and 535 nm, respectively. Data were normalized to the buffer control (n = 4). For the MTT assay, cells were seeded in RPMI medium in a 96-well plate with 40,000 cells/well 1 day before the experiment. The medium was discarded, and the cells were washed with RPMI medium without FBS. RPMI medium (40 μl) was added to each well, followed by addition of 20 μl of 100 μm (GA)15, and the cells were incubated for an additional 24 h. Afterward, 7 μl of 5 mg/ml MTT solution was added and incubated for 3 h. The medium was discarded, and dimethyl sulfoxide was used to lyse the formazan crystals. Absorbance at 570 and 690 nm was measured by an ELISA microplate reader (SpectraMax M5). The absorbance differences between 570 and 690 nm were calculated, averaged (n = 4), and obtained by subtracting the background without cells. Each data set was normalized using the buffer control. Sterilized glass coverslips were placed on 6-cm plates. A total of 150,000 mouse neuroblastoma Neuro-2a cells (N2a, ATCC, catalog no. CCL-131) were seeded in each plate and incubated with 2 μm (GA)15 samples as indicated for 1 h. The FLAG-(GA)80 plasmid (a gift from Dr. Fen-Biao Gao, University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester, MA) was transfected in the cells using Xtreme HP reagent (Roche) according to the protocol of the manufacturer. For immunocytochemistry, cells on glass slides were obtained at the indicated times, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min, washed with PBS, treated with 0.3% Triton X-100 for another 30 min, and washed again. Blocking buffer containing 5% bovine serum albumin was used, and the cells were stained by anti-FLAG mouse IgG (Sigma, catalog no. F3165, lot no. SLBH1191V), followed by Alexa Fluor 594-labeled secondary antibody (Life Technologies). Finally, the coverslips were mounted with ProlongGold with DAPI staining (Life Technologies). Images were captured with a Leica upright microscope (DM6000B). Cells from the above experiment were lysed in lysis buffer containing 5 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.8), 1 mm EDTA, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.5% IGEPAL CA-630, and cOmpleteTM EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixtures (Roche) on ice at the concentration provided by the manufacturer. The cell lysates were centrifuged at 2000 × g for 2 min at 4 °C to spin down the cell debris. Afterward, the supernatants were collected. Protein concentration was quantified by BCA assay kit (Pierce), and 50 μg of protein was loaded into the well of a Bio-Dot SF microfiltration apparatus (Bio-Rad) containing a cellulose acetate membrane with a pore size of 0.8 μm. Anti-FLAG mouse IgG followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody were used for immunoblotting. The image was then quantified using ImageJ (http://imagej.nih.gov/ij/). N2a cells were transfected separately with FLAG-(GA)80 and enhanced GFP (EGFP) plasmids using Xtreme HP reagent (Roche). After transfection, cells were washed with Dulbecco's PBS (Life Technologies) twice and detached from the culture dish. FLAG-(GA)80-transfected cells were mixed with an equal amount of EGFP-transfected N2a cells. A total number of 100,000 cells were seeded on a 6-cm plate with glass coverslips. Cells were fixed 5, 24, 48, and 72 h after seeding. The immunocytochemistry procedure was the same as the aforementioned method. To study the role of DPRs in the pathology of FTLD/ALS patients, we first synthesized three forward-translated frames with 15 DPRs, referred to as (GA)15, (GR)15, and (GP)15. The solubility of (GA)15 is very low, and it cannot be fully dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide, urea, or guanidine hydrochloride but can be dissolved in hexafluoroisopropanol or DCA. We employed DCA to dissolve (GA)15 and other DPRs. The peptide stock was diluted further into 100 mm sodium phosphate buffer to bring the pH back to neutral. After 90-min incubation, (GA)15 exhibited the highest turbidity, whereas (GR)15 and (GP)15 showed only less than 5% of that of (GA)15 (Fig. 1A). When comparing GA DPR with 5, 10, and 15 repeats, i.e. (GA)5, (GA)10, and (GA)15, we found that only (GA)15 aggregated significantly but not (GA)10 and (GA)5 (Fig. 1B). Therefore, we focused on the characterization of (GA)15 aggregation. First, we monitored the aggregation of (GA)15 in 100, 75, 50, 25, and 10 μm in quiescence by absorbance at 450 nm to determine the sample turbidity (Fig. 1C). The absorbance at 450 nm was plotted against the incubation time. We found that absorbance of (GA)15 at 100, 75, 50, and 25 μm, but not 10 μm, increased exponentially right after the measurement. Although several neuropathology studies have identified DPRs in disease lesions, no literature describes whether the DPR inclusions belong to amyloids and whether they react with classic amyloid dyes such as ThT. Therefore, we measured the aggregation kinetics of (GA)15 at 100 μm by ThT fluorescence (Fig. 1D). The ThT result showed that (GA)15 aggregates react with ThT and that the aggregation exhibits a classic amyloid nucleation-dependent pathway with a lag time of around 3 h. The kinetics reached a steady stage around 30 h. In addition, we examined (GA)15 aggregation at 100, 75, 50, 25, and 10 μm by dynamic light scattering (Fig. 2). The result was consistent with our turbidity data, showing that the particle size of (GA)15 at 10 μm did not increase through incubation time but that those of all other (GA)15 with higher concentrations increased significantly up to several micrometers. The dynamic light scattering peak of (GA)15 at 10 μm was retained around 200 nm. The peak is likely due to an artifact because we found a similar peak in the DCA-containing buffer control obtained from an Eppendorf tube.FIGURE 2Dynamic light scattering of (GA)15 aggregation at different incubation times. Dynamic light scattering was used to monitor the particle size distribution during (GA)15 aggregation. A and B, for 100 μm (A) and 75 μm (GA)15 (B), signals colored red, orange, green, olive, cyan, blue, and magenta represent 0, 2.5, 10, 15, 20, 30, and 40 min of incubation, respectively. C, for 50 μm (GA)15, signals colored red, orange, green, olive, cyan, blue, and magenta represent 0, 2.5, 15, 25, 30, 40, and 60 min of incubation, respectively. D and E, for 25 μm (D) and 10 μm (E) of (GA)15, signals colored red, orange, green, olive, cyan, blue, magenta, and purple represent 0, 2.5, 10, 30, 50, 75, 110, and 140 min of incubation, respectively. The buffer peak is indicated as a black dashed line in E.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We further examined the morphological changes of 100 μm (GA)15 during incubation by TEM (Fig. 3). Within 1 h of incubation, (GA)15 had condensed protofibrils, and, at 3 h, (GA)15 had rod-like fibrils. Interestingly, at 24 h of incubation, the fibrils associated laterally into flat sheets and ribbon-type fibrils. At the end of incubation (≥72 h), most (GA)15 exhibited ribbon-type fibrils. In addition, we employed AFM to observe the height of (GA)15 fibrils. The samples were scanned in solution to observe its native hydrated state. In the AFM images, we found many short fibrils (Fig. 4, A and B) that were consistent with our TEM result. Scanning into smaller areas showed that the fibrils were curvy and flat. T"

By studying the stereotypic remodeling of the Drosophila mushroom body (MB), we found that the heme-binding nuclear receptor E75 is dispensable for initial axon outgrowth of MB γ neurons but is required for their developmental regrowth. Genetic experiments and pharmacological manipulations on ex-vivo-cultured brains indicate that neuronally generated nitric oxide (NO) promotes pruning but inhibits regrowth. We found that high NO levels inhibit the physical interaction between the E75 and UNF nuclear receptors, likely accounting for its repression of regrowth. Additionally, NO synthase (NOS) activity is downregulated at the onset of regrowth, at least partially, by short inhibitory NOS isoforms encoded within the NOS locus, indicating how NO production could be developmentally regulated. Taken together, these results suggest that NO signaling provides a switching mechanism between the degenerative and regenerative states of neuronal remodeling."
https://openalex.org/W2248718163,"The morphological, biological, and molecular characteristics of Cryptosporidium muris strain TS03 are described, and the species name Cryptosporidium proliferans n. sp. is proposed. Cryptosporidium proliferans obtained from a naturally infected East African mole rat (Tachyoryctes splendens) in Kenya was propagated under laboratory conditions in rodents (SCID mice and southern multimammate mice, Mastomys coucha) and used in experiments to examine oocyst morphology and transmission. DNA from the propagated C. proliferans isolate, and C. proliferans DNA isolated from the feces of an African buffalo (Syncerus caffer) in Central African Republic, a donkey (Equus africanus) in Algeria, and a domestic horse (Equus caballus) in the Czech Republic were used for phylogenetic analyses. Oocysts of C. proliferans are morphologically distinguishable from C. parvum and C. muris HZ206, measuring 6.8–8.8 (mean = 7.7 μm) × 4.8–6.2 μm (mean = 5.3) with a length to width ratio of 1.48 (n = 100). Experimental studies using an isolate originated from T. splendens have shown that the course of C. proliferans infection in rodent hosts differs from that of C. muris and C. andersoni. The prepatent period of 18–21 days post infection (DPI) for C. proliferans in southern multimammate mice (Mastomys coucha) was similar to that of C. andersoni and longer than the 6–8 DPI prepatent period for C. muris RN66 and HZ206 in the same host. Histopatologicaly, stomach glands of southern multimammate mice infected with C. proliferans were markedly dilated and filled with necrotic material, mucus, and numerous Cryptosporidium developmental stages. Epithelial cells of infected glands were atrophic, exhibited cuboidal or squamous metaplasia, and significantly proliferated into the lumen of the stomach, forming papillary structures. The epithelial height and stomach weight were six-fold greater than in non-infected controls. Phylogenetic analyses based on small subunit rRNA, Cryptosporidium oocyst wall protein, thrombospondin-related adhesive protein of Cryptosporidium-1, heat shock protein 70, actin, heat shock protein 90 (MS2), MS1, MS3, and M16 gene sequences revealed that C. proliferans is genetically distinct from C. muris and other previously described Cryptosporidium species."
https://openalex.org/W2409161719,"In preparation for the introduction of human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine, we investigated awareness and knowledge of HPV/HPV vaccine and potential acceptability to HPV vaccine among mothers with a teenage daughter in Weihai, Shandong, China. A cross-sectional survey was conducted in 2013 with a sample of 1850 mothers who had a daughter (aged 9-17 years) attending primary, junior and senior high schools. In the final sample (N = 1578, response rate 85.30%), awareness of HPV was reported by 305 (19.32%) mothers. Awareness varied significantly by daughter's age (P<0.01), mother's education level (P<0.01), mother's occupation (P<0.01), household income (P<0.01) and residence type (P<0.01). Knowledge about HPV/HPV vaccine was poor with a mean total score of 3.56 (SD = 2.40) out of a possible score of 13. Mothers with a higher education level reported higher levels of knowledge (P = 0.02). Slightly more than one-fourth (26.49%) of mothers expressed their potential acceptability of HPV vaccine for their daughters. Acceptability increased along with increased daughters' age (P<0.01), household income (P<0.01) and knowledge level (P<0.01). House wives and unemployed mothers had the highest acceptability (P<0.01). The most common reasons for not accepting HPV vaccination were ""My daughter is too young to have risk of cervical cancer (30.95%)"", ""The vaccine has not been widely used, and the decision will be made after it is widely used (24.91%)"", ""Worry about the safety of the vaccine (22.85%)"". Awareness and knowledge of HPV/HPV vaccines are poor and HPV vaccine acceptability is low among these Chinese mothers. These results may help inform appropriate health education programs in this population."

Under diabetic conditions, the DRG is subjected to tissue ischemia or lower ambient oxygen tension that leads to aberrant metabolic functions. Metabolic dysfunctions have been documented to play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of diverse pain hypersensitivities. However, the contribution of diabetes-induced metabolic dysfunctions in the DRG to the pathogenesis of painful diabetic neuropathy remains ill-explored. In this study, we report that pyruvate dehydrogenase kinases (PDK2 and PDK4), key regulatory enzymes in glucose metabolism, mediate glycolytic metabolic shift in the DRG leading to painful diabetic neuropathy. Streptozotocin-induced diabetes substantially enhanced the expression and activity of the PDKs in the DRG, and the genetic ablation of Pdk2 and Pdk4 attenuated the hyperglycemia-induced pain hypersensitivity. Mechanistically, Pdk2/4 deficiency inhibited the diabetes-induced lactate surge, expression of pain-related ion channels, activation of satellite glial cells, and infiltration of macrophages in the DRG, in addition to reducing central sensitization and neuroinflammation hallmarks in the spinal cord, which probably accounts for the attenuated pain hypersensitivity. Pdk2/4-deficient mice were partly resistant to the diabetes-induced loss of peripheral nerve structure and function. Furthermore, in the experiments using DRG neuron cultures, lactic acid treatment enhanced the expression of the ion channels and compromised cell viability. Finally, the pharmacological inhibition of DRG PDKs or lactic acid production substantially attenuated diabetes-induced pain hypersensitivity.

Aqueous humor samples were obtained at the start of surgery. Aqueous cytokine levels were determined using a multiplex immunoassay (xMAP and the Human Cytokine/Chemokine Panel I).In UG cases, mean interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, monocyte chemotactic protein (MCP)-1, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-AA, PDGF-AB/BB, and VEGF levels were 171.1, 214.5, 2791.7, 3.5, 23.9, 5.4, and 168.9 pg/mL, respectively, and were higher than those in cataract (non-glaucomatous) cases except PDGF. Levels of IL-6, MCP-1, and VEGF were higher in UG cases than in POAG cases. UG cases with a history of phacoemulsification displayed significantly higher levels of IL-6 (P = 0.0164), IL-8 (P = 0.0003), MCP-1 (P = 0.0465), and PDGF-AB/BB (P = 0.0062) compared to the phakic cases. The presence of cells in the anterior chamber was related to higher levels of IL-8 (P = 0.0002), TNF-α (P = 0.0037), and PDGF-AB/BB (P = 0.0009). The level of PDGF-AB/BB was higher in infectious uveitis than in non-infectious uveitis (P = 0.0211). The level of transforming growth factor (TGF)-β2 was negatively correlated with the levels of MCP-1 (adjusted R2 = 0.28, t = -2.45, P = 0.031) and TNF-α (adjusted R2 = 0.27, t = -2.43, P = 0.032).A history of phacoemulsification, the presence of cells in the anterior chamber, and infectious uveitis were related to aqueous proinflammatory cytokine levels in patients with UG.

https://openalex.org/W2267879309,"The Helicopter Emergency Medical Service (HEMS) was established for the prehospital trauma care of patients. Improved rescue times and increased coverage areas are discussed as specific advantages of HEMS. We recently found evidence that HEMS exerts beneficial effects on outcomes for severely injured patients. However, it still remains unknown which group of trauma patients might benefit most from HEMS rescue. Consequently, the unique aim of this study was to reveal which patients might benefit most from HEMS rescue.Trauma patients (ISS ≥9) primarily treated by HEMS or ground emergency medical services (GEMS) between 2002 and 2012 were analysed using the TraumaRegister DGU. A multivariate regression analysis was used to reveal the survival benefit between different trauma populations.The study included 52 281 trauma patients. Of these, 68.8% (35 974) were rescued by GEMS and 31.2% (16 307) by HEMS. HEMS patients were more severely injured compared to GEMS patients (ISS: HEMS 24.8±13.5 vs. GEMS 21.7±18.0) and more frequently suffered traumatic shock (SBP sys <90mmHg: HEMS 18.3% vs. GEMS 14.8%). However, logistic regression analysis revealed that HEMS rescues resulted in an overall survival benefit compared to GEMS (OR 0.81, 95% CI [0.75-0.87], p<0.001, Nagelkerke's R squared 0.526, area under the ROC curve 0.922, 95% CI [0.919-0.925]). Analysis of specific subgroups demonstrated that patients aged older than 55 years (OR 0.62, 95% CI [0.50-0.77]) had the highest survival benefit after HEMS treatment. Furthermore, HEMS rescue had the most significant impact after 'low falls' (OR 0.68, 95% CI [0.55-0.84]) and in the case of minor severity injuries (ISS 9-15) (OR 0.66, 95% CI [0.49-0.88]).In general, trauma patients benefit from HEMS rescue with in-hospital survival as the main outcome parameter. Focusing on special subgroups, middle aged and older patients, low-energy trauma, and minor severity injuries had the highest survival benefit when rescued by HEMS. Further studies are required to determine the potential reasons of this benefit."
https://openalex.org/W2416791490,"Many emerging cell-based therapies are based on pluripotent stem cells, though complete understanding of the properties of these cells is lacking. In these cells, much is still unknown about the cytoskeletal network, which governs the mechanoresponse. The objective of this study was to determine the cytoskeletal state in undifferentiated pluripotent stem cells and remodeling with differentiation. Mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and reprogrammed induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), as well as the original un-reprogrammed embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), were evaluated for expression of cytoskeletal markers. We found that pluripotent stem cells overall have a less developed cytoskeleton compared to fibroblasts. Gene and protein expression of smooth muscle cell actin, vimentin, lamin A, and nestin were markedly lower for ESCs than MEFs. Whereas, iPSC samples were heterogeneous with most cells expressing patterns of cytoskeletal proteins similar to ESCs with a small subpopulation similar to MEFs. This indicates that dedifferentiation during reprogramming is associated with cytoskeletal remodeling to a less developed state. In differentiation studies, it was found that shear stress-mediated differentiation resulted in an increase in expression of cytoskeletal intermediate filaments in ESCs, but not in iPSC samples. In the embryoid body model of spontaneous differentiation of pluripotent stem cells, however, both ESCs and iPSCs had similar gene expression for cytoskeletal proteins during early differentiation. With further differentiation, however, gene levels were significantly higher for iPSCs compared to ESCs. These results indicate that reprogrammed iPSCs more readily reacquire cytoskeletal proteins compared to the ESCs that need to form the network de novo. The strategic selection of the parental phenotype is thus critical not only in the context of reprogramming but also the ultimate functionality of the iPSC-differentiated cell population. Overall, this increased characterization of the cytoskeleton in pluripotent stem cells will allow for the better understanding and design of stem cell-based therapies."
https://openalex.org/W2234536314,"Conventional protocols for differentiating human induced-pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) into smooth-muscle cells (SMCs) can be inefficient and generally fail to yield cells with a specific SMC phenotype (i.e., contractile or synthetic SMCs). Here, we present two novel hiPSC-SMC differentiation protocols that yield SMCs with predominantly contractile or synthetic phenotypes. Flow cytometry analyses of smooth-muscle actin (SMA) expression indicated that ~45% of the cells obtained with each protocol assumed an SMC phenotype, and that the populations could be purified to ~95% via metabolic selection. Assessments of cellular mRNA and/or protein levels indicated that SMA, myosin heavy chain II, collagen 1, calponin, transgelin, connexin 43, and vimentin expression in the SMCs obtained via the Contractile SMC protocol and in SMCs differentiated via a traditional protocol were similar, while SMCs produced via the Sythetic SMC protocol expressed less calponin, more collagen 1, and more connexin 43. Differences were also observed in functional assessments of the two SMC populations: the two-dimensional surface area of Contractile SMCs declined more extensively (to 12% versus 44% of original size) in response to carbachol treatment, while quantification of cell migration and proliferation were greater in Synthetic SMCs. Collectively, these data demonstrate that our novel differentiation protocols can efficiently generate SMCs from hiPSCs."
https://openalex.org/W2239620465,"There are two independent serotonin (5-HT) systems of organization: one in the central nervous system and the other in the periphery. 5-HT affects feeding behavior and obesity in the central nervous system. On the other hand, peripheral 5-HT also may play an important role in obesity, as it has been reported that 5-HT regulates glucose and lipid metabolism. Here we show that the intraperitoneal injection of 5-HT to mice inhibits weight gain, hyperglycemia and insulin resistance and completely prevented the enlargement of intra-abdominal adipocytes without having any effect on food intake when on a high fat diet, but not on a chow diet. 5-HT increased energy expenditure, O2 consumption and CO2 production. This novel metabolic effect of peripheral 5-HT is critically related to a shift in the profile of muscle fiber type from fast/glycolytic to slow/oxidative in soleus muscle. Additionally, 5-HT dramatically induced an increase in the mRNA expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor coactivator 1α (PGC-1α)-b and PGC-1α-c in soleus muscle. The elevation of these gene mRNA expressions by 5-HT injection was inhibited by treatment with 5-HT receptor (5HTR) 2A or 7 antagonists. Our results demonstrate that peripheral 5-HT may play an important role in the relief of obesity and other metabolic disorders by accelerating energy consumption in skeletal muscle."
https://openalex.org/W2237111586,"Due to the capacity of the amniotic membrane (Am) to support re-epithelisation and inhibit scar formation, Am has a potential to become a considerable asset for reconstructive urology i.e., reconstruction of ureters and urethrae. The application of Am in reconstructive urology is limited due to a poor mechanical characteristic. Am reinforcement with electrospun nanofibers offers a new strategy to improve Am mechanical resistance, without affecting its unique bioactivity profile. This study evaluated biocomposite material composed of Am and nanofibers as a graft for urinary bladder augmentation in a rat model.Sandwich-structured biocomposite material was constructed from frozen Am and covered on both sides with two-layered membranes prepared from electrospun poly-(L-lactide-co-E-caprolactone) (PLCL). Wistar rats underwent hemicystectomy and bladder augmentation with the biocomposite material.Immunohistohemical analysis (hematoxylin and eosin [H&E], anti-smoothelin and Masson's trichrome staining [TRI]) revealed effective regeneration of the urothelial and smooth muscle layers. Anti-smoothelin staining confirmed the presence of contractile smooth muscle within a new bladder wall. Sandwich-structured biocomposite graft material was designed to regenerate the urinary bladder wall, fulfilling the requirements for normal bladder tension, contraction, elasticity and compliance. Mechanical evaluation of regenerated bladder wall conducted based on Young's elastic modulus reflected changes in the histological remodeling of the augmented part of the bladder. The structure of the biocomposite material made it possible to deliver an intact Am to the area for regeneration. An unmodified Am surface supported regeneration of the urinary bladder wall and the PLCL membranes did not disturb the regeneration process.Am reinforcement with electrospun nanofibers offers a new strategy to improve Am mechanical resistance without affecting its unique bioactivity profile."

A dish-based 106-item semi-quantitative validated food frequency questionnaire (FFQ), General Practice Physical Activity Questionnaire (GPPAQ), General Health Questionnaire (GHQ) and other pre-tested questionnaires were used to assess the components of healthy lifestyle score. The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) was applied to screen for anxiety and depression.After adjustment for potential confounders, we found that individuals with the highest score of healthy lifestyle were 95% less likely to be anxious (OR: 0.05; 95% CI: 0.01-0.27) and 96% less likely to be depressed (OR: 0.04; 95% CI: 0.01-0.15), compared with those with the lowest score. In addition, non-smokers had lower odds of anxiety (OR: 0.64; 95% CI: 0.47-0.88) and depression (OR: 0.62; 95% CI: 0.48-0.81) compared with smokers. Individuals with low levels of psychological distress had expectedly lower odds of anxiety (OR: 0.13; 95% CI: 0.10-0.16) and depression (OR: 0.10; 95% CI: 0.08-0.12) than those with high levels. Individuals with a healthy diet had 29% lower odds of depression (OR: 0.71; 95% CI: 0.59-0.87) than those with a non-healthy diet.We found evidence indicating that healthy lifestyle score was associated with lower odds of anxiety and depression in this group of Iranian adults. Healthy diet, psychological distress, and smoking status were independent predictors of mental disorders."
https://openalex.org/W2302154609,"Purpose Diabetes mellitus is an increasingly common systemic disease. Many diabetic patients seek cataract surgery for a better visual acuity. Unlike in the general population, the influence of cataract surgery on tear film function in diabetic patients remains elusive. The aim of this study was to evaluate the tear function in diabetic and nondiabetic patients following cataract surgery. Methods In this prospective, interventional case series, 174 diabetic patients without dry eye syndrome (DES) and 474 age-matched nondiabetic patients as control who underwent phacoemulsification were enrolled at two different eye centers between January 2011 and January 2013. Patients were followed up at baseline and at 7 days, 1 month, and 3 months postoperatively. Ocular symptom scores (Ocular Surface Disease Index, OSDI) and tear film function including tear film stability (tear film break-up time, TBUT), corneal epithelium integrity (corneal fluorescein staining, CFS), and tear secretion (Schirmer’s I test, SIT) were evaluated. Results In total, 83.9% of the diabetic patients (146 cases with 185 eyes) and 89.0% of the nondiabetic patients (422 cases with 463 eyes) completed all check-ups after the interventions (P = 0.095). The incidence of DES was 17.1% in the diabetic patients and 8.1% in the nondiabetic patients at 7 days after cataract surgery. In the diabetic patients, the incidence of DES remained 4.8% at 1 month postoperatively and decreased to zero at 3 months after surgery. No DES was diagnosed in nondiabetic patients at either the 1-month or 3-month follow-up. Compared with the baseline, the diabetic patients had worse symptom scores and lower TBUT values at 7 days and 1 month but not at 3 months postoperatively. In the nondiabetic patients, symptom scores and TBUT values had returned to preoperative levels at 1-month check-up. CFS scores and SIT values did not change significantly postoperatively in either group (P = 0.916 and P = 0.964, respectively). Conclusions Diabetic patients undergoing cataract surgery are prone to DES. Ocular symptoms and tear film stability are transiently worsened in diabetic patients and are restored more slowly than those in nondiabetic patients."
https://openalex.org/W2237216692,"Prostate cancer (PCa) mortality is driven by highly aggressive tumors characterized by metastasis and resistance to therapy, and this aggressiveness is mediated by numerous factors, including activation of stress survival pathways in the pro-inflammatory tumor microenvironment. LEDGF/p75, also known as the DFS70 autoantigen, is a stress transcription co-activator implicated in cancer, HIV-AIDS, and autoimmunity. This protein is targeted by autoantibodies in certain subsets of patients with PCa and inflammatory conditions, as well as in some apparently healthy individuals. LEDGF/p75 is overexpressed in PCa and other cancers, and promotes resistance to chemotherapy-induced cell death via the transactivation of survival proteins. We report in this study that overexpression of LEDGF/p75 in PCa cells attenuates oxidative stress-induced necrosis but not staurosporine-induced apoptosis. This finding was consistent with the observation that while LEDGF/p75 was robustly cleaved in apoptotic cells into a p65 fragment that lacks stress survival activity, it remained relatively intact in necrotic cells. Overexpression of LEDGF/p75 in PCa cells led to the upregulation of transcript and protein levels of the thiol-oxidoreductase ERp57 (also known as GRP58 and PDIA3), whereas its depletion led to ERp57 transcript downregulation. Chromatin immunoprecipitation and transcription reporter assays showed LEDGF/p75 binding to and transactivating the ERp57 promoter, respectively. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed significantly elevated co-expression of these two proteins in clinical prostate tumor tissues. Our results suggest that LEDGF/p75 is not an inhibitor of apoptosis but rather an antagonist of oxidative stress-induced necrosis, and that its overexpression in PCa leads to ERp57 upregulation. These findings are of significance in clarifying the role of the LEDGF/p75 stress survival pathway in PCa."

Fucosyltransferase (FUT) 2 and FUT3 determine expression of histo-blood group antigens in the gut and may affect the intestinal microbiota. We investigated the association between FUT2 and FUT3 polymorphisms and UC in Chinese patients.We genotyped FUT2 (rs281377, rs1047781 and rs601338) and FUT3 (rs28362459, rs3745635 and rs3894326) in 485 UC patients and 580 healthy controls using SNaPshot. We also evaluated expression of Lewis a and b antigens in the sigmoid colon of 7 UC patients and 7 patients with benign colonic polyps.The frequencies of mutant allele (A) and genotype (GA+AA) in FUT3 (rs3745635) were higher in UC patients than controls (P = 0.016, 95%CI: 1.339-1.699; P = 0.038, 95%CI: 1.330-1.742, respectively). Stratified analyses revealed that the frequencies of mutant allele (G) and genotype (TG+GG) of FUT3 (rs28362459) were significantly lower in patients with extensive colitis than those with distal colitis (P<0.001, 95%CI: 0.503-0.742; P = 0.001, 95%CI: 0.567-0.786, respectively). Similar conclusions were drawn for the mutant allele (A) and genotype (GA+AA) of FUT3 (rs3745635) in patients with extensive colitis compared to those with distal colitis (P = 0.006, 95%CI: 0.553-0.845; P = 0.011, 95%CI: 0.621-0.900, respectively). Although expression of Lewis b antigen in the sigmoid colon did not differ between UC patients and controls, Lewis a antigen expression was higher in the cryptic epithelium of both inflammatory and non-inflammatory sigmoid colon of UC patients than controls (P = 0.028).Our findings indicated that polymorphisms in FUT3 and its intestinal expression might be associated with UC pathogenesis."

M gene RT-PCRs showed that 28.36% (57/201) of the samples were positive for CCoV; of the 57 positive samples, CCoV-I and CCoV-II accounted for 15.79% (9/57) and 84.21% (48/57), respectively. A sequence comparison of the partial M gene revealed nucleotide homologies of 88.4%–100% among the 57 CCoV strains, and 88.7%–96.2% identity between the 57 CCoV strains and the Chinese reference strain HF3. The CCoV-I and CCoV-II strains exhibited genetic diversity when compared with reference strains from China and other countries. The 57 CCoV strains exhibited high co-infection rates with canine kobuvirus (CaKV) (33.33%) and canine parvovirus-2 (CPV-2) (31.58%). The CCoV prevalence in diarrheic dogs differed significantly with immunization status, regions, seasons, and ages. Moreover, 28 S genes were amplified from the 57 CCoV-positive samples, including 26 CCoV-IIa strains, one CCoV-IIb strain, and one CCoV-I strain. A sequence comparison of the partial S gene revealed 86.3%–100% nucleotide identity among the 26 CCoV-IIa strains, and 89.6%–92.2% identity between the 26 CCoV-IIa strains and the Chinese reference strain V1. The 26 CCoV-IIa strains showed genetic diversity when compared with reference strains from China and other countries. Our data provide evidence that CCoV-I, CCoV-IIa, and CCoV-IIb strains co-circulate in the diarrhoetic dogs in northeast China, high co-infection rates with CaKV and CPV-2 were observed, and the CCoV-II strains exhibited high prevalence and genetic diversity."

The synthesized nanoparticles and the prepared column were characterized by transmission electron microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, infrared spectroscopy and ultraviolet visible spectroscopy. When the column was employed as the chiral stationary phase, no enantioselectivity was observed for ten model basic drugs. So β-cyclodextrin was added to the background electrolyte as chiral additive to expect a possible synergistic effect occurring and resulting in a better separation. Fortunately, significant improvement in enantioselectivity was obtained for ten pairs of drug enantiomers. Then, the effects of β-cyclodextrin concentration and background electrolyte pH on the chiral separation were investigated. With the developed separation mode, all the enantiomers (except for venlafaxine) were baseline separated in resolutions of 4.49, 1.68, 1.88, 1.57, 2.52, 2.33, 3.24, 1.63 and 3.90 for zopiclone, chlorphenamine maleate, brompheniramine maleate, dioxopromethazine hydrochloride, carvedilol, homatropine hydrobromide, homatropine methylbromide, venlafaxine, sibutramine hydrochloride and terbutaline sulfate, respectively.

https://openalex.org/W2344903328,"Various drugs have been developed to treat obesity, but these have undesirable secondary effects, and an efficient but non-toxic anti-obesity drug from natural sources is desired. This study investigated the anti-obesity effects and mechanisms of action of acetylshikonin (AS)—which is used in traditional Chinese medicine—in rats on a high-fat diet (HFD). Rats were fed a normal diet or an HFD; the latter group was received no treatment or were treated with 100, 300, or 900 mg/kg AS extract by intragastric administration for 6 weeks. In addition, 3T3-L1 adipocytes were treated with AS and the effects on adipogenesis and lipolysis were evaluated by western blot analysis of adipogenic transcription factors and lipid-metabolizing enzyme levels and the phosphorylation status of protein kinase (PK) A and hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL). AS prevented HFD-induced obesity including reduction in body weight, white adipose tissue content, liver mass, and serum triglyceride and free fatty acid levels in rats. It also suppressed the expression of adipogenic differentiation transcription factors and decreased the expression of the adipocyte-specific proteins HSL and adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL). Furthermore, AS treatment induced lipolysis, leading to the release of glycerol and increased in PKA and HSL phosphorylation. These findings demonstrate that AS has anti-obesity effects in a rat model and may be a safe treatment for obesity in humans."
https://openalex.org/W2240080088,"Background Although emergency resuscitative thoracotomy is performed as a salvage maneuver for critical blunt trauma patients, evidence supporting superior effectiveness of emergency resuscitative thoracotomy compared to conventional closed-chest compressions remains insufficient. The objective of this study was to investigate whether emergency resuscitative thoracotomy at the emergency department or in the operating room was associated with favourable outcomes after blunt trauma and to compare its effectiveness with that of closed-chest compressions. Methods This was a retrospective nationwide cohort study. Data were obtained from the Japan Trauma Data Bank for the period between 2004 and 2012. The primary and secondary outcomes were patient survival rates 24 h and 28 d after emergency department arrival. Statistical analyses were performed using multivariable generalized mixed-effects regression analysis. We adjusted for the effects of different hospitals by introducing random intercepts in regression analysis to account for the differential quality of emergency resuscitative thoracotomy at hospitals where patients in cardiac arrest were treated. Sensitivity analyses were performed using propensity score matching. Results In total, 1,377 consecutive, critical blunt trauma patients who received cardiopulmonary resuscitation in the emergency department or operating room were included in the study. Of these patients, 484 (35.1%) underwent emergency resuscitative thoracotomy and 893 (64.9%) received closed-chest compressions. Compared to closed-chest compressions, emergency resuscitative thoracotomy was associated with lower survival rate 24 h after emergency department arrival (4.5% vs. 17.5%, respectively, P < 0.001) and 28 d after arrival (1.2% vs. 6.0%, respectively, P < 0.001). Multivariable generalized mixed-effects regression analysis with and without a propensity score-matched dataset revealed that the odds ratio for an unfavorable survival rate after 24 h was lower for emergency resuscitative thoracotomy than for closed-chest compressions (P < 0.001). Conclusions Emergency resuscitative thoracotomy was independently associated with decreased odds of a favorable survival rate compared to closed-chest compressions."

The basic regulatory mechanisms of substrate specificity and developmental control in RNA editing remain unknown. The uridylate changes are catalyzed by the RECC enzyme from 3′ to 5′ in discrete blocks. Each gRNA directs editing of one mRNA block. Surprisingly, RECC has little or no RNA and lacks the processivity found in vivo, as established in early purifications of this multiprotein enzyme (4Rusché L.N. Cruz-Reyes J. Piller K.J.

So, accessory components of the editing apparatus must facilitate substrate recruitment and editing catalysis. There are many non-RECC proteins that affect editing. Most of these proteins (>25 proteins) are components of the MRB1 complex in T. brucei, also termed gRNA-binding complex (GRBC) in Leishmania, that binds and stabilizes gRNA. MRB1 interacts transiently with the RECC enzyme and mitoribosomes (1Cruz-Reyes J. Read L.K. Maas S. RNA Editing: Current Research and Future Trends.

Transient addition of RECC to these scaffolds would establish higher-order editing holoenzymes or editosomes. MRB1 was first considered a single dynamic complex, but the reason of its variable composition was unclear. However, layers of organization in MRB1 are emerging. We found MRB1 variants or MRBs (REH2-MRB and 3010-MRB) via immunoprecipitation (IP) of RNA-editing helicase 2 (REH2) and MRB3010 (3010), respectively.

Other proposed subcomplexes of MRBs are REMC (typified by RGG2) and the polyadenylation mediator complex.

As the physical organization of MRBs becomes clearer, specialized subcomplexes and critical domains in their subunits open a path to study editing control in substrate-bound molecular scaffolds. For example, the stable association of REH2 with mRNA and GRBC* requires the functional domains in the helicase for dsRNA binding and ATP binding/hydrolysis (11Madina B.R. Kumar V. Mooers B.H.

This study provides new insights into the assembly and regulation of higher-order editosomes, with REH2C playing a central role. REH2C is an mRNA-associated ribonucleoprotein subcomplex (mRNP) that includes REH2, two cofactors (H2F1 and H2F2), and all mRNA types in editing: pre-mRNA substrates, partially edited transcripts, and fully edited products. The integrity of this mRNP is independent of the GRBC variants. We propose that assembly of stable mRNA-gRNA hybrids in editing scaffolds requires docking of mRNP and gRNP modules by base pairing of mRNA and gRNA. The helicase mRNP binds stably with GRBC* but interacts with GRBC via transient contacts. Our homology modeling of REH2 revealed a conserved regulatory C-terminal domain cluster (CTD) in eukaryotic RHA-type helicases. This CTD includes winged helix, ratchet, and oligonucleotide-binding (OB) fold domains. H2F1 has eight putative Cys2His2 zinc fingers potentially involved in dsRNA or protein binding. H2F2 has a glycine-rich C terminus. H2F1 depletion caused cis and trans effects. That is, H2F1 promotes GRBC* association with REH2, RECC, and pre-mRNA (in cis) and GRBC association with RECC and pre-mRNA (in trans). H2F1 depletion had no major effect on REH2-dependent unwinding of a synthetic short RNA duplex. However, it inhibited RNP formation with this RNA duplex in cis and in trans. Purified recombinant REH2 and H2F1 form a complex in vitro. The regulatory REH2 helicase and its eight-zinc finger H2F1 cofactor enable studies of mRNA-gRNA hybrid assembly and substrate access to RECC on molecular scaffolds. This stepwise process creates the catalytic center in editosomes and likely entails specificity checkpoints.

It binds to specific regions within target genes to regulate their expression and is downregulated upon induction of differentiation of pluripotent stem cells; however, the mechanisms that regulate the levels of human Oct4 expression remain poorly understood. Here we show that expression of human Oct4 is directly repressed by germ cell nuclear factor (GCNF), an orphan nuclear receptor, in hES cells. Knockdown of GCNF by siRNA resulted in maintenance of Oct4 expression during RA-induced hES cell differentiation. While overexpression of GCNF promoted repression of Oct4 expression in both undifferentiated and differentiated hES cells. The level of Oct4 repression was dependent on the level of GCNF expression in a dose-dependent manner. mRNA microarray analysis demonstrated that overexpression of GCNF globally regulates gene expression in undifferentiated and differentiated hES cells. Within the group of altered genes, GCNF down-regulated 36% of the genes, and up-regulated 64% in undifferentiated hES cells. In addition, GCNF also showed a regulatory gene pattern that is different from RA treatment during hES cell differentiation.

In this study, those antibodies were employed to isolate a heparin binding protein. MALDI mass spectrometry data provide evidence that the protein isolated is transmembrane protein 184A (TMEM184A). Commercial antibodies against three separate regions of the TMEM184A human protein were used to identify the TMEM184A protein in vascular smooth muscle cells and endothelial cells.

Knockdown of TMEM184A eliminated the physiological responses to heparin, including effects on ERK pathway activity and BrdU incorporation.

Biochem. 2003; 88: 1214-1225Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) indicate that receptor-mediated uptake of heparin or HS may also be critical for some heparin effects. Similarly, shed HSPG syndecan-1 can be taken up by cells and transported to the nucleus, where it alters histone acetylation (19Stewart M.D. Ramani V.C. Sanderson R.D. Shed syndecan-1 translocates to the nucleus of cells delivering growth factors and inhibiting histone acetylation: a novel mechanism of tumor-host cross-talk.J. Biol. Chem. 2015; 290: 941-949Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). HS chains are required for uptake, and this uptake can be inhibited by exogenously added heparin. It is likely that the uptake of highly charged heparin and HS chains involves a receptor to manage transport across the membrane. Although many heparin-interacting proteins have been linked to specific functions, a receptor responsible for heparin uptake has not been identified. In addition to heparin uptake into vascular cells, there is clear evidence for heparin/HS binding to growth factors, growth factor receptors, and matrix proteins. A systems analysis of heparin binding proteins suggests that many of the heparin-interacting proteins fall into clusters of proteins that are involved with interactions between cells and the extracellular space. Within that broad area, researchers identified clusters involved in control of the immune system, cell-cell communication, and control of proliferation (2Ori A. Wilkinson M.C. Fernig D.G. A systems biology approach for the investigation of the heparin/heparan sulfate interactome.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 19892-19904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Heparin and HS are structurally similar, having the same core repeating disaccharide and modifications. Heparin is a glycosaminoglycan, whereas HS typically remains bound to protein cores embedded in the membrane or the matrix (1Xu D. Esko J.D. Demystifying heparan sulfate-protein interactions.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2014; 83: 129-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar). In addition, heparin chains have higher levels of sulfation than HS, although both HS and heparin have regions of differing sulfation levels (1Xu D. Esko J.D. Demystifying heparan sulfate-protein interactions.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2014; 83: 129-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar). The interactions of heparin or HS with specific extracellular proteins are important in many functions. Therefore, it has often been difficult to assign effects of heparin/HS interactions to any one of these proteins without specific modifications to the heparin-interacting protein in question. In vivo, functions characterized as heparin-induced are actually likely to be carried out by one or more HSPGs. Because the many different HSPGs are ubiquitous and the presence of HS is evolutionarily conserved, it has been suggested that heparin binding proteins have actually evolved to interact with HSPGs and have, therefore, been termed HS binding proteins (1Xu D. Esko J.D. Demystifying heparan sulfate-protein interactions.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2014; 83: 129-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar). In the vasculature, interactions of HSPGs with growth factors and their receptors are crucial in angiogenesis as well as in vascular disease (20Chiodelli P. Bugatti A. Urbinati C. Rusnati M. Heparin/heparan sulfate proteoglycans glycomic interactome in angiogenesis: biological implications and therapeutical use.Molecules. 2015; 20: 6342-6388Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). HS/heparin interacts with both growth factors and their receptors and scaffolds proteins, facilitating growth factor dimerization and interaction between growth factors and their receptors (1Xu D. Esko J.D. Demystifying heparan sulfate-protein interactions.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2014; 83: 129-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar). The hypothesis that heparin could block HSPG interactions with growth factors and thereby decrease responses to growth factors provides one logical explanation for some of the heparin responses in vascular cells. This hypothesis is supported by studies that indicate transactivation of heparin-binding EGF receptors in response to G protein-coupled receptor activation (21Kalmes A. Daum G. Clowes A.W. EGFR transactivation in the regulation of SMC function.Ann. N.Y. Acad. Sci. 2001; 947 (discussion 54–45): 42-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Heparin has even been shown to inhibit angiotensin II-induced VSMC responses (22Xie-Zukauskas H. Das J. Short B.L. Gutkind J.S. Ray P.E. Heparin inhibits angiotensin II-induced vasoconstriction on isolated mouse mesenteric resistance arteries through Rho-A- and PKA-dependent pathways.Vascul. Pharmacol. 2013; 58: 313-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Continuing reports of HSPG requirements for cell proliferation in response to activation of additional G protein-coupled receptor systems further support the hypothesis that heparin effects are simply due to displacement of HSPG co-receptors (23Rauch B.H. Millette E. Kenagy R.D. Daum G. Fischer J.W. Clowes A.W. Syndecan-4 is required for thrombin-induced migration and proliferation in human vascular smooth muscle cells.J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 17507-17511Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). However, heparin interference with HSPG-growth factor interactions cannot explain all of the heparin effects on VSMCs. Specifically, it does not account for the fact that heparin treatment results in rapidly turning down cell responses rather than blocking them from starting (e.g. Refs. 10Savage J.M. Gilotti A.C. Granzow C.A. Molina F. Lowe-Krentz L.J. Antibodies against a heparin receptor slow cell proliferation and decrease MAPK activation in vascular smooth muscle cells.J. Cell.

Mechanisms of inhibition by heparin of PDGF stimulated MAP kinase activation in vascular smooth muscle cells.J. Cell. Physiol. 1997; 172: 69-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Nor does it address the fact that heparin decreases signaling even when initiated by phorbol esters (12Ottlinger M.E. Pukac L.A. Karnovsky M.J. Heparin inhibits mitogen-activated protein kinase activation in intact rat vascular smooth muscle cells.J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19173-19176Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Heparin induction of p27kip synthesis (15Fasciano S. Patel R.C. Handy I. Patel C.V.

Heparin treatment of vascular smooth muscle cells results in the synthesis of the dual-specificity phosphatase MKP-1.J. Cell. Biochem. 2010; 110: 382-391PubMed Google Scholar) also occurs directly in response to heparin treatment, and high-affinity heparin binding sites and heparin uptake likely involve interactions with a receptor other than growth factors. To identify and characterize a heparin binding protein(s) that could facilitate heparin uptake and other responses, we created mAbs that specifically block heparin binding to ECs (5Patton 2nd, W.A. Granzow C.A. Getts L.A. Thomas S.C. Zotter L.M. Gunzel K.A. Lowe-Krentz L.J. Identification of a heparin-binding protein using monoclonal antibodies that block heparin binding to porcine aortic endothelial cells.Biochem. J. 1995; 311: 461-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). These mAbs (HRmAbs) mimic many heparin effects, including blocking VSMC ERK activation and proliferation and inducing DUSP1 synthesis (10Savage J.M. Gilotti A.C. Granzow C.A. Molina F. Lowe-Krentz L.J. Antibodies against a heparin receptor slow cell proliferation and decrease MAPK activation in vascular smooth muscle cells.J. Cell.

Heparin treatment of vascular smooth muscle cells results in the synthesis of the dual-specificity phosphatase MKP-1.J. Cell. Biochem. 2010; 110: 382-391PubMed Google Scholar). These antibodies are able to immunoprecipitate a membrane protein from both ECs and VSMCs that is ∼45–50 kDa (5Patton 2nd, W.A. Granzow C.A. Getts L.A. Thomas S.C. Zotter L.M. Gunzel K.A. Lowe-Krentz L.J. Identification of a heparin-binding protein using monoclonal antibodies that block heparin binding to porcine aortic endothelial cells.Biochem.

Antibodies against a heparin receptor slow cell proliferation and decrease MAPK activation in vascular smooth muscle cells.J. Cell. Physiol. 2001; 187: 283-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). We have determined recently that both HRmAbs and heparin induce signaling through a cGMP-dependent protein kinase pathway to alter VSMC responses to growth factors (14Gilotti A.C. Nimlamool W. Pugh R. Slee J.B. Barthol T.C. Miller E.A. Lowe-Krentz L.J. Heparin responses in vascular smooth muscle cells involve cGMP dependent protein kinase.J. Cell. Physiol. 2014; 229: 2142-2152Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The antibodies and heparin also alter EC physiology by decreasing JNK and p38 activity and downstream signaling because of JNK and p38 activity (see the accompanying report (8Farwell S. Kanyi D. Hamel M. Slee J.B. Miller E. Cipolle M. Lowe-Krentz L. Heparin decreases in TNFα-induced endothelial stress responses require TMEM184A and induction of DUSP1.J. Biol. Chem. 2016; 291: 5342-5354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar)). These studies all suggest that the antibodies recognize and stimulate a receptor for heparin that exists on both VSMCs and ECs. To determine the identity of the protein to which the HRmAbs bind, we hypothesized that HRmAb immunoprecipitates of membrane proteins from vascular cells would contain the protein responsible for heparin effects. We employed both heparin affinity and HRmAb affinity chromatography of membrane proteins and then identified the immunoprecipitated protein. Here we report evidence that this procedure isolates the transmembrane protein identified as TMEM184A. Prior studies on TMEM184A are limited, but evidence indicates involvement of the protein in vesicle transport in exocrine cells and Sertoli cells of mice (25Best D. Adams I.R. Sdmg1 is a component of secretory granules in mouse secretory exocrine tissues.Dev. Dyn. 2009; 238: 223-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 26Best D. Sahlender D.A. Walther N. Peden A.A.

P8340 and P2714, used at the concentrations recommended by the manufacturer) and homogenized in a Dounce homogenizer, and then the supernatant was collected after centrifugation at 2000 × g for 10 min to remove nuclei and debris. The supernatant was centrifuged further at 28,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. All remaining purification steps also contained the protease inhibitor mixtures. The resulting membrane pellet was resuspended in PBS + 0.2% CHAPS. Three to four pellets were combined, and the 0.2% CHAPS/PBS-solubilized pellet was subjected to heparin affinity chromatography on heparin-agarose. The heparin column was washed with at least five column volumes of 0.2% CHAPS/PBS until the A280 reached a baseline absorbance. Heparin-binding proteins were eluted with 1 m NaCl in 0.2% CHAPS/PBS. The eluate was concentrated using an Amicon Ultra-15 centrifugal filter unit (Millipore, Billerica, MA) with a molecular weight cutoff of 10,000 and exchanged into 0.2% CHAPS/PBS, and then the protein concentration was determined using a Lowry assay.

Excess biotin was removed by washing several times with PBS. The biotinylated antibodies were allowed to bind 1.0 ml of streptavidin-modified magnetic beads (Pierce) with gentle shaking at 25 °C for 1 h. To remove any unbound material, the antibody-magnetic bead solution was washed several times with 0.2% CHAPS/PBS. 1 ml of the eluted material from the heparin affinity column was added to the antibody-modified magnetic beads and incubated with gentle shaking at 25 °C for 1 h. The beads were localized to the side of the incubation tube using a magnet, and the supernatant was removed. After several washings with 0.2% CHAPS/PBS (removal of all unbound protein was verified by measuring baseline absorbance at A280 in the washings), the magnetic beads were eluted with a 1 m NaCl, 0.2% CHAPS/PBS solution. The eluted material was concentrated using a Centricon-20 plus or an Amicon Ultra-15 centrifugal filter unit (Millipore) with a molecular weight cutoff of 10,000 and exchanged into 0.2% CHAPS/PBS. To exchange receptor protein out of CHAPS, trichloroacetic acid was added to 10% (v/v), and the precipitated protein was pelleted by centrifugation. TCA precipitates were processed as noted below. Approximately 10 μg of TCA-precipitated protein was solubilized in 2× sample buffer and brought to a pH of 8.5 by addition of 1 m Tris buffer (pH 8.8). SDS-PAGE was carried out using the Laemmli system. Direct staining of PAGE gels was accomplished with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R250 or with SYPRO® Ruby (Sigma). For immunoblotting, gels were transferred, and total protein was stained with colloidal gold (Bio-Rad). For preparative gels, entire TCA-precipitated samples were solubilized and separated as above, and gels were stained with SYPRO Ruby, which does not interfere with additional digestion or analysis. For analysis of the intact protein from an acrylamide gel slice, the gel slice was destained at room temperature (22–23 °C) in aqueous 50% methanol/5% acetic acid overnight. The gel slice was then dehydrated with acetonitrile until the slice curled. The slice was then crushed in 100 μl of 100 mm NH4HCO3 and incubated at room temperature for 1 h. The supernatant was removed to a new tube, the extraction of the crushed slice was repeated, and the combined extracts were lyophilized to dryness. Matrix A (a saturated solution of sinapinic acid (Sigma) in 50% acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid) was added to the dried sample, and the resulting solution was spotted (2 × 0.75 μl) on a ground stainless steel target and analyzed using a Bruker Microflex MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer (positive/linear ion mode, at least 100 laser shots, minimum laser power of 60%, 500-ns delayed ion extraction). MALDI was also performed on a solution sample of the detergent-solubilized, antibody-purified heparin receptor. A heparan receptor sample (500 μl) was subjected to precipitation with cold acetone (−20 °C, overnight). The pellet was redissolved in 10 μl of matrix A. The supernatant from the acetone precipitation was lyophilized to dryness and resuspended in 10 μl of matrix A.

https://openalex.org/W2259468198,"The description of transcriptional regulatory networks has been pivotal in the understanding of operating principles under which organisms respond and adapt to varying conditions. While the study of the topology and dynamics of these networks has been the subject of considerable work, the investigation of the evolution of their topology, as a result of the adaptation of organisms to different environmental conditions, has received little attention. In this work, we study the evolution of transcriptional regulatory networks in bacteria from a genome reduction perspective, which manifests itself as the loss of genes at different degrees. We used the transcriptional regulatory network of Escherichia coli as a reference to compare 113 smaller, phylogenetically-related γ-proteobacteria, including 19 genomes of symbionts. We found that the type of regulatory action exerted by transcription factors, as genomes get progressively smaller, correlates well with their degree of conservation, with dual regulators being more conserved than repressors and activators in conditions of extreme reduction. In addition, we found that the preponderant conservation of dual regulators might be due to their role as both global regulators and nucleoid-associated proteins. We summarize our results in a conceptual model of how each TF type is gradually lost as genomes become smaller and give a rationale for the order in which this phenomenon occurs."

For almost 100 years heparin has been used as an anticoagulant. Specific heparin interactions with proteins important in the anti-clotting system are now well understood. Many heparin binding proteins, including quite a few involved in modulating vascular function, inflammation, and angiogenesis, have been identified (reviewed in Ref. 1Chiodelli P. Bugatti A.

The large number of reports indicating evidence of decreased endogenous heparin and heparan sulfates (HS) 3The abbreviations used are: HS, heparan sulfate(s); HSPG, heparan sulfate proteoglycan; VSMC, vascular smooth muscle cell; HRmAb, mAb that blocks heparin binding to vascular cells; EC, endothelial cell; NTD, commercial antibody to the amino-terminal domain of TMEM184A; TRITC, tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate; BAOEC, bovine aortic endothelial cell; RAOEC, rat aortic endothelial cell; HBMEC, human brain microvascular endothelial cell; TNFα, tumor necrosis factor α. in atherosclerosis (in model animals and human disease) led to a proposal that decreases in endogenous heparins might be important in the development of atherosclerosis (2Engelberg H. Endogenous heparin activity deficiency: the “missing link” in atherogenesis?.Atherosclerosis. 2001; 159: 253-260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). More recent evidence in support of that hypothesis includes increased heparanase expression in atherosclerosis (reviewed in Ref. 3Vlodavsky I. Blich M. Li J.-P. Sanderson R.D. Ilan N. Involvement of heparanase in atherosclerosis and other vessel wall pathologies.Matrix Biol. 2013; 32: 241-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) and increased levels of glycocalyx heparan sulfate in regions of the vasculature where laminar flow decreases the likelihood of atherosclerosis development (4Koo A. Dewey Jr., C.F. García-Cardeña G. Hemodynamic shear stress characteristic of atherosclerosis-resistant regions promotes glycocalyx formation in cultured endothelial cells.Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2013; 304: C137-C146Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). In addition to heparin, heparin binding proteins typically also bind HS chains on HS proteoglycans (HSPGs). Although the carbohydrate backbones of heparin and HS are identical, modifications and sulfation patterns vary. HS chains have fewer sulfate residues per disaccharide and a lower overall charge, but their widespread expression suggests that HS may provide many in vivo functions identified originally as heparin functions (reviewed in Ref. 5Xu D. Esko J.D. Demystifying heparan sulfate-protein interactions.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2014; 83: 129-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar). Heparin binding to growth factors modulates their activity and appears to protect them from degradation, whereas HSPGs in the extracellular matrix serve as a reservoir of protected growth factors believed to facilitate wound repair after cellular damage (1Chiodelli P.

Here we report evidence that unfractionated heparin treatment of ECs results in decreased JNK and p38 activity and that HRmAbsmimic heparin effects on JNK and p38 activity. The heparin effects on JNK and p38 depend on increased DUSP1 expression. Heparin effects on TNFα-induced stress fiber formation also depend on the induction of DUSP1. Furthermore, knockdown of TMEM184A blocks EC heparin responses and indicates that TMEM184A also serves as a receptor for heparin in ECs. TNFα was obtained from GenScript (Piscataway, NJ). Primary antibodies against JNK1/3 (catalog no. sc-474), phosphorylated JNK (pJNK; catalog no. sc-6254-mouse, used in microscopy and Western blotting; catalog no. sc-12882-goat, used in Western blotting), p38 (catalog no. sc-535), DUSP1 (MKP-1, catalog nos. sc-370 and sc-1199, used interchangeably), α-tubulin (catalog no. sc-398103), phosphorylated HSP27 (pHSP27, catalog no. sc-12923), phosphorylated c-jun (pcJun, catalog no. sc-31675), phosphorylated MAPK-activated protein kinase 2 (pMK2, sc-31675), and TMEM184A against an amino-terminal domain (NTD, catalog no. sc-292006) were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Antibodies to phosphorylated p38 (pp38, catalog nos. 9211 and 9216) were obtained from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). HRmAbs were isolated and purified as reported previously (10Patton 2nd, W.A. Granzow C.A. Getts L.A. Thomas S.C. Zotter L.M. Gunzel K.A. Lowe-Krentz L.J.

Secondary antibodies conjugated to tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate (TRITC), Alexa Fluor 488, Alexa Fluor 594, Cy3, and Alexa Fluor 647 (in donkey or bovine with minimal cross-reactivity) were obtained from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories (West Grove, PA). Unfractionated heparin, non-IgG endotoxin-tested BSA, and TRITC-phalloidin were obtained from Sigma. Alexa Fluor 488 phalloidin was obtained from Invitrogen. Bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAOECs) and rat aortic endothelial cells (RAOECs), obtained from Cell Applications (San Diego, CA), were cultured using Cell Applications media according to their recommendations on 0.2% porcine gelatin and exchanged into minimum Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen or Atlanta Biologicals, Atlanta, GA), 5% l-glutamine, 1% sodium pyruvate, 1% minimum non-essential amino acids, and 1% penicillin/streptomycin antibiotics (Sigma). Human brain microvascular endothelial cells (HBMECs) were obtained from Cell Systems (Kirkland, WA) and cultured using Cell Systems complete medium according to their recommendations or minimum Eagle's medium after exchange into minimum Eagle's medium supplemented identically to the BAOEC culture. Typically, primary cells between passages 4 and 25 were used for these experiments. For microscopy, cells were cultured to between 70% and 90% confluence on glass coverslips coated with 0.2% porcine gelatin (Sigma) in 6-well culture dishes. Cells were grown to the desired density on 100-mm tissue culture dishes and treated with stressing agents, heparin, and/or HRmAbs, as noted in the text. Cell samples were harvested directly into 2× sample buffer (11Dougherty C.S. Lowe-Krentz L.J. Heparin increases protein S levels in cultured endothelial cells by causing a block in degradation.J.

Secondary antibodies conjugated to Alexa Fluor 488, Alexa Fluor 594, Alexa Fluor 647, or TRITC (diluted 1:5000) were incubated with the blots, and visualization of the bands was accomplished by fluorescence detection using the Bio-Rad ChemiDoc MP system (catalog no. 170-8280). Bands of interest were identified by comparison with lanes developed using only secondary antibodies and by molecular weight on the basis of migration of prestained RainbowTM molecular weight markers (GE Healthcare LifeSciences). The blots are representative of at least three experiments. BAOECs, RAOECs, and HBMECs were fixed with 4.0% paraformaldehyde (Pierce) for 20 min at room temperature with gentle shaking and permeabilized with 0.2% Triton-X-100 (Sigma) for 5 min at room temperature with gentle shaking. Coverslips were incubated with 1% BSA for 30 min at room temperature with gentle shaking. Coverslips were incubated with appropriate primary antibodies overnight at 4 °C, washed with 1× PBS, and incubated with appropriate secondary antibodies for 1 h at 37 °C. Primary and secondary antibodies were used at the recommended optimized dilutions (1:200 or 1:100 for bovine anti-goat conjugated with Alexa Fluor 488, TRITC, and Alexa Fluor 594 or 1:50 for bovine anti-goat conjugated to Alexa Fluor 647). Phalloidin staining used a dilution 1:200. Coverslips were washed with 1× PBS and mounted on Mowiol (Calbiochem, Billerica, MA) to minimize photobleaching. Secondary antibody-only controls were performed to rule out nonspecific staining (data not shown). Fluorescent labels were visualized using a Zeiss laser-scanning microscope (510 Meta confocal microscope with a ×63 oil immersion lens) at room temperature. Stress fiber images in TMEM184A knockdown cells were taken with a Nikon C2+ confocal microscope (×60 oil immersion lens). The gain intensity and amplifier settings for each channel were set at a level below saturation and appropriate to provide a dynamic range of intensity for pp38, pJNK, pcJun, pMK2, pHSP27, and DUSP1 using control slides from initial experiments. The gain intensity and amplifier settings for Alexa Fluor 488-phalloidin were set by scanning to approximately the same Z plane in control cells where both the intensity and resolution of stress fibers were optimal. All settings were saved and used to image each sample slide within an experiment and for slides in all subsequent repeats of experiments. Z stacks were taken for all slides. All images of DUSP1 and actin stress fibers represent approximately the same Z plane of each cell. BAOECs were cultured to confluence in 100-mm plates. Cells were trypsinized, washed with 1× PBS, washed with HEPES-buffered saline, and resuspended in HEPES-buffered saline. Cells were electroporated with 20 μg/ml of scrambled control or bovine-specific DUSP1 siRNA (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) in the Bio-Rad Gene Pulser X-Cell system using a modified, preset HeLa protocol (170 V for 7.0 ms). Cells were seeded onto 0.2% porcine gelatin-coated glass coverslips in a 6-well culture dish with Cell Systems BAOEC medium for immunofluorescence staining and quantitative microscopy of pJNK, pp38, DUSP1, and actin stress fibers at 12–24 h post-electroporation. RAOECs were prepared for knockdown as above for DUSP1 siRNA treatment. Cells were transfected using 20 μg/ml of shRNA designed for rat TMEM184A in the pGFP-V-RS plasmid or control shRNA in the same plasmid (Origene, Rockville, MD) using the Bio-Rad Gene Pulser X-Cell system. Cells were seeded and processed as above for the DUSP1 knockdown system. Experimental treatments were accomplished 72 h after electroporation. Imaging of nuclear staining in TMEM184A knockdown cells was accomplished using a Nikon Eclipse TE 2000-U fluorescence microscope. Stress fibers in TMEM184A knockdown cells were visualized as above. To quantify pJNK, pp38, pcJun, and DUSP1, National Institutes of Health ImageJ software was used to determine the mean nuclear fluorescence intensity of at least 75 cells/treatment from each of at least three independent experiments. The nucleus of each cell was outlined accurately with the Oval tool by using the differential interference contrast images taken for each slide on the laser-scanning confocal or Nikon Eclipse microscope, and the nuclear fluorescence intensity for each cell was recorded. The nuclear fluorescence intensity measurements were corrected against minimal background fluorescence for each slide, and untreated controls were set to 100 to standardize between experiments. The averaged nuclear fluorescence intensity for each treatment was compared with untreated samples. To quantitate pMK2 and pHSP27, ImageJ software was used to determine the mean whole-cell fluorescence intensity of at least 75 cells/treatment/experiment and at least three independent experiments. The outline of each cell was determined and outlined with the Freehand Selections tool by referencing the differential interference contrast images, and the whole-cell fluorescence intensity for each cell was recorded. All measurements were corrected against minimal background fluorescence for each slide. The whole-cell fluorescence intensity was averaged for each treatment, and untreated control values were set to 100. ImageJ software was used to quantitate stress fibers in at least 100 cells/treatment/experiment from at least three independent experiments. The Threshold tool was used to eliminate background fluorescence. Perpendicular line profiling through the cytoplasm of individual cells was used to generate average fluorescence intensity profiles at regular intervals along the freehand line selection, where the y axis represented the level of fluorescence and the x axis represented the distance across each cell. Sharp, distinct peaks above the threshold were counted for each profile and averaged. Cortical actin peaks were excluded from the counts because their dynamics responded differently than the fibers that spanned the cells. All experiments are representative of at least three independent trials. Graphical data are shown as mean ± S.E. Comparisons between groups were analyzed using analysis of variance followed by a Tukey post hoc test. Comparisons between two groups were analyzed using a Student's t test. Differences with p < 0.05 were considered significant (†, p < 0.05; *, p < 0.01; ** p < 0.001). To test the hypothesis that unfractionated heparin alters p38 activation in ECs, whole-cell p38 activity was first evaluated in TNFα- treated BAOECs with or without heparin pretreatment. TNFα treatment (25 ng/ml) resulted in increased p38 activation, measured as pp38 by Western blotting. In cells pretreated with heparin, the level of pp38 was consistently lower than in TNFα-treated cells without heparin (Fig. 1A). There was little decrease in pp38 at low heparin concentrations. In fact, as shown in Fig. 1A, it sometimes appeared that, at low concentrations of heparin, there was a slight increase in whole-cell pp38. However, by 50 μg/ml heparin, it always appeared that there was less pp38 than in cells treated with TNFα alone. Neither heparin nor TNFα affected the levels of total p38. Activated p38 typically moves to the nucleus, where it phosphorylates numerous substrates (reviewed in Ref. 29Cuadrado A. Nebreda A. Mechanisms and functions of p38 MAPK signalling.Biochem. J. 2010; 429: 403-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (1120) Google Scholar). In the nucleus, pp38 can be inactivated by DUSP1 (reviewed in Ref. 30Bermudez O. Pagès G. Gimond C. The dual-specificity MAP kinase phosphatases: critical roles in development and cancer.Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2010; 299: C189-C202Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Therefore, it was important to understand whether there were heparin-induced changes in nuclear pp38. Quantitative analysis of nuclear pp38 using immunofluorescence was determined for a total of more than 200 cells at each time point from at least three experiments per condition. TNFα alone resulted in increased active p38 in the nucleus. Heparin treatment for 20 min without TNFα caused no change in pp38 levels (Fig. 1B). Heparin pretreatment decreased the TNFα-induced nuclear pp38 levels over at least 2 h (Fig. 1B). Longer incubations with heparin also resulted in no change in active p38. There were no changes in nuclear total p38 (data not shown). To be certain that the levels of active p38 in human ECs were also sensitive to heparin treatment, we evaluated nuclear pp38 in HBMECs (Fig. 1C). As with the BAOECs, TNFα treatment resulted in significant activation of p38, and heparin pretreatment caused a significant decrease in pp38 relative to TNFα treatment alone. To investigate the idea that heparin effects on ECs were mediated through a heparin receptor similar to heparin effects in VSMCs, HRmAbs effects on TNFα-induced responses in ECs were investigated. HRmAbs were able to mimic heparin in BAOECs, resulting in decreased pp38 compared with TNFα treatment without heparin or HRmAbs (Fig. 1D). Together, these data indicated that heparin treatment caused a decrease of pp38 in the nucleus and that this response depended on the heparin receptor to which the HRmAbs bind. To evaluate whether the decreases in activated p38 would also be observed with JNK, BAOECs were treated as for the p38 studies above"

Given the fact that the main components of the Hedgehog signaling pathway are expressed predominantly in the syncytial layer of human placental villi, in this study, we investigated the potential roles and underlying mechanisms of Hedgehog signaling in trophoblastic fusion. Activation of Hedgehog signaling by a variety of approaches robustly induced cell fusion and the expression of syncytial markers, whereas suppression of Hedgehog signaling significantly attenuated cell fusion and the expression of syncytial markers in both human primary cytotrophoblasts and trophoblast-like BeWo cells. Moreover, among glioma-associated oncogene (GLI) family transcriptional factors in Hedgehog signaling, knockdown of GLI2 but not GLI1 and GLI3 significantly attenuated Hedgehog-induced cell fusion, whereas overexpression of the GLI2 activator alone was sufficient to induce cell fusion. Finally, GLI2 not only stabilized glial cell missing-a, a pivotal transcriptional factor for trophoblastic syncytialization, but also formed a transcriptional heterodimer with glial cell missing-a to transactivate syncytin-1, a trophoblastic fusogen, and promote trophoblastic syncytialization.

Cell-cell fusion is essential for the development of a new organism (sexual fusion) or generation of diverse giant multinucleate cells that comprise distinct organs (nonsexual cell fusion). Fused cells undergo dramatic changes in biological behavior and acquire new developmental fates (1Aguilar P.S. Baylies M.K. Fleissner A. Helming L. Inoue N. Podbilewicz B. Wang H. Wong M.

Biol. 2008; 475: 135-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In human placental villi, secondary STBs, characterized by a single, multinucleated, and highly dynamic syncytium, are maintained by continuous fusion of underlying cytotrophoblasts (CTBs), which begins 1–2 weeks after implantation and lasts until delivery (5Gauster M. Huppertz B. The paradox of caspase 8 in human villous trophoblast fusion.Placenta. 2010; 31: 82-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar).

Biol. 2011; 713: 81-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). In placental villi, STBs directly in contact with maternal blood play a pivotal role in the maintenance of placental functions, including immune tolerance, controlling fetomaternal exchanges of nutrients and waste products, and producing and secreting pregnancy-associated hormones such as human chorionic gonadotropin β (βhCG), estradiol, and progesterone (7Morrish D.W.

Hormones, growth factors, cytokines, protein kinases, and transcriptional factors regulate the complex physiology of syncytialization (8Al-Nasiry S. Spitz B. Hanssens M. Luyten C. Pijnenborg R.

In the absence of HH, PTCH1 represses SMO activity and, thereby, GLI3 undergoes proteolytical cleavage into its repressor within the primary cilium, resulting in inactivation of HH signaling (17Lee J. Platt K.A. Censullo P. Ruiz i Altaba A. Gli1 is a target of Sonic hedgehog that induces ventral neural tube development.Development. 1997; 124: 2537-2552Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our previous studies have shown that the main components of the HH signaling pathway are expressed robustly in both human and murine placentas (18Pan Y.B. Gong Y. Ruan H.F. Pan L.Y. Wu X.K. Tang C.

In human placental villi, Desert hedgehog and Indian hedgehog are expressed predominantly in the villous core and trophoblast layers, respectively, whereas SHH is expressed in both trophoblast layers and villous cores. PTCH1 and SMO are expressed robustly in the STB layers, whereas GLI2 and GLI3, in contrast to GLI1, which is barely detectable, are distributed abundantly in both STB and CTB layers (19Tang C. Pan Y. Luo H. Xiong W. Zhu H. Ruan H. Wang J. Zou C. Tang L. Iguchi T. Long F. Wu X. Hedgehog signaling stimulates the conversion of cholesterol to steroids.Cell.

Acta. 2015; 1850: 1438-1448Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In addition, we have indicated that HH signaling is required for the synthesis of human placental hormones, including estradiol and progesterone (20Tang C. Mei L. Pan L. Xiong W. Zhu H. Ruan H. Zou C. Tang L. Iguchi T. Wu X. Hedgehog signaling through GLI1 and GLI2 is required for epithelial-mesenchymal transition in human trophoblasts.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2015; 1850: 1438-1448Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Given the fact that syncytialization is a prerequisite for the production of placental hormones, we hypothesize that HH signaling could have some implication in the cell-cell fusion of trophoblasts. In this study, we demonstrated that GLI2 activated by HH induces the syncytialization of human placental trophoblasts through formation of a transcriptional complex with GCMa. All cell lines used in this study were obtained from the ATCC. The human trophoblast-like BeWo cells were maintained in Ham's F-12K (Kaighn's) medium (Gibco BRL)/DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS (Life Technologies), 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 mg/ml streptomycin as described previously (19Tang C.

Human placentas were obtained from uncomplicated normal term (38- to 40-week) pregnancies after elective cesarean section without labor, following a protocol approved by the Ethics Committee of the School of Medicine of Zhejiang University. Primary CTBs were purified using a 5–65% Percoll (Sigma) gradient and cultured in DMEM containing 10% newborn calf serum (Life Technologies) as described previously (19Tang C. Pan Y. Luo H. Xiong W.

Total RNA was isolated from BeWo cells and CTBs using TRIzol reagent (Takara Biotechnology, Dalian, China) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. 5 μg of total RNA in a volume of 20 μl was reverse-transcribed using SuperScript III reagent (Life Technologies) and an oligo(deoxythymidine) primer with incubation at 42 °C for 1 h. After the termination of cDNA synthesis, the mRNA levels of target genes were determined by quantitative RT-PCR as described previously (19Tang C. Pan Y. Luo H. Xiong W. Zhu H. Ruan H. Wang J. Zou C.

Acta. 2015; 1850: 1438-1448Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The relative amounts of the mRNA levels of the target genes were normalized to β-actin, GAPDH, or α-tubulin levels, and the relative difference in mRNA levels was calculated by the 2−ΔΔCt method. Western blotting and immunoprecipitation were performed as described previously (19Tang C. Pan Y. Luo H. Xiong W. Zhu H. Ruan H. Wang J. Zou C. Tang L. Iguchi T. Long F. Wu X. Hedgehog signaling stimulates the conversion of cholesterol to steroids.Cell. Signal. 2015; 27: 487-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). For Western blotting, total protein extracts were prepared, and protein concentrations were determined by using a standard Bradford assay. 50 μg of total protein was subjected to SDS-PAGE, followed by a transfer onto PVDF membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA). The membranes were incubated with primary antibodies against ZO-1 (catalog no. sc-10804, Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), GLI1 (catalog no. sc-20687, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), GLI2 (catalog no. ab26056, Abcam Ltd., Cambridge, UK), GLI3 (catalog no. ab69838, Abcam), FLAG (catalog no. 14793, Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA), His (catalog no. sc-803, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), GCMa (catalog no. sc-101173, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), Syncytin 1 (catalog no. sc-50369, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), PP13 (catalog no. sc-131938, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and β-actin (catalog no. sc-69879, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), followed by incubation in secondary antibodies. For immunoprecipitation, cells were prepared in whole cell lysis buffer, and the lysates were immunoprecipitated with various antibodies followed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. Immunosignals were developed by using an enhanced chemiluminescence system. National Institutes of Health Image ImageJ (http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/) was used to quantify the immunoreactive bands, and the normalized antigen signals were calculated from target protein-derived and β-actin-derived signals. βhCG levels in serum-free culture supernatants of BeWo cells and CTBs were determined by Enzyme Immunometric Assay kit as described previously (21Cocquebert M. Berndt S. Segond N. Guibourdenche J. Murthi P. Aldaz-Carroll L. Evain-Brion D. Fournier T. Comparative expression of hCG β-genes in human trophoblast from early and late first-trimester placentas.Am. J. Physiol. Endocrinol. Metab. 2012; 303: E950-E958Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Immunofluorescence was performed on chamber slides (Nalge Nunc International, Naperville, IL). After rinsing in PBS, BeWo cells or CTBs were fixed in ice-cold methanol and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS (PBST). After incubation with blocking buffer for 30 min, cells were incubated with primary antibody against ZO-1 (catalog no. sc-10804, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), FLAG (catalog no. 14793, Cell Signaling Technology) or His (catalog no. sc-803, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) overnight at 4 °C. After washing with PBST, cells were incubated further with Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated secondary antibody (Life Technology). The nuclei were counterstained with DAPI, and immunostaining was analyzed using a laser-scanning microscope. To quantify syncytialization in BeWo cells and CTBs without bias, we performed a syncytium formation analysis as described previously (22Pidoux G. Gerbaud P. Gnidehou S. Grynberg M. Geneau G. Guibourdenche J. Carette D. Cronier L. Evain-Brion D. Malassiné A. Frendo J.L. ZO-1 is involved in trophoblastic cell differentiation in human placenta.Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2010; 298: C1517-C1526Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Briefly, three different non-overlapping fields were selected randomly for each time point under the microscope. The fusion index was calculated using the format of (N − S) / T, where N is the number of nuclei in the syncytia, S is the number of syncytia, and T is the total number of nuclei. The generation of lentiviruses expressing shRNA has been described previously (19Tang C. Pan Y. Luo H. Xiong W. Zhu H. Ruan H. Wang J. Zou C. Tang L. Iguchi T. Long F. Wu X. Hedgehog signaling stimulates the conversion of cholesterol to steroids.Cell. Signal. 2015; 27: 487-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The hairpin shRNA templates of complementary oligonucleotide-containing overhangs were digested and inserted into XbaI and NotI sites of a lentiviral shRNA expression vector, Pll3.7. The sequences of oligonucleotides have been described previously (19Tang C. Pan Y. Luo H. Xiong W. Zhu H. Ruan H. Wang J. Zou C. Tang L. Iguchi T. Long F. Wu X. Hedgehog signaling stimulates the conversion of cholesterol to steroids.Cell. Signal. 2015; 27: 487-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). 293FT packaging cells were transfected with each construct by Lipofectamine 2000 reagent, lentivirus-containing supernatants were harvested, and viruses with titers of more than 1 × 106 cfu/ml were used for infection in BeWo cells and CTBs in the presence of 8 μg/ml Polybrene (Sigma). CTBs were treated with cycloheximide up to the indicated time with or without pretreatment with recombinant SHH protein (SHH-N) for 24 h. At the indicated time, cells were lysed, and cell lysates were prepared for immunoblotting assays as described above. An in situ proximity ligation assay was performed according to the instructions of the manufacturer (Olink Bioscience, Uppsala, Sweden) (23Leuchowius K.J. Weibrecht I. Soderberg O. In situ proximity ligation assay for microscopy and flow cytometry.Curr. Protoc. Cytom. 2011; (Chapter 9, Unit 9 36)Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Briefly, CTBs were stained with anti-GLI2 rabbit purified polyclonal antibody at 1:200 and anti-GCMa mouse monoclonal antibody at 1:100. Signals were detected using a Duolink® 100 detection kit 613 (red), and nuclei were counterstained with DAPI (blue). Each red dot represents the protein-protein interaction complex. The images were analyzed using an optimized freeware (BlobFinder) obtained from the Centre for Image Analysis at Uppsala University. Complex human syncytin-1 (ERVWE1) promoter regions were amplified from the genomic DNA of BeWo cells by using specific primers. The PCR products were cloned into the pGL3-Basic vector (Promega, Madison, WI) to generate the luciferase reporter constructs of syncytin-1. All of these constructs were verified by a DNA sequencer. Transient transfection was performed using Lipofectamine 2000 according to the instructions of the manufacturer. After the cells were harvested, the cellular lysates were prepared and used for a Dual-Luciferase assay according to the instructions of the manufacturer (Promega). Firefly luciferase levels were normalized to Renilla luciferase levels. ChIP was performed as described previously using a commercial kit (catalog no. 17-295, Millipore, Billerica, MA) (19Tang C. Pan Y. Luo H. Xiong W. Zhu H. Ruan H. Wang J. Zou C. Tang L. Iguchi T. Long F. Wu X. Hedgehog signaling stimulates the conversion of cholesterol to steroids.Cell. Signal. 2015; 27: 487-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were fixed with 1% formaldehyde to cross-link transcription factors into chromatin DNA and resuspended with lysis buffer supplemented with protease inhibitor mixture. Then, cells were sonicated to shear chromatin DNA to lengths between 200 and 1000 basepairs. Immunoprecipitation was performed with GLI2 and GCMa antibodies or control IgG. After incubation with protein A-agarose/salmon sperm DNA, the antibody-protein-DNA-agarose complex was washed and harvested for subsequent reverse cross-linking. The sheared DNA fragments from reverse cross-linking were extracted for further PCR amplification using the specific primers. All numerous data are expressed as mean ± S.D. and analyzed by one-way analysis of variance and Tukey-Kramer multiple comparison tests (SPSS 13.0J software, SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL). Statistical significance was assessed at p < 0.05 and p < 0.01. Experiments were performed independently in triplicate, and the results were qualitatively identical. Representative experiments are shown. Human primary CTBs and trophoblast-like BeWo cells capable of mimicking the biological behavior of placental villous trophoblasts are valuable models for the study of syncytialization (24Drewlo S. Baczyk D. Dunk C. Kingdom J. Fusion assays and models for the trophoblast.Methods Mol. Biol. 2008; 475: 363-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). To investigate the effects of HH on syncytialization, we treated CTBs with recombinant human SHH protein ranging from 0–100 ng/ml or SM and performed immunofluorescent staining and Western blotting for ZO-1 to define the intercellular contact between aggregated cells and quantify the protein levels, respectively. SHH-N dose-dependently induced the cell-cell fusion of CTBs, and SHH-N at 50 and 100 ng/ml increased the fusion index 1.9- and 3.0-fold, respectively (Fig. 1, A and C). Consistently, SM treatment for 24 and 48 h led to decreases in ZO-1 protein levels by 50% and 67%, respectively, compared with CM treatment (Fig. 1B). To confirm the universality of SHH in inducing syncytialization, we treated trophoblast-like BeWo cells with either CM or SM for 24 and 48 h. Immunofluorescent staining for ZO-1 demonstrated that SM similarly stimulated the formation of large syncytia in BeWo cells and increased the fusion index ∼2.5- and 3.7-fold, respectively (Fig. 1, D and E). Likewise, SM treatment decreased ZO-1 protein levels by 70% and 78% at 24 and 48 h, respectively, over the CM treatment (Fig. 1F). However, pretreatment with 5E1 SHH-neutralizing antibody almost completely abolished not only the SM-induced protein levels of GLI1, a target of the HH pathway, but also the SM-negated protein levels of ZO-1 (Fig. 1G). Finally, to investigate the expression of syncytialization markers, including βhCG, syncytin-1, and placental protein 13 (PP13) (25Butler T.M. Elustondo P.A. Hannigan G.E. MacPhee D.J. Integrin-linked kinase can facilitate syncytialization and hormonal differentiation of the human trophoblast-derived BeWo cell line.Reprod. Biol. Endocrinol. 2009; 7: 51Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), we performed Enzyme Immunometric Assay (EIA), quantitative RT-PCR, and Western blotting assays. In CTBs, SM treatment for 24 and 48 h increased syncytin-1 protein levels 1.5- and 2.3-fold and increased PP13 protein levels 1.2- and 1.9-fold, respectively (Fig. 1H). In both CTBs and BeWo cells, treatment with SM for 48 h resulted in 0.6- and 1.8-fold increases in βhCG levels, respectively, compared with CM treatment (Fig. 1I). Similarly, SM treatment for 24 and 48 h increased syncytin-1 mRNA levels 2.7- and 3.0-fold in BeWo cells and 2.5- and 3.0-fold in CTBs, respectively. However, SM treatment for 24 and 48 h increased PP13 mRNA levels up to 1.8- and 2.0-fold in BeWo cells and up to 2.0- and 3.6-fold in CTBs, respectively (Fig. 1J). Because syncytin-2 has been regarded to play an important role in trophoblast fusion, we also detected syncytin-2 mRNA levels and found that, similar to syncytin-1, syncytin-2 mRNA levels were up-regulated by either SHH-N or SM stimulation in both CTBs and BeWo cells (data not shown). Taken together, HH induces syncytialization not only in human primary CTBs but also in human trophoblast-like BeWo cells. To determine whether HH-induced syncytialization is SMO-dependent, we activated HH signaling by either treatment with a SMO agonist, purmorphamine (Pur), or overexpression of a constitutively active form of SMO (SMO*) and suppressed HH signaling by a SMO inhibitor, cyclopamine (Cyc). Immunofluorescent staining indicated that treatment with purmorphamine led to the apparent disappearance of ZO-1 at intercellular contact and appearance of a larger number of multinuclear cells than vehicle treatment (Fig. 2A). Purmorphamine at 1 and 2 μm increased the fusion index 1.4- and 3.2-fold, respectively (Fig. 2B), and increased βhCG production up to 1.5- and 2.0-fold, respectively (Fig. 2E). Moreover, activation of SMO by purmorphamine decreased ZO-1 mRNA and protein levels and increased GLI1 protein levels and syncytialization marker mRNA and protein levels in dose-dependent manners. Purmorphamine at 2 μm negated ZO-1 mRNA and protein levels by 0.6- and 0.8-fold, respectively, whereas it induced the protein levels of GLI1 by 2.4-fold, the mRNA levels of syncytin-1 and PP13 by 2.8- and 1.5-fold, respectively, and it induced the protein levels of syncytin-1 and PP13 by 2.8- and 2.0-fold, respectively (Fig. 2, C and D). Likewise, overexpression of SMO* decreased the mRNA levels of ZO-1 0.7-fold and increased the mRNA levels of syncytin-1 and PP13 2.2- and 1.9-fold, respectively, and increased the protein levels of syncytin-1 and PP13 1.8- and 1.5-fold, respectively, and βhCG production 1.2-fold (Fig. 2, F–H). Conversely, pretreatment of cells with cyclopamine significantly reversed the effects caused by SM. Immunofluorescent staining showed that cyclopamine significantly increased ZO-1 protein levels at intercellular contact and dose-dependently attenuated SM-induced decreases in the fusion index (Fig. 2, I and J). Moreover, cyclopamine dose-dependently reversed not only SM-negated mRNA and protein levels of ZO-1 but also SM-induced mRNA and protein levels of syncytin-1 and PP13 and protein levels of GLI1 (Fig. 2L). Cyclopamine at 5 μm decreased the SM-induced fusion index by 52%, mRNA levels of syncytin-1 and PP13 by 63% and 50%, protein levels of syncytin-1 and PP13 by 69% and 63%, GLI1 protein levels by 60%, and βhCG production by 49%, whereas it increased SM-negated ZO-1 mRNA and protein levels 1.7- and 0.6-fold, respectively (Fig. 2, K and L). Therefore, HH-induced trophoblastic syncytialization is SMO-dependent, and activation of SMO alone is sufficient to induce trophoblastic syncytialization. To assess the potential involvement of GLI transcriptional factors in HH-induced syncytialization, we generated lentiviruses expressing GLI1, GLI2, or GLI3 shRNA that knocked down the expression of GLI1, GLI2, and GLI3 by as much as 60–70% (Fig. 3, A–C). Immunofluorescence showed that knockdown of GLI2, but not GLI1 and GLI3, apparently reversed the SM-induced disappearance of ZO-1 staining between the mononucleated trophoblast cell membranes and the appearance"

Retinal images were rated and the following measures compared between cases and controls: retinal vessel calibre, arterio-venous ratio, retinal fractal dimension, and simple and curvature retinal vessel tortuosity.Total and venular (but not arteriolar) simple retinal vessel tortuosity levels were significantly higher in cases than controls (t = 2.45, p = 0.015; t = 2.53, p = 0.013 respectively). The associations persisted after adjustment for demographic factors, retinopathy, neuropathy, obesity and blood pressure. There were no other significant differences between cases and controls in retinal measures.A novel association was found between higher venular tortuosity and cognitive impairment in newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes mellitus. This might be accounted for by factors such as hypoxia, thrombus formation, increased vasoendothelial growth factor release and inflammation affecting both the visible retinal and the unobserved cerebral microvasculature."

https://openalex.org/W2243337775,"Limiting the impact of wildlife damage in a cost effective manner requires an understanding of how control inputs change the occurrence of damage through their effect on animal density. Despite this, there are few studies linking wildlife management (control), with changes in animal abundance and prevailing levels of wildlife damage. We use the impact and management of wild pigs as a case study to demonstrate this linkage. Ground disturbance by wild pigs has become a conservation issue of global concern because of its potential effects on successional changes in vegetation structure and composition, habitat for other species, and functional soil properties. In this study, we used a 3-year pig control programme (ground hunting) undertaken in a temperate rainforest area of northern New Zealand to evaluate effects on pig abundance, and patterns and rates of ground disturbance and ground disturbance recovery and the cost effectiveness of differing control strategies. Control reduced pig densities by over a third of the estimated carrying capacity, but more than halved average prevailing ground disturbance. Rates of new ground disturbance accelerated with increasing pig density, while rates of ground disturbance recovery were not related to prevailing pig density. Stochastic simulation models based on the measured relationships between control, pig density and rate of ground disturbance and recovery indicated that control could reduce ground disturbance substantially. However, the rate at which prevailing ground disturbance was reduced diminished rapidly as more intense, and hence expensive, pig control regimes were simulated. The model produced in this study provides a framework that links conservation of indigenous ecological communities to control inputs through the reduction of wildlife damage and suggests that managers should consider carefully the marginal cost of higher investment in wildlife damage control, relative to its marginal conservation return."
https://openalex.org/W2332209807,"Sustained activation of PKCα is required for long term physiological responses, such as growth arrest and differentiation. However, studies with pharmacological agonists (e.g. phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA)) indicate that prolonged stimulation leads to PKCα desensitization via dephosphorylation and/or degradation. The current study analyzed effects of chronic stimulation with the physiological agonist diacylglycerol. Repeated addition of 1,2-dioctanoyl-sn-glycerol (DiC8) resulted in sustained plasma membrane association of PKCα in a pattern comparable with that induced by PMA. However, although PMA potently down-regulated PKCα, prolonged activation by DiC8 failed to engage known desensitization mechanisms, with the enzyme remaining membrane-associated and able to support sustained downstream signaling. DiC8-activated PKCα did not undergo dephosphorylation, ubiquitination, or internalization, early events in PKCα desensitization. Although DiC8 efficiently down-regulated novel PKCs PKCδ and PKCϵ, differences in Ca(2+) sensitivity and diacylglycerol affinity were excluded as mediators of the selective resistance of PKCα. Roles for Hsp/Hsc70 and Hsp90 were also excluded. PMA, but not DiC8, targeted PKCα to detergent-resistant membranes, and disruption of these domains with cholesterol-binding agents demonstrated a role for differential membrane compartmentalization in selective agonist-induced degradation. Chronic DiC8 treatment failed to desensitize PKCα in several cell types and did not affect PKCβI; thus, conventional PKCs appear generally insensitive to desensitization by sustained diacylglycerol stimulation. Consistent with this conclusion, prolonged (several-day) membrane association/activation of PKCα is seen in self-renewing epithelium of the intestine, cervix, and skin. PKCα deficiency affects gene expression, differentiation, and tumorigenesis in these tissues, highlighting the importance of mechanisms that protect PKCα from desensitization in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2409480635,"Beta (β)-human chorionic gonadotropin (β-HCG) is used to confirm the diagnosis and plan treatment of intracranial germinomas. However, the cutoff values of serum β-HCG in diagnosis of intracranial germinomas reported in the literature are inconsistent. To establish an appropriate cutoff value of serum β-HCG for diagnosis of intracranial germinomas, we retrospectively reviewed the records of intracranial tumor patients who received serum β-HCG and α-fetoprotein (AFP) tests for diagnostic purposes at our hospital from 2005 to 2014.A total of 93 intracranial germinomas and 289 intracranial non-germ cell tumors were included in this study. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was used to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of 3 cutoffs (0.1, 0.4, and 0.5 mIU/mL) for diagnosing intracranial germinomas. The serum β-HCG level of intracranial germinoma patients was further analyzed to investigate the effect of metastasis status and tumor location on serum β-HCG level.The area under the ROC curve was 0.81 (P < .001), suggesting β-HCG is an effective marker. Of the 3 cutoff values, 0.1 mIU/mL possessed a highest sensitivity (66.67%) and good specificity (91%). Although there was no β-HCG level difference between metastatic and non-metastatic intracranial germinoma patients, the diagnostic rate of metastatic neurohypophyseal germinomas was significantly higher than that of its non-metastatic counterpart (P < .05), implying that the location of the germinoma might need to be considered when β-HCG is used as a marker to predict metastasis.Determining an optimal cutoff of serum β-HCG is helpful for assisting the diagnosis of intracranial germinoma."
https://openalex.org/W2243567911,"Objectives There is an urgent need to develop a safe, effective, orally active, and inexpensive therapy for African trypanosomiasis due to the drawbacks of current drugs. Selective tubulin inhibitors have the potential to be promising drug candidates for the treatment of this disease, which is based on the tubulin protein structural difference between mammalian and trypanosome cells. We propose to identify novel tubulin inhibitors from a compound library developed based on the lead compounds that selectively target trypanosomiasis. Methods We used Trypanosoma brucei brucei as the parasite model, and human normal kidney cells and mouse microphage cells as the host model. Growth rates of both trypanosomes and mammalian cells were determined as a means to screen compounds that selectively inhibit the proliferation of parasites. Furthermore, we examined the cell cycle profile of the parasite and compared tubulin polymerization dynamics before and after the treatment using identified compounds. Last, in vivo anti-parasite activities of these compounds were determined in T. brucei-infected mice. Results Three compounds were selected that are 100 fold more effective against the growth of T. brucei cells than mammalian cells. These compounds caused cell cycle progression defects in T. brucei cells. Western analyses indicated that these compounds decreased tubulin polymerization in T. brucei cells. The in vivo investigation revealed that these compounds, when admitted orally, inhibited T. brucei cell proliferation in mouse blood. However, they were not potent enough to clear up the infection completely. Conclusions These compounds are promising lead compounds as orally active agents for drug development of anti-trypanosome agents. A more detail structure activity relationship (SAR) was summarized that will be used to guide future lead optimization to improve the selectivity and potency of the current compounds."
https://openalex.org/W2244481220,"Despite a plethora of literature has documented that osteoarthritis (OA) is veritably associated with oxidative stress-mediated chondrocyte death and matrix degradation, yet the possible involvement of synoviocyte abnormality as causative factor of OA has not been thoroughly investigated. For this reason, we conduct the current studies to insight into how synoviocytes could respond to an episode of folate-deprived (FD) condition. First, when HIG-82 synoviocytes were cultivated under FD condition, a time-dependent growth impediment was observed and the demise of these cells was demonstrated to be apoptotic in nature mediated through FD-evoked overproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and drastically released of cytosolic calcium (Ca2+) concentrations. Next, we uncovered that FD-evoked ROS overproduction could only be strongly suppressed by either mitochondrial complex II inhibitors (TTFA and carboxin) or NADPH oxidase (NOX) inhibitors (AEBSF and apocynin), but not by mitochondrial complex I inhibitor (rotenone) and mitochondrial complex III inhibitor (antimycin A). Interestingly, this selective inhibition of FD-evoked ROS by mitochondrial complex II and NOX inhibitors was found to correlate excellently with the suppression of cytosolic Ca2+ release and reduced the magnitude of the apoptotic TUNEL-positive cells. Taken together, we present the first evidence here that FD-triggered ROS overproduction in synoviocytes is originated from mitochondrial complex II and NOX. Both elevated ROS in tandem with cytosolic Ca2+ overload serve as final arbitrators for apoptotic lethality of synoviocytes cultivated under FD condition. Thus, folate supplementation may be beneficial to patients with OA."

Herein, we have used an immune-informatic approach for the identification, among Leishmania major potentially excreted/secreted proteins previously described, those generating peptides that could be targeted by the cytotoxic immune response. Seventy-eight nonameric peptides that are predicted to be loaded by HLA-A*0201 molecule were generated and their binding capacity to HLA-A2 was evaluated. These peptides were grouped into 20 pools and their immunogenicity was evaluated by in vitro stimulation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells from HLA-A2+-immune individuals with a history of zoonotic cutaneous leishmaniasis. Six peptides were identified according to their ability to elicit production of granzyme B. Furthermore, among these peptides 3 showed highest affinity to HLA-A*0201, one derived from an elongation factor 1-alpha and two from an unknown protein. These proteins could constitute potential vaccine candidates against leishmaniasis."

The apparent anodic curve was selected from the measured anodic curves. The imaginary cathodic line was obtained by linearly fitting the differences of anodic curves and can be moved evenly or rotated to predict the number and value of corrosion potentials."
https://openalex.org/W2233778785,"Microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP) is essential for the assembly of triglyceride-rich apolipoprotein B-containing lipoproteins. Previous studies in our laboratory identified a novel splice variant of MTP in mice that we named MTP-B. MTP-B has a unique first exon (1B) located 2.7 kB upstream of the first exon (1A) for canonical MTP (MTP-A). The two mature isoforms, though nearly identical in sequence and function, have different tissue expression patterns. In this study we report the identification of a second MTP splice variant (MTP-C), which contains both exons 1B and 1A. MTP-C is expressed in all the tissues we tested. In cells transfected with MTP-C, protein expression was less than 15% of that found when the cells were transfected with MTP-A or MTP-B. In silico analysis of the 5’-UTR of MTP-C revealed seven ATGs upstream of the start site for MTP-A, which is the only viable start site in frame with the main coding sequence. One of those ATGs was located in the 5’-UTR for MTP-A. We generated reporter constructs in which the 5’-UTRs of MTP-A or MTP-C were inserted between an SV40 promoter and the coding sequence of the luciferase gene and transfected these constructs into HEK 293 cells. Luciferase activity was significantly reduced by the MTP-C 5’-UTR, but not by the MTP-A 5’-UTR. We conclude that alternative splicing plays a key role in regulating MTP expression by introducing unique 5’-UTRs, which contain elements that alter translation efficiency, enabling the cell to optimize MTP levels and activity."
https://openalex.org/W2235203373,"Well-developed point-of-care (POC) cancer screening tools have the potential to provide better cancer care to patients in both developed and developing countries. However, new medical technology will not be adopted by medical providers unless it addresses a population's existing needs and end-users' preferences. The goals of our study were to assess primary care providers' level of awareness, interest, and preferences in using POC cancer screening technology in their practice and to provide guidelines to biomedical engineers for future POC technology development. A total of 350 primary care providers completed a one-time self-administered online survey, which took approximately 10 minutes to complete. A $50 Amazon gift card was given as an honorarium for the first 100 respondents to encourage participation. The description of POC cancer screening technology was provided in the beginning of the survey to ensure all participants had a basic understanding of what constitutes POC technology. More than half of the participants (57%) stated that they heard of the term ""POC technology"" for the first time when they took the survey. However, almost all of the participants (97%) stated they were either ""very interested"" (68%) or ""somewhat interested"" (29%) in using POC cancer screening technology in their practice. Demographic characteristics such as the length of being in the practice of medicine, the percentage of patients on Medicaid, and the average number of patients per day were not shown to be associated with the level of interest in using POC. These data show that there is a great interest in POC cancer screening technology utilization among this population of primary care providers and vast room for future investigations to further understand the interest and preferences in using POC cancer technology in practice. Ensuring that the benefits of new technology outweigh the costs will maximize the likelihood it will be used by medical providers and patients."
https://openalex.org/W2242445514,"Introduction The EOS stereoradiography system has shown to provide reliable varus/valgus (VV) measurements of the lower limb in 2D (VV2D) and 3D (VV3D) after total knee arthroplasty (TKA). Validity of these measurements has not been investigated yet, therefore the purpose of this study was to determine validity of EOS VV2D and VV3D. Methods EOS images were made of a lower limb phantom containing a knee prosthesis, while varying VV angle from 15° varus to 15° valgus and flexion angle from 0° to 20°, and changing rotation from 20° internal to 20° external rotation. Differences between the actual VV position of the lower limb phantom and its position as measured on EOS 2D and 3D images were investigated. Results Rotation, flexion or VV angle alone had no major impact on VV2D or VV3D. Combination of VV angle and rotation with full extension did not show major differences in VV2D measurements either. Combination of flexion and rotation with a neutral VV angle showed variation of up to 7.4° for VV2D; maximum variation for VV3D was only 1.5°. A combination of the three variables showed an even greater distortion of VV2D, while VV3D stayed relatively constant. Maximum measurement difference between preset VV angle and VV2D was 9.8°, while the difference with VV3D was only 1.9°. The largest differences between the preset VV angle and VV2D were found when installing the leg in extreme angles, for example 15° valgus, 20° flexion and 20° internal rotation. Conclusions After TKA, EOS VV3D were more valid than VV2D, indicating that 3D measurements compensate for malpositioning during acquisition. Caution is warranted when measuring VV angle on a conventional radiograph of a knee with a flexion contracture, varus or valgus angle and/or rotation of the knee joint during acquisition."
https://openalex.org/W2413881554,"Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) is an important pathogen that has a significant economic impact on the swine industry by imposing a high rate of mortality in suckling piglets. However, limited information on the productivity values of gilts and sows infected with PEDV is available. Here, we evaluate the productivity index in gilts and sows during the 1-year period before (19 January 2013 to 18 January 2014) and after (19 January 2014 to 18 January 2015) a PEDV outbreak from a 2000-sow breeding herd in Taiwan. The farrowing rate (FR), return rate (RR), total pigs born per litter (TB), pigs born alive per litter (BA), weaning pigs per litter (WPL), pre-weaning mortality, percentage of sows mated by 7 days after weaning, weaning to first service interval (WFSI), mated female nonproductive days (NPDs), replacement rate of sows and sow culling rate were compared using productive records. The FR (-9.6%), RR (+9.8%), TB (-1.6), BA (-1.1), WPL (-1.1), sows mated by 7 days after weaning (-6.9%), WFSI (+0.8 days), NPDs (+6.9 days) and sow culling rate (+7.2%) were significantly different between the 1-year pre-PEDV outbreak period and the post-PEDV outbreak period. Impacts of the PEDV infection on the reproductive performance were more severe in pregnant gilts than in sows. In conclusion, these findings indicate that the outbreak of PEDV caused an increase in the rate of NPDs in breeding herds."
https://openalex.org/W2472303455,"Genipin (GNP) effectively inhibits uncoupling protein 2 (UCP2), which regulates the leakage of protons across the inner mitochondrial membrane. UCP2 inhibition may induce pancreatic adenocarcinoma cell death by increasing reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels. In this study, the hydroxyls at positions C10 (10-OH) and C1 (1-OH) of GNP were hypothesized to be the active groups that cause these inhibitory effects. Four GNP derivatives in which the hydroxyl at position C10 or C1 was replaced with other chemical groups were synthesized and isolated. Differences in the inhibitory effects of GNP and its four derivatives on pancreatic carcinoma cell (Panc-1) proliferation were assessed. The effects of GNP and its derivatives on apoptosis, UCP2 inhibition and ROS production were also studied to explore the relationship between GNP’s activity and its structure. The derivatives with 1-OH substitutions, geniposide (1-GNP1) and 1-ethyl-genipin (1-GNP2) lacked cytotoxic effects, while the other derivatives that retained 1-OH, 10-piv-genipin (10-GNP1) and 10-acetic acid-genipin (10-GNP2) exerted biological effects similar to those of GNP, even in the absence of 10-OH. Thus, 1-OH is the key functional group in the structure of GNP that is responsible for GNP’s apoptotic effects. These cytotoxic effects involve the induction of Panc-1 cell apoptosis through UCP2 inhibition and subsequent ROS production."
https://openalex.org/W2236494402,"As volume of genomic data grows, computational methods become essential for providing a first glimpse onto gene annotations. Automated Gene Ontology (GO) annotation methods based on hierarchical ensemble classification techniques are particularly interesting when interpretability of annotation results is a main concern. In these methods, raw GO-term predictions computed by base binary classifiers are leveraged by checking the consistency of predefined GO relationships. Both formal leveraging strategies, with main focus on annotation precision, and heuristic alternatives, with main focus on scalability issues, have been described in literature. In this contribution, a factor graph approach to the hierarchical ensemble formulation of the automated GO annotation problem is presented. In this formal framework, a core factor graph is first built based on the GO structure and then enriched to take into account the noisy nature of GO-term predictions. Hence, starting from raw GO-term predictions, an iterative message passing algorithm between nodes of the factor graph is used to compute marginal probabilities of target GO-terms. Evaluations on Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Arabidopsis thaliana and Drosophila melanogaster protein sequences from the GO Molecular Function domain showed significant improvements over competing approaches, even when protein sequences were naively characterized by their physicochemical and secondary structure properties or when loose noisy annotation datasets were considered. Based on these promising results and using Arabidopsis thaliana annotation data, we extend our approach to the identification of most promising molecular function annotations for a set of proteins of unknown function in Solanum lycopersicum."
https://openalex.org/W2238535101,"Purpose Liver metastasis is a common phenomenon in breast cancer patients. Hepatic lesions detected in breast cancer patients may be easily misdiagnosed as metastatic sites, rather than being treated as primary foci. This descriptive study aims to investigate the clinicopathological characteristics of second primary hepatocellular carcinoma in breast cancer patients and to infer in which circumstances liver biopsy is needed. Methods Eighty-one consecutive breast cancer patients with hepatic lesions admitted to our department were retrospectively studied and analyzed from January 2009 to March 2014 according to Warren and Gates’ criteria for second primary cancers. Results Second primary hepatocellular carcinoma was observed in sixteen of seventy eight patients with breast cancer. There was a significant difference in HBV status between the second HCC group and liver metastases group (P<0.0001). There was no significant difference in age (P = 0.2254) and family history (P = 0.1160) between second primary HCC and metastases group. Two of these patients had synchronous second primary hepatocellular carcinoma and the remaining fourteen patients had metachronous second primary HCC. All sixteen patients were infected with hepatitis, including hepatitis virus B and C, or resolved HBV infection. Conclusions Breast cancer patients with either HBV infection or resolved HBV infection, regardless of an elevated AFP level, may receive liver biopsy to avoid unnecessary and inappropriate treatments for metastasis. Awareness of second primary HCC in breast cancer patients needs to be emphasized."
https://openalex.org/W2395338365,"Mitochondria are essential for the energy production of eukaryotic cells. During aging mitochondria run through various processes which change their quality in terms of activity, health and metabolic supply. In recent years, many of these processes such as fission and fusion of mitochondria, mitophagy, mitochondrial biogenesis and energy consumption have been subject of research. Based on numerous experimental insights, it was possible to qualify mitochondrial behaviour in computational simulations. Here, we present a new biophysical model based on the approach of Figge et al. in 2012. We introduce exponential decay and growth laws for each mitochondrial process to derive its time-dependent probability during the aging of cells. All mitochondrial processes of the original model are mathematically and biophysically redefined and additional processes are implemented: Mitochondrial fission and fusion is separated into a metabolic outer-membrane part and a protein-related inner-membrane part, a quality-dependent threshold for mitophagy and mitochondrial biogenesis is introduced and processes for activity-dependent internal oxidative stress as well as mitochondrial repair mechanisms are newly included. Our findings reveal a decrease of mitochondrial quality and a fragmentation of the mitochondrial network during aging. Additionally, the model discloses a quality increasing mechanism due to the interplay of the mitophagy and biogenesis cycle and the fission and fusion cycle of mitochondria. It is revealed that decreased mitochondrial repair can be a quality saving process in aged cells. Furthermore, the model finds strategies to sustain the quality of the mitochondrial network in cells with high production rates of reactive oxygen species due to large energy demands. Hence, the model adds new insights to biophysical mechanisms of mitochondrial aging and provides novel understandings of the interdependency of mitochondrial processes."
