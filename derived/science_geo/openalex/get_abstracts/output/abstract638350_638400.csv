https://openalex.org/W2899054965,"Lithium metal anodes offer high theoretical capacities (3,860 milliampere-hours per gram)1, but rechargeable batteries built with such anodes suffer from dendrite growth and low Coulombic efficiency (the ratio of charge output to charge input), preventing their commercial adoption2,3. The formation of inactive (‘dead’) lithium— which consists of both (electro)chemically formed Li+ compounds in the solid electrolyte interphase and electrically isolated unreacted metallic Li0 (refs 4,5)—causes capacity loss and safety hazards. Quantitatively distinguishing between Li+ in components of the solid electrolyte interphase and unreacted metallic Li0 has not been possible, owing to the lack of effective diagnostic tools. Optical microscopy6, in situ environmental transmission electron microscopy7,8, X-ray microtomography9 and magnetic resonance imaging10 provide a morphological perspective with little chemical information. Nuclear magnetic resonance11, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy12 and cryogenic transmission electron microscopy13,14 can distinguish between Li+ in the solid electrolyte interphase and metallic Li0, but their detection ranges are limited to surfaces or local regions. Here we establish the analytical method of titration gas chromatography to quantify the contribution of unreacted metallic Li0 to the total amount of inactive lithium. We identify the unreacted metallic Li0, not the (electro)chemically formed Li+ in the solid electrolyte interphase, as the dominant source of inactive lithium and capacity loss. By coupling the unreacted metallic Li0 content to observations of its local microstructure and nanostructure by cryogenic electron microscopy (both scanning and transmission), we also establish the formation mechanism of inactive lithium in different types of electrolytes and determine the underlying cause of low Coulombic efficiency in plating and stripping (the charge and discharge processes, respectively, in a full cell) of lithium metal anodes. We propose strategies for making lithium plating and stripping more efficient so that lithium metal anodes can be used for next-generation high-energy batteries. Titration gas chromatography is developed as an analytical method of distinguishing between lithium metal and lithium compounds within a cycled battery and assessing the amount of unreacted metallic lithium available."

https://openalex.org/W2969924554,"The ability to manipulate droplets on a substrate using electric signals1—known as digital microfluidics—is used in optical2,3, biomedical4,5, thermal6 and electronic7 applications and has led to commercially available liquid lenses8 and diagnostics kits9,10. Such electrical actuation is mainly achieved by electrowetting, with droplets attracted towards and spreading on a conductive substrate in response to an applied voltage. To ensure strong and practical actuation, the substrate is covered with a dielectric layer and a hydrophobic topcoat for electrowetting-on-dielectric (EWOD)11-13; this increases the actuation voltage (to about 100 volts) and can compromise reliability owing to dielectric breakdown14, electric charging15 and biofouling16. Here we demonstrate droplet manipulation that uses electrical signals to induce the liquid to dewet, rather than wet, a hydrophilic conductive substrate without the need for added layers. In this electrodewetting mechanism, which is phenomenologically opposite to electrowetting, the liquid–substrate interaction is not controlled directly by electric field but instead by field-induced attachment and detachment of ionic surfactants to the substrate. We show that this actuation mechanism can perform all the basic fluidic operations of digital microfluidics using water on doped silicon wafers in air, with only ±2.5 volts of driving voltage, a few microamperes of current and about 0.015 times the critical micelle concentration of an ionic surfactant. The system can also handle common buffers and organic solvents, promising a simple and reliable microfluidic platform for a broad range of applications. A method of droplet manipulation is described that uses electrical signals to induce the liquid to dewet, rather than wet, a hydrophilic conductive surface."
https://openalex.org/W2969545244,"Big web data from sources including online news and Twitter are good resources for investigating deep learning. However, collected news articles and tweets almost certainly contain data unnecessary for learning, and this disturbs accurate learning. This paper explores the performance of word2vec Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to classify news articles and tweets into related and unrelated ones. Using two word embedding algorithms of word2vec, Continuous Bag-of-Word (CBOW) and Skip-gram, we constructed CNN with the CBOW model and CNN with the Skip-gram model. We measured the classification accuracy of CNN with CBOW, CNN with Skip-gram, and CNN without word2vec models for real news articles and tweets. The experimental results indicated that word2vec significantly improved the accuracy of the classification model. The accuracy of the CBOW model was higher and more stable when compared to that of the Skip-gram model. The CBOW model exhibited better performance on news articles, and the Skip-gram model exhibited better performance on tweets. Specifically, CNN with word2vec models was more effective on news articles when compared to that on tweets because news articles are typically more uniform when compared to tweets."
https://openalex.org/W2969491951,"Clustering homologous sequences based on their similarity is a problem that appears in many bioinformatics applications. The fact that sequences cluster is ultimately the result of their phylogenetic relationships. Despite this observation and the natural ways in which a tree can define clusters, most applications of sequence clustering do not use a phylogenetic tree and instead operate on pairwise sequence distances. Due to advances in large-scale phylogenetic inference, we argue that tree-based clustering is under-utilized. We define a family of optimization problems that, given an arbitrary tree, return the minimum number of clusters such that all clusters adhere to constraints on their heterogeneity. We study three specific constraints, limiting (1) the diameter of each cluster, (2) the sum of its branch lengths, or (3) chains of pairwise distances. These three problems can be solved in time that increases linearly with the size of the tree, and for two of the three criteria, the algorithms have been known in the theoretical computer scientist literature. We implement these algorithms in a tool called TreeCluster, which we test on three applications: OTU clustering for microbiome data, HIV transmission clustering, and divide-and-conquer multiple sequence alignment. We show that, by using tree-based distances, TreeCluster generates more internally consistent clusters than alternatives and improves the effectiveness of downstream applications. TreeCluster is available at https://github.com/niemasd/TreeCluster."
https://openalex.org/W2969614424,"Epidemiological studies revealed that antibiotics exposure increases a risk of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) development. It remained largely unknown how antibiotic-induced dysbiosis confers the risk for enhanced inflammatory response. The aim of the present study was to test the hypothesis that SCFAs, their receptors and transporters mediate the antibiotic long-term effects on the functional state of colonic mucosa and susceptibility to the experimental colitis. Male Wistar rats were treated daily for 14 days with antibiotic ceftriaxone (300 mg/kg, i.m.) or vehicle; euthanized by CO2 inhalation followed by cervical dislocation in 1, 14 or 56 days after antibiotic withdrawal. We found increased cecum weight and sustained changes in microbiota composition after ceftriaxone treatment with increased number of conditionally pathogenic enterobacteria, E. coli, Clostridium, Staphylococcus spp. and hemolytic bacteria even at 56 days after antibiotic withdrawal. The concentration of SCFAs was decreased after ceftriaxone withdrawal. We found decreased immunoreactivity of the FFA2, FFA3 receptors, SMCT1 and increased MCT1 & MCT4 transporters of SCFAs in colon mucosa. These changes evoked a significant shift in colonic mucosal homeostasis: the disturbance of oxidant-antioxidant balance; activation of redox-sensitive transcription factor HIF1α and ERK1/2 MAP kinase; increased colonic epithelial permeability and bacterial translocation to blood; morphological remodeling of the colonic tissue. Ceftriaxone pretreatment significantly reinforced inflammation during experimental colitis 56 days after ceftriaxone withdrawal, which was confirmed by increased histopathology of colitis, Goblet cell dysfunction, colonic dilatation and wall thickening, and increased serum levels of inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α and IL-10). Since the recognition of the importance of microbiota metabolic activity rather than their composition in the development of inflammatory disorders, e.g. IBD, the present study is the first report on the role of the SCFA system in the long lasting side effects of antibiotic treatment and its implication in IBD development."
https://openalex.org/W2969375801,"Objectives Maternal health care improvement and reduction of maternal and child mortality are priorities of the global health agenda. In Angola, maternal mortality remains high and the risk of pregnancy-related death was 1 in 32 during 2015. This study aims to identify demographic and social factors influencing antenatal care and health facility delivery among women in Dande and to understand their impact on birth outcomes. Methods This study is based on community–based longitudinal data collected by the Dande Health and Demographic Surveillance System between 2009 and 2015. Data on pregnancy outcomes (10,289 outcomes of 8,066 women) were collected for all reported pregnancies, including sociodemographic information, health services utilisation and women’s reproductive history. Logistic regression was used to investigate the determinants of birth outcomes, antenatal care attendance and institutionalised delivery. Findings Of the 10,289 pregnancy outcomes, 98.5% resulted in live births, 96.8% attended antenatal care, and 82.5% had four or more visits. Yet, 50.7% of the women delivered outside a health facility. Antenatal care attendance was a determinant of birth outcomes (stillbirth: unadjusted OR = 0.34 95% CI = 0.16–0.70; abortion: OR = 0.07 95% CI = 0.04–0.12). Older women, with lower education, living at a greater distance of a health facility and in rural areas, were less likely to use maternal health care. Having had previous pregnancies, namely resulting in live births, also decreased the likelihood of health care utilization by pregnant women. Conclusions The study identifies relevant social determinants for the utilisation of antenatal care, place of delivery and their impact on birth outcome, thereby providing insight on how best to address inequities in health care utilization."
https://openalex.org/W2969251273,"Candidemia has been considered a persistent public health problem with great impact on hospital costs and high mortality. We aimed to evaluate the epidemiology and prognostic factors of candidemia in a tertiary hospital in Northeast Brazil from January 2011 to December 2016. Demographic and clinical data of patients were retrospectively obtained from medical records and antifungal susceptibility profiling was performed using the broth microdilution method. A total of 68 episodes of candidemia were evaluated. We found an average incidence of 2.23 episodes /1000 admissions and a 30-day mortality rate of 55.9%. The most prevalent species were Candida albicans (35.3%), Candida tropicalis (27.4%), Candida parapsilosis (21.6%) and Candida glabrata (11.8%). Higher mortality rates were observed in cases of candidemia due to C. albicans (61.1%) and C. glabrata (100%), especially when compared to C. parapsilosis (27.3%). Univariate analysis revealed some variables which significantly increased the probability of death: older age (P = 0.022; odds ratio [OR] = 1.041), severe sepsis (P < 0.001; OR = 8.571), septic shock (P = 0.035; OR = 3.792), hypotension (P = 0.003; OR = 9.120), neutrophilia (P = 0.046; OR = 3.080), thrombocytopenia (P = 0.002; OR = 6.800), mechanical ventilation (P = 0.009; OR = 8.167) and greater number of surgeries (P = 0.037; OR = 1.920). Multivariate analysis showed that older age (P = 0.040; OR = 1.055), severe sepsis (P = 0.009; OR = 9.872) and hypotension (P = 0.031; OR = 21.042) were independently associated with worse prognosis. There was no resistance to amphotericin B, micafungin or itraconazole and a low rate of resistance to fluconazole (5.1%). However, 20.5% of the Candida isolates were susceptible dose-dependent (SDD) to fluconazole and 7.7% to itraconazole. In conclusion, our results could assist in the adoption of strategies to stratify patients at higher risk for developing candidemia and worse prognosis, in addition to improve antifungal management."
https://openalex.org/W2969747169,"Background Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) is a hepatic enzyme that regulates circulating low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels by binding to LDL receptors (LDLR) and promoting their degradation. Although PCSK9 inhibitors were shown to reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease, a warning was issued concerning their possible impact on cognitive functions. In Alzheimer’s disease (AD), it is believed that cognitive impairment is associated with cholesterol metabolism alterations, which could involve PCSK9. The main objective of this study is to determine if PCSK9 plays a significant role in the pre-symptomatic phase of the disease when the pathophysiological markers of AD unfolds and, later, when cognitive symptoms emerge. Methods and findings To test if PCSK9 is associated with AD pathology, we measured its expression levels in 65 autopsy confirmed AD brains and 45 age and gender matched controls. Messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) were quantified using real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and protein levels were quantified using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). PCSK9 was elevated in frontal cortices of AD subjects compared to controls, both at the mRNA and protein levels. LDLR protein levels were unchanged in AD frontal cortices, despite and upregulation at the mRNA level. To verify if PCSK9 dysregulation was observable before the onset of AD, we measured its expression in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of 104 “at-risk” subjects and contrasted it with known apolipoproteins levels and specific AD biomarkers using ELISAs. Positive correlations were found between CSF PCSK9 and apolipoprotein E (APOE), apolipoprotein J (APOJ or CLU), apolipoprotein B (APOB), phospho Tau (pTau) and total Tau. To investigate if PCSK9 levels were driven by genetic variants, we conducted an expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) study using bioinformatic tools and found two polymorphisms in strong association. Further investigation of these variants in two independent cohorts showed a female specific association with AD risk and with CSF Tau levels in cognitively impaired individuals. Conclusions PCSK9 levels differ between control and AD brains and its protein levels correlate with those of other lipoproteins and AD biomarkers even before the onset of the disease. PCSK9 regulation seems to be under tight genetic control in females only, with specific variants that could predispose to increased AD risk."
https://openalex.org/W2969565828,"We aimed to better understand how well postpartum blood loss and common postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) definitions (i.e. blood loss ≥500ml = PPH, ≥1000ml = ""severe"" PPH) correlate with postpartum anemia and fall in hemoglobin.Secondary analysis of data from three randomized trials that objectively measured postpartum blood loss and pre- and post-delivery hemoglobin among vaginal deliveries: one trial included 1056 home-births in Pakistan and two multi-country hospital-based trials included 1279 women diagnosed with PPH. We calculated Spearman's correlation coefficients (rs) for blood loss with hemoglobin drop and postpartum hemoglobin, and we compared PPH blood loss markers (≥500ml, ≥1000ml) with large hemoglobin drops (≥2 g/dL) and the threshold for moderate postpartum anemia (<10g/dL).In the Pakistan study and the multi-country trials, blood loss was weakly correlated with hemoglobin drop (Pakistan: rs = -0.220, multi-country trials: rs = -0.271) and postpartum hemoglobin (Pakistan: rs = -0.220, multi-country trials: rs = -0.316). In both the Pakistan and multi-country trials, hemoglobin drop ≥2 g/dL occurred in less than half of women with 500-999 ml blood loss (55/175 [31%] and 302/725 [42%], respectively) and was more common among women who bled ≥1000ml (19/28 [68%] and 347/554 [63%], respectively). Similarly, in the Pakistan and multi-country trials, postpartum anemia <10 g/dL was less frequent among women who bled 500-999 ml (55/175 [31%] and 390/725 [54%], respectively) and more frequent among women with ≥1000ml blood loss (20/28 [71%] and 416/554 [75%], respectively).Postpartum morbidity as measured by hemoglobin markers was common for women with blood loss ≥1000ml and relatively infrequent among women with blood loss 500-999ml. These findings reinforce the importance of severe PPH as the preferred outcome to be used in research. The weak correlation between blood loss and hemoglobin markers also suggests that this relationship is not straightforward and should be carefully interpreted."
https://openalex.org/W2969648250,"Extended soil contamination by polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) represents a global environmental issue that can hardly be addressed with the conventional remediation treatments. Rhizoremediation is a sustainable alternative, exploiting plants to stimulate in situ the degradative bacterial communities naturally occurring in historically polluted areas. This approach can be enhanced by the use of bacterial strains that combine PCB degradation potential with the ability to promote plant and root development. With this aim, we established a collection of aerobic bacteria isolated from the soil of the highly PCB-polluted site “SIN Brescia-Caffaro” (Italy) biostimulated by the plant Phalaris arundinacea. The strains, selected on biphenyl and plant secondary metabolites provided as unique carbon source, were largely dominated by Actinobacteria and a significant number showed traits of interest for remediation, harbouring genes homologous to bphA, involved in the PCB oxidation pathway, and displaying 2,3-catechol dioxygenase activity and emulsification properties. Several strains also showed the potential to alleviate plant stress through 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate deaminase activity. In particular, we identified three Rhodococcus strains able to degrade in vitro several PCB congeners and to promote lateral root emergence in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana in vivo. In addition, these strains showed the capacity to colonize the root system and to increase the plant biomass in PCB contaminated soil, making them ideal candidates to sustain microbial-assisted PCB rhizoremediation through a bioaugmentation approach."
https://openalex.org/W2969790973,"During late 1960s Green Revolution, researchers utilized semidwarf 1 (sd1) to improve the yield and lodging resistance in rice (Oryza sativa L.). However, sd1 has a negative effect to culm strength and biomass production. To increase yield dramatically in 21th century, development of next generation long-culm rice for non-lodging and high grain yield independent of sd1 has been needed. The present study developed Monster Rice 1, a long-culm and heavy-panicle type of rice line and compared it with Takanari, a high-yielding semidwarf rice variety about yield and lodging resistance associated traits. Brown rice yield and bending moment at breaking of the basal elongated internode were higher in Monster Rice 1 than those in Takanari due to a large number of spikelets per panicle and thicker culm. Furthermore, to identify QTLs with superior alleles for these traits, QTL and haplotype analyses were performed using F2 population and recombinant inbred lines derived from a cross between Monster Rice 1 and Takanari. The results from this study suggest that long-culm and heavy-panicle type of rice with a superior lodging resistance by culm strength can perform its high yield potential by using these identified QTLs contributing yield and lodging resistance."
https://openalex.org/W2969816203,"The gut microbiome is thought to remain stable into old age. Gut bacteria and their translocation may play a role in the development of coronary heart disease (CHD) by modulating cholesterol levels and immune responses, as well as by producing toxic metabolites and bacterial endotoxins. The association of changes in the gut microbiome with the severity of coronary atherosclerosis and the ability of gut bacteria themselves to translocate into coronary plaques has not been studied.As a part of the Tampere Sudden Death Study, we measured age-dependent changes in the relative ratios of major intestinal bacterial communities (Bacteroides species [spp.], the Clostridium leptum group, the Clostridium coccoides group, Bifidobacterium spp., Enterobactericeae, Lactobacillus spp.) and Streptococcus spp. in both feces and coronary plaques of the same male autopsy cases (n = 67, age range 44-95) using real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR). The area of coronary atherosclerotic lesions were measured by computer-assisted morphometry. Fecal bacterial DNA measurements from healthy volunteers served as a control for gut bacterial analyses of autopsy cases. The relative amount of bacterial DNA in a sample was determined with the comparative Cq method.The relative ratios of fecal Lactobacillus spp., Bifidobacterium spp., the Clostridium coccoides group, and Bacteroides spp. did not differ between controls and autopsy cases and showed no age-dependence. In contrast, the ratios of the Clostridium leptum group, Enterobactericeae, and Streptococcus spp. increased with age. Elevated relative ratios of fecal Enterobactericeae associated with a larger coronary plaque fibrotic area (p = 0.001), and the Clostridium leptum group with a larger calcification area (p = 0.015). Intestinal bacterial DNA could be amplified in 67.6% of the coronary plaques, the most common being Streptococcus spp. (41.0%), followed by Enterobactericeae (12.1%), Clostridium leptum (2.4%), and Lactobacillus spp. (2.4%). The percentages of Streptococcus spp. DNA decreased, and those of Enterobactericeae increased in coronary plaques along with age.DNA of the Clostridium leptum group and pathogenic Enterobactericeae increase in the gut microbiome with age and can be detected in the same individual's coronary plaques along with pathogenic Streptococcus spp., associating with more severe coronary atherosclerosis."

The intervention aimed to facilitate mothers’ mind-mindedness—attunement to their infants’ internal states. Mothers in the intervention group (n = 90) used the BabyMind app from their infants’ births and were followed up at age 6 months (n = 66). Mothers in the control group (n = 151) were recruited when their infants were age 6 months and had never used the BabyMind app. Mind-mindedness when interacting with their infants was significantly higher in intervention group mothers than in control group mothers. The intervention was equally effective in facilitating mind-mindedness in young and older mothers. These findings are discussed in terms of the potential for interventions utilizing smartphone apps to improve parenting and children’s developmental outcome in vulnerable and hard-to-reach groups."
https://openalex.org/W2969485391,"Human fluid intelligence emerges from the interactions of various cognitive processes. Although some classic models characterize intelligence as a unitary “general ability,” many distinct lines of research have suggested that it is possible to at least partially decompose intelligence into a set of subsidiary cognitive functions. Much of this work has focused on the relationship between intelligence and working memory, and more specifically between intelligence and the capacity-loading aspects of working memory. These theories focus on domain-general processing capacity limitations, rather than limitations specifically linked to working memory tasks. Performance on other capacity-constrained tasks, even those that have typically been given the label of “attention tasks,” may thus also be related to fluid intelligence. We tested a wide range of attention and working memory tasks in 7- to 9-year-old children and adults, and we used the results of these cognitive measures to predict intelligence scores. In a set of 13 measures we did not observe a single “positive manifold” that would indicate a general-ability understanding of intelligence. Instead, we found that a small number of measures were related to intelligence scores. More specifically, we found two tasks that are typically labeled as “attentional measures”, Multiple Object Tracking and Enumeration, and two tasks that are typically labeled as “working memory” measures, N-back and Spatial Span, were reliably related to intelligence. However, the links between attention and intelligence scores were fully mediated by working memory measures. In contrast, attention scores did not mediate the relations between working memory and intelligence. Furthermore, these patterns were indistinguishable across age groups, indicating a hierarchical cognitive basis of intelligence that is stable from childhood into adulthood."
https://openalex.org/W2969658647,"Porphyromonas gingivalis, an oral microorganism residing in the subgingival biofilm, may exert diverse pathogenicity depending on the presence of specific virulence factors, but its gene expression has not been completely established. This investigation aims to compare the transcriptomic profile of this pathogen when growing within an in vitro multispecies biofilm or in a planktonic state.P. gingivalis ATCC 33277 was grown in anaerobiosis within multi-well culture plates at 37°C under two conditions: (a) planktonic samples (no hydroxyapatite discs) or (b) within a multispecies-biofilm containing Streptococcus oralis, Actinomyces naeslundii, Veillonella parvula, Fusobacterium nucleatum and Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans deposited on hydroxyapatite discs. Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and Confocal Laser Scanning Microscopy (CLSM) combined with Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization (FISH) were used to verify the formation of the biofilm and the presence of P. gingivalis. Total RNA was extracted from both the multispecies biofilm and planktonic samples, then purified and, with the use of a microarray, its differential gene expression was analyzed. A linear model was used for determining the differentially expressed genes using a filtering criterion of two-fold change (up or down) and a significance p-value of <0.05. Differential expression was confirmed by Reverse Transcription-quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-qPCR).SEM verified the development of the multispecies biofilm and FISH confirmed the incorporation of P. gingivalis. The microarray demonstrated that, when growing within the multispecies biofilm, 19.1% of P. gingivalis genes were significantly and differentially expressed (165 genes were up-regulated and 200 down-regulated), compared with planktonic growth. These genes were mainly involved in functions related to the oxidative stress, cell envelope, transposons and metabolism. The results of the microarray were confirmed by RT-qPCR.Significant transcriptional changes occurred in P. gingivalis when growing in a multispecies biofilm compared to planktonic state."
https://openalex.org/W2969742371,"Viral hepatitis, syphilis, HIV, and tuberculosis infections in prisons have been identified globally as a public health problem. Tuberculosis (TB) and viral hepatitis co-infection may increase the risk of anti-tuberculosis treatment-induced hepatotoxicity, leading to the frequent cause of discontinuation of the first-line anti-tuberculosis drugs. Therefore, the aim of this cross-sectional study was to investigate the epidemiological features of HCV, HBV, syphilis and HIV infections among bacteriologically confirmed tuberculosis prisoners in Campo Grande (MS), Central Brazil. The participants who agreed to participate (n = 279) were interviewed and tested for the presence of active or current HCV, HBV, syphilis and HIV infections. The prevalence of HCV exposure was 4.7% (13/279; 95% CI 2.2–7.1). HCV RNA was detected in 84.6% (11/13) of anti-HCV positive samples. Out of 279 participants, 19 (6.8%; 95% CI 4.4–10.4) were HIV co-infected, 1.4% (4/279, 95% CI 0.5–3.8) had chronic hepatitis B virus (HBsAg positive) and 9.3% (26/279, 95% CI 6.4–13.4) had serological marker of exposure to hepatitis B virus (total anti-HBc positive). The prevalence of lifetime syphilis infection (anti-T. pallidum positive) was 10% (28/279, 95% CI 7.0–14.2) and active syphilis (VDRL ≥ 1/8 titre) was 5% (14/279, 95% CI 2.9–8.3). The prevalence of TB/HCV co-infection among prisoners with HIV (15.8%) was higher than among HIV-non-infected prisoners (3.8%; P<0.05). These results highlight the importance of hepatitis testing among prisoners with bacteriologically confirmed case of TB who can be more effectively and safely treated in order to reduce the side effects of hepatotoxic anti-TB drugs."
https://openalex.org/W2969463693,"In recent years, the sweet potato cultivar Jishu 25 has exhibited good characteristics for starch processing in northern China. The storage root dry matter yields of this cultivar can exceed one ton per mu (1/15 of a hectare) at nitrogen (N) rates of 60-90 kg ha-1 based on soil nutrient content. However, the effect of N fertilizer on the physicochemical properties of starches isolated from this cultivar has not been reported. In order to evaluate these effects, three different N rates, 0 (control, N0), 75 (N1), and 150 kg ha-1 (N2), were selected for a field experiment in 2017. The results showed that N1 exhibited the highest storage root yield and starch yield. Compared to the control group, N fertilizer significantly increased the total starch content while no significant difference was found in these between the N1 and N2 groups. The amylose (AM) content was highest in the N2 group and lowest in the N0 group. In addition, N fertilizer exhibited no significant effects on the values of [D(v, 0.9)], D [4, 3] and D [3, 2]. Compared to the control group, N1 demonstrated significantly higher setback viscosity (SV), while N2 showed significantly higher peak viscosity (PV), cold paste viscosity (CPV) and SV. However, there were no significant differences in the hot paste viscosity (HPV), peak time and pasting temperature between the N1 and N2 groups. For the thermal properties of starch, there were no significant differences in peak temperature (Tp), conclusion temperature (Tc) or gelatinization enthalpy (ΔH) between the N1 and N2 groups. Overall, for the starch samples of cultivar Jishu 25, N fertilizer exerts significant effects on the starch content, AM content and viscosity properties but little effect on the particle size distribution and ΔH. 75 kg N ha-1 can easily lead to substantial planting benefits from the high storage root yield, dry matter yield and total starch content of this cultivar."

However, there are limited studies comparing quantitative IVD measures of symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals.This study aimed to investigate possible differences in IVD tissue composition in patients with chronic LBP and controls using quantitative MRI and correlate IVD measures with the phenotype High-Intensity Zone (HIZ).The lumbar spine of 25 LBP-patients (25-69y, mean 38y, 11 males) and 12 controls (25-59y, mean 38y, 7 males) was examined with T2-mapping on a 1.5T MRI scanner. The mean T2-map value and standard deviation were determined in three midsagittal IVD slices and five sub-regions dividing each IVD in the sagittal plane. The distribution of T2-map values over the IVD was also determined with histogram analysis (Δμ = distribution width).When compared to controls, patient IVDs displayed lower values for all metrics, with significant differences for the T2-map value, standard deviation (p = 0.026) and Δμ (p = 0.048). Significantly different T2-map values were found between cohorts in the region representing nucleus pulposus and the border zone between nucleus pulposus and posterior annulus fibrosus (p = 0.047-0.050). Excluding all IVDs with HIZs resulted in no significant difference between the cohorts for any of the analyzed metrics (p = 0.053-0.995). Additionally, the T2-map values were lower in patients with HIZ in comparison without HIZ.Differences in IVD characteristics, measured with quantitative MRI, between LBP patients and controls were found. The T2-differences may reflect altered IVD function associated with HIZ. Future studies are recommended to explore IVD functionality in relation to HIZ and LBP."
https://openalex.org/W2969779928,"Research investigating the dynamics of coupled physical systems has demonstrated that small feedback delays can allow a dynamic response system to anticipate chaotic behavior. This counterintuitive phenomenon, termed anticipatory synchronization, has been observed in coupled electrical circuits, laser semi-conductors, and artificial neurons. Recent research indicates that the same process might also support the ability of humans to anticipate the occurrence of chaotic behavior in other individuals. Motivated by this latter work, the current study examined whether the process of feedback delay induced anticipatory synchronization could be employed to develop an interactive artificial agent capable of anticipating chaotic human movement. Results revealed that incorporating such delays within the movement-control dynamics of an artificial agent not only enhances an artificial agent’s ability to anticipate chaotic human behavior, but to synchronize with such behavior in a manner similar to natural human-human anticipatory synchronization. The implication of these findings for the development of human-machine interaction systems is discussed."

The human cell line HepaRG was selected for its best proximity to human primary hepatocytes. Global gene expression of differentiated HepaRG cells was assessed after 4 hours and 24 hours of exposure to GW3965 (LXR agonist), GW7647 (PPARα agonist), and GW4064 and CDCA (FXR synthetic and natural agonist, respectively). Our work revealed that, contrary to our expectations, NR specificity is largely present at the level of target genes, with a smaller than expected overlap of the set of genes targeted by the different NRs. It also highlighted the much broader activity of the synthetic FXR ligand compared to CDCA. More importantly, our results revealed that activation of FXR has a pro-proliferative effect and decreases the number of tetraploid (or binucleated) hepatocytes, while LXR inhibits the cell cycle progression, inducing hepatocyte differentiation and an increase in tetraploidism. Conclusion: these results highlight the importance of analyzing the different NR activities in a context allowing a direct confrontation of each receptor outcome, and reveals the opposite role of FXR and LXR in hepatocyte cells division and maturation."

Speckle tracking echocardiography (STE), which provides direct assessment of myocardial fiber deformation, may be useful in predicting prognosis.This study assessed STE in CDC and compared with idiopathic cardiomyopathy (IDC), and also examined the incremental prognostic information of STE over left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) in these patients.We enrolled 112 patients, age of 56.7 ± 11.8 years, 81 with CDC and 31 with IDC. STE indices were obtained at baseline in all patients. The endpoint was a composite of death, hospitalization for heart failure, or need for heart transplantation.Patients with IDC had worse LV systolic function compared to CDC, with LVEF of 34.5% vs 41.3%, p = 0.004, respectively. After adjustment for LVEF, there were no differences in STE values between CDC and IDC. During a median follow-up of 18.2 months (range, 11 to 22), 26 patients met the composite end point (24%). LV longitudinal strain was a strong predictor of adverse events, incremental to LVEF and E/e' ratio (HR 1.463, 95% CI 1.130-1.894; p = 0.004). The risk of cardiac events increased significantly in patients with GLS > - 12% (log-rank p = 0.035).STE indices were abnormal in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy, without differences between CDC and IDC. LV longitudinal strain was a powerful predictor of outcome, adding prognostic information beyond that provided by LVEF and E/e' ratio."
https://openalex.org/W2969907602,"Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi and rhizobia association with plants are two of the most successful plant-microbe associations that allow the assimilation of P and N by plants, respectively. These mutualistic interactions require a molecular dialogue, i.e., legume roots exude flavonoids or strigolactones which induce the Nod factors or Myc factors synthesis and secretion from the rhizobia or fungi, respectively. These Nod or Myc factors trigger several responses in the plant root, including calcium oscillations, and reactive oxygen species (ROS). Furthermore, superoxide and H2O2 have emerged as key components that regulate the transitions from proliferation to differentiation in the plant meristems. Similar to the root meristem, the nodule meristem accumulates superoxide and H2O2. Tetraspanins are transmembrane proteins that organize into tetraspanin web regions, where they recruit specific proteins into platforms required for signal transduction, membrane fusion, cell trafficking and ROS generation. Plant tetraspanins are scaffolding proteins associated with root radial patterning, biotic and abiotic stress responses, cell fate determination, and hormonal regulation and recently have been reported as a specific marker of exosomes in animal and plant cells and key players at the site of plant fungal infection. In this study, we conducted transcriptional profiling of the tetraspanin family in common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L. var. Negro Jamapa) to determine the specific expression patterns and subcellular localization of tetraspanins during nodulation or under mycorrhizal association. Our results demonstrate that the tetraspanins are transcriptionally modulated during the mycorrhizal association, but are also expressed in the infection thread and nodule meristem development. Subcellular localization indicates that tetraspanins have a key role in vesicular trafficking, cell division, and root hair polar growth."
https://openalex.org/W2969300328,"Forage fishes play an important role in marine ecosystems by transferring energy and nutrients through the food web. The population dynamics of forage species can therefore have cascading effects across multiple trophic levels. Here, we analyzed a 19-year dataset on Pinfish (Lagodon rhomboides) across four eastern Gulf of Mexico estuaries to investigate population dynamics, inter- and intra-annual synchrony, metapopulation portfolio effects, growth, and habitat effects. Young-of-year growth rates did not differ among estuaries. The population dynamics of these four systems were stable in the long-term, but highly dynamic inter-annually. Intra-annual dynamics were stable and predictable despite variation in long-term means. Some estuaries exhibited positive inter-annual synchrony, and all four estuaries were synchronous intra-annually. There was evidence for stronger portfolio effects for the entire four-estuary metapopulation, as well as for the two northern estuaries while the southern estuaries appeared to act as a single population. Submerged aquatic vegetation was by far the most important predictor for both presence and abundance of Pinfish. It is important to understand the factors driving forage fish population fluctuations to better predict ecosystem effects, including those to species of economic and ecological importance. These predictors can be useful for the implementation of ecosystem-based management decisions."
https://openalex.org/W2969914951,"Cell-to-cell communication is a key element of microvascular blood flow control, including rapidly carrying signals through the vascular endothelium in response to local stimuli. This cell-to-cell communication is negatively impacted during inflammation through the disruption of junctional integrity. Such disruption is associated with promoting the onset of cardiovascular diseases as a result of altered microvascular blood flow regulation. Therefore, understanding the mechanisms how inflammation drives microvascular dysfunction and compounds that mitigate such inflammation and dysfunction are of great interest for development. As such we aimed to investigate extracts of mushrooms as potential novel compounds. Using intravital microscopy, the medicinal mushroom, Inonotus obliquus was observed, to attenuate histamine-induced inflammation conducted vasodilation in second-order arterioles in the gluteus maximus muscle of C57BL/6 mice. Mast cell activation by C48/80 similarly disrupted endothelial junctions and conducted vasodilation but only histamine was blocked by the histamine antagonist, pyrilamine not C48/80 suggesting the importance of mast cell activation. Data presented here supports that histamine induced inflammation is a major disruptor of junctional integrity, and highlights the important anti-inflammatory properties of Inonotus obliquus focusing future assessment of mast cells as putative target for Inonotus obliquus."
https://openalex.org/W2969552717,"Insect herbivores can manipulate host plants to inhibit defenses. Insects that induce plant galls are excellent examples of these interactions. The Hessian fly (HF, Mayetiola destructor) is a destructive pest of wheat (Triticum spp.) that occurs in nearly all wheat producing globally. Under compatible interactions (i.e., successful HF establishment), HF larvae alter host tissue physiology and morphology for their benefit, manifesting as the development of plant nutritive tissue that feeds the larva and ceases plant cell division and elongation. Under incompatible interactions (i.e., unsuccessful HF establishment), plants respond to larval feeding by killing the larva, permitting normal plant development. We used reflectance spectroscopy to characterize whole-plant functional trait responses during both compatible and incompatible interactions and related these findings with morphological and gene expression observations from earlier studies. Spectral models successfully characterized wheat foliar traits, with mean goodness of fit statistics of 0.84, 0.85, 0.94, and 0.69 and percent root mean square errors of 22, 10, 6, and 20%, respectively, for nitrogen and carbon concentrations, leaf mass per area, and total phenolic content. We found that larvae capable of generating compatible interactions successfully manipulated host plant chemical and morphological composition to create a more hospitable environment. Incompatible interactions resulted in lower host plant nutritional quality, thicker leaves, and higher phenolic levels. Spectral measurements successfully characterized wheat responses to compatible and incompatible interactions, providing an excellent example of the utility of Spectral phenotyping in quantifying responses of specific plant functional traits associated with insect resistance."
https://openalex.org/W2969570222,"Objectives To assess the impact of sources of drug information on antibiotic prescribing patterns (quantity and quality) among primary care physicians. Methods We conducted a cohort study on primary care physicians who were actively engaged in medical practice in 2010 in a region in north-west Spain (Galicia), fulfilling inclusion criteria (n = 2100). As the independent variable, we took the perceived utility of 6 sources of information on antibiotics, as measured by the validated KAAR-11 questionnaire. As dependent variables, we used: (1) a quality indicator (appropriate quality, defined as any case where 6 of the 12 indicators proposed by the European Surveillance of Antimicrobial Consumption Network [ESAC-Net] were better than the mean values for Spain); and, (2) a quantity indicator (high prescribing), defined as any case where defined daily doses (DDD) per 1 000 inhabitants per day of antibacterials for systemic use were higher than the mean values for Spain. The adjusted odds ratio for a change in the interquartile range (IqOR) for each sources of information on antibiotics was calculated using Generalized Linear Mixed Models. Results The questionnaire response rate was 68%. Greater perceived utility of pharmaceutical sales representatives increases the risk of having high prescribing (1/IqOR = 2.50 [95%CI: 1.63–3.66]) and reduces the probability of having appropriate quality (1/IqOR = 2.28 [95%CI: 1.77–3.01]). Greater perceived utility of clinical guidelines increases the probability of having appropriate quality (1/IqOR = 1.25 [95%CI: 1.02–1.54]) and reduces the probability of high prescribing (1/IqOR = 1.25 [95%CI: 1.02–1.54]). Conclusions Sources of information on antibiotics are an important determinant of the quantity and quality of antibiotic prescribing in primary care. Commercial sources of information influence prescribing negatively, and clinical guidelines are associated with better indicators."
https://openalex.org/W2969712202,"Key to scientific integrity is ensuring that research findings are considered credible by scientific peers, practitioners, policymakers and the public. Industry sponsorship of nutritional research can result in bias and raises significant professional, public and media concern. Yet, there is no international consensus on how to prevent or manage conflicts of interest for researchers considering engaging with the food industry. This study aimed to determine internationally agreed principles to guide interactions between population health researchers and the food industry to prevent or manage conflicts of interest. We used a two-stage, online Delphi study for researchers (n = 100 in 28 countries), and an online survey for stakeholders (n = 84 in 26 countries). Levels of agreement were sought with 56 principles derived from a systematic review. Respondent comments were analysed using qualitative content analysis. High levels of agreement on principles were achieved for both groups (researchers 68%; stakeholders 65%). Highest levels of agreement were with principles concerning research methods and governance. More contentious were principles that required values-based decision-making, such as determining which elements of the commercial sector are acceptable to interact with. These results provide the basis for developing internationally-agreed guidelines for population health researchers governing interactions with the food industry."
https://openalex.org/W2969226966,"Freely crawling cells are often viewed as randomly moving Brownian particles but they generally exhibit some directional persistence. This property is often related to their zigzag motile behaviors that can be described as a noisy but temporally structured sequence of ""runs"" and ""turns."" However, its underlying biophysical mechanism is largely unexplored. Here, we carefully investigate the collective actin wave dynamics associated with the zigzag-crawling movements of microglia (as primary brain immune cells) employing a number of different quantitative imaging modalities including synthetic aperture microscopy and optical diffraction tomography, as well as conventional fluorescence imaging and scanning electron microscopy. Interestingly, we find that microglia exhibit two distinct types of actin waves working at two quite different time scales and locations, and they seem to serve different purposes. One type of actin waves is fast ""peripheral ruffles"" arising spontaneously with an oscillating period of about 6 seconds at some portion of the leading edge of crawling microglia, where the vigorously biased peripheral ruffles seem to set the direction of a new turn (in 2-D free space). When the cell turning events are inhibited with a physical confinement (in 1-D track), the peripheral ruffles still exist at the leading edge with no bias but showing phase coherence in the cell crawling direction. The other type is ""dorsal actin waves"" which also exhibits an oscillatory behavior but with a much longer period of around 2 minutes compared to the fast ""peripheral ruffles"". Dorsal actin waves (whether the cell turning events are inhibited or not) initiate in the lamellipodium just behind the leading edge, travelling down toward the core region of the cell and disappear. Such dorsal wave propagations seem to be correlated with migration of the cell. Thus, we may view the dorsal actin waves are connected with the ""run"" stage of cell body, whereas the fast ruffles at the leading front are involved in the ""turn"" stage."
https://openalex.org/W2969472489,"Globally, HIV/AIDS is a leading cause of morbidity worldwide among reproductive-aged cisgender women, highlighting the importance of understanding effects of contraceptives on HIV-1 risk. Some observational studies suggest there may be an increased risk of HIV-1 acquisition among women using the long-acting injectable progestin contraceptive, depo-medroxyprogesterone acetate. The potential mechanism of this susceptibility is unclear. There are few data on the role of the upper female reproductive tract in HIV-1 transmission, and the mechanisms of HIV-1 infection are likely to differ in the upper compared to the lower reproductive tract due to differences in tissue composition and variable effects of sex steroids on mucosal immune cell distribution and activity. In this study, we measured the susceptibility of mucosal immune cells from the upper female reproductive tract to HIV-1 entry using the virion-based HIV-1 fusion assay in samples from healthy female volunteers. We studied 37 infectious molecular clones for their ability to fuse to cells from endometrial biopsies in three participants and found that subtype (B or C) and origin of the virus (transmitted founder or chronic control) had little influence on HIV-1 fusion susceptibility. We studied the effect of contraceptives on HIV-1 susceptibility of immune cells from the cervix, endometrium and peripheral blood by comparing fusion susceptibility in four groups: users of the copper intrauterine device (IUD), levonorgestrel-containing oral contraceptive, levonorgestrel-containing IUD and unexposed controls (n = 58 participants). None of the contraceptives was associated with higher rates of HIV-1 entry into female reproductive tract cells compared to control samples from the mid-luteal phase."
https://openalex.org/W2969497989,"Purpose We aimed to describe bone formation and resorption markers in generally healthy prepubertal children using total alkaline phosphatase (tALP), osteocalcin (OC) and β-isomerized C-terminal telopeptides of type I collagen (β-CTx) serum concentrations and to estimate markers’ correlations with anthropometric growth (height, weight, body mass index and trajectories of weight gain) as well as bone mineral content (BMC) and areal density (aBMD). Methods We assessed 395 7-year-old children from the Generation XXI cohort with tALP, OC and β-CTx concentrations determined from a fasting venous blood sample and BMC/aBMD measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. Gender-specific reference intervals for tALP, OC and β-CTx in 7-year-old children were established by calculating the 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles. Pearson and partial correlation coefficients (controlling for sex, age, body size and season) between bone markers and growth measures were computed. Results tALP increased with height (rpartial controlled for sex = 0.26, 95%CI: 0.17, 0.35), was higher in overweight than in healthy weight children, and in children who gained weight above average during infancy. No correlations were found between OC or β-CTx and growth. In girls, OC was slightly correlated with subtotal BMC (rpartial = 0.22, 95%CI: 0.08, 0.35), subtotal aBMD (rpartial = 0.20, 95%CI: 0.06, 0.33) and lumbar spine aBMD (rpartial = 0.23, 95%CI: 0.09, 0.36). tALP and β-CTx were not correlated with any of the DXA-derived bone measures. Conclusion This study contributed to the description of bone turnover at 7 years of age and suggested that bone metabolism markers measured in a single point in time have limited ability to describe anthropometric growth and overall bone status in generally healthy prepubertal children."
https://openalex.org/W2969842856,"The aim of this study was to compare the dynamics of heart rate (HR) response to exercise using a cycle ergometer (CE) and a treadmill (TM). Using a sample of 25 healthy male participants, the time constant of HR dynamics was estimated for both modalities in response to square-wave excitation.The principal finding was that the time constant of heart-rate dynamics around somewhat-hard exercise intensity (Borg rating of perceived exertion = 13) does not differ significantly between the CE and TM (68.7 s ± 21.5 s vs. 62.5 s ± 18.5 s [mean ± standard deviation]; CE vs. TM; p = 0.20). An observed moderate level of evidence that root-mean-square model error was higher for the CE than for the TM (2.5 bpm ± 0.5 bpm vs. 2.2 bpm ± 0.5 bpm, p = 0.059) may reflect a decrease in heart rate variability with increasing HR intensity because, in order to achieve similar levels of perceived intensity, mean heart rate for the CE was ∼25 bpm lower than for the TM.These results have important implications for model-based design of automatic HR controllers, because, in principle, the same dynamic controller, merely scaled according to the differing steady-state gains, should be able to be applied to the CE and TM exercise modalities."
https://openalex.org/W2969676345,"Transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β) has been shown to play a critical role in pathogenesis of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) although the precise role of TGF-β signaling remains uncertain. A recent report has shown that periostin (Pn) is one of the most upregulated proteins in human PAH lung compared with healthy lungs. We established type I TGF-β receptor knockout mice specifically with Pn expressing cell (Pn-Cre/Tgfb1fl/fl mice). Increases in PA pressure and pulmonary artery muscularization were induced by hypoxia of 10% oxygen for 4 weeks. Lung Pn expression was markedly induced by 4 week-hypoxia. Pn-Cre/Tgfb1fl/fl mice showed lower right ventricular pressure elevation, inhibition of PA medial thickening. Fluorescent co-immunostaining showed that Smad3 activation in Pn expressing cell is attenuated. These results suggest that TGF-β signaling in Pn expressing cell may have an important role in the pathogenesis of PAH by controlling medial thickening."
https://openalex.org/W2969289801,"Pentraxin-3 (PTX3) is a multifunctional protein involved in both innate and adaptive immunity. Glucocorticoid (GC) is the first-line therapy to mitigate airway inflammation in asthma. Previous pieces of evidence showed that GC has divergent effects on PTX3 production in various cell types. The molecular mechanisms controlling PTX3 expression in HASMC are, however, not yet characterized. In this study, we demonstrate that the synthetic GC, dexamethasone (DEX) increases the expression of PTX3 both at the protein and mRNA levels. We also found that such an effect of DEX was dependent on de novo protein synthesis and the GC receptor (GR). While DEX increases PTX3 mRNA stability, it did not affect its promoter activity. Interestingly, HASMC pre-treated with p42/p44 ERK inhibitor, but not with p38 or JNK-MAPK inhibitors, significantly interfered with DEX-induced PTX3 secretion. Taken together, our data suggest that GC regulates PTX3 expression in HASMC through transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms in a GR and ERK-dependent manner."
https://openalex.org/W2969325471,"Young adults face unemployment-related challenges, particularly in low- and middle-income countries. Self-employment is encouraged by the Tanzanian government and international institutions such as the World Bank. It has been found that young adults who are employed or self-employed show more functional independence and less inequality and social polarization, as well as a decrease in deviant behaviour. However, limited knowledge and skills related to entrepreneurial activities contribute to lack of motivation towards self-employment among young adults. In order to examine these behaviours, an intervention study implementing an entrepreneurship and beekeeping training in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania was conducted. After completion of the intervention, a qualitative study was conducted that used focus group discussions (FGDs) to explore the experiences and changes in behaviour of young adults following the intervention. A total of 36 of the original 57 young adults from four camps who fully participated in the four arms of interventions were recruited. Qualitative content analysis was used to analyze the FGD data. Three themes emerged from the findings: establishment and maintenance of an entrepreneurial business, changes in behaviour, and perceived challenges. Improved entrepreneurial skills, customer care, and financial management were expressed as positive changes the participants attained relating to business management. Similarly, changes in the participants’ behaviours, attitudes, and lifestyle practices led to improved health and increased recognition and respect in their communities. Insufficient start-up capital and long intervals between sessions were the main challenges. The study showed an improvement in the ability of the participants to generate the human, social, and financial capital prerequisite to business development. Increase in customer care, social capital and financial management are key factors for successful microbusiness activities for stable self-employment."
https://openalex.org/W2969584633,"The aim of this study was to describe the specific gross and radiographic anatomy of the digestive tract of inland bearded dragons (Pogona vitticeps). Eleven bearded dragon cadavers of both sexes (6 females, 5 males) were dissected to examine, measure, and document the specific gross anatomy of the alimentary canal. Measurements collected from the cadavers included snout-vent length, total length of the alimentary canal, and the lengths of the individual sections of the gastrointestinal tract, including the esophagus, stomach, small intestine, ampulla coli, isthmus coli, rectum, and the distance from the coprodeum to the vent opening. Twenty-two healthy adult bearded dragons (13 females, 9 males) maintained under standardized husbandry conditions underwent a physical examination, blood collection, and whole-body dorsoventral and lateral survey radiographs; these animals were used to provide the radiographic images of the complete digestive tract. For the subsequent contrast passage studies, two different contrast media, barium sulfate (BaSO4, Barilux suspension) and an iodinated ionic radiocontrast agent (Sodium meglumine amidotrizoate [SMAT], Gastrografin), were used. Water-diluted Barilux suspension (dose 9 ml/kg) was administered orally to 5 bearded dragons, while Gastrografin (dose 5ml/kg) was administered orally to 21 bearded dragons. Four animals were used for both contrast media studies, but received a break of four weeks in between. Dorsoventral and laterolateral radiographs were collected at 0 (baseline), 15, 30, and 45 minutes and 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 24, 30, and 36 hours after each contrast medium was administered. Both contrast media were found to illustrate the alimentary tracts in the adult bearded dragons. Transit time was substantially faster with SMAT, and SMAT illustrated the entire gastrointestinal tract within 36 hours; BaSO4 did not fully illustrate the gastrointestinal tract in 36 hours. These results might serve as a guideline for the interpretation of subsequent contrast studies in this lizard species."
https://openalex.org/W2969711097,"Background From 2007 through 2010, a large epidemic of acute Q fever occurred in the Netherlands. Patients with cardiac valvulopathy are at high risk to develop chronic Q fever after an acute infection. This patient group was not routinely screened, so it is unknown whether all their chronic infections were diagnosed. This study aims to investigate how many chronic Q fever patients can be identified by routinely screening patients with valvulopathy and to establish whether the policy of not screening should be changed. Methods In a cross-sectional study (2016–2017) in a hospital at the epicentre of the Q fever epidemic, a blood sample was taken from patients 18 years and older who presented with cardiac valvulopathy. The sample was tested for IgG antibodies against phase I and II of Coxiella burnetii using an immunofluorescence assay. An IgG phase II titre of ≥1:64 was considered serological evidence of a previous Q fever infection. An IgG phase I titre of ≥1:512 was considered suspicious for a chronic infection, and these patients were referred for medical examination. Results Of the 904 included patients, 133 (15%) had evidence of a previous C. burnetii infection, of whom 6 (5%) had a chronic infection on medical examination. Conclusions In a group of high-risk patients with a heart valve defect, we diagnosed new chronic Q fever infections seven years after the epidemic, emphasizing the need for screening of this group to prevent complications in those not yet diagnosed in epidemic areas."
https://openalex.org/W2969953902,"Introduction Plasmodium falciparum synthesizes phosphatidylcholine for the membrane development through serine decarboxylase–phosphoethanolamine methyltransferase pathway for growth in human host. Phosphoethanolamine-methyltransferase (PfPMT) is a crucial enzyme for the synthesis of phosphocholine which is a precursor for phosphatidylcholine synthesis and is considered as a pivotal drug target as it is absent in the host. The inhibition of PfPMT may kill malaria parasite and hence is being considered as potential target for rational antimalarial drug designing. Methods In this study, we have used computer aided drug designing (CADD) approaches to establish potential PfPMT inhibitors from Asinex compound library virtually screened for ADMET and the docking affinity. The selected compounds were tested for in-vitro schizonticidal, gametocidal and cytotoxicity activity. Nontoxic compounds were further studied for PfPMT enzyme specificity and antimalarial efficacy for P. berghei in albino mice model. Results Our results have identified two nontoxic PfPMT competitive inhibitors ASN.1 and ASN.3 with better schizonticidal and gametocidal activity which were found to inhibit PfPMT at IC50 1.49μM and 2.31μM respectively. The promising reduction in parasitaemia was found both in orally (50 & 10 mg/kg) and intravenous (IV) (5& 1 mg/kg) however, the better growth inhibition was found in intravenous groups. Conclusion We report that the compounds containing Pyridinyl-Pyrimidine and Phenyl-Furan scaffolds as the potential inhibitors of PfPMT and thus may act as promising antimalarial inhibitor candidates which can be further optimized and used as leads for template based antimalarial drug development."
https://openalex.org/W2969231006,"Rejection of solid organ grafts is regarded to be dependent on T cell responses. Nonetheless, numerous studies have focused on the contribution of NK cells in this process, resulting in contradictory theories. While some conclude that there is no participation of NK cells, others found an inflammatory or regulative role of NK cells. However, the experimental settings are rarely comparable with regard to challenged species, strain combinations or the nature of the graft. Thus, clear definition of NK cell contribution might be impeded by these circumstances. In this study we performed heterotopic heart transplantation (HTx) in rats, choosing one donor-recipient-combination leading to a fast and a second leading to a prolonged course of graft rejection. We intervened in the rejection process, by depletion of recipient NK cells on the one hand and by injection of activated NK cells syngeneic to the recipients on the other. The fast course of rejection could not be influenced by any of the NK cell manipulative treatments. However, the more prolonged course of rejection was highly susceptible to depletion of NK cells, resulting in significant acceleration of rejection, while injection of NK cells induced acceptance of the grafts. We suggest that, depending on the specific setting, NK cells can attenuate the first trigger of immune response, which allows establishing the regulatory activity leading to tolerance of the graft."
https://openalex.org/W2969357510,"The relationship between the constructs of perceived control and symptoms of mood disorders has been demonstrated. The current study evaluates cultural values both as an individual difference moderating variable and as one of the mechanisms through which the association between perceived control and mood disturbances may operate. The hypotheses were examined with a sample of 615 participants recruited in Saudi Arabia. Participants completed measures of perceived control, individualism and collectivism, and symptoms of depression and bipolar disorder. In general, the results supported a model in which higher levels of perceived control promote a less symptomatic mood state. In most cases, cultural values positively mediated the relationship between perceived control and mood disturbance with lower symptom levels predicted. However, when the components of perceived control were examined separately, high perceived mastery together with highly individualistic values predicted higher levels of bipolar symptoms. In this sample, there was less evidence of cultural values moderating the control–mood disturbance relationship. Only one moderator relationship was identified, which showed low control linking to higher symptom levels only in those who disagreed with individualistic values. Overall, our data are in agreement with the notion that pre-existing cultural values have an important effect on mood disorder symptoms."
https://openalex.org/W2969565239,"One of the main challenges in plant breeding programs is the efficient quantification of the genotype-by-environment interaction (GEI). The presence of significant GEI may create difficulties for breeders in the selection and recommendation of superior genotypes for a wide environmental network. Among the diverse statistical procedures developed for this purpose, we highlight those based on mixed models and factor analysis that are called factor analytic (FA) models. However, some inferential issues are related to the factor analytic model, such as Heywood cases that make the model non-identifiable. Moreover, the representation of the loads and factors in the conventional biplot does not involve any measurement of uncertainty. In this work, we propose dealing with the FA model using the Bayesian framework with direct sampling of factor loadings via spectral decomposition; this guarantees identifiability in the estimation process and eliminates the need for the rotationality of factor loadings or imposition of any ad hoc constraints. We used simulated and real data to illustrate the method’s application in multi-environment trials (MET) and to compare it with traditional FA mixed models on controlled unbalancing. In general, the Bayesian FA model was robust under different simulated unbalanced levels, presenting the superior predictive ability of missing data when compared to competing models, such as those based on FA mixed models. In addition, for some scenarios, the classical FA mixed model failed in estimating the full FA model, illustrating the parametric problems of convergence in these models. Our results suggest that Bayesian factorial models might be successfully used in plant breeding for MET analysis."
https://openalex.org/W2969720544,"The analyses of large volumes of metagenomic data extracted from aggregate populations of microscopic organisms residing on and in the human body are advancing contemporary understandings of the integrated participation of microbes in human health and disease. Next generation sequencing technology facilitates said analyses in terms of diversity, community composition, and differential abundance by filtering and binning microbial 16S rRNA genes extracted from human tissues into operational taxonomic units. However, current statistical tools restrict study designs to investigations of limited numbers of host characteristics mediated by limited numbers of samples potentially yielding a loss of relevant information. This paper presents a Bayesian hierarchical negative binomial model as an efficient technique capable of compensating for multivariable sets including tens or hundreds of host characteristics as covariates further expanding analyses of human microbiome count data. Simulation studies reveal that the Bayesian hierarchical negative binomial model provides a desirable strategy by often outperforming three competing negative binomial model in terms of type I error while simultaneously maintaining consistent power. An application of the Bayesian hierarchical negative binomial model using subsets of the open data published by the American Gut Project demonstrates an ability to identify operational taxonomic units significantly differentiable among persons diagnosed by a medical professional with either inflammatory bowel disease or irritable bowel syndrome that are consistent with contemporary gastrointestinal literature."
https://openalex.org/W2969388363,"The goal of this study was to determine if there were differences among stakeholders in the values they attribute to soil ecosystem services from plantation forests in New Zealand. Groups of forest-associated stakeholders were identified (e.g. land owners, forest owners, wood processors, and recreational forest users) and surveyed to assess their cultural background (indigenous New Zealand Māori or not) and then the relative importance they placed on 10 forest soil ecosystem services. Across all survey respondents, very high importance was placed on the ability of soils to sustain forest growth across multiple plantings/rotations (sustainable production). Interestingly, this was more highly valued than maximising short-term production. Māori placed greater importance on forest ecosystem resilience, provenance and kaitiakitanga (sensu stewardship of resources), water quality, and harvest of food and/or medicines from forests than non-Māori. These results demonstrate inherent cultural differences in valuing the range of forest ecosystem services that soils support. It is important that cultural views are understood and integrated into future soil health testing schemes to reflect the needs of all stakeholders. Ultimately, this work will help increase the sustainability of planted forest ecosystems in New Zealand, ensure the forestry sectors social licence to operate, and add value to forest products by demonstrating environmental and cultural stewardship of forest products."

Without knowing the source of infection clinicians are dependent on systematic reports on the bacterial spectrum and susceptibility tests of the specific infection in their patient community. This study was based on a retrospective chart review of patients presenting to our outpatient clinic with acute hand infections. We documented patient demographics, the etiology, location, culture tests of the infection and analyzed if certain bacteria could be cultured significantly more often in certain etiologies or in specific sites of the hand infection. Susceptibility tests were added. Bacterial swabs of 204 patients were analyzed. Overall S. aureus was found in 53% of all cases, in only one case revealed methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA). There was no significant difference in the bacterial spectrum according to the etiology of the hand infections, except for animal bites where Pasteurella multocida was the dominating bacteria in 63% of all cases. Amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, fluoroquinolones, and piperacillin were effective against the main bacteria. Our study confirms the previously published antibiotic resistance reports and reinforces the current antibiotic treatment guidelines also in this western European population."
https://openalex.org/W2969949008,"HIV-1 Gag is a large multidomain poly-protein with flexible unstructured linkers connecting its globular subdomains. It is compact when in solution but assumes an extended conformation when assembled within the immature HIV-1 virion. Here, we use molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to quantitatively characterize the intra-domain interactions of HIV-1 Gag. We find that the matrix (MA) domain and the C-terminal subdomain CActd of the CA capsid domain can form a bound state. The bound state, which is held together primarily by interactions between complementary charged and polar residues, stabilizes the compact state of HIV-1 Gag. We calculate the depth of the attractive free energy potential between the MA/ CActd sites and find it to be about three times larger than the dimerization interaction between the CActd domains. Sequence analysis shows high conservation within the newly-found intra-Gag MA/CActd binding site, as well as its spatial proximity to other well known elements of Gag –such as CActd’s SP1 helix region, its inositol hexaphosphate (IP6) binding site and major homology region (MHR), as well as the MA trimerization site. Our results point to a high, but yet undetermined, functional significance of the intra-Gag binding site. Recent biophysical experiments that address the binding specificity of Gag are interpreted in the context of the MA/CActd bound state, suggesting an important role in selective packaging of genomic RNA by Gag."
https://openalex.org/W2969448574,"Complex network theory has been successful at unveiling the topology of the brain and showing alterations to the network structure due to brain disease, cognitive function and behavior. Functional connectivity networks (FCNs) represent different brain regions as the nodes and the connectivity between them as the edges of a graph. Graph theoretic measures provide a way to extract features from these networks enabling subsequent characterization and discrimination of networks across conditions. However, these measures are constrained mostly to binary networks and highly dependent on the network size. In this paper, we propose a novel graph-to-signal transform that overcomes these shortcomings to extract features from functional connectivity networks. The proposed transformation is based on classical multidimensional scaling (CMDS) theory and transforms a graph into signals such that the Euclidean distance between the nodes of the network is preserved. In this paper, we propose to use the resistance distance matrix for transforming weighted functional connectivity networks into signals. Our results illustrate how well-known network structures transform into distinct signals using the proposed graph-to-signal transformation. We then compute well-known signal features on the extracted graph signals to discriminate between FCNs constructed across different experimental conditions. Based on our results, the signals obtained from the graph-to-signal transformation allow for the characterization of functional connectivity networks, and the corresponding features are more discriminative compared to graph theoretic measures."
https://openalex.org/W2969822293,"Pollen can decrease (via reduced consumption) or increase (via numerical response) an omnivores consumption of animal prey. Although pollen can increase predation pressure through numerical responses of omnivores, pollen may also suppress predation by increasing omnivore interactions with conspecifics. Despite this potential, studies of the impacts of pollen on predation by omnivores often overlook the effect of these tissues on intraspecific interactions between omnivores. We designed three studies to examine how Spartina foliosa pollen and conspecific density impact scale insect prey consumption by ladybeetle (Naemia seriata) omnivores. First, we assessed how pollen impacts scale insect consumption by isolated ladybeetles. Second, we measured how pollen influences ladybeetle prey suppression when numerical responses were possible. Third, because initial experiments suggested the consumption rates of individual ladybeetles depended on conspecific density, we compared per capita consumption rates of ladybeetles across ladybeetle density. Pollen did not influence prey consumption by isolated ladybeetles. When numerical responses were possible, pollen did not influence total predation on prey despite increasing ladybeetle density, suggesting that pollen decreased per capita prey consumption by ladybeetles. The discrepancy between these studies is likely a consequence of differences in ladybeetle density—the presence of only two other conspecifics decreased per capita prey consumption by 76%. Our findings suggest that pollen may not alter the population level effects of omnivores on prey when omnivore numerical responses are offset by reductions in per capita predation rate."
