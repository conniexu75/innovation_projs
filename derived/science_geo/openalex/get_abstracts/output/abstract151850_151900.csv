https://openalex.org/W2035809873,"In multicellular organisms, circadian oscillators are organized into multitissue systems which function as biological clocks that regulate the activities of the organism in relation to environmental cycles and provide an internal temporal framework. To investigate the organization of a mammalian circadian system, we constructed a transgenic rat line in which luciferase is rhythmically expressed under the control of the mouse Per1 promoter. Light emission from cultured suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) of these rats was invariably and robustly rhythmic and persisted for up to 32 days in vitro. Liver, lung, and skeletal muscle also expressed circadian rhythms, which damped after two to seven cycles in vitro. In response to advances and delays of the environmental light cycle, the circadian rhythm of light emission from the SCN shifted more rapidly than did the rhythm of locomotor behavior or the rhythms in peripheral tissues. We hypothesize that a self-sustained circadian pacemaker in the SCN entrains circadian oscillators in the periphery to maintain adaptive phase control, which is temporarily lost following large, abrupt shifts in the environmental light cycle."

https://openalex.org/W1955276614,"The adaptor protein Hop mediates the association of the molecular chaperones Hsp70 and Hsp90. The TPR1 domain of Hop specifically recognizes the C-terminal heptapeptide of Hsp70 while the TPR2A domain binds the C-terminal pentapeptide of Hsp90. Both sequences end with the motif EEVD. The crystal structures of the TPR–peptide complexes show the peptides in an extended conformation, spanning a groove in the TPR domains. Peptide binding is mediated by electrostatic interactions with the EEVD motif, with the C-terminal aspartate acting as a two-carboxylate anchor, and by hydrophobic interactions with residues upstream of EEVD. The hydrophobic contacts with the peptide are critical for specificity. These results explain how TPR domains participate in the ordered assembly of Hsp70–Hsp90 multichaperone complexes."

https://openalex.org/W1997196319,"Memory T cells maintain their numbers for long periods after antigen exposure. Here we show that CD8+ T cells of memory phenotype divide slowly in animals. This division requires interleukin-15 and is markedly increased by inhibition of interleukin-2 (IL-2). Therefore, the numbers of CD8+ memory T cells in animals are controlled by a balance between IL-15 and IL-2."
https://openalex.org/W2047028501,"HIV-1 and other lentiviruses have the unique property among retroviruses to replicate in nondividing cells. This property relies on the use of a nuclear import pathway enabling the viral DNA to cross the nuclear membrane of the host cell. In HIV-1 reverse transcription, a central strand displacement event consecutive to central initiation and termination of plus strand synthesis creates a plus strand overlap: the central DNA flap. We show here that the central DNA flap acts as a cis-determinant of HIV-1 DNA nuclear import. Wild-type viral linear DNA is almost entirely imported into the nucleus where it integrates or circularizes. In contrast, mutant viral DNA, which lacks the DNA flap, accumulates in infected cells as unintegrated linear DNA, at the vicinity of the nuclear membrane. Consistently, HIV-1 vectors devoid of DNA flap exhibit a strong defect of nuclear import, which can be corrected to wild-type levels by reinsertion of the DNA flap sequence."

They are also reproductively dominant2 and strongly influence forest structure, composition, gap dynamics, hydrology2 and carbon storage3. Here we show that forest fragmentation in central Amazonia is having a disproportionately severe effect on large trees, the loss of which will have major impacts on the rainforest ecosystem."

https://openalex.org/W1991820785,"Schizophrenia is a complex disorder, and there is substantial evidence supporting a genetic etiology. Despite this, prior attempts to localize susceptibility loci have produced predominantly suggestive findings. A genome-wide scan for schizophrenia susceptibility loci in 22 extended families with high rates of schizophrenia provided highly significant evidence of linkage to chromosome 1 (1q21-q22), with a maximum heterogeneity logarithm of the likelihood of linkage (lod) score of 6.50. This linkage result should provide sufficient power to allow the positional cloning of the underlying susceptibility gene."
https://openalex.org/W3099422532,"The realization that electron localization in disordered systems (Anderson localization) is ultimately a wave phenomenon has led to the suggestion that photons could be similarly localized by disorder. This conjecture attracted wide interest because the differences between photons and electrons - in their interactions, spin statistics, and methods of injection and detection - may open a new realm of optical and microwave phenomena, and allow a detailed study of the Anderson localization transition undisturbed by the Coulomb interaction. To date, claims of three-dimensional photon localization have been based on observations of the exponential decay of the electromagnetic wave as it propagates through the disordered medium. But these reports have come under close scrutiny because of the possibility that the decay observed may be due to residual absorption, and because absorption itself may suppress localization. Here we show that the extent of photon localization can be determined by a different approach - measurement of the relative size of fluctuations of certain transmission quantities. The variance of relative fluctuations accurately reflects the extent of localization, even in the presence of absorption. Using this approach, we demonstrate photon localization in both weakly and strongly scattering quasi-one-dimensional dielectric samples and in periodic metallic wire meshes containing metallic scatterers, while ruling it out in three-dimensional mixtures of aluminum spheres."

https://openalex.org/W2066835429,"In metazoa, assembly of spliceosomal U snRNPs requires nuclear export of U snRNA precursors. Export depends upon the RNA cap structure, nuclear cap-binding complex (CBC), the export receptor CRM1/Xpo1, and RanGTP. These components are however insufficient to support U snRNA export. We identify PHAX (phosphorylated adaptor for RNA export) as the additonal factor required for U snRNA export complex assembly in vitro. In vivo, PHAX is required for U snRNA export but not for CRM1-mediated export in general. PHAX is phosphorylated in the nucleus and then exported with RNA to the cytoplasm, where it is dephosphorylated. PHAX phosphorylation is essential for export complex assembly while its dephosphorylation causes export complex disassembly. The compartmentalized PHAX phosphorylation cycle can contribute to the directionality of export."

https://openalex.org/W1964121026,"Both regulated expression of the clock genes kaiA, kaiB, and kaiC and interactions among the Kai proteins are proposed to be important for circadian function in the cyanobacterium, Synechococcus sp. strain PCC 7942. We have identified the histidine kinase SasA as a KaiC-interacting protein. SasA contains a KaiB-like sensory domain, which appears sufficient for interaction with KaiC. Disruption of the sasA gene lowered kaiBC expression and dramatically reduced amplitude of the kai expression rhythms while shortening the period. Accordingly, sasA disruption attenuated circadian expression patterns of all tested genes, some of which became arrhythmic. Continuous sasA overexpression eliminated circadian rhythms, whereas temporal overexpression changed the phase of kaiBC expression rhythm. Thus, SasA is a close associate of the cyanobacterial clock that is necessary to sustain robust circadian rhythms."

https://openalex.org/W2039817351,"During yeast meiosis, a checkpoint prevents exit from pachytene in response to defects in meiotic recombination and chromosome synapsis. This pachytene checkpoint requires two meiotic chromosomal proteins, Red1 and Mek1; Mek1 is a kinase that phosphorylates Red1. In mutants that undergo checkpoint-mediated pachytene arrest, Mek1 is active and Red1 remains phosphorylated. Activation of Mek1 requires the initiation of meiotic recombination and certain DNA damage checkpoint proteins. Mek1 kinase activity and checkpoint-induced pachytene arrest are counteracted by protein phosphatase type 1 (Glc7). Glc7 coimmunoprecipitates with Red1, colocalizes with Red1 on chromosomes, and dephosphorylates Red1 in vitro. We speculate that phosphorylated Red1 prevents exit from pachytene and that completion of meiotic recombination triggers Glc7-dependent dephosphorylation of Red1."

https://openalex.org/W2009620135,"The photoreceptor cGMP phosphodiesterase (PDE6) plays a key role in vertebrate vision, but its enzymatic mechanism and the roles of metal ion co-factors have yet to be determined. We have determined the amount of endogenous Zn2+ in rod PDE6 and established a requirement for tightly bound Zn2+ in catalysis. Purified PDE6 contained 3–4-g atoms of zinc/mole, consistent with an initial content of two tightly bound Zn2+/catalytic subunit. PDE with only tightly bound Zn2+ and no free metal ions was inactive, but activity was fully restored by Mg2+, Mn2+, Co2+, or Zn2+. Mn2+, Co2+, and Zn2+ also induced aggregation and inactivation at higher concentrations and longer times. Removal of 93% of the tightly bound Zn2+ by treatment with dipicolinic acid and EDTA at pH 6.0 resulted in almost complete loss of activity in the presence of Mg2+. This activity loss was blocked almost completely by Zn2+, less potently by Co2+ and almost not at all by Mg2+, Mn2+, or Cu2+. The lost activity was restored by the addition of Zn2+, but Co2+ restored only 13% as much activity, and other metals even less. Thus tightly bound Zn2+ is required for catalysis but could also play a role in stabilizing the structure of PDE6, whereas distinct sites where Zn2+ is rapidly exchanged are likely occupied by Mg2+ under physiological conditions.

Dickey B.F. Birnbaumer L. GTPases in Biology II. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1993: 213-223Google Scholar). They are responsible for rapid hydrolysis of cGMP in response to light activation of rhodopsin or cone pigment G protein-coupled receptors. This rapid reduction in cGMP concentration is the critical biochemical event for the electrical response of rod and cone photoreceptors to light, because it leads to closure of plasma membrane cGMP-gated channels. Similar PDE-mediated transduction cascades may operate in other neurons as well, for example, some taste receptors (2.Ruiz-Avila L. McLaughlin S.K. Wildman D. McKinnon P.J. Robichon A. Spickofsky N. Margolskee R.F. Nature. 1995; 376: 80-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar) and depolarizing photoreceptors in lizards (3.Xiong W.H. Solessio E.C. Yau K.W. Nat. Neurosci. 1998; 1: 359-365Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). PDE isolated from low salt extracts of retinal rod outer segments contains two large catalytic subunits, α and β (4.Baehr W. Devlin M.J. Applebury M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 11699-11707Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar) as well as smaller inhibitory γ subunits in what appears to be an αβγγ stoichiometry (5.Deterre P. Bigay J. Forquet F. Robert M. Chabre M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 2424-2428Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). The catalytic subunits contain regions of amino acid sequence that constitute catalytic domains and are conserved throughout a large superfamily of cyclic nucleotide-specific phosphodiesterases, PDE1-PDE10 (6.Beavo J.A. Reifsnyder D.H. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1990; 11: 150-155Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (826) Google Scholar, 7.Beavo J.A. Conti M. Heaslip R.J. Mol.

A. 1999; 96: 7071-7076Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that PDE isozymes are Zn2+metalloenzymes (10.Francis S.H. Colbran J.L. McAllister-Lucas L.M. Corbin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22477-22480Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and a catalytic role for Zn2+ in phosphodiester hydrolysis is plausible, as it has already been observed for other enzymes catalyzing ester hydrolysis, including phosphate mono- and diesters (reviewed in Ref. 11.Vallee B.L. Auld D.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 220-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). However, the experimental evidence on the role of Zn2+ in PDE isozymes remains incomplete. A study of a cGMP binding cGMP-specific PDE (PDE5 (10.Francis S.H. Colbran J.L. McAllister-Lucas L.M. Corbin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22477-22480Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)) reported inhibition by EDTA or 1,10-phenanthroline, partial restoration of activity by Zn2+, and Zn2+ binding sites of moderate affinity (K d ∼0.6 μm). Zn2+ was found in PDE solutions by atomic absorption analysis, but the samples analyzed had been treated with high concentrations of exogenous Zn2+. Another study of a cGMP-inhibited PDE (PDE3 (12.Omburo G.A. Brickus T. Ghazaleh F.A. Colman R.W. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 323: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar)) reported that 1,10-phenanthroline inhibited PDE, whereas nonchelating isomers did not, but only inhibitory effects of Zn2+ on PDE activity were found, as reported previously (13.Pillai R. Staub S.F. Colicelli J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30676-30681Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). More recently, substitution of serine for some histidine residues proposed to act as ligands for catalytic Zn2+ (from one of two His-Xaa3-His-Xaa24–26-Glu motifs highly conserved throughout the PDE superfamily (10.Francis S.H. Colbran J.L. McAllister-Lucas L.M. Corbin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22477-22480Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)) was found to abolish catalytic activity in PDE4A (14.Omburo G.A. Jacobitz S. Torphy T.J. Colman R.W. Cell. Signalling. 1998; 10: 491-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), and Zn2+ was found to have both activating and inhibiting activities toward recombinant PDE4A (15.Percival M.D. Yeh B. Falgueyret J.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 241: 175-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). In two studies (10.Francis S.H. Colbran J.L. McAllister-Lucas L.M. Corbin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22477-22480Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15.Percival M.D. Yeh B. Falgueyret J.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 241: 175-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), 65Zn2+ was found to bind PDE4A and PDE5, but in neither case did the concentration dependence of binding correlate well with the concentration dependence of activation. Taken together these previous results suggest that PDE isozymes in general have more than one class of Zn2+binding sites, which can either activate or inhibit catalytic activity. In no case, however, has it been demonstrated that any PDE loses catalytic activity when Zn2+ bound in vivo is removed but Mg2+ is present and then regains activity when Zn2+ is replaced. Rod PDE activity has a well established requirement for micromolar Mg2+ (16.Pannbacker R.G. Fleischman D.E. Reed D.W. Science. 1972; 175: 757-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). A study of the Mg2+ requirement (17.Srivastava D. Fox D.A. Hurwitz R.L. Biochem. J. 1995; 308: 653-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) revealed effects of [Mg2+] on apparentK m for cGMP and of [cGMP] on the dependence of activity on [Mg2+], consistent with sequential but random binding of Mg2+ and cGMP to form a competent substrate complex at the active site(s). The apparent presence of two inhibitory subunits and two catalytic subunits in each heterotetrameric holoenzyme complex suggests that there may be two active sites for cGMP hydrolysis, but it is not clear whether both are functional or whether there are any interactions between them. Noncatalytic sites for cGMP have been identified for both rod and cone PDE isozymes. The affinity of cGMP for these noncatalytic sites is much higher than the apparent affinity of cGMP for the active site, and cGMP dissociation from the mammalian rod isozyme is very slow (18.Gillespie P.G. Beavo J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 4311-4315Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 19.Mou H. Grazio III, H.J. Cook T.A. Beavo J.A. Cote R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18813-18820Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Extrinsic metals do not appear necessary for binding to the noncatalytic sites; cGMP binding to frog rod PDE (20.Yamazaki A. Sen I. Bitensky M.W. Casnellie J.E. Greengard P. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 11619-11624Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was observed without added metals and with EGTA, whereas bovine cone PDE bound cGMP with high affinity in the presence of 10 mm EDTA (18.Gillespie P.G. Beavo J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 4311-4315Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The investigations described here were undertaken to determine whether the photoreceptor PDE is a Zn2+ metalloenzyme and also to try to resolve some of the confusing issues concerning the role of Zn2+ in the general class of cyclic nucleotide-specific PDEs. They have revealed that each PDE molecule contains close to four tightly bound and very slowly dissociating Zn2+ ions and that at least some of these tightly bound Zn2+ ions are essential for catalysis. They also reveal the presence of additional sites where Zn2+ affects function; these may not be of physiological significance because of their low affinity, but they introduce considerable confusion into experiments addressing the role of Zn2+ in PDE. These sites include the one(s) at which Mg2+ is normally thought to act but at which Zn2+ and other metal ions can substitute at micromolar concentrations and lower affinity inhibitory sites, where Zn2+ destroys activity and induces aggregation. PDE was purified by hydroxylapatite chromatography from hypotonic extracts of bovine retinal rod outer segments as described (21.Malinski J.A. Wensel T.G. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 9502-9512Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), except that some extractions were from unbleached membranes. Additional purification was achieved by ion exchange high pressure liquid chromatography using a Waters Protein Pak 5PW-DEAE column and a linear gradient of 10–500 mm NaCl in a buffer containing 10 mm MOPS (pH 7.4), 5 mmMgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol. Protein concentrations were routinely determined by dye binding (22.Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217370) Google Scholar), using bovine serum albumin as the standard, and correcting the resulting values by dividing by the factor 1.2 (23.Gillespie P.G. Beavo J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 8133-8141Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Concentrations determined in this way agreed well with those determined by amino acid analysis. For quantitation of PDE in some samples analyzed for zinc content, amino acid analysis using 6-aminoquinolyl-N-hydroxysuccinimidyl carbamate pre-column derivatization (24.Strydom D.J. Cohen S.A. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 222: 19-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) was used, and in others, concentrations were verified by UV absorbance, using a calculated extinction coefficient of ε280 nm of 211,510m−1 cm−1 (25.Melia T.J. Malinski J.A. He F. Wensel T.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3535-3542Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Metal-free solutions were made by dissolving dry reagents of the highest purity commercially available in water purified to 18 megohms of resistance with a Milli-Q reverse osmosis system. Because these solutions were routinely found to contain readily detectable levels of contaminating metal ions, they were further purified by passing them through columns of Chelex-100 resin that had previously been washed with the buffer to be purified. Because Chelex-100 is not a sufficiently strong chelator to remove contaminating metal ions from chelators like Fura-2, solutions of Fura-2 were passed through the “calcium sponge” resin described previously (26.Meyer T. Wensel T.G. Stryer L. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 32-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar); this material is very similar to the resin formerly available from Molecular Probes under the name “polymetal ion sponge®.” A closed loop system was used to recirculate the Fura-2 solutions multiple times through the column to remove metal leached from pump tubing, plastic containers, etc. Metal-free solutions were stored in plastic containers that had been extensively washed with Mill-Q water and handled only with extensively washed plastic labware. Metal ions were added to metal-free buffers as small volumes of stock solutions containing the metal ion and citric acid in a 2:1 (M2+:citrate) ratio. These were prepared by dilution of stocks prepared with 10 mmM2+ (as the dichloride salt for Mg2+, Zn2+, Cu2+, and Mn2+ and as the diacetate salt for Co2+), and 5 mm dipotassium citrate (pH 5.0–5.5). Zn2+ and other metal ions were routinely detected by their effects on the excitation spectra of Fura-2 (27.Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 28.Simons T.J. Neurotoxicology. 1993; 14: 77-85PubMed Google Scholar). Typically 1–2 ml of Fura-2 at a final concentration of 0.5–2.6 μm was monitored in an acrylic cuvette using either an instrument described previously (29.Ramdas L. Disher R.M. Wensel T.G. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 11637-11645Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) or an ISS PC1 photon counting spectrofluorimeter. Titrations of metal-free Fura-2 with standard Zn2+ solutions were used to standardize the assay, which displayed a linear response in the range of 100–1000 nm total Zn2+. Buffers were tested for metal ion contamination by adding them to Fura-2 in a 1:1 (v/v) ratio and measuring the excitation spectrum with emission detected at 485 nm. Estimations of free [Zn2+] were calculated using aK d for Zn2+-Fura-2 of 3 nm(27.Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 30.Atar D. Backx P.H. Appel M.M. Gao W.D. Marban E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2473-2477Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). For estimating free Zn2+ in dipicolinic acid (DPA)-buffered samples, intensity at 346 nm excitation was measured as a function of added ZnCl2 with 10 μm DPA and 1 μm Fura-2. The signal was plotted as the raw metal-induced intensity increase (raw intensity minus the intensity measured in the presence of saturating EDTA) divided by the maximum intensity change induced by 10 μmtotal Zn2+. PDE solutions, stored at −20 °C in 40% (v/v) glycerol, were diluted to 2.0 ml (1.2 mg/ml) with metal-free pH assay buffer (see below) and concentrated to 400 μl in a Centricon 30 ultrafiltration device. The flow-through from the concentrator was saved for fluorescence assays, and the concentrated protein was again diluted in metal-free pH assay buffer. This process was continued until no further reduction in metal ion concentration was detected in the flow-through samples (typically 10–16 cycles, Fig. 1 A). PDE prepared this way is referred to here as mfPDE. PDE treated the same way after activation by limited trypsin digestion to remove the inhibitory PDEγ subunit followed by the addition of soybean trypsin inhibitor as described (21.Malinski J.A. Wensel T.G. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 9502-9512Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) is termed mftPDE. The procedure for removal of Zn2+ from adenosine deaminase (31.Cooper B.F. Sideraki V. Wilson D.K. Dominguez D.Y. Clark S.W. Quiocho F.A. Rudolph F.B. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 1031-1037Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) was used with modifications. Because exposure to buffers of pH below 6 was found to inactivate PDE irreversibly, a pH 6.0 buffer was used containing MES (25 mm), NaCl (50 mm), DPA (20 mm), and EDTA (10 mm). For experiments described in Fig. 5, PDE concentration at its most dilute was 0.01–0.02 mg/ml, whereas for those described in Table I and Fig. 6, the concentration at greatest dilution in the centricons was 0.2 mg/ml. The combination of DPA and EDTA was much more effective than treatment with EDTA alone. PDE was repeatedly diluted and reconcentrated ∼13-fold in a Centricon-30, until its trypsin inducible activity, assayed at pH 8.0 in the presence of 2 mmMgCl2, was reduced to less than 10% of its initial value (7–24 cycles depending on protein concentration). It was then washed as described above for mfPDE using pH 7.6 buffer (150 mmNaCl, 20 mm MOPS, metal-free), in parallel with a control (no chelator treatment) PDE sample, until the flow-through from both showed no further change in metal ion content (typically 14 cycles of 13-fold dilution). PDE prepared this way is referred to as zfPDE. In metal protection experiments, metal ions were present at the indicated total concentrations (typically 20 mm) during chelator treatment. Fura-2 measurements indicated that 20 mm total Zn2+ in the DPA/EDTA solution yielded an excitation spectrum intermediate between that of metal-free and Zn2+-saturated Fura-2, implying that free [Zn2+] under these conditions was on the order of itsK d for Fura-2 (3 nm).Table IActivity and zinc content of washed PDEpHChelatorsLog10dil. aTotal dilution of the original buffer by repeated concentration and redilution with metal-free buffers.Days bTotal days of treatment with metal-free buffers at 4 °C.Zn/PDE cDetermined by atomic absorption spectrophotometry.Specific Activity Mg2+ dAssayed in the presence of at least 1 mm free Mg2+.Specific Activity Mg2+b & Zn2+ cDetermined by atomic absorption spectrophotometry.8.0None4.623.62381 s−1n.d.8.0None6.333.31971 s−1n.d.7.6None15.641.49959 s−1n.d.6.0DPA/EDTA7.81n.d. fn.d., not determined.142 s−1n.d.6.0DPA/EDTA10.02n.d.142 s−1n.d.6.0DPA/EDTA20.04n.d.88 s−1n.d.6.0DPA/EDTA24.76n.d.26 s−1279 s−16.0 g6 days, DPA/EDTA, pH 6.0, 5 × 1024-fold dilution, then 4 days, no chelator, pH 7.6 (4 × 1015-fold dilution).DPA/EDTA40.3100.1369.8 s−1187 s−1a Following treatment, incubated with 20 mm Zn2+, 20 mm DPA, 10 mm EDTA, then assayed with Mg2+.a Total dilution of the original buffer by repeated concentration and redilution with metal-free buffers.b Total days of treatment with metal-free buffers at 4 °C.c Determined by atomic absorption spectrophotometry.d Assayed in the presence of at least 1 mm free Mg2+.f n.d., not determined.g 6 days, DPA/EDTA, pH 6.0, 5 × 1024-fold dilution, then 4 days, no chelator, pH 7.6 (4 × 1015-fold dilution).

PDE samples from which adventitious metal ions had been removed, as well as the final flow-through solution from ultrafiltration, were analyzed by atomic absorption spectrometry at the Center for Biochemical and Biophysical Sciences and Medicine at Harvard Medical School. Analyses were carried out at 213.9 nm in duplicate on multiple dilutions using a Perkin-Elmer model 2280 flame atomic absorption spectrophotometer or a Perkin-Elmer 4100 ZL instrument equipped with a transverse heated graphite furnace, Zeeman background correction, and an AS-70 autosampling device. Protein concentration was determined by amino acid analysis (24.Strydom D.J. Cohen S.A. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 222: 19-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) or by UV absorption spectrophotometry, as described above. PDE catalytic activity was monitored using the pH recording method (32.Liebman P.A. Evanczuk A.T. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 81: 532-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) as described previously (21.Malinski J.A. Wensel T.G. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 9502-9512Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) using PDE concentrations of 15–20 nm, initial cGMP concentration of 2.0 mm, and initial pH 8.0 at 23 °C. The extent of cGMP hydrolysis was monitored continuously, and only hydrolysis rates obtained at cGMP concentrations above 400 μm (∼10 × K m (1.Wensel T.G. Dickey B.F. Birnbaumer L. GTPases in Biology II. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1993: 213-223Google Scholar)) were used; when necessary additional cGMP was added at the end of reaction time courses to ensure that substrate was not limiting. In all cases PDE was activated by treating with trypsin (before or after various treatments to remove or add metal ions) to remove the inhibitory PDEγ subunits. No effects of metal ions on trypsin susceptibility were detected, nor did we observe any effects of trypsin treatment on sensitivity to metal ions or chelators. For assessing the role of divalent metal ions, metal-free pH assay buffer (20 mm MOPS, 150 mm KCl, adjusted to pH 8.0 with KOH) was prepared without the addition of MgCl2and passed through Chelex-100 resin. Alternatively, standard pH assay buffer was prepared with the same composition except for the inclusion of 2 mm MgCl2. To minimize interference by contaminating heavy metals in assays of Mg2+ effects on activity, the standard (MgCl2-containing) pH assay buffer was supplemented with either EDTA (e.g. 0.1 mmEDTA) or TPEN. Whereas removal of all free metal ions greatly reduced PDE activity, it did not completely abolish it, even when high concentrations of EDTA or TPEN were used. When cGMP (metal-free) was first added to PDE in the absence of free metal ions, there was a burst of activity, followed by a rapid decline to a plateau level of activity that was typically 5–10% of the maximum activity observed with saturating Mg2+. Activities reported here were all measured after this plateau level of activity was reached, i.e. at least 2 min after cGMP was added to PDE in metal-free buffer. The basis for the initial burst of activity is currently being investigated; preliminary results are consistent with some metal ion(s) bound initially being released from PDE by cGMP addition. Effects of prolonged incubation with TPEN were studied by incubating mftPDE on ice with 10 μm TPEN, 10 μm TPEN plus 10 μm Zn2+ (added as Zn2+/citrate solution), or a control solution containing the same trace of ethanol (0.01%) as the TPEN-containing samples. At various times, aliquots of PDE were removed and assayed in metal-free pH assay buffer supplemented with Mg2+ (2.0 mm) and TPEN (10 μm). Two independent preparations of PDE were purified and rendered free of adventitious metals. The results from analyses by graphite furnace atomic absorption (with protein quantification by amino acid analysis) revealed 3.3 (± 0.3) g atoms of Zn2+/mole of PDE in one preparation and 3.6 (± 0.3) g/mole in the other (Fig.1). The buffer controls (flow-through samples from the Centricon filters) contained in one case too little Zn2+ to be detected (<50 nm or <0.002 g atoms of adventitious Zn2+/g of PDE-bound Zn2+) and in the other case, 122 nm Zn2+ (0.018 g atoms of adventitious Zn2+/g of PDE-bound Zn2+). Because these PDE samples had been extensively washed with metal-free buffers for many hours, these sites are very likely of high affinity or, at least, release bound Zn2+ very slowly. Because there are two catalytic subunits with highly conserved sequences, it seems likely that there are an even number of high affinity sites,i.e. four, and that the stoichiometry of 3.3–3.6 represents partial occupancy of one (or more) site as a result of the extensive washing. If it assumed that the solutions analyzed had reached equilibrium and that the total number of high affinity sites is four, then single site K d values estimated from the analyses would be <10.6 nm for the first preparation and 13.6 nm for the second. Because these sites exchange metal ions very slowly and no exogenous Zn2+ had been added at any stage of PDE preparation from bovine retinas, it is almost certain that the Zn2+ ions we detected were bound to PDE in vivo. Disc membranes from bovine rod outer segments have been reported to contain 0.15 g atom of Zn2+/mole rhodopsin, corresponding to about 15 g atom of Zn2+/mole of PDE, based on particle induced x-ray emission analysis (33.McCormick L.D. Biophys. J. 1985; 47: 381-385Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). When PDE from which adventitious Zn2+ had been removed (mfPDE, the same sample of holoPDE used for atomic absorption analysis, containing <50 nm free Zn2+ before >1000-fold dilution for the assays) was assayed in the presence of 2 mmMg2+ and 0.1 mm EDTA, the specific activity observed with saturating substrate (2 mm cGMP) was 2381 moles of cGMP hydrolyzed/mole of PDE/second after trypsin treatment, in reasonable agreement with typical values observed for rod PDE (reviewed in Ref. 1.Wensel T.G. Dickey B.F. Birnbaumer L. GTPases in Biology II. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1993: 213-223Google Scholar), although somewhat lower than maximum values occasionally observed of ∼7000 mol of cGMP-PDE−1 s−1(18.Gillespie P.G. Beavo J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 4311-4315Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). 2J. A. Malinksi and T. G. Wensel, unpublished observations. The addition of Zn2+ did not significantly increase the activity of PDE after free metal ions had been removed and Mg2+ added, nor did the chelator TPEN significantly reduce the activity. Fig.2 shows results from PDE freed of adventitious metals after trypsinization (mftPDE). Again, neither low concentrations of Zn2+ nor TPEN had much effect on activity, as long as Mg2+ was present and the Zn2+ concentration was not so high as to inhibit PDE (see below). Thus we can conclude with certainty that free Zn2+(as opposed to that tightly bound to PDE) is not required for robust PDE activity. When mftPDE was assayed without added Mg2+, its activity was very low (Figs. 2 and3 A), as previously observed (16.Pannbacker R.G. Fleischman D.E. Reed D.W. Science. 1972; 175: 757-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 17.Srivastava D. Fox D.A. Hurwitz R.L. Biochem. J. 1995; 308: 653-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 34.Chader G. Fletcher R. Johnson M. Bensinger R. Exp. Eye Res. 1974; 18: 509-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 35.Cook N.J. Nullans G. Virmaux N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 883: 63-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). The addition of Zn2+ to PDE in the absence of added Mg2+ increased the activity (Figs. 2 and3 A). The activity observed after Zn2+ addition varied with time and was highest immediately after Zn2+ was added, so the values observed immediately after Zn2+addition are plotted in Figs. 2 and 3. The addition of TPEN prior to Zn2+ addition prevented the activity enhancement by Zn2+ (Fig. 2). PDE activity was also stimulated by Co2+ or Mn2+ (Fig. 3 A). The approximate concentrations (as total added metal ion) for half-maximal activity were 0.2 μm Zn2+, 2.2 μm Co2+, 7 μm Mn2+, 21 μm Mg2+. At higher concentrations (5 μm), especially at longer incubation times, Zn2+ exhibited an inhibitory effect (Figs.3 B and 4, A and B). The kinetics of inhibition are much slower than activation. Fig.4 A shows the slow loss of activity observed when Zn2+ is added in the presence of saturating Mg2+. Similar slow inhibition is observed in the absence of Mg2+ but is revealed as a biphasic activity response (Fig. 4 B). Thus, depending on how much Zn2+ is added and how long after addition activity is assayed, Zn2+ can appear to have a stimulatory effect, an inhibitory effect, or no effect at all on PDE activity. This complex behavior may help to explain some of the differences observed with different PDE isozymes in different laboratories. Although we did not characterize in detail the concentration dependence of the inhibition kinetics, we did observe that inhibition occurs faster with increasing Zn2+ concentrations. An interesting feature of the inhibition by Zn2+ is that it is readily prevented by chelating agents (either EDTA or TPEN), but once it occurs, the simple addition of chelating agents does not restore activity, even in the presence of sufficient Mg2+ for full activity. At high protein concentrations, visible precipitates were observed to form in the presence of Zn2+, suggesting that aggregation may account for all or part of the inhibition. In contrast to the very slow exchange kinetics observed at the high affinity sites and at the inhibitory sites, Zn2+ ions at the Mg2+ site undergo fairly rapid exchange. The initial activation phase seen in Fig. 4 B shows that binding of Zn2+ to this site is rapid (seconds), and the fairly rapid inhibition observed when TPEN was added to Zn2+-activated PDE (Fig. 4 C) indicates that dissociation from this site is fairly rapid (tens of seconds) as well. The Zn2+ chelating agent 1,10-phenanthroline is commonly used to determine the effects of removing free Zn2+ on enzyme activities. We observed inhibition of PDE by 1,10-phenanthroline. However, we found that two nonchelating phenanthroline isomers (1,7 and 4,7) inhibited PDE with comparable, and even slightly higher, potency. Coupled with the failure of TPEN to inhibit PDE when Mg2+ was present, these results indicate that phenanthrolines inhibit PDE by a mechanism not involving Zn2+ chelation. Similar results were observed with yeast PDE (36.Londesborough J. Suoranta K. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 2966-2972Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As discussed above, mild treatment with metal-free buffers did not efficiently remove the endogenous Zn2+ that is tightly bound, and chelating agents did not reduce PDE activity significantly when Mg2+ was present. Even prolonged incubation (24 h) of mftPDE with the Zn2+chelating agent TPEN (10 μm) did not reduce PDE activity substantially as compared with control samples incubated without TPEN or with TPEN and excess Zn2+, when PDE was assayed in the presence of Mg2+ (data not shown). TPEN has a very high affinity for Zn2+, with a reported K a = 1015.58m−1 (37.Arslan P. Di Virgilio F. Beltrame M. Tsien R.Y. Pozzan T. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 2719-2727Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whereas its affinity for Mg2+ is negligible with K a= 101.7m−1. Thus, any catalytically essential Zn2+ must not have dissociated from PDE on a 24-h time scale. In contrast, TPEN rapidly abolished the action of Zn2+ at the catalytically essential divalent cation binding sites usually occupied by Mg2+ in our assays (Figs. 2 and 4 C). A previous study of Zn2+ bound to adenosine deaminase (31.Cooper B.F. Sideraki V. Wilson D.K. Dominguez D.Y. Clark S.W. Quiocho F.A. Rudolph F.B. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 1031-1037Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) reported that low pH and use of a combination of dipicolinic acid and EDTA were effective in removing very tightly bound Zn2+. We used this procedure on PDE6 and found that prolonged treatment lead to loss of activity (Fig. 5 and TableI) in zfPDE. Some activity was lost just from the prolonged treatment at pH 6.0, even without chelator, but the loss was much greater in the presence of EDTA and was greatest when both DPA and EDTA were used. The chelator-dependent loss of activity was prevented by including Zn2+ in the low pH chelator solution (Fig. 5). The optimal concentration (total) of Zn2+ for preventing the loss was in a very narrow range centered on 20 mm (Fig. 5 B), the concentration at which nearly every Zn2+ is expected to be in a Zn-EDTA (K a = 1016.4m−1) or Zn-(DPA)2(K1 = 106.4m−1 and K2 = 105.5m−1) complex, but at which very little free chelator would be present (38.Auld D.S. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 158: 110-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Measurements with Fura-2 indicate that under these conditions, free [Zn2+] is on the order of the Fura-2 K d, ∼3 nm (1.5–3.5 nm using either ratiometric or single wavelength methods (27.Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar)). The simplest explanation for the biphasic character of the concentration dependence is that at lower Zn2+ concentrations the excess free chelator was still able to remove Zn2+ from PDE, and at higher concentrations, Zn2+ was able to act at the inhibitory sites discussed above. Other metal ions were much less effective at preventing the loss of activity. Co2+ was the most effective of these (Fig.5 B, inset), whereas Mn2+, Mg2+, and Cu2+ provided almost no protection. Fura-2 assays confirmed that over the concentration range tested sufficient Co2+ and Mn2+ were available to approach saturation of 1 μm Fura-2. Similar results were observed when activity was restored after washing by adding back metal ions to zfPDE. Zn2+ was most effective in restoring activity, whereas Co2+ was much less effective, and other metal ions were almost without effect (Fig.5 C). Again, the Zn2+ effect was biphasic, because of the inhibitory sites, but at the peak, nearly complete activity was restored. Thus, it seems likely that Zn2+originally bound to the enzyme is essential for catalytic activity, but the enzyme still has some catalytic activity if Co2+ is substituted for Zn2+. As shown in Table I, the DPA treatment that inactivated PDE was indeed effective in removing tightly bound Zn2+. Comparison of activity levels over a range of treatments of increasing stringency for metal removal as well as Zn2+ content for those samples assayed by atomic absorption (Table I and Fig.6) reveals a strong correlation between Zn2+ removal and loss of activity. As can be seen from the last column of Table I, in some cases Zn2+ only partially restored activity to the most stringently treated PDE, suggesting that some irreversible structural changes may have accompanied Zn2+ removal. A surprising feature of the results shown in Fig. 5 C is the concentration range (tens of micromolar) for Zn2+ required for maximal restoration of activity to zfPDE. Because it seemed likely that some chelators might be contaminating the preparation, we washed the PDE even more extensively with metal-free buffers and used DPA to buffer free Zn2+. The Zn2+ concentrations required were then much lower (Fig. 5 C, inset), and significant activation of zfPDE was observed at about the same total Zn2+ as that giving half-maximal saturation of the Fura-2 signal (K d ∼3 nm; note that at higher Zn2+ where the Fura-2 signal begins to saturate, reliable estimates of free Zn2+ cannot be obtained by this technique). The loss of activity upon removal of Zn2+, its selective prevention by Zn2+, and its selective restoration by Zn2+ represent strong evidence for an essential role for tightly bound Zn2+ in PDE catalytic activity. Although Zn2+ is clearly essential for catalysis, it is not possible from our data to conclude that it plays a direct role in catalysis (e.g. by activating water) or that it does not play a structural role. Very high affinity binding is consistent with a structural as well as catalytic role, as loss of such a high affinity ligand must necessarily be accompanied by a free energy increase for the metal-free state. Further studies of PDE structural integrity and thermal stability as a function of metal ion content, now possible due to the determination of conditions for Zn2+ removal, should allow the structural importance of Zn2+ and the Zn2+ binding residues to be tested.

SeveralO-GlcNAc-containing proteins such as nucleoporins as well as nonglycosylated proteins like importin β were isolated (9.Kikuchi N. Gohshi T. Kawahire S. Tachibana T. Yoneda Y. Isobe T. Lim C.R.

RuvB is a prokaryotic DNA helicase, and its helicase activity and DNA binding affinity are enhanced by interaction with RuvA (11.Shinagawa H. Iwasaki H. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 107-111Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 12.West S.C. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1997; 31: 213-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). These two factors form a large motor protein complex to promote branch migration at Holliday junctions at the late stages of homologous recombination. The p50/p47 and RuvB proteins share highly conserved Walker domains (A and B), indicative of proteins that bind nucleotide triphosphates (10.Gohshi T. Shimada M. Kawahire S. Imai N. Ichimura T.

Based on this, p50 and p47 were proposed to be the eukaryotic homologues of the RuvB DNA helicase. Indeed, p50 and p47 are present in a wide range of eukaryotes ranging from yeast to mammals, suggesting that this basic helicase activity may be conserved among the eukaryotes. In addition to recombination, transient unwinding of the DNA duplex is required in many cellular processes such as replication, transcription, and DNA repair. To accommodate these different aspects of DNA metabolism, cells typically encode multiple helicases, occasionally found in functionally distinct complexes. To date, at least 10 different DNA helicases have been identified in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (14.Li X. Yoder B.L. Burgers P.M.

Functional analyses of RAD3,SSL2, and DNA2 indicate that they are indeed required for fundamental cellular functions. Rad3p and Ssl2p are essential components of TFIIH, which is required for transcriptional initiation and transcription-coupled repair (15.Sung P. Prakash L. Weber S. Prakash S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

First, a 49-kDa protein isolated from rat liver nuclear extracts was found to interact with TATA-binding protein (TBP) (13.Kanemaki M. Makino Y. Yoshida T. Kishimoto T. Koga A. Yamamoto K.

The 49-kDa protein, referred to as TIP49a (TBP-interacting protein) was identical to p50 and was enriched in the testes. The recombinant TIP49a is an ATP-dependent DNA helicase (18.Makino Y. Kanemaki M. Kurokawa Y. Koji T. Tamura T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15329-15335Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Meanwhile, a human homologue of p50, RUVBL1, was shown to co-purify with RNAP II holoenzyme, and the yeast counterpart was reported to be essential for viability (19.Qiu X.B. Lin Y.L. Thome K.C. Pian P. Schlegel B.P. Weremowicz S. Parvin J.D. Dutta A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27786-27793Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Furthermore, in a search for proteins that interact with β-catenin, two novel human proteins, 52- and 44-kDa, were detected (20.Bauer A. Huber O. Kemler R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14787-14792Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). The 52-kDa protein corresponding to p50 (TIP49a, RUVBL1) was designated Pontin 52 and shown to bind to TBP directly. In addition, p50 was also isolated as NMP238, a ubiquitously occurring nuclear matrix protein (21.Holzmann K. Gerner C. Korosec T. Poltl A. Grimm R. Sauermann G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 252: 39-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). On the other hand, little has been described thus far for p47. In a very recent study, a new RuvB-like DNA helicase termed TIP49b was demonstrated to associate with TIP49a (22.Kanemaki M. Kurokawa Y. Matsu-ura T. Makino Y. Masani A. Okazaki K. Morishita T. Tamura T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22437-22444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The protein sequence between p47 (mouse) and TIP49b (rat) varies by only 2 residues. Although the above reports indicate that p50 interacts with TBP, RNAP II holoenzyme, or both, p50 and p47 may also provide helicase enzymatic activity in recombination events. The key question of what critical function(s) p50 provides in vivo that makes it essential for viability is not yet understood, but it is important to note that studies to date link p50 primarily to the machinery of gene transcription. Given the similarities shared by recombination, replication, and transcription events at the DNA helicase level, it is not surprising that p50 may participate in multiple cellular events. In this study, we undertook a genetic approach to study the in vivo role of Tih2p, the less well studied yeast homologue of p47. Similar to the yeast homologue of p50, TIH1(TIP49a homologue), TIH2(TIP49b homologue) is also an essential gene. Whereas the sequence homology of Tih2p to RuvB suggests a role in recombination and DNA repair, our results indicate that Tih2p is essential for proper cell cycle progression and for the selective transcription of a subset of genes. The participation of Tih2p in these functions may explain its requirement for viability. Yeast strains used in this paper are listed in Table I. All strains were grown in rich medium (YPD) or selective medium (synthetic complete, synthetic dextrose, synthetic galactose) supplemented with the appropriate nutrients. Genetic manipulation of yeast cells was performed as described previously (23.Kimata Y. Kohno K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13497-13501Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The pRS vector series was described previously (24.Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Details of primers used in this study are available on request. The TIH2 knockout plasmid, pDisTIH2, was constructed by PCR amplification of a pair of DNA fragments flanking the TIH2 ORF, creating appropriate restriction sites at each end, and by subsequent ligation of these fragments into pRS303. To replace the entire TIH2 ORF withHIS3, pDisTIH2 was linearized withBamHI and transformed into a diploid strain, CRDFY (FY background, Table I, FY strains are generous gifts from F. Winston, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA). Disruption was verified by Southern blotting. The TIH2 locus on anEcoRI-ClaI fragment was amplified by PCR of genomic DNA and ligated into pRS316 and pRS314 to obtain pRS316-TIH2 and pRS314-TIH2, respectively. To create pRS425-ADH1p-p47, the ORF of p47 was PCR-amplified from a pBluecript II SK(−) plasmid containing p47 (10.Gohshi T. Shimada M. Kawahire S. Imai N. Ichimura T. Omata S. Horigome T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1999; 125: 939-946Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) and subsequently ligated into HindIII/NotI-digested pRS425-ADH1p (25.Lim C.R. Kimata Y. Oka M. Nomaguchi K. Kohno K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1995; 118: 13-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Plasmid pRS425-ADH1p-p50 was created similarly except that p50 was PCR-amplified from the plasmid p50(3A-5) (9.Kikuchi N. Gohshi T. Kawahire S. Tachibana T. Yoneda Y. Isobe T. Lim C.R. Kohno K. Ichimura T. Omata S. Horigome T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1999; 125: 487-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). To create pRS314-ADH1p-S65TGFP-TIH2, TIH2 was amplified by PCR (ORF minus start codon) and ligated intoEcoRI/NotI-digested pRS314-ADH1p-S65TGFP-nucleoplasmin, constructed previously by ligating an XhoI/NotIADH1p-S65TGFP-nucleoplasmin fragment isolated from pAGN5 (26.Kimata Y. Lim C.R. Kiriyama T. Nara A. Hirata A. Kohno K. Cell Struct. Funct. 1999; 24: 197-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) into pRS314. To create K81R-TIH2, fusion PCR was performed (27.Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6771) Google Scholar). The final PCR product was digested withEcoRI/ClaI and ligated into pRS314 yielding pRS314-K81R-TIH2. Plasmid pRS426-GAL1p-K81R-TIH2 was created by PCR amplification of the ORF of K81R-TIH2 from pRS314-K81R-TIH2 and subsequent subcloning intoEcoRI/NotI-digested pRS426-GAL1p. Plasmid pRS426-GAL1p was created by amplification ofGAL1p (template: pYES2, InVitrogen) and subsequent subcloning into XhoI/HindIII-digested pRS426. Plasmid pRS426-GAL1p-TIH2 was constructed similarly as pRS426-GAL1p-K81R-TIH2, except that pRS316-TIH2 was used as the TIH2 ORF template in the PCR step. To express an N-terminally double hemagglutinin-tagged Tih2p fusion protein from its authentic promoter (pRS314-HA-TIH2), fusion PCR was performed (27.Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6771) Google Scholar). The final fusion PCR products were subcloned as anEcoRI/ClaI-digested fragment into pRS314. To tag ProtA to the N terminus of Tih1p, a fragment containingNOP1p-ProtA from pUN100-ProtA-NUP133 (28.Doye V. Wepf R. Hurt E.C. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 6062-6075Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar) was isolated as a SalI/EcoRI fragment and subcloned into pRS314 yielding pRS314-NOP1p-ProtA. A fragment containing TIH1 (ORF minus start codon) was PCR-amplified from genome DNA with the attachment ofEcoRI/NotI sites and subsequently inserted into pRS314-NOP1p-ProtA to obtain PRS314-NOP1p-ProtA-TIH1.Table IYeast strains usedFY78MATahis3Δ200FY24MATα trp1Δ63 leu2Δ1 ura3–52CRFY1MATα his3Δ200 leu2Δ1 ura3–52CRFY2MATa his3Δ200 trp1Δ63 ura3–52CRDFYMATa/α his3Δ200/his3Δ200 ura3–52/ura3–52 trp1Δ63/TRP1 leu2Δ1/LEU2CRPA1MATahis3Δ200 trp1Δ63 ura3–52 tih2Δ∷HIS3(pRS316-TIH2)CRPA2MATα his3Δ200 leu2Δ1 trp1Δ63 ura3–52 tih2Δ∷HIS3 (pRS316-TIH2)CRH3MATa his3Δ200 trp1Δ63 ura3–52 tih2Δ∷HIS3 (pRS314-TIH2,pRS426-Gal1p-TIH2)CRH4MATahis3Δ200 trp1Δ63 ura3–52 tih2Δ∷HIS3(pRS314-TIH2, pRS426-Gal1p)CRH6MATa his3Δ200 trp1Δ63 ura3–52 tih2Δ∷HIS3(pRS314-TIH2)CRH7MATa his3Δ200 trp1Δ63 ura3–52 tih2Δ∷HIS3 (pRS314-HA-TIH2)CRH8MATa his3Δ200 trp1Δ63 ura3–52 tih2Δ∷HIS3 (pRS314-tih2–160)CRH15MATa his3Δ200 trp1Δ63 ura3–52 tih2Δ∷HIS3(pRS314-TIH2,pRS426-Gal1p-K81R-TIH2)CRH25MATa his3Δ200 trp1Δ63 ura3–52 tih2Δ∷HIS3(pRS314-ADH1p-GFP-TIH2)CRH27MATa his3Δ200 trp1Δ63 ura3–52 tih2Δ∷HIS3(pRS314-HA-TIH2,pRS316-Nop1p-ProtA-TIH1)Z676MATα his3Δ200 leu2–3,112 ura3–52 rpbΔ187∷HIS3 (RY2522 (CEN, URA3, rpb1–1)) Open table in a new tab A DNA fragment (nucleotides −817 to 1701) of TIH2 (ORF ofTIH2 corresponds to nucleotides 1–1416) was randomly mutagenized by PCR, using a 1:5 ratio of dATP to the other dNTPs (29.Leung D.W. Chen E. Goeddel D.V. Technique (Phila.). 1989; 1: 11-15Google Scholar). The PCR product was digested with EcoRI and ClaI and subcloned into pRS314 to generate a pRS314-based TIH2mutant plasmid library. The mutant plasmid library was introduced into the parental strain CRPA1. Transformants were plated on 5-FOA at 23 °C to counterselect against the TIH2,URA3 plasmid. A total of ∼500 colonies were isolated and streaked on YPD. After 3–5 days of incubation at 23 °C, they were replica plated onto two YPD plates and incubated at either 23 or 37 °C. After 2–3 days of incubation at the respective temperatures, plates were compared, and strains that were able to grow at 23 °C but not 37 °C were isolated. Plasmids harboring the mutagenized TIH2 genes were recovered from these putative ts strains and re-introduced into the parental strain (CRPA1). Temperature sensitivity was reconfirmed by plasmid shuffling. The sequences of some of the mutant alleles were determined. Cells grown in YPD medium to the early exponential phase at 23 °C (A 600 ≤ 0.2), were harvested at the appropriate times after temperature shift by centrifugation, washed with medium, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C. Total RNA from cells was isolated by hot phenol extraction (30.$$$$$$ ref data missingGoogle Scholar). Northern blotting was performed as described (31.Apone L.M. Virbasius C.M. Reese J.C. Green M.R. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2368-2380Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Twelve μg of each RNA sample were subjected to electrophoresis in a 1.1% formaldehyde/agarose gel, followed by transfer to a nylon membrane (Hybond-N+, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). All probes used for hybridization were generated by PCR amplification using genomic DNA as template and labeled using a random primer labeling kit (TaKaRa). Blots were stripped for reprobing by boiling and cooling to room temperature in 0.1% SDS. For slot blot analysis, 2 μg of RNA from each sample were used. Experiments were performed essentially as described (32.Walker S.S. Shen W.C. Reese J.C. Apone L.M. Green M.R. Cell. 1997; 90: 607-614Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Protein extracts from yeast strains grown in YPD liquid culture prepared essentially as described (33.Kotani T. Miyake T. Tsukihashi Y. Hinnebusch A.G. Nakatani Y. Kawaichi M. Kokubo T. J. Biol.

Detection of the antibody signal was accomplished with the Amersham Pharmacia Biotech ECL Western detection kit. Extracts were prepared by pelleting 10 ml of cells (A 600 ∼0.5) cultured in synthetic complete, washing once with lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 5 mm EDTA), and resuspending again in 200 μl of lysis buffer supplemented by protease inhibitors. Composition of protease inhibitors was 1 mm phenylmethylsufonyl fluoride and 10 μg/ml each of pepstatin, leupeptin, and aprotinin. Glass beads (200 μl) were added, and cells were lysed by several cycles of vortexing for 30 s followed by a 1-min incubation on ice. Extracts were clarified by two consecutive centrifugations (14,000 ×g for 5 min). Extract protein concentration was determined using BCA protein assay (Pierce) and found to be typically 2–4 mg/ml. Extracts (170 μl) were preincubated in 4 volumes of immunoprecipitation buffer (1.25% Triton X-100, 180 mmNaCl, 6 mm EDTA, 60 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 6% skim milk) containing 5 μl of Sepharose for 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was collected, and 5 μl of immunoprecipitation buffer-pre-equilibrated IgG-Sepharose was added and incubated on a rotator for 1 h at 4 °C. Beads were then washed extensively with wash buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA), and 10 μl of SDS sampling buffer was added; the sample was boiled for 5 min and then loaded on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. To detect HA-Tih2p or ProtA-Tih1p, anti-HA 12CA5 monoclonal antibody or rabbit IgG was used, respectively. To label cells with [35S]methionine/cysteine (Express protein labeling mix; NEN Life Science Products) 5 × 107 exponentially grown cells in methionine/cysteine-free synthetic complete medium were resuspended in 1 ml of methionine/cysteine-free synthetic complete medium and labeled with 1 mCi of [35S]methionine/cysteine for 20 min at 30 °C. Cell extracts were prepared using glass beads. Immunoprecipitation was performed as described (34.Kolodziej P.A. Young R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 508-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar) using anti-HA 12CA5 monoclonal antibody as the first antibody. Extracts were fractionated using ammonium sulfate (0.4 g/ml) prior to immunoprecipitation. To determine the budding index, log phase cells growing at 23 °C in YPD medium were temperature-shifted to 37 °C, and aliquots were removed at the appropriate time points. These were sonicated briefly and fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (100 mm NaCl, 80 mmNa2HPO4, 20 mmNaH2PO4, pH 7.3), and the number of single, small budded and large budded cells were determined microscopically. 1 × 107 cells growing exponentially in YPD at 23 °C were temperature-shifted to 37 °C and harvested at various time intervals. They were fixed in 70% ethanol overnight at 4 °C and washed twice in 50 mmsodium citrate (pH 7.4). These fixed cells were resuspended in the same buffer (1 ml) containing 0.25 mg/ml RNase A and incubated for 1 h at 50 °C. One mg of proteinase K was added, and incubation was continued at 50 °C for another hour. Cells were washed once and resuspended in 1 ml of the same buffer plus 16 μg/ml propidium iodide. DNA content was measured using a fluorescence-activated cell sorting system (FACScan, Becton Dickinson). In our previous studies, two eukaryotic homologues of the bacterial RuvB DNA helicase, p50 and p47, were isolated. Searching through the S. cerevisiae Genome Data base (Stanford University), two ORFs designated as YDR190C and YPL235W were identified as the yeast homologues of p50 and p47, respectively. Sequence identities are as high as 70% between p50 and YDR190C and 69% between p47 and YPL235W (Fig.1 A). On the other hand, sequence identities between p50 and p47 and between YDR190C and YPL235W are only 43 and 40%, respectively. Therefore, we propose classifying these eukaryotic RuvB-like proteins into two subfamilies,i.e. the p50 and the p47 subfamily (Fig. 1 A). It was of great interest to us that different eukaryotes would encode two highly conserved subfamilies of RuvB-like proteins that are homologous to each other and of similar molecular size (50 and 51 kDa). To investigate the functions of these RuvB-like proteins, we undertook a genetic study of the less well studied p47 yeast homologue, YPL235W. For simplicity, we will refer to YDR190C (p50 homologue) asTIH1 for TIP49a homologue (see Introduction) and YPL235W as TIH2. Because TIH1 had been shown to be an essential gene (9.Kikuchi N. Gohshi T. Kawahire S. Tachibana T. Yoneda Y. Isobe T. Lim C.R. Kohno K. Ichimura T. Omata S. Horigome T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1999; 125: 487-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 19.Qiu X.B.

Chem. 1999; 274: 22437-22444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), we first asked if TIH2 is also required for viability. The TIH2 gene was disrupted as described under “Experimental Procedures.” A CEN/ARS plasmid containing the wild-type TIH2 gene (URA3, TIH2) was introduced into the TIH2/tih2::HIS3 diploid strain. One HIS3 URA3 progeny obtained from the tetrad analysis, designated CRPA1 (Table I), was transformed with either a pRS314-based plasmid (CEN/ARS) containing wild-type TIH2 (TRP1, TIH2) or a control vector (pRS314) and was counter selected on 5-FOA medium. Only transformants containing the (TRP1, TIH2) plasmid were able to grow on 5-FOA medium, indicating that TIH2 is indeed required for mitotic vegetative growth (Fig. 1 B). To determine if Tih2p could be functionally replaced by the highly conserved mammalian p47, we constructed a multicopy plasmid overexpressing p47 from a yeast constitutive promoter (ADH1p). We found out that neither p47 nor p50 was able to rescue the tih2 Δ disruptant, whereas a similar control vector overexpressing the yeast TIH2 gene did so as well as complementation with the endogenously expressed gene (Fig.1 B). Thus the yeast TIH2 gene cannot be complemented by p47, similar to the results obtained with p50, which was unable to replace the function of TIH1 in atih1Δ disruptant (19.Qiu X.B. Lin Y.L.

To probe the cellular location of Tih2p, a construct consisting of Tih2p with the green fluorescent protein fused to its N terminus (GFP-Tih2p) was inserted into an ADH1p expression vector. The parental null allele strain CRPA1 was transformed with this GFP-TIH2 fusion and tested for growth on 5-FOA medium. Transformants were found to grow normally, indicating that GFP-TIH2 was fully functional (Fig. 2 A). Observation using a fluorescent microscope showed that this fusion protein was localized primarily to the nucleus (Fig. 2 B), consistent with the fact that p47 was isolated from rat liver nuclear extract (10.Gohshi T. Shimada M. Kawahire S. Imai N. Ichimura T. Omata S. Horigome T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1999; 125: 939-946Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Faint GFP fluorescence was also detected in the cytosol, probably because of overexpression. The cytosolic fluorescence was not caused by GFP-Tih2p degradation, because GFP-Tih2p proteolysis was not observed (data not shown). Similar results were obtained with a yeast strain expressing a functional HA-tagged TIH2 (HA-Tih2p) under the control of its own promoter (data not shown). The only recognizable functional motifs in Tih2p are the so-called Walker A and B motifs, which are involved in ATP binding/hydrolysis and are the region of Tih2p most homologous to the prokaryotic helicase, RuvB (9.Kikuchi N. Gohshi T. Kawahire S. Tachibana T. Yoneda Y. Isobe T. Lim C.R. Kohno K. Ichimura T. Omata S. Horigome T. J. Biochem.

To investigate whether the helicase domain of Tih2p contributes to its essential physiological role, the invariant lysine at position 81 in the major GX4GKT nucleotide-binding loop was changed to arginine (K81R) by site-directed mutagenesis (Fig.3 A). A pRS314-based plasmid harboring the mutated gene K81R-TIH2(TRP1, K81R-TIH2) or wild-type TIH2(TRP1, TIH2) was introduced into the parental null allele strain CRPA1. When counter selected on 5-FOA medium, transformants harboring the plasmid (TRP1, K81R-TIH2) failed to grow at different temperatures (Fig.3 B, only plates incubated at 30 °C are shown). This indicated that K81R-TIH2 alone is unable to support the growth of tih2 Δ cells. Therefore, we concluded that the Walker A motif is essential for the function of Tih2p that contributes to cell viability. Furthermore, when K81R-TIH2 was overexpressed under the control of the inducible GAL1 promoter (GAL1p) in wild-type cells, it exerted a dominant negative effect. These cells were normal when grown on glucose, but growth was significantly retarded when grown on synthetic medium containing galactose as the sole carbon source (Fig. 3 C). This result implies that the function of Tih2p may require the formation of self-complexes or complexes with certain cellular components in vivo. The fact that p50 and p47 were each found in a large complex of similar size, 700 kDa, suggested that they might exist in the same complex (10.Gohshi T. Shimada M. Kawahire S. Imai N. Ichimura T. Omata S. Horigome T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1999; 125: 939-946Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The dominant negative effect of K81R-Tih2p we observed also suggested that complex formation may be important to Tih2p function. Therefore we examined if Tih2p interacts with any other components in vivo. Wild-typeTIH2 was modified with the hemagglutinin epitope"
https://openalex.org/W2061565807,"Previous studies have demonstrated that an increase in the activity of protein-tyrosine kinase (PTK) is involved in the down-regulation of the activity of apical small conductance K+ (SK) channels in the cortical collecting duct (CCD) from rats on a K+-deficient diet (1.Wang W.H. Lerea K.M. Chan M. Giebisch G. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: F165-F171Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We used the patch clamp technique to investigate the role of protein-tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) in the regulation of the activity of SK channels in the CCD from rats on a high K+ diet. Western blot analysis indicated that PTP-1D is expressed in the renal cortex. Application of 1 μm phenylarsine oxide (PAO) or 1 mmbenzylphosphonic acid, agents that inhibit PTP, reversibly reduced channel activity by 95%. Pretreatment of CCDs with PAO for 30 min decreased the mean NPo reversibly from control value 3.20 to 0.40. Addition of 1 μm herbimycin A, an inhibitor of PTK, had no significant effect on channel activity in the CCDs from rats on a high K+ diet. However, herbimycin A abolished the inhibitory effect of PAO, indicating that the effect of PAO is the result of interaction between PTK and PTP. Addition of brefeldin A, an agent that blocks protein trafficking from Golgi complex to the membrane, had no effect on channel activity. Moreover, application of colchicine, a microtubule inhibitor, or paclitaxel, a microtubule stabilizer, had no effect on channel activity. In contrast, PAO still reduced channel activity in the presence of brefeldin A, colchicine, or paclitaxel. Furthermore, the effect of PAO on channel activity was absent when the tubules were bathed in 16% sucrose-containing bath solution or treated with concanavalin A. We conclude that PTP is involved in the regulation of the activity of SK channels and that inhibition of PTP may facilitate the internalization of the SK channels.

Furthermore, the effect of PAO on channel activity was absent when the tubules were bathed in 16% sucrose-containing bath solution or treated with concanavalin A. We conclude that PTP is involved in the regulation of the activity of SK channels and that inhibition of PTP may facilitate the internalization of the SK channels. cortical collecting duct phenylarsine oxide protein-tyrosine kinase protein-tyrosine phosphatase small conductance K+ The CCD1 plays a key role in the regulation of K+ secretion. K+secretion occurs by a two-step process; K+ enters the cell across the basolateral membrane by Na-K-ATPase and exits the cell across the apical membrane through apical secretory K+channels (2.Giebisch G. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: F817-F833Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is generally believed that the SK channels provide the major pathway for K+ across the apical membrane (2.Giebisch G. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: F817-F833Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3.Wang W.H. Hebert S.C. Giebisch G. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1997; 59: 413-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 4.Frindt G.

Aldosterone and vasopressin play an important role in the regulation of K+ secretion (2.Giebisch G. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: F817-F833Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The effect of aldosterone on K+ secretion may be indirect and most likely results from an increase in an electrochemical driving force for K+across the apical membrane as well as from stimulation of Na-K-ATPase (3.Wang W.H. Hebert S.C. Giebisch G. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1997; 59: 413-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 7.Wang W. Schwab A. Giebisch G. Am. J.

In addition to aldosterone, dietary intake of K+regulates K+ secretion; high K+ intake increases whereas low K+ intake decreases urinary K+ secretion (9.Giebisch G. Wang W.H. Kidney Int. 1996; 49: 1624-1631Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The effect of the dietary K+intake on K+ secretion is achieved partially by changing the number of the apical SK channels (7.Wang W. Schwab A. Giebisch G. Am. J. Physiol. 1990; 259: F494-F502Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8.Palmer L.G. Antonian L. Frindt G. J. Gen. Physiol. 1994; 105: 693-710Crossref Scopus (157) Google Scholar). The effect of high K+ intake on the number of secretory K+channels is not mediated by aldosterone because the number of SK channels is not increased in rats infused with aldosterone or on a low sodium diet, a maneuver that increases aldosterone secretion (8.Palmer L.G. Antonian L. Frindt G. J. Gen. Physiol. 1994; 105: 693-710Crossref Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Thus, it is possible that an aldosterone-independent pathway mediates the effect of dietary intake of K+.We have previously demonstrated that the number of SK channels decreased in rats on a K+-deficient diet (1.Wang W.H. Lerea K.M. Chan M. Giebisch G. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: F165-F171Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Additionally, we have found that the expression and enzyme activity of c-Src increased in the kidney of animals on a K+-deficient diet. Moreover, inhibition of PTK increased the number of the SK channels in the CCD from rats on a K+-deficient diet. This suggests that an increase in PTK activity may be partially responsible for the down-regulation of the SK channels in the CCD from animals on a K+-deficient diet. Since tyrosine phosphorylation is determined by PTK and by PTP (10.Sun H. Tonks N.K. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 480-485Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar), it is conceivable that PTP should also be involved in the regulation of the number of the apical SK channels.In this study, we present novel results demonstrating that inhibiting PTP reduces the number of the apical SK channels in the CCD obtained from rats on a high K+ diet. The effect of inhibiting PTP on channel activity is the result of increasing the internalization of the SK channels from the apical membrane of the CCD.RESULTSWe used Western blot analysis to detect the expression of c-Src, PTP-1B, PTP-1C, and PTP-1D in the renal cortex obtained from rats on a normal chow and on a high K+ diet (7 days). Fig.1 is a representative Western blot showing the presence of c-Src (a) and PTP-1D (b) in the renal cortex. It is apparent that the expression of c-Src was significantly lower (51 ± 5% of the control, n = 5) in the renal cortex from rats on a high K+ diet than that on a normal diet. However, the expression level of PTP-1D in the renal cortex was not significantly different between the two groups. We failed to identify the expression of PTP-1B and PTP-1C in the renal cortex (data not shown).To explore the role of PTP in the regulation of apical SK channels in the CCD, we studied the effect of PAO, an inhibitor of PTP (11.Schmidt A. Rutledge S.J. Endo N. Opas E.E. Tanaka H. Wesolowski G. Leu C.T. Huang Z. Ramachandaran C. Rodan S.B. Rodan G.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

J. 1998; 333: 591-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), on the activity of SK channels in the tubules from rats on a high K+ diet. Fig. 2 is a representative channel recording showing the effect of PAO on channel activity in a cell-attached patch. Addition of 1 μm PAO reduced channel activity by 95 ± 8% (n = 30) within 10–15 min. The effect of PAO was reversible because removal of PAO restored the channel activity to the control level within 30 min. To exclude the possibility that PAO was a channel blocker, we examined the effect of PAO on channel activity in inside-out patches and found that PAO had no effect on SK channels in inside-out patches (data not shown). Moreover, the effect of PAO was mimicked by 1 mmbenzylphosphonic acid-(AM)2 (13.Pasquet J.M. Dachary-Prigent J. Nurden A.T. Biochem. J. 1998; 333: 591-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), another inhibitor of PTP. Addition of benzylphosphonic acid reduced the channel activity by 94 ± 8% (n = 5). This indicated that the effect of PAO was the result of inhibition of PTP. Fig.3 summarizes the results obtained from experiments in which the effect of 1 μm PAO, 1 mm benzylphosphonic acid-(AM)2 on the apical SK channels was investigated in the CCD from rats on a high K+diet. Inhibition of PTP reduced channel activity by 63 ± 6% and 95 ± 5% within 10 and 15 min, respectively (n = 35). In addition, we examined the NPo of SK channels per patch under control conditions and in the presence of PAO. The mean NPo of the SK channels was 3.2 ± 0.2 (n = 87) under control conditions in the CCD from rats on a high K+ diet. Pretreatment of the CCDs with 1 μm PAO for 30 min reduced the meanNPo to 0.4 ± 0.1 (n = 42) (Fig. 4). The meanNPo returned to 2.6 ± 0.2 (n = 32) 30 min after removal of PAO (Fig. 4). This further suggested that the effect of PAO is reversible. The PAO-induced decrease in NPo is most likely the result of reducing the number of the functional SK channels rather than decreasing the channel open probability because thePo of the SK channels was the same (control, 0.92, PAO, 0.92) (data not shown).Figure 2A representative channel recording showing the effect of 1 μm PAO on the activity of the apical SK channel in the CCD from a rat on a high K+ diet.

Thus, we investigated the effect of brefeldin A, an agent that blocks the protein trafficking from Golgi complex to the cell membrane (14.Chardin P. McCormick F. Cell. 1999; 97: 153-155Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). Brefeldin A has been shown to decrease the insertion of epithelial sodium channels expressed in oocytes (15.Shimkets R.A. Lifton R.P. Canessa C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25537-25541Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). However, addition of 5 μm brefeldin A failed to decrease channel activity in any 10 patches within 30 min (Fig.5 A). In contrast, addition of 1 μm PAO reduced the activity of the SK channels by 96 ± 7% (n = 7) in the same tubules in which brefeldin A had no effect on channel activity (Fig. 5, A andB). Therefore, it is unlikely that the effect of PAO resulted from inhibiting a brefeldin A-sensitive trafficking pathway. Since the insertion of SK channels may take place by an endoplasmic reticulum-independent and brefeldin A-insensitive recycling pathway, we extended our study to examine the effects of colchicine and Taxol, agents which inhibit and freeze microtubule, respectively. Fig.6 summarizes results from five experiments investigating the effect of 5 μm colchicine or 10 μm Taxol on the channel activity. It is apparent that neither colchicine nor Taxol had a significant effect on channel activity within 15–20 min. In contrast, PAO still reduced the channel activity by 94 ± 9% in the presence of colchicine and 95 ± 9% in the presence of Taxol.Figure 5A, the effect of brefeldin A (5 μm) and PAO (1 μm) + brefeldin A on channel activity.

We investigated the effect of PAO in the presence of 8% or 16% sucrose, which blocks the endocytosis of the cell membrane (16.Luttrell L.M. Daaka Y. Della-Rocca G.J. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31648-31656Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 17.Beaumont V. Hepworth M.B. Luty J.S. Kelly E. Henderson G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33174-33183Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Fig. 7 summarizes the results of experiments in which the effect of 1 μm PAO on the activity of the SK channels was examined in the presence of 8% and 16% sucrose, respectively. From inspection of Fig. 7, it is clear that the effect of PAO was significantly attenuated (70 ± 6% of the control, n = 7) in the presence of 8% sucrose-containing bath solution and completely abolished in the 16% sucrose-containing bath solution (95 ± 5% of the control value,n = 7). The notion that the PAO-induced decrease inNPo may be induced by increasing the internalization of the SK channels, is further supported by experiments in which the effect of PAO on channel activity was examined after the tubules were treated with concanavalin A, an agent that has been shown to block the endocytosis of receptors (16.Luttrell L.M.

However, the effect of PAO was abolished in the presence of concanavalin A (Fig. 8) and theNPo in the presence of PAO and concanavalin A was 96 ± 6% of the control value (n = 7).Figure 7The time course of the PAO effect on the SK channels in the normal bath solution (no sucrose) (filled circles), in the presence of 8% sucrose-containing bath solution (triangle), and in the presence of 16% of sucrose-containing bath solution (square).

Accordingly, the activity of the SK channels was diminished by a PTK-dependent pathway. We studied the effect of PAO after the CCDs were treated with 1 μm herbimycin A. We confirmed the previous finding that addition of herbimycin A had no significant effect on channel activity in the CCD from rats on a high K+ diet (1.Wang W.H. Lerea K.M. Chan M. Giebisch G. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: F165-F171Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, pretreatment of CCDs with herbimycin A significantly attenuated the effect of PAO. Fig.9 summarizes the results from eight experiments in which the effect of PAO was examined in the presence of herbimycin A. It is clear that blockade of PTK abolished the PAO-induced decrease in channel activity since PAO reduced the channel activity only by a modest 25 ± 3% (n = 10), a value that was significantly smaller than that in the absence of herbimycin A.Figure 9The effects of 1 μm PAO (filled circles) and 1 μm herbimycin A + PAO (open circles) on the SK channels in cell-attached patches.

The SK channels are mainly responsible for K+ secretion in the CCD (2.Giebisch G. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: F817-F833Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3.Wang W.H. Hebert S.C. Giebisch G. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1997; 59: 413-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 4.Frindt G. Palmer L.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1989; 256: F143-F151Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7.Wang W. Schwab A. Giebisch G. Am. J. Physiol. 1990; 259: F494-F502Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19.Frindt G. Palmer L.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1987; 252: F458-F467Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This conclusion is based on the observation that SK channels have high channel open probability and channel density. In addition, the maxi-K+ channels have been found to be expressed mainly in intercalated cells, which are not involved in K+ secretion (20.Pácha J. Frindt G. Sackin H. Palmer L.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 261: F696-F705PubMed Google Scholar). It is generally believed that ROMK channels are the key components of the native SK channels since the biophysical properties of the SK channels are the same as those of ROMK channels (2.Giebisch G. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: F817-F833Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3.Wang W.H. Hebert S.C. Giebisch G. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1997; 59: 413-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 21.Palmer L.G. Choe H. Frindt G. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: F404-F410Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22.Hebert S.C. Kidney Int. 1995; 48: 1010-1016Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 23.Ho K. Nichols C.G. Lederer W.J. Lytton J. Vassilev P.M. Kanazirska M.V. Hebert S.C. Nature. 1993; 362: 31-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (831) Google Scholar).Our previous study and others have demonstrated that the number of the apical SK channels increases by 1–2-fold in the CCDs obtained from rats on a high K+ diet (7.Wang W. Schwab A. Giebisch G. Am. J. Physiol. 1990; 259: F494-F502Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8.Palmer L.G. Antonian L. Frindt G. J. Gen. Physiol. 1994; 105: 693-710Crossref Scopus (157) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that the effect of high K+ intake on the SK channels was not directly mediated by aldosterone since infusion of aldosterone failed to increase channel activity. This notion is also suggested by previous renal clearance studies in which K+ secretion was partially restored in adrenalectomized animals receiving basal aldosterone levels and a high K+ intake (24.Stanton B. Pan L. Deetjen H. Guckian V. Giebisch G. J. Clin. Invest. 1987; 79: 198-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). In contrast, K+secretion was still blunted in animals receiving only high levels of aldosterone (24.Stanton B. Pan L. Deetjen H. Guckian V. Giebisch G. J. Clin. Invest. 1987; 79: 198-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is possible that aldosterone is not directly responsible for mediating the effect of dietary K+intake on the number of SK channels. In addition, high K+intake-induced increase in the channel number was not the result of an increase in the transcription level. Frindt et al. (25.Frindt G. Zhou H. Sackin H. Palmer L.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: F525-F531Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have used in situ hybridization to demonstrate that the level of mRNA encoding ROMK channel is the same between the CCDs from rats on normal diet and those on a high K+ diet. This suggests that the effect of dietary K+ intake on the channel activity is achieved at the post-translation level.We have shown previously that the protein expression of c-Src increased significantly in the kidney from animals on a K+-deficient diet in comparison with those on a high K+ diet (1.Wang W.H. Lerea K.M. Chan M. Giebisch G. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: F165-F171Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, inhibition of PTK increased the number of the apical SK channels in the CCDs from rats on a K+-deficient diet. In contrast, inhibition of PTK had no significant effect on channel activity in tubules from animals on a high K+ diet (1.Wang W.H. Lerea K.M. Chan M. Giebisch G. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: F165-F171Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We have postulated that an increase in PTK activity is involved in suppressing the channel activity in the CCDs from rats on a K+-deficient diet. An increase in PTK activity is expected to enhance the PTK-induced tyrosine phosphorylation. Since tyrosine phosphorylation is controlled by both PTK and PTP, it is conceivable that the PTP should also play an important role in the regulation of the number of the apical SK channels. PTP1D is an Src homology 2 domain containing PTPs and is ubiquitously distributed in a variety of tissues (26.Barford D. Jia Z.C. Tonks N.K. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 1043-1053Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Our Western blot analysis demonstrated that the PTP-1D is expressed in the renal cortex while no detectable level of PTP-1C and PTP-1B is present in the kidney. The expression level of PTP-1D in the renal cortex from rats on a high K+ diet is not significantly different from those on a control diet. Since the activity of PTP-1D in the tubules from rats on different K+diets was not assessed, it is not known whether the enzyme activity of PTP-1D is higher in the kidney from rats on a high K+ diet than those on a normal diet. However, we confirmed the previous finding that c-Src expression was significantly lower in the kidney from rats on a high K+ diet than those on a control diet or on a K+-deficient diet. In addition, we have previously reported that the enzyme activity of c-Src decreased significantly in the kidney obtained from rats on a high K+ diet (1.Wang W.H. Lerea K.M. Chan M. Giebisch G. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: F165-F171Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, it is conceivable that a decrease in PTK activity should increase the tyrosine dephosphorylation process in the tubules from rats on a high K+ diet.Two lines of evidence strongly suggest that tyrosine phosphorylation and dephosphorylation are involved in the regulation of the number of the apical SK channels. First, inhibition of PTP reversibly reduced the number of the functional SK channels in the CCD from rats on a high K+ diet. In contrast, inhibition of PTK increased the channel activity in the tubules from rats on a K+-deficient diet. Second, the effect of PAO on channel activity was completely abolished by inhibition of tyrosine kinases, although application of herbimycin A alone had no effect on channel activity in the tubules from rats on a high K+ diet. The absence of response to herbimycin A of the CCD from rats on a high K+ diet may be due to the fact that PTK-induced inhibition is suppressed by PTP because of low activity of c-Src. This notion was also suggested by the present observation that the inhibitory effect of PTK on channel activity could be demonstrated when PTP activity was blocked by PAO. Thus, the number of the functional SK channels is determined by the interaction between PTP and PTK.The mechanism by which inhibition of PTP reduced the number of the apical SK channels is not known. There are at least three possibilities by which PTP could regulate the channel activity. First, the SK channel could be phosphorylated by PTK. Thus, the phosphorylation of tyrosine residue inhibits, whereas the dephosphorylation increases, the channel activity. Indeed, the tyrosine phosphorylation/dephosphorylation regulates the Ca2+-activated K+ channels (27.Prevarskaya N.B. Skryma R.N. Vacher P. Daniel N. Djiane J. Dufy B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24292-24299Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), delayed rectifier K+ channels (28.Huang X.Y. Morielli A.D. Peralta E.G. Cell. 1993; 75: 1145-1156Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar), and voltage-gated K+ channels (KV1.3) (29.Bowlby M.R. Fadool D.A. Holmes T.C. Levitan I.B. J. Gen. Physiol. 1997; 110: 601-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). However, the previous finding that application of exogenously active c-Src failed to inhibit the SK channel did not support the possibility that direct tyrosine phosphorylation/dephosphorylation regulates the activity of the SK channels in the CCD (1.Wang W.H. Lerea K.M. Chan M. Giebisch G. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: F165-F171Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The second possibility is that inhibition of PTP may block the insertion of the SK channels through a recycling or a secretory pathway and, accordingly, reduce the number of SK channels in the apical membrane. However, this possibility was not supported by observations that addition of brefeldin A, colchicine, and Taxol had no effect on channel activity. In contrast, PAO reduced the number of the SK channels in the same CCD in which other agents failed to affect channel activity. Thus, although we could not completely exclude the second possibility, it is unlikely that a decrease in channel insertion is mainly responsible for mediating the effect of inhibiting PTP in the present study. The third possibility is that inhibition of PTP increased the intern"

RNA. 1997; 3: 954-960PubMed Google Scholar, 2.Martinis S.A. Plateau P. Cavarelli J. Florentz C. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4591-4596Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). A unique feature of aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases from multicellular eukaryotes is their assembly into an ∼1 × 106-Da multiprotein complex (for reviews see Refs. 3.Kisselev L.L. Wolfson A.D. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 1994; 48: 83-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar and 4.Yang D.C.H. Curr. Top. Cell. Regul. 1996; 34: 101-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Electron microscopic studies (5.Norcum M.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 15043-15051Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6.Norcum M.T. FEBS Lett. 1999; 447: 217-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) show it to be cup shaped with a characteristic Y-like view in which a deep central cleft is visible. The aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase components of the particle are the arginyl-tRNA synthetase dimer, the aspartyl-tRNA synthetase dimer, the bifunctional glutamyl-/prolyl-tRNA synthetase, glutaminyl-tRNA synthetase, isoleucyl-tRNA synthetase, leucyl-tRNA synthetase, the lysyl-tRNA synthetase dimer, and methionyl-tRNA synthetase. The complex also contains three auxiliary proteins. It has been suggested that p18 and p38 are used for interactions with protein translation factors (7.Quevillon S. Mirande M. FEBS Lett. 1996; 395: 63-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) or protein-protein interactions within the multisynthetase particle (8.Quevillon S. Robinson J.C. Berthonneau E. Siatecka M. Mirande M. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 183-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), respectively. However, p43 appears to have multiple functions. One role for p43 may be in tRNA trafficking (see Ref. 9.Wolin S.L. Matera A.G. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar and references therein), but a variety of other biological functions are possible, because it is a precursor form (10.Quevillon S. Agou F. Robinson J.-C. Mirande M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32573-32579Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar) of endothelial monocyte-activating polypeptide II (EMAP II).1Release of EMAP II leads to acute inflammation and plays a role in apoptotic processes (reviewed in Ref. 11.Tas M.P.R. Murray J.C. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1996; 28: 837-841Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Processing of p43 into EMAP II by caspase 7 may be part of a coordinated scheme that attracts macrophages to sites of apoptosis (12.Behrensdorf H.A. van de Craen M. Knies U.E. Vandenabeele P. Clauss M. FEBS Lett. 2000; 466: 143-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). This cytokine is also found in autoimmune lesions in the nervous system (13.Schluesener H.J. Seid K. Meyermann R. Acta Neuropathol. 1999; 97: 119-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). It sensitizes tumors to tumor necrosis factor α (14.Gnant M.F.X. Berger A.C. Huang J. Puhlmann M. Wu P.C. Merino M.J. Bartlett D.L. Alexander Jr., H.R. Libutti S.K. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 4668-4674PubMed Google Scholar) and inhibits neovascularization of metastatic carcinomas (15.Schwarz M.A. Kandel J. Brett J. Li J. Hayward J. Schwarz R.E. Chappey O. Wautier J.-L. Chabot J. Gerfo P.L. Stern D. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 190: 341-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Thus, the presence of the precursor form of EMAP II in an assembly of enzymes necessary for protein biosynthesis appears incongruous. As an initial step toward understanding this intriguing association, this study localizes the cytokine portion of p43 within the multisynthetase complex using antibodies directed against EMAP II. The information obtained is used to refine the three-domain model of the particle and to propose a role for p43 within the multisynthetase complex. Isolation of the multisynthetase complex from rabbit reticulocyte lysate (Green Hectares) was carried out as described previously (16.Norcum M.T. Warrington J.A. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 79-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Samples of 0.8-μg multisynthetase complex were subjected to denaturing electrophoresis (17.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar) on a 10% polyacrylamide gel and then transblotted onto nitrocellulose membrane using standard methods (18.Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44939) Google Scholar). Reaction of component polypeptides with comparable dilutions of either normal rabbit serum (Sigma) or of rabbit antiserum generated against recombinant mature EMAP II (19.Knies U.E. Behrensdorf H.A. Mitchell C.A. Deutsch U. Risau W. Drexler H.C.A. Clauss M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12322-12327Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) were detected with alkaline phosphatase-labeled goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulin (Sigma) using bromochloroindoyl phosphate and nitroblue tetrazolium colorimetric substrates (Schleicher and Schuell). Samples (8 μg) of two separate preparations of multisynthetase complex were placed into an equal volume of high performance liquid chromatography buffer (25 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, 100 mm NaCl) containing a 1:5 or 1:10 dilution of anti-EMAP II antiserum. After 1.5 or 3 h, the entire mixture was applied to a 30-cm × 4.6-mm BIOSEP-SEC-S4000 column (Phenomenex) in the same buffer for isolation of immunocomplexes (20.Norcum M.T. Dignam J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12205-12208Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Samples were prepared for electron microscopy by staining with 1% uranyl acetate as described previously (20.Norcum M.T. Dignam J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12205-12208Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Electron micrographs of the negatively stained samples were obtained with a LEO 912AB microscope operated at 100 kV using an absolute magnification of 31,500. Micrographs were digitized using a flatbed scanner at an optical resolution corresponding to 6.4 Å per pixel on the image scale. Orientation of the multisynthetase complex and position of antibody binding site or sites were recorded for each immunocomplex identified. Composite figures were prepared for presentation using Adobe Photoshop. The specificity of the antiserum directed against EMAP II for the cytokine was previously demonstrated (19.Knies U.E. Behrensdorf H.A. Mitchell C.A. Deutsch U. Risau W. Drexler H.C.A. Clauss M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12322-12327Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). However, an immunoblot analysis (Fig.1) was carried out to determine its reactivity within the context of the multiple components of the multisynthetase complex. Anti-EMAP II antibodies are strongly reactive with p43. Much weaker, but clearly detectable, cross-reactivity is observed with isoleucyl-tRNA synthetase. Thus, two locations of antibody binding are expected when this polyclonal antiserum is used in immunoelectron microscopy experiments. Fig. 2 contains examples of electron microscopic images of individual multisynthetase complex particles to which anti-EMAP II antibodies are bound. Schematic drawings are included to illustrate each type of immunocomplex. Images in rows 1 and 2 show the most common antibody binding site. As described in terms of characteristic orientations and the three-domain model of the multisynthetase particle (5.Norcum M.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 15043-15051Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16.Norcum M.T. Warrington J.A. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 79-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), this site is slightly above the midpoint of the particle but close to the intersection of one arm and the base. Row 1 depicts immunocomplexes with full views of the front or back of the multisynthetase complex. Bound antibodies are seen lying to the side of the particle (panels 1A to 1C) or protruding from the top of the cleft (panels 1D to 1F). These images demonstrate the proximity of the antibody binding site to the lower edge of the central cleft. In row 2, the multisynthetase complex is in intermediate orientations, where the particle is rotated or tilted so that the cleft is no longer seen. The clear visibility of bound antibody molecules indicates binding to the surface of the particle near its midpoint. That this anti-EMAP II antiserum contains antibodies directed against more than one epitope within p43 is demonstrated by panels 2D to 2F, in which two closely spaced antibodies are bound. Consistent relative stoichiometry measurements (data not shown and Ref. 3.Kisselev L.L. Wolfson A.D. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 1994; 48: 83-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) exclude the possibility that the particle contains multiple copies of p43. Images in row 3 are examples of antibody binding to the secondary site. Panels 3A to 3C again show front or back views of the multisynthetase complex. The bound antibodies are near the edge of the base furthest from the upper arms. Panels 3D to 3F show immunocomplexes with one antibody in each of the primary and secondary binding sites. Immunocomplexes were also observed in which one antibody is bound to the multisynthetase complex in a third characteristic orientation. This is the approximately square view that is interpreted to be of the top or bottom of the particle. These images do not provide exact placement of the antibody binding sites. However, when multiple antibodies are bound (row 4), one can determine the spatial orientation of the two binding sites. As shown in panels 4A to 4C, the bound antibodies are on opposite sides of the particle. Using the interpretation that these views are down the long axis of the particle, the two binding sites must be on opposite faces of the multisynthetase complex. The two sites can be distinguished from one another based on images seen in panels 4D to 4F. These show two closely spaced bound antibodies on one side of the particle and a third on the opposite side. The first is likely the primary site near the center of the molecule because of the common observation of two closely spaced antibodies at this site in immunocomplexes where the multisynthetase particle is seen from the side. The binding site with one antibody is then defined as the secondary site in the particle base. It is noteworthy that no immunocomplexes with the multisynthetase complex in the triangular or intermediate views showed more than one antibody bound to the base of the particle. Fig. 3 contains images of immunocomplexes in which individual anti-EMAP II antibodies are bound to two separate multisynthetase complex particles. All of the orientations of bound antibodies and multisynthetase particles are represented in such dimers. In the images in row 1, antibodies are bound to the primary binding site near the midpoint of the multisynthetase complex. Panels 1A and 1B show the most common views in which the antibodies lie to the side of each multisynthetase particle. The closeness of the two particles and limited antibody visibility strongly emphasize that the binding site is in a central position within the particle. The image in panel 1C shows the alternate orientation of antibodies in the primary site. That is, bound antibody extends from the top of the particle. Again such images place the antibody binding site deep in the central cleft. Row 2 shows immunocomplexes with antibodies bound to the secondary site in the base of the multisynthetase complex. This is especially clear in the particle on the right side of panel 2A. In panels 2B and 2C, two bound antibodies are visible. In each case, one is at the primary site, and the other is at the secondary site. The images in row 3 reiterate that the two binding sites are on opposite faces of the multisynthetase complex. In panel 3A, two closely spaced bound antibodies connect the two multisynthetase particles. A third bound antibody is on the opposite side of the particle on the right. The central stain-filled hole indicates that this is in the top orientation. Both particles in panel 3B are viewed from the bottom. The two antibodies bound to the particle in the upper right are distinctly seen on opposite edges. Panel 3C is a similar example, except that a third antibody is lying very near the upper edge of the particle on the right. Fig.4 is a cartoon depicting the locations of anti-EMAP II antibody binding to the multisynthetase complex. In this schematic, when viewed from the front, the three domains and central cleft between the arms of the particle are visible. The primary binding site is located at the midpoint of the particle at the lower edge of the cleft. This site was defined from the 280 (85%) images showing side views of the multisynthetase complex and bound antibodies near the midpoint of the particle where the arms meet the base. As the multisynthetase complex is rotated around its long axis into intermediate views, the secondary binding site in the base becomes partially visible. This was designated the minor site because only 50 (15%) of the side views of the multisynthetase particle showed antibody in this site. These assignments were emphasized by the 169 immunocomplexes with multiple antibodies bound to side orientations of the multisynthetase complex. Of these, 135 (80%) had two closely spaced bound antibodies near the center of the particle. In the remaining 34 (20%), one antibody was bound to the secondary site in the base of the particle, and either one or two antibodies were bound to the primary site. When the multisynthetase complex is fully rotated to the back orientation, then the face containing the secondary binding site is uppermost, whereas the primary site is on the hidden face. Placement of the binding sites on opposite faces of the multisynthetase complex is required for consistency with images of the top or bottom of the particle. That is, 37 (59%) of the immunocomplexes with top or bottom views of the multisynthetase particle and more than one bound antibody showed two closely spaced antibodies bound on one side of the particle, that is, in the primary binding site. However, the remaining images showed antibodies bound to opposite sides of the particles and so indicated that the binding sites are on opposite faces of the multisynthetase complex. Overall 418 immunocomplexes were analyzed in which the positions of 697 bound antibodies were mapped. Only 27 (4%) were inconsistent with either the primary or secondary site as depicted in Fig. 4. Immunoblot analysis shows that the strongest reaction of antibodies within the anti-EMAP II antiserum is with p43. Regardless of whether this is because of higher titer of this population, stronger affinity, or both, this result suggests that the majority of bound antibodies observed in electron microscopic images of immunocomplexes will react with this polypeptide. In each of the types of immunocomplex analyzed in this study, a marked majority of antibody binding was to an area at the midpoint of the multisynthetase complex near the lowest portion of the central cleft. These data support the assignment of the primary binding site to the cytokine portion of p43. Similarly, the weak reaction of anti-EMAP II antiserum with the isoleucyl-tRNA synthetase polypeptide, coupled with the observation of much smaller percentages of antibodies bound to the base of the multisynthetase particle, suggest that the secondary binding site is within this enzyme. Additional evidence in support of these assignments comes from the three-domain model of the multisynthetase complex (16.Norcum M.T. Warrington J.A. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 79-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), in which isoleucyl-, leucyl-, and glutamyl-/prolyl-tRNA synthetases were placed together in the base of the particle. The association of these enzymes was confirmed by an extensive two-hybrid analysis (21.Rho S.B. Kim M.J. Lee J.S. Seol W. Motegi H. Kim S. Shiba K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4488-4493Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Moreover, the glutamyl-/prolyl-tRNA synthetase has been located in or near the base using immunoelectron microscopy (20.Norcum M.T. Dignam J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12205-12208Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Cross-linking, (16.Norcum M.T. Warrington J.A. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 79-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) genetic analysis (8.Quevillon S. Robinson J.C. Berthonneau E. Siatecka M. Mirande M. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 183-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), and immunoprecipitation experiments (22.Park S.G. Jung K.H. Lee J.S. Jo Y.J. Motegi H. Kim S. Shiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16673-16676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) have documented that p43 is associated with arginyl- and glutaminyl-tRNA synthetases. Both of these enzymes have been assigned to the domains making up the upper arms of the model of the multisynthetase complex (16.Norcum M.T. Warrington J.A. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 79-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Thus, it is logical to assign the primary anti-EMAP II binding site in the central portion of the particle to p43. Based on the location of the primary binding site, p43 can be reliably placed in a central position in the model of the multisynthetase complex (Fig. 5). To satisfy the constraints of previous studies (8.Quevillon S. Robinson J.C. Berthonneau E. Siatecka M. Mirande M. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 183-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 16.Norcum M.T. Warrington J.A. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 79-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), the polypeptide is depicted as an elongated molecule extending the width of the complex. That p43 likely consists of at least two distinct domains connected by a linker region accessible to proteases is suggested by in vivo processing of pro-EMAPII into the 22-kDa cytokine by caspases (12.Behrensdorf H.A. van de Craen M. Knies U.E. Vandenabeele P. Clauss M. FEBS Lett. 2000; 466: 143-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The directionality of p43 within the multisynthetase complex can also be established. That is, based on the spatial relationship of the anti-EMAP II binding sites, the C-terminal cytokine portion of the polypeptide is located on the opposite side of the particle from isoleucyl-tRNA synthetase. The new data and results from recent genetic analyses (8.Quevillon S. Robinson J.C. Berthonneau E. Siatecka M. Mirande M. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 183-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 21.Rho S.B. Kim M.J. Lee J.S. Seol W. Motegi H. Kim S. Shiba K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4488-4493Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) allow further refinement of the three-domain model of the multisynthetase complex. The polypeptide positions within domain III have been rearranged to a clockwise progression from glutamyl-/prolyl-tRNA synthetase to leucyl-tRNA synthetase to isoleucyl-tRNA synthetase when viewed from the bottom of the model. The base domain has also been rotated slightly to allow more overlap with components in the arms. A biological utility of the seemingly paradoxical association of a proinflammatory and apoptosis-inducing cytokine with essential enzymes of protein biosynthesis has been suggested in discussions of the presence of EMAP II and EMAP II-like domains within tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase and methionyl-tRNA synthetase and of p43/EMAP II within the multisynthetase complex (reviewed in Ref. 23.Weiner A.M. Maizels N. Science. 1999; 284: 63-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Specifically, association of EMAP II with aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases may poise cells for rapid acceleration of cell death by disruption of the protein translation machinery after generation of an apoptotic signal. The chemotactic effects of the cytokine then promote inflammatory processes for removal of cellular debris. This study has shown that p43/EMAP II is located at or very near the junction of the three major domains of the multisynthetase complex. Thus, it is well positioned to affect the overall structure and stability of the particle and so may promote rapid breakdown of the multisynthetase complex upon release of the cytokine. Under normal cellular conditions, the central location of p43/EMAP II and its ability to modulate the activity of arginyl-tRNA synthetase (22.Park S.G. Jung K.H. Lee J.S. Jo Y.J. Motegi H. Kim S. Shiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16673-16676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) suggest that p43/EMAP II may play a role in optimizing aminoacylation events within the multisynthetase complex. This may involve direct effects on individual enzymes or general effects on the structure or stability of the particle. Sincere thanks are given to Dr. Matthias Clauss for generously providing antiserum and to Dr. J. David Dignam for encouragement and many helpful discussions."
https://openalex.org/W2014555962,"Abstract The spider toxin ω-agatoxin IIIA (ω-Aga-IIIA) is a potent inhibitor of high voltage-activated calcium currents in the mammalian brain. To establish the biochemical parameters governing its action, we radiolabeled the toxin and examined its binding to native and recombinant calcium channels. In experiments with purified rat synaptosomal membranes, both kinetic and equilibrium data demonstrate one-to-one binding of ω-Aga-IIIA to a single population of high affinity sites, with K d = ∼9 pm andB max = ∼1.4 pmol/mg protein. Partial inhibition of ω-Aga-IIIA binding by ω-conotoxins GVIA, MVIIA, and MVIIC identifies N and P/Q channels as components of this population. ω-Aga-IIIA binds to recombinant α1B and α1E calcium channels with a similar high affinity (K d = ∼5–9 pm) in apparent one-to-one fashion. Results from recombinant α1B binding experiments demonstrate virtually identicalB max values for ω-Aga-IIIA and ω-conotoxin MVIIA, providing further evidence for a one-to-one stoichiometry of agatoxin binding to calcium channels. The combined evidence suggests that ω-Aga-IIIA defines a unique, high affinity binding site on N-, P/Q-, and R-type calcium channels."

Gαi2 was principally associated with the plasma membrane and microsomes. Both F-actin and Gαi2 were detected by Western blot analysis in a purified plasma membrane preparation, the supernatant and pellet obtained by treating the plasma membrane with Triton X-100, and after depolymerization and repolymerization of F-actin in the Triton X-100-insoluble pellet. Actin in the Triton X-100-soluble supernatant co-precipitated with Gαi2 using either anti-Gαi2 or anti-actin antibodies.

Capacitative Calcium Entry. Landes Biomedical Publishing, Austin, TX1997Crossref Google Scholar). Although it has been widely accepted that the key event initiating the opening of store-operated Ca2+ channels (SOCs) in the plasma membrane is the decrease in the concentration of Ca2+ in the lumen of the ER, neither the mechanism that couples these two events nor the structures of SOCs are well understood (2.Barritt G.J. Biochem. J. 1999; 337: 153-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). The results of recent experiments indicate that an essential prerequisite for the activation of SOCs is the close association between regions of the ER and the plasma membrane (3.Putney Jr., J.W. Cell. 1999; 99: 5-8Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). It is proposed that this association is maintained by cytoskeletal elements such as the F-actin (4.Rossier M.F. Bird G.S.J. Putney Jr., J.W. Biochem. J. 1991; 274: 643-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). There is evidence that, in some cell types, dismantling of the F-actin cytoskeleton (5.Holda J.R. Blatter L.A.

Hepatocytes are polarized epithelial cells in which the F-actin cytoskeleton is distributed around the cortex, with a high concentration at the pericanalicular (apical) region (9.French S.W. Cadrin M. Kawahara H. Kachi K. LeBouton A.V. Molecular and Cellular Biology of the Liver. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1993: 143-180Google Scholar). This cortical F-actin may play a role in maintaining subregions of the ER close to the plasma membrane (4.Rossier M.F. Bird G.S.J. Putney Jr., J.W. Biochem. J. 1991; 274: 643-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Evidence, including results obtained with a microinjected inhibitory anti-Gαi2 antibody, indicates that the activation of SOCs in hepatocytes requires the trimeric G-protein Gi2 (10.Berven L.A.

Biochem. 1996; 62: 334-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Moreover, studies with other cell types have provided evidence for an association between Gαi2 and F-actin (13.Särndahl E.

Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 1503-1511Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and have suggested a potential role for Gαi2 in organization of the F-actin cytoskeleton (16.Sheth B. Banks P. Burton D.R. Monk P.N. Biochem. J. 1991; 275: 809-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 17.Wieland T. Meyer Zu Heringdorf D. Schulze R.A. Kaldenberg-Stasch S. Jakobs K.H. Eur. J.

On the basis of these observations, we proposed that Gi2 may regulate arrangement of the actin cytoskeleton and the arrangement of the ER by which both the intimate plasma membrane-ER association is achieved and the communication between different parts of the ER is maintained and allows the activation of SOCs. The aims of the present experiments were to elucidate the role of Gi2 in the activation of SOCs in hepatocytes by investigating the intracellular distribution of Gαi2 and F-actin, the association of Gαi2 with F-actin, and the requirement for Gαi2-F-actin interaction in regulation of the arrangement of F-actin and in the activation of SOCs. The results indicate that a significant proportion of the cellular Gαi2 is associated with F-actin and regulates F-actin organization (especially the cortical actin layer near the canalicular membrane) and the arrangement of the ER. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of the role of Gαi2 in regulating the arrangement of F-actin in an epithelial cell type. Taken together with previous evidence that the normal function of Gαi2 is required for the activation of SOCs in rat hepatocytes (10.Berven L.A. Crouch M.F. Katsis F. Kemp B.E. Harland L.M. Barritt G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25893-25897Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), these observations suggest that Gαi2, either through regulation of cortical F-actin organization and/or arrangement of the ER, allows the normal activation of SOCs. Affinity-purified rabbit polyclonal anti-Gαi antibody, raised against the C-terminal decapeptide (KENLKDCGLF) of the α-subunit of transducin, was kindly provided by Dr. Michael Crouch (John Curtin School of Medical Research, Australian National University, Canberra, Australia). Although this antibody detects both Gαi1 and Gαi2, liver does not express detectable Gαi1 (19.Griffiths S. Knowler J.T. Houslay M.D. Eur. J.

Purified phosphoprotein phosphatases 1 and 2A were kind gifts from Dr. Alistair Sim (University of Newcastle, Australia). Pertussis toxin, affinity-purified rabbit polyclonal anti-actin antibody, goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to alkaline phosphatase, actin standard for Western blotting, protein A-Sepharose, Triton X-100, nitro blue tetrazolium, and bromochloroindolyl phosphate were from Sigma, and Texas Red-X phalloidin, 3,3′-dihexyloxacarbocyanine iodide (DiOC6(3)), fura-2, and goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to AlexaTM 488 were from Molecular Probes, Inc. (Eugene, OR). Recombinant Gαi2 protein was from Calbiochem (Alexandria, Australia). All other chemicals and materials were of the highest grade commercially available. SDS-PAGE was performed on 12% polyacrylamide resolving gels with the Laemmli discontinuous buffer system (21.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar), and the resolved proteins were electrotransferred to nitrocellulose membranes by the method of Towbin et al. (22.Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44644) Google Scholar). Membranes were blocked with 1 m glycine containing 5% (w/v) nonfat milk powder, 5% (v/v) fetal calf serum, and 1% (w/v) ovalbumin for 1 h at room temperature and then washed three times (5 min each) at room temperature with 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20, 0.1% (w/v) nonfat milk powder, and 0.1% (w/v) ovalbumin dissolved in 137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 8 mm Na2HPO4, and 1.4 mm KH2PO4 (pH 7.2). Membranes were incubated overnight at 4 °C with either anti-Gαi antibody (1:200 dilution in the above wash buffer) or anti-actin antibody (1:100 dilution) or, in some cases, both antibodies together followed by incubation with secondary antibody (goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to alkaline phosphatase, 1:1000 dilution) for 2 h at room temperature and finally developed for 5 min in 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 9.5), 100 mm NaCl, and 5 mm MgCl2 containing 0.33 mg/ml nitro blue tetrazolium and 0.16 mg/ml bromochloroindolyl phosphate. Quantitation of the bands was performed on a Bio-Rad model GS-700 imaging densitometer driven by the Molecular Analyst software package (Bio-Rad). SDS-PAGE in the presence of 6 m urea was conducted as described by Komatsu et al. (23.Komatsu M. McDermott A.M. Gillison S.L. Sharp G.W.G. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 1857-1863Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Rat livers were homogenized in a medium containing 250 mmsucrose, 5 mm HEPES/KOH (pH 7.4), and 1 mm EGTA (homogenization medium), supplemented with 1 mmdithiothreitol, 0.2 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml pepstatin A (protease inhibitor mixture) and subcellular fractions prepared by differential centrifugation (24.Lièvremont J.-P. Hill A.-M. Hilly M. Mauger J.-P. Biochem. J. 1994; 300: 419-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), with the 100,000 × g supernatant being designated the “cytosolic fraction.” A purified plasma membrane fraction and a nuclei-contaminated plasma membrane fraction were prepared by Percoll gradient centrifugation (25.Prpic V. Green K.C. Blackmore P.F. Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 1382-1385Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined by the Bradford method (26.Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211983) Google Scholar) with bovine serum albumin as a standard. The activities of the marker enzymes 5′-nucleotidase (plasma membrane) and glucose-6-phosphatase (ER) were determined as described by Aronson and Touster (27.Aronson Jr., N.N. Touster O. Methods Enzymol. 1974; 31: 90-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar). The liver cytosolic fraction (100 μl) was diluted with an equivalent volume of homogenization medium supplemented with 1% (w/v) Triton X-100, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and the protease inhibitor mixture. Either 5 μl (5 units; 1 unit of the enzyme is defined as the amount that hydrolyzes 1 nmol of phosphate from the phosphorylated proteins per min at 30 °C, pH 7.0) of phosphoprotein phosphatase 1 or 5 μl (5 units) of phosphoprotein phosphatase 2A or 5 μl of vehicle (control) was added to 25 μl of the above diluted cytosolic extract. The mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 1 h, mixed with 30 μl of Laemmli sample buffer, boiled, and subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blotting analysis. Plasma membrane pellets were resuspended in lysis buffer, which consisted of 50 mmHEPES (pH 7.4), 1% (w/v) Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm Na3VO4, 100 mm NaF, 10 mmNa4P2O7, 10% (w/v) glycerol, supplemented with the protease inhibitor mixture, and incubated on ice for 1 h. A Triton X-100-insoluble pellet and a Triton X-100-soluble supernatant were obtained by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 10 min. F-actin present in the plasma membrane Triton X-100-insoluble pellet was subjected to two cycles of depolymerization and repolymerization as described by Ueda et al. (15.Ueda H. Saga S. Shinohara H. Morishita R. Kato K. Asano T. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 1503-1511Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the final fraction was called the “repolymerized F-actin fraction.” All fractions were quantitatively mixed with Laemmli sample buffer for Western blot analysis. The plasma membrane Triton X-100-soluble supernatant prepared as described above was incubated on ice for 2 h with either an anti-Gαi or an anti-actin antibody or with normal rabbit serum (as control). Samples were mixed with swollen protein A-Sepharose (5 mg, dry weight), and the incubation continued for a further 1 h. Immune complexes bound to protein A-Sepharose were collected by centrifugation (12,000 ×g, 1 min). The pellets were washed three times in 0.2m NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), resuspended in Laemmli sample buffer, boiled for 5 min, and centrifuged (12,000 × g, 1 min), and the supernatant was retained for SDS-PAGE and Western blotting analysis. Pertussis toxin (25 μg in 50 mmTris, pH 7.5, 10 mm glycine, 0.5 m NaCl, 50% (v/v) glycerol/100 g of body weight) or vehicle was administered to Hooded Wistar rats by intraperitoneal injection (28.Lynch C.J. Prpic V. Blackmore P.F. Exton J.H. Mol. Pharmacol. 1986; 29: 196-203PubMed Google Scholar). After 24 h, hepatocytes were isolated by collagenase perfusion (29.Berry M.N. Edwards A.M. Barritt G.J. Burdon R.H. van Knippenberg P.H. Laboratory Techniques in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology. 21. Elsevier, Amsterdam1991: 15-81Google Scholar) and grown in primary culture on type I collagen-coated coverslips (30.Berven L.A. Hughes B.P. Barritt G.J. Biochem. J. 1994; 299: 399-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The locations of the F-actin and ER were determined using Texas Red-X phalloidin and DiOC6(3), respectively, and confocal microscopy as described previously (31.Gregory R.B. Wilcox R.A. Berven L.A. van Straten N.C.R. van der Marel G.A. van Boom J.H. Barritt G.J. Biochem. J. 1999; 341: 401-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Negative controls for ER and F-actin staining were carried out systematically by omitting DiOC6(3) and Texas Red-X phalloidin, respectively. Determination of the location of Gαi2 by immunofluorescence was performed as described previously (10.Berven L.A. Crouch M.F. Katsis F. Kemp B.E. Harland L.M. Barritt G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25893-25897Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Controls were performed by omitting either the primary antibody or the secondary antibody or both and by incubating the primary antibody with excess blocking peptide before use. For double labeling of F-actin and Gαi2 in the same cell, F-actin staining was first performed as described above. The cells were then washed with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20 and 1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin (Tween solution) and incubated overnight at 4 °C with anti-Gαi antibody (5 μg/ml in Tween solution). Thereafter, cells were washed six times with the Tween solution, incubated with secondary antibody (AlexaTM 488-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG, 1:100 dilution in Tween solution), and washed twice with Tween solution and four times with phosphate-buffered saline before the coverslips were mounted on slides in 50% glycerol in phosphate-buffered saline. Confocal microscopy was performed using a Bio-Rad MRC-1000 laser-scanning confocal microscope system in combination with a Nikon Diaphot 300 inverted microscope and a × 40 NA 1.15 water immersion objective lens. The excitation and emission wavelengths were set at 568/10 and 605/35 nm, respectively, for Texas Red-X, and at 488/10 and 522/32 nm, respectively, for DiOC6(3) and AlexaTM 488. To standardize the fluorescence intensity measurements among experiments, the time of image capturing, the image intensity gain, the image enhancement, and the image black level were optimally adjusted at the outset and kept constant for each of Texas Red-X, DiOC6(3), and AlexaTM 488. In most cases, only images of the optical sections near the middle of thez axis were collected. Quantitative examination of the captured images was performed using CoMOS (Bio-Rad) image analysis software. To quantitate F-actin distribution, for each experimental condition, 60 hepatocyte doublets were randomly selected from the images obtained from three separate cell preparations (20 doublets from each preparation), and the fluorescence (pixels) in the total doublet and in the pericanalicular area was measured. The fluorescence in the pericanalicular area was expressed as a percentage of the total doublet fluorescence. This percentage indicates the relative amount of F-actin around the bile canaliculus and hence the degree of reorganization of F-actin during primary culture (cf. Ref. 32.Thibault N. Claude J.R. Ballet F. Toxicology. 1992; 73: 269-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). To avoid the subjectivity of this measurement, it was verified that the elliptical area designated as “pericanalicular area” occupied 9.95 ± 0.06% (mean ± S.E., n = 60) of the total area of control doublets and 9.92 ± 0.06% (mean ± S.E., n = 60) of the total area of pertussis toxin-treated doublets, respectively. Pellets (3000 × g for 2 min) of the plasma membrane fraction (∼1 mg) were fixed in 1 ml of 1% (w/v) glutaraldehyde in 25 mm HEPES buffer (pH 7.4) for 30 min on ice. After washing three times with 25 mm HEPES buffer, the samples were postfixed with 1% (w/v) OsO4 in the same HEPES buffer for 1 h on ice. Freshly isolated intact hepatocytes (pelleted by centrifugation at 80 × g for 30 s) were fixed for 2 h at room temperature in a solution containing 1% (w/v) OsO4 and 0.1 mNa2HPO4/NaH2PO4 (pH 7.4). Fixed samples were dehydrated by stepwise exposure to increasing concentrations of ethanol (50, 75, 85, 95, and 100% (v/v)) and embedded in Durcupan with propylene oxide as an intermediate transition medium. The ultrathin sections were cut on an ultramicrotome, stained with aqueous uranyl acetate and Reynold's lead citrate, and examined with a JEOL 1200 EX transmission electron microscope. Cytoplasmic free Ca2+ concentrations ([Ca2+]cyt) and initial rates of Ca2+ inflow (measured using a Ca2+ add-back protocol) in rat hepatocytes loaded with fura-2 by microinjection were determined using fluorescence microscopy (31.Gregory R.B. Wilcox R.A. Berven L.A. van Straten N.C.R. van der Marel G.A. van Boom J.H. Barritt G.J. Biochem. J. 1999; 341: 401-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). When rat liver homogenates were subjected to Western blot analysis, two forms of Gαi2, with apparent molecular masses of 41 and 43 kDa, were detected (Fig.1 A). The plasma membrane fraction contained predominantly the 41-kDa band, which co-migrated with recombinant Gαi2 (Fig. 1 B,lanes 1 and 2), while the cytosolic fraction contained predominantly the 43-kDa band (Fig. 1 B,lanes 3 and 4). Treatment of cytosolic fraction with phosphoprotein phosphatase 1 converted the 43-kDa form of Gαi2 to a form that co-migrates with recombinant Gαi2 (Fig. 1 C, lanes 1,2, and 5). By contrast, treatment with phosphoprotein phosphatase 2A did not alter the mobility of the 43-kDa band (Fig. 1 C, lanes 1, 3, and 6). These results indicate that (i) the 41-kDa form of Gαi2 (subsequently referred to as Gαi2) corresponds to the form of Gαi2 (nonphosphorylated) normally detected in most cell types and (ii) the species of Gαi2 with an apparent molecular mass of 43 kDa (subsequently referred to as phosphorylated Gαi2) is a phosphorylated form of Gαi2 (cf. Ref. 33.Katada T. Gilman A.G. Watanabe Y. Bauer S. Jakobs K.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1985; 151: 431-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar). Gαi2 was found in the plasma membrane, the nuclear-plasma membrane, and the heavy and light microsomal fractions of the liver (Fig. 2 A) but was barely detectable in the cytosolic fraction. The amount of Gαi2associated with the microsomes was estimated to be 40% of total cellular Gαi2. Gαi2 (41-kDa) was the predominant form of Gαi2 found in the plasma membrane and the nuclear plasma membrane fractions. Phosphorylated Gαi2 was principally found in the cytosolic fraction, but some was also associated with the heavy and light microsomes (Fig.2 A). In order to determine how tightly Gαi2 is associated with the microsomal membranes, the microsomes were treated with KCl, which has been shown to cause the dissociation of loosely bound proteins from liver microsomal membranes (34.Hinton R.H. Mullock B.M. Graham J.M. Rickwood D. Subcellular Fractionation: A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, New York1997: 42Google Scholar). Phosphorylated Gαi2, but not the non-phosphorylated form, could be removed from microsomes by treatment with KCl (Fig. 2 B). These results indicate that Gαi2 is tightly associated with microsomal vesicles, whereas phosphorylated Gαi2 is only loosely associated. The distribution of the phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated forms of Gαi2 within hepatocytes was further analyzed by determining the degrees of enrichment of the liver subcellular fractions in the two forms of Gαi2, 5′-nucleotidase (a plasma membrane marker enzyme) and glucose 6-phosphatase (an ER marker enzyme) (Fig. 3). The degree of enrichment of the purified plasma membrane fraction with Gαi2 is similar to that for 5′-nucleotidase, indicating that, as shown previously (12.Cadrin M. McFarlane-Anderson N. Harper M.-E. Gaffield J. Bégin-Heick N. J. Cell. Biochem. 1996; 62: 334-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), considerable Gαi2 is located at the plasma membrane of hepatocytes. A small amount of glucose-6-phosphatase activity was found to be associated with the purified plasma membrane fraction. This may reflect either contamination of the plasma membrane fraction with microsomes derived from the ER or the attachment of small regions of the ER to the plasma membrane (cf. Ref. 24.Lièvremont J.-P. Hill A.-M. Hilly M. Mauger J.-P. Biochem. J. 1994; 300: 419-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The degree of enrichment of the heavy and light microsomal fractions with Gαi2 is similar to that for glucose-6-phosphatase (Fig. 3). Consideration of the degrees of enrichment of these two fractions with 5′-nucleotidase, together with the observation that the purified plasma membrane fraction is equally enriched in 5′-nucleotidase and Gαi2, indicates that the presence of Gαi2 in the microsomal fractions is unlikely to be due to the contamination of these fractions by plasma membrane vesicles. The total amounts of phosphorylated Gαi2 and Gαi2 in the cytosolic fraction were estimated to be 84 ± 5 and 13 ± 3% (means ± S.E., n= 3 rat livers), respectively, of the total amount present in the homogenate. It has previously been shown that a purified liver plasma membrane fraction (prepared in a manner similar to that described above) contains F-actin, which is attached to the plasma membrane (35.Phillips M.J. Oda M. Yousef I.M. Funatsu K. J. Cell Biol. 1981; 91: 524-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Experiments were undertaken to determine whether Gαi2 is associated with this plasma membrane-associated actin. First, the quality of the plasma membrane fraction was further assessed by electron microscopy (Fig.4). This showed numerous extended sheets of membrane (large arrow), the presence of small vesicles adherent to some sheets (small arrows), and numerous other vesicles of varying size. The preparation was largely free of mitochondria and nuclei. The plasma membrane fraction was treated with 1% (w/v) Triton X-100 to solubilize membrane lipids and integral proteins and thereby to obtain, by centrifugation, a plasma membrane Triton X-100-insoluble pellet enriched in F-actin and other cytoskeletal components (15.Ueda H. Saga S. Shinohara H. Morishita R. Kato K. Asano T. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 1503-1511Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Gαi2 and actin were detected by Western blotting in both the Triton X-100-insoluble pellet (predominantly F-actin) and the Triton X-100-soluble supernatant (predominantly G-actin) (Fig.5). It was estimated by densitometric analysis that approximately 27 ± 3% (mean ± S.E.,n = 4) of the total plasma membrane Gαi2and approximately 45 ± 1% (mean ± S.E., n= 3) of the total plasma membrane actin were recovered in the plasma membrane Triton X-100-insoluble pellet. To further test that Gαi2 associates specifically with F-actin among the various cytoskeletal components of the plasma membrane, a repolymerized F-actin fraction was prepared from the plasma membrane Triton X-100-insoluble pellet by a two-step depolymerization-polymerization procedure (15.Ueda H. Saga S. Shinohara H. Morishita R. Kato K. Asano T. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 1503-1511Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Analysis by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting with anti-Gαi and anti-actin antibodies demonstrated the presence of Gαi2 in the repolymerized F-actin fraction (Fig. 5, lane 4). Approximately 44 ± 0% of the Gαi2 and 47 ± 2% of the actin in the plasma membrane Triton X-100-insoluble pellet were recovered in the final repolymerized F-actin fraction. This corresponds to 12 ± 0 and 21 ± 1% (means ± S.E.,n = 3) of the total plasma membrane Gαi2and actin, respectively. The idea that Gαi2 and actin associate near the plasma membrane was also investigated using a co-immunoprecipitation approach. When an anti-Gαi antibody was used to precipitate Gαi2 from the Triton X-100-soluble supernatant of the purified plasma membrane fraction, the precipitate was found to contain actin, identified using an anti-actin antibody and Western blot analysis (Fig. 6 A). When an anti-actin antibody was used to precipitate actin from the Triton X-100-soluble supernatant of the purified plasma membrane fraction, the precipitate was found to contain Gαi2, identified using an anti-Gαi antibody and Western blot analysis (Fig.6 B). When a similar co-immunoprecipitation experiment was performed with a liver cytosolic fraction (which is enriched in phosphorylated Gαi2), no co-immunoprecipitation of phosphorylated Gαi2 and actin was observed (data not shown). The intracellular distribution of Gαi2 and F-actin and the interaction between these proteins was further investigated using hepatocytes attached to collagen-coated coverslips, and Texas Red-X phalloidin and immunofluorescence to detect F-actin and Gαi2, respectively. In freshly isolated rat hepatocytes allowed to attach to coverslips for 0.5 h, F-actin was observed around the cortex, in both single hepatocytes and in hepatocyte doublets (Fig.7 A). When cultured for a further 3.5 h, the amount of F-actin in single cells and in doublets decreased in most regions of the cortex. In single cells, areas of high F-actin remained in some small regions of the cortex. In doublets, a pronounced concentration of"
