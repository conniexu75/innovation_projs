Interactive media now enable various degrees of digital immersion. The more a virtual immersive experience is based on design strategies that combine actional, symbolic, and sensory factors, the greater the participant's suspension of disbelief that she or he is “inside” a digitally enhanced setting. Studies have shown that immersion in a digital environment can enhance education in at least three ways: by allowing multiple perspectives, situated learning, and transfer. Further studies are needed on the capabilities of immersive media for learning, on the instructional designs best suited to each type of immersive medium, and on the learning strengths and preferences these media develop in users."
https://openalex.org/W2153122353,"The mammalian brain exhibits diverse types of neural plasticity, including activity-dependent neurogenesis in the adult hippocampus. How transient activation of mature neurons leads to long-lasting modulation of adult neurogenesis is unknown. Here we identify Gadd45b as a neural activity–induced immediate early gene in mature hippocampal neurons. Mice with Gadd45b deletion exhibit specific deficits in neural activity–induced proliferation of neural progenitors and dendritic growth of newborn neurons in the adult hippocampus. Mechanistically, Gadd45b is required for activity-induced DNA demethylation of specific promoters and expression of corresponding genes critical for adult neurogenesis, including brain-derived neurotrophic factor and fibroblast growth factor. Thus, Gadd45b links neuronal circuit activity to epigenetic DNA modification and expression of secreted factors in mature neurons for extrinsic modulation of neurogenesis in the adult brain."

In a study of migrating fibroblasts, Chaoliang Wei et al. have identified calcium flickers — high-calcium microdomains — as part of the mechanism that steers cells to their targets. The flickers are most active at the leading edge of migrating cells. In the presence of a chemotactic gradient, an asymmetric gradient of calcium flicker activity develops which promotes turning of cells towards the direction of the chemoattractant. Directional cell movement depends on an intracellular calcium gradient. This study identifies calcium flickers in migrating fibroblasts and these are most active at the leading edge of cells. In the presence of a chemotactic gradient, an asymmetric gradient of calcium flicker activity develops which promotes turning of cells towards the direction of the chemoattractant. Directional movement is a property common to all cell types during development and is critical to tissue remodelling and regeneration after damage1,2,3. In migrating cells, calcium has a multifunctional role in directional sensing, cytoskeleton redistribution, traction force generation, and relocation of focal adhesions1,4,5,6,7. Here we visualize high-calcium microdomains (‘calcium flickers’) and their patterned activation in migrating human embryonic lung fibroblasts. Calcium flicker activity is dually coupled to membrane tension (by means of TRPM7, a stretch-activated Ca2+-permeant channel of the transient receptor potential superfamily8) and chemoattractant signal transduction (by means of type 2 inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors). Interestingly, calcium flickers are most active at the leading lamella of migrating cells, displaying a 4:1 front-to-rear polarization opposite to the global calcium gradient6. When exposed to a platelet-derived growth factor gradient perpendicular to cell movement, asymmetric calcium flicker activity develops across the lamella and promotes the turning of migrating fibroblasts. These findings show how the exquisite spatiotemporal organization of calcium microdomains can orchestrate complex cellular processes such as cell migration."
https://openalex.org/W2033112320,"Hepatic lipid overloading mainly in the form of triglycerides is considered a prerequisite for the development of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). However, triglyceride accumulation in the liver in response to lipid overflow may represent a protective mechanism against lipotoxicity. Our aims were to assess the fundamental cellular mechanisms that link lipid compartmentation in hepatocytes to liver damage and disease progression in NAFLD by using both in vivo dietary models of NAFLD and in vitro cell models of lipid overloading. Exposure of murine or human hepatocytes to monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs) resulted in lipid accumulation without changes in cell viability. In contrast, cell incubation with saturated fatty acids (SFAs) significantly decreased cell viability and increased caspase activation and apoptosis, with only minor lipid droplet accumulation. Genetic or pharmacological inhibition of stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 (SCD1), the enzyme that converts SFA to MUFA, sensitized cells to SFA-induced apoptosis. Hepatic SCD1 expression increased in experimental steatosis resulting from high fat diet and decreased in a methionine-choline-deficient (MCD) dietary model of steatohepatitis resulting in the latter situation in significantly increased hepatic SFA levels. SCD1–/– mice on the MCD diet had decreased steatosis and markedly increased hepatocellular apoptosis, liver injury, and fibrosis compared with the SCD1+/+, whereas MUFA feeding prevents the MCD-induced injury. In conclusion, this study suggests hepatic SCD1 plays a key role in prevention of steatohepatitis by partitioning excess lipid into MUFA that can be safely stored. This concept has important implications for the development of novel treatment strategies for patients with this condition.

Feldstein A.E. Curr. Opin. Pediatr. 2005; 17: 636-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 2Angulo P. N. Engl. J. Med. 2002; 346: 1221-1231Crossref PubMed Scopus (4110) Google Scholar). One in three adults and one in ten children or adolescents in the United States have hepatic steatosis, a stage within the spectrum of NAFLD that is characterized by triglyceride accumulation in liver cells and follows a benign non-progressive clinical course. Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is defined as lipid accumulation with evidence of cellular damage, inflammation, and different degrees of scarring or fibrosis (3Brunt E.M. Neuschwander-Tetri B.A. Oliver D. Wehmeier K.R. Bacon B.R. Hum. Pathol. 2004; 35: 1070-1082Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). NASH is a serious condition as ∼25% of these patients progress to cirrhosis and its feared complications of portal hypertension, liver failure and hepatocellular carcinoma (4Adams L.A. Lymp J.F.

Thorelius L. Holmqvist M. Bodemar G. Kechagias S. Hepatology. 2006; 44: 865-873Crossref PubMed Scopus (1775) Google Scholar). The pathogenesis of NAFLD and NASH, and in particular the mechanisms responsible for liver injury and disease progression, remains poorly understood, but hepatic steatosis has been historically considered an initial event or the “first hit” in NAFLD development (7Diehl A.M. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 282: G1-G5Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 8Browning J.D. Horton J.D. J. Clin. Invest. 2004; 114: 147-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (1739) Google Scholar, 9Day C.P. James O.F. Gastroenterology. 1998; 114: 842-845Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3434) Google Scholar). This condition is postulated to increase sensitivity to a “second or multiple hits” that then trigger a cascade of events leading to cell death, inflammation, fibrogenesis, and fibrosis (8Browning J.D. Horton J.D. J. Clin. Invest. 2004; 114: 147-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (1739) Google Scholar). However, this linear progression “two hit” model suggests any second stimulus must be infrequent and variably interact with steatotic cells. These implications arise firstly from extensive evidence from natural history studies in humans showing that only a small proportion of individuals with hepatic steatosis demonstrate disease progression or develop liver-related complications (4Adams L.A. Lymp J.F. St. Sauver J. Sanderson S.O. Lindor K.D. Feldstein A. Angulo P. Gastroenterology. 2005; 129: 113-121Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2254) Google Scholar, 10Dam-Larsen S.

Christoffersen P. Larsen K. Becker U. Bendtsen F. Scand. J. Gastroenterol. 2005; 40: 460-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), and secondly, from recent epidemiological studies with serial liver biopsies on patients with NASH demonstrating that the degree of hepatic steatosis actually decreases in patients progressing to cirrhosis (12Clark J.M. Diehl A.M. J. Am. Med. Assoc. 2003; 289: 3000-3004Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). Steatosis and steatohepatitis can be modeled in mice by a high fat diet, or a diet deficient in methionine and choline, respectively. We noticed that in addition to the defining increase in triglyceride content in steatotic livers that there was an accompanying increase in free fatty acids (FFAs) and that the nature of FFA differed between the two models. The enzyme stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 (SCD1) regulates the partitioning of incoming saturated free fatty acids (SFAs) between the monounsaturated free fatty acids (MUFAs) found in steatotic livers and the SFA present in inflamed and fibrotic livers. Here we tested the hypothesis that the relative abundance of cytotoxic SFA, rather than the extent of steatosis reflecting triglyceride accumulation (13Listenberger L.L. Han X. Lewis S.E. Cases S.

Cell Lines and Culture—Hepatocytes were isolated from wild-type C57BL/6 male mice (Jackson Laboratories, Bar Harbor, ME), purified by Percoll gradient centrifugation, cultured as previously described (15Feldstein A.E.

Cells from a human, well differentiated hepatoblastoma cell line, HepG2, were cultured as previously described (17Feldstein A.E. Canbay A. Guicciardi M.E. Higuchi H. Bronk S.F. Gores G.J. J. Hepatol. 2003; 39: 978-983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar, 18Li Z. Berk M. McIntyre T.M. Gores G.J. Feldstein A.E. Hepatology. 2008; 47: 1495-1503Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Previous studies from our laboratory showed that these cells are sensitive to FFA-induced mitochondrial permeabilization and cytochrome c release in a dose- and time-dependent manner with kinetics comparable to those observed in primary mouse hepatocytes (19Feldstein A.E. Werneburg N.W. Canbay A. Guicciardi M.E. Bronk S.F. Rydzewski R. Burgart L.J. Gores G.J. Hepatology. 2004; 40: 185-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar). Cultured cells were treated with various concentrations (0.05–0.5 mm) of long chain FFA with different degrees of saturation, including palmitate and stearate (saturated), palmitoleate and oleate (one double bond), and linoleic (two double bonds) (Sigma) in media containing 1% bovine serum albumin for times ranging up to 24 h (0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, and 24 h). In selected experiments, cells were incubated with the fatty acid mixture in the presence or absence of the known SCD1 inhibitor trans-10,cis-12 isomer of conjugated linoleic acid (CLA, 45 μm, Matreya, LLC Biochemical, Pleasant Gap, PA) or a negative control (cis-9,trans-11 CLA, 45 μm, Matreya, LLC Biochemical) (20Ntambi J.M. Choi Y. Park Y. Peters J.M. Pariza M.W. Can. J. Appl. Physiol. 2002; 27: 617-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Cell Viability and Apoptosis Assessment—The number of viable cells was determined using a fluorometric assay (CellTiter-Blue, Promega, Madison, WI) following the manufacturer's instructions. Caspase activation and apoptosis were quantified using biochemical and fluorescent microscopic techniques: Caspase-Glo 3/7 Assay (Promega), the cell death ELISA kit (Roche Diagnostics), and assessing the characteristic nuclear changes of apoptosis (i.e. chromatin condensation and nuclear fragmentation) using the nuclear binding dye 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride (Molecular Probes Inc., Eugene, OR) and fluorescence microscopy. siRNA and Transfection—HepG2 cells were grown in 6-well plates and transiently transfected with 30 nm of pre-design SCD1 siRNA (Ambion) by using 8 μl of the siPORT NeoFXT-MTransfection Agent (Ambion) in a total transfection volume of 0.5 ml of Opti-MEM (Invitrogen). After incubation at 37 °C for 5 h, 1.5 ml of normal growth medium was added. Cells were used for experiments 48 h after transfection. Inhibition of SCD1 protein expression was assessed by immunoblot analysis. Nile Red Staining and Immunofluorescence—Isolated hepatocytes from C57BL/6 male mice were incubated with FFA (0.05–0.5 mm) in media with bovine serum albumin as a carrier for up to 4 h. Following fixation, cells were incubated with 0.1 μmol/ml of Nile Red in phosphate-buffered saline and examined by digitized fluorescence microscopy. Nile Red staining was expressed as an increase in total cellular fluorescence (pixel number per average fluorescence intensity) per cell. Immunoblot Analysis—Immunoblot analysis was performed using whole cell lysates. Samples were resolved by 12% SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membrane, and blotted with appropriate primary antibodies. The membrane was incubated with peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (1:10,000 dilution, BIOSOURCE International, Camarillo, CA), and the bound antibody was visualized using a chemiluminescent substrate (ECL, Amersham Biosciences) and Kodak X-Omat film (Eastman Kodak, Rochester, NY). Primary anti-SCD1 antibody (1:2,000 dilution, Abcam) and goat anti-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (1:2,000) were also used. Animal Studies—These experimental protocols were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the Cleveland Clinic. Male C57BL/6 mice, 20–25 g of body weight, were purchased from Jackson Laboratory. C57BL/6 SCD1 knockout (SCD1–/–, Jackson Laboratories) mice were described previously (21Ntambi J.M. Miyazaki M. Stoehr J.P. Lan H. Kendziorski C.M. Yandell B.S. Song Y. Cohen P. Friedman J.M. Attie A.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 11482-11486Crossref PubMed Scopus (876) Google Scholar). Mice were placed on two different diets that allow us to study the spectrum of human NAFLD. First, mice were fed a high fat (HFAT) diet (42% of kcal from fat, TD 88137, Teklad Mills, Madison, WI), which results in steatosis mainly due to increase delivery of exogenous fatty acids to the liver (22Koteish A. Diehl A.M. Semin. Liver Dis. 2001; 21: 89-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar, 23Nanji A.A. Clin. Liver Dis. 2004; 8: 559-574Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The second diet is a methionine and choline-deficient (MCD) diet (TD 90262, Teklad Mills), which has been extensively shown to result in steatosis associated with significant inflammation and progressive fibrosis pathologically similar to human severe steatohepatitis (24Dela Pena A. Leclercq I. Field J. George J. Jones B. Farrell G. Gastroenterology. 2005; 129: 1663-1674Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 25den Boer M. Voshol P.J. Kuipers F. Havekes L.M. Romijn J.A. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2004; 24: 644-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). In this later model steatosis results from both decreased mitochondrial oxidation of fatty acids and decreased export of fatty acids in the form of very low density lipoprotein (26London R.M. George J. Clin. Liver Dis. 2007; 11: 55-74Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Identical groups of animals (n = 6 in each group) received standard rodent chow to act as controls. In selective experiments, mice (n = 6) were fed a customized MCD diet in which the fat was supplemented entirely by oleate. Total body weight was measured weekly. Animals in each group were sacrificed after 6 weeks on respective diets. Determination of Liver Fibrosis—Liver fibrosis was quantified with Sirius Red. Direct Red 80 and Fast Green FCF (color index 42053) were provided by Sigma-Aldrich. Liver sections were incubated in the dark for 2 h at room temperature with an aqueous solution of saturated picric acid containing 0.1% Fast Green FCF and 0.1% Direct Red (27Canbay A. Guicciardi M.E. Higuchi H. Feldstein A. Bronk S.F. Rydzewski R. Taniai M. Gores G.J. J. Clin. Invest. 2003; 112: 152-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Stained slides were washed slowly under running distilled water for 6 min, dehydrated (3 min for each step), mounted, and examined by light microscopy. Red-stained collagen fibers were quantitated by digital image analysis. TUNEL Assay, Histopathology, and Serum Assays—Blood samples and liver tissue were collected under deep anesthesia after a 5-h fast as previously described in detail (17Feldstein A.E. Canbay A. Guicciardi M.E. Higuchi H. Bronk S.F. Gores G.J. J. Hepatol. 2003; 39: 978-983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Liver tissue was fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and embedded in Tissue Path (Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA). Tissue sections (4 μm) were prepared, and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) assay was performed following manufacturer's instructions (in situ cell death detection kit; Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Mannheim, Germany). Hepatocyte apoptosis in liver sections was quantitated by counting the number of TUNEL-positive cells in 10 random microscopic fields (20×), as previously described (28Feldstein A.E. Canbay A. Angulo P. Taniai M. Burgart L.J. Lindor K.D. Gores G.J. Gastroenterology. 2003; 125: 437-443Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (829) Google Scholar). Hematoxylin and eosin as well as Oil Red O-stained liver specimens were evaluated by light microscopy. The presence of 4-hydroxynonenal, a representative lipid peroxide product of oxidative stress was assessed by immunohistochemistry (4-hydroxynonenal, Cayman Chemicals). Serum alanine aminotransferase determinations were performed using a commercial kit (Sigma Diagnostics). Lipid Analyses—Fatty acid composition of liver tissues was measured by gas chromatography as described previously (29Chen C. Shah Y.M. Morimura K. Krausz K.W. Miyazaki M. Richardson T.A. Morgan E.T. Ntambi J.M. Idle J.R. Gonzalez F.J. Cell Metab. 2008; 7: 135-147Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 30Flowers J.B. Rabaglia M.E. Schueler K.L. Flowers M.T. Lan H. Keller M.P. Ntambi J.M. Attie A.D. Diabetes. 2007; 56: 1228-1239Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Data Analysis—All data are expressed as the mean ± S.D. unless otherwise indicated. Differences between groups were compared by an analysis of variance followed by a post hoc Bonferroni test to correct for multiple comparisons. Differences were considered to be statistically significant at p < 0.05. Viability and Lipid Storage Are Inversely Affected by Exogenous FFA—Lipid accumulation in hepatocytes is a critical event in NAFLD and is thought to be mainly a result of increased uptake of FFA from the circulation (31Donnelly K.L. Smith C.I. Schwarzenberg S.J. Jessurun J. Boldt M.D. Parks E.J. J. Clin. Invest. 2005; 115: 1343-1351Crossref PubMed Scopus (2352) Google Scholar, 32Postic C. Girard J. J. Clin. Invest. 2008; 118: 829-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (896) Google Scholar). We first recapitulated this environment by using isolated hepatocytes from C57BL/6 mice incubated with varied concentrations of specific FFA for up to 24 h. Triglyceride accumulation was assessed by Nile Red staining coupled to digitized fluorescence microscopy, whereas cell viability, caspase activation, and apoptosis were assessed using various biochemical and fluorescence microscopic approaches. Exposure of hepatocytes to the MUFA oleic acid resulted in significant accumulation of triglycerides (Fig. 1, A and B) without changes in cell viability, and with no detectable caspase 3 activation or apoptotic cell death (Fig. 1, C–F). In contrast, cells incubated with the SFA palmitate showed only a minor increase in lipid content that was accompanied by significant decrease in cell viability, increased caspase 3 activation, and apoptotic cell death (Fig. 1, A–F). Co-incubation with oleate completely rescued cells from palmitate-induced caspase activation, apoptosis, and restored triglyceride accumulation (Fig. 1, A–F). Similar results were found with other long-chain SFAs and MUFAs, such as stearate and palmitoleate (data not shown). SCD1 Is Rate-limiting in Detoxification of Exogenous SFA—SCD1 initiates SFA metabolism by catalyzing the conversion to MUFA. We next tested whether endogenous metabolism to oleate recapitulates the protection of exogenous oleate by either pharmacological or genetic inhibition of SCD1. We first evaluated apoptosis in FFA-treated cells in the presence or absence of a potent inhibitor of SCD1, 10,12-CLA. SCD1 inhibition significantly increased hepatocyte sensitivity to palmitate-induced apoptosis (Fig. 2A). To determine whether specific suppression of SCD1 expression had a similar effect, we used siRNA to silence SCD1 expression in HepG2 cells. By this approach, we reduced SCD1 expression to background levels (Fig. 2B). Cells transfected with the SCD1 siRNA showed a significant increase in apoptotic cell death after treatment with palmitate (Fig. 2C). Collectively, these data strongly suggest that SCD1 and the MUFA to SFA ratio in hepatocytes play a key role in protection from lipotoxicity in the context of FFA overloading. Hepatic SCD1 Expression and FFA Profiles Markedly Differ in Experimental Models of Hepatic Steatosis and Steatohepatitis—To investigate the role of SCD1 and lipid partitioning in liver injury and steatohepatitis development, we initially placed C57BL/6 mice on either a HFAT or a MCD diet. The first diet results in hepatic steatosis and several features of the human metabolic syndrome, including obesity, insulin resistance and dyslipidemia, but no evidence of any significant liver damage or inflammation (22Koteish A. Diehl A.M. Semin. Liver Dis. 2001; 21: 89-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar, 23Nanji A.A. Clin. Liver Dis. 2004; 8: 559-574Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The second diet results in progressive fibrosing steatohepatitis pathologically similar to human severe steatohepatitis (24Dela Pena A. Leclercq I. Field J. George J. Jones B. Farrell G. Gastroenterology. 2005; 129: 1663-1674Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 25den Boer M. Voshol P.J. Kuipers F. Havekes L.M. Romijn J.A. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2004; 24: 644-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). After 6 weeks on the respective diets we observed a significant increase in hepatic SCD1 expression in mice on the HFAT diet compared with those on the control diet (Fig. 3, A and B). In sharp contrast, mice on the MCD diet showed that SCD1 expression was significantly attenuated (Fig. 3, A and B). Both groups of animals on the diets developed hepatic steatosis, however they showed profound differences in their fatty acids profiles, with levels of SFA (palmitate (16:0) and stearate (18:0)) being significantly higher and those of MUFA (palmitoleate (16:1) and oleate (18:1)) being significantly lower in those mice on the MCD diet compared with those on the HFAT (Fig. 3, C and D). Thus, these data suggest a possible link between SCD1 activity and steatohepatitis development in vivo models of hepatic lipid overloading. Hepatic Lipid Partitioning and Hepatocellular Apoptosis in SCD1 Knockout Mice—The findings of a key role of SCD1 in maintaining hepatocyte viability in the context of FFA overflow and the strong correlation of hepatic SCD1 expression with liver injury led us to further examine the role of SCD1 in steatohepatitis by using SCD1-null mice. SCD1–/– mice and their wild-type controls were placed on the three different diets (HFAT, MCD, or control diets) for 6 weeks. SCD1 knockouts were resistant to HFAT diet-induced obesity consistent with previous reports (21Ntambi J.M. Miyazaki M. Stoehr J.P. Lan H. Kendziorski C.M. Yandell B.S. Song Y. Cohen P. Friedman J.M. Attie A.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 11482-11486Crossref PubMed Scopus (876) Google Scholar) and showed no evidence of hepatomegaly (Table 1) or liver histological changes (data not shown) compared with animals on the control diet. We next compared the two groups of animals on the MCD diet. SCD1–/– mice on the MCD diet had a significant reduction in hepatic steatosis compared with the wild-type animals on the same diet (Fig. 4). To determine if these changes in lipid partitioning in the liver were associated with an increase in liver cell apoptosis as we observed in cultured hepatocytes, we next quantified the amount of hepatocellular apoptosis present in the four groups of mice. TUNEL-positive hepatocytes were >2-fold greater in SCD1–/– on the MCD diet compared with SCD1+/+ mice on the same diet (Fig. 5, A and B).TABLE 1Body and liver weight in SCD1-/- and wild-type littermates after 6 weeks on the respective dietsBody weightLiver weightLiver/body weightgg%SCD1+/+ Control diet28 ± 1.21.1 ± 0.23.9 HFAT diet33 ± 1.52.7 ± 0.18 p value<0.01<0.01<0.01 MCD diet15 ± 1.10.9 ± 0.36 p value<0.01NSaNS, not significant.<0.05SCD1-/- Control diet24 ± 1.31.2 ± 0.24.6 HFAT diet26 ± 1.11.4 ± 0.25.4 p valueNSNSNS MCD diet13 ± 1.20.5 ± 0.33.9 p value<0.01<0.05NSa NS, not significant.

Although, as expected after 6 weeks, on the MCD diet wild-type animals developed signs of liver injury as shown by an increase in serum alanine aminotransferase levels (Fig. 6B) and 4-hydroxynonenal expression in the liver (Fig. 6A), these changes were significantly enhanced in the SCD1–/– mice. More importantly, an almost 2-fold increase in collagen deposition as demonstrated by Sirius Red staining of liver tissue coupled to quantitation by digitized image analysis was present in SCD1–/– mice on the MCD diet compared with the wild-type animals on the same diet (Fig. 6, C and D). Taken together, these observations suggest that, in the context of hepatic lipid overloading, SCD1 activity and, as a consequence, the balance between MUFA and SFA accumulating in liver cells play a central role in whether isolated hepatic steatosis or progressive steatohepatitis and fibrosis occurs. MCD Diet-induced Liver Injury Is Attenuated by MUFA Supplementation—To determined if exogenous supplementation of oleate could bypass the SCD-1 deficiency and in that way attenuate the MCD diet-induced apoptosis and liver damage, we generated a customized MCD diet in which the lipid component was completely replaced by this MUFA. The response of the high oleate MCD diet was compared with that of mice on the regular MCD diet or the control diet. After 6 weeks on the respective diets, MCD-induced apoptosis and liver injury were less severe in the high oleate MCD-fed animals compared with the animals on the regular MCD diet (Fig. 7, A–C). The principal findings of this study relate to the mechanisms linking hepatocyte lipid overloading, to hepatocellular apoptosis and liver injury. The results demonstrate that the ratio of MUFA to SFA determines whether liver cells are damaged by the flux of exogenous FFA, that the nature rather than the quantity of FFA determines hepatic stress, and that hepatic triglyceride storage and MUFA in this context are protective. Obesity and type 2 diabetes have reached epidemic proportions in most of the western world, and both conditions are strongly associated with NAFLD (33Clark J.M. Brancati F.L. Diehl A.M. Gastroenterology. 2002; 122: 1649-1657Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (761) Google Scholar). NAFLD encompasses a wide spectrum of conditions associated with over-accumulation of lipids in the liver ranging from simple fatty liver or hepatic steatosis, in which there is evidence for fat accumulation without signs of liver cell injury or inflammation, to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis or NASH characterized by the accumulation of fat in the liver along with evidence of liver cell damage, inflammation, and different degrees of scarring or fibrosis (2Angulo P. N. Engl. J. Med. 2002; 346: 1221-1231Crossref PubMed Scopus (4110) Google Scholar). Although most patients with steatosis tend to have a benign nonprogressive clinical course, a significant proportion of those with NASH have a progressive disease with significant associated risk of developing cirrhosis and its feared complications of portal hypertension, liver failure, and hepatocellular carcinoma (4Adams L.A.

A net retention of triglycerides in hepatocytes to form large cytosolic lipid droplets has been historically considered a prerequisite and the “first hit” in the development of NAFLD. The mechanisms that link hepatic steatosis to liver damage resulting in disease progression to NASH and NASH-cirrhosis have been the center of extensive investigation and remain incompletely understood. A central question is why most patients with hepatic steatosis have a benign nonprogressive disease while others develop steatohepatitis and end-stage liver disease. Lipids accumulate in the form of triglycerides in the context of lipid overloading of the liver, but steatosis is associated with an excess of a variety of FFA and cholesterol (34McClain C.J. Barve S. Deaciuc I. Hepatology. 2007; 45: 1343-1346Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 35Mari M. Caballero F. Colell A. Morales A. Caballeria J. Fernandez A. Enrich C. Fernandez-Checa J.C.

SCD1 catalyzes the desaturation of SFA palmitate and stearate to the MUFA palmitoleate and oleate, respectively, and recently, has been implicated in the development of diet-induced obesity and insulin resistance (21Ntambi J.M.

SCD1 knockout mice are resistant to high fat diet-induced obesity, whereas antisense oligonucleotide inhibition of SCD1 protected against diet-induced insulin resistance and obesity. However, other studies suggest hepatic SCD1 activity may maintain metabolic homeostasis and prevent inflammation (29Chen C. Shah Y.M. Morimura K. Krausz K.W. Miyazaki M. Richardson T.A. Morgan E.T. Ntambi J.M. Idle J.R. Gonzalez F.J. Cell Metab. 2008; 7: 135-147Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 30Flowers J.B. Rabaglia M.E. Schueler K.L. Flowers M.T. Lan H. Keller M.P. Ntambi J.M. Attie A.D. Diabetes. 2007; 56: 1228-1239Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Our in vitro studies showed that SCD1 protected hepatocytes from apoptotic cell death in the context of FFA overflow. We have previously demonstrated that exposing cultured hepatocytes to SFA, but not to mono- or polyunsaturated FFA, initiates a time- and dose-dependent permeabilization of the mitochondrial outer membrane, with release of cytochrome c, caspase 3 activation, and apoptosis. We hypothesize that SCD1 protection is through channeling these SFAs into MUFAs, which are then more easily incorporated into triglycerides and then safely stored in lipid droplets. This is supported by the fact that incubation with palmitate resulted in only minor increases in the triglyceride pool, whereas co-incubation with oleate completely prevented palmitate toxicity and increased the triglyceride pool to a similar extent to that seen in cells incubated with oleate alone. The in vitro observations can be extrapolated to in vivo hepatic lipid overloading because feeding mice a high fat diet, which results in extensive steatosis without apoptotic cell death, hepatocellular injury, or fibrosis, is associated with significantly increased hepatocyte SCD1 expression and a major increase in the MUFA to SFA ratio. In sharp contrast, feeding mice an MCD diet, that has been extensively associated with fibrosing steatohepatitis similar to that seen in patients with severe NASH, reversed the changes in the desaturation index. To further examine the role of SCD1 in lipid-mediated cytotoxicity in vivo we utilized SCD1-null mice. When we placed the SCD1–/– on an MCD diet, the mice accumulated less triglyceride in the liver compared with the wild-type animals on the same diet, the SCD1–/– mice also showed a pronounced decreased in the desaturation index that was accompanied by an increase in hepatocellular apoptosis and liver injury. Finally, the MCD diet-induced liver toxicity could by partially prevented by feeding mice a high oleate MCD diet. These results demonstrate that hepatic SCD1 deficiency and the desaturation index of hepatic FFA play a key role in development of steatohepatitis in the context of lipid overload in the liver, which is characteristic of patients with NAFLD. This concept has important implications for the pathogenesis and development of novel diagnostic and treatment strategies for NAFLD and at the same time alerts about the potential negative consequences to the liver of pharmacological inhibition of SCD1 for treatment of obesity and insulin resistance as a significant proportion of patients with these conditions also suffers from NAFLD. In summary, the current studies uncover a pathogenic link between hepatic lipid metabolism and liver injury in the context of fat overloading of the liver. The results support a model (Fig. 8) in which, during the development of NAFLD, overflow of FFA to the liver is associated with an increase in SCD1 expression and activity resulting in a tilt of the balance toward MUFA formation, triglyceride storage, liver adaptation, and development of isolated hepatic steatosis. In contrast, SCD1 deficiency results in hepatic over-accumulation of SFA and a decreased desaturation index triggering hepatocellular apoptosis, liver damage, and development of steatohepatitis."

https://openalex.org/W1965892231,"Retinoic acid inducible–gene I (RIG-I) is a cytosolic multidomain protein that detects viral RNA and elicits an antiviral immune response. Two N-terminal caspase activation and recruitment domains (CARDs) transmit the signal, and the regulatory domain prevents signaling in the absence of viral RNA. 5′-triphosphate and double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) are two molecular patterns that enable RIG-I to discriminate pathogenic from self-RNA. However, the function of the DExH box helicase domain that is also required for activity is less clear. Using single-molecule protein-induced fluorescence enhancement, we discovered a robust adenosine 5′-triphosphate–powered dsRNA translocation activity of RIG-I. The CARDs dramatically suppress translocation in the absence of 5′-triphosphate, and the activation by 5′-triphosphate triggers RIG-I to translocate preferentially on dsRNA in cis. This functional integration of two RNA molecular patterns may provide a means to specifically sense and counteract replicating viruses."
https://openalex.org/W1994362040,"The crystal structure of a complex between the cell surface receptor protein Fas and the Fas-associated death domain (FADD) protein - a central feature of the so-called death-inducing signalling complex of apoptosis-inducing cellular receptors - has been determined at 2.7 Å resolution. The structure reveals a previously unknown type of death domain interaction that allows four FADD and four Fas proteins to aggregate in the one complex. Surprisingly, a conformational change opens up the Fas death domain, which creates binding surfaces for FADD as well as Fas-Fas 'bridging' interactions. Only when a sufficient number of Fas molecules are in close proximity - as is the case when Fas ligand binds - can the open form of Fas be stabilized. This study presents the crystal structure of a Fas-FADD complex, a central feature of the so-called death inducing signalling complex. The structure reveals a new mode of death domain interactions that allows four FADD and four Fas proteins in one complex. The death inducing signalling complex (DISC) formed by Fas receptor, FADD (Fas-associated death domain protein) and caspase 8 is a pivotal trigger of apoptosis1,2,3. The Fas–FADD DISC represents a receptor platform, which once assembled initiates the induction of programmed cell death. A highly oligomeric network of homotypic protein interactions comprised of the death domains of Fas and FADD is at the centre of DISC formation4,5. Thus, characterizing the mechanistic basis for the Fas–FADD interaction is crucial for understanding DISC signalling but has remained unclear largely because of a lack of structural data. We have successfully formed and isolated the human Fas–FADD death domain complex and report the 2.7 Å crystal structure. The complex shows a tetrameric arrangement of four FADD death domains bound to four Fas death domains. We show that an opening of the Fas death domain exposes the FADD binding site and simultaneously generates a Fas–Fas bridge. The result is a regulatory Fas–FADD complex bridge governed by weak protein–protein interactions revealing a model where the complex itself functions as a mechanistic switch. This switch prevents accidental DISC assembly, yet allows for highly processive DISC formation and clustering upon a sufficient stimulus. In addition to depicting a previously unknown mode of death domain interactions, these results further uncover a mechanism for receptor signalling solely by oligomerization and clustering events."

A pressing social problem is the prevalence of violent video games, leading to desensitization, aggressive behavior, and gender inequity in opportunities to develop visual-spatial skills. Formal education must adapt to these changes, taking advantage of new strengths in visual-spatial intelligence and compensating for new weaknesses in higher-order cognitive processes: abstract vocabulary, mindfulness, reflection, inductive problem solving, critical thinking, and imagination. These develop through the use of an older technology, reading, which, along with audio media such as radio, also stimulates imagination.

https://openalex.org/W2081024860,"A subset of retinal ganglion cells has recently been discovered to be intrinsically photosensitive, with melanopsin as the pigment. These cells project primarily to brain centres for non-image-forming visual functions such as the pupillary light reflex and circadian photoentrainment. How well they signal intrinsic light absorption to drive behaviour remains unclear. Here we report fundamental parameters governing their intrinsic light responses and associated spike generation. The membrane density of melanopsin is 10(4)-fold lower than that of rod and cone pigments, resulting in a very low photon catch and a phototransducing role only in relatively bright light. Nonetheless, each captured photon elicits a large and extraordinarily prolonged response, with a unique shape among known photoreceptors. Notably, like rods, these cells are capable of signalling single-photon absorption. A flash causing a few hundred isomerized melanopsin molecules in a retina is sufficient for reaching threshold for the pupillary light reflex."

We show that a member of the low-density receptor-related protein family, Lrp4 modulates and integrates Bmp and canonical Wnt signalling during tooth morphogenesis by binding the secreted Bmp antagonist protein Wise. Mouse mutants of Lrp4 and Wise exhibit identical tooth phenotypes that include supernumerary incisors and molars, and fused molars. We propose that the Lrp4/Wise interaction acts as an extracellular integrator of epithelial-mesenchymal cell signaling. Wise, secreted from mesenchyme cells binds to BMP's and also to Lrp4 that is expressed on epithelial cells. This binding then results in the modulation of Wnt activity in the epithelial cells. Thus in this context Wise acts as an extracellular signaling molecule linking two signaling pathways. We further show that a downstream mediator of this integration is the Shh signaling pathway."

In contrast to this model, we cannot detect N-cadherin expression by HSCs, and most HSCs do not localize to the endosteal surface. It has nonetheless been suggested that HSCs express low levels of N-cadherin that regulate HSC maintenance. To test this, we conditionally deleted N-cadherin from HSCs and other hematopoietic cells in adult Mx-1-Cre+N-cadherinfl/− mice. N-cadherin deficiency had no detectable effect on HSC maintenance or hematopoiesis. N-cadherin deficiency did not affect bone marrow cellularity or lineage composition, the numbers of colony-forming progenitors, the frequency of HSCs, the ability of HSCs to sustain hematopoiesis over time, or their ability to reconstitute irradiated mice in primary or secondary transplants. Loss of N-cadherin does not lead to HSC depletion. N-cadherin expression by HSCs is not necessary for niche function."

RPA serves as an auxiliary factor for DNA polymerase-α (pol-α)·primase: it stabilizes the protein complex by direct interaction with both pol-α and primase subunits, and it reduces the misincorporation rate of pol-α, acting as a “fidelity clamp” (5Frick D.N.

The pol-α·primase complex consists of four subunits, including the catalytic pol-α subunit (p185), a regulatory B subunit (p70), and two primase subunits (p49 and p58). On an ssDNA template, the primase synthesizes short RNA primers from ribonucleoside triphosphates (rNTPs), which are elongated by pol-α in the presence of deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates (dNTPs) to form short DNA fragments. Through mechanisms requiring other replication factors, pol-α·primase is replaced by the more processive DNA polymerases pol-δ and pol-∊ (7Burgers, P. M. (October 3, 2008) J. Biol. Chem. 10.1074/jbc.R800062200Google Scholar). Pol-∊ synthesizes the leading strand, whereas pol-δ completes each Okazaki fragment initiated by pol-α·primase on the lagging strand and proofreads errors made by pol-α (7Burgers, P. M. (October 3, 2008) J. Biol. Chem. 10.1074/jbc.R800062200Google Scholar).

In addition to initiating DNA replication and synthesizing Okazaki fragments, it appears to be one of the final targets of cell cycle checkpoint pathways that couple DNA replication to DNA damage response (2Garg P.

Burgers P.M. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2005; 40: 115-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). In the course of purifying pol-α·primase from extracts of cultured mouse L1210 cells, we identified a factor we named α-accessory factor (AAF) that stimulates pol-α·primase activity in vitro (10Goulian M. Heard C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 19407-19415Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Goulian M. Heard C.J. Grimm S.L. J. Biol.

The protein has a native molecular mass of ∼150 kDa as determined from its sedimentation coefficient and Stokes radius and is composed of two subunits of ∼132 and ∼44 kDa. AAF stimulates pol-α·primase activity with several different templates and types of reactions: (i) It stimulates selfprimed reactions with poly(dT), poly(dI·dT), or single-stranded circular DNA; (ii) it stimulates primed reactions with poly(dA)·oligo(dT) and multiply primed DNA in the absence of rNTPs, indicating that it affects pol-α activity when no primers are being made; and (iii) it stimulates primase activity on ssDNA in the absence of dNTPs, showing that it can enhance RNA primer synthesis in the absence of DNA synthesis (11Goulian M. Heard C.J. Grimm S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 13221-13230Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). AAF increases the template affinity and processivity of pol-α·primase (12Goulian M. Heard C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 13231-13239Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). AAF is highly specific for pol-α·primase and has no effect on the other mammalian DNA polymerases β, γ, or δ or on the DNA polymerase·primase complexes from Drosophila and Saccharomyces cerevisiae (11Goulian M. Heard C.J. Grimm S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 13221-13230Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The cloning of both AAF subunits based on peptide sequences obtained from the purified protein allowed us now to further characterize the AAF-44·AAF-132 complex structurally and functionally. Based on siRNA experiments in cancer cell lines, AAF appears to regulate DNA replication in vivo. Purification of AAF and Sequencing of Tryptic Peptides—AAF was purified from 80 g of cultured mouse L1210 lymphoblastic cells as described previously, and its activity was measured following stimulation of pol-α·primase on unprimed poly(dT) using 0.1 unit of purified pol-α·primase (11Goulian M. Heard C.J. Grimm S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 13221-13230Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fractions from the S-300 column (step V) containing AAF activity were pooled, concentrated, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and the 132- and 44-kDa subunit bands were excised and sent to the W. M. Keck Foundation Biotechnology Resource Laboratory at Yale University. Individual tryptic peptides were separated by reverse phase high pressure liquid chromatography and sequenced by mass spectrometry using an electrospray/quadrupole/time-of-flight spectrometer. The N terminus of the 44-kDa band was sequenced by the University of California San Diego Biology Department Protein Sequencing Facility, but the N terminus of AAF-132 was found to be blocked. cDNA Cloning of AAF-132 and AAF-44—Peptide sequences were used to search available data bases with the BLAST program (13Altschul S.F.

Biol. 2003; 23: 4066-4082Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) and used to screen an oligo(dT)-primed mouse testis cDNA library in λGT10 (Stratagene). Two overlapping AAF-132 clones were isolated that encoded an uninterrupted open reading frame of 1199 amino acids including the 3′-end but were missing a proper start codon. To clone the 5′-end of both AAF-132 and AAF-44, we used rapid amplification of cDNA 5′-ends (15Frohman M.A. Dush M.K. Martin G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 8998-9002Crossref PubMed Scopus (4314) Google Scholar) with L1210 RNA serving as a template. The gene-specific primers for AAF-132 were 5′-CTTTGGGTCAAAAGTAGCCCAAGCC-3′ and 5′-TCGGAGGTAGGTGGTTCGCCC-3′. The primers for AAF-44 were 5′-TCGGATGATATCTCCAATCCC-3′ and 5′-TCTGCTCGATGGTCTCCTGC-3′. For each subunit, two independent PCR products were sequenced. Northern Blot Analyses—Mouse tissue Northern blots (Clontech) were hybridized with cDNA probes encoding murine AAF-44 (nucleotides 164-544), AAF-132 (nucleotides 3401-3692), or human β-actin (Clontech) as described previously (14Chen Y.

Probes were generated by PCR and labeled by random hexamer priming using either [α-32PO4]dCTP (AAF-132 and β-actin) or both [α-32PO4]dCTP and [α-32PO4]dATP (AAF-44). In Vitro Transcription/Translation of Epitope-tagged AAF-44 and AAF-132—5′ fusion sites were created using PCR and the following sets of primers: 5′-GGATCCATGGCTGCTTGCCGAGCACAAC-3′ and 5′-CTTTGGGTCAAAAGTAGCCCAAGCC-3′for AAF-132 and 5′-CTCGAGGAGATGCCACAGCCCTGCCTCTTG-3′ and 5′-TCTGCTCGATGGTCTCCTGC-3′ for AAF-44. The PCR products were sequenced and spliced into the full-length coding sequences in pcDNA3-Myc, pcDNA3-HA, or pXJ40-FLAG, creating an in-frame fusion with an N-terminal Myc, hemagglutinin (HA), or FLAG epitope tag (16Casteel D.E.

AAF-44 and/or AAF-132 in pcDNA3-Myc was used as a template for a coupled transcription/translation reaction using T7 RNA polymerase, [35S]methionine, and the TnT™ reticulocyte lysate system according to the manufacturer's instructions (Promega). Site-directed Mutagenesis—Site-directed mutagenesis of AAF-44 was performed using the QuikChange™ mutagenesis II XL kit from Stratagene with the following primers (sense strand with mutant nucleotides is underlined): 5′-GTTATAAACTGCGTCTGCGCAAAGAAGCTGAGCAAC-3′ (W96A) and 5′-GTCCGAGGCTCTGTGCGTATGGCCCGAGAAGAGCGAGA-G-3′ (F151A). The mutagenesis product was sequenced. Cell Culture—Cells were grown in the following media: human embryonal kidney 293T cells in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium, MDA-MB-231 and MCF7 breast cancer cells in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 medium, PC3 prostate cancer cells in RPMI 1640 medium, and HeLa cervical cancer cells in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. All media were supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) unless otherwise specified. DNA Transfections and Co-immunoprecipitation Experiments—239T cells were transfected in full growth medium with 2 μg of DNA and 5 μl of Lipofectamine 2000™/6-well cluster dish. Cells were lysed 24 h later in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, and protease inhibitor mixture (Calbiochem) for 10 min at 4 °C. The lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 10 min, and a monoclonal mouse anti-HA epitope antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, SC7392) or a polyclonal rabbit anti-Myc antibody (SC789) were added (16Casteel D.E.

Immunoprecipitates were collected on protein G-agarose, washed six times in lysis buffer, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE/Western blotting (16Casteel D.E. Zhuang S. Gudi T. Tang J. Vuica M. Desiderio S.

Immunoaffinity Purification of AAF-44—239T cells were transfected with an expression vector encoding FLAG epitope-tagged AAF-44 and either Myc-tagged AAF-132 or empty vector as described above. Cells were lysed in buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 0.3% Nonidet P-40, and protease inhibitor mixture; cleared lysates were incubated with anti-FLAG M2-agarose beads (Sigma) for 1 h. The beads were washed six times in lysis buffer, and AAF-44 was eluted in buffer containing 0.03% Nonidet P-40 and 0.1 mg/ml FLAG peptide (Sigma). DNA Binding Assay—For DNA binding assays, cells were transfected as described above, and 20-200 μg of cell lysate protein were incubated for 20 min at 4 °C in binding buffer (10 mm K-HEPES, pH 7.9, 25 mm KCl, 0.25 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 5% glycerol) with 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin and the indicated amount of biotinylated (dC)30 oligodeoxyribonucleotide (oligo(dC); Invitrogen) in a total volume of 70 μl. In some experiments, cell lysates were preincubated with non-biotinylated oligo(dC)30 for 15 min prior to addition of biotinylated probe. Streptavidin-agarose beads (Thermo Scientific) were added for an additional 20 min, the beads were washed three times in binding buffer with 0.1% Triton X-100, and bound proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE/Western blotting using the appropriate anti-epitope antibody. Primer-dependent DNA Synthesis Assay—Oligoribonucleotides synthesized by purified pol-α·primase were assayed by measuring their ability to serve as primers for the Escherichia coli pol I Klenow fragment. The four-subunit DNA pol-α·primase complex was immunoaffinity-purified from human leukemic myeloblasts or calf thymus using SJK132-20 antibody as described previously (18Perrino F.W. Loeb L.A. J.

Chem. 1989; 264: 2898-2905Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To this assay were added variable amounts of immunoaffinity-purified AAF-44·AAF-132 complex or AAF-44 purified in the absence of AAF-132; FLAG elution buffer served as a control. After a 15-min incubation at 37 °C, acid-insoluble radioactivity was collected on glass fiber filters and quantified by scintillation counting. Immunofluorescence Studies—HeLa cells were plated on glass coverslips and 16-20 h later were transfected with vectors encoding epitope-tagged AAF-44 or AAF-132 using Lipofectamine 2000. Cells were transferred to serum-free medium for 48 h and then treated with 10 μg/ml aphidicolin (Sigma) in 10% serum-containing medium for an additional 24 h to stimulate them to reach the G1/S border. To release the aphidicolin block, cells were washed three times and incubated in complete growth medium to allow semisynchronous progression through S phase (20Dimitrova D.S. Berezney R. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 4037-4051Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). At the indicated times, cells were fixed in methanol at -20 °C, permeabilized in 0.1% Triton X-100, and stained with antibodies specific for proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and Myc or HA epitopes as described previously (16Casteel D.E.

After 20 h, they were plated at 7 × 104 cells/well in 24-well dishes and transferred to media containing either 10% dialyzed FBS or 0.5% FBS for 24 h prior to incubation with 5 μCi/ml [methyl-3H]thymidine (PerkinElmer Life Sciences; 20 Ci/mmol) for 4 h. Cells were lysed in 0.1% SDS and 0.1 n NaOH, nucleic acids were precipitated in 10% trichloroacetic acid, and precipitates were collected on glass fiber filters; radioactivity was quantified by liquid scintillation counting. The assay was linear with time and cell number. The target sequences for AAF-44 siRNAs were 1) 5′-UGGAUCCUGUGUUUCUAGCCU-3′ and 2) 5′-CAGCUUAACCUCACAACUUAA-3′; siRNA oligoribonucleotides were synthesized by Qiagen, including the AllStars Negative Control siRNA (1027281). A second control siRNA was from Dharmacon and was targeted at green fluorescent protein (GFP; D-001300-01). Quantitative Reverse Transcription-PCR—One microgram of total cytoplasmic RNA was subjected to reverse transcription with random hexamer primers, and quantitative PCR was performed using an Mx3000 real time PCR detection system (Stratagene) with IQ™ SYBR Green Supermix (Bio-Rad) (22Zeng Y. Zhuang S. Gloddek J. Tseng C.C. Boss G.R. Pilz R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 16951-16961Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The following primers were used: 5′-GACCAGCCTTTTCACAGCTC-3′ (AAF-44, sense) and 5′-GCAAGGGACAGCAAAGACTC-3′ (AAF-44, antisense) and 5′-AACGGATTTGGTCGTATTGGG-3′ (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, sense) and 5′-TGGAGGATGGTGATGGGATTTC-3′ (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, antisense). Relative changes in mRNA expression were calculated with glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase serving as an internal reference (22Zeng Y. Zhuang S. Gloddek J. Tseng C.C. Boss G.R. Pilz R.B. J.

Data Presentation—Results presented in bar graphs represent the means ± S.E. of at least three independent experiments performed in duplicate. Student's t test was used for pairwise comparisons; a p value of <0.05 was considered to indicate statistical significance. Purification and Peptide Sequencing of AAF-132 and AAF-44 Subunits—AAF was purified from L1210 murine lymphoblasts through phosphocellulose, hydroxylapatite, DNA cellulose, and gel filtration chromatography (11Goulian M. Heard C.J. Grimm S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 13221-13230Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Amino acid sequences from several internal peptides of the 132- and 44-kDa subunits were obtained by tandem mass spectrometry; in addition, Edman degradation resulted in an N-terminal sequence of the small subunit (Table 1).TABLE 1Tryptic peptides of AAF-132 and AAF-44 and an N-terminal peptide of AAF-44Identified as amino acid residuesAAF-132 peptide fragments1 GGRPGDGVLPR98-1082 QLILLGTLVDLLGDSEQE110-1273 AWATFDPK561-5684 LVAPGPSTPVFETEGSSGT814-8325 XHFSQLEK962-9686 ALGLSPSEWSSILEHAR1090-11067 VALQFTGLGGQTXSASK1111-11278 THEPLTLLLR1128-11379 PTDISPR1159-1165AAF-44 peptide fragments1 PQPXLXME2-92 IGIGDIIR136-1433 XIXANIYYK157-1644 XDDPVWNMQIAR166-1765 LQEEEALNNKDNLDLAGLTSLLSEK197-2216 VLELLEDQSDIVSTADHYY357-375 Open table in a new tab cDNA Cloning and Genomic Organization of AAF-132—Data base searches with the BLAST program (13Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (68351) Google Scholar) yielded a single EST-based nucleotide sequence comprising peptides 7 and 8 of AAF-132 (Table 1) (GenBank accession number AA655197). We used this sequence to isolate two overlapping clones from a mouse cDNA library, and we used rapid amplification of cDNA 5′-ends (15Frohman M.A. Dush M.K. Martin G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 8998-9002Crossref PubMed Scopus (4314) Google Scholar) to extend the open reading frame to a total of 1211 amino acids. The first methionine is in the context of a good Kozak sequence and is preceded by 41 presumably untranslated nucleotides. The open reading frame contains the exact amino acid sequences of all nine tryptic peptides derived from purified AAF-132 (Table 1), and the calculated molecular weight for the encoded protein is 133,917, which is in good agreement with the apparent molecular weight observed on SDS-PAGE (11Goulian M. Heard C.J. Grimm S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 13221-13230Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After completion of the above described work, full-length cDNA clones of unidentified proteins became available through the NCBI data bases; clones NM_026889 and NM_025099 encode murine and human AAF-132, respectively, which share 69% amino acid sequence identity (GenBank accession numbers of AAF sequences are summarized in supplemental Table I). Several minor sequence differences between the two murine cDNAs are listed in supplemental Table II; most differences did not result in amino acid changes, but in three of four cases where it did, our sequence corresponds to amino acids found in the human protein. Two genomic clones from mouse chromosome 11 demonstrate that the AAF-132 gene contains 23 exons spanning 15 kb. Several mouse EST clones were found that encode exons I and II and extend the 5′-untranslated region to a total of 208-222 nucleotides (supplemental Table I provides a list of the EST and genomic clones). cDNA Cloning and Genomic Organization of AAF-44—BLAST searches with the peptide sequences obtained for AAF-44 yielded an EST clone containing perfect matches for peptides 2-6 of AAF-44 (GenBank accession number AA039012) (Table 1). Rapid amplification of cDNA 5′-ends extended the open reading frame to a total of 378 amino acids (calculated molecular weight, 43,482), including peptide 1 obtained from the N-terminal sequencing of AAF-44 (Table 1); the latter included 197 nucleotides of the 5′-untranslated region with a termination codon upstream and in-frame with the ATG. Two genomic clones from mouse chromosome 19 (supplemental Table I) show that the AAF-44 gene contains 10 exons over a distance of 36 kb. Recently BLAST searches also identified a full-length cDNA clone encoding murine AAF-44 (GenBank accession number NM_175360); compared with our sequence, this clone contains one nucleotide change but identical amino acid sequence and 229 nucleotides of 5′-untranslated region. Three EST clones were found that extend further 5′ (corresponding to the genomic sequence); these clones suggest that the 5′-untranslated region may be unusually long, consisting of 327-349 nucleotides (supplemental Table I provides accession numbers). Based on a human cDNA sequence, human and murine AAF-44 share 71% amino acid sequence identity. AAF mRNA Analysis—Using probes encoding parts of AAF-132 or AAF-44 coding sequences, we performed Northern blot analysis of poly(A)+ RNA from adult mouse tissues and found single messenger RNA species of ∼4 and 2 kb for AAF-132 and AAF-44, respectively (Fig. 1A). The sizes of the mRNAs correspond approximately to the length of their cDNAs (4 and 1.9 kb for AAF-132 and -44, respectively). The amount of AAF-44 message was low but correlated with the amount of AAF-132 mRNA with highest levels (compared with β-actin) found in testis and undetectable levels in skeletal muscle. Expression of Epitope-tagged AAF-44 and AAF-132 Proteins—In vitro transcription and translation of cDNAs encoding Myc epitope-tagged versions of AAF-44 and/or AAF-132 yielded products with apparent molecular masses corresponding to those of the native AAF subunits, and [35S]methionine-labeled proteins reacted with antibodies directed against the Myc epitope (Fig. 1B; the Myc epitope increases the apparent molecular weight). We observed high levels of the 44-kDa subunit but lower levels of the 132-kDa subunit in 293T cells transfected with expression vectors encoding Myc-tagged AAF-44 and/or AAF-132 (Fig. 1C). Co-expression of AAF-44 always improved recovery of the large subunit, whereas storing samples at 4, -20, or -80 °C caused dramatic losses of the 132-kDa protein. The 132-kDa subunit generally migrated as a blurry band, suggesting the presence of post-translational modification(s). In addition, variable amounts of high molecular weight protein aggregates were observed at the top of the gel (marked with an asterisk in Fig. 1C). This was also observed during AAF purification where a portion of AAF-132 appeared to form large aggregates that migrated only a short distance on SDS-PAGE (11Goulian M. Heard C.J. Grimm S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 13221-13230Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Co-immunoprecipitation of AAF-132 and AAF-44 from Intact Cells—To determine whether the two AAF proteins associate in intact cells, 293T cells were transfected with vectors encoding Myc epitope-tagged AAF-132 and/or HA-tagged AAF-44. When AAF-132 was immunoprecipitated from lysates of cells co-expressing both proteins, AAF-44 was found in the immunoprecipitates, but n"
https://openalex.org/W1966087112,"Pyrrolysine (Pyl), the 22nd natural amino acid, is genetically encoded by UAG and inserted into proteins by the unique suppressor tRNA(Pyl) (ref. 1). The Methanosarcinaceae produce Pyl and express Pyl-containing methyltransferases that allow growth on methylamines. Homologous methyltransferases and the Pyl biosynthetic and coding machinery are also found in two bacterial species. Pyl coding is maintained by pyrrolysyl-tRNA synthetase (PylRS), which catalyses the formation of Pyl-tRNA(Pyl) (refs 4, 5). Pyl is not a recent addition to the genetic code. PylRS was already present in the last universal common ancestor; it then persisted in organisms that utilize methylamines as energy sources. Recent protein engineering efforts added non-canonical amino acids to the genetic code. This technology relies on the directed evolution of an 'orthogonal' tRNA synthetase-tRNA pair in which an engineered aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase (aaRS) specifically and exclusively acylates the orthogonal tRNA with a non-canonical amino acid. For Pyl the natural evolutionary process developed such a system some 3 billion years ago. When transformed into Escherichia coli, Methanosarcina barkeri PylRS and tRNA(Pyl) function as an orthogonal pair in vivo. Here we show that Desulfitobacterium hafniense PylRS-tRNA(Pyl) is an orthogonal pair in vitro and in vivo, and present the crystal structure of this orthogonal pair. The ancient emergence of PylRS-tRNA(Pyl) allowed the evolution of unique structural features in both the protein and the tRNA. These structural elements manifest an intricate, specialized aaRS-tRNA interaction surface that is highly distinct from those observed in any other known aaRS-tRNA complex; it is this general property that underlies the molecular basis of orthogonality."

Although many of the effects of FTY720 are ascribed to its phosphorylation and subsequent sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P)-like action through S1P1,3–5 receptors, studies on modulation of intracellular balance of signaling sphingolipids by FTY720 are limited. In this study, we used stable isotope pulse labeling of human pulmonary artery endothelial cells with l-[U-13C, 15N]serine as well as in vitro enzymatic assays and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry methodology to characterize FTY720 interference with sphingolipid de novo biosynthesis. In human pulmonary artery endothelial cells, FTY720 inhibited ceramide synthases, resulting in decreased cellular levels of dihydroceramides, ceramides, sphingosine, and S1P but increased levels of dihydrosphingosine and dihydrosphingosine 1-phosphate (DHS1P). The FTY720-induced modulation of sphingolipid de novo biosynthesis was similar to that of fumonisin B1, a classical inhibitor of ceramide synthases, but differed in the efficiency to inhibit biosynthesis of short-chain versus long-chain ceramides. In vitro kinetic studies revealed that FTY720 is a competitive inhibitor of ceramide synthase 2 toward dihydrosphingosine with an apparent Ki of 2.15 μm. FTY720-induced up-regulation of DHS1P level was mediated by sphingosine kinase (SphK) 1, but not SphK2, as confirmed by experiments using SphK1/2 silencing with small interfering RNA. Our data demonstrate for the first time the ability of FTY720 to inhibit ceramide synthases and modulate the intracellular balance of signaling sphingolipids. These findings open a novel direction for therapeutic applications of FTY720 that focuses on inhibition of ceramide biosynthesis, ceramide-dependent signaling, and the up-regulation of DHS1P generation in cells.

Thus, FTY720 was found to bind to and inhibit the cannabinoid CB1 receptor (6Paugh S.W. Cassidy M.P. He H. Milstien S. Sim-Selley L.J. Spiegel S. Selley D.E. Mol. Pharmacol. 2006; 70: 41-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), to inhibit cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2), and to counteract ceramide 1-phosphate-induced cPLA2 activation (7Payne S.G.

Additionally FTY720 but not FTY720-P was shown to inhibit S1P lyase (8Bandhuvula P. Tam Y.Y. Oskouian B. Saba J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 33697-33700Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), which degrades S1P to ethanolamine phosphate and (E)-2-hexadecenal and regulates the removal of sphingoid bases from the cumulative pool of sphingolipids. These findings characterize FTY720 as a molecule with a multitargeted mode of action whose cellular effects are complicated by its metabolic transformation to FTY720-P, a structural and functional analog of S1P. Phosphorylation of FTY720 to FTY720-P by sphingosine kinases (SphKs) is the only reported metabolic transformation of FTY720 and has been actively explored because of its link to S1P-mediated signaling (1Zhang Z.

Metabolic interconnections between proapoptotic (ceramides) and prosurvival (dihydrosphingosine 1-phosphate (DHS1P)) molecules are expected because it is known that fumonisin B1 (FB1), an inhibitor of (dihydro)ceramide synthases, not only blocks the formation of ceramides and up-regulates the intracellular content of dihydrosphingosine (DHSph) but also increases the cellular level of DHS1P (19Suzuki H.

In view of these considerations, it is important to know how compounds with a potential ability to interfere with the sphingolipidome turnover affect the DHS1P-S1P/ceramide balance in cells. To address this question we have investigated the effect of FTY720 on metabolic pathways leading to ceramide and sphingoid base 1-phosphate generation in human pulmonary artery endothelial cells (HPAECs) by using a stable isotope pulse labeling approach and quantitative liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry of signaling sphingolipids. We demonstrate that treatment of HPAECs with FTY720 results in the inhibition of de novo ceramide formation with a concomitant increase in DHSph and DHS1P content in cells. Moreover FTY720 showed a direct inhibition of ceramide synthases in an in vitro assay, albeit it was less efficient compared with the classical inhibitor of ceramide synthases, FB1. Our present findings have identified ceramide synthase isozymes as a novel molecular target for FTY720 action, opening a new direction for its potential therapeutic application through the inhibition of ceramide biosynthesis, ceramide-dependent signaling, and the up-regulation of DHS1P generation in cells. Standards and Reagents—Sph, DHSph, a 17-carbon analog of Sph (C17-Sph), S1P, DHS1P, a 17-carbon analog of S1P (C17-S1P), N-myristoyl (14:0), N-palmitoyl (16:0), N-oleoyl (18:1), N-stearoyl (18:0), N-arachidoyl (20:0), N-nervonoyl (24:1), N-lignoceroyl (24:0) sphingosines (ceramides (Cer)), N-palmitoyl (16:0), N-oleoyl (18:1), N-stearoyl (18:0), N-arachidoyl (20: 0), N-behenoyl (22:0), N-nervonoyl (24:1), N-lignoceroyl (24:0), DHSph (dihydroceramides (DHCer)), N-heptadecanoyl sphingosine (17:0-Cer), and the palmitoyl (16:0), stearoyl (18:0), arachidoyl (20:0), behenoyl (22:0), nervonoyl (24:1), and lignoceroyl (24:0) coenzyme A substrates were obtained from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL). 3-Keto-DHSph was purchased from Matreya (Pleasant Gap, PA). The nonphosphorylated lipid standards were dissolved in methanol, whereas the sphingoid base phosphates were dissolved in methanol containing a trace amount of concentrated HCl and were stored at –20 °C. FTY720 and FTY720-P were synthesized as described previously (21Lu X. Bittman R. Tetrahedron Lett. 2006; 47: 825-827Crossref Scopus (14) Google Scholar). l-[U-13C(98%), 15N(98%)]serine was purchased from Cambridge Isotope Laboratories (Andover, MA). SphK1 antibodies were from Abcam (Cambridge, MA). SphK2 antibodies were kindly provided by Dr. Taro Okada (Kobe University, Kobe, Japan). Cell Culture—HPAECs were from Lonza (Walkersville, MD) and were cultured in complete EGM-2 medium (Lonza). Passages between 5 and 7 were used for experiments. Cells were grown at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2, 95% air. Transfection of HPAECs with SphK1 and SphK2 siRNAs—siGENOME SMART pool siRNAs targeting SphK1 (5′-CGACGAGGACUUUGUGCUA-3′, 5′-GAACCAUUAUGCUGGCUAU-3′, 5′-GAGAAGGGCAGGCAUAUGG-3′, and 5′-GCUAUGAGCAGGUCACCAA-3′) and SphK2 (5′-CAAGGCAGCUCUACACUCA-3′, 5′-GAGACGGGCUGCUCCAUGA-3′, 5′-GCUCCUCCAUGGCGAGUUU-3′, and 5′-CCACUGCCCUCACCUGUCU-3′) were purchased from Dharmacon (Lafayette, CA). HPAECs grown to ∼50% confluence in 6-well plates were transfected with Gene Silencer® (Gene Therapy Systems, San Diego, CA) transfecting agent with 25 nm SphK1 or 10 nm SK2 siRNA in serum-free EBM-2 medium according to the manufacturer's recommendation. After 3 h post-transfection, 1 ml of fresh complete EGM-2 medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum was added, and the cells were cultured for an additional 72 h before treatment with FTY720 and lipid analysis by LC/MS/MS. The efficiency of silencing was confirmed by real time PCR and by Western blotting. Quantitative Reverse Transcription-PCR and Real Time Reverse Transcription-PCR—RNA (1 μg) was reverse transcribed using a cDNA synthesis kit (Bio-Rad), and real time PCR and quantitative PCR were performed to assess expression of SphK1 and SphK2 using primers designed for the human mRNA sequences. The following sequences were used for mRNA quantitation: SphK1 sense, 5′-TCCTTCACGCTGATGCTCACTG-3′; SphK1 antisense, 5′-CAGACGCCGATACTTCTCACTCTC-3′; SphK2 sense, 5′-CCCGGTTGCTTCTATTGGT; and SphK2 antisense, 5′-GACAGCCCAGCTTCAGAGAT. Amplicon expression in each sample was normalized to its 18 S RNA content. The relative abundance of target mRNA in each sample was calculated as 2 raised to the negative of its threshold cycle value times 106 after being normalized to the abundance of its corresponding 18 S (2–(primer Threshold Cycle)/2–(18 S Threshold Cycle) × 106). Negative controls, consisting of reaction mixtures containing all components except target RNA, were included with each reverse transcription-PCR run. To verify that amplified products were derived from mRNA and do not represent genomic DNA contamination, representative PCR mixtures for each gene were run in the absence of the reverse transcriptase enzyme after first being cycled to 95 °C for 15 min. Lipid Extraction and Sample Preparation for LC/MS/MS—Cellular lipids were extracted by a modified Bligh and Dyer (22Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (42411) Google Scholar) procedure with the use of 0.1 n HCl for phase separation. C17-S1P (40 pmol), C17-Sph (30 pmol), and 17:0-Cer (30 pmol) were used as internal standards and were added during the initial step of lipid extraction. The extracted lipids were dissolved in methanol/chloroform (4:1, v/v), and aliquots were taken to determine the total phospholipid content as described previously (23Vaskovsky V.E. Kostetsky E.Y. Vasendin I.M. J. Chromatogr. 1975; 114: 129-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar). Samples were concentrated under a stream of nitrogen, redissolved in methanol, transferred to autosampler vials, and subjected to consecutive LC/MS/MS analysis of sphingoid bases, ceramides, and sphingoid base 1-phosphates. Analysis of Sphingoid Bases, Sphingoid Base 1-Phosphates, Ceramides, FTY720, and FTY720 Phosphate—Analyses of the sphingolipids were performed by combined LC/MS/MS. The instrumentation used was an API4000 Q-trap hybrid triple quadrupole linear ion trap mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) equipped with a TurboIonSpray ionization source interfaced with an automated Agilent 1100 series liquid chromatograph and autosampler (Agilent Technologies, Wilmington, DE). The sphingolipids were ionized via electrospray ionization (ESI) with detection via multiple reaction monitoring (MRM). Analysis of sphingoid bases and the molecular species of ceramides used ESI in positive ions with MRM analysis using a minor modification of published methods (24Murphy R.C. Fiedler J. Hevko J. Chem. Rev. 2001; 101: 479-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar, 25Merrill A.H. Caligan T.B. Wang E. Peters K. Ou J. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 312: 3-9Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly resolution of sphingoid bases was achieved with a Discovery C18 column (2.1 × 50 mm, 5-μm particle size; Supelco, Bellefonte, PA) and a gradient from methanol/water/formic acid (61:38:1, v/v) with 5 mm ammonium formate to methanol/acetonitrile/formic acid (39:60:1, v/v) with 5 mm ammonium formate at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. The MRM transitions used for detection of sphingoid bases were as follows: m/z 286 → 268 (C17-Sph, internal standard), m/z 300 → 282 (Sph), and m/z 302 → 284 (DHSph). Ceramide molecular species were resolved using a 3 × 100-mm X-Terra XDB-C8 column (3.5-μm particle size; Waters, Milford, MA) and a gradient from methanol/water/formic acid (61:39:0.5, v/v) with 5 mm ammonium formate to acetonitrile/chloroform/water/formic acid (90:10:0.5:0.5, v/v) with 5 mm ammonium formate at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. MRM transitions monitored for the elution of ceramide molecular species were as follows: m/z 510 → 264, 14:0-Cer; m/z 538 → 264, 16:0-Cer; m/z 540 → 284, 16:0-DHCer; m/z 552 → 264, 17:0-Cer (internal standard); m/z 564 → 264, 18:1-Cer; m/z 566 → 284, 18:1-DHCer; m/z 566 → 264, 18:0-Cer; m/z 568 → 284, 18:0-DHCer; m/z 594 → 264, 20:0-Cer; m/z 596 → 284, 20:0-DHCer; m/z 624 → 284, 22:0-DHCer; m/z 650 → 264, 24:1-Cer; m/z 652 → 284, 24:1-DHCer; m/z 652 → 264, 24:0-Cer; m/z 654 → 284, 24:0-DHCer; m/z 680 → 264, 26:1-Cer; m/z 682 → 264, 26:0-Cer; m/z 708 → 264, 28:1-Cer; and m/z 710 → 264, 28:0-Cer. S1P and DHS1P were quantified as bisacetylated derivatives with C17-S1P as the internal standard using reverse-phase high pressure liquid chromatography separation, negative ion ESI, and MRM analysis. Details of this approach were described previously (26Berdyshev E.V. Gorshkova I.A. Garcia J.G. Natarajan V. Hubbard W.C. Anal. Biochem. 2005; 339: 129-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). FTY720 was analyzed along with sphingoid bases using positive ion ESI and MRM analysis of the transition from m/z 308 to m/z 255. C17-Sph was used as the internal standard for the quantitation of FTY720. FTY720-P was analyzed along with S1P and DHS1P as a bisacetylated derivative using negative ion ESI and C17-S1P as the internal standard. The m/z 470 → 410 transition was used to detect and quantify FTY720-P. Standard curves for each of the sphingoid bases, sphingoid base 1-phosphates, ceramide molecular species, FTY720, and FTY720-P were constructed via the addition of increasing concentrations of the individual analyte to 30 pmol of the structural analogs of the sphingolipid classes used as the internal standards. Linearity and the correlation coefficients of the standard curves were obtained via a linear regression analysis. The standard curves were linear over the range of 0.0–300 pmol of each of the sphingolipid analytes with correlation coefficients (R2) > 0.98. Pulse Labeling Experiments—After HPAECs were treated with FTY720 or FB1 in complete EBM-2 medium for 3 h, the cells were pulse-labeled for 2 h with l-[U-13C, 15N]serine (50 mg/liter) dissolved in EBM-2 complete medium containing the same concentrations of FTY720 or FB1. The medium was removed, and the lipids were extracted as described above. Quantitation of the label incorporated into the sphingolipids was achieved by the use of LC/MS/MS by monitoring the [M + 3] isotopes in precursor and product ions used in corresponding MRM programs to detect sphingoid bases, ceramides, and sphingoid base 1-phosphates as described previously (27Berdyshev E.V. Gorshkova I.A. Usatyuk P. Zhao Y. Saatian B. Hubbard W. Natarajan V. Cell. Signal. 2006; 18: 1779-1792Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Ceramide Synthase and Serine Palmitoyltransferase (SPT) Assays—The ceramide synthase assay was performed using the total HPAEC lysate as described previously (28Laviad E.L. Albee L. Pankova-Kholmyansky I. Epstein S. Park H. Merrill Jr., A.H. Futerman A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 5677-5684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar) with DHSph and different acyl-CoA substrates. Briefly assays were performed with 0.01–10 μm DHSph; 5 μm 16:0-, 18:0-, 20:0-, 22:0-, or 24:1-CoA (all as a solution in 0.1% BSA); and 50 μg of total protein/assay for 15 min at 37 °C in a reaction buffer consisting of 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 2 mm MgCl2, 25 mm KCl, and 0.1% BSA. FTY720 (0.1–30 μm) was added as a solution in 0.1% BSA to the reaction buffer 2 min before the addition of DHSph solubilized in 0.1% BSA. The reaction was stopped by lipid extraction with 17:0-Cer as the internal standard, and product formation (16:0-, 18:0-, 20:0-, 22:0-, and 24:1-DHCer) was quantified by LC/MS/MS. The serine palmitoyltransferase assay was performed as described previously (29Yamaji-Hasegawa A. Takahashi A. Tetsuka Y. Senoh Y. Kobayashi T. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 268-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) with 1 mm stable isotope-labeled l-[U-13C, 15N]serine and 0.4 mm 16:0-CoA as substrates. The reaction was carried out with 100 μg of total lysate protein/reaction for 20 min at 37 °C in a buffer consisting of 20 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, containing 5 mm EDTA, 10 mm dithiothreitol, and 50 μm pyridoxal 5′-phosphate. The reaction was stopped by lipid extraction with C17-Sph as the internal standard. The stable isotope-labeled [M + 3] analog of 3-keto-DHSph was quantified by LC/MS/MS by detecting a specific transition from m/z 303 to m/z 285, which corresponds to the M + 3 isotope analogs of molecular and product ions of 3-keto-DHSph. The standard curve of response of variable amounts of 3-keto-DHSph versus fixed amounts of C17-Sph was created to perform a proper quantitative determination of the formed product. Statistical Analyses—Each experiment was performed in triplicate. At least three independent experiments were carried out, and the data for one representative experiment are presented as the mean ± S.E. Two-tailed unpaired t tests were performed as post hoc tests of significance. Kinetic analysis of the inhibition of ceramide synthases by FTY720 was performed using the GraphPad Prism enzyme kinetic module (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA). LC/MS/MS Quantitation of FTY720 and FTY720-P Using C17-Sph and C17-S1P as Internal Standards—To integrate the analyses of FTY720 and FTY720-P into the existing and already used protocols of LC/MS/MS quantitation of sphingoid bases and sphingoid base 1-phosphates we developed an LC/MS/MS approach with synthetic C17-Sph and C17-S1P as the internal standards. First we determined the breakdown pattern of FTY720 and found that the transition from m/z 308 to m/z 255 due to the loss of two water molecules and the amino group is the most characteristic for FTY720 in the positive ion mode (Fig. 1A). Then we confirmed that FTY720 can be resolved from all analyzed sphingoid bases using the column and solvent protocol we used for the sphingoid base analysis (Fig. 1B). Finally we determined the linearity of the standard curve with increasing amounts of FTY720 (1–300 pmol) and a fixed amount (30 pmol) of C17-Sph without (Fig. 1C) and with (Fig. 1D) the background of total lipids extracted from HPAECs (∼200 pmol of total lipid phosphorus on the column) (Fig. 1C). The data demonstrate a linear relationship of the response over a wide range of analyte concentrations with correlation coefficients greater than 0.995. Similarly we found that FTY720-P can be analyzed in the negative ion mode as its bisacetylated derivative along with S1P and DHS1P. The amino and the hydroxy groups of FTY720-P are easily acetylated, and the loss of an acetyl moiety gives rise to a characteristic m/z 470 to m/z 410 transition (Fig. 1E). Chromatographically FTY720-P bisacetate behaves similarly to the S1P and DHS1P bisacetylated derivatives (Fig. 1F), and most importantly, the standard curve of the response of variable amounts of FTY720-P versus a fixed amount of C17-S1P (the internal standard) is linear (R2 > 0.995) over a wide range of FTY720-P concentrations in the presence or absence of total lipid extracts (Fig. 1, G and H). Integration of FTY720 and FTY720-P quantitation into the existing protocols of LC/MS/MS analysis of sphingoid bases and sphingoid base 1-phosphates is a logical and chemically rational approach. FTY720 and FTY720-P are structurally very similar to DHSph and DHS1P, respectively, and their reactivity and chromatographic behavior are very similar to those of DHSph and DHS1P. Hence the use of synthetic C17 analogs of Sph and S1P as the internal standards for the quantitation of FTY720 and FTY720-P is a convenient approach. Because of the structural similarities between FTY720-P and DHS1P, both compounds undergo acetylation of one amino group and one hydroxyl group and lose one acetyl moiety in the most characteristic transition during collision-induced decomposition. We found that C17-Sph and C17-S1P are good substitutions for stable isotope-labeled analogs of FTY720 and FTY720-P, which would be optimal choices but are not yet available. An ether analog of FTY720 (compound Y-32919, Novartis Pharma AG, Basel, Switzerland) and its phosphorylated derivative were used previously as internal standards to quantify FTY720 and FTY720-P, respectively (15Zemann B. Kinzel B. Müller M. Reuschel R. Mechtcheriakova D. Urtz N. Bornancin F. Baumruker T. Billich A. Blood. 2006; 107: 1454-1458Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar, 30Salm P. Warnholtz C.R. Lynch S.V. Taylor P.J. J. Chromatogr. B Anal. Technol. Biomed. Life Sci. 2006; 843: 157-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). However, because these compounds are not readily available, the choice of C17-Sph and C17-S1P as internal standards for quantitation of FTY720 and FTY720-P is a simple and convenient substitute strategy. FTY720 Up-regulates DHS1P Biosynthesis through the Inhibition of Ceramide Synthase(s)—Treatment of HPAECs with FTY720 affected intracellular levels of all of the major signaling sphingolipids. Thus, increasing concentrations of FTY720 gradually decreased S1P while increasing the DHS1P content in the cells (Fig. 2A). The shift in S1P-DHS1P ratio was mirrored by similar changes in the content of sphingoid bases (Fig. 2B), suggesting that FTY720 interferes with ceramide biosynthesis and/or catabolism. Indeed FTY720 decreased the ceramide level in cells (Fig. 2B) but had no effect on dihydroceramides (data not shown). This observation suggests a potential inhibition of DHSph conversion to dihydroceramides by (dihydro)ceramide synthase(s) rather than the inhibition of dihydroceramide desaturase. Next we investigated the fate of the exogenously added FTY720 to HPAECs. Quantitative LC/MS/MS analysis of both FTY720 and FTY720-P in lipid extracts revealed that ∼1% of the added FTY720 was converted to FTY720-P, whereas >98% of the added FTY720 was recovered from cells at 2 h after the beginning of treatment (Fig. 2). To identify the metabolic step in the sphingolipid biosynthetic pathway affected by FTY720, we used stable isotope labeling in conjunction with LC/MS/MS quantitation of labeled sphingolipids, an approach recently adopted by us for sphingolipid metabolic studies related to DHS1P and S1P formation in SphK1-overespressing cells (27Berdyshev E.V. Gorshkova I.A. Usatyuk P. Zhao Y. Saatian B. Hubbard W. Natarajan V. Cell. Signal. 2006; 18: 1779-1792Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). This approach consists of pulse labeling of cells with l-[U-13C, 15N]serine and quantitation of the [M + 3] mass analogs of natural sphingolipids that allows one to establish which metabolic step of sphingolipid de novo biosynthesis is affected. As shown in Fig. 3, treatment of HPAECs with FTY720 led to a substantial accumulation of stable isotope-labeled DHSph in cells, but no change in the content of labeled Sph was observed.

https://openalex.org/W2023639417,"ATP-binding cassette transporters play an important role in drug resistance and nutrient transport. In the human malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum, a homolog of the human p-glycoprotein (PfPgh-1) was shown to be involved in resistance to several drugs. More recently, many transporters were associated with higher IC(50) levels in responses to chloroquine (CQ) and quinine (QN) in field isolates. Subsequent studies, however, could not confirm the associations, although inaccuracy in drug tests in the later studies could contribute to the lack of associations. Here we disrupted a gene encoding a putative multidrug resistance-associated protein (PfMRP) that was previously shown to be associated with P. falciparum responses to CQ and QN. Parasites with disrupted PfMRP (W2/MRPDelta) could not grow to a parasitemia higher than 5% under normal culture conditions, possibly because of lower efficiency in removing toxic metabolites. The W2/MRPDelta parasite also accumulated more radioactive glutathione, CQ, and QN and became more sensitive to multiple antimalarial drugs, including CQ, QN, artemisinin, piperaquine, and primaquine. PfMRP was localized on the parasite surface membrane, within membrane-bound vesicles, and along the straight side of the D-shaped stage II gametocytes. The results suggest that PfMRP plays a role in the efflux of glutathione, CQ, and QN and contributes to parasite responses to multiple antimalarial drugs, possibly by pumping drugs outside the parasite."

We investigated the role of fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 (FGFR2) in osteoblast committment and differentiation of murine mesenchymal C3H10T1/2 cells stably transfected with wild type (WT) or activated FGFR2 due to Apert S252W genetic mutation (MT). WT FGFR2 slightly increased, whereas MT FGFR2 strongly increased, FGFR2 tyrosine phosphorylation, indicating activation of the receptor. WT and MT FGFR2 increased C3H10T1/2 cell proliferation but not survival. Both WT and MT FGFR2 increased early and late osteoblast gene expression and matrix mineralization. Forced expression of WT and MT FGFR2 also increased osteoblast gene expression in MC3T3-E1 calvaria osteoblasts. In both cell types, MT FGFR2 was more effective than WT FGFR2. In contrast, WT and MT FGFR2 decreased adipocyte differentiation of C3H10T1/2 cells. WT and MT FGFR2 induced ERK1/2 but not JNK or PI3K/AKT phosphorylation. MT, but not WT, also increased protein kinase C (PKC) activity. Pharmacological inhibition of ERK1/2 prevented cell proliferation induced by WT and MT FGFR2. Using dominant-negative ERK and PKCα vectors, we demonstrated that WT and MT FGFR2 promoted osteoblast gene expression through ERK1/2 and PKCα signaling, respectively. This study identifies FGFR2 as a novel regulatory molecule that promotes osteogenic differentiation in murine MSCs. The promoting effect of WT and MT FGFR2 is mediated by ERK1/2 and PKCα pathways that play essential and distinct roles in FGFR2-induced osteogenic differentiation of mesenchymal cells.

Notably, FGF2 was found to promote cell growth and osteoblast differentiation in bone marrow-derived mesenchymal cells (25Martin I. Muraglia A. Campanile G. Cancedda R. Quarto R.

Consistent with an important role of FGF signaling in the control of osteoprogenitor cells, deletion of FGF2 in mice results in decreased bone marrow stromal cell osteogenic differentiation and altered bone formation (27Montero A.

The actions of FGFs are highly dependent on high affinity FGF receptors (FGFRs) (28Eswarakumar V.P. Lax I. Schlessinger J. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 2005; 16: 139-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (1464) Google Scholar). FGF binding to FGFRs leads to receptor dimerization and phosphorylation of intrinsic tyrosine residues, which leads to activation of several signal transduction pathways including phospholipase Cγ (PLCγ), mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK), and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) (29Mohammadi M.

In bone, activation of extracellular-related kinase (ERK1/2) MAPK and protein kinase C (PKC) was found to enhance osteoblast gene expression (31Xiao G. Jiang D. Gopalakrishnan R. Franceschi R.T. J.

The important role of FGFR signaling in bone formation is highlighted by the finding that gain-of-function mutations in FGFRs results in premature cranial osteogenesis (33Ornitz D.M. Marie P.J.

However, the role of FGFR2 signaling in osteogenic differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells is yet to be elucidated.In the present study, we investigated the specific role of FGFR2 signaling on osteoblast commitment and differentiation in murine mesenchymal progenitor cells. Our results indicate that wild-type and activated FGFR2 induce osteogenic differentiation in mesenchymal cells through distinct activation of ERK1/2 and PKCα signaling. These data indicate that FGFR2-induced activation of specific downstream signaling pathways mediates osteogenic differentiation of murine mesenchymal cells.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCells and Materials—Murine pluripotent mesenchymal C3H10T1/2 cells and MC3T3-E1, a recognized osteoblastic cell line, were obtained from the ATCC. Cells were routinely cultured in Dulbecco's Modified Eagles Medium (DMEM; Invitrogen, Paisley, Scotland) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (FCS), 1% l-glutamine, and penicillin/streptomycin (10,000 units/ml and 10,000 μg/ml, respectively), at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2 in air. Culture media were changed every 2 days. Anti-FGFR2, anti-phosphotyrosine (p-Tyr), anti-ERK, and anti-p-ERK were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Other antibodies (anti-AKT, anti-p-AKT, anti-JNK, anti-p-JNK, anti-PI3K p85, and anti-p-PI3K p85 were from Cell Signaling (Sigma-Aldrich). The β-actin antibody, U0126 (an inhibitor of MAPK kinase 1 and 2 (MEK1/2) that blocks phosphorylation and activation of ERK1/2 (42Favata M.F. Horiuchi K.Y. Manos E.J. Daulerio A.J. Stradley D.A.

After 48 h, the transfectants were selected in DMEM medium containing 10% FCS and 1 mg/ml G418 (Geneticin, Sigma) for 4 weeks. To analyze whether FGFR2 activation may affect more mature osteoprogenitor cells, we also performed transient transfection experiments with WT or MT FGFR2 in MC3T3-E1 mouse calvaria cells. In parallel experiments, EV, WT, and MT C3H10T1/2 cells were transiently transfected with a dominant-negative ERKp44-MAPK kinase-deficient mutant vector (DN-ERK) (43Pagés G. Lenormand P. L'Allemain G. Chambard J.C. Meloche S. Pouysségur J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8319-8323Crossref PubMed Scopus (923) Google Scholar), a dominant-negative PKCα vector (DN-PKCα) or empty vectors and Exgen (Euromedex) according to the manufacturer's instructions.Cell Proliferation and Apoptosis Assays—For the cell proliferation assay, stably transfected C3H10T1/2 cells were cultured in 6-well plates (105 cells per well), and cell number was evaluated by cell counting. For the apoptosis assay, stably transfected C3H10T1/2 cells were cultured in the presence of 1 or 5% FCS, and apoptosis was detected using the Apopercentage apoptosis assay (Biocolor, Belfast, Northern Ireland). Briefly, 20 μl of dye (1/100) were added to the medium. After 30 min, the cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were lysed in DMSO, and absorbance at 550 nm was determined. In some wells, H2O2 (5 mmol/liter) was added to the medium for 2 h before harvesting the cells to induce apoptosis, thereby serving as a positive control.Protein Kinase C Activity—PKC activity was determined using a PKC Activity Assay kit (Assay Designs, Ann Arbor, MI) based on a solid phase enzyme-linked immuno-absorbent assay (ELISA), according to the manufacturer's instructions. The assay utilizes a specific synthetic peptide as a substrate for PKC, and a polyclonal antibody that recognizes the phosphorylated form of the substrate.Quantitative RT-PCR Analysis—Total RNAs were isolated using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen). 3 μg of total RNA from each sample were reverse-transcribed using MMLV reverse transcriptase and oligodT primers at 37 °C for 90 min. The relative mRNA levels were evaluated by quantitative PCR (LightCycler, Roche Applied Science, Indianapolis, OH) using a SYBR Green PCR kit (ABGen, Courtabœuf, France) and specific primers (supplemental Table S1). Signals were normalized to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase as internal control.Western Blot Analysis—Cell lysates were prepared as described (38Lemonnier J. Hay E. Delannoy P. Lomri A. Modrowski D. Caverzasio J. Marie P.J. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2001; 16: 832-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Briefly, proteins (30 μg) were resolved on 4–12% SDS-PAGE and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride nitrocellulose membranes (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA). Filters were incubated for 2 h in 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% (v/v) Tween-20, 0.5% (w/v), bovine serum albumin (TBST/BSA), then overnight at 4 °C on a shaker with specific primary antibodies (1/500–1/1000 in TBST/BSA). Membranes were washed twice with TBST and incubated for 2 h with appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (1:10,000–1:20,000 in TBST/BSA). After final washes, the signals were visualized with enhanced chemiluminescence Western blotting detection reagent (ECL, Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ) and autoradiographic film (X-OMAT-AR, Eastman Kodak Company, Rochester, NY). Densitometric analysis using ImageQuant software was performed following digital scanning (Agfa). Representative images of immunoblots are shown. For immunoprecipitation analysis, cell lysates were prepared as for Western blot analysis, and aliquots of total protein (150 μg) were incubated overnight under weak agitation at 4 °C with 2 μg of specific anti-FGFR2 and 20 μl of Dynabeads protein G (Invitrogen). Components of the bound immune complex (both antigen and antibody) were eluted from the Dynabeads and analyzed by SDS-PAGE according to the manufacturer's recommendations.Alkaline Phosphatase Staining—ALP staining was performed using Sigma FAST kit according to the manufacturer's recommendations (Sigma). Briefly, cells were fixed in 75% ethanol, rinsed in phosphate-buffered saline, and incubated with the substrate buffer at 37 °C.Osteogenic, Chondrogenic, and Adipogenic Assays—Cell culture medium was supplemented with 50 μmol/liter ascorbic acid and 3 mm inorganic phosphate (NaH2PO4) to allow matrix synthesis and mineralization. At the indicated time points, cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline. Matrix mineralization was evaluated by alizarin red and von Kossa staining as described (44Ahdjoudj S. Lasmoles F. Oyajobi B.O. Lomri A. Delannoy P. Marie P.J. J. Cell. Biochem. 2001; 81: 23-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) and microphotographed using an Olympus microscope (Japan). Glycoprotein synthesis was determined by alcian blue staining (44Ahdjoudj S. Lasmoles F. Oyajobi B.O. Lomri A. Delannoy P. Marie P.J. J. Cell. Biochem. 2001; 81: 23-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). For adipogenesis, the accumulation of lipid droplets, a hallmark of functional adipogenesis, was detected by oil red staining (44Ahdjoudj S. Lasmoles F. Oyajobi B.O. Lomri A. Delannoy P. Marie P.J. J. Cell. Biochem. 2001; 81: 23-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) and quantified at 14 days of culture, as described (45Laughton C. Anal. Biochem. 1986; 156: 307-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Briefly, the stain solution was removed, and cells were rinsed in 500 μl of 60% isopropyl alcohol for 5 s. To extract dye, 700 μl of 60% isopropyl alcohol was added per well, and sealed plates were shaken for 2 h. The extracted dye was quantitated spectrophotometrically at 510 nm.Statistical Analysis—The data are the mean ± S.D. of an average of six samples and are representative of at least three distinct experiments. The data were analyzed by Student's t test, and a minimal level of p < 0.05 was considered significant.RESULTSExpression of FGFRs in C3H10T1/2 Cells—We first determined the expression levels of FGFR1–4 in growing C3H10T1/2 cells. Quantitative PCR analysis showed that mRNA expression levels of the four FGFRs differed markedly at 3 days of culture (Fig. 1A). FGFR1 was higher than FGFR2 mRNA levels. In contrast, FGFR3 mRNA expression was weak, and FGFR4 level was almost undetectable (Fig. 1A), suggesting that FGFR1 and FGFR2 are major FGF receptors expressed in these mesenchymal cells. The kinetics analysis of change of the two main FGFRs expressed in growing C3H10T1/2 cells showed that the FGFR1 mRNA level rose and then declined in confluent cells whereas the FGFR2 mRNA level increased in confluent cells (Fig. 1, B and C), suggesting that FGFR2 may be an important transducer of FGF signals in post-proliferating osteoblasts.Expression and Activation of FGFR2 in Stably Transfected C3H10T1/2 Cells—We then analyzed the effect of FGFR2 signaling in C3H10T1/2 cells. To this goal, the cells were stably transfected with wild-type (WT) FGFR2 or a constitutively activating FGFR2 due to Apert S252W mutation (MT). As expected, quantitative PCR analysis showed that transfection with the two vectors increased FGFR2 mRNA levels in C3H10T1/2 cells (data not shown). Western blot analysis showed a 2–3-fold increase in FGFR2 protein levels in WT- and MT-transfected cells, indicating that FGFR2 protein levels increased similarly in WT and MT FGFR2-transfected cells (Fig. 2A). FGFR activation is characterized by phosphorylation of the cytoplasmic domain that transduces intracellular signals. We analyzed tyrosine phosphorylation of FGFR2 in WT and MT FGFR2-transfected cells. As shown in Fig. 2, B and C, WT FGFR2 induced a slight increase in tyrosine-phosphorylated FGFR2 level under basal conditions (i.e. in the absence of exogenous FGF) compared with EV-transfected cells. In contrast, a 2-fold increase in the tyrosine-phosphorylated FGFR2 level was found in MT FGFR2-transfected cells (Fig. 2, B and C). These data indicate that forced expression of WT FGFR2 slightly activated the receptor in the absence of exogenous ligand, whereas MT FGFR2 induced a marked activation of the receptor.FIGURE 2FGFR2 promotes mesenchymal cell proliferation but not survival. Western blot analysis (A) showing increased FGFR2 protein levels in C3H10T1/2 cells stably transfected with WT FGFR2 or S252W FGFR2 MT compared with the empty vector (EV). Immunoprecipitation analysis (B) and quantification of blots (C) show increased tyrosine-phosphorylated (p)FGFR2 levels in WT and MT FGFR2 cells. a indicates a significant difference with EV-transfected cells; b indicates a significant difference with WT FGFR2-transfected cells (p < 0.05). Time course analysis showed that WT and MT FGFR2 increased cell number compared with control cells transfected with EV (D). * indicates a significant difference with EV-transfected cells (p < 0.05). WT or MT had no effect on cell survival determined by the Apopercentage assay in the presence of 5% serum or in serum-deprived (1%) conditions (E).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)FGFR2 Increases C3H10T1/2 Cell Proliferation but Not Survival—Activation of FGFR signaling induces multiple and complex effects on cell proliferation and survival (28Eswarakumar V.P. Lax I. Schlessinger J. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 2005; 16: 139-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (1464) Google Scholar). To determine the cellular effect of FGFR2 activation in mesenchymal cells, we first investigated the changes in cell proliferation in WT and MT FGFR2 stably transfected C3H10T1/2 cells. Overexpression of WT or MT FGFR2 increased cell proliferation compared with EV-transfected cells at all times of culture before and after confluence (Fig. 2D). Using an assay that detects early events involved in cell apoptosis, we then examined whether WT or MT FGFR2 may affect cell survival in C3H10T1/2 cells. As shown in Fig. 2E, MT or WT FGFR2 did not affect cell apoptosis when cultured in optimal survival conditions (5% FCS) or in culture condition inducing apoptosis (1% FCS) after 3 days of culture. These data indicate that WT or MT FGFR2 overexpression promotes cell proliferation but not cell survival in C3H10T1/2 cells under these experimental conditions.FGFR2 Promotes Osteogenic Differentiation in MSCs—We then investigated the effects of WT and MT FGFR2 on osteogenic differentiation of C3H10T1/2 cells. Quantitative PCR analysis showed that both WT and MT FGFR2 induced a 3–4-fold increase in mRNA expression of Runx2, a specific osteoblast transcription factor, at 4 and 6 days of culture (Fig. 3, A and B). In contrast, osterix mRNA level was not affected by WT or MT FGFR2. WT and MT FGFR2 induced a similar 2-fold increase in Col1A1 expression at 4 and 6 days (Fig. 3, A and B). Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and osteocalcin (OC) mRNA levels were also increased by WT and MT FGFR2 at 6 days. However, the rise in ALP and OC was greater in MT than in WT FGFR2 (Fig. 3, A and B). Consistently, MT FGFR2 induced a greater increase in ALP activity and staining at day 2 than WT FGFR2 (Fig. 3, C and D). To confirm this finding in more mature cells, calvaria-derived MC3T3-E1 osteoblastic cells were transiently transfected with WT or MT FGFR2. Consistent with our data in C3H10T1/2 cells, MT FGFR2 increased ALP staining and osteoblast genes (Runx2, ALP, Col1A1) in MC3T3-E1 cells at day 2, and the effect was greater than WT FGFR2, except for osteocalcin expression (Fig. 3E), indicating that MT FGFR2 can promote osteoblast differentiation at different stages of development. We also determined the effects of WT and MT FGFR2 on in vitro matrix calcification in long term culture. As shown in Fig. 3F, MT FGFR2 induced a more rapid (7 versus 14 days) and greater extracellular matrix calcification at 21 days than WT FGFR2 (Fig. 3F). To further determine the effect of WT and MT FGFR2 at a terminal differentiation state, we analyzed the changes in SOST, a specific osteocyte marker (46van Bezooijen R.L. ten Dijke P. Papapoulos S.E. Löwik C.W. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 2005; 16: 319-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar) and DMP1 that is expressed by osteocytes (47Rios H.F. Ye L. Dusevich V. Eick D. Bonewald L.F. Feng J.Q. J. Musculoskelet. Neuronal Interact. 2005; 5: 325-327PubMed Google Scholar). Fig. 3G shows that SOST mRNA expression was increased by MT FGFR2 at 14 days and by WT FGFR2 at 21 days of culture, whereas DMP1 expression remained unchanged. Overall, these results reveal that both WT and MT FGFR2 increase osteoblast marker expression and osteogenic potential in vitro in C3H10T1/2 cells. However, MT FGFR2 is more effective in promoting early and terminal osteoblast differentiation and in vitro osteogenesis than WT FGFR2 in these cells.FIGURE 3FGFR2 promotes the osteogenic differentiation of mesenchymal cells.

Quantitative PCR analysis showed that MT FGFR2 decreased mRNA expression of the main adipocyte transcription factor PPARγ2 at 4, 6, and 14 days of culture (supplemental Fig. S2A). Furthermore, MT FGFR2 decreased the mRNA levels of C/EBPα (at 6 days) and C/EBPβ (at 4 and 6 days) that are transcription factors controlling adipogenesis, as well as aP2 (at 4–14 days), which is expressed in more mature adipocytes. Both WT and MT FGFR2 decreased mRNA levels of LPL, a late adipocyte differentiation marker, at 4 and 6 days (supplemental Fig. S2A). Consistent with these data,"
https://openalex.org/W1985007837,"The transcription factor NF-kappaB is required for lymphocyte activation and proliferation as well as the survival of certain lymphoma types. Antigen receptor stimulation assembles an NF-kappaB activating platform containing the scaffold protein CARMA1 (also called CARD11), the adaptor BCL10 and the paracaspase MALT1 (the CBM complex), linked to the inhibitor of NF-kappaB kinase complex, but signal transduction is not fully understood. We conducted parallel screens involving a mass spectrometry analysis of CARMA1 binding partners and an RNA interference screen for growth inhibition of the CBM-dependent 'activated B-cell-like' (ABC) subtype of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). Here we report that both screens identified casein kinase 1alpha (CK1alpha) as a bifunctional regulator of NF-kappaB. CK1alpha dynamically associates with the CBM complex on T-cell-receptor (TCR) engagement to participate in cytokine production and lymphocyte proliferation. However, CK1alpha kinase activity has a contrasting role by subsequently promoting the phosphorylation and inactivation of CARMA1. CK1alpha has thus a dual 'gating' function which first promotes and then terminates receptor-induced NF-kappaB. ABC DLBCL cells required CK1alpha for constitutive NF-kappaB activity, indicating that CK1alpha functions as a conditionally essential malignancy gene-a member of a new class of potential cancer therapeutic targets."
https://openalex.org/W1964359323,"Tuberculosis (TB), caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), is an enduring public health problem globally, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa. Several studies have suggested a role for host genetic susceptibility in increased risk for TB but results across studies have been equivocal. As part of a household contact study of Mtb infection and disease in Kampala, Uganda, we have taken a unique approach to the study of genetic susceptibility to TB, by studying three phenotypes. First, we analyzed culture confirmed TB disease compared to latent Mtb infection (LTBI) or lack of Mtb infection. Second, we analyzed resistance to Mtb infection in the face of continuous exposure, defined by a persistently negative tuberculin skin test (PTST-); this outcome was contrasted to LTBI. Third, we analyzed an intermediate phenotype, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFα) expression in response to soluble Mtb ligands enriched with molecules secreted from Mtb (culture filtrate). We conducted a full microsatellite genome scan, using genotypes generated by the Center for Medical Genetics at Marshfield. Multipoint model-free linkage analysis was conducted using an extension of the Haseman-Elston regression model that includes half sibling pairs, and HIV status was included as a covariate in the model. The analysis included 803 individuals from 193 pedigrees, comprising 258 full sibling pairs and 175 half sibling pairs. Suggestive linkage (p<10−3) was observed on chromosomes 2q21-2q24 and 5p13-5q22 for PTST-, and on chromosome 7p22-7p21 for TB; these findings for PTST- are novel and the chromosome 7 region contains the IL6 gene. In addition, we replicated recent linkage findings on chromosome 20q13 for TB (p = 0.002). We also observed linkage at the nominal α = 0.05 threshold to a number of promising candidate genes, SLC11A1 (PTST- p = 0.02), IL-1 complex (TB p = 0.01), IL12BR2 (TNFα p = 0.006), IL12A (TB p = 0.02) and IFNGR2 (TNFα p = 0.002). These results confirm not only that genetic factors influence the interaction between humans and Mtb but more importantly that they differ according to the outcome of that interaction: exposure but no infection, infection without progression to disease, or progression of infection to disease. Many of the genetic factors for each of these stages are part of the innate immune system."
https://openalex.org/W1988339395,"The green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii has a network of fermentation pathways that become active when cells acclimate to anoxia. Hydrogenase activity is an important component of this metabolism, and we have compared metabolic and regulatory responses that accompany anaerobiosis in wild-type C. reinhardtii cells and a null mutant strain for the HYDEF gene (hydEF-1 mutant), which encodes an [FeFe] hydrogenase maturation protein. This mutant has no hydrogenase activity and exhibits elevated accumulation of succinate and diminished production of CO2 relative to the parental strain during dark, anaerobic metabolism. In the absence of hydrogenase activity, increased succinate accumulation suggests that the cells activate alternative pathways for pyruvate metabolism, which contribute to NAD(P)H reoxidation, and continued glycolysis and fermentation in the absence of O2. Fermentative succinate production potentially proceeds via the formation of malate, and increases in the abundance of mRNAs encoding two malateforming enzymes, pyruvate carboxylase and malic enzyme, are observed in the mutant relative to the parental strain following transfer of cells from oxic to anoxic conditions. Although C. reinhardtii has a single gene encoding pyruvate carboxylase, it has six genes encoding putative malic enzymes. Only one of the malic enzyme genes, MME4, shows a dramatic increase in expression (mRNA abundance) in the hydEF-1 mutant during anaerobiosis. Furthermore, there are marked increases in transcripts encoding fumarase and fumarate reductase, enzymes putatively required to convert malate to succinate.

Moreover, C. reinhardtii can balance the use of the tricarboxylic acid cycle with fermentation when the rate of respiratory O2 consumption exceeds the rate of photosynthetic O2 evolution (3Kosourov S.

The catabolism of intracellular carbon stores during anoxic acclimation is a key component of C. reinhardtii metabolism as this alga does not appear to effectively assimilate extracellular sugars. Acquiring a better understanding of cellular metabolisms in algae such as C. reinhardtii under various conditions will facilitate the development of physiological models that predict metabolic circuits and the interactions among these circuits. Additionally, the secretion of fermentative metabolites by C. reinhardtii (and other algae) likely has significant impacts on the population dynamics of microbial consortia in environments inhabited by C. reinhardtii. There is also the potential to leverage the unique metabolic flexibility of C. reinhardtii for the production of valuable metabolites such as H2, organic acids, and ethanol as renewable bioenergy carriers (4Ghirardi M.L.

The availability of the C. reinhardtii genome sequence, combined with high throughput “omics”-based approaches, will be critical in this effort. Moreover, the use of specific mutant strains can help establish the foundation for a more comprehensive understanding of how cells adjust metabolite fluxes when specific reactions are blocked.

The acetyl-CoA is further metabolized to ethanol and/or acetate, and the reduced ferredoxin generated by PFR1 activity is putatively oxidized by a number of redox proteins, including one or both of the two C. reinhardtii [FeFe] hydrogenases (HYDA1 and HYDA2) (16Forestier M.

In this study we use molecular and physiological approaches to examine dark, anoxic acclimation of the C. reinhardtii hydEF-1 mutant. Interestingly, the mutant secretes much higher levels of succinate during anoxia than the parental strain. Furthermore, transcripts encoding PYC1 (pyruvate carboxylase) and MME4 (a malic enzyme) increase significantly in the mutant relative to the parental strain during anaerobiosis. Both of these proteins have the ability to carboxylate pyruvate, providing precursors for the fermentative production of succinate. Additionally, transcripts encoding fumarase (FUM1 and FUM2) and FMR1 (fumarate reductase), enzymes that catalyze the final steps of succinate synthesis, are elevated in the hydEF-1 strain. Utilization of these pathways for succinate synthesis would result in NADH reoxidation, which would sustain additional cycles of glycolysis and explain both the relative increase in succinate and decrease in CO2 production during anaerobiosis in the mutant relative to the parental strain. Microarray studies were also performed and reveal that several transcripts encoding proteins associated with cellular redox functions and other aspects of anaerobic metabolism are differentially regulated in the mutant relative to the parental strain. These findings are discussed with respect to the identification of potential new fermentation pathways and the flexibility of whole-cell metabolism in C. reinhardtii under dynamic environmental conditions. Strains and Growth Conditions-C. reinhardtii CC-425 (cw15, sr-u-60, arg7-8, mt+) and hydEF-1 mutant (derived from CC-425) cells were grown in Tris/acetate/phosphate medium (TAP) 2The abbreviations used are: TAP, Tris/acetate/phosphate medium; qPCR, quantified by reverse transcriptase real time PCR; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; PEP, phosphoenolpyruvate; PEPC, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase; PCK, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase; MDH, malate dehydrogenase; FUM, fumarase; FMR, fumarate reductase; MME, malic enzyme. (pH 7.2), supplemented with 200 mg·liter-1 arginine for CC-425. Algal cultures were maintained at 25 °C, vigorously bubbled with air enriched with 3% CO2, stirred using a magnetic stir bar, and illuminated with continuous light of 80 μmol photon m-2 s-1 photosynthetically active radiation at the surface of 1-liter Roux culture bottles (255 × 55 × 120 mm), in which cell densities ranged from 1 × 105 to 3 × 106 cells/ml of culture. Chlorophyll Measurements-Chlorophyll a and b content were determined spectrophotometrically in 95% ethanol (25Harris E.H. The Chlamydomonas Sourcebook. A Comprehensive Guide to Biology and Laboratory Use. Academic Press, San Diego1989: 780-785Google Scholar). Anaerobic Induction of Liquid Cell Suspensions-C. reinhardtii cultures were grown on TAP medium to ∼16-24 μg·ml-1 total chlorophyll, centrifuged (500 ml of cells) at 3,000 × g for 1 min, and the cell pellet resuspended in one-tenth volume (50 ml) of anaerobic induction buffer containing 50 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.2) and 3 mm MgCl2 (26Ghirardi M. Togasaki R. Seibert M. Appl. Biochem. Biotech. 1997; 63-5: 141-151Crossref Google Scholar). The cells were then transferred to a sealed anaerobic vial in the dark and flushed with argon for 30 min. For measuring H2 and O2 production rates, 200 μl of cell cultures were placed in a Clark-type oxygen electrode assay chamber as described previously (6Mus F. Dubini A. Seibert M. Posewitz M.C.

Clark-type oxygen electrodes were used simultaneously to measure light-induced H2 and O2 production rates. To measure fermentative H2 production, 400 μl of head space gas was withdrawn from the sealed anaerobic vials and analyzed by gas chromatography (Hewlett Packard 5890 series II) using a Supelco column (60/80 mol sieve 5A 6 feet × 1/8 inch) coupled to a TCD detector. H2 remaining in solution was quantified using the Clark-type oxygen electrode described above without illumination of the sample chamber. CO2 Measurement-CO2 levels were below detection limits in the serum vial head space of anaerobically acclimated cells. Therefore, following anaerobic induction, 1 ml of anoxic cells was transferred in a gas-tight syringe to a sealed vial into which 1 ml of 1 m HCl was added. The acidified cell suspension was vigorously shaken to liberate CO2, which was quantified by gas chromatography (Hewlett Packard 5890 series II) using a Supelco column (80/100 PORAPAK N 6 feet × 1/8 inch × 2.1 mm) coupled to a TCD detector. Metabolite Analysis-Organic acid analysis was performed by liquid chromatography (Hewlett Packard Series 1050 HPLC) using an Aminex HPX-87H (300 × 7.8 mm) ion exchange column. Dark-adapted cells were collected at the indicated time points and centrifuged (10,000 × g for 1 min), and the supernatant was transferred to a new vial and frozen in liquid N2 for subsequent analysis. Samples were thawed, centrifuged, and filtered prior to HPLC analysis. One hundred μl of cell culture supernatant was injected onto the column and eluted using 8 mm filtered sulfuric acid (J. T. Baker, Inc.) as the mobile phase at a flow rate of 0.5 ml·min-1 at 45 °C. Retention peaks were recorded using Agilent ChemStation software, and quantifications were performed by comparisons with known amounts of standard for each of the organic acids. Ethanol was measured using a YSI 2700 SELECT electrochemical probe (YSI Inc., Yellow Springs, OH). Identical supernatants were used for metabolite and ethanol analysis; 10 μl of the supernatant was required for ethanol analysis. Extraction of RNA-Total RNA was isolated using the Plant RNA reagent, as described by the manufacturer (Invitrogen). Approximately 40 μg of isolated RNA was treated with 5 units of RNase-free DNase (Ambion, Austin, TX) for 30 min at room temperature. The Qiagen RNeasy MinElute kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) was used to purify total RNA. The A260 of the eluted RNA was measured, and 4 μg of purified RNA was reserved to prepare labeled samples for microarray analysis. Reverse Transcriptase Real Time PCR (qPCR)-The abundance of specific transcripts in total mRNA from each sample was quantified by reverse transcriptase real time PCR, designated qPCR, using the Engine Opticon system (Bio-Rad). First strand cDNA synthesis was primed on purified total RNA using specific primers for each C. reinhardtii gene of interest. The specific primers (at 0.5 μm each; supplied by IDT) were annealed to 250 ng of DNA-free total RNA and extended for 1 h at 55 °C using 200 units of the reverse transcriptase Superscript III (Invitrogen). Four μl of the single-stranded cDNA from the reverse transcriptase reaction (final volume, 20 μl) was used as the template for real time PCR amplifications, which were performed using the DyNAmo HS SYBR green reverse transcription-PCR kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Finnzymes, Woburn, MA). Specific primers (0.3 μm) used for amplification were designed to generate amplicons of 100-200 nucleotides. Amplifications were performed using a Bio-Rad iCycler iQ detection system and the following cycling parameters: an initial single step at 95 °C for 10 min (denaturation) followed by 40 cycles of (a) 94 °C for 30 s (denaturation), (b) 56 °C for 45 s (annealing), and (c) 72 °C for 30 s (elongation). Following the 40 cycles, a final elongation/termination step was performed at 72 °C for 10 min. Primers used for qPCR are shown in supplemental Table 1, and were designed using Primer3 software (available on line). The relative expression ratio of a target gene was calculated based on the 2-ΔΔCT method (27Livak K.J. Schmittgen T.D. Methods (San Diego). 2001; 25: 402-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (124148) Google Scholar), using the average cycle threshold (CT) calculated from triplicate measurements. Relative expression ratios from three independent experiments (different experimental replicates) are reported. The level of accumulation of the RACK1 transcript was used as a normalization control because it shows near constant expression under the conditions used in these experiments. Microarray Fabrication-Microarrays were fabricated at the Stanford Functional Genomics Facility at Stanford University, as described previously (6Mus F. Dubini A. Seibert M. Posewitz M.C. Grossman A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 25475-25486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Labeling and Purification of Reverse-transcribed cDNAs-Labeling and purification of reverse-transcribed cDNAs were performed as described previously (28Eberhard S. Jain M. Im C.S. Pollock S. Shrager J. Lin Y. Peek A.S. Grossman A.R. Curr. Genet. 2006; 49: 106-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Briefly, 4 μg of purified RNA was adjusted to 4 μl with sterile MilliQ-treated water. One μl of oligo(dT)-(V) (2 μg·μl-1) was heated for 10 min at 70 °C and quickly chilled on ice. The following reagents were added sequentially to the reaction mixture: 2 μl of 5× superscript buffer; 1 μl of 0.1 m dithiothreitol; 0.2 μl of 50× dNTPs (5 mm dATP, dCTP, and dGTP and 10 mm dTTP); 1 μl of Cy3- or Cy5-dUTP; and 0.8 μl of Superscript III (200 units·μl-1). The final reaction volume was 10 μl. After allowing the reaction to proceed at 42 °C for 2 h, an additional aliquot of 0.5 μl of Superscript III was added, and the reaction was continued for an additional 1 h at 50 °C. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 0.5 μl of 500 mm EDTA and 0.5 μl of 500 mm NaOH, and the solution was incubated at 70 °C for 10 min. Neutralization of the reaction mixture was achieved by adding 0.5 μl of 500 mm HCl. The QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) was used to purify the labeled cDNA as described previously (6Mus F. Dubini A. Seibert M. Posewitz M.C. Grossman A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 25475-25486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Hybridization to the Oligonucleotide Array-Pre-hybridization and hybridization of fluorescent-labeled probes and washing of the arrays were as described previously (6Mus F. Dubini A. Seibert M.

Detailed and updated versions of the protocols used for RNA labeling, slide pre-hybridization, hybridization, and washing can be downloaded from the Chlamydomonas Center website. Scanning, Quantification, and Analysis of the Slides-Microarray slides were scanned for Cy5 and Cy3 fluorescent signals using a GenePix 4000B scanner (Molecular Devices) as described previously (6Mus F. Dubini A. Seibert M. Posewitz M.C. Grossman A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 25475-25486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Spot positions were defined using SpotReader (Niles Scientific). Analyses of the data were performed using GeneSpring 6.1 (Agilent Technologies, Foster City, CA). Images of the fluorescence at 532 nm for Cy3 and 635 nm for Cy5 were recorded and analyzed from the complete array sets (three experimental replicates for the time point 0.5 h, four experimental replicates for the time points 2 and 4 h, and three slides per time point for each experimental replicate, with two copies of each cDNA per slide). Error models were computed based on replicates. Signal ratios were considered to meet threshold criteria if they passed Student’s t test for significance with a p value of ≤0.05. Metabolite Analyses-The C. reinhardtii hydEF-1 mutant lacks hydrogenase activity because of disruption of the HYDEF gene, which encodes a hydrogenase maturase (20Posewitz M.C. King P.W. Smolinski S.L. Zhang L. Seibert M. Ghirardi M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 25711-25720Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). This mutant was used to investigate the physiological responses of C. reinhardtii in the absence of H2 metabolism during anaerobic acclimation. The fermentative products that accumulated in the medium during anoxia in both cultures mutant and parental control are shown in Table 1. Four significant differences observed between mutant and parental cells were as follows: (a) the absence of H2 production in the mutant relative to the parental strain; (b) a marked difference in accumulation of CO2 between the two strains; (c) a slight reduction in the rate of accumulation of formate, acetate, and ethanol in the mutant relative to the parental strain; and (d) elevated production of succinate, only in the mutant. Rescue of the hydEF-1 mutant phenotype and restoration of the fermentation profile (along with H2 and CO2 production) observed in the parental strain was achieved by introduction of a functional copy of the HYDEF gene (data not shown). The complemented strain was not used as a reference in the microarray experiments as integration of the introduced HYDEF gene into the genome could disrupt another cellular function.TABLE 1Concentrations of fermentation products secreted by the Chlamydomonas hydEF-1 mutant and the parental strain, CC-425, following exposure to dark anaerobiosis at the indicated timesFermentation productsTimeCO2H2Formic acidSuccinic acidAcetic acidEthanolhmmol/literCC-4250.5−0.05 ± 0.090.02 ± 0.010.5 ± 0.2BDaBD means below detection.0.9 ± 0.20.2 ± 0.120.14 ± 0.020.03 ± 0.011.3 ± 0.10.1 ± 0.11.5 ± 0.10.7 ± 0.140.64 ± 0.080.06 ± 0.012.2 ± 0.10.1 ± 0.11.8 ± 0.31.1 ± 0.224NDbND means not determined.ND4.8 ± 0.20.1 ± 0.14.3 ± 0.31.9 ± 0.1hydEF-10.5−0.09 ± 0.01BD0.3 ± 0.20.1 ± 0.030.4 ± 0.2BD2−0.09 ± 0.02BD1.0 ± 0.10.2 ± 0.10.7 ± 0.20.4 ± 0.14−0.03 ± 0.01BD1.5 ± 0.10.4 ± 0.21.0 ± 0.20.7 ± 0.124NDND3.5 ± 0.21.2 ± 0.12.0 ± 0.20.8 ± 0.2a BD means below detection.b ND means not determined. Open table in a new tab Succinate is not detected in significant amounts in the medium of the parental culture but does accumulate in the mutant culture, particularly after longer periods (4 and 24 h) of anaerobiosis. CO2 levels do not increase significantly during acclimation to anaerobiosis in the mutant, whereas in parental cells CO2 levels steadily rise over the acclimation period. To account for succinate production and the near constant CO2 level in the mutant, we identified genes on the draft genome encoding enzymes associated with fermentative succinate production. These encoded enzymes were placed into metabolic pathways (Fig. 1) leading to the fermentative production of succinate, which requires the carboxylation of a three-carbon substrate and is consistent with diminished CO2 accumulation in the mutant relative to the parental strain. The proteins associated with the succinate pathways depicted in Fig. 1 are given in Table 2. Because hydrogenase activity is absent in the mutant, pyruvate flux via the pyruvate ferredoxin oxidoreductase (PFR1) pathway is anticipated to be altered because hydrogenase can no longer participate in PFR1/ferredoxin reoxidation. However, it should be noted that additional me"
https://openalex.org/W1993264471,"Astroglia are key cellular sites where opiate drug signals converge with the proinflammatory effects of HIV-1 Tat signals to exacerbate HIV encephalitis. Despite this understanding, the molecular sites of convergence driving opiate-accelerated neuropathogenesis have not been deciphered. We therefore explored potential points of interaction between the signaling pathways initiated by HIV-1 Tat and opioids in striatal astrocytes. Profiling studies screening 152 transcription factors indicated that the nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappaB) subunit, c-Rel, was a likely candidate for Tat or Tat plus opiate-induced increases in cytokine and chemokine production by astrocytes. Pretreatment with the NF-kappaB inhibitor parthenolide provided evidence that Tat+/-morphine-induced release of MCP-1, IL-6 and TNF-alpha by astrocytes is NF-kappaB dependent. The nuclear export inhibitor, leptomycin B, blocked the nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of NF-kappaB; causing p65 (RelA) accumulation in the nucleus, and significantly attenuated cytokine production in Tat+/-morphine exposed astrocytes. Similarly, chelating intracellular calcium ([Ca(2+)](i)) blocked Tat+/-morphine-evoked MCP-1 and IL-6 release, while artificially increasing the concentration of extracellular Ca(2+) reversed this effect. Taken together, these results demonstrate that: 1) exposure to Tat+/-morphine is sufficient to activate NF-kappaB and cytokine production, 2) the release of MCP-1 and IL-6 by Tat+/-morphine are highly Ca(2+)-dependent, while TNF-alpha appears to be less affected by the changes in [Ca(2+)](i), and 3) in the presence of Tat, exposure to opiates augments Tat-induced NF-kappaB activation and cytokine release through a Ca(2+)-dependent pathway."

Although the contribution of atrogin-1 to cardiac and muscle hypertrophy/atrophy has been examined extensively, it remains unclear whether atrogin-1 plays an essential role in the simulated ischemia/reperfusion-induced apoptosis of primary cardiomyocytes. Here we showed that atrogin-1 markedly enhanced ischemia/reperfusion-induced apoptosis in cardiomyocytes via activation of JNK signaling. Overexpression of atrogin-1 increased phosphorylation of JNK and c-Jun and decreased phosphorylation of Foxo3a. In addition, atrogin-1 decreased Bcl-2, increased Bax, and enhanced the activation of caspases. Furthermore, JNK inhibitor SP600125 markedly blocked the effect of atrogin-1 on cell apoptosis and the expression of apoptotic-related proteins and caspases. Importantly, atrogin-1 induced sustained activation of JNK through a mechanism that involved degradation of MAPK phosphatase-1 (MKP-1) protein. Atrogin-1 interacted with and triggered MKP-1 for ubiquitin-mediated degradation. In contrast, proteasome inhibitors markedly blocked the degradation of MKP-1. Taken together, these results demonstrate that atrogin-1 promotes degradation of MKP-1 through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, thereby leading to persistent activation of JNK signaling and further cardiomyocyte apoptosis following ischemia/reperfusion injury.

Apoptosis in cardiac myocytes appears to be an early event and is well recognized to be responsible for myocardial infarction following ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) 2The abbreviations used are: I/R, ischemia/reperfusion; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; MKP-1, MAPK phosphatase-1; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; JNK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase; TUNEL, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated nick end label; GST, glutathione S-transferase; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; siRNA, small interference RNA; MEK, MAPK/ERK kinase.2The abbreviations used are: I/R, ischemia/reperfusion; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; MKP-1, MAPK phosphatase-1; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; JNK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase; TUNEL, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated nick end label; GST, glutathione S-transferase; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; siRNA, small interference RNA; MEK, MAPK/ERK kinase. injury. However, the intracellular signaling pathways that are involved in stimulus recognition and progression to apoptosis in cardiomyocytes following I/R injury remain to be elucidated. It is reported that activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling cascades plays an essential role in this progress (1Michel M.C. Li Y. Heusch G. Naunyn-Schmiedebergs Arch.

Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 2005; 38: 47-62Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). It is believed that activation of p38 is initiated by ischemia and sustained during reperfusion, whereas sustained activation of JNK occurs only during reperfusion and is involved in apoptosis (1Michel M.C.

Although I/R is found to be the activator of apoptosis via JNK activation, the mechanism by which I/R prolongs the JNK activation is not fully understood.MAPKs become activated by dual phosphorylation on Ser/Thr and Tyr residues of TEY sites within the activation loop, whereas dephosphorylation of these residues by MAPK phosphatases (MKPs) terminates such activation (4Chen Q.

Thus, MKPs play an important role in negatively regulating MAPK signaling. MKPs constitute a family of 11 dual-specificity phosphatases that exhibit differential specificity toward MAPK substrates. Among these phosphatases, MKP-1(also known CL100/DUSP1) is identified as the first member of this family (9Charles C.H. Abler A.S. Lau L.F. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 187-190PubMed Google Scholar, 10Lau L.F.

Taken together, these data demonstrate that MKP-1 plays a role in the regulation of stress-responsive JNK-mediated apoptosis.MKP-1 has been reported to be a labile protein whose stabilization can be enhanced by proteasome inhibitors (21Brondello J.M. Pouyssegur J. McKenzie F.R. Science. 1999; 286: 2514-2517Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). Choi et al. reported that activation of PKCδ triggers MKP-1 degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (22Choi B.H. Hur E.M. Lee J.H. Jun D.J. Kim K.T. J. Cell Sci. 2006; 119: 1329-1340Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Furthermore, MKP-1 DEF motif is necessary for active ERK2 binding to initiate site-specific phosphorylation and serves as an essential recognition domain for the Skp1/Cul1/Skp2 (SCFSkp2) ubiquitin ligase complex, leading to MKP-1 polyubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation (23Lin Y.W. Yang J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 915-926Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). More recently, Venugopal et al. (20Venugopal S.K. Chen J. Zhang Y. Clemens D.

Although MKP-1 is degraded by the ubiquitin-proteasome system, there is no evidence indicating that atrogin-1 modulates this process in cardiomyocytes.Atrogin-1/MAFbx is a F-box protein containing an E3 ligase and expressed specifically in striated (cardiac and skeletal) muscle (24Bodine S.C.

Nevertheless, the direct role of atrogin-1 and the downstream targets in cardiomyocyte apoptosis after I/R injury remain unclear.The present study was designed to examine whether the expression of atrogin-1 affects apoptosis of cardiomyocytes in response to I/R. Our findings define the mechanisms by which atrogin-1 promotes MKP-1 degradation through the ubiquitin-proteasome system, thereby enhancing activation of JNK1/2 signaling and cardiomyocyte apoptosis. Overall, these results for the first time show that atrogin-1 is an important mediator in controlling apoptosis of cardiomyocytes following I/R injury.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPlasmids and Reagents—The plasmids Myc-atrogin-1, His-ubiquitin, and GST-atrogin-1 have been described as previously (31Li H.H.

Neonatal rat cardiomyocytes were isolated by enzymatic disassociation of 1- to 2-day-old neonatal rat hearts as described previously (30Li H.H. Kedar V. Zhang C. McDonough H. Arya R. Wang D.Z. Patterson C. J. Clin. Invest. 2004; 114: 1058-1071Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). Recombinant adenoviruses, including Ad-control, Ad-atrogin-1, siRNA-control, and siRNA-atrogin-1 were generated as described previously (30Li H.H. Kedar V. Zhang C. McDonough H. Arya R. Wang D.Z. Patterson C. J. Clin. Invest. 2004; 114: 1058-1071Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). Twenty-four hours after plating, cells were infected with adenovirus vectors containing Ad-atrogin-1 or siRNA-atrogin-1 for 24 h before I/R treatment (30Li H.H. Kedar V. Zhang C. McDonough H. Arya R. Wang D.Z. Patterson C. J. Clin. Invest. 2004; 114: 1058-1071Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar).Simulated I/R Protocol—After 24 h of adenovirus infection, the cells were subjected to simulated ischemia for 1 h by replacing the cell medium with an “ischemia buffer” that contained 118 mm NaCl, 24 mm NaHCO3, 1.0 mm NaH2PO4, 2.5 mm CaCl2-2H2O, 1.2 mm MgCl2, 20 mm sodium lactate, 16 mm KCl, 10 mm 2-deoxyglucose (pH 6.2) as reported previously (32Engelbrecht A.M.

Chem. 2006; 281: 38644-38652Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The cells were incubated in 5% CO2 incubator (37 °C) adjusting 1% O2 during the entire I/R period. Reperfusion was accomplished by replacing the ischemic buffer with normal cell medium under normoxia conditions.Treatment of Cells with Inhibitors—To evaluate the involvement of signaling pathways in atrogin-1-induced apoptosis, cardiomyocytes infected with Ad-atrogin-1 or Ad-control were pretreated for 30 min with SB203580 (p38 inhibitor, 10 μm), SP600125 (JNK inhibitor, 10 μm), U0126 (MEK1/2 inhibitor, 2.5 μm), and wortmannin (phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor, 200 nm) and then subjected to the I/R protocol described above.Cell Viability and TUNEL Assays—Cell viability was determined by Trypan blue exclusion assay (33Das A. Smolenski A. Lohmann S.M. Kukreja R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 38644-38652Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Apoptosis was analyzed by TUNEL staining as reported previously (33Das A. Smolenski A. Lohmann S.M. Kukreja R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 38644-38652Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Cells were counterstained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole and finally examined by fluorescent microscopy. The number of TUNEL-positive cells was analyzed using National Institutes of Health Image software.Western Blot Analysis—Protein samples were prepared from cultured neonatal cardiomyocytes, H9c2 cells using extraction buffer as described previously (30Li H.H. Kedar V. Zhang C. McDonough H. Arya R. Wang D.Z. Patterson C. J. Clin. Invest. 2004; 114: 1058-1071Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). The membranes were incubated with primary antibodies as indicated overnight and then incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody for 1 h. The blots were developed using a chemiluminescent system, and the bands were scanned, and densitometry analysis was performed with Gel-pro 4.5 Analyzer (Media Cybernetics).Immunoprecipitations and GST Pulldown Assays—Immunoprecipitations were performed as described (30Li H.H. Kedar V. Zhang C. McDonough H. Arya R. Wang D.Z. Patterson C. J. Clin. Invest. 2004; 114: 1058-1071Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). Briefly, H9c2 cells were cotransfected with Myc-atrogin-1. Endogenous MKP-1 proteins were immunoprecipitated for 2 h at 4 °C with anti-MKP-1 antibody. The beads were washed and analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-Myc or anti-MKP-1 antibodies. GST fusion protein was prepared, and GST pulldown assays were performed as described previously (30Li H.H. Kedar V. Zhang C. McDonough H. Arya R. Wang D.Z. Patterson C. J. Clin. Invest. 2004; 114: 1058-1071Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). Briefly, H9c2 cells were lysed for 30 min in lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.5% Triton X-100, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm NaF, and protease inhibitors. Lysates were precleared with GST beads for 1 h and incubated with GST or GST-atrogin-1 fusion proteins for 1 h at 4 °C. Protein-bound GST beads were washed with lysis buffer and analyzed by Western blot with anti-MKP-1 antibody.Ubiquitination Assays—H9c2 cells were transfected expression vectors containing His-Ub and Myc-atrogin-1 using Lipofectamine 2000. Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-MKP-1 antibody, and analyzed by Western blot using anti-His, anti-MKP-1 or anti-Myc antibodies as previously described (30Li H.H. Kedar V. Zhang C. McDonough H. Arya R. Wang D.Z. Patterson C. J. Clin. Invest. 2004; 114: 1058-1071Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar).Statistical Analysis—Data are presented as means ± S.E. Differences between groups were evaluated for statistical significance using Student's t test. p < 0.05 was regarded as significant.RESULTSAtrogin-1 Enhances I/R-induced Apoptosis in Neonatal Cardiomyocytes—To investigate the role of atrogin-1 in I/R-induced apoptosis, neonatal cardiomyocytes were infected with Ad-atrogin-1 or Ad-control for 24 h and then were exposed to 1 h of simulated ischemia followed by 24 h reperfusion. As shown in Fig. 1A, TUNEL-positive cells were not significantly different between two groups within 2 h of reperfusion. With an extended reperfusion period of 4 h, TUNEL-positive cells in atrogin-1 infection markedly increased as compared with the control, indicating that atrogin-1 overexpression potentiated I/R-induced apoptosis in cardiomyocytes. To further determine the involvement of endogenous atrogin-1 in apoptosis, cardiomyocytes were infected with siRNA-atrogin-1 or siRNA-control followed by I/R for 24 h. The percentage of TUNEL-positive cells in siRNA-atrogin-1 infection markedly reduced as compared with siRNA-control (Fig. 1, B and C), suggesting that knockdown of atrogin-1 inhibited I/R-induced apoptosis in cardiomyocytes. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that atrogin-1 plays a proapoptotic role in cardiomyocytes following I/R injury.Effect of Atrogin-1 on the Level of Akt, JNK1/2, ERK1/2 and p38 Phosphorylation—To elucidate the signaling pathways involved in atrogin-1-induced cell apoptosis, we first assessed the kinetics of Akt, JNK1/2, ERK1/2, and p38 activities in cardiomyocytes during I/R stimulation. As shown in Fig. 2 (A, C and D), the level of Akt, ERK1/2, and p38 phosphorylation in Ad-atrogin-1 infection was equivalent to that of the control following reperfusion. In contrast, there was a significant increase in the level of JNK1/2 phosphorylation in Ad-atrogin-1 infection and reached a maximum at 24 h of reperfusion as compared with the control (Fig. 2B). These results demonstrate that atrogin-1 selectively up-regulates the activation of JNK1/2 in cardiomyocytes after I/R injury.FIGURE 2Effect of atrogin-1 overexpression on phosphorylation of AKT and MAPKs. A–D, cardiomyocytes were infected and treated as in Fig. 1A. Representative Western blots showed expression levels of total and phospho-Akt, total and phospho-JNK1/2, total and phospho-ERK1/2, and total and phospho-p38 (left panel) in atrogin-1 or vector-expressing cardiomyocytes. The intensity of protein bands was quantified and is shown as the ratio of phosphorylated protein/total protein after normalized by control (GAPDH). Results are expressed as means ± S.E. for three independent experiments. *, p < 0.01; **, p < 0.001 versus Ad-control.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Atrogin-1 Enhances I/R-induced Apoptosis via JNK1/2 Signaling Pathway—To determine the relationship between atrogin-1-induced apoptosis and activation of MAPKs and Akt, cardiomyocytes were treated with p38 inhibitor SB203580, JNK inhibitor SP600125, MEK1/2 inhibitor U0126, and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor wortmannin. The results in Fig. 3A showed that these inhibitors could completely block the phosphorylation of p38, JNK1/2, ERK1/2, and Akt. Interestingly, JNK inhibition with SP600125 only significantly increased the percentage of viable cells and decreased the number of TUNEL-positive cells in atrogin-1 infection as compared with the control (Fig. 3, B and C), suggesting that the JNK pathway is the major factor of atrogin-1-induced apoptosis in cardiomyocytes after I/R injury.FIGURE 3Effect of SB203580, SP600125, U0126, and wortmannin on cardiomyocyte apoptosis. Cardiomyocytes were infected with Ad-control or Ad-atrogin-1 for 24 h, and the inhibitors as indicated were administered 30 min before the onset of ischemia followed 24 h reperfusion. A, representative Western blots show expression levels of total and phospho-p38, total and phospho-JNK1/2, total and phospho-ERK1/2, and total and phospho-Akt. B, cell viability was measured with Trypan blue exclusion assay. Results are expressed as means ± S.E. for three independent experiments. *, p < 0.01 versus Ad-control alone. C, to quantify apoptotic myocytes, cells were fixed and stained with TUNEL. At least 120 cells per dish were counted, and each treatment was performed in triplicate. Results are expressed as means ± S.E. for three independent experiments. *, p < 0.01 versus Ad-control alone.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Atrogin-1 Enhances the Level of c-Jun Phosphorylation—JNK1/2 targets the transcription factor, c-Jun. Overexpression of atrogin-1 clearly increased c-Jun and JNK1/2 phosphorylation compared with the control. In contrast, knockdown of atrogin-1 by siRNA was efficient and decreased the levels of c-Jun and JNK1/2 phosphorylation during I/R stimulation (Fig. 4, A and B).FIGURE 4Atrogin-1 enhances the levels of c-Jun phosphorylation and Foxo3a dephosphorylation. A, cardiomyocytes were infected and treated as in Fig. 1A. The protein levels of atrogin-1, total and phospho-JNK1/2, and total and phospho-c-Jun were examined by Western blotting using indicated antibodies. B, cardiomyocytes were infected and treated as in Fig. 1B. The protein levels of atrogin-1, total and phospho-JNK1/2, and total and phospho-c-Jun were examined as in A. C, cardiomyocytes were infected and treated as in Fig. 1A. The protein levels of total and phospho-Foxo3a were examined by Western blotting using indicated antibodies. D, cardiomyocytes were infected and treated as in Fig. 1B. The protein levels of total and phospho-Foxo3a were examined as in C. A representative blot is shown for each condition.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Atrogin-1 Down-regulates Foxo3a Phosphorylation—Our recent data demonstrate that atrogin-1 decreases Foxo3a phosphorylation and positively regulates Foxo3a activity with lysine 63-linked ubiquitin chains. Thus, we next examined whether atrogin-1 also affects Foxo3a phosphorylation in cardiomyocytes after I/R. Consistent with our previous data (31Li H.H. Willis M.S. Lockyer P. Miller N. McDonough H. Glass D.J. Patterson C. J. Clin. Investig. 2007; 117: 3211-3223Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar), atrogin-1 overexpression resulted in markedly decrease of Foxo3a phosphorylation, whereas depletion of atrogin-1 by siRNA had an opposite effect (Fig. 4, C and D). These results indicate that atrogin-1 also enhances Foxo3a activation.Atrogin-1 Modulates the Expression of Bcl-2, Bax, and Cleaved Caspases through JNK Signaling—To investigate whether atrogin-1 could regulate the expression of apoptosis-related proteins and caspases, cardiomyocytes were infected with Ad-atrogin-1 or siRNA-atrogin-1 and stimulated with I/R. As shown in Fig. 5A and B, overexpression of atrogin-1 markedly decreased the level of Bcl-2 protein, and increased the level of Bax protein, cleaved caspase-9 and caspase-3. In contrast, knockdown of atrogin-1 had an opposite effect. These results indicate that atrogin-1 is involved in the regulation of Bcl-2, Bax, and caspases implicated in cardiomyocyte apoptosis.FIGURE 5Effect of atrogin-1 on the expression of Bcl-2, Bax, cleaved caspase-9, and caspase-3. A, cardiomyocytes were infected with adenovirus vector or atrogin-1 and treated without or with JNK inhibitor SP600125. The protein levels of atrogin-1, JNK-1/2, Bcl-2, Bax, cleaved caspase-9, and caspase-3 were examined by Western blotting. B, cardiomyocytes were infected with adenovirus siRNA-control or siRNA-atrogin-1 and treated without or with JNK inhibitor SP600125. The protein levels of atrogin-1, JNK-1/2, Bcl-2, Bax, cleaved caspase-9, and caspase-3 were examined as in A. A representative blot is shown for each condition.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To explore the mechanisms for atrogin-1 regulating the expression of Bcl-2 and Bax in cardiomyocytes following I/R, we first examined the relationship between atrogin-1 and Bcl-2 or Bax. Coimmunoprecipitation assays demonstrated that atrogin-1 did not directly interact with Bcl-2 or Bax in vivo (data not shown), indicating that Bcl-2 and Bax are not the targets of atrogin-1 in this assay. We therefore tested the involvement of JNK signaling using JNK-specific inhibitor SP600125. As shown in Fig. 5 (A and B), JNK inhibition with SP600125 eventually attenuated JNK phosphorylation and markedly blocked the effect of atrogin-1 on the expression of Bcl-2, Bax, cleaved caspase-9, and caspase-3 compared with the control. These results demonstrate that JNK activation by atrogin-1 functions as an upstream regulator of Bcl-2 and Bax, thereby leading to caspases activation and cell apoptosis.Atrogin-1 Down-regulates the Level of MKP-1 Protein—Because MKP-1 plays a negative regulator of JNK activation, we then determine whether sustained activation of JNK1/2 induced by atrogin-1 is associated with down-regulation of MKP-1 in cardiomyocytes following I/R injury. As shown in Fig. 6A, the level of MKP-1 was significantly increased after 1 h of reperfusion in both atrogin-1 and control groups. However, MKP-1 protein in atrogin-1 infection substantially decreased after 2 h of reperfusion as compared with the control. In contrast, knockdown of endogenous atrogin-1 markedly resulted in the increase of MKP-1 protein level as compared with s"
https://openalex.org/W1990763472,"This work investigates the metabolic origin of triacylglycerol (TAG) formed during lipid droplet (LD) biogenesis induced by stress. Cytotoxic inhibitors of fatty acid synthase induced TAG synthesis and LD biogenesis in CHO-K1 cells, in the absence of external sources of fatty acids. TAG synthesis was required for LD biogenesis and was sensitive to inhibition and down-regulation of the expression of group VIA phospholipase A2 (iPLA2-VIA). Induction of stress with acidic pH, C2-ceramide, tunicamycin, or deprivation of glucose also stimulated TAG synthesis and LD formation in a manner dependent on iPLA2-VIA. Overexpression of the enzyme enhanced TAG synthesis from endogenous fatty acids and LD occurrence. During stress, LD biogenesis but not TAG synthesis required phosphorylation and activation of group IVA PLA2 (cPLA2α). The results demonstrate that iPLA2-VIA provides fatty acids for TAG synthesis while cPLA2α allows LD biogenesis. LD biogenesis during stress may be a survival strategy, recycling structural phospholipids into energy-generating substrates."
https://openalex.org/W2025975633,"Mammalian sperm capacitation is an essential prerequisite to fertilizion. Although progress had been made in understanding the physiology and biochemistry of capacitation, little is known about the potential roles of epididymal proteins during this process. Here we report that HongrES1, a new member of the SERPIN (serine proteinase inhibitor) family exclusively expressed in the rat cauda epididymis and up-regulated by androgen, is secreted into the lumen and covers the sperm head. Co-culture of caudal sperms with HongrES1 antibody in vitro resulted in a significant increase in the percentage of capacitated spermatozoa. Furthermore, the percentage of capacitated spermatozoa clearly increased in rats when HongrES1 was down-regulated by RNAi in vivo. Remarkably, knockdown of HongrES1 in vivo led to reduced fertility accompanied with deformed appearance of fetuses and pups. These results identify HongrES1 as a novel and critical molecule in the regulation of sperm capacitation and male fertility."

Presented here is the crystal structure of the procaspase-1 zymogen without its caspase recruitment domain solved to 2.05 Å. Although the isolated domain is monomeric in solution, the protein appeared dimeric in crystals. The loop arrangements in the dimer provide insight into the first autoproteolytic events that occur during activation by oligomerization. Additionally, in contrast to other caspases, we demonstrate that autoproteolysis at the second cleavage site, Asp316, is necessary for conversion to a stable dimer in solution. Critical elements of secondary structure are revealed in the crystal structure that explain why a dimeric protein is favored after proteolysis at this aspartic acid.

Dimer stabilization is concurrent with a 130-fold increase in kcat, the sole contributing kinetic factor to an activated and efficient mediator of inflammation. Caspases are a family of aspartic acid-specific cysteine proteases that are involved in inflammation and apoptosis. This enzyme family is generally categorized into three groups as follows: inflammatory initiators (caspases-1, -4, and -5), apoptotic initiators (caspases-2, -8, -9, and -10), and apoptotic effectors (caspases-3, -6, and -7). Because of its role as the protease responsible for processing prointerleukin-1β (pro-IL2-1β) to an active 17-kDa form, caspase-1 is a major driver of inflammation and innate immunity (1Black R.A.

The enzyme also participates in the activation of prointerleukin-18 and prointerleukin-33 (4Schmitz J. Owyang A. Oldham E. Song Y. Murphy E. McClanahan T.K. Zurawski G. Moshrefi M. Qin J. Li X.

Caspase-1 activation and the subsequent release of IL-1β, IL-18, and IL-33 are one of the first lines of defense against invading microbes and viruses. Excessive caspase-1 activity, however, can lead to pathologies associated with several autoimmune and inflammatory diseases such as septic shock, inflammatory bowel disease, familial cold autoinflammatory syndrome, rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, and gout (6Joshi V.D.

More recent studies have established the involvement of caspase-1 in neurodegenerative disorders such as trauma and ischemic brain injury, Huntington disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (7Cornelis S. Kersse K. Festjens N. Lamkanfi M. Vandenabeele P. Curr. Pharm. Des. 2007; 13: 367-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Pathways leading to the activation of the enzyme are triggered by diverse pathogen and damage-associated molecular patterns such as lipopolysaccharide, flagellin, DNA, RNA, uric acid crystals, bacterial toxins, and UVB damage (11Petrilli V. Dostert C. Muruve D.A. Tschopp J. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2007; 19: 615-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar). These patterns are often recognized by Toll-like receptors on the cell surface or by nod-like receptors inside the cell. After pattern recognition, intracellular events result in the conversion of the inactive procaspase-1 zymogen to a fully processed, active enzyme. Procaspase-1 conversion is induced by macromolecular oligomerization of the proenzyme onto a complex called the inflammasome (11Petrilli V. Dostert C. Muruve D.A. Tschopp J. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2007; 19: 615-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar, 12Petrilli V. Papin S. Tschopp J. Curr.

Upon complex formation, locally high concentrations of the enzyme result in autoproteolysis at three aspartic acids releasing a fully processed, active enzyme. Natural inhibitors of caspase-1 activation include proteins like ICE-BERG, Pseudo-ICE/COP, CARD-8, and INCA, which all act as decoys to block recruitment of procaspase-1 to the inflammasome complex (15Druilhe A.

Oligomerization plays an important role in activation of apoptotic initiator caspases as well, including human caspase-8 and caspase-9 and the Drosophila initiator-caspase DRONC. An effort to synthetically control caspase-1 activity for therapeutic purposes has resulted in the discovery of potent peptidomimetics that inhibit the enzyme at the active site (20Scheer J.M. Romanowski M.J. O’Brien T. Linton S. Design of Caspase Inhibitors as Potential Clinical Agents. Taylor & Francis Group, Boca Raton, FL2009: 225-250Google Scholar). Typically, these compounds rely on caspase preference for substrate with an aspartic acid-like moiety in the P1 position, but this requirement has restricted the design of these inhibitors to small molecules with undesirable specificity and pharmacodynamics (7Cornelis S. Kersse K. Festjens N. Lamkanfi M. Vandenabeele P. Curr. Pharm. Des. 2007; 13: 367-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Recent structural studies on caspase-1 and caspase-7, however, have shown that allosteric elements can also be targeted by small molecules as an alternative to the active site (21Scheer J.M.

Only two caspase zymogen structures are known, human procaspase-7 and the Drosophila caspase DRONC, an ortholog of human caspase-9 (24Chai J. Wu Q. Shiozaki E. Srinivasula S.M. Alnemri E.S. Shi Y.

These structures and concurrent studies indicate that the mechanisms of activation differ significantly among caspases. Therefore, using a combination of structural and biochemical methods, we sought to elucidate details of procaspase-1 activation and to provide a basis for novel approaches to inhibitor discovery. Caspase Expression in Escherichia coli-Wild-type human caspase-1 (residues 104-404 with the active-site residue Cys285 mutated to Ala) was cloned into pRSET T7 expression vector (Invitrogen) with an N-terminal Unizyme tag (Unizyme Laboratories). The p20 (residues 121-297) and p10 (residues 317-404) subunits were cloned into the pRSET vector without the affinity tags as described previously (21Scheer J.M. Romanowski M.J. Wells J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 7595-7600Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 27Scheer J.M. Wells J.A. Romanowski M.J. Protein Expression Purif. 2005; 41: 148-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Active p35 was cloned into an in-house expression vector pST239 (with supplemental rare tRNA codons ArgU, GlyT, and Pro2) containing an N-terminal Unizyme tag. pRSET vector constructs were expressed in BL21Star(DE3) cells co-transformed with a rare codon plasmid pRARE2 (Novagen), and constructs using the pST239 vector were expressed in 58F3 cells (derived from W3110 with genotype ΔfhuA(ΔtonA) Δlon galE rpoHts(htpRts) ΔclpP lacIq ΔompTΔ(nmpc-fepE) ΔslyD). BL21Star(DE3) cells were grown in Terrific Broth at 37 °C to 1.0 absorbance at A600 nm, induced with 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, and allowed to grow overnight. 58F3 cells were grown in phosphate-limiting media at 30 °C to 2-3 A600 nm before overnight induction with 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (28Simmons L.C. Reilly D. Klimowski L. Raju T.S. Meng G. Sims P. Hong K. Shields R.L. Damico L.A. Rancatore P. Yansura D.G. J. Immunol. Methods. 2002; 263: 133-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). Purification of p35 C285A-Cell pellets were resuspended in 10× volume of 50 mm Tris, pH 8, 300 mm NaCl, and 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol and homogenized with a Polytron cell grinder followed by four passes through a microfluidizer. The lysate was centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was loaded over a 5-ml HisTrap HP column (GE Healthcare) and washed with 50 mm Tris, pH 8, 300 mm NaCl, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol. Bound protein was eluted with a 0-250 mm imidazole gradient. The p35 C285A was pooled, diluted, and passed over a 5-ml Q HP HiTrap column. The mutant p35 was recovered from the unbound flow-through, which yielded pure protein (18 mg of soluble protein per liter of cell culture). Unizyme was removed according to the manufacturer’s protocol, and the protein was dialyzed into 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, and 5 mm DTT prior to crystallography. Purification and Refolding of Active p35-Cell pellets were passed through a Polytron grinder and microfluidizer in 10× volume of 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, and 1 m sodium malonate. The lysate was centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. The pellet was solubilized in 6 m GdnHCl, 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, with 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol using sonication. This extract was centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. Supernatant containing p35 was loaded over a 5-ml HisTrap HP column with 10 mm imidazole, washed with 6 m GdnHCl, 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, and eluted with the addition of 250 mm imidazole. The eluted p35 protein was purified by S75 (GE Healthcare) gel filtration in 6 m GdnHCl, 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, and 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol to remove p24 fragments and other contaminants. Refolding and purification was done as described below for (p20p10)2. The refolded protein was dialyzed into 20 mm acetate, pH 5.0, 100 mm sodium malonate, and 5% glycerol at 4 °C. Subsequent secondary dialysis was done in 20 mm acetate pH 5.0, 30 mm malonate, and 5% glycerol. Purification and Refolding of (p20p10)2-p20 and p10 proteins were refolded at a ratio of 1:1 (2 mg each) by mixing in 50 ml of refold buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 100 mm malonate, 1 m NDSB-201 (nondetergent sulfobetaine-201), 10% sucrose, and 20 mm DTT) as described previously (27Scheer J.M. Wells J.A. Romanowski M.J. Protein Expression Purif. 2005; 41: 148-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Dialysis and purification were done in the presence of 30 mm malonate. Analysis of p35 C285A Processing and Dimerization-p35 C285A p35 was mixed with (p20p10)2 caspase-1 at a final concentration of 143 to 1 μm, respectively, in 100 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 10% sucrose, 0.1% CHAPS, and 10 mm DTT at room temperature. Time points (75 μl of reaction with about 400 μg protein) were centrifuged and analyzed by SEC-MALS (Agilent 1100 high pressure liquid chromatography, Wyatt Technologies miniDawn TriStar, and Optilab DSP). 1 μl of each spun aliquot was also analyzed for protein by SDS-PAGE (4-20% Tris-glycine, Invitrogen). Samples were chromatographed at 1 ml/min in 100 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 10% sucrose, 0.1% CHAPS, and 10 mm DTT over an S200 Superdex 10/300 GL column (GE Healthcare). Autoproteolysis of Active p35-p35 was concentrated to 0.5 mg/ml using VivaSpin 0.5-ml, 5-kDa PES concentrators (Sartorius Stedim) and buffer-exchanged with 4× volume of 100 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 10% sucrose, 0.1% CHAPS, and 10 mm DTT at 4 °C. The protein was brought to room temperature at 0.5 mg/ml, and time points were taken for SDS-PAGE and enzymatic assays. Enzymatic assays were performed at room temperature using reaction buffer (100 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 10% sucrose, 0.1% CHAPS, and 10 mm DTT) and enzyme concentrations of 20 nm. A caspase-1 substrate titration with Ac-WEHD-AFC (MP Biomedicals) was used to determine Km values. The irreversible inhibitor benzyloxycarbonyl-VAD-fluoromethyl ketone (not O-methylated) (AG Scientific) was used for active-site titrations to determine active-site concentrations. A titration of free AFC (Fluka) allowed for calculation of kcat in moles/s. Crystallization, Data Collection, and Analysis-p35 C285A crystallized at 4 °C in hanging drops, consisting of a 1:1 ratio of protein (14 mg/ml) to mother liquor, suspended over mother liquor (0.2 m magnesium chloride, 20% (w/v) PEG 3350). Crystals appeared after 2 weeks and grew to their final size of 75 × 75 × 25 μm in 3 weeks. For data collection, crystals were transferred to cryo-buffer containing mother liquor with 20% (v/v) glycerol and then flash-frozen at N2. Diffraction data were collected from a single crystal at the advanced Light Source (Berkeley, CA) Beamline 5.0.1 to 2.05 Å resolution and was processed using HKL2000 (29Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38253) Google Scholar). The structure was solved using the program PHASER (30McCoy A.J. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Storoni L.C. Read R.J.

Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar) shows some residues in disallowed regions, most of which are found in the poorly ordered section between amino acids 288 and 297. Caspase-1 Monomer to Dimer Conversion-To understand the biochemical and structural details of the caspase-1 activation process, we characterized the p35 C285A mutant form of the enzyme (Fig. 1A). In contrast to purified full-length procaspase-1, which in our hands appeared aggregated (data not shown), the truncated mutant protein could be purified to homogeneity. Analysis by multiple runs of size exclusion chromatography (SEC) coupled with a multiangle laser light scatter (MALS) detection system, a method that allows the measurement of the average molecular mass of eluting peaks, determined that the protein was predominantly monomeric (>98%) even at concentrations greater than 20 mg/ml (∼600 μm). To understand what events convert the monomeric protein to a stable dimer of two processed zymogens ((p20/p10)2), we applied a small amount of active caspase-1 to the inactive protein p35 C285A. The proteolytic patterns observed in this experiment (Fig. 1B) closely resembled those in cell lysates described previously (35Yamin T.T. Ayala J.M. Miller D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13273-13282Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Our results indicate that the first proteolytic event occurs after Asp297 within the large subunit (p20). A second cleavage event then occurs at Asp316 resulting in the loss of the linker between the p20 and p10. The third major proteolytic event at Asp119 then releases the large subunit from a short fragment connecting the enzyme to the CARD (Fig. 1B, upper and middle panels). All digest time points were analyzed by SEC-MALS, and these data show that after 4 h most of the protein has converted to a species with a molecular mass of 60 kDa, which is expected for the processed dimer (Fig. 1B, lower panel). Analysis of protein recovery indicates that at all time points about 400 μg of protein was recovered except for at 24 h, where about half that (200 μg) was recovered. Cleavages after 24 h have occurred at position Asp381 and Asp336 within the p10 subunit accounting for the loss of protein at 24 h and the change in retention time. The actual molar mass of the soluble material based on SEC-MALS analysis is about 45 kDa indicating the loss of a p10 subunit. Autoproteolysis and Enzyme Activity-We expressed and purified p35 with the active-site cysteine present to determine correlations between proteolysis and enzymatic properties. After changing the buffer to activate the enzyme, the p35 shows complete autoproteolysis over a 90-min time period (Fig. 1C). In contrast to the linear rate of digestion observed by treating the inactive protein with a small amount of active enzyme (Fig. 1B), the p35 had a dramatic increase in the rate of autoproteolysis once the cleavage process was initiated. As was seen in the digests of the inactive mutant, the order of processing is Asp297 > Asp316 > Asp119. Using the fluorescent substrate Ac-WEHD-AFC, we determined the kinetic constants, kcat and Km, for the protease at intervals during the processing. The data summarized in Table 1 show that the average Km value of the enzyme remained constant throughout the experiment at ∼4.2 μm, which is equal to the value calculated in other reports (36Garcia-Calvo M. Peterson E.P. Rasper D.M. Vaillancourt J.P. Zamboni R. Nicholson D.W. Thornberry N.A. Cell Death Differ. 1999; 6: 362-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Active-site titrations were done for each time point, which showed that the number of active sites in the activity assays also remained constant with a concentration of ∼7.5 nm. Using a standard curve of free AFC, we calculated the approximate kcat of caspase-1 to be 0.054 s-1 at time 0 min and ∼7 s-1 once fully activated. This represents an ∼130-fold increase in kcat upon autocatalytic processing, the only measurable change in caspase-1 kinetic properties. Importantly, analysis of proteolysis patterns on SDS-PAGE indicated that activity was maximal once the interchain linker was completely removed from the small subunit (Fig. 1C and Table 1).TABLE 1Catalytic properties and cleavage events during the autocatalytic time course of p35 caspase-1Time pointKmkcatkcat/KmAsp297Asp316Asp119minμms−1× 105 m−1 s−1% cleaved% cleaved% cleaved03.80.0540.0143.600156.20.0640.0431000305.30.1030.0202700453.03.9001.30927920604.07.3401.801009674753.96.7201.701009592903.96.8801.8010095971053.36.5602.0010095100 Open table in a new tab Crystal Structure of p35 C285A-The crystals obtained belong to space group P1 and were diffracted to 2.05 Å; the structure was refined to Rfactor/Rfree of 20.1/26.4% (Table 2). Although p35 is monomeric in solution, crystals of p35 contained protein dimers. These dimers display the same general architecture observed in all other crystal structures of caspases to date (37Fuentes-Prior P. Salvesen G.S. Biochem. J. 2004; 384: 201-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (670) Google Scholar). The presence of dimers in the context of protein crystals has been observed in structures for the DRONC zymogen and the processed form of caspase-9, both of which appear predominantly monomeric in solution (24Chai J.

Open table in a new tab In the procaspase-1 structure, we initially modeled residues 126-286 and 307-404 for each monomer. In this model, the 20-residue linker (Ser104-Ser126) connecting the CARD domain to the caspase domain is disordered. It is therefore difficult to predict what role the CARD domain may serve structurally within the zymogen. Interestingly, the Fo - Fc electron density map calculated with this model contained additional density when contoured at 3σ in the center of the dimer, near the noncrystallographic 2-fold axis (Fig. 2A). This electron density, albeit weak and not well defined, indicates the general position of residues 287-298. Because of the symmetric nature of the caspase dimer, it is possible to fit the side chains of Trp294 and Phe295 and neighboring residues of either molecule into the most prominent features of the electron density at the center of the dimer (Fig. 2, A-C). Because of this disorder in the crystals, we modeled residues 287-298 of both molecules with occupancies of 0.5 to indicate that in the crystals the linkers of both molecules occupy the groove in the center of the caspase dimer with about the same probability. Amino acids after Ser298, however, are not defined in the electron density (residues 299-306). SDS-PAGE and N-terminal sequencing analysis of the crystals indicate that the protein was still intact after crystallization (supplemental Fig. S1). In this final model the two molecules are very similar to each other and superimpose with an r.m.s.d. of 0.61 Å for 269 common C-α atoms. Overall, the dimer of p35 C285A is very similar to the structure of the active enzyme (PDB code 1ICE) (42Wilson K.P. Black J.A. Thomson J.A. Kim E.E. Griffith J.P. Navia M.A. Murcko M.A. Chambers S.P. Aldape R.A. Raybuck S.A. Livingston D.J. Nature. 1994; 370: 270-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (751) Google Scholar). The two structures superimpose with an r.m.s.d. of 0.72 Å for 232 C-α positions. However, although the cores of both structures are closely related, there are significant differences at the active-site loops (residues 330-347) that are more like an apo-structure of caspase-1 without an active-site ligand (43Romanowski M.J. Scheer J.M. O'Brien T. McDowell R.S. Structure (Lond.). 2004; 12: 1361-1371Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The putative N terminus of the p10 (residues 314-321) subunit, and the linker residues (285-298) are in unique positions in procaspase-1 compared with other structures of caspase-1 and all other caspases (37Fuentes-Prior P. Salvesen G.S. Biochem. J. 2004; 384: 201-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (670) Google Scholar, 43Romanowski M.J. Scheer J.M. O'Brien T. McDowell R.S. Structure (Lond.). 2004; 12: 1361-1371Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of p35 C285A depicts one possible arrangement of the intact polypeptide chains in procaspase-1 dimers at very high concentrations. This arrangement is likely similar to what occurs during oligomerization on inflammasomes and lends support for a mechanism of activation that occurs through intradimer cleavage. This is observed in the C-terminal region of the large subunit, which is positioned along the dimer interface in a cavity that is normally unoccupied in the ligand-free form of the enzyme (Fig. 3, A and B) (21Scheer J.M.

https://openalex.org/W2069823850,"Proteome studies contribute markedly to our understanding of parasite biology, host-parasite interactions, and mechanisms of drug action. For most antimalarial drugs neither mode of action nor mechanisms of resistance development are fully elucidated although this would be important prerequisites for successfully developing urgently required novel antimalarials. Here, we establish a large-scale quantitative proteomic approach to examine protein expression changes in trophozoite stages of the malarial parasite Plasmodium falciparum following chloroquine and artemisinin treatment. For this purpose SIL (stable isotope labeling) using 14N-isoleucine and 13C6,15N1-isoleucine was optimized to obtain 99% atomic percent enrichment. Proteome fractionation with anion exchange chromatography was used to reduce sample complexity and increase quantitative coverage of protein expression. Tryptic peptides of subfractions were subjected to SCX/RP separation, measured by LC-MS/MS and quantified using the novel software tool Census. In drug treated parasites, we identified a total number of 1,253 proteins, thus increasing the overall number of proteins identified in the trophozoite stage by 30%. A relative quantification was obtained for more than 800 proteins. Under artemisinin and chloroquine treatment 41 and 38 proteins respectively were upregulated (>1.5) whereas 14 and 8 proteins were down-regulated (<0.5). Apart from specifically regulated proteins we also identified sets of proteins which were regulated as a general response to drug treatment. The proteomic data was confirmed by Western blotting. The methodology described here allows for the efficient large-scale differential proteome analysis of P. falciparum to study the response to drug treatment or environmental changes. Only 100 µg of protein is required for the analysis suggesting that the method can also be transferred to other apicomplexan parasites."
https://openalex.org/W2063552704,"Background In mammals, genetically-directed cell labeling technologies have not yet been applied to the morphologic analysis of neurons with very large and complex arbors, an application that requires extremely sparse labeling and that is only rendered practical by limiting the labeled population to one or a few predetermined neuronal subtypes. Methods and Findings In the present study we have addressed this application by using CreER technology to non-invasively label very small numbers of neurons so that their morphologies can be fully visualized. Four lines of IRES-CreER knock-in mice were constructed to permit labeling selectively in cholinergic or catecholaminergic neurons [choline acetyltransferase (ChAT)-IRES-CreER or tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)-IRES-CreER], predominantly in projection neurons [neurofilament light chain (NFL)-IRES-CreER], or broadly in neurons and some glia [vesicle-associated membrane protein2 (VAMP2)-IRES-CreER]. When crossed to the Z/AP reporter and exposed to 4-hydroxytamoxifen in the early postnatal period, the number of neurons expressing the human placental alkaline phosphatase reporter can be reproducibly lowered to fewer than 50 per brain. Sparse Cre-mediated recombination in ChAT-IRES-CreER;Z/AP mice shows the full axonal and dendritic arbors of individual forebrain cholinergic neurons, the first time that the complete morphologies of these very large neurons have been revealed in any species. Conclusions Sparse genetically-directed, cell type-specific neuronal labeling with IRES-creER lines should prove useful for studying a wide variety of questions in neuronal development and disease."

However, the role of SpeB in the course of infection is still unclear. In this study we utilize a SpeB-negative M1T1 clinical isolate, 5628, with a naturally occurring mutation in the gene encoding the regulator RopB, to elucidate the role of RopB and SpeB in systemic virulence. Allelic exchange mutagenesis was used to replace the mutated ropB allele in 5628 with the intact allele from the well characterized isolate 5448. The inverse allelic exchange was also performed to replace the intact ropB in 5448 with the mutated allele from 5628. An intact ropB was found to be essential for SpeB expression. While the ropB mutation was shown to have no effect on hemolysis of RBC's, extracellular DNase activity or survival in the presence of neutrophils, strains with the mutated ropB allele were less virulent in murine systemic models of infection. An isogenic SpeB knockout strain containing an intact RopB showed similarly reduced virulence. Microarray analysis found genes of the SpeB operon to be the primary target of RopB regulation. These data show that an intact RopB and efficient SpeB production are necessary for systemic infection with GAS."
https://openalex.org/W2002308984,"DNA topoisomerase II (topo II) catalyzes a strand passage reaction in that one duplex is passed through a transient brake or gate in another. Completion of late stages of neuronal development depends on the presence of active β isoform (topo IIβ). The enzyme appears to aid the transcriptional induction of a limited number of genes essential for neuronal maturation. However, this selectivity and underlying molecular mechanism remains unknown. Here we show a strong correlation between the genomic location of topo IIβ action sites and the genes it regulates. These genes, termed group A1, are functionally biased towards membrane proteins with ion channel, transporter, or receptor activities. Significant proportions of them encode long transcripts and are juxtaposed to a long AT-rich intergenic region (termed LAIR). We mapped genomic sites directly targeted by topo IIβ using a functional immunoprecipitation strategy. These sites can be classified into two distinct classes with discrete local GC contents. One of the classes, termed c2, appears to involve a strand passage event between distant segments of genomic DNA. The c2 sites are concentrated both in A1 gene boundaries and the adjacent LAIR, suggesting a direct link between the action sites and the transcriptional activation. A higher-order chromatin structure associated with AT richness and gene poorness is likely to serve as a silencer of gene expression, which is abrogated by topo IIβ releasing nearby genes from repression. Positioning of these genes and their control machinery may have developed recently in vertebrate evolution to support higher functions of central nervous system."
https://openalex.org/W2035244922,"Mammalian homolog of Drosophila diaphanous (mDia) consisting of three isoforms, mDia1, mDia2, and mDia3, is an effector of Rho GTPases that catalyzes actin nucleation and polymerization. Although the mDia actions on actin dynamics in the cytoplasm have been well studied, whether mDia accumulates and functions in the nucleus remains largely unknown. Given the presence of actin and actin-associated proteins in the nucleus, we have examined nuclear localization of mDia isoforms. We expressed each of mDia isoforms as a green fluorescent protein fusion protein and examined their localization. Although all the mDia isoforms were localized predominantly in the cytoplasm under the steady-state conditions, mDia2 and not mDia1 or mDia3 accumulated extensively in the nucleus upon treatment with leptomycin B (LMB), an inhibitor of CRM1-dependent nuclear export. The LMB-induced nuclear accumulation was confirmed for endogenous mDia2 by using an antibody specific to mDia2. Studies using green fluorescent protein fusions of various truncation mDia2 mutants and point mutants of some of these proteins identified a functional nuclear localization signal in the N terminus of mDia2 and at least one functional nuclear export signal in the C terminus. The nuclear localization signal of mDia2 bound to importin-α and was imported into the nucleus by importin-α/β complex in an in vitro transport assay. Consistently, depletion of importin-β with RNA interference suppressed the LMB-induced nuclear localization of endogenous mDia2. These results suggest that mDia2 continuously shuttles between the nucleus and the cytoplasm using specific nuclear transport machinery composing of importin-α/β and CRM1. Mammalian homolog of Drosophila diaphanous (mDia) consisting of three isoforms, mDia1, mDia2, and mDia3, is an effector of Rho GTPases that catalyzes actin nucleation and polymerization. Although the mDia actions on actin dynamics in the cytoplasm have been well studied, whether mDia accumulates and functions in the nucleus remains largely unknown. Given the presence of actin and actin-associated proteins in the nucleus, we have examined nuclear localization of mDia isoforms. We expressed each of mDia isoforms as a green fluorescent protein fusion protein and examined their localization. Although all the mDia isoforms were localized predominantly in the cytoplasm under the steady-state conditions, mDia2 and not mDia1 or mDia3 accumulated extensively in the nucleus upon treatment with leptomycin B (LMB), an inhibitor of CRM1-dependent nuclear export. The LMB-induced nuclear accumulation was confirmed for endogenous mDia2 by using an antibody specific to mDia2. Studies using green fluorescent protein fusions of various truncation mDia2 mutants and point mutants of some of these proteins identified a functional nuclear localization signal in the N terminus of mDia2 and at least one functional nuclear export signal in the C terminus. The nuclear localization signal of mDia2 bound to importin-α and was imported into the nucleus by importin-α/β complex in an in vitro transport assay. Consistently, depletion of importin-β with RNA interference suppressed the LMB-induced nuclear localization of endogenous mDia2. These results suggest that mDia2 continuously shuttles between the nucleus and the cytoplasm using specific nuclear transport machinery composing of importin-α/β and CRM1. Subcellular localization of a protein must be accurately regulated for the protein to function in a proper compartment of a cell. As for the nucleus, some proteins such as transcription factors and those associated with chromatin are translocated to the nucleus after they are synthesized in the cytoplasm. Other proteins enter the nucleus and then come back to the cytoplasm. Ribosomal proteins, for example, are integrated into large (60 S) and small (40 S) ribosomal subunits in the nucleus and then transported back to the cytoplasm to function as translation machineries (1Zemp I.

There are also a group of proteins named nucleocytoplasmic shuttling proteins that shuttle between the nucleus and the cytoplasm. The nucleus and the cytoplasm are separated by the nuclear membrane containing nuclear pores. Molecules less than ∼50 kDa can diffuse passively through the nuclear pore, whereas larger molecules require selective transport mechanism(s) to pass through the pore (4Keminer O. Peters R. Biophys J. 1999; 77: 217-228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). This selective nuclear transport mechanism depends on specific amino acid sequences of substrate proteins named the nuclear localization signal (NLS) 2The abbreviations used are: NLS, nuclear localization signal; NES, nuclear export signal; mDia, mammalian homolog of Drosophila diaphanous; LMB, leptomycin B; GBD, GTPase binding domain; FH, formin homology; DAD, diaphanous autoregulatory domain; F-actin, filamentous actin; G-actin, globular/monomer actin; PK, pyruvate kinase; GFP, green fluorescent protein; GST, glutathione S-transferase; siRNA, small interfering RNA; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline.2The abbreviations used are: NLS, nuclear localization signal; NES, nuclear export signal; mDia, mammalian homolog of Drosophila diaphanous; LMB, leptomycin B; GBD, GTPase binding domain; FH, formin homology; DAD, diaphanous autoregulatory domain; F-actin, filamentous actin; G-actin, globular/monomer actin; PK, pyruvate kinase; GFP, green fluorescent protein; GST, glutathione S-transferase; siRNA, small interfering RNA; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline. for import to the nucleus and the nuclear export signal (NES) for export to the cytoplasm, both of which are recognized typically by the importin-β family of receptors (5Gorlich D. Mattaj I.W. Science. 1996; 271: 1513-1518Crossref PubMed Scopus (1061) Google Scholar). Rho GTPases regulate actin cytoskeleton through actions of their downstream effectors (6Jaffe A.B. Hall A. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2005; 21: 247-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (2298) Google Scholar). mDia is an effector of Rho and catalyzes actin nucleation and polymerization to produce straight actin filaments (7Watanabe N. Madaule P. Reid T. Ishizaki T. Watanabe G. Kakizuka A. Saito Y. Nakao K. Jockusch B.M. Narumiya S. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3044-3056Crossref PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar), which are cross-linked by myosin to become stress fibers by the action of another Rho effector, ROCK (8Watanabe N. Kato T. Fujita A. Ishizaki T. Narumiya S. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 136-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar). mDia consists of several conserved domains: the GTPase binding domain (GBD) at the N terminus, the formin homology (FH) domains, FH3, FH1, and FH2, in this order, in the middle, and the diaphanous autoregulatory domain (DAD) at the C terminus (Ref. 9Higgs H.N. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2005; 30: 342-353Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar and Fig. 2). The FH2 domain makes a dimmer, binds to the barbed end of filamentous actin (F-actin), and catalyzes actin nucleation and polymerization there, whereas the neighboring FH1 domain binds profilin, a globular/monomer actin (G-actin)-binding protein, and promotes actin polymerization by FH2 domain possibly by raising local G-actin concentration (8Watanabe N. Kato T. Fujita A. Ishizaki T. Narumiya S. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 136-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar, 10Kovar D.R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2006; 18: 11-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Without activation by Rho, the GBD and the DAD physically interact, making the FH1 and FH2 domains structurally unavailable for actin nucleation and polymerization (11Li F. Higgs H.N. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 1335-1340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). Binding of the GTP-bound form of Rho to the GBD disrupts the intramolecular interaction and makes mDia in a structurally open active form. There are three isoforms for mDia, i.e. mDia1, mDia2, and mDia3 (7Watanabe N. Madaule P. Reid T. Ishizaki T. Watanabe G. Kakizuka A. Saito Y. Nakao K. Jockusch B.M. Narumiya S.

All of them are capable of actin nucleation and polymerization. One of the reported functions of an mDia isoform is regulation of serum response factor activity (14Copeland J.W. Treisman R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 4088-4099Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). MAL, a coactivator of serum response factor, interacts with G-actin both in the cytoplasm and the nucleus, and its interaction with G-actin favors its cytoplasmic localization and suppresses transcription activation (15Miralles F. Posern G. Zaromytidou A.I. Treisman R. Cell. 2003; 113: 329-342Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1019) Google Scholar, 16Vartiainen M.K. Guettler S. Larijani B. Treisman R. Science. 2007; 316: 1749-1752Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar). Rho signaling regulates the nuclear localization of MAL through the control of actin dynamics. mDia1 has been shown to activate serum response factor by decreasing the G-actin level by actin polymerization (14Copeland J.W. Treisman R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 4088-4099Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar), implying the involvement of mDia1 in MAL localization. These results indicate that alteration in actin dynamics by mDia isoforms can influence some of the nuclear functions. Whether mDia1 or other mDia isoforms exert such an action by acting solely in the cytoplasm or acting also in the nucleus remains unknown. Some actin-polymerizing proteins such as FHOD1 (17Menard I. Gervais F.G. Nicholson D.W. Roy S. Apoptosis. 2006; 11: 1863-1876Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) and N-WASP (18Suetsugu S. Takenawa T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 42515-42523Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) have been reported to enter the nucleus. Here we have examined whether and, if so, how mDia isoforms enter the nucleus. We show that mDia2 continuously shuttles between the nucleus and the cytoplasm in a manner dependent on the NLS and the NES.

Amino acid substitution mutants were created by the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) using appropriate primers. Expression and Purification of Recombinant Proteins—A GST-GFP or GST-GFP-mDia2-(16-39) expression plasmid was introduced into an Escherichia coli strain BL21. Expression was induced by the addition of 0.5 μm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside and incubated for 24 h at 20 °C. Cells were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in a high salt buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 500 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol) containing Protease Inhibitor mixture (Nacalai Tesque). After sonication, the extract was clarified by centrifugation. The supernatant was incubated with glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Biosciences) in 10 ml of the high salt buffer containing 0.05% Triton X-100 for 2 h at 4 °C with gentle agitation. After washing with the high salt buffer, the protein was eluted from the beads with elution buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 20 mm glutathione). The protein fraction was subjected to a PD-10 Desalting column (GE Healthcare) for exchange to the binding buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol) and was concentrated using a Amicon Ultra centrifugal filter (Millipore). FLAG-importin-α1, HA-importin-β, Ran, and NTF2 were expressed and purified as described previously (21Sekimoto T. Fukumoto M. Yoneda Y. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 1934-1942Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Cell Culture and Transfection—HeLa cells were incubated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Sigma) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum at 37 °C in an atmosphere containing 5% CO2. Expression plasmids for GFP-fused proteins were transfected using the Effectene Transfection reagent (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. At 20 h after the transfection, leptomycin B (LMB, LC Laboratories) was added to medium to a final concentration of 10 nm for 30-90 min, depending on experiments. The cells were observed under a Leica AS MDW fluorescence microscope. RNA Interference—siRNAs for depletion of importin-β1 were obtained from Invitrogen. siImpβ-1, siImpβ-2, and siImpβ-3 were designed to target the nucleotide number 2497-2521, 2638-2662, and 497-521 of human importin-β mRNA (GenBank™ accession no. NM_002265), respectively. As a negative control siRNA, Stealth™ RNAi Negative Control Medium GC Duplex 2 (Invitrogen) was used. siRNAs were transfected into HeLa cells using the Lipofectamine RNAiMax reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Cells were incubated for 48 h with exchange of the medium once at 24 h after transfection. Cells were then harvested and subjected to Western blot analysis using a goat anti-importin-β antibody (Santa Cruz) and a mouse monoclonal anti-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase antibody (Ambion). Immunofluorescence—All procedures were performed at room temperature. After the LMB treatment, HeLa or NIH3T3 cells were fixed with 4% formaldehyde in PBS for 15 min and then permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS for 10 min. The cells were blocked with 3% skim milk in PBS for 1 h followed by incubation in the same solution containing rabbit anti-mDia2 antibody (20Watanabe S. Ando Y. Yasuda S. Hosoya H. Watanabe N. Ishizaki T. Narumiya S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2008; 19: 2328-2338Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) for 1 h. After washing 3 times with PBS, the cells were incubated with Alexa 488-labeled donkey anti-mouse IgG (Molecular Probes) in the blocking solution for 1 h. The cells were then washed 5 times with PBS and observed using a ZEISS LSM 510 microscope equipped with a 40× NA1.4 objective lens at a wavelength of 488 nm in conjunction with a filter of BP505-530. Microinjection—Two mg/ml purified GST-GFP or GST-GFP-mDia2-(16-39) protein with 0.5 mg/ml of Alexa594-labeled donkey anti-mouse IgG (Molecular Probes) was microinjected into the cytoplasm of HeLa cells. After incubation at 37 °C for 60 min, cells were observed under a fluorescence microscope. In Vitro Transport Assay—An in vitro transport assay was performed as described previously (22Nagoshi E. Imamoto N. Sato R. Yoneda Y. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 2221-2233Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Briefly, HeLa cells were plated on a slide glass. Cells were rinsed twice in an ice-cold transport buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.3, 110 mm potassium acetate, 2 mm magnesium acetate, 5 mm sodium acetate, 0.5 mm EGTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol) and permeabilized for 5 min in ice-cold transport buffer containing 40 mg/ml digitonin and washed. A recombinant GST-GFP-mDia2-(16-39) protein combined with Ehrlich cytosol or ATP regeneration system containing Ran and NTF2 proteins was added to the cells. After incubation at 30 °C for 30 min, cells were fixed and observed under a fluorescence microscope. In Vitro Binding Assay—Purified FLAG-importin-α1 (20 μg) and GST-GFP (60 μg) or GST-GFP-mDia2-(16-39) (60 μg) were mixed in 300 μl of the binding buffer containing 0.05% Triton X-100 in the presence of anti-Flag M2 agarose (Sigma) at 4 °C for 2 h. After extensive washing, bound proteins were eluted with 80 μl of the binding buffer containing 200 μg/ml 3× FLAG peptide (Sigma) and applied on SDS-PAGE followed by staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue or Western blotting using rabbit anti-FLAG antibody (Sigma) and rabbit anti-GFP antibody (Santa Cruz). Selective Nuclear Accumulation of mDia2 upon Leptomycin B Treatment—To examine subcellular localization of each mDia isoform, we expressed them as a GFP fusion protein in HeLa cells and examined their localization by GFP fluorescence. All the GFP-fused mDia isoforms are localized predominantly in the cytoplasm in cells at steady state (Fig. 1A). Two mechanisms underlie the predominant cytoplasmic localization of proteins; one is the size limitation by nuclear pores, which prohibits the passage of greater than 50-kDa molecules through the pore by passive diffusion (4Keminer O. Peters R. Biophys J. 1999; 77: 217-228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar), and the other is the selective nuclear export system, which recognizes a NES in substrate proteins and carries them out of the nucleus to the cytoplasm. The majority of proteins to be exported from the nucleus are exported by a nuclear export factor, CRM1, which recognizes the NES of these proteins (23Kudo N. Wolff B. Sekimoto T. Schreiner E.P. Yoneda Y. Yanagida M. Horinouchi S. Yoshida M. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 242: 540-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (700) Google Scholar). Because the molecular mass of mDia isoforms is more than 100 kDa, both mechanisms are possible. To examine this point, we used LMB, which specifically inhibits CRM1. We treated HeLa cells expressing each GFP-mDia isoform with LMB and examined their localization. Upon LMB treatment, mDia2, and not mDia1 or mDia3, accumulated in the nucleus (Fig. 1A). We also used an antibody specific to mDia2 and examined whether endogenous mDia2 also accumulates in the nucleus upon LMB treatment. We found nuclear accumulation of endogenous mDia2 upon LMB treatment in both HeLa and NIH3T3 cells (Fig. 1B), suggesting that the LMB-induced nuclear accumulation of mDia2 is not an artifact of GFP-fusion proteins and is not restricted to a specific cell type or species. We also wondered whether the LMB-induced nuclear accumulation reflects the active or inactive state of each mDia isoform. To address this question, we constructed structurally open active mutants of mDia isoforms by substitution of a specific Met residue, Met-1182 in mDia1, Met-1041 in mDia2, and Met-1053 in mDia3, in DAD for Ala and expressed these mutants as GFP fusion in HeLa cells (24Alberts A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2824-2830Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). GFP-mDia2-(M1041A) again showed nuclear accumulation upon LMB treatment, whereas mDia1-(M1182A) did not show nuclear accumulation with or without LMB treatment. mDia3-(M1053A) was localized in the cytoplasm in most of the cells like mDia1 mutant but localized in a small population of cells in the nucleus with or without LMB treatment (supplemental Fig. S1). These results that mDia2 selectively accumulates in the nucleus upon LMB treatment indicate that mDia2 and not mDia1 or mDia 3 somehow enters the nucleus and is then exported by the CRM1-dependent mechanism. Analysis of mDia2 Regions Involved in Nuclear Localization and Nuclear Export—The above results suggest that mDia2 actively shuttles between the nucleus and the cytoplasm whether or not it is structurally open. Most nucleocytoplasmic shuttling proteins have NLS and NES in their own sequence. To identify NLS and NES in mDia2, we produced various truncation mutants of mouse mDia2 as GFP fusion proteins and analyzed their subcellular localization and their behavior upon LMB treatment. Each of truncation mutants of mDia2 was expressed in HeLa cells, and their localization was observed (Fig. 2). The N terminus deletion mutant, mDia2-(33-1171), was localized in the cytoplasm even after LMB treatment, indicating that the N terminus of mDia2 is responsible for the nuclear localization. Consistently, mDia2-(1-60), mDia2-(1-41), and mDia2-(1-32) were localized exclusively in the nucleus. Notably, mDia2-(1-153) was also predominantly localized in the nucleus, whereas mDia2-(1-411) was localized in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus, and LMB treatment induced the nuclear accumulation of mDia2-(1-411). The behaviors of the latter two truncation mutants suggest that the region spanning from the middle of GBD to the middle of FH3 is involved in the CRM1-dependent nuclear export. We also examined in other regions for NES. The mutant complementary to mDia2-(1-411), mDia2-(411-1171), was not localized in the nucleus even in the presence of LMB, indicating that this protein cannot enter the nucleus. This is probably because it lacks NLS and is of a large size (87 kDa) and prevented us from examining whether this mutant contains NES for CRM1. We, therefore, attached the NLS of SV40 T-antigen to the N terminus of mDia2 -(411-1171) (NLS-mDia2-(411-1171)) (25Kalderon D. Roberts B.L. Richardson W.D. Smith A.E. Cell. 1984; 39: 499-509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1843) Google Scholar). We found that NLS-mDia2-(411-1171) was localized in the cytoplasm and accumulated in the nucleus upon LMB treatment. A shorter mutant, NLS-mDia2-(411-966), was localized in the nucleus without LMB treatment, suggesting the involvement of the C-terminal region of mDia2 in the CRM1-dependent nuclear export. Consistently, a short C-terminal fragment, mDia2-(1028-1171), changed the localization from the cytoplasm to the nucleus upon LMB treatment. These results indicate that the C terminus of mDia2 is the second region responsible for the nuclear export by CRM1. We also noted that another C-terminal fragment, mDia2-(1028-1156), was localized predominantly in the nucleus without LMB treatment. Given that mDia2-(1028-1156) does not contain NLS and GFP-fused mDia2-(1028-1156) was small (44 kDa), it is likely that this protein enters the nucleus by passive diffusion and is retained in the nucleus by interaction with some nuclear structure or protein. mDia2 Has at Least One Functional NES Recognized by CRM1—It is well known that NESs recognized by CRM1 are composed of a stretch of characteristically spaced hydrophobic amino acids such as ΦX2-3ΦX2-3ΦXΦ (Φ = Leu, Ile, Val, Phe, or Met; X is any amino acid) (26Kutay U. Guttinger S. Trends Cell Biol. 2005; 15: 121-124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar), as was first reported for the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 Rev (LPPLERLTL) (27Fischer U. Huber J. Boelens W.C. Mattaj I.W. Luhrmann R. Cell. 1995; 82: 475-483Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (976) Google Scholar) and PKI (LALKLAGLDI) (28Wen W. Meinkoth J.L. Tsien R.Y. Taylor S.S. Cell. 1995; 82: 463-473Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (991) Google Scholar) proteins. Four NES-like sequences are present in the regions that were shown above to be involved in the nuclear export of mDia2, three in GBD and one at the C terminus, designated as NES-like 1-3 and NES-like 4, respectively (Fig. 3A). To examine whether these sequences function as NES recognized by CRM1, each of them was fused to GFP and expressed in HeLa cells. As shown in Fig. 3B, although these fusion proteins were small and expected to enter the nucleus by passive diffusion, fusion proteins of NES-like 3 and 4, not those of NES-like 1 and 2, were localized predominantly in the cytoplasm. The LMB treatment converted their predominant cytoplasmic localization to diffuse intracellular distribution (Fig. 3B) as shown for GFP alone (see for example Fig. 2), indicating NES-like 3 and 4 are recognized, and the GFP carrying these sequences are exported from the nucleus by CRM1. To confirm that these sequence function as NES in mDia2, we introduced point mutations into the hydrophobic amino acids in these sequences of GFP-fused mDia2-(1-411) and NLS-mDia2-(411-1171) and examined the localization (Fig. 3C). GFP-NLS-mDia2-(411-1171) (L1168G) accumulated in the nucleus, suggesting that NES-like 4 functions as NES of mDia2. On the other hand, GFP-mDia2-(1-411)(V268A/V269A) and GFP-mDia2-(1-411)(V274G/V276G) were still localized in both the nucleus and the cytoplasm and accumulated in the nucleus upon LMB treatment. These findings suggest that the NES-like 3 does not function as a NES in intact protein and/or that there is an additional CRM1-dependent mechanism in this fragment. Finally, to examine contribution of the NES at the C terminus to nuclear export of the full-length protein, we introduced a L1168G mutation into full-length mDia2 (mDia2(L1168G)) and examined its behavior. GFP-fused mDia2(L1168G) was localized in the cytoplasm and accumulated in the nucleus upon LMB treatment (Fig. 3C). These results suggest that without NES-like 4, mDia2 can be exported by the CRM1-dependent manner possibly using its N-terminal region. mDia2 H"

For reasons that are not well elucidated, circulating leukocytes are recruited into the tissues mainly in small vessels such as capillaries and venules. Because ELR(+) CXC chemokines are important mediators of endothelial-leukocyte interaction, we compared chemokine expression by microvascular and aortic endothelium to investigate whether differences in chemokine expression by various endothelial types could, at least partially, explain the microvascular localization of endothelial-leukocyte interaction. Both in vitro and in vivo models indicate that ELR(+) CXC chemokine expression is higher in microvascular endothelium than in aortic endothelial cells. These differences can be explained on the basis of the preferential activation of endothelial chemokine production by low intensity shear stress. Low shear activated endothelial ELR(+) CXC chemokine production via cell surface heparan sulfates, beta(3)-integrins, focal adhesion kinase, the mitogen-activated protein kinase p38beta, mitogen- and stress-associated protein kinase-1, and the transcription factor."
https://openalex.org/W2020439035,"Ubiquitination plays a major role in regulating cell surface and intracellular localization of major histocompatibility complex class II molecules. Two E3 ligases, MARCH I and MARCH VIII, have been shown to polyubiquitinate lysine residue 225 in the cytoplasmic tail of I-Aβ and HLA-DRβ. We show that lysine residue 219 in the cytoplasmic tail of DRα is also subject to polyubiquitination. Each chain of the HLA-DR heterodimer is independently recognized and ubiquitinated, but DRβ is more extensively modified. In the cytoplasmic tail of DRβ lysine, residue 225 is the only residue that is absolutely required for ubiquitination; all other residues can be deleted or substituted without loss of function. In contrast, although lysine 219 is absolutely required for modification of DRα, other features of the DRα tail act to limit the extent of ubiquitination.

Major histocompatibility complex (MHC) 3The abbreviations used are: MHC, major histocompatibility complex; Ub, ubiquitin; Ii, invariant chain; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; E3, ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; HA, hemagglutinin; FACS, fluorescence-activated cell sorting; HRP, horseradish peroxidase; GFP, green fluorescent protein. class II molecules play an essential role in adaptive immune responses through the presentation of antigenic peptides to CD4-restricted T helper cells. MHC class II molecules are subject to complex post-translational control. During biosynthesis, the class II α and β chains assemble in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) with the chaperone protein invariant chain (Ii). This prevents association with ER-derived peptides, facilitates folding of the class II molecule, and targets the complex to endocytic compartments, called MHC class II-containing compartments (1Peters P.J. Neefjes J.J. Oorschot V. Ploegh H.L. Geuze H.J. Nature. 1991; 349: 669-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar). Within the endocytic pathway, Ii is sequentially cleaved, leaving a short peptide fragment, CLIP, in the peptide binding groove (2Cresswell P. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1992; 4: 87-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). With guidance from the class II-related chaperone HLA-DM, CLIP is removed, and the class II molecules are loaded with an array of peptides derived from proteins that have accessed the endocytic pathway (3Denzin L.K. Cresswell P. Cell. 1995; 82: 155-165Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar). There is considerable debate concerning the route of trafficking of class II to peptide loading compartments. Both direct targeting from the trans-Golgi network and indirect targeting from the cell surface have been proposed (4Watts C. Nat. Immunol. 2004; 5: 685-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 5Hiltbold E.M. Roche P.A. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2002; 14: 30-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The precise nature of the peptide-loading compartment has been subject to extensive investigation. Both early and late endocytic compartments have been proposed as sites of class II peptide acquisition. However, it is generally concluded that the peptide loading compartment should contain the chaperone HLA-DM, MHC class II that is devoid of intact Ii, antigenic peptide, and appropriate proteases (6Neefjes J. Eur. J. Immunol. 1999; 29: 1421-1425Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Detailed localization of class II molecules within MHC class II-containing compartment-loading compartments has also been investigated, and although class II and DM are present on both limiting and internal membranes, their interaction and hence peptide loading is restricted to the internal membranes (7van Lith M. van Ham M.

Once loaded with antigenic peptide, class II must access the cell surface for presentation to T cells, and again the mechanisms governing this are poorly understood. MHC class II expression is a defining feature of professional antigen-presenting cells, and post-translational targeting is under stringent control, particularly in dendritic cells. When pattern recognition receptors on antigen-presenting cells encounter ligands such as lipopolysaccharide, subsequent signaling results in redistribution of the intracellular pool of class II to the cell surface. This is controlled through regulated ubiquitination of the class II β chain (9Shin J.S. Ebersold M. Pypaert M. Delamarre L. Hartley A. Mellman I. Nature. 2006; 444: 115-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 10Ohmura-Hoshino M. Matsuki Y. Aoki M. Goto E. Mito M. Uematsu M. Kakiuchi T. Hotta H. Ishido S. J.

Immunity. 2006; 25: 885-894Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). In immature dendritic cells, class II is subject to constitutive ubiquitination by MARCH I (12De Gassart A. Camosseto V. Thibodeau J. Ceppi M. Catalan N. Pierre P. Gatti E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2008; 105: 3491-3496Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar), leading to reduced cell surface expression and predominant intracellular accumulation. Upon maturation, ubiquitination is reduced, and class II molecules accumulate at the cell surface. In B cells, MARCH I is also implicated in regulating surface class II expression, again through ubiquitination of the β chain. This suggests that ubiquitination may be a general mechanism for post-translational regulation of class II antigen presentation (13Matsuki Y. Ohmura-Hoshino M. Goto E. Aoki M. Mito-Yoshida M. Uematsu M. Hasegawa T. Koseki H. Ohara O. Nakayama M. Toyooka K. Matsuoka K. Hotta H. Yamamoto A. Ishido S. EMBO J. 2007; 26: 846-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Ubiquitination is a reversible post-translational modification that has varied consequences for the tagged protein. Diverse modifications are possible: single ubiquitin (Ub) molecules may be attached to a single lysine residue, monoubiquitination; or to multiple lysine residues within the same protein, multiubiquitination (14Pickart C.M. Fushman D. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2004; 8: 610-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (835) Google Scholar). Additionally, ubiquitin itself contains seven internal lysine residues that may provide substrates for further Ub attachment, generating functionally distinct polyubiquitin chains (14Pickart C.M. Fushman D. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2004; 8: 610-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (835) Google Scholar). We investigated ubiquitination of the MHC class II molecule HLA-DR and showed that both chains of the heterodimer are modified by polyubiquitination. MARCH I and the related E3 ligase MARCH VIII (c-MIR), preferentially target lysine 225 in the DRβ chain but also ubiquitinate lysine 219 in the DRα tail. The transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains from each chain are sufficient for independent modification by the two MARCH proteins, but the relative levels of ubiquitination are determined by the cytoplasmic tails. Cell Culture and Transfection-Mel JuSo, 293T, and HeLa cells were maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium, 10% fetal calf serum, 10 mm sodium pyruvate, 10 mm nonessential amino acids, 2 mm glutamine, 100 units penicillin, and 100 units of streptomycin. Transfections were performed using Effectene (Qiagen), according to the manufacturer’s recommendations. For stable transfectants, cells were incubated in the presence of the appropriate antibiotic (1 mg/ml Geneticin, 100 μg/ml Zeocin), and positive cells were sorted for either HLA-DR (L243) or CD8 (OKT8) using a MoFlo flow cytometer (Cytomation, Fort Collins, CO). Flow Cytometry-Adherent cells were washed with PBS, harvested using Cell Dissociation Buffer (Sigma), and incubated for 30 min on ice, with anti-CD8 (OKT8), anti-HA (Miltenyi Biotec), anti-HLA-DR (L243), or anti-Ii (Serotec) antibodies, in FACS buffer (5% fetal calf serum, 2 mm EDTA in PBS). After washing, cells were incubated with RPE anti-mouse (Dako Ltd.), fixed in 3% formaldehyde and analyzed using a FACScan™ flow cytometer and Summit software (BD Biosciences). Immunoprecipitation and Western Blot-Anti-HLA-DR (L243) antibody was directly conjugated to cyanogen bromide-activated-Sepharose 4B (Sigma), and anti-DRα antibody TAL1B5 was conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Sigma), according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Cells were harvested using Cell Dissociation Buffer (Sigma) and lysed in lysis buffer (PBS, 1% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 5 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science), and 5 mm iodoacetamide) for 30 min at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitations were performed with Sepharose-coupled anti-HLA-DR (L243) or CD8 (OKT8) preincubated with protein G-Sepharose 4B (Sigma). Lysates were washed extensively and incubated for 5 min at 95 °C in SDS-PAGE loading buffer prior to standard SDS-PAGE and transfer to Hybond™ ECL™ membrane (Amersham Biosciences). Membranes were blocked in PBS, 5% skim milk, 0.1% Tween 20 (Sigma) overnight at 4 °C before probing for MHC class II (HRP-TAL1B5) or ubiquitin (HRP-P4D1; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA). Detection was performed using ECL Plus™ Western blotting detection reagents (ECL plus; Amersham Biosciences). Plasmid Constructs-All PCR was performed with KOD HiFi DNA polymerase according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Calbiochem). Primers used for amplification are summarized in Table 1. The HA-tagged HA-DRB and HA-DRA constructs were generated by PCR amplification from parental DRBw53 (DRB4) and DRA*0101 constructs and cloned into HA-PMX-puro (a gift from Dr. Chiwen Chang, Cambridge, UK). Untagged DR3β chain constructs were amplified from a parental DR1*0303 sequence and cloned into pcDNA3.1/Neo. Untagged DRA constructs were cloned into pcDNA3.1/Zeo. The CD8-DRA and CD8-DRB reporter constructs were generated by overlap PCR amplification and cloned into pcDNA3.1/Neo. Untagged MARCH I was generated by PCR amplification from MARCH I-EGFPc1 and cloned into pcDNA3.1/Neo. All PCR-generated constructs were subject to DNA sequence analysis, to verify authenticity. MARCH I-EGFPc1 and MARCH VIII-EGFPc1 were gifts from Professor Paul Lehner (Cambridge, UK). Additional human MARCH VIII constructs named c-MIRwt and its catalytically inactive variant (c-MIRmt), bearing Cys-Ser mutations in the zinc binding domain, were a gift from Professor Satoshi Ishido (Yokohama, Japan).TABLE 1Summary of primers used for PCR Primers used in construct generation are listed as sense and antisense sequences. Chimeric CD8-DRAB and -DRBA constructs were generated by overlap PCR in a single reaction using standard concentrations of 5′ and 3′ primers and one-tenth the concentration of the internal primers (int). Open table in a new tab Confocal Microscopy-HeLa cells were grown on coverslips, and 24 h after transfection, they were fixed for 10 min with 4% paraformaldehyde. Fixed cells were washed in PBS, permeabilized with 0.1% saponin in PBS, and incubated in PBS containing 0.1% saponin and 5% horse serum with primary antibody: anti-HLA-DR (L243, IgG2a), anti-Ii (anti-CD74; Pharmingen (IgG2a), Serotec (IgG1)), anti-EEA1 (Transduction laboratories (IgG1)), or rabbit polyclonal anti-Lamp-1 (Abcam). Coverslips were washed in PBS containing 0.1% saponin and incubated with appropriate Alexa-conjugated secondary antibodies (Molecular Probes). Coverslips, mounted in Mowiol (Sigma), were viewed under a Zeiss LSM 510 laser-scanning confocal microscope. Images were analyzed using the LSM (Zeiss) and Adobe Photoshop software. Substitution of Lysine 225 in DRβ Does Not Prevent MARCH-induced Down-regulation of HLA-DR-To investigate ubiquitination of MHC class II molecules, we generated HA-tagged DRα and DRβ chain constructs and stably expressed them in Mel JuSo cells. Fig. 1 summarizes the COOH-terminal amino acid composition of the constructs used in this study. Lines expressing similar levels of the tagged molecules were transiently transfected with cDNA vectors encoding the E3 ligases MARCH I, MARCH VIII, c-MIRwt, and c-MIRmt. Expression of HLA-DR was then examined by FACS. As shown in Fig. 2, expression of the active E3 ligases resulted in substantial down-regulation of wild-type HLA-DR, whereas expression of the catalytically inactive c-MIRmt had no effect. Interestingly, cells expressing HA-DRB-K225R showed substantial loss of surface class II, implying that residues in addition to DRB-Lys225 were subject to ubiquitination. This was unexpected, given that previous studies found ubiquitination of MHC class II to be entirely dependent upon a single lysine residue present in the cytoplasmic tail of the β chain (12De Gassart A. Camosseto V. Thibodeau J. Ceppi M. Catalan N. Pierre P. Gatti E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2008; 105: 3491-3496Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Down-regulation was not influenced by the DRβ-encoded COOH-terminal dileucine endocytosis signal or residues carboxyl-terminal of Lys225, since levels of HA-DRB-L235A,L236A and HA-DRB-Δ233 were indistinguishable from those of HA-DRB-K225R. Several explanations could account for our observations. If HLA-DR formed dimers or multimers, association with native DR could enable indirect down-regulation of the HA-tagged molecule. Alternatively, residues in the cytoplasmic tail of DRα could be ubiquitinated, possible targets being two lysine residues located at positions 215 and 219.FIGURE 2MARCH-induced down-regulation of HA-DRB-K225R. Mel JuSo cells, stably expressing various HA-tagged DRα and DRβ constructs, were transiently transfected with MARCH I, MARCH VIII, c-MIRwt, and c-MIRmt, and surface HA expression was assessed by FACS. Dot plots show GFP (FL1) on the x axis and PE-HA (FL2) on the y axis. The R3 gate, which represents cells expressing the E3 ligase, as assessed by GFP expression, was set against IgG control at 0.1%. The IgG control was set using cells expressing GFP (R3), to enable direct comparison between with E3 ligase-expressing transfectants. Data are representative of at least three independent experiments. A, expression of MARCH I, MARCH VIII, and c-MIRwt induced down-regulation of surface HA-DRB, HA-DRB-K225R, HA-DRB-L235A,L236A, and HA-DRB-Δ225. No reduction in surface expression was observed in cells transfected with c-MIRmt. When compared with IgG control antibody staining, MARCH-induced down-regulation of HA-DRB-K225R and HA-DRB-Δ225 was substantial, but less than observed for HA-DRB and HA-DRB-L235A,L236A. B, MARCH I, MARCH VIII, and c-MIRwt induced down-regulation of surface HA-DRA and DRA-K219R. No reduction in surface expression was observed in cells transfected with c-MIRmt. Data are representative of at least three experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Both HLA-DRα and HLA-DRβ Are Subject to Polyubiquitination-To explore down-regulation of DRB-K225R, we performed transient transfections in cells lacking endogenous MHC class II. As shown in Fig. 3, similar levels of surface HLA-DR expression were observed for all combinations of wild-type and mutated DRα and DRβ expressed in 293T cells. Co-expression of MARCH I, or c-MIR, induced down-regulation of all combinations, except for the pair comprising DRA-K219R/DRB-K225R, which remained unaffected. This is most clearly seen by comparison of c-MIRwt and its catalytically inactive counterpart, c-MIRmt. As expected, MARCH VIII behaved the same as c-MIRwt (data not shown). These results show that the down-regulation induced by MARCH I/c-MIR, previously seen with the tagged HA-DRB-K225R construct, was dependent upon lysine 219 of the DRα chain. We noted that the degree of surface down-regulation was greater in the presence of the wild-type β chain and was less when DRA/DRB-K225R were co-expressed, suggesting that ubiquitination of DRα was less efficient than ubiquitination of DRβ. Immunoprecipitation and Western blot analysis of lysates from these transfected cells were used to demonstrate ubiquitination directly. As shown in Fig. 3B, a ladder of bands in the 36–70 kDa size range was observed in lysates from cells transfected with DRA/DRB (lanes 1 and 5). A similar ladder was associated with cells transfected with DRA-K219R/DRB (lanes 3 and 7), suggesting that ubiquitination was predominantly associated with the β chain of the DR dimer. In cells transfected with DRA/DRB-K225R, a weaker ladder of ubiquitinated products was observed, which partially overlapped with that described previously (lanes 2 and 6). Importantly, no ubiquitinated products were observed in cells expressing DRA-K219R/DRB-K225R (lanes 4 and 8). Therefore, down-regulation of surface class II correlated with polyubiquitination of both DRα and DRβ by MARCH I (lanes 1–4) and MARCH VIII (lanes 5–8). These results also show that the additional lysine at position 215 of DRα is not subject to ubiquitination. We were unable to explain previous studies that failed to detect Ub of DRα and questioned if this could be due to the presence of a valine to leucine polymorphism at position 217 in the DRα cytoplasmic tail. However, both alleles of DRα (DRA*0101(valine) and DRA*0102(leucine)) were equally susceptible to MARCH-induced down-regulation (data not shown). We were unable to directly visualize ubiquitinated DRα with the DRα-specific antibody TAL1B5, although unmodified DRα was readily visualized (Fig. 3B, lower panels). This antibody recognizes the cytoplasmic tail of DRα, and although binding does not appear to be influenced by the K219R substitution (Fig. 3B), it is possible that steric hindrance, due to covalent attachment of Ub, could influence the detection of modified products. Alternatively, the proportion of DRα modified may be below the level of detection. The latter explanation is unlikely, since, even after extensive overexposure, there was no hint of a ubiquitinated product. The conclusion of these studies is that lysine residues in both DRα and DRβ are polyubiquitinated by both MARCH I and MARCH VIII but that DRβ is the predominant substrate. We found no evidence of ubiquitination of nonlysine residues on either the α or β chain. Polyubiquitination of DRα and DRβ Is Controlled by Their Transmembrane and Cytoplasmic Tail Domains-To investigate which regions of the HLA-DR molecule were important for recognition by the MARCH proteins, we used CD8 as a reporter molecule (15Goto E. Mito-Yoshida M. Uematsu M. Aoki M. Matsuki Y. Ohmura-Hoshino M. Hotta H. Miyagishi M. Ishido S. PLoS ONE. 2008; 31490Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4, constructs containing the transmembrane and cytoplasmic tails of DRα or DRβ (CD8-DRA and CD8-DRB) showed reduced surface expression in the presence of either E3 ligase, whereas control cells transfected with c-MIRmt (inactive MARCH VIII) were unaffected. Substitution of lysines for arginine confirmed that down-regulation was dependent upon lysines 219 and 225 of the α and β chains, respectively. We repeatedly observed that down-regulation was more pronounced for CD8-DRB compared with CD8-DRA, again implying that the β chain was more efficiently ubiquitinated. This was not due to the presence of the DRβ-encoded dileucine endocytosis signal, since CD8-DRB-L235A,L236A behaved like the wild-type. To explore the differential ubiquitination of DRα and DRβ, we first extended the CD8-DRA construct to incorporate five residues from the stalk region of DRα (CD8-DRAextra), since the corresponding region was present in CD8-DRB (see Fig. 1). Previous studies, using murine and human MHC class I chimeras, suggest that the juxtamembrane region of class I is critical for recognition by MIR2, a herpesvirus-encoded E3 ligase that is related to MARCH I and MARCH VIII (16Coscoy L. Sanchez D.J. Ganem D. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 1265-1273Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). MARCH-induced down-regulation of CD8-DRAextra was slightly more than observed for CD8-DRA but did not reach the levels observed for CD8-DRB (data not shown). The juxtamembrane region of DRα is therefore not required for recognition by MARCH I or MARCH VIII, unlike the viral homologue, MIR2. The Extent of Surface Down-regulation Correlates with the Presence of the DRα and DRβ Cytoplasmic Tails-Domain swaps, where the cytoplasmic tail of DRβ was placed carboxylterminal of the DRα transmembrane region (CD8-DRAB (see Fig. 1)), resulted in more efficient down-regulation by MARCH VIII (Fig. 5A). In a reciprocal exchange, CD8-DRBA behaved like CD8-DRA. Ubiquitination of these reporter molecules was readily visualized after immunoprecipitation and Western blot, and all constructs showed a ladder of bands in the 30–60 kDa range, consistent with polyubiquitination (Fig. 5B). In agreement with their different degree of down-regulation from the cell surface, constructs containing the cytoplasmic tail of DRβ (CD8-DRB and CD8-DRAB) were more extensively ubiquitinated than those bearing the corresponding region of DRα (CD8-DRA and CD8-DRBA). These results show that both DRα and DRβ can be independently recognized by the MARCH I and MARCH VIII E3 ligases and demonstrate that the extent of ubiquitination correlates with the presence of the DRα or DRβ cytoplasmic tails. An explanation of these results is that the extensive ubiquitination of DRβ is due to features associated with the cytoplasmic tail of DRβ that enhance ubiquitination. Alternatively, features associated with the tail of DRα could act to limit its ubiquitination. A Minimal DRβ Cytoplasmic Tail, 222RAAK225, Is a More Efficient Substrate for MARCH I- and MARCH VIII-induced Ubiquitination than the DRα Tail-We investigated the minimal requirements for ubiquitination of DRβ by sequential truncation and alanine substitution of CD8-DRB. Truncation of the entire tail, up to but not including lysine 225 (CD8-DRBΔ226), had no discernable effect on the extent of down-regulation compared with the wild-type (Fig. 6A). Additionally, residues adjacent to lysine 225 (CD8-DRB-222AAAKAAAA229, CD8-DRB-222RAAK225) could be substituted for alanine without loss of regulation by MARCH I or MARCH VIII. Therefore, lysine 225 appeared to be the key single residue in the cytoplasmic tail of DRβ. Other residues could be either removed or substituted with negligible effect (Fig. 6A). The lysine residue could also be substituted for cysteine and still function as a substrate for MARCH I and MARCH VIII (Fig. 6; CD8-DRB-K225C). In contrast to the above, substitutions in the cytoplasmic tail of DRα actually enhanced MARCH-induced surface down-regulation. Fig. 6B compares down-regulation of CD8-DRA and CD8-DRA-215AAAAKAAA222 in the presence of c-MIRwt. Fig. 6B displays FACS profile data as the percentage of the molecules remaining at the cell surface in the presence of c-MIRwt compared with c-MIRmt. In all three independent experiments, the percentage of CD8-DRA-215AAAAKAAA222 remaining at the cell surface was less than for CD8-DRA (Fig. 6B). In summary, a minimal DRβ cytoplasmic tail (222RAAK225) afforded greater down-regulation than the normal DRα tail, 215KGLRKSNAAERRGPL229. Substitution of residues surrounding the ubiquitinated lysine in DRα enhanced its down-regulation. This suggests that sequences in the DRα tail act to limit the extent of down-regulation and, by implication, ubiquitination. Intracellular HLA-DR Co-localizes with MARCH I in Late Endocytic Compartments-To investigate if localization of MARCH proteins and class II correlated with ubiquitination, intracellular distribution was investigated by confocal microscopy. As shown in Fig. 7 (A–D), MARCH I localized predominantly to EEA1-positive early endosomes and Lamp1-positive late endosomal compartments and was also present at the cell surface, as has previously been reported (12De Gassart A. Camosseto V. Thibodeau J. Ceppi M. Catalan N. Pierre P. Gatti E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2008; 105: 3491-3496Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Intracellular class II was not associated with early endosomes (Fig. 7, A and B) but localized to Lamp1-positive late endosomal compartments, some of which were also positive for MARCH I (Fig. 7, C and D). This distribution of class II was not influenced by lysine to arginine substitutions in the various DR constructs (Fig. 7, compare A and C with B and D). All construct combinations showed a comparable intracellular distribution. Similar results were also obtained for localization of class II and MARCH VIII (data not shown). The localization of class II and MARCH I, in Lamp1-positive compartments, did not correlate with the extent of ubiquitination, since both DRA/DRB and DRA-K219R/DRB-K225R showed a similar degree of colocalization with the MARCH proteins, but the latter is not ubiquitinated. We also investigated how the distribution of class II was influenced by the presence of Ii. As shown in Fig. 7, G panels, Ii localized to EEA1-positive early endosomes, some of which co-localized with MARCH I. Ii was not present in Lamp1-positive late endosomes (data not shown). Mature DRA/DRB and DRA-K219R/DRB-K225R was not present in EEA1-positive early endosomes (Fig. 7, E and F panels). The majority of mature class II did not colocalize with Ii. This is consistent with a need for Ii chain removal for binding of L243, a process that occurs upon trafficking to late endosomal compartments. From this we conclude that, in the presence or absence of Ii, the majority of intracellular class II is in Lamp1-positive late endosomal compartments. This distribution appears independent of ubiquitination, since we observe a similar localization for all DR constructs irrespective of their ability to be ubiquitinated. Ubiquitination of Class II Occurs in Both the Presence and Absence of Ii-To investigate if association with Ii influenced the pattern of ubiquitination of class II, we performed transient transfections in the presence of Ii. As shown in Fig. 8A, co-transfection of DRA/DRB and Ii resulted in expression of both Ii- and L243-reactive HLA-DR at the cell surface, as expected. The presence of MARCH I or MARCH VIII led to a large reduction in surface expression of wild-type DR (Fig. 8B). Cells transfected with Ii/DRA-K219R/DRB showed a similar reduction. Cells transfected with Ii/DRA/DRB-K225R showed a less marked reduction in surface expression, as we have previously observed in the absence of Ii. In cells transfected with Ii/DRA-K219R/DRB-K225R, surface class II remained high in the presence of either MARCH I or MARCH VIII. We investigated ubiquitination of class II in these transfectants and observed that the pattern of polyubiquitinated products was similar to that observed in the absence of Ii (Figs. 3B and 8C). Therefore, although the overall level of class II increased in the presence of Ii, consistent with its role as a class II chaperone, the pattern of ubiquitination remained unchanged. Regulation of MHC class II antigen presentation is a complex, tightly controlled process. Transcriptionally, it is achieved through a master regulator, CIITA; however, post-transcriptional regulation is also important. In murine dendritic cells, for example, surface localization is controlled through ubiquitination of a single lysine residue present in the cytoplasmic tail of IA-β (9Shin J.S. Ebersold M. Pypaert M. Delamarre L. Hartley A. Mellman I. Nature. 2006; 444: 115-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 11van Niel G. Wubbolts R. Ten Broeke T. Buschow S.I. Ossendorp F.A. Melief C.J. Raposo G. van Balkom B.W. Stoorvogel W. Immunity. 2006; 25: 885-894Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). The E3 ligase responsible for the maturation-dependent stabilization of HLA-DR, in human dendritic cells, has been identified as a member of the MARCH family of E3 ligases (12De Gassart A. Camosseto V. Thibodeau J. Ceppi M. Catalan N. Pierre P. Gatti E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2008; 105: 3491-3496Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Here we show that, unlike the murine IA molecule, HLA-DR is subject to MARCH-induced polyubiquitination on both the α and β chains. Ubiquitination of the α chain alone is sufficient for efficient MARCH I- and MARCH VIII-induced down-regulation of HLA-DR from the cell surface. The β chain-encoded lysine is conserved in HLA-DP, -DQ, and -DR and is also conserved across species, between humans and mice. In contrast, the α chain lysine is not present in HLA-DP, -DQ, or IA but is conserved across species, between DRα and IE-α, implying that it may have an isotype-specific function. Although polyubiquitination is mainly associated with proteasomal degradation, it also functions as an endocytosis signal. Ubiquitination can control internalization, either directly from the cell surface, or at later stages of the endocytic pathway (17Katzmann D.J. Odorizzi G. Emr S.D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 893-905Crossref PubMed Scopus (1021) Google Scholar). We removed the dileucine motif from HLA-DRβ and observed that MARCH driven down-regulation of HA-DRB and HA-DRB-L235A,L236A was indistinguishable. Therefore, down-regulation was not dependent upon prior internalization driven by the dileucine endocytosis signal (18Zhong G. Romagnoli P. Germain R.N. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 429-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). This is consistent with localization of MARCH I to the plasma membrane (Fig. 7) and implicates this as a possible location where ubiquitination occurs (12De Gassart A. Camosseto V. Thibodeau J. Ceppi M. Catalan N. Pierre P. Gatti E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2008; 105: 3491-3496Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Both MARCH I and MARCH VIII localized, as expected, to both early and late endosomes, together with expression at the cell surface (12De Gassart A. Camosseto V. Thibodeau J. Ceppi M. Catalan N. Pierre P. Gatti E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2008; 105: 3491-3496Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). In both the presence and absence of Ii, class II co-localized with MARCH I in Lamp1-positive compartments and at the cell surface, implicating these locations as possible sites of ubiquitination. Intracellular colocalization with MARCH I did not appear to be influenced by ubiquitination, since wild-type DR and DRA-K219R/DRB-K225R remained predominantly in Lamp1-positive compartments and showed a similar degree of colocalization with MARCH I. Ub contains seven internal lysine residues that can themselves be attached to additional Ub monomers to generate Ub chains. The nature of the polyubiquitin linkage is important. UbLys-48 polyubiquitination is mainly associated with proteasomal degradation, and UbLys-63 polyubiquitination is linked to numerous functions, including cell surface internalization and late endosomal/lysosomal targeting (19Nakatsu F. Sakuma M. Matsuo Y. Arase H. Yamasaki S. Nakamura N. Saito T. Ohno H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26213-26219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 20Galan J.M. Haguenauer-Tsapis R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5847-5854Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). We attempted to determine the nature of the linkage using UbK48R and UbK63R expression constructs, as has been shown for MHC class I (21Duncan L.M. Piper S. Dodd R.B. Saville M.K. Sanderson C.M. Luzio J.P. Lehner P.J. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 1635-1645Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Analogous to that study, we generated stable MARCH I transfectants in Mel JuSo cells that expressed reduced levels of surface MHC class II. We were unable to rescue surface class II expression through expression of UbK48R and UbK63R, probably due to insufficient levels of expression of the mutant Ub constructs (data not shown). Receptor Ub may determine the internalization pathway used (22Mukherjee K. Siddiqi S.A. Hashim S. Raje M. Basu S.K. Mukhopadhyay A. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 741-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), since it may allow UbLys-63-tagged receptors access to the interior of the multivesicular body (23Komada M. Kitamura N. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2005; 137: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Given the importance of localization of MHC class II molecules to antigen-processing compartments, it will be of interest to confirm the nature of the Ub linkage on DRα and DRβ and its role in MVB localization. We are attempting to do this using a lentivirus expression system. Ubiquitin chains are proposed to contain only one type of linkage (24Peng J. Schwartz D. Elias J.E. Thoreen C.C. Cheng D. Marsischky G. Roelofs J. Finley D. Gygi S.P. Nat. Biotechnol. 2003; 21: 921-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (1311) Google Scholar). Ubiquitination of DRα would allow the DR heterodimer to be modified by distinct linkage types affording differential regulation. We investigated ubiquitination of the individual HLA-DR α and β chains by the MARCH proteins using CD8 as a reporter molecule. Constructs comprising the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains of DRα and DRβ were independently recognized by both E3 ligases, and down-regulation was lysine-dependent. However, similar to the situation with the DR dimer, CD8-DRB was more extensively ubiquitinated than CD8-DRA. This difference correlated with the cytoplasmic tail domains. When expressed with the DRα transmembrane domain, the DRβ tail was extensively ubiquitinated, and when expressed with the DRβ transmembrane domain, the DRα tail was less extensively ubiquitinated. We considered whether this disparity was due to the DRβ tail facilitating ubiquitination or the DRα tail antagonizing ubiquitination. Since sequential truncations, up to lysine 225, and substitution of adjacent residues for alanine had a minimal effect on MARCH-induced down-regulation of CD8-DRB, we concluded that sequence elements in the DRβ tail were unlikely to facilitate ubiquitination. Although lysine 225 is clearly required, it may not be part of a recognition motif (25Ciechanover A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7151-7160Crossref PubMed Scopus (1196) Google Scholar). Consistent with the view that features associated with the DRα tail led to reduced Ub, we found that substitution of the tail of DRα for a synthetic tail 215AAAAKAAA222 actually enhanced surface down-regulation in a CD8-DRA reporter assay. It is clear that ubiquitination can occur on lysine residues present in synthetic tails, implying that the sequence context of the lysine is of minor importance. However, even short tails can contain important additional information, as is seen with the 7-amino acid peptide of carboxypeptidase, which, when attached to the cytoplasmic tail of a reporter molecule, allowed sorting of a then ubiquitinated protein into multivesicular body vesicles (17Katzmann D.J. Odorizzi G. Emr S.D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 893-905Crossref PubMed Scopus (1021) Google Scholar, 26Katzmann D.J. Babst M. Emr S.D. Cell. 2001; 106: 145-155Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1130) Google Scholar). It will be of interest to identify which elements in the DRα tail are involved in regulating ubiquitination and how this is achieved. The consequence of ubiquitination of DRα also remains to be determined; in particular, it will be important to determine if it confers isotype-specific regulation of HLA-DR compared with HLA-DP and -DQ.

https://openalex.org/W2124267724,"Background Translocation of the facilitative glucose transporter GLUT4 from an intracellular store to the plasma membrane is responsible for the increased rate of glucose transport into fat and muscle cells in response to insulin. This represents a specialised form of regulated membrane trafficking. Intracellular membrane traffic is subject to multiple levels of regulation by conserved families of proteins in all eukaryotic cells. Notably, all intracellular fusion events require SNARE proteins and Sec1p/Munc18 family members. Fusion of GLUT4-containing vesicles with the plasma membrane of insulin-sensitive cells involves the SM protein Munc18c, and is regulated by the formation of syntaxin 4/SNAP23/VAMP2 SNARE complexes. Methodology/Principal Findings Here we have used biochemical approaches to characterise the interaction(s) of Munc18c with its cognate SNARE proteins and to examine the role of Munc18c in regulating liposome fusion catalysed by syntaxin 4/SNAP23/VAMP2 SNARE complex formation. We demonstrate that Munc18c makes contacts with both t- and v-SNARE proteins of this complex, and directly inhibits bilayer fusion mediated by the syntaxin 4/SNAP23/VAMP2 SNARE complex. Conclusion/Significance Our reductionist approach has enabled us to ascertain a direct inhibitory role for Munc18c in regulating membrane fusion mediated by syntaxin 4/SNAP23/VAMP2 SNARE complex formation. It is important to note that two different SM proteins have recently been shown to stimulate liposome fusion mediated by their cognate SNARE complexes. Given the structural similarities between SM proteins, it seems unlikely that different members of this family perform opposing regulatory functions. Hence, our findings indicate that Munc18c requires a further level of regulation in order to stimulate SNARE-mediated membrane fusion."
https://openalex.org/W2055883006,"Foxp3 is a 47-kDa transcription factor central to regulatory T cell (Treg) function. The importance of Foxp3(+) Tregs in controlling self-reactive T cells and preventing autoimmunity is well established. Our analysis of Foxp3 expression in natural Tregs led to identification of a shorter 41-kDa Foxp3 species in activated Tregs, indicating that Foxp3 may be processed by proteolytic cleavage upon cell activation. Searches of murine and human Foxp3 sequences for potential cleavage sites responsible for the generation of the short Foxp3 species revealed the presence of two RXXR proprotein convertase (PC) motifs, (48)RDLR(51) and (414)RKKR(417), located near the N- and C-terminal ends, respectively. We show, using retroviral expression of Foxp3 in CD4(+) T cells, that Foxp3 is cleaved at both the N- and C-terminal RXXR sites and that mutagenesis of the RXXR motif prevents cleavage. The cleaved forms of Foxp3 are found in the chromatin fraction but not in nuclear or cytoplasmic extracts. CD4(+) T cells expressing Foxp3 species engineered to mimic N-terminally, C-terminally, or N- and C-terminally cleaved Foxp3 forms are functionally distinct, as indicated by differences in expression of key Treg genes, such as interleukin-10 and cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA-4). In addition, CD4(+) cells expressing C-cleaved Foxp3 are superior to those that express WT Foxp3 in preventing experimental colitis. Coexpression of Foxp3 with PC1 or PC7 results in cleavage of the Foxp3 C terminus. The mechanism by which Foxp3 is processed likely extends to other members of the FoxP subfamily, because Foxp1 and Foxp2 also have N-terminal RXXR proteolytic cleavage motifs at similar locations to Foxp3. Our results indicate that the generation of fully functionally competent Tregs is complex and dependent on the generation of multiple forms of Foxp3 that have differing effects on Treg cytokine production and suppressive function."
https://openalex.org/W2078897661,"Zinc is an essential cofactor required for the function of approximately 8% of the yeast and 10% of the human proteome. All of the ""small Tim"" proteins of the mitochondrial intermembrane space contain a strictly conserved ""twin CX(3)C"" zinc finger motif, which can bind zinc ions in the Cys-reduced form. We have shown previously that although disulfide bond formation is essential for the function of these proteins in mitochondria, only reduced proteins can be imported into mitochondria (Lu, H., Allen, S., Wardleworth, L., Savory, P., and Tokatlidis, K. (2004) J. Biol. Chem. 279, 18952-18958 and Morgan, B., and Lu, H. (2008) Biochem. J. 411, 115-122). However, the role of zinc during the import of these proteins is unclear. This study shows that the function of zinc is complex. It can play a thiol stabilizer role preventing oxidative folding of the small Tim proteins and maintaining the proteins in an import-competent form. On the other hand, zinc-bound forms cannot be imported into mitochondria efficiently. Furthermore, our results show that zinc is a powerful inhibitor of Erv1, an essential component of the import pathway used by the small Tim proteins. We propose that zinc plays a chaperone-like role in the cytosol during biogenesis of the small Tim proteins and that the proteins are imported into mitochondria through the apo-forms."

https://openalex.org/W2007029240,"Release of endothelial cells from contact-inhibition and cell cycle re-entry is required for the induction of new blood vessel formation by angiogenesis. Using a combination of chemical inhibition, loss of function, and gain of function approaches, we demonstrate that endothelial cell cycle re-entry, S phase progression, and subsequent angiogenic tubule formation are dependent upon the activity of cytosolic phospholipase A2-α (cPLA2α). Inhibition of cPLA2α activity and small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated knockdown of endogenous cPLA2α reduced endothelial cell proliferation. In the absence of cPLA2α activity, endothelial cells exhibited retarded progression from G1 through S phase, displayed reduced cyclin A/cdk2 expression, and generated less arachidonic acid. In quiescent endothelial cells, cPLA2α is inactivated upon its sequestration at the Golgi apparatus. Upon the stimulation of endothelial cell proliferation, activation of cPLA2α by release from the Golgi apparatus was critical to the induction of cyclin A expression and efficient cell cycle progression. Consequently, inhibition of cPLA2α was sufficient to block angiogenic tubule formation in vitro. Furthermore, the siRNA-mediated retardation of endothelial cell cycle re-entry and proliferation was reversed upon overexpression of an siRNA-resistant form of cPLA2α.

The vascular endothelium consists of a monolayer of endothelial cells that lines the luminal surface of all blood vessels in vivo. The endothelium actively participates in a variety of key vascular processes such as the regulation of vascular tone and blood fluidity. In addition, the endothelium regulates the formation of new blood vessels by the process of angiogenesis in development, tissue repair, and tumor vascularization (1Carmeliet P. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 389-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (3494) Google Scholar, 2Carmeliet P. Nature. 2005; 438: 932-936Crossref PubMed Scopus (2840) Google Scholar). The mature endothelium consists of contact-inhibited confluent monolayers of cells that reside in the G0 phase of quiescence. Upon loss of cell-cell contacts, endothelial cells re-enter the cell cycle and proliferate. This entry of endothelial cells into the cell cycle from G0 is a critical component of the angiogenic response and the formation of new capillaries from pre-existing blood vessels (1Carmeliet P. Nat.

Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 1-2Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (758) Google Scholar). The PLA2 family represents a diverse family of enzymes that can be divided into three main groups as follows: the group IV cytosolic PLA2 (cPLA2), the group VI Ca2+-independent PLA2 (iPLA2), and the secretory PLA2 enzymes (4Akiba S. Sato T. Biol. Pharm. Bull. 2004; 27: 1174-1178Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The cPLA2 group of enzymes consists of at least six members (cPLA2α,-β,-γ,-δ, -∊, and -ζ), of which cPLA2α is the most extensively characterized. cPLA2α is Ca2+-sensitive and translocates to intracellular membranes upon agonist stimulation and cytosolic Ca2+ elevation utilizing an N terminal Ca2+-dependent lipid binding (C2) domain (5Nalefski E.A.

FEBS Lett. 1997; 410: 49-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Proliferating, nonconfluent endothelial cells release much greater levels of arachidonic acid and prostaglandin than quiescent confluent cells (9Evans C.E. Billington D. McEvoy F.A.

In quiescent confluent cells, cPLA2α is inactivated upon sequestration at the Golgi apparatus and is subsequently released and activated in proliferating cells (11Herbert S.P. Ponnambalam S.

Despite this, the actual function of this differential regulation of cPLA2α activity has not been defined. Here we identify a novel role for cPLA2α activation in the regulation of endothelial cell cycle progression. Upon the loss of cell-cell contacts and the induction of endothelial cell proliferation, activation of cPLA2α is required for the induction of cyclin A expression and efficient progression through G1 and S phases. Our work and work by others have previously shown that the activity of iPLA2 also influences the progression of endothelial cells through S phase (13Zhang X.H. Zhao C. Ma Z.A. J.

All cells were grown on 0.1% (w/v) gelatin-coated culture-ware and were not used in excess of four passages. The following antibodies were purchased: anti-αII-spectrin (C3; sc-48382) and anti-cPLA2α (C20; Santa Cruz Biotechnology); anti-PCNA (610664), anti-cyclin A (611268), and anti-cdk2 (610145; BD Transduction Laboratories); anti-caspase-3, anti-caspase-7, anti-caspase-9, and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (Cell Signaling Technologies); horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Pierce); and Alexafluor-conjugated secondary antibodies (Molecular Probes). Anti-GRASP55 antibodies were provided by F. Barr (University of Liverpool, UK). Arachidonyl trifluoromethyl ketone (AACOCF3) was purchased from Biomol. Pyrrolidine, AZ-1/compound 22, and Wyeth-1 were kind gifts from M. H.

The original cPLA2α construct was obtained from M. Gelb as a GFP fusion protein. Two point mutations were introduced into the siRNA-1-binding site on cPLA2α (centered around nucleotide 774) using QuickChange III site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) and designated 774 cPLA2α. The mutant sequence was subcloned into pIRES-GFP vector and assessed by DNA sequencing, and siRNA resistance was confirmed by co-expression in HEK293 cells. All other reagents were obtained from Sigma or Invitrogen unless otherwise stated. AA Release Assay—This assay was performed as described previously (11Herbert S.P. Ponnambalam S. Walker J.H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 3800-3809Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Briefly, HUVECs were cultured to the required density in either 6-well or 60-mm2 dishes and labeled for 24 h with 0.5 μCi/ml [3H]AA in growth media. Subconfluent, confluent, or wounded cells were washed with PBS and incubated with cPLA2α inhibitors for 15 min or overnight as indicated. For measurement of passive AA release, media were collected following overnight incubation (18 h), cleared by centrifugation, and assayed for radioactivity by liquid scintillation counting. For ionophore-stimulated release, cells were incubated with 5 μm A23187 in HEPES/Tyrode Buffer (X) containing 2 mm CaCl2, supplemented with 0.3% (w/v) fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin for 15 min. Cleared supernatant containing released AA was assayed for radioactivity by liquid scintillation as were total cell lysates prepared by lysis of cells in 0.5% Triton X-100. AA release under each condition was expressed as a percentage of total cellular radioactivities. Proliferation ELISA—HUVEC proliferation rates were assessed using a 5-bromo-2′-deoxyuridine (BrdUrd) incorporation-based ELISA (Roche Diagnostics). Cells were seeded at 1 × 103 cells per well (0.55 × 103 cells/cm2) in 96-well plates, grown for 24 h, incubated for 16 h with inhibitors and BrdUrd, and then processed according to manufacturer's instructions. Proliferation was also determined after 48 h of growth by assessing viable cell numbers using the MTS-based CellTiter® AQueous nonradioactive cell proliferation assay (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Microscopy and Quantification—Phase contrast images were acquired using an Olympus CK2 inverted microscope (10× lens) linked to an Olympus OM-1 camera. Deconvolution fluorescence microscopy was performed using an Olympus IX-70 inverted fluorescence microscope (63 × 1.5 oil immersion lens) and DeltaVision deconvolution system (Applied Precision Inc.). Individual optical sections of 0.2 μm were generated from 15 iterative cycles of deconvolution. Some images were collected using a Zeiss LSM510 META Axiovert 200 M confocal microscope. Multiple comparisons were performed using oneway analysis of variance and Tukey's post-test analysis with GraphPad Prism software. Flow Cytometry—Subconfluent HUVECs were cultured for 16 h in the presence or absence of inhibitor. Cells were then harvested, fixed in 70% ice-cold ethanol, and incubated with propidium iodide (50 μg/ml) and RNase A (20 μg/ml) for 3 h. DNA content was then assessed using a FACSCalibur flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) and the percentage of cells in each phase of the cell cycle analyzed using Modfit software (Verity Software House). For some experiments G0-synchronized confluent HUVECs, serum-starved overnight, were seeded at subconfluent density in the presence or absence of inhibitors for 14 h. Cells were then either chased in fresh media containing inhibitors for various time points prior to processing as above, or siRNA-treated cells were pulsed with media supplemented with 10 μm BrdUrd for 30 min prior to harvesting, fixation, and analysis for BrdUrd incorporation. Biochemistry—Lysate preparation and Western analysis were performed as described previously (11Herbert S.P. Ponnambalam S. Walker J.H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 3800-3809Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitations were performed overnight at 4 °C using protein G-Sepharose (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.), 3 μg of antibody, and 500 μg of total protein in 1% Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (50 mm Tris/HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm EGTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, pH 7.4). Samples (20 μg of protein or total bead volume) were resolved for 60 min at 30 mA/gel on 10% SDS-PAGE mini-gels using a discontinuous buffer system (18Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). For immunoblotting, protein was transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes for 3 h at 300 mA (19Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44939) Google Scholar). Membranes were blocked in 5% (w/v) nonfat milk in PBS for 30 min and then incubated overnight with primary antibody (1:500) at room temperature. After incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-goat IgG (1:3000) for 1 h, immunoreactive bands were visualized using a West Pico enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) detection kit (Pierce). Images were captured on a Fuji Film Intelligent dark box II image reader. Band intensities were determined densitometrically using Aida (Advanced Image Data Analyzer) 2.11 software. RNA Interference—HUVECs were transfected with either no siRNA (control), 10-50 nm nontargeting control siRNA (mock; D-001210-01; Dharmacon), or 10-50 nm annealed cPLA2α siRNA (siRNA-1, 30774; or siRNA-2, 30953; Ambion) for 4 h using either Lipofectamine 2000 or RNAiMAX transfection reagent (Invitrogen). siRNA against iPLA2-VIA has been described previously (15Herbert S.P. Walker J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 35709-35716Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Cells were recovered for 48 h prior to lysis. For cPLA2α supplementation experiments, cells were transfected with siRNA-1 or scrambled sequence using RNAiMAX for 24 h before harvesting and transfection with mutant 774 cPLA2 by electroporation as described previously (12Herbert S.P. Odell A.F. Ponnambalam S. Walker J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 34468-34478Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Cells were plated onto coverslips, recovered for 24 h, and processed for cyclin A, Ki67, and GFP expression analysis by immunofluorescence microscopy. Immunofluorescence Microscopy—Immunofluorescence was performed as described previously (11Herbert S.P. Ponnambalam S. Walker J.H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 3800-3809Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells grown on coverslips were fixed in 10% (v/v) formalin in neutral buffered saline (HT50-1-128; Sigma) for 5 min at 37 °C. After permeabilization with 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100 for 5 min, cells were refixed (5 min), washed with PBS, and then incubated in 50 mm ammonium chloride for 10 min. Following PBS washes, nonspecific binding sites were blocked with 5% (v/v) donkey serum for 3 h. Cells were incubated overnight with primary antibody followed by the appropriate secondary antibodies. Finally, coverslips were mounted on microscope slides in Fluoromount-G mounting medium (Southern Biotech). For analysis of BrdUrd incorporation, cells were fixed in ice-cold 80% ethanol for 20 min followed by a 20-min fixative step in 100% ethanol on ice. Cells were then incubated with 2 n HCl, 0.5% Triton X-100 for 20 min at room temperature followed by a wash in 100 mm sodium tetraborohydrate. Cells were then processed as above with the indicated antibodies. Differentiation and Migration Assays—To assess HUVEC differentiation, 1 × 105 cells were seeded in 24-well dishes coated with 100 μl of Matrigel (BD Biosciences). Cells were incubated in the presence or absence of inhibitor for 16 h prior to imaging. Tubule length was quantified using ImageJ software (rsb.info.nih). For migration assays, HUVECs (5 × 104 cells) were seeded in serum-free media to the top chamber of 24-well modified Boyden chambers (3 μm pores; Transwell-Costar Corp.). Cells were allowed to migrate toward serum-containing media for 16 h in the presence of absence of inhibitor. Migrated cells were fixed, stained with DAPI, and then counted. Angiogenesis Assay—Co-cultures of HUVECs seeded on a bed of human fibroblasts (TCS Cellworks) were cultured for 7 days in the presence or absence of inhibitor. Tubules were fixed, stained, and imaged by phase contrast microscopy. Tubule length was quantified using ImageJ software. cPLA2α Mediates Endothelial Cell Proliferation—We have previously demonstrated a requirement for both iPLA2- and cPLA2α-mediated AA release in the regulation of HUVEC proliferation (11Herbert S.P. Ponnambalam S. Walker J.H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 3800-3809Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 15Herbert S.P. Walker J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 35709-35716Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). We sought to further examine the contribution of cPLA2α to endothelial cell proliferation by measuring BrdUrd incorporation into DNA in the presence of concentrations of inhibitors that maximally block cPLA2α activity. To initially define concentrations of inhibitors that maximally inhibited cPLA2α activity, passive AA release generated by proliferating HUVECs was quantified following 18 h of incubation with varying concentrations of the cPLA2α-specific inhibitors pyrrolidine and Wyeth-1 (Wy-1) (20Ghomashchi F. Stewart A. Hefner Y. Ramanadham S. Turk J. Leslie C.C. Gelb M.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1513: 160-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 21Ni Z. Okeley N.M. Smart B.P. Gelb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 16245-16255Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) or the cPLA2α/iPLA2 inhibitor AACOCF3 (22Ackermann E.J. Conde-Frieboes K. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 445-450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). Maximal inhibition of cPLA2α-mediated AA release was achieved with between 2.5 and 5 μm pyrrolidine and 2.5 and 5 μm Wy-1 with no further increase in inhibition observed at higher concentrations (Fig. 1A). AACOCF3 also maximally inhibited AA release at 2.5 μm, although the extent of this inhibition was much greater than with pyrrolidine or Wy-1 alone, consistent with the combined inhibition of both cPLA2α- and iPLA2 activities, which contribute to the pool of released AA by proliferating endothelial cells. The modest reduction in long term AA release following cPLA2α inhibition may reflect both the assay conditions, where radiolabeled AA may be produced by non-cPLA2α-dependent mechanisms that cannot be controlled for (such as normal membrane turnover) and the contribution of the cPLA2α-generated pool to this process. However, ionophore treatment selectively liberates AA derived from pools accessible to the Ca2+-dependent isoforms of PLA2 and can thus be considered selective for the activation of cPLA2α in HUVECs. Under these conditions, similar to the overnight release assay, short term (15 min) preincubation with 2.5 μm pyrrolidine or Wy-1 was also sufficient to maximally inhibit Ca2+-induced AA release induced by the ionophore A23187 (Fig. 1B). AACOCF3 appeared less effective at reducing stimulated AA release, and the varying extent of the inhibition by the various drugs may reflect the differing initial bioavailabilities of these structurally distinct compounds. A role for cPLA2α in the regulation of endothelial cell proliferation was then confirmed upon incubation of HUVECs with 2.5 μm pyrrolidine or Wy-1 (Fig. 1, C and D). Maximal inhibition of cPLA2α activity was sufficient to significantly retard HUVEC proliferation. Furthermore, incubation with 2.5 μm pyrrolidine also significantly inhibited HDMEC proliferation (Fig. 1E) suggesting that a role for cPLA2α in the regulation of cellular proliferation is common to other endothelial cell types. The anti-proliferative effect of cPLA2α inhibition could not be attributed to increased cell death as the concentration of inhibitors used did not affect cell viability (as assessed by trypan blue exclusion and annexin V binding) or caspase-3 activation and did not promote the cleavage of αII-spectrin or poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (data not shown). However, varying levels of inhibitor cytotoxicity were observed at doses exceeding those used in this study (data not shown). Specific analysis of the vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A) pathway showed that cPLA2α activity is required for the induction of cellular proliferation by this important angiogenic stimulus. Indeed, VEGF-A-mediated cell turnover was reduced by 40-50% in the presence of the various cPLA2α inhibitors as determined by MTS-based assay of relative cell number after 48 h of growth (Fig. 1F). Furthermore, incubation with 5 μm AACOCF3 and the combined inhibition of cPLA2α and iPLA2 reduced HUVEC proliferation to levels similar to those found in the absence of growth factor and serum, suggesting that cPLA2α and iPLA2 may function cooperatively during VEGF-induced endothelial cell proliferation. cPLA2α-mediated Proliferation Is Essential for Angiogenesis—Angiogenic tubule formation is a multistep process involving the proliferation, migration, and differentiation of endothelial cells (1Carmeliet P. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 389-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (3494) Google Scholar, 2Carmeliet P. Nature. 2005; 438: 932-936Crossref PubMed Scopus (2840) Google Scholar). Consequently, conversion of endothelial cells from quiescence to a proliferative state is vital to angiogenesis (1Carmeliet P. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 389-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (3494) Google Scholar). As cPLA2α activity is required for endothelial cell proliferation (Fig. 1), we hypothesized that cPLA2α activity plays a key role in angiogenesis. Endothelial cell tubule formation can be assessed using co-culture assays in vitro. In this assay, HUVECs were seeded on a bed of human dermal fibroblasts and cultured for 7 days. Under these conditions endothelial cells form tubules with patent lumens, reminiscent of mature capillaries (23Staton C.A. Stribbling S.M. Tazzyman S. Hughes R. Brown N.J. Lewis C.F. Int. J. Exp. Pathol. 2004; 85: 233-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). Tubule formation in this assay involves the combined proliferation, migration, and differentiation of endothelial cells. Incubation with pyrrolidine reduced tubule length to 32.8 ± 4.8% of controls (Fig. 2A). Wy-1 also showed a similar ability to reduce tubule formation (Fig. 2A). Thus cPLA2α activity regulates the formation of new blood capillaries by angiogenesis in in vitro assays. To further examine the importance of cPLA2α activity for endothelial cell proliferation during angiogenesis and the long term effects of pyrrolidine on cell viability, endothelial cell numbers were determined by counting over 7 days of culture (Fig. 2B). HUVECs seeded at a density of 3000 cells/cm2 were given 24 h to settle and then were cultured for 7 days in the presence or absence of 2.5 μm pyrrolidine. At 24-h intervals, cells were harvested and counted (Fig. 2B). Control cell numbers increased as a function of time, whereas cells grown in the presence of pyrrolidine remained at a constant density. Inhibition of growth was not because of cell death as incubation with pyrrolidine for 7 days did not affect cell viability, and endothelial cell morphology was unaffected by cPLA2α inhibition (data not shown). Furthermore, this block in cell proliferation was entirely reversible as cells grown in the presence of pyrrolidine for 5 days recovered upon washout of inhibitor, with a 24-fold increase in cell density after 8 days of recovery (Fig. 2C). Similarly, culture in the presence of pyrrolidine also significantly blocks HDMEC growth (Fig. 2D). Thus, long term inhibition of cPLA2α had a profound effect on cell growth and the ability of endothelial cells to form angiogenic tubules. We also assessed the role cPLA2α in endothelial cell migration, and differentiation. HUVEC migration, as assayed using Boyden chambers (23Staton C.A. Stribbling S.M. Tazzyman S. Hughes R. Brown N.J. Lewis C.F. Int. J. Exp. Pathol. 2004; 85: 233-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar), was not affected by incubation with pyrrolidine (Fig. 2E). In addition, pyrrolidine did not inhibit endothelial cell migration or differentiation, as studied using Matrigel assays (Fig. 2F). Here a fixed number of cells were grown on an appropriate substratum for 24 h. Sufficient cells are present to allow migration and differentiation into tubules even in the absence of cell proliferation (23Staton C.A. Stribbling S.M. Tazzyman S. Hughes R. Brown N.J. Lewis C.F. Int. J. Exp. Pathol. 2004; 85: 233-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). In this assay, HUVEC tubule formation, branching number, and branch length were not affected by inhibition of cPLA2α with either pyrrolidine or Wy-1 (Fig. 2F). As cPLA2α does not play a role in HUVEC migration or differentiation (Fig. 2, E and F), inhibition of endothelial cell proliferation caused by blocking cPLA2α activity (Fig. 1, C and F) must be sufficient to block angiogenic tubule formation in co-culture assays (Fig. 2A). The role of cPLA2 in mediating this proliferation defect was examined in further detail below. cPLA2α Modulates Endothelial Cell S Phase Progression and Cell Cycle Residence—The role of cPLA2α in the regulation of cell cycle progression was assessed by analyzing the cell cycle distribution of endothelial cells using flow cytometry. Proliferating endothelial cells were cultured in the presence or absence of 2.5 μm pyrrolidine for 16 h. Cells were then stained with propidium iodide, and cellular DNA content was analyzed by FACS. As determined by fluorescence-activated cell sorter, the number of cells in S phase was markedly reduced upon cPLA2α inhibition (Fig. 3, A and B). As a result, significantly more cells resided in the G0-G1 phases of the cell cycle, suggesting that cPLA2α modulates G1 to S phase progression. To examine the rate of progression of HUVECs through the cell cycle upon cPLA2α inhibition, serum-starved, quiescent confluent cells (G0 synchronized) were trypsinized, re-seeded to subconfluent density, and allowed to re-enter the cell cycle for 14 h (optimized for maximal cell cycle re-entry, data not shown) in the presence or absence of pyrrolidine (2.5 μm). Cells were then incubated in fresh media with or without pyrrolidine for various time points (0, 3, 6, 9 h), harvested at the indicated times, ethanol-fixed, stained with propidium iodide, and analyzed by flow cytometry. As shown in Fig. 3C, treatment of cells with pyrrolidine resulted in a significant increase (∼10%) in the number of cells in G0-G1 phase, despite a time-dependent reduction in the total number of cells in G0-G1. Importantly, the distribution of cells in S phase was also altered upon cPLA2α inhibition over the 9-h chase period (Fig. 3C). Pyrrolidine-treated cells displayed both reduced numbers of cells in S phase (∼5% reduction in total cell number) and a delay in reaching S phase peak (∼6 h pos"
https://openalex.org/W2058115503,"The LIM-only adaptor PINCH (the particularly interesting cysteine- and histidine-rich protein) plays a pivotal role in the assembly of focal adhesions (FAs), supramolecular complexes that transmit mechanical and biochemical information between extracellular matrix and actin cytoskeleton, regulating diverse cell adhesive processes such as cell migration, cell spreading, and survival. A key step for the PINCH function is its localization to FAs, which depends critically on the tight binding of PINCH to integrin-linked kinase (ILK). Here we report the solution NMR structure of the core ILK·PINCH complex (28 kDa, KD ∼ 68 nm) involving the N-terminal ankyrin repeat domain (ARD) of ILK and the first LIM domain (LIM1) of PINCH. We show that the ILK ARD exhibits five sequentially stacked ankyrin repeat units, which provide a large concave surface to grip the two contiguous zinc fingers of the PINCH LIM1. The highly electrostatic interface is evolutionally conserved but differs drastically from those of known ARD and LIM bound to other types of protein domains. Consistently mutation of a hot spot in LIM1, which is not conserved in other LIM domains, disrupted the PINCH binding to ILK and abolished the PINCH targeting to FAs.

They are mediated by integrin transmembrane receptors, which function by adhering to ECM proteins via their large extracellular domains while connecting to the actin cytoskeleton via their small cytoplasmic tails (20-70 residues) (1Hynes R.O. Cell. 1992; 69: 11-25Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8935) Google Scholar). The integrin-actin connection supports strong cell-ECM adhesion, and its alteration leads to dynamic cell shape change, migration, and survival (2Brakebusch C. Fassler R. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 2324-2333Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). The molecular details of such connection, however, are highly complex, involving a large protein complex network called focal adhesions (FAs) (3Critchley D.R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 133-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar, 4Geiger B. Bershadsky A. Pankov R. Yamada K.M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 793-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (1803) Google Scholar). Integrin-linked kinase (ILK) is a 50-kDa FA protein that contains an N-terminal ankyrin repeat domain (ARD), a middle pleckstrin homology domain, and a C-terminal kinase domain. Originally discovered as an integrin β cytoplasmic tail-binding protein (5Hannigan G.E. Leung-Hagesteijn C. Fitz-Gibbon L. Coppolino M.G. Radeva G. Filmus J. Bell J.C. Dedhar S. Nature. 1996; 379: 91-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (953) Google Scholar), ILK has been established as a major regulator that controls the complex FA assembly and transmits many cell adhesive signals between integrins and actin (6Hannigan G. Troussard A.A. Dedhar S. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2005; 5: 51-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar, 7Wu C.

Biol. 1999; 19: 2425-2434Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar) identified an ILK binding partner called PINCH that contains five LIM domains. Extensive studies have shown that the PINCH binding to ILK is essential for triggering the FA assembly and for relaying diverse mechanical and biochemical signals between ECM and the actin cytoskeleton (9Tu Y. Li F. Goicoechea S. Wu C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2425-2434Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar, 10Zhang Y. Chen K. Tu Y. Velyvis A. Yang Y. Qin J. Wu C. J.

Consistent with the importance of the ILK/PINCH association in almost all cellular behavior and fate, ablation of either ILK (12Sakai T. Li S. Docheva D. Grashoff C. Sakai K. Kostka G. Braun A. Pfeifer A. Yurchenco P.D. Fassler R. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 926-940Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar) or PINCH in mice is embryonically lethal (13Li S. Bordoy R. Stanchi F. Moser M. Braun A.

Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 3056-3062Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). PINCH also has a highly homologous isoform called PINCH-2. However, although complementary to PINCH in many cellular behaviors (for reviews, see Refs. 8Legate K.R. Montanez E. Kudlacek O. Fassler R. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2006; 7: 20-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar and 15Wu C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1692: 55-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), PINCH-2 appears to be involved at the later stage of development (16Braun A. Bordoy R. Stanchi F. Moser M. Kostka G.G. Ehler E. Brandau O. Fassler R. Exp. Cell Res. 2003; 284: 239-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), and thus its ablation in mice is not embryonically lethal (17Stanchi F. Bordoy R. Kudlacek O. Braun A. Pfeifer A. Moser M. Fassler R. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 5899-5910Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). At the clinical level, dysregulation of the ILK/PINCH interaction has been implicated in the development of numerous human disorders such as cancer (6Hannigan G. Troussard A.A. Dedhar S. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2005; 5: 51-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar, 18Huang H.C. Hu C.H. Tang M.C. Wang W.S. Chen P.M. Su Y. Oncogene. 2007; 26: 2781-2790Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) and heart diseases (19Bock-Marquette I. Saxena A. White M.D. Dimaio J.M. Srivastava D. Nature. 2004; 432: 466-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar, 20Chen H. Huang X.N. Yan W. Chen K. Guo L. Tummalapali L. Dedhar S. St-Arnaud R. Wu C. Sepulveda J.L. Lab. Investig. 2005; 85: 1342-1356Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). A Phase I clinical trial is ongoing on a drug called thymosin β-4 (RegeneRx) that appears to specifically target ILK/PINCH for treating myocardial infarction, a major heart failure disorder (19Bock-Marquette I. Saxena A. White M.D. Dimaio J.M. Srivastava D. Nature. 2004; 432: 466-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar). Despite the cellular, physiological, and pathological importance of the ILK/PINCH interaction, the structural basis for how exactly PINCH binds to ILK has not been well understood. Previous biochemical/structural analyses have indicated that ILK utilizes its N-terminal ARD to recognize the LIM1 domain of PINCH, and such binding may promote the targeting of PINCH to FAs (9Tu Y. Li F. Goicoechea S. Wu C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2425-2434Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar, 21Velyvis A. Yang Y. Wu C. Qin J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4932-4939Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). However, the precise atomic basis for such targeting process is elusive. No structure of any ARD·LIM complex has been reported. Using a combination of NMR-based techniques, we have solved the solution structure of the ILK ARD·PINCH LIM1 complex that revealed an interface that is distinct from other ARD and LIM bound to non-ARD/LIM domains. Structure-based mutation of a hot spot in PINCH LIM1, which is not conserved in other LIM domains, abolished the PINCH binding to ILK and its localization to FAs. These results not only reveal a unique LIM/ARD recognition mode but also provide a definitive functional basis for how PINCH is recruited by ILK to focal adhesion site, a major step toward the dynamic cell adhesion and migration processes. DNA Constructs, Protein Expression, and Protein Purification—Initial subcloning, expression, and purification of the ILK ARD and the PINCH-1 LIM1 were described previously (21Velyvis A. Yang Y. Wu C. Qin J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4932-4939Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Additional constructs were made including residues 1-171 of human ILK cloned into pTYB11 (New England Biolabs) and into pGEX-5X-3 (GE Healthcare), respectively. The former construct required no protease digestion because the fusion was chitin that could be cleaved by dithiothreitol thus eliminating the heterogeneity problem often caused by protease digestion using the pGEX construct. The ILK-(1-171) using pTYB11 construct was purified following the manufacturer's instructions (New England Biolabs). The GFP-PINCH-1 mutants for transfection experiments were made as described before (10Zhang Y. Chen K. Tu Y. Velyvis A. Yang Y. Qin J. Wu C. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 4777-4786Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). To prepare 15N- and/or 13C-labeled proteins, cells were grown in M9 minimal medium containing 1.1 g liter-1 [15N]NH4Cl and/or 3.3 g liter-1 [13C]glucose. To prepare partially deuterated samples, cells were grown in minimal medium containing 70-90% 2H2O, but the growth rate for cell culture was slower, and thus the induction time for the protein expression was usually 2 times longer than for the undeuterated sample. Because of a precipitation problem that occurs within a week or two, many samples had to be made for the completion of all NMR experiments as required for the total structure determination. The following six different sets of samples ranging between 0.5 and 0.8 mm were made for various NMR experiments in 25 mm NaH2PO4, 5 mm NaCl, and 0.1-1 mm tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine, pH = 7.0 buffer (note that some samples had to be made several times because of the precipitation problem within a week or two for completion of the NMR experiments): (i) 15N/13C-labeled ILK ARD bound to unlabeled LIM1, (ii) 15N-, 13C-, 70% 2H-labeled ILK ARD bound to unlabeled LIM1, (iii) 15N-labeled ILK ARD bound to unlabeled LIM1, (iv) 15N/13C/2H-labeled LIM1 bound to the unlabeled ILK ARD, (v) 15N/13C-labeled LIM1 bound to unlabeled ILK ARD, and (vi) 15N-labeled LIM1 bound to unlabeled ILK ARD. All the complex samples were purified through an S75 gel filtration column at the final stage and concentrated for NMR experiments. Isothermal Calorimetry Measurements—Isothermal titration calorimetry was performed using a VP-ITC instrument (Microcal, Inc.). The PINCH LIM1 was dialyzed and diluted in 5 mm NaCl and 25 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, to a final concentration of 6 μm. ILK ARD was prepared in the same buffer to 0.1 mm. Titrations consisted of 30 injections each; the final ratio of PINCH LIM1/ILK ARD was ∼1.8 at the end of titrations. The titration curves were fitted, and thermodynamic parameters were calculated using Origin software (Microcal, Inc.). NMR Spectroscopy—All heteronuclear NMR experiments used in the structure determination were reviewed in Ref. 22Clore G.M. Gronenborn A.M. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 1998; 2: 564-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar. All NMR spectra were obtained at 25 °C on a Varian Inova 600-MHz spectrometer and Bruker Avance 800 equipped with a triple resonance probe or 900-MHz spectrometer equipped with a cryogenic triple resonance probe. For resonance assignments of the bound ILK ARD or LIM1, the following triple resonance spectra of HNHA, HNCO, HNCACB, CBCACONH, CCONH, H(CCO)NH, and HCCH total correlation spectroscopy were analyzed in conjunction with three-dimensional 15N/13C-edited NOE experiments. 1DNH residual dipolar couplings were measured using in-phase antiphase experiments (23Ottiger M. Delaglio F. Bax A. J. Magn. Reson. 1998; 131: 373-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (836) Google Scholar) by adding roughly 12 mg/ml phage pf1 into the 15N-labeled ILK ARD/unlabeled LIM1 sample or vice versa. Note that achieving exactly equal phage concentrations for the two complimentary samples was impossible. Fortunately the difference in phage concentration will only lead to an overall scaling in the dipolar coupling in the dipolars, thus magnitude of the alignment tensor (Da). The two sets of dipolar couplings were normalized to give two different Da values based on the distribution of the observed dipolar couplings. The direction of the alignment tensor and its rhombicity remain the same for both samples. Only dipolar couplings for those resonances that are not overlapping and not experiencing broadening due to 1H-1H long range dipolar couplings were included in the structure calculations (86 for the ILK ARD and 23 for the PINCH LIM1). NOE distance restraints for structure calculations were obtained from three-dimensional 15N-edited and 15N/13C-edited three-dimensional NOE spectroscopy spectra (mixing time, 150 ms). 15N/13C-edited 15N-, 13C-filtered three-dimensional NOE spectroscopy (mixing time, 150 ms) was performed to examine the intermolecular NOEs, but because of the highly electrostatic nature of the interaction and the relatively large size of the complex, no intermolecular NOEs were observed. We then prepared 100% deuterated and uniformly 15N-labeled ILK ARD in complex with unlabeled LIM1 and collected high sensitivity 15N-edited NOE spectroscopy spectra on a 900-MHz spectrometer (two mixing times of 300 and 400 ms). A cluster of four intermolecular NOEs (ARD Arg-65 NH/LIM1 Leu-66 Cδ2H3, ARD Gly-66 NH/LIM1 Leu-66 Cδ2H3, ARD Thr-67 NH/LIM1 Leu-66 Cδ2H3, and ARD Asp-68 NH/LIM1 Leu-66 Cδ2H3) were observed. These intermolecular NOEs were further confirmed in three-dimensional 15N- and three-dimensional 15N/13C-edited NOE spectroscopy. The latter also led to the assignment of three additional NOEs: ARD Arg-66 NH/LIM1 Cδ1H3 NOEs, ARD Gly-66 Hα/LIM1 Leu-66 Cδ2H3, and ARD Trp-110 N∊H/LIM1 Ala-39 CβH3. Paramagnetic Spin Labeling Experiment—The cysteine-specific spin label (1-oxyl-2,2,5,5-tetramethylpyrroline-3-methyl-)methanethiosulfonate (MTSSL) was purchased from Sigma. MTSSL was attached to the C-terminal Cys of purified LIM1-(1-70) where the residue 70 is Cys. There is no other free Cys in the construct. The preparation of the MTSSL-labeled LIM1 was as follows: 0.4 mm LIM1 and a 10-fold excess of MTSSL were mixed and stirred for 12 h in a 4:1 (v/v) solution of 25 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, and 10 mm NaCl and acetonitrile. Spin-labeled LIM1 was buffer-exchanged using a p10 column in the buffer containing no acetonitrile, and the final sample was confirmed by mass spectroscopy. The sample was further checked by one-dimensional 1H NMR spectroscopy, and the protein was folded with significant line broadening due to paramagnetic spin label as compared with non-spin-labeled LIM1. 0.3 mm spin-labeled LIM1 was mixed with the 15N-labeled ILK ARD at a 1.3:1 ratio, and the heteronuclear single quantum correlation of the free ILK ARD and the mixture was collected for comparison. Structure Calculations—The structures of bound forms of ILK ARD and PINCH LIM1 domains were calculated separately using protocols described previously (24Vaynberg J. Fukuda T. Chen K. Vinogradova O. Velyvis A. Tu Y. Ng L. Wu C. Qin J. Mol. Cell. 2005; 17: 513-523Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The 1H(N)/15N chemical shift mapping data were transformed into a set of ambiguous, intermolecular distance restraints according to the two criteria defined in Ref. 25Clore G.M. Schwieters C.D. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2003; 125: 2902-2912Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, i.e. the significant chemical shift perturbation of the residues and their surface accessibility in the individual subunits. The dipolar couplings were incorporated into structure calculation as described previously (25Clore G.M. Schwieters C.D. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2003; 125: 2902-2912Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 26De Alba E. Tjandra N. Prog. Nucl. Magn. Reson. Spectrosc. 2002; 40: 175-197Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (145) Google Scholar). The alignment tensor was initially estimated using the histogram approach (27Clore G.M. Gronenborn A.M. Bax A. J. Magn. Reson. 1998; 133: 216-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar) and later optimized by the grid search method as described previously (28Clore G.M. Gronenborn A.M. Tjandra N. J. Magn. Reson. 1998; 131: 159-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). Because the dipolar couplings for the ILK ARD and the PINCH LIM1 were acquired with different samples the magnitude of their Da was optimized separately while keeping the rhombicity and the alignment tensor direction the same. The final optimized Da values are 11.8 and 8.2 Hz for the ILK ARD and the PINCH LIM1, respectively. The optimized rhombicity used was 0.48. The complex structure was obtained by simulated annealing of the ILK ARD and the PINCH LIM1 structures with slowly increasing forces on the intermolecular NOEs, the chemical shift-based intermolecular ambiguous distances, the van der Waals repulsion, and the dipolar coupling restraints. All structures satisfying the experimental restraints (i.e. both the ambiguous intermolecular distance restraints and the dipolar couplings) converge to a single cluster. In the next iteration the ambiguity in the chemical shift-based intermolecular restraints was reduced by examining the resulting structures so that residues that are clearly outside the interaction clusters were eliminated, and a total of 200 final structures were calculated from which 20 with the lowest energies were chosen for analysis and deposited in the Protein Data Bank (code 2kbx). DNA Transfection, Immunoprecipitation, and Immunofluorescence Staining—Human SK-LMS-1 cells were transfected with DNA vectors encoding GFP or GFP-tagged wild type and mutant forms of PINCH-1 using Lipofectamine 2000. One day after the transfection, the cells were analyzed by immunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence staining. For immunoprecipitation, the cells were lysed with 1% Triton X-100 in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4 containing 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm Na4P2O7, 2 mm Na3VO4, 100 mm NaF, and protease inhibitors. The lysates (350 μg) were mixed with 2 μl of rabbit anti-GFP antiserum (Clontech). The anti-GFP immune complexes were precipitated with 20 μl of protein A/G plus-agarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). After washing, the precipitated proteins were released from the beads by boiling in 30 μl of SDS-PAGE sample buffer for 5 min and analyzed by Western blotting with a polyclonal anti-GFP antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or a monoclonal anti-ILK antibody (clone 65.1). The Structure of the ILK ARD/PINCH LIM1 Complex—To understand the nature of the ILK/PINCH interaction, we first decided to measure the binding affinity of the complex by performing the isothermal titration calorimetry experiment. Fig. 1 shows the binding profile of the ILK ARD to PINCH LIM1. Consistent with the large chemical shift changes upon the ILK ARD/PINCH LIM1 interaction (supplemental Fig. S1, a and b), the isothermal titration calorimetry experiment revealed a strong binding affinity at KD ∼68 nm (Fig. 1). The complex was found to be more stable at low salt concentration, although its heteronuclear single quantum correlation perturbation pattern at low salt (supplemental Fig. S1a) is the same as that at high salt condition as shown previously (21Velyvis A. Yang Y. Wu C. Qin J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4932-4939Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The stable interaction at lower ionic strength and the enthalpy-driven nature of the binding (Fig. 1) are consistent with the highly electrostatic interface of the structure as revealed at a later stage of the study. It is also consistent with the fact that only a very limited number of intermolecular NOEs were obtained between the two subunits. The structure of the complex was thus calculated by using residual dipolar couplings and ambiguous chemical shift mapping-based distance constraints (25Clore G.M. Schwieters C.D. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2003; 125: 2902-2912Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) and intermolecular NOEs. Such a protocol successfully led to a well converged structure, which was independently confirmed by multiple additional experiments (see below). Table 1 summarizes the structural statistics for the 20 final calculated structures with the lowest energies. The root mean square deviations for the structures are 1.18 Å for the backbone and 1.64 Å for all heavy atoms (also see Fig. 2A).TABLE 1Structural statistics for the solution structure of the ILK-PINCH complexr.m.s. deviations20 lowest energy conformersLowest energyRestraintsDistances (Å) (3485) conformerIntraresidue |i - j| = 0 (1301)0.030 ± 0.0050.025Sequential |i - j| = 1 (1046)0.095 ± 0.0020.090Short range |i - j| ≤ 5 (676)0.10 ± 0.0120.093Long range |i - j| ≥ 5 (421)0.079 ± 0.0040.068Hydrogen bonds (Å) (329)0.19 ± 0.070.11Dihedrals (°) (368)2.06 ± 0.221.58Residual dipolar couplings (Hz) (109)1DNH (ILK) (86)1.49 ± 0.171.221DNH (LIM) (23)1.32 ± 0.231.07Deviations from idealized covalent geometryBonds (Å) (3790)0.01 ± 0.00020.009Angles (°) (6808)1.4 ± 0.051.3Impropers (°) (2040)1.1 ± 0.031.1Structure qualityLennard-JonesaThe Lennard-Jones van der Waals energy was calculated with the CHARMM PARAM19/20 parameters and was not included in structure calculation. potential energy (kcal/mol)−643 ± 24−671Ramachandran plot analysis (%)All residuesMost favored region70.6 ± 1.473.5Allowed region22.8 ± 1.519.9Generously allowed region4.8 ± 1.13.8Residues ILK 2-154 and LIM 8-67Most favored region75.5 ± 1.477.9Allowed region19.7 ± 1.217.9Generously allowed region3.5 ± 0.72.6Coordinate precisionbThe root mean square (r.m.s.) deviation is reported between the 20 conformers and the mean coordinates.

Notice that the five ANK units in ILK are labeled; they sequentially stack into a cupped hand shape. The two spheres in the PINCH LIM1 (blue) denote two zinc atoms. C, the zoomed region of the ARD showing the characteristic patterns of hydrophobic and hydrophilic interactions, i.e. the hydrophobic interactions are clustered between helices of the ANK units, whereas the hydrophilic interactions are mediated by hairpin loops. The hydrogen bond network between the hairpin loops is highlighted by solid lines. D, the central hydrophobic core linking zinc finger 1 and zinc finger 2 of PINCH LIM1. The side chains in the core are shown in sticks (green). The side chains of zinc (cyan sphere)-coordinating residues are also shown in sticks. Zinc-coordinating residues were deduced based on their geometric positions in structures calculated without zinc and were introduced to coordinate to zinc during the final stage of the structure calculations.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Examination of the structure revealed that the bound ILK ARD (residues 2-154) is quite elongated, containing five sequentially stacked ankyrin repeats (ANKs) (Fig. 2B). Each ANK adopts the typical ANK fold (29Li J. Mahajan A. Tsai M.D. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 15168-15178Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar) with a conserved helixturn-helix conformation preceded by a β-hairpin-like loop with the exception of the first ANK (residues 2-20). The first ANK unit was not recognized previously because of little sequence homology to the consensus ANK sequence, but its ANK fold was clear in our NOE analysis and structure calculations (Fig. 2B). The stacking of the adjacent ANKs is mediated by highly conserved hydrophobic interactions between the helices of the helix-turn-helix motifs and hydrophilic interactions between the hairpin-like loops (Fig. 2C). The hydrophilic interactions involve a series of side-chain and backbone hydrogen bonds and/or salt bridges (Fig. 2C). The overall structure of the ILK ARD is like a cupped hand with hairpin-like loops protruding to one side of the ARD structure (Fig. 2B). Such a sequential folding pattern emphasizes the importance of every ANK unit, especially the middle units because they contact the ANK units both before and after them. Deletion of any of these ANK units, especially the middle units, would disrupt the integrity of the ARD folding (29Li J. Mahajan A. Tsai M.D. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 15168-15178Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar) (supplemental Fig. S2) and its function (30Li F. Zhang Y. Wu C. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 4589-4599Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The bound LIM1 (residues 8-67) adopts the characteristic double zinc finger structure with four antiparallel β-sheets followed by a short helix (Fig. 2B). The overall shape of the bound LIM1 is also elongated (Fig. 2D); this is similar to but not identical to the previously reported unbound LIM1 (21Velyvis A. Yang Y. Wu C. Qin J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4932-4939Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), indicating some binding-induced conformational change. The two zinc fingers are linked by a central hydrophobic core involving Val-24, Tyr-31, Phe-36, Pro-46, Leu-49, Phe-50, and the hydrophobic part of Lys-57 (Fig. 2D). The surface presentation of the whole complex is shown in Fig. 3A, which exhibits a head-to-tail packing. Such packing is consistent with the paramagnetic spin labeling experiment in which adding a bulky spin label (MTSSL) to the C-terminal Cys of LIM1 prevented the LIM1 binding to the ILK ARD (supplemental Fig. S3). Distinct Interaction Features of the ILK ARD·PINCH LIM1 Complex and Comparison with Other ARD or LIM Complexes—Although the structures of the bound the ILK ARD and PINCH LIM1 adopt conserved folding patterns, the binding interface appears to be quite distinct with highly electrostatic nature (Fig. 3, B and C). The interface (∼1800 Å) is larger than the observed average value of 1600 Å for the protein complex interface (31Jones S. Thornton J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (2237) Google Scholar), which is consistent with the tight ILK/PINCH binding (KD ∼ 68 nm). The highly polar feature of the interface also explains why the binding is enthalpy-driven (Fig. 1) and why the complex is more stable at low salt condition. Fig. 4A summarizes the binding site information. Although the majority of the contacts are hydrophilic, a significant"
https://openalex.org/W2013090474,"We have used site-directed spin labeling (SDSL) and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) to identify residues 17 and 137 as sites of interaction between the head domain and rod domain 1A of the intermediate filament protein vimentin. This interaction was maximal when compared with the spin labels placed at up- and downstream positions in both head and rod regions, indicating that residues 17 and 137 were the closest point of interaction in this region. SDSL EPR characterization of residues 120-145, which includes the site of head contact with rod 1A, reveals that this region exhibits the heptad repeat pattern indicative of alpha-helical coiled-coil structure, but that this heptad repeat pattern begins to decay near residue 139, suggesting a transition out of coiled-coil structure. By monitoring the spectra of spin labels placed at the 17 and 137 residues during in vitro assembly, we show that 17-137 interaction occurs early in the assembly process. We also explored the effect of phosphorylation on the 17-137 interaction and found that phosphorylation-induced changes affected the head-head interaction (17-17) in the dimer, without significantly influencing the rod-rod (137-137) and head-rod (17-137) interactions in the dimer. These data provide the first direct evidence for, and location of, head-rod interactions in assembled intermediate filaments, as well as direct evidence of coiled-coil structure in rod 1A. Finally, the data identify changes in the structure in this region following in vitro phosphorylation."

The location of riboflavin in the structure of the enzyme remains unknown. Previously (10Bogachev A.V. Bertsova Y.V. Barquera B. Verkhovsky M.I.

Acta. 2002; 1556: 113-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), using the fact that in the absence of sodium ions, part of the catalytic cycle is dramatically slowed down, we were able to distinguish three main phases in the reduction of the enzyme by NADH. The fast phase, which can be resolved by stopped-flow only under very acid conditions (pH 5.5) and low temperature (4 °C), was assigned to the two-electron reduction of FAD. The intermediate phase had the absorption spectrum of the reduction of a neutral flavosemiquinone radical (FlH·→FlH2), and the slowest step was assigned to the formation of flavosemiquinone anion from the oxidized flavin (Fl→Fl·–). Although the rate of the first phase was not dependent on Na+ concentration, the next two steps were significantly accelerated by sodium ions with an apparent activation constant close to the Km of the enzyme to sodium. In those three phases, we did not resolve the reduction of the 2Fe-2S center. Also it remained completely unknown how two-electron oxidation of NADH is coupled to the one-electron steps seen in the Na+-dependent phases. In addition, the most important question concerns the nature of the fast phase under physiological conditions, which was not resolved because of the high speed of this sodium-independent phase at neutral pH. To answer all these questions, we set up an experiment to resolve the primary steps of NADH oxidation by an ultrafast freeze-quench approach (15Lin Y. Gerfen G.J. Rousseau D.L. Yeh S.R. Anal.

Na+-NQR from Vibrio harveyi was purified as described previously (19Bogachev A.V. Bertsova Y.V. Bloch D.A. Verkhovsky M.I. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 3421-3428Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Stopped-flow Kinetic Measurements—Na+-NQR (3–9 mg ml–1) in buffer A (100 mm KCl, 10 mm HEPES/Tris (pH 7.5), 0.1% n-dodecyl β-d-maltoside (DM)) was rapidly mixed (dead time 3 ms) with an equal volume of buffer A containing 70 μm NADH (potassium salt). To study the Na+-NQR reduction kinetics at pH 5.5, the enzyme in buffer A was rapidly mixed with buffer B (100 mm KCl, 200 mm MES/Tris (pH 5.5), 0.1% DM) containing 70 μm NADH. Rapid mixing experiments were carried out using a stopped-flow spectrophotometer equipped with a diode array detector capable of recording spectra at a rate of up to one per millisecond (Unisoku Instruments or HR2000+ Ocean Optics). All the experiments were performed at 3.5 °C. The background sodium concentration in the mixtures was 30 μm. Spectrum of the formation of the FAD semiquinone from FADH2 was obtained by the oxidation of the reduced NqrF subunit (containing only noncovalently bound FAD as flavin cofactor) by oxygen as described in Ref. 12Turk K.

Data Analysis—Basic data matrix manipulations and presentation were done with MATLAB (The MathWorks, South Natick, MA) (20Morgan J.E. Verkhovsky M.I. Puustinen A. Wikstrom M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 15633-15637Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The data obtained from the stopped flow instrument were analyzed in the form of a surface of absorbance values on the time/wavelength plane. Decomposition of these surfaces was done using a global fitting with the assumption that the kinetics at a given wavelength of the surface can be described by the same exponential processes as at all other wavelengths. We also assume that the catalytic cycle can be represented as a sequence of irreversible monomolecular reactions. With this algorithm, the data surface is described by the formula A(λ,t)=∑n=1m∊n(λ)×cn(t)+∊0(λ)×c0(Eq. 1) and cn(t)=Πi=1m-1ki×∑i=1me-kitΠj=1i≠jm(kj-ki)(Eq. 2) where A(λ,t) is the absorbance at a given time (t) and wavelength (λ); m is the number of sequential reactions; e(l) is the extinction coefficient of the absorbance changes during the reaction step; c is the concentration of the intermediate formed during this step; and ki is the rate constant of this intermediate formation. This formula would be the same for the kinetic data at any wavelength. The amplitudes of the exponential processes are different at different wavelengths, and the vectors ∊1(λ)×c1, ∊2(λ)×c2, ∊3(λ)×c3, etc. are the kinetic difference spectra of optical changes, which proceed in the corresponding exponential process. c0(λ) is a “constant term” spectrum that corresponds to the final state, toward which the entire system is decaying. Freeze-Quench Kinetic Measurements—Na+-NQR (15 mg ml–1) in buffer A (100 mm KCl, 10 mm HEPES/Tris (pH 7.5), 0.1% DM) or buffer C (100 mm NaCl, 10 mm HEPES/Tris (pH 7.5), 0.1% DM) was rapidly mixed with an equal volume of buffer A or buffer C containing 7 or 100 mm NADH (potassium or sodium salt), frozen on the liquid nitrogen cold silver drums, and packed into an EPR tube immersed into the liquid nitrogen bath using an ultrafast freeze-quench apparatus described in Ref. 17Verkhovskaya M.L. Belevich N. Euro L. Wikström M. Verkhovsky M.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2008; 105: 3763-3767Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar. The samples frozen at times from 80 μs to 3.2 ms after mixing the enzyme with NADH were incubated for 30 min at –80 °C to remove traces of liquid oxygen and superoxide oxygen-centered free radicals and were further studied by EPR spectroscopy. It is noteworthy that after mixing, the final concentrations of NADH and the enzyme became 4-fold lower. This was caused by mixing (in 1:1 proportion) and also by two times dilution by the carrier buffer (17Verkhovskaya M.L. Belevich N. Euro L. Wikström M. Verkhovsky M.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2008; 105: 3763-3767Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The apparent concentration of the enzyme in the EPR tube was additionally smaller by a factor of two because the sample in the form of ice powder after packing into the tube occupies 2-fold larger volume than just frozen liquid. EPR Spectroscopy—A Bruker ESP-300 X-band (9.4 GHz) EPR spectrometer was used. The field modulation frequency was 100 kHz. The temperature of the sample was controlled with an ESR 900 liquid helium cryostat with an ITC4 temperature controller (Oxford Instruments). The frequency was calibrated with an HP X532B microwave frequency meter. All EPR data were corrected by subtracting the blank (EPR signal of tube with buffer). EPR signals were quantified by double integration of the experimental spectra obtained under nonsaturated conditions. Determination of Second-order Rate Constant of NADH Oxidation—NADH:hexaammineruthenium oxidoreductase activity of the Na+-NQR was measured at 30 °C in a buffer containing 100 mm KCl, 20 mm HEPES/Tris (pH 7.5), 0.1% DM, 150 μm NADH, and 0.5 or 1 mm hexaammineruthenium. NADH oxidation was monitored by registering the decrease in optical density at 340 nm (∊340 = 6.22 mm–1 cm–1) using a Hitachi-557 spectrophotometer. The rates of NADH oxidation at different concentrations of this reduced pyridine dinucleotide were determined by analyzing the first derivative of the NADH oxidation progress curves. Briefly, the NADH concentration can be calculated from optical density values of a direct OD340 versus time curve, whereas the values of the first derivative of the direct curve are proportional to the rates of NADH oxidation. The data were fitted to the Michaelis-Menten equation using nonlinear regression analysis. The bimolecular rate constant was defined as kcat/Km. The second-order rate constant was 1.5 × 107 m–1 s–1. Determination of the Affinity of Na+-NQR to NAD+—Parameters of NAD+ binding to Na+-NQR were determined by studying the inhibition of the enzyme activity in the presence of this compound. The rates of NADH oxidation by membrane vesicles from the Vibrio harveyi NDKm34 strain (Δndh) (21Fadeeva M.S. Nunez C. Bertsova Y.V. Espin G. Bogachev A.V. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2008; 279: 116-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) at various NADH concentrations were determined as described above. These experiments were carried out in the presence of 0–20 mm NAD+. It was found that NAD+ is a competitive inhibitor of Na+-NQR with kI value of 11 mm. Protein content was determined by the bicinchoninic acid method using bovine serum albumin as a standard. The sodium concentration was measured by flame photometry. Stopped-flow Recording of Na+-NQR Reduction by NADH—The primary steps of Na+-NQR reduction by NADH are rather fast. Even in the absence of sodium ions, there are some fast catalytic steps, which probably occur in turnover earlier than Na+ is bound. However, in agreement with our previous results (10Bogachev A.V. Bertsova Y.V. Barquera B. Verkhovsky M.I. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 7318-7323Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 14Bogachev A.V. Bertsova Y.V. Ruuge E.K. Wikstrom M. Verkhovsky M.I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1556: 113-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), at sufficiently acid conditions, the fast Na+-independent phase became slow enough to be recorded by the stopped-flow technique. Our setup collects a data surface of optical changes during the course of the reaction with the time resolution of 1 ms between the individual spectra in the surface. The time course of the reaction followed at selected wavelength clearly shows the multicomponent behavior. To resolve these components, we applied the global analysis of the recorded surface (see “Experimental Procedures” for details). The fit reveals that such behavior can be best fitted as four sequential steps with time constants (at pH 7.5, 3.5 °C) of 2.3 ms, 35 ms, 0.6 s, and 1.6 s, and the four corresponding kinetic difference spectra were obtained. Fig. 1 shows the kinetic spectrum of the fast phase of Na+-NQR reduction by NADH at pH 5.5 and 3.5 °C. This spectrum corresponds to the two-electron reduction of a flavin. Increase of pH resulted not only in increase of the apparent rate constant of this phase but also in a change of its spectrum. The amplitude of the fast phase obtained in the experiment became smaller because a large part of the reaction proceeds in the dead time of our setup, which is 3 ms. In Fig. 1, the spectra have amplitudes obtained by the fit, taking into account that the reaction starts 3 ms before the recording. As can be seen in Fig. 1, in addition to the troughs at 400 and 460 nm characteristic for the two-electron reduction of a flavin, the neutral pH spectrum also exhibits peaks at 527, 593, and 644 nm (the exact positions of the peaks were defined by the second derivative of the spectrum). This spectrum with three peaks is characteristic for the formation of the neutral flavosemiquinone radical (FlH·) from the reduced flavin. Na+-NQR as isolated, in oxidized form, already contains very stable neutral flavosemiquinone in the concentration of one electron spin per protein (4Barquera B. Hellwig P. Zhou W. Morgan J.E.

Ruuge E.K. Wikstrom M. Verkhovsky M.I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1556: 113-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), which is detected in the enzyme even in the presence of such strong oxidant as ferricyanide (22Juárez O. Nilges M.J. Gillespie P. Cotton J. Barquera B. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 33162-33167Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Lately it was shown that this neutral flavin radical is formed from noncovalently bound riboflavin (22Juárez O. Nilges M.J. Gillespie P. Cotton J. Barquera B. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 33162-33167Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). However, the positions of the maxima of its spectrum are different and significantly blue-shifted (λmax = 522, 578, and 629 nm (14Bogachev A.V. Bertsova Y.V. Ruuge E.K. Wikstrom M. Verkhovsky M.I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1556: 113-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar)). Thus, the spectral changes for the fast kinetic phase cannot be attributed to riboflavin reduction (oxidation). It is noteworthy that the red shift of the long wavelength peaks is characteristic of the FAD radical in ferredoxin:NADP+ oxidoreductases of the FNR family (23Batie C.J. Kamin H. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 11976-11985Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Konas D.W. Takaya N. Sharma M. Stuehr D.J. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 12596-12609Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), including FAD semiquinone in the NqrF subunit of Na+-NQR (12Turk K. Puhar A. Neese F. Bill E. Fritz G. Steuber J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 21349-21355Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Two spectra, one representing the formation of the FAD semiquinone in the NqrF subunit (Fig. 2, curve 2) and the other, which is the long wavelength region of the kinetic spectrum of the fastest phase (curve 1), are shown in Fig. 2. The stationary spectrum of the FAD neutral radical was obtained by NADH-induced reduction of the NqrF catalytic subunit in the presence of oxygen (see Ref. 12Turk K. Puhar A. Neese F. Bill E. Fritz G. Steuber J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 21349-21355Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). It is absolutely clear that the two spectra are very similar and likely represent the redox transition of the same compound. This compound is FAD in the NqrF subunit, and we propose that at neutral pH, it can form a significant quantity of the radical state. As it is clear from the data in Fig. 1, the [Na+]-independent kinetic phase consists of more than one process. At pH 5.5, it is just two-electron reduction of the FAD, whereas at neutral pH, this two-electron reduction occurs in the dead time of the instrument and a subsequent step of electron separation is already seen. The time resolution of the stopped-flow device is not sufficient to resolve all fast events of the catalytic cycle. This is why we decided to apply the ultrafast freeze-quench approach. Freeze-Quench Recording of Na+-NQR Reduction by NADH—The ultrafast freeze-quench method makes possible the trapping of enzyme intermediates and consequent analysis of their chemical structure using different physical methods, particularly EPR, which is very informative in the case of Na+-NQR. Our setup (17Verkhovskaya M.L. Belevich N. Euro L. Wikström M. Verkhovsky M.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2008; 105: 3763-3767Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) can stop the reaction on the time scale from about 100 μs to a few milliseconds after mixing. The fast stop in the approach is realized by freezing of a high speed (in our case ∼100 m/s) 25-μm-thick jet of mixed solution on the surface of rotating liquid-nitrogen cold silver cylinders. Fast mixing was achieved by the dramatic decrease of the mixing volumes (down to ∼1 nl). The time of the reaction, defined by the jet fly time required for the sample leaving the mixing device to get to the freezing cylinders, and the increase of the reaction time were achieved by increasing the distance between mixer and silver cylinders. Using this method, we studied the fast steps of the catalytic cycle, which cannot be resolved by optical spectroscopy using the stopped-flow approach. As we mentioned above, the oxidized Na+-NQR contains neutral flavosemiquinone in the ratio 1:1 per enzyme molecule and therefore shows an EPR signal with the g = 2.00 and 20 G line width (10Bogachev A.V. Bertsova Y.V. Barquera B. Verkhovsky M.I. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 7318-7323Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). This is why at the zero time point obtained by the mixing of the enzyme with the buffer without NADH, there is a spectrum (Fig. 3A) of this radical. After the initiation of the reaction with NADH, the radical concentration increased with time. The additional radical signal (3.5 ms minus 0 ms) has g = 2.00 and is characterized by a slightly narrower bandwidth (∼18 G). Nevertheless, this shape of the appearing radical signal is characteristic for a neutral flavosemiquinone because it is significantly wider than the signal derived from the anionic form of the flavosemiquinone (∼14 G) (25Palmer G. Muller F. Massey V. Kamin H. Flavins and Flavoproteins. University Park Press, Baltimore, MD1971: 123-139Google Scholar). Such a conclusion is in good agreement with our optical spectroscopy data (see above). The reaction of the enzyme with NADH also resulted in the appearance of one more well characterized EPR signal belonging to the 2Fe-2S cluster with gxy = 1.94 (Fig. 3B). This signal is absent at zero time and reaches about 50% at 3.2 ms after the start of the reaction. The relative amplitude of the signal was found by its comparison with the signal from the fully reduced enzyme, which was obtained from the same enzyme batch by mixing with dithionite and taking into account the ice powder packing factor (see “Experimental Procedures”). Having a radical signal from the enzyme in the concentration of one electron spin per protein before the start of the reaction (14Bogachev A.V. Bertsova Y.V. Ruuge E.K. Wikstrom M. Verkhovsky M.I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1556: 113-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) allows us to quantitatively determine the time course of the reaction. The integral of this signal corresponds to the microwave absorbance by one electron spin per enzyme. We can plot an additional signal appearing during the reaction as a fraction of the primary signal (Fig. 4) and have the kinetic curves of the reaction components development in time. As can be seen from Fig. 4, the flavosemiquinone radical signal (filled squares) develops absolutely synchronously with the reduction of 2Fe-2S cluster (filled circles). After the short lag, they both rose to about 50%. The solid line on the figure drawn through the data points represents the fit of those points with the kinetic model for the two-step sequential reaction with the parameters: k1 = 3200 s–1 and k2 = 970 s–1. The experimental points were obtained in medium without sodium ions (background [Na+] ∼30 μm). The results of the same experiment conducted in the presence of 100 mm of Na+ were very similar (data not shown). Rate of NADH Binding—In our fast kinetic measurements, we should be sure that the reaction rate is not limited by the rate of NADH binding. For that purpose, we determined the bimolecular rate constant of NADH oxidation by the enzyme using a simple steady-state approach. For example, at a hexaammineruthenium concentration of 1 mm, the apparent Km of NADH oxidation was defined as 80 μm. The kcat obtained in the same experiments was 1200 s–1. Thus, the ratio of kcat/KMapp should give the bimolecular rate constant, which was determined as 1.5 × 107 m–1 s–1. Such a bimolecular rate constant defines the time constant of NADH binding in our freeze-quench experiments at the minimal used NADH concentration 1/(1.75 × 10–3 m × 1.5 × 107 m–1 s–1) = 38 μs. This means that under our conditions, the Na+-NQR reduction was not limited by the rate of NADH binding. In agreement with this conclusion, it was found that the parameters of the studied reaction were almost the same even after 15-fold increase in the NADH concentration used (data not shown). Another important parameter of the system was defined by the steady-state approach. It is the time of the release of the product of the reaction, NAD+, from the enzyme. Using the competitive inhibition methodology, we found that the binding constant for NAD+ is very poor and has a value of about 11 mm. Because the diffusion properties of such similar molecules as NAD+ and NADH are very similar, we can assume that the bimolecular rate constant that we found for NADH binding is also valid for NAD+ (this assumption could be incorrect if, for example, charge of the cofactor is important for its delivery to the binding site). Knowledge of these two numbers gives us the lifetime of the NAD+-enzyme complex: 1/(11 × 10–3 m × 1.5 × 107 m–1 s–1) = 6 μs. This very low value means that the release of NAD+ from Na+-NQR cannot limit the rate of any step of the enzyme catalytic cycle. Primary Steps of the Reaction—The kinetic traces of 2Fe-2S cluster reduction and formation of FADH· has a lag phase during which the preceding reactions occur. The time constant for these EPR silent reactions is 320 μs. Because the binding of NADH did not take more than 38 μs, it is clear that there is at least one more process. By optical spectroscopy, we have seen that it should be two-electron reduction of FAD, which is a very common mechanism of NADH oxidation by direct hydride ion transfer from NADH to the flavin (17Verkhovskaya M.L. Belevich N. Euro L. Wikström M. Verkhovsky M.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2008; 105: 3763-3767Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Thus, we conclude that the concerted transfer of two electrons and the proton from NADH to FAD in the active site of Na+-NQR takes about 300 μs. As can be seen from Fig. 4, in the next step of the reaction, FAD shares its electron with the 2Fe-2S cluster forming 50% of reduced FAD and 50% of flavosemiquinone, which indicates establishing of quasi-equilibrium with the time constant of 1 ms. FADH2·Fe2S2ox⇆K=1FADH··Fe2S2red(Eq. 3) The equilibrium constant of this reaction dramatically depends on pH, and acid conditions stabilize the two-electron form of FAD (Fig. 1). The overall scheme of the primary events developing in the NqrF subunit can be seen in Fig. 5. Comparison of Kinetic Quasi-equilibrium with Thermodynamic Equilibrium—The equilibrium redox titration at pH 7.5 showed that the midpoint redox potential of FAD is –200 mV and that the titration curve has a slope characteristic for a two-electron reduction (19Bogachev A.V. Bertsova Y.V. Bloch D.A. Verkhovsky M.I. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 3421-3428Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), which itself would argue against stable semiquinone formation. Even more surprising is the movement of an electron from FADH2 to the 2Fe-2S center because it has midpoint redox potential more negative than the flavin (–270 mV) (10Bogachev A.V. Bertsova Y.V. Barquera B. Verkhovsky M.I. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 7318-7323Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Thus, the formation of the semiquinone from FADH2 and the reduction of the 2Fe-2S cluster by FADH2 are both endergonic reactions, and according to the values of the midpoint redox potentials, the reduced FAD should not give electrons to the 2Fe-2S cluster, and at neutral pH, the redox equilibrium depicted in Reaction 1 should be shifted to the left as we observe it under acid conditions. The most likely scenario is that during fast kinetics, the system passes transient states that cannot be accessed during equilibrium titration. There is also a possibility that in the presence of NADH during the fast phase, not only two electrons and a proton are transferred to the enzyme, but also the next molecule of NADH is bound (see scheme in Fig. 5). If NADH binding changes the redox properties of the FAD, then such unusual quasi-equilibrium can be explained by the formation of this complex."

ApoE-/- or LDLR-/- mice receiving bone marrow from LXRαβ-/- mice showed a marked increase in lesion size (5Tangirala R.K. Bischoff E.D. Joseph S.B. Wagner B.L. Walczak R. Laffitte B.A. Daige C.L.

The administration of a synthetic LXR ligand to these knock-out models decreased atherosclerotic lesions (6Terasaka N. Hiroshima A. Koieyama T. Ubukata N. Morikawa Y. Nakai D. Inaba T.

In addition, synthetic LXR agonists confer an anti-diabetic effect in db/db diabetic mice (8Cao G. Liang Y. Broderick C.L. Oldham B.A. Beyer T.P. Schmidt R.J. Zhang Y. Stayrook K.R. Suen C. Otto K.A.

In light of these findings, LXR agonists could be pharmacological agents for treating vascular disease associated with hyperlipidemia. However, current synthetic LXR ligands markedly increase hepatic lipogenesis and plasma level of triglycerides, largely because of the induction of sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1c (SREBP-1c) and its downstream targets in the liver (9Chisholm J.W. Hong J. Mills S.A. Lawn R.M. J. Lipid Res. 2003; 44: 2039-2048Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). The loss of LXR results in a different effect on the expression of ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1) and SREBP-1c, which indicates that LXRs interact differentially with the transcription machinery present in target gene promoters (10Wagner B.L. Valledor A.F. Shao G. Daige C.L. Bischoff E.D. Petrowski M. Jepsen K. Baek S.H. Heyman R.A. Rosenfeld M.G. Schulman I.G. Glass C.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 5780-5789Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). SREBPs, including SREPB-1a, -1c, and -2, are transcription factors that regulate genes involved in cholesterol and fatty acid metabolism. SREBP-1c activates genes involved in fatty acid synthesis. SREBP-2 augments genes regulating cholesterol biosynthesis, whereas SREBP-1a seems to be engaged in both pathways. In cells with abundant sterols, SREBPs bind to insulin-inducing gene (Insig)-1 and -2, together with SREBP cleavage-activating protein (SCAP), at the rough endoplasmic reticulum membrane. Upon sterol deprivation, SREBPs are cleaved in the Golgi apparatus to release their amino acid termini, which then translocate to the nucleus, where they bind to the sterol regulatory element (SRE) in the promoters of various target genes. Sharing 59% sequence homology, Insig-1 and Insig-2 bind to SCAP in a sterol-dependent fashion (11Yang T. Espenshade P.J. Wright M.E. Yabe D. Gong Y. Aebersold R. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S.

Kalaany et al. (16Kalaany N.Y. Gauthier K.C. Zavacki A.M. Mammen P.P. Kitazume T. Peterson J.A. Horton J.D. Garry D.J. Bianco A.C. Mangelsdorf D.J.

Remarkably, this phenotype depended on the presence of cholesterol in the diet. 2,3-Oxidosqualene cyclase (OSC) is a unique microsomal enzyme in the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway. OSC catalyzes not only the conversion of 2,3-monoepoxysqualene (MOS) to lanosterol but also the cyclization of 2,3;22,23-diepoxysqualene (DOS) to 24(S),25-epoxylanosterol, which is subsequently transformed into oxysterol 24,25-EC, a potent naturally occurring ligand of LXR (3Rowe A.H.

J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 700-707Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Synthesis of 24,25-EC overrides cholesterol synthesis when OSC is partially inhibited because DOS has a lower Km for OSC than does MOS (17Telford D.E. Lipson S.M. Barrett P.H. Sutherland B.G.

Through its dual function, OSC inhibition can reduce cholesterol biosynthesis and enhance 24,25-EC synthesis. Recently, 24,25-EC was found to selectively upregulate LXR target genes involved in cholesterol efflux in macrophages, but had no effect on genes related to fatty acid synthesis or triglyceride accumulation (19Beyea M.M. Heslop C.L. Sawyez C.G. Edwards J.Y. Markle J.G. Hegele R.A. Huff M.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 5207-5216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Thus, OSC becomes an attractive target for inhibition of cholesterol synthesis. Given the paradoxical improvement of the hepatic lipid profile by LXR with an HF diet, we compared the role of LXRα in lipid metabolism in an overexpression mouse model fed normal chow or an HF diet. The HF diet with LXRα overexpression increased the expression of LXR-targeted genes involved in cholesterol reverse transport but not those involved in fatty acid synthesis. We showed that increased cholesterol level suppressed the expression of OSC, leading to an increase in endogenous LXR ligand(s). These results suggest that endogenous ligands caused by a Western HF diet up-regulate the LXR target genes involved in cholesterol efflux but not those linked to fatty acid synthesis and triglyceride accumulation. Thus, the modulation of LXR function by modulating OSC may provide a paradigm for an alternative strategy in the treatment of fatty liver, atherosclerosis, and metabolic syndrome. Cell Culture and Reagents-The human hepatoma cell line HepG2 was maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone, Logan, UT). HEK293 cells were cultured in DMEM with 5% fetal bovine serum. Primary hepatocytes were isolated from male Sprague-Dawley rats by modified two-step collagenase liver perfusion (20Seglen P.O. Methods Cell Biol. 1976; 13: 29-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (5220) Google Scholar). The isolated hepatocytes were seeded onto culture plates coated with rat-tail collagen I in RPMI 1640 media supplemented with 10% FBS and antibiotics. The adherent hepatocytes were cultured at 37 °C under 5% CO2 overnight before various treatments. For the treatment with LXR agonists, 5 μm 22R-HC (Sigma) was included in the medium. Adenovirus Purification and Infection-Recombinant adenoviruses encoding green fluorescence protein (GFP), LXRα, and HA-nSREBP-1c were constructed and amplified as previously described (21Lu M. Shyy J.Y. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2006; 290: 1477-1486Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 22Zhu M. Fu Y. Hou Y. Wang N. Guan Y. Tang C. Shyy J.Y. Zhu Y. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2008; 28: 527-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Virus particles were purified by cesium chloride gradient and concentrated by use of Sephadex-G-25 M columns (23Riddell D.R. Zhou H. Comery T.A. Kouranova E. Lo C.F. Warwick H.K. Ring R.H. Kirksey Y. Aschmies S. Xu J. Kubek K. Hirst W.D. Gonzales C. Chen Y. Murphy E. Leonard S. Vasylyev D. Oganesian A. Martone R.L. Pangalos M.N. Reinhart P.H. Jacobsen J.S. Mol. Cell Neurosci. 2007; PubMed Google Scholar). The titers of virus (PFU) were determined in HEK293 cells (24Wang N. Verna L. Liao H. Ballard A. Zhu Y. Stemerman M.B. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2001; 21: 1414-1420Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). HepG2 and rat primary hepatocytes were infected with recombinant adenoviruses at the indicated multiplicity of infection (MOI) and incubated for 24–48 h prior to experiments. Animal Model and Treatment-C57BL/6J mice were bred at the breeding facility of the Peking University Health Science Center. In accordance with the guidelines of the Protection of Laboratory Animals, all animal procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the Peking University Health Science Center. The mice were maintained under a 12-h light/12-h dark cycle and fed standard laboratory chow and tap water ad libitum. Eight-week-old male mice were fed a chow diet or a Western HF diet (0.15% cholesterol, 21% fat) for 8 weeks. For adenoviral infection, the mice under different diets were separated into various groups of GFP (n = 10), LXRα (n = 10), and SREBP-1c(N) (n = 4), according to treatment with Ad-GFP, Ad-LXRα, or Ad-SREBP-1c(N) at 1 × 109 PFU in 0.1 ml of saline administered through tail-vein injection. Levels of fasting blood glucose were measured after a 6-h fast by use of a portable glucometer (ACCUCHEK II; Roche Applied Science). Seven days after adenovirus injection, mice were anesthesized and killed. The blood samples were withdrawn from the mouse saphenous vein, and plasma insulin concentrations were measured by use of an ultrasensitive I125-linked immunosorbent assay kit (Fu Rui Inc., Beijing, China). Liver tissues were dissected and stored at -80 °C until analysis. Western Blot Analysis-Liver tissue was ground in a lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 10 μg/ml pepstatin A). After ultrasonication, specimens were centrifuged and the supernatant was collected. Equal amounts of lysates (50 μg/lane) were separated on 10% SDS-PAGE. Western blot analysis involved antibodies against LXRα, ABCA1 (Novus Biologicals, Littleton, CO), SREBP-1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), and β-actin (Biosynthesis Biotech, Beijing, China). Real-time PCR Analysis-Total RNA was isolated using the TRIzol reagent (Applygen, Beijing, China) and reverse-transcribed using the Reverse Transcription System kit (Promega). The forward and reverse primers are listed in supplemental Table S1. The synthesized cDNA was mixed with the primers in the TaqMan PCR Master Mix (Tiangen, Beijing, China). SYBR Green I was used to monitor amplification of DNA detected by the MX3000P QPCR system (Stratagene). The relative amount of mRNA was calculated by use of the comparative CT method. Gene expression was normalized to β-actin levels. Histological and Oil-red O Staining-Histochemical analysis of mouse liver sections, preparation and Oil-red O staining of frozen or paraffin-embedded liver sections were performed as previously described (25Arai S. Shelton J.M. Chen M. Bradley M.N. Castrillo A. Bookout A.L. Mak P.A. Edwards P.A. Mangelsdorf D.J. Tontonoz P. Miyazaki T.

After staining, slides were washed three times in water and photographed using an Eclipse TE2000 inverted microscope system (Nikon Instruments, Inc.) at ×40 magnification. Serum and Liver Lipid Determination-Samples of animal serum were collected, and lipoproteins were separated by fast performance liquid chromatography (FPLC) (Amersham Biosciences). The amount of plasma lipoproteins in serum or the FPLC fractions was detected by use of an automated clinical chemistry analyzer kit (Biosino Biotech). For quantification of liver cholesterol and triglycerides, liver sections were homogenized, which were extracted with chloroform:methanol (2:1). The lipid fractions were dried under nitrogen (15Lehrke M. Lebherz C. Millington S.C. Guan H.P. Millar J. Rader D.J. Wilson J.M. Lazar M.A. Cell Metab. 2005; 1: 297-308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). For cholesterol and triglyceride measurement, the dried lipids of the aliquot were dissolved in 5% Triton X-100 in H2O and determined using the chemistry analyzer kit. Luciferase Activity Assay-pABCA1 (-928)-luc, p-ACC1-luc, LXREx3, TK-luc, and CMX-GAL-hLXRα with a GAL4 reporter were described previously (27Zeng L. Liao H. Liu Y. Lee T.S. Zhu M. Wang X.

For transient transfection, plasmid DNA was transfected into HepG2 cells by use of the jetPEI method (PolyPlus, Illkirch, France), then cells underwent various treatments for 24 h. pRSV-β-gal was co-transfected as a transfection control. Twenty-four hours post-transfection, cells were lysed, and luciferase activities were measured and normalized to that of β-galactosidase. RNA Interference (RNAi)-siRNA for OSC or scramble control siRNA were synthesized by Sigma, and the sequence of OSC siRNA was 5′-CTATGTGTCTCTCAGAATT-3′. siRNA was transfected into HepG2 cells by the N-TER method (Sigma) for 24 h. Then the siRNA-targeted cells underwent various treatments for another 24 h. Total RNA or lysis protein was collected for further analysis. For in vivo OSC knockdown experiment, pSIREN-OSC plasmid was constructed according to the manufacturer’s instructions (RNAi-Ready pSIREN system, Clontech). pSIREN-OSC plasmid was delivered by use of a modified hydrodynamic transfection method as described previously (29Song E. Lee S.K. Wang J. Ince N. Ouyang N. Min J. Chen J. Shankar P. Lieberman J. Nat. Med. 2003; 9: 347-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (1029) Google Scholar). Briefly, 50 μg of plasmid dissolved in 2.5 ml of phosphate-buffered saline was rapidly injected into the mouse tail vein. An equal volume of vector control was injected in control mice. At 48 h after injection, mice were anesthesized and killed. Liver tissues were dissected and stored at -80 °C until analysis. 24,25-EC Determination and Quantification-Liver tissue lipids were extracted, and then high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) was performed as described (30McDonald J.G. Thompson B.M. McCrum E.C. Russell D.W. Methods Enzymol. 2007; 432: 145-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Internal control 22S-HC (Sigma) was added into samples before the lipid extraction. 24,25-EC was analyzed by an HPLC instrument (Waters™ 600–2487) with a reverse-phase C18 column and a binary gradient solvent of 5 mm ammonium acetate in methanol and water. The relative peak areas of 24,25-EC in the samples were used to calculate the amount of 24,25-EC by comparing with 22S-HC, the internal standard. Data Analysis-The significance of variability was determined by an unpaired two-tailed Student’s t test or analysis of variance. Each experiment involved triplicate measurements for each condition tested, unless indicated otherwise. All results are expressed as mean ± S.E. from at least three independent experiments. p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Generation of Mice Models Overexpressing LXRα in Liver with Different Diets-To investigate the effect of LXRα in the liver of mice under an HF diet, C57BL/6J mice were fed an HF diet, then intravenously injected with Ad-hLXRα or control Ad-GFP. The animals were sacrificed 7 days post-injection. Both LXRα mRNA and protein levels were higher in the livers of mice receiving Ad-LXRα than in Ad-GFP-infected controls (supplemental Fig. S1, A and B). The HF diet or LXRα overexpression alone was sufficient for lipid accumulation in the liver, as evidenced by Oil-red O staining (Fig. 1A). However, the HF diet seemed to reduce the effect of LXRα in lipid accumulation. Cholesterol content, but not triglyceride content, was higher with the HF diet than with LXRα overexpression (Fig. 1B). Serum lipoprotein analysis by FPLC showed that HF diet increased plasma cholesterol in all fractions. With hepatic LXRα overexpression, the fractions of low density lipoprotein (LDL) in mice fed the chow diet were higher than those in mice fed the HF diet (Fig. 1C). In addition, hyperinsulinemia in the LXRα-treated mice was reversed under the HF diet, which indicated improved insulin sensitivity (Table 1). Thus, the interplay between diet and hepatic LXR level seems to play a critical role in fatty liver and serum lipid profiles.TABLE 1The index of insulin sensitivity and liver lipid of mice with HF diet and LXRα overexpressionChowHigh fatAd-GFPAd-LXRαAd-GFPAd-LXRαBody weight (g)23.71 ± 1.63aData are expressed as mean ± S.E.23.33 ± 0.7324.89 ± 2.3224.31 + 0.87LW/BW (%)5.14 ± 0.176.77 + 0.24bp < 0.01 vs Ad-GFP with chow diet4.91 ± 0.235.96 ± 0.35cp < 0.05 vs Ad-GFP with HF dietLiver chol (mg/g)2.44 ± 0.182.75 + 0.294.13 ± 0.40bp < 0.01 vs Ad-GFP with chow diet3.25 ± 0.27cp < 0.05 vs Ad-GFP with HF dietLiver TG (mg/g)12.30 ± 0.8523.55 + 3.22bp < 0.01 vs Ad-GFP with chow diet26.94 ± 2.29bp < 0.01 vs Ad-GFP with chow diet26.34 + 1.17Blood glucose (mmol/l)5.33 ± 0.695.08 + 0.355.71 ± 1.065.28 + 0.78Plasma insulin (mU/ml)29.37 ± 2.3240.65 + 2.49bp < 0.01 vs Ad-GFP with chow diet36.07 ± 1.84dp < 0.0534.95 + 3.18HOMA-IR7.01 + 1.968.27 + 2.499.11 ± 2.228.62 + 3.02a Data are expressed as mean ± S.E.b p < 0.01 vs Ad-GFP with chow dietc p < 0.05 vs Ad-GFP with HF dietd p < 0.05 Open table in a new tab HF Diet Increases the Expression of Genes Related to Reverse Cholesterol Transport-LXR regulates genes involved in cholesterol efflux (e.g. ABCA1) and/or fatty acid synthesis (31Ory D.S. Circ. Res. 2004; 95: 660-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). To study the mechanism by which LXRα differentially affects lipid metabolism in the liver under distinct diets, we examined the expression of these two types of LXR-targeted genes. Hepatic ABCA1 protein level was up-regulated by LXRα overexpression in conjunction with an HF diet (Fig. 2A). The synergistic effect was observed in mice receiving HF diet and Ad-hLXRα (HF+LXRα), which demonstrated the activation of hepatic LXR. Quantitative real-time PCR revealed that genes involved in reverse cholesterol transport, namely, ABCA1, ABCG5, ABCG8, and Cyp7α1, were moderately up-regulated by LXRα but significantly up-regulated by HF+LXRα. However, genes regulating lipid synthesis, such as FAS and ACC1, were greatly up-regulated by LXRα overexpression. A similar pattern was observed with SCD-1 but did not reach statistical significance. The HF diet had little effect on the mRNA level of these genes. SREBP-1c, the key transcriptional factor involved in fatty acid synthesis, is known to regulate FAS, ACC1, and SCD-1, but itself is a target gene of LXRα. Interestingly, SREBP-1c, similar to ABCA1, was up-regulated in the HF+LXRα group (Fig. 2B). These results suggest mechanisms other than SREBP-1c transcriptional regulation involved in the dysregulation of FAS, ACC1, and SCD-1 under the HF diet. LXRα and Its Ligand Differentially Regulate the Expression of LXRα-targeted Genes-Given that an HF diet may provide endogenous ligand(s) of LXR to selectively up-regulate genes involved in reverse cholesterol transport, we examined the effect of LXRα and oxysterol, an endogenous LXR ligand, on the expression of LXRα-targeted genes. We infected HepG2 cells with Ad-LXRα or treated cells with 22R-HC, an LXR endogenous ligand. ABCA1 was synergistically up-regulated in cells expressing LXRα and treated with 22R-HC (Fig. 3A). The mRNA level was increased in genes encoding proteins related to reverse cholesterol transport but not those for lipid synthesis, which was similar to that found in vivo (Fig. 3B versus Fig. 2B). From these in vitro and in vivo results, we hypothesized that the LXR ligands differentially affect the promoter activities of these genes involved in reverse cholesterol transport and lipogenesis. The luciferase assay showed that LXRα increased the ABCA1 promoter activity in HepG2 cells in a ligand-dependent manner (Fig. 3C, left panel). As expected, LXR overexpression in the absence of a ligand (22R-HC) increased the ACC promoter activity (Fig. 3C, right panel). When the ligand was present, the ACC promoter activity remained at the basal level. These results suggest that while ABCA1 up-regulated by LXR was ligand-dependent, that of ACC was ligand-independent. LXRα Increases SREBP-1c Transcription but Inhibits Its Maturation-Although SREBP-1c mRNA level was up-regulated by LXRα overexpression in mice under the HF diet and with the endogenous ligand in cultured hepatocytes, the expression of genes involved in fatty acid synthesis exhibited a ligand-independent pattern. The activity of SREBPs is known to be controlled at both transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels. We studied whether LXRα also regulates SREBP-1c at the post-transcriptional level by detecting the level of the SREBP-1 precursor and its nuclear form. With LXRα and the HF diet, the level of both forms of SREBP-1c was increased in the liver (Fig. 4A), but the HF diet decreased the level of the mature form of SREBP-1c and conferred a lower ratio of nuclear to precursor form than with LXRα alone (Fig. 4B). Thus, the HF diet might inhibit cleavage via augmenting anchor proteins to prevent SREBP-1 translocation from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi network. Recently, TO901317, a synthetic LXR agonist, was reported to enhance the expression of Insig-2a, the major Insig variant in the liver (14Hegarty B.D. Bobard A. Hainault I. Ferre P. Bossard P. Foufelle F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 791-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). We therefore detected the expression of Insig-2a in mouse groups. LXRα, together with the HF diet, increased the level of hepatic insig-2a in vivo (Fig. 4C). Similar results were obtained in cultured HepG2 cells with the LXR ligand (Fig. 4D). Thus, Insig-2a was up-regulated by LXRα in a ligand-dependent manner, which, in turn, inhibited the maturation of SREBP-1c. Diet Had No Effect on the Outcome of Overexpressed Nuclear SREBP-1c-SREBP-1 is the transcription factor governing hepatic lipogenesis, and SREBP-1c is the major form of SREBP-1 in rodents. To study whether diet directly affect SREBP-1c target genes, we injected mice with adenovirus encoding the nuclear form of human SREBP-1c (nSREBP-1c), then determined the protein and mRNA expression after 7 days. The overexpression of nSREBP-1C in the liver was confirmed at the protein level (supplemental Fig. S2A). Consistent with previous study (32Shimano H. Trends Cardiovasc. Med. 2000; 10: 275-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), the nSREBP-1c overexpression induced severe lipid accumulation (supplemental Fig. S2B) and up-regulated its target genes FAS, ACC, and SCD-1 (supplemental Fig. S2C). However, diet had little effect on changes caused by overexpressing nSREBP-1c. HF Diet Reduced OSC Expression in the Liver to Produce the Ligand of LXR-To further confirm that the HF diet provided endogenous ligands of LXR, we explored the possible endogenous LXR ligands induced by the HF diet. Partial inhibition of OSC could attenuate cholesterol synthesis and increase the production of 24,25-EC, an endogenous ligand of LXR (18Wong J. Quinn C.M. Gelissen I.C. Brown A.J. J. Biol.

Both the full-length ArsR and the ArsR-DBD behaved as monomers in size exclusion chromatography experiments. The structure of ArsR-DBD consists of an N-terminal four-stranded β-sheet, a helical core, and a C-terminal β-hairpin. The overall tertiary fold of the ArsR-DBD is most closely related to DBD structures of the OmpR/PhoB subfamily of bacterial response regulators. However, the orientation of the N-terminal β-sheet with respect to the rest of the DNA-binding domain is substantially different in ArsR compared with the orientation in related response regulators. Molecular modeling of an ArsR-DBD-DNA complex permits identification of protein elements that are predicted to bind target DNA sequences and thereby regulate gene transcription in H. pylori. The Helicobacter pylori ArsS-ArsR two-component signal transduction system, comprised of a sensor histidine kinase (ArsS) and a response regulator (ArsR), allows the bacteria to regulate gene expression in response to acidic pH. We expressed and purified the full-length ArsR protein and the DNA-binding domain of ArsR (ArsR-DBD), and we analyzed the tertiary structure of the ArsR-DBD using solution nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) methods.

Molecular modeling of an ArsR-DBD-DNA complex permits identification of protein elements that are predicted to bind target DNA sequences and thereby regulate gene transcription in H. pylori. Helicobacter pylori is a spiral-shaped Gram-negative organism that persistently colonizes the stomach in about half of the human population (1Parsonnet J. Hansen S. Rodriguez L. Gelb A.B. Warnke R.A.

H. pylori infection is a risk factor for the development of gastric cancer, a leading cause of cancer-related deaths in many parts of the world. Furthermore, H. pylori has been identified as a major risk factor for peptic ulcer disease and gastric lymphoma (1Parsonnet J. Hansen S. Rodriguez L. Gelb A.B. Warnke R.A. Jellum E. Orentreich N.

Within the human stomach, H. pylori encounters a range of acidic pH conditions (6Ang S. Lee C.Z. Peck K. Sindici M. Matrubutham U. Gleeson M.A. Wang J.T. Infect.

Immun. 2003; 71: 5921-5939Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Upon entry of H. pylori into the stomach, the bacterium encounters gastric luminal pH values that range from 1 while fasting to 5 after a meal. After the initial transit of H. pylori through the gastric lumen, the bacterium thrives in the gastric mucus layer, where the pH is thought to be 4.5-6.5 (11Schade C. Flemstrom G. Holm L. Gastroenterology. 1994; 107: 180-188Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Within the mucus layer, the bacterium is still subject to considerable pH fluctuations as a consequence of the changing luminal pH. Therefore, H. pylori has evolved mechanisms to survive severe acid shock and grow under moderately acidic conditions. One of the important mechanisms by which H. pylori responds to acidic pH involves regulation of gene expression through a two-component signal transduction system (12Beier D. Frank R. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 2068-2076Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 13Dietz P. Gerlach G. Beier D. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 350-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 14Loh J.T.

Two-component systems (TCS) 2The abbreviations used are: TCS, two component system; ArsR, acid-responsive signaling regulator; ArsS, acid-responsive signaling sensor; DBD, DNA-binding domain; RR, response regulator; wHTH, winged helix-turn-helix; HSQC, heteronuclear single quantum correlation; Tricine, N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine; NOESY, nuclear Overhauser effect (NOE) spectroscopy; r.m.s.d., root mean square deviation. are stimulus-response coupling mechanisms that are used primarily by prokaryotic organisms to regulate cellular functions in response to changing environmental conditions (21Hall M.N. Silhavy T.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1981; 146: 23-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). TCSs are composed of a sensor histidine kinase protein and a response regulator (RR) protein. In a typical TCS, the histidine kinase detects and monitors an environmental condition and transmits information via a phosphotransfer event to the cognate RR. Most RRs consist of two domains, an N-terminal regulatory domain and a C-terminal effector domain. Phosphorylation of the RR induces a conformational change in the regulatory domain, which results in activation of the effector domain. The majority of RRs are transcription factors with DNA binding effector domains (DBDs) (22Stock A.M. Robinson V.L. Goudreau P.N. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 183-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (2471) Google Scholar). In contrast to the Escherichia coli genome, which contains 62 open reading frames (ORFs) encoding TCS component proteins (23Mizuno T. DNA Res. 1997; 4: 161-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar), the H. pylori genome contains only 10 ORFs encoding TCS-component proteins (24Tomb J.F. White O. Kerlavage A.R. Clayton R.A.

Borodovsky M. Karp P.D. Smith H.O. Fraser C.M. Venter J.C. Nature. 1997; 388: 539-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (3027) Google Scholar). This paucity of regulatory genes in the H. pylori genome could reflect the pathogen's tight adaptation to its restricted ecological niche and also the lack of competition from other microorganisms in the acidic gastric environment (12Beier D. Frank R. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 2068-2076Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 25Eguchi Y. Utsumi R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2005; 30: 70-72Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Several recent studies reported that an H. pylori TCS, ArsS-ArsR (acid-responsive signaling sensor/response regulator), responds to acidic conditions (12Beier D. Frank R. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 2068-2076Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 13Dietz P. Gerlach G. Beier D. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 350-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 14Loh J.T.

This TCS consists of the histidine kinase protein, ArsS, and the RR protein, ArsR. Evidence supporting a cognate relationship between ArsS and ArsR includes immediate proximity of the two genes in the H. pylori chromosome and the demonstration that the two purified proteins can participate in a phosphotransfer reaction in vitro (12Beier D. Frank R. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 2068-2076Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). H. pylori ArsS null mutants are viable, but such mutants are impaired in the ability to grow in low pH in vitro, and these mutant strains are unable to colonize mice (14Loh J.T. Cover T.L. Infect. Immun. 2006; 74: 3052-3059Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 15Panthel K. Dietz P. Haas R. Beier D. Infect. Immun. 2003; 71: 5381-5385Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Attempts to generate ArsR null mutants have been unsuccessful, which suggests that ArsR is essential for H. pylori viability (12Beier D. Frank R. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 2068-2076Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). One approach for identifying members of the ArsRS regulon has been to isolate DNA sequences that bind to ArsR. This approach resulted in the identification of two operons (designated HP1408-1412 and HP427-423 in H. pylori strain 26695) and a family of paralogous genes (exemplified by HP0119) that are regulated by the ArsRS system (13Dietz P. Gerlach G. Beier D. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 350-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). These genes encode proteins of unknown function. As another approach to identify members of the ArsRS regulon, whole-genome transcriptional profiles of wild-type H. pylori and ArsS mutant strains have been compared. Such studies have been done following growth of the bacteria at either neutral pH or acidic pH. Whole-genome transcriptional profiling of H. pylori strains cultured in low pH conditions identified more than 100 genes that were differentially expressed in the wild-type strain compared with an ArsS-deficient mutant (17Pflock M. Finsterer N. Joseph B. Mollenkopf H. Meyer T.F. Beier D. J. Bacteriol. 2006; 188: 3449-3462Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Transcriptional profiling of H. pylori cultured in neutral pH conditions identified a smaller number of genes that were differentially expressed in the wild-type and ArsS null mutant strains (26Forsyth M.H. Cao P. Garcia P.P. Hall J.D. Cover T.L. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 4630-4635Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Acid-responsive H. pylori genes that are differentially expressed in wild-type and arsS mutant strains include amidases (amiE, amiF) and members of the urease gene cluster (ureA, ureB, ureE, ureF, ureG, ureH, and ureI) (9Merrell D.S. Goodrich M.L. Otto G. Tompkins L.S. Falkow S. Infect. Immun. 2003; 71: 3529-3539Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 10Wen Y. Marcus E.A. Matrubutham U. Gleeson M.A. Scott D.R. Sachs G.

Immun. 2005; 73: 6437-6445Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Gel-shift and DNA-footprinting analyses have shown that ArsR binds directly to the promoter regions of these genes (17Pflock M. Finsterer N. Joseph B. Mollenkopf H. Meyer T.F. Beier D. J. Bacteriol. 2006; 188: 3449-3462Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 18Pflock M. Kennard S. Delany I. Scarlato V. Beier D. Infect. Immun. 2005; 73: 6437-6445Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Thus, the ArsRS TCS has an important role in allowing H. pylori to regulate gene expression in response to changes in pH and also has an important role in allowing H. pylori to colonize the gastric mucosa (15Panthel K. Dietz P. Haas R. Beier D. Infect. Immun. 2003; 71: 5381-5385Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that the periplasmic domain of ArsS detects low pH conditions (16Pflock M. Dietz P. Schar J. Beier D. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2004; 234: 51-61Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Pflock M. Kennard S. Finsterer N. Beier D. J. Biotechnol. 2006; 126: 52-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), triggering an ATP-dependent autophosphorylation reaction at a conserved histidine residue in the protein cytoplasmic domain. This model proposes that the signal from ArsS is then transduced to the cognate RR protein, ArsR, via a phosphotransfer reaction from the phosphohistidine kinase to a conserved aspartate residue (Asp-52) in ArsR, which leads to modification of the ArsR regulatory functions (for review, see Refs. 22Stock A.M. Robinson V.L. Goudreau P.N. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 183-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (2471) Google Scholar and 27Pflock M. Kennard S. Finsterer N. Beier D. J. Biotechnol. 2006; 126: 52-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). A derivative of ArsR with a D52N mutation is not phosphorylated in vitro by ArsS. In contrast to an arsR null mutant (which is non-viable) (28Schar J. Sickmann A. Beier D. J. Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 3100-3109Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), a mutant H. pylori strain expressing the D52N form of ArsR is viable. These findings suggest that this mutant form of ArsR has a function that is sufficient for cell viability. Based on these data, it seems likely that there are two sets of target genes for ArsR. One set of genes in the ArsR regulon is presumed to be essential for cell viability, and regulation of these genes can be accomplished by a non-phosphorylated form of ArsR (exemplified by the D52N mutant protein) (12Beier D. Frank R. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 2068-2076Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 28Schar J. Sickmann A. Beier D. J. Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 3100-3109Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). A second set of genes in the ArsR regulon is not required for cell viability, and the regulation of these genes occurs by a pathway involving a phosphorylated form of ArsR (i.e. requiring the cognate histidine kinase, ArsS) (13Dietz P. Gerlach G. Beier D. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 350-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 17Pflock M. Finsterer N. Joseph B. Mollenkopf H. Meyer T.F. Beier D. J. Bacteriol. 2006; 188: 3449-3462Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 18Pflock M. Kennard S. Delany I. Scarlato V. Beier D. Infect. Immun. 2005; 73: 6437-6445Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 20Wen Y. Feng J. Scott D.R. Marcus E.A. Sachs G. J. Bacteriol. 2006; 188: 1750-1761Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 26Forsyth M.H. Cao P. Garcia P.P. Hall J.D. Cover T.L. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 4630-4635Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 29Wen Y. Feng J. Scott D.R. Marcus E.A. Sachs G. J. Bacteriol. 2007; 189: 2426-2434Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The products of various genes in the latter group contribute to acid acclimation, and thus host colonization, by H. pylori. It should be noted that genes belonging to the former set (required for cell viability) have not yet been identified. Although several lines of evidence indicate that the ArsS-ArsR TCS has an important role in H. pylori, many features of this TCS are still not understood. Specifically, very little is known about how the structure and function of ArsR are altered in response to phosphorylation, little is known about how this TCS contributes to acid adaptation, and virtually nothing is known about what functions of ArsR are required for H. pylori viability. Herein, we report the structure of the DNA binding effector domain of ArsR as determined by solution NMR. Plasmid Construction-The ArsR protein encoded by H. pylori strain J99 comprises 225 amino acids (GenBank™ accession number Q9ZMR6). The DNA-binding domain of this protein, mapped based on comparison to other known response regulators such as PhoB and OmpR, comprises 103 amino acids, beginning at Glu-123 and ending at Tyr-225. The full-length arsR gene and a fragment encoding the DNA-binding domain were amplified by PCR from H. pylori strain J99 (gene JHP0152) using genomic DNA as template and pairs of primers including 5′ BamHI and 3′ KpnI restriction endonuclease sites (5′-CGGGATCCATGATAGAAGTTTTAATGATAGAAGATGATATAG and 5′-CGGGTACCTCAGTATTCTAATTTATAACCAATCCCTCT for full-length ArsR and 5′-GCGGGATCCGAAGAGGTGAGTGAGCCAGGC and 5′-GCGGGTACCTCAGTATTCTAATTTATAACCAATCCCTCT for ArsR-DBD). Purified PCR products were digested with KpnI and BamHI restriction enzymes (Promega, Madison, WI) and ligated into linearized pET-BNK, a modified pET vector (Novagen, Madison, WI) developed specifically for expressing NMR protein targets. The vector contains a 5′-coding sequence for an N-terminal purification tag MRGSHHHHHHGS in-frame with the insert coding for the desired proteins. Expression and Purification of ArsR and ArsR-DBD-For preparation of NMR samples, transformed E. coli BL21 (DE3) cells were grown in 4.2 liters of LB media containing glucose (2 g/liter) and ampicillin (50 mg/liter). When the culture reached an A600 of 1.0, protein expression was induced for 4 h with 0.8 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. Cells were collected by 10 min of centrifugation at 12,000 × g, suspended in 0.02 m Na2HPO4, 0.5 m NaCl, pH 7.6, and then lysed by sonication 6 times for 30 s on ice. Both 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 5 mm Tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine hydrochloride were added before sonication. After sonication, the preparation was centrifuged at 31,000 × g for 20 min. The supernatant (∼100 ml) was collected and applied to a 30-ml metal affinity chromatography column (His-Bind, Novagen) charged with Ni2+. The column was washed with a 0-80 mm imidazole gradient to remove proteins bound non-specifically to the column, and the protein of interest was eluted with a 0.08-1.0 M imidazole gradient over 45 ml. 5-ml fractions corresponding to peaks of interest were collected, pooled, and concentrated to a volume of 1 ml in Amicon Ultra-15 centrifugal filters (10-kDa molecular weight cut-off (MWCO) membrane for the full-length protein and a 5-kDa MWCO membrane for the DBD). The purity of the proteins was assessed by Tricine SDS-PAGE on 10% gels. Protein samples estimated to be >95% pure were analyzed by NMR. 15N- and 13C,15N-labeled samples were produced by a process similar to that described above, but cells were grown in M9 medium with the addition of 13C-labeled glucose and 15N-labeled ammonium chloride (CIL, Andover, MA). Analytical Size Exclusion Chromatography-The proteins were analyzed by gel filtration on a Sephacryl S-100 fast protein liquid chromatography column (GE Healthcare) run at 4 °C in 0.02 m Na2HPO4, 0.5 m NaCl, 1 mm Tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine hydrochloride (pH 7.6) and a flow rate of 0.4 ml/min, with ultraviolet absorption measured at 214 nm. ArsR and ArsR-DBD molecular weights (Mr) were determined by calculating their partition coefficient (Kav) values and using a calibration curve, plotting logarithmic values of Mr against calculated Kav values for a set of standard globular monomeric proteins (bovine serum albumin (66 kDa), ovalbumin (45 kDa), and myoglobin (16.7 kDa)), run under identical conditions. Kav values were calculated using the formula Kav = (Ve - Vo)/(Vt - Vo), where Ve is elution volume, Vo is column void volume, and Vt is total column volume. NMR Structure Calculation-NMR spectra were acquired for ArsR and ArsR-DBD on an Avance 600 Bruker (Billerica, MA) spectrometer with a triple resonance gradient probe and a cryoprobe. Sample protein concentrations were ∼0.2 mm (full-length protein) and ∼0.5 mm (DBD) in 0.5 m NaCl, 0.02 m Na2HPO4, 1 mm Tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine hydrochloride (pH 7.6). Spectra were collected at 25 °C for unlabeled (natural abundance), 15N-labeled, and 13C,15N-labeled protein samples. The data were processed using XWINNMR and TOPSPIN software (Bruker) and analyzed with the Sparky suite (Goddard TD and Kneller DG, Sparky 3, University of California, San Francisco). The assignment of backbone resonances was completed using data from two-dimensional 1H,15N HSQC, two-dimensional NOESY, and three-dimensional CBCANH and CBCA(CO)NH experiments. The side chain resonance assignments were completed using data from three-dimensional HCC total correlation spectroscopy (TOCSY), HHC-TOCSY, H(CC)(CO)NH, HCC(CO)NH, HBHA(CO)NH, 15N-edited NOESY, and 13C-edited NOESY experiments (for references, see Ref. 30Sattler M. Schleucher J. Griesinger C. Progress in Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy. 1999; 34: 93-158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (1396) Google Scholar). The chemical shifts of Hα, Cα, Cβ, and C′ were analyzed with chemical shift index software (31Wishart D.S. Sykes B.D. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 239: 363-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (939) Google Scholar) to produce a prediction of secondary structure elements. J-coupling constants calculated from HNHA experiments were used to determine φ angle constraints for structure calculations. The chemical shifts of Hα, Cα, Cβ, C′, and N were also analyzed to calculate angle constraints to be used for structure calculations using TALOS software (32Cornilescu G. Delaglio F. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1999; 13: 289-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (2740) Google Scholar). The structures were calculated using the CYANA Version 2.1 software package (33Guntert P. Mumenthaler C. Wuthrich K. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 273: 283-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (2558) Google Scholar). Automatic calibration was used to convert the NOE peak intensities into distance constraints. The final calculations were performed for 1000 structures with 40,000 annealing steps for each. The 50 structures with the lowest target functions (≤0.6) were minimized with AMBER (Version 9) (34Case D.A. Darden T.A. Cheatham III, T.E. Simmerling C.L. Wang J. Duke R.E. Luo R. Merz K.M.

The stereochemistry of the structures was analyzed with PROCHECK-NMR (39Laskowski R.A. Rullmannn J.A. MacArthur M.W. Kaptein R. Thornton J.M. J. Biomol.

NMR Analysis of ArsR-DBD in Complex with the Promoter Region of a Target Gene-Two-dimensional 1H,15N HSQC spectra were collected for purified 15N-labeled ArsR-DBD alone (0.1 mm) and ArsR-DBD combined with a 13-bp dsDNA fragment (5′-CGCATCATTAACC) (0.1 mm) from the promoter region of a well characterized ArsR target gene, hp1408 (13Dietz P. Gerlach G. Beier D. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 350-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). This DNA fragment corresponds to the 5′ half of a DNA binding region identified by footprinting analysis (13Dietz P. Gerlach G. Beier D. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 350-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Sequence Comparison of ArsR and Related Proteins-Sequence alignment of ArsR and several structurally characterized response regulators (OmpR (GenPept accession number AAC76430), PhoB (GenPept accession number AAC73502), DrrD (GenPept accession number 1KGS_A)) was carried out using ClustalW (40Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (55973) Google Scholar). The sequence of ArsR from H. pylori strain J99 was also compared with ArsR from other H. pylori strains (26695 and HPAG1) and orthologs from Helicobacter acinonychis (Sheeba), Helicobacter hepaticus (ATCC 51449), Wolinella succinogenes (strain DSM 1740), Campylobacter lari (RM 2100), Campylobacter curvus (525.92), and Campylobacter concisus (13826). ArsR and ArsR-DBD Biochemical Characterization-The full-length His6-tagged ArsR protein (237 residues) and a His6-tagged ArsR fragment corresponding to the DBD (115 residues) were overexpressed in E. coli, recovered from soluble fractions of the cell lysate, and purified by metal affinity chromatography. Gel filtration experiments conducted on ArsR and ArsR-DBD demonstrated that the proteins migrated with molecular masses of ∼32 kDa (expected monomer size, ∼27 kDa) and ∼19 kDa (expected monomer size, ∼13 kDa), respectively (data not shown). The larger than expected apparent molecular sizes were most likely caused by the 17-residue disordered N termini of proteins. These data suggest that both ArsR and ArsR-DBD are monomeric in solution at concentrations below 0.1 mm. ArsR and ArsR-DBD protein samples were concentrated to ∼0.2 and ∼0.5 mm, respectively, and analyzed by NMR. The directly detected 31P NMR experiments conducted on purified full-length ArsR (in Tris buffer), which contains a putative phosphate-receiving aspartate residue, did not reveal any detectable phosphate signal, suggesting that the majority of the purified protein is in the unphosphorylated form (data not shown). One-dimensional 1H NMR spectra of ArsR showed well dispersed peaks in regions characteristic of amide protons (6-10 ppm) and aliphatic protons (0-4 ppm), indicative of folded protein. ArsR-DBD was produced in natural abundance and in 15N- and 13C,15N-enriched forms. Fig. 1A shows that the 1H,15N correlation NMR spectrum of ArsR-DBD exhibited good chemical shift dispersion. A comparison of 1H,15N HSQCs of full-length ArsR and ArsR-DBD showed that ArsR-DBD amide proton peaks aligned with ArsR amide peaks, indicating that the structure of the isolated ArsR-DBD was very similar to that domain in the full-length protein (Fig. 1B). ArsR-DBD Structural Determination-Backbone NH resonance assignments were obtained (Fig. 1A) for all residues of the ArsR-DBD, except for the first 11 residues of the 12-residue N-terminal His6 tag, 4 proline residues, and 2 isoleucine residues (Ile-176 and Ile-192, numbered based on the sequence of untagged full-length ArsR). The solution structure of ArsR-DBD was determined by NMR based on 1265 distance constraints, including 264 intraresidue, 329 sequential, 360 medium range, and 312 long range distance constraints, and 155 dihedral angle constraints calculated using TALOS (32Cornilescu G. Delaglio F. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1999; 13: 289-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (2740) Google Scholar) and J-coupling constants calculated from HNHA experiments. Table 1 summarizes the structural statistics for the calculations. The first 17 residues of the protein (including the 12 residues from the His6 tag) showed very few NOE interactions and chemical shifts, a finding that is characterist"
https://openalex.org/W2040558211,"Background Repairing DNA damage begins with its detection and is often followed by elicitation of a cellular response. In E. coli, RecA polymerizes on ssDNA produced after DNA damage and induces the SOS Response. The RecA-DNA filament is an allosteric effector of LexA auto-proteolysis. LexA is the repressor of the SOS Response. Not all RecA-DNA filaments, however, lead to an SOS Response. Certain recA mutants express the SOS Response (recAC) in the absence of external DNA damage in log phase cells. Methodology/Principal Findings Genetic analysis of two recAC mutants was used to determine the mechanism of constitutive SOS (SOSC) expression in a population of log phase cells using fluorescence of single cells carrying an SOS reporter system (sulAp-gfp). SOSC expression in recA4142 mutants was dependent on its initial level of transcription, recBCD, recFOR, recX, dinI, xthA and the type of medium in which the cells were grown. SOSC expression in recA730 mutants was affected by none of the mutations or conditions tested above. Conclusions/Significance It is concluded that not all recAC alleles cause SOSC expression by the same mechanism. It is hypothesized that RecA4142 is loaded on to a double-strand end of DNA and that the RecA filament is stabilized by the presence of DinI and destabilized by RecX. RecFOR regulate the activity of RecX to destabilize the RecA filament. RecA730 causes SOSC expression by binding to ssDNA in a mechanism yet to be determined."
https://openalex.org/W2133720866,"In general, signal amplitude in optical imaging is normalized using the well-established DeltaF/F method, where functional activity is divided by the total fluorescent light flux. This measure is used both directly, as a measure of population activity, and indirectly, to quantify spatial and spatiotemporal activity patterns. Despite its ubiquitous use, the stability and accuracy of this measure has not been validated for voltage-sensitive dye imaging of mammalian neocortex in vivo. In this report, we find that this normalization can introduce dynamic biases. In particular, the DeltaF/F is influenced by dye staining quality, and the ratio is also unstable over the course of experiments. As methods to record and analyze optical imaging signals become more precise, such biases can have an increasingly pernicious impact on the accuracy of findings, especially in the comparison of cytoarchitechtonic areas, in area-of-activation measurements, and in plasticity or developmental experiments. These dynamic biases of the DeltaF/F method may, to an extent, be mitigated by a novel method of normalization, DeltaF/DeltaF(epileptiform). This normalization uses as a reference the measured activity of epileptiform spikes elicited by global disinhibition with bicuculline methiodide. Since this normalization is based on a functional measure, i.e. the signal amplitude of ""hypersynchronized"" bursts of activity in the cortical network, it is less influenced by staining of non-functional elements. We demonstrate that such a functional measure can better represent the amplitude of population mass action, and discuss alternative functional normalizations based on the amplitude of synchronized spontaneous sleep-like activity. These findings demonstrate that the traditional DeltaF/F normalization of voltage-sensitive dye signals can introduce pernicious inaccuracies in the quantification of neural population activity. They further suggest that normalization-independent metrics such as waveform propagation patterns, oscillations in single detectors, and phase relationships between detector pairs may better capture the biological information which is obtained by high-sensitivity imaging."
https://openalex.org/W1994604062,"Heterochromatin assembly in fission yeast is initiated by binding of Swi6/HP1 to the Lys-9-dimethylated H3 followed by spreading via cooperative recruitment of Swi6/HP1. Recruitment of Cohesin by Swi6/HP1 further stabilizes the heterochromatin structure and integrity. Subsequently, polyubiquitylation of Cut2 by anaphase-promoting complex-cyclosome (APC/C)-ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase (E3 ligase) followed by degradation of Cut2 releases Cut1, which cleaves the Rad21 subunit of Cohesin, facilitating sister chromatid separation during mitosis. Here, we demonstrate a surprising role of APC/C in assembly of heterochromatin and silencing at mating type, centromere, and ribosomal DNA loci. Coincidentally with the loss of silencing, recruitment of Swi6, H3-Lys-9-Me2, and Clr4 at dg-dh repeats at cen1 and the K region of mat locus is abrogated in mutants cut4, cut9, and nuc2. Surprisingly, both Cut4 and Cut9 are also highly enriched at these regions in wild type and depleted in swi6Delta mutant. Cut4 and Cut9 interact directly with Swi6/HP1 and Clr4, whereas the mutant Cut4 does not, suggesting that a direct physical interaction of APC subunits Cut4 and Cut9 with Swi6 and Clr4 is instrumental in heterochromatin assembly. The silencing defect in APC mutants is causally related to ubiquitylation activity of APC-E3 ligase. Like swi6 mutant, APC mutants are also defective in Cohesin recruitment and exhibit defects like lagging chromosomes, chromosome loss, and aberrant recombination in the mat region. In addition, APC mutants exhibit a bidirectional expression of dh repeats, suggesting a role in the RNA interference pathway. Thus, APC and heterochromatin proteins Swi6 and Clr4 play a mutually cooperative role in heterochromatin assembly, thereby ensuring chromosomal integrity, inheritance, and segregation during mitosis and meiosis."
https://openalex.org/W2132713704,"The mammalian gonad arises as a bipotential primordium from which a testis or ovary develops depending on the chromosomal sex of the individual. We have previously used DNA microarrays to screen for novel genes controlling the developmental fate of the indifferent embryonic mouse gonad. Maestro (Mro), which encodes a HEAT-repeat protein, was originally identified as a gene exhibiting sexually dimorphic expression during mouse gonad development. Wholemount in situ hybridisation analysis revealed Mro to be expressed in the embryonic male gonad from approximately 11.5 days post coitum, prior to overt sexual differentiation. No significant expression was detected in female gonads at the same developmental stage. In order to address its physiological function, we have generated mice lacking Maestro using gene targeting. Male and female mice homozygous for a Mro null allele are viable and fertile. We examined gonad development in homozygous male embryos in detail and observed no differences when compared to wild-type controls. Immunohistochemical analysis of homozygous mutant testes of adult mice revealed no overt abnormalities. Expression profiling using DNA microarrays also indicated no significant differences between homozygote embryonic male gonads and controls. We conclude that Maestro is dispensable for normal male sexual development and fertility in laboratory mice; however, the Mro locus itself does have utility as a site for insertion of transgenes for future studies in the fields of sexual development and Sertoli cell function."
https://openalex.org/W2002402196,"Lyme disease is a common vector-borne disease caused by the spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi (Bb), which manifests as systemic and targeted tissue inflammation. Both in vitro and in vivo studies have shown that Bb-induced inflammation is primarily host-mediated, via cytokine or chemokine production that promotes leukocyte adhesion/migration. Whether Bb produces mediators that can directly alter the vascular permeability in vivo has not been investigated. The objective of the present study was to investigate if Bb produces a mediator(s) that can directly activate endothelial cells resulting in increases in permeability in intact microvessels in the absence of blood cells.The effects of cell-free, spent culture medium from virulent (B31-A3) and avirulent (B31-A) B. burgdorferi on microvessel permeability and endothelial calcium concentration, [Ca(2+)](i), were examined in individually perfused rat mesenteric venules. Microvessel permeability was determined by measuring hydraulic conductivity (Lp). Endothelial [Ca(2+)](i), a necessary signal initiating hyperpermeability, was measured in Fura-2 loaded microvessels. B31-A3 spent medium caused a rapid and transient increase in Lp and endothelial [Ca(2+)](i). Within 2-5 min, the mean peak Lp increased to 5.6+/-0.9 times the control, and endothelial [Ca(2+)](i) increased from 113+/-11 nM to a mean peak value of 324+/-35 nM. In contrast, neither endothelial [Ca(2+)](i) nor Lp was altered by B31-A spent medium.A mediator(s) produced by virulent Bb under culture conditions directly activates endothelial cells, resulting in increases in microvessel permeability. Most importantly, the production of this mediator is associated with Bb virulence and is likely produced by one or more of the 8 plasmid(s) missing from strain B31-A."
