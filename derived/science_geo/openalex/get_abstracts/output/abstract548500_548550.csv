https://openalex.org/W2206837932,"At the atomic-cluster scale, pure boron is markedly similar to carbon, forming simple planar molecules and cage-like fullerenes. Theoretical studies predict that two-dimensional (2D) boron sheets will adopt an atomic configuration similar to that of boron atomic clusters. We synthesized atomically thin, crystalline 2D boron sheets (i.e., borophene) on silver surfaces under ultrahigh-vacuum conditions. Atomic-scale characterization, supported by theoretical calculations, revealed structures reminiscent of fused boron clusters with multiple scales of anisotropic, out-of-plane buckling. Unlike bulk boron allotropes, borophene shows metallic characteristics that are consistent with predictions of a highly anisotropic, 2D metal."

We found that a nitrogen-doped ordered mesoporous few-layer carbon has a capacitance of 855 farads per gram in aqueous electrolytes and can be bipolarly charged or discharged at a fast, carbon-like speed. The improvement mostly stems from robust redox reactions at nitrogen-associated defects that transform inert graphene-like layered carbon into an electrochemically active substance without affecting its electric conductivity. These bipolar aqueous-electrolyte electrochemical cells offer power densities and lifetimes similar to those of carbon-based supercapacitors and can store a specific energy of 41 watt-hours per kilogram (19.5 watt-hours per liter)."

Our surveillance in Saudi Arabia in 2014 and 2015 showed that viruses of the MERS-CoV species and a human CoV 229E-related lineage co-circulated at high prevalence, with frequent co-infections in the upper respiratory tract of dromedary camels. viruses of the betacoronavirus 1 species, we found that dromedary camels share three CoV species with humans. Several MERS-CoV lineages were present in camels, including a recombinant lineage that has been dominant since December 2014 and that subsequently led to the human outbreaks in 2015. Camels therefore serve as an important reservoir for the maintenance and diversification of the MERS-CoVs and are the source of human infections with this virus."

Malinsky et al. investigated how two ecomorphs of cichlid fish in a small lake in Tanzania are diversifying relative to each other. Although there is gene flow between the two forms, major regions of genetic divergence, known as genomic islands, separate the populations. Within these islands, the authors found genes likely to be associated with mate choice, supporting the idea that genetic changes related to breeding preferences are the first to diverge during speciation.

https://openalex.org/W2207318443,"From sensing leucine to metabolic control The mTORC1 protein kinase complex plays central roles in regulating cell growth and metabolism and is implicated in common human diseases such as diabetes and cancer. The level of the amino acid leucine tells an organism a lot about its physiological state, including how much food is available, how much insulin is going to be needed, and whether new muscle mass can be made (see the Perspective by Buel and Blenis). Wolfson et al. identified a biochemical sensor of leucine, Sestrin2, which connects the concentration of leucine to the control of organismal metabolism and growth. When leucine bound to Sestrin2, it was released from a complex with the mTORC1 regulatory factor GATOR2, activating the mTORC1 complex. Saxton et al. describe the crystal structure of Sestrin2 and show how it specifically detects leucine. Aylett et al. determined the structure of human mTORC1 by cryoelectron microscopy and the crystal structure of a regulatory subunit, Raptor. The results reveal the structural basis for the function and intricate regulation of this important enzyme, which is also a strategic drug target.

The virus is common in dromedary camels, which can be a source of human infections. In a survey for MERSCoV in over 1300 Saudi Arabian camels, Sabir et al. found that dromedaries share three coronavirus species with humans. Diverse MERS lineages in camels have caused human infections, which suggests that transfer among host species occurs quite easily. Haagmans et al. made a MERS-CoV vaccine for use in camels, using poxvirus as a vehicle. The vaccine significantly reduced virus excretion, which should help reduce the potential for transmission to humans, and conferred cross-immunity to camelpox infections.

https://openalex.org/W2218496732,"Upon stimulation with Th1 cytokines or bacterial lipopolysaccharides, resting macrophages shift their phenotype toward a pro-inflammatory state as part of the innate immune response. LPS-activated macrophages undergo profound metabolic changes to adapt to these new physiological requirements. One key step to mediate this metabolic adaptation is the stabilization of HIF1α, which leads to increased glycolysis and lactate release, as well as decreased oxygen consumption. HIF1 abundance can result in the induction of the gene encoding pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 1 (PDK1), which inhibits pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) via phosphorylation. Therefore, it has been speculated that pyruvate oxidation through PDH is decreased in pro-inflammatory macrophages. However, to answer this open question, an in-depth analysis of this metabolic branching point was so far lacking. In this work, we applied stable isotope-assisted metabolomics techniques and demonstrate that pyruvate oxidation is maintained in mature pro-inflammatory macrophages. Glucose-derived pyruvate is oxidized via PDH to generate citrate in the mitochondria. Citrate is used for the synthesis of the antimicrobial metabolite itaconate and for lipogenesis. An increased demand for these metabolites decreases citrate oxidation through the tricarboxylic acid cycle, whereas increased glutamine uptake serves to replenish the TCA cycle. Furthermore, we found that the PDH flux is maintained by unchanged PDK1 abundance, despite the presence of HIF1. By pharmacological intervention, we demonstrate that the PDH flux is an important node for M(LPS) macrophage activation. Therefore, PDH represents a metabolic intervention point that might become a research target for translational medicine to treat chronic inflammatory diseases."

https://openalex.org/W2217782636,"Critical among the changes that occur with aging are decreases in muscle mass and metabolic rate and an increase in fat mass. These changes may predispose older adults to chronic disease and functional impairment; ultimately resulting in a decrease in the quality of life. Research has suggested that long chain omega-3 fatty acids, found predominantly in fatty fish, may assist in reducing these changes. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of fish oil (FO) supplementation in a cohort of healthy, community-dwelling older females on 1) metabolic rate and substrate oxidation at rest and during exercise; 2) resting blood pressure and resting and exercise heart rates; 3) body composition; 4) strength and physical function, and; 5) blood measures of insulin, glucose, c-reactive protein, and triglycerides. Twenty-four females (66 ± 1 yr) were recruited and randomly assigned to receive either 3g/d of EPA and DHA or a placebo (PL, olive oil) for 12 wk. Exercise measurements were taken before and after 12 wk of supplementation and resting metabolic measures were made before and at 6 and 12 wk of supplementation. The results demonstrated that FO supplementation significantly increased resting metabolic rate by 14%, energy expenditure during exercise by 10%, and the rate of fat oxidation during rest by 19% and during exercise by 27%. In addition, FO consumption lowered triglyceride levels by 29% and increased lean mass by 4% and functional capacity by 7%, while no changes occurred in the PL group. In conclusion, FO may be a strategy to improve age-related physical and metabolic changes in healthy older females. Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01734538."

https://openalex.org/W2212466265,"In 2014, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) launched its first tobacco-focused public education campaign, The Real Cost, aimed at reducing tobacco use among 12- to 17-year-olds in the United States. This study describes The Real Cost message strategy, implementation, and initial evaluation findings. The campaign was designed to encourage youth who had never smoked but are susceptible to trying cigarettes (susceptible nonsmokers) and youth who have previously experimented with smoking (experimenters) to reassess what they know about the “costs” of tobacco use to their body and mind. The Real Cost aired on national television, online, radio, and other media channels, resulting in high awareness levels. Overall, 89.0% of U.S. youth were aware of at least one advertisement 6 to 8 months after campaign launch, and high levels of awareness were attained within the campaign’s two targeted audiences: susceptible nonsmokers (90.5%) and experimenters (94.6%). Most youth consider The Real Cost advertising to be effective, based on assessments of ad perceived effectiveness (mean = 4.0 on a scale from 1.0 to 5.0). High levels of awareness and positive ad reactions are requisite proximal indicators of health behavioral change. Additional research is being conducted to assess whether potential shifts in population-level cognitions and/or behaviors are attributable to this campaign. Current findings demonstrate that The Real Cost has attained high levels of ad awareness which is a critical first step in achieving positive changes in tobacco-related attitudes and behaviors. These data can also be used to inform ongoing message and media strategies for The Real Cost and other U.S. youth tobacco prevention campaigns."
https://openalex.org/W2220436936,"T2 relaxometry has become an important tool in quantitative MRI. Little focus has been put on the effect of the refocusing flip angle upon the offset parameter, which was introduced to account for a signal floor due to noise or to long T2 components. The aim of this study was to show that B1 imperfections contribute significantly to the offset. We further introduce a simple method to reduce the systematic error in T2 by discarding the first echo and using the offset fitting approach.Signal curves of T2 relaxometry were simulated based on extended phase graph theory and evaluated for 4 different methods (inclusion and exclusion of the first echo, while fitting with and without the offset). We further performed T2 relaxometry in a phantom at 9.4T magnetic resonance imaging scanner and used the same methods for post-processing as in the extended phase graph simulated data. Single spin echo sequences were used to determine the correct T2 time.The simulation data showed that the systematic error in T2 and the offset depends on the refocusing pulse, the echo spacing and the echo train length. The systematic error could be reduced by discarding the first echo. Further reduction of the systematic T2 error was reached by using the offset as fitting parameter. The phantom experiments confirmed these findings.The fitted offset parameter in T2 relaxometry is influenced by imperfect refocusing pulses. Using the offset as a fitting parameter and discarding the first echo is a fast and easy method to minimize the error in T2, particularly for low to intermediate echo train length."
https://openalex.org/W2205159064,"Background Representing approximately 0.5% of the population, transgender (trans) persons in Canada depend on family physicians for both general and transition-related care. However, physicians receive little to no training on this patient population, and trans patients are often profoundly uncomfortable and may avoid health care. This study examined factors associated with patient discomfort discussing trans health issues with a family physician in Ontario, Canada. Methods 433 trans people age 16 and over were surveyed using respondent-driven sampling for the Trans PULSE Project; 356 had a family physician. Weighted logistic regression models were fit to produce prevalence risk ratios (PRRs) via average marginal predictions, for transmasculine (n = 184) and transfeminine (n = 172) trans persons. Results Among the 83.1% (95% CI = 77.4, 88.9) of trans Ontarians who had a family physician, approximately half reported discomfort discussing trans health issues. 37.2% of transmasculine and 38.1% of transfeminine persons reported at least one trans-specific negative experience. In unadjusted analysis, sociodemographics did not predict discomfort, but those who planned to medically transition sex, but had not begun, were more likely to report discomfort (transmasculine: PRR = 2.62 (95% CI = 1.44, 4.77); transfeminine: PRR = 1.85 (95% CI = 1.08, 3.15)). Adjusted for other factors, greater perceived physician knowledge about trans issues was associated with reduced likelihood of discomfort, and previous trans-specific negative experiences with a family physician with increased discomfort. Transfeminine persons who reported three or more types of negative experiences were 2.26 times as likely, and transmasculine persons 1.61 times as likely, to report discomfort. In adjusted analyses, sociodemographic associations differed by gender, with being previously married or having higher education associated with increased risk of discomfort among transfeminine persons, but decreased risk among transmasculine persons. Conclusions Within this transgender population, discomfort in discussing trans health issues with a family physician was common, presenting a barrier to accessing primary care despite having a regular family physician and “universal” health insurance."
https://openalex.org/W1500209734,"A new topology optimization method called the Proportional Topology Optimization (PTO) is presented. As a non-sensitivity method, PTO is simple to understand, easy to implement, and is also efficient and accurate at the same time. It is implemented into two MATLAB programs to solve the stress constrained and minimum compliance problems. Descriptions of the algorithm and computer programs are provided in detail. The method is applied to solve three numerical examples for both types of problems. The method shows comparable efficiency and accuracy with an existing optimality criteria method which computes sensitivities. Also, the PTO stress constrained algorithm and minimum compliance algorithm are compared by feeding output from one algorithm to the other in an alternative manner, where the former yields lower maximum stress and volume fraction but higher compliance compared to the latter. Advantages and disadvantages of the proposed method and future works are discussed. The computer programs are self-contained and publicly shared in the website www.ptomethod.org."
https://openalex.org/W2205409324,"The mitochondrial permeability transition pore is a recognized drug target for neurodegenerative conditions such as multiple sclerosis and for ischemia-reperfusion injury in the brain and heart. The peptidylprolyl isomerase, cyclophilin D (CypD, PPIF), is a positive regulator of the pore, and genetic down-regulation or knock-out improves outcomes in disease models. Current inhibitors of peptidylprolyl isomerases show no selectivity between the tightly conserved cyclophilin paralogs and exhibit significant off-target effects, immunosuppression, and toxicity. We therefore designed and synthesized a new mitochondrially targeted CypD inhibitor, JW47, using a quinolinium cation tethered to cyclosporine. X-ray analysis was used to validate the design concept, and biological evaluation revealed selective cellular inhibition of CypD and the permeability transition pore with reduced cellular toxicity compared with cyclosporine. In an experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis disease model of neurodegeneration in multiple sclerosis, JW47 demonstrated significant protection of axons and improved motor assessments with minimal immunosuppression. These findings suggest that selective CypD inhibition may represent a viable therapeutic strategy for MS and identify quinolinium as a mitochondrial targeting group for in vivo use."
https://openalex.org/W2284461347,"Background This study aims to evaluate the dialectical relationship between equity and efficiency of health resource allocation and health service utilization in China. Methods We analyzed the inequity of health resource allocation and health service utilization based on concentration index (CI) and Gini coefficient. Data envelopment analysis (DEA) was used to evaluate the inefficiency of resource allocation and service utilization. Factor Analysis (FA) was used to determine input/output indicators. Results The CI of Health Institutions, Beds in Health Institutions, Health Professionals and Outpatient Visits were -0.116, -0.012, 0.038, and 0.111, respectively. Gini coefficient for the 31 provinces varied between 0.05 and 0.43; out of these 23 (742%) were observed to be technically efficient constituting the “best practice frontier”. The other 8 (25.8%) provinces were technically inefficient. Conclusions Health professionals and outpatient services are focused on higher income levels, while the Health Institutions and Beds in Health Institutions were concentrated on lower income levels. In China, a few provinces attained a basic balance in both equity and efficiency in terms of current health resource and service utilization, thus serving as a reference standard for other provinces."
https://openalex.org/W2213350922,"Most conservation decisions take place at national or finer spatial scales. Providing useful information at such decision-making scales is essential for guiding the practice of conservation. Brazil is one of the world's megadiverse countries, and consequently decisions about conservation in the country have a disproportionate impact on the survival of global biodiversity. For three groups of terrestrial vertebrates (birds, mammals, and amphibians), we examined geographic patterns of diversity and protection in Brazil, including that of endemic, small-ranged, and threatened species. To understand potential limitations of the data, we also explored how spatial bias in collection localities may influence the perceived patterns of diversity. The highest overall species richness is in the Amazon and Atlantic Forests, while the Atlantic Forest dominates in terms of country endemics and small-ranged species. Globally threatened species do not present a consistent pattern. Patterns for birds were similar to overall species richness, with higher concentrations of threatened species in the Atlantic Forest, while mammals show a more generalized pattern across the country and a high concentration in the Amazon. Few amphibians are listed as threatened, mostly in the Atlantic Forest. Data deficient mammals occur across the country, concentrating in the Amazon and southeast Atlantic Forest, and there are no data deficient birds in Brazil. In contrast, nearly a third of amphibians are data deficient, widespread across the country, but with a high concentration in the far southeast. Spatial biases in species locality data, however, possibly influence the perceived patterns of biodiversity. Regions with low sampling density need more biological studies, as do the many data deficient species. All biomes except the Amazon have less than 3% of their area under full protection. Reassuringly though, rates of protection do correlate with higher biodiversity, including higher levels of threatened and small-ranged species. Our results indicate a need for expanded formal protection in Brazil, especially in the Atlantic forest, and with an emphasis on fully protected areas."

Method 36 right-handed young healthy subjects participated in the study. The experimental task was an Italian version of Recognition Memory Test for unknown faces. Study included two experiments: in a first experiment, each subject underwent one session of sham tDCS and one session of left or right cathodal tDCS; in a second experiment each subject underwent one session of sham tDCS and one session of left or right anodal tDCS. Results Cathodal tDCS over the right DLPFC significantly improved non verbal recognition memory performance, while cathodal tDCS over the left DLPFC had no effect. Anodal tDCS of both the left and right DLPFC did not modify non verbal recognition memory performance. Conclusion Complementing the majority of previous studies, reporting long term memory facilitations following left prefrontal anodal tDCS, the present findings show that cathodal tDCS of the right DLPFC can also improve recognition memory in healthy subjects."

Furthermore, minichromosome maintenance complex component 10 (MCM10) was recently shown to be the natural substrate of the Cul4-DDB1[VprBP] E3 ubiquitin ligase (14Kaur M. Khan M. Kar A. Sharma A.

Shaykh-Baygloo N. Aghasadeghi M.R. Allahbakhshi E. HIV-1 Vpr protein enhances proteasomal degradation of MCM10 DNA replication factor through the Cul4-DDB1[VprBP] E3 ubiquitin ligase to induce G2/M cell cycle arrest.J. Biol. Chem. 2015; 290: 17380-17389Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). It is believed that Vpr induces most of its functions by interacting with VprBP. To investigate the biological roles of Vpr, we investigated proteins that interact with VprBP. It was recently shown that VprBP directly interacts with nucleosomes by recognizing the unacetylated N-terminal tail of histone H3 (15Kim K. Heo K. Choi J. Jackson S. Kim H. Xiong Y. An W. Vpr-binding protein antagonizes p53-mediated transcription via direct interaction with H3 tail.Mol. Cell Biol. 2012; 32: 783-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In this complex, VprBP was also shown to bind histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1). HDACs are a class of enzymes that remove acetyl groups from ϵ-N-acetyl lysine amino-acids of histones and other proteins and also regulate a number of key cellular processes, including gene expression, protein complex formation, and protein stability and localization (16Gallinari P.

There is a high level of homology among the members of class I HDACs, which comprises HDAC1, 2, 3, and 8. Class I HDACs localize to the nucleus, except for HDAC3, which can be found both in the cytoplasm and the nucleus (22Delcuve G.P. Khan D.H. Davie J.R.

In this study, we found that Vpr binds and depletes chromatin-associated class I HDACs, enabling the virus to overcome latent infection in primary macrophages. HEK293T and HeLa cells were obtained from ATCC. TZM-bl cells were obtained from the NIH AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program. Doxycycline-inducible HeLa cell lines (HeLa-iFlag-Vpr, HeLa-iFlag-Q65R) and the control cell line (HeLa-iMock) were described previously (10Romani B. Shaykh-Baygloo N. Aghasadeghi M.R.

HeLa and the inducible HeLa cell lines were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml of streptomycin. To isolate monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs), hepatitis B virus and HIV-1-seronegative adult donors that had signed a consent form, provided peripheral blood samples. PBMCs were isolated from whole blood using Ficoll-density gradient centrifugation. Monocytes were primarily isolated by plastic adherence. For differentiation into mature macrophages, monocytes were cultured in RPMI supplemented with 50 ng/ml macrophage-colony stimulating factor M-CSF, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 10% FBS. After 7 days, cells were washed with PBS to rinse off the nonadherent cells. Purity of MDMs was verified by flow cytometry using antibodies against CD14 and CD16. HDAC1 (ab7028), HDAC2 (ab7029), HDAC3 (ab32369), HDAC8 (ab18968), histone H3 (ab70550), DDB1 (ab124672), p24 (ab9071), SIRT3 (ab86671), and HDAC4 (ab11968) antibodies were purchased from Abcam.

To generate an expression vector for HIV-1 Vpr, the vpr gene of HIV Gag-iGFP was cloned into pcDNA3.1. pRK5-HA-Ubiquitin-WT, pcDNA3.1-HDAC1-Flag,and pcDNA3.1-HDAC3-Flag were obtained from Addgene. pNL(AD8), pNL4–3-deltaE-EGFP, and pNL4.3.Luc.Env- were obtained from the NIH AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program. The R5-tropic clone of HIV-1, pNL4.3.AD8. IRES_GFP_Nef-, was generated by cutting a 1.7-kbp fragment between the Kpnl and Bsml site in the envelope coding region from the R5-tropic clone pNL(AD8) and replacing this fragment for the corresponding region of pNL4.3_IRES_GFP_Nef-. The ΔVpr, Q65R, and R80A mutants were generated in the viral constructs using site-directed mutagenesis. All viral and lentiviral vectors were produced in HEK293T cells using the standard calcium phosphate transfection method. Viral and lentiviral particles were collected 48 h and 72 h post-transfection by ultracentrifugation at 35000 rpm for 2 h. Briefly, lentiviral vectors were produced by cotransfection of pWPI, pWPI-Flag-Vpr, pWPI-Flag-Vpr(Q65R), pWPI-Flag-Vpr(R80A), and pWPI-Flag-Vpx and the packaging plasmids, pCMV-VSV-G and psPax2. Lentiviral vectors were titrated in HEK293T cells using GFP signal. The VSV-G-pseudotyped pNL4.3.Luc.Env-(WT/ΔVpr) and pNL4–3-deltaE-EGFP (WT/ΔVpr/Q65R/R80A) were produced by cotransfection of the proviral plasmids with pCMV-VSV-G. pNL4.3.AD8. IRES_GFP_Nef- and its mutants (ΔVpr/Q65R/R80A) were produced by transfection of the proviral plasmids in HEK293T cells. pNL4.3.Luc.Env-(WT/ΔVpr) and pNL4.3.AD8. IRES_GFP_Nef- derived viruses were titrated in TZM-bl cells. p24 of the concentrated viral stock for pNL4–3-deltaE-EGFP (WT/ΔVpr/Q65R/R80A) was titrated using ELISA. HeLa cells were transduced with lentiviral vectors at an MOI of 2.0. Primary MDMs were infected at an MOI of 1.0 with fully replicative viruses or with 1 ng of p24 per 105 cells when infecting with single cycle VSV-G pseudotyped viruses. VprBP, HDAC1, HDAC3 and nontargeting siRNAs were transfected into inducible HeLa cell lines and/or primary MDMs using Lipofectamine RNAiMax Reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions. In order to fractionate HeLa and inducible HeLa cell lines, cells were lysed in 1 ml of 0.5% Triton lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Triton, and protease inhibitor mixture). Cells were incubated for 10 min with mild agitation at 4 °C and then centrifuged at 6000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C to pellet chromatin and other large insoluble debris. Supernatant was collected as the soluble fraction, and the pellet was resuspended in 2 ml of Benzonase buffer (50 mm Tris pH 8, 150 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mg/ml BSA, and protease inhibitor mixture). The resuspended pellet was centrifuged and supernatant was discarded. 1 μl of Benzonase enzyme (25 units/μl) was added to 1 ml of Benzonase buffer and this was used to resuspend the pellet and incubate it on ice for 60 min. The Benzonase-treated pellet was centrifuged at 13000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. Supernatant was collected as the fraction containing chromatin-bound proteins. Purity of the fractions was confirmed by the presence of GAPDH in soluble protein fraction and histone H3 in chromatin-bound protein fraction. Anti-Flag and anti-HA immunoprecipitations were performed using 40 μl of commercial antibodies conjugated to agarose beads. For anti-VprBP, HDAC1, HDAC2, HDAC3, and HDAC8 immunoprecipitations, antibodies (2 μg per immunoprecipitation) were incubated overnight at 4 °C with 50 μl of protein A-Sepharose beads in 1 ml of PBS supplemented with 5% FBS. All the immunoprecipitations were performed in the presence of 150 mm NaCl and 0.5% Triton X-100 for 2 h at 4 °C. For VprBP pull-down, 25 μg/ml ethidium bromide was also added to the solution to avoid the nonspecific pull-down of chromatin-bound proteins through DNA bridges. After thorough washes in 0.5% Triton lysis buffer, the anti-Flag immunoprecipitated proteins were eluted by adding 100 μg/ml Flag peptides. Immunoprecipitations using protein A-Sepharose beads and monoclonal anti-HA-agarose beads were released by treating the beads with 0.1 m glycine, pH 2.0, for 10 min on ice. Immunoprecipitated proteins and cellular fractions (30 μg) were resuspended in Laemmli buffer, heat-denatured for 5 min, and separated on 12% SDS-PAGE gels. Western blots were performed as described previously (10Romani B. Shaykh-Baygloo N. Aghasadeghi M.R. Allahbakhshi E. HIV-1 Vpr protein enhances proteasomal degradation of MCM10 DNA replication factor through the Cul4-DDB1[VprBP] E3 ubiquitin ligase to induce G2/M cell cycle arrest.J. Biol. Chem. 2015; 290: 17380-17389Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Supernatants of the infected cells were collected, inactivated with Triton X-100 (1% final concentration), and stored at −80 °C until analyzed. Levels of HIV-1 p24 were determined using HIV-1 p24 Antigen Capture assay (ABL Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Primary MDMs were infected at an MOI of 1.0 with single cycle VSV-G pseudotyped pNL4.3.Luc.Env-(WT/ΔVpr) that expresses luciferase in the infected cells. Seven days after infection, cells were washed with PBS and lysed directly in the tissue culture plates using Triton X-100 (1% final concentration). Luciferase was measured in the cell lysates using luciferase assay system (Promega). To analyze enrichment of class I HDACs and acetylated histones on the HIV-1 LTR, 5 × 105 MDMs were infected with pNL4.3.AD8. IRES_GFP_Nef- (WT and ΔVpr) at an MOI of 1.0. After 7 days, cells were looked under a fluorescent microscope for GFP-positive infected cells. If percentage of the infected cells was higher than 5%, we proceeded with the experiment. Cells were then fixed with 0.5% formaldehyde. After 5 min, fixation was quenched by adding glycine to a final concentration of 125 mm for 5 min and cells were then washed with PBS and harvested. Cells were lysed in TpA (0.25% Triton, 10 mm Tris pH8, 10 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm EGTA, protease inhibitor) for 5 min on ice and centrifuged. This would disrupt the cellular membrane and release the non-integrated proviruses. Cell nuclei were then washed with TpB (200 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris, pH 8, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm EGTA, protease inhibitor) and lysed in TpS (0.5% SDS, 0.5% Triton, 10 mm Tris pH8, 140 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm EGTA, protease inhibitor). Chromatin was sheared using Bioruptor XL sonicator (Diagenode) to obtain DNA fragments ranging from 200 to 800 bps. For each immunoprecipitation, 2 μg of antibody was conjugated to 10 μl of protein A and protein G Dynabeads (1:1 ratio) by overnight incubation of the beads/antibody in 500 μl of ChIP dilution buffer (1% Triton, 10 mm Tris, pH 8, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA) at 4 °C. ChIPs were performed by adding the sonicated DNA to the antibody-conjugated Dynabeads and incubation at 4 °C for 4 h. Following extensive washes, the DNA of ChIP samples and nonimmunoprecipitated chromatin (input) were decross-linked in TpE (0.3% SDS, 50 mm Tris, pH 8, 10 mm EDTA, 0.4 m NaCl) by overnight incubation at 65 °C and extracted using the standard phenol-chloroform method. The DNA was then subjected to quantitative PCR. Occupancy of HIV-1 genome by class I HDACs and acetylated histones was analyzed using quantitative PCR. Briefly, the DNA that was pulled down using ChIP and the corresponding input DNA was subjected to PCR using the following primers: nuc-0-F 5′-CCACACACAAGGCTACTTCCCT-3′, nuc-0-R 5′-CAACTGGTACTAACTTGAAGCA-3′, nuc-1-F 5′-GTCTCTCTGGTTAGACCAGA-3′, nuc-1-R 5′-TACTTTGAGCACTCAAGGCA-3′, nuc-2-F 5′-AAAAATTTTGACTAGCGGAGGCT-3′, nuc-2-R 5′-CTTAACCGAATTTTTTCCCA-3′, ChIP-GAPDH-F 5′-CCTTCCCCTAGTCCCCAGAA-3′, ChIP-GAPDH-R 5′-AGCGCGAAAGGAAAGAAAGC-3′. A pair of primers were also designed against an intergenic region (gene accession number: AF254641.1), where no hyperacetylation of histones is expected, as follow: INT-F 5′-GTAGAGGAAGCGATCTGGGA-3′, INT-R 5′-CAAGGCCACTCTCGGCCTCT-3′. Amplification of the target sequences was detected using SYBR Select Master Mix, and the CT values were normalized to the inputs and the intergenic region. To assess whether Vpr affects class I HDACs at transcription level, HeLa-iFlag-Vpr and HeLa-iMock were induced by adding 1 μg/ml doxycycline. After 30 h, cells were harvested, and total RNA was extracted from 106 cells using RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Using SuperScript II Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen) and oligo(dT)12–18 Primers (Invitrogen), RNA was reverse transcribed into cDNA. The cDNA was diluted 100-fold with DNase-free water. Quantitative PCR was performed on the diluted cDNA using SYBR Select Master Mix. Primers used in qPCR include: HDAC1-F 5′-TACGACGGGGATGTTGGAAA-3′, HDAC1-R 5′-ATTGGCTTTGTGAGGGCGAT-3′, HDAC2-F 5′-CCATGGCGTACAGTCAAGGA-3′, HDAC2-R 5′-TCATTTCTTCGGCAGTGGCT-3′, HDAC3-F 5′-TCTTTGAGTTCTGCTCGCGT-3′, HDAC3-R 5′-GCCAGAGGCCTCAAACTTCT-3′, HDAC8-F 5′-TCTCCAGAAGGTCAGCCAAGA-3′, HDAC8-R 5′-TCTTTGCATGATGCCACCCT-3′, GAPDH-F 5′-GAGAAGGCTGGGGCTCATTT-3′, GAPDH-R 5′-GCAGTGATGGCATGGACTGT-3′. Data were normalized to GAPDH and calculated using the 2−(ΔΔCT) method. To analyze expression levels of HIV-1 mRNA in infected MDMs, total mRNA was extracted using Ultrasens Viral RNA kit (Qiagen) and reverse transcribed using SuperScript II Reverse Transcriptase and oligo(dT)12–18 Primers. cDNA was then subjected to quantitative PCR using nuc-2-F and nuc-2-R primers. To compare integration of HIV-1 provirus in the presence or absence of Vpr, genome of infected MDMs was analyzed using Alu-PCR. Briefly, primary MDMs were infected with the single cycle VSV-G pseudotyped pNL4.3Env-.IRES.GFP WT and ΔVpr viruses. Four days post-infection, GFP-positive and -negative cells were sorted and the genomic DNA was extracted from 20,000 sorted and unsorted cells using DNeasy Blood & Tissue Kit (QIAGen). DNA was amplified using the forward primer Alu-F 5′-GCCTCCCAAAGTGCTGGGATTACAG-3′ that binds human Alu gene and the reverse primer HIV-LTR-outer-R 5′-TGCTAGAGATTTTCCACACTGA-3′ that binds HIV-1 LTR. One microliter of the amplified DNA was used for qPCR using HIV-LTR-F 5′-CTGGCTAACTAGGGAACCCACT-3′ and HIV-LTR-inner-R 5′-CTCAATAAAGCTTGCCTTGAGTGCTC-3′ primers. To amplify the total HIV-1 provirus (integrated and non-integrated), DNA was amplified using HIV-LTR-F and HIV-LTR-inner-R. Amplification of a specific region on HIV-1 LTR was detected using the probe LTR-Probe 5′-(FAM)-CTCAATAAAGCTTGCCTTGAGTGCTC-(TAMRA)-3′. Results of Alu-PCR were normalized to the total HIV-1 provirus. To analyze the cell cycle profile of inducible HeLa cell lines, they were induced by adding doxycycline and after 30 h their DNA content was labeled by propidium iodide staining and cells were analyzed as previously described (10Romani B. Shaykh-Baygloo N. Aghasadeghi M.R. Allahbakhshi E. HIV-1 Vpr protein enhances proteasomal degradation of MCM10 DNA replication factor through the Cul4-DDB1[VprBP] E3 ubiquitin ligase to induce G2/M cell cycle arrest.J. Biol. Chem. 2015; 290: 17380-17389Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). To examine purity and differentiation of MDMs, their surface markers were labeled using CD14 Mouse Anti-Human mAb, PE-Texas Red conjugate and APC/Cy7 anti-human CD16 for 30 min on ice. Cells were washed three times and analyzed using flow cytometry. To analyze infectivity of the single cycle HIV-1 in MDMs, they were infected with VSV-G-pseudotyped NL4–3-deltaE-EGFP (WT, ΔVpr, Q65R, and R80A). Four days post-infection, MDMs were analyzed for expression of GFP. All the analyses were performed using CyAn ADP Analyzer. To analyze acute versus latent infections, primary MDMs were infected with single cycle VSV-G pseudotyped GFP reporter WT/ΔVpr viruses for 4 days. The GFP-positive and -negative cells were sorted in PBS using an Influx cell sorter (BD Biosciences) and analyzed using Alu-PCR or Western blot. To analyze viral expression in macrophages, primary MDMs were infected with GFP reporter WT/ΔVpr viruses for 7 days. The GFP-positive cells were then sorted using an Influx cell sorter (BD Biosciences) and analyzed using Western blot. Student's t test or Analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Bonferroni's multiple comparison test was used for statistical analysis using GraphPad Prism 6.0. A value of p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results were expressed as mean ± S.E.M. or mean ± S.D., and represent data from a minimum of three independent experiments unless otherwise stated. Since VprBP was reported to interact with HDAC1 on chromatin, we developed a fractionation method to examine the impact of Vpr on this interaction in a localized manner. Our fractions included soluble and chromatin-bound protein fractions, in which the soluble fraction contained both cytoplasmic proteins and soluble nuclear proteins, while the chromatin-bound protein fraction contained nuclear proteins released by treatment of the chromatin pellet with Benzonase DNase. A doxycycline-inducible cell line, HeLa-iFlag-Vpr cells, was used as previously described (10Romani B. Shaykh-Baygloo N. Aghasadeghi M.R. Allahbakhshi E. HIV-1 Vpr protein enhances proteasomal degradation of MCM10 DNA replication factor through the Cul4-DDB1[VprBP] E3 ubiquitin ligase to induce G2/M cell cycle arrest.J. Biol. Chem. 2015; 290: 17380-17389Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Expression of Flag-tagged HIV-1 Vpr was induced by adding doxycycline to HeLa-iFlag-Vpr cells and the quantities of class I HDACs were monitored in a time course experiment (Fig. 1A). A significant depletion of HDAC1 was found after 10 h in chromatin fraction followed by its depletion in the soluble fraction only after 30 h. Depletion of HDAC2 was only found significant in chromatin fraction 30 h post-induction with no significant depletion in the soluble fraction. Depletion of HDAC3 was initiated as early as 5 h post-induction in the chromatin fraction and then followed by its depletion in the soluble fraction 20 h post-induction. Depletion of HDAC8, which was only found in chromatin fraction, appeared significant after 20 h. Our results indicated that depletion of class I HDACs was more drastic on chromatin as the chromatin associated class I HDACs were depleted before the soluble class I HDACs. Chromatin depletion of HDAC3 was found to occur before other HDACs, suggesting more sensitivity of HDAC3 to expression of Vpr while HDAC2 was found the least sensitive member of class I HDACs. Expression of Vpr did not seem to affect the mRNA levels of class I HDACs (Fig. 1B) suggesting the down-regulation of HDACs occurs at protein level.

https://openalex.org/W2126904712,"This paper explores bias in the estimation of sampling variance in Respondent Driven Sampling (RDS). Prior methodological work on RDS has focused on its problematic assumptions and the biases and inefficiencies of its estimators of the population mean. Nonetheless, researchers have given only slight attention to the topic of estimating sampling variance in RDS, despite the importance of variance estimation for the construction of confidence intervals and hypothesis tests. In this paper, we show that the estimators of RDS sampling variance rely on a critical assumption that the network is First Order Markov (FOM) with respect to the dependent variable of interest. We demonstrate, through intuitive examples, mathematical generalizations, and computational experiments that current RDS variance estimators will always underestimate the population sampling variance of RDS in empirical networks that do not conform to the FOM assumption. Analysis of 215 observed university and school networks from Facebook and Add Health indicates that the FOM assumption is violated in every empirical network we analyze, and that these violations lead to substantially biased RDS estimators of sampling variance. We propose and test two alternative variance estimators that show some promise for reducing biases, but which also illustrate the limits of estimating sampling variance with only partial information on the underlying population social network."

The CuNPs were electrochemically deposited on to the graphene sheets to improve electron transfer rates and to enhance electrocatalytic activity toward glucose. The graphene based electrode with CuNPs demonstrated a high degree of sensitivity (1101.3 ± 56 μA/mM.cm2), excellent selectivity (without an interference with Ascorbic Acid, Uric Acid, Dopamine, and Acetaminophen), good stability with a linear response to glucose ranging from 0.1 mM to 0.6 mM concentration, and detection limits of 0.025 mM to 0.9 mM. Characterization of the electrodes was performed by scanning electron microscopy (FESEM and SEM). The electrochemical properties of the modified graphene electrodes were inspected by cyclic voltammetry (CV), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), and amperometry."

Elucidation of the molecular mechanisms associated with AQP5-mediated, migration of endometrial cells may contribute to a better understanding of endometriosis. Our objectives included identifying the estrogen-response element (ERE) in the promoter region of the AQP5 gene, and, investigating the effects of AQP5 on ectopic implantation of endometrial cells. Luciferase reporter assays and electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) identified the ERE-like motif in the promoter region of the AQP5 gene. After blocking and up-regulating estradiol (E2) levels, we analysed the expression of AQP5 in endometrial stromal (ES) cells. After blocking E2 /or phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase(PI3K), we analysed the role of AQP5 in signaling pathways. We constructed an AQP5, shRNA, lentiviral vector to knock out the AQP5 gene in ES cells. After knock-out of the AQP5 gene, we studied the role of AQP5 in cell invasion, proliferation, and the formation of ectopic endometrial implants in female mice. We identified an estrogen-response element in the promoter region of the AQP5 gene. Estradiol (E2) increased AQP5 expression in a dose-dependent fashion, that was blocked by ICI182,780(an estrogen receptor inhibitor). E2 activated PI3K /protein kinase B(AKT) pathway (PI3K/AKT), that, in turn, increased AQP5 expression. LY294002(PI3K inhibitor) attenuated estrogen-enhanced, AQP5 expression. Knock-out of the AQP5 gene with AQP5 shRNA lentiviral vector significantly inhibited E2-enhanced invasion, proliferation of ES cells and formation of ectopic implants. Estrogen induces AQP5 expression by activating ERE in the promoter region of the AQP5gene, activates the PI3K/AKT pathway, and, promotes endometrial cell invasion and proliferation. These results provide new insights into some of the mechanisms that may underpin the development of deposits of ectopic endometrium."
https://openalex.org/W2296995368,"Information about lipid content and fatty acid (FA) composition of muskoxen (Ovibos moschatos) edible tissues is very limited in comparison to other meat sources. Thus, this work aims to present the first in-depth characterization of the FA profile of meat, subcutaneous adipose tissue and liver of muskoxen living in West Greenland. Furthermore, we aim to evaluate the effect of sex in the FA composition of these edible tissues. Samples from muscle (Longissimus dorsi), subcutaneous adipose tissue and liver were collected from female and male muskoxen, which were delivered at the butchery in Kangerlussuaq (West Greenland) during the winter hunting season. The lipid content of muscle, adipose tissue and liver averaged 284, 846 and 173 mg/g of dry tissue, respectively. This large lipid contents confirms that in late winter, when forage availability is scarce, muskoxen from West Greenland still have high fat reserves, demonstrating that they are well adapted to seasonal feed restriction. A detailed characterization of FA and dimethylacetal composition of muskoxen muscle, subcutaneous adipose tissue and liver showed that there are little differences on FA composition between sexes. Nevertheless, the 18:1cis-9 was the most abundant FA in muscle and adipose tissue, reaching 43% of total FA in muscle. The high content of 18:1cis-9 suggests that it can be selectively stored in muskoxen tissues. Regarding the nutritional composition of muskoxen edible tissues, they are not a good source of polyunsaturated FA; however, they may contribute to a higher fat intake. Information about the FA composition of muskoxen meat and liver is scarce, so this work can contribute to the characterization of the nutritional fat properties of muskoxen edible tissues and can be also useful to update food composition databases."

The aim of this study was to determine the safety and efficacy of the routine administration of 6 grams/day of intravenous paracetamol in reducing body temperature following severe traumatic brain injury, compared to placebo.A multicentre, randomised, blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial in adult patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI). Patients were randomised to receive an intravenous infusion of either 1g of paracetamol or 0.9% sodium chloride (saline) every 4 hours for 72 hours. The primary outcome was the mean difference in core temperature during the study intervention period.Forty-one patients were included in this study: 21 were allocated to paracetamol and 20 to saline. The median (interquartile range) number of doses of study drug was 18 (17-18) in the paracetamol group and 18 (16-18) in the saline group (P = 0.85). From randomisation until 4 hours after the last dose of study treatment, there were 2798 temperature measurements (median 73 [67-76] per patient). The mean ± standard deviation temperature was 37.4±0.5°C in the paracetamol group and 37.7±0.4°C in the saline group (absolute difference -0.3°C; 95% confidence interval -0.6 to 0.0; P = 0.09).

This study identifies a mechanism that can cause overconfidence and demonstrates a simple, effective countermeasure in an incentive-compatible experimental study. We observed that joy induced overconfidence if the reason for joy (an unexpected gift) was unrelated to the judgment task and if participants were not made specifically aware of this mood manipulation. In contrast, we observed well-calibrated judgments among participants in a control group who were in their resting mood. Furthermore, we found well-calibrated judgments among participants who received the joyful mood induction together with questions that forced them to reflect on their current mood and the (ir)relevance of its cause to our judgment tasks. Our findings suggest that being aware of one's positive mood and the reason for that mood may effectively reduce overconfidence for a short period."

https://openalex.org/W2275493451,"The role of PD-1 expression on CD4 T cells during HIV infection is not well understood. Here, we describe the differential expression of PD-1 in CD127high CD4 T cells within the early/intermediate differentiated (EI) (CD27highCD45RAlow) T cell population among uninfected and HIV-infected subjects, with higher expression associated with decreased viral replication (HIV-1 viral load). A significant loss of circulating PD-1highCTLA-4low CD4 T cells was found specifically in the CD127highCD27highCD45RAlow compartment, while initiation of antiretroviral treatment, particularly in subjects with advanced disease, reversed these dynamics. Increased HIV-1 Gag DNA was also found in PD-1high compared to PD-1low ED CD4 T cells. In line with an increased susceptibility to HIV infection, PD-1 expression in this CD4 T cell subset was associated with increased activation and expression of the HIV co-receptor, CCR5. Rather than exhaustion, this population produced more IFN-g, MIP1-a, IL-4, IL-10, and IL-17a compared to PD-1low EI CD4 T cells. In line with our previous findings, PD-1high EI CD4 T cells were also characterized by a high expression of CCR7, CXCR5 and CCR6, a phenotype associated with increased in vitro B cell help. Our data show that expression of PD-1 on early-differentiated CD4 T cells may represent a population that is highly functional, more susceptible to HIV infection and selectively lost in chronic HIV infection."
https://openalex.org/W2204233444,"Captive breeding of endangered species often aims at preserving genetic diversity and to avoid the harmful effects of inbreeding. However, deleterious alleles causing inbreeding depression can be purged when inbreeding persists over several generations. Despite its great importance both for evolutionary biology and for captive breeding programmes, few studies have addressed whether and to which extent purging may occur. Here we undertake a longitudinal study with the largest captive population of Cuvier's gazelle managed under a European Endangered Species Programme since 1975. Previous results in this population have shown that highly inbred mothers tend to produce more daughters, and this fact was used in 2006 to reach a more appropriate sex-ratio in this polygynous species by changing the pairing strategy (i.e., pairing some inbred females instead of keeping them as surplus individuals in the population). Here, by using studbook data we explore whether purging has occurred in the population by investigating whether after the change in pairing strategy a) inbreeding and homozygosity increased at the population level, b) fitness (survival) increased, and c) the relationship between inbreeding and juvenile survival, was positive. Consistent with the existence of purging, we found an increase in inbreeding coefficients, homozygosity and juvenile survival. In addition, we showed that in the course of the breeding programme the relationship between inbreeding and juvenile survival was not uniform but rather changed over time: it was negative in the early years, flat in the middle years and positive after the change in pairing strategy. We highlight that by allowing inbred individuals to mate in captive stocks we may favour sex-ratio bias towards females, a desirable managing strategy to reduce the surplus of males that force most zoos to use ethical culling and euthanizing management tools. We discuss these possibilities but also acknowledge that many other effects should be considered before implementing inbreeding and purging as elements in management decisions."
https://openalex.org/W2411543263,"Several studies have reported that low vitamin D levels are associated with an increased risk of developing multiple sclerosis (MS). As MS is an inflammatory disorder with degeneration of axons and neurons, we examined whether the biologically active form of vitamin D, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25D3), could protect against the T cell-mediated killing of human neurons in culture, and the axonal loss seen in mice with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). Human neurons were exposed to activated human T lymphocytes and the loss of neurons was documented 24 hours later by counting the number of microtubule-associated protein-2 positive cells. Mice with EAE were harvested for counts of axonal profiles in the spinal cord. 1,25D3 was exposed to T cells in culture or administered to mice from peak EAE clinical severity when axonal loss was already evolving. Activated T lymphocytes killed human neurons prominently within 24 hours but toxicity was significantly attenuated when T cells were exposed to 1,25D3 prior to the co-culture. In EAE, 1,25D3 treatment initiated from peak clinical severity reduced the extent of clinical disability and mitigated the progressive loss of axons. The reduction of axonal and neuronal loss by 1,25D3 in the context of an inflammatory assault to the central nervous system is a potential contributor to the putative benefits of vitamin D in MS."
https://openalex.org/W2212247903,"Proportional mortality ratio data indicate that healthcare workers (HCWs) have an elevated tuberculosis (TB) mortality. Whether this is caused by an increased TB incidence, a worse TB treatment outcome, or a combination of effects, remains unclear. To elucidate the hazard components of occupational TB, we assessed TB incidence and TB treatment outcome among HCWs in Taiwan.We compared the incidence of active TB among HCWs at a major medical center in Taiwan with that of Taiwan general population in 2004-2012. We also compared the TB treatment outcome of HCWs with that of age/sex-matched non-HCW patients treated at the same hospital, as well as that of nationally registered TB patients.The standardized TB incidence ratio of the HCWs was 1.9 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.2-2.9), compared with the general population. HCWs with pulmonary TB (n = 30) were less likely to have underlying diseases, delay in diagnosis, delay in treatment, or side effects of treatment, compared with age/sex-matched non-HCW TB patients (n = 120) (all Ps<0.05). The TB treatment outcome of HCWs was significantly better than that of non-HCW patients (TB-related mortality: 0.0% vs. 5.8%, P = 0.008, Mantel-Haenszel test). The standardized TB-related mortality rate was 1.08% [95% CI: 0.96% - 1.20%] for all of the nationally registered TB patients in Taiwan.HCWs are at increased risk of active TB, compared with general population. To mitigate this occupational hazard, more efforts need to be directed towards the prevention of nosocomial TB transmission. Healthy worker effect, more rapid diagnosis, and less delay in treatment contribute to a lower TB-related mortality in HCWs."
https://openalex.org/W2286918083,"Background Recently cardiomyocyte progenitor cells (CMPCs) were successfully isolated from fetal and adult human hearts. Direct intramyocardial injection of human CMPCs (hCMPCs) in experimental mouse models of acute myocardial infarction significantly improved cardiac function compared to controls. Aim Here, our aim was to investigate whether xenotransplantation via intracoronary infusion of fetal hCMPCs in a pig model of chronic myocardial infarction is safe and efficacious, in view of translation purposes. Methods & Results We performed a randomized, blinded, placebo controlled trial. Four weeks after ischemia/reperfusion injury by 90 minutes of percutaneous left anterior descending artery occlusion, pigs (n = 16, 68.5 ± 5.4 kg) received intracoronary infusion of 10 million fetal hCMPCs or placebo. All animals were immunosuppressed by cyclosporin (CsA). Four weeks after infusion, endpoint analysis by MRI displayed no difference in left ventricular ejection fraction, left ventricular end diastolic and left ventricular end systolic volumes between both groups. Serial pressure volume (PV-)loop and echocardiography showed no differences in functional parameters between groups at any timepoint. Infarct size at follow-up, measured by late gadolinium enhancement MRI showed no difference between groups. Intracoronary pressure and flow measurements showed no signs of coronary obstruction 30 minutes after cell infusion. No premature death occurred in cell treated animals. Conclusion Xenotransplantation via intracoronary infusion of hCMPCs is feasible and safe, but not associated with improved left ventricular performance and infarct size compared to placebo in a porcine model of chronic myocardial infarction."

Yet, major gaps in the fossil record and uncertainties surrounding the age of key fossils have meant that these questions remain poorly understood. Here we describe and compare a highly unusual femur from Late Pleistocene sediments at Maludong (Yunnan), Southwest China, recovered along with cranial remains that exhibit a mixture of anatomically modern human and archaic traits. Our studies show that the Maludong femur has affinities to archaic hominins, especially Lower Pleistocene femora. However, the scarcity of later Middle and Late Pleistocene archaic remains in East Asia makes an assessment of systematically relevant character states difficult, warranting caution in assigning the specimen to a species at this time. The Maludong fossil probably samples an archaic population that survived until around 14,000 years ago in the biogeographically complex region of Southwest China."
https://openalex.org/W2208175172,"As an innate defense mechanism, macrophages produce reactive oxygen species that weaken pathogens and serve as secondary messengers involved in immune function. The Gram-negative bacterium Francisella tularensis utilizes its antioxidant armature to limit the host immune response, but the mechanism behind this suppression is not defined. Here we establish that F. tularensis limits Ca2+ entry in macrophages, thereby limiting actin reorganization and IL-6 production in a redox-dependent fashion. Wild type (live vaccine strain) or catalase-deficient F. tularensis (ΔkatG) show distinct profiles in their H2O2 scavenging rates, 1 and 0.015 pm/s, respectively. Murine alveolar macrophages infected with ΔkatG display abnormally high basal intracellular Ca2+ concentration that did not increase further in response to H2O2. Additionally, ΔkatG-infected macrophages displayed limited Ca2+ influx in response to ionomycin, as a result of ionophore H2O2 sensitivity. Exogenously added H2O2 or H2O2 generated by ΔkatG likely oxidizes ionomycin and alters its ability to transport Ca2+. Basal increases in cytosolic Ca2+ and insensitivity to H2O2-mediated Ca2+ entry in ΔkatG-infected cells are reversed by the Ca2+ channel inhibitors 2-aminoethyl diphenylborinate and SKF-96365. 2-Aminoethyl diphenylborinate but not SKF-96365 abrogated ΔkatG-dependent increases in macrophage actin remodeling and IL-6 secretion, suggesting a role for H2O2-mediated Ca2+ entry through the transient receptor potential melastatin 2 (TRPM2) channel in macrophages. Indeed, increases in basal Ca2+, actin polymerization, and IL-6 production are reversed in TRPM2-null macrophages infected with ΔkatG. Together, our findings provide compelling evidence that F. tularensis catalase restricts reactive oxygen species to temper macrophage TRPM2-mediated Ca2+ signaling and limit host immune function."

Binding of IFNs to its receptors, IFNAR1 and IFNAR2, is leading to activation of the IFN response. To determine whether structural perturbations observed during binding are propagated to the cytoplasmic domain, multiple mutations were introduced into the transmembrane helix and its surroundings. Insertion of one to five alanine residues near either the N or C terminus of the transmembrane domain (TMD) likely promotes a rotation of 100° and a translation of 1.5 Å per added residue. Surprisingly, the added alanines had little effect on the binding affinity of IFN to the cell surface receptors, STAT phosphorylation, or gene induction. Similarly, substitution of the juxtamembrane residues of the TMD with alanines, or replacement of the TMD of IFNAR1 with that of IFNAR2, did not affect IFN binding or activity. Finally, only the addition of 10 serine residues (but not 2 or 4) between the extracellular domain of IFNAR1 and the TMD had some effect on signaling. Bioinformatic analysis shows a correlation between high sequence conservation of TMDs of cytokine receptors and the ability to transmit structural signals. Sequence conservation near the TMD of IFNAR1 is low, suggesting limited functional importance for this region. Our results suggest that IFN binding to the extracellular domains of IFNAR1 and IFNAR2 promotes proximity between the intracellular domains and that differential signaling is a function of duration of activation and affinity of binding rather than specific conformational changes transmitted from the outside to the inside of the cell.

https://openalex.org/W2203141938,"The relative increase in Aβ42 peptides from familial Alzheimer disease (FAD) linked APP and PSEN mutations can be related to changes in both ε-cleavage site utilization and subsequent step-wise cleavage. Cleavage at the ε-site releases the amyloid precursor protein (APP) intracellular domain (AICD), and perturbations in the position of ε-cleavage are closely associated with changes in the profile of amyloid β-protein (Aβ) species that are produced and secreted. The mechanisms by which γ-secretase modulators (GSMs) or FAD mutations affect the various γ-secretase cleavages to alter the generation of Aβ peptides have not been fully elucidated. Recent studies suggested that GSMs do not modulate ε-cleavage of APP, but the data were derived principally from recombinant truncated epitope tagged APP substrate. Here, using full length APP from transfected cells, we investigated whether GSMs modify the ε-cleavage of APP under more native conditions. Our results confirmed the previous findings that ε-cleavage is insensitive to GSMs. In addition, fenofibrate, an inverse GSM (iGSM), did not alter the position or kinetics of ε-cleavage position in vitro. APH1A and APH1B, a subunit of the γ-secretase complex, also modulated Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio without any alterations in ε-cleavage, a result in contrast to what has been observed with PS1 and APP FAD mutations. Consequently, GSMs and APH1 appear to modulate γ-secretase activity and Aβ42 generation by altering processivity but not ε-cleavage site utilization."

However, the overall burden of influenza in this context is poorly defined and incidence data for African countries are scarce. We therefore studied the fever syndrome incidence and more specifically influenza incidence in a cohort of inhabitants of Dielmo and Ndiop in Sokone district, Senegal.Daily febrile-illness data were prospectively obtained from January 2012 to December 2013 from the cohort of the villages of Dielmo and Ndiop, initially dedicated to the study of malaria. Nasopharyngeal swabs were collected from, and malaria diagnosis tests (thick blood smears) carried out on, every febrile individual during clinical visits; reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction was used to identify influenza viruses in the samples. Binomial negative regression analysis was used to study the relationship between the monthly incidence rate and various covariates.In Dielmo and Ndiop, the incidence of malaria has decreased, but fever syndromes remain frequent. Among the 1036 inhabitants included in the cohort, a total of 1,129 episodes of fever were reported. Influenza was present all year round with peaks in October-December 2012 and August 2013. The fever, ILI and influenza incidence density rates differed significantly between age groups. At both sites, the adjusted incidence relative risks for fever syndromes and ILI were significantly higher in the [6-24 months) than other age groups: 7.3 (95%CI: [5.7-9.3]) and 16.1 (95%CI: [11.1-23.3]) respectively. The adjusted incidence relative risk for influenza was significantly higher for the [0-6 months) than other age groups: 9.9 (95%CI: [2.9-33.6]). At both sites, incidence density rates were lowest among adults > = 50 years.In this rural setting in Senegal, influenza was most frequent among the youngest children.

Kinesin-3 is a subfamily of kinesin motors and plays prominent roles in controlling the transport of synaptic vesicles or endosomes from the cell body to axon tips or cell peripheries (3Hirokawa N.

Kaul N. Soppina V. Kinesin assembly and movement in cells.Annu. Rev. Biophys. 2011; 40: 267-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). In comparison to kinesin-1, the kinesin-3 neck domain contains a similar NL but a shorter NC (∼10 residues shorter than that of kinesin-1) that is followed by a coiled coil (CC1) and the subfamily-specific FHA domain (Fig. 1, B and C). Recent structural studies of the motor domain and NL of KIF1A, the founding member of kinesin-3 subfamily, demonstrated that NL undergoes a similar conformational change upon docking onto the motor domain (17Atherton J. Farabella I. Yu I.M. Rosenfeld S.S. Houdusse A. Topf M. Moores C.A. Conserved mechanisms of microtubule-stimulated ADP release, ATP binding, and force generation in transport kinesins.Elife. 2014; 3: e03680Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), which suggests that kinesin-3 adopts a processive mechanism similar to that of kinesin-1. In contrast, kinesin-3 NC tends to form a weak coiled-coil dimer (rather than a stable coiled-coil) due to its short length (18Tomishige M. Klopfenstein D.R. Vale R.D.

Pierce D.W. Monomeric and dimeric states exhibited by the kinesin-related motor protein KIF1A.J. Pept. Res. 2005; 65: 538-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Moreover, this weak dimer can be further regulated by subsequent CC1. Electron microscopy studies of the neck domain of UNC-104 (KIF1A homolog in Caenorhabditis elegans) showed that CC1 can fold back to associate with NC to form a compact bundle-like structure that keeps the motor in a monomeric inactive state (20Al-Bassam J. Cui Y. Klopfenstein D. Carragher B.O. Vale R.D. Milligan R.A. Distinct conformations of the kinesin Unc104 neck regulate a monomer to dimer motor transition.J. Cell Biol. 2003; 163: 743-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). This intramolecular interaction between the NC and CC1 of UNC-104 was, therefore, suggested to regulate the monomer-dimer switch of the motor and has been indicated to happen in KIF1A as well (21Hammond J.W. Cai D. Blasius T.L. Li Z. Jiang Y. Jih G.T. Meyhofer E. Verhey K.J. Mammalian kinesin-3 motors are dimeric in vivo and move by processive motility upon release of autoinhibition.PLos Biol. 2009; 7: e72Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). More recently, the CC1-mediated regulation of the NC dimer has also been found in other kinesin-3 motors such as KIF13A, KIF13B, and KIF16B (22Soppina V. Norris S.R. Dizaji A.S. Kortus M. Veatch S. Peckham M. Verhey K.J. Dimerization of mammalian kinesin-3 motors results in superprocessive motion.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2014; 111: 5562-5567Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Despite the negative regulation by CC1, the NC-mediated dimerization is required for the processive movement of kinesin-3. Mutations of the hydrophobic residues that are predicted for the NC coiled-coil dimer formation decreased the probability of movement (18Tomishige M. Klopfenstein D.R. Vale R.D.

Chem. 2011; 286: 7457-7467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Recent studies of KIF1A demonstrated that the activation of the motor domain needs an additional stretch of residues (∼10 residues) from the subsequent hinge (21Hammond J.W. Cai D. Blasius T.L. Li Z. Jiang Y. Jih G.T. Meyhofer E. Verhey K.J. Mammalian kinesin-3 motors are dimeric in vivo and move by processive motility upon release of autoinhibition.PLos Biol. 2009; 7: e72Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), suggesting that the formation of the stable NC coiled-coil dimer for processive movement requires an auxiliary element. Moreover, the FHA domain of KIF1A can also work together with CC1 to form an integrated CC1-FHA dimer that would prevent the CC1-mediated inhibition and further stabilize the motor dimer (24Huo L. Yue Y. Ren J. Yu J. Liu J. Yu Y. Ye F. Xu T. Zhang M. Feng W.

Thus, the segments immediately after NC are able to facilitate and stabilize the weak NC dimer to assemble a two-headed motor for active transport (21Hammond J.W. Cai D. Blasius T.L. Li Z. Jiang Y. Jih G.T. Meyhofer E. Verhey K.J. Mammalian kinesin-3 motors are dimeric in vivo and move by processive motility upon release of autoinhibition.PLos Biol. 2009; 7: e72Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 24Huo L. Yue Y.

However, the molecular mechanism underlying the NC coiled-coil dimer formation and how the following CC1-FHA tandem works together with NC for the active motor are both poorly understood. In this study we characterized the NC-CC1-FHA tandem from the kinesin-3 motor KIF13A. Distinct from other kinesin-3 motors, the CC1-FHA tandem of KIF13A is connected to NC by a proline residue Pro-390 (rather than a flexible hinge in KIF1A) (Fig. 1C). The structure of the CC1-FHA tandem of KIF13A revealed that CC1 and the FHA domain are also integrated to form an extended dimer. By removing Pro-390 between NC and CC1, we obtained the structure of the NC-CC1 tandem of KIF13A. Unexpectedly, it forms a continuous coiled-coil dimer that can be well aligned into the CC1-FHA dimer. The data from molecular dynamics simulations further suggested that the introduction of Pro-390 back into the NC-CC1 tandem breaks the continuous coiled-coil dimer but endows it with the intrinsic flexibility to couple NC with the CC1-FHA tandem to form a stable dimer. Thus, these three elements within the NC-CC1-FHA tandem of KIF13A are structurally correlated for the active conformation of the motor. DNA sequences encoding mouse KIF13A fragments including the NC-CC1 tandem (residues 355–445), the CC1-FHA tandem (residues 386–559), the NC-CC1-FHA tandem (residues 355–559), and various mutants were each cloned into a modified version of the pET32a vector. Point mutations were created using the standard PCR-based mutagenesis method and confirmed by DNA sequencing. Recombinant proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 Condon Plus (DE3) host cells at 16 °C. The GB1-His6-tagged fusion proteins were purified by Ni2+-Sepharose 6 Fast Flow (GE Healthcare) affinity chromatography followed by size-exclusion chromatography. After the cleavage of the GB1 tag, the resulting proteins were further purified by another step of size-exclusion chromatography. Native crystals of the CC1-FHA tandem (10 mg/ml in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT) and native and selenomethionine crystals of the NC-CC1(ΔPro-390) mutant (15 mg/ml in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT) were obtained using the sitting-drop vapor diffusion method at 16 °C. The CC1-FHA tandem was crystallized in 0.2 m calcium acetate, 16% (w/v) PEG3350, whereas the NC-CC1(ΔPro-390) mutant was crystallized in 1.7 m ammonium sulfate, 8% (v/v) isopropyl alcohol. The crystals of the CC1-FHA tandem were cryo-protected by the mother liquor supplemented with 30–40% (w/v) PEG3350, and the crystals of the NC-CC1(ΔPro-390) mutant were cryo-protected by the mother liquor supplemented with 12% (v/v) ethylene glycol, and all the crystals were then flash-frozen by plunging into liquid nitrogen. Diffraction data were collected at the beam-line BL17U of the Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility with a wavelength of 0.979 Å at 100 K and were processed and scaled with HKL2000 (25Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Processing of x-ray diffraction data collected in oscillation mode.Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38565) Google Scholar). The structure of the CC1-FHA tandem was determined by the molecular replacement methods using the FHA domain of KIF13B (PDB code 3FM8) as the search model with Phaser (26McCoy A.J. Solving structures of protein complexes by molecular replacement with Phaser.Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2007; 63: 32-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (1247) Google Scholar). Selenium-labeled sites in the crystals of the NC-CC1(ΔPro-390) mutant were determined using the program SHELXD from the CCP4 suite (27Collaborative Computational Project, Number 4 The CCP4 suite: programs for protein crystallography.Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19762) Google Scholar). The single-wavelength anomalous dispersion phasing was obtained, and an initial model was built using AutoSol in PHENIX (28Adams P.D. Afonine P.V. Bunkóczi G. Chen V.B. Davis I.W. Echols N.

Additional missing residues were manually modeled into the structures according to the 2Fo − Fc and Fo − Fc electron density maps. All the structures were further fitted and rebuilt with COOT (29Emsley P. Cowtan K. Coot: model-building tools for molecular graphics.Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2126-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (23344) Google Scholar) and refined with PHENIX (28Adams P.D. Afonine P.V. Bunkóczi G. Chen V.B. Davis I.W. Echols N. Headd J.J. Hung L.W.

The chromatography system was coupled with an 18-angle light-scattering detector (DAWN HELEOS II, Wyatt Technology) and differential refractive index detector (Optilab rEx, Wyatt Technology). Masses (molecular masses) were calculated with ASTRA (Wyatt Technology). Bovine serum albumin (Sigma) was used as the calibration standard. The KIF13A fragments including MD (residues 1–354), MD-NC (residues 1–385), MD-NC-CC1 (residues 1–445), MD-NC-CC1-FHA (residues 1–559), and various mutants were each cloned into a pEGFP-N3 vector. The resulting constructs contained a linker of 14 residues between the KIF13A fragments and the C-terminal GFP tag. N2A (a mouse neuroblastoma cell line) cells were cultured in DMEM containing 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum. The cells were transfected with the KIF13A fragments by Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Fluorescence images were obtained on an Olympus FV1000 laser scanning confocal microscope equipped with a 60× oil-immersion objective lens (NA = 1.42). Confocal settings used for image capture were held constant in comparison experiments. All the fluorescence images were processed and analyzed by ImageJ (National Institutes of Health). The final quantification graphs were generated by Origin (OriginLab). For the cellular distribution data analysis, the specific regions of the cell body (excluding the nucleus) and the tip of each cell were chosen, and the average fluorescence intensities were calculated, respectively. Based on the structures of the CC1-FHA and NC-CC1(ΔPro-390) dimers, the initial structural model of the NC-CC1-FHA dimer of KIF13A was built, and Pro-390 was introduced between NC and CC1. The model structures of the NC-CC1-FHA and NC-CC1(ΔPro-390) dimers were then solvated in a 66 × 85 × 163 Å3 and a 145 × 58 × 58 Å3 water box, respectively, which included 52 Na+ and 34 Cl− ions to neutralize the systems.

Under periodic boundary conditions, a 12 Å cutoff was used for van der Waals interactions, and Particle Mesh Ewald summation was used to calculate the electrostatic interactions. Three independent simulations were performed for each system. For each simulation energy was first carefully minimized in multisteps to avoid any possible clashes. The energy-minimized system was then equilibrated for 5 ns with temperature controlled at 310 K by Langevin dynamics and pressure controlled at 1 atm by the Lagevin piston method (46Martyna G.J.

With the equilibrated structures, 145- and 130-ns free dynamics simulations were performed for the NC-CC1-FHA and NC-CC1(ΔPro-390) dimers, respectively. The simulation trajectories were analyzed with VMD (35Humphrey W. Dalke A. Schulten K. VMD: Visual molecular dynamics.J. Mol. Graph. 1996; 14: 33-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (38802) Google Scholar). To investigate how the CC1-FHA tandem affects NC within kinesin-3 motors, we initiated this study by structural characterization of the CC1-FHA tandem from KIF13A (Fig. 1B). The structure of the CC1-FHA tandem of KIF13A was determined by the molecular replacement method and was refined to 1.74 Å (Table 1). From the overall structure, CC1 and the FHA domain within the CC1-FHA tandem are integrated by a covalent linker to form an elongated parallel dimer (Fig. 2A), which is consistent with the previous structural studies of the CC1-FHA tandem of KIF1A (24Huo L. Yue Y. Ren J. Yu J. Liu J. Yu Y. Ye F. Xu T. Zhang M. Feng W. The CC1-FHA tandem as a central hub for controlling the dimerization and activation of kinesin-3 KIF1A.Structure. 2012; 20: 1550-1561Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In this dimer structure, the FHA domain adopts a classical FHA-fold with 11 strands (β1-β11) to form a β-sandwich, whereas CC1 adopts an α-helical structure (αCC1) to form an extended coiled coil (Fig. 2A). The covalent linker between CC1 and the FHA domain forms two antiparallel strands (βF1 and βF2, referred to as the β-finger) that pair with the β-sandwich of the FHA domain and also contact the C-terminal end of CC1 (Fig. 2). Thus, the β-finger linker likely acts as “glue” to stick CC1 and the FHA domain together to form an integrated dimer. The overall structure of the CC1-FHA dimer of KIF13A is similar to that of KIF1A. However, the β-finger regions of the two dimer structures are different. In the CC1-FHA dimer of KIF1A, the two β-fingers are largely separated, and one of them intimately covers the C-terminal end of CC1, whereas in that of KIF13A the two β-fingers pack with each other to form the central core without extensive contacts with CC1 (Figs. 2A and 3A). This structural difference may be caused by the different lengths of the β-finger regions of KIF1A and KIF13A (Fig. 1C). Additionally, the conformations of CC1 in the two structures are also different, i.e. the two CC1 helices contact each other in the CC1-FHA dimer of KIF13A but are separated in that of KIF1A (Figs. 2A and 3A). To reconcile this difference, we further analyzed the crystal packing of the CC1-FHA tandem of KIF1A and found that the two CC1 helices from one dimer pack with the ones from the other dimer to form a four-helix bundle (Fig. 3B), which would somewhat distort the CC1 coiled-coil dimer. Thus, the separation of the two CC1 helices in the CC1-FHA dimer of KIF1A is most likely to be crystal-packing artifacts. In contrast, the CC1 coiled-coil dimer remains intact in the crystal packing of the CC1-FHA tandem of KIF13A (Fig. 3C). In the CC1-FHA dimer of KIF3A, the dimer interface (buried with ∼5200 Å2) is contributed by the FHA domain, the β-finger, and CC1. Among them, the β-finger is the core component that intimately pairs with the first two β-strands (β1 and β2) of the FHA domain to form a central β-sandwich in the interface (Fig. 2A). Specifically, βF2 of the β-finger augments β2 of the FHA domain in an antiparallel manner, and the hydrophobic packing core of the central β-sandwich is constructed by Ile-433 and Leu-435 from βF1, Ile-440 and Val-442 from βF2, Tyr-448 and Val-450 from β1, and Leu-462, Val-463, and Tyr-465 from β2 (Fig. 4, A–C). Moreover, one open site of the central β-sandwich is capped by the C-terminal ends of the two CC1 helices, i.e. Leu-428 and Met-431 from CC1 make the hydrophobic contacts with Ile-433 and Leu-435 from βF1 of the β-finger (Fig. 4, A–C), which would further stabilize the central dimer interface. Besides the central β-sandwich formed by the FHA domain and the β-finger, CC1 forms an extended coiled-coil dimer that facilitates the dimer formation (Fig. 2A). Based on the heptad repeat pattern (a–g) analysis, the interhelical packing between the coiled-coil dimer is largely mediated by the hydrophobic residues (Leu-392, Leu-396, Ile-I403, Leu-406 and Leu-414) in the a and d sites of the CC1 helix (Fig. 4, A, D, and E). However, a number of hydrophilic residues (Ser-399, Thr-417, and Arg-424) were found in the interhelical packing interface (Fig. 4, A, D, and E), which would somewhat destabilize the CC1 coiled coil. The repulsion between the positively charged side chains of the two Arg-424 residues is also likely to induce an obvious kink at the C terminus of one of the two CC1 helices (Fig. 4D), which results in an asymmetric conformation of the CC1-FHA dimer (Fig. 2A). Moreover, the steric hindrance between the bulky aromatic side chains of the two Trp-410 residues in the middle would produce another twist in the CC1 helix (Fig. 4D). In addition to the above potential defects in the interhelical packing, the coiled-coil stacking in the middle of the CC1 helix is also irregular,"
https://openalex.org/W2285442564,"In stem cell cultures from adult human tissue, undesirable contamination with fibroblasts is frequently present. The presence of fibroblasts obscures the actual number of stem cells and may result in extracellular matrix production after transplantation. Identification of fibroblasts is difficult because of the lack of specific fibroblast markers. In our laboratory, we isolate and expand neural-crest-derived stem cells from human hair follicle bulges and investigate their potential to differentiate into neural cells. To establish cellular identities, we perform immunohistochemistry with antibodies specific for glial and neuronal markers, and use fibroblasts as negative control. We frequently observe that human adult dermal fibroblasts also express some glial and neuronal markers. In this study, we have sought to determine whether our observations represent actual expression of these markers or result from cross-reactivity. Immunohistochemistry was performed on human adult dermal fibroblasts using acknowledged glial and neuronal antibodies followed by verification of the data using RT-qPCR. Human adult dermal fibroblasts showed expression of the glia-specific markers SOX9, glial fibrillary acidic protein and EGR2 (KROX20) as well as for the neuron-specific marker class III β-tubulin, both at the protein and mRNA level. Furthermore, human adult dermal fibroblasts showed false-positive immunostaining for S100β and GAP43 and to a lower extent for OCT6. Our results indicate that immunophenotyping as a tool to determine cellular identity is not as reliable as generally assumed, especially since human adult dermal fibroblasts may be mistaken for neural cells, indicating that the ultimate proof of glial or neuronal identity can only be provided by their functionality."
https://openalex.org/W2199098637,"The independent skeletal effect of thyrotropin (thyroid stimulating hormone, TSH) has been suggested in animal studies. However, clinical data on the association between bone loss and variations in TSH levels is inconsistent. This study aimed to investigate the relationship between TSH levels and bone mineral density (BMD).We conducted a cross-sectional study with 37,431 subjects (33,052 cases with euthyroidism and 4,379 cases with subclinical thyroid dysfunction) aged over 35 years. We performed thyroid function tests and measured BMD at the lumbar spine, femur neck, and total hip.Levels of TSH and T3 were positively correlated in women (r = 0.076, P = 0.001) and uncorrelated in men. In both men and women, TSH levels correlated positively and T3 levels correlated negatively with BMD at all skeletal sites in age and body mass index adjusted analyses. BMD increased steadily with TSH levels from the subclinical hyperthyroid to subclinical hypothyroid range in subjects with T3 levels in the highest tertile (119.5-200.0 ng/dL), but was no longer significant in subjects with lower plasma T3 levels.The variations in TSH levels within the euthyroid and subclinical range were positively correlated with BMD in healthy men and women. The negative effect of T3 on BMD appears to be compensated for by increased TSH in subjects with plasma T3 levels in the upper normal range."
https://openalex.org/W2216252871,"In any setting, a proportion of incident active tuberculosis (TB) reflects recent transmission (“recent transmission proportion”), whereas the remainder represents reactivation. Appropriately estimating the recent transmission proportion has important implications for local TB control, but existing approaches have known biases, especially where data are incomplete. We constructed a stochastic individual-based model of a TB epidemic and designed a set of simulations (derivation set) to develop two regression-based tools for estimating the recent transmission proportion from five inputs: underlying TB incidence, sampling coverage, study duration, clustered proportion of observed cases, and proportion of observed clusters in the sample. We tested these tools on a set of unrelated simulations (validation set), and compared their performance against that of the traditional ‘n-1’ approach. In the validation set, the regression tools reduced the absolute estimation bias (difference between estimated and true recent transmission proportion) in the ‘n-1’ technique by a median [interquartile range] of 60% [9%, 82%] and 69% [30%, 87%]. The bias in the ‘n-1’ model was highly sensitive to underlying levels of study coverage and duration, and substantially underestimated the recent transmission proportion in settings of incomplete data coverage. By contrast, the regression models’ performance was more consistent across different epidemiological settings and study characteristics. We provide one of these regression models as a user-friendly, web-based tool. Novel tools can improve our ability to estimate the recent TB transmission proportion from data that are observable (or estimable) by public health practitioners with limited available molecular data."
https://openalex.org/W2215239616,"Random Forest has become a standard data analysis tool in computational biology. However, extensions to existing implementations are often necessary to handle the complexity of biological datasets and their associated research questions. The growing size of these datasets requires high performance implementations. We describe CloudForest, a Random Forest package written in Go, which is particularly well suited for large, heterogeneous, genetic and biomedical datasets. CloudForest includes several extensions, such as dealing with unbalanced classes and missing values. Its flexible design enables users to easily implement additional extensions. CloudForest achieves fast running times by effective use of the CPU cache, optimizing for different classes of features and efficiently multi-threading. https://github.com/ilyalab/CloudForest."
https://openalex.org/W2218117846,"Recombinant human adenovirus serotype 5 (HAd5V) vectors are gold standards of T-cell immunogenicity as they efficiently induce also humoral responses to exogenous antigens, in particular when used in prime-boost protocols. Some investigators have shown that pre-existing immunity to adenoviruses interferes with transduction by adenoviral vectors, but the actual extent of this interference is not known since it has been mostly studied in mice using unnatural routes of infection and virus doses. Here we studied the effects of HAd5V-specific immune responses induced by intranasal infection on the transduction efficiency of recombinant adenovirus vectors. Of interest, when HAd5V immunity was induced in mice by the natural respiratory route, the pre-existing immunity against HAd5V did not significantly interfere with the B and T-cell immune responses against the transgene products induced after a prime/boost inoculation protocol with a recombinant HAd5V-vector, as measured by ELISA and in vivo cytotoxic T-cell assays, respectively. We also correlated the levels of HAd5V-specific neutralizing antibodies (Ad5NAbs) induced in mice with the levels of Ad5NAb titers found in humans. The data indicate that approximately 60% of the human serum samples tested displayed Ad5NAb levels that could be overcome with a prime-boost vaccination protocol. These results suggest that recombinant HAd5V vectors are potentially useful for prime-boost vaccination strategies, at least when pre-existing immunity against HAd5V is at low or medium levels."
https://openalex.org/W2297046378,"In patients with short-term exposure to the sulfur mustard gas, the delayed cellular effects on lungs have not been well understood yet. The lung pathology shows a dominant feature consistent with obliterative bronchiolitis, in which fibroblasts play a central role. This study aims to characterize alterations to lung fibroblasts, at the cellular level, in patients with delayed respiratory complications after short-term exposure to the sulfur mustard gas.Fibroblasts were isolated from the transbronchial biopsies of patients with documented history of exposure to single high-dose sulfur mustard during 1985-7 and compared with the fibroblasts of control subjects.Compared with controls, patients' fibroblasts were thinner and shorter, and showed a higher population doubling level, migration capacity and number of filopodia. Sulfur mustard decreased the in vitro viability of fibroblasts and increased their sensitivity to induction of apoptosis, but did not change the rate of spontaneous apoptosis. In addition, higher expression of alpha smooth muscle actin showed that the lung's microenvironment in these patients is permissive for myofibroblastic differentiation.These findings suggest that in patients under the study, the delayed pulmonary complications of sulfur mustard should be considered as a unique pathology, which might need a specific management by manipulation of cellular components."
