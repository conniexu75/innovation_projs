For practical catalysts, nanomaterials with high surface areas are needed. However, for nanoparticles, strain is often induced with overlayers (adsorbates or heteroatoms) that can undergo reconstruction during operation that releases the induced strain. Wang et al. show that freestanding palladium nanosheets (three to five monolayers thick) form with an internal compressive strain of 1 to 2% and can be much more active for both the oxygen and hydrogen evolution reactions under alkaline conditions compared with nanoparticles.

https://openalex.org/W2916442064,"Reductive electrosynthesis has faced long-standing challenges in applications to complex organic substrates at scale. Here, we show how decades of research in lithium-ion battery materials, electrolytes, and additives can serve as an inspiration for achieving practically scalable reductive electrosynthetic conditions for the Birch reduction. Specifically, we demonstrate that using a sacrificial anode material (magnesium or aluminum), combined with a cheap, nontoxic, and water-soluble proton source (dimethylurea), and an overcharge protectant inspired by battery technology [tris(pyrrolidino)phosphoramide] can allow for multigram-scale synthesis of pharmaceutically relevant building blocks. We show how these conditions have a very high level of functional-group tolerance relative to classical electrochemical and chemical dissolving-metal reductions. Finally, we demonstrate that the same electrochemical conditions can be applied to other dissolving metal-type reductive transformations, including McMurry couplings, reductive ketone deoxygenations, and epoxide openings."

https://openalex.org/W2916366474,"Coincidence detection in synaptogenesis In the brain, synaptic connections are formed with exquisite specificity, but the underlying molecular mechanisms remain largely unexplored. Synapse formation is thought to involve bidirectional signaling by proteins that bind to each other across the synaptic cleft. Sando et al. used conditional genetic tools and in vitro assays to investigate the mechanisms of synapse formation. They found that synapse formation in the mouse hippocampus requires latrophilins. Latrophilins are G protein–coupled receptors that bind to cell-surface proteins called teneurins and fibronectin leucine-rich repeat transmembrane proteins (FLRTs). Two different latrophilins mediated formation of distinct synapses on the same hippocampal neuron. This function required binding of both teneurins and FLRTs. Thus, latrophilins may guide synapse formation by coincidence signaling, which could help to explain the specificity of synaptic connections. Science , this issue p. eaav7969"

https://openalex.org/W2916496760,"Chloroplasts contain thousands of nucleus-encoded proteins that are imported from the cytosol by translocases in the chloroplast envelope membranes. Proteolytic regulation of the translocases is critically important, but little is known about the underlying mechanisms. We applied forward genetics and proteomics in Arabidopsis to identify factors required for chloroplast outer envelope membrane (OEM) protein degradation. We identified SP2, an Omp85-type β-barrel channel of the OEM, and CDC48, a cytosolic AAA+ (ATPase associated with diverse cellular activities) chaperone. Both proteins acted in the same pathway as the ubiquitin E3 ligase SP1, which regulates OEM translocase components. SP2 and CDC48 cooperated to bring about retrotranslocation of ubiquitinated substrates from the OEM (fulfilling conductance and motor functions, respectively), enabling degradation of the substrates by the 26S proteasome in the cytosol. Such chloroplast-associated protein degradation (CHLORAD) is vital for organellar functions and plant development."

It would seem straightforward to likewise access five-membered rings from dienes and one-carbon sources, or carbenes, but that does not tend to work. Instead, the carbene adds to just half of the diene to form a cyclopropane. Zhou and Uyeda now show that a catalyst with two nickel centers can steer this reaction toward the cyclopentyl products (see the Perspective by Johnson and Weix).

https://openalex.org/W2915299452,"Historically, the rat has been the preferred animal model for behavioral studies. Limitations in genome modification have, however, caused a lag in their use compared to the bevy of available transgenic mice. Here, we have developed several transgenic tools, including viral vectors and transgenic rats, for targeted genome modification in specific adult rat neurons using CRISPR-Cas9 technology. Starting from wild-type rats, knockout of tyrosine hydroxylase was achieved with adeno-associated viral (AAV) vectors expressing Cas9 or guide RNAs (gRNAs). We subsequently created an AAV vector for Cre-dependent gRNA expression as well as three new transgenic rat lines to specifically target CRISPR-Cas9 components to dopaminergic neurons. One rat represents the first knockin rat model made by germline gene targeting in spermatogonial stem cells. The rats described herein serve as a versatile platform for making cell-specific and sequence-specific genome modifications in the adult brain and potentially other Cre-expressing tissues of the rat."
https://openalex.org/W2917942389,"Nuclear localization of androgen receptor (AR) directs transcriptional regulation of a host of genes, referred to as genomic signaling. Additionally, nonnuclear or nongenomic activities of the AR have long been described, but understanding of these activities remains elusive. Here, we report that AR is imported into and localizes to mitochondria and has a novel role in regulating multiple mitochondrial processes. Employing complementary experimental approaches of AR knockdown in AR-expressing cells and ectopic AR expression in AR-deficient cells, we demonstrate an inverse relationship between AR expression and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) content and transcription factor A, mitochondrial (TFAM), a regulator of mtDNA content. We show that AR localizes to mitochondria in prostate tissues and cell lines and is imported into mitochondria in vitro We also found that AR contains a 36-amino-acid-long mitochondrial localization sequence (MLS) capable of targeting a passenger protein (GFP) to the mitochondria and that deletion of the MLS abolishes the import of AR into the mitochondria. Ectopic AR expression reduced the expression of oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) subunits. Interestingly, AR also controlled translation of mtDNA-encoded genes by regulating expression of multiple nuclear DNA-encoded mitochondrial ribosomal proteins. Consistent with these observations, OXPHOS supercomplexes were destabilized, and OXPHOS enzymatic activities were reduced in AR-expressing cells and restored upon AR knockdown. Moreover, mitochondrial impairment induced AR expression and increased its translocation into mitochondria. We conclude that AR localizes to mitochondria, where it controls multiple mitochondrial functions and mitonuclear communication. Our studies also suggest that mitochondria are novel players in nongenomic activities of AR."

https://openalex.org/W2917355827,"The increasing emergence of multidrug-resistant microorganisms represents one of the greatest challenges in the clinical management of infectious diseases, and requires the development of novel antimicrobial agents. To this aim, we de novo designed a library of Arg-rich ultra-short cationic antimicrobial lipopeptides (USCLs), based on the Arg-X-Trp-Arg-NH2 peptide moiety conjugated with a fatty acid, and investigated their antibacterial potential. USCLs exhibited an excellent antimicrobial activity against clinically pathogenic microorganisms, in particular Gram-positive bacteria, including multidrug resistant strains, with MIC values ranging between 1.56 and 6.25 μg/mL. The capability of the two most active molecules, Lau-RIWR-NH2 and Lau-RRIWRR-NH2, to interact with the bacterial membranes has been predicted by molecular dynamics and verified on liposomes by surface plasmon resonance. Both compounds inhibited the growth of S. aureus even at sub MIC concentrations and induced cell membranes permeabilization by producing visible cell surface alterations leading to a significant decrease in bacterial viability. Interestingly, no cytotoxic effects were evidenced for these lipopeptides up to 50-100 μg/mL in hemolysis assay, in human epidermal model and HaCaT cells, thus highlighting a good cell selectivity. These results, together with the simple composition of USCLs, make them promising lead compounds as new antimicrobials."
https://openalex.org/W2917509723,"Small Ruminant Lentiviruses (SRLV) include at least 4 viral highly divergent genotypes. Genotypes A and B are widely distributed and genotypes C and E have been recognized in restricted geographic areas. New phylogroups have been identified targeting conserved regions. However, this approach suffers from the potential risk to misamplify highly divergent strains. Pathogenic strains are easily adapted to fibroblastic cells, but non-pathogenic strains isolation may require a different approach. We developed a fast and effective method for SRLV full genome characterization after cell culture isolation. Spleen samples were collected during regular slaughter from sheep and goats in northwestern Italy. Spleen-derived macrophage cultures were monitored for reverse transcriptase activity and RNA was extracted from the supernatant of positive cultures. Using Illumina MiSeq platform 22 new full genome sequences were obtained. The success of this approach is based on the following features: spleen is one of the main target for SRLV persistence; red pulp is a reserve of resident macrophages, the main target for SRLV replication in vivo; RTA is a sensitive assay for any replicating retrovirus; de novo sequencing do not require genetic knowledge in advance."

MMP´s are also involved in the pathophysiological processes underlying chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Cigarette smoking plays an important role in both disease states and is also known to affect the concentration and activity of MMP´s systemically. Unfortunately, the epidemiological data concerning the value of MMP´s as biomarkers of COPD and atherosclerosis with special regards to smoking habits are limited.450 middle-aged subjects with records of smoking habits and tobacco consumption were examined with comprehensive spirometry, carotid ultrasound examination and biomarker analysis of MMP-1, -3, -7, -10 and -12. Due to missing data 33 subjects were excluded.The remaining 417 participants were divided into 4 different groups. Group I (n = 157, no plaque and no COPD), group II (n = 136, plaque but no COPD), group III (n = 43, COPD but no plaque) and group IV (n = 81, plaque and COPD). Serum levels of MMP-1,-7,-10-12 were significantly influenced by smoking, and MMP-1, -3, -7 and-12 were elevated in subjects with COPD and carotid plaque. This remained statistically significant for MMP-1 and-12 after adjusting for traditional risk factors.COPD and concomitant plaque in the carotid artery were associated with elevated levels of MMP-1 and -MMP-12 even when adjusting for risk factors. Further studies are needed to elucidate if these two MMP´s could be useful as biomarkers in a clinical setting. Smoking was associated with increased serum levels of MMP´s (except for MMP-3) and should be taken into account when interpreting serum MMP results."
https://openalex.org/W2915765960,"Rett syndrome (RTT) is a pervasive developmental disorder caused by mutations in MECP2. Complete loss of MECP2 function in males causes congenital encephalopathy, neurodevelopmental arrest, and early lethality. Induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) lines from male patients harboring mutations in MECP2, along with control lines from their unaffected fathers, give us an opportunity to identify some of the earliest cellular and molecular changes associated with MECP2 loss-of-function (LOF). We differentiated iPSC-derived neural progenitor cells (NPCs) using retinoic acid (RA) and found that astrocyte differentiation is perturbed in iPSC lines derived from two different patients. Using highly stringent quantitative proteomic analyses, we found that LIN28, a gene important for cell fate regulation and developmental timing, is upregulated in mutant NPCs compared to WT controls. Overexpression of LIN28 protein in control NPCs suppressed astrocyte differentiation and reduced neuronal synapse density, whereas downregulation of LIN28 expression in mutant NPCs partially rescued this synaptic deficiency. These results indicate that the pathophysiology of RTT may be caused in part by misregulation of developmental timing in neural progenitors, and the subsequent consequences of this disruption on neuronal and glial differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W2918005000,"In type 1 diabetes, an autoimmune event increases oxidative stress in islet β cells, giving rise to cellular dysfunction and apoptosis. Lipoxygenases are enzymes that catalyze the oxygenation of polyunsaturated fatty acids that can form lipid metabolites involved in several biological functions, including oxidative stress. 12-Lipoxygenase and 12/15-lipoxygenase are related but distinct enzymes that are expressed in pancreatic islets, but their relative contributions to oxidative stress in these regions are still being elucidated. In this study, we used mice with global genetic deletion of the genes encoding 12-lipoxygenase (arachidonate 12-lipoxygenase, 12S type [Alox12]) or 12/15-lipoxygenase (Alox15) to compare the influence of each gene deletion on β cell function and survival in response to the β cell toxin streptozotocin. Alox12−/− mice exhibited greater impairment in glucose tolerance following streptozotocin exposure than WT mice, whereas Alox15−/− mice were protected against dysglycemia. These changes were accompanied by evidence of islet oxidative stress in Alox12−/− mice and reduced oxidative stress in Alox15−/− mice, consistent with alterations in the expression of the antioxidant response enzymes in islets from these mice. Additionally, islets from Alox12−/− mice displayed a compensatory increase in Alox15 gene expression, and treatment of these mice with the 12/15-lipoxygenase inhibitor ML-351 rescued the dysglycemic phenotype. Collectively, these results indicate that Alox12 loss activates a compensatory increase in Alox15 that sensitizes mouse β cells to oxidative stress."
https://openalex.org/W2917603959,"Enhanced surveillance of invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) in adults was conducted during April 2013–March 2018 in 10 of 47 prefectures in Japan, and a total of 1277 IPD patients were enrolled. An emergence of IPD caused by serotype 12F was identified during May 2015–March 2018 through this surveillance. 12F isolates were composed of four related sequence types. In total, 120 patients with 12F IPD were reported during this period. To characterize the clinical features of 12F IPD, the disease characteristics of these patients were compared with those of 1157 patients with non-12F IPD. Compared with the non-12F IPD patients, a significantly lower proportion of 12F IPD patients was aged 65 years or older (55% vs. 70%), vaccinated with 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide (4% vs. 14%), had comorbid illness (65% vs. 77%), or were immunocompromised (19% vs. 30%; all P < 0.05). No significant difference in the proportion of case fatalities was found between the two groups. The proportions of those aged 65 years or older (53% vs. 69%) and with bacteremic pneumonia (35% vs. 69%) were significantly lower in 17 patients who died from 12F IPD than in 205 patients who died from non-12F IPD (all P < 0.05). Differences in clinical features were similarly found between 12F IPD patients and patients in low- or intermediate-level invasive potential serogroups. Our data demonstrated that serotype 12F was associated with IPD in younger adults and a lower proportion of comorbid illness, including immunocompromised conditions, in adult IPD, suggesting the high invasive potential of the serotype 12F. In addition, patients who died from 12F IPD were younger and had proportionately more bacteremia without focus. These findings may provide new insight into the pathogenesis of IPD in adults caused by 12F serotype with a high invasive potential."
https://openalex.org/W2918084718,"Fluoxetine (FLX) is a pharmaceutical used to treat affective disorders in humans, but as environmental contaminant also affects inadvertently exposed fish in urban watersheds. In humans and fish, acute FLX treatment and exposure are linked to endocrine disruption, including effects on the reproductive and stress axes. Using the zebrafish model, we build on the recent finding that developmental FLX exposure reduced cortisol production across generations, to determine possible parental and/or life-stage-dependent (age and/or breeding experience) contributions to this phenotype. Specifically, we combined control and developmentally FLX-exposed animals of both sexes (F0) into four distinct breeding groups mated at 5 and 9 months, and measured offspring (F1) basal cortisol at 12 dpf. Basal cortisol was lower in F1 descended from developmentally FLX-exposed F0 females bred at 5, but not 9 months, revealing a maternal, life-stage dependent effect. To investigate potential molecular contributions to this phenotype, we profiled maternally deposited transcripts involved in endocrine stress axis development and regulation, epigenetic (de novo DNA methyltransferases) and post-transcriptional (miRNA pathway components and specific miRNAs) regulation of gene expression in unfertilized eggs. Maternal FLX exposure resulted in decreased transcript abundance of glucocorticoid receptor, dnmt3 paralogues and miRNA pathway components in eggs collected at 5 months, and increased transcript abundance of miRNA pathway components at 9 months. Specific miRNAs predicted to target stress axis transcripts decreased (miR-740) or increased (miR-26, miR-30d, miR-92a, miR-103) in eggs collected from FLX females at 5 months. Increased abundance of miRNA-30d and miRNA-92a persisted in eggs collected from FLX females at 9 months. Clustering and principal component analyses of egg transcript profiles separated eggs collected from FLX-females at 5 months from other groups, suggesting that oocyte molecular signatures, and miRNAs in particular, may serve as predictive tools for the offspring phenotype of reduced basal cortisol in response to maternal FLX exposure."

The issue with this treatment is the unstable survival of CEA on the inactivated dermis. In this study, we applied collagen/gelatin sponge (CGS), which can sustain the release of basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), to the inactivated skin in order to accelerate angiogenesis. Murine skin grafts from C57BL6J/Jcl mice (8 mm in diameter) were prepared, inactivated by HHP and cryopreserved. One month later, the grafts were transplanted subcutaneously onto the back of other mice and covered by CGS impregnated with saline or bFGF. Grafts were harvested after one, two and eight weeks, at which point the engraftment was evaluated through the histology and angiogenesis-related gene expressions were determined by real-time polymerase chain reaction. Histological sections showed that the dermal cellular density and newly formed capillaries in the bFGF group were significantly higher than in the control group. The relative expression of FGF-2, PDGF-A and VEGF-A genes in the bFGF group was significantly higher than in the control group at Week 1. This study suggested that the angiogenesis into grafts was accelerated, which might improve the engraftment of inactivated dermis in combination with the sustained release of bFGF by CGSs."
https://openalex.org/W2915112013,"The phosphate sensing and acquisition (PHO) pathway of Cryptococcus neoformans is essential for growth in phosphate-limiting conditions and for dissemination of infection in a mouse model. Its key transcription factor, Pho4, regulates expression of genes controlling the acquisition of phosphate from both external and cellular sources. One such gene, BTA1, is highly up-regulated during phosphate starvation. Given that a significant proportion of cellular phosphate is incorporated into phospholipids, and that the Pho4-dependent BTA1 gene encodes an enzyme predicted to catalyse production of a phosphorus-free betaine lipid, we investigated whether phospholipids provide an accessible reservoir of phosphate during phosphate deficiency. By comparing lipid profiles of phosphate-starved WT C. neoformans, PHO4 (pho4Δ) and BTA1 (bta1Δ) deletion mutants using thin layer chromatography and liquid chromatography mass spectrometry, we showed that phosphatidylcholine (PC) is substituted by the phosphorus-free betaine lipids diacylglyceryl-N,N,N-trimethylhomoserine (DGTS) and diacylgyceryl hydroxymethyl-N,N,N-trimethyl-beta-alanine (DGTA) in a Pho4- and Bta1-dependent manner, and that BTA1 encodes a functional DGTS synthase. Synthesis of DGTA tightly correlated with that of DGTS, consistent with DGTS being the precursor of DGTA. Similar to pho4Δ, bta1Δ grew more slowly than WT in cell culture medium (RPMI) and was hypovirulent in a murine model of cryptococcosis. In contrast to pho4Δ, bta1Δ tolerated alkaline pH and disseminated to the brain. Our results demonstrate that Bta1-dependent substitution of PC by betaine lipids is tightly regulated in C. neoformans by the PHO pathway, to conserve phosphate and preserve membrane integrity and function. This phospholipid remodeling strategy may also contribute to cryptococcal virulence during host infection."
https://openalex.org/W2917465099,"Endotoxin, a component of the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria, has been extensively studied as a stimulator of the innate immune response. However, the temporal aspects and exposure-response relationship of endotoxin and resulting cytokine induction and tolerance development is less well defined. The aim of this work was to establish an in silico model that simultaneously captures and connects the in vivo time-courses of endotoxin, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and associated tolerance development. Data from six studies of porcine endotoxemia in anesthetized piglets (n = 116) were combined and used in the analysis, with purified endotoxin (Escherichia coli O111:B4) being infused intravenously for 1–30 h in rates of 0.063–16.0 μg/kg/h across studies. All data were modelled simultaneously by means of importance sampling in the non-linear mixed effects modelling software NONMEM. The infused endotoxin followed one-compartment disposition and non-linear elimination, and stimulated the production of TNF-α to describe the rapid increase in plasma concentration. Tolerance development, observed as declining TNF-α concentration with continued infusion of endotoxin, was also driven by endotoxin as a concentration-dependent increase in the potency parameter related to TNF-α production (EC50). Production of IL-6 was stimulated by both endotoxin and TNF-α, and four consecutive transit compartments described delayed increase in plasma IL-6. A model which simultaneously account for the time-courses of endotoxin and two immune response markers, the cytokines TNF-α and IL-6, as well as the development of endotoxin tolerance, was successfully established. This model-based approach is unique in its description of the time-courses and their interrelation and may be applied within research on immune response to bacterial endotoxin, or in pre-clinical pharmaceutical research when dealing with study design or translational aspects."
https://openalex.org/W2915829925,"Background Recent reports of increasing prevalence of frequent health complaints and mental health problems among adolescents call for directing more attention on determinants of adolescent health. The relationship between health and social capital has gained increased attention since the early 2000’s and research at review level confirms the importance of social capital for health outcomes, despite methodological heterogeneity. The aim of this study was to identify distinct profiles of family, school and peer social capital in a nationally representative sample of adolescents and to explore health outcomes in those profiles. Method Cross-sectional data from the Swedish Health Behaviour of School-aged Children 2013/14 was used for this study. The analytical sample consisted of 7,804 adolescents aged 11-, 13- and 15-years. Items representing sense of belonging and emotional support were assessed in three contexts; family, school and among peers. Latent profile analyses (LPA) were run to determine social capital profiles. Health outcomes included frequent health complaints and life satisfaction, while socioeconomic status and genders were included as predictors. Results The results show that five distinct profiles best represent the data for 11- and 15-year olds, while a four-profile model was optimal for 13-year olds. Some profiles were recurrent between age groups but unique profiles were also found. Health outcomes were significantly different between profiles depending on levels of social capital in the different contexts. Conclusions This study provides novel insight into how social capital co-occurs among adolescents within the contexts of family, school and peers and how this translates into differences in health outcomes. The national representativeness of the sample increases the implications of the results and contributes to meaningful insights that help explain the interactions of social capital in multiple contexts, complementing what is previously known about the relationship with adolescent health."
https://openalex.org/W2915688354,"We previously analyzed the expression of genes associated with Paris polyphylla var. yunnanensis seed maturation and dormancy release; however, we were unable to clarify the relationship between gene expression levels and these processes. To reveal the molecular mechanisms underlying P. polyphylla var. yunnanensis seed dormancy release during a warm stratification, the transcriptomes of dormant and germinating P. polyphylla var. yunnanensis seeds were separately analyzed by RNA sequencing and were also compared with the transcriptomes of stem-leaf and root tissues harvested during the seed maturation stage. The RNA sequencing of five tissues generated 234,331 unigenes, of which 10,137 (4.33%) were differentially expressed among the analyzed tissues. The 6,619 unigenes whose expression varied among mature dormant, sprouted, and germinated seeds included 95 metabolic and 62 signaling genes related to abscisic acid, gibberellin, auxin, brassinosteroid, cytokinin, ethylene, jasmonic acid and salicylic acid. Additionally, 243 differentially expressed genes were annotated as known seed dormancy/germination-related genes. Among these genes, 109 were regulated by hormones or involved in hormone signal transduction. Finally, 310 transcription factor unigenes, including 71 homologs of known seed dormancy/ germination-related genes, were observed to be differentially expressed during a warm stratification. These results confirm that multiple hormones and transcription factors influence P. polyphylla var. yunnanensis seed dormancy release and germination during a warm stratification. This study identified candidate genes (e.g., ABI5) that should be cloned and functionally characterized regarding their effects on the release of P. polyphylla var. yunnanensis seed morphophysiological dormancy."
https://openalex.org/W2917255522,"Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is a neuromodulatory approach for treatment of several neurological and psychiatric disorders. A new focus on optimising the waveforms used for stimulation is emerging regarding the mechanism of DBS treatment. Many existing DBS devices offer only a limited set of predefined waveforms, mainly rectangular, and hence are inapt for exploring the emerging paradigm. Advances in clinical DBS are moving towards incorporating new stimulation parameters, yet we remain limited in our capacity to test these in animal models, arguably a critical first step. Accordingly, there is a need for the development of new miniature, low-power devices to enable investigation into the new DBS paradigms in preclinical settings. The ideal device would allow for flexibility in the stimulation waveforms, while remaining suitable for chronic, tetherless, biphasic deep brain stimulation. In this work, we elucidate several key parameters in a DBS system, identify gaps in existing solutions, and propose a new device to support preclinical DBS. The device allows for a high degree of flexibility in the output waveform with easily altered shape, frequency, pulse-width and amplitude. The device is suitable for both traditional and modern stimulation schemes, including those using non-rectangular waveforms, as well as delayed feedback schemes. The device incorporates active charge balancing to ensure safe operation, and allows for simple production of custom biphasic waveforms. This custom waveform output is unique in the field of preclinical DBS devices, and could be advantageous in performing future DBS studies investigating new treatment paradigms. This tetherless device can be easily and comfortably carried by an animal in a back-mountable configuration. The results of in-vitro tests are presented and discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2951763360,"Motilin is a gastrointestinal peptide hormone that stimulates gastrointestinal motility. Motilin is produced primarily in the duodenum and jejunum. Motilin receptors (MTLRs) are G protein-coupled receptors that may represent a clinically useful pharmacological target as they can be activated by erythromycin. The functions of motilin are highly species-dependent and remain poorly understood. As a functional motilin system is absent in rodents such as rats and mice, these species are not commonly used for basic studies. In this study, we examine the usefulness of human MTLR-overexpressing transgenic (hMTLR-Tg) mice by identifying the mechanisms of the gastric motor response to human motilin and erythromycin. The distribution of hMTLR was examined immunohistochemically in male wild-type (WT) and hMTLR-Tg mice. The contractile response of gastric strips was measured isometrically in an organ bath, while gastric emptying was determined using phenol red. hMTLR expression was abundant in the gastric smooth muscle layer. Interestingly, higher levels of hMTLR expression were observed in the myenteric plexus of hMTLR-Tg mice but not WT mice. hMTLR was not co-localized with vesicular acetylcholine transporter, a marker of cholinergic neurons in the myenteric plexus. Treatment with human motilin and erythromycin caused concentration-dependent contraction of gastric strips obtained from hMTLR-Tg mice but not from WT mice. The contractile response to human motilin and erythromycin in hMTLR-Tg mice was affected by neither atropine nor tetrodotoxin and was totally absent in Ca2+-free conditions. Furthermore, intraperitoneal injection of erythromycin significantly promoted gastric emptying in hMTLR-Tg mice but not in WT mice. Human motilin and erythromycin stimulate gastric smooth muscle contraction in hMTLR-Tg mice. This action is mediated by direct contraction of smooth muscle via the influx of extracellular Ca2+.

We hypothesized that the Latin America Zika epidemic resulted in pregnant women and their partners adopting behavioral changes to limit risk, leading them to forego travel to Zika-affected locations. We evaluated this hypothesis by studying travelers’ intent and behavior through Twitter data related to babymoon: a holiday taken by parents-to-be before their baby is born. We found the odds of mentioning representative Zika-affected locations in #babymoon tweets dropped significantly (Odds ratio: 0.29, 95% CI: 0.20–0.40) after the Zika-microcephaly association became well-known. This result was further corroborated through a content analysis of #babymoon tweets mentioning Zika-affected locations, which identified if the Twitter user was physically present in the Zika-affected locations. Conversely, we found a small but statistically insignificant increase in the odds of mentioning Zika-free locations from #babymoon tweets (Odds Ratio: 1.11, 95% CI: 0.97–1.27) after the Zika-microcephaly association became well-known."
https://openalex.org/W2916374247,"Witnesses are likely to describe a crime many times before testifying or encountering misinformation about that crime. Research examining the effect of retrieval on later suggestibility has yielded mixed results. LaPaglia and Chan manipulated whether misinformation was presented in a narrative or misleading questions, and they found that retrieval increased suggestibility when misinformation was presented in a narrative, but reduced suggestibility when the same misinformation was presented in questions. In the current study, we aimed to address why these differences occurred. Specifically, we examined whether contextual detail and narrative coherence during misinformation exposure influenced the relation between retrieval and suggestibility. Participants watched a robbery video and some were questioned about the event afterwards. They were then exposed to misinformation presented in a narrative (Experiment 1) or questions (Experiment 2) before taking a final memory test. Testing enhanced suggestibility when the misinformation phase reinstated contextual information of the event, but not when the misinformation phase included few contextual details-regardless of whether the misinformation was in a narrative or questions. In Experiment 3, disrupting narrative coherence by randomizing the order of contextual information eliminated retrieval-enhanced suggestibility. Therefore, context processing during the post-event information phase influences whether retrieval enhances or reduces eyewitness suggestibility."
https://openalex.org/W2917348443,"Understanding diverse labor market trajectories around vocational rehabilitation provides important insight into potential effectiveness of rehabilitation efforts. We examined factors associated with work participation trajectories before and after vocational rehabilitation.Using nationwide Finnish register data of 7180 vocational rehabilitees, we constructed latent trajectory groups of work participation two years before and two years after their rehabilitation episode starting in 2008-2010. We plotted changes in labor market statuses in these groups and examined other associated factors using multinomial logistic regression.We identified four trajectories based on work participation levels before and after vocational rehabilitation. The ""High-Resumed"" group (35.6%) typically returned to full duties. The ""High-to-Negligible"" group (20.7%) typically transitioned to full disability retirement or unemployment. Among the ""Medium-Resumed"" (25.5%) and ""Longstanding Negligible"" (18.3%) groups, work disability and unemployment were common before rehabilitation, but afterwards those assigned to the former group often returned to full or partial duties. Overall, older age, male gender, living in areas with lower employment rates, having lower education, being employed in the private sector, and having mental diagnoses were associated with the other three trajectories than the most favorable ""High-Resumed"" trajectory. Furthermore, certain industrial sectors, job exposures, and less common diagnoses further separated specific trajectories.Work participation trajectories around vocational rehabilitation are diverse, only partly dependent on initial levels of work participation, and determined by various individual and work-related factors. Future nationwide studies should assess the effectiveness of vocational rehabilitation taking into consideration both individual and work-related factors."
https://openalex.org/W2917938423,"Neuroinflammation plays an important role in the pathogenesis of a range of brain disorders. Non-invasive imaging of neuroinflammation is critical to help improve our understanding of the underlying disease mechanisms, monitor therapies and guide drug development. Generally, MRI lacks specificity to molecular imaging biomarkers, but molecular MR imaging based on chemical exchange saturation transfer (CEST) can potentially detect changes of myoinositol, a putative glial marker that may index neuroinflammation. In this pilot study we aimed to investigate, through validation with immunohistochemistry and in vivo magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), whether CEST imaging can reflect the microglial response to a mild inflammatory challenge with lipopolysaccharide (LPS), in the APPSwe/ PS1 mouse model of Alzheimer's disease and wild type controls. The response to the immune challenge was variable and did not align with genotype. Animals with a strong response to LPS (Iba1+, n = 6) showed an increase in CEST contrast compared with those who did not (Iba1-, n = 6). Changes of myoinositol levels after LPS were not significant. We discuss the difficulties of this mild inflammatory model, the role of myoinositol as a glial biomarker, and the technical challenges of CEST imaging at 0.6ppm."
https://openalex.org/W2915521999,"Microtubule severing, which is highly critical for the survival of both mitotic and post-mitotic cells, has to be precisely adjusted by regulating the expression levels of severing proteins, katanin and spastin. Even though severing mechanism is relatively well-studied, there are limited studies for the transcriptional regulation of microtubule severing proteins. In this study, we identified the main regulatory region of KATNA1 gene encoding katanin-p60 as 5’ UTR, which has a key role for its expression, and showed Elk1 binding to KATNA1. Furthermore, we identified that Elk1 decreased katanin-p60 and spastin protein expressions, while mRNA levels were increased upon Elk1 overexpression. In addition, SUMOylation is a known post-translational modification regulating Elk1 activity. A previous study suggested that K230, K249, K254 amino acids in the R domain are the main SUMOylation sites; however, we identified that these amino acids are neither essential nor substantial for Elk1 SUMOylation. Also, we determined that KATNA1 methylation results in the reduction of Elk1 binding whereas SPG4 methylation does not. Together, our findings emphasizing the impacts of both transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulations of katanin-p60 and spastin suggest that Elk1 has a key role for differential expression patterns of microtubule severing proteins, thereby regulating cellular functions through alterations of microtubule organization."
https://openalex.org/W2916165644,"Heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) is a eukaryotic chaperone responsible for the folding and functional activation of numerous client proteins, many of which are oncoproteins. Thus, Hsp90 inhibition has been intensely pursued, resulting in the development of many potential Hsp90 inhibitors, not all of which are well-characterized. Hsp90 inhibitors not only abrogate its chaperone functions, but also could help us gain insight into the structure–function relationship of this chaperone. Here, using biochemical and cell-based assays along with isothermal titration calorimetry, we investigate KU-32, a derivative of the Hsp90 inhibitor novobiocin (NB), for its ability to modulate Hsp90 chaperone function. Although NB and KU-32 differ only slightly in structure, we found that upon binding, they induce completely opposite conformational changes in Hsp90. We observed that NB and KU-32 both bind to the C-terminal domain of Hsp90, but surprisingly, KU-32 stimulated the chaperone functions of Hsp90 via allosteric modulation of its N-terminal domain, responsible for the chaperone's ATPase activity. In vitro and in silico studies indicated that upon KU-32 binding, Hsp90 undergoes global structural changes leading to the formation of a “partially closed” intermediate that selectively binds ATP and increases ATPase activity. We also report that KU-32 promotes HeLa cell survival and enhances the refolding of an Hsp90 substrate inside the cell. This discovery explains the effectiveness of KU-32 analogs in the management of neuropathies and may facilitate the design of molecules that promote cell survival by enhancing Hsp90 chaperone function and reducing the load of misfolded proteins in cells.

Under stress conditions, Hsp90 and other chaperones are overexpressed to aid in the prevention of apoptosis.

Hence, abrogating Hsp90′s chaperone function has been a major therapeutic paradigm for the treatment of cancer. Alternatively, treatment of the neurodegeneration observed in Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease may require excessive levels or enhanced functionality of the chaperones, due to their cytoprotective role in preventing the accumulation of toxic oligomers like β-amyloid, Tau, and α-synuclein (10Daturpalli S.

Compounds that can inhibit the function of Hsp90 could be considered beneficial for the treatment of cancer, whereas those that can stimulate its function could be considered useful for treating neurodegenerative disorders. Thus, Hsp90 is considered a target for treating both cancer and neurodegenerative disorders. The development and characterization of compounds that modulate Hsp90′s function through either of these mechanisms could be useful in the advancement of existing therapies targeting cancer and neurodegeneration.

Most NTD inhibitors, such as geldanamycin (GA) and radicicol prevent Hsp90 from hydrolyzing ATP by competitively inhibiting the binding of ATP to the NTD of Hsp90 and thereby stall the ATP-dependent Hsp90 protein-folding cycle (12Solárová Z.

Most CTD inhibitors, such as NB, epigallocatechin gallate, and taxol exert their inhibitory effect by allosterically regulating NTD's function, most likely through movement of Hsp90′s middle domain (14Donnelly A.

Some studies claim that the CTD is responsible for Hsp90 dimerization and the binding of many important co-chaperones (14Donnelly A. Blagg B.S.J.

Thus, compounds that bind to the CTD and interfere with these essential functions may be more effective at inhibiting the Hsp90 chaperone machinery than NTD inhibitors.

KU-32′s role in the Hsp90 ATPase cycle was determined using the PK/LDH coupled assay. Binding of KU-32 to human His-tagged recombinant Hsp90 increased ATP turnover rates when compared with the ATPase activity of Hsp90 alone, with the greatest stimulation (∼69%) occurring at 1:1 (Hsp90 monomer/KU-32) molar ratio. At the highest KU-32 concentration of 90 μm, ATPase activity increased by 35% (Table 1 and Fig. S1c). Compared with KU-32, NB exhibited a basal rate of inhibition and reduced the ATPase activity by 40% and ∼50% at its lowest and highest concentrations, respectively (Table 1 and Fig. S1b). GA, a previously reported Hsp90 ATPase inhibitor (29Panaretou B. Prodromou C. Roe S.M. O'Brien R. Ladbury J.E. Piper P.W. Pearl L.H.

Each study was carried out in three different ways: Hsp90 incubated with GA followed by further incubation with either NB or KU-32; Hsp90 incubated with either NB or KU-32 followed by further incubation with GA; and Hsp90 incubated with a mixture containing either GA and NB or GA and KU-32. All three conditions under which GA and NB were combined reduced the ATPase activity by ∼72% and therefore exhibited a slightly greater degree of ATPase inhibition relative to either GA (6 μm) or NB (90 μm) alone (Table 1, Fig. 1 (a and b), and Fig. S1e). Interestingly, KU-32, when combined with GA, interfered with GA-mediated ATPase inhibition and manifested a similar effect as KU-32 alone, exhibiting a 26% increase in the ATPase activity of Hsp90 (Table 1, Fig. 1 (a and b), and Fig. S1d). These observations suggest that NB appeared to partially complement GA-mediated ATPase inhibition, whereas KU-32 appeared to antagonize the inhibitory function of GA. ATP binding is a precursor to ATP hydrolysis; therefore, isothermal titration calorimetry studies were performed to further assist in the interpretation of the results obtained from ATPase experiments. The binding affinities of small-molecule binders of Hsp90 were determined. Binding of KU-32 and GA were enthalpy-driven, whereas the binding of NB was driven by both favorable entropy and favorable enthalpy in almost equal quantities (Table 2 and Fig. 2 (a–c). Binding reactions of ADP and ATP to Hsp90 were primarily enthalpy-driven (Table 2 and Fig. 2 (d and e)). ADP bound Hsp90 with ∼17 times higher affinity as compared with ATP. The enthalpy and Gibbs free energy of ADP binding, respectively, were ∼7.2 times and ∼5.5 times higher than those of ATP binding. This indicates that ADP binds Hsp90 more spontaneously than ATP. To investigate the effect of Hsp90 binders on the binding of ATP to the NTD, ATP was titrated against Hsp90 preincubated with either GA, NB, or KU-32. As expected, GA abrogated ATP binding, as evidenced by an ∼80 times increase in the Kd value (Table 3 and Fig. 3a). The enthalpy and entropy of ATP binding to the Hsp90–GA complex decreased by ∼93 and ∼75%, respectively, as compared with ATP binding to Hsp90 alone. NB has been previously shown to allosterically inhibit ATP binding to the NTD of Hsp90 (16Soti C. Vermes A. Haystead T.A.J. Csermely P.

Our studies also indicate that the Hsp90–NB complex did not bind ATP, as evidenced by a Kd value of ∼3000 μm (Table 3 and Fig. 3b). Conversely, KU-32 did not adversely affect the binding of ATP to Hsp90. In fact, ATP bound the Hsp90–KU-32 complex with an enthalpy-driven affinity very similar to that for Hsp90 alone (Table 3 and Fig. 3c).Table 2Thermodynamic parameters of small molecules binding to Hsp90 aloneCompounds titrated against Hsp90 aloneKdTΔSΔHΔGμmkcal/molkcal/molkcal/molGA0.25 α 0.010.42 α 0.02−4.06 α 0.10−4.48 α 0.12NB1.01 α 0.020.61 α 0.03−0.90 α 0.01−1.51 α 0.04KU-320.21 α 0.040.29 α 0.02−4.9 α 0.30−5.19 α 0.32ATP41.2 α 3.500.39 α 0.02−1.39 α 0.25−1.78 α 0.27ADP2.38 α 0.04−0.2 α 0.02−10 α 0.97−9.80 α 0.95 Open table in a new tab Table 3Thermodynamic parameters of ATP binding to Hsp90–small molecule complexesHsp90–compound complex titrated against ATPKdTΔSΔHΔGμmkcal/molkcal/molkcal/molHsp90 + GA3333.3 α 19.60.1 α 0.01−0.1 α 0.07−0.23 α 0.08Hsp90 + NB2879 α 17.40.14 α 0.03−0.12 α 0.02−0.26 α 0.05Hsp90 + KU-32a,#36.8 α 2.160.38 α 0.02−1.51 α 0.23−1.89 α 0.25Hsp90 + GA + NB104 α 1200.21 α 0.02−0.09 α 0.01−0.30 α 0.03Hsp90 + GA + KU-32b,#50 α 3.450.38 α 0.03−1.41 α 0.02−1.79 α 0.05 Open table in a new tab Figure 3ATP titration against Hsp90 bound to individual compounds and their combinations. 1 mm ATP was titrated against 30 μm recombinant human Hsp90β preincubated with 30 μm GA (a), 30 μm NB (b), 30 μm KU-32 (c), 30 μm GA and 30 μm NB (d), and 30 μm GA and 30 μm KU-32 (e).

In accordance with our ATPase results, ATP bound the Hsp90–GA–KU-32 complex with an enthalpy-driven affinity similar to that of the Hsp90–KU-32 complex (Table 3 and Fig. 3e). ATP titration against a Hsp90–GA–NB complex showed further reduction in ATP binding with respect to the Hsp90–GA and Hsp90–NB complexes (Table 3 and Fig. 3d). This binding event was entropy-driven with little contribution from enthalpy and indicated the formation of a random state that does not favor ATP binding. Taken together, these observations suggest that NB and GA act as inhibitors of chaperone function by preventing ATP binding and subsequent hydrolysis. Furthermore, they appear to behave as agonists as our ATPase results had previously indicated. Additionally, ATP-binding affinities for the Hsp90–KU-32 and Hsp90–GA–KU-32 complexes suggest that KU-32 binding induces conformational changes in the NTD of Hsp90 that favor the binding of ATP but not GA. Titration studies were carried out to enhance our understanding of the ATPase results (obtained when compounds were sequentially incubated with Hsp90) and to investigate whether the binding of one compound to the CTD of Hsp90 allosterically modulated the binding of a second compound to the NTD and vice versa. The binding affinity of GA for the Hsp90–KU-32 complex was drastically reduced as compared with Hsp90 alone (Kd of 52.9 μm versus 0.25 μm). The binding event exhibited both unfavorable entropy (∼340%) and enthalpy (∼60%) as compared with the binding of GA to Hsp90 alone (Table 4 and Fig. S2a). KU-32 and NB both bound the Hsp90–GA complex with reduced affinities compared with Hsp90 alone, as evidenced by the Kd values of 4 and 10 μm, respectively. These binding reactions were both entirely enthalpy-driven (Table 4 and Figs. S2b and S3a). The binding affinity of GA for the Hsp90–NB complex was drastically reduced as compared with Hsp90 alone (Kd of ∼30 μm versus 0.25 μm, respectively). The binding event was enthalpy-driven, and both ΔG and ΔH were reduced as compared with the binding reaction of GA to Hsp90 alone (Table 4 and Fig. S3b). NB and KU-32 reduced the binding affinity of GA by ∼120 and ∼200 times, respectively, whereas GA reduced the binding affinities of NB and KU-32 by ∼10 and ∼20 times, respectively. These observations indicated negative allosteric cross-talk between both of the Hsp90′s termini, with the function of NTD being more strongly regulated by the CTD.Table 4Thermodynamic parameters of NTD and CTD binders binding to various Hsp90–NTD or Hsp90–CTD complexesCompounds titrated against other Hsp90–compound complexesKdTΔSΔHΔGμmkcal/molkcal/molkcal/molGAc/NB9.9 α 0.740.14 α 0.03−5.2 α 0.67−5.34 α 0.07NBc/GA30.1 α 6.80−0.03 α 0.01−0.96 α 0.09−0.93 α 0.09KU-32c/GA52.9 α 6.35−0.99 α 0.08−1.76 α 0.20−0.77 α 0.12GAc/KU-324.03 α 0.620.003−7.31 α 0.94−7.31 α 0.94KU-32c/NB102.5 α 3.60−0.9 α 0.10−1.07 α 0.14−0.17 α 0.04 Open table in a new tab ADP release is essential for Hsp90 to re-enter its catalytic cycle following ATP hydrolysis, and hence, we wanted to determine whether KU-32 played a role in ADP binding and its subsequent release. ADP binding to the Hsp90–KU-32 complex was enthalpy-driven and manifested an increase in the Kd value (10 μm) as compared with ADP binding to Hsp90 alone (Table 5 and Fig. 4a). Reduced binding affinity of ADP to Hsp90 might have an impact on ATP binding to the Hsp90–KU-32–ADP complex and could indirectly indicate ADP release. ATP bound the Hsp90–KU-32–ADP complex with ∼7 times higher affinity as compared with Hsp90 alone. The binding reaction was enthalpy-driven, and the thermodynamic parameters of binding were similar to ATP binding to Hsp90 alone (Table 5 and Fig. 4b). This indicates that the conformation of the Hsp90 NTD in complex with KU-32 favors ADP release and subsequent ATP binding.Table 5Thermodynamic parameters of adenosine nucleotides binding to Hsp90–small molecule complexesHsp90–compound complex+ADP+ATPKdTΔSΔHΔGKdTΔSΔHΔGμmkcal/molkcal/molkcal/molμmkcal/molkcal/molkcal/mol(Hsp90 + KU-32)#10 α 1−0.69 α 0.04−15.9 α 1.70−15.21 α 1.66(Hsp90 + KU-32) + ADP5.65 α 0.480.50 α 0.07−1.20 α 0.26−1.70 α 0.17(Hsp90 + GA)(Hsp90 + NB)#10.1 α 1.33−0.33 α 0.03−10.7 α 0.65−10.37 α 0.62(Hsp90 + GA)3.23 α 0.460.33 α 0.05−3.6 α 0.45−3.93 α 0.50 Open table in a new tab Additional titration experiments were carried out to study the effect of Hsp90 inhibitors GA and NB on ADP binding to the NTD of Hsp90 and determine whether they modulate the binding of ADP and ATP differently. ADP at a concentration of 0.15 mm was unable to bind the Hsp90–GA complex (Table 5 and Fig. S4a). This observation is in accordance with the fact that the binding affinity of GA to the NTD of Hsp90 is higher than that of ADP. However, ADP was able to bind the Hsp90–GA complex when titrated at a concentration of 1 mm (Table 5 and Fig. S4b). The reaction was enthalpy-driven, and ADP bound the Hsp90–GA complex with a similar affinity as compared with ADP binding to Hsp90 alone. This could happen when the difference in concentration between two ligands (ADP and GA) sharing the same binding site far exceeds the difference in their Kd value. This means that even though the binding affinity of GA to Hsp90 is ∼10 times higher than that of ADP, a ∼30 times excess of ADP can displace GA from its binding site. To determine whether the CTD inhibitor NB allosterically affects ADP binding to the NTD of Hsp90, a preformed Hsp90–NB complex was titrated against 1 mm ADP. ADP was able to bind the Hsp90–NB complex with a slightly reduced binding affinity as compared with ADP binding to Hsp90 alone (Kd ∼10 μm). The binding was enthalpy-driven, and the thermodynamic parameters of binding were observed to be similar to those of ADP titrated against the Hsp90–KU-32 complex (Table 5 an"

Our understanding of how the characteristics of the pressure profile of shock waves, such as peak pressure and pulse duration, influences membrane properties is limited. Here we study the response of lipid bilayer membranes to shock pulses with different pressure profiles using atomistic molecular dynamics simulations. From our simulation results, we find that the transient deformation/disordering of the membrane depends on both the magnitude and the pulse duration of the pressure profile of the shock pulse. For a low pressure impulse, peak pressure has a dominant effect on membrane structural changes, while for the high pressure impulse, we find that there exists an optimal pulse duration at which membrane deformation/disordering is maximized."
https://openalex.org/W2915555747,"Disturbance regimes have a major influence on the baseline carbon that characterizes any particular ecosystem. Often regimes result in lower average regional baseline C (compared to those same systems if the disturbance processes were lessened/removed). However, in infrequently disturbed systems the role of disturbance as a ""background"" process that influences broad-scale, baseline C levels is often neglected. Long-term chronosequences suggest disturbances in these systems may serve to increase regional biomass C stocks by maintaining productivity. However, that inference has not been tested spatially. Here, the large forested system of southeast Alaska, USA, is utilized to 1) estimate baseline regional C stocks, 2) test the fundamental disturbance-ecosystem C relationship, 3) estimate the cumulative impact of disturbances on baseline C. Using 1491 ground points with carbon measurements and a novel way of mapping disturbance regimes, the relationship between total biomass C, disturbance exposure, and climate was analyzed statistically. A spatial model was created to determine regional C and compare different disturbance scenarios. In this infrequently disturbed ecosystem, higher disturbance exposure is correlated with higher biomass C, supporting the hypothesis that disturbances maintain productivity at broad scales. The region is estimated to potentially contain a baseline 1.21-1.52 Pg biomass C (when unmanaged). Removal of wind and landslides from the model resulted in lower net C stocks (-2 to -19% reduction), though the effect was heterogeneous on finer scales. There removal of landslides alone had a larger effect then landslide and wind combined removal. The relationship between higher disturbance exposure and higher biomass within the broad ecosystem (which, on average, has a very low disturbance frequency) suggest that disturbances can serve maintain higher levels of productivity in infrequently disturbed but very C dense ecosystems. Carbon research in other systems, especially those where disturbances are infrequent relative to successional processes, should consider the role of disturbances in maintaining baseline ecosystem productivity."

Due to its limited ocular bioavailability, topical formulations are not available yet. This study introduces within the framework of nanotechnology three nanopreparations of acetozolamide for topical application, one of them is liposomal phospholipid vehicle and the other two preparations are propolis and Punica granatum (pomegranate). The hypotensive effect of these different nanopreparations in lowering the increased intraocular pressure that was induced in experimental rabbits is monitored for 130 hrs. Structural characteristics of the optic nerve dissected from all involved groups were studied by Fourier transfrom infrared spectroscopy. The obtained results indicate the impact of the topically applied acetozolamide nanopreparations in lowering the intraocular pressure to its normotensive control value. On the other hand, the optic nerve characteristics were found to be dependent on the way acetozolamide introduced. Glaucoma affects structural components that contain OH group and increases β-turns of the protein secondary structure while, reducing the content of both α-helix and Turns. In the same context, liposomal-acetozolamide and propolis nanopreparations protecting the optic nerve protein secondary structure from these changes associated with glaucoma."

The assessment was based on the standardized methodology of the Rapid Assessment of Avoidable Blindness and Diabetic Retinopathy, a population-based survey for blindness and visual impairment. From 3,255 eligible subjects, 76.6% were examined. The adjusted prevalence of bilateral blindness [presenting visual acuity (VA) in the better eye of less than 3/60] was 1.7% (95% confidence interval, 1.2%–2.2%), with avoidable causes (treatable and preventable) accounting for 68.8% of cases. The main causes of blindness were cataract (52.1%), glaucoma (6.3%), and diabetic retinopathy (6.3%); these data were similar to those for other neighboring countries. Cataract surgical coverage (CSC) in the survey area was estimated as 88.9% for individuals with blindness (VA, <3/60), 76.6% for those with a VA of <6/60, and 60.3% for those with a VA of <6/18. The most common barriers against cataract surgery in individuals with a best-corrected VA of ≤6/60 included “need not felt” (48.8%) and “fear” (14.6%). Among individuals with a past history of cataract surgery, only 57.1% showed a “good” or “very good” outcome (VA, ≥6/18). Finally, 23.5% individuals with known or newly diagnosed diabetes showed retinopathy and/or maculopathy, with 6.2% exhibiting sight-threatening diabetic retinopathy (proliferative retinopathy, referable maculopathy, or both). Our findings indicate the need to overcome barriers against surgery for cataract, which is the main cause of avoidable blindness, to increase CSC, and to improve surgical outcomes. Moreover, improved methods for diabetic retinopathy screening can ensure prompt identification of patients with a risk of blindness. Glaucoma screening is also necessary for areas with a high prevalence."

It consists of counseling for at least 10 minutes, an individualized prescription of tobacco cessation treatment and follow-up on at least one occasion. TCP is currently being tested in clinical practice for the first time but there is a lack of knowledge about how it is perceived by health care providers.To explore PHC provider's perceived barriers and facilitators of implementing TCP as an intervention targeting a context with socioeconomically disadvantaged groups in Sweden.Directed content analysis of transcripts from eight semi-structured interviews and one focus group interview with PHC providers with personal experience of TCP as informants. Data collection and analysis was guided by The Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research.Perceived facilitators of implementing TCP were increased self-efficacy among the informants and involvement in the treatment among patients, which led to more intensive counseling and advice being taken more seriously by patients. Lack of resources, routines, and collaboration to work with tobacco cessation and lack of knowledge, motivation and self-efficacy among colleagues were perceived as barriers. Motivation and self-efficacy to quit was perceived as low among some patients, which was explained by low social support to quit, negative attitude and low adherence to treatment and tobacco being used as a coping strategy for life stress. Access to treatment for patients was limited by cost of treatment, long waiting times and focus on face-to-face counseling.TCP was perceived positively by the informants but access to treatment for patients was partly limited by how tobacco cessation services were organized. Lack of structural support, resources and differing attitudes among PHC providers need to be addressed to facilitate its implementation."
https://openalex.org/W2916721787,"Background Eye-drop administration errors occur in the majority of patients and increase the risk for treatment failure or systemic adverse events. While lacking knowledge is the principal error cause, most patients overestimate their skills and are unaware of often substantial knowledge gaps. Therefore, the impact of including motivational patient education on long-term eye-drop administration skills of patients was investigated. Methods This is a cluster-randomized controlled trial in German community pharmacies. Patient education in both groups comprised observation of the patient during eye-drop administration to identify individual errors, pharmaceutical counseling, and teach-back evaluation of the training. In the intervention group, motivational communication techniques were included to increase error awareness and readiness for patient education. In addition, intervention patients were trained on repeated errors until administration was performed correctly. In contrast, patients in the control group only received feedback on erroneous administration steps without another assessment and reinforced training. Results In total, 152 adult patients were eligible to the study and 91 patients (intervention group N = 46) agreed to participate in a 1-month, 6-month, and 12-month follow-up. Patient education significantly increased the proportion of patients correctly administering eye-drops from 6% (7 out of 56 intervention patients, 1 out of 82 control patients) at baseline to 35% (12 out of 30 intervention patients, 12 out of 39 control patients, p ≤ 0.001) at the 1-month follow-up, and 64% (11 out of 15 intervention patients, 17 out of 29 control patients, p ≤ 0.001) at the 6-month follow-up irrespective of group allocation. In some patients previously resolved errors recurred during follow-up visits. This emphasizes the need for periodical reevaluation of patient administration skills and the provision of prevention strategies besides education. Conclusion Patient education that included demonstration of administration skills and verbal and written counseling on observed errors improved eye-drop administration skills irrespective of the communication technique applied. Whereof, high drop-out rates limited the power to detect a difference between groups. In particular, periodic demonstration of administration skills seemed important for sustainable improvement of administration skills. However, further error prevention strategies such as additional education materials or support by a caregiver may be necessary in some patients."

https://openalex.org/W2917251474,"Purpose Normalized emphysema score is a protocol-robust CT biomarker of mortality. We aimed to improve mortality prediction by including the emphysema score progression rate–its change over time–into the models. Method and materials CT scans from 6000 National Lung Screening Trial CT arm participants were included. Of these, 1810 died (445 lung cancer-specific). The remaining 4190 survivors were sampled with replacement up to 24432 to approximate the full cohort. Three overlapping subcohorts were formed which required participants to have images from specific screening rounds. Emphysema scores were obtained after resampling, normalization, and bullae cluster analysis of the original images. Base models contained solely the latest emphysema score. Progression models included emphysema score progression rate. Models were adjusted by including baseline age, sex, BMI, smoking status, smoking intensity, smoking duration, and previous COPD diagnosis. Cox proportional hazard models predicting all-cause and lung cancer mortality were compared by calculating the area under the curve per year follow-up. Results In the subcohort of participants with baseline and first annual follow-up scans, the analysis was performed on 4940 participants (23227 after resampling). Area under the curve for all-cause mortality predictions of the base and progression models 6 years after baseline were 0.564 (0.564 to 0.565) and 0.569 (0.568 to 0.569) when unadjusted, and 0.704 (0.703 to 0.704) to 0.705 (0.704 to 0.705) when adjusted. The respective performances predicting lung cancer mortality were 0.638 (0.637 to 0.639) and 0.643 (0.642 to 0.644) when unadjusted, and 0.724 (0.723 to 0.725) and 0.725 (0.725 to 0.726) when adjusted. Conclusion Including emphysema score progression rate into risk models shows no clinically relevant improvement in mortality risk prediction. This is because scan normalization does not adjust for an overall change in lung density. Adjusting for changes in smoking behavior is likely required to make this a clinically useful measure of emphysema progression."

On the 28th day after the operation, CRC growth and liver metastasis were assessed by morphology, the changes in the expression of HIF-1α (hypoxia inducible factor-1α), stromal cell-derived factor-1 alpha (SDF-1α), CXCR4 (C-X-C chemokine receptor type 4), PI3K, and Akt in the transplanted tumor and SDF-1α and CXCR4 in the liver were detected by Western blot and immunohistochemistry. The protein contents of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2, and collagen IV in the serum and transplanted tumor and SDF-1α and CXCR4 in liver tissues were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. In the Capecitabine and high dose CLG groups, the growth and liver metastasis of CRC were significantly inhibited, the protein levels of HIF-1α, SDF-1α, CXCR4, MMP-2, VEGF, PI3K, Akt, P-PI3K and P-Akt in the transplanted tumor were lower, while the content of collagen IV in the transplanted tumor was higher, than in Model group. A high dose of CLG inhibited the growth of transplanted tumor and liver metastasis of CRC in nude mice, probably by inhibiting the HIF-1α/SDF-1α-CXCR4/PI3K-Akt signaling pathway reducing the synthesis and release of VEGF and degradation of collagen IV."

Moreover, no one has empirically examined whether the relationship between BW, obesogenic behaviors and BMI along the full low-to-high birthweight continuum reflects the U-shape pattern expected from common risk at both BW extremes. Our objective was to characterize physical activity, screen time, and eating behavior and their relationship to BMI as a function of BW among school-aged boys and girls. In this cross-sectional study, 460 children aged 6 to 12 years (50% boys) from Montreal, Canada provided information on sleeping time, screen time, physical activity levels, eating behavior (emotional, external and restrained eating) and anthropometrics (height, weight, BW) through parent reported questionnaires. BMI was normalized using WHO Standards (zBMI), and BW expressed as ratio using Canadian population standards (BW for gestational age and sex). Analyses were conducted using generalized linear models with linear and quadratic terms for BW, stratified by sex and adjusted for age, ethnicity and household income. In boys, physical activity and screen time showed U-shaped associations with BW, while physical activity had an inverted U-shaped in girls. Emotional and restrained eating had positive linear relations with BW in boys and girls. Sleep time and external eating were not associated with BW. A U-shaped relationship between BW and zBMI was found in boys but no association was found in girls. Only sleep (in boys and girls), and emotional eating (girls only) were related to zBMI and mediation of the BW-zBMI relationship was only supported for emotional eating. In conclusion, BW relates to obesogenic behaviors and BMI in both non-linear and linear ways, and these associations differed by sex."

Within the PSI group, higher level of fasting plasma glucose was significantly associated with the reduced incidence of hyperuricemia in PSI population (RR: 0.40, 95% CI: 0.26-0.63). For females, hypertension, increased levels of serum creatinine and triglycerides were the risk factors for incident hyperuricemia in the PSI group.Our results suggest that PSI is significantly associated with the lower incidence of hyperuricemia. Moreover, elevated fasting plasma glucose might prevent the onset of hyperuricemia in PSI population."

I was just a few months into a new job as manager of a graduate school, sitting in my first doctoral student recruitment board meeting. The faculty members and I were discussing the candidates we had interviewed. One hadn't hidden the fact that she wished to leave her current Ph.D. position to join our program, and some of the faculty members worried this might be a bad sign, indicating a lack of commitment. I argued that such a decision is not taken lightly and, depending on the circumstances, can indicate strength of character rather than failure. I hadn't planned to bring up my personal experience, but it felt like the right time.

> “Who would ever take me on as a doctoral student after I had walked out like that?” 

Twenty years earlier, I had enthusiastically embarked on my own Ph.D. journey in the lab of a well-known professor. But the lab culture was bad from the start. The default mode seemed to be blaming the new guy for whatever went wrong. I was shouted at for breaking a piece of equipment I had never used—and several other times for no valid reason. I tried to focus on my work. For 3 months, every morning I built myself up with all the motivation I could muster, only to return home each night deflated and drained.

I wondered whether I just needed to toughen up. Working at the leading edge of science was sure to be demanding, after all. Friends and family members in whom I confided suggested, all with good intentions, that the challenges I was experiencing might be part of a normal transition from the relatively structured life of an undergraduate student toward academic independence. It was hard to recognize what now appears obvious: The conditions in the lab were unacceptable.

One evening, on the way home after another shouting incident, what I thought was an itch on my cheek turned out to be tears streaming down my face. I knew then that enough was enough. After a sleepless night and against the “better” judgment of others, I announced my immediate departure. As I left, I thanked a colleague for his support. “That is brave,” he said. A few months later, I learned he too had resigned. I also discovered that my predecessor as a Ph.D. student in the lab had left after 1 year due to burnout.

I worked menial jobs to make ends meet, not sure of the way forward. I was still interested in pursuing research, but my enthusiasm had taken a major hit and I felt like damaged goods. Who would ever take me on as a doctoral student after I had walked out like that? An application to work in another lab proved unsuccessful, though I can't say whether this was because of my tarnished record or because my heart was not quite in it anymore.

I was lucky. My former master's degree supervisor came to my aid and arranged a short stint for me to work as a research assistant in a collaborator's lab. I embraced the opportunity to discover a new country and found a team of jovial colleagues with an enthusiastic group leader who helped me regain my passion for research. In the meantime, my master's supervisor was granted funding for a Ph.D. student and offered me the position. I had been given a second chance. I went on to obtain my Ph.D., complete a postdoc, work as a lecturer, and run my own lab before moving to my current position.

At the recruitment meeting, someone mentioned that a former principal investigator from our candidate's current department had recently taken a position at a nearby research institute. By coincidence, I had met him just a few days earlier. The board agreed that I should get in touch with him to ask whether a student might have a legitimate reason to leave that department. His answer: “I consider that very likely.”

Walking out of my first Ph.D. project was the most difficult and most important decision of my professional life. Young academics making such a tough call ought to be recognized for their resolve more often than I fear they are. I am glad that our recruitment board did.
