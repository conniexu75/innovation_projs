https://openalex.org/W2060130170,"The skin represents the primary interface between the host and the environment. This organ is also home to trillions of microorganisms that play an important role in tissue homeostasis and local immunity. Skin microbial communities are highly diverse and can be remodelled over time or in response to environmental challenges. How, in the context of this complexity, individual commensal microorganisms may differentially modulate skin immunity and the consequences of these responses for tissue physiology remains unclear. Here we show that defined commensals dominantly affect skin immunity and identify the cellular mediators involved in this specification. In particular, colonization with Staphylococcus epidermidis induces IL-17A(+) CD8(+) T cells that home to the epidermis, enhance innate barrier immunity and limit pathogen invasion. Commensal-specific T-cell responses result from the coordinated action of skin-resident dendritic cell subsets and are not associated with inflammation, revealing that tissue-resident cells are poised to sense and respond to alterations in microbial communities. This interaction may represent an evolutionary means by which the skin immune system uses fluctuating commensal signals to calibrate barrier immunity and provide heterologous protection against invasive pathogens. These findings reveal that the skin immune landscape is a highly dynamic environment that can be rapidly and specifically remodelled by encounters with defined commensals, findings that have profound implications for our understanding of tissue-specific immunity and pathologies."
https://openalex.org/W2080620471,"Mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (MSCs) are promising cell sources for regenerative therapies due to their multipotency and ready availability, but their application can be complicated by patient-specific factors like age or illness. MSCs have been investigated for the treatment of many musculoskeletal disorders, including osteoarthritis and osteoporosis. Due to the prevalence of these diseases in older populations, researchers have studied how aging affects MSC properties and have found that proliferation and differentiation potential are impaired. However, these effects have never been compared among MSCs isolated from multiple tissue sources in the same, healthy donor. Revealing differences in how MSCs are affected by age could help identify an optimal cell source for musculoskeletal therapies targeting older patients. MSCs were isolated from young and old rabbit bone marrow, muscle, and adipose tissue. Cell yield and viability were quantified after isolation procedures, and expansion properties were assessed using assays for proliferation, senescence, and colony formation. Multipotency was also examined using lineage-specific stains and spectrophotometry of metabolites. Results were compared between age groups and among MSC sources. Results showed that MSCs are differentially influenced by aging, with bone marrow-derived stem cells having impaired proliferation, senescence, and chondrogenic response, whereas muscle-derived stem cells and adipose-derived stem cells exhibited no negative effects. While age reduced overall cell yield and adipogenic potential of all MSC populations, osteogenesis and clonogenicity remained unchanged. These findings indicate the importance of age as a factor when designing cell-based therapies for older patients."
https://openalex.org/W2030556188,"The ages of the most common stars - low-mass (cool) stars like the Sun, and smaller - are difficult to derive because traditional dating methods use stellar properties that either change little as the stars age or are hard to measure. The rotation rates of all cool stars decrease substantially with time as the stars steadily lose their angular momenta. If properly calibrated, rotation therefore can act as a reliable determinant of their ages based on the method of gyrochronology. To calibrate gyrochronology, the relationship between rotation period and age must be determined for cool stars of different masses, which is best accomplished with rotation period measurements for stars in clusters with well-known ages. Hitherto, such measurements have been possible only in clusters with ages of less than about one billion years, and gyrochronology ages for older stars have been inferred from model predictions. Here we report rotation period measurements for 30 cool stars in the 2.5-billion-year-old cluster NGC 6819. The periods reveal a well-defined relationship between rotation period and stellar mass at the cluster age, suggesting that ages with a precision of order 10 per cent can be derived for large numbers of cool Galactic field stars."
https://openalex.org/W2059678074,"Meiotic recombination is a critical step in gametogenesis for many organisms, enabling the creation of genetically diverse haploid gametes. In each meiotic cell, recombination is initiated by numerous DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) created by Spo11, the evolutionarily conserved topoisomerase-like protein, but how these DSBs are distributed relatively uniformly across the four chromatids that make up each chromosome pair is poorly understood. Here we employ Saccharomyces cerevisiae to demonstrate distance-dependent DSB interference in cis (in which the occurrence of a DSB suppresses adjacent DSB formation)--a process that is mediated by the conserved DNA damage response kinase, Tel1(ATM). The inhibitory function of Tel1 acts on a relatively local scale, while over large distances DSBs have a tendency to form independently of one another even in the presence of Tel1. Notably, over very short distances, loss of Tel1 activity causes DSBs to cluster within discrete zones of concerted DSB activity. Our observations support a hierarchical view of recombination initiation where Tel1(ATM) prevents clusters of DSBs, and further suppresses DSBs within the surrounding chromosomal region. Such collective negative regulation will help to ensure that recombination events are dispersed evenly and arranged optimally for genetic exchange and efficient chromosome segregation."
https://openalex.org/W2017985095,"Cancer is a leading cause of death worldwide. Cancer cells proliferate uncontrollably and, many cases, spread to other parts of the body. A protein historically involved in cancer is protein kinase CK2. CK2 is a serine-threonine kinase that has been involved in cell growth, cell proliferation and cell apoptosis. CK2 functions as an oncogene when overexpressed in mouse tissues, and can synergize with known oncogenes, such as ras, to induce cell transformation in cells in culture. CK2, typically the CK2α protein, is found elevated in a number of human tumors. However, we have little information on CK2α' and CK2β proteins, and scarce information on CK2 gene transcript expression. Here, we explore the expression of CK2 transcripts in primary tumor tissues using the database Oncomine in the six cancers with the highest mortality in the U.S.A. In addition, we studied the correlation between CK2 expression and overall survival using the Kaplan-Meier Plotter database in breast, ovarian, and lung cancers. We found widespread upregulation in the expression of CK2 genes in primary tumor tissues. However, we found underexpression of CK2α' transcripts in some tumors, increased CK2β transcripts in some invasive tumors, and deregulation of CK2 transcripts in some tumor precursors. There was also correlation between CK2 expression levels and patient survival. These data provides additional evidence for CK2 as a biomarker for cancer studies and as a target for cancer therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2315828900,"Our previous in vitro studies have identified hepatocyte nuclear factor 1α (HNF1α) as an obligated trans-activator for PCSK9 gene expression and demonstrated its functional involvement in the suppression of PCSK9 expression by berberine (BBR), a natural cholesterol-lowering compound. In this study, we investigated the mechanism underlying the inhibitory effect of BBR on HNF1α-mediated PCSK9 transcription. Administration of BBR to hyperlipidemic mice and hamsters lowered circulating PCSK9 concentrations and hepatic PCSK9 mRNA levels without affecting the gene expression of HNF1α. However, hepatic HNF1α protein levels were markedly reduced in BBR-treated animals as compared with the control. Using HepG2 cells as a model system, we obtained evidence that BBR treatment let to accelerated degradation of HNF1α protein. By applying inhibitors to selectively block the ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS) and autophagy-lysosomal pathway, we show that HNF1α protein content in HepG2 cells was not affected by bafilomycin A1 treatment, but it was dose-dependently increased by UPS inhibitors bortezomib and MG132. Bortezomib treatment elevated HNF1α and PCSK9 cellular levels with concomitant reductions of LDL receptor protein. Moreover, HNF1α protein displayed a multiubiquitination ladder pattern in cells treated with BBR or overexpressing ubiquitin. By expressing GFP-HNF1α fusion protein in cells, we observed that blocking UPS resulted in accumulation of GFP-HNF1α in cytoplasm. Importantly, we show that the BBR reducing effects on HNF1α protein and PCSK9 gene transcription can be eradicated by proteasome inhibitors. Altogether, our studies using BBR as a probe uncovered a new aspect of PCSK9 regulation by ubiquitin-induced proteasomal degradation of HNF1α."

https://openalex.org/W2034420332,"Bladder cancer (BCa) is a common malignancy worldwide and has a high probability of recurrence after initial diagnosis and treatment. As a result, recurrent surveillance, primarily involving repeated cystoscopies, is a critical component of post diagnosis patient management. Since cystoscopy is invasive, expensive and a possible deterrent to patient compliance with regular follow-up screening, new non-invasive technologies to aid in the detection of recurrent and/or primary bladder cancer are strongly needed. In this study, mass spectrometry based metabolomics was employed to identify biochemical signatures in human urine that differentiate bladder cancer from non-cancer controls. Over 1000 distinct compounds were measured including 587 named compounds of known chemical identity. Initial biomarker identification was conducted using a 332 subject sample set of retrospective urine samples (cohort 1), which included 66 BCa positive samples. A set of 25 candidate biomarkers was selected based on statistical significance, fold difference and metabolic pathway coverage. The 25 candidate biomarkers were tested against an independent urine sample set (cohort 2) using random forest analysis, with palmitoyl sphingomyelin, lactate, adenosine and succinate providing the strongest predictive power for differentiating cohort 2 cancer from non-cancer urines. Cohort 2 metabolite profiling revealed additional metabolites, including arachidonate, that were higher in cohort 2 cancer vs. non-cancer controls, but were below quantitation limits in the cohort 1 profiling. Metabolites related to lipid metabolism may be especially interesting biomarkers. The results suggest that urine metabolites may provide a much needed non-invasive adjunct diagnostic to cystoscopy for detection of bladder cancer and recurrent disease management."
https://openalex.org/W2049024180,"Background The HIV cascade of care (cascade) is a comprehensive tool which identifies attrition along the HIV care continuum. We executed analyses to explicate heterogeneity in the cascade across key strata, as well as identify predictors of attrition across stages of the cascade. Methods Using linked individual-level data for the population of HIV-positive individuals in BC, we considered the 2011 calendar year, including individuals diagnosed at least 6 months prior, and excluding individuals that died or were lost to follow-up before January 1st, 2011. We defined five stages in the cascade framework: HIV ‘diagnosed’, ‘linked’ to care, ‘retained’ in care, ‘on HAART’ and virologically ‘suppressed’. We stratified the cascade by sex, age, risk category, and regional health authority. Finally, multiple logistic regression models were built to predict attrition across each stage of the cascade, adjusting for stratification variables. Results We identified 7621 HIV diagnosed individuals during the study period; 80% were male and 5% were <30, 17% 30–39, 37% 40–49 and 40% were ≥50 years. Of these, 32% were MSM, 28% IDU, 8% MSM/IDU, 12% heterosexual, and 20% other. Overall, 85% of individuals ‘on HAART’ were ‘suppressed’; however, this proportion ranged from 60%–93% in our various stratifications. Most individuals, in all subgroups, were lost between the stages: ‘linked’ to ‘retained’ and ‘on HAART’ to ‘suppressed’. Subgroups with the highest attrition between these stages included females and individuals <30 years (regardless of transmission risk group). IDUs experienced the greatest attrition of all subgroups. Logistic regression results found extensive statistically significant heterogeneity in attrition across the cascade between subgroups and regional health authorities. Conclusions We found that extensive heterogeneity in attrition existed across subgroups and regional health authorities along the HIV cascade of care in B.C., Canada. Our results provide critical information to optimize engagement in care and health service delivery."
https://openalex.org/W1999582448,"Background Chikungunya is an Aedes -borne disease characterised by febrile arthralgia and responsible for massive outbreaks. We present a prospective clinical cohort study and a retrospective serological study relating to a CHIK outbreak, in the Republic of Congo in 2011. Methodology and Findings We analysed 317 suspected cases, of which 308 (97.2%) lived in the city of Brazzaville (66.6% in the South area). Amongst them, 37 (11.7%) were CHIKV+ve patients (i.e., biologically confirmed by a real-time RT-PCR assay), of whom 36 (97.3%) had fever, 22 (66.7%) myalgia and 32 (86.5%) arthralgia. All tested negative for dengue. The distribution of incident cases within Brazzaville districts was compared with CHIKV seroprevalence before the outbreak (34.4% in 517 blood donors), providing evidence for previous circulation of CHIKV. We applied a CHIK clinical score to 126 patients recruited within the two first day of illness (including 28 CHIKV+ves (22.2%)) with sensitivity (78.6%) and specificity (72.4%) values comparing with those of the referent study in Reunion Island. The negative predictive value was high (92%), but the positive predictive value (45%) indicate poor potential contribution to medical practice to identify CHIKV+ve patients in low prevalence outbreaks. However, the score allowed a slightly more accurate follow-up of the evolution of the outbreak than the criterion ""fever+arthralgia"". The complete sequencing of a Congolase isolate (Brazza_MRS1) demonstrated belonging to the East/Central/South African lineage and was further used for producing a robust genome-scale CHIKV phylogenetic analysis. Conclusions/Significance We describe the first Chikungunya outbreak declared in the Republic of Congo. The seroprevalence study conducted amongst blood donors before outbreak provided evidence for previous CHIKV circulation. We suggest that a more systematic survey of the entomological situation and of arbovirus circulation is necessary in Central Africa for better understanding the environmental, microbiological and sociological determinants of emergence."
https://openalex.org/W2011255805,"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is an aggressive tumor, with a high mortality rate due to late symptom presentation and frequent tumor recurrences and metastasis. It is also a rapidly growing tumor supported by different metabolic mechanisms; nevertheless, the biological and molecular mechanisms involved in the metabolic reprogramming in HCC are unclear. In this study, we found that pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) was frequently over-expressed in human HCCs and its over-expression was associated with aggressive clinicopathological features and poor prognosis of HCC patients. Furthermore, knockdown of PKM2 suppressed aerobic glycolysis and cell proliferation in HCC cell lines in vitro. Importantly, knockdown of PKM2 hampered HCC growth in both subcutaneous injection and orthotopic liver implantation models, and reduced lung metastasis in vivo. Of significance, PKM2 over-expression in human HCCs was associated with a down-regulation of a liver-specific microRNA, miR-122. We further showed that miR-122 interacted with the 3UTR of the PKM2 gene. Re-expression of miR-122 in HCC cell lines reduced PKM2 expression, decreased glucose uptake in vitro, and suppressed HCC tumor growth in vivo. Our clinical data and functional studies have revealed a novel biological mechanism involved in HCC metabolic reprogramming."
https://openalex.org/W2053334642,"GPR120 (Ffar4) has been postulated to represent an important receptor mediating the improved metabolic profile seen upon ingestion of a diet enriched in polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs). GPR120 is highly expressed in the digestive system, adipose tissue, lung and macrophages and also present in the endocrine pancreas. A new Gpr120 deficient mouse model on pure C57bl/6N background was developed to investigate the importance of the receptor for long-term feeding with a diet enriched with fish oil. Male Gpr120 deficient mice were fed two different high fat diets (HFDs) for 18 weeks. The diets contained lipids that were mainly saturated (SAT) or mainly n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA). Body composition, as well as glucose, lipid and energy metabolism, was studied. As expected, wild type mice fed the PUFA HFD gained less body weight and had lower body fat mass, hepatic lipid levels, plasma cholesterol and insulin levels and better glucose tolerance as compared to those fed the SAT HFD. Gpr120 deficient mice showed a similar improvement on the PUFA HFD as was observed for wild type mice. If anything, the Gpr120 deficient mice responded better to the PUFA HFD as compared to wild type mice with respect to liver fat content, plasma glucose levels and islet morphology. Gpr120 deficient animals were found to have similar energy, glucose and lipid metabolism when fed HFD PUFA compared to wild type mice. Therefore, GPR120 appears to be dispensable for the improved metabolic profile associated with intake of a diet enriched in n-3 PUFA fatty acids."

We assessed the feasibility and effect on quality of care of introducing diagnostics and pre-packaged paediatric-dosage drugs for malaria, pneumonia and diarrhoea at drug shops in Uganda. Methods We adopted and implemented the integrated community case management (iCCM) intervention within registered drug shops. Attendants were trained to perform malaria rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) in each fever case and count respiratory rate in each case of cough with fast/difficult breathing, before dispensing recommended treatment. Using a quasi-experimental design in one intervention and one non-intervention district, we conducted before and after exit interviews for drug seller practices and household surveys for treatment-seeking practices in May–June 2011 and May–June 2012. Survey adjusted generalized linear models and difference-in-difference analysis was used. Results 3759 (1604 before/2155 after) household interviews and 943 (163 before/780 after) exit interviews were conducted with caretakers of children under-5. At baseline, no child at a drug shop received any diagnostic testing before treatment in both districts. After the intervention, while no child in the non-intervention district received a diagnostic test, 87.7% (95% CI 79.0–96.4) of children with fever at the intervention district drug shops had a parasitological diagnosis of malaria, prior to treatment. The prevalence ratios of the effect of the intervention on treatment of cough and fast breathing with amoxicillin and diarrhoea with ORS/zinc at the drug shop were 2.8 (2.0–3.9), and 12.8 (4.2–38.6) respectively. From the household survey, the prevalence ratio of the intervention effect on use of RDTs was 3.2 (1.9–5.4); Artemisinin Combination Therapy for malaria was 0.74 (0.65–0.84), and ORS/zinc for diarrhoea was 2.3 (1.2–4.7). Conclusion iCCM can be utilized to improve access and appropriateness of care for children at drug shops."

The hope is that the increase in viral production will lead to killing of the infected cell either by the virus itself or by the patient's immune system, a “sterilizing cure.” Although administered within the context of combination antiretroviral therapy, the infection of bystander cells remains a concern. In this study, we investigated the effect of HDACi (belinostat, givinostat, panobinostat, romidepsin, and vorinostat) on the productive infection of macrophages. We demonstrate that the HDACi tested do not alter the initial susceptibility of macrophages to HIV infection. However, we demonstrate that HDACi decrease HIV release from macrophages in a dose-dependent manner (belinostat < givinostat < vorinostat < panobinostat < romidepsin) via degradation of intracellular HIV through the canonical autophagy pathway. This mechanism involves unc-51-like autophagy-activating kinase 1 (ULK1) and the inhibition of the mammalian target of rapamycin and requires the formation of autophagosomes and their maturation into autolysosomes in the absence of increased cell death. These data provide further evidence in support of a role for autophagy in the control of HIV infection and suggest that careful consideration of off-target effects will be essential if HDACi are to be a component of a multipronged approach to eliminate latently infected cells.

https://openalex.org/W2026779719,"For 3 decades, the view of MHCII-dependent antigen presentation has been completely dominated by peptide antigens despite our 2004 discovery in which MHCII was shown to present processed fragments of zwitterionic capsular polysaccharides to T cells. Published findings further demonstrate that polysaccharide A (PSA) from the capsule of Bacteroides fragilis is a potent activator of CD4+ T cells and that these T cells have important biological functions, especially in the maintenance of immunological homeostasis.

Peptide recognition is exquisitely specific and relies heavily upon clonal expansion of a very low-copy number of randomly generated TCR sequences within the naïve T cell repertoire. Pioneering work in T cell biology revealed that the precursor frequency for any given specificity can be as little as 20–200 copies in the entire body (3.Moon J.J. Chu H.H. Pepper M. McSorley S.J.

In contrast, superantigens, such as the Staphylococcus enterotoxin family, are intact proteins that derive their name from the ability to cause broad nonspecific T cell activation (4.Choi Y.W.

U.S.A. 1989; 86: 8941-8945Crossref PubMed Scopus (940) Google Scholar). Indeed, up to 50% of all T cells in the body could potentially respond to a superantigen (4.Choi Y.W. Kotzin B. Herron L. Callahan J. Marrack P. Kappler J. Interaction of Staphylococcus aureus toxin “superantigens” with human T cells.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1989; 86: 8941-8945Crossref PubMed Scopus (940) Google Scholar). The reason for this massive response is found in the mechanism of binding. Most superantigens associate with peptide-loaded MHCII molecules outside of the canonical peptide-binding groove. In addition, they associate with opposing TCR molecules via interactions with the germ line-encoded portions of specific variable β (Vβ) domains. As such, they cross-link the MHCII-TCR complex in a manner independent of the rearrangements localized in the complementarity-determining region (CDR) loops 1–3, in which antigen specificity is predominantly encoded. Despite the wealth of information on these classical pathways, the mechanism underlying T cell activation by polysaccharides remains poorly understood. We first discovered the ability of MHCII to present processed fragments of polysaccharides to T cells for recognition and activation in 2004 (5.Cobb B.A. Wang Q. Tzianabos A.O. Kasper D.L.

Despite these advances in our understanding of MHCII-mediated presentation of these unusual antigens, almost nothing is known about their recognition by their cognate T cell. Based on the levels of cytokine production and proliferation in T cell responses against PSA (16.Kreisman L.S.

Chem. 2011; 286: 8810-8818Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), it is reasonable to propose that T cell recognition of these “glycoantigens” is more like that of conventional peptide antigens than that of superantigens. However, the T cells that respond to PSA are highly anergic upon secondary exposure to the antigen (16.Kreisman L.S.

This anergy is likely associated with the function of these responding cells, which have been demonstrated to suppress a host of inflammatory conditions in vivo (7.Ruiz-Perez B. Chung D.R.

A regulatory phenotype is consistent with published data on PSA and the inability to isolate clones because no T cell clones of established regulatory T cells have ever been reported. For this reason, the antigens for natural thymically derived regulatory T cells remain a mystery. Here, we utilized next-generation sequencing to provide the first genetic-based characterization of the T cell response against the B. fragilis polysaccharide PSA. We found that immunization with PSA expanded a population of CD4+CD45RBlow T cells with an effector/memory surface phenotype (CD62LlowCD44high) and afforded mice robust protection from the induction of airway inflammation. Sequencing of all CDR3 loop sequences among the CD4+ T cell repertoire of immunized mice revealed clonal expansion of a limited number of clones in response to PSA and a conventional protein antigen (ovalbumin) compared with vehicle control naïve mice. Detailed informatic analysis revealed a lack of unusual CDR3 loop lengths among PSA-expanded clones and a lack of preferential Vβ and joining (J) segment use. In contrast, an unusual number of CDR3 loop sequences contained both positively and negatively charged residues, suggesting that recognition by the TCR may be driven in part by electrostatic interactions between MHCII-presented zwitterionic PSA and the opposing CDR3 loop. These data reveal that a polysaccharide antigen elicits a clonal and therefore specific T cell response that aligns with conventional peptide recognition and not superantigen cross-linking, thereby adding a new antigen class to the list of molecules capable of specific T cell recognition and induction of regulatory T cells. Wild-type (WT) C57BL/6 breeding pairs were obtained from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories and housed in specific pathogen-free (and B. fragilis-free) conditions according to guidelines established by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Case Western Reserve University (Cleveland, OH). Experimental mice were 7–12 weeks old. B. fragilis was grown in anaerobic conditions, and PSA was purified as described previously (5.Cobb B.A. Wang Q. Tzianabos A.O. Kasper D.L.

Negative controls utilized saline vehicle alone. Mice were sensitized to ovalbumin by intraperitoneal doses of 40 μg of ovalbumin in alum 7 days apart. Seven days following the second injection, the mice received intranasal ovalbumin (40 μg/dose in PBS; Sigma) for 6 consecutive days before being killed on day 7. For intranasal challenge, mice were anesthetized using a tabletop anesthesia system (VetEquip) with 3% isoflurane (Baxter). For T cell function, CD4+ splenocytes were purified with magnetic bead resin (Miltenyi Biotec) from the spleens of PSA- or mock saline-treated mice, and 2 × 106 T cells were transferred into ovalbumin-sensitized recipient mice 24 h prior to the beginning of intranasal ovalbumin challenges. Euthanasia was performed with a mixture of 8.6% ketamine (Fort Dodge Animal Health), 1.7% xylazine (AnaSed), and 2.9% acepromazine (Boehringer Ingelheim) in sterile saline. Mice were dosed at 0.006 ml/g. Mice were then tracheotomized, and lungs were flushed three times with 1 ml of PBS containing 0.6 mm EDTA. Cells from these washes were collected and resuspended in 50 μl of PBS with 0.6 mm EDTA, and differentials were performed by Cytospin and microscopic counting. Lungs were inflated with O.C.T. (Tissue-Tek) and fixed in 10% formalin prior to paraffin embedding and sectioning at the Case Western Reserve University Tissue Procurement and Histology Core Facility. CD4+ splenocytes were purified as described above and stained with CD4, CD25, CD45RB, CD62L, and CD44 (eBioscience). For in vitro stimulations, purified T cells were stimulated for 3 days with anti-CD3/CD28 resin (eBioscience). Cytokine levels were analyzed by standard sandwich ELISA (BioLegend). Flow cytometric analysis was performed on a BD Accuri C6 flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) using FCS Express software (De Novo Software). H&E staining of lung sections was performed by the Case Western Reserve University Tissue Procurement and Histology Core Facility. Unstained slides were stained with antibodies specific for EpCAM (epithelial cell adhesion molecule; 6 μg/ml, eBioscience) and myeloperoxidase (1:100 dilution, Abcam; anti-rabbit secondary, 1:1,000 dilution, Invitrogen). CD4+ T cells (106) were isolated from the spleens of treated (ovalbumin and PSA) or untreated (saline) mice and sent to Adaptive Biotechnologies for RNA extraction and deep sequencing of the TCR β-chain using their proprietary assay platform, as reported elsewhere (22.Marrero I. Hamm D.E. Davies J.D. High-throughput sequencing of islet-infiltrating memory CD4+ T cells reveals a similar pattern of TCR Vβ usage in prediabetic and diabetic NOD mice.PLoS ONE. 2013; 8: e76546Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Data analysis was performed using Adaptive Biotechologies immunoSEQ web tools and graphed using GraphPad Prism (version 5.0). All data are shown as means ± S.E. Mice included a minimum of four animals per group per replicate experiment. Graphs and statistical measures were generated with GraphPad Prism (version 5.0). For comparisons between multiple groups, analysis of variance was used, whereas for comparisons between two groups (where appropriate), Student's t test was used. WT C57BL/6 mice were orally immunized with 100 μg of PSA five times over 12 days to elicit a potent T cell response in vivo as reported previously (23.Tzianabos A.O. Kasper D.L. Cisneros R.L.

Invest. 1995; 96: 2727-2731Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). On day 15, CD4+ T cells were harvested from both the spleen and mesenteric lymph nodes and either re-stimulated with anti-CD3/CD28 beads or stained for flow cytometry to quantify the impact of PSA immunization. We found that the bulk CD4+ T cell population was skewed away from IFNγ production and toward IL-10 production compared with cells from saline-treated negative control mice (Fig. 1A). Flow cytometry further indicated that exposure to PSA expanded a population of CD45RBlow T cells, many of which also expressed the IL-2 receptor CD25, which is commonly found on regulatory T cells (Fig. 1B). No change in CD25 was seen in CD45RBhigh cells (Fig. 1, B and D). Finally, among the CD4+CD45RBlow T cells, the majority (66.5%) were CD62LlowCD44high effector/memory T cells (Fig. 1, C and D), demonstrating that the in vivo murine T cell response to PSA is dominated by IL-10 skewing through the expansion of CD4+CD45RBlowCD25+/− effector/memory T cells, which is consistent with our previous findings in humans (16.Kreisman L.S.

Chem. 2011; 286: 8810-8818Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). To characterize the genetic nature of PSA recognition by the αβTCR of T cells, CD4+ T cells were isolated from the spleens of WT mice immunized as described above (Fig. 1) with either PSA or ovalbumin as a conventional antigen control and with saline as a negative/naïve control. Total RNA was isolated, a library for deep sequencing was created for each mouse, and targeted sequencing of the β-chain of the αβTCR was performed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Table 1 provides the general statistics of the resulting sequencing data, including over 700,000 total and 65,000 unique (found at least once in that sample) productive (no stops) sequences per sample.TABLE 1αβTCR deep sequencing data statisticsNaïve 1Naïve 2Ovalbumin 1Ovalbumin 2Ovalbumin 3Ovalbumin 4PSA 1PSA 2PSA 3All sequences760,822706,728815,408668,174781,977780,581693,759731,230843,518Unique sequences66,45167,78569,43366,73264,84360,72863,74569,83867,605All productive sequences755,927702,065810,186633,761777,296774,838689,321726,419837,352Unique productive sequences65,90967,23468,85766,13164,31360,23463,20969,26466,989All sequences with stops4,8954,6635,2224,4134,6815,7434,4384,8116,166Unique sequences with stops542551576601530494536574616 Open table in a new tab Informatic analyses of the sequences revealed a lack of significant change in the number of αβTCRs carrying particular Vβ or J segments (Fig. 2), consistent with the notion that neither PSA nor ovalbumin activates T cells based solely upon germ line-encoded sequences. In addition, average CDR3 loop lengths across all sequences in PSA- and ovalbumin-immunized cohorts were indistinguishable from those in the naïve control cohort (Fig. 3), suggesting that although PSA is a much larger structure as presented by MHCII compared with ovalbumin (presented PSA = 5–10 kDa (5.Cobb B.A. Wang Q.

To better understand the clonality of the response against PSA, CDR3 loop sequences were compared between the three cohorts to identify those common to both naïve and PSA (or ovalbumin)-immunized mice, as well as those unique to each sample. In comparing the two naïve samples (naïve 1 versus naïve 2), we found 52,528 sequences unique to naïve 1, 54,718 sequences unique to naïve 2, and 13,527 sequences shared between both samples (Fig. 4A). When a naïve sample (naïve 1) was compared with an ovalbumin-immunized sample (ovalbumin 1), we found 55,830 sequences unique to naïve 1, 48,181 sequences unique to ovalbumin 1, and 12,415 sequences in common (Fig. 4B). Finally, when comparing naïve with PSA-immunized samples, we found 55,295 sequences unique to a naïve sample (naïve 1), 50,340 sequences unique to a PSA sample (PSA 1), and 12,950 sequences in common (Fig. 4C). Similar results were found with the other PSA and ovalbumin comparisons. To gain more insight into the most abundant clones, we evaluated the top 50 clones of the combined sequences of naïve, ovalbumin-immunized, and PSA-immunized cohorts. We found that for both ovalbumin- and PSA-immunized groups, a significant increase in a small number of clones was seen above the background of the naïve group (cutoff set at 0.2% of the total), strongly suggesting specific clonal expansion (Fig. 5). Translation of these expanded CDR3 loop sequences is consistent with the overall data, in which there was a lack of significant difference in total CDR3 loop length (Fig. 3). Interestingly, among the top 50 clones, there was a significantly higher proportion of zwitterionic TCRβ CDR3 amino acid sequences containing both acidic (negatively charged) and basic (positively charged) residues in the PSA-immunized cohorts compared with both naïve and ovalbumin-immunized samples (Fig. 6 and Table 2). Given the zwitterionic nature of the PSA antigen, these data suggest that electrostatic bonds influence PSA recognition.TABLE 2Zwitterionic TCRβ CDR3 LoopsTABLE 2Zwitterionic TCRβ CDR3 Loops To demonstrate biological activity of PSA-specific clonally expanded T cells, WT mice were immunized with PSA as described above (Fig. 1). Splenic CD4+ T cells from these or mock (saline)-treated mice were harvested and adoptively transferred into ovalbumin-sensitized recipients. These mice were then given daily intranasal ovalbumin challenges to induce airway inflammation. On day 7, lungs were lavaged to assess leukocyte infiltration and sectioned for histopathology by H&E staining and confocal microscopy. We found that adoptive transfer of CD4+ T cells from PSA-treated mice robustly inhibited leukocyte infiltration into the airway compared with T cells from saline-treated mice (Fig. 7, A–D). Likewise, PSA-expanded T cells prevented detectable tissue pathology (Fig. 7E), including the infiltration of activated myeloperoxidase-positive leukocytes in and around the airways (Fig. 7F). These data show the suppressive capacity of clonally expanded PSA-responding CD4+ T cells and collectively establish that a clonally expanded antimicrobial polysaccharide T cell response can play important roles in the maintenance of immune homeostasis. For over 2 decades, it has been known that zwitterionic polysaccharide glycoantigens like PSA from the commensal organism B. fragilis can activate CD4+ T cells (6.Tzianabos A.O. Onderdonk A.B.

Likewise, it has been known for a decade that this T cell activation is dependent upon processing of these molecules to small fragments (5–10 kDa) by nitric oxide-mediated oxidation and presentation by MHCII molecules (5.Cobb B.A. Wang Q.

Med. 2006; 203: 2853-2863Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar), the nature of T cell recognition remained in the background of the phenomenology of the response as a whole. For example, PSA-responding T cells have the capacity to prevent abscess and adhesion formation (19.Tzianabos A.O. Gibson 3rd, F.C. Cisneros R.L. Kasper D.L.

A microbial symbiosis factor prevents intestinal inflammatory disease.Nature. 2008; 453: 620-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (1696) Google Scholar). A complicating factor in understanding the nature of T cell recognition of PSA has been the failure to clone PSA-specific T cells. Our studies with human cells revealed that PSA-responding T cells become highly anergic upon re-stimulation with PSA and that this anergy is not fully broken by the addition of growth factors such as IL-2 (16.Kreisman L.S. Cobb B.A. Glycoantigens induce human peripheral Tr1 cell differentiation with gut-homing specialization.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 8810-8818Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Moreover, fusion of murine T cells from PSA-immunized mice also results in hybridomas that fail to proliferate, thus preventing cloning and the establishment of a PSA-specific clonal cell line (data not shown). In this study, we utilized deep RNA sequencing of the TCRβ locus in isolated CD4+ T cells from naïve, PSA-immunized, or control (ovalbumin)-immunized mice to provide the first glimpse of the αβTCRs expanded as a result of PSA exposure. TCRβ was used because expression of a single TCRβ allele prevents expression of the other TCRβ allele within the same cell, yet TCRα does not show this same allelic exclusion. The result is that any mature T cell will express exactly one TCRβ allele, but can conceivably express more than one TCRα allele, thereby making clonality based on TCRα sequencing ambiguous. We found that PSA induces a clonal expansion of a limited subset of T cells, which mirrors that seen with a conventional antigen. The response is characterized by average TCRβ CDR3 loop length and a lack of particular Vβ and J region use. A hallmark difference between nonspecific recognition of superantigens and the specific recognition of conventional peptide antigens is the use and distribution of Vβ segments in the responding T cell repertoire. Superantigens cross-link MHCII and Vβ domains in a manner independent of CDR loop rearrangements. As a result, these antigens activate essentially all T cells with an αβTCR containing specific Vβ domains. In contrast, conventional antigen recognition is driven by the CDR rearrangements and not specific Vβ or J domains. Given the lack of particular Vβ and J region use in response to PSA, our findings support the conclusion that recognition is driven by antigen-specific interactions, not by the nonspecific cross-linking seen with superantigens. The T cell response also shows a propensity to generate zwitterionic CDR3 loop sequences, at least within the TCR β-chain. This is intriguing because the impact of PSA charge neutralization on PSA-mediated T cell activation has been known for some time (6.Tzianabos A.O. Onderdonk A.B. Rosner B. Cisneros R.L. Kasper D.L.

Our work has shown that the loss of charges on PSA alters its conformation and significantly reduces interactions with MHCII (12.Kreisman L.S. Friedman J.H. Neaga A.

The correlation between the recognition of a zwitterionic antigen and a propensity for zwitterionic TCRβ CDR3 loop sequences raises the possibility that electrostatic interactions are a key feature in the recognition of these antigens by T cells, although further studies are needed to analyze the TCRα CDR3 loop sequences to determine what additional patterns may be critical for this response. Finally, we have demonstrated that the clonally expanded population of T cells in PSA-immunized mice can robustly prevent the onset of inflammation in the lung. This finding is consistent with the anti-inflammatory activity of PSA (18.Mazmanian S.K. Round J.L. Kasper D.L. A microbial symbiosis factor prevents intestinal inflammatory disease.Nature. 2008; 453: 620-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (1696) Google Scholar, 19.Tzianabos A.O. Gibson 3rd, F.C. Cisneros R.L.

Polysaccharide-mediated protection against abscess formation in experimental intra-abdominal sepsis.J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 2727-2731Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Because PSA is derived from a commensal organism, the ability to help maintain immune homeostasis via T cell expansion and skewing aligns our findings with the growing evidence for the protective efficacy of the microbiota in disease (27.Blaser M.J. The microbiome revolution.J. Clin. Invest. 2014; 124: 4162-4165Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Moreover, the apparent specificity of PSA recognition suggests that the anti-inflammatory activity of these T cells is characteristic of so-called bystander suppression, in which the regulatory T cell inhibits the activation of any other T cell regardless of its cognate antigen. This is supported by our findings with human cells, which suppress other T cell responses in vitro via IL-10 secretion (16.Kreisman L.S. Cobb B.A. Glycoantigens induce human peripheral Tr1 cell differentiation with gut-homing specialization.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 8810-8818Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). In summary, we have demonstrated that the zwitterionic polysaccharide PSA induces a specific clonal population of CD4+CD45RBlow effector/memory cells with in vivo regulatory activity characterized by IL-10-skewed cytokine production and protection of airway inflammation. PSA is therefore the first non-peptide MHCII-dependent antigen identified that is specifically recognized by CD4+ T cells, thereby expanding the paradigm of T cell biology to include polysaccharide antigens.

Kreisman for critical reading and assistance in the preparation of this manuscript."

However, despite its recognition as a stand-alone molecular target, development of suitable strategies to block its function is hindered because of its nonenzymatic nature. We reported earlier that arachidonate 5-lipoxygenase (5-Lox) plays an important role in the survival and growth of prostate cancer cells, although details of the underlying mechanisms have yet to be characterized. By whole genome gene expression array, we observed that inhibition of 5-Lox severely down-regulates the expression of c-Myc oncogene in prostate cancer cells. Moreover, inhibition of 5-Lox dramatically decreases the protein level, nuclear accumulation, DNA binding, and transcriptional activities of c-Myc. Both the 5-Lox inhibition-induced down-regulation of c-Myc and induction of apoptosis are mitigated when the cells are treated with 5-oxoeicosatetraenoic acid, a metabolite of 5-Lox, confirming a role of 5-Lox in these processes. c-Myc is a transforming oncogene widely expressed in prostate cancer cells and maintains their transformed phenotype. Interestingly, MK591, a specific 5-Lox inhibitor, strongly affects the viability of Myc-overactivated prostate cancer cells and completely blocks their invasive and soft agar colony-forming abilities, but it spares nontransformed cells where expression of 5-Lox is undetectable. These findings indicate that the oncogenic function of c-Myc in prostate cancer cells is regulated by 5-Lox activity, revealing a novel mechanism of 5-Lox action and suggesting that the oncogenic function of c-Myc can be suppressed by suitable inhibitors of 5-Lox.

One strategy to achieve this aim is to exploit the wealth of so called landraces of crop species, representing diverse traditional domesticated populations of locally adapted genotypes. In this study, we investigated a comprehensive set of 1485 spring barley landraces (Lrc1485) adapted to a wide range of climates, which were selected from one of the largest genebanks worldwide. The landraces originated from 5° to 62.5° N and 16° to 71° E. The whole collection was genotyped using 42 SSR markers to assess the genetic diversity and population structure. With an average allelic richness of 5.74 and 372 alleles, Lrc1485 harbours considerably more genetic diversity than the most polymorphic current GWAS panel for barley. Ten major clusters defined most of the population structure based on geographical origin, row type of the ear and caryopsis type - and were assigned to specific climate zones. The legacy core reference set Lrc648 established in this study will provide a long-lasting resource and a very valuable tool for the scientific community. Lrc648 is best suited for multi-environmental field testing to identify candidate genes underlying quantitative traits but also for allele mining approaches."

However, little is known about the molecular mechanism of how TSWV N interacts with genomic RNA. In this study, we demonstrated that TSWV N protein forms a range of higher ordered oligomers. Analysis of the RNA binding behavior of N protein revealed that no specific oligomer binds to RNA preferentially, instead each type of N oligomer is able to bind RNA. To better characterize the structure and function of N protein interacting with RNA, we constructed homology models of TSWV N and N-RNA complexes. Based on these homology models, we demonstrated that the positively charged and polar amino acids in its predicted surface cleft of TSWV N are critical for RNA binding. Moreover, by N-RNA homology modeling, we found that the RNA component is deeply embedded in the predicted protein cleft; consistently, TSWV N-RNA complexes are relatively resistant to digestion by RNase. Collectively, using homology modeling, we determined the RNA binding sites on N and found a new protective feature for N protein. Our findings also provide novel insights into the molecular details of the interaction of TSWV N with RNA components."
https://openalex.org/W1964168256,"Six months-old seminal plants of 36 cacao genotypes grown under greenhouse conditions were subjected to two soil water regimes (control and drought) to assess, the effects of water deficit on growth, chemical composition and oxidative stress. In the control, soil moisture was maintained near field capacity with leaf water potentials (ΨWL) ranging from −0.1 to −0.5 MPa. In the drought treatment, the soil moisture was reduced gradually by withholding additional water until ΨWL reached values of between −2.0 to −2.5 MPa. The tolerant genotypes PS-1319, MO-20 and MA-15 recorded significant increases in guaiacol peroxidase activity reflecting a more efficient antioxidant metabolism. In relation to drought tolerance, the most important variables in the distinguishing contrasting groups were: total leaf area per plant; leaf, stem and total dry biomass; relative growth rate; plant shoot biomass and leaf content of N, Ca, and Mg. From the results of these analyses, six genotypes were selected with contrasting characteristics for tolerance to soil water deficit [CC-40, C. SUL-4 and SIC-2 (non-tolerant) and MA-15, MO-20, and PA-13 (tolerant)] for further assessment of the expression of genes NCED5, PP2C, psbA and psbO to water deficit. Increased expression of NCED5, PP2C, psbA and psbO genes were found for non-tolerant genotypes, while in the majority of tolerant genotypes there was repression of these genes, with the exception of PA-13 that showed an increased expression of psbA. Mutivariate analysis showed that growth variables, leaf and total dry biomass, relative growth rate as well as Mg content of the leaves were the most important factor in the classification of the genotypes as tolerant, moderately tolerant and sensitive to water deficit. Therefore these variables are reliable plant traits in the selection of plants tolerant to drought."

In this study, we show that another calcium-binding protein, annexin A11 (AnxA11), physically associates with Sec31A by the adaptor function of ALG-2. Depletion of AnxA11 or ALG-2 decreases the population of Sec31A that is stably associated with the ERES and causes scattering of juxtanuclear ERES to the cell periphery. The synchronous ER-to-Golgi transport of transmembrane cargoes is accelerated in AnxA11- or ALG-2-knockdown cells.

https://openalex.org/W1988093201,"Background Psoriasis is a prevalent autoimmune disorder. Various studies have reported on the relationship between psoriasis and chronic diseases but very few have explored the association between psoriasis and subsequent acute infection. This retrospective cohort study aimed to compare the risk of pneumonia between subjects with and those without psoriasis. Methods The medical records of 14,022 patients with psoriasis and 14,022 without psoriasis were obtained from the Taiwan Longitudinal Health Insurance Database 2000. Each patient was followed-up for a three-year period. Cox proportional hazard regressions were performed to compare difference of subsequent pneumonia incidence between subjects with and those without psoriasis. Results There were 206 (1.47%) subjects with psoriasis and 138 (0.98%) without psoriasis hospitalized for pneumonia. By Cox proportional hazard regressions analysis, the HR (hazard ratio) of pneumonia requiring hospitalization for patients with psoriasis was 1.50 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.21–1.86) compared to patients without psoriasis. The adjusted HR was 1.40 (95% CI: 1.12–1.73). The adjusted HR of pneumonia hospitalization for subjects with mild and severe psoriasis was 1.36 (95% CI: 1.09–1.70) and 1.68 (95% CI: 1.12–2.52), respectively, compared to those without psoriasis. Conclusions Patients with psoriasis have significantly higher incidence of pneumonia compared to those without psoriasis."
https://openalex.org/W1999597037,"Acute mesenteric ischemia (AMI) is a life-threatening condition that can result in multiple organ injury and death. A timely diagnosis and treatment would have a significant impact on the morbidity and mortality in high-risk patient population. The purpose of this study was to investigate if intestinal fatty acid binding protein (I-FABP) and α-defensins can be used as biomarkers for early AMI and resultant lung injury. C57BL/6 mice were subjected to intestinal ischemia by occlusion of the superior mesenteric artery. A time course of intestinal ischemia from 0.5 to 3 h was performed and followed by reperfusion for 2 h. Additional mice were treated with N-acetyl-cysteine (NAC) at 300 mg/kg given intraperitoneally prior to reperfusion. AMI resulted in severe intestinal injury characterized by neutrophil infiltrate, myeloperoxidase (MPO) levels, cytokine/chemokine levels, and tissue histopathology. Pathologic signs of ischemia were evident at 1 h, and by 3 h of ischemia, the full thickness of the intestine mucosa had areas of coagulative necrosis. It was noted that the levels of α-defensins in intestinal tissue peaked at 1 h and I-FABP in plasma peaked at 3 h after AMI. Intestinal ischemia also resulted in lung injury in a time-dependent manner. Pretreatment with NAC decreased the levels of intestinal α-defensins and plasma I-FABP, as well as lung MPO and cytokines. In summary, the concentrations of intestinal α-defensins and plasma I-FABP predicted intestinal ischemia prior to pathological evidence of ischemia and I-FABP directly correlated with resultant lung injury. The antioxidant NAC reduced intestinal and lung injury induced by AMI, suggesting a role for oxidants in the mechanism for distant organ injury. I-FABP and α-defensins are promising biomarkers, and may guide the treatment with antioxidant in early intestinal and distal organ injury."

Abl family kinases also have kinase-independent functions. This was first noted by Hoffmann and co-workers (14.Henkemeyer M. West S.R. Gertler F.B. Hoffmann F.M. A novel tyrosine kinase-independent function of Drosophila abl correlates with proper subcellular localization.Cell. 1990; 63: 949-960Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), who found that many of the defects in cell morphogenesis in abl mutant Drosophila embryos could be rescued by a kinase-inactive Abl transgene.

These data suggest that Abl family kinases also regulate actin-dependent processes in a kinase-independent manner, but the mechanisms by which they do so are unclear. Abl family kinases are unique in that they contain C-terminal extensions with protein-protein interaction motifs and cytoskeletal binding domains. The Arg C-terminal extension uniquely contains multiple cytoskeletal binding domains, including an internal actin-binding (I/L)WEQ domain, a microtubule-binding domain, and a C-terminal actin-binding calponin homology (CH) domain (Fig. 1A) (16.Miller A.L.

Arg binds cooperatively to actin filaments at a saturation binding density of one Arg to two actin subunits and induces a 30° twist in the actin filament (18.Galkin V.E. Orlova A. Koleske A.J.

Cortactin also binds actin filaments directly through its “cortactin repeat” region (Fig. 1A) (10.Weed S.A. Karginov A.V. Schafer D.A. Weaver A.M. Kinley A.W. Cooper J.A. Parsons J.T.

Remarkably, cortactin binds Arg-coated actin filaments at twice the density (one cortactin to two actins) of naked actin filaments (one cortactin to four actins) (19.MacGrath S.M. Koleske A.J. Arg/Abl2 modulates the affinity and stoichiometry of binding of cortactin to F-actin.Biochemistry. 2012; 51: 6644-6653Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The capacity of Arg to recruit cortactin to polymerizing actin may be an important regulatory mechanism within cells. Consistent with this model, knocking down Arg in cultured neurons significantly reduces cortactin in dendritic spines, resulting in their destabilization (7.Lin Y.C. Yeckel M.F. Koleske A.J. Abl2/Arg controls dendritic spine and dendrite arbor stability via distinct cytoskeletal control pathways.J. Neurosci. 2013; 33: 1846-1857Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Previous work demonstrated that Arg is a key regulator of subcellular structures composed of actin filaments, but it was not known whether Arg alone or in combination with cortactin controls actin filament polymerization, depolymerization, branching by the Arp2/3 complex, or severing by cofilin. We used total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy to investigate each of these reactions. We found that neither Arg nor cortactin alters actin elongation, but both slow dissociation of subunits from the barbed end of the filament. Low concentrations of Arg and cortactin cooperate to stabilize actin filaments. Arg potentiates actin filament branching by the Arp2/3 complex with cortactin and the verprolin-connecting acidic domain (VCA) of N-WASp. Arg also stimulates filament severing by cofilin in a concentration-dependent manner, but cortactin attenuates this stimulation. Together, our results illustrate that Arg directly regulates actin filament dynamics in several ways and that cortactin modulates these activities. Murine Arg and cortactin cDNAs were cloned with an engineered His6 tag into the pFastbac1 vector (Invitrogen). Arg deletion constructs and fragments as well as cortactin 3YF and W525A mutants were generated using PCR-based mutagenesis (15.Lapetina S. Mader C.C. Machida K. Mayer B.J. Koleske A.J.

Cells were lysed in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 500 mm NaCl, 0.01% Triton X-100, 5% glycerol, 20 mm imidazole, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm EDTA, and protease inhibitors (benzamidine, aprotinin, leupeptin, and chymostatin)). His6-tagged proteins were purified on a Ni2+ affinity column and eluted with 250 mm imidazole, followed by an SP-Sepharose ion exchange column with a 100 mm NaCl wash. Final elution buffer was 50 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 500 mm NaCl, 5% glycerol, 0.01% Triton X-100, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm EDTA. De-P W525A was dephosphorylated as described previously (22.Liu W. MacGrath S.M.

Actin was purified from an acetone powder of frozen chicken breast muscle (Trader Joe's) by one cycle of polymerization and depolymerization (23.MacLean-Fletcher S. Pollard T.D. Identification of a factor in conventional muscle actin preparations which inhibits actin filament self-association.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1980; 96: 18-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar), followed by gel filtration in Buffer G (2 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 0.5 mm ATP, 0.5 mm DTT, 0.1 mm CaCl2, and 1 mm NaN3) and storage in Buffer G at 4 °C. Actin monomers were polymerized by dialyzing in 50 mm PIPES/Tris (pH 6.8), 50 mm KCl, 0.2 mm ATP, 0.2 mm CaCl2 and labeled on lysines by incubating overnight at 4 °C with a 1:13 molar ratio of actin to Alexa Fluor 488 succinimidyl ester (A-20000, Invitrogen). Labeled actin was then pelleted by ultracentrifugation at 120,000 × g, depolymerized, clarified, and gel-filtered on Sephacryl S-300 resin in Buffer G. Purified Alexa 488 monomers were typically labeled 30–50%. Prior to each experiment, Ca2+-ATP actin monomers (20% Alexa 488-labeled) were converted to Mg2+-ATP actin by addition of 0.05 mm MgCl2 and 0.2 mm EGTA followed by a 5-min incubation. Bovine Arp2/3 complex and GST-VCA were purified from thymus as described previously by Higgs et al. (24.Higgs H.N. Blanchoin L. Pollard T.D. Influence of the C terminus of Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (WASp) and the Arp2/3 complex on actin polymerization.Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 15212-15222Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Human cofilin 1 was expressed in pLysS cells with 1 mm isopropyl β-d-1-thioglactopyranoside over a 4-h incubation period at 37 °C. Cell pellets were resuspended in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mm EGTA, and 2 mm DTT and lysed by sonication. Cell lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 21,200 × g for 45 min. The lysate supernatant was applied to a DEAE-Sepharose column, and the flow-through was dialyzed in 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 2 mm DTT. The protein was then concentrated to 25 ml using a centrifuge filter device (Corning Glass, 10-kDa molecular mass cutoff), gel-filtered on a 400-ml column of Sephacryl S-200 resin, and dialyzed in KMEI buffer (50 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 10 mm imidazole (pH 7.0)), flash-frozen, and stored at −80 °C. Open-ended glass flow chambers were prepared (25.Kuhn J.R. Pollard T.D. Real-time measurements of actin filament polymerization by total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy.Biophys.

Prior to each reaction, the chamber was incubated for 1 min with two 8-μl washes of each of the following solutions: 1) 0.5% Tween 80 in high salt TBS (HS-TBS: 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 600 mm KCl); 2) 250 nm N-ethylmaleimide-inactivated chicken skeletal muscle myosin in HS-TBS; and 3) 10% BSA in HS-TBS. The chamber was washed twice with HS-TBS between each incubation step and with KMEI buffer immediately before introducing actin. Equal parts of 2× microscopy buffer (70 mm KCl, 1.4 mm MgCl2, 1.4 mm EGTA, 14 mm imidazole (pH 7.0), 1% (4000 cP) methyl cellulose, 30 mm glucose, 400 μm ATP, 100 mm DTT, 40 μg/ml catalase, 200 μg/ml glucose oxidase) and elution buffer (see above) were mixed and added to the actin monomers in Buffer G to induce polymerization. The resulting buffer contained 250 mm NaCl and 35 mm KCl. To compensate for the effect of salt on the affinity of cofilin for actin filaments (28.De La Cruz E.M. How cofilin severs an actin filament.Biophys. Rev. 2009; 1: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), we used 30 μm cofilin in the severing experiments. For depolymerization, branching, and severing experiments, actin was polymerized in the chamber until filaments were visible. Then the actin monomer solution was replaced with a fresh sample of proteins (i.e. Arg and/or cortactin, plus 10 nm bovine Arp2/3 complex, 100 nm GST-VCA, and 1 μm ATP-actin monomers for branching experiments, or 30 μm human cofilin 1 for severing experiments) in microscopy buffer, and imaging was continued. Fluorescence micrographs were collected every 5–10 s using prism-style total internal reflection microscopy on an Olympus IX-70 inverted microscope and a Hamamatsu C4747-95 CCD (Orca-ER) camera controlled by MetaMorph software (Molecular Devices, Union City, CA). Changes in filament length were measured using ImageJ software (National Institutes of Health) for at least 10 filaments in each condition over 10–20 frames, which covered a span of at least 200 s. We assumed 370 actin subunits per μm of filament (29.Huxley H.E. Brown W. Low-angle x-ray diagram of vertebrate striated muscle and its behaviour during contraction and rigor.J. Mol. Biol. 1967; 30: 383-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (732) Google Scholar). Kinase reactions were performed using 50 nm Arg and 1 μm substrate (cofilin and GST-CrkII as a control) in 25 mm Hepes (pH 7.25), 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 5% glycerol, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm MnCl2, 5 μm ATP, 0.75 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. Reactions were terminated at 5, 30, and 60 min, separated on SDS-polyacrylamide gels, and exposed to phosphorimaging screens. Two micromolar actin filaments were incubated with either 50 μm cofilin or 1 μm cortactin or both and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h. Pellet samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and stained with Coomassie Blue. The intensities of the cofilin and actin bands were quantified with ImageJ, and the relative filament saturation by cofilin was obtained by dividing the intensity of the cofilin band by the intensity of the actin band in each lane. We used total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy to extend our studies of the effects of Arg and cortactin on actin polymerization (19.MacGrath S.M. Koleske A.J. Arg/Abl2 modulates the affinity and stoichiometry of binding of cortactin to F-actin.Biochemistry. 2012; 51: 6644-6653Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) by measuring rates of barbed end elongation and shortening. Arg binds actin filaments cooperatively with a KD, (app) ≈0.3 μm (17.Wang Y. Miller A.L. Mooseker M.S. Koleske A.J. The Abl-related gene (Arg) nonreceptor tyrosine kinase uses two F-actin-binding domains to bundle F-actin.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2001; 98: 14865-14870Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), whereas cortactin binds with a KD = 0.4 μm (31.van Rossum A.G. de Graaf J.H. Schuuring-Scholtes E. Kluin P.M. Fan Y.X. Zhan X.

Neither protein significantly affected elongation of Mg-ATP-actin (20% labeled with Alexa 488) at concentrations up to 1.5 μm (Fig. 1C). We confirmed our previous observation that 1 μm Arg slows depolymerization of actin filaments ∼6-fold (Fig. 1E). At 1 μm, Arg saturates ∼91% of the binding sites on the actin filaments. Experiments with deletion mutants (Fig. 1, A and B) showed that inhibition of depolymerization by 1 μm Arg depends much more on the internal Arg (I/L)WEQ actin-binding site than the C-terminal CH domain (Table 1). Thus the ability of the CH domain to change the twist in the actin filament (18.Galkin V.E. Orlova A. Koleske A.J. Egelman E.H. The Arg non-receptor tyrosine kinase modifies F-actin structure.J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 346: 565-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) is not required to slow depolymerization. The Arg paralog Abl and cortactin also slowed depolymerization (Table 1).TABLE 1Barbed end depolymerization rates mediated by Arg and AblArg concentrationsArgArgΔ(I/L)WEQArgΔCHAblμm0 (control)−3.3 ± 0.16aPolymerization rates are in subunits/s.

Open table in a new tab Neither Arg nor cortactin inhibited depolymerization effectively at concentrations below their KD values, so high densities of either protein on filaments are required to slow depolymerization (Fig. 1E and TABLE 1, TABLE 2). The binding densities are only about 50% saturation with 0.3 μm Arg and 27% saturation with 0.15 μm cortactin, where neither alone inhibited depolymerization (Fig. 1E and Table 1).TABLE 2Barbed end depolymerization rates mediated by cortactinCortactin concentrationsCortactinCortactin 3YFCortactin W525ACortactin de-P W525Aμm0 (control)−3.3 ± 0.16aPolymerization rates are in subunits/s.

Errors are standard error from the analysis of 10–20 filaments. Open table in a new tab Although neither Arg nor cortactin inhibited depolymerization at low concentrations, a combination of 0.3 μm Arg plus 0.15 μm cortactin slowed depolymerization to the same extent as 1 μm of either protein (Fig. 1, D and E, and Table 1). However, combining 0.15 μm cortactin with 0.3 μm Abl did not slow depolymerization (Fig. 1D and Table 1). Experiments with Arg deletion mutants demonstrated that recruitment of cortactin by the Arg CH domain is not necessary, but it can be sufficient for synergism between Arg and cortactin under some conditions. First, even though ArgΔCH does not recruit cortactin to actin filaments (19.MacGrath S.M. Koleske A.J. Arg/Abl2 modulates the affinity and stoichiometry of binding of cortactin to F-actin.Biochemistry. 2012; 51: 6644-6653Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), 0.3 μm ArgΔCH allowed 0.15 μm cortactin to slow barbed end depolymerization (Table 1). Second, 1 μm ArgΔ(I/L)WEQ promotes cortactin binding to filaments (19.MacGrath S.M. Koleske A.J. Arg/Abl2 modulates the affinity and stoichiometry of binding of cortactin to F-actin.Biochemistry. 2012; 51: 6644-6653Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), but it did not slow polymerization by itself. Yet 0.3 μm ArgΔ(I/L)WEQ synergized with 0.15 μm cortactin to slow depolymerization (Table 1). These observations suggest that loading filaments with cortactin by the Arg CH domain can compensate for the loss of the (I/L)WEQ domain in protecting filaments from depolymerization. We used several mutants of cortactin (Fig. 1A) to test whether direct interaction with Arg is required to stabilize actin filaments. First, a point mutation in the cortactin Src homology 3 domain (W525A) disrupted binding to the Arg PYLPRLP motif, which is required for Arg to phosphorylate several tyrosines in cortactin (15.Lapetina S. Mader C.C. Machida K. Mayer B.J. Koleske A.J. Arg interacts with cortactin to promote adhesion-dependent cell edge protrusion.J.

Arg/Abl2 modulates the affinity and stoichiometry of binding of cortactin to F-actin.Biochemistry. 2012; 51: 6644-6653Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Second, replacement of the phosphorylatable tyrosine residues Tyr-421, Tyr-466, and Tyr-482 with phenylalanine in the 3YF mutant prevented phosphorylation and subsequent Arg Src homology 2 domain binding (33.Gifford S.M.

Third, we treated W525A with calf intestinal phosphatase, which we have previously shown to remove all tyrosine phosphorylation, to produce dephosphorylated (de-P)-W525A (19.MacGrath S.M. Koleske A.J. Arg/Abl2 modulates the affinity and stoichiometry of binding of cortactin to F-actin.Biochemistry. 2012; 51: 6644-6653Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar).

LTC4 is a proinflammatory factor that acts on plasma membrane cysteinyl leukotriene receptors. Recently, however, we showed that LTC4 was also a cytosolic second messenger that activated store-independent LTC4-regulated Ca2+ (LRC) channels encoded by Orai1/Orai3 heteromultimers in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs). We showed that Orai3 and LRC currents were up-regulated in medial and neointimal VSMCs after vascular injury and that Orai3 knockdown inhibited LRC currents and neointimal hyperplasia. However, the role of LTC4S in neointima formation remains unknown. Here we show that LTC4S knockdown inhibited LRC currents in VSMCs. We performed in vivo experiments where rat left carotid arteries were injured using balloon angioplasty to cause neointimal hyperplasia. Neointima formation was associated with up-regulation of LTC4S protein expression in VSMCs. Inhibition of LTC4S expression in injured carotids by lentiviral particles encoding shRNA inhibited neointima formation and inward and outward vessel remodeling. LRC current activation did not cause nuclear factor for activated T cells (NFAT) nuclear translocation in VSMCs. Surprisingly, knockdown of either LTC4S or Orai3 yielded more robust and sustained Akt1 and Akt2 phosphorylation on Ser-473/Ser-474 upon serum stimulation. LTC4S and Orai3 knockdown inhibited VSMC migration in vitro with no effect on proliferation. Akt activity was suppressed in neointimal and medial VSMCs from injured vessels at 2 weeks postinjury but was restored when the up-regulation of either LTC4S or Orai3 was prevented by shRNA.

https://openalex.org/W2050720706,"This study analyzed 42 Acinetobacter baumannii strains collected between 2009–2012 from different hospitals in Beyrouth and North Lebanon to better understand the epidemiology and carbapenem resistance mechanisms in our collection and to compare the robustness of pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), multilocus sequence typing (MLST), repetitive sequence-based PCR (rep-PCR) and blaOXA-51 sequence-based typing (SBT). Among 31 carbapenem resistant strains, we have detected three carbapenem resistance genes: 28 carried the blaOXA-23 gene, 1 the blaOXA-24 gene and 2 strains the blaOXA-58 gene. This is the first detection of blaOXA-23 and blaOXA-24 in Lebanon. PFGE identified 11 types and was the most discriminating technique followed by rep-PCR (9 types), blaOXA-51 SBT (8 types) and MLST (7 types). The PFGE type A'/ST2 was the dominant genotype in our collection present in Beyrouth and North Lebanon. The clustering agreement between all techniques was measured by adjust Wallace coefficient. An overall agreement has been demonstrated. High values of adjust Wallace coefficient were found with followed combinations: PFGE to predict MLST types = 100%, PFGE to predict blaOXA-51 SBT = 100%, blaOXA-51 SBT to predict MLST = 100%, MLST to predict blaOXA-51 SBT = 84.7%, rep-PCR to predict MLST = 81.5%, PFGE to predict rep-PCR = 69% and rep-PCR to predict blaOXA-51 SBT = 67.2%. PFGE and MLST are gold standard methods for outbreaks investigation and population structure studies respectively. Otherwise, these two techniques are technically, time and cost demanding. We recommend the use of blaOXA-51 SBT as first typing method to screen isolates and assign them to their corresponding clonal lineages. Repetitive sequence-based PCR is a rapid tool to access outbreaks but careful interpretation of results must be always performed."
https://openalex.org/W2021522493,"Adaptation to dynamic environmental cues during organismal development requires coordination of tissue growth with available resources. More specifically, the effects of oxygen availability on body size have been well-documented, but the mechanisms through which hypoxia restricts systemic growth have not been fully elucidated. Here, we characterize the larval growth and metabolic defects in Drosophila that result from hypoxia. Hypoxic conditions reduced fat body opacity and increased lipid droplet accumulation in this tissue, without eliciting lipid aggregation in hepatocyte-like cells called oenocytes. Additionally, hypoxia increased the retention of Dilp2 in the insulin-producing cells of the larval brain, associated with a reduction of insulin signaling in peripheral tissues. Overexpression of the wildtype form of the insulin receptor ubiquitously and in the larval trachea rendered larvae resistant to hypoxia-induced growth restriction. Furthermore, Warts downregulation in the trachea was similar to increased insulin receptor signaling during oxygen deprivation, which both rescued hypoxia-induced growth restriction, inhibition of tracheal molting, and developmental delay. Insulin signaling and loss of Warts function increased tracheal growth and augmented tracheal plasticity under hypoxic conditions, enhancing oxygen delivery during periods of oxygen deprivation. Our findings demonstrate a mechanism that coordinates oxygen availability with systemic growth in which hypoxia-induced reduction of insulin receptor signaling decreases plasticity of the larval trachea that is required for the maintenance of systemic growth during times of limiting oxygen availability."

The activated type I receptor phosphorylates the receptor-regulated Smads (R-Smad; Smad2 and Smad3 for TGF-β and Smad1, Smad5, and Smad8 for BMPs) inducing their association with the common partner, Smad4. The R-Smad·Smad4 complex then translocates to the nucleus to activate specific genes (4.Shi Y. Massagué J.

These studies suggest that although loss of menin contributes to the neoplasias that eventually arise, it does not affect normal development in these particular tissues. Mice that are constitutively homozygous null for the Men1 gene die in utero at mid-gestation of multiple defects in developing organs, suggesting that menin does play critical essential roles in tissues additional to those affected in the MEN1 syndrome (10.Crabtree J.S.

We previously showed that menin is required for the commitment of multipotential mesenchymal stem cells in vitro to the osteoblast lineage (19.Sowa H. Kaji H. Canaff L. Hendy G.N. Tsukamoto T.

This occurs in part by menin facilitating BMP-2 signaling via Smads and the transcriptional activity of the key osteoblast transcription factor, Runx2 (20.Sowa H. Kaji H. Hendy G.N. Canaff L. Komori T. Sugimoto T. Chihara K. Menin is required for bone morphogenetic protein 2- and transforming growth factor β-regulated osteoblastic differentiation through interaction with Smads and Runx2.J. Biol.

Menin interacts physically and functionally with Smads1/5 and Runx2 in mesenchymal stem cells (20.Sowa H. Kaji H. Hendy G.N. Canaff L. Komori T. Sugimoto T. Chihara K. Menin is required for bone morphogenetic protein 2- and transforming growth factor β-regulated osteoblastic differentiation through interaction with Smads and Runx2.J. Biol.

In committed osteoblasts these interactions are for the most part lost, as menin then acts to maintain the osteoblast in its differentiated state. This is mediated in part by menin's interaction with the TGF-β/Smad3 pathway (20.Sowa H. Kaji H. Hendy G.N. Canaff L. Komori T. Sugimoto T. Chihara K. Menin is required for bone morphogenetic protein 2- and transforming growth factor β-regulated osteoblastic differentiation through interaction with Smads and Runx2.J. Biol.

Based on our previous in vitro studies, we hypothesized that menin plays a critical role not only in osteoblastogenesis and osteoblast differentiation but also in bone mass accumulation in vivo (22.Hendy G.N. Kaji H. Canaff L. Role of menin in bone development.Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 2009; 668: 37-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). To further understand the role of menin in bone development in vivo we generated and examined mouse models in which the expression of the Men1 gene is specifically altered only in mature osteoblasts. Conditional knock-out and transgenic mouse models in which either the Men1 gene is deleted or the menin cDNA is overexpressed specifically in differentiated osteoblasts were generated. Mice were maintained in a pathogen-free standard animal facility, and experimental procedures were performed following an animal use protocol approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of McGill University. Men1flox/flox mice were obtained from The Jackson Laboratory (129S(FVB)-Men1tm1.2Ctre/J) (10.Crabtree J.S. Scacheri P.C. Ward J.M. Garrett-Beal L. Emmert-Buck M.R. Edgemon K.A. Lorang D. Libutti S.K.

Chem. 2002; 277: 44005-44012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar). Men1flox/flox mice were crossed with OC-CreTG/+ mice to generate OC-CreTG/+;Men1flox/+ mice. These mice were crossed with Men1flox/flox mice to generate litters that contained ∼¼ OC-CreTG/+;Men1flox/flox mice, which were used for subsequent crosses. The control littermate mice are designated as Men1f/f and the knock-out mice as OC-Cre;Men1f/f. Both were on the FVB background. A full-length FLAG-tagged human menin cDNA preceded by a rabbit β-globin intron was inserted in between a 2.3-kb mouse Col1a1 promoter fragment (24.Rossert J. Eberspaecher H. de Crombrugghe B. Separate cis-acting DNA elements of the mouse pro-α1(I) collagen promoter direct expression of reporter genes to different type I collagen-producing cells in transgenic mice.J.

The transgene sequence was released from the plasmid backbone by SacII restriction enzyme digestion. Transgenic founders were generated by pronuclear injections at McGill Cancer Center Transgenic Core Facility. For osteoblast-specific menin transgenic mice analysis, their wild-type littermate mice were used as controls. The mutant mouse strain of Col1a1-Menin-Tg mice was on the C57BL6/J background. Genotyping strategies are available upon request. To test for the specific deletion of Men1 exons 3–8, genomic DNA isolated from different tissues was amplified using a combination of primers A, C, and D. Primer A (5′-CCCACATCCAGTCCCTCTTCAGCT-3′) is specific to exon 2 of the Men1 gene. Primer C (5′-CGGAGAAAGAGGTAATGAAATGGC-3′) is specific for the inserted LoxP sequence. Primer D (5′-CATAAAATCGCAGCAGGTGGGCAA-3′) is specific for Men1 exon 9. PCR of the recombinant Δ3–8 Men1 allele generates a 638-bp amplicon (primers A + D), and the Men1flox allele generates a 239-bp amplicon (primers A + C). The OC-Cre transgene was detected using the primers 5′-CAAATAGCCCTGGCAGATTC-3′ and 5′-TGATACAAGGGACATCTTCC-3′ to generate a 260-bp product corresponding to a portion of the OC promoter and the rabbit β-globin intron. Reverse transcription (RT)-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed to detect the expression of the Col1a1-Menin transgene in tissues. See “Gene Expression Analysis” below for RNA extraction and cDNA synthesis. A forward primer specific for human menin (5′-GTGAGAAGATGAAGGGCATGA-3′) and a reverse primer specific for the SV40 polyadenylation signal (5′-TAATGTGGCTATGGGAATTGGA-3′) amplified a 640-bp transgene product. As an internal standard, a 350-bp product of the hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT) cDNA was amplified using specific primers; F (5′-GTTGAGAGATCATCTCCACC-3′) and R (5′-AGCGATGATGAACCAGGTTA-3′). The PCR conditions were 95 °C for 30 s, 60 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 1 min for 30 cycles. Tissues and isolated primary osteoblasts were homogenized on ice in triple detergent buffer, and Western blotting was performed as previously described (25.Canaff L. Vanbellinghen J.F. Kanazawa I.

Membranes were reprobed with a β-tubulin antibody (Santa Cruz) as the loading control. Anesthetized mice were placed prone on a specimen tray in a PIXImus densitometer (Lunar Corp., Madison, WI), densitometry was performed on the right femur, and BMD was calculated with the manufacturer's software (version 1.46.007). Mice femurs, dissected free of soft tissue, were fixed overnight in 70% ethanol. High resolution images of the distal femur were acquired with a desktop microtomographic imaging system (SkyScan 1072, Antwerp, Belgium) in accordance with the recommendations of the American Society of Bone and Mineral Research (26.Bouxsein M.L. Boyd S.K. Christiansen B.A. Guldberg R.E. Jepsen K.J. Müller R. Guidelines of assessment of bone microstructure in rodents using micro-computed tomography.J. Bone Miner. Res. 2010; 25: 1468-1486Crossref PubMed Scopus (2856) Google Scholar). Three-dimensional renderings of the distal 3.5 mm of the femora were reconstructed using two-dimensional data from scanned slices with the 3D creator software (Skyscan). The trabecular bone region of interest was drawn to include all cancellous bone in the metaphysis. Lumbar vertebrae were dissected, fixed for 24 h in 4% formalin, dehydrated in a graded ethanol series, and embedded in methyl methacrylate resin, and 7-μm sections were made (27.Marulanda J. Gao C. Roman H. Henderson J.E. Murshed M. Prevention of arterial calcification corrects the low bone mass phenotype in MOP-deficient mice.Bone. 2013; 57: 499-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Von Kossa/van Gieson staining was done, and histomorphometric analyses were made with Osteomeasure software (OsteoMetrics Inc.). The parameters comply with the guidelines of the American Society of Bone and Mineral Research nomenclature committee (28.Dempster D.W. Compston J.E. Drezner M.K. Glorieux F.H. Kanis J.A. Malluche H.

For analysis of osteoblasts, osteocytes, and osteoclasts, 5-μm sections were stained with toluidine blue and tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase, respectively. Images were taken at room temperature using a light microscope (DM200; Leica) with a 20× (numerical aperture of 0.40) or 40× (numerical aperture of 0.65) objective. All histological images were captured using a camera (DP72; Olympus), acquired with DP2-BSW software (XV3.0; Olympus), and processed using Photoshop (Adobe). To evaluate osteoblast apoptosis the TUNEL assay was performed on undecalcified vertebral sections (see above) using the Deadend Fluorometric TUNEL System kit (Promega). Images were captured on an EVOS FL Digital Inverted Fluorescent Microscope (Fisher). Calcein (Sigma; C-0875) was dissolved in buffer (0.15 m NaCl, 2% NaHCO3) and injected twice intraperitoneally (25 μg/g body weight) at 9 and 2 days before the mice were killed (29.Richard C. Huo R. Samadfam R. Bolivar I. Miao D. Brown E.M. Hendy G.N. Goltzman D. The calcium-sensing receptor and 25-hydroxyvitamin D-1α-hydroxylase interact to modulate skeletal growth and bone turnover.J. Bone Miner. Res. 2010; 25: 1627-1636Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Bones were harvested and embedded in plastic as described above. Serial sections were cut, and the freshly cut surface of each section was viewed and imaged using fluorescence microscopy. The double calcein-labeled width was measured using Osteomeasure software, and the mineral apposition rate (MAR = interlabel width/labeling period), bone formation rate/bone surface (BS), and mineralizing surface (MS)/BS were calculated. Calculations were made on a minimum of duplicate specimens from replicate mice of each group. Bone marrow cells were collected from mouse long bones under aseptic conditions as described previously (30.Boraschi-Diaz I. Komarova S.V. The protocol for the isolation and cryopreservation of osteoclast precursors from mouse bone marrow and spleen.Cytotechnology. 2014; 10.1007/s10616-014-9759-3PubMed Google Scholar) and were cultured overnight with M-CSF (25 ng/ml Preprotech; 300–25). The following day non-adherent precursors were plated at 5 × 104 cells/cm2 and treated with M-CSF (50 ng/ml) and recombinant soluble RANKL (50 ng/ml) (31.Manolson M.F. Yu H. Chen W. Yao Y. Li K.

Bone marrow cells were plated at 1.5 × 106 cells/cm2 and cultured in α-minimal essential medium (αMEM, Invitrogen; 12000–022) supplemented with 10% FBS (Wisent; 080152), with 1% sodium pyruvate (Wisent; 600–110-EL), and 1% penicillin-streptomycin (Wisent; 450–201-EL) and 0.02 m sodium bicarbonate (Sigma; S5761–500G). One day after plating, 50 μg/ml l-ascorbic acid (Sigma; A8960–5G) was added to induce osteoblast differentiation. Every other day the medium was changed, and freshly prepared ascorbic acid was added. On day 8, samples were fixed with 10% formalin in PBS, pH 7.4, for 8–9 min at room temperature and stained for alkaline phosphatase (ALP; Fast Red, Sigma; F4381) or tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP, Sigma; 387A). For each well five images were taken at pre-defined positions, and the color intensity was analyzed using Image J software (imagej.nih.gov). Osteoclast numbers were quantified by counting TRAP-positive cells with three or more nuclei and intact membrane. Co-cultures on glass coverslips were fixed on day 9 with 10% formalin, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 (Fisher; BP151-100) in PBS for 10 min, incubated for 20 min at room temperature with a red fluorescent Alexa Fluor 568 tagged phalloidin (Invitrogen; A12380), washed 3 times in PBS and once with distilled water, and incubated with 0.2 μg/ml of 40,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride (DAPI) in distilled water for 5 min. Slides were washed three times with distilled water and mounted on microscope slides using mounting media (Thermo Scientific; 9990402). Images were recorded using an inverted fluorescence microscope (Eclipse TE2000-U, Nikon) and cooled charge-coupled device camera (Hamamatsu Photonics) supported by Volocity software (Perkin Elmer) (32.Rafiei S. Komarova S.V. Molecular signaling pathways mediating osteoclastogenesis induced by prostate cancer cells.BMC Cancer. 2013; 13: 605Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Osteoblasts from calvaria of individual 1–2-week-old OC-Cre;Men1f/f pups or their control littermates were isolated as described (33.Murshed M. Harmey D. Millán J.L. McKee M.D. Karsenty G. Unique coexpression in osteoblasts of broadly expressed genes accounts for the spatial restriction of ECM mineralization to bone.Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 1093-1104Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar). The bones were dissected free of sutures and subjected to 2 consecutive digestions at 37 °C with shaking in αMEM medium (Invitrogen) containing 0.1 mg/ml collagenase P (Roche Applied Science) and 0.25% trypsin/0.1% EDTA (Invitrogen), The supernatant was discarded leaving the pieces of bone. Fresh digestion medium containing 0.2 mg collagenase P/ml was added, and calvaria were incubated at 37 °C with vigorous shaking every 15 min for 45 min or until bone pieces began to fall apart. The bone pieces and cells were collected by centrifugation (1500 × g), washed with αMEM, and plated in a 10-cm dish with αMEM containing 10% FBS and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen). After 4 days, the medium was changed, and when the cells reached 80% confluency they were passaged to 6-well plates (105 cells/well). After reaching ∼70% confluency, the medium was supplemented with 10 mm β-glycerophosphate and 50 μg/μl ascorbic acid (Sigma), and this osteogenic medium was replaced every 3 days. Osteoblasts from calvaria of individual 5–6 month-old OC-Cre;Men1f/f mice or their control littermates were isolated as described (34.Bakker A.D. Klein-Nulend J. Osteoblast isolation from murine calvaria and long bones.Methods Mol. Biol. 2012; 816: 19-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Calvaria were dissected and transferred to a Petri dish containing PBS, and soft tissues were removed by scraping the bone with a scalpel. Sutures were removed, and the rest of the calvaria was chopped into small fragments. The fragments were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C with shaking in 2 mg of collagenase II/ml αMEM (Bioshop Inc), the supernatant was discarded, and the procedure was repeated. Calvaria were then incubated for 30 min at 37 °C with shaking in a 0.25% trypsin, 0.1% EDTA solution. The supernatant was discarded and replaced by fresh collagenase II solution for the fourth and final incubation step of 30 min at 37 °C. Bone pieces were washed 3 times with αMEM containing 10"
https://openalex.org/W1986147729,"The RNA-binding protein Tristetraprolin (TTP, ZFP36) functions as a tumor suppressor that impairs the development and disables the maintenance of MYC-driven lymphoma. In addition, other human cancers expressed reduced levels of TTP, suggesting that it may function as a tumor suppressor in several malignancies. To identify genes that may be associated with TTP tumor suppressor functions in human cancer, we analyzed The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) breast cancer, lung adenocarcinoma, lung squamous cell carcinoma, and colon adenocarcinoma datasets. These analyses defined a signature of 50 genes differentially regulated between high and low TTP-expressing tumors. Notably, patients with low TTP-expressing breast cancer and lung adenocarcinoma had decreased survival rates and more aggressive tumors with increased necrosis. In addition, analysis across non-TCGA tumor gene expression databases identified a broad spectrum of human cancers having similarities with the TTP-low tumor gene signature, including pancreatic, bladder, and prostate cancer. TTP has documented roles in regulating mRNAs encoding inflammatory proteins, and pathway analysis identified several inflammatory pathways that are altered in tumors with low TTP expression. Surprisingly, the TTP-low tumor gene signature includes a core component of 20 under-expressed CREB target genes, suggesting that the regulation of CREB activity may be related to the tumor suppressor function of TTP. Thus, reduced levels of TTP are a potential biomarker for human cancers with poor outcome, and targeting the CREB pathway may be a therapeutic route for treating aggressive TTP-low tumors."
https://openalex.org/W2092993321,"Recent evidence has indicated the presence of novel plastoquinone-binding sites, QC and QD, in photosystem II (PSII). Here, we investigated the potential involvement of loosely bound plastosemiquinones in superoxide anion radical (O2-) formation in spinach PSII membranes using electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spin-trapping spectroscopy. Illumination of PSII membranes in the presence of the spin trap EMPO (5-(ethoxycarbonyl)-5-methyl-1-pyrroline N-oxide) resulted in the formation of O2-, which was monitored by the appearance of EMPO-OOH adduct EPR signal. Addition of exogenous short-chain plastoquinone to PSII membranes markedly enhanced the EMPO-OOH adduct EPR signal. Both in the unsupplemented and plastoquinone-supplemented PSII membranes, the EMPO-OOH adduct EPR signal was suppressed by 50% when the urea-type herbicide DCMU (3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea) was bound at the QB site. However, the EMPO-OOH adduct EPR signal was enhanced by binding of the phenolic-type herbicide dinoseb (2,4-dinitro-6-sec-butylphenol) at the QD site. Both in the unsupplemented and plastoquinone-supplemented PSII membranes, DCMU and dinoseb inhibited photoreduction of the high-potential form of cytochrome b559 (cyt b559). Based on these results, we propose that O2- is formed via the reduction of molecular oxygen by plastosemiquinones formed through one-electron reduction of plastoquinone at the QB site and one-electron oxidation of plastoquinol by cyt b559 at the QC site. On the contrary, the involvement of a plastosemiquinone formed via the one-electron oxidation of plastoquinol by cyt b559 at the QD site seems to be ambiguous. In spite of the fact that the existence of QC and QD sites is not generally accepted yet, the present study provided more spectroscopic data on the potential functional role of these new plastoquinone-binding sites."

Methods 112 patients with life-threatening hemoptysis due to tuberculosis underwent bronchial artery embolization from January 2004 to February 2014. Life-threatening hemoptysis was defined as expectoration of at least 400 ml of blood in 24 hour. The median follow-up is 20 months, ranging from 2 to 52 months. Results The hemoptysis control rate was 86.6% at 14 days, 84.8% at 30 days, 78.6% at 240 days, 75.9% at 360 days, respectively. None of these characteristics, including gender, age and tuberculosis status, was significantly associated with immediate control of bleeding. Patients with active tuberculosis had a significantly longer recurrence-free duration than did patients with inactive tuberculosis (P = 0.040), which was further confirmed by Cox regression hazards model (P = 0.046). There was no spinal cord complication or mortality related to bronchial artery embolization. The most common complication was transient chest pain. Conclusion Bronchial arterial embolization is an effective and safe technique in the management of life-threatening hemoptysis secondary to tuberculosis. Active tuberculosis may be associated with a lower rate of recurrence of hemoptysis."

We used human Tau purified from yeast models to generate new monoclonal antibodies, of which three were further characterized. The first antibody, ADx201, binds the Tau proline-rich region independently of the phosphorylation status, whereas the second, ADx215, detects an epitope formed by the Tau N terminus when Tau is not phosphorylated at Tyr18. For the third antibody, ADx210, the binding site could not be determined because its epitope is probably conformational. All three antibodies stained tangle-like structures in different brain sections of THY-Tau22 transgenic mice and Alzheimer patients, and ADx201 and ADx210 also detected neuritic plaques in the cortex of the patient brains. In hippocampal homogenates from THY-Tau22 mice and cortex homogenates obtained from Alzheimer patients, ADx215 consistently stained specific low order Tau oligomers in diseased brain, which in size correspond to Tau dimers. ADx201 and ADx210 additionally reacted to higher order Tau oligomers and presumed prefibrillar structures in the patient samples. Our data further suggest that formation of the low order Tau oligomers marks an early disease stage that is initiated by Tau phosphorylation at N-terminal sites. Formation of higher order oligomers appears to require additional phosphorylation in the C terminus of Tau. When used to assess Tau levels in human cerebrospinal fluid, the antibodies permitted us to discriminate patients with Alzheimer disease or other dementia like vascular dementia, indicative that these antibodies hold promising diagnostic potential.

https://openalex.org/W2016293532,"Wheat (Triticum aestivum L.)/faba bean (Vicia faba L.) intercropping shows significant overyielding and high nitrogen (N)-use efficiency, but the dynamics of plant interactions have rarely been estimated. The objective of the present study was to investigate the temporal dynamics of competitive N acquisition between intercropped wheat and faba bean with the logistic model. Wheat and faba bean were grown together or alone with limited N supply in pots. Data of shoot and root biomass and N content measured from 14 samplings were fitted to logistic models to determine instantaneous rates of growth and N uptake. The superiority of instantaneous biomass production and N uptake shifted from faba bean to wheat with their growth. Moreover, the shift of superiority on N uptake occurred 7–12 days earlier than that of biomass production. Interspecific competition stimulated intercropped wheat to have a much earlier and stronger superiority on instantaneous N uptake compared with isolated wheat. The modeling methodology characterized the temporal dynamics of biomass production and N uptake of intercropped wheat and faba bean in different planting systems, which helps to understand the underlying process of plant interaction for intercropping plants."
https://openalex.org/W2033549736,"Background High mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) plays important roles in a large variety of diseases; glycyrrhizin (GL) is recognized as an HMGB1 inhibitor. However, few studies have focused on whether glycyrrhizin can potentially improve the outcome of traumatic pancreatitis (TP) by inhibiting HMGB1. Methods A total of 60 male Wistar rats were randomly divided into three groups (n = 20 in each): Control group, TP group and TP-GL group. Pancreatic trauma was established with a custom-made biological impact machine-III, and GL was administered at 15 minutes after the accomplishment of operation. To determine survival rates during the first 7 days after injury, another 60 rats (n = 20 in each) were grouped and treated as mentioned above. At 24 hours of induction of TP, the histopathological changes in pancreas were evaluated and serum amylase levels were tested. Serum tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α), interleukin 6 (IL-6), and HMGB1 were measured using enzyme linked immunosorbent assay. HMGB1 expressions in pancreas were measured using immunohistochemical staining, Western blot and Real-Time PCR analysis. Results Serum levels of HMGB1, TNF-α and IL-6 were increased dramatically in TP group at 24 hours after induction of TP. However, these indicators were reduced significantly by GL administration in TP-GL group comparing with TP group (P<0.05). Meanwhile, survival analysis showed that the seven-day survival rate in TP-GL group was significantly higher than that in TP group (85% versus 65%, P<0.05). GL treatment significantly decreased the pancreatic protein and mRNA expressions of HMGB1 and ameliorated the pancreatic injury in rats with TP. Conclusions Glycyrrhizin might play an important role in improving survival rates and ameliorating pancreatic injury of TP by suppression of the expressions of HMGB1 and other proinflammatory cytokine."
https://openalex.org/W1989740486,"One of the biggest challenges in the study of biological regulatory mechanisms is the integration, americanmodeling, and analysis of the complex interactions which take place in biological networks. Despite post transcriptional regulatory elements (i.e., miRNAs) are widely investigated in current research, their usage and visualization in biological networks is very limited. Regulatory networks are commonly limited to gene entities. To integrate networks with post transcriptional regulatory data, researchers are therefore forced to manually resort to specific third party databases. In this context, we introduce ReNE, a Cytoscape 3.x plugin designed to automatically enrich a standard gene-based regulatory network with more detailed transcriptional, post transcriptional, and translational data, resulting in an enhanced network that more precisely models the actual biological regulatory mechanisms. ReNE can automatically import a network layout from the Reactome or KEGG repositories, or work with custom pathways described using a standard OWL/XML data format that the Cytoscape import procedure accepts. Moreover, ReNE allows researchers to merge multiple pathways coming from different sources. The merged network structure is normalized to guarantee a consistent and uniform description of the network nodes and edges and to enrich all integrated data with additional annotations retrieved from genome-wide databases like NCBI, thus producing a pathway fully manageable through the Cytoscape environment. The normalized network is then analyzed to include missing transcription factors, miRNAs, and proteins. The resulting enhanced network is still a fully functional Cytoscape network where each regulatory element (transcription factor, miRNA, gene, protein) and regulatory mechanism (up-regulation/down-regulation) is clearly visually identifiable, thus enabling a better visual understanding of its role and the effect in the network behavior. The enhanced network produced by ReNE is exportable in multiple formats for further analysis via third party applications. ReNE can be freely installed from the Cytoscape App Store (http://apps.cytoscape.org/apps/rene) and the full source code is freely available for download through a SVN repository accessible at http://www.sysbio.polito.it/tools_svn/BioInformatics/Rene/releases/. ReNE enhances a network by only integrating data from public repositories, without any inference or prediction. The reliability of the introduced interactions only depends on the reliability of the source data, which is out of control of ReNe developers."
https://openalex.org/W1995301302,"Purpose The quadrivalent HPV vaccination was approved for use in males ages 9 to 26 in 2009 and recommended for routine administration in 2011. The purpose of this study was to uncover predictable commonalities amongst parents who chose to vaccinate their 11–17 year old sons against HPV. Methods We compiled data from a U.S. national sample of 779 parents with sons 11–17 years old using a web-based survey to gather information about behavioral and sociodemographic factors which predicted receipt of 1 or more HPV vaccine doses based on parental report. Predictors were first modeled individually for univariable associations. Significant predictors (p<0.10) were combined in a multivariable model. Results In the adjusted model, independent predictors included receipt of flu vaccination, health insurance coverage and sexual health topic discussions with sons. Sons who had received a flu shot in the last two years more frequently received at least one dose of the vaccine (OR 1.82; 95% CI 1.45–2.26). Sons covered by private health insurance had decreased odds of HPV vaccination (OR 0.56 95% CI 0.37–0.83). Lastly, parents who had discussed sexual health topics with their sons were more likely to vaccinate (OR 1.61; 95% CI 1.37–1.89). Conclusions Male vaccination rates in the U.S. have increased, but males continue to be under-immunized. Utilization of health care is an important factor in HPV vaccine uptake; therefore, health care providers should use every contact as an opportunity to vaccinate. Communication about sexual health topics may provide a forum for parents and health care providers to have conversations about HPV vaccination as those more comfortable discussing these topics may also be more comfortable discussing HPV vaccination."

Monitoring retention is an important tool for evaluating the quality of care.A review of medical records of HIV-infected children was performed in three health facilities in the DRC: the Amo-Congo Health center, the Monkole Clinic in Kinshasa, and the HEAL Africa Clinic in Goma. Medical records of 720 children were included. Kaplan Meier curves were constructed with the probability of retention at 6 months, 1 year, 2 years and 3 years. Retention rates were: 88.2% (95% CI: 85.1%-90.8%) at 6 months; 85% (95% CI: 81.5%-87.6%) at one year; 79.4% (95%CI: 75.5%-82.8%) at two years and 74.7% (95% CI: 70.5%-78.5%) at 3 years. The retention varied across study sites: 88.2%, 66.6% and 92.5% at 6 months; 84%, 59% and 90% at 12 months and 75.7%, 56.3% and 85.8% at 24 months respectively for Amo-Congo/Kasavubu, Monkole facility and HEAL Africa. After multivariable Cox regression four variables remained independently associated with attrition: study site, CD4 cell count <350 cells/µL, children younger than 2 years and children whose caregivers were member of an independent church.Attrition remains a challenge for pediatric HIV positive patients in ART programs in DRC. In addition, the low coverage of pediatric treatment exacerbates the situation of pediatric HIV/AIDS."
https://openalex.org/W1972994475,"The effectiveness of a vaccine is determined not only by the immunogenicity of its components, but especially by how widely it covers the disease-causing strains circulating in a given region. Because vaccine coverage varies over time, this study aimed to detect possible changes that could affect vaccine protection during a specific period in a southern European region. The 4CMenB vaccine is licensed for use in Europe, Canada, and Australia and is mainly directed against Neisseria meningitidis serogroup B. This vaccine contains four main immunogenic components: three recombinant proteins, FHbp, Nhba and NadA, and an outer membrane vesicle [PorA P1.4]. The allelic distribution of FHbp, Nhba, NadA, and PorA antigens in 82 invasive isolates (B and non-B serogroups) isolated from January 2008 to December 2013 were analyzed. 4CMenB was likely protective against 61.8% and 50% of serogroup B and non-B meningococci, respectively, in the entire period, but between 2012 and 2013, the predicted protection fell below 45% (42.1% for serogroup B isolates).The observed decreasing trend in the predicted protection during the 6 years of the study (Χ2 for trend = 4.68, p = 0.03) coincided with a progressive decrease of several clonal complexes (e.g., cc11, cc32 and cc41/44), which had one or more antigens against which the vaccine would offer protection."

The whole SEZ of the lateral ventricle was dissected and dissociated in sucrose solution (150 mm sucrose, 125 mm NaCl, 3.5 mm KCl, 1.2 mm NaH2PO4, 2.4 mm CaCl2, 1.3 mm MgCl2, 6.65 mm glucose, and 2 mm HEPES, pH 6.9, osmolarity 326 mm, all from Sigma), and cells were processed for sorting as already described (17.Cesetti T. Fila T. Obernier K. Bengtson C.P. Li Y. Mandl C. Hölzl-Wenig G. Ciccolini F. GABAA receptor signaling induces osmotic swelling and cell cycle activation of neonatal prominin+ precursors.Stem Cells. 2011; 29: 307-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Briefly, after enzymatic tissue dissociation, cells were incubated with prominin-1-APC antibodies (Miltenyi Biotec) and then stained with Alexa488-tagged EGF (EGF-A; 20 ng/ml) (Molecular Probes) and 1 μg/ml propidium iodide, 0.001% DNase (all from Sigma). Before sorting, bicuculline methobromide (50 μm) (Biotrend) was added to dissection and sort solution for 30 min. After sorting, cells were plated on Matrigel-coated 12-well chamber slides (Ibis) in neurobasal (NBA) (Invitrogen) media, 2% B27, 2 mm l-glutamine, penicillin 100 units/ml, 100 μg/ml streptomycin (all from Sigma), 10 ng/ml FGF-2 (PeproTech) and analyzed by live imaging or were fixed and processed for immunocytochemistry after 6 or 24 h, as described in the text. Neurosphere cultures were established from the dissociated SEZ of WT and AQP4 KO neonatal mice in NBA medium supplemented with 2% B27, 10 ng/ml FGF-2, and 20 ng/ml EGF-2 (PeproTech), as described previously (17.Cesetti T. Fila T. Obernier K. Bengtson C.P. Li Y. Mandl C. Hölzl-Wenig G. Ciccolini F. GABAA receptor signaling induces osmotic swelling and cell cycle activation of neonatal prominin+ precursors.Stem Cells. 2011; 29: 307-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Cells were fixed and immunostained with or without previous permeabilization as described previously (30.Ciccolini F. Svendsen C.N. Fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF-2) promotes acquisition of epidermal growth factor (EGF) responsiveness in mouse striatal precursor cells: identification of neural precursors responding to both EGF and FGF-2.J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 7869-7880Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Before fixation, and 6 h after plating, cells were incubated with bicuculline (50 μm, up to 30 min) or muscimol (25 μm, up to 15 min), with or without 30 min of pretreatment with brefeldin-A (BFA 3 μg/ml) as described in the text. Primary antibodies were detected using Alexa 488- or Cy3-conjugated secondary antibodies (Molecular Probes). Rabbit polyclonal to AQP4 (Abcam, 1:500), mouse monoclonal to GABAAR β-chain antibody (Chemicon 1:200), and EGFR (Sigma, 1:200) primary antibodies were used on permeabilized or nonpermeabilized cell and tissue sections, as indicated. Nuclei were counterstained with 4,6-diamidine-2-phenylindol dihydrochloride (DAPI) 1:1000 (Roche Diagnostics). Immunopositive cells were quantified from at least three independent experiments by analyzing an average of 300 cells across multiple fields with a conventional fluorescence microscope (DMIRBE Microscope; Leica, Germany). Changes in expression were evaluated by calculating the number of immunopositive cells as percentage of DAPI. Adult mice were deeply anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of sodium pentobarbital (2 ml/kg body weight; Narcoren®, Merial, Germany) and perfused transcardially with 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 m phosphate buffer. Brains were post-fixed overnight in 4% paraformaldehyde at 4 °C and transferred into a 20% sucrose solution. After embedding in 4% low melting agarose, 30-μm thick coronal vibratome sections were cut and processed for immunohistochemistry. Image acquisition and analysis were done as described previously (17.Cesetti T. Fila T. Obernier K. Bengtson C.P. Li Y. Mandl C. Hölzl-Wenig G. Ciccolini F. GABAA receptor signaling induces osmotic swelling and cell cycle activation of neonatal prominin+ precursors.Stem Cells. 2011; 29: 307-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Lysates of homogenized tissue were obtained in Membrane extraction buffer (5 mm HEPES, 0.32 m sucrose, 0.1 mm EDTA) and/or whole cell lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm DTT, pH 7.4) supplemented with PhosphoStop (Sigma) and protease inhibitor mixture complete (Roche Diagnostics). Cell extracts (300 μg) were immunoprecipitated with AQP4 antibody (2 μg) using Dynabeads Protein G (Novex). Finally, proteins were fractionated by SDS-PAGE and incubated with antibodies to AQP4 (Abcam 1:1000) or to phosphoserine (Millipore, 1:500). Proximity ligation assay (PLA) was used to visualize in situ protein interaction (31.Söderberg O. Gullberg M. Jarvius M. Ridderstråle K. Leuchowius K.J. Jarvius J. Wester K. Hydbring P. Bahram F.

Res. 2012; 111: 201-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) because it is based on dual recognition of epitopes, which can be detected only if they are localized less than 40 nm apart. Here, we used PLAs to investigate the proximity of AQP4 and GABAAR and changes in serine phosphorylation associated with AQP4. PLAs were performed using the Duolink kit (Olink Bioscience, Uppsala, Sweden). Briefly, isolated precursor cells or brain slices were blocked with 5% diluted FCS for 30 min at room temperature. Antibodies against AQP4, in combination with either GABAAR or phosphoserine antibodies, were diluted in PBS containing 1% FCS at suitable concentrations and were incubated overnight at 4 °C. Oligonucleotide-bound secondary antibodies and additional oligonucleotides were ligated for the generation of a circular DNA substrate that was amplified and detected by means of fluorescent complementary oligonucleotides according to the manufacturer's instructions. Quantitative analysis was done by calculating the percentage of cells displaying fluorescent dots, revealing colocalization of the primary antibodies. Alternatively, when indicated in the text, cells were subdivided into groups based on the number of the displayed fluorescent signals, and the effect of the treatment was quantified by calculating the percentage of the total cells in each group. Mice were fully anesthetized and set into a stereotactic frame. Vaseline was placed over the eyes of the animals to prevent them from drying. Mice were given bilateral intraventricular injection with 1.2 μl of vehicle, bicuculline (30 pmol), muscimol (3 nmol), or hypo-osmotic solution at a rate of 0.4 μl/min with a 33-guage stainless steel guided cannula. The following stereotactic coordinates were used to target the lateral ventricle on both sides of the brain: AP = 0 mm, ML = ±1.2 mm, V = −2.0 mm from the bregma. The cannula was left in place for 5 min following the injection. Mice were sacrificed 30–60 min after the injection and were processed for immunohistochemistry or water retention experiments. After dissection, the tissue was supersonicated in tubes. The tubes containing the different tissue samples were weighted before and after drying in a Fistreem vacuum oven for 24 h at 80 °C and −1.000 mbar. Brain water accumulation was calculated by comparing values for baseline brain water content with the tissue water content after treatment. The percentage of water content per tissue sample was calculated as (wet mass − dry mass) × 100/(wet mass) (22.Haj-Yasein N.N. Vindedal G.F. Eilert-Olsen M. Gundersen G.A. Skare Ø. Laake P.

U.S.A. 2011; 108: 17815-17820Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). For osmotic swelling measured by live imaging, the sorted cells were loaded with calcein-AM (1 μm) (Invitrogen) diluted in Hanks' buffered salt solution (HBSS, 1.3 mm CaCl2, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 0.4 mm MgSO4, 5.4 mm KCl, 0.44 mm KH2PO4, 4.2 mm NaHCO3, 137 mm NaCl, 0.25 mm Na2HPO4, and 5.6 mm glucose) for 30 min at 37 °C. Recordings were performed at 37 °C in an open-topped perfusion chamber (Life Imaging Service, Switzerland) mounted in an inverted fluorescent microscope (IX70 Olympus, Germany) equipped with a CCD camera (ImagoQE, TILL Photonics GmbH, Germany) and a software interface (TILLvisION 4.0, TILL Photonics GmbH, Germany). Excitation light of 390 nm was generated by a monochromator (Polychrom IV, TILL Photonics GmbH, Germany) coupled to a xenon short arc light source (USHIO, Japan). After incubation with bicuculline (50 μm, up to 30 min) or muscimol (25 μm, up to 15 min), as indicated in the text, cultures were treated with hypo-osmotic (200 mosm/kg), hyper-osmotic (400 mosm/kg), or iso-osmotic solution (300 mosm/kg) as control for an additional 30 min. Different osmolarity reflected variations in NaCl or d-gluconic acid sodium salt used to obtain hyper-osmotic Cl− free solution. Recordings were performed after the cells had adapted to the environment for 15–20 min. Images were taken every 10 s. Changes in cell size were calculated using ImageJ software. All data came from at least three independent experiments from different cell preparations. For volume analysis by spinning disk confocal microscopy, sorted P+ cells were treated with bicuculline (50 μm) or left untreated as control for 30 min at 37 °C before loading with wheat germ agglutinin-Alexa 488 (5 μg/ml) (Invitrogen) for 10 min. After rinsing with pre-warmed HBSS, the cells were incubated at 37 °C for a further 15 min before fixation. Images of confocal sections were taken every 0.15 μm using a spinning-disk confocal system, merged together and converted by deconvolution methods. Changes in cell size were calculated using ImageJ software. All data were collected from 20 to 30 cells from three independent experiments from different cell preparations. Osmotic swelling was also measured by flow cytometry in cell suspensions. Changes in forward scattering (FSC) reflected variations in the osmolarity of the medium and were analyzed using FACSDiva 6.1.3. FACS histograms illustrating the frequency distribution of FSC were fitted with SigmaPlot by single Gaussian functions whose mean, S.D., and adjusted R-squared values were calculated. The statistical significance of the variations between control and treated groups was calculated using Student's t test. Cells were sorted into lysis buffer, and the total RNA was extracted with RNeasy micro kit (Qiagen). Total RNA was reversely transcribed using oligo(dT) primers and Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase, RNase H Minus (all from Promega). TaqMan probes for genes of interest were purchased from Applied Biosystems. The quantitative reverse transcription (qRT)-PCR was performed in 7300 Real Time PCR system from Applied Biosystems. Cycle threshold (Ct) values were obtained from the logarithmic phase of the amplification plot between normalized fluorescence of a Fam reporter dye for the TaqMan MGB probe and cycle numbers for the PCR. Ct values for the genes of interest were normalized against β-actin. Expression levels of the genes of interest in different cell types were normalized to P−/Elow cells. The data are represented as means ± S.E. and analyzed using SigmaStat 3.5 or analysis of live imaging experiments means of averaged values for each time point were compared between control and treatment. In the figure are given the highest p values obtained. Statistical significance was determined by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) for multiple comparisons followed by Bonferroni post hoc test or the two-tailed Student's t test using a statistical package (GraphPad Prism). Calculated p values are indicated in the figure as follows: * and #, p ≤ 0.05; ** and ##, p ≤ 0.01; *** and ###, p ≤ 0.001. Previous studies have shown that AQP4 is expressed in neurosphere cultures derived from adult murine and human neural precursors (20.Cavazzin C. Ferrari D. Facchetti F. Russignan A. Vescovi A.L. La Porta C.A. Gritti A. Unique expression and localization of aquaporin-4 and aquaporin-9 in murine and human neural stem cells and in their glial progeny.Glia. 2006; 53: 167-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). However, the distribution of AQP4 in the different precursor types of the SEZ is still unknown. To investigate this issue, we used flow cytometry to measure expression levels of EGFR and prominin-1 and purify the following cell populations from the SEZ of neonatal mice: P+/Elow cells consisting of ependymal cells and quiescent NSCs; P+/Ehigh cells being highly enriched in activated NSCs; P−/Ehigh cells enriched in TAPs and pre-neuroblasts; and P−/Elow cells representing mostly neuroblasts (7.Carrillo-García C.

GABAA receptor signaling induces osmotic swelling and cell cycle activation of neonatal prominin+ precursors.Stem Cells. 2011; 29: 307-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). To investigate the relationship between GABAARs and water channels, we first analyzed the expression of AQP4 in these four populations. Analysis by qRT-PCR revealed increased mRNA levels in P+ cells. In particular, P+/Ehigh-activated NSCs contained approximately six times more Aqp4 transcripts than isolated neuroblasts and P−/Ehigh cells (Fig. 1A). A similar expression pattern was also observed upon analysis of AQP4 protein by immunofluorescence, showing an increased number of immunopositive cells and higher levels of fluorescence in the sorted P+ cells than in the remaining P− populations (Fig. 1B). As we had previously found that neural precursors display benzodiazepine-sensitive GABAARs, we next investigated by qRT-PCR the expression of GABAAR α subunits (gabra) 1, 2, 3, and 5, which confer high affinity binding of benzodiazepines, and of gabra 4 and GABAARδ subunits (gabrd), which are not associated with benzodiazepine sensitivity. We selected these subunits because our previous analyses (17.Cesetti T. Fila T. Obernier K. Bengtson C.P. Li Y. Mandl C. Hölzl-Wenig G. Ciccolini F. GABAA receptor signaling induces osmotic swelling and cell cycle activation of neonatal prominin+ precursors.Stem Cells. 2011; 29: 307-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) had revealed that they were all expressed at very low levels in neural precursors. Indeed, transcript levels for all genes analyzed were significantly lower within the remaining populations than in purified P−/Elow neuroblasts. Although gabra2 and gabra4 were detected in all isolated populations (Fig. 1C), transcripts for the subunits gabrd and the remaining gabra subunits were not detected in P+/Ehigh-activated NSCs (data not shown). This suggests that gabra2 subunits are responsible for the sensitivity to benzo"
https://openalex.org/W2153559706,"Although egg color is generally consistent within individual birds and robust to environmental variation, recent evidence suggests a degree of susceptibility to environmental perturbation or modulation of egg color. Most of this variation manifests via the physiology of the laying female, but some direct impacts of the environment on laid eggs have also been discovered. Here we test whether light changes bird egg color and we quantify its effect, by subjecting variable blue-green eggs of Rüppell's weaver (Ploceus galbula) to a broad-spectrum light source under laboratory conditions, and measuring egg reflectance every few hours. Eggshells gradually decreased in reflectance across the entire measured wavelength spectrum of 250-800 nm. Reflectance peaks were disproportionately affected, such that the height decreased of both the blue-green peak and the smaller UV peak typical of blue-green eggs. The reflectance of lighter eggs was affected slightly more than that of darker eggs. These changes are similar to previous results for changes over long periods of time in darkness, suggesting that light might hasten the same process of pigment degradation that proceeds even without light. Comparison between the experimental light source and both sunlight and typical artificial lighting situations raises the possibility that significant color change might occur during incubation in some birds, but indicates that eggshell illumination in museums for short periods of study is unlikely to affect their color to a detectable extent. Additional research should be performed on eggs of other species and in other light environments, with an eye to an eventual generalized model of the effect of light on eggshell color."
https://openalex.org/W2086085321,"To evaluate respiratory motion of a patient by generating four-dimensional digital tomosynthesis (4D DTS), extracting respiratory signal from patients' on-board projection data, and ensuring the feasibility of 4D DTS as a localization tool for the targets which have respiratory movement.Four patients with lung and liver cancer were included to verify the feasibility of 4D-DTS with an on-board imager. CBCT acquisition (650-670 projections) was used to reconstruct 4D DTS images and the breath signal of the patients was generated by extracting the motion of diaphragm during data acquisition. Based on the extracted signal, the projection data was divided into four phases: peak-exhale phase, mid-inhale phase, peak-inhale phase, and mid-exhale phase. The binned projection data was then used to generate 4D DTS, where the total scan angle was assigned as ±22.5° from rotation center, centered on 0° and 180° for coronal ""half-fan"" 4D DTS, and 90° and 270° for sagittal ""half-fan"" 4D DTS. The result was then compared with 4D CBCT which we have also generated with the same phase distribution.The motion of the diaphragm was evident from the 4D DTS results for peak-exhale, mid-inhale, peak-inhale and mid-exhale phase assignment which was absent in 3D DTS. Compared to the result of 4D CBCT, the view aliasing effect due to arbitrary angle reconstruction was less severe. In addition, the severity of metal artifacts, the image distortion due to presence of metal, was less than that of the 4D CBCT results.We have implemented on-board 4D DTS on patients data to visualize the movement of anatomy due to respiratory motion. The results indicate that 4D-DTS could be a promising alternative to 4D CBCT for acquiring the respiratory motion of internal organs just prior to radiotherapy treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2158310427,"Background Two recent reports have identified the Endothelial Protein C Receptor (EPCR) as a key molecule implicated in severe malaria pathology. First, it was shown that EPCR in the human microvasculature mediates sequestration of Plasmodium falciparum-infected erythrocytes. Second, microvascular thrombosis, one of the major processes causing cerebral malaria, was linked to a reduction in EPCR expression in cerebral endothelial layers. It was speculated that genetic variation affecting EPCR functionality could influence susceptibility to severe malaria phenotypes, rendering PROCR, the gene encoding EPCR, a promising candidate for an association study. Methods Here, we performed an association study including high-resolution variant discovery of rare and frequent genetic variants in the PROCR gene. The study group, which previously has proven to be a valuable tool for studying the genetics of malaria, comprised 1,905 severe malaria cases aged 1–156 months and 1,866 apparently healthy children aged 2–161 months from the Ashanti Region in Ghana, West Africa, where malaria is highly endemic. Association of genetic variation with severe malaria phenotypes was examined on the basis of single variants, reconstructed haplotypes, and rare variant analyses. Results A total of 41 genetic variants were detected in regulatory and coding regions of PROCR, 17 of which were previously unknown genetic variants. In association tests, none of the single variants, haplotypes or rare variants showed evidence for an association with severe malaria, cerebral malaria, or severe malaria anemia. Conclusion Here we present the first analysis of genetic variation in the PROCR gene in the context of severe malaria in African subjects and show that genetic variation in the PROCR gene in our study population does not influence susceptibility to major severe malaria phenotypes."

In this work, we employed two different strategies to mechanically stress cancer cells. The cancer and healthy cell populations were treated either with mechanical stress delivered by a micropump (fabricated by deep X-ray nanolithography) or by ultrasound wave stimuli. A specific down-regulation of Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) class I molecules expression on cancer cell membrane compared to different kinds of healthy cells (fibroblasts, macrophages, dendritic and lymphocyte cells) was observed, stimulating the cells with forces in the range of nano-newton, and pressures between 1 and 10 bar (1 bar = 100.000 Pascal), depending on the devices used. Moreover, Raman spectroscopy analysis, after mechanical treatment, in the range between 700-1800 cm(-1), indicated a relative concentration variation of MHC class I. PCA analysis was also performed to distinguish control and stressed cells within different cell lines. These mechanical induced phenotypic changes increase the tumor immunogenicity, as revealed by the related increased susceptibility to Natural Killer (NK) cells cytotoxic recognition."
https://openalex.org/W1987480282,"The genus Adelphocoris (Hemiptera: Miridae) is a group of important insect pests of Bt cotton in China. The three dominant species are A. lineolatus, A. suturalis, and A. fasciaticollis, and these species have different population dynamics. The causal factors for the differences in population dynamics have not been determined; one hypothesis is that humidity may be important for the growth of Adelphocoris populations. In the laboratory, the demographic parameters of the three Adelphocoris species were compared when the mirid bugs were subjected to various levels of relative humidity (40, 50, 60, 70 and 80% RH). Middle to high levels of RH (60, 70 and 80%) were associated with higher egg and nymph survival rates and increased adult longevity and female fecundity. Lower humidity levels (40 and 50% RH) had negative effects on the survival of nymphs, adult longevity and fecundity. The intrinsic rate of increase (rm), the net reproductive rate (R0) and the finite rate of increase (λ) for each Adelphocoris species increased with increasing RH. Significant positive relationships were found between RH and the life table parameters, rm, R0 and λ for the three Adelphocoris species. These results will help to better understand the phenology of the three Adelphocoris species, and the information can be used in population growth models to optimize pest forecasting and management strategies for these key pests."

Both gender and social anxiety have been associated with alcohol-related consequences broadly, but it is unknown whether these variables are differentially related to specific types of alcohol-related consequences for American college students. Methods In the present study, 573 undergraduate students (Mage = 19.86 years, SD = 1.40; range 18 to 25; 68.9% female) completed an on-line assessment of social anxiety, alcohol use, and four types of alcohol-related consequences (personal, social, physical, and role). Poisson regressions were run to examine social anxiety, gender, and the interaction between social anxiety and gender as predictors of each type of alcohol-related consequences. Results After controlling for alcohol use, social anxiety was positively associated with all four types of consequences, and females endorsed higher rates of physical, personal, and role consequences. The interaction between social anxiety and gender was statistically significant only for physical consequences, with social anxiety having a stronger effect for males. Discussion and Conclusions These findings, which diverge somewhat from those of a prior study with Australian college students, are discussed in the context of a biopsychosocial model of social anxiety and substance use problems. Scientific Significance This study highlights the importance of further investigating cultural differences in the relationships among social anxiety, gender, and alcohol-related consequences."
https://openalex.org/W2059802289,"Despite the recent advances on fine taxonomic discrimination in microorganisms, namely using molecular biology tools, some groups remain particularly problematic. Fine taxonomy of green algae, a widely distributed group in freshwater ecosystems, remains a challenge, especially for coccoid forms. In this paper, we propose the use of the Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy as part of a polyphasic approach to identify and classify coccoid green microalgae (mainly order Sphaeropleales), using triplicated axenic cultures. The attenuated total reflectance (ATR) technique was tested to reproducibility of IR spectra of the biological material, a primary requirement to achieve good discrimination of microalgal strains. Spectral window selection was also tested, in conjunction with the first derivative treatment of spectra, to determine which regions of the spectrum provided better separation and clustering of strains. The non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS), analysis of similarities (ANOSIM) and hierarchical clusters (HCA), demonstrated a correct discrimination and classification of closely related strains of chlorophycean coccoid microalgae, with respect to currently accepted classifications. FTIR-ATR was highly reproducible, and provided an excellent discrimination at the strain level. The best separation was achieved by analyzing the spectral windows of 1500–1200 cm−1 and 900–675 cm−1, which differs from those used in previously studies for the discrimination of broad algal groups, and excluding spectral regions related to storage compounds, which were found to give poor discrimination. Furthermore, hierarchical cluster analyses have positioned the strains tested into clades correctly, reproducing their taxonomic orders and families. This study demonstrates that FTIR-ATR has great potential to complement classical approaches for fine taxonomy of coccoid green microalgae, though a careful spectrum region selection is needed."

Method A prospective case-control study was conducted to evaluate the genetic effects of VEGF polymorphisms on the development of OSA. 150 patients and 225 healthy controls were recruited for this study and their genotypes were determined by polymerase chain reaction and restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP). The odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated by logistic regression analysis. Result Our study showed that the -460C allele (C vs. T: OR = 1.95, 95% CI = 1.38–2.76) and +936T allele (T vs. C: OR = 1.48, 95% CI = 1.02–2.15) were associated with an increased OSA risk, whereas +405C allele was associated with a decreased susceptibility to OSA (C vs. G: OR = 0.61, 95% CI = 0.45–0.83). Compared with the most common haplotype CCT, CGC (OR = 2.22, 95% CI = 1.19–4.13) and TGC (OR = 3.83, 95% CI = 1.56–9.40) were associated with a significantly increased risk of OSA. Conclusion These observations implied that VEGF gene polymorphisms might be associated with the susceptibility to OSA.

Here we report our experience with an ENU mutagenesis experiment and the rapid identification of a mutation in a previously known gene. A combination of mapping the mutation with a high-density SNP panel and a candidate gene approach has identified a mutation in collagen type II, alpha I (Col2a1).

https://openalex.org/W2028080960,"Intra-population heterogeneity is commonly observed in natural and cellular populations and has profound influence on their evolution. For example, intra-tumor heterogeneity is prevalent in most tumor types and can result in the failure of tumor therapy. However, the evolutionary process of heterogeneity remains poorly characterized at both genotypic and phenotypic level. Here we study the evolution of intra-population heterogeneities of gene regulatory networks (GRN), in particular mutational robustness and gene expression noise as contributors to the development of heterogeneities. By in silico simulations, it was found that the impact of these factors on GRN can, under certain conditions, promote phenotypic heterogeneity. We also studied the effect of population bottlenecks on the evolution of GRN. When the GRN population passes through such bottlenecks, neither mutational robustness nor population fitness was observed to be substantially altered. Interestingly, however, we did detect a significant increase in the number of potential “generator” genes which can substantially induce population fitness, when stimulated by mutational hits."
