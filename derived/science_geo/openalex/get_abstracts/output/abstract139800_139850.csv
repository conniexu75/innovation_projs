Mutations in the three known genes of the KCNQ branch of the K+ channel gene family underlie inherited cardiac arrhythmias (in some cases associated with deafness) and neonatal epilepsy. We have now cloned KCNQ4, a novel member of this branch. It maps to the DFNA2 locus for a form of nonsyndromic dominant deafness. In the cochlea, it is expressed in sensory outer hair cells. A mutation in this gene in a DFNA2 pedigree changes a residue in the KCNQ4 pore region. It abolishes the potassium currents of wild-type KCNQ4 on which it exerts a strong dominant-negative effect. Whereas mutations in KCNQ1 cause deafness by affecting endolymph secretion, the mechanism leading to KCNQ4-related hearing loss is intrinsic to outer hair cells."
https://openalex.org/W2138148973,"The U1, U2, U4/U6, and U5 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particles (snRNPs) involved in pre-mRNA splicing contain seven Sm proteins (B/B', D1, D2, D3, E, F, and G) in common, which assemble around the Sm site present in four of the major spliceosomal small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs). These proteins share a common sequence motif in two segments, Sm1 and Sm2, separated by a short variable linker. Crystal structures of two Sm protein complexes, D3B and D1D2, show that these proteins have a common fold containing an N-terminal helix followed by a strongly bent five-stranded antiparallel beta sheet, and the D1D2 and D3B dimers superpose closely in their core regions, including the dimer interfaces. The crystal structures suggest that the seven Sm proteins could form a closed ring and the snRNAs may be bound in the positively charged central hole."
https://openalex.org/W2021384992,"Activation of the type I TGFbeta receptor (TbetaR-I) requires phosphorylation of a regulatory segment known as the GS region, located upstream of the serine/threonine kinase domain in the cytoplasmic portion of the receptor. The crystal structure of a fragment of unphosphorylated TbetaR-I, containing both the GS region and the catalytic domain, has been determined in complex with the FK506-binding protein FKBP12. TbetaR-I adopts an inactive conformation that is maintained by the unphosphorylated GS region. FKBP12 binds to the GS region of the receptor, capping the TbetaR-II phosphorylation sites and further stabilizing the inactive conformation of TbetaR-I. Certain structural features at the catalytic center of TbetaR-I are characteristic of tyrosine kinases rather than Ser/Thr kinases."
https://openalex.org/W2148487263,"Histone acetyltransferases (HAT) play a critical role in transcriptional control by relieving repressive effects of chromatin, and yet how HATs themselves are regulated remains largely unknown. Here, it is shown that Twist directly binds two independent HAT domains of acetyltransferases, p300 and p300/CBP–associated factor (PCAF), and directly regulates their HAT activities. The N terminus of Twist is a primary domain interacting with both acetyltransferases, and the same domain is required for inhibition of p300-dependent transcription by Twist. Adenovirus E1A protein mimics the effects of Twist by inhibiting the HAT activities of p300 and PCAF. These findings establish a cogent argument for considering the HAT domains as a direct target for acetyltransferase regulation by both a cellular transcription factor and a viral oncoprotein."
https://openalex.org/W2021787959,"Nucleosomal histone modification is believed to be a critical step in the activation of RNA polymerase II-dependent transcription. p300/CBP and PCAF histone acetyltransferases (HATs) are coactivators for several transcription factors, including nuclear hormone receptors, p53, and Stat1alpha, and participate in transcription by forming an activation complex and by promoting histone acetylation. The adenoviral E1A oncoprotein represses transcriptional signaling by binding to p300/CBP and displacing PCAF and p/CIP proteins from the complex. Here, we show that E1A directly represses the HAT activity of both p300/CBP and PCAF in vitro and p300-dependent transcription in vivo. Additionally, E1A inhibits nucleosomal histone modifications by the PCAF complex and blocks p53 acetylation. These results demonstrate the modulation of HAT activity as a novel mechanism of transcriptional regulation."
https://openalex.org/W2147793191,"RSC, an abundant, essential chromatin-remodeling complex related to SWI/SNF complex, catalyzes the transfer of a histone octamer from a nucleosome core particle to naked DNA. The newly formed octamer–DNA complex is identical with a nucleosome in all respects. The reaction requires ATP and involves an activated RSC–nucleosome intermediate. The mechanism may entail formation of a duplex displacement loop on the nucleosome, facilitating the entry of exogeneous DNA and the release of the endogenous molecule."
https://openalex.org/W2084825928,"Mitotic double-strand break (DSB)-induced gene conversion at MAT in Saccharomyces cerevisiae was analyzed molecularly in mutant strains thermosensitive for essential replication factors. The processivity cofactors PCNA and RFC are essential even to synthesize as little as 30 nucleotides following strand invasion. Both PCNA-associated DNA polymerases delta and epsilon are important for gene conversion, though a temperature-sensitive Pol epsilon mutant is more severe than one in Pol delta. Surprisingly, mutants of lagging strand replication, DNA polymerase alpha (pol1-17), DNA primase (pri2-1), and Rad27p (rad27 delta) also greatly inhibit completion of DSB repair, even in G1-arrested cells. We propose a novel model for DSB-induced gene conversion in which a strand invasion creates a modified replication fork, involving leading and lagging strand synthesis from the donor template. Replication is terminated by capture of the second end of the DSB."

ASGP2, a transmembrane glycoprotein found on the surface of the highly metastatic ascites 13762 rat mammary adenocarcinoma cell line, is constitutively associated with ErbB2 in these cells and in mammary tissue from pregnant rats. Expression studies indicate that ASGP2 interacts directly and specifically with ErbB2 through one of its epidermal growth factor-like domains and that the co-expression of the two proteins in the same cell dramatically facilitates their direct stable interaction. Ectopic expression of ASGP2 in human melanoma tumor cells potentiates the response of endogenous ErbB2 to the neuregulin-1 growth factor.

Its overexpression in numerous human tumors, including breast and ovarian tumors, correlates with earlier patient relapse and poor prognosis (5Slamon D.J. Clark G.M. Wong S.G. Levin W.J. Ullrich A.

King C.R. Pierce J.H. Segatto O. Aaronson S.A. Di F.P. New Biol. 1990; 2: 992-1003PubMed Google Scholar), together with the observation that activated alleles of the erbB2 gene induce metastatic tumors when expressed in murine mammary epithelium (8Muller W.J.

Cell. 1988; 54: 105-115Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (928) Google Scholar), suggest that the activation of ErbB2 kinase activity may play an important role in tumorigenesis or tumor progression.The protein-tyrosine kinase activity of ErbB2 may be activated by several soluble, diffusible ligands that possess epidermal growth factor (EGF)1-like domains. For example, EGF, transforming growth factor-α, and amphiregulin are all capable of stimulating ErbB2 activity by binding to the related EGF receptor and promoting its heterodimerization with ErbB2 (9Stern D.F. Kamps M.P. Cao H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 3969-3973Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 10Riese D.J. Kim E.D. Elenius K. Buckley S. Klagsbrun M. Plowman G.D. Stern D.F. J. Biol.

Likewise, the neuregulins (NRGs) bind to the ErbB3 and ErbB4 receptors and stimulate ErbB2 activity through receptor heterodimerization mechanisms (11Carraway III, K.L. Cantley L.C. Cell. 1994; 78: 5-8Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar, 12Alroy I. Yarden Y. FEBS Lett. 1997; 410: 83-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar). However, no molecularly characterized diffusible ligand has been demonstrated to act on ErbB2 directly, and it has been suggested that the primary function of this protein is to augment signaling through the ErbB receptor network by acting as an auxiliary co-receptor (13Graus-Porta D. Beerli R.R. Hynes N.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1182-1191Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Karunagaran D. Tzahar E. Beerli R.R. Chen X. Graus-Porta D. Ratzkin B.J. Seger R. Hynes N.E. Yarden Y.

In this context factors that influence the activity or availability of ErbB2 could have a significant impact on the strength or specificity of signaling and ultimately the cellular response. Strong candidates for such factors are cell surface proteins that possess EGF-like domains.The autonomously proliferating and highly metastatic rat ascites 13762 mammary adenocarcinoma cell line expresses a large sialomucin complex in abundance at its cell surface. This complex consists of two noncovalently associated proteins, ASGP1 and ASGP2, which arise from the proteolytic processing (16Sheng Z.Q. Hull S.R. Carraway K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 8505-8510Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) of the product of a single gene (17Sheng Z. Wu K. Carraway K.L. Fregien N. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16341-16346Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). ASGP1, a ∼600-kDa heavily O-glycosylated sialomucin, is an anti-adhesive factor as well as a contributor to the ability of these cells to evade immune recognition (18Komatsu M. Carraway C.A. Fregien N.L. Carraway K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 33245-33254Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 19Moriarty J. Skelly C.M. Bharathan S. Moody C.E. Sherblom A.P. Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 6800-6805PubMed Google Scholar). The 120-kDa transmembrane subunit ASGP2 tethers the complex to the cell surface. The sequence of ASGP2 includes two EGF-like domains, one of which conserves all of the consensus residues of the active EGF-like growth factors (17Sheng Z. Wu K. Carraway K.L. Fregien N. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16341-16346Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 13762 ascites cells also express, at their surfaces, modest levels of ErbB2. The receptor and several of its associated intracellular signaling proteins are constitutively tyrosine-phosphorylated in the ascites cells, suggesting that ErbB2 is constitutively activated (20Juang S.H. Carvajal M.E. Whitney M. Liu Y. Carraway C.A. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 1033-1042PubMed Google Scholar). Here we test the hypothesis that ASGP2 influences ErbB2 activity through direct interaction with the receptor.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONTo test the whether ASGP2 might act as a modulator of ErbB2 function, the association of the two proteins in 13762 cells was first examined by co-immunoprecipitation. Detergent solubilized plasma membranes were immunoprecipitated with either anti-ASGP2 or anti-ErbB2 under conditions known to efficiently precipitate their targets, and precipitates were immunoblotted with antibodies to the other. ASGP2 was observed in anti-ErbB2 immunoprecipitates, and ErbB2 was observed in anti-ASGP2 precipitates (Fig.1 A). Since the immunoprecipitations were performed using fractions isolated from microvillar plasma membranes (21Carraway K.L. Huggins J.W. Cerra R.F. Yeltman D.R. Carraway C.A.C. Nature. 1980; 285: 508-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), these findings indicate that ASGP2 and ErbB2 are present in a complex on the surface of 13762 cells. We have observed previously that during pregnancy the expression of ASGP2 in the mammary epithelium of rats increases dramatically, and a fraction of the expressed sialomucin complex is secreted into milk (24Rossi E.A. McNeer R.R. Price-Schiavi S.A. Van den Brande J.M. Komatsu M. Thompson J.F. Carraway C.A.C. Fregien N.L. Carraway K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33476-33485Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). As with the 13762 cells, ASGP2 and ErbB2 could also be co-immunoprecipitated from lysates of homogenized mammary tissue from animals 17 days pregnant (Fig. 1 B; Ref. 24Rossi E.A. McNeer R.R. Price-Schiavi S.A. Van den Brande J.M. Komatsu M. Thompson J.F. Carraway C.A.C. Fregien N.L. Carraway K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33476-33485Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), suggesting that their association is a normal physiological event and not a result of the aberrant overexpression of ASGP2 in the tumor cells.Although the observations above indicate that ASGP2 and ErbB2 are constitutively associated at the surface of 13762 cells, the participation of another receptor or other proteins in the interaction could not be ruled out. To test the specificity of the ASGP2·ErbB2 interaction a baculovirus/insect cell expression system was developed. Insect cells were employed because they do not express endogenous ErbB receptors, eliminating confusion arising from potential receptor heterodimerization events. In the first series of experiments Sf9 insect cells were infected with baculovirus encoding ASGP2 alone or co-infected with ASGP2 and each of the known ErbB receptors. The co-immunoprecipitation assay was used to assess association. It was observed that ASGP2 could be co-immunoprecipitated with ErbB2 from cells expressing both proteins, but could not be co-precipitated with the EGF receptor, ErbB3 or ErbB4 proteins (Fig.2 A). Likewise, ASGP2 could be co-immunoprecipitated with ErbB2 when the two proteins were transiently co-expressed in COS cells, but could not be co-precipitated with the endogenous COS cell EGF receptor (data not shown). These observations indicate that the stable association of ASGP2 with ErbB receptors is selective for ErbB2 and does not require another ErbB receptor. Deletion analysis indicated that, as expected, the extracellular domain of ErbB2 is necessary for its interaction with membrane-bound ASGP2. When co-expressed in SF9 cells, ASGP2 could be co-immunoprecipitated with either full-length ErbB2 or the extracellular domain of the receptor, but could not be co-precipitated with the intracellular domain or a transmembrane form lacking most of the extracellular domain (Fig. 2 B).Figure 2Specific association of ASGP2 with ErbB2 extracellular domain. A, Sf9 insect cells were infected with viruses encoding ASGP2 and co-infected with each of the known ErbB receptors, as indicated. Cell lysates (left panel) were immunoprecipitated with appropriate anti-receptor antibodies (right panel), and samples were blotted with anti-ASGP2. In lanes marked “None” cells were infected only with virus encoding ASGP2, and lysate was immunoprecipitated with a mixture of the four anti-receptor antibodies. Normalized levels of receptors present in precipitates as determined by Ponceau S staining of the filter were: EGFR, 1.0; ErbB2, 2.3; ErbB3, 0.89; ErbB4, 1.57.B, cells were co-infected with baculovirus encoding ASGP2 and the illustrated ErbB2 constructs, and the co-immunoprecipitation assay was used to assess association. Lysates immunoprecipitated with appropriate anti-ErbB2 antibodies were blotted with anti-ASGP2 (upper panel), and anti-ErbB2 Ab-3 (lower panel), which recognizes a site at the carboxyl terminus of the protein. Theright two lanes represent control immunopreciptations with the two anti-ErbB2 antibodies employed in the experiment. Normalized levels of ErbB2 constructs present in ASGP2 co-precipitates as determined by Ponceau S staining of the filter were: ErbB2, 1.0; ErbB2 ECD, 0.85; NTK, 2.3; MS-N, 3.5.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)The extracellular domains of the ErbB2 and ASGP2 proteins could also be secreted as a complex when co-expressed in the same cell. In the experiment shown in Fig. 3 A, High Five insect cells (cells specifically adapted for the expression of secreted proteins) were infected with baculovirus encoding the extracellular domain of ASGP2 (ASGP2 ECD) or the extracellular domain of ErbB2 (ErbB2 ECD) or were co-infected with both viruses. The co-immunoprecipitation assay was then carried out with the cleared conditioned media from infected cells using anti-ErbB2 antibodies. ASGP2 ECD was detected in immunoprecipitates from cells expressing both proteins, indicating that the cells secrete ASGP2 ECD and ErbB2 ECD as a complex. Similar immunoprecipitates from metabolically labeled cells showed no other detectable radiolabeled bands, 2E. A. Rossi and K. L. Carraway, unpublished observations. suggesting that the ASGP2·ErbB2 association occurs through a direct protein-protein interaction. Moreover, resolution of the radiolabeled immunoprecipitated proteins by nonreducing SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis demonstrated that the association of ASGP2 and ErbB2 is noncovalent in the secreted complex from the High Five cells. Finally, sedimentation analysis of the secreted complex suggested that ASGP2 is capable of associating in a 1:1 complex with monomeric ErbB2 ECD.2Figure 3Association of ASGP2 and ErbB2 extracellular domains. A, High Five insect cells were infected with virus encoding the extracellular domain of ErbB2 (ErbB2 ECD,lanes A), virus encoding the extracellular domain of ASGP2 (ASGP2 ECD, lanes B), or co-infected with the two viruses (lanes C). Equal volumes of the conditioned media for the ErbB2 ECD and ASGP2 ECD individual infections were also mixed (lanes D). Conditioned media and immunoprecipitates using anti-ErbB2 or anti-ASGP2 were blotted with anti-ASGP2 after SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Normalized levels of ErbB2 ECD present in ErbB2 immunoprecipitates as determined by Ponceau S staining of the filter were: lane A, 1.0; lane B, 0;lane C, 1.1; lane D, 0.63. B, High Five cells were co-infected with baculovirus encoding ErbB2 ECD and the illustrated ASGP2 constructs (upper panel), and association was measured by co-immunoprecipitation (lower panel,left) from the conditioned medium (lower panel,right) and immunoblotting with anti-ASGP2. Ponceau S staining of the filter revealed similar levels of ErbB2 ECD in each lane (not shown).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)To determine the domain within ASGP2 that mediates its interaction with ErbB2, deletion mutagenesis from the carboxyl terminus of the ligand was performed. ASGP2 deletion mutants were co-expressed with ErbB2 ECD in High Five cells, and the co-immunoprecipitation assay was employed to determine the extent of interaction between the expressed secreted proteins (Fig. 3 B). ASGP2 forms containing EGF1, the EGF-like domain that possesses the consensus residues found in active growth factors (17Sheng Z. Wu K. Carraway K.L. Fregien N. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16341-16346Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), could be co-immunoprecipitated with ErbB2 ECD. However, when the EGF1 domain was deleted, the ability of ASGP2 to associate with ErbB2 was almost completely abolished. These results indicate that the EGF1 domain of ASGP2 is necessary for its stable interaction with the ErbB2 receptor.Fig. 3 A demonstrates that the co-expression of the ASGP2 and ErbB2 proteins is necessary for their interaction. When the conditioned media from insect cells independently expressing ASGP2 ECD and ErbB2 ECD were mixed, no co-immunoprecipitation of ASGP2 and ErbB2 was observed. This is consistent with our observations that ASGP2 ECD expressed in either insect cells or COS monkey cells will neither bind to nor activate ErbB2 when added exogenously to cultured mammalian cells that express this receptor. 3K. L. Carraway III, E. A. Rossi, K. Masanobu, and K. L. Carraway, unpublished observations. The reason for the requirement of co-expression for ASGP2·ErbB2 complex formation is presently unclear. The simplest explanation is that high concentrations of ASGP2 and ErbB2 are necessary for complex formation, a condition that is met in membranes and in cellular compartments, but not by the addition of soluble ligand to cells. Once formed, the complex is very stable and resistant to dissociation during the immunoprecipitation procedures.The results above indicate that ASGP2 binds directly to the ErbB2 receptor when the two proteins are co-expressed in the same cell. To examine the functional outcome of the interaction, sialomucin complex was expressed in an inducible manner in A375 human melanoma cells (18Komatsu M. Carraway C.A. Fregien N.L. Carraway K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 33245-33254Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). These cells express modest levels of ErbB2 and ErbB3 and respond biochemically to the neuregulin-1 (NRG1β) growth factor ligand. When ASGP2 expression was turned on with the removal of tetracycline from the growth medium, it was observed that the NRG1β-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of the ErbB2 and ErbB3 receptors was increased substantially (Fig. 4 A). Blotting with anti-ErbB2 and anti-ErbB3 antibodies indicated that this increase could not be accounted for by an increase in overall receptor expression. The potentiating effect of ASGP2 on ErbB signaling was reflected in the growth response of these cells to NRG1β but not serum (Table I). These observations suggest that the functional outcome of the interaction of ASGP2 with ErbB2 is to potentiate ErbB2 kinase activation and signaling in response to EGF-like ligands. Interestingly, ASGP2 did not potentiate the tyrosine phosphorylation of Shc or the activation of the MAP kinases ERK1 or ERK2 in response to NRG1β (data not shown), perhaps suggesting that its role in ErbB signaling is to trigger otherwise unused pathways by inducing the phosphorylation of additional tyrosine residues.Figure 4Effect of ASGP2 expression on ErbB2 activity. A375 human melanoma cell transfectants were treated with and without tetracycline to induce sialomucin complex expression and then treated without and with recombinant NRG1, as indicated. Lysates and anti-ErbB2 and anti-ErbB3 immunoprecipitates were first blotted with anti-phosphotyrosine (upper panel). The filter was then cut apart and lysate lanes (lower left panel), anti-ErbB2 lanes (lower middle panel), and anti-ErbB3 lanes (lower right panel) were re-probed with anti-ASGP2, anti-ErbB2, and anti-ErbB3, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Table IPotentiation of neuregulin-stimulated [3H]thymidine uptake by ASGP2StimulusTetracyclineCounts/min incorporatedNone+2266 ± 193None−2722 ± 22510 nmNRG+2671 ± 6710 nm NRG−4919 ± 52010% calf serum+17,675 ± 128210% calf serum−17,689 ± 1936Serum-starved transfected A375 cells were treated with and without tetracycline for 48 h to regulate ASGP2 expression.

Open table in a new tab We conclude that when co-expressed in the same cell, ASGP2 interacts directly with ErbB2 extracellular domain through its EGF1 domain and potentiates signaling through the ErbB receptor network. Interestingly, ASGP2 affects the extent of NRG1-stimulated receptor tyrosine phosphorylation rather than the dose-response curve of activation, 4K. L. Carraway III, unpublished observations. implying that its role is not in the facilitation of ErbB2·ErbB3 heterodimeric complexes. Our results instead suggest that ASGP2 increases either the number of ErbB2 molecules available for activation or the extent of activation of each ErbB2 receptor.

In this context factors that influence the activity or availability of ErbB2 could have a significant impact on the strength or specificity of signaling and ultimately the cellular response. Strong candidates for such factors are cell surface proteins that possess EGF-like domains. The autonomously proliferating and highly metastatic rat ascites 13762 mammary adenocarcinoma cell line expresses a large sialomucin complex in abundance at its cell surface. This complex consists of two noncovalently associated proteins, ASGP1 and ASGP2, which arise from the proteolytic processing (16Sheng Z.Q. Hull S.R. Carraway K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 8505-8510Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) of the product of a single gene (17Sheng Z. Wu K. Carraway K.L. Fregien N. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16341-16346Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). ASGP1, a ∼600-kDa heavily O-glycosylated sialomucin, is an anti-adhesive factor as well as a contributor to the ability of these cells to evade immune recognition (18Komatsu M. Carraway C.A. Fregien N.L. Carraway K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 33245-33254Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 19Moriarty J. Skelly C.M. Bharathan S. Moody C.E. Sherblom A.P. Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 6800-6805PubMed Google Scholar). The 120-kDa transmembrane subunit ASGP2 tethers the complex to the cell surface. The sequence of ASGP2 includes two EGF-like domains, one of which conserves all of the consensus residues of the active EGF-like growth factors (17Sheng Z. Wu K. Carraway K.L. Fregien N. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16341-16346Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 13762 ascites cells also express, at their surfaces, modest levels of ErbB2. The receptor and several of its associated intracellular signaling proteins are constitutively tyrosine-phosphorylated in the ascites cells, suggesting that ErbB2 is constitutively activated (20Juang S.H. Carvajal M.E. Whitney M. Liu Y. Carraway C.A. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 1033-1042PubMed Google Scholar). Here we test the hypothesis that ASGP2 influences ErbB2 activity through direct interaction with the receptor. RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONTo test the whether ASGP2 might act as a modulator of ErbB2 function, the association of the two proteins in 13762 cells was first examined by co-immunoprecipitation. Detergent solubilized plasma membranes were immunoprecipitated with either anti-ASGP2 or anti-ErbB2 under conditions known to efficiently precipitate their targets, and precipitates were immunoblotted with antibodies to the other. ASGP2 was observed in anti-ErbB2 immunoprecipitates, and ErbB2 was observed in anti-ASGP2 precipitates (Fig.1 A). Since the immunoprecipitations were performed using fractions isolated from microvillar plasma membranes (21Carraway K.L. Huggins J.W. Cerra R.F. Yeltman D.R. Carraway C.A.C. Nature. 1980; 285: 508-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), these findings indicate that ASGP2 and ErbB2 are present in a complex on the surface of 13762 cells. We have observed previously that during pregnancy the expression of ASGP2 in the mammary epithelium of rats increases dramatically, and a fraction of the expressed sialomucin complex is secreted into milk (24Rossi E.A. McNeer R.R. Price-Schiavi S.A. Van den Brande J.M. Komatsu M. Thompson J.F. Carraway C.A.C. Fregien N.L. Carraway K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33476-33485Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). As with the 13762 cells, ASGP2 and ErbB2 could also be co-immunoprecipitated from lysates of homogenized mammary tissue from animals 17 days pregnant (Fig. 1 B; Ref. 24Rossi E.A. McNeer R.R. Price-Schiavi S.A. Van den Brande J.M. Komatsu M. Thompson J.F. Carraway C.A.C. Fregien N.L. Carraway K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33476-33485Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), suggesting that their association is a normal physiological event and not a result of the aberrant overexpression of ASGP2 in the tumor cells.Although the observations above indicate that ASGP2 and ErbB2 are constitutively associated at the surface of 13762 cells, the participation of another receptor or other proteins in the interaction could not be ruled out. To test the specificity of the ASGP2·ErbB2 interaction a baculovirus/insect cell expression system was developed. Insect cells were employed because they do not express endogenous ErbB receptors, eliminating confusion arising from potential receptor heterodimerization events. In the first series of experiments Sf9 insect cells were infected with baculovirus encoding ASGP2 alone or co-infected with ASGP2 and each of the known ErbB receptors. The co-immunoprecipitation assay was used to assess association. It was observed that ASGP2 could be co-immunoprecipitated with ErbB2 from cells expressing both proteins, but could not be co-precipitated with the EGF receptor, ErbB3 or ErbB4 proteins (Fig.2 A). Likewise, ASGP2 could be co-immunoprecipitated with ErbB2 when the two proteins were transiently co-expressed in COS cells, but could not be co-precipitated with the endogenous COS cell EGF receptor (data not shown). These observations indicate that the stable association of ASGP2 with ErbB receptors is selective for ErbB2 and does not require another ErbB receptor. Deletion analysis indicated that, as expected, the extracellular domain of ErbB2 is necessary for its interaction with membrane-bound ASGP2. When co-expressed in SF9 cells, ASGP2 could be co-immunoprecipitated with either full-length ErbB2 or the extracellular domain of the receptor, but could not be co-precipitated with the intracellular domain or a transmembrane form lacking most of the extracellular domain (Fig. 2 B).The extracellular domains of the ErbB2 and ASGP2 proteins could also be secreted as a complex when co-expressed in the same cell. In the experiment shown in Fig. 3 A, High Five insect cells (cells specifically adapted for the expression of secreted proteins) were infected with baculovirus encoding the extracellular domain of ASGP2 (ASGP2 ECD) or the extracellular domain of ErbB2 (ErbB2 ECD) or were co-infected with both viruses. The co-immunoprecipitation assay was then carried out with the cleared conditioned media from infected cells using anti-ErbB2 antibodies. ASGP2 ECD was detected in immunoprecipitates from cells expressing both proteins, indicating that the cells secrete ASGP2 ECD and ErbB2 ECD as a complex. Similar immunoprecipitates from metabolically labeled cells showed no other detectable radiolabeled bands, 2E. A. Rossi and K. L. Carraway, unpublished observations. suggesting that the ASGP2·ErbB2 association occurs through a direct protein-protein interaction. Moreover, resolution of the radiolabeled immunoprecipitated proteins by nonreducing SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis demonstrated that the association of ASGP2 and ErbB2 is noncovalent in the secreted complex from the High Five cells. Finally, sedimentation analysis of the secreted complex suggested that ASGP2 is capable of associating in a 1:1 complex with monomeric ErbB2 ECD.2Figure 3Association of ASGP2 and ErbB2 extracellular domains. A, High Five insect cells were infected with virus encoding the extracellular domain of ErbB2 (ErbB2 ECD,lanes A), virus encoding the extracellular domain of ASGP2 (ASGP2 ECD, lanes B), or co-infected with the two viruses (lanes C). Equal volumes of the conditioned media for the ErbB2 ECD and ASGP2 ECD individual infections were also mixed (lanes D). Conditioned media and immunoprecipitates using anti-ErbB2 or anti-ASGP2 were blotted with anti-ASGP2 after SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Normalized levels of ErbB2 ECD present in ErbB2 immunoprecipitates as determined by Ponceau S staining of the filter were: lane A, 1.0; lane B, 0;lane C, 1.1; lane D, 0.63. B, High Five cells were co-infected with baculovirus encoding ErbB2 ECD and the illustrated ASGP2 constructs (upper panel), and association was measured by co-immunoprecipitation (lower panel,left) from the conditioned medium (lower panel,right) and immunoblotting with anti-ASGP2. Ponceau S staining of the filter revealed similar levels of ErbB2 ECD in each lane (not shown).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)To determine the domain within ASGP2 that mediates its interaction with ErbB2, deletion mutagenesis from the carboxyl terminus of the ligand was performed. ASGP2 deletion mutants were co-expressed with ErbB2 ECD in High Five cells, and the co-immunoprecipitation assay was employed to determine the extent of interaction between the expressed secreted proteins (Fig. 3 B). ASGP2 forms containing EGF1, the EGF-like domain that possesses the consensus residues found in active growth factors (17Sheng Z. Wu K. Carraway K.L. Fregien N. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16341-16346Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), could be co-immunoprecipitated with ErbB2 ECD. However, when the EGF1 domain was deleted, the ability of ASGP2 to associate with ErbB2 was almost completely abolished. These results indicate that the EGF1 domain of ASGP2 is necessary for its stable interaction with the ErbB2 receptor.Fig. 3 A demonstrates that the co-expression of the ASGP2 and ErbB2 proteins is necessary for their interaction. When the conditioned media from insect cells independently expressing ASGP2 ECD and ErbB2 ECD were mixed, no co-immunoprecipitation of ASGP2 and ErbB2 was observed. This is consistent with our observations that ASGP2 ECD expressed in either insect cells or COS monkey cells will neither bind to nor activate ErbB2 when added exogenously to cultured mammalian cells that express this receptor. 3K. L. Carraway III, E. A. Rossi, K. Masanobu, and K. L. Carraway, unpublished observations. The reason for the requirement of co-expression for ASGP2·ErbB2 complex formation is presently unclear. The simplest explanation is that high concentrations of ASGP2 and ErbB2 are necessary for complex formation, a condition that is met in membranes and in cellular compartments, but not by the addition of soluble ligand to cells. Once formed, the complex is very stable and resistant to dissociation during the immunoprecipitation procedures.The results above indicate that ASGP2 binds directly to the ErbB2 receptor when the two proteins are co-expressed in the same cell. To examine the functional outcome of the interaction, sialomucin complex was expressed in an inducible manner in A375 human melanoma cells (18Komatsu M. Carraway C.A. Fregien N.L. Carraway K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 33245-33254Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). These cells express modest levels of ErbB2 and ErbB3 and respond biochemically to the neuregulin-1 (NRG1β) growth factor ligand. When ASGP2 expression was turned on with the removal of tetracycline from the growth medium, it was observed that the NRG1β-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of the ErbB2 and ErbB3 receptors was increased substantially (Fig. 4 A). Blotting with anti-ErbB2 and anti-ErbB3 antibodies indicated that this increase could not be accounted for by an increase in overall receptor expression. The potentiating effect of ASGP2 on ErbB signaling was reflected in the growth response of these cells to NRG1β but not serum (Table I). These observations suggest that the functional outcome of the interaction of ASGP2 with ErbB2 is to potentiate ErbB2 kinase activation and signaling in response to EGF-like ligands. Interestingly, ASGP2 did not potentiate the tyrosine phosphorylation of Shc or the activation of the MAP kinases ERK1 or ERK2 in response to NRG1β (data not shown), perhaps suggesting that its role in ErbB signaling is to trigger otherwise unused pathways by inducing the phosphorylation of additional tyrosine residues.Figure 4Effect of ASGP2 expression on ErbB2 activity. A375 human melanoma cell transfectants were treated with and without tetracycline to induce sialomucin complex expression and then treated without and with recombinant NRG1, as indicated. Lysates and anti-ErbB2 and anti-ErbB3 immunoprecipitates were first blotted with anti-phosphotyrosine (upper panel). The filter was then cut apart and lysate lanes (lower left panel), anti-ErbB2 lanes (lower middle panel), and anti-ErbB3 lanes (lower right panel) were re-probed with anti-ASGP2, anti-ErbB2, and anti-ErbB3, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Table IPotentiation of neuregulin-stimulated [3H]thymidine uptake by ASGP2StimulusTetracyclineCounts/min incorporatedNone+2266 ± 193None−2722 ± 22510 nmNRG+2671 ± 6710 nm NRG−4919 ± 52010% calf serum+17,675 ± 128210% calf serum−17,689 ± 1936Serum-starved transfected A375 cells were treated with and without tetracycline for 48 h to regulate ASGP2 expression.

Open table in a new tab We conclude that when co-expressed in the same cell, ASGP2 interacts directly with ErbB2 extracellular domain through its EGF1 domain and potentiates signaling through the ErbB receptor network. Interestingly, ASGP2 affects the extent of NRG1-stimulated receptor tyrosine phosphorylation rather than the dose-response curve of activation, 4K. L. Carraway III, unpublished observations. implying that its role is not in the facilitation of ErbB2·ErbB3 heterodimeric complexes. Our results instead suggest that ASGP2 increases either the number of ErbB2 molecules available for activation or the extent of activation of each ErbB2 receptor.

One of these compounds is Se-methylselenocysteine, synthesized by a number of species from the genus Astragalus (Fabaceae), like A. bisulcatus. An enzyme has been previously isolated from this organism that catalyzes methyl transfer fromS-adenosylmethionine to selenocysteine. To elucidate the role of the enzyme in selenium tolerance, the cDNA coding for selenocysteine methyltransferase from A. bisulcatus was cloned and sequenced. Data base searches revealed the existence of several apparent homologs of hitherto unassigned function. The gene for one of them, yagD from Escherichia coli, was cloned, and the protein was overproduced and purified. A functional analysis showed that the YagD protein catalyzes methylation of homocysteine, selenohomocysteine, and selenocysteine withS-adenosylmethionine and S-methylmethionine as methyl group donors. S-Methylmethionine was now shown to be also the physiological methyl group donor for the A. bisulcatus selenocysteine methyltransferase. A model system was set up in E. coli which demonstrated that expression of the plant and, although to a much lesser degree, of the bacterial methyltransferase gene increases selenium tolerance and strongly reduces unspecific selenium incorporation into proteins, provided thatS-methylmethionine is present in the medium.

As a consequence, selenium is processed along the sulfur pathways and is incorporated unspecifically into low and high molecular weight compounds normally containing sulfur. The extent of replacement of sulfur by selenium depends on the ratio of the two elements in the environment and on the differential affinities of the sulfur pathway enzymes for their cognate substrate and the selenium-containing analog (for reviews, see Refs. 1Shrift A.

There are, however, metabolic systems in which biological discrimination takes place. The first one is the specific synthesis and insertion of selenocysteine into proteins, directed by a UGA codon in the respective mRNA (4Stadtman T.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 83-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (808) Google Scholar, 5Hüttenhofer A. Böck A. Simons R.W. Grunberg-Manago M. RNA Structure and Function. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1998: 603-639Google Scholar). Biosynthesis of selenocysteine occurs in a tRNA-bound state and, therefore, separate from sulfur metabolism. The crucial step in the discrimination between sulfur and selenium seems to reside in the synthesis of the selenium donor molecule monoselenophosphate by the enzyme selenophosphate synthetase (for a review, see Ref. 4Stadtman T.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 83-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (808) Google Scholar). Monoselenophosphate is also the selenium donor for the conversion of 2-thiouridine into 2-selenouridine in several tRNA species (6Wittwer A.J. Stadtman T.C. Arch. Biochem.

The second biological phenomenon, in which discrimination between selenium and sulfur occurs is selenium tolerance of plants that accumulate high amounts of organoselenium compounds (for reviews, see Refs. 1Shrift A.

Shrift A. Biol. Rev. 1982; 57: 59-84Crossref Google Scholar). A general mechanism explaining the high selenium tolerance of these plants was not apparent, however. A common feature of selenium accumulator plants is that tolerance is always paralleled by synthesis of selenium-containing compounds like Se-methylselenocysteine, γ-glutamyl-Se-methylselenocysteine, or selenocystathionine (2Brown T.A. Shrift A. Biol. Rev. 1982; 57: 59-84Crossref Google Scholar). For this reason, it was hypothesized that the basis of selenium tolerance may reside in the existence of enzymes scrutinizing the cellular pool of sulfur metabolites for selenium compounds and converting them to adducts that are non-proteinogenic (12Brown T.A. Shrift A. Plant Physiol. 1981; 67: 1051-1053Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Virupaksha T.K. Shrift A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1965; 107: 69-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 14Burnell J.N. Plant Physiol. 1981; 67: 316-324Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Indeed, a methyltransferase could be purified recently from a selenium accumulator species, Astragalus bisulcatus, which specifically methylated selenocysteine with S-adenosylmethionine as methyl donor. The activity of this selenocysteine methyltransferase (SeCys1 methyltransferase) with l-cysteine was at least 3 orders of magnitude lower than with l-selenocysteine (15Neuhierl B. Böck A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 239: 235-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). In the present communication we present the causal connection between synthesis of the SeCys-methyltransferase and selenium tolerance. The cDNA coding for this enzyme in A. bisulcatus has been cloned and shown to confer selenium tolerance when transferred toEscherichia coli, provided that the cognate methyl group donor is available. Moreover, we show that the enzyme belongs to a class of methyltransferases involved in the metabolism ofS-methylmethionine. E. coli strain JM109 (16Yanisch-Perron C. Vieira J. Messing J. Gene (Amst.). 1985; 33: 103-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (11450) Google Scholar) was used for general cloning purposes and as a source of chromosomal DNA for amplification of the yagDgene. SeCys-methyltransferase and YagD were overproduced in E. coli strain BL21(DE3) (17Studier F.W. Moffat B.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 189: 113-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (4811) Google Scholar). E. coli strain MTD1, carrying an in frame deletion in the yagD gene, was constructed from strain KL19 (18Low B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1968; 60: 160-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar) by deleting nucleotides 270–548 of the yagD open reading frame (19Blattner F.R. Plunkett III, G. Bloch C.A. Perna N.T. Burland V. Riley M. Collado-Vides J. Glasner J.D. Rode C.K. Mayhew G.F. Gregor J. Davis N.W. Kirkpatrick H.A. Goeden M.A. Rose D.J. Mau B. Shao Y. Science. 1997; 277: 1453-1474Crossref PubMed Scopus (5989) Google Scholar) according to the method of Hamilton et al. (20Hamilton C.M. Aldea M. Washburn B.K. Babitzke P. Kushner S.R. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 4617-4622Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A. bisulcatus seeds were from the Western Regional Plant Introduction Station, Pullman, WA (reference number PI 372510). Seeds were germinated according to Brown and Shrift (12Brown T.A. Shrift A. Plant Physiol. 1981; 67: 1051-1053Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and seedlings were grown at 25 °C under continuous illumination. Conditions for plant cell culture of A. bisulcatus have been described previously (15Neuhierl B. Böck A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 239: 235-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). E. coli cells were grown aerobically in LB medium (21Miller J.H. A Short Course in Bacterial Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1992Google Scholar) or in M9 minimal medium (22Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Cultures for overproduction of SeCys-methyltransferase and YagD were grown in overproduction medium composed of 3% (w/v) tryptone, 1% yeast extract, and 1% NaCl. The ability of E. coli strains to detoxify selenium in the presence of S-methylmethionine was tested in M9 minimal medium containing 0.8% glucose. The concentrations of sulfate and selenate ions were adjusted to 100 and 50 μm, respectively. 2-ml cultures with this medium were supplemented with serial 1:2 dilutions of S-methylmethionine and inoculated in a ratio of 1:20 (v/v) with cultures that had been adjusted to anA 600 of 0.02. A culture withoutS-methylmethionine supplementation was used as a control. Cells were grown aerobically at 37 °C for 24 h, after which theA 600 was determined. Growth experiments were performed in at least two independent experiments. Thein vivo incorporation of 75Se into E. coli under aerobic growth conditions was followed with the method described by Cox et al. (23Cox J.C. Edwards E.S. DeMoss J.A. J. Bacteriol. 1981; 145: 1317-1324Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), replacing L broth by M9 minimal medium containing 0.8% glucose and 50 μg/ml chloramphenicol where appropriate. [75Se]sodium selenite (specific activity, 10 mCi/mmol) was present at 0.3 μm. Cells were harvested by centrifugation after reaching an A 600 of 0.25–0.4 and lysed in SDS sample buffer by heating to 95 °C for 10 min. The supernatant of the subsequent centrifugation (10 min at 14,000 × g and room temperature) was used for SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). Gels were dried on filter paper and autoradiographed overnight on a PhosphorScreen (Molecular Dynamics, Krefeld, Germany). Standard recombinant DNA techniques were employed according to Sambrook et al. (22Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). DNA fragments were amplified by PCR using Goldstar polymerase (Eurogentech, Belgium) or Pfu polymerase (Stratagene) and primer concentrations in the range of 0.4–0.6 pmol/μl. The positive selection vector pUKE was constructed in the following way: first, a 1.3-kb fragment containing the kanamycin resistance gene was produced from pUC4 KSAC (Pharmacia, Freiburg, Germany) byPstI restriction and treatment with Klenow polymerase in the presence of all four nucleoside triphosphates. It was cloned into plasmid pUC19 (16Yanisch-Perron C. Vieira J. Messing J. Gene (Amst.). 1985; 33: 103-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (11450) Google Scholar), from which the ampicillin resistance gene had been removed by AvaII/AatII restriction and subsequent treatment with Klenow polymerase in the presence of all four nucleoside triphosphates. The resulting plasmid, containing the promoter of the kanamycin resistance gene in the opposite orientation with respect to the lac promoter, was designated pUKB. In the second step, the sequence coding for the EcoRI restriction endonuclease from plasmid pKGS (24Kuhn I. Stephenson F.H. Boyer H.W. Greene J. Gene (Amst.). 1986; 44: 253-263Crossref Scopus (35) Google Scholar) was amplified by PCR with primersEcoN (5′-TGTCTAATAAAAAACAGTC-3′, identical with nucleotides 2–20 of the EcoRI open reading frame) and EcoC (5′-TCACTTAGATGTAAGCTG-3′, complementary to nucleotides 817–834 of the open reading frame). The fragment was cloned into pUKB cleaved withEcoRI and treated with Klenow polymerase. The resulting plasmid, conferring sensitivity to the presence of 0.5 mmisopropylthiogalactoside in the medium (24Kuhn I. Stephenson F.H. Boyer H.W. Greene J. Gene (Amst.). 1986; 44: 253-263Crossref Scopus (35) Google Scholar), was named pUKE. Total RNA was extracted from 5 g of A. bisulcatus cells using hot acidic phenol as described by Aiba et al. (25Aiba H. Adhya S. de Crombrugghe B. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 11905-11910Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with the following modifications: the phenol solution originally described was replaced by a 1:1 (v/v) mixture of liquefied, unbuffered phenol and an 8m guanidinium chloride solution containing 0.3m sodium acetate. After heat treatment (20 min at 65 °C) and cooling to 4 °C, phase separation was achieved by addition of 0.5 volumes of chloroform, vigorous mixing, and centrifugation. After repeating the extraction with the aqueous phase, RNA was precipitated by addition of isopropyl alcohol to a final concentration of 50% (v/v) and sedimented by centrifugation. Poly(A)+ RNA was enriched on an oligo(dT)-cellulose matrix (Pharmacia, Freiburg, Germany), following the protocol provided by the manufacturer. Double-stranded cDNA was synthesized with the method of Gubler (26Gubler U. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 2726Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). A linker molecule produced by hybridization of the oligonucleotides Link1 (5′-AAGCTTGGTACCCGGG-3′) and 5′-phosphorylated Link2 (5′-AATTCCCGGGTACCAAGCTT-3′) was ligated to the cDNA, and molecules >400 bp were enriched using a “size sep 400” spin column (Pharmacia, Freiburg, Germany). The cDNA sequence coding for SeCys-methyltransferase fromA. bisulcatus was cloned by a PCR approach. First, SeCys-methyltransferase purified from A. bisulcatus (15Neuhierl B. Böck A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 239: 235-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) was hydrolyzed with endoprotease Endo-LysC, and peptides were purified and sequenced by Edman degradation. From these sequences degenerate oligonucleotides were derived and used as primers for PCR with cDNA from A. bisulcatus as a template. With primers 38MT34 (5′-ATIGC(AG)TC(AG)TAIGT(CT)TCICC-3′; where I indicates inosine) and 38MT66/2 (5′-GA(AG)GCICA(AG)GCITA(CT)GC-3′), a 270-bp fragment could be amplified, cloned into pUC19, and sequenced. From this sequence, two oligonucleotides with divergent orientation on the cDNA (38MT-1, 5′-CCATCCTTAGAGGTAAACGC-3′ and 38MT-2, 5′-ATCTGATACTTCTGCTTAAG-3′) were derived. They were used as primers for PCR with cDNA that had been hydrolyzed with HindIII and circularized by ligation at low concentration (<1 μg DNA/ml) as a template. From this amplification reaction, a 0.5-kb fragment could be cloned in pUKE and sequenced, which provided approximately 200 bp each of new sequence information in 5′ and 3′ direction. Using primers 38MT-2 and 38MT3 (5′-ATTATGTTCTCCTCTTCCAG-3′), PCR amplification was repeated with non-hydrolyzed, circularized cDNA as a template. A 0.75-kb fragment was cloned into pUKE and sequenced. This provided information on the 3′ end of the cDNA with a putative stop codon, although a poly(A) sequence was not found. The 5′ end of the cDNA was cloned by first amplifying circularized cDNA with oligonucleotides 38MT-1 and 38MT-2 as primers. Products >1 kb were gel-purified and used as templates for a second amplification with Link2 and 38MT11 (5′-TTGCTTCAAATGCAAGCAGG-3′). From the amplified products, a 0.6-kb DNA fragment could be cloned into pUKE and sequenced, which contained a putative ATG start codon and 57 bp of 5′-untranslated sequence. Plasmids for the overproduction of SeCys-methyltransferase and YagD protein were constructed from plasmid pT7-7 (27Tabor S. Richardson C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 262: 1074-1078Crossref Scopus (2452) Google Scholar); the open reading frames were amplified by PCR with Pfu polymerase (primers: 38MT5, 5′-TTACTAGTAGATTTGTTTGC-3′ and 38MT8, 5′-ATGTCGTCGCCATTGATAAC-3′ for SeCys-methyltransferase; EcMTN, 5′-ATGTCGCAGAATAATCCG-3′ and EcMTC, 5′-TCAGCTTCGCGCTTTTAAC-3′ for YAGD) and cDNA from A. bisulcatus or chromosomal DNA from E. coli JM109 for SeCys-methyltransferase and YagD, respectively. Amplified DNA fragments were treated with Klenow polymerase in the presence of dATP, dGTP, and dCTP. They were ligated into pT7-7 which had been cleaved withNdeI/SmaI and treated with Klenow polymerase under the same conditions as the PCR fragments. The vector containing the methyltransferase gene (smtA) from A. bisulcatus was named p7AMT and that carrying the yagDgene from E. coli was designated p7EMT. A derivative of pT7-7 containing the trxA gene from E. coli under the control of the T7 promoter was constructed as follows: the trxA gene was isolated from pSM1 (28Müller S. Senn H. Gsell B. Vetter W. Baron C. Böck A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 3404-3412Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) byEcoRI restriction, treatment with Klenow polymerase, and restriction with HindIII. pT7-7 was cleaved withSalI, DNA ends were made flush with Klenow polymerase, the plasmid was re-cleaved with HindIII, and the trxAfragment was inserted by ligation. The resulting plasmid was named pT77T. The overexpression plasmid p7AMTT, containing the sequences coding for SeCys-methyltransferase from A. bisulcatus and for thioredoxin from E. coli in an artificial operon, was prepared by transferring the sequence coding for the SeCys-methyltransferase from p7AMT into pT77T via the XbaI restriction sites of the plasmids. Vectors for constitutive production of SeCys-methyltransferase and YagD in E. coli were constructed from pACYC184 (29Chang A.C.Y. Cohen S.N. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 134: 1141-1156Crossref Google Scholar). The plasmid was cleaved with EcoRV andHincII and blunt-end XbaI fragments from plasmids p7AMT or p7EMT, containing the open reading frames for SeCys-methyltransferase or YagD, respectively, were inserted by ligation so that the corresponding genes could be expressed constitutively via the tetracycline promoter. The resulting plasmids were designated pACAMTT and pACEMTT, respectively. Sequences of proteins similar to that from SeCys-methyltransferase were obtained via internet from The Institute of Genomic Research 2Information available on-line at the following address: http://www.tigr.org. and the National Institutes of Health. 3Information available on-line at the following address: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov. Sequence alignments were produced with MegAlign (version 0.97). SDS-PAGE was performed according to Laemmli (30Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206631) Google Scholar). Crude extracts from plant tissues and cultured cells of A. bisulcatus for SDS-PAGE were obtained by mixing plant material in a 1:1 ratio (w/v) with SDS sample buffer. The mixture was frozen in liquid nitrogen, boiled for 10–15 min, and centrifuged. The supernatant was used for gel electrophoresis. For the generation of a polyclonal antiserum directed against SeCys-methyltransferase purified from A. bisulcatus, a rabbit was immunized by intradermal injection of the protein in a custom immunization program at Eurogentec (Belgium). In immunoblotting experiments (22Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar), the polyclonal anti-SeCys-methyltransferase antiserum was used in a 1:3000–1:5000 dilution employing the enhanced chemiluminescence system from Boehringer Mannheim. The YagD protein was overproduced in E. coli BL21(DE3) containing the plasmid p7EMT. Cells were grown in 8 liters of overproduction medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin in a 10-liter laboratory fermenter (Braun, Melsungen, Germany) at 37 °C and maximal aeration. At an A 600 of 1.5, overproduction was started by the addition of isopropylthiogalactoside to a final concentration of 50 μm. Incubation was continued until the mass production in the culture had ceased, thereafter cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed with C-Buffer (25 mm Tris/Cl, 10 mm magnesium acetate, 1 mm EDTA, and 2 mm dithiothreitol, pH 7.5), frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −20 °C. All steps of the purification of YagD were performed at 0–4 °C. After each step, fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie staining, and those containing the YagD protein were pooled. For the preparation of a crude extract, 20 g of cells were resuspended in 40 ml of C-buffer containing 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and lysed by three passages through a French pressure cell at 13,000 p.s.i. The soluble (S100) fraction was obtained by centrifugation (30 min at 30,000 × g, supernatant = S30, and 2 h at 100,000 × g, supernatant = S100) and adjusted to 30% ammonium sulfate saturation. The pellet of the following centrifugation was resuspended in a small volume of C-buffer and dialyzed overnight against 2 liters of C-buffer. Proteins were chromatographed on a 1.6 × 10-cm Q-Sepharose column (Pharmacia, Germany), using a gradient from 0 to 500 mm NaCl in C-buffer over 20 column volumes. YagD was precipitated overnight from 50% ammonium sulfate, sedimented by centrifugation, and dissolved in a small volume of C-buffer containing 150 mm KCl. The protein was chromatographed on a 1.6 × 60-cm Superdex 75 gel filtration column (Pharmacia, Germany). Fractions that appeared pure in an SDS gel were pooled, and the YagD protein was precipitated from 50% ammonium sulfate overnight. For long term storage, the preparation was dialyzed against 500 ml of C-buffer containing 50% glycerol and kept at −20 °C. The purification of SeCys-methyltransferase from cultured A. bisulcatus cells has been described previously (15Neuhierl B. Böck A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 239: 235-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Overproduction of SeCys-methyltransferase in E. coli was performed with strain BL21(DE3) transformed with plasmids pUBS520 (31Tanaka H. Soda K. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 143: 240-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) and p7AMTT as described for the YagD protein. Cells were lysed, and the soluble fraction was prepared as described for the YagD protein. The purification protocol for the recombinant protein was similar to the purification from cultured A. bisulcatuscells, with the following modifications: after ammonium sulfate precipitation, hydrophobic interaction chromatography on the phenyl-Sepharose column was used first, followed by gel filtration on Superdex 75. Fractions containing SeCys-methyltransferase were chromatographed on a 1.6 × 10-cm Q-Sepharose column using a gradient from 0–500 mm KCl in C-buffer over 20 column volumes. Apparently pure fractions were pooled, whereas fractions containing contaminating proteins were further purified on a MonoQ column (Pharmacia, Germany) using the same gradient as before. However, when elution of SeCys-methyltransferase started, the gradient was held at the same KCl concentration until all protein was eluted. Fractions containing pure protein were combined with the pool from Q-Sepharose chromatography, and SeCys-methyltransferase was precipitated from 70% ammonium sulfate overnight. For long term storage, SeCys-methyltransferase was treated as described for the YagD protein. The direct assay used for the determination of SeCys-methyltransferase activity has been described (15Neuhierl B. Böck A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 239: 235-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). In short, assays were carried out with purified enzyme in an anaerobic hood under an atmosphere of 97% N2 and 3% H2 to avoid oxidation of the substrates, which were pre-reduced for at least 30 min with a 10-fold molar excess of sodium borohydride. Reactions (total volume of 15 μl) consisted of 50 mm sodium citrate buffer, pH 6.0, 10 mm magnesium acetate, 2 mmdithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm methyl acceptor substrate, and the appropriate amount of protein. After 5 min of preincubation at 30 °C, the reaction was started by addition of [methyl- 14C]S-adenosylmethionine (specific activity, 59.3 mCi/mmol, NEN Life Science Products), and incubation was continued at 30 °C. 2.5-μl samples were withdrawn from the reaction mixture at the appropriate times, pipetted into 2.5 μl of glacial acetic acid to stop the reaction, and spotted onto silica gel 60 thin layer chromatography plates in two 2.5-μl portions. Se-[methyl- 14C]selenocysteine was separated from [methyl- 14C]S-adenosylmethionine by developing in 1-butanol:acetic acid:H2O = 4:1:1. After autoradiography, quantification was carried out by densitometry with the aid of a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). Calibration was done by spotting serial dilutions of [methyl- 14C]S-adenosylmethionine stock solutions onto thin layer chromatography plates and by autoradiography on the same screen. The same assay was used for the YagD protein, including 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin in the reaction mixture and changing the pH to 6.5. Reaction velocities with methyl donor substrates other than [methyl- 14C]S-adenosylmethionine were measured indirectly by [14C]iodoacetamide derivatization of remaining selenocysteine; reaction mixtures and conditions were the same as in the assay with [methyl- 14C]S-adenosylmethionine. At appropriate times, 2.5 μl from the reaction were withdrawn and transferred into 2.5 μl of a solution containing a 10-fold molar excess of [14C]iodoacetamide (adjusted to a specific radioactivity of 0.2 mCi/mmol) and kept at room temperature in the dark for 30 min. The mixtures were transferred to silica gel thin layer chromatography plates and treated as described for the [methyl- 14C]S-adenosylmethionine assay (15Neuhierl B. Böck A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 239: 235-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Serial dilutions of selenocysteine were treated likewise and used as standards. The rates of blank reactions without enzyme were subtracted to correct for spontaneous oxidation and non-enzymatic methylation of selenocysteine. As in the direct assay, all experiments were conducted at least in duplicate. l-Selenocysteine was synthesized froml-3-chloroalanine according to Tanaka and Soda (31Tanaka H. Soda K. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 143: 240-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) and was donated by S. Müller (Munich, Germany).dl-Selenohomocysteine was a gift from A. Holmgren (Stockholm, Sweden). All other chemicals were from commercially available sources. A newly constructed positive selection vector (pUKE) was used for cloning of the cDNA sequence coding for the SeCys-methyltransferase from A. bisulcatus. It was derived from pUC19 by exchanging the ampicillin resistance gene for the kanamycin resistance gene from plasmid pUC4KSAC and by ligating into the multiple cloning site the gene (endo) for theEcoRI restriction endonuclease, so that its expression was under the control of the lac promoter. Since production of the EcoRI enzyme is toxic for E. coli K-12 strains (24Kuhn I. Stephenson F.H. Boyer H.W. Greene J. Gene (Amst.). 1986; 44: 253-263Crossref Scopus (35) Google Scholar), this vector allows direct selection for plasmid molecules that contain an insert in the multiple cloning site 5′ of theendo gene. Using oligodeoxyribonucleotides derived from internal peptide sequences of the SeCys-methyltransferase and cDNA from A. bisulcatus, a 1.4-kb cDNA containing the gene (smtA) coding for this protein was cloned by PCR in several steps (see “Experimental Procedures”). Its nucleotide sequence was determined (Fig. 1); it codes for a putative protein of 3"

However, for decades, this disorder has defied molecular characterization. In this study, we characterize the structural organization of the G6P transporter gene and identify mutations in the gene that segregate with the GSD-1b disorder. We report the functional characterization of the recombinant G6P transporter and demonstrate that mutations uncovered in GSD-1b patients disrupt G6P transport. Our results, for the first time, define a molecular basis for functional deficiency in GSD-1b and raise the possibility that the defective G6P transporter contributes to neutropenia and neutrophil/monocyte dysfunctions characteristic of GSD-1b patients.

This abnormality is caused by a deficiency in the activity of microsomal glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase), a key enzyme in glucose homeostasis, which converts glucose 6-phosphate (G6P) to glucose and phosphate (3Nordlie R.C.

It has been proposed that hydrolysis of G6P by intact microsomes requires the participation of several integral membrane proteins, including the G6Pase catalytic unit and a G6P transporter (13Arion W.J.

Kato S. Narisawa K. Tada K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1984; 119: 593-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) using hepatic microsomes from GSD-1b patients. Two complementary approaches have been used to identify the GSD-1b gene. By linkage analysis, we mapped the GSD-1b locus to human chromosome 11q23 (15Annabi B. Hiraiwa H. Mansfield B.C. Lei K.-J. Ubagai T. Polymeropoulos M.H. Moses S.W. Parvari R. Hershkovitz E. Mandel H. Frydman M. Chou J.Y. Am. J. Hum.

By screening an expressed sequence tag data base using a sequence homologous to bacterial transporters of phosphate esters, Gerin et al. (16Gerin I. Veiga-da-Cunha M. Achouri Y. Collet J.-F.

However, characterization of the transporter protein and its function, until now, has remained elusive. We now report the structural organization of the human GSD-1b gene,G6PT, and identify mutations in this gene that segregate with the disorder in members of nine GSD-1b families. We developed a functional G6P transporter assay for the G6PT protein and showed that mutations uncovered in patients with GSD-1b abolish or greatly reduce G6P transport activity. Our study establishes the molecular basis of the GSD-1b disorder and provides ways for the development of DNA-based diagnostic tests for this disorder. The human G6PT cDNA probe (16Gerin I. Veiga-da-Cunha M. Achouri Y. Collet J.-F. Van Schaftingen E. FEBS Lett. 1997; 419: 235-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar) was used to screen a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) library by Research Genetics Inc. (Huntsville, AL), and clone 110-I1, which contains the G6PTgene, was characterized. BAC DNAs were prepared according to the protocol provided by Research Genetics. DNA sequencing was performed using the ABI Prism 310 genetic analyzer (Perkin-Elmer). Eight consanguineous families (families 1–8) and one non-consanguineous family (family 9) included in this study were previously used to map the GSD-1b locus to chromosome 11q23 (15Annabi B. Hiraiwa H. Mansfield B.C. Lei K.-J. Ubagai T. Polymeropoulos M.H. Moses S.W. Parvari R. Hershkovitz E. Mandel H. Frydman M. Chou J.Y. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1998; 62: 400-405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). TheG6PT gene in GSD-1b patients and available family members was characterized by single strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis (20Orita M. Iwahana H. Kanazawa H. Hayashi K. Sekiya T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 2766-2770Crossref PubMed Scopus (3379) Google Scholar) on mutation detection enhancement gels (AT Biochem, Malvern, PA) containing 5% glycerol. Exon-containing fragments were amplified by polymerase chain reaction using primers containing intronic, 5′- or 3′-untranslated sequences of the human G6PTgene. The sense and antisense primers used are: exon 1 (5′-GTGGTCAGAGGCTGTGCGTCT-3′ and 5′-CTGGCTGGTTCTGTGTCCCCA-3′, 248 bp), exon 2 (5′-TCATTGCTCCTGTGTTTCTCC-3′ and 5′-TAGGCATCCTCTATGACAATC-3′, 338 bp), exon 3 (5′-CATCTGACCCCACCCTCAACAT-3′ and 5′-CGCCTAGTCTTCAACAAACATC-3′, 378 bp), exon 4 (5′-AGCAGTCAGGGCAGAGCCTGA-3′ and 5′-CTGCATTGGTTCCTGCTCCTT-3′, 256 bp), exon 5 (5′-CCAATGTGTAACACCCTCCCA-3′ and 5′-TGTCCCAGCCACGCCGTGAAG-3′, 212 bp), exon 6 (5′-TGTTCTGAGGACGTGACATTG-3′ and 5′-GAGACAGAGTCAGTGGCCCTT-3′, 222 bp), exon 8 (5′-CAGGTCGGCTTTCCGACTCTG-3′ and 5′-TTCTCACTGGTCTATATGCAA-3′, 254 bp), and exon 9 (5′-ACTGGCTTAGGTTCTTCCCTT-3′ and 5′-AAGGCCACCGTGGGATGGTGC-3′, 240 bp). SSCP analysis of the 252G→A mutation in members of family 2 was performed by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction amplification of total RNA isolated from cell lines of family members using two oligonucleotide primers derived from nucleotides 139–160 (sense) and 376–395 (antisense) of the human G6PT cDNA (I*, 287 bp). The mutation containing fragments identified by SSCP was subcloned and characterized by DNA sequencing. Nucleotides 166–1486 of the human G6PT cDNA in a pSVL vector (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) were used as a template for mutant construction by polymerase chain reaction. The two outside primers are nucleotides 166–186 (sense) and 1466–1486 of the G6PT cDNA (16Gerin I. Veiga-da-Cunha M. Achouri Y. Collet J.-F. Van Schaftingen E. FEBS Lett. 1997; 419: 235-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Codon 28 (CGC) mutant primers contain CAC at position 28; codon 149 (GGA) mutant primers contain GAA at position 149, and codon 183 (TGT) mutant primers contain CGT at position 183. Bold letters indicate nucleotide changes. After polymerase chain reaction, the amplified fragment was ligated into the pSVL vector. All constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. Transfection in COS-1 cells was performed as described previously (4Lei K.-J. Shelly L.L. Pan C.-J. Sidbury J.B. Chou J.Y. Science. 1993; 262: 580-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar,12Pan C.-J. Lei K.-J. Annabi B. Hemrika W. Chou J.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6144-6148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Each construct was present at 30 μg, and the pSVL vector DNA was included in each transfection to a final concentration of 60 μg of plasmid DNA/150-cm2 flask. Mock transfections with the pSVL vector (60 μg) alone were used as controls. After incubation at 37 °C for 3 days, the transfected cultures were either harvested for microsomal G6P uptake and phosphohydrolase assays or lysed for RNA isolation. Transfection was conducted at a saturation amount of G6PT cDNA (30 μg/150-cm2 flask), and increasing the G6PT cDNA by 2-fold did not alter microsomal G6P uptake activity. G6P uptake measurements were performed essentially as described previously (21Lei K.-J. Chen H. Pan C.-J. Ward J.M. Mosinger B. Lee E.J. Westphal H. Chou J.Y. Nat. Genet. 1996; 13: 203-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar), except sodium cacodylate buffer, which increases G6P uptake efficiency, was used in this study. Briefly, microsomes (40 μg) were incubated in a reaction mixture (100 μl) containing 50 mm sodium cacodylate buffer, pH 6.5, 250 mm sucrose, and 0.2 mm [U-14C]G6P (50 μCi/μmol). The reaction was stopped at the appropriate time by the addition of 50 volumes of an ice-cold solution containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and 250 mm sucrose and filtered immediately through a nitrocellulose filter (BA85, Schleicher & Schuell). Microsomes permeabilized with 0.2% deoxycholate, which abolished G6P uptake, were used as negative controls. Two to three independent experiments were conducted, and at least two G6P uptake studies were performed for each microsomal preparation. Statistical analysis using the unpaired t test was performed with the GraphPad Prism Program (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). Phosphohydrolase assays were performed as described previously (4Lei K.-J. Shelly L.L. Pan C.-J. Sidbury J.B. Chou J.Y. Science. 1993; 262: 580-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). Disrupted microsomal membranes were prepared by incubating intact microsomes in 0.2% deoxycholate for 20 min at 0 °C. Nonspecific phosphatase activity was estimated by preincubating microsomal preparations at pH 5 for 10 min at 37 °C, a condition that inactivates the thermally labile G6Pase. Total RNA was isolated by the guanidinium thiocyanate/CsCl method (22Chirgwin J.M. Przybyla A.E. MacDonald R.J. Rutter W.J. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 5294-5299Crossref PubMed Scopus (16648) Google Scholar), fractionated by electrophoresis through 1.2% agarose gels containing 2.2 m formaldehyde, and transferred to a Nytran membrane by electroblotting. The filters were hybridized to a uniformly labeled G6PT, G6Pase, or β-actin riboprobe. To establish the molecular basis of the GSD-1b disorder, we characterized the structural organization of the human GSD-1b gene,G6PT, isolated from a BAC clone. The G6PT gene (GenBank™ accession number AF097831) spans approximately 5.3 kilobases (Fig. 1 A) and consists of 9 exons: I, 317 bp; II, 233 bp; III, 244 bp; IV, 159 bp; V, 86 bp; VI, 114 bp; VII, 66 bp; VIII, 139 bp; and IX, 748 bp. Exon VII, which was identified in the brain G6PT transcript (23Middleditch C. Clottes E. Burchell A. FEBS Lett. 1998; 433: 33-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), is not present in the liver cDNA (16Gerin I. Veiga-da-Cunha M. Achouri Y. Collet J.-F. Van Schaftingen E. FEBS Lett. 1997; 419: 235-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Southern blot analyses of human genomic DNA and the BAC clone showed that exon sequences were contained within a singleHindIII (∼21 kilobases), SpeI (∼12 kilobases), or HindIII/SpeI (∼9.4 kilobases) fragment (data not shown), suggesting that human G6PT is a single copy gene. SSCP analysis was used to detect mutations in the G6PT gene in members of the nine GSD-1b families studied for mapping the GSD-1b locus to chromosome 11q23 (15Annabi B. Hiraiwa H. Mansfield B.C. Lei K.-J. Ubagai T. Polymeropoulos M.H. Moses S.W. Parvari R. Hershkovitz E. Mandel H. Frydman M. Chou J.Y. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1998; 62: 400-405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Exons I, II, III, IV, V, VI, VIII, and IX, along with their intron junctions, were amplified and analyzed. Homozygous mutations that segregate with the disorder were detected in members of consanguineous GSD-1b families, 1–8 (Fig. 1 B). A total of six different mutations was identified (TableI). The two deletion mutations, 1211delCT and 338delTCGGCAG, resulted in frameshifts that introduce a premature termination codon.Table IMutations identified in the G6PT gene of GSD-1b patientsFamilyExonMutationEffect on coding sequence181211delCTFrameshift at 348, stop at 40021252G→A/R28HArg→His at 28381211delCTFrameshift at 348, stop at 40041252G→A/R28HArg→His at 2852338delTCGGCAGFrameshift at 57, stop at 7264911C→T/Q248XGln→stop at 248791348G→A/W393XTrp→stop at 39383615G→A/G149EGly→Glu at 14992550 + 1G→TAGgt→AGtt at 550 + 1, 5′ splice site93716T→C/C183RCys→Arg at 183 Open table in a new tab SSCP analysis (Fig. 1 B) also detected a missense mutation (716T→C) (Table I) in one allele of the two patients from the non-consanguineous family 9. This mutation was inherited maternally (Fig. 1 B). Because GSD-1b is an autosomal recessive disorder, a second G6PT mutant allele was anticipated, and this mutation was identified after sequencing five G6PT cDNA clones from each patient. Whereas approximately half of the cDNA clones carried the 716T→C mutation, the other half carried a deletion of exon 2 sequences. Sequencing genomic subclones from both patients confirmed that deletion of the exon 2 sequence was caused by a mutation, 550+1G→T, that results in the loss of the splice acceptor for exon 2 (Table I). Sequencing of genomic subclones from both parents also showed that the 550+1G→T mutation is paternally inherited. Kinetic studies of G6P hydrolysis (9Lange A.J. Arion W.J. Beaudet A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 8381-8384Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and transport (14Igarashi Y. Kato S. Narisawa K. Tada K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1984; 119: 593-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) suggest that GSD-1b is caused by a deficiency in microsomal G6P transport. UsingG6Pase-deficient mice, we have shown that G6Pase activity is required for G6P transport into the microsomes (21Lei K.-J. Chen H. Pan C.-J. Ward J.M. Mosinger B. Lee E.J. Westphal H. Chou J.Y. Nat. Genet. 1996; 13: 203-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). To investigate the function of the G6PT protein and its relationship to the G6Pase enzyme, we examined microsomal G6P transport in transient expression studies. COS-1 cells express G6PT but not G6Pase RNA transcripts (19Lin B. Annabi B. Hiraiwa H. Pan C.-J. Chou J.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31656-31670Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar); also a very low level of G6P uptake was detected in microsomes isolated from mock-transfected cells (Fig.2 A). Microsomal G6P transport activity was significantly increased in cells transfected with the G6PT cDNA, indicating that G6PT can function as a transporter (Fig.2 A). This is consistent with studies (24Chen P.Y. Csutora P. Veyna-Burke N.A. Marchase R.B. Diabetes. 1998; 47: 874-881Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) showing that G6P can be taken up by ER/sarcoplasmic reticulum isolated from the brain and the heart, which express the G6PT but not the G6Pasegene (19Lin B. Annabi B. Hiraiwa H. Pan C.-J. Chou J.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31656-31670Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Microsomal G6P transport was also slightly increased in cells transfected with a G6Pase cDNA, although the increase was determined to be statistically insignificant. However, G6P uptake was markedly increased in microsomes isolated from COS-1 cells transfected with both G6PT and G6Pase cDNAs (Fig. 2 A), demonstrating that G6Pase activity facilitates G6P transport into the microsomal lumen by the G6PT protein. The mutual dependence of G6P transporter and G6Pase enzyme on hydrolysis of G6P explains the functional G6Pase deficiency manifested by GSD-1a patients with a defectiveG6Pase gene as well as by GSD-1b patients with an intactG6Pase gene. To further elucidate G6P transport activity of the G6PT protein, we examined the effect of chlorogenic acid (CHA) on G6P uptake. CHA inhibits G6P hydrolysis in intact hepatic microsomes but not in fully disrupted microsomes (25Arion W.J. Canfield W.K. Ramos F.C. Schindler P.W. Burger H.-J. Hemmerle H. Schubert G. Below P. Herling A.W. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 339: 315-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar), suggesting that it might be a specific inhibitor of the G6P transporter. If inhibition of phosphohydrolase activity by CHA in intact hepatic microsomes results from inhibition of the G6P transporter, microsomal G6P uptake should be specifically reduced by this inhibitor. Indeed, 1 mm CHA markedly reduced G6P uptake in mouse hepatic microsomes (Fig. 2 B) as well as in microsomes isolated from COS-1 cells transfected with G6PT and G6Pase cDNAs (Fig. 2 C) or the G6PT cDNA alone (Fig. 2 D). CHA appeared to have no effect on G6P transport in microsomes of G6Pase-transfected COS-1 cells (Fig.2 E). Three missense mutations, R28H, G149E, and C183R, were identified in the G6PT gene of patients from the nine GSD-1b families studied (Table I). To determine the importance of these amino acids in G6P transport, we constructed G6PT mutants and examined microsomal G6P transport activity in transient expression studies. G6P transport in intact microsomes from cells transfected with the G6PT-R28H (Fig.3 A), G6PT-G149E (Fig.3 B), or G6PT-C183R (Fig. 3 C) cDNA alone was barely detectable. Co-transfecting COS-1 cells with G6PT-R28H (Fig.3 A), G6PT-G149E (Fig. 3 B), or G6PT-C183R (Fig.3 C) and a G6Pase cDNA did not restore G6P transport. Our study, for the first time, established the molecular basis of the GSD-1b disorder. Similar amounts of G6P hydrolytic activity were detected in disrupted microsomes of cells transfected either with a G6Pase cDNA alone or a G6Pase cDNA and a G6PT cDNA (Fig. 3 D). Furthermore, co-transfection of a G6Pase cDNA with the wild-type (WT) G6PT cDNA greatly increased phosphohydrolase activity in intact microsomes, suggesting that a functional G6PT protein facilitates G6P hydrolysis. This is in agreement with studies on hepatic microsomes isolated from GSD-1b patients, which suggest that the G6PT protein is required for G6Pase catalysis in vivo. Northern blot analysis confirmed that similar levels of G6PT and/or G6Pase transcripts were expressed in WT or mutant G6PT-transfected COS-1 cells (Fig. 3 E). Our data therefore demonstrate that the decrease in G6P uptake was because of a defective G6PT protein and not because of a decrease in efficiency of expression of the transfected genes. In addition to functional G6Pase deficiency, GSD-1b patients also suffer from neutropenia and functional deficiencies of neutrophils and monocytes (10Beaudet A.L. Anderson D.C. Michels V.V. Arion W.J. Lange A.J. J. Pediatr. 1980; 97: 906-910Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 11Gitzemann R. Bosshard N.U. Eur. J. Pediatr. 1993; 152 Suppl. 1: S33-S38Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Polymorphonuclear leukocytes from GSD-1b patients exhibit impaired mobility and chemotaxis as well as diminished respiratory burst, hexose monophosphate shunt, and phagocytotic activities (reviewed in Ref. 11Gitzemann R. Bosshard N.U. Eur. J. Pediatr. 1993; 152 Suppl. 1: S33-S38Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Moreover, neutrophils and monocytes from GSD-1b patients are unable to sequester Ca2+ (26Kilpatrick L. Garty B.-Z. Lundquist K.F. Hunter K. Stanley C.A. Baker L. Douglas S.D. Korchak H.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1990; 86: 196-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Human neutrophils/monocytes express the G6PT but not theG6Pase gene (19Lin B. Annabi B. Hiraiwa H. Pan C.-J. Chou J.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31656-31670Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), and the G6PT transcript expressed in neutrophils/monocytes is identical to the liver transcript. 2B. Lin and J. Y. Chou, unpublished results. This raised the question as to whether the G6PT protein plays the same role in gluconeogenic and non-gluconeogenic tissues. It has been shown that G6P enhances ATP-dependent microsomal Ca2+sequestration (24Chen P.Y. Csutora P. Veyna-Burke N.A. Marchase R.B. Diabetes. 1998; 47: 874-881Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 27Fulceri R. Romani A. Pompella A. Benedetti A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1022: 129-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), and the presence of ATP and Ca2+also leads to a higher level of G6P accumulation in the ER lumen (24Chen P.Y. Csutora P. Veyna-Burke N.A. Marchase R.B. Diabetes. 1998; 47: 874-881Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In neutrophils and monocytes, G6P stimulates glycolysis and hexose monophosphate shunt activity, which provide the major source of energy for chemotaxis and phagocytosis. Thus, it is possible that the G6PT protein has dual roles dependent upon the tissue or cells in which it is expressed. In gluconeogenic tissues that express high levels of theG6Pase gene the primary function of the G6PT protein is to transport G6P to the ER to be hydrolyzed by G6Pase to produce glucose and phosphate. In other tissues or cells, including neutrophils and monocytes, the G6PT protein may function as a G6P receptor/sensor that regulates Ca2+ sequestration, glycolysis, and hexose monophosphate shunt activity. This could provide an explanation for the observations that despite possessing an intact G6Pase gene, GSD-1b patients manifest neutrophil and monocyte dysfunctions as well as a functional G6Pase deficiency. The knowledge of the G6PT gene structure now permits the generation of a G6PT-deficient mouse model to increase our understanding of the biology and pathophysiology of GSD-1b and to facilitate the development of novel therapeutic approaches for this disorder.

Although most of our knowledge on AP function is derived from studies on their subcellular localization and interaction with membranes or cytoplasmic domains of membrane proteins, little is based on in vivo functional studies or genetic approaches. Deletion of genes of AP subunits in yeast did not reveal the function of AP-1 and AP-2 but was informative in the case of AP-3. Mutations of the four AP-1 and AP-2 subunits did not result in a mutant phenotype and only the combination of AP-1 mutations with a temperature-sensitive clathrin heavy-chain mutation enhanced the reduced growth rate observed in the clathrin heavy-chain mutant (9Stepp D.J.

No biochemical data for cargo-AP-1 interactions are available in the yeast system. The AP-3 is needed for an alternative pathway from the TGN to the vacuole, which is utilized by the vacuolar alkaline phosphatase and the vacuolar t-SNARE Vam3p and does not depend on clathrin (12Vowels J.J. Payne G.S. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2482-2493Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). In Drosophila melanogaster AP-3 is involved in the formation of pigment granules, as indicated by garnet, an eye color mutant caused by mutations in one of the AP-3 subunits (8Simpson F. Peden A.A. Christopoulou L. Robinson M.S. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 835-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar, 13Ooi C.E. Moreira J.E. Dell'Angelica E.C. Poy G. Wassarman D.A. Bonifacino J.S. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4508-4518Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Further support for a role of AP-3 in pigment granule formation comes from the naturally occurring mouse mutants mocha and pearl, which belong to a larger group of mouse mutants with abnormal pigmentation, prolonged bleeding time, and altered lysosomal sorting. Mocha as well as pearl mice carry mutations in AP-3 subunits (14Kantheti P. Qiao X. Diaz M.E. Peden A.A. Meyer G.E. Carskadon S.L. Kapfhamer D. Sufalko D. Robinson M.S. Noebels J.L. Burmeister M.

In an in vitro system, synaptic vesicle formation from endosomes of PC12 cells is dependent on the neuronal isoform of AP-3 (7Faúndez V. Horng J.-T. Kelly R.B. Cell. 1998; 93: 423-432Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). The AP-1 has been found in clathrin-coated buds on the TGN. Binding of AP-1 to the TGN depends on the GTPase ARF1 (16Stamnes M.A. Rothman J.E. Cell. 1993; 73: 999-1005Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). The AP-1 consists of two 100-kDa adaptins, γ and β1, a 47-kDa adaptin, μ1, and a 19-kDa adaptin, ς1. Of the four AP-1 subunits, γ-adaptin as well as β1-adaptin interact with clathrin (3Schmid S.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 511-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (669) Google Scholar). The C-terminal 511 of 822 amino acids of γ-adaptin and the β1-adaptin subunit are dispensable for TGN binding (17Page L.J. Robinson M.S. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 619-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). AP-1 recruits clathrin on to the membranes by binding to the clathrin heavy chain and to the cytoplasmic tails of membrane (cargo) proteins. The μ1 adaptin interacts with tyrosine-based sorting sequences in the cytoplasmic tails of cargo proteins (18Ohno H. Fournier M.C. Poy G. Bonifacino J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29009-29015Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Leucine-based sorting signals in the cytoplasmic tails bind to μ1 or β1 adaptin (19Rodionov D.G.

AP-1 binding cargo molecules are the mannose-6-phosphate receptors, MPR46 and MPR300, the lysosomal membrane protein, LAMP 1, the invariant chain of the major histocompatibility complex class II receptor, the CD3γ subunit of the TCRαβ·CD3 receptor complex and the varicella zoster virus glycoprotein I (21Alconada A.

The significance of the AP-1-mediated packaging into clathrin-coated vesicles at the TGN for the trafficking of these membrane proteins and their biological function is not clear. Most of the cargo proteins are found at the plasma membrane as well as in endosomal/lysosomal membranes. Disruption of their interaction with the AP-1 must not necessarily prevent the targeting to their destination, as has been demonstrated for LAMP 1 (23Höning S. Griffith J. Geuze H.J. Hunziker W. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5230-5239Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 28Rohrer J. Schweizer A. Russell D. Kornfeld S. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 565-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Replacing the glycine residue in the GYxxI sorting signal by alanine, interferes with binding to AP-1, but not to AP-2, and allows transport to endosomes/lysosomes via the cell surface, albeit at the expense of an increased steady-state concentration at the plasma membrane (29Höning S. Hunziker W. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 321-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). To obtain insight into the in vivo role of AP-1, we rendered the γ-adaptin gene of AP-1 nonfunctional in mice. AP-1-deficient mouse embryos die before nidation, and even heterozygous animals display a reduced growth rate during nursing. Although the life cycle of yeast does not depend on AP-1 function, it is essential for development of a higher eukaryotic organism such as mice. A 1.3-kb PstI fragment of the mouse γ-adaptin cDNA corresponding to the N-terminal half of the protein was used to screen a mouse phage DNA library in EMBL3 (30Robinson M.S. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 2319-2326Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). 3Generous gift of A. Berns, Amsterdam. Seven library clones were isolated that contained two different chromosomal DNA fragments. Adtg MspI polymorphisms were detected between Mus musculus and Mus spretus with a 1-kb PstI cDNA probe encoding the C-terminal half of the protein and with a chromosomal DNA probe (see Fig. 1 A, probe 2). Hybridization of a 3.8-kb MspI fragment of M. musculus and a 6.7-kb MspI fragment of M. spretus was seen with the cDNA as a probe. The chromosomal DNA probe hybridized with a 5.6-kb fragment from M. musculus and with a 5-kb fragment from M. spretus. DNA from 94 animals, produced by crossingM. spretus with animals having a M. musculus/M. spretus genetic background, were hybridized with both probes after MspI incubation. The hybridization pattern was analyzed using a computer program (Jackson Laboratory, Maine). The 5.5-kb PstI fragment that contained the 123-bp exon was subcloned into the cloning plasmid pBluescript SKII+ (Stratagene). A BglII-restriction endonuclease site was introduced into the exon by oligonucleotide site-directed mutagenesis (5′-GCCAATGCGTAGATCTGTGAATTTTTG-3′). Mutation was confirmed by DNA sequencing. The neo Rexpression cassette from pMC1neopA (Stratagene) was cloned into theBglII site of the exon as a 1.2-kb BamHI fragment, and the construct with opposing open reading frames was used. To select against nonhomologues recombination events the thymidine kinase gene was introduced in the polylinker, flanking the “knock-out” construct. Constructs with and without the thymidine kinase gene were linearized by NotI digest and electroporated into the mouse 129SV/J embryonic stem cell line ES-14-1. ES cells were cultured as described previously (31Kidder G.M. Dev. Genet. 1992; 13: 319-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 32Hogan B. Beddington R. Costantini F. Lacy E. Manipulating the Mouse Embryo. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Plainview, NY1994Google Scholar). Forty-five G418-resistant ES cell clones derived from the targeting vector without the thymidine kinase gene were tested for the homologous recombination event. Four positive clones were found. Mutated ES cells were injected into day 3.5 pc blastocysts, which were then transferred into the uteri of pseudopregnant foster mothers. Three male chimeras were borne and mated with C57/Bl6 (outbred) and 129SV/J (outbred) (31Kidder G.M. Dev. Genet. 1992; 13: 319-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 32Hogan B. Beddington R. Costantini F. Lacy E. Manipulating the Mouse Embryo. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Plainview, NY1994Google Scholar). Mice strains were purchased from Biological Research Laboratories, Basel. Colonies were kept in a central animal facility at the University of Göttingen. Superovulation was done by injecting 5 units of serum from pregnant mares (Sigma) at midday intraperitoneally into 6–8-week-old females and by a second injection of 10 units of human chorionic gonadotropin (Sigma) 46 h later. Animals were immediately mated thereafter, and seminal plaques were checked the next morning. The mouse was sacrificed at day 3.5 in the early afternoon. The isolated uteri were washed with PBS and flushed with 1 ml of M2 medium (31Kidder G.M. Dev. Genet. 1992; 13: 319-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 32Hogan B. Beddington R. Costantini F. Lacy E. Manipulating the Mouse Embryo. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Plainview, NY1994Google Scholar). On average, 25 blastocysts were collected per animal. Genotyping: blastocysts were washed twice with PBS and then transferred into 0.5-ml Eppendorf cups containing 5 μl of water. After adding 5 μl of PBS they were frozen on dry ice for 10 min followed by 10 min of incubation at 95 °C. After the addition of 2 μl of proteinase K (Boehringer Mannheim; stock 10 mg/ml) they were incubated at 56 °C for 30 min and cooled on ice. A second incubation was done at 95 °C for 10 min and samples were frozen at −80 °C. All of the material was used for polymerase chain reaction under standard conditions. In a first polymerase chain reaction amplification, two exon primers, 5′-GCCATAGGAATGCAAAC-3′ and 5′-GTAAGTAGCTACTCTTAC-3′, were used to amplify wild-type and mutagenized exons. 30 μl were loaded onto a 2% agarose gel and further analyzed by Southern hybridization using probe 2 (see Fig. 1 A), and 40 μl were purified via a spin column by a Qiagen kit according to the manufacturer's manual. All of the purified material was used for neoR polymerase chain reaction using the oligonucleotides 5′-CGGATCAAGCGTATGCAGCCG-3′ and 5′-CAAGATGGATTGCACGCAGG-3′. Polymerase chain reaction products were separated in a 2% agarose gel and further analyzed by Southern analysis using the 1.2-kb neomycin BamHI fragment. Organs were homogenized in 0.1 m MES buffer, pH 6.5, 1 mm EGTA, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 0.02% NaN3, 2 μg/ml pepstatin, 2 μg/ml leupeptin A, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 5 mmiodoacetamide. Tissue fragments and unbroken cells were removed by centrifugation at 1000 × g over 10 min. The supernatant was separated into a membranous and cytosolic fraction by centrifugation at 100,000 × g over 45 min. Gel filtration was done on a Superdex-200 column (Smart-System, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) at a flow rate of 40 μl/min and a sample volume of 50 μl with 5 μg/μl protein. Fraction volume was 30 μl. Column was calibrated with blue dextran, thyroglobulin, ferritin, catalase, aldolase, bovine serum albumin, ovalbumin, and cytochrome C. Proteins (50 μg of crude cell extract and the entire gel filtration fractions) were resolved on a Laemmli gel and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (Sartorius). Adaptins were detected with anti-γ- and anti-β-adaptin mouse monoclonal antibodies (both 1:5,000 dilution) (Transduction Laboratories) and an anti-mouse μ1 polyclonal rabbit antiserum (1:500 dilution) raised against amino acids 291–310. Anti-LAMP1 (1D4B) was a rat monoclonal antibody (1:1,000 dilution) (Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank, University of Iowa). Protein-antibody complexes were made visible by chemiluminescence (Super-SignalTM, Pierce) and x-ray film exposure. X-rays were scanned and quantified (Wincam software). Membranes were stripped by incubation in 0.2 m NaOH over 5 min and blocked again with 5% milk powder and 0.1% Tween 20 in PBS. Total fibroblast RNA was isolated using a kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. 10 μg of RNA were separated on a 1% agarose gel, transferred onto a nylon membrane (Amersham), and UV cross-linked. cDNAs were labeled with [α-32P]dCTP using a labeling kit (Amersham). Membranes were stripped by boiling in 0.1% SDS for rehybridization of the membrane. Signals were quantified by phosphoimager analyses (Fujitsu). Animals from a litter were analyzed in parallel when they were 5–7 weeks old. They were kept in the same or neighboring cages in the central animal facility of the university. Thymus and spleen were isolated, washed in HEPES/Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) and broken up using a Tenbroek homogenizator (Tecnomara AG, Hüttenberg). Cells were counted and washed twice in PBS. 106 cells were transferred to fluorescence-activated cell sorter tubes and labeled with antibodies for 1 h on ice: anti-CD4-FITC, anti-CD8-PE, anti-CD3ε-FITC, anti-CD4-PE, anti-B220/CD45R-PE, anti-IgM-FITC, anti-rat IgG2a-PE (all PharMingen), and anti-CD8-QR (Sigma). Cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS and analyzed using a FACScan and Lysis II software (Becton Dickinson). A genomic mouse phage DNA library was screened with a mouse γ-adaptin cDNA fragment. Two different chromosomal DNA fragments, each about 16-kb in length, were identified in seven purified phage clones. On each fragment only a single exon was found using cDNA as a probe. One clone contained a 123-bp exon, encoding amino acids 68–108 of 822 (see Fig.1 A). The other clone contained an exon of 75 bp (not shown) encoding amino acids 189–214. The γ-adaptin gene Adtg could be localized on mouse chromosome 8 at 52 cM between the markers D8Bwg1112e andD8Bir26 using two different Adtg MspI polymorphisms, distinguishing M. musculus and M. spretus (see Materials and Methods, data accessible at mouse genomic data base, Jackson Laboratory, Maine). Neither pseudogenes nor homologues of Adtg were found in the mouse genome. The exon encoding amino acids 68–108 was choosen to construct the targeting vector (see Fig. 1 A). A 5.5-kb PstI fragment containing the 123-bp exon was subcloned into the plasmid pBS. A BglII site was introduced into the exon 45 bp after the start of the exon corresponding to bp 245 of the cDNA by oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis, and the neomycin-resistant (neoR) gene was cloned into the BglII site as a 1.2-kb BamHI-fragment. To select against nonhomologous recombination events the thymidine kinase gene was introduced into the targeting construct at the 3′-site of the γ-adaptin sequences. The constructs with and without the thymidine kinase gene were electroporated into mouse embryonic stem cells. Four homologous recombination events with the targeting construct lacking the thymidine kinase gene were detected in 45 ES cell clones (probe 2; see Fig. 1, A and B). Cells from two targeted embryonic stem cell clones were injected into blastocysts. Cells from one clone integrated in the embryos. Three chimeric male mice were obtained that transmitted the targetedadtg allele to about 25% of the offspring from C57BL/6J (outbred) and 129SV/J (inbred) females. When γ-adaptin heterozygotes were intercrossed, no γ-adaptin −/− animals were observed among the 108 newborns genotyped (Table I), indicating that absence of γ-adaptin causes embryonic lethality.Table IStatistics of the genotyping of newborn mice and embryos at different stages of developmentAgeNo. GenotypedGenotyped+/++/−−/−Newborn10835 (32%)73 (68%)NDaND, not detected.

Open table in a new tab Crosses of heterozygotes were performed and animals were sacrificed at different time points. Chromosomal DNA was isolated from the tail tips of newborn animals or from isolated embryos and blastocysts and genotyped by polymerase chain reaction. Identified genotypes are given as total numbers of individuals and the percentage. To determine the stage where embryonic development ceases, pregnancies were terminated starting at day 13.5 pc, the last day of organogenesis in mouse development, to 8.5 pc. None of 20 embryos was homozygous for the targeted Adtg allele (see Table I). Twelve of 58 blastocysts isolated at day 3.5 pc were homozygous and 31 were heterozygous for the targeted Adtg allele, revealing an almost mendelian distribution of the γ-adaptin mutation (see Table Iand Fig. 2). The blastocysts displayed a normal morphology with a zona pellucida, trophectoderm, inner cell mass, and a blastocoele. Shortly before nidation at day 4.5 pc to 5 pc, blastocysts hatch from their zona pellucida and are characterized by an elongated shape. Blastocysts with these characteristics were found also among the day 3.5 pc blastocysts because of the asynchrony of the early stages in development. None of the 29 embryos with this morphology turned out to be of the −/− genotype, suggesting that γ-adaptin deficiency is not compatible with development to day 4.5 pc. To establish −/− cell lines from the inner cell mass, day 3.5 pc blastocysts were transferred onto feeder cell cultures and cultivated for 2 days in the presence of leukemia inhibitory factor, which stimulates growth and preserves the pluripotent state of cells of the inner cell mass. Sixteen of 23 blastocysts attached to the feeder cells and formed colonies. They were transferred into feeder cell-free plastic Petri dishes and allowed to attach and expand. Twelve of these could be successfully genotyped. The inner cell mass of wild-type and +/− embryos developed on the feeder cells into colonies, attached to the plastic surface and formed monolayers. Three of the blastocysts were γ-adaptin-deficient. The trophoblast cells and cells of the pluripotent inner cell mass enlarged significantly, indicating differentiation or cell death (not shown). The −/− cells failed to spread onto the plastic surface, divide, and establish colonies. Analysis of expression levels of the γ-adaptin protein in cultured day 12.5 pc embryonic fibroblasts and in liver, brain, and thymus of adult animals by Western blotting revealed a decrease of 50% in +/− cells compared with the +/+ cells (see Fig.3). γ-Adaptin mRNA levels were reduced to 30% in cultured embryonic fibroblasts, liver, kidney, and brain. In all tissues, a 2.8-kb γ-adaptin transcript was seen. Fig.3 B shows mRNA levels of adaptins in embryonic fibroblasts. μ1 and ς1 adaptin mRNAs were not altered in fibroblasts. Cytosolic proteins of cultured +/− embryonic fibroblasts were separated by gel filtration to analyze whether the excess of β1, μ1, and ς1 adaptins of the AP-1 complex form smaller or larger complexes or accumulate as free subunits. Column fractions were analyzed by Western blotting (see Fig.4). The wild-type AP-1 complex was detected by anti-γ mouse monoclonal antibody, a mouse monoclonal antibody recognizing β1 and β2 or an antiserum specific for μ1. The AP-1 complex was found in fractions 7–10 (M r of 400,000). No adaptor complexes of a smaller or larger size or free β and μ1 adaptins were found in the other fractions of the gradient. This suggests that the excess of β1 and μ1 are not stable. Pulse-chase experiments were performed with the fibroblasts to analyze the MPR-dependent sorting of cathepsin D to lysosomes. No differences were observed between the +/+ and +/− cell lines (not shown). We observed differences in size between 4-week-old +/+ and +/− littermates. A cohort of 9 +/− male mice and 6 +/+ males of the outbred (C57/Bl6) colony were weighed from day 6.5 postnatal to 100 postnatal, and a second group of 27 +/− and 11 +/+ mice were weighed between 3 and 10 months of age. Data of the periods between day 6–21 and day 100–320 were analyzed by least square linear regression (Fig.5 A). The weight difference developed within the first 3 weeks after birth. Between day 6–21 postnatal the body weight of +/− male mice increased by 0.23 g/d compared with 0.40 g/d in +/+ males. At day 21 postnatal, litters were separated from their mothers, and weaning caused a growth arrest for 2 to 4 days. Thereafter +/− mice grew as fast as +/+ mice, thus maintaining their 2.5 g lighter body weight for at least up to 10 months of age. This growth difference was independent of the genetic background, although animals of the inbred colony grew slower then outbred animals, and females grew slower then males. Histological analysis of liver, thymus, spleen, and kidney did not reveal morphological abnormalities in heterozygous animals. We analyzed thymocytes and splenocytes of 5–7-week-old littermates for T- and B-lymphocyte development by flow cytometry, because we expected this developmental system to be sensitive to alterations in receptor trafficking. Thymocytes were analyzed using antibodies against CD4, CD8, and CD3. Antibodies against B220/CD45R and IgM were used to analyze B-lymphocytes. The total number of lymphocytes in spleen and thymus was not affected. In the thymus of +/− animals, the number of CD4+ single-positive T cells was reduced by 20%, whereas the number of CD8+ single-positive T cells was hardly affected (see Fig. 5 B). Cell surface expression of CD4 and CD8 on CD3+ cells was not altered. No abnormalities were found for splenocytes or the tissue architecture of thymus and spleen. The AP-1 complex of clathrin-coated vesicles at the TGN has a function in protein sorting, but its role in post-Golgi vesicular transport and its biological significance are poorly understood (3Schmid S.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 511-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (669) Google Scholar). We rendered the γ-adaptin gene of AP-1 nonfunctional in mice. γ-Adaptin −/− embryos were found at day 3.5 pc, but they died within the following 24 h before nidation. At day 2.5 pc of mouse development, translation of maternal mRNA stops and zygotic mRNA appears (31Kidder G.M. Dev. Genet. 1992; 13: 319-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Thus protein levels of γ-adaptin will begin to decline in −/− blastocysts at day 2.5 pc. Apparently development of −/− blastocysts ceases, when γ-adaptin declines below a threshold because of the lack of embryonically encoded γ-adaptin. This phenotype is probably not caused by absence of just the γ-adaptin subunit, but by the absence of the entire AP-1 complex. In +/− cells the amount of γ-adaptin is reduced to 50%. We tested whether β1, μ1, and ς1 are in excess in these cells. mRNA levels of these subunits are not altered, but we failed to detect β1 or μ1 as free subunits or as partial complexes missing the γ-adaptin. We conclude from this that γ-adaptin governs AP-1 complex formation, probably by acting as a scaffold, and that other adaptins are unstable in the absence of γ. We tried to establish −/− cell lines by cultivating cells of the inner cell mass from day 3.5 pc blastocysts. The inner cell mass of +/+ and +/− blastocysts grew in vitro, but cells from −/− blastocysts did not proliferate. The severity of the γ-adaptin −/− phenotype in mice is surprising given the absence of any phenotype of the yeast AP-1 mutants. It is suggestive to ascribe the lethality to the missorting of some functionally important proteins caused by the absence of AP-1. Receptors that normally interact with AP-1 are expected to become transferred in the absence of AP-1 to the plasma membrane rather than to endosomes. This occurs for example when, in these transmembrane proteins, domains interacting with AP-1 are deleted (33Hille-Rehfeld A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1241: 177-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 34Mathews P.M. Martinie J.B. Fambrough D.M. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 1027-1040Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Lethality could thus be due to the abnormal presence of these transmembrane proteins at the cell surface and/or from their deficiency at the normal site of their action. The MPRs are responsible for the recruitment of the majority of AP-1 complexes to the TGN (35Le Borgne R. Hoflack B. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 335-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), and they serve as receptors for soluble lysosomal enzymes and insulin-like growth factor II. Mice lacking both MPRs are viable albeit at a reduced rate (36Ludwig T. Eggenschwiler J. Fisher P. D'Ercole A.J. Davenport M.L. Efstratiadis A. Dev.

AP-1 could be important for prohormone processing and secretion of proteins critical for embryonic development. AP-1 is found on maturing secretory granula where it binds to the prohormone-processing protease furin (5Dittié A.S. Thomas L. Thomas G. Tooze S.A.

The presently known growth factors controlling embryonic development during the prenidation period are provided to the embryo by the mother. The failure of proper preimplantation development of −/− embryos is therefore unlikely to result from defects in growth factor processing and secretion (39Stewart C.L. Kaspar P. Brunet L.J. Bhatt H. Gadi I. Kontgen F. Abbondanzo S.J. Nature. 1992; 359: 76-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (1739) Google Scholar, 40Feldman B. Poueymirou W. Papaioannou V.E. DeChiara T.M. Goldfarb M. Science. 1995; 267: 246-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (623) Google Scholar). It could, however, also result from a failure of growth factor trafficking. Blastocyst development depends on maternal growth factors, which stimulate blastocyst growth and maintain the pluripotent state of the inner cell mass. These factors are transcytosed through the trophectoderm (41Stewart C.L. Cullinan E.B. Dev. Genet. 1997; 21: 91-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). At the day 3.5 to 4.5 of mouse development, blastocysts hatch out of the zona pellucida. Cells of the mural trophectoderm produce a trypsin-like protease, which generates an opening in the zona pellucida through which the blastocyst hatches, leaving an empty zona pellucida behind (42Perona R.M. Wassarman P.M. Dev. Biol. 1986; 114: 42-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). γ-Adaptin-deficient blastocysts are not able to proceed through these developmental steps. That AP-1 is dispensable for the unicellular yeast in fact argues for an essential role of AP-1 during the development of a multicellular organism. It was surprising to see a phenotype in γ-adaptin +/− heterozygotes, in which AP-1 is reduced to half the normal level. The growth deficiency in heterozygotes as well as the decrease of CD4+/CD8− T-cells in the thymus points to a rate-limiting function of AP-1 in some tissues, which cannot be explained by the known AP-1 transport functions. However, the transport of lysosomal enzymes in γ-adaptin +/− embryonic fibroblasts was normal. This indicates that AP-1 is not rate limiting for trafficking of MPRs, despite the fact that MPRs constitute the major cargo proteins recruiting AP-1 to the TGN (35Le Borgne R. Hoflack B. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 335-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Related adaptor complexes exist, which may compensate the loss of AP-1. The sequences of a human and mouse γ-adaptin homologue, named γ2-adaptin, have recently been published, 4Lewin, D. A., Sheff, D., Ooi, C. E., Whitney, J. A., Yornamoto, E., Chicione, L., Webster, P., Bonifacino, J. S., and Mellman, I. (1998) GenBankTM accession numbers AF068707 andAF068706. which are 60% homologous to γ-adaptin. Obviously this protein cannot compensate for the loss of γ-adaptin and must therefore fullfill a different function. This study has shown that the AP-1 complex has a unique and essential role in mice at the TGN or on endosomes, which cannot be fullfilled by known or unknown adaptor complexes. That γ-adaptin has a particular role is demonstrated by a mouse knock-out of the μ1-adaptin subunit. These mice develop until midorganogenesis. In cell lines established from the embryos, a trimeric ΔμAP-1 complex is formed, indicating that this complex is able to fulfill some AP-1 function in Δμ1 cells. 5C. Meyer and P. Schu, unpublished observation. Application of antisense technology to cell lines from γ-adaptin +/− heterozygotes may be helpful to achieve a graded reduction in the γ-adaptin levels so that the critical threshold of AP-1 for viability could be determined, and the consequences of AP-1 deficiency could be analyzed.

https://openalex.org/W2073140843,"The homotetrameric M2 integral membrane protein of influenza virus forms a proton-selective ion channel. An essential histidine residue (His-37) in the M2 transmembrane domain is believed to play an important role in the conduction mechanism of this channel. Also, this residue is believed to form hydrogen-bonded interactions with the ammonium group of the anti-viral compound, amantadine. A molecular model of this channel suggests that the imidazole side chains of His-37 from symmetry-related monomers of the homotetrameric pore converge to form a coordination site for transition metals. Thus, membrane currents of oocytes of Xenopus laevis expressing the M2protein were recorded when the solution bathing the oocytes contained various transition metals. Membrane currents were strongly and reversibly inhibited by Cu2+ with biphasic reaction kinetics. The biphasic inhibition curves may be explained by a two-site model involving a fast-binding peripheral site with low specificity for divalent metal ions, as well as a high affinity site (K diss ∼2 μm) that lies deep within the pore and shows rather slow-binding kinetics (k on = 18.6 ± 0.9m−1 s−1). The pH dependence of the interaction with the high affinity Cu2+-binding site parallels the pH dependence of inhibition by amantadine, which has previously been ascribed to protonation of His-37. The voltage dependence of the inhibition at the high affinity site indicates that the binding site lies within the transmembrane region of the pore. Furthermore, the inhibition by Cu2+ could be prevented by prior application of the reversible blocker of M2 channel activity, BL-1743, providing further support for the location of the site within the pore region of M2. Finally, substitutions of His-37 by alanine or glycine eliminated the high affinity site and resulted in membrane currents that were only partially inhibited at millimolar concentrations of Cu2+. Binding of Cu2+ to the high affinity site resulted in an approximately equal inhibition of both inward and outward currents. The wild-type protein showed very high specificity for Cu2+ and was only partially inhibited by 1 mm Ni2+, Pt2+, and Zn2+.

In addition, in influenza virus-infected cells the M2 protein causes the equilibration of pH between the acidic lumen of the trans-Golgi network and the cytoplasm (reviewed in Refs. 1Hay A.J. Semin. Virol. 1992; 3: 21-30Google Scholar and 2Lamb R.A. Holsinger L.J. Pinto L.H. Wimmer E. Receptor-mediated Virus Entry into Cells. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1994: 303-321Google Scholar). The M2protein contains a 24-residue N-terminal extracellular domain, a single internal hydrophobic domain of 19 residues which acts as a transmembrane domain and forms the pore of the channel, and a 54-residue cytoplasmic tail (3Lamb R.A. Zebedee S.L. Richardson C.D. Cell. 1985; 40: 627-633Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). Chemical cross-linking studies showed the M2 protein to be minimally a homotetramer (4Sugrue R.J. Hay A.J. Virology. 1991; 180: 617-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar, 5Panayotov P.P.

Virology. 1991; 183: 32-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar), and statistical analysis of the ion channel activity of mixed oligomers indicated that the minimal active oligomer is a homotetramer (7Sakaguchi T. Tu Q. Pinto L.H. Lamb R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5000-5005Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Despite the small size of the active M2 oligomer, several pieces of evidence indicate that the ion channel activity is intrinsic to the M2 protein. First, ion channel activity has also been observed in two expression systems in addition to oocytes, mammalian cells (8Chizhmakov I.V. Geraghty F.M. Ogden D.C. Hayhurst A. Antoniou M. Hay A.J. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1996; 494: 329-336Crossref Scopus (260) Google Scholar) and yeast (9Kurtz S. Luo G. Hahnenberger K.M. Brooks C. Gecha O. Ingalls K. Numata K.-I. Krystal M. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1995; 39: 2204-2209Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Second, the activity has also been reconstituted in artificial lipid bilayers (10Tosteson M.T. Pinto L.H. Holsinger L.J. Lamb R.A. J. Membr. Biol. 1994; 142: 117-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) from purified M2 protein. The currents associated with the M2ion channel are inhibited by amantadine, its methyl derivative rimantadine, and the spirene-containing compound BL-1743 (Structure Fs1). Mutant viruses resistant to amantadine or BL-1743 have been isolated, and most have been found to map to the extracellular half of the transmembrane domain of the M2 protein (11Hay A.J. Wolstenholme A.J. Skehel J.J. Smith M.H. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 3021-3024Crossref PubMed Scopus (694) Google Scholar, 12Holsinger L.J. Nichani D. Pinto L.H. Lamb R.A. J.

These mutant M2 proteins have ion channel activity that is insensitive to the compound used to generate the resistant mutant virus (8Chizhmakov I.V. Geraghty F.M. Ogden D.C. Hayhurst A. Antoniou M.

Virol. 1993; 67: 5585-5594Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Inhibition by BL-1743 also has the useful property that, unlike inhibition by amantadine, it is reversible on the time scale of physiological experiments (15Tu Q. Pinto L.H. Luo G. Shaughnessy M.A. Mullaney D. Kurtz S. Krystal M. Lamb R.A. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 4246-4252Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The ion selectivity of the M2 ion channel has been examined with ion substitution and reversal voltage measurements. The channel possesses at least 105-fold selectivity for H+(8Chizhmakov I.V.

J. 1996; 70: 1336-1346Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (123) Google Scholar). This finding has been confirmed with intracellular pH measurements, but the former experiments indicate that other monovalent cations such as Na+ also permeate (17Shimbo K. Brassard D.L. Lamb R.A. Pinto L.H. Biophys. J. 1996; 70: 1336-1346Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Recently, we proposed a model for the three-dimensional structure of the transmembrane region of M2, based on a mathematical analysis of the functional properties of a series of mutants (18Pinto L.H. Dieckmann G.R. Gandhi C.S. Papworth C.G. Braman J. Shaughnessy M.A. Lear J.D. Lamb R.A. DeGrado W.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11301-11306Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). The predicted structure consists of four α-helices arranged with approximate 4-fold symmetry about a central channel, which spans the transmembrane region of the protein. This model is in very good agreement with spectroscopic data (19Duff K. Kelly S. Price N. Bradshaw J. FEBS Lett. 1992; 311: 256-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 20Duff K.C. Cudmore A.J. Bradshaw J.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1145: 149-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 21Kovacs F.A. Cross T.A. Biophys. J. 1997; 73: 2511-2517Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar) and with an independently proposed structure based on molecular dynamics calculations (22Sansom M.S.P. Kerr I.D. Smith G.R. Son H.S. Virology. 1997; 233: 163-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Our model provides a rationale for the proton selectivity of the channel; the tetramer defines a continuous, water-filled pore, which is interrupted at only one position, His-37 (Fig.1 A) which may act as a proton shuttle similar to that of carbonic anhydrase (23Silverman D.N. Lindskog S. Acc. Chem. Res. 1988; 21: 30-36Crossref Scopus (691) Google Scholar, 24Nair S.K. Christianson D.W. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1991; 113: 9455-9458Crossref Scopus (211) Google Scholar). A considerable body of evidence shows that His-37 is indeed essential for the activity of M2, and mutation of this residue leads to a channel that conducts ions in a pH-independent manner (25Wang C. Lamb R.A. Pinto L.H. Biophys. J. 1995; 69: 1363-1371Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Amantadine inhibits M2 with a dissociation constant of approximately 0.2 μm and a relatively slow rate of association (16Wang C. Takeuchi K. Pinto L.H. Lamb R.A. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 5585-5594Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This drug binds to the channel with a half-time on the order of 10–20 min when the drug is present at low micromolar concentrations (the second order rate constant ranges from 150 to 1000m−1 s−1 for M2 from different amantadine-sensitive subtypes of virus). Interestingly, another positively charged, hydrophobic drug, BL-1743, is known to bind M2 at a similar rate, although its rate of dissociation varies widely; the half-time for dissociation of BL-1743 from M2 is approximately 3 min (15Tu Q. Pinto L.H. Luo G. Shaughnessy M.A. Mullaney D. Kurtz S. Krystal M. Lamb R.A. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 4246-4252Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), while amantadine dissociates at a rate too slow to be experimentally measured. The relatively slow rates at which these drugs associate with the channel may relate to the mechanism by which they enter the pore. Both drugs are relatively bulky and may experience some steric hindrance as they enter the channel. In addition, the partial or full dehydration of positively charged groups as the drugs enter the channel may be energetically difficult, leading to a slow rate of penetration. We suggest that these drugs interact with the lining of the pore, which is composed primarily of hydrophobic groups that form a widening near the center of the bilayer similar to that found in the K+channel (26Doyle D.A. Cabral J.M. Pfuetzner R.A. Kuo A. Gulbis J.M. Cohen S.L. Chait B.T. MacKinnon R. Science. 1998; 280: 69-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (5746) Google Scholar). To test further the role of His-37 in the function and inhibition of M2, we have examined the ability of Cu(II) to inhibit the channel. Examination of the model (Fig. 1) indicated that this ion could interact with the four histidine imidazole groups similarly to the role proposed for histidine as the chelating ligand for Cu(II) binding to prion protein (27Stoeckel J. Safar J. Wallace A.C. Cohen F.E. Prusiner S.B. Biochem. 1998; 37: 7185-7193Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar). We demonstrate that Cu(II) indeed binds to a high affinity site within the protein in a slow, time-dependent process. Site-specific mutagenesis of M2 cDNA was performed as described previously (15Tu Q. Pinto L.H. Luo G. Shaughnessy M.A. Mullaney D. Kurtz S. Krystal M. Lamb R.A. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 4246-4252Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Duff K. Kelly S. Price N. Bradshaw J. FEBS Lett. 1992; 311: 256-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). In vitrosynthesis of mRNA was performed using the mMessage mMachine T7 Transcription Kit (Ambion, Austin, TX). Ovarian lobules from individually identified Xenopus laevis females (Nasco, Fort Atkinson, WI) were surgically removed and treated with collagenase B (2 mg/ml; Boehringer Mannheim) in Ca2+-free OR-2 solution (82.5 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1 mmMgCl2, 5 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.5) at 24 °C for 30–45 min to liberate oocytes from follicle cells. Defolliculated oocytes were washed in OR-2 and maintained in ND-96 solution (96 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1.8 mmCaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 2.5 mm sodium pyruvate, 5 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.5) until injection of ∼40 ng of mRNA. After this time they were maintained in ND-96, pH 8.5, in order to minimize the proton flux due to the action of the M2 ion channel. All solutions were equilibrated with room air except for solutions containing Cu(I), which were equilibrated with N2. In control experiments we found that the currents of oocytes expressing the M2 protein incubated in Barth's solution equilibrated with N2 (pH 7.5 or pH 6.2) for up to 20 min were indistinguishable from those of oocytes incubated at the same pH in Barth's solution equilibrated with room air. Metabolic labeling of oocytes and analysis of proteins by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was carried out as described previously (15Tu Q. Pinto L.H. Luo G. Shaughnessy M.A. Mullaney D. Kurtz S. Krystal M. Lamb R.A. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 4246-4252Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). 24–48 h after RNA injection, whole-cell currents were recorded with a two-electrode voltage-clamp apparatus consisting of a differential preamplifier (Nihon Kohden MEZ-7101, Tokyo, Japan) that recorded the voltage difference between a pipette (filled with 3 m KCl) located in the cell and another in the surrounding bath. A voltage-clamp amplifier (Nihon Kohden CEZ-1100) provided feedback current to the oocyte through a second intracellular pipette. Oocyte currents were recorded in standard Barth's solution (0.3 mmNaNO3, 0.71 mm CaCl2, 0.82 mm MgSO4, 1.0 mm KCl, 2.4 mm NaHCO3, 88 mm NaCl, 15.0 mm MES,1 pH 6.2, or 15.0 mm HEPES, pH 7.5) or a modified Barth's solution as indicated. Amantadine hydrochloride (Sigma) (10 mm stock in Barth's solution), CuCl2, and BL-1743 (kindly provided by Dr. Mark Krystal, Squibb, Wallingford, CT) were diluted as indicated. To check that the oocytes did not develop nonspecific leakage currents during the recordings, we applied amantadine hydrochloride (100 μm) for 2–5 min at the end of the measurements from each oocyte. Data from an oocyte were only used if the current in the presence of amantadine was less than 10% of the initial current. CdCl2, MgCl2, PtCl2(NH4)2, and ZnCl2were purchased from Sigma; CuCl2 and Cu(I) tetrakis(acetonitrile)hexafluorophosphate were purchased from Aldrich; MnCl2 was purchased from J. T. Baker Inc., and AgNO3 was purchased from Fisher. Cu2+is a potent, time-dependent inhibitor of the channel activity of oocytes that express the M2 protein (Fig. 2 and TableI). In the absence of M2 protein, Xenopusoocytes have very small currents in the range of pH 4.0-pH 9.0. Oocytes that express M2 protein have currents that are dependent on pH of the bathing medium (14Pinto L.H. Holsinger L.J. Lamb R.A. Cell. 1992; 69: 517-528Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (995) Google Scholar, 25Wang C. Lamb R.A. Pinto L.H. Biophys. J. 1995; 69: 1363-1371Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). For pH 7.5 the current is double the background current found in control oocytes. However, at pH 6.2 the current is about 8-fold higher than the current at pH 7.5 (14Pinto L.H. Holsinger L.J. Lamb R.A. Cell. 1992; 69: 517-528Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (995) Google Scholar, 25Wang C. Lamb R.A. Pinto L.H. Biophys. J. 1995; 69: 1363-1371Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Bathing oocytes that express wild-type M2 protein in a solution that contains 100 μm amantadine causes the currents to decrease to background levels within 2–3 min (14Pinto L.H. Holsinger L.J. Lamb R.A. Cell. 1992; 69: 517-528Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (995) Google Scholar, 16Wang C. Takeuchi K. Pinto L.H. Lamb R.A. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 5585-5594Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Prolonged exposure of oocytes to Cu2+ can be toxic, so we took a number of precautions to ensure that the observed inhibition was specific to the M2 ion channel. Before applying media containing transition metals, we first confirmed that the whole-cell current of each oocyte was activated by low pHout. We also tested each cell for the inhibition of current by amantadine by applying the drug after washing out the transition metal. The data reported here are from oocytes whose currents were increased 4–6-fold by decreasing pHout from pH 7.5 to pH 6.2 and whose currents were reduced to 100–200 nA by amantadine (100 μm for 2 min). These values for activation by low pH and inhibition by amantadine are within the range for M2-expressing oocytes in the absence of transition metals and thus provide assurance that the inhibition reported is specific to the M2 ion channel and is not confounded with nonspecific leakage currents.Table IParameters fitted to the time course of inhibition of the wild-type M2 ion channel protein by Cu2+ (see Fig. 2)Parameter0.1 mm (●)0.5 mm (■)1.0 mm (▴)Ilim0.11 ± 0.010.14 ± 0.010.14 ± 0.01αf0.48 ± 0.020.46 ± 0.020.25 ± 0.0K fast(Global)93 ± 5 m s−1K slow (Global)18.6 ± 0.9 m s−1 Open table in a new tab Addition of Cu2+ to the bathing solution (pHout= 6.2) gives rise to a time-dependent decrease in the amantadine-sensitive channel activity, approaching full inhibition at long times (Fig. 2 and Table I). The time course of inhibition differs from that for amantadine or other hydrophobic drugs, which generally show simple, pseudo-order first order decay kinetics under conditions where the drugs are in large excess. Instead, the data for inhibition by Cu2+ is biphasic, and the data can be fit by a sum of two exponentials (Fig. 2 and Table I), representing a fast and a slow process with both relaxation times linearly proportional to the concentration of Cu2+ between 100 and 1000 μm. Indeed, we show below that the initial rapid rate (93 ± 5 m−1 s−1) is associated with a nonspecific, partial block of the channel that is not dependent on His-37, whereas the slower process (18.6 ± 0.9m−1 s−1) requires the presence of histidine at position 37. The second order rate constant associated with this latter process is nearly 2 orders of magnitude slower than the value observed for inhibition of the M2 channel activity (A/Udorn subtype) by amantadine. Fig. 3 and Table II illustrate the recovery of the amantadine-sensitive channel activity following removal of Cu2+. Again, the data can be fit by two exponentials. Interestingly, the curves show a small initial burst, possibly reflecting dissociation from the low affinity site, followed by a slow recovery of channel activity representing dissociation from the high affinity site. Indeed, the fraction of the fast component of the recovery kinetics decreased with time of preincubation with Cu2+ and was essentially unmeasurable after the long (over 20 min) incubation period with 100 μm Cu2+(see Fig. 3 legend and Table II). The slow dissociation rate constant (1.8 × 10−4 s−1) corresponds to a half-life of approximately 2 h for copper bound to the high affinity site. The dissociation constant for binding of Cu2+ to the low affinity site of M2 can be estimated to be approximately 100 μm from the ratio of the fast process on and off rate constants, assuming that these are kinetically independent (mechanistic analysis from Appendix A yields 400 μm or 250 μm, depending on the mechanism chosen). The corresponding dissociation constant for the high affinity site (using the ratio of slow off to fast on rate constants) would be about 2 μm (Appendix A yields 1.9 or 1.6 μm), significantly tighter.Table IIParameters fitted to the time course after exposure to Cu2+(see Fig. 3)Parameter0.1 mm (●)0.5 mm (■)1.0 mm(▴)Iinf0.52 ± 0.250.42 ± 170.543Io0.059 ± 0.0050.049 ± 0.0050.054 ± 0.005αf7.6 × 10−60.46 ± 0.020.72k fast (Global)89 ± 0.0002 s−1k slow (Global)1.84 ± 1 × 10−4 s−1Values represent means ± S.D.; in three cases the standard deviation could not be calculated.

To help identify the nature of the binding sites, we first determined if they could be titrated within the range of pH we were able to test. This titration was done by measuring the time course of inhibition and recovery from inhibition in solutions of various pH values. These experiments paralleled previous experiments in which we showed that amantadine binds less strongly at low pH, and we showed that the pH dependence of the interaction required the presence of His-37. Similarly, the time course of inhibition was slower at acidic pH (Fig.4), and the recovery was faster for the lower values of pH. We were able to test only the effects of pH in the range pH 5.2–6.2. Below pH 5.2 irreversible effects due to large proton currents flowing for many seconds were seen, and above pH 6.2 the current amplitude was too small to measure inhibition directly. If the Cu2+-binding sites lie within the transmembrane region, then the rate of association of the positively charged copper ion may be accelerated at negative applied potentials. To test this possibility we measured the time course of inhibition by 250 μmCu2+ at various holding voltages. We found that the rate of onset of inhibition was greater for more negative holding voltages (Fig. 5 and Table III), consistent with the presence of at least one Cu2+-binding site that is located at least partially inside the electric field of the membrane.Table IIIParameters fitted to the time course of onset of inhibition and recovery from inhibition by 0.25 mm Cu2+ for membrane voltages between −40 and +40 mV (see Fig. 5)Parameter(●) −40 mV(■) −20 mV(▴), 0 mV(▾) +20 mV(⧫) +40 mVkff (ms)−1112.394.937.6201.043.0k fs (ms)−116.711.314.29.3711.9102 k bf(s−1)51.80.3880.712.8Unmeas.aUnmeasured.102 kbs(s−1)0.310.3860.0840.076Unmeas.a Unmeasured. Open table in a new tab Cationic, open-pore blocker molecules usually attenuate only the current originating from the side of the membrane to which they are applied. An example of this is the block of the outward, but not inward, K+ current of the squid axon by internally applied tetraethylammonium+ cation (28Armstrong C.M. Binstock L. J. Gen. Physiol. 1965; 48: 859-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). We tested the directionality of the inhibition by Cu2+ by measuring the current-voltage relationship of the oocyte (pHout = 6.2) with slowly varying ramps of current before and at various times after the application of Cu2+. For these experiments, the leakage current in the presence of amantadine was subtracted in order to obtain an accurate estimate of the reversal potential, and the membrane voltage was restricted to +50 mV to avoid activating endogenous channels. We found (in six cells) that inward and outward currents were attenuated equally (see Fig. 6) and that the reversal voltage remained constant with increasing percentage inhibition by Cu2+. Thus, inhibition by Cu2+, like inhibition by amantadine (see Fig. 6, inset), is bi-directional. If Cu2+ binds to an internal site, it should be possible to block binding by prior application of a compound that either competes for the same site or occupies the outer regions of the pore. The compound BL-1743 has been shown to be a reversible inhibitor of the currents of the M2 ion channel (15Tu Q. Pinto L.H. Luo G. Shaughnessy M.A. Mullaney D. Kurtz S. Krystal M. Lamb R.A. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 4246-4252Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mutations conferring resistance to BL-1743 map to the pore region immediately above His-37 (as viewed in Fig. 1), suggesting that BL-1743 penetrates deeply into the pore. We tested the ability of BL-1743 to prevent inhibition by Cu2+. The test depended on the fact that recovery from inhibition by BL-1743 (Fig. 7 and Ref.15Tu Q. Pinto L.H. Luo G. Shaughnessy M.A. Mullaney D. Kurtz S. Krystal M. Lamb R.A. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 4246-4252Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) is considerably faster than that from 0.5 mmCu2+ (4 min versus 4 h, respectively). To determine whether BL-1743 prevents inhibition by Cu2+, we performed the following steps: (i) inhibited the channel completely with BL-1743; (ii) while maintaining the concentration of BL-1743 constant, added 0.5 mm Cu2+ to the solution for 5 min (such that the Cu2+ would have completely inhibited the currents had it been applied alone); (iii) washed out free Cu2+ from the recording chamber briefly (2 min) while BL-1743 was still maintained in the solution; (iv) washed out BL-1743 and measured the time course of recovery. Our earlier results demonstrated that the time course of recovery from inhibition by Cu2+ alone is much slower than that from BL-1743. Thus, if Cu2+ had gained access to an internal binding site in the presence of BL-1743, then during washout of BL-1743 the recovery would have been slow and incomplete. However, we found that the time course of the recovery during washout of BL-1743 did not differ from the time course that would have been measured had Cu2+ not been applied (Fig. 7). Thus, BL-1743 prevented the binding of Cu2+ to a presumably internal site. The above results strongly suggest that the high affinity Cu2+-binding site lies within the transmembrane pore of M2. To confirm these observations, we examined the ability of Cu2+ to inhibit a number of variants of M2 in which potential chelating groups were altered. The amino acid sequence of the transmembrane region of M2 (residues 24–43) is: Asp-Pro-Leu-Val-Val-Ala-Ala-Ser-Ile-Ile-Gly-Ile-Leu-His-Leu-Ile-Leu-Trp-Ile-Leu. The only titratable residue in the transmembrane region is His-37, and this residue has been shown to be important for amantadine inhibition. Thus, we compared the ability of Cu2+ to inhibit the mutant proteins M2-H37A and M2-H37G with its ability to inhibit the wild-type M2 protein. In addition, we examined the role of the Asp-24, which lies near the N terminus of the α-helix, and Ser-31, which lines a portion of the predicted pore. Finally, wild-type M2 protein has two cysteine residues at positions 17 and 19 in the extracellular domain. It appeared unlikely that they would be responsible for binding Cu2+ because these residues participate in disulfide bonding to stabilize the homotetramer (4Sugrue R.J. Hay A.J. Virology. 1991; 180: 617-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar, 5Panayotov P.P. Schlesinger R.W. Virology. 1992; 186: 352-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 6Holsinger L.J. Lamb R.A. Virology. 1991; 183: 32-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, we tested for this possibility by using a previously characterized “cysteineless” mutant in which each of the three cysteine residues of the M2 protein, found at positions 17, 19, and 50, were mutated to serine. We examined the time course of inhibition and recovery from inhibition of the currents of the M2-H37A and M2-H37G mutant proteins by 0.1 and 1.0 mm Cu2+. The limiting fractional inhibition was less than for the wild-type protein, and the rates of inhibition and recovery for both of these mutant proteins were faster than for the wild-type M2 protein (Fig. 8 and TableIV). Unlike the data for the wild-type protein, that for both mutants could be"

Despite the importance of this region to CFTR function, an understanding of the pore and MSD structure is limited. Studies of the effect of cystic fibrosis (CF)-associated mutations have been of value in identifying structurally and functionally important regions of CFTR. At least four CF-associated mutations have been identified at position 347 in M6: R347C, R347H, R347L, and R347P, suggesting that Arg-347 is important for CFTR structure and function (13Dean M.

Nature. 1993; 362: 160-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar) showed that mutation of Arg-347 to proline significantly decreased single-channel conductance with little effect on CFTR trafficking to the plasma membrane. Other work by Tabcharani et al. (8Tabcharani J.A. Rommens J.M. Hou Y.-X. Chang X.-B. Tsui L.-C. Riordan J.R. Hanrahan J.W.

(Lond .). 1996; 496: 687-693Crossref Scopus (117) Google Scholar) emphasized the importance of Arg-347 for anomalous mole-fraction behavior, iodide permeability, and voltage-dependent block by DIDS, in addition to single-channel conductance. Interestingly, mutation of Arg-347 to a histidine (R347H) produced a channel that displayed pH-dependent conductance and anomalous mole-fraction behavior (8Tabcharani J.A. Rommens J.M. Hou Y.-X. Chang X.-B. Tsui L.-C. Riordan J.R. Hanrahan J.W. Nature. 1993; 366: 79-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). These studies suggested that Arg-347 may line the pore and that a positive charge at position 347 is sufficient for wild-type conductance. Because mutation of Arg-347 eliminated anomalous mole-fraction behavior, Arg-347 itself was proposed to be an anion binding site in the CFTR pore (8Tabcharani J.A. Rommens J.M. Hou Y.-X. Chang X.-B. Tsui L.-C. Riordan J.R. Hanrahan J.W. Nature. 1993; 366: 79-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar), and the presumed positive charge introduced upon protonation of His-347 was thought to facilitate interactions with permeating anions. An alternative interpretation is that Arg-347 may be important for maintenance of pore architecture without contributing directly to the permeation pathway. For example, mutation of this site could lead to a change in MSD conformation and loss of an anion-binding site(s) elsewhere; protonation of His-347 might then rescue the conformation of the R347H mutant. As discussed by Perutz (18Perutz M.F. Science. 1978; 201: 1187-1191Crossref PubMed Scopus (645) Google Scholar), charged residues within proteins reside in locations where they are either solvated or can interact with and be neutralized by oppositely charged residues. These electrostatic interactions mediate an important stabilizing effect, providing increased thermostability and resistance to denaturation. Based on these considerations, it is possible that Arg-347 may line the pore where it can interact with either water or permeant anions. However, it is also possible that Arg-347 may mediate a structural role in the MSDs; there are a number of negatively charged residues with which Arg-347 might interact. Both possibilities are consistent with the present data. To better understand the role of Arg-347 in CFTR structure and function, we examined the effect of mutating Arg-347 to cysteine, aspartic acid, glutamic acid, lysine, and leucine on CFTR conductance. We examined the cytosolic pH (pHc)-dependent behavior of CFTR-R347H and that of the other residue 347 mutants both with (R347C, R347D, R347E, and R347K) and without (R347L) a pHc-titratable residue. The conductance of CFTR-R347H is pHc-dependent. Because the site of protonation may exist in one of two states, either protonated or deprotonated, we tested the hypothesis that CFTR-R347H may display two pHc-dependent conductance states, which it did. If the protonatable site lines the pore, then the two ionization states of the protonatable residue might yield two distinct conductance states. Alternatively, if the protonatable site influences structure, then the two conductance states might represent two distinct conformational states of CFTR. Moreover, like CFTR-R347H, all the other residue 347 mutants, except R347K, displayed two pHc-dependent conductance states over a similar pHc range. The residue at position 347 did not influence current flow through either conductance state. These data suggested that residue 347 probably does not line the pore but likely stabilizes CFTR structure. To pursue this, we studied the effect of mutating residues elsewhere in the MSDs that might interact with Arg-347. All mutants were constructed in the pTM1-CFTR4 plasmid by the method of Kunkel (19Kunkel T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 488-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (4880) Google Scholar). The mutagenesis was confirmed by restriction digestion of silently introduced restriction sites and by sequencing around the introduced mutation site. In vitro transcription and translation of each mutant was performed to confirm expression of full-length protein. Wild-type and mutant channels were expressed transiently in HeLa cells using the vaccinia virus/T7 bacteriophage hybrid expression system as described previously (20Anderson M.P. Welsh M.J. Science. 1992; 257: 1701-1704Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Cells were routinely studied 12 to 24 h after infection-transfection. Methods used for excised, inside-out patch clamp recordings were as described previously (21Hamill O.P. Marty A. Neher E. Sakmann B. Sigworth F.J. Pflugers Arch. 1981; 391: 85-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (15066) Google Scholar, 22Sheppard D.N. Ostedgaard L.S. Winter M.C. Welsh M.J.

Voltages were referenced to the extracellular side of the membrane. All studies were done at room temperature (22–24 °C) to facilitate kinetic analysis. The membrane potential was clamped at −120 mV unless otherwise indicated. CFTR was activated by excising patches into a bath solution (pHc 7.3; Tricine or TES) containing 1 mm ATP and 75 nm catalytic subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (Promega Corp., Madison, WI). During the pHcstudies, cAMP-dependent protein kinase was removed, and bath (cytosolic side) ATP concentration was adjusted (usually to less than 0.05 mm ATP) to resolve single-channel bursting activity within multichannel macropatches. For experiments with excised, inside-out patches, the pipette (extracellular) solution contained (in mm): 140N-methyl-d-glucamine (NMDG), 140 aspartic acid, 10 Bis-Tris, 5 CaCl2, 2 MgSO4, pHo 6. The bath (intracellular) solution contained (in mm): 140 NMDG, 10 Bis-Tris, 3 MgCl2, 4 CsOH/1 EGTA, pHc 6.5 (unless indicated) with HCl ([Ca2+]free < 10−8). We selected Bis-Tris as a buffer to avoid the blocking effect that Good's type buffers such as MOPS have on CFTR (24Ishihara H. Welsh M.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: C1278-C1289Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). pH was adjusted at room temperature (22–24 °C) using a Model 10 Accumet meter fitted with a gel-filled combination electrode calibrated with pH 6.0 or 7.0 standardized buffer solutions, where appropriate (all pH analytical equipment was from Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA). Single-channel current amplitudes were determined from the peaks in all-points histograms. Single-channel conductances were derived from the slope of the single-channel linear I-V relationship. Single-channel data were filtered at 1000 Hz using an 8-pole Bessel filter (902LPF, Frequency Devices, Haverhill, MA), digitized at 5000 Hz, and digitally filtered at 500 Hz. The resolution of the A/D converter was 0.0012 pA. Events lists were generated using a half-height transition protocol; transitions less than 1 ms were excluded. For events list generation, a prompt was positioned by eye at each current level representing the closed state, the little conductance state (OL), and the big conductance state (OB). The lifetimes of individual sojourns in OL or OB were collected, binned (10 bins per decade), and fitted with a one-component exponential using the maximum likelihood method. Wild-type CFTR enters a short-lived intraburst closed state; for simplicity we omitted this state in our analysis of residue 347 mutants since it is rare in wild-type CFTR in the absence of MOPS or other blocking buffers (approximately once every 213 ms within bursts of duration equalling 649 ms; n = 2 at pHc 6.0, −120 mV, 22–24 °C) on the time-scale of transitions between the OL and OB state (24Ishihara H. Welsh M.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: C1278-C1289Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Single-channel current variance analysis was done as described in the legend for Fig. 3 and in Ref. 25Root M.J. MacKinnon R. Science. 1994; 265: 1852-1856Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar. Data acquisition and analysis were done using the pClamp software package (Axon Instruments Inc., Foster City, CA) and Excel 5.0 (Microsoft Corp., Redmond, WA). To determine whether R347H exhibits two discrete conductance states, we studied single channels in excised, inside-out patches. Fig. 1 shows a representative single-channel trace from R347H displaying two pHc-dependent conductance states, OLand OB. Unexpectedly, all the other variants at residue 347, except R347K, showed two pHc-dependent conductance states over a similar pH range. Even R347L, which does not have a titratable side chain, displayed this behavior (Fig. 1). The conservative substitution of Arg-347 by Lys (R347K) showed only a single conductance state and no pHc dependence. Similar results were observed when NMDG-Cl was replaced with NaCl or when Bis-Tris was replaced with MES (n = 2 each, not shown), suggesting that this behavior is not due to block by a pHc-dependent change in one of the pH-titratable bath reagents, NMDG or Bis-Tris. The pH of the pipette solution did influence the results (not shown). Also, there was no state-dependent bias in opening or closing. Channels opened into or closed from the OL or OB states as predicted based solely upon pHc. The all-points histograms (Fig. 1) illustrate qualitatively that as pHc increased, each mutant except R347K spent an increased fraction of time in OL and a correspondingly decreased fraction of time in OB. Points in the histogram from the zero current state (C), which are largely a function of ATP concentration (26Winter M.C. Sheppard D.N. Carson M.R. Welsh M.J. Biophys.

Wild-type CFTR and R347K possess only one predominant conductance state over the pHc range 5.5–7.3 (Fig. 1, data not shown, and Ref.8Tabcharani J.A. Rommens J.M. Hou Y.-X. Chang X.-B. Tsui L.-C. Riordan J.R. Hanrahan J.W. Nature. 1993; 366: 79-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). This result suggests that a large positively charged residue at position 347 (Arg or Lys) in CFTR stabilizes the OB state relative to the OL state. Visual inspection suggested that the lifetimes of OL and OB states were also influenced by the nature of the residue at position 347: R347E and R347H tended to have longer dwell times in the OL and OB states, whereas R347L, R347C, and R347D tended to display shorter dwell times. In general, the smaller the residue, the more rapid the kinetics. Perhaps steric hindrance imposed by the residue at position 347 might explain the size dependence of the kinetics. For R347D, the lifetime in the OB state was so short that a discrete OB was not apparent on the all-points histogram; instead, as pHc decreased, a shoulder developed on the OL state distribution in the all-points histogram (Fig.1). Since R347L displayed two pHc-dependent conductance states and since leucine is aliphatic and non-ionizable, the pHc dependence of residue 347 mutants cannot be attributed simply to protonation of residue 347. To determine whether the residue at position 347 affects single-channel conductance and not merely the conductance state of the channel, we examined the I-V relationship and slope conductance of the mutants with slower pHc-dependent kinetics, R347H and R347E, as well as R347K. Filtering obscured the true current amplitudes of the other pHc-dependent mutants with more rapid kinetics. Fig. 2 shows that the I-V relationships and slope conductances for the OL and OB states were not significantly affected by the nature of the residue at position 347. The single-channel conductance at pHc 6.0 of wild-type CFTR, R347K, and the OB state of R347E and R347H were all very similar (in pS): 7.7 ± 0.4, 8.3 ± 0.6, 7.4 ± 0.4, and 6.9 ± 0.2, respectively (n = 3 for each). The single-channel conductance of the OL states of R347E and R347H at pHc 6.0 were also very similar (in pS): 1.5 ± 0.1 and 1.6 ± 0.1, respectively (n = 3 and 4 for each). These data suggest that the amino acid at residue 347 does not affect single-channel current amplitude, rather the predominant effect is on the lifetime of the OL and OB conductance states. The lack of effect of the specific residue at position 347 on the rate of Cl− flow through the pore in either the OL or OB conductance state suggests that residue 347 does not interact directly with permeating anions. There are at least two possible explanations for the pHc-dependent behavior of residue 347 mutants. One explanation is that mutations at residue 347 reveal the effect of a protonatable residue in the permeation path that directly interacts with anions. In this case, the lifetime of the OB and OL state represent the lifetime of the protonated and deprotonated ionization states of this unknown site, respectively. A second explanation is that when Arg-347 is mutated, the membrane-spanning domains that form the pore fluctuate between two conformational states, OL and OB; protonation or deprotonation of some unknown site favors the OB or OL conformational states, respectively. The first explanation seems unlikely because the reciprocal lifetime of the OL state which represents the “on” rate for the proton is very slow (e.g. it is 6 × 107m−1 s−1 for R347E). This rate is ∼200-fold slower than proton transfer onto an imidazole in free solution (29Lu Z. MacKinnon R. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13133-13138Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 30Eigen M. Hammes G.G. Kustin K. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1960; 82: 3482-3483Crossref Scopus (59) Google Scholar) and ∼10-fold slower than transfer onto an imidazole in the pore of ROMK1 (25Root M.J. MacKinnon R. Science. 1994; 265: 1852-1856Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). The slow rate, however, might be explained in part by residence of the protonatable site in a sterically and electrostatically shielded position. In addition, the site of protonation revealed by a residue 347 mutation would have to perfectly replace the lost anion-binding site incurred through the mutagenesis; this seems exceedingly fortuitous. This consideration convinced us to favor a model involving a conformational change in CFTR. We performed a dwell-time analysis of the lifetimes of the OL and OB states of R347E and R347H to enable more quantitative comparisons between them and to better understand their pHc dependence. Both OL and OBdwell-time histograms were best fit by a single exponential function at all pHc values examined. This suggests that the distribution between OL and OB state does not change markedly throughout the gating cycle; this can also be observed visually in Fig. 1. Fig. 3 Ashows that the reciprocal lifetime of the OL state increased relatively linearly with increasing proton concentration. This indicates that the rate of entry into the OB state increased with increasing proton concentration. This linear, first order dependence on proton concentration suggests that protonation of only a single site limits the rate of movement from the OLto the OB state. The rate of exit from the OBstate decreased non-linearly with increasing proton concentrations. The kinetics and the equilibria between OL and OBwere very similar for both mutants (Fig. 3 A). The observable pK (0 mV) for the equilibrium between OL and OB of R347E and R347H were 6.4 and 6.3, respectively. The faster kinetics of R347D, R347C, and R347L made dwell-time analysis for these mutants less reliable. Therefore, to obtain an estimate of the approximate pK of these mutants, we examined changes in the variance of the open-state current with changes in pHc (25Root M.J. MacKinnon R. Science. 1994; 265: 1852-1856Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). The current variance should go through a maximum when the pHcequals the observable pK. Each mutant displayed an increase in current variance with increasing proton concentration (i.e. decreasing pH). Fig. 3B shows that R347C, R347D, and R347L did not reach a peak variance over the range of pHcstudied, suggesting that their apparent pK is less than 5.0–5.5. Visual inspection of the tracings suggested that the mutants were largely in their OL state over the range of pHc employed such that we did not miss a peak in the variance. In this analysis, we assumed that the mutants would display minimal pH-independent movement between OL and OBstates at very acidic pHc so that the variance should pass through a maximum as pHc decreases. As a control for the variance analysis, we examined the R347E mutant on which we had also done dwell-time analysis (Fig. 3 A); as expected, Fig.3 B shows that the variance of R347E goes through a maximum between pHc 6.5 and 5.5. To learn more about the nature of the two conductance states of residue 347 mutants, we examined the voltage dependence of the OLand OB lifetimes. Fig.4 A shows qualitatively that both conductance states of R347E were voltage-dependent. Fig. 4 B shows quantitatively that at pHc 6.0 the OL and OB states for R347E and R347H were both influenced by the transmembrane voltage. The voltage dependence may derive from alterations in the distribution of protons near the protonatable site or from charged regions of CFTR moving through the voltage field. We assumed the Boltzman distribution to quantify the effect of voltage on the equilibrium between OL and OB states such that pK(mV)=pK(0mV)+θzFE/2.303RTEquation 1 in which θ = electrical distance from the cytosolic surface,z = valence, F = Faraday's constant,E = transmembrane potential, r = gas constant, T = temperature, pK = the negative log of the equilibrium constant between OL and OB conformations. The degree of voltage dependence was similar for both mutants despite the charge differences at residue 347 and yielded a θz of 0.25 and 0.21 for R347E and R347H, respectively. The voltage dependence was asymmetrically disposed between the rate of entry into the OB state and the rate of exit from OB (Fig. 4 B). To quantify these differences we used the following: τL−1(mV)=τL−1(0mV)·exp[(1−δ)θzFE/RT]Equation 2 τB−1(mV)=τB−1(0mV)·exp[(−δ)θzFE/RT]Equation 3 in which δ = symmetry factor which partitions voltage dependence (31Läuger P. Electogenic Ion Pumps. 5 Ed. SinauerAssociates, Inc., Sunderland, MA1991Google Scholar, 32Gadsby D.C. Rakowski R.F. DeWeer P. Science. 1993; 260: 100-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). The rate of exit from the OB state (τB−1) was more voltage-dependent than the rate of exit from the OL state (τL−1) for both mutants (δ = 0.8 versus 1 − δ = 0.2 for R347E and δ = 0.7 versus 1 − δ = 0.3 for R347H). This observation may be explained by the protonatable site moving through the voltage field; protonation and deprotonation of this site before and after the conformational change will affect the net charge migrating through the applied voltage. Since voltage dependence arises from charge movement through a voltage field and since R347E and R347H displayed similar voltage dependences and carry different charges at position 347, residue 347 is not likely moving through a transmembrane potential during interchange between OL and OBstates. The data suggest that Arg-347 and Lys-347 may stabilize the structure of the pore; in their absence, the channel “flickers” between two conductance states. Arginine and lysine residues through electrostatic interactions with anionic residues are important for the structure of membrane-spanning domains in other proteins such as the Lac permease and the inward-rectified K+ channel, IRK1 (33King S.C. Hansen C.L. Wilson T.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1062: 177-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 34Sahin-Toth M. Dunten R.L. Gonzalez A. Kaback H.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

As discussed by Perutz (18Perutz M.F. Science. 1978; 201: 1187-1191Crossref PubMed Scopus (645) Google Scholar), salt bridges within proteins are an important structural feature that confers thermostability and resistance to denaturation. We hypothesized that Arg-347 may mediate a stabilizing influence by contributing to a salt bridge within the MSDs. There are multiple glutamates and aspartates within transmembrane (M) regions with which Arg-347 or Lys-347 might interact: Glu-92 (M1), Glu-873 (M7), Asp-924 (M8), Asp-993 (M9), and Glu-1104 (M11). To identify the Arg-347 interaction partner, we replaced Arg-347 with an anionic residue (R347E or R347D) and introduced an arginine residue in the place of candidate partners in a salt bridge. We studied the conductance properties of the following double mutants: R347D/D924R, R347D/D993R, and R347E/E1104R. The R347D/D993R and R347E/E1104R mutants each had two conductance states with pHc-dependent behavior (Fig. 5). For R347D/D993R the increased entry into the OB state was apparent as a shoulder on the amplitude histogram at pHc 5.5. Accordingly, for R347D/D993R and R347E/E1104R the current variance in the open state increased with decreasing pHc (Fig. 5 B). Qualitatively, the lifetimes of the OL and OBconductance states in the R347D/D993R and R347E/E1104R were similar to that of the R347D and R347E mutants, respectively. The amplitude of the OL state was larger for both of these double mutants as compared with the single mutants (Figs. 1 B and5 B). We also observed an infrequent, additional small conductance state in the R347E/E1104 mutant (see amplitude histogram in Fig. 5 A); this is likely due to the E1104R mutation itself. In contrast to the other double mutants, the R347D/D924R mutant did not display the pHc-dependent flicker found in the R347D single mutant (Fig. 5, A and B), and there was no effect of pH on open-channel variance (Fig. 5 B). The single-channel conductance was similar to that of wild-type CFTR (6.1 ± 0.1 pS; n = 3; Fig. 2). These data suggest that the D924R mutation compensates for or rescues the phenotype of the R347D mutation. This result predicts that the D924R mutation alone (with Arg at position 347) would generate an unstable channel with at least two open conductance states. Fig. 6shows that the D924R single mutant displayed multiple (∼3) conductance states that appeared to be pHc-independent. Previous work from our and Hanrahan's laboratories (7Sheppard D.N. Rich D.P. Ostedgaard L.S. Gregory R.J. Smith A.E. Welsh M.J. Nature. 1993; 362: 160-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar, 8Tabcharani J.A. Rommens J.M. Hou Y.-X. Chang X.-B. Tsui L.-C. Riordan J.R. Hanrahan J.W. Nature. 1993; 366: 79-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 17Linsdell P. Hanrahan J.W. J. Physiol. (Lond .). 1996; 496: 687-693Crossref Scopus (117) Google Scholar) has led to the speculation that Arg-347 may be an anion-binding site in the CFTR pore. However in contrast to earlier interpretations, our current data show that residue 347 does not influence permeation properties via a direct interaction with permeating anions. Instead they suggest that Arg-347 may be more important for maintenance of pore architecture. We found that mutation of residue 347 to glutamate, aspartate, cysteine, histidine, or leucine all produced channels with two distinct conductance states, OL and OB. pHc, and voltage influenced the movement between these two states over a similar range for all mutants. Additionally, the single-channel slope conductances of R347H and R347E were the same in both OBand OL states. The OB state for each had the same conductance as wild-type CFTR. The average calculated pK a for a glutamate and a histidine within a protein are 4.0 and 6.9 (36Antosiewicz J. McCammon J.A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 7819-7833Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar), respectively. If His-347 or Glu-347 line the permeation pathway, at pHc 6.0 (bath solution) or pHo6.5 (pipette solution) His-347 is predicted to be protonated and to have at least a partial positive charge, and Glu-347 should be fully deprotonated and have a negative charge. Since the charge or the structure of the residue at position 347 failed to affect single-channel conductance, it seems unlikely to be either an anion-binding site or to be positioned such that it interacts sterically or electrostatically with permeating anions. Thus, mutation of Arg-347 may decrease single-channel conductance and anomalous mole-fraction behavior by disrupting pore architecture and the function of some other anion-binding site(s). All the mutants except R347K showed two pH-dependent conductance states. The equilibria between OB and OL states were similar despite the nature of the mutation at residue 347 with values of pK ranging from ∼5–7. 3The shift toward a lower pK for mutants with more rapid kinetics (Fig. 1 and 3 B) may be a filtering artifact; from analysis of the R347E mutant and the R347H mutant, we know that the OB state tends to be shorter then the OL state at the applied transmembrane voltage and is therefore more vulnerable to filtering. We presume that this relationship is preserved throughout all the mutants. Because the values of pK were roughly similar, the data suggest that the structure, titratability, and pK of residue 347 do not markedly influence the distribution between OL and OB states. The linear dependence on proton concentration for OB entry suggests that a single protonatable site largely determines entry into this state. The OB and OL states may represent two protonation states of the CFTR molecule or two distinct conformational states that are influenced by protonation. For the reasons discussed above, we favor the latter possibility, that alternating residence in two discrete conformations is responsible for the two conductance states. How might this occur? We hypothesize that Arg-347 forms a salt bridge with another negatively charged residue in CFTR. Mutation of Arg-347 would leave a negatively charged residue unpaired within the membrane. Charged molecules within a low dielectric constant are unstable (37Hille B. Ionic Channels in Excitable Membranes. Sinauer Associates, Inc., Sunderland, MA1992Google Scholar). Therefore, the protein might reorient to solvate the charge, i.e. enter the OL state. Subsequent protonation of that site would neutralize its charge and allow the protein to reorient back to its native conformation, i.e.return to the OB state. This model suggests that the residue(s) with which Arg-347 interacts may be the protonatable site. Several observations are consistent with this hypothesis. First, we found that a positively charged lysine, which can support a salt bridge, was able to supplant arginine. However, the other residues tested were not able to substitute for arginine. Perhaps histidine was not able to replace arginine because its side chain was not long enough or it may have an anomalously acidic pK a within the low dielectric constant of the membrane. Second, and more importantly, we found that a second-site complementary mutation at position 924 (D924R) largely eliminated the pHc-dependent flickering phenotype of the R347D mutation and restored current amplitude to near wild-type values. We also recognize the possibility that Arg-347 may interact with additional yet untested residues, e.g. Glu-873 in M7. Third, a salt bridge between Arg-347 and Asp-924 should be disrupted by mutation of Asp-924. As predicted, we found that the D924R mutant displayed erratic flickery, pHc-independent behavior. Presumably, this mutation also generates an unstable channel. The pHc independence of D924R is also consistent with the hypothesis that Asp-924 is the site of protonation in the residue 347 mutants. Interestingly, mutation of a glutamate in the putative salt bridge in the P-loop of the IRK1 channel leads to a single-channel flickering phenotype reminiscent of residue 347 mutations (35Yang J. Yu M. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1568-1572Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). At the simplest level, the data suggest that both MSDs functionally interact in a manner that influences permeation. The studies of R347D/D924R are consistent with a salt bridge between Arg-347 and Asp-924 and thus an interaction between M6 and M8. This further suggests that mutations in MSD2 may alter the phenotype of mutations in MSD1. Consistent with this, mutation of D993R and E1104R in MSD2 increased the relative amplitude of the OL conductance state in the context of Arg-347 mutations. The Arg-347 residue is targeted by several CF-associated mutations, R347C, R347H, R347L, and R347P (13Dean M. White M.B. Amos J. Gerrard B. Stewart C. Khaw K.T. Leppert M.

They disrupt pore architecture by disrupting an interaction between Arg-347 and another residue(s), one possibly being Asp-924 in M8. These data highlight the importance of residue 347 for CFTR function and may explain in part why this residue is targeted by multiple CF-associated mutations.

However, the biochemical mechanism by which posttranslational modification is associated with the modulation of gap junction channels remains obscure. It has been suggested that mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase plays an important role in the loss of GJC during mitotic division (31Warn-Cramer B.J. Cottrell G.T. Burt J.M. Lau A.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9188-9196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). Therefore, we sought to determine whether MAP kinase is directly involved in the gating mechanism of gap junction channels. Detailed studies of GJC have been severely constrained by the fact that gap junction channels are not exposed to the extracellular space, and access to the channels is only available via the cytoplasm or dialyzed cytoplasm in a whole-cell patch clamp configuration. Thus, it is difficult to correlate unequivocally the effects of agents that alter channel phosphorylation with channel permeability, as any of these agents might elicit secondary metabolic effects. One approach is to make gap junction channels accessible to study by splitting the isolated gap junctions and reconstituting them in an artificial lipid bilayer. Several studies report the induction of channel activities in a lipid bilayer by incorporating gap junction proteins into lipid vesicles (32Young J.D. Cohn Z.A. Gilula N.B.

In the present study, we reconstituted Cx43 gap junction channels in liposomes and measured the permeability with the use of iso-osmolar sucrose/urea density gradient sedimentation (34Harris A.L. Walter A. Paul D.L. Goodenough D.A. Zimmerberg J. Mol. Brain Res. 1992; 15: 269-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Our results indicate that MAP kinase phosphorylation of Cx43 directly modulates channel gating. Lissamine rhodamine B-labeled phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) was purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids, Inc. (Birmingham, AL). Bovine phosphatidylcholine, egg phosphatidylserine,N-octyl-β-d-glucopyranoside (octylglucoside), leupeptin, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, calf intestinal phosphatase (CIP) (conjugated to beaded agarose), and cyanogen bromide (CNBr)-activated Sepharose 4B beads were obtained from Sigma. CHAPS and dimethyl suberimidate·2HCl (DMS) were purchased from Pierce. MAP kinase (Erk2) was purchased from New England Biolabs (London, United Kingdom). [γ-32P]ATP (5000 Ci/mmol) was from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. The sequence of synthetic peptide SSRASSRPRPDDLEI corresponded to amino acid residues 368 to 382 of the C-terminal region of Cx43 (26Beyer E.C. Paul D.L. Goodenough D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 2621-2629Crossref PubMed Scopus (919) Google Scholar). The peptide was conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin, and antisera were then prepared by the method of Beyer et al. (38Beyer E.C. Kistler J. Paul D.L. Goodenough D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 595-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). Cx43 was immunoaffinity-purified by the modified method of Rhee et al. (36Rhee S.K. Bevans C.G. Harris A.L. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 9212-9223Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Brain tissue from Sprague-Dawley rats (∼1.3 g) was minced in 25 ml of 5 mm NaHCO3 buffer (pH 8.2) containing 5 mm EDTA and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and the homogenate was centrifuged at 48,000 × g for 10 min. The crude membrane fraction pellet was solubilized in buffer A (50 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.4), 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaF, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm leupeptin, and 0.75% CHAPS). After centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 1 h, the supernatant was loaded onto an immunoaffinity column in which anti-Cx43 antibody was cross-linked to CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B. After successive washes with buffer A and buffer A plus 0.5 m NaCl, the column was equilibrated with buffer A in which CHAPS was replaced with 80 mm octylglucoside. Bound Cx43 was eluted from the column by brief exposure to 50 mm sodium acetate buffer (pH 2.4) containing 10 mm KCl, 459 mm urea, 0.1 mm EDTA, 80 mm octylglucoside, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mm leupeptin. The affinity column eluent was rapidly neutralized by adding it directly to 0.3 volumes of neutralization buffer (1 m HEPES (pH 7.4), 10 mm KCl, 459 mm urea, 0.1 mmEDTA, and 80 mm octylglucoside). To prepare a denatured form of Cx43, a portion of the affinity column eluent was incubated at 30 °C for 3 h before it was mixed with the neutralization buffer. All the procedures were carried out at 4 °C. Immunoaffinity-purified Cx43 protein was analyzed by an 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. For staining the gel-bound protein with silver nitrate, the gel was preincubated in a mixture of ethanol, acetic acid, and water (4:1:5, v/v/v) for 1 h followed by an additional incubation in ethanol, acetic acid, and water (5:5:90, v/v/v) for 2 h. Protein bands were cross-linked by soaking the gel in a solution containing 1% glutaraldehyde and 0.5 msodium acetate for 30 min. The gel was rinsed extensively with deionized water, and the protein bands were stained in a freshly made 0.8% ammoniacal silver nitrate solution containing 0.02 nNaOH. After washing, the images were developed by incubating the gel in a solution containing 0.05% citric acid and 0.1% formaldehyde for 5 to 10 min. The reaction was stopped by transferring the gel into 5% Tris buffer containing 2% acetic acid. For immunoblot analysis, the gel-bound protein bands were electrotransferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, and the membrane was blocked by incubation for 1 h at 37 °C in 3% gelatin in Tris-buffered saline (25 mmTris-HCl (pH 8.3), 50 mm NaCl). The blocked membrane was then incubated in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20 and 10 μg/ml anti-Cx43 antibody with gentle shaking for 1 h at 37 °C. The membrane was transferred to Tris-buffered saline containing 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20 and incubated for 30 min with buffer changes every 10 min. The washed membrane was then incubated for 1 h at 37 °C with 0.5 μg/ml alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG. The Cx43 bands were developed in 0.1 mg/ml nitro blue tetrazolium and 0.05 mg/ml 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate in 10 mm Tris buffer (pH 9.5) containing 10 mmMgCl2 and 5 mm NaCl. The oligomeric state of immunoaffinity-purified Cx43 was examined by sucrose density sedimentation as described by Falk et al. (39Falk M.M. Buehler L.K. Kumar N.M. Gilula N.B. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2703-2716Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Immunoaffinity-purified Cx43 protein was loaded onto a 5-ml linear gradient of 5 to 20% (w/v) sucrose containing 10 mm Hepes (pH 7.4), 459 mm urea, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 80 mm octylglucoside. After centrifugation for 16 h at 200,000 × g, the gradients were fractionated, and 0.1 ml fractions were collected. Aliquots (50 μl) from the gradient fractions were transferred to microwell plates, and the amount of Cx43 in each fraction was quantified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using anti-Cx43 antibody. Standard proteins with known sedimentation coefficients (ovalbumin, 3.5 S; bovine serum albumin, 4.3 S) were subjected to sedimentation on a separate gradient and used to determine the S value of Cx43 oligomers. The quaternary structure of immunoaffinity-purified Cx43 protein was examined by chemical cross-linking using DMS as a coupling agent (40Musil L.S. Goodenough D.A. Cell. 1993; 74: 1065-1077Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar, 41Cascio M. Kumar N.M. Safarik R. Gilula N.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18643-18648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Aliquots of immunoaffinity-purified Cx43 protein (∼10 μg in 180 μl) in 10 mm triethanolamine buffer (pH 8.3) containing 80 mm octylglucoside, 10 mm KCl, and 0.1 mm EDTA were mixed with 20 μl of 10 mmtriethanolamine buffer (pH 8.3) containing 100 mm DMS. After incubation for 8 h at 4 °C, the cross-linking reaction was stopped by adding 1 μl of 1 m glycine buffer (pH 7.4) to each sample and incubating the reaction mixtures at room temperature for 30 min. The cross-linked protein samples were then denatured by adding an equal volume of SDS sample buffer containing 125 mm Tris-Cl (pH 6.8), 20% SDS, 10% β-mercaptoethanol, and 20% glycerol. The cross-linked complexes were analyzed by electrophoresis on a 4 to 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gradient gel followed by immunoblot analysis using anti-Cx43 antibody as described above. Cx43 channels were reconstituted in unilamellar phospholipid vesicles. A procedure for the incorporation of gap junction protein in unilamellar liposomes has been described (36Rhee S.K. Bevans C.G. Harris A.L. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 9212-9223Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The lipids phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylserine, and lissamine rhodamine B-labeled PE were dissolved in chloroform at a molar ratio of 2:1:0.05. Fluorescently labeled PE was used as a marker for liposomes in the gradient fractions. The lipid mixture was dried to a thin film under a stream of nitrogen gas, and the lipid film was suspended in 10 mm HEPES buffer (pH 7.4) containing 459 mm urea, 10 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 80 mm octylglucoside. Immunoaffinity-purified Cx43 was then added to the mixture, and the protein:lipid ratio was adjusted to 1:45 (w/w) for most procedures employed in this study. The protein-lipid mixture was applied to a Sephadex G-50 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) column (2 × 100 cm), and the column was eluted with a buffer containing 10 mmHEPES (pH 7.4), 459 mm urea, 10 mm KCl, and 0.1 mm EDTA at the flow rate of 0.1 ml/min. The liposomes were collected in the void volume of the column, whereas octylglucoside was retained by the column. The liposomes were concentrated by centrifugation at 240,000 × g for 18 h at 4 °C. The permeability of the Cx43 channels reconstituted in liposomes was examined by the technique of transport-specific density shift as described (34Harris A.L. Walter A. Paul D.L. Goodenough D.A. Zimmerberg J. Mol. Brain Res. 1992; 15: 269-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The liposomes were layered onto linear, 0 to 400 mm,iso-osmolar sucrose density gradients in which a reverse linear gradient of 459 to 0 mm urea in the same buffer compensated the sucrose gradient osmotically. The gradient was then centrifuged at 250,000 × g for 12 h at 4 °C. The distribution of fluorescently labeled liposomes in the gradient was photographed under UV illumination in the dark. The gradient was eluted through a hole formed at the bottom of a centrifuge tube, and the distribution of the lipid vesicles was determined by measuring the intensity of rhodamine fluorescence in each fraction with a spectrofluorometer (LS-3B, Perkin-Elmer) at 590 nm excited at 560 nm. To measure channel activity of Cx43 in the liposomes, the loss of lucifer yellow fluorescent communication dye from the liposomes was monitored. Liposomes formed with Cx43 in the presence of 3 mm lucifer yellow were layered on a gradient. After centrifugation at 250,000 × g for 12 h, gradients were eluted from the bottom. Each fraction was monitored for the fluorescence of lissamine rhodamine B-labeled PE in the liposome membrane. The amount of lucifer yellow retained in the liposomes was quantified by measuring its fluorescence intensity at 530 nm excited at 428 nm. Cx43 (∼30 μg) which was either solubilized in detergent or incorporated in liposomes was mixed with 0.1 volume of 50 mm Tris buffer (pH 8.0) containing 1 mm EDTA, 80 mm octylglucoside, and 50 units/ml agarose-conjugated CIP. The reaction mixtures were incubated for 3 h at 30 °C with gentle agitation. In the control experiment, an equal amount of agarose beads was added to the mixture to replace the agarose-conjugated CIP. The mixtures were then centrifuged for 5 min at 1,000 × g to remove the agarose beads and conjugated enzyme. Dephosphorylated protein samples were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide (8%) gel electrophoresis (PAGE) followed by immunoblot analysis with anti-Cx43 antibody. The permeability of liposomes containing dephosphorylated Cx43 was examined by sedimentation in an iso-osmolar sucrose density gradient. Dephosphorylated Cx43 (∼30 μg) was mixed with 0.1 volume of a buffer containing 100 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.4), 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm ATP, and 50 units/ml MAP kinase. The reaction mixture was incubated for 3 h at 30 °C in the presence or absence of [γ-32P]ATP (0. 1 mCi/ml). Protein samples phosphorylated in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP were resolved by 8% SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography. The permeability of liposomes formed with the MAP kinase-treated Cx43 was compared with that of untreated control Cx43 by sedimentation analysis in an iso-osmolar density gradient. Cx43, immunoaffinity-purified from rat brain using anti-Cx43 antibody, was resolved on an SDS-polyacrylamide (8%) gel, and a protein band with a molecular size of ∼41 kDa was detected by silver staining. Immunoblot analysis identified the band as Cx43 (Fig. 1). The anti-Cx43 antibody used in this study was directed against a nonconserved cytoplasmic epitope and may not cross-react with other types of connexins (27Dupont E. el Aoumari A. Fromaget C. Briand J.P. Gros D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 200: 263-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 38Beyer E.C. Kistler J. Paul D.L. Goodenough D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 595-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). Other connexin family proteins expressed in rat brain (27Dupont E. el Aoumari A. Fromaget C. Briand J.P. Gros D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 200: 263-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) were also probed using antibodies against connexin 32 (Cx32) and connexin 26 (Cx26), but no corresponding protein bands were detected (data not shown). The assembly of immunoaffinity-purified Cx43 was examined by velocity sedimentation in a sucrose density gradient, and the composition of the purified Cx43 complex was deciphered by chemical cross-linking with DMS. In previous studies, connexins were isolated from insoluble lipid membranes under denaturing conditions with the use of ionic detergents. It is possible that these isolation conditions alter the secondary structure of connexin proteins, influencing the ability of connexin subunits to assemble into gap junctional connexons, which are composed of six connexin subunits. Therefore we sought to determine whether Cx43 solubilized with a nonionic detergent (octylglucoside) under nondenaturing conditions maintained its oligomeric state after purification. To accomplish this, we subjected immunoaffinity-purified Cx43 to sucrose density gradient sedimentation. The gradient was fractionated, and the amount of Cx43 in each fraction was determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using an anti-Cx43 antibody. Two distinct Cx43 protein peaks corresponding to 5 S and 9 S particles were detected. Previous studies (39Falk M.M. Buehler L.K. Kumar N.M. Gilula N.B. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2703-2716Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that the 5 S Cx43 population contributes the monomeric form of the protein, whereas the 9 S species represents the hexameric form. Our data showed that only one-half of the purified Cx43 protein was assembled into connexons. When the Cx43 samples were denatured with a low pH treatment (pH 2.2), the 9 S Cx43 population was dissociated to yield the 5 S form (Fig.2 A). The quaternary structure of immunoaffinity-purified Cx43 was also examined by chemical cross-linking with DMS. DMS cross-linking of Cx43 monomers (∼41 kDa; Fig. 2 B, lane 1) produced a protein complex that migrated at ∼210 kDa (Fig. 2 B,lane 2). This 210-kDa estimate may not represent an accurate measurement of the molecular size of a connexon complex, as chemically cross-linked proteins often migrate farther than expected on SDS-polyacrylamide gels (42Staros J.V. Anjaneyulu P.S. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 172: 609-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). We next incorporated immunoaffinity-purified Cx43 protein into unilamellar phospholipid liposomes. The size of the liposomes is strongly influenced by the lipid:detergent ratio and by the chain length of the detergent molecules. In Rhee et al.(36Rhee S.K. Bevans C.G. Harris A.L. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 9212-9223Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), phospholipid unilamellar vesicles were constructed under the same experimental conditions as ours. The size distribution of the vesicles in that study was examined by filtration over a size exclusion high performance liquid chromatography column, and the average vesicle diameter was estimated to be 45 nm. Assuming a bilayer thickness of 4.0 nm and an average area of 0.7 nm2/phospholipid molecule (43Mimms L.T. Zampighi G.A. Nozaki Y. Tanford C. Reynolds J.A. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 833-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar), the protein:lipid ratio used in this study should give rise to contain an average of one gap junction channel per vesicle (36Rhee S.K. Bevans C.G. Harris A.L. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 9212-9223Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The Poisson distribution predicts that 67% of the vesicles will contain at least one connexon. The permeability of reconstituted Cx43 channels was examined by sedimentation velocity analysis of liposomes in an iso-osmolar sucrose density gradient (34Harris A.L. Walter A. Paul D.L. Goodenough D.A. Zimmerberg J. Mol. Brain Res. 1992; 15: 269-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Liposomes that were formed in the absence of Cx43 or with denatured Cx43 were sucrose-impermeable; thus they migrated only a short distance into the gradient and banded near the top of the gradient (Fig. 3 A,tubes 1 and 3). In contrast, liposomes formed with intact Cx43 were fractionated into two populations within the gradient, a sucrose-permeable fraction that migrated near the bottom of the gradient and a sucrose-impermeable fraction that migrated near the top (Fig. 3 A, tube 2). It has been suggested that sucrose-permeable liposomes that contain open Cx43 channels continuously equilibrate their internal solution with the surrounding external solution and thus migrate to a more dense position in the gradient. Liposomes that are impermeable to sucrose, either because they lack Cx43 channels or contain a closed form of the channels, are buoyed by the internal urea buffer, which is lighter than the external sucrose buffer. Impermeable liposomes are therefore retained at the top of the gradient (36Rhee S.K. Bevans C.G. Harris A.L. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 9212-9223Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). We next monitored the transfer of lucifer yellow, a well known communicating dye molecule, through reconstituted Cx43 channels. Liposomes were formed with or without Cx43 in the presence of 3 mm lucifer yellow, and the loss of the entrapped lucifer yellow from the liposomes was monitored. After velocity sedimentation, the liposomes in the iso-osmolar density gradient were eluted from the bottom of the tube. The amount of lucifer yellow retained in liposomes was quantified by measuring its fluorescence intensity at 530 nm excited at 428 nm. Liposomes formed with Cx43 fractionated into two populations within the gradient, but lucifer yellow was detectable only in the sucrose-impermeable fraction. Sucrose-permeable liposomes, which contained open Cx43 channels, specifically released lucifer yellow, whereas sucrose-impermeable liposomes retained the dye. These results suggest that sucrose-permeable channels formed with Cx43 are also permeable to lucifer yellow (Fig. 3 B). The respective permeability of liposomes formed with varying protein:lipid ratios is shown in Fig. 4. The data indicate that the fraction of sucrose-permeable liposomes increases with increasing concentrations of Cx43 incorporated. The effect of Cx43 phosphorylation on gap junctional permeability was presented (Fig. 5). Cx43 preparations from rat brain are known to contain both the phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated forms of the protein (27Dupont E. el Aoumari A. Fromaget C. Briand J.P. Gros D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 200: 263-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Our immunoaffinity-purified Cx43 was treated with CIP either before or after incorporation into liposomes. Treatment of Cx43 with CIP converted the 43-kDa phosphorylated form (Fig. 5, lanes 1and 3) into the dephosphorylated 41-kDa form (Fig. 5,lanes 2 and 4). The fraction of permeable liposomes containing Cx43 was increased by treating the liposome with CIP (Fig.5, tube 2). The distribution analysis of liposomes after sedimentation revealed that 15% of the total liposome population was sucrose-permeable. However, 27% of the total liposome population became sucrose-permeable if the liposomes were treated with CIP (5 units for 3 h) before sedimentation. The hypothesis that dephosphorylation of Cx43 increases gap junctional permeability is further supported by our subsequent experiment, which showed an increase in the permeability of liposomes formed with CIP-treated Cx43 (Fig. 5, tube 4). The fraction of permeable liposomes formed with dephosphorylated Cx43 was about 2-fold greater than that observed with control liposomes incorporated with intact Cx43 (Fig. 5,tubes 3 and 4). In an effort to further characterize the role of phosphorylation in the gating of gap junction channels, we used MAP kinase to phosphorylate solubilized Cx43 (Fig. 5, lane 5b). The fraction of permeable liposomes containing CIP-treated Cx43 was reduced by 79% if the dephosphorylated Cx43 became phosphorylated by MAP kinase (Fig. 5, tubes 5a and 5b). MAP kinase-dependent gating mechanism of Cx43 channels was further supported by the observation that MAP kinase-induced inhibition of channel permeability was reversed by treatment of Cx43 with CIP (Fig. 5, tube 5c). These data suggest that phosphorylation of Cx43 by MAP kinase may be directly involved in the channel gating process. Because protein kinase C has also been implicated in the regulation of GJC, we tested whether protein kinase C could phosphorylate the immunoaffinity-purified Cx43. Only a trace amount of phosphorylated Cx43 was detected by autoradiography, whereas histone H1, a known substrate protein of protein kinase C, was readily phosphorylated under the same experimental conditions (data not shown). Gap junctions are membrane channels that link end-to-end across the space between juxtaposed cells. In this study, we present evidence that the phosphorylation of connexin is directly involved in the gating mechanism of gap junction channels. We showed that the activity of Cx43 channels reconstituted in liposomes was dramatically increased by dephosphorylation of Cx43. The activity of the reconstitituted Cx43 channels was monitored by measuring the permeability of the liposomes to sucrose in an iso-osmolar sucrose density gradient. Several other studies have reported the functional reconstitution of connexons consisting of Cx26 (35Buehler L.K. Stauffer K.A. Gilula N.B. Kumar N.M. Biophys. J. 1995; 68: 1767-1775Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) and Cx32 (36Rhee S.K. Bevans C.G. Harris A.L. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 9212-9223Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Information regarding the gating mechanism of gap junction channels can be obtained from the assessment of the permeability of hemichannels to small molecules. Structural, biochemical, and physiological data show the hemichannels have properties that are similar to those of intact gap junctions. For example, the activities of hemichannels are, like those of intact gap junction channels, voltage-dependent. Trexler et al. (44Trexler E.B. Bennett M.V. Bargiello T.A. Verselis V.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5836-5841Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar) demonstrate the voltage-dependent gating properties of Cx46 hemichannels in excised patches from Xenopus oocytes. Hemichannels have also been shown to exist in the plasma membrane (45Malchow R.P. Qian H. Ripps H. J. Neurosci. Res. 1993; 35: 237-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 46DeVries S.H. Schwartz E.A. J. Physiol. 1992; 445: 201-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Several studies have proposed that the electrical coupling between horizontal cells of the fish retina occurs through hemichannels. Recently, Li et al. (47Li H. Liu T. Lazrak A. Peracchia C. Goldberg G.S. Lampe P.D. Johnson R.G. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 1019-1030Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar) presented data in support of the existence of nonjunctional plasma Cx43 hemichannels in Novicoff hepatoma cells. In this cell line, they measured properties of fluorescent dye transfer through nonjunctional hemichannels that were similar to those observed with gap junction channels. The hemichannels are believed to be typically in the closed state to prevent the loss of cytoplasmic solutes and the entry of extracellular ions. But some of the hemichannels formed in Xenopus oocyte membranes open by membrane depolarization (48Paul D.L. Ebihara L. Takemoto L.J. Swenson K.I. Goodenough D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 1077-1089Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar) and induce cation fluxes (44Trexler E.B. Bennett M.V. Bargiello T.A. Verselis V.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5836-5841Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). Open hemichannels were also shown to form in a system in which Cx32 channels were reconstituted in lipid vesicles that lacked the cytoplasmic or membrane factors necessary for maintaining the channels in a closed state (32Young J.D. Cohn Z.A. Gilula N.B. Cell. 1987; 48: 733-743Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 34Harris A.L. Walter A. Paul D.L. Goodenough D.A. Zimmerberg J. Mol. Brain Res. 1992; 15: 269-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 36Rhee S.K. Bevans C.G. Harris A.L. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 9212-9223Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). From the result of our study, we propose that Cx43 forms open hemichannels in lipid vesicles. The results herein showed that liposomes containing open Cx43 channels were permeable to sucrose and communicating dye (Fig. 3). Indeed we observed an increase in the fraction of permeable liposomes as more connexon protein was incorporated (Fig. 4). Although the gating mechanism of gap junction channels remains obscure, the rapid and reversible changes in the GJC by protein kinase activators have led to the hypothesis that gap junction channels undergo a conformational change by phosphorylation to gate the channels.

MAP kinase constitutes one of the most important protein kinase families for the progression of the cell cycle. Activated MAP kinase phosphorylates a variety of targets including other protein kinases and transcription factors (50Cobb M.H. Goldsmith E.J. J. Biol.

Recently it was shown that Cx43 is a substrate of MAP kinase and that the phosphorylation of Cx43 is mitosis-specific in many types of cells (11Xie H. Laird D.W. Chang T.H. Hu V.W. J.

https://openalex.org/W2010726206,"Poisoning with α-latrotoxin, a neurotoxic protein from black widow spider venom, results in a robust increase of spontaneous synaptic transmission and subsequent degeneration of affected nerve terminals. The neurotoxic action of α-latrotoxin involves extracellular binding to its high affinity receptors as a first step. One of these proteins, CIRL, is a neuronal G-protein-coupled receptor implicated in the regulation of secretion. We now demonstrate that CIRL has two close homologs with a similar domain structure and high degree of overall identity. These novel receptors, which we propose to name CIRL-2 and CIRL-3, together with CIRL (CIRL-1) belong to a recently identified subfamily of large orphan receptors with structural features typical of both G-protein-coupled receptors and cell adhesion proteins. Northern blotting experiments indicate that CIRL-2 is expressed ubiquitously with highest concentrations found in placenta, kidney, spleen, ovary, heart, and lung, whereas CIRL-3 is expressed predominantly in brain similarly to CIRL-1. It appears that CIRL-2 can also bind α-latrotoxin, although its affinity to the toxin is about 14 times less than that of CIRL-1. When overexpressed in chromaffin cells, CIRL-2 increases their sensitivity to α-latrotoxin stimulation but also inhibits Ca2+-regulated secretion. Thus, CIRL-2 is a functionally competent receptor of α-latrotoxin. Our findings suggest that although the nervous system is the primary target of low doses of α-latrotoxin, cells of other tissues are also susceptible to the toxic effects of α-latrotoxin because of the presence of CIRL-2, a low affinity receptor of the toxin.

G-protein-coupled receptor physiological salt solution human growth hormone 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid Poisoning with black widow spider venom results in the activation of spontaneous synaptic activity in the peripheral nervous system (1Clark A.W. Mauro A. Longenecker Jr., H.E. Hurlbut W.P. Nature. 1970; 225: 703-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The major component of the venom that is responsible for the toxic effects in vertebrates is α-latrotoxin, a large protein with multiple ankyrin repeats (2Frontali N. Ceccarelli B. Gorio A. Mauro A.

Purified α-latrotoxin causes spontaneous neurotransmitter release at neuromuscular junctions and in preparations of central neurons such as synaptosomes, brain slices, and primary neuronal cell cultures (5Rosenthal L. Meldolesi J. Pharmacol. Ther. 1989; 42: 115-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). It has been recently shown that the toxic effects of α-latrotoxin are not restricted to the nervous system and that it can also augment secretion from chromaffin cells and β-pancreatic cells (6Barnett D.W. Liu J. Misler S. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1996; 432: 1039-1046Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 7Bittner M.A. Krasnoperov V.G. Stuenkel E.L. Petrenko A.G. Holz R.W. J.

Spontaneous α-latrotoxin-stimulated secretion is paralleled by an increase in transmembrane cation fluxes through induced large conductance channels of unknown nature (9Grasso A. Alema S. Rufini S. Senni M.I. Nature. 1980; 283: 774-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). It has been thus suggested that ionophoric properties of α-latrotoxin are at the basis of its toxic effects. However, at least part of the action of α-latrotoxin may be independent of cation fluxes both in neurons and secretory cells (7Bittner M.A. Krasnoperov V.G. Stuenkel E.L. Petrenko A.G. Holz R.W. J.

Stimulation of neurotransmitter release by α-latrotoxin correlates with its extracellular binding to high affinity membrane receptors (5Rosenthal L. Meldolesi J. Pharmacol.

Harwood Academic Publishers, Amsterdam1998: 185-212Google Scholar). The toxin-binding sites in membrane preparations were originally identified in ligand binding assays with radiolabeled toxin (14Meldolesi J. J. Neurochem. 1982; 38: 1559-1569Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). In those experiments, the α-latrotoxin receptors were detected only in the preparations of neural tissues. By immunofluorescence with anti-α-latrotoxin antibodies, it was shown that α-latrotoxin-binding sites are localized presynaptically in neuro-muscular synapses and therefore might be directly involved in the regulation of neuronal exocytosis (15Valtorta F. Madeddu L. Meldolesi J. Ceccarelli B. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 99: 124-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Two types of high affinity α-latrotoxin receptors were identified by purification and molecular cloning: neurexin Iα, a calcium-dependent receptor (16Petrenko A.G. Kovalenko V.A. Shamotienko O.G.

Science. 1992; 257: 50-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar), and a calcium-independent receptor, CIRL, also called latrophilin (18Krasnoperov V.G. Bittner M.A. Beavis R. Kuang Y. Salnikow K.V. Chepurny O.G. Little A.R. Plotnikov A.N. Wu D. Holz R.W. Petrenko A.G. Neuron. 1997; 18: 925-937Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar, 19Lelianova V.G.

The interaction of neurexin Iα with α-latrotoxin significantly contributes to the effects of the toxin only in physiological high-Ca2+ media, whereas CIRL is important for the toxic effects either in physiological or in nominally Ca2+-free media (20Geppert M. Khvotchev M. Krasnoperov V. Goda Y. Missler M. Hammer R.E. Ichtchenko K. Petrenko A.G. Südhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1705-1710Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). CIRL is a G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR)1 with an unusually large N-terminal extracellular region that contains domains characteristic of cell adhesion proteins. CIRL is an interesting example of a two-subunit GPCR (18Krasnoperov V.G. Bittner M.A. Beavis R. Kuang Y. Salnikow K.V. Chepurny O.G. Little A.R. Plotnikov A.N. Wu D. Holz R.W. Petrenko A.G. Neuron. 1997; 18: 925-937Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). Its two noncovalently bound subunits (p120 and p85) result from the expression of one gene followed by endogenous proteolytic cleavage of the precursor protein in its extracellular region close to the first transmembrane segment. Similar posttranslational modification was reported for leukocyte antigen CD97, a large orphan GPCR homologous to CIRL (21Gray J.X. Haino M. Roth M.J. Maguire J.E. Jensen P.N. Yarme A. Stetler-Stevenson M.A. Siebenlist U. Kelly K. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 5438-5447PubMed Google Scholar). The functional properties of CIRL as an α-latrotoxin receptor were confirmed by the analysis of secretion in transfected chromaffin cells and β-pancreatic cells (7Bittner M.A. Krasnoperov V.G. Stuenkel E.L. Petrenko A.G. Holz R.W. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 2914-2922Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Lang J. Ushkaryov Y. Grasso A. Wollheim C.B.

Petrenko A.G. Neuron. 1997; 18: 925-937Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). When overexpressed, CIRL renders them supersensitive to the toxin. Interestingly, overexpression of CIRL in chromaffin cells also results in the modulation of physiologically evoked secretion in the absence of any stimulation with α-latrotoxin. The ATP-dependent stage of secretion is specifically inhibited by CIRL expression, suggesting that this receptor couples to exocytosis (7Bittner M.A. Krasnoperov V.G. Stuenkel E.L. Petrenko A.G. Holz R.W. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 2914-2922Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We now show that in addition to neuronal receptors neurexin Iα and CIRL, another α-latrotoxin-binding protein exists that is a ubiquitously expressed homolog of CIRL. This membrane protein, which we named CIRL-2, binds α-latrotoxin with lower affinity than CIRL (CIRL-1). Overexpression of CIRL-2 in chromaffin cells indicates that it is a functional receptor of α-latrotoxin and that, similarly to CIRL-1, it couples to exocytosis. Our results suggest that α-latrotoxin can produce toxic effects not only in neurons but also in other tissues. α-Latrotoxin was purified from lyophilized black widow spider glands and radioactively labeled with 125I by chloramine T procedure. The toxin was immobilized on BrCN-Sepharose as described (16Petrenko A.G. Kovalenko V.A. Shamotienko O.G. Surkova I.N. Tarasyuk T.A. Ushkaryov Y.A. Grishin E.V. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2023-2027Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Chromaffin cell and HEK293 cell transfections and functional analysis of CIRLs were performed as described previously (7Bittner M.A. Krasnoperov V.G. Stuenkel E.L. Petrenko A.G. Holz R.W. J.

Screening of a directionally cloned rat brain cDNA library in λZAPII (kindly provided by Dr. James Boulter, Salk Institute) has resulted in the isolation of clones highly homologous to the 5′-region of CIRL-1 cDNA (18Krasnoperov V.G.

Neuron. 1997; 18: 925-937Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar) but yet significantly different according to restriction endonuclease mapping and partial sequencing. Two sets of overlapping clones were identified encoding CIRL-2 cDNA (15–1, 15–7, 15–11, 15–12, 15–14, 15–19, and 15–20) and CIRL-3 cDNA (17–1, 17–2, 17–9, 17–14, 17–15, 17–17, 17–20, and 17–21). All plasmids were sequenced with T3 and T7 primers. The potentially full-length clones 15–19, 15–12, 17–9, and 17–20 were sequenced on both strands using synthetic primers. In addition, all clones were sequenced in the regions of alternative splicing, identified by restriction endonuclease mapping. The eukaryotic expression constructs of CIRLs were designed so that they contained minimal noncoding sequence in the 5′-region. The CIRL-2 expression plasmid pCDCIRL-2 was prepared by triple ligation of the fragmentBamHI/MfeI of the clone 15–12 and the fragmentMfeI/XhoI of the clone 15–19 into expression vector pCDNA 3.1 Zeo (+) (Invitrogen), predigested with restriction endonucleases BamHI and XhoI. The CIRL-3 expression plasmid pCDCIRL-3 was prepared by ligation of the fragmentNotI/XhoI of the clone 17–20 into the same expression vector, predigested withNotI/XhoI. Commercially available blots (CLONTECH) containing ∼2 μg of poly(A)+ RNA from human tissues were prehybridized for 24 h at 42 °C in the buffer H (50% formamide, 5× saline/sodium phosphate/EDTA, 5× Denhardt solution, 1.5% SDS, 200 μg/ml sonicated salmon sperm DNA, 2.5 mm sodium pyrophosphate) followed by hybridization in the same buffer under stringent conditions (50 °C, 16 h) with [α-32P]dCTP uniformly labeled probes of full-length CIRL-2 or CIRL-3 (Random Primed DNA labeling kit, Boehringer Mannheim). The unincorporated label was removed with ProbeQuant G-50 Micro Columns (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). For hybridization, the probes were diluted with buffer H to final concentrations of 5–7 × 107 cpm/ml. After the hybridization, the blots were washed 3–4 times for 25 min each in 2× SSC (0.15 m NaCl and 0.015 m sodium citrate) with 1% SDS at ascending temperatures starting from 60 °C, with 2 °C increment. The blots were dried and autoradiographed with an x-ray film and intensifying screen at −70 °C for 3–7 days. A DNA fragment encoding the extracellular region of CIRL-2 was prepared by a PCR reaction on pCDCIRL-2 as template with primers CGAGGATCCTTCAGCAGAGCAGCCTTGCCA and GTGCTCGAGGTGGCTGCATGCACACGTCGT. The 2500-base pair polymerase chain reaction product was digested with restriction endonucleasesBamHI and XhoI and subcloned into predigested vectors pET21a to yield plasmid pET21CIRL-2. The plasmid was transformed into the Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) strain, and individual colonies were isolated and propagated in 1 liter of LB media at room temperature until bacterial cultures reached mid log phase (∼8 h). At this point, isopropyl-1-thio-b-d-galactopyranoside solution was added to 50 μm final concentration. 4 h post-induction, the cells were harvested, washed, and lysed by ultrasound sonication in 50 ml of hypotonic buffer A (10 mm NaCl, 25 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0) with the addition of protease inhibitors mixture (Boehringer Mannheim). The lysate was centrifuged for 30 min at 40,000 rpm, and the insoluble pellet was resuspended in 50 ml of buffer B (450 mm NaCl, 8 m urea, 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0) and centrifuged for 30 min at 40,000 rpm. The supernatant was chromatographed on 2 ml of Ni2+-matrix (Novagen) pre-equilibrated with the buffer B. After intermediate washes with buffer B supplemented with 50 mm imidazole, the extracellular CIRL-2 fragment was eluted in buffer B containing 200 mm imidazole. The eluate was sequentially dialyzed against buffer B with gradually decreased concentration of urea from 6m to zero. The recombinant proteins were used for custom production of antibodies in rabbits (Alpha Diagnostics). Expression plasmids encoding CIRLs (pCDR7, pCDCIRL-2, and pCDCIRL-3) were transfected into COS-7 cells by LipofectAMINE procedure with Opti-MEM I serum-free medium according to the manufacturer's protocol (Life Technologies, Inc.). The transfected cells were harvested 48–72 h after transfection. For Western blotting analysis, approximately 30% of the COS cells harvested from one 100-mm dish were solubilized with 2% Triton X-100 low salt buffer (10 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5). After a 15-min centrifugation at 80,000 × g, the supernatant was incubated with 20 μl of α-latrotoxin-agarose for 16 h with rotation. After 2 washes with phosphate-buffered saline, the beads were eluted with 50 μl of 2× SDS sample buffer. 15 μl of the eluate was analyzed by separation in 10% SDS gel electrophoresis followed by Western blotting with anti-CIRL-1 and anti-CIRL-2 antibodies. Approximately 5 g of each frozen rat tissue (brain, heart, lung, kidney, spleen) and 0.5 g of ovaries (Pel-Freez Biologicals) were homogenized (Polytron) in 25 ml of a low salt buffer (10 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, final pH 7.5) with protease inhibitors mixture (Boehringer Mannheim) followed by 2% Triton X-100 solubilization for 3 h, and 30 min of centrifugation at 80,000 × g. The 15-ml supernatant fractions were incubated with 50 μl of α-latrotoxin-agarose and washed twice with a high salt buffer (750 mm NaCl, 20 mmTris-HCl, 1% Triton X-100, pH 7.5). Protein from the beads was eluted with SDS sample buffer followed by SDS electrophoresis and Western blotting with the appropriate polyclonal antibodies. In the course of molecular cloning of CIRL (CIRL-1), two sets of cDNA clones were isolated that were homologous and yet significantly different from CIRL-1 cDNA (18Krasnoperov V.G. Bittner M.A. Beavis R. Kuang Y. Salnikow K.V. Chepurny O.G. Little A.R. Plotnikov A.N. Wu D. Holz R.W. Petrenko A.G. Neuron. 1997; 18: 925-937Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). Significant homology of these novel sequences with CIRL cDNA was found in the region encoding the N-terminal region of CIRL. These clones were characterized by mapping with restriction endonucleases and partial DNA sequencing. Several clones were identified that contained a large open reading frame with a Kozak consensus sequence and upstream stop codons in all frames in the 5′-end and a poly(A) sequence in the 3′-end, suggesting that they contained full-length cDNAs with respect to the coding sequence. These cDNA clones were sequenced completely on both strands. The protein sequences of CIRL-2 and CIRL-3 were deduced from the cDNA sequences. Multiple alignment of three CIRL sequences revealed significant homology of these proteins (Fig.1 A). A major difference among them was that CIRL-3 contained an additional small domain in the N-terminal region right after the signal peptide sequence (Fig.1 B). The cytoplasmic C-terminal region of CIRLs was significantly less conserved in these proteins than their extracellular and membrane domains. Also, the Ser, Thr, and Pro-rich domain (STP domain) located in the center of the N-terminal extracellular region of CIRLs showed very little degree of conservation.Figure 1The structure of the CIRL receptors. A, the amino acid sequences of CIRL-2 and CIRL-3 (GenBank™ accession numbers AF063102, AF063103) are shown aligned with the sequence of CIRL-1 (U72487). The alignment was produced by Clustal algorithm. B, the domain model of the CIRLs. The N-terminal domain shown after the signal peptide sequence is present only in CIRL-3. SR, the secretin receptor family;PM, plasma membrane.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) We analyzed the sequences of the newly cloned proteins by BLAST searches of protein data bases. The searches revealed that the CIRLs is a subfamily of the secretin receptor family of GPCRs. CIRLs have seven transmembrane hydrophobic segments that are homologous to other members of the secretin receptor family. Several large orphan GPCRs were identified by searches that are significantly homologous to CIRLs not only in their transmembrane hydrophobic segments but also in a relatively short (about 80 residues) region that is adjacent to the transmembrane core N-terminus and, therefore, should be exposed extracellularly (Fig. 1 B). Because this domain is involved in the endogenous proteolytic processing of CIRL-1 and possibly other receptors, we propose to name it GPS which stands for GPCRproteolyticsite. 2V. Krasnoperov, K. Ichtchenko, and A. G. Petrenko, manuscript in preparation. Interestingly, the N-terminal tails of other members of the secretin receptor family, in addition to the large orphan GPCRs, are also homologous to CIRLs. However, this region of homology is separated by about 350 residues from the transmembrane core of CIRLs (Fig.1 B). The same Cys-rich motif is also found in other large orphan receptors of the secretin receptor family. In the N termini, after the domain found only in CIRL-3, the CIRLs have domains homologous to a sea urchin lectin and to olfactomedin (Fig.1 B). The variable between homologs STP domain is followed by a region that is homologous between the CIRL homologs and three recently discovered genes of the BAI (brain-specific angiogenesis inhibitor) family (23Nishimori H.

To further characterize CIRL-2 and CIRL-3, we analyzed their tissue distribution by Northern blotting (Fig. 2). In contrast with CIRL-1, which is predominantly expressed in brain, CIRL-2 messages were found almost in all tissues tested although in variable concentrations. The highest levels of CIRL-2 were found in placenta, heart, lung, kidney, pancreas, spleen, and ovary. Brain, liver, and testis showed intermediate amounts of CIRL-2. The lowest quantities of this mRNA were detected in skeletal muscle, whereas in thymus and peripheral blood leukocytes, no signal could be detected at this level of sensitivity. The CIRL-3 mRNA was expressed predominantly in brain with significantly lower levels in heart, placenta, pancreas, kidney, and testis. Structural similarity between CIRL-1 and its newly cloned homologs CIRL-2 and CIRL-3 suggested that the latter two may also serve as receptors of α-latrotoxin. To test this hypothesis, the expression plasmids encoding CIRL-2 and CIRL-3 were prepared on the basis of pcDNA3.1 eukaryotic vector and transfected into COS cells. The transfected cells were analyzed for their α-latrotoxin binding activity using radiolabeled α-latrotoxin. CIRL-1- and CIRL-2-expressing cells bound iodinated α-latrotoxin specifically, whereas no binding was observed in CIRL-3 and mock-transfected cells (data not shown). The binding activity of CIRL-2 transfected cells was reproducibly lower than of the cells expressing CIRL-1. This could be explained by either lower affinity of CIRL-2 or by different expression efficiency of the receptors or by both. To discriminate between these possibilities, we analyzed α-latrotoxin binding activity of CIRL-1- and CIRL-2-expressing cells by Scatchard plots (Fig.3). The cells that were transfected with CIRL-2 plasmid showed higher concentration of α-latrotoxin-binding sites. However, the affinity of CIRL-2 to α-latrotoxin was about 14 times lower than the affinity of CIRL-1. The results of the binding experiments were confirmed by precipitation of solubilized transfected cells with an immobilized α-latrotoxin matrix. The adsorbed proteins were eluted from α-latrotoxin-agarose and analyzed by Western blotting with anti-CIRL-1 and anti-CIRL-2 antibodies directed against their N-terminal extracellular regions (Fig. 4). Both CIRL-1 and CIRL-2 were specifically detected by the antibodies as M r120,000 bands. This result indicates that CIRL-2 is an α-latrotoxin-binding protein and that it is proteolytically processed in the same manner as CIRL-1. With a long exposure shown, some cross-reactivity of the antibodies could be noted. No CIRLs were detected in mock-transfected COS cells, although Northern blotting indicated that CIRL-2 is ubiquitously expressed protein. We may thus assume that either this cell line does not contain CIRL-2 at all or the simian protein is not recognized by our antibody raised against the rat protein or that the levels of this receptor in COS cells are beyond the sensitivity of this assay. Neither anti-CIRL-1 nor anti-CIRL-2 antibody could produce any staining of CIRL-3 transfected cells on Western blots. The functional properties of CIRL-2 were examined in HEK293 cells and bovine chromaffin cells. When transfected HEK293 cells were exposed to 50 pm α-latrotoxin in PSS containing both Ca2+ and Mg2+, CIRL-2 supported a substantial45Ca uptake as did CIRL-1 (Fig.5). A small amount of α-latrotoxin-stimulated uptake occurred in cells expressing pCMVneo and in untransfected cells (not shown), suggesting the presence of an endogenous α-latrotoxin receptor. We have previously shown that overexpression of CIRL-1 in chromaffin cells results in at least 10-fold increase in their sensitivity to the toxin (7Bittner M.A. Krasnoperov V.G. Stuenkel E.L. Petrenko A.G. Holz R.W. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 2914-2922Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Krasnoperov V.G. Bittner M.A. Beavis R. Kuang Y. Salnikow K.V. Chepurny O.G. Little A.R. Plotnikov A.N. Wu D. Holz R.W. Petrenko A.G. Neuron. 1997; 18: 925-937Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). The ability of CIRL-2 to support α-latrotoxin-induced Ca2+ influx was also coupled to an increase in secretion. Chromaffin cells were cotransfected with a plasmid encoding human growth hormone (hGH) and with either a plasmid encoding the CIRL-2 or a control plasmid. Transiently expressed hGH is stored in secretory granules and serves as a marker for regulated secretion from the small population of transfected cells. Chromaffin cells expressing CIRL-2 and hGH were incubated for 4 min with various concentrations of α-latrotoxin in PSS without Ca2+ or Mg2+ and with 0.2 mm EGTA. The incubation with toxin in the absence of Ca2+ (during which no secretion occurs (7Bittner M.A. Krasnoperov V.G. Stuenkel E.L. Petrenko A.G. Holz R.W. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 2914-2922Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was followed by an incubation with PSS containing Ca2+ and Mg2+. Expression of CIRL-2 enhanced the sensitivity of cells to α-latrotoxin, as evidenced by the shift to the left in the dose response curve for hGH secretion (Fig.6). Thus, CIRL-2 functions as an α-latrotoxin receptor. Furthermore, as is the case with CIRL itself, CIRL-2 binds latrotoxin in the absence of Ca2+. We previously demonstrated that expression of CIRL-1 inhibits Ca2+-dependent secretion in permeabilized chromaffin cells in the absence of α-latrotoxin (7Bittner M.A. Krasnoperov V.G. Stuenkel E.L. Petrenko A.G. Holz R.W. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 2914-2922Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The data suggested that CIRL-1 regulates secretion by slowing a specific step in the ATP-dependent priming pathway. We thus determined whether CIRL-2 was similarly able to regulate secretion in permeabilized cells. Chromaffin cells transfected with or without CIRL-2 were permeabilized with 20 μm digitonin for 4 min in KGEP buffer 139 mm potassium glutamate, 20 mm PIPES, pH 6.6, 2 mm MgATP, 5 mmEGTA) containing 2 mm MgATP but without Ca2+followed by a 2-min stimulation with 30 μmCa2+ in the continuing presence of MgATP. Expression of CIRL-2 inhibited Ca2+-dependent secretion by 42% (Fig. 7), which is comparable with the inhibition seen with CIRL-1. Thus, we conclude that the CIRL-2 protein is a functional α-latrotoxin receptor with properties (e.g. Ca2+-independence of α-latrotoxin binding, inhibition of secretion in permeabilized cells) that resemble those of CIRL-1. Our experiments on the expression of CIRL-2 indicated that CIRL-2 is an α-latrotoxin-binding protein and that it can serve as a functional receptor of the toxin. The mRNA of CIRL-2 was detected in various tissues not belonging to the nervous system, in some of them (e.g. kidney) at significantly higher concentrations than in brain. However, the presence of α-latrotoxin receptors in other than neural or neuroendocrine tissues has never been reported. We prepared crude kidney membranes and analyzed them for binding of radiolabeled α-latrotoxin in the same manner as we did with brain membranes. No statistically significant specific binding could be detected in kidney membranes in this assay (data not shown). To reconcile these apparently contradictory data, we tested various tissues for the presence of α-latrotoxin receptors using a more sensitive assay (Fig. 8). The tissues were homogenized and extracted with a Triton X-100-containing buffer, and the extracts were chromatographed on α-latrotoxin-agarose. The adsorbed proteins were eluted with the SDS sample buffer and analyzed by Western blotting with anti-CIRL-1 and anti-CIRL-2 antibody. The staining with anti-CIRL-1 antibody verified the presence of CIRL-1 exclusively in neural tissues. In contrast, CIRL-2 was detected in almost all tissues tested, although the relative amount of CIRL-2 in brain extracts was noticeably higher than could be predicted from the results of Northern blotting. A possible explanation would be cross-reactivity of the anti-CIRL-2 antibody with significant amounts of CIRL-1 purified from the brain along with CIRL-2. The action of α-latrotoxin in neurons requires its extracellular binding to high affinity membrane receptors of two structurally and functionally different types. Type I or calcium-dependent receptors are represented by neurexin Iα and, possibly, other neurexins that are neuron-specific cell membrane proteins with one transmembrane domain and the extracellular region typical for cell adhesion molecules. Neurexin Iα is responsible for part of α-latrotoxin effects in physiological Ca2+-containing media. Type II receptors can bind α-latrotoxin independently of Ca2+ presence in the extracellular media. CIRL, a recently discovered representative of the second class of α-latrotoxin receptors, is a G-protein-coupled receptor with unusual two-subunit structure. We now demonstrate that CIRL (CIRL-1) belongs to a novel family of large orphan GPCRs that is encoded by at least three different genes. One of these proteins, CIRL-2, is a low affinity calcium-independent receptor of α-latrotoxin. Our current data suggest that the toxic effects of α-latrotoxin have an even more complex mechanism than was thought earlier because, in addition to two high affinity neuronal receptors, a third, low affinity receptor exists that is expressed ubiquitously. Several independent experiments indicate that CIRL-2 is an α-latrotoxin receptor. When expressed in COS cells, it binds radiolabeled α-latrotoxin with affinity in the nm range, which is approximately 14 times lower than the affinity of CIRL-1. In HEK293 cells with overexpressed CIRL-2, α-latrotoxin stimulates robust Ca2+ fluxes, an effect that follows the interaction of the toxin with its receptors. Finally, in a chromaffin cell system that allows analysis of secretion quantitatively, CIRL-2 overexpression results in a significant increase in their sensitivity to α-latrotoxin. This effect is less pronounced than in the cells with overexpressed CIRL-1 (7Bittner M.A. Krasnoperov V.G. Stuenkel E.L. Petrenko A.G. Holz R.W. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 2914-2922Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which correlates with a lower affinity of CIRL-2 to the toxin. Unexpectedly, Northern blotting experiments revealed that, in contrast to CIRL-1 and CIRL-3, CIRL-2 is a ubiquitously expressed protein. α-Latrotoxin has been thought to be a specific presynaptic neurotoxin because the primary site of its physiologic toxicity is the neuromuscular junctions (5Rosenthal L. Meldolesi J. Pharmacol. Ther. 1989; 42: 115-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). A highly sensitive assay was developed to detect CIRL-2 in tissues. We raised anti-CIRL-2 antibody, which was directed against the extracellular domain of the receptor. A similar antibody against CIRL-1 showed very little cross-reactivity with CIRL-2 and vice versa. Using these antibodies, we were able to detect CIRL-1 and CIRL-2 in tissue extracts enriched by a chromatography on immobilized α-latrotoxin (Fig. 8). In close agreement with the data from Northern blotting, CIRL-2 was detected in brain, heart, lung, kidney, and spleen tissues, whereas CIRL-1 could be found only in brain. CIRL-2, detected in this experiment, must represent an α-latrotoxin-binding protein, because it was precipitated with α-latrotoxin-agarose. We may therefore conclude that α-latrotoxin receptors are present in nonneural tissues. CIRL-2 concentrations in various tissues are significantly lower than the concentration of CIRL-1 in brain, which hampered their direct detection by the 125I-latrotoxin binding assay. Another possible explanation would be that CIRL-2 in nonneuronal cells is not transported to the plasma membrane. However, this seems unlikely because when CIRL-2 is overexpressed in nonneuronal COS cells, α-latrotoxin receptors can be reliably detected on the cell surface. What might be the consequences of α-latrotoxin interaction with CIRL-2 in nonneural tissues? α-Latrotoxin treatment in neurons produces two major effects, spontaneous neurotransmitter release and degeneration of nerve terminals accompanied by general cytotoxicity. In nonneuronal cells, secretory granules, if present, can undergo exocytosis in response to α-latrotoxin. This has been demonstrated for chromaffin and β-pancreatic cells and may be also true for secretory cells of other types. α-Latrotoxin also induces formation of cation-selective pores of high conductance after the binding to its receptors. The fact that these pores are permeable to Ca2+ may explain cytotoxic effects as well as the secretagogue function of the toxin. In CIRL-1-transfected HEK293 cells, robust Ca2+ transmembrane fluxes were observed (7Bittner M.A. Krasnoperov V.G. Stuenkel E.L. Petrenko A.G. Holz R.W. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 2914-2922Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A similar effect was noted in nontransfected cells, however it was weaker and required higher concentrations of the toxin (25Krasnoperov V.G. Bittner M.A. Holz R.W. Chepurny O. Petrenko A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3590-3596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). One of the explanations of this effect is that α-latrotoxin interacts with endogenous CIRL-2. If α-latrotoxin could induce similar cation channels in various nonneuronal cells, they would cause cellular toxicity as a result of Ca2+entry. CIRL-1, CIRL-2, and CIRL-3 define a novel family of GPCRs. The homology of their protein sequence is quite strong, and their domain structure is almost identical. At least two of them, CIRL-1 and CIRL-2, are α-latrotoxin-binding proteins. In our experiments, no α-latrotoxin binding of CIRL-3 could be detected. However, because the expression of CIRL-3 could not be verified with available antibodies, we cannot make any definite conclusion about α-latrotoxin binding properties of CIRL-3 at this time. Homology searches indicate that CIRLs are part of a novel growing family of large orphan GPCRs with unusual structural features. These receptors include leukocyte antigen CD97, EMR1 hormone receptor (F4/80), the BAI family, an orphan receptor from brain similar toDrosophila melanogaster cadherin-related tumor suppresser, MEGF2 protein, and two putative GPCRs identified by sequencing theCaenorhabditis elegans genome (GenBank™ accession numbers Z54306 and U39848). The members of this family share highest homology in their transmembrane domains and in a short adjacent extracellular Cys-rich GPS domain. CIRL-1, CIRL-2, and CD97 are proteolytically processed endogenously (18Krasnoperov V.G. Bittner M.A. Beavis R. Kuang Y. Salnikow K.V. Chepurny O.G. Little A.R. Plotnikov A.N. Wu D. Holz R.W. Petrenko A.G. Neuron. 1997; 18: 925-937Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar, 21Gray J.X. Haino M. Roth M.J. Maguire J.E. Jensen P.N. Yarme A. Stetler-Stevenson M.A. Siebenlist U. Kelly K. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 5438-5447PubMed Google Scholar), and the integrity of the GPS domain is required for the proteolytic processing of CIRL-1.2 We may therefore hypothesize that all orphan GPCRs with the GPS motif are endogenously cleaved and, thus, consist of two heterologous subunits similarly to CIRL-1. Another common structural feature of this family of large orphan GPCRs is that the extracellular regions of these receptors contain structural modules typical for cell adhesion or extracellular matrix proteins. These modules include EGF motifs, thrombospondin repeats, STP or mucin-like domains, and lectin- and olfactomedin-related domains. These “chimeric” receptors may therefore have a dual function as signaling receptors and cell adhesion proteins. It is also possible that intercellular contacts may serve as agonists to activate these receptors. α-Latrotoxin produces strong intracellular response as a result of its interaction with CIRL-1 and CIRL-2. However, it remains unclear whether α-latrotoxin can work as an agonist or antagonist of CIRL and produce any receptor-mediated signaling. Our recent experiments with C-terminal deletion mutants of CIRL-1 suggest that G-protein-signaling is not critically important for α-latrotoxin-stimulated secretion in chromaffin cells (25Krasnoperov V.G. Bittner M.A. Holz R.W. Chepurny O. Petrenko A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3590-3596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The endogenous ligands of CIRLs are not known yet. Chromaffin cell transfection experiments suggest that CIRLs may act as physiological receptors and regulators of secretion because overexpression of CIRL-1 and CIRL-2 results in the inhibition of calcium-evoked secretion (Ref. 7Bittner M.A. Krasnoperov V.G. Stuenkel E.L. Petrenko A.G. Holz R.W. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 2914-2922Crossref PubMed Google Scholar and Fig. 7). Identification of endogenous ligands and intracellular effectors of CIRLs in the future experiments will be a next important step to better understand the physiological importance of the CIRLs."
https://openalex.org/W1992469716,"During sustained depolarization, voltage-gated Ca2+ channels progressively undergo a transition to a nonconducting, inactivated state, preventing Ca2+ overload of the cell. This transition can be triggered either by the membrane potential (voltage-dependent inactivation) or by the consecutive entry of Ca2+(Ca2+-dependent inactivation), depending on the type of Ca2+ channel. These two types of inactivation are suspected to arise from distinct underlying mechanisms, relying on specific molecular sequences of the different pore-forming Ca2+ channel subunits. Here we report that the voltage-dependent inactivation (of the α1ACa2+ channel) and the Ca2+-dependent inactivation (of the α1C Ca2+ channel) are similarly influenced by Ca2+ channel β subunits. The same molecular determinants of the β subunit, and therefore the same subunit interactions, influence both types of inactivation. These results strongly suggest that the voltage and the Ca2+-dependent transitions leading to channel inactivation use homologous structures of the different α1 subunits and occur through the same molecular process.

During sustained depolarizations, all of these Ca2+ currents progressively undergo a voltage-dependent inactivation with specific kinetics, primarily regulated by the membrane potential (2Pelzer D.

Of particular interest in the case of the L-type voltage-gated Ca2+ channels is the existence of a second type of inactivation driven by the intracellular Ca2+ concentration (10Brehm P. Eckert R.

In this case, Ca2+ ions entering into the cell through calcium channels can bind to a specific site located close to the inner mouth of the channel and promote the so-called Ca2+-dependent inactivation (12Chad J.

This type of inactivation, as opposed to the voltage-dependent inactivation, is not recorded when Ba2+ or Sr2+ permeate the channel (2Pelzer D. Pelzer S. McDonald T.F. Rev. Physiol. Biochem.

While voltage-dependent inactivation has been found in all types of Ca2+ channels, the Ca2+-dependent inactivation seems to be specific to the L-type, dihydropyridine-sensitive, Ca2+channels and has been suggested to arise from a completely different mechanism (5Carbone E.

The α1 subunit is an integral membrane protein organized in four homologous domains, each containing six α-helical membrane-spanning segments (23Snutch T.P. Reiner P.B. Curr. Opin.

It has been shown that the differences in the kinetics of the voltage-dependent inactivation between two distinct α1 subunits (encoding class E and A calcium channels, respectively) were due to the segment S6 of the first domain (I-S6) (30Zhang J.F. Ellinor P.T. Aldrich R.W. Tsien R.W. Nature. 1994; 372: 97-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar), suggesting a role for important and delimited molecular structures in the process of inactivation as was the case for K+ channels (43Hoshi T. Zagotta W.N. Aldrich R.W. Science. 1990; 250: 533-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (1280) Google Scholar). On the other hand, a typical Ca2+ binding site (44de Leon M. Wang Y. Jones L. Perez Reyes E. Wei X. Soong T.W. Snutch T.P. Yue D.T. Science. 1995; 270: 1502-1506Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar) and other regions involved in the Ca2+-dependent inactivation (45Soldatov N.M. Zuhlke R.D.

The identification of two different structures regulating voltage and Ca2+-dependent inactivation supports the hypothesis of different underlying mechanisms for these two types of inactivation. However, donation of this Ca2+ binding site (EF-hand motif) to the α1E subunit gave chimerical Ca2+ channels that did support Ca2+-dependent inactivation, whereas the parental α1E subunit did not. The fact that Ca2+-dependent inactivation can be transplanted by the sole donation of a Ca2+ binding site presupposes that the molecular backbone responsible for the closure of the channel during sustained depolarization may be shared by voltage- and Ca2+-dependent inactivation and would therefore be present on all types of Ca2+ channel. To test this hypothesis, we have compared the regulation of inactivation of the class A and class C Ca2+ channels by different β subunits in conditions where pure voltage and Ca2+-dependent mechanisms drove inactivation, respectively. We found that voltage and Ca2+-dependent inactivations were similarly regulated by the four β subunits. Moreover, deleted or chimerical forms of the β subunit that altered the regulation of the voltage-dependent inactivation also modified the Ca2+-dependent inactivation. We proposed a scheme for the inactivation mechanism and suggested that common distal steps shared by Ca2+- and voltage-dependent inactivations use homologous molecular structures. This scheme may be useful in elaborating new experiments designed to understand the molecular mechanisms underlying voltage and Ca2+-dependent inactivations. The following calcium channel subunits were used: α1A (47Starr T.V. Prystay W. Snutch T.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Ndel-β2 was obtained by PCR.1 The sense primer was engineered to possess an EcoRI site (italic type), a start codon (boldface type), and the 748–769 sequence (underlined, accession number M80545) of the β2a subunit (5′-GGAATTC ATG GAGAACATGAGGCTACAGCAGCATG-3′). In the reverse primer, an XbaI site was added at the 5′-end of the 2190–2168 sequence of β2a(5′-GCTCTAGA TCATTGGCGGATGTATACATCCC-3′). The PCR product was checked and purified on agarose gel. The chimera were obtained by a PCR strategy as described (52Horton R.M. Hunt H.D. Ho S.N. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 61-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (2648) Google Scholar). The N-terminal fragments were amplified using the following primers: for βch1, sense primer, 5′-GGAATTCAGCCCCCTGAAAGGAGATC-3′ (representingEcoRI plus positions 114–133 of β2a) and reverse primer, 5′-CAGCAGGCGAAGGCTGTCTAGTTTGACCGGGCTTG-3′ (representing positions 576–559 of β1b, accession numberX61394, plus positions 747–731 of β2a); for βch4, sense primer same as βch1 sense primer and reverse primer, 5′-GTAGGACTCTGCTGAGCCATAGGACACCCGTACTC-3′ (representing positions 235–249 of β1b + positions407–423 of β2a); for βch5, sense primer, 5′-GGAATTCATGGTCCAGAAGAGCGGCATG-3′ (representingEcoRI plus positions 67–84 of β1b) and reverse primer, 5′-TAGGAGTCTGCCGAACCCTGACGGACAAAGCTGTT-3′ (representing positions 424–440 of β2a plus positions217–234 of β1b). The C-terminal fragments were amplified using the following primers: for βch1, sense primer, 5′-CAAGCCCGGTCAAACTAGACAGCCTTCGCCTGCTG-3′ (representing positions 731–747 of β2a plus positions559–576 of β1b) and reverse primer, 5′-GCTCTAGATCAGCGGATGTAGACGCCTTG-3′ (representingXbaI plus positions 1857–1837 of β1b); for βch4, sense primer, 5′-GAGTACGGGTGTCCTATGGCTCAGCAGAGTCCTAC-3′ (representing positions 407–423 of β2a plus positions235–249 of β1b) and reverse primer same as the βch1 reverse primer; for βch5, sense primer, 5′-AACAGCTTTGTCCGTCAGGGTTCGGCAGACTCCTC-3′ (representing positions 217–234 of β1b plus positions 424–440 of β2a) and reverse primer, 5′-GCTCTAGATCATTGGCGGATGTATACATCCC-3′ (representingXbaI plus positions 2168–2190 of β2a). All PCR products were separated on 1% agarose gel, cut out, and purified. A second PCR was performed using these products to produce the final chimeras. Ndel-β2 and -β chimera were finally digested using EcoRI and XbaI, subcloned into pBluescript (Stratagene) for sequencing (DiDeoxy Terminator technology; Applied Biosystems), and subsequently subcloned into pMT2 for injection and expression. I-II and III-IV loops of the α1A and α1Csubunits were produced by PCR, subcloned into pBluescript, and in vitro transcribed (T7 m-Message m-Machine; Ambion) for oocyte injection (at an mRNA concentration of 1 μg/μl). Correct translation and molecular weight of these loops were checked byin vitro translation (T7-TNT coupled reticulocyte lysate system from Promega). Xenopus oocyte preparation and injection (5–10 nl of α1, α1 plus β, or α1 plus α2-δ plus β cDNAs at ∼0.3 ng/nl) were performed as described elsewhere (42Mangoni M.E. Cens T. Dalle C. Nargeot J. Charnet P. Receptors Channels. 1997; 5: 1-14PubMed Google Scholar, 53Cens T. Mangoni M.E. Richard S. Nargeot J. Charnet P. Pflugers Arch. 1996; 431: 771-774PubMed Google Scholar). Oocytes were then incubated for 2–7 days at 19 °C under gentle agitation before recording. Whole cell Ba2+and Ca2+ currents were recorded under two-electrode voltage clamp using the GeneClamp 500 amplifier (Axon Instruments, Burlingame, CA). Current and voltage electrodes (less than 1 megaohm) were filled with 2.8 m CsCl, 10 mm BAPTA, pH 7.2, with CsOH. Ca2+ and Ba2+ current recordings were performed after injection of BAPTA (one or two 40–70-ms injections at 1 bar of 100 mm BAPTA free acid (Sigma), 10 mmCsOH, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, using solutions of the following composition: 10 mm BaOH/CaOH, 20 mmtetraethylammonium hydroxide, 50 mm N-methyl-d-glucamine, 2 mm CsOH, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, with methanesulfonic acid. Ca2+ and Ba2+ current amplitudes were usually in the range of 1–5 μA, except for the α1C subunit expressed alone (70–250 nA) as reported by others (35Singer D. Biel M. Lotan I. Flockerzi V. Hofmann F. Dascal N. Science. 1991; 253: 1553-1557Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar). Expression of the α2δ subunit was sometimes performed but did not significantly modify either the kinetics of the two types of inactivation or the effects of overexpressing intracellular I-II and III-IV loops. All of the results mentioned here were obtained without α2δ. Currents were filtered and digitized using a DMA-Tecmar labmaster and subsequently stored on an IPC 486 personal computer by using version 6.02 of the pClamp software (Axon Instruments). Ba2+ or Ca2+ currents recorded during a typical test pulse from −80 mV to +10 mV of 2.5-s duration were well fitted using a biexponential function: i(t) = (A1*exp(−(t − K)/Tau1) +A2 * exp(−(t −K)/Tau2)) + C, where t is the time; K is the zero time; A1, A2,Tau1, and Tau2 are the amplitudes and time constants of the two exponential components; and C is the fraction of noninactivating current. Current amplitudes and inactivation time constants were measured using Clampfit (pClamp version 6.02, Axon Instruments). Pseudo-steady state inactivation (2.5 s of conditioning depolarization) and current-voltage curves were fitted using the equationsI/I max = R + (1 −R)/(1 + exp((V −V 0.5)/k)) (for the inactivation curve) and I/I max = g * (V − E rev)/(1 + exp((V − V 0.5)/k)) (for the current-voltage curve), where g is a normalized conductance, E rev is the extrapolated reversal potential for barium, k is the slope factor,V 0.5 is the potential for half-inactivation or activation, V is the conditioning depolarization (inactivation curve) or the membrane potential used to record current (current-voltage curve), and R is the proportion of noninactivating current. All values are presented as mean ± S.D. Student's t test was used at the 0.05 confidence level to test the significance of the difference between two means. When expressed in Xenopus oocytes, each class of Ca2+ channels displays only one type of inactivation, which can be driven either by membrane potential or change in intracellular Ca2+ concentration (Fig. 1,A and B). Current kinetics of the α1A, α1B and α1ECa2+ channel, co-expressed with the ancillary Ca2+ channel β1 or β2 subunits, were identical using either Ca2+ or Ba2+ as charge carriers, as shown by the superimposed scaled traces seen in Fig. 1, A andB. These kinetics were only modulated by the amplitude of the depolarization, as expected for a voltage-dependent inactivation (not shown) (41De Waard M. Campbell K.P. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1995; 485: 619-634Crossref Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 54Sather W.A. Tanabe T. Zhang J.F. Tsien R.W. Ann. N. Y. Acad.

In contrast, Ca2+currents recorded from oocytes injected with the α1Csubunit inactivated markedly faster than the corresponding Ba2+ currents (Fig. 1 A). This behavior, typical of the so-called Ca2+-dependent mechanism of inactivation (13Charnet P. Bourinet E. Dubel S.J. Snutch T.P. Nargeot J. FEBS Lett. 1994; 344: 87-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 56Hadley R.W. Lederer W.J. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1991; 444: 257-268Crossref Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 57Shirokov R. Levis R.

(Lond.). 1989; 412: 197-220Crossref Scopus (90) Google Scholar), was present whether the β1 or the β2 subunit was co-expressed. Despite differences in their initiating events, voltage- and Ca2+-dependent inactivations were nevertheless both sensitive to the co-expression of the ancillary β subunits. Co-expression of the α1A subunit with the β1 or β2 subunit, for example, led to fast or slowly decaying Ba2+ currents, respectively (Fig.1 C, left). These differences in current kinetics were similar, in the case of the α1A subunit (but also α1B and α1E), using either 10 mm Ca2+ or Ba2+ as the charge carrier (see Fig. 1, A and B). Fast and slowly inactivating Ca2+ currents were also recorded upon co-expression of the β1 or β2 subunit with the α1C subunit (Fig. 1 C, right). In this case, however, the use of 10 mm Ba2+ as the charge carrier completely blocked current inactivation for these two subunit combinations, further demonstrating the absolute requirement of Ca2+ for α1C inactivation (Fig. 1, A and B). To understand the molecular mechanisms underlying these two different types of inactivation, the α1A and α1C subunits were chosen as prototype Ca2+ channels with pure voltage and Ca2+-dependent inactivations, respectively. Averaged data using long depolarizations and extended to the co-expression of the four known β subunits with these two α1 subunits are shown in Fig.2. When compared with the corresponding α1 subunit expressed alone, voltage- and Ca2+-dependent inactivations were significantly accelerated upon co-expression of the β1 subunits (Fig.2, α1A (top left) and α1C (top right); p< 0.05). The same effect was found upon co-expression of the β3 or β4 subunit, without significant difference when compared with α1A plus β1. Co-expression of the β2 subunit, however, slowed both the voltage and the Ca2+-dependent inactivation when expressed with the α1A or the α1Csubunit, respectively (significantly different from α1Aplus β1). A kinetic analysis of these current decays confirmed and extended this observation. Voltage- as well as Ca2+-dependent inactivation could be well approximated by a biexponential decay. The fast time constant (Tau1, Fig. 2) of inactivation of the α1A or α1C subunits was always accelerated upon co-expression of each of the β subunits (no statistical differences between the four β subunits). The slow time constant (Tau2, Fig. 2) was either decreased (β1, β3, and β4) or increased (β2), for these two α1 subunits, after co-expression of a β subunit, and it was thus responsible for the marked slowing of inactivation recorded with the β2 subunit (together with an increase in the relative amplitude of the slow component in both cases; not shown). Taken together, these data demonstrate that β subunits modified the same kinetic components of the voltage- and Ca2+-dependent inactivations and thus suggest that they affect the same molecular processes on the two α1 subunits. Because protein-protein interactions between the α1 and the β subunits are the basis of these regulations (8Sather W.A. Tanabe T. Zhang J.F. Mori Y. Adams M.E. Tsien R.W.

Because they play an important role in a number of disease states including chronic and acute inflammation, the selectins have been targeted for the identification of specific, high-affinity inhibitors as potential therapeutic agents (5Simanek E.E.

Moreover, the selectins function by a unique mechanism; they mediate the rolling of leukocytes under conditions of shear stress (8Springer T.A.

The molecular mechanisms that govern the rolling process are only beginning to be elucidated, and the majority of studies addressing selectin recognition have been conducted under static conditions. Little is known, therefore, about the structural features required for effective inhibitors of selectin-mediated rolling.

Structural studies suggest that glycoprotein ligands that interact with E-selectin (cutaneous lymphocyte antigen, ESL-1,1 PSGL-1) (11Steegmaier M. Levinovitz A. Isenmann S. Borges E. Lenter M.

Glycobiology. 1997; 7: 305-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). One of the best characterized of the physiological selectin ligands is the L-selectin ligand GlyCAM-1. The glycoprotein GlyCAM-1, which is secreted from endothelial cells in high endothelial venules (HEV), is a mucin: a heavily O-glycosylated, extended polypeptide that presents saccharide recognition elements extending from core-2 oligosaccharide structures. GlyCAM-1 displays the major saccharide capping groups 6-sulfo sialyl Lewis x (6-sulfo sLex 2) and 6′-sulfo sialyl Lewis x (6′-sulfo sLex 3) (25Hemmerich S. Leffler H. Rosen S.D. J. Biol.

The identification of these tetrasaccharide capping groups combined with the known requirement for sulfation of GlyCAM-1 (30Imai Y. Lasky L.A. Rosen S.D. Nature. 1993; 361: 555-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar) led to the hypothesis that sulfation at the 6- or 6′-position of sLex might confer recognition specificity for L-selectin. Thus, the extensive characterization of the saccharide chains of this protein has provided a structural basis from which to search for high-affinity, specific L-selectin inhibitors. The difficulties of defining the saccharide recognition epitope for a particular selectin are exemplified by studies of the interaction of L-selectin with various carbohydrate ligands. Attempts to elucidate the relevant saccharide element for L-selectin binding have produced conflicting reports that suggest either 6′-sulfation or 6-sulfation or perhaps both modifications of the sLex core are critical (31Mitsuoka C.

Antibodies uniquely reactive with 6-sulfo sLexinhibit L-selectin binding to HEV (31Mitsuoka C. Kawakami-Kimura N. Kasugi-Sawada M. Hiraiwa N. Toda K. Ishida H. Kiso M. Hasegawa A. Kannagi R. Biochem.

Lawson A.M. Komba S. Ishida H. Kiso M. Feizi T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 240: 748-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). In addition, a direct comparison of the disulfated Lexderivatives 3′,6′-disulfo Lex(Glc) 4 and 3′,6-disulfo Lex(Glc) 5(Fig. 2 A) revealed that5 is a superior inhibitor of L-selectin binding to GlyCAM-1 (34Sanders W.J. Katsumoto T.R. Bertozzi C.R. Rosen S.D. Kiessling L.L. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 14862-14867Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The conclusions from these studies, however, have been inferred from data obtained in static binding assays, which do not incorporate the conditions of shear stress under which selectin-ligand interactions take place. The multivalent display of saccharide-based recognition epitopes on GlyCAM-1 may provide additional features necessary for effective inhibition of L-selectin under physiological conditions. Several studies have addressed the importance of multivalent binding for high avidity interactions with L-selectin. For example, di- and tetravalent sLex analogs are superior inhibitors of L-selectin-mediated lymphocyte binding to HEV when compared with monovalent sLex (38Toppila S. Lauronen J. Mattila P.

Glycobiology. 1997; 7: 453-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In addition, sLex-containing acrylamide polymers are micromolar inhibitors of L-selectin binding to 3′-sulfo Lex ceramide (43Roy R. Park W.K.C. Srivastava O.P. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 1996; 6: 1399-1402Crossref Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Again, all of these studies utilized static binding assays to assess the efficacy of the inhibitors. To determine the relevant structural characteristics of L-selectin ligands, examination of the molecular requirements for L-selectin inhibition under conditions of shear stress may be necessary (10Konstantopoulos K. McIntire L.V. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 2661-2665Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). We set out to explore whether the apparent potencies of L-selectin inhibitors under static assay conditions were preserved under the more physiologically relevant conditions of shear stress. Leads for bioactive inhibitors are often inspired by the structures of the physiological ligands that bind the target of interest. The naturally occurring mucin-like L-selectin ligands present multivalent displays of L-selectin recognition elements on an extended polypeptide backbone (7Varki A. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 158-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). To mimic critical features of these mucins, we have developed a method for the synthesis of multivalent materials, termed neoglycopolymers, that display multiple saccharide epitopes (44Mortell K.H. Gingras M. Kiessling L.L. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1994; 116: 12053-12054Crossref Scopus (220) Google Scholar, 45Mortell K.H. Weatherman R.V. Kiessling L.L. J. Am. Chem.

Strong L.E. Hu X. Beck P.J. Kiessling L.L. Tetrahedron. 1997; 53: 11937-11952Crossref Scopus (92) Google Scholar). These materials, which are generated using the ring-opening metathesis polymerization (ROMP), share critical common features with natural L-selectin ligands; they present a multivalent display of saccharide recognition elements from an extended backbone (Fig. 2 B). The advantages of ROMP over other methods for synthesizing multivalent glycoprotein mimics are: 1) the assembly of the materials occurs in a single step from the monomer (44Mortell K.H. Gingras M. Kiessling L.L. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1994; 116: 12053-12054Crossref Scopus (220) Google Scholar, 45Mortell K.H. Weatherman R.V. Kiessling L.L. J. Am. Chem.

Strong L.E. Hu X. Beck P.J. Kiessling L.L. Tetrahedron. 1997; 53: 11937-11952Crossref Scopus (92) Google Scholar); 2) materials of defined length can be generated by varying the ratio of initiator to monomer (48Lynn D.M. Mohr B. Grubbs R.H. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1998; 120: 1627-1628Crossref Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 49Fraser C. Grubbs R.H. Macromolecules. 1995; 28: 7248-7255Crossref Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 50Kanai M. Mortell K.H.

Soc. 1996; 118: 784-790Crossref Scopus (285) Google Scholar); and 3) reporter groups can be appended to the resulting multivalent derivatives facilitating the monitoring of the biomolecular interaction. Here we report the synthesis and inhibitory properties of novel multivalent Lex-derived L-selectin ligands8 and 9, synthesized by ROMP, possessing either 6-sulfation or 6′-sulfation (Fig. 2 B). The activities of these ligands were assessed in both static and flow-based assays. Disulfated Lex trisaccharides4 and 5 were prepared and purified by protocols described previously (52Sanders W.J. Manning D.D. Koeller K.M. Kiessling L.L. Tetrahedron. 1997; 53: 16391-16422Crossref Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Sialyl Lewis x, methyl glycoside (Neu5Ac2-α-3Gal1-β-4(Fuc1-α-3)GlcNAc1-O-β-Me) was purchased from Toronto Research Chemicals, Inc. Detailed synthetic procedures for compounds 6–9 will be published elsewhere. Briefly, ROMP monomers 6 and7 were prepared by conjugation of 2-aminoethyl glycosides of the disulfated trisaccharides to (±)-bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene-exo-2-carboxylic acid pentafluorophenyl ester. Purification of the monomers by anion exchange chromatography (diethylaminoethyl-cellulose fast flow; 0→0.10m Et3NH2CO3) resulted in their isolation as bis-triethylammonium salts, which were used directly in the polymerization reactions. Monomer 6 (32.6 mg, 0.0321 mmol) or 7 (30 mg, 0.0296 mmol) and DTAB (6: 19.8 mg, 0.0642 mmol; 7: 15 mg, 0.0474 mmol) were dissolved in 100 mm pH 6.0 bis-Tris buffer (6: 0.214 ml buffer; 7: 0.200 ml buffer), which was deoxygenated by vigorous sparging of the solution with N2 for 2 h, under argon. To this mixture was added a solution of ruthenium carbene 10 (6: 1.8 mg, 0.00214 mmol; 7: 1.6 mg, 0.00198 mmol) in dichloroethane (6: 0.107 ml; 7: 0.100 ml, deoxygenated by five freeze-pump-thaw cycles), which resulted in a bright purple emulsion. This mixture was stirred vigorously at room temperature for 1 h, after which the emulsion turned from purple to light brown. The reaction was then heated to 60 °C and stirred for 14 h. Thin layer chromatography (TLC) analysis indicated mainly baseline material at this time (no monomer was visible). The mixture was cooled to room temperature, and excess ethyl vinyl ether (100 μL) was added. The reaction was exposed to air and stirred for 2 h, and methanol (100 μL) was added to produce a homogeneous solution. Purification of the polymer was conducted by the following steps: 1) size exclusion chromatography (Sephacryl S-200; 0.5 × 1.0 cm; eluting with 0.05m Et3NH2CO3) followed by concentration of the relevant fractions to dryness; 2) cation exchange chromatography (SP-Sephadex C-25; 0.5 × 2.0 cm; Na+) followed by concentration of the relevant fractions to dryness; 3) suspension of the resulting residue in methanol and centrifugation (3×); 4) dissolution of the residue in water followed by dialysis (500 molecular weight cut off in 1 liter of H2O; 2 × 24 h). Polymers 8 (19.5 mg, 71%) and 9 (21.3 mg, 84%) were isolated as brownish, flaky solids. Analysis by 1H NMR spectroscopy (500 MHz, D2O) indicated that n values of approximately 15 were obtained for each polymer as determined by comparison of integrals of the terminal phenyl group (5H per molecule) with integrals of the olefin and Fuc-H1 resonances (3H per monomer). These data suggest that the multivalent ligands 8 and 9 are composed of an average of 15 monomer units. Polymers 8 and9 were assayed for their ability to inhibit the binding of an L-selectin-IgG fusion protein to heparin, as described previously (53Revelle B.M. Scott D. Beck P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16160-16170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Briefly, serial dilutions of the test inhibitors were incubated with beads containing both goat IgG (for detection purposes) and an L-selectin-IgG chimeric protein in 96-well plates coated with heparin-albumin. The wells were sequentially washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and an anti-goat alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibody was added. The number of bound beads was determined by measuring the absorbance at 405 nm after addition of a standard alkaline phosphatase substrate. Polymers 8 and 9 were tested for their ability to inhibit rolling of L-selectin transfected cells on substrates coated with purified GlyCAM-1. The human L-selectin-transfected mouse pre-B cell line 300.19 (54Pavalko F.M. Walker D.M. Graham L. Goheen M. Doerschuk C.M. Kansas G.S. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 1155-1164Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar), a generous gift of Dr. G. S. Kansas (Northwestern University, Chicago, IL) was maintained in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mm glutamine, and 0.1 mm 2-mercaptoethanol. GlyCAM-1 purified from mouse serum was a generous gift from Dr. S. D. Rosen (University of California, San Francisco). For coating onto a substrate, GlyCAM-1 concentrate was diluted to a final concentration of 0.1 mg/ml in coating medium (PBS, supplemented with 20 mmbicarbonate, pH 8.5) and adsorbed onto a polystyrene plate at 37 °C for 2 h. Substrate was washed five times with PBS and blocked with 2% human serum albumin in PBS overnight at 4 °C. The polystyrene plate on which purified ligand was adsorbed was integrated into a parallel plate laminar flow chamber (260-mm gap), and the chamber was mounted on the stage of an inverted phase contrast microscope (Diaphot 300, Nikon Inc., Japan) as described previously (55Lawrence M.B. Berg E.L. Butcher E.C. Springer T.A. Eur. J. Immunol. 1995; 25: 1025-1031Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 56Lawrence M.B. Springer T.A. Cell. 1991; 65: 859-873Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1872) Google Scholar). Cells stored in H/H medium (Hank's buffered saline solution containing bovine serum albumin, 2 mg/ml, and 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4) at 4 °C were resuspended at densities of 106 cells/ml in binding medium (H/H medium supplemented with 2 mm Ca2+), brought to room temperature, and perfused through the flow chamber. Cellular interactions on two different fields of view (each one 0.17 mm2 of area) were visualized with a × 10 objective. Cell images were videotaped with a long integration LIS-700 charge-coupled device video camera (Applitech, Holon, Israel) and a Sony SLV E400 video recorder. Images were manually quantitated by analysis of played-back images directly from the monitor screen. Cells were perfused through the chamber at a flow rate generated with an automated syringe pump (Harvard Apparatus, Natick, MA) attached to the outlet side of the flow chamber. Cellular attachments to and subsequent rolling on the substrate were enumerated during 60 s of cell perfusion at a shear stress of 1.75 dyne/cm2. The attachments were expressed as a fraction of the flux of freely flowing cells that moved through the same field in close proximity with the substrate, as described previously (57Dwir O. Shimron F. Chen C. Singer M. Rosen S.D. Alon R. Cell. Adhes. Commun. 1998; 6: 349-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). More than 99% of the rolling events scored were ligand specific, as confirmed in parallel determinations on control substrates coated with human serum albumin. For inhibition studies, cells were mixed with mono- or multivalent saccharides, preincubated for 5 min in binding medium at room temperature, and then perfused without washing into the chamber. For comparing adhesive interactions in the presence of the various L-selectin blockers, identical fields of view were used to ensure that the results reflected uniform site density and distribution of the immobilized L-selectin ligand GlyCAM-1. The monovalent 3′,6′-disulfo Lex(Glc) and 3′,6-disulfo Lex(Glc) trisaccharides 4 and 5 were prepared by chemical synthesis as described previously (52Sanders W.J. Manning D.D. Koeller K.M. Kiessling L.L. Tetrahedron. 1997; 53: 16391-16422Crossref Scopus (41) Google Scholar). These trisaccharide derivatives were designed to act as mimics of 6′-sulfo sialyl Lewis x and 6-sulfo sLex, the major capping groups of GlyCAM-1. In previous studies, 3′,6-disulfo Lex(Glc), the analog of 6-sulfo sLex, was found to be a superior inhibitor of the L-selectin –GlyCAM-1 interaction in a static binding assay (34Sanders W.J. Katsumoto T.R. Bertozzi C.R. Rosen S.D. Kiessling L.L. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 14862-14867Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). To determine the influence of multivalent presentation on L-selectin recognition, we prepared displays of the trisaccharide epitopes of 4 and 5 to mimic the mode of saccharide residue presentation exhibited by naturally occurring L-selectin ligands, such as GlyCAM-1. These glycoprotein-inspired materials were assembled by a ring-opening metathesis polymerization (ROMP). To generate monomers that could be oligomerized in ROMP, intermediates in the synthesis of 4 and 5 were elaborated to possess anomeric substituents with free amino groups. The resulting compounds were appended to a bicyclic norbornene template through amide bond formation to yield compounds 6 and 7 as monomers for ROMP (Fig. 3). The template can be easily constructed (46Manning D.D. Hu X. Beck P. Kiessling L.L. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1997; 119: 3161-3162Crossref Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 47Manning D.D. Strong L.E. Hu X. Beck P.J. Kiessling L.L. Tetrahedron. 1997; 53: 11937-11952Crossref Scopus (92) Google Scholar), and it contains a strained alkene group, which facilitates the ROMP assembly reaction. To increase their solubility in the organic solutions required for initiator dissolution, the polar anionic monomers were converted to their triethylammonium salts. The glycoprotein analogs were prepared by oligomerization of compounds6 and 7 using the nonpolar initiator10 in an emulsion polymerization. The polymerization reactions were conducted in deoxygenated solutions composed of a mixture of dichloroethane, pH 6.0, bis-Tris buffer and the detergent DTAB. The reaction was found to proceed more rapidly and reliably under the slightly acidic reaction conditions, which is consistent with mechanistic data (48Lynn D.M. Mohr B. Grubbs R.H. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1998; 120: 1627-1628Crossref Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 58Dias E.L. Nguyen S.T. Grubbs R.H. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1997; 119: 3887-3897Crossref Scopus (680) Google Scholar). In these reactions, monomer-to-initiator stoichiometries of 15:1 were employed. For many ROMP reactions facilitated by defined metal carbene complexes, like 10, the monomer to initiator ratio controls the size of the products (59Ivin K.J. Mol J.C. Olefin Metathesis and Metathesis Polymerization. Academic Press, San Diego1997Google Scholar). Small amounts of unreacted monomer as well as other low molecular weight impurities could be separated from the water-soluble neoglycopolymers by size-exclusion chromatography. To remove the emulsifying agent and any other charged species and to generate materials with defined counterions, ion exchange chromatography and subsequent dialysis further purified the glycoprotein analogs8 and 9. Analysis by 1H NMR spectroscopy revealed the characteristic resonances expected for the saccharide units as well as those associated with the polymer backbone. These studies indicate that the sulfated saccharide units are stable to the polymerization conditions, as expected from our previous work (46Manning D.D. Hu X. Beck P. Kiessling L.L. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1997; 119: 3161-3162Crossref Scopus (171) Google Scholar,47Manning D.D. Strong L.E. Hu X. Beck P.J. Kiessling L.L. Tetrahedron. 1997; 53: 11937-11952Crossref Scopus (92) Google Scholar). NMR spectroscopic analysis indicated the purified products both contained an average of 15 monomer units per oligomer chain, which is the anticipated average length given the monomer to initiator ratio used. Trisaccharide 5 was previously shown to be 3-fold more effective than 4 at inhibiting L-selectin in a static, cell-free binding assay (34Sanders W.J. Katsumoto T.R. Bertozzi C.R. Rosen S.D. Kiessling L.L. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 14862-14867Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar).

The catalytically active recombinant enzyme expressed in COS cells phosphorylates the heptapeptide Kemptide (LRRASLG) with a specific activity of 1.5 μmol/(min·mg). Using surface plasmon resonance, high affinity interactions were demonstrated with the regulatory subunit type I (RIα) of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (K D = 10 nm) and the heat-stable protein kinase inhibitor (K D = 15 nm), but not with the type II regulatory subunit (RIIα, K D = 2.3 μm) under physiological conditions. Kemptide and autophosphorylation activities of PrKX are strongly inhibited by the RIα subunit and by protein kinase inhibitor in vitro, but only weakly by the RIIα subunit. The inhibition by the RIα subunit is reversed by addition of nanomolar concentrations of cAMP (K a = 40 nm), thus demonstrating that PrKX is a novel, type I cAMP-dependent protein kinase that is activated at lower cAMP concentrations than the holoenzyme with the Cαsubunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase. Microinjection data clearly indicate that the type I R subunit but not type II binds to PrKX in vivo, preventing the translocation of PrKX to the nucleus in the absence of cAMP. The RIIα subunit is an excellent substrate for PrKX and is phosphorylated in vitro in a cAMP-independent manner. We discuss how PrKX can modulate the cAMP-mediated signal transduction pathway by preferential binding to the RIα subunit and by phosphorylating the RIIα subunit in the absence of cAMP.

These multisubstrate enzymes regulate the activity of proteins involved in signal transduction, energy metabolism, cell proliferation, or differentiation by phosphorylation of Ser or Thr residues, which alters the biological properties of the target proteins (1Krebs E.G. Beavo J.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1979; 48: 923-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (1410) Google Scholar, 2Cho-Chung Y.S. Pepe S. Clair T. Budillon A. Nesterova M. Crit. Rev. Oncol.

The activation of a hormone receptor that is linked by a heterotrimeric G-protein complex to adenylate cyclase leads to an increase in the concentration of the second messenger cAMP. Binding of cAMP activates the inactive cAPK holoenzyme tetramer by inducing dissociation of two monomeric catalytic (C) subunits from the regulatory (R) subunit dimer. The active C subunits are now able to phosphorylate target proteins in the cytosol or can translocate to the nucleus, activating cAMP-mediated gene expression (4Harootunian A.T. Adams S.R. Wen W. Meinkoth J.L. Taylor S.S. Tsien R.Y. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 993-1002Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). The presence of different isoforms of catalytic (Cα, Cβ, and Cγ) and regulatory (RIα, RIβ, RIIα, and RIIβ) subunits suggests specific functions for these isoforms (5Doskeland S.O. Maronde E. Gjertsen B.T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1178: 249-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). However, preferential coexpression of any of these C subunits with either the type I or the type II R subunits has not been reported. The α and β isoforms of the catalytic subunit have nearly identical catalytic properties and a broad tissue distribution; Cα is generally the predominant form, whereas the Cγ subunit is only found in testis (6Beebe S. Oyen O. Sandberg M. Froysa A. Hansson V. Jahnsen T. Mol. Endocrinol. 1990; 4: 465-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). The two general isoforms of the R subunit, type I and type II, differ in molecular weight, tissue specificity, subcellular distribution, and expression pattern during development and cell cycle (2Cho-Chung Y.S. Pepe S. Clair T. Budillon A. Nesterova M. Crit. Rev. Oncol. Hematol. 1995; 21: 33-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The RI subunit is mainly found in the cytoplasm, whereas the RII subunit, which can bind to protein kinase A-anchoring proteins with high affinity, is localized in discrete particulate fractions in association with either membrane organelles or the cytoskeleton (7Faux M.C. Scott J.D. Cell. 1996; 85: 9-12Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). The RII subunits contain a Ser at their autoinhibitory site and are readily autophosphorylated upon holoenzyme formation. The phosphorylation of this residue lowers the reassociation rate of the phosphorylated RII subunit with the released C subunit at least 5-fold (8Rangel-Aldao R. Rosen O.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 3375-3380Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The decreased affinity prolongs the activation of the C subunit unless dephosphorylation of the RII subunit occurs (9Taylor S.S. Buechler J.A. Yonemoto W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1990; 59: 971-1005Crossref PubMed Scopus (956) Google Scholar). In contrast, the RIα subunit contains a pseudophosphorylation site, where the Ser is replaced by Ala and binds MgATP with high affinity (10Hofmann F. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 1559-1564Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Herberg F.W. Taylor S.S. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 14015-14022Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Another class of specific cAPK inhibitors are the heat-stable protein kinase inhibitors (PKIs) (12Walsh D.A. Angelos K.L. Van Patten S.M. Glass D.B. Garetto L.P. Kemp B.E. Peptides and Protein Phosphorylation. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1990: 43-84Google Scholar,13Van Patten S.M. Ng D.C. Th'ng J.P. Angelos K.L. Smith A.J. Walsh D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 5383-5387Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). These relatively small proteins bind with high affinity to the C subunit and favor the nuclear export, thereby blocking the cAMP response element-regulated gene expression (14Fantozzi D.A. Harootunian A.T. Wen W. Taylor S.S. Feramisco J.R. Tsien R.Y. Meinkoth J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2676-2686Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The human protein kinase PrKX is related to the catalytic subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinases (15Klink A. Schiebel K. Winkelmann M. Rao E. Horsthemke B. Ludecke H.J. Claussen U. Scherer G. Rappold G. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1995; 4: 869-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) but is distinct from the isoforms Cα, Cβ, and Cγ. PrKX has 53.2% identity to the human Cα subunit of cAPK (PKA-Cα) in the catalytic core region. This degree of homology is much lower than the similarity of the two human isoforms Cα and Cβ (90.5% identity). PrKX shows the highest sequence similarity to the DC2 protein kinase fromDrosophila melanogaster (62.4% identity). DC2 is a homologue of the major Drosophila catalytic subunit gene DC0 and can be inhibited by the heat-stable PKI and the regulatory subunit type I (16Melendez A. Li W. Kalderon D. Genetics. 1995; 141: 1507-1520Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The catalytic core of PrKX is highly conserved, whereas the N terminus, which is important for stability and orienting subdomains in PKA-Cα (17Herberg F.W. Zimmermann B. McGlone M. Taylor S.S. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 569-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), is completely different. PrKX mRNA is present in a variety of tissues, with the highest levels of expression in fetal and adult brain, kidney, and lung. Low levels of expression are also detected in adult placenta, heart, liver, skeletal muscle, and pancreas and in fetal liver (15Klink A. Schiebel K. Winkelmann M. Rao E. Horsthemke B. Ludecke H.J. Claussen U. Scherer G. Rappold G. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1995; 4: 869-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The gene PRKX is located on the human chromosomal subregion Xp22.3 and has a homologue calledPRKY on the Y chromosome. An abnormal interchange between the X and the Y chromosomes that happens particularly frequently between PRKX and PRKY leads to the sex reversal disorder of XX males and XY females (18Schiebel K. Winkelmann M. Mertz A. Xu X. Page D.C. Weil D. Petit C. Rappold G.A. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1997; 6: 1985-1989Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). This report focuses on the characterization of this novel protein kinase, PrKX, its interaction with known inhibitors of cAPK, and its regulation by the second messenger cAMP in vitro and in vivo. The cDNA for PrKX was isolated from a random primed HeLa cell library (19Chiorini J.A. Zimmermann B. Yang L. Smith R.H. Ahearn A. Herberg F.W. Kotin R.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5921-5929Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 20.Deleted in proof.Google Scholar). This cDNA differed from the original isolate described by Klink et al. (15Klink A. Schiebel K. Winkelmann M. Rao E. Horsthemke B. Ludecke H.J. Claussen U. Scherer G. Rappold G. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1995; 4: 869-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) by a Val to Ala substitution at position 42. To facilitate purification of the recombinant protein, an N-terminal His6 tag (MGSSHHHHHHSSG) was added to the full-length construct, which was ligated into the StuI andHindIII sites of the SV-Sport vector (Life Technologies, Inc.). High efficiency electroporation of this construct into COS cells resulted in overexpression of the PrKX protein. A GST-PrKX fusion protein was produced using the ESP yeast expression system inSchizosaccharomyces pombe (Stratagene). ASmaI/HindIII fragment was isolated from SVPrKX and cloned into the StuI/HindIII sites of the HTb shuttle vector (Life Technologies, Inc.), aBamHI/HindIII fragment was isolated, and theHindIII site was filled in with Escherichia coliDNA polymerase Klenow fragment. This fragment was cloned into theBamHI/SmaI sites of ESP. PrKX expressed in COS cells was purified using Ni-nitrilotriacetic acid affinity chromatography as described previously (19Chiorini J.A. Zimmermann B. Yang L. Smith R.H. Ahearn A. Herberg F.W. Kotin R.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5921-5929Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Fractions containing the highest concentration of PrKX as determined by Coomassie staining of SDS-polyacrylamide gels were pooled, dialyzed against storage buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.25% Nonidet P-40, 20% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol), and stored at −20 °C. GST-PrKX was overexpressed in S. pombe, purified using glutathione-agarose, and eluted with 10 mm glutathione (21Guan K.L. Dixon J.E. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 192: 262-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (1639) Google Scholar). Wild-type recombinant PKA-Cα was overexpressed in E. coli BL21.DE3 and purified by phosphocellulose chromatography as described previously (22Yonemoto W.M. McGlone M.L. Slice L.W. Taylor S.S. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 200: 581-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The fractions were further purified using Mono S chromatography (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) (23Herberg F.W. Bell S.M. Taylor S.S. Protein Eng. 1993; 6: 771-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Recombinant RIα and RIIα subunits were overexpressed in E. coli222, purified as described previously (24Saraswat L.D. Filutowicz M. Taylor S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 11091-11096Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and stored at −20 °C. To obtain cAMP-free R subunit, the R subunit was unfolded with 8m urea and refolded as described by Buechler et al. (25Buechler Y.J. Herberg F.W. Taylor S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16495-16503Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Protein purity was checked by SDS-PAGE (26Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207012) Google Scholar). GST-PKI was overexpressed in E. coli BL21.DE3, purified using glutathione-agarose, and eluted with 10 mm glutathione (21Guan K.L. Dixon J.E. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 192: 262-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (1639) Google Scholar). The specific activity was determined using the spectrophotometric assay of Cook et al. (27Cook P.F. Neville M.E. Vrana K.E. Hartl F.T. Roskoski J.R. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 5794-5799Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar) and the heptapeptide Kemptide (LRRASLG, Bachem) as substrate. The standard assay was performed at 22 °C in Buffer C (100 mm MOPS, pH 7.0, 1 mm ATP, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol) with 250 μm Kemptide. Alternatively, activity was measured by a modified radioactive assay according to Roskoski (28Roskoski Jr., R. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 99: 3-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar) using Buffer D (20 mm MOPS, pH 7.0, 50 mm KCl, 1 mm ATP, 10 mmMgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol) at 30 °C. TheK m values for ATP and Kemptide were determined based on Michaelis-Menten kinetics, and data evaluation was performed using the software GraphPad Prism. The effect of the free Mg2+concentration on PrKX activity was examined using varying concentrations of Mg2+ and constant amounts of ATP and substrate. The free Mg2+ concentrations were calculated using the software Bound and Determined based on equations provided by Brooks and Storey (29Brooks S.P.J. Storey K.B. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 201: 119-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). The heat denaturation studies were performed according to Yonemoto et al. (30Yonemoto W. McGlone M.L. Taylor S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2348-2352Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 1.2 μm PrKX was incubated in Buffer D with [γ-32P]ATP at 30 °C for 60 min. The inhibition of autophosphorylation was tested by adding a 2-fold molar excess of cAMP-free RIα or RIIα subunit in either the absence or presence of 20 μm cAMP; adding a 2-fold molar excess of GST-PKI or 20 mm EDTA; or heating PrKX at 60 °C for 5 min prior to the incubation. The autophosphorylation was stopped by adding SDS sample buffer. The samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. 60 nm PrKX was incubated with increasing amounts of GST-PKI and tested for activity with the spectrophotometric assay in Buffer C at 22 °C. TheK i values were determined using the equation of Cheng and Prusoff (31Cheng Y. Prusoff W.H. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1973; 22: 3099-3108Crossref PubMed Scopus (12266) Google Scholar) based on K D values determined by surface plasmon resonance (SPR). For inhibition studies with the regulatory subunits, 100 nm PrKX was incubated with increasing amounts of either cAMP-free RIα subunit or RIIα subunit in Buffer C at 22 °C and tested for Kemptide phosphorylation activity with the spectrophotometric assay. Holoenzyme at a concentration of 5 nm formed by mixing PKA-Cα or PrKX and cAMP-free RIαsubunit in a 1:1.2 molar ratio in Buffer D was incubated for 2 min at room temperature with varying concentrations of cAMP between 1 nm and 2.5 μm. The reaction was started by adding 1 mm Kemptide, and the resulting phosphotransferase activity was measured using the radioactive assay. SPR experiments were performed using a Biacore 2000 instrument (Biacore AB, Uppsala, Sweden). Here, the interaction between an immobilized component, referred to as the ligand, and a molecule in the mobile phase, the analyte, was determined. Changes in surface concentration are proportional to changes in the refractive index on the surface resulting in changes in the SPR signal, plotted as response units (RU). 1000 RU correspond to a surface concentration of 1 ng/mm2 (32Stenberg E. Persson B. Roos H. Urbaniczky C. J. Colloid Interface Sci. 1991; 143: 513-526Crossref Scopus (1005) Google Scholar). The association and dissociation of cAMP-free RIα was determined on a surface containing 580 RU of GST-PrKX immobilized via an αGST antibody at a flow rate of 30 μl/min in Buffer H. To determine the interaction between PKI and PrKX, 160 RU of GST-PKI were immobilized using the αGST antibody surface, whereas for the interaction with PKA-Cα the immobilization level was reduced to 60–75 RU. A lower immobilization level of the ligand avoids rebinding effects in the dissociation phase that can arise due to fast on-rates. The regeneration of the antibody surface, i.e. the removal of the complete protein complex bound to the antibody, was performed using 10 mm glycine (pH 2.2) or 0.05% SDS and resulted in a completely regenerated and functional antibody surface. For the measurement of the interaction between PrKX or PKA-Cα and the RIIαsubunit, the C subunits were covalently coupled to a CM5 chip via primary amines (300 RU of His6-PrKX and 475 RU of PKA-Cα) as described (33Herberg F.W. Dostmann W.R. Zorn M. Davis S.J. Taylor S.S. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7485-7494Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), and the cAMP free RIIα subunit was injected at a flow rate of 10 μl/min in Buffer G or Buffer H. All buffers used contained 0.005% surfactant P20. The regeneration of the surface was performed in Buffer G with 100 μm cAMP and 2.5 mm EDTA. To determine unspecific binding, blank runs were performed on a control surface without ligand, and these values were subtracted. Kinetic constants were calculated by nonlinear regression of data using the Biaevaluation software, version 2.1 or 3.0 (Biacore). The association rate constant was calculated according to the equation, R=kaCRmax/(kaC+kd)·(1−e−(kaC+kd)t)Equation 1 where R is the SPR signal in response units,k a is the association rate constant,k d is the dissociation rate constant, andC is the concentration of the injected analyte at any timet during association. This equation describes the response at any time during association and can be used for nonlinear regression analysis of single curves. The dissociation rate constant was calculated according to the equation, Rt=R0e−kd(t−t0)Equation 2 where R t is the response at timet, and R 0 is the time at an arbitrary starting point t 0. With the rate constants determined and known analyte concentrations, the equilibrium binding constants were calculated according to the following equation. KD=kd/kaEquation 3 A 1:1 binding model assuming Langmuir conditions was applied to the data. The phosphorylation of RIIα (2 μm) by catalytic amounts of PrKX or PKA-Cα (2.4 nm) was performed with the radioactive assay at 30 °C. Aliquots of the phosphorylated RIIα subunit were spotted onto phosphocellulose filters, washed three times in 0.5%o-phosphoric acid for 10 min, and counted using a liquid scintillation counter. In parallel, aliquots were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. Prephosphorylation of RIIα (2 μm ) was performed with catalytic amounts of either PKA-Cα or PrKX (2.4 nm) in Buffer D using unlabeled ATP (1 mm). At certain time points, [γ-32P]ATP and the other kinase, PrKX or PKA-Cα, in the same concentration were added to the sample. The effect of prephosphorylation on 32P incorporation was demonstrated by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. 10T1/2 mouse embryo fibroblasts were propagated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum to 50% confluence and then microinjected with plasmids encoding HA-tagged PrKX and the mutant regulatory subunits RI(R209K) and RII(R213K), which are deficient in their response to cAMP. To show the effect of cAMP, cells were treated for 15 min with 1 mmdibutyryl-cAMP before fixing the cells. Cells were fixed after 6 h with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 10 min, washed twice with PBS, and permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS for 15 min. The reaction with the primary antibody was performed for 1 h at 37 °C with monoclonal antibody against HA (BABCO) at a dilution of 1:200 in PBS containing 0.5% Nonidet P-40 and 5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. The cells were then washed twice with PBS for 5 min at room temperature before the secondary antibody reaction with a rhodamine-labeled donkey anti-mouse antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch) at 1:200 dilution for 45 min at 37 °C. Injected cells were photographed with a Zeiss Axiophot fluorescence microscope under a × 63 oil immersion lens. The expression of PrKX in eukaryotic cells (COS cells,S. pombe) yielded catalytically active protein kinase, which was used for the characterization. Initial preparations of PrKX overexpressed in bacteria were inactive and copurified with the bacterial chaperon GroEl. Inactivity and association with the chaperon most likely indicates folding problems, possibly due to a lack of posttranslational modifications, i.e. phosphorylation (34Adams J.A. McGlone M.L. Gibson R. Taylor S.S. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 2447-2454Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Purification of PrKX was simplified by using fusion constructs with either an N-terminal His6 tag that can easily be purified with Ni-NTA affinity chromatography or a GST fusion tag (Fig.1 A). A wash step with cAMP (1 mm) was included in the purification strategy due to cross-contamination with endogenous PKA-Cα from COS cells, which was initially detected by Western blot analysis with a specific antibody against PKA-Cα and by using mass spectrometry. 2B. Zimmermann and F. W. Herberg, unpublished observations. After this wash step, no contamination with endogenous PKA-Cα could be detected by Western blot analysis (Fig. 1 B). The specific activity of PrKX determined either by the coupled spectrophotometric assay (27Cook P.F. Neville M.E. Vrana K.E. Hartl F.T. Roskoski J.R. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 5794-5799Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar) or the more sensitive radioactive assay using the cAPK standard substrate Kemptide was 1.5 ± 0.7 μmol/(min·mg), 20-fold less than the specific activity for PKA-Cα. TheK m values for ATP (127 ± 9 μm) and Kemptide (58 ± 7 μm) were significantly higher compared with the wild-type or the His6-tagged PKA-Cα (Table I). PrKX phosphotransferase activity had an absolute requirement for Mg2+. PrKX displayed the highest activity at micromolar concentrations of free Mg2+, whereas higher concentrations of free Mg2+ had inhibitory effects on PrKX activity (Fig.2 A). PrKX was also autophosphorylated. Autophosphorylation was inhibited by the addition of EDTA (see Fig. 4), chelating the Mg2+. This result further confirmed the absolute requirement for Mg2+. Heat denaturation experiments were performed to determine the thermal stability of PrKX and yielded Tm values of 41.8 ± 0.2 °C for PrKX and 45.3 ± 0.2 °C for PKA-Cα(Fig. 2 B). Thus, the thermostability of PrKX is only slightly reduced and comparable to PKA-Cα.Table IKinetic properties of His6-tagged PrKX, wild-type and His6-tagged PKA-CαSpecific activityK mATPK m Kemptideunits/mgμmμmHis6-PrKX1.5 ± 0.7127 ± 958 ± 7Wild-type PKA-Cα30 ± 217 ± 520 ± 8His6-PKA-Cα30 ± 314 ± 620S.E. values are given using at least three different preparations.

Data were fit assuming Michaelis-Menten conditions. The effects of physiological inhibitors of PKA-Cα (the RIα subunit, the RIIα subunit, and PKI) on PrKX were investigated. Both binding of these inhibitors and inhibition of phosphotransferase activity were quantified using different methods. The autophosphorylation of PrKX (Fig. 3) was significantly but not completely inhibited by a 2-fold molar excess of cAMP-free RIα subunit or GST-PKI. In contrast, the addition of a 2-fold molar excess of cAMP-free RIIαsubunit did not have any effect on PrKX autophosphorylation whether cAMP was present or not. Phosphotransferase activity of PrKX using Kemptide as substrate was significantly inhibited by both GST-PKI and the RIα subunit (Fig. 4,A and B). A 2-fold molar excess of PKI or RIα subunit inhibited 80% (K i = 7 nm) or 95% (K i = 1 nm) of this activity, respectively. Initial slopes of the inhibition curves indicated 1:1 stoichiometry. However, a 2-fold molar excess of RIIαsubunit did not lead to a detectable decrease of phosphotransferase activity (Fig. 4 B). Addition of a 25-fold molar excess of RIIα subunit was necessary to cause a 40% inhibition, suggesting a much weaker inhibition by the RIIα subunit in the presence of ATP. This partial inhibition by the RIIα subunit could also be reversed by cAMP (Fig.4 C). The inhibition of PrKX activity by the RIα subunit of cAPK could be reversed by the addition of cAMP, as demonstrated in the autophosphorylation experiment (Fig. 3). To further examine the activation by cAMP, the PrKX/RIαholoenzyme was incubated with varying concentrations of this second messenger, and phosphorylation of Kemptide was determined. The activation constant (K a) for the PrKX/RIα holoenzyme is 43 nm (Fig.4 D), which is 2.5-fold lower compared with theK a for the PKA-Cα/RIαholoenzyme (109 nm). Hill coefficients of the activation constants constants are 2 and 2.4 for PKA-Cα/RIα and PrKX/RIα, respectively, suggesting a cooperative activation of both holoenzymes. To demonstrate the interaction between PrKX and its physiological inhibitors, SPR was employed. With this method, association and dissociation rate constants were directly determined, and the binding behavior of the inhibitors of cAPK, the RIα subunit, the RIIα subunit, and PKI was further defined. The interaction between PrKX and the RIαsubunit was examined using amine-coupled His6-tagged PrKX or GST-PrKX, immobilized on an αGST antibody surface. As an analyte, the cAMP-free RIα subunit was injected in the presence of 1 mm ATP/10 mm MgCl2 (Fig.5). Regeneration of the surface was performed with cAMP. The equilibrium binding constants (K D) for the His6-tagged and GST-PrKX were 5.4 and 4.9 nm, respectively, which suggests that the different fusion tags do not influence the affinity to the RIα subunit. However, the association and the dissociation rate constants were affected slightly (TableII). Comparable rate constants for the interaction between RIα subunit and either amine-coupled His6-tagged or wild-type PKA-Cα ind"

The signaling pathways via which these effects are mediated are not fully understood. We have shown previously that GM-CSF treatment of human neutrophils activates the Janus kinase/signal transducers and activators of transcription (Jak/STAT) pathway and, more specifically, Jak2, STAT3, and STAT5B in neutrophils. GM-CSF also stimulates the activity of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-kinase) in a tyrosine kinase-dependent manner. Here we report that pretreating the cells with a Jak2 inhibitor (AG-490) abolishes tyrosine phosphorylation of the p85 subunit of PI3-kinase induced by GM-CSF. Furthermore, p85 was found to associate with Jak2, but not with Lyn, in stimulated cells in situ and with its autophosphorylated form in vitro; however, Jak2 did not bind to either of the two Src homology 2 (SH2) domains of the p85 subunit of PI3-kinase. Although STAT5B bound to the carboxyl-terminal SH2 domain of p85, it was absent from the complex containing PI3-kinase and Jak2. These results suggest that stimulation of the activity of PI3-kinase induced by GM-CSF is mediated by Jak2 and that the association between Jak2 and p85 depends on an adaptor protein yet to be identified.

They play, among others, a critical role in the nonspecific immune response. Several cytokines regulate the differentiation as well as the activity of neutrophils (1Smith J.A. J.

Among these is granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF),1 a glycoprotein released by several cell types which supervises the maturation process of granulocyte and monocyte progenitors (5Gasson J.C.

In addition, several of the biological activities of mature neutrophils are also regulated by GM-CSF, which acts mainly by priming these cells and making them more responsive to secondary stimuli. For example, superoxide production (7Atkinson Y.H. Lopez A.F. Marasco W.A. Lucas C.M. Wong G.G. Burns G.F. Vadas M.A. Immunology. 1988; 64: 519-525PubMed Google Scholar, 8Lopez A.F. Williamson D.J.

In addition, a number of direct effects of GM-CSF on neutrophils have been reported. These include the stimulated synthesis of interleukin (IL)-1 and IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra) (10Clark S. Int. J. Cell Cloning. 1988; 6: 365-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), increases in the surface expression of adhesion molecules of the β2 integrin family (17Sha'afi R.I. Molski T.F.P. Prog. Allergy. 1988; 42: 1-64PubMed Google Scholar), in the number as well as the affinity of fMLP receptors (7Atkinson Y.H. Lopez A.F. Marasco W.A. Lucas C.M. Wong G.G. Burns G.F.

Although most of these activities have been well documented, the signaling mechanisms that underlay them are still poorly understood. The GM-CSF receptor is made up of two subunits, termed α and β (19Rapoport A.P. Abboud C.N. DiPersio J.F. Blood Rev. 1992; 6: 43-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). The α subunit binds GM-CSF with low affinity, and only in presence of the β subunit is high affinity binding achieved (20Hayashida K. Kitamura T. Gorman D.M. Arai K.-I. Yokota T. Miyajima A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 9655-9659Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar). Because of its short cytoplasmic tail, the α subunit was originally believed to play little role in signaling (19Rapoport A.P. Abboud C.N. DiPersio J.F. Blood Rev. 1992; 6: 43-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 21Polotskaya A. Zhao Y.M. Lilly M.L. Kraft A.S. Cell Growth Differ. 1993; 4: 523-531PubMed Google Scholar). This, however, is being challenged by recent reports suggesting its involvement in regulating cell growth (22Matsuguchi T. Zhao Y. Lilly M.B. Kraft A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17450-17459Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 23Muto A. Watanabe S. Itoh T. Miyajima A. Yokota T. Arai K. J. Allerg. Clin. Immunol. 1995; 96: 1100-1114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The β subunit, on the other hand, has a long intracytoplasmic tail and plays a major role in transmitting the signal inside the cell (24Sakamaki K. Miyajima I. Kitamura T. Miyajima A. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3541-3549Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). Neither subunit has intrinsic enzymatic activity, nor are they known to link to G proteins directly (19Rapoport A.P. Abboud C.N. DiPersio J.F. Blood Rev. 1992; 6: 43-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Signaling by the GM-CSF receptor depends on the activation of the tyrosine phosphorylation pathways mediated by the stimulation of a number of cytosolic protein tyrosine kinases (25Quelle F.W.

Each of these kinases is involved in the signaling pathways associated with various cytokines (25Quelle F.W. Sato N. Witthuhn B.S. Inhorn R.C. Eder M. Miyajima A. Griffin J.D. Ihle J.N. Mol. Cell.

Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7271-7275Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). For example, Jak2 will associate with and phosphorylate the β subunit of the GM-CSF receptor upon ligand binding in TF-1 cells (25Quelle F.W. Sato N. Witthuhn B.S. Inhorn R.C. Eder M. Miyajima A. Griffin J.D. Ihle J.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4335-4341Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The Jak family functions upstream of a family of transcription factors called STATs (signal transducers and activators of transcription) (35Ihle J.N. Kerr I.M. Trends Genet. 1995; 11: 69-74Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (820) Google Scholar,36Ihle J.N. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond.-Biol. Sci. 1996; 351: 159-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Eight different STATs have been identified so far (STAT1 α and β, STAT2–4, STAT5A and B, and STAT6). The STATs are activated by tyrosine phosphorylation (37Pellegrini S. Dusanter-Fourt I. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 248: 615-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar) and in some cases by an additional serine phosphorylation (38Wen Z. Zhong Z. Darnell J.E. Cell. 1995; 82: 241-250Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1735) Google Scholar). The phosphorylated STATs will form homo- as well as heterodimers and migrate to the nucleus where they bind specific DNA motifs (35Ihle J.N. Kerr I.M. Trends Genet. 1995; 11: 69-74Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (820) Google Scholar, 36Ihle J.N. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond.-Biol.

Which members of the Jak and STAT family are activated varies greatly among different agonists and for the same agonist but in different cell systems (29Brizzi M.F. Aronica M.G. Rosso A. Bagnara G.P.

In neutrophils, we have shown that GM-CSF treatment induces the selective activation of Jak2, STAT3, and STAT5B (44Al-Shami A. Mahana W. Naccache P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1058-1063Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Another effector system activated by GM-CSF involves phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-kinase) (26Corey S. Eguinoa A. Puyanatheall K. Bolen J.B. Cantley L. Mollinedo F. Jackson T.R. Hawkins P.T. Stephens L.R. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2681-2690Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). This enzyme phosphorylates the third hydroxyl group of the inositol ring. In vitro, it uses phosphatidylinositol (PtdIns), phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PtdIns-4-P), and phosphatidylinositol 4,5-diphosphate (PtdIns-4,5-P2) as substrates leading to the production of PtdIns-3-P, PtdIns-3,4-P2, and PtdIns-3,4,5-P3, respectively (45Liscovitch M.

Biol. 1998; 9: 153-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). In vivo, however, only the levels of PtdIns-3,4-P2 and PtdIns-3,4,5-P3 are modulated by PI3-kinase upon stimulation, whereas the levels of PtdIns-3-P remain unchanged (47Zhang X.L. Majerus P.W. Semin. Cell. Dev. Biol. 1998; 9: 153-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). PI3-kinase has been implicated in regulating cell proliferation (48Powis G. Phil D. Cancer Metastasis Rev. 1994; 13: 91-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), protein secretion (49Yano H. Nakanishi S. Kimura K. Hanai N. Saitoh Y. Fukui Y. Nonomura Y. Matsuda Y. J. Biol.

In addition, the products catalyzed by the activation of PI3-kinase, namely PtdIns-3,4-P2 and PtdIns-3,4,5-P3, serve as cofactors for several members of the calcium-insensitive protein kinase C family (51Toker A.

The α, β, and δ are made up of a dimer containing a p85 regulatory subunit and a p110 catalytic subunit (56Domin J. Waterfield M.D. FEBS Lett. 1997; 410: 91-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 57Vanhaesebroeck B. Leevers S.J. Panayotou G. Waterfield M.D. Trends Biochem.

PI3-kinase γ is made up of a p110 catalytic subunit and a p101 regulatory subunit apparently activated by G-protein-linked receptors (31Al-Shami A. Bourgoin S.G. Naccache P.H. Blood. 1997; 89: 1035-1044Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 59Stephens L.R. Eguinoa A. Erdjumentbromage H. Lui M. Cooke F. Coadwell J. Smrcka A.S. Thelen M. Cadwallader K. Tempst P. Hawkins P.T. Cell. 1997; 89: 105-114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar). We have shown that GM-CSF treatment significantly activated PI3-kinase α in human neutrophils and that this activation is mediated by tyrosine kinases (31Al-Shami A. Bourgoin S.G. Naccache P.H. Blood. 1997; 89: 1035-1044Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the identity of the kinases involved remains elusive. The aim of this report was to examine the potential interrelationships between the Jak/STAT and PI3-kinase pathways during the stimulation of human neutrophils by GM-CSF. The results presented show that inhibition of the tyrosine kinase activity of Jak2 abolished the GM-CSF-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of the p85 subunit of PI3-kinase associated with it. In addition, the p85 subunit was found to associate with Jak2 upon stimulation with GM-CSF in situ as well as with autophosphorylated Jak2 in vitro. Finally, STAT5B but not STAT3 associated with the carboxyl SH2 domain of p85 in cellular lysates of cells treated with GM-CSF. GM-CSF was generously provided by the Genetics Institute (Cambridge, MA). Nonidet P-40 was obtained from Sigma. Sephadex G-10, protein A, dextran T-500, and Ficoll-Paque were purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. The monoclonal antiphosphotyrosine antibody UB 05-321, the agarose-conjugated antiphosphotyrosine antibodies, the polyclonal anti-Jak2 (06-255) and anti-PI3-kinase (06-195) antibodies as well as purified Jak2 (14-134) were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). Polyclonal antibodies to Lyn (sc-15), STAT3 (sc-482), and STAT5B (sc-835) were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc (Santa Cruz, Ca). The GST fusion proteins carrying the SH2 domains of the p85 subunit of PI3-kinase were a generous gift from Dr. Tony Pawson (Samuel Lunenfeld Research Institute, Mount Sinai Hospital, Toronto, Ontario, Canada). The enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) Western blotting system was obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Blood was collected from healthy adult volunteers into heparinized tubes. The cells were centrifuged for 10 min at 1,000 rpm to remove platelet-rich plasma. After 2% dextran sedimentation of erythrocytes for 30 min, neutrophils were purified under sterile conditions by centrifugation on Ficoll-Paque cushions. Contaminating erythrocytes were removed by hypotonic lysis, and the cells were suspended in magnesium-free Hanks' balanced salt solution containing 1.6 mm CaCl2 at a final count of 40 × 106 cells/ml. The entire procedure was carried out in sterile conditions at room temperature. The final cell preparation comprised at least 97% neutrophils and less than 0.2% monocytes. Neutrophil suspensions (1 ml of 40 × 106 cells/ml) were either stimulated with 4 nm GM-CSF or treated with the same volume of the diluent (0.01% bovine serum albumin) for the indicated periods of time at 37 °C. For lysates prepared under reducing conditions (60Al-Shami A. Gilbert C. Barabé F. Gaudry M. Naccache P.H. J. Immunol. Methods. 1997; 202: 183-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), 500 μl of the cell suspensions was added to equal amounts of denaturing buffer A containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mmNaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaF, 2 mmNaVO4, 20 mm NaP2O4, 10 μg/ml leupeptin,10 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μm pepstatin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1% SDS, and 0.6% β-mercaptoethanol (final concentrations) preheated to 100 °C, and incubated for 10 min. The lysates were centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 10 min at room temperature. The supernatants were then filtered through Sephadex G-10 columns to remove the denaturing agents. To prepare the columns, 3 g of Sephadex/sample was suspended in 10 ml of buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 5 mm EDTA, 5 mm EGTA, and 137 mm NaCl (final concentrations) for at least 3 h at room temperature with occasional shaking before use. Nonidet P-40 (1%) and bovine serum albumin (0.1 mg/ml) were added to the eluates which were subsequently used for immunoprecipitation. Lysates (1 ml) obtained as described above were incubated with 10 μg of agarose-conjugated antiphosphotyrosine antibodies or agarose-conjugated SH2 domains of the p85 subunit of PI3-kinase for 5 h at 4 °C with constant rotation. The beads were collected by centrifugation and washed twice with modified buffer A containing 1% Nonidet P-40 but no SDS or β-mercaptoethanol and twice with LiCl buffer (0.5 m LiCl, 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4). The supernatants were removed carefully, 45 μl of 2 × boiling Laemmli buffer (1 × is 62.5 mTris-HCl, pH 6.8, 4% SDS, 5% β-mercaptoethanol, 8.5% glycerol, 2.5 mm NaVO4, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 0.025% bromphenol blue) was then added, and the samples were boiled for 10 min before being used for electrophoresis. For nondenaturing lysis, buffers containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 137 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 25 mm NaF, 2 mm NaVO4, 1 μm pepstatin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1% Nonidet P-40 (final concentrations) were used. The lysed cells were incubated on ice for 10 min before centrifugation at 12,000 rpm for 20 min. A preclearing with protein A-Sepharose for 30 min at 4 °C was carried out. The lysates were transferred carefully to new tubes and used for subsequent immunoprecipitation with anti-Jak2 and anti-Lyn antibodies for 2 h at 4 °C. 20 μg of protein A-Sepharose was added next, and the tubes were left at 4 °C for 1 h. The beads were then washed twice with lysis buffer and twice with LiCl buffer (0.5 mLiCl, 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4). Agarose-conjugated purified Jak2 was suspended in kinase buffer containing 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 1 mmMgCl2, 1 mm MnCl2, 25 mm NaCl, and 0.1 mm NaVO4 for 40 min at 30 °C with or without 1 mm ATP. The enzyme (10 μg) was washed with phosphate-buffered saline and incubated with 1 ml of cellular lysates taken from untreated neutrophils that were prepared under native conditions as described above. The mixture was left at 4 °C for 2 h before being washed twice with LiCl buffer (0.5m LiCl, 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4). Neutrophils (4 × 106 cells/ml) were treated with 200 μm AG-490 or diluent (dimethyl sulfoxide) for 90 min at 37 °C. The assay to measure the activity of PI3-kinase was conducted as described previously (61Gold M.R. Duronio V. Saxena S.P. Schrader J.W. Aebersold R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5403-5412Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, PI3-kinase was immunoprecipitated by adding 4 μg of anti-p85 antibodies to 900 μl of nondenatured precleared lysates and left at 4 °C for 2 h. The antibodies were collected after a 1-h incubation at 4 °C with protein A-Sepharose. The immunoprecipitates were washed once with each of the following: lysis buffer, LiCl buffer (0.5 m LiCl, 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4), EDTA buffer (1 mmEDTA, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4), and kinase buffer without ATP (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm MnCl2, 5 mm MgCl2). The immunoprecipitates were suspended in 50 μl of kinase buffer containing 300 μg/ml phosphatidylinositol substrate and 10 μCi of [32P]ATP. The reactions were allowed to proceed for 90 s before being quenched with 80 μl of 1 n HCl. The lipids were extracted by the addition of 200 μl of chloroform/methanol (1:1 v/v ratio) and separated on thin layer chromatography plates precoated with ammonium oxalate. The migration solution contained 2-propanol and 2 m acetic acid at a 2:1 v/v ratio. The phosphorylated lipids were revealed by autoradiography. The specificity of PI3-kinase activity was confirmed by its inhibition in the presence of either 20 nm wortmannin or 2.5% Nonidet P-40. Samples were electrophoresed on 7.5–20% SDS-polyacrylamide gradient gels. Electrophoretic transfer cells (Hoefer Scientific Instruments, Canberra Packard, Ontario, Canada) were used to transfer proteins from the gels to Immobilon polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore Corporation, Bedford, MA). Immunoblotting was performed as described previously (34Tanaka N. Asao H. Ohbo K. Ishii N. Takeshita T. Nakamura M. Sasaki H. Sugamura K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7271-7275Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Briefly, nonspecific sites were blocked using 2% gelatin in TBS-Tween (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 190 mm NaCl, 0.15% Tween 20) for 1 h at 37 °C. The first immunoblot was carried out with the indicated antibodies that were incubated with the membranes for 1 h at 37 °C at a final dilution of 1/4,000 in fresh blocking solution. The membranes were washed three times at room temperature in TBS-Tween for a total duration of 30 min and then incubated with horseradish peroxidase-labeled secondary antibodies for 1 h at 37 °C at a final dilution of 1/20,000 in fresh blocking solution. The membranes were washed three times with TBS-Tween, and the protein bands were revealed using the ECL Western blotting detection system following the manufacturer's directions. To ensure the presence of equal amounts of immunoprecipitated proteins under each condition, the membranes were routinely reblotted with the respective immunoprecipitating antibody. Reprobing was conducted as follows. The polyvinylidene difluoride membranes were treated with TBS buffer containing 1% H2O2 for 5 min at room temperature. The membranes were washed extensively with TBS buffer containing no H2O2 and were then blotted with the immunoprecipitating antibodies as described above. The first experiment was designed to examine the effect of AG-490, a reportedly specific Jak2 inhibitor (62Meydan N. Grunberger T. Dadi H. Shahar M. Arpaia E. Lapidot Z. Steven Leeder J. Freedman M. Cohen A. Gazit A. Levitzki A. Roifman C.H. Nature. 1996; 379: 645-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (847) Google Scholar), on the pattern of tyrosine phosphorylation of cellular proteins induced by GM-CSF in human neutrophils. Cells at 4 × 106/ml were incubated with 200 μm AG-490 or its diluent (dimethyl sulfoxide) for 90 min at 37 °C. The cells were then suspended in Hanks' balanced salt solution at 40 × 106/ml and stimulated with 4 nm GM-CSF or diluent (0.01% BSA) for 10 min at 37 °C and subsequently added to an equal volume of boiling sample buffer. Cellular proteins were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, and immunoblotted with antiphosphotyrosine antibodies. As shown in Fig.1, GM-CSF induced tyrosine phosphorylation of a number of proteins in the 150–140-, 120-, 90-, 80-, 70-, 55-, and 40-kDa region (63Kanakura Y. Druker B. DiCarlo J. Cannistra S.A. Griffin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 490-495Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 64McColl S.R. DiPersio J.F. Caon A.C. Ho P. Naccache P.H. Blood. 1991; 78: 1842-1852Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Treating cells with AG-490 led to a decrease in the level of tyrosine phosphorylation of most of these proteins especially those with molecular masses in the 140-, 120-, 90-, 80-, and 40-kDa ranges (indicated by arrows). AG-490 was used at 200 μm, a concentration that provided the optimal inhibition of Jak2 within 90 min of preincubation without affecting the survival of the cells as evidenced from testing by trypan blue (data not shown). In addition, neutrophils pretreated with AG-490 were responsive to treatment with IL-8 and fMLP, two agonists that utilize G-protein-linked receptors (data not shown). The inhibitory effects of AG-490 were time- and concentration-dependent. Shorter incubation times (30–60 min) or lower concentrations (50, 100, 150 μm) inhibited progressively less the tyrosine phosphorylation stimulated by GM-CSF (data not shown). We have shown previously that the stimulation of human neutrophils by GM-CSF induced tyrosine phosphorylation of the p85 subunit and activation of PI3-kinase (31Al-Shami A. Bourgoin S.G. Naccache P.H. Blood. 1997; 89: 1035-1044Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We examined next the effect of AG-490 on these two parameters. Cells were incubated with AG-490 as described above and treated with 4 nm GM-CSF or diluent for 15 min at 37 °C. The"
https://openalex.org/W2115353208,"The nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (AChR) and the serotonin type 3 receptor (5HT3R) are members of the ligand-gated ion channel gene family. Both receptors are inhibited by nanomolar concentrations of d-tubocurarine (curare) in a competitive fashion. Chemical labeling studies on the AChR have identified tryptophan residues on the γ (γTrp-55) and δ (δTrp-57) subunits that interact with curare.

Site-directed mutagenesis at position Trp-89 markedly reduces the affinity of the 5HT3R for the antagonists curare and granisetron but has little effect on the affinity for the agonist serotonin. To further examine the role of this region of the receptor in ligand-receptor interactions, alanine-scanning mutagenesis analysis of the region centered on Trp-89 (Thr-85 to Trp-94) was carried out, and the ligand binding properties of the mutant receptors were determined. Within this region of the receptor, curare affinity is reduced by substitution only at Trp-89, whereas serotonin affinity is reduced only by substitution at Arg-91. On the other hand, granisetron affinity is reduced by substitutions at Trp-89, Arg-91, and Tyr-93. This differential effect of substitutions on ligand affinity suggests that different ligands may have different points of interaction within the ligand-binding pocket. In addition, the every-other-residue periodicity of the effects on granisetron affinity strongly suggests that this region of the ligand-binding site of the 5HT3R (and by inference, other members of the ligand-gated ion channel family) is in a β-strand conformation.

Akabas M.H. Neuron. 1995; 15: 1231-1244Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar, 2Ortells M.O. Lunt G.C. Trends Neurosci. 1995; 18: 121-127Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar, 3Unwin N. Neuron. 1993; 10: 31-41Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Like the other members of the gene superfamily, the 5HT3R exhibits a large degree of sequence similarity, and thus presumably structural homology, with the AChR (4Maricq A.V. Peterson A.S. Brake A.J. Myers R.M. Julius D. Science. 1991; 254: 432-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (884) Google Scholar). Chimeras containing the amino-terminal domain of the α7 neuronal AChR and the carboxyl-terminal domain of the 5HT3R form functional ligand-gated channels with ligand specificities characteristic of AChR and permeability properties of 5HT3Rs (5Eisele J.-L. Bertrand S. Galzi J.-L. Devillers-Thiery A. Changeux J.-P. Bertrand D. Nature. 1993; 366: 479-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). These experiments suggest that the AChR and 5HT3R have quite similar structures and signal transduction mechanisms. A large number of studies have been conducted to elucidate the structure of the ligand-binding site for AChRs (6Devillers-Thiery A. Galzi J.L. Eisele J.L. Bertrand S. Bertrand D. Changeux J.P. J. Membr. Biol. 1993; 136: 97-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 7Karlin A. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1993; 3: 299-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar); however, very little is known about the interactions between ligands and the 5HT3R. A common competitive antagonist of the AChR and 5HT3R is d-tubocurarine (curare), which inhibits both receptors at nanomolar concentrations (8Peters J.A. Malone H.M. Lambert J.J. Neurosci. Lett. 1990; 110: 107-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 9Yan D. Pedersen S.E. White M.M. Neuropharmacology. 1998; 37: 251-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). If both receptors are similar in structure, it seems reasonable to assume that similar regions of the receptors may be involved in curare binding. Affinity labeling studies using the Torpedo electroplax AChR have identified two tryptophan residues, one on the γ (γTrp-55) and the other on the δ (δTrp-57) subunit, as being involved in curare-AChR interactions (10Chiara D.C. Middleton R.E. Cohen J.B. FEBS Lett. 1998; 423: 223-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Mutagenesis data are consistent with γTrp-55 contributing to the high affinity curare-binding site (11O'Leary M.E. Filatov G.N. White M.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: C648-C653Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which is known to exist at the α-γ subunit interface (12Pedersen S.E. Cohen J.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 2785-2789Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar, 13Blount P. Merlie J.P. Neuron. 1989; 3: 349-357Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Comparison of the deduced amino acid sequences of this region of a number of members of the gene superfamily shows that tryptophan is found in this position in the AChR γ (γTrp-55) and δ (δTrp-57) subunits and the 5HT3R (position Trp-89) but not most other receptors (Fig. 1). In support of the notion that Trp-89 may contribute to the curare-binding site of 5HT3Rs, chemical modification studies have suggested that one or more tryptophan residues contribute to the binding of a number of 5HT3R ligands (14Miquel M.C. Emerit M.B. Gozlan H. Hamon M. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1991; 42: 1453-1461Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). To determine the role of Trp-89 in ligand-5HT3R interactions, we have carried out an alanine scan mutational analysis (15Cunningham B.C. Wells J.A. Science. 1989; 244: 1081-1085Crossref PubMed Scopus (1088) Google Scholar) of the region around Trp-89. We have identified several residues in this region that play a role in ligand-receptor interactions and have further identified residues that may make differential contributions to agonist and antagonist binding. Furthermore, the periodicity of the effects of the mutations on ligand affinity suggests that this particular region of the ligand-binding domain is in a β-strand conformation. A pair of oligonucleotides (GCCTACTACTGTCTCCATTGA and CTCCCACTCGCCCTGATTTAT) derived from the published sequence of the original 5HT3R cDNA (4Maricq A.V. Peterson A.S. Brake A.J. Myers R.M. Julius D. Science. 1991; 254: 432-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (884) Google Scholar) was used to amplify a 460-base pair fragment from RNA isolated from the murine neuroblastoma line NIE-115 using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RNA polymerase chain reaction kit, P/E/Express). The fragment was then used to screen a plasmid cDNA library made from N1E-115 mRNA. A full-length cDNA clone corresponding to the 5HT3RAs form (16Hope A.G. Downie D.L. Sutherland L. Lambert J.J. Peters J.A. Burchell B. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1993; 245: 187-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) was isolated and subcloned into vector pCI (Promega, Madison, WI). Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using the QuickChange system (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). All mutants were verified through sequence analysis. Because the amino terminus of the mature protein is unknown, the amino acid numbering system used here includes the signal sequence and has the initial methionine as position 1. Protein secondary structure analysis was carried out using the Chou-Fasman (17Chou P.Y. Fasman G.D. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1978; 47: 45-148PubMed Google Scholar) and Garnier-Robson (18Garnier J. Osguthorpe D.J. Robson B. J. Mol. Biol. 1978; 120: 97-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (3418) Google Scholar) algorithms contained in a commercially available software package (Lasergene, DNAStar, Inc., Madison, WI). Cultures of the tsA201 cell line, a derivative of the widely used HEK 293 cell line, were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 units/ml streptomycin. Cultures at 30–40% confluence were transfected with 20 μg of 5HT3R cDNA/100-mm dish using the calcium phosphate technique. After 12-h exposure to the DNA/calcium phosphate solution, the medium was replaced with fresh medium, and the cells were allowed to grow for another 24–36 h prior to use. Maximal expression was obtained 36–72 h after transfection. Transfected cells were scraped from the dishes, washed once with phosphate-buffered saline and resuspended and homogenized in 2.5 ml of 154 mm NaCl, 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, per 100-mm dish. The homogenate was then used in binding assays or frozen until needed. We observed no change in either ligand affinity or B max values after freezing. Membranes were incubated for 2 h at 37 °C in a total volume of 0.5 ml of 154 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing the appropriate concentrations of the competing ligand and radioligand ([3H]granisetron; NEN Life Science Products, 85 Ci/mmol). Binding was terminated by rapid vacuum filtration onto GF/B filters that had been pretreated in 0.2% polyethyleneimine in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and the filters were washed with cold 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4. Nonspecific binding was defined as that binding not displaced by 100 μm m-chlorophenyl biguanide. K d values for [3H]granisetron were determined by fitting the saturation binding data to Equation 1 using a Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm in a commercially available software package (Igor Pro, WaveMetrics, Oswego, OR), B=Bmax1+(Kd/[L])Equation 1 where B is the amount of [3H]granisetron specifically bound at concentration [L], B max is the maximal binding at saturation, and K d is the dissociation constant. IC50 values for various inhibitors were determined by fitting the data to Equation 2, θ=1+[I]IC50−1Equation 2 where θ is the fractional amount of [3H]granisetron bound in the presence of the inhibitor at concentration [I] compared with that in the absence of inhibitor and IC50 is the concentration of inhibitor at which θ= 0.5.K i values were calculated from the IC50values using the Cheng-Prusoff relation (19Cheng Y. Prusoff W.H. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1973; 22: 3099-3108Crossref PubMed Scopus (12292) Google Scholar) (Equation 3), Ki=IC501+([L]/Kd)Equation 3 where [L] is the concentration of [3H]granisetron used to determine the IC50value in the experiment and K d is the dissociation constant for [3H]granisetron. Transfected cells were transferred to 35-mm dishes containing 140 mm NaCl, 1.7 mmMgCl2, 5 mm KCl, 1.8 mmCaCl2, 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, and currents elicited by bath application of agonists at a holding potential of −70 mV were measured in the whole-cell configuration (20Hamill O.P. Marty A. Neher E. Sakmann B. Sigworth F.J. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1981; 391: 85-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (15145) Google Scholar) with an Axopatch 200A amplifier (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA) under computer control using custom programs written in AxoBasic. Patch electrodes contained 145 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, and had resistances of 3–5 megaohms. Agonist and antagonists were dissolved in extracellular solution and delivered to the cell by means of a fast perfusion system (Warner Instruments, Hamden, CT). For experiments involving inhibition of 5-HT-elicited currents by curare, cells were perfused with the desired concentration of curare for 2 min before switching to a solution containing 5-HT and curare. Dose-response curves from individual cells were normalized to the maximum current and were fit to Equation 4 as described previously (21O'Leary M.E. White M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8360-8365Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), θ=1+EC50[A]n−1Equation 4 where θ is the normalized current at 5-HT concentration [A], EC50 is the concentration of 5-HT required to obtain half-maximal current, and n is the apparent Hill coefficient. Our initial focus was on Trp-89, which is in the homologous position to the two tryptophan residues in the Torpedo AChR that are photolabeled by curare, γTrp-55 and δTrp-57 (10Chiara D.C. Middleton R.E. Cohen J.B. FEBS Lett. 1998; 423: 223-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Initially, Trp-89 was replaced by alanine, which should have little effect on α-helical or β-sheet structure and thus should produce little structural perturbation. However, we were unable to elicit whole cell currents with 5-HT concentrations up to 10 mm from cells transfected with W89A receptors nor were we able to detect specific binding of the antagonist [3H]granisetron in membranes prepared form transfected cells (data not shown). Obviously, substitution of Trp-89 with alanine either interfered with the proper assembly or the functioning of the receptor. We then replaced tryptophan with another aromatic amino acid, phenylalanine, which should represent a less severe substitution. Fig.2 shows 5-HT-elicited currents recorded from cells transfected with either wild type (Fig. 2, left) or W89F (Fig. 2, right). Although the activation properties of the two receptors are essentially identical (TableI), the sensitivity to the competitive antagonist curare was markedly different. Wild type receptors were inhibited 85% by 10 nm curare, whereas W89F receptors were inhibited less than 15% under the same conditions.Table IProperties of wild type and W89F 5HT3RsWild typeW89FLigand binding affinitiesGranisetron1.3 ± 0.1 nm10.9 ± 2.9 nmCurare138 ± 22 nm1063 ± 179 nmSerotonin164 ± 62 nm215 ± 30 nmChannel activationSerotonin EC502.4 ± 0.1 μm2.4 ± 0.1 μmHill coefficient2.21.9Ligand affinities of both wild type and W89F receptors were determined using either saturation isotherms for [3H]granisetron (for granisetron) or competition assays (for curare and serotonin) as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Channel activation parameters were determined using the responses to bath-applied serotonin as described under “Experimental Procedures.” In both cases, each parameter was obtained using 3–5 determinations at each concentration, and errors represent the error estimates returned by the fitting routine. Open table in a new tab Ligand affinities of both wild type and W89F receptors were determined using either saturation isotherms for [3H]granisetron (for granisetron) or competition assays (for curare and serotonin) as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Channel activation parameters were determined using the responses to bath-applied serotonin as described under “Experimental Procedures.” In both cases, each parameter was obtained using 3–5 determinations at each concentration, and errors represent the error estimates returned by the fitting routine. This reduction in curare sensitivity is also seen in ligand binding studies. Saturation binding isotherms for the competitive antagonist [3H]granisetron were determined for both wild type and W89F receptors (Fig. 3 A). TheB max value for wild type receptors was on the order of 2–4 pmol/mg of protein, whereas that of the W89F receptors was 1–2 pmol/mg of protein (data not shown). The expression levels of wild type receptors are 5–10 times that reported for N1E-115 neuroblastoma cells (22Lummis S.C.R. Sepuveda M. Kilpatrick G.J. Baker J. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1993; 243: 7-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) or transiently transfected COS-1 (4Maricq A.V. Peterson A.S. Brake A.J. Myers R.M. Julius D. Science. 1991; 254: 432-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (884) Google Scholar) cells. The affinity of the W89F receptors for [3H]granisetron was markedly reduced compared with wild type (K d = 10.9 ± 2.9 nm (W89F) versus 1.3 ± 0.1 nm (wild type)). We examined the effects of the W89F mutation on the affinity of other agonists and antagonists through the use of analysis of the reduction in [3H]granisetron binding in the presence of increasing concentrations of agonists and antagonists. Inhibition of [3H]granisetron binding by curare to wild type and W89F receptors showed a similar reduction in ligand affinity in the mutant (Fig. 3 B). The K i for curare inhibition in wild type receptors was 138 ± 22 nm, whereas the value for W89F receptors was 1063 ± 179 nm, a reduction in affinity comparable with that seen in the [3H]granisetron saturation binding isotherms. A similar reduction in affinity was also observed for another 5HT3R antagonist, MDL-72222 (data not shown). In all three cases, the W89F mutation results in a reduction of ligand affinity. However, when agonists were used in the competition studies, a different picture emerges. No significant difference in affinity between mutant and wild type receptors was observed for the full agonist serotonin (Fig.3 C) or the partial agonists phenylbiguanide orm-chlorophenylbiguanide (data not shown). The serotonin data are consistent with the electrophysiological assays in which no difference in the activation parameters was observed between wild type and W89F receptors. The above findings suggest that Trp-89 interacts specifically with antagonists but not with agonists. To explore this in more detail, alanine-scanning mutagenesis (15Cunningham B.C. Wells J.A. Science. 1989; 244: 1081-1085Crossref PubMed Scopus (1088) Google Scholar) of this region of the receptor was carried out. In this approach, functionally important residues are identified by sequential replacement of residues within a specific region with alanine. Alanine is used as the replacement because it eliminates the side chain beyond the β-carbon yet, unlike glycine, generally does not alter main chain conformation. We carried out the analysis on nine residues flanking Trp-89 (Thr-85 to Trp-94) using [3H]granisetron, curare, and serotonin as the ligands to examine the properties of the binding site. All nine alanine-substituted receptors were expressed on the cell surface and formed 5HT3Rs. The receptor density (determined as theB max values for [3H]granisetron binding) of the mutant receptors ranged from 0.1 pmol/mg (Q92A) to 2.2 pmol/mg (T86A). The results of the alanine scan in terms of ligand affinities are presented in Fig. 4. Each of the three ligands shows a distinct profile. For example, the only substitution that significantly affects the interaction of curare with the receptor is W89F; all other replacements in this region have little effect on affinity. In the case of the agonist serotonin, the only substitution that alters the affinity of the receptor is R91A. Finally, the affinity of [3H]granisetron is reduced by substitutions at both Trp-89 and Arg-91, as well as by a third, Y93A. These results suggest that whereas this region of the receptor is clearly involved in ligand binding, each of these three structurally different ligands interacts in a slightly different fashion with the ligand-binding domain of the receptor. These differences, in turn, can provide some information on some of the structural features of the receptor. Previous studies have suggested the involvement of tryptophan residues in ligand binding in both the AChR (10Chiara D.C. Middleton R.E. Cohen J.B. FEBS Lett. 1998; 423: 223-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 11O'Leary M.E. Filatov G.N. White M.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: C648-C653Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and the 5HT3R (14Miquel M.C. Emerit M.B. Gozlan H. Hamon M. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1991; 42: 1453-1461Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The data presented in this study demonstrate that Trp-89, which is in the same homologous position as the two tryptophan residues in the AChR that interact with curare (γTrp-55, δTrp-57), plays an important role in curare-5HT3R interactions. The fact that this is a region in the 5HT3R homologous to a domain known to be involved in ligand binding in the AChR lends support to the notion that similar regions in the two receptors are involved in ligand binding. The data presented in this study suggest that although the region around Trp-89 in the 5HT3R is clearly involved in ligand binding, the specific interactions of various compounds with the binding site may be different. In particular, the fact that in the region Thr-85 to Trp-94 substitution at Trp-89 affects curare, but not serotonin, affinity indicates that there are differential interactions between the binding site and the ligands. This is presumably because of differences in ligand structure and/or positioning within the binding site. In addition to the notion that the “fine structure” of ligand-receptor interactions may differ for different ligands, our data also provide some insight into the structure of the binding site itself. Unlike curare and serotonin, whose binding is sensitive to mutations at only one residue, the affinity of the antagonist granisetron is affected by mutations at three different residues in this region (Trp-89, Arg-91, Tyr-93). The fact that the relevant positions are in an every-other-residue pattern suggests very strongly that this region of the receptor is in a β-strand conformation. In support of this hypothesis, secondary structure predictions using the Chou-Fasman (17Chou P.Y. Fasman G.D. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1978; 47: 45-148PubMed Google Scholar) and Garnier-Robson (18Garnier J. Osguthorpe D.J. Robson B. J. Mol. Biol. 1978; 120: 97-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (3418) Google Scholar) algorithms predict that this region of the protein should exist in a β-sheet structure. This aspect of the study demonstrates the power of the alanine scan mutagenesis approach, which can pick up structural features that a more focused single-residue mutagenesis approach might miss. Tsigelny et al. (23Tsigelny I. Sugiyama N. Sine S.M. Taylor P. Biophys. J. 1997; 73: 52-66Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) have described a model for the extracellular domain of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor that is based on sequence similarity to copper-binding proteins of known crystal structure. The region homologous to the domain that we have studied (residues 51–60 in their numbering system) was modeled as an α-helical structure by these authors. However, this region was in one of the four insertions that had to be introduced into the backbone of the copper-binding protein scaffold, and their assignment was based on the fact that in their hands the Chou-Fasman indicates a favorable environment for α-helical structure. In our secondary structure analysis, we did notice that the Chou-Fasman algorithm predicted an α-helical structure for several small stretches in this region of the 5HT3R but that the helical prediction was weaker than that for a β-strand, which extended through the entire region. Furthermore, an alternate prediction algorithm, the Garnier-Robson method, did not predict any α-helical structure in this region but did predict a β-strand structure. In addition, our own analysis of this particular region of the AChR using the Chou-Fasman and Garnier-Robson algorithms indicated that this particular region of the γ and δ subunits of the AChR should be in the β-strand, not α-helical, configuration. In any case, we feel that our experimental data strongly favor a β-strand structure for this region of the 5HT3R and, on homology grounds, in all other members of the family, including the AChR. The data presented here are consistent with the notion that there is a significant amount of structural and functional homology between the AChR and 5HT3R (and by inference, the other members of the ligand-gated ion channel family). Changeux and co-workers (6Devillers-Thiery A. Galzi J.L. Eisele J.L. Bertrand S. Bertrand D. Changeux J.P. J. Membr. Biol. 1993; 136: 97-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar) have proposed that the ligand-binding domain of the AChR is formed by several distinct regions of the α and non-α subunits. We envision that the ligand-binding domain of the 5HT3R is also formed by several different parts of the extracellular domain that are homologous to those regions of the AChR known to be involved in ligand binding. The present study has focused on one of these regions, and the data indicate that this notion that homologous regions are involved in ligand binding is indeed correct. The expansion of our studies to the other regions of 5HT3R that are homologous to the ligand-binding domains of the AChR will allow us to test the notion that the functional homology of the members of the ligand-gated ion channel family extends to a fairly resolved level. Given the success of our initial foray, as well as our findings concerning the secondary structure of a portion of the binding site, we envision this as a somewhat reciprocating process, in which information obtained from one member of the gene family can be used to guide the studies on another, and vice versa."

Calphostin C-induced apoptosis was associated with synchronous down-regulation of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL as well as activation of caspase-3 but not caspase-1. The exposure to calphostin C led to activation of stress-activated protein kinase/c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (SAPK/JNK) and p38 kinase and concurrent inhibition of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK).

Apoptosis is induced in human gliomas by exposure to calphostin C, a specific inhibitor of PKC, and calphostin C-induced apoptosis was preceded by down-regulation of bcl-2 mRNA and protein (29Ikemoto H. Tani E. Matsumoto T. Nakano A. Furuyama J. J. Neurosurg. 1995; 83: 1008-1016Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Overproduction of Bcl-2 can render cells more resistant to induction of apoptosis by a wide variety of stimuli (30Reed J.C. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (2389) Google Scholar), and Bcl-2 appears to work both upstream and downstream of the caspase cascade to prevent effects of caspases (31Hengartner M.O. Nature. 1998; 391: 441-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). To characterize the molecular mechanism that regulates calphostin C-induced apoptosis of gliomas, the contributions of mitogen-activated protein kinase family members to cell death caused by calphostin C-induced down-regulation of Bcl-2 are explored using various inhibitors of caspases, SAPK/JNK, and p38 kinase in this work. Two glioma cell lines (wild type p53-positive U-87MG and mutant p53-positive T98G obtained from the American Type Culture Collection, Rockville, MD) were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and antibiotics (100 units/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin) in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% air at 37 °C. Test exposures to 100 nm calphostin C were conducted in the continuous presence of light to promote photoactivation of this compound. Cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min after washing with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and then stained with 2.5 μg/ml Hoechst 33258. The number of apoptotic cells was assessed by nuclei staining, and nuclei that were fragmented or condensed were scored as apoptotic. The viability of cells was confirmed by the trypan blue or propidium iodide dye exclusion method. DNA was prepared from cells as described previously (29Ikemoto H. Tani E. Matsumoto T. Nakano A. Furuyama J. J. Neurosurg. 1995; 83: 1008-1016Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The resulting DNA preparation was analyzed by 1.5% agarose gel electrophoresis in TBE buffer (89 mmTris borate buffer, pH 8.0, 89 mm boric acid, 22 mm EDTA) containing 0.5 μg/ml ethidium bromide at 100 V/cm for 30 min. The DNA fragmentation pattern was examined on photographs taken under UV illumination. Cells were lysed on ice in lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl at pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA, 50 μg/ml leupeptin, 30 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and then centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 10 min. Equivalent amounts of cell lysates were heated in 2× sample buffer at 95 °C for 3 min and then electrophoresed in 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, except for immunoblotting of PARP in which 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel was used, and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. The membranes were incubated with primary antibody against Bcl-2 (6C8; Pharmingen, San Diego, CA), Bax (Mobio, Nagoya, Japan), Bcl-x (Transduction, Lexington, KY), p10 subunit of caspase-1 (C-20; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), p12 subunit of caspase-3 (K19; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), PARP (C-2-10; a kind gift from Dr. Guy G. Poirier, CHUL Research Center, Quebec, Canada), or Raf1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology); washed; and blotted with species-specific biotinylated secondary antibodies (Vector, Burlingame, CA) and then with horseradish peroxidase-streptavidin (Vector). The membrane was then developed in ECL reagent (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and exposed to x-ray film. The osmotic lysis of pinosome method as described by Moore et al. (32Moore M.W. Carbone F.R. Bevan M.J. Cell. 1988; 54: 777-785Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (954) Google Scholar) was used to enhance uptake of the inhibitor peptides into the cells. Briefly, cells were incubated for 8–10 min at 37 °C with 500 μl of a prewarmed hypertonic solution of 0.5 m sucrose, 10% (v/v) polyethylene glycol 1000, 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.0) in DMEM containing 100 μmAc-YVAD.cho or 100 μm Ac-DEVD.cho. Hypotonic medium (60% DMEM, 40% distilled water) was added to a final volume of 15 ml, and incubation at 37 °C continued for 10 min. The hypotonic medium was changed into DMEM, 10% fetal calf serum. Calphostin C was added to the culture medium, and the mixture was incubated for the indicated times, followed by agarose electrophoresis. Cells were lysed on ice in lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES at pH 7.5, 0.5% Triton X-100, 100 mm NaF, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 4 mm EDTA, 2 mm Na3VO4, 2 mm Na2MoO4, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). After centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, supernatants were absorbed with Affi-Gel protein A (Bio-Rad)-normal rabbit serum complex for 90 min at 4 °C and then incubated with Affi-Gel protein A-polyclonal anti-human Shc antibody (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY) complex, which had been treated in advance with 20 mm dimethyl pimelimidate in 0.2m sodium borate for cross-linking. The immunoprecipitates were boiled for 5 min in 2× sample buffer, subjected to 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, which was then blocked with 1% gelatin in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween 20 overnight and probed with mouse monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (Upstate Biotechnology) for 1 h. The secondary antibody was horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (Dako, Glostrup, Denmark), and proteins were detected using the ECL system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The membranes were also immunologically reprobed with anti-human Shc antibody after stripping each of the primary antibodies off the membranes. Cells were lysed on ice in lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl at pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 2.5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). After centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C and boiling in 2× sample buffer for 5 min, cell lysates for in gel MBP kinase assay for ERK were electrophoresed in 11% SDS-polyacrylamide gel containing 0.5 mg/ml MBP fragment. SDS was removed from the gel using 20% propanol. The gel was washed in 50 mm Tris-HCl at pH 8.0, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol and thereafter denatured with 6 m guanidine; renatured in 50 mm Tris-HCl at pH 8.0 containing 5 mmβ-mercaptoethanol and 0.04% Tween 40; and incubated with kinase buffer (48 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 25 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, 30 μm ATP, 6 mmMgCl2, 2.4 mm dithiothreitol, 0.12 mm EGTA) at room temperature for 1 h. After washing with 5% trichloroacetic acid and 1% pyrophosphate solution, the gel was dried, and kinase activity was visualized using FUJIX Bio-Imaging Analyzer BAS2000. Cell lysates for SAPK/JNK and p38 kinase assay were subjected to 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The membranes were blocked with Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20 and 5% nonfat dry milk for 1–3 h and separately incubated with anti-phosphospecific SAPK/JNK (Thr183/Tyr185) antibody (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) and anti-phosphospecific p38 kinase (Tyr182) antibody (New England Biolabs) overnight at 4 °C. The secondary antibody was horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG, and proteins were detected using the ECL system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Cell lysates were also separately probed with anti-ERK1/ERK2 antibody (Zymed Laboratories Inc., San Francisco, CA), anti-SAPK/JNK1 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), or anti-p38 kinase antibody (New England Biolabs). Cells were plated 24 h before transfection at a density of 105/18-mm cover glass. The cells were co-transfected with pcDL-SRα-SAPK-VPF plasmid expressing dominant-negative SAPK/JNK or pcDL-SRα-WT-SAPK plasmid expressing wild-type SAPK/JNK as a control, together with pEGFP-Vector (CLONTECH) using FuGENETM6 transfection reagent (Boehringer Mannheim) by following the manufacturer's instructions and/or were then treated with 100 μm SB203580 (33Cuenda A. Rouse J. Doza Y.N. Meier R. Cohen P. Gallagher T.F. Young P.R. Lee J.C. FEBS Lett. 1995; 364: 229-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (1981) Google Scholar), a specific inhibitor of p38 kinase, 15 min prior to exposure to calphostin C for 8 h in U-87MG cells and for 6 h in T98G cells. The cells, after washing three times with phosphate-buffered saline, were incubated for 3 min with 10 μm Hoechst 33258 or 10 μm propidium iodide and analyzed under an Olympus AX-80 fluorescence microscope. Dominant-negative and wild-type SAPK/JNK expression plasmids were obtained from Prof. E. Nishida (Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan). Glioma cells exposed to 100 nmcalphostin C showed an apoptotic morphology: cell shrinkage and surface blebbing by phase contrast images, and condensation or fragmentation of nuclei by Hoechst 33258 stain (Figs. 1and 11). Mutant p53-positive T98G cells appeared to become more quickly apoptotic than wild type p53-positive U-87MG cells, suggesting that calphostin C-induced apoptosis is p53-independent. Unambiguous electrophoretic patterns of laddered oligonucleosomal DNA fragments were observed as early as 8 h in U-87MG cells and 6 h in T98G cells following exposure to 100 nm calphostin C, as shown representatively in Fig. 2,lanes 2 and 7, respectively.Figure 11Effects of dominant negative SAPK/JNK and SB203580 on calphostin C-induced apoptotic phenotype, cell viability, and PARP cleavage.

The 19-kDa Bcl-xSwas not detected. Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL were down-regulated nearly synchronously as early as 2–4 h after treatment with 100 nm calphostin C in both U-87MG and T98G cells. In contrast, Bax levels in both U-87MG and T98G cells were not changed during treatment with calphostin C (Fig. 3). There was no evidence of caspase-1 activation following 100 nm calphostin C treatment, since immunoreactive active 10-kDa caspase-1 fragment was not detected in both U-87MG and T98G cells during treatment with calphostin C for 12 h (Fig.4). The levels of 45-kDa procaspase-1 remained unchanged during calphostin C treatment for the first 6 h and thereafter were decreased in both U-87MG and T98G cells, but active caspase-1 fragment was not formed, probably due to nonspecific proteolysis. Immunoreactive 32-kDa procaspase-3 was degraded into active 12-kDa caspase-3 fragment as early as 8 h in U-87MG cells and 4 h in T98G cells after treatment with calphostin C, persisting for at least 12 h in both U-87MG and T98G cells (Fig.4). The generation of a COOH-terminal 85-kDa PARP apoptotic fragment (34Tewari M. Quan L.T. O'Rourke K. Desnoyers S. Zeng Z. Beidler D.R. Poirier G.G. Salvesen G.S. Dixit V.M.

These data are consistent with activation of caspase-3 in calphostin C-treated gliomas.

The induction of oligonucleosomal DNA laddering by calphostin C could be completely blocked by treatment with 100 μm Ac-DEVD.cho in both U-87MG and T98G cells but not by treatment with 100 μm Ac-YVAD.cho (Fig. 2), confirming the activation of caspase-3 but not caspase-1. These findings again suggest that calphostin C-induced apoptosis proceeds independently of caspase-1 and may depend on caspase-3 or similar proteases. The measurements of activities of caspase-1 and -3 using fluorescent substrates also indicate similar results. 2I. Ozaki, E. Tani, H. Ikemoto, H. Kitagawa, and H. Fujikawa, unpublished data. The anti-human Shc antibody specifically recognized 46-, 52-, and 66-kDa isoforms of Shc as shown in Fig.5. When the Shc immunoprecipitates were immunoblotted with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody, 46-, 52-, and 66-kDa Shc isoforms were shown to be tyrosine-phosphorylated, and the 52-kDa isoform was the major phosphorylated species (Fig. 5). The phosphorylation levels of Shc were increased as early as 2 h after treatment with 100 nm calphostin C and persisting for at least 6 h in both U-87MG and T98G cells, whereas the levels of immunoreactive Shc were not changed during the increase in the Shc phosphorylation, suggesting Shc activation. The activation of Raf1 was determined by the presence of Raf1 with reduced gel electrophoretic mobility due to phosphorylation (27Kinoshita T. Yokota T. Arai K. Miyajima A.

As shown in Fig.6, immunoreactive Raf1 doublet in control cells became a singlet 2 to 8 h after treatment with 100 nm calphostin C in both U-87MG and T98G cells, suggesting a marked decrease in phosphorylation of Raf1. Phosphorylation of ERK was estimated by an in gel MBP kinase assay. Two isoforms of ERK1 and ERK2 were shown to be phosphorylated to a similar degree prior to treatment with calphostin C, and the phosphorylation of ERK1 and ERK2 begins to rapidly diminish as early as 2 h after treatment with calphostin C in both U-87MG and T98G cells and thereafter continuously decreased, as shown representatively in Fig. 7. On the contrary, the levels of immunoreactive ERK1 and ERK2 were not changed during treatment with calphostin C for 8 h and were slightly decreased by treatment for 12 h in both U-87 MG and T98G cells as shown in Fig. 7.Figure 6Analysis of Raf1 activation shows that immunoreactive Raf1 with reduced mobility (upper arrow) is barely detectable as early as 2 h after treatment with 100 nm calphostin C and persisting during the treatment for at least 8 h in both U-87MG and T98G cells, suggesting the decrease in phosphorylation of Raf1 by calphostin C.

SAPK/JNK was shown as a doublet, and p38 kinase was shown as a singlet. Phospho-SAPK/JNK1 and -SAPK/JNK2 (Thr183/Tyr185) as well as phospho-p38 kinase (Tyr182) were increased gradually as early as 2 h after treatment with calphostin C in both U-87MG and T98G cells. The phosphorylation of SAPK/JNK1 and SAPK/JNK2 as well as p38 kinase reached a peak at 8 or 12 h in U-87MG cells and at 6 or 8 h in T98G cells (Figs. 8 and9). SAPK/JNK2 was sometimes slightly more phosphorylated than SAPK/JNK1. On the other hand, the levels of immunoreactive SAPK/JNK1 and SAPK/JNK2 as well as p38 kinase were not changed during the increase in phosphorylation of SAPK/JNK and p38 kinase in both U-87MG and T98G cells.

As a first step toward characterization of PP4 holoenzymes and identification of putative PP4 regulatory subunits, PP4 was purified from bovine testis soluble extracts. PP4 existed in two complexes of approximately 270–300 and 400–450 kDa as determined by gel filtration chromatography. The smaller PP4 complex was purified by sequential phenyl-Sepharose, Source 15Q, DEAE2, and Superdex 200 gel filtration chromatographies. The final product contained two major proteins: the PP4 catalytic subunit plus a protein that migrated as a doublet of 120–125 kDa on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The associated protein, termed PP4R1, and PP4C also bound to microcystin-Sepharose. Mass spectrometry analysis of the purified complex revealed two major peaks, at 35 (PP4C) and 105 kDa (PP4R1).

Cell. 1995; 80: 225-236Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2568) Google Scholar). The dephosphorylation of proteins by serine/threonine phosphatases is equally important for the occurrence of this signaling phenomenon. Four major cellular protein serine/threonine phosphatase activities (PP1, PP2A, PP2B, and PP2C)1 have been reported and classified according to substrate selectivity, inhibitor sensitivity, and requirement for divalent cations (2Brautigan D.L.

Various molecular biology techniques have led to the identification of several additional phosphatases including protein phosphatase 4, formerly known as protein phosphatase X (7Cohen P.T.W. Brewis N.D. Hughes V. Mann D.J. FEBS Lett. 1990; 268: 355-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 8Chen M.X. Chen Y.H. Cohen P.T.W. FEBS Lett. 1992; 306: 54-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). PP2A is one of the best studied protein serine/threonine phosphatases. Several reports have demonstrated an important regulatory role for PP2A in a variety of cellular processes. Because PP2A is involved in many cellular events, its activity must be tightly controlled in vivo. Two major mechanisms of regulation of PP2A have been described in the literature. The first involves post-translational modifications of the catalytic subunit of PP2A (PP2AC). Phosphorylation of a tyrosine residue near the C terminus (9Chen J. Parsons S. Brautigan D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7957-7962Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or phosphorylation of an unidentified threonine residue (10Guo H. Damuni Z. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2500-2504Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) decreases catalytic activity in vitro. Conversely, carboxymethylation of the C-terminal leucine causes an increase in phosphatase activity (11Favre B. Zolnierowicz S. Turowski P. Hemmings B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16311-16317Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The second major mechanism of regulation of PP2AC is through its association with other proteins. PP2A exists as a heterotrimeric complex consisting of a catalytic subunit (C) associated with a structural subunit (A) and a variable subunit (B). The A subunit is thought to act as a scaffold for the B and C subunits (5Mumby M.C. Walter G. Physiol. Rev. 1993; 73: 673-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (623) Google Scholar, 12Mayer-Jaekel R.E.

In addition to the regulation of PP2AC by associated subunits and post-translational modification, the PP2A holoenzyme forms complexes with other cellular proteins, such as Tau (16Sontag E. Nunbhakdi-Craig V. Lee G. Bloom G.S. Mumby M.C. Neuron. 1996; 17: 1201-1207Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar) and Ca+2/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase IV (17Westphal R.S. Anderson K.A. Means A.R. Wadzinski B.E. Science. 1998; 280: 1258-1261Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). The catalytic subunit of protein phosphatase 4 (PP4C) is 65% identical to PP2AC at the amino acid level (18Brewis N.D. Street A.J. Prescott A.R. Cohen P.T.W. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 987-996Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar) and has been placed in the type 2A family of phosphatases. PP4Chas been highly conserved between species sharing 91% amino acid identity between human and Drosophila (19Brewis N.D. Cohen P.T.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1171: 231-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). PP4Cis predominantly localized in the nucleus in rat brain and liver but is most highly expressed in testis (20Kloeker S. Bryant J.C. Strack S. Colbran R.J. Wadzinski B.E. Biochem. J. 1997; 327: 481-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Additionally, PP4Cwas demonstrated to be an essential enzyme in the development ofDrosophila embryos (21Helps N.R. Brewis N.D. Lineruth K. Davis T. Kaiser K. Cohen P.T.W. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 1331-1340Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The expression of PP4Cwas reduced to 25% of the normal protein level in a mutant strain ofDrosophila termed centrosomes minus microtubules (cmm) (21Helps N.R. Brewis N.D. Lineruth K. Davis T. Kaiser K. Cohen P.T.W. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 1331-1340Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). An interesting characteristic of thecmm phenotype is the presence of regions of cells that are unable to complete mitosis because no microtubules exist to connect chromatin and centrosomes. This phenotype implicates PP4Cin the regulation of the nucleation and/or stabilization of microtubules. These data taken together indicate that PP4 has a crucial cellular function, although a physiological substrate for PP4 has not yet been identified. Appropriate regulation of PP4 is likely critical to its normal physiological function. The close homology of PP2AC and PP4C sequence suggests that they may share certain regulatory properties. Indeed, it was recently shown that PP4C, like PP2AC, is carboxymethylated (20Kloeker S. Bryant J.C. Strack S. Colbran R.J. Wadzinski B.E. Biochem. J. 1997; 327: 481-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Furthermore, by analogy with both PP1 and PP2A, it is unlikely that PP4 exists as free catalytic subunits in the cell (5Mumby M.C. Walter G. Physiol. Rev. 1993; 73: 673-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (623) Google Scholar). However, PP4C does not associate with the A subunit of PP2A in vitro (18Brewis N.D. Street A.J. Prescott A.R. Cohen P.T.W. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 987-996Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). 2S. Kloeker and B. Wadzinski, unpublished observations. 2S. Kloeker and B. Wadzinski, unpublished observations. In order to better understand and characterize the physiologically relevant forms of PP4, we now report the purification of a heterodimeric form of PP4 and identification of the first PP4C-associated protein, termed PP4R1.

Microcystin-Sepharose and microcystin were obtained from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY) and Alexis Corp. (San Diego, CA), respectively. Bovine testes were purchased from Pel-Freeze (Rogers, AR) and stored at −80 °C. Centricon-30 concentrators were from Amicon (Beverly, MA). Aprotinin, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, pepstatin A, leupeptin, and SDS-PAGE molecular mass standards were from Sigma. Nylon-reinforced nitrocellulose membrane and Centrex UF-0.5 concentrators were manufactured by Schleicher & Schuell. Polyvinylidene fluoride membrane was obtained from Millipore Corp. (Bedford, MA). The sequencing reagents BigDye and Half-TERM were purchased from Perkin-Elmer and GenPak (Stony Brook, NY), respectively. NdeI was from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA); EcoRI and XhoI were from Promega (Madison, WI). Plasmid purification kits and pcDNA3.1 were obtained from Qiagen (Valencia, CA) and Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA), respectively. SulfoLink Gel was purchased from Pierce. The monoclonal anti-Myc antibody was a generous gift from Dr. Lee Limbird (Vanderbilt University). Bovine testes (200 g) were homogenized (five 5-s bursts, followed by three 10-s bursts) using a Waring blender in 600 ml of homogenization buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm EGTA, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 6.3 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 mm benzamidine, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 2 μg/ml pepstatin A) and filtered through four layers of cheesecloth. All purification steps were performed at 4 °C unless otherwise indicated. The homogenate was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min, and the resulting supernatant was subsequently centrifuged at 100,000 ×g for 1 h. This supernatant was carefully removed and immediately brought to 25% ammonium sulfate saturation. Proteins precipitating between 25 and 50% saturation were either stored at −20 °C or immediately resuspended in 80 ml of buffer X (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1 mm EGTA, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, 6.3 μg/ml aprotinin, 4 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 mmbenzamidine, 4 μg/ml pepstatin A, and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and utilized for chromatographic analyses and PP4 purification. All protein chromatographic steps were performed on the FPLC System (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The resuspended 50% ammonium sulfate pellets (above) were brought to at least 0.3 m ammonium sulfate by adding the appropriate volume of 4 m ammonium sulfate. The mixture was incubated on ice for 30 min and subsequently centrifuged at 13,000 rpm (Sorvall SS34) for 30 min. One-half of the supernatant was applied to a phenyl-Sepharose column (34 ml) equilibrated in 300 mm ammonium sulfate buffer X, and the column was developed with a linear gradient (184 ml) of 300–0 mm ammonium sulfate (buffer X without phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) at 4 ml/min collecting 8-ml fractions. PP4-containing fractions from two successive phenyl-Sepharose columns were identified by immunoblot analysis, pooled, and diluted 2-fold with buffer X. The sample was loaded at 2 ml/min onto a Source 15Q column (8 ml) equilibrated in buffer X containing 100 mm NaCl; proteins were eluted with a linear gradient of 100–450 mm NaCl (320 ml) at 4 ml/min collecting 8-ml fractions. Two peaks of PP4 eluted from Source 15Q at 250 and 300 mm NaCl (Fig. 1 A). Fractions 19–21 (250–300 mm NaCl) containing PP4 pool 1 (see “Results”) were combined and further purified over a Bio-Scale DEAE2 column (2 ml, equilibrated in 350 mm NaCl buffer X) using a linear gradient of 350–1000 mm NaCl (50 ml), collecting 1-ml fractions at 1 ml/min. Finally, the PP4 fractions obtained from DEAE chromatography (600–700 mm NaCl) were concentrated to 2 ml with a Centricon-30 concentrator and purified to near homogeneity by Superdex 200 gel filtration chromatography. The gel filtration column (120 ml) was equilibrated in buffer X containing 150 mm NaCl and developed at 1 ml/min collecting 2-ml fractions. Protein standards utilized for calibration of the gel filtration column included thyroglobulin (669 kDa), ferritin (440 kDa), catalase (232 kDa), aldolase (158 kDa), bovine serum albumin (67 kDa), ovalbumin (43 kDa), chymotrypsinogen (25 kDa), and ribonuclease A (13.7 kDa). Molecular weights of PP4 complexes were estimated from a graph of the logarithm of molecular weight as a function of elution volume of the standards. Samples were boiled for 10 min in Laemmli sample buffer (22Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar) and then subjected to SDS-PAGE (10% gel, 0.75 mm, unless otherwise indicated). After electrophoresis, proteins were either visualized by silver stain (23Morrissey J.H. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 117: 307-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (2924) Google Scholar) or transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane in 10 mm CAPS buffer, pH 11.0, containing 10% methanol. The blots were incubated with the appropriate affinity-purified anti-peptide antibodies (20Kloeker S. Bryant J.C. Strack S. Colbran R.J. Wadzinski B.E. Biochem. J. 1997; 327: 481-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 24Strack S. Westphal R.S. Colbran R.J. Ebner F.F. Wadzinski B.E. Mol. Brain Res. 1997; 49: 15-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), followed by incubation with goat anti-rabbit IgG-alkaline phosphatase conjugate. Immunocomplexes were visualized with 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate and nitro blue tetrazolium as substrates for alkaline phosphatase. The amount of PP4C in bovine testis extracts was estimated by preparing a standard curve of purified PP4C (protocol to be published elsewhere) and comparing the immunoblot intensities with samples from bovine testis soluble extracts. To visualize and quantitate PP4C immunoreactivity, an 125I-labeled donkey anti-rabbit IgG (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was utilized as the secondary antibody. The proteins corresponding to PP4C were excised and counted using a γ-counter. The amount of PP4Cin the purified PP4 holoenzyme was measured by quantifying the intensity of silver-stained proteins using NIH Image. Purified PP2AC was used as the standard, and its concentration was determined by the Bio-Rad protein assay. The purified PP4 holoenzyme was concentrated to approximately 1 pmol/μl using a Centrex UF-0.5 concentrator. Glutaraldehyde was added to the sample to achieve a 0.5% (v/v) concentration, and aliquots were removed and analyzed over a time period of 240 min. The reaction was quenched by the addition of the matrix, as described below. The sample was mass-analyzed with a PerSeptive Voyager Elite matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometer. A nitrogen laser (337 nm) was used to irradiate the sample with sinapinic acid as the matrix. Approximately 0.5 μl of sample was mixed with 0.5 μl of a saturated solution of sinapinic acid in a 1:1 acetonitrile/water solvent containing 0.5% trifluoracetic acid on a target sample plate. After drying in air for several minutes, the target plate was placed in the mass spectrometer and then analyzed. An accelerating voltage of 25 kV was used to accelerate the ions in the time-of-flight analysis. Phosphorylated substrates were prepared as described previously for casein (25Strack S. Barban M.A. Wadzinski B.E. Colbran R.J. J. Neurochem. 1997; 68: 2119-2128Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar) and phosphorylase a and histone H1 (26Wadzinski B.E. Wheat W.H. Jaspers S. Peruski Jr., L.F. Lickteig R.L. Johnson G.L. Klemn D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2822-2834Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Purified proteins (approximately 0.14 ng of PP2ACand approximately 11.3 ng of PP4C contained in PP4) were assayed for phosphatase activity in a 100-μl reaction volume containing 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 32P-labeled substrate. Following a 10-min incubation at 37 °C, the reaction was terminated by the addition of trichloroacetic acid (20% final concentration), and proteins were pelleted by centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 10 min. Supernatants were collected and quantitated for [32P]i, released by scintillation counting. Less than 20% of the total phosphorylated substrate was dephosphorylated during the assays, thus assuring that substrate was not limiting. PP4 obtained from the final gel filtration column was concentrated using a Centricon-30 concentrator, separated on a 6% (for analysis of 120–125-kDa doublet) or 10% (analysis of 29-kDa protein) polyacrylamide gel and transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride membrane. The membrane was briefly stained with Coomassie R-250. Individual proteins were excised and digested in situ with lysyl endopeptidase alone or with lysyl endopeptidase followed by endoproteinase Asp-N. The resulting peptides were separated by high performance liquid chromatography and subjected to automated Edman degradation on a Perkin Elmer/Applied Biosystems Procise 492 protein sequencer. Sequencing was performed by Vanderbilt University Peptide Sequencing and Amino Acid Analysis Shared Resource. The cDNA for PP4R1 was identified by using the peptide sequences (derived from the purified proteins) to search the expressed sequence tag data base with the BLAST protocol. 3This protocol can be found on the World Wide Web at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST/. The cDNA clones were obtained from The Institute for Genomic Research/American Type Culture Collection Human cDNA Special Collection (Rockville, MD) and sequenced in their entirety by fluorescent dideoxy terminator-based DNA sequencing (performed on an ABI310 sequencer in the Center for Molecular Neuroscience DNA Sequencing Facility, Vanderbilt University). A peptide (CASTHPASTRISED) identical to an amino acid sequence found in one of the bovine PP4R1 peptides was synthesized with an amino-terminal cysteine residue. The peptide was coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin usingm-maleimidobenzoyl-N-hydroxysuccinimide ester as described previously (27Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar). The peptide-keyhole limpet hemocyanin (250 μg) conjugates were injected subcutaneously into rabbits, first in complete Freund's adjuvant followed by several boosts in incomplete adjuvant. The antiserum was characterized by immunoblotting bovine testes soluble extracts in the absence and presence of the peptide. PP4R1 anti-peptide antibodies (designated αPP4R1-1) were purified from rabbit antiserum by affinity chromatography (27Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar). Briefly, the synthetic peptide was attached covalently to SulfoLink Gel, and the slurry was transferred to a column. Rabbit antiserum diluted 1:2 with Tris buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5) was passed over the peptide-Sepharose conjugate three times. The resin was washed with Tris buffer and then with Tris buffer containing 500 mm NaCl. Bound antibodies were eluted by sequential addition of 100 mm glycine, pH 2.5, followed by 100 mm triethylamine, pH 11.5. The eluates were pooled, and the antibodies were concentrated and dialyzed against Tris-buffered saline containing 0.02% NaN3 using Centriprep-30 concentrators. A second peptide (CASENIFNRQMVARS) corresponding to amino acid residues 39–52 in the predicted human sequence was synthesized with an amino-terminal cysteine residue. This peptide was utilized to generate a second rabbit polyclonal antiserum (designated αPP4R1-2) using similar methodology as described above. Bovine testis soluble extracts (5 mg) were incubated with 30 μl of microcystin-Sepharose (50% slurry) while rotating overnight at 4 °C. The beads were pelleted and washed six times with 1 ml of buffer X containing 150 mm NaCl, and bound proteins were eluted with Laemmli sample buffer. Applied, unbound, and bound samples were analyzed by immunoblot. A cDNA fragment encoding the NH2-terminal Myc-tagged (MEQKLISEEDL) PP4R1 was produced by successive polymerase chain reactions (PCRs) and restriction enzyme digestion. The first PCR product was made using sense oligonucleotide 1 (5′-CTC ATC TCA GAA GAG GAT CTG GCG GAC CTC TCG CTG CT-3′), antisense oligonucleotide 2 (5′-AAA AAG CAT ATG GTA TTG-3′), and human PP4R1 cDNA as template. Successive PCR using sense oligonucleotide 3 (5′-GGC CGA ATT CAG GAT GGA ACA AAA ACT CAT CTC AGA AGA GGA TCT GGC-3′), antisense oligonucleotide 2, and the first PCR product as template generated a PCR product that was digested with the restriction enzymesEcoRI and NdeI. The resulting cDNA fragment and the cDNA fragment of PP4R1 from the NdeI site to the XhoI site (3′-end of PP4R1) were ligated into the EcoRI/XhoI cloning site of the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3.1 to produce the NH2-terminal epitope-tagged PP4R1 cDNA under the control of the cytomegalovirus promoter. The construct was verified by restriction enzyme analysis and DNA sequencing. COS M6 cells maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum were transiently transfected (10-cm tissue culture dishes) using the DEAE-dextran procedure as described previously (28Selden R.F. Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. 1995; 1 (New York): 9.2.1-9.2.6Google Scholar, 29Wadzinski B.E. Eisfelder B.J. Peruski Jr., L.F. Mumby M.C. Johnson G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16883-16888Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Transfected COS cells (one 10-cm dish) were dislodged by scraping in 1 ml of lysis buffer containing 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5% Triton X-100, 6.3 μg/ml aprotinin, 4 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 mm benzamidine, 4 μg/ml pepstatin A, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Cells were sonicated with two 10-s bursts followed by centrifugation for 15 min. The protein concentration of clarified supernatants was estimated by the BioRad protein assay using bovine serum albumin as the standard. Approximately 1 mg of protein from cell lysates (in 1 ml of lysis buffer) was incubated with 40 μl of anti-Myc ascites for 6 h while rotating at 4 °C. Immune complexes were isolated by adding 40 μl of a 50% slurry of GammaBind Plus Sepharose. After washing the beads six times with lysis buffer, bound proteins were eluted with 20 μl of Laemmli sample buffer. The proteins were analyzed by immunoblot analysis with affinity-purified antibodies directed against the C terminus of PP4C. During the initial stages of purification of PP4 holoenzymes from various tissues, a broad elution profile of PP4 immunoreactivity was observed on several chromatography columns including anion exchange and gel filtration (data not shown). One possible explanation of this behavior is that PP4, like PP2A, exists in multiple oligomeric complexes. To address this possibility, the elution of distinct partially purified PP4 species from gel filtration chromatography were compared. Because PP4C protein is expressed in greatest quantity in the testis (20Kloeker S. Bryant J.C. Strack S. Colbran R.J. Wadzinski B.E. Biochem. J. 1997; 327: 481-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), this tissue was utilized for subsequent biochemical manipulations and holoenzyme purification. Bovine testis soluble proteins recovered from 25–50% ammonium sulfate precipitation were separated by sequential hydrophobic interaction and anion exchange chromatography. Fractions containing PP4 were identified by immunoblot analysis using a PP4Cantibody previously described (20Kloeker S. Bryant J.C. Strack S. Colbran R.J. Wadzinski B.E. Biochem. J. 1997; 327: 481-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). PP4 eluted over several fractions with two noticeable peaks from Source 15Q (fractions 20 and 25; Fig.1 A). Pools of each PP4 peak were individually applied to a gel filtration column (Fig.1 B). Immunoblot analysis of select gel filtration fractions indicated that PP4 in pool 1 exhibited an apparent molecular mass of approximately 270–300 kDa (fractions 31–34), whereas PP4 in pool 2 was slightly larger, approximately 400–450 kDa (fractions 29–32). These data suggest that PP4C exists in at least two distinct complexes in bovine testis. Immunoblot analysis of the gel filtration fractions using affinity-purified antibodies to the A and Bα subunits of PP2A revealed that the PP2A subunits did not co-fractionate with PP4C (data not shown). As a first step toward identifying PP4-associated subunits, the purification of a PP4 holoenzyme from bovine testis was undertaken. PP4 (270–300 kDa) was purified by sequential chromatography on hydrophobic, strong anion exchange, weak anion exchange, and gel filtration columns. Fig.2 shows fractions from the gel filtration column as analyzed by immunoblot and silver stain. Silver stain analysis revealed a protein doublet (120–125 kDa) co-fractionating with the catalytic subunit of PP4. The molecular mass of the co-purifying protein doublet was carefully determined by comparing its migration with the migration of SDS-PAGE standards (data not shown). Taking into account the differences in molecular masses of these two proteins (see mass spectrometry analysis below), one might predict a 3:1 protein staining ratio if the complex existed in a 1:1 molar stoichiometry. The protein silver staining ratio of the 120–125-kDa co-purifying proteins to PP4C ranged f"

When cellular sterol levels are low, the sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBPs) are released from the endoplasmic reticulum membrane, allowing them to translocate to the nucleus and activate SREBP target genes. However, in all SREBP-regulated promoters studied to date, additional co-regulatory transcription factors are required for sterol-regulated activation of transcription. We have previously shown that, in addition to SREBPs, NF-Y/CBF is required for sterol-regulated transcription of HMG-CoA synthase. This heterotrimeric transcription factor has recently been shown to function as a co-regulator in several other SREBP-regulated promoters, as well. In addition to cis-acting sites for both SREBP and NF-Y/CBF, the sterol regulatory region of the synthase promoter also contains a consensus cAMP response element (CRE), an element that binds members of the CREB/ATF family of transcription factors. Here, we show that this consensus CRE is essential for sterol-regulated transcription of the synthase promoter. Using in vitro binding assays, we also demonstrate that CREB binds to this CRE, and mutations within the CRE that result in a loss of CREB binding also result in a loss of sterol-regulated transcription. We further show that efficient activation of the synthase promoter in Drosophila SL2 cells requires the simultaneous expression of all three factors: SREBPs, NF-Y/CBF, and CREB. To date this is the first promoter shown to require CREB for efficient sterol-regulated transcription, and to require two different co-regulatory factors in addition to SREBPs for maximal activation. 3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) synthase, a key regulatory enzyme in the pathway for endogenous cholesterol synthesis, is a target for negative feedback regulation by cholesterol.

In order to achieve cellular cholesterol homeostasis, this and other genes of cholesterol metabolism are regulated by classical feedback repression: they are up-regulated when sterol levels fall and down-regulated when sterol levels rise (1Gil G.

Chem. 1987; 262: 10773-10779Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This control is exerted primarily at the transcriptional level through the action of the sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBPs), a unique subfamily of basic helix-loop-helix zipper (bHLHZip) proteins. SREBPs are expressed as 125-kDa precursor proteins that are anchored to the endoplasmic reticulum and nuclear membranes. When cellular sterol levels fall, the precursor is released from the membrane by a two-step proteolytic mechanism, allowing the mature, transcriptionally active SREBPs to translocate to the nucleus (6Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1997; 89: 331-340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2959) Google Scholar). Once inside the nucleus, SREBPs activate cholesterogenic target genes through binding to sterol regulatory elements (SREs) present in their promoters. SREBPs also activate key genes of fatty acid metabolism (7Bennett M.K. Lopez J.M. Sanchez H.B. Osborne T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25578-25583Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar, 8Lopez J.M. Bennett M.K. Sanchez H.B. Rosenfeld J.M. Osborne T.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 1997; 272: 7298-7305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar) thus, they are central transcription factors of mammalian lipid metabolism. SREBPs alone, however, are inefficient transcriptional activators, and in all SREBP-regulated promoters studied to date, additional transcription factors are necessary for maximal activation in response to sterol deprivation. Interestingly, the required co-regulator is not the same for all SREBP-regulated promoters. For example, in the case of the farnesyl diphosphate synthase promoter, the required co-regulator is NF-Y/CBF (10Jackson S.M. Ericsson J. Osborne T.F. Edwards P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21445-21448Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), whereas in the LDL receptor promoter, it is Sp1 (11Sanchez H.B. Yieh L. Osborne T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1161-1169Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). The region of the HMG-CoA synthase promoter that is necessary for sterol-regulated transcription is contained within an approximate 100-base pair region, which includes two consensus SREs, a CCAAT box, and a consensus cAMP response element (CRE) (12Dooley K.A. Millinder S. Osborne T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1349-1356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar) (see Fig. 1). Previous studies have demonstrated that both SREs, termed SRE I 5′ and SRE I 3′, as well as the inverted CCAAT box, are essential for sterol-regulated transcription. These elements recruit SREBP and NF-Y/CBF, respectively, to the promoter under conditions of sterol deprivation (10Jackson S.M. Ericsson J. Osborne T.F. Edwards P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21445-21448Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 12Dooley K.A. Millinder S. Osborne T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1349-1356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). However, the potential involvement of the CRE has not previously been evaluated. CREs were originally identified as cis-acting elements that confer transcriptional activation in response to elevated cAMP levels (13Montminy M.R. Sevarino K.A. Wagner J.A. Mandel G. Goodman R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 6682-6686Crossref PubMed Scopus (1055) Google Scholar, 14Short J.M. Wynshaw-Boris A. Short H.P. Hanson R.W. J. Biol.

Nature. 1986; 323: 353-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar). Using the somatostatin promoter, it was shown that this responsiveness was mediated through activation and recruitment of the basic leucine zipper containing transcription factor termed cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) (16Montminy M. Bilezikjian L.M. Nature. 1987; 328: 175-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (960) Google Scholar). CREB is phosphorylated in response to elevated cAMP, and this allows it to interact efficiently with the transcriptional co-activator protein called CREB-binding protein to stimulate transcription of cAMP target genes (17Yamamoto K.K. Gonzalez G.A. Biggs III, W.H. Montminy M.R. Nature. 1988; 334: 494-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (968) Google Scholar, 18Gonzalez G.A. Montminy M.R. Cell. 1989; 59: 675-680Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2044) Google Scholar). Subsequently, numerous related CRE-binding proteins have been identified and cloned (19Hai T. Liu F. Coukos W. Green M. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 2083-2090Crossref PubMed Scopus (754) Google Scholar) and together they comprise the CREB/ATF family of transcription factors. Individual members of this family bind to CREs present in numerous eukaryotic promoters, and activate transcription in response to various cellular signals (20Habener J.F. Mol. Endocrinol. 1990; 4: 1087-1094Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar, 21Brindle P.K. Montminy M.R. Curr. Opin. Gen. Dev. 1992; : 199-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar, 22Lee K.A.W. Masson N. Biochem. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1174: 221-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). In the current studies, we investigated the role of the putative CRE in sterol-regulated transcription of the HMG-CoA synthase gene. In a thorough mutational analysis of the promoter regulatory region, we noted that single point mutations that alter the consensus CRE resulted in a complete loss of sterol-regulated transcription. Using in vitro binding assays, we show that CREB binds to the wild type consensus CRE of the synthase promoter, and mutations within the CRE that abolish sterol-regulated transcription completely disrupt CREB binding to this element. Furthermore, using a Drosophilatissue culture cell line that does not express several mammalian transcription factors, we show that maximal activation of the synthase promoter requires the simultaneous expression of SREBP, NF-Y/CBF, and CREB. To date, this is the first case in which SREBP has been shown to require two different co-regulatory DNA-binding proteins to activate a promoter in response to sterol deprivation. Additionally, this is the first report demonstrating that a member of the CREB/ATF family can function together with the SREBPs to mediate sterol-regulated transcription. All of the cell culture lines used here have been described before (11Sanchez H.B. Yieh L. Osborne T.F. J. Biol.

Cholesterol and 25-OH cholesterol were obtained from Steraloids Inc., and stock solutions were dissolved in absolute ethanol. pGL2 basic was purchased from Promega Inc. and was used as the source of the luciferase reporter gene in all constructs.

The resulting fragments were inserted into the pPac vector after excision of the Sp1 coding sequence. CV-1 cells were cultured at 37 °C and 7% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum (normal) and were plated at 125,000 cells/60-mm dish on day 0. On day 1, cells were refed normal media and transfected by the calcium phosphate co-precipitation method as described (11Sanchez H.B. Yieh L. Osborne T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1161-1169Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Precipitates contained 20 μg each of the luciferase reporter test plasmid and the non-sterol regulated pCMV2 β-Gal plasmid. Salmon sperm DNA was added to bring the total DNA to 60 μg/2 ml. An equal volume (0.5 ml) was added to each of four dishes, for a total of 15 μg of DNA/60-mm dish. Twelve to 16 h later, the cells were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), refed either induced (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium + 10% lipoprotein-depleted serum) or suppressed media (same as induced media but also containing 10 μg/ml cholesterol and 1 μg/ml 25-OH cholesterol), and returned to the incubator. On day 3, cells were harvested by scraping in phosphate-buffered saline and duplicate dishes were pooled prior to preparation of soluble protein extracts by 3 freeze-thaw cycles. Drosophila SL2 cells were cultured at 25 °C in Shields and Sang Drosophila media (Sigma) containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum. On day 0, cells were seeded at 1 × 106 cells/60-mm dish. On day 1, the cells were transfected by a standard calcium phosphate co-precipitation method (25Courey A.J. Tjian R. Cell. 1988; 55: 887-898Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1075) Google Scholar). On day 3, cells were harvested, extracts were prepared by the freeze-thaw method, and assays were performed as described below. The luciferase activities were measured in an Analytical Luminescence monolight model 2010 luminometer with a luciferin reagent from Promega Inc. β-Galactosidase assays were performed by a standard colorimetric procedure with 2-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactopyranoside as substrate (24Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The normalized luciferase activity was obtained by dividing the luciferase activity in relative light units by the β-galactosidase activity (OD 420/h). A 30-base pair double-stranded oligonucleotide probe corresponding to bases −284 to −259 of the wild type HMG-CoA synthase promoter was end labeled with [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). The mutant probes (CRE Mutant A, CRE mutant B, SRE mutant) are exactly the same except for the mutation −265G→T, −264T→G, or −272A→C, respectively. The labeled probes were used in an electrophoretic mobility shift assay as described previously (11Sanchez H.B. Yieh L. Osborne T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1161-1169Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar) with proteins prepared as described below. The expression and purification of amino acids 1–490 of SREBP1a has been described previously (11Sanchez H.B. Yieh L. Osborne T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1161-1169Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). The glutathione S-transferase (GST)-CREB expression construct was made by excising the CREB coding sequence from the plasmid pPacCREB using HindIII andBamHI. The resulting fragment was then inserted in-frame with the GST coding region in the pGex2T plasmid. GST-CREB was expressed in E. coli strain DH5αF′. After harvesting the 200-ml cultures, pellets were resuspended in 4 ml of ice-cold sucrose solution (10 mm Tris, pH 8, 20% sucrose, 1 mmdithiothreitol), incubated on ice for 15 min in the presence of lysozyme (50 mg/ml stock), then incubated on ice for 10 min in the presence of EDTA (final concentration of 1 mm). Sarkosyl (10% stock solution) was added to a final concentration of 0.05% and the samples were sonicated 3 times for 10 s each. Cell debris was pelleted by centrifugation. The supernatant was then incubated with 1:1 slurry of glutathione-agarose (Sigma) on a rotating wheel at 4 °C for 3 h, followed by extensive washing with Wash Buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 200 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin/pepstatin, 10% glycerol). Bound proteins were eluted with 5 mmglutathione. The fusion proteins were expressed in E. coli strain DH5αF′. Cultures (100 ml) were grown to OD600 of 0.6 to 0.8, induced by adding isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to final concentration of 1 mm, and grown for an additional 3 h at 37 °C. Cells were then harvested by centrifugation. The cell pellets were resuspended in NETN (100 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris, pH 8, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40), lysed by sonication, and the cell debris was removed by ultracentrifugation. Glycerol was added to the supernatant to a final concentration of 10%, and extracts were stored in aliquots at −70 °C. The expression of the fusion protein was verified by SDS-PAGE analysis followed by staining with Coomassie Blue, as well as by an immunoblotting protocol with an anti-GST antibody and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (Sigma). To 10 μl of glutathione-agarose beads, 100 μl of the indicated crude GST fusion protein extract, and 300 μl of buffer (Z′0.1, 50 mm Hepes pH 7.5, 2 mm MgCl2, 100 mm KCl, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 0.1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40) + 0.5% non-fat dry milk + 5 mm dithiothreitol) were added followed by an incubation on a rotating wheel at 4 °C for 2 h. The bound GST fusion protein was pelleted in a microcentrifuge and nonspecifically bound proteins were removed by washing the pellets 3 times with 1 ml of buffer. Then, 5 μl of purified SREBP-1a was added to the bound proteins, along with 300 μl of buffer, and incubated on a rotating wheel for an additional 2 h at 4 °C. The reactions were again washed 3 times with 1 ml of buffer, and specifically bound proteins were pelleted, resuspended in sample buffer, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by Western blot analysis using the ECL kit (Pierce) and an anti-SREBP-1 primary antibody (IGG2A4). Previous studies have demonstrated that a 100-base pair region of the HMG-CoA synthase promoter is necessary and sufficient for efficient sterol-regulated transcription. Within this region, two binding sites for SREBP and one binding site for NF-Y/CBF were shown to be critical (12Dooley K.A. Millinder S. Osborne T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1349-1356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). To determine if there are other critical elements within this 100-bp interval, we introduced a series of single point mutations into the region and fused the resulting mutant promoters to a luciferase reporter gene. Each construct was then transiently transfected into CV-1 cells and assayed for sterol-regulated transcription by culturing the transfected cells either under induced (−sterols) or suppressed (+sterols) conditions. The results for constructs containing mutations within the region −277 to −260, relative to the transcription start site, are shown (Fig.2 A), and the ratio of reporter gene activity under induced to suppressed conditions is reported as fold regulation (Fig.2 B). SynSRE is the wild type promoter-reporter construct, and SynTLuc is a control promoter-reporter construct containing only the HMG-CoA synthase minimal TATA box. Mutations in the 5′-half of the SRE-I 5′ resulted in a decrease in sterol-regulated transcription due to a loss in promoter activity under induced conditions, as expected. However, mutations in the 3′-half of the SRE-I 5′did not result in a dramatic decrease in sterol regulation. In the case of −268T→G, this was due to an increase in activity under both induced and suppressed conditions. The reason for this is not clear. In the promoter constructs containing mutations corresponding to −268T→A, −267A→C, and −266C→A, an increase in sterol regulation was observed due to a decrease in the level of promoter activity under both induced and suppressed conditions. This effect may be due to disruption of binding of a CREB/ATF protein at the overlapping CRE, which normally contributes to both the induced and the suppressed activity (in this case equivalent to the basal activity) of the promoter. This possibility is further supported by the dramatic loss in sterol regulation for the mutants −264T→G and −265G→T, both of which mutate critical bases within the consensus CRE, while leaving the consensus SRE intact. Taken as a whole, these results indicate that a CREB/ATF family member is involved in sterol-regulated transcription of the HMG-CoA synthase promoter. The mutations at −264 and −265 discussed above are adjacent to the consensus SRE element but are contained within the putative CRE. To determine if these mutations were defective for sterol regulation due to a loss in binding of either CREB or SREBP-1a, recombinant versions of each protein were used in an electrophoretic mobility shift assay with either the wild type or selective mutant HMG-CoA synthase probes (Fig. 3). Using the wild type synthase probe, a shifted complex was observed in the presence of either SREBP-1a or CREB (Fig. 3, A andB, lanes 2 and 3). However, using probes corresponding to the single mutations in the consensus CRE at bases −264 or −265 (Mutant A or B, see Fig.1) that were defective for sterol-regulated transcription (Fig. 2), the CREB-DNA complex was not formed (Fig.3 A, lanes 8–9 and11–12). Using a probe with a single mutation in the SRE I 5′, but outside of the CRE, resulted in a decrease in the shifted complex observed in the presence of CREB (Fig. 3 A, lanes 5and 6), indicating bases outside the concensus CRE are important in recruiting CREB to the promoter. Similar results were observed when we used a recombinant version of the CREB family member ATF-3 (data not shown). SREBP-1a bound to the wild type probe (Fig. 3 B, lanes 2 and3) and this was significantly decreased when a critical base in the SRE element was mutated (Fig. 3 B, lanes 5 and6). More importantly, SREBP bound efficiently to the probes containing either CRE mutation (Fig. 3 B, lanes 8–9 and11–12). Therefore, the mutations within the CRE of the HMG-CoA synthase promoter decrease the binding of CREB (and possibly other related family members), but not SREBP-1a. Taken together, the transfection results and the DNA binding assays suggest that the recruitment of CREB, or another related protein, is critical for sterol-regulated transcription of the HMG-CoA synthase promoter. To determine which transcription factors are simultaneously required for maximal activation of mammalian promoters, it is possible to take advantage of a Drosophila tissue culture cell line, SL2. This cell line does not express functional homologues for several mammalian proteins, including the transcription factors Sp1 (25Courey A.J. Tjian R. Cell. 1988; 55: 887-898Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1075) Google Scholar) and NF-Y/CBF. 2M. M. Magaña and T. F. Osborne, manuscript in preparation. Therefore, it is a useful cell-based assay system for the analysis of transcription factor requirements for promoter activation because it provides a negative background for such studies. For example, this assay system was used to directly show that SREBP and Sp1 function as co-activators of the LDL receptor promoter (11Sanchez H.B. Yieh L. Osborne T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1161-1169Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). To directly evaluate the ability of SREBP, NF-Y/CBF, and CREB/ATF, or various combinations thereof, to activate the HMG-CoA synthase promoter, we used the SL2 assay system (Fig.4). The wild type synthase promoter-reporter construct was co-transfected along with increasing amounts of a Drosophila expression construct for human CREB (Fig. 4 A). CREB, either alone or together with expression constructs for all three subunits of NF-Y/CBF, was unable to activate the promoter. Expression of SREBP-1a and the NF-Y/CBF plasmids together resulted in only a very slight activation of the synthase promoter in the absence of CREB. However, addition of increasing amounts of CREB along with constant levels of both SREBP-1a and NF-Y/CBF resulted in a dramatic increase in promoter activity. Inclusion of expression constructs for all three subunits of NF-Y/CBF was required for this activation.2 The effect of CREB was specific and dependent on the consensus CRE, as there was no activation observed for the CRE mutant promoter-reporter construct even when all three proteins were co-expressed (Fig.4 B). The results in Fig. 4 C show that the CREB/ATF family member ATF-2 also functions with SREBP and NF-Y/CBF to activate transcription of the HMG-CoA synthase promoter, although the level of activation was not as high as that observed in the presence of CREB. This may be due to inherent differences in activation potential between the two proteins, or simply due to differences in expression levels of CREB and ATF-2 from the pPac expression vectors in SL2 cells. Again, this effect was specific, since the LDL receptor promoter-reporter construct, which does not contain NF-Y/CBF or CREB sites, was unaffected (Fig. 4 D). These results support the hypothesis that efficient transcriptional activation of the HMG-CoA synthase promoter requires SREBP, NF-Y/CBF, and CREB (or other members of the CREB/ATF family) to be present simultaneously. How do SREBP and CREB function, together with NF-Y/CBF, to achieve sterol-regulated transcription? In an attempt to address this issue, we evaluated whether SREBP-1a and CREB could interact with each other in solution in the absence of DNA. CREB was expressed as a GST fusion protein, and immobilized on glutathione-agarose beads which was then incubated with purified, recombinant SREBP-1a. SREBP-1a was either loaded directly on an SDS-PAGE gel (Fig. 5, lane 1) or material eluted from GST-agarose beads after incubation with either the recombinant GST protein (Fig. 5, lane 2) or with the recombinant GST-CREB fusion protein (Fig. 5, lane 3). The SDS-PAGE gel was then analyzed by immunoblotting with an antibody directed against SREBP-1. Recombinant SREBP-1a bound specifically to the GST-CREB fusion protein. Thus, SREBP-1a and CREB are capable of interacting with each other in solution in the absence of a DNA fragment containing adjacent binding sites for the two proteins. In response to cellular sterol deprivation, the HMG-CoA synthase gene is activated at the transcriptional level primarily through the action of SREBPs. However, in all SREBP target promoters studied to date, including the HMG-CoA synthase promoter, recruitment of additional, nonspecific transcriptional activators to the promoter is required to achieve this activation (10Jackson S.M.

Chem. 1997; 272: 10295-10302Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The HMG-CoA synthase promoter has a complex array of cis-acting regulatory elements, each with the potential for involvement in sterol-regulated transcription. In the current studies, we show that the consensus CRE, located within the minimal regulatory region of the promoter, is essential for sterol-regulated transcription. In a previous report from our laboratory, it was demonstrated that this element mediated transcriptional activation of the synthase promoter in response to phorbol esters and the AP-1 transcription factor (28Vallett S.M. Osborne T.F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 5184-5189Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Here, we have demonstrated that this element recruits CREB to the promoter, and mutations that abolish CREB binding also result in a loss of sterol-regulated transcription (Figs. 2 and 3). Although other cholesterogenic promoters contain consensus CREs, to date this is the first promoter shown to require a CREB/ATF factor for the regulation of transcription in response to cellular sterol levels. We have previously shown that the two SREs and the CCAAT box are required for sterol-regulated transcription (12Dooley K.A. Millinder S. Osborne T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1349-1356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar) of the HMG-CoA synthase promoter. However, as demonstrated here, these elements are necessary but not sufficient for sterol-regulated transcription. This is based on two observations: 1) single point mutations in the CRE result in a loss of sterol-regulated transcription, even in the presence of the intact SREs and CCAAT box (Fig. 2); and 2) in aDrosophila SL2 assay system, maximal transcriptional activation is achieved only in the presence of all three proteins, SREBP, NF-Y/CBF, and CREB (Fig. 4 A). This observation is further unique in that the HMG-CoA synthase promoter is the first in which three factors, SREBP and two different general factors, are necessary for efficient transcriptional activation in response to sterol deprivation. CREB is a member of a large family of basic leucine zipper proteins called the CREB/ATF family that consists of at least 10 distinct members (22Lee K.A.W. Masson N. Biochem. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1174: 221-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 29Meyer T.E. Habener J.F. Endocr. Rev. 1993; 14: 269-290PubMed Google Scholar). CREB, the first member to be cloned, was originally identified based on its ability to bind to a cis-acting element termed the CRE, which was known to confer cAMP responsiveness on corresponding promoters (16Montminy M. Bilezikjian L.M. Nature. 1987; 328: 175-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (960) Google Scholar). Subsequently, CREB has been suggested to activate transcription in response to various other cellular signaling agents, as well, including insulin, growth factors, and calcium (30Klemm D.J. Roesler W.J. Boras T. Colton L.A. Felder K. Reusch J.E.-B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 917-923Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 31Xing J. Ginty D.D. Greenberg M.E.

In some cases, CREB alone is not sufficient, and additional transcription factors are required to achieve activation. For example, in the PEPCK promoter, the CRE functions together with a CCAAT box to achieve cAMP-mediated transcriptional activation (14Short J.M. Wynshaw-Boris A. Short H.P. Hanson R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 9721-9726Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whereas in the T-cell receptor α gene, the T-cell specific factor TCF-1α must function together with a CRE-binding protein and the ETS-1 protein to achieve activation (33Winoto A. Baltimore D. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 729-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Another example is the cell specific expression of the somatostatin promoter. Using the cell line Tu6, it was shown that this cell-restricted expression requires the concerted action of an islet cell-specific LIM family protein Isl-1, CREB (34Leonard J. Palle S. Gonzalez G. Edlund T. Montminy M.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6247-6251Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), and a NF-Y/CBF-like protein (35Vallejo M. Penchuk L. Habener J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12876-12884Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The functional differences among the various CREB/ATF proteins are not completely clear at present. Although they are all highly similar in their basic and leucine zipper regions and they bind the same cis-acting consensus sequence, the affinities of the different homo- and heterodimeric combinations vary for different CREs (36Hai T. Curran T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 3720-3724Crossref PubMed Scopus (1103) Google Scholar, 37Benbrook D. Jones N. Oncogene. 1990; 5: 293-302Google Scholar). Furthermore, they do not all respond to the same cellular signals. For example, ATF-2 mediates activation by the adenovirus E1a protein (38Liu F. Green M.R. Cell. 1990; 61: 1217-1224Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar), whereas both CREB and ATF-1 mediate activation in response to elevated cAMP (18Gonzalez G.A. Montminy M.R. Cell. 1989; 59: 675-680Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2044) Google Scholar, 39Rehfuss R.P. Walton K.M. Loriaux M.M. Goodman R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 18431-18434Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We tested the ability of ATF-2 to substitute for CREB in activation of the HMG-CoA synthase promoter. Although in an in vitro binding assay ATF-2 was able to bind to the CRE with the same specificity as we observed for CREB, 3K. A. Dooley and T. F. Osborne unpublished observations. it was unable to activate the HMG-CoA synthase promoter to the same level as that achieved with CREB (Fig. 4). It is possible that this result is due to a difference in expression levels of ATF-2 and CREB in SL2 cells, but this is unlikely since in similar experiments ATF-2 was more effective than CREB in activating transcription from the HMG-CoA reductase promoter.2 Interestingly, in the cAMP-independent cell type-specific expression of the somatostatin promoter mentioned above (34Leonard J. Palle S. Gonzalez G. Edlund T. Montminy M.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6247-6251Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), ATF-2 was also unable to substitute for CREB. As more is understood about the functions of the various CREB/ATF proteins, the reason for this difference will become clearer. In almost all eukaryotic promoters, multiple DNA binding transcription factors must assemble on the promoter, together forming a transcriptionally active complex. In many cases, this complex is composed of a combination of regulatory-specific transcriptional activators such as SREBPs, together with more ubiquitous, generic, transcription factors. The functions of the individual components can include enhanced recruitment of other required factors (either by direct physical interaction or by alteration of DNA structure of nearby cis-acting elements), presentation of distinct and complimentary activation domains, and/or distinct interactions with essential components of the basal, RNA polymerase II transcription machinery. We previously reported that SREBP physically interacts with NF-Y/CBF (12Dooley K.A. Millinder S. Osborne T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1349-1356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar), and another report demonstrated that NF-Y/CBF enhanced the binding of SREBP to the SRE in the promoter for farnesyl diphosphate synthase, another enzyme of cholesterol biosynthesis (40Ericsson J. Jackson S.M. Edwards P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24359-24364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Here we have shown that SREBP-1a physically interacts with CREB (Fig. 5). Interestingly, mutations that introduce insertions between the SRE I 3′ and the SRE I 5′/CRE are defective for sterol-regulated transcription in transient transfection assays.3 The reason for this is unclear, as yet, but may reflect the importance of a requirement for this protein-protein interaction between SREBP and CREB when they are recruited to the promoter. Further experiments are required to determine the mechanistic significance of this interaction. How does the SREBP family of transcription factors mediate the regulation of numerous genes involved in distinct but related metabolic processes such as fatty acid metabolism, cholesterol synthesis, and cholesterol uptake? Promoter specific effects of the different SREBP isoforms is likely to provide part of the basis for regulatory specificity (41Pai J. Guryev O. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26138-26148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Additionally, the differences in promoter architecture result in a requirement for unique combinatorial arrangements of transcription factors that are required for activation of the various SREBP target genes. This is also likely to provide part of a mechanism by which coordinate, yet specific, regulation is achieved. The involvement of CREB in activation of the HMG-CoA synthase gene, for example, may add a further level of complexity to its regulation, relating the responsiveness to sterol deprivation with other cellular regulatory events.

Both Nck and Grb4 proteins could associate with receptor tyrosine kinases and the SH3-binding proteins PAK, Sos1, and PRK2, and they synergized with v-Abl and Sos to induce gene expression via the transcription factor Elk-1. Although neither protein was transforming on its own, both Nck and Grb4 cooperated with v-Abl to transform NIH 3T3 cells and influenced the morphology and anchorage-dependent growth of wild type Ras-transformed cells.

Nature. 1995; 373: 573-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (2222) Google Scholar). Many of these phosphotyrosine-binding proteins are effector enzymes,e.g. phospholipase Cγ, the protein phosphatases SHP-1 and SHP-2, and p120 RasGAP (1Pawson T. Nature. 1995; 373: 573-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (2222) Google Scholar). However, R-PTKs also bind to a number of adapter proteins that lack enzymatic activity and contain SH3 in addition to SH2 domains. Through SH3 domains, adapter proteins can bind to proline-rich motifs in downstream effectors, often recruiting them into multiprotein complexes at the plasma membrane. The adapter protein Grb2, for example, has the domain structure SH3-SH2-SH3 and can bind to proline-rich sequences in the Ras guanine nucleotide exchange factor, Sos, recruiting it to the plasma membrane, where it triggers the Ras-ERK pathway (2Schlessinger J.

Although the physiological significance of most of these interactions is undetermined, several of the above SH3 binding partners (PAK, PRK2, and the Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein) appear to be downstream effectors of Rho family GTPases (18Quilliam L.A. Lambert Q.T. Mickelson-Young L.A. Westwick J.K. Sparks A.B. Kay B.K. Jenkins N.A. Gilbert D.J. Copeland N.G. Der C.J. J. Biol.

Biochem. 1996; 242: 171-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Because Rho proteins have been implicated in cytoskeletal reorganization (29Hall A. Science. 1998; 279: 509-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (5200) Google Scholar), Nck may be responsible for coupling R-PTK activation to cytoskeletal regulation. In support of this notion, the Drosophila homolog of Nck, DOCK, is located in photoreceptor growth cones and is involved in axonal guidance (30Garrity P.A. Rao Y. Salecker I. McGlade J. Pawson T. Zipursky S.L. Cell. 1996; 85: 639-650Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Use of dominant inhibitory SH domain mutants has also implicated Nck in dorso-ventral axis development during Xenopus embryogenesis (31Tanaka M. Lu W. Gupta R. Mayer B.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4493-4498Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The nck gene is located at a chromosomal break point associated with a variety of cancers (32Huebner K. Kastury K. Druck T. Salcini A.E. Lanfrancone L. Pelicci G. Lowenstein E. Li W. Park S.H. Cannizzaro L. Pelicci P.G. Schlessinger J. Genomics. 1994; 22: 281-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), and Nck has been reported to weakly transform rodent fibroblast cell lines (5Li W. Hu P. Skolnik E.Y. Ullrich A. Schlessinger J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5824-5833Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 33Chou M.M. Fajardo J.E. Hanafusa H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5834-5842Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), also implicating it in oncogenesis. In 1992, a partial mouse cDNA that encoded for an SH2 domain and part of an SH3 domain was isolated from a bacterial expression library and designated Grb4 (34Margolis B. Silvennoinen O. Comoglio F. Roonprapunt C. Skolnik E. Ullrich A. Schlessinger J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 8894-8898Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). The predicted amino acid sequence shared 74% identity with human Nck. It was not clear from this original study whether the partial grb4 cDNA encoded the mouse ortholog of Nck or a separate protein. Here we demonstrate that grb4is, indeed, a unique human gene. Isolation of the full-length humangrb4 cDNA showed that Grb4 shares the same SH domain composition and is 69% identical to Nck. Like Nck, Grb4 bound to Sos, PAK, and Prk2 and to activated growth factor receptors. Both Nck and Grb4 cooperated with v-Abl, Ha-Ras(WT), and Sos1 to modulate cell morphology and transformation and to induce gene expression via the Elk-1 transcription factor. These findings suggest that Nck and Grb4 may be functionally redundant. A human brain Marathon-ready cDNA library (CLONTECH) was used to isolate full-lengthgrb4. The 5′-end of the gene was amplified using polymerase chain reaction with anchor primers provided with the library and nestedgrb4 primers located within the middle SH3 domain. Due to difficulty obtaining the complete 3′-end of the clone by rapid amplification of cDNA ends, we used further nested grb4primers to isolate a central portion and specific primers to polymerase chain reaction amplify the 3′ coding region. The grb4fragments were subcloned into pCR2.1 (Invitrogen) and sequenced. Full-length grb4 was generated by ligation using existing restriction sites within the three overlapping fragments. Full-length nck cDNA (4Lehmann J.M. Riethmuller G. Johnson J.P. Nucleic Acids Research. 1990; 18: 1048Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar) or a 266-base pair fragment of grb4 spanning base pairs −44 to +222 were radiolabeled with [α-32P]dCTP using a random-priming DNA labeling kit (Boehringer Mannheim) as outlined by the manufacturer. Two human multitissue Northern blots (CLONTECH) were probed overnight with each individual fragment in hybridization solution (5× SSPE, 10× Denhardt's solution, 100 mg/ml denatured sheared salmon sperm DNA, 2.0% SDS plus 50% formamide) at 42 °C. Blots were then washed extensively in 2× SSC, 0.05% SDS at room temperature followed by two 20-min washes in 0.1× SSC, 0.1% SDS at 50 °C. The blots were exposed at −80 °C with intensifying screens. Cos, NIH 3T3, and SV40-immortalized mouse embryo fibroblast cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone) or, for NIH 3T3 cells, in 10% calf serum (Colorado Serum Company or Life Technologies, Inc.). Transforming focus and soft agar assays were performed as described (35Clark G.J. Cox A.D. Graham S.M. Der C.J. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 255: 395-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Activation of Elk-1 was determined by co-transfection of cells with both Gal4-Elk-1 and Gal4-Luc constructs. Gal4-Elk-1 encodes a fusion protein containing the Gal4 DNA binding domain together with the transactivation domain of Elk-1 (containing ERK phosphorylation sites). Gal4-Luc encodes the luciferase gene driven by a minimal promoter containing tandem Gal4 DNA binding sites (36Marais R. Wynne J. Treisman R. Cell. 1993; 73: 381-393Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1104) Google Scholar). NIH 3T3 cells were cotransfected with 125 ng of Gal4-Elk-1, 2.5 μg of Gal4-Luc, and 1 μg of pSRαMSVtkneo(v-abl) (provided by A. M. Pendergast, Duke University), 2 μg of pZIP (37Cepko C.L. Roberts B.E. Mulligan R.C. Cell. 1984; 37: 1053-1062Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar), 2 μg of pZIP(nck), 2 μg of pZIP(grb4), or 0.67 μg of pZIP(sos1) as indicated. 24 h posttransfection, cells were serum-starved (0.5%) overnight, lysed, and analyzed for luciferase activity essentially as described (38Hauser C.A. Westwick J.K. Quilliam L.A. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 255: 412-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). For transient overexpression of Prk2 and PAK proteins, 100-mm plates of 50% confluent Cos cells were transfected with 6 μg of either pFLAG-CMV2(prk2) (18Quilliam L.A. Lambert Q.T.

Sos1 was stably overexpressed from pRC-bac(sosF*) (39Aronheim A. Engelberg D. Li N. al-Alawi N. Schlessinger J. Karin M. Cell. 1994; 78: 949-961Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar) in NIH 3T3 cells. Confluent plates of cells were lysed in 1 ml lysis buffer consisting of 20 mmTris, pH 7.4, 50 mm NaCl, 0.5% IGEPAL CA-630, 5 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 19 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm Na3VO4, and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Cell lysates were cleared by microcentrifugation for 10 min at 4 °C. GST fusion proteins of Nck, Grb4, or a control GST (containing the 40 C-terminal amino acids of Prk2) were expressed in BL21-DE3(lysE) bacteria as described (18Quilliam L.A. Lambert Q.T. Mickelson-Young L.A. Westwick J.K. Sparks A.B. Kay B.K. Jenkins N.A. Gilbert D.J. Copeland N.G. Der C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28772-28776Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). 2–10 μg of glutathione-agarose bead-bound protein was tumbled with 0.5 ml of each individual cell lysate for 3 h at 4 °C. Beads were then washed twice with the above lysis buffer and once with phosphate-buffered saline. Protein was solubilized by boiling in 2× Laemmli buffer, and 50% of the resultant sample from Prk2- or Sos-incubated GST fusion proteins was separated by SDS-PAGE (7% gel). Because PAK co-migrated with the GST-Nck and GST-Grb4 fusion proteins during SDS-PAGE separation, bead-bound fusion proteins incubated with lysate from cells overexpressing PAK were further incubated for 30 min at room temperature with a peptide representing residues 6–21 of PAK1 to specifically release bound PAK into the solution. 50% of the supernatant from this competition was separated by SDS-PAGE (8% gel). Using human cDNA as a template, individual SH2 domains of Grb2 (codons 57–154), Nck (codons 275–377), and Grb4 (codons 278–388) were generated by polymerase chain reaction and subcloned into pGEX-2T. Glutathione-agarose bead-bound GST fusion proteins of the SH2 domains were prepared as described above. Mouse embryo fibroblasts (40Shi Z.Q. Lu W. Feng G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4904-4908Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) were serum-starved for 48 h prior to stimulation with EGF (100 ng/ml, Upstate Biologicals Inc.) or PDGF-AA (50 ng/ml, Collaborative Biomedical Products) for the indicated times and lysed in 50 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 100 mm NaF, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate. 25% of the lysate from a confluent 100-mm plate was then incubated with 5 μg of GST-fused SH2 domain proteins or full-length GST adapter proteins, as indicated, for 2 h at 4 °C. The bead-bound proteins were washed as described above. The proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE (10% gel) and detected using the anti-phosphotyrosine antibody, PY99. Cos cells were transfected with pFLAG-CMV2(nck) or pFLAG-CMV2(grb4) together with pRC-bac(sosF*) using LipofectAMINE. After 48 h, cells were lysed as above, and tagged Nck and Grb4 were immunoprecipitated with 3 μg of M2 anti-FLAG antibody. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and co-precipitated Sos1 detected by Western blotting using anti-Sos antibody. Proteins separated by SDS-PAGE were transferred onto Immobilon-P polyvinylidene fluoride membrane (Millipore) and blocked for 1 h at room temperature with 5% milk powder in TBS-Tween 20 (Tris-buffered saline, 0.05% polyoxyethylene-sorbitan monolaurate) or, in the case of phosphorylated tyrosine detection, with 3% bovine serum albumin in TBS-Tween 20. All antibody dilutions and wash steps were performed in TBS-Tween 20. Primary antibody incubations were for 1 h at room temperature with indicated antibodies. Secondary incubations were done for 30 min at room temperature with antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Anti-Nck antibody was from Pharmingen, anti-HA tag antibody was from Berkeley Antibody Co., anti-FLAG (M2) was from Sigma, anti-Sos was from Transduction Laboratories, and PY99 was from Santa Cruz Biotech. Other anti-Nck sources included Transduction Laboratories and Upstate Biotechnology. COS cells were transiently transfected with pFLAG-CMV2(nck) or (grb4) or pCGN HA-taggedgrb2. After 24 h, cells were incubated overnight in phosphate-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, supplemented with 0.5% dialyzed fetal bovine serum and 1.25 mCi of32PO4 (NEN). Cells were stimulated for 10 min with 50 μm forskolin/0.2 mm isobutyl methylxanthine, Me2SO, 1 μm phorbol myristate acetate, or 10% FBS, washed two times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and lysed in the above lysis buffer supplemented with 10 mm NaF, 0.1 mm ZnCl2, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 10 mm β glycerol phosphate, and 10 mm p-nitrophenyl phosphate. After clarification (microcentrifugation for 10 min at 14,000 rpm) lysates were immunoprecipitated with 3 μg of anti-FLAG or anti-HA antibody. Proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE (8%). The gel was Coomassie-stained, dried, and exposed to Amersham Pharmacia Biotech ECL film for 4 h. Ha-Ras(Q61L)-transformed NIH 3T3 cells were metabolically labeled overnight with 250 μCi of [35S]cysteine/methionine (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) per 60-mm plate in cysteine/methionine-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum that had been dialyzed against 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4. Cell monolayers were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in 150 mm NaCl, 1% IGEPAL CA-630, 0.25% deoxycholate, 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 5 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 19 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm Na3VO4, and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The lysate was cleared by microcentrifugation and then tumbled with 20 μg of the indicated GST fusion proteins on glutathione-agarose beads for 3 h at 4 °C. Beads were then washed three times with lysis buffer and once with phosphate-buffered saline. 0.5 ml of each protein sample was separated by SDS-PAGE (7% gel) and then fixed and stained with 0.25% Coomassie Blue to confirm equal loading of GST fusion proteins. The gel was soaked in Amplify (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), dried, and exposed to film for 48 h at −80 °C. Sequence homology between human nck and a partial mousegrb4 cDNA isolate indicated that grb4 could either be the mouse ortholog of nck or a separate, related gene (34Margolis B. Silvennoinen O. Comoglio F. Roonprapunt C. Skolnik E. Ullrich A. Schlessinger J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 8894-8898Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Human expressed sequence tags, as well as an additional partial cDNA clone, 2B. K. Kay, personal communication. supported the notion that grb4 was a separate gene. Therefore, to obtain the full-length Grb4 cDNA, we screened a human brain library using polymerase chain reaction/rapid amplification of cDNA ends (see under “Materials and Methods”). Like Nck, Grb4 consisted of three N-terminal SH3 domains and a C-terminal SH2 domain with short linker regions. The two proteins share 69% identity, with most divergence occurring in the regions between the SH domains (Fig.1). An in-frame stop codon was located just 5′ of the presented sequence, indicating that the Grb4 N terminus does not extend beyond that of Nck. Indeed, significant homology between the nck and grb4 5′ untranslated regions supports a common ancestry. Overall Nck has slightly more identity with the Xenopus Nck homolog than does Grb4, whereas theDrosophila protein is somewhat more divergent (Fig. 1). Because Nck and Grb4 shared such a high degree of homology within their functional SH domains, we anticipated that they might serve similar functions in different tissues. We looked for differential expression of nck/grb4 mRNAs in a panel of 16 human tissues using commercially available Northern blots. Surprisingly, both nck and grb4 messages were almost ubiquitously expressed (Fig. 2). This apparent ubiquitous expression pattern was not due to cross-hybridization of the probes because their messages were of distinct sizes (the nck mRNA was slightly smaller). Furthermore, there were slight variations in abundance of the major transcripts in different tissues, most notably pancreas and thymus. The broad tissue distribution of nck was consistent with previously findings (5Li W. Hu P. Skolnik E.Y. Ullrich A. Schlessinger J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5824-5833Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). We next tested the two adapter proteins to see whether the minor deviations in SH domain sequence might impart differential binding properties. Incubation of GST fusions of SH domain adapter proteins with lysates from [35S]methionine-labeled NIH 3T3 cells revealed that, although distinct from that of Grb2, the binding profiles of Nck and Grb4 were similar to each other (Fig.3 A). The SH3 domains of Nck have been shown to bind to a number of target proteins, such as Sos, PAK, and PRK2, all of which contain proline-rich peptide sequences (14Lu W. Katz S. Gupta R. Mayer B.J.

We therefore addressed whether GST-Grb4 would also interact with these molecules. Recombinant Grb4 was found to precipitate FLAG-tagged PRK2 and Myc-tagged PAK1 from cell lysates with similar efficacy to Nck (Fig. 3 B). Sos1 could also be co-immunoprecipitated by FLAG-tagged Grb4 or Nck from Cos cell lysates. The SH2 domain of Nck binds to a number of activated growth factor receptors and their substrates (5Li W.

Grb4 and Nck interacted with a similar pattern of phosphotyrosine-containing proteins. 3L. E. Braverman and L. A. Quilliam, unpublished observations. To look more specifically at interaction with these proteins, serum-starved mouse embryo fibroblasts were challenged with EGF or PDGF prior to incubation of lysates with glutathione bead-immobilized full-length adapter proteins or isolated SH2 domains. As shown in Fig. 3 C, the SH2 domains of Grb2, Nck, and Grb4 all precipitated activated EGF and PDGF receptors with similar efficiency. Nck has been reported to be phosphorylated on multiple sites (primarily Ser/Thr residues) following agonist stimulation (5Li W. Hu P. Skolnik E.Y. Ullrich A. Schlessinger J. Mol. Cell.

Examination of the Nck sequence revealed that most consensus phosphorylation sites are located between the SH domains, where Grb4 and Nck are most divergent. Following 32PO4labeling of Cos cells transiently overexpressing FLAG-tagged Nck or Grb4, both molecules were heavily phosphorylated, even in the absence of challenge with forskolin/IBMX (Fig.4), serum, or phorbol myristate acetate.3 Therefore, although the regions between the SH3 domains share less homology, both proteins are still susceptible to phosphorylation. Indeed, three consensus PKA phosphorylation sites are conserved in the region between the first and second SH3 domains of Nck and Grb4 (see Fig. 1). No such sites were present in the epitope tag. Nck has been reported to activate Ras and or Ras-induced phenomena by binding the Ras guanine nucleotide exchange factor, Sos, and replacing the role of Grb2 in mediating growth factor-induced recruitment of Sos to the site of Ras activation (22Hu Q. Milfay D. Williams L.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1169-1174Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because Sos could co-precipitate with Nck and Grb4, we looked at the ability of these adapters to stimulate transcriptional activation via Elk-1 that is located downstream of the Ras/ERK cascade. In these assays, we co-transfected cells with a plasmid encoding the tyrosine kinase v-Abl to provide an upstream initiating signal (45Gibbs J.B. Marshall M.S. Scolnick E.M. Dixon R.A. Vogel U.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 20437-20442Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 5, co-transfection of NIH 3T3 cells with Grb2 augmented the transcriptional activity induced by v-Abl. Nck and Grb4 also enhanced the ability of Abl to induce luciferase expression, and although the effect of these adapter proteins was less than that seen with Grb2, they had similar potency to each other, suggesting a common mode of action. None of the adapter plasmids enhanced luciferase activity when transfected in the absence of v-Abl. Because PAK has been implicated in Ras-independent ERK activation (14Lu W. Katz S. Gupta R.

We have discovered that, as part of this process, the synthetic glucocorticoid dexamethasone strongly and reversibly down-regulated the expression of fascin, an actin-bundling protein that also interacts with the adherens junction component β-catenin. Ectopic constitutive expression of full-length mouse fascin containing a Myc epitope tag (Myc-fascin) in Con8 cells inhibited the dexamethasone stimulation of transepithelial electrical resistance, disrupted the induced localization of the tight junction protein occludin and the adherens junction protein β-catenin to the cell periphery, and prevented the rearrangement of the actin cytoskeleton. Ectopic expression of either the carboxyl-terminal 213 amino acids of fascin, which includes the actin and β-catenin-binding sites, or the amino-terminal 313 amino acids of fascin failed to disrupt the glucocorticoid induction of tight junction formation. Mammary tumor cells expressing the full-length Myc-fascin remained generally glucocorticoid responsive and displayed no changes in the levels or protein-protein interactions of junctional proteins or the amount of cytoskeletal associated actin filaments. However, a cell aggregation assay demonstrated that the expression of Myc-fascin abrogated the dexamethasone induction of cell-cell adhesion. Our results implicate the down-regulation of fascin as a key intermediate step that directly links glucocorticoid receptor signaling to the coordinate control of junctional complex formation and cell-cell interactions in mammary tumor epithelial cells.

Palade G.E. J. Cell Biol. 1963; 17: 375-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (2144) Google Scholar). The more apically located tight junction serves as a selective barrier to the paracellular diffusion of solutes and thereby separates the apical and basolateral fluid compartments of the epithelial cell monolayer (2Stevenson B.R.

By limiting the lateral movement of plasma membrane lipids and proteins, the tight junction also contributes to the maintenance of cellular polarity, physically defines the border between the apical and basolateral plasma membrane surfaces (2Stevenson B.R.

In this study, we demonstrate that the glucocorticoid down-regulation of fascin protein expression is a critical event for this steroid to induce the organization of the apical junctional complex which provides, for the first time, a direct functional link between a steroid regulated gene and the control of cell-cell interactions.

Treatment of Con8 cells with glucocorticoids was done by the addition of the glucocorticoid agonist, dexamethasone (Sigma), at a final concentration of 10−6m (prepared as a 10−3m stock in ethanol) to normal growth media unless otherwise indicated. The formation of tight junctions was monitored by measuring TER on filter grown cells using an EVOM Epithelial Voltohmmeter (World Precision Instruments, Sarasota, FL) as described previously (60Buse P.

To prepare cells for immunofluorescence, cells were fixed with 100% methanol at −20 °C for 30 min, and subsequently dried with 100% acetone at −20 °C for 5 min. Filters were incubated with a blocking buffer (1% non-fat dry milk in 0.5% Triton X-100, 5 mm EDTA, 0.15 m NaCl, and 20 mm HEPES, pH 7) before incubation with the primary antibodies. Rabbit anti-occludin antibodies (8Wong V. Gumbiner B.M. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 399-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar) and anti-β-catenin (gifts of Barry M. Gumbiner, Sloan Kettering), rabbit anti-fascin antibodies (42Tao Y.S. Edwards R.A. Tubb B. Wang S. Bryan J. McCrea P.D. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 1271-1281Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar), rabbit anti-actin antibodies (Sigma), and mouse anti-c-Myc epitope antibodies (Zymed Laboratories Inc., San Francisco, CA) were all used at a 1:1000 dilution. Secondary fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-rabbit and Texas Red-conjugated anti-mouse antibodies were purchased from Molecular Probes, Inc. (Eugene, OR) and used at a 1:100 dilution. Stained cells were mounted with SlowFadeTM Light Antifade reagent (Molecular Probes, Inc.) and stored at 4 °C before visualization. For Western blot analyses, cells were rinsed twice in phosphate-buffered saline (BioWhittaker), and extracted directly in SDS-PAGE (polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis) sample buffer (50 mm Tris-HPO4, pH 6.8, 2.5 mm EDTA, 15% sucrose, 2% SDS, and 50 mm dithiothreitol) containing protease inhibitors (5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml pepstatin A, 1 μg/ml TLCK, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 20 μg/ml aprotinin, 50 μg/ml antipain, 2 mm benzamidine, 50 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, and 2.5 mmiodoactamide). Samples were boiled for 15 min and cooled to room temperature before the addition of 1 m iodoacetic acid to a final concentration of 125 mm. SDS-PAGE was performed using the Mini-protein II cell electrophoresis unit (Bio-Rad) according to the manufacturer's guidelines. After electrophoresis, proteins were electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Micron Separations Inc., Westboro, MA) using the Mini Trans-Blot electrophoretic transfer cell (Bio-Rad) according to manufacturer's guidelines. The blots were incubated with blotting buffer (5% non-fat dry milk, 0.15 m NaCl, 0.2% Triton X-100) before probing with a 1:1000 dilution of primary antibodies (anti-occludin, anti-β-catenin, anti-E-cadherin, anti-α-catenin, anti-fascin, or anti-c-Myc epitope). The mouse monoclonal anti-fascin antibody (gift of DAKO Corp., Carpinteria, CA) was obtained as a crude supernatant of hybridoma media and was not diluted prior to use. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit and anti-mouse antibodies (Bio-Rad) were used as secondary probes, and the blots were developed by an ECL kit (Amersham Life Sciences, Inc.). For the examination of co-immunoprecipitated proteins, each 100-mm2plate of confluent Con8 cells was extracted in 5 ml of 1% Tween 20 buffer (1% Tween 20, 0.15 m NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4) in the presence of protease inhibitors (5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml pepstatin A, 1 μg/ml TLCK, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 20 μg/ml aprotinin, 50 μg/ml antipain, 2 mm benzamidine, 50 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, and 2.5 mm iodoactamide). Extraction was carried out on ice for 30 min and all samples were precleared by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 15 min before immunoprecipitation. Co-immunoprecipitation was performed with Protein A-Sepharose CL-4B (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) in the presence of rabbit anti-β-catenin or preimmune serum at 4 °C for 4 h. Immunoprecipitates were washed five times in the same immunoprecipitation buffer, followed by a final wash with phosphate-buffered saline. Co-immunoprecipitated proteins were solubilized immediately in SDS-PAGE sample buffer and prepared for SDS-PAGE as described above for Western blotting. The Triton X-100 extraction method (74Dharmawardhane S. Warren V. Hall A.L. Condeelis J. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1989; 13: 57-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) was employed to determine level of F-actin and the amount of cytoskeleton-associated fascin and β-catenin. The mammary tumor cells were grown to confluency and treated with or without 1 μm dexamethasone for 96 h. The cells were then trypsinized into a single-cell suspension, counted using a hemacytometer, and then 2 million cells collected into a pellet by centrifugation. After aspirating the media, each cell pellet was detergent extracted by suspension in 1 ml of lysis buffer (0.5% Triton X-100, 20 mm PIPES, pH 6.8, 2 mmMgCl2, 50 mm KCl, 5 mm EGTA, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm ATP, and 1 μg/ml each of leupeptin, pepstatin, and aprotinin) and then immediately centrifuged at 8,700 × g in a microcentrifuge for 3 min. The resulting pellets (containing the Triton X-100-resistant proteins) were suspended in 100 μl of 20 mm phosphate buffer (14.8 mm NaH2PO4 and 5.2 mm K2HPO4, pH 7.0, and 1 μg/ml each of leupeptin, pepstatin, and aprotinin). A parallel set of cells was centrifuged and then directly suspended in 100 μl of 20 mm phosphate buffer and represents the total cell extracts. For the Western blots, the Triton X-100-resistant proteins and total cell extracts were dissolved in an equal volume of 2 × SDS-PAGE sample buffer (described above) and the proteins electrophoretically fractionated by SDS-PAGE. The full-length mouse fascin tagged with a 6X c-Myc epitope at its NH2 terminus was cloned into the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3 (Invitrogen), which drives the inserted cDNA by the CMV promoter and contains the neomycin resistance gene. Mammalian expression vectors for the NH2-terminal fragment of mouse fascin containing amino acids 1–313 and the COOH-terminal fragment of mouse fascin containing amino acids 281 to 493 each tagged with a 6X c-Myc epitope at the NH2 terminus were cloned into the pCS2+MT mammalian expression vector. The fascin sequences in this expression vector are driven by the simian CMV IE94 promoter and the vector backbone of pCS2 is pBluescript KS+ (75Rupp R.A. Snider L. Weintraub H. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1311-1323Crossref PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar,76Turner D.L. Weintraub H. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1434-1447Crossref PubMed Scopus (954) Google Scholar). Plasmid DNA was expanded in XL-1 Escherichia colicells and purified with a plasmid purification kit (Qiagen, Inc., Chatsworth, CA). The pcDNA3-fascin, pCS2+MT NH2-terminal fascin, and the pCS2+MT COOH-terminal fascin DNA were introduced into Con8 cells at 24 h after plating of cells at 30% confluency. One set of cells was also transfected with the pCS2+MT vector alone. In transfections with the pCS2+MT based vectors, the cells were co-transfected with the neomycin resistance gene driven by the CMV promoter. Transfection of cells was performed using LipofectAMINE reagent according to the manufacturer's protocol (Life Technologies, Inc., Gaithersburg, MD). Potential expressors were selected at 600 μg/ml G418 (Life Technologies, Inc.), which was cytotoxic to >99% of parental Con8 cells. Single clones were isolated, expanded, and Myc-fascin expression was assessed by antigen blotting with either the anti-fascin or anti-Myc epitope antibodies. Multiple fascin expressing clonal cell lines derived from the parental Con8 cells were analyzed in parallel to control for clonal variation. The mammary tumor cells expressing high levels of full-length Myc-fascin are f/3.1, f/3.8, and f/3.11, of the NH2-terminal portion of Myc-fascin are FN12 and FN36, and of the COOH-terminal portion of Myc-fascin are FC10 and FC12. The f/3.4, f/3.3, and f/3.2 cells do not express Myc-fascin although the original transfected contained the full-length Myc-fascin gene. The C1 cells were transfected with the pCS2+MT expression vector without any fascin sequences. Parental Con8 and mouse fascin-expressing and control transfected Con8 cell lines that were treated with or without dexamethasone (10−6mfor 4 days) were evaluated using an aggregation assay. To obtain cells for aggregation assays, each 100-mm2 plate of confluent cells was rinsed twice in phosphate-buffered saline, and subsequently incubated with 0.25% trypsin (Sigma) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 for 1 h at 37 °C in a 5% CO2atmosphere. After an hour of trypsinization, all cells were detached from the culture plate and subsequently collected by centrifugation at 10 × g for 15 min in 45 ml of fresh Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12. Cells were resuspended gently by pipetting in 5 ml of fresh growth media (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 containing 10% calf serum). The presence of 10% calf serum in the cell suspension inhibits the activity of resid"

The transformed phenotype can be reversed by interfering with the function of the IGF-IR. The IGF-IR is required for transformation by a number of viral and cellular oncoproteins, including SV40 large T antigen, Ras, Raf, and Src. The IGF-IR is a substrate for Src in vitro and is phosphorylated in v-Src-transformed cells. We observed that the IGF-IR and IR associated with the C-terminal Src kinase (CSK) following ligand stimulation. We found that the SH2 domain of CSK binds to the tyrosine-phosphorylated form of IGF-IR and IR. We determined the tyrosine residues in the IGF-IR and in the IR responsible for this interaction. We also observed that fibroblasts stimulated with IGF-I or insulin showed a rapid and transient decrease in c-Src tyrosine kinase activity. The results suggest that c-Src and CSK are involved in IGF-IR and IR signaling and that the interaction of CSK with the IGF-IR may play a role in the decrease in c-Src activity following IGF-I stimulation.

Hongo A. Rubini M. Prisco M. Valentinis B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1332: F105-F126Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar). Each heterodimer contains an extracellular subunit, the α subunit, responsible for ligand binding and a transmembrane subunit, the β subunit, which contains the protein-tyrosine kinase activity in its intracellular domain. When IGF-I binds to the IGF-IR, the receptor becomes autophosphorylated on several tyrosine residues. Phosphorylation of the receptor allows interactions with phosphotyrosine binding or Src homology 2 (SH2) domain-containing proteins, thereby transducing signals to downstream effectors. Insulin receptor substrate 1 and 2 (IRS-1 and IRS-2) and Shc are major substrates of the IGF-IR that subsequently bind other SH2 domain-containing proteins, including the p85 subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3′-kinase, the adaptor proteins, Grb2 and Nck, the protein-tyrosine-phosphatase, Shp 2, and the C-terminal Src kinase, CSK (2Backer J.M.

Src family kinases have been implicated in insulin and IGF-I signaling pathways. For example, it has been reported that tyrosine-phosphorylated IRS-1 binds to Fyn (24Sun X.J. Pons S. Asano T. Myers Jr., M.G. Glasheen E. White M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10583-10587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), and the β subunit of the IGF-IR is phosphorylated by Src in v-Src-transformed cells (25Kozma L.M. Weber M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 3626-3634Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The c-Src protein has a domain organization consisting of an N-terminal Src homology (SH) 4 domain containing a myristoylation and membrane localization signal, followed by a unique domain, SH3 and SH2 domains, the catalytic SH1 domain, and the C-terminal tail (see Ref. 13Brown M.B. Cooper J.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1287: 121-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (1085) Google Scholar for review). c-Src kinase activity is regulated by phosphorylation of two tyrosine residues, Tyr416, the autophosphorylation site, and Tyr527 in the C-terminal tail, as well as by SH2 and SH3 domain-mediated interactions. The three-dimensional structure of c-Src helps explain the regulatory interactions (26Xu W. Harrison S.C. Eck M.J. Nature. 1997; 385: 595-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (1252) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of Tyr527 creates a binding site for the Src SH2 domain, locking the molecule in an inactive state. The SH3 domain contributes to the stability of the inactive state by interacting with a “linker” that joins the SH2 and catalytic domains. The compact organization pushes the two lobes of the catalytic domain together, disabling the active site. CSK, the C-terminal Src kinase, is a ubiquitously expressed cytoplasmic protein-tyrosine kinase. Its organization resembles that of Src, including an SH3, SH2, and a catalytic domain (27Nada S. Okada M. MacAuley A. Cooper J.A. Nakagawa H. Nature. 1991; 351: 68-72Crossref Scopus (511) Google Scholar, 28Sabe H. Knudsen B. Okada M. Nada S. Nakagawa H. Hanafusa H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 2190-2194Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). However, CSK lacks the catalytic domain autophosphorylation site, the C-terminal regulatory tyrosine, and the N-terminal myristoylation signal of Src. CSK phosphorylates Src Tyr527, down-regulating Src kinase activity (27Nada S. Okada M. MacAuley A. Cooper J.A. Nakagawa H. Nature. 1991; 351: 68-72Crossref Scopus (511) Google Scholar, 29Okada M. Nakagawa H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 20886-20893Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The regulation of CSK activity is not well understood. Several studies (30Howell B.W. Cooper J.A. Mol.

A. 1992; 91: 3984-3988Crossref Scopus (213) Google Scholar) have suggested that relocalization of CSK allows the molecule to phosphorylate Src C-terminal tyrosine. Howell and Cooper (30Howell B.W. Cooper J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5402-5411Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) suggested a model in which CSK would interact with Src substrates via its SH3 or SH2 domain in order to down-regulate Src activity. The observations that IGF-IR is a substrate of Src in v-Src-transformed cells and that IGF-IR expression is required for Src-mediated transformation in mouse fibroblasts suggested that Src might participate in IGF-IR signaling. In this study, we observed that CSK bound to the IGF-IR in vitro and in vivo. By using a yeast two-hybrid system to characterize the IGF-IR-CSK interaction, we found that the CSK SH2 domain interacted with Tyr943 and Tyr1316 of the IGF-IR. By contrast, the CSK SH2 domain interacted only with Tyr1322 of the insulin receptor (IR). We further observed that Src kinase activity was rapidly decreased following IGF-I and insulin stimulation of human or mouse fibroblasts. Therefore, CSK is a new interacting protein of the IGF-IR and the IR. Our observations suggest a role for CSK and c-Src in IGF-IR and IR signaling. pCLXSN-hIGF-IR was constructed as described previously. 2C. Arbet-Engels, R. Janknecht, and W. Eckhart, submitted for publication. Hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged wild type CSK was generated by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using convenient cloning sites for insertion into the pEF-HA vector. HA-tagged CSK mutant S109C was made using the QuickChange procedure (Stratagene) from wild type CSK subcloned into pBluescript followed by subcloning into the pEF-HA vector.

Lysates were precleared with formalin-fixedStaphylococcus aureus (Pansorbin) (Calbiochem) by centrifugation at 4 °C for 20 min at 14,000 rpm. For co-immunoprecipitation studies, SDS and sodium deoxycholate were omitted from the lysis buffer. Similar amounts of lysate (about 1 ml), adjusted to contain equal amounts of protein (0.5–1.0 mg), were incubated with 1 μg of antibody for 2 h at 4 °C. For c-Src immunoprecipitation, rabbit anti-mouse secondary antibody was added for an additional 30 min. Protein A-agarose (Repligen) was added for 1 h at 4 °C and washed 3 times with lysis buffer at 4 °C. Immune complexes were boiled for 5 min in sample buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 20% β-mercaptoethanol) and separated on a 10% SDS acrylamide gel. After gel electrophoresis, proteins were transferred to Immobilon polyvinylidene fluoride membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA) using a semi-dry transfer apparatus (Acrylictech) for 90 min at 200 mA. The membranes were blocked overnight at 4 °C in TBS-T (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20) containing 5% bovine serum albumin. The membranes were incubated with primary antibodies at room temperature for 2 h in TBS-T plus 5% bovine serum albumin, washed in the same buffer without bovine serum albumin, and incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody for 1 h.

Oncogene. 1997; 14: 17-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), was added to the beads. After 15 min at 30 °C the reaction was stopped by adding 2× sample buffer and analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The conditions used in this study are in the linear range of the assay according to Cooper et al. (38Cooper J.A. Esch F.S. Taylor S.S. Hunter T. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 7835-7841Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The presence of equivalent amounts of enolase was verified by Coomassie staining of the gel and equivalent amounts of K297R Src by immunoblotting. Finally, the gel was dried and protein phosphorylation revealed by autoradiography. Tryptic phosphopeptide mapping and cyanogen bromide cleavage were done according to Boyle et al. (40Boyle W.J. van der Geer P. Hunter T. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 110-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (1276) Google Scholar). The yeast expression plasmids pBTM116 and pLexA-lamin were provided by A. Vojtek (Seattle) (see Ref.41Vojtek A.B. Hollenberg S.M. Cooper J.A. Cell. 1993; 74: 205-214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1663) Google Scholar) and J. Camonis (Paris, France), respectively. The yeast expression plasmid encoding the Gal4 activation domain (AD) pACTII was fromCLONTECH (Palo Alto, CA). The cytoplasmic domains of the IR and IGF-IR, subcloned in pBTM116 in frame with the DNA binding domain of LexA, were described previously (9Tartare-Deckert S. Murdaca J. Sawka-Verhelle D. Holt K.H.

Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Wiley Interscience, New York1992Google Scholar). When necessary, PCR using thermostablePfu polymerase (Stratagene) was performed to generate adequate cloning sites to allow the in-frame insertion into the two-hybrid plasmids. The rat IRS-1 cDNA (a gift from J. Pierce, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda) (residues 5–1235) was cloned in frame with the Gal4 AD. The full-length human CSK cDNA was PCR-amplified from pGST-CSK (35Neet K. Hunter T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4908-4920Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) and fused to the Gal4 AD-encoding sequence in pACTII. The different subdomains of CSK (SH3/2, SH3, and SH2 constructs) were PCR-amplified from pACTII CSK and fused to pACTII. All point mutations of different proteins were generated by site-directed mutagenesis using the TransformerTM Kit (CLONTECH). Mutations were verified by DNA sequencing. The two-hybrid system used in this study was described previously (41Vojtek A.B. Hollenberg S.M. Cooper J.A.

Biol Chem. 1995; 270: 23456-23460Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The yeast strain L40, which is MATa, trp1, leu2, his3, LYS2::lexA-HIS3,URA3::lexA-lacZ, was provided by A. Vojtek (Seattle) and J. Camonis (Paris, France). Growth conditions and yeast maintenance were as described previously (44Guthrie C. Fink G.R. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 12-18Google Scholar). Yeast L40 was transformed simultaneously with the two indicated plasmids by the lithium acetate method of Gietz et al. (45Gietz D. St. Jean A. Woods R.A. Schiestl R.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 1425-1426Crossref PubMed Scopus (2898) Google Scholar). The transformants were grown on plates lacking tryptophan and leucine to select for the pBTM116 and pACTII derivatives, respectively. After 3 days at 30 °C, 3 colonies of each transformation were tested for histidine prototrophy after plating on medium lacking tryptophan, leucine, and histidine and for β-galactosidase activity using a liquid assay, performed essentially as described previously (46Bartel P.L. Chien C.-T. Sternglanz R. Fields S. Hartley D.A. Cellular Interactions in Development: A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, Oxford1993: 153-179Google Scholar). In brief, 1 ml of yeast cell extract was incubated with the substrateo-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactopyranoside, and the increase in A 420 was measured after 10 or 30 min (47Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972Google Scholar).

To examine the role of c-Src or CSK in IGF-I and insulin signaling, we tested whether c-Src or CSK associated with the IGF-IR in co-immunoprecipitation studies. First, using several different conditions, we tried to co-immunoprecipitate c-Src with the IGF-IR. We were unable to detect c-Src in IGF-IR immunoprecipitates or the IGF-IR in c-Src immunoprecipitates (data not shown). Then, we tested whether CSK could be co-immunoprecipitated with the IGF-IR. Human 293 cells were starved for 24 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 0.1% FCS and stimulated with IGF-I. In these experiments we used an analog of IGF-I, LR3-IGF-I, which is not bound and sequestered by IGF-binding proteins (48Francis G.L. Ross M. Ballard F.J. Milner S.J. Senn C. McNeil K.A. Wallace J.C. King R. Wells J.R.E. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 8: 213-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). We confirmed that LR3-IGF-I activates the IGF-IR by immunoprecipitating the IGF-IR from stimulated cells and immunoblotting the receptor with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (see Fig.1 B). IGF-IR immunoprecipitates were tested for the presence of CSK by immunoblotting with anti-CSK antibodies. As shown in Fig. 1 A (upper panel), CSK was detected in association with the IGF-IR in stimulated cells but not in unstimulated cells. The amount of CSK bound to the IGF-IR compared with the total amount present in 293 fibroblasts, estimated from immunoprecipitation of CSK from the remaining lysates after the IGF-IR immunoprecipitation, represented approximately 5% of total cellular CSK (Fig. 1 A, lower panel). To study further the association between CSK and the IGF-IR, 293 cells were cotransfected with IGF-IR and CSK cDNAs, incubated for 24 h, starved for a further 24 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 0.1% FCS, and stimulated for various times with IGF-I. As shown in Fig. 1 B, CSK was detected in association with the IGF-IR only in stimulated cells. The association was rapid, occurring within 1 min of addition of IGF-I. The IGF-IR also became phosphorylated on tyrosine within 1 min after stimulation with IGF-I. Similar amounts of IGF-IR were present in immunoprecipitates at all time points. To characterize further the CSK-IGF-IR interaction, we tested whether the IGF-IR could be observed in CSK immunoprecipitates. Since co-immunoprecipitation of CSK with the IGF-IR was observed only after IGF-I stimulation (Fig. 1 A), suggesting that tyrosine phosphorylation of the IGF-IR was required for IGF-IR-CSK association, we also tested whether the interaction depended on a functional SH2 domain of CSK. Human 293 cells were cotransfected with the IGF-IR and a vector encoding either wild type CSK or a CSK mutant with a defect in the FLVRES motif of the SH2 domain, CSK S109C, which fails to bind phosphotyrosine-containing proteins (35Neet K. Hunter T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4908-4920Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Both CSK wild type and the CSK S109C mutant contained a hemagglutinin epitope tag allowing them to be separated from the endogenous CSK protein during immunoprecipitation. The transfected cells were incubated, starved, and stimulated with IGF-I as described above. HA-CSK immunoprecipitates made with the 12CA5 anti-HA antibody were assayed for the presence of the IGF-IR by immunoblotting. As shown in Fig. 1 C, IGF-IR was not observed in unstimulated immunoprecipitates. IGF-IR was present in wild type CSK immunoprecipitates from IGF-I-stimulated cells but not in CSK immunoprecipitates of the CSK S109C mutant, defective in SH2 domain binding to phosphotyrosine. We conclude that CSK associatesin vivo with the IGF-IR. Furthermore, the interaction requires a functional SH2 domain of CSK and occurs only after activation of the receptor by IGF-I. To characterize further the association between the IGF-IR and CSK and to compare the IGF-IR and the IR with regard to the sites required for CSK binding, we used the yeast two-hybrid system of Fields and Song (49Fields S. Song O. Nature. 1989; 340: 245-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (4875) Google Scholar). This system has been used to study the interaction of the IGF-IR and the IR with their two major substrates, IRS1 and Shc, in yeast (42Tartare-Deckert S. Sawka-Verhelle D. Murdaca J. Van Obberghen E. J. Biol Chem. 1995; 270: 23456-23460Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Tyrosine phosphorylation of these receptors in the yeast two-hybrid system has been demonstrated previously (42Tartare-Deckert S. Sawka-Verhelle D. Murdaca J. Van Obberghen E. J. Biol Chem. 1995; 270: 23456-23460Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Constructs encoding the intracytoplasmic domain of the IGF-IR or the IR fused to the DNA binding domain of LexA, and full-length CSK fused to the transcriptional activation domain of Gal4 (GAD) were used. Interaction between the LexA-receptor hybrid and the CSK-GAD hybrid in the yeast strain stimulates transcription of two reporter genes, HIS3and lacZ, which are flanked upstream by LexA-binding sites.

https://openalex.org/W2079190492,"The generation of mice strains deficient for select members of the signaling complex of the 55-kDa tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNF-R55) has allowed the assignment of specific cellular responses to distinct TNF-R55-associated proteins. In particular, the TNF-R55-associated protein FADD seems to be responsible for recruitment and subsequent activation of caspase 8. In this report we demonstrate the requirement of FADD for TNF-induced activation of endosomal acid sphingomyelinase (A-SMase). In primary embryonic fibroblasts from FADD-deficient mice the activation of A-SMase by TNF-R55 ligation was almost completely impaired. This effect is specific in that other TNF responses like activation of NF-κB or neutral (N-)SMase remained unaffected. In addition, interleukin-1-induced activation of A-SMase in FADD-deficient cells was unaltered. In FADD−/− embryonic fibroblasts reconstituted by transfection with a FADD cDNA expression construct, the TNF responsiveness of A-SMase was restored. The results of this study suggest that FADD, in addition to its role in triggering a proapoptotic caspase cascade, is required for TNF-induced activation of A-SMase.

Today. 1995; 16: 294-297Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Through binding to the 55-kDa TNF receptor (TNF-R55), TNF rapidly activates two distinct forms of SMase, a membrane-associated neutral (N-)SMase and an acid (A-)SMase (3Wiegmann K. Schütze S.

Chem. 1995; 270: 27179-27185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar) and in the endosomal-lysosomal compartment. Each type of SMase hydrolyzes the phosphodiester bond of sphingomyelin to yield the neutral lipid second messenger ceramide and phosphorylcholine. Studies on TNF receptor signaling suggested a model that clarifies how distinct SMases might function through ceramide in diverse pathways (3Wiegmann K. Schütze S. Machleidt T. Witte D. Krönke M.

Using mutants of the cytoplasmic domain of TNF-R55, we have shown previously that specific receptor domains link to different sphingomyelinases. The activation of N-SMase is signaled by a cytoplasmic portion of TNF-R55 containing a small motif of 9 amino acid residues at position 310–318 that is both necessary and sufficient for activation of N-SMase (5Adam D.

This region was termed NSD for neutralsphingomyelinase activation domain. The domain of TNF-R55 activating the A-SMase pathway strikingly corresponds to the death domain signaling the cytotoxic effects of TNF (1Kolesnick R.N. Krönke M. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1998; 60: 643-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (721) Google Scholar, 7Tartaglia L.A. Ayres T.M. Wong G.H. Goeddel D.V. Cell. 1993; 74: 845-853Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1159) Google Scholar). The molecular mode of action of the death domain has been extensively investigated. The death domain of TNF-R55 binds an adaptor protein, TRADD, that in turn recruits at least three further proteins, TRAF2, FADD, and RIP (for review, see Ref. 8Wallach D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 107-109Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). The emerging picture based on studies of many investigators indicates that TRAF2 mediates the activation of the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) (9Yeh W.C. Shahinian A. Speiser D. Kraunus J. Billia F. Wakeham A. de la Pompa J.L. Ferrick D. Hum B. Iscove N. Ohashi P. Rothe M. Goeddel D.V. Mak T.W.

Lowe S.W. Goeddel D.V. Mak T.W. Science. 1998; 279: 1954-1958Crossref PubMed Scopus (799) Google Scholar). We have obtained evidence recently that neither TRAF2 nor RIP affected A-SMase activation (15Schwandner R. Wiegmann K. Bernardo K. Kreder D. Krönke M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5916-5922Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). In contrast, overexpression of TRADD and FADD in 293 cells enhanced TNF-induced A-SMase activation without changing the basal level of A-SMase enzymatic activity. Strikingly, overexpression of the FADD-associated caspase 8 does not lead to enhanced A-SMase activation after TNF treatment, indicating that the apoptotic cascades initiated by caspase 8 segregate from the A-SMase activation pathway. Enzyme kinetic analysis revealed that the observed enhancement of A-SMase activation by TRADD and FADD is due to an increased maximal velocity of substrate hydrolysis rather than a higher affinity for the substrate sphingomyelin. Here we further delineate the role of FADD for TNF-induced activation of A-SMase. Using embryonic fibroblasts from FADD-deficient mice, we provide evidence for a stringent requirement of FADD for TNF-induced activation of A-SMase. Primary embryonic fibroblasts (EF) were derived from embryos at day 9.5 of gestation as described previously (14Yeh W.C. Pompa J.L. McCurrach M.E. Shu H.B. Elia A.J. Shahinian A. Ng M. Wakeham A. Khoo W. Mitchell K. El-Deiry W.S. Lowe S.W. Goeddel D.V. Mak T.W. Science. 1998; 279: 1954-1958Crossref PubMed Scopus (799) Google Scholar). EF cells were cultured in high glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (ICN) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 10 mm glutamine, and 50 μg/ml each of streptomycin and penicillin in a humidified incubator at 5% CO2. Highly purified recombinant human TNF (3 × 107 units/mg) was kindly provided by Dr. G. Adolf, Bender, Vienna, Austria. Mammalian cell expression vectors encoding FADD cDNA were kindly provided by Dr. V. Dixit, Genentech, San Francisco. The expression vector pRK-FADD was generated by inserting aSalI-HindIII fragment of FADD cDNA into the pRK5 vector. For transient expression experiments, 1.5 × 106 EF cells were seeded on 100-mm dishes (Falcon, 3803). Cells were transfected the following day by the calcium phosphate precipitation method (16Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Kingston R.E. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley and Sons Inc., New York1994: 9.1.4-9.1.6Google Scholar). After 9 h of incubation, cells were harvested, and enzymatic SMase assays were performed. The micellar SMase assay using exogenous radiolabeled sphingomyelin was performed as described previously (3Wiegmann K. Schütze S. Machleidt T. Witte D. Krönke M. Cell. 1994; 78: 1005-1015Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (672) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were treated in triplicate in 0.5 ml of medium with 100 ng/ml human recombinant TNF for the indicated periods of time. To measure A-SMase, cells were homogenized in 0.2% Triton X-100 lysis buffer. Radioactive phosphorylcholine produced from [N-methyl-14C]sphingomyelin (labeled in the choline moiety, 47 mCi/mmol, NEN Life Science Products) was determined in the aqueous phase by liquid scintillation counting. EF cells were transfected with 1.5 μg of expression constructs or vector control. Cells were harvested the next day and left untreated or stimulated with 10 ng/ml TNF for 20 min at 37 °C. Cells were washed two times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and nuclear extracts were prepared and analyzed by electrophoretic mobility shift assays as described (17Adam D. Kessler U. Krönke M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17482-17487Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Primary EF cells obtained from FADD−/−, FADD+/−, or FADD+/+ mice were stimulated with TNF and assayed for A-SMase activity. As shown in Fig.1, TNF did not enhance A-SMase activity in FADD−/− EF cells within the time frame investigated. These results suggest that FADD is indispensable for TNF-induced A-SMase activation. In contrast, the A-SMase activation profile of FADD+/− EF cells was unaltered when compared with wild-type EF cells. Because the amplitude and kinetics of A-SMase activation were not diminished in FADD+/− cells, we conclude that FADD is not a rate-limiting factor for A-SMase activation in wild-type fibroblasts. TNF treatment of FADD-deficient EF cells resulted in activation of N-SMase (Fig. 2 A) and NF-κB (Fig. 2 B), which was indistinguishable from TNF-stimulated wild-type EF cells. These findings indicate that FADD-independent TNF signaling pathways are intact. Furthermore, like TNF, IL-1 readily induced NF-κB in FADD−/− EF cells, which provides further evidence that the status of FADD deficiency does not establish a general unresponsiveness of EF cells. Unlike TNF, IL-1-induced activation of A-SMase in FADD−/− EF cells, which was similar in terms of amplitude and kinetics to that observed with heterozygous FADD+/− or wild-type EF cells (Fig.3). Thus, IL-1 stimulates activation of A-SMase in a FADD-independent manner. Information about the molecular mechanisms of IL-1-induced activation of A-SMase is sparse. Recently, we reported that an accessory chain of the IL-1 receptor, IL-1RAcP, is required for both IL-1 internalization and activation of A-SMase (18Hofmeister R. Wiegmann K. Korherr C. Bernardo K. Krönke M. Falk W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27730-27736Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The functional domain of IL-1RAcP responsible for A-SMase activation has not yet been mapped. Neither has a putative IL-1RAcP-associated protein been identified that mediated A-SMase activation. At any rate, FADD, in general, does not seem to play a role in IL-1 receptor signaling. This is consistent with the unaltered A-SMase activation observed in IL-1-treated FADD-deficient EF cells. In order to provide further pertinent evidence for the essentiality of FADD for the TNF-induced A-SMase activation pathway, FADD−/− EF cells were transiently transfected with a FADD cDNA expression vector. As shown, Fig.4 A, FADD-transfected cells responded to TNF with approximately half-maximal A-SMase activation when compared with FADD-deficient cells stimulated with IL-1 for control. This partial A-SMase response corresponded well with the transfection efficiency, which ranged from 35 to 45% as judged from parallel transfection with a GFP expression plasmid (not shown). In TNF-stimulated FADD-deficient EF cells, transfected with an empty vector for control, the changes of A-SMase activity were not significant as inferred from the respective S.E. In addition, results obtained from different independent experiments did not reveal a significant increment of A-SMase activity (Fig. 4 B and data not shown). When different amounts of FADD expression vector were transfected into FADD−/− EF cells, a dose-dependent increase of A-SMase activation was observed (Fig. 4 B). Thus, the A-SMase responsiveness to TNF in FADD-deficient EF cells can be reconstituted by transfection with FADD expression plasmids. Together, the results of this study indicate that FADD is an essential member of the TNF-induced A-SMase activation pathway. The question then arises how FADD signals A-SMase activation. More specifically, how does the FADD-derived signal cross the membrane bilayer to target the endosomal A-SMase. Caspase 8 does not appear to mediate FADD activation of A-SMase (15Schwandner R. Wiegmann K. Bernardo K. Kreder D. Krönke M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5916-5922Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), and A-SMase is not a target for caspase 8 proteolytic cleavage. Rather, recent evidence suggests that internalization of TNF-R55 is required for A-SMase activation (19Schütze S. Machleidt T. Adam D. Schwandner R. Wiegmann K. Kruse M.L. Heinrich M. Wickel M. Krönke M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; (in press): 274Google Scholar). While the formation of TNF-R55-containing endosomes brings together TNF-R55 and A-SMase at the same subcellular compartment, TRADD and FADD will stay at the cytoplasmic face of the endosomal membrane, which does not allow any direct physical interaction between A-SMase and TRADD or FADD. Thus, TRADD and FADD may either activate a cytosolic enzyme that generates a lipid messenger able to cross the endosomal membrane. Alternatively, TRADD and FADD may simply serve to stabilize a TNF-R55 multimer to allow activation of A-SMase through the extracellular domains of TNF-R55 located in the endosomal lumen. Further studies will be necessary to address in detail the molecular mechanisms of FADD-mediated A-SMase activation. It is well established that FADD can interact through a C-terminal death domain with DD-containing proteins like CD95, TRADD, and death receptor 3 (DR3). This interaction unmasks a N-terminal death effector domain of FADD resulting in the recruitment and activation of caspase 8 triggering an apoptotic caspase cascade (20Muzio M. Chinnaiyan A.M. Kischkel F.C. O'Rourke K. Shevchenko A. Ni J. Scaffidi C. Bretz J.D. Zhang M. Gentz R. Mann M. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. Dixit V.M. Cell. 1996; 85: 817-827Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2712) Google Scholar). Using FADD-deficient EF cells, Yeh et al. (14Yeh W.C. Pompa J.L. McCurrach M.E. Shu H.B. Elia A.J. Shahinian A. Ng M. Wakeham A. Khoo W. Mitchell K. El-Deiry W.S. Lowe S.W. Goeddel D.V. Mak T.W. Science. 1998; 279: 1954-1958Crossref PubMed Scopus (799) Google Scholar) demonstrated recently that FADD is essential for signaling TNF-R55-, CD95-, or DR3-induced apoptosis. Remarkably, FADD was also found to be essential for mouse embryo development in particular for the ventricular myocardium. The lethality of FADD-deficient mice contrasts with the phenotypically normal embryonic development and viability of CD95- and TNF-R55-deficient mice (21Adachi M. Suematsu S. Kondo T. Ogasawara J. Tanaka T. Yoshida N. Nagata S. Nat. Genet. 1995; 11: 294-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar, 22Pfeffer K. Matsuyama T. Kündig T.M. Wakeham A. Kishihara K. Shahinian A. Wiegmann K. Ohashi P.S. Krönke M. Mak T.W. Cell. 1993; 73: 457-467Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1529) Google Scholar). This led to the conclusion that FADD, besides its signaling function for death receptors, may also be used by other receptors regulating embryonic development. In addition, the early lethality of FADD-deficient embryos points to physiologic functions of FADD other than caspase 8 activation. In the present study we identify A-SMase as a further FADD-dependent enzyme, indicating that FADD, indeed, may couple to signaling systems distinct from caspase 8. Although A-SMase has been implicated in numerous cellular responses including apoptosis (for review, see Ref. 1Kolesnick R.N. Krönke M. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1998; 60: 643-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (721) Google Scholar), A-SMase can be viewed an “orphan” enzyme, whose precise role in signaling transduction has become elusive. Notably, A-SMase-deficient mice do not show early embryonic lethality (23Horinouchi K. Erlich S. Perl D.P. Ferlinz K. Bisgaier C.L. Sandhoff K. Desnick R.J. Stewart C.L. Schuchman E.H. Nat. Genet. 1995; 10: 288-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar, 24Otterbach B. Stoffel W. Cell. 1995; 81: 1053-1061Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Thus the effects of FADD deficiency on embryogenesis cannot be explained by a lack of A-SMase activation. Further investigations are needed to clarify the role of FADD and A-SMase in nonapoptotic signaling. We thank Dave Goeddel for helpful suggestions and providing reagents and Vishva Dixit for the FADD expression vector."
https://openalex.org/W2083233478,"Site-directed mutagenesis has been employed to study the mechanism of hydride transfer from NADPH to NADPH-cytochrome P450 oxidoreductase. Specifically, Ser457, Asp675, and Cys630 have been selected because of their proximity to the isoalloxazine ring of FAD. Substitution of Asp675 with asparagine or valine decreased cytochromec reductase activities 17- and 677-fold, respectively, while the C630A substitution decreased enzymatic activity 49-fold. Earlier studies had shown that the S457A mutation decreased cytochromec reductase activity 90-fold and also lowered the redox potential of the FAD semiquinone (Shen, A., and Kasper, C. B. (1996) Biochemistry 35, 9451–9459). The S457A/D675N and S457A/D675N/C630A mutants produced roughly multiplicative decreases in cytochrome c reductase activity (774- and 22000-fold, respectively) with corresponding decreases in the rates of flavin reduction. For each mutation, increases were observed in the magnitudes of the primary deuterium isotope effects with NADPD, consistent with decreased rates of hydride transfer from NADPH to FAD and an increase in the relative rate limitation of hydride transfer. Asp675substitutions lowered the redox potential of the FAD semiquinone. In addition, the C630A substitution shifted the pK a of an ionizable group previously identified as necessary for catalysis (Sem, D. S., and Kasper, C. B. (1993)Biochemistry 32, 11539–11547) from 6.9 to 7.8. These results are consistent with a model in which Ser457, Asp675, and Cys630 stabilize the transition state for hydride transfer. Ser457 and Asp675interact to stabilize both the transition state and the FAD semiquinone, while Cys630 interacts with the nicotinamide ring and the fully reduced FAD, functioning as a proton donor/acceptor to FAD.

The current study explores the roles of Cys630 and Asp675 of NADPH-cytochrome P450 oxidoreductase in catalysis and FAD reduction and shows that the three residues Ser457, Asp675, and Cys630 interact to form the catalytic site for hydride transfer from NADPH to FAD. Expression and purification of recombinant NADPH-cytochrome P450 oxidoreductase was carried out as described previously (16Shen A.L. Porter T.D. Wilson T.E. Kasper C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 7584-7589Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), except that cultures were grown and induced at 28 instead of 37 °C. Protein was assayed by the BCA method (22Smith P.K.

Steady-state kinetic parameters were determined in the presence of 0.27 m potassium phosphate, pH 7.7. The D675N and C630A mutants were constructed by the method of Kunkel (25Kunkel T.A. Ausubel F.M.

The D675V mutant was prepared by PCR (26Higuchi R. Ehrlich H. PCR Technology. Stockton Press, New York1989: 61-70Crossref Google Scholar), using the following oligonucleotides: D675V, GGGTCCTAGGTCCTAGCTCCACACAACTAGTGAGTA; 1858, GTGTGAGCTGCTGCCACGCC. The D675V oligonucleotide contains the indicated mutation and an AvrII site for cloning of the mutant fragment. PCR reactions contained 10 mm Tris, pH 8.3, 50 mm KCl, 6.5 mm MgCl2, 0.001% gelatin, 200 μm of each dNTP, 10 μg/ml template DNA, 1 μm D675V mutagenic oligonucleotide, 1 μm 1858 oligonucleotide (hybridizing to bases 5′ of the mutation site), and 0.05 units AmpliTaq polymerase (Perkin-Elmer, Foster City, CA). Reaction conditions were as follows: 94 °C, 1 min; 47 °C, 1 min; 72 °C, 2 min; 25 cycles, followed by extension for 5 min at 72 °C. Ampliwax (Perkin-Elmer) was used according to the manufacturer's instructions. After removal of free oligonucleotides by centrifugation through an M r100,000 cut-off filter (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA), PCR-amplified DNA fragments were digested with AvrII and NheI, purified by agarose gel electrophoresis, and cloned into pOR263. All mutant plasmids were characterized by restriction mapping and sequencing of the PCR-amplified regions and cloning sites. Sequencing was performed with the AmpliTaq cycle sequencing kit (Perkin-Elmer). Multiply substituted mutants were constructed by restriction enzyme digestion and cloning of the mutant fragments into pOR263 and confirmed by sequencing. For studies of the primary deuterium isotope effect, A-side NADPD was synthesized and purified by high performance liquid chromatography as described previously (18Shen A. Kasper C.B. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 9451-9459Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The fraction of deuteration was determined as described previously (27Sem D.S. Kasper C.B. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 12012-12021Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) and ranged from 0.8 to 0.9. Cytochromec assays for isotope effect studies were carried out in 10 mm potassium phosphate, 0.45 m KCl, pH 7.7 (I 1/2 = 478 mm). Primary deuterium isotope effects were determined by the method of direct comparison (28Cleland W.W. Adv.

Buffers were prepared as described previously (21Sem D.S. Kasper C.B. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 11539-11547Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Assays at pH 10, 10.5, and 11, were carried out in CAPS buffer. Data were fitted to Equations Equation 2, Equation 3, Equation 4, Equation 5 (30Cleland W.W. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 87: 390-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar) as follows, Y=Y01+(H/K1)+(K2/H)Equation 2 where Y is k cat ork cat/K mNADPH;H is the proton concentration; K 1 andK 2 are the acid dissociation constants for the acidic and basic groups, respectively; and Y 0 is the value of Y when both groups are in their preferred ionization state, Y=YH1+(H/K1)+(K2/H)+YL(K1/H)+1Equation 3 Y=(YL*(H/K1))+YH(H/K1)+1Equation 4 where Y is k cat ork cat/K mNADPH;H is the proton concentration; K 1 andK 2 are the acid dissociation constants for the acidic and basic groups, respectively; and Y H andY L are the values of Y at high and low pH, respectively, and Y=YM1+(H/K1)+(K2/H)+YH1+(H/K3)+(K2/H)Equation 5 where Y isk cat/K mNADPH, with a value of Y M at intermediate pH andY H at high pH, K 1 andK 3 are acid dissociation constants for the acidic groups, and K 2 is the acid dissociation constant for the basic group. Equation 2 describes a model where one acidic group must be unprotonated and one basic group must be protonated for maximum activity. Equation 3 describes a model similar to Equation 2 but which retains a lower level of activity upon protonation of the acidic group. Equation 4 describes a model in which a single group must be unprotonated for maximum activity. Equation 5 describes a model where two acidic groups, with different pK a values, must be unprotonated and one basic group must be protonated for maximum activity. Measurements of visible absorption spectra and anaerobic NADPH reduction rates and anaerobic NADPH titrations were carried out at 28 °C on a Beckman 7500 diode array spectrophotometer. Anaerobic reactions contained 50 mm Tris, pH 7.7, 10 mmglucose, 5u/ml glucose oxidase, 1 μm methyl viologen, and P450R at the concentrations indicated (31Iyanagi T. Makino N. Mason H.S. Biochemistry. 1974; 13: 1701-1710Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Cuvettes were sealed, and oxygen was removed by subjecting the samples to several cycles of evacuation followed by flushing with argon purified by passage through a scrubbing tower containing 0.5% dithionite, 0.1% 2-anthroquinone sulfonate, and 0.4% NaOH. Aerobic stopped-flow studies were carried out on an Olis RSM 100 rapid scanning spectrophotometer. Reactions were carried out in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.7, 28 °C, and data were fitted to the following equations, At=A0*e(−k1*t)Equation 6 At=(A0*e(−k1*t))+(A1*e(−k2*t))Equation 7 where A t is the absorbance at timet, and A 0 andA 1 are the initial absorbance values for the first and second phases of reduction, respectively. Fig. 1shows the visible absorption spectra of the oxidized wild-type and mutant reductases, with broad peaks at approximately 380 and 452 nm similar to that described for the rat liver enzyme (4Iyanagi T. Mason H.S. Biochemistry. 1973; 12: 2297-2307Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). The addition of NADPH under aerobic conditions to each of the proteins produced spectra characteristic of the air-stable semiquinone (FAD/FMNH⋅), with a decreased absorbance at 452 nm and a long wavelength absorbance band having a maximum at approximately 585 nm and a shoulder at 630 nm. None of the substitutions produced significant changes in the visible absorption spectra. This is in agreement with results of flavin analyses, which indicated no effect of any of the substitutions on FMN or FAD content. Substitution of any one of the three residues Ser457, Asp675, or Cys630produced large decreases in rates of reduction of cytochromec, which accepts electrons from FMN, and ferricyanide and AcPyrADP, each of which accepts electrons from FAD, suggesting that these mutations interrupt electron transfer from NADPH to FAD. Specific activities in the presence of 0.27 m potassium phosphate, pH 7.7, and saturating substrate concentrations are shown in TableI. The largest decrease in cytochromec reductase activity was produced by the D675V substitution, which had only 0.1% of wild-type activity. Activities with the substrates ferricyanide and AcPyrADP were decreased 85- and 39-fold, respectively. The D675N substitution, which retains hydrogen-bonding capacity, produced smaller effects, with only a 14-fold decrease in cytochrome c reductase activity and 15- and 5-fold decreases, respectively, in activities with the substrates ferricyanide and AcPyrADP. Substitution of Cys630 with alanine produced a 37-fold decrease in cytochrome c reductase activity and 30- and 13-fold decreases, respectively, in electron transfer to ferricyanide and AcPyrADP.Table ISpecific activities of active-site mutantsProteinSpecific activityaReactions were carried out in 0.27 mpotassium phosphate, pH 7.7, 28 °C. Cytochrome c assays contained 50 μm NADPH and 65 μm cytochromec. Ferricyanide assays contained 100 μm NADPH and 500 μm potassium ferricyanide.

Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 9451-9459Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Combination of the S457A mutation with substitutions at Asp675 and Cys630 produced multiplicative effects on cytochrome c reductase activities. Cytochromec reductase activity of the S457A/D675N double mutant was decreased ∼600-fold, while cytochrome c reductase activity of the S457A/D675N/C630A triple mutant was very close to background levels, with a calculated specific activity more than 4 orders of magnitude less than wild type. Ferricyanide reductase activity of the S457A/D675N mutant was decreased to 6% of wild type and AcPyrADP activity to 1% of wild type.

To assess the relative rate limitation of hydride transfer for the active-site mutants, the deuterium isotope effect on cytochromec reduction with [(4S-H),(4R-D)]NADPD was determined. In agreement with previously reported results (18Shen A. Kasper C.B. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 9451-9459Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 32Sem D.S. Kasper C.B. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 12768-12774Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), the wild-type deuterium isotope effect on V max was 2.7 at high (478 mm) ionic strength, with a similar isotope effect observed onV max/K mNADPH, consistent with hydride transfer being partially rate-limiting. Substitution of Asp675 increased the isotope effects onV max andV max/K mNADPH to values ranging from 4 to 7 (Table II). Although the activity of the C630A mutant was about 10% of wild type, the deuterium isotope effects on both V max andV max/K mNADPH were increased markedly, to approximately 10. The double substitution, D675N/S457A, produced isotope effects similar to those of the S457A single mutant. The pH dependence of wild-type k cat andk cat/K mNADPH has been previously shown to be dependent upon two ionizable groups. The first has a pK a of 6.2 at 850 mm ionic strength and 7.1 at 350 mm ionic strength, which must be unprotonated for maximum activity, while the other has a pK a of approximately 8.8, which must be protonated for maximum activity (21Sem D.S. Kasper C.B. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 11539-11547Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). To determine if these pK avalues could be attributed to one or more of these active-site residues, the pH dependence of k cat andk cat/K mNADPH with cytochrome c as the substrate was determined. Fig. 2 shows the pH dependence ofk cat andk cat/K mNADPH for the D675N, D675V, S457A/D675N, and C630A mutants.

In the present work, the murine matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9) gene was shown to contain 13 exons, and the 2.8-kilobase pair upstream region was found to contain several common promoter elements including a TATA box-like motif, three GC boxes, four AP-1-like binding sites, an AP-2 site, and three PEA3 consensus sequences that may be important for basic activity of the gene. In order to identify cell-specific regulatory elements, constructs containing varying lengths of the upstream region in front of a LacZ reporter gene were made and studied for expression in transgenic mice generated by microinjection into fertilized oocytes. Analyses of the mice revealed that the presence of sequences between −2722 and −7745 allowed for expression in osteoclasts and migrating keratinocytes,i.e. cells that have been shown to normally express the enzyme in vivo. The results represent the first in vivo demonstration of the location of cell-specific control elements in a matrix metalloproteinase gene and show that element(s) regulating most cell-specific activities of 92-kDa type collagenase are located in the −2722 to −7745 base pair region.

Takino T. Okada Y. Cao J. Shinagawa A. Yamamoto E. Seiki M. Nature. 1994; 370: 61-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (2367) Google Scholar, 23Will H. Hintzmann B. Eur. J.

The metalloproteinases are believed to have an important role in normal turnover of extracellular matrix and in remodeling of tissues. Furthermore, they have been shown to be highly expressed in areas of inflammation and tumor invasion. However, the specific roles of the various metalloproteinases in vivo as well as regulation of their genes are still largely unexplored. MMPs 2 and 9, which form a distinct subgroup of MMPs, based on their primary structure and substrate specificity, have been shown to have high activity against gelatin, and they also degrade type IV, V, and VII collagens. However, they do not show high activity against type I collagen, proteoglycan, or laminin. Despite the apparently identical substrate specificity, their temporal and spatial expression in vivo varies extensively, indicating that the two enzymes are required for different purposes. This is also emphasized by the different expression patterns of the two genes (21Huhtala P. Tuuttila A. Chow L. Lohi J. Keski-Oja J. Tryggvason K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16485-16490Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, MMP-2 is primarily expressed in stromal fibroblast-like cells during mouse development (25Reponen P. Sahlberg C. Huhtala P. Hurskainen T. Thesleff I. Tryggvason K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7856-7862Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), while its expression is insignificant in the stroma of adult mice. This suggests that MMP-2 has a major role in the remodeling of the stromal compartment, in addition to the proposed role in the turnover of basement membrane type IV collagen. In fact, it is possible that the enzyme mainly functions as a stromal gelatinase by removing gelatin derived from degraded fibrillar collagens. In invasive tumors, intense expression of MMP-2 is observed in stromal cells adjacent to the tumor front, not in the tumor cells themselves (26Poulsom R. Pignatelli M. Stetler-Stevenson W.G.

Pyke C. Breast Cancer Res. Treat. 1993; 24: 209-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). MMP-9 has a completely different expression pattern. By in situ hybridization analysis, its expression has been shown to be almost completely confined to osteoclasts at the site of bone formation during mouse development (30Reponen P. Sahlberg C. Munaut C. Thesleff I. Tryggvason K. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 1091-1102Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). This is the only known example of a highly osteoclast-specific proteinase, which indicates that the enzyme is important for the turnover of bone matrix, possibly as a gelatinase required for the removal of denatured collagen fragments (gelatin) generated by interstitial collagenases. MMP-9 expression has also been localized to keratinocytes of healing skin wound (31Salo T. Mäkelä M. Autio-Harmainen H. Larjava H. Lab. Invest. 1994; 70: 176-182PubMed Google Scholar), macrophages (27Pyke C. Ralfkiaer E. Huhtala P. Hurskainen T. Danø K. Tryggvason K. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 1336-1341PubMed Google Scholar,28Pyke C.

Dyn. 1995; 202: 388-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). We have previously shown that no cell-specific expression and regulation of the MMP-9 gene could be achieved through in vitro experiments using transiently transfected cells (35Munaut C. Reponen P. Huhtala P. Kontusaari S. Foidart J.M. Tryggvason K. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1994; 732: 369-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Therefore, to examine the regulation of the MMP-9 gene and, in particular, the regulatory mechanisms of its tissue expression, we have cloned and characterized the mouse gene and studied its regulation using transgenic mice. In this study, we demonstrated that the minimum element(s) required for expression in osteoclasts and migrating keratinocytes reside in the 5′-flanking region of the gene between 2.7 and 7.7 kb upstream of the transcription start site. Mouse genomic libraries cloned in the cosmid pWE15 (Stratagene, catalog no. 95303) and λ Fix phage (Stratagene, catalog no. 46309) were screened using a human MMP-9 cDNA probe (pHG1, Ref.21Huhtala P.

Hybridization was performed in 5× SSC, 5× Denhardt's solution, and 0.1% SDS overnight at 42 °C, after which the filters were washed at a final concentration of 0.1× SSC and 0.1% SDS at 42 °C. The clones were isolated and purified utilizing standard procedures and mapped using restriction endonucleases. The nucleotide sequence was determined by the dideoxynucleotide chain termination procedure (36Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52505) Google Scholar) using Sequenase or TAQuence DNA sequencing kits (U.S. Biochemical Corp.) and M13 universal primers or specific oligonucleotide primers. Both strands of the gene and its promoter were sequenced following subcloning into pBluescript II SK+/− (Stratagene). Total RNA from 7-day-old mouse skull was isolated by the acid guanidium thiocyanate/phenol chloroform extraction method (37Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63088) Google Scholar). Primer extension was performed by hybridizing 20 μg of total RNA with an antisense nucleotide primer annealing at positions 117–144 in the cDNA (Ref. 30Reponen P. Sahlberg C. Munaut C. Thesleff I. Tryggvason K. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 1091-1102Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar, Fig. 1). The primer was end-labeled by [γ-32P]ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase (38.Ausubel, F.

The reverse transcription reaction was carried out under standard conditions, and the primer-extended products were run on a sequencing gel along with sequencing reactions from the mouse MMP-9 gene using the same oligonucleotide as in the primer extension assay. Promoter-LacZ reporter gene constructs were created using the pKK2480 vector (kindly provided by Mikkel Rohde, University of Copenhagen, Denmark), which contains a multiple cloning site immediately upstream of the LacZ gene. Different length segments of the 5′-flanking region as well as the 5′-end of the MMP-9 gene containing the first exon and intron were excised with appropriate restriction enzymes and used for the construction of MMP-9/LacZ fusion genes. Transgenic animals harboring promoter-reporter gene constructs were generated by injection of the linearized LacZ fusion constructs into pronuclei of fertilized mouse oocytes C57BL/6 × DBA/2 F1 (39Hogan B.

At 3 weeks of age, tail DNA was isolated (40Drews R. Drohan W.N. Lubon H. BioTechniques. 1994; 17: 866-867PubMed Google Scholar), and transgenic animals were identified by polymerase chain reaction analysis using two internal primers of the LacZ gene (41Hanley T. Merlie J.P. BioTechniques. 1991; 10: 56PubMed Google Scholar). Mouse embryos from positive mice were recovered at different time points and fixed for 2 h or overnight at 4 °C in 2% paraformaldehyde, 0.2% glutaraldehyde in PBS. They were stained with 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-galactopyronoside (X-gal) as described by Behringer et al. (42Behringer R.R. Crotty D.A. Tennyson V.M. Brinster R.L. Palmiter R.D. Wolgemuth D.J. Development. 1993; 117: 823-833Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). X-gal-stained mouse embryos and other tissues were rinsed several times in PBS, dehydrated, and embedded in paraffin. Sections of 5–8 μm were stained either by hematoxylin and eosin (43Bancroft J.D. Stevens A. Bancroft J.D. Stevens A. Theory and Practice of Histological Techniques. Third Ed. Churchill Livingstone, Edinburgh, UK1990Google Scholar) or with safranin. Sections were stained for 2–5 min in 0.2% safranin, 1% acetic acid, differentiated for 1–5 s in 95% ethanol, 2–5 s in absolute ethanol, and mounted from xylene. Immunohistochemical staining of paraffin sections (5–10 μm) from skin wounds was carried out by using either the ABComplex horseradish peroxidase kit (DAKO) or the TSA kit (NEN Life Science Products). Deparaffinized sections were treated 5 min. with 0.4% pepsin in 0.01m HCl at 37 °C. Endogenous peroxidase activity was quenched by incubation for 20 min in 3% H2O2, and sections were then incubated with the antiserum raised against cytokeratin (rabbit anti-cytokeratin (Pan), Zymed Laboratories Inc.) for 1.5 h at room temperature. or MMP-9 (rabbit polyclonal antibody kindly provided by P. Carmeliet) overnight at room temperature. For the anti-cytokeratin immunostaining, the sections were washed in PBS, and subsequently, biotinylated Swine anti-rabbit IgG (Boehringer Mannheim) (1:400 dilution) was applied for 30 min at room temperature. After phosphate-buffered saline washes, a 20-min incubation with ABComplex/horseradish peroxidase was carried out (DAKO Code K355). Peroxidase activity was revealed by incubation with the chromogen substrate 3,3-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride. Sections were counterstained with hematoxylin and eosin. For the MMP-9 immunostaining, peroxidase swine anti-rabbit IgG (DAKO) was applied and followed by tyramide signal amplification (TSA kit; NEN Life Science Products). AEC chromogen substrate (DAKO) was used to detect peroxidase activity. Sections were counterstained with hematoxylin. A mouse MMP-9 cDNA fragment of 324 bp containing SmaI and EcoRI restriction sites from the M92KD-2 cDNA clone (bases 1915–2239) (30Reponen P. Sahlberg C. Munaut C. Thesleff I. Tryggvason K. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 1091-1102Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar) was subcloned into pSP64 ans pSP65 plasmid vectors (Promega). The pSP64 (sense) and pSP65 (antisense) plasmids vectors were linearized withEcoRI and BamHI restriction enzymes, respectively, and the 35S-uridine 5′-triphosphate (1000 mCi/nmol, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) labeled RNA probes were transcribed using a transcription kit (Promega). The labeled probes were precipitated with ethanol, dissolved in hybridization buffer, and used at 50,000–60,000 cpm/μl. The in situ hybridization was carried out according to Wilkinson and Green (44Wilkinson D.G. Green J. Copp A.J. Cockroft D.L. Postimplantation Mammalian Embryos. Oxford University Press, Oxford1990: 155-171Google Scholar). Prior to hybridization the mouse embryos were stained with X-gal, embedded in paraffin, and sectioned. The specimens were pretreated as described before (45Iivanainen A. Kortesmaa J. Sahlberg C. Morita T. Bergmann U. Thesleff I. Tryggvason K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27862-27868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) and hybridized with the probe at 5O °C for 16 h. After washing under high stringency conditions, the sections were dried and dipped in an autoradiographic emulsion (nitro blue tetrazolium-2; Eastman Kodak Co.), exposed for 14 days at 4 °C. After development of the sections, they were stained with hematoxylin and mounted. Screening of the genomic libraries yielded several clones, one of which (cosmid MGC-1 (about 34 kilobases)), contained the entire 7.7-kilobase gene (Fig.1), as well as 3 and 23 kilobases of the 5′- and 3′-end flanking regions, respectively. Another λ phage clone CM-1 contained about 11,000 bp of the 5′-flanking region. Sequencing of exons revealed that the murine gene contains 13 exons, which correspond in size to those of the human gene (Fig. 1, TableI). The only significant differences are exons 9 and 13 which, respectively, contain 54 and 15 base pairs more than in the human gene. Furthermore, introns 1, 2, 3, and 12 in the mouse gene are about half the size of corresponding human introns (21Huhtala P. Tuuttila A. Chow L. Lohi J. Keski-Oja J. Tryggvason K. J. Biol.

Asterisks indicate translation stop codon. The initiation site for transcription as determined by primer extension revealed a double start site located 19 and 20 bp upstream of the translated sequence (Fig. 2). Sequencing of about 2800 base pairs of the 5′-flanking region revealed several common promoter elements (Fig. 1). There is a TATA box-like motif TTAAA at positions −30 to −25 but no CCAAT box. There are three GC boxes that may serve as binding sites for the transcription factor Sp1 (46Lee W. Mitchell P. Tjian R. Cell. 1987; 49: 741-752Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1362) Google Scholar) (located at positions −62 to −57, −451 to −446, and −598 to −589). Four AP-1-like binding sites were also identified (−50 to −44, −88 to −80, −472 to −465, and −1080 to −1072). Two of those correspond to similar sequences in the human gene, but sites corresponding to the first one (−50 to −44) and the most upstream one have not been reported in the human gene. Several conserved sequence elements with similarity to the polyoma virus enhancer A-binding protein-3 sites (47Gutman A. Wasylyk B. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2241-2246Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar) were found in the 5′-flanking sequence (−365 to −360, −479 to −474, −658 to −653, and −901 to −896), as well as in the first intron (Fig. 1). One consensus sequence (5′-CCCCAGGC-3′) for AP-2 (−590 to −483), several microsatellite segments of alternating CA residues, as well as one NF-κB motif (−527 to −519) were also present. A putative tumor growth factor-β1-inhibitory element found in the human gene was absent in the murine promoter. During the course of this work, characterizations of the MMP-9 gene from mouse (48Masure S. Nys G. Fiten P. Van Damme J. Opdenakker G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 218: 129-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) and rabbit (49Fini E. Bartlett J. Matsubara M. Rinehart W. Mody M. Girard M. Rainville M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28620-28628Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were published. In order to explore the regulatory mechanisms of the MMP-9 gene, we generated transgenic mice by microinjection of different promoter-reporter gene constructs into fertilized oocytes. A total of six constructs containing different portions of the 5′-end of the gene and the β-galactosidase gene as a reporter were made (Fig. 3). Three constructs, 645-LacZ, 2700-LacZ, and 7700-LacZ, contained 0.65, 2.7, and 7.7 kb of the 5′-flanking region, and three constructs, 645ExIn-LacZ, 2700ExIn-LacZ, and 7700ExIn-LacZ, contained additionally the first exon and intron of the MMP-9 gene in front of the LacZ gene. The constructs containing exon 1 had a mutation in the ATG initiator codon for translation (ATG → ATC) to allow translation of the transcript to start from the ATG methionine initiator codon in the LacZ gene. Intron 1 was included in some of the construct, since it has been shown to contain enhancer elements in other genes such as that for the α1 chain of type I collagen (50Rossi P. Crombrugghe B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 5590-5594Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Three to eight lines of mice were generated with each construct to ensure that the expression pattern obtained with each construct was repeatable. Polymerase chain reaction and Southern analyses were carried out to establish integration of the inserts into the genome, and histochemical analyses with X-gal provided evidence about cell-specific expression patterns of the transgene. Transgenic mice were first generated with constructs containing the minimum promoter, 645-LacZ, and a longer one, 2700-LacZ, containing 2.7 kb of the upstream region. However, mice and mouse embryos made with these constructs did not yield any expression of the LacZ gene in cells that normally express MMP-9 in transgenic embryos or adult tissues. Ectopic expression could be observed in some lines with both constructs, but its pattern was neither uniform nor repeatable in four founder lines analyzed (data not shown). The addition of the 5′-end of the MMP-9 gene, including intron 1, to constructs 645-LacZ and 2700-LacZ (i.e. the 5′-untranslated region and the first exon and intron) did not alter the expression pattern. Consequently, it could be concluded that the first intron does not contain cis-acting elements conferring tissue-specific expression of the endogenous MMP-9 gene. Due to the lack of expression with the constructs described above, we made another one, 7700-LacZ, containing 7.7 kb of the upstream sequence and generated transgenic mice. In contrast, to the shorter constructs, mouse embryos harboring 7700-LacZrevealed expression of the LacZ gene in bones of 14.5–16.5-day-old embryos. For example, at embryonic day 15.5, distinct expression could be observed in the scapula, long bones of fore and hind limbs, ribs, and the lower jaw (Fig.4). Additionally, expression was observed in hair follicles in different mouse lines made with this construct. Construct 7700ExIn-LacZ, containing additionally the first exon and intron, yielded similar expression pattern in bones as 7700-LacZ when analyzed in whole X-gal-stained embryos, with the exception that no expression was present in hair follicles (Fig.4). Only mice made transgenic with constructs containing 7.7 kb of the 5′-flanking region of the MMP-9 gene yielded expression of the LacZ gene in bones as shown in whole embry"

The γ-carboxyglutamic acid domain substitution therefore lowered and/or reoriented the active site, repositioning it close to the 84 Å observed for the APC·protein S complex. Protein S enhances wild-type APC cleavage of factor Va at Arg306, but the inactivation rate of factor Va Leiden by the chimera alone is essentially equal to that by wild-type APC plus protein S. These data suggest that the activities of the chimera and of the APC·protein S complex are equivalent because the active site of the chimeric protein is already positioned near the optimal location above the membrane surface to cleave Arg306. Thus, one mechanism by which protein S regulates APC activity is by relocating its active site to the proper position above the membrane surface to optimize factor Va cleavage.

APC is a vitamin K-dependent anticoagulant enzyme that has extensive structural homology to other vitamin K-dependent enzymes (for reviews see Refs. 1Esmon C.T. J. Biol.

The N-terminal module (amino acids 1–38) of human APC contains 9 γ-carboxyglutamic acid (Gla) residues and is termed the Gla domain. The Gla domain is followed by a domain rich in aromatic residues (also known as the aromatic stack), by two domains that are homologous to the epidermal growth factor, and then by a serine protease domain that contains the active site. As is true for other vitamin K-dependent plasma proteins, APC binds via the Gla domain to membranes containing negatively charged phospholipids in the presence of calcium ions (1Esmon C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4743-4746Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Walker F.J. Fay P.J. FASEB J. 1992; 6: 2561-2567Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 3Esmon C.T. Hoffman R.

Light scattering experiments indicated that two elongated vitamin K-dependent proteins, prothrombin (PT) and factor X, project radially from the surface when bound to the membrane (11Lim T.K. Bloomfield V.A. Nelsestuen G.L. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 4177-4181Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), and our fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) experiments showed that the active site of each of the vitamin K-dependent enzymes is located far (>70 Å) above the membrane surface (12Yegneswaran S.

In the case of membrane-bound APC, its active site is located an average of 94 Å above the surface (assuming κ2 = 2/3; Ref. 12Yegneswaran S. Wood G.M. Esmon C.T. Johnson A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25013-25021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Our FRET study also revealed that protein S relocates the active site of membrane-bound APC to a unique position above the membrane surface (84 Å, assuming κ2 = 2/3). These FRET results therefore provide a possible structural explanation for the protein S-dependent alteration in the APC cleavage site on factor Va from Arg506 to Arg306. Because of the sequence similarity of the Gla domains in different vitamin K-dependent proteins, it has been assumed that the Gla domains of all vitamin K-dependent enzymes must be structurally and functionally similar (17Soriano-Garcia M. Padmanaban K. deVos A.M. Tulinsky A. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 2554-2566Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Consistent with this view, exchanging the Gla domain of factor VIIa for that of APC had no affect on APC plasma anticoagulant activity (18Geng J.-P. Castellino F.J. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1997; 77: 926-933Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). On the other hand, replacing the Gla domain of factor IXa with that of factor VIIa decreased theV max for factor X activation (19Ahmad S.S. Rawala-Sheikh R. Cheung W.-F. Jameson B.A. Stafford D.W. Walsh P.N. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 12048-12055Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the membrane binding affinities of vitamin K-dependent plasma proteins differ (e.g. Ref. 10Nelsestuen G.L. Kisiel W. Di Scipio R.G. Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 2134-2138Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). In addition, unique protein-protein interactions sometimes involve the Gla domain. For example, factor IXa, factor VIIa, and protein C have been shown to bind specifically to collagen IV (20Cheung W. van der Born J. Kühn K. Kjellen L. Hudson B.G. Stafford D.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 11068-11073Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), tissue factor (21Banner D.W. D'Arcy A. Chene C. Winkler F.K. Guha A. Konigsberg W.H. Nemerson Y. Kirchhofer D.

Recently, Smirnov et al. replaced the Gla domain and the aromatic stack of APC with the corresponding domains of prothrombin to form the APC-PTGla chimera (23Smirnov M.D. Safa O. Regan L. Mather T.

Exchange of the Gla domains did not alter the affinity for phosphatidylcholine/phosphatidylserine vesicles significantly but did increase the rate of factor Va inactivation on these vesicles. Furthermore, the activity of the chimera was not increased by protein S. In this study, we test the hypothesis that the location of the active site in the chimera may be similar to that in the APC·protein S complex and thereby explain the increased activity and protein S-independence exhibited by the chimera. Succinimidyl acetylthioacetate, octadecylrhodamine (OR), and 5-(iodoacetamido)fluorescein were obtained from Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR. Dioleoylphosphatidylcholine (PC) and dioleoylphosphatidylserine (PS) were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids, Alabaster, AL.l-3-Phosphatidylcholine-1,2-di[1-14C]oleoyl ([14C]PC) was obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech.d-Phenylalanyl-l-prolyl-l-arginyl (FPR) chloromethylketone was purchased from Calbiochem.

Human protein C-PTGla (3 mg) was activated in buffer A (50 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl) plus 5 mm EDTA by incubation with 150 μg of human thrombin at 37 °C in 10.5 ml of final volume. Complete activation of protein C-PTGla was determined by measuring chromogenic activity as a function of time until the activity plateaued (24Esmon C.T. Esmon N.L. Le Bonniec B.F. Johnson A.E. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 222: 359-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The chromogenic activity of the chimera has previously been shown to be equivalent to native APC (23Smirnov M.D. Safa O. Regan L. Mather T. Stearns-Kurosawa D.J. Kurosawa S. Rezaie A.R. Esmon N.L.

Fl-FPR-labeled APC-PTGla and human APC were then generated essentially as described for bovine APC (12Yegneswaran S. Wood G.M. Esmon C.T. Johnson A.E. J. Biol.

Factor V Leiden was purified from a patient homozygous for this dimorphism by a minor modification of the published procedure (23Smirnov M.D. Safa O. Regan L. Mather T. Stearns-Kurosawa D.J.

Factor Va inactivation with APC or the APC-PTGla chimera was studied as a function of enzyme concentration as described (23Smirnov M.D. Safa O. Regan L. Mather T. Stearns-Kurosawa D.J. Kurosawa S.

Factor Va activity was monitored with purified factor Xa, prothrombin, and PC/PS vesicles. Residual factor Va activity was then determined by reference to a standard curve of prothrombin activation rate versusfactor Va concentration (23Smirnov M.D. Safa O. Regan L. Mather T.

PC/PS (the molar ratio of PC to PS was 4:1) and 100% PC vesicles were prepared by sonication and centrifugation as described previously (13Husten E.J. Esmon C.T. Johnson A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 12953-12961Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Samples containing OR were prepared in the same way except that the desired amount of OR (in ethyl acetate) was added to the phospholipid before lyophilization and sonication (13Husten E.J. Esmon C.T. Johnson A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 12953-12961Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The concentrations of phospholipid and OR in a purified vesicle sample were determined as before (12Yegneswaran S. Wood G.M. Esmon C.T. Johnson A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25013-25021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), as was ς, the OR acceptor density at the vesicle surface. Fl-FPR-APC-PTGla binding to vesicles was evaluated by incubating 15 nm Fl-FPR-APC-PTGla with 600 μm PC/PS containing a trace amount ofl-3-phosphatidylcholine-1,2-di[1-14C]oleoyl in buffer A plus 2 mm CaCl2 for 15 min at room temperature and then analyzing the sample by gel filtration over a Superdex 200 FPLC column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The phospholipid vesicles and any bound Fl-FPR-APC-PTGla eluted in the void volume, whereas unbound protein eluted later. The phospholipid concentration was quantified by liquid scintillation counting, whereas Fl-FPR-APC-PTGla elution was detected by measuring fluorescein emission intensity. The calcium dependence of Fl-FPR-APC-PTGla binding to vesicles was examined by performing a parallel incubation and gel filtration in buffer A plus 5 mm EDTA. All spectral measurements, including determinations of Q, J DA, andR 0 were performed as before (12Yegneswaran S. Wood G.M. Esmon C.T. Johnson A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25013-25021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). FRET experiments were performed as before (12Yegneswaran S. Wood G.M. Esmon C.T. Johnson A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25013-25021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), except that the D (donor-containing) and DA (containing donor and acceptor) microcells initially received 15 nmFl-FPR-APC-PTGla (the donor), whereas microcells B (blank) and A (acceptor-containing) received 15 nm unmodified APC-PTGla. The initial net emission intensity (F o) was obtained by the subtraction of the signal of B from the signals of DA, A, and D. Samples D and B were then titrated with phospholipid vesicles lacking the OR acceptor, whereas samples DA and A were titrated with an equivalent amount of phospholipid vesicles containing OR. The emission intensity of a sample was measured 5 min after each addition of phospholipid, a time that was found to be sufficient to reach equilibrium (i.e. a stable signal). The net intensity of D, DA, or A (F D, F DA, andF A, respectively) was obtained by subtracting the signal of the background B and then correcting for dilution. The blank signal never exceeded 0.5% of the fluorescent signal of the D or DA samples. To compensate for any signal in the DA sample caused by direct excitation of the acceptor, the net dilution-corrected emission intensity of the A sample was subtracted from that of the DA sample. The intensity of DA was then normalized by comparison with its own initial intensity as shown below, as was that of D. Making the reasonable assumption that the absorbance of the donor dye in the active site is not altered by the presence of the OR at the membrane surface, the ratio of the donor quantum yields in the D and DA samples is given by QD/QDA=[FD/(FD)o]/[(FDA−FA)/(FDA−FA)o]Equation 1 where F is the net dilution-corrected emission intensity of a sample at some point in the titration, and the subscripto is used to denote the initial intensity of the sample. At the end of the phospholipid titration, the membrane-bound Fl-FPR-APC-PTGla was released from the membrane surface by the addition of 5 mm EDTA. After donor release from the membrane, the spectral measurements were repeated to determine what fraction of the acceptor-dependent reduction in donor emission intensity was due to Fl-FPR-APC-PTGla binding to the membrane. TheQ D/Q DA value used in Equation 2 below was calculated by dividing theQ D/Q DA value before EDTA addition by the Q D/Q DAvalue after EDTA addition. This normalization procedure corrects for the contribution of OR inner filter effects and membrane-binding independent energy transfer to the observed total reduction in donor emission intensity. For experiments with protein S, 15 nm Fl-FPR-APC-PTGla was first titrated with PC/PS(OR) vesicles until the FRET efficiency reached a constant value. Protein S was then titrated into membrane-bound Fl-FPR-APC-PTGla up to a final concentration of 300 nm. Identical procedures were used while performing control experiments with human Fl-FPR-APC, except that excess DTT instead of EDTA was used to release the fluorescein-labeled heavy chain of Fl-FPR-APC from the membrane surface (12Yegneswaran S. Wood G.M. Esmon C.T. Johnson A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25013-25021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). When the extent of energy transfer between randomly and uniformly distributed donor dyes in one infinite plane and randomly and uniformly distributed acceptor dyes in a parallel infinite plane is small, the first term in the approximate series solution of Dewey and Hammes (31Dewey T.G. Hammes G.G. Biophys. J. 1980; 32: 1023-1036Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) can be used to solve forL, the distance of closest approach between the donor and acceptor dyes in Å, QD/QDA=1+(πςRo2/2)(Ro/L)4Equation 2 where ς is the density of acceptor chromophores at the membrane surface (in OR/Å2), and R o is the distance between donor and acceptor dyes at which FRET efficiency is 50% (in Å). This approach is justified here becauseL > 1.5 R o (32Holowka D. Baird B. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 3466-3474Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The extent of FRET to the acceptor dyes at the inner surface of the 50-Å-thick phospholipid bilayer is negligible and has not been included in our calculations. Human Fl-FPR-APC-PTGla was prepared as described under “Experimental Procedures.” When the fluorescein concentration was determined as described by Bock (33Bock P.E. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 6633-6639Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), the number of dyes per protein averaged 0.7 in our preparations of both Fl-FPR-APC-PTGla and wild-type human Fl-FPR-APC, the same yield that we obtained previously with bovine Fl-FPR-APC (12Yegneswaran S. Wood G.M. Esmon C.T. Johnson A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25013-25021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). For the experiments described in this paper, the presence of nonfluorescein-labeled APC-PTGla or APC molecules in the sample does not interfere with our interpretation of the spectroscopic data. The corrected wavelength of maximum emission and the average values of quantum yield and of steady-state anisotropy were 520 nm, 0.30, and 0.20 for human Fl-FPR-APC and Fl-FPR-APC-PTGla, the same as previously published for bovine Fl-FPR-APC (12Yegneswaran S. Wood G.M. Esmon C.T. Johnson A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25013-25021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Thus, there is no significant difference in probe environment in the active sites of human and bovine APC. Furthermore, replacing the Gla domain of APC with the Gla domain of PT did not alter the spectral properties of the fluorescein dye and, hence, did not detectably alter the conformation of the active site of APC. When PC/PS vesicles were added to either human Fl-FPR-APC or Fl-FPR-APC-PTGla, no significant changes in fluorescein spectral properties were detected. In addition, the fluorescence lifetime of the fluorescein (3.9 ns) was unaltered when Fl-FPR-APC-PTGla bound to PC/PS, so the quantum yield of the fluorescein was unaffected by membrane binding. Thus, the binding of the protein to a membrane surface did not elicit a detectable alteration in the environment of the fluorescein dye in the active site of human APC. In our FRET experiments, the fluorescein dye in the active site of the protein is the FRET donor, whereas the rhodamine in OR is the FRET acceptor. The rhodamine dye is positively charged at pH 7.5 and remains in the aqueous phase, whereas the hydrophobic octadecyl aliphatic chain partitions into the lipid bilayer, thereby anchoring the rhodamine moiety at the aqueous-lipid interface. When human Fl-FPR-APC-PTGla was titrated with PC/PS vesicles, only a very small decrease in fluorescein emission intensity was detected (see Fig. 1, –OR). However, when Fl-FPR-APC-PTGla was titrated with PC/PS vesicles containing OR, the fluorescein intensity decreased until the phospholipid added was sufficient to bind all of the Fl-FPR-APC-PTGla (Fig. 1,+OR). The association of all of the Fl-FPR-APC-PTGla molecules with vesicles was confirmed by gel filtration (see below). This OR-dependent decrease in fluorescein intensity results largely from FRET from the fluorescein dyes in the active site of the protein to the rhodamine dyes localized at the phospholipid membrane surface. To facilitate analysis, the data in Fig. 1 were normalized and expressed in Fig. 2 as the ratio of donor quantum yields in the presence and absence of acceptor using Equation1. The OR-dependent decrease in fluorescein intensity evident in Figs. 1 and 2 shows that the fluorescein dyes are close enough to the rhodamine dyes for FRET to occur.Figure 2Gla domain and lipid dependence of Fl-FPR-APC-PTGla FRET to OR. The data of Fig. 1 are replotted here as Q DA/Q D (●). At the end of the titration, the membrane-bound Fl-FPR-APC-PTGla was released from the membrane by the addition of EDTA to a final concentration of 5 mm (○). In a parallel experiment, Fl-FPR-APC was titrated with PC/PS vesicles in the presence or absence of OR dyes (▴). The membrane-bound Fl-FPR-APC was released from the membrane by the addition of DTT to a final concentration of 200 mm (Δ). In another experiment, Fl-FPR-APC-PTGla (initially 15 nm) was titrated with 100% PC vesicles (■). The ς was 2.90 × 10−4 OR/Å2 in the PC experiment and 4.73 × 10−4 OR/Å2 in the others.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) For comparison, wild-type human Fl-FPR-APC was titrated in parallel with the same stock of PC/PS vesicles used for the Fl-FPR-APC-PTGla titrations. When Fl-FPR-APC was titrated with PC/PS vesicles, no significant change in fluorescein emission intensity was observed. However, when titrated with PC/PS vesicles containing OR (PC/PS(OR)), the Fl-FPR-APC emission decreased because of FRET, as shown by the reduction in Q DA/Q D (Fig.2). As a control, Fl-FPR-APC-PTGla was also titrated with 100% PC vesicles with or without OR because the PT Gla domain requires negatively charged phospholipids to bind to a membrane surface (34Nelsestuen G.L. Broderius M. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 4172-4177Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). As expected, no FRET was observed (Fig. 2). The small reduction inQ DA/Q D observed with PC vesicles (Fig. 2) results from an inner filter effect (a reduction in detected fluorescein emission caused by the absorption of excitation and emission light by rhodamine), not from FRET, as we have documented elsewhere (12Yegneswaran S. Wood G.M. Esmon C.T. Johnson A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25013-25021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The data in Fig. 2 also show that theQ DA/Q D values for wild-type human Fl-FPR-APC titrations were always higher than those for Fl-FPR-APC-PTGla at each point in the titration. Because the proteins were titrated with the same PC/PS(OR) vesicles, the extent of FRET between the fluorescein dye in the active site of membrane-bound Fl-FPR-APC-PTGla and OR dyes on the membrane surface was greater than that between membrane-bound Fl-FPR-APC and OR. The increased efficiency of energy transfer in the chimeric APC-PTGla relative to wild-type APC shows that the probe in the active site of the membrane-bound chimera is not in the same position as that in membrane-bound APC. Thus, the active sites of membrane-bound wild-type APC and APC-PTGla are positioned at different locations above the membrane, with the active site of the chimera closer to the surface and/or rotated so that the relative orientation of the donor and acceptor transition dipoles is more parallel. At the low concentrations of fluorescent-labeled protein and OR used in our experiments, the average separation between free protein and OR molecules is too large for detectable FRET to occur. Thus, if PC/PS-bound Fl-FPR-APC-PTGla or Fl-FPR-APC is released from the membrane surface at the end of the experiment, no FRET should occur, and theQ DA/Q D value should return to 1.0. Because vitamin K-dependent proteins require calcium ions to bind to negatively charged phospholipid surfaces, an excess of EDTA is commonly used to chelate the calcium ions and dissociate the protein·membrane complex (e.g. Refs.13Husten E.J.

Fertilization triggers release of the metaphase arrest and induces onset of embryonic cell cycles (19Moses R.M. Masui Y. Exp. Cell Res. 1989; 185: 271-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Many of the components in the maturation induction pathway are still unknown. For example, it is unclear how Mos and Raf protein kinases are activated following progesterone stimulation; how activation of MAP kinase by Raf and Mos protein kinases leads to the activation of Cdc25 phosphatase; and how the phosphorylation orchestrated by multiple mitotic kinases induces meiotic divisions. Moreover, whereas tyrosine phosphorylation has been implicated in progesterone-inducedXenopus oocyte maturation (20Unger T.F. Steele R.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5485-5498Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 21Spivack J.G. Erikson R.L. Maller J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1984; 4: 1631-1634Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), neither the tyrosine kinases nor their substrates have been defined. Because most of these events involve protein phosphorylation, identification and characterization of novel proteins that become phosphorylated during progesterone-induced oocyte maturation may shed new light on this process. We describe the identification, purification, and molecular cloning of Xp95, a novel 95-kDa protein in Xenopus oocytes which undergoes phosphorylation from the first through the second meiotic divisions. The protein sequence of Xp95 suggests that it belongs to an emerging family of signal transduction proteins, is a substrate of tyrosine kinases, and may interact with SH3 domain-containing proteins. In support of the possibility that Xp95 is a substrate of tyrosine kinases, we showed that Xp95 and an Xp95 peptide were phosphorylatedin vitro by Src kinase and to a lesser extent by Fyn kinases. In addition, Xp95 from Xenopus oocytes and eggs was recognized by an anti-phosphotyrosine antibody, and the abundance of tyrosine-phosphorylated Xp95 increased during oocyte maturation. Furthermore, microinjection of deregulated Src message intoXenopus oocytes increased the abundance of tyrosine-phosphorylated Xp95. The features of Xp95 suggest that Xp95 functions in a signal transduction pathway involved in progesterone-induced oocyte maturation. Interphase-arrested Xenopus oocyte extract and M phase-arrested Xenopus egg extract were prepared as described previously (16Kuang J. Ashorn C.L. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 859-868Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) with the following modifications.Xenopus oocyte and egg extraction buffer (EB) was 80 mm β-glycerophosphate, 20 mm EGTA, and 15 mm MgCl2, pH 7.3, supplemented with 20 mm NaF, 1 mm ATP, 1 mm DTT, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.1 mg/ml each of leupeptin, pepstatin A, and chymostatin. Both extracts were immediately frozen at −70 °C. To thiophosphorylate proteins in egg extract, the extract was precipitated with 40% ammonium sulfate, desalted by gel filtration through 10DG columns (Bio-Rad) into EB supplemented with 1 mm DTT and 50 μm ATPγS, and incubated at room temperature for 3–4 h. To determine the timing of Xp95 gel mobility shift during progesterone-induced Xenopus oocyte maturation, surgically removed stage VI oocytes cultured in modified Barth's solution (22Gurdon J.B. J. Embryol. Exp. Morphol. 1976; 36: 523-540PubMed Google Scholar) were treated with 1 μm progesterone. At 1-h intervals, six oocytes were collected and immediately homogenized by pipetting with 60 μl of EB supplemented 1 mm DTT and 0.1 mg/ml each of leupeptin, pepstatin A, and chymostatin. The homogenate was then centrifuged at ∼14,000 × g for 30 min, and the layer between the surface lipid layer and bottom yolk pellet was collected and immediately frozen at −70 °C. To examine the Xp95 gel mobility shift after fertilization, egg laying was induced by injection of 800 units of human chorionic gonadotropin (Sigma) into the dorsal lymph sacs of adult female frogs. On the following day, sperm was prepared from testes surgically removed from adult male frogs and suspended in 0.1× modified Barth's solution (23Peng H.B. Methods Cell Biol. 1991; 36: 657-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Eggs were collected, fertilized with the sperm suspension, and then dejellied in 2% (w/v) l-cysteine dissolved in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.9. The fertilized eggs were washed extensively with 0.1× modified Barth's solution and maintained in the same solution at 20 °C. Six embryos were collected and extracted at 15-min intervals as described for extraction of oocytes and eggs. The anti-Cdc25 antibody was produced against a recombinant Xenopus Cdc25 fused at its N terminus to glutathione S-transferase (GST-Cdc25). GST-Cdc25 was produced in Escherichia coli TG-1 cells harboring the expression vector GEX-KG-Xenopus cdc25 and purified by the absorption of the cell lysates with glutathione-agarose. After separation by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), the GST-Cdc25 band was excised from the gel and used to immunize a rabbit. To affinity purify the anti-Cdc25 antibody, the antiserum was incubated at 4 °C overnight with GST-Cdc25 protein immobilized onto nitrocellulose membrane. After the membrane was washed six times with 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.05% Tween 20 (TBST), the bound antibody was eluted with MAPS II elution buffer (Bio-Rad), neutralized to pH 7.5, concentrated by centrifugation through Centricon-30, and stored at −20 °C. The anti-YNK1 antibody was produced and affinity purified as described previously (24Che S. Weil M.M. Etkin L.D. Epstein H.F. Kuang J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1354: 231-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The anti-Xenopus MAP kinase antibody was raised in rabbit against a Xenopus MAP kinase peptide (25Hsiao K.M. Chou S.Y. Shih S.J. Ferrel J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5480-5484Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine antibody PY99 was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Immunoblotting with anti-Cdc25 antibody, anti-YNK1 antibody, or anti-MAP kinase antibody was performed using alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Promega Corp., Madison, WI) as the second antibody and nitro blue tetrazolium chloride and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate for the color development (16Kuang J. Ashorn C.L. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 859-868Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Immunoblotting with PY99 was performed using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG as the second antibody and ECL Western blotting detection reagents for fluorescence development (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The histone H1 kinase assay was performed as described previously (16Kuang J. Ashorn C.L. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 859-868Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). 20 μl of egg extract was diluted 1:10 with EB and absorbed with 10 0.6-cm diameter discs of nylon membrane (maximum strength Nytran; Schleicher & Schuell) at 4 °C for 2 h with continuous rotation. After the membrane discs were washed three times with TBST and once with 50 mmsodium citrate, pH 5.5, they were incubated in the same citrate buffer supplemented with 2.0 units/ml potato acid phosphatase (Boehringer Mannheim) at 37 °C for 2 h. The membrane discs were then washed several times with TBST and eluted with a minimal volume of SDS-PAGE sample buffer. The eluted proteins were separated by 12.5% SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with the anti-Cdc25 antibody. All chromatography was performed at 4 °C in 0.25× EB (CB) unless otherwise noted. Ammonium sulfate precipitation was performed by incubating samples with ammonium sulfate (Bio-Rad) at 4 °C for 30 min followed by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. To purify Xp95 for amino acid sequencing, 20 ml of oocyte extract was precipitated with 40% ammonium sulfate and desalted into CB by gel filtration through 10DG columns (Bio-Rad). The desalted sample was loaded onto a 20-ml Q-Sepharose fast flow column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), which was subsequently washed with 60 ml of the same buffer. The pooled flow-through from the Q-Sepharose chromatography was then loaded onto a 7-ml Affi-Gel blue column (Bio-Rad), which was subsequently washed with 25 ml of CB and eluted with 25 ml of CB containing 0.4 mNaCl. Finally, the 0.4 m NaCl eluate from the Affi-Gel blue chromatography was precipitated with 40% ammonium sulfate, resuspended in 200 μl of CB, and then sedimented at 4 °C through a 3-ml 10–20% sucrose gradient in a SW50.1 rotor (Beckman, Irvine, CA) at 40,000 rpm for 13 h, from which 200-μl fractions were collected. To obtain partial amino acid sequences of Xp95, two different procedures were performed (26Cook R. Dunbar B.S. Protein Blotting: A Practical Approach. 1. IRL Press at Oxford University Press, Oxford1994: 207-220Google Scholar). In one procedure, proteins from partially purified Xp95 were separated by SDS-PAGE, transblotted onto Immobilon-P nylon membrane (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA), and visualized by staining with 0.1% Coomassie Blue R-250 in 1% acetic acid, 40% methanol followed by destaining with 50% methanol. The Xp95 band was then excised and digested with CNBr in situ. The digested peptides were then separated by Tricine/SDS-PAGE (27Schagger H. Jagow G.V. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10480) Google Scholar), transblotted onto an Immobilon-P membrane, and visualized by Coomassie Blue staining. The most prominent band was excised from the membrane and sequenced in situ with an automated amino acid sequencer (model 473A, Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). In the alternative procedure, the gel-separated proteins were directly stained with 0.5% Coomassie Blue in 10% acetic acid and 45% methanol followed by destaining with 7.5% acetic acid and 25% methanol. The Xp95 band was then removed from the gel and digested with Lys-C. The collected peptides were then separated by high performance liquid chromatography (SMART; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) on reverse-phase column μRPC C2-C18. Two of the purified peptides were then sequenced using the same automated amino acid sequencer. To clone a full-length cDNA encoding Xp95, a partial Xp95 cDNA clone was first obtained by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of poly(A)+ RNA isolated from stage VI Xenopusoocytes using degenerate primers. The forward primer, GA(C/T)GCNACNAT(A/C/T)TT(C/T)GCNAA, and the reverse primer, (C/T)TC(T/G/A)AT(A/G)TA(G/A)TC(G/A)TG), were designed based on the Xp95 amino acid sequences DATIPAN (P1, see Refs. 2Smith L.D.

Cell. 1992; 3: 927-939Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar), respectively. The PCR products were cloned into pBlueScript II (KS−) (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), and the clones encoding the Xp95 sequence were selected by DNA sequencing. The partial Xp95 cDNA sequence was then used to design primers that could amplify 5′- and 3′-ends of the full-length cDNA by rapid amplification of cDNA ends using the Marathon cDNA amplification kit (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA). The resulting products were cloned into the pCR2.1 TOPO vector with a TOPO TA cloning kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and verified by DNA sequencing. Both human SRC and bovine Fyn kinases were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). The human SRC kinase was a recombinant protein expressed in SF9 insect cells by baculovirus containing the human c-SRC gene and purified from the crude cell lysates by hydroxylapatite and affinity chromatography. The bovine cellular Fyn kinase was extracted from membrane fractions of bovine thymus and purified by sequential chromatography on DEAE-Sepharose, hydroxylapatite, and phenyl-Sepharose columns, followed by Sephacryl S-200 gel filtration. Both the Src and Fyn kinase samples were indicated to be free of other protein kinase contaminants. Phosphorylation of the standard substrate peptide KVEKIGEGTYGVVYK confirmed that both kinases were active and that they had comparable efficiencies. Xp95 was partially purified from Xenopus oocyte extract as described earlier. Two Xp95 peptides, AAKKDNDFIYHDRVPDLKDLDP (22-mer) and ELVANLKEGTKFYNDLTDIL (20-mer), were synthesized in the Synthetic Antigen Laboratory at The University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center using a DuPont 250 Peptide Coupler. To assay phosphorylation of Xp95 or Xp95 peptides by Src and Fyn kinases, ∼1 μg of Xp95 or Xp95 peptides was incubated with 20 units of Src or Fyn kinase in 30 μl of kinase reaction buffer containing 100 mm Tris, pH 7.2, 125 mm MgCl2, 25 mm MnCl2, 2 mm EGTA, 0.25 mm sodium orthovanadate, 2 mm DTT, 0.5 mm ATP, and 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP at room temperature for 30 min. The reaction was stopped by addition of SDS-PAGE sample buffer. To detect phosphorylation of Xp95, the reaction mixtures were separated by SDS-PAGE, immunoblotted with anti-YNK1 antibody, and subjected to autoradiography. To detect phosphorylation of Xp95 peptides, the reaction mixtures were separated by Tricine/SDS-PAGE at a constant current of 20 mA overnight. The gel was then stained with Coomassie Blue followed by autoradiography. Ovarian tissue was surgically removed from adult Xenopus laevis (Xenopus Express, Beverly Hills, FL) and anesthetized by 2.5 mg/ml 3-aminobenzoic acid ethyl ester (Sigma). Stage VI oocytes were manually defolliculated and maintained in modified Barth's solution. Myc-Xp95 fusion cDNA was constructed by inserting Xp95 cDNA in frame between theEcoRI and StuI sites in the CS2+MT vector (28Rupp R.A.W. Snider L. Weintrab H. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1311-1323Crossref PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar,29Turner D.L. Weintrab H. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1434-1447Crossref PubMed Scopus (953) Google Scholar). cDNA containing the coding region of deregulated version ofXenopus c-src gene has been previously described (20Unger T.F. Steele R.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5485-5498Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). RNAs for injection were produced by in vitrotranscription of the linearized plasmids using Ambion mMESSAGE mMACHINETM SP6 Large Scale In VitroTranscription kit for Capped RNAs (Austin, TX). After the transcripts were purified by LiCl precipitation, oocytes were each microinjected with 2–3 ng of RNA in 10–20 nl of H2O or an equivalent amount of H2O and were maintained overnight (∼12 h) in modified Barth's solution. For the experiments that involved partial purification of Xp95 from injected oocytes by chromatography, 300 oocytes were injected with each sample, and the injected oocytes were extracted in an Eppendorf tube with 2 volumes of EB supplemented with 20 mm NaF, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm DTT, and 0.1 mg/ml protease inhibitors. The extracts were then precipitated with 40% ammonium sulfate and desalted into 0.25× EB by gel filtration through a 3-ml G-25 column. The desalted samples were absorbed with 200 μl of HiTrap Q-Sepharose resin in an Eppendorf tube at 4 °C for 10 min, and supernatant was collected after pelleting the resin by centrifugation. The supernatants were then absorbed with 300 μl of Affi-Gel blue resin at 4 °C for 20 min, and the resin was recovered. The Affi-Gel blue resins were then washed four times with 0.25× EB and eluted with 300 μl of SDS-PAGE sample buffer at 90 °C for 5 min. For the experiments that involved isolation of Myc epitope tagged Xp95 from injected oocytes, 60 oocytes were injected with each sample, and the injected oocytes were extracted in an Eppendorf tube with 4 volumes of EB supplemented with 20 mm NaF, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm DTT, and 0.1 mg/ml protease inhibitors. The extracts were then absorbed with 1 μg of anti-Myc polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) immobilized onto 10 μl of Affi-Prep protein A beads (Bio-Rad) at 4 °C for 3 h. After the protein A beads were pelleted down by centrifugation and washed five times with EB including 0.5 m NaCl and 0.5% Nonidet P-40, the immobilized proteins were eluted by SDS-PAGE sample buffer. In the process of studying the mechanism that initiates Cdc25 phosphorylation during Xenopus oocyte maturation, we generated a polyclonal antibody against recombinantXenopus Cdc25. The affinity purified anti-Cdc25 antibody recognized not only the 76-kDa Cdc25 but also a more prominent polypeptide of ∼95 kDa designated Xp95 (Fig.1 A). Studies were initiated to investigate the molecular identity and possible functions of Xp95 due to the following observations. Xp95 in interphase-arrested oocyte extract migrated as a single band in SDS-PAGE; however, in M phase-arrested egg extract it became a doublet, as shown in Fig. 1 B. Since the appearance of a slower migrating species of Xp95 in egg extract is reminiscent of many proteins that become phosphorylated during progesterone-induced oocyte maturation, like c-Mos (5Sagata N. Daar I. Oskarsson M. Showalter S.D. Vande Woude G.F. Science. 1989; 245: 643-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar), c-Raf (7Muslin A.J. MacNicol A.M. Williams L.T. Mol. Cell.

Gonzalez-Kuyvenhoven M. Penkala J.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 135-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), the following experiments were carried out to determine whether the gel mobility shift of Xp95 was due to protein phosphorylation. First, we examined whether dephosphorylation could eliminate the slower migrating form of Xp95 in egg extract. Egg extract was immobilized onto nylon membrane discs and then incubated with either potato acid phosphatase or control buffer. Immobilization of egg extract presumably disabled endogenous kinases that might rephosphorylate Xp95. Immunoblotting of the proteins eluted from the membrane with anti-Cdc25 antibody showed that the phosphatase treatment eliminated the slower migrating species while increasing the intensity of the faster migrating species of Xp95 (Fig. 1 C). Second, we tested whether thiophosphorylation of Xp95 with the ATP analog ATPγS, which generates thiophosphorylated proteins resistant to phosphatase activity (33Gratecos D. Fisher E.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1974; 58: 960-967Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar), increased the relative abundance of the slower migrating species of Xp95. For this, egg extract was precipitated with 40% ammonium sulfate, desalted into a buffer that included ATPγS but not ATP, and then incubated at room temperature for phosphatase turnover. As shown in Fig. 1 D, this treatment increased the intensity of the slower migrating species of Xp95 and decreased the intensity of the faster migrating species. Collectively, these results indicate that Xp95 undergoes a phosphorylationdependent gel mobility shift during progesterone-induced Xenopus oocyte maturation. Progesterone-inducedXenopus oocyte maturation mainly consists of progesterone-induced signal transduction and meiotic divisions. To ascertain which process the Xp95 phosphorylation is more likely to be associated with, the timing of Xp95 gel mobility shift during progesterone-induced oocyte maturation was determined.Xenopus oocytes were incubated in the presence of 1 μm progesterone for 8 h and extracted at 1-h intervals. The protein extracts were then immunoblotted with anti-Cdc25 antibodies to reveal the Xp95 gel mobility shift, with anti-MAP kinase antibodies to reveal the activation status of MAP kinase, and assayed for histone H1 kinase activity to reveal the activation status of mitotic Cdc2 kinase. It has been established that MAP kinase activation, which is associated with a gel mobility shift of the protein (10Pasada J. Yew N. Ahn N.G. Vande Woude G.F. Cooper J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2546-2553Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar, 30Shibuya E.K. Boulton T.G. Cobb M.H. Ruderman J.V. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3963-3975Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), occurs from the first to the second meiotic divisions (8Ferrell J.E. Wu M. Gerhart J.C. Martin G.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 1965-1971Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar, 34Gotoh Y. Moriyama K. Matsuda S. Okumura E. Kishimoto T. Kawasaki H. Suzuki K. Yahara I. Sakai H. Nishida E. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 2661-2668Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar), whereas mitotic Cdc2 kinase, which accounts for ≥80% histone H1 kinase activity in Xenopus oocytes and eggs (35Kuang J. Penkala J.E. Wright D.A. Saunders G.F. Rao P.N. Dev. Biol. 1991; 144: 54-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), is transiently activated at the first meiotic division, inactivated in the interphase between the first and second meiotic divisions, and activated again at the second meiotic division. As shown in Fig.2 A, the Xp95 doublet appeared at approximately the same time as MAP kinase activation and remained for the rest of the maturation process. This was in contrast to Cdc2 kinase activity, which rose, fell, and rose again during this period. The gel mobility shift of Xp95 from the first to the second meiotic divisions suggests that the Xp95 phosphorylation is associated with progesterone-induced signal transduction but not with M phase induction. The metaphase arrest of mature Xenopus oocytes or unfertilized eggs can be released by fertilization, which triggers dephosphorylation of many proteins phosphorylated during oocyte maturation. To determine the phosphorylation status of Xp95 after fertilization, Xenopus eggs were fertilized in vitro, and the eggs were extracted at 15-min intervals to examine Xp95 gel mobility, MAP kinase activation status, and mitotic Cdc2 kinase activity. It has been established that MAP kinase becomes inactivated after fertilization and that most, if not all, MAP kinase remains inactivated until midblastula transition (8Ferrell J.E. Wu M.

The ternary complexes regulate IGF availability to the tissues. Since interactions of glycoproteins can be influenced by their glycan moieties, this study aimed to determine the role of ALS glycosylation in ternary complex formation. Complete deglycosylation abolished the ability of ALS to associate with IGFBP-3. To examine this further, seven recombinant ALS mutants each lacking one of the seven glycan attachment sites were expressed in CHO cells. All the mutants bound IGFBP-3, demonstrating that this interaction is not dependent on any single glycan chain. Enzymatic desialylation of ALS caused a shift in isoelectric point from 4.5 toward 7, demonstrating a substantial contribution of anionic charge by sialic acid. Ionic interactions are known to be involved in the association between ALS and IGFBP-3. Desialylation reduced the affinity of ALS for IGFBP-3·IGF complexes by 50–80%.

Clemmons D.R. Endocr. Rev. 1995; 16: 3-34Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). At least 75% of the total circulating IGFs are carried in 130–150-kDa ternary complexes containing IGF-binding protein-3 (IGFBP-3) (2Rajaram S. Baylink D.J. Mohan S. Endocr. Rev. 1997; 18: 801-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (963) Google Scholar) and an 85-kDa glycoprotein, the acid-labile subunit (ALS) (3Baxter R.C. Martin J.L. Beniac V.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 11843-11848Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, IGFBP-5 was also found to form a similar ternary complex with the IGFs and ALS in serum (4Twigg S.M. Baxter R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6074-6079Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). It is thought that the size of the ternary complex restricts the passage of IGFs to target cells, while free IGFs, or IGFs in binary complexes with IGFBPs, can cross the capillary endothelial barrier. Therefore, ALS regulates the hypoglycemic and mitogenic potential of the circulating IGFs via the formation of the ternary complexes. Furthermore, ALS plays a vital role in maintaining a circulating store of the IGFs, IGFBP-3, and possibly IGFBP-5, by significantly increasing their serum half-lives (5Guler H.P. Zapf J. Schmid C. Froesch E.R. Acta Endocrinol. 1989; 121: 753-758Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Lewitt M.S. Saunders H. Baxter R.C. Endocrinology. 1993; 133: 1797-1802Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar).Despite the importance of the ternary complexes in regulating serum IGF bioactivity, nothing is known about the structural aspects of ALS that enable it to interact with IGFBPs. There are two features of ALS structure that may play a part. First, the protein backbone of ALS is made up of repeating blocks each containing 24 amino acids, of which 6 are typically leucine residues. This places ALS in the leucine-rich repeat superfamily of proteins (7Leong S.R. Baxter R.C. Camerato T. Dai J. Wood W.I. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 870-876Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), all of which are involved in protein-protein interactions (8Kobe B. Deisenhofer J. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1995; 5: 409-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). Second, serum ALS is heavily and heterogeneously glycosylated with N-linked glycan chains (3Baxter R.C. Martin J.L. Beniac V.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 11843-11848Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and glycosylation is known to influence the interactions of many proteins.Electrophoretic studies have shown that human ALS circulates as two glycoforms. Serum-purified ALS displays a characteristic doublet on SDS-PAGE at 84–86 kDa, which is reduced to a single band of less than 70 kDa after enzymatic removal of the N-linked sugars (3Baxter R.C. Martin J.L. Beniac V.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 11843-11848Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). There are seven consensus N-linked sugar attachment sites within the amino acid sequence of ALS that are conserved between primate and rodent (7Leong S.R. Baxter R.C. Camerato T. Dai J. Wood W.I. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 870-876Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 9Dai J. Baxter R.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

A. 1996; 93: 10028-10033Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). One site occurs almost in the center of the sequence, and a cluster of three sites is found toward each terminus. Between six and seven bands are observed upon partial deglycosylation of ALS derived from serum, suggesting that multiple sites are used (12Liu F. Hintz R.L. Khare A. Diaugustine R.P. Powell D.R. Lee P.D. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1994; 79: 1883-1886Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Although there are no studies that directly identify physical features of ALS involved in ternary complex formation, there is evidence that charge-charge interaction exists between ALS and the IGF·IGFBP-3 binary complex. Polyanions, polycations, and increasing ionic strength all decrease the affinity of ALS for IGFBP-3 (13Holman S.R. Baxter R.C. Growth Regul. 1996; 6: 42-47PubMed Google Scholar, 14Baxter R.C. Biochem. J. 1990; 271: 773-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Recently we have shown that the removal of basic residues in the carboxyl-terminal region of IGFBP-3 decreased its affinity for ALS by 90%, indicating the importance of positive charge in this region (15Firth S.M. Ganeshprasad U. Baxter R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2631-2638Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). From these observations, it is likely that negative charges on ALS may be involved in the interaction. At physiological pH, ALS binds tightly to weak anion exchange columns, indicating that it has a net negative charge (3Baxter R.C. Martin J.L. Beniac V.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 11843-11848Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Since carbohydrates are a potential source of negative charge in glycoproteins, as well as being involved in protein interactions, we have investigated whether N-linked sugars on ALS play a role in the formation of ternary complexes between IGFs, IGFBP-3, and ALS.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESReagentsPreparations of natural human ALS, human IGFBP-3, and rabbit antiserum against IGFBP-3 were similar to those used in previous studies (3Baxter R.C. Martin J.L. Beniac V.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 11843-11848Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Baxter R.C. Bayne M.L. Cascieri M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 60-65Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). ALS was radioiodinated and purified by ion-exchange chromatography as described previously (17Baxter R.C. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1990; 70: 1347-1353Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). IGF-I (Genentech, San Francisco, CA) was iodinated and cross-linked to IGFBP-3 as in previous studies (18Baxter R.C. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1988; 67: 265-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Restriction enzymes and materials for site-directed mutagenesis were from Promega Corp. (Madison, WI). Bovine serum albumin (BSA; radioimmunoassay grade, fraction V), γ-globulin, hexadimethrine bromide (Polybrene), dexamethasone, hypoxanthine, xanthine, thymidine, and mycophenolic acid were purchased from Sigma. Aminopterin was obtained from Life Technologies Inc.. Nucleoside-free α-modified Eagle's medium (α-MEM) and fetal calf serum were from Cytosystems (New South Wales, Australia). Centricon 30 microconcentrators were obtained from Amicon (Beverly, MA). n-Octyl glucoside,O-glycosidase (endo-α-N-acetylgalactosaminidase), and peptide-N-glycosidase F (PNGase F; peptide-N 4-(acetyl-β-glucosaminyl)-asparagine amidase) were obtained from Boehringer Mannheim.N-Acetylneuraminidase III (NANase III) was from Glyko (Novato, CA). Endo-β-N-acetylglucosaminidase (Endo F containing <0.1% PNGase F; catalog no. 324706), 2,3-dehydro-2-deoxy-N-acetylneuraminic acid (DANA), and the sialic acid-specific lectin from Tritichomonas mobilensiswere purchased from Calbiochem (La Jolla, CA).Enzymatic Deglycosylation and Desialylation of ALSCharacterization of ALS GlycosylationPNGase F (5 units) and NANase III (25 milliunits) were used to remove N-linked sugars and sialic acids, respectively. Reactions contained [125I]ALS (4 × 105 cpm, ∼40 ng), 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 6.5), and 0.1% (w/v)n-octyl glucoside, and were incubated at 37 °C for 16 h. Identical reactions were set up without enzyme as controls. To investigate O-glycosylation, [125I]ALS (∼40 ng) was treated at 37 °C with 5 units of PNGase F with the addition of 12.5 milliunits of NANase III after 8 h, then 2 milliunits of O-glycosidase 3 h later. The mixture was subsequently incubated for an additional 12–16 h at 37 °C.Enzymatic Deglycosylation for IGFBP-3 Binding StudiesA series of increasingly deglycosylated [125I]ALS preparations was generated by incubation with 2.3, 11.7, 29.3, and 58.6 milliunits of Endo F/ng of [125I]ALS in 50 mmsodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.5, containing 0.0005% (w/v)n-octyl glucoside, for 16 h at 37 °C. For complete deglycosylation, [125I]ALS was treated with 640 milliunits of Endo F/ng of [125I]ALS in 0.0075% (w/v)n-octyl glucoside.Desialylated [125I]ALS was prepared using 0.035 milliunits of NANase III/ng of [125I]ALS in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 6.5) at 37 °C for 16 h. In experiments where DANA was used, it was added at 1 nmol/milliunit NANase III to specifically inhibit the sialidase activity of NANase III.Site-directed Mutagenesis of ALSThe ALS cDNA was generated by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction from normal human liver total RNA as described previously (10Delhanty P. Baxter R.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 227: 897-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). This cDNA was inserted into the BamHI/XbaI site of pSELECT (Promega Corp.) for mutagenesis according to the manufacturer's recommended protocol. Mutagenic deoxyoligonucleotides were used to generate seven different ALS cDNAs, each containing Asn to Ala codon substitutions at one of the seven consensusN-glycan linkage sites (Asn37 → Ala, 5′-CTGCAGCTCCAGGgcCCTCACGCGCCTG-3′; Asn58 → Ala, 5′-GCTGGACGGCAACgcCCTCTCGTCCGTC-3′; Asn69 → Ala, 5′-GGCAGCCTTCCAGgcCCTCTCCAGCCTG-3′; Asn341 → Ala, 5′-CGTGGCGGTCATGgcCCTCTCTGGGAAC-3′; Asn448 → Ala, 5′-CCTCAGCCTCAGGgcCAACTCACTGCGG-3′; Asn527 → Ala, 5′-CTTCGCCCTGCAGgcCCCCAGTGCTGTG-3′; Asn553 → Ala, 5′-CCCGCGTACACCTACAACgcCATCACCTG-3′; substituted nucleotides are shown in lowercase). Oligonucleotides were synthesized using an Oligo 1000 DNA Synthesizer (Beckman, Palo Alto, CA). The mutations were confirmed by sequencing (T7 sequencing kit; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and then the cDNAs were excised from pSELECT and inserted into the NheI/SalI site of pMSG (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), an expression vector that contains the constitutively active and glucocorticoid-inducible murine mammary tumor virus promoter.Cell Culture and TransfectionsChinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells were transfected with either wild-type or mutant ALS expression constructs, or pMSG alone using the Polybrene/Me2SO technique (19Chaney W.G. Howard D.R. Pollard J.W. Sallustio S. Stanley P. Somat. Cell Mol. Genet. 1986; 12: 237-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). pMSG contains the guanine phosphoribosyltransferase gene, which confers resistance to mycophenolic acid. Stable transfectants were selected for 3 weeks in α-MEM supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 25 μg/ml mycophenolic acid, 2 μg/ml aminopterin, 250 μg/ml xanthine, 15 μg/ml hypoxanthine, and 10 μg/ml thymidine. Some ALS transfectants were cultured from single foci to produce clonal lines. Flasks of stably transfected cells were grown to confluence in α-MEM supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, then the medium was changed to α-MEM supplemented with 10 μm dexamethasone. After 3–4 days, the conditioned medium was collected and cell debris was removed by centrifugation. Supernatants were then concentrated and equilibrated into 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 6.5) using Centricon 30 microconcentrators. Conditioned media from CHO cells transfected with pMSG alone were concentrated to the same extent as media containing the lowest concentration of mutant ALS, and used as controls.Electrophoretic AnalysesSDS-PAGE AnalysisRadioiodinated ALS (5,000 cpm, ∼0.5 ng) in Laemmli buffer was loaded, without heat treatment, onto 7.5% Ready gels (Bio-Rad) and electrophoretically separated under nonreducing conditions. The gels were then dried and exposed to Hyperfilm MP (Amersham, Bucks, UK) overnight at −80 °C.Isoelectric Focusing of ALSPreparations of [125I]ALS (10,000 cpm, ∼1 ng), untreated or treated with NANase III, were added to sample buffer containing 4% (w/v) CHAPS (BDH Ltd, Poole, UK), 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, and 2% (v/v) ampholytes (Pharmalyte 3–10, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Samples were loaded onto the alkaline end of an immobilized pH gradient strip (pH 3–10, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) that had been rehydrated overnight in 0.5% (w/v) CHAPS, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 6m urea, and 2% (v/v) Pharmalyte 3-10. Isoelectric focusing was performed in a Multiphor II electrophoresis unit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). A broad pI isoelectric focusing calibration kit (pH 3–10; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was run in parallel with the ALS samples. The theoretical pI for the human ALS protein backbone was calculated using the program ISOELECTRIC from the Genetics Computer Group, Inc. (Madison, WI).Binding AssaysGel Filtration Studies with Mutated ALSSize fractionation chromatography was used to determine whether the seven site-directed mutant recombinant ALS species lacking individual consensusN-glycan linkage sites were able to form ternary complexes (18Baxter R.C. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1988; 67: 265-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Briefly, cross-linked [125I]IGF-I·IGFBP-3 (1 × 105 cpm) was incubated for 30 min at 25 °C with conditioned medium containing 150 ng of mutant ALS equilibrated in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 6.5) containing 1% (w/v) BSA, in a total volume of 200 μl. The mixture was then injected into a Superose-12 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and 0.5-ml fractions of eluate were collected at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. The degree of conversion from binary to ternary complex was evaluated by the shift of radioactivity from fractions corresponding to 50 kDa to those corresponding to 140 kDa (18Baxter R.C. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1988; 67: 265-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar).Lectin Solution Binding AssayA lectin solution binding assay was used to indicate the presence or absence of sialic acids on [125I]ALS after enzymatic desialylation with NANase III and deglycosylation with PNGase F as described above. Identical reactions were set up without enzymes as controls. The assay was modified from that of Abidi et al. (20Abidi F.E. Bishayee S. Bachhawat B.K. Bhadra R. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 257-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Briefly, approximately 35,000 cpm [125I]ALS (∼3.5 ng), either treated with enzyme or untreated control, was incubated for 1 h with 2 μg of the sialic acid-specific lectin from T. mobilensis in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer with 0.01% (w/v) BSA, pH 6.5 at 22 °C (final volume 100 μl). [125I]ALS complexed to the lectin was then precipitated using γ-globulin (35 μl) and 6% polyethylene glycol (1 ml) for 10 min at 4 °C. Both BSA and γ-globulin were acid-hydrolyzed and dialyzed against water to remove contaminating sialic acids (21Dorai D.T. Bachhawat B.K. Bishayee S. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 115: 130-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The tubes were then spun at 3500 rpm in a swing bucket centrifuge for 10 min at 22 °C. The radioactive pellet in each tube was measured as a percentage of the total radioactivity added and these data were used to generate histograms. Nonspecific binding was determined to be the radioactivity measured when no lectin was added to the tube during the 1-h incubation. Control and desialylated forms of [125I]ALS gave nonspecific binding ranging from 10% to 14% of total, and the PNGase F deglycosylated forms of [125I]ALS gave approximately 28% of total.Solution Binding Assay and Scatchard AnalysisSolution binding assays were carried out as described previously (16Baxter R.C. Bayne M.L. Cascieri M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 60-65Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 10,000 cpm [125I]ALS, either treated with enzyme or untreated control, was incubated for 2 h with 10 ng of IGF-I or -II and a range from 0 to 10 ng of IGFBP-3 in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.5, at 22 °C (final volume 0.3 ml). ALS complexed to IGFBP-3 was then precipitated using IGFBP-3 antiserum. The radioactivity in each tube was measured as a percentage of the total radioactivity added, and these data were used to generate binding curves. Endo F (58.3 milliunits/ng ALS) was added to a control untreated [125I]ALS preparation during the 2-h incubation to ensure that the presence of the enzyme did not adversely affect complex formation. Nonspecific binding was calculated as the percentage of radioactivity present after precipitation when there was no IGFBP-3 in the reaction mixture. For the Endo F deglycosylation experiments, nonspecific binding ranged from 3% to 18% of total for the partially deglycosylated forms and was approximately 30% of total for the fully deglycosylated forms. For the the NANase III binding curves, nonspecific binding was between 3% and 8% of the total. Scatchard analysis was carried out as described previously (16Baxter R.C. Bayne M.L. Cascieri M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 60-65Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), except that IGF-I, IGF-II, and IGFBP-3 were held constant at 1 ng/0.3 ml. ALS was added over the range of 0–200 ng/0.3 ml.Statistical AnalysesBinding curve data were analyzed by repeated measures analysis of variance, followed by Fisher's protected least significant difference test, using Statview 4.02 (Abacus Concepts Inc., Berkeley, CA). The value was considered significant if thep value was less than 0.05.DISCUSSIONThe interaction of ALS with IGF·IGFBP-3 complexes in the serum is believed to regulate both the function and the stability of the bound IGFs and IGFBP-3. Previous reports indicate that the affinity of IGFBP-3 for its ligands may be affected by post-translational modifications such as limited proteolysis (25Baxter R.C. Skriver L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 196: 1267-1273Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 26Bang P. Brismar K. Rosenfeld R.G. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1994; 78: 1119-1127Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 27Baxter R.C. Suikkari A.M. Martin J.L. Biochem. J. 1993; 294: 847-852Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). In this study, we found that the carbohydrate chains on ALS play an influential role in determining its interaction with IGFBP-3. Our data therefore suggest that modifications to ALS as well as IGFBP-3 may be important in fine-tuning the bioavailability of the IGFs.In addition to the seven putative N-linked carbohydrate attachment sites (NXS/T) in the ALS sequence, there are two putative O-linked glycan sites. The first, at Ser60, conforms to a mucin-type O-glycosylation site as predicted by NetOglyc 2.0 (28Hansen J.E. Lund O. Tolstrup N. Gooley A.A. Williams K.L. S. B. Glycoconj. J. 1998; 15: 115-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar) and is part of theN-linked carbohydrate attachment site at Asn58. The second, FT494PQP, corresponds to theXTPXP sequence recently described as the minimal requirement for O-linked carbohydrates (29Yoshida A. Suzuki M. Ikenaga H. Takeuchi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16884-16888Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) and lies adjacent to the putative N-linked glycosylation site, Asn448. Treatment of ALS with O-glycosidase, which hydrolyzes Galβ(1–3)GalNAc, a common core structure of manyO-linked glycans (30Umemoto J. Bhavanandan V.P. Davidson E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 8609-8614Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), had no effect on the molecular mass of ALS as judged by SDS-PAGE analysis. While it is possible that fucose residues may have interfered with the enzyme, or that a shift in size was below the level of detection, the putative O-linked sites do not appear to be occupied by sugar side chains with the common core structure described above. Furthermore, a lectin binding assay that was specific for sialic acids, a common residue onO-linked carbohydrates, also failed to provide evidence forO-linked sugars on ALS.Therefore, we focused on the N-linked carbohydrates of ALS and their role in ternary complex formation. Enzymatic removal of theN-linked sugars from ALS decreased its ability to form the complex with IGFBP-3 in a manner that was related to the level of deglycosylation. Intermediate levels of ALS deglycosylation, probably involving the loss of more than a single sugar chain, measurably disrupted ternary complex formation, whereas complete removal of theN-linked glycans abolished complex formation. However, when site-directed mutagenesis was used to mutate each of theN-linked attachment sites individually, no single glycan appeared to have a major impact on ALS binding activity. Therefore, the carbohydrates on ALS clearly influence the affinity that ALS has for the IGF·IGFBP-3 complex, although this influence relies on a number of N-linked sugars rather than any single chain. However, it is not clear whether deglycosylated ALS is less able to form the ternary complex because of conformational changes in ALS induced by removal of the glycans or disruption of interactions between the ALS carbohydrates and the other two proteins.Sialic acids are common anionic residues that can be attached to bothN- and O-linked sugars. They can contribute significant charge to glycoproteins as many sialic acids can be attached to one highly branched N-linked sugar. For example, the acute-phase protein α1-acid glycoprotein has a pI of 2–3 mostly due to the large number of sialic acids attached to its highly branched complex N-linked sugars (31Van Dijk W. Havenaar E.C. Brinkman-van der Linden E.C.M. Glycoconj. J. 1995; 12: 227-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). The calculated pI of ALS, based on its amino acid sequence, is 6.56; however, we observed six discrete isoforms of pI 4.6–5.3 by isoelectric focusing. After NANase III treatment, the pI of ALS increased to between 5.5 and 7, close to the predicted value for the amino acid backbone. The contribution of negative charge by the sialic acid may explain, in part, the high affinity with which ALS binds to weak anion exchange columns used in ALS purification (3Baxter R.C. Martin J.L. Beniac V.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 11843-11848Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Given that the sialic acid contributes significantly to the negative charge on ALS and that the interactions within the ternary complex are dependent on charge, it could be predicted that the sialic acid on ALS would affect the formation of the complex. Indeed, ALS treated with NANase III to remove sialic acid displayed a 50–80% decrease in affinity for the IGF-I and IGF-II binary complexes compared with that of untreated ALS. However, it is noteworthy that desialylation only lowered the affinity of ALS for the IGF·IGFBP-3 complex unlike deglycosylation, which abolished complex formation. This suggests that the effects of ALS glycosylation on IGFBP-3 binding are not entirely due to the negative charges imparted by sialic acid.The results from the N-linked glycan studies imply that a number of N-linked sugars are required to act in concert to enable ALS to interact with IGFBP-3 and the IGFs, rather than a specific carbohydrate chain being solely responsible. The placement of the glycans within the tertiary structure of ALS may shed light on this finding. In unpublished studies, 2J. B. M. Janosi, P. A. Ramsland, M. Mott, S. M. Firth, R. C. Baxter, and P. J. D. Delhanty, unpublished data. we have modeled the central leucine-rich repeat region of ALS on the only published crystal structure of a leucine-rich repeat protein, the porcine ribonuclease inhibitor (32Kobe B. Deisenhofer J. Nature. 1993; 366: 751-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar). If the modeled structure is a true representation of ALS, then six out of the seven potential N-linked sugar attachment sites lie very close to each other, suggesting a possible clustering of carbohydrate chains. Therefore, the loss of any singleN-linked glycan may be compensated by the potentially large number of other carbohydrates in the vicinity. This model also has implications with regard to the sialic acid moieties that we demonstrated to exist on ALS. A lectin solution binding assay suggested that all the sialic acids on ALS are attached to theN-linked sugars. These sialic acid moieties might therefore result in a region of negative charge where the N-linked sugars are concentrated.The binding affinity of ALS to the IGF·IGFBP-3 complex is relatively weak, 1–2 orders of magnitude less than the affinity of IGFBP-3 for either of the IGFs (13Holman S.R. Baxter R.C. Growth Regul. 1996; 6: 42-47PubMed Google Scholar), and in this sense ALS binding is the limiting step in ternary complex formation. This suggests that modulation of ALS affinity might directly influence complex formation, and thus the bioavailability of IGFs. Isoelectric focusing indicates that ALS purified from normal serum already exists as a number of differently sialylated isoforms. If the degree of ALS sialylation is subject to physiological regulation, as described for other proteins (31Van Dijk W. Havenaar E.C. Brinkman-van der Linden E.C.M. Glycoconj. J. 1995; 12: 227-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), the potential exists for modulation of formation or stability of the ternary complexes. This might occur in addition to the previously described modulation of the circulating concentration of the ALS protein itself (33Delhanty P.J.D. Takano K. Hizuka N. Takahashi S.I. The Regulation and Actions of ALS: Molecular Mechanisms to Regulate the Activities of Insulin-like Growth Factors. Elsevier Science B. V., Amsterdam1998: 135-143Google Scholar) through cytokine suppression (34Delhanty P.J.D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 243: 269-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) or in patients who are critically ill (35Baxter R.C. Hawker F.H. To C. Stewart P.M. Holman S.R. Growth Regul. 1997; 7: 1-10Google Scholar) or have hepatic cirrhosis (36Donaghy A.J. Baxter R.C. Baillieres Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1996; 10: 421-446Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar).In summary, we have found that the N-linked carbohydrates on ALS are a requirement for the formation of complexes with IGFBP-3 and IGFs. We have also shown that the removal of sialic acids from ALS significantly reduces the affinity of ALS for binding to IGFBP-3. Since the glycosylation of secreted proteins are often modified in certain physiological and pathological states, the modification of ALS glycosylation has the potential to be an important factor in the regulation of IGF access to the tissues.

CyPA binds to the previously identified Gly-Pro90 site of the capsid protein p24, but its role remained unclear. Here we report two new interaction sites between cyclophilins and p24. Both are located in the C-terminal domain of p24 around Gly-Pro157 and Gly-Pro224. Peptides corresponding to these regions showed higher affinities (K d ∼ 0.3 μm) for both CyPA and cyclophilin B than the best peptide derived from the Gly-Pro90 site (∼8 μm) and thus revealed new sequence motifs flanking Gly-Pro that are important for tight interaction of peptide ligands with cyclophilins. Between CyPA and an immature (unprocessed) form of p24, a K d of ∼8 μm was measured, which corresponded with theK d of the best of the Gly-Pro90peptides, indicating an association via this site. Processing of immature p24 by the viral protease, yielding mature p24, elicited a conformational change in its C-terminal domain that was signaled by the covalently attached fluorescence label acrylodan. Consequently, CyPA and cyclophilin B bound with much higher affinities (∼0.6 and 0.25 μm) to the new, i.e. maturation-generated sites. Since this domain is essential for p24 oligomerization and capsid cone formation, CyPA bound to the new sites might impair the regularity of the capsid cone and thus facilitate in vivocore disassembly after host infection.

CyPA, and CyPB, cyclophilin, cyclophilin A, and cyclophilin B, respectively HIV-1 capsid protein p24 cyclosporin A human immunodeficiency virus type-1 high performance liquid chromatography major homology region peptidyl-prolyl cis-transisomerase 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid The cyclophilins represent a ubiquitous family of proteins that are abundant in nearly every cell type and are highly conserved through evolution (1Galat A. Metcalfe S.M. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1995; 63: 67-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). The main representative of the cyclophilins in mammals is the cytosolic 18-kDa CyPA.1 The closely related CyPB (21 kDa) contains a N-terminal signal sequence that directs this isoform to the endoplasmic reticulum. A characteristic property of cyclophilins is their peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase (PPIase) activity and their ability to bind cyclosporin A (CsA) that inhibits the PPIase activity. In T cells, the CsA·CyPA complex associates with and inhibits the Ca2+-dependent protein phosphatase calcineurin, resulting in immunosuppression. Natural endogenous ligands of cyclophilins with similar actions as CsA are unknown, and the cellular functions of cyclophilins are still a matter of investigation. A new important property of cyclophilins was found in the human immunodeficiency virus life cycle (2Franke E.K. Yuan H.E.H. Luban J.

Goff S.P. Cell. 1993; 73: 1067-1078Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (697) Google Scholar) was detected. During or after budding of immature viral particles out of the host cell, the noninfectious virions with a spherical core consisting of Gag proteins are transformed to infectious virions and undergo a dramatic structural rearrangement to an icosahedral shape (5Nermut M.V. Grief C. Hockley D.J. AIDS Res. Hum. Retroviruses. 1993; 9: 929-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). In the course of this maturation, the pol-encoded HIV protease processes the Gag polyprotein precursor into three major proteins and three smaller polypeptides (6Henderson L.E. Bowers M.A. Sowder II, R.C. Serabyn S.A. Johnson D.G. Bess Jr., J.W. Arthur L.O. Bryant D.K. Fenselau C. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 1856-1865Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Jones I. Stuart D. Nature Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 818-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). The capsid protein p24, consisting of a N-terminal and a C-terminal domain, condenses to form the conical core structure surrounding the viral genome. One CyPA molecule per 10 Gag molecules is incorporated into nascent virions, amounting to a total of ∼200 molecules/virion (2Franke E.K. Yuan H.E.H. Luban J. Nature. 1994; 372: 359-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (645) Google Scholar, 3Thali M. Bukovsky A. Kondo E. Rosenwirth B. Walsh C.T. Sodroski J. Göttlinger H.G. Nature. 1994; 372: 363-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar). CyPB was shown to form in vitrosimilar complexes with the Gag polyprotein as CyPA but was not found in virions in vivo (2Franke E.K. Yuan H.E.H. Luban J. Nature. 1994; 372: 359-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (645) Google Scholar). The interaction with the Gag polyprotein and p24 is mediated by the active site of CyPA and is suppressed in the presence of CsA or SDZ NIM811 (3Thali M. Bukovsky A. Kondo E. Rosenwirth B. Walsh C.T. Sodroski J. Göttlinger H.G. Nature. 1994; 372: 363-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar, 8Billich A. Hammerschmid F. Peichl P. Wenger R. Zenke G. Quesniaux V. Rosenwirth B. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 2451-2461Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), a natural nonimmunosuppressive CsA analog that also binds to CyPA and inhibits its PPIase activity. CsA prevents the incorporation of CyPA but inhibits neither the assembly of viral components nor the production of morphologically intact virions (9Braaten D. Franke E.K. Luban J. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 3551-3560Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, virions lacking CyPA were found to be considerably reduced in their propagation (10Luban J. Cell. 1996; 87: 1157-1159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Single point mutations in the p24 domain of the Gag polyprotein precursor revealed a region with an array of four proline residues to be involved in binding to CyPA (2Franke E.K. Yuan H.E.H. Luban J. Nature. 1994; 372: 359-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (645) Google Scholar). Recently, the crystal structure of CyPA complexed with a domain of p24 encompassing the N-terminal two-thirds (residues 1–151) showed binding of CyPA to the proline-rich segment that forms a flexible surface-exposed loop in the mainly α-helical p24 fragment (11Gamble T.R. Vajdos F.F. Yoo S. Worthylake D.K. Houseweart M. Sundquist W.I. Hill C.P. Cell. 1996; 87: 1285-1294Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar). The contact region on the p24 loop is restricted to a relatively small area with Gly-Pro90 as the central element buried in the active site of CyPA. This Gly-Pro motif seems to be a prerequisite for stable association. Only if glycine precedes a proline residue is the peptide stretch able to snuggle deeply into the active site of CyPA. So far, the role of CyPA in the interaction with HIV-1 p24 is not clear. CyPA might act as PPIase and catalyze a cis-transisomerization in the p24 peptide backbone or might function as chaperone by binding the capsid protein in a conformation prone for propagation, i.e. by destabilizing the capsid cone for postentry disassembly (10Luban J. Cell. 1996; 87: 1157-1159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Such an action of CyPA, however, could not be expected to result solely from binding to the site on the loop around Gly-Pro90 in the N-terminal domain. Very recently, it was reported that CyPA disrupts high order p24 complexes, most probably by interfering with p24-p24 interactions (12Agresta B.E. Carter C.A. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 6921-6927Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As the assembly and disassembly of p24 occur both in the same compartment of the host cell, it remained a puzzle how this CyPA·p24 (Gly-Pro90) interaction should initiate capsid cone disassembly without already affecting viral assembly. In the present investigation, we have identified two additional CyPA-binding sites in the C-terminal domain of mature p24 capsid protein. Both sites show higher affinities for CyPA and CyPB than the Gly-Pro90 site of p24. These two high affinity binding sites seem to be accessible for CyPA only in the mature p24 capsid protein, i.e. after processing of immature p24 by the HIV-1 protease. A hypothetical model of the function of CyPA in the disassembly of the capsid cone is proposed. Recombinant immature HIV-1 capsid protein was obtained from D. Sizmann (Hoffmann-La Roche, Basel) in 6 mguanidine HCl and was efficiently refolded by an established method (13Hausdorf G. Gewiess A. Wray V. Porstmann T. J. Virol. Methods. 1994; 50: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 14Misselwitz R. Hausdorf G. Welfle K. Höhne W.E. Welfle H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1250: 9-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) into a correctly folded soluble protein. Folded immature capsid protein was analyzed by CD spectroscopy with regard to secondary structure composition. The obtained CD spectra were comparable ([θ222]mre: −15,970 millidegrees·M−1·cm2) with that reported for native p24 (14Misselwitz R. Hausdorf G. Welfle K. Höhne W.E. Welfle H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1250: 9-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The correct mass was verified by mass spectrometry, and the protein concentration was determined by quantitative amino acid analysis. The concentration of p24 stock solutions was always kept below 1 mg/ml to avoid aggregation (15Ehrlich L.S. Agresta B.E. Carter C.A. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 4874-4883Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). PPIase-active recombinant human CyPA and CyPB were a gift from M. Zurini (Novartis, Basel). Synthetic peptides p(87–101), p(153–172), and p(214–228) were purchased from Neosystem Laboratoire (Strasbourg). In order to obtain mature p24, folded immature p24 protein was incubated with 1/100 (w/w) of recombinant HIV-1 protease in 30 mm MES, pH 5.5, 200 mm NaCl, 1% (w/w) glycerol, and 1 mm EDTA at 37 °C. The reaction was monitored by analyzing aliquots with SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and silver staining (Phast gels, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Usually, processing was complete after 4–6 h. The reaction was stopped by adjusting the pH to 8.0. Subsequently, 100 μm EDTA and 5 μmphenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride was added, and the sample was dialyzed against 3 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 20 mm NaCl to remove cleaved peptides (2.8 and 2.3 kDa) and vacuum-concentrated up to a concentration of ≤1 mg/ml. The concentration of p24 was determined by quantitative amino acid analysis (AminoQuant, Hewlett-Packard) and was in agreement with the concentrations determined by measuring the absorbance at 280 nm (ε280: 33.7 mm−1 cm−1; Ref. 14Misselwitz R. Hausdorf G. Welfle K. Höhne W.E. Welfle H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1250: 9-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). An aliquot (20 pmol) of the obtained product was analyzed by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (C8-reversed phase HPLC linked to an API III+ electrospray ionization mass spectrometer; PE-Sciex), revealing a molecular mass of 25,578.3 ± 3 Da that was in agreement with the calculated molecular mass of 25,579.5 Da for mature p24. The CD spectrum of processed,i.e. mature, p24 protein was comparable with that reported for native HIV-1 capsid protein (14Misselwitz R. Hausdorf G. Welfle K. Höhne W.E. Welfle H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1250: 9-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) and had a mean residue ellipticity of −13,420 millidegrees·M−1·cm2 at 222 nm. Folded immature p24 (10 μm) was dialyzed against 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, and 10 μm dithiothreitol and then incubated with acrylodan (6-acryloyl-2-dimethylaminonaphthalene, 10-fold molar excess over sulfhydryl groups; Molecular Probes Europe BV) in 50 mmHEPES, pH 7.0, 5% (v/v) acetonitrile, and 0.5 m guanidine HCl (a concentration at which native p24 is still stable according to Ref. 14Misselwitz R. Hausdorf G. Welfle K. Höhne W.E. Welfle H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1250: 9-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) for 2 h at room temperature in the dark on a rotary device. The reaction mixture subsequently was loaded onto a PD10 gel filtration column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and eluted with 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, 5% (v/v) acetonitrile, and 0.2m guanidine HCl. Protein (p24)-containing fractions were pooled; dialyzed against 2 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, 6 mm NaCl, 6 mm KCl, and 1% (v/v) acetonitrile; and vacuum-concentrated to a concentration still below 1 mg/ml. Mass and UV spectroscopy of the product revealed only monolabeled p24 (most probably at Cys218; see Ref. 16McDermott J. Farrell L. Ross R. Barklis E. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 5106-5114Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with 0.3 mol of acrylodan incorporated per mol of p24. In order to obtain acrylodan-labeled mature p24, labeled immature p24 was treated with HIV-1 protease as described before and proven by mass spectroscopy to be correctly processed. Fluorescence measurements were performed at 25 °C with a spectrofluorimeter (model A1010 equipped with FELIX fluorescence analysis software; Photon Technology International). Excitation was set to 370 nm (3-nm bandwidth), and emission was recorded from 400 to 600 nm (3-nm bandwidth). In order to measure dissociation constants of the complexes between the cyclophilins and mature or immature p24, CyPA or CyPB was added at the indicated concentrations to labeled mature p24 (1.2 or 0.1 μm) or to labeled immature p24 (1.0 μm) in 20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, 60 mm NaCl, and 60 mm KCl. After each addition, the mixture was incubated until equilibrium had been reached before recording the spectra. In order to calculate K dvalues, the change in relative fluorescence was fitted (SigmaPlot, Jandel Corp.) according to the following equation: ΔF= (ΔF max/2 × L t) × [(L t + P t +K d) − {(L t +P t + K d)2 − (4 × L t × P t)}0.5], where ΔF is the relative fluorescence change, ΔF max is the maximal change,L t is the total concentration of p24,P t is the total concentration of CyP, andK d is the dissociation equilibrium constant.K d values of independent experiments were within the indicated calculated S.D. values (Table I).Table IInhibition (Ki) and dissociation equilibrium (Kd) constants of various ligands for cyclophilinsLigandsCyclophilin ACyclophilin BK iaK i values were obtained by inhibiting PPIase activity as described in Fig. 3.

Open table in a new tab PPIase activity was measured at 4 °C essentially as recently described (17Endrich M.M. Grossenbacher D. Geistlich A. Gehring H. Biol. Cell. 1996; 88: 15-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) with the standard chymotrypsin-coupled assay (18Harrison R.K. Stein R.K. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 3813-3816Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). The assay mixture (0.08 mNaCl, 0.05 m Hepes, pH 8; final volume 200 μl) contained 50 μm of succinyl-Ala-Leu-Pro-Phe-p-nitroanilide (Bachem) and was incubated for at least 10 min at 4 °C. The reaction was started by the addition of chymotrypsin (60 μm) and monitored at λ 390 nm with a Hewlett-Packard 8450A UV/VIS-spectrophotometer. For competition experiments, recombinant human CyPA (1–5 nm) or CyPB (8–21 nm) was preincubated with or without the corresponding p24 component in the presence of 0.5 μmbovine serum albumin for 1 h at room temperature prior to chymotrypsin addition. In the case of peptide p(214–228), the assay mixture additionally contained 250 μm dithiothreitol. The apparent reaction rate constant k obs was obtained by analyzing the exponential phase (50–500 s) of the curve according to a pseudo-first order reaction. The rate of the spontaneous, uncatalyzed isomerization k uncat(0.0036 ± 0.0002 s−1, at 4 °C) was subtracted from k obs. The percentage inhibition was calculated in relation to the PPIase activity measured in the absence of competitors. In general, each measurement was performed twice, and the average was calculated. Obtained data were fitted according to the equation for competitive inhibition: percentage inhibition = [(100 × I t)/(I t + IC50)], where I t is the total concentration of the competitor and IC50 corresponds to [K i × (1 + (S/K m))].K i is the inhibition constant of the competitor, S is the concentration of the PPIase substrate used in the standard assay, and K m is the Michaelis-Menten constant of the substrate. Since S/K m was approximately 120 for the used PPIase substrate, the IC50 values are reflecting K i values. Fragments of p24 were obtained by incubating recombinant HIV-1 p24 protein with 1/50 (w/w) of 1-chloro-3-tosylamido-7-amino-2-heptanone-pretreated α-chymotrypsin (Boehringer Mannheim) in 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mm CaCl2 and 1 m guanidine HCl for 1 h at 37 °C. The reaction was stopped by the addition of phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride. An aliquot of the digested mixture corresponding to 0.57 nmol (17.4 μg) of original p24 protein was preincubated with or without 0.4 nmol (7.1 μg) of recombinant human CyPA in binding buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 60 mm NaCl, 60 mm KCl, 2 mmCaCl2, and 2 mm MgCl2) for 1 h at room temperature. Subsequently, the reaction mixture (100 μl) was loaded onto a gel filtration column (G25 Superfine, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech; 10 × 85 mm) and eluted with the same buffer containing 10 mm guanidine HCl at 2 ml/min. CyPA-containing fractions (0.5 ml) were adjusted to pH 2 with trifluoroacetic acid and were directly injected onto a C8-reversed phase HPLC column (4.6 × 220 mm; Brownlee). Elution was performed with HPLC buffer A (0.1% trifluoroacetic acid) and a gradient of buffer B (80% acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid) at 1 ml/min. Alternatively, recombinant HIV-1 p24 was chemically fragmented by cyanogen bromide in 1 m guanidine HCl and 70% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid for 20 h at room temperature in the dark. The mixture was lyophilized, resuspended in 5% acetonitrile and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, and desalted by reversed phase HPLC. Fractions following the run-through were pooled, vacuum-concentrated, mixed with binding buffer, and incubated with or without CyPA for 1 h at room temperature prior to fast gel filtration chromatography. HPLC-purified extracted CyPA-binding peptides were N-terminally sequenced by automated Edman degradation. Biotinylation of p(87–101) was carried out by incubating HPLC-purified peptide (in 100 mm Hepes, pH 8.0) with a 1.5-fold molar excess of NHS-Biotin (Sigma), dissolved in Me2SO, for 1 h at room temperature. Excess reagent was trapped by the addition of glycine (2-fold molar excess over NHS-Biotin). The product was purified on a C18-reversed phase HPLC column (3.9 × 150 mm; Waters) and proved to be correct by mass spectrometry and quantitative amino acid analysis. For acetylation of p(153–172), acetic anhydride (3-fold molar excess, dissolved in 20 mm acetic acid) was added dropwise to a well stirred solution of HPLC-purified peptide in 200 mmsodium phosphate, pH 7.0, on ice. After 30 min, the reaction was stopped by the addition of 2 m hydroxylamine HCl in 0.5m Tris-HCl, pH 9.6. The product was purified on a C8-reversed phase HPLC column (4.6 × 220 mm; Brownlee) and quantified by amino acid analysis. Fragment ion mass spectrum of the triply charged peptide ion proved the peptide to be exclusively N-terminally acetylated. The presence of a reactive cysteine residue at position 218 of p24 (see Ref. 16McDermott J. Farrell L. Ross R. Barklis E. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 5106-5114Crossref PubMed Google Scholar and Fig.1 B) was utilized to introduce the sulfhydryl-specific, environmentally sensitive fluorophore acrylodan (19Schmid D. Baici A. Gehring H. Christen P. Science. 1994; 263: 971-973Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar) into immature p24 (see “Experimental Procedures”). Although formation of an intramolecular disulfide bond between Cys198 and Cys218 has been observed in a truncated p24 encompassing the C-terminal domain (20Gamble T.R. Yoo S. Vajdos F.F. von Schwedler U.K. Worthylake D.K. Wang H. McCutcheon J.P. Sundquist W.I. Hill C.P. Science. 1997; 278: 849-853Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar), such a disulfide bond could not be shown under physiological conditions (16McDermott J. Farrell L. Ross R. Barklis E. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 5106-5114Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and is not expected, since the Gag precursor folds and oligomerizes in the reducing environment of the host cell. Acrylodan-labeled immature p24 exhibited maximal fluorescence emission at 498 nm when excited at 370 nm (Fig. 2, C andD). Upon the addition of CyPA, the fluorescence of labeled immature p24 increased in intensity and underwent a blue shift. A dissociation equilibrium constant, K d, of 8.2 μm (Table I) was calculated from the binding curve (Fig. 2 C). In contrast, the fluorescence intensity of labeled immature p24 decreased upon the addition of CyPB (Fig. 2 D), and a K d of 0.9 μm (Table I) was determined. The observed changes in relative fluorescence of labeled immature p24 upon the addition of CyPA or -B were abolished in the presence of CsA, yielding the same fluorescence spectrum as that of unbound immature p24.Figure 2Binding of CyPA and CyPB to acrylodan-labeled mature and immature p24. Titration of acrylodan-labeled mature p24 (A and B) as well as labeled immature p24 (C and D) with recombinant human CyPA (A and C) or CyPB (B and D) is shown as the change in relative fluorescence at λmax. The corresponding fluorescence emission spectra are shown in theinsets, and the emission spectra of unbound labeled p24 are indicated by dashed lines. Experimental data were fitted as described under “Experimental Procedures,” and the calculated K d values are summarized in TableI.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) In order to determine the binding characteristics of mature p24, folded immature p24 was correctly processed to mature p24 by the HIV-1 protease, which is also responsible for in vivo processing of the Gag polyprotein. The fluorescence spectra of unliganded acrylodan-labeled mature p24 exhibited maximal emission at 508 nm (Fig.2, A and B). The fluorescence decreased in intensity upon the addition of CyPA or CyPB without a perceivable shift in λmax. The K d values for the CyPA·p24 complex and for the CyPB·p24 were calculated from their respective binding curves (Fig. 2, A and B; TableI). The contribution of the acrylodan label to the binding of p24 to CyP was negligible, as judged by acrylodan-labeled β-mercaptoethanol that did not show any change in fluorescence intensity upon CyP addition. Again, upon the addition of CsA to the mixture of CyP and p24, the fluorescence spectrum was the same as that of unbound p24. Thus, CsA prevented also the interactions of CyPA and CyPB with labeled mature p24, demonstrating specific binding of labeled p24 in the active site of the cyclophilins. To verify the binding properties obtained with the fluorimetric measurements, the inhibitory effect of immature p24 on the PPIase activity of CyPA and CyPB was determined. Immature p24 inhibited the PPIase activity of CyPB (K i ∼ 1.2 μm; Fig.3) more efficiently than that of CyPA (K i ∼ 8.5 μm). BothK i values were in excellent agreement with the fluorimetrically determined K d values. Due to the presence of a His6 tag in immature p24 (Fig. 1), preformed complexes between CyPA and immature p24 could be precipitated with Ni2+-agarose and quantified by densitometric analysis of silver-stained protein bands after SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The calculated apparent dissociation equilibrium constant K d′ of ∼19 μm obtained from experiments in which relative low concentrations have been used (0.25 μm p24 and 25 nm to 2.5 μmCyPA) is, as expected (due to a certain dissociation during the procedure), higher (∼2-fold) than the K d andK i values (Table I). CsA efficiently disrupted the complex (i.e. no CyPA was co-precipitated with immature p24 in the presence of CsA). Mature p24 was, in contrast to immature p24, susceptible to cleavage by chymotrypsin (used in high concentrations in the standard PPIase activity assay; see “Experimental Procedures”). Most of it was found to be degraded upon analysis by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis at the end of the assay. Nevertheless, the PPIase activity of CyPA and CyPB was effectively inhibited at lower concentrations of mature p24 than of immature p24 (Fig. 3). In the case of CyPB, nanomolar concentrations of mature p24 already inhibited part of the PPIase activity of CyPB, but complete inhibition was achieved only at higher concentrations (>10 μm). Therefore, the fluorimetrically determined K d values seem to reflect the true binding affinities of mature p24 (Table I). The higher affinity of mature p24 as compared with immature p24 with cyclophilins indicates that additional binding sites on p24 become accessible after the precursor is processed by the HIV-1 protease. To map potential CyPA-binding sites on HIV-1 p24, chymotryptic fragments of recombinant p24 were incubated with human CyPA and subjected to a fast size exclusion chromatography (Fig.4). CyPA-bound peptide segments of p24 co-eluted together with CyPA in the void volume. CyPA-containing fractions were analyzed by reversed-phase HPLC (Fig. 4,D–F). Five CyPA-associated p24 peptides (I–V) were found and identified by mass spectrometry. Peptide I corresponded to the four proline residue-containing sequence 81–117, which encompasses the known Gly-Pro90 site (Fig. 1 B). The molecular mass of peptide II mapped to C-terminal fragment 187–227 of mature p24 containing a Gly-Pro sequence element. Peptides III, IV, and V, consisting of residues 152–185, 130–164, and 153–187, respectively, overlap in the major homology region (MHR) of p24 (21Wills J.W. Craven R.C.

Hoffman L.R. Wolfsberg T.G. White J.M. Annu. Rev. Cell. Dev. Biol. 1996; 12: 627-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar). The fusion domain within the transmembrane (TM)1 proteins has been shown to be responsible for virus-cell fusion (2Cao J. Bergeron L. Helseth E. Thali M. Repke H. Sodroski J. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 2747-2755Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For a majority of viruses, the fusion peptide, which penetrates into the target membrane, has been found at the NH2 terminus of the TM subunit (3White J.M. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1990; 52: 675-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). A conformational change in the fusion domain of the virus, triggered by low pH (4White J.M. Matlin K. Helenius A. J. Cell Biol. 1981; 89: 674-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar) or binding to the receptors (5Sattentau Q.J. Moore J.P. J. Exp. Biol. 1990; 174: 407-415Google Scholar) leading to exposure of the fusion peptide, has been proposed to be an important intermediate step for virus-mediated fusions (for review, see Ref. 6Chan D.C. Kim P.S. Cell. 1998; 93: 681-684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1112) Google Scholar). As suggested by many experiments, the fusion proteins oligomerize in the fusogenic state (7Bullough P.A. Hughson F.M. Skehel J.J. Wiley D.C. Nature. 1994; 371: 37-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (1376) Google Scholar), and the fusion pore is believed to be composed of several oligomeric units of fusion proteins (8Spruce A. Iwata A. Almers W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 3623-3627Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 9Ellens H. Bentz J. Mason D. Zhang F. White J.M.

Thus, accumulation of the virus glycoproteins has also been found at the cell-cell contact region (11Aroeti B. Henis Y.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15845-15849Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recently an early fusion active conformation of HIV-1 TM gp41 has been detected using an inhibitory synthetic peptide (12Furuta R.A. Wild C.T. Weng Y. Weiss C.D. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 276-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar). Recent structural studies by x-ray crystallography on the hemagglutinin of influenza virus (7Bullough P.A. Hughson F.M. Skehel J.J. Wiley D.C. Nature. 1994; 371: 37-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (1376) Google Scholar) and the TM glycoprotein gp41 of human immunodeficiency virus revealed that the core of the fusion domain consists of an inner triple-stranded coiled-coil buttressed by three helices formed by the COOH-terminal region of the ectodomain of the envelope glycoproteins (13Chan D.C. Fass D. Berger J.M. Kim P.S. Cell. 1997; 89: 263-273Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1834) Google Scholar, 14Weissenhorn W. Dessen A. Harrison S.C. Skehel J.J. Wiley D.C.

A. 1997; 94: 12303-12308Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar). An anti-parallel core complex of the fusion domain of fusion-mediating virus has also been deduced from a recent solution NMR study on a truncated protein derived from the ectodomain of simian immunodeficiency virus (16Caffrey M. Cai M. Kaufmann J. Stahl S.J. Wingfield P.T. Covell D.G. Gronenborn A.M. Clore G.M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4572-4584Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). The common features of these helix bundles are that the central coiled-coil trimer is formed by the leucine zipper-like heptad repeat sequence and that the height of the cylinder of the complexes is at least 60 Å. Thus, it is of interest to examine how the fusion complex containing several long rigid cylinders initiates approach of the merging membranes. The function of the NH2-terminal fusion peptide of gp41 has been characterized, and the ensuing more polar region has been shown to associate with the surface subunit, gp120, of the external domain of HIV-1 env glycoprotein. These two regions of gp41 have also been implicated in the viral fusion by mutational studies (17Freed E.O. Myers D.J. Risser R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 4650-4654Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). Despite elucidation of the core of the viral fusion domain complex by the x-ray diffraction and NMR studies, the structural role in the fusion event of the fusion peptide and the intervening sequence between it and the zipper-like region has not been addressed. To better define the role of a given domain in the functions of a protein, a peptide corresponding to that segment can be studied (18O'Shea E.K. Rutkowski R. Kim P.S. Science. 1989; 243: 538-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (697) Google Scholar, 19Wild C. Dubay J.W. Greenwell T. Baird Jr., T. Oas T.G. McDanal C. Huntter E. Matthews T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In particular, the NH2-terminal hydrophobic peptides have been found to cause cell lysis, to induce electric current, and to promote lipid mixing in liposomes (21Slepushkin V.A. Andreev S.M. Sidorova M.V. Melikyan G.B. Grigoriev V.B. Chumakov V.M. Grinfeldt A.E. Manukyan R.A. Karamov E.V. AIDS Res. Hum. Retroviruses. 1992; 8: 9-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 22Rafalski M. Lear J.D. De Grado W.F. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 7917-7922Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). A peptide corresponding to amino acids 5 through 16 of gp41 has been found to induce current under external applied voltage (21Slepushkin V.A. Andreev S.M. Sidorova M.V. Melikyan G.B. Grigoriev V.B. Chumakov V.M. Grinfeldt A.E. Manukyan R.A. Karamov E.V. AIDS Res. Hum. Retroviruses. 1992; 8: 9-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The interaction with SDS micelle, on the atomic scale, of the 23-amino acid peptide corresponding to the NH2-terminal region of gp41 has been studied recently (23Chang D.K. Cheng S.F. Chien W.J. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 6593-6602Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It was found that Ala-Gly dipeptide, located 15 and 16 residues from the NH2 terminus of gp41, is at the micellar-aqueous boundary and the region COOH-terminal to it is flexible. In view of the highly conserved nature of the NH2-terminal region of gp41 implying its important structural role in the fusion (24), we report here the structure and conformations of a peptide encompassing amino acids 5 through 55 of gp41, under varying solution conditions. Using NMR, circular dichroism spectroscopies, light scattering, and gel filtration chromatography we attempt to further unravel the virus-mediated cell fusion in light of the reported oligomeric core structure of gp41 (13Chan D.C. Fass D. Berger J.M. Kim P.S. Cell. 1997; 89: 263-273Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1834) Google Scholar, 14Weissenhorn W. Dessen A. Harrison S.C. Skehel J.J. Wiley D.C. Nature. 1997; 387: 426-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (1460) Google Scholar, 16Caffrey M. Cai M. Kaufmann J. Stahl S.J. Wingfield P.T. Covell D.G. Gronenborn A.M. Clore G.M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4572-4584Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). The NMR methods are particularly suited for our purposes because they afford atomic resolution, the observation of conformational change in aqueous and membrane-mimic environments, and information regarding the flexibility of the specific regions in the peptides or proteins under study. In combination with the crystalline structural data on the core complex of gp41 external domain, the results show the physical properties for the NH2-terminal region of the TM glycoprotein gp41 and suggest the conformational transition during the fusion event and the hemifusion intermediate. Similar changes in conformation and assembly state may also occur in the fusion process of other enveloped viruses such as influenza virus. The peptide (formyl-GALFLGFLGAAGSTMGARSMTLTVQARQLLSGIVQQQNNLLRAIEAQQHLL-OH, gp41-N51) corresponding to amino acids 5–55 of gp41 and the peptide (NH2-YTSLIHSLIEESQNQQEKNEQELLELDKWASLWNWF-OH, gp41-C36) corresponding to amino acids 127–162 from strain LAV1a (LAV, lymph adenopathy-associated virus) were synthesized in an automated mode by a solid phase synthesizer from Applied Biosystems (Foster City, CA) model 431A using Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) chemistry. The peptides were cleaved from the resins by trifluoroacetic acids and purified by reverse phase high-performance liquid chromatography using a C8 column. The primary sequence of the peptide was ascertained by electrospray mass spectrometry as well as amino acid analysis. SDS (sodium dodecyl sulfate) was acquired from Boehringer Mannheim (Mannheim, Germany) and d25-SDS from Cambridge Isotope (Andover, MA). 1,2-Ditetradecanoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (PC) and 1,2-dihexadecanoyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-l-serine (PS) were acquired from Calbiochem (San Diego, CA). Lysozyme (molecular mass: 14.4 kDa) was purchased from Sigma. All reagents were used in the experiments without further purification. Solutions containing vesicles are prepared by solubilizing the lipids in chloroform:methanol (4:1, v/v) mixture and drying the sample under nitrogen stream before dissolving in buffer solution. Mixtures of peptides and SDS or phospholipids were sonicated for at least 0.5 h before measurements. Micellar solutions containing 1 mm gp41-N51 and 60–100 mm d25-SDS were used for NMR measurements. One-dimensional and two-dimensional nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy and total correlation spectroscopy NMR experiments were performed in a Bruker AMX500 spectrometer as described previously (23Chang D.K. Cheng S.F. Chien W.J. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 6593-6602Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The NOE data were converted into interproton distance using 2H/3H cross-peak of the aromatic ring of phenylalanine as reference. A range of 0.6–1.0 Å was allowed to vary in the distance constraints in the structural computation. 1 mm each of lysozyme and gp41-N51 in D2O solutions was used in pulsed field gradient experiments for the diffusion coefficient (D s) determination. Temperature was kept at 298 K. The signal attenuation at time 2τ relative to that at time 0 is given by the equation, ln(A2τ/A0)=−(γδG)2·(Δ−δ/3)·DsEquation 1 where γ is the 1H gyromagnetic ratio, δ is pulse field gradient duration, G is the gradient strength in gauss cm−1, Δ is the diffusion delay time. The diffusion coefficient of methanol was used to calibrate the gradient strength. In the experiments, δ and Δ were kept at 11 and 14 ms, respectively, while G was varied systematically. The maximum Gwas set at 45 gauss cm−1. According to Stokes-Einstein equation, D s is inversely proportional to the hydrodynamic radius of a spherical particle, hence it is inversely proportional to the molecular mass to the one-third power. For CD measurements, cells with path lengths of 0.5–1.0 mm were employed in final 10–50 μm peptide concentrations. Vesicular samples were adjusted to pH 7.0 by phosphate buffer. All the CD experiments were carried on a Jasco 720 spectropolarimeter at ambient temperature. The spectra were recorded from 190 to 260 nm at scanning rate of 10–50 nm·min−1 with a time constant of 2 or 4 s. Each of the CD data was obtained from an average of three to four scans with step resolution of 0.05 nm and bandwidth of 1 nm. CD data are represented by the mean residue ellipticity [θ] (degree·cm2·mol−1), obtained from the observed ellipticity (θ) according to the following equation [θ] = θ·l −1· c −1·N −1where l is the cell length in mm, c is the molar concentration, and N is the number of amino acid residues in the peptide. Quantitative prediction of the secondary structure was accomplished by fitting CD data with Hennessey-Johnson algorithm (25Hennessey Jr., J.P. Johnson Jr., W.C. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 1085-1094Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar), using 33 proteins of known secondary structure as the basis set. Measurements were performed on a DLS-7000 light scattering photometer (Photal Otsuka Electronics, Osaka, Japan) with control unit LS-71 using He-Ne laser light source of 10 milliwatts at 632.8 nm. The instrument was operated with a software controlled stepping motor driven goniometer. The measurements were made at 10° interval in the scattering angle over the range of 40°-140° at room temperature. Samples were dissolved in water and filtered twice before measurements. The concentration used in the study was 1.4 mg·ml−1. Lysozyme was used as the molecular mass reference. The molecular weight of samples measured at low concentration can be obtained from the following equation, K·cRθ=1Mw·1+16π2·RG2·sin2θ23λ2Equation 2 where K is the optics constant, 2The value of refractive index increment with concentration (dn/dc) required for computation of optics constant K (K = 4π2 n 2(dn/dc)2; where n is refractive index), was measured on a double beam differential refractometer, model DRM-1021. c is the concentration, Mw is the average molecular weight,R θ is the Rayleigh ratio,R G is the radius of gyration of the molecule, θ is scattering angle, and λ is the wavelength of incident light (for review, see Ref. 26Wyatt P.J. Anal. Chim. Acta. 1993; 272: 1-40Crossref Scopus (1293) Google Scholar). The experiments were performed in a Hitachi L-6000 liquid chromatography using a Superdex-75 HR 10/30 column (Pharmacia). The peptide and protein samples of 0.4–0.8 mg·ml−1 concentrations were eluted with solution containing 22% acetonitrile and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid with a flow rate of 0.5 ml·min−1. Data were recorded at a wavelength of 214 nm. Transferrin, ovalbumin, ribonuclease A, and aprotinin were used as molecular mass markers (molecular mass: 81, 43, 13.7, and 6.5 kDa, respectively). A total of 480, including 232 nonsequential, NOE interactions and 50 intraresidue dihedral angles, were utilized in the structural computations using DG/simulated annealing protocols of Biosym programs InsightII, Discover, and NMRchitect (version 2.3) from Biosym Technologies, Inc. (San Diego, CA). In simulated annealing protocol, the temperature was raised to 1000 K and a molecular dynamics run was carried out for 8 ps to allow more conformational space to be explored. The system was subsequently annealed to 300 K in 10 steps for a total 35 ps and minimized by the steepest-descent and conjugated gradients methods before final refined structures were obtained. Sequential assignment of 1H NMR chemical shift of gp41-N51 in the SDS micellar dispersion was accomplished from the fingerprint (Fig.1 A) and NH/NH regions (Fig.1 B) to resolve overlapping cross-peaks. The 1H chemical shift assignment of the peptide in aqueous solution devoid of the detergent dispersion was made with the same strategy. The NOE interactions in these two solutions are summarized in Fig. 1,C and D (chemical shifts of 1H resonances for the peptide in SDS micellar solution and in water are tabulated in Table I). Resonance peaks of the αH of Gly1, Gly6, Gly12, and Gly16 in SDS micellar solution are split, suggesting a certain degree of structural rigidity in the NH2-terminal region of the peptide. In contrast, in water αH of glycine residues, with the exception of Gly6, give rise to degenerate chemical shifts, implying more flexible conformation for the peptide in aqueous solution. This is likely due to the fact that Gly6is in the FLG motif shown to form a type I β-turn in the fusion peptide of gp41 in aqueous solution (27Chang D.K. Chien W.J. Cheng S.F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 247: 898-905Google Scholar).Table IChemical shifts of gp41-N51 in aqueous at 278K (top) and in SDS solutions at 305 K (bottom, italic)NHαHβHOthersGly18.663.99 3.93Ala28.714.331.368.554.341.40Leu38.474.321.57γH1.538.224.191.77 1.751.51δCH30.920.860.950.87Phe48.554.663.082,6H7.227.944.473.25 3.183,5H7.277.284H7.24Leu58.414.311.54γH1.467.824.081.72 1.691.54δCH30.910.840.960.92Gly67.413.823.728.123.933.91Phe78.254.663.14 3.062,6H7.227.984.433.207.213,5H7.287.254H7.247.21Leu88.464.321.57γH1.497.993.971.73 1.611.52δCH30.920.860.86Gly97.963.878.053.91Ala108.344.321.427.854.321.46Ala118.574.311.478.234.121.32Gly128.503.978.333.98 3.90Ser138.314.553.97 3.907.984.463.98Thr148.404.414.31γCH31.237.964.324.131.26Met158.524.492.12 2.04γCH22.652.578.104.402.17 2.052.682.60ɛCH32.102.17Gly168.563.948.244.03 3.99Ala178.324.311.428.024.341.47Arg188.504.351.89 1.81γCH21.688.014.382.00 1.911.74δCH23.223.25NH7.247.18Ser198.454.433.90 3.868.194.383.95Met208.614.592.16 2.06γCH22.662.588.084.532.18 2.052.672.58ɛCH32.182.18Thr218.314.314.26γCH31.238.064.324.291.25Leu228.444.471.70γH1.678.114.361.741.66δCH30.940.890.970.90Thr238.274.344.34γCH31.278.004.394.091.33Val248.493.932.07γCH31.010.957.723.862.171.070.98Gln258.604.232.14 2.06γCH22.438.134.252.172.49δNH27.646.987.316.72Ala268.224.301.478.464.031.51NHαHβHOthersArg278.444.181.88 1.73γCH21.681.648.233.922.03 1.961.801.68δCH23.233.25NH7.327.18Gln288.314.322.05 2.00γCH22.432.387.944.112.25 2.202.522.46δNH27.647.047.426.73Leu298.294.251.74γH1.638.044.231.89 1.761.72δCH30.890.940.980.95Leu308.224.371.75γH1.658.224.121.861.63δCH30.900.91Ser318.314.413.96 3.938.154.184.04Gly328.454.007.983.99Ile338.034.121.90γCH21.531.197.784.012.051.781.29γCH30.910.98δCH30.870.92Val348.343.992.07γCH31.000.957.973.822.271.081.01Gln358.564.262.04γCH22.417.924.252.27 2.162.562.48δNH27.047.426.79Gln368.524.272.16 2.12γCH22.447.874.372.172.502.31δNH27.687.446.76Gln378.614.262.22 2.14γCH22.438.084.382.042.482.31δNH27.677.017.386.71Asn388.654.672.86γNH27.767.078.174.612.92 2.867.616.78Asn398.604.622.87γNH27.767.078.444.592.897.656.91Leu408.224.281.75γH1.678.104.171.80 1.731.58δCH30.940.900.990.93Leu418.094.271.75γH1.658.054.051.88 1.751.71δCH30.970.880.980.93Arg428.204.241.90γCH21.741.667.934.021.92 1.831.69δCH23.243.24NH7.337.18Ala438.314.281.467.864.221.58Ile448.204.011.92γCH21.621.228.093.802.031.861.18γCH30.940.94δCH30.860.87Glu458.454.202.09γCH22.378.284.042.182.642.45Ala468.324.311.467.774.281.55Gln478.184.242.11γCH22.457.734.302.28 2.112.532.42δNH27.666.997.366.69Gln488.444.262.11γCH22.457.924.242.122.452.31NHαHβHOthersδNH27.657.007.396.79His498.534.743.33 3.212H8.038.324.753.35 3.268.664H7.327.38Leu508.444.401.65γH1.628.104.341.86 1.741.63δCH30.940.890.970.90Leu518.034.231.65γH1.617.934.101.67δCH31.710.930.880.950.91 Open table in a new tab To identify the secondary structure, the chemical shifts are compared with the random coil values as compiled by Wishart and Sykes (28Wishart D.S. Sykes B.D. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 239: 363-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (936) Google Scholar), and the result is presented in Fig. 2. In water (Fig. 2 B), the helical structure can be detected in the Gln25–Leu30 stretch and is more prominent in the region COOH-terminal to Gln35. This result is in agreement with the NOE results shown in Fig. 1 D where d(i,i + 3) interactions, characteristic of helical form, are observed in these regions. In the presence of SDS micelles (Fig. 2 A), on the other hand, the regions adopting helical structure encompass Leu2–Gly12, Val24–Val34, and Asn38–Leu50. The sequence following Ile44 has the zipper 4-3 repeat pattern and thus is expected to have high propensity of forming helical structure. The NH2-terminal fusion peptide of gp41 has been shown to insert into membranous structure primarily as a helix (23Chang D.K. Cheng S.F. Chien W.J. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 6593-6602Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to the helix formation of the NH2-terminal fusion peptide in SDS solution, enhancement of the helical form in the micellar medium is also observed for the region Gln25–Ser31and the region following Gln35. This is evident from the larger chemical shift deviation of αH and βH from the random values in SDS solution than those obtained in water as shown in Fig. 2. The present data for gp41-N51 thus corroborate with the idea that helix is induced in the micellar environment. The CD results displayed in Fig.3 are consistent with the NMR data in that the helical content for the peptide is significantly increased upon association with SDS micelle. The helical structure is also enhanced in both PS and PC vesicular solutions. From the CD data, the secondary structural element analyzed by the algorithm of Hennessey and Johnson (25Hennessey Jr., J.P. Johnson Jr., W.C. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 1085-1094Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar) for gp41-N51 is summarized in TableII. The result clearly indicates an increase in the helix population in the membrane-mimic environment, especially in dispersions that carry negatively charged headgroups.Table IISecondary structure analysis from CD data of gp41-N51 in aqueous, SDS, and lipidic solutions (in %)SolutionHelixAntiparallel β-sheetParallel β-sheetTurnOthersH2O10 ± 219 ± 25 ± 130 ± 136 ± 1SDS51 ± 11 ± 13 ± 023 ± 122 ± 0PS:PC = 75:2560 ± 29 ± 18 ± 14 ± 119 ± 1PS:PC = 25:7526 ± 345 ± 82 ± 32 ± 225 ± 9Data were obtained from CD spectra shown in Fig. 3. Open table in a new tab Data were obtained from CD spectra shown in Fig. 3. The results of light scattering measurements on gp41-N51 and lysozyme are presented in Fig.4. The intercept for gp41-N51 is 5.71 × 10−5, which yields a particle mass of 17.5 kDa. The value is approximately three times the monomeric mass of 5.4 kDa for gp41-N51. The molecular weight determined by light scattering experiments is a weight-averaged value, hence the data indicate that the peptide molecules are predominantly trimeric or they are in an equilibrium between dimers and tetramers. The error estimated from the difference between the experimental and reported values of lysozyme is 9%. The gel filtration data on gp41-N51 displayed in Fig.5 A may arise from dimerization of the peptide. Oligomerization of the NH2-terminal peptide of gp41 is also demonstrated by diffusion coefficient measurements from NMR pulsed field gradient experiments shown in Fig. 5 B. TheD s of the peptide is slightly larger than that of lysozyme with a molecular mass of 14.4 kDa. Thus, as in the light scattering experiments, diffusion coefficient measurements indicate that the peptide molecules exist in the aqueous solution as trimers, or there is equilibrium between dimers and tetramers for the peptide. It is of interest to observe that a particle mass of about 15 kDa is obtained for the peptide in the concentration on the order of 1 mg·ml−1 for light scattering and NMR experiments, while smaller size is detected at lower concentration employed in gel filtration experiment. The oligomerization of the NH2-terminal peptide of shorter length encompassing 33 amino acids has also been reported by Kliger et al.(29Kliger Y. Aharoni A. Rapaport D. Jones P. Blumenthal R. Shai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13496-13505Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). The three-dimensional structure of gp41-N51 in the presence of SDS micelles was calculated by employing the constraints derived from NOE data and hydrogen bonds suggested by the deuteron-hydrogen exchange experiments. Fig.6 A displays a typical computed structure and the superposition of 10 structures excluding residues between Ala10 and Val24. As expected, the helical form can be observed in the NH2-terminal region up to Ala11, and the segments Leu22–Val34 and Asn38–Leu50. The sequence between Ala11 and Val24 exhibits substantial flexibility as indicated by Fig. 6 B, which shows larger root mean square deviation values of backbone atoms for these residues than residues in the remainder of the peptide as analyzed from the 10 conformers used in Fig. 6 A. This flexible region overlaps with the gp120-associating site implicated in the mutagenesis studies (1Hernandez L.D. Hoffman L.R. Wolfsberg T.G. White J.M. Annu. Rev. Cell. Dev. Biol. 1996; 12: 627-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar). The root mean square deviation values of atomic fluctuation for Asn38 is substantially larger than those of the adjacent residues. In addition, a 310 helix is found for the Gln35–Gln37 stretch (Φ(35) = −71 ± 9°, Ψ(35) = −30 ± 7°, Φ(36) = −82 ± 11°, Ψ(36) = −37 ± 14°, and Φ(37) = −79 ± 22°, Ψ(37) = −35 ± 13°), which is readily transformed into α-helix. The structures are thus convergent except for the segment spanning Ala11–Leu22. Aside from both ends of gp41-N51 that are subject to the fraying effect, the larger fluctuation is seen for the Ala11–Leu22 region. The result concurs with the idea that the Ala11–Gly12 dipeptide is localized at the micellar-aqueous boundary, as noted previously (23Chang D.K. Cheng S.F. Chien W.J. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 6593-6602Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and determines the depth of penetration for the fusion peptide into the micelle. As will be discussed in the next section, the flexibility of this segment may have implication in the fusogenic activity of the NH2-terminal portion of gp41. Our CD data in water, the micellar and vesicular solutions for both the 23-amino acid fusion peptide sequence of gp41 in a previous report (23Chang D.K. Cheng S.F. Chien W.J. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 6593-6602Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and a longer gp41-N51 peptide indicate that, in the membranous environment, the helix form is induced at the expense of β-form or random coil for the NH2-terminal hydrophobic stretch of gp41. As shown previously (23Chang D.K. Cheng S.F. Chien W.J. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 6593-6602Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), these data suggest that the fusion peptide penetrates into the membrane primarily as a helix. In the present study, conformational adaptability of gp41-N51 on the amino acid level exhibited in the presence and absence of membrane-mimic environment is provided by NMR data. However, conformation of the more polar sequence following the fusion peptide, Ala12–Leu22, was found more flexible from structural analysis of NMR data (Fig. 6). This conclusion is also consistent with scarcity of NOE cross-peaks involving protons in the residues of Ala12–Leu22 segment, likely due to the smaller motional correlation times and/or more disordered structure, both of which are compatible with the idea of a flexible region. Because the segment was found to be essential for association with gp120 (2Cao J. Bergeron L. Helseth E. Thali M. Repke H. Sodroski J. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 2747-2755Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 30Kowalski M. Potz J. Basiripour L. Dorfman T. Goh W.C. Terwilliger E. Dayton A. Rosen C. Haseltine W. Sodroski J. Science. 1987; 237: 1351-1355Crossref PubMed Scopus (611) Google Scholar), the flexibility of this region in the membranous medium suggests that it plays a role in the conformational change during the native-to-fusogenic transformation of gp41, which is likely triggered by the dissociation of gp120 from gp41 upon binding to CD4 and the secondary receptor (for example, CCR5 or CXCR4). As indicated in Figs. 2, A and B, the FLG motif (Phe4-Gly6) undergoes a β to α transition as the peptide interacts with the SDS micelle. Moreover, the motif has been shown to serve as an initiation site for helix formation (27Chang D.K. Chien W.J. Cheng S.F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 247: 898-905Google Scholar). Together with insertion into the micelle of the NH2-terminal Gly1–Ala10 region, as suggested by the spin label attenuation data (23Chang D.K. Cheng S.F. Chien W.J. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 6593-"

One of the targets for this modulator effect is the AP-1 binding site within the c-junand collagenase promoters. The physical interactions between RB and c-Jun were demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation of these two proteins using anti-c-Jun or anti-RB antisera, glutathioneS-transferase affinity matrix binding assays in vitro, and electrophoretic mobility shift assays. The C-terminal site of the leucine zipper of c-Jun mediated the interaction with RB. Although the B-pocket domain of RB alone bound to c-Jun, a second c-Jun binding site in the RB was also suggested. Mammalian two-hybrid-based assay provided corroborative evidence that transactivation of gene expression by RB required the C-terminal region of c-Jun. We conclude that RB enhances transcription activity mediated through the AP-1 binding site. Adenovirus E1A or human papillomavirus E7 inhibits RB-mediated transcription activity.

Although the biochemical mechanisms of RB function remain unclear, one possibility is that it exerts transcriptional regulation (4Sellers W.R. Kaelin W.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1288: M1-M5PubMed Google Scholar). Indeed, several transcription factors have been identified as targets of modulation by RB, which may be directly involved in modification of chromatin structure and results in regulation of a set of genes (5Chellappan S.P.

Transcription regulation is a control mechanism that is critical for fundamental biological processes, such as cell growth and differentiation. Proteins involved in transcriptional control either bind specific DNA sequences or act as co-activators or adapters forming a complex with the transcription factor. These transcription factors and co-activators are often targeted by viral oncoproteins during oncogenic transformation of cells. For instance, the ability of adenovirus E1A to transform cells is closely associated with its ability to interact with RB. The ability of E1A to transactivate E2F-mediated transcription maps to the conserved regions 1 and 2 (CR1 and CR2) of E1A, both of which are involved in RB binding (11Bagchi S. Raychaudhuri P. Nevins J.R. Cell. 1990; 62: 659-669Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). It has also been reported that E1A represses AP-1 activity (12Offringa R. Gebel S. van Dam H. Timmers M. Smits A. Zwart R. Stein B. Bos J.L. van der Eb A. Herrlich P. Cell. 1990; 62: 527-538Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) and that the ability of E1A to down-regulate AP-1 activity is dependent on CR1. Similarly, the transforming and immortalizing activities of human papillomavirus (HPV) E7 have been mainly attributed to the ability of E7 that binds to RB and related proteins such as p107 and p130 (13Dyson N. Howley P.M. Munger K. Harlow E. Science. 1989; 243: 934-937Crossref PubMed Scopus (2395) Google Scholar,14Dyson N. Guida P. Munger K. Harlow E. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 6893-6902Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The binding regions of E7 are homologous to the adenovirus E1A and simian virus 40 large antigen RB binding domains (13Dyson N. Howley P.M. Munger K. Harlow E. Science. 1989; 243: 934-937Crossref PubMed Scopus (2395) Google Scholar, 15DeCaprio J.A. Ludlow J.W. Figge J. Shew J.-Y. Huang C.-M. Lee W.-H. Marsillo E. Paucha E.

Nature. 1988; 334: 124-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (1038) Google Scholar). These regions of homology include CR1 and CR2, which are present in both the 12 S and 13 S forms of E1A (17Phelps W.C. Yee C.L. Munger K. Howley P.M. Cell. 1988; 53: 539-547Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar). Many studies have shown that the HPVs associated with malignant lesions readily cause transformation in vitro. Although the E7 gene alone was sufficient for the transformation of established rodent cell lines and to exhibit anchorage-independent growth (18Yasumoto S. Burkhardt A.L. Doniger J. DiPaolo J.A. J. Virol. 1986; 57: 572-577Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), cooperation with an activated ras oncogene was required for the immortalization and transformation of primary rat cells (19Chesters P.M. Vousden K.H. Edmonds C. McCance D.J. J. Gen. Virol. 1990; 71: 449-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Mutations at positions 24 and 26 of E7 inhibited binding of RB and transformation of NIH 3T3 cells and rat embryonic fibroblasts (19Chesters P.M. Vousden K.H. Edmonds C. McCance D.J. J. Gen. Virol. 1990; 71: 449-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 20Edmonds C. Vousden K.H. J. Virology. 1989; 63: 2650-2656Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The nuclear proto-oncogene c-jun was originally defined as a cellular homologue of a transforming gene of an avian sarcoma virus 17 (21Bohmann D. Bos T.J. Admon A. Nishimura T. Vogt P.K. Tjian R. Science. 1987; 238: 1386-1392Crossref PubMed Scopus (953) Google Scholar, 22Maki Y. Bos T.J. Davis C. Starbuck M. Vogt P.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The products of the c-jun gene form homodimeric or heterodimeric complexes with the products of the fos orfra gene family to regulate transcription of target genes by binding to a specific DNA sequence in the promoter region (24Chiu R. Boyle W.J. Meek J. Smeal T. Hunter T. Karin M. Cell. 1988; 54: 541-552Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1009) Google Scholar, 25Rauscher III, F.J. Voulalas P.J. Franza B.R. Curran T.

EMBO J. 1989; 8: 805-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). In addition to the transcription regulation, c-jun also has a functional role in cellular proliferation, differentiation, and transformation (reviewed in Ref. 28Angel P. Karin M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1072: 129-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (3259) Google Scholar). The RB protein localizes in the nucleus and represses the expression of the c-fos gene (29Robbins P.D. Horowitz J.M. Mulligan R.C. Nature. 1990; 346: 668-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar), the gene product of which, Fos, is one component of the heterodimeric transcription factor AP-1 (24Chiu R. Boyle W.J. Meek J. Smeal T. Hunter T. Karin M. Cell. 1988; 54: 541-552Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1009) Google Scholar, 25Rauscher III, F.J. Voulalas P.J. Franza B.R. Curran T. Genes Dev. 1988; 2: 1687-1699Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is possible that RB can be functionally linked to c-jun and thus play a role in transcriptional control. Constitutive activation of the nuclear proto-oncogene c-junleads to increased transcription of a set of genes that generate malignant phenotypes in some cells (30Schütte J. Minna J.D. Birrer M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 2257-2261Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar), whereas inactivation of theRb gene causes many human cancers (31Harbour J.W. Lai S.L. Whang-Peng J. Gazdar A.F. Minna J.D. Kaye F.J. Science. 1988; 241: 353-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (743) Google Scholar, 32Hensel C.H. Hsieh C.L. Gazdar A.F. Johnson B.E. Sakaguchi A.Y. Naylor S.L. Lee W.H. Lee E.Y. Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 3067-3072PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, these two classes of genes have also been demonstrated to involve in cell differentiation (3Chen P.L. Riley D.J. Chen Y. Lee W.-H. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2794-2804Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar, 33Yang-Yen H.F. Chiu R. Karin M. New Biol. 1990; 2: 351-361PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study, we demonstrate that transient expression of human RB significantly stimulated the expression of the human c-jun and collagenase promoter in murine fibroblast, 3T6, and NIH 3T3 cells. Deletion and mutagenesis analysis reveals that RB transactivates gene expression mediated through the AP-1 binding site. In addition, we demonstrate a direct physical interaction between c-Jun and RB by using co-immunoprecipitation, GST-affinity matrix binding assays, and electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs). The interaction domains are mapped to the C-terminal region of c-Jun and the B-pocket of RB. Transactivation of c-jun expression by RB is inhibited by the expression of adenovirus E1A or HPV E7, suggesting that the RB-c-Jun complex may involved in controlling cell growth and differentiation. Cells were cultured as follows: NIH 3T3 cells in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) with 10% calf serum, 3T6 mouse fibroblasts and CV-1 cells (green monkey kidney cell line) in DMEM with 10% fetal bovine serum, Molt4 human acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells in RPMI 1640 medium plus 10% fetal bovine serum, and F9 cells in F-12/DMEM with 10% fetal bovine serum. Cells were grown in a humidified incubator at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 6% CO2. All cell lines were transfected by the Ca3(PO4)2 DNA coprecipitation method. Cells were harvested 48 h after transfection, and CAT activities were measured by percentage of acetylation. For standardization, equal amounts of protein were used in each reaction. Transfection efficiency was normalized according to the level of β-galactosidase expression in cells co-transfected with RSV-βgal plasmid. E1AΔ51–116 (deletion mutant in CR1 transforming domain) and E1Am928 (missense mutation in CR2 region) have been described previously (34Kitabayashi I. Eckner R. Arany Z. Chiu R. Gachelin G.

EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3496-3509Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). c-Jun (1–311), c-Jun (1–244), and c-Jun (1–221) proteins were in vitrotranslated using pGEM4Zc-jun as a template digested withBspHI, BstXI, or PstI, respectively. c-Jun331m14, c-Jun331m9, and c-Jun331m15 were in vitrotranslated from pGem4Zm14, pGem4Zm9, and pGem4Zm15 (35Smeal T. Angel P. Meek J. Karin M. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 2091-2100Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar), respectively. c-Jun (1–281) protein was in vitro translated from pGEM-c-jun281, which was prepared by cloning a PCR-amplified fragment (1–281) into a pGEM4Z vector at the HindIII and BamHI sites. Primers 5′-CCCAAGCTTATGACTGCAAAGATGGAAACGACCTTC-3′ and 5′-CGCGGATCCTCACTCCAGCCGGGCGATTCTCTCCAG-3′ were used for PCR amplification with pGEM4Zc-jun (1–331) as a template. GST-RB (379–928), GST-RB (379–792), GST-RB (379–928, Δexon 21), and GST-RB (379–928, Δexon 22) were described previously (36Kaelin W.G. Pallas D.C. DeCaprio J.A. Kaye F.J. Livingston D.M. Cell. 1991; 64: 521-532Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). GST-RB (251–928, Δ622–714) was prepared by cloning a PCR-amplified fragment from an RB mutant (obtained from E. Harlow) into pGEX 4T-1 vector at the BamHI and XhoI sites. GST-RB (638–792) was prepared by cloning a PCR-amplified fragment with 5′-CGCGGATCCACCCAGAAGCCATTGAAATCTACC-3′ and 5′-CCGCTCGAGTCAAAA-CTTGTAAGGGCTTCGAGGAATG-3′ as primers and GST-RB (379–928) as a template. Similarly, GST-RB (379–572) was cloned into pGEX 4T-1 vector at the BamHI and XhoI sites. For constructing GST-RB (251–928, Δ379–572 and Δ622–714), two PCR fragments were initially synthesized using plasmid pGST-RB (251–928, Δ622–714) as the template. The primers 5′-CGCGGATCCCGAACACCCAGGCGAGGTCAGAACAGG-3′ and 5′-CCCAAGCTTCATAACAGTCCTAACTGGAGTGTGTGG-3′ amplified RB amino acids 251–380; primers 5′-CCCAAGCTTATTAAACAATCAAAGGACCGAGAAGGACC-3′ and 5′-CCGCTCGAG-TCATTTCTCTTCCTTGTTTGAGGTATC-3′ amplified amino acids 572–928, with amino acids 622–714 deleted. The amplified fragments were ligated in-frame at the HindIII site before cloning into the BamHI-XhoI site in pGEX4T-1. A 1.9-kilobase-pair fragment (c-Jun 1–331) was PCR-amplified from pGEM4Zc-jun using primers 5′-CCGGAATTCATGACTGCAAAGATGG-AAACGACC-3′ and 5′-CGCGGATCCTCAAAATGTTGCAACTGCTGCGTTAG-3′. The PCR-amplified fragment was fused to GAL4 (1–147) and then cloned into the HindIII site of the mammalian expression vector, pRc/CMV (Invitrogen). A c-Jun frameshift-mutant was generated by PCR amplification using RSVmc-jun as a template. The amplified fragment containing C-terminal amino acid residues 194–331 was fused to GAL4 (1–147) for a negative control fusion plasmid, GALDB-Cmc-Jun. Expression vector containing GAL4 (1–147) fused to N-terminal c-Jun (1–223) was obtained from M. Karin. RB (301–928) was PCR-amplified from phRB, using primers 5′-CGGGATCCCGAATTCTCTTGGACTTGTAAC-3′ and 5′-CGGGATCCAAGC-TTGCAAGGTCCTGAGATCCTC-3′. The PCR product was cloned into pGAD424 (CLONTECH) at theBamHI site to create a translational fusion with GAL4 (768–881) before inserting into the HindIII site of pRc/CMV. Cellular proteins were biosynthetically labeled for 3 h by the addition ofl-[35S]methionine (500 μCi/ml, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) to subconfluent cell layers in methionine-free DMEM (CV-1) or RPMI 1640 medium (Molt 4) with 2% dialyzed fetal bovine serum. Labeled cells were lysed in 1.0 ml of ice-cold radioimmune precipitation buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.2% Nonidet P-40, 0.2% SDS, 0.2% deoxycholate, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) with 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, and 1 μg/ml aprotinin. Lysates were incubated overnight with specific monoclonal or polyclonal antibodies. The antigen-antibody complexes were incubated with a mixture of protein A- and protein G-Sepharose at 4 °C for 2 h, washed five times with 1 ml of lysis buffer, followed by boiling in SDS-buffer to dissociate the complexes. Dissociated complexes were diluted with cold radioimmune precipitation buffer, re-immunoprecipitated with specific antiserum, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Gels were dried and exposed to x-ray film at −70 °C. GST-RB fusion proteins were immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads equilibrated with NETN buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and 1 mmdithiothreitol). In vitro translated, [35S]methionine-labeled c-Jun and its various mutant proteins were prepared using TNT T7 Quick Coupled Transcription/Translation kit (Promega). The translated proteins were incubated with GST-RB (379–792) or GST-2T-Sepharose beads in NETN buffer containing 0.5 μg BSA for 1 h. The beads were washed three times with NETN buffer, boiled in SDS-PAGE loading buffer for 3 min, and then resolved by 12.5% SDS-PAGE. Gels were fixed, dried, and exposed to x-ray film. Immunocomplexes precipitated by anti-RB antibody (PMG3–245, PharMingen; IF-8 and C-15, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or preimmune serum were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Membranes were probed with anti-c-Jun antibody, followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulin G. Immunoreactive bands were detected by ECL developing reagents (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Complimentary oligonucleotides containing TGACATCA sequences of human c-Jun/AP-1 binding site were annealed and labeled as described previously (37Chen L.I. Nishinaka T. Kwan K. Kitabayashi I. Yokoyama K. Fu Y.H. Grunwald S. Chiu R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4380-4389Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). EMSAs were performed in a binding buffer (12 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 5 mm MgCl2, 4 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 60 mm KCl, 0.6 mm Na2EDTA, pH 8.0, 0.6 mmdithiothreitol, 12% glycerol) consisting of 2 μg of poly(dI-dC)-(dI-dC) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and 6 μg of acetylated bovine serum albumin in a total volume of 20 μl. GST-RB fusion protein was expressed using the Baculovirus expression vector system and purified by a GSH-Sepharose 4B matrix. c-Jun was bacterially expressed using the pET expression system. When required, antibodies were preincubated with purified GST-RB fusion protein for 1 h at 4 °C before the addition of c-Jun lysate. Incubation was continued for 15 min at room temperature, at which time 20,000 cpm of labeled AP-1 binding probe was added, and the reaction was continued for another 15 min at room temperature. For competition experiments, a 50-fold molar excess of double-stranded AP-1 oligonucleotide was preincubated with c-Jun for 15 min at room temperature before the addition of the probe. The bound complexes were resolved on a 4% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels with 2.5% glycerol under low ionic conditions (0.25X TBE). Gels were then fixed, dried, and exposed to x-ray film with an intensifying screen at –80 °C. RB represses the expression of the c-fos gene (29Robbins P.D. Horowitz J.M. Mulligan R.C. Nature. 1990; 346: 668-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar), the gene product of which, Fos, is one component of the heterodimeric transcription factor AP-1 (24Chiu R. Boyle W.J. Meek J. Smeal T. Hunter T. Karin M. Cell. 1988; 54: 541-552Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1009) Google Scholar, 25Rauscher III, F.J. Voulalas P.J. Franza B.R. Curran T. Genes Dev. 1988; 2: 1687-1699Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). To test the hypothesis that RB may regulate the expression of c-jun through the AP-1 binding site, we demonstrated that RB stimulated c-jun expression by approximately 10–15-fold in the NIH 3T3 cells and that this stimulation required an intact AP-1 binding site (Fig. 1 A). Similar results were also observed in the murine fibroblast cell line 3T6 (Fig. 1 A). Analogous experiments with the collagenase promoter, containing or lacking an AP-1 site, also demonstrated that RB induced transcription is mediated through the AP-1 site (Fig.1 A). Stable transfectants carrying collagenase promoter −73/+63 or −60/+63 fused to chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter gene also demonstrated that RB enhances gene expression required AP-1 site (Fig. 1 B). Furthermore, to examine whether RB actually regulates the endogenous c-jun gene expression, we performed Northern blot analysis to compare c-jun expression in SAOS2 cells ectopically expressed Rb gene with that in wild-type SAOS2 cells. As shown in Fig.1 C, expression of Rb in SAOS2 cells enhances the endogenous c-jun expression about 1.8-fold after standarization with glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase as an internal control. To investigate whether AP-1-mediated transactivation by RB requires a direct physical association between the RB and c-Jun proteins, we immunoprecipitated TPA-stimulated [35S]methionine-labeled Molt 4 cell lysates with either anti-c-Jun polyclonal antibody or anti-RB monoclonal antibody (PMG3–245, PharMingen). Under nondenaturing conditions, RB coprecipitated with c-Jun in immunoprecipitates prepared with anti-c-Jun antibody (Fig.2 A, lane 2). One-third of the immunocomplex above was then solubilized and re-immunoprecipitated with rabbit preimmune sera, anti-c-Jun, or anti-RB antibody. Immunoprecipitation with anti-c-Jun antibody revealed a 39-kDa c-Jun protein; RB monoclonal antibody immunoprecipitated RB protein and its degraded products (Fig. 2 A, lanes 5 and 6). Similar results were also obtained from CV-1 cells, although the amount of coprecipitated RB with c-Jun was less than that prepared from Molt 4 cells (Fig. 2 B, lane 1). This observation could be due to differences in the availability of RB in the cells (38Nishinaka T. Fu Y.H. Chen L.I. Yokoyama K. Chiu R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1351: 274-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). In contrast, the anti-RB monoclonal antibody did not coprecipitate c-Jun with RB (Fig. 2 A, lane 3). To confirm the interaction between RB and c-Jun in Molt 4 cells, c-junexpression plasmid was transfected into Molt 4 cells to enhance the capacity of interaction. We detected c-Jun with anti-c-Jun antibody by Western blot in these cell lysates originally precipitated by anti-RB antibody (Fig. 2 C, lanes 1 and 2) but not by antibody raised against the C-terminal RB amino acid residues 914–928 (Fig. 2 C, lane 3). These results clearly demonstrated that c-Jun physically associates with RB in vivo. To investigate whether RB-c-Jun complex binds to the AP-1 site, we performed EMSAs using labeled human c-jun TRE oligonucleotide containing the AP-1 binding sequence, TGACATCA. Bacterial expressed recombinant c-Jun and baculovirus-expressed GST-RB were used for EMSA. In the presence of bacterially expressed c-Jun lysates, a single binding complex with TRE probe was observed (Fig.3, lane 3). A supershift in mobility (Fig. 3, lane 1) and a dramatically decreased binding activity (Fig. 3, lane 2) were observed in the presence of anti-c-Jun antibody and in an addition of 50-fold molar excess of cold double-stranded TRE competitor, respectively. These data suggest that c-Jun-DNA binding is specific. Purified GST-RB fusion protein quantitatively enhanced c-Jun-binding activity (Fig. 3, comparelane 3 to lanes 4–6). This enhanced binding activity can be blocked by preincubation with anti-RB antibody (Fig. 3,lane 7). The interaction with anti-RB antibody is specific because an unrelated antibody against serum-responsive factor had no effect in the presence of c-Jun or in conjunction with GST-RB (Fig. 3,lanes 8 and 9). These data further demonstrated that RB is involved in the c-Jun DNA-binding activity. A direct physical association between RB and c-Jun was further investigated by incubating [35S]methionine-labeled c-Jun with GST-RB-Sepharose beads and analyzing the bound protein by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 4 A, lane 1). To localize the region of c-Jun important for direct interaction with RB, [35S]methionine-labeled mutant derivatives with sequential deletion from the C-terminal portion of c-Jun were analyzed by GST affinity matrix-based assays for their abilities to interact with RB. Deletion mutant c-Jun311 (1–311) still interacted with GST-RB (Fig. 4 A, lane 4), although the binding declined steadily with further truncation of c-Jun to amino acid 281 (Fig.4 A, lane 7). Further deletions beyond amino acid 281 totally abolished binding (Fig. 4 A, lanes 10and 13), suggesting that the C-terminal region of c-Jun is important for interaction with RB. Binding studies with leucine zipper mutants, c-Jun331m9 (mutation at amino acid residues 286 and 294) and c-Jun331m14 (mutation at amino acid residues 286, 287, and 294) (35Smeal T. Angel P. Meek J. Karin M. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 2091-2100Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar), that contain mutations in the second and third leucines required for c-Jun homodimerization still retained binding to RB (Fig.4 A, lanes 16 and 19). However, the mutant c-Jun331m15 (mutation at amino acid residues 287 and 308) failed to bind to RB (Fig. 4 A, lane 22). Thus, the region of c-Jun required to interact with RB appears to be the C-terminal portion of c-Jun containing part of the leucine zipper motif (Fig. 4 B). To localize the domain(s) of RB required for interaction with c-Jun, GST-RB (379–928) and its various mutants were analyzed for binding with in vitro translated c-Jun (1–331). As shown in Fig.5 A (see schematic representation in Fig. 5 B), in vitro translated c-Jun bound to the discrete B-pocket domain but not the A-pocket domain of RB (Fig. 5 A, lanes 11 and 12). c-Jun also bound RB with internal deletions in the B-pocket domain, Δ622–714, Δexon 21 (Δ703–737), and Δexon 22 (Δ738–775) (Fig.5 A, lanes 3–5), suggesting that c-Jun can bind to another site within amino acids 379–928 of RB. To determine whether a highly homologous A-pocket region can complement the partially deleted B-pocket mutants, we constructed a double deletion mutant, GST-RB 251–928 (Δ379–573 and Δ622–714), with deletions of the entire A-pocket and portions of the B-pocket for binding assays. We observed that c-Jun bound the double deletion mutant, but at a significantly reduced level (Fig. 5 A, lanes 9 and10 compared with lanes 2 and 3). This result suggested that although the A-pocket domain failed to bind c-Jun as a discrete element, its presence could complement the partially deleted B-pocket domain. A similar observation was reported with p300, which requires two separate regions to interact with c-Jun (39Lee J.-S. See R.H. Deng T. Shi Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4312-4326Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Finally, we examined the RB-c-Jun interaction in NIH 3T3 cells by the two-hybrid-based assay (see schematic diagram in Fig.6 C). We observed a dose-dependent transactivation by RB in the presence of full-length c-Jun, but not with N-terminal c-Jun (Nc-Jun) or the frameshift-mutated C-terminal c-Jun (Cmc-Jun) (see schematic representation of constructs in Fig. 6 A), suggesting that RB requires the C-terminal region of c-Jun to enhance transcriptional activity (Fig. 6 B). However, we also observed a decrease in CAT activity with increased RB concentration beyond 4 μg in our experiment with a 5X Gal4 binding site reporter, pG5E4·CAT (Fig. 6 B). Nevertheless, the levels of Gal4-RB proteins expressed in the transfected cells showed a dose-dependent linear increase in this range, using Western blot probed with anti-Gal4 antibody (Fig. 6 B). The data presented in Fig. 6 B are consistent with the in vitro binding data, which implicated the C-terminal region of c-Jun in mediating interaction with the RB. Interaction between these two proteins may be responsible for the observed stimulation of gene expression by RB. E1A-RB complex has been implicated in controlling cell growth (16Whyte P. Buchkovich K.J. Horowitz J.M. Friend S.H. Raybuck M. Weinberg R.A. Harlow E. Nature. 1988; 334: 124-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (1038) Google Scholar). To test whether E1A affected the ability of RB to stimulate transcription through the AP-1 site, cotransfection of E1A and RB expression plasmids with –73col·CAT was performed. The wild-type E1A, but not the transforming domain CR1 deletion mutant, E1AΔ51–116, abrogated RB-stimulated gene expression (Fig.7 A). This result agrees with the previous report that E1A inhibits gene expression mediated by the AP-1 binding site (12Offringa R. Gebel S. van Dam H. Timmers M. Smits A. Zwart R. Stein B. Bos J.L. van der Eb A. Herrlich P. Cell. 1990; 62: 527-538Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Similarly, RB-mediated regulation of the collagenase promoter was also inhibited by the expression of another RB-binding protein, HPV E7, but not by its mutants E7m24 or E7m91 (20Edmonds C. Vousden K.H. J. Virology. 1989; 63: 2650-2656Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 7 B). Mutations in E7m24 and E7m91 are located in the regions important for the transforming function of the E7 protein (20Edmonds C. Vousden K.H. J. Virology. 1989; 63: 2650-2656Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These results suggested that the formation of E1A-RB or E7-RB complex can reduce the transcriptional activity of c-Jun protein and thereby disrupt the activation of c-Jun-regulated genes normally subjected to positive regulation by RB. When we initiated this study, our first data showed that the transient expression of RB transactivates –1.1 kilobase/+740c-Jun·CAT activity (data not shown). To map the RB-responsive element, we used several c-jun promoter deletion mutants, including –132 c-jun and –79c-jun, fused to CAT reporter gene. We consistently observed that RB transactivates c-jun·CAT activity and suggested that transactivation was mediated through the AP-1 site. In addition, we further tested AP-1-mediated transactivation by RB using –73col·CAT containing a single AP-1 site and –60col·CAT lacking AP-1 site as a reporter. The results consistently showed that RB transactivation is dependent upon the presence of an AP-1 site. Furthermore, we also demonstrated that RB actually enhances the endogenous c-jun gene expression in SAOS2 cells. The discrepancy between our data and a previous report by Robbinset al. (29Robbins P.D. Horowitz J.M. Mulligan R.C. Nature. 1990; 346: 668-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar) that could be due to the use of different constructs (5X versus 1X AP-1 site) and different promoters. Nevertheless, both AP-1 site-mediated transactivation and transrepression have been reported previously (reviewed in Ref. 26Cohen D.R. Ferreira P.C.P. Gentz R. Franza B.R. Curran T. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 173-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Differential modulation could depend upon the promoter or the cell type. To further confirm our data, we used two-hybrid-based assay with 5X GAL4 binding site as the reporter to simulate the 5X AP-1 reporter as used by Robbins et al. (29Robbins P.D. Horowitz J.M. Mulligan R.C. Nature. 1990; 346: 668-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). We observed dose-dependent transactivation by RB as shown in Fig.6 B. These results suggested that the concentration of RB might dictate transcriptional repression or activation. At higher concentrations, RB possibly recruits other RB binding cellular factors equivalent to E1A or E7 proteins, resulting in transrepression instead of transactivation. Similar results were observed with JunB repression of gene expression mediated through a single AP-1 binding site. This repression was converted to transactivation when 3X AP-1 site was used as a reporter (40Chiu R. Angel P. Karin M. Cell. 1989; 59: 979-986Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar). We have demonstrated that RB enhanced c-Jun DNA-binding activityin vitro by EMSAs (Fig. 3). In addition, we have demonstrated the C-terminal region of c-Jun containing part of the leucine zipper was involved in the interaction with RB. These data suggest that the hydrophilic part but not the hydrophobic part of the amphipathic helix of c-Jun is involved in the interaction with RB. Although RB also interacts with c-Fos (41Nead M.A. Baglia L.A. Antinore M.J. Ludlow J.W. McCance D.J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2342-2352Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), we did not observe either enhanced or reduced binding activity between RB and c-Jun when recombinant c-Fos was included in the reaction mixtures (data not shown). RB could interact with different members of the AP-1 family, resulting in a different effect on AP-1 activity or its specificity. We also systematically analyzed different regions of RB that may be involved in the interaction of RB with c-Jun. The results revealed that both the A- and B-pockets in RB can complement each other, although the B-pocket alone can interact with c-Jun in vitro. A similar observation has also been reported with p300, which requires two separate regions to interact with c-Jun (39Lee J.-S. See R.H. Deng T. Shi Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4312-4326Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). It has also been demonstrated that neither the A- nor the B-pocket of RB has any E2F repressor activity (42Chow K.N.B. Dean D.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4862-4868Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). However, A- and B-pockets coexpressed on separate proteins regained transcriptional repressor activity (42Chow K.N.B. Dean D.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4862-4868Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), suggesting that these two pocket domains interact to form a functional repressor. Previous reports suggested that RB transactivates gene expression through the SP-1 site (37Chen L.I. Nishinaka T. Kwan K. Kitabayashi I. Yokoyama K. Fu Y.H. Grunwald S. Chiu R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4380-4389Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 43Kim S.J. Onwuta U.S. Lee Y.I. Li R. Botchan M.R. Robbins P.D. Mol. Cell.

A. 1991; 88: 10227-10231Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The mechanism for this transactivation remains unclear, although the accessory factor(s) that required for this transactivation has been suggested (37Chen L.I. Nishinaka T. Kwan K. Kitabayashi I. Yokoyama K. Fu Y.H. Grunwald S. Chiu R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4380-4389Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Our present studies showed that RB-mediated transactivation also maps to the AP-1 site by the mechanism of direct interaction between RB and c-Jun proteins. We here provide direct evidence demonstrating the role of RB as a coactivator of c-Jun in vivo. Similarly, p300, another E1A-binding protein, also functions as a coactivator of CREB and c-Jun (39Lee J.-S. See R.H. Deng T. Shi Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4312-4326Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 45Arany Z. Sellers R. Livingston D.M. Eckner R. Cell. 1994; 77: 799-800Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). Is RB-c-Jun complex essentially required for cell growth control? Our data do not directly address this question. However, it has been reported that adenovirus E1A represses transcription of the collagenase gene via the phorbol ester-responsive element (12Offringa R. Gebel S. van Dam H. Timmers M. Smits A. Zwart R. Stein B. Bos J.L. van der Eb A. Herrlich P. Cell. 1990; 62: 527-538Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The mechanism of repression has not yet been identified. Here, we offer a possible mechanism that E1A inhibits AP-1-mediated transcription by targeting c-Jun coactivator RB (Fig. 7 A). Furthermore, this RB-mediated transactivation is inhibited by the expression of adenovirus E1A but not by the CR1 transforming domain deletion mutant, implying that AP-1-mediated transactivation by RB is important for cell growth control, as suggested by Nead et al. (41Nead M.A. Baglia L.A. Antinore M.J. Ludlow J.W. McCance D.J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2342-2352Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). RB−/− cells would explore the physiological role of RB-c-Jun complex in cell growth control. Induction of c-Jun, c-Fos, and JunB has been reported during keratinocyte differentiation (46Welter J.F. Eckert R.L. Oncogen. 1995; 11: 2681-2687PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that c-Jun/AP-1-mediated transactivation by RB is important for cell differentiation. Therefore, inhibition of keratinocyte differentiation by E7 protein may be mediated by the repression of c-Jun via targeting its coactivator RB (Fig. 7 B). These results agree with report by Nead et al. (41Nead M.A. Baglia L.A. Antinore M.J. Ludlow J.W. McCance D.J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2342-2352Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) that RB is a potential modulator of c-jun expression during keratinocyte differentiation. Therefore, the functional interplay between RB and c-Jun might well represent an important mechanism for controlling transcription, cell growth and differentiation.

This mitogen was revealed to be tissue factor pathway inhibitor-2 (TFPI-2), which is a Kunitz-type serine protease inhibitor. TFPI-2 was expressed in baby hamster kidney cells using a mammalian expression vector. Recombinant TFPI-2 (rTFPI-2) stimulated DNA synthesis and cell proliferation in a dose-dependent manner (1–500 nm). rTFPI-2 activated mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activity and stimulated early proto-oncogene c-fos mRNA expression in smooth muscle cells. MAPK, c-fos expression and the mitogenic activity were inhibited by a specific inhibitor of MAPK kinase, PD098059. Thus, the mitogenic function of rTFPI-2 is considered to be mediated through MAPK pathway. TFPI has been reported to exhibit antiproliferative action after vascular smooth muscle injury in addition to the ability to inhibit activation of the extrinsic coagulation cascade.

In this study, we purified a mitogen for growth-arrested bovine aortic smooth muscle cells from the supernatant of cultured HUVEC1 and identified it as TFPI-2, whose physiological function has been unknown. TFPI-2 is structurally related to TFPI. TFPI is synthesized in endothelial cells and exists on the endothelial surface and in plasma (2Jesty J. Wun T.C. Lorenz A.

Recently, an antiproliferative action of TFPI has been reported. In the atherosclerotic rabbit arterial injury model, treatment with recombinant TFPI reduced angiographical restenosis and decreased neointimal hyperplasia (6Jang Y. Guzman L.A. Lincoff M.

Inhibition of TF-mediated coagulation by recombinant TFPI administration during the first 24 h after balloon-induced arterial injury at the carotid artery of minipigs seems to be effective for attenuating subsequent neointimal formation and luminal stenosis (7Oltrona L. Speidel C.M. Recchia D. Wickline S.A. Eisenberg P.R. Abendschein D.R. Circulation. 1997; 96: 646-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). TFPI exhibits inhibitory activity toward cultured human neonatal aortic smooth muscle cells (8Kamikubo Y. Nakahara Y. Takemoto S. Hamuro T. Miyamoto S. Funatsu A. FEBS Lett. 1997; 407: 116-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). However, TFPI-2 has a mitogenic activity despite its similarity of structure to TFPI. This new function of TFPI-2 may play an important role in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis and neointimal hyperplasia after percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells were cultured as described previously (9Seiichiro W. Miyahara K. Toda K. Ogoshi S. Doi Y. Ohnishi S. Mitsui Y. Yui Y. Kawai C. Shizuta Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 216: 729-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Bovine aortic smooth muscle cells were isolated from the medial layers of adult bovine aorta by a modification of the explant technique of Ross as described previously (10Shirotani M. Yui Y.

In brief, they were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS), penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml). Cells were grown at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 in air. Culture medium (DMEM + 10% FCS) was changed every 3 days, and a confluent smooth muscle cell monolayer was obtained after about 7 days. Cells were used from the second to the sixth passage. Cells were harvested with 0.1% trypsin-0.02% EDTA solution and plated at a density of 2.0 × 105 cells in 10-cm dish (Nalge Nunc) for 48 h, after which their growth was arrested with DMEM containing 0.1% FCS. After 48 h, fresh medium (DMEM + 0.1% FCS) and different concentrations of mitogen (TFPI-2) were added simultaneously to the growth-arrested cells. After 48 h, cells were recovered using the trypsin/EDTA solution, and cell counts were performed with a hemocytometer. For the detection of DNA synthesis, cells were plated at a density of 3,000 cells/well in 96-well plates. Biotrak Cell proliferation enzyme-liked immunosorbent assay system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was used. 5-Bromo-2′-deoxyuridine (BrdUrd) was added 24 h after TFPI-2 addition. After 9 h, incorporated BrdUrd was assayed. A mitogen was purified from the conditioned HUVEC medium. Medium (800 ml) was concentrated to 20 ml using an ultrafiltration membrane (YM 10, Amicon) at 4° C. This 20-ml solution was applied to HiTrap Heparin affinity column (5 ml, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) previously equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4). Following sample application, the column was washed with 50 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) solution. Mitogenic activity was eluted with 20 ml of 50 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.4) containing 1 m NaCl. The eluent was concentrated to 0.5 ml by Centriprep 10 (Amicon). This sample was injected to ProRPC HR 5/10 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using LC-6A high performance liquid chromatography system (Shimadzu Co.). The flow rate was 1 ml/min. The peak was monitored at 280 nm. The column was eluted with a gradient formed from 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in 20% acetonitrile to 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in 100% acetonitrile. The mitogenic fraction eluted from the column was freeze-dried. Amino acid sequence analysis was carried out by automated Edman degradation using an Applied Biosystems 470 A gas-phase sequencer (Perkin-Elmer). SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was performed using Phast System (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The protein was stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. The molecular size marker used was obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. The mammalian expression vector pK4K was used for the construction of the expression vector designated as pK4KT2 (11Niidome T. Teramoto T. Murata Y. Tanaka I. Seto T. Sawada K. Mori Y. Katayama K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 203: 1821-1827Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). This vector contains unique restriction sites for HindIII and BamHI. The TFPI-2 cDNA was made using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with a sense oligonucleotide 5′-ATGGACCCCGCTCGCC-3′ and antisense oligonucleotide 5′-GCCATAAAGACAAACAAGAT-3′, which corresponded to nucleotides 39–54 and 761–782 of TFPI-2, respectively. The template was pBluescript II SK(−) containing TFPI-2 cDNA (Stratagene). This PCR product was blunted (DNA Blunting Kit, Takara Biochemicals) and ligated into the above vector after blunting. The sequence of PCR product was confirmed with automated DNA sequencer 373A (Applied Biosystems, Perkin-Elmer). Nontransfected baby hamster kidney (BHK) tk− ts13 cells were grown in DMEM supplemented with 5% FCS, streptomycin (30 μg/ml), and penicillin (30 units/ml). BHK cells (2 × 105 cells) were transfected with 5 μg of pK4KT2 by a modified CaPO4precipitation technique using the CellPhect transfection kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The transfected cells, BHKT2, were grown in DMEM containing 5% FCS. After selection with 250 nmmethotraxate, cell culture supernatants were collected and used for the isolation of recombinant TFPI-2 (rTFPI-2). rTFPI-2 was purified from conditioned BHK medium by the method described under “Purification and Identification of TFPI-2.” rTFPI-2 was identified by the retention time on the chromatogram, SDS-PAGE analysis, and the peptide sequence analysis (data not shown). Serum-starved cells in 24-well plates were exposed to 500 nm TFPI-2 in DMEM + 0.1% FCS. After incubation for the periods indicated in Fig. 6, the supernatant was removed. 100 μl of 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1 mm EDTA, 2.5% SDS, and 5% mercaptoethanol was added to the well. The dissolved cell fractions were separated on 8–25% gels by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis using Phast System. The proteins were then blotted onto nitrocellulose (Hoefer Scientific Instruments) by semi-dry electroblotting with Phast Transfer (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 30 min. The blots were blocked for 1 h with 10% bovine serum albumin in Tris-buffered saline (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6) and 137 mm NaCl). The blots were then washed five times in the same buffer containing 0.1% Tween-20. This washing was performed between each subsequent step. The blots were incubated sequentially with the monoclonal antibody (Promega Inc.) against phosphorylated MAPK (P44/ERK1 and P42/ERK2, which show no cross-activity with nonphosphorylated MAPK) diluted in Tris-buffered saline (25 ng/ml) for 1 h, with the biotinylated F(ab′)2 rabbit anti-mouse immunoglobulin G (Serotec Ltd.) for 1 h, and with the streptavidin-alkaline phosphatase conjugate for 1 h. Finally, nitro blue tetrazolium and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate p-toluidine salt were added to detect specific proteins, and the reaction was stopped by washing in distilled water. Bovine aortic smooth muscle cells were plated in 60-mm dishes (Nalge Nunc) for 48 h, after which their growth was arrested with DMEM containing 0.1% FCS. After 48 h, fresh medium (DMEM + 0.1% FCS) and different concentrations of mitogen (TFPI-2) were added simultaneously to the growth-arrested cells. PD098059 was added 30 min before rTFPI-2 stimulation. After incubation, MAPK activity was measured using a P44/42 MAP kinase assay kit (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The chemiluminescent intensity was determined using NIH image. The human c-fos promoter (12Straaten F.S. Müller R. Curran T. Beveren C.V. Verma I.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A sense oligonucleotide was 5′-GGGGTACCATTCTGCGCCGTTCC-3′, and an antisense oligonucleotide was 5′-GAAGATCTGCTCAGTCTTGGCTTCTC-3′. The template was human genomic DNA from whole blood (Promega). The sequence of PCR product was confirmed with automated DNA sequencer 373A (Applied Biosystems, Perkin-Elmer). Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega) was used. The PCR product was ligated intoKpnI-BglII site in pGL3-Basic Vector. This c-fos reporter plasmid (5 μg) was transiently transfected in bovine smooth muscle cells (106 cells) with pRL-SV40 Vector (0.5 μg) by the CellPhect transfection Kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). After 12 h, the precipitate was removed, and the cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were starved for 48 h in DMEM with 0.1% FCS. After incubation with 500 nm rTFPI-2 with or without PD098059 for 30 min, cells were collected and lysed in lysis buffer. Luciferase activity was assayed in Aloka BLR-201 Luminesence Reader according to the manufacturer's instructions. PD098059 was added 30 min before rTFPI-2 stimulation. Cells were prepared as described under “MAPK Activity.” Isolation of total cellular RNA from stimulated cells (108 cells) was obtained using Ultraspec-II RNA isolation system (Biotecx Laboratories, Inc.). Total RNA (20 μg/lane) was size-fractionated by electrophoresis on 1% agarose gels containing 18% formaldehyde. Capillary transfer to N+ nylon (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was performed overnight. Prehybridizations were carried out at 42° C for 4 h in prehybridization buffer (4× SSC, 1% SDS, and 1× Denhardt's solution). Hybridizations were carried out at 42° C for 18 h in hybridization buffer (4× SSC, 1× Denhardt's solution, 1% SDS, and 100 μg/ml salmon sperm DNA) containing 2 × 106cpm/ml of 32P-labeled ([α-32P]dCTP, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) cDNA probes. The cDNA probes, c-fos (Takara Biomedicals) and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (CLONTECH) were labeled using a Ready-To-Go DNA labeling kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Washes were performed at 42° C in 2× SSC, 0.1% SDS, 55° C in 2× SSC, 0.1% SDS and finally at 55° C in 0.5× SSC, 0.1% SDS. Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase was used as a control to check for equal loading in each lane and washed in the same conditions as above. Autoradiograms were obtained using BAS 2000 system (Fuji Film). Protein concentration was determined by Bio-Rad protein assay. All reagents were of analytical grade. PD098059 was purchased from Calbiochem. Polyclonal anti-human PDGF-AB antibody (neutralizing) was obtained from Upstate Biotechnology Inc. The results are expressed as the means ± S.E.

Fig. 3 shows the effect of rTFPI-2 on the cell proliferation of the growth-arrested bovine aortic smooth muscle. In a dose-dependent manner (1–500 nm), rTFPI-2 increased the cell growth. Fig.4 shows the time course of the cell proliferation. Cell counts increased from day 0 to day 6. To confirm the mitogenic character of rTFPI-2, we assayed BrdUrd incorporation into DNA. In Fig. 5, BrdUrd was found to be incorporated into DNA by rTFPI-2 stimulation dose-dependently. In the Fig.6 experiment, instead of 0.1% FCS, 10 ng/ml PDGF was used. In the presence of PGDF, the increased incorporation of BrdUrd was also observed.Figure 4Effect of rTFPI-2 on cell proliferation in vascular smooth muscle cells for 6 days.

At 30 min, a rapid increase was found in c-fos. After 2 h, c-fos expression disappeared. This c-fosexpression was inhibited dose-dependently by PD098059 (Fig.12).Figure 12Inhibition of c-fosexpression by PD098059. Growth-arrested smooth muscle cells (108 cells) were incubated with 500 nm rTFPI-2 and PD098059 in the presence of 0.1% FCS for 30 min, and Northern blot analysis was performed. PD098059 was pretreated 30 min before the experiment. Expression of c-fos and the housekeeping glucose-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (G3PD) was determined as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Depicted is an autoradiogram that represents three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To study the effect of the endothelial cells on the smooth muscle cell growth, the following co-culture system was used; a culture insert with a 1.0 μm membrane (3102, Becton Dickinson) along with cultured HUVEC was placed over bovine aortic smooth muscle cells grown in 6-well micro-test plates (3502, Becton Dickinson). When endothelial cells existed in the insert, the smooth muscle cell growth was found to be stimulated (data not shown). Based on this finding, we purified the mitogenic substance from the conditioned medium of the cultured HUVEC (Table I and Figs. 1 and 2), and this purified peptide proved to be identical to TFPI-2. The mitogenic activity of TFPI-2 has not been reported previously. To elucidate the mechanism of the mitogenic activity of rTFPI-2, we studied the signal transduction pathway for smooth muscle cell growth. TFPI-2 activated the 44- and 42-kDa MAPK rapidly and transiently (Fig. 7). MAPK/ERK is a key intermediate in a signal transduction pathway that links many types of cell surface receptors with nuclear events that initiate mitosis (12Straaten F.S. Müller R. Curran T.

Hypertension. 1998; 31: 248-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). TFPI-2 induced the activation of c-fos promoter (Fig. 10) and subsequent rapid and transient expression of c-fos mRNA (Fig. 11). PD098059, a specific inhibitor of MAPK kinase inhibited dose-dependently the activation of MAPK (Figs. 7 and 9), c-fos promoter activation (Fig. 10), and expression of c-fos mRNA (Fig. 12). These data suggest that TFPI-2 stimulates cell proliferation through MAPK activation and subsequent c-fos expression. Vascular smooth muscle cell growth is a key event in atherogenesis and the restenosis after percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty. In animal experiments, inhibition of TF-mediated coagulation with rTFPI has been reported to be effective in preventing neointimal formation and stenosis (6Jang Y. Guzman L.A. Lincoff M.

Khouri R.K. Arch. Surg. 1996; 131: 1086-1090Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Thrombin is a potent mitogen for smooth muscle cells. TFPI is an inhibitor of factor Xa alone or factor VIIa-TF complex in the presence of factor Xa. Factor Xa and factor VIIa-TF cause thrombin generation. Thus, the inhibitory action of cell proliferation and restenosis by rTFPI is considered due to the reduced thrombin generation secondary to inhibition of VIIa/TF and factor Xa. After balloon angioplasty, TFs exposed on the luminal surface of the vessel and factor X activation seem to play an important role in thrombus formation and the generation of thrombin. As a mechanism of prevention of restenosis by rTFPI, the direct inhibitory effect of rTFPI on the proliferation was proposed using cultured human neonatal aortic smooth muscle cells (8Kamikubo Y. Nakahara Y. Takemoto S. Hamuro T. Miyamoto S. Funatsu A. FEBS Lett. 1997; 407: 116-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The following mechanisms are proposed for mitogenic activity of rTFPI-2: (i) rTFPI-2 directly binds to its receptor on smooth muscle cell and stimulates the cell proliferation and (ii) similar to factor Xa (16Ko F.N. Yang Y.C. Huang S.C. Ou J.T. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 1493-1501Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), TFPI-2 functions via the stimulation of PDGF. However, this second possibility seems to be unlikely, because BrdUrd incorporation was not inhibited by anti-human PDGF-AB neutralizing antibody (Table II). In conclusion, TFPI has been reported to exhibit antiproliferative action against vascular smooth muscle after arterial injury in addition to the inhibition of the activation of the extrinsic coagulation cascade. However, the structurally similar TFPI-2 has been found to be mitogenic for smooth muscle cell. There may be a new mechanism by which these two peptides regulate smooth muscle cell proliferation."

We have now obtained evidence in human neutrophils indicating that this enzyme is regulated by a specific member of the mitogen-activated protein kinases, namely the p38 kinase. We earlier demonstrated that tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) as well asN-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine treatment leads to increased phosphorylation and activation of p38 kinase in human neutrophils. Strikingly, in the present study these stimuli increased the catalytic activity of acetyltransferase up to 3-fold, whereas 4-phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, which activates the extracellular-regulated kinases (ERKs) but not p38 kinase, had no effect. Furthermore, a selective inhibitor of p38 kinase, SB 203580, was able to abolish the TNF-α- andN-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine-induced activation of acetyltransferase. The same effect was not observed in the presence of an inhibitor that blocked ERK activation (PD 98059). Complementing the findings in intact cells, we have shown that recombinant, activated p38 kinase added to microsomes in the presence of Mg2+ and ATP increased acetyltransferase activity to the same degree as in microsomes obtained from TNF-α-stimulated cells. No activation of acetyltransferase occurred upon treatment of microsomes with either recombinant, activated ERK-1 or ERK-2. Finally, the increases in acetyltransferase activity induced by TNF-α could be ablated by treating the microsomes with alkaline phosphatase. Thus acetyltransferase appears to be a downstream target for p38 kinase but not ERKs. These data from whole cells as well as cell-free systems fit a model wherein stimulus-induced acetyltransferase activation is mediated by a phosphorylation event catalyzed directly by p38 kinase.

Much work has been devoted to determine how inflammatory lipid mediators are formed and their production regulated. In human neutrophils and other inflammatory cells, the PAF is synthesized in response to a variety of stimuli by a remodeling pathway in which 1-O-alkyl-2-arachidonoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (1-alkyl-2-AA-GPC) is converted to lyso-PAF (1-alkyl-2-lyso-GPC), which is then acetylated by acetyl-CoA:lyso-PAF acetyltransferase to form PAF. Physiologically, it is not clear whether the lyso-PAF is primarily generated by the direct action of PLA2 on 1-alkyl-2-AA-GPC (1Prescott S.A. Zimmerman G.A. McIntyre T.M. J. Biol.

Acetyl-CoA:lyso-PAF acetyltransferase was initially demonstrated and partially characterized by Wykle et al. (12Wykle R.L. Malone B. Snyder F. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 10256-10260Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The enzyme was found to be present in several rat tissues with the highest activity found in spleen. Furthermore, the reaction could be inhibited by divalent cations (Ca2+, Mn2+, and Mg2+). Both 1-O-alkyl- and 1-O-acyl-2-lyso-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine could act as substrates, but 3-O-alkyl-2-lyso-sn-glycero-1-phosphocholine could not, indicating the stereospecificity of this enzyme. It was later shown that this activity could be increased in PMN stimulated by A23187 (13Albert D.H. Snyder F. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 97-102Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), opsinized zymosan (13Albert D.H. Snyder F. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 97-102Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Alonso F. Gil M.G. Sanchez-Crespo M. Mato J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 3376-3378Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and PAF itself (15Doebber T.W. Wu M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 7557-7561Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Increases in acetyltransferase activity have also been observed in eosinophils from patients with eosinophilia compared with cells isolated from those with normal eosinophil numbers (16Lee T.-c. Malone B. Wasserman S.I. Fitzgerald V. Snyder F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1982; 105: 1303-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Subsequent to these findings, it was proposed by Lenihan and Lee (17Lenihan D.J. Lee T.-c. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1984; 120: 834-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) that the activation of acetyltransferase is regulated in a reversible activation/inactivation manner by phosphorylation. They showed that rat spleen microsomal acetyltransferase activity could be enhanced by the addition of the soluble fraction from rat spleen in the presence of ATP and Mg2+ (17Lenihan D.J. Lee T.-c. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1984; 120: 834-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Moreover, the addition of phosphatidylserine, diolein, and Ca2+ further enhanced the activity of acetyltransferase, leading the authors to speculate that protein kinase C may be involved in regulation of the acetyltransferase. Gomez-Cambronero et al. (18Gomez-Cambronero J. Velasco S. Mato J.M. Sanchez-Crespo M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 845: 516-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) later showed that rat spleen microsomal acetyltransferase activity could be increased by the catalytic subunit of cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase in the presence of Mg2+ and ATP; subsequent treatment of the microsomal preparations with alkaline phosphatase abolished the observed increase. It has also been shown that calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinases can lead to increased activation of acetyltransferase in vitro (19Domenech C. Machado-De Domenech E. Soling H.-D. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 5671-5676Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These earlier findings provided evidence that acetyltransferase activity is modulated by phosphorylation but have led to an unclear picture as to the specific kinase responsible for activation of the acetyltransferase in vivo. We now have obtained evidence in human neutrophils that a member of the MAP kinase family, namely p38 kinase, is responsible for the phosphorylation, and hence, activation of acetyltransferase. The recent development of specific inhibitors of p38 kinase (20Cuenda A. Rouse J. Doza Y.N. Meier R. Cohen P. Gallager T.F. Young P.R. Lee J.C. FEBS Lett. 1995; 364: 229-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (1981) Google Scholar), as well as the availability of purified recombinant, activated p38 enzyme, has allowed us to demonstrate that this enzyme activates acetyltransferase in whole cells and in a cell-free system. 1-O-[1,2-3H]Hexadecyl-2-lyso-GPC (56 Ci/mmol) was synthesized as described previously (21Wyrick S.D. McClanahan J.S. Wykle R.L. O'Flaherty J.T. J. Labelled Compd. Radiopharm. 1985; 22: 1169-1174Crossref Scopus (15) Google Scholar), except that 16:0 plasmenylcholine isolated from beef heart by reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography was used instead of 1-O-hexadec-9′-enyl-2-lyso-GPC. Unlabeled 1-alkyl-lyso-GPC and other phospholipid standards were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids, Inc. (Birmingham, AL). Dextran T-500 was from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech (Uppsala, Sweden). Isolymph was obtained from Gallard-Schlesinger (Carle Place, NY). Silica Gel G plates were from Analtech. PD 98059 and SB 203580 were obtained from Calbiochem-Novabiochem Intl. Recombinant, constitutively activated p38, ERK-1, and ERK-2 were obtained from Upstate Biotechnology Inc.(Lake Placid, NY). Tumor necrosis factor-α was from PeproTech, Inc. (Rocky Hill, NJ). Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) was purchased from LC Laboratories (Woburn, MA). Calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase was from Promega (Madison, WI). Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline, essentially lipid-free bovine serum albumin,N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (fMLP), pepstatin A, leupeptin, and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride were obtained from Sigma. Neutrophils were prepared from heparinized, venous blood collected from healthy, medication-free donors using dextran sedimentation, isolymph sedimentation, and brief hypotonic lysis to remove red blood cells as described previously (22DeChalelet L.R. Shirley P.S. Infect. Immun. 1982; 35: 206-212Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The resulting cell population consisted of >95% PMN. PMN (1 × 107/ml, 3 ml total) in phosphate-buffered saline containing 1.4 mm CaCl2 was incubated for 30 min at 4 °C, warmed at 37 °C for 5 min, treated with or without SB 203580 and/or PD 98059 for 30 min at 37 °C, and stimulated with the various agonists as detailed in figure legends. Reactions were terminated by the addition of 30 ml of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline without CaCl2, and cells were pelleted at 300 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Pelleted cells were resuspended in 1 ml of protection buffer (0.2 m Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), containing 50 μg/ml leupeptin, 50 μg/ml pepstatin A, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mm NaF, 0.2 mm Na3VO4) and sonicated twice for 8 s at a power setting of 2 and 10% output with a probe sonicator (Heat System Inc.). Acetyltransferase activity was determined according to the method of Wykle et al. (12Wykle R.L. Malone B. Snyder F. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 10256-10260Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Freshly isolated whole cell sonicates (100 μl, ∼75–100 μg of total protein) were incubated with acetyl-CoA (100 μm) and [3H]lyso-PAF (16 μm, 0.1 μCi/tube in 1 ml final volume). Reactions were carried out at 37 °C for 15 min and terminated by extraction of the lipids (23Bligh E.G. Dyer W.L. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (43132) Google Scholar). [3H]PAF was measured by chromatography Lipids were extracted by a modified Bligh and Dyer procedure (23Bligh E.G. Dyer W.L. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (43132) Google Scholar) in which 9% formic acid was added to lower the pH to between 3 and 4. Lipids were dried under a stream of nitrogen, resuspended in chloroform:methanol (4:1, v/v), and separated on Silica Gel G layers developed in chloroform:methanol:acetic acid:water (50:25:8:4, v/v/v/v). Phospholipids and standards were visualized by exposure to iodine vapor, whereas radiolabeled products were detected using a radiochromatogram imaging system (Bio-scan Inc., Washington, D.C.). For quantitation of radioactivity, individual lipid classes were scraped from thin layer plates and counted by liquid scintillation counting (Minaxi Tri-Carb 4000 series). PMN (7.5 × 107/ml) were treated with or without 1 nm TNF-α for 10 min. Treatments were terminated by the addition of 30 ml of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline without CaCl2, and cells were pelleted at 300 × gfor 10 min at 4 °C. Pelleted cells were resuspended in 1 ml of protection buffer (see above) and sonicated twice for 8 s at a power setting of 2 and 10% output with a probe sonicator (Heat System Inc.). Sonicates were centrifuged at 16,000 × g at 4 °C for 10 min to remove nuclei, granules, and cellular debris. Supernatant fluids were further centrifuged in an airfuge (Beckman Instruments) at 178,000 × g for 20 min at 25 °C. The membrane fractions were resuspended in 500 μl of 0.2m Tris-HCl (pH 7.5). Protein concentrations were determined according to the method of Bradford (24Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as the standard. Isolated membranes (40 μl, ∼5 μg of total protein) from untreated cells were immediately incubated at 37 °C with 2 μg of recombinant, activated p38, ERK-1, or ERK-2 in the presence of 500 μm Mg2+ and 40 μm ATP in a final volume of 50 μl. After 15 min, the entire 50 μl of kinase reaction mixture was added to a vessel containing acetyl-CoA (100 μm) and [3H]lyso-PAF (16 μm,0.1 μCi/tube) in 950 μl of 0.2 m Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) and incubated at 37 °C. The reaction mixtures were extracted after 15 min and analyzed for [3H]PAF formation as described above. As a positive control, microsomes from TNF-α-treated cells were incubated in the same manner except no protein kinases were added. Isolated membranes (15 μl, ∼5 μg of total protein) from either control cells or cells treated with TNF-α (1 nm) were incubated at 25 °C with 5 units of calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase in the presence of assay buffer (50 mm Tris (pH 9.3), 1 mm MgCl2, 100 μmZnCl2, 1 mm spermadine) in a final volume of 100 μl. After 15 min, the entire 100-μl reaction mixture was added to a reaction vessel containing acetyl-CoA (100 μm) and [3H]lyso-PAF (16 μm, 0.1 μCi/tube) in 900 μl of 0.2 m Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) and shaken at 37 °C. The reaction mixtures were extracted after 15 min and analyzed for [3H]PAF formation as described above. Previously, we investigated the abilities of selected agents (TNF-α, PMA, and chemotactic factors) to activate MAP kinase(s) in neutrophils and evaluated their subsequent impact on cPLA2activation. 2A. B. Nixon, J. T. O'Flaherty, L. M. S. Baker, and R. L. Wykle, unpublished observations. We found that although all the agents tested activated cPLA2, there were differences with regard to which MAP kinase cascade was utilized by the individual stimuli. TNF-α and PMA were shown to preferentially activate p38 kinase and ERKs, respectively. Further, it was shown that both pathways were activated by chemotactic factors (i.e.fMLP, C5a, and interleukin-8). We have now extended our studies to focus on the activation of acetyl-CoA:lyso-PAF acetyltransferase using the three test stimuli previously examined. Human PMN were treated with TNF-α (1 nm, 10 min), PMA (10 nm, 10 min), or fMLP (100 nm, 1 min), sonicated, and assayed to determine acetyltransferase activity (Fig. 1). We observed that treatment with TNF-α induced a 2–3-fold increase in acetyltransferase activity. Activation of acetyltransferase by fMLP was also consistently observed, although the enzyme was activated to a lesser degree. In contrast, there was no apparent activation of acetyltransferase upon treatment of neutrophils with PMA. Although baseline acetyltransferase activity varied from donor to donor, this general trend remained constant throughout our studies. To investigate the role(s) of the ERKs and p38 in acetyltransferase activation, we employed selective inhibitors against p38 kinase, SB 203580, or MAP kinase kinase, PD 98059. These drugs are highly selective for the respective kinases and do not appear to affect related protein kinases (20Cuenda A. Rouse J. Doza Y.N. Meier R. Cohen P. Gallager T.F. Young P.R. Lee J.C.

J. 1996; 319: 17-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) have shown that human PMN incubated with either 20 μm SB 203580 or 50 μm PD 98059 exhibits ∼80% inhibition of their respective ERK and p38 kinase responses. PMN were stimulated with TNF-α in the presence or absence of 20 μm SB 203580 or 50 μm PD 98059, either alone or in combination. We observed that TNF-α-induced acetyltransferase activity was almost totally abolished in the presence of the p38 blocker, SB 203580, but was not affected by the inhibitor of ERK activation, PD 98059 (Fig. 2). Additionally, treatment with both drugs together resulted in no further change compared with SB 203580 treatment alone. Albeit muted, similar response patterns were seen in PMN treated with fMLP (Fig. 2). fMLP alone induced a smaller but reproducible increase in acetyltransferase activity. We again observed that blockage of p38 by SB 203580 resulted in a loss of stimulated acetyltransferase activity whereas the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase inhibitor had no effect, either alone or in combination with the p38 inhibitor. To extend the findings from whole cells, we established a cell-free system to test and further explore the activation of the acetyltransferase by the MAP kinases. We employed microsomes from unstimulated cells as our acetyltransferase source and evaluated the effect of various recombinant, constitutively activated MAP kinases on acetyltransferase activity. It has been recognized for some time that the acetyltransferase is localized in an internal membrane source (32Ribbes G. Ninio E. Fontan P. Record M. Chap H. Benveniste J. Douste-Blazy L. FEBS Lett. 1985; 191: 195-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 33Record M. Ribbes G. Terce F. Chap H. J. Cell. Biochem. 1989; 40: 353-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), and although the compartment has not been unequivocally determined, it has been suggested that it resides in either the tertiary granule or endoplasmic reticulum membranes (34Mollinedo F. Gomez-Cambronero J. Cano E. Sanchez-Crespo M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 154: 1232-1239Google Scholar). Regardless of the exact source, microsomal fractions were found to contain the highest specific activity of acetyltransferase activity. Microsomes (∼5 μg of total protein) were incubated with recombinant, constitutively activated ERK-1, ERK-2, or p38 kinase in the presence of ATP and Mg2+. It should be noted that Mg2+ dramatically inhibits acetyltransferase activity (12Wykle R.L. Malone B. Snyder F. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 10256-10260Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and as a result, only 0.5 mm Mg2+ was used in the kinase assay. We have observed that this concentration of Mg2+ has little to no effect on acetyltransferase activity in our assay system (data not shown). Kinase reactions were allowed to incubate initially for 15 min, after which the entire mixture was added to a reaction vessel containing acetyl-CoA, [3H]lyso-PAF, and products assayed for acetyltransferase activity. We observed that acetyltransferase activity was increased 2–3-fold in microsomes isolated from neutrophils treated with TNF-α, confirming our earlier results with whole cell sonicates. Treatment with Mg2+ and ATP alone effected no change in acetyltransferase activity, but the addition of recombinant, constitutively activated p38 (2 μg) resulted in a dramatic increase in activity, reaching levels observed in microsomal membranes from TNF-α-treated cells (Fig.3). This increase was not observed when equivalent amounts (2 μg) of ERK-1 or ERK-2 were added. 3-Fold more protein kinase was tested (6 μg), and no further increases in acetyltransferase activity were observed, indicating that 2 μg of p38 gave full activation whereas even at higher levels, ERKs were still inactive (data not shown). These data indicated that p38, not the ERKs, is responsible for the phosphorylation and activation of acetyltransferase in human neutrophils. To further establish if the activation of acetyltransferase was because of a direct phosphorylation event, membranes from control or TNF-α-stimulated PMN were treated with alkaline phosphatase (Table I). Although the specific activity from unstimulated cells was higher than routinely observed, TNF-α still induced a 2–3-fold increase in acetyltransferase activity. Upon treatment with alkaline phosphatase, isolated membranes exhibited approximately 3-fold lower activity in control and 6-fold lower activity in stimulated preparations. In fact, phosphatase treatment reduced the activity of either treated or untreated membranes to the same level (0.234 nmol/μg/15 min). These results indicate that a phosphorylation event is crucial to not only the activation of acetyltransferase but also to its basal level of activation as assayed in stimulated or resting PMN, respectively.Table IEffect of alkaline phosphatase treatment on acetyltransferase activityTreatmentAlkaline phosphataseSpecific activitynmol/μg/15 minControl−0.628 ± 0.14Control+0.234 ± 0.06TNF-α−1.423 ± 0.11TNF-α+0.234 ± 0.14PMN (3 × 107 cells/3 ml of PBS containing 1.4 mm CaCl2) were treated with or without 10 nm TNF-α for 10 min at 37 °C; reactions were stopped, and membrane fractions were prepared. Microsomal protein (5 μg) was treated with (+) or without (−) 5 units of alkaline phosphatase for 15 min at 25 °C, and the membranes were subsequently assayed for acetyltranferase activity as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Data represent the mean ± S.E. of three experiments from different donors. Open table in a new tab PMN (3 × 107 cells/3 ml of PBS containing 1.4 mm CaCl2) were treated with or without 10 nm TNF-α for 10 min at 37 °C; reactions were stopped, and membrane fractions were prepared.

Acetyl-CoA:lyso-PAF acetyltransferase has long been thought to be regulated by a phosphorylation event; however, the specific kinase(s) responsible for phosphorylation has yet to be unequivocally determined. It has been suggested that protein kinase C (17Lenihan D.J. Lee T.-c. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1984; 120: 834-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), cAMP-dependent protein kinase (18Gomez-Cambronero J. Velasco S. Mato J.M. Sanchez-Crespo M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 845: 516-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), or calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinases (19Domenech C. Machado-De Domenech E. Soling H.-D. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 5671-5676Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) could activate acetyltransferase in vitro, but evidence for any one of these kinases specifically activating the enzyme in whole cells is lacking. Because acetyltransferase plays a critical role in modulating the biosynthesis of PAF, understanding its regulation may lead to novel therapeutic approaches. In the present studies, we investigated three agents (TNF-α, PMA, and fMLP) as potential activators of acetyltransferase in human neutrophils. We observed that the best activator of p38, TNF-α, was in fact the best activator of acetyltransferase. fMLP, which also activated p38, albeit to a lesser degree, correspondingly activated acetyltransferase to a lesser degree when compared with TNF-α. On the other hand, PMA had virtually no effect on p38 or acetyltransferase activity. The role of p38 in the activation of acetyltransferase was further suggested in studies of intact neutrophils in which the p38 selective inhibitor (SB 203580) blocked acetyltransferase activation, whereas the ERK inhibitor (PD 98059) did not. Next we were able to activate the acetyltransferase in microsomal preparations by adding a phosphorylating system containing constitutively active p38; correspondingly, constitutively active ERK failed to activate the acetyltransferase. Finally, the acetyltransferase activated by p38 could be inactivated by treatment with alkaline phosphatase. These findings fully support activation of acetyltransferase via phosphorylation of the enzyme by p38. Although we consistently observed no activation of acetyltransferase in response to PMA, various reports have shown that PMA can either activate or have no effect on acetyltransferase. Early reports by both Albert and Snyder (13Albert D.H. Snyder F. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 97-102Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in rat alveolar macrophages and by Domenechet al. (19Domenech C. Machado-De Domenech E. Soling H.-D. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 5671-5676Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in guinea pig exocrine cells clearly showed that PMA treatment did not significantly activate acetyltransferase. Conversely, Lenihan and Lee (17Lenihan D.J. Lee T.-c. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1984; 120: 834-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) found that acetyltransferase activity increased upon treatment of rat spleen microsomes with the soluble fraction from rat spleen along with Mg2+ and ATP, and because the activity could be further enhanced by the addition of phosphatidylserine, diolein, and calcium, the authors speculated that protein kinase C, the direct target of PMA, was playing a role (17Lenihan D.J. Lee T.-c. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1984; 120: 834-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). In the neutrophil, no clear consensus has been reached as to whether acetyltransferase is indeed activated by PMA. Our findings here and a number of earlier findings (35Sisson J.H. Prescott S.M. McIntyre T.M. Zimmerman G.A. J. Immunol. 1987; 138: 3918-3926PubMed Google Scholar, 36Nieto M.L. Velasco S. Crespo M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 2217-2222Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) indicate that PMA has little measurable impact on acetyltransferase activity. These observations disagree with those of Leyravaud et al. (37Leyravaud S. Bossant M.-J. Joly F. Bessou G. Benveniste J. Ninio E. J. Immunol. 1989; 143: 245-249PubMed Google Scholar), who showed that stimulation with PMA not only increased neutrophil acetyltransferase activity but also raised PAF production. These differences may reflect varying assay conditions including different concentrations and times of incubations with PMA. Also, under certain conditions, protein kinase C activation may be able to differentially link to p38 activation. For the purpose of our analyses, we selected relatively short incubations of cells with high PMA concentrations. Under these conditions the phorbol ester achieved optimal activation of ERKs. We were unable to find any concentration of PMA that appreciably activated p38. In any event, other studies provided alternative explanations for some of the observed differences. Nieto et al. (36Nieto M.L. Velasco S. Crespo M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 2217-2222Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) found that PMA could in fact stimulate PAF production in PMN; however, the PAF appeared to be synthesized de novo via the dithiothreitol-insensitive cholinephosphotransferase pathway. Because PMA caused no activation of acetyltransferase, Nieto et al.(36Nieto M.L. Velasco S. Crespo M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 2217-2222Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) accordingly concluded that PMA could only initiate PAF biosynthesis through the de novo pathway. Similar results were later obtained in human umbilical vein endothelial cells where PMA induced PAF formation solely through the de novo pathway (38Heller R. Bussolino F. Ghigo D. Garbarino G. Pescarmona G. Till U. Bosia A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21358-21361Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although dithiothreitol-insensitive cholinephosphotransferase activity is high in PMN, the remodeling pathway appears to be the more significant route by which PAF is synthesized in human PMN (39Mueller H.W. O'Flaherty J.T. Wykle R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 6213-6218Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The formation of PAF is dependent upon at least two enzyme activities, PLA2 and acetyltransferase. We have shown PMA can stimulate PMN to activate cPLA2, as well as to induce AA release when measured by mass,2 so it appears that within the context of the remodeling pathway, PMA can induce the generation of the obligate PAF precursor, lyso-PAF, by activating PLA2, but the acetylation of lyso-PAF does not occur at appreciable levels in response to the phorbol ester. Our results suggest one possible explanation for this relationship; acetyltransferase tightly controls the formation of PAF. Alternatively, the lyso-PAF precursor could be generated at a distinct site within the cell not accessible to acetyltransferase. The p38 kinase has largely been considered to be a stress-activated protein kinase in mammalian cells, as initial reports indicated that it was activated in cells exposed to hyperosmolality, UV radiation, and endotoxin (40Han J. Lee J.D. Bibbs L. Ulevitch R.J. Science. 1994; 265: 808-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (2420) Google Scholar, 41Raingeaud J. Gupta S. Rogers J.S. Dickens M. Han J. Ulevitch R.J. Davis R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7420-7426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2046) Google Scholar). More recently, other activators of p38 that act through heterotrimeric G-protein-coupled receptors have been identified that include interluekin-8 (42Knall C. Worthen G.S. Johnson G.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3052-3057Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar), fMLP, and PAF (43Nick J.A. Avdi N.J. Young S.K. Knall C. Gerwins P. Johnson G.L. Worthen G.S. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 975-986Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). PAF itself is known to stimulate PAF biosynthesis in neutrophils (44Tessner T.G. O'Flaherty J.T. Wykle R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 264: 4794-4799Google Scholar) and other cell types (15Doebber T.W. Wu M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

These observations agree with our findings, and we further conclude that the regulation of acetyltransferase occurs via a direct phosphorylation by p38. Although a complete definition of all the signaling components activated in response to PAF has not been elucidated, stimulation of neutrophils by PAF appears to trigger MAP kinase kinase-3 activation, and evidence suggests that this occurs through a pertussis toxin-insensitive pathway, possibly coupling to G2αq or Gα11 (43Nick J.A.

In conclusion, our results strongly indicate that p38 activates the acetyltransferase responsible for PAF biosynthesis both in intact neutrophils and cell-free preparations. The precise effect of the phosphorylation event on subsequent PAF formation is still unclear, because the activation of p38 impacts other enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of PAF, i.e. cPLA2 (29Kramer R.M.

The determination of the specific enzyme, which may control the overall flux through the PAF biosynthetic pathway, remains to be determined. Our findings lead us to conclude that protein kinase C does not activate the acetyltransferase in intact neutrophils. The findings fit a model in which both cPLA2 (30Borsch-Haubold A.G. Kramer R.M.

During the course of studies on N- andO-linked sugar chains of uTM, we have detected new structures with xylose at the reducing ends. Here, we present a detailed analysis of the novel sugar structures found in uTM. uTM was purified from human urine as reported previously (5Takahashi Y. Hosaka Y. Niina H. Nagasawa K. Naotsuka M. Sakai K. Uemura A. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1995; 73: 805-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). β-Glucuronidase (bovine liver) was obtained from Sigma. Sialidase (Arthrobacter ureafaciens) was purchased from Nacalai Tesque (Kyoto), β-galactosidase (Aspergillussp.) from Toyobo (Osaka), actinase E from Kaken Pharmaceutical (Tokyo), chondro-4-sulfatase and chondro-6-sulfatase from Seikagaku Kogyo (Tokyo), and monoclonal HNK-1 antibody from Cosmo Bio (Tokyo). Galβ1–4Xyl-PA and GlcAβ1–3Galβ1–3Galβ1–4Xyl-PA were prepared as described (16Makino Y. Kuraya N. Omichi K. Hase S. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 238: 54-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Standard partially O-methylated pyridylaminated (PA)-galactoses were prepared by pyridylamination of the corresponding partially O-methylated galactoses as reported (17Hase S. Ikenaka T. Matsushima Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1978; 85: 257-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). A Cosmosil 5C18-AR300 column (0.6 × 15 cm) was purchased from Nacalai Tesque, a Shodex NH2P-50 column (0.46 × 5 cm) from Showa Denko (Tokyo), a TSKgel sugar AXI column (0.46 × 7.5 cm) and Toyopearl HW-40F from Tosoh (Tokyo), Sephadex G-25, Sephadex LH-20, and a Mono Q HR 5/5 column from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, a μBondasphere 5C18–300Å column (0.39 × 15 cm) from Nihon Waters (Tokyo), an IonPac AS4A column (0.4 × 25 cm) from Dionex (Sunnyvale, CA), a YMC-Pack Diol-200G column (0.8 × 50 cm) from YMC (Tokyo), DC-Alifolien silica gel 60 plates from Merck, Advantec 51B filter papers from Toyo Roshi (Tokyo), and Spectrapor membrane tubing (MWCO: 25,000) from Spectrum Medical Industries (Los Angeles, CA). uTM (374 mg) was digested with 37 mg of actinase E in 3.7 ml of 0.2 m Tris–HCl buffer, pH 8.2, at 37 °C for 1 h. An additional 3.7 mg of the enzyme was then added, and the incubation was continued for 24 h. The digest was applied onto a Toyopearl HW-40F column (2.2 × 100 cm), and glycopeptides were eluted with 0.2 m ammonium acetate buffer, pH 6.0. PA sugar chains were prepared and purified according to the reported method (18Kuraya N. Hase S. J. Biochem. 1992; 112: 122-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). A freeze-dried glycopeptide fraction was heated with 1.6 ml of anhydrous hydrazine at 60 °C for 50 h followed byN-acetylation with 3.2 ml of saturated sodium bicarbonate solution and 128 μl of acetic anhydride. After desalting with Dowex 50 (H+), the solution was freeze-dried, and the residue was pyridylaminated with 160 μl of 2-aminopyridine reagent and 560 μl of reducing reagents prepared as reported (18Kuraya N. Hase S. J. Biochem. 1992; 112: 122-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Excess reagents were evaporated three times with 50 μl of toluene:methanol (1:1) under a stream of nitrogen at 60 °C for 10 min. HPLC was carried out using the following elution conditions. PA sugar chains were detected by fluorescence (excitation wavelength, 320 nm; emission wavelength, 400 nm). Elution Condition 1 for PA O-linked sugar chains: column, Cosmosil 5C18-AR300; flow rate, 2 ml/min at 25 °C; eluent, 20 mm ammonium acetate buffer, pH 6.0, containing 0.01% 1-butanol. After injecting a sample, the butanol concentration was increased linearly from 0.01 to 0.52% in 51 min and then to 1.0% in 12 min. Elution Condition 2 for methylation analysis: column, μBondasphere 5C18–300Å; flow rate, 1.0 ml/min at 25 °C; eluent, 0.1m ammonium acetate buffer, pH 6.0. After injecting a sample, the acetonitrile concentration was increased linearly from 0 to 70% in 45 min. Size fractionation HPLC: column, Shodex NH2P-50; flow rate, 0.6 ml/min at 25 °C. Two eluents, A and B, were used. Eluent A was acetonitrile:water:acetic acid (95:5:3, v/v/v) titrated to pH 7.3 with triethylamine, and Eluent B was water:acetic acid (100:3, v/v) titrated to pH 7.3 with triethylamine. The column was equilibrated with Eluent A. Three min after injecting a sample, linear gradient elution was performed to Eluent A:Eluent B (90:10, v/v) in 2 min and then to Eluent A:Eluent B (50:50 v/v) in 38 min. Anion-exchange HPLC: column, TSKgel Sugar AXI; flow rate, 0.3 ml/min at 73 °C. The eluent used was a mixture of 9 parts 0.8 mboric acid adjusted to pH 9.0 with potassium hydroxide and 1 part acetonitrile. Mono Q HPLC: column, Mono Q HR 5/5; flow rate 1.0 ml/min at 25 °C. The eluent used was water titrated to pH 9.0 with aqueous ammonia. Adsorbed samples were eluted with a linear gradient of ammonium sulfate from 0 to 1.0 m concentration. A PA sugar chain (100 pmol) was digested with 100 milliunits of Aspergillusβ-galactosidase in 20 μl of 50 mm ammonium acetate buffer, pH 4.5; with 2.5 milliunits of sialidase in 50 μl of 100 mm ammonium acetate buffer, pH 5.0; or with 100 units of β-glucuronidase in 100 μl of 200 mm ammonium acetate buffer, pH 5.0. Enzymatic reactions were carried out at 37 °C for 16 h and then terminated by heating at 100 °C for 3 min. A PA sugar chain (500 pmol) was methanolyzed with 50 mm HCl in methanol at 37 °C for 3 h (19Slomiany A. Kojima K. Banas-Gruszka Z. Slomiany B.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1981; 100: 778-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). After evaporation to dryness, the desulfated PA sugar chain wasN-acetylated with 120 μl of water:pyridine:acetic anhydride (5:25:1) on ice for 1 h. After evaporation of the solution, a small amount of O-acetyl groups was removed by heating the solution with 20 μl of 1.0 m aqueous ammonia at 100 °C for 5 min. The solution was then freeze-dried. Freeze-dried X2 (2 nmol) was permethylated with 0.1 ml of methylsulfinyl carbanion reagent (prepared from 25 mg of NaH and 0.8 ml of dimethyl sulfoxide) and 0.1 ml of methyl iodide as reported (20Hakomori S. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1964; 55: 205-208PubMed Google Scholar). The reaction mixture was placed on a Sephadex LH 20 column (0.9 × 24 cm), and the permethylated X2 was eluted with chloroform. One-ml fractions were collected, and each fraction was concentrated to dryness by blowing the solvent with nitrogen. The residue was dissolved in a small amount of chloroform, and the sample was purified by TLC using a silica gel plate and methanol:ethyl acetate (2:8, v/v) with one drop of acetic acid as a solvent. The fluorescent spots revealed under a UV lamp were scraped and combined, and the permethylated X2 was extracted with 2 ml of methanol. The extract was evaporated to dryness, and the permethylated X2 thus purified was then hydrolyzed with 50 μl of 4 mtrifluoroacetic acid at 100 °C for 3 h. The solution was freeze-dried, and the residue was pyridylaminated with 10 μl of 2-aminopyridine reagent and 35 μl of borane–dimethylamine complex reagent as reported (21Hase S. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 230: 225-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Excess reagents were evaporated three times with 50 μl of toluene:methanol (1:1 v/v) under a stream of nitrogen at 60 °C for 10 min (18Kuraya N. Hase S. J. Biochem. 1992; 112: 122-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The residue was dissolved in 5 μl of the electrophoresis buffer, and small amounts of contaminating materials were removed by paper electrophoresis. Paper electrophoresis was performed at 30 V/cm at 4 °C using a filter paper (30 cm) and water:acetic acid:pyridine (60:2:3, v/v). The area that migrated like PA GlcNAc was cut off, and PA derivatives of partiallyO-methylated PA monosaccharides were extracted from the paper 4 times each with 100 μl of water. A part of the solution (10 μl) was analyzed by reversed-phase HPLC using Elution Condition 2. Mass spectra were recorded using a Voyager-DE STR BioSpectrometry Workstation, a matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time of flight mass spectrometer (PerSeptive Biosystems, Framingham, MA). For mass spectrometry, PA sugar chains were dissolved in distilled water (10 pmol/μl). Aliquots of 0.5 μl were applied onto a sample plate. Subsequently, 0.5 μl of a matrix solution (10 mg/ml 2, 5-dihydroxybenzoic acid in 50% (v/v) acetonitrile) was mixed with the aliquot and allowed to dry. The analyzer was used in the linear mode. PA sugar chains were exchanged twice with 2H2O at room temperature with intermediate lyophilization and finally dissolved in2H2O (99.999 atom % 2H; Isotec, Miamisburg, OH). Samples were analyzed at 30 or 50 °C on a Varian Unity Inova 750 MHz NMR spectrometer. Chemical shifts (δ) are expressed by reference to internal acetone (δ 2.213 ppm at 50 °C, δ 2.218 ppm at 30 °C). A commercial HNK-1 monoclonal antibody was purified by gel filtration on a YMC-Pack Diol-200G column, and the IgM fraction was concentrated by ultrafiltration with an Amicon YM-30 membrane. Equilibrium dialysis was performed between 60 μl each of an antibody solution and an oligosaccharide solution using a Spectrapor membrane at 2 °C for 48 h (22Mega T. Hase S. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1991; 109: 600-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Three concentrations of X1 (160, 80, and 40 nm) and one concentration of X2 (80 nm) were used. PA GlcNAc was employed as an internal standard. After the dialysis, a part of the oligosaccharide fraction was removed, and the amounts of X1 and X2 were quantified by size fractionation HPLC. The binding constant was obtained by double-reciprocal plots of the concentration of the bound oligosaccharide versus that of the free oligosaccharide, as reported (23Mega T. Oku H. Hase S. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1992; 111: 396-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The structures of the PA sugar chains were assessed by two-dimensional sugar mapping. A PA sugar chain was chromatographed by reversed-phase (Elution Condition 1) and size fractionation HPLC, and its elution position was compared with those of standard PA sugar chains on a two-dimensional sugar map. The PA sugar chain was then digested sequentially with exoglycosidases, and the structure of the product was analyzed on the two-dimensional sugar map as reported (23Mega T. Oku H. Hase S. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1992; 111: 396-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The reducing ends of PA sugar chains were analyzed according to the reported method (24Hase S. Hatanaka K. Ochiai K. Shimizu H. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 1992; 56: 1676-1677Crossref Scopus (43) Google Scholar). PA sugar chains were hydrolyzed with 100 μl of 4 m trifluoroacetic acid at 100 °C for 3 h in evacuated sealed tubes. The solution was evaporated to dryness by a centrifugal concentrator, and the residue was N-acetylated with saturated sodium bicarbonate solution and acetic anhydride. The PA monosaccharides obtained were separated and quantified by anion-exchange HPLC. Component sugar analysis was done as reported (24Hase S. Hatanaka K. Ochiai K. Shimizu H. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 1992; 56: 1676-1677Crossref Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Glycopeptides were hydrolyzed with 100 μl of 4 m trifluoroacetic acid at 100 °C for 3 h. The solution was freeze-dried, and monosaccharides liberated were N-acetylated with saturated sodium bicarbonate solution and acetic anhydride. After desalting with Dowex 50 (H+), the solution was freeze-dried, and the monosaccharides were pyridylaminated with 2-aminopyridine and borane–dimethylamine complex. The excess reagents were removed under a stream of nitrogen gas with 40 μl of toluene at 40 °C. The residue was dissolved in a small amount of water, and a part of the solution was analyzed by anion-exchange HPLC. Sulfate ion was measured by ion chromatography. A PA sugar chain (2 nmol) was mixed with 20 μl of 20 mm sodium hydroxide. After heating at 250 °C for 30 min, the resulting sulfate ion was measured with a Dionex 20210i ion chromatography system using an IonPac AS4A column and 2.8 mm Na2CO3, 2.25 mm NaHCO3 at a flow rate of 1.5 ml/min (25.Sugahara, K., Masuda, M., Yamada, S., Harada, T., Yoshida, K., Yamashita, I., Proceedings of the 10th International Symposium on Glycoconjugates, Sept. 10, 1989, Sharon, N., Lis, H., Duskin, D., Kahane, I., 1989, 322, Jerusalem, Israel.Google Scholar). Sialic acid was measured by the reported method (26Hara S. Takemori Y. Yamaguchi M. Nakamura M. Ohkura Y. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 164: 138-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). Glycopeptides were prepared from 374 mg of uTM by digestion with actinase E, and the digest was purified by gel filtration. After component analysis of each fraction, the fractions that contained sugars were combined (data not shown). Sugar chains were liberated from the combined fraction by hydrazinolysis followed byN-acetylation, and the reducing ends of the sugar chains were pyridylaminated. To obtain an overall view of the sugar structures, the reducing ends of the PA sugar chain fraction were first analyzed. The acid hydrolysates of the PA sugar chain fraction were found to contain 0.39 μmol of PA Xyl, 3.0 μmol pf PA GlcNAc, 0.45 μmol of PA GalNAc, and 0.39 μmol of PA Gal (from a by-product obtained from Gal-GalNAc structures during the preparation (18Kuraya N. Hase S. J. Biochem. 1992; 112: 122-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar)), indicating that a sugar chain containing Xyl at the reducing end comprised about 8% (mol/mol) of the total sugar chains. Detection of PA Xyl indicated the presence of proteoglycan-type sugar chains; however, the linking of chondroitin sulfate chains was excluded as judged from the finding that the uTM bands on SDS–polyacrylamide electrophoresis gels were not changed by digestion with chondroitinase ABC (data not shown). The PA sugar chain fraction was digested with sialidase and analyzed by Mono Q HPLC, and a pass-through and adsorbed fractions were obtained. Reducing-end analysis of each fraction revealed that PA Xyl was present only in the acid hydrolysates of the adsorbed fraction, indicating that the xylose-containing sugar chains carried a negative charge(s) in addition to sialic acid (data not shown). The PA sugar chain fraction was applied onto a TSKgel HW-40F column, and an aliquot of each fraction was subjected to reducing-end PA monosaccharide analysis (Fig. 1). A fraction containing PA Xyl (Fraction X) was collected and further fractionated by reversed-phase HPLC (Fig.2). Reducing-end analysis of each peak showed that fractions X1 and X2 contained a PA Xyl residue as a major component. The other fractions and the fraction eluted between 25 and 60 ml did not contain appreciable amounts of PA Xyl. Other major peaks contained PA GalNAc, PA Gal, or PA GlcNAc as major components. Small amounts of contaminating materials were removed by size fractionation HPLC, and the final fractions were desalted on a Sephadex G-25 column (1 × 10 cm) using 10 mm ammonium acetate, pH 6.0, as an eluent. Starting from Fraction X, X1, and X2 were recovered at 17 and 26% (including losses during purification), respectively. X1 and X2 thus purified showed a single peak when analyzed by reversed-phase HPLC (data not shown) using Elution Condition 1 and size fractionation HPLC, indicating that X1 and X2 were pure.Figure 2Subfractionation of Fraction X by reversed-phase HPLC. Elution Condition 1 was used (see text).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The fluorescent fragments obtained by partial acid hydrolysis (100 °C in 1 mtrifluoroacetic acid for 15 min) of X1 appeared at the elution positions of GlcAβ1–3Galβ1–3Galβ1–4Xyl-PA, Galβ1–4Xyl-PA, and PA Xyl on a two-dimensional sugar map (Fig.3), indicating that X1 contained the linkage tetrasaccharide structure of proteoglycans. X1 had 1 mol of sulfate but no sialic acid (Table I). The elution position of X1 on the map was not changed by digestion with β-glucuronidase, chondro-4-sulfatase, or chondro-6-sulfatase (data not shown). When X1 was desulfated by methanolysis, the product appeared at the position of GlcAβ1–3Galβ1–3Galβ1–4Xyl-PA (Fig.3). X1 was not digested with β-glucuronidase, but desulfated X1 was then susceptible to β-glucuronidase digestion. These results indicated that the sulfate group was linked to the GlcA-Gal structure. On further digestion of the β-glucuronidase digest (positionD) with Aspergillus β-galactosidase, a new peak appeared at PA Xyl. These results suggested that X1 was SO4-GlcAβ1–3Galβ1–3Galβ1–4Xyl-PA.Table IComponent analysis of Fractions X1 and X2FractionPA XylSulfateNeu5AcX11.000.970.00X21.001.110.88Reducing end PA Xyl was measured as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Sulfate ion was measured by ion chromatography after heating with sodium hydroxide at 250 °C for 30 min.

The value of PA Xyl was taken as 1.00. The above findings were confirmed by measuring the molecular weight of X1 by mass spectrometry (Fig. 4). In the positive-ion mass spectrum, the peak of the molecule-related ion, [M + Na]+ (m/z 831.2, calculated 831.2), was observed. Loss of sodium sulfite with hydrogen transfer from the cation also occurred, resulting in an intense peak atm/z 729.2 (calculated 729.3). In the negative-ion mass spectrum also, the results verified the proposed structures of X1. The linkage position of the sulfate group was analyzed by1H NMR spectroscopy.

The proton signal at 4.605 ppm was assigned to H1 of Gal-2 and that at 4.668 ppm, to H1 of Gal-3 as compared with those of the unsaturated linkage hexasaccharide (R1). Analysis of the two-dimensional NMR spectra of the SO4-GlcA residues in X1 (Fig.5) revealed identical spin patterns to the SO4-3GlcA residues in the the synthetic trisaccharide, YM677 (R2) and oviducal mucin oligosaccharide (R3). Therefore, the proton signals at 4.757 and 4.317 ppm were, respectively, assigned to H1 and H3 of SO4-3GlcA, confirming that the HNK-1 disaccharide element was present in X1. Taking these results together with those given above, the structure of X1 was determined to be SO4-3GlcAβ1–3Galβ1–3Galβ1–4Xyl-PA.Table II1H chemical shifts of structural-reporter groups of constituent monosaccharides of X1, X2, and reference compoundsChemical shiftX1X2R1R2R350 °C30 °CppmXyl-1H24.0024.0114.016Gal-2H14.6054.5904.5954.617H44.1704.1964.2144.200Gal-3H14.6684.6544.6534.6684.5334.639H44.1704.1644.1704.1604.165GlcA-4H14.7574.7554.7564.6684.7604.761H34.3174.3184.3203.6244.3284.327Neu5AcH3e2.6882.685H3a1.6341.641NAc2.0122.012X2, SO4-3GlcA[4]β1–3Gal[3]β1–3(Neu5Acα2–6)Gal[2]β1–4Xyl-PA[1]; X1, SO4-3GlcA[4]β1–3Gal[3]β1–3Gal[2]β1–4Xyl-PA[1]; R1, ΔGlcAβ1–3GalNAcβ1–4GlcA[4]β1–3Gal[3]β1–3Gal[2]β1–4Xylol (27Sugahara K.

X1 was measured at 50 °C, X2 at 50 and 30 °C, R1 at 15 °C, R2 at 22 °C, and R3 at 27 °C. Partial acid hydrolysis of X2 gave the same fluorescent fragments as found for X1, indicating that X2 also contained the linkage tetrasaccharide structure. X2 had 1 mol each of a sulfate and Neu5Ac (Table I). The sialidase digest of X2 was eluted at the position of X1 on the two-dimensional sugar map (Fig. 3), indicating that X2 was a sialylated form of X1. The elution position of X2 on the map was also not changed by digestion with β-glucuronidase, chondro-4-sulfatase, or chondro-6-sulfatase (data not shown). When X2 was desulfated by methanolysis, the product appeared at position A (Fig. 3). Desulfated X2 was then susceptible to β-glucuronidase digestion, and the digest was eluted at position B. These results indicated that the sulfate group was linked to the GlcA-Gal structure. On further digestion of the β-glucuronidase digest withAspergillus β-galactosidase, a new peak with a molecular size 0.9 glucose units smaller appeared at position C. The sialidase digest of the β-galactosidase digest was eluted at the position of Galβ1–4Xyl-PA, indicating that Neu5Ac was linked to the Gal-Xyl structure (Fig. 3). Methylation analysis of X2 indicated 3,6-disubstituted and 3-substituted Gal structures (Fig.6). These results suggested that X2 was SO4-GlcAβ1–3Galβ1–3(Neu5Acα2–6)Galβ1–4Xyl-PA. The structure was confirmed by measuring the molecular weight of X2 by mass spectrometry (Fig. 4). In the positive-ion mass spectrum, peaks of the molecule-related ions, [M + Na]+(m/z 1122.2, calculated 1122.3) and [M + K]+ (m/z 1138.5, calculated 1138.3), were observed. Loss of sodium sulfite with hydrogen transfer from these cations also occurred, resulting in an intense peak atm/z 1020.2 (calculated 1020.4). In the negative-ion mass spectrum also, the results verified the proposed structure of X2. The linkage position of the sulfate group was analyzed by 1H NMR in the same manner as for X1. Analysis of the two-dimensional NMR spectra of the SO4-GlcA residue in X2 (Fig. 5) revealed identical spin patterns to the SO4-3GlcA residues in X1. Therefore, the proton signal at 4.756 ppm and that at 4.320 ppm were, respectively, assigned to H1 and H3 of SO4-3GlcA, confirming that the HNK-1 disaccharide element was also present in X2. Three typical signals (H3e 2.688, H3a 1.634, and NAc 2.012 ppm) of the Neu5Ac residue were observed. The NMR spectra of X2 were almost the same as those of X1 besides Neu5Ac and H4 of Gal-2. The H4 signal of Gal-2 in X1 was shifted, indicating that Neu5Ac was linked to C6 of Gal-2. Taking these results together with those given above, the structure of X2 is SO4-3GlcAβ1–3Galβ1–3(Neu5Acα2–6)Galβ1–4Xyl-PA. Double-reciprocal plots of the concentrations of the bound oligosaccharide (X1) versus those of the free oligosaccharide in equilibrium dialysis gave the binding constant of HNK-1 antibody to X1. The apparent association constant was 2.5 × 106m−1. The binding constant of X2, 1 × 106m−1, was smaller than that of X1. These analyses showed that Neu5Ac in X2 did not contribute to the binding to the antibody used. Analysis of sugar chains from human uTM revealed the presence of oligosaccharides with xylose at the reducing end. On the basis of the results obtained with X1 and X2, the structures were determined to be linkage tetrasaccharides of proteoglycans with SO4-3GlcA at the nonreducing end and with partial substitution of sialic acid. These are novel structures and to our knowledge are the first reported instance of a proteoglycan linkage tetrasaccharide with SO4-3GlcA and sialic acid residues solely linked to a glycoprotein. Because X1 and X2 were liberated and their structures determined by chemical means, the possibility of another chemically labile substituent(s) cannot be excluded. uTM does not contain chondroitin sulfate (2Yamamoto S.

Platelet factor 4 binds to the glycanated form of TM but not to the chondroitin sulfate-lacking TM (12Dudek A.Z. Pennell C.A. Decker T.D. Young T.A. Key N.S. Slungaard A. J. Biol.

Acceleration of the inhibition of thrombin by antithrombin III by TM is dependent upon the presence of chondroitin sulfate linked to TM (10Lin J.-H. McLean K. Morser J. Young T.A. Wydro R.M.

Hence, the binding of chondroitin sulfate seems to be important for several of the versatile functions of TM and to affect its cell-surface anticoagulant potential. Chondroitin sulfate is linked to Ser-474 in the high molecular weight TM of recombinant TM, but Ser-474 is also modified with a small substituent in the low molecular weight TM (9Gerlitz B.

Andrews W.H. Light D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25021-25030Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). By way of explanation of the fact that TM is expressed in two distinct forms, Gerlitz et al. (9Gerlitz B. Hassell T. Vlahos C.J. Parkinson J.F. Bang N.U. Grinnell B.W. Biochem. J. 1993; 295: 131-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) postulated a model involving glycosyltransferase competition between xylosyltransferase and N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase for Ser-474, whereas Lin et al. (10Lin J.-H. McLean K. Morser J. Young T.A. Wydro R.M. Andrews W.H. Light D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25021-25030Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) suggested that occupation of the adjacent O-linked glycosylation may be important because of the steric hindrance for xylosyltransferase of the cell line. If the new structures determined in the present paper link to a similar position, the following possibilities arise. The key step in producing the low molecular weight TM is the first GalNAc transfer reaction to the proteoglycan linkage tetrasaccharide regulated by sulfation at 3C of GlcA, which leads to regulation of the cell-surface anticoagulant potential. This is compatible with the finding that GalNAc transferase catalyzing chondroitin chain elongation cannot transfer GalNAc to 3-O-sulfated GlcA (30Kitagawa H. Tsutsumi K. Ujikawa M. Goto F. Tamura J. Neumann K.W. Ogawa T. Sugahara K. Glycobiology. 1997; 7: 531-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). This sulfation may be accomplished either with a similar sulfotransferase, as reported for the detection of SO4-3GlcAβ1–4Xylβ-4-methylumbelliferone from the substrate, 4-methylumbelliferyl β-Xyl (31Takagaki K.

These results suggest that glycosaminoglycan chain elongation of human TM seems to be abolished at the linkage tetrasaccharide core structure by addition of a sulfate group, indicating that 3-O-sulfation is a stop signal leading to TM lacking chondroitin sulfate.

Here I report that guanosine kinase is subject to efficient feedback inhibition by the end product of the pathway, GTP, and that this regulation is abolished by a previously described mutation, gsk-3, in the structural gene for guanosine kinase (Hove-Jensen, B., and Nygaard, P. (1989)J. Gen. Microbiol. 135, 1263–1273). Consequently, thegsk-3 mutant strain was extremely sensitive to guanosine, which caused the guanine nucleotide pools to increase dramatically, thereby initiating a cascade of metabolic changes that eventually led to growth arrest.By isolation and characterization of guanosine-resistant derivatives of the gsk-3 mutant, some of the crucial steps in this deleterious cascade of events were found to include the following: first, conversion of GMP to adenine nucleotides via GMP reductase, encoded by the guaC gene; second, inhibition of phosphoribosylpyrophosphate synthetase by an adenine nucleotide, presumably ADP, causing starvation for histidine, tryptophan, and pyrimidines, all of which require PRPP for their synthesis; third, accumulation of the regulatory nucleotide guanosine 5′,3′-bispyrophosphate (ppGpp), a general transcriptional inhibitor synthesized by the relA gene product in response to amino acid starvation.

Nygaard P. Neidhardt F.C. Curtiss III, R. Ingraham J.L. Lin E.C.C. Low K.B. Magasanik B. Reznikoff W.S. Riley M. Schaechter M. Umbarger H.E. 2nd ed. Escherichia coli and Salmonella: Cellular and Molecular Biology. 1. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1996: 561-579Google Scholar). Purine auxotrophic mutants can utilize exogenous guanosine by either of two pathways (Fig.1). One involves direct phosphorylation of guanosine to GMP by guanosine-inosine kinase (ATP:guanosine 5′-phosphotransferase (EC 2.7.1.73)) encoded by the gskgene. For simplicity I shall hereafter refer to this enzyme simply as guanosine kinase. The other pathway is initiated by phosphorolysis of guanosine to guanine and ribose 1-phosphate catalyzed by purine nucleoside phosphorylase encoded by the deoD gene. Subsequently guanine is phosphoribosylated to GMP by either guanine phosphoribosyltransferase or hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase, encoded by the gpt and hpt genes, respectively. Curiously, the latter two-step pathway predominates in vivo, even though it is energetically more costly. If, however, thedeoD gene is inactivated by mutation, guanosine can only be utilized via the guanosine kinase reaction, which seems to be inefficient (2Hove-Jensen B. Nygaard P. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1989; 135: 1263-1273PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, a purine-auxotrophic purE deoD mutant strain cannot grow with guanosine as the sole source of purines, apparently because too little GMP is formed by guanosine kinase to furnish the supply of both guanine nucleotides and adenine nucleotides. In line with this interpretation, Hove-Jensen and Nygaard (2Hove-Jensen B. Nygaard P. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1989; 135: 1263-1273PubMed Google Scholar) isolated from a purE deoD strain a number of mutant derivatives that were able to grow with guanosine as the sole source of purines and showed that these strains had acquired mutations in the gskgene, which apparently improved the efficiency of guanosine kinase. Fortuitously I discovered that one of these mutant alleles,gsk-3, paradoxically gave rise to a severe guanosine sensitivity when transduced into a wild type strain. Here I report that the apparent inefficiency of the guanosine kinase reaction is because of a tight feedback inhibition of the enzyme by GTP and that this regulation is abolished by the gsk-3 mutation. Thus, the extreme guanosine sensitivity of the gsk-3 mutant was found to be caused by an uncontrolled swelling of the guanine nucleotide pools in response to guanosine addition. Considering the ubiquitous roles of guanine nucleotides in vital cellular processes such as protein synthesis, RNA metabolism, and cell cycle control, I decided to investigate how such an increase of the guanine nucleotide pools interferes with cellular metabolism and growth. The present results show that the swelling of the guanine nucleotide pools were propagated to the adenine nucleotide pools, which restricted the synthesis of the central intermediary metabolite PRPP1 to impose starvation for pyrimidines and for the amino acids histidine and tryptophan, all of which require PRPP for their synthesis (reviewed in Ref. 3Jensen K.F. Munch-Petersen A. Metabolism of Nucleotides, Nucleosides, and Nucleobases in Microorganisms. Academic Press, Inc., London1983: 1-25Google Scholar). The starvation for histidine and tryptophan induced the accumulation of the regulatory nucleotide ppGpp, which is synthesized from GTP by therelA gene product, ppGpp synthetase I (for review see Ref.4Cashel M. Gentry D.R. Hernandez V.J. Vinella D. Neidhardt F.C. Curtiss III, R. Ingraham J.L. Lin E.C.C. Low K.B. Magasanik B. Reznikoff W.S. Riley M. Schaechter M. Umbarger H.E. 2nd ed. Escherichia coli and Salmonella: Cellular and Molecular Biology. 1. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1996: 1458-1496Google Scholar). ppGpp is the key mediator of the so-called “stringent response” to amino acid starvation and serves to inhibit the synthesis of rRNA, tRNA, and some mRNAs when substrates for protein synthesis are limiting. The ability to induce the synthesis of ppGpp is usually considered beneficial to bacterial cells, as it enables them to adjust more rapidly to changing growth conditions. However, the guanosine sensitivity of the gsk-3 mutant was found to be relieved by a deletion of the relA gene, indicating that the metabolic problems caused by guanosine addition was aggravated to an intolerable level by the accumulation of ppGpp. This finding may explain how thegsk-3 mutant could originally be selected for its ability to grow on guanosine, because this selection was performed on arelA mutant strain (2Hove-Jensen B. Nygaard P. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1989; 135: 1263-1273PubMed Google Scholar). The bacterial strains used in this study are all derivatives of E. coli K12 and are listed in Table I.

Exponentially growing cultures at an optical density of 0.05–0.1 were labeled with carrier-free32Pi (NEN Life Science Products) to give a specific activity of about 33 Ci/mol. Guanosine was added to 30 μg/ml at an optical density of 0.2–0.3. Immediately before and at various times after guanosine addition, samples for nucleotide pool-size determinations were harvested by pipetting 200 μl of culture into 40 μl of 2 m formic acid on ice. After standing at 0 °C for at least 20 min, the extracts were cleared by centrifugation, and 40 μl of supernatant were chromatographed two-dimensionally on polyethyleneimine plates as described in Ref. 13Jensen K.F.

The amount of radioactivity in PRPP and individual nucleotide spots were determined by counting of the dried chromatogram in an Instant Imager (Packard Inc.).

At an optical density of 0.9, 35 ml of culture were cooled on ice, washed once with 20 ml of 0.1m Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, and resuspended in 0.5 ml of the washing buffer. Cell were broken by sonication, and the extract was cleared by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 5 min followed by 2 h of dialysis against 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, in the cold. The protein content of the cellular extract was determined by the Lowry method using bovine serum albumin as standard. Immediately after dialysis, 75 μl of extract containing 5 mg/ml of protein was heated to 37 °C and mixed with 75 μl of prewarmed assay mixture yielding final concentrations in the assay of 80 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 35 mm MgCl2, 35 mm KCl, 2 mm ATP, and 0.5 mm[8-14C]guanosine (1.67 mCi/mmol) (2Hove-Jensen B. Nygaard P. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1989; 135: 1263-1273PubMed Google Scholar). When indicated, GTP was added at a final concentration of 2 mm. After various times of incubation at 37 °C, samples of 25 μl were removed from the assay and applied on a polyethyleneimine thin layer chromatography plate, which was developed in methanol to the application line and then in glass-distilled water. The radioactivity in guanine nucleotides, which unlike guanosine do not migrate in this system, was determined by counting of the dried chromatogram in an Instant Imager (Packard Inc.). In connection with other research on purine metabolism in E. coli, the gsk-3 allele was introduced into a purine prototrophic strain, CN1524, by P1 transduction (Table I). Unexpectedly, the resulting strain, CN1932, was found to be extremely sensitive to guanosine. At 30 μg/ml, guanosine prevented colony formation on glucose minimal medium plates, whereas growth of the isogenicgsk + parental strain, CN1524, was unaffected by guanosine (Table II). Growth of CN1932 in liquid culture was also severely inhibited by guanosine and ceased almost completely within 2 h after the addition of the nucleoside (Fig. 2 a). Exposure to guanosine, however, was not lethal but only bacteriostatic; the viability of CN1932 was not reduced after several hours of incubation with the nucleoside (data not shown). Interestingly, CN1932 was not sensitive to inosine, the other substrate of guanosine kinase (Fig. 1), presumably because the gsk-3 enzyme functions less efficiently with this nucleoside as substrate.Table IIEffect of guanosine and various supplements on the growth of the gsk-3 mutant and its relatives on glucose minimal mediumStrainAddition to mediumNoneGuanosineGuanosine + HisGuanosine + TrpGuanosine + His + TrpGuanosine + uracilGuanosine + uridineCN1524 (gsk +)+++++++CN1932 (gsk-3)+−−−+−−CN2031 (gsk-3 udp::Tn5)+−−−+−+Plates were inspected after 24 h of incubation at 37 °C. + indicates normal growth, − indicates no visible growth.

Guanosine was added to 30 μg/ml, uracil to 20 μg/ml, and histidine, tryptophan, and uridine to 40 μg/ml. To trace the mechanisms by which guanosine affects nucleotide metabolism and cellular growth, I measured how the nucleotide pools of the gsk-3 mutant change in response to guanosine addition (Fig. 3). Within 3 min after the addition of guanosine to CN1932, the GTP pool increased 3-fold, whereas the PRPP pool decreased by a factor of six. Most noteworthy, the regulatory nucleotide, ppGpp, also accumulated during the first 10 min after guanosine addition, signaling a restriction on the amino acid supply for protein synthesis. Later on, the GTP pool continued to increase to very high levels, whereas the PRPP pool decreased even further. PRPP is a central precursor metabolite that is required for the synthesis of purines, pyrimidines, and nicotinamide coenzymes as well as for the amino acids histidine and tryptophan (reviewed in Ref. 3Jensen K.F. Munch-Petersen A. Metabolism of Nucleotides, Nucleosides, and Nucleobases in Microorganisms. Academic Press, Inc., London1983: 1-25Google Scholar). The dramatic reduction of the PRPP pool and the concomitant induction of ppGpp synthesis suggested that guanosine might impose starvation for histidine and tryptophan by restricting the availability of PRPP. In support of this notion, supplementation with histidine and tryptophan enabled the gsk-3 mutant to form colonies on minimal medium in the presence of guanosine, whereas no growth was observable in the presence of either amino acid alone (Table II). Moreover, the addition of hisitidine and tryptophan together with guanosine almost eliminated the accumulation of ppGpp (data not shown). Eventually the guanosine-induced decrease of the PRPP pool also impaired the synthesis of pyrimidines, as indicated by the depletion of the UTP pool (Fig. 3), a sign of severe pyrimidine starvation. Supplementation with the pyrimidines uracil or uridine alone did not eliminate the guanosine sensitivity of CN1932 (Table II). However, this was probably because salvage of uracil by uracil phosphoribosyltransferase requires PRPP, and exogenous uridine is predominantly phosphorylyzed to uracil by uridine phosphorylase encoded by the udp gene (reviewed in Ref. 14Neuhard J. Kelln R.A. Neidhardt F.C. Curtiss III, R. Ingraham J.L. Lin E.C.C. Low K.B. Magasanik B. Reznikoff W.S. Riley M. Schaechter M. Umbarger H.E. 2nd ed. Escherichia coli and Salmonella: Cellular and Molecular Biology. 1. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1996: 580-599Google Scholar). A derivative of CN1932 carrying a disrupted udp gene, CN2031 (Table I), was indeed found to be rescued by supplementation with uridine (Table II), which could now be salvaged exclusively by direct phosphorylation to UMP by uridine kinase. It is generally considered that the most important physiological inhibitor of PRPP synthetase is an adenine nucleotide, presumably ADP (3Jensen K.F. Munch-Petersen A. Metabolism of Nucleotides, Nucleosides, and Nucleobases in Microorganisms. Academic Press, Inc., London1983: 1-25Google Scholar). However, guanine nucleotides can act as competitive inhibitors of PRPP synthetase in vitro (15Switzer R.L. Sogin D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 1063-1073Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and apparently to some extentin vivo as well (16Sadler W.C. Switzer R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 8504-8511Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The finding that the ATP pool in thegsk-3 mutant remained fairly constant during the first 10 min after guanosine addition (Fig. 3) suggests that the initial dramatic decrease of the PRPP pool was caused by the increase of one or more of the guanine nucleotide pools. After 10 min, the pool of ATP, and presumably of ADP as well, started to increase in parallel with the GTP pool, most likely because of conversion from GMP via theguaC pathway (Fig. 1). This increase of the adenine nucleotide pools probably contributed to the further reduction of the PRPP pool seen at later times. It is noteworthy that the purine deoxyribonucleotide pools also increased dramatically in response to guanosine addition, in particular the dATP pool, reached a size corresponding to that of the ATP pool in normally growing cells (Fig. 3). Presumably, these increases were caused by an increase of the pools of ADP and GDP, which are the substrates for nucleoside diphosphate reductase (Fig. 1). This enzyme is inhibited by dATP (reviewed in Ref. 17Thelander L. Reichard P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1979; 48: 133-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (913) Google Scholar), but the feedback regulation was apparently not sufficiently tight to prevent the marked swelling of the dGTP and dATP pools under conditions of increased substrate pools. This may have been because the pool of ATP, which is an activator of the enzyme, was also very large. In contrast to the gross disturbances of nucleotide metabolism seen in the gsk-3 mutant, only minor changes occurred in the nucleotide pools of the isogenic gsk + strain CN1524 in response to guanosine addition (Fig.4). Apart from a slight and transient increase of the GTP and ATP pools, the only notable feature was a marked swelling of the PRPP pool initiating approximately 10 min after guanosine addition. This increase, which did not affect the growth of CN1524 significantly (Fig. 2 a), may be explained by the fact that this strain, like all the others described in this work, carries a deletion of the gpt gene encoding guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (see “Discussion”). The dramatic increase of the guanine nucleotide pools in the gsk-3 strain compared with itsgsk + parent suggested that the mutation did indeed increase the efficiency of guanosine kinase, as proposed by Hove-Jensen and Nygaard (2Hove-Jensen B. Nygaard P. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1989; 135: 1263-1273PubMed Google Scholar). However, these investigators did not find a significantly higher level of enzymatic activity in extracts of the mutant strain and, thus, suggested that the improvement of the mutant enzyme was of a qualitative nature. The data of the previous section suggested that the primary effect of the mutation might be to eliminate feedback inhibition of guanosine kinase by one or more of the guanine nucleotides. To test this possibility I investigated how the addition of GTP affected the activity of guanosine kinase in crude extracts of CN1861 and CN1936, a pair of isogenic strains carrying thegsk + and gsk-3 alleles, respectively (Table I). In addition, these strains contain a mutation of thedeoD gene to eliminate competition from the purine phosphorylase reaction. As shown in Fig.5, the activity of the wild type guanosine kinase was almost eliminated by the addition of 2 mm of GTP to the assay, whereas the activity of the mutant enzyme was only reduced by approximately 20%. The physiological concentration of GTP is approximately 1 mm (18Neuhard J. Nygaard P. Ingraham J.L. Low K.B. Magasanik B. Neidhardt F.C. Schaechter M. Umbarger H.E. Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium: Cellular and Molecular Biology. 1. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1987: 445-473Google Scholar), so it is likely that the inhibition observed here in vitro is responsible for the apparent inefficiency of the wild type guanosine kinase in vivo. Conversely, the apparent desensitization of the enzyme to this inhibition by the gsk-3 mutation satisfactorily accounts for the uncontrolled swelling of the GTP pool in the mutant strain. In the experiments shown in Fig. 5 there was a 2-fold higher activity in the mutant extract than in the wild type extract even in the absence of GTP, in apparent contradiction to the finding of an essentially unchanged level of enzymatic activity in the original gsk-3isolate (2Hove-Jensen B. Nygaard P. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1989; 135: 1263-1273PubMed Google Scholar). However, during the performance of these experiments, I observed that the absolute levels of enzymatic activity were somewhat variable because of a marked instability of particularly the wild type enzyme in the crude extract. In other experiments more similar levels of activity were obtained for the two strains, in agreement with the previously published results. In light of these problems, it should be stressed that these experiments have been repeated several times, always by dividing the extracts and adding GTP to one half immediately before assaying. Irrespective of the absolute levels obtained, the inhibition by GTP were always more than 90% for the wild type and less than 20% for the mutant enzyme. Thus, I believe that the guanosine-sensitive phenotype of the gsk-3 mutant was caused by this qualitative difference, not by an increase of enzymatic activity, which in any event was less than 2-fold. In agreement with this supposition, I have observed that introduction of a multicopy plasmid containing the wild type gsk gene, pGSK2 (19Harlow K.W. Nygaard P. Hove-Jensen B. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 2236-2240Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), does not give rise to guanosine sensitivity. To gain further insight into the mechanisms by which the increased guanine nucleotide pools inhibit PRPP synthesis and cellular growth, I attempted to isolate guanosine-resistant derivatives of the gsk-3 strain CN1932. Such mutants were readily isolated at a frequency of 7 × 10−6; however, an initial characterization of seven guanosine-resistant mutants revealed that the responsible mutation mapped to the region of the gsk gene and resulted in a loss of guanosine kinase activity (data not shown). To avoid repetitive selection of such simple loss of function mutations in thegsk gene, I isolated guanosine-resistant derivatives of thegsk-3 strain, CN1936, in which both the gpt andhpt genes are inactivated by mutation (Table I). I have observed that strains in which salvage of guanosine is completely blocked by triple mutations in the gpt, hpt, andgsk genes (Fig. 1) fail to form colonies on rich medium for reasons that are not entirely clear. 2C. Petersen, unpublished data. Thus, mutant derivatives of CN1936 that had become resistant to guanosine because of mutations in the gsk gene could easily be identified and discarded on account of their inability to form colonies on Luria broth medium. One guanosine-resistant mutant, CN2079, that was not rich medium-sensitive and did not appear to carry a mutation in the vicinity of the gsk locus was selected for further characterization. By P1 transduction, the mutation responsible for the guanosine resistance was mapped to the approximate position of theguaC gene at 4 min on the genomic map (data not shown). Furthermore, CN2079 became sensitive to guanosine upon transformation with a plasmid, pGS235, that carries a functional guaC gene flanked by 209 and 121 base pairs of upstream and downstream sequence, respectively (10Andrews S.C. Guest J.R. Biochem. J. 1988; 255: 35-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). These results indicated that the guanosine resistance of CN2079 was caused by a loss of function mutation in theguaC gene, which could be complemented by a functional gene copy in trans. The guaC mutation of CN2079, now designatedguaC2079, was moved into CN1932 by P1 transduction, and as expected, the resulting strain, CN2133 (Table I), was resistant to guanosine. In addition, CN1932 could also be made resistant to guanosine by introduction of the guaC23 allele, a previously characterized loss of function mutation in the guaC gene (20De Haan P.G. Hoekstra W.P.

However, no information on in vivo stability of such peptide analogues and the possible direct contribution of this resistance in their ability to modulate the immune response is available.

To examine the possible influence of proteolytic resistance of MHC class I binding peptides on their biological activity, we designed a series of eight reduced peptide bond pseudopeptides of the immunodominant CD8+ T cell epitope of LCMV in C57BL/6 (B6, H-2b) mice. This CTL epitope (called GP33) is located in residues 33–41 of the LCMV glycoprotein (23Pircher H. Moskophidis D. Rohrer U. Burki K. Hengartner H. Zinkernagel R.M. Nature. 1990; 346: 629-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar). We tested the capacity of these eight analogues, each containing one reduced peptide bond Ψ(CH2–NH) at successive positions, to bind to H-2Db MHC molecules. The peptides that bound significantly to H-2Db were further analyzed with respect to their recognition by GP33-specific T cells from a Tg mouse that expresses a H-2Db-restricted T cell receptor specific for this epitope and for their ability to induce antiviral protection.DISCUSSIONThe use of peptides corresponding to MHC class I epitopes to induce a protective CTL response against viruses or tumors is of particular interest in the development of peptide-based vaccines. Recent investigations have suggested that antigenic pseudopeptides containing one or several peptide bond isosters might advantageously replace natural peptides in therapeutic strategies because they can bind to MHC class I molecules and generate an efficient T cell response (7Guichard G.

In this study, we have examined the antigenic and immunogenic properties of pseudopeptide analogues derived from the LCMV glycoprotein peptide 33–41 (GP33) in which one CO–NH amide bond at a time was replaced by a reduced peptide bond Ψ(CH2–NH) in the native sequence. GP33 is presented by H-2Db MHC molecules and recognized in this context by specific CD8+ T cells. This model was particularly interesting for at least three reasons. First, although infection with cytopathic viruses (e.g. vaccina, vesicular stomatis, Semliki Forest, or influenza virus) is controlled by soluble mediators such as antibodies and cytokines, T cell-mediated cytotoxicity is crucial for the resolution of infections with noncytopathic viruses such as LCMV (31Kägi D. Hengartner H. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1996; 8: 472-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). LCMV is thus an excellent model to study in vivo the efficacy of the CTL response induced by modified peptides. Second, it is known that although the parent peptide GP33 is particularly efficient to induce protection against a viral challenge when it is injected in the presence of IFA, this peptide is unable to generate protection when used in saline solution. Third, a transgenic model containing within the CD8+ T cell population 40–60% transgenic TCR+ (Vα2/Vβ8) T cells specific for peptide GP33 presented in the H-2Db MHC context is available (27Battegay M. Cooper S. Althage A. Baenziger J. Hengartner H. Zinkernagel R. Pircher H. J. Virol. Methods. 1991; 33: 191-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar), thus allowing in vivo study of the recognition of the peptide (or pseudopeptide)-MHC complexes by this TCR.Two of eight analogues studied, namely Ψ(5–6) and Ψ(6–7), were able to bind to H-2Db molecules with an apparent affinity similar to that of the parent GP33 peptide. Guichard et al.(7Guichard G. Calbo S. Muller S. Kourilsky P. Briand J.-P. Abastado J.-P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26057-26059Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) previously found that five of eight reduced peptide bond analogues derived from a Plasmodium berghei MHC class I epitope could bind to soluble recombinant H-2Kd molecules. However, the relative affinity of these pseudopeptides to MHC molecules was 5–10-fold lower than that of the parent peptide. The present finding that most of the reduced peptide bond analogues of GP33 exhibited a decreased or no MHC binding capacity correlates with crystallographic data indicating that the peptide backbone plays an important role for binding of peptide to MHC class I molecules (32Young A.C. Zhang W. Sacchettini J.C. Nathenson S.G. Cell. 1994; 76: 39-50Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). It also suggests that in this case, the carbonyl oxygens of the residues in positions 5 and 6 are not essential for peptide-MHC binding.CD8+ T cells from LCMV TCR+ mice recognized equally well the parent GP33 peptide and the Ψ(6–7) analogue. In contrast, they did not recognize the Ψ(5–6) analogue presented in the H-2Db context. This result suggests either that the carbonyl oxygen of the residue in position 5 is directly involved in the interaction with the TCR or that this oxygen atom influences the orientation of the Phe6 side chain that has been shown to be crucial for TCR recognition (23Pircher H. Moskophidis D. Rohrer U. Burki K. Hengartner H. Zinkernagel R.M. Nature. 1990; 346: 629-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar, 33Sebzda E. Kundig T.M. Thomson C.T. Aoki K. Mak S.Y.

Virology. 1997; 234: 62-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar).Because the parent and Ψ(6–7) peptides share similar antigenic properties, the role of their respective susceptibility to proteases in relation to their biological activity could be investigated. We found that the level of GP33 resistance to mouse proteases drastically increased when a single peptide bond located between residues 6 and 7 was replaced by a reduced peptide bond in analogue Ψ(6–7). This result fits well with the observation that a highly protease-sensitive cleavage site is located between positions 6 and 7 in GP33. The detailed molecular mechanisms of GP33 degradation have not yet been elucidated. Cleavage by an endopeptidase remains the most likely possibility, although intervention of carboxypeptidases cannot be excluded. When examined in vivo, the stability of the Ψ(6–7) analogue was also significantly increased. Its half-life in the serum of injected mice was increased by >10 times compared with GP33. The rapid disappearance of GP33 from serum (by renal clearance or most probably as a result of proteolytic degradation), however, may be balanced by the very fast loading of GP33 to MHC molecules from APC. Ten minutes after peptide injection, GP33 (as well as the Ψ(6–7) peptide) was present on splenocytes. This rapid loading of exogenously provided peptides suggests a direct binding to MHC molecules without internalization.In good agreement with previous results (35Romero P. Corradin G. Luescher I.F. Maryanski J.L. J. Exp. Med. 1991; 174: 603-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 36Eberl G. Widmann C. Corradin G. Eur. J. Immunol. 1996; 26: 1993-1999Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), the estimated functional half-life of complexes formed in vivo by H-2Db and GP33 was ∼10–15 h. In the same test, the half-life of the Ψ(6–7)-MHC complexes on APC was increased by a factor of two. Several possibilities may account for this increased stability of Ψ(6–7)-MHC complexes. As shown in a stabilization assay with RMA-S cells, the binding of Ψ(6–7) and GP33 peptides to MHC molecules was similar. Nevertheless, we cannot rule out the possibility that the affinity equilibrium constant of the parent peptide and the Ψ(6–7) analogue to Db molecules are slightly different. A second possibility is that reloading on the cell surface after dissociation from the MHC groove is increased in the case of the Ψ(6–7) analogue because this analogue probably also exhibits an enhanced resistance to proteases present in the extracellular matrix. Finally, it is possible that peptide-MHC complexes are internalized after a few hours, and that because of increased proteolytic resistance to cytoplasmic proteases, the Ψ(6–7) analogue can be reloaded on MHC molecules and represented at the cell surface.Because of the fact that GP33 and Ψ(6–7) are loaded to MHC molecules with a similar initial efficacy, when we assessed the immunogenic activity of the Ψ(6–7) analogue in antiviral protection experiments (peptides injected in IFA), we did not find an improved T cell response to the more stable peptide Ψ(6–7). The pseudopeptide effectively showed antiviral protection properties, which is a novel observation, but these were not significantly different from those observed with GP33. This result suggests that possibly because of the presence of oil in the adjuvant, the advantage of increased proteolytic resistance and prolonged in vivo persistence did not improve the apparent biological activity of the analogue. Furthermore, once peptides are bound to MHC molecules they are apparently protected from digestion (37Mouritsen S. Meldal M. Werdelin O. Hansen A.S. Buus S. J. Immunol. 1992; 149: 1987-1993PubMed Google Scholar). It is known that injection of GP33 inoculated without adjuvant is not able to protect mice from LCMV after challenge infection (Ref. 38Aichele P. Brduscha R.K. Zinkernagel R.M. Hengartner H. Pircher H. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 182: 261-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholarand Fig. 5 B). An important observation shown in this study is that three subcutaneous injections of the free analogue Ψ(6–7) in saline were able to reduce the virus titer in the spleen of immunized mice. This result suggests that Ψ(6–7) but not GP33 is able to prime T cells in the absence of IFA. It remains to be analyzed whether this result is attributable to the higher stability of the Ψ(6–7) analogue in the circulation or to the prolonged half-life of the Ψ(6–7) peptide-MHC complexes. However, the reduction of virus titers obtained with Ψ(6–7) in PBS was not as impressive as observed with peptides in IFA, suggesting the need of an inflammatory process to reach complete antiviral protection. Because our conclusions are of immediate relevance to vaccination, it would be interesting to test the presence and reactivity of memory CD8+ T cells generated after pseudopeptide vaccination. Finally, to better understand the possible mechanisms involved in the clearance of virus by peptide-activated T cells, it will be important to examine the immunological properties of modified peptide ligands containing different types of amide bond isosteric replacements in different viral systems. T cells recognize antigenic peptides in association with MHC1 molecules and play a key role in protection against harmful pathogens and in tumor elimination. Over the past years many attempts have been made to use synthetic peptides as potential vaccines and immunoregulatory agents (1Liu M.A. Nat. Med. 1998; 4 Suppl. 5: 503Google Scholar, 2Stemmer C. Guichard G. Exp. Opin. Ther. Patents. 1998; 8: 819-830Crossref Scopus (1) Google Scholar). Recent studies have provided evidence that pseudopeptides, in which one or several of the natural amide bonds (CO–NH) are replaced by CO–NH isosters (3Gante J. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 1994; 33: 1699-1720Crossref Scopus (883) Google Scholar), can have enhanced antigenic and immunogenic properties (4Guichard G. Benkirane N. Graff R. Muller S. Briand J.-P. Pept.

Most interestingly, it has been shown that such peptide analogues can bind to class I and II MHC molecules (7Guichard G. Calbo S. Muller S. Kourilsky P. Briand J.-P. Abastado J.-P. J. Biol.

Immunol. 1998; 161: 200-208PubMed Google Scholar) similar to those described with altered peptide ligands, which contain single amino acid replacements (15Sloan-Lancaster L.J. Allen P.M. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1995; 7: 103-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). These several recent studies thus demonstrated the potential interest of pseudopeptides as possible therapeutic strategies in T cell-mediated disorders. The high susceptibility of synthetic peptides to proteases is considered to be a major drawback for their use as vaccines or immunoregulatory molecules (16Muller S. Briand J.-P. Res. Immunol. 1998; 149: 55-57Crossref Scopus (2) Google Scholar). We have previously shown that several pseudopeptides with enhanced antigenic activity are more resistant to proteolytic degradation in vitro (5Benkirane N. Guichard G. Briand J.-P. Muller S. J. Biol.

However, no information on in vivo stability of such peptide analogues and the possible direct contribution of this resistance in their ability to modulate the immune response is available. Increased biological activity of protease-resistant pseudopeptide analogues has already been widely shown in other fields of medical chemistry (for review, see Ref. 18Fauchère J.-L. Thurieau C. Adv.

The retro-inverso analogue of the immunostimulatory molecule tuftsin is an outstanding example of a bioactive tetrapeptide for which biological efficiency in vivo has been remarkably increased by introducing one modified peptide bond (22Verdini A.S. Silvestri S. Becherucci C. Longobardi M.G. Parente L. Peppoloni S. Perretti M. Pileri P. Pinori M. Viscomi G.C. Nencioni L. J. Med. Chem. 1991; 34: 3372-3379Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). To examine the possible influence of proteolytic resistance of MHC class I binding peptides on their biological activity, we designed a series of eight reduced peptide bond pseudopeptides of the immunodominant CD8+ T cell epitope of LCMV in C57BL/6 (B6, H-2b) mice. This CTL epitope (called GP33) is located in residues 33–41 of the LCMV glycoprotein (23Pircher H. Moskophidis D. Rohrer U. Burki K. Hengartner H. Zinkernagel R.M. Nature. 1990; 346: 629-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar). We tested the capacity of these eight analogues, each containing one reduced peptide bond Ψ(CH2–NH) at successive positions, to bind to H-2Db MHC molecules. The peptides that bound significantly to H-2Db were further analyzed with respect to their recognition by GP33-specific T cells from a Tg mouse that expresses a H-2Db-restricted T cell receptor specific for this epitope and for their ability to induce antiviral protection. DISCUSSIONThe use of peptides corresponding to MHC class I epitopes to induce a protective CTL response against viruses or tumors is of particular interest in the development of peptide-based vaccines. Recent investigations have suggested that antigenic pseudopeptides containing one or several peptide bond isosters might advantageously replace natural peptides in therapeutic strategies because they can bind to MHC class I molecules and generate an efficient T cell response (7Guichard G.

Hoebeke J. Choppin J. Briand J.-P. Guillet J.-G. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 200-208PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, we have examined the antigenic and immunogenic properties of pseudopeptide analogues derived from the LCMV glycoprotein peptide 33–41 (GP33) in which one CO–NH amide bond at a time was replaced by a reduced peptide bond Ψ(CH2–NH) in the native sequence. GP33 is presented by H-2Db MHC molecules and recognized in this context by specific CD8+ T cells. This model was particularly interesting for at least three reasons. First, although infection with cytopathic viruses (e.g. vaccina, vesicular stomatis, Semliki Forest, or influenza virus) is controlled by soluble mediators such as antibodies and cytokines, T cell-mediated cytotoxicity is crucial for the resolution of infections with noncytopathic viruses such as LCMV (31Kägi D. Hengartner H. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1996; 8: 472-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). LCMV is thus an excellent model to study in vivo the efficacy of the CTL response induced by modified peptides. Second, it is known that although the parent peptide GP33 is particularly efficient to induce protection against a viral challenge when it is injected in the presence of IFA, this peptide is unable to generate protection when used in saline solution. Third, a transgenic model containing within the CD8+ T cell population 40–60% transgenic TCR+ (Vα2/Vβ8) T cells specific for peptide GP33 presented in the H-2Db MHC context is available (27Battegay M. Cooper S. Althage A. Baenziger J. Hengartner H. Zinkernagel R. Pircher H. J. Virol. Methods. 1991; 33: 191-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar), thus allowing in vivo study of the recognition of the peptide (or pseudopeptide)-MHC complexes by this TCR.Two of eight analogues studied, namely Ψ(5–6) and Ψ(6–7), were able to bind to H-2Db molecules with an apparent affinity similar to that of the parent GP33 peptide. Guichard et al.(7Guichard G. Calbo S. Muller S. Kourilsky P. Briand J.-P. Abastado J.-P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26057-26059Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) previously found that five of eight reduced peptide bond analogues derived from a Plasmodium berghei MHC class I epitope could bind to soluble recombinant H-2Kd molecules. However, the relative affinity of these pseudopeptides to MHC molecules was 5–10-fold lower than that of the parent peptide. The present finding that most of the reduced peptide bond analogues of GP33 exhibited a decreased or no MHC binding capacity correlates with crystallographic data indicating that the peptide backbone plays an important role for binding of peptide to MHC class I molecules (32Young A.C. Zhang W. Sacchettini J.C. Nathenson S.G. Cell. 1994; 76: 39-50Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). It also suggests that in this case, the carbonyl oxygens of the residues in positions 5 and 6 are not essential for peptide-MHC binding.CD8+ T cells from LCMV TCR+ mice recognized equally well the parent GP33 peptide and the Ψ(6–7) analogue. In contrast, they did not recognize the Ψ(5–6) analogue presented in the H-2Db context. This result suggests either that the carbonyl oxygen of the residue in position 5 is directly involved in the interaction with the TCR or that this oxygen atom influences the orientation of the Phe6 side chain that has been shown to be crucial for TCR recognition (23Pircher H. Moskophidis D. Rohrer U. Burki K. Hengartner H. Zinkernagel R.M. Nature. 1990; 346: 629-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar, 33Sebzda E. Kundig T.M. Thomson C.T. Aoki K. Mak S.Y.

Virology. 1997; 234: 62-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar).Because the parent and Ψ(6–7) peptides share similar antigenic properties, the role of their respective susceptibility to proteases in relation to their biological activity could be investigated. We found that the level of GP33 resistance to mouse proteases drastically increased when a single peptide bond located between residues 6 and 7 was replaced by a reduced peptide bond in analogue Ψ(6–7). This result fits well with the observation that a highly protease-sensitive cleavage site is located between positions 6 and 7 in GP33. The detailed molecular mechanisms of GP33 degradation have not yet been elucidated. Cleavage by an endopeptidase remains the most likely possibility, although intervention of carboxypeptidases cannot be excluded. When examined in vivo, the stability of the Ψ(6–7) analogue was also significantly increased. Its half-life in the serum of injected mice was increased by >10 times compared with GP33. The rapid disappearance of GP33 from serum (by renal clearance or most probably as a result of proteolytic degradation), however, may be balanced by the very fast loading of GP33 to MHC molecules from APC. Ten minutes after peptide injection, GP33 (as well as the Ψ(6–7) peptide) was present on splenocytes. This rapid loading of exogenously provided peptides suggests a direct binding to MHC molecules without internalization.In good agreement with previous results (35Romero P. Corradin G. Luescher I.F. Maryanski J.L. J. Exp. Med. 1991; 174: 603-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 36Eberl G. Widmann C. Corradin G. Eur. J. Immunol. 1996; 26: 1993-1999Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), the estimated functional half-life of complexes formed in vivo by H-2Db and GP33 was ∼10–15 h. In the same test, the half-life of the Ψ(6–7)-MHC complexes on APC was increased by a factor of two. Several possibilities may account for this increased stability of Ψ(6–7)-MHC complexes. As shown in a stabilization assay with RMA-S cells, the binding of Ψ(6–7) and GP33 peptides to MHC molecules was similar. Nevertheless, we cannot rule out the possibility that the affinity equilibrium constant of the parent peptide and the Ψ(6–7) analogue to Db molecules are slightly different. A second possibility is that reloading on the cell surface after dissociation from the MHC groove is increased in the case of the Ψ(6–7) analogue because this analogue probably also exhibits an enhanced resistance to proteases present in the extracellular matrix. Finally, it is possible that peptide-MHC complexes are internalized after a few hours, and that because of increased proteolytic resistance to cytoplasmic proteases, the Ψ(6–7) analogue can be reloaded on MHC molecules and represented at the cell surface.Because of the fact that GP33 and Ψ(6–7) are loaded to MHC molecules with a similar initial efficacy, when we assessed the immunogenic activity of the Ψ(6–7) analogue in antiviral protection experiments (peptides injected in IFA), we did not find an improved T cell response to the more stable peptide Ψ(6–7). The pseudopeptide effectively showed antiviral protection properties, which is a novel observation, but these were not significantly different from those observed with GP33. This result suggests that possibly because of the presence of oil in the adjuvant, the advantage of increased proteolytic resistance and prolonged in vivo persistence did not improve the apparent biological activity of the analogue. Furthermore, once peptides are bound to MHC molecules they are apparently protected from digestion (37Mouritsen S. Meldal M. Werdelin O. Hansen A.S. Buus S. J. Immunol. 1992; 149: 1987-1993PubMed Google Scholar). It is known that injection of GP33 inoculated without adjuvant is not able to protect mice from LCMV after challenge infection (Ref. 38Aichele P. Brduscha R.K. Zinkernagel R.M. Hengartner H. Pircher H. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 182: 261-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholarand Fig. 5 B). An important observation shown in this study is that three subcutaneous injections of the free analogue Ψ(6–7) in saline were able to reduce the virus titer in the spleen of immunized mice. This result suggests that Ψ(6–7) but not GP33 is able to prime T cells in the absence of IFA. It remains to be analyzed whether this result is attributable to the higher stability of the Ψ(6–7) analogue in the circulation or to the prolonged half-life of the Ψ(6–7) peptide-MHC complexes. However, the reduction of virus titers obtained with Ψ(6–7) in PBS was not as impressive as observed with peptides in IFA, suggesting the need of an inflammatory process to reach complete antiviral protection. Because our conclusions are of immediate relevance to vaccination, it would be interesting to test the presence and reactivity of memory CD8+ T cells generated after pseudopeptide vaccination.

However, the relative affinity of these pseudopeptides to MHC molecules was 5–10-fold lower than that of the parent peptide. The present finding that most of the reduced peptide bond analogues of GP33 exhibited a decreased or no MHC binding capacity correlates with crystallographic data indicating that the peptide backbone plays an important role for binding of peptide to MHC class I molecules (32Young A.C. Zhang W. Sacchettini J.C. Nathenson S.G. Cell. 1994; 76: 39-50Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). It also suggests that in this case, the carbonyl oxygens of the residues in positions 5 and 6 are not essential for peptide-MHC binding. CD8+ T cells from LCMV TCR+ mice recognized equally well the parent GP33 peptide and the Ψ(6–7) analogue. In contrast, they did not recognize the Ψ(5–6) analogue presented in the H-2Db context. This result suggests either that the carbonyl oxygen of the residue in position 5 is directly involved in the interaction with the TCR or that this oxygen atom influences the orientation of the Phe6 side chain that has been shown to be crucial for TCR recognition (23Pircher H. Moskophidis D. Rohrer U. Burki K. Hengartner H. Zinkernagel R.M. Nature. 1990; 346: 629-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar, 33Sebzda E. Kundig T.M. Thomson C.T. Aoki K. Mak S.Y.

Virology. 1997; 234: 62-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Because the parent and Ψ(6–7) peptides share similar antigenic properties, the role of their respective susceptibility to proteases in relation to their biological activity could be investigated. We found that the level of GP33 resistance to mouse proteases drastically increased when a single peptide bond located between residues 6 and 7 was replaced by a reduced peptide bond in analogue Ψ(6–7). This result fits well with the observation that a highly protease-sensitive cleavage site is located between positions 6 and 7 in GP33. The detailed molecular mechanisms of GP33 degradation have not yet been elucidated. Cleavage by an endopeptidase remains the most likely possibility, although intervention of carboxypeptidases cannot be excluded. When examined in vivo, the stability of the Ψ(6–7) analogue was also significantly increased. Its half-life in the serum of injected mice was increased by >10 times compared with GP33. The rapid disappearance of GP33 from serum (by renal clearance or most probably as a result of proteolytic degradation), however, may be balanced by the very fast loading of GP33 to MHC molecules from APC. Ten minutes after peptide injection, GP33 (as well as the Ψ(6–7) peptide) was present on splenocytes. This rapid loading of exogenously provided peptides suggests a direct binding to MHC molecules without internalization. In good agreement with previous results (35Romero P. Corradin G. Luescher I.F. Maryanski J.L. J. Exp. Med. 1991; 174: 603-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 36Eberl G. Widmann C. Corradin G. Eur. J. Immunol. 1996; 26: 1993-1999Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), the estimated functional half-life of complexes formed in vivo by H-2Db and GP33 was ∼10–15 h. In the same test, the half-life of the Ψ(6–7)-MHC complexes on APC was increased by a factor of two. Several possibilities may account for this increased stability of Ψ(6–7)-MHC complexes. As shown in a stabilization assay with RMA-S cells, the binding of Ψ(6–7) and GP33 peptides to MHC molecules was similar. Nevertheless, we cannot rule out the possibility that the affinity equilibrium constant of the parent peptide and the Ψ(6–7) analogue to Db molecules are slightly different. A second possibility is that reloading on the cell surface after dissociation from the MHC groove is increased in the case of the Ψ(6–7) analogue because this analogue probably also exhibits an enhanced resistance to proteases present in the extracellular matrix. Finally, it is possible that peptide-MHC complexes are internalized after a few hours, and that because of increased proteolytic resistance to cytoplasmic proteases, the Ψ(6–7) analogue can be reloaded on MHC molecules and represented at the cell surface. Because of the fact that GP33 and Ψ(6–7) are loaded to MHC molecules with a similar initial efficacy, when we assessed the immunogenic activity of the Ψ(6–7) analogue in antiviral protection experiments (peptides injected in IFA), we did not find an improved T cell response to the more stable peptide Ψ(6–7). The pseudopeptide effectively showed antiviral protection properties, which is a novel observation, but these were not significantly different from those observed with GP33. This result suggests that possibly because of the presence of oil in the adjuvant, the advantage of increased proteolytic resistance and prolonged in vivo persistence did not improve the apparent biological activity of the analogue. Furthermore, once peptides are bound to MHC molecules they are apparently protected from digestion (37Mouritsen S. Meldal M. Werdelin O. Hansen A.S. Buus S. J. Immunol. 1992; 149: 1987-1993PubMed Google Scholar). It is known that injection of GP33 inoculated without adjuvant is not able to protect mice from LCMV after challenge infection (Ref. 38Aichele P. Brduscha R.K. Zinkernagel R.M. Hengartner H. Pircher H. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 182: 261-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholarand Fig. 5 B). An important observation shown in this study is that three subcutaneous injections of the free analogue Ψ(6–7) in saline were able to reduce the virus titer in the spleen of immunized mice. This result suggests that Ψ(6–7) but not GP33 is able to prime T cells in the absence of IFA. It remains to be analyzed whether this result is attributable to the higher stability of the Ψ(6–7) analogue in the circulation or to the prolonged half-life of the Ψ(6–7) peptide-MHC complexes. However, the reduction of virus titers obtained with Ψ(6–7) in PBS was not as impressive as observed with peptides in IFA, suggesting the need of an inflammatory process to reach complete antiviral protection. Because our conclusions are of immediate relevance to vaccination, it would be interesting to test the presence and reactivity of memory CD8+ T cells generated after pseudopeptide vaccination. Finally, to better understand the possible mechanisms involved in the clearance of virus by peptide-activated T cells, it will be important to examine the immunological properties of modified peptide ligands containing different types of amide bond isosteric replacements in different viral systems.

In this report, we demonstrated that the HOXB7 homeodomain-containing protein, which plays a key role in development and differentiation, physically interacted in vitro with IκB-α, an inhibitor of NF-κB activity. This interaction was mediated by the IκB-α ankyrin repeats and C-terminal domain as well as by the HOXB7 N-terminal domain. In transient transfection experiments, IκB-α markedly increased HOXB7-dependent transcription from a reporter plasmid containing a homeodomain consensus-binding sequence.

These protein-protein interactions modulate the activating or repressing abilities of the complexes. The identification of all the partners interacting with a transcription factor is thus essential for the understanding of its biological functions.Homeodomain-containing proteins are transcription factors that play a crucial role in the development of many species, including humans (1Levine M. Rubin G.M. Tjian R. Cell. 1984; 38: 667-673Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 2Levine M. Hoey T.

Hum. Reprod. 1997; 3: 115-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). They share a highly conserved 60-amino acid DNA-binding domain, the homeodomain, and control the expression of many target genes, most of which remain unknown (5Gehring W.J. Affolter M. Bürglin T. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 487-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (846) Google Scholar). These proteins are encoded by 39HOX genes, which are organized in four clusters (loci A, B, C, and D) located on chromosomes 7, 17, 12, and 2, respectively (6Acampora D. D'Esposito M. Faiella A. Pannese M. Migliacco E. Morelli F. Stornaiuolo A. Nigro V. Simeone A. Boncinelli E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 10385-10402Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Interestingly, their pattern of expression along the anteroposterior axis of the developing embryo is closely related to their chromosomal position on the cluster (7Graham A. Papalopupu N. Krumlauf R. Cell. 1989; 57: 367-378Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (746) Google Scholar), defining a “spatial colinearity.” Although homologous recombination experiments have clearly demonstrated their in vivo specificity, all the HOX gene products bind to very similar sequences in vitro (8Kalionis B. O'Farrell P.H. Mech. Dev. 1993; 43: 57-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 9Pellerin I. Schnabel C. Catron K.M. Abate C. Mol. Cell.

A. 1994; 91: 118-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Their specificity may thus be achieved not only through DNA-protein interactions but also through protein-protein interactions with other transcription factors whose identities remain largely unknown. Among these partners, the extradenticle/Pbxhomeodomain-containing proteins were the first to be identified as co-factors for HOX proteins (11Chang C.-P. Shen W.-F. Rozenfeld S. Lawrence H.J. Largman C. Clearly M. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 663-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). Interaction with the PBX protein requires the pentapeptide, a conserved domain located upstream of the DNA-binding domain of most HOX gene products and required for the interactions of HOX proteins with other peptides (11Chang C.-P. Shen W.-F. Rozenfeld S. Lawrence H.J. Largman C. Clearly M. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 663-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar), as well as the HOX cooperativity motif, a sequence C-terminal to the Pbx homeodomain (12Chang C.-P. De Vito I. Clearly M.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 81-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Because AbdB-like HOX proteins do not harbor any pentapeptide-like sequence, they cannot interact with Pbx proteins (13Shen W.-F. Montgomery J.C. Rozenfeld S. Moskow J.J. Jeffrey Lawrence H. Buchberg A.M. Largman C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6448-6458Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar), thus suggesting that other partners might be involved. Indeed, a recent report has illustrated the existence of heterodimeric complexes between HOX and Meis1 proteins (13Shen W.-F. Montgomery J.C. Rozenfeld S. Moskow J.J. Jeffrey Lawrence H. Buchberg A.M. Largman C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6448-6458Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Moreover, it is likely that other proteins yet to be identified also interact with HOX proteins and contribute to their biological function.HOXB7 cDNA was initially isolated from an SV40-transformed human fibroblast cDNA library (14Simeone A. Mavilio F. Acampora D. Giampaolo A. Paiella A. Zappavigna V. D'Esposito M. Pannese M. Russo G. Boncinelli E. Peschle C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 4914-4918Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The HOXB7 protein is involved in a variety of developmental processes, including hematopoietic differentiation and lymphoid development (15Shen W.-f. Largman C. Lowney P. Corral J.C. Detmer K. Hauser C.A. Simonitch T.A. Hack F.M. Lawrence H.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 8536-8540Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 16Deguchi Y. Moroney J.F. Kehrl J.

Because of its expression in lymphoid and nonlymphoid cells, the HOXB7 protein might be involved in the regulation of a common transcriptional event rather than in lineage-specific gene expression (18Baier L.J. Hannibal M.C. Hanley E.W. Nabel G.J. Blood. 1991; 78: 1047-1055Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, despite the demonstration of HOXB7 protein binding to DNA (19Corsetti M.T. Briata P. Sanseverino L. Daga A. Airoldi I. Simeone A. Palmisano G. Angelini C. Boncinelli E. Corte G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 4465-4472Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), little is known about its transcriptional properties and interacting partnersin vivo. We first demonstrated that the HOXB7 protein as well as a naturally occurring mutant harboring a truncated C-terminal tail both transactivate from a HOX-binding consensus sequence in breast cancer cells (20Chariot A. Senterre-Lesenfants S. Sobel M.E. Castronovo V. J. Cell. Biochem. 1998; 71: 46-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) and physically interact with the coactivator CREB-binding protein. 1A.

Indeed, these transcription factors are activated in response to a variety of extracellular signals such as phorbol esters, tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin-1, lipopolysaccharide, UV irradiation, viral infection, and growth factors (24Ghosh S. May M.J. Kopp E.B. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 225-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (4572) Google Scholar, 25Beg A.A. Finco T. Nantermet P. Baldwin A. Mol. Cell.

Immunol. 1994; 12: 141-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (4582) Google Scholar). In unstimulated cells, NF-κB activity is inhibited by another class of proteins that includes IκB-α (27Baeuerle P.A. Baltimore D. Science. 1988; 242: 540-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (1678) Google Scholar, 28Haskill S. Beg A.A. Tompkins S.M. Morris J.S. Yurochko A.D. Sampson-Johanne A. Mondal K. Ralph P. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Cell. 1991; 65: 1281-1289Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar), IκB-β (29Thompson J.E. Phillips R.J. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Ghosh S. Cell. 1995; 80: 573-582Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (692) Google Scholar), IκB-ε (30Whiteside S.T. Epinat J.-C. Rice N.R. Israel A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1413-1426Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar), p105, and p100. These inhibitory proteins all share ankyrin repeats, sequester the NF-κB complexes in the cytoplasm, and block their binding to κB DNA sequences. Initially described as a cytoplasmic protein (28Haskill S. Beg A.A. Tompkins S.M. Morris J.S. Yurochko A.D. Sampson-Johanne A. Mondal K. Ralph P. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Cell. 1991; 65: 1281-1289Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar), IκB-α has since been detected in the nucleus of transfected Vero cells (31Zabel U. Henkel T. Silva M.D.S. Baeuerle P. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 201-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar) as well as after serum stimulation (32Cressman D.E. Taub R. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 2567-2573PubMed Google Scholar). The nuclear localization of IκB-α is mediated by its second ankyrin repeat, which acts as a nuclear import sequence (33Sachdev S. Hoffmann A. Hannink M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2524-2534Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Once in the nucleus, IκB-α can remove NF-κB dimers from their κB DNA sequences, thus inhibiting NF-κB activity (34Arenzana-Seisdedos F. Thompson J. Rodriguez M.S. Bachelerie F. Thomas D. Hay R.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2689-2696Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). When fused to the GAL-4 DNA-binding domain, IκB-α displays transactivation abilities (35Morin P.J. Gilmore T.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 2452-2458Crossref Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 36Morin P.J. Subramanian G.S. Gilmore T.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 2157-2163Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), a property not possessed by the naturally occurring IκB-α protein (32Cressman D.E. Taub R. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 2567-2573PubMed Google Scholar). These results raised the possibility that IκB-α can interact with other transcription factors and modulate their activity.In this report, we demonstrated that IκB-α is able to physically interact with the HOXB7 homeodomain-containing protein and to enhance HOXB7 transcriptional activity. We further identified HOXB7 and IκB-α domains involved in this interaction. Our results thus demonstrate a novel function of IκB-α.DISCUSSIONThis report has demonstrated a physical interaction between the HOXB7 homeodomain-containing protein and IκB-α, resulting in an enhanced transactivation by this HOX gene product. Moreover, we identified the HOXB7 and IκB-α functional domains mediating this interaction. These results provide new insights into the transcription properties of the homeodomain-containing proteins and reveal a novel function of the inhibitor IκB-α.All the homeodomain-containing proteins encoded by the 39HOX genes share a highly conserved 60-amino acid DNA-binding domain, the homeodomain, and bind to very similar sequences in vitro (8Kalionis B. O'Farrell P.H. Mech. Dev. 1993; 43: 57-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 9Pellerin I. Schnabel C. Catron K.M. Abate C. Mol. Cell.

A. 1994; 91: 118-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Their in vivo specificity may thus involve protein-protein interactions with other transcription factors. In this context, the homeodomain proteins derived from theextradenticle/Pbx genes act as co-factors forHOX gene products that contain a pentapeptide sequence (11Chang C.-P. Shen W.-F. Rozenfeld S. Lawrence H.J. Largman C. Clearly M. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 663-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar), whereas the AbdB-like HOX proteins, which do not harbor a pentapeptide, interact with Meis1 (13Shen W.-F. Montgomery J.C. Rozenfeld S. Moskow J.J. Jeffrey Lawrence H. Buchberg A.M. Largman C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6448-6458Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). We have provided here evidence that the NF-κB proteins, including the p50-p65 heterodimer, can enhance the transcription potential of the HOXB7 protein in transient expression experiments. This effect is presumably mediated by physical interactions between the p50-p65 complex and HOXB7. Preliminaryin vitro experiments have indeed confirmed this hypothesis (data not shown). It is tempting to speculate the existence of a p50-p65-HOXB7 complex that could bind the CBS consensus sequence and transactivate through the HOXB7 and p65 activation domains. This complex, however, did not display a similar effect on a κB-binding site under our experimental conditions.We have shown that the inhibitor IκB-α can enhance the HOXB7 transactivating effect. This is the first demonstration that IκB-α interacts with proteins from other families of transcription factors. Previous reports had demonstrated that IκB-α can translocate to the nucleus, using its second ankyrin repeat as a nuclear import sequence (33Sachdev S. Hoffmann A. Hannink M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2524-2534Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and subsequently remove the NF-κB complex from its binding site (34Arenzana-Seisdedos F. Thompson J. Rodriguez M.S. Bachelerie F. Thomas D. Hay R.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2689-2696Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, IκB-β can repress the 9-cis-retinoic acid-induced transcriptional activity of retinoid X receptor in lipopolysaccharide-treated cells (43Na S.-Y. Kim H.-J. Lee S.-K. Choi H.-S. Na D.-S. Lee M.-O. Chung M. Moore D.D. Lee J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3212-3215Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Thus, in both cases, IκB proteins localized in the nucleus negatively regulate the transcriptional activity of their interacting partners. Surprisingly, our study demonstrates that IκB-α can also positively regulate the transcriptional properties of a homeodomain-containing protein. A similar phenomenon was described previously for Bcl3, another member of the IκB protein family. Indeed, Bcl3 can transactivate through κB sites when physically associated with p52 and p50 (37Bours V. Franzoso G. Azarenko V. Park S. Kanno T. Brown K. Siebenlist U. Cell. 1993; 72: 729-739Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar, 44Fujita T. Nolan G.P. Liou H.-C. Scott M.L. Baltimore D. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1354-1363Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar), and it has been demonstrated that the N- and C-terminal domains of Bcl3 are transcriptional activation domains (37Bours V. Franzoso G. Azarenko V. Park S. Kanno T. Brown K. Siebenlist U. Cell. 1993; 72: 729-739Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). Moreover, Bcl3, but not IκB-β, can also act as a coactivator of the retinoid X receptor (45Na S.-Y. Choi H.-S. Kim J.W. Na DS. Lee J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30933-30938Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). These results and the present report strongly suggest that distinct IκB proteins can modulate, positively as well as negatively, the transcriptional properties of their interacting partners, including transcription factors that do not belong to the NF-κB family.Interestingly, we demonstrated that both the IκB-α ankyrin and C-terminal domains mediate interaction with HOXB7. The same domains are also required for the regulation of c-Rel by IκB-α in the nucleus (46Luque I. Gélinas C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1213-1224Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Taken together, these results suggest a critical role for the ankyrin repeats and C-terminal domains in the function of IκB-α in the nucleus.Several models, which are not mutually exclusive, can explain how IκB-α enhances HOXB7 transcriptional activity (Fig.9). The first model does not imply a direct interaction between HOXB7 and IκB-α but rather an indirect mechanism mediated by NF-κB. Indeed, we can postulate that NF-κB activates the expression of HOX genes encoding repressors. Therefore, NF-κB inhibition by IκB-α would lead to a decreased expression of these HOX genes and to increased luciferase activity in transient expression experiments (Fig. 9 A). This first model is the only one that does not require IκB-α nuclear localization. The second model is based on a report demonstrating that ankyrin repeats stabilize the DNA binding of other transcription factors (47Batchelor A.H. Piper D.E. de la Brousse F.C. McKnight S.L. Wolberger C. Science. 1998; 279: 1037-1041Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). The enhanced HOXB7 transcriptional activity would then be mediated by a stronger HOXB7 DNA binding affinity for its target sequence in the presence of IκB-α (Fig. 9 B). This hypothesis is supported by the observation that the physical interaction between HOXB7 and IκB-α requires the ankyrin repeats. In the third model, a HOXB7-IκB-α complex is bound to the CBS sequence through the HOXB7 homeodomain and transactivates through IκB-α. This hypothesis is supported by previous studies demonstrating that IκB-α can transactivate when fused to a GAL4 DNA-binding domain (35Morin P.J. Gilmore T.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 2452-2458Crossref Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 36Morin P.J. Subramanian G.S. Gilmore T.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 2157-2163Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Moreover, Bcl3, another member of the IκB-α family, also harbors transactivating domains (37Bours V. Franzoso G. Azarenko V. Park S. Kanno T. Brown K. Siebenlist U. Cell. 1993; 72: 729-739Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). The fourth model implies a HOXB7-RelA-IκB-α complex activating the luciferase gene through both the HOXB7 and RelA transactivation domains. The last two hypotheses are supported by the induction of luciferase activity observed with IκB-α and B7ΔC12 expression vectors, whereas the B7ΔC12 protein is not able to transactivate by itself but can physically interact with IκB-α. However, the last model cannot account for the fact that the transcriptional activity was higher after transfection of the HOXB7 and IκB-α expression vectors than in the presence of the same vectors plus RelA (Fig. 2). Further experiments are required to determine which of these models is correct. Unfortunately, the available HOXB7 antibodies did not allow us to study more precisely the HOXB7 multimeric complexes in transfected or unmodified cells.The functional link between NF-κB-IκB-α and homeodomain proteins was unexpected because of the distinct physiological processes they control. However, a first link between these two families during the outgrowth of the vertebrate limb has recently been described (48Bushdid P.B. Brantley D.M. Yull F.E. Blaeuer G.L. Hoffman L.H. Niswander L. Kerr L.D. Nature. 1998; 392: 615-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 49Kanegae Y. Tavares A.T. Izpisùa Belmonte J.C. Verma I.M. Nature. 1998; 392: 611-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Indeed, NF-κB gene expression has been detected during limb morphogenesis and the alteration of NF-κB activity causes an arrest of the outgrowth (48Bushdid P.B. Brantley D.M. Yull F.E. Blaeuer G.L. Hoffman L.H. Niswander L. Kerr L.D. Nature. 1998; 392: 615-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 49Kanegae Y. Tavares A.T. Izpisùa Belmonte J.C. Verma I.M. Nature. 1998; 392: 611-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Moreover, IκB-α is the human homologue of cactus, a protein that plays a crucial role in the dorsoventral patterning of the Drosophila embryo (21Geisler R. Bergmann A. Hiromi Y. Nusslein-Volhard C. Cell. 1992; 71: 613-621Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Because HOX genes are clearly required to establish the anteroposterior axis of the developing embryo, it is tempting to speculate that the interaction between IκB-α and HOX proteins might determine the antero-posterior and dorsoventral polarities of the embryo. Multiple transcription factors establish combinatorial interactions to achieve their in vivo specificity. These protein-protein interactions modulate the activating or repressing abilities of the complexes. The identification of all the partners interacting with a transcription factor is thus essential for the understanding of its biological functions. Homeodomain-containing proteins are transcription factors that play a crucial role in the development of many species, including humans (1Levine M. Rubin G.M. Tjian R. Cell. 1984; 38: 667-673Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 2Levine M. Hoey T. Cell. 1988; 55: 537-540Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar, 3Akam M. Cell. 1989; 57: 347-349Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar, 4Favier B. Dollé P. Mol. Hum. Reprod. 1997; 3: 115-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). They share a highly conserved 60-amino acid DNA-binding domain, the homeodomain, and control the expression of many target genes, most of which remain unknown (5Gehring W.J. Affolter M. Bürglin T. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 487-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (846) Google Scholar). These proteins are encoded by 39HOX genes, which are organized in four clusters (loci A, B, C, and D) located on chromosomes 7, 17, 12, and 2, respectively (6Acampora D. D'Esposito M. Faiella A. Pannese M. Migliacco E. Morelli F. Stornaiuolo A. Nigro V. Simeone A. Boncinelli E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 10385-10402Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Interestingly, their pattern of expression along the anteroposterior axis of the developing embryo is closely related to their chromosomal position on the cluster (7Graham A. Papalopupu N. Krumlauf R. Cell. 1989; 57: 367-378Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (746) Google Scholar), defining a “spatial colinearity.” Although homologous recombination experiments have clearly demonstrated their in vivo specificity, all the HOX gene products bind to very similar sequences in vitro (8Kalionis B. O'Farrell P.H. Mech. Dev. 1993; 43: 57-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 9Pellerin I. Schnabel C. Catron K.M. Abate C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4532-4545Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 10Shang Z. Ebright Y.M. Iler N. Shannon Pendergrast P. Echelard Y. McMahon A.P. Ebright R.H. Abate C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 118-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Their specificity may thus be achieved not only through DNA-protein interactions but also through protein-protein interactions with other transcription factors whose identities remain largely unknown. Among these partners, the extradenticle/Pbxhomeodomain-containing proteins were the first to be identified as co-factors for HOX proteins (11Chang C.-P. Shen W.-F. Rozenfeld S. Lawrence H.J. Largman C. Clearly M. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 663-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). Interaction with the PBX protein requires the pentapeptide, a conserved domain located upstream of the DNA-binding domain of most HOX gene products and required for the interactions of HOX proteins with other peptides (11Chang C.-P. Shen W.-F. Rozenfeld S. Lawrence H.J. Largman C. Clearly M. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 663-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar), as well as the HOX cooperativity motif, a sequence C-terminal to the Pbx homeodomain (12Chang C.-P. De Vito I. Clearly M.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 81-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Because AbdB-like HOX proteins do not harbor any pentapeptide-like sequence, they cannot interact with Pbx proteins (13Shen W.-F. Montgomery J.C. Rozenfeld S. Moskow J.J. Jeffrey Lawrence H. Buchberg A.M. Largman C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6448-6458Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar), thus suggesting that other partners might be involved. Indeed, a recent report has illustrated the existence of heterodimeric complexes between HOX and Meis1 proteins (13Shen W.-F. Montgomery J.C. Rozenfeld S. Moskow J.J. Jeffrey Lawrence H. Buchberg A.M. Largman C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6448-6458Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Moreover, it is likely that other proteins yet to be identified also interact with HOX proteins and contribute to their biological function. HOXB7 cDNA was initially isolated from an SV40-transformed human fibroblast cDNA library (14Simeone A. Mavilio F. Acampora D. Giampaolo A. Paiella A. Zappavigna V. D'Esposito M. Pannese M. Russo G. Boncinelli E. Peschle C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 4914-4918Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The HOXB7 protein is involved in a variety of developmental processes, including hematopoietic differentiation and lymphoid development (15Shen W.-f. Largman C. Lowney P. Corral J.C. Detmer K. Hauser C.A. Simonitch T.A. Hack F.M. Lawrence H.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 8536-8540Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 16Deguchi Y. Moroney J.F. Kehrl J. Blood. 1991; 78: 445-450Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Lill M.C. Fuller J.F. Herzig R. Crooks G.M. Gasson J.C. Blood. 1995; 85: 692-697Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because of its expression in lymphoid and nonlymphoid cells, the HOXB7 protein might be involved in the regulation of a common transcriptional event rather than in lineage-specific gene expression (18Baier L.J. Hannibal M.C. Hanley E.W. Nabel G.J. Blood. 1991; 78: 1047-1055Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, despite the demonstration of HOXB7 protein binding to DNA (19Corsetti M.T. Briata P. Sanseverino L. Daga A. Airoldi I. Simeone A. Palmisano G. Angelini C. Boncinelli E. Corte G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 4465-4472Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), little is known about its transcriptional properties and interacting partnersin vivo. We first demonstrated that the HOXB7 protein as well as a naturally occurring mutant harboring a truncated C-terminal tail both transactivate from a HOX-binding consensus sequence in breast cancer cells (20Chariot A. Senterre-Lesenfants S. Sobel M.E. Castronovo V. J. Cell. Biochem. 1998; 71: 46-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) and physically interact with the coactivator CREB-binding protein. 1A. Chariot, C. van Lint, M. Chapelier, J. Gielen, M.-P. Merville, and V. Bours, submitted for publication. 1A. Chariot, C. van Lint, M. Chapelier, J. Gielen, M.-P. Merville, and V. Bours, submitted for publication. The NF-κB proteins form a family of transcription factors that play a central role in the cellular responses to stress, cytokines, and pathogens (22Siebenlist U. Franzoso F. Brown K. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 405-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (2010) Google Scholar, 23Baldwin A.S. Annu. Rev.

Indeed, these transcription factors are activated in response to a variety of extracellular signals such as phorbol esters, tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin-1, lipopolysaccharide, UV irradiation, viral infection, and growth factors (24Ghosh S. May M.J. Kopp E.B. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 225-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (4572) Google Scholar, 25Beg A.A. Finco T. Nantermet P. Baldwin A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3301-3310Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and regulate a wide spectrum of immune and inflammatory responses (26Baeuerle P.A. Henkel T. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1994; 12: 141-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (4582) Google Scholar). In unstimulated cells, NF-κB activity is inhibited by another class of proteins that includes IκB-α (27Baeuerle P.A. Baltimore D. Science. 1988; 242: 540-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (1678) Google Scholar, 28Haskill S. Beg A.A. Tompkins S.M. Morris J.S. Yurochko A.D. Sampson-Johanne A. Mondal K. Ralph P. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Cell. 1991; 65: 1281-1289Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar), IκB-β (29Thompson J.E. Phillips R.J. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Ghosh S. Cell. 1995; 80: 573-582Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (692) Google Scholar), IκB-ε (30Whiteside S.T. Epinat J.-C. Rice N.R. Israel A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1413-1426Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar), p105, and p100. These inhibitory proteins all share ankyrin repeats, sequester the NF-κB complexes in the cytoplasm, and block their binding to κB DNA sequences. Initially described as a cytoplasmic protein (28Haskill S. Beg A.A. Tompkins S.M. Morris J.S. Yurochko A.D. Sampson-Johanne A. Mondal K. Ralph P. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Cell. 1991; 65: 1281-1289Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar), IκB-α has since been detected in the nucleus of transfected Vero cells (31Zabel U. Henkel T. Silva M.D.S. Baeuerle P. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 201-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar) as well as after serum stimulation (32Cressman D.E. Taub R. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 2567-2573PubMed Google Scholar). The nuclear localization of IκB-α is mediated by its second ankyrin repeat, which acts as a nuclear import sequence (33Sachdev S. Hoffmann A. Hannink M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2524-2534Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Once in the nucleus, IκB-α can remove NF-κB dimers from their κB DNA sequences, thus inhibiting NF-κB activity (34Arenzana-Seisdedos F. Thompson J. Rodriguez M.S. Bachelerie F. Thomas D. Hay R.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2689-2696Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). When fused to the GAL-4 DNA-binding domain, IκB-α displays transactivation abilities (35Morin P.J. Gilmore T.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 2452-2458Crossref Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 36Morin P.J. Subramanian G.S. Gilmore T.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 2157-2163Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), a property not possessed by the naturally occurring IκB-α protein (32Cressman D.E. Taub R. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 2567-2573PubMed Google Scholar). These results raised the possibility that IκB-α can interact with other transcription factors and modulate their activity. In this report, we demonstrated that IκB-α is able to physically interact with the HOXB7 homeodomain-containing protein and to enhance HOXB7 transcriptional activity. We further identified HOXB7 and IκB-α domains involved in this interaction. Our results thus demonstrate a novel function of IκB-α. DISCUSSIONThis report has demonstrated a physical interaction between the HOXB7 homeodomain-containing protein and IκB-α, resulting in an enhanced transactivation by this HOX gene product. Moreover, we identified the HOXB7 and IκB-α functional domains mediating this interaction. These results provide new insights into the transcription properties of the homeodomain-containing proteins and reveal a novel function of the inhibitor IκB-α.All the homeodomain-containing proteins encoded by the 39HOX genes share a highly conserved 60-amino acid DNA-binding domain, the homeodomain, and bind to very similar sequences in vitro (8Kalionis B. O'Farrell P.H. Mech. Dev. 1993; 43: 57-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 9Pellerin I. Schnabel C. Catron K.M. Abate C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4532-4545Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 10Shang Z. Ebright Y.M. Iler N. Shannon Pendergrast P. Echelard Y. McMahon A.P. Ebright R.H. Abate C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 118-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Their in vivo specificity may thus involve protein-protein interactions with other transcription factors. In this context, the homeodomain proteins derived from theextradenticle/Pbx genes act as co-factors forHOX gene products that contain a pentapeptide sequence (11Chang C.-P. Shen W.-F. Rozenfeld S. Lawrence H.J. Largman C. Clearly M. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 663-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar), whereas the AbdB-like HOX proteins, which do not harbor a pentapeptide, interact with Meis1 (13Shen W.-F. Montgomery J.C. Rozenfeld S. Moskow J.J. Jeffrey Lawrence H. Buchberg A.M. Largman C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6448-6458Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). We have provided here evidence that the NF-κB proteins, including the p50-p65 heterodimer, can enhance the transcription potential of the HOXB7 protein in transient expression experiments. This effect is presumably mediated by physical interactions between the p50-p65 complex and HOXB7. Preliminaryin vitro experiments have indeed confirmed this hypothesis (data not shown). It is tempting to speculate the existence of a p50-p65-HOXB7 complex that could bind the CBS consensus sequence and transactivate through the HOXB7 and p65 activation domains. This complex, however, did not display a similar effect on a κB-binding site under our experimental conditions.We have shown that the inhibitor IκB-α can enhance the HOXB7 transactivating effect. This is the first demonstration that IκB-α interacts with proteins from other families of transcription factors. Previous reports had demonstrated that IκB-α can translocate to the nucleus, using its second ankyrin repeat as a nuclear import sequence (33Sachdev S. Hoffmann A. Hannink M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2524-2534Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and subsequently remove the NF-κB complex from its binding site (34Arenzana-Seisdedos F. Thompson J. Rodriguez M.S. Bachelerie F. Thomas D. Hay R.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2689-2696Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, IκB-β can repress the 9-cis-retinoic acid-induced transcriptional activity of retinoid X receptor in lipopolysaccharide-treated cells (43Na S.-Y. Kim H.-J. Lee S.-K. Choi H.-S. Na D.-S. Lee M.-O. Chung M. Moore D.D. Lee J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3212-3215Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Thus, in both cases, IκB proteins localized in the nucleus negatively regulate the transcriptional activity of their interacting partners. Surprisingly, our study demonstrates that IκB-α can also positively regulate the transcriptional properties of a homeodomain-containing protein. A similar phenomenon was described previously for Bcl3, another member of the IκB protein family. Indeed, Bcl3 can transactivate through κB sites when physically associated with p52 and p50 (37Bours V. Franzoso G. Azarenko V. Park S. Kanno T. Brown K. Siebenlist U. Cell. 1993; 72: 729-739Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar, 44Fujita T. Nolan G.P. Liou H.-C. Scott M.L. Baltimore D. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1354-1363Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar), and it has been demonstrated that the N- and C-terminal domains of Bcl3 are transcriptional activation domains (37Bours V. Franzoso G. Azarenko V. Park S. Kanno T. Brown K. Siebenlist U. Cell. 1993; 72: 729-739Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). Moreover, Bcl3, but not IκB-β, can also act as a coactivator of the retinoid X receptor (45Na S.-Y. Choi H.-S. Kim J.W. Na DS. Lee J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30933-30938Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). These results and the present report strongly suggest that distinct IκB proteins can modulate, positively as well as negatively, the transcriptional properties of their interacting partners, including transcription factors that do not belong to the NF-κB family.Interestingly, we demonstrated that both the IκB-α ankyrin and C-terminal domains mediate interaction with HOXB7. The same domains are also required for the regulation of c-Rel by IκB-α in the nucleus (46Luque I. Gélinas C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1213-1224Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Taken together, these results suggest a critical role for the ankyrin repeats and C-terminal domains in the function of IκB-α in the nucleus.Several models, which are not mutually exclusive, can explain how IκB-α enhances HOXB7 transcriptional activity (Fig.9). The first model does not imply a direct interaction between HOXB7 and IκB-α but rather an indirect mechanism mediated by NF-κB. Indeed, we can postulate that NF-κB activates the expression of HOX genes encoding repressors. Therefore, NF-κB inhibition by IκB-α would lead to a decreased expression of these HOX genes and to increased luciferase activity in transient expression experiments (Fig. 9 A). This first model is the only one that does not require IκB-α nuclear localization. The second model is based on a report demonstrating that ankyrin repeats stabilize the DNA binding of other transcription factors (47Batchelor A.H. Piper D.E. de la Brousse F.C. McKnight S.L. Wolberger C. Science. 1998; 279: 1037-1041Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). The enhanced HOXB7 transcriptional activity would then be mediated by a stronger HOXB7 DNA binding affinity for its target sequence in the presence of IκB-α (Fig. 9 B). This hypothesis is supported by the observation that the physical interaction between HOXB7 and IκB-α requires the ankyrin repeats. In the third model, a HOXB7-IκB-α complex is bound to the CBS sequence through the HOXB7 homeodomain and transactivates through IκB-α. This hypothesis is supported by previous studies demonstrating that IκB-α can transactivate when fused to a GAL4 DNA-binding domain (35Morin P.J. Gilmore T.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 2452-2458Crossref Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 36Morin P.J. Subramanian G.S. Gilmore T.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 2157-2163Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Moreover, Bcl3, another member of the IκB-α family, also harbors transactivating domains (37Bours V. Franzoso G. Azarenko V. Park S. Kanno T. Brown K. Siebenlist U. Cell. 1993; 72: 729-739Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). The fourth model implies a HOXB7-RelA-IκB-α complex activating the luciferase gene through both the HOXB7 and RelA transactivation domains. The last two hypotheses are supported by the induction of luciferase activity observed with IκB-α and B7ΔC12 expression vectors, whereas the B7ΔC12 protein is not able to transactivate by itself but can physically interact with IκB-α. However, the last model cannot account for the fact that the transcriptional activity was higher after transfection of the HOXB7 and IκB-α expression vectors than in the presence of the same vectors plus RelA (Fig. 2). Further experiments are required to determine which of these models is correct. Unfortunately, the available HOXB7 antibodies did not allow us to study more precisely the HOXB7 multimeric complexes in transfected or unmodified cells.The functional link between NF-κB-IκB-α and homeodomain proteins was unexpected because of the distinct physiological processes they control. However, a first link between these two families during the outgrowth of the vertebrate limb has recently been described (48Bushdid P.B. Brantley D.M. Yull F.E. Blaeuer G.L. Hoffman L.H. Niswander L.

Cell. 1993; 72: 729-739Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar, 44Fujita T. Nolan G.P. Liou H.-C. Scott M.L. Baltimore D. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1354-1363Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar), and it has been demonstrated that the N- and C-terminal domains of Bcl3 are transcriptional activation domains (37Bours V. Franzoso G. Azarenko V. Park S. Kanno T. Brown K. Siebenlist U. Cell. 1993; 72: 729-739Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). Moreover, Bcl3, but not IκB-β, can also act as a coactivator of the retinoid X receptor (45Na S.-Y. Choi H.-S. Kim J.W. Na DS. Lee J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30933-30938Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). These results and the present report strongly suggest that distinct IκB proteins can modulate, positively as well as negatively, the transcriptional properties of their interacting partners, including transcription factors that do not belong to the NF-κB family. Interestingly, we demonstrated that both the IκB-α ankyrin and C-terminal domains mediate interaction with HOXB7. The same domains are also required for the regulation of c-Rel by IκB-α in the nucleus (46Luque I. Gélinas C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1213-1224Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Taken together, these results suggest a critical role for the ankyrin repeats and C-terminal domains in the function of IκB-α in the nucleus. Several models, which are not mutually exclusive, can explain how IκB-α enhances HOXB7 transcriptional activity (Fig.9). The first model does not imply a direct interaction between HOXB7 and IκB-α but rather an indirect mechanism mediated by NF-κB. Indeed, we can postulate that NF-κB activates the expression of HOX genes encoding repressors. Therefore, NF-κB inhibition by IκB-α would lead to a decreased expression of these HOX genes and to increased luciferase activity in transient expression experiments (Fig. 9 A). This first model is the only one that does not require IκB-α nuclear localization. The second model is based on a report demonstrating that ankyrin repeats stabilize the DNA binding of other transcription factors (47Batchelor A.H. Piper D.E. de la Brousse F.C. McKnight S.L. Wolberger C. Science. 1998; 279: 1037-1041Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). The enhanced HOXB7 transcriptional activity would then be mediated by a stronger HOXB7 DNA binding affinity for its target sequence in the presence of IκB-α (Fig. 9 B). This hypothesis is supported by the observation that the physical interaction between HOXB7 and IκB-α requires the ankyrin repeats. In the third model, a HOXB7-IκB-α complex is bound to the CBS sequence through the HOXB7 homeodomain and transactivates through IκB-α. This hypothesis is supported by previous studies demonstrating that IκB-α can transactivate when fused to a GAL4 DNA-binding domain (35Morin P.J. Gilmore T.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 2452-2458Crossref Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 36Morin P.J. Subramanian G.S. Gilmore T.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 2157-2163Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Moreover, Bcl3, another member of the IκB-α family, also harbors transactivating domains (37Bours V. Franzoso G. Azarenko V. Park S. Kanno T. Brown K. Siebenlist U. Cell. 1993; 72: 729-739Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). The fourth model implies a HOXB7-RelA-IκB-α complex activating the luciferase gene through both the HOXB7 and RelA transactivation domains. The last two hypotheses are supported by the induction of luciferase activity observed with IκB-α and B7ΔC12 expression vectors, whereas the B7ΔC12 protein is not able to transactivate by itself but can physically interact with IκB-α. However, the last model cannot account for the fact that the transcriptional activity was higher after transfection of the HOXB7 and IκB-α expression vectors than in the presence of the same vectors plus RelA (Fig. 2). Further experiments are required to determine which of these models is correct. Unfortunately, the available HOXB7 antibodies did not allow us to study more precisely the HOXB7 multimeric complexes in transfected or unmodified cells. The functional link between NF-κB-IκB-α and homeodomain proteins was unexpected because of the distinct physiological processes they control. However, a first link between these two families during the outgrowth of the vertebrate limb has recently been described (48Bushdid P.B. Brantley D.M. Yull F.E. Blaeuer G.L. Hoffman L.H. Niswander L. Kerr L.D. Nature. 1998; 392: 615-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 49Kanegae Y. Tavares A.T. Izpisùa Belmonte J.C. Verma I.M. Nature. 1998; 392: 611-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Indeed, NF-κB gene expression has been detected during limb morphogenesis and the alteration of NF-κB activity causes an arrest of the outgrowth (48Bushdid P.B. Brantley D.M. Yull F.E. Blaeuer G.L. Hoffman L.H. Niswander L. Kerr L.D. Nature. 1998; 392: 615-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 49Kanegae Y. Tavares A.T. Izpisùa Belmonte J.C. Verma I.M. Nature. 1998; 392: 611-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Moreover, IκB-α is the human homologue of cactus, a protein that plays a crucial role in the dorsoventral patterning of the Drosophila embryo (21Geisler R. Bergmann A. Hiromi Y. Nusslein-Volhard C. Cell. 1992; 71: 613-621Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Because HOX genes are clearly required to establish the anteroposterior axis of the developing embryo, it is tempting to speculate that the interaction between IκB-α and HOX proteins might determine the antero-posterior and dorsoventral polarities of the embryo.

In contrast to other delayed rectifiers, its activation kinetics is largely determined by the holding potential and the concentration of extracellular Mg2+, giving rise to slowly activating currents with a characteristic sigmoidal rising phase. Replacement of a single amino acid in the extracellular linker between transmembrane segments S3 and S4 (L322H) strongly reduced the prepulse dependence and accelerated activation by 1 order of magnitude. In addition, compared with the wild type, the half-activation voltage of this mutant was shifted by more than 30 mV to more negative potentials. We used dimeric and tetrameric constructs of the bovine eag1 gene to analyze channels with defined stoichiometry of mutated and wild-type subunits within the tetrameric channel complexes. With increasing numbers of mutated subunits, the channel activation was progressively accelerated, and the sigmoidicity of the current traces was reduced. Based on a quantitative analysis, we show that the slow gating, typical for EAG channels, is mediated by independent conformational transitions of individual subunits, which gain their voltage dependence from the S4 segment. At a given voltage, external Mg2+ increases the probability of a channel subunit to be in the slowly activating conformation, whereas mutation L322H strongly reduces this probability.

Ionic Channels of Excitable Membranes. 2nd Ed. Sinauer Associates Inc., Sunderland, MA1992Google Scholar). The progress of molecular cloning over the past 10 years revealed an astonishing diversity within this group of membrane proteins, which comprises several related gene families (2Wei A. Jegla T. Salkoff L. Neuropharmacology. 1996; 35: 805-829Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). The ether à go-go gene, which has originally been cloned from Drosophila, provided the name for a growing sub-family of K+ channels that contain six transmembrane segments (S1-S6) per subunit and a binding motif for cyclic nucleotides in the cytoplasmic carboxyl terminus of each subunit. At present this subfamily consists of three members, theeag gene, the eag-like K+ channel gene (elk), and the eag-related gene (erg) (3Warmke J.W. Ganetzky B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3438-3442Crossref PubMed Scopus (866) Google Scholar). Further diversity is caused by splice variants or isoforms that have been described for all three genes (4Shi W. Wang H.S. Pan Z.

Physiol. 1998; 111: 583-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Whereas the ERG channel is responsible for the cardiacI Kr current (8Sanguinetti M.C. Jiang C. Curran M.E. Keating M.T. Cell. 1995; 81: 299-307Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2161) Google Scholar), the physiological role of EAG channels still remains to be identified. Recently the first examples of native EAG currents have been described. A human neuroblastoma cell line was found to express human eag in a cell cycle-dependent manner (9Meyer R. Heinemann S.H. J. Physiol. 1998; 508: 49-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). In human myoblasts, the expression of human eag is correlated with a non-inactivating delayed rectifier K+ current, which is involved in myoblast fusion (10Occhiodoro T. Bernheim L. Liu J.H. Bijlenga P. Sinnreich M. Bader C.R. Fischer-Lougheed J. FEBS Lett. 1998; 434: 177-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). A characteristic feature of all EAG channels that have been examined so far is the unusual kinetics of the activation process. It displays a strong dependence on the prepulse potential (11Ludwig J. Terlau H. Wunder F. Brüggemann A. Pardo L.A. Marquardt A. Stühmer W. Pongs O. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4451-4458Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), reminiscent of the shift originally described by Cole and Moore (12Cole K.S. Moore J.W. Biophys. J. 1960; 1: 1-4Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Test pulses from potentials just below the activation threshold (e.g. −70 mV) lead to rapid activation, whereas hyperpolarizing prepulses result in very slow activation kinetics. Terlau et al. (13Terlau H. Ludwig J. Steffan R. Pongs O. Stühmer W. Heinemann S.H. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1996; 432: 301-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) showed that the slow activation of rat EAG not only occurs at unphysiologically low holding potentials but also under physiological conditions in the presence of extracellular Mg2+ at mm concentrations. The unusual gating of EAG channels was described using a sequential gating model that considered two voltage-dependent transitions for each single subunit (13Terlau H. Ludwig J. Steffan R. Pongs O. Stühmer W. Heinemann S.H. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1996; 432: 301-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The underlying molecular mechanism, however, has not yet been elucidated. In this paper we describe the electrical properties of a point mutation introduced into the bovine eag1 gene. The mutation in the extracellular linker of transmembrane segments S3 and S4 strongly decreased both, the Cole-Moore shift of b-EAG1 activation and the apparent regulation by external Mg2+. We used this mutation as a tool to separate slow and fast gating processes. To control the stoichiometry within the channel tetramers, we constructed dimeric and tetrameric b-eag1 genes with different numbers and orders of the mutated subunits. Using this approach, we could dissect the complex conformational changes in the multimeric channel protein and assign them to gating transitions of individual subunits. The activation kinetics of the linked constructs could be described by a fully independent model, assuming a binomial distribution of the individual subunits between two closed states and a voltage-dependent slow transition between these conformations. The wild-type subunits, participating in a heterotetrameric channel, are decisive for the slow gating kinetics. The bovine eag1 gene (7Frings S. Brull N. Dzeja C. Angele A. Hagen V. Kaupp U.B. Baumann A. J. Gen. Physiol. 1998; 111: 583-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) was used to generate the mutants and chimeric constructs. Constructs were subcloned into the oocyte expression vector pGEMHE (14Liman E.R. Tytgat J. Hess P. Neuron. 1992; 9: 861-871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (983) Google Scholar) using the restriction sitesBamHI and HindIII. The point mutation L322H was created by site-directed mutagenesis using the polymerase chain reaction. The polymerase chain reaction product was transferred into the wild-type plasmid as a BstBI-MluI fragment, and the sequence of the complete fragment was verified by cycle sequencing of the plasmid DNA. For construction of dimeric and tetrameric eag genes, we introduced EcoRV andHindIII restriction sites at the 3′ end of theeag gene. The modified 3′ end reads GGCGCAAGCggatatcaatgataagctt (lowercase letters are for added nucleotides). This construct was opened with EcoRV andHindIII, and a second gene copy was coupled to the 3′ end as an SmaI-HindIII fragment. The SmaI site is part of the upstream region of b-eag in pGEMHE (cccggggatccaccATG, start codon is in capitals). The junction of the two gene copies encodes five additional amino acids (GWGST). Two dimer constructs were then linked using the same restriction sites to obtain a tetrameric gene. The T7 mMessage mMachine Kit (Ambion, Austin, TX) was used for mRNA synthesis after linearization withNheI. Stage V oocytes were prepared from Xenopus laevis as described previously (15Stühmer W. Terlau H. Heinemann S.H. Kettenmann H. Grantyn R. Practical Electrophysiological Methods. Wiley-Liss, New York1992: 121-125Google Scholar), and 50 nl of in vitro transcribed mRNA (5–500 ng/μl) were injected. Currents were recorded at 20–23 °C in the period ranging from 1 to 7 days after injection. A two-electrode voltage clamp amplifier (Turbo-TEC 10CD, NPI electronic, Tamm, Germany) was used, and electrodes filled with 2 m KCl had resistances between 0.5 and 0.9 megaohms. The bath solution was normal frog Ringer's (NFR), containing 115 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm KCl, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.2 (NaOH). MgCl2 or NiCl2 was added to this solution at concentrations indicated for individual experiments. Thus, the external solution always contained 1.8 mmCa2+ ions, as complete removal of divalent ions resulted in the emergence of a leak current without strong reduction of the Cole-Moore shift of b-EAG1 (not shown). Experiment control including pulse generation and data recording was performed with the Pulse + PulseFit software package (HEKA elektronik, Lambrecht, Germany). A P/n method, supported by Pulse + PulseFit, was used in all experiments for correction of leak and capacitive currents. Data were analyzed using PulseFit, PulseTools (HEKA elektronik) and IgorPro (WaveMetrics, Lake Oswego, Oregon) running on Macintosh and PC-compatible computers. Analyzed parameters are presented as mean ±S.E., withn = number of independent experiments. Normalized conductances as shown in Fig. 1 C were obtained by fitting the following equation to the current-voltage data: I(V)=ΓV1−e−(V−Erev)/25mV1−e−V/25mV11+e−(V−Vh)/kEquation 1 where Γ is the maximal conductance, andE rev is the estimated reversal potential. The first term accounts for the single-channel conductance according to the Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz equation. The last term describes the open probability (p open) of the channels, characterized by the voltage of half-maximal activation,V h, and a slope factor, k. Time course of activation of wild-type b-EAG channels was described using the following equation: I(t)=a{(1−p)n(1−e−t·kf)+[∑​i=1n(in)pi(1−p)n−i(1−e−t·ks)i]}Equation 2 In this equation, the symbols have the following meaning:a = amplitude, k f = rate constant of channel activation when all slow gates are activated,k s = rate constant of activation per slow subunit,n = number of slow subunits, p = probability for a subunit being in a state from which activation is slow. In the figures, the speed of activation is shown as time constant, i.e. the inverse of the rate constants (e.g. τ s =1/k s). To account for the limited clamp speed of the two-electrode voltage clamp, a time delay of 1 ms was assumed. This model implies a binomial distribution of subunits between “fast” and “slow” states. Activation of channel constructs with only two or one wild-type subunit were described by this equation, assumingn = 2 or 1, respectively. In this case pdenotes the probability of being in a “slow” state for wild-type subunits only. As shown in the results section, this equation gives a very reliable description of the data obtained in elevated concentrations of divalent cations (e.g. Mg2+) and using a negative holding potential. In such cases (p > 0.5), the first term, describing fast activation, basically vanishes ((1 − 0.5)4 = 0.0625). Thus, the activation is described by only three free parameters: a,p, and k s. In cases where p is small, the fast component adds another free parameter,k f. We chose to describe fast activation with a single-exponential component rather than with the fourth power, because the limited speed of the two-electrode voltage clamp and the rapid activation rate, k f, hampered a faithful resolution. The results obtained for the slow Mg2+-dependent gating of b-EAG channels, however, were not affected by this limitation. Individual data traces were fitted according to Equation 2 using a Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm as implemented in IgorPro. Whole sets of data traces similar to those shown in Fig. 5 were simultaneously fitted according to Equation 2 using a Simplex algorithm, programmed after Caceci and Cacheris (16Caceci M.S. Cacheris W.P. Byte. 1984; 9: 340-362Google Scholar). In this case, identical k fand k s values were used for all traces, whereas individual p values were assigned to each trace asp is a function of prepulse potential (see Fig. 5). We were interested in identifying amino acid residues that influence the characteristic gating of EAG channels. As shown previously, deletions in the cytoplasmic amino terminus of rat EAG affect both voltage dependence and activation kinetics of the channels (17Terlau H. Heinemann S.H. Stühmer W. Pongs O. Ludwig J. J. Physiol. 1997; 502: 537-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). A point mutation at the cytoplasmic face of the S4 segment (H343R) was found to largely compensate for the effect of such deletions (17Terlau H. Heinemann S.H. Stühmer W. Pongs O. Ludwig J. J. Physiol. 1997; 502: 537-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), and the same phenotype was found for the analogous mutations introduced into the bovine EAG channel (not shown). Recently, Tang and Papazian (18Tang C.Y. Papazian D.M. J. Gen. Physiol. 1997; 109: 301-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) described mutations close to the extracellular part of the S4 segment of the Drosophila EAG channel. A point mutation that replaced a leucine residue in position 342 by histidine led to a shift of the current-voltage relation by 16 mV to depolarized voltages. We introduced the equivalent mutation at the corresponding position of b-EAG1 (L322H) (Fig.1 A). Under a two-electrode voltage clamp, this mutant gave rise to delayed rectifier currents, very similar to wild-type currents when expressed in Xenopusoocytes (Fig. 1 B). A comparison ofp open over the tested voltage range shows that channels carrying the mutation L322H open at more negative voltages than wild-type channels (Fig. 1 C). The voltage required for half-maximal activation (V h) of the mutant channels was shifted by more than 30 mV to hyperpolarized voltages (wild type, −11.8 ± 2.2 mV, n = 8; L322H, −45.1 ± 1.8 mV, n = 12), whereas the slope factors (k) were not significantly different (Fig. 1 D). To characterize the activation kinetics of b-EAG1 and the effect of the L322H mutation in more detail, we applied repeated test pulses to +40 mV and varied the prepulse potential between −130 and −70 mV with increments of 10 mV. The resulting current traces, recorded under a two-electrode voltage clamp are shown in Fig.2 A. As extracellular bath solution, we used NFR, containing different concentrations of either Mg2+ or Ni2+ ions. b-EAG1 channels responded to changes in the holding potential in a very similar fashion as described previously for r-EAG channels (13Terlau H. Ludwig J. Steffan R. Pongs O. Stühmer W. Heinemann S.H. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1996; 432: 301-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Hyperpolarizing prepulses caused a marked slowing of current activation, even in 0 mm[Mg2+]o. Increasing the concentration of extracellular Mg2+ to 10 mm resulted in additional slowing of the activation kinetics. Further slowing of the activation was observed in solutions containing 1 mmNi2+. For a model-independent description of the time course of activation, we plotted the time to reach 80% of the maximum current amplitude as a function of the prepulse potential (Fig.2 B). In 0 mm [Mg2+]o, the slowing effect of the prepulses on b-EAG1 saturates at about −130 mV (open circles), whereas in 2 mm[Mg2+]o saturation already occurs at potentials more negative than −90 mV (open triangles). In 10 mm [Mg2+]o, the channels always activated slowly, almost independent of the prepulse voltages (open squares). For comparison, the mutant channels, analyzed under the same ionic conditions, showed that the point mutation L322H accelerated the activation kinetics by about 1 order of magnitude (closed circles). In addition, the prepulse dependence in Mg2+-free NFR solution was almost completely abolished. The mutant channels still responded to variations in the extracellular cation concentration. In 10 mm[Mg2+]o, the time to reach 80% activation at different holding potentials is very similar to the values found for the wild type in the absence of Mg2+ (compare open circles and filled squares in Fig. 2 B). For a quantitative comparison of the gating kinetics of mutant and wild-type channels, we built on a gating model introduced by Terlau et al. (13Terlau H. Ludwig J. Steffan R. Pongs O. Stühmer W. Heinemann S.H. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1996; 432: 301-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). According to that model, EAG channels undergo two qualitatively different classes of conformational transitions upon depolarization. Rapid activation steps follow a slow conformational change, which is dependent on extracellular divalent cations. The latter steps are similar to what has been described for other voltage-gated potassium channels. Therefore, we assumed at the holding potential, a binomial distribution of all four individual subunits between the slow gates being turned on or off. The probability of being in a “slow” state (p) will be a function of both the holding potential and the concentration of extracellular divalent cations. Starting from such a steady-state distribution among slow and fast states, the activation time course was calculated by assuming single-exponential relaxation of all “slow” subunits with a slow rate constant, k s. Fast subunits contribute to the lumped rapid activation according to k f(Equation 2). Fits according to this simple model (Equation 2 withn = 4) matched perfectly to experimental data from b-EAG1, obtained at various concentrations of extracellular Mg2+ (Fig. 3 A,left, fits in black), regardless of whether prepulses to −130 mV or to −70 mV were applied. The current traces shown represent the mean currents of six independent experiments. Individual traces from different experiments were first normalized to the maximum current level at the end of the test pulse. These traces were then used to calculate mean current traces. The employed model is obviously well suited to describe both the hyperpolarization-induced shift and its regulation by Mg2+. The composition of the mean current from contributions of fast and slow gating channels is well demonstrated in 10 mm Mg2+ using a prepulse voltage of −70 mV (Fig. 3 A, lower left panel,lowest trace). A rapidly activating current component is followed by a slowly activating component. The relative amplitude of the fast component with about 15% of the total current is in good accordance with a probability of about 38% for individual subunits to go through the slow gating transition. The two free fit parameters, namely the probability of starting from a slow state, p, and the time constant for a slow transition, 1/k s, are plotted as a function of [Mg2+] in Fig. 3, Band C, respectively (open symbols). Althoughp is a function of both, the prepulse potential and [Mg2+], 1/k s is only a function of [Mg2+], thus providing a test for the validity of this simple approach. Data for the mutant L322H (Fig. 3 A, right) were analyzed with the same method, using n = 4 in Equation2. Because of the more rapid activation, fits were only performed to the first 300 ms after depolarization. Although the initial part of the traces was described well, a minor third current component with very slow kinetics could not be accounted for. The fit parameters for the mutant are shown as closed symbols in Fig. 3, Band C. p was generally much smaller than for the wild type, and the time constants for the activation of the slow gates did not depend on [Mg2+]. In addition, this time constant was similar to the time constant of wild-type subunits in the absence of Mg2+ (≈50 ms). Thus, these results indicate that data of the wild-type channel were adequately described by Equation 2. Moreover, the mutant subunits do not seem to contribute significantly to the slow gating, and they can be safely discriminated from wild-type subunits in high [Mg2+]. Potassium channels are formed as symmetric tetramers of α-subunits assembled around a central pore (19Doyle D.A. Cabral J.M. Pfuetzner R.A. Kuo A. Gulbis J.M. Cohen S.L. Chait B.T. MacKinnon R. Science. 1998; 280: 69-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (5768) Google Scholar, 20Isacoff E.Y. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Nature. 1990; 345: 530-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar, 21MacKinnon R. Nature. 1991; 350: 232-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (768) Google Scholar). Thus, the S3-S4 linker region, which is apparently involved in the process leading to slow activation, is represented in four copies in the functional channel. This raises the question, whether the slow activation of wild-type channels after hyperpolarization is a concerted action of all four subunits (mediated by the binding of up to four Mg2+ ions) or if it is a function of single and independent gating events. To assess this problem, we chose the approach of concatenated genes to control the stoichiometry of fast (L322H) and slow (wild type) gating subunits in the tetramer. A dimeric construct containing one mutant and one wild-type subunit was made by linking the cytoplasmic carboxyl terminus of a mutant to the amino terminus of a wild-type subunit (m-w, see “Experimental Procedures”). Expression of this construct should result in channels with a 2 + 2 stoichiometry. The same stoichiometry was expected for another dimer (w-m) and two tetrameric constructs (m-w-w-m, w-m-w-m), which resulted from the coupling of two dimers. All constructs were functionally expressed in oocytes. To obtain similar current amplitudes, mRNA concentrations 5 times and 20 times higher than for the wild type had to be injected for dimers and tetramers, respectively. A channel formed by wild-type dimers (w-w) did not show significantly different activation than channels formed by wild-type monomers (not shown). As shown in Fig.4 A, all four constructs with a 2 + 2 stoichiometry resulted in intermediate activation kinetics when compared with wild-type (w-w) or mutant (m) channels. An additional tetramer construct containing only one wild-type subunit (m-m-m-w) activated faster than channels with a 2 + 2 stoichiometry but slower than the mutant monomers. In theupper panel of Fig. 4 A, currents were elicited from hyperpolarized holding potentials in the presence of 5 mm Mg2+, favoring the slow channel activation. In the lower panel,we applied test pulses from a holding potential of −70 mV. All traces shown are mean traces from at least 5 individual experiments. Note that the four tested constructs with theoretical 2 + 2 stoichiometry show similar but not identical activation kinetics. This probably reflects a possible deviation of the actual channel assembly from the expected structures, as depicted in Fig. 4 B (see “Discussion”). Apart from these minor deviations, the linked constructs clearly show that the activation kinetics of b-EAG channels is determined by the gating properties of the individual subunits constituting the channel rather than by a concerted action that requires all four subunits for slow activation. In contrast to this additive regulation of the gating kinetics, the changes in the current-voltage dependence of steady-state currents were much more dominated by wild-type subunits. TheV h values of the tetramers with 2+2 stoichiometry (m-w-w-m: −11.1 ± 0.7 mV,n = 11; w-m-w-m: −6.1 ± 2.3 mV,n = 7) did not significantly differ from the wild type (-11.8 ± 2.2 mV, n = 8). Only them-m-m-w tetramer was shifted to hyperpolarized potential (-22.9 ± 0.6 mV, n = 12), though much less pronounced than the completely mutated channel (-45.1 ± 1.8 mV,n = 12). Obviously the wild-type subunit, which needs more positive potentials to gate open, dominates the behavior of the channel. The data shown in Fig. 4 already indicate that an increasing number of wild-type subunits per channel progressively slow down channel activation. As the mutated subunits give rise to considerable faster activation and smallp values (see Fig. 3), it might be possible to describe the data for the linked constructs with a 2 + 2 or 1 + 3 stoichiometry by using Equation 2 with n = 2 or 1, respectively. In this case, the mutant subunits are only considered to contribute to the lumped fast activation component. In addition, it should be assumed that both rate constants for activation, k f andk s, are only a function of the test potential and not of the prepulse potential. Mean normalized currents in 5 mm Mg2+, elicited by test pulses to +20 mV, are shown in Fig. 5 for the indicated constructs and prepulse voltages. All recorded currents of the wild-type construct (w-w) were simultaneously fitted with Equation 2 with n = 4, yielding 1/k f= 10 ms and 1/k s = 215 ms. Note that in contrast to the fits shown in Fig. 3, we now used more constrained fit conditions, as nine different activation time courses (corresponding to 9 prepulse potentials) had to be described simultaneously. Fitted curves are superimposed (black), indicating that even this heavily constrained fit describes the data (gray) well. The resulting p values are plotted in Fig.6 as a function of prepulse potential (open circles). The data of constructs m-w andm-m-m-w were then fitted to Equation 2 assumingn = 2 or 1, respectively. The data fits resulted in 1/k f = 9.9 ms and 1/k s = 152 ms for m-w and 1/k f = 11.9 ms and1/k s = 171 ms for m-m-m-w. It is clearly shown that the data are described well. Similar fits withn = 4 gave consistently worse results (not shown). Thep values are also shown in Fig. 6, indicating that, similarly to the k s and k fvalues, they are rather similar for wild-type subunits in a homotetrameric channel (w-w). Mutant subunits, however, yield much smaller p values, as already shown in Fig. 3 and smaller time constants: 1/k f = 7.2 ms and 1/k s = 79 ms (mutants (m) were fitted with Equation 2 using n = 4). The shown fits and the high similarity of 1/k s, 1/k f, and p-slow values for the wild-type subunits in all analyzed constructs strongly support our assumption that slow gating of EAG channels can be quantitatively described by the independent gating of the participating wild-type subunits. EAG potassium channels activate in a rather unique way as the kinetics of channel opening strongly depend on the voltage that the channel proteins experience before depolarization. Hyperpolarizing prepulses result in a slowed activation and cause a more sigmoidal rising phase of the current waveform (9Meyer R. Heinemann S.H. J. Physiol. 1998; 508: 49-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 11Ludwig J. Terlau H. Wunder F. Brüggemann A. Pardo L.A. Marquardt A. Stühmer W. Pongs O.

Similar to hyperpolarizing prepulses, extracellular divalent cations,e.g. Mg2+, slow the activation kinetics and increase the sigmoidicity of the rising phase. Because of this similarity, a common mechanism has been proposed for Cole-Moore shift and Mg2+ regulation. Mg2+ ions could shift the equilibrium voltage between two closed states, leading to either slow or fast activation (13Terlau H. Ludwig J. Steffan R. Pongs O. Stühmer W. Heinemann S.H. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1996; 432: 301-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Detailed analysis of the prepulse dependence and the effect of extracellular Mg2+ gave rise to a model in which up to four slow gating steps precede fast channel activation (13Terlau H. Ludwig J. Steffan R. Pongs O. Stühmer W. Heinemann S.H. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1996; 432: 301-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). In Drosophila EAG, (d-EAG) channels, Tang and Papazian (18Tang C.Y. Papazian D.M. J. Gen. Physiol. 1997; 109: 301-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) found that deletions and point mutations in the extracellular S3-S4 linker had severe effects on the gating characteristics. A deletion of five charged residues slowed the activation in the presence of Mg2+ ions. A direct hint, pointing to the S3-S4 linker as regulator of the Cole-Moore shift, was the observation that a naturally occurring splice variant (b-EAG2) of the recently cloned bovine EAG channel is characterized by a 27-amino acid insertion in this linker, making this protein more sensitive to [Mg2+]o compared with b-EAG1 (7Frings S. Brull N. Dzeja C. Angele A. Hagen V. Kaupp U.B. Baumann A. J. Gen. Physiol. 1998; 111: 583-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Mutagenesis in b-eag1 now provided further evidence for the importance of the S3-S4 linker. The single amino acid exchange in the b-EAG1 channel (L322H) significantly reduced the prepulse dependence of the channels (Fig. 2). Interestingly, in addition to the faster activation, the voltage dependence of the steady-state current was shifted toward hyperpolarizing voltages for this mutant (Fig. 1). This is in striking contrast to a depolarizing shift observed by Tang and Papazian (18Tang C.Y. Papazian D.M. J. Gen. Physiol. 1997; 109: 301-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) for the d-EAG L342H mutant. The opposite effects of analogous mutations may be because of further differences in the S3-S4 linker regions of both channels (Fig. 1 A). The mutation L322H caused a strong reduction of the EAG-specific slow activation process. In particular, the prepulse dependence and the influence of extracellular divalent cations was strongly reduced. It could be speculated that L322H alters a regulatory Mg2+binding site on the channel and thereby leads to faster channel activation. However, this interpretation would not explain the accelerated activation kinetics of L322H channels even in the absence of Mg2+. Furthermore, a leucine is very unlikely to participate directly in binding divalent cations. Thus, it appears that the mutation primarily reduces the marked prepulse dependence of the channels but does not abolish the binding of Mg2+ ions. For a quantitative description of the gating characteristics of wild-type and mutant channels, we assumed a binomial distribution of four subunits among slow and fast states. This simple independent model yielded convincing fits to the experimental data, suggesting that the main effect of the L322H mutation is a strong reduction of the probability for a subunit to be in the slowly activating state (p-slow), both in the absence and presence of Mg2+ ions. One could speculate that Mg2+binding is reduced in the fast state, but there is no direct evidence yet. Interestingly, the time constant of L322H subunit activation does not depend on the Mg2+ concentration anymore, whereas for the wild-type channels, it is increased by a factor of 2 in 10 mm [Mg2+] (Fig. 3 C). Presently, it is not clear whether or not this results from limitations of the simple model employed. It also remains to be investigated to what extent changes in surface potential with increasing [Mg2+] can account for such an effect. In this respect it is noteworthy that an analysis of b-EAG1 activation with double exponentials, thus not taking into account an independent activation of up to four subunits, resulted in k s values independent of [Mg2+] (7Frings S. Brull N. Dzeja C. Angele A. Hagen V. Kaupp U.B. Baumann A. J. Gen. Physiol. 1998; 111: 583-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Our previous results with rat EAG (13Terlau H. Ludwig J. Steffan R. Pongs O. Stühmer W. Heinemann S.H. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1996; 432: 301-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) and the results with b-EAG1, strongly suggest that the independent model gives rise to better fits without introducing more free parameters. As our independent model for the slow gating of b-EAG channels was well suited to fit the ionic currents, the Cole-Moore shift of the channels should be because of a voltage-dependent gating step that is independent for all four subunits. To assess this question experimentally, we engineered channel constructs of concatenated wild-type and mutant eag1 genes, leading to dimers and tetramers with various combinations of the different subunits. The aim was to control the number of subunits in the channel that undergo the slow gating transition. Mutant L322H was well suited for that purpose as its rapid gating property can be safely distinguished from wild type. Although all combinations gave rise to functional channels, the expression level decreased with the increasing number of linked subunits. Although concatenated genes became a common tool to assess subunit stoichiometry (14Liman E.R. Tytgat J. Hess P.

Biophys. J. 1992; 63: 1406-1411Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) described a preferential insertion of the NH2-terminal subunit into the tetramers. Thus, it may happen that functional tetramers are formed from three or even four dimers if only one-half of a dimer contributes to the channel. Therefore, quantitative analysis of linked constructs should include controls with opposite order of the linked subunits. We constructed m-w and w-mdimers and found that activation of w-m dimers was slightly slower than that of m-w dimers (Fig. 4 A), suggesting a smaller probability of functional incorporation of the carboxyl-terminal subunit. The two tetrameric constructs with 2 + 2 stoichiometry showed almost no deviations in the activation kinetics, regardless of the order of the subunits (m-w-m-w orm-w-w-m), indicating the assembly of the complete entity. However, all tetramers lead to lower current amplitudes, probably because of impaired translation/translocation processes for these large proteins. In summary, we found that linked b-EAG1 channels do form functional complexes that possess almost the expected configuration as illustrated in Fig. 4 B. After validating the approach of concatemer expression of b-EAG1 with L322H mutations, we set out to perform a quantitative description of channel activation, based on the predicted subunit stoichiometry. As shown in Fig. 5, simultaneous data fits to whole Cole-Moore data sets resulted in reasonable fits of the wild type and constructs with a 2 + 2 and 1 + 3 subunit stoichiometry. We chose the tetramer m-m-m-w; given the slightly smaller probability of functional incorporation of the last subunit, any slow activation will be a result of functional constructs of exactly that stoichiometry. Thus, these results show that the slow, Mg2+-dependent activation of b-EAG channels is mediated by the slow activation of each of the four subunits. At present, we cannot completely exclude that there is a certain degree of cooperativity among the slow gating steps. We tried to address this question by comparing the constructs m-w-m-w andm-w-w-m. As illustrated in Fig. 4 B, upon correct assembly, these constructs both will have a 2 + 2 stoichiometry. In the latter case, channels contain two wild-type and mutant subunits as direct neighbors, whereas in the former case, the subunits are distributed diametrically. Comparison of the activation kinetics in 5 mm Mg2+ from −130 and −70 mV did not reveal differences between these isoforms. This suggests that the subunit position within the channel construct is not important for channel gating. The number of wild-type subunits per channel, however, may still give rise to cooperative gating. In the framework of the employed gating model (Equation 2), the dependence of p for wild-type subunits on the prepulse voltage should not depend on the construct type. As shown in Fig. 6, this is qualitatively the case when compared with mutant subunits. However, it seems that the steepness of the prepulse dependence depends on the number of wild-type subunits per channel. Boltzmann fits to the data plotted in Fig. 6 reveal slope factors of 12.6 mV for the wild type (w-w), 18.5 mV for the dimeric construct m-w, i.e. a 2 + 2 stoichiometry, and 28.2 mV for the tetrameric constructm-m-m-w, i.e. a 1 + 3 stoichiometry. This behavior may indeed be indicative of some subunit cooperativity, which remains to be investigated in more detail. What can we learn from b-EAG1 L322H about the mechanism underlying the Cole-Moore shift of EAG channels? The introduced mutation is located close to the external part of the S4 segment. As it strongly reduced the prepulse dependence rather than the Mg2+ regulation, it is suggested that the S4 segment is involved in the conformational change underlying the slow gating of EAG channels. Thus, it is very likely that this conformational change also derives its voltage dependence from the S4 voltage sensor, although operating at a much more negative voltage than the fast gating, which leads to channel opening. This interpretation is consistent with our previous results, which showed that the effect of the NH2 terminus on the Cole-Moore shift is based on a close contact between this cytoplasmic domain and the cytoplasmic part of the S4 segment (17Terlau H.

We report here that Cu(II) addition accelerates the rate of metHb β chain reduction by CO by a factor of about 1000. A mechanism whereby electron transfer occurs via an internal pathway coupling CO/H2O oxidation to Fe(III) and Cu(II) reduction is suggested by the observation that the copper-induced rate enhancement is inhibited by blocking Cys-β93 withN-ethylmaleimide. Furthermore, this internal electron-transfer pathway is more readily established at low Cu(II) concentrations in Hb Deer Lodge (β2His → Arg) and other species lacking His-β2 than in Hb A0. This difference is consistent with preferential binding of Cu(II) in Hb A0 to a high affinity site involving His-β2, which is ineffective in promoting electron exchange between Cu(II) and the β heme iron. Effective electron transfer is thus affected by Hb type but is not governed by the R ↔ T conformational equilibrium. The β hemes in Cu(II)-metHb are reduced under CO at rates close to those observed for cytochrome c oxidase, where heme and copper are present together in the oxygen-binding site and where internal electron transfer also occurs.

It has been suggested that low levels of copper, normally present in vivo, promote Hb oxidation and that copper-induced oxidation contributes to loss of reducing potential in the red cell and eventual red cell deterioration. Copper is toxic at elevated levels, and the mechanism of toxicity involves increased rates of Hb oxidation with adverse side reactions such as increased cell membrane oxidation (1Rifkind J.M.

We owe much of our understanding of copper-induced oxidation of Hb to the work of Winterbourn and Rifkind and co-workers (1Rifkind J.M. Sigel H. Metal Ions in Biological Systems.

J. 1977; 165: 141-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), who showed that copper-induced oxidation of oxyHb occurs through an internal electron transfer pathway between the iron atoms of the β chain hemes and copper bound at or near the β93 sulfhydryls. They found that Cu(II) binding to Hb facilitates the oxidation process through this internal pathway only when the amount of Cu(II) exceeds that bound at unreactive high affinity sites, which in Hb A0 includes the β2 histidine residues. As a consequence, the oxidative reaction proceeds less readily at low copper concentrations in Hb A0than in the human Hb variant Hb Deer Lodge (β2His → Arg) and in Hbs of species that lack His-β2 (1Rifkind J.M. Sigel H. Metal Ions in Biological Systems. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1981: 191-232Google Scholar). Hb Deer Lodge has higher oxygen affinity and increased anion sensitivity and is more readily oxidized than Hb A0 (7Bonaventura J. Bonaventura C. Sullivan B. Godette G. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 496-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). We have used Hb Deer Lodge and Hb A0 in the present studies in which we show that CO/H2O-driven electron transfer can bring about a reduction of the β chain hemes that utilizes this internal electron transfer pathway. Previous studies carried out in our laboratories have shown that Fe3+ in isolated heme (hemin), in Hb, in cytochromec oxidase and in several other oxygen-binding proteins can become reduced when maintained under an atmosphere of CO, with the half-cell reaction given in Eq. 1 driving the overall process (9Bickar D.

CO+H2O→CO2+2H++2e−Equation 1 In the following we refer to metal reduction coupled to this half-reaction as CO/H2O-driven reduction. The overall free-energy change is clearly dependent upon the identity and environment of the metals reduced. The process of reduction under CO was called “autoreduction” by previous workers (10Wharton D.C. Gibson Q.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 243: 702-706Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Greenwood C. Wilson M.T. Brunori M. Biochem. J. 1974; 137: 205-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 12Nicholls P.

Proc. 1980; 39: 2090Google Scholar) who noted that cytochrome c oxidase, with two constituent electron-accepting metal centers in the oxygen-binding site, becomes reduced under CO. Heme a 3 in the oxygen-binding site of the oxidase is typically reduced in less than an hour, with a much slower (overnight) incubation required to bring about reduction of heme a. The details of the reduction of cytochromec oxidase are not well understood, and there are clearly competing processes that have hindered elucidation of the mechanism (15Young L.J. Caughey W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 15019-15025Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We now report that Cu(II) addition to metHb dramatically increases the rate of heme reduction under CO. We show that Cu(II) is reduced to Cu(I) as the reaction proceeds and that the enhanced rate of reduction is inhibited by sulfhydryl reagents such asN-ethylmaleimide. The data indicate the existence of an internal pathway that is used for electron exchange between the heme iron and the bound Cu(II). Samples of native adult human hemoglobin (Hb A0) and Hb Deer Lodge were prepared by the ammonium sulfate method, chromatographically purified, and stripped of organic phosphate cofactors as described previously (7Bonaventura J. Bonaventura C. Sullivan B. Godette G. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 9250-9255Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Horse Hb was prepared similarly but without chromatographic purification. The samples were typically dialyzed against 0.05 m Tris at pH 8.3 with selected anions as desired. Concentrations and compositions of samples were determined spectrophotometrically, using Hewlett-Packard 8451 and 8453 Diode Array spectrophotometers for routine measurements and a Perkin-Elmer λ6 dual beam-scanning spectrophotometer for higher resolution work. Samples were usually measured in 1-cm path length cuvettes, but cells with 2-mm path lengths were used to obtain spectral data on samples whose optical density would have gone beyond the linear response range of these instruments. Oxidized (met)Hb samples were made by treatment with potassium ferricyanide at 1.2-fold excess over heme. Sequential Sephadex G-25 chromatographies (high salt then no salt) were used to remove free and bound ferricyanide and ferrocyanide from the metHb samples. The amounts of oxidized Hb (metHb), deoxyHb, oxygenated Hb (oxyHb), carbon monoxyHb (CO-Hb), and hemichrome were determined by spectral analysis. Samples that contained any detectable hemichrome were discarded. The stock Hb solutions, typically 1–2 mmin heme units (iron-porphyrin units), were stored in liquid nitrogen prior to use. Sodium dithionite at 2 mg/ml was used as a reductant to obtain spectra of the fully reduced proteins. Hb with only the β chain hemes oxidized was prepared by addition of a 5-fold excess of CuSO4 over oxyHb. It has been shown (2Winterbourn C.C. INSERM. 1977; 70: 97-106Google Scholar, 16Nagel R.L.

Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 5337-5343Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) that under these conditions the β chain hemes are selectively oxidized, whereas the α chain hemes remain in the reduced, ferrous state. Isolation of α and β chains of Hb A0 was accomplished by use of a modified version of established methods in whichpara-hydroxymercuribenzoate binds to SH groups and encourages dissociation of the Hb tetramer (18Geraci G. Parkhurst L.J. Gibson Q.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 4664-4667Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Our modifications consisted of carrying out the separations at 4 °C, using chromatographies with CMC cellulose (for β chains) and DEAE cellulose (for α chains) that effectively separate the chains. Regeneration of the SH groups of the β chains was done by treatment with β-mercaptoethanol to reduce SH groups, followed by chromatography through DEAE-cellulose to removepara-hydroxymercuribenzoate. Tetramers of β chains form spontaneously after SH groups are regenerated. The free SH groups of Hb (at position β93) were blocked by treating Hb A0 with N-ethylmaleimide (NEM) at a protein-to-reagent ratio of 1:3. The reaction was carried out at 37 °C for 1 h with the reactants in 0.05 mbis-Tris, pH 7.2, followed by Sephadex G-25 chromatography to separate the Hb from the low molecular weight reagent. Carboxypeptidase A-digested Hb A0 (HbCPA) was prepared by treating the CO derivative of Hb A0 with carboxypeptidase A (Sigma, type 1, diisopropyl fluorophosphate) at an enzyme-to-protein ratio of 1:50. The mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 2 h and then dialyzed at 4 °C against 0.05 m Tris buffer, pH 8.3. This enzymatic digestion under the conditions employed removes the C-terminal His and Tyr of the β chains as verified by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry. Cu(II)-metHb complexes were made by adding CuSO4 to metHb at indicated ratios of copper to heme. Hb samples in some cases were treated with 5-fold excess of Cu(II) and then stripped of unbound or loosely bound copper by passage through a Chelex resin column. In other experiments, the copper-Hb complexes were made by addition of copper at the desired ratio of copper to heme without subsequent Chelex treatment. Elemental analysis of samples by atomic absorption spectroscopy (Perkin-Elmer 5000) following copper treatment validated the copper:iron ratios used and demonstrated that our Chelex chromatography of samples treated with a 5-fold excess of copper typically reduced the copper:heme ratio to about 0.6:1, consistent with retention of copper at unreactive high affinity sites and partial retention of copper at the lower affinity sites associated with electron transfer to the heme. Prolonged exposure to Chelex eventually removes all Cu. Incubations under CO were done with chemically pure grade (≤99.5% purity) CO gas provided by National Welders, Inc. For visible-region spectroscopy of copper-Hb complexes, CO gas was added to tonometers containing thoroughly deoxygenated metHb samples. Deoxygenation was accomplished by multiple stages of sequential evacuation and purging with argon or nitrogen to ensure that no oxygen was present in the samples before CO incubation was begun. For EPR measurements, incubations of samples under CO were done for time intervals indicated under “Results” and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen in EPR tubes for assays. Aqueous CuSO4 in the absence of Hb or other proteins was incubated in MES buffer with IHP at pH 6, 20 °C. Sodium dithionite (2 mg/ml) was added after variable periods of incubation under CO to generate the spectra of the fully reduced proteins. EPR spectra of Hbs at about 0.5 mm in heme were recorded on a hybrid machine consisting of a Varian E109E spectrometer console used to provide the field modulation to a Bruker B-E 25 magnet, with an ER 082 power supply and a B-H 15 field controller, plus a Varian E102 microwave bridge coupled to a V-453.3 cylindrical cavity. Temperature control was effected by means of an Oxford Instruments ESR 900 liquid helium flow cryostat and accessories. The g values of samples were measured with reference to diphenylpicrylhydrazyl. Spin concentrations were determined by double integration using Cu(II)-EDTA, equine ferricytochrome c, and a quantitatively high spin methemoglobin sample as integration standards for the g= 2, 3, and 6 regions of spectra, respectively. Heme reduction brought about by incubation under CO allows for binding of CO, so that time courses show a disappearance of the spectral features of metHb and an appearance of the features of CO-Hb. There are generally good isosbestic points for the transition, with the exception of experimental conditions described later. Cu(II) addition significantly enhances the rate of metHb reduction, with enhanced rates evident only for the β chains of the Hb tetramer. Specificity for β chains in Cu(II)-enhanced rates of reduction is supported by the fact that there are similar reaction kinetics for half-reduction of a Cu(II)-metHb complex, α(III)2β(III)2, and for full reduction of a half-metHb preparation, α(II)2β(III)2, with the same ratio of Cu(II) to heme. Fig. 1shows the spectral changes in these two samples brought about by incubation under CO. Good isosbestic points between the met and CO derivatives are observed in both cases. The fully oxidized Hb becomes half-reduced in about 10 h, with a half-time of β chain reduction of about 4.5 h. For the copper-Hb complex with only the β chains oxidized, the half-time for reduction is also about 4.5 h. We conclude that it is the reduction of the β chain hemes that is appreciably increased in rate by copper addition and that the oxidation state of the partner chains is not a major determinant of the reduction rate. Isolated β chains were prepared as described under “Experimental Procedures.” After regeneration of SH groups, the β chains spontaneously form tetramers. The β4 tetramers donot show an increase in the rate of CO/H2O-driven reduction when observed at a copper:heme ratio of 0.5 (Table I). However, Cu(II)-enhanced rates of reduction are observed when the copper:heme ratio is raised to 2. Rates of reduction under CO at this Cu(II) level are appreciably enhanced over controls. Rate estimates at this Cu(II) level are not given in Table I because of uncertainties associated with some sample precipitation during these experiments. The requirement for higher Cu(II) levels in β4 tetramers can be explained by the fact that each β chain has a high affinity copper-binding site at the β2 position that would be expected to be ineffective in electron transfer. The failure to see copper-enhanced rates at ratios below 1 copper per heme is thus an indication that Cu(II) has limited access to effective electron transfer sites in the β4 tetramers. We conducted an additional experiment to determine if the requirement of high copper:heme levels for reduction of β4 tetramers was due to some artifactual modification of the β chains during the isolation procedure. We found that the β chains do become reduced under CO at a copper:heme ration of 0.5 when present in half-met α(II)2β(III)2tetramers that were made by 1:1 mixing of the isolated β chains with reduced α chains. This experiment with reconstituted half-met tetramers gave results similar to those shown in Fig. 1 B. This confirmed that the isolated β chains were selectively reduced under CO after copper addition.Table IEffect of Cu(II) on apparent rate constants for CO/H2O-driven reduction of heme in various proteins under varied conditionsHeme protein Fe(III) sourceExperimental conditionsRatio of copper:hemeApparent rate constants (h−1)k 1% fastk 2HbA0Control00.003α3+β3+0.45aChelex treated after 5:1 copper.0.26380.009α2+β3+0.5aChelex treated after 5:1 copper.,bData from Fig. 1.0.28490.007HbA00.25<50.0010.2aChelex treated after 5:1 copper.0.28310.0160.50.50400.0190.70.46390.009pH 70.60.40420.004pH 7, 20 °C0.70.47410.006+IHP, 24 °C0.50.13320.006+IHP, 32 °C0.50.14250.007+IHP, pH 70.50.28440.002+IHP, pH 7.50.50.15460.002β of HbA0cSee text.Control, 20 °C00.00520 °C0.500.004NEM of HbA0Control00.0090.5<50.00920 °C0.70.009+IHP, 32 °C<50.016CPA of HbA0Control00.0060.50.13170.006+IHP0.50.49440.007Hb Deer LodgeControl00.0010.250.61150.005Horse HbControl00.0030.30.16310.01Reduction was initiated by putting the indicated sources of Fe(III) under 1 atm CO.

Open table in a new tab Reduction was initiated by putting the indicated sources of Fe(III) under 1 atm CO. The apparent first-order fast (k 1) and slow (k 2) rate constants were calculated by monitoring the spectral changes at 406 nm associated with reduction of Met (Fe(III)) heme and fitting the time courses to two exponential components. Controls are samples run in the absence of Cu(II). Unless otherwise noted, the samples were 13 μm in heme and were in 0.05 m Tris, pH 8.3, at 25 °C. When added, IHP was present at 40-fold excess over heme. The effects of varied levels of Cu(II) on the time courses of β heme reduction under CO were explored. As shown in Fig.2, with no copper present there is very little reduction of metHb A0 or metHb Deer Lodge after a 24-h incubation under CO (data shown only for Hb A0,open circles). The small extent of reduction of the copper-free metHb A0 control is consistent with our previous work that established the half-time for metHb A0reduction under CO to be about 1000 h at 1 atm pressure. When the process is carried out with a copper:heme ratio of 0.25, the process is only slightly increased in rate for Hb A0 but appreciably increased in rate for Hb Deer Lodge (β2His → Arg). The CO/H2O-driven reduction of metHb A0 occurs more quickly at elevated Cu(II) levels. As shown, at a copper:heme ratio of 0.7, approximately one-half of metHb A0 becomes reduced at a copper-enhanced rate, attributable to preferential reduction of the β chains (see above). The remainder of the reaction is ascribed to the reduction of the α chains. This much slower phase is less sensitive to copper addition. No efforts were made to investigate copper-Hb interactions at ratios above 1.0 copper:heme, since ratios greater than 0.5:heme can result in gradual protein precipitation (1Rifkind J.M. Sigel H. Metal Ions in Biological Systems. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1981: 191-232Google Scholar) and disulfide formation (2Winterbourn C.C. INSERM. 1977; 70: 97-106Google Scholar). The time courses of heme reduction observed over a 24-h period were generally well fit by assuming that they are composed of two exponential phases. Apparent rate constants for the two phases, obtained under varied conditions, are given in Table I. The apparent first-order rate constant of the first phase (k 1) reflects the Cu(II)-sensitive rate of β chain reduction. The apparent first-order rate constants for the second phase (k 2) are like those of the copper-free controls. The copper:heme ratios indicated in Table I were established by Cu(II) addition to thoroughly deoxygenated metHb samples (exceptions are indicated). Multiple stages of sequential de-aeration and purging with argon or nitrogen ensured that no oxygen was present in the samples before CO incubation was begun, generally about 20 min after copper addition. That reactive oxygen species are not involved in these reactions was verified by observing similar time courses of CO/H2O-driven reduction in the presence of added catalase and/or superoxide dismutase. Greatly enhanced rates of heme reduction for Cu(II)-metHb complexes under CO relative to samples without copper were observed in the Soret region with dilute samples (about 10 μm in heme) and in the 500–650-nm wavelength region with much more concentrated samples (about 500 μm in heme) in 2-mm path length cells. The phenomena observed are not artifacts of dissociation, as verified by observing similar behavior over a wide protein concentration range and use of high pressure liquid chromatography that showed no experimentally detectable subunit dissociation in the high concentration samples. At low levels of copper (≤0.25 copper:heme), the rate and extent of reduction of metHb Deer Lodge (closed squares in Fig. 2) are clearly more affected by copper addition than reduction of metHb A0 (closed circles). Horse Hb, also lacking His-β2 residues, behaves like Hb Deer Lodge in having an appreciable copper-enhanced phase of CO/H2O-driven reduction at 0.25 copper:heme (Fig. 2 and Table I). These results mirror the EPR results presented in the next section. The structural explanation for the difference in copper sensitivity exhibited by metHb A0, horse metHb, and metHb Deer Lodge is that the His-β2 residues of Hb A0 are key residues in high affinity copper-binding sites that are ineffective in electron exchange with the heme. Although there are theoretically two high affinity copper-binding sites per tetramer (0.5 copper per heme) in Hb A0, significant enhancement of its reduction rate under CO occurs at Cu(II) levels above 0.25 copper:heme, indicating a distribution of copper to the sites responsible for CO/H2O-driven reduction before all “high affinity” sites are filled. A similar copper concentration dependence was reported by Louro and co-workers (19Louro S.R.W. Perussi J.R. Tabak M. Stud. Biophys. 1986; 113: 75-84Google Scholar) in their studies of copper-induced oxidation of the β chains of Hb. Sample treatment can alter the time courses of CO-driven reduction by altering the distribution or access of copper to the “effective” copper-binding sites. As illustrated in Fig.3, significant inhibition of the copper effect occurs when copper-binding sites near the β93 sulfhydryl groups are blocked by treatment with N-ethylmaleimide (NEM). NEM treatment also results in a slight increase in the rate of reduction of the copper-free control. Variable time courses, presumably reflecting variable distribution of Cu(II) among the binding sites, can also be achieved by variations in sample handling, as illustrated by the two lower (faster) time courses of Fig. 3 where samples gave significantly different time courses of reduction as a consequence of different sample handling procedures. The rates and time courses (within experimental variability) of CO/H2O-driven reduction are unchanged when Cu(II)-metHb complexes are incubated under progressively lower CO levels over a range of solution concentrations from 1 to 0.05 mm CO. Within this range of CO concentrations, good isosbestic points are typically observed between the met and CO derivatives of Hb, and the decreases in absorbance at 406 nm (metHb disappearance) and the increases in absorbance at 419 nm (CO-Hb appearance) have the same time dependence. The CO concentration independence and the wavelength independence of the process together indicate that the Fe(III) (met) and CO-Hb forms are the only significantly populated species and that something other than CO concentration is rate-limiting in the transition toward CO-Hb. Intermediate species are, however, apparent when incubation is carried out at low CO levels and IHP is present. Under progressively lower CO concentrations (<0.25 mm) in the presence of IHP, the time courses observed at 406 and 419 nm become increasingly distinct, and the isosbestic point between met and CO-Hb is not maintained. We examined the CO/H2O-driven reduction of Cu(II) complexes of metHb A0 under a number of experimental conditions, with results summarized in Table I. Many of our experiments were performed at relatively low protein concentration (10–15 μm in heme) where the concentration of dimeric forms of metHb would be appreciable. Remarkably, there are no systematic differences in reduction rates when the heme concentration is varied over the range of 10 to 500 μm. This is evidence that the internal electron transfer responsible for heme reduction is governed by tertiary rather than quaternary conformational states. This conclusion was also supported by studies reported below, using T-state stabilization by IHP and R-state stabilization by digestion with carboxypeptidase A. Strong allosteric effectors such as inositol hexaphosphate (IHP) can shift R-state metHb toward the T-state (20Kilmartin J.V. Biochem. J. 1973; 133: 725-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). IHP addition results in an approximately 2-fold decrease in the half-time for the rapid (β chain) phase of reduction at pH 8.3. This suggested that copper-enhanced reduction of metHb might be slower in its T-state conformation. We then looked for possible pH effects on the IHP-induced changes in rate, since IHP stabilization of the T-state would be expected to be more evident at low pH. However, the rate of reduction in the presence of IHP is appreciably faster at pH 7 than at pH 8.3. The pH shift alone caused only a minor alteration in reduction rate. Lower rates of reduction would have occurred at pH 7 if the IHP effect was due to a T-state shift. The altered efficacy of Cu(II) in the presence of IHP thus does not follow the pattern expected for R ↔ T shifts of quaternary conformation. We further examined the possible effect of Hb conformation on the reductive process by monitoring the CO/H2O-driven reduction of metHb after modification by digestion with carboxypeptidase A (HbCPA). This digestion removes the C-terminal His and Tyr residues of the β chains, strongly stabilizes the R-state conformation, and inhibits the IHP-induced shift toward the T-state (21Antonini E. Brunori M. Hemoglobin and Myoglobin in Their Reactions With Ligands. North-Holland Publishing Co., Amsterdam1971Google Scholar, 22Chiancone E. Anderson N.M. Antonini E. Bonaventura J. Bonaventura C. Brunori M. Spagnuolo C. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 5689-5694Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). HbCPA controls behaved like the undigested protein, so that in the absence of copper metHbCPA became reduced under CO with an apparent rate constant similar to that of metHb A0 (k 2 = 0.006 h−1). In the presence of Cu(II) at 0.5 copper:heme, half-reduction of metHbCPA was enhanced in rate over that of the copper-free controls. The rate enhancement was relatively small, so that β chains became reduced at a rate about half that characteristic of the undigested protein. Constraining the protein to the R-state by this modification thus caused a decreased rate of reduction. Addition of IHP increased the rate to somewhat greater than observed for undigested protein in the absence of IHP, with a half-time for reduction of the fast phase of about 1 h. The rate increase brought about by IHP on the reduction of metHbCPA is in marked contrast to results obtained with metHb A0, where the reductive process is slowed by the presence of IHP (see Table I). We conclude from these comparative studies that the rate of reduction is governed by tertiary effects on the internal electron transfer pathway and not by the pattern of T ↔ R shifts of quaternary conformation that govern oxygen binding. The rate of the reductive process is clearly affected by the level of Cu(II) that is bound at a site that is effective in internal electron transfer. In our studies with metHbCPA, we noted that the magnitude of the fast phase of reduction is not as great as that for metHb A0 at a comparable copper:heme ratio. The reduced magnitude of the fast phase of reduction is probably due to sequestration"

Metal response elements (MREs) are essential for this induction, and these elements are present in multiple copies in the proximal promoters of MT genes. MREs were initially shown to mediate transcriptional response of MT genes to zinc and cadmium (7Stuart G.W. Searle P.F. Chen H.Y. Brinster R.L. Palmiter R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A protein that binds specifically to MREs and that transactivates MT gene expression has been identified in mouse and human and is termed MRE-binding transcription factor-1 (MTF-1) (10Brugnera E.

Targeted disruption of both MTF-1 alleles in mouse embryonic stem cells demonstrated its essential role for basal as well as heavy metal-induced MT gene expression (12Heuchel R. Radtke F. Georgiev O.

The 5′-flanking region of the mouse MT-I gene (mMT-I) also contains cis-acting elements that bind the trans-acting factors Sp1 and upstream stimulatory factor (USF). An antioxidant responsive element (ARE) overlaps the USF binding site, but the protein(s) that bind to the ARE have not been identified (9Dalton T. Palmiter R.D. Andrews G.K.

In this construct the TATA box and transcription start site are provided by the adenovirus major late minimal promoter. The mammalian expression vector CMV-mMTF-1 (24Johnson J.A. Nathanson N.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18856-18863Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was generated by inserting the mouse MTF-1 cDNA into the NotI site of a CMV expression vector kindly provided by Dr. James Smith (Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX). IMR-32 human neuroblastoma or HepG2 human hepatoma cells were plated at a density of 6.0 × 104 cells/well in 24-well plates and grown in 0.5 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Transient transfections using the calcium phosphate method were done as described previously (25Dalton T.P. Bittel D. Andrews G.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2781-2789Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). IMR-32 and HepG2 cells were cotransfected 72 and 48 h after plating, respectively, with 430 ng of promoter-driven reporter plasmids and 20 ng of CMV-β-galactosidase to correct for transfection efficiency. Cells were incubated overnight with the transfection mix and subsequently treated for 18–24 h. For dose-response studies, cells were treated with 0.1 mm HCl or increasing doses of cadmium or zinc in 0.1 mm HCl. Cells were also treated with 0.4% ethanol or increasing doses of tBHQ in ethanol. To down-regulate protein kinase C (PKC), cells were treated for 24 h prior to transfection with 0.4% ethanol or 1.0 μm phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate in ethanol. In the continued presence of phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, cells were transiently transfected, as described above, and treated with zinc (100 μm) or cadmium (IMR-32, 1.0 μm; HepG2, 2.0 μm). In all experiments, the medium was removed, and cells were lysed by freeze-thawing in 100 μl of extraction buffer (100 mm KPO4, pH 7.4, 4.0 mm ATP, 1.5 mm MgSO4, 1.0 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.1% Triton X-100). Cell lysates (25 μl) were added to 350 μl of luciferase assay buffer (100 mm KPO4, pH 7.4, 4.0 mm ATP, and 1.5 mm MgSO4), and then 100 μl of 1.0 mmd-Luciferin was injected into each culture tube by a luminometer that integrated the luminescence over 10 s. The β-galactosidase activity was measured using the Galacto-LightTM chemiluminescent reporter assay. Cell lysates (25 μl) were added to 100 μl of β-galactosidase reaction buffer (100 mm sodium phosphate, pH 8.0, 1 mmMgCl2, and GalactonTM) incubated for 35 min, and then 100 μL of EmeraldTM luminescence amplifier was injected by a luminometer, which integrated the luminescence over 5 s. The data are expressed as a ratio of luciferase to β-galactosidase activities or are presented as the fold activation relative to the vehicle control. Statistics were performed using the Student's t test (p < 0.05). EMSAs were performed using whole cell extracts prepared as described previously (26Zimarino V. Wu C.

IMR-32 human neuroblastoma cells or Hepa mouse hepatoma cells were plated at a density of 3.0 × 106 cells in 100-mm dishes. IMR-32 cells were grown in 10 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, and mouse Hepa cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 2% fetal bovine serum. Protein concentration was determined using the BCA protein kit (Pierce). Whole cell extracts (20 μg of protein in 1 μl) or zinc-activated MTF-1 from an in vitro transcription/translation reaction (1 μl of a 50-μl reaction) were incubated in buffer containing 12 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 60 mm KCl, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 12% glycerol, 5 mmMgCl2, 0.2 μg of poly(dI-dC)/μg protein, 8 fmol of end-labeled double-stranded oligonucleotide (5000 cpm/fmol) in a total volume of 20 μl for 20 min on ice (8Dalton T.P.

Georgiev O. Hergersberg M. Gariglio M. Dembic Z. Schaffner W. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1355-1362Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). Protein-DNA complexes were separated at 4 °C using 4% polyacrylamide gel (acrylamide:bisacrylamide 80:1) electrophoresis at 15 V/cm. The gel was polymerized and run in buffer consisting of 0.19m glycine, 25 mm Tris (pH 8.5), 0.5 mm EDTA. After electrophoresis, the gel was dried, and labeled complexes were detected by autoradiography. IMR-32 human neuroblastoma cells were transfected with a −150 mMT-1-luciferase reporter construct and treated with tBHQ, cadmium, and zinc (Fig. 1). Cadmium activated the −150 mMT-1-luciferase reporter 20–25-fold at doses of 0.5–2.0 μm (Fig. 1 B) In contrast, tBHQ did not change the luciferase expression (Fig. 1 A), and zinc caused only a modest but statistically significant increase of 1.6–2.0-fold (Fig. 1 C). Activation of the mMT-I promoter by heavy metals and oxidative stress in Hepa cells has been attributed to interaction between MTF-1 and MRE (7Stuart G.W. Searle P.F. Chen H.Y. Brinster R.L.

Thus, the absence of functional MTF-1 in IMR-32 cells could account for the lack of responsiveness to zinc and/or tBHQ. The hypothesis that this human neuroblastoma cell line has no functional MTF-1 was evaluated by EMSAs on whole cell extracts from IMR-32 cells compared with mouse Hepa cells (Fig.2). Whole cell extracts were prepared from vehicle-treated, 10 μm tBHQ-treated, 1.0 μm cadmium-treated, and 100 μm zinc-treated cells (2 and 8 h). IMR-32 cell extracts did not contain detectable MRE binding activity at either 2 h (Fig. 2, lanes 2–5) or 8 h (Fig. 2, lanes 6–9). As has been demonstrated previously (8Dalton T.P. Li Q. Bittel D. Liang L. Andrews G.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26233-26241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 24Johnson J.A. Nathanson N.M. J. Biol.

We have previously shown that addition of unlabeled MRE oligonucleotide competes for the MRE·MTF-1 complex (8Dalton T.P. Li Q. Bittel D. Liang L. Andrews G.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26233-26241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar) and that the MRE·MTF-1 complex is supershifted specifically by a polyclonal antibody raised against MTF-1 (28Lee D.K. Carrasco J. Hidalgo J. Andrews G.K. Biochem. J. 1998; 337: 59-65Crossref Google Scholar). MRE·MTF-1 binding activity can be increased in vitro by addition of exogenous zinc to whole cell extracts from untreated cells (8Dalton T.P. Li Q. Bittel D. Liang L. Andrews G.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26233-26241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 24Johnson J.A. Nathanson N.M. J. Biol.

Chem. 1998; 273: 7127-7133Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Incubation of IMR-32 extracts with zinc in vitro did not generate a MTF-1·MRE complex (Fig.3, lane 6). In contrast, treatment of Hepa control cell extract with zinc in vitroresulted in a large increase in MRE binding activity (Fig. 3,lanes 5 and 9). A possible explanation for these results is that IMR-32 cells contain an inhibitor of MTF-1 activation and subsequent MRE·MTF-1 complex formation. A combined whole cell extract was prepared from a mixture of IMR-32 and Hepa cells to test this possibility (Fig. 3, lanes 4 and 8). The IMR-32 cell extract had no effect on activation of MTF-1 in Hepa cell extract, implying that IMR-32 cells do not possess a constitutively expressed repressor of MTF-1 activation. We have recently demonstrated that the USF/ARE from the mMT-I promoter participates in cadmium-mediated induction of mMT-I in Hepa cells and that this composite site does not contribute to induction of mMT-1 by zinc (13Li Q. Hu N. Daggett M.A.F. Chu W. Johnson J.A. Andrews G.K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 5182-5189Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). IMR-32 cells were transfected with −150 mMT-1-luciferase, −150ΔUSF/ARE-luciferase, and USF/ARE-luciferase reporter constructs to determine the role of USF/ARE in cadmium-mediated activation of mMT-1 promoter (TableI). Deletion of the USF/ARE from the intact −150 mMT-I promoter sequence had no effect on induction of luciferase by cadmium in IMR-32 cells. The −150 mMT-I-luciferase reporter and −150ΔUSF/ARE-luciferase were activated 21.5- and 20.3-fold, respectively (Table I). In addition, the isolated USF/ARE element in a heterologous promoter construct was not activated by cadmium (Table I). Because the IMR-32 cells apparently do not have functional MTF-1, the MREd5-luciferase was included to serve as a negative control. Contrary to this assumption, the data showed that MREd5-luciferase was activated 30.2-fold by treatment with 1.0 μm cadmium (Table I). Thus, cadmium-mediated transcriptional activation of mMT-1 promoter is MRE-dependent, yet MTF-1-independent in IMR-32 neuroblastoma cells.Table ITranscriptional activation of the MT promoter by cadmium is dependent on the MRE and independent of the USF/AREDNA constructLuciferase/β-galactosidase ratio (×10−3)Fold activationVehicletBHQ (10 μm)Cadmium (1.0 μm)Zinc (100 μm)tBHQCadmiumZinc−150-mMT-11.33 ± 0.051.20 ± 0.03aSignificantly different from the corresponding vehicle-treated cells (p < 0.05).28.6 ± 0.57aSignificantly different from the corresponding vehicle-treated cells (p < 0.05).2.02 ± 0.08aSignificantly different from the corresponding vehicle-treated cells (p < 0.05).0.9021.51.52−150ΔUSF/ARE0.59 ± 0.020.60 ± 0.0212.0 ± 0.49aSignificantly different from the corresponding vehicle-treated cells (p < 0.05).1.22 ± 0.04aSignificantly different from the corresponding vehicle-treated cells (p < 0.05).NS20.32.07USF/ARE0.70 ± 0.040.72 ± 0.050.72 ± 0.050.80 ± 0.04NSNSNSMREd50.45 ± 0.030.29 ± 0.02aSignificantly different from the corresponding vehicle-treated cells (p < 0.05).13.6 ± 1.30aSignificantly different from the corresponding vehicle-treated cells (p < 0.05).0.89 ± 0.06aSignificantly different from the corresponding vehicle-treated cells (p < 0.05).0.6430.21.98IMR-32 cells were plated at a density of 6.0 × 104cells/well in 24-well plates and grown in 0.5 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum.

IMR-32 cells were cotransfected with increasing concentrations of a mammalian expression vector for mMTF-1 (CMV-mMTF-1) and the MREd5-luciferase reporter construct (Fig.4). Basal level expression of the MRE-driven fusion construct was significantly increased in a dose-dependent manner with increasing concentrations of CMV-mMTF-1 (Fig. 4 A). At a concentration of 20 ng of CMV-mMTF-1/well there was a 9-fold increase in basal level transcription of the MRE. In addition, overexpression of MTF-1 regenerated a zinc-mediated induction of the MREd5-luciferase reporter gene (Fig. 4 B). The magnitude of zinc induction was 9-fold and maximal at 1 ng of CMV-mMTF-1. Notably, overexpression of mMTF-1 had no effect on activation of MREd5-luciferase by cadmium and actually significantly decreased the extent of activation with increasing doses of CMV-mMTF-1 (Fig. 4 B). To validate that the observed effects in IMR-32 cells were not due to differences between rodent and human MTF-1, we transfected HepG2 human hepatoma cells with MREd5-luciferase and treated them with zinc and cadmium. Zinc and cadmium transcriptionally activated the MREd5-driven luciferase expression by 17- and 30-fold, respectively, in HepG2 human hepatoma cells (Fig.5). Thus, HepG2 cells express functional human MTF-1 that is activated by zinc, whereas this transcription factor is apparently not functional or not expressed in IMR-32 cells. Based on these data, we wanted to determine whether activation of the MRE in IMR-32 cells was cadmium-specific. In addition to cadmium, we tested copper sulfate (5–200 μm), sodium arsenite (5–200 μm), sodium dichromate (0.1–20 μm), cobalt chloride (5–200 μm), nickel chloride (5–200 μm), lead acetate (0.1–50 μm), mercuric chloride (0.5–20 μm), manganese chloride (0.5–25 μm), bismuth nitrate (1–200 μm), and ferric chloride (5–200 μm). IMR-32 cells transfected with −150 mMT-1-luciferase or MREd5-luciferase were treated with the above compounds, but only cadmium caused a significant increase in luciferase expression (data not shown). Recently, Yu and co-workers (29Yu C.W. Chen J.H. Lin L.Y. FEBS Lett. 1997; 420: 69-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) showed that metal-induced MT gene expression can be inactivated by PKC inhibitors. IMR-32 cells and HepG2 cells were PKC down-regulated by chronic treatment with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, transfected with MREd5-luciferase reporter, and treated with zinc and cadmium (Table II). In HepG2 cells, cadmium-mediated activation of the MRE was completely blocked by PKC down-regulation, and zinc-mediated activation was significantly reduced from 20.5-fold in control cells to 3.12-fold in PKC down-regulated cells. In contrast, PKC down-regulation in the IMR-32 cells had no effect on activation of the MRE by cadmium (Table II). Similarly, pretreatment of IMR-32 cells with the PKC inhibitors H7 and GF109203X had no effect on cadmium-mediated activation of the MRE (data not shown).Table IIEffect of PKC down-regulation on zinc- and cadmium-mediated activation of MREd5-luciferasePretreatmentLuciferase/β-galactosidase ratio (×10−3)Fold activationVehicleZincCadmiumZincCadmiumIMR-32 cellsEthanol0.48 ± 0.01ND15.1 ± 1.20bSignificantly different from the corresponding vehicle-treated cells (p < 0.05).31.1PMA0.66 ± 0.03aSignificantly different from the corresponding ethanol-treated cells (p < 0.05).ND21.7 ± 1.24aSignificantly different from the corresponding ethanol-treated cells (p < 0.05).,bSignificantly different from the corresponding vehicle-treated cells (p < 0.05).32.9HepG2 cellsEthanol7.38 ± 0.35151 ± 21.2bSignificantly different from the corresponding vehicle-treated cells (p < 0.05).148 ± 11.9bSignificantly different from the corresponding vehicle-treated cells (p < 0.05).20.520.0PMA9.56 ± 1.69aSignificantly different from the corresponding ethanol-treated cells (p < 0.05).29.8 ± 3.40aSignificantly different from the corresponding ethanol-treated cells (p < 0.05).,bSignificantly different from the corresponding vehicle-treated cells (p < 0.05).13.2 ± 2.18aSignificantly different from the corresponding ethanol-treated cells (p < 0.05).3.12NSIMR-32 or HepG2 cells were plated at a density of 6.0 × 104 cells/well in 24-well plates and grown in 0.5 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. 48 h after plating, cells were treated with ethanol or 1 μm PMA and transiently transfected 24 h later.

These data demonstrate that zinc and cadmium have independent mechanisms for activation of the mMT-I promoter in IMR-32 cells. Because cotransfection of the mMT-I reporter constructs with a mammalian expression vector containing mMTF-1 restored zinc responsiveness to the IMR-32 cells, the lack of a zinc effect can be attributed to absence of functional MTF-1 in this cell type. Interestingly, cadmium-driven activation of the MRE was not dependent upon the presence of functional MTF-1 and was actually attenuated by increased overexpression of MTF-1. Finally, this MTF-1-independent mechanism was specific for cadmium and not mediated through activation of PKC in IMR-32 cells. In sharp contrast to our findings in IMR-32 cells, MTF-1, a zinc finger transcription factor, has been shown to be essential in mediating transcriptional activation of MT genes by zinc and cadmium in embryonic stem cells and BHK cells (12Heuchel R. Radtke F. Georgiev O. Stark G. Aguet M. Schaffner W. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2870-2875Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar, 30Palmiter R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1219-1223Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). These transition metals are the most potent activators of mouse MT expression in many cell types and are proposed to converge on the MRE through MTF-1 activation. Furthermore, expression of MT-I and MT-II genes in MTF-1 null embryonic stem cells could not be increased by treatment with zinc, cadmium, copper, nickel, or lead, and there was no detectable basal level expression of either MT gene (12Heuchel R. Radtke F. Georgiev O. Stark G. Aguet M. Schaffner W. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2870-2875Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). These data suggest that MTF-1·MRE complex formation is essential for basal expression and induction of MT genes. Zinc can reversibly and directly activate the DNA binding activity of MTF-1 (24Johnson J.A. Nathanson N.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18856-18863Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the extent of MTF-1 binding activity is rapidly increased, as is occupancy of MRE in the mMT-I promoter, after treatment of cells with zinc (8Dalton T.P. Li Q. Bittel D. Liang L. Andrews G.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26233-26241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). In contrast to zinc (8Dalton T.P. Li Q. Bittel D. Liang L. Andrews G.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26233-26241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 24Johnson J.A. Nathanson N.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18856-18863Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), cadmium has little effect on the amount of MTF-1 binding activity in Hepa or HeLa cell extracts (27Bittel D. Dalton T. Samson S.L. Gedamu L. Andrews G.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7127-7133Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Similarly, the DNA binding activity of recombinant human and mouse MTF-1 to MRE in vitro is also dependent on zinc and not facilitated by cadmium (27Bittel D. Dalton T. Samson S.L. Gedamu L. Andrews G.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7127-7133Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). These data support the hypothesis that cadmium may be activating MT genes by a mechanism distinct from that of zinc. Fortuitously, we found that zinc did not transcriptionally activate mMT-1-luciferase reporter constructs in IMR-32 human neuroblastoma. But as was seen in the MTF-1 null embryonic stem cells (12Heuchel R. Radtke F. Georgiev O. Stark G. Aguet M. Schaffner W. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2870-2875Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar), transfection of recombinant mMTF-1 into IMR-32 cells restored the zinc-mediated activation of mMT-1 reporters and increased their basal level expression. Indeed, it would appear that increased expression of MTF-1 actually attenuated transcriptional activation of the MRE by cadmium and zinc (Fig. 4 B). Because both zinc and cadmium are affected and there is a corresponding increase in basal level expression of the luciferase reporter (Fig. 4 A), we hypothesize that the greater the basal level expression (increased occupancy of the MRE by MTF-1) the lesser the induction of the MRE-luciferase reporter. This can certainly explain the effect of MTF-1 overexpression on zinc activation but also implies that activation of the MRE by cadmium can be competed for by MTF-1, suggesting that MTF-1 can effectively block the interaction of cadmium-responsive transcription factor(s) with the MRE. The mechanism(s) by which cadmium activates the MRE in IMR-32 cells remains to be determined. The MRE may also bind the basal transcription factor Sp1 and zinc-regulated factor (31Remondelli P. Moltedo O. Leone A. FEBS Lett. 1997; 416: 254-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). We examined Sp1 by transfecting IMR-32 cells with a heterologous promoter construct containing the Sp1 consensus DNA binding site. This Sp1-luciferase reporter construct was not activated by cadmium, zinc, or tBHQ in the IMR-32 cells (data not shown), suggesting that the binding of Sp1 is not involved in activation of the MRE by cadmium in IMR-32 cells. The zinc-regulated factor is distinct from MTF-1 and was isolated from the mouse for its ability to activate MRE-driven reporter gene expression in yeast (31Remondelli P. Moltedo O. Leone A. FEBS Lett. 1997; 416: 254-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). A human homolog of the zinc-regulated factor has not been described, and the effects of cadmium versus zinc on its MRE binding activity has not been examined. Yu and co-workers (29Yu C.W. Chen J.H. Lin L.Y. FEBS Lett. 1997; 420: 69-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) demonstrated that metal-induced MT gene expression was blocked by inhibitors of PKC. The relatively nonspecific inhibitor of PKC, H7, blocked induction of MT by cadmium and zinc. The effect on zinc-mediated induction was due to a lack of uptake. H7 blocked the cellular accumulation of zinc. In contrast, the cellular accumulation of cadmium was unaffected by H7 pretreatment, suggesting that PKC could play an important role in regulating induction of MT by cadmium. We clearly show that PKC is not involved in the cadmium-mediated activation of MT reporters in IMR-32 cells. However, in HepG2 cells, the transcriptional activation of MRE reporter by cadmium is completely blocked by PKC down-regulation. Therefore, PKC is important in HepG2 cells but not in IMR-32 cells with respect to cadmium-mediated induction of MT gene expression. Alternatively, cadmium can stimulate myosin light chain kinase (32Chao S.H. Bu C.H. Cheung W.Y. Arch.

Lett. 1982; 10: 133-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The possible role for these pathways in mediating cadmium-driven MRE activation in IMR-32 cells has not been evaluated. Others have reported differential gene activation in response to treatment with zinc versus cadmium (36Cigliano S. Remondelli P. Minichiello L. Mellone M.C. Martire G. Bonatti S. Leone A. Exp. Cell. Res. 1996; 228: 173-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). These investigators demonstrate that in HeLa-derived cadmium-resistant cells, cadmium but not zinc increases Hsp70 and GRP78 expression. In addition, a cis-acting element responsible for cadmium-mediated induction of human heme oxygenase in HeLa cells has been identified (cadmium response element) (37Takeda K. Ishizawa S. Sato M. Yoshida T. Shibahara S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22858-22867Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 38Takeda K. Fujita H. Shibahara S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 207: 160-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The core sequence is different from the MRE. EMSAs show that a protein constitutively associates with the cadmium response element, the DNA binding activity is not altered by cadmium, and the cadmium response element binding protein does not bind to the MRE. Furthermore, cadmium response element-luciferase reporters are activated by cadmium but not zinc, whereas MRE-luciferase reporters are activated by both cadmium and zinc in HeLa cells (38Takeda K. Fujita H. Shibahara S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 207: 160-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Thus, it is obvious that cadmium and zinc can activate different genes through specific pathways/response elements. The clear separation of cadmium and zinc pathways for MT induction in IMR-32 neuroblastoma cells indicates that MRE activation by cadmium is not only independent of MTF-1 but also of zinc. Targeted disruption of the MTF-1 locus is lethal to embryos at embryonic day 14 (39Günes C. Heuchel R. Georgiev O. Muller K.H. Lichtlen P. Bluthmann H. Marino S. Aguzzi A. Schaffner W. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2846-2854Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). The MTF-1 null embryos are devoid of MT-I and MT-II expression and have significantly reduced basal levels of γ-glutamylcysteine synthetase but normal expression of Sp1. Primary cultures of mouse embryo fibroblasts and established mouse embryo fibroblast cells lines from the MTF-1 null embryos were shown to have increased susceptibility to cadmium-induced cytotoxicity (39Günes C. Heuchel R. Georgiev O. Muller K.H. Lichtlen P. Bluthmann H. Marino S. Aguzzi A. Schaffner W. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2846-2854Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). The effect of cadmium on expression of MT genes in these MTF-1 null mouse embryo fibroblasts was not evaluated. Based on our data, there is an alternative mechanism by which to activate the MRE and MT gene expression independent of MTF-1 expression. MTF-1-independent activation of the MRE may be cell type-specific, and thus it is very important to determine whether cadmium increases expression of MT genes in MTF-1 null mouse embryo fibroblasts. Comparison of these data with the data generated in IMR-32 cells should help us begin to sort out the mechanism of activation by cadmium versus zinc. In conclusion, the data presented herein reveal a novel pathway for the induction of MT gene expression and MRE activation by cadmium. The relationship of these data to the regulation of MTs and other MRE-driven genes in vivo remains open to speculation."

However, the relationship between extracellular and intracellular domain oligomerization remains poorly understood. To assess the requirements for dimerization of receptor cytoplasmic sequences for signaling, we overexpressed mutant EPORs in combination with wild-type (WT) EPOR to drive formation of heterodimeric (i.e. WT-mutant) receptor complexes. Dimerization of the membrane-proximal portion of the EPOR cytoplasmic region was found to be critical for the initiation of mitogenic signaling. However, dimerization of the entire EPOR cytoplasmic region was not required. To examine this process more closely, we generated chimeras between the intracellular and transmembrane portions of the EPOR and the extracellular domains of the interleukin-2 receptor β and γc chains. These chimeras allowed us to assess more precisely the signaling role of each receptor chain because only heterodimers of WT and mutant receptor chimeras form in the presence of interleukin-2. Coexpression studies demonstrated that a functional receptor complex requires the membrane-proximal region of each receptor subunit in the oligomer to permit activation of JAK2 but only one membrane-distal tail to activate STAT5 and to support cell proliferation. Thus, this study defines key relationships involved in the assembly and activation of the EPOR signal transduction complex which may be applicable to other homodimeric cytokine receptors.

The erythropoietin receptor (EPOR) belongs to the cytokine receptor superfamily and as such contains the structural motifs of four cysteine residues with canonical spacing and the sequence WSXWS in the extracellular domain (4Cosman D.

Nature. 1995; 377: 591-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (1144) Google Scholar), the cytoplasmic regions of these receptors lack intrinsic enzymatic activity. Signal transduction instead is mediated by cytoplasmic protein tyrosine kinases of the JAK family (7Ihle J.N. Adv. Immunol. 1995; 60: 1-35Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These kinases are constitutively associated with receptor chains; residues in the membrane-proximal region of the EPOR cytoplasmic tail are required for this association. Ligand binding results in homodimerization of EPOR chains, which is critical for the initiation of intracellular signaling (8Barber D.L. Corless C.N. Xia K. Roberts T.M. D'Andrea A.D.

The role of homodimerization in the initiation of signaling is highlighted by constitutively active variants of the EPOR chain (10Watowich S.S. Hilton D.J. Lodish H.F. Mol. Cell.

In the three mutants described to date, R129C, E132C, and E133C, amino acids in the extracellular domain are replaced by cysteines, leading to the formation of intermolecular disulfide bridges and constitutive signaling. In contrast, a number of other cytokine receptors signal through the heterodimerization of asymmetric receptor chains. For example, interleukin-2 (IL-2) binds and heterodimerizes the IL-2Rβ and γc receptor chains (for review, see Refs. 14Gaffen S.L. Goldsmith M.A. Greene W.C. Thomson A. The Cytokine Handbook. Academic Press, London1998: 73-103Google Scholarand 15Leonard W.J. Annu. Rev. Med. 1996; 47: 229-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). One of the earliest detectable signaling events induced by the EPOR is the phosphorylation of cellular proteins on tyrosines. This phosphorylation is thought to be mediated largely by JAK2, although other protein tyrosine kinases may also be involved (16Tilbrook P.A. Ingley E. Williams J.H. Hibbs M.L. Klinken S.P. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1610-1619Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Eight tyrosine residues are present in the membrane-distal portion of the EPOR cytoplasmic tail, and several of these have been identified as docking sites for signaling molecules with phosphotyrosine binding motifs, including STAT5, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase p85 subunit, and SHP-1 (17Chin H.

Recruitment of these molecules to the EPOR/JAK2 complex leads to the activation of several signaling cascades, most likely through a change in subcellular localization, tyrosine phosphorylation, and/or oligomerization. In addition, tyrosine-phosphorylated JAK2 may interact directly with certain signaling molecules, including the recently described CIS/JAB/SOCS family of proteins which may be important for the down-regulation of signaling (22Starr R.

Although it is clear that ligand-induced dimerization of the EPOR extracellular region is required to initiate signal transduction (9Livnah O. Stura E.A. Johnson D.L. Middleton S.A. Mulcahy L.S.

Biol. 1994; 14: 2257-2265Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), the functional requirements for signaling with regard to the oligomerization of cytoplasmic tails are unknown. To address this question, we coexpressed wild-type (WT) and mutant EPORs in the 32D cell line. We selected cell lines in which the mutant receptors were expressed at 10-fold higher levels than WT receptors to favor the formation of mutant-WT heterodimers for further analysis (10Watowich S.S. Hilton D.J. Lodish H.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3535-3549Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). This strategy allowed us to examine the relative capacities of heterodimeric EPORs to support EPO-dependent cellular proliferation. The roles of these cytoplasmic tails were then established definitively using a chimeric receptor system in which the identity of the extracellular domains forces only heterodimerization of cytoplasmic receptor chains. These two assay systems demonstrated that dimerization of the membrane-proximal region of the EPOR cytoplasmic tail is required for signal transduction, whereas a monomer of the membrane-distal region is sufficient for receptor-specific signaling. Thus, the distal portion of the activated receptor can function as a monomeric scaffold to recruit signaling molecules that are critical for inducing cell proliferation. pME18S STAT5A was the generous gift of Dr. A. Mui. The pEFBOS JAK2 expression vector was the kind gift of Dr. D. Wojchowski. The EPOR mutant 1–321 was generated by exonuclease digestion using the Erase-a-base kit (Promega Corp., Madison, WI). Dideoxy sequence analysis demonstrated that the EPOR 1–321 mutant contains residues 1–320 of the WT EPOR plus an additional 14 amino acids (EINNCTALTGAGGQ) at the carboxyl terminus which are not encoded by the WT EPOR. These residues are the result of the mutagenesis procedure and are followed by a termination codon. To construct the EPOR mutant W282R (28Miura O. Cleveland J.L. Ihle J.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1788-1795Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), EPOR cDNA was digested withPvuII and BamHI and ligated to a synthetic, double-stranded oligonucleotide encoding the W282R point mutation. EPOR mutants were subcloned into the mammalian expression vector pMEX as described previously (10Watowich S.S. Hilton D.J. Lodish H.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3535-3549Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). A modified form of the pEFBOS vector (29Mizushima S. Nagata S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 5322Crossref PubMed Scopus (1502) Google Scholar) containing the murine IL-3 signal sequence and the FLAG epitope tag was generously provided by Doug Hilton and Clare McFarlane (Walter and Eliza Hall Institute, Melbourne, Australia). To generate βEPOR, the extracellular region of the human IL-2Rβ chain (encoding residues 1–214 of the mature protein) was amplified by the polymerase chain reaction and subcloned into the modified pEFBOS vector, downstream of the FLAG epitope tag. The transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains of the murine EPOR (encoding residues 226–483 of the mature protein) were amplified by polymerase chain reaction; this fragment was subcloned into the pEFBOS vector 3′ to the IL-2Rβ chain extracellular region. The resulting construct (pEFBOS.S.FLAGβE) contains the IL-3 signal sequence at the amino terminus, followed in-frame by the FLAG epitope tag, the IL-2Rβ extracellular region, and the EPOR transmembrane and cytoplasmic regions. Additional amino acids (TR or VD) were introduced in between the epitope tag and the IL-2Rβ extracellular domain, and the IL-2Rβ extracellular region and EPOR transmembrane domain, respectively, by the subcloning procedure. βEPORs containing the 1–321 or W282R mutations were generated by swapping restriction fragments within the EPOR cytoplasmic domain. Sequences of the βEPOR constructs were confirmed by dideoxy sequence analysis. The murine γccDNA was the kind gift of Dr. T. Kono. To construct the murine γc-EPOR chimera, the transmembrane and intracellular domains of the EPOR were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (from amino acid residue 252 of the mature protein to the stop codon) with oligonucleotides inserting unique 5′ (BsmI) and 3′ (XbaI) restriction sites. This fragment was used to replace the corresponding transmembrane and intracellular domains of murine γc, and the construct was verified by DNA sequencing. To generate the γEPOR 1–321 chimera, theKpnI-BglII fragment of γEPOR and theBglII-XbaI fragment of βEPOR 1–321were cloned into the KpnI and XbaI sites of pCMV4neo. The sequence of this construct was confirmed by automated DNA sequencing. Expression of chimeric proteins and EPOR was confirmed by COS-7 cell transfection and immunoprecipitation experiments (see below). 32D is a well described IL-3-dependent myeloid cell line (30Dexter T.M. Garland J. Scott D. Scolnick E. Metcalf D. J. Exp. Med. 1980; 152: 1036-1047Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar). Stable transfectants expressing WT or mutant EPORs were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (FCS) and 5% conditioned medium from the WEHI 3B cell line (RPMI/FCS/WEHI), the latter as a source of IL-3. 32Dn20 cells express the WT EPOR from the pXM vector (10Watowich S.S. Hilton D.J. Lodish H.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3535-3549Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). To establish cell lines coexpressing WT and mutant EPORs, 32Dn20 cells were electroporated (using a Bio-Rad Gene Pulser apparatus) with pMEX containing mutant EPOR cDNAs, using conditions described previously (10Watowich S.S. Hilton D.J. Lodish H.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3535-3549Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Transfected cells were selected by growth in RPMI/FCS/WEHI containing 500 μg/ml G418 (Life Technologies), and clonal cell lines were isolated by limiting dilution. Expression of the mutant EPORs was verified by EPOR immunoprecipitations from metabolically labeled cells (11Watowich S.S. Yoshimura A. Longmore G.D. Hilton D.J. Yoshimura Y. Lodish H.F. Proc. Natl.

First, cells were electroporated with pEFBOS.S.FLAGβE and pSV2NEO, and stably transfected cells selected by growth in RPMI/FCS/WEHI containing 500 μg/ml G418. G418-resistant cells were then electroporated with pBABE/Puro and pCMV/γEPOR or pCMV/γEPOR 1–321.

These cells were cultured as described previously in Dulbecco's minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% FCS, 100 IU/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 700 μg/ml G418. These cells were transfected using calcium phosphate as described previously (32Liu K.D. Gaffen S.L. Goldsmith M.A. Greene W.C. Curr.

The ability of the EPOR-expressing cell lines to confer EPO-dependent proliferation was tested by short term proliferation assays as described previously (10Watowich S.S. Hilton D.J. Lodish H.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3535-3549Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). To examine IL-2-dependent proliferation in cell lines coexpressing βEPOR and γEPOR or γEPOR 1–321, cells were washed three times with RPMI/FCS and then plated in RPMI/FCS supplemented with IL-2 at the indicated concentrations (see figure legends). Cells were passaged for up to 2 weeks in IL-2-containing media. The culture density was maintained under 106 cells/ml by dilution in fresh medium. Viable cells, as judged by trypan blue dye exclusion, were counted every 2–3 days, and total cell numbers were graphed to determine doubling times. All cell lines used in this study were strictly growth factor-dependent and died after 24 h in RPMI/FCS. Antiserum specific for the amino- or carboxyl-terminal region of the murine EPOR has been described previously (33Yoshimura A. Longmore G. Lodish H.F.

Lysates were cleared by centrifugation and incubation with protein A-agarose beads and immunoprecipitations performed as described previously (10Watowich S.S. Hilton D.J. Lodish H.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3535-3549Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). For IL-2 stimulation, cells were washed and cultured in serum-free RPMI for 4 h at 37 °C and then stimulated with 10 nmIL-2 for 8–10 min at room temperature. Proteins were immunoprecipitated from cell lysates, separated by electrophoresis on 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, and transferred to nitrocellulose filters. The filters were blocked in buffer containing 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA), 1 × phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and 0.2% Tween 20 (BSA/PBS/Tween) for 60 min at room temperature. The filters were incubated with 4G10 antibody (1:1,000 dilution in BSA/PBS/Tween) at 4 °C overnight, washed twice (15 min each) in 1 × TBS containing 0.2% Tween 20. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse secondary antibody (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) (1:10,000 dilution in BSA/PBS/Tween) was incubated with the filters for 60 min at room temperature. Filters were washed as described above and were developed with chemiluminescent reagents (Pierce Chemical Co.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. To label proteins metabolically, cells were washed with methionine/cysteine-free medium and then incubated in methionine/cysteine-free medium supplemented with 500 μCi/ml [35S]methionine and -cysteine for 2 h. Proteins were immunoprecipitated, separated by SDS-PAGE, and the gels were fluorographed, dried, and exposed to x-ray film. 48 h after transfection, cells were stimulated with the appropriate cytokine at the indicated concentration for 10 min at 37 °C and then harvested.

For supershift analyses, the nuclear extract was preincubated with antibody for 45 min on ice before the addition of the radiolabeled probe. Purified rabbit IgG specific for STAT5 (C-17) was obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. To determine the functional requirements for oligomerization of the EPOR cytoplasmic tails, we coexpressed WT and cytoplasmic tail mutant EPORs in 32D cells. In previous studies, truncation mutants lacking the majority of sequences in the cytoplasmic domain of the EPOR dominantly inhibited EPO-induced cellular proliferation when coexpressed in excess with the WT receptor, indicating that these mutants heterodimerize with the WT receptor and block signal transduction from the cell surface (10Watowich S.S.

Biol. 1994; 14: 2257-2265Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Therefore, the coexpression of WT EPOR and less severe truncation mutants should clarify whether a dimer of the full-length EPOR cytoplasmic tail is required for receptor functions involved in cellular proliferation, or if growth signaling can be activated through asymmetric configurations of the EPOR intracellular domains. IL-3-dependent 32D cells that express the WT EPOR proliferate in response to stimulation with either EPO or IL-3 (10Watowich S.S. Hilton D.J. Lodish H.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3535-3549Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). We constructed the EPOR mutants shown in Fig.1 A, and the ability of these mutants to support EPO-dependent proliferation alone or in combination with the WT receptor was assessed in 32D cells. When expressed singly, the EPOR 1–257, EPOR 1–321, and EPOR W282R mutants were displayed on the cell surface at levels comparable to WT EPOR (600–1,700 sites/cell), indicating that the biosynthesis of these mutants is relatively normal. In addition, these mutants have WT affinity for EPO (K d 200–400 pm) (data not shown). The EPOR 1–257 and EPOR W282R mutants were unable to support EPO-dependent proliferation when expressed alone (Fig. 1 A). Expression of the EPOR 1–321 mutant maintained the viability of cells and permitted weak proliferation in only saturating concentrations of EPO (Figs. 1 A and2).Figure 2EPO-dependent proliferation of 32D cell lines expressing WT and mutant receptors. 32D cells expressing only WT, 1–321, or W282R, or coexpressing WT and 1–321 or WT and W282R were assayed for growth in concentrations of EPO ranging from 0.005 to 10 μm/ml, over a 3-day period. The level of proliferation is expressed as a percentage of the total cell number in parallel cultures containing IL-3 (for details, see “Experimental Procedures”).

Panel B, growth of cells expressing WT, W282R, or coexpressing WT and W282R.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To generate coexpressing cells, a 32D cell line that expresses low levels of WT EPOR (32Dn20) was transfected with the mutants shown in Fig. 1 A. Multiple clonal lines coexpressing WT and mutant EPORs were isolated. To determine the relative levels of WT and mutant EPOR expression in each cell line, proteins were metabolically labeled with [35S]methionine and -cysteine, immunoprecipitated with antiserum specific for the EPOR, and separated by SDS-PAGE. We selected cell lines in which the mutant receptors are expressed at 5–10-fold higher levels than the WT EPOR for further analysis (Fig.1 B). At this ratio of expression, EPOR 1–257 functions readily as a dominant inhibitor of WT EPOR-mediated proliferation (10Watowich S.S. Hilton D.J. Lodish H.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3535-3549Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). To test the ability of these mutants to inhibit dominantly proliferation mediated by the WT receptor, cells coexpressing WT and mutant EPORs were cultured in media containing 10 units/ml EPO or IL-3 for 3 days. Interestingly, the truncation mutant EPOR 1–321, which was unable to support a significant level of EPO-dependent proliferation when expressed on its own, failed to block proliferative signaling (Figs. 1 A and 2). However, a full-length form of the EPOR containing the single point mutation W282R in the cytoplasmic tail exerted potent dominant inhibitory effects (Figs. 1 Aand 2). To determine the EPO dose-response profiles of clonal cell lines coexpressing the WT receptor and EPOR 1–321 or EPOR W282R, we assayed the growth of these cell lines in various concentrations of EPO. For each mutant receptor, three independently isolated clonal lines were characterized, and the results from representative cell lines are shown in Fig. 2. The EPOR W282R mutant dominantly inhibited cellular proliferation at all concentrations of EPO tested, whereas the EPOR 1–321 mutant did not affect the dose-dependent proliferation of these cells in response to EPO (Fig. 2). Together, these results suggest that dimerization between WT and EPOR 1–321 receptors can stimulate the signaling pathways leading to cellular proliferation, whereas dimerization of WT and EPOR W282R is insufficient for mitogenic signaling. However, by this approach the precise molecular configuration of the cell surface receptor complexes could not be regulated definitively. Therefore, we sought to explore these findings further in a system in which the cell surface receptor configuration could be defined specifically. We replaced the extracellular domain of the EPOR with the extracellular domains of IL-2Rβ and γc because it has been demonstrated definitively that IL-2-induced heterodimerization of these two chains is necessary and sufficient to initiate signal transduction (36Goldsmith M.A. Lai S.Y.

The isoforms of NOS are grouped into three categories, neuronal NOS (nNOS), endothelial NOS (eNOS), and inducible NOS (iNOS). The first two constitutive isoforms are collectively referred to as cNOS. nNOS is a homodimer, which contains one molecule each of heme, FAD, FMN, and tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) per subunit (1Marletta M.A. J.

The binding sites for NADPH, FAD, and FMN are located in the carboxyl-terminal half of nNOS, which exhibits sequence homology to NADPH-cytochrome P-450 reductase and also contains FMN and FAD (6Bredt D.S.

Electron transfer from NADPH via the flavins is facilitated by the binding of Ca2+-calmodulin (Ca2+/CaM) andl-arginine (8Abu-Soud H.M. Stuehr D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A primary area of interest regarding the NOSs is the control of their activities. cNOS requires Ca2+/CaM and is therefore sensitive to levels of Ca2+ in the cell. On the other hand, iNOS contains tightly bound Ca2+/CaM and is not sensitive to cellular levels of Ca2+. cNOSs contain what appears to be an autoinhibitory element, whereas iNOS does not (12Salerno J.C.

These investigators found that arginine stabilized the complex. Abu-Soud et al. (20Abu-Soud H.M. Wang J. Rousseau D.L. Fukuto J. Ignarro L.J. Stuehr D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22997-23006Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar) showed that the nitrosyl complex was formed rapidly and experienced a relatively slow O2-dependent turnover in which nitrate was a product. In the steady state, most of the enzyme appeared to be complexed in this fashion, dissociating upon the depletion of either NADPH or l-arginine. An estimated K m for oxygen (KmO2) of 38 μmwas determined for NADPH oxidation in the absence ofl-arginine. In the presence of l-arginine, a value of KmO2 of about 350 μm was reported (21Abu-Soud H.M.

It has been suggested that the formation of nitrosyl NOS and its slow recycling to free NOS enable the enzyme to synthesize NO⋅ over a broad range of O2 concentrations. Confirmation of hexacoordinated NO⋅ with the heme prosthetic group of nNOS by EPR spectroscopy was reported by Migita et al. (22Migita C.T. Salerno J.C. Masters B.S.S. Martásek P. McMillan K. Ikeda-Saito M. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10987-10992Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), who also showed that l-arginine is bound near the distal side of the heme prosthetic group in close proximity to the bound NO⋅. The NO⋅-heme complex was stabilized byl-arginine and analogs of l-arginine. Recently, Abu-Soud et al. (23Abu-Soud H.M. Wu C. Ghosh D.K. Stuehr D.J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 3777-3786Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) have reported the results of studies in which the rates of formation and decomposition of the nitrosyl iNOS oxygenase domain dimer were measured. However, no conclusions were drawn regarding the extent of autoinhibition of the full-length isoform by NO⋅. Previously, we had shown that 3–4 m urea simulated the stimulatory effect of Ca2+/CaM on NADPH-cytochromec reductase activity of nNOS (24Narayanasami R. Nishimura J.S. McMillan K. Roman L.J. Shea T.M. Robida A.M. Horowitz P.M. Masters B.S.S. Nitric Oxide Biol. Chem. 1997; 1: 39-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Guanidinium chloride (GmCl), which like urea is a protein denaturant, at 0.4–0.5m, stimulated the reductase activity to essentially the same extent. It was, therefore, of interest to determine whether other reagents of lesser protein denaturing capability would elicit similar changes in reductase activity and whether any of these reagents could promote NO⋅ synthesis in the absence of Ca2+/CaM. In this work, we have found that neither urea nor GmCl is capable of mimicking the stimulatory effect of Ca2+/CaM on NO⋅synthesis by nNOS and that both reagents are actually inhibitory to the reaction when added in the presence of Ca2+/CaM. However, we have found that a variety of salts stimulated both the NADPH-cytochrome c reductase and Ca2+/CaM-dependent NO⋅ synthase activities of nNOS. Their efficacy in stimulating these activities could be correlated with the ability of these salts to induce structural changes in collagen and cold gelatin in dilute solution and unfolding or destabilization of native ribonuclease. The background of these investigations has been reviewed (25von Hippel P.H. Wong K.-Y. Science. 1964; 145: 577-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). Concentrations of salts required to stimulate reductase activity were somewhat higher than those required for optimal stimulation of NO⋅ synthesis. Using the hemoglobin capture assay of the NO⋅-producing activity of NOS, it was found that sodium perchlorate (NaClO4), at 50 mm, brought about a 5-fold increase in NO⋅ synthesis at 100 μml-arginine, the assay concentration of this substrate. At very low arginine concentrations (below 1 μm), NaClO4 had no effect. However, at higher arginine concentrations, reversal of the substrate inhibition by NaClO4 was apparent. Use of the NOS assay in which conversion of arginine to citrulline is measured revealed that oxyhemoglobin (oxyHb) or superoxide anion (generated by the oxidation of xanthine in the presence of xanthine oxidase) was required to obtain optimal stimulation with NaClO4. Comparable results were obtained when sodium chloride (NaCl) was used in place of NaClO4. Spectrophotometric observation of the nitrosyl nNOS complex, which is characterized by an absorption maximum at 436 nm, revealed that its formation was completely inhibited by the addition of 50 mm NaClO4 and a superoxide-generating system. Thus, it would appear that NaClO4, as well as other salts, prevent the formation of, or destabilize, the nitrosyl derivative in conjunction with reagents that react with NO⋅. CD measurements of nNOS·Ca2+/CaM indicated that only small changes in the secondary structure of the enzyme occurred in the presence of 25–75 mm NaClO4. GmCl was obtained from Whitaker Corp. (Delaware Water Gap, PA). Guanidinium thiocyanate was a product of Eastman Kodak. NaClO4 was purchased from Aldrich. Horse heart cytochromec (type VI), HEPES, BisTris, NADPH, sodium nitrate, and bovine brain CaM were obtained from Sigma. BH4 was a product of Research Biochemicals International (Natick, MA). Other compounds were of reagent grade and were purchased from reputable commercial sources. nNOS was overexpressed in Escherichia coli and purified according to Roman et al. (26Roman L.J. Sheta E.A.

Highly purified Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase (3,400 units/mg) was a generous gift from Dr. John Crow (University of Alabama at Birmingham). Catalase (25,000 units/mg) and buttermilk xanthine oxidase (1.1 unit/mg) were purchased from Sigma. Superoxide dismutase and xanthine oxidase were assayed as described by McCord and Fridovich (27McCord J.M. Fridovich I. J. Biol.

Nitric oxide formation was measured by the hemoglobin capture assay at 25 °C following the procedures of Kelm et al. (29Kelm M. Feelisch M. Spahr R. Piper H.M. Noack E.A. Schrader J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1988; 154: 236-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar) and Stuehret al. (30Stuehr D.J. Kwon N.S. Nathan C.F. Griffith O.W. Feldman P.L. Wiseman J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 6259-6263Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Measurements were made in a Shimadzu UV-2101 PC (dual beam) scanning spectrophotometer. Assay samples were read against blanks containing all assay components except nNOS.l-Citrulline formation from l-arginine was measured after separation of the amino acids using cation exchange chromatography by the method of Bredt and Snyder (31Bredt D.S. Snyder S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 682-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (3128) Google Scholar), except that 5 μm BH4 was added to the assay solution, and 0.5 μCi/ml l-[14C]arginine was used in place of l-[3H]arginine. Dilutions of nNOS were made with 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) containing 0.1 mm sodium EDTA, 100 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm2-mercaptoethanol, and 10% glycerol. Salts were usually prepared as 2m solutions in 50 mm HEPES/KOH (pH 7.6). When necessary, the pH was adjusted with small volumes of 6 nHCl or 10 n NaOH. To understand better the effects of urea and GmCl on the NADPH-cytochrome c reductase activity of nNOS, the effects of other protein denaturants and nondenaturants were examined. The results are shown in Fig. 1. As with urea and GmCl (24Narayanasami R. Nishimura J.S. McMillan K. Roman L.J. Shea T.M. Robida A.M. Horowitz P.M. Masters B.S.S. Nitric Oxide Biol. Chem. 1997; 1: 39-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), in most of the cases there was a concentration dependence of activity, attaining an optimal level followed by a decline. As expected (Fig. 1 A), GmSCN was the most effective on a molar basis, undoubtedly because of the destabilizing effects of both guanidinium and thiocyanate ions (25von Hippel P.H. Wong K.-Y. Science. 1964; 145: 577-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). It is notable that the stimulation at optimal GmSCN was equal to that of Ca2+/CaM. As reported earlier (24Narayanasami R. Nishimura J.S. McMillan K. Roman L.J. Shea T.M. Robida A.M. Horowitz P.M. Masters B.S.S. Nitric Oxide Biol. Chem. 1997; 1: 39-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), GmCl stimulation of NADPH-cytochromec reductase activity at 0.4–0.5 m equaled that of Ca2+/CaM. The remaining anions described in the figure were added as their sodium salts. In Fig. 1 A, the order of effectiveness of the anions, as indicated by lower concentrations required to reach optimal activity, was SCN−, ClO4−, NO3−, and 1/2 SO42− = CH3COO−. Although the magnitudes of the stimulations by the halides were significantly lower than those of many of the other anions (Fig. 1 B), there was a clear order of effectiveness: I−, Br−, Cl− and F−. Taking these data together, the order of molar effectiveness of the anions in stimulating NADPH-cytochromec reductase activity of nNOS was SCN− = I− > ClO4− > Br− > NO3− > Cl− > SO42− = F− = CH3COO−. This order is in general agreement with the efficacy of these compounds as denaturants of other proteins (25von Hippel P.H. Wong K.-Y. Science. 1964; 145: 577-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). Thus, for native collagen and ribonuclease, the order observed for these anions was SCN− > I− > ClO4− > NO3− > Br− > Cl− > CH3COO− > SO42−. Monovalent cations, added as their chloride salts, gave less definitive stimulations than the anions tested, as shown in Fig.2. For the most part, optimal stimulations required concentrations close to 1 m. NH4+ was the most stimulatory, an unexpected observation in view of its reported effect as a protein-stabilizing cation (25von Hippel P.H. Wong K.-Y. Science. 1964; 145: 577-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). Over a broad range of concentrations, Cs+, Na+, K+, and Rb+, in that order, gave stimulations of 5–3-fold, whereas Li+, at the same concentrations, was only weakly stimulatory. It is of interest that Li+ was more effective than the other four alkali metal cations in stabilizing collagen (25von Hippel P.H. Wong K.-Y. Science. 1964; 145: 577-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). In an overall sense, these results probably indicate that various salts exert their stimulatory effect by influencing the conformation of nNOS and that mere changes in ionic strength cannot explain the striking differences in the data. Because it was clear that many salts were able to mimic the stimulating effect of Ca2+/CaM on nNOS-catalyzed NADPH-cytochromec reductase, it was important to determine whether the presence of these reagents could affect NO⋅ synthesis by nNOS in the absence of Ca2+/CaM. When urea was tested in the hemoglobin capture assay or in the citrulline assay, it was found not to substitute for Ca2+/CaM. In fact, in the presence of Ca2+/CaM, 2 m urea completely inhibited the enzyme, as measured by both the hemoglobin capture and citrulline assay methods. Likewise, in the hemoglobin capture assay, GmCl failed to stimulate NO⋅ synthesis in the absence of Ca2+/CaM, and, at 0.1–0.2 m, it completely inhibited the reaction in the presence of Ca2+/CaM. This was not surprising because guanidinium ion would be expected to antagonize the binding ofl-arginine to the enzyme. Sorrentino et al. (32Sorrentino R. Sautebin L. Pinto A. Life Sci. 1997; 61: 1283-1291Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) have shown that GmCl and other guanidinium compounds are inhibitory to both cNOS and iNOS. In the present study, other compounds, including NaClO4, NaNO3, and NaCl, failed to substitute for Ca2+/CaM in NO⋅ synthesis. In the course of using the hemoglobin capture method in the assay of NO⋅ synthesis by nNOS, it was found that several of the compounds used in the study of the NADPH-cytochrome creductase activity of nNOS actually stimulated Ca2+/CaM-dependent NO⋅ synthesis. In this study, GmSCN was not used because of its inhibitory effect on the hemoglobin capture assay of NO⋅ synthesis. NaSCN, as well as GmSCN, brought about a rapid and nonenzymatic change in the absorption spectrum of oxyHb in the presence of assay solution components, 2J. S. Nishimura and B. S. S. Masters, unpublished observation. which precluded their use in the assay. However, the order of effectiveness in the stimulation of NO⋅ synthesis by nNOS was ClO4− > I− = Br− > NO3− > CH3COO− = Cl− (Fig.3). With the exception of the positioning of I− and Br−, the order of efficacy, as anticipated from the protein-stabilizing and -destabilizing properties of this group of anions, was essentially maintained (see above discussion of Fig. 1). The data show that ClO4− brought about a 5-fold stimulation of the reaction at a concentration of 50 mm. The effects of I− and Br− were practically superimposable, whereas the effect of NO3− was distinguishable from that of either acetate ion or Cl−. F− was not tested because of its likely interaction at high concentrations with Ca2+. All of the alkali metal cations stimulated the hemoglobin capture assay without demonstrating differences in their effective concentrations, as shown in Fig. 4. In this respect, the results are similar to those obtained with these cations in the NADPH-cytochrome c reductase reaction (Fig. 2). Again, Li+ was the least stimulatory, which is consistent with its reported protein-stabilizing effects (25von Hippel P.H. Wong K.-Y. Science. 1964; 145: 577-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). All of the salts tested did not behave predictably. Thus, as shown in Fig. 5, Na2SO4produced significant stimulation of NO⋅ production over a broad concentration range (0.05–0.5 mSO42−), in stark contrast to its lack of effect on NADPH-cytochrome c reductase activity (Fig. 1). In addition, NH4Cl and (NH4)2SO4, both stabilizing salts (25von Hippel P.H. Wong K.-Y. Science. 1964; 145: 577-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar), were unexpectedly effective at relatively low ammonium ion concentrations (optimal at 0.1–0.2 m), although (NH4)2SO4 was significantly less stimulatory. In the NADPH-cytochrome c reductase assay, NH4+ was the most stimulatory cation tested (Fig. 2). It is possible that the stimulatory effect of NH4+/NH3 may represent a phenomenon unrelated to stabilization or destabilization of the enzyme protein. Two multivalent cations and other multivalent anions were also studied with regard to their stimulatory/inhibitory effects on NO⋅formation. Sodium phosphate (between 150 and 250 mm) stimulated NO⋅ formation some 3–4-fold. Sodium tartrate (between 100 and 200 mm) stimulated about 2.5-fold. Sodium citrate was stimulatory at low levels (2-fold at 25 mm) but inhibitory above 50 mm, probably because of its ability to chelate Ca2+. CaCl2 and MgCl2 were slightly stimulatory (10–30%) at low concentrations (<4 mm and < l mm, respectively) but inhibitory at higher concentrations. Further experiments were performed with NaClO4 because this reagent was effective at relatively low concentration (see Fig. 3) and did not interfere with either the hemoglobin capture assay or, as will be discussed shortly, the citrulline assay. K m values for l-arginine of 1.5 μm (31Bredt D.S. Snyder S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 682-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (3128) Google Scholar), 2.2 μm (33Schmidt H.H.H.W. Pollock J.S.

Gross S.S. Liu Q. Masters B.S.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8428-8432Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar) have been reported for nNOS. In the experiment described in Fig. 3, the l-arginine concentration was 100 μm. It was therefore of interest to examine the effect of NaClO4 over a broad range of l-arginine concentrations. For this purpose, the nNOS preparation was subjected to removal of residual l-arginine introduced during the purification procedure by the use of spin columns of Sephadex G-50 (34Penefsky H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 2891-2899Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The results of this study are described in Fig.6. Substrate inhibition of NO⋅synthesis by l-arginine is quite apparent in the data (Fig.6 A). The first evidence of inhibition appeared at about 5 μml-arginine. The addition of 50 mm NaClO4 substantially increased NOS activity over most of the concentration range studied. At 100 μm, the concentration of l-arginine used routinely in the assay, a stimulation of more than 5-fold was observed. Examination of the kinetics at low l-arginine concentrations (Fig.6 B) reveals stimulation by NaClO4 at concentrations in the 1–2 μml-arginine range. It was at concentrations below 1 μml-arginine that NO⋅ synthesis was not stimulated by NaClO4. It thus appears that NO⋅ synthesis by nNOS was extensively inhibited by its substrate l-arginine and that 50 mm NaClO4 almost completely reversed the inhibition. This impression is supported by the data in Fig.6 C, a double reciprocal plot of the data in Fig.6 A. In the presence or absence of NaClO4, the data can be extrapolated to give the same V maxand a K m value of approximately 5 μmfor l-arginine. However, substrate inhibition was obvious in the absence of NaClO4 but much less apparent in its presence. Further study of the effect of NaClO4 was pursued by use of the citrulline assay. This method involves incubation of nNOS in the presence of necessary cofactors with substratel-[14C]arginine and subsequent ion exchange chromatography to separate substrate and product (31Bredt D.S. Snyder S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 682-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (3128) Google Scholar). Up to 300 mm NaClO4 or NaCl in the incubation solution could be tolerated in the subsequent ion exchange chromatography on Dowex 50-Na+ columns. The concentrations of the components in the assay solution were the same as those described for the hemoglobin capture assay except that oxyHb was omitted and thel-arginine concentration was 20 μm instead of 100 μm as employed in the capture assay. As shown in Table I (Experiment 1), 50 mmNaClO4 alone had no effect on the reaction. However, the addition of oxyHb with NaClO4 stimulated the reaction some 3–4-fold. Using this assay method, Rogers and Ignarro (13Rogers N.E. Ignarro L.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 189: 242-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar) have shown that the addition of 30 μm oxyHb linearized the kinetics of cerebellar NOS beyond 5 min, ostensibly by trapping inhibitory NO⋅. It thus appeared likely that NaClO4 brought about release of inhibitory NO⋅ from the heme prosthetic group of nNOS and that the released NO⋅ was then scavenged by the heme group of oxyHb. In this process, NO⋅ is oxidized to nitrate (35Doyle M.P. Hoekstra J.W. J. Inorg. Biochem. 1981; 14: 351-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar), which is not inhibitory to NOS. Because NO⋅ is known to react with superoxide to produce peroxynitrite (36Beckman J.S. Beckman T.W. Chen J. Marshall P.A. Freeman B.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 1620-1624Crossref PubMed Scopus (6731) Google Scholar), xanthine/xanthine oxidase, which generates superoxide anion, was used in place of oxyHb. As shown in Table I (Experiment 3), this resulted in a near 3-fold stimulation in the presence of NaClO4. This effect was negated by superoxide dismutase in the presence of catalase. Qualitatively comparable data were obtained when superoxide anion generation by the autoxidation of BH4 (37Davis M.D. Kaufman S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 304: 9-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) at 100 μm (38Mayer B. Klatt P. Werner E.R. Schmidt K. J. Biol.

The interaction of nucleotides with GroEL was triggered by the photochemical release of the ligands from their corresponding biologically inactive precursors (caged nucleotides;P 3-1-(2-nitro)phenylethyl nucleotide). Binding of either ADP or ATP induced the appearance of small differential signals in the amide I band of the protein, sensitive to protein secondary structure, suggesting a subtle and localized change in protein conformation. Moreover, conformational changes associated with ATP hydrolysis were detected that differed markedly from those observed upon nucleotide binding. Both, high-amplitude absorbance changes and difference bands attributable to modifications in the interaction between oppositely charged residues were observed during ATP hydrolysis. Once this process had occurred, the protein relaxed to an ADP-like conformation. Our results suggest that the secondary structure as well as salt bridges of GroEL are modified during ATP hydrolysis, as compared with the ATP and ADP bound protein states.

Horwich A.L. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 743-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar, 2Richardson A. Landry S.J. Georgopoulos C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 138-143Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). GroEL consists of two heptameric rings composed of identical subunits that form a double toroid structure. Each subunit is organized into two major domains, the apical domain being involved in GroES and substrate binding, and the equatorial one holding the nucleotide-binding site and most of the intra- and inter-ring contacts, both linked by a small and flexible intermediate domain (3Braig K. Otwinowski Z. Hedge R. Boisvert D.C. Joachimiak A. Horwich A.L. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1994; 371: 578-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (1194) Google Scholar). Numerous ligands have been shown to modulate the conformation of GroEL (4Gibbons D.L. Horowitz P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 238-243Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 5Llorca S. Marco S. Carrascosa J.L. Valpuesta J.M. J. Struct. Biol. 1997; 118: 31-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Among them, nucleotides can modify the chemical properties, structure and substrate-binding affinity of the central cavity of the protein that binds the substrate (1Fenton W.A. Horwich A.L. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 743-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar, 6Xu Z. Horwich A.L. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1997; 388: 741-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (1042) Google Scholar). These modifications depend on the nature of the bound nucleotide. The cooperative binding of ATP switches GroEL from a high affinity state for non-folded proteins (T) to a protein release state (R) which has low affinity for substrate proteins (7Yifrach O. Horovitz A. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 255: 356-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). ATP hydrolysis drives the oligomer cavity through alternating states with different affinities for unfolded protein, and it has been recently demonstrated that nucleotide hydrolysis is required to release GroES, once ATP binds to the adjacent protein ring (8Rye H.S.

Electron microscopy (EM)1 studies have shown that ATP induces large conformational changes in GroEL (5Llorca S. Marco S. Carrascosa J.L. Valpuesta J.M. J. Struct. Biol. 1997; 118: 31-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 9Roseman A.M. Chen S. White H. Braig K. Saibil H.R. Cell. 1996; 87: 241-251Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). Supporting these findings, proteolysis studies have revealed a conformational change in the apical GroEL domain in response to nucleotide binding (4Gibbons D.L. Horowitz P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 238-243Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar,10Mendoza J.A. Del Campo G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16344-16349Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Moreover, ATP hydrolysis has also been correlated with an increased exposure of hydrophobic patches at the chaperonin surface (11Gorovits B.M. Ybarra Y. Horovitz P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6842-6845Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Although the importance of the molecular events associated to the nucleotide-induced allosteric transition of GroEL has been widely recognized, they remain as yet mostly unknown (12Horovitz A. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1998; 8: 93-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In an effort to obtain such information, we have applied time-resolved infrared difference spectroscopy combined with the use of caged nucleotides. This approach allows to monitor subtle changes in the vibrational spectrum between two protein states whose interconversion can be triggered in the infrared cuvette. Moreover, time-resolved IR spectroscopy makes it possible to follow in real-time the formation of intermediates in the ATPase reaction cycle of GroEL, with the following advantages. (i) It is a non-invasive technique, i.e. there is no need to label the protein, and therefore the possible alteration of the protein structure by the label is avoided. (ii) It allows to follow, at the same time, the kinetic parameters of overall protein conformational changes, and modifications of specific protein groups as a consequence of nucleotide binding and hydrolysis (13Barth A. Kreutz W. Mäntele W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1194: 75-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 14Barth A. von Germar F. Kreutz W. Mäntele W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30637-30646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Our results demonstrate that GroEL undergoes a transient conformational transition during ATP hydrolysis, that differs from the one observed upon ATP or ADP binding. GroEL was overexpressed from E. coli and purified as described previously (15Llorca O. Marco S. Carrascosa J.L. Valpuesta J.M. FEBS Lett. 1994; 345: 181-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The protein was concentrated with microconcentration filters (Centricon-50 (Amicon)), and the buffer was exchanged by repeated concentration and dilution steps with buffer 100 mm imidazole, 100 mmNaCl, 30 mm MgCl2 prepared in H2O or D2O, pH or pD 7.0. Infrared samples were prepared by drying 1 μl of caged nucleotide (20 mm) and 1 μl of 40 mm KCl onto a CaF2 window with a trough of 8-μm depth and 8-mm diameter. For the samples containing DTT, an additional 1 μl of 20 mm DTT was dried onto the window. They were rehydrated with the same volume of GroEL dissolved in the above buffer and the samples were sealed with a second flat window and thermostated at 25 °C during the experiment. Protein subunit concentration was 0.8 mm, as determined by the bicinchoninic acid assay (Sigma). Control experiments were measured on identical samples, prepared without GroEL. Infrared measurements were carried out on a modified Bruker IFS 66 spectrophotometer equipped with a HgCdTe detector. Data were acquired with double sided interferograms in a forward-backward mode at a spectral resolution of 4 cm−1. One interferometer cycle corresponding to two spectra needed 65 ms for completion. After recording a blank difference spectrum to control for the signal-to-noise ratio and base-line stability, the experiment started by measuring a reference spectrum coadded from 300 scans which characterized the unperturbed sample. Photolysis of caged nucleotides was triggered with a Xenon flash tube with high UV output. The voltage of the flash power supply was adjusted to release approximately 1.5 mm nucleotide/flash. After the flash, 20 spectra at 2 scans each, 20 spectra at 4 scans each, 10 spectra at 10 scans each, 20 spectra at 20 scans each, and 20 spectra at 100 scans each were recorded. To additionally improve the signal-to-noise ratio, signals obtained from different samples were averaged after normalizing the solvent-subtracted reference spectra of the protein to the same absorbance value in the amide I (0.4 absorbance unit in D2O) or amide II (0.06 absorbance unit in H2O) bands. The difference spectra were not subjected to smoothing or other resolution enhancement procedures, such as deconvolution or derivation. The noise level in these spectra, as confirmed from control experiments, was estimated to be around 5 × 10−5 absorbance unit at frequencies above 1750 cm−1, where no signals appear, and approximately 10−4 absorbance unit at around 1650 in the H2O samples due to the strong absorbance from H-O-H bending modes. These noise levels confirmed the reliability of the experimentally observed weak signals. To fit the IR absorbance changes to a kinetic model, we used integrated band intensities. Integration was performed with respect to a baseline that was drawn between two limits at each side of the band. To avoid the overlapping effect expected in a complex difference profile, in some cases the integration boundaries were chosen so that the resulting area was characteristic of a single band. To determine the rate constants, several bands with high signal-to-noise ratio were selected. For the kinetic analysis the time slots of spectra recording were represented by their average times. The ATPase activity of GroEL was assayed at 25 °C, using malachite green to measure the amount of inorganic phosphate released upon ATP hydrolysis as previously reported (16Baykov A.A. Evtushenko D.A. Avaeva S.M. Anal. Biochem. 1988; 171: 266-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (689) Google Scholar). The reaction was started by adding GroEL (final oligomer concentration 0.49 μm) to the assay solution containing 50 mmimidazole, 40 mm KCl, 30 mm Mg2Cl, 100 mm NaCl, pH 7.0, and 1.5 mm free or caged ATP. Aliquots of the reaction mixture were diluted with 3 volumes of 1m HClO4, and centrifuged (30 min, 14,000 × g). The supernatant was mixed with the malachite green reagent and allowed to stand for 2 h at room temperature for the color to develop. Control experiments were also performed to account for the spontaneous hydrolysis of the nucleotide, which was found to be negligible under our experimental conditions. 150 μm free and caged nucleotides in the above buffer were centrifuged in the presence of the same concentration of GroEL subunits, using microconcentration filters (Microcon-30 (Amicon)). The filtration membrane retained all protein material and bound nucleotide while allowed unbound nucleotide to pass through. Nucleotide concentration in the filtrate was estimated from the absorbance at 260 nm, using an extinction coefficient of 15,400 m−1 cm−1. Control experiments without nucleotide were carried out to subtract background contributions to this value. Samples containing GroEL and GroES (1:2 molar ratio) in 50 mm imidazole, 40 mm KCl, 30 mm Mg2Cl, 100 mm NaCl, pH 7.0, were incubated with 3 mm caged nucleotides. After 30 min at 25 °C, they were negatively stained with 1% uranyl acetate on thin coated collodion grids previously glow discharged for 15 s. Transmission electron microscopy (JEOL 1200EX-II electron microscope operated at 120 KV) and image processing were performed as previously reported (5Llorca S. Marco S. Carrascosa J.L. Valpuesta J.M. J. Struct. Biol. 1997; 118: 31-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Prior to the spectroscopic characterization of the interaction of nucleotides with GroEL, it is necessary to ensure that their caged analogs are not bound or hydrolyzed by the protein. ATPase activity measurements clearly indicate that caged ATP is not modified by GroEL, and that hydrolysis only occurs after ATP release from the cage (Fig.1). Furthermore, they also demonstrate that the presence of the free cage does not significantly affect the ATPase activity of the protein. However, they do not rule out the possible interaction between the caged ligands and the protein. In order to test whether binding of caged ADP and ATP to GroEL was taking place before nucleotide release from the cage, two types of experiments were performed. First, filtration experiments pointed out that, unlike free nucleotides which can bind tightly to half of the 14 available sites in GroEL (K d<15 μm; 17), none of the caged nucleotides were able to bind to the protein, since all the initially added caged ligands appeared in the filtrate (data not shown). Second, electron microscopy clearly showed that neither caged ATP nor caged ADP were able to induce the formation of GroES·GroEL asymmetric complexes, in contrast to the free nucleotides (5Llorca S. Marco S. Carrascosa J.L. Valpuesta J.M. J. Struct. Biol. 1997; 118: 31-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) (data not shown). Therefore, we conclude that caged nucleotides do not bind to GroEL. The interaction between ATP and GroEL is accomplished by triggering the release of the ligand from an inactive (caged) photolabile analog with a UV flash, which does not disturb the sample (18McCray J.A. Herbette L. Kihara T. Trentham D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 7237-7241Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). The spectrum recorded before illuminating the sample is the reference, and those measured after the flash are the samples. The difference spectra show absorbance changes that reflect conformational alterations of functionally important regions of the protein, while contributions from the rest of the molecule are canceled. Positive signals in the difference spectra refer to the nucleotide-bound GroEL conformation, whereas negative signals are characteristic of the free, unliganded protein. The difference IR spectrum recorded 3.6 s after release of ATP to the medium displays sharp differential features, indicating a nucleotide-induced conformational transition between distinct protein conformations (Fig. 2). These signals can essentially be attributed to molecular processes taking place during caged ATP photolysis, ATP binding and hydrolysis, and to protein conformational changes associated with its ATPase activity. The assignment of the experimental absorbance changes to any of these processes requires investigation of the photolysis of caged ATP in the absence of protein (Fig. 2, dashed lines). The bands at 1692 cm−1 (H2O), 1686 cm−1(D2O), and those appearing at 1526 cm−1 and below 1350 cm−1 in both media, contain contributions from the photolysis reaction. From previous studies, it is known that ATP hydrolysis gives rise to difference absorbance signals below 1300 cm−1 (19Barth A. Mäntele W. Kreutz W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1057: 115-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), thus leaving the 1800–1300 cm−1spectral region free from unwanted signals overlapping with the protein bands. Therefore, the absorbance changes that will be considered below, which are observed upon nucleotide release in the presence of GroEL, can be assigned to protein conformational changes induced by ATP binding and its subsequent hydrolysis. The strongest difference bands in H2O are two positive signals at 1654 and 1572 cm−1. Less intense differential bands appear at 1692(+)/1673(−), 1641(−)/1629(+), 1556(+)/1546(−), and 1511(+)/1508(−) cm−1. The effect of deuteration helps to distinguish bands caused by amide modes of the polypeptide backbone from bands due to amino acid side chains. The amide I modes (1700–1610 cm−1; mainly due to peptide C=O groups) shift up to 10 cm−1, while the amide II band (mainly due to amide-backbone NH groups) shifts from 1550 cm−1 to 1460 cm−1 (20Byler D.M. Susi H. Biopolymers. 1986; 25: 469-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (2720) Google Scholar, 21Arrondo J.L.R. Muga A. Castresana J. Goñi F.M. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1993; 59: 23-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (771) Google Scholar, 22Jackson M. Mantsch H.H. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1995; 30: 95-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (1644) Google Scholar). In contrast, amino acid side chains absorbing in this spectral region, i.e. those from Asn, Gln, Lys, Arg, show larger shifts (23Venyaminov S.Y. Kalnin N.N. Biopolymers. 1990; 30: 1259-1271Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar, 24Chirgadze Y.N. Shestopalov B.V. Venyaminov S.Y. Biopolymers. 1975; 14: 679-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar). Deuteration of the sample induces the following noticeable changes in the difference spectrum of the protein. 1) The absorbance changes at 1692, 1654, and 1629 cm−1 are downshifted to 1686, 1648, and 1607 cm−1, respectively. 2) The intensity of the differential signal observed in H2O at 1556(+)/1546(−) is strongly reduced. 3) The signal at 1511(+)/1508(−) cm−1 almost completely disappears. The small shift observed for the 1692 and 1654 cm−1 bands suggests that they are due to changes in the amide I absorbance of the polypeptide backbone. The existence of an ATP-induced conformational change is also indicated by the 1556(+)/1546(−) differential feature, which can be assigned to the amide II mode of the protein, because it is virtually not detected upon deuteration. Instead, a band is observed at 1469 cm−1, which may represent the amide II′ mode. A possible interpretation of the 1568 cm−1 band is the appearance of carboxylate group(s) upon ATP binding and/or hydrolysis. Indeed, a band at this position has been assigned to -COO−groups of Glu or Asp residues and it has been shown to be influenced very little, as compared with other side chain vibrations, by deuteration (23Venyaminov S.Y. Kalnin N.N. Biopolymers. 1990; 30: 1259-1271Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar, 24Chirgadze Y.N. Shestopalov B.V. Venyaminov S.Y. Biopolymers. 1975; 14: 679-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar). This could be achieved by either a change in the ionization state of a Glu or Asp residue(s), or a modification of the interaction between oppositely charged residues, i.e. salt bridges. If the former hypothesis would hold, the appearance of this positive band should be accompanied by a negative counterpart at around 1700–1730 cm−1, that would indicate the disappearance of a -COOH group(s). Although a signal at this position is not observed in the difference IR spectra, we have carried out the same experiments in the presence of DTT to eliminate the photolysis signal that appears at 1692 cm−1 (H2O) and 1686 cm−1(D2O), that may partially overlap with a COOH vibration. The results (Fig. 2, insets) demonstrate the presence of a weak negative signal at 1700 cm−1 in H2O that is shifted upon deuteration to 1695 cm−1. The position of this differential feature, downshifted from the characteristic frequency of the -COOH groups, makes its assignment to a carboxylic group unlikely. It is important to note that the positions and amplitudes of all the differential signals mentioned above are maintained, indicating that the presence of DTT does not modify the structural transition brought about by the interaction of ATP with GroEL. Alternatively, if a modification of the interaction between oppositely charged residues were responsible for the 1568 cm−1positive signal, “marker” differential bands for Arg and/or Lys residues should also be observed in the infrared difference spectra. These bands appear in the 1700–1500 cm−1 spectral region, where they can overlap with vibrations from the amide I and amide II modes of the protein. Based on studies of model compounds (23Venyaminov S.Y. Kalnin N.N. Biopolymers. 1990; 30: 1259-1271Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar, 24Chirgadze Y.N. Shestopalov B.V. Venyaminov S.Y. Biopolymers. 1975; 14: 679-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar), the protonated side chain of arginine residues gives rise to two signals at around 1673 and 1633 cm−1 in H2O that shift to 1607 and 1586 cm−1 in D2O, while the NH3+ modes of Lys at around 1513 cm−1 disappear upon deuteration. Due to the possible overlap with protein backbone modes, the assignment of the differential features at around 1673 cm−1 to Arg residues is not straightforward. However, the putative assignment of the 1629 cm−1 signal to these residues is supported by the fact that it is virtually abolished upon deuteration. Furthermore, the absorbance change at 1607 cm−1 in D2O may be attributed to Arg side chains, and possible contributions from protein backbone signals are not likely. These results, together with the disappearance of the 1511(+)/1508(−) cm−1 feature upon deuteration, suggest that both Arg and Lys residues could experience a change in their chemical environments during the interaction of ATP with GroEL. The alternative assignment of the 1511(+)/1508(−) cm−1 spectral feature, observed only in H2O, to Tyr residues can be reasonably discarded because if this were the case neither the position nor the intensity of these vibrations should be significantly affected by deuteration (23Venyaminov S.Y. Kalnin N.N. Biopolymers. 1990; 30: 1259-1271Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar, 24Chirgadze Y.N. Shestopalov B.V. Venyaminov S.Y. Biopolymers. 1975; 14: 679-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar). To distinguish the possible different conformational states generated as a consequence of the interaction of ATP with GroEL, we have analyzed the time dependence of the absorbance changes in the infrared difference spectrum of the protein (Fig.3). Release of ATP from the cage occurs within the first 33 ms after the flash, as judged by the time course of the intensity of the photolysis bands (see the negative band at 1526 cm−1). The corresponding infrared difference spectrum shows a positive differential signal at 1648 cm−1, attributable to the protein, which is maintained in the spectra recorded during the first 0.23 s after the flash. At longer time intervals, up to 7 s, the intensity of this and other positive (1607 and 1568 cm−1) and negative (1673 and around 1620 cm−1) differential features increases. The amplitude of these absorbance changes is maintained during approximately 60 s, a time interval that most likely corresponds to a multiple turnover reaction where the enzyme is in the steady-state (note that the [ATP]/[GroEL subunit] is approximately 2). This interpretation would be in accordance with kinetic studies using pyrene-labeled GroEL (17Burston S.G. Ranson N.A. Clarke A.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 249: 138-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Afterward, a slow structural change drives GroEL into a conformation analogous to that exhibited in the presence of ADP (see below). As compared with the IR difference spectra obtained within the 10–60-s interval, the spectrum of this conformation lacks the 1568 cm−1 signal and shows a positive signal at 1627 cm−1, both characteristic of the ADP-bound state (see Fig.3, top trace, for a comparison). The analysis of the time course of the absorbance changes after ATP release is shown in Fig.4. The selected signals are tentatively assigned to alterations of the amide I mode of the polypeptide backbone (1648 cm−1), of acidic amino acid side chains (1568 cm−1), and of phosphate vibrations (1273 cm−1). To properly analyze the time course of these signals, two time constants were required. Their values for the fast phase are 0.4, 0.55, and 0.8 s for the 1273, 1648, and 1568 cm−1 bands, respectively, while those of the slow phase are 3.3 ± 0.3 s for all bands.Figure 4Kinetics of selected infrared absorbance changes of GroEL in the presence of ATP, measured in D2O buffer. Labels refer to the wave number of absorption in cm−1. Different constants were added to each kinetic trace to allow for a clear and simultaneous representation. ■, 1648 cm−1; ●, 1568 cm−1; ▴, 1273 cm−1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) A comparison of the difference spectra recorded 3.6 s after the photolysis flash, in the presence (solid lines) and absence (dashed lines) of GroEL, reveals that ADP binding to the protein induces the appearance of absorbance changes in the 1700–1610 cm−1 spectral region (amide I band) that cannot be attributed to the photolysis reaction (Fig.5). These absorbance changes are located at 1647 and 1628 cm−1 in both H2O and D2O. The possible contribution of amino acid side chains to these differential signals can be better considered by analyzing the effect of deuteration on the difference spectrum. As stated before, the absence of significant shifts in band position upon deuteration allows assignment of the observed major absorbance changes to peptide C=0 groups. It is important to note that none of these bands shows the kinetic behavior observed in the ATP-containing samples (data not shown), and that they reach their maximum amplitude 0.42 s after nucleotide release to the medium. More significantly, the ADP-induced difference spectra do not display absorbance changes attributable to basic and acidic amino acid side chains, as observed in the presence of ATP. There are a number of experimental evidences indicating that the conformational rearrangements induced in GroEL by the physiologically relevant nucleotides might have functional implications. EM studies have shown that the apical domains of GroEL move differently in the presence of ATP or ADP (5Llorca S. Marco S. Carrascosa J.L. Valpuesta J.M. J. Struct. Biol. 1997; 118: 31-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 9Roseman A.M. Chen S. White H. Braig K. Saibil H.R. Cell. 1996; 87: 241-251Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). Moreover, only in the presence of ATP and during its hydrolysis does GroEL seem to transiently expose additional hydrophobic residues as judged from bis-1-anilino-8-naphthalenesulfonate binding experiments (11Gorovits B.M. Ybarra Y. Horovitz P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6842-6845Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Functional studies with a disulfide GroEL mutant have also shown that nucleotide hydrolysis is coupled to a spatial rearrangement of the protein particle which, in turn, promotes release of the substrate (25Murai N. Makino Y. Yoshida M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28229-28234Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). So far, these experimental evidences have been analyzed in terms of changes in the tertiary and/or quaternary structures of the protein, paying little attention to its secondary structure. This is mainly due to limitations of the spectroscopic techniques to monitor local rather than overall conformational changes (26Mäntele W. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 197-202Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). In this context, “reaction-induced infrared difference spectroscopy” provides an appropriate tool to analyze the small and localized structural changes associated with binding to and/or hydrolysis of different nucleotides by GroEL. Before discussing the differences between the GroEL conformational states generated in the presence of ATP or ADP, we shall analyze the time dependence of the ATP-induced absorbance changes. This might help to distinguish the consequences of nucleotide binding from its subsequent hydrolysis on GroEL conformation. As shown by the intensity of the photolysis bands, nucleotide release to the medium occurs within the first 33 ms after the flash. Under the experimental conditions used in this work (high protein and nucleotide concentration, 25 °C) ATP binding to GroEL is strongly favored. This is supported by the fact that the ADP-induced absorbance changes reach their maximum amplitude 0.42 s after nucleotide release from the cage. Considering that the affinity of GroEL for both nucleotides is similar, it is reasonable to assume that the spectra recorded in the presence of ATP before this time would correspond to the ATP-bound GroEL state, without contributions from ATP hydrolysis. The corresponding difference spectra indicate that ATP binding to GroEL induces a small rearrangement of its secondary structure elements which, in contrast to what is found during nucleotide hydrolysis, does not affect basic and acidic amino acid side chains. Although the rate constant of the initial event compares well with the one described for ATP binding to pyrene-labeled GroEL (17Burston S.G. Ranson N.A. Clarke A.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 249: 138-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar,27Kad N.M. Ranson N.A. Cliff M.J. Clarke A.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 278: 267-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), it should be mentioned that under our experimental conditions overlapping of the binding and hydrolysis steps might obscure the kinetic analysis of the binding process. During the subsequent ATP hydrolysis step, the protein experiences a more pronounced conformational change, as evidenced by a 3-fold increase in the intensity of differential bands attributable to the polypeptide backbone. Moreover, our results also show the appearance of specific signals tentatively assigned to acidic and basic residues changing their chemical environment, indicating that ATP hydrolysis is probably coupled to modifications of salt bridges of the protein. The transient character of this conformational state is demonstrated by the recovery of the absorbance changes characteristic of the ADP-bound state after nucleotide hydrolysis. There are several salt bridges involved in intra- and intersubunits contacts within the same protein ring, as well as in inter-ring interactions. It has been shown that the intrasubunit salt bridge between Glu-409 and Arg-501, at the hinge between the equatorial and the apical domain and close to the ATP-binding site, becomes significantly weaker during the ATP-induced allosteric transitions of GroEL (28Aharoni A. Horovitz A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1698-1702Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The ion pair formed by Glu-434 and Lys-105, involved in intra-ring communication, is also believed to change in the presence of ATP, since the nucleotide greatly reduces the electron density at this contact site (9Roseman A.M. Chen S. White H. Braig K. Saibil H.R. Cell. 1996; 87: 241-251Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). Salt bridges also provide numerous contact sites between neighboring subunits. Based on EM and modeling studies, it has been proposed that during the ATP-induced transition from the T to the R state, several salt bridges between subunit apical domains are modified (29White H.E. Chen S. Roseman A.M. Yifrach D. Horovitz A. Saibil H.R. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 690-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). A conclusive assignment of the experimentally observed difference signals to specific amino acids will require the characterization of selected mutants. The time constant of the slow process is twice lower than the one estimated from ATPase activity and fluorescence measurements (17Burston S.G. Ranson N.A. Clarke A.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 249: 138-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar,30Jackson G.S. Staniforth R.A. Halsall D.J. Atkinson T. Holbrook J.J. Clarke A.R. Burston S.G. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 2554-2563Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). This discrepancy might well be caused by the higher protein and ATP concentrations used in this work, as it has been shown for the Ca2+-ATPase from sarcoplasmic reticulum (14Barth A. von Germar F. Kreutz W. Mäntele W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30637-30646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The difference between the ADP- and ATP-bound states of GroEL is difficult to ascertain, due to the small amplitude of the absorbance changes (≈1% of the amide I band intensity). This, nevertheless, suggests that the conformational change induced in GroEL upon nucleotide binding is localized, and it might reflect modifications within existing secondary structure elements rather than a net change of secondary structure (14Barth A. von Germar F. Kreutz W. Mäntele W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30637-30646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). However, the conformation of the active, ATP-hydrolyzing state of GroEL is clearly distinct from those of the nucleotide-bound states. The amplitude of the major absorbance changes within the amide I increases 3 and 4 times as compared with those observed upon ATP and ADP binding, respectively. The position of the strongest absorbance change in H2O (1654 cm−1) and D2O (1648 cm−1) has been described for solvent-exposed α-helical structures (31Muga A. Mantsch H.H. Surewicz W.K. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 2629-2635Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 32Surewicz W.K. Mantsch H.H. Chapman D. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 389-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (1415) Google Scholar). Less intense differential signals are characteristic of turns (1686, 1673 cm−1 in D2O) and β-structures (negative band, at approximately 1626 cm−1 in D2O). The fact that a differential signal attributable to the amide II mode of the protein also appears during ATP hydrolysis supports the existence of this transient GroEL conformation. The role of ATP hydrolysis in GroEL function still remains unclear. On one hand, kinetic and structural data indicate that ATP binding is responsible for the conformational changes in GroEL that release the bound substrate, while nucleotide hydrolysis simply resets the system. On the other hand, EM (5Llorca S. Marco S. Carrascosa J.L. Valpuesta J.M. J. Struct. Biol. 1997; 118: 31-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 9Roseman A.M. Chen S. White H. Braig K. Saibil H.R. Cell. 1996; 87: 241-251Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar) and biochemical data (11Gorovits B.M. Ybarra Y. Horovitz P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6842-6845Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) indicate that the ADP-bound state is structurally different from the unliganded and ATP-hydrolyzing state. Recent experiments have shown that ATP hydrolysis in the cis ring weakens the binding of GroEL and primes it for release, after ATP binding to the trans ring (8Rye H.S. Burston S.G. Fenton W.A. Beechem J.M. Xu Z. Sigler P.B. Horwich A.L. Nature. 1997; 388: 792-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). In this context, our results suggest that during ATP hydrolysis, GroEL undergoes a unique conformational transition, different from those caused by ATP or ADP-binding, which involves changes in solvent-exposed secondary structure elements and modifications of salt bridges of the protein. We thank Dr. F. M. Goñi for critically reading the manuscript."
https://openalex.org/W2076085343,"Abstract d-3-Phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase (PGDH) from Escherichia coli is allosterically inhibited by l-serine, the end product of its metabolic pathway. Previous results have shown that inhibition by serine has a large effect on V max and only a small or negligible effect on K m. PGDH is thus classified as a V-type allosteric enzyme. In this study, the active site of PGDH has been studied by site-directed mutagenesis to assess the role of certain residues in substrate binding and catalysis. These consist of a group of cationic residues (Arg-240, Arg-60, Arg-62, Lys-39, and Lys-141′) that potentially form an electrostatic environment for the binding of the negatively charged substrate, as well as the only tryptophan residue found in PGDH and which fits into a hydrophobic pocket immediately adjacent to the active site histidine residue. Interestingly, Trp-139′ and Lys-141′ are part of the polypeptide chain of the subunit that is adjacent to the active site. The results of mutating these residues show that Arg-240, Arg-60, Arg-62, and Lys-141′ play distinct roles in the binding of the substrate to the active site. Mutants of Trp-139′ show that this residue may play a role in stabilizing the catalytic center of the enzyme. Furthermore, these mutants appear to have a significant effect on the cooperativity of serine inhibition and suggest a possible role for Trp-139′ in the cooperative interactions between subunits."

The efficiency of bipartite CDK7-cyclin H in CDK2 phosphorylation is not affected by the addition of MAT1 (20Yankulov K.Y. Bentley D.L.

TFIIH lacking the CAK subcomplex completely recovers its transcriptional activity in the presence of free ternary CAK; MAT1 interacts with essential components of the DNA repair machineries XPB (ERCC3) and XPD (ERCC2), which are two helicase subunits of TFIIH that mediate the association of CAK with core TFIIH (10Reardon J.T.

However, these studies have provided little information about the cell cycle phase specificity and the corresponding regulatory mechanisms of MAT1 itself in the control of cell proliferation. It is known that the fundamental feature of vascular occlusive disease, including atherosclerosis, hypertension, restenosis, and transplant arteriopathy, is an accumulation of cells and extracellular matrixes in the intima, which consequently results in the narrowing of the vascular lumen. The vascular smooth muscle cell (SMC) represents the cell type most often implicated in the process of luminal narrowing (24Miano J.M. Vlasic N. Tota R.R. Stemerman M.B. Arterioscler.

In recent years, rapid progress has been made in identifying and understanding the functions of some cell cycle regulators in controlling SMC proliferation. Many important cell cycle factors, including the catalytic subunit CDC2 (32Morishita R. Gibbons G.H. Ellison K.E. Nakajima M. Zhang L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8474-8478Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar), the negative cell cycle regulator retinoblastoma protein (pRb) (29Smith R.C. Wills K.N. Antelman H. Truong L.N. Krasinski K.

S. A. 1996; 93: 7905-7910Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar), have shown to play important roles in regulating SMC proliferation, even though the molecular mechanisms still remain to be further studied. Considering that eukaryotic cell proliferation is a process that is highly regulated by the ordered assembly and determined substrate specificity of CDKs (35Nasmyth K. Science. 1996; 274: 1643-1645Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar, 36Elledge S.J. Science. 1996; 274: 1664-1672Crossref PubMed Scopus (1772) Google Scholar), the functions of MAT1 in assembling and determining substrate specificity of CAK (20Yankulov K.Y. Bentley D.L.

Biol. 1997; 17: 7220-7229Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar) may be directly involved in the regulation of a specific cell cycle phase. Given that MAT1 functions in the cell cycle as an assembly factor and a targeting subunit of CAK, we intended to determine the cell cycle phase specificity of MAT1 functions and the corresponding mechanism of the regulation of SMC proliferation. Our studies show that MAT1 is required for G1 exit. A loss of MAT1 arrests SMCs in G1phase and induces apoptosis to kill these arrested cells. An N-terminal 462-bp fragment of theMAT1 gene starting from the 5′-end, 40 bp upstream of the ATG initiation codon and extending to +422 bp of the coding region, was cloned into retroviral vector G1xSvNa (Genetic Therapy Inc./Novartis) in the antisense orientation (G1AsMatSvNa). G1AsMatSvNa indicates the order of the promoter and coding region of the constructs (G1, Moloney murine leukemia virus long terminal repeat sequences; AsMat, antisenseMAT1 RNA fragment; Sv, SV40 early enhancer and promoter; Na, neomycin phosphotransferase). The G1AsMatSvNa construct was confirmed by sequencing as described previously (37Wu L. Yee A. Liu L. Carbonaro-Hall D. Venatesan N. Tolo V.T. Hall F. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 2089-2096PubMed Google Scholar, 38Wu L. Liu L. Yee A. Carbonaro-Hall D. Tolo V. Hall F. Oncol. Rep. 1994; 1: 705-711PubMed Google Scholar) using primers complementary to the vector-flanking sequence upstream of theMAT1 antisense fragment and a Sequenase reaction kit (U. S. Biochemical Corp.). G1nBgSvNa bearing a nuclear targeting β-galactosidase was used for testing gene transfer efficiency. Retroviral supernatants were prepared as described (39Hwang J.J. Scuric Z. Anderson W.F. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 8138-8141Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, murine amphotropic PA317 packaging cells (American Type Culture Collection) were plated at 20% confluent density (5 × 105 cells) in 100-mm plates with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone Laboratories) and incubated at 37 °C for 16 h. Cells were transfected with 20 μg of DNA from G1xSvNa, G1AsMatSvNa, or G1nBgSvNa using calcium phosphate precipitation. 12 h after transfection, the cells were washed, and the medium was replaced. After an additional 48-h post-transfection period, cells were split 1:5 and selected with 0.6 mg/ml G418 (Life Technologies, Inc.) for 10 days. The colonies formed by G418-resistant cells were pooled as producer cells, and 4 × 106 cells/175-cm flask were plated for virus production. The supernatants containing amphotropic replication-defective retrovirus were collected after the cells reached 90% confluence and were clarified by centrifugation at 550 ×g for 10 min at 4 °C. For determining the viral titer, NIH 3T3 cells were plated at 2.5 × 104 cells/6-well plate and transduced with viral supernatants in the presence of 8 μg/ml Polybrene for 2 h. After a 48-h post-transduction incubation, the cells were selected with 0.6 mg/ml G418 for 10 days. The colonies formed by G418-resistant cells were stained with 0.1% methylene blue (Sigma). Rat aortic SMCs (A-10 cell line obtained from American Type Culture Collection) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 15% fetal bovine serum, 200 mml-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 and 95% air atmosphere. The G418 concentration for selection of stable clones was determined by a 7-day lethal dose test. SMCs were plated in 100-mm plates at a 20% confluent density for overnight attachment and transduced with either G1AsMatSvNa (MAT1-AS) or G1xSvNa (vector) at a multiplicity of infection of 10 in the presence of Polybrene (8 μg/ml) for 2 h. After a 48-h post-transduction incubation, the cells were selected for 7 days with 0.25 mg/ml G418. About 20 single stable clones were picked from antisenseMAT1-transduced SMCs and expanded for detection of theMAT1 expression phenotype. G418-resistant colonies from G1xSvNa (vector)-transduced SMCs were pooled as a control. Our working model was that G1AsMatSvNa (MAT1-AS)-transduced cells, theMAT1 expression of which has been inhibited, served as a testing sample, whereas G1xSvNa (vector)-transduced cells and additional nontransduced (blank) cells served as controls. The same dose of G418 used for selection was added to the medium for maintenance of stable clones. MAT1 expression in stable clones was tested before and after experiments by Western blotting. Western analysis was performed as described previously (3Yee A. Wu L. Liu L. Kobayashi R. Xiong Y. Hall F.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 471-477Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 40Wu L. Williams R. Carbonaro-Hall D. Liu L. Tolo V. Hall F.L. Int. J. Oncol. 1993; 3: 859-867PubMed Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Briefly, cells from G1AsMatSvNa (MAT1-AS)-transduced, G1xSvNa (vector)-transduced, and nontransduced (blank) cultures were grown to ≤80% confluence in 6-well plates. The cells in each well were lysed with 80 μl of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm EGTA, 25 mm sodium fluoride, 25 mm β-glycerol phosphate, pH 7.5, 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.2% (v/v) Triton X-100, and 0.5% (v/v) Nonidet P-40) on ice for 10 min. Cell lysate proteins were centrifuged at 14,000 ×g for 15 min at 4 °C. The same amount of protein was denatured in SDS sample buffer at 95 °C for 3 min, separated by electrophoresis on 16% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, and electrophoretically transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore Corp.) in Tris/glycine buffer containing methanol. The MAT1 protein was detected by polyclonal rabbit anti-human MAT1 antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and enhanced by chemiluminescence (Western-star, Tropix Inc.) using alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary goat anti-rabbit IgG (Sigma) as recommended by the manufacturer. A 40-kDa recombinant His-MAT1 protein expressed from the pET23b construct as described (37Wu L. Yee A. Liu L. Carbonaro-Hall D. Venatesan N. Tolo V.T. Hall F. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 2089-2096PubMed Google Scholar) was used as a positive control. The expression level of MAT1 was determined by scanning MAT1 content using a ScanJet IICX/T densitometer (Hewlett-Packard Co.). Cells from G1AsMatSvNa (MAT1-AS)-transduced, G1xSvNa (vector)-transduced, and nontransduced (blank) cultures were used for determining the ratio of cell duplication. The same number of cells were plated in 24-well plates. 24 h after plating, the cells were counted for 3 consecutive days before reaching confluence. To determine the number of living cells in culture, a cell proliferation assay kit (Promega) was used as recommended by the manufacturer. Briefly, the same number of cells were plated in 96-well plates and cultured for 72 h to ≤90% confluence. Cells were incubated with MTS tetrazolium compound (which is bioreduced to soluble formazan by dehydrogenase enzymes in metabolically active cells) for 1 h at 37 °C. The quantity of the formazan product as measured by the absorbance at 490 nm using a Kinetic Microplate Reader (Molecular Devices) is directly proportional to the number of living cells in culture. The activation of SMC proliferation from a nonproliferative to proliferative state in an “in vitro injured tissue” was determined as described (41Zhu N.L. Wu L. Liu P.X. Gordon E.M. Anderson W.F. Starnes V.A. Hall F.L. Circulation. 1997; 96: 628-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Cells were grown in 12-well plates to confluence (when they exhibited contact inhibition) and then scraped with a 200-μl pipette tip to create a 1-mm track devoid of cells in the central area of the wells. The “wound” tracks were immediately washed to remove the detached cells, and fresh medium was added. 24 h after the wound tracks were created, G1nBgSvNa retroviral constructs bearing a nuclear targeting β-galactosidase were added at a multiplicity of infection of 10 in the presence of Polybrene (8 μg/ml) for 2 h. 48 h post-transduction, gene transfer efficiency was measured by determining the percentage of β-galactosidase-positive cells upon exposure to 1 ml of staining solution (5 mm potassium ferricyanide, 5 mm potassium ferrocyanide, 2 mmMgCl2, and 400 μg/ml X-gal (GBT Inc.)). The number of blue cells, which reflected the activation of SMC proliferation and the time for closing the wound track, was assessed under a phase-contrast microscope either at ×40 or ×100 magnification. Cell cycle status and cell cycle phase specificity of apoptosis were determined by simultaneously measuring DNA content and DNA breaks as described (42Gorczyca W. Gong J. Ardelt B. Traganos F. Darzynkiewicz Z. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 3186-3192PubMed Google Scholar). An APO-DIRECT detection kit (Pharmingen), which works by “tail labeling” dUTP to 3′-OH termini of the DNA breaks by exogenous terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase and counterstaining integral DNA by propidium iodide, was used following the manufacturer's instructions with some modifications. Briefly, ∼1.5 × 106 cells (≤80% confluent) each from G1AsMatSvNa (MAT1-AS)-transduced, G1xSvNa (vector)-transduced, and nontransduced (blank) cultures were collected; centrifuged at 300 × g for 5 min; washed twice with ice-cold PBS; fixed in 1% paraformaldehyde on ice for 30 min; washed twice again; and post-fixed in 70% ethanol for ≥4 h at −20 °C. The pellet was collected by centrifugation at 1000 × gfor 10 min, washed twice with 2 ml of PBS, resuspended in 50 μl of FITC-dUTP staining solution, and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. The negative control for the blank was incubated with reaction buffer lacking terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase. Labeled cells were washed twice with PBS and stained with 1 ml of the propidium iodide/RNase solution for 30 min at 37 °C. Flow cytometric analysis was performed on a FACScalibur flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson). The cell cycle status was analyzed using ModFit LT software, and a dual parameter display for FITC-dUTP labeling was created with CellQuest Version 3.1 software (BDIS, San Jose, CA). Apoptotic morphologic changes of cells from G1AsMatSvNa (MAT1-AS)-transduced, G1xSvNa (vector)-transduced, and nontransduced (blank) SMC cultures were determined with or without propidium iodide staining. For propidium iodide staining of nuclei, cells were grown on 8-well plastic chamber slides for 72 h to ≤80% confluence, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min at room temperature, permeabilized in 0.1% Triton X-100 and 0.1% sodium citrate on ice for 2 min; stained with 0.015% propidium iodide (Sigma) at room temperature for 30 min; and examined under epifluorescence illumination at ×400 magnification. The morphologic apoptotic changes of cells without propidium iodide staining were monitored under a phase-contrast microscope at ×100 magnification. In situ DNA fragmentation was detected using a TUNEL reaction kit (Boehringer Mannheim) following the manufacturer's instructions with some modifications. In brief, cells from G1AsMatSvNa (MAT1-AS)-transduced, G1xSvNa (vector)-transduced, and nontransduced (blank) cultures were grown to ≤80% confluence on 8-well chamber slides, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde solution for 30 min at room temperature, permeabilized in 0.1% Triton X-100 and 0.1% sodium citrate for 2 min on ice, washed twice with PBS, and incubated with 50 μl of TUNEL reaction mixture in a humidified chamber for 1 h at 37 °C. Negative controls for blank, vector, andMAT1-AS cells were incubated with reaction buffer lacking terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase. The slides were washed three time with PBS and stained with 0.015% propidium iodide for 30 min at room temperature. After a final wash with PBS, the slides were air-dried and mounted under glass coverslips with aqueous medium. The apoptotic cells in each field were examined with a Zeiss epifluorescence microscope (Axioplan/MC100) at ×400 magnification using three different filters for co-locating apoptotic nuclei: rhodamine filter (red-stained total DNA), FITC-rhodamine dual filter (yellow green-stained DNA breaks and red-stained integral DNA), and FITC filter (green-stained DNA breaks). Photomicrographs were obtained using Kodak Ektachrome Tungsten 160T film. Low molecular weight DNA of the soluble cytoplasmic fraction was isolated as described (43Yasuda T. Grinspan J. Stern J.

RNA in the supernatant was degraded by incubation with DNase-free RNase (50 μg/ml) at 37 °C for 1 h, followed by proteinase K digestion. DNA was precipitated with 0.1 volume of 3 m sodium acetate, pH 5.2, 20 μg/ml glycogen, and 2 volumes of anhydrous ethanol at −20 °C for 20 min. The same amount of DNA (10 μg) was electrophoresed through agarose gel, stained with ethidium bromide, and visualized under UV light. A 100-bp DNA ladder was used as a molecular size marker. To examine whether retrovirus-mediated gene transfer of antisenseMAT1 RNA inhibits endogenous MAT1 expression, the cellular MAT1 content from G1AsMatSvNa (MAT1-AS)-transduced, G1xSvNa (vector)-transduced, and nontransduced (blank) cultures was determined by Western blotting. The results show that the MAT1 content was reduced ∼70% in MAT1-AS-transduced cells (Fig. 1 A). To ensure that the phenotype of MAT1 expression was consistently maintained during the experimental period, MAT1 content was examined again 5 months later, after finishing all of the testing (Fig.1 B). The data confirmed that >50% decreasedMAT1 expression in MAT1-AS cells was maintained during the experimental period. To examine whether the abrogation of MAT1 affects SMC proliferation, we used three different approaches. First, we sought to test whether abrogation of MAT1 inhibits cell duplication. This was accomplished by monitoring cell numbers over a 3-day culture period. The same number of cells from G1AsMatSvNa (MAT1-AS)-transduced, G1xSvNa (vector)-transduced, and nontransduced (blank) cultures were plated at t = 0 h and counted at 24, 48, and 72 h. The cell number from all groups declined ∼20% at 24 h because of natural attachment of the cells. The data show that cell duplication was at least 50% inhibited in the MAT1-AS culture compared with the blank and vector controls (Fig. 2 A). Our second approach was to determine the proliferating cell ratio in culture. The same number of cells from G1AsMatSvNa (MAT1-AS)-transduced, G1xSvNa (vector)-transduced, and nontransduced (blank) cultures were plated and grown for 72 h for proliferation assay. The results show that the number of living cells, represented by the amount of bioreduced formazan, was reduced ∼50% in the MAT1-AS culture compared with the blank and vector controls (Fig. 2 B). Arterial SMCs in vivo are normally maintained in a nonproliferative state within the tunica media. Upon arterial injury, activated SMCs migrate into the intimal layer of the arterial wall, where they proliferate and produce extracellular matrix components, which leads to neointima formation and causes angioplasty failure (25Raines E.W. Ross R. Br. Heart J. 1993; 69: S30-S37Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar, 28Gibbons G.H. Dzau V.J.

In the present study, immunohistochemical staining revealed that LRP-2 is also expressed by epithelial cells lining the ductal region and the ampulla of the rat seminal vesicle. To identify LRP-2 ligands in the seminal vesicle, we probed seminal vesicle fluid with 125I-labeled LRP-2 in a gel-blot overlay assay. A 100-kDa protein (under non-reducing conditions) was found to bind the radiolabeled receptor. The protein was isolated and subjected to protease digestion, and the proteolytic fragments were subjected to mass spectroscopic sequence analysis. As a result, the 100-kDa protein was identified as the seminal vesicle secretory protein II (SVS-II), a major constituent of the seminal coagulum. Using purified preparations of SVS-II and LRP-2, solid-phase binding assays were used to show that the SVS-II bound to the receptor with high affinity (K d = 5.6 nm). The binding of SVS-II to LRP-2 was inhibited using a known antagonist of LRP-2 function, the 39-kDa receptor-associated protein RAP. Using a series of recombinant subfragments of SVS-II, the LRP-2 binding site was mapped to a stretch of repeated 13-residue modules located in the central portion of the SVS-II polypeptide. To evaluate the ability of LRP-2 to mediate 125I-SVS-II endocytosis and lysosomal degradation, ligand clearance assays were performed using differentiated mouse F9 cells, which express high levels of LRP-2. Radiolabeled SVS-II was internalized and degraded by the cells, and both processes were inhibited by antibodies to LRP-2 or by RAP. The results indicate that LRP-2 binds SVS-II and can mediate its endocytosis leading to lysosomal degradation.

The function of LRP-2 in the reproductive tracts is not yet known, but an endocytic function can be inferred from its apical surface localization and presence within endocytic compartments including coated pits, endocytic vesicles, and early endosomes of efferent duct cells and principal cells of the epididymis (2Morales C.R. Igdoura S.A. Wosu U.A. Boman J. Argraves W.S. Biol. Reprod. 1996; 55: 676-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). During transit through the epididymis, spermatozoa undergo a maturational process that includes morphological and physiological changes (e.g. acquisition of sperm motility and alterations in the properties of the plasma membrane). A widely held view is that the secretory and absorptive activity of the epithelial cells lining the efferent ducts, epididymis, and accessory glands (e.g.seminal vesicles) profoundly influences sperm maturation (5Setty B.S. Endokrinologie. 1979; 74: 100-117PubMed Google Scholar, 6Brooks D.E. Aust. J. Biol. Sci. 1983; 36: 205-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 7Balasubramanian K. Sivashanmugam P. Thameemdheen S. Govindarajulu P. Indian J. Exp. Biol. 1991; ##: 907-909PubMed Google Scholar). Given the prominent expression of LRP-2 by efferent duct and epididymal epithelial cells, it has been hypothesized that LRP-2-mediated catabolism of proteins present in the epididymal fluid and/or associated with spermatozoa surfaces may be a contributing factor to spermatozoa maturation (2Morales C.R. Igdoura S.A. Wosu U.A. Boman J. Argraves W.S. Biol. Reprod. 1996; 55: 676-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Indeed, many LRP-2 ligands are found in the epididymis, seminal vesicle, and seminal plasma such as apolipoprotein J/clusterin (2Morales C.R. Igdoura S.A. Wosu U.A. Boman J. Argraves W.S. Biol. Reprod. 1996; 55: 676-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), apolipoprotein B (8Huang L.S. Voyiaziakis E. Chen H.L. Rubin E.M. Gordon J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Hu Z.Y. Zhang G.Y. Zhang G.H. Mol. Hum. Reprod. 1996; 2: 99-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) and have been speculated to be involved in sperm maturation and fertilization. We report here that LRP-2 is also expressed by epithelial cells of the seminal vesicles. In the rat, the seminal vesicles are two coiled tubular glands connected by a short duct to an excretory tubule that is anatomically equivalent to the ampulla of humans and other primates and connected to the ejaculatory duct (11Roberts K.P. Robaire B. Pryor J.L. Trasler J.M. Handbook of Andrology. Lawrence, KS, 1995Google Scholar). The seminal vesicles produce proteins that become covalently cross-linked by a transglutaminase and form the fibrin-like seminal coagulum. In rodents, the seminal coagulum forms the copulatory plug, whereas in humans, seminal coagulum is degraded within the female reproductive tract by proteases of prostatic origin, such as prostate-specific antigen (PSA), a member of the kallikrein family of serine proteinases (12Oesterling J.E. J. Urol. 1991; 145: 907-923Crossref PubMed Scopus (1175) Google Scholar, 13Wang M.C. Valenzuela L.A. Murphy G.P. Chu T.M. Invest. Urol. 1979; 17: 159-163PubMed Google Scholar). The major components of the seminal coagulum belong to a multigene family (14Lundwall A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 235: 424-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 15Lundwall A. Lazure C. FEBS Lett. 1995; 374: 53-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) that includes proteins such as rat seminal vesicle secretory proteins II, IV, and V (SVS-II, IV, and V, respectively) (16Wagner C.L.

Chem. 1989; 264: 1894-1900Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the following study, we present evidence indicating that a major rodent seminal vesicle secretory protein and transglutaminase substrate, SVS-II, is a novel LRP-2 ligand. LRP-2 was purified from porcine kidney using RAP-Sepharose affinity chromatography as described previously (19Kounnas M.Z. Stefansson S. Loukinova E. Argraves K.M. Strickland D.K. Argraves W.S. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1994; 737: 114-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Human 39-kDa receptor-associated protein (RAP) was expressed as a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein in bacteria and was purified according to Williams et al. (20Williams S.E. Kounnas M.Z. Argraves K.M. Argraves W.S. Strickland D.K. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1994; 737: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). SVS-II was purified from rat seminal vesicle as described by Wagner and Kistler (16Wagner C.L. Kistler W.S. Biol. Reprod. 1987; 36: 501-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Subfragments of rat SVS-II corresponding to the N-terminal domain (from residues 25 to 107), 13-residue-repeat domain central domain (from residues 108 to 311), and C-terminal domain (from residues 312 to 414) were expressed in bacteria as fusion proteins with GST using the pGEX2T vector (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using primers described in Table I. Fusion proteins were purified by glutathionine-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) chromatography as described by the manufacturer. Fibulin-1 was purified from human placenta as described in Argraves et al. (21Argraves W.S. Tran H. Burgess W.H. Dickerson K. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 3155-3164Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). LRP-2 and SVS-II were labeled with [125I]iodine (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using Iodogen (Pierce Chemical Co., Rockford, IL) to specific activities of 7–8 and 2–10 μCi/μg, respectively (∼0.222 MBq/μg and ∼0.279 MBq/μg, respectively).Table IOligonucleotide primers used in the generation of SVS-II cDNAsPrimer no.Oligonucleotide sequenceaRestriction site sequences (SmaI andEcoRI) and residues added to maintain reading frame are underlined.PositionsbThe numbers indicated correspond to nucleotide residues within the rat SVS-II sequence (GenBank™ accession numberJ05443).1CCCGGGAGGTGGGACAAAAGGTCAC2376–23932GAATTCTTCTTGGGATTTCAATTGGGATAC2619–25963CCCGGGATCCCAAATAAAATCCTTTAGAC2627–23494GAATTCGAGGGATTTTTGTTGCCAAAGGAC3236–23135CCCGGGAAAAGGGTTTTCTCAACAAACTC3237–32566GAATTCTTATCCCTTAAGTTGAGCCTG3548–3528a Restriction site sequences (SmaI andEcoRI) and residues added to maintain reading frame are underlined.b The numbers indicated correspond to nucleotide residues within the rat SVS-II sequence (GenBank™ accession numberJ05443). Open table in a new tab LRP-2-Sepharose affinity chromatography was used to isolate anti-LRP-2 IgG from a polyclonal serum (rb6286) derived from a rabbit immunized with porcine kidney LRP-2 prepared as described previously (22Kounnas M.Z. Haudenschild C.C. Strickland D.K. Argraves W.S. In Vivo (Athens). 1994; 8: 343-351PubMed Google Scholar). The bound IgGs were eluted using both high and low pH buffers and dialyzed against TBS (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4). After dialysis, the IgG preparation was applied to a column of RAP-Sepharose (1.0 mg of protein/ml of resin) and the unbound IgG selected on protein G-Sepharose. Control IgG was purified from normal rabbit serum using protein G-Sepharose. Mouse monoclonal antibody 3C3 to human LRP-2 was prepared by fusing NS1 myeloma cells with spleen cells from Balb/c mice immunized with human LRP-2 purified from urine (23Kounnas M.Z. Chappell D.A. Strickland D.K. Argraves W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14176-14181Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Hybridomas were selected based on production of immunoglobulin G antibodies reactive with both human and rat LRP-2 by both enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and immunoblotting. Sexually inactive, male Sprague-Dawley rats (age 6–8 months) were killed by CO2 inhalation, and their seminal vesicles were removed. The fluid contents of the seminal vesicles were released immediately into an ice-cold solution of spermine and spermidine (Sigma) (each at 5 mm in water). The fluid-containing solution was centrifuged for 10 min at 10,000 × g, and the supernatant was recovered. Protein concentration in the clarified fluid was estimated using a commercial protein assay system (Bio-Rad). Mouse embryonic F9 teratocarcinoma cells (ATCC CCL 185) were obtained from American Type Culture Collection and grown on 176-cm 2LRP-2 is synonymous with glycoprotein 330 (gp330). plates (Corning, Corning, NY) coated with 0.1% gelatin (Sigma) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM, Life Technologies, Inc.) with 10% bovine calf serum (HyClone Laboratories, Logan, VT), penicillin, and streptomycin (Mediatech, Herndon, VA). To augment LRP-2 expression, the cells were treated with 0.1 μm RA (Calbiochem, San Diego, CA) and 0.2 μm Bt2cAMP (Sigma) for 6–7 days without a change of medium (24Stefansson S. Chappell D.A. Argraves K.M. Strickland D.K. Argraves W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19417-19421Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Isolated rat seminal vesicles were dissected into four parts along their proximal to distal axis. Each segment was placed in Bouin's fixative (EM, Diagnostic Systems, Gibbstown, NJ) for 4 h at room temperature and then placed in 70% ethanol for 18 h at 4 °C. The fixed tissue specimens were dehydrated, embedded in paraffin, and sectioned at 5 μmthickness. Immunohistochemical staining was carried out using a Sequenza coverplate system (Shandon Lipshaw, Pittsburgh, PA) with polyclonal LRP-2 IgG (rb6286) and normal rabbit IgG (each at 2 μg/ml). An Elite Vectastain ABC kit (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) and the chromogenic substrate DAB (Sigma) were used for antibody detection. Sections were counter-stained with hematoxylin (Shandon Lipshaw). Aliquots of rat seminal vesicle fluid, rat SVS-II, GST-SVS-II fusion proteins, GST, RAP, or fibulin-1 were electrophoresed with fibulin-1 and RAP on 4–12% polyacrylamide gels (Novex, San Diego, CA) in the presence of SDS and under non-reducing conditions. The separated proteins were electrophoretically transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher and Schuell), and unoccupied sites were blocked with 3% nonfat milk in TBS (pH 8.0) (blocking buffer). The membranes were incubated with 125I-LRP-2 (1 nm) in blocking buffer containing 5 mm CaCl2 and 0.05% Tween 20. To block the function of LRP-2, radiolabeled LRP-2 solution was preincubated with RAP (1 μm) for 1 h at room temperature prior to incubation with the membranes. Following the incubation, the membranes were washed with TBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 and exposed to Kodak BioMax MR film (Eastman Kodak Company, Rochester, NY) at room temperature. For non-radioactive probing, filters were incubated with unlabeled LRP-2 (1 nm) in blocking buffer containing 5 mmCaCl2 and 0.05% Tween 20 for 3 h at room temperature. Bound receptor was detected using mouse anti-LRP-2 IgG (1 μg/ml), anti-mouse IgG-HRP, and the ECL Plus Western blotting detection system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Seminal vesicle fluid, isolated in the presence of spermine and spermidine, was electrophoretically separated on a 4–12% acrylamide gel in the presence of SDS, under non-reducing conditions. The gel was stained with 0.2% Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 (Bio-Rad) in 45% methanol, 10% acetic acid. The polypeptide band having an M r corresponding to that identified in seminal fluid by gel-blot overlay assay using radioiodinated LRP-2 as probe was excised. The gel slice was minced, and the pieces were washed and destained in 50% methanol for 18 h. The gel pieces were dehydrated in acetonitrile and rehydrated in 10 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 m ammonium bicarbonate and reduced at 55 °C for 1 h. The dithiothreitol solution was removed, and the sample was alkylated in 50 mmiodoacetamide, 0.1 m ammonium bicarbonate for 1 h at room temperature in the dark. The gel pieces were washed with 0.1m ammonium bicarbonate and dehydrated in acetonitrile for 5 min. The acetonitrile was removed, and the gel slices were rehydrated in 0.1 m ammonium bicarbonate. The pieces were again dehydrated in acetonitrile and dried by vacuum centrifugation. The gel pieces were rehydrated in a solution of trypsin (12.5 ng/μl) in 0.1m ammonium bicarbonate and incubated on ice for 45 min. The trypsin-containing solution was removed, 0.05 m ammonium bicarbonate was added, and the slices were incubated for 18 h at 37 °C. The proteolytic fragments were then extracted using 50% acetonitrile, 5% formic acid and dried to <20 μl. The sample was then analyzed by capillary high performance liquid chromatography-electrospray tandem mass spectrometry using a Finningan-MAT TSQ7000 located in the W. M. Keck Biomedical Mass Spectrometry Laboratory (University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA). Both homologous and heterologous ligand displacement assays were carried out as described previously (25Williams S.E. Ashcom J.D. Argraves W.S. Strickland D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9035-9040Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Radioiodinated proteins (1–2 nm) in TBS, 3% bovine serum albumin (U. S. Biochemical Corp.), 5 mmCaCl2, 0.05% Tween 20 were incubated for 3 h at room temperature in breakaway microtiter wells (Dynatech, Chantilly, VA) coated with LRP-2, SVS-II, or ovalbumin (each coated at 3 μg/ml) in the presence of increasing concentrations of the competitor. The wells were washed with TBS, 5 mm CaCl2, 0.05% Tween 20, and bound radioactivity was determined using a gamma counter. The computer program Ligand (26Munson P.J. Rodbard D. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 107: 220-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (7772) Google Scholar) was used to analyze the competition data and to determine dissociation constants (K d) for receptor-ligand interactions. Ligand internalization and degradation by LRP-2 expressing cells was performed according to previously published methods (24Stefansson S. Chappell D.A. Argraves K.M. Strickland D.K. Argraves W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19417-19421Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 27Kounnas M.Z. Loukinova E.B. Stefansson S. Harmony J.A.K. Brewer B.H. Strickland D.K.

Briefly, RA- and Bt2cAMP-treated F9 cells were plated into 3.83-cm2 wells at 1.5–1.75 × 105 cells/well and allowed to grow for 18 h at 37 °C, 5% CO2. Prior to the addition of radioactive ligands, the cells were washed with DMEM and incubated in the assay medium (DMEM, 20 mm HEPES, 1% Nutridoma serum substitute (Boehringer Mannheim), penicillin/streptomycin, and 1.2% bovine serum albumin) containing either SVS-II (1 μm), RAP (1 μm) or IgGs (200 μg/ml) for 0.5 h at 37 °C, 5% CO2. To inhibit the lysosomal protease activity, the cells were pretreated with 0.1 mm chloroquine (Sigma) for 0.5 h at 37 °C, 5% CO2. The pre-incubation medium was removed, and medium containing the radioiodinated proteins (1 nm) plus competitors was added and incubated for 5 h at 37 °C, 5% CO2. The conditioned culture medium was treated with trichloroacetic acid (final concentration 10%) and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min. The amount of radioactivity present in the supernatant was taken to represent the amount of degraded SVS-II (28Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 5153-5162Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The cell layer was washed three times with cold (4 °C) Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline and then treated with 0.5 mg/ml trypsin, 50 μg/ml proteinase K, and 0.5 mm EDTA (all from Sigma) in Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline for 2–4 min at 4 °C. The released cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 1,300 × g for 15 min, and the amount of radioactivity in the cell pellet was measured. We have recently found that LRP-2 was expressed on apical surfaces of epithelial cells lining the efferent ducts and in the intermediate zone, proximal head, corpus, and caudal regions of the epididymis (2Morales C.R. Igdoura S.A. Wosu U.A. Boman J. Argraves W.S. Biol. Reprod. 1996; 55: 676-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In the present study, we have examined LRP-2 expression in the accessory sex gland, the seminal vesicle. As shown in Fig.1, using affinity-selected LRP-2 antibodies, pronounced immunoperoxidase staining was observed on the apical regions of epithelial cells covering the duct of the gland. In addition, LRP-2 staining was also strong in the apical portion of the epithelial cells lining the ampulla (Fig. 1 C). This staining also appeared to occur in budding vesicles (Fig. 1 C,arrow). Very weak LRP-2 staining was seen in the underlying stroma lying adjacent to the LRP-2-expressing epithelial cells. Examination of distal segments of the gland showed negligible LRP-2 staining in both the epithelial cells and the underlying stromal cells (data not shown). The results indicate that LRP-2 is expressed by epithelial cells lining the duct of the seminal vesicles and may be present within secreted vesicular particles. The expression of LRP-2 in the seminal vesicle prompted us to examine seminal vesicle fluid for the presence of LRP-2-binding proteins. Seminal vesicle fluid collected in the presence of the polyamines spermine and spermidine, to prevent coagulation, was electrophoretically separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (under non-reducing conditions) and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The membrane-bound proteins were probed using125I-LRP-2. As shown in Fig.2, the radiolabeled receptor bound to a polypeptide with an M r of 100,000 (Fig.2 A). Other minor LRP-2-binding bands were also apparent in the profile. As a control, the 125I-LRP-2 was shown to bind to a known LRP-2 ligand, the 39-kDa RAP (29Kounnas M.Z. Argraves W.S. Strickland D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21162-21166Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30Orlando R.A. Kerjaschki D. Kurihara H. Biemesderfer D. Farquhar M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Cytochem. 1992; 40: 1481-1490Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Fibulin-1, a non-LRP-2-binding protein did not exhibit binding to the radiolabeled receptor in this assay. To evaluate the specificity of the binding interaction between the receptor and the 100-kDa protein, duplicate filters were incubated with125I-LRP-2 in the presence of RAP, an antagonist of the ligand binding activity of LRP-2 (19Kounnas M.Z. Stefansson S. Loukinova E. Argraves K.M. Strickland D.K. Argraves W.S. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1994; 737: 114-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2 C, RAP completely blocked binding of radioiodinated LRP-2 to the 100-kDa protein. The results indicate that seminal vesicle fluid contains a 100-kDa protein that binds to LRP-2. Consistent with all other LRP-2 ligands (19Kounnas M.Z. Stefansson S. Loukinova E. Argraves K.M. Strickland D.K. Argraves W.S. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1994; 737: 114-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), the binding of the 100-kDa protein to LRP-2 was inhibited by RAP. To identify the 100-kDa LRP-2-binding protein, amino acid sequence analysis was performed. Initial attempts to sequence the N terminus of the LRP-2-binding protein using Edman degradation did not yield a sequence. Assuming that the protein might be N-terminal blocked, it was subjected to limited proteolysis, and the resulting fragments were evaluated by liquid capillary mass spectrometry and high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. As a result, sequences were obtained from 13 peptides (TableII). Data base analysis of these sequences revealed that eleven corresponded to sequences contained within rat seminal vesicle secretory protein (SVS-II) (32Harris S.E. Harris M.A. Johnson C.M. Bean M.F. Dodd J.G. Matusik R.J. Carr S.A. Crabb J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 9896-9903Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). SVS-II is a 48-kDa seminal fluid protein that forms a 100-kDa disulfide-linked homodimer (16Wagner C.L. Kistler W.S. Biol. Reprod. 1987; 36: 501-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 17Seitz J. Keppler C. Aumuller G. Polzar B. Mannherz H.G. Eur J. Cell Biol. 1992; 57: 308-316PubMed Google Scholar, 32Harris S.E.

Sequences from two of the peptides were unidentifiable. The results indicate that the 100-kDa-LRP-2-binding protein most likely corresponds to SVS-II.Table IIMass spectroscopic sequence analysis of trypsin-generated proteolytic fragments of 100-kDa seminal vesicle fluid proteinPeptide numberMeasured molecular massPeptide sequence by collisionally activated dissociationPeptide sequence of SVS-II from data baseAmino acid position within rat SVS-IIDacalculated molecular mass, Dacalculated molecular mass, Da1697.8SFGQMKSFGQMK (697.8)184–1892870.5_ _XAQYR (b2 = 221)GYLAQYR (871.0)376–3823886.6_ _XNFGXK (b2 = 195)GHLNFGLK (886.0)44–5141052.8SFDQDAQXKSFDQDAQLK (1052.8)271–27951055.0SYGEETQXKSYGEETQLK (1055.1)262–27061106.2_ _AGXYQAQXKGGAGLYQAQLK (1106.2)403–41371163.0NAGXYQAQXGK (1163.3)U.I.81183.4QSYx - - - GXKU.I.91274.8_ _NQDNFFTK (b2 = 262)NFNQDNFFTK (1275.4)393–402101368.6_ _AMDEDXSQVR (b2 = 205)GFAMDEDLSQVR (1368.5)322–333111384.6_ _AM(o)DEDXSQVR (b2 = 205)GFAM(o)DEDLSQVR (1384.5)322–333121428.2_ _GGQXQSYGQM(o)SQGGQXQSYGQM(o)216–228131439.0TEEDXSQFGQQRTEEDLSQFGQQR353–364X designates isoleucine or leucine which cannot be distinguished by low energy collisionally activated dissociation; M(o) designates oxidized methionine; lowercase letters designate tentative assignments; _ designates an unknown amino acid; - - - designates an unknown number of unknown amino acids; b2 = refers to the mass (in Da) of the first two amino acid residues; UI indicates that the peptide sequence obtained did not correspond to any sequence in the database.

To confirm that LRP-2 binds to SVS-II, solid phase binding assays were performed using purified components. SVS-II was purified from rat seminal vesicle fluid according to previously published methods (16Wagner C.L. Kistler W.S. Biol. Reprod. 1987; 36: 501-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.3 A, 125I-LRP-2 bound to purified SVS-II immobilized on microtiter well plastic but not to ovalbumin-coated wells. The binding to SVS-II could be inhibited by incubation with unlabeled LRP-2. A dissociation constant (K d) of 10.4 ± 4.9 nm(n = 6) was determined for the binding of radiolabeled LRP-2 to SVS-II from the best fit of the data to a single class of binding sites model. Similarly, 125I-SVS-II was shown to bind to wells coated with LRP-2, but not to ovalbumin-coated wells (Fig. 3 B). A K d of 5.8 ± 2.5 nm (n = 5) was determined for the binding of SVS-II to immobilized LRP-2. The differences in the observedK d values derived from the two types of assays may reflect conformational differences between the solution phase and plastic-absorbed proteins. In addition, the LRP-2 antagonist RAP was shown to competitively inhibit 125I-SVS-II binding to LRP-2-coated wells (Fig. 3 C), and an inhibition constant (K i) of 9.0 ± 2.5 nm(n = 4) was determined. The findings indicate that LRP-2 can bind to SVS-II with high affinity and that the interaction can be blocked by RAP. Given that LRP-2 shares a number of ligands in common with LRP-1, we were interested in evaluating the ability of LRP-1 to bind to SVS-II. As shown in Fig. 4 A,125I-LRP-1 bound to purified SVS-II immobilized on microtiter well plastic, and the binding could be inhibited by incubation with solution phase SVS-II. Additionally,125I-SVS-II was found to bind to wells coated with LRP-1 but not to ovalbumin-coated wells (Fig. 4 B). AK d of 1.4 ± 1.0 nm(n = 3) was determined for the binding of SVS-II to immobilized LRP-1. RAP was found to also inhibit the binding of SVS-II to immobilized LRP-1 (K i = 4.4 ± 0.6 nm) (Fig. 4 C). A K i of 16.5 ± 3.5 nm (n = 2) was determined for SVS-II inhibition of binding of radiolabeled LRP-1 to immobilized SVS-II. The results indicate that LRP-1, like LRP-2 can bind to SVS-IIin vitro; however, given that LRP-1 was not immunologically detected in the seminal vesicle (data not shown), the significance of this interaction remains uncertain. To determine the binding site within the SVS-II protein, a series of fragments of SVS-II were generated recombinantly and evaluated for their ability to promote LRP-2 binding in gel-blot overlay assays. The recombinant fragments corresponding to the 85-residue N-terminal domain, the 103-residue C-terminal domain, or the 204-residue 13-residue repeat domain of SVS-II (Fig.5) were expressed as fusions with GST. As shown in Fig. 6, LRP-2 bound the 204-residue 13-residue-repeat domain-containing fragment but not the N- and C-terminal domain fragments. As controls, LRP-2 bound filter-immobilized SVS-II and RAP, but not GST. LRP-2 binding to SVS-II, the 204-residue 13-residue-repeat domain-containing fragment and RAP was inhibited by RAP (Fig. 6, C).Figure 6LRP-2 binds to a central 13-residue-repeat domain within SVS-II. Shown in panel A is a Coomassie-stained 4–12% polyacrylamide gradient gel containing molecular weight standards, (lane 1), GST (1 μg;lane 2), SVS-II N-terminal domain-GST fusion protein (1 μg; lane 3), SVS-II C-terminal domain-GST fusion protein (1 μg; lane 4), SVS-II 13-residue-repeat domain-GST fusion protein (1 μg; lane 5), rat SVS-II protein (1 μg;lane 6), and RAP (1 μg; lane 8) electrophoretically separated in the absence of reducing agent.Panels B and C show autoradiographs of a membrane containing proteins from duplicate gels that were transferred to PVDF membranes and probed with LRP-2 (1 nm; panel B) or LRP-2 plus RAP (1 μm) and detected with monoclonal anti-LRP-2 antibody. Indicated on the left are molecular mass values of the marker proteins in kDa.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To determine whether LRP-2 functions to mediate endocytosis leading to lysosomal degradation of SVS-II, we evaluated the ability of LRP-2-expressing cells to internalize and degrade radioiodinated SVS-II. As shown in Fig.7, cultured F9 cells, treated to augment expression of LRP-2 (24Stefansson S. Chappell D.A. Argraves K.M. Strickland D.K. Argraves W.S. J. Biol.

Both processes could be inhibited by polyclonal LRP-2 antibodies that have been previously shown to block LRP-2 function (24Stefansson S. Chappell D.A. Argraves K.M. Strickland D.K. Argraves W.S. J.

The magnitude of the inhibition by LRP-2 antibodies (200 μg/ml) was nearly as great as that obtained using either 1000-fold molar excess of unlabeled SVS-II or RAP as competitors. The degradation of radiolabeled SVS-II was inhibited by chloroquine (Fig. 7 A), a drug that blocks lysosomal proteinase activity through its ability to increase the pH of lysosomal vesicles. As expected, the chloroquine treatment resulted in an intracellular accumulation of 125I-SVS-II (Fig.7 B). The findings indicate that LRP-2 can function to mediate endocytosis and lysosomal degradation of125I-SVS-II. Evidence is presented in this study to indicate that LRP-2, a multi-ligand endocytic receptor and a member of the LDL receptor family, is expressed by seminal vesicle epithelial cells and is potentially a component of seminal vesicle-secretory vesicles. In addition, it was discovered that LRP-2 binds with high affinity (K d = 5.6 nm) to SVS-II, a prominent seminal vesicle-derived coagulatory protein. The LRP-2 binding site was mapped to a 204-amino acid region of the protein containing a series of 13-residue repeats. As evidence that LRP-2 is also capable of mediating cellular clearance of SVS-II, LRP-2-expressing cells were shown to endocytose and degrade SVS-II. Both processes can be inhibited by anti-LRP-2 IgG or RAP, a known antagonist of LRP-2 function (23Kounnas M.Z. Chappell D.A. Strickland D.K. Argraves W.S. J. Biol.

LRP-2-mediated endocytosis of SVS-II may functionin vivo to clear multimerized and/or transglutaminase-cross-linked SVS-II, thereby preventing coagulation within the male reproductive tract and the urinary tract which might lead to an obstruction. Proteinaceous plugs have been reported in the accessory sex glands and urinary bladders of male rats (35Kunstyr I. Kupper W. Weisser H. Naumann S. Messow C. Lab. Anim. 1982; 16: 151-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 36Lee K.P. Lab. Anim. Sci. 1986; 36: 671-677PubMed Google Scholar). The expression of LRP-2 in epithelial cells proximal to the ductal region of the gland might be important to clear SVS-II that has become cross-linked by retrograde flow of transglutaminase-containing fluids derived from the coagulatory and prostate glands. LRP-2 that is expressed by epithelial cells lining the female reproductive tract (1Zheng G. Bachinsky D.R. Stamenkovic I. Strickland D.K. Brown D. Andres G. McCluskey R.T. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1994; 42: 531-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar,4Sayegh R.A. Tao X.J. Isaacson K.B. J. Soc. Gynecol. Invest. 1995; 6: 748-753Google Scholar, 37Assmann K.J. Lange W.P.

Indeed, following copulation, seminal vesicle antigens have been detected within uterine epithelial cells, indicative of endocytosis as a mechanism of their elimination (38Carballada R. Esponda P. J. Reprod. Fertil. 1997; 109: 325-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Immunohistological staining of the seminal vesicle not only showed LRP-2 to be localized within the epithelial cells lining the ductal region of the gland, but possibly in membrane bound vesicular bodies found in the lumen of the gland. While LRP-2-expressing epithelial cells lacking apparent vesicular budding were observed, numerous regions of epithelium in the ductal area appeared to be active in secretion of LRP-2-containing vesicular bodies. The pronounced LRP-2 staining of the budding vesicles in these areas may indicate that LRP-2 serves a role in vesicle secretion. Vesicular bodies have been observed by electron microscopy in the lumen of the seminal vesicle and other reproductive organs including the epididymis, vas deferens and ampulla (39Agrawal Y. Vanha-Perttula T. J. Androl. 1988; 9: 307-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In addition, such vesicular bodies have been isolated from seminal vesicle (39Agrawal Y. Vanha-Perttula T. J. Androl. 1988; 9: 307-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 40Agrawal Y. Vanha-Perttula T. J. Reprod. Fertil. 1987; 79: 409-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 41Renneberg H.

Following our previous finding of LRP-2 expression by epididymal epithelial cells (2Morales C.R. Igdoura S.A. Wosu U.A. Boman J. Argraves W.S. Biol. Reprod. 1996; 55: 676-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), we isolated vesicular bodies from rat cauda epididymal fluid and found that they contained LRP-2 (unpublished observations, Ranganathan and Argraves). Vesicular bodies in seminal and epididymal fluids have been speculated to play a role in sperm maturation, perhaps involving proteolytic and glycolytic modification of spermatozoa membrane glycoproteins (46Jones R. Pholpramool C. Setchell B.P. Brown C.R. Biochem. J. 1981; 200: 457-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 47Chapman D.A. Killian G.J. Biol.

It remains to be determined what role is served by LRP-2 associated with seminal and epididymal vesicular bodies."
