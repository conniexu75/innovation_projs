https://openalex.org/W2891487803,"Marine recreational fishing (MRF) has been shown to substantially contribute to fishing mortality of marine fish. However, European MRF catches are only quantified for a small number of stocks, so it is unclear whether a significant part of fishing mortality is excluded from stock assessments. This study estimated: (i) European MRF removals, which were defined as landings plus dead releases; and (ii) impact at stock level by comparing the percentage contribution to total removal by MRF and commercial fishing. As MRF data were limited for some European countries, catches were reconstructed using a mixture of average release proportions, average fish weights, and extrapolation using the catch per fisher of the nearest country providing catch estimates. Where catch reconstructions exceeded 50%, data were excluded from further analysis. Furthermore, as MRF survey methodology can be variable, semi-quantitative estimates of bias and error were calculated for each stock. Only 10 of the 20 stocks assessed in this study had sufficient MRF data for full reliable estimates. Percentage contribution to total removals (MRF + commercial removals) by MRF ranged between 2% for Atlantic mackerel in the North Sea and Skagerrak and 43% for Atlantic pollack in the Celtic Seas and English Channel. The biomass removed ranged between 297 (± 116) tonnes (Atlantic cod in the western English Channel and southern Celtic seas) and 4820 (± 1889) tonnes (Atlantic mackerel in the North Sea and Skagerrak), but the errors were substantial. Additionally, the bias in the estimated removals was low for most stocks, with some positive biases found. The present study indicates that removals by MRF can represent a high proportion of the total removals for some European marine fish stocks, so inclusion in stock assessments should be routine. To achieve this, regular surveys of MRF are required to collect data essential for stock assessments."
https://openalex.org/W2891442850,"Caesarean section (CS) has been on the rise worldwide and Bangladesh is no exception. In Bangladesh, the CS rate, which includes both institutional and community-based deliveries, has increased from about 3% in 2000 to about 24% in 2014. This study examines the association of reported complications around delivery and socio-demographic, healthcare and spatial characteristics of mothers with CS, using data from the latest Bangladesh Demographic and Health Survey (BDHS).The study is based on data from the 2014 BDHS. BDHS is a nationally representative survey which is conducted periodically and 2014 is the latest of the BDHS conducted. Data collected from 4,627 mothers who gave birth in health care institutions in three years preceding the survey were used in this study.Average age of the mothers was 24.6 years, while their average years of schooling were 3.2. Factors like mother being older, obese, residing in urban areas, first birth, maternal perception of large newborn size, husband being a professional, had higher number of antenatal care (ANC) visits, seeking ANC from private providers, and delivering in a private facility were statistically associated with higher rates of CS.Bangladesh health system urgently needs policy guideline with monitoring of clinical indications of CS deliveries to avoid unnecessary CS. Strict adherence to this guideline, along with enhance knowledge on the unsafe nature of the unnecessary CS can achieve increased institutional normal delivery in future; otherwise, an emergency procedure may end up being a lucrative practice."
https://openalex.org/W2892178600,"Urban agriculture has become a common form of urban land use in European cities linked to multiple environmental, social and economic benefits, as well as to diversified forms (from self-production allotments to high-tech companies). Social acceptance will determine the development of urban agriculture and specific knowledge on citizens’ perception is required in order to set the basis for policy-making and planning. The ecosystem services provided by urban agriculture can be determinant in this process. The goal of this paper is to evaluate the social acceptance and the perceived ecosystem services of urban agriculture in the city of Bologna (Italy), as an example of a Southern European city. In particular, we evaluated the preferences for urban land uses, for different typologies of urban agriculture and for the resulting products, the perceived provision of ecosystem services and the willingness to engage in new initiatives. A survey that investigated these topics (including open questions, closed questions and Likert-scale evaluation) was performed on the citizens of Bologna (n = 380) between October and November 2016. Results showed that urban agriculture is widely accepted by the inhabitants of Bologna, particularly regarding vegetable production. Although intensive farming systems were the least preferred forms to be implemented in Bologna, citizens highly accepted a large variety of urban agriculture goods, with preference for those obtained from plants as compared to animal products. The willingness-to-pay for urban food products was mostly the same as for conventional ones, although the participants recognised the social values, proximity and quality of the former. Socio-cultural ecosystem services were perceived as more valuable than environmental ones. Policy-making recommendations can be extracted from the results to facilitate the development of urban agriculture plans and policies."
https://openalex.org/W2761005618,"Overexpression of the oncogene MYBL2 (B-Myb) is associated with increased cell proliferation and serves as a marker of poor prognosis in cancer. However, the mechanism by which B-Myb alters the cell cycle is not fully understood. In proliferating cells, B-Myb interacts with the MuvB core complex including LIN9, LIN37, LIN52, RBBP4, and LIN54, forming the MMB (Myb–MuvB) complex, and promotes transcription of genes required for mitosis. Alternatively, the MuvB core interacts with Rb-like protein p130 and E2F4–DP1 to form the DREAM complex that mediates global repression of cell cycle genes in G0/G1, including a subset of MMB target genes. Here, we show that overexpression of B-Myb disrupts the DREAM complex in human cells, and this activity depends on the intact MuvB-binding domain in B-Myb. Furthermore, we found that B-Myb regulates the protein expression levels of the MuvB core subunit LIN52, a key adapter for assembly of both the DREAM and MMB complexes, by a mechanism that requires S28 phosphorylation site in LIN52. Given that high expression of B-Myb correlates with global loss of repression of DREAM target genes in breast and ovarian cancer, our findings offer mechanistic insights for aggressiveness of cancers with MYBL2 amplification, and establish the rationale for targeting B-Myb to restore cell cycle control."
https://openalex.org/W2890544229,"Between 1985 and 2014, the number of US doctoral graduates in Anthropology increased from about 350 to 530 graduates per year. This rise in doctorates entering the work force along with an overall decrease in the numbers of tenure-track academic positions has resulted in highly competitive academic job market. We estimate that approximately79% of US anthropology doctorates do not obtain tenure-track positions at BA/BS, MA/MS, and PhD institutions in the US. Here, we examine where US anthropology faculty obtained their degrees and where they ultimately end up teaching as tenure-track faculty. Using data derived from the 2014–2015 AnthroGuide and anthropology departmental web pages, we identify and rank PhD programs in terms of numbers of graduates who have obtained tenure-track academic jobs; examine long-term and ongoing trends in the programs producing doctorates for the discipline as a whole, as well as for the subfields of archaeology, bioanthropology, and sociocultural anthropology; and discuss gender inequity in academic anthropology within the US."
https://openalex.org/W2891779901,"Climate change has caused shifts in the phenology and distributions of many species but comparing responses across species is challenged by inconsistencies in the methodology and taxonomic and temporal scope of individual studies. Natural history collections offer a rich source of data for examining phenological shifts for a large number of species. We paired specimen records from Pacific Northwest insect collections to climate data to analyze the responses of 215 moth species to interannual climate variation over a period of 119 years (1895–2013) during which average annual temperatures have increased in the region. We quantified the effects of late winter/early spring temperatures, averaged annually across the region, on dates of occurrence of adults, taking into account the effects of elevation, latitude, and longitude. We assessed whether species-specific phenological responses varied with adult flight season and larval diet breadth. Collection dates were significantly earlier in warmer years for 36.3% of moth species, and later for 3.7%. Species exhibited an average phenological advance of 1.9 days/°C, but species-specific shifts ranged from an advance of 10.3 days/°C to a delay of 10.6 days/°C. More spring-flying species shifted their phenology than summer- or fall-flying species. These responses did not vary among groups defined by larval diet breadth. The highly variable phenological responses to climate change in Pacific Northwest moths agree with other studies on Lepidoptera and suggest that it will remain difficult to accurately forecast which species and ecological interactions are most likely to be affected by climate change. Our results also underscore the value of natural history collections as windows into long-term ecological trends."
https://openalex.org/W2890058925,"The type I cGMP-dependent protein kinase (PKG I) is an essential regulator of vascular tone. It has been demonstrated that the type Iα isoform can be constitutively activated by oxidizing conditions. However, the amino acid residues implicated in this phenomenon are not fully elucidated. To investigate the molecular basis for this mechanism, we studied the effects of oxidation using recombinant WT, truncated, and mutant constructs of PKG I. Using an in vitro assay, we observed that oxidation with hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) resulted in constitutive, cGMP-independent activation of PKG Iα. PKG Iα C42S and a truncation construct that does not contain Cys-42 (Δ53) were both constitutively activated by H2O2. In contrast, oxidation of PKG Iα C117S maintained its cGMP-dependent activation characteristics, although oxidized PKG Iα C195S did not. To corroborate these results, we also tested the effects of our constructs on the PKG Iα–specific substrate, the large conductance potassium channel (KCa 1.1). Application of WT PKG Iα activated by either cGMP or H2O2 increased the open probabilities of the channel. Neither cGMP nor H2O2 activation of PKG Iα C42S significantly increased channel open probabilities. Moreover, cGMP-stimulated PKG Iα C117S increased KCa 1.1 activity, but this effect was not observed under oxidizing conditions. Finally, we observed that PKG Iα C42S caused channel flickers, indicating dramatically altered KCa 1.1 channel characteristics compared with channels exposed to WT PKG Iα. Cumulatively, these results indicate that constitutive activation of PKG Iα proceeds through oxidation of Cys-117 and further suggest that the formation of a sulfur acid is necessary for this phenotype.

The proposed mechanism involves the formation of an intermolecular disulfide bond between Cys-42 and Cys-42′ from the opposing protomer in the homodimeric holoenzyme.

In this study, we sought to isolate these two facets of PKG Iα signaling by studying the effects of oxidation using recombinant WT, truncated, and mutant constructs of PKG I. We found that both PKG Iα and Iβ are activated by oxidation, although its effect on PKG Iα is more pronounced. Furthermore, both PKG Iα C42S and Δ53 PKG Iα (a truncation mutant that does not contain Cys-42) are activated by oxidation. Using PKG Iα C117S and C195S to test the influence of a previously observed disulfide bond, we observed that oxidation at Cys-117 is necessary and sufficient for oxidative activation of PKG Iα. Finally, we corroborated these in vitro results by measuring the PKG Iα–dependent activation of the KCa 1.1 channel. Taken together, these data support the hypothesis that constitutive activation of PKG Iα via oxidation is not mediated through the interprotomer disulfide bond between Cys-42 and Cys-42′, but rather through oxyacid formation at Cys-117 in the cGMP-A site. Under oxidizing conditions, there are two confirmed sites where disulfide bonds form in the PKG Iα holoenzyme, which are an interprotomer disulfide bond between Cys-42 and Cys-42′ and an intraprotomer disulfide bond between Cys-117 and Cys-195 (Fig. 1A) (11Landgraf W.

The first disulfide bond between Cys-42 and Cys-42′ forms at the C-terminal region of the dimerization domain (Fig. 1B). Cys-42 is one of four nonleucine/isoleucine residues at d positions within the coiled-coil and is unique to this isoform (Fig. S2A). The second disulfide bond in cGMP-A forms between Cys-117 and Cys-195 and is proximal to the cGMP-binding pocket (Fig. 1C and Fig. S2B). To characterize the oxidative phenotype, recombinant PKG Iα from Sf9 cells was used for in vitro phosphotransferase assays, wherein changes in kinase activity could be monitored.

Exposure to increasing concentrations of cGMP activated the kinase in a cooperative manner (nH = 1.7) by 20-fold with a half-maximal concentration of 200 nm (Fig. 2A and Table 1). We next examined how increasing H2O2 concentrations affected PKG Iα activity. WTred was exposed to H2O2, and kinase activity was monitored under apo and saturating cGMP conditions (Fig. 2B). A maximum response was observed with 500 μm H2O2, wherein we observed a reduction in the maximal velocity paired with a peak in the minimum velocity. At 1 mm H2O2, we observed a relative loss of activity in the presence and absence of cGMP, suggesting that exposure of the enzyme to this concentration of H2O2 had compromised its catalytic function. To expand our understanding of the conditions in which to measure the oxidative phenotype, the -fold activation of PKG Iα was monitored over a timed exposure to 500 μm H2O2 (Fig. 2C). After 30 min of exposure, we observed the greatest effect on the cGMP-dependent activation of the kinase, wherein the -fold activation was reduced by ∼90% to 2.5 (Table 1). These conditions were used for all subsequent measurements of the oxidation phenotype.Table 1cGMP-dependent phosphotransferase activityConstructsReducedOxidizedVminaThe velocity values indicate the μmol of peptide substrate (W15) phosphorylated/min/mg of PKG (μmol/min × mg) and are represented as the mean ± S.D.VmaxaThe velocity values indicate the μmol of peptide substrate (W15) phosphorylated/min/mg of PKG (μmol/min × mg) and are represented as the mean ± S.D.Vmax/VminKabValues were obtained from non-linear regression fit analyses and are represented as the means ± standard deviations.

Oxidation resulted in a 5–6-fold increase in basal activity in the absence of cGMP (1.13 μmol/min × mg; p < 0.001 compared with WTred; Fig. 2A). In contrast, the addition of up to 4 μm cGMP increased the activity by only 2.5-fold (2.77 μmol/min × mg). Moreover, the activation profile of WTox with cGMP showed a decreased sensitivity for the cyclic nucleotide. In agreement with previous studies, analysis of WT PKG Iα by nonreducing SDS-PAGE showed that increasing concentrations of H2O2 resulted in formation of an interprotomer disulfide bond (Fig. 2D). In determining whether our PKG I constructs formed the interprotomer disulfide bond using nonreducing, SDS-PAGE electrophoresis, preliminary experiments indicated that removal of the reducing agent from the storage buffer would expose the enzymes to ambient air. Because prior studies have used ambient air to activate PKG Iα by oxidation, we sought to avoid this contribution by retaining the reducing agent, tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine (TCEP), in the buffer and adding H2O2 to levels that would overcome its reducing capacity (Fig. S1) (11Landgraf W. Regulla S. Meyer H.E. Hofmann F. Oxidation of cysteines activates cGMP-dependent protein kinase.J. Biol.

Because TCEP is degraded by H2O2 through oxidation to a phosphine oxide at a 1:1 ratio, the excess H2O2 could be calculated (31Han J. Yen S. Han G. Han P. Quantitation of hydrogen peroxide using tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine.Anal. Biochem. 1996; 234 (8742092): 107-10910.1006/abio.1996.0059Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 32Tan Z. Ihnat P.M.

Next, we examined whether the oxidized phenotype in PKG Iα is regulated by formation of the interprotomer disulfide bond between Cys-42 and Cys-42′. To achieve this, we measured the activities of reduced and oxidized PKG Iα C42S (C42Sred and C42Sox) (Fig. 3A and Table 1). When the mutant was measured under reducing conditions, we observed a basal activity similar to that of WTred (0.32 μmol/min× mg). However, when activated by cGMP, the maximal velocity was reduced by ∼50% compared with WTred (2.31 μmol/min × mg), resulting in a 7-fold stimulation of activity. Moreover, C42Sred showed a 3-fold shift in the activation constant (Ka = 580 nm, p < 0.001 compared with WTred) and a loss of cooperative, cGMP-dependent activation (nH = 0.8). For C42Sox, we observed a significant increase in basal activity (1.103 μmol/min × mg; p < 0.001 compared with C42Sred); however, the maximal activity was unchanged (2.357 μmol/min× mg) and displayed kinetic characteristics similar to those of WTox. Examination of C42Sox by nonreducing, denaturing SDS-PAGE did not show evidence of an intramolecular disulfide bond between protomers (Fig. 3E). Due to the similar increases in basal activity between WTox and C42Sox in response to H2O2, we next utilized Δ53 PKG Iα, a truncation construct of PKG Iα that lacks the N terminus (and Cys-42) but retains cGMP-dependent activation (30Moon T.M. Sheehe J.L. Nukareddy P. Nausch L.W. Wohlfahrt J. Matthews D.E. Blumenthal D.K. Dostmann W.R. An N-terminally truncated form of cyclic GMP-dependent protein kinase iα (PKG Iα) is monomeric, autoinhibited, and provides a model for activation.J. Biol.

Δ53red activity in the absence of cGMP was similar to WT PKG Iα (Fig. 3B). In the presence of increasing concentrations of cGMP, Δ53 activity increased by 20-fold with a Ka for cGMP that was similar to that of WT PKG Iα (216 nm). When oxidized with H2O2, Δ53ox exhibited kinetic features similar to those of the WTox and C42Sox constructs. Specifically, the 7-fold increase in basal activity of Δ53ox to 1.380 μmol/min × mg decreased its cGMP-dependent -fold activation to 1.1. Thus, Δ53 displayed the highest sensitivity to oxidation. Like C42S, SDS-PAGE analyses showed that Δ53 does not form an interprotomer disulfide bond in the presence of H2O2 (Fig. 3E). Because PKG Iα and Iβ are splice variants of the prkg1 gene, within the same species, they are completely identical in their cGMP-binding and catalytic domains (with 98% sequence identity across placental mammals). However, their N-terminal dimerization, autoinhibitory, and linker regions only retain 26% sequence identity (Fig. S2). Thus, Cys-42 in the N terminus of Iα is not conserved in PKG Iβ. Upon ruling out the contribution of Cys-42 on the oxidation-dependent activation phenotype of PKG Iα, we hypothesized that oxidative activation may originate within the sequence-conserved regulatory domain. To test this, we first examined reduced and oxidized PKG Iβ. PKG Iβ stimulated by cGMP under reducing conditions displayed a cooperative, 86-fold stimulation of activity with a Ka of 1.21 μm (Table 1 and Fig. S3). When PKG Iβ was oxidized with H2O2, a 10-fold increase in basal activity was observed (0.42 μmol/min × mg) paired with a 1.3-fold decrease in maximal velocity (2.780 μmol/min × mg), resulting in a reduction of the cGMP-stimulated -fold activation to 6.6. In addition, under oxidizing conditions, the activation constant for PKG Iβ decreased by 1.4-fold (Ka = 0.86 μm), and cooperativity was reduced to 1.2. These data suggest that oxidation also affects the activity of the Iβ isoform. In addition to the interprotomer disulfide bond between Cys-42 and Cys-42′, Landgraf et al. (11Landgraf W. Regulla S. Meyer H.E. Hofmann F. Oxidation of cysteines activates cGMP-dependent protein kinase.J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266 (1653229): 16305-16311Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) also confirmed the presence of an intraprotomer disulfide bond between Cys-117 and Cys-195. This disulfide bond has been observed in the crystal structure of the PKG I regulatory domain (PDB code 3SHR) (27Osborne B.W. Wu J. McFarland C.J. Nickl C.K. Sankaran B. Casteel D.E. Woods Jr., V.L. Kornev A.P. Taylor S.S. Dostmann W.R.

Due to its location in the first cGMP-binding domain (CNB-A), we hypothesized that this disulfide bond may control oxidative activation of PKG Iα. To test this, we expressed and purified the PKG Iα C117S mutant. Under reducing conditions, C117Sred had a low basal activity that was similar to that of PKG Iα WTred (Fig. 3C). Furthermore, activation of C117Sred with cGMP increased the activity by 26-fold with positive cooperativity (nH = 1.4), resulting in a Vmax of 4.09 μmol/min × mg and a Ka of 130 nm. In contrast to PKG Iα WT, stimulation of C117Sox by cGMP resulted in only a slight increase in basal activity and no significant change in its maximal velocity compared with C117Sred (3.81 μmol/min × mg). However, the Ka for cGMP was increased, and the cooperativity showed a slight, but not statistically significant, decrease (nH = 1.2) compared with C117Sred. These data suggest that the response to H2O2 is highly attenuated by introduction of the C117S mutation. To determine whether oxidative activation depends on disulfide bond formation with Cys-195, we next examined the C195S construct. Under reducing conditions, the overall kinetic profile of C195Sred was not significantly different from that of WTred. However, the basal and maximal activities were slightly elevat"

The aims of this study were to identify pathophysiological clusters in COPD based on an integrated set of standard lung function attributes and to investigate whether these clusters can predict patient-related outcomes and differ in clinical characteristics.Clinically stable COPD patients referred for pulmonary rehabilitation underwent an integrated assessment including clinical characteristics, dyspnea score, exercise performance, mood and health status, and lung function measurements (post-bronchodilator spirometry, body plethysmography, diffusing capacity, mouth pressures and arterial blood gases). Self-organizing maps were used to generate lung function based clusters.Clustering of lung function attributes of 518 patients with mild to very severe COPD identified seven different lung function clusters. Cluster 1 includes patients with better lung function attributes compared to the other clusters. Airflow limitation is attenuated in clusters 1 to 4 but more pronounced in clusters 5 to 7. Static hyperinflation is more dominant in clusters 5 to 7. A different pattern occurs for carbon monoxide diffusing capacity, mouth pressures and for arterial blood gases. Related to the different lung function profiles, clusters 1 and 4 demonstrate the best functional performance and health status while this is worst for clusters 6 and 7. All clusters show differences in dyspnea score, proportion of men/women, age, number of exacerbations and hospitalizations, proportion of patients using long-term oxygen and number of comorbidities.Based on an integrated assessment of lung function variables, seven pathophysiological clusters can be identified in COPD patients. These clusters poorly predict functional performance and health status."
https://openalex.org/W2891403667,"The use of physical tests to profile physical capabilities, and provide training direction to athletes is common practice. Likewise, in professional team sports, notational analysis codes the key contributions of each player during competition. Limited studies have however investigated relationships between physical capabilities and key performance indicators (KPIs) of rugby union match-play. Elite professional players, categorised as forwards (n = 15) or backs (n = 14), from an international rugby union squad (n = 29) undertook assessments of isometric mid-thigh pull (IMTP), bilateral and unilateral countermovement jumps (CMJ) and drop jumps (DJ; from 40 and 20 cm, respectively), and assessment of acceleration (10 m), a 5 m weighted sled drive, and a Yo-Yo intermittent recovery test level 1 (Yo-Yo IRTL1). Game statistics of the same players from 92 matches (~23 matches per player) during the 2014-15 season were analysed for effort and performance-based metrics. For forwards, Yo-Yo IRTL1 correlated significantly with; number of tackles made (r = 0.717), first three players at a ruck in both attack (r = 0.568) and defence (r = 0.581), number of effective rucks (r = 0.630), total possessions (r = 0.522), passes made (r = 0.651), percentage of carries over the gainline (r = 0.610), effective ruck success (r = 0.600), tackle success (r = 0.540), and the number of turnovers made (r = 0.518). Drop jump performance in forwards was associated with; the number of clean breaks (r = 0.558), dominant collisions (r = 0.589), and offloads (r = 0.594). For backs, the sled-drive test correlated with; number of carries (r = -0.751), first three players at an attacking ruck (r = -0.613), effective attacking rucks (r = -0.584), number of dominant collisions (r = -0.792) and offloads (r = -0.814). Likewise, for backs, IMTP peak force was related to; the number of possessions (r = 0.793), passes made (r = 0.792), effective attacking ruck percentage (r = 0.628), and the number of offloads (r = 0.621) whilst relative peak force correlated with; the percentage of carries over the gainline (r = 0.533), percent tackle success (r = 0.603) and effective attacking ruck percentage (r = 0.584). Regression analyses highlighted that only a small number of variables (i.e., carries, tackles, attacking and defensive first three at ruck) returned practically achievable changes (<20%) in physical qualities. In spite of this, and while leaving scope identification of further physical and/or performance predictors, greater strength, power and intermittent running performance were positively related to match-derived KPIs during competition. This may provide a basis for better integrating the strategies used by physical and technical performance-focused coaching staff to improve key performance indicators, and thus match performance, of rugby union players."

The aim of this study was to investigate the diversity held within the domesticated form, through the analysis of a major international germplasm collection of cultivated varieties, the UK National Fruit Collection, consisting of over 2,000 selections of named cultivars and seedling varieties. We utilised Diversity Array Technology (DArT) markers to assess the genetic diversity within the collection. Clustering attempts, using the software STRUCTURE revealed that the accessions formed a complex and historically admixed group for which clear clustering was challenging. Comparison of accessions using the Jaccard similarity coefficient allowed us to identify clonal and duplicate material as well as revealing pairs and groups that appeared more closely related than a standard parent-offspring or full-sibling relations. From further investigation, we were able to propose a number of new pedigrees, which revealed that some historically important cultivars were more closely related than previously documented and that some of them were partially inbred. We were also able to elucidate a number of parent-offspring relationships that had resulted in a number of important polyploid cultivars. This included reuniting polyploid cultivars that in some cases dated as far back as the 18th century, with diploid parents that potentially date back as far as the 13th century."

We proposed a new method for Amazonian species based on hybridization capture of the COI gene DNA from a distant species (Danio rerio), absent from our study area (the Amazon basin). The COI sequence of this species is approximately equidistant from all COI of Amazonian species available. By using this sequence as probe we successfully facilitated the simultaneous identification of fish larvae belonging to the order Siluriformes and to the Characiformes represented in our ichthyoplankton samples. Species relative frequencies, estimated by the number of reads, showed almost perfect correlations with true frequencies estimated by a Sanger approach, allowing the development of a quantitative approach. We also proposed a further improvement to a previous protocol, which enables lowering the sequencing effort by 40 times. This new Metabarcoding by Capture using a Single Probe (MCSP) methodology could have important implications for ecology, fisheries management and conservation in fish biodiversity hotspots worldwide. Our approach could easily be extended to other plant and animal taxa."

Borneo is a region of extremely high biodiversity from which forest is being lost faster than in any other. The little-known Sunda clouded leopard (Neofelis diardi) is the top predator in Borneo and is likely to depend critically on habitat connectivity that is currently being rapidly lost to deforestation. We modeled the effects of landscape fragmentation on population size, genetic diversity and population connectivity for the Sunda clouded leopard across the entirety of Borneo. We modelled the impacts of land use change between the years 2000, 2010 and projected forwards to 2020. We found substantial reductions across all metrics between 2000 and 2010: the proportion of landscape connected by dispersal fell by approximately 12.5% and the largest patch size declined by around 15.1%, leading to a predicted 11.4% decline in clouded leopard numbers. We also predict that these trends will accelerate greatly towards 2020, with the percentage of the landscape being connected by dispersal falling by about 57.8%, the largest patch size falling by around 62.8% and the predicted clouded leopard population falling by 62.5% between 2010 and 2020. We predicted that these large declines in clouded leopard population size and connectivity will also substantially reduce the genetic diversity of the remaining clouded leopard population."

The itineraries and immune cell interactions of tumor microvesicles during the intravascular and extravascular stages of metastasis are largely unknown. We found that the lipid receptor CD36 is a major mediator of the engulfment of pancreatic tumor microvesicles by myeloid immune cells in vitro and critically samples circulating tumor microvesicles by resident liver macrophages in mice in vivo. Direct nanoscopic imaging of individual tumor microvesicles shows that the microvesicles rapidly decay during engulfment whereby their cargo is targeted concomitantly to the plasma membrane and the cytoplasm excluding lysosomal compartments. CD36 also promotes internalization of blood cell (nontumor) microvesicles, which involves endolysosomal pathways. A portion of tumor microvesicles circulating in the liver microcirculation traverses the vessel wall in a CD36-dependent way. Extravasated microvesicles colonize distinct perivascular Ly6C− macrophages for at least 2 wk. Thus, the microvesicles are increasingly integrated into CD36-induced premetastatic cell clusters and enhance development of liver metastasis. Hence, promotion of metastasis by pancreatic tumor microvesicles is associated with CD36-regulated immune cell invasion and extravasation of microvesicles and persistent infiltration of specific tissue macrophages by microvesicle cargo.—Pfeiler, S., Thakur, M., Grünauer, P., Megens, R.

There are currently no vaccines available to prevent RSV infections, and disease management is largely limited to supportive care, making the identification and development of effective antiviral therapeutics against RSV a priority. To identify effective chemical scaffolds for managing RSV disease, we conducted a high-throughput anti-RSV screen of a 57,000-compound library. We identified a hit compound that specifically blocked activity of the RSV RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) complex, initially with moderate low-micromolar potency. Mechanistic characterization in an in vitro RSV RdRp assay indicated that representatives of this compound class block elongation of RSV RNA products after initial extension by up to three nucleotides. Synthetic hit-to-lead exploration yielded an informative 3D quantitative structure–activity relationship (3D-QSAR) model and resulted in analogs with more than 20-fold improved potency and selectivity indices (SIs) of >1,000. However, first-generation leads exhibited limited water solubility and poor metabolic stability. A second optimization strategy informed by the 3D-QSAR model combined with in silico pharmacokinetics (PK) predictions yielded an advanced lead, AVG-233, that demonstrated nanomolar activity against both laboratory-adapted RSV strains and clinical RSV isolates. This anti-RSV activity extended to infection of established cell lines and primary human airway cells. PK profiling in mice revealed 34% oral bioavailability of AVG-233 and sustained high drug levels in the circulation after a single oral dose of 20 mg/kg. This promising first-in-class lead warrants further development as an anti-RSV drug."

Phylogenetically, the strains were most closely related to Cystobasidium slooffiae, based on the sequences of the ITS regions and the D1/D2 domain of the LSU rRNA gene. The strains were oleaginous, accumulating lipids to levels > 20% dry cell weight. Moreover, kinetic analysis of the sugar-to-lipid conversion of a 1:1 glucose/xylose mixture showed that the strains consumed the two sugars simultaneously. IPM46-17 attained the highest lipid content (33%), mostly C16 and C18 fatty acids. Thus, the yeasts efficiently converted lignocellulosic sugars to lipids, aiding in biofuel production (which benefits the environment, promotes rural jobs, and strengthens fuel security). The strains constituted a novel species of Cystobasidium, for which we propose the name Cystobasidium iriomotense (type strain ISM28-8sT = JCM 24594T = CBS 15015T)."

Methods In late 2017, we surveyed members of the American Public Health Association Applied Public Health Statistics section and others; 247 of 278 who screened eligible answered the survey, and 209 answered every applicable question. The survey included questions about file management, code annotation and documentation, reproducibility of analyses, and facilitators and barriers of using reproducible practices. Results Just 14.4% of participants had shared code, data, or both. Many participants reported their data (33%) and code (43.2%) would be difficult for colleagues to find if they left their institution. Top reported barriers to using reproducible practices were data privacy (49.8%) and lack of time (41.7%). Participants suggested training (50.9%) and requirements by journals (44.4%) and funders (40.2%) to increase use of reproducible research practices.

https://openalex.org/W2892223484,"Introduction Posterior tibial slope (PTS) and sagittal alignment are important factors in the etiology of knee osteoarthritis and knee surgery. Clinically, sagittal alignment, which indicates flexion contracture of the knee, contributes to knee function in weight-bearing (WB) conditions. PTS and sagittal alignment under WB conditions in varus osteoarthritic knees are presumed to affect each other, but their association remains unclear. In this study, we aimed to clarify the association. Material and methods In total, 140 osteoarthritic varus knees were investigated. Under WB conditions, a three-dimensional (3D) alignment assessment system was applied via biplanar long-leg X-rays, using 3D-to-2D image registration technique. The evaluation parameters were as follows: 1) 3D mechanical flexion angle (3DMFA) in regards to sagittal alignment, 2) passing point in the WB line (PP), and 3) medial and lateral PTS. Results The medial and lateral PTS showed a positive correlation with 3DMFA and PP, respectively (medial PTS–3DMFA, p = 0.001; medial PTS–PP, p < 0.0001; lateral PTS–3DMFA, p < 0.0001; lateral PTS–PP, p = 0.002). The flexion contracture group with 3DMFA >5° demonstrated greater PTS than non-flexion contracture group (medial PTS, p = 0.006; lateral PTS, p = 0.006). Conclusions Both medial and lateral PTS were correlated with sagittal alignment under WB conditions and were larger in the flexion contracture group. This finding can explain the function to take the load articular surface parallel to the ground for holding the balance in WB conditions in the sagittal plane for osteoarthritic knees. Moreover, surgeons may be required to decrease the PTS during knee arthroplasty to restore full extension in knees of patients with fixed flexion contracture."

Bioerosion (i.e. biodegradation of substrate) and encrustation (i.e. calcified overgrowth on substrate) influence the carbonate budget and the ecological functions of coral reefs, by substrate formation/consolidation/erosion, food availability and nutrient cycling. This study investigates settlement succession and carbonate budget change by bioeroding and encrusting calcifying organisms on experimentally deployed coral substrates (skeletal fragments of Stylophora pistillata branches). The substrates were deployed in a marginal coral reef located in the Gulf of Papagayo (Costa Rica, Eastern Tropical Pacific) for four months during the northern winter upwelling period (December 2013 to March 2014), and consecutively sampled after each month. Due to the upwelling environmental conditions within the Eastern Tropical Pacific, this region serves as a natural laboratory to study ecological processes such as bioerosion, which may reflect climate change scenarios. Time-series analyses showed a rapid settlement of bioeroders, particularly of lithophagine bivalves of the genus Lithophaga/Leiosolenus (Dillwyn, 1817), within the first two months of exposure. The observed enhanced calcium carbonate loss of coral substrate (>30%) may influence seawater carbon chemistry. This is evident by measurements of an elevated seawater pH (>8.2) and aragonite saturation state (Ωarag >3) at Matapalo Reef during the upwelling period, when compared to a previous upwelling event observed at a nearby site in distance to a coral reef (Marina Papagayo). Due to the resulting local carbonate buffer effect of the seawater, an influx of atmospheric CO2 into reef waters was observed. Substrates showed no secondary cements in thin-section analyses, despite constant seawater carbonate oversaturation (Ωarag >2.8) during the field experiment. Micro Computerized Tomography (μCT) scans and microcast-embeddings of the substrates revealed that the carbonate loss was primarily due to internal macrobioerosion and an increase in microbioerosion. This study emphasizes the interconnected effects of upwelling and carbonate bioerosion on the reef carbonate budget and the ecological turnovers of carbonate producers in tropical coral reefs under environmental change."
https://openalex.org/W2889897724,"In order to study the linkages between straw decomposition rate and the change in soil biological properties after straw addition to different fertilized soils, we collected soils from three long-term fertilization treatments (no-fertilizer, CK; nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium fertilizers, NPK; NPK plus straw (S), NPKS), and incubated maize straw with these soils at 25°C for 75 days. The average straw carbon dioxide (CO2) emission rate in the CK+straw (S), NPK+S, and NPKS+S treatments was 0.58±0.51, 0.66±0.53, and 0.74±0.58 μg C g−1soil h−1, respectively. The average increase in the contents of fungi, bacteria, and Actinomycetes under straw addition treatments than the control soils (CK, NPK, and NPKS, respectively) changed in the order of CK+S≤NPK+S <NPKS+S, while bacteria and Actinomycetes peaked later in the CK+SthanNPK+S and NPKS+S treatments. Bacterial abundance unchanged, Actinomycetes abundance decreased, but fungal abundance significantly increased in soils after straw addition. The average increase in the activities of β-glucosidase (BG), β-D-cellobiosidase (CB), and β-xylosidase (XYL) differed as: CK+S<NPK+S ≤ NPKS+S, and the highest activities and increments of them occurred later in the CK+S than NPK+S and NPKS+S treatments. Straw CO2 emission rate was poorly correlated with changes in the contents of microbial fractions across all straw addition treatments, but it was significant positively correlated with the increased activities of BG, CB, and XYL under the NPK+S and NPKS+S treatments. Our results indicated that chemical fertilization and straw return soils differently increased straw decomposition because of the different increases in microbial fractions and soil enzyme activities when compared to the no-fertilizer soil, and the decomposition process was more closely correlated with C-obtaining enzymes than microbial fractions."
https://openalex.org/W2891261398,"Free fatty acid is considered to be one of the major pathogenic factors of inducing insulin resistance. The association between iron disturbances and insulin resistance has recently begun to receive a lot of attention. Although skeletal muscles are a major tissue for iron utilization and storage, the role of iron in palmitate (PA)-induced insulin resistance is unknown. We investigated the molecular mechanism underlying iron dysregulation in PA-induced insulin resistance. Interestingly, we found that PA simultaneously increased intracellular iron and induced insulin resistance. The iron chelator deferoxamine dramatically inhibited PA-induced insulin resistance, and iron donors impaired insulin sensitivity by activating JNK. PA up-regulated transferrin receptor 1 (tfR1), an iron uptake protein, which was modulated by iron-responsive element-binding proteins 2. Knockdown of tfR1 and iron-responsive element-binding proteins 2 prevented PA-induced iron uptake and insulin resistance. PA also translocated the tfR1 by stimulating calcium influx, but the calcium chelator, BAPTA-AM, dramatically reduced iron overload by inhibiting tfR1 translocation and ultimately increased insulin sensitivity. Iron overload may play a critical role in PA-induced insulin resistance. Blocking iron overload may thus be a useful strategy for preventing insulin resistance and diabetes.—Cui, R., Choi, S.-E., Kim, T. H., Lee, H. J., Lee, S. J., Kang, Y., Jeon, J. Y., Kim, H.

https://openalex.org/W2892240554,"From Moctezuma’s zoo to animals kept in captivity at Teotihuacan, there is increasing evidence that Mesoamericans managed wild animals for a myriad of purposes. The present study situates ritualized animal management of highly symbolic fauna in the broader context of Classic Mesoamerica by examining another core site, the Maya center of Copan, Honduras (A.D. 426–822). In this study, we identify two animal populations among the faunal remains from public and private rituals spanning the Copan dynasty. One population, with diets heavily composed of atypically sourced C4 inputs indicative of artificial feeding, corresponds with the felids interred in Altar Q and Motmot caches. The second population is composed of felids and felid products bearing a predominance of C3 signatures indicative of a more natural dietary regime. As with Copan deer, species-specific δ18O variations within these felid populations further substantiates the postulation that an expansive faunal trade network operated throughout the greater Copan Valley and beyond. Animals routed from sites of capture into the mesh of this network would have been processed into pelts, venison and other secondary goods or delivered alive to centers of state power for ritual usage and display. Our data reveal that at Copan, wild animals were routinely brought into intimate contact with human settlements to be managed and physically manipulated in a variety of ways in order to fulfill ritual and symbolic purposes."
https://openalex.org/W2889723470,"The conservation of biodiverse areas around the world has contributed to the protection and recovery of endangered species. This has been the case for 11 species of Galapagos giant tortoises (Chelonoidis spp.) that today are successfully maintained over six islands: Española, Santiago, Pinzon, Isabela, San Cristobal and Santa Cruz. A favourable state of conservation will depend however on future development in the islands. In Santa Cruz Island the development of the agricultural areas has encroached on the migratory routes of the southwestern species C. porteri and may be an emergent conflict for tortoise conservation. We investigated the social and ecological inter-linkages using two methods framed under a participatory rural appraisal (PRA) approach: semi-structured interviews and questionnaires to study farmers’ perceptions and attitudinal factors regarding giant tortoises; as well as the associated socio-economic impacts of the conflict. Moreover, we coupled the PRA approach with an ecological assessment of giant tortoises’ population density by performing transect counts during the two yearly phases of giant tortoises’ migration to the lowlands (January to June) and back to the highlands (July to December). Our results indicate that farmers reporting damage and cultivating crops have higher odds of taking actions (fencing and physical actions) towards giant tortoises; regardless of having (or not) a negative perception towards the species. The economic losses for crops and fences averaged 2.8 USD/m2 and 13USD/m, respectively, and provide an initial step to further analyse and characterise the direct and indirect damage costs. Finally, we estimated a density of 76 and 185 individuals of giant tortoises per km2 in the rural area for the lowland and highland migratory phases, respectively. Our approach provides grounded scientific social and ecological information to effectively inform and aid managers, policy and decision makers in the selection of adequate social and ecological criteria to implement the best available options in the resolution of this emergent conservation conflict."
https://openalex.org/W2891124900,"With varied, brightly patterned wings, butterflies have been the focus of much work on the evolution and development of phenotypic novelty. However, the chemical structures of wing pigments from few butterfly species have been identified. We characterized the orange wing pigments of female Elymnias hypermnestra butterflies (Lepidoptera: Nymphalidae: Satyrinae) from two Southeast Asian populations. This species is a sexually dimorphic Batesian mimic of several model species. Females are polymorphic: in some populations, females are dark, resemble conspecific males, and mimic Euploea spp. In other populations, females differ from males and mimic orange Danaus spp. Using LC-MS/MS, we identified nine ommochrome pigments: six from a population in Chiang Mai, Thailand, and five compounds from a population in Bali, Indonesia. Two ommochromes were found in both populations, and only two of the nine compounds have been previously reported. The sexually dimorphic Thai and Balinese populations are separated spatially by monomorphic populations in peninsular Malaysia, Singapore, and Sumatra, suggesting independent evolution of mimetic female wing pigments in these disjunct populations. These results indicate that other butterfly wing pigments remain to be discovered."
https://openalex.org/W2890837174,"Increasing concern is directed towards genetic diversity of domestic animal populations because strong selective breeding can rapidly deplete genetic diversity of socio-economically valuable animals. International conservation policy identifies minimizing genetic erosion of domesticated animals as a key biodiversity target. We used breeding records to assess potential indications of inbreeding and loss of founder allelic diversity in 12 native Swedish dog breeds, traditional to the country, ten of which have been identified by authorities as of conservation concern. The pedigrees dated back to the mid-1900, comprising 5-11 generations and 350-66,500 individuals per pedigree. We assessed rates of inbreeding and potential indications of loss of genetic variation by measuring inbreeding coefficients and remaining number of founder alleles at five points in time during 1980-2012. We found average inbreeding coefficients among breeds to double-from an average of 0.03 in 1980 to 0.07 in 2012 -in spite of the majority of breeds being numerically large with pedigrees comprising thousands of individuals indicating that such rapid increase of inbreeding should have been possible to avoid. We also found indications of extensive loss of intra-breed variation; on average 70 percent of founder alleles are lost during 1980-2012. Explicit conservation goals for these breeds were not reflected in pedigree based conservation genetic measures; breeding needs to focus more on retaining genetic variation, and supplementary genomic analyses of these breeds are highly warranted in order to find out the extent to which the trends indicated here are reflected over the genomes of these breeds."
https://openalex.org/W2886445102,"Traditional economic interpretations have not been successful in explaining differences in saving rates across countries. One hypothesis is that savings respond to cultural specific social norms. The accepted view in economics so far is that culture does not have any effect on savings. We revisit this evidence using a novel dataset, which allows us to study the saving behavior of up to three generations of immigrants in the United Kingdom. Against the backdrop of existing evidence, we find that cultural preferences are an important explanation for cross-country differences in saving behavior, and their relevance persists up to three generations."

In contrast to recent publications our model quantifies the impact of each single suggestion not only for an individual study but especially their relation and consequences for the overall scientific process. We can prove that higher-powered experiments can save resources in the overall research process without generating excess false positives. The better the quality of the pre-study information and its exploitation, the more likely this beneficial effect is to occur. Additionally, we quantify the adverse effects of both neglecting good practices in the design and conduct of hypotheses-based research, and the omission of the publication of 'negative' findings. Our contribution is a plea for adherence to or reinforcement of the good scientific practice and publication of 'negative' findings."
https://openalex.org/W2890182373,"The bottlenose dolphin, genus Tursiops is one of the best studied of all the Cetacea with a minimum of two species widely recognised. Common bottlenose dolphins (T. truncatus), are the cetacean species most frequently held in captivity and are known to hybridize with species from at least 6 different genera. In this study, we document several intra-generic hybridization events between T. truncatus and T. aduncus held in captivity. We demonstrate that the F1 hybrids are fertile and can backcross producing apparently healthy offspring, thereby showing introgressive inter-specific hybridization within the genus. We document that female F1 hybrids can reach sexual maturity at 4 yr and 3 mo of age, and can become pregnant and give birth before being fully weaned. The information presented has implications for understanding hybrid reticulation among cetacean species and practical implications for captive facilities housing either Tursiops species or hybrids thereof."
https://openalex.org/W2890889106,"Currently, separate measures are used to estimate the impact of animal diseases on mortality and animal welfare. This article introduces a novel metric, the Welfare-Adjusted Life Year (WALY), to estimate disease impact by combining welfare compromise and premature death components. Adapting the Disability-Adjusted Life Year approach used in human health audits, we propose WALY as the sum of a) the years lived with impaired welfare due to a particular cause and b) the years of life lost due to the premature death from the same cause. The years lived with impaired welfare are the product of the average duration of each welfare impediment, reflecting the actual condition that compromises animal welfare, the probability of an incident case developing and impaired welfare weights, representing the degree of impaired welfare. The years of life lost are calculated using the standard expected lifespan at the time of premature death. To demonstrate the concept, we estimated WALYs for 10 common canine diseases, namely mitral valve disease, dilated cardiomyopathy, chronic kidney disease, diabetes mellitus, atopic dermatitis, splenic haemangiosarcoma, appendicular osteosarcoma, cranial cruciate ligament disease, thoracolumbar intervertebral disc disease and cervical spondylomyelopathy. A survey of veterinarians (n = 61) was conducted to elicit impaired welfare weights for 35 welfare impediments. Paired comparison was the primary method to elicit weights, whereas visual analogue scale and time trade-off approaches rescaled these weights onto the desired scale, from 0 (the optimal welfare imaginable) to 1 (the worst welfare imaginable). WALYs for the 10 diseases were then estimated using the impaired welfare weights and published epidemiological data on disease impacts. Welfare impediment ""amputation: one limb"" and ""respiratory distress"" had the lowest and highest impaired welfare weights at 0.134 and 0.796, rescaled with a visual analogue scale, and 0.117 and 0.857, rescaled with time trade-off. Among the 10 diseases, thoracolumbar intervertebral disc disease and atopic dermatitis had the smallest and greatest adverse impact on dogs with WALYs at 2.83 (95% UI: 1.54-3.94) and 9.73 (95% uncertainty interval [UI]: 7.17-11.8), respectively. This study developed the WALY metric and demonstrated that it summarises welfare compromise as perceived by humans and total impact of diseases in individual animals. The WALY can potentially be used for prioritisation of disease eradication and control programs, quantification of population welfare and longitudinal surveillance of animal welfare in companion animals and may possibly be extended to production animals."
https://openalex.org/W2891275386,"The regulation of cytochrome P450 activity is often achieved by structural transitions induced by substrate binding. We describe the conformational transition experienced upon binding by the P450 OleP, an epoxygenase involved in oleandomycin biosynthesis. OleP bound to the substrate analog 6DEB crystallized in 2 forms: one with an ensemble of open and closed conformations in the asymmetric unit and another with only the closed conformation. Characterization of O1eP-6DEB binding kinetics, also using the P450 inhibitor clotrimazole, unveiled a complex binding mechanism that involves slow conformational rearrangement with the accumulation of a spectroscopically detectable intermediate where 6DEB is bound to open OleP.

https://openalex.org/W2891668800,"In order to help predict the effects of anthropogenic stressors on shallow water carbonate environments, it is important to focus research on regions containing natural oceanographic gradients, particularly with respect to interactions between oceanography and ecologically sensitive carbonate producers. The Galápagos Archipelago, an island chain in the eastern equatorial Pacific, spans a natural nutrient, pH, and temperature gradient due to the interaction of several major ocean currents. Further, the region is heavily impacted by the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and the Galápagos exhibited widespread coral bleaching and degradation following the strong ENSO events of 1982-1983 and 1997-1998. These findings are coupled with reports of unusually low abundances of time-averaged benthic foraminiferal assemblages throughout the region. Foraminifera, shelled single-celled protists, are sensitive to environmental change and rapidly respond to alterations to their surrounding environment, making them ideal indicator species for the study of reef water quality and health. Here, statistical models and analyses were used to compare modern shallow water benthic foraminiferal assemblages from 19 samples spanning the Galápagos Archipelago to predominant oceanographic parameters at each collection site. Fisher α diversity indices, Ternary diagrams, Canonical Correspondence Analysis, regression tree analysis and FORAM-Index (FI; a single metric index for evaluating water quality associated with reef development) implied a combined impact from ENSO and upwelling from Equatorial Undercurrent (EUC) waters to primarily impact foraminiferal abundances and drive assemblage patterns throughout the archipelago. For instance, repeated ENSO temperature anomalies might be responsible for low foraminiferal density, while chronically high nutrients and low aragonite saturation and low pH-induced by EUC upwelling and La Niña anomalies-likely inhibited post-ENSO recovery, and caused foraminiferal assemblages to exhibit a heterotrophic dominance in the southern archipelago. What resulted are low FI values in the southern collection sites, indicating environments not conducive to endosymbiont development and/or recovery."

The results showed that in the last 140,000 years, species of the family Ceratophryidae expanded and contracted their distribution areas, which naturally reflected the climate and vegetation changes in the Quaternary of South America. The maps of projections showed that changes in temperature determined the area of habitat suitability of 63.7% of the species of ceratophrids both during the last interglacial period and nowadays, and it seems that this will also be the case for the next 62 years. Given the current concerns about future extinctions in the tropics, it is prudent to examine, with special attention, the effects of climate fluctuations on the diversity and distribution of species, because the current estimates of reduction in biodiversity caused by habitat destruction and emission of greenhouse gases are comparable to estimated reductions during glacial intervals."

However, several lines of evidence suggest that ADaM sites are dynamic in solution and can adopt a number of different conformational states. First, the ADaM site ligand pocket is adaptable and its shape and size is modulated by ligand binding. For instance, we have calculated a pocket size of 486.5 Å3 for AMPK α2β1γ1 bound to 991 (PDB 4CFE); pocket sizes of 374.5 Å3 and 474.9 Å3, respectively, for AMPK α1β1γ1 bound to the A769662 derivatives Cl-A769662 (PDB 4QFR) and Br2-A769662 (PDB 4QFS); pocket sizes of 547.1 Å3 and 522.7 Å3, respectively, for AMPK α1β1γ1 bound to the 991 derivatives R734 and R739; 4Y. Yan, X. E. Zhou, H. E. Xu, and K. Melcher, unpublished data. and pocket sizes of 195.0 and 396.1 Å3, respectively, for apo-AMPK α1β1γ1 (PDB 4QFG) and apo-AMPK α1β2γ1 (PDB 4RER). Second, the first identified ADaM site agonist, the thienopyridone A769662, only activates β1-subunit containing complexes, requires phosphorylation of Ser-108 of the CBM, and can synergize with AMP to fully activate AMPK even in the absence of AMPK activation loop phosphorylation (27Scott J.W. van Denderen B.J.

In contrast, the cyclic benzimidazole 991 also activates β2-containing AMPK complexes (albeit less potently than β1-containing AMPK), does not absolutely require CBM phosphorylation for agonist activity, and in combination with AMP fails to fully overcome the requirement for activation loop phosphorylation (16Xiao B.

Third, a 991-derivative AMPK activator, R739, selectively and robustly increases protection of the activation loop of β2-containing AMPK against dephosphorylation without increasing direct allosteric AMPK activation.4 Fourth, the A769662 derivative MT47-100 is an agonist of β1-containing complexes, but an inhibitor of β2-containing complexes (30Scott J.W.

Fifth, the ADaM site-forming KD–CBM interaction is destabilized by glycogen, which binds the CBM distal to the ADaM site, and is stabilized by CBM phosphorylation (13Li X. Wang L. Zhou X.E. Ke J. de Waal P.W. Gu X. Tan M.H. Wang D. Wu D. Xu H.E. Melcher K.

Collectively, this indicates that ADaM site modulation through AMPK ligands is highly complex and likely proceeds through adoption of different ensembles of conformations in solution. Full understanding of AMPK regulation through ADaM site modulation therefore requires elucidation of the conformational landscapes of the ADaM site in different AMPK activity states. To gain detailed insight into ADaM site conformational states and their differential stabilization, we site-specifically introduced pairs of nitroxide spin labels into AMPK to determine the distributions of distances between their electron spins by DEER spectroscopy. In contrast to continuous wave electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) methods, which measure short distances between spin pairs (5–25 Å) via spectral line broadening, DEER provides interspin distance distributions in the 18–80-Å range with high accuracy by analysis of an acquired dipolar evolution trace (31Altenbach C.

Dead-time free measurement of dipole-dipole interactions between electron spins.J. Magn. Reson. 2000; 142 (10648151): 331-34010.1006/jmre.1999.1944Crossref PubMed Scopus (808) Google Scholar). This dipolar evolution function is analyzed to yield interspin distance information by way of background signal subtraction and Pake transform. The extent to which the position and width of peaks in a DEER distance distribution are reliably determined depends, among other things, on the data collection time (32Jeschke G. DEER distance measurements on proteins.Annu. Rev. Phys. Chem. 2012; 63 (22404592): 419-44610.1146/annurev-physchem-032511-143716Crossref PubMed Scopus (727) Google Scholar), where the most reliable fits are those where at least one full dipolar oscillation is visible in, and thus fittable from, the trace. Regarding the data presented under “Results”: for distances between 20 and 45 Å both the position and width of DEER peaks are reliable (the boundary of which is indicated by a red mark on the x-axis of distance distribution plots, see, e.g. Fig. 2A); between 45 and 60 Å, the position, but not the width of peaks is reliable (this region is bounded by a green mark on the x-axis), whereas at distances greater than 60 Å, the presence of interacting spin populations are indicated, but neither their position nor width is reliable. Because different protein preparations have variations in activity and labeling efficiency, Fig. S1 visualizes the level of spectral reproducibility from two pairs of independent protein preparations. The amplitude of the dipolar evolution function, the “depth of modulation” (DoM), can be used to estimate the fraction of spins involved in discrete pairwise interactions within the distance range of the method (32Jeschke G. DEER distance measurements on proteins.Annu. Rev. Phys. Chem. 2012; 63 (22404592): 419-44610.1146/annurev-physchem-032511-143716Crossref PubMed Scopus (727) Google Scholar), thus providing a means to detect partial dissociation of a region bearing the labels. For example, if a domain bearing one label partially dissociates from the rest of the protein, thus moving the interspin distance outside of the detectable DEER range (≥80 Å), the DoM will decrease in proportion to the fraction dissociated. Although other biophysical techniques such as FRET or hydrogen deuterium exchange (HDX) provide insight on averaged conformational states, DEER identifies distinct conformational states and their fractional occupancies. Using this experimental approach, we demonstrate that the ADaM site is only partially formed and highly heterogeneous in the apo-state, induced and greatly stabilized by ADaM site agonists, and modulated by phosphorylation. To site-specifically introduce DEER spin labels into the AMPK holo-complex, we first mutated the 13 exposed cysteines in AMPK (Table S1). This allowed us to chemically introduce nitroxide spin labels either into endogenous, exposed cysteines that we selectively excluded from mutation or into cysteines introduced at selected positions by site-directed mutagenesis. Given the pharmacological interest in the ADaM site of β2-containing AMPK (21Hardie D.G. Targeting an energy sensor to treat diabetes.Science. 2017; 357 (28774917): 455-45610.1126/science.aao1913Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), we selected the α1(11–550)–β2(76–272)–γ1(24–327) complex, at the time the only β2-containing holo-AMPK complex of known structure (PDB 4RER) (13Li X.

We further introduced a maltose-binding protein (MBP) tag at the N terminus of the α1-subunit, which we have found to increase stability and solubility of the complex. This “Cys-free” AMPK assembles normally and stochiometrically and is, as WT AMPK, phosphorylated by the AMPK upstream kinase CaMKKβ at its α- and β-subunits (Figs. S2A and S3, A and B). It has been reported that AMPK with α2 C130A and C174A mutations cannot be activated by energy stress in cells or in vitro (34Shao D. Oka S. Liu T. Zhai P. Ago T. Sciarretta S. Li H. Sadoshima J.

However, Cys-free MBP-α1β2γ1 AMPK, in which the corresponding α1 residues Cys-132 and Cys-176 are mutated to Ala and Ser, respectively, is clearly activated by AMP (although it has reduced catalytic activity). This protein is also activated by the ADaM site ligand 991, and not by the β1-specific A769662 (Fig. S2B), a very similar behavior to that of WT AMPK (16Xiao B. Sanders M.J. Carmena D. Bright N.J.

The catalytic center of protein kinases is located in a substrate-binding cleft between the kinase N- and C-lobes. The two lobes are connected by a flexible hinge that allows the two lobes to move relative to each other to adopt two alternative ensembles of conformations: open conformations in the absence of bound substrate and closed conformations, indicative of substrate-bound, active kinases (36Kornev A.P.

In this study, we focused on the interspin distances between one nitroxide spin label introduced into a solvent-exposed site (K88C) in the CBM and a second introduced into one of three distinct sites of the kinase domain (KD) C-lobe (Cys-132, Cys-211, and F225C; Fig. 1, and Figs.

Geographic variation in gastric cancer risk has been attributed to variation in carriage and type of the H. pylori oncogene cagA. Colonization density may also influence disease and cagA has been associated with higher shedding in stool. However, the relationship between H. pylori load in the stool and in the stomach is not clear. Methods To investigate possible differences in H. pylori load in the stomach and shedding in stool, H. pylori load and cagA genotype were assessed using droplet digital PCR assays on gastric mucosa and stool samples from 49 urea breath test-positive individuals, including 25 gastric cancer and 24 non-cancer subjects at Henan Cancer Hospital, Henan, China. Results Quantitation of H. pylori DNA indicated similar gastric loads among cancer and non-cancer cases, but the gastric cancer group had a median H. pylori load in the stool that was six times higher than that of the non-cancer subjects. While the cagA gene was uniformly present among study subjects, only 70% had the East Asian cagA allele, which was significantly associated with gastric cancer (Fisher’s Exact Test, p = 0.03). Conclusion H. pylori persists in a subset of gastric cancer cases and thus may contribute to cancer progression. In this East Asian population with a high prevalence of the cagA gene, the East Asian allele could still provide a marker for gastric cancer risk. Impact This study contributes to our understanding of H. pylori dynamics in the context of pathological changes."
https://openalex.org/W2978413428,"Many Service members and Veterans with lower-limb amputations have the potential for high function and the desire to resume physically demanding occupations that require them to carry heavy loads (e.g., military service, firefighters, farmers, ranchers, construction workers). However, it is currently unclear which prosthetic feet best accommodate heavy load carriage while also providing good overall function and mobility during unweighted activities. The main objective of this study was to investigate the ability of currently available prosthetic ankle-foot systems to accommodate weighted walking by examining the mechanical characteristics (i.e., forefoot stiffness) and dynamic function (i.e., rocker radius, effective foot length ratio, and late-stance energy return) of prosthetic feet designed for high activity users. Load versus deflection curves were obtained for nine prosthetic ankle-foot systems using a servohydraulic test frame and load cell. Effective roll-over shape characteristics and late-stance energy return measures were then obtained using quantitative gait analysis for three users with unilateral, transtibial amputation. Results from mechanical and dynamic testing showed that although forefoot stiffness varied across the nine feet investigated in this study, changes measured in roll-over shape radius and effective foot length ratio were relatively small in response to weighted walking. At the same time, prosthetic feet with more compliant forefoot keel structures appeared to provide more late-stance energy return compared to feet with stiffer forefoot keel structures. These results suggest that prosthetic ankle-foot systems with compliant forefoot keel structures may better accommodate weighted walking by reducing the metabolic cost of physically demanding activities. However, to more fully understand the biomechanical and functional implications of these results, other factors, such as the residual-limb strength of the user and the overall stiffness profile of the prosthetic foot, should also be considered."

Current standard of care includes biologics that target vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), a key mediator of neovascularization. While anti-VGEF therapies have been successful, up to 30% of patients are non-responsive. Therefore, there is a need for new therapeutic targets, and small molecule inhibitors of angiogenesis to complement existing treatments. Apelin and its receptor have recently been shown to play a key role in both developmental and pathological angiogenesis in the eye. Through a cell-based high-throughput screen, we identified 4-aminoquinoline antimalarial drugs as potent selective antagonists of APJ. The prototypical 4-aminoquinoline, amodiaquine was found to be a selective, non-competitive APJ antagonist that inhibited apelin signaling in a concentration-dependent manner. Additionally, amodiaquine suppressed both apelin-and VGEF-induced endothelial tube formation. Intravitreal amodaiquine significantly reduced choroidal neovascularization (CNV) lesion volume in the laser-induced CNV mouse model, and showed no signs of ocular toxicity at the highest doses tested. This work firmly establishes APJ as a novel, chemically tractable therapeutic target for the treatment of ocular neovascularization, and that amodiaquine is a potential candidate for repurposing and further toxicological, and pharmacokinetic evaluation in the clinic."
https://openalex.org/W2950558053,"Survival of junior scientists in academic biomedical research is difficult in today's highly competitive funding climate. National Institute of Health (NIH) data on first-time R01 grantees indicate the rate at which early investigators drop out from a NIH-supported research career is most rapid 4 to 5 years from the first R01 award. The factors associated with a high risk of dropping out, and whether these factors impact all junior investigators equally, are unclear. We identified a cohort of 1,496 investigators who received their first R01-equivalent (R01-e) awards from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases between 2003 and 2010, and studied all their subsequent NIH grant applications through 2016. Ultimately, 57% of the cohort were successful in obtaining new R01-e funding, despite highly competitive conditions. Among those investigators who failed to compete successfully for new funding (43%), the average time to dropping out was 5 years. Investigators who successfully obtained new grants showed remarkable within-person consistency across multiple grant submission behaviors, including submitting more applications per year, more renewal applications, and more applications to multiple NIH Institutes. Funded investigators appeared to have two advantages over their unfunded peers at the outset: they had better scores on their first R01-e grants and they demonstrated an early ability to write applications that would be scored, not triaged. The cohort rapidly segregated into two very different groups on the basis of PI consistency in the quality and frequency of applications submitted after their first R01-e award. Lastly, we identified a number of specific demographic factors, intitutional characteristics, and grant submission behaviors that were associated with successful outcomes, and assessed their predictive value and relative importance for the likelihood of obtaining additional NIH funding."
https://openalex.org/W2890048182,"IWS1 is an RNA-polymerase II (RNAPII)-associated transcription elongation factor whose biological functions are poorly characterized. To shed some light on the function of this protein at the organismal level, we performed a systematic tissue analysis of its expression and generated Iws1-deficient mice. A thorough immunohistochemical characterization shows that IWS1 protein is present in the nucleus of all cells in most of the examined tissues, with few notable exceptions. We also report that ablation of Iws1 consistently causes lethality at the pre-implantation stage with high expression of the gene in fertilized oocytes. In summary, we are providing evidence that Iws1 is expressed in all adult organs and it is an essential gene for mouse embryonic development."
https://openalex.org/W2890752454,"Background In pregnant women, the use of Mycophenolic acid (MPA) is associated with teratogenicity. Recently, the European Medicines Agency (EMEA) and the Spanish Agency of Medicine and Sanitary Products (AEMPS) warned about the potential teratogenic effects of MPA. These adverse events may occur even in children from males on treatment with MPA. However, evidence of malformations in offsprings of male kidney transplanted patients (KT) exposed to MPA is limited. Thus, the present study aimed to evaluate the incidence of offspring malformations in children of renal transplanted males under MPA. Materials and methods We conducted a retrospective study in which we evaluated the incidence of malformations in descendants from male recipients that were exposed or not to MPA before and at the time of conception. Two groups of patients were evaluated. Those exposed to MPA (MPA group, n = 20) and the non-MPA group (n = 13) that included patients that did not receive AZA (n = 5) and eight that did receive AZA (n = 8) at the time of conception. Results A total of forty-nine post-transplant conceptions were identified from 33 different renal transplanted males. MPA was used as the immunosuppressant in 28 of the conceptions. Males from the non-MPA group fathered the other 21 children. Median time from grafting to conception was 6.1 (IQR 2.4–11.1) years, and it was similar between groups. There were eight miscarriage episodes, 2 in the non-MPA group and 6 in the MPA group although differences were not reached. After that, all patients had children without problems. No malformations were detected in any of the 49 regardless whether they were exposed or not to MPA. Conclusions No evidence of MPA-associated malformations was observed in descendants of kidney transplanted males on treatment with MPA. Further research is warranted to confirm our findings to properly advice transplanted males keen to procreate."
https://openalex.org/W2890531684,"Almost 80% of the 4 billion projected increase in world population by 2100 comes from 37 Mid-African Countries (MACs), caused mostly by slow declines in Total Fertility Rate (TFR). Historically, TFR has declined in response to increases in wellbeing associated with economic development. We show that, when Infant Survival Rate (ISR, a proxy for wellbeing) has increased, MAC fertility has declined at the same rate, in relation to ISR, as it did in 61 comparable Other Developing Countries (ODCs) whose average fertility is close to replacement level. If MAC ISR were to increase at the historic rate of these ODCs, and TFR declined correspondingly, then the projected world population in 2100 would be decreasing and 1.1 billion lower than currently projected. Such rates of ISR increase, and TFR decrease, are quite feasible and have occurred in comparable ODCs. Increased efforts to improve the wellbeing of poor MAC populations are key."
https://openalex.org/W2890725405,"Antagonists of the 5-hydroxytryptamine (serotonin) 3 receptor (5-HT3R) have anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic activities, but the detailed, underlying mechanisms are not well understood. We focused on anti-apoptotic activities via 5-HT3R signaling to clarify the underlying mechanisms. Mice were administered 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), which induced apoptosis in intestinal epithelial cells. Coadministration with 5-HT3R antagonists or agonists tended to decrease or increase the number of apoptotic cells, respectively. In serotonin 3A receptor (5-HT3AR) null (HTR3A−/−) mice, the number of apoptotic cells induced by 5-FU was decreased compared with that in wild-type (WT) mice. Bone marrow (BM) transplantation was performed to determine if BM-derived immune cells regulated 5-FU-induced apoptosis, but they were found to be unrelated to this process. Data from 5-HT3AR/enhanced green fluorescent protein reporter mice revealed that 50% of enterochromaffin (EC) cells expressed 5-HT3AR, but the number of apoptotic cells induced by 5-FU in the intestinal crypt organoids of HTR3A−/− mice was not altered compared with WT mice. In contrast, plasma 5-HT concentrations in WT mice but not in HTR3A−/− mice administered 5-FU were increased significantly. In conclusion, 5-HT3R signaling may enhance 5-HT release, possibly from EC cells intravascularly, or paracrine, resulting in increases in plasma 5-HT concentration, which in turn, enhances apoptotic activities induced by 5-FU—Mikawa, S., Kondo, M., Kaji, N., Mihara, T., Yoshitake, R., Nakagawa, T., Takamoto, M., Nishimura, R., Shimada, S., Ozaki, H., Hori, M.

https://openalex.org/W2892236630,"To better understand the mechanisms that govern the development of retinal neurons, it is critical to gain additional insight into the specific intrinsic factors that control cell fate decisions and neuronal maturation. In the developing mouse retina, Atoh7, a highly conserved transcription factor, is essential for retinal ganglion cell development. Moreover, Atoh7 expression in the developing retina occurs during a critical time period when progenitor cells are in the process of making cell fate decisions. We performed transcriptome profiling of Atoh7+ individual cells isolated from mouse retina. One of the genes that we found significantly correlated with Atoh7 in our transcriptomic data was the E3 ubiquitin ligase, Trim9. The correlation between Trim9 and Atoh7 coupled with the expression of Trim9 in the early mouse retina led us to hypothesize that this gene may play a role in the process of cell fate determination. To address the role of Trim9 in retinal development, we performed a functional analysis of Trim9 in the mouse and did not detect any morphological changes in the retina in the absence of Trim9. Thus, Trim9 alone does not appear to be involved in cell fate determination or early ganglion cell development in the mouse retina. We further hypothesize that the reason for this lack of phenotype may be compensation by one of the many additional TRIM family members we find expressed in the developing retina."
https://openalex.org/W2891008422,"Post-dispersal seed consumption by rainforest vertebrates on the forest floor can substantially influence the community dynamics of rainforest trees. Studies of rainforest vertebrate seed predators at a community level, however, are lacking. Furthermore, there is very limited understanding of the effects of forest fragmentation on seed predators and their feeding behaviour. Here, we test whether communities of vertebrate seed predators, and their patterns of feeding on rainforest tree seeds, are altered when clearing creates forest fragments in an agricultural matrix. Using infra-red trail cameras deployed at stations with and without seeds of 20 local tree species, we identified four mammal and three bird species (from 18 recorded vertebrate taxa at mainly species level) as common post-dispersal seed predators in subtropical rainforest of eastern Australia. Statistical comparisons of species-specific frequencies between six sites in continuous forest and six in small rainforest fragments (4-21 ha) showed that habitat fragmentation substantially altered species composition of seed predator communities. Two species, both small rodents, had lower abundances in fragments than in continuous forest, while higher abundances were observed in fragments for a further four species: two small birds, a medium-sized marsupial and the small non-native rodent Rattus rattus. The abundance of one larger bird species did not change. Predatory interest in seeds was also significantly affected by habitat fragmentation and generally increased in each species' habitat of greater abundance. Collectively, seed predators showed behaviours associated with potential or actual seed consumption on an average of 43% of camera days with seeds, with about 50% of seeds physically removed or damaged after five days' exposure. Camera data have revealed community-level changes in seed predator abundance and feeding that are likely to cause altered patterns of plant recruitment following rainforest fragmentation, but these will be complex in nature."
https://openalex.org/W2889892459,"Problem Solving (PS) skills allow students to handle problems within an educational context. PS is a core competence of Computer Science education and affects programming success. In this vein, this paper aims to investigate PS ability performance in primary school pupils of a computer course, implemented according to the Neo-Piagetian theory of cognitive development. The study included 945 Slovenian pupils, ranging from fourth to sixth grade. The effects of gender, age and consecutive years of attending the course were examined on pupils’ PS ability at the pre-operational and concrete operational stages. Pupils completed a survey questionnaire with four types of tasks (a series of statements, if-statements, loops and variables) at both stages. The analysis revealed three findings: the performance of PS ability in all tasks was, at the pre-operational stage, associated positively with performance at the concrete operational stage; there were no gender differences in PS performance at both stages, and both the grade and consecutive year of taking the computer course had an effect on PS ability performance at both stages. Those in the lowest grade and those taking the course for the first year reported lower performances than their older counterparts. These findings may help curriculum designers across the world develop efficient approaches to teaching computer courses."
https://openalex.org/W2890335288,"Most clinical trials exclude pregnant women in order to avoid the possibility of adverse embryonic and/or fetal effects. Currently, there are no evidence-based guidelines regarding appropriate methods for identifying early pregnancy among research subjects. This lack of guidance results in wide variation in pregnancy testing plans, leading to the potential for inadequate protection against embryonic or fetal exposure in some cases and unnecessary burdens on research participants in others, as well as inefficiencies caused by disagreements among sponsors, investigators, and regulators. To address this issue, the Clinical Trials Transformation Initiative convened content experts and stakeholders to develop recommendations for pregnancy testing in clinical research based on currently available evidence. Recommendations included: 1) the study protocol should clearly state the rationale for pregnancy testing and the plan for handling positive and indeterminate tests; 2) protocols should include an assessment of the pregnancy testing plan advantages (reduced risk of embryo/fetal exposure) versus the burdens (participant burden, study team workload, costs); 3) protocols should assess the participant burdens regarding the likelihood of false negative and false positive results; 4) participant administered home pregnancy testing should be avoided in clinical trials; and 5) the consent process should describe the extent of knowledge about the study intervention's potential risk to the embryo/fetus and the limitations and consequences of pregnancy testing. CTTI has also developed an online tool to help implement these recommendations."
https://openalex.org/W2889759176,"To evaluate factors within the social-ecological framework associated with most or moderately effective contraception, condom and dual method use at last coitus among young, HIV-infected women in Atlanta.This is a cross-sectional study conducted from November, 2013 until August, 2015 at the Grady Infectious Disease Clinic in Atlanta, Georgia. We recruited perinatally and horizontally HIV-infected women of ages 14-30 years to complete an audio computer-assisted self-interview. We evaluated factors within a social-ecological framework associated with most or moderately effective contraceptive use (hormonal contraception or an IUD), condom use, and dual method use (use of condom and most or moderately effective contraceptive) at last coitus.Of 103 women enrolled, 74 reported a history of sexual activity. The average age was 22.1; 89% were African American, 52% were perinatally infected, 89% received combination antiretroviral therapy, and 63% had undetectable viral loads. At last coitus, 46% reported most or moderately effective contraception, 62% reported condom use and 27% reporting dual-method use. The odds of most or moderately effective contraceptive use was significantly reduced among those with detectable viral loads (versus undetectable viral loads; aOR 0.13 [0.04, 0.38]). Older age (aOR 0.85 [0.74, 0.98] and more frequent coitus (>once/week versus < = once/week; aOR 0.24 [0.08, 0.72]) was significantly associated with reduced condom use. Having a detectable viral load (versus undetectable viral loads; aOR 0.13 [0.03, 0.69]) and more frequent coitus (>once/week versus < = once/week; aOR 0.14 [0.03,0.82]), was associated with reduced dual method use, while being enrolled in school (aOR 5.63 [1.53, 20.71]) was significantly associated with increased dual method use.Most or moderately effective contraception, condom and dual method use remained inadequate in this cohort of young HIV-infected women. Individual-level interventions are needed to increase the uptake of dual methods with user-independent contraceptives."
https://openalex.org/W2891352220,"Snail2 is a zinc-finger transcription factor best known to repress expression of genes encoding cell adherence proteins to facilitate induction of the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. While this role has been best documented in the developmental migration of the neural crest and mesoderm, here we expand on previously reported preliminary findings that morpholino knock-down of snai2 impairs the generation of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) during zebrafish development. We demonstrate that snai2 morphants fail to initiate HSC specification and show defects in the somitic niche of migrating HSC precursors. These defects include a reduction in sclerotome markers as well as in the Notch ligands dlc and dld, which are known to be essential components of HSC specification. Accordingly, enforced expression of the Notch1-intracellular domain was capable of rescuing HSC specification in snai2 morphants. To parallel our approach, we obtained two mutant alleles of snai2. In contrast to the morphants, homozygous mutant embryos displayed no defects in HSC specification or in sclerotome development, and mutant fish survive into adulthood. However, when these homozygous mutants were injected with snai2 morpholino, HSCs were improperly specified. In summary, our morpholino data support a role for Snai2 in HSC development, whereas our mutant data suggest that Snai2 is dispensable for this process. Together, these findings further support the need for careful consideration of both morpholino and mutant phenotypes in studies of gene function."
https://openalex.org/W2890257361,"North American zoological institutions typically feed ground raw meat diets to large exotic cats. These diets typically are nutritionally complete, but lack physical properties characteristic of whole prey. Lack of mastication and prey manipulation may contribute to behavioral and health challenges. Pork by-products may provide environmental enrichment to mitigate these challenges. The objectives of this study were to evaluate a pig head for nutritional composition and to determine if a pig head was biologically relevant environmental enrichment for managed large exotic cats. Pig heads consisted of: DM: 48.5%; OM: 60.7%; CP: 38.4%; fat: 22.0%; CF: 13.5%; TDF: 3.4%; GE: 4.1 kcal/g DM. Five individually housed exotic cats (Panthera tigris tigris, Panthera tigris altaica (n = 2), Panthera tigris jacksoni, Panthera leo) were observed in 2-h blocks, 24-h before pig head introduction (Baseline), at time of pig head introduction (Enrichment) and immediately after the pig head was removed (Post Enrichment) via instantaneous scan sampling for 4 consecutive weeks. Active behaviors were 55.7% higher on Enrichment compared to Baseline days, and 26.4% higher compared to Post Enrichment days (p<0.0001). Active behaviors were 39.8% higher on Post Enrichment compared to Baseline days (p<0.0001). Total active behaviors were highest (p<0.0001) in week 3 and lowest (p<0.0001) in week 4 with differences as high as 64.5% seen among weeks. In conclusion, pig heads have potential to provide nutrient dense enrichment to large exotic cats, and employing a pig head as environmental enrichment increased active behaviors and did not lose novelty."
