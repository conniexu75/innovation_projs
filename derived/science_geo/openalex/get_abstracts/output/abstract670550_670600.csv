https://openalex.org/W3131287340,"The 501Y.V2 variants of SARS-CoV-2 containing multiple mutations in spike are now dominant in South Africa and are rapidly spreading to other countries. Here, experiments with 18 pseudotyped viruses showed that the 501Y.V2 variants do not confer increased infectivity in multiple cell types except for murine ACE2-overexpressing cells, where a substantial increase in infectivity was observed. Notably, the susceptibility of the 501Y.V2 variants to 12 of 17 neutralizing monoclonal antibodies was substantially diminished, and the neutralization ability of the sera from convalescent patients and immunized mice was also reduced for these variants. The neutralization resistance was mainly caused by E484K and N501Y mutations in the receptor-binding domain of spike. The enhanced infectivity in murine ACE2-overexpressing cells suggests the possibility of spillover of the 501Y.V2 variants to mice. Moreover, the neutralization resistance we detected for the 501Y.V2 variants suggests the potential for compromised efficacy of monoclonal antibodies and vaccines."

Radio astronomy could provide individual identifications if the molecule is sufficiently abundant and has a large dipole moment, but PAHs are expected to produce large numbers of very weak lines. McGuire et al. performed a stacking and matched filter analysis to search for PAHs in radio observations of TMC-1, located within the interstellar Taurus Molecular Cloud. They identified emission from two isomers of the small PAH cyanonapthalene, two fused benzene rings with a CN group attached. Science , this issue p. 1265"
https://openalex.org/W3137953428,"The non-trivial topological features in the energy band of non-Hermitian systems provide promising pathways to achieve robust physical behaviors in classical or quantum open systems. A key topological feature, unique to non-Hermitian systems, is the non-trivial winding of the energy band in the complex energy plane. Here we provide direct experimental demonstrations of such non-trivial winding, by implementing non-Hermitian lattice Hamiltonians along a frequency synthetic dimension formed in a ring resonator undergoing simultaneous phase and amplitude modulations, and by directly characterizing the complex band structures. Moreover, we show that the topological winding can be straightforwardly controlled by changing the modulation waveform. Our results open a pathway for the experimental synthesis and characterization of topologically non-trivial phases in non-conservative systems."
https://openalex.org/W3163212391,"The ability to control the strength of interaction is essential for studying quantum phenomena emerging from a system of correlated fermions. For example, the isotope effect illustrates the effect of electron-phonon coupling on superconductivity, providing an important experimental support for the BCS theory. In this work, we report a new device geometry where the magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene (tBLG) is placed in close proximity to a Bernal bilayer graphene (BLG) separated by a 3 nm thick barrier. Using charge screening from the Bernal bilayer, the strength of electron-electron Coulomb interaction within the twisted bilayer can be continuously tuned. Transport measurements show that tuning Coulomb screening has opposite effect on the insulating and superconducting states: as Coulomb interaction is weakened by screening, the insulating states become less robust, whereas the stability of superconductivity is enhanced. Out results demonstrate the ability to directly probe the role of Coulomb interaction in magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene. Most importantly, the effect of Coulomb screening points toward electron-phonon coupling as the dominant mechanism for Cooper pair formation, and therefore superconductivity, in magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene."

Yan et al. created nanoscale tandem catalysts by growing an ∼2-nanometer shell of indium oxide, a selective hydrogen combustion catalyst, over a propane dehydrogenation catalyst, platinum nanoparticles supported on alumina spheres (see the Perspective by Pei and Gong). This overcoat exposed the platinum nanoparticles for propane dehydrogenation. Surface hydrogen atoms were oxidized at the indium oxide–platinum interface.

https://openalex.org/W3139482760,"The α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor plays critical roles in the central nervous system and in the cholinergic inflammatory pathway. This ligand-gated ion channel assembles as a homopentamer, is exceptionally permeable to Ca2+, and desensitizes faster than any other Cys-loop receptor. The α7 receptor has served as a prototype for the Cys-loop superfamily yet has proven refractory to structural analysis. We present cryo-EM structures of the human α7 nicotinic receptor in a lipidic environment in resting, activated, and desensitized states, illuminating the principal steps in the gating cycle. The structures also reveal elements that contribute to its function, including a C-terminal latch that is permissive for channel opening, and an anionic ring in the extracellular vestibule that contributes to its high conductance and calcium permeability. Comparisons among the α7 structures provide a foundation for mapping the gating cycle and reveal divergence in gating mechanisms in the Cys-loop receptor superfamily."

Therefore, the Wuhan cluster of infections identified in late December of 2019 may not have represented the initiating event. Pekar et al. used genome data collected from the early cases of the COVID-19 pandemic combined with molecular clock inference and epidemiological simulation to estimate when the most successful variant gained a foothold in humans. This analysis pushes human-to-human transmission back to mid-October to mid-November of 2019 in Hubei Province, China, with a likely short interval before epidemic transmission was initiated.

https://openalex.org/W3138099387,"The long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) XIST establishes X chromosome inactivation (XCI) in female cells in early development and thereafter is thought to be largely dispensable. Here, we show XIST is continually required in adult human B cells to silence a subset of X-linked immune genes such as TLR7. XIST-dependent genes lack promoter DNA methylation and require continual XIST-dependent histone deacetylation. XIST RNA-directed proteomics and CRISPRi screen reveal distinctive somatic cell-type-specific XIST complexes and identify TRIM28 that mediates Pol II pausing at promoters of X-linked genes in B cells. Single-cell transcriptome data of female patients with either systemic lupus erythematosus or COVID-19 infection revealed XIST dysregulation, reflected by escape of XIST-dependent genes, in CD11c+ atypical memory B cells (ABCs). XIST inactivation with TLR7 agonism suffices to promote isotype-switched ABCs. These results indicate cell-type-specific diversification and function for lncRNA-protein complexes and suggest expanded roles for XIST in sex-differences in biology and medicine."
https://openalex.org/W3139129400,"Cryo-EM helps engineer enhanced IL-10 Interleukin-10 (IL-10) binds to the IL-10 receptor (IL-10R), comprising two high-affinity α chains and two low-affinity β chains. Depending on the cellular context of its recognition, IL-10 can either suppress or activate immune responses. This pleiotropic behavior has complicated efforts to use IL-10 as an anti-inflammatory agent. Saxton et al. generated a high-affinity version of IL-10 (super-10), which allowed them to visualize IL-10 in complex with both IL-10Rα and IL-10Rβ by cryo–electron microscopy (cryo-EM). This enabled them to engineer additional variants of IL-10 with variable IL-10Rβ–binding affinities. Some of the partial agonists exhibited biased actions on myeloid cells, which exhibited anti-inflammatory properties without concomitant CD8 T cell activation. These findings may serve as a blueprint for future enhanced cytokine–based therapeutics. Science , this issue p. eabc8433"
https://openalex.org/W3135941583,"The intestine is a site of direct encounter with the external environment and must consequently balance barrier defense with nutrient uptake. To investigate how nutrient uptake is regulated in the small intestine, we tested the effect of diets with different macronutrient compositions on epithelial gene expression. We found that enzymes and transporters required for carbohydrate digestion and absorption were regulated by carbohydrate availability. The ""on-demand"" induction of this machinery required γδ T cells, which regulated this program through the suppression of interleukin-22 production by type 3 innate lymphoid cells. Nutrient availability altered the tissue localization and transcriptome of γδ T cells. Additionally, transcriptional responses to diet involved cellular remodeling of the epithelial compartment. Thus, this work identifies a role for γδ T cells in nutrient sensing."

Starting from this so-called Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) limit, increasing interactions can set the system on a path of crossover to the opposite limit of small, tightly bound electron pairs that undergo Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC). Nakagawa et al. intercalated lithium ions into the insulating material zirconium nitride chloride, varying the carrier density across a large range (see the Perspective by Randeria).

Hirsch and Koren found that this smoke caused record-breaking levels of aerosols over the Southern Hemisphere, as much as that from a moderate volcanic eruption.

This aerosol increase caused considerable cooling over oceanic cloud-free areas. Science , this issue p. 1269"
https://openalex.org/W3137364735,"Although cell lineage information is fundamental to understanding organismal development, very little direct information is available for humans. We performed high-depth (250×) whole-genome sequencing of multiple tissues from three individuals to identify hundreds of somatic single-nucleotide variants (sSNVs). Using these variants as ""endogenous barcodes"" in single cells, we reconstructed early embryonic cell divisions. Targeted sequencing of clonal sSNVs in different organs (about 25,000×) and in more than 1000 cortical single cells, as well as single-nucleus RNA sequencing and single-nucleus assay for transposase-accessible chromatin sequencing of ~100,000 cortical single cells, demonstrated asymmetric contributions of early progenitors to extraembryonic tissues, distinct germ layers, and organs. Our data suggest onset of gastrulation at an effective progenitor pool of about 170 cells and about 50 to 100 founders for the forebrain. Thus, mosaic mutations provide a permanent record of human embryonic development at very high resolution."

https://openalex.org/W3138002411,"COVID-19 pandemic is an immediate major public health concern. The search for the understanding of the disease spreading made scientists around the world turn their attention to epidemiological studies. An interesting approach in epidemiological modeling nowadays is to use agent-based models, which allow to consider a heterogeneous population and to evaluate the role of superspreaders in this population. In this work, we implemented an agent-based model using probabilistic cellular automata to simulate SIR (Susceptible-Infected-Recovered) dynamics using COVID-19 infection parameters. Differently to the usual studies, we did not define the superspreaders individuals a priori , we only left the agents to execute a random walk along the sites. When two or more agents share the same site, there is a probability to spread the infection if one of them is infected. To evaluate the spreading, we built the transmission network and measured the degree distribution, betweenness, and closeness centrality. The results displayed for different levels of mobility restriction show that the degree reduces as the mobility reduces, but there is an increase of betweenness and closeness for some network nodes. We identified the superspreaders at the end of the simulation, showing the emerging behavior of the model since these individuals were not initially defined. Simulations also showed that the superspreaders are responsible for most of the infection propagation and the impact of personal protective equipment in the spreading of the infection. We believe that this study can bring important insights for the analysis of the disease dynamics and the role of superspreaders, contributing to the understanding of how to manage mobility during a highly infectious pandemic as COVID-19."
https://openalex.org/W3138619629,"Background According to the 2017 estimate, around 214 million reproductive-age women in developing regions who want to avoid pregnancy do not use a modern contraceptive method. Although there are studies done on factors associated with modern contraceptive utilization in individual East African countries, as to our search of the literature, there is limited evidence on the pooled prevalence and determinants of modern contraceptive utilization in the East African region. Therefore, this study aimed to estimate the pooled prevalence and determinants of modern contraceptive utilization in the East African region. Methods The pooled prevalence of modern contraceptive utilization and the strength of determinants were estimated using STATA version 14. Intra-class Correlation Coefficient (ICC), Median Odds Ratio (MOR), Proportional Change in Variance (PCV), and deviance were used for model fitness and comparison. The multilevel logistic regression model was fitted to identify determinants of modern contraceptive use in the region. Adjusted Odds Ratio with its 95% Confidence Interval was presented, and variables with a p-value ≤of 0.05 were declared significant determinants of modern contraceptive utilization. Results Overall, about 20.68% (95%CI:-20.46.,20.91)of women used modern contraceptive, ranging from 9.08% in Mozambique to 61.49% in Comoros. In the multilevel logistic regression model; maternal age group 25–34 (AOR: 0.79, 95%CI:0.76,0.82) and 35–49 (AOR:0.49, 95%CI:0.46,0.51). Being married (AOR:0.85, 95%CI:0.82,0.88), mothers with primary education (AOR:1.48, 95%CI:1.43,1.54) and secondary and above education level (AOR:1.60, 95%CI:1.52,1.69), husbands with primary education (AOR:2.43, 95%CI:2.35,2.51) and secondary and above education level (AOR:2.92, 95%CI:2.76,3.05). The mothers who had occupation (AOR:2.11, 95%CI:1.23,1.33), mothers from households with middle wealth index (AOR:1.23, 95%CI:1.19,1.28) and rich wealth index (AOR:1.28, 95%CI:1.23,1.33) were found to be significant determinants of modern contraceptive use. Conclusion We found that modern contraceptive utilization in the 12 East Africa countries was low compared to SDG target 2030(75%). The governmental and non-governmental organizations should scale up their public health programs to the poor and marginalized communities to scale up modern contraceptive utilization uptake in the region. In addition, reforming the health system and reproductive health education through mass media to create awareness of modern contraceptive use benefits are effective strategies to improve modern contraceptive use among East Africa women."

It is essential that accurate information is distributed; however, misinformation has been spread via social media. Consequently, the resulting panic has to be addressed while putting essential public health measures in place. It is also important to explore the link between the social media exposure and well-being. Therefore, in the current study, we aimed to identify the levels of anxiety, depression, and social isolation among individuals during the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, we explored the relationship between exposure to misleading social media news and anxiety, depression, and social isolation. A cross sectional design was employed to collect data from 371 Saudi participants (aged 16–60 years), using the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7, Centre for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale, and de Jong Gierveld Loneliness Scale. Results showed that the prevalence of anxiety, depression, and social isolation was 47.82%, 47.57%, and 46.42%, respectively. Further, more than 83% of the participants reported using social media frequently during the pandemic. We found that exposure to misinformation via social media has a significant positive relationship with anxiety, depression, and social isolation. However, Due to the cross-sectional nature of this study it cannot be determined whether social media causes negative mental health outcomes, or if individuals experiencing greater depression, anxiety and social isolation turn to social media more than others, or if some third variable might explain both. Based on our findings, we present specific suggestions related to the COVID-19 pandemic to the government of Saudi Arabia. Minoring and filtering out misleading information with the cooperation of the World Health Organization (WHO) can promote the spread of accurate news in Saudi Arabia."
https://openalex.org/W3136731595,"Background In December 2019, a new disease named coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was occurred. Patients who are critically ill with COVID-19 are more likely to die, especially elderly patients. We aimed to describe the effect of age on the clinical and immune characteristics of critically ill patients with COVID-19. Methods We retrospectively included 32 patients with COVID-19 who were confirmed to have COVID-19 by the local health authority and who were admitted to the first affiliated hospital of Zhengzhou University in Zhengzhou, China between January 3 and March 20, 2020. Clinical information and experimental test data were retrospectively collected for the patients. The 32 patients in this study were all in a critical condition and were classified as severe, according to the guidelines of 2019-nCoV infection from the National Health Commission of the People’s Republic of China. Data were compared between those &lt;60 years old and ≥60 years old. Results Of 32 patients, 13 were under 60 years old, and 19 patients were ≥60 years old. The most common symptom among all patients upon admission was fever (93.8%, 30/32). Compared to younger patients, older patients exhibited increased comorbidities. Among patients who were 60 years and older, platelet count, direct bilirubin (DBIL), indirect bilirubin(IBIL), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP), C-reactive protein (CRP), procalcitonin (PCT), and interleukin-10 (IL-10) were significantly higher than in younger patients who were less than 60 years old. CD4+ T lymphocytes, CD8+ T lymphocytes, and NKT lymphocytes were decreased, CD4+/CD8+ T lymphocytes were significantly increased in all 32 patients, while there were no evident differences between younger and older patients. The CURB-65 (confusion, urea, respiratory, rate, blood pressure plus age ≥65 years), Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II and pH value were significantly higher in older patients than in patients who were under 60 years old. However, the PaO2 and PaO2:FiO2 were lower in older patients than the younger. Compared to patients under 60 years old, patients who were 60 years and older tended to develop ARDS (15 [78.9%] vs 5 [38.5%]), septic shock (7 [36.8%] vs 0 [0.0%]) and were more likely to receive mechanical ventilation (13 [68.4%] vs 3[23.1%]). Dynamic trajectories of seven laboratory parameters were tracked on days 1, 3, 5 and 7, and significant differences in lymphocyte count ( P = 0.026), D-dimer ( P = 0.010), lactate dehydrogenase ( P = 0.000) and C-reactive protein ( P = 0.000) were observed between the two age groups. Conclusions A high proportion of critically ill patients were 60 or older. Furthermore, rapid disease progression was noted in elderly patients. Therefore, close monitoring and timely treatment should be performed in elderly COVID-19 patients."

The current study in mice was conducted to characterize the bioenergetic, metabolomic, breathomic, and behavioral features of acute hyperpurinergia triggered by systemic injection of the purinergic agonist and danger signal, extracellular ATP (eATP). Responses were studied in C57BL/6J mice in the maternal immune activation (MIA) model and controls. Basal metabolic rates and locomotor activity were measured in CLAMS cages. Plasma metabolomics measured 401 metabolites. Breathomics measured 98 volatile organic compounds. Intraperitoneal eATP dropped basal metabolic rate measured by whole body oxygen consumption by 74% ± 6% (mean ± SEM) and rectal temperature by 6.2˚ ± 0.3˚C in 30 minutes. Over 200 metabolites from 37 different biochemical pathways where changed. Breathomics showed an increase in exhaled carbon monoxide, dimethylsulfide, and isoprene. Metabolomics revealed an acute increase in lactate, citrate, purines, urea, dopamine, eicosanoids, microbiome metabolites, oxidized glutathione, thiamine, niacinamide, and pyridoxic acid, and decreased folate-methylation-1-carbon intermediates, amino acids, short and medium chain acyl-carnitines, phospholipids, ceramides, sphingomyelins, cholesterol, bile acids, and vitamin D similar to some children with ASD. MIA animals were hypersensitive to postnatal exposure to eATP or poly(IC), which produced a rebound increase in body temperature that lasted several weeks before returning to baseline. Acute hyperpurinergia produced metabolic and behavioral changes in mice. The behaviors and metabolic changes produced by ATP injection were associated with mitochondrial functional changes that were profound but reversible."

One such group of natural biocontrol agents which may be used as biopesticides is that of the entomopathogenic fungi and their toxic secondary metabolites (mycotoxins). The present in vitro work examined the insecticidal potential of 65 commercially-available mycotoxins against the insect Sf-9 cell line. Mammalian Caco-2 and THP-1 cell lines served as reference controls to select insecticidal mycotoxins harmless to mammalian cells. All tested mycotoxins significantly reduced the in vitro proliferation of the Sf-9 cells and evoked morphological changes. Ten of the mycotoxins found to strongly inhibit Sf-9 proliferation also had moderate or no effect on Caco-2 cells. The THP-1 cells were highly resistant to the tested mycotoxins: doses 10 3 times higher were needed to affect viability and morphology (1 μg/ml for THP-1 versus 1 ng/ml for Sf-9 and Caco-2). Nine mycotoxins significantly decreased Sf-9 cell proliferation with minor effects on mammalian cells: cyclosporins B and D, cytochalasin E, gliotoxin, HC toxin, paxilline, penitrem A, stachybotrylactam and verruculogen. These may be good candidates for future biopesticide formulations."

The study assessed the yield of TB cases from the TB screening activities among AMC in Ghana, the factors associated with TB in these communities and the correlation between the screening methods and a diagnosis of TB. Methods We conducted secondary data analyses of NTP program data collected from TB case finding activities using symptom screening and mobile X-ray implemented in hard to reach AMC. Yield of TB cases, number needed to screen (NNS) and the number needed to test (NNT) to detect a TB case were assessed and logistic regression were conducted to assess factors associated with TB. The performance of screening methods chest X-ray and symptoms in the detection of TB cases was also evaluated. Results In total 10,441 people from 78 communities in 24 districts were screened, 55% were female and 60% (6,296) were in the aged 25 to 54 years. Ninety-five TB cases were identified, 910 TB cases per 100,000 population screened; 5.6% of the TB cases were rifampicin resistant. Being male (aOR 5.96, 95% CI 3.25–10.92, P &lt; 0.001), a miner (aOR 2.70, 95% CI 1.47–4.96, P = 0.001) and age group 35 to 54 years (aOR 2.27, 95% CI 1.35–3.84, P = 0.002) were risk factors for TB. NNS and NNT were 110 and 24 respectively.; Cough of any duration had the strongest association with X-ray suggestive of TB with a correlation coefficient of 0.48. Cough was most sensitive for a diagnosis of TB; sensitivity of 86.3% (95% CI 79.4–93.2) followed by X-ray, sensitivity 81.1% (95% CI 71.7–88.4). The specificities of the symptoms and X-rays ranged from 80.2% (cough) to 97.3% (sputum). Conclusion The high risk of TB in the artisanal mining communities and in miners in this study reinforces the need to target these populations with outreach programs particularly in hard to reach areas. The diagnostic value of cough highlights the usefulness of symptom screening in this population that may be harnessed even in the absence of X-ray to identify those suspected to have TB for further evaluation."
https://openalex.org/W3139460872,"Background Maternal high fat diet (HFD) promotes chronic kidney disease (CKD) in offspring. This is in accordance with the theory of fetal programming, which suggests adverse conditions occurring in utero predispose offspring to chronic conditions later in life. DNA methylation has been proposed as a key mechanism by which fetal programming occurs and is implicated in CKD progression. DNA demethylating drugs may interrupt the fetal programming of CKD by maternal obesity. Hydralazine, an antihypertensive agent, demethylates DNA at low doses which do not reduce blood pressure. We used a mouse model of maternal obesity to determine whether gestational administration of low-dose hydralazine to mothers can prevent CKD in offspring. Methods C57BL/6 dams received HFD or chow from 6 weeks prior to mating and were administered subcutaneous hydralazine (5mg/kg) or saline thrice weekly during gestation. Male offspring were weaned to chow and were sacrificed at either postnatal week 9 or week 32. Biometric and metabolic parameters, renal global DNA methylation, renal structural and functional changes and markers of fibrosis, oxidative stress and inflammation were measured in offspring at weeks 9 and 32. Results In week 9 offspring, maternal HFD consumption did not significantly alter anthropometric or metabolic parameters, or renal global DNA methylation. Week 32 offspring had increased renal global DNA methylation, together with albuminuria, glomerulosclerosis, renal fibrosis and oxidative stress. Administration of low-dose hydralazine to obese mothers during gestation reduced renal global DNA methylation and renal fibrotic markers in week 32 offspring. Conclusion Gestational hydralazine reduced renal global DNA methylation in offspring of obese mothers and attenuated maternal obesity-induced renal fibrosis. These data support the use of low-dose hydralazine as a demethylating agent to prevent CKD arising in offspring due to maternal HFD consumption."
https://openalex.org/W3136718464,"Introduction The role of gender norms in shaping education and work opportunities, distribution of power and resources, and health and wellbeing is well recognised. However, rigorous studies in low- and middle-income countries on when and how norms change over time and what factors shape adolescents’ and young adult’s gender attitudes are limited. This paper explores the factors that determine adolescents’ gender attitudes, as well as patterns in gender attitude shifts over time among younger and older adolescent boys and girls in India. Data and methods Data presented in this paper were drawn from a unique longitudinal study of adolescents aged 10–19 (Understanding the lives of adolescent and young adults–UDAYA study) in the states of Bihar and Uttar Pradesh in India, conducted during 2015–2016 (wave 1) and 2018–2019 (wave 2). The analysis presented in this paper drew on data from 4,428 boys and 7,607 girls who were aged 10–19 and unmarried at wave 1 and interviewed at both rounds of the survey. We used univariate and bivariate analyses to examine changes in adolescents’ gender role attitudes over time and the association between explanatory variables and gender role attitudes. We also used linear fixed effects regression models to identify factors that shape adolescents’ gender role attitudes. Results Gender role attitudes became more egalitarian over time among boys and girls, except among the older cohort of boys in our study. Among both younger and older cohorts, girls/young women held more egalitarian views than boys/young men and this pattern held over time for both cohorts. Factors that influenced gender role attitudes differed for younger and older adolescents, particularly among boys. While some predictors differed for boys and girls, there were substantial similarities as well. Gender attitudes were affected by factors at the individual, family, peer, and societal levels, as well as by community engagement. Conclusions Our findings show that it is possible to shift gender attitudes toward greater equity and, in so doing, contribute to improved health and rights."
https://openalex.org/W3137480848,"Nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) plays a critical role in the host defense against microbial pathogens. Many pathogens modulate NF-κB signaling to establish infection in their host. Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium ( S . Typhimurium) possesses two type III secretion systems (T3SS-1 and T3SS-2) and directly injects many effector proteins into host cells. It has been reported that some effectors block NF-κB signaling, but the molecular mechanism of the inactivation of NF-κB signaling in S . Typhimurium is poorly understood. Here, we identified seven type III effectors—GogA, GtgA, PipA, SseK1, SseK2, SseK3, and SteE—that inhibited NF-κB activation in HeLa cells stimulated with TNF-α. We also determined that only GogA and GtgA are involved in regulation of the activation of NF-κB in HeLa cells infected with S . Typhimurium. GogA, GtgA, and PipA are highly homologous to one another and have the consensus zinc metalloprotease HEXXH motif. Our experiments demonstrated that GogA, GtgA, and PipA each directly cleaved NF-κB p65, whereas GogA and GtgA, but not PipA, inhibited the NF-κB activation in HeLa cells infected with S . Typhimurium. Further, expressions of the gogA or gtgA gene were induced under the SPI-1-and SPI-2-inducing conditions, but expression of the pipA gene was induced only under the SPI-2-inducing condition. We also showed that PipA was secreted into RAW264.7 cells through T3SS-2. Finally, we indicated that PipA elicits bacterial dissemination in the systemic stage of infection of S . Typhimurium via a T3SS-1-independent mechanism. Collectively, our results suggest that PipA, GogA and GtgA contribute to S . Typhimurium pathogenesis in different ways."
https://openalex.org/W3138287906,"Vision impairment due to optic neuritis (ON) is one of the major clinical presentations in Multiple Sclerosis (MS) and is characterized by inflammation and degeneration of the optic nerve and retina. Currently available treatments are only partially effective and have a limited impact on the neuroinflammatory pathology of the disease. A recent study from our laboratory highlighted the beneficial effect of arginase 2 (A2) deletion in suppressing retinal neurodegeneration and inflammation in an experimental model of MS. Utilizing the same model, the present study investigated the impact of A2 deficiency on MS-induced optic neuritis. Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) was induced in wild-type (WT) and A2 knockout (A2-/-) mice. EAE-induced cellular infiltration, as well as activation of microglia and macrophages, were reduced in A2-/- optic nerves. Axonal degeneration and demyelination seen in EAE optic nerves were observed to be reduced with A2 deletion. Further, the lack of A2 significantly ameliorated astrogliosis induced by EAE. In conclusion, our findings demonstrate a critical involvement of arginase 2 in mediating neuroinflammation in optic neuritis and suggest the potential of A2 blockade as a targeted therapy for MS-induced optic neuritis."

Vullo et al. describe a new species of shark from the late Cretaceous that shows that the lack of current variation is not due to limited morphological “exploration” in the past. Specifically, Aquilolamna milarcae displays many features similar to modern manta rays, notably long, slender fins and a mouth seemingly adapted to filter feeding, suggesting that it was planktivorous. This finding indicates both that elasmobranchs evolutionarily experimented with other forms and that the planktivorous “soarers” emerged in this group at least 30 million years earlier than previously recognized.

https://openalex.org/W3138143037,"Most of the soils of Nepal had a higher potassium (K, expressed as K 2 O) level inherently. Later in 1976, the Government of Nepal has recommended K fertilizer rate at 30 kg K 2 O ha -1 in rice-wheat cropping systems. However, those crops began showing K deficiency symptoms in recent decades, which could be due to a large portion of soils with depleted K level or the insufficient input of K fertilizer for crop production. This study explored a limitation of K nutrient in the crops by establishing field trials from 2009–2014 at three agro-ecozones i.e., inner-Terai (2009–2010), high-Hills (2011–2012), and Terai (2012–2014) in Nepal. Seven rates of K fertilizer at 0, 15, 30, 45, 60, 75, and 90 kg K 2 O ha -1 were replicated four times in a randomized complete block design, where crop yields and yield-attributing parameters of rice-wheat cropping system were recorded. Results revealed that an increase in K rates from 45 to 75 kg K 2 O ha -1 under inner-Terai and Terai conditions and 45 to 60 kg ha -1 under high-Hills conditions produced significantly higher grain yields compared to the recommended K dose. Economically, the optimum rate of K fertilizer should not exceed 68 kg K 2 O ha -1 for rice in all agro-ecozones, or 73 kg K 2 O ha -1 for wheat in inner-Terai and 60 kg K 2 O ha -1 for wheat in high-Hills and Terai. Our findings suggest to increase potassium application in between 1.5 to 2.5 times of the current K fertilizer rate in rice-wheat cropping system of Nepal that need to be tested further in different locations and crop varieties."
https://openalex.org/W3137170952,"Dopamine (DA) exerts well-known functions in the brain as a neurotransmitter. In addition, it plays important physiological roles in peripheral organs, but it is largely unknown how and where peripheral DA is synthesized and regulated. Catecholamines in peripheral tissues are either produced within the tissue itself and/or derived from sympathetic neurons, which release neurotransmitters for uptake by peripheral tissues. To evaluate DA-producing ability of each peripheral tissue, we generated conditional KO mice (cKO mice) in which the tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) gene is ablated in the sympathoadrenal system, thus eliminating sympathetic neurons as a DA source. We then examined the alterations in the noradrenaline (NA), DA, and 3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA) contents in peripheral organs and performed immunohistochemical analyses of TH-expressing cells. In the heart and pancreas of cKO mice, both the TH protein and NA levels were significantly decreased, and the DA contents were decreased in parallel with NA contents, indicating that the DA supply originated from sympathetic neurons. We found TH-immunoreactive cells in the stomach and lung, where the TH protein showed a decreasing trend, but the DA levels were not decreased in cKO mice. Moreover, we found a significant correlation between the DA content in the kidney and the plasma DOPA concentration, suggesting that the kidney takes up DOPA from blood to make DA. The aforementioned data unravel differences in the DA biosynthetic pathway among tissues and support the role of sympathetic neurons as a DA supplier.

Dopamine (DA) is a neurotransmitter in the brain, and alterations in DA metabolism are related to the pathophysiology of neuropsychiatric disorders, such as Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia, and some developmental disorders. In addition to its role in the brain, DA also plays pivotal physiological functions in peripheral tissues, such as natriuresis in the kidney (1Harris R.C. Zhang M.Z.

DA regulates these functions via DA receptors belonging to G protein–coupled receptors. Despite the important physiological function, less attention has been given to the metabolism of DA in these peripheral organs. Gastrointestinal dysfunction is prevalent in patients with Parkinson's disease, a dopaminergic neurodegenerative disease (11Lubomski M. Davis R.L. Sue C.M.

Psychiatry. 2002; 59: 337-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar). As these symptoms are thought to be caused by perturbation of the peripheral DA metabolism, it is important for not only physiology but also pharmacology to clarify how peripheral DA concentration is regulated. In the nervous system, DA is synthesized from tyrosine. Tyrosine hydroxylase (TH; enzyme commission number: 1.14.16.2) catalyzes the conversion of tyrosine to 3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA), the rate-limiting step to regulate the amount of DA (14Nagatsu T. Levitt M. Udenfriend S. Tyrosine Hydroxylase: The initial step in norepinephrine biosynthesis.J. Biol. Chem. 1964; 239: 2910-2917Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the synthesis and regulation of DA contents in peripheral tissues are largely unknown because of its complicated synthetic pathways. There are three pathways to synthesize DA in peripheral tissues. A group of cells, called amine precursor uptake and decarboxylation (APUD) cells, produce DA from DOPA, which is taken up from the circulating blood, by the reaction of aromatic amino acid decarboxylase (AADC; enzyme commission number: 4.1.1.28), which catalyzes the conversion of DOPA to DA (15Goldstein D.S.

Metab. 1997; 82: 3864-3871Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar), suggesting the synthesis of DOPA by TH in these tissues. In addition, the sympathetic neurons innervating each organ can synthesize DA as a precursor of noradrenaline (NA) and may release DA under some circumstances (20Schömig A. Dart A.M. Dietz R. Mayer E. Kübler W. Release of endogenous catecholamines in the ischemic myocardium of the rat. Part A: Locally mediated release.Circ. Res. 1984; 55: 689-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). It is therefore difficult to know how much DA is intrinsically synthesized in each tissue, and whether the sympathetic neurons may contribute to local DA production in peripheral organs. Although the circulating DOPA concentration may affect DA production in APUD cells, the origin of circulating DOPA also remains controversial. Previous reports have suggested that sympathetic neurons supply DOPA to the circulation (21Grossman E. Hoffman A. Armando L. Abassi Z. Kopin I.J. Goldstein D.S. Sympathoadrenal contribution to plasma dopa (3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine) in rats.Clin. Sci. 1992; 83: 65-74Crossref Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Another study indicated that sympathectomy through an abdominal incision did not affect muscle and arterial plasma DOPA levels (22Eldrup E. Richter E.A. Christensen N.J. DOPA, norepinephrine, and dopamine in rat tissues: No effect of sympathectomy on muscle DOPA.Am. J. Physiol. Endocrinol. Metab. 1989; 256: E284-E287Crossref Google Scholar). To solve these issues, we conducted the present experiments to evaluate the intrinsically synthesized DA in each tissue after ablation of the Th gene in the sympathoadrenal system. We generated mice in which the Th gene can be ablated at adulthood in the sympathoadrenal system using a dopamine β-hydroxylase (DBH) promoter, which had been used for expression of transgenes in the sympathoadrenal system (23Sumi-Ichinose C. Urano F. Shimomura A. Sato T. Ikemoto K. Shiraishi H. Senda T. Ichinose H. Nomura T.

Cell-specific expression from the human dopamine &hydroxylase promoter in transgenic mice is controlled via a combination of positive and negative regulatory elements.J. Neurosci. 1994; 4: 2455-2463Crossref Google Scholar). We assumed that if the nerve terminals of the sympathetic neurons are the major source of NA and DA in the tissue, the NA and DA contents should be decreased in parallel with the decreases in the TH protein levels in the mice. We also monitored the plasma DOPA levels because circulating DOPA can affect the DA production in APUD cells, and it is thought to be supplied from the sympathetic neurons (21Grossman E. Hoffman A. Armando L. Abassi Z. Kopin I.J. Goldstein D.S. Sympathoadrenal contribution to plasma dopa (3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine) in rats.Clin. Sci. 1992; 83: 65-74Crossref Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we performed immunohistochemical analyses and revealed that there were local TH- and AADC-expressing cells in the stomach and lung, whereas only AADC-expressing cells were present in the kidney. Our results clarified the systemic differences in the DA metabolism among peripheral tissues in vivo for the first time. DBH, the enzyme catalyzing the conversion of DA into NA, is selectively expressed in noradrenergic neurons and the adrenal medulla. To generate spatiotemporally-controlled somatic mutations of Th in DBH-expressing cells, we generated DBH Cre-ERT2 mice that express the tamoxifen (TAM)-dependent Cre-ERT2 recombinase (25Indra A.K. Warot X. Brocard J. Bornert J.-M. Xiao J.-H. Chambon P. Metzger D. Temporally-controlled site-specific mutagenesis in the basal layer of the epidermis: Comparison of the recombinase activity of the tamoxifen-inducible Cre-ER T and Cre-ER T2 recombinases.Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 4324-4327Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar) under the control of the 5.8-kb promoter region of the human DBH gene and crossed them with floxed Th mice (Thfl/fl), in which exons 6 to 9 of the Th gene are flanked with loxP sites. Eight- to 12-week-old Thfl/fl and DBH Cre-ERT2/Thfl/fl mice were treated with TAM (Fujifilm-Wako) to generate Ctrl and conditional KO (cKO) mice (Fig. 1A), which were analyzed 2 or 4 weeks later (Fig. 1B). The TH expression was analyzed by immunohistochemistry. Whereas most cells were TH positive in the adrenal medulla of Ctrl mice, few TH-positive cells were detected in cKO mice at both 2 and 4 weeks after TAM injection (Fig. 2A). In contrast, AADC immunoreactivity did not decline, indicating that TH is selectively ablated in the adrenal medulla. We further examined the alteration in the TH protein in the sympathetic neurons of the heart (Fig. 2B). The TH-positive nerve bundle was thinner in the cKO mice than in Ctrl mice (Fig. 2B, arrow). In addition, we confirmed that the TH protein levels were not affected in cKO mice before TAM injection by Western blot analysis (Fig. S1A). To confirm tissue-specific recombination in cKO mice, we examined Th recombination in tissues at 4 weeks after TAM injection by PCR. As shown in Figure S1B, recombined Th alleles were detected in the DNAs extracted from the adrenal gland and superior cervical ganglion, where the sympathetic neuronal soma are located. Such alleles were also detected in the lung and weakly in the heart. Immunostaining of lung sections with anti-TH antibodies revealed similar patterns in cKO and Ctrl mice, showing that TH-positive cells in the lung were not affected in cKO mice (Fig. S1C). Thus, we successfully generated mice in which the Th gene is selectively ablated in the sympathoadrenal system after TAM injection. We next examined the TH protein levels by Western blot analyses and measured the catecholamine (CA) contents in the tissues at 2 or 4 weeks after TAM injection. The TH levels in the adrenal gland were fivefold lower in cKO mice than in Ctrl mice at both 2 and 4 weeks after TAM injection (Fig. 3A). CA levels in the adrenal glands of cKO mice showed distinct profiles. DA in cKO mice was decreased to approximately 15% compared with Ctrl mice at both 2 and 4 weeks (287 ± 27 versus 47 ± 3 pmol/adrenal gland at 2 weeks [p < 0.001] and 265 ± 20 versus 33 ± 4 pmol/adrenal gland at 4 weeks [p < 0.001] in Ctrl and cKO mice, respectively) (Fig. 3B). Because DA is an intermediate metabolite that produces NA and adrenaline (AD) in the adrenal gland, the parallel decreases in the DA contents with those of TH protein indicated that the TH activity in the adrenal gland was decreased to 15 to 20% of Ctrl in cKO mice. In contrast, the decreases in NA levels were only approximately 60% at both 2 and 4 weeks (7.19 ± 0.36 versus 4.46 ± 0.23 nmol/adrenal gland at 2 weeks [p < 0.001] and 7.48 ± 0.41 versus 4.25 ± 0.22 nmol/adrenal gland at 4 weeks [p < 0.001] in Ctrl and cKO mice, respectively) (Fig. 3C), and the AD level in cKO mice was 59% of that in Ctrl mice at 2 weeks and further decreased to 27% at 4 weeks (16.68 ± 0.89 versus 9.84 ± 0.78 nmol/adrenal gland at 2 weeks [p < 0.001] and 17.56 ± 1.35 versus 4.82 ± 0.34 nmol/adrenal at 4 weeks [p < 0.001] in Ctrl and cKO mice, respectively) (Fig. 3D). The aforementioned experiments show that the TH gene was deleted in sympathetic noradrenergic neurons and the adrenal medulla after TAM injection. Although we presumed that sympathetic neurons release DOPA into the circulation, the plasma DOPA levels of cKO mice were comparable to those of Ctrl mice at both 2 and 4 weeks after TAM injection (Fig. 4A). This result indicates that sympathetic neurons are not the main source of DOPA in plasma. In contrast, the mean NA and AD contents in plasma of cKO mice were decreased to approximately 20 to 70% compared with those of Ctrl mice, but these differences were not statistically significant because of large variation (Fig. 4, B and C). These plasma CA reductions may reflect the reduction of TH activity in the sympathoadrenal system. The concentrations of DA in plasma were one-tenth of those of NA and AD and below the detection limit for some samples (Fig. 4D). Even though we did not observe a significant alteration in the DA content in cKO mice, the levels of dihydroxyphenylacetic acid, a metabolite of DA, were significantly decreased in cKO mice to approximately 50% compared with Ctrl mice (11.05 ± 0.77 versus 5.28 ± 0.47 pmol/ml plasma at 2 weeks [p = 0.0103] and 12.98 ± 1.99 versus 5.5 ± 0.46 pmol/ml plasma at 4 weeks [p = 0.0011] in Ctrl and cKO mice, respectively) (Fig. 4E). The TH protein levels in heart and pancreas of cKO mice were significantly decreased to approximately 20% compared with Ctrl mice at both 2 and 4 weeks after TAM injection (Fig. 5, A and B). They were decreased to approximately 40 to 60% in the stomach, lung, and spleen of cKO mice compared with that in Ctrl mice, even though it did not reach statistical significance (Fig. 5, C–E), and unaffected in the kidney (Fig. 5F). The NA contents in the heart and pancreas were significantly reduced in cKO mice compared with Ctrl mice to approximately 30 to 50%, correlating with the decreases in the TH protein levels (Fig. 5, G and H). In other tissues, there was little or no decline in the NA levels in cKO mice, whereas the NA levels in the stomach and kidney at 4 weeks after TAM injection were reduced to approximately 70% of those in Ctrl mice (Fig. 5, I–L). By plotting the NA levels against the TH protein levels (Fig. 5, M–R), a strong correlation of the NA and TH protein levels was observed in the heart and pancreas (r = 0.99, p < 0.001 in the heart; and r = 0.85, p = 0.003 in the pancreas; Fig. 5, M and N), a weak correlation in the stomach, lung, and spleen (r = 0.597, p = 0.069 in the stomach; r = 0.686, p = 0.285 in the lung; and r = 0.723, p = 0.018 in the spleen; Fig. 5, O–Q), and no correlation in the kidney (r = 0.152, p = 0.676; Fig. 5R). The good correlation between the NA and TH protein levels in the heart and pancreas suggests that most of the TH protein and NA in the tissues are derived from the nerve terminals of the sympathetic neurons. In other tissues, as only a weak or no correlation between the TH and NA levels was observed, it suggests the presence of endogenous TH-expressing cells and/or cells taking up and storing NA from circulating blood through NA transporters in these organs. Figure 6 summarizes the DOPA and DA contents in the peripheral organs. DOPA concentrations were not decreased after TAM injection in the examined tissues (Fig. 6, A–F). However, the contents of DOPA varied between organs: approximately 4 to 8 pmol/mg protein in the stomach, lung, and spleen, and approximately 1 pmol/mg protein in the heart, pancreas, and kidney (Fig. 6, A–F), indicating that the tissue DOPA levels were controlled by mechanisms other than the concentration of DOPA in the plasma. DA contents in the heart and pancreas of cKO mice were decreased to approximately 30 and 40% of Ctrl mice, respectively (Fig. 6, G and H), but the DA contents in the kidney, lung, spleen, and stomach of cKO mice showed less or no change in comparison to Ctrl mice (Fig. 6, I–L). These data suggest that DA in the heart and pancreas is mainly derived from sympathetic neurons, whereas DA in the kidney, lung, spleen, and stomach is derived from DOPA in the plasma and/or from DOPA synthesized by TH-expressing cells in the organ. We plotted the tissue NA levels against the tissue DA levels (Fig. 7, A–F). DA in peripheral tissues corresponds to DA synthesized in sympathetic neurons and in the endogenous tissue DA. Because we genetically ablated Th in sympathetic neurons, DA was considered to be synthesized in endogenous cells and sympathetic neurons when the correlation between NA and DA was low. As shown in Figure 7, NA and DA in the heart, pancreas, and lung showed strong correlations (r = 0.956, p < 0.001 in the heart; r = 0.913, p < 0.001 in the pancreas; and r = 0.789, p < 0.001 in the lung; Fig. 7, A, B, and D). Moreover, NA and DA in the stomach and spleen showed moderate correlations (r = 0.603, p = 0.005 in the stomach; and r = 0.616, p = 0.004 in the spleen; Fig. 7, C and E), and NA and DA in the kidney showed weak correlations (r = 0.304, p = 0.193; Fig. 7F). These results indicate that DA is not mainly synthesized in the sympathetic neurons in the stomach, spleen, and kidney. We analyzed the correlation of tissue DOPA and DA with plasma DOPA to confirm whether tissue DA was dependent on the levels of DOPA in the plasma (Fig. 7, G–R). There were moderate correlations in the kidney and stomach (r = 0.629, p = 0.003 in the kidney and r = 0.534, p = 0.015 in the stomach; Fig. 7, I and L), whereas no correlation was observed in the heart, pancreas, lung, and spleen (Fig. 7, G, H, J, and K). In addition, the correlation of tissue DOPA and plasma DOPA in each organ was tested. Only the kidney showed a strong correlation (r = 0.686, p < 0.001; Fig. 7R). The significant correlation of the DOPA and DA contents in the kidney with the DOPA concentration in the plasma suggests that DA in the kidney is derived from circulating DOPA. Finally, we investigated the distribution of TH and AADC by immunohistochemistry in the stomach, lung, and kidney, which showed less correlation of DA and NA (Fig. 7, C, D, and F), to evaluate whether DA can be synthesized from tyrosine and/or circulating DOPA. Because the dopamine D1 receptor (D1R) plays an important role in DA function in these peripheral tissues (10Xu P. Gildea J.J. Zhang C. Konkalmatt P. Cuevas S. Wang D.B. Tran H.T. Jose P.A.

TH and AADC were immunodetected in the corpus mucosa of the stomach; however, X-gal staining was sparsely detected in the muscularis externa but not in TH- and AADC-positive cells (Fig. 8, A and B). D1R-positive cells in the muscularis externa may be involved in gastric motility, which has been reported to be modulated by DA (31Zheng L.-F. Song J. Fan R.-F. Chen C.-L. Ren Q.-Z. Zhang X.-L. Feng X.-Y. Zhang Y. Li L.-S. Zhu J.-X.

In the lung, immunoreactivities of TH and AADC were detected in the epithelial cells of the airway. However, X-gal staining was not detected in TH- and AADC-immunoreactive cells, but it was observed around the blood vessels (Fig. 8C). TH and AADC were localized on the cell surface of airway epithelial cells compared with the counterstained slices with hematoxylin (Fig. 8D). In the kidney, TH was not stained, whereas AADC was immunoreactive in the outer medulla (Fig. 8E). No X-gal staining was detected in either the cortex or medulla of the kidney. In this study, we examined alterations in TH expression and quantified the concentrations of DOPA, DA, and NA in the heart, pancreas, stomach, lung, spleen, and kidney of mice in which the Th gene was selectively ablated in the sympathoadrenal system. It is striking that ablation of TH in the adrenal gland affects DA much more than NA and AD (Fig. 3). NA and AD are stored in chromaffin granules and large intracellular vesicles, and NA and AD can be recycled from circulating blood through the NA transporters SLC6A2 (32Cleary S. Brouwers F.M. Eisenhofer G. Pacak K. Christie D.L. Lipski J. McNeil A.R. Phillips J.K.

The role of neuronal and extraneuronal plasma membrane transporters in the inactivation of peripheral catecholamines.Pharmacol. Ther. 2001; 91: 35-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Although DA is also a substrate of the NA transporter, circulating DA concentrations are less than one-tenth of those of NA and AD (Fig. 4). Therefore, the slower declines in the NA and AD levels may be attributed to the action of the NA transporter and might account for the slower turnover rate of these CAs in the adrenal gland (34Lee K. Miwa S. Fujiwara M. Magaribuchi T. Fujiwara M. Differential effects of hypoxia on the turnover of norepinephrine and epinephrine in the heart, adrenal gland, submaxillary gland and stomach.J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1987; 240: 954-958PubMed Google Scholar). Plasma DOPA levels were not reduced at either 2 or 4 weeks after TAM injection, although the TH protein levels were greatly decreased in the sympathoadrenal system (Fig. 4A). These results suggest that the sympathetic nervous system and adrenal medulla should not be the direct sources of DOPA in the plasma. Previous reports have suggested that sympathetic neurons supply DOPA to the circulation by the experiments of 6-hydroxydopamine administration (21Grossman E. Hoffman A. Armando L. Abassi Z.

https://openalex.org/W3138050306,"The distribution of signaling molecules following mechanical or chemical stimulation of a cell defines cell polarization, with regions of high active Cdc42 at the front and low active Cdc42 at the rear. As reaction-diffusion phenomena between signaling molecules, such as Rho GTPases, define the gradient dynamics, we hypothesize that the cell shape influences the maintenance of the ""front-to-back"" cell polarization patterns. We investigated the influence of cell shape on the Cdc42 patterns using an established computational polarization model. Our simulation results showed that not only cell shape but also Cdc42 and Rho-related (in)activation parameter values affected the distribution of active Cdc42. Despite an initial Cdc42 gradient, the in silico results showed that the maximal Cdc42 concentration shifts in the opposite direction, a phenomenon we propose to call ""reverse polarization"". Additional in silico analyses indicated that ""reverse polarization"" only occurred in a particular parameter value space that resulted in a balance between inactivation and activation of Rho GTPases. Future work should focus on a mathematical description of the underpinnings of reverse polarization, in combination with experimental validation using, for example, dedicated FRET-probes to spatiotemporally track Rho GTPase patterns in migrating cells. In summary, the findings of this study enhance our understanding of the role of cell shape in intracellular signaling."
https://openalex.org/W3138428538,"Glioma is a lethal malignant brain cancer, and many reports have shown that abnormalities in the behavior of water and ion channels play an important role in regulating tumor proliferation, migration, apoptosis, and differentiation. Recently, new studies have suggested that some long noncoding RNAs containing small open reading frames can encode small peptides and form oligomers for water or ion regulation. However, because the peptides are difficult to identify, their functional mechanisms are far from being clearly understood. In this study, we used bioinformatics methods to identify and evaluate lncRNAs, which may encode small transmembrane peptides in gliomas. Combining ab initio homology modeling, molecular dynamics simulations, and free energy calculations, we constructed a predictive model and predicted the oligomer channel activity of peptides by identifying the lncRNA ORFs. We found that one key hub lncRNA, namely, DLEU1, which contains two smORFs (ORF1 and ORF8), encodes small peptides that form pentameric channels. The mechanics of water and ion (Na + and Cl - ) transport through this pentameric channel were simulated. The potential mean force of the H 2 O molecules along the two ORF-encoded peptide channels indicated that the energy barrier was different between ORF1 and ORF8. The ORF1-encoded peptide pentamer acted as a self-assembled water channel but not as an ion channel, and the ORF8 permeated neither ions nor water. This work provides new methods and theoretical support for further elucidation of the function of lncRNA-encoded small peptides and their role in cancer. Additionally, this study provides a theoretical basis for drug development."
https://openalex.org/W3136023788,"Purpose Regional-level measures can complement national antimicrobial stewardship programs. In Japan, sub-prefectural regions called secondary medical areas (SMAs) provide general inpatient care within their borders, and regional antimicrobial stewardship measures are frequently implemented at this level. There is therefore a need to conduct antimicrobial use (AMU) surveillance at this level to ascertain antimicrobial consumption. However, AMU estimates are generally standardized to residence-based nighttime populations, which do not account for population mobility across regional borders. We examined the impact of population in/outflow on SMA-level AMU estimates by comparing the differences between standardization using daytime and nighttime populations. Methods We obtained AMU information from the National Database of Health Insurance Claims and Specific Health Checkups of Japan. AMU was quantified at the prefectural and SMA levels using the number of defined daily doses (DDDs) divided by (a) 1,000 nighttime population per day or (b) 1,000 daytime population per day. We identified and characterized the discrepancies between the two types of estimates at the prefectural and SMA levels. Results The national AMU was 17.21 DDDs per 1,000 population per day. The mean (95% confidence interval) prefectural-level DDDs per 1,000 nighttime and daytime population per day were 17.27 (14.10, 20.44) and 17.41 (14.30, 20.53), respectively. The mean (95% confidence interval) SMA-level DDDs per 1,000 nighttime and daytime population per day were 16.12 (9.84, 22.41) and 16.41 (10.57, 22.26), respectively. The nighttime population-standardized estimates were generally higher than the daytime population-standardized estimates in urban areas, but lower in the adjacent suburbs. Large differences were observed in the main metropolitan hubs in eastern and western Japan. Conclusion Regional-level AMU estimates, especially of smaller regions such as SMAs, are susceptible to the use of different populations for standardization. This finding indicates that AMU standardization based on population values is not suitable for AMU estimates in small regions."

Although P . dasymallus is listed as VU (vulnerable) in the IUCN Red List, only few genetic works have been conducted to support its conservation. In this study we analyzed 19 markers (mtDNA haplotypes and 18 microsatellite markers) to evaluate genetic diversity and investigate the genetic structure of this species. mtDNA analysis was conducted with 142 DNA remote samples, mostly from faeces, and wing tissues collected on eight islands (Miyako, Ishigaki, Kohama, Kuroshima, Hateruma, Taketomi, Iriomote, Yonaguni). 39 haplotypes were identified in 526bp of the control region, and haplotype network showed no clear genetic structure. Microsatellite analysis was also conducted with 155 samples collected on six islands (Miyako, Ishigaki, Kohama, Taketomi, Iriomote, Yonaguni). It showed that the Yonaguni population exhibits low genetic diversity, high inbreeding, and clear genetic differentiation from other populations. Gene flow between Ishigaki and Miyako through small stepstone islands might be preventing inbreeding of the Miyako population. We provide for the first time indirect proof of long-distance inter-island dispersal in the Ryukyu flying fox and revealed genetic diversity, gene flow and genetic differentiation among the archipelago’s populations. These results will be useful for delineating conservation units and designing specific conservation policies for each island based on metapopulation genetic structure."

Methods This was a retrospective cohort study of 791 cases of fetal CHD diagnosed by prenatal ultrasound from January 2005 to April 2018. Associated ECAs included extracardiac structural malformation (ECM), chromosomal anomaly, and 22q11.2 microdeletion. CHD was classified into 10 groups according to a modified anatomic and clinical classification of congenital heart defects. Results The overall prevalence of ECA in our CHD cohort was 28.6% (226/791): ECM, 25.3%; chromosomal anomaly, 11.7%; and 22q11.2 microdeletion, 5.5%. For those with ECM, ventricular septal defect (VSD) had the highest prevalence (34.5%), followed by anomalies of atrioventricular junctions and valves (28.8%) and heterotaxy (26.9%). For those with chromosomal anomaly, anomalies of atrioventricular junctions and valves had the highest prevalence (37.5%), followed by anomalies of atria and interatrial communications (25.0%) and VSD (22.9%). 22q11.2 microdeletion was detected only in those with anomalies of extrapericardial arterial trunks (14.3%) or ventricular outflow tracts (6.4%).

This study investigated the association between self-help group membership and depressive symptoms among people living with HIV in Yangon, Myanmar. Methods In this cross-sectional study, data were collected from people living with HIV at three antiretroviral therapy clinics in 2017. Multiple logistic regression analyses were carried out to examine the associations between having self-help group membership and depressive symptoms. Three ART clinics were purposively selected based on the recommendation from the National AIDS Program in Myanmar. At these clinics, people living with HIV were recruited by a convenience sampling method. Results Among people living with HIV recruited in this study (n = 464), 201 (43.3%) were members of a self-help group. The membership was not associated with having depressive symptoms (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 1.59, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.98–2.59). Factors associated with having depressive symptoms were female (AOR 3.70, 95% CI 1.54–8.88) and lack of social support (AOR 0.97, 95% CI 0.96–0.98) among self-help group members, and female (AOR 3.47, 95% CI 1.70–7.09), lack of social support (AOR 0.98, 95% CI 0.97–0.99), and internalized stigma (AOR 1.28, 95% 1.08–1.53) among non-members. Conclusions This study did not find evidence on the association between membership in self-help groups and depressive symptoms among people living with HIV. Social support was a protective factor against depressive symptoms both self-help group members and non-members, although the level of social support was lower among members than non-members. The activities of self-help groups and care provided by the ART clinics should be strengthened to address mental health problems among people living with HIV in the study site."

These aquatic oases provide shelter, water, nutrients and resting of aggregation sites for several aquatic organisms, among them crustaceans. However, in comparison with the multitude of studies on open aquatic systems, our knowledge on crustaceans inhabiting semi-terrestrial habitats and phytotelmata is limited and their presence in such environments is poorly understood. The present study was carried out in two natural protected areas of the Yucatán Peninsula aiming to understand the diversity and dispersal strategies of crustaceans living in bromeliads. Sediment and water contained in four species of bromeliads have been collected in order to understand the diversity and dispersal strategies of crustaceans living in such habitats. From a total of 238 bromeliads surveyed, 55% were colonized by crustaceans. Sixteen copepod, three ostracod and one branchiopod species were recorded during this study, however only seven species are considered as true bromeliad inhabitants. Different degrees of association between crustaceans and bromeliad species were assessed with an indicator species analysis, where significant associations were found for all crustaceans. We found significant differences between bromeliad species and reserves and their associated fauna. In order to analyze the genetic diversity of this fauna, we sequenced several individuals of each species with two genetic markers (18S rRNA and COI mtDNA). Bayesian analyses and the Generalized Mixed Yule Coalescent method (GMYC), delimited 7 well supported species. A comparison of the dispersal strategies used by different species, including passive dispersal, phoretic behavior and active dispersal, is included. This study stresses the need of studying meiofauna of phytotelms, which could be used as an indicator of local diversity in Neotropical forests."
https://openalex.org/W3136081347,"Industry-led culling of badgers has occurred in England to reduce the incidence of bovine tuberculosis in cattle for a number of years. Badger vaccination is also possible, and a move away from culling was ""highly desirable"" in a recent report to the UK government. Here we used an established simulation model to examine badger control option in a post-cull environment in England. These options included no control, various intermittent culling, badger vaccination and use of a vaccine combined with fertility control. The initial simulated cull led to a dramatic reduction in the number of infected badgers present, which increased slowly if there was no further badger management. All three approaches led to a further reduction in the number of infected badgers, with little to choose between the strategies. We do note that of the management strategies only vaccination on its own leads to a recovery of the badger population, but also an increase in the number of badgers that need to be vaccinated. We conclude that vaccination post-cull, appears to be particularly effective, compared to vaccination when the host population is at carrying capacity."

Using data from the Menstrual Disorder of Teenagers Survey (administered in 2005 and 2016), we propose a Gaussian copula model with graphical lasso prior to identify cohort differences in menstrual characteristics and to predict endometriosis. The model includes random effects to account for clustering by school, and we use the extended rank likelihood copula model to handle variables of mixed-type. The graphical lasso prior shrinks the elements in the precision matrix of a Gaussian distribution to encourage a sparse graphical structure, where the level of shrinkage is adaptable based on the strength of the conditional associations among questions in the survey. Applying our proposed model to the menstrual disorder data set, we found that menstrual disturbance was more pronouncedly reported over a decade, and we found some empirical differences between those girls with higher risk of developing endometriosis and the general population."

This study explored the experiences of the parents and HCPs about the end-of-life care and breaking bad news and related positive and negative factors in Indian context. Methods This qualitative exploratory study was conducted at paediatrics department of a tertiary care hospital in Delhi. In-depth interviews with the parents (n = 49) and family members (n = 21) of the children died at the hospital and HCPs (6 doctors, 6 nurses and 4 support staffs) were conducted. Also events and communication around death of eight children were observed. Data were inductively analysed using thematic content analysis method to identify emerging themes and codes. Results Doctors were the lead communicators. Majority of parents perceived the attitude, communication and language used as by resident doctors as brief, insensitive and sometimes inappropriate or negative. They perceived that the attitude and communication by senior doctor’s as empathetic, positive and complete. Parents recalled the death declaration by resident doctors as non-empathetic, blunt and cold. Most parents received no emotional support from HCPs during and after death of their child. All doctors expressed that death of their patients affected them and their emotions, which they coped through different activities. The overcrowded wards, high workload, infrastructural limitation and no formal communication training added to the emotional stress of the HCPs. Conclusions Majority of the communication by the HCPs during the hospitalisation and end-of-life period were perceived as suboptimal by the parents. The HCPs were emotionally affected and faced end-of-life communication challenges. The study highlights the communication by HCPs and support for parents during the end-of-life communication and breaking bad news. It suggests adoption of context specific communication protocol and materials and training of HCPs in communication to improve the quality of care."
https://openalex.org/W3138235530,"In real world situations, decision makers prefer to have multiple optimal solutions before making a final decision. Aiming to help the decision makers even if they are non-experts in optimization algorithms, this study proposes a new and simple multimodal optimization (MMO) algorithm called the gravitational particle swarm algorithm (GPSA). Our GPSA is developed based on the concept of ""particle clustering in the absence of clustering procedures"". Specifically, it simply replaces the global feedback term in classical particle swarm optimization (PSO) with an inverse-square gravitational force term between the particles. The gravitational force mutually attracts and repels the particles, enabling them to autonomously and dynamically generate sub-swarms in the absence of algorithmic clustering procedures. Most of the sub-swarms gather at the nearby global optima, but a small number of particles reach the distant optima. The niching behavior of our GPSA was tested first on simple MMO problems, and then on twenty MMO benchmark functions. The performance indices (peak ratio and success rate) of our GPSA were compared with those of existing niching PSOs (ring-topology PSO and fitness Euclidean-distance ratio PSO). The basic performance of our GPSA was comparable to that of the existing methods. Furthermore, an improved GPSA with a dynamic parameter delivered significantly superior results to the existing methods on at least 60% of the tested benchmark functions."
https://openalex.org/W3138452157,"The study was conducted in the raised bog Kusowo (Baltic region, West Pomerania, Poland). Along a transect line crossing two open mires affected by forest succession we analysed tree age distribution. One of those mires had been drained in the past years and still retained some open ditches, while the other one was located far from the ditches. Every 10 meters along the transect line one tree was drilled at the root collar in order to determine its age. We also conducted phytosociological analyses and short-term water level measurements in the sample plots. We expected faster tree encroachment in the undisturbed part of the open mire. The results showed, that there were no significant differences in water table level and in soil moisture indicator values between the formerly drained and undisturbed open mire. There were also no statistically significant differences in tree encroachment between the disturbed and undisturbed mires. Location and the age distribution of the trees suggest that changes in the tree growth conditions cannot be directly explained by the general decreasing of water level in the bog, although periods following drainage works were associated with more numerous establishment of young trees, in the drained part of the bog as well as in the part not directly affected by drainage ditches."
https://openalex.org/W3138989626,"Veteran hollow trees are keystone structures in ecosystems and provide important habitat for a diverse set of organisms, many of which are involved in the process of decomposition. Since veteran trees are ‘islands’ of high biodiversity, they provide a unique system in which to study the relationship between biodiversity and decomposition of wood. We tested this relationship with a balanced experiential design, where we quantified the taxonomic and functional diversity of beetles directly involved in the process of decomposing wood, and measured the decomposition of experimentally added bundles of small diameter wood around 20 veteran trees and 20 nearby young trees in southern Norway. We found that the diversity (both taxonomic and functional) of wood-decomposing beetles was significantly higher around the veteran trees, and beetle communities around veteran trees consisted of species with a greater preference for larger diameter wood. We extracted few beetles from the experimentally added wood bundles, regardless of the tree type that they were placed near, but decomposition rates were significantly lower around veteran trees. We speculate that slower decomposition rates around veteran trees could have been a result of a greater diversity of competing fungi, which has been found to decrease decay rates. Veteran trees provide an ecological legacy within anthropogenic landscapes, enhance biodiversity and influence wood decomposition. Actions to protect veteran trees are urgently needed in order to save these valuable organisms and their associated biodiversity."
https://openalex.org/W3138667397,"Background It is unclear if a local audit would be useful in providing guidance on how to improve local practice of empiric antibiotic therapy. We performed an audit of antibiotic therapy in bacteremia to evaluate the proportion and risk factors for inadequate empiric antibiotic coverage. Methods This retrospective cohort study included patients with positive blood cultures across 3 hospitals in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada during October of 2019. Antibiotic therapy was considered empiric if it was administered within 24 hours after blood culture collection. Adequate coverage was defined as when the isolate from blood culture was tested to be susceptible to the empiric antibiotic. A multivariable logistic regression model was used to predict inadequate empiric coverage. Diagnostic accuracy of a clinical pathway based on patient risk factors was compared to clinician’s decision in predicting which bacteria to empirically cover. Results Of 201 bacteremia cases, empiric coverage was inadequate in 56 (27.9%) cases. Risk factors for inadequate empiric coverage included unknown source at initiation of antibiotic therapy (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) of 2.76 95% CI 1.27–6.01, P = 0.010) and prior antibiotic therapy within 90 days (aOR of 2.46 95% CI 1.30–4.74, P = 0.006). A clinical pathway that considered community-associated infection as low risk for Pseudomonas was better at ruling out Pseudomonas bacteremia with a negative likelihood ratio of 0.17 (95% CI 0.03–1.10) compared to clinician’s decision with negative likelihood ratio of 0.34 (95% CI 0.10–1.22).

Twenty-five viewpoints were selected for the q-sample. In the second phase, 99 respondents ranked these viewpoints according to an a priori quasi normal distribution ranging from +4 (most agree) to -4 (least agree). Factor analysis was combined with comments provided by survey respondents to label and describe the extracted factors.The factor labels were hoping and caring (factor 1), pragmatic progress (factor 2), and cautious/conservative and protectionist (factor 3). Factor 1 describes a viewpoint of unequivocal support for medical cannabis research in this population with few caveats. Factor 2 describes a viewpoint of cautious support with a need to monitor for unintended adverse effects. Factor 3 describes a viewpoint of ensuring that current analgosedation techniques are optimized before exposing patients to another potentially harmful drug.Using a q-methodology design, we were able to sample and describe the viewpoints that exist about medical cannabis research in critically ill patients. Three factors emerged that seemed to adequately describe the relative ranking of q-statements by the majority of respondents. Combining the distinguishing statements along with respondent comments allowed us to determine that the majority support medical cannabis research in critically ill patients."

Our paper—which I had written during lockdown based on labwork I completed before the pandemic—had just been accepted for publication. “Great!” I responded. And that was that. I went back to cleaning my apartment and waiting for bread to bake. My city's lockdown made celebrating with co-workers at pub trivia or group drinks impossible. The only person who was going to celebrate this accomplishment with me was me—and I didn't feel like celebrating.



> “Publishing in isolation … gave me a chance to reflect on what I truly find rewarding.” 

If you had asked me at the beginning of my Ph.D. what I wanted to do after graduating, I would have said that I wanted to hide away at a fume hood and do research. If the pandemic hadn't hit I probably would have blithely remained on that track, carried along by the momentum of my expectations for myself and my future. The cheers of labmates and colleagues when I published that paper would have spurred me forward.

But publishing in isolation, with no celebrations, gave me a chance to reflect on what I truly find rewarding. The paper gave me little sense of personal or professional accomplishment. I realized I don't find satisfaction just from the act of research. In the words of organization expert Marie Kondo, it doesn't “spark joy.” Where did that leave me?

I had more than a year of my Ph.D. left. The prospect of working at something I no longer enjoyed, for a goal I was no longer excited about, was discouraging. “Get a Ph.D.” had turned out to be less of a career plan and more of a single step toward something unclear. I no longer knew what my career trajectory ought to be. I had been getting emails about university-sponsored graduate student career workshops every week for years. Like most people I knew, I figured I had better ways to use my time. Now, feeling aimless and uncertain about my future, I thought I would give them a try.

When I attended my first (virtual) event in November, I was a little discouraged at first to see it was mostly first-year graduate students who were already thinking about their career plans and how to optimize their grad school experiences accordingly. I felt late to the party, and somewhat regretful I hadn't taken advantage of these resources earlier. But I told myself late is better than never and that there was still lots I could learn.

As part of the workshop we completed an Individual Development Plan (IDP), a sort of quiz that helps you rank your career values and priorities. I had last taken a career quiz in high school. It told me to pursue marketing or vending machine repair, so I was fairly skeptical going in. When I got my results, I was surprised at first to see that “teamwork” and “help society” ended up as my top career essentials. But when I thought more about what I found fulfilling over the previous year, this began to make sense. I realized that I'll remember the people—the graduate students and other researchers I met and got to work with. I'll remember painstakingly going back and forth with my supervisor to craft a manuscript we were both happy with. For me, collaboration sparked joy.

The IDP suggested careers in public policy or administration. The prospect of leaving research was scary. But if the major research milestone of publishing a paper wasn't fulfilling for me, I needed to look elsewhere. So, rather than start new research projects, I've begun to write my thesis earlier than I planned, aiming to apply for a science policy fellowship in the fall. I've started to do something I previously associated only with business students and career professionals: networking with past collaborators and professors.

I wish it hadn't taken a global catastrophe for me to find my way to what I hope will be a rewarding career path. Yet if COVID-19 hadn't happened, I expect I would still be going full-steam ahead on research and would have realized far too late that I was on the wrong path. Going forward, I hope I can make a routine of regularly reflecting on what sparks joy—without waiting for a crisis."
