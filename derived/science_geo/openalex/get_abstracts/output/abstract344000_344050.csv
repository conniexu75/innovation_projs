https://openalex.org/W2003993202,"Concentration distributions of air contaminants and meteorological variables in New Jersey and New York for workdays (Mondays through Fridays, omitting holidays) and Sundays are compared by means of quantile-quantile plots. The ozone distributions are slightly higher on Sundays, and the primary pollutant distributions are lower. These results raise serious questions about the validity of current concepts underlying ozone reduction in urban atmospheres."
https://openalex.org/W2064846198,"Monte Alban was founded in period I (about 500 B.C.) probably by households from previously existing villages in the Valley of Oaxaca. There is some evidence for status variation in period I households, but more information is needed to determine its role in the early development of the city. During the millennium or more of urban growth at Monte Alban a change occurred in the organization of household space from an open outward-directed focus to a closed inward-directed one. This was accompanied by a formalization of household and interhousehold space and by a standardization in household sizes and burial treatment reflecting emergence of a social class hierarchy. These changes indicate development from a flexible to a highly structured society, which may be a general trend in urbanization."
https://openalex.org/W1965020044,"An array of 14 biaxial shallow-borehole tiltmeters (at 10-7 radian sensitivity) has been installed along 85 kilometers of the San Andreas fault during the past year. Earthquake-related changes in tilt have been simultaneously observed on up to four independent instruments. At earthquake distances greater than 10 earthquake source dimensions, there are few clear indications of tilt change. For the four instruments with the longest records (> 10 months), 26 earthquakes have occurred since July 1973 with at least one instrument closer than 10 source dimensions and 8 earthquakes with more than one instrument within that distance. Precursors in tilt direction have been observed before more than 10 earthquakes or groups of earthquakes, and no similar effect has yet been seen without the occurrence of an earthquake."

https://openalex.org/W2065667274,The ratio of the absorption coefficient to the backscatter coefficient for which heating and cooling effects due to aerosols exactly balance at the earth's surface has been calculated with the use of a radiative-convective atmospheric model. The results are compared with those obtained from several simpler mean radiative-transfer models.

https://openalex.org/W1995188104,"Jeffrey Mervis, in his article “Both sides point finger in tiff over China dig” (News & Comment, [1 Nov., p. 715][1]) about a conflict between Chinese and American geoscientists working in western China, reports an unfortunate occurrence, from which readers might conclude that systemic impropriety on the part of Chinese scientists and institutions was to blame.

I do not presume to know the details of the incident, but I emphatically urge caution against generalizing that such incidents are characteristic of fieldwork in China or that they in any way typify relations between U.S. and Chinese scientists. I spent a month in China doing fieldwork at the same time (and, in fact, on a very similar subject) as Lucas, Geissman, and Molina-Garza, and I was fully and generously hosted by my Chinese colleagues. I did not spend one yuan. Both the individual scientists and the institutions I worked with were extremely gracious, and the trip was scientifically productive and enjoyable.

It would be wrong to impugn the Chinese scientific community on the basis of this unfortunate incident. Let us hope that an amicable and mutually satisfying resolution to this dispute can be found and that ongoing and future U.S.-Chinese collaborations will not be imperiled by escalation into inappropriate venues.

https://openalex.org/W1989130192,"I am glad that the Chinese scientific community finally succeeded in disclosing a case of plagiarism (News & Comment, [18 Oct., p. 337][1]). The case was an open secret, of which I became aware when I was conducting research in Beijing in early 1996. I talked with the two authors who disclosed the case in the Journal of Dialectics of Nature . From what I learned then, it appears that there was pressure not to publicly discuss the case. The article was first submitted to another journal for publication. I was told later by one of the authors that three journals declined to publish it.

I applaud the Chinese scientists for adhering to their upright attitude toward scientific research and, most important, to their independence from interference.
