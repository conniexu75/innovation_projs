https://openalex.org/W2090428689,"Pore-water nitrate concentrations in six pelagic eastern equatorial Atlantic cores increase from bottom water values (22 micromolar) to 40 micromolar at a depth of about 5 centimeters, then decrease to undetectable levels at depths as shallow as 40 centimeters. These nitrate concentrations and concentration gradients reflect zones of oxygen reduction, nitrate reduction, and sulfate reduction in the sediments. The estimated benthic flux of nitrate to the ocean from our data is much less than the total globalflux of nitrate to deep waters, even though these equatorial sediments underlie a productive upwelling zone. The estimated denitrification rate in our study area suggests that pelagic sediments may be important sites of marine denitrification."

Organic particles containing traces of aluminum, iron, silicon, and sulfur were predominant in the migrant material through the upper horizons (horizons A + B); their movement was arrested in the B2hir horizon. Below B2hir and at depth, phyllosilicates, quartz, and silicate minerals were the predominant suspended materials. Elements of the podzolic mechanism and the duality of the B2hir horizon are shown."

https://openalex.org/W2150127367,Surface imagery of ocean waves under Hurricane Gloria (September 1976) has been obtained with an airborne synthetic-aperture imaging radar. Observations were obtained over most of the area within a radius of 150 kilometers around the center of the eye. These direct observations made it possible to derive the wave patterns in the region around a hurricane eye.
https://openalex.org/W1994348835,"Charnockite, a hypersthene-bearing granite, and other associated rocks of the charnockite series have a global distribution. These rocks, according to evidence from mineral-chemical and experimental phase equilibrium relations, formed or recrystallized at temperatures between 800 degrees and 900 degrees C and at relatively shallow depths of 6 to 12 kilometers. This evidence indicates the existence of geothermal gradients of 70 degrees to 100 degrees C per kilometer probably at various times, the latest being around 1300 x 10(6) years ago."

Incubation of glands containing radiolabeled 3β-hydroxy-5α-cholestan-6-one results in the disappearance of this sterol from the glands and the concomitant appearance of radiolabeled α-ecdysone in the medium. The observations suggest that the sterol is an intermediate in the synthesis of α-ecdysone."
https://openalex.org/W1999983264,Measurement of individual culms of several salt-marsh plants demonstrates seasonal community change in terms of height increments and live and dead leaves. Tissue production and its ultimate transition from live to dead components and culm mortality all suggest a continuum of geratologic processes contributing to the estuarine ecosystem.

https://openalex.org/W2076649186,"1) Field operations should be conducted by trained field men with academic as well as field experience; this should insure the keeping of accurate records, and include clear comprehension of the problem under attack. 2) Supplies such as surveying instruments, cameras, tools, and storage and transportation facilities be available. The staff be given to experiment, cross-check records, and to do other such work. 3) Laboratory units should be conducted by trained technicians and pertinent allied sciences be brought to bear in order to insure the most complete and accurate analyses of material. 4) Accurate mapping of sites and environment, of vertical and horizontal records, and planned site nomenclature, are indispensable. 5) Methods of excavation must be conducted in a manner which promises to disclose all available evidence on formation and structure, and to preserve all data on stratigraphy, age, succession, cultural and historical activities and cultural processes. 6) All of the foregoing activities are nullified unless followed by prompt publication. Certainly every archaeologist will agree that all these are basic needs and indispensable to the serious attack of any problem in American prehistory, and that Dr Guthe has stated them clearly. However, upon reading the article I was struck by the fact that there is another basic need for which there is not as yet any solution. This is suggested by Dr Guthe in the sentence about the satisfactory applications of laboratory methods . . . to facilitate definition of types, cultural synthesis, and broad cultural comparisons. It may be of moment to elaborate upon this point. Is it possible for American archaeology ever to solve any broad problems in time succession, cultural and historical activities and cultural processes until it develops a common trait terminology, a common language concerning artifact types and the criteria by which they may be determined? Can cultural synthesis and broad cultural comparisons be achieved unless there is a general system by which the many workers in this field can be sure whether or not they are dealing with similar or dissimilar culture traits? Considering the time, energy, and money continually expended in excavating, in gathering greater and greater masses of specimens and more field data of every sort, it is a source of wonder that so little attention has been"

https://openalex.org/W1970359386,"Concave profiles of basalt hills in the Darling Downs area of southeastern Queensland can be cycloidal or exponential in form. Where the complete hillslope consists of shallow soils the form is cycloidal. Where colluvial lower slopes are present the overall slope is exponential but the upper, dominantly sedentary portion is cycloidal. The cycloidal form, which corresponds to the curve of least time, appears to be associated with erosional processes and the exponential form with depositional processes."

https://openalex.org/W2057097053,"A discussion of the use of coal in Texas in place of natural gas or oil, showed that the Houston Lighting and Power Co. (HLPC) was impelled by the rising price of natural gas to turn to other fuels. The company has a coal-fired plant under construction with two 660 Mw units due to come into service in 1978 and 1979. HLPC expects to add 750 Mw of nuclear-generated power to its system between 1982 and 1984. By 1990, HLPC plans to have 5300 Mw of coal-fired plant capacity and 2000 Mw of nuclear capacity, which amounts to an increase of about 70% of the present total of slightly more than 10,000 Mw capacity of gas-fired plants. However, HLPC expects continued economic development in the area to increase the demand for electricity so that all its plants will be needed. This runs counter to the Texas Railroad Commission's order to reduce the use of gas by 25% by 1985, compared with 1974-1975 levels. The City Public Service Board of San Antonio has experienced rises in the price of low-sulfur Wyoming coal and in the price for its transportation. Other aspects of the problem are also discussed, e.g., the increased usemore » of coal will cause additional air pollution, particularly with particulate matter, sulfur oxides, and nitrogen oxides.« less"
