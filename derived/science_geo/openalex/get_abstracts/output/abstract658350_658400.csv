https://openalex.org/W3080412139,"Background The role of maternal personality and perceived social support for peripartum changes in psychopathological symptoms remains unresolved. Methods In a regional-epidemiological sample of 306 women, depressive, anxiety, and stress symptoms were assessed three times during pregnancy and three times after delivery with the 21-item version of the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale. In pregnancy, the Big Five personality traits and perceived social support were assessed with the short version of the Big Five Inventory and the Social Support Questionnaire. Results Multilevel analyses revealed that depressive (b = -0.055) and stress (b = -0.047) symptoms decreased from early to late pregnancy. After delivery, anxiety symptoms were lower (two months postpartum: b = -0.193; four/ 16 months postpartum: b = -0.274), but stress symptoms were higher (two months postpartum: b = 0.468; four/ 16 months postpartum: b = 0.320) than during pregnancy. Across the peripartum period, more conscientious and more extraverted women experienced lower depressive and stress symptoms (b = -0.147 to -0.177), and more emotionally stable women experienced lower depressive, anxiety, and stress symptoms (b = -0.294 to -0.415). More emotionally stable women more strongly increased in anxiety during pregnancy (b = 0.019), and more extraverted women less strongly increased in depression after delivery (b = -0.010). Moreover, peripartum depressive, anxiety, and stress symptoms were lower in women with higher perceived social support (b = -0.225 to -0.308). Conclusions Less emotionally stable, less conscientious, and less extraverted women and women with lower perceived social support seem to be at increased risk for peripartum psychopathological symptoms and might thus particularly profit from targeted prevention."
https://openalex.org/W3080735827,"Current practice of assessing mood episodes in affective disorders largely depends on subjective observations combined with semi-structured clinical rating scales. Motor activity is an objective observation of the inner physiological state expressed in behavior patterns. Alterations of motor activity are essential features of bipolar and unipolar depression. The aim was to investigate if objective measures of motor activity can aid existing diagnostic practice, by applying machine-learning techniques to analyze activity patterns in depressed patients and healthy controls. Random Forrest, Deep Neural Network and Convolutional Neural Network algorithms were used to analyze 14 days of actigraph recorded motor activity from 23 depressed patients and 32 healthy controls. Statistical features analyzed in the dataset were mean activity, standard deviation of mean activity and proportion of zero activity. Various techniques to handle data imbalance were applied, and to ensure generalizability and avoid overfitting a Leave-One-User-Out validation strategy was utilized. All outcomes reports as measures of accuracy for binary tests. A Deep Neural Network combined with SMOTE class balancing technique performed a cut above the rest with a true positive rate of 0.82 (sensitivity) and a true negative rate of 0.84 (specificity). Accuracy was 0.84 and the Matthews Correlation Coefficient 0.65. Misclassifications appear related to data overlapping among the classes, so an appropriate future approach will be to compare mood states intra-individualistically. In summary, machine-learning techniques present promising abilities in discriminating between depressed patients and healthy controls in motor activity time series."
https://openalex.org/W3080444340,"Background Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide, with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounting for 85% of all lung cancer cases. Inflammation has been proven to be one of the characteristics of malignant tumors. Chronic inflammatory response mediated by cytokines in the tumor microenvironment is an important factor in tumorigenesis. The purpose of this study was to observe and evaluate the value of red blood cell distribution width (RDW), neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), and hemoglobin-to-red blood cell distribution width ratio (HRR) in the progression of NSCLC. Methods A total of 245 patients with NSCLC, 97 patients with benign pulmonary nodules, and 94 healthy volunteers were included in this study. Factors, such as age, gender, smoking history, histological type, lymph node metastasis, distant metastasis, TNM stage, and differentiation degree were statistically analyzed. The correlation of RDW, NLR, and HRR of patients with NSCLC with other clinical experimental parameters were also analyzed. Then, the diagnostic value of RDW, NLR, and HRR in the progression of NSCLC was evaluated. Results RDW, NLR, and HRR could be used to distinguish patients with NSCLC from healthy controls (p < 0.05). In addition, only the RDW in the NSCLC group with III-IV stage was significantly different from that in the benign pulmonary nodules group (p = 0.033), while NLR and HRR could significantly distinguish patients with NSCLC and benign pulmonary nodules (p < 0.001). RDW and NLR were positively correlated with NSCLC stage, whereas HRR was negatively correlated with NSCLC stage. RDW, NLR, and HRR were also significantly associated with the differentiation degree of NSCLC (p < 0.05). The ROC curve analysis showed that the combination of RDW with NLR, HRR, and CEA could show significantly higher diagnostic value than any one marker alone (AUC = 0.925, 95% CI: 0.897–0.954, and sensitivity and specificity of 79.60% and 93.60%, respectively). Conclusion RDW, NLR, and HRR can be utilized as simple and effective biomarkers for the diagnosis and evaluation of NSCLC progression."
https://openalex.org/W3080717938,"The PKA-inhibitor (PKI) family members PKIα, PKIβ, and PKIγ bind with high affinity to PKA and block its kinase activity, modulating the extent, and duration of PKA-mediated signaling events. While PKA is a well-known regulator of physiological and oncogenic events, the role of PKI proteins in these pathways has remained elusive. Here, by measuring activation of the MAPK pathway downstream of GPCR-Gαs-cAMP signaling, we show that the expression levels of PKI proteins can alter the balance of activation of two major cAMP targets: PKA and EPAC. Our results indicate that PKA maintains repressive control over MAPK signaling as well as a negative feedback on cAMP concentration. Overexpression of PKI and its subsequent repression of PKA dysregulates these signaling pathways, resulting in increased intracellular cAMP, and enhanced activation of EPAC and MAPK. We also find that amplifications of PKIA are common in prostate cancer and are associated with reduced progression free survival. Depletion of PKIA in prostate cancer cells leads to reduced migration, increased sensitivity to anoikis and reduced tumor growth. By altering PKA activity PKI can act as a molecular switch, driving GPCR-Gαs-cAMP signaling toward activation of EPAC-RAP1 and MAPK, ultimately modulating tumor growth."
https://openalex.org/W3080119533,"Parkinson disease is the most common neurodegenerative movement disorder, estimated to affect one in twenty-five individuals over the age of 80. Mutations in glucocerebrosidase 1 (GBA1) represent the most common genetic risk factor for Parkinson disease. The link between GBA1 mutations and α-synuclein accumulation, a hallmark of Parkinson disease, is not fully understood. Following our recent finding that Gba1 mutations lead to increased α-synuclein accumulation in mice, we have studied the effects of a single injection of mouse α-synuclein pre-formed fibrils into the striatum of Gba1 mice that carry a L444P knock-in mutation. We found significantly greater formation and spread of α-synuclein inclusions in Gba1-transgenic mice compared to wild-type controls. This indicates that the Gba1 L444P mutation accelerates α-synuclein pathology and spread."
https://openalex.org/W3081488138,"This study explores the motivational factors and barriers to participate in a citizen science program for malaria control in Rwanda. It assesses the changes in motivational factors over time and compares these factors among age and gender groups. Using a qualitative approach, this study involved 44 participants. At the initial stage, people participated in the program because of curiosity, desire to learn new things, helping others, and willingness to contribute to malaria control. As the engagement continued, other factors including ease of use of materials to report observations, the usefulness of the program, and recognition also played a crucial role in the retention of volunteers. Lack of time and information about the recruitment process, perceived low efficacy of the mosquito trap, and difficulties in collecting observations were reported as barriers to get and stay involved. Some variations in the motivational factors were observed among age and gender groups. At the initial phase, young adults and adults, as well as men and women were almost equally motivated to contribute to malaria control. For the ongoing phase, for age, the two groups were almost equally motivated by recognition of their effort. Also, the opportunity for learning was an important factor among young adults while ease of use of the materials was central for adults. For gender, the usefulness of the project, ease of use of materials, and learning opportunities were important motivational factors among women, while men were more motivated by recognition of their efforts. A framework including motivational factors and barriers at each stage of participation is presented. This framework may be used to explore motivations and barriers in future citizen science projects and might help coordinators of citizen science programs to determine whom to target, by which message, and at what stage of participation to retain volunteers in citizen science projects."
https://openalex.org/W3080176970,"Microbiome data consists of operational taxonomic unit (OTU) counts characterized by zero-inflation, over-dispersion, and grouping structure among samples. Currently, statistical testing methods are commonly performed to identify OTUs that are associated with a phenotype. The limitations of statistical testing methods include that the validity of p-values/q-values depend sensitively on the correctness of models and that the statistical significance does not necessarily imply predictivity. Predictive analysis using methods such as LASSO is an alternative approach for identifying associated OTUs and for measuring the predictability of the phenotype variable with OTUs and other covariate variables. We investigate three strategies of performing predictive analysis: (1) LASSO: fitting a LASSO multinomial logistic regression model to all OTU counts with specific transformation; (2) screening+GLM: screening OTUs with q-values returned by fitting a GLMM to each OTU, then fitting a GLM model using a subset of selected OTUs; (3) screening+LASSO: fitting a LASSO to a subset of OTUs selected with GLMM. We have conducted empirical studies using three simulation datasets generated using Dirichlet-multinomial models and a real gut microbiome data related to Parkinson’s disease to investigate the performance of the three strategies for predictive analysis. Our simulation studies show that the predictive performance of LASSO with appropriate variable transformation works remarkably well on zero-inflated data. Our results of real data analysis show that Parkinson’s disease can be predicted based on selected OTUs after the binary transformation, age, and sex with high accuracy (Error Rate = 0.199, AUC = 0.872, AUPRC = 0.912). These results provide strong evidences of the relationship between Parkinson’s disease and the gut microbiome."
https://openalex.org/W3081095609,"Background Underweight, overweight, and obesity are major public health challenges among reproductive-age women of lower- and middle-income countries (including Tanzania). In those settings, obesogenic factors (attributes that promote excessive body weight gain) are increasing in the context of an existing high burden of undernutrition. The present study investigated factors associated with underweight, overweight, and obesity among reproductive age women in Tanzania. Methods This study used 2015–16 Tanzania Demographic and Health Survey data (n = 11735). To account for the hierarchical nature of the data (i.e., reproductive age women nested within clusters), multilevel multinomial logistic regression models were used to investigate the association between individual-level (socioeconomic, demographic and behavioural) and community-level factors with underweight, overweight, and obesity. Results Reproductive age women who were informally employed (relative risk ratio [RRR] = 0.79; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.64, 0.96), those who were currently married (RRR = 0.59; 95% CI: 0.43, 0.82) and those who used contraceptives (RRR = 0.70; 95% CI: 0.54, 0.90) were less likely to be underweight. Reproductive age women who attained secondary or higher education (RRR = 1.48; 95% CI: 1.11, 1.96), those who resided in wealthier households (RRR = 2.31; 95% CI: 1.78, 3.03) and those who watched the television (RRR = 1.26; 95% CI: 1.06, 1.50) were more likely to be overweight. The risk of experiencing obesity was higher among reproductive age women who attained secondary or higher education (RRR = 1.79; 95% CI: 1.23, 2.61), those who were formally employed (RRR = 1.50; 95% CI: 1.14, 1.98), those who resided in wealthier households (RRR = 4.77; 95% CI: 3.03, 7.50), those who used alcohol (RRR = 1.43; 95% CI: 1.12, 1.82) and/or watched the television (RRR = 1.70; 95% CI: 1.35, 2.13). Conclusion Our study suggests that relevant government jurisdictions need to identify, promote, and implement evidence-based interventions that can simultaneously address underweight and overweight/obesity among reproductive age women in Tanzania."
https://openalex.org/W3080468968,"The mechanisms underlying the two-way relationship between diabetes mellitus (DM) and periodontitis are unclear. We examined a possible effect of galectin-3 (Gal-3), a factor in DM and bone metabolism, on periodontitis with or without DM. Using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, we detected saliva Gal-3 in patients with periodontitis, with or without type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). In animal models, we measured periodontal bone microarchitecture via micro computed tomography, and detected Gal-3, Runt-related transcription factor 2 (Runx2), and interleukin-6 (IL-6) expression in alveolar bone. Applying dual luciferase reporter assay, we explored the target binding of miR-124-3p and Gal-3. We examined osteocyte-derived exosomes with transmission electron microscopy and detected miR-124-3p, Gal-3, and IL-6 expression in exosomes. Saliva Gal-3 was increased in DM compared with controls but decreased in patients with moderate periodontitis and DM compared with those who had moderate periodontitis only. Alveolar bone mass was increased in DM and exacerbated in DM with periodontitis. Gal-3 and Runx2 were both increased in periodontitis and DM compared with controls, but decreased in DM with periodontitis compared with DM alone. MiR-124-3p targeted and inhibited Gal-3 expression in vitro. Osteocytes secreted exosomes carrying miR-124-3p, Gal-3, and IL-6, which were influenced by high glucose. These findings indicate that osteocyte-derived exosomes carrying miR-124-3p may regulate Gal-3 expression of osteoblasts, especially under high-glucose conditions, suggesting a possible mechanism for DM-related alveolar bone pathologies."
https://openalex.org/W3080771521,"Introduction Neonatal infections are a common cause of death in India, but many families cannot access appropriate hospitals for its treatment due to various reasons. We implemented the World Health Organization PSBI management guideline when referral is not feasible within the public health system in Pune, India to evaluate feasibility, barriers and facilitators for its implementation. Methods A national-level consultative meeting between government officials and study partners resulted in a consensus on adaptation and implementation in four demonstration sites in selected states in India. At the state and district levels, similar meetings to plan the implementation strategy and roles were held between KEM Hospital Research Centre (KEMHRC) Pune and the public health system Pune, Maharashtra. The public health system was responsible for implementation of the intervention at eight tribal primary health centres (PHC) in Pune district, India, including delivering the intervention and ensuring supplies of all commodities while KEMHRC was responsible for technical support including training of health workers, assistance in PSBI identification and management, data collection and documentation of the implementation strategy. Results A total of 175 young infants with PSBI were identified and managed. Of these, 34 had critical illness (CI), 46 had clinical severe infection (CSI) and 10 were infants aged 0–6 days with fast breathing (FB) while 85 infants aged 7–59 days had fast breathing. Assuming a 10% incidence of PSBI among all live births, with 3071 live births recorded, the actual incidence of PSBI found in the study was 5.7%, resulting in an actual coverage was of 57%. Among the 90 infants with CI, CSI and FB in 0–6 days, who were advised referral to government tertiary care centre as per the PSBI guideline algorithm, 81 (90%) accepted referral while 9 (10%) refused and were offered treatment at primary health centres (PHC) with a seven-day course of injectable gentamicin and oral amoxicillin. All infants with FB in 7–59 days were offered treatment at PHCs as per the PSBI guideline algorithm with a seven-day course of oral amoxicillin. All except six infants who died and one with FB in 7–59 days, who was lost to follow-up, were successfully cured. Of the six who died, five had CSI and one had CI. Among the 81 infants with CI, CSI and FB in 0–6 days who accepted referral; 48(53%) were successfully referred to government tertiary facility while 33 (36.6%) preferred to visit a private tertiary health facility. The implementation strategy demonstrated a relatively high fidelity, acceptance and intervention penetration. Lack of training and confidence of the public health staff were major challenges faced, which were resolved to a large extent through supportive supervision and re-trainings. Conclusion Management of PSBI is feasible to implement in out-patient facilities in the public health system, but technical support to the health system is required to jump-start the process. Fast breathing in 7–59 days old infants can be managed with oral amoxicillin without referral. A sustainable adoption of this intervention by the health system can lead to decrease in neonatal mortality and morbidity."
https://openalex.org/W3081319612,"Many countries have used the new ANACONDA (Analysis of Causes of National Death for Action) tool to assess the quality of their cause of death data (COD), but no cross-country analysis has been done to verify how different or similar patterns of diagnostic errors and data quality are in countries or how they are related to the local cultural or epidemiological environment or to levels of development. Our objective is to measure whether the usability of COD data and the patterns of unusable codes are related to a country's level of socio-economic development.We have assessed the quality of 20 national COD datasets from the WHO Mortality Database by assessing their completeness of COD reporting and the extent, pattern and severity of garbage codes, i.e. codes that provide little or no information about the true underlying COD. Garbage codes were classified into four groups based on the severity of the error in the code. The Vital Statistics Performance Index for Quality (VSPI(Q)) was used to measure the overall quality of each country's mortality surveillance system.The proportion of 'garbage codes' varied from 7 to 66% across the 20 countries. Countries with a high SDI generally had a lower proportion of high impact (i.e. more severe) garbage codes than countries with low SDI. While the magnitude and pattern of garbage codes differed among countries, the specific codes commonly used did not.There is an inverse relationship between a country's socio-demographic development and the overall quality of its cause of death data, but with important exceptions. In particular, some low SDI countries have vital statistics systems that are as reliable as more developed countries. However, in low-income countries, where most people die at home, the proportion of unusable codes often exceeds 50%, implying that half of all cause-specific mortality data collected is of little or no use in guiding public policy. Moreover, the cause of death pattern identified from the data is likely to seriously under-represent the true extent of the leading causes of death in the population, with very significant consequences for health priority setting. Garbage codes are prevalent at all ages, contrary to expectations. Further research into effective strategies deployed in these countries to improve data quality can inform efforts elsewhere to improve COD reporting systems."
https://openalex.org/W3080409807,"Abstract Pancreatic cancer is one of the most fatal cancers without druggable molecular targets. Hypoxia inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) is a heterodimeric transcriptional factor that promotes malignancy in various cancers including pancreatic cancer. Herein, we found that HIF-1 is accumulated in normoxic or moderate hypoxic areas of pancreatic cancer xenografts in vivo and is active even during normoxia in pancreatic cancer cells in vitro. This prompted us to analyze whether the HIF-1 activator Mint3 contributes to malignant features of pancreatic cancer. Mint3 depletion by shRNAs attenuated HIF-1 activity during normoxia and cell proliferation concomitantly with accumulated p21 and p27 protein in pancreatic cancer cells. Further analyses revealed that Mint3 increased transcription of the oncogenic ubiquitin ligase SKP2 in pancreatic cancer cells via HIF-1. This Mint3-HIF-1-SKP2 axis also promoted partial epithelial-mesenchymal transition, stemness features, and chemoresistance in pancreatic cancer cells. Even in vivo, Mint3 depletion attenuated tumor growth of orthotopically inoculated human pancreatic cancer AsPC-1 cells. Database and tissue microarray analyses showed that Mint3 expression is correlated with SKP2 expression in human pancreatic cancer specimens and high Mint3 expression is correlated with poor prognosis of pancreatic cancer patients. Thus, targeting Mint3 may be useful for attenuating the malignant features of pancreatic cancer."
https://openalex.org/W3080941419,"Chemotherapy directly or indirectly affects organs in a short-term or continuous manner. Endocrine organs are especially sensitive to cancer treatment, leading to concerns among patients regarding their quality of life afterward. Side effects to the ovary include damage to the ovarian reserve, resulting in follicle loss, endocrine hormone deficiency, and infertility. It has been previously demonstrated that continuous treatment with 2 mg/kg cisplatin for 15 days can activate primordial follicles, suggesting that the response in the oocytes of primordial follicles was dependent on cisplatin concentration and administration frequency. However, our results demonstrate that continuous treatment with 2 mg/kg cisplatin for 15 days leads to the same consequence as with the continuous treatment of 5 mg/kg cisplatin: the death of oocytes in primordial follicles without indication of activation. Moreover, animals co-injected with melatonin and cisplatin did not display any significant differences from those treated with cisplatin only contrary to the known results. 6-hydroxymelatonin, a metabolite of melatonin, could not prevent follicle destruction, implying that melatonin does not confer the protection of ovarian follicles, either directly or indirectly. Altogether, our data support that fertoprotectants against cisplatin must target molecules that control cell death pathways in the oocytes of primordial follicles."
https://openalex.org/W3081143087,"Minor grain crops are widely cultivated in northwest China and played important roles in local economic. Soil microbes play a central role in ecological function and biological stability and related to soil quality. In order to uncover the soil microbial composition differences and the factors under 5-year continuous monocropping of three minor crops (Proso millet, Common bean and Common buckwheat) in Guan-Zhong Plain, six soil nutrimental parameters, soil pH, soil moisture content, and four soil enzyme activities were analyzed and soil microbial composition were sequenced. The results showed that after 5-years of continuous monocropping, different cover crops influenced most of soil physicochemical properties, expect soil moisture content (P < 0.05), the available nutrients were significant higher in proso millet soil, and the pH was significantly higher in common buckwheat soil. soil ALP, catalase and urease activities were significantly different between soils (P< 0.01), in which soil catalase activities were significantly lower and soil ALP and urease activities were significantly higher than that of proso millet and common buckwheat. A total of 171439 sequences, 9468 OTUs and 29 phylum for bacteria, 128920 sequences, 544 OTUs and 27 phylum for fungi were obtained. In addition, no significantly difference obtained in diversity and richness between soils (P < 0.05). According to relative abundance, Proteobacteria, Chloroflexi, Gemmatimonadetes and Acidobacteria were the dominant bacterial phylum in all samples, moreover, the relative abundance of Caldiserica was significantly different between soils (P < 0.05). Ascomycota (79.04%-90.21%) was dominant phylum in fungal community and phylum Phragmoplastophyta (P < 0.01) and Glomeromycota (P < 0.05) were significantly different between soils. Redundancy analysis indicated that available nutrients Nitrogen and Potassium are the strongest predictors in both bacterial and fungal community. In conclusion, different cover crops influenced soil nutrient properties, soil pH and soil microbial composition, and continuous monocropping decreased soil fertility condition. Moreover, Common bean and Common buckwheat were more sensitive to monocropping treatment."
https://openalex.org/W3080192728,"Endometriosis is a painful gynecologic disease affecting one in ten reproductive aged women worldwide. Few studies have correlated this symptomatology with biomarker levels among women with and without endometriosis, and no studies correlating pain with biomarker levels have been performed in young patient populations. The purpose of this study was to examine whether CA125 correlates with different types and severity of pain among adolescents and young women with and without endometriosis and assess its performance as an endometriosis biomarker among those presenting with dysmenorrhea in this young population. Reproductive-aged women with laparoscopically-confirmed endometriosis (n = 282) and controls (n = 293) who participated in The Women’s Health Study: From Adolescence to Adulthood (A2A), a cohort of adolescents and young women enrolled from 2012–2018, were included in this cross-sectional analysis. Plasma CA125 values were measured using WERF EPHect compliant blood samples collected at enrollment. Average CA125 were calculated by self-reported pain type (i.e. dysmenorrhea, non-cyclic/general pelvic pain, dyspareunia), severity, and frequency in endometriosis cases and controls. Median age at blood draw was 24 years in controls and 17 years in cases, with 68% and 89% non-Hispanic white, respectively. Most endometriosis cases (95%) were rASRM stage I/II. Average CA125 values were 12.5 U/mL in controls and 12.1 U/mL in cases adjusted for age. CA125 did not differ by pain type, its severity, or frequency in endometriosis cases or controls. Among participants who reported dysmenorrhea, CA125 did not discriminate endometriosis cases from controls using cutoff of 35 U/mL (AUC = 0.51, 95%CI = 0.50–0.53). Among adolescents and young adult women, CA125 did not correlate with pain type. CA125 did not efficiently discriminate endometriosis cases from controls even when accounting for pain symptomatology. Average CA125 values were low in adolescents and young women in both endometriosis cases and controls, suggesting cautious interpretation may be needed when measuring CA125 in this population."
https://openalex.org/W3080376154,"Epidemiological studies commonly identify the clinical characteristics and survival outcomes of patients with breast cancer at five years. Our study aims to describe the sociodemographic, clinicopathological characteristics and determine the long-term event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) of a Peruvian population with triple-negative breast cancer.We reviewed the medical records of new cases treated at a single institution in the period 2000-2014. The survival analysis included patients with stages I-IV. Survival estimates at 10 years were calculated with the Kaplan-Meier method and compared with the Log-rank test. We further used multivariate Cox regression analysis to calculate prognostic factors of recurrence and mortality.Among the 2007 patients included, the median age at diagnosis was 49 years (19-95 years). Most patients presented histologic grade III (68.7%), tumor stage II (34.2%), and III (51.0%) at diagnosis. Local and distant relapse was present in 31.9 and 51.4% of the patients, respectively. The most frequent sites of metastasis were the lungs (14.5%), followed by bone (9.7%), brain (9.6%), and liver (7.9%). The median follow-up was 153 months. At 3, 5, and 10 years, the EFS of the population was 55%, 49%, and 41%, respectively, while the OS was 64%, 56%, and 47%, respectively. Moreover, an N3 lymph node status was the most important prognostic factor for both disease relapse (HR: 2.54, 95% CI: 2.05-3.15) and mortality (HR: 2.51, 95% CI: 2.01-3.14) at ten years. An older age and higher T staging were associated with a worse OS, while patients who received radiotherapy and adjuvant chemotherapy had better survival rates.The sociodemographic features of Peruvian patients with TNBC are similar to those of other populations. However, our population was diagnosed at more advanced clinical stages, and thus, EFS and OS were lower than international reports while prognostic factors were similar to previous studies."
https://openalex.org/W3080503522,"Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are small membrane-limited structures derived from outward budding of the plasma membrane or endosomal system that participate in cellular communication processes through the transport of bioactive molecules to recipient cells. To date, there are no published methodological works showing step-by-step the isolation, characterization and internalization of small EVs secreted by human primary macrophages derived from circulating monocytes (MDM-derived sEVs). Thus, here we aimed to provide an alternative protocol based on differential ultracentrifugation (dUC) to describe small EVs (sEVs) from these cells. Monocyte-derived macrophages were cultured in EV-free medium during 24, 48 or 72 h and, then, EVs were isolated from culture supernatants by (dUC). Macrophages secreted a large amount of sEVs in the first 24 h, with size ranging from 40–150 nm, peaking at 105 nm, as evaluated by nanoparticle tracking analysis and scanning electron microscopy. The markers Alix, CD63 and CD81 were detected by immunoblotting in EV samples, and the co-localization of CD63 and CD81 after sucrose density gradient ultracentrifugation (S-DGUC) indicated the presence of sEVs from late endosomal origin. Confocal fluorescence revealed that the sEVs were internalized by primary macrophages after three hours of co-culture. The methodology here applied aims to contribute for enhancing reproducibility between the limited number of available protocols for the isolation and characterization of MDM-derived sEVs, thus providing basic knowledge in the area of EV methods that can be useful for those investigators working with sEVs released by human primary macrophages derived from circulating monocytes."
https://openalex.org/W3080770124,"As a characteristic edible fungus with a high nutritional value and medicinal effect, the Bachu mushroom has a broad market. To distinguish among Bachu mushrooms with high value and other fungi effectively and accurately, as well as to explore a universal identification method, this study proposed a method to identify Bachu mushrooms by Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FT-IR) combined with machine learning. In this experiment, two kinds of common edible mushrooms, Lentinus edodes and club fungi, were selected and classified with Bachu mushrooms. Due to the different distribution of nutrients in the caps and stalks, the caps and stalks were studied in this experiment. By comparing the average normalized infrared spectra of the caps and stalks of the three types of fungi, we found differences in their infrared spectra, indicating that the latter can be used to classify and identify the three types of fungi. We also used machine learning to process the spectral data. The overall steps of data processing are as follows: use partial least squares (PLS) to extract spectral features, select the appropriate characteristic number, use different classification algorithms for classification, and finally determine the best algorithm according to the classification results. Among them, the basis of selecting the characteristic number was the cumulative variance interpretation rate. To improve the reliability of the experimental results, this study also used the classification results to verify the feasibility. The classification algorithms used in this study were the support vector machine (SVM), backpropagation neural network (BPNN) and k-nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithm. The results showed that the three algorithms achieved good results in the multivariate classification of the caps and stalks data. Moreover, the cumulative variance explanation rate could be used to select the characteristic number. Finally, by comparing the classification results of the three algorithms, the classification effect of KNN was found to be the best. Additionally, the classification results were as follows: according to the caps data classification, the accuracy was 99.06%; according to the stalks data classification, the accuracy was 99.82%. This study showed that infrared spectroscopy combined with a machine learning algorithm has the potential to be applied to identify Bachu mushrooms and the cumulative variance explanation rate can be used to select the characteristic number. This method can also be used to identify other types of edible fungi and has a broad application prospect."
https://openalex.org/W3080342643,"Background Whereas 72% of hepatitis C virus (HCV)-infected people worldwide live in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), only 6% of them have been diagnosed. Innovative technologies for HCV diagnosis provide opportunities for developing testing strategies more adapted to resource-constrained settings. However, studies about their economic feasibility in LMICs are lacking. Methods Adopting a health sector perspective in Cameroon, Cote-d'Ivoire, and Senegal, a decision tree model was developed to compare 12 testing strategies with the following characteristics: a one-step or two-step testing sequence, HCV-RNA or HCV core antigen as confirmative biomarker, laboratory or point-of-care (POC) tests, and venous blood samples or dried blood spots (DBS). Outcomes measures were the number of true positives (TPs), cost per screened individual, incremental cost-effectiveness ratios, and nationwide budget. Corresponding time horizon was immediate, and outcomes were accordingly not discounted. Detailed sensitivity analyses were conducted. Findings In the base-case, a two-step POC-based strategy including anti-HCV antibody (HCV-Ab) and HCV-RNA testing had the lowest cost, €8.18 per screened individual. Assuming a lost-to-follow-up rate after screening > 1.9%, a DBS-based laboratory HCV-RNA after HCV-Ab POC testing was the single un-dominated strategy, requiring an additional cost of €3653.56 per additional TP detected. Both strategies would require 8–25% of the annual public health expenditure of the study countries for diagnosing 30% of HCV-infected individuals. Assuming a seroprevalence > 46.9% or a cost of POC HCV-RNA < €7.32, a one-step strategy based on POC HCV-RNA dominated the two-step POC-based strategy but resulted in many more false-positive cases. Conclusions POC HCV-Ab followed by either POC- or DBS-based HCV-RNA testing would be the most cost-effective strategies in the study countries. Without a substantial increase in funding for health or a dramatic decrease in assay prices, HCV testing would constitute an economic barrier to the implementation of HCV elimination programs in LMICs."
https://openalex.org/W3080345808,"Cataracts are a major cause of blindness worldwide and commonly occur in individuals over 70 years old. Cataracts can also appear earlier in life due to genetic mutations. The lens proteins, αA- and αB-crystallins, are chaperone proteins that have important roles maintaining protein solubility to prevent cataract formation. Mutations in the CRYAA and CRYAB crystallin genes are associated with autosomal dominant early onset human cataracts. Although studies about the proteomic and genomic changes that occur in cataracts have been reported, metabolomics studies are very limited. Here, we directly investigated cataract metabolism using gas-chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) to analyze the metabolites in adult Cryaa-R49C and Cryab-R120G knock-in mouse lenses. The most abundant metabolites were myo-inositol, L-(+)-lactic acid, cholesterol, phosphate, glycerol phosphate, palmitic and 9-octadecenoic acids, α-D-mannopyranose, and β-D-glucopyranose. Cryaa-R49C knock-in mouse lenses had a significant decrease in the number of sugars and minor sterols, which occurred in concert with an increase in lactic acid. Cholesterol composition was unchanged. In contrast, Cryab-R120G knock-in lenses exhibited increased total amino acid content including valine, alanine, serine, leucine, isoleucine, glycine, and aspartic acid. Minor sterols, including cholest-7-en-3-ol and glycerol phosphate were decreased. These studies indicate that lenses from Cryaa-R49C and Cryab-R120G knock-in mice, which are models for human cataracts, have unique amino acid and metabolite profiles."
https://openalex.org/W3080880295,"The feasibility of the production of germinated rice extracts using indigenous rice from Southern Thailand, including Khemtong (KHT) and Khai Mod Rin (KMR) from a single location at the Pak Phanang River Basin in Nakhon Si Thammarat, was investigated. The nutritional composition and bioactivity of the germinated rice extracts from both cultivars were evaluated. Optimum germination time for both rices was 96 h, leading to the highest GABA, thiamine, free amino acid, total sugar, and α-amylase activity (p<0.05). Germinated KHT had a higher α-amylase activity than germinated KMR at all germination times. Mashing at 60°C/pH 5.5 rendered the extract with the highest GABA content (p<0.05) and desirable contents of other nutrients. In comparison with germinated Sungyod (local colored rice) and Jasmine (commercial Thai rice) extracts, KHT and KMR showed a higher scavenging activity against DPPH•, OH•, and H2O2 (p<0.05) with a comparable ABTS•+ inhibition. For metal chelation, reducing power and ACE inhibitory activity, the germinated Sungyod extract was greater than KHT/KMR. The results demonstrated the potential use of germinated local Thai rice for the production of functional beverages."
https://openalex.org/W3081445454,"Background In CT-guided transthoracic lung biopsy (CTLB), pneumothorax can occur as a late complication (delayed pneumothorax). The incidence, risk factors, and clinical significance of delayed pneumothorax are not well known. Objectives To compare the risk factors for immediate and delayed pneumothorax after CTLB and to know their clinical significance. Methods Images and medical records of 536 consecutive patients who underwent CTLB were reviewed. All biopsies were performed as inpatient procedures. Follow-up chest radiographs were obtained at least twice at 4 h after procedure and before discharge. Risk factors for immediate and delayed pneumothorax were assessed based on patient-, lesion-, and procedure-related variables. Rates of chest tube insertion were also compared. Results Pneumothorax developed in 161 patients (30.0%) including 135 (25.2%) immediate and 26 (4.9%) delayed cases. Lesion size was an independent risk factor for both immediate and delayed pneumothorax (OR = 0.813; CI = 0.717–0.922 and OR = 0.610; CI = 0.441–0.844, respectively). While emphysema, lower lobe location, and long intrapulmonary biopsy track were risk factors (OR = 1.981; CI = 1.172–3.344, OR = 3.505; CI = 2.718–5.650, and OR = 1.330; CI = 1.132–1.563, respectively) for immediate pneumothorax, upper lobe location and increased number of pleural punctures were independent risk factors (OR = 5.756; CI = 1.634–20.274 and OR = 3.738; CI = 1.860–7.511, respectively) for delayed pneumothorax. The rate of chest tube insertion was significantly (p < 0.001) higher in delayed pneumothorax. Conclusion Pneumothorax tends to occur immediately after CTLB in patients with emphysema, lower lobe lesion, and long intrapulmonary biopsy track. Further attention and warnings are needed for those with multiple punctures of small lesions involving upper lobes due to the possibility of delayed development of pneumothorax and higher requirement for chest tube drainage."
https://openalex.org/W3080106697,"This article presents the design process of innovative prototypes for cervical cancer prevention in primary care centers located in low-income settings in Cali, Colombia, using the Human-Centered Design (HCD). The project was developed in collaboration with a public healthcare network comprised of 38 urban and rural centers with women between the ages of 25 and 65 years, healthcare providers of the cancer program, healthcare administrators and the general manager of said network. Our HCD process involved five stages: research, need synthesis, ideation and co-design process, prototyping and in-context usability testing. In practice, some of the stages are overlapped and iterated throughout the design process. We conducted observations, open-ended interviews and conversations, multi-stakeholder workshops, focus groups, systematic text condensation analyses and tests in real contexts. As a result, we designed four prototypes: (1) ‘Encanto’: An educational manicure service, (2) ‘No le des la espalda a la citología’: A media-based strategy, (3) An educational wireless queuing device in the waiting room, and (4) Citobot: A cervical cancer early detection device, system, and method. The tests carried out with each prototype showed their value, limitations and possibilities in terms of subsequent development and validation through public health research or clinical research. We recognize that a longer-term evaluation is required in order to determine whether the prototypes will be used regularly, integrated into cervical cancer screening services and effectively improve access to cytology as a screening test. We conclude that HCD is a useful for design-based prevention in the field of cervical cancer. The integration of this approach with public health research would allow the generation of evidence during to the formulation of policies and programs as well as optimize existing interventions and, ultimately, facilitate the scalability and financing of what actually works."
https://openalex.org/W3081436504,"The purpose of this study was to evaluate potential insights into the pathogenesis of acute posterior multifocal placoid pigment epitheliopathy (APMPPE) using multimodal diagnostic imaging and laboratory evaluation in long-term follow-up. A retrospective, single-center case series was conducted on seven consecutive patients (14 eyes) who were given a diagnosis of APMPPE from March 1, 2011, through June 30, 2019 with at least three months of follow-up. Clinical characteristics (age, symptoms, visual acuity [VA]), laboratory testing including coxsackievirus titers, and multimodal imaging from fundus photography, spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT), fundus autofluorescence (FAF), fluorescein angiography (FA), and indocyanine green angiography (ICG) were analyzed for each patient. The initial median VA was 20/71 and final median VA was 20/22. Coxsackievirus B (CVB) titers were elevated (≥ 1:80) in six of seven patients, with a four-fold increase in convalescent titers seen in two patients suggestive of recent infection. All patients were treated with oral corticosteroids, and five patients underwent corticosteroid-sparing immunomodulatory therapy. Initially, multifocal deep choroidal lesions were observed in the posterior pole corresponding to patches of hypocyanescence on ICG. Overlying retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) disease was observed on FAF, although this finding was not universally observed, suggesting that RPE disease may occur as a sequelae to unchecked choroidal inflammation. SD-OCT architectural changes confirmed outer retina and ellipsoid zone disruption. FA of active lesions showed early hypofluorescence and late hyperfluorescence with surrounding leakage while inactive disease showed areas of staining. Long-term follow-up of multimodal diagnostic imaging in APMPPE revealed that choroidal inflammation likely precedes RPE change and photoreceptor damage. Elevation of coxsackievirus titers with seroconversion may be associated with an infectious trigger in concert with immune-mediated disease in this posterior uveitis syndrome."
https://openalex.org/W2943120392,"Despite their burden and high prevalence, mental health disorders of children and adolescents remain neglected in many parts of the world. In developing countries, where half of the population is younger than 18 years old, one of every five children and adolescents is estimated to suffer from a mental health disorder. It is then essential to detect these conditions through screening in a timely and accurate manner. But such screening is fraught with considerable ethical, social, and cultural challenges. This study systematically identifies, for the first time, these challenges, along with potential solutions to address them. We report on the results of an international multi- and inter-disciplinary three-round Delphi survey completed by 135 mental health experts from 37 countries. We asked these experts to identify and rank the main ethical, social, and cultural challenges of screening for child and adolescent mental health problems in developing nations, and to propose solutions for each challenge. Thirty-nine significant challenges emerged around eight themes, along with 32 potential solutions organized into seven themes. There was a high degree of consensus among the experts, but a few interesting disagreements arose between members of the panel from high-income countries and those from low- and middle-income nations. The panelists overwhelmingly supported mental health screening for children and adolescents. They recommended ensuring local acceptance and support for screening prior to program initiation, along with careful and comprehensive protection of human rights; integrating screening procedures into primary care; designing and implementing culturally appropriate screening tools, programs, and follow-up; securing long-term funding; expanding capacity building; and task-shifting screening to local non-specialists. These recommendations can serve as a guide for policy and decision-making, resource allocation, and international cooperation. They also offer a novel approach to reduce the burden of these disorders by encouraging their timely and context-sensitive prevention and management."
https://openalex.org/W3081449545,"Objective To evaluate factors associated with willingness to participate in future HIV vaccine trials among men who have sex with men and female sex workers living in Nairobi, Kenya. Background Working with ‘key populations’, those at elevated risk of HIV acquisition, is important to conduct efficient HIV prevention trials. In Nairobi Kenya, HIV infection is higher in men who have sex with men (MSM) and female sex workers (FSW) than in the general adult population, hence the need to establish if they would be willing to participate in future HIV vaccine trials. Methods We administered a structured questionnaire to MSM and FSW enrolled in a simulated vaccine efficacy trial (SiVET). The SiVET was an observational study designed to mimic the rigors of a clinical trial to assess HIV risk characteristics at baseline. After 12–15 months of follow-up, a structured questionnaire was administered to evaluate hypothetical willingness to participate in future HIV vaccine trials. Results Of 250 persons (80% MSM by design) enrolled in SiVET, 214 attended the final study visit and 174 (81%) of them expressed hypothetical willingness to participate in future HIV vaccine trials. These were 82% of MSM and 80% of FSW of those who attended the final study visit. Having a very good experience in the SiVET trial predicted willingness to participate in future HIV vaccine trials. Motivating factors for participation included a desire to receive education about HIV (59%) and to receive healthcare (57%). Conclusions Our data demonstrate high willingness among key populations in Kenya, to participate in future HIV vaccine trials after completing participation in a SiVET. The findings suggest that these groups might be a reliable target population for consideration in future HIV vaccine trials. Assessment of willingness to participate in these populations provides important information that may help to inform future education and recruitment efforts for vaccine trials. Improving the research experience for members of key populations could impact their willingness to participate in HIV vaccine trials."
https://openalex.org/W3080324795,"Cas10 is the signature gene for type III CRISPR-Cas surveillance complexes. Unlike type I and type II systems, type III systems do not require a protospacer adjacent motif and target nascent RNA associated with transcriptionally active DNA. Further, target RNA recognition activates the cyclase domain of Cas10, resulting in the synthesis of cyclic oligoadenylate second messengers. These second messengers are recognized by ancillary Cas proteins harboring CRISPR-associated Rossmann fold (CARF) domains and regulate the activities of these proteins in response to invading nucleic acid. Csx3 is a distant member of the CARF domain superfamily previously characterized as a Mn2+-dependent deadenylation exoribonuclease. However, its specific role in CRISPR-Cas defense remains to be determined. Here we show that Csx3 is strongly associated with type III systems and that Csx3 binds cyclic tetra-adenylate (cA4) second messenger with high affinity. Further, Csx3 harbors cyclic oligonucleotide phosphodiesterase activity that quickly degrades this cA4 signal. In addition, structural analysis identifies core elements that define the CARF domain fold, and the mechanistic basis for ring nuclease activity is discussed. Overall, the work suggests that Csx3 functions within CRISPR-Cas as a counterbalance to Cas10 to regulate the duration and amplitude of the cA4 signal, providing an off ramp from the programmed cell death pathway in cells that successfully cure viral infection."
https://openalex.org/W3081503958,"Background Palliative care is an essential part of medical practice but it remains limited, inaccessible, or even absent in low and middle income countries. Objectives To evaluate the general knowledge, attitudes, and practices of Mozambican physicians on palliative care. Methods A cross–sectional observational study was conducted between August 2018 and January 2019 in the 3 main hospitals of Mozambique, in addition to the only hospital with a standalone palliative care service. Data was collected from a self-administered survey directed to physicians in services with oncology patients. Results Two hundred and seven out of 306 physicians surveyed answered the questionnaire. The median physician age was 38 years. Fifty-five percent were males, and 49.8% residents. The most common medical specialty was surgery with 26.1%. Eighty percent of physicians answered that palliative care should be provided to patients when no curative treatments are available; 87% believed that early integration of palliative care can improve patients’ quality of life; 73% regularly inform patients of a cancer diagnosis; 60% prefer to inform the diagnosis and prognosis to the family/caregivers. Fifty percent knew what a “do-not-resuscitate” order is, and 51% knew what palliative sedation is. Only 25% of the participants answered correctly all questions on palliative care general knowledge, and only 24% of the participants knew all answers about euthanasia. Conclusions Mozambican physicians in the main hospitals of Mozambique have cursory knowledge about palliative care. Paternalism and the family-centered model are the most prevalent. More interventions and training of professionals are needed to improve palliative care knowledge and practice in the country."
https://openalex.org/W3080804333,"VPS34 is a key regulator of endomembrane dynamics and cargo trafficking, and is essential in cultured cell lines and in mice. To better characterize the role of VPS34 in cell growth, we performed unbiased cell line profiling studies with the selective VPS34 inhibitor PIK-III and identified RKO as a VPS34-dependent cellular model. Pooled CRISPR screen in the presence of PIK-III revealed endolysosomal genes as genetic suppressors. Dissecting VPS34-dependent alterations with transcriptional profiling, we found the induction of hypoxia response and cholesterol biosynthesis as key signatures. Mechanistically, acute VPS34 inhibition enhanced lysosomal degradation of transferrin and low-density lipoprotein receptors leading to impaired iron and cholesterol uptake. Excess soluble iron, but not cholesterol, was sufficient to partially rescue the effects of VPS34 inhibition on mitochondrial respiration and cell growth, indicating that iron limitation is the primary driver of VPS34-dependency in RKO cells. Loss of RAB7A, an endolysosomal marker and top suppressor in our genetic screen, blocked transferrin receptor degradation, restored iron homeostasis and reversed the growth defect as well as metabolic alterations due to VPS34 inhibition. Altogether, our findings suggest that impaired iron mobilization via the VPS34-RAB7A axis drive VPS34-dependence in certain cancer cells."
https://openalex.org/W3080466842,"The modern Gobioidei (Teleostei) comprise eight families, but the extinct †Pirskeniidae from the lower Oligocene of the Czech Republic indicate that further families may have existed in the past. However, the validity of the †Pirskeniidae has been questioned and its single genus †Pirskenius has been assigned to the extant family Eleotridae in previous works. The objective of this study is to clarify the status of the †Pirskeniidae. Whether or not the †Pirskeniidae should be synonymised with the Eleotridae is also interesting from a biogeographical point of view as Eleotridae is not present in Europe or the Mediterranean Sea today. We present new specimens and re-examine the material on which the two known species of †Pirskenius are based (†P. diatomaceus Obrhelová, 1961; †P. radoni Přikryl, 2014). To provide a context for phylogenetically informative characters related to the palatine and the branchiostegal rays, three early-branching gobioids (Rhyacichthys, Protogobius, Perccottus), an eleotrid (Eleotris) and a gobiid (Gobius) were subjected to micro-CT analysis. The new data justify revalidation of the family †Pirskeniidae, and a revised diagnosis is presented for both †Pirskenius and †Pirskeniidae. Moreover, we provide for the first time an attempt to relate a fossil gobioid to extant taxa based on phylogenetic analysis. The results indicate a sister-group relationship of †Pirskeniidae to the Thalasseleotrididae + Gobiidae + Oxudercidae clade. Considering the fossil record, the arrival of gobioids in freshwater habitats in the early Oligocene apparently had generated new lineages that finally were not successful and became extinct shortly after they had diverged. There is currently no evidence that the Eleotridae was present in the European ichthyofauna in the past."
https://openalex.org/W3080542234,"Overwintering conditions have long been known to affect fish survival and year-class strength as well as determine the poleward range limit of many temperate fishes. Despite this known importance, mechanisms controlling overwintering mortality are poorly understood and the tolerance of marine fishes to the combined effects of winter temperature, salinity, and size is rarely quantified. In recent years, higher abundances of the temperate Serranid, black sea bass Centropristis striata, have been observed at latitudes further north than their traditional range suggesting that warming water temperatures, particularly during winter, may be facilitating the establishment of a population at more northern latitudes. To examine overwintering survival of C. striata, the combined effects of temperature, salinity and body mass were quantified in laboratory experiments. We identified 6°C as the lower incipient lethal temperature for C. striata, below which fish cease feeding, lose weight rapidly and die within 32 days. A short cold exposure experiment indicated that temperatures below 5°C resulted in mortality events that continued even as the temperature increased slowly to 10°C, indicating that even short cold snaps can impact survival and recruitment in this species. Importantly, fish in lower salinity lived significantly longer than fish at higher salinity at both 3°C and 5°C, suggesting that osmoregulatory stress plays a role in overwintering mortality in this species. Size was not a critical factor in determining overwintering survival of young-of-the-year (YOY) C. striata. Overwintering survival of YOY C. striata can be effectively predicted as a function of temperature and salinity and their interaction with an accelerated failure model to project future range limits. Identifying temperature thresholds may be a tractable way to incorporate environmental factors into population models and stock assessment models in fishes."
https://openalex.org/W3081011784,"Metabolic disturbances and systemic pro-inflammatory changes have been reported in children with obesity. However, it is unclear the time-sequence of metabolic or inflammatory modifications during children obesity evolution. Our study aimed to quantify simultaneously metabolomic and inflammatory biomarkers in serum from children with different levels of adiposity. For this purpose, a cross-sectional study was used to perform targeted metabolomics and inflammatory cytokines measurements. Serum samples from children between six to ten years old were analyzed using either body mass index (BMI) or waist-to-height ratio (WHtR) classifications. One hundred and sixty-eight school-aged children were included. BMI classification in children with overweight or obesity showed altered concentrations of glucose and amino acids (glycine and tyrosine). Children classified by WHtR exhibited imbalances in amino acids (glycine, valine, and tyrosine) and lipids (triacyl glycerides and low-density lipoprotein) compared to control group. No differences in systemic inflammation biomarkers or in the prevalence of other results were found in these children. Abnormal arterial blood pressure was found in 32% of children with increased adiposity. In conclusion, obesity in school-aged children is characterized by significant metabolic modifications that are not accompanied by major disturbances in circulating concentrations of inflammatory biomarkers."

The purpose of this study was to identify the role of NLRC4 inflammasomes in this process and their underlying mechanisms. We performed high-throughput RNA sequencing of fetal membrane tissue from 3 normal pregnant women and 3 term-premature rupture of fetal membrane (TPROM) patients who met the inclusion criteria, and found that NLRC4 was significantly up-regulated in TPROM patients. An observational study of TPROM patients (PROM group, n = 30) and normal pregnant women (control group, n = 30) was performed at the Xuzhou Maternal and Child Health Hospital affiliated to Xuzhou Medical University from May 2018 to May 2019. The expression of genes involved in inflammasome complex including NLRC1, NLRC3, AIM2, NLRC4, ASC, caspase-1, IL-6, IL-18 and IL-1βwas determined via real-time PCR, immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence. Measurement of NLRC4 level in serum was conducted by ELISA assay. The results showed that the NLRC4, ASC, caspase-1, IL-1β and IL-18 levels in fetal membrane, placental tissues and maternal serum were markedly higher in the PROM group than that in the control group. In conclusion, NLRC4 is a markedly up-regulated gene in TPROM fetal membrane tissue, suggesting that NLRC4 is involved in the occurrence and development of TPROM; NLRC4 levels in maternal blood serum are closely related to TPROM and have the potential to assist doctors in predicting and diagnosing PROM."
https://openalex.org/W3080421195,"Background Cognitive ability refers to the ability to receive, process, store, and extract information. It is the most important psychological condition for people to successfully complete activities. Previous studies have shown that the design of the human-computer interface of the command and control system cannot exceed the cognitive ability of the operator of the command and control system, and it must match the cognitive ability of the operator in order to reduce the mental load intensity, and improve the accuracy, timeliness and work efficiency. However, previous researchers in the field of cognitive science have not put forward a core index system that can represent the cognitive ability of ship command and control system operators and the importance of each index, and there are few achievements that can be used for reference. Objective To explore the core index system of cognitive ability that affecting the cognitive process of command and control system operators, and to verify the index system. Methods Based on the classic O*NET questionnaire, two indexes of O*NET were revised, three indexes of response ability were added, and then a questionnaire on the importance evaluation of cognitive abilities index was formed. The questionnaire includes 24 indexes in six aspects: verbal abilities, idea generation and reasoning abilities, quantitative abilities, visual perception abilities, mnemonic and attentive abilities, and response abilities. The cognitive ability importance evaluation data of 202 people from different positions in the ship command and control system were collected. These data reflect the overall level of cognitive ability of operators in the whole ship command and control field. Results The data analysis results show that: firstly, the most important cognitive abilities affecting command and control system operators were visual perception abilities, mnemonic and attentive abilities, and response abilities. Secondly, the results of confirmatory factor analysis show that CMIN/DF, GFI, CFI, TLI, RMSEA, RMR and other indicators used in the model test all meet the requirements. The model has a good fitting degree, and the overall index extraction method is feasible. Thirdly, the independence T test results show that for beginners and experienced experts, there is a significant difference in the important evaluation of mnemonic and attentive abilities, while there is no significant difference in the important evaluation of response and visual perception abilities. Fourthly, the results of Bi-group confirmatory factor analysis experiment show that the structural model has good stability and factor invariance. Conclusions Through the research of this paper, the index system which can express the core cognitive ability of the commander of command and control system is successfully constructed, and the index system has been fully verified by mathematics. The 3 abilities and 10 indexes in the index system are closely related to the work tasks of operators, which also reflects the correctness of our construction results to a certain extent. According to the results of data analysis, there are differences between assistant commanders and professional commanders in the evaluation of the importance of some indexes, which reflects the importance of working age and experience to the promotion of position skills. The results of this research are of great significance for the subsequent acquisition of cognitive ability data and assessment of post cognitive ability of command and control system operators."
https://openalex.org/W3080229138,"The slow cardiac delayed rectifier current (IKs) is formed by KCNQ1 and KCNE1 subunits and is one of the major repolarizing currents in the heart. Decrease of IKs currents either due to inherited mutations or pathological remodeling is associated with increased risk for cardiac arrhythmias and sudden death. Ca2+-dependent PKC isoforms (cPKC) are chronically activated in heart disease and diabetes. Recently, we found that sustained stimulation of the calcium-dependent PKCβII isoform leads to decrease in KCNQ1 subunit membrane localization and KCNQ1/KCNE1 channel activity, although the role of KCNE1 in this regulation was not explored. Here, we show that the auxiliary KCNE1 subunit expression is necessary for channel internalization. A mutation in a KCNE1 phosphorylation site (KCNE1(S102A)) abolished channel internalization in both heterologous expression systems and cardiomyocytes. Altogether, our results suggest that KCNE1(S102) phosphorylation by PKCβII leads to KCNQ1/KCNE1 channel internalization in response to sustained PKC stimulus, while leaving KCNQ1 homomeric channels in the membrane. This preferential internalization is expected to have strong impact on cardiac repolarization. Our results suggest that KCNE1(S102) is an important anti-arrhythmic drug target to prevent IKs pathological remodeling leading to cardiac arrhythmias."

The purpose of this study was to determine molecular localization of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and the possibility of EGFR as a biomarker for the management of conjunctival SCC.In this retrospective study, we performed immunohistochemistry to evaluate EGFR expression and localization in tumor cells, EGFR mutation-specific expression (E746-A750del and L858R), and human papillomavirus expression in a series of 29 conjunctival SCCs.All 29 tumors in our cohort were EGFR positive (100%). Twenty-one of 29 tumors (72%) showed focal EGFR staining, and seven (28%) showed diffuse EGFR staining. In addition, we calculated the percentages of the two most important mutations in EGFR (exon 19 746-A750del (8/29, 27.5%), exon 21 (L858R mutant (2/29, 6.8%)) in conjunctival SCCs. We observed that the translocation of EGFR from the membrane into the cytoplasm was related to clinical prognosis, as we detected correlations between EGFR cytoplasmic staining and final orbital exenteration and between decreased EGFR membrane staining and progression-free survival.EGFR is important in the pathology of ocular surface squamous neoplasia including SCC and is a prognostic factor. Increased understanding of EGFR mutations may have important implications for future treatment options."
https://openalex.org/W3081199689,"The eastern red bat (Lasiurus borealis) is widely considered to be in decline, inspiring interest in identifying important habitats for conservation in the eastern United States. Unfortunately, knowledge of important day-roosting habitats is lacking for much of the species’ range. We examined patterns of day-roost selection by male and female eastern red bats at two study sites in southeastern Ohio, U. S. A, to help fill this information gap. We radio-tagged 28 male and 25 female bats during the summers of 2016–2019 and located 53 male and 74 female roosts. Day-roost selection differed between sexes and study areas. In a mostly even-aged forest with significant historical disturbance, we found males and females roosting in trees located at higher elevations, with no clear selection based on tree or stand characteristics. Specifically, males selected trees with larger diameters located at lower, cooler elevations than females, which selected smaller diameter trees found at higher, warmer elevations. However, in a forest with less historical disturbance and more structural diversity, we found sexes differed in how they selected from available habitats. These data show that heterogeneity in environmental conditions can lead to different patterns in selection, even between sites located within a small geographic area. They also show that eastern red bats sexually segregate on the local landscape in the presence of diverse forest conditions but may not do so in the absence of such diversity. We recommend managing forests to maintain structural diversity across an elevational gradient to provide male and female eastern red bats with suitable day-roosting habitat in southeast Ohio."

In this report, we present evidence suggesting that Myo/Nog cells phagocytose tattoo ink in tissue sections of human skin and engulf cell corpses in cultures of anterior human lens tissue and magnetic beads injected into the anterior chamber of mice in vivo. Myo/Nog cells are distinct from macrophages in the skin and eyes indicated by the absence of labeling with an antibody to ionized calcium binding adaptor molecule 1. In addition to their primary roles as regulators of BMP signaling and progenitors of myofibroblasts, Myo/Nog cells behave as nonprofessional phagocytes defined as cells whose primary functions are unrelated to phagocytosis but are capable of engulfment."

Among the isolates affiliated to the Firmicutes, 26 had less than 97% identity of their partial 16S sequence with that of the closest described species, while one presented less than 93% identity, thus revealing a significant potential for new species in this ecosystem. In parallel, and in order to better understand the differences between the microbiota of high-performing and low-performing animals, caecal contents of animals collected from these two farms and from a third farm with long history of low performance were collected and sequenced. This compositional analysis revealed an enrichment of Faecalibacterium-and Campylobacter-related sequences in lower-performing animals whereas there was a higher abundance of enterobacteria-related sequences in high-performing animals. We then investigated antibiosis activity against C. jejuni ATCC 700819 and C. jejuni field isolate as a first phenotypic trait to select probiotic candidates. Antibiosis was found to be limited to a few strains, including several lactic acid bacteria, a strain of Bacillus horneckiae and a strain of Escherichia coli. The antagonist activity depended on test conditions that mimicked the evolution of the intestinal environment of the chicken during its lifetime, i.e. temperature (37°C or 42°C) and oxygen levels (aerobic or anaerobic conditions). This should be taken into account according to the stage of development of the animal at which administration of the active strain is envisaged."

First, aerosol optical depth (AOD) data collected using a ground-based sun photometer were used to calibrate the satellite remote sensing AOD data. Next, we screened for the factors affecting the illuminance of clear sky and detected three important factors, namely the sine of the solar altitude angle, aerosol optical thickness, and atmospheric precise water content. Finally, based on the AOD data of satellite remote sensing, combined with the local illumination data and meteorological data, a clear sky average hourly illumination model in Chongqing was established via the regression method. There was good agreement between the calculated and the measured values of clear day average hourly illuminance, with a root mean square difference and mean bias difference of 22% and -0.05%, respectively. The model was used to map clear day annual, quarterly, and monthly average hourly illuminance. The maps show the clear day annual, seasonal, and monthly variations of average hourly illuminance in Chongqing."
https://openalex.org/W3081260543,"This study aims to analyze the formation of the frame of breast cancer research. To test our hypothesis that the research frame depends on the funding sources, we collected the abstracts of 48,448 breast cancer research papers from PubMed and applied structural topic modeling, word network analysis, and LASSO logistic regression to the data. In particular, we analyzed the relationship between funding sources and the molecularization of breast cancer knowledge. The results show that government-funded research is likely to have molecular objects or population as the unit of interest, whereas the research not funded by the government is likely to have individual patients as the unit of interest in relation to specific treatments. This phenomenon is attributed to the different interests of government institutions and the private sector. This study improves our understanding of molecularization and medical knowledge production."
https://openalex.org/W3081472319,"Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are environmental pollutants and endocrine disruptors, harmfully affecting reproductive, endocrine, neurological and immunological systems. This broad influence has implications for processes such as wound healing, which is modulated by the immunological response of the body. Conversely, while PCBs can be linked to diminished wound healing, outside of PCB pollution systems, exercise has been shown to accelerate wound healing. However, the potential for moderate intensity exercise to modulate or offset the harmful effects of a toxin like PCB are yet unknown. A key aim of the present study was to examine how PCB exposure at different doses (0, 100, 500, 1000 ppm i.p.) altered wound healing in exercised versus non-exercised subgroups of mice. We examined PCB effects on immune function in more depth by analyzing the concentrations of cytokines, interleukin-1β (IL-1β), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), Interleukin-6 (IL-6) and granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) in these wounds inflicted by punch biopsy. Mice were euthanized at Day 3 or Day 5 after PCB injection (n = 3–6) and skin excised from the wound area was homogenized and analyzed for cytokine content. Results revealed that wound healing was not signficantly impacted by either PCB exposure or exercise, but there were patterns of delays in healing that depended on PCB dose. Changes in cytokines were also observed and depended on PCB dose and exercise experience. For example, IL-1β concentrations in Day 5 mice without PCB administration were 33% less in exercised mice than mice not exercised. However, IL-1β concentrations in Day 3 mice administered 100 ppm were 130% greater in exercised mice than not exercisedmice. Changes in the other measured cytokines varied with mainly depressions at lesser PCB doses and elevations at higher doses. Exercise had diverse effects on cytokine levels, but increased cytokine levels in the two greater doses. Explanations for these diverse effects include the use of young animals with more rapid wound healing rates less affected by toxin exposure, as well as PCB-mediated compensatory effects at specific doses which could actually enhance immune function. Future work should examine these interactions in more detail across a developmental time span. Understanding how manipulating the effects of exposure to environemntal contaminants using behavioral modification could be very useful in certain high risk populations or exposed individuals."
https://openalex.org/W3080472415,"Background Acute type A aortic dissection (ATAAD) is a life-threatening disease that requires emergent surgical intervention. This retrospective study aimed to clarify the individual characteristics, short-term and mid-term outcomes, and prognostic factors of patients who underwent surgical repair of ATAAD with preoperative cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). Methods Between January 2007 and January 2020, 656 consecutive patients underwent ATAAD repair at our institution; 22 (3.4%) of these patients underwent CPR prior to surgery. Patients who underwent preoperative CPR were classified as the survivor group (n = 9) and non-survivor group (n = 13), according to whether they survived to hospital discharge. Clinical features, surgical information, and postoperative complications were analyzed and compared. Three-year cumulative survival rates and cerebral performance categories (CPC) scores are presented. Results In patients undergoing CPR prior to ATAAD surgery, the in-hospital mortality rate was 59.1%. A total of 72.7% of patients underwent concomitant surgical resuscitation procedures during CPR such as emergent subxiphoid pericardiotomy and/or emergent cardiopulmonary bypass. The survivor group had a higher rate of return of spontaneous heartbeat (ROSB) compared to the non-survivor group (100% versus 53.8%; P = 0.017). The 3-year cumulative survival rates were 35.1% (95% confidence interval [CI], 27.6%–42.6%) and 85.7% (95% CI, 81.9%–88.8%) for overall patients and for survivors, respectively. As for the neurological outcome, 77.8% (7/9) of patients had full cerebral performance (CPC-1) at the 3-month follow-up examination after discharge. Conclusions Patients with ATAAD undergoing preoperative CPR, especially those without ROSB after CPR, are at high risk for in-hospital mortality. However, the short-term and mid-term outcomes, including the cerebral performance after discharge and 3-year survival rate, are promising for patients who survived to discharge."
https://openalex.org/W3081497337,"Objectives The aim of our study is to examine the association between knowledge about the World War II (WWII)-related traumatic experiences of their ancestors and subjective well-being (SWB) of young adults, i.e., descendants of Polish survivors of WWII. Specifically, we focus on the life satisfaction and the mental, physical, and psychosocial well-being of our participants in relation to their knowledge about WWII trauma in their family histories. Method The sample comprised 500 Polish young adults recruited from a nonclinical general population. Participants first filled out a questionnaire assessing their knowledge about traumatic events that their ancestors could have experienced during WWII (see grandparents/mothers, great-grandparents/mothers). After that, subjects were given inventories to assess their SWB, i.e., the Satisfaction with Life Scale (SWLS) and the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-28). Results Latent profile analysis was applied to extract profiles of participants differing with regard to the scope of knowledge about WWII-related traumatic experiences among ancestors. Specifically, six profiles were observed, and a general lack of knowledge about this kind of trauma in the family was characteristic of the sample. We also found differences in SWB across profiles of participants, with worse SWB in the profiles with the highest lack of knowledge about WWII-related traumatic experiences in the family. Conclusion Our study adds to the literature on intergenerational trauma by applying a person-centred perspective, a methodological approach almost invisible in research on that topic. In addition, our findings can serve as a stimulus for more comprehensive debate on WWII trauma in Polish society."
https://openalex.org/W3080185349,"Herein we describe Ocrepeira klamt sp. n. (Araneae: Araneidae), a new orb-weaving spider species from a Colombian páramo, which was formerly inaccessible for scientific studies due to decades long armed conflicts. Both, phenotypic and molecular data are used to confirm genus affiliation, and the new species is placed into phylogenetic context with other araneid spiders. Morphological characteristics and ecological notes of Ocrepeira klamt sp. n. are reported together with the sequence of the barcoding region of cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) to provide a comprehensive description of the spider, facilitating future identification beyond taxonomic experts. With this study we contribute to the taxonomic knowledge that is required to inventory the hyper diverse yet threatened ecosystem of the Colombian páramos."
https://openalex.org/W3080112393,"Land subsidence monitoring provides information required when developing land use plans and allows for proactive management of subsidence issues. However, it has been challenging to accurately detect land subsidence areas, especially those under waterbodies. This study evaluated the applicability of integrated use of the optical Landsat-8 OLI and microwave Sentinel-1A TOPSAR imagery to delineate subsidence areas and quantify subsidence rates in a typical coal mining area of North China Plain. An Enhanced Modified Normalized Difference Water Index (E-MNDWI) was combined with Short BAseline Subset-Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (SBAS-InSAR) image to monitor underwater and dry ground subsidence. The results demonstrated that the method could delineate underwater and dry ground subsidence and quantify its rates accurately. The proposed method estimated subsidence area corresponded to 34.8% (16.7 km2) of the study area. The size of underwater subsidence areas was substantial and accounted for 43.7% of the subsidence areas. Seasonal underwater subsidence areas were generally distributed in the vicinity of perennial ones. Dry ground subsidence covered 9.4 km2 of the study area and generally occurred in urban and rural residential areas with the maximum subsidence of up to 80.1 mm/year. This study demonstrates the efficiency and capacity of integrating optical and microwave images to monitor the subsidence progresses, which thus can help develop effective rehabilitation policy and strategy to mitigate the impacts of land subsidence."
https://openalex.org/W3080760253,"Bacteria often possess relatively flexible genome structures and adaptive genetic variants that allow survival in unfavorable growth conditions. Bacterial survival tactics in disadvantageous microenvironments include mutations that are beneficial against threats in their niche. Here, we report that the aerobic rice bacterial pathogen Burkholderia glumae BGR1 changes a specific gene for improved survival in static culture conditions. Static culture triggered formation of colony variants with deletions or point mutations in the gene bspP (BGLU_RS28885), which putatively encodes a protein that contains PDC2, PAS-9, SpoIIE, and HATPase domains. The null mutant of bspP survived longer in static culture conditions and produced a higher level of bis-(3′-5′)-cyclic dimeric guanosine monophosphate than the wild type. Expression of the bacterial cellulose synthase regulator (bcsB) gene was upregulated in the mutant, consistent with the observation that the mutant formed pellicles faster than the wild type. Mature pellicle formation was observed in the bspP mutant before pellicle formation in wild-type BGR1. However, the population density of the bspP null mutant decreased substantially when grown in Luria–Bertani medium with vigorous agitation due to failure of oxalate-mediated detoxification of the alkaline environment. The bspP null mutant was less virulent and exhibited less effective colonization of rice plants than the wild type. All phenotypes caused by mutations in bspP were recovered to those of the wild type by genetic complementation. Thus, although wild-type B. glumae BGR1 prolonged viability by spontaneous mutation under static culture conditions, such genetic changes negatively affected colonization in rice plants. These results suggest that adaptive gene sacrifice of B. glumae to survive unfavorable growth conditions is not always desirable as it can adversely affect adaptability in the host."
https://openalex.org/W3081122800,"In a previous study we have shown that patients with long standing non-specific neck-pain display more rigid neck movement behavior than controls in response to unpredictable perturbations. In the present study we investigated head/neck motor control in patients with neck-pain during a course of physiotherapy intervention and the associations with pain, neck disability and kinesiophobia. In this longitudinal observational study, 72 patients with non-specific neck-pain were exposed to unpredictable horizontal rotations by means of an actuated chair in three conditions; with a visual reference, and without vision with and without a cognitive task before first consultation with physiotherapist, after 2 weeks and 2 months of intervention. The neck movements were analyzed in the frequency domain to cover voluntarily and reflex controlled responses. Questionnaires encompassed Neck Disability Index, Tampa Scale of Kinesiophobia, and the Numerical Rating Scale for current pain. The results showed that the response pattern for the amplitudes of movement between head and trunk across frequencies did not change over time, whereas some changes in timing were found for some frequencies. Pain, neck disability, and kinesiophobia improved after intervention, but were not significantly associated with neck movement responses to perturbations across time or condition. Although physiotherapy intervention improved self-reported function, the rigid responses to unpredictable perturbations remained unchanged. This indicates altered function in reflex mediated control mechanisms, i.e., the vestibulocollic and the cervicocollic reflex systems that control the head in space and on the trunk. Future research should further investigate pain related changes in reflex systems and whether alterations in these systems are modifiable."
