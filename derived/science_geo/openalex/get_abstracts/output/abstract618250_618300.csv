https://openalex.org/W2890263737,"Mapping global deforestation patterns Forest loss is being driven by various factors, including commodity production, forestry, agriculture, wildfire, and urbanization. Curtis et al. used high-resolution Google Earth imagery to map and classify global forest loss since 2001. Just over a quarter of global forest loss is due to deforestation through permanent land use change for the production of commodities, including beef, soy, palm oil, and wood fiber. Despite regional differences and efforts by governments, conservationists, and corporations to stem the losses, the overall rate of commodity-driven deforestation has not declined since 2001.

Working in the model plant Arabidopsis , Toyota et al. show that this systemic signal begins with the release of glutamate, which is perceived by glutamate receptor–like ion channels (see the Perspective by Muday and Brown-Harding). The ion channels then set off a cascade of changes in calcium ion concentration that propagate through the phloem vasculature and through intercellular channels called plasmodesmata. This glutamate-based long-distance signaling is rapid: Within minutes, an undamaged leaf can respond to the fate of a distant leaf. Science , this issue p. 1112 ; see also p. 1068"

More recently, metamaterials have been suggested as a new platform for quantum optics. We present the use of a dielectric metasurface to generate entanglement between the spin and orbital angular momentum of photons. We demonstrate the generation of the four Bell states on a single photon by using the geometric phase that arises from the photonic spin-orbit interaction and subsequently show nonlocal correlations between two photons that interacted with the metasurface. Our results show that metamaterials are suitable for the generation and manipulation of entangled photon states, introducing the area of quantum optics metamaterials."

Karásek et al. designed an untethered, flapping-wing robot with impressive agility that can mimic fruitfly maneuvers (see the Perspective by Ruffier). They studied the robot's motion during rapid banked turns, which revealed that passive motion through the turn generated yaw torque coupling. This correcting yaw rotation propelled the robot toward the escape heading needed for effective turning. Science , this issue p. 1089 ; see also p. 1073"
https://openalex.org/W2798207849,"Metasurfaces based on resonant nanophotonic structures have enabled novel types of flat-optics devices often outperforming the capabilities of bulk components, yet these advances remain largely unexplored for quantum applications. We show that non-classical multi-photon interferences can be achieved at the subwavelength scale in all-dielectric metasurfaces. We simultaneously image multiple projections of quantum states with a single metasurface, enabling a robust reconstruction of amplitude, phase, coherence, and entanglement of multi-photon polarization-encoded states. One- and two-photon states are reconstructed through nonlocal photon correlation measurements with polarization-insensitive click-detectors positioned after the metasurface, and the scalability to higher photon numbers is established theoretically. Our work illustrates the feasibility of ultra-thin quantum metadevices for the manipulation and measurement of multi-photon quantum states with applications in free-space quantum imaging and communications."

Immunological T follicular helper (T FH ) cells are a subpopulation of CD4 + T cells that support B cell antibody production and the establishment of B cell memory. By contrast, non-T FH cells orchestrate enhanced innate immune cell functions at sites of pathogen encounter. The factors underlying differentiation into a T FH or non-T FH cell remain poorly understood, though there is evidence to suggest that the T cell growth factor interleukin-2 (IL-2) may play a role. Using IL-2 reporter mice, DiToro et al. show that naïve CD4 + T cells that produce IL-2 are fated to become T FH cells, whereas nonproducers, which receive IL-2, become non-T FH cells. The CD4 + T cell–fate decision was linked to T cell receptor strength—only those naïve CD4 + T cells that received the highest T cell receptor signals were able to produce IL-2.

https://openalex.org/W2892325866,"Background Meta-analyses frequently include studies with small sample sizes. Researchers usually fail to account for sampling error in the reported within-study variances; they model the observed study-specific effect sizes with the within-study variances and treat these sample variances as if they were the true variances. However, this sampling error may be influential when sample sizes are small. This article illustrates that the sampling error may lead to substantial bias in meta-analysis results. Methods We conducted extensive simulation studies to assess the bias caused by sampling error. Meta-analyses with continuous and binary outcomes were simulated with various ranges of sample size and extents of heterogeneity. We evaluated the bias and the confidence interval coverage for five commonly-used effect sizes (i.e., the mean difference, standardized mean difference, odds ratio, risk ratio, and risk difference). Results Sampling error did not cause noticeable bias when the effect size was the mean difference, but the standardized mean difference, odds ratio, risk ratio, and risk difference suffered from this bias to different extents. The bias in the estimated overall odds ratio and risk ratio was noticeable even when each individual study had more than 50 samples under some settings. Also, Hedges’ g, which is a bias-corrected estimate of the standardized mean difference within studies, might lead to larger bias than Cohen’s d in meta-analysis results. Conclusions Cautions are needed to perform meta-analyses with small sample sizes. The reported within-study variances may not be simply treated as the true variances, and their sampling error should be fully considered in such meta-analyses."

Because each component is independently tunable, the reaction is especially well suited to the assembly of diverse compound libraries. However, stereoselectivity has been a challenge. Zhang et al. now show that chiral phosphoric acids can catalyze the four-component coupling with high enantioselectivity (see the Perspective by Riva).

Working in mice, Bolding and Franks simultaneously recorded spiking activity from neurons in the olfactory bulb and piriform cortex, two important brain regions for olfaction. Odor information was transformed from a representation that was highly concentration dependent in the olfactory bulb to a representation that was largely concentration invariant in the piriform cortex. The underlying mechanism involves a “winner-takes-all” lateral inhibition. In the collateral network of the piriform cortex, the principal cells responded promptly to output from the olfactory bulb, and recurrent inhibition curtailed the intensity dependence of the signal.

Almost all cellular proteins are synthesized in the cytosol, and thus, organelle-resident proteins must be directed to their appropriate location after synthesis. Working in yeast, Hansen et al. identified a protein-targeting paradigm termed ER-SURF, in which the membrane expanse of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) serves as a “capture net” for mitochondrial proteins. This process productively redirected mitochondrial precursor proteins for efficient mitochondrial import. Thus, two distinct organelles, once thought to be mutually exclusive protein destinations, can cooperate during protein targeting. Science , this issue p. 1118"

https://openalex.org/W2890638737,"Mammalian sperm must undergo capacitation as a preparation for entering into hyperactivated motility, undergoing the acrosome reaction, and acquiring fertilizing ability. One of the initial capacitation events occurs when sperm encounter an elevated HCO3− concentration. This anion activates the atypical adenylyl cyclase Adcy10, increases intracellular cAMP, and stimulates protein kinase A (PKA). Moreover, an increase in intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) is essential for sperm capacitation. Although a cross-talk between cAMP-dependent pathways and Ca2+ clearly plays an essential role in sperm capacitation, the connection between these signaling events is incompletely understood. Here, using three different approaches, we found that CatSper, the main sperm Ca2+ channel characterized to date, is up-regulated by a cAMP-dependent activation of PKA in mouse sperm. First, HCO3− and the PKA-activating permeable compound 8-Br-cAMP induced an increase in [Ca2+]i, which was blocked by the PKA peptide inhibitor PKI, and H89, another PKA inhibitor, also abrogated the 8-Br-cAMP response. Second, HCO3− increased the membrane depolarization induced upon divalent cation removal by promoting influx of monovalent cations through CatSper channels, which was inhibited by PKI, H89, and the CatSper blocker HC-056456.

In addition to cAMP, sperm capacitation is also associated with the modulation of [Ca2+]i, and multiple data indicate that Ca2+ plays a biphasic role in the regulation of cAMP homeostasis.

On the other hand, it has been shown that increasing the concentration of intracellular Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i) using Ca2+ ionophores such as A23187 resulted in complete loss of motility. However, A23187-treated sperm are not dead; if the ionophore is washed out, they recover motility and undergo hyperactivation (17Tateno H. Krapf D. Hino T. Sánchez-Cárdenas C. Darszon A.

Altogether, these experiments suggest that, in sperm, Ca2+ plays a role downstream of the activation of cAMP-dependent pathways. Despite these findings, how cAMP regulates [Ca2+]i is not clear. During capacitation, [Ca2+]i increases and it has been shown that the sperm-specific Ca2+ channel CatSper contributes to the influx of this cation. This channel complex is modulated by changes in intracellular pH (pHi) and in membrane potential (Em). Mice lacking the CatSper channel complex are sterile and their sperm are unable to undergo the capacitation-associated changes in the sperm motility pattern known as hyperactivation (14Lishko P.V.

CatSper is constituted by a complex that contains nine proteins: four that form a pore through which Ca2+ can enter (CatSper 1–4), and five accessory proteins whose roles in hyperactivated motility are less clear (21Chung J.J.

The localization of CatSper in the mouse sperm flagella is notable; it is found in four parallel tracks which generate unique Ca2+ signaling domains along the principal piece of the flagella. Although the roles of cAMP and CatSper in sperm capacitation are well established, the extent to which CatSper is modulated by a cAMP-dependent pathway is still controversial. On the one hand, it is well established that permeable cAMP agonists can induce an increase in [Ca2+]i in sperm (22Brenker C. Goodwin N. Weyand I. Kashikar N.D. Naruse M. Krähling M. Müller A. Kaupp U.B. Strünker T.

On the other hand, CatSper does not have any predicted cAMP-binding domain, and recent work by Strünker and co-workers presented evidence that the stimulation of human CatSper by these modified cAMP agonists is because of the chemical moieties modifying the cAMP molecule acting externally on CatSper (22Brenker C. Goodwin N. Weyand I. Kashikar N.D. Naruse M. Krähling M. Müller A. Kaupp U.B. Strünker T. The CatSper channel: A polymodal chemosensor in human sperm.EMBO J. 2012; 31 (22354039): 1654-166510.1038/emboj.2012.30Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 23Strünker T. Goodwin N. Brenker C.

To further evaluate this controversy, in the present work we used a combination of experimental strategies. First we showed that HCO3− and 8-Br-cAMP induced an increase in [Ca2+]i in single cells. Both responses were blocked in the presence of the PKA antagonist PKI, as were the responses of 8-Br-cAMP with H89. Second, we used indirect recording of Em changes produced by chelating divalent cations with EGTA to measure CatSper activity (24Ernesto J.I. Munoz M.W. Battistone M.A. Vasen G. Martinez-Lopez P. Orta G. Figueiras-Fierro D. de la Vega-Beltran J.L. Moreno I.A. Guidobaldi H.A. Giojalas L. Darszon A. Cohen D.J. Cuasnicu P.S. CRISP1 as a novel CatSper regulator that modulates sperm motility and orientation during fertilization.J. Cell Biol. 2015; 210 (26416967): 1213-122410.1083/jcb.201412041Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Using this methodology we showed that HCO3− stimulated CatSper and that this increased activity was blocked by the PKA inhibitors PKI and H89. Finally, the Em data were confirmed using whole-cell patch clamp ionic current recordings. Our results are consistent with a role of PKA in CatSper channel complex regulation. Notably, cAMP in the pipette solution, in whole-cell patch clamp recordings, strongly activates CatSper current and this effect is blocked by the PKA inhibitor PKI and H89. CatSper current was also stimulated by an alkalinization induced by NH4Cl, but this response was not sensitive, neither to PKI nor Rp-cAMPS, another specific PKA inhibitor. Consistent with these findings, HCO3− was unable to stimulate ionic currents in sperm from CatSper KO mice. Altogether our results strongly suggest that CatSper channels are activated by PKA by either direct or indirect phosphorylation, highlighting a connection between these two major signaling pathways required for sperm capacitation. Capacitation involves cAMP production and Ca2+ uptake. Because Adcy10 is regulated by HCO3− and permeable cyclic nucleotides have been shown to induce [Ca2+]i increases in mouse sperm, we reexamined the [Ca2+]i responses to these compounds. Addition of control vehicle in sperm loadedwith the Ca2+-sensitive dye Fluo-3 did not elicit any Ca2+ responses (Fig. 1A). In contrast, addition of HCO3− induced a reproducible increase in [Ca2+]i (Fig. 1B). The effect of HCO3− upon sperm [Ca2+]i can be explained by either an HCO3−-induced stimulation of cAMP synthesis by Adcy10 (3Burton K.A. McKnight G.S.

Consistent with the first possibility, the HCO3−-induced increase in [Ca2+]i was blocked by the myristoylated PKA peptide inhibitor PKI (Fig. 1C). Furthermore, in agreement with a role of a cAMP-dependent pathway, addition of 8-Br-cAMP (1 mm) induced an increase in [Ca2+]i (Fig. 1D). Moreover, the effect of 8-Br-cAMP was also blocked by the PKA inhibitory peptide PKI (Fig. 1E). Average fluorescent traces and average maximal responses are summarized in Fig. 1, F and H and G and I, respectively. Although, as described previously (18Ren D. Navarro B. Perez G. Jackson A.C.

Average traces and average maximum responses are summarized in Fig. 2, E and G, respectively. Regarding changes in pHi, it is well established that pHi alkalinization can induce an increase in [Ca2+]i. Consistently, addition of NH4Cl to sperm elicited an elevation in [Ca2+]i (Fig. 2C); however, contrary to the HCO3− effect on [Ca2+]i, the NH4Cl-induced increase was not blocked by PKI (Fig. 2D). These findings are summarized in Fig. 2, F and H.Figure 28-Br-cGMP and NH4Cl induce [Ca2+]i increases insensitive to PKA in mouse sperm.

As shown in Fig. S1, the increase in [Ca2+]i caused by adding 1 mm 8-Br-cAMP (Fig. S1A) was prevented by 10 μm of H89 (Fig. S1B). Average fluorescent traces and average maximal responses are summarized Fig. S1, E and G, respectively. These findings agree with the hypothesis that PKA is involved in the cAMP-induced increases in [Ca2+]i in mouse sperm. The [Ca2+]i increase induced by 10 mm NH4Cl (Fig. S1C) was also inhibited by 10 μm H89 (Fig. S1D). These observations are summarized in Fig. S1, F and H, respectively. Previously we have shown that addition of EGTA to spermatozoa elicited a Na+-dependent depolarizing response (24Ernesto J.I. Munoz M.W. Battistone M.A. Vasen G. Martinez-Lopez P. Orta G.

Considering that in the absence of external divalent cations, CatSper has high permeability for Na+, we hypothesized that the EGTA-induced depolarization was due mainly to this CatSper property and the amplitude of this response can be used to evaluate CatSper activity in a variety of conditions. Consistently, CatSper inhibitors blocked the EGTA-induced response (24Ernesto J.I. Munoz M.W. Battistone M.A. Vasen G. Martinez-Lopez P. Orta G. Figueiras-Fierro D. de la Vega-Beltran J.L.

Although indirect, this assay has the advantage of being straightforward and it is useful to design more demanding electrophysiological experiments. Therefore, to evaluate CatSper activity, Em of noncapacitated sperm was measured with a fluorescent cyanine dye before and after adding 3.5 mm EGTA to suddenly decrease external [Ca2+] below 30 nm in the external media. As a result, the sperm resting Em (−45 mV) was significantly depolarized as Na+ influx occurs mainly through CatSper. As predicted, the depolarizing response to EGTA was Na+-dependent (Fig. S2, A–D). As HCO3− activates Adcy10, to analyze the extent by which the cAMP pathway was involved in CatSper regulation, we first assayed the effect of adding 25 mm HCO3− to sperm on the EGTA-induced depolarization amplitude (Fig. 3A). Previously, we had shown that HCO3− addition induced Em hyperpolarization in sperm (Fig. 3B) (4Demarco I.A. Espinosa F. Edwards J. Sosnik J. de la Vega-Beltrán J.L. Hockensmith J.W. Kopf G.S. Darszon A. Visconti P.E. Involvement of a Na+/HCO3− cotransporter in mouse sperm capacitation.J. Biol.

Once fluorescence reached the new steady state, EGTA was added and the depolarization amplitude measured. The experiments show that the EGTA-induced depolarization was increased when sperm were previously exposed to HCO3− (Fig. 3B). Furthermore, 10 μm of PKI (Fig. 3C) and H89 (Fig. 3D), two PKA inhibitors, essentially eliminated the HCO3− stimulation. Confirming that EGTA-induced depolarization is mainly because of CatSper, 10 μm HC-056456 (HC), a CatSper blocker (29Carlson A.E. Burnett L.A. del Camino D. Quill T.A. Hille B. Chong J.A. Moran M.M. Babcock D.F. Pharmacological targeting of native CatSper channels reveals a required role in maintenance of sperm hyperactivation.PLoS One. 2009; 4 (19718436): e684410.1371/journal.pone.0006844Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), inhibited the HCO3− stimulated response (Fig. 3E). A summary of these experiments is presented in Fig. 3F showing the average differences between Em + compound (EmD) minus Em resting, corrected by the initial HCO3− induced hyperpolarization. The results described above on the effects of HCO3− and cAMP on [Ca2+]i, and of HCO3− on the amplitude of the EGTA-induced depolarization, as well as their inhibition by PKI and H89, suggest that PKA may be involved in the regulation of CatSper. To further evaluate this hypothesis, we conducted whole cell patch clamp electrophysiological measurements by attaching a patch pipette to the sperm plasma membrane cytoplasmic droplet (30Kirichok Y. Navarro B. Clapham D.E. Whole-cell patch-clamp measurements of spermatozoa reveal an alkaline-activated Ca2+ channel.Nature. 2006; 439 (16467839): 737-74010.1038/nature04417Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). As indicated earlier, CatSper monovalent currents can be measured by reducing divalent cations from the recording media to less than 30 nm (30Kirichok Y. Navarro B. Clapham D.E. Whole-cell patch-clamp measurements of spermatozoa reveal an alkaline-activated Ca2+ channel.Nature. 2006; 439 (16467839): 737-74010.1038/nature04417Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). These monovalent currents are because of the permeation of Na+ and Cs+ ions. For these experiments, we used a voltage ramp protocol from −80 to +80 mV (Fig. 4A). In these conditions, we measured typical monovalent CatSper currents obtained in control conditions and after perfusing HCO3− (25 mm) in the same sperm (Fig. 4B). Results from five independent experiments indicate a significant HCO3−-induced increase in ICatSper currents (Fig. 4C). In addition, the HCO3−-induced increase of these currents was suppressed with the CatSper inhibitor HC (Fig. 4, D and E). It is known that the addition of HCO3− may lead to a pHi increase either directly or possibly mediated by the sperm-specific Na+/H+ exchanger stimulated by hyperpolarization or by the rise in cAMP (4Demarco I.A.

A total of 3,683 cases and 3,980 controls were included in this study. Unconditional logistic regressions, adjusted for potential confounding factors, were conducted. The breast cancer risk factors were compared across four birth cohorts by ethnicity.Ever breastfed, longer breastfeeding duration, a higher soymilk and soy product intake, and a higher level of physical activity were associated with lower risk of breast cancer. Chinese had the lowest breastfeeding rate, shortest breastfeeding duration, lowest parity and highest age of first full term pregnancy.Our study shows that breastfeeding, soy intake and physical activity are modifiable risk factors for breast cancer. With the increasing incidence of breast cancer there is an urgent need to educate the women about lifestyle intervention they can take to reduce their breast cancer risk."

All the new-borns admitted in the neonatal Intensive Care Unit of the hospital were reviewed over three years period (Aug2014-May2017). Data were cleaned and exported to SPSS version 20 and both descriptive and analytical analysis were executed. The level of significance was set at P<0.05. Binary logistic regression was used to produce summary of statistics including crude and adjusted odds ratio and 95% confidence intervals.This study reviewed a total of 792 new-borns below the age of 28 days admitted in the NICU of Karamara hospital over a period of three years (August, 2014 to May, 2017). The mean birth weight was 2733 ± 740 g and neonates with normal birth weight stood at 64%. Seven hundred forty seven new-borns (94.3%) were discharged alive while 45 (5.7%) new-borns died in the course of hospitalization making a Neonatal Mortality Rate (NMR) of 5.7% (57 per 1000 live births), and 96 percent of these deaths were early neonatal deaths that occurred in the first one week of life (i.e. <7 days).After all variables which had an association with neonatal mortality (P <0.05) were entered in to a multivariate logistic model to control the effect of confounders: prematurity (AOR = 0.492(0.253, 0.957), P = 0.037) and average length of stay below two days (AOR = 0.418(0.186, 0.936), P = 0.034) were independently associated with neonatal mortality showing protective effect.The causes of neonatal death reported in this study are preventable, the neonatal mortality rate is high compared to the national and regional figures. Prematurity and shorter length of stay in the NICU of less than two days showed independent association with neonatal mortality. This calls for more work along the continuum of care, improving the quality of care, early transfer of sick neonates to the NICU along with scaling up establishment of the NICUs in other hospitals of the region."

The aim of the present study was to evaluate the Metrnl serum level in patients with T2DM and CAD, and also to evaluate the serum levels of Metrnl with serum levels of adiponectin, IL-6 and TNF-α in patients. This study was conducted on 66 patients with CAD, 63 T2DM patients and 41 controls. The serum levels of Metrnl, adiponectin, IL-6 and TNF-α were measured using ELISA techniques. The serum levels of Metrnl were found to be lower in CAD (75.18 ± 28.48 pg/mL) and T2DM patients (73.89 ± 33.60 pg/mL) compared to the control group (95.33 ± 32.56 pg/mL) (p < 0.005 and p<0.003, respectively). Additionally, adiponectin decreased in CAD and T2DM patients as compared to the control group, while IL-6 and TNF-α were higher in CAD and T2DM patients. Metrnl showed independent association with the risk of CAD and T2DM presence. Furthermore, Metrnl illustrated a negative correlation with IL-6 and TNF-α in both CAD patients and also with BMI, insulin resistance, IL-6 and TNF-α in T2DM patients. Metrnl showed an association with CAD and T2DM presence and with components of their pathogenesis such as inflammation and insulin resistance.

https://openalex.org/W2892257246,"Individuals with bulimia nervosa (BN) or binge-eating disorder (BED) experience more frequent and intense food cravings than individuals without binge eating. However, it is currently unclear whether they also show larger food cue-induced increases in craving (i.e., food cue reactivity) than those without binge eating, as suggested by conditioning theories of binge eating. A group of individuals with BN or BED (binge-eating group, n = 27) and a group of individuals with low trait food craving scores and without binge eating (control group, n = 19) reported their current food craving before and after a food cue exposure. Although food craving intensity significantly increased in both groups, this increase was significantly stronger in the binge-eating group than in the control group. This result is in line with conditioning models of binge eating that propose that food cues are conditioned stimuli that elicit a conditioned response (e.g., food craving) and that this association is stronger in individuals with binge eating. As food craving increased in individuals with low trait food craving scores as well-although to a lesser extent-previous null results might be explained by methodological considerations such as not screening control participants for trait food craving."
https://openalex.org/W2892137891,"Skeletal muscle is an important and complex organ with a variety of functions in humans and animals. Skeletal myogenesis is a multistep and complex process, and increasing evidence suggests that microRNAs (miRNAs) and long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) play critical roles in skeletal myogenesis. In this study the expression of miR-351-5p is dynamically regulated during skeletal myogenesis in vitro and in vivo. Cell-counting kit-8, qRT-PCR, and EdU immunofluorescence analysis showed that miR-351-5p overexpression promoted the proliferation and inhibited the differentiation of C2C12 myoblast, whereas inhibition of miR-351-5p had the opposite effect. In addition, miR-351-5p mediated the regulation of muscle fiber type transition in vivo. In vitro, loss of miR-351-5p in muscle tissues promoted muscle hypertrophy and increased slow-twitch fibers in the gastrocnemius muscles of mice. Luciferase reporter assay and functional analyses demonstrated that lactamase β (LACTB) is a direct target of miR-351-5p involved in the regulation of skeletal myogenesis. Expression levels of a myogenesis-associated lncRNA (lnc-mg) correlated negatively with miR-351-5p and positively with LACTB during C2C12 myoblast proliferation and differentiation. Further analyses showed that lnc-mg acted as a molecular sponge for miR-351-5p, demonstrating its involvement in the negative regulation of LACTB by miR-351-5p during skeletal myogenesis.

https://openalex.org/W2891865027,"In skeletal muscle, extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling can either support the complete regeneration of injured muscle or facilitate pathologic fibrosis and muscle degeneration. Muscular dystrophy (MD) is a group of genetic disorders that results in a progressive decline in muscle function and is characterized by the abundant deposition of fibrotic tissue. Unlike acute injury, where ECM remodeling is acute and transient, in MD, remodeling persists until fibrosis obstructs the regenerative efforts of diseased muscles. Thus, understanding how ECM is deposited and organized is critical in the context of muscle repair. Connective tissue growth factor (CTGF or CCN2) is a matricellular protein expressed by multiple cell types in response to tissue injury. Although used as a general marker of fibrosis, the cell type-dependent role of CTGF in dystrophic muscle has not been elucidated. To address this question, a conditional Ctgf myofiber and fibroblast-knockout mouse lines were generated and crossed to a dystrophic background. Only myofiber-selective inhibition of CTGF protected δ-sarcoglycan-null ( Sgcd-/-) mice from the dystrophic phenotype, and it did so by affecting collagen organization in a way that allowed for improvements in dystrophic muscle regeneration and function. To confirm that muscle-specific CTGF functions to mediate collagen organization, we generated mice with transgenic muscle-specific overexpression of CTGF. Again, genetic modulation of CTGF in muscle was not sufficient to drive fibrosis, but altered collagen content and organization after injury. Our results show that the myofibers are critical mediators of the deleterious effects associated with CTGF in MD and acutely injured skeletal muscle.-Petrosino, J. M., Leask, A., Accornero, F.

However, the role of β-arrestins in liver fibrosis remains unknown, β-arr1, but not β-arr2, was upregulated in liver fibrotic tissues in both humans and mice; moreover, autophagy was increased, β-arr1 deficiency or autophagic inhibitor 3-methyladenine (3-MA) significantly blocked autophagy and downregulated liver fibrosis. Furthermore, β-arr1 enhanced hepatocyte compensatory proliferation, and hepatic stellate cell growth with activation via autophagy resulted in liver fibrosis. In the fibrosis, β-arr1 promoted nuclear translocation of Snail by downregulation of glycogen synthase kinase-3β, and the nuclear translocation of Snail was abrogated either by β-arr1 deficiency or by 3-MA. These results suggest that β-arr1 promotes liver fibrosis via autophagy-mediated Snail signaling, and β-arr1 may be a therapeutic target for liver fibrosis.—Tan, S., Lu, Y., Xu, M., Huang, X., Liu, H., Jiang, J., Wu, B. β-Arrestinl enhances liver fibrosis through autophagy-mediated Snail signaling.

https://openalex.org/W2890308206,"In many eukaryotes, translation initiation is regulated by proteins that bind to the mRNA cap–binding protein eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E (eIF4E). These proteins commonly prevent association of eIF4E with eIF4G or form repressive messenger ribonucleoproteins that exclude the translation machinery. Such gene-regulatory mechanisms in plants, and even the presence of eIF4E-interacting proteins other than eIF4G (and the plant-specific isoform eIFiso4G, which binds eIFiso4E), are unknown. Here, we report the discovery of a plant-specific protein, conserved binding of eIF4E 1 (CBE1). We found that CBE1 has an evolutionarily conserved eIF4E-binding motif in its N-terminal domain and binds eIF4E or eIFiso4E in vitro. CBE1 thereby forms cap-binding complexes and is an eIF4E-dependent constituent of these complexes in vivo. Of note, plant mutants lacking CBE1 exhibited dysregulation of cell cycle–related transcripts and accumulated higher levels of mRNAs encoding proteins involved in mitosis than did WT plants. Our findings indicate that CBE1 is a plant protein that can form mRNA cap–binding complexes having the potential for regulating gene expression.

Because mammalian translation factors are known regulators of cell cycle progression, we propose that CBE1 may represent such first translation factor–associated plant-specific cell cycle regulator. In eukaryotes, mRNAs are co-transcriptionally capped with a 5′ to 5′ reverse-linked 7-methylguanosine residue; the presence of the cap structure is an important determinant of downstream processing and regulatory fate (1Topisirovic I. Svitkin Y.V. Sonenberg N. Shatkin A.J. Cap and cap-binding proteins in the control of gene expression.Wiley. Interdiscip. Rev. RNA. 2011; 2 (21957010): 277-29810.1002/wrna.52Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). The cap moiety is recognized by a class of proteins called cap-binding proteins which notably includes eukaryotic initiation factor 4E (eIF4E). 2The abbreviations used are: eIF4Eeukaryotic initiation factor 4EBTF3basic transcription factor 3qRT-PCRquantitative RT-PCRPBSTPBS with Tween 20FDRfalse discovery rate. eIF4E is in turn bound by eIF4G, a large scaffolding protein, to form the eIF4F complex which has important roles in translation initiation. eIF4G contacts eIF4B and the RNA helicase eIF4A which promote unwinding of secondary structure in the mRNA during translation initiation (2Browning K.S.

The importance of the eIF4F complex is such that mRNA cap recognition by eIF4E is considered a central control point in translation initiation and its regulation (4Richter J.D. Sonenberg N. Regulation of cap-dependent translation by eIF4E inhibitory proteins.Nature. 2005; 433 (15690031): 477-48010.1038/nature03205Crossref PubMed Scopus (752) Google Scholar). eukaryotic initiation factor 4E basic transcription factor 3 quantitative RT-PCR PBS with Tween 20 false discovery rate. eIF4G contains a well-conserved motif, (Y(x)4Lϕ), where x is any amino acid and ϕ is a hydrophobic residue, which is required for eIF4E binding (5Gross J.D.

This motif is shared by a number of other eIF4E-binding proteins (4E-BPs) (6Rhoads R.E. eIF4E: new family members, new binding partners, new roles.J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284 (19237539): 16711-1671510.1074/jbc.R900002200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). In mammals, 4E-BPs are regulated by phosphorylation through the mTOR pathway. In the absence of phosphorylation, 4E-BPs compete with eIF4G for binding of eIF4E, sequestering the protein away to reduce levels of translation. Activation of mTOR leads to phosphorylation of 4E-BPs, reducing their affinity for eIF4E and making the protein available for binding by eIF4G, increasing levels of translation initiation (7Mamane Y. Petroulakis E. LeBacquer O. Sonenberg N. mTOR, translation initiation and cancer.Oncogene. 2006; 25 (17041626): 6416-642210.1038/sj.onc.1209888Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar). To date, there is no evidence of a similar 4E-BP-like mechanism in regulation of plant translation (8Browning K.S. Plant translational machinery.in: Howell S.H. Molecular Biology. 2nd Ed. Springer, New York2014: 129-151Google Scholar). Other eIF4E-binding proteins are known to contribute to a range of regulatory processes. 4E-transporter in mammals has an important role in mRNA localization by directing nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of eIF4E and also localizes eIF4E to P-bodies (9Ferraiuolo M.A. Basak S. Dostie J. Murray E.L. Schoenberg D.R. Sonenberg N. A role for the eIF4E-binding protein 4E-T in P-body formation and mRNA decay.J. Cell Biol. 2005; 170 (16157702): 913-92410.1083/jcb.200504039Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Other types of eIF4E-binding proteins target specific mRNAs for translation repression by binding specific sequence motifs internal to the mRNA and binding the eIF4E present at the mRNA’s cap, effectively rendering it closed to translational activation. Examples of such activity are found in mammalian Maskin and Neuroguidin, eIF4E-binding proteins which in turn bind the RNA-binding protein cytoplasmic polyadenylation element-binding protein (10Stebbins-Boaz B. Cao Q.P. de Moor C.H. Mendez R. Richter J.D. Maskin is a CPEB-associated factor that transiently interacts with eIF-4E.Mol.

Similarly, in Drosophila, Cup binds eIF4E and RNA-binding proteins such as Smaug and Bruno which recognize specific 3′ UTR elements in mRNAs targeted for translational repression (12Nelson M.R. Leidal A.M. Smibert C.A. Drosophila Cup is an eIF4E-binding protein that functions in Smaug-mediated translational repression.EMBO J. 2004; 23 (14685270): 150-15910.1038/sj.emboj.7600026Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 13Nakamura A.

Another Drosophila protein, Mextli, is expressed in ovarian germ line stem cells and binds eIF4E to promote translation in a manner apparently independent of eIF4G (14Hernández G. Miron M. Han H. Liu N. Magescas J. Tettweiler G. Frank F. Siddiqui N. Sonenberg N. Lasko P. Mextli is a novel eIF4E-binding protein that promotes translation in Drosophila.Mol.

Flowering plants, in addition to the conserved eIF4E and eIF4G, have the plant-specific isoforms eIFiso4E and eIFiso4G which make up a complex called eIFiso4F (2Browning K.S. Bailey-Serres J. Mechanism of cytoplasmic mRNA translation.Arabidopsis Book. 2015; 13 (26019692): e017610.1199/tab.0176Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The exact mechanisms by which translation initiation is regulated by eIF4F and/or eIFiso4F in plants remain unclear by comparison to mammals and fungi. As no proteins similar to 4E-BP have been identified, and binding affinity between eIF4E/eIF4G and eIFiso4E/eIFiso4G is significantly higher than other eukaryotic systems (15Mayberry L.K. Allen M.L. Nitka K.R. Campbell L. Murphy P.A. Browning K.S. Plant Cap-binding complexes eukaryotic initiation factors eIF4F and eIFISO4F: Molecular specificity of subunit binding.J. Biol.

Plant translational machinery.in: Howell S.H. Molecular Biology. 2nd Ed. Springer, New York2014: 129-151Google Scholar). Arabidopsis thaliana lipoxygenase 2 (LOX2) has been shown to interact with eIFiso4E in vitro (16Freire M.A. Tourneur C. Granier F. Camonis J. El Amrani A. Browning K.S. Robaglia C. Plant lipoxygenase 2 is a translation initiation factor-4E-binding protein.Plant Mol. Biol. 2000; 44 (11117257): 129-14010.1023/A:1006494628892Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) and A. thaliana basic transcription factor 3 (BTF3) shows interaction with eIFiso4E in yeast two-hybrid assays (17Freire M.A. Translation initiation factor (iso) 4E interacts with BTF3, the β subunit of the nascent polypeptide-associated complex.Gene. 2005; 345 (15716105): 271-27710.1016/j.gene.2004.11.030Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). However, the biological significance of the observed interaction of these proteins with eIFiso4E is not known. BTF3 lacks a canonical eIF4E-binding motif and the proposed eIF4E-binding site of LOX2 shows poor evolutionary conservation (Fig. S1) (18Miras M. Truniger V. Silva C. Verdaguer N. Aranda M.A. Querol-Audí J. Structure of eIF4E in complex with an eIF4G peptide supports a universal bipartite binding mode for protein translation.Plant Physiol. 2017; 174 (28522457): 1476-149110.1104/pp.17.00193Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). In this study, we describe the discovery of a conserved, plant-specific protein of previously unknown function, conserved binding of eIF4E 1 (CBE1). CBE1 binds eIF4E in vitro and forms cap-binding complexes in an eIF4E-dependent manner in vivo. Plants lacking CBE1 show dysregulation of genes involved in cell cycle processes. Based on these observations, we propose CBE1 and eIF4E may form regulatory messenger ribonucleoproteins in plants. A previous study by Bush et al. (19Bush M.S. Hutchins A.P. Jones A.M. Naldrett M.J. Jarmolowski A. Lloyd C.W. Doonan J.H. Selective recruitment of proteins to 5′ cap complexes during the growth cycle in Arabidopsis.Plant J. 2009; 59 (19453450): 400-41210.1111/j.1365-313X.2009.03882.xCrossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) employed MS to identify proteins from A. thaliana cell culture that are retained on 7-methylguanosine Sepharose and are presumably associated with cap-binding proteins or complexes. Among the unknown proteins reported, we searched for motifs for interaction with cap-binding proteins. One protein, AT4G01290, appears to have an N-terminal eIF4E-binding motif. To determine whether the protein is an evolutionarily conserved eIF4E-binding protein, homologous plant sequences were gathered and a phylogeny was generated (Fig. 1A). The AT4G01290 protein is encoded in genomes across land plants and appears well conserved; however, it is not found outside of plants or in green algae. Although AT4G01290 is 991 amino acids in length, no identified domains are present in the protein, and it does not have sequence homology to any protein of known function. The N terminus of AT4G01290 features a very well-conserved eIF4E-binding motif (Fig. 1B) and based on its features as a unique plant-specific protein with apparent eIF4E-binding capacity, we named the protein conserved binding of eIF4E 1 (CBE1). The N-terminal domain containing the eIF4E-binding site (amino acids 1–230) was selected to determine whether this protein is an eIF4E-binding protein. The N-terminal portion of the protein containing the eIF4E-binding motif was expressed as a fusion to GST and purified. GST-CBE11–230 was tested for its ability to bind to the eIF4E-family proteins of A. thaliana, eIF4E, eIFiso4E, and 4EHP (also known as nCBP), by GSH Sepharose pulldown. eIF4E and eIFiso4E were found to bind to GST-CBE11–230 but not to the GST protein control, whereas 4EHP did not bind to GST-CBE11–230 (Fig. 2A). To further test whether the CBE1 protein may form an active cap-binding complex, the ability of eIF4E or eIFiso4E to co-purify GST-CBE11–230 was examined by 7-methylguanosine Sepharose pulldown. GST-CBE11–230 was able to co-purify with the 7-methylguanosine cap analogue beads in a manner dependent on the presence of eIF4E or eIFiso4E (Fig. 2B), supporting CBE1 as a protein that may form a cap-binding complex with these proteins. To confirm the direct interaction between CBE1 and cap-binding proteins, the eIF4E-binding site was mutated from (YTRKFLI) to (ATRKFAA) (GST-CBE1mut1–230) to eliminate the residues essential to forming a complex with eIF4E, as has previously been shown for other eIF4E-binding proteins (20Mader S.

(Underlined letters indicate residues that were mutated.) The ability to bind eIF4E was lost in the GST-CBE1mut1–230 mutant protein (Fig. 2C) further validating CBE1 as a bona fide 4E-binding protein. The in vitro promiscuity of the eIF4E-binding motifs of eIF4G and eIFiso4G is known (15Mayberry L.K. Allen M.L. Nitka K.R. Campbell L. Murphy P.A. Browning K.S. Plant Cap-binding complexes eukaryotic initiation factors eIF4F and eIFISO4F: Molecular specificity of subunit binding.J. Biol.

It was our hypothesis that despite the ability of CBE1 to bind either eIF4E or eIFiso4E in vitro, it would more likely to form a complex with only eIF4E in vivo. CBE1 evolved in land plants before eIFiso4E was available, as eIFiso4E is not found in the plant lineage until the appearance of flowering plants (23Patrick R.M. Browning K.S. The eIF4F and eIFiso4F complexes of plants: An evolutionary perspective.Comp. Funct. Genomics. 2012; 2012 (22611336)28781410.1155/2012/287814Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Additionally, the eIF4E-binding motif of CBE1 bears slightly more similarity to that of eIF4G than eIFiso4G. To test whether eIF4E is the preferred binding partner of CBE1, a mixture of GST-CBE11–230 with eIF4E and eIFiso4E was challenged with excess levels of either eIF4E or eIFiso4E and subjected to GSH Sepharose pulldown (Fig. 2D). Excess levels of eIF4E led to lower levels of eIFiso4E co-purification, but excess eIFiso4E did not diminish eIF4E binding. These results support eIF4E as the most likely preferred binding partner of CBE1. Although in vitro evidence supports CBE1 as an eIF4E-binding protein, we sought evidence that they form a complex in vivo. Cap-binding complexes were co-purified by 7-methylguanosine Sepharose beads from seedling lysates of either WT Col0 or cum1 mutant plants, which contain a nonsense mutation in the gene encoding eIF4E protein and lack detectable eIF4E (24Yoshii M. Nishikiori M. Tomita K. Yoshioka N. Kozuka R. Naito S. Ishikawa M. The Arabidopsis cucumovirus multiplication 1 and 2 loci encode translation initiation factors 4E and 4G.J.

The purified proteins were subjected to MS (Fig. 3) in order to identify eIF4E-dependent cap-binding complexes. eIFiso4F and nuclear cap-binding complex components CBP20/CBP80 were identified in cap-binding complex eluates from both Col0 and the eIF4E-lacking cum1 plant lysates. However, eIF4E, eIF4G and CBE1 were found only in the Col0 lysate and were not identified in cap-binding complexes purified from the cum1 mutant plants. Based on these observations, we believe that eIF4E and CBE1 likely form a cap-binding complex in vivo. To further investigate the role of CBE1 in plant gene regulation, we obtained the T-DNA line cbe1 with an insertion in the sixth exon of the gene, which was confirmed to eliminate expression of the full-length CBE1 transcript (Fig. 4, A and B). cbe1 plants are viable and robust but show delayed development relative to WT Col0 plants (Fig. 4C). As CBE1 is encoded by a single gene in A. thaliana and has no clear homologues, it appears nonessential, as observed for single gene knockouts of most cap-binding complex components (24Yoshii M.

As the cbe1 T-DNA insertion occurs downstream of the eIF4E-binding site, it is possible a partial N-terminal product with eIF4E-binding capacity might be present in the mutant; however, the RNA-Seq data (see below) indicate that the transcript formed is not processed correctly and it is unlikely any protein product is made. The effects of the cbe1 mutation on plant development were examined, along with the cum1 mutant lacking eIF4E and a mutant of eif4g, a T-DNA line lacking full-length EIF4G transcript (Fig. S2) (28Gallie D.R. Plant growth and fertility requires functional interactions between specific PABP and eIF4G gene family members.PLoS One. 2018; 13 (29381712)e019147410.1371/journal.pone.0191474Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). A delayed flowering time under long day growth was observed for cbe1, and this delay in flowering is also shared by both the cum1 and eif4g mutants (Fig. 4D). Interestingly, the rate of root growth was unaffected in cbe1, whereas cum1 and eif4g show slower rates of root elongation than WT (Fig. S3). The presence of eIF4E, as well as its large subunit binding partner eIF4G, therefore seems necessary for proper execution of the developmental program in A. thaliana. RNA-Seq of mRNA from Col0 and cbe1 seedlings was performed, revealing up-regulation of 230 nuclear-encoded genes and down-regulation of 122 genes in the mutant line (Table S1). Genes overexpressed in the cbe1 mutant have Gene Ontology (GO) term enrichment in cell cycle processes, particularly those related to mitotic plate division (Fig. 5A), whereas down-regulated genes show no significantly enriched gene ontology processes. The G2/M boundary in the cell cycle is an important checkpoint in assuring genome integrity and preparing the cell for division by forming mitotic spindles (29Vos J.W. Pieuchot L. Evrard J.L.

Five of the six genes showed significant up-regulation in the cbe1 mutant, whereas none were affected in the cum1 or eif4g plants.

The results of the qRT-PCR confirm that disruption of CBE1 activity in A. thaliana leads to overexpression of genes involved in mitotic cytokinesis at the G2/M boundary of the cell cycle, suggesting a role in regulation. Leaf epidermal cells were co-stained with propidium iodide and 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) and imaged with a confocal microscope (Fig. S4); however, there were no significant differences in cell morphology or density noted between cbe1 and Col0. Whereas mechanisms that regulate translation initiation in other eukaryotic systems such as mammals and yeast are well understood, similar mechanisms have largely not been identified in plants. RNA-binding proteins have been described which regulate the translational state of specific transcripts, but global mechanisms for controlling translation remain unclear. In other eukaryotic systems, 4E-BPs control the availability of eIF4E for translation initiation, or by forming complexes with eIF4E that bind to transcripts to repress translation by blocking recognition of the mRNA cap by eIF4F. To date, the presence of similar eIF4E-binding proteins in plants with primary roles in gene regulation has not been substantiated. This report describes a plant-specific protein, CBE1, with an evolutionarily conserved N-terminal motif for binding eIF4E. A. thaliana CBE1 has the capability to bind eIF4E and eIFiso4E to form cap-binding complexes in vitro and forms binding complexes in vivo in an eIF4E-dependent manner. Plants lacking CBE1 protein show dysregulation of cell cycle transcripts, accumulating higher levels of mRNA-encoding proteins involved in mitotic processes relative to WT plants. Although the lipoxygenase LOX2 has previously been demonstrated to have the ability to bind eIFiso4E, its potential eIF4E-binding capacity was only shown in a LacZ activity assay (16Freire M.A. Tourneur C. Granier F. Camonis J. El Amrani A. Browning K.S. Robaglia C. Plant lipoxygenase 2 is a translation initiation factor-4E-binding protein.Plant Mol. Biol. 2000; 44 (11117257): 129-14010.1023/A:1006494628892Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). CBE1 represents the first bona fide plant protein described outside of eIF4G with strong evidence of direct interaction with eIF4E to form a cap-binding complex that may contribute to gene regulation. Outside of the eIF4E-binding motif, CBE1 contains no known functional domains and the processes in which it may be involved are unclear. It has, however, recently been identified as a member of the mRNA-bound proteome (33Reichel M. Liao Y. Rettel M. Ragan C. Evers M. Alleaume A.M. Horos R. Hentze M.W. Preiss T. Millar A.A. In planta determination of the mRNA-binding proteome of Arabidopsis etiolated seedlings.Plant Cell. 2016; 28 (27729395): 2435-245210.1105/tpc.16.00562Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), strengthening the case that it serves a role in gene regulation. CBE1 appears to be required for proper regulation of mitotic cell cycle transcripts, and mutants lacking eIF4E or eIF4G do not appear to have similar effects on these transcripts. Single deletions of eIF4E or eIFiso4E have minor effects in A. thaliana, apparently because of compensation by promiscuous binding of the alternative available protein, whereas double mutants are lethal (23Patrick R.M. Browning K.S. The eIF4F and eIFiso4F complexes of plants: An evolutionary perspective.Comp. Funct.

Behav. 2014; 9 (24492391)e2794010.4161/psb.27940Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). It is unclear, therefore, whether gene regulatory activity of CBE1 is cap-dependent, based on the observations here. It is also not clear whether CBE1 is involved in an upstream process of regulating G2/M specific genes or whether it acts directly on these transcripts in some way. Further investigation of the eIF4E-CBE1 complex will be required to determine the mechanism by which the complex contributes to specific gene regulation. As CBE1 is a large protein, it could potentially act as a scaffold similarly to eIF4G and eIFiso4G to recruit other effector proteins to bound transcripts. However, as it lacks the HEAT domains of eIF4G family proteins that provide interaction with eIF4A and other translation initiation components, it may have more in common with proteins involved in translational repression of targeted transcripts. The downstream effects of loss of CBE1 implicate it as a potential regulator of important transcript(s) involved in the G2/M cell cycle checkpoint. Mammalian translation factors are known to be important regulators of cell cycle progression (35"

https://openalex.org/W2891381987,"Many bone diseases, such as osteoporosis and rheumatoid arthritis, are attributed to an increase in osteoclast number or activity; therefore, control of osteoclasts has significant clinical implications. This study shows how skullcapflavone II (SFII), a flavonoid with anti-inflammatory activity, regulates osteoclast differentiation, survival, and function. SFII inhibited osteoclastogenesis with decreased activation of MAPKs, Src, and cAMP response element–binding protein (CREB), which have been known to be redox sensitive. SFII decreased reactive oxygen species by scavenging them or activating nuclear factor-erythroid 2–related factor 2 (Nrf2), and its effects were partially reversed by hydrogen peroxide cotreatment or Nrf2 deficiency. In addition, SFII attenuated survival, migration, and bone resorption, with a decrease in the expression of integrin β3, Src, and p130 Crk-associated substrate, and the activation of RhoA and Rac1 in differentiated osteoclasts. Furthermore, SFII inhibited osteoclast formation and bone loss in an inflammation- or ovariectomy-induced osteolytic mouse model. These findings suggest that SFII inhibits osteoclastogenesis through redox regulation of MAPKs, Src, and CREB and attenuates the survival and resorption function by modulating the integrin pathway in osteoclasts. SFII has therapeutic potential in the treatment and prevention of bone diseases caused by excessive osteoclast activity.—Lee, J., Son, H. S., Lee, H.

Both products have a similar yellow appearance due to the coloured pigmentation of provitamin A. Using a range of methods to provide a comprehensive understanding of sensory acceptability (blind triangle test, sensory profiling, hedonic preference that included Check-all-that-applies and Just-about-right tests), we tested the acceptability and nutritional perception of traditional West-African food dough-like products (eba and fufu) made from biofortified, fortified, or control products made with non-fortified white cassava (n = 7) at three suburban locations near Ibadan, Nigeria on a total of 122 consumers. Biofortified, fortified, and control products could be differentiated blindly confirming that products clearly differed with respect to other sensory characteristics than appearance. Overall biofortified products were better accepted than control and fortified ones. Three classes of consumer preference were identified based on the dislike for control and fortified products, which indicated that acceptance of biofortified products was not a hindrance. On the contrary the traditional fortified product had poorer acceptance and this was due to its less desirable sensory characteristics as demonstrated by Just-about-right Penalty analysis. A majority of consumers (85%) had previous knowledge of biofortified cassava. Consumers associated ‘yellow colour’ with ‘good for eyesight’, ‘good for children’s health’ and ‘new’. More nutritional benefits were attributed to biofortified than fortified products although they had similar provitamin A contents and this demonstrates a bias. We suggest that nutrition promotion campaigns to improve the vitamin A status should also encompass all natural sources of provitamin A, including biofortified and traditional fortified products."

ILM flap inversion is a recently developed technique that increases the success rate of macular hole (MH) surgery. Thus, we compared the anatomical closure rate and visual outcome in patients undergoing microincision vitrectomy surgery (MIVS) with ILM flap inversion or conventional ILM peeling for the treatment of MH.The medical records of 90 eyes with MH were reviewed retrospectively. The patients were classified into two groups based on MIVS procedure (group 1: ILM flap inversion, 46 eyes; group 2: ILM peeling, 44 eyes).Preoperative characteristics were similar in the two groups, and there were no significant differences in 1 month- or 6 month-postoperative VA between the groups (P = 0.25 and P = 0.42, respectively). However, the surgical success rate was significantly higher in group 1 than group 2 (P = 0.04; 46/46: 100% and 41/44: 93%, respectively). Multiple regression analysis revealed that axial length and MH diameter were independent factors predicting 6-month postoperative BCVA in group 2 (P = 0.001 and P = 0.03, respectively), and that MH diameter was an independent factor predicting 6-month postoperative VA in group 1 (P = 0.03). Logistic regression analysis revealed that axial length (OR = 2.11; P = 0.02; area under the curve: 0.94; cut off score: 28.4 mm) was an independent factor indicating surgical failure in group 2.Our results suggest that MIVS with ILM flap inversion might be best suited to treat MH, particularly in patients with high myopia."
https://openalex.org/W2890090925,"Hepatocellular carcinoma causes ~10% of all cancer-related deaths worldwide, usually emerging in a background of liver fibrosis/cirrhosis (70%-90% of cases). Chemically-induced mouse models for fibrosis-associated hepatocarcinogenesis are widely-applied, resembling the corresponding human disease. Nonetheless, a long time is necessary for the development of preneoplastic/neoplastic lesions. Thus, we proposed an early fibrosis-associated hepatocarcinogenesis model for male and female mice separately, focusing on reducing the experimental time for preneoplastic/neoplastic lesions development and establishing standard models for both sexes. Then, two-week old susceptible C3H/HeJ male and female mice (n = 8 animals/sex/group) received a single dose of diethylnitrosamine (DEN, 10 or 50 mg/Kg). During 2 months, mice received 3 weekly doses of carbon tetrachloride (CCl4, 10% corn oil solution, 0.25 to 1.50 μL/g b.wt.) and they were euthanized at week 17. DEN/CCl4 protocols for males and females displayed clear liver fibrosis, featuring collagen accumulation and hepatic stellate cell activation (α-SMA). In addition, liver from males displayed increased CD68+ macrophage number, COX-2 protein expression and IL-6 levels. The DEN/CCl4 models in both sexes impaired antioxidant defense as well as enhanced hepatocyte proliferation and apoptosis. Moreover, DEN/CCl4-treated male and female developed multiple preneoplastic altered hepatocyte foci and hepatocellular adenomas. As expected, the models showed clear male bias. Therefore, we established standard and suitable fibrosis-associated hepatocarcinogenesis models for male and female mice, shortening the experimental time for the development of hepatocellular preneoplastic/neoplastic lesions in comparison to other classical models."

Here, we present a novel method using aerial photographs taken with Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) to estimate the population size of a burrow-nesting seabird, the Black-vented Shearwater (Puffinus opisthomelas), on Natividad Island, Mexico. Our results provide a census of burrows in the colony, with very low detection error (5.6%). This is greater accuracy compared to other methods based on extrapolating results from sample plots to total colony area. We then combined this burrow census with ground truth data on occupancy to estimate population size. We obtained a population estimate of 37,858 and 46,322 breeding pairs for 2016 and 2017 respectively. The proposed method provides a cost effective and repeatable approach for monitoring numbers of burrows occupied in a colony, thereby enabling easier and faster estimates of population trends. We suggest this method can be valid for other burrow-nesting species in habitats without dense vegetation cover."

A linker region (hereafter referred to as L) connecting two WW domains of WWP2 (also WWP1, Itch, and Nedd4) can keep the HECT domain in an inactive conformation by blocking the flexible hinge loop and the noncovalent Ub binding site (24Chen Z.

Such L-mediated inhibition could be relieved by the phosphorylation of L. Our recent work confirmed the requirement of L in the autoinhibition of Itch and WWP1/2 and suggested an essential role of WW2 (the adjacent WW domain ahead of L) in the regulation and activation of those E3s (25Zhu K.

Interestingly, it has been reported that the Drosophila Ndfip (dNdfip) expression dramatically enhances the wing phenotypes of dNedd4 and Su(dx) by promoting their activity in Notch ubiquitination (40Dalton H.E. Denton D. Foot N.J. Ho K. Mills K. Brou C. Kumar S. Drosophila Ndfip is a novel regulator of Notch signaling.Cell Death Differ. 2011; 18 (20966964): 1150-116010.1038/cdd.2010.130Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), implying that dNedd4 and Su(dx) may also be kept in an inactive steady state. However, whether dNedd4 and Su(dx) adopt a similar autoinhibitory mode as Itch and WWP1/2 and whether the dNdfip-mediated activation of dNedd4/Su(dx) is WW domain–dependent is unclear. In this study, we demonstrate that similar to its mammalian orthologs, Su(dx) is kept in an autoinhibitory state with its catalytic HECT domain sequestered by the WW2L domain. Both WW2 and L are required for the efficient regulation of Su(dx) ligase activity. Human Ndfip1 can release the autoinhibitory state of Su(dx). dNdfip can also activate Su(dx) by binding to its WW domains, although only two of three PY motifs are required. We further find that dNdfip competes with Notch for Su(dx) WW domain binding, implying a dual regulatory role of dNdfip in Su(dx)-mediated Notch degradation. Su(dx) possesses the same domain organization as its mammalian orthologs Itch and WWP1/2, with a C2 domain and four WW domains ahead of the HECT domain (Fig. 1A). As expected, an in vitro Su(dx) autoubiquitination assay showed that the protein adopts an inactive conformation, and the C2 domain plays a minor role in its ligase regulation (Fig. 1, A–C), just as its mammalian orthologs do (24Chen Z. Jiang H. Xu W. Li X. Dempsey D.R. Zhang X. Devreotes P. Wolberger C. Amzel L.M. Gabelli S.B. Cole P.A. A tunable brake for HECT ubiquitin ligases.Mol.

These data suggest that the WW domain region may be responsible for keeping Su(dx) at a low activity level. Primary sequence analysis of these Nedd4 family proteins revealed that most key residues of WW2 and L involved in Itch HECT binding are highly conserved in Su(dx) (Fig. S1), implying that the L (or even WW2L)–mediated autoinhibition mode observed in Itch and WWP1/2 may also be utilized in Su(dx). We then confirmed this possibility in several ways. Combinatorial deletion of both C2 and L (1234HECT) caused a striking increase in Su(dx) autoubiquitination comparable with that of the isolated HECT domain (Fig. 1, A, C, and D), indicating that L indeed played a dominant role in the autoinhibition of Su(dx). However, although essential, L alone seemed to be insufficient for a complete HECT inhibition, as LHECT possessed a dramatically increased ligase activity compared with that of the C2 deletion (12L34HECT) mutant (Fig. 1, A and C). A GST pulldown assay showed that GST-tagged HECT could only pull down MBP-tagged WW12L34 and WW12L and not the isolated L (Fig. 1E). Supporting these data, an analytical gel filtration assay showed that the HECT domain and WW12L34 could form a stable 1:1 stoichiometric complex with a pronounced early elution peak compared with that of the isolated HECT domain or WW12L34 (Fig. 2A). In contrast, the mixture of HECT and L was eluted as two separated peaks (Fig. 2B). Moreover, the ligase activity of Su(dx) HECT could be robustly inhibited by WW12L34, but not L, in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2, C and D). Taken together, these data suggested that L is essential but not sufficient for Su(dx) autoinhibition, and the WW domain(s) are likely involved in its ligase regulation. To determine which WW domain(s) is responsible for the autoinhibition of Su(dx), we created a series of deletion mutants of Su(dx) on the template of the inactive 12L34HECT and tested their ligase activities by an autoubiquitination assay (Fig. 1, A and C). Our results suggested that the deletion of WW34 (12LHECT) had negligible impact on the enzymatic activities of Su(dx), whereas the deletion of WW12 (L34HECT) led to a dramatic increase in Su(dx) autoubiquitination (Fig. 1C), indicating that L and WW12, but not WW34, are responsible for HECT inhibition. This assumption was further confirmed by the observation that L34HECT has enzymatic activity comparable with that of LHECT. Moreover, Su(dx) HECT could form a complex only with WW12L and not LWW34, although the HECT–WW12L complex was less stable than HECT–WW12L34, due to the instability and easy degradation of WW12L (Fig. 2, E and F). Consequently, the autoubiquitination of the isolated HECT domain could be efficiently inhibited by WW12L but not LWW34 (Fig. 2, G and H). We further dissected the role of WW1 and WW2 in Su(dx) autoinhibition. The W1 deletion (2L34HECT) mutant barely had enzymatic activity, whereas the W2 deletion (1L34HECT) mutant had ligase activity comparable with that of LHECT (Fig. 1D), indicating that WW2 but not WW1 contributed to Su(dx) autoinhibition. Although MBP-tagged WW12L could be robustly pulled down by GST-HECT, the isolated WW1, WW2, or L could not (Fig. 1E), implying that WW2 cooperated with L to inter"

In these conditions, hypoxemia has been correlated to reduced appetite and decreased food intake. Since hypoxemia and reduced food intake intersect in various physiological and pathological conditions and both induce loss of muscle mass, we investigated whether hypoxia aggravates fasting-induced skeletal muscle atrophy and evaluated underlying protein turnover signaling.Mice were kept under hypoxic (8% oxygen) or normoxic conditions (21% oxygen), or were pair-fed to the hypoxia group for 12 days. Following an additional 24 hours of fasting, muscle weight and protein turnover signaling were assessed in the gastrocnemius muscle by RT-qPCR and Western blotting.Loss of gastrocnemius muscle mass in response to fasting in the hypoxic group was increased compared to the normoxic group, but not to the pair-fed normoxic control group. Conversely, the fasting-induced increase in poly-ubiquitin conjugation, and expression of the ubiquitin 26S-proteasome E3 ligases, autophagy-lysosomal degradation-related mRNA transcripts and proteins, and markers of the integrated stress response (ISR), were attenuated in the hypoxia group compared to the pair-fed group. Mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) downstream signaling was reduced by fasting under normoxic conditions, but sustained under hypoxic conditions. Activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) / tuberous sclerosis complex 2 (TSC2) signaling by fasting was absent, in line with retained mTORC1 activity under hypoxic conditions. Similarly, hypoxia suppressed AMPK-mediated glucocorticoid receptor (GR) signaling following fasting, which corresponded with blunted proteolytic signaling responses.Hypoxia aggravates fasting-induced muscle wasting, and suppresses AMPK and ISR activation. Altered AMPK-mediated regulation of mTORC1 and GR may underlie aberrant protein turnover signaling and affect muscle atrophy responses in hypoxic skeletal muscle."
https://openalex.org/W2891734612,"Knowledge on whereabouts within the annual cycle of migratory species is prerequisite for many aspects in ecology and biological conservation. Spatial assignments of stable isotopes archived in tissues allows for later inference on sites where the specific tissue had been grown. It has been rarely tested whether spatial assignments match directly tracked non-breeding residences, especially for migratory songbirds. We here compare assignments of stable isotopes from feathers of Palaearctic Barn swallows Hirundo rustica with their African non-breeding residence sites tracked by geolocation.Assignments based on δ2H, δ13C and δ15N isotope compositions delineate three main non-breeding regions: a main cluster in central Africa, a second in West Africa, and the third cluster in Northern Africa. Using δ13C, δ15N only, non-breeding sites ranged from clusters in West/Southwest Africa to South East Africa with a centre in Central Africa. The non-breeding areas (50% and 75% Kernel density estimates, KDE) of the birds tracked by geolocation stretched from West Africa via central Africa to southern Africa. We found little overlap of 0.3% (assuming a 1:1 odds ratio) to 1.4% (3:1 odds ratio) in the three element assignments and KDEs for only 2 and 13 individuals out of 32 birds. Assignment maps for two elements (δ13C, δ15N) and KDEs showed higher consistencies with an overlap of 3.6 and 8.5% for 12 and 18 birds. We argue that the low matching between stable isotope assignments and non-breeding sites in our study arise from insufficient baseline data for Africa (concerning both isoscapes and specific discrimination functions). However, other factors like aerial foraging habit of the species, and a potential mismatch of non-breeding site location and the spatial origin of aerial plankton might further hamper accurate assignments. Finally we call for concerted analyses of tissues i.e. feathers and claws of birds which are grown at known sites across the continent and from species with various ecological requirements (diverse habitats, foraging behaviours, and diet compositions) to establish isoscapes for general applicability."
https://openalex.org/W2890208760,"This study aimed to determine serial changes in self-assessed goal achievement (SAGA) and treatment satisfaction after HoLEP, to identify correlations between the two, and to compare them with results assessed by traditional outcome measures. For a total of 170 patients, outcomes were evaluated serially at postoperative 1-, 3-, 6-, and 12-months using IPSS, OABSS, SAGA questionnaires and uroflowmetry. The SAGA questionnaire consisted of five questions including one open-ended question (self-assessed goals and degree of SAGA) and another question regarding treatment satisfaction. The number of self-assessed treatment goals was two or more in 74.1% of the patients. Most common treatment goal was relief from straining/hesitancy, followed by increased daytime frequency, nocturia and feeling of incomplete emptying. Degree of achievement for the first or second goal and treatment satisfaction tended to increase with time throughout the follow-up period. Patients with the greatest treatment satisfaction scores showed greater improvement by traditional outcome parameters including quality of life (QOL) index, total OABSS, maximum flow rate (Qmax), post-void residual urine volume (PVR) and bladder voiding efficiency (BVE) compared to those without treatment satisfaction. After adjusting for other influential variables, the improvements in subjective outcome parameters including total IPSS, QOL index and total OABSS were significantly associated with treatment satisfaction, but improvements in objective outcome parameters including Qmax, PVR and BVE were not. In addition, the degree of SAGA for the first goal or second goal was more predictive in determining treatment satisfaction than the traditional outcome measures. In conclusion, treatment goals of patients with lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS)/BPH vary from individual to individual. The degree of SAGA and treatment satisfaction for HoLEP tends to increase with time throughout the follow-up period. Compared to the traditional outcome measures, the degree of goal achievement can be more predictive when assessing patient-centered outcomes such as treatment satisfaction."
https://openalex.org/W2891604699,"Antigen presentation on monocyte surface to T-cells by Major Histocompatibility Complex, Class II (MHC-II) molecules is fundamental for pathogen recognition and efficient host response. Accordingly, loss of Major Histocompatibility Complex, Class II, DR (HLA-DR) surface expression indicates impaired monocyte functionality in patients suffering from sepsis-induced immunosuppression. Besides the impact of Class II Major Histocompatibility Complex Transactivator (CIITA) on MHC-II gene expression, X box-like (XL) sequences have been proposed as further regulatory elements. These elements are bound by the DNA-binding protein CCCTC-Binding Factor (CTCF), a superordinate modulator of gene transcription. Here, we hypothesized a differential interaction of CTCF with the MHC-II locus contributing to an altered monocyte response in immunocompromised septic patients.We collected blood from six patients diagnosed with sepsis and six healthy controls. Flow cytometric analysis was used to identify sepsis-induced immune suppression, while inflammatory cytokine levels in blood were determined via ELISA. Isolation of CD14++ CD16-monocytes was followed by (i) RNA extraction for gene expression analysis and (ii) chromatin immunoprecipitation to assess the distribution of CTCF and chromatin modifications in selected MHC-II regions.Compared to healthy controls, CD14++ CD16-monocytes from septic patients with immune suppression displayed an increased binding of CTCF within the MHC-II locus combined with decreased transcription of CIITA gene. In detail, enhanced CTCF enrichment was detected on the intergenic sequence XL9 separating two subregions coding for MHC-II genes. Depending on the relative localisation to XL9, gene expression of both regions was differentially affected in patients with sepsis.Our experiments demonstrate for the first time that differential CTCF binding at XL9 is accompanied by uncoupled MHC-II expression as well as transcriptional and epigenetic alterations of the MHC-II regulator CIITA in septic patients. Overall, our findings indicate a sepsis-induced enhancer blockade mediated by variation of CTCF at the intergenic sequence XL9 in altered monocytes during immunosuppression."
https://openalex.org/W2891413637,"Insulin and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) are closely related hormones involved in the regulation of metabolism and growth. They elicit their functions through activation of tyrosine kinase–type receptors: insulin receptors (IR-A and IR-B) and IGF-1 receptor (IGF-1R). Despite similarity in primary and three-dimensional structures, insulin and IGF-1 bind the noncognate receptor with substantially reduced affinity. We prepared [d-HisB24, GlyB31, TyrB32]-insulin, which binds all three receptors with high affinity (251 or 338% binding affinity to IR-A respectively to IR-B relative to insulin and 12.4% binding affinity to IGF-1R relative to IGF-1). We prepared other modified insulins with the aim of explaining the versatility of [d-HisB24, GlyB31, TyrB32]-insulin. Through structural, activity, and kinetic studies of these insulin analogs, we concluded that the ability of [d-HisB24, GlyB31, TyrB32]-insulin to stimulate all three receptors is provided by structural changes caused by a reversed chirality at the B24 combined with the extension of the C terminus of the B chain by two extra residues. We assume that the structural changes allow the directing of the B chain C terminus to some extra interactions with the receptors. These unusual interactions lead to a decrease of dissociation rate from the IR and conversely enable easier association with IGF-1R. All of the structural changes were made at the hormones' Site 1, which is thought to interact with the Site 1 of the receptors. The results of the study suggest that merely modifications of Site 1 of the hormone are sufficient to change the receptor specificity of insulin.

https://openalex.org/W2949967586,"Previous studies have provided evidence that selective attention tends to prioritize the processing of stimuli that are good predictors of upcoming events over nonpredictive stimuli. Moreover, studies using eye-tracking to measure attention demonstrate that this attentional bias towards predictive stimuli is at least partially under voluntary control and can be flexibly adapted via instruction. Our experiment took a similar approach to these prior studies, manipulating participants' experience of the predictiveness of different stimuli over the course of trial-by-trial training; we then provided explicit verbal instructions regarding stimulus predictiveness that were designed to be either consistent or inconsistent with the previously established learned predictiveness. Critically, we measured the effects of training and instruction on attention to stimuli using a dot probe task, which allowed us to assess rapid shifts of attention (unlike the eye-gaze measures used in previous studies). Results revealed a rapid attentional bias towards stimuli experienced as predictive (versus those experienced as nonpredictive), that was completely unaffected by verbal instructions. This was not due to participants' failure to recall or use instructions appropriately, as revealed by analyses of their learning about stimuli, and their memory for instructions. Overall, these findings suggest that rapid attentional biases such as those measured by the dot probe task are more strongly influenced by our prior experience during training than by our current explicit knowledge acquired via instruction."
https://openalex.org/W2890785464,"Many proteins in organelles of the secretory pathway, as well as secretory proteins, are translocated across and inserted into the endoplasmic reticulum membrane by the Sec61 translocon, a protein-conducting channel. The channel consists of 10 transmembrane (TM) segments of the Sec61α subunit and possesses an opening between TM2b and TM7, termed the lateral gate. Structural and biochemical analyses of complexes of Sec61 and its ortholog SecY have revealed that the lateral gate is the exit for signal sequences and TM segments of translocating polypeptides to the lipid bilayer and also involved in the recognition of such hydrophobic sequences. Moreover, even marginally hydrophobic (mH) segments insufficient for membrane integration can be transiently stalled in surrounding Sec61α regions and cross-linked to them, but how the Sec61 translocon accommodates these mH segments remains unclear. Here, we used Cys-scanned variants of human Sec61α expressed in cultured 293-H cells to examine which channel regions associate with mH segments. A TM segment in a ribosome-associated polypeptide was mainly cross-linked to positions at the lateral gate, whereas an mH segment in a nascent chain was cross-linked to the Sec61α pore-interior positions at TM5 and TM10, as well as the lateral gate. Of note, cross-linking at position 180 in TM5 of Sec61α was reduced by an I179A substitution. We therefore conclude that at least two Sec61α regions, the lateral gate and the pore-interior site around TM5, interact with mH segments and are involved in accommodating them."
https://openalex.org/W2891608612,"A series of experiments were conducted to assess the machinability of high density fiberboard using cemented carbide cutting tools. The objective of this work was to investigate the influence of two cutting parameters, spindle speed and feed per turn, on cutting forces, chip formation and cutting quality. The results are as follows: cutting forces and chip-breaking length decrease with increasing spindle speed and decreasing feed per turn. In contrast, surface roughness increases with decrease of spindle speed and increase in feed per turn. Chips were divided into four categories based on their shape: dust, particle, splinter, and semicontinuous chips. Chip-breaking length had a similar tendency to the variance of cutting forces with respect to average roughness and mean peak-to-valley height: an increase in the variance of cutting forces resulted in increased average roughness and mean peak-to-valley height. Thus, high cutting speed and low feed rate are parameters suitable for high-quality HDF processing and will improve not only machining quality, but production efficiency."
https://openalex.org/W2889616167,"The most challenging stage of cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) is coronary sinus cannulation (CS). The aim of this study was to compare coronary sinus cannulation techniques using electrophysiology catheters and coronary angiography catheters.In this observational, retrospective and non-randomized study, 87 patients who were eligible for CRT device implantation were screened at Kahramanmaras Sutcu Imam University Hospital between March 2014 and March 2018. Seventy-two patients who met the inclusion criteria were enrolled in the study. The study population was divided into 2 groups: the first group consisted of 36 patients whose coronary sinuses were cannulated via electrophysiology (EP) catheters and the second group included 36 patients who received coronary angiography catheters for coronary sinus cannulation.The two groups were similar in terms of the baseline characteristics of the patients. The total fluoroscopy time was less with cannulation using coronary angiography catheters. There were no differences between the two groups in terms of the amount of contrast material and the success of the operations.Coronary sinus catheterization using coronary angiography catheters significantly reduces fluoroscopy time in patients undergoing CRT."
https://openalex.org/W2891065446,"Dall’s porpoise (Phocoenoides dalli) is one of most common North Pacific porpoise species, for which information on sound-emitting processes is limited. To evaluate the mechanism of click emission in the head of this porpoise, the distribution of acoustic impedance in head tissues was calculated using density and Young’s modulus‘which is a measure of linear resistance to linear compression. Two Dall’s porpoise heads were examined: one for macroscopic dissection, and one for investigating the distribution of acoustic impedance calculated from CT-measured density, and Young’s modulus measured by creep meter. Acoustic impedance increased from the dorsal bursae to the melon’s emitting surface, with impedance matching observed at the boundary between the emitting surface and seawater, and was more similar in distribution to Young’s modulus than it was to density. The distribution of acoustic impedance differed from that of harbor porpoise (Phocoena phocoena), despite similarities in the sound-producing organs in the heads of Dall’s and harbor porpoises. A comparison of the physical properties of Dall’s and harbor porpoise head tissues suggests that hypertrophic vestibular sacs and an oval emitting surface are common characteristics in Phocoenidae."
https://openalex.org/W2892134569,"Saline-alkali soil is an arable land resource on which transgenic Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) cotton has been planted on a large scale in accordance with food security strategies. There are, however, concerns about the insecticidal effects of Bt cotton on target insect pests. In this study, a Bt cotton variety, GK19, and its nontransgenic parent variety, Simian-3, were used as experimental models for investigating the effect of the expression of exogenous insecticidal proteins in Bt cotton under NaCl stress on the feeding behavior and nutritional parameters of Helicoverpa armigera. The results showed that the expression of exogenous insecticidal proteins in GK19 was significantly inhibited under NaCl stress. However, the feeding, crawling, resting and spinning down behavior of the 5th instar H. armigera larvae on GK19 Bt cotton, as well as the amount of food consumed and feces produced by these larvae, did not markedly differ under different NaCl concentrations. In contrast, the mean relative growth rate (MRGR), relative growth rate (RGR), approximate digestibility (AD), efficiency of conversion of ingested food (ECI) and efficiency of conversion of digested food (ECD) of the larvae markedly decreased in response to NaCl stress. Under the same concentration of NaCl, the nutritional parameters of the bollworm larvae on GK19 Bt cotton or Simian-3 nontransgenic cotton were different. However, the interaction between salt stress and cotton variety had no significant effect on the feeding behavior or nutritional parameters of H. armigera larvae. These results may provide a scientific basis for determining the effect of exogenous insecticidal protein expression in Bt cotton under NaCl stress on H. armigera and can therefore be useful for the effective application of Bt cotton in saline-alkali soils to prevent and control H. armigera."
https://openalex.org/W2892195954,"About a year ago, I took on the best imaginary job out there: CEO of CryoThaw, the finest company that never existed. I had come across a tweet announcing the 2017 Young Entrepreneurs Scheme competition, sponsored by the University of Nottingham with partners from the U.K. government and industry, in which teams form hypothetical startups based on feasible scientific ideas. As a graduate student unsure of my career plans, I was excited to explore outside academia. I also saw it as a way to develop my leadership skills. So, with the support of my supervisors and funders, I decided to give it a go. I recruited three other students, and we chose to focus on improving organ transplantation. I thought I had everything under control. I couldn't have been more wrong.

> “Team chemistry took off as we spoke our minds, good and bad.” 

They say successful teams are part art, part science. Initially, we were neither. We were just four students with remarkably different personalities struggling to work toward a shared goal. I had allocated tasks based on each team member's skills, but I confused delegation with leadership and failed to motivate the team to work together. Our initial meetings went in circles—repetitive conversation with no clarity and a lot of time wasted rehashing previous decisions—and frequently ended in turmoil. As a result, the project started with frustration and animosity. The tension between being perceived as my teammates' competent CEO and who I actually was—their grad school buddy with no prior leadership experience or training—became intolerable. I considered opting out of the whole thing.

After a few weeks, a teammate confessed to me that he found our meetings stressful, too. I finally grasped that this culture was unsettling for everyone, not just me. “Oh boy, I suck!” I thought. Something needed to change.

I turned to my go-to tool for working through my thoughts and seeking clarity: I wrote in my notebook. I reflected on our performance and how each team member was an asset. I articulated examples where everyone, myself included, could do better. I thanked them for pushing me. When I saw that what I had written actually made sense, I decided that there was nothing to do but email it to my team as what I called an “open letter from your CEO.” Maybe it would help us find a way forward, because otherwise we were going nowhere.

For a day, I could hardly bear to check my email. Then I cut myself some slack and decided I could feel proud of this appreciative, frank, vulnerable email. It felt like progress. Soon, my teammates called and thanked me for what I had written. They were relieved to learn that they were not the only ones struggling. Ultimately, the email served as a bond. And it taught me that being a leader is all about authenticity.

From there, team chemistry took off as we spoke our minds, good and bad. I found my voice as a leader, fostering an environment where we acknowledged our individual strengths and weaknesses, and where I wasn't expected to have all the answers but could nevertheless provide guidance. We read and watched everything we could find about heart transplantation, learned from webinars about startups, networked with experienced entrepreneurs, contacted national health services for data, and arranged consultations with medical experts. Then, one day, a teammate entered the meeting with his hands full of papers and his breath shallow with excitement. “This cryopreservation thing is wicked!” he exclaimed. Soon after, we came up with CryoThaw Heart, a gold nanoparticle and laser–based approach to rapidly freeze and thaw hearts. We put together our business plan, pitched it, got selected for the finals—and won our division as well as the people's choice award.

Looking back, it wasn't just a matter of how successful we turned out to be; it was also how far from successful we were at first. Our initial failures made me realize how being a leader starts with being your better self. Heartbreak doesn't have to be the end of the world. In many ways, it can be a beginning.
