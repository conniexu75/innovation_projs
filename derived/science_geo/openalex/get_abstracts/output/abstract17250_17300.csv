https://openalex.org/W2090501101,"Mice with mutations in four nonreceptor tyrosine kinase genes, fyn, src, yes, and abl, were used to study the role of these kinases in long-term potentiation (LTP) and in the relation of LTP to spatial learning and memory. All four kinases were expressed in the hippocampus. Mutations in src, yes, and abl did not interfere with either the induction or the maintenance of LTP. However, in fyn mutants, LTP was blunted even though synaptic transmission and two short-term forms of synaptic plasticity, paired-pulse facilitation and post-tetanic potentiation, were normal. In parallel with the blunting of LTP, fyn mutants showed impaired spatial learning, consistent with a functional link between LTP and learning. Although fyn is expressed at mature synapses, its lack of expression during development resulted in an increased number of granule cells in the dentate gyrus and of pyramidal cells in the CA3 region. Thus, a common tyrosine kinase pathway may regulate the growth of neurons in the developing hippocampus and the strength of synaptic plasticity in the mature hippocampus."
https://openalex.org/W2051084778,"Functionally diverse GIuR channels of the AMPA subtype are generated by the assembly of GIuR-A, -B, -C, and -D subunits into homo- and heteromeric channels. The GIuR-B subunit is dominant in determining functional properties of heteromeric AMPA receptors. This subunit exists in developmentally distinct edited and unedited forms, GIuR-B(R) and GIuR-B(Q), which differ in a single amino acid in transmembrane segment TM2 (Q/R site). Homomeric GIuR-B(R) channels expressed in 293 cells display a low divalent permeability, whereas homomeric GluR-B(Q) and GIuR-D channels exhibit a high divalent permeability. Mutational analysis revealed that both the positive charge and the size of the amino acid side chain located at the Q/R site control the divalent permeability of homomeric channels. Coexpression of Q/R site arginine- and glutamine-containing subunits generates cells with varying divalent permeabilities depending on the amounts of expression vectors used for cell transfection. Intermediate divalent permeabilities were traced to the presence of both divalent permeant homomeric and impermeant heteromeric channels. It is suggested that the positive charge contributed by the arginine of the edited GIuR-B(R) subunit determines low divalent permeability in heteromeric GIuR channels and that changes in GIuR-B(R) expression regulate the AMPA receptor-dependent divalent permeability of a cell."
https://openalex.org/W1526872663,"We expressed human MDR1 cDNA isolated from the human adrenal gland in porcine LLC-PK1 cells. A highly polarized epithelium formed by LLC-GA5-COL300 cells that expressed human P-glycoprotein specifically on the apical surface showed a multidrug-resistant phenotype and had 8.3-, 3.4-, and 6.5-fold higher net basal to apical transport of 3H-labeled cortisol, aldosterone, and dexamethasone, respectively, compared with host cells. But progesterone was not transported, although it inhibited azidopine photoaffinity labeling of human P-glycoprotein and increased the sensitivity of multidrug-resistant cells to vinblastine. An excess of progesterone inhibited the transepithelial transport of cortisol by P-glycoprotein. These results suggest that cortisol and aldosterone are physiological substrates for P-glycoprotein in the human adrenal cortex and that substances that efficiently bind to P-glycoprotein are not necessarily transported by P-glycoprotein."

https://openalex.org/W1482198038,"Tau (tau) is a major constituent of paired helical filaments (PHF) found in Alzheimer's disease. The current study examines the possibility that the distinct properties of PHF-associated tau proteins (tau PHF) result from post-translational modifications of normal soluble tau (tau s). Following hydrofluoric acid (HF) treatment, tau PHF proteins are heat- and acid-stable, soluble in 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid buffers and display the same molecular weight, pI, and immunochemical properties as normal tau s. Alkaline phosphatase treatment of dissociated PHF results in similar, although less extensive, electrophoretic changes and a reduction in PHF-1 immunoreactivity. Therefore, phosphorylation of normal tau s appears to be responsible for the distinct properties of tau PHF. Although our results suggest that all of the normal tau isoforms are in PHF, the relative abundance of individual tau species differs in HF-treated PHF and tau s samples. Moreover, the loss of PHF following HF treatment suggests that post-translational modifications contribute to the structural stability of PHF."
https://openalex.org/W2054188881,"The SWI1, SWI2, and SWI3 proteins, which are required for regulated transcription of numerous yeast genes, were found also to be essential for rat glucocorticoid receptor function in yeast; the receptor failed to activate transcription in strains with mutations in the SWI1, SWI2, or SWI3 genes. Certain mutations in genes encoding components of chromatin, identified as suppressors of swi mutations, partially relieved the SWI- requirement for receptor function. Immunoprecipitation of glucocorticoid receptor derivatives from wild-type (SWI+) yeast extracts coprecipitated the SWI3 protein; such receptor-SWI3 complexes were not detected in swi1- or swi2- mutant strains, implying that a complex of multiple SWI proteins may associate with the receptor. Prior incubation of a Drosophila embryo transcription extract with the yeast SWI3-specific antibody inhibited receptor function in vitro whereas the antibody had no effect if added after initiation complex formation. Thus, positive regulation by the glucocorticoid receptor in vivo and in vitro appears to require its interaction, at an early step, with one or more SWI proteins."

https://openalex.org/W1499693439,"Many hypertonic bacteria, plants, marine animals, and the mammalian renal medulla are protected from the deleterious effects of high intracellular concentrations of electrolytes by accumulating high concentrations of the nonperturbing osmolyte betaine. When kidney-derived Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells are cultured in hypertonic medium, they accumulate betaine to 1,000 times its medium concentration. This results from induction by hypertonicity of high rates of betaine transport into cells. We have isolated a cDNA (BGT-1) encoding a renal betaine transporter by screening an MDCK cell cDNA library for expression of a betaine transporter in Xenopus oocytes. The cDNA encodes a single protein of 614 amino acids, with an estimated molecular weight of 69 kDa. The deduced amino acid sequence exhibits highly significant sequence and topographic similarity to brain gamma-amino-n-butyric acid (GABA) and noradrenaline transporters, suggesting that the renal BGT-1 is a member of the brain GABA/noradrenaline transporter gene family. Expression in oocytes indicates that the BGT-1 protein has both betaine and GABA transport activities that are Cl(-)- as well as Na(+)-dependent and functionally similar to betaine and GABA transport in MDCK cells. Northern hybridization indicates that transporter mRNA is localized to the kidney medulla and is induced in MDCK cells by hypertonicity."

https://openalex.org/W1675282228,"Previously, we showed that the promoter of the gene encoding preproendothelin-1 (PPET-1) contains a GATA motif that is essential for activity and interacts with a nuclear factor similar in size and binding specificity to the erythroid transcription factor GATA-1. To identify this endothelial GATA-binding protein, a human endothelial cell cDNA library was screened with oligonucleotide probes for a portion of the zinc finger domain of GATA-1. A 2.6-kilobase cDNA encoding a 470 amino acid protein was obtained. Sequence analysis revealed a predicted protein which is the human counterpart of a related chicken protein, designated GATA-2. Human GATA-2 is expressed by a variety of cells, including erythroid, HeLa, and endothelial cells. A complex of a GATA-containing probe and recombinant GATA-2 expressed in COS cells comigrates with that present in gel shift experiments with nuclear extract derived from endothelial cells. In addition, expressed human GATA-2 protein transactivates reporter gene constructs containing either minimal GATA promoter elements or the native PPET-1 promoter in a cotransfection assay. Retinoic acid treatment of endothelial cells results in down-regulation of GATA-2 expression as well as down-regulation of PPET-1 gene expression. Human homologs of other known GATA-binding transcription factors are either absent from endothelial cells (in the case of GATA-1) or made in small quantities and not significantly affected by retinoid acid in these cells (in the case of GATA-3), making it unlikely that they regulate the PPET-1 gene. We propose that GATA-2 is the GATA-binding protein required for PPET-1 gene expression in endothelial cells."
https://openalex.org/W2033434600,"We have cloned a functional cDNA encoding the cyclic nucleotide-gated channel selectively expressed in cat-fish olfactory sensory neurons. The cyclic nucleotidegated channels share sequence and structural features with the family of voltage-gated ion channels. This homology is most evident in transmembrane region S4, the putative voltage sensor domain, and the H5 domain, thought to form the channel pore. We have characterized the single-channel properties of the cloned catfish channel and compared these properties with the channel in native catfish olfactory sensory neurons. The channel is activated equally well by cAMP and cGMP, shows only a slight voltage dependence of gating, and exhibits a pH-and voltage-dependent subconductance state similar to that observed for the voltage-gated L-type calcium channel."
https://openalex.org/W2072367309,"Changes in intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) in the soma and dendrites of hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons were measured using intracellularly injected fura-2. A large component of the [Ca2+]i elevation caused by high frequency stimulation of the Schaffer collaterals was correlated with the Na+ spikes triggered by the excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs). These spikes were generated in the soma and proximal dendrites and stimulated Ca2+ entry through voltage-gated Ca2+ channels. Suppressing spikes by hyperpolarizing the soma or by injecting QX-314 revealed a smaller nonspike component of Ca2+ entry. A substantial fraction of this component was mediated by the action of the EPSPs on voltage-gated Ca2+ channels, because it persisted in 2-amino-5-phosphonovaleric acid and because it was usually reduced when Ca2+ channel activity was suppressed by hyperpolarization. Ca2+ entry through the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor channel could not be detected with certainty, perhaps because it was highly localized."
https://openalex.org/W2024986310,"We have studied the role of Ca2+ entry via voltage-sensitive Ca2+ channels in long-term potentiation (LTP) in the CA1 region of the hippocampus. Repeated depolarizing pulses, in the presence of the NMDA receptor antagonist D-APV and without synaptic stimulation, resulted in a potentiation of excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) or currents (EPSCs). This depolarization-induced potentiation was augmented in raised extracellular Ca2+ and was blocked by intracellular BAPTA, a Ca2+ chelator, or by nifedipine, a Ca2+ channel antagonist, indicating that the effect was mediated by Ca2+ entry via voltage-sensitive Ca2+ channels. Although the peak potentiation could be as large as 3-fold, the EPSP(C)s decayed back to baseline values within approximately 30 min. However, synaptic activation paired with depolarizing pulses in the presence of d-APV converted the transient potentiation into a sustained form. These results indicate that a rise in postsynaptic Ca2+ via voltage-sensitive Ca2+ channels can transiently potentiate synaptic transmission, but that another factor associated with synaptic transmission may be required for LTP."
https://openalex.org/W1506057274,"A 1.9-kb cDNA clone to chick lumican (keratan sulfate proteoglycan) was isolated by screening an expressing vector library made from chick corneal RNA with antiserum to chick corneal lumican. The cDNA clone contained an open reading frame coding for a 343-amino acid protein, Mr = 38,640. Structural features of the deduced sequence include: a 18-amino acid signal peptide, cysteine residues at the N- and C-terminal regions, and a central leucine-rich region (comprising 62% of the protein) containing nine repeats of the sequence LXXLXLXXNXL/I, where X represents any amino acid. Lumican contains three variations of this sequence that are tandemly linked to form a unit and three units tandemly linked to form the leucine-rich region. The sequential arrangement of these repeats and their spacing suggest that this region arose by duplication. The deduced sequence shows five potential N-linked glycosylation sites, four of which are in the leucine-rich region. These sites are also potential keratan sulfate attachment sites. The cDNA clone to lumican hybridizes to a 2.0-kb mRNA found in tissues other than cornea, predominantly muscle and intestine. Radiolabeling and immunoprecipitation studies show that lumican core protein is also synthesized by these tissues. The primary structure of lumican is similar to fibromodulin, decorin, and biglycan, which indicates it belongs to the small interstitial proteoglycan gene family. The expression of lumican in tissues other than cornea indicates a broader role for lumican besides contributing to corneal transparency."

https://openalex.org/W2162169187,"A permanent transgenic mouse line was generated carrying 40 copies of the human Hox3.3 gene. The resulting mice express large amounts of Hox3.3 protein in posterior regions of the embryo where this homeodomain protein is normally not expressed. The transgene causes homeotic transformations of the skeleton, in particular the appearance of an extra pair of ribs in the lumbar region, transformation of the shape of posterior ribs into that of more anterior ones, and the joining of an additional pair of ribs to the sternum. The phenotype of this line resembles that obtained by the targeted loss-of-function mutation of Hox3.1 (Le Mouellic et al., 1992). In transient assays, the human Hox3.3 transgene leads to the formation of additional ribs in more posterior vertebrae as well."
https://openalex.org/W1566157309,"zeta-Crystallin is a major protein in the lens of certain mammals. In guinea pigs it comprises 10% of the total lens protein, and it has been shown that a mutation in the zeta-crystallin gene is associated with autosomal dominant congenital cataract. As with several other lens crystallins of limited phylogenetic distribution, zeta-crystallin has been characterized as an enzyme/crystallin based on its ability to reduce catalytically the electron acceptor 2,6-dichlorophenolindophenol. We report here that certain naturally occurring quinones are good substrates for the enzymatic activity of zeta-crystallin. Among the various quinones tested, the orthoquinones 1,2-naphthoquinone and 9,10-phenanthrenequinone were the best substrates whereas menadione, ubiquinone, 9,10-anthraquinone, vitamins K1 and K2 were inactive as substrates. This quinone reductase activity was NADPH specific and exhibited typical Michaelis-Menten kinetics. Activity was sensitive to heat and sulfhydryl reagents but was very stable on freezing. Dicumarol (Ki = 1.3 x 10(-5) M) and nitrofurantoin (Ki = 1.4 x 10(-5) M) inhibited the activity competitively with respect to the electron acceptor, quinone. NADPH protected the enzyme against inactivation caused by heat, N-ethylmaleimide, or H2O2. Electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy of the reaction products showed formation of a semiquinone radical. The enzyme activity was associated with O2 consumption, generation of O2- and H2O2, and reduction of ferricytochrome c. These properties indicate that the enzyme acts through a one-electron transfer process. The substrate specificity, reaction characteristics, and physicochemical properties of zeta-crystallin demonstrate that it is an active NADPH:quinone oxidoreductase distinct from quinone reductases described previously."

Vaginal immunization with simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) had not yet been studied in nonhuman primates. Immune responses in macaques were investigated by stimulation of the genital and gut-associated lymphoid tissue with a recombinant, particulate SIV antigen. Vaginal, followed by oral, administration of the vaccine elicited three types of immunity: (i) gag protein p27-specific, secretory immunoglobulin A (IgA) and immunoglobulin G (IgG) in the vaginal fluid, (ii) specific CD4+ T cell proliferation and helper function in B cell p27-specific IgA synthesis in the genital lymph nodes, and (iii) specific serum IgA and IgG, with CD4+ T cell proliferative and helper functions in the circulating blood."
https://openalex.org/W1543226133,"P-glycoprotein (P-gp) is believed to function as an ATP-dependent efflux pump for natural product anti-cancer drugs in multidrug-resistant (MDR) tumor cells and in certain normal tissues. P-gp has been localized to the apical plasma membrane of the bile canaliculus where it has been shown to transport [3H]daunomycin. In this study, we investigated whether alterations in membrane lipid fluidity of canalicular membrane vesicles (CMV) could modulate the P-gp-mediated accumulation of [3H]daunomycin and [3H]vinblastine. Accumulation of both cytotoxic agents was stimulated by ATP, exhibited temperature dependence and osmotic sensitivity, and followed Michaelis-Menten kinetics. Alterations in CMV lipid fluidity were induced by the known fluidizers, 2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethyl 8-(cis-2-n-octylcyclopropyl)octanoate (A2C) and benzyl alcohol, and were assessed by fluorescence polarization techniques using the fluorescent probe, 1,6-diphenyl-1,3,5-hexatriene (DPH). Both A2C (2.5-5.0 microM) and benzyl alcohol (10-20 mM) produced a dose-dependent increase in CMV lipid fluidity. Moreover, both fluidizers, at the above doses, significantly inhibited (p < 0.05) the ATP-dependent accumulation of [3H]daunomycin. [3H]Vinblastine accumulation was also inhibited by A2C (p < 0.05). Lower doses of A2C (0.6 microM) and benzyl alcohol (1 mM) failed to influence either lipid fluidity or P-gp-mediated drug accumulation. Kinetic analysis revealed that A2C (5.0 microM) noncompetitively inhibited [3H]daunomycin accumulation and uncompetitively inhibited [3H]vinblastine accumulation with apparent Ki values of approximately 1.5 and approximately 1.2 microM, respectively. Verapamil competitively inhibited P-gp-mediated accumulation of [3H]daunomycin but failed to alter the fluidity of CMV. Taken together, the present results demonstrate that while increases in membrane fluidity of CMV are not necessarily required to inhibit P-gp-mediated drug accumulation, they can inhibit these processes, at least in CMV. Alterations in the physical state of CMV, therefore, appear to be at least one important modulator of P-gp function."
https://openalex.org/W2035937996,A secreted form of a class I major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecule was denatured and renatured in vitro in the absence of peptide. The resulting empty class I heterodimer was immunologically reactive and structurally similar to a heterodimer renatured in the presence of an appropriate restricted peptide. Thermal stability profiles indicated that the two forms of heterodimer differed in their resistance to denaturation by heat but that a significant portion of the empty class I heterodimers had a native conformation at physiological temperatures. Free energies calculated from these data gave a direct measure of the stabilization of the class I MHC molecule that resulted from peptide binding.
https://openalex.org/W1990278701,"To investigate the function of region-specific patterns of mouse homeobox gene expression during embryogenesis, we programmed a minimal change in the distribution of Hox3.1 transcripts along the anteroposterior body axis in transgenic mice. Regulatory sequences from Hox1.4, a gene normally expressed more anteriorly than Hox3.1, were chosen to direct expression of a Hox3.1 transgene. Offspring of independent transgenic lines expressed the transgene more anteriorly than the Hox3.1 gene. Rather than predicted posterior transformations, we observed anterior transformations of vertebrae in newborn mice. Transgenic mice also developed profound gastrointestinal tissue malformations, which may provide a molecular explanation for human developmental disorders often involving these same two regions. Paradoxically, vertebral transformations in the transgenic mice were strikingly similar to those reported in mice homozygous for a null mutation of the Hox3.1 gene. This observation suggests that Hox genes may be regulated antipodally, with over- or underexpression resulting in similar phenotypes."
https://openalex.org/W1597592755,"Neuropeptide Y, peptide YY, and pancreatic polypeptide are homologous 36-amino acid peptides that differ from most other peptide transmitters by having a relatively rigid conformation in aqueous solutions, defined as the pancreatic polypeptide fold, and a critical C-terminal tyrosine amide. These peptides serve as gastrointestinal hormones and neurotransmitters. A cDNA encoding a novel G protein-coupled receptor activated by neuropeptide Y was cloned from Drosophila by use of degenerate oligonucleotide primers and polymerase chain reaction amplification of cDNA prepared from transcripts expressed early in embryogenesis. The cDNA encodes a protein of 449 amino acids with the characteristics of a G protein-coupled receptor and shares significant amino acid identity with mammalian tachykinin receptors. When expressed in Xenopus oocytes, the PR4 protein is activated by mammalian neuropeptides in the order: peptide YY greater than neuropeptide Y much greater than pancreatic polypeptide. Northern analysis showed that PR4 receptor is expressed at equivalent levels in adult Drosophila head and body and that the expression of the PR4 receptor is regulated during development. The molecular characterization of this receptor should lead to a better understanding of the functional role of this important family of hormone receptors in adult organisms and during development."

https://openalex.org/W1519825607,"Dopaminergic D2 receptor agonists, such as bromocriptine, are potent anti-proliferative agents in the treatment of human pituitary adenomas. We have reproduced the anti-proliferative effect of dopamine in an established pituitary cell line stably transfected with the rat D2 dopamine receptor cDNA. We found that dopaminergic inhibition of DNA synthesis parallels the stimulation of a phosphotyrosine phosphatase activity. Both actions are blocked by pertussis toxin and by the phosphotyrosine phosphatase inhibitor, vanadate. We suggest that the anti-proliferative action of dopamine is mediated, at least in part, by the dopaminergic stimulation of a phosphotyrosine phosphatase."
https://openalex.org/W1497378428,"A synthetic RNA transcript containing the entire sequence of one of the two natural mRNAs for Escherichia coli ribosomal protein S20 is a substrate for specific cleavage by an endonuclease which is or depends on ribonuclease E (Mackie, G. A. (1991) J. Bacteriol. 173, 2488-2497). Partial cleavage with ribonucleases T1 or CL3 and limited modification with dimethyl sulfate have been employed to identify residues that are likely to be single stranded in the S20 mRNA's native state. The data show that the 5' one-third of the mRNA is relatively unstructured whereas the 3' one-third is extensively folded. The latter property can account for the previously observed accumulation of a 147-residue product co-terminal with the 3' end of the S20 mRNA (Mackie, G. A. (1989) J. Bacteriol. 171, 4112-4120). Sites of cleavage by the ribonuclease E-dependent activity map to single-stranded regions of the RNA. In addition, denaturation of the RNA substrate results in loss of susceptibility to the ribonuclease E-dependent activity and simultaneous loss of the single-stranded character of the two most prominent cleavage sites. It is proposed that ribonuclease E is a single-strand-specific enzyme with few primary structural constraints but a preference for an AU dinucleotide 3' to the site of cleavage."
https://openalex.org/W1605701068,"Peptides corresponding to amino acids 321-339 (peptide GS21) and 416-431 (peptide GS31) of the cGMP-gated channel from bovine rod photoreceptors were synthesized and used as antigens for the preparation of polyclonal antibodies. After affinity purification, both antipeptide antibodies were found to bind specifically to the channel protein after Western blotting, but only the antibody against GS21 gave satisfactory results on enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and electron microscopy. Using immunocytochemistry, we were able to localize amino acids 321-339 to the extracellular side of the rod photoreceptor plasma membrane. By synthesizing heptapeptides corresponding to amino acids 324-330 (peptide GS2s) and 420-426 (peptide GS3s), we were able to affinity purify antibodies specific for two N-glycosylation consensus sites in the channel protein. As assessed by Western blotting, antibodies against GS3s were found to bind to both the glycosylated and deglycosylated channel proteins, whereas antibodies against GS2s only bound to the channel protein after enzymatic deglycosylation. Together, these results allow the refinement of folding models for the cGMP-gated channel and implicate Asn-327 as being the sole site of N-glycosylation."
https://openalex.org/W1510086989,"The molecular basis of thermal stability of globular proteins is a highly significant yet unsolved problem. The most promising approach to its solution is the investigation of the structure-function relationship of homologous enzymes from mesophilic and thermophilic sources. In this context, D-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase has been the most extensively studied model system. In the present study, the most thermostable homolog isolated so far is described with special emphasis on the stability of the enzyme under varying solvent conditions. D-Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase from the hyperthermophilic eubacterium Thermotoga maritima is an intrinsically thermostable enzyme with a thermal transition temperature around 110 degrees C. The amino acid sequence, electrophoresis, and sedimentation analysis prove the enzyme to be a homotetramer with a gross structure similar to its mesophilic counterparts. The enzyme in the absence and in the presence of its coenzyme, NAD+, exhibits no drastic structural differences except for a 3% change in sedimentation velocity reflecting slight alterations in the quaternary structure of the enzyme. At low temperature, in the absence of denaturants, neither cold nor subunit dissociation are detectable. Guanidinium chloride and pH-dependent deactivation precede the decrease in fluorescence emission and ellipticity, suggesting a complex denaturation mechanism. An up to 3-fold activation of the enzyme at low guanidinium concentration may be interpreted in terms of a compensation of the tight packing of the thermophilic enzyme at low temperature. Under destabilizing conditions, e.g. moderate concentrations of chaotropic agents, low temperature favors denaturation. The effect becomes important in reconstitution experiments after preceding guanidinium denaturation; the reactivation yield at low temperature drops to zero, whereas between 35 and 80 degrees C reactivation exceeds 80%. Shifting the temperature from approximately 0 degrees C to greater than or equal to 30 degrees C releases a trapped tetrameric intermediate in a fast reaction. Concentration-dependent reactivation experiments prove renaturation of the enzyme to involve consecutive folding and association steps. Reconstitution at room temperature yields the native protein, in spite of the fact that the temperature of the processes in vitro and in vivo differ by more than 60 degrees C."
https://openalex.org/W1518319381,"NGFI-A is an immediate-early response gene induced by signals that initiate growth and differentiation. Its mRNA encodes a sequence-specific transcriptional activator possibly implicated in the control of brain developmental processes. Due to the essential role of thyroid hormone for a correct brain development, we have now investigated the possible regulation by 3,5,3'-triiodo-L-thyronine (T3) of NGFI-A gene expression during maturation of the central nervous system. Our results indicate that expression of mRNA encoding NGFI-A transcription factor is about 8-fold decreased in the brain of neonatal hypothyroid rats. No changes were seen when hypothyroidism was induced in adult life. T3 treatment increased NGFI-A mRNA within 1 h, suggesting that thyroid hormone effect is likely to be a direct one. These data indicate a strong regulation by thyroid hormone of the expression of the growth factor inducible gene NGFI-A during brain development, making this gene a suitable model to study T3 action in the early developing nervous system."
https://openalex.org/W1520765192,"A microphysiometer was used to quantify the rate of extracellular acidification by C6 glioma cells and L fibroblasts expressing recombinant dopamine D2 receptors. The dopamine D2 receptor agonist, quinpirole, accelerated the rate of acidification of the medium by C6 cells expressing either the short or long form of D2 receptors, D2(415) and D2(444), but not by wild-type cells that were not transfected with a D2 receptor cDNA. The rate of acidification increased with increasing concentrations of quinpirole up to 100 nM. Inhibition of the response by the dopamine D2 antagonist, spiperone, provided additional evidence that the enhanced extracellular acidification resulted from stimulation of D2 receptors. To test the hypothesis that D2 receptor-stimulated extracellular acidification was due to transport of protons by a Na+/H+ antiporter and reflected intracellular alkalinization, the effect of two inhibitors of Na+/H+ exchange, amiloride and methyl-isobutyl-amiloride, was determined. Both compounds inhibited quinpirole-induced extracellular acidification at concentrations that did not alter D2 receptor-mediated inhibition of adenylylcyclase or radioligand binding to D2 receptors. In addition, quinpirole-induced extracellular acidification was greatly inhibited by removal of sodium from the extracellular medium, confirming the participation of Na+/H+ exchange in the extrusion of acid. Quinpirole (100 nM) also increased the rate of extracellular acidification by L cells expressing D2(415), LZR1 cells. Treatment with pertussis toxin (100 ng/ml for 18 h) had no effect on the quinpirole-induced acid extrusion by C6D2(415) and LZR1 cells, although the same pertussis toxin treatment regimen completely prevented inhibition of adenylylcyclase. We conclude that recombinant D2 receptors accelerate Na+/H+ exchange in C6 cells and L fibroblasts by a pathway that does not involve inhibition of adenylylcyclase or pertussis toxin-sensitive G proteins."

L., Busso, M., Tan, C.-K., Reusser, F., Palmer, J. R., Poppe, S. M., Aristoff, P. A., Downey, K. M., So, A. G., Resnick, L., and Tarpley, W. G. (1991) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 88, 8806-8810). Here we show that the radiolabeled BHAP [3H]U-88204 binds specifically to HIV-1 RT with high affinity (KD of 50 nM) and a stoichiometry of 1 mol of U-88204 per 1 mol of p66/p51 RT heterodimer. Binding of [3H]U-88204 to RT is unaffected by the presence of saturating poly(rC).oligo (dG)12-18 template-primer. Direct measurement of competition between [3H]U-88204 and other RT inhibitors for binding to RT reveals mutually exclusive competition between [3H]U-88204 and the non-nucleoside RT inhibitor BI-RG-587 (Kopp, E. B., Miglietta, J. J., Shrutkowski, A. G., Shih, C.-K., Grob, P. M. and Skoog, M.T. (1991) Nucleic Acids Res. 19, 3035-3039), indicating that both share the same binding site. Phosphonoformate in concentrations up to 50 microM shows no competition with [3H]U-88204 for binding to RT either alone or in the presence of template-primer. Dideoxynucleotide RT inhibitors affect the binding of [3H]U-88204 to RT when complementary template-primer is present. [3H]U-88204 and the dideoxynucleotide ddGTP can bind RT simultaneously, but the presence of one ligand decreases the affinity of RT for the second. Inasmuch as ddGTP approximates the nucleotide substrate of RT, the direct demonstration of an RT-dideoxynucleotide-[3H]U-88204 complex validates the use of indirect kinetic methods to assess the strength of BHAP interaction with RT and suggests that RT inhibition by U-88204 is achieved via effects on nucleotide substrate binding."

In examining the basis for nonlinear whole-cell current-voltage curves in Mg2+-free solutions we discovered that N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) channels in excised patches reversibly shifted their open-state probability (Po) in a voltage-dependent way, exhibiting approximately 3- to 4-fold greater Pa at positive potentials than at rest. Changes in Po were mainly attributable to shifts in frequency of channel opening. Po changed remarkably slowly (2–15 min), explaining the hysteresis of wholecell current-voltage curves obtained in nonequilibrium conditions. The slow increase in Po provides a mechanism by which NMDA channels can substantially increase Ca2+ influx in cells depolarized for prolonged periods of time and may play a role in excitotoxicity."
https://openalex.org/W1561592638,"Structural analogs of recombinant human insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I), with alterations to each of the B, C, A, and D domains, have been tested for their ability to form binary complexes with IGF-binding protein-3 (IGFBP-3) and ternary complexes with IGFBP-3 and the acid-labile subunit (alpha-subunit). Two functionally distinct regions of IGF-I have been identified. The first, involving residues 3 and 4 and the alpha-helix between residues 8 and 18 of the B-domain, as well as residues 49-51 in the A-domain, appears important for IGFBP-3 binding, such that substitution of these residues results in decreased binary complex available for alpha-subunit binding. The second region, distal to the IGFBP-3-binding epitope and primarily involving the D-domain and B-domain near residue 24, with some involvement of the C-domain, appears slightly inhibitory to binary complex formation, such that analogs with a truncated D-domain or with a Gly4 bridge substituted for the C-domain show enhanced binding to IGFBP-3. However, binary complexes formed from these analogs bind the alpha-subunit with reduced affinity, the effect being most marked when substitution of the C-domain, or replacement of Tyr24, is superimposed on D-domain truncation. It is concluded that although the alpha-subunit does not itself bind IGF-I, its interaction with IGFBP-3 in the ternary complex is dependent on structural determinants on IGF-I distal to the IGFBP-3 binding domain."
https://openalex.org/W1590783189,"The gastric H,K-ATPase (EC 3.6.1.3) is responsible for acid secretion into the stomach and is composed of two subunits, alpha and beta. The structure of the gene encoding the mouse beta subunit and the expression of both subunits during ontogeny are reported. The gene spans approximately 12 kilobase pairs and contains 7 exons. The positions at which introns interrupt the coding regions of the mouse H,K-ATPase beta subunit and mouse Na,K-ATPase (EC 3.6.1.37) beta 2 subunit genes are identical. The alternative beta subunit isoform of the Na,K-ATPase, beta 1, has a similar but not identical gene structure. Primer extension and S1 nuclease analysis of RNA isolated from mouse stomachs aged between 2 and 25 days indicated that major transcription-initiation sites are between 22 and 25 base pairs 5' of the translation initiation site at all ages. The expression of the H,K-ATPase alpha and beta subunit genes during ontogeny (day 1-40) was found to be co-ordinated. Protein levels of both the ATPase alpha and beta subunits were very low until day 15 and then increased to adult levels by day 30. In any mucosal cell throughout ontogeny, expression of the beta subunit gene invariably coincided with the expression of the alpha subunit gene. Cells detected by anti-H,K-ATPase beta subunit antibodies in sections from 10- and 30-day-old mice all had typical morphology of parietal cells and were arranged in glandular structures. Co-ordinate expression of the two subunit genes suggest that the regulatory mechanisms will be similar and that the beta subunit may be required for localization and function of the catalytic alpha subunit."
https://openalex.org/W1522846935,"Ninety percent of variant medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (MCAD) alleles in patients with MCAD deficiency carry a 985 A-->G transition which causes glutamate substitution for lysine 329 in precursor (p) MCAD (K-304 in mature MCAD). We have used site-directed mutagenesis to produce three variant cDNAs encoding variant pMCAD with glutamate (Kp329E2), aspartate (Kp329D), or arginine (Kp329R) substitution for Kp329. We carried out in vitro expression of cDNAs, and incubated the translation products with isolated rat liver mitochondria. Kp329E was imported into mitochondria and processed into the mature subunit as efficiently as wild-type. Gel filtration analysis of the mitochondria revealed that at 10 min after import, markedly more K304E eluted as a monomer than did wild-type, and the amount of K304E tetramer formed was distinctly less than wild-type at any point up to 60 min after import, indicating that the assembly of K304E is defective. After further incubation, K304E decayed more rapidly than did wild-type, indicating a reduced stability. In similar studies, K304R behaved like the wild-type, while K304D closely resembled K304E, indicating that the presence of a basic residue at 304 is essential for tetramer formation and intramitochondrial stability of mature MCAD."
https://openalex.org/W1607856013,"Efficient formation of the cpn60-rhodanese complex can be achieved by mixing unfolded rhodanese with excess cpn60 at low temperature. By employing these conditions, a stable and highly reactivatable complex is formed. The complex is not formed when native enzyme is used. Concentrations of NaCl, as high as 0.75 M, do not have any effect on the formation or disruption of the binary complex. cpn60-bound rhodanese contains an exposed hydrophobic surface, as detected by the binding of the fluorescent reporter, 1-anilinonaphthalene-8-sulfonic acid. The intrinsic fluorescence of cpn60-bound rhodanese reports that the average tryptophan is in an intermediate environment between that found in unfolded and native states. This form of rhodanese has an accessibility to quenching by acrylamide or iodide that is intermediate between the unfolded and native forms of the enzyme. Protease susceptibility studies show that rhodanese bound to cpn60 exhibits a trypsin digestion pattern similar to the native enzyme, although it is more rapidly proteolyzed. The results suggest that the conformation of cpn60-bound rhodanese resembles a native-like conformation, but with increased flexibility. Further, only intact rhodanese or enzyme lacking its N-terminal sequence can interact with cpn60 and form a stable binary complex. The protein fragment corresponding to the rhodanese N-terminal sequence did not form part of a stable complex with cpn60."
https://openalex.org/W1639198537,"The inositol ring in the glycoinositolphospholipid (GPI) anchor of human decay-accelerating factor (DAF) is unmodified in nucleated cells, whereas it is fatty acid acylated in erythrocytes (Ehu). To assess the effect of this and of the glycerol sn-2-associated acyl substituent on the abilities of DAF to cell membrane incorporate and function, 1) endogenous (physiologically anchored) DAF proteins bearing three- and two-footed GPI anchors were purified from Ehu and HeLa cells and 2) synthetic DAF variants bearing alternative one- footed anchors (retaining either the sn-1 glycerol- or inositol-associated lipid) were prepared by alkaline hydroxylamine treatment and phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase D digestion of Ehu DAF, respectively. The different DAF species were added to antibody-sensitized sheep erythrocytes (EshA) and their abilities to insert into the plasma membranes of the cells and control subsequent complement activation on their surfaces were compared. DAF proteins bearing all four GPI anchor structures adhered to the Esh hemolytic intermediates and inhibited expression of C3 convertase (C4b2a) activity. However, mixing of DAF-treated EshA with untreated EshAC142 and stripping of cell-associated DAF proteins with vesicles showed that only the physiologically anchored proteins remained stably associated with the lipid bilayer and functioned intrinsically. Both three- and two-footed Ehu and HeLa DAF proteins exhibited comparable ability to incorporate and function in the intermediates as well as to accumulate to levels 1000-fold higher/cell in Schistosoma mansoni schistosomula. These findings indicate that 1) an intact inositolphospholipid-containing GPI anchor is necessary for stable membrane integration and intrinsic function, 2) endogenous GPI anchors (with either unsubstituted and acylated inositol) incorporate and function with comparable efficiency, and 3) the transfer of either endogenous DAF form can account for the previously described circumvented uptake of human C3b by blood stage schistosomula."
https://openalex.org/W1538735723,"The effect of Ca2+ on the rate of pyruvate carboxylation was studied in liver mitochondria from control and glucagon-treated rats, prepared under conditions that maintain low Ca2+ levels (1-3 nmol/mg of protein). When the matrix-free [Ca2+] was low (less than 100 nM), the rate of pyruvate carboxylation was not significantly different in mitochondria from control and glucagon-treated rats. Accumulation of 5-8 nmol of Ca2+/mg, which increased the matrix [Ca2+] to 2-5 microM in both preparations, significantly enhanced pyruvate carboxylase flux by 20-30% in the mitochondria from glucagon-treated rats, but had little effect in control preparations. Higher levels of Ca2+ (up to 75 nmol/mg) inhibited pyruvate carboxylation in both preparations, but the difference between the mitochondria from control and glucagon-treated animals was maintained. The enhancement of pyruvate dehydrogenase flux by mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake was also significantly greater in mitochondria from glucagon-treated rats. These differential effects of Ca2+ uptake on enzyme fluxes did not correlate with changes in the mitochondrial ATP/ADP ratio, the pyrophosphate level, or the matrix volume. Arsenite completely prevented 14CO2 incorporation when pyruvate was the only substrate, but caused only partial inhibition when succinate and acetyl carnitine were present as alternative sources of energy and acetyl-CoA. Under these conditions, mitochondria from glucagon-treated rats were less sensitive to arsenite than the control preparations, even at low Ca2+ levels. We conclude that the Ca(2+)-dependent enhancement of pyruvate carboxylation in mitochondria from glucagon-treated rats is a secondary consequence of pyruvate dehydrogenase activation; glucagon treatment is suggested to affect the conditions in the mitochondria that change the sensitivity of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex to dephosphorylation by the Ca(2+)-sensitive pyruvate dehydrogenase phosphatase."
https://openalex.org/W1482532981,"At inflammatory sites, neutrophils are stimulated by a range of proinflammatory molecules which elicit a number of cellular responses. Considerable information on the cytoplasmic events that occur following activation of neutrophils at the cell membrane level already exists. In this study, we have focused on the ability of neutrophil agonists to initiate nuclear signaling events by investigating the induction of de novo RNA synthesis. Of a total of 14 different known potent leukocyte agonists, only three had a significant effect on the induction of RNA synthesis in neutrophils; the formylated oligopeptide formyl-methionyl-leucylphenylalanine (fMet-Leu-Phe), granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, and tumor necrosis factor alpha. All three agonists induced de novo RNA synthesis in neutrophils at concentrations known to be optimal for the activation of a number of other cellular responses occurring in inflammation. Of significance was the observation that activation of RNA synthesis in neutrophils is a G-protein-mediated event, is also dependent on tyrosine phosphorylation, but is not influenced by cAMP. Finally, we have demonstrated that all three agonists also induce de novo synthesis of a limited number of proteins, with granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor and fMet-Leu-Phe having the most potent effect. These studies define the effects of neutrophil agonists on de novo RNA and protein synthesis in a proinflammatory context and suggest that these events in neutrophils occur in a restricted fashion, highly dependent on the stimuli present at sites of inflammation."
https://openalex.org/W1521813256,"Rod outer segments from bovine retina contain a higher level of intracellular inorganic pyrophosphatase (EC 3.6.1.1) activity than has been found in any other mammalian tissue; the specific activity in extracts of soluble outer segment proteins is more than 6-fold higher than in extracts from bovine liver and more than 24-fold higher than in skeletal muscle extracts. This high activity may be necessary to keep inorganic pyrophosphate concentrations low in the face of the high rates of pyrophosphate production that accompany the cGMP flux driving phototransduction. We have begun to explore the role of inorganic pyrophosphatase in photoreceptor cGMP metabolism by 1) studying the kinetic properties of this enzyme and its interactions with divalent metal ions and anionic inhibitors, 2) purifying it and studying its size and subunit composition, and 3) examining the effects of pyrophosphate on rod outer segment guanylyl cyclase. Km for magnesium pyrophosphate was 0.9-1.5 microM, and the purified enzyme hydrolyzed > 885 mumol of PPi min-1 mg-1. The enzyme appears to be a homodimer of 36-kilodalton subunits when analyzed by gel electrophoresis and density gradient centrifugation, implying that kcat = 10(3) s-1, and kcat/Km = 0.7-1 x 10(9) M-1 s-1. The enzyme was inhibited by Ca2+ at submicromolar levels: 28% inhibition was observed at 138 nM [Ca2+], and 53% inhibition at 700 nM [Ca2+]. Imidodiphosphate acted as a competitive inhibitor, with Ki = 1.2 microM, and fluoride inhibited half-maximally approximately 20 microM. Inhibition studies on rod outer segment guanylyl cyclase confirmed previous reports that pyrophosphate inhibits guanylyl cyclase, suggesting an essential role for inorganic pyrophosphatase in maintaining cGMP metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W1545035503,"To facilitate folding and assembly of different proteins, chaperonin GroEL requires the presence of its helper protein GroES. Using a photochemical cross-linking approach, we show that GroES and newly synthesized pre-beta-lactamase (pre-beta lac) contact with each other only within the ternary complex with GroEL. Possibly owing to this contact GroES is able to directly influence the pre-beta lac/GroEL interaction. Furthermore, the cross-linking of pre-beta lac to GroES suggests that the binding of the protein ligands to GroEL occurs near the GroES binding site, known to be in the central hole space of GroEL."
https://openalex.org/W1560194512,"Abstract We have investigated the role of serine 40 (Ser-40) in tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) catalysis of basal and activated enzymes by protein kinase A (PKA)-mediated phosphorylation. Wild type and mutant TH were transiently and stably expressed in AtT-20 cells, and the enzymatic activities of the recombinant enzymes were analyzed. The specific enzymatic activity of transiently expressed TH mutants Ser-40-->leucine or-->tyrosine (Leu-40m or Tyr-40m) was higher than that of the wild type enzyme or of other mutants in which Ser-8, -19, and -31 were replaced by leucine. The kinetic studies carried out with the stably expressed TH show that the Km for the cofactor 6-methyltetrahydropterine is lower and the Ki for dopamine is higher when the enzymatic hydroxylation is catalyzed by the Leu-40m or Tyr-40m than by the wild type enzyme. The kinetic parameters and the pH profile of the enzymatic hydroxylation catalyzed by the Leu-40m or Tyr-40m are similar to the enzyme activated by PKA-mediated phosphorylation. We suggest that Ser-40 in TH exerts an inhibitory influence on the enzymatic activity, and its replacement with another amino acid by site-directed mutagenesis or its modification by phosphorylation leads to a change in conformation with an increased enzymatic activity. The importance of Ser-40 in the activation of TH by PKA-mediated phosphorylation was investigated by comparing the activation of the wild type enzyme with that of Leu-40m or Tyr-40m. The findings that the enzymatic activity is increased by PKA-mediated phosphorylation of the wild type enzyme, but not of the Leu-40m or Tyr-40m, demonstrate that phosphorylation at Ser-40 is essential for activation of TH by PKA. The findings that addition of ATP plus cAMP to homogenates from transfected AtT-20 cells stimulates the recombinant wild type TH activity indicate that these cells contain endogenous cAMP-dependent protein kinase."
https://openalex.org/W1557958060,"Chemical modification of HIV-1 and HIV-2 (human immunodeficiency virus, types 1 and 2) reverse transcriptases (RT) with three thiol reactive compounds selectively inhibits the RNase H function of the enzyme. HIV-1 RT has 2 cysteines (at positions 38 and 280); HIV-2 RT has 3 (38, 280, 445). Both of the cysteines in HIV-1 RT are in the polymerase domain. To investigate the role of the cysteines in the structure and function of the HIV RTs, we have converted each cysteine to serine and made combinations of the mutations. Since HIV-1 RT has alanine at position 445, we have also substituted alanine for serine at this position in HIV-2 RT. Neither of the single mutations in HIV-1 RT nor the double mutation mimics the effects of the chemical modification. The serine 280 mutation has little effect on either polymerase or RNase H; the serine 38 mutation affects both activities, as does the 38/280 double mutant. The 38 and 280 serine mutations in HIV-2 RT resemble the equivalent mutations in HIV-1 RT. Substitution of serine or alanine at position 445 (which lies in the RNase H domain) diminishes, but does not abolish, the RNase H activity of HIV-2 without affecting polymerase activity. The RNase H activity of a mutant HIV-1 RT with serine at position 280 is completely resistant to inactivation by the three thiol reactive compounds we tested, which demonstrates that cysteine 280 is the critical residue. We suggest that the reason the mutation (cysteine 280 to serine) does not mimic the chemical modification is because the chemical modification produces a greater change in the structure of the protein. We also suggest that position 280 lies at or near the important points of contact between the RNase H and polymerase domains, so that chemical modification of this position, which lies within the polymerase domain, distorts the RNase H domain."
https://openalex.org/W1563826643,"Mitochondrial F1-ATPases purified from several dicotyledonous plants contain six different subunits of alpha, beta, gamma, delta, delta' and epsilon. Previous N-terminal amino acid sequence analyses indicated that the gamma-, delta-, and epsilon-subunits of the sweet potato mitochondrial F1 correspond to the gamma-subunit, the oligomycin sensitivity-conferring protein and the epsilon-subunit of animal mitochondrial F1F0 complex (Kimura, T., Nakamura, K., Kajiura, H., Hattori, H., Nelson, N., and Asahi, T. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 3183-3186). However, the N-terminal amino acid sequence of the delta'-subunit did not show any obvious homologies with known protein sequences. A cDNA clone for the delta'-subunit of the sweet potato mitochondrial F1 was identified by oligonucleotide-hybridization selection of a cDNA library. The 1.0-kilobase-long cDNA contained a 600-base pair open reading frame coding for a precursor for the delta'-subunit. The precursor for the delta'-subunit contained N-terminal presequence of 21-amino acid residues. The mature delta'-subunit is composed of 179 amino acids and its sequence showed similarities of about 31-36% amino acid positional identity with the delta-subunit of animal and fungal mitochondrial F1 and about 18-25% with the epsilon-subunit of bacterial F1 and chloroplast CF1. The sweet potato delta'-subunit contains N-terminal sequence of about 45-amino acid residues that is absent in other related subunits. It is concluded that the six-subunit plant mitochondrial F1 contains the subunit that is homologous to the oligomycin sensitivity-conferring protein as one of the component in addition to five subunits that are homologous to subunits of animal mitochondrial F1."
https://openalex.org/W2117812530,"Abstract Using monoclonal antibodies we previously detected two forms of transformation-associated proteins, a 64-kDa protein and a 68-kDa protein, in temperature-sensitive 110-Moloney murine sarcoma virus-mutant-transformed rat kidney 6m2 cells. The identity and functions of the transformation-associated proteins were previously unknown. By molecular cloning techniques and immunoscreening, we have isolated two cDNA clones (34A and 79B3) that were found by Western blot analysis to code for a monoclonal anti-transformation-associated protein antibody-reactive polypeptide of approximately 58 kDa. Limited restriction enzyme mapping indicated 34A and 79B3 are two different cDNA clones. The nucleotide sequence of 34A cDNA was determined, and a search of GenBank revealed that it is identical to that of rat transin-2. The deduced amino acid sequence of 34A shares 71% sequence identity with rat transin and 41-76% identity with six human metalloproteinases. The limited restriction enzyme mapping and partial nucleotide sequencing data indicated that 79B3 may be the rat transin gene. When either 34A cDNA or 79B3 cDNA was used as a probe in Northern blot analysis, one mRNA band of approximately 1.9 kilobases was detected in 6m2 cells grown at the permissive temperature of 33 degrees C, at which the cells exhibited transformation properties, and a much lower level in 6m2 cells grown at the nonpermissive temperature of 39 degrees C, at which the cells reverted to normal phenotypes. These results suggest that at 39 degrees C, these two genes were not transcribed at the same level as at 33 degrees C. Zymogram and Western blot analysis of 6m2 cells further confirmed that the 64- and 68-kDa proteins have metalloproteinase activities and that the synthesis of metalloproteinases was also temperature-sensitive. Apparently, the two proteins we formerly designated transformation-associated proteins are members of the rat transin gene family. Therefore, within v-mos transformed 6m2 cells, the absence of transformation-associated protein (metalloproteinase) synthesis at the nonpermissive temperature was due to the absence of transcription of two rat transin genes."
https://openalex.org/W1600339639,"An IgG1 monoclonal antibody (mAb 54G8) which binds to both Bordetella pertussis chaperonin-60 (cpn60) and Escherichia coli cpn60 (GroEL) was produced. mAb 54G8 as well as Fab fragments prepared from this antibody were found to abolish the ability of chaperonin-10 (cpn10, GroES) to inhibit the ATPase activity of both B. pertussis cpn60 and E. coli cpn60. Electron microscopy was used to localize the binding site of the monoclonal antibody on the B. pertussis cpn60 molecule. In the absence of the antibody, the B. pertussis molecule exhibited the tetradecameric structure typical of cpn60. Both end views (showing 7-fold symmetry of the face of the molecule) and side views were evident. When mAb 54G8 was bound, B. pertussis cpn60 molecules appeared to be cross-linked so that they formed long chains. Only side views of the molecules were seen in these long chains. When B. pertussis cpn60 complexed with Fab fragments of mAb 54G8 was examined, chains were no longer observed. Instead, side views of B. pertussis cpn60 were often seen with Fab fragments extending from the ends of the molecule. These data indicate that mAb 54G8 appears to bind at or near the end of the B. pertussis cpn60 molecule and that binding of mAb 54G8 at this location affects the ability of cpn10 to productively interact with cpn60, most likely either by sterically blocking the binding of cpn10, by affecting the conformation of cpn60 in such a way that it no longer binds cpn10, or by inhibiting proper transduction of the effects of cpn10 binding."
