https://openalex.org/W2100075764,"125I-labeled and ferritin-labeled low density lipoprotein (LDL) were used as visual probes to study the surface distribution of LDL receptors and to examine the mechanism of the endocytosis of this lipoprotein in cultured human fibrobasts. Light microscopic autoradiograms of whole cells incubated with 125I-LDL at 4°C showed that LDL receptors were widely but unevenly distributed over the cell surface. With the electron microscope, we determined that 60–70% of the ferritin-labeled LDL that bound to cells at 4°C was localized over short coated segments of the plasma membrane that accounted for no more than 2% of the total surface area. To study the internalization process, cells were first allowed to bind ferritin-labeled LDL at 4°C and were then warmed to 37°C. Within 10 min, nearly all the surface-bound LDL-ferritin was incorporated into coated endocytic vesicles that were formed by the invagination and pinching-off of the coated membrane regions that contained the receptor-bound LDL. With increasing time at 37°C, these coated vesicles were observed sequentially to migrate through the cytoplasm (1 min), to lose their cytoplasmic coat (2 min), and to fuse with either primary or secondary lysosomes (6 min). The current data indicate that the coated regions of plasma membrane are specialized structures of rapid turnover that function to carry receptor-bound LDL, and perhaps other receptor-bound molecules, into the cell."
https://openalex.org/W1984145943,"Chemical modification with 2,3-butanedione in borate buffer indicates that nine of ten glycolytic enzymes studied contain arginyl residues at their active sites. Fructose-1,6-diphosphatase also has arginines at its binding site for the allosteric inhibitor, adenosine monophosphate. These and other data suggest that, as a general rule, enzymes acting on anionic substrates or cofactors will probably contain arginyl residues as components of their ligand binding sites. This could account in part for the relatively infrequent occurrence of arginine in proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1543273979,"Ripe Xenopus oocytes in first meiotic prophase when incubated with progesterone in vitro progress synchronously in 3 to 5 h without interphase to second meiotic metaphase where they remain until fertilization or activation. Using highly purified preparations of regulatory and catalytic subunits of adenosine 3':5'-monophosphate-dependent protein kinase from muscle, this progesterone-stimulated cell division sequence was found to be inhibited by microinjection of the catalytic subunit and induced directly in the absence of progesterone after microinjection of regulatory subunit. Dose-response curves revealed that half-maximal effects of regulatory and catalytic subunits occurred at an internal concentration of approximately 0.1 muM. These results indicate that the catalytic subunit is necessary and sufficient to block progesterone-stimulated meiotic cell division. Other experiments revealed that the catalytic subunit was inhibitory only during the first hour after progesterone exposure, suggesting that initial steps in meiotic cell division are affected. Control experiments demonstrate that the muscle cAMP-dependent protein kinase subunits may interact with the endogenous oocyte protein kinase. The results support a model in which meiotic cell division is regulated by a phosphoprotein subject to control by cAMP-dependent protein kinase."
https://openalex.org/W2013321725,"A cell-free system is described which assembles chromatin from purified DNA in 1 hr under physiological incubation conditions. It consists of a 145,000 x g (maximum) supernatant fraction from eggs of Xenopus laevis. It converts SV40 DNA to a nucleoprotein which co-sediments with naturally occurring SV40 chromatin and which can be cleaved by micrococcal nuclease to a highly ordered pattern of DNA fragments resembling those from digestion of liver chromatin. It inserts superhelical turns into relaxed, covalently closed DNA. The assembly process is not cooperative. Under limiting conditions, each DNA molecule becomes partially assembled. Assembly does not require replication of the DNA or protein synthesis, but occurs from a stored histone pool of at least 40 ng per egg. Under conditions of DNA excess, assembly becomes dependent upon the amount of exogenous histones added to the incubation. Apart from histones and a nicking-closing activity, chromatin assembly requires an additonal thermolabile factor which is present in the egg supernatant."
https://openalex.org/W1625449763,"The concentrations of the regulatory (R) and catalytic (C) subunits of adenosine 3':5'-monophosphate (cyclic AMP)-dependent protein kinase(s) were measured in extracts of skeletal muscle, heart, liver, kidney, and brain. These concentrations were also estimated for the particulate fraction from brain, the only tissue in which a major part of the total activity was not readily extracted in a soluble form. Values for R were determined by measuring the amount of cyclic [3H]amp bound to protein in these tissue fractions under specified conditions; it was assumed that 1 mol of cyclic AMP binds to 1 mol of R. Values for C were determined from measurements of the specific protein kinase activity of the fractions utilizing the turnover number of pure C in the calculations. Turnover numbers for C were found to be identical for this subunit obtained in the pure form from rabbit skeletal muscle, rabbit liver, and beef heart. The methods used for measuring C were evaluated by kinetic studies and through the use of the specific heatstable protein inhibitor of cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase(s). R and C were found to exist in a 1:1 molar ratio in all of the tissue fractions that were studied. the absolute concentrations of R and C ranged from 0.23 mumol/kg wet weight for liver to 0.78 mumol/kg wet weight for brain. For brain this value was based on the amount of each subunit in the particulate as well as the soluble fraction. For other tissues the values were based solely on the subunit content of the latter fraction. It was noted that the molar concentrations of R are close to those of cyclic AMP under basal conditions in the various tissues."
https://openalex.org/W2014734061,"Two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis is used to visualize the regulatory subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase from cultured S49 mouse lymphoma cells and to demonstrate its in vivo phosphorylation. Regulatory subunits from mutant cells with altered kinases exhibit at least two patterns of charge shifts consistent with substitutions of single amino acids. The direct demonstration of structural alteration of this protein provides strong evidence for structural gene mutation in this cultured cell system. While mutant and wild-type gene products co-exist in the mutant cells, there is apparently preferential expression and phosphorylation of mutant subunit in these heterozygotes."
https://openalex.org/W2167890969,"A new type of mutation that affects a discrete step in the process of adsorptive endocytosis has been identified in one of 22 strains of fibroblasts derived from subjects with the clinical phenotype of homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (FH). In this unique mutant strain (derived from subject J.D.), the cell surface receptor for plasma low density lipoprotein (LDL) was able to bind 125I-labeled LDL normally, but internalization of the receptor-bound lipoprotein failed to occur. Thus the defect in this strain differed from the defects found in the fibroblasts from the other 21 FH homozygote strains in which the binding of 125I-LDL to the receptor was either absent (receptor-negative) or markedly reduced (receptor-defective). The LDL receptor in the J.D. cells exhibited first, normal kinetics of high affinity binding at 4 degrees C and 37 degrees C; second, normal specificity (affinity for LDL more than 200 fold greater than for HDL); third, normal susceptibility to feed-back suppression by 25-hydroxycholesterol plus cholesterol; and fourth, a normal rate of turnover when the cells were treated with cycloheximide. Despite its normal ability to bind 125I-LDL, the LDL receptor in the J.D. cells failed to transport its LDL into the cell, and degradation of the lipoprotein in cellular lysosomes therefore did not occur. As a result, the lipoprotein did not suppress 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase activity; nor did it activate cholesteryl ester formation. A phenocopy of the internalization defect in the J.D. cells could be created by incubation of normal fibroblasts with N-ethyl maleimide, an agent that did not affect 125I-LDL binding to the receptor but blocked its subsequent internalization by the cell. The current data indicate that at least two gene products are necessary for the adsorptive endocytosis of LDL: one that is required for the binding of the lipoprotein, and one that promotes the internalization of the receptor-bound ligand."
https://openalex.org/W1552809292,"In the adrenal gland of the rat, the activity of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase, the rate-controlling enzyme of cholesterol synthesis, is shown to be regulated by cholesteerol carried in plasma lipoproteins. When plasma cholesterol levels were lowered 90% by administration of the drug 4-aminopyrazolopyrimidine, the cholesteryl ester content of the adrenal gland declined by more than 90% and this was associated with a 150- to 200-fold increase in the activity of adrenal 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase and a 30-fold increase in cholesterol synthesis from [14C]acetate. The subsequent intravenous infusion of cholesterol contained in either rat or human high density or low density lipoproteins restored the adrenal content of cholesteryl esters and reduced the activity of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase to basal levels. The depletion of adrenal cholesteryl esters and the enhancement in the activity of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase that occurred in the 4-aminopyrazolopyrimidine-treated rat required the action of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) since neither was observed when ACTH secretion was blocked by administration of dexamethasone. The current data indicate that the low rate of cholesterol synthesis normally observed in the rat adrenal gland is due to a suppression of the activity of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase that is mediated by plasma lipoproteins."
https://openalex.org/W1680964876,"There is broad species variation in the type of cAMP-dependent protein kinase isozyme present in supernatant fractions of heart homogenates as determined by DEAE-cellulose chromatography, Isozyme I, which elutes at less than 0.1 M NaCl, is predominant in mouse and rat hearts; while isozyme II, which elutes at greater than 0.1 M NaCl, is the predominant type in beef and guinea pig. Human and rabbit hearts contain about equal amounts of the two types. The type I heart kinases are more easily dissociated into free regulatory and catalytic subunits by incubation with histone than are the type II kinases, and the separated regulatory and catalytic subunits of isozyme II of rat heart reassociate more rapidly than the subunits of isozyme I under the conditions used. The data from several experiments using rat heart indicate that the basal activity ratio of the protein kinase in crude extracts (approximately 0.15) is due mainly to basal endogenous cAMP and that cAMP elevation accounts entirely for the epinephrine effect on the enzyme. Addition of epinephrine and 1-methyl-3-isobutylxanthine to the perfusate causes a rapid (1 min) increase in cAMP, active supernatant protein kinase, and active phosphorylase in perfused hearts of both rat (mainly isozyme I) and guinea pig (mainly isozyme II). The elevation percentage in cAMP is about the same in the two species, but the increase in active protein kinase is greater in rat heart. If hearts from either animal are perfused continually (10 min) with epinephrine (0.8 muM) and 1-methyl-3-isobutylxanthine (10 muM), the cAMP level, active protein kinase, and active phosphorylase remain elevated. Likewise, all parameters return rapidly to the basal levels when epinephrine and 1-methyl-3-isobutylxanthin are removed. Most of the epinephrine effect on the rat heart supernatant kinase is retained at 0 degrees if cAMP is removed by Sephadex G-25 chromatography, although this procedure completely reverses the epinephrine effect in the guinea pig heart. The epinephrine effect on the rabbit heart kinase (approximately equal amounts of isozymes I and II) is partially reversed by Sephadex G-25. These species differences can be accounted for by differences in association-dissociation behavior of the isozymes in vitro. The data suggest that epinephrine causes activation of both isozymes. The activity present in the particulate fraction comprises nearly half of the total cAMP-dependent protein kinase activity in homogenates of rabbit heart. Triton X-100 extracts of low speed particulate fractions from hearts of each species tested, including rat heart, contain predominantly or entirely the type II isozyme, suggesting differences in intracellular distribution of the isozymes. The binding of the protein kinase to the particulate fraction is apparently due to the properties of the regulatory subunit component. Differences in topographical distribution of the isozymes could provide for differences in either physiological regulation or substrate specificity."
https://openalex.org/W2058164535,"Histamine, acting on histamine type 2 receptors, increases intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate (AMP) and thus modulates the immunologic functions of lymphocytes. Lymphocyte cyclic AMP levels were used to follow the development of histamine receptors. The B lymphocytes have no functional histamine receptors. As T lymphocytes ""mature"" in immunologic function--from thymocytes to cortisone-resistant thymocytes to splenic T lymphocytes--their response to histamine increases. The response of these subpopulations of lymphocytes to isoproterenol is the inverse of the histamine response. It is suggested that the changing display of histamine receptors plays an important part in the control of immunologic responses."
https://openalex.org/W2068236353,"Intraventricular administration of the enkephalin analog, [D-Ala2]-metenkephalin, induces profound and long-lasting analgesia, as well as other opiate-like behavioral effects in the rat. This analgesia was highly dose dependent, of much greater magnitude, and about 30 times longer lasting than that produced by the naturally occurring peptide, methionine-enkephalin. The behavioral effects of the [D-Ala2] analog could be completely reversed by the opiate antagonist, naloxone, suggesting that these effects were mediated by opiate receptors. Systemic administration of naloxone alone resulted in a significant increase in pain sensitivity. These findings support the view that endogenous opiate systems may play an important role in modulating pain sensitivity."
https://openalex.org/W2058907910,"Infection of mice with the JHM strain of mouse hepatitis virus causes demyelination as a result of a cytolytic infection of oligodendroglia. In recovery, animals show remyelination, which could result either from surviving oligodendrocytes extending their territory or by generation of new oligodendroglia. Electron microscopic autoradiographic studies with 3H-labeled thymidine demonstrate that the cells associated with remyelination are newly generated oligodendroglia."
https://openalex.org/W2028901751,"The mustache bat, Pteronotus parnellii rubiginosus, emits orientation sounds containing a long constant-frequency (CF) component that is ideal for echo detection and Doppler shift measurement. About 30 percent of the primary auditory cortex of this bat is chiefly devoted to processing the second harmonic of the CF component in Doppler-shifted echoes. In this Doppler-shifted-CF processing area, single neurons recorded in any electrode penetration perpendicular to the cortical surface have nearly identical best frequencies and best amplitudes (or best pressure levels) at which the neurons show maximum excitation. The best frequency and best amplitude vary systematically with the location of the neurons in the cerebral cortex, so that there are tonotopic and ""amplitopic"" representation axes, which are radial and eccentric, respectively. In other words, the best-frequency and best-amplitude contours are eccentric and radial, respectively. The amplitude spectrum of a signal is thus represented in the coordinates of amplitude and frequency parallel to the cortical surface. This amplitude spectrum representation is disproportionate according to perceptual significance, so that a signal of 61.5 to 62.0 kilohertz and 30 to 50 decibels SPL (sound pressure level) is projected to a larger area than other signals. Just outside this Doppler-shifted-CF processing area, neurons are found which are specialized for responding to a particular information-bearing element or a particular combination of information-bearing elements in orientation sounds and echoes consisting of CF and frequency-modulated components."
https://openalex.org/W1991243649,"This paper describes the successful construction and propagation of a transducing animal virus. A segment of DNA approximately 2 kilobases (kb) in length was removed from the late region of the SV40 genome by sequential cleavages with Hpa II and Bam HI endonucleases (at 0.735 and 0.13, respectively, on the SV40 DNA map). A segment of about 1.5 kb of lambda phage containing ORI (the origin of lambda DNA replication), the two structural genes CII and cro, and four transcriptional promoters, was inserted into the late region of SV40 by the poly(dA:dT) joining procedure. The resulting hybrid DNAs were cloned and propagated as virions in CV-1 monkey kidney cells by mixed infections at 41 degrees C with tsA58, an early mutant of SV40. The location, size, and orientation of the inserted lambda DNA segment was verified by restriction endonuclease digestions and by heteroduplex analysis. Clones with each of the two possible orientations of the lambda DNA segment were isolated. CV-1 cells infected with lambda-SV40 hybrid virus contain little or no lambda-specific RNA or proteins, even though the hybrid virus replicates nearly as well as the helper virus."
https://openalex.org/W1877782890,"The nucleotide sequences at the 5′ termini of rabbit α and β globin mRNAs have been determined. Periodate oxidation of globin mRNA followed by reduction with 3H-sodium borohydride and subsequent analysis of the 3H-labeled mRNA reveals the presence of the “cap” structure m7G5′ppp-blocking the 5′ terminus. After periodate oxidation, β elimination, and phosphomonoesterase treatment to remove the m7G5′ppp-“cap,” the 5′ end of globin mRNA was labeled with 32P using γ-32P-ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase. The 5′-32P-labeled α and β globin mRNAs were then resolved from each other by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under denaturing conditions and sequenced separately. The 5′ terminal nucleotide sequences determined are: α—m7G5′ppp5′m6AmC(m)ACUUCUGG- β—m7G5′ppp5′m6AmC(m)ACUUGCUUUUGACACAA Besides the m7G “cap” structure, the two sequences are identical for the first six nucleotides and then diverge. No initiator codon is present within the first ten nucleotides from the 5′ end of the α globin mRNA, and the first nineteen nucleotides from the 5′ end of β globin mRNA."
https://openalex.org/W1525567009,"Vesicular stomatitis virus mRNAs with these four types of 5'-termini, (a) m7G5'ppp5'(m)Am, (b) ppp5'(m)Am, (c) m7G5'-ppp5' Am, and (d) G5'ppp5'A, were prepared and their translation and ribosome binding analyzed in wheat germ and reticulocyte cell-free protein synthesis systems. The relative efficiencies of translation of individual vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) mRNAs having type 2 termini ranged from 23 to 29% of the control (type 1) RNA in the reticulocyte system and 6 to 7% of control RNA in the wheat germ system. A similar difference between the two systems was seen in ribosome-binding experiments in which type 2 RNA formed an 80 S initiation complex with high efficiency (70% of control type 1 RNA) in the reticulocyte system, but with low efficiency (17% of control RNA) in the wheat germ system. Similar differences in the importance of m7G in translation in the two systems were seen when VSV mRNAs synthesized in vitro with type 3 and type 4 termini were analyzed. However, the analysis of type 4 RNA (which was synthesized in vitro in the presence of S-adenosylhomocysteine) was complicated by the presence of abnormally large poly(A) at its 3'-end. Another series of experiments showed that compounds such as 5'pm7G and m7G5'ppp5'Np are potent and specific inhibitors of translation of all types of VSV mRNAs in the wheat germ system (greater than 98% inhibition) but cause less than 20% inhibition of translation in the reticulocyte system. Taken together, all of the results indicate that a 5'-terminal m7G is far more important in translation of VSV mRNAs in the heterologous plant cell-free system than in the reticulocyte lysate system."
https://openalex.org/W2028099582,"Primary cultures of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HEC) developed extensive cytopathic changes and necrosis after high multiplicity infection with wild-type SV40 virus. Using the calcium co-precipitation technique, stable transformation was obtained with purified preparations of intact circular SV40 DNA and restriction endonuclease-derived linear DNA fragments containing the entire early gene region. Smooth muscle cells, isolated from the same blood vessels, showed neither cytopathic effects nor transformation after similar treatment with SV40 virus or DNA. The HEC cultures transformed by SV40 (SVHEC) expressed SV40-specific T (tumor) and Tr (transplantation) antigens, but not V (viral capsid) antigen. No evidence of infectious virus production was found upon co-cultivation with the CV-1 line of monkey kidney cells. Transformation resulted in markedly increased growth potential, loss of anchorage dependence and topoinhibition of growth, and a reduced serum requirement. Prolonged subcultivation was accompanied by chromosomal abnormalities and eventual ""crisis"". Transformed cells did not exhibit endothelial-specific organelles (Weibel-Palade bodies) or factor VIII antigen, but angiotensin-converting enzyme occasionally was detectable in SVHEC cultures. SV40-transformed human vascular endothelium, a nonfibroblast diploid cell type, may be useful in studies of oncogenesis and control of the differentiated state."
https://openalex.org/W2122673361,"A structural protein purified from the Rous sarcoma virus (RSV) can specifically bind in vitro to purified avian, but not mammalian, type C viral RNA. Following ultraviolet irradiation of viral particles under conditions which stabilize the polyploid 70S viral RNA, the same polypeptide can be directly purified from the RSV genome. Based on its electrophoretic mobility in polyacrylamide gels containing sodium dodecylsulfate, the RNA binding protein has been identified as the major phosphoprotein (p19) of avian type C viruses. Similar experiments show that the major phosphoproteins of mammalian type C viruses (p12 for murine viruses and p16 for endogenous primate viruses) are also the specific RNA binding proteins and, similarly, are found closely associated with the 70S RNA genomes in the intact viral particles."
https://openalex.org/W1998332925,"Cell surface levels of 3H-cAMP binding to Dictyostelium discoideum amebae are dramatically reduced when cells are preincubated with cAMP. This decrease in 3H-cAMP binding is shown to reflect a loss in the number of binding sites and not in any significant change in their affinity constant(s). cAMP-mediated loss of its binding sites requires the continued presence of the cyclic nucleotide and does not depend upon protein synthesis. Reapparition of sites, which occurs when cAMP is eliminated from the media, also does not depend upon protein synthesis. Experiments using metabolic inhibitors and heat-killed cells suggest that the loss of binding sites is a direct consequence of the formation of cAMP-binding protein complexes."

https://openalex.org/W1527049741,"Angiotensin-converting enzyme from rabbit serum was purified almost 60,000-fold to apparent homogeneity by a procedure exploiting its affinity for antibodies prepared against the enzyme from lung. The pure serum and pulmonary enzymes exhibited identical behavior during gel filtration, sucrose gradient centrifugation, and disc gel electrophoresis in the reduced, denatured state. Their catalytic properties with hippurylhistidylleucine, angiotensin I, and bradykinin as substrates were similar and their reactivity with antilung enzyme antibody was indistinguishable as examined by immunodiffusion, inhibition dose-response curves, and radioimmunoassay. Their content of fucose, mannose, galactose, and N-acetylglucosamine was also comparable; however, N-acetylneuraminic acid was much more abundant in the serum glycoprotein. This difference may reflect selective removal of sialic acid-deficient enzyme molecules from the circulation by the hepatic lectin which has been postulated to initiate the catabolic phase for plasma glycoproteins (Ashwell, G., and Morell, A.G. (1974) Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 41, 91-128)."
https://openalex.org/W2052106651,"A continuous line of buffalo rat hepatoma (HTC) cells has been successfully infected with mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) produced by the GR mammary tumor cell line. Uniform infection required initial exposure of the HTC cells to greater than 10(5) MMTV particles per cell. The resultant chronically infected cell population was found to have stably acquired 20-30 copies of MMTV DNA. The infected cells contain viral RNA and express viral antigens; however, very few MMTV particles are released into the culture medium. In spite of the biochemical evidence for infection, we have not detected any alterations in the morphology or growth properties of the infected HTC cells. As is the case in mammary tumor cells, the intracellular concentration of viral RNA is strongly stimulated (50-150 fold) by the synthetic glucorcorticoid, dexamethasone. Thus it appears that the mechanisms by which glucorticoids regulate MMTV gene expression in mouse cells are maintained when this virus infects nonmurine cells."

https://openalex.org/W1516425193,"The biochemical and biologic properties of a purified disulfide conjugate of diphtheria toxin fragment A and human placental lactogen (toxin A-hPL) have been studied by (a) assaying the ADP-ribosyltransferase activity of the intact conjugate, (b) assaying the binding of the intact conjugate to mammary gland plasma membrane lactogenic receptors, and (c) assaying the effect of the conjugate on the rate of protein synthesis in rabbit mammary gland explants maintained in organ culture. The toxin A-hPL conjugate retains one-third of the NAD+:EF-2 ADP-ribosyltransferase activity of toxin A, and 26% of the hPL-binding activity to lactogenic receptors. Binding activity was demonstrated by radioreceptor assay and by assaying toxin A activity bound to membranes which was competitively displaced by excess hPL. Since the toxin A-hPL conjugate retained activities of its separate subunits, it could be regarded as a structural analogue of nicked diphtheria toxin with replacement of the original membrane-binding chain by another binding chain that is specific for lactogenic receptor. However, the conjugate failed to inhibit protein synthesis in organ-cultured mammary gland explants, although these were sensitive to native diphtheria toxin and could bind hPL. It is concluded from these results that the toxin A-hPL conjugate does not act as a functional analogue of diphtheria toxin with altered receptor specificity, and that the hPL receptor cannot mediate the entry of toxin A or toxin A-hPL from membrane-bound conjugate into the cytosol site of action of toxin A."
https://openalex.org/W1677300243,"The administration of dexamethasone to rats markedly diminished the initial rate and maximal extent of substrate-dependent calcium uptake in subsequently isolated liver mitochondria, and enhanced the release of calcium. The apparent Km for calcium transport was not altered by dexamethasone treatment and it ranged from 50 to 80 muM when an EDTA/Ca buffer system was used in the presence of magnesium, and 20 muM when an NTA/Ca buffer system without magnesium was employed. In contrast, when ATP was employed as the energy source, there was no significant difference in initial rate, Km, or the extent of calcium accumulation between mitochondria from control and dexamethasone-treated animals. Although mitochondria from dexamethasone-treated animal showed 15% less cytochrome c oxidase activity/mg of protein, overall respiratory capacity and ATP production from ADP were the same as in control mitochondria. However, mitochondria from dexamethasone-treated animals translocated ATP from inside to outside faster than those from control animals. When the ATP in the medium was depleted by glucose and hexokinase, both types of mitochondria retained essentially all the preloaded calcium until total ATP reached a critical level (7 approximately 5 mumol of ATP/mg of protein). When ATP content fell below this critical level, mitochondria released all the calcium quickly. Dexamethasone treatment increased the susceptibility of mitochondria to the depletion of ATP. These data indicate that the dexamethasone-induced decrease in maximal calcium transport and in calcium retention carrier system per se, but o an altered ability of the mitochondria to regulate intramitochondrial ATP content."
https://openalex.org/W1603881488,"Adenosine 3':5'-monophosphate (cyclic AMP), a mediator of hormone action in a variety of tissues, has been measured in its free and bound forms in intact cardiac tissue. We have used a rapid high dilution technique which involves tissue homogenization, subcellular fractionation, and separation of bound from free cyclic AMP by Millopore filtration. The precision of this method is dependent upon minimization of binding and dissociation of cyclic AMP that occur during the preparation and handling of tissue homogenates. In each experiment, a tracer of cyclic [3H]AMP prebound to isolated cardiac binding protein was freed of unbound cyclic [3H]AMP by Sephadex gel filtration and added to the tissue just prior to homogenization in cold EDTA buffer. This tracer was therefore treated identically to the sample through all subsequent dilution, fractionation, and filtration procedures, and provided an acurate internal monitor for total cyclic AMP dissociation during the course of the free-bound determination. Each tissue sample was then individually corrected for dissociation. Rapid dilution to produce a 1:1000 homogenate was found to lower endogenous cyclic AMP levels sufficiently to make binding (or rebinding) during the procedure negligible (less than 5%). Spontaneously beating rat right atria (controls) contained 5.96 +/- 0.28 pmol of cyclic AMP/mg of protein (n = 19) of which 41 and 14% were bound to soluble and particulate proteins, respectively. The remaining cyclic AMP was free. Pretreatment of the tissue with 1 muM isoproterenol (30 s at 30 degrees) increased both the bound and free forms of cyclic AMP (n = 8). While free cyclic AMP increased 420% with the catecholamine, the bound forms increased 240% (soluble) and 60% (particulate). Similar results were obtained when atria (n = 6) were treated with the phosphodiesterase inhibitor, methylisobutylxanthine (0.5 mM, 10 min at 30 degrees). When both agents were used together, cyclic AMP bound to soluble proteins was elevated 4-fold over control while free cyclic AMP increased 27-fold (n = 7), indicating saturation of the soluble sites. It could be calculated that less than one-third of these sites are occupied in the unstimulated cell. These sites may represent the R subunit of cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase. The data suggest that half-maximal binding in vivo occurs at an intracellular free cyclic AMP concentration of about 1 muM."
https://openalex.org/W1518352470,"N1-S1/FdUrd Novikoff hepatoma cells, which lack thymidine kinase activity, are resistant to 5-fluorouracil (FUra) as well as 5-fluorodeoxyuridine (FdUrd), suggesting that the pathway, FUra leads to FdUrd leads to FdUMP, is utilized for the conversion of FUra to FdUMP. However, the inhibition of thymidylate synthetase activity, the presumed target of FdUMP, by 1 X 10(-4) M FUra in intact N1-S1 Novikoff hepatoma cells, which have significant levels of thymidine kinase activity, is completely eliminated by 5 X 10(-4) M hydroxyurea, which is a potent inhibitor of ribonucleotide reductase. These results imply that the formation of ribonucleotides and does not involve thymidine kinase. This apparent dichotomy can be explained by the fact that, in addition to the well known lack of thymidine kinase activity, [14C]FUra conversion to ribonucleotides is greatly depressed in the N1-S1/FdUrd cells. Hence, the formation of FdUMP from FUra in Novikoff hepatoma cells apparently proceeds primarily via the intermediate formation of ribonucleotides. The decreased conversion of FUra to ribonucleotides in N1-S1/FdUrd cells decreases not only the ability of the analog to inhibit DNA synthesis, but also its effect on RNA metabolism. FUra, at a concentration of 1 X 10(-5) M, inhibits rRNA maturation in N1-S1 cells, but not in N1-S1/FdUrd cells. Since N1-S1/FdUrd cells are completely resistant to 1 X 10(-5) M FUra, whereas N1-S1 cells are completely inhibited by 1 X 10(-5) M FUra, even in the presence of 1 X 10(-4) M thymidine, the effects of FUra on RNA metabolism appear to contribute significantly to the cytotoxicity of the analog at higher drug concentrations."
https://openalex.org/W1564955095,"A newly discovered cyclic AMP-independent protein kinase, which catalyzes the total conversion of glycogen synthase from the I- to the D-form, has been isolated from rabbit skeletal muscle. This enzyme, designated glycogen synthase kinase, is separable from cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase by column chromatography on phosphocellulose. Synthase kinase and cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase are distinct in their specificity for protein substrates, the effects of cyclic AMP and the inhibitor of cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase on their activities, and the extent to which they phosphorylate I-form glycogen synthase. The phosphorylation of I-form enzyme by synthase kinase results in the incorporation of 4 mol of phosphate/85,000 subunit; however only two of the phosphate sites seem predominantly to determine glucose-6-P dependence. The resulting multiply phosphorylated enzyme, which is highly dependent on glucose-6 P for activity, has a phosphate content comparable to the D-form enzyme isolated from rabbit muscle."
https://openalex.org/W1574217352,"For a better definition of the role of human serum apolipoprotein A-I (apo A-I) in high density lipoprotein structure, a systematic investigation was carried out on factors influencing the in vitro association of this apoprotein with lipids obtained from the parent high density lipoprotein (HDL); these lipids include phospholipids, free cholesterol, cholesteryl esters, and triglycerides. Following equilibration, mixtures of apo A-I and lipids in varying stoichiometric amounts were fractionated by sequential flotation, CsCl density gradient ultracentrifugation, or gel-permeation chromatography, and the isolated complexes were characterized by physicochemical means. As defined by operational criteria (flotation at density 1,063 to 1.21 g/ml), only two types of HDL complexes were reassembled; one, reconstituted HDLS, small with a radius of 31 A, and the other, reconstituted HDLL, large with a radius of 39 A. The two types incorporated all of the lipid constituents of native HDL and contained 2 and 3 mol of apo A-I, respectively. A maximal yield of reconstituted HDL (R-HDL) was observed at an initial protein concentration of 0.1 muM, where apo A-I is predominantly monomeric. At increasing protein concentrations, the amount of apo A-I recovered in R-HDL was found to be proportional to the initial concentration of monomer and dimer in solution. The composition and yield of the complexes were independent of ionic strength and pH within the ranges studied. Both simple incubation and cosonication of apo A-I with HDL phospholipids produced complexes of identical composition, although the yeild of complexes was higher with co-sonication. When the comparison of the same methods was extended to mixtures of apo A-I and whole HDL lipids, the results confirmed previous observations that co-sonication is essential for the incorporation of the neutral lipid into the R-HDL complexes. The results indicate that (a) in vitro complexation of apo A-I with lipids is under kinetic control; (b) apo A-I can generate a lipid-protein complex with properties similar to those of the parent lipoprotein; (c) the process requires well defined experimental conditions and, most importantly, the presence in solution of monomers and dimers of apo A-I; (d) the number of apo A-I molecules incorporated into R-HDL determines the size and structure of the reassembled particle. All of these observations strongly support the essential role of apo A-I in the structure of human HDL."
https://openalex.org/W1986216413,"The ability of various murine leukemia viruses (MuLVs) to replicate in mouse cells exhibiting Fv-1 restriction was analyzed by quantitative dose-response assays. In particular, the effect of infection with N, B, or NB tropic MuLVs on Fv-1b restriction in Balb/3T3 cells was measured with an infection center technique in which pseudotypes of murine sarcoma virus (MSV), which have been shown to exhibit Fv-1 dependence of expression, were used to quantitate the degree of restriction. The resulting dose-response curves indicate that productive infection of a single Balb/3T3 cell with N tropic MSV requires co-infection with two MuLV particles. These two MuLV particles are functionally distinguishable. One of them must be N tropic and must be added less than 18 hr after infection with N tropic MSV. The second MuLV particle, on the other hand, need not be N tropic and may be added at any time. Balb/3T3 cultures infected with sufficient N tropic MuLV become fully permissive to transformation by N tropic MSV and to productive infection by N tropic MuLV. This effect, termed ""abrogation"" of Fv-1 restriction, results from infection of a Balb/3T3 cell with a single N tropic MuLV particle, but apparently occurs without viral replication. It seems probable that a requirement for abrogation of Fv-1b restriction by a single infectious particle of N tropic MuLV, which does not itself replicate, is responsible for the two-hit dose-response relationship observed in infectivity titrations of N tropic MuLV in Balb/3T3 cells. The requirements that N tropic MuLV be added within a specified time period with regard to N tropic MSV in order for abrogation to occur suggests that in the absence of N tropic MuLV, the cellular Fv-1b restriction mechanism inactivates N tropic MSV by 9 hr after infection."

Fractionation of DNA by the procedure of Hirt (1967) as well as by sedimentation through alkaline sucrose suggests that about two thirds of the viral DNA is associated with high molecular weight cell DNA. The remainder of the viral DNA is unintegrated and is present primarily as linear or open circular duplexes consisting of a genome-length strand complementary to the viral RNA (""minus"" strand) and ""plus"" strands of subgenomic length. Approximately 20% of the unintegrated MMTV DNA is present as double-stranded, covently closed circles (form I) with a molecular weight of 6 X 10(6) daltons. Form I viral DNA is found primarily in the nucleus, whereas the open forms are both nuclear and cytoplasmic."
https://openalex.org/W1586791994,"In order to study the mechanism of entry of plant seed and bacterial toxins into mammalian cells, methods have been developed to synthesize artificial protein hybrid conjugates containing a moiety which binds to a cell membrane receptor and an active fragment of a toxin protein. Utilizing methyl-5-bromovalerimidate, a disulfide cross-linked conjugate of human placental lactogen (hPL) and diphtheria toxin fragment A (toxin A) was synthesized. The reagent was prepared from 5-bromovaleryl nitrile by Pinner synthesis and then used to amidinate hPL. The bromo group thus introduced was converted to S-sulfonate by nucleophilic displacement with 1 M aqueous sodium thiosulfate at room temperature overnight. The S-sulfonated hPL reacted readily with the-SH gorup of reduced toxin A to form a 1 mol/mol of disulfide conjugate in high yield. Thus when reduced toxin A was incubated with a 4-fold excess of the hPL S-sulfonate at 4 degrees and pH 6.5 for 120 h, a conjugate yield of 50% relative to the toxin A input was obtained. Homopolymer formation was negligible and the product was purified by gel filtration on Sephadex G-150. Purity of the conjugate estimated by quantitative analysis of sodium dodecyl sulfate gels was 90%. The toxin A-hPL conjugate retained the activities of both toxin A and hPL, as reported in the accompanying paper. This method of preparing protein hybrid conjugates appeared to have advantages over previous methods utilizing bifunctional reagents with respect to both yield and freedom from homopolymer formation."

Conditions under which the redundant portions of the ferrous complex can be removed by limited trypsin digestion have been devised. The complementing fragments have been isolated from the derived complexes and four apofragments and one heme fragment have been identified in the amino acid sequence of cytochrome c. They are (39-104), (40-104), (54-104), (56-104), and (1-53)H. The formation of an ordered ferric complex composed of one heme fragment and one apofragment for the cases (1-53)H (39-104), (1-53)H-(40-104), (1-53)H-(54-104), and (1-53)H-(56-104) has been demonstrated by the quenching of the tryptophan 59 fluorescence and the regain of biological activity in a cytochrome b2 assay. The apparent dissociation constant has been estimated as less than 3 X 10(-7) M in all the aforementioned cases. Thus, the region (between residues 38 and 57) of the amino acid sequence permissible for cleavage without disruption of the ordered structure indicated by the present in vitro experiments corresponds to that (between residues 38 and 57) evolutionally deleted in the three-dimensional structure of Pseudomonas aeruginosa cytochrome c551 discovered by Dickerson et al.

https://openalex.org/W1581328433,"The mechanism of action of serum lipoproteins and 25-hydroxycholesterol on 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase activity in hepatoma tissue culture (HTC) cells was investigated using antiserum against purified rat liver HMG-CoA reductase (Heller, R. A., and Shrewsbury, M. A. (1976)J. Biol. Chem. 251, 3815-3822). This antiserum cross-reacted with solubilized and membrane-bound HMG-CoA reductase from HTC cells. The enzymes from rat liver and HTC cells appeared antigenically identical. The increase in HMG-CoA reductase activity of HTC cells grown in medium which lacked serum lipoproteins was shown to be due to an increase in immunoprecipitable enzyme. In contrast, the 25-hydroxycholesterol suppression of reductase activity leads to a reduction in the antigenicity of the enzyme rather than a decrease in its number of molecules."
https://openalex.org/W2091947629,"Cell-substrate adherence in cultures of chicken embryo fibroblasts was examined by determining the number of cells which could be detached from the culture dish by a stream of medium. Transformed cells were significantly less adherent than their normal counterparts. In cultures infected with a mutant of Rous sarcoma virus which is temperature-conditional for transformation, adherence changed promptly following a temperature shift. This change did not require progression through the cell cycle. The transformation-specific decrease in adherence required new protein synthesis, but the restoration of adherence which occurred following a shift to the restrictive temperature could occur in the absence of new protein synthesis. Inhibitor experiments suggested the importance of microfilaments and perhaps microtubules in the changes in detachability. In addition, there was a positive correlation between levels of surface LETS protein and cell substrate adherence following a temperature shift, although it seems probable that the bulk of the surface LETS is neither necessary nor sufficient for maintenance of normal cell substrate adherence."
https://openalex.org/W1983862447,"Changes in plasminogen activator activity have been examined as a clonal line of mouse embryonal carcinoma cells aggregate and differentiate to form cystic embryoid bodies in vitro. Within the first 10 days of study, the pluripotent embryonal carcinoma cells aggregate; a layer of endodermal cells appears on the outside of the aggregate forming an embryoid body; a basement membrane forms between the outer layer of endodermal cells and the internal cells; a cyst forms within the embryoid body; and the internal cells assume a columnar appearance along the inner portion of the basement membrane. After the formation of the endodermal layer, there is a rise in intracellular plasminogen activator activity. This rise continues for up to 25 days in culture, providing that the three-dimensional integrity of the embryoid bodies is maintained by culturing them on bacterial petri dishes. Selective removal of the outer endodermal layer of cells reduces the plasminogen activatory activity of the resulting embryoid body cores. Intracellular and secreted plasminogen activator activity of simple embryoid bodies composed of only two cell types can be increased by culturing the embryoid bodies in dbcAMP, theophylline, or cholera toxin. These results suggest that the embryoid body endodermal cells are the source of a cAMP-inducible plasminogen activator activity."
https://openalex.org/W1589072566,"The reversible deactivation of chicken adipose tissue hormone-sensitive lipase alpha(previously activated with Mg2+ ATP and adenosine 3':5'-monophosphate) required Mg2+ and was inhibited by phosphate. These results are consistent with the assumption that deactivation of the protein kinase-activated enzyme is catalyzed by a lipase phosphatase. Cholesterol ester is catalyzed by a lipase phosphatase. Cholesterol ester hydrolase similarly was activated and reversibly deactivated. The activity of endogenous lipase phosphatase in pH 5.2 precipitate fractions was reduced, and in some cases eliminated, by incubation at 50 degrees for 20 min in buffer containing 20% glycerol. Heating at 50 degrees greatly increased the apparent percentage activation of triglyceride and cholesterol ester hydrolases but this was due to a selective decrease in basal (nonactivated) hydrolase activities. Essentially all endogenous lipase phosphatase could be removed by treatment of the pH 5.2 precipitate fraction with ATP-Sepharose affinity gel. The addition of a partially purified preparation of rat liver phosphorylase phosphatase deactivated triglyceride and cholesterol ester hydrolases. The deactivation process was concentration, 5 mM) and was inhibited by 5 mM phosphate and by phosphorylase alpha. Reversible deactivation of hormone-sensitive lipase alpha was also observed with crude prepa- and by phosphorylase alpha. Reversible deactivation of hormone-sensitive lipas alpha was also observed with crude preparations of phosphoprotein phosphatases from rat and turkey hearts, and from rat epididymal fat pads. Thus, hormone-sensitive lipase is deactivated by a variety of phosphoprotein phosphatases from different tissues and different species, implying a low degree of specificity for the deactivating system."

At low substrate concentrations (0.5 muM) cGMP was hydrolyzed more rapidly than cAMP and hydrolysis of 0.5 muM cAMP was stimulated by 1 muM cGMP. E III had a low Km for cAMP. Incubation of cells with 1 muM dexamethasone for 72 h decreased the activity of E I and E II. In cells incubated with N6,O2'-dibutyryl cAMP plus 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine for 14 h the activity of E III was increased approximately 100%. Similar activities of calcium-dependent, heat stable phosphodiesterase activator were recovered from supernatants from all cells.

https://openalex.org/W1521458336,"The addition of norepinephrine to brown fat in vitro produced a dose-dependent increase in the protein kinase activity ratio (the ratio of activity assayed without cAMP to that assayed with cAMP) in extracts subsequently prepared in the presence of 0.5 M NaCl. The ratio was slightly increased by insulin. The effects of norepinephrine were potentiated by theophylline and reduced by propranolol. There was a significant linear regression between protein kinase activity ratio and the rate of glycerol release for ratios between 0.32 and 0.52. Higher activity ratios were associated with a slight but nonsignificant increase in glycerol release. The relationship between the protein kinase activity ratio and the concentration of cAMP in brown fat could be expressed by simple saturation kinetics. There was a significant linear regression between the reciprocal of the concentration of cAMP in the tissue and the reciprocal of the activity ratio over the whole range of observed values. Exposure of 1-month-old rats to cold increased the protein kinase activity ratio in their brown fat. This confirms that activation of protein kinase is involved in the physiological response of a tissue to a specific environmental stimulus. As the rat became fully adapted to the cold, the activity ratio declined. The protein kinase activity ratio in brown fat was low in late fetuses but greatly increased immediately after birth and remained high for the next 2 weeks. During this period the ratio was not further increased by the injection of norepinephrine but was reduced after chemical sympathectomy. The activity ratio in brown fat fell during the 3rd and 4th weeks after birth. At this time injection of norepinephrine increased the ratio whereas chemical sympathectomy had little effect. These observations confirm that the stimulation of the tissue by the sympathetic nerves results in an activation of protein kinase and reflect the reduced requirement for heat production in brown fat as the animals grow."

(1975) Eur. J. Biochem. 51, 33-42). The EPR parameters for the beta-nitrosylhemes of Hb Kansas are: gxx=2.094 gyy=2.031, gzz=2.00, Azetazeta=11 G, Azetazeta=32.5 G, Aetaeta=12.5 G; the Fe-N-O bond angle is about 105 degrees. The paramters for the alpha-nitrosyl hemes are: gxx=2.058, gyy=2.021, gzz=1.977, Azetazeta=24.5 G, Azetazeta less than or equal to 5G, Aetaeta=23 G; the Fe-N-O bond angle is about 167 degrees. Hyperfine splittings of 7 to 8 gauss with 14Nepsilon atom of His(F8) were observed for the beta-nitrosylhemes; none was resolved for the alpha-nitrosylhemes. The results were interpreted to mean that the tension on the iron of the beta subunits is not large in the unliganded state and this tension was not greatly increased by the binding of nitric oxide in the strongly bent configuration. The tension at the iron in the deoxyhemoglobin is dominant at the alpha subunits. Binding of nitric oxide in this case causing either the breaking or great weakening of the Fe-His(F8) bond. The nitrosyl is in a nearly linear configuration. The unpaired electron densities at the nitrogen atom of the bound nitric oxide is about 63% for the beta-nitrosylheme and 37% for the alpha-nitrosylhemes."

https://openalex.org/W146478101,"Using the ligands [125I]iodohydroxybenzylpindolol and [3H]prostaglandin E1 ([3H]PGE1), we have studied the relationship of receptors for beta-adrenergic agents and for PGE1 to adenylate cyclase in membranes of parental, hybrid, and variant mammalian cell lines. Fusion of parental clones responsive to beta-adrenergic agonists (beta+) with unresponsive clones (beta-) produced hybrid clones with a greatly diminished beta-adrenergic response; beta+ X beta leads to beta-. Binding studies with [125I]iodohydroxybenzylpindolol showed a decreased concentration of beta receptors in six such hybrid clones. Thus, paucity of beta-adrenergic receptors is probably a sufficient, albeit not necessarily complete, explanation for the decreased beta-adrenergic responsiveness of the hybrid clones. When a clone with beta receptor but without apparent adenylate cyclase activity (HC-1) was hybridized with a beta- clone that has adenylate cyclase (B82), a responsive hybrid clone was obtained. In nine cell hybrids produced by the fusion of clones responsive (PGE1+) and unresponsive (PGE1-) to PGE1, high affinity binding sites for [3H]PGE1 were expressed in the same manner as was PGE1-sensitive adenylate cyclase: PGE1+ X PGE1 leads to PGE1+. The chemical specificities and affinities of the parental receptors and responsive adenylate cyclases were faithfully reproduced in the hybrid clones. Activation by PGE1 was proportional to the occupation of the high affinity receptors. In a wild type lymphoma clone (24.3.2), the concentration dependences for binding of [3H]PGE1 and for activation of adenyalte cyclase by PGE1 were identical. In a variant lymphoma clone (94.15.1) lacking adenylate cyclase activity, no high affinity receptors for PGE1 were detected, whereas beta-adrenergic receptors have been demonstrated in this variant clone (Insel, P.A., Maguire, M.E., Gilman, A.G., Coffino, P., Bourne, H., and Melmon, K. (1976) Mol. Pharmacol. 12, 1062-1069). Hybrid cells formed by the fusion of 94.15.1 with cell line RAG (PGE1-) responded to PGE1. Clone 94.15.1 may have receptors for PGE1 of reduced affinity or in low concentration. Alternatively, RAG and 94.15.1 may have complementary genetic defects such that the RAG X 94.15.1 hybrid cells express a hormonally responsive receptor-adenylate cyclase system."
https://openalex.org/W1487017231,"The results presented in this report suggest that human oxyhemoglobin can directly form methemoglobin and superoxide anion when flashed with low intensity (38 joules) white light. The effect only occurred in quartz but not glass (cut off lambda approximately equal to 300 nm) cuvettes. The formation of O2 was established by observing the reduction of oxidized cytochrome c concomitant with MetHb formation at pH 9, and by showing that superoxide dismultase and catalse inhibit cytochrome c reduction at that pH. The inhibition of cytochrome c reduction by catalase led us to explore the possibility that H2O2 might reduce oxidized cytochrome c at pH 9. We show that H2O2 does reduce oxidized cytochrome c at that pH but not at pH 7. Furthermore, catalase but not superoxide dismutase, almost completely inhibited this reduction process. These experiments serve to confirm our interpretation of the effect of catalase on the reduction of oxidized cytochrome c in the photolytic experiments, thus establishing that H2O2 was also formed. In addition, we were able to identify the production of O2 and H2O2 due to the photolysis of water in agreement with the results of McCord and Fridovich ((1973) Photochem. Photobiol. 17, 115-121). Production of O2 from this source was considerably less than that observed when HbO2 was present. Addition of MetHb to aerated solutions of oxidized cytochrome c did not cause additional reduction, unlike addition of HbO2. The production of MetHb was found to have at least two components. One component was the primary photolytic process, and the second was a strongly pH-dependent reattack of HbO2 by O2. Addition of superoxide dismutase inhibited this second component, but did not significantly effect the primary photolytic process."
https://openalex.org/W1982789071,"An earlier report (Subramanian, Dhar, and Weissman, 1977c) presented the nucleotide sequence of Eco RII-G fragment of SV40 DNA, which contains the origin of DNA replication. The nucleotide sequence of Eco RII-N fragment located next to Eco RII-G on the physical map of SV40 DNA is presented in this report. Eco RII-N is found to be a tandem duplication of the last 55 nucleotides of Eco RII-G. This tandem repeat is immediately preceded by two other reiterated sequences occurring within Eco RII-G, one of them being a tandem repeat of 21 nucleotides and the other a nontandem repeat of 10 nucleotides. These repetitive sequences occur in close proximity to the origin of DNA replication which is known to contain other specialized sequences such as a few palindromes (one of which is 27 long and possesses a perfect 2-fold axis of symmetry), one ""true"" palindrome, and a long A/T-rich cluster. The repeats (and the replication origin) occur within an untranslated region of SV40 DNA flanked by (the few) structural genes coding for the ""late"" proteins on the one side and that (those) coding for the ""early"" protein(s) on the other side. The reiterated sequences are comparable in some respects to repetitive sequences occurring in eucaryotic DNAs. Possible biological functions of the repeats are discussed."

This inactivation is relatively specific since various pyridoxal-5'-P analogs cause no inactivation. This effect is reversible but can be made irreversible by reduction with sodium borohydride; the reduced pyridoxal-5'-P adduct exhibits a new absorbance maximum at 325 nm and a fluorescence emission at 392 nm when excited at 325 nm. The evidence presented suggests the formation of a Schiff base between pyridoxal-5'-P and a nucleophilic residue of AMV DNA polymerase. The presence of a deoxynucleoside 5'-triphosphate (dTTP) protected the enzyme from inactivation. Reduction of the pyridoxal-5'-P enzyme complex in the presence or absence of a deoxynucleoside 5'-triphosphate showed that the alpha subunit possesses five reactive amino groups, one of which is essential for catalytic activity; the beta subunit has three reactive amino groups which are not involved in the deoxynucleoside binding site."

Crystal field analysis yielded values of 2.25 and 3.31, respectively, for the rhombic distortion, V/lambda, and the tetragonal distortion, delta/lambda. The spin orbit coupling constant is lambda. At pH 4.0 the values of V/lambda and delta/lambda for carp azidomethemoglobin became 1.95 and 4.76, respectively, whereas those for the human hemoglobin are virtually unchanged. The results are interpreted to mean an increase of out-ofplane displacement of the iron atom and stabilization of the T form of carp azidomethemoglobin by high proton concentration. At pH 6.0 and lower, the EPR spectra of carp azidomethemoglobin showed the presence of about 1.5% of high spin species, the amount is not affected by excess of either inositol hexaphosphate or sodium azide.
