https://openalex.org/W3140446408,"The highly transmissible B.1.1.7 variant of SARS-CoV-2, first identified in the United Kingdom, has gained a foothold across the world. Using S gene target failure (SGTF) and SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequencing, we investigated the prevalence and dynamics of this variant in the United States (US), tracking it back to its early emergence. We found that, while the fraction of B.1.1.7 varied by state, the variant increased at a logistic rate with a roughly weekly doubling rate and an increased transmission of 40%–50%. We revealed several independent introductions of B.1.1.7 into the US as early as late November 2020, with community transmission spreading it to most states within months. We show that the US is on a similar trajectory as other countries where B.1.1.7 became dominant, requiring immediate and decisive action to minimize COVID-19 morbidity and mortality."
https://openalex.org/W3155313092,"Despite the progress in medical care, combined population-wide interventions (such as physical distancing, testing and contact tracing) are still crucial to manage the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, aggravated by the emergence of new highly transmissible variants. We combine the compartmental SIDARTHE model, predicting the course of COVID-19 infections, with a new data-based model that projects new cases onto casualties and healthcare system costs. Based on the Italian case study, we outline several scenarios: mass vaccination campaigns with different paces, different transmission rates due to new variants, and different enforced countermeasures, including the alternation of opening and closure phases. Our results demonstrate that non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) have a higher impact on the epidemic evolution than vaccination, which advocates for the need to keep containment measures in place throughout the vaccination campaign. We also show that, if intermittent open-close strategies are adopted, deaths and healthcare system costs can be drastically reduced, without any aggravation of socioeconomic losses, as long as one has the foresight to start with a closing phase rather than an opening one."

However, it is unknown whether striatal targets receive tailored dopamine dynamics based on regional functional specialization. Here, we report wave-like spatiotemporal activity patterns in dopamine axons and release across the dorsal striatum. These waves switch between activational motifs and organize dopamine transients into localized clusters within functionally related striatal subregions. Notably, wave trajectories were tailored to task demands, propagating from dorsomedial to dorsolateral striatum when rewards are contingent on animal behavior and in the opponent direction when rewards are independent of behavioral responses. We propose a computational architecture in which striatal dopamine waves are sculpted by inference about agency and provide a mechanism to direct credit assignment to specialized striatal subregions. Supporting model predictions, dorsomedial dopamine activity during reward-pursuit signaled the extent of instrumental control and interacted with reward waves to predict future behavioral adjustments."
https://openalex.org/W3155911001,"Long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) genes have well-established and important impacts on molecular and cellular functions. However, among the thousands of lncRNA genes, it is still a major challenge to identify the subset with disease or trait relevance. To systematically characterize these lncRNA genes, we used Genotype Tissue Expression (GTEx) project v8 genetic and multi-tissue transcriptomic data to profile the expression, genetic regulation, cellular contexts, and trait associations of 14,100 lncRNA genes across 49 tissues for 101 distinct complex genetic traits. Using these approaches, we identified 1,432 lncRNA gene-trait associations, 800 of which were not explained by stronger effects of neighboring protein-coding genes. This included associations between lncRNA quantitative trait loci and inflammatory bowel disease, type 1 and type 2 diabetes, and coronary artery disease, as well as rare variant associations to body mass index."
https://openalex.org/W2976146569,"Understanding population health disparities is an essential component of equitable precision health efforts. Epidemiology research often relies on definitions of race and ethnicity, but these population labels may not adequately capture disease burdens and environmental factors impacting specific sub-populations. Here, we propose a framework for repurposing data from electronic health records (EHRs) in concert with genomic data to explore the demographic ties that can impact disease burdens. Using data from a diverse biobank in New York City, we identified 17 communities sharing recent genetic ancestry. We observed 1,177 health outcomes that were statistically associated with a specific group and demonstrated significant differences in the segregation of genetic variants contributing to Mendelian diseases. We also demonstrated that fine-scale population structure can impact the prediction of complex disease risk within groups. This work reinforces the utility of linking genomic data to EHRs and provides a framework toward fine-scale monitoring of population health."
https://openalex.org/W3155071872,"Introduction The COVID-19 pandemic has compounded the global crisis of stress and burnout among healthcare workers. But few studies have empirically examined the factors driving these outcomes in Africa. Our study examined associations between perceived preparedness to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic and healthcare worker stress and burnout and identified potential mediating factors among healthcare workers in Ghana. Methods Healthcare workers in Ghana completed a cross-sectional self-administered online survey from April to May 2020; 414 and 409 completed stress and burnout questions, respectively. Perceived preparedness, stress, and burnout were measured using validated psychosocial scales. We assessed associations using linear regressions with robust standard errors. Results The average score for preparedness was 24 (SD = 8.8), 16.3 (SD = 5.9) for stress, and 37.4 (SD = 15.5) for burnout. In multivariate analysis, healthcare workers who felt somewhat prepared and prepared had lower stress (β = -1.89, 95% CI: -3.49 to -0.30 and β = -2.66, 95% CI: -4.48 to -0.84) and burnout (β = -7.74, 95% CI: -11.8 to -3.64 and β = -9.25, 95% CI: -14.1 to –4.41) scores than those who did not feel prepared. Appreciation from management and family support were associated with lower stress and burnout, while fear of infection was associated with higher stress and burnout. Fear of infection partially mediated the relationship between perceived preparedness and stress/burnout, accounting for about 16 to 17% of the effect. Conclusions Low perceived preparedness to respond to COVID-19 increases stress and burnout, and this is partly through fear of infection. Interventions, incentives, and health systemic changes to increase healthcare workers’ morale and capacity to respond to the pandemic are needed."
https://openalex.org/W3156511332,"Background Since the declaration of COVID-19 as a pandemic, all scientific medical activities were shifted to an online format, in the form of webinars, to maintain continuing medical education (CME). We aimed to assess physicians’ attitude among different medical specialties towards this sudden and unexpected shift of traditional face-to-face meetings into webinars, and to suggest future recommendations. Methods We conducted a cross-sectional, internet-based survey study using a 25-item questionnaire, from November 1 and November 15, 2020. The survey was created and distributed to physicians from different medical and surgical specialties and from different countries via several social media platforms, using a snowball technique. Results A total of 326 physicians responded; 165 (50.6%) were females, mean age of responders was 38.7 ± 7.5 years. The majority of responses (93.2%) came from Arab countries. Of them, 195 (59.8%) reported attending more webinars compared to the same period last year, with average of 3 per month. As regard to the general impression; 244 (74.8%) were “strongly satisfied” or “satisfied”, with the most satisfaction for “training courses: by 268 (82.2%), and “International conferences” by 218 (66.9%). However, 246 respondents (75.5%) felt overwhelmed with the number and frequency of webinars during the pandemic, 171 (52.5%) reported attending less than 25% of webinars they are invited to, 205 (62.8%) disagreed that webinars can replace in-person meetings after the pandemic, and 239 (73.3%) agreed that online meetings need proper regulations. Conclusions Webinars comprised a major avenue for education during COVID-19 pandemic, with initial general satisfaction among physicians. However, this paradigm shift was sudden and lacked proper regulations. Despite initial satisfaction, the majority of physicians felt overwhelmed with the number and frequency of webinars. Physicians’ satisfaction is crucial in planning future educational activities, and considering that this current crisis will most likely have long lasting effects, webinars should be viewed as complementing traditional in-person methods, rather than replacement. In this study, we are suggesting recommendations to help future regulation of this change."
https://openalex.org/W3156603019,"Background Given the economic and social divide that exists in South Africa, it is critical to manage the health response of its residents to the Covid-19 pandemic within the different socio-economic contexts that define the lived realities of individuals. Objective The objective of this study is to analyse the Covid-19 preventive behaviour and the socio-economic drivers behind the health-response behaviour. Data The study employs data from waves 1 and 2 of South Africa’s nationally representative National Income Dynamics Study (NIDS)—Coronavirus Rapid Mobile Survey (CRAM). The nationally representative panel data has a sample of 7073 individuals in Wave 1 and 5676 individuals in Wave 2. Methods The study uses bivariate statistics, concentration indices and multivariate estimation techniques, ranging from a probit, control-function approach, special-regressor method and seemingly unrelated regression to account for endogeneity while identifying the drivers of the response behaviour. Findings The findings indicate enhanced behavioural responsiveness to Covid-19. Preventive behaviour is evolving over time; the use of face mask has overtaken handwashing as the most utilised preventive measure. Other measures, like social distancing, avoiding close contact, avoiding big groups and staying at home, have declined between the two periods of the study. There is increased risk perception with significant concentration among the higher income groups, the educated and older respondents. Our findings validate the health-belief model, with perceived risk, self-efficacy, perceived awareness and barriers to preventive strategy adoption identified as significant drivers of health-response behaviour. Measures such as social distancing, avoiding close contact, and the use of sanitisers are practised more by the rich and educated, but not by the low-income respondents. Conclusion The respondents from lower socio-economic backgrounds are associated with optimism bias and face barriers to the adoption of preventive strategies. This requires targeted policy attention in order to make response behaviour effective."
https://openalex.org/W3154972878,"Naturalistic escape requires versatile context-specific flight with rapid evaluation of local geometry to identify and use efficient escape routes. It is unknown how spatial navigation and escape circuits are recruited to produce context-specific flight. Using mice, we show that activity in cholecystokinin-expressing hypothalamic dorsal premammillary nucleus (PMd-cck) cells is sufficient and necessary for context-specific escape that adapts to each environment's layout. In contrast, numerous other nuclei implicated in flight only induced stereotyped panic-related escape. We reasoned the dorsal premammillary nucleus (PMd) can induce context-specific escape because it projects to escape and spatial navigation nuclei. Indeed, activity in PMd-cck projections to thalamic spatial navigation circuits is necessary for context-specific escape induced by moderate threats but not panic-related stereotyped escape caused by perceived asphyxiation. Conversely, the PMd projection to the escape-inducing dorsal periaqueductal gray projection is necessary for all tested escapes. Thus, PMd-cck cells control versatile flight, engaging spatial navigation and escape circuits."
https://openalex.org/W3154080360,"Cognitive flexibility, the ability to alter strategy according to changing stimulus-response-reward relationships, is critical for updating learned behavior. Attentional set-shifting, a test of cognitive flexibility, depends on the activity of prefrontal cortex (PFC). It remains unclear, however, what role PFC neurons play to support set-shifting. Using optogenetics and two-photon calcium imaging, we demonstrate that medial PFC activity does not bias sensorimotor responses during set-shifting, but rather enables set-shifting by encoding trial feedback information, a role it has been known to play in other contexts. Unexpectedly, the functional properties of PFC cells did not vary with their efferent projection targets. Instead, representations of trial feedback formed a topological gradient, with cells more strongly selective for feedback information located further from the pial surface, where afferent input from the anterior cingulate cortex was denser. These findings identify a critical role for deep PFC projection neurons in enabling set-shifting through behavioral feedback monitoring."
https://openalex.org/W3152777658,"Epistemic trust (ET) refers to trust in communicated knowledge. This paper describes the development and validation of a new self-report questionnaire, the Epistemic Trust, Mistrust and Credulity Questionnaire (ETMCQ). We report on two studies (Study 1, n = 500; Study 2, n = 705) examining the psychometric properties of the ETMCQ and the relationship between EMTCQ scores (i.e., an individual’s epistemic stance) and exposure to adverse childhood experiences, mental health symptoms, attachment, mentalizing and general self-efficacy. The factor structure of the ETMCQ was examined using Exploratory and Confirmatory Factor Analyses, and its reliability and test-retest reliability were tested. Both studies yielded three correlated yet distinct factors–Trust, Mistrust and Credulity–and confirmed the reliability and validity of the ETMCQ. Preregistered hypotheses were confirmed and replicated across both studies. Main findings suggest intriguing links between the ETMCQ and developmental psychopathology constructs and are consistent with thinking on the role of epistemic stance in undermining adaptation and increasing the developmental risk of mental health problems. Mistrust and Credulity scores were associated with childhood adversity and higher scores on the global psychopathology severity index and both factors partially mediated the link between early adversity and mental health symptoms. Mistrust and Credulity were positively associated with difficulties in understanding mental states and insecure attachment styles. Post-hoc analysis identified that different attachment styles were associated with differences in epistemic stance. In addition, Trust was not associated with reduced levels of mental health symptoms and did not moderate the impact of childhood adversity–findings are congruent with the suggestion that the reduction of mistrust and credulity may be crucial common factors in promoting resilience and the effectiveness of psychotherapeutic interventions. This investigation and the ETMCQ provide an empirical measure of what until now has been largely a theoretical concept and open new avenues for future research."

We trained mice in a visual change detection task designed to separate the covert antecedents of choices from activity associated with their execution. Wide-field calcium imaging across the dorsal cortex revealed fundamentally different dynamics of activity underlying these processes. Although signals related to execution of choice were widespread, fluctuations in sensory evidence in the absence of overt motor responses triggered a confined activity cascade, beginning with transient modulation of visual cortex and followed by sustained recruitment of the secondary and primary motor cortex. Activation of the motor cortex by sensory evidence was modulated by animals’ expectation of when the stimulus was likely to change.

Perceptual decisions involve interaction of sensory information with subjects’ expectations and prior knowledge leading up to behavioral choice (Gold and Shadlen, 2007Gold J.I. Shadlen M.N.

Attributing neuronal responses to these pre-decision processes is challenging because they are inherently correlated with subsequent motor execution-related signals (Murakami and Mainen, 2015Murakami M.

Neurobiol. 2015; 33: 40-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), which have a widespread effect on neural activity.

To separate pre-decision processes from activity related to motor execution, we designed a behavioral task for mice that allowed us to independently probe the influence of sensory information and temporal expectation on neural activity while controlling the animals’ motor output. The task required mice to lick for reward in response to sustained changes in speed of a noisy drifting grating stimulus. Mice were encouraged to respond as soon as they detected the change by restricting the window when the reward was available. Because speed changes were often ambiguous, their timing variable, and the trial difficulty randomized, mice had to continuously monitor the sensory stimulus during an extended period preceding the change. Using a combination of experimental manipulations and post hoc analyses, we separated neural responses underlying evaluation of sensory evidence from those related to execution of motor responses. Importantly, by manipulating animals’ expectation of when sustained changes in speed were likely to occur, we determined how the responses to the same stimulus speed fluctuations were influenced by expectation of when the stimulus was likely to change. We first identified the behavioral strategy used by the mice to detect sustained changes in stimulus speed, showing that they combine stimulus information on a timescale of hundreds of milliseconds with their prior expectation of the timing of changes. Using wide-field calcium imaging of the dorsal neocortex, we identified a cascade of activity induced by fluctuations in stimulus speed. Such fluctuations triggered transient responses in visual areas and culminated in more persistent activation of motor areas in the absence of choice execution. This recruitment of the motor cortex depended on the animals’ experience of the task and was modulated specifically by their temporal expectation of stimulus change. This localized pre-decision cascade contrasted with the widespread emergence of action-related signals associated with the execution of behavioral choice. We trained head-fixed, food-restricted mice in a visual change detection task, which required them to lick for reward in response to a sustained increase (hereafter referred to as change) in the speed of a drifting grating stimulus (Figures 1A and 1B ). The temporal frequency (TF) of the grating stimulus varied around the mean every 50 ms during the baseline (log2 TF = 0 ± 0.25) and the change periods on 70% of trials (referred to as noisy trials; Figure 1C). Such noisy trials provided a window to determine the strategies mice might use to perform the task and to probe stimulus-evoked modulation of cortical activity during decision-making (Huk and Shadlen, 2005Huk A.C. Shadlen M.N. Neural activity in macaque parietal cortex reflects temporal integration of visual motion signals during perceptual decision making.J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 10420-10436Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar; Hanks et al., 2015Hanks T.D. Kopec C.D. Brunton B.W. Duan C.A. Erlich J.C. Brody C.D. Distinct relationships of parietal and prefrontal cortices to evidence accumulation.Nature. 2015; 520: 220-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). After a randomly chosen delay period, the mean TF increased, and the mice were required to lick within a response window of 2 s to receive a drop of soy milk (Figure 1B). The frequency of correct licks depended on the magnitude of the TF change, with mice reliably detecting large increases in TF (Figure 1D; 19,734 noisy trials, 109 sessions, 6 mice). Reaction times were also modulated by the magnitude of stimulus changes, with mice responding more swiftly to larger increases in TF (Figures 1E and 1F). When mice licked prior to the change, the trial was aborted, and mice were penalized with an air puff to the cheek. In addition, we monitored their running speed and aborted the trial in response to movement of the running wheel during the baseline period (STAR Methods). We also collected a separate dataset from the same mice when they were free to run during the entire stimulus presentation (Figures S1A–S1C; 82,005 trials, 281 sessions, 6 mice). To explore whether the timing of early licks was influenced by animals’ expectation of when changes might occur in the stationary version of the task, we varied the distribution of change times during the trial in blocks (Figures 1G and 1H). In early change blocks, changes occurred between 3 and 8 s after stimulus onset in most trials (90%) and between 10.5 and 15.5 s in the remaining trials (10%). The timings were reversed in late change blocks (Videos S1 and S2 show example early and late block trials). Mice varied the timing of early licks based on the probability of changes as a function of time (Figure 1H; probability of changes given that no change has occurred and the trial has not been aborted). The early lick hazard rate (the probability of licks occurring at a given time point given that no early licks or changes have yet occurred) was elevated at the start of the trial in early blocks (Figure 1I) when changes were more frequent. Mice were also faster to respond to the most difficult change during this period when the change was expected (Figure 1J). Therefore, prior expectation of when changes might occur influenced animals’ decisions to lick. https://www.cell.com/cms/asset/b53a09bb-ff91-41ec-af9c-be89c1e8a613/mmc2.mp4Loading ...

For example, mice might decide to lick by integrating visual signals or by detecting fast outliers in the noisily drifting stimulus. Distinguishing between these strategies based on trial-average statistics is challenging (Brunton et al., 2013Brunton B.W. Botvinick M.M. Brody C.D. Rats and humans can optimally accumulate evidence for decision-making.Science. 2013; 340: 95-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). To understand how sensory evidence is transformed into a decision to lick, we took advantage of the stochastic fluctuations in TF in noisy trials and examined the TF content of baseline stimuli preceding early licks by computing the lick-triggered average stimulus. Early licks were preceded by increases in temporal frequency spanning the period of ∼0.25–1 s prior to lick onset (Figure 2A). This observation shows that sensory information over this epoch contributes to animals’ behavior but does not unambiguously reveal how subjects weigh evidence in their decisions to lick (Okazawa et al., 2018Okazawa G. Sha L. Purcell B.A. Kiani R. Psychophysical reverse correlation reflects both sensory and decision-making processes.Nat. Commun. 2018; 9: 3479Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). To answer this question, we developed a statistical model optimized to predict the momentary lick hazard rate during sustained changes in stimulus speed and during the baseline period, based on the history of visual input (2.5 s) and time elapsed since the start of the trial (Figure 2B). To identify features of the stimulus that drove animals’ choices, we restricted stimulus information available to the model to a low-dimensional linear projection of stimulus history, defined as the convolution of stimulus history with a set of filter vectors. Filter outputs and elapsed time were combined by a Gaussian process (GP) non-linearity to estimate the log-odds of licking during each sample of the trial. The model assumes that the contributions of time and stimulus information to the log-odds of licking are additive, which is equivalent to combining current sensory evidence with prior odds of licking based on time since the start of the trial. Although this model has no direct biological interpretation, it provides an unbiased description of how mice transform stimulus information and time since trial start into licks, akin to linear-nonlinear-Poisson models used to characterize neuronal receptive fields. The model accurately captured the trial-average statistics of mouse behavior, including psychometric and chronometric curves (Figures 2C, 2D, and S2) and the timing of early licks (Figure 2E). The full model outperformed models that received stimulus or timing inputs alone (Figures S3A–S3H). We next examined stimulus filters whose weights and numbers were optimized during model training. The shapes of the top two filters were consistent across all mice (n = 6) whose behavior we quantified (Figures 2F and S2). The weights of both filters were close to zero for time lags of 0–0.25 s, a period equivalent to non-decision time, reflecting sensory and motor delays. The first filter resembled the lick-triggered average stimulus and had large positive weights at time lags of ∼0.25–1 s and small negative weights at lags of 1–2 s (Figures 2F and S2). It is therefore sensitive to sustained increases in the TF of the grating over baseline. The second filter was almost symmetric and resembled a derivative filter, with positive weights between ∼0.25 and ∼0.5 s and negative weights between ∼0.5 and ∼1 s (Figures 2F and S2D). It is therefore sensitive to abrupt changes in TF of the grating. The weights of the remaining filters were close to zero, with the exception of the third filter in 2 of 6 mice, which resembled the derivative filter but was shifted in time (Figure S2D). To characterize the contribution of the two filters to model performance, we examined GP models with coefficients of either of the two filters set to 0. Eliminating the first filter dramatically reduced the proportion of hit licks across all stimulus change magnitudes in stationary and running mice (Figures S3I and S3L). On the other hand, eliminating the second filter had a more subtle effect on performance, primarily affecting animals’ responses in the running version of the task (Figure S3I) and increasing reaction times, especially for large stimulus strengths (Figures S3J and S3M). Both filters were more active at the time of hits rather than early licks, with the first filter showing graded activation across all stimulus change magnitudes and the second filter being consistently active for large changes only (Figures S3K and S3N). Thus, both filters primarily contribute to licks during the change period, with the first filter playing a more prominent role. These analyses suggest that mouse behavior is primarily explained by a strategy involving integration of TF on the timescale of ∼1 s and by the expectation of when the sustained changes in stimulus speed might occur. We next systematically characterized the patterns of neural activity underlying processing of sensory signals and their transformation into putative motor commands across the dorsal cortex. To accomplish this, we imaged transgenic mice expressing GCaMP6s in excitatory cortical neurons (Wekselblatt et al., 2016Wekselblatt J.B. Flister E.D. Piscopo D.M. Niell C.M. Large-scale imaging of cortical dynamics during sensory perception and behavior.J. Neurophysiol. 2016; 115: 2852-2866Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar; 11,130 trials, 47 sessions, 6 mice) using a low-magnification epifluorescence microscope that allowed us to simultaneously capture bulk calcium signals across the entire dorsal surface of the mouse neocortex (Figure 3A; STAR Methods). To compensate for changes in fluorescence arising from hemodynamic fluctuations, we interleaved illumination at 470 nm and 405 nm and used frames acquired at 405 nm to estimate the hemodynamic component (Allen et al., 2017Allen W.E. Kauvar I.V. Chen M.Z. Richman E.B. Yang S.J. Chan K. Gradinaru V. Deverman B.E. Luo L. Deisseroth K. Global Representations of Goal-Directed Behavior in Distinct Cell Types of Mouse Neocortex.Neuron. 2017; 94: 891-907.e6Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). In parallel, we monitored animals’ pupil diameter and body and face (snout region) movements (Figure 3A). To identify the imaged brain areas, at the end of each imaging experiment we reconstructed whole-brain volumes using serial two-photon tomography and defined cortical area boundaries based on the Allen Mouse Brain Common Coordinate Framework (CCF; v.3; Figures 3A and S4; STAR Methods). In the presentation of our results, we focus on responses in four cortical areas, which show markedly different patterns of wide-field activity during baseline and change periods: the primary and rostrolateral visual areas (VISp and VISrl, respectively) and primary and secondary motor areas (MOp and MOs, respectively). Responses in all imaged regions of interest (ROIs) are presented in the Supplemental information. We first analyzed dorsal cortical activation patterns around the time of onset of the baseline stimulus (Figure 3B). In trained animals, trial onset was preceded by an anticipatory increase in MOp and MOs activity (Figures 3E and 3F). Presentation of the baseline stimulus triggered sustained activation of primary and secondary visual areas (Figures 3C and 3D; 6,631 noisy trials longer than 1.5 s, 47 sessions, 6 mice; Video S3), followed by recruitment of the secondary motor area (Figure 3F). Although grating onset triggered responses of similar or even larger magnitude in visual areas in naive mice, onset responses in the secondary motor area were markedly weaker (1,680 noisy trials from 10 sessions in 3 mice; Video S3). Thus, we observed strong recruitment of the secondary motor cortex by onset of the visual stimulus even in the absence of movement (Figures 3G–3J) that depended on animals’ experience of the task. https://www.cell.com/cms/asset/1aea46d2-1cc5-4e57-9f71-789fd941549a/mmc4.mp4Loading ...

We next examined the patterns of activity evoked by sustained changes in TF of the grating the mice were trained to detect. Change onset triggered an increase in wide-field fluorescence across the dorsal surface of the cortex in hit trials (Figure 4A; 1,974 noisy trials; Video S4). These responses were apparent earliest in motor areas, reaching half-max (50% of maximum response) 0.48 s after change onset for the strongest stimuli (MOs) compared with 0.6 s for the primary visual area (VISp) (Figures 4B and S5A). In more difficult trials, half-max latencies followed the increase in reaction times. Across stimulus strengths, the time course of neural responses followed the movement of the mouse, as captured by the body camera even prior to detection of licks (Figures 4E, S5B, and S5C). This widespread modulation of cortical activity was not observed in miss trials (Figures S5D and S5E; 463 noisy trials). https://www.cell.com/cms/asset/11a363df-4d5a-4ffa-a11c-d7cf1b9ac7b4/mmc5.mp4Loading ...

Playback at 0.5× speed. When aligned to the onset of licking, wide-field fluorescence responses were stereotyped across stimulus change strengths (Figures 4C, 4D, S6B, and S6C; Video S5) and were similar to early lick responses (Figures 4C, S6D, and S6E; 1,564 noisy trials). Although lick-related activity was global, it did not appear synchronously across the cortex. It was detectable earliest in the secondary motor area and anterior visual and midline areas (anterolateral visual area [VISal], 360 ms prior to lick; anteromedial [VISam], anterior [VISa], rostrolateral visual area [VISrl], MOs, retrosplenial [RSPd], and anterior cingulate area [ACAd], 320 ms; quantified as the time to cross 10% of maximum response on 1.5-Hz change trials). The difference in timing of lick-aligned responses in the VISp and MOs was apparent across change strengths (Figure S6A). https://www.cell.com/cms/asset/98e9742a-bf10-487b-9cd4-8b3f6857c03d/mmc6.mp4Loading ...

Playback at 0.5× speed. Lick-aligned activity dominated but did not fully account for cortical responses following onset of sustained changes in stimulus speed. To illustrate this, we first examined activity in hit trials with long reaction times (>0.84 s). During these trials, change onset triggered a gradual increase in fluorescence, which was modulated by the strength of the stimulus (Figure S5F). However, although no licks were present during this period, this activity was correlated with other overt movements preceding licking, as captured by the body camera (Figure S5G). We next used ridge regression to fit a linear model using stimulus changes and overt body movements as predictors of wide-field fluorescence (Figure 4G). Accounting for execution of motor responses revealed components of wide-field fluorescence related to processing of the sensory stimulus distinct from the global responses following the change (Figure 4H). Based on this regression analysis, change onset was associated with activation of anterior higher visual areas (e.g., area VISrl) and of the secondary motor cortex and with a modest reduction in wide-field fluorescence of the primary visual cortex. The signs of change responses in areas VISp and VISrl may reflect the typical temporal frequency preferences of neurons in these areas (Andermann et al., 2011Andermann M.L. Kerlin A.M. Roumis D.K.

https://openalex.org/W3156010630,"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the leading cancers worldwide, accounting for high morbidity and mortality. The mechanisms governing tumor growth and metastasis in CRC require detailed investigation. The results of the present study indicated that the transcription factor (TF) myocyte enhancer factor 2A (MEF2A) plays a dual role in promoting proliferation and metastasis of CRC by inducing the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and activation of WNT/β-catenin signaling. Aberrant expression of MEF2A in CRC clinical specimens was significantly associated with poor prognosis and metastasis. Functionally, MEF2A directly binds to the promoter region to initiate the transcription of ZEB2 and CTNNB1. Simultaneous activation of the expression of EMT-related TFs and Wnt/β-catenin signaling by MEF2A overexpression induced the EMT and increased the frequency of tumor formation and metastasis. The present study identified a new critical oncogene involved in the growth and metastasis of CRC, providing a potential novel therapeutic target for CRC intervention."
https://openalex.org/W3156396852,"Background Institutional injustice refers to structures that create disparities in resources, opportunities and representation. Marginalised people experience institutional injustice, inequalities and discrimination through intersecting personal characteristics and social circumstances. This study aimed to investigate sources of institutional injustice and their effects on marginalised people with experience of mental health problems. Methods Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 77 individuals from marginalised groups with experience of mental health problems, including psychosis, Black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) populations, complex needs and lived experience as a work requirement. These were analysed inductively enabling sensitising concepts to emerge. Findings Three processes of institutional injustice were identified: not being believed because of social status and personal backgrounds; not being heard where narratives did not align with dominant discourses, and not being acknowledged where aspects of identity were disregarded. Harmful outcomes included disengagement from formal institutions through fear and mistrust, tensions and reduced affiliation with informal institutions when trying to consolidate new ways of being, and damaging impacts on mental health and wellbeing through multiple oppression. Conclusions Institutional injustice perpetuates health inequalities and marginalised status. Master status, arising from dominant discourses and heuristic bias, overshadow the narratives and experiences of marginalised people. Cultural competency has the potential to improve heuristic availability through social understandings of narrative and experience, whilst coproduction and narrative development through approaches such as communities of practice might offer meaningful avenues for authentic expression."
https://openalex.org/W3155302152,"Aqueous fruits extract of Abelmoschus esculentus (L.) Moench (Malvaceae) has been used traditionally in several communities to alleviate elevated blood glucose levels. However, optimized extraction conditions have not been reported. Thus, this study determined the optimal extraction conditions for extracting polyphenols from A . esculentus fruits and evaluated antihyperglycemic activity in vivo . Extraction time, temperature, and solid-to-solvent ratio were optimized using Response Surface Methodology (RSM). Total polyphenols and flavonoids were quantified using the Folin-Ciocalteu and aluminium chloride colorimetric methods, respectively. The fingerprint and quantification of quercetin—a major flavonoid with an antihyperglycemic effect was done using the chromatographic method. The antihyperglycemic activity was determined in a high-fat diet-Streptozotocin rat model. The rats were assigned to five groups (n = 6): Group 1 and 2 were normal and diabetic control received distilled water 1 mL/100g; Treatment group 3 and 4 received standardized A . esculentus fruit extract (AEFE) at a dose of 100 and 200 mg/kg, respectively; Group 5 received 5 mg/kg glibenclamide. All treatments were given orally for 14 days. Measurements of fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and body weight were done weekly. The RSM quadratic model predicted total polyphenols of 22.16 mg GAE/g DW. At optimal conditions of a solid-to-solvent ratio of 5%, extraction time 1 h, and extraction temperature of 70°C, confirmation experiments yield 20.2 [95% CI; 16.7 to 27.6] mg GAE/g DW, implying the model successfully predicted total polyphenols. The extract HPLC fingerprint showed 13 characteristic peaks with 0.45 ± 0.02 μg/g DW of quercetin. Compared with diabetic control, the standardized AEFE reduced FPG level dose-dependently ( P &lt; 0.001) with an EC50 of 141.4 mg/kg. Together, at optimal extraction conditions, extract with a high content of total polyphenols and good antihyperglycemic activity can be obtained. Studies are needed to identify additional polyphenolic compounds and determine their antidiabetic effects."
https://openalex.org/W3155556396,"Photoactive biological systems modify the optical properties of their chromophores, known as spectral tuning. Determining the molecular origin of spectral tuning is instrumental for understanding the function and developing applications of these biomolecules. Spectral tuning in flavin-binding fluorescent proteins (FbFPs), an emerging class of fluorescent reporters, is limited by their dependency on protein-bound flavins, whose structure and hence electronic properties cannot be altered by mutation. A blue-shifted variant of the plant-derived improved light, oxygen, voltage FbFP has been created by introducing a lysine within the flavin-binding pocket, but the molecular basis of this shift remains unconfirmed. We here structurally characterize the blue-shifted improved light, oxygen, voltage variant and construct a new blue-shifted CagFbFP protein by introducing an analogous mutation. X-ray structures of both proteins reveal displacement of the lysine away from the chromophore and opening up of the structure as instrumental for the blue shift. Site saturation mutagenesis and high-throughput screening yielded a red-shifted variant, and structural analysis revealed that the lysine side chain of the blue-shifted variant is stabilized close to the flavin by a secondary mutation, accounting for the red shift. Thus, a single additional mutation in a blue-shifted variant is sufficient to generate a red-shifted FbFP. Using spectroscopy, X-ray crystallography, and quantum mechanics molecular mechanics calculations, we provide a firm structural and functional understanding of spectral tuning in FbFPs. We also show that the identified blue- and red-shifted variants allow for two-color microscopy based on spectral separation.

Applications such as multicolor imaging, design of solely FbFP-based FRET biosensors, multicolor correlative light electron microscopy, chromophore-assisted light inactivation, and LOV-based optogenetics would require development of spectrally shifted FbFPs or LOV domains. In contrast to GFP-like fluorescent reporter proteins, whose absorption and fluorescence maxima can be tuned by exchanging certain chromophore-constituting amino acids (17Shaner N.C. Patterson G.H.

Cell Sci. 2007; 120: 4247-4260Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar), the absorption and fluorescence of FbFPs and other flavoproteins depends on noncovalently bound flavins, whose structure cannot be influenced by mutation. This is a severe drawback of FbFPs, which has so far limited all color-tuning efforts for this important new family of fluorescent reporters. At present, only blue-shifted FbFPs are available, derived by substituting a fully conserved glutamine (Q489 in iLOV) against valine (18Wingen M. Potzkei J. Endres S. Casini G. Rupprecht C. Fahlke C.

For the latter case, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and quantum mechanics molecular mechanics (QM/MM) calculations previously suggested that the introduced lysine (K489 in iLOV–Q489K) flips away from the chromophore, which accounts in theory for the observed blue shift (19Davari M.D. Kopka B.

Likewise, theoretical predictions suggested that the retention of a charged amino acid, such as lysine, close to the flavin mononucleotide (FMN) ring system should result in red-shifted spectral properties (19Davari M.D. Kopka B.

In addition, the transferability of the proposed mutations and mechanisms for spectral tuning have so far not been validated for FbFPs other than iLOV, which however is a prerequisite for widespread implementation. To verify the transferability of the blue-shifting Q489K mutation, identified for the plant FbFP iLOV (19Davari M.D. Kopka B. Wingen M. Bocola M. Drepper T. Jaeger K.E. Schwaneberg U. Krauss U.

B. 2016; 120: 3344-3352Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), we introduced the corresponding Q148K mutation into the recently presented thermostable CagFbFP protein from thermophilic phototrophic bacterium Chloroflexus aggregans (22Nazarenko V.

Sci. 2019; 18: 1793-1805Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast to the monomeric, plant-derived iLOV protein, the bacterial CagFbFP protein is a dimer in solution (22Nazarenko V. Remeeva A. Yudenko A. Kovalev K. Dubenko A. Goncharov I. Kuzmichev P. Rogachev A. Buslaev P. Borshchevskiy V. Mishin A. Dhoke G.V. Schwaneberg U.

Sci. 2019; 18: 1793-1805Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In terms of sequence, iLOV and CagFbFP share only about 40% identical amino acid positions, highlighting the distinct origin of CagFbFP. With regard to its flavin-binding site and the overall LOV domain structure, iLOV and CagFbFP are, however, very similar (C-α atom RMSD 0.58 Å over 104 aligned residues) (22Nazarenko V. Remeeva A. Yudenko A. Kovalev K. Dubenko A. Goncharov I. Kuzmichev P. Rogachev A. Buslaev P. Borshchevskiy V. Mishin A. Dhoke G.V. Schwaneberg U.

Sci. 2019; 18: 1793-1805Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To study the spectral properties of the CagFbFP–Q148K variant, we heterologously produced the variant in Escherichia coli and purified it to homogeneity. The absorption and fluorescence emission spectra of CagFbFP–Q148K are shown in Figure 1, A and B. For comparison, the corresponding spectra of iLOV–Q489K are depicted in Figure 1, C and D. Much like iLOV–Q489K (Fig. 1, C and D; Table 1), CagFbFP–Q148K possesses a blue-shifted S0→S1 absorption band with a maximum at around 444 nm (≈3 nm blue-shifted relative to parental CagFbFP) and a blue-shifted fluorescence-emission maximum (≈6 nm blue shift relative to parental CagFbFP; Fig. 1, A and B; compare the gray dashed line and solid blue line; Table 1). Thus, the spectral effects previously seen in the plant-derived, monomeric iLOV–Q489K protein are well reproduced in the thermostable, dimeric CagFbFP protein of bacterial origin, thus hinting at a conserved structural mechanism.Table 1Photophysical properties of all iLOV and CagFbFP variants studied hereProteinλmax-absorption (nm)λmax-emission (nm)Shift (nm)aRelative to emission maximum of the corresponding parental protein.ФFτav/nsiLOV447496-0.33 ± 0.014.47 ± 0.03iLOV–Q489K441487−90.35 ± 0.014.03 ± 0.08iLOV–Q489K–V392T447502+60.33 ± 0.024.48 ± 0.03CagFbFP447497-0.36 ± 0.01bData present in (22).4.53 ± 0.03CagFbFP–Q148K444491−60.24 ± 0.013.28 ± 0.06CagFbFP–Q148K/I52T450504+70.27 ± 0.013.82 ± 0.05CagFbFP–I52T45049700.38 ± 0.064.42 ± 0.07a Relative to emission maximum of the corresponding parental protein.b Data present in (22Nazarenko V.

Sci. 2019; 18: 1793-1805Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Open table in a new tab To elucidate the structural basis for the blue-shifted spectral properties, we determined the structure of iLOV–Q489K. Tetragonal crystals (space group P43212; one molecule per asymmetric unit) grew within 6 weeks and diffracted up to 1.45 Å resolution. Data and refinement statistics are summarized in Table S1. Globally, the iLOV–Q489K structure is very similar to the structure of parental iLOV (PDB ID: 4EES; RMSD is 0.69 Å over the C-α atoms of 104 aligned residues) showing a typical α+β Per-Arnt-Sim domain topology with the secondary structure elements in the order Aβ-Bβ-Cα-Dα-Eα-Fα-Gβ-Hβ-Iβ. Please note that, the two available parental iLOV structures 4EES (one molecule in the asymmetric unit) and 4EET (two molecules in the asymmetric unit) show a relatively high RMSD value of 0.93 Å for all residues (including the termini), which reduces to 0.55 Å for the LOV core domain only (residues 389–489). Surprisingly, the iLOV–Q489K and parental iLOV structures diverge at the C-terminal end following the introduced lysine (K489 in iLOV–Q489K) (Fig. 2A). Although in parental iLOV the Iβ-strand is constituted by the residues 482 to 491, Iβ is shortened by two residues in iLOV–Q489K and ends at K489, followed by a kink in the subsequent residue, with the C terminus pointing away from the core compared with the parental iLOV (Fig. 2A). In addition, the C-terminal end of Iβ becomes detached from the core (in the following described as unlatching), and the last three C-terminal residues lack detectable density. Interestingly, D491 and G492 have undergone post-translational modification to yield a cyclic imide structure (succinimide), which we speculate to be an artifact of protein aging (23Stephenson R.C. Clarke S. Succinimide formation from aspartyl and asparaginyl peptides as a model for the spontaneous degradation of proteins.J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 6164-6170Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Nonenzymatic intramolecular reactions can result in deamidation-dependent isomerization, and racemization of protein and peptide asparaginyl and aspartyl residues via succinimide intermediates. The rate of deamidation reaction in proteins depends on multiple factors, including the primary sequence, higher-order structure, pH, temperature, and components in the solution. The Asn–Gly is known to be the most common potential deamidation site in proteins (23Stephenson R.C. Clarke S.

Chem. 1989; 264: 6164-6170Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Clarke S.

Chem. 1991; 266: 22549-22556Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In parental iLOV, Q489 forms an H-bond with the FMN-O4 atom. In contrast, in the K489 mutant, the introduced K489 extends away from FMN and forms an H-bond with the O2 atom of the succinimide ring (K489-NZ…SNN-O2, 3.1 Å) (Fig. 2B). Collectively, this results in opening up of the LOV core domain (Fig. 2, A and B), which is expected to result in the influx of solvent molecules. In fact, additional electron density is present close to FMN-N5, which we interpret as an acetate ion (Fig. 2B, Fig. S1A), likely derived from the crystallization screen, which contained acetate buffer. Interestingly, in iLOV–Q489K, this ion occupies the former position of the Q489 side chain of parental iLOV. The K489 conformation, experimentally observed here, is distinct from the ones observed in previous MD simulations, suggesting that the previously described MD-identified K489out conformation (19Davari M.D. Kopka B. Wingen M. Bocola M. Drepper T. Jaeger K.E. Schwaneberg U. Krauss U. Photophysics of the LOV-based fluorescent protein variant iLOV-Q489K determined by simulation and experiment.J. Phys. Chem.

Phys. Chem. B. 2017; 121: 10018-10025Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) represents a local energy minimum. Aside from those differences, the introduced lysine adopts a conformation that is facing away from the chromophore, which, in light of previous QM/MM calculations (19Davari M.D. Kopka B. Wingen M. Bocola M. Drepper T. Jaeger K.E. Schwaneberg U. Krauss U. Photophysics of the LOV-based fluorescent protein variant iLOV-Q489K determined by simulation and experiment.J. Phys. Chem. B. 2016; 120: 3344-3352Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 20Khrenova M.G. Meteleshko Y.I. Nemukhin A.V. Mutants of the flavoprotein iLOV as prospective red-shifted fluorescent markers.J. Phys. Chem. B. 2017; 121: 10018-10025Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), accounts for the blue-shifted spectral properties of the variant, that is, due to the absence of a direct H-bonding interaction between the flavin and the introduced Lys. This is corroborated by the observation that the introduction of hydrophobic residues at the same position is known to also result in blue-shifted spectral properties (18Wingen M. Potzkei J. Endres S. Casini G. Rupprecht C. Fahlke C. Krauss U. Jaeger K.E. Drepper T. Gensch T. The photophysics of LOV-based fluorescent proteins--new tools for cell biology.Photochem. Photobiol. Sci. 2014; 13: 875-883Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Increased solvent influx, as observed in our structures, might result in a reduced magnitude of the blue shift because of the stabilization of solvent/buffer molecules that interact with the flavin (similarly to the Q489 side chain in parental iLOV). To verify that the structural changes, which we observed for iLOV–Q489K, are indeed a consequence of the introduced Q489K mutation and are not due to the observed succinimide modification, we obtained the structure of the corresponding CagFbFP–Q148K variant. Altogether, we were able to obtain three types of CagFbFP–Q148K crystals, all using the precipitant solutions with pH of 6.5 (data and refinement statistics are summarized in Table S1). In all of the obtained models, the C terminus of the protein is clearly unlatched, and the side chain of the introduced lysine is facing away from FMN as was found in iLOV–Q489K (Fig. 2C). Thus, the succinimide modification present in iLOV–Q489K does not influence the backbone and the conformation of the introduced Lys because this modification is absent in all CagFbFP–Q148K structures. Interestingly, the highest-resolution structure (PDB ID: 6YX4, determined at a resolution of 1.36 Å; C-α atom RMSD to iLOV–Q489K of 0.77 Å for 102 aligned residues) revealed a six-membered ring in a chair conformation close to the FMN (Fig. 2D; Fig. S1B), which we speculate to derive from 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid present in the precipitant solution. Interestingly, the protein also crystallized using another precipitant solution for which we obtained crystals in two crystal forms. P21212 crystals (PDB ID: 6YX6) diffracted anisotropically, and we applied ellipsoidal truncation (see Supporting Materials and Methods for details) using the resolution cut-offs of 1.5 and 2.05 Å. Despite having been crystallized under different conditions and in a different space group, all alternative CagFbFP–Q148K structures showed an extended outward-facing K148 conformation and an unlatched C terminus relative to parental iLOV (exemplarily shown for the highest resolution structure, PDB ID: 6YX4; Fig. 2, C and D). Therefore, we conclude that irrespective of the buffer and post-translational modification, the C terminus of the iLOV–Q489K and CagFbFP–Q148K variants is unlatched, the LOV core domain is opened up to allow solvent ingress, and the introduced lysine occupies an extended conformation facing away from the FMN chromophore. The related variant CagFbFP–Q148R, which was recently reported, also shows blue-shifted spectral properties, featuring an unlatched C terminus (26Remeeva A. Nazarenko V.V. Kovalev K. Goncharov I. Yudenko A. Astashkin R. Gordeliy V. Gushchin I. Insights into the mechanisms of LOV domain color tuning from a set of high-resolution X-ray structures.Proteins. 2021; https://doi.org/10.1002/prot.26078Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). We thus suggest these structural changes as the characteristic features for a blue-shifted absorption and emission spectrum, that is, when compared with the parental FbFPs. As shown by our iLOV–Q489K and CagFbFP–Q148K structures presented previously, introduction of the single Q489K/Q148K substitution results in blue-shifted spectra, likely because of the displacement of the introduced lysine away from the FMN chromophore. In contrast, previous computational studies have suggested that retention of a charged lysine close to the chromophore should result in red-shifted spectral properties (19Davari M.D. Kopka B. Wingen M. Bocola M. Drepper T. Jaeger K.E. Schwaneberg U. Krauss U. Photophysics of the LOV-based fluorescent protein variant iLOV-Q489K determined by simulation and experiment.J. Phys. Chem.

Theoretical characterization of the flavin-based fluorescent protein iLOV and its Q489K mutant.J. Phys. Chem. B. 2015; 119: 5176-5183Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). We therefore reasoned that secondary mutations are needed to stabilize the introduced lysine to stay close to the FMN ring system. Based on our iLOV–Q489K structure, we selected G487 and V392 as suitable positions as they are close to the introduced K489 (Fig. S1C), so that side-chain alterations at those sites could stabilize K489 to retain its position close to FMN. Following this rationale, we set out to mutate G487 and V392 in iLOV–Q489K. To sample a larger sequence space and to increase the chances for identifying a red-shifted FbFP variant, we generated two site-saturation libraries of iLOV–Q489K. Overall, 465 clones were screened per library. The fluorescence-emission maxima of a subset of promising variants identified by the screen are given in Table S2. Although saturation mutagenesis at position G487 yielded no variants with red-shifted emission relative to parental iLOV, two variants with red-shifted emission maxima relative to iLOV–Q489K (Table S2, Fig. S2) were identified. Both variants turned out to contain a serine substitution at position G487 (Table S2). Site saturation at position V392 yielded more promising results as overall 16 variants with red-shifted spectral properties could be identified (Table S2). 14 of 16 variants carried a threonine at position 392, whereas two variants contained either a cysteine or an alanine (Table S2). We selected the iLOV–V392T–Q489K variant, with the largest red shift relative to parental iLOV (variant B5-B12; Table S2, 8 nm red shifted fluorescence emission), for further studies, and overexpressed a"
https://openalex.org/W3153143781,"The unfolded protein response (UPR) is activated in pancreatic pathologies and suggested as a target for therapeutic intervention. In this study, we examined activating transcription factor 3 (ATF3), a mediator of the UPR that promotes acinar-to-ductal metaplasia (ADM) in response to pancreatic injury. Since ADM is an initial step in the progression to pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), we hypothesized that ATF3 is required for initiation and progression of PDAC. We generated mice carrying a germline mutation of Atf3 (Atf3-/-) combined with acinar-specific induction of oncogenic KRAS (Ptf1acreERT/+KrasG12D/+). Atf3-/- mice with (termed APK) and without KRASG12D were exposed to cerulein-induced pancreatitis. In response to recurrent pancreatitis, Atf3-/- mice showed decreased ADM and enhanced regeneration based on morphological and biochemical analysis. Similarly, an absence of ATF3 reduced spontaneous pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PanIN) formation and PDAC in Ptf1acreERT/+KrasG12D/+ mice. In response to injury, KRASG12D bypassed the requirement for ATF3 with a dramatic loss in acinar tissue and PanIN formation observed regardless of ATF3 status. Compared to Ptf1acreERT/+KrasG12D/+ mice, APK mice exhibited a significant decrease in pancreatic and total body weight, did not progress through to PDAC, and showed altered pancreatic fibrosis and immune cell infiltration. These findings suggest a complex, multifaceted role for ATF3 in pancreatic cancer pathology."
https://openalex.org/W3153365681,"The Elbe is one of the longest European rivers and features a large, turbid and well-mixed estuary, which runs through the inner city of Hamburg. The Elbe has been closely monitored using classical catch techniques in the past. Here we tested a COI-based eDNA approach for assessing the biodiversity within the Elbe. We sampled three stations in the Elbe, included low and high tide events, as well as two adjoining lakes to compare the recovered faunas. To analyze the data, we employed two different pipelines: the automated mBRAVE pipeline utilizing the BOLD database and one including NCBI BLAST. The number of OTUs with species or higher-level identifications were similar between both approaches with 352 OTUs and 355 OTUs for BLAST and mBRAVE, respectively, however, BLAST searches recovered another 942 unidentified metazoan OTUs. Many taxa were well represented; however, fish species were poorly represented, especially in the Elbe estuary samples. This could be a result of the universal COI primers, which also yielded high read numbers for non-metazoan OTUs, and small-bodies taxa like Rotifera, which might have been sampled together with the eDNA. Our results show a strong tidal influence on the recovered taxa. During low tide, downstream stations resembled sites further upstream, but the former showed a very different OTU composition during high tide and early tide. Such differences might be due to varying impacts of upstream-originating eDNA during tide cycles. Such factors need to be considered when routinely employing eDNA for monitoring programs."
https://openalex.org/W3156688685,"Dataset annotation is a time and labor-intensive task and an integral requirement for training and testing deep learning models. The segmentation of images in life science microscopy requires annotated image datasets for object detection tasks such as instance segmentation. Although the amount of annotated image data has been steadily reduced due to methods such as data augmentation, the process of manual or semi-automated data annotation is the most labor and cost intensive task in the process of cell nuclei segmentation with deep neural networks. In this work we propose a system to fully automate the annotation process of a custom fluorescent cell nuclei image dataset. By that we are able to reduce nuclei labelling time by up to 99.5%. The output of our system provides high quality training data for machine learning applications to identify the position of cell nuclei in microscopy images. Our experiments have shown that the automatically annotated dataset provides coequal segmentation performance compared to manual data annotation. In addition, we show that our system enables a single workflow from raw data input to desired nuclei segmentation and tracking results without relying on pre-trained models or third-party training datasets for neural networks."
https://openalex.org/W3153765537,"Variable number of tandem repeat (VNTR) sequences in the genome can have functional consequences that contribute to human disease. This is the case for the CEL gene, which is specifically expressed in pancreatic acinar cells and encodes the digestive enzyme carboxyl ester lipase. Rare single-base deletions (DELs) within the first (DEL1) or fourth (DEL4) VNTR segment of CEL cause maturity-onset diabetes of the young, type 8 (MODY8), an inherited disorder characterized by exocrine pancreatic dysfunction and diabetes. Studies on the DEL1 variant have suggested that MODY8 is initiated by CEL protein misfolding and aggregation. However, it is unclear how the position of single-base deletions within the CEL VNTR affects pathogenic properties of the protein. Here, we investigated four naturally occurring CEL variants, arising from single-base deletions in different VNTR segments (DEL1, DEL4, DEL9, and DEL13). When the four variants were expressed in human embryonic kidney 293 cells, only DEL1 and DEL4 led to significantly reduced secretion, increased intracellular aggregation, and increased endoplasmic reticulum stress compared with normal CEL protein. The level of O-glycosylation was affected in all DEL variants. Moreover, all variants had enzymatic activity comparable with that of normal CEL. We conclude that the longest aberrant protein tails, resulting from single-base deletions in the proximal VNTR segments, have highest pathogenic potential, explaining why DEL1 and DEL4 but not DEL9 and DEL13 have been observed in patients with MODY8.

Variable number of tandem repeat (VNTR) is a term used to describe short DNA sequence motifs that are consecutively repeated several times in the genome (1Brookes K.J. The VNTR in complex disorders: The forgotten polymorphisms? A functional way forward?.Genomics. 2013; 101: 273-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). As these motifs are very polymorphic and inherited in a Mendelian pattern, they have had a tremendous impact on our ability to identify individuals based on biological samples (2Jeffreys A.J. Wilson V. Thein S.L. Individual-specific ‘fingerprints’ of human DNA.Nature. 1985; 316: 76-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (1465) Google Scholar). The VNTRs are most often located in noncoding regions of the genome, but some are found in promoter regions (3Cai C.Q. Zhang T. Breslin M.B. Giraud M. Lan M.S. Both polymorphic variable number of tandem repeats and autoimmune regulator modulate differential expression of insulin in human thymic epithelial cells.Diabetes. 2011; 60: 336-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) or within coding DNA sequences (4Simpson J.

Genet. 2010; 153: 1228-1233Google Scholar). In such cases, a VNTR may influence the expression levels or functional properties of the corresponding protein. Moreover, as repeated DNA motifs are prone to undergo mutations by DNA slippage and unequal crossing-over, VNTRs affecting the protein product are intriguing candidates for human disease associations (1Brookes K.J.

A single-base deletion (DEL) in the first repeat of the CEL VNTR leads to maturity-onset diabetes of the young, type 8 (MODY8), a dominantly inherited syndrome of exocrine pancreatic dysfunction and diabetes (16Ræder H.

Another single-base deletion in the fourth repeat of the CEL VNTR was found in a family with a similar phenotype as the original MODY8 family (16Ræder H. Johansson S. Holm P.I. Haldorsen I.S. Mas E. Sbarra V. Nermoen I. Eide S.Å. Grevle L. Bjørkhaug L. Sagen J.V. Aksnes L. Søvik O. Lombardo D.

Genet. 2006; 38: 54-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar), and this protein will be denoted as DEL4. Owing to frameshifts and premature stop codons, DEL1 and DEL4 are both truncated CEL variants with aberrant protein C termini (Fig. 1). Very rare single-base deletions in the more distal repeats of the CEL VNTR have been observed when screening population-based materials (own unpublished data). It is unknown whether such variants also associate with the disease. We have previously shown that DEL1 has a high propensity to form both intracellular and extracellular aggregates (18Johansson B.B.

We have also found that after secretion, there is cellular reuptake followed by lysosomal degradation of the DEL1 protein, resulting in reduced viability of pancreatic cell lines (17Dalva M.

Furthermore, we have reported that DEL1 causes endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, induction of the unfolded protein response, and subsequent apoptosis (20Xiao X. Jones G. Sevilla W.A. Stolz D.B. Magee K.E. Haughney M. Mukherjee A. Wang Y. Lowe M.E. A carboxyl ester lipase (CEL) mutant causes chronic pancreatitis by forming intracellular aggregates that activate apoptosis.J. Biol. Chem. 2016; 291: 23224-23236Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Taken together, these results indicate that the CEL protein in MODY8 has acquired a negative gain-of-function effect and that the disease follows the protein misfolding–dependent pathway of pancreatitis (21Sahin-Toth M. Genetic risk in chronic pancreatitis: The misfolding-dependent pathway.Curr. Opin. Gastroenterol. 2017; 33: 390-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The aim of the present study was to examine the pathogenicity of single-base deletions naturally occurring in the CEL VNTR. We tested how the position of a deletion within this region affects the functional properties of the encoded CEL protein variant. We therefore compared the DEL1 and DEL4 variants causing MODY8 with two deletions (DEL9 and DEL13) that we have observed in the general population. Our data suggest a correlation between the position of a CEL VNTR single-base deletion and its functional impact on the protein, where increasingly distal mutations have less pathogenic potential. In previous cellular studies of the pathogenic DEL1 variant, we have expressed the protein both with and without a V5/His epitope tag fused to the C terminus (15El Jellas K. Johansson B.B. Fjeld K.

Although epitope tags are very useful tools for protein purification and detection, the charged and hydrophilic residues of such tags may sometimes have a significant impact on the biochemical properties of the protein (22Amarasinghe C. Jin J.P. The use of affinity tags to overcome obstacles in recombinant protein expression and purification.Protein Pept. Lett. 2015; 22: 885-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 23Kosobokova E.N. Skrypnik K.A. Kosorukov V.S. Overview of fusion tags for recombinant proteins.Biochemistry (Mosc.). 2016; 81: 187-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Before initiating the functional study of our set of CEL DEL variants, we therefore investigated how the V5/His tag might influence the CEL protein. Human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) cells were transiently transfected with plasmids expressing DEL1 with and without tag, followed by either cellular fractionation and Western blotting or immunocytochemistry. As controls, we included a construct encoding the normal CEL protein with 16 repeats (WT) and a construct with a stop codon introduced at the beginning of VNTR segment 1 (TRUNC, Fig. 1). The latter construct encodes a truncated CEL protein that has no repeated segments and is unlikely to undergo O-glycosylation. It is an artificial variant not being reported in human materials. We found the WT and DEL1 proteins expressed without the V5/His tag to be less secreted than the tagged variants (Fig. 2A). In addition, the untagged variants showed slightly stronger bands in the detergent-insoluble pellet fraction, indicating that they are more prone to aggregate. Consistent with these findings, confocal imaging demonstrated a stronger intracellular signal for the untagged WT and DEL1 proteins than for their tagged counterparts (Fig. 2B). The TRUNC protein did not display clear differences with or without the tag in our experiments. Based on these results, we concluded that the V5/His tag may increase the solubility of CEL protein variants, possibly via interactions involving the VNTR-encoded region. In previous studies with tagged variants (17Dalva M. Lavik I.K. El Jellas K. Gravdal A. Lugea A. Pandol S.J. Njølstad P.R. Waldron R.T. Fjeld K. Johansson B.B. Molven A.

Chem. 2014; 289: 29097-29111Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), we may therefore have underestimated the detrimental cellular effects of DEL1. Consequently, we decided to use only untagged protein variants in the present study. We have previously shown that the disease-causing DEL1 variant exhibits intracellular retention and reduced secretion (20Xiao X. Jones G. Sevilla W.A. Stolz D.B. Magee K.E. Haughney M. Mukherjee A. Wang Y. Lowe M.E. A carboxyl ester lipase (CEL) mutant causes chronic pancreatitis by forming intracellular aggregates that activate apoptosis.J. Biol. Chem. 2016; 291: 23224-23236Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In the first article describing MODY8, we also identified a family with a DEL4 mutation of CEL (16Ræder H. Johansson S. Holm P.I. Haldorsen I.S. Mas E. Sbarra V. Nermoen I. Eide S.Å. Grevle L. Bjørkhaug L. Sagen J.V. Aksnes L. Søvik O. Lombardo D. Molven A. et al.Mutations in the CEL VNTR cause a syndrome of diabetes and pancreatic exocrine dysfunction.Nat. Genet. 2006; 38: 54-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar), but this variant has not been studied functionally. When screening 1287 subjects of the general Norwegian population, we observed three subjects having a DEL9 mutation, that is, a single–base deletion in segment number 9 of the CEL VNTR. This corresponded to a carrier frequency of 0.0023. Similarly, we identified one subject with a single–base deletion in VNTR segment 13 (DEL13, carrier frequency 0.0008). We therefore decided to test how the position of the deletion within the VNTR might affect pathogenicity by investigating the identified set of CEL variants with mutations in different repeat segments (Table 1; Fig. 1). Constructs encoding the CEL-WT and CEL-TRUNC proteins were included as reference variants in all experiments. Initially, we studied the effect of the four protein variants on secretion and intracellular distribution. HEK293 cells were transiently transfected with the six constructs, and the conditioned medium, soluble lysate, and insoluble pellet were analyzed by Western blotting.Table 1Analyzed single-base deletions in the VNTR region of the CEL geneVariant designationNucleotide changeaPosition according to NCBI reference mRNA sequence NM_001807.4 (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/NM_001807.4).Amino acid changeDEL1c.1686delTp.Val563Cysfs∗132DEL4c.1785delCp.

Open table in a new tab DEL, deletion; VNTR, variable number of tandem repeat. When compared with CEL-WT, secretion and intracellular distribution varied substantially between the variants (Fig. 3). We found significantly reduced secretion for DEL1 (38-fold), DEL4 (7.5-fold), and TRUNC (23-fold). In contrast, variants DEL9 and DEL13 displayed a secretion level similar to that of the WT protein. In the pellet fraction, there was a 2.8-fold increase for DEL1, 2.1-fold increase for DEL4, and 6.4-fold increase for TRUNC. Band intensities of DEL9 and DEL13 appeared slightly stronger than for the WT protein, but differences were not statistically significant. Moreover, significantly lower levels of all DEL variants (DEL1: 7.4-fold, DEL4: 7.1-fold, DEL9: 4.2-fold, DEL13: 2.1-fold) were detected in the soluble lysate fraction (Fig. 3). TRUNC exhibited a 2.5-fold reduction that did not reach statistical significance because of large experimental variation. The general decrease in abundance of all variants in the lysate fraction when compared with the CEL-WT level is likely to reflect their increased abundance in the pellet fraction. The intracellular levels of the variants should be considered as a total of the lysate and pellet fraction and appear as such to be relatively constant. Interestingly, the four DEL variants migrated with clearly different band sizes in the SDS-PAGE gels despite having very similar predicted molecular masses (compare Figs. 1 and 3). This suggested that the variants differ at the level of post-translational modification. Because CEL is heavily O-glycosylated (13Wang C.S. Dashti A. Jackson K.W. Yeh J.C. Cummings R.D. Tang J.

Chem. 1997; 272: 27353-27361Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), a likely explanation for the observed size differences could be variations in O-glycosylation. Prediction of theoretical O-glycosylation sites in the VNTR region revealed that CEL-WT has the highest number of potential sites (n = 36), whereas DEL1, DEL4, DEL9, and DEL13 contain 13, 18, 23, and 26 sites, respectively (Fig. S1). Thus, the proximal DEL variants DEL1 and DEL4 have fewer predicted O-glycosylation sites than the distal variants DEL9 and DEL13. This observation might at least to some degree explain the migration differences observed in Figure 3. To experimentally investigate the effect of O-glycosylation on the various DEL variants, an isogenic cell model with (HEK293 SimpleCells) and without (regular HEK293 cells) KO of the gene encoding the Cosmc chaperone was used (25Steentoft C. Vakhrushev S.Y. Joshi H.J. Kong Y. Vester-Christensen M.B. Schjoldager K.T.B.G. Lavrsen K. Dabelsteen S. Pedersen N.B. Marcos-Silva L. Gupta R. Bennett E.P. Mandel U. Brunak S.

Cell Biol. 2008; 182: 531-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). As a result of this KO, the enzymatic activity that provides O-glycan elongation beyond the initial GalNAc-α1 residue on O-linked glycoproteins (T-synthase) is absent. We transfected SimpleCells and their nonaltered HEK293 counterparts with the different CEL variants and analyzed the protein mass by Western blotting (Fig. 4). We found that most variants showed a ∼20-kDa reduction in band migration when expressed in SimpleCells, reflecting the presence of truncated O-glycans in the C terminus of CEL. Notably, DEL1 was the only variant whose migration in the lysate fraction of the SimpleCells corresponded to its predicted theoretical mass (∼75 kDa). It was also the DEL variant with least efficient secretion in both cell lines. While SimpleCells secreted CEL proteins with two different sizes into the medium, HEK293 cells secreted the variants as only one prominent band, representing the mature and heavily glycosylated form of the protein (compare the right panels of Fig. 4). Proteins can undergo the initial O-glycosylation step in SimpleCells (i.e., attachment of GalNAc-α1 onto Ser/Thr residues), which probably explains why size differences still are present after expressing the DEL variants in this cellular model. Taken together, our results indicate that full O-glycosylation is important for efficient expression and secretion of CEL and that the level of O-glycosylation varies considerably between the DEL variants. Expression of the DEL1 variant induces ER stress in both HEK293 cells and in the pancreatic acinar cell line AR42J (20Xiao X. Jones G. Sevilla W.A. Stolz D.B. Magee K.E. Haughney M. Mukherjee A.

In the present study, we wanted to confirm this finding and to compare the ability of the different DEL variants to cause ER stress, both at the mRNA and the protein levels. In addition to analyzing an ER stress master regulator (the chaperone GRP78), all three branches of the unfolded protein response were investigated, namely the PERK, IRE1a, and ATF6 pathways (27Hetz C. Papa F.R. The unfolded protein response and cell fate control.Mol. Cell. 2018; 69: 169-181Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar). HEK293 cells were transiently transfected with our set of CEL variants, followed by expression analysis of six marker genes (Fig. 5).

The pathway for 4-HB production in eukaryotes has not been elucidated, but the first and last steps have been described recently. 4-Hydroxyphenylpyruvate (4-HPP) is a requisite early precursor made from tyrosine through aminotransferases Aro8 and Aro9 or de novo through the shikimate pathway (14Payet L.A. Leroux M. Willison J.C. Kihara A. Pelosi L. Pierrel F. Mechanistic details of early steps in coenzyme Q biosynthesis pathway in yeast.Cell Chem. Biol. 2016; 23: 1241-1250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The last step in the pathway is the oxidation of 4-hydroxbenzaldehyde (4-HBz) to 4-HB, catalyzed by the broad-specificity aldehyde dehydrogenase Hfd1 (14Payet L.A. Leroux M. Willison J.C. Kihara A.

Biotechnol. 2016; 34: 1191-1197Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). However, the intermediates and enzymes involved in converting 4-HPP to 4-HBz are unidentified (Fig. 1A). Established metabolic pathways provide hypotheses about the tyrosine to 4-HB pathway. The Ehrlich pathway is a general route to catabolize aromatic and branched-chain amino acids (16Hazelwood L.A. Daran J.M. van Maris A.J. Pronk J.T. Dickinson J.R. The Ehrlich pathway for fusel alcohol production: A century of research on Saccharomyces cerevisiae metabolism.Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2008; 74: 2259-2266Crossref PubMed Scopus (769) Google Scholar) (Fig. S1). After Aro8 and Aro9 convert tyrosine to 4-HPP, the aromatic α-keto acid decarboxylase Aro10 converts 4-HPP to 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde (4-HPAA) (17Kneen M.M. Stan R. Yep A. Tyler R.P. Saehuan C. McLeish M.J. Characterization of a thiamin diphosphate-dependent phenylpyruvate decarboxylase from Saccharomyces cerevisiae.FEBS J. 2011; 278: 1842-1853Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). 4-HPAA is then reduced to tyrosol or oxidized to 4-hydroxyphenylacetate (4-HPA) depending on cellular needs (16Hazelwood L.A. Daran J.M. van Maris A.J. Pronk J.T. Dickinson J.R. The Ehrlich pathway for fusel alcohol production: A century of research on Saccharomyces cerevisiae metabolism.Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2008; 74: 2259-2266Crossref PubMed Scopus (769) Google Scholar), but it is unclear whether any of these intermediates contribute to 4-HB synthesis. Aspergillus niger readily converts 4-HPAA to 4-HB through a series of oxidations and decarboxylations resembling the mandelate pathway, although the enzymes involved are unidentified, and it is possible that S. cerevisiae converts 4-HPAA in a similar fashion (18Kishore G. Sugumaran M. Vaidyanathan C.S. Metabolism of Dl-(+/-)-phenylalanine by Aspergillus-Niger.J. Bacteriol. 1976; 128: 182-191Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Ramakrishna Rao D.N. Vaidyanathan C.S. Metabolism of mandelic acid by Neurospora crassa.Can. J. Microbiol. 1977; 23: 1496-1499Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). There is also recent evidence for a nonoxidative route from 4-HPP to 4-HBz, as p-coumarate was shown to be incorporated into CoQ in both yeast and human cells (20Xie L.X. Williams K.J. He C.H. Weng E. Khong S. Rose T.E. Kwon O. Bensinger S.J. Marbois B.N. Clarke C.F. Resveratrol and para-coumarate serve as ring precursors for coenzyme Q biosynthesis.J. Lipid Res. 2015; 56: 909-919Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that p-coumarate could be hydrated and then cleaved by a carbon–carbon lyase to produce 4-HBz and acetate (14Payet L.A. Leroux M. Willison J.C. Kihara A. Pelosi L. Pierrel F. Mechanistic details of early steps in coenzyme Q biosynthesis pathway in yeast.Cell Chem. Biol. 2016; 23: 1241-1250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Despite these promising hints, neither the oxidative nor nonoxidative pathway has been explored in detail. Here, we set out to identify intermediates and enzymes involved in converting tyrosine to 4-HB. To study the fate of 4-HPP in 4-HB synthesis, we constructed a W303 Δaro8Δaro9Δaro2 strain as a negative control, hypothesizing that it would be unable to produce 4-HPP (Fig. 1A). Respiratory growth was only moderately impaired in –pABA glycerol media (Fig. 1B), and we observed only a moderate CoQ deficiency (Fig. 1C), consistent with BY4741 Δaro8Δaro9Δaro2 (14Payet L.A. Leroux M. Willison J.C. Kihara A. Pelosi L. Pierrel F. Mechanistic details of early steps in coenzyme Q biosynthesis pathway in yeast.Cell Chem. Biol. 2016; 23: 1241-1250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). We asked how Δaro8Δaro9Δaro2 yeast can make CoQ, given that both routes to 4-HPP synthesis (tyrosine aminotransferase and shikimate pathway) are presumably blocked. We reasoned that there is either redundant tyrosine aminotransferase activity present in this strain or a 4-HPP-independent route for 4-HB synthesis. To differentiate between these two models, we measured 4-HPP production in Δaro8Δaro9Δaro2 yeast. There was a small amount of 4-HPP made in this strain (Fig. 1D), which is likely sufficient to support 4-HB synthesis. Yeast possesses 12 α-amino acid aminotransferases including Aro8 and Aro9, and we hypothesized that the other ten of these enzymes are the most likely candidates for redundant tyrosine aminotransferase activity. Aminotransferases are typically able to catalyze transamination in both directions (albeit with different efficiencies), as demonstrated by the ability of both Aro8 and Aro9 to interconvert tyrosine and 4-HPP. Therefore, to test this hypothesis, we individually overexpressed all 12 α-amino acid aminotransferases in an Δaro8Δaro9 strain, which is auxotrophic for tyrosine because it cannot make enough de novo tyrosine from 4-HPP to support protein synthesis (21Urrestarazu A. Vissers S. Iraqui I. Grenson M. Phenylalanine- and tyrosine-auxotrophic mutants of Saccharomyces cerevisiae impaired in transamination.Mol. Gen. Genet. 1998; 257: 230-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Only Aro8, Aro9, Bna3, Bat2, and Aat2 were sufficient to confer tyrosine prototrophy, indicating that these enzymes can interconvert tyrosine and 4-HPP in vivo (Fig. 1E). Deleting Bna3, Bat2, and Aat2 from the Δaro8Δaro9Δaro2 strain blocked respiratory growth, which was rescuable with 4-HB supplementation (Fig. 1F). The Δaro8Δaro9Δaro2Δbna3Δbat2 and Δaro8Δaro9Δaro2Δaat2 strains are respiratory-competent, suggesting that BNA3, BAT2, and AAT2 must all be deleted to block CoQ synthesis. We also observed that 4-HB supplementation did not fully rescue Δaat2 strains, indicating that Aat2 is required for normal respiratory growth independent of 4-HB production. Altogether, these results establish that five aminotransferases—Aro8, Aro9, Bat2, Bna3, and Aat2—redundantly convert tyrosine to 4-HPP in vivo and emphasize the minute amount of 4-HPP production required for CoQ synthesis. Thus far, HFD1 is the only known gene required for converting 4-HPP to 4-HB (Fig. 1A). In an attempt to discover other genes, we performed forward-genetic screens by mutagenizing yeast with ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS) and isolating colonies requiring exogenous 4-HB for respiratory growth in media lacking pABA (Fig. 2A). In total, we performed eight of these screens with various sensitized background strains that collectively yielded 15 mutant strains deficient in 4-HB synthesis (Fig. 2B; Table 1). Thirteen of these mutants harbor missense mutations in HFD1, and two harbor missense mutations in COQ2, which encodes a 4-HB polyprenyltransferase that functions downstream of 4-HB synthesis (22Ashby M.N. Kutsunai S.Y. Ackerman S. Tzagoloff A. Edwards P.A. COQ2 is a candidate for the structural gene encoding para-hydroxybenzoate:polyprenyltransferase.J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4128-4136Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Notably, both mutated Coq2 residues reside in its putative 4-HB binding site (23Cheng W. Li W. Structural insights into ubiquinone biosynthesis in membranes.Science. 2014; 343: 878-881Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), and therefore these mutant strains likely require 4-HB supplementation to overcome decreased 4-HB affinity and catalytic efficiency. Our inability to detect mutations in additional genes while consistently recovering HFD1 suggests that other enzymes involved in 4-HB synthesis are likely either essential for growth under our screening conditions or perform a redundant function in the pathway. This redundancy could arise from multiple enzymes performing each step (like the aminotransferases above), the existence of multiple distinct pathways, or both.Table 1Details of forward-genetic screensMutantBackground strainControl plate additiveRescue plate additiveControl growth rate (mOD/min)Control growth s.d.Rescue growth rate (mOD/min)Rescue growth s.d.Mutated geneAA changeABY4742 Δaro2Δaro10Water4-HB (10 μM)−0.0020.0020.0380.005HFD1G331D,G504DBBY4742 Δaro2Δaro10Water4-HB (10 μM)0.0030.0030.0990.012HFD1W371XCBY4742 Δaro2Δaro10Δpdc5Water4-HB (10 μM)0.0110.0070.1070.013HFD1G193RDBY4742 Δaro10Δpdc5Water4-HB (10 μM)0.0050.0050.3080.024HFD1C422YEBY4742 Δaro10Δpdc5Δpdc6Δabz1Water4-HB (10 μM)0.0080.0060.1210.053HFD1G193R, E299KFBY4742 Δaro10Δpdc5Δpdc6Δabz1Water4-HB (10 μM)00.0030.0480.025HFD1G130DGW303 Δcoq6 + Coq6 G386A/N388D3,4-diHMA (1 mM)3,4-diHB (100 μM)0.0420.0170.4490.052HFD1S164NHW303 Δcoq6 + Coq6 G386A/N388D3,4-diHMA (100 μM)3,4-diHB (30 μM)0.0030.0110.1480.02HFD1T396IIW303 Δcoq6 + Coq6 G386A/N388D3,4-diHMA (100 μM)3,4-diHB (30 μM)−0.0040.0020.450.038HFD1P137LJW303 Δaro8Δaro9Δaro2Δgly1Water4-HB (10 μM)0.0170.151HFD1G447DKW303 Δaro8Δaro9Δaro2Δbat2Δbna3Δyer152cWater4-HB (10 μM)0.0070.0010.120.009HFD1Q192XLW303 Δaro8Δaro9Δaro2Δbat2Δbna3Δyer152cWater4-HB (10 μM)00.0010.2490.004HFD1G214DMW303 Δaro8Δaro9Δaro2Δbat2Δbna3Δyer152cWater4-HB (10 μM)0.0170.0060.1370.02HFD1G130SNW303 Δaro8Δaro9Δaro2Δbat2Water4-HB (10 μM)0.0020.0020.0190.008COQ2G136DOW303 Δaro8Δaro9Δaro2Δgly1Water4-HB (10 μM)−0.0040.0040.0140.001COQ2R135K Open table in a new tab Because our extensive genetic screens did not identify new pathway enzymes, we next set out to map the intermediates between 4-HPP and 4-HBz by identifying tyrosine catabolites and 4-HB precursors. To determine whether potential pathway intermediates are bona fide tyrosine catabolites, we supplemented yeast with heavy (13C-labeled) tyrosine, extracted metabolites, and performed targeted liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (LC-MS). In wild-type (WT) yeast, we observed multiple heavy-labeled compounds after supplementing with heavy tyrosine, some of which (e.g., 4-HPP, 4-HBz, 4-HB) have already been linked to 4-HB synthesis (Fig. 3A). Among the other catabolites we identified, the most abundant were tyrosol, 4-hydroxyphenylacetate (4-HPA), and 4-hydroxyphenyllactate (4-HPL). Phenylalanine catabolites phenylpyruvate (PP) and phenyllactate (PL) were not labeled, consistent with the documented inability of yeast to interconvert tyrosine and phenylalanine (24Braus G.H. Aromatic amino acid biosynthesis in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae: A model system for the regulation of a eukaryotic biosynthetic pathway.Microbiol. Rev. 1991; 55: 349-370Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 3A). We constructed a model of the tyrosine to 4-HB pathway using our absolute quantification data from WT yeast, highlighting the low steady-state levels of 4-HBz and 4-HB compared with earlier intermediates (Fig. 3B). Next, we repeated this targeted LC-MS approach with Δhfd1 yeast to see if any upstream intermediates accumulate in this strain. 4-HB was heavily decreased, as expected, but we noted an unexpected decrease in 4-HPP, 4-HPA, and 4-HBz relative to WT yeast (Fig. 3C). A possible explanation for these changes is the concomitant increase in 4-HPL abundance in Δhfd1. This altered 4-HPP/4-HPL ratio may be due specifically to loss of Hfd1 or may be the result of general respiratory deficiency. In the latter case, reducing 4-HPP to 4-HPL could act as an electron sink to regenerate depleted oxidized redox cofactors such as NAD+ in a manner analogous to the reduction of pyruvate to lactate (25Lunt S.Y. Vander Heiden M.G. Aerobic glycolysis: Meeting the metabolic requirements of cell proliferation.Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2011; 27: 441-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (1423) Google Scholar). To distinguish between these possibilities, we performed targeted LC-MS on Δhfd1 yeast, whose respiratory deficiency could be rescued with pABA, and Δcoq2 yeast, a respiratory-deficient control (Fig. 3D). The 4-HPP/4-HPL ratio was sharply decreased in Δcoq2 yeast, matching Δhfd1, and rescuing Δhfd1 respiratory growth with pABA restored the 4-HPP/4-HPL ratio (Fig. 3E). Similar results were observed with the analogous phenylalanine catabolites PP and PL, demonstrating that these changes are not specific to tyrosine metabolism (Fig. 3F). These data suggest that the perturbed 4-HPP/4-HPL ratio in Δhfd1 stems from an indirect effect of respiratory deficiency rather than the lack of Hfd1, explaining the counterintuitive observation that upstream intermediates decrease in abundance in Δhfd1 yeast. More broadly, this result suggests that 4-HPP and PP have underappreciated roles in buffering the cellular redox state during perturbed cellular respiration. Having identified intermediates derived from tyrosine, we next asked which of these compounds can be converted to 4-HB in vivo. Potential 4-HB precursors were added to Δaro8Δaro9Δaro2 yeast to determine whether they could rescue this strain's respiratory growth defect. Of the tested compounds, 4-HPAA and 4-hydroxymandelate (4-HMA) rescued most strongly (Fig. 4A). Notably, 4-HPA and 4-HPL, compounds that were abundantly labeled in the targeted LC-MS assay, did not rescue respiratory growth. We verified that 4-HPAA and 4-HMA do not rescue Δhfd1 yeast, demonstrating that their conversion to 4-HB depends on Hfd1 activity and that there is no appreciable 4-HB contamination in these compound stocks (Fig. 4B). To further validate these findings, we performed rescue experiments in a Coq6 “bypass” strain. Coq6 is an essential enzyme in the CoQ biosynthesis pathway that hydroxylates the CoQ precursor polyprenyl hydroxybenzoate (PPHB) at the C3 position. However, a strain containing an activity-dead Coq6 mutant (G386A, N388D) can be bypassed with a “pre-hydroxylated” 3,4-dihydroxybenzoate (3,4-diHB) (26Ozeir M. Muhlenhoff U. Webert H. Lill R. Fontecave M. Pierrel F. Coenzyme Q biosynthesis: Coq6 is required for the C5-hydroxylation reaction and substrate analogs rescue Coq6 deficiency.Chem. Biol. 2011; 18: 1134-1142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). We tested whether 3,4-dihydroxy analogs of various hypothesized 4-HB precursors could also rescue the Coq6-dead strain. 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetaldehyde (3,4-diHPAA) and 3,4-dihydroxymandelate (3,4-diHMA) rescued respiratory growth while 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetate (3,4-diHPA) did not, consistent with the results with the 4-hydroxy compounds in Δaro8Δaro9Δaro2 (Fig. 4C). Once again, Hfd1 was required for conversion to 4-HB. Paradoxically, the most abundant tyrosine catabolites observed with targeted LC-MS (4-HPA and 4-HPL) did not rescue our 4-HB-deficient strains, while the compounds that rescued best (4-HPAA and 4-HMA) were not observed and verified as tyrosine catabolites (Fig. 4D). A possible explanation is that compounds that we observe at steady state might be rate-limiting or unproductive intermediates, while compounds we do not observe might be converted too quickly to accumulate. Of note, we were unable to measure 4-HPAA in the LC-MS assay, so it is unclear if a pool of 4-HPAA is present in vivo. Multiple compounds including 4-HPAA, 4-HPA, and 4-HMA are likely positioned downstream of the Ehrlich pathway aromatic α-keto acid decarboxylase Aro10 (Fig. 4D; Fig. S1). To further examine whether these compounds support 4-HB synthesis, we deleted Aro10 and the potentially redundant decarboxylases Pdc5 and Pdc6 (27Romagnoli G. Luttik M.A. Kotter P. Pronk J.T. Daran J.M. Substrate specificity of thiamine pyrophosphate-dependent 2-oxo-acid decarboxylases in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2012; 78: 7538-7548Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The Δaro10Δpdc5Δpdc6 strain had elevated levels of 4-HPP, the putative substrate of Aro10 in tyrosine catabolism (Fig. 5A). 4-HPL levels were similarly increased (Fig. 5B), supporting the hypothesis that 4-HPL exists in an equilibrium with 4-HPP as an electron sink. 4-HPA and tyrosol, intermediates likely downstream of the Aro10 product 4-HPAA, were sharply decreased but not eliminated, providing further evidence that Aro10 decarboxylates 4-HPP to 4-HPAA in WT yeast (Fig. 5, C and D). However, the effect of these knockouts on 4-HB synthesis was minimal, as 4-HBz and 4-HB levels were unchanged or even increased (Fig. 5, E and F). This demonstrates that Aro10 is dispensable for 4-HB synthesis and suggests that either the smaller pool of 4-HPAA in Δaro10Δpdc5Δpdc6 is sufficient to make the same amount of 4-HB or that 4-HPAA is simply not converted to 4-HB. If 4-HPAA is converted to 4-HB, we reasoned that Δaro8Δaro9Δaro2 yeast, which has decreased levels of 4-HPP and downstream compounds, might be sensitive to Aro10 deletion. However, deleting Aro10 and Pdc5 from Δaro8Δaro9Δaro2 did not affect respiratory growth (Fig. 5G) or CoQ levels (Fig. 5H). We also hypothesized that overexpressing Aro10 in Δaro8Δaro9Δaro2 yeast might help or harm 4-HB synthesis if 4-HPP conversion to 4-HPAA is productive or unproductive, respectively. However, we observe no change in respiratory growth (Fig. 5I) or CoQ levels (Fig. 5J) upon Aro10 overexpression. Overall, these results call into question the recent claim that Aro10 is involved in 4-HBz synthesis in S. cerevisiae (28Valera M.J. Boido E. Ramos J.C. Manta E. Radi R. Dellacassa E. Carrau F.

Genetic and transcriptomic evidences suggest ARO10 genes are involved in benzenoid biosynthesis by yeast.Yeast. 2020; 37: 427-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). Studies of genetic robustness in yeast suggest that, even though only 10–20% of genes are essential, most genes are involved in functions that can only be interrogated with multiple genetic or environmental perturbations (30Deutscher D.

Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 2307-2312Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Our results demonstrate that the yeast tyrosine-to-4-HB pathway contains significant redundancy and indicate that multiple gene knockouts are required to ablate steps prior to Hfd1's conversion of 4-HBz to 4-HB. For example, the first reaction in the pathway, transamination of tyrosine to 4-HPP, is catalyzed primarily by Aro8 and Aro9, but we observe that deleting these two enzymes is not sufficient to block this step. We determine that three additional aminotransferases—Bat2, Bna3, and Aat2—are sufficient to perform this reaction in vivo and that deletion all five of these enzymes is required to block 4-HPP production from tyrosine. Thus, yeast α-amino acid aminotransferases have a broader substrate specificity than previously thought, as five of 12 of these enzymes accept tyrosine as a substrate in vivo. The last step in the 4-HB synthesis pathway is catalyzed by Hfd1, another broad-specificity enzyme whose substrates range from small aromatic aldehydes (4-HBz in CoQ synthesis) to long-chain fatty aldehydes (hexadecanal in sphingolipid catabolism) (14Payet L.A. Leroux M. Willison J.C. Kihara A. Pelosi L. Pierrel F. Mechanistic details of early steps in coenzyme Q biosynthesis pathway in yeast.Cell Chem.

Biotechnol. 2016; 34: 1191-1197Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). These examples suggest that other pathway enzymes might also have broad substrate specificities, and we expect that the relatively low amount of 4-HB required for respiratory growth means that even “side activities” could suffice. We used two strategies to identify metabolic intermediates that could be participating in 4-HB synthesis. First, we observed bona fide tyrosine catabolites with isotopic labeling, including 4-HPL, 4-HPA, and tyrosol. Second, we identified compounds that boost respiratory growth when added exogenously, including 4-HPAA and 4-HMA. Surprisingly, we found that the heavy tyrosine catabolites that accumulate in vivo do not match the compounds that rescue yeast when supplemented. Further work will be required to fully resolve this paradox, but it is possible that the compounds that accumulate at steady state are simply “waste” or “cul-de-sac” products. This notion is consistent with the putative roles of tyrosol and 4-HPA as Ehrlich pathway end products (16Hazelwood L.A. Daran J.M. van Maris A.J. Pronk J.T. Dickinson J.R. The Ehrlich pathway for fusel alcohol production: A century of research on Saccharomyces cerevisiae metabolism.Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2008; 74: 2259-2266Crossref PubMed Scopus (769) Google Scholar) and our hypothesis that 4-HPL exists in a separate equilibrium with 4-HPP. Regardless, assigning intermediates to this pathway with certainty will require additional genetic or biochemical evidence. S. cerevisiae underwent an ancient whole-genome duplication (WGD) event that resulted in >1000 paralogous genes, contributing to genetic robustness (32Gordon J.L. Byrne K.P. Wolfe K.H.

https://openalex.org/W3153893253,"Introduction Technologies provide a brilliant opportunity to promote social-emotional competences, well-being and adjustment in adolescence. Game-based programmes and serious games are digital tools that pursue an educational goal in an attractive environment for adolescents. The purpose of this study was therefore to determine the effectiveness of emoTIC , a game-based social-emotional programme designed according to Mayer, Caruso, and Salovey’s model of emotional intelligence. Materials and methods The participants were 119 adolescents between 11 and 15 years, randomly assigned to the experimental group and the control group. The adolescents completed questionnaires to assess their emotional intelligence, self-esteem, affect balance, difficulties, prosocial behaviour, depression, anxiety and stress. Results The MANCOVA results showed that adolescents who completed the game-based programme had improved self-esteem, affect balance, emotional symptoms, behavioural problems, and hyperactivity (Wilks’ λ = .77; F = 2.10; p = .035). Hierarchical multiple regression indicated that adolescents in the experimental group had a greater change in self-esteem and affect balance (positive β), while their emotional problems and hyperactivity decreased (negative β). Anxiety moderated the influence of the intervention on self-esteem ( b = .04; t = -2.55; p ≤ .05; LLCI = -0.43, ULCI = -0.05). Adolescents with low or medium anxiety improved their self-esteem with the intervention, while those with high anxiety did not develop it.

https://openalex.org/W3154208200,"Fire blight is a destructive plant disease caused by Erwinia amylovora affecting pome fruit trees, and responsible for large yield declines, long phytosanitary confinements, and high economic losses. In Portugal, the first major fire blight outbreaks occurred in 2010 and 2011, and although later considered eradicated, the emergence of other outbreaks in recent years stressed the need to characterize the E . amylovora populations associated with these outbreaks. In this regard, CRISPR genotyping, assessment of three virulence markers, and semi-quantitative virulence bioassays, were carried out to determine the genotype, and assess the virulence of thirty-six E . amylovora isolates associated with outbreaks occurring between 2010 and 2017 and affecting apple and pear orchards located in the country central-west, known as the main producing region of pome fruits in Portugal. The data gathered reveal that 35 E . amylovora isolates belong to one of the widely-distributed CRISPR genotypes (5-24-38 / D-a-α) regardless the host species, year and region. Ea 680 was the single isolate revealing a new CRISPR genotype due to a novel CR2 spacer located closer to the leader sequence and therefore thought to be recently acquired. Regarding pathogenicity, although dot-blot hybridization assays showed the presence of key virulence factors, namely hrpL (T3SS), hrpN (T3E) and amsG from the amylovoran biosynthesis operon in all E . amylovora isolates studied, pathogenicity bioassays on immature pear slices allowed to distinguish four virulence levels, with most of the isolates revealing an intermediate to severe virulence phenotype. Regardless the clonal population structure of the E . amylovora associated to the outbreaks occurring in Portugal between 2010 and 2017, the different virulence phenotypes, suggests that E . amylovora may have been introduced at different instances into the country. This is the first study regarding E . amylovora in Portugal, and it discloses a novel CRISPR genotype for this bacterium."
https://openalex.org/W3155274146,"α-synuclein (αSyn) is a protein known to form intracellular aggregates during the manifestation of Parkinson’s disease. Previously, it was shown that αSyn aggregation was strongly suppressed in the midbrain region of mice that did not possess the gene encoding the lipid transport protein fatty acid binding protein 3 (FABP3). An interaction between these two proteins was detected in vitro, suggesting that FABP3 may play a role in the aggregation and deposition of αSyn in neurons. To characterize the molecular mechanisms that underlie the interactions between FABP3 and αSyn that modulate the cellular accumulation of the latter, in this report, we used in vitro fluorescence assays combined with fluorescence microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, and quartz crystal microbalance assays to characterize in detail the process and consequences of FABP3–αSyn interaction. We demonstrated that binding of FABP3 to αSyn results in changes in the aggregation mechanism of the latter; specifically, a suppression of fibrillar forms of αSyn and also the production of aggregates with an enhanced cytotoxicity toward mice neuro2A cells. Because this interaction involved the C-terminal sequence region of αSyn, we tested a peptide derived from this region of αSyn (αSynP130-140) as a decoy to prevent the FABP3–αSyn interaction. We observed that the peptide competitively inhibited binding of αSyn to FABP3 in vitro and in cultured cells. We propose that administration of αSynP130-140 might be used to prevent the accumulation of toxic FABP3-αSyn oligomers in cells, thereby preventing the progression of Parkinson’s disease. α-synuclein (αSyn) is a protein known to form intracellular aggregates during the manifestation of Parkinson’s disease.

A pathological hallmark of Parkinson’s disease (PD) is the aggregation/deposition of insoluble protein in the cell known as Lewy bodies (1Spillantini M.G. Crowther R.A. Jakes R. Hasegawa M. Goedert M. alpha-Synuclein in filamentous inclusions of Lewy bodies from Parkinson's disease and dementia with Lewy bodies.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The main protein component of Lewy bodies is α-synuclein (αSyn), an intrinsically unfolded polypeptide composed of 140 amino acid residues, that is highly expressed in neurons. The amino acid sequence of αSyn is distinguished by three characteristic domains: an amphiphilic N-terminal domain (amino acid residue number; 1–65) enriched in positively charged lysine residues (3Weinreb P.H. Zhen W. Poon A.W. Conway K.A. Lansbury Jr., P.T. NACP, a protein implicated in Alzheimer's disease and learning, is natively unfolded.Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 13709-13715Crossref PubMed Scopus (1202) Google Scholar), a central domain (the NAC domain; 66–95) which contains many hydrophobic amino acid residues, and a negatively charged C-terminal domain (96–140) (4Okochi M.

Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11282-11286Crossref PubMed Scopus (1125) Google Scholar). In in vitro experiments, αSyn has been shown to form regular, β-sheet–enriched filamentous aggregates that specifically bind to the fluorescent dye Thioflavin-T (Thio-T) (6Spillantini M.G.

Numerous extensive studies have shown that during the pathological progression of PD, aggregates formed by αSyn display cytotoxicity. Detailed experiments have demonstrated that the specific form of aggregated αSyn that is most toxic to cells is a soluble, oligomeric form that is formed before the maturation of higher order, insoluble fibrils that are eventually detected in pathological screens (7Winner B.

Biochem. 2017; 161: 55-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). In this context, the Lewy bodies that are detected as a hallmark of PD may be regarded as an evolved method to “isolate and contain” cytotoxic soluble oligomers. Details regarding the specific correlation between cellular toxicity and various forms of αSyn are still unclear, however, especially when the highly heterogeneous environment within typical eukaryotic cells are likely to alter various factors of this relationship. Previously, it was found that polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) are capable of binding to αSyn and accelerating the oligomerization of this protein (11Sharon R. Bar-Joseph I. Frosch M.P. Walsh D.M. Hamilton J.A. Selkoe D.J. The formation of highly soluble oligomers of alpha-synuclein is regulated by fatty acids and enhanced in Parkinson's disease.Neuron. 2003; 37: 583-595Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). The N-terminal region of αSyn was implicated in this interaction with PUFAs (12Karube H. Sakamoto M. Arawaka S. Hara S. Sato H. Ren C.H. Goto S. Koyama S. Wada M. Kawanami T. Kurita K. Kato T. N-terminal region of alpha-synuclein is essential for the fatty acid-induced oligomerization of the molecules.FEBS Lett. 2008; 582: 3693-3700Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). This interaction between αSyn and PUFAs may also be biologically relevant, because PUFAs bound to αSyn were transported into cells (13Sharon R. Goldberg M.S. Bar-Josef I. Betensky R.A. Shen J. Selkoe D.J. alpha-Synuclein occurs in lipid-rich high molecular weight complexes, binds fatty acids, and shows homology to the fatty acid-binding proteins.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 2003; 278: 49874-49881Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Typically, the import of fatty acid and PUFAs into the cell is mediated by a small group of transport proteins known as the fatty acid binding proteins (FABPs) (15Glatz J.F. Vork M.M. Cistola D.P. van der Vusse G.J.

Fatty Acids. 1993; 48: 33-41Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). In mammals, ten FABP subtypes have been characterized (16Chmurzyńska A. The multigene family of fatty acid-binding proteins (FABPs): Function, structure and polymorphism.J. Appl. Genet. 2006; 47: 39-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar, 17Liu R.Z. Li X.

A novel fatty acid-binding protein (FABP) gene resulting from tandem gene duplication in mammals: Transcription in rat retina and testis.Genomics. 2008; 92: 436-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) and are generally grouped according to the degree of protein expression in various organs and cell types, although more detailed characterizations have confirmed the expression of certain FABPs in multiple locales (18Yamamoto T. Yamamoto A. Watanabe M. Matsuo T. Yamazaki N. Kataoka M. Terada H. Shinohara Y. Classification of FABP isoforms and tissues based on quantitative evaluation of transcript levels of these isoforms in various rat tissues.Biotechnol. Lett. 2009; 31: 1695-1701Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The sequence homology between FABP subtypes ranges between 20 and 70%; however, the family is characterized by a common tertiary structural motif which consists of a central β-barrel structure composed of ten β-strands and two α-helices in the N-terminal portion. Fatty acid molecules are recognized and bound by the β-barrel motif. Each FABP subtype shows binding preferences toward different fatty acids; cardiac H-FABP (FABP3) preferentially binds n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids, epidermal E-FABP (FABP5) recognizes saturated fatty acids, and brain B-FABP (FABP7) recognizes n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids such as α-linolenic acid, docosahexaenoic acid, and eicosapentaenoic acid (19Hanhoff T. Lücke C. Spener F. Insights into binding of fatty acids by fatty acid binding proteins.Mol. Cell. Biochem. 2002; 239: 45-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). In brain tissue, all three of these FABP subtypes are expressed (20Owada Y. Yoshimoto T. Kondo H.

Biol. 2010; 54: 1229-1239Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Experiments have shown that serum levels of FABP3 were significantly higher in patients of dementia with Lewy bodies and PD compared with the levels in Alzheimer's disease patients (22Wada-Isoe K.

Sci. 2008; 266: 20-24Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The structure of FABP3 is characterized by a β-barrel structure within which a cluster of water molecules reside. This cluster of water molecules acts as an interface to bind various PUFA molecules, in cooperation with numerous hydrophobic amino acid side chains. FABP3 is also capable of binding to various hydrophobic molecules via these amino acid side chains. An amphipathic fluorescence probe, 1-anilino-8-napthalene sulfonate (ANS), has also been utilized to detect PUFA binding to FABP3 (23Matsuoka S. Sugiyama S. Matsuoka D. Hirose M. Lethu S. Ano H.

Synchrotron Radiat. 2013; 20: 923-928Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Interestingly, when mice lacking the FABP3 gene were subjected to treatment with 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine to induce PD-like symptoms, cells sampled from midbrain lacked the characteristic accumulation of αSyn that could typically be observed in WT mice. This finding suggested the existence of a strong relationship between αSyn aggregation and FABP3 (26Shioda N. Yabuki Y. Kobayashi Y. Onozato M. Owada Y. Fukunaga K. FABP3 protein promotes alpha-synuclein oligomerization associated with 1-methyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropiridine-induced neurotoxicity.J. Biol. Chem. 2014; 289: 18957-18965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), specifically, a preventive effect by FABP3 toward αSyn aggregation. To confirm this relationship between an intrinsically unfolded polypeptide and a fatty acid binding protein, in this article, we report our results of our experiments regarding the interactions between αSyn and FABP3. We confirm that αSyn indeed interacts specifically with the apo form of FABP3, and this interaction causes changes in the fibrillation behavior of the former polypeptide. Furthermore, our experiments revealed that αSyn and FABP3 interactions are also present in cultured cells, as monitored by fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) experiments, and that this interaction results in an increase in cytotoxicity. We also succeeded in identifying the specific site in αSyn that is required for this interaction and, by using this information, propose a method to control this interaction to neutralize the deleterious effects of FABP3. A previous study has demonstrated that in mammalian cells, co-expression of FABP3 and αSyn results in increased intracellular aggregation of the latter (26Shioda N. Yabuki Y. Kobayashi Y. Onozato M. Owada Y. Fukunaga K. FABP3 protein promotes alpha-synuclein oligomerization associated with 1-methyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropiridine-induced neurotoxicity.J. Biol. Chem. 2014; 289: 18957-18965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). To clarify the relationship between these two proteins, we show in Figure 1 in vitro fibril-forming reactions of αSyn that compare the effects of adding FABP3 to the experiment. In the absence of FABP3, αSyn formed amyloid fibrils after an initial lag phase under standard agitating conditions as monitored with Thio-T (Fig. 1A). These fibrils could be observed in transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images as regular twisted fibrils that were about 10∼20 nm in width (Fig. 1B). Addition of increasing amounts of FABP3 to the reaction caused a gradual elongation of the initial lag phase, as well as a decrease in the cumulative Thio-T signal at the end of the assay (Fig. 1A), signifying a decrease in the amount of fibrils formed during the experiment. As shown in Figure 1B, TEM images of these reactions showed that at higher FABP3 concentrations, it became increasingly more difficult to obtain images of fibrillar material. A closer look suggests that the fibril forms that were observed in experimental samples containing higher concentrations of FABP3 were also slightly different in form and tended toward shorter fibers. The addition of FABP3 served to suppress the formation of αSyn fibrillar structures that would be normally formed under the conditions that we used, presumably through direct interaction with αSyn. Importantly, no significant suppressive effects in fibrillation of αSyn were observed when FABP3 (pI 7.8) was replaced with bovine serum albumin (pI 4.7) or lysozyme (pI 9.8). Next, we performed delayed-addition experiments of FABP3 to αSyn to determine if there was a threshold to the time frame in which FABP3 could assert its suppressive effects toward αSyn fibrillation. As shown in Figure 1C, adding FABP3 to the mixture during the initial lag phase of fibrillation resulted in effective suppression of the Thio-T signal, whereas adding FABP3 during the extension phase of the reaction resulted in only partial suppression. Interestingly, the addition of FABP3 during the fibril extension phase initially resulted in a strong suppression of further fibril formation, but this effect was eventually overcome; the increase in fluorescence signal at the end of the assay was equal to the signal seen in the absence of FABP3 (Fig. 1C, compare blue and green traces at t = 1800 min). This indicated that the effects of FABP3 on αSyn fibrillation became gradually weaker as the reaction progressed, and once extensive formation of fibrils had begun, the suppressive effects of FABP3 were eventually superseded by the tendency of αSyn to form fibrils. Adding FABP3 at the end of the reaction caused minimal change to the Thio-T fluorescence signal, suggesting that FABP3 is incapable of resolubilizing αSyn fibrils once they have formed. These effects of FABP3 were also reflected in the morphology of fibrils formed under these various conditions. As shown in Figure 1D, when FABP3 was added during the lag phase (t ≦ 180 min), the fibrils formed were shorter in morphology and more sparsely dispersed in the TEM observation field. In contrast, for samples where FABP3 was added in the latter portion of the reaction, there were no detectable differences in the width and height of the fibrils observed in the TEM and atomic force microscopy (AFM) images (Table 1). αSyn, α-synuclein; AFM, atomic force microscopy; FABP3, fatty acid binding protein 3. Building upon the results that indicated a reduced fibrillation of αSyn in the presence of FABP3 in Figure 1, we next probed for details regarding the structural and functional consequences of αSyn–FABP3 binding that result in the suppression of αSyn fibrils. In Figure 2A, we compare the circular dichroism (CD) spectra of αSyn samples allowed to form fibrils in the absence and presence of an equimolar concentration of FABP3. Because FABP3 was characterized by a strong negative CD absorbance in the far UV region that reflects its secondary structural composition, the comparisons for αSyn structure must be performed after the contribution of FABP3 to the overall spectra are subtracted. As shown in Figure 2A (left), in the absence of FABP3, the CD spectra of αSyn is reflective of a structural transition between an intrinsically disordered protein (the original state of αSyn) and a β-structure-rich fibril state with a negative CD absorption maximum at around 218 nm (Fig. 2A [left], “αSyn”, compare black and blue traces). In the presence of equimolar FABP3 (Fig. 2A [right]); however, this transition was not immediately apparent; comparison of the CD spectra after the FABP3 component has been subtracted indicated that the CD signal of αSyn remained largely unchanged for the duration of the fibril extension experiment, suggesting that the presence of FABP3 served to maintain αSyn in its largely disordered state (Fig. 2A (right), “αSyn; (αSyn+FABP3)-FABP3”). These findings were also supported by analysis of these results using BeStSel (27Micsonai A. Wien F. Bulyaki E. Kun J. Moussong E. Lee Y.H. Goto Y. Refregiers M. Kardos J. BeStSel: A web server for accurate protein secondary structure prediction and fold recognition from the circular dichroism spectra.Nucleic Acids Res. 2018; 46: W315-W322Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar), as summarized in Table 2. αSyn, α-synuclein; CD, circular dichroism; FABP3, fatty acid binding protein 3. The binding of FABP3 to αSyn also resulted in a measurable decrease in the size of aggregates that were formed during the fibril forming reaction, as shown in Figure 2B. Dynamic light scattering analysis showed that while αSyn alone formed particles (fibrils) with an average particle size of 6 μm in the absence of FABP3 after a 1200 min incubation, in the presence of FABP3, the average size of the particles decreased to almost 1/10 of this value to 0.63 μm. This value, which was greater than the average particle size (50 nm) for FABP3 alone during an equivalent incubation, suggested that the binding of FABP3 to αSyn was successful in suppressing the large aggregates (fibrils) that the latter protein would tend to form under similar conditions. The effects of FABP3 on αSyn fibrillation seemed to bind and form a stable complex that would prevent the formation of larger oligomers that would eventually lead to insoluble fibrils. In an accompanying experiment, we demonstrated that the interaction between αSyn and FABP3 also results in changes in the surface hydrophobicity of FABP3 as well. In Figure 2C, we show changes in the ANS fluorescence spectra of FABP3 samples incubated in the presence of increasing concentrations of αSyn (25Hirose M. Sugiyama S. Ishida H. Niiyama M. Matsuoka D. Hara T. Mizohata E. Murakami S. Inoue T. Matsuoka S. Murata M. Structure of the human-heart fatty-acid-binding protein 3 in complex with the fluorescent probe 1-anilinonaphthalene-8-sulphonic acid.J. Synchrotron Radiat. 2013; 20: 923-928Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). As shown in the figure, addition of increasing concentrations of αSyn to FABP3 results in the gradual decrease of ANS-derived fluorescence. As shown in the inset to Figure 2C, the decrease in fluorescence signal was retarded abruptly when more than a 1:1 concentration of αSyn was added to FABP3 samples, which suggested that these two proteins were binding stoichiometrically under these conditions. The time course of this decrease in fluorescence revealed additional insights. As visualized in Figure 2D, when we monitored the changes in ANS-derived fluorescence of αSyn–FABP3 complexes over a period of 20 h, we observed that the decrease in ANS fluorescence (attributed to a decrease in the surface hydrophobicity of FABP3 being occluded by the binding of αSyn) proceeded gradually over this time period. This additional insight suggested that, once formed, the αSyn–FABP3 complex matured into a different soluble form characterized as shown in Figure 2B (""αSyn+FABP3"" at 1200 min), one with a decreased hydrophobic surface area and a slightly larger size. This insight was an additional hint to the potential consequences that such a conformational change may pose to the cellular function of these two proteins. Do the complexes formed by αSyn and FABP3 display toxicity toward cells? To answer this question, we performed cell toxicity assays by adding various fractions of αSyn sampled during the course of fibrillation to mammalian cell cultures. The toxicity of aggregated αSyn species is typically highest for the so-called “oligomeric” forms that are most abundant immediately before the extension phase of the reaction (7Winner B. Jappelli R.

Biochem. 2017; 161: 55-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar); the results in Figure 2E, “-FABP3”, support this prior finding. Interestingly, a stronger toxicity was observed for the ""αSyn + FABP3"" sample at 5 to 6 h compared with αSyn only (Fig. 2E, compare “+FABP3” and “-FABP3”). This result suggested that the binding of FABP3 to αSyn does result in the formation of alternate oligomeric forms with stronger cellular toxicities. Formation of the αSyn–FABP3 complex results in a suppression of the mature fibril form of αSyn, possibly through diversion of αSyn–FABP3 complex to an alternate form with higher toxicity. To observe the details of the oligomeric structures, we measured TEM images for αSyn and αSyn–FABP3 complex samples incubated for various intervals (Fig. 2F). As shown in Figure 2F, we observed small aggregates that were 50 to 80 nm in diameter in samples of αSyn incubated singly for 5.5 h and samples of αSyn–FABP3 incubated for 3 and 5.5 h, respectively. Additionally, in the images of αSyn–FABP3 complex incubated for 5.5 h, we observed larger sized oligomers 80 to 150 nm in diameter, which may also correspond to toxic species of αSyn–FABP3 complex. To summarize, αSyn and FABP3 form a αSyn–FABP3 complex in vitro at a 1:1 molar ratio, and this complex effectively prevents αSyn fibrillation. Over time, this complex transiently formed a soluble cytotoxic species [(αSyn-FABP3)n oligomer] in vitro. We next probed for information regarding the actual binding interactions between αSyn and FABP3, beginning with the determination of the specific sequence region of αSyn that was most directly involved in intermolecular interactions. To achieve this, we prepared three forms of αSyn with specific sequence alterations to the C-terminal sequence region (from residues 130 to 140) of αSyn, because this region has previously been implicated in the formation of αSyn fibrils (28Izawa Y.

In the αSyn130-140CF (Charge-Free) variant (130CF), all of the charged sequences in this sequence segment (130-EEGYQDYEPEA-140, bolded) were substituted with polar, noncharged asparagine residues. In the αSynY133A/Y136A variant (YA/YA), two hydrophobic and aromatic tyrosine residues in this region were substituted with neutral alanine residues. The three variants comprise a survey of the general importance of sequence locale, hydrophilicity, and hydrophobicity with regard to this sequence segment by selectively altering each of these possible contributing factors. Figure 3 and Table 3 show the results of this survey. As shown in Figure 3A, we found that the C-terminal sequence region of αSyn was indeed integral to the interaction between this protein and FABP3, as the truncated variant Δ130 became clearly unresponsive to FABP3 addition and retained its tendency to form fibrils. A similar result was also obtained using the truncated αSynΔ120-140 variant. This demonstrates that the C-terminal amino acid residues spanning 130 to 140 of the αSyn amino acid sequence is necessary for αSyn binding to FABP3.

Although it has recently been reported that the establishment of an immunosuppressive microenvironment in oral potentially malignant disorders may lead to malignant transformation, it is unclear whether the microenvironments of oral potentially malignant disorders differ according to smoking status. We examined differences in programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression and subepithelial CD163+ TAM and CD8+ cell/lymphocyte counts in the microenvironment of oral leukoplakia of smoking and non-smoking patients and investigated their associations with malignant transformation. Pathology reports and original biopsy request forms from 1995–2015 were retrospectively reviewed. Lesions clinically characterized as white plaques/lesions of the oral mucosa and pathologically diagnosed as oral epithelial dysplasia were included. Immunohistochemistry was performed to evaluate PD-L1 expression and subepithelial CD163+/CD8+ cell counts. The significance of prognostic factors in predicting malignant transformation was determined using Cox regression analysis. Statistical significance was defined as P&lt;0.05. In total, 200 patients with oral leukoplakia were selected. The mean age at diagnosis was higher in non-smoking patients (n = 141; 66.9 years) than in smoking patients (n = 59; 60.5 years). The 5-year cumulative malignant transformation rate was higher in non-smoking patients than in smoking patients (9.3% vs. 3.0%, respectively). Oral leukoplakia was associated with significantly higher PD-L1 expression and increased numbers of subepithelial CD163+ cells in the non-smoking group compared with the smoking group. Non-smoking-related oral leukoplakia with positive PD-L1 expression was associated with a 6.97-fold (95% confidence interval: 2.14–22.7) increased risk of malignant transformation. The microenvironment of oral leukoplakia differed according to smoking status. A combination of smoking status and PD-L1 expression may predict malignant transformation in oral leukoplakia patients. This study highlights the importance of understanding the interaction between smoking and the microenvironment in oral leukoplakia."
https://openalex.org/W3154199660,"Objectives The aim of the study was to assess the influence of different factors, including treatment, on the risk of ILD in the course of RA. Methods A total of 109 RA patients were included in the analysis. High-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) of chest was obtained in each patient. Patients were classified as having ILD (ILD group) or not (N-ILD group). The ILD was graded using the semi-quantitative Warrick scale of fibrosis. Warrick extent score (WES) and Warrick severity score (WSS) were calculated separately for each patient, then combined to obtain a global score (WGS). Results In univariate analysis the presence of ILD was associated positively with age ( P = 5x10 -6 ) and negatively with MTX treatment ( P = 0.0013), mean MTX dose per year of treatment ( P = 0.003) and number of DMARDs used ( P = 0.046). On multivariate analysis only age and treatment with MTX were independently associated with the presence of ILD. WGS was significantly lower in patients treated with MTX in a dose of ≥15 mg/week (MTX≥15 group) as compared to patients treated with lower doses of MTX (0&lt;MTX&lt;15 group) or not treated with MTX (N-MTX group) ( P = 0.04 and P = 0.037, respectively). The ILD prevalence was higher in N-MTX group than in 0&lt;MTX&lt;15 group ( P = 0.0036) and MTX≥15 group (0.0007). The difference in ILD prevalence between MTX≥15 and 0&lt;MTX&lt;15 groups was not significant, but the latter group had higher WES ( P = 0.044) and trended to have higher WSS and WGS. Consclusions We found a beneficial effect of MTX on RA-ILD. Importantly, this effect seems to be dose dependent."
https://openalex.org/W3154768080,"Methamphetamine (METH) is a synthetic drug with severe neurotoxicity, however, the regulation of METH-induced neuronal programmed necrosis remains poorly understood. The aim of this study was to identify the molecular mechanisms of METH-induced neuronal programmed necrosis. We found that neuronal programmed necrosis occurred in the striatum of brain samples from human and mice that were exposed to METH. The receptor-interacting protein kinase 3 (RIP3) was highly expressed in the neurons of human and mice exposed to METH, and RIP3-silenced or RIP1-inhibited protected neurons developed neuronal programmed necrosis in vitro and in vivo following METH exposure. Moreover, the RIP1-RIP3 complex causes cell programmed necrosis by regulating mixed lineage kinase domain-like protein (MLKL)-mediated cell membrane rupture and dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1)-mediated mitochondrial fission. Together, these data indicate that RIP3 plays an indispensable role in the mechanism of METH-induced neuronal programmed necrosis, which may represent a potential therapeutic target for METH-induced neurotoxicity."
https://openalex.org/W3152582737,"With current trends in cannabis legalization, large efforts are being made to understand the effects of less restricted legislation on human consumption, health, and abuse of these products. Little is known about the effects of cannabis legalization and increased cannabis use on vulnerable populations, such as dogs. The objective of this study was to examine the effects of different state-level cannabis legislation, county-level socioeconomic factors, and dog-level characteristics on dog cannabis poisoning reports to an animal poison control center (APCC). Data were obtained concerning reports of dog poisoning events, county characteristics, and state cannabis legislation from the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals’ (ASPCA) APCC, the US Census Bureau, and various public policy-oriented and government websites, respectively. A multilevel logistic regression model with random intercepts for county and state was fitted to investigate the associations between the odds of a call to the APCC being related to a dog being poisoned by a cannabis product and the following types of variables: dog characteristics, county-level socioeconomic characteristics, and the type of state-level cannabis legislation. There were significantly higher odds of a call being related to cannabis in states with lower penalties for cannabis use and possession. The odds of these calls were higher in counties with higher income variability, higher percentage of urban population, and among smaller, male, and intact dogs. These calls increased throughout the study period (2009–2014). Reporting of cannabis poisonings were more likely to come from veterinarians than dog owners. Reported dog poisonings due to cannabis appear to be influenced by dog-level and community-level factors. This study may increase awareness to the public, public health, and veterinary communities of the effects of recreational drug use on dog populations. This study highlights the need to educate dog owners about safeguarding cannabis products from vulnerable populations."
https://openalex.org/W3152965137,"Liver fibrosis is a common feature of liver dysfunction during chronic liver diseases and is frequently associated with angiogenesis, a dynamic process that forms new blood vessels from preexisting vasculature. MicroRNAs (miRNAs), which act as posttranscriptional regulators of gene expression, have been shown to regulate liver fibrosis; however, how miRNAs regulate angiogenesis and its mechanism in fibrosis are not well understood. We aimed to elucidate the role and mechanism of miR-30c in attenuating liver fibrosis. Using miRNA profiling of fibrotic murine livers, we identified differentially regulated miRNAs and discovered that miR-30c is aberrantly expressed and targets endothelial delta-like ligand 4 (DLL4) in either carbon tetrachloride-treated or bile duct ligated fibrotic mice, as well as in patients with liver fibrosis. Using CCK-8, wound healing and Matrigel tube formation assays, we found that miR-30c inhibited liver sinusoidal endothelial cell (LSEC) proliferation, migration, and angiogenesis capacity by targeting DLL4 in vitro. Importantly, nanoparticle-based delivery of miR-30c to LSECs inhibited the DLL4/Notch pathway and angiogenesis, thereby ameliorating liver fibrosis in vivo. Collectively, our findings demonstrate a protective role of miR-30c in liver fibrosis by regulating DLL4/Notch signaling and angiogenesis. Thus, miR-30c may serve as a potential treatment for chronic liver diseases."
https://openalex.org/W3153032775,"Aberrant accumulation of amyloid-β (Aβ) in brain is the major trigger for pathogenesis in Alzheimer's disease (AD). It is imperative to understand how Aβ attains such toxic levels in the brain parenchyma. We detected that a subtle and tolerable amount of DNA damage, related to aging, increased intraneuronal Aβ1-42 production both in cultured neuron and in cortex of rodent brain. Strikingly, we also observed elevated levels of mitochondrial fusion and of its major driver protein, MFN2. Hyperfusion of mitochondria may be seen as an adaptive stress response resulting from the induction of ER stress since we detected the activation of both PERK and IRE1α arms of unfolded protein response of ER stress. We found increased phosphorylation of PERK substrate eukaryotic initiation factor 2 α (eIF2α), and upregulation of the downstream effector proteins, ATF4 and CHOP. Concomitantly, increased XBP1 level, the direct effecter protein of IRE-1α, was observed. Reports suggest that eIF2α phosphorylation can increase BACE1 activity, the rate limiting enzyme in Aβ production. Here, we show that inhibiting PERK, decreased Aβ1-42 level while direct BACE1 inhibition, reduced the mitochondrial fusion. We found increased MFN2 expression in young 5xFAD mice when Aβ plaques and neurodegeneration were absent. Thus, our study indicates that mild DNA damage leads to increased Aβ1-42 production almost as a consequence of an initial ER stress-directed protective mitochondrial fusion in brain. We propose that an age-related subtle genomic DNA damage may trigger enhanced intraneuronal Aβ1-42 production in an apparently healthy neuron way before the appearance of clinical symptoms in AD."
https://openalex.org/W3155192127,"Exogenous hydrogen sulfide (H2 S) protects kidneys from diabetic injuries in animal models. In order to explore the role of endogenous H2 S in diabetic nephropathy, we determined the renal H2S producing enzymes in vivo and in vitro. In diabetic mice, H2 S levels in blood and kidney were decreased while cystathionine β-synthase (CBS), mainly located in mouse renal proximal convoluted tubules (PCT), was reduced selectively. In cultured mouse PCT cells treated with high glucose, CBS protein and activity was reduced while ubiquitinated CBS was increased, which was abolished by a proteasome inhibitor MG132 at 1 hour; high glucose drove CBS colocalized with proteasome 26S subunit ATPase6, indicating an involvement of ubiquitination proteasome degradation. At 48 hours, high glucose also selectively decreased CBS protein, concentration-dependently, but increased the ubiquitination of CBS; silence of CBS by siRNA increased nitrotyrosine, a marker for protein oxidative injury. Nitrotyrosine was also increased by high glucose treatments. The increases of nitrotyrosine either by cbs-siRNA or by glucose were restored by GYY4137, indicating that the H2 S donor may protect kidney from oxidative injury induced by CBS deficiency. In diabetic kidneys, ubiquitinated CBS and nitrotyrosine were increased but restored by GYY4137. The treatment also ameliorated albuminuria and renal morphologic changes in diabetic mice. Our findings suggest that high glucose induces reduction of renal CBS protein and activity in vivo and in vitro that is critical to the pathogenesis of diabetic kidney disease."
https://openalex.org/W3156069634,"Background Skin conditions are the fourth leading cause of nonfatal disease globally, with atopic dermatitis (AD) a major and rising contributor. Though atopic dermatitis (AD) is rising in prevalence, little is known about its psychosocial effects on children and families in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Methods We conducted a community-based, cross-sectional survey of 2242 under-5 children in rural Bangladesh using the International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood (ISAAC) questionnaire to measure AD prevalence and severity, the Patient-Oriented Eczema Measure (POEM) to measure severity, and the Infants’ Dermatitis Quality of Life index (IDQoL) and Dermatitis Family Index (DFI) to measure quality of life. Findings Overall AD prevalence in under-five children was 11.9% [95% confidence interval (CI) 10.6–13.3%]. Prevalence was highest in children age 30–35 months [16.2% (95% CI 11.4–21.0)]. IDQoL was significantly higher in males (2.67) vs. females (1.95, p = 0.015), the lowest (3.06) vs. highest (1.63) wealth quintile (p&lt;0.001), and among mothers with &lt; primary (2.41) vs. &gt; secondary (1.43) education (p = 0.039). POEM severity was correlated with IDQoL (r = 0.77, p&lt;0.001) and DFI (r = 0.56, p&lt;0.001). Severe disease as rated by caretakers was correlated with POEM (r = 0.73, p&lt;0.001), IDQoL (r = 0.82, p&lt;0.001) and DFI (r = 0.57, p&lt;0.001). Conclusions Severe AD significantly affects quality of life for children and families in Bangladesh. As access to healthcare expands in LMICs, identification and treatment of both the medical and psychosocial morbidities associated with the disease are needed."

The model captures ecosystem services trade-offs between cage farming and native fish loss. It is used to appraise options for lake management related to the minimization of the impacts of the cage farms. The constructed model overcomes difficulties with limited data availability to illustrate the complex physical and biogeochemical interactions contributing to triggering mass fish kills due to upwelling and the loss in the production of native fish related to the operation of cage farming. The model highlights existing information gaps in the research related to the management of the farms in the study area, which is applicable to other tropical lakes in general. Model results suggest that internal phosphorous loading (IPL) should be recognized as one of the primary targets of the deep eutrophic tropical lake restoration efforts. Theoretical and practical contributions of the model and model expansions are discussed. Short- and longer-term actions to contribute to a more sustainable management are recommended and include epilimnion aeration and sediment capping."
https://openalex.org/W3152695843,"Current methods for detection of mycotoxin in feed are time-consuming and tedious. An up-converting phosphor technology-based lateral flow (UPT-LF) assay system is a new emerging technique for analytes detection. The aim of this study was to compare the performance of UPT-LF, an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS) for detecting aflatoxin B 1 (AFB 1 ), zearalenone (ZEN) and deoxynivalenol (DON) in feed. The results showed that the use of UPT-LF for AFB 1 , ZEN and DON detection exhibited the following: limits of detection of 3, 50 and 200 μg/kg; average recoveries of 104.39%, 102.94% and 103.65%; and precision of 13.96%, 13.71% and 12.56%; respectively. UPT-LF required 45 min to determine one mycotoxin and 1.5 h to determine three mycotoxins in a sample, which took the shortest time. Besides, there were positive correlations between the UPT-LF, ELISA and HPLC/MS/MS methods. In conclusion, UPT-LF can be used to detect and quantify AFB 1 , ZEN and DON in feed samples. Though the sensitivity, accuracy and precision of UPT-LF are inferior to those of HPLC-MS/MS and ELISA, the UPT-LF assay is the most convenient and rapid technique for on-site detection among the three methods."
https://openalex.org/W3152860408,"Research has repeatedly shown that familiar and unfamiliar voices elicit different neural responses. But it has also been suggested that different neural correlates associate with the feeling of having heard a voice and knowing who the voice represents. The terminology used to designate these varying responses remains vague, creating a degree of confusion in the literature. Additionally, terms serving to designate tasks of voice discrimination, voice recognition, and speaker identification are often inconsistent creating further ambiguities. The present study used event-related potentials (ERPs) to clarify the difference between responses to 1) unknown voices, 2) trained-to-familiar voices as speech stimuli are repeatedly presented, and 3) intimately familiar voices. In an experiment, 13 participants listened to repeated utterances recorded from 12 speakers. Only one of the 12 voices was intimately familiar to a participant, whereas the remaining 11 voices were unfamiliar. The frequency of presentation of these 11 unfamiliar voices varied with only one being frequently presented (the trained-to-familiar voice). ERP analyses revealed different responses for intimately familiar and unfamiliar voices in two distinct time windows (P2 between 200–250 ms and a late positive component, LPC, between 450–850 ms post-onset) with late responses occurring only for intimately familiar voices. The LPC present sustained shifts, and short-time ERP components appear to reflect an early recognition stage. The trained voice equally elicited distinct responses, compared to rarely heard voices, but these occurred in a third time window (N250 between 300–350 ms post-onset). Overall, the timing of responses suggests that the processing of intimately familiar voices operates in two distinct steps of voice recognition, marked by a P2 on right centro-frontal sites, and speaker identification marked by an LPC component. The recognition of frequently heard voices entails an independent recognition process marked by a differential N250. Based on the present results and previous observations, it is proposed that there is a need to distinguish between processes of voice “recognition” and “identification”. The present study also specifies test conditions serving to reveal this distinction in neural responses, one of which bears on the length of speech stimuli given the late responses associated with voice identification."
https://openalex.org/W3153313509,"Patients with systemic lupus erythematosus are at increased risk for alveolar bone loss due to periodontitis possibly as a result of a pathogenic immune response to oral bacteria and inflammation. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether an anti-TNF-α antagonist could prevent mandibular bone loss in the FcγRIIb -/- mouse model of lupus. Mice lacking FcγRIIb had decreased cancellous and cortical bone volume at 6 months of age. Etanercept increased cancellous but not cortical bone volume in WT and increased both cancellous bone volume and cortical thickness in FcγRIIb- deficient mice. FcγRIIb deficiency decreased mRNA levels for osteoblast marker genes, Osx , Col1a1 and Alp without any change in osteoclast marker genes. Etanercept increased Osx , Alp , and Ocn in both WT and FcγRIIb -/- mice. Osteoclast marker genes including TNF- α, Trap and RANKL/OPG ratio was decreased in WT. Serum markers of proinflammatory cytokines, TNF-α, IFNγ, IL-6, and IL-17A, were increased in FcγRIIb -/- mice and etanercept antagonized these effects in FcγRIIb -/- mice. Etanercept increased serum PTH levels in the FcγRIIb -/- mouse model of lupus. Our results suggest that deletion of FcγRIIb induces osteopenia by increasing the level of proinflammatory cytokines. Etanercept is effective in preventing mandibular bone loss in FcγRIIb -/- mice, suggesting that anti-TNF-α therapy may be able to ameliorate mandibular bone loss in SLE patients with periodontitis."

It can delays recovery, prolongs hospitalization, necessitates readmission, and adds to hospital bills and other morbidities as well as mortalities. Method Facility-based case-control study was conducted from 1 st March to 20 th April, 2019 among all the mother records enrolled from 1 st January to 31 st December, 2018 at Public hospitals in Dire Dawa administration. The records of the mothers’ who had post-cesarean section surgical site infection (119) was extracted by a census and every three consecutive controls (357) for each case were collected by trained data collectors using a structured data extraction tool. Variables which had p-value &lt;0.25 in bivariate analysis were considered as candidates for multivariable analysis. Statistical significance was declared at P-value ≤0.05 with adjusted odd ratio and 95% confidence interval in the multivariable logistic regression model. Result Age 20–34 years (AOR:5.4; 95%CI:2.35,12.7), age &gt;35 years (AOR:8.9; 95%CI:1.8,43.9), ≥4 per vaginal examinations (AOR: 4.2; 95%CI:2.16,8.22), current history of Chorioamnionitis (AOR:5; 95%CI:1.05,23.9), previous history of cesarean section (AOR:6.2; 95%CI: 2.72,14.36), provision of antibiotics prophylaxis (AOR:3.2; 95%CI:1.81,5.62), perioperative HCT level &lt;30% (AOR:6.9; 95%CI:3.45,14.1) and duration of rupture of membrane &gt;12 hours (AOR:5.4; 95%CI:1.84,15.87) were the independent determinants of post-cesarean section surgical site infection. Conclusion Increased in age of the mother, higher number of per vaginal examination, having a history of chorioamnionitis, having previous history of cesarean section, not receiving antibiotics prophylaxis, lower perioperative hematocrit level and longer duration of rupture of membrane were statistically significant in multivariable analysis. Therefore; emphasis should be given for mothers who have higher age category, previous cesarean scar and history of choriamnionitis. In addition; provision of antibiotics should be comprehensive for all mothers undergoing cesarean section."
https://openalex.org/W3155445257,"Heme oxygenases (HOs) play a critical role in recouping iron from the labile heme pool. The acquisition and liberation of heme iron are especially important for the survival of pathogenic bacteria. All characterized HOs, including those belonging to the HugZ superfamily, preferentially cleave free b-type heme. Another common form of heme found in nature is c-type heme, which is covalently linked to proteinaceous cysteine residues. However, mechanisms for direct iron acquisition from the c-type heme pool are unknown. Here we identify a HugZ homolog from the oligopeptide permease (opp) gene cluster of Paracoccus denitrificans that lacks any observable reactivity with heme b and show that it instead rapidly degrades c-type hemopeptides. This c-type heme oxygenase catalyzes the oxidative cleavage of the model substrate microperoxidase-11 at the β- and/or δ-meso position(s), yielding the corresponding peptide-linked biliverdin, CO, and free iron. X-ray crystallographic analysis suggests that the switch in substrate specificity from b-to c-type heme involves loss of the N-terminal α/β domain and C-terminal loop containing the coordinating histidine residue characteristic of HugZ homologs, thereby accommodating a larger substrate that provides its own iron ligand. These structural features are also absent in certain heme utilization/storage proteins from human pathogens that exhibit low or no HO activity with free heme. This study thus expands the scope of known iron acquisition strategies to include direct oxidative cleavage of heme-containing proteolytic fragments of c-type cytochromes and helps to explain why certain oligopeptide permeases show specificity for the import of heme in addition to peptides.

Iron is an essential element for life. Organisms have therefore developed sophisticated machinery for obtaining, transporting, and storing iron (1Andrews S.C. Robinson A.K. Rodríguez-Quiñones F. Bacterial iron homeostasis.FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2003; 27: 215-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (1615) Google Scholar). Iron acquisition is particularly important for bacterial pathogens to establish and maintain infections (2Ratledge C. Dover L.G. Iron metabolism in pathogenic bacteria.Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2000; 54: 881-941Crossref PubMed Scopus (1103) Google Scholar). Many pathogenic bacteria synthesize and secrete siderophores, high-affinity iron chelators that scavenge free ferric iron (3Wilson B.R. Bogdan A.R. Miyazawa M. Hashimoto K. Tsuji Y. Siderophores in iron metabolism: From mechanism to therapy potential.Trends Mol. Med. 2016; 22: 1077-1090Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). The Fe(III)-siderophore complex is then imported into the cell, where the iron is released (e.g., via reduction to the less tightly bound ferrous state) (4Schalk I.J. Guillon L. Fate of ferrisiderophores after import across bacterial outer membranes: Different iron release strategies are observed in the cytoplasm or periplasm depending on the siderophore pathways.Amino Acids. 2013; 44: 1267-1277Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). However, in many hosts, including humans, iron is predominantly found complexed with protoporphyrin IX in the form of heme. Thus, bacteria also typically contain transport systems to acquire heme from the environment (5Tong Y. Guo M. Bacterial heme-transport proteins and their heme-coordination modes.Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2009; 481: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). A dedicated enzyme, heme oxygenase (HO), is then required to liberate the tightly bound iron from heme under aerobic or microaerophilic conditions (6Frankenberg-Dinkel N. Bacterial heme oxygenases.Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2004; 6: 825-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). In addition to serving as the substrate of HO, heme is utilized as a cofactor that facilitates its own oxidative cleavage (7Wilks A. Heinzl G. Heme oxygenation and the widening paradigm of heme degradation.Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2014; 544: 87-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). There are several distinct groups of HO, which differ in their structural folds and in the regiospecificity of their ring cleavage reactions (8Lyles K.V. Eichenbaum Z. From host heme to iron: The expanding spectrum of heme degrading enzymes used by pathogenic bacteria.Front. Cell. Infect. Microbiol. 2018; 8: 198Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The first HO, HO-1, was isolated from rat microsomes in the late 1960s and is a monomeric α-only protein (9Tenhunen R. Marver H.S. Schmid R.

HO-1 and most other canonical HOs from this group (such as HmuO from Corynebacterium diphtheriae and HemO from Neisseria meningitidis) cleave heme at the α-meso position, releasing ferrous iron and producing biliverdin IXα (α-biliverdin) and carbon monoxide as coproducts (Fig. 1) (12Schmitt M.P.

The second group of HOs are structurally and functionally related to the iron-regulated surface determinants protein, IsdG, from Staphylococcus aureus (15Wu R. Skaar E.P. Zhang R. Joachimiak G. Gornicki P. Schneewind O. Joachimiak A. Staphylococcus aureus IsdG and IsdI, heme-degrading enzymes with structural similarity to monooxygenases.J. Biol.

IsdG belongs to the antibiotic biosynthesis monooxygenase (ABM) superfamily and contains a ferredoxin-like fold (16Acharya G. Kaur G. Subramanian S. Evolutionary relationships between heme-binding ferredoxin α + β barrels.BMC Bioinformatics. 2016; 17: 168Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). In contrast to canonical HOs, IsdG cleaves heme at the β- or δ-meso positions to form a mixture of β- and δ-staphylobilins and formaldehyde (Fig. 1) (17Reniere M.L. Ukpabi G.N. Harry S.R. Stec D.F.

Heme degradation by Staphylococcus aureus IsdG and IsdI liberates formaldehyde rather than carbon monoxide.Biochemistry. 2013; 52: 3025-3027Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The structure of staphylobilin differs from that of the corresponding biliverdin by the presence of an oxo group at the unopened β- or δ-meso position. Another member of this group, MhuD from Mycobacterium tuberculosis, cleaves heme at the α-position; however, the meso carbon is retained in the product as a formyl group, yielding a mixture of mycobilins a and b (Fig. 1) (19Nambu S. Matsui T. Goulding C.W. Takahashi S. Ikeda-Saito M. A new way to degrade heme: The Mycobacterium tuberculosis enzyme MhuD catalyzes heme degradation without generating CO.J. Biol. Chem. 2013; 288: 10101-10109Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Mycobilins a and b also contain an oxo group at the β- and δ-meso position, respectively. The third group of HOs contain tandem repeats of a motif named after its founding member, HemS (20Schneider S. Sharp K.H. Barker P.D. Paoli M.

Chem. 2006; 281: 32606-32610Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The HemS homolog HmuS from Yersinia pseudotuberculosis was found to convert heme to a mixture of β- and δ-biliverdins, analogous to the reaction catalyzed by PigA (Fig. 1) (21Onzuka M. Sekine Y. Uchida T. Ishimori K. Ozaki S.-I. HmuS from Yersinia pseudotuberculosis is a non-canonical heme-degrading enzyme to acquire iron from heme.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2017; 1861: 1870-1878Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). In contrast, ChuS, a HemS homolog from Escherichia coli O157:H7, was shown to facilitate the peroxide-dependent conversion of heme to hematinic acid and a tripyrrole via ring cleavage at adjacent meso positions (i.e., γ/β and/or γ/δ) (Fig. 1) (22Ouellet Y.H.

Biochem. 2016; 154: 103-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). The final group of HOs belong to the HugZ superfamily, as typified by the enzyme from Helicobacter pylori, which cleaves heme specifically at the δ-meso position and produces δ-biliverdin (Fig. 1) (23Guo Y. Guo G. Mao X. Zhang W. Xiao J. Tong W. Liu T. Xiao B. Liu X. Feng Y. Zou Q. Functional identification of HugZ, a heme oxygenase from Helicobacter pylori.BMC Microbiol. 2008; 8: 226Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Homologs of HugZ are abundant in Proteobacteria and belong to a larger superfamily of dimeric split β-barrel enzymes that include flavin (FMN/FAD)- and deazaflavin (F420)-dependent oxidoreductases (24Ahmed F.H. Carr P.D. Lee B.M. Afriat-Jurnou L. Mohamed A.E. Hong N.-S. Flanagan J. Taylor M.C. Greening C. Jackson C.J. Sequence-structure-function classification of a catalytically diverse oxidoreductase superfamily in mycobacteria.J. Mol. Biol. 2015; 427: 3554-3571Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The two heme-binding sites of HugZ are located at the intermonomer interface (Fig. 2A) (25Hu Y. Jiang F. Guo Y. Shen X. Zhang Y. Zhang R. Guo G. Mao X. Zou Q. Wang D.-C. Crystal structure of HugZ, a novel heme oxygenase from Helicobacter pylori.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 1537-1544Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Notably, the active site is framed by the N-terminal α/β-type domain, which interacts with both the α-meso edge of heme and the C-terminal loop containing a histidine residue that serves as the axial ligand to the heme substrate (Fig. 2A) (25Hu Y. Jiang F. Guo Y. Shen X. Zhang Y. Zhang R. Guo G. Mao X. Zou Q. Wang D.-C. Crystal structure of HugZ, a novel heme oxygenase from Helicobacter pylori.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 1537-1544Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Linking all known HOs across these structural and functional differences is a preferential degradation of free, b-type heme as their substrate (8Lyles K.V. Eichenbaum Z. From host heme to iron: The expanding spectrum of heme degrading enzymes used by pathogenic bacteria.Front. Cell. Infect. Microbiol. 2018; 8: 198Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Yet in addition to b-type heme, one of the most prevalent forms of heme found in nature is c-type heme, wherein the vinyl groups of the porphyrin macrocycle are covalently linked via thioether bonds to proteinaceous cysteine residues from a conserved CXXCH motif (26Bowman S.E.J. Bren K.L. The chemistry and biochemistry of heme c: Functional bases for covalent attachment.Nat. Prod. Rep. 2008; 25: 1118-1130Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The terminal histidine residue of this c-type heme-binding motif serves as the axial ligand to the heme iron (26Bowman S.E.J. Bren K.L. The chemistry and biochemistry of heme c: Functional bases for covalent attachment.Nat. Prod. Rep. 2008; 25: 1118-1130Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). HO-1 was previously shown to have some activity with heme c derivatives, although the catalytic efficiency was more than an order of magnitude less than with free heme (27Yoshinaga T. Sassa S. Kappas A. The oxidative degradation of heme c by the microsomal heme oxygenase system.J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 7803-7807Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Kutty R.K. Maines M.D. Oxidation of heme c derivatives by purified heme oxygenase. Evidence for the presence of one molecular species of heme oxygenase in the rat liver.J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 9944-9952Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, specific mechanisms for direct iron acquisition from the c-type heme pool remain unknown. Paracoccus denitrificans is a metabolically versatile Gram-negative alphaproteobacterium, capable of chemoautotrophic growth on hydrogen/thiosulfate and C1 compounds (e.g., CO2, methanol, methylamines) or heterotrophic growth using oxygen (aerobic respiration) or nitrate/nitrite (denitrification) as terminal electron acceptors (29Baker S.C. Ferguson S.J. Ludwig B. Page M.D. Richter O.M. van Spanning R.J. Molecular genetics of the genus Paracoccus: Metabolically versatile bacteria with bioenergetic flexibility.Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1998; 62: 1046-1078Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In each of these metabolic pathways, c-type cytochromes (heme c binding proteins such as cytochrome c550, bc1, and cd1) play critical roles as components of the relevant electron transport chains (30Ferguson S.J. The functions and synthesis of bacterial c-type cytochromes with particular reference to Paracoccus denitrificans and Rhodobacter capsulatus.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1058: 17-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The genome of P. denitrificans contains a cluster of genes that encode a homolog of the oligopeptide permease (Opp) system (Fig. 2C) (31Slamti L. Lereclus D. The oligopeptide ABC-importers are essential communication channels in Gram-positive bacteria.Res. Microbiol. 2019; 170: 338-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). The Opp system is an ATP-binding cassette (ABC)-type transporter consisting of a membrane-associated substrate-binding lipoprotein (OppA), a hydrophobic transmembrane channel (OppBC), and two intracellular ATPase subunits (OppDF). OppA is a cluster C type substrate-binding protein, members of which have recently been shown to bind and facilitate the transport of heme in addition to short peptides (32Scheepers G.H. Lycklama a Nijeholt J.A. Poolman B. An updated structural classification of substrate-binding proteins.FEBS Lett. 2016; 590: 4393-4401Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 33Tanaka K.J. Pinkett H.W. Oligopeptide-binding protein from nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae has ligand-specific sites to accommodate peptides and heme in the binding pocket.J. Biol. Chem. 2019; 294: 1070-1082Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Within the opp operon is a gene (pden_1323) annotated by the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) as a pyridoxamine 5′-phosphate (PMP) oxidase-related FMN-binding protein (Fig. 2C). PMP oxidases belong to the same superfamily as HugZ-like HOs, which motivated investigation of Pden_1323 as a HO (24Ahmed F.H. Carr P.D. Lee B.M. Afriat-Jurnou L. Mohamed A.E. Hong N.-S. Flanagan J. Taylor M.C. Greening C. Jackson C.J. Sequence-structure-function classification of a catalytically diverse oxidoreductase superfamily in mycobacteria.J. Mol. Biol. 2015; 427: 3554-3571Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Here, we show that Pden_1323 is an unusual HO that shows specificity for the degradation of c-type heme instead of b-type heme, differentiating it from all previously characterized HOs. The crystal structure of Pden_1323 contains only a partial active site relative to HugZ, suggesting that it can accommodate a c-type hemopeptide substrate that provides its own histidine ligand. Activity assays of Pden_1323 with the hemopeptide substrate microperoxidase-11 (MP-11) show c-type heme degradation to free iron, CO, and a peptide-linked β- and/or δ-biliverdin. The structural and kinetic results together demonstrate Pden_1323 as a novel c-type heme oxygenase (CHO), indicating the ability of P. denitrificans to acquire iron from direct oxidative cleavage of c-type cytochrome fragments containing heme. The codon-optimized version of pden_1323 was synthesized for heterologous expression in E. coli. The purified enzyme was tested for its ability to oxidize PMP and pyridoxine 5′-phosphate (PNP), but no activity was observed with either substrate using FMN, FAD, F420, or 8-hydroxy-5-deazaflavin (Fo). Pden_1323 was also tested for HO activity using hemin as the substrate. Again, no significant activity above the background level was detected using ascorbate as the reductant (Fig. 3A). The X-ray crystal structure of Pden_1323 was solved and found to form a dimeric split β-barrel similar to HugZ (Fig. 2) (25Hu Y. Jiang F. Guo Y. Shen X. Zhang Y. Zhang R. Guo G. Mao X. Zou Q. Wang D.-C. Crystal structure of HugZ, a novel heme oxygenase from Helicobacter pylori.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 1537-1544Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). However, comparison of the active sites of Pden_1323 and HugZ shows stark differences. While the two residues of HugZ that form salt bridging interactions with the carboxylates of heme, His163 and Arg166, are conserved in the structure of Pden_1323 (His64 and Arg92), the entire N-terminal α/β domain of HugZ is not present in the structure of Pden_1323 (25Hu Y. Jiang F. Guo Y. Shen X. Zhang Y. Zhang R. Guo G. Mao X. Zou Q. Wang D.-C. Crystal structure of HugZ, a novel heme oxygenase from Helicobacter pylori.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 1537-1544Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the C-terminal loop that contains the coordinating heme ligand is not found in the Pden_1323 structure (Fig. 2) (25Hu Y. Jiang F. Guo Y. Shen X. Zhang Y. Zhang R. Guo G. Mao X. Zou Q. Wang D.-C. Crystal structure of HugZ, a novel heme oxygenase from Helicobacter pylori.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 1537-1544Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Taken together, the lack of the N-terminal domain and C-terminal loop indicates that the presumed active site of Pden_1323 is only partially formed, which provides a rationale for Pden_1323's lack of HO activity with free heme. Given these structural characteristics, combined with the fact that pden_1323 is found within a gene cluster that is likely involved in the transport of both heme and peptides, it was reasoned that the substrate of Pden_1323 may instead be a c-type hemopeptide. When Pden_1323 was incubated with ascorbate and MP-11, an 11 amino acid heme-containing fragment of equine heart cytochrome c, a rapid decrease in the Soret band of MP-11 was observed (Fig. 3B) (34Tu A.T. Reinosa J.A. Hsiao Y.Y. Peroxidative activity of hemepeptides from horse heart cytochrome c.Experientia. 1968; 24: 219-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The loss of the c-type heme chromophore was both enzyme and reductant-dependent (Fig. 3, B and C). In the presence of catalase, the Pden_1323-catalyzed degradation of MP-11 occurred with a specific activity of 3.9 nmol/min/mg and displayed sigmoidal kinetics with a turnover number (kcat) of 0.076 ± 0.0006 min−1, an apparent dissociation (Michaelis) constant (Km) of 2.0 ± 0.03 μM, and a Hill coefficient of 2.6 ± 0.08 (Fig. 3D). Both CO (Fig. 3E) and free iron (Fig. 3F) were detected as coproducts of the reaction (using myoglobin and ferrozine assays, respectively). High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis of the Pden_1323 reaction mixture showed conversion of MP-11 to a product with a mass (theoretical [M + H]+ m/z = 1827.82) and UV–visible absorption spectrum that are consistent with a peptide-linked biliverdin (Fig. 4A). Tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) of the Pden_1323 reaction product showed that the 1827.82 ion could be cleaved into peptide (theoretical m/z = 1245.57) and bilin (theoretical m/z = 583.26) components by increasing the collision energy (Fig. 4, B and C). LC-MS/MS analysis of the bilin peak (Fig. 4D) yielded a fragmentation pattern that is distinct from that obtained with α-biliverdin (Fig. S1) and consistent with oxidized biliverdin fragments containing A-B-C (or B-A-D) rings (theoretical m/z = 421.20) and C-B-D (or A-D-C) rings (theoretical m/z = 495.20). Thus, the MS data suggest that the product of the reaction is a peptide linked β- and/or δ-biliverdin. No Pden_1323-catalyzed heme degradation activity was observed when full-length cytochrome c was used as the substrate (Fig. S2). However, when cytochrome c was digested with trypsin to generate a short 9 amino acid hemopeptide (i.e., MP-9), rapid loss of the Soret band was once again observed at a rate comparable to that of MP-11 (Fig. S3). The MP-9 sequence is missing the three N-terminal residues of MP-11 (VQK) and has a C-terminal lysine not present in the MP-11 sequence. This suggests that the exact sequence of the hemopeptide is not critical for recognition and cleavage by Pden_1323, though the coordinating histidine residue is present in both MP-11 and MP-9. Consistent with this observation, when hemin was incubated with a high concentration of imidazole (where ∼90% is expected to be coordinated given an estimated Kd ∼ 200 μM), Pden_1323 is now able to cleave it (Fig. 3A). Taken together, the activity assays demonstrate that Pden_1323 is a novel c-type heme oxygenase (CHO) that shows specificity for the degradation of c-type hemopeptides over free b-type heme. The results of the MS experiments and myoglobin/ferrozine assays further indicate that Pden_1323 catalyzes the oxidative cleavage of c-type hemopeptides to a peptide-linked β- and/or δ-biliverdin with concomitant formation of CO and free iron. The inability of Pden_1323 to cleave full-length cytochrome c shows that the peptide linkage must be small enough so that the porphyrin macrocycle is not buried and is able to access the active site, while the cleavage of hemin at high imidazole concentration indicates that the histidine lower axial ligand (rather than the c-type thioether linkages or the peptide sequence) is the crucial factor enabling catalysis. This suggests that Pden_1323 may bind a range of hemopeptide substrates in a way that creates a HugZ-like active site, with the histidine residue provided by the peptide substrate coordinating and activating the heme iron. After substrate binding, the mechanism of Pden_1323-catalyzed c-type heme degradation is expected to proceed analogously to that of HugZ (25Hu Y. Jiang F. Guo Y. Shen X. Zhang Y. Zhang R. Guo G. Mao X. Zou Q. Wang D.-C. Crystal structure of HugZ, a novel heme oxygenase from Helicobacter pylori.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 1537-1544Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The exact physiological role of Pden_1323 in the soil microbe P. denitrificans has yet to be established. It may be involved in acquiring iron from environmental hemopeptides (e.g., from degraded extracellular cytochromes). However, given the large number of c-type cytochromes utilized by this metabolically versatile bacterium, Pden_1323 may also play an important role in general cell maintenance by recycling iron from damaged cytochromes (30Ferguson S.J. The functions and synthesis of bacterial c-type cytochromes with particular reference to Paracoccus denitrificans and Rhodobacter capsulatus.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1058: 17-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The structural comparison of HugZ and Pden_1323 suggests that the change in substrate specificity from free heme b to a c-type hemopeptide involves the loss of the C-terminal loop containing the coordinating heme ligand and an opening of the active site to accommodate the larger substrate via loss of the N-terminal α/β domain (25Hu Y. Jiang F. Guo Y. Shen X. Zhang Y. Zhang R. Guo G. Mao X. Zou Q. Wang D.-C. Crystal structure of HugZ, a novel heme oxygenase from Helicobacter pylori.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 1537-1544Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Similar structural features are also observed in the heme storage protein HutZ from Vibrio cholerae and the heme utilization protein HupZ from Group A streptococcus (GAS) (35Liu X. Gong J. Wei T. Wang Z. Du Q. Zhu D. Huang Y. Xu S. Gu L.

HutZ is required for optimal heme utilization in V. cholerae, although no HO activity was initially observed with hemin (35Liu X. Gong J. Wei T. Wang Z. Du Q. Zhu D. Huang Y. Xu S. Gu L. Crystal structure of HutZ, a heme storage protein from Vibrio cholerae: A structural mismatch observed in the region of high sequence conservation.BMC Struct. Biol. 2012; 12: 23Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). However, subsequent work by Uchida and coworkers suggests that HutZ functions as a HO at pH values below 8.0, producing the typical oxyferrous heme, meso-hydroxyheme, and verdoheme intermediates with regiospecificity similar to HugZ (37Uchida T. Sekine Y. Matsui T. Ikeda-Saito M. Ishimori K. A heme degradation enzyme, HutZ, from Vibrio cholerae.Chem. Commun. (Camb.). 2012; 48: 6741-6743Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 38Uchida T.

Reaction intermediates in the heme degradation reaction by HutZ from Vibrio cholerae.Dalton Trans. 2017; 46: 8104-8109Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). While HutZ lacks the N-terminal α/β domain, it retains the C-terminal loop containing the conserved histidine lower axial ligand, which is important for its heme degradation activity (39Uchida T. Dojun N. Sekine Y. Ishimori K. Heme proximal hydrogen bonding between His170 and Asp132 plays an essential role in the heme degradation reaction of HutZ from Vibrio cholerae.Biochemistry. 2017; 56: 2723-2734Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). In contrast, HupZ lacks both the N-terminal α/β domain and C-terminal loop and thus more closely resembles Pden_1323 (36Sachla A.J. Ouattara M. Romero E. Agniswamy J. Weber I.T. Gadda G. Eichenbaum Z. In vitro heme biotransformation by the HupZ enzyme from Group A streptococcus.Biometals. 2016; 29: 593-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Interestingly, HupZ was shown to copurify with heme when it was overexpressed in E. coli grown in the presence of 5-aminolevulinic acid and iron and demonstrated modest hemin degrading activity (36Sachla A.J.

It should be measured among different population groups to effectively implement public health interventions. Thus, this study aimed to determine the magnitude of unmet need for family planning and associated factors among HIV- positive women in Dire Dawa city Anti-retroviral treatment (ART) clinics, Eastern Ethiopia. Methods We carried out a facility-based cross-sectional study (March-June 2020) among 409 married women aged 15–49 on ART, using systematic random sampling. A face-to-face interview was done using a structured questionnaire. Bivariable and multivariable logistic regression was done to identify factors associated with unmet need for family planning. Results Overall, 33% [95% confidence interval (CI): 28.9–37.9] of the respondents had unmet need for family planning. Woman’s residing in a rural area (adjusted odds ratio (AOR): 2.41 [95% CI: 1.24–4.67]), woman’s not attained formal education (AOR: 4.14 [95% CI: 1.73–9.93]) and attaining primary education (AOR: 2.97 [95% CI: 1.54–5.74]), poor knowledge (AOR: 2.87 [95% CI: 1.52–5.40]), and unfavorable attitude towards family planning (AOR: 2.21 [95% CI: 1.12–4.34]), clients not satisfied with family planning service (AOR: 6.34 [95% CI: 3.31–12.15]), the woman not having decision making power on family planning (AOR:3.97 [95% CI: 2.14–7.38]) and not getting family planning counseling in ART clinics (AOR: 2.87 [95% CI: 1.54–5.35]) were positively associated with having unmet need for family planning. Conclusion This study indicates there a high unmet need for family planning among married HIV-positive women. Factors like a place of residence, educational status of women, knowledge and attitude towards family planning, client satisfaction with FP service, women decision-making power, and FP counseling service in ART. Therefore, we recommend that the concerned bodies should collaborate with ART clinics to design interventions that enhance access to family planning programs to combat the high unmet need for family planning among HIV-positive women."
https://openalex.org/W3152726369,"Background Smoke-free ordinances (SFO) have been shown to be effective public health interventions, but there is limited data on the impact SFO on lung cancer outcomes. We explored the effect of county-level SFO strength with smoking prevalence and lung cancer incidence in Indiana. Methods We obtained county-level lung cancer incidence from the Indiana State Cancer Registry and county-level characteristics from the Indiana Tobacco Prevention and Cessation Commission’s policy database between 1995 and 2016. Using generalized estimating equations, we performed multivariable analyses of smoking prevalence and age-adjusted lung cancer rates with respect to the strength of smoke-free ordinances at the county level over time. Results Of Indiana’s 92 counties, 24 had a SFO by 2011. In 2012, Indiana enacted a state-wide SFO enforcing at least moderate level SFO protection. Mean age-adjusted lung cancer incidence per year was 76.8 per 100,000 population and mean smoking prevalence per year was 25% during the study period. Counties with comprehensive or moderate SFO had a smoking prevalence 1.2% (95% CI [-1.88, -0.52]) lower compared with counties with weak or no SFO. Counties that had comprehensive or moderate SFO also had an 8.4 (95% CI [-11.5, -5.3]) decrease in new lung cancer diagnosis per 100,000 population per year compared with counties that had weak or no SFO. Conclusion Counties with stronger smoke-free air ordinances were associated with decreased smoking prevalence and fewer new lung cancer cases per year. Strengthening SFO is paramount to decreasing lung cancer incidence."

Although BMD reduction in AS may be presumed to be due to spinal inflammation, this study was designed to confirm whether immobilization of the spine due to syndesmophytes is related to BMD reduction, as immobilization itself is a risk factor for BMD reduction. Methods Among male patients diagnosed with AS according to the modified New York criteria, those who underwent bone density tests with quantitative computed tomography (QCT) were retrospectively analyzed through a chart review. The correlation between the presence or absence of bone bridges for each vertebral body level of the L spine confirmed with radiography and BMD confirmed with QCT was analyzed. Results A total of 47 male patients with AS were enrolled. The mean patient age was 46.8 ± 8.2 years, and the mean disease duration was 7.9 ± 6.4 years. The trabecular BMD of the lumbar spine (L1-L4) ranged from 23.1 to 158.45 mg/cm 3 (mean 102.2 ± 37 mg/cm 3 ), as measured with QCT. The lumbar BMD measurements showed that 30 patients (63.8%) had osteopenia or osteoporosis. Bone bridge formation showed a negative correlation with BMD. Low BMD was significantly correlated with bone bridge in the vertebral body ( p &lt; 0.05). Positive correlations were observed between bone bridge score and BASMI flexion score, whereas significant negative correlations were found between BMD and BASMI flexion score ( p &lt; 0.05). Conclusion Decreased mobility of the vertebrae due to bone bridge formation affects the decrease in BMD in patients with AS."
https://openalex.org/W3154811522,"In-line with the World Health Organization’s (WHO) Global Technical Strategy for Malaria (2016–2030), Vietnam is striving to eliminate malaria by 2030. Targeting appropriate interventions in high-risk populations such as forest and forest-fringe communities is a critical component of malaria elimination efforts in Vietnam. In 2016, a household-level malaria indicator survey was conducted in Phu Yen Province, Vietnam with the aim of assessing the knowledge, behaviors and associated risks of malaria infection among priority mobile and migrant populations (MMPs) working and sleeping in forests and on farms. A total of 4211 people were included in the survey, comprised of 1074 heads of households and 3137 associated household members. Of the 1074 head-of-household respondents, 472 slept in a forest, 92 slept on a farm, 132 slept in both forests and farms, and 378 slept at their villages within the last 12 months. Age, literacy, and occupation were significantly different among those who slept in a forest versus on a farm. Of 301 respondents who answered questions about malaria risk factors at sleeping sites, 35% were somewhat aware of malaria prevention practices, but only 4% could recall at least four malaria prevention messages. Among the same group of 301 respondents, only 29% used nets and only 11% used treated nets. Ownership and use of nets among forest-goers was significantly lower than those who slept on a farm or in their village. Huts without walls were significantly prominent forest sleeping site locations (POR = 10.3; 95% CI 4.67–22.7). All respondents who slept in a forest requested standby malaria drugs and one-third of them self-treated without blood testing. Results from this study highlight the importance of capturing relevant location-specific data among priority populations such as remote forest and farm going mobile and migrant populations in Vietnam. Data regarding behavioral practices, knowledge, preventative measures, and intervention coverage at remote-area transmission sites must be routinely captured to effectively monitor progress and refine targeted intervention strategies accordingly."
https://openalex.org/W3154904638,"The proteasome is a large protease complex that degrades many different cellular proteins. In eukaryotes, the 26S proteasome contains six different subunits of the ATPases associated with diverse cellular activities family, Rpt1–Rpt6, which form a hexameric ring as part of the base subcomplex that drives unfolding and translocation of substrates into the proteasome core. Archaeal proteasomes contain only a single Rpt-like ATPases associated with diverse cellular activities ATPase, the proteasome-activating nucleotidase, which forms a trimer of dimers. A key proteasome-activating nucleotidase proline residue (P91) forms cis- and trans-peptide bonds in successive subunits around the ring, allowing efficient dimerization through upstream coiled coils. However, the importance of the equivalent Rpt prolines for eukaryotic proteasome assembly was unknown. Here we showed that the equivalent proline is highly conserved in Rpt2, Rpt3, and Rpt5, and loosely conserved in Rpt1, in deeply divergent eukaryotes. Although in no case was a single Pro-to-Ala substitution in budding yeast strongly deleterious to growth, the rpt5–P76A mutation decreased levels of the protein and induced a mild proteasome assembly defect. Moreover, the rpt2–P103A, rpt3–P93A, and rpt5–P76A mutations all caused synthetic defects when combined with deletions of specific proteasome base assembly chaperones. The rpt2–P103A rpt5–P76A double mutant had uniquely strong growth defects attributable to defects in proteasome base formation. Several Rpt subunits in this mutant formed aggregates that were cleared, at least in part, by Hsp42 chaperone-mediated protein quality control. We propose that the conserved Rpt linker prolines promote efficient 26S proteasome base assembly by facilitating specific ATPase heterodimerization."
https://openalex.org/W3156113985,"Background The influence of mothers’ and fathers’ educational levels in separate evaluations of asthma has not been fully investigated. This study aims to examine the associations of the mother’s and fathers’ educational levels with childhood wheeze and asthma adjusting for crude and pre-and post-natal modifiable risk factors. Methods We conducted a prospective cohort study using data from the Japan Environment and Children’s Study, which recruited pregnant women from 2011 to 2014. The mother’s and father’s educational levels were surveyed by a questionnaire during the pregnancy, and childhood wheezing and doctor-diagnosed asthma were estimated using a 3-year questionnaire. Multilevel logistic regression analysis was performed to evaluate the association between the mother’s and father’s educational levels and childhood wheezing and asthma, adjusted for pre-and post-natal factors. Results A total of 69,607 pairs of parents and their single infants were analyzed. We found 17.3% of children had wheezing and 7.7% had asthma. In crude analyses, lower educational level of parents was associated with an increased risk of childhood wheezing and asthma. After full adjustment, a lower educational level of mothers was associated with an increased risk of childhood asthma (junior high school (reference: high school); odds ratio (OR): 1.17, 95% CI, 1.01–1.36), and higher educational level, especially the mother’s, was associated with an increased risk of childhood wheezing (technical junior college, technical/vocational college, or associate degree (ECD3); OR: 1.12, 95% CI, 1.06–1.18, bachelor’s degree, or postgraduate degree; OR: 1.10, 95% CI, 1.03–1.18), and asthma (ECD3; OR: 1.13, 95% CI, 1.04–1.21). Conclusions Parents’ lower educational level was a crude risk factor for childhood wheezing and asthma. However, an increased risk of wheezing due to mothers’ higher educational level was found after adjusting for pre-and post-natal factors."
https://openalex.org/W3156488343,"We aimed to estimate vaccination coverage and factors associated in completing schemes in children under 5 years old between 2000 and 2018. A secondary analysis was carried out on five national health surveys between 2000 and 2018 in Mexico. The sample was 53,898 children under 5 years old, where 30% of missing vaccination information was imputed using chained equations. During this period two basic vaccination schemes (CBS) were identified. For each doses and vaccines of both schemes and completed CBS, the coverage was estimated using weighted logistic regression models. Additionally, the factors associated with incomplete schemes were reported. Between 2000 and 2018, the caretakers who did not show the vaccination card went from 13.8% to 45.6%. During this period, the estimated vaccination coverages did not exceed 95%, except for BCG and marginally the first doses of vaccines against pneumococcus, acellular pentavalent, and Sabin. In the same period, the CBS estimated coverage decreased steadily and was under 90%, except for children aged 6–11 months (92.6%; 91.5–93.7) in 2000. Not having health insurance stands out as an associated factor with incomplete vaccination schemes. In conclusion, the imputation allowed to recuperate information and obtain better data of vaccination coverage. The estimated vaccination coverage and CBS do not reach sufficient levels to guarantee herd immunity, hence innovative strategies to improve vaccination must be established in Mexico."
https://openalex.org/W3154758320,"The uterus undergoes distinct molecular and functional changes during pregnancy and parturition. These processes are associated with the dramatic changes in various proteins. Given that the maturation and activation of many proteins require proteolytic processing by proprotein convertases (PCs), we sought to explore the role of PCs in uterine activation for labor. First, we found that furin was the most dramatically increased PC member in myometrial tissues from the pregnant women after onset of labor at term. Using the model of cultured human myometrial smooth muscle cells (HMSMCs), we showed that furin inhibitor CMK, D6R treatment and furin siRNA transfection suppressed contractility. Inhibition of furin activity or interfering furin expression decreased connexin 43 (CX43), prostaglandin (PG) endoperoxide synthase-2 (COX-2) and PGF2α receptor (FP) expression and NF-κB activation. In mouse model, administration of furin inhibitors prolonged gestational length. However, D6R treatment did not affect RU38486- and lipopolysaccharides (LPS)-induced preterm birth. Furthermore, D6R and furin siRNA treatment reduced the release of soluble form of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-related weak inducer of apoptosis (TWEAK), while furin overexpression led to an increase in soluble TWEAK release in cultured HMSMCs. D6R treatment decreased TWEAK level in blood of pregnant mice. TWEAK treatment promoted contractility and NF-κB activation, while TWEAK receptor fibroblast growth factor-inducible 14 (FN14) antagonist treatment inhibited contractility and NF-κB activation in HMSMCs. In pregnant mice, administration of FN14 antagonist prolonged gestational length. Our data suggest that furin can act as a stimulator for uterine activation for labor at term. TWEAK is one of the potential substrates which mediate furin regulation of parturition initiation."
https://openalex.org/W3154723221,"Accelerated cognitive ageing (ACA) is an ageing co-morbidity in epilepsy that is diagnosed through the observation of an evident IQ decline of more than 1 standard deviation (15 points) around the age of 50 years old. To understand the mechanism of action of this pathology, we assessed brain dynamics with the use of resting-state fMRI data. In this paper, we present novel and promising methods to extract brain dynamics between large-scale resting-state networks: the emulative power, wavelet coherence, and granger causality between the networks were extracted in two resting-state sessions of 24 participants (10 ACA, 14 controls). We also calculated the widely used static functional connectivity to compare the methods. To find the best biomarkers of ACA, and have a better understanding of this epilepsy co-morbidity we compared the aforementioned between-network neurodynamics using classifiers and known machine learning algorithms; and assessed their performance. Results show that features based on the evolutionary game theory on networks approach, the emulative powers, are the best descriptors of the co-morbidity, using dynamics associated with the default mode and dorsal attention networks. With these dynamic markers, linear discriminant analysis could identify ACA patients at 82.9% accuracy. Using wavelet coherence features with decision-tree algorithm, and static functional connectivity features with support vector machine, ACA could be identified at 77.1% and 77.9% accuracy respectively. Granger causality fell short of being a relevant biomarker with best classifiers having an average accuracy of 67.9%. Combining the features based on the game theory, wavelet coherence, Granger-causality, and static functional connectivity- approaches increased the classification performance up to 90.0% average accuracy using support vector machine with a peak accuracy of 95.8%. The dynamics of the networks that lead to the best classifier performances are known to be challenged in elderly. Since our groups were age-matched, the results are in line with the idea of ACA patients having an accelerated cognitive decline. This classification pipeline is promising and could help to diagnose other neuropsychiatric disorders, and contribute to the field of psychoradiology."
https://openalex.org/W3156014328,"The provision of comprehensive prevention services is vital for reducing the high burden of HIV amongst Ukrainian female sex workers (FSWs). To identify barriers and facilitators that influence access to HIV prevention amongst this population between 2009 and 2017, we developed a literature-informed conceptual framework and conducted a document analysis to identify the components of the Ukrainian prevention package (PP). Using the Integrated Bio Behavioural Surveillance Surveys, we then conducted descriptive analyses to explore PP coverage from 2009 to 2017 and the influence of factors, identified by our conceptual framework. After increasing over four years, a drop in PP coverage was observed from 2013 onwards. Being a client of a non-governmental organisation, street and highway solicitation, non-condom use, and knowledge of HIV may influence access to HIV prevention in the Ukrainian context. Future interventions should consider barriers and facilitators to HIV prevention and the multiple structural levels on which they operate."
