Our method detects peptides with higher precision and speed than seven other search engines. Open-pFind identified 70-85% of the tandem mass spectra in four large-scale datasets and 14,064 proteins, each supported by at least two protein-unique peptides, in a human proteome dataset."
https://openalex.org/W2894994712,"We have uncovered the existence of extracellular vesicle (EV)-mediated signaling between cell types within the adipose tissue (AT) proper. This phenomenon became evident in our attempts at generating an adipocyte-specific knockout of caveolin 1 (cav1) protein. Although we effectively ablated the CAV1 gene in adipocytes, cav1 protein remained abundant. With the use of newly generated mouse models, we show that neighboring endothelial cells (ECs) transfer cav1-containing EVs to adipocytes in vivo, which reciprocate by releasing EVs to ECs. AT-derived EVs contain proteins and lipids capable of modulating cellular signaling pathways. Furthermore, this mechanism facilitates transfer of plasma constituents from ECs to the adipocyte. The transfer event is physiologically regulated by fasting/refeeding and obesity, suggesting EVs participate in the tissue response to changes in the systemic nutrient state. This work offers new insights into the complex signaling mechanisms that exist among adipocytes, stromal vascular cells, and, potentially, distal organs."
https://openalex.org/W2895137021,"Skeletal muscle is a complex tissue containing tissue resident muscle stem cells (satellite cells) (MuSCs) important for postnatal muscle growth and regeneration. Quantitative analysis of the biological function of MuSCs and the molecular pathways responsible for a potential juxtavascular niche for MuSCs is currently lacking. We utilized fluorescent reporter mice and muscle tissue clearing to investigate the proximity of MuSCs to capillaries in 3 dimensions. We show that MuSCs express abundant VEGFA, which recruits endothelial cells (ECs) in vitro, whereas blocking VEGFA using both a vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) inhibitor and MuSC-specific VEGFA gene deletion reduces the proximity of MuSCs to capillaries. Importantly, this proximity to the blood vessels was associated with MuSC self-renewal in which the EC-derived Notch ligand Dll4 induces quiescence in MuSCs. We hypothesize that MuSCs recruit capillary ECs via VEGFA, and in return, ECs maintain MuSC quiescence though Dll4."
https://openalex.org/W2895710019,"We analyze whole-genome sequencing data from 141,431 Chinese women generated for non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT). We use these data to characterize the population genetic structure and to investigate genetic associations with maternal and infectious traits. We show that the present day distribution of alleles is a function of both ancient migration and very recent population movements. We reveal novel phenotype-genotype associations, including several replicated associations with height and BMI, an association between maternal age and EMB, and between twin pregnancy and NRG1. Finally, we identify a unique pattern of circulating viral DNA in plasma with high prevalence of hepatitis B and other clinically relevant maternal infections. A GWAS for viral infections identifies an exceptionally strong association between integrated herpesvirus 6 and MOV10L1, which affects piwi-interacting RNA (piRNA) processing and PIWI protein function. These findings demonstrate the great value and potential of accumulating NIPT data for worldwide medical and genetic analyses."
https://openalex.org/W2895606183,"Cardiac differentiation of human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) requires orchestration of dynamic gene regulatory networks during stepwise fate transitions but often generates immature cell types that do not fully recapitulate properties of their adult counterparts, suggesting incomplete activation of key transcriptional networks. We performed extensive single-cell transcriptomic analyses to map fate choices and gene expression programs during cardiac differentiation of hPSCs and identified strategies to improve in vitro cardiomyocyte differentiation. Utilizing genetic gain- and loss-of-function approaches, we found that hypertrophic signaling is not effectively activated during monolayer-based cardiac differentiation, thereby preventing expression of HOPX and its activation of downstream genes that govern late stages of cardiomyocyte maturation. This study therefore provides a key transcriptional roadmap of in vitro cardiac differentiation at single-cell resolution, revealing fundamental mechanisms underlying heart development and differentiation of hPSC-derived cardiomyocytes."
https://openalex.org/W2895245013,"Antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) and antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP) critically contribute to the efficacy of anti-tumor therapeutic antibodies. We report here an unexpected finding that macrophages after ADCP inhibit NK cell-mediated ADCC and T cell-mediated cytotoxicity in breast cancers and lymphomas. Mechanistically, AIM2 is recruited to the phagosomes by FcγR signaling following ADCP and activated by sensing the phagocytosed tumor DNAs through the disrupted phagosomal membrane, which subsequently upregulates PD-L1 and IDO and causes immunosuppression. Combined treatment with anti-HER2 antibody and inhibitors of PD-L1 and IDO enhances anti-tumor immunity and anti-HER2 therapeutic efficacy in mouse models. Furthermore, neoadjuvant trastuzumab therapy significantly upregulates PD-L1 and IDO in the tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) of HER2+ breast cancer patients, correlating with poor trastuzumab response. Collectively, our findings unveil a deleterious role of ADCP macrophages in cancer immunosuppression and suggest that therapeutic antibody plus immune checkpoint blockade may provide synergistic effects in cancer treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2894697822,"The inflammasome is a critical molecular complex that activates interleukin-1 driven inflammation in response to pathogen- and danger-associated signals. Germline mutations in the inflammasome sensor NLRP1 cause Mendelian systemic autoimmunity and skin cancer susceptibility, but its endogenous regulation remains less understood. Here we use a proteomics screen to uncover dipeptidyl dipeptidase DPP9 as a novel interacting partner with human NLRP1 and a related inflammasome regulator, CARD8. DPP9 functions as an endogenous inhibitor of NLRP1 inflammasome in diverse primary cell types from human and mice. DPP8/9 inhibition via small molecule drugs and CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genetic deletion specifically activate the human NLRP1 inflammasome, leading to ASC speck formation, pyroptotic cell death, and secretion of cleaved interleukin-1β. Mechanistically, DPP9 interacts with a unique autoproteolytic domain (Function to Find Domain (FIIND)) found in NLRP1 and CARD8. This scaffolding function of DPP9 and its catalytic activity act synergistically to maintain NLRP1 in its inactive state and repress downstream inflammasome activation. We further identified a single patient-derived germline missense mutation in the NLRP1 FIIND domain that abrogates DPP9 binding, leading to inflammasome hyperactivation seen in the Mendelian autoinflammatory disease Autoinflammation with Arthritis and Dyskeratosis. These results unite recent findings on the regulation of murine Nlrp1b by Dpp8/9 and uncover a new regulatory mechanism for the NLRP1 inflammasome in primary human cells. Our results further suggest that DPP9 could be a multifunctional inflammasome regulator involved in human autoinflammatory diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2895121177,"Neanderthals and modern humans interbred at least twice in the past 100,000 years. While there is evidence that most introgressed DNA segments from Neanderthals to modern humans were removed by purifying selection, less is known about the adaptive nature of introgressed sequences that were retained. We hypothesized that interbreeding between Neanderthals and modern humans led to (1) the exposure of each species to novel viruses and (2) the exchange of adaptive alleles that provided resistance against these viruses. Here, we find that long, frequent-and more likely adaptive-segments of Neanderthal ancestry in modern humans are enriched for proteins that interact with viruses (VIPs). We found that VIPs that interact specifically with RNA viruses were more likely to belong to introgressed segments in modern Europeans. Our results show that retained segments of Neanderthal ancestry can be used to detect ancient epidemics."
https://openalex.org/W2895076946,"Here we present APOBEC-coupled epigenetic sequencing (ACE-seq), a bisulfite-free method for localizing 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) at single-base resolution with low DNA input. The method builds on the observation that AID/APOBEC family DNA deaminase enzymes can potently discriminate between cytosine modification states and exploits the non-destructive nature of enzymatic, rather than chemical, deamination. ACE-seq yielded high-confidence 5hmC profiles with at least 1,000-fold less DNA input than conventional methods. Applying ACE-seq to generate a base-resolution map of 5hmC in tissue-derived cortical excitatory neurons, we found that 5hmC was almost entirely confined to CG dinucleotides. The whole-genome map permitted cytosine, 5-methylcytosine (5mC) and 5hmC to be parsed and revealed genomic features that diverged from global patterns, including enhancers and imprinting control regions with high and low 5hmC/5mC ratios, respectively. Enzymatic deamination overcomes many challenges posed by bisulfite-based methods, thus expanding the scope of epigenome profiling to include scarce samples and opening new lines of inquiry regarding the role of cytosine modifications in genome biology."
https://openalex.org/W2895154757,"Correlated neuronal activity at various timescales plays an important role in information transfer and processing. We find that in awake-behaving mice, an unexpectedly large fraction of neighboring Purkinje cells (PCs) exhibit sub-millisecond synchrony. Correlated firing usually arises from chemical or electrical synapses, but, surprisingly, neither is required to generate PC synchrony. We therefore assessed ephaptic coupling, a mechanism in which neurons communicate via extracellular electrical signals. In the neocortex, ephaptic signals from many neurons summate to entrain spiking on slow timescales, but extracellular signals from individual cells are thought to be too small to synchronize firing. Here we find that a single PC generates sufficiently large extracellular potentials to open sodium channels in nearby PC axons. Rapid synchronization is made possible because ephaptic signals generated by PCs peak during the rising phase of action potentials. These findings show that ephaptic coupling contributes to the prevalent synchronization of nearby PCs."
https://openalex.org/W2895654827,"Oxytocin is an important neuromodulator in the mammalian brain that increases information salience and circuit plasticity, but its signaling mechanisms and circuit effect are not fully understood. Here we report robust oxytocinergic modulation of intrinsic properties and circuit operations in hippocampal area CA2, a region of emerging importance for hippocampal function and social behavior. Upon oxytocin receptor activation, CA2 pyramidal cells depolarize and fire bursts of action potentials, a consequence of phospholipase C signaling to modify two separate voltage-dependent ionic processes. A reduction of potassium current carried by KCNQ-based M channels depolarizes the cell; protein kinase C activity attenuates spike rate of rise and overshoot, dampening after-hyperpolarizations. These actions, in concert with activation of fast-spiking interneurons, promote repetitive firing and CA2 bursting; bursting then governs short-term plasticity of CA2 synaptic transmission onto CA1 and, thus, efficacy of information transfer in the hippocampal network."
https://openalex.org/W2951628200,"Animals rely on an internal sense of body position and movement to effectively control motor behavior. This sense of proprioception is mediated by diverse populations of mechanosensory neurons distributed throughout the body. Here, we investigate neural coding of leg proprioception in Drosophila, using in vivo two-photon calcium imaging of proprioceptive sensory neurons during controlled movements of the fly tibia. We found that the axons of leg proprioceptors are organized into distinct functional projections that contain topographic representations of specific kinematic features. Using subclass-specific genetic driver lines, we show that one group of axons encodes tibia position (flexion/extension), another encodes movement direction, and a third encodes bidirectional movement and vibration frequency. Overall, our findings reveal how proprioceptive stimuli from a single leg joint are encoded by a diverse population of sensory neurons, and provide a framework for understanding how proprioceptive feedback signals are used by motor circuits to coordinate the body."
https://openalex.org/W2895056340,"This study describes the pathologic findings and most probable causes of death (CD) of 224 cetaceans stranded along the coastline of the Canary Islands (Spain) over a 7-year period, 2006-2012. Most probable CD, grouped as pathologic categories (PCs), was identified in 208/224 (92.8%) examined animals. Within natural PCs, those associated with good nutritional status represented 70/208 (33.6%), whereas, those associated with significant loss of nutritional status represented 49/208 (23.5%). Fatal intra- and interspecific traumatic interactions were 37/208 (17.8%). Vessel collisions included 24/208 (11.5%). Neonatal/perinatal pathology involved 13/208 (6.2%). Fatal interaction with fishing activities comprised 10/208 (4.8%). Within anthropogenic PCs, foreign body-associated pathology represented 5/208 (2.4%). A CD could not be determined in 16/208 (7.7%) cases. Natural PCs were dominated by infectious and parasitic disease processes. Herein, our results suggest that between 2006 and 2012, in the Canary Islands, direct human activity appeared responsible for 19% of cetaceans deaths, while natural pathologies accounted for 81%. These results, integrating novel findings and published reports, aid in delineating baseline knowledge on cetacean pathology and may be of value to rehabilitators, caregivers, diagnosticians and future conservation policies."
https://openalex.org/W2894908836,"A broad molecular framework of how neural stem cells are specified toward astrocyte fate during brain development has proven elusive. Here we perform comprehensive and integrated transcriptomic and epigenomic analyses to delineate gene regulatory programs that drive the developmental trajectory from mouse embryonic stem cells to astrocytes. We report molecularly distinct phases of astrogliogenesis that exhibit stage- and lineage-specific transcriptomic and epigenetic signatures with unique primed and active chromatin regions, thereby revealing regulatory elements and transcriptional programs underlying astrocyte generation and maturation. By searching for transcription factors that function at these elements, we identified NFIA and ATF3 as drivers of astrocyte differentiation from neural precursor cells while RUNX2 promotes astrocyte maturation. These transcription factors facilitate stage-specific gene expression programs by switching the chromatin state of their target regulatory elements from primed to active. Altogether, these findings provide integrated insights into the genetic and epigenetic mechanisms steering the trajectory of astrogliogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2895138395,"Pyramidal neuron dendrites integrate synaptic input from multiple partners. Different inputs converging on the same dendrite have distinct structural and functional features, but the molecular mechanisms organizing input-specific properties are poorly understood. We identify the orphan receptor GPR158 as a binding partner for the heparan sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG) glypican 4 (GPC4). GPC4 is enriched on hippocampal granule cell axons (mossy fibers), whereas postsynaptic GPR158 is restricted to the proximal segment of CA3 apical dendrites receiving mossy fiber input. GPR158-induced presynaptic differentiation in contacting axons requires cell-surface GPC4 and the co-receptor LAR. Loss of GPR158 increases mossy fiber synapse density but disrupts bouton morphology, impairs ultrastructural organization of active zone and postsynaptic density, and reduces synaptic strength of this connection, while adjacent inputs on the same dendrite are unaffected. Our work identifies an input-specific HSPG-GPR158 interaction that selectively organizes synaptic architecture and function of developing mossy fiber-CA3 synapses in the hippocampus."
https://openalex.org/W2897038813,"Basal forebrain cholinergic neurons mature in adolescence coinciding with development of adult cognitive function. Preclinical studies using the rodent model of adolescent intermittent ethanol (AIE; 5.0 g/kg, i.g., 2-days on/2-days off from postnatal day [P]25 to P55) reveal persistent increases of brain neuroimmune genes that are associated with cognitive dysfunction. Adolescent intermittent ethanol exposure also reduces basal forebrain expression of choline acetyltransferase (ChAT), an enzyme critical for acetylcholine synthesis in cholinergic neurons similar to findings in the post-mortem human alcoholic basal forebrain. We report here that AIE decreases basal forebrain ChAT+IR neurons in both adult female and male Wistar rats following early or late adolescent ethanol exposure. In addition, we find reductions in ChAT+IR somal size as well as the expression of the high-affinity nerve growth factor (NGF) receptor tropomyosin receptor kinase A (TrkA) and the low-affinity NGF receptor p75NTR, both of which are expressed on cholinergic neurons. The decrease in cholinergic neuron marker expression was accompanied by increased phosphorylation of NF-κB p65 (pNF-κB p65) consistent with increased neuroimmune signaling. Voluntary wheel running from P24 to P80 prevented AIE-induced cholinergic neuron shrinkage and loss of cholinergic neuron markers (i.e., ChAT, TrkA, and p75NTR) as well as the increase of pNF-κB p65 in the adult basal forebrain. Administration of the anti-inflammatory drug indomethacin (4.0 mg/kg, i.p prior to each ethanol exposure) during AIE also prevented the loss of basal forebrain cholinergic markers and the concomitant increase of pNF-κB p65. In contrast, treatment with the proinflammatory immune activator lipopolysaccharide (1.0 mg/kg, i.p. on P70) caused a loss of cholinergic neuron markers that was paralleled by increased pNF-κB p65 in the basal forebrain. These novel findings are consistent with AIE causing lasting activation of the neuroimmune system that contributes to the persistent loss of basal forebrain cholinergic neurons in adulthood."
https://openalex.org/W2894969280,"Although chronic gastrointestinal dysmotility syndromes are a common worldwide health problem, underlying causes for these disorders are poorly understood. We show that flavivirus infection of enteric neurons leads to acute neuronal injury and cell death, inflammation, bowel dilation, and slowing of intestinal transit in mice. Flavivirus-primed CD8+ T cells promote these phenotypes, as their absence diminished enteric neuron injury and intestinal transit delays, and their adoptive transfer reestablished dysmotility after flavivirus infection. Remarkably, mice surviving acute flavivirus infection developed chronic gastrointestinal dysmotility that was exacerbated by immunization with an unrelated alphavirus vaccine or exposure to a non-infectious inflammatory stimulus. This model of chronic post-infectious gastrointestinal dysmotility in mice suggests that viral infections with tropism for enteric neurons and the ensuing immune response might contribute to the development of bowel motility disorders in humans. These results suggest an opportunity for unique approaches to diagnosis and therapy of gastrointestinal dysmotility syndromes."
https://openalex.org/W2802844983,"Eating out of home (OH) is increasingly popular in Balkan countries, among them Albania. To date there is only anecdotal evidence regarding nutritional quality of food consumed OH and the contribution to diet. This study assessed intake of foods and drinks consumed OH and at home (AH), as well as their nutritional contribution to the daily diet of university students in Tirana, Albania. Using a single day Automated Multiple Pass Method (AMPM) 24-hour dietary recall, we examined food intake among 289 students aged 18–24 years old, from three major universities in Albania. Contribution of eating OH to total energy intake per day, as well as to daily consumption of macronutrients by eating OH intensity tertiles were assessed. Foods and drinks consumed OH contributed 46.9% [95%CI:41.4–52.8] of total daily energy intake, representing, on average, 1169.1kcal [95%CI:1088.3–1249.9]. Sweets, soft drinks and meat products were more frequently consumed OH, while fruits and vegetables consumption was extremely low. The average quantity of sugars and dietary fats per day was higher AH, 76.9g [95%CI:70.3–83.5] and 173.7g [95%CI:163.2–184.2] respectively, compared to OH, 33.7g [95%CI:30.4–37.0] and 142.0g [95%CI:131.5–152.5] respectively. Dietary composition of AH intake was richer in sugars, total fats and proteins, while OH intake was richer in saturated fats. The overall diet appeared unhealthy, when nutrients were assessed as energy percentage against WHO proposed nutrient standards for sugar and saturated fats. Eating OH, even though was associated with lower fruits and vegetables intake, was not clearly associated with poor diet quality, as AH foods were also characterized by increased saturated fats and sugars intake as energy percentage. This study provides data on the first assessment of current dietary patterns of the studied population and can be used as baseline for designing and conducting future studies and interventions targeting malnutrition in all its forms."
https://openalex.org/W2895471159,"Accumulating evidence indicates that non-coding RNAs including microRNAs (miRs) and long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are aberrantly expressed in cancer, providing promising biomarkers for diagnosis, prognosis and/or therapeutic targets. We aimed in the current work to quantify the expression profile of miR-34a and one of its bioinformatically selected partner lncRNA growth arrest-specific 5 (GAS5) in a sample of Egyptian cancer patients, including three prevalent types of cancer in our region; renal cell carcinoma (RCC), glioblastoma (GB), and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) as well as to correlate these expression profiles with the available clinicopathological data in an attempt to clarify their roles in cancer. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis was applied. Different bioinformatics databases were searched to confirm the potential miRNAs-lncRNA interactions of the selected ncRNAs in cancer pathogenesis. The tumor suppressor lncRNA GAS5 was significantly under-expressed in the three types of cancer [0.08 (0.006-0.38) in RCC, p <0.001; 0.10 (0.003-0.89) in GB, p < 0.001; and 0.12 (0.015-0.74) in HCC, p < 0.001]. However, levels of miR-34a greatly varied according to the tumor type; it displayed an increased expression in RCC [4.05 (1.003-22.69), p <0.001] and a decreased expression in GB [0.35 (0.04-0.95), p <0.001]. Consistent to the computationally predicted miRNA-lncRNA interaction, negative correlations were observed between levels of GAS5 and miR-34a in RCC samples (r = -0.949, p < 0.001), GB (r = -0.518, p < 0.001) and HCC (r = -0.455, p = 0.013). Kaplan-Meier curve analysis revealed that RCC patients with down-regulated miR-34a levels had significantly poor overall survival than their corresponding (p < 0.05). Hierarchical clustering analysis showed RCC patients could be clustered by GAS5 and miR-34a co-expression profile. Our results suggest potential applicability of GAS5 and miR-34a with other conventional markers for various types of cancer. Further functional validation studies are warranted to confirm miR-34a/GAS5 interplay in cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2897026858,"Background Globally, preterm birth (PTB) and low infant birth weight (LBW) are leading causes of maternal and child morbidity and mortality. Inadequate water and sanitation access (WASH) are risk factors for PTB and LBW in low-income countries. Physical stress from carrying water and psychosocial stress from addressing sanitation needs in the open may be mechanisms underlying these associations. If so, then living in a community with strong social capital should be able to buffer the adverse effects of WASH on birth outcomes. The objective of this study is to assess the relationships between WASH access and social conditions (including harassment and social capital) on PTB and LBW outcomes among Indian women, and to test whether social conditions modified the association between WASH and birth outcomes. Methods and findings This cohort study examined the effect of pre-birth WASH and social conditions on self-reported PTB status and LBW status for 7,926 women who gave birth between 2004/2005 and 2011/2012 Waves of the India Human Development Survey. PTB and LBW occurred in 14.9% and 15.5% of women, respectively. After adjusting for maternal biological and socioeconomic conditions, PTB was associated with sharing a building/compound latrine (Odds Ratio (OR) = 1.55; 95% Confidence Interval (CI) = 1.01, 2.38) versus private latrine access, but suggested an effect in the opposite direction for sharing a community/public latrine (OR = 0.67; CI = 0.45, 1.01). Open defecation, type of drinking water source, minutes per day spent fetching water, and one-way time to a drinking water source were not associated with PTB. LBW was associated with spending more than two hours per day fetching water compared to less than two hours (OR = 1.33; CI = 1.05, 1.70) and suggested an association with open defecation (OR = 1.22; CI = 1.00, 1.48), but was not associated with other types of sanitation, type of drinking water source, or time to a drinking water source. Harassment of women and girls in the community was associated with both PTB (OR = 1.33; CI = 1.09, 1.62) and LBW (OR = 1.26; CI = 1.03, 1.54). The data also showed a possible association of local crime with LBW (OR = 1.30; CI = 1.00, 1.68). Statistically significant (p<0.05) evidence of effect modification was only found for collective efficacy on the association between type of sanitation access and PTB. In addition, stratified analyses identified differences in effect size for walking time to the primary drinking water source and PTB by crime, sanitation access and PTB by harassment, and total hours per day fetching water and LBW by collective efficacy. Limitations of this observational study include risk of bias, inability to confirm causality, reliance on self-reported outcomes, and limited sub-group sample sizes for testing effect modification. Conclusions The relationship between adverse birth outcomes and sanitation access, domestic water fetching, crime, and gender-based harassment suggests physical and psychosocial stress are possible mechanisms by which WASH access affects PTB and LBW among Indian women. Interventions that reduce domestic responsibilities related to water and sanitation and change social norms related to gender-based harassment may reduce rates of PTB and LBW in India."
https://openalex.org/W2893048038,"Flavonoids are important polyphenolic natural products, ubiquitous in land plants, that play diverse functions in plants' survival in their ecological niches, including UV protection, pigmentation for attracting pollinators, symbiotic nitrogen fixation, and defense against herbivores. Chalcone synthase (CHS) catalyzes the first committed step in plant flavonoid biosynthesis and is highly conserved in all land plants. In several previously reported crystal structures of CHSs from flowering plants, the catalytic cysteine is oxidized to sulfinic acid, indicating enhanced nucleophilicity in this residue associated with its increased susceptibility to oxidation. In this study, we report a set of new crystal structures of CHSs representing all five major lineages of land plants (bryophytes, lycophytes, monilophytes, gymnosperms, and angiosperms), spanning 500 million years of evolution. We reveal that the structures of CHS from a lycophyte and a moss species preserve the catalytic cysteine in a reduced state, in contrast to the cysteine sulfinic acid seen in all euphyllophyte CHS structures. In vivo complementation, in vitro biochemical and mutagenesis analyses, and molecular dynamics simulations identified a set of residues that differ between basal-plant and euphyllophyte CHSs and modulate catalytic cysteine reactivity. We propose that the CHS active-site environment has evolved in euphyllophytes to further enhance the nucleophilicity of the catalytic cysteine since the divergence of euphyllophytes from other vascular plant lineages 400 million years ago. These changes in CHS could have contributed to the diversification of flavonoid biosynthesis in euphyllophytes, which in turn contributed to their dominance in terrestrial ecosystems.

These changes in CHS could have contributed to the diversification of flavonoid biosynthesis in euphyllophytes, which in turn contributed to their dominance in terrestrial ecosystems. In their transition from aquatic domains to terrestrial environments, early land plants faced several major challenges, including exposure to damaging UV-B radiation once screened by aquatic environments, lack of structural support once provided by buoyancy in water, drought, and novel pathogens and herbivores. To cope with many of these stresses, land plants have evolved a series of specialized metabolic pathways, among which phenylpropanoid metabolism was probably one of the most critical soon after the transition from water to land (1Weng J.-K. Chapple C. The origin and evolution of lignin biosynthesis.New Phytol. 2010; 187 (20642725): 273-28510.1111/j.1469-8137.2010.03327.xCrossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar). Flavonoids are a diverse class of plant phenolic compounds found in all extant land plants, with important roles in many aspects of plant life, including UV protection, pigmentation for attracting pollinators and seed dispersers, defense, and signaling between plants and microbes (2Winkel-Shirley B. Flavonoid biosynthesis. A colorful model for genetics, biochemistry, cell biology, and biotechnology.Plant Physiol. 2001; 126 (11402179): 485-49310.1104/pp.126.2.485Crossref PubMed Scopus (2504) Google Scholar). Some flavonoids are also of great interest for their anti-cancer and antioxidant activities as well as other potential health benefits to humans (3Yao L.H. Jiang Y.M. Shi J. Tomás-Barberán F.A. Datta N. Singanusong R. Chen S.S. Flavonoids in food and their health benefits.Plant Foods Hum.

After the core flavonoid biosynthetic pathway was established in early land plants, new branches of the pathway continued to evolve over the history of plant evolution, producing structurally and functionally diverse flavonoids to cope with changing habitats, co-evolving pathogens and herbivores, and other aspects of plants' ecological niches. Basal bryophytes biosynthesize the three main classes of flavonoids, namely flavanones, flavones, and flavonols, which likely emerged as UV sunscreens (4Rausher M.D. Grotewold E. The Science of Flavonoids. Springer, New York2006: 175-211Crossref Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The lycophyte Selaginella biosynthesizes a rich diversity of biflavonoids, many of which were shown to be cytotoxic and may function as phytoalexins (5Weng J.-K. Noel J.P.

Plant Sci. 2013; 4 (23717312): 119Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The ability to synthesize the astringent, polyphenolic tannins, which defend against bacterial and fungal pathogens, seems to have evolved in euphyllophytes (4Rausher M.D. Grotewold E. The Science of Flavonoids. Springer, New York2006: 175-211Crossref Scopus (106) Google Scholar).

Structure–function analyses of plant type III polyketide synthases.Methods Enzymol. 2012; 515 (22999180): 317-33510.1016/B978-0-12-394290-6.00014-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The proposed catalytic mechanism of CHS involves loading of the starter molecule p-coumaroyl-CoA onto the catalytic cysteine, which also serves as the attachment site of the growing polyketide chain during the iterative elongation steps (7Austin M.B. Noel J.P. The chalcone synthase superfamily of type III polyketide synthases.Nat. Prod. Rep. 2003; 20 (12636085): 79-11010.1039/b100917fCrossref PubMed Scopus (732) Google Scholar). This initial reaction step requires the cysteine to be present as a thiolate anion before loading of the starter molecule (Fig. 1B). Using thiol-specific inactivation and the pH dependence of the malonyl-CoA decarboxylation reaction, the pKa of the catalytic cysteine (Cys-164) of Medicago sativa CHS (MsCHS) was measured to be 5.5, a value significantly lower than 8.7 for free cysteine (8Jez J.M.

Interestingly, we observed that the catalytic cysteine residues in the previously reported MsCHS crystal structures appear to be oxidized to sulfinic acid (PDB codes 1BI5 and 1BQ6) (11Ferrer J.L.

Furthermore, the same phenomenon was observed in the crystal structures for several other plant type III PKSs evolutionarily derived from CHS, including Gerbera hybrida 2-pyrone synthase (PDB code 1QLV) (Fig. S1) (9Jez J.M.

The other noncatalytic cysteines in these proteins do not appear to be oxidized. These findings suggest that the oxidation of the catalytic cysteine observed in several type III PKS crystal structures may not simply be an artifact of X-ray crystallography but rather reflects the intrinsic redox potential and reactivity of the catalytic cysteine evolved in this family of enzymes. Indeed, the propensity for a particular cysteine residue to undergo oxidation has been previously indicated to correlate with a low pKa (10Reddie K.G. Carroll K.S. Expanding the functional diversity of proteins through cysteine oxidation.Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2008; 12 (18804173): 746-75410.1016/j.cbpa.2008.07.028Crossref PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar). Here, we present a set of new crystal structures of orthologous CHSs representing five major lineages of land plants, namely bryophytes, lycophytes, monilophytes, gymnosperms, and angiosperms, spanning 500 million years of land plant evolution. Through comparative structural analysis, in vivo complementation, in vitro biochemistry, mutagenesis studies, and molecular dynamics simulations, we reveal that CHSs of basal land plants, i.e. bryophytes and lycophytes, contain a catalytic cysteine less reactive than that of the CHSs from higher plants, i.e. euphyllophytes. We probe into the structure–function relationship of a set of residues that modulate the reactivity of the catalytic cysteine, which leads us to propose that euphyllophytes may have evolved a more catalytically efficient CHS to enhance flavonoid biosynthesis relative to their basal-plant relatives. To examine the structural basis for the evolution of CHS across major land plant lineages, we cloned, expressed, and solved the crystal structures of the five CHS orthologs from the bryophyte Physcomitrella patens (PpCHS), the lycophyte Selaginella moellendorffii (SmCHS), the monilophyte Equisetum arvense (EaCHS), the gymnosperm Pinus sylvestris (PsCHS), and the angiosperm Arabidopsis thaliana (AtCHS) (Fig. 2 and Table 1). Like previously reported crystal structures of type III polyketide synthases, all five CHS orthologs form symmetric homodimers and share the same αβαβα thiolase fold, suggesting a common evolutionary origin (11Ferrer J.L. Jez J.M. Bowman M.E. Dixon R.A. Noel J.P. Structure of chalcone synthase and the molecular basis of plant polyketide biosynthesis.Nat. Struct.

The catalytic triad of cysteine, histidine, and asparagine is found in a highly similar conformation to other PKS and related fatty acid biosynthetic β-ketoacyl-(acyl-carrier-protein) synthase III (KAS III) enzymes, suggesting that they share a similar general catalytic mechanism (Fig. 2B).Table 1Crystallographic data collection and refinement statistics for the five wildtype CHSsPpCHSSmCHSEaCHSPsCHSAtCHSPDB codes6DX76DX86DX96DXA6DXBData collectionTotal reflections161,385 (13,620)493,910 (50,217)1,164,176 (116,600)168,567 (13,442)430,437 (39,846)Unique reflections82,406 (7763)81,737 (6434)125,911 (12,431)46,489 (4596)227,280 (21,992)Multiplicity2.0 (1.8)6.0 (6.2)9.2 (9.4)3.6 (2.9)1.9 (1.8)Completeness (%)98.95 (94.60)90.60 (79.18)99.97 (99.90)99.31 (98.75)98.48 (95.43)Mean I/σ(I)14.31 (1.57)12.32 (1.62)13.26 (1.35)10.40 (2.62)10.17 (2.78)R-merge0.03961 (0.4442)0.1427 (1.194)0.1013 (1.58)0.1424 (0.6168)0.04372 (0.2437)CC1/20.998 (0.747)0.995 (0.51)0.998 (0.697)0.979 (0.406)0.996 (0.837)RefinementResolution range (Å)36.24–2.61 (2.703–2.61)39.01–1.7 (1.761–1.7)56.57–1.5 (1.554–1.5)52.45–2.01 (2.082–2.01)38.68–1.549 (1.604–1.549)Space groupP 2 21 21P 1 21 1P 21 21 21P 1 21 1P 1 21 1Unit cell (Å)71.6 192.83 195.5155.1702 66.6703 102.5552.954 112.764 130.80358.017 100.059 65.88254.64 137.56 108.56Unit cell (°)90 90 9090 91.35 9090 90 9090 110.807 9090 95.59 90R-work0.1810 (0.3187)0.1927 (0.3111)0.1610 (0.4374)0.1591 (0.2512)0.1416 (0.1967)R-free0.2627 (0.3951)0.2362 (0.3567)0.1796 (0.4500)0.2204 (0.3189)0.1640 (0.2151)Non-hydrogen protein atoms17,59257766054600512,052Water molecules595497116841680RMSD bonds (Å)0.0140.0120.0090.0120.009RMSD angles (°)1.51.321.261.311.27Ramachandran favored (%)94.0797.7497.896.7597.91Ramachandran allowed (%)5.581.992.23.252.09Ramachandran outliers (%)0.350.27000Average B-factor63.6122.2420.7917.917.52 Open table in a new tab Based on the previously proposed reaction mechanism for MsCHS, the catalytic cysteine is Cys-169 in AtCHS and Cys-159 in SmCHS. This residue initiates the reaction mechanism by performing nucleophilic attack on p-coumaroyl-CoA (Fig. 1B). The other two members of the catalytic triad consist of His-309 and Asn-342 in AtCHS, and His-302 and Asn-335 in SmCHS. The catalytic histidine contributes to the lowered pKa of the catalytic cysteine by forming a stable imidazolium–thiolate ion pair (8Jez J.M. Noel J.P. Mechanism of chalcone synthase: pKa of the catalytic cysteine and the role of the conserved histidine in a plant polyketide synthase.J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275 (11006298): 39640-3964610.1074/jbc.M008569200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The histidine and asparagine also form the oxyanion hole that stabilizes the tetrahedral transition states formed during the initial nucleophilic attack by cysteine on p-coumaroyl-CoA and after malonyl-CoA decarboxylation (Fig. 1B). Notably, SmCHS and PpCHS are the first CHSs for which a reduced catalytic cysteine has been observed in the crystal structure (Fig. 2B). The catalytic cysteine in SmCHS can still become oxidized to sulfenic acid when the crystal is soaked in hydrogen peroxide, indicating that it is still susceptible to oxidation at a lower rate (Fig. S2 and Table S1). Like most other euphyllophyte type III PKS crystal structures solved to date, AtCHS, PsCHS, and EaCHS contain doubly oxidized catalytic cysteine sulfinic acid (Fig. 2B). This interesting observation suggests a functional divide between basal- plant and euphyllophyte CHSs. Despite shared orthology, the redox potential of the catalytic cysteine in PpCHS and SmCHS may differ from that of the euphyllophyte CHSs, resulting in different levels of sensitivity to oxidation under similar crystallization conditions. This could be due to the evolution of some novel molecular features in euphyllophyte CHSs not present in the lower-plant CHSs. CHS orthologs have been identified in all land-plant species sequenced to date, suggesting a highly conserved biochemical function. To test whether the five CHSs from the five major plant lineages are functionally equivalent, we generated transgenic A. thaliana lines expressing each of the five different CHSs driven by the Arabidopsis CHS promoter in the CHS-null mutant transparent testa 4-2 (tt4-2) background (12Shirley B.W. Kubasek W.L. Storz G. Bruggemann E. Koornneef M. Ausubel F.M. Goodman H.M. Analysis of Arabidopsis mutants deficient in flavonoid biosynthesis.Plant J. 1995; 8 (8528278): 659-67110.1046/j.1365-313X.1995.08050659.xCrossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar) (Fig. S3). Twenty independent T1 plants were selected for each construct. The phenotypes of the transgenic plants described below were represented by the majority of independent transgenic events for each unique construct. As the name indicates, the tt4-2 mutant is devoid of flavonoid biosynthesis and therefore lacks the accumulation of the brown condensed tannin pigments in seed coats, revealing the pale yellow color of the underlying cotyledons (12Shirley B.W. Kubasek W.L. Storz G. Bruggemann E. Koornneef M. Ausubel F.M. Goodman H.M. Analysis of Arabidopsis mutants deficient in flavonoid biosynthesis.Plant J. 1995; 8 (8528278): 659-67110.1046/j.1365-313X.1995.08050659.xCrossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar). Although AtCHS, PsCHS, and EaCHS fully complement the tt phenotype of tt4-2, PpCHS and SmCHS only partially rescue the seed tt phenotype of tt4-2 (Fig. S3), suggesting that PpCHS and SmCHS are likely less active than their higher-plant counterparts in vivo. This result also correlates with the crystallographic observation where the catalytic cysteine of basal-plant and euphyllophyte CHSs exhibits differential susceptibility to oxidation. To perform nucleophilic attack on the p-coumaroyl-CoA substrate, the catalytic cysteine must be present in the thiolate anion form. As shown previously in MsCHS, the pKa of the catalytic cysteine is lowered to 5.5, well below physiological pH, to stabilize this deprotonated state (8Jez J.M. Noel J.P. Mechanism of chalcone synthase: pKa of the catalytic cysteine and the role of the conserved histidine in a plant polyketide synthase.J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275 (11006298): 39640-3964610.1074/jbc.M008569200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Two factors could contribute to the depressed pKa of Cys-164. First, His-303, one of the catalytic triad of CHS in the vicinity of Cys-164, provides an ionic interaction with Cys-164 that can further stabilize the cysteine thiolate anion. Second, Cys-164 is positioned at the N terminus of the MsCHS α-9 helix (11Ferrer J.L. Jez J.M. Bowman M.E. Dixon R.A. Noel J.P. Structure of chalcone synthase and the molecular basis of plant polyketide biosynthesis.Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6 (10426957): 775-78410.1038/11553Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar), which provides a stabilizing effect on the cysteine thiolate anion through the partial positive charge of the helix dipole (13Kortemme T. Creighton T.E. Ionisation of cysteine residues at the termini of model α-helical peptides. Relevance to unusual thiol pKa values in proteins of the thioredoxin family.J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 253 (7473753): 799-81210.1006/jmbi.1995.0592Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). The acidic pKa of the catalytic cysteine in CHS ensures the presence of a cysteine thiolate anion in the enzyme active site at physiological pH to serve as the nucleophile for starter molecule loading. To measure the pKa of the catalytic cysteine in the five land-plant CHS orthologs, we performed pH-dependent inactivation of CHS using iodoacetamide, a thiol-specific compound that reacts with sulfhydryl groups that are sufficiently nucleophilic, followed by a CHS activity assay at the usual reaction pH. At pH values above the pKa, the catalytic cysteine is deprotonated and able to react with iodoacetamide, thus inactivating CHS. At pH values below the pKa, the catalytic cysteine is protonated and protected from iodoacetamide modification, thus retaining CHS activity in the subsequent enzyme assay. The amount of CHS activity remaining after iodoacetamide treatment was expressed as a ratio compared with the CHS activity of a control treatment at the same pH but without iodoacetamide. The pKa value was calculated using nonlinear regression to fit a log(inhibitor) versus response equation, which gave the pH at which 50% of maximal inhibition was obtained. The pKa value for AtCHS was measured to be 5.428, which is close to the 5.5 measured for MsCHS (Fig. 3A). The pKa value for SmCHS was measured to be 6.468, ∼1 pH unit higher than that of the two angiosperm CHS orthologs. This elevated pKa value measured for SmCHS is consistent with the observation of a catalytic cysteine that is less reactive and less prone to oxidation. Also consistent with the crystallographic and plant complementation results, pKa values around 5.5 were measured for euphyllophyte orthologs PsCHS and EaCHS and around 6.5 for the basal-plant orthologs PpCHS (Fig. S4). We next examined the sequence and structural differences between basal-plant and euphyllophyte CHSs that could play a role in modulating catalytic cysteine reactivity. This led us to first identifying a residue near the active site that is conserved as Cys-347 (AtCHS numbering) in AtCHS and other euphyllophyte sequences, and as Ser-340 (SmCHS numbering) in SmCHS and other lycophyte and bryophyte sequences (Fig. 2A). To investigate the role of this residue in modulating catalytic cysteine reactivity, we generated the reciprocal mutations in SmCHS and AtCHS, respectively, and first characterized these mutant proteins using X-ray crystallography (Fig. 3B and Table 2). Under identical crystallization conditions as WT SmCHS, the SmCHS S340C mutant exhibits a partially oxidized catalytic cysteine in its crystal structure, suggesting that the residue does play some role in determining cysteine reactivity. The AtCHS C347S mutant, however, still retains an oxidized catalytic cysteine in its crystal structure.Table 2Crystallographic data collection and refinement statistics for the three mutant CHSsSmCHS S340CAtCHS C347SAtCHS M7PDB ID6DXC6DXD6DXEData collectionTotal reflections185,024 (12,834)368,273 (17,370)293,345 (28,831)Unique reflections105,252 (8805)201,521 (14,085)102,276 (7995)Multiplicity1.8 (1.5)1.8 (1.2)2.9 (2.8)Completeness (%)95.55 (80.52)93.32 (65.39)91.60 (76.72)Mean I/σ(I)9.66 (3.06)8.04 (1.51)11.10 (1.18)R-merge0.04892 (0.1642)0.05533 (0.3447)0.04526 (0.5779)CC1/20.983 (0.891)0.994 (0.699)0.999 (0.778)RefinementResolution range (Å)30.48–1.54 (1.595–1.54)32.92–1.59 (1.647–1.59)60.11–1.608 (1.665–1.608)Space groupP 1 21 1P 1 21 1P 1 21 1Unit cell (Å)55.22 66.38 10354.86 138.22 108.972.8 55.9 100.21Unit cell (°)90 91.73 9090 95.73 9090 92.51 90R-work0.1427 (0.1925)0.1455 (0.2608)0.1721 (0.2610)R-free0.1725 (0.2471)0.1688 (0.2982)0.2023 (0.2675)Nonhydrogen protein atoms580012,0286058Water molecules8811825859RMSD bonds (Å)0.010.010.01RMSD angles (°)1.381.391.27Ramachandran favored (%)97.7297.9297.79Ramachandran allowed (%)2.282.022.08Ramachandran outliers (%)00.070.13Average B-factor16.5220.7821.36 Open table in a new tab We then measured the pKa value of the catalytic cysteine in both SmCHS S340C and AtCHS C347S mutants (Fig. 3C). The pKa value for SmCHS S340C decreases by about 0.25 pH units compared with WT SmCHS, consistent with the observation that the SmCHS S340C crystal structure contained a partially oxidized catalytic cysteine. The pKa value for AtCHS C347S decreases by about 0.25 pH units compared with WT AtCHS, also consistent with the observation that the AtCHS C347S crystal structure retained an oxidized catalytic cysteine. Taken together, the crystallographic and pKa measurement results suggest that the reciprocal mutation at this position is not sufficient to act as a simple switch between the active-site environments of euphyllophyte and basal-plant CHSs to modulate catalytic cysteine reactivity. Additional sequence and structural features likely contribute to an active-site environment that lowers the pKa of the catalytic cysteine in AtCHS. To identify these features, we examined a multiple sequence alignment of CHS orthologs from diverse plant species and identified residues that show conserved variations between euphyllophytes and basal-plant lineages (Fig. 4A and Fig. S5). Two residues, Phe-170 and Gly-173 in euphyllophyte CHSs, were found to be substituted as serine and alanine, respectively, in basal-plant lineages. Because of their positions in the α-helix immediately C-terminal to the catalytic Cys-169, we postulated that these two residues could play a role in determining the structure of the helix, which would have an effect on the electronic environment of the active site, due to the helix dipole’s contribution to lowering the catalytic cysteine pKa value (11Ferrer J.L. Jez J.M. Bowman M.E. Dixon R.A. Noel J.P. Structure of chalcone synthase and the molecular basis of plant polyketide biosynthesis.Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6 (10426957): 775-78410.1038/11553Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar). Four additional residues near the active-site opening of CHS were also identified as differentially conserved between euphyllophytes and basal plants. We postulated that these positions might affect the dynamics of the active-site tunnel and solvent access to the active site. The six aforementioned residues were mutated in the SmCHS S340C background to their corresponding residues in AtCHS to generate the SmCHS I54M/S160F/A163G/G203S/A207Q/V258T/S340C septuple mutant, termed SmCHS M7. Likewise, the reciprocal mutations were also made in the AtCHS C347S background to generate AtCHS M7. Compared with SmCHS S340C, the six additional mutations in SmCHS M7 lower the pKa by nearly 0.7 pH units from 6.429 to 5.738 (Fig. 4B). Similarly, the six mutations of AtCHS M7 raise the pKa by almost 1 pH unit from 5.181 to 6.167 compared with AtCHS C347S. Consistent with the pKa observation, the dimeric crystal structure of AtCHS M7 has one monomer with a catalytic cysteine singly oxidized to sulfenic acid and one monomer with a reduced cysteine (Fig. 4C). Sulfenic acid is more reduced than the doubly oxidized sulfinic acid seen in other euphyllophyte crystal structures, indicating that these six mutations decreased the reactivity of the catalytic cysteine. These mutations represent a part of a possible evolutionary path from ancestral basal-plant CHSs toward the stronger pKa-lowering properties of euphyllophyte CHSs. Any further attempts at engineering CHS to fully swap the pKa-lowering properties between AtCHS and SmCHS would likely require different methods of searching for conserved sequence differences, beyond visual observation of structural differences. An analysis of the CHS multiple sequence alignment using ancestral sequence reconstruction with FastML (14Ashkenazy H. Penn O. Doron-Faigenboim A. Cohen O. Cannarozzi G. Zomer O. Pupko T. FastML: a web server for probabilistic reconstruction of ancestral sequences.Nucleic Acids Res. 2012; 40 (22661579): W580-W58410.1093/nar/gks498Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar) identified eight additional positions that are differently conserved between euphyllophytes and basal plants and could affect CHS function based on their position in the CHS crystal structure (Fig. S6). Our crystal structures revealed a correlation between the pKa value of the catalytic cysteine and a set of residues near the active site. To further investigate the mechanisms underlying these conserved differences between euphyllophyte and basal-plant CHSs, we employed molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to examine the interactions between these residues. We first surveyed the potential role of the C347S substitution (AtCHS numbering) in affecting the active-site environment in WT AtCHS and SmCHS (Fig. 5A). In WT AtCHS, where the largest cluster represents 70.3% of all structures sampled in this simulation, the thiol group of Cys-347 points away from the active site and cannot form any stable interaction with the catalytic His-309 (distance 6.5 Å). In contrast, the corresponding Ser-340 in SmCHS is 2.8 Å away from the histidine in the largest cluster, representing 98.7% of all structures sampled in the SmCHS simulation. Next, we determined the inter-residue distances between the ionic pair Cys-169–His-309 as in AtCHS or Cys-159–His-302 as in SmCHS and between residue Cys-347 (AtCHS)/Ser-340 (SmCHS) and the catalytic histidine (Fig. 5B). For the WT SmCHS simulation, we observed a sharp peak at around 2.8 Å between Ser-340 and His-302, reflecting a stable hydrogen bond between the two residues. On the contrary, no such short-distance peak was observed for WT AtCHS. These results suggest that the catalytic histidine is stabilized upon forming a hydrogen bond with Ser-340 in SmCHS, but such an interaction is relatively loose in AtCHS. Similar differences between the other euphyllophyte and basal-plant CHSs are also seen for PsCHS, EaCHS, and PpCHS (Fig. S7). To further investigate the motion of the catalytic histidine in various mutant enzyme active-site environments, we also performed MD simulations of AtCHS C347S, SmCHS S340C, AtCHS M7, and SmCHS M7 (Fig. 5A). The largest cluster sizes were 86.0, 66.6, 96.7, and 71.0%, respectively. Ser-347 and His-309 in AtCHS mutants adopt a similar conformation to the corresponding residues in WT SmCHS. In contrast, no stable hydrogen bond between Cys-340 and His-302 is formed in the largest cluster of the SmCHS mutant simulations. Introducing point mutations dramatically changes the distributions of those key inter-residue distances. In the AtCHS C347S mutant, the Ser-347–His-309 distance dramatical"

This study aimed to elucidate whether ARD is systemic, i.e. whether the contact of parts of the root system with ARD soil causes the whole plant to show poor shoot and root growth. A split-root experiment was conducted with seedlings of ‘M26’, offering the same plant for its root system the choice between the substrates ARD soil (+ARD), γ-sterilized ARD soil (-ARD) or soil from a grass parcel (Control) with the following combinations: +ARD/+ARD, -ARD/-ARD; +ARD/-ARD; +ARD/Control. Root growth was analysed throughout the 34-day growing period. Samples from bulk, rhizosphere and rhizoplane soil were collected separately for each compartment, and analysed by fingerprints of 16S rRNA gene or ITS fragments amplified from total community (TC) DNA. The response of the plant to +ARD was not systemic as root growth in -ARD compartment was always superior to root growth in +ARD soil. Crosswise 15N-labelling of the N-fertilizer applied to the split-root compartments showed that nitrate-N uptake efficiency was higher for roots in -ARD soil compared to those in +ARD. Bacterial and fungal community composition in the rhizoplane and rhizosphere of the same plants differed significantly between the compartments containing +ARD/-ARD or +ARD/Control. The strongest differences between the bacterial fingerprints were observed in the rhizoplane and rhizosphere. Bacterial genera with increased abundance in response to ARD were mainly Streptomyces but also Sphingobium, Novosphingobium, Rhizobium, Lysobacter and Variovorax. The strongest differences between the fungal fingerprints were observed in bulk soil. Our data showed that the response of the apple plant to ARD soil is local and not systemic."

In addition, significant immune mediators were correlated with initial and final visual acuity (VA).Our results demonstrated elevated expression of 16 mediators such as GCSF, GRO, IFN-γ, IL-1α, IL-1β, IL-1 RA, IL-6, IL-8, IP-10, MCP-1, MCP-3, MIP-1α, IL-1β, TGF-α, TNF-α in patients with culture positive endophthalmitis. Cytokine profile expression significantly differed between patients with proven endophthalmitis and the non-infectious controls in heat map analysis. PCoA plot indicated five mediators (IL-1RA, IL-6, IL-8, GRO, G-CSF) as biomarkers that could be Independent Predictors of Disease especially in culture negative cases. Correlation of cytokines with VA revealed strong association between the initial VA and intraocular levels of TGF-α, IL-1β and IL-8 but there was no correlation with the severity or visual outcome of infection.In comparison to non-infectious ocular conditions, the pathogenesis of infectious endophthalmitis correlates with increased expression levels of IL-1RA, IL-6, IL-8, GRO, G-CSF. Understanding cytokine profiles in culture negative endophthalmitis patients could aid in therapy in non-responders to empirical antibiotic therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2895461561,"The brown planthopper (BPH), Nilaparvata lugens, is a serious threat to rice production in Vietnam and insecticides are widely used for its control. Migration of the BPH have one of its roots in tropical Vietnam in the Mekong River Delta and the insecticide resistance status of BPH populations from Vietnam is thus important for East Asia. In the present investigation, we evaluate the susceptibility of BPH populations from nine provinces from the Red River Delta, the Central Coastal region and the Mekong River Delta of eight insecticides during 2015-17. BPH field populations of Vietnam have developed a low to moderate level of resistance to the neonicotinoids dinotefuran, nitenpyram and imidacloprid, the pyrethroid etofenprox, the anticholinesterase fenobucarb, as well as fipronil and pymetrozine, and the growth regulator buprofezin. There was a correlation of in toxicology of fipronil, dinotefuran, etofenprox, buprofezin, which represents four different modes of action. The neonicotinoid nitenpyram, pymetrozine and fenobucarb did not show correlation in toxicology to any of the investigated insecticides. For most insecticides, a gradient of susceptibility was established from the Red River Delta in the north, through the Central Coastal region and to the Mekong River Delta in the south of Vietnam. The most susceptible populations were from the north. Insecticide resistance of the BPH populations in Vietnam is not at an alarming level and they are not the direct origin of high insecticide resistance found in East Asia. The cross-resistance pattern of BPH populations in Vietnam, where insecticides with different modes of action correlated, indicate that insecticides should be used with caution. There could be a buildup of a general metabolic resistance, which alone or in combination with the emergence of target-site resistance mutations will cause control problems. The results will be beneficial for development of resistance management strategies to prevent and delay development of insecticide resistance in BPH not only for Vietnam, but also for more northern Asian regions due the migration of BPH from tropical Vietnam."
https://openalex.org/W2895147595,"Burn patients have a high risk of sepsis-related mortality even after surviving the initial injury. Immunosuppression increases the risk of sepsis after burn injury, as does the disruption of the intestinal epithelial barrier, which allows the translocation of bacteria and bacterial products into the circulation. The integrity of the intestinal epithelial barrier is largely maintained by the intestinal microbiota. Burn injury has been reported to result in significant changes in the intestinal microbiome composition. In this mouse study, we confirm these taxonomic differences in a full-thickness scald injury model using CF-1 mice. For the first time, we also address alterations in functional gene expression of the intestinal microbiota after burn injury to assess the microbiome's physiological capabilities for overgrowth and pathogenic invasion: 38 pathways were differentially abundant between the sham and burn injury mice, including bacterial invasion of epithelial cells and gap- and adherens junction pathways."
https://openalex.org/W2950337984,"Vitamin D functions as a potent immunomodulator by interacting with many immune cells however, its role in regulating inflammation in the epicardial adipose tissue (EAT) is unclear. In the EAT of atherosclerotic microswine that were fed with deficient, sufficient or supplemented levels of vitamin D, we evaluated the phenotype of the macrophages. Vitamin D treatment was continued for 12 months and serum 25(OH)D levels were measured regularly. Infiltration of M1/M2 macrophage was investigated by immunostaining for CCR7 and CD206, respectively in conjunction with a pan macrophage marker CD14. Significant difference in the number of CCR7+ cells was observed in the EAT from vitamin D-deficient swine compared to vitamin D-sufficient or -supplemented swine. Expression of CD206 correlated with high levels of serum 25(OH)D indicating a significant increase in M2 macrophages in the EAT of vitamin D-supplemented compared to -deficient swine. These findings suggest that vitamin D-deficiency exacerbates inflammation by increasing pro-inflammatory M1 macrophages, while vitamin D-supplementation attenuates the inflammatory cytokines and promotes M2 macrophages in EAT. This study demonstrates the significance of vitamin D mediated inhibition of macrophage mediated inflammation in the EAT during coronary intervention in addition to its immunomodulatory role. However, additional studies are required to identify the cellular mechanisms that transduce signals between macrophages and smooth muscle cells during restenosis in the presence and absence of vitamin D."

However, a subset of HPV(+) patients with a smoking history fail to respond to the standard of care treatments such as radiation and chemotherapy. To understand the underlying mechanism driving HPV(+) OPSCC patient resistance to treatment and recurrence, we sought to identify and characterize the differentially expressed miRNAs and their target genes in HPV(+) smokers and non-smokers.MicroRNA expression analysis was performed using Nanostring in tumor tissues isolated from a prospective cohort of HPV(+) smoking (n = 9) and HPV(+) (n = 13) non-smoking OPSCC patients. Identified miRNAs of interest were further validated using qRT-PCR in cigarette smoke extract (CSE) treated HPV(+) and E6/E7 overexpressing HPV(-) cells.In comparison to OPSCC HPV(+) non-smokers, 38 miRNAs were significantly altered in the HPV(+) smoker patients cohort and out of that 9 were downregulated. Altered miRNA expression was also detected in the serum and metastatic lymph nodes of HPV(+) smokers versus non-smokers. Expression of miR-133a-3p was significantly downregulated in OPSCC smokers, HPV(+) cells and E6/E7 overexpressing HPV(-) cells treated with CSE. Reduction of miR-133a-3p induced the upregulation of miR-133a-3p target mRNAs EGFR and HuR.Our results indicate that miR-133a-3p is a target of smoking-induced changes in HPV(+) patients and alters the expression of EGFR and HuR which may promote HPV associated oropharyngeal cancer. Therefore, future treatment strategies for HPV(+) OPSCC smokers should focus on EGFR inhibition and the development of selective therapies to target HuR."

The purpose of this prospective study was to find out whether subjects with cancer were at greater risk of AF than subjects without cancer.The study was based on the OPERA (Oulu Project Elucidating Risk of Atherosclerosis) material and had 1045 subjects and the mean follow-up time of 16.3 years. During the follow-up AF and cancer diagnosis were made (atrial flutter included) if these events were listed in the National Death Registry and/or hospital discharge registry.In this study 130 subjects (12%) had cancer and 19% of these had AF, whereas only 9% of those without cancer experienced AF during the follow-up (p<0.001). Subjects in the cancer group had greater probability of developing atrial fibrillation during the follow-up time in comparison to the subjects without cancer (Hazard ratio (HR) 2.47 (95%CI) 1.57-3.88) in multivariate model including relevant confounding factors.The main finding of this OPERA study was that cancer is an independent risk factor of atrial fibrillation. Still it remains unclear whether this association is causative or whether cancer and atrial fibrillation just share the same pathophysiologic mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W2895221836,"Introduction Cardiac surgery with the use of cardiopulmonary bypass is known to induce distinct metabolic changes. Respective changes in acid-base status including increased systemic lactate levels were previously related to clinical outcomes, but data remain controversial. Therefore, we aim to investigate the relevance of lactate and base excess (BE) levels on ICU-mortality in patients admitted to the ICU after cardiac surgery. Materials and methods Perioperative data of patients treated in a tertiary care academic center admitted to the ICU after on-pump surgery were analyzed in a retrospective fashion. Receiver operation characteristic (ROC) curves were constructed for admission lactate-levels and BE with calculation of optimal cut-off values to predict ICU mortality. Univariate followed by multivariate regression models were constructed to identify potential outcome-relevant indices. Results Data from 1,058 patients were included in the analysis. Area under the curves for prediction of ICU mortality were 0.79 for lactate levels at ICU admission (sensitivity 61.9%/ specificity 87.5%; optimal cut-off level 3.9mmol/l), and 0.7 for BE (sensitivity 52.4%/ specificity 93.8%, optimal cut-off level -6.7), respectively. Multivariate regression identified BE < -6.7 as the single metabolic predictor of ICU-mortality (HR 4.78, 95%-CI 1.4–16.33, p = 0.01). Explorative subgroup analyses revealed that the combination of lactate ≤3.9mmol/l and BE ≤ -6.7 has stronger impact on mortality than a combination of lactate of >3.9mmol/l and BE > -6.7 (HR 2.56, 95%-CI 0.18–37.17). Conclusions At ICU-admission, severely reduced BE appears superior to hyperlactatemia with regard to prediction of ICU-mortality in patients after cardiac surgery."

Based on structural balance, we generalize the evolution of cooperation in signed networks. Here we develop a new simulation model to study the impact of structural balance on the evolution of cooperation in signed networks. The simulation shows that cooperation prevails when an individual has a higher probability of adjusting the signs of its relations. We also find that structural balance forces the coexistence of cooperators and defectors, while the initial attributes of networks have little impact on the evolution of cooperation in the presence of structural balance, although they have a strong effect on the evolution of structural balance."
https://openalex.org/W2895295850,"Phellinus igniarius, which is called Sanghuang in Chinese, is a fungal herb widely used in Traditional Chinese Medicine to treat stomachache, inflammation and tumors. Recent studies have demonstrated the antitumor, anti-diabetic, anti-inflammatory and immunity-modulating activities of P. igniarius. In the present study, we investigated that ameliorating effect of the aqueous extract of P. igniarius fruiting body (SH) on dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced colitis in C57BL/6 mice. Treatment with SH (250 and 400 mg/kg) for 8 weeks effectively alleviated the pathological indicators of colitis such as bodyweight reduction, disease activity index score, shortening of colon length and abnormal colon histology. The plasma levels of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and inflammatory factors such as interleukin-6 (IL-6), IL-1β and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α were all significantly reduced. Supplementation of SH (10 mg/L) also inhibited LPS-elicited IL-1β production by RAW264.7 macrophages. Real-time PCR and western blot showed that treatment with SH significantly inhibited the phosphorylation of nuclear factor kappa B inhibitor alpha (IκBα) and decreased the expression of IL-6/IL-1β-maturation genes such as apoptosis-associated speck-like protein (ASC3) and caspase-1 in the colon of DSS-induced colitis mice. These results suggest that SH is adequate for the treatment of colitis. Inhibiting the expression and release of inflammatory factors may participate in the colitis-ameliorating effect of SH."
https://openalex.org/W2896220946,"Francisella tularensis is an intracellular pathogen causing the disease tularemia, and an organism of concern to biodefence. There is no licensed vaccine available. Subunit approaches have failed to induce protection, which requires both humoral and cellular immune memory responses, and have been hampered by a lack of understanding as to which antigens are immunoprotective. We undertook a preliminary in silico analysis to identify candidate protein antigens. These antigens were then recombinantly expressed and encapsulated into glucan particles (GPs), purified Saccharomyces cerevisiae cell walls composed primarily of β-1,3-glucans. Immunological profiling in the mouse was used to down-selection to seven lead antigens: FTT1043 (Mip), IglC, FTT0814, FTT0438, FTT0071 (GltA), FTT0289, FTT0890 (PilA) prior to transitioning their evaluation to a Fischer 344 rat model for efficacy evaluation. F344 rats were vaccinated with the GP protein antigens co-delivered with GP-loaded with Francisella LPS. Measurement of cell mediated immune responses and computational epitope analysis allowed down-selection to three promising candidates: FTT0438, FTT1043 and FTT0814. Of these, a GP vaccine delivering Francisella LPS and the FTT0814 protein was able to induce protection in rats against an aerosol challenge of F. tularensis SchuS4, and reduced organ colonisation and clinical signs below that which immunisation with a GP-LPS alone vaccine provided. This is the first report of a protein supplementing protection induced by LPS in a Francisella vaccine. This paves the way for developing an effective, safe subunit vaccine for the prevention of inhalational tularemia, and validates the GP platform for vaccine delivery where complex immune responses are required for prevention of infections by intracellular pathogens."
https://openalex.org/W2896420894,"Purpose To find the shortest, acceptable stabilization period before recording resting, supine ultra-short-term Ln RMSSD and heart rate (HR). Method Thirty endurance-trained male athletes (age 24.1 ± 2.3 years, maximal oxygen consumption (VO2max) 64.1 ± 6.6 ml·kg-1·min-1) and 30 male students (age 23.3 ± 1.8 years, VO2max 52.8 ± 5.1 ml·kg-1·min-1) were recruited. Upon awaking at home, resting, supine RR intervals were measured continuously for 10 min using a Polar V800 HR monitor. Ultra-short-term Ln RMSSD and HR values were calculated from 1-min RR interval segments after stabilization periods from 0 to 4 min in 0.5 min increments and were compared with reference values calculated from 5-min segment after 5-min stabilization. Systematic bias and intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) including 90% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated and magnitude based inference was conducted. Results The stabilization periods of up to 30 s for athletes and up to 60 s for students showed positive (possibly to most likely) biases for ultra-short-term Ln RMSSD compared with reference values. Stabilization periods of 60 s for athletes and 90 s for students showed trivial biases and ICCs were 0.84; 90% CI 0.72 to 0.91, and 0.88; 0.79 to 0.94, respectively. For HR, biases were trivial and ICCs were 0.93; 0.88 to 0.96, and 0.93; 0.88 to 0.96, respectively. Conclusion The shortest stabilization period required to stabilize Ln RMSSD and HR was set at 60 s for endurance-trained athletes and 90 s for university students."
https://openalex.org/W2897339207,"Nest predation is an important determinant of reproductive success and ground-nesting birds exhibit a variety of nest defence strategies to mitigate the risk. Many small-bodied, ground nesting birds rely on deceptive behaviours such as injury-feigning to reduce nest predation: we call this behaviour active deception. However, active deception may entail risks to adults, and passive deceptive behaviour, where individuals effectively sneak away from the nest by flushing at long distances, may be an alternative means of avoiding nest predation. We provide a simple model to demonstrate that these tails of the flush distance distribution could minimize predation risk; an intermediate strategy of moderate flush distances means that birds flush more often than with short-distance flushes, and once flushed, the nest is more easily located than for long-distance flushes. We tested this model using two species of ground nesting shorebirds, the White-rumped Sandpiper (Calidris fuscicollis) and the Red Phalarope (Phalaropus fulicarius). We demonstrate that short-distance flushes are associated with active deception and intermediate-distance flushes are associated with an increased risk of nest predation. However, we found no evidence that this potential selective pressure against intermediate strategies has produced a bimodal distribution of nest defence traits. The heritability of defence behaviours, or the ability of individuals to learn, is unknown and other factors such as energetic constraints or risks to adults might also influence flush distances and defence behaviours."
https://openalex.org/W2895489514,"Atrial fibrillation is associated with an atrial cardiomyopathy composed mainly of fibrosis and adipose tissue accumulation. We hypothesized that MRI, when used in an optimal ex vivo setting allowing high spatial resolution without motion artifacts, can help characterizing the complex 3D left atrial (LA) wall composition in human myocardial samples, as compared to histology.This prospective case-control study was approved by the institutional review board. 3D MRI acquisitions including saturation-recovery T1 mapping and DIXON imaging was performed at 4.0 T on 9 human LA samples collected from patients who underwent cardiac surgery. Histological quantification of fibrosis and fat was obtained. MRI T1 maps were clustered based on a Gaussian Mixture Model allowing quantification of total, interstitial and fatty fibrosis components. Fat maps were computed from DIXON images and fat fractions were calculated. MRI measurements were performed on the same location as the histological analysis (plane) and on the entire sample volume (3D).High correlations and levels of agreement were observed between MRI and histology for total (r = 0.93), interstitial (r = 0.93) and fatty fibrosis (r = 0.98) and fat (r = 0.96). Native T1 correlated with the amount of fibrosis from MRI and histology. The 3D MRI total, interstitial and fatty fibrosis ranges were between 6% and 23%, 4% and 17.3%; and 1.4% and 19.7% respectively.High Field ex vivo MRI was able to quantify different LA myocardial components with high agreement in 2D with histology and moreover to provide 3D quantification of such components whereas in vivo application remains a challenge."
https://openalex.org/W2953309063,"Neonicotinoid insecticides have been implicated in the rapid global decline of bumblebees over recent years, particularly in agricultural and urban areas. While there is much known about neonicotinoid toxicity effects at the colony stage of the bumblebee annual cycle, far less is known about such effects at other stages critical for the maintenance of wild populations. In the present work, individual-based feeding assays were used to show that chronic consumption of the widely used neonicotinoid clothianidin at a field-realistic average rate of 3.6 and 4.0 ng/g·bee/day reduces survival of queen and male bumblebees, respectively, within a 7-day period. In contrast, worker survival was unaffected at a similar consumption rate of 3.9 ng/g·bee/day. To test the hypothesis that males have a lower tolerance for oral clothianidin exposure than workers due to their haploid genetic status, RNAseq analysis was used to compare the transcriptomic responses of workers and males to chronic intake of clothianidin at a sub-lethal dose of 0.37ng/bee/day for 5 days. Surprisingly, clothianidin consumption only altered the expression of 19 putative detoxification genes in a sex-specific manner, with 11/19 genes showing increased expression in workers. Sub-lethal clothianidin exposure also altered the expression of 40 genes associated with other major biological functions, including locomotion, reproduction, and immunity. Collectively, these results suggest that chronic oral toxicity effects of neonicotinoids are greatest during mating and nest establishment phases of the bumblebee life cycle. Chronic oral toxicity testing on males and queens is therefore required in order to fully assess the impact of neonicotinoids on wild bumblebee populations."
https://openalex.org/W2895033526,"Many studies have focused on the interactive effects of temperature increases due to global warming and nutrient enrichment on phytoplankton communities. Recently, non-temperature effects of climate change (e.g., decreases in wind speed and increases in solar radiation) on large lakes have received increasing attention. To evaluate the relative contributions of both temperature and non-temperature effects on phytoplankton communities in a large eutrophic subtropical shallow lake, we analyzed long-term monitoring data from Lake Taihu, China from 1997 to 2016. Results showed that Lake Taihu’s spring phytoplankton biovolume and composition changed dramatically over this time frame, with a change in dominant species. Stepwise multiple linear regression models indicated that spring phytoplankton biovolume was strongly influenced by total phosphorus (TP), light condition, wind speed and total nitrogen (TN) (radj2 = 0.8, p < 0.01). Partial redundancy analysis (pRDA) showed that light condition accounted for the greatest variation of phytoplankton community composition, followed by TP and wind speed, as well as the interactions between TP and wind speed. Our study points to the additional importance of non-temperature effects of climate change on phytoplankton community dynamics in Lake Taihu."
https://openalex.org/W2895641359,"MicroRNA (miR)-590-5p has been identified as an important regulator of some signaling pathways such as cell proliferation and tumorigenesis. However, little is known about its role during viral infection. Here, we report that miR-590-5p was significantly induced by various viruses and effectively potentiated virus replication in different viral infection systems. Furthermore, miR-590-5p substantially attenuated the virus-induced expression of type I and type III interferons (IFNs) and inflammatory cytokines, resulting in impaired downstream antiviral signaling. Interleukin-6 receptor (IL6R) was identified as a target of miR-590-5p. Interestingly, the role of miR-590-5p in virus-triggered signaling was abolished in IL6R knockout cells, and this could be rescued by restoring the expression of the soluble IL6R (sIL6R) but not the membrane-bound IL6R (mIL6R), suggesting that sIL6R is indispensable for miR-590-5p in modulating the host antiviral response. Furthermore, miR-590-5p down-regulated endogenous sIL6R and mIL6R expression through a translational repression mechanism. These findings thus uncover a previously uncharacterized role and the underlying mechanism of miR-590-5p in the innate immune response to viral infection."

Monitoring of transmissions of individuals from different age groups could offer information that would be valuable for planning adequate disease control strategies. We compared the age-specific effective reproductive numbers (R) of measles during 2009–2016 in Guangdong, China. Methods We estimated the age-specific R values for 7 age groups: 0–8 months, 9–18 months, 19 months to 6 years, 7–15 years, 16–25 years, 26–45 years, and ≥46 years adapting the contact matrix of China. The daily numbers of laboratory and clinically confirmed cases reported to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention of Guangdong were used. Results The peak R values of the entire population were above unity from 2012 to 2016, indicating the persistence of measles in the population. In general, children aged 0–6 years and adults aged 26–45 years had larger values of R when comparing with other age groups after 2012. While the peaks of R values for children aged 0–6 years dropped steadily after 2013, the peaks of R values for adults aged 26–45 years kept at a high range every year. Conclusions Although the provincial supplementary immunization activities (SIAs) conducted in 2009 and 2010 were able to reduce the transmissions from 2009 to 2011, larger values of R for children aged 0–6 years were observed after 2012, indicating that the benefits of the SIAs were short-lived. In addition, the transmissions from adults aged between 26 and 45 years increased over time. Disease control strategies should target children and adult groups that carry high potential for measles transmission."
https://openalex.org/W2896019834,"Purpose To evaluate the malignancy rate and diagnostic performance of galactography in patients with pathological nipple discharge (PND) after negative clinical breast examination, mammography and ultrasound. Materials and methods We retrospectively evaluated all galactograms obtained between January 2006 and December 2014 in women with PND. Galactographic findings were classified into 6 groups according to a modified Galactogram Image Classification system (GICS) to comply with the breast imaging reporting and data system classification. Observers were blinded to the final histology and clinical outcome at the time of analysis. MRI was performed as a problem solving ancillary examination. Imaging findings, pathological diagnosis and follow-up data were evaluated. The diagnostic performance of MRI and technically successful galactography in the detection of neoplastic or risk lesions were separately calculated. Results A total of 146 patients with PND (mean age, 51.5 years; range, 17–93) were examined. Malignant lesions were detected in only 4 patients (2.7%) and risk-lesions in 5 patients (3.4%). Only one low-grade ductal carcinoma in situ was missed by galactography (GICS 1) and MRI. MRI examinations were performed in 21 (14.4%) patients; one of these patients (4.8%) had a malignant finding (GICS 0), two (9.5%) had risk-lesions (GICS 2 and 5). In the detection of neoplastic or risk lesions the sensitivity and specificity of galactography were 77.4% and 75.7% and of MRI 85.7% and 71.4%, consecutively. Conclusion The malignancy rate is negligible if clinical, mammography, ultrasound and galactography examinations are negative. Galactography remains a practical, valuable and cost-effective examination procedure. If galactography is technically unsuccessful, MRI should be considered as an additional ancillary tool to evaluate the possible etiology of symptoms, but the routine use of MRI in all patients cannot be justified."

The more C-terminal regions of DCX bind several other proteins, including the adhesion receptor neurofascin and clathrin adaptors. We recently identified a role for DCX in endocytosis of neurofascin. The disease-associated DCX-G253D mutant protein is known to be deficient in binding neurofascin, and we now asked if disruption of neurofascin endocytosis underlies the DCX-G253D–associated pathology.

https://openalex.org/W2895172552,"The paper investigates the effect of preferential gathering sites on urban insurgency in an agent-based model (ABM). The ABM model was proposed in earlier work and has been validated using FBI data. There is a nonlinear tradeoff between the local density of citizens due to the number of preferential gathering sites and the ability of law enforcement officers (LEOs) to adequately patrol that leads to a non-monotonic behavior in the number of large scale outburst of insurgency with respect to the number of gathering sites. The inclusion of a moderate number of sites decreases the number of large-scale outbursts. Having no gathering sites or a large number of gathering sites has a dilutive effect on the number of large-scale outbursts. Thus, this non-monotonicity indicates that a small number of organized units produces a larger insurgency effect than a larger number of distributed units. It is also shown, using Koopman mode analysis, that the spatial morphology of agents due to the gathering sites gives rise to temporal organization of the model dynamics; there is a prominent quasi-periodic component in the number of active and intimidated citizens and in the spatial distribution of the LEOs."
https://openalex.org/W2896303483,"A good understanding of species-habitat associations, or habitat use, is required to establish conservation strategies for any species. Many amphibian species are elusive and most information concerning amphibian habitat use comes from breeding sites where they are comparatively easy to find and study. Knowledge about retreat sites is extremely limited for most species and for the greater part of the year. For such species, it is especially important to factor in detection probability in habitat analyses, because otherwise distorted views about habitat preferences may result, e.g., when a species is more visible in habitat type B than in A, even though A may be preferred. The South American red-belly toad, Melanophryniscus pachyrhynus, is a range-restricted species from Southern Brazil and Uruguay that inhabits open areas with rocky outcrops and is usually seen only during explosive breeding events. Here we studied the fine-scale habitat use of the red-belly toad outside of the breeding season to identify retreat sites and test for the importance of accounting for species imperfect detection, using Bayesian occupancy models. We identified shrub density and the number of loose rocks as important predictors of occupancy, while detection probability was highest at intermediate temperatures. Considering the harsh (dry and hot) conditions of rocky outcrops, shrubs and loose rocks may both work as important refuges, besides providing food resources and protecting against predation. Rocky outcrops have been suffering changes in habitat configuration and we identify nonbreeding habitat preferences at a fine scale, which may help to promote population persistence, and highlight the importance of accounting for imperfect detection when studying secretive species."
https://openalex.org/W2895541213,"Under certain conditions, amyloid-like fibrils can develop into three-dimensional networks and form hydrogels by a self-assembly process. When Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD1), an anti-oxidative enzyme, undergoes misfolding, fibrillar aggregates are formed, which are a hallmark of a certain form of familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). However, the issue of whether SOD1 fibrils can be assembled into hydrogels remains to be tested. Here, we show that the SOD1 polypeptides undergo hydrogelation accompanied by the formation of thioflavin T-positive fibrils at pH 3.0 and 4.0, but not at pH 5.0 where precipitates are formed. The results of viscoelastic analyses indicate that the properties of SOD1 hydrogels (2%) were similar to and slightly more fragile than a 0.25% agarose gel. In addition, monitoring by a quartz crystal microbalance with admittance analysis showed that the denaturing of immobilized SOD1 on a sensor under the hydrogelation conditions at pH 3.0 and 4.0 resulted in an increase in the effective acoustic thickness from ~3.3 nm (a folded rigid form) to ~50 and ~100 nm (an extended water-rich state), respectively. In contrast, when SOD1 was denatured under the same conditions at pH 5.0, a compact water-poor state with an effective acoustic thickness of ~10 nm was formed. The addition of physiological concentrations of NaCl to the pH 4.0 sample induced a further extension of the SOD1 with larger amounts of water molecules (with an effective acoustic thickness of ~200 nm) but suppressed hydrogel formation. These results suggest that different denatured intermediate states of the protein before self-assembly play a major role in determining the characteristics of the resulting aggregates and that a conformational change to a suitable level of extended water-rich intermediate state before and/or during intermolecular assembling is required for fibrillation and hydrogelation in the case of globular proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2894587712,"We previously reported association of SCARB1 SNP rs10846744 with common carotid IMT (cIMT) and cardiovascular disease (CVD) events. Since rs10846744 has been reported in association with Lp-PLA2 mass and activity, we hypothesized that inflammatory pathways might mediate the association of rs10846744 with atherosclerosis.We first examined association of rs10846744 in CVD in multiple large-scale consortium-based genome-wide association studies. We further examined 27 parameters of interest, including Lp-PLA2 mass and activity, inflammatory markers, and plasma phospholipid fatty acids, and fatty acid ratios in participants from the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA), as potential mediators in the pathway linking rs10846744 with cIMT and incident CVD. Finally, we examined the association of rs10846744 with Lp-PLA2 activity, cardiovascular outcomes, and interaction with the Lp-PLA2 inhibitor, darapladib, in the Stabilization of Atherosclerotic Plaque by Initiation of Darapladib Therapy (STABILITY) and Stabilization of Plaque using Darapladib-Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction 52 (SOLID-TIMI 52) studies.SCARB1 rs10846744 was associated with coronary artery disease events in CARDIoGRAMplusC4D (odds ratio 1.05; 95% CI [1.02, 1.07]; P = 1.4x10-4). In combined analysis across race/ethnic groups in MESA, rs10846744 was associated with Lp-PLA2 mass (P = 0.04) and activity (P = 0.001), homocysteine (P = 0.03), LDL particle number (P = 0.01), docosahexaenoic acid [DHA] (P = 0.01), docosapentaenoic acid [DPA] (P = 0.04), DPA/ eicosapentaenoic acid [EPA] ratio (P = 0.002), and DHA/EPA ratio (P = 0.008). Lp-PLA2 activity was identified as a mediator of rs10846744 with cIMT in a basic model (P = 8x10-5), but not after adjustment for CVD risk factors. There was no interaction or modifier effect of the Lp-PLA2 inhibitor darapladib assignment on the relationship between rs10846744 and major CVD events in either STABILITY or SOLID-TIMI 52.SCARB1 rs10846744 is significantly associated with Lp-PLA2 activity, atherosclerosis, and CVD events, but Lp-PLA2 activity is not a mediator in the association of rs10846744 with cIMT in MESA."
https://openalex.org/W2896828798,"When we get sick, we want to be resilient and recover our original health. To measure resilience, we need to quantify a host's position along its disease trajectory. Here we present Looper, a computational method to analyze longitudinally gathered datasets and identify gene pairs that form looping trajectories when plotted in the space described by these phases. These loops enable us to track where patients lie on a typical trajectory back to health. We analyzed two publicly available, longitudinal human microarray datasets that describe self-resolving immune responses. Looper identified looping gene pairs expressed by human donor monocytes stimulated by immune elicitors, and in YF17D-vaccinated individuals. Using loops derived from training data, we found that we could predict the time of perturbation in withheld test samples with accuracies of 94% in the human monocyte data, and 65-83% within the same cohort and in two independent cohorts of YF17D vaccinated individuals. We suggest that Looper will be useful in building maps of resilient immune processes across organisms."
https://openalex.org/W2895011190,"We, as humans, have long been fascinated by our history both as individuals and as a species, and questions of personal ancestry are increasingly becoming answerable by the popularization of genetic testing services such as those offered by Ancestry.com and 23andMe. Beyond our individual provenance, however, is the question of the history of humankind, and the relatively recent explosion in the field of ancient DNA research is rising to this challenge. The insights into early human history that can be gleaned from sequencing and careful analysis of ancient genomes are myriad, and 2018 has been rife with exciting discoveries that are illuminating our origin story. The movements of our ancestors over large swaths of time and distance has long been under archaeological inquiry, and a plethora of recent papers are complementing, and occasionally contradicting, knowledge of past human migratory dynamics. Until recently, much of this work was focused on the movement of our ancestors out of Africa and the peopling of Eurasia (reviewed in Nielsen et al., 2017Nielsen R. Akey J.M. Jakobsson M. Pritchard J.K. Tishkoff S. Willerslev E. Tracing the peopling of the world through genomics.Nature. 2017; 541: 302-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar); however, with the increasing availability of ancient DNA samples, paleogeneticists are now revealing more detailed movements around the globe. Genome-wide data from 18 ancient individuals in Southeast Asia, for example, suggest that the introduction of farming to the region occurred via migration of a population from southern China, whose ancestry was admixed with hunter-gatherers prior to their movement (Lipson et al., 2018Lipson M. Cheronet O. Mallick S. Rohland N. Oxenham M. Pietrusewsky M. Pryce T.O. Willis A. Matsumura H. Buckley H. et al.Ancient genomes document multiple waves of migration in Southeast Asian prehistory.Science. 2018; 361: 92-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). An independent study of 26 ancient whole genomes further supports the expansion of migrants from East Asia to Southeast Asia ∼4,000 years ago during the cultural transition to farming (McColl et al., 2018McColl H. Racimo F. Vinner L. Demeter F. Gakuhari T. Moreno-Mayar J.V. van Driem G. Gram Wilken U. Seguin-Orlando A. de la Fuente Castro C. et al.The prehistoric peopling of Southeast Asia.Science. 2018; 361: 88-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Both papers highlight the impact of the spread of agriculture on the genetic architecture of Southeast Asian populations while noting that complete turnover of the local populations did not occur and that the extent of its impact varies substantially by region. The origins of ancient populations in North America and their subsequent migratory dynamics have been similarly unclear, and two papers published this year address this problem. Although it is generally accepted that the initial peopling of the Americas occurred via the Beringian land bridge, the genetic identity of these earliest founders was uncertain. Eske Willerslev’s group showed that an Alaskan infant dated to ∼11,400 years ago was from a population that separated from the ancestors of present-day Native Americans before they separated from each other and is no longer represented in populations living today; they also leveraged the sample to make more precise estimates of the splits leading to Native American populations (Moreno-Mayar et al., 2018Moreno-Mayar J.V. Potter B.A. Vinner L. Steinrücken M. Rasmussen S. Terhorst J. Kamm J.A. Albrechtsen A. Malaspinas A.S. Sikora M. et al.Terminal Pleistocene Alaskan genome reveals first founding population of Native Americans.Nature. 2018; 553: 203-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Insight into later events contributing to the peopling of the Americas based on a catalog of 91 ancient genomes from present-day California and Ontario suggests that two distinct ancestries were present in ancient North America, followed by one or more admixture events occurring either pre- or post-migration of these groups southward (Scheib et al., 2018Scheib C.L. Li H. Desai T. Link V. Kendall C. Dewar G. Griffith P.W. Mörseburg A. Johnson J.R. Potter A. et al.Ancient human parallel lineages within North America contributed to a coastal expansion.Science. 2018; 360: 1024-1027Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). These insights into the origins of Native American populations will only grow with further ancient sample availability across the Americas, where paleogenomics is still in its infancy. The study of ancient genomes is not only useful for tracking the origins and movements of populations, but also yields insight into the spread of cultural practices throughout distant regions. A fascinating example of this application was recently published in Nature, in which David Reich’s group characterized the spread of the “Bell Beaker complex” characterized by a specific collection of grave pottery artifacts, which expanded throughout much of Europe and northwest Africa to Britain and Ireland (Olalde et al., 2018Olalde I. Brace S. Allentoft M.E. Armit I. Kristiansen K. Booth T. Rohland N. Mallick S. Szécsényi-Nagy A. Mittnik A. et al.The Beaker phenomenon and the genomic transformation of northwest Europe.Nature. 2018; 555: 190-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). Using genome sequences from 400 ancient Europeans, they were able to demonstrate that the mode of dissemination of this cultural phenomenon depended on geographic region, with human migration playing a strong role in some parts of Europe, including Britain, while cultural transmission independent of migration facilitated its spread from Iberia across Continental Europe. Similarly, the origin of a quite familiar cultural practice, horse domestication, was illuminated with the help of 74 ancient human genomes (de Barros Damgaard et al., 2018de Barros Damgaard P. Martiniano R. Kamm J. Moreno-Mayar J.V. Kroonen G. Peyrot M. Barjamovic G. Rasmassen S. Zacho C. Baimukhanov N. et al.The first horse herders and the impact of early Bronze Age steppe expansions into Asia.Science. 2018; 360 (eaar7711)Crossref Scopus (197) Google Scholar) and 14 ancient horse genomes (Librado et al., 2017Librado P. Gamba C. Gaunitz C. Der Sarkissian C. Pruvost M. Albrechtsen A. Fages A. Khan N. Schubert M. Jagannathan V. et al.Ancient genomic changes associated with domestication of the horse.Science. 2017; 356: 442-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) spanning Inner Asia and Anatolia. Together, analysis of the human and horse genomic data showed that horse domestication occurred twice in Central Asia, spreading first spread through ideas and only later through movement of people and animals. Finally, by stepping even further back, the movements and interactions of now-extinct archaic hominin groups who have left imprints on modern human genomes can be determined. A recent paper from Svante Pääbo’s lab shines light on the potentially widespread interactions between these groups (Slon et al., 2018Slon V. Mafessoni F. Vernot B. de Filippo C. Grote S. Viola B. Hajdinjak M. Peyrégne S. Nagel S. Brown S. et al.The genome of the offspring of a Neanderthal mother and a Denisovan father.Nature. 2018; 561: 113-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Their discovery of an individual with a Neanderthal mother and a Denisovan father, the latter of whom also carried some Neanderthal ancestry himself, is a testament to the frequency with which distinct hominin groups likely interacted and interbred. Indeed, earlier this year, Sharon Browning and colleagues determined that at least two waves of Denisovan admixture with modern humans occurred (Browning et al., 2018Browning S.R. Browning B.L. Zhou Y. Tucci S. Akey J.M. Analysis of Human Sequence Data Reveals Two Pulses of Archaic Denisovan Admixture.Cell. 2018; 173: 53-61.e9Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Although spatial constraints were certainly a factor in these exchanges, it seems increasingly likely that interactions, including those leading to offspring, between ancient and modern hominin groups were not uncommon. In the modern world riddled with categorization and separation, it is heartening to imagine our ancestors as less discriminatory peoples. The questions that remain to be answered by paleogenomics are numerous, and the impressive advances being made in this field are a testament to the power of both technical advances and progress in cooperation between disciplines. Indeed, in our current era of genome sequencing innovation, it is tempting to speculate that progress is limited only by the pace with which archaeologists discover and disinter ancient samples, particularly from underrepresented regions. The capacity to procure material with high-quality DNA is unfortunately biased geographically due to the poor preservation conditions of certain climates. However, with advances in sequencing technology for degraded samples, as well as improved cooperation and connection with local communities and social scientists, the possibilities are enormous. Indeed, the study of ancient genomes, while clearly making huge contributions to our historical knowledge, is also key to the basic understanding of our modern genomes, and insights from our ancestors will help in the endeavor to illuminate phenotypic and disease genetics. As paleogenomics expands, it is crucial to consider the key role of collaboration with, and respect for, members of the other communities invested in such research. The acquisition of samples requires coordination and mutual understanding on the part of geneticists and archaeologists, and both must be sensitive to governmental and local officials under whose purview these artifacts reside. Particularly in the study of regional populations or indigenous communities, it is imperative not only to seek permission but also to share outcomes with the populations under inquiry. In all, ancient DNA as a field must balance its findings with accepted historical and sociological contexts as well as local beliefs in order to illuminate the human past and engage the imagination of the public in a respectful and productive way. Illuminating history through the study of DNA is a triumph not only for individual researchers, but also for science as a whole, given its power to engage the fascination of the general public with their own origins. Through paleogenomics, the value of scientific discovery is magnified through the lens of our own self-reflection."
