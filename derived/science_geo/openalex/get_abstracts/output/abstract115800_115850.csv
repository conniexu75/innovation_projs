However, there is little knowledge of the number or identity of the responsible genes, how they differ between individuals, or how their gene products interact with the developing brain and with environmental and experiential factors to generate the complex blend of attitudes and actions that comprise human temperament1. In the accompanying paper, Ebstein et al.2 have found a population association between a long allele of polymorphic exon III repeat sequence of the D4 dopamine receptor gene (DADR) and the normal personality trait of Novelty Seeking. The possibility of a causal relationship between DADR and Novelty Seeking is further supported by studies showing that the number of exon III repeats can affect the binding of ligands to the receptor3,4; that DADR is expressed in lim-bic areas involved in cognition and emotion5,6; that dopamine mediates exploratory behaviour in experimental animals7–12; that the rewarding effects of amphetamines and cocaine are related to dopamine release13; and that Novelty Seeking is low in dopamine-deficient patients with Parkinson's disease14. We investigated the relationship between DADR exon III sequence variants and personality test scores in a population of 315 mostly male siblings, other family members and individuals from the United States. The association between long alleles of exon III and personality traits related to Novelty Seeking was confirmed. Moreover, family studies showed that this association is the result of genetic transmission rather than of population stratification."

https://openalex.org/W2001146686,"Immune responses dominated by interleukin-4 (IL-4)-producing T helper type 2 (TH2) cells or by interferon γ (IFN-γ)-producing T helper type 1 (TH1) cells express distinctive protection against infection with different pathogens. Interleukin-4 promotes the differentiation of naïve CD4+ T cells into IL-4 producers and suppresses their development into IFN-γ producers. CD1-specific splenic CD4+NK1.1+ T cells, a numerically minor population, produced IL-4 promptly on in vivo stimulation. This T cell population was essential for the induction of IL-4-producing cells and for switching to immunoglobulin E, an IL-4-dependent event, in response to injection of antibodies to immunoglobulin D."

https://openalex.org/W1628998952,"The structural competence of the skeleton is maintained by an adaptive mechanism in which resident bone cells respond to load-induced strains. To investigate the possible role of the messenger molecule nitric oxide (NO) in this response, we studied NO production in well-characterized organ culture systems, rat long bone-derived osteoblast-like (LOBs) cells, and embryonic chick osteocytes (LOCYs) in monolayer culture. In superfused cancellous bone cores, loading (for 15 min) produces increases in NO2- (stable NO metabolite) release during the loading period, which paralleled those in PGI2 and PGE2. Loading of rat vertebrae and ulnae produces increases in NO2- release, and in ulnae NO synthase inhibitors diminish these responses. Transient rapid increases in NO release are stimulated by strain in both LOBs and LOCYs. Polymerase chain reaction amplification of extracted mRNA shows that rat ulnae, LOBs, and LOCYs express both the inducible and neuronal (constitutive) isoforms of NO synthase. Adaptability to mechanical strain relies on assessment of the strain environment followed by modification of bone architecture. Immediate increases in NO production induced by loading suggest the involvement of NO in strain measurement and cellular communication to establish strain distribution, as well as potentially in adaptive changes in bone cell behavior."

https://openalex.org/W2034742750,"The widely used antitumor drug cis-diamminedichloroplatinum(II) (cisplatin or cis-DDP) reacts with DNA, cross-linking two purine residues through the N7 atoms, which reside in the major groove in B-form DNA. The solution structure of the short duplex [d(CAT-AGCTATG)]2 cross-linked at the GC:GC site was determined by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). The deoxyguanosine-bridging cis-diammineplatinum(II) lies in the minor groove, and the complementary deoxycytidines are extrahelical. The double helix is locally reversed to a left-handed form, and the helix is unwound and bent toward the minor groove. These findings were independently confirmed by results from a phase-sensitive gel electrophoresis bending assay. The NMR structure differs markedly from previously proposed models but accounts for the chemical reactivity, the unwinding, and the bending of cis-DDP interstrand cross-linked DNA and may be important in the formation and repair of these cross-links in chromatin."

https://openalex.org/W2017033748,"The crystal structure of a nucleic acid triplex reveals a helix, designated P-form, that differs from previously reported nucleic acid structures. The triplex consists of one polypurine DNA strand complexed to a polypyrimidine hairpin peptide nucleic acid (PNA) and was successfully designed to promote Watson-Crick and Hoogsteen base pairing. The P-form helix is underwound, with a base tilt similar to B-form DNA. The bases are displaced from the helix axis even more than in A-form DNA. Hydrogen bonds between the DNA backbone and the Hoogsteen PNA backbone explain the observation that polypyrimidine PNA sequences form highly stable 2:1 PNA-DNA complexes. This structure expands the number of known stable helical forms that nucleic acids can adopt."
https://openalex.org/W2095351891,"Ubiquitin is a highly conserved polypeptide found in all eukaryotes. The major function of ubiquitin is to target proteins for complete or partial degradation by a multisubunit protein complex called the proteasome. Here, the Drosophila fat facets gene, which is required for the appropriate determination of particular cells in the fly eye, was shown to encode a ubiquitin-specific protease (Ubp), an enzyme that cleaves ubiquitin from ubiquitin-protein conjugates. The Fat facets protein (FAF) acts as a regulatory Ubp that prevents degradation of its substrate by the proteasome. Flies bearing fat facets gene mutations were used to show that a Ubp is cell type--and substrate-specific and a regulator of cell fate decisions in a multicellular organism."

https://openalex.org/W2097748223,"Hypertension, diabetes and hyperlipidemia are risk factors for life-threatening complications such as end-stage renal disease, coronary artery disease and stroke. Why some patients develop complications is unclear, but only susceptibility genes may be involved. To test this notion, we studied crosses involving the fawn-hooded rat, an animal model of hypertension that develops chronic renal failure. Here, we report the localization of two genes, Rf-1 and Rf-2, responsible for about half of the genetic variation in key indices of renal impairment. In addition, we localize a gene, Bpfh-1, responsible for about 26% of the genetic variation in blood pressure. Rf-1 strongly affects the risk of renal impairment, but has no significant effect on blood pressure. Our results show that susceptibility to a complication of hypertension is under at least partially independent genetic control from susceptibility to hypertension itself."

https://openalex.org/W1907937104,"FcR γ chain has previously been shown to interact with the TCR-CD3 complex, the IgE Fc receptor I (Fc∊RI), and the class I and IIIA IgG receptors (FcγRI and FcγRIIIa). Here, we demonstrate that the Fc receptor γchain associates with FcαR in transfected IIA1.6 B lymphocytes. FcαR could be expressed at the surface of IIA1.6 B cells by itself, but was devoid of signaling capacity. Upon co-expression of FcR γchain, a physical interaction with FcαR could be demonstrated. This association proved crucial for the triggering of both proximal (intracellular calcium increase and tyrosine phosphorylation), as well as distal (IL-2 release), signal transduction responses. We next tested the hypothesis that a positively charged arginine residue (Arg209) within the transmembrane domain of FcαR promotes association with FcR γchain. We therefore constructed FcαR molecules where Arg209 was mutated to either a positively charged histidine, a negatively charged aspartic acid, or an uncharged leucine. A functional association between FcαR and FcR γchain was observed only with a positively charged residue (Arg209 or His209) present within the FcαR transmembrane domain. These data show that transmembrane signal transduction by the FcαR is mediated via FcR γchain, and that FcαR requires a positively charged residue within the transmembrane domain to promote functional association.

IgA is the primary immunoglobulin in bodily secretions and plays a critical role in protection against the constant environmental challenges at mucosal sites. Although the protective mechanisms are incompletely defined, a significant role in IgA-mediated immune defense has been proposed for IgA Fc receptors. These molecules have been detected on most populations of phagocytic cells in blood and mucosal tissues. Engagement of these molecules can trigger phagocytosis, degranulation, oxidative burst, inflammatory mediator release, and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity(1.Kerr M.A. Biochem. J. 1990; 271: 285-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar, 2.Shen L. Immunol. Res. 1992; 11: 273-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). FcαR on monocytes/macrophages and neutrophils has been defined as a 55-75-kDa glycoprotein(3.Monteiro R.C. Kubagawa H. Cooper M.D. J. Exp.

The cDNA encoding the myeloid FcαR has been characterized and was found to encode a 30-kDa peptide, with two extracellular Ig-like domains, a hydrophobic transmembrane region and a cytoplasmic tail devoid of recognized signaling motifs(2.Shen L.

The gene structure indicates FcαR to represent a more distantly related member of the immunoglobulin receptor gene family (7.De Wit T.P.M. Morton H.C. Capel P.J.A. Van de Winkel J.G.J. J.

To explore the capacity of FcαR to trigger biological functions, we have now generated different transfectants in the mouse IIA1.6 B cell line. This line, derived from the A20 B cell lymphoma, lacks the 5′-end of the FcγRII gene and, consequently, is Fc receptor-negative(8.Jones B. Tite J.P. Janeway Jr., C.A. J. Immunol. 1986; 136: 348-356PubMed Google Scholar). Previous work showed this line to represent an excellent model for assaying FcγR-mediated functioning(9.Amigorena S. Bonnerot C. Drake J.R.

Nature. 1994; 368: 70-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). Following transfection, FcαR was expressed at the surface of IIA1.6 cells by itself, but lacked signaling capacity. We therefore hypothesized that FcαR may associate with a specialized signaling molecule. The FcR γchain was known previously to associate with all three classes of FcγR, Fc∊RI, and the TCR-CD3 complex(12.Ravetch J. Kinet J.-P. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1991; 9: 457-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (1263) Google Scholar, 13.Ernst L.K. Duchemin A.-M. Anderson C.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Roos D. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 7188-7195PubMed Google Scholar). FcR γchain is responsible for coupling these receptors to intracellular signaling pathways(16.Kinet J.-P. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1992; 4: 43-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). By co-transfection experiments, we tested whether FcR γchain could mediate signal transduction via FcαR. Our results show that co-expression of FcαR and FcR γchain in IIA1.6 B cells conferred both proximal and distal signaling capacity to FcαR. During the preparation of this manuscript, it was shown that, in the U937 cell line, FcαR was associated with FcR γ chain and that γ chain was phosphorylated on tyrosine residues following FcαR cross-linking (17.Pfefferkorn L.C. Yeaman G.R. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 3228-3236PubMed Google Scholar). The data presented here indeed confirm that FcαR associates with FcR γchain in transfected IIA1.6 B cells and, furthermore, suggest that FcαR and FcR γchain can associate in normal blood PMN. The present experiments demonstrate FcR γchain to be critical for FcαR-mediated transmembrane signal transduction. We, furthermore, explored the molecular basis for FcαR/FcR γchain association. The transmembrane (TM) domain of FcαR is unusual as it contains a single positively charged arginine (Arg209) residue. Since the TM domain of the FcR γchain contains a single negatively charged aspartic acid residue, we hypothesized that these oppositely charged residues may promote association. A similar mechanism involving charged TM amino acids has previously been shown to be involved in the assembly of the TCR-CD3 complex(18.Morley B.J. Chin K.N. Newton M.E. Weiss A. J. Exp. Med. 1988; 168: 1971-1978Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 19.John S. Banting G.S. Goodfellow P.N. Owen M.J. Eur. J.

Cell Biol. 1990; 6: 403-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). Using PCR, we mutated the Arg209 found in the wild type FcαR (R209) to either a positively charged histidine (R209H), a negatively charged aspartic acid (R209D), or an uncharged leucine (R209L). Mutated FcαR cDNAs were transfected together with FcR γchain to IIA1.6 cells and assessed for their ability to trigger an increase in [Ca2+]i following FcαR cross-linking. Our data show a positively charged residue within the TM domain of FcαR to be required for functional association with FcR γchain. The murine B cell line IIA1.6 (8.Jones B. Tite J.P. Janeway Jr., C.A. J. Immunol. 1986; 136: 348-356PubMed Google Scholar) and the human cell line U937 were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 2 mM glutamine, and 1 mM sodium pyruvate. FcαR+ and FcαR+/γ+ transfectants were maintained in the same medium supplemented with either Geneticin (G418, 0.8 mg/ml; Life Technologies, Inc.) alone or Geneticin and methotrexate (10 μM; Pharmachemie, Haarlem, The Netherlands), respectively. PMN were purified as described previously(22.Verhoeven A.J. van Schaik M.L.J. Roos D. Weening R.S. Blood. 1988; 71: 505-507Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Murine macrophages were isolated from the peritoneal cavity by rinsing with RPMI 1640, 10% fetal calf serum. The human FcαR cDNA contained within the pCAV vector was a kind gift from Dr. C. Maliszewski(6.Maliszewski C.R. March C.J. Schoenborn M.A. Gimpel S. Shen L. J. Exp. Med. 1990; 172: 1665-1672Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). The murine FcR γ chain cDNA (23.Ra C. Jouvin M.-H. E. Kinet J.-P. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 15323-15327Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was cloned into the pNUT expression vector (pNUT-γ), allowing selection of transfectants with methotrexate(24.Palmiter R.D. Behringer R.R. Quaife C.J. Maxwell F. Maxwell I.H. Brinster R.L. Cell. 1987; 50: 435-443Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). Transfection of IIA1.6 B cells was performed by electroporation as described previously(10.Van den Herik-Oudijk I.E. Westerdaal N.A.C. Henriquez N.V. Capel P.J.A. van de Winkel J.G.J. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 574-585PubMed Google Scholar). IIA1.6 B cells were stably transfected with FcαR alone (FcαR+) or with FcαR and γ chain (FcαR+/γ+) as follows. FcαR+ cells were generated by co-transfection of FcαR cDNA in pCAV, using pRC-CMV.neo as selection marker(10.Van den Herik-Oudijk I.E. Westerdaal N.A.C. Henriquez N.V. Capel P.J.A. van de Winkel J.G.J. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 574-585PubMed Google Scholar). Two days following transfection, cells were transferred to medium containing G418 and seeded in 24-well plates. After 14 days, each well was tested for FcαR expression by FACS analysis using anti-FcαR mAb A77 (murine IgG1; (4.Monteiro R.C. Cooper M.D. Kubagawa H. J. Immunol. 1992; 148: 1764-1770PubMed Google Scholar)) or My43 (murine IgM; (25.Shen L. Lasser R. Fanger M.W. J. Immunol. 1989; 143: 4117-4122PubMed Google Scholar)). FcαR+ cells were isolated (two rounds of selection) using mAb A77 and Dynabeads coated with rat anti-mouse IgG1 (Dynal, Oslo, Norway)(10.Van den Herik-Oudijk I.E. Westerdaal N.A.C. Henriquez N.V. Capel P.J.A. van de Winkel J.G.J. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 574-585PubMed Google Scholar). FcαR+/γ+ cells were generated by co-transfection of pCAV, pNUT-γ, and pRC-CMV.neo. Two days following transfection, cells were transferred to medium containing G418 and 1 μM methotrexate. After 2 weeks, the concentration of methotrexate was increased to 10 μM. All cells surviving this selection procedure were found to be FcαR-positive. Expression of FcR γchain was analyzed by RT-PCR, immunoprecipitation, and Western blotting. Overlap extension PCR (26.Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 77: 51-59Crossref Scopus (6735) Google Scholar) was used to construct mutant FcαR cDNAs where the codon CGC (encoding Arg209 in the wild type FcαR) was mutated to either CAC (histidine), GAC (aspartic acid), or CTA (leucine). For each mutant, a first round of PCR was performed, as follows, generating two DNA fragments with overlapping ends. 5′ fragments were generated using a sense oligonucleotide primer FCAL (5′-ATGGACCCCAAACAGACC-3′) and either antisense primer H2 (5′-TGCCACGGCCATGTGGATCAAGTT-3′), D2 (5′-TGCCACGGCCATGTCGATCAAGTT-3′), or L2 (5′-TGCCACGGCCATTAGGATCAAGAT-3′). Similarly, 3′ DNA fragments were generated using the antisense primer AS1 (5′-TCCAGGTGTTTACTTGCAGACAC-3′) and either the sense primer H1 (ACCTTGATCCACATGGCCGTGGCA-3′), D1 (5′-ACCTTGATCGACATGGCCGTGGCA-3′), or L1 (5′-ACCTTGATCCTAATGGCCGTGGCA-3′). Mismatch nucleotides responsible for the introduction of the desired mutation are underlined. First round PCR amplification was carried out by using 50 ng of FcαR cDNA as template, in a reaction mixture containing 50 mM KCl, 20 mM Tris•Cl, pH 8.3, 2.5 mM each dNTP, 2.5 mM MgCl2, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 10 pmol of each primer, and 2 units of Vent DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs) in a final volume of 100 μl. Samples were overlaid with light mineral oil, denatured at 94°C for 5 min, before 30 cycles of amplification in a DNA thermal cycler 480 (Perkin Elmer) using a step program (94°C, 1 min; 55°C, 1 min; 72°C, 2 min) followed by a final extension at 72°C for 7 min. A second round of PCR was subsequently used to generate mutated cDNAs encoding the entire FcαR coding region. PCR conditions were as above, except that 25 ng of each overlapping DNA fragment was added as template along with 10 pmol of primers FCAL and AS1, and 1 unit of AmpliTaq DNA polymerase (Perkin Elmer) was used to amplify mutated cDNA fragments. PCR products were subcloned into pGEM-T (Promega) vectors, and the integrity of all mutants was confirmed by sequence analysis. Mutant cDNAs were cloned into the eukaryotic expression vector pSG5 (27.Green S. Issemann I. Sheer E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 367-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (543) Google Scholar) prior to transfection as described above. Cells were incubated with either mAb A77 or My43 culture supernatant for 30 min at 4°C. Cells were washed twice with PBS, 1% bovine serum albumin, 0.1% NaN3, and subsequently incubated with either FITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse (GAM) IgG1 or FITC-conjugated GAM IgM, respectively (Southern Biotechnology). Following 30 min incubation at 4°C, cells were washed twice and analyzed on a FACScan flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson). For intracellular staining, cells were permeabilized by incubation in FACS Lysing Solution (Becton Dickinson) for 10 min at room temperature. After washing, FcR γchain expression was detected by incubation with a rabbit antiserum against FcR γchain (generously provided by Dr J.-P. Kinet; (28.Letourneur O. Kennedy I.C.S. Brini A.T. Ortaldo J.R. O'Shea J.J. Kinet J.-P. J. Immunol. 1991; 147: 2652-2656PubMed Google Scholar)) followed by FITC-conjugated goat anti-rabbit F(ab′)2 fragments (Southern Biotechnology). Intracellular free calcium levels were analyzed using a FACScan(10.Van den Herik-Oudijk I.E. Westerdaal N.A.C. Henriquez N.V. Capel P.J.A. van de Winkel J.G.J. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 574-585PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were loaded simultaneously with SNARF-1 (2.8 μM) and Fluo-3 (1.4 μM) (Molecular Probes) by incubation for 30 min at 37°C. After washing, cells were resuspended in calcium mobilization buffer at a concentration of 1 × 107 cells/ml. A flow rate of ~140 cells/s was used for calcium mobilization studies with the initial 24 s of each run used to establish a baseline value for the intracellular free calcium concentration, [Ca2+]i. The ability of FcαR (with or without FcR γ chain) to trigger [Ca2+]i increases was determined by incubating SNARF-1/Fluo-3-loaded cells with either mAb A77 or My43 for 20 min at room temperature (in the dark). After washing, cells were run on a flow cytometer for 24 s, and GAM IgG1 or GAM IgM Ab was added to cross-link FcαR. Total cellular RNA was extracted from 1 × 107 cells using the RNAzol B isolation method followed by cDNA synthesis (10.Van den Herik-Oudijk I.E. Westerdaal N.A.C. Henriquez N.V. Capel P.J.A. van de Winkel J.G.J. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 574-585PubMed Google Scholar). FcR γchain transcripts were detected via PCR using two γchain-specific primers, MG1 (sense; 5′-ATCTCAGCCGTGATCTTG-3′) and MG2 (antisense; 5′-TCAGGTCTCTGGCAGCTT-3′) (Isogen Bioscience, Amsterdam) encompassing nucleotides 46-578 of murine γchain. FcαR transcripts were amplified using primers FCAL and AS1 (see above). As a control, we used a sense and antisense primer set for the hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase housekeeping gene ((29.Savelkoul H.F.J. van Ommen R. Vossen A.C.T.M. Breedland E.G. Coffman R.L. van Oudenaren A. J. Immunol. Methods. 1994; 170: 185-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar); a gift from Dr. H. Savelkoul, Erasmus University, Rotterdam). Cells (1 × 107 per precipitation) were washed three times in PBS before surface radioiodination by the lactoperoxidase method. Cells were lysed in 1% digitonin, 150 mM NaCl, 10 mM triethanolamine, pH 7.4, containing the protease inhibitors phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, Nα-p-tosyl-L-lysine chloromethyl ketone, soybean trypsin inhibitor, and leupeptin (15.Masuda M. Roos D. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 7188-7195PubMed Google Scholar) for 45 min at 4°C. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 30 min. Lysates were then precleared four times with Protein G-coated Sepharose CL-4B beads (Pharmacia) and once with beads coated with either an irrelevant mouse IgG1 mAb directed against plant allergens (CLB, Amsterdam) (A77 control) or rabbit serum (FcR γchain antiserum control). Specific precipitations were then performed with beads coated with either mAb A77 or a rabbit antiserum against FcR γchain. The beads were washed four times with digitonin lysis buffer, and precipitates were analyzed by reducing SDS-PAGE on 10% polyacrylamide gels followed by autoradiography. Proteins were immunoprecipitated as described above, separated by nonreducing SDS-PAGE on 15% polyacrylamide gels, and electrotransferred to nitrocellulose membranes (14.Scholl P.R. Geha R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8847-8850Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The blots were incubated in blocking buffer (PBS containing 5% nonfat dry milk) for 1 h at room temperature and then with rabbit anti-γ chain serum (1:2000) for 2 h (room temperature). After several washes, blots were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated horse anti-rabbit Ig (1:2000; CLB, Amsterdam) in TBST (10 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20, pH 8.0) containing 1.5% nonfat dry milk. After extensive washing, bound antibody was detected by chemiluminescence (Boehringer Mannheim, Mannheim, Germany). Transfectants were incubated with mAb A77 for 30 min at room temperature, washed twice with RPMI 1640 medium, and resuspended in separate tubes (2 × 105 cells/30 μl). GAM IgG1 (final concentration 20 μg/ml) was added for the indicated time periods at 37°C to cross-link FcαR. Reactions were stopped by the addition of 70 μl of reducing SDS-PAGE sample buffer (50 mM Tris/HCl (pH 6.8), 10% glycerol, 4.3% SDS, 0.05% bromphenol blue, 4%β-mercaptoethanol). Tyrosine phosphorylation signals resulting from cross-linking sIgG2a by addition of GAM F(ab′)2 fragments for 2 min at 37°C served as a positive control. Background levels of tyrosine phosphorylation were determined by omitting the cross-linking GAM IgG1. After boiling for 3 min, 15-μl aliquots were separated on 7.5% SDS-PAGE gels and electrotransferred to nitrocellulose membranes (0.45 μm; Schleicher & Schuell, Dassel, Germany) using a Transblot cell system (Bio-Rad). Membranes were blocked in PT buffer (PBS, 0.1% Tween 20) containing 5% nonfat dry milk (Nutricia, Zoetermeer, The Netherlands) and probed with anti-phosphotyrosine mAb (4G10; UBI, Lake Placid, NY) in PT, 0.05% nonfat dry milk for 1.5 h at room temperature. Following washing three times in PT and once in PT, 0.5% nonfat dry milk for 20 min, membranes were incubated with peroxidase-conjugated GAM IgG (Dako, Glostrup, Denmark) for 1.5 h at room temperature. After washing twice with PT and once with PT, 0.5% NaCl, bound antibodies were detected using the ECL detection system (Amersham, Buckinghamshire, UK). Transfectants were incubated with mAb A77 for 30 min at room temperature. Following washing, cells were seeded into 96-well plates and GAM IgG1 (30 μg/ml) added to the culture supernatant for 24 h at 37°C. Alternatively, transfectants were added to wells pre-coated with either human serum IgA (Organon Teknika, Belgium) or human polymeric IgA, isolated from the serum of myeloma patients (a gift from Dr. M. Daha), and incubated for 24 h at 37°C. As control, IL-2 production was triggered via surface IgG2a cross-linking by addition of GAM Ab to culture supernatants for 24 h at 37°C. IL-2 production was assessed by culturing 1 × 104 CTLL-2 IL-2-dependent cells with the transfectant culture supernatants in 96-well plates. After a 24-h incubation at 37°C, 1 μCi of [3H]thymidine was added to each well and cultured for 4 h, and cells were harvested onto glass fiber filters (Wallac, Turku, Finland) for liquid scintillation counting. We transfected IIA1.6 B lymphoma cells with cDNAs encoding either FcαR alone, or FcαR and FcR γ chain. The FcαR was surface-expressed at a high level in both FcαR+ and FcαR+/γ+ transfectants (Fig. 1A). In FcαR+/γ+ transfectants, the presence of a γ chain message was detected by specific RT-PCR (Fig. 1B). Expression of γ chain at the protein level was confirmed by FACS analysis of permeabilized cells using an anti-γ chain serum (Fig. 1C). FcαR expressed on IIA1.6 cells were reactive with previously described CD89 mAb A77 (Fig. 1A), My43, and A59 and were capable of binding human IgA (data not shown). The increased level of FcαR expression seen in FcαR+/γ+ cells was presumably not due to co-expression of the FcR γ chain since no increase in FcαR expression was observed following transfection of FcR γ chain cDNA to FcαR+ IIA1.6 cells. Furthermore, these latter cells were capable of all signaling processes attributable to FcαR+/γ+ cells (data not shown). We found untransfected IIA1.6 cells not to express endogenous FcR γchain (Fig. 1B). This observation suggests that, in contrast to FcγRIIIa and Fc∊RI(12.Ravetch J. Kinet J.-P. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1991; 9: 457-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (1263) Google Scholar, 16.Kinet J.-P. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1992; 4: 43-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), mere cell surface expression of FcαR in IIA1.6 cells is not dependent on the presence of FcR γchain. Previously, it was also shown that FcαR could be expressed on the surface of COS cells in the absence of FcR γchain(6.Maliszewski C.R. March C.J. Schoenborn M.A. Gimpel S. Shen L. J. Exp. Med. 1990; 172: 1665-1672Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Similarly, the high affinity IgG receptor FcγRI (CD64), which also associates with FcR γchain(13.Ernst L.K. Duchemin A.-M. Anderson C.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6023-6027Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 14.Scholl P.R. Geha R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8847-8850Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), can be expressed by itself in COS (13.Ernst L.K. Duchemin A.-M. Anderson C.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6023-6027Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar) and 3T3 transfectants(30.Duits A.J. Aarden L.A. Ernst L.K. Capel P.J.A. van de Winkel J.G.J. Clin. Exp. Immunol. 1993; 92: 225-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). We next performed experiments to determine whether there is physical association between FcαR and FcR γ chain. Cells were surface-labeled with 125I and lysed in 1% digitonin prior to immunoprecipitation with anti-FcαR mAb A77 or anti-FcR γ chain antiserum (Fig. 2A). Immunoprecipitation with CD89 mAb A77 resulted in the isolation of one major band of ~60 kDa (arrowheads) from both FcαR+ (lane 2) and FcαR+/γ+ (lane 3) transfectants, but not from untransfected IIA1.6 cells (lane 1). The molecular weight of the observed band is consistent with the predicted size of FcαR(3.Monteiro R.C. Kubagawa H. Cooper M.D. J. Exp. Med. 1990; 171: 597-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 4.Monteiro R.C. Cooper M.D. Kubagawa H. J. Immunol. 1992; 148: 1764-1770PubMed Google Scholar, 5.Monteiro R.C. Hostoffer R.W. Cooper M.D. Bonner J.R. Gartland G.L. Kubagawa H. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 1681-1685Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation of radiolabeled cell lysates with an anti-γ chain-specific antibody precipitated one band of 60 kDa only from the FcαR/transfectants (Fig. 2A). Western blotting analysis of immunoprecipitated proteins further supported the presence of a physical interaction between FcαR and FcR chain in transfectants and suggest that FcαR and FcR chain can also associate in peripheral blood PMN. Proteins were precipitated from digitonin-solubilized cells with beads coated with either A77, anti-FcR chain serum, or control serum (see “Materials and Methods”), transferred to nitrocellulose, and probed with anti-FcR chain serum. In IIA1.6 cells, a specific band of 20 kDa, corresponding to the expected size of FcR chain homodimers(12.Ravetch J. Kinet J.-P. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1991; 9: 457-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (1263) Google Scholar), was co-precipitated by anti-FcαR mAb A77 from FcαR/cells only (Fig. 2B, lane 3). No bands of this size were precipitated by A77 from either untransfected IIA1.6 or FcαR transfectant cell lysates (lanes 1 and 2). Similarly sized bands were detected in PMN cell lysates following immunoprecipitation with either A77 (lane 4) or anti- chain serum (lane 5). No specific bands of this size were seen following immunoprecipitation with either an irrelevant mouse IgG1 antibody (Fig. 2C, lanes 1-4; A77 control) or with normal rabbit serum (Fig. 2C, lane 5; anti- chain control). The 28-kDa bands seen in Fig. 2B, lanes 1-5, are considered to be nonspecific since these bands were also seen in the control immunoprecipitations (Fig. 2C, lanes 1-5). We, furthermore, observed a slight difference in mobility of the FcR chain between transfectants (murine chain) and PMN (human chain) (Fig. 2B, lane 3 versus lanes 4 and 5). This different migration profile was surprising in view of the high homology between murine and human chains(12.Ravetch J. Kinet J.-P. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1991; 9: 457-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (1263) Google Scholar). Therefore, we next precipitated murine chain from FcαR/transfectants and murine peritoneal macrophages, and human chain from PMN and U937 cells. Following SDS-PAGE and transfer to nitrocellulose, the blots were probed with anti- chain serum. Results presented in Fig. 2D, clearly showed a slight, albeit significant, difference in mobility between murine (lanes 1 and 2) and human (lanes 3 and 4) FcR chains. The observed difference in the mobilities of human and mouse chains may be explained by the slightly different amino acid sequences of these two chains. However, the phosphorylation state of FcR chain has also been shown to affect its mobility in SDS-PAGE(31.Park J.-G. Murray R.K. Chein P. Darby C. Schreiber A.D. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 2073-2079Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar); therefore, differential phosphorylation between human and murine cells may also explain the observed size difference. Previously it has been demonstrated that FcR chain homodimers associate with TCR-CD3, FcRI, and all three classes of FcR (12.Ravetch J. Kinet J.-P. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1991; 9: 457-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (1263) Google Scholar, 13.Ernst L.K. Duchemin A.-M. Anderson C.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Roos D. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 7188-7195PubMed Google Scholar).

In contrast to models of the nuclear pore complex, which assume passive bidirectional diffusion of molecules less than 70 kilodaltons, diffusion of intermediate-sized molecules was regulated by the nuclear envelope calcium stores. After depletion of nuclear store calcium by inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate or calcium chelators, fluorescent molecules conjugated to 10-kilodalton dextran were unable to enter the nucleus. Dye exclusion after calcium store depletion was not dependent on the nuclear matrix because it occurred in nuclear ghosts lacking nucleoplasm. Smaller molecules and ions (500-dalton Lucifer yellow and manganese) diffused freely into the core of the nuclear ghosts and intact nuclei even after calcium store depletion. Thus, depletion of the nuclear calcium store blocks diffusion of intermediate-sized molecules."

Chronic exposure of cells to morphine leads to the rapid development of tolerance. Withdrawal of morphine or [D-Ala2, N-methyl-Phe4,Gly-ol5]enkephalin following chronic treatment (by wash or addition of the antagonist naloxone) leads to an immediate increase in cyclase activity (supersensitization or overshoot), which is gradually reversed upon further incubation with naloxone. Phosphodiesterase inhibitors do not affect the overshoot, indicating that it results from cyclase stimulation rather than phosphodiesterase regulation. Morphine's potency to inhibit cAMP accumulation is the same before and after chronic treatment, suggesting that the apparent tolerance results from cyclase activation, rather than from receptor desensitization. The similar kinetics of induction of tolerance and overshoot support this idea. Both the overshoot and acute opioid-induced cyclase inhibition are blocked by naloxone and are pertussis toxin-sensitive, indicating that both phenomena are mediated by the μ-receptor and Gi/Go proteins. The supersensitization is cycloheximide-insensitive, indicating that it does not require newly synthesized proteins. This is supported by the rapid development of supersensitization.

https://openalex.org/W1988671518,"We have shown that the 105-kDa heat shock protein (HSP105) and the 42°C-specific heat shock protein (42°C-HSP) constitute high molecular mass heat shock proteins. To elucidate the structure of these heat shock proteins, we have screened a cDNA library constructed with poly(A)+ RNA derived from mouse FM3A cells preheated at 42°C for 2 h using an antibody against murine HSP105. Two full-length cDNA clones were obtained: the pB105-1 insert encoded an 858-amino acid protein, and the pB105-2 insert encoded an 814-amino acid protein and lacked 44 amino acids found in pB105-1. The two clones contained the amino acid sequence found in the 17-kDa polypeptide fragments from HSP105 and 42°C-HSP by lysylendopeptidase digestion. In vitro translation products of the RNA transcripts from pB105-1 and pB105-2 migrated to the same positions of HSP105 and 42°C-HSP, respectively, on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Northern blot analysis showed that the transcript was ~4 kilobases in murine FM3A cells and was strongly induced by heat shock and by treatment with arsenite or an amino acid analog. By reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis using primers by which deletion of 132 nucleotides in pB105-2 could be detected, the polymerase chain reaction product corresponding to pB105-2 was increased only after heat shock at 42°C, whereas the product corresponding to pB105-1 was induced by heat shock at either 42 or 45°C and also by other stresses. Thus, the cDNA clones pB105-1 and pB105-2 encode HSP105 and 42°C-HSP, respectively, and HSP105 and 42°C-HSP (a short form of HSP105) are suggested to be produced by alternative splicing.

Relatively little is known, however, about the structure and aggregation state of these four transmembrane-domained proteins. The asymmetrical unit membrane (AUM), believed to play a major role in stabilizing the apical surface of mammalian urothelium thus preventing it from rupturing during bladder distention, contains two TM4 members, the uroplakins (UPs) Ia and Ib. In association with two other (single transmembrane-domained) membrane proteins, UPII and UPIII, UPIa and UPIb form 16-nm particles that naturally form two-dimensional crystalline arrays, thus providing unique opportunities for studying membrane structure and function. To better understand how these proteins interact to form the 16-nm particles, we analyzed their nearest neighbor relationship by chemical cross-linking. We show here that UPIa and UPIb, which share 39% of their amino acid sequence, are cross-linked to UPII and UPIII, respectively. We also show that UPIa has a propensity to oligomerize, forming complexes that are stable in SDS, and that UPII can be readily cross-linked to form homodimers. The formation of UPII homodimers is sensitive, however, to octyl glucoside that can solubilize the AUMs. These data suggest that there exist two types of 16-nm AUM particles that contain UPIa/UPII or UPIb/UPIII, and support a model in which the UPIa and UPII occupy the inner and outer domains, respectively, of the UPIa/UPII particle. This model can account for the apparent “redundancy” of the uroplakins, as the structurally related UPIa and UPIb, by interacting with different partners, may play different roles in AUM formation. The model also suggests that AUM plaques with different uroplakin compositions may differ in their assembly, and in their abilities to interact with an underlying cytoskeleton. Our data indicate that two closely related TM4 proteins, UPIa and UPIb, can be present in the same cell, interacting with distinct partners.

Thus the TM4 proteins that have been identified so far include several tumor-related surface proteins CO-029 (Szala et al., 1990), L6 (Marken et al., 1992), SAS (Jankowski et al., 1994), and R2 (Gaugitsch et al., 1991) (the last was recently described as a metastasis suppressor gene for prostate cancer (Dong et al., 1995)); leukocyte-differentiation markers CD9 (Boucheix et al., 1991; Lanza et al., 1991), CD37 (Classon et al., 1990), CD53 (Amiot, 1990; Korinek and Horejsi, 1993), CD63 (Hotta et al., 1988; Metzelaar et al., 1991), CD81 (also known as TAPA-1; Oren et al., 1990; Engel and Tedder, 1994), and CD82 (Lebel et al., 1994; Nagira et al., 1994); as well as major epithelial differentiation products uroplakins Ia and Ib (Yu et al., 1994). Closely related molecules, SM23 and SJ23, have even been found in parasitic helminth schistosomes (Davern et al., 1991; Reynolds et al., 1992), indicating that members of this gene family are conserved during evolution. Since the intron positions of several of the TM4 genes are conserved, these genes may have diverged from a common ancestral gene (Horejsi and Vlcek, 1991; Wright et al., 1993; Wright and Tomlinson, 1994). Recent data indicate that some of these TM4 proteins may play important roles in cell growth, adhesion, and metastasis (Horejsi and Vlcek, 1991; Miyake et al., 1991; Schick and Levy, 1993; Wright and Tomlinson, 1994; Dong et al., 1995). However, many crucial questions regarding the structure and function of TM4 proteins remain unanswered. For example, how do these integral membrane proteins, most of them lacking a significant cytoplasmic domain, perform their functions on the cell surface? In several cases, more than one TM4 protein exists in the same cell; thus CD81 and CD82 coexist in T cells (Imai and Yoshie, 1993; Nagira et al., 1994), and uroplakins Ia and Ib coexist in the differentiated urothelial cells (Yu et al., 1994). In such cases, do these TM4 proteins always interact with each other? Or do some of these TM4 proteins interact specifically with other integral membrane proteins? transmembrane 4 ethylene glyco-bis(succinimidyl succinate) 1,5-difluoro-2,4-dinitrobenzene polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propaneslfonic acid diphtheria toxin receptor heparin-binding epidermal growth factor. Uroplakins Ia (UPIa; 27-kDa) 2These apparent molecular masses of uroplakins were determined by analyzing nonreduced uroplakins by SDS-PAGE on a 17% polyacrylamide gel (Wu et al., 1990; Yu et al., 1990). These values varied slightly with sample reduction and with the use of different electrophoretic conditions, such as Tricine-SDS-PAGE. These relative sizes, along with the cDNA-derived molecular masses, of uroplakin monomers as well as cross-linked dimers are summarized in Table 1. and Ib (UPIb; 28-kDa; also known as TI-1) (Kallin et al., 1991) are two newly identified TM4 proteins that are synthesized by the terminally differentiated, superficially located cells of mammalian urothelium (Yu et al., 1994). Together with two other proteins, i.e. the 15-kDa uroplakin II (Lin et al., 1994, 1995) and the 47-kDa uroplakin III (Wu and Sun, 1993), the UPIa and UPIb are major protein components of the so-called asymmetrical unit membrane (AUM) (Wu et al., 1990; Yu et al., 1990), which forms numerous plaques covering about 80% of the apical surface area of mammalian urothelium (Porter and Bonneville, 1963; Hicks, 1965; Porter et al., 1967; Koss, 1969; Chlapowski et al., 1972). These AUM plaques are believed to play a role in stabilizing the luminal surface of the epithelium thus preventing it from rupturing during bladder distention (Staehelin et al., 1972; Minsky and Chlapowski, 1978; Sarikas and Chlapowski, 1986). Recent biochemical data indicate that the major hydrophilic loop interconnecting the third and fourth trans-membrane domains of UPIa and UPIb is exposed on the extracellular surface, because this domain becomes protected from protease digestion once the in vitro transcribed and translated UPIa is inserted into dog pancreatic microsomes (Yu et al., 1994). In addition, in both UPIa and UPIb, this domain contains an N-glycosylation site which harbors high mannose type carbohydrates (Wu et al., 1994; Yu et al., 1994). These data strongly suggest that UPIa and UPIb, like several other members of the TM4 superfamily, assume the so-called “type III” transmembrane configuration with the major hydrophilic domain extending into the extracellular space leaving very little cytoplasmic domains (Yu et al., 1994). The asymmetrical unit membrane offers unique opportunities for studying the detailed structural arrangement and possible function of the two differentiation-dependent members of the TM4 family, i.e. the uroplakins Ia and Ib, because AUMs can be purified in milligram quantities (Wu et al., 1990; 1994). Moreover, uroplakins interact closely with one another forming highly organized 16-nm protein particles that naturally form two-dimensional crystalline arrays thus greatly facilitating a detailed analysis of protein structure (Hicks and Ketterer, 1969; Vergara et al., 1969; Chlapowski et al., 1972; Taylor and Robertson, 1984; Walz et al., 1995). We have therefore probed the topographical relationship among the four major integral membrane protein subunits of the asymmetrical unit membrane using the chemical cross-linking approach. Unexpectedly, our results indicate that uroplakins Ia and Ib are cross-linked to the 15-kDa uroplakin II and the 47-kDa UPIII, respectively. The fact that the two structurally related uroplakins Ia and Ib are cross-linked to different partners suggests that the two TM4 proteins play distinct roles in AUM structure. In addition, we present data showing that, in intact AUMs, uroplakin II can be cross-linked to form a homodimer, and that UPIa can form oligomers that are stable in SDS. Taken together, these results suggest a model in which uroplakins Ia and II occupy the inner and outer domains, respectively, of a 16-nm protein particle, and raise the possibility that AUMs are composed of two types of 16-nm particles containing different subsets of uroplakin molecules. To isolate the crude membranes of bovine urothelium, we obtained bovine bladder mucosa by scraping, washed the cells three times in phosphate-buffered saline, and homogenized them in 10 mM Hepes/NaOH (pH 7.5) containing 1 mM each of phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, EDTA, and EGTA. After centrifugation at 2,000 × g at 4°C for 10 min, the pellet was homogenized in the same buffer, transferred onto a 1.6 M sucrose cushion, and centrifuged at 28,000 × g at 4°C for 20 min. The membranes located at the interface were collected, washed with 10 mM Hepes (pH 7.5), and were used as the so-called “crude membrane fraction” for some of the cross-linking experiments. To further purify the asymmetrical unit membranes, we suspended these crude membranes in 2% Sarkosyl in 10 mM Hepes buffer (pH 7.5) at room temperature for 10 min and recovered the (insoluble) asymmetrical unit membranes by centrifugation at 18,000 × g at 4°C for 30 min (Wu et al., 1990, 1994). A portion of the AUMs was further treated with 25 mM NaOH, followed by washing with 10 mM Hepes buffer (pH 7.5). The membrane proteins were dissolved in 1% SDS and quantitated using the BCA reagent (Pierce). Rabbit antisera were raised against oligopeptides that were synthesized according to the cDNA-deduced amino acid sequence of bovine uroplakins Ia (DSNQGRELTRLWDRC); uroplakin Ib (AKDDSSVRSFQGLLIFGNC); uroplakin II (CDSGSGFTVTRLSA and SAYQVTNLAPGTKYYIC); and uroplakin III (CATSHDSQITQEAVPK). The underlined, terminal cysteine residues were added so that these peptides could be conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin or bovine serum albumin using m-maleimidobenzoyl-N-hydroxysuccinimide ester as a cross-linking reagent. The carrier-peptide conjugates were used to immunize rabbits as described earlier (Wu and Sun, 1993). Bifunctional cross-linking reagents, including EGS, sulfo-EGS, and DFDNB, were purchased from Pierce. They were dissolved immediately before use in dry Me2SO to make a 25 mM stock solution (Abdella et al., 1979), aliquots of which were then added to a membrane suspension containing 0.1 mg of protein per ml of 10 mM Hepes/NaOH buffer (pH 7.5). After 2 h at room temperature, the reaction was quenched by adding 1 M Tris/HCl (pH 7.4) to a final concentration of 50 mM. The cross-linked reaction mixtures were stored at −20°C until further analysis. EGS cross-linked membrane proteins were dissolved in 1% SDS, separated by SDS-PAGE on a 17% polyacrylamide gel (acrylamide/bisacrylamide ratio, 120:1), and stained with Coomassie Blue followed by destaining in 50% methanol and 7% acetic acid. The lanes containing cross-linked proteins were incubated in 1 M NH2OH in 50 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 8.5) at 37°C for 6 h. The gel piece was then equilibrated in SDS sample buffer (50 mM Tris/HCl, pH 6.8; 2% SDS; 10% glycerol, and 5%β-mercaptoethanol) at room temperature for 30 min and subjected to a second dimensional SDS-PAGE (same condition as the first dimension). The polyacrylamide gel was fixed in a solution containing 50% methanol and 7% acetic acid for 2 h, soaked in 10% glutaraldehyde for 30 min, washed extensively in distilled water, and then exposed to 20% silver nitrate dissolved in 0.4% NaOH, 0.1% NH4OH, and 2% ethanol for 8 min. After washing in distilled water for 1 h, the gel was incubated in a solution containing 0.02% formaldehyde, 10% ethanol, and 0.005% citric acid. For immunoblotting, proteins separated by SDS-PAGE were electrophoretically transferred to a nitrocellulose paper. After the unoccupied sites of the paper were blocked with 5% milk in phosphate-buffered saline, the paper was incubated with rabbit antibodies against individual uroplakins followed by a peroxidase-conjugated goat-anti-rabbit antibody (Surya et al., 1990). We showed previously that by using a combination of differential centrifugation and selective removal of contaminating non-AUM vesicles with certain detergents, we could isolate large quantities of highly purified bovine urothelial AUMs (Wu et al., 1990, 1994). Although these AUMs morphologically resembled the urothelial plaques found in situ, we could not rule out the possibility that the isolation procedure, which involved relatively harsh treatments such as washing with Sarkosyl and a high pH solution, might have altered the AUM structure. We also could not rule out the possibility that certain AUM-associated proteins might have been stripped off. To alleviate these problems, we decided to begin by analyzing the neighboring relationship of the uroplakins in native urothelial membranes that had not experienced the detergent/alkaline treatments. We could accomplish this by isolating crude membranes from bovine urothelium, cross-linking their proteins using EGS, a bifunctional reagent that cross-links neighboring amino groups, and monitoring the cross-linked status of individual uroplakins by immunoblotting. A prerequisite of this approach was the availability of antibodies that were monospecific for individual uroplakin molecules. We therefore raised a panel of rabbit antisera against synthetic peptides corresponding to sequences of the four major uroplakins. Immunoblotting established that all these antisera reacted strongly with their respective uroplakins (Fig. 1). Antisera to uroplakins Ia, II, and III recognized well defined 27-, 15-, and 47-kDa protein bands, respectively (Fig. 1b). Antisera to uroplakin Ib recognized multiple bands in the molecular mass range of 25 to 28 kDa; however, this apparent heterogeneity could be completely accounted for by glycosylation (Wu et al., 1994; Yu et al., 1994). Moreover, at least one antiserum for each uroplakin was shown to recognize, specifically, only the corresponding uroplakin in the crude urothelial membrane fraction (Fig. 1). These monospecific antisera enabled us to monitor the cross-linking status of the uroplakins that were present in crude urothelial membranes that had been treated with various concentrations of EGS (Fig. 2). This experiment revealed the formation of three well defined, cross-linked uroplakin species. A new 22-kDa band was recognized only by the uroplakin II antibody and was therefore presumably a UPII homodimer; a 35-kDa band was recognized by antisera to both UPII and UPIa and was thus likely a heterodimer of UPIa and UPII; and finally a 72-kDa band reacted with antisera to both UPIb and UPIII, suggesting a UPIb/UPIII heterodimer (Fig. 2). Similar results were obtained using a hydrophilic analogue of EGS, the sulfo-EGS, although the yield of the UPIa/UPII heterodimer was greatly reduced (Fig. 3).Figure 3:Cross-linking of crude urothelial membranes using hydrophobic versus hydrophilic bifunctional cross-linking reagents. Crude bovine urothelial membranes were cross-linked with (a) EGS and (b) its hydrophilic analog, sulfo-EGS (S-EGS). The proteins of these cross-linked membranes were separated by SDS-PAGE and subjected to immunoblotting using anti-UPIa and anti-UPII, as indicated. Note that these two reagents are equally effective in generating the 22-kDa UPII homodimer (II/II); however, only the hydrophobic EGS yielded the UPIa/II heterodimer. The positions of various uroplakin monomers and dimers are marked on the sides.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To see whether the same topological relationships existed in the purified AUMs, we prepared a batch of bovine AUMs that had been washed with Sarkosyl. As we showed earlier, these isolated AUMs contained predominantly the 27-kDa UPIa, the 28-kDa UPIb, the 15-kDa UPII, and the 47-kDa UPIII (Fig. 1a, lane 2; Table 1) (Lin et al., 1994; Wu et al., 1994; Yu et al., 1994). An additional wash of these AUMs with 25 mM NaOH further reduced the level of two minor contaminant bands of 68 and 34 kDa (Fig. 1a, lanes 2 and 3). Immunoblotting of these purified AUM preparations revealed a 48-kDa, UPIa-related protein (Fig. 4a, lanes 1 and 2), which as we had reported earlier represented a homodimer of UPIa which was found in various quantities in AUM preparations (Wu et al., 1994) (also see below). Cross-linking of these AUM preparations using EGS resulted in the formation of a 22-kDa UPII homodimer, a 35-kDa UPIa/UPII heterodimer, and a 48-kDa UPIa/UPIa homodimer (Fig. 4), thus confirming and extending some of the crude membrane data (Figure 2:, Figure 3:).Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab So far we identified the cross-linked uroplakin species based on their relative sizes and their immunoreactivities with various antibodies to uroplakins. To confirm these assignments, we resolved the cross-linked AUM proteins by SDS-PAGE, cut out the entire gel lane containing the cross-linked uroplakins, cleaved them by incubating the gel strip in 1 M NH2OH, and resolved the released uroplakins by a second dimensional SDS-PAGE. In this procedure, only the monomers that were released from a cross-linked product during the hydroxylamine step would migrate below the diagonal (Fig. 5a). Such an analysis revealed the existence of a 35-kDa, EGS cross-linked species which was cleaved by a hydroxylamine releasing a 27-kDa uroplakin Ia plus a 15-kDa uroplakin II (Fig. 5; see the circled protein spots connected by a dashed line), thus confirming the identity of the UPIa/UPII heterodimer. The results also clearly established the presence of a 22-kDa cross-linked product that, upon hydroxylamine treatment, released only a 15-kDa uroplakin II, thus confirming the identity of the uroplakin II homodimer (Fig. 5; dotted line). Finally, we observed a series of UPIa oligomers of 48 kDa (dimer) and 70 kDa (trimer), which apparently were formed during the hydroxylamine treatment (Fig. 5, a, horizontal arrows, and b). We have shown recently using image enhancement techniques that each of the six outer domains of the 16-nm protein particle of AUMs is actually “connected,” via some fine bridges, with an outer domain of a neighboring particle, and we proposed that this extensive network of inter-particle connections may account for the remarkable insolubility of AUMs in a large number of detergents including Nonidet P-40, CHAPS, deoxycholate, and Sarkosyl (Wu, et al., 1990; Walz et al., 1995). The AUMs could be solubilized, however, to some extent by Triton X-100 and almost completely by octyl glucoside (Wu et al., 1990). It would therefore be of interest to see whether these latter two detergents can disrupt, perhaps to different degrees, certain uroplakin interactions as defined by cross-linking. To test this, we treated both crude urothelial membranes and highly purified AUMs with these two detergents and cross-linked the uroplakins using EGS. Immunoblotting showed that Triton X-100 had negligible effects on uroplakin cross-linkings (Fig. 6, a and b, and 7). In contrast, octyl glucoside greatly reduced the yield of cross-linking of the uroplakin II homodimer, even though it had almost no effect on the formation of the UPIa/UPII heterodimer (Fig. 6, a and b, and 7). To assess the relative distance of the cross-linked ε-lysine groups, we treated purified AUMs with DFDNB, which has an arm length of only 3 Å (versus the 16 Å of EGS and sulfo-EGS). Like EGS, DFDNB cross-linked the UPIa/UPII heterodimer and UPIa/UPIa homodimer. However, it failed to cross-link the UPII/UPII dimer (Fig. 6c), suggesting that the ε-lysines in UPII/UPII cross-linking were >3 Å apart. We have probed the topographical relationship of the uroplakins in the asymmetrical unit membrane using bifunctional cross-linking reagents. The results that we have obtained so far have several important features. First, we identified the same set of cross-linked uroplakin dimers, regardless whether we used the purified AUMs (Figure 4:, Figure 5:), or the crude urothelial membranes (Figure 2:, Figure 3:), as our starting material. This suggests that the topographical relationships that exist in the relatively unperturbed, crude urothelial membranes must have been maintained to a large extent in our purified AUMs. Second, the cross-linking patterns were highly reproducible over a wide range of experimental conditions covering different types and concentrations of the cross-linking reagents (Figure 2:, Figure 3:, Figure 4:, Figure 5:). Moreover, the cross-linking was highly efficient capable of capturing >30% of the uroplakin monomers using the reagent concentrations that we have tested (Figure 2:, Figure 3:, Figure 4:), thus making it less likely that we are observing the cross-linking of uroplakins entrapped in a minor AUM conformation. Third, the cross-linking of purified AUMs resulted in the formation of only a few, major protein complexes that have been identified as containing purely uroplakins. Thus the cross-linking of UPIa with EGS yielded almost exclusively the UPIa•UPII complex, and UPII yielded predominantly the UPIa/UPII heterodimer and the UPII homodimer (Figure 2:, Figure 3:, Figure 4:). Such a relatively simple cross-linking pattern of the purified AUMs is perhaps to be expected, given the fact that AUMs are known to contain only four major protein subunits (Wu et al., 1990, 1994; Yu et al., 1994). It was unexpected, however, that crude urothelial membranes yielded no additional cross-linked species, although of course this negative finding does not rule out additional protein:protein interactions that may exist in situ. Taken together, our results strongly suggest that the uroplakin pairs that we have identified so far by the cross-linking approach reflect important protein:protein interactions that occur in the asymmetrical unit membrane. Our data thus established the existence of several uroplakin pairs including homodimers and heterodimers. In addition, we found that UPIa has a tendency to oligomerize, forming complexes that are stable in SDS. The fact that UPIa and UPIb, two structurally related molecules, were cross-linked to two different uroplakin partners indicated a high degree of specificity in uroplakin interaction. The apparent molecular weights of various uroplakin monomers and cross-linked dimers are summarized in Table 1. This cross-linked pair ran as a well defined, 35-kDa band during SDS-PAGE (Figure 2:, Figure 3:, Figure 4:, Figure 5:, Figure 6:, Figure 7:; Table 1); it reacted strongly with antisera to uroplakins Ia and II (Figure 2:, Figure 3:, Figure 4:); and it was cleaved by hydroxylamine giving rise to UPIa and UPII (Fig. 5). The apparent molecular weight of this cross-linked product was slightly smaller than the sum of its monomers (35 kDa versus 42 kDa), which is a common occurrence. The fact that this UPIa/UPII heterodimer was detected as a major cross-linked product of not only the purified AUMs, but also the crude urothelial membranes (Figure 2:, Figure 3:, Figure 4:), suggests that the UPIa:UPII interaction that is detected here via the cross-linking reaction is likely to be physiological. This uroplakin pair can even be generated with DFDNB, a much shorter cross-linking reagent with an arm length of only 3Å (versus 16 Å of EGS; Fig. 6c), suggesting a close proximity of the cross-linked ε-amino groups. On the other hand, the hydrophilic analogue of EGS, i.e. the sulfo-EGS, failed to cross-link this particular uroplakin pair, even though it could efficiently cross-link some other uroplakins (see below). This suggests that the reactive lysines may be embedded at least in part in a hydrophobic environment. Taken together, these results clearly established that uroplakin Ia, a member of the TM4 superfamily, interacts closely with uroplakin II, a 15-kDa “type I” integral membrane protein that is anchored into the lipid bilayer via its single transmembrane domain located at its C terminus (Lin et al., 1994). This cross-linked species ran as a well defined band of 22-kDa during SDS-PAGE (Figure 2:, Figure 3:, Figure 4:; Table 1), it reacted with only anti-UPII (Figure 2:, Figure 3:, Figure 4:, Figure 5:), and it was cleaved by hydroxylamine yielding exclusively a monomeric UPII (Fig. 5). Both EGS and its hydrophilic analogue, the sulfo-EGS, worked well in generating this UPII homodimer (Fig. 3), indicating that the cross-linking reaction was relatively insensitive to the hydrophobicity of the cross-linking reagent. On the other hand, this dimer formation was highly dependent on the chain length of the cross-linking reagent; while EGS and S-EGS (16 Å) worked well, the shorter DFDNB (3 Å) was ineffective (Fig. 6c). Interestingly, the cross-linking of UPII homodimer was abolished by octyl glucoside, which could effectively dissolve the AUMs, but this cross-linking was only marginally affected by Triton X-100 that only partially solubilized the AUMs. These results indicate that UPII is involved in two different kinds of protein:protein interactions. Its binding to UPIa is short-ranged as they can be cross-linked not only by EGS but also by the 3 Å DFDNB, and this binding is relatively strong as it is stable in octyl glucoside. In contrast, the binding of UPII to another UPII is relatively distant as the cross-linking required a long-armed reagent, and the binding is relatively weak as it can be disrupted by octyl glucoside. This raises the possibility that UPII interacts with UPIa within a 16-nm particle, but with UPII of perhaps another particle (see below). This also raises the possibility that a detergent's ability to break the UPII:UPII interaction, which may be involved in bridging the neighboring 16-nm particles (see below), enables the detergent to solubilize the AUMs. Some integral membrane proteins can form complexes that are so stable that they migrate as well defined oligomers during SDS-PAGE (Lemmon et al., 1992; Treutlein et al., 1992; Arkin et al., 1994). An example of this is glycophorin A which forms a dimer. This dimer formation involves the precise packing of some of the amino acid side chains of the single transmembrane domain, as it can be abolished by even relatively conserved mutations of some of these side chains (Treutlein et al., 1992). Another example is phospholamban, a cardiac ion channel, which can oligomerize forming up to a pentamer that is stable in SDS (Arkin et al., 1994). We have described earlier that heating the AUM proteins can cause the uroplakins Ia and Ib to form large aggregates, although this process was difficult to control (Wu et al., 1990). We found now, quite unexpectedly, that incubating the UPIa monomer in 1 M NH2OH resulted in the formation of well defined UPIa dimers and trimers (Figure 4:, Figure 5:). The propensity of UPIa, which may occupy the inner six domains of the 16-nm protein particle (see below), to oligomerize may play a role in AUM assembly. An interesting feature of UPIb and UPIII, that distinguishes them from UPIa and UPII, is that the former can be cross-linked much more efficiently than the latter. Thus 0.5-1 mM EGS, which barely cross-linked UPIa and UPII, yielded a nearly maximal amount of UPIb/UPIII heterodimer (Fig. 2, c and d). Increasing the EGS concentration to 2-5 mM led to the complete cross-linking of UPIb to form a homodimer and higher oligomers, the significant cross-linking of UPIII to form a homodimer, and the disappearance of the UPIb/UPIII heterodimer most likely due to its conversion to higher oligomers (Fig. 2). Although these cross-linked species had not been characterized as thoroughly as those involving UPIa and UPII, our data clearly showed that UPIb and UPIII, which could be cross-linked extremely efficiently to themselves and to each other, were not cross-linked to UPIa and UPII (Figure 2:, Figure 3:, Figure 4:). That UPIa and UPIb, two closely related members of the TM4 family, were cross-linked to different partners in AUMs raised the interesting possibility that they played different roles in AUM formation (see below). Perhaps one of the most intriguing aspects of AUM structure is: why do AUMs have two closely related UPIa and UPIb which share 39% of their amino acid sequences (Yu et al., 1994), as well as two “type I proteins,” the UPII and UPIII, which share a stretch of 12 amino acids located on the extracellular side of their single transmembrane domains (Wu and Sun, 1993; Lin et al., 1994)? Another intriguing feature has to do with protein stoichiometry. Given the highly organized structure of AUM, one expects a precise and fixed stoichiometry of its protein subunits. Although as we have pointed out recently, the significantly different color yields of uroplakins when stained with Coomassie Blue and silver nitrate complicate their quantitation (Wu et al., 1994), it now appears that the ratio of various uroplakins is quite variable. With these questions in mind, it is interesting to note that the four uroplakins form two pairs as defined by the two known (cross-linked) heterodimers, i.e. UPIa/UPII and UPIb/UPIII. Each of these dimers consists of a four transmembrane-domained member (UPIa or UPIb) plus a single transmembrane-domained protein (UPII or UPIII). Although all of the uroplakins appear to be able to form oligomers (Figure 2:, Figure 3:, Figure 4:, Figure 5:) (Wu and Sun, 1993; Wu et al., 1994), so far we have not found conditions under which we can cross-link UPIa to UPIII (instead of UPII), or UPIb to UPII (instead of UPIII), suggesting a specificity in uroplakin interaction that was not suspected previously. This specificity raises the possibility that AUMs, despite the fact that they appear to be morphologically homogeneous, may actually contain two distinct populations of 16-nm protein particles, one composed of UPIa and UPII, and another of UPIb and UPIII (Fig. 8). As we and others have shown earlier, each 16-nm particle of the AUM can be resolved into 12 stain-excluding domains, that are arranged in an inner ring of six and outer ring of six (Hicks and Ketterer, 1969, 1970; Vergara et al., 1969; Robertson and Vergara, 1980; Brisson and Wade, 1983; Walz et al., 1995). Taylor and Robertson(1984) calculated that the volume of each inner domain is 1.6 times larger than that of an outer domain. If indeed there exist two types of 16-nm particles, one of them consisting of UPIa and UPII, it would be interesting to consider a model in which each (larger) inner domain contains a 27-kDa UPIa, while each (smaller) outer domain contains a 15-kDa UPII (Fig. 8a). Since this model depicts a central ring of six interconnected UPIa molecules (Fig. 8a), this attaches a possible significance to the observation that UPIa has a propensity to form dimers, trimers, and higher oligomers that are stable even in SDS (Fig. 5a, horizontal arrows). Since, as we have shown recently, each outer domain is connected via some fine “bridges” to an outer domain of a neighboring 16-nm particle (Walz et al., 1995), this model predicts the cross-linking of UPIIs from two neighboring 16-nm particles resulting in the formation of dimers but no higher oligomers (Fig. 8a), which is indeed what we observed (Figure 2:, Figure 3:, Figure 4:, Figure 5:). Also, since this kind of UPII dimer formation involves protein:protein interactions across two neighboring 16-nm particles (Fig. 8a), one may expect that this requires a longer armed cross-linking reagent and is more susceptible to detergent disruption than the formation of UPIa/UPII dimer which involves only intraparticle interactions; this is indeed what we observed (Figure 6:, Figure 7:). This kind of consideration also suggests that the UPIa/UPII particles are not intermixed, within a single plaque, with the other kind of UPIb/UPIII particles, because if that were the case we should see the cross-linking of UPII of one particle to the UPIII of a neighboring particle, and we have not yet seen that. This raises the possibility that there are two types of urothelial plaques, one consists purely of 16-nm particles containing UPIa and UPII, while the other consists of particles containing UPIb and UPIII. This hypothesis is schematically depicted in a working model, shown in Fig. 8, that can account for all of the available data. This model is attractive because it can solve two puzzles. It can explain the redundancy of uroplakins, as the two TM4 family members, i.e. the UPIa and Ib, may actually interact with different partners and thus play related but distinct roles in AUM formation. This hypothesis can also solve the stoichiometry puzzle, because it now predicts a molar relationship of UPIa = UPII and UPIb = UPIII, thus allowing variations in the overall stoichiometry, depending on the ratio of the two types of AUM plaques. In addition, this model predicts that the two types of AUMs may play different biological roles in terminally differentiated urothethelial cells. For example, since of all the known uroplakins only the UPIII has a long cytoplasmic domain, this uroplakin may play a role in anchoring the AUM plaques into a cytoskeletal network (Wu and Sun, 1993). Is it then possible that only the UPIb/UPIII plaques can bind to the cytoskeleton? Since uroplakin II is the only AUM protein that has a long preprosequence, we need to consider the possibility that the UPII prosequence may be involved in regulating AUM assembly in the Golgi (Lin et al., 1994). Is it then possible that the assembly of the UPIa/UPII plaques is regulated differently from that of the other kind of plaques? Additional experiments are obviously needed to further study the possible heterogeneity of AUMs and to address some of the questions raised herein. Our finding that UPIa, a TM4 protein, can form a specific complex with a small integral membrane protein, the UPII, is not unique among the TM4 proteins. For example, the 26-kDa TAPA-1 is known to interact with a 16-kDa Leu-13 antigen in leukocytes and activated endothelial cells (Takahashi et al., 1990; Matsumoto et al., 1993). In another instance, a 24-kDa CD9 has been shown to bind to a 14.5-kDa diphtheria toxin receptor (DTR) which can also serve as the precursor of a heparin-binding EGF-like growth factor (HB-EGF/DTR) (Mitamura et al., 1992; Brown et al., 1993; Iwamoto et al., 1994). In addition to enhancing the diphtheria toxin binding to its receptor, CD9 can potentiate the juxtacrine growth factor activity of membrane-bound HB-EGF/DTR (Higashiyama et al., 1995). These results suggest that although TM4 proteins themselves lack an appreciable cytoplasmic domain, some of them can modulate the biological function of another integral membrane protein that has a cytoplasmic domain. Interestingly, the HB-EGF/DTR and UPII precursor, both of which bind to TM4 proteins, share some structural features (Naglich et al., 1992; Lin et al., 1994). Both have a cleavable signal peptide, followed by a prosequence that can potentially be removed by furin-like enzymes, both possess a single transmembrane domain located near the C terminus of the mature protein, and both are relatively basic (pro-UPII and HB-EGF have pI of 11.1 and 9.9, respectively). Whether these limited structural similarities are significant, or are merely coincidental, is currently unknown. Imai and Yoshie(1993) have shown that CD81 and CD82, which coexist in T cells, can be coimmunoprecipitated, suggesting that they interact with each other forming a complex. Our finding that UPIa and UPIb, two members of the TM4 family, interact with different partners in AUM was therefore unexpected. Taken together, these data indicate that members of the TM4 family, although structurally related, have diverse structural and functional properties. In conclusion, we have shown that the four major structural proteins of AUM, i.e. uroplakins Ia, Ib, II, and III, can be divided into two pairs consisting of UPIa/UPII and UPIb/UPIII. We propose that these two uroplakin pairs can form two types of 16-nm protein particles that may assemble into plaques with different assembly and functional properties. This model can account for all the existing data, and it can explain several previously puzzling features of the AUM. Moreover, it makes specific predictions that can be tested experimentally. For example, it would now be interesting to determine whether antibodies monospecific for individual uroplakins (see, e.g.Fig. 1) would decorate only a subset of urothelial plaques, whether antibodies to UPIa and UPIb would preferentially associate with the inner domains while those against UPII and UPIII with the outer domains of some of the 16-nm AUM particles, and whether one can reconstitute the 16-nm protein particles with specific pairs of uroplakins (e.g. UPIa plus UPII). Regardless to what extent the current model will prove to be correct, these experiments should greatly advance our understanding on the structure and function of AUM, a fascinating and truly unique biomembrane.

https://openalex.org/W2043247983,"The template and coactivator requirements for synergistic transcription directed by a single activator, Bicoid (BCD), bound to multiple sites have been determined. Mutagenesis studies in combination with protein binding experiments and reconstituted transcription reactions identified two independent activation domains of BCD that target different coactivator subunits (TAFII110 and TAFII60) of the basal transcription factor IID (TFIID). The presence of both coactivators is required for BCD to recruit the TATA binding protein (TBP)-TAF complex to the promoter and direct synergistic activation of transcription. Thus, contact between multiple activation domains of BCD and different targets within the TFIID complex can mediate transcriptional synergism."

https://openalex.org/W2106608011,"The sequence of biosynthetic steps from phosphatidylserine to phosphatidylethanolamine (via decarboxylation) and then phosphatidylcholine (via methylation) is linked to the intracellular transport of these aminoglycerophospholipids. Using a [3H]serine precursor and permeabilized yeast cells, it is possible to follow the synthesis of each of the aminoglycerophospholipids and examine the requirements for their interorganelle transport. This experimental approach reveals that in permeabilized cells newly synthesized phosphatidylserine is readily translocated to the locus of phosphatidylserine decarboxylase 1 in the mitochondria but not to the locus of phosphatidylserine decarboxylase 2 in the Golgi and vacuoles. Phosphatidylserine transport to the mitochondria is ATP independent and exhibits no requirements for cytosolic factors. The phosphatidylethanolamine formed in the mitochondria is exported to the locus of the methyltransferases (principally the endoplasmic reticulum) and converted to phosphatidylcholine. The export of phosphatidylethanolamine requires ATP but not any other cytosolic factors and is not obligately coupled to methyltransferase activity. The above described lipid transport reactions also occur in permeabilized cells that have been disrupted by homogenization, indicating that the processes are extremely efficient and may be dependent upon stable structural elements between organelles.

The above described lipid transport reactions also occur in permeabilized cells that have been disrupted by homogenization, indicating that the processes are extremely efficient and may be dependent upon stable structural elements between organelles. In yeast as well as in higher eukaryotes, the endoplasmic reticulum and the inner mitochondrial membrane are generally accepted as the major sites of membrane glycerophospholipid biosynthesis (Bishop and Bell, 1988; Zinser et al., 1991). Other organelles are largely devoid of phospholipid-synthesizing enzymes. This segregation of lipid-synthesizing activity necessitates efficient interorganelle transport to maintain membrane lipid composition, integrity, and function. Several mechanisms of intracellular lipid translocation (for reviews, see Bishop and Bell(1988), van Meer(1989), Trotter and Voelker(1994)) have been proposed including 1) spontaneous and protein-facilitated transport of monomeric phospholipids through the cytosol; 2) vesicle budding, translocation, and fusion; 3) regulated organelle juxtaposition and/or contact. Currently there is sufficient evidence to implicate each of the proposed mechanisms depending upon the donor and acceptor membrane and the lipid transferred. The topological segregation of yeast enzymes involved in aminoglycerophospholipid synthesis: phosphatidylserine synthase in the endoplasmic reticulum or closely related membranes (Zinser et al., 1991; Gaigg et al., 1995); phosphatidylserine decarboxylase 1 in mitochondria and phosphatidylserine decarboxylase 2 in the Golgi and vacuole (Trotter et al., 1995); and phosphatidylethanolamine methyltransferases in the endoplasmic reticulum (Kuchler et al., 1986), enables the sequential metabolism of phosphatidylserine → phosphatidylethanolamine → phosphatidylcholine to be used to follow interorganelle lipid transport. This technique has been applied to intact and permeabilized mammalian cells, as well as to isolated organelles (for a review, see Trotter and Voelker(1994)). The rate of phosphatidylserine transfer to mitochondria was greatly reduced by ATP depletion in intact cells (Voelker, 1985) and stimulated by ATP addition in permeabilized cells (Voelker, 1989b, 1990, 1993). Interorganelle translocation of phosphatidylserine was shown to be largely independent of soluble cytosolic proteins in permeabilized mammalian cells (Voelker, 1989b) and in a cell free system (Voelker, 1989a). Membrane collision and/or vesicle flux have been suggested as possible mechanisms of this transport process. Membrane contact of mitochondria with a phospholipid-synthesizing microsomal fraction (Vance, 1990; Ardail et al., 1993; Gaigg et al., 1995) is probably the basis of lipid transport between these two organelles. Work with disrupted permeabilized mammalian cells provided evidence that structural elements coupling a donor membrane compartment to the mitochondria were involved in phosphatidylserine transport (Voelker, 1993). The use of [3H]serine metabolism to [3H]phosphatidylethanolamine as a specific measure of phosphatidylserine transport to the mitochondria has come under closer scrutiny as a result of the recent finding that there are two phosphatidylserine decarboxylases, one in the mitochondria (PSD1) (Trotter et al., 1993; Clancey et al., 1993) and the other in the Golgi apparatus and the vacuole (PSD2) (Trotter and Voelker, 1995; Trotter et al., 1995). The availability of well defined psd1 and psd2 mutants (Trotter et al., 1993, 1995; Trotter and Voelker, 1995) now makes it possible to evaluate which transport pathways are being followed in the metabolism of nascent phosphatidylserine. In this report we describe the optimization of the permeabilized yeast cell technique in order to 1) define the requirements for aminoglycerophospholipid synthesis and transport, 2) discriminate between nascent phosphatidylserine transport to the mitochondria and Golgi plus vacuoles, and 3) define the energetic requirements for phosphatidylserine transport to, and phosphatidylethanolamine transport from, the mitochondria. We present evidence that the PSD1 gene product catalyzes synthesis of the vast majority of cellular phosphatidylethanolamine via decarboxylation in permeabilized cells. The wild-type yeast strains Saccharomyces cerevisiae X-2180 (aSUC2 mal gal2 CUP1) and S. cerevisiae 422 (αtrp1-289 leu2-3, 112 his7 lys2) (kindly provided by Dr. R. Sclafani, Denver) and the phosphatidylserine decarboxylase-deficient yeast strains PTY13 (αtrp1 leu2 his lys2 psd1-Δ1::TRP1), PTY22 (atrp1 leu2 his ade1 lys2 psd2), and PTY18 (atrp1 leu2 his ade1 psd1-Δ1::TRP1 psd2) were grown on YPD medium (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 3% glucose) under aerobic conditions at 30°C to an A600 of 2-4. The PTY18 strain was additionally supplemented with 2 mM ethanolamine. Yeast spheroplasts were prepared by the method of Daum et al.(1982) with the modification that YPD (0.5% glucose) was present during treatment of cells with zymolyase. Permeabilized yeast cells were prepared essentially as described by Baker et al.(1988) with minor modifications. In brief, spheroplasts regenerated for 20 min at 30°C in the presence of 0.75% yeast extract, 1.5% peptone, 1% glucose, and 0.7 M sorbitol were washed with lysis buffer consisting of 0.4 M sorbitol, 20 mM HEPES, pH 6.8, 0.15 M potassium acetate, 2 mM magnesium acetate, and 0.5 mM EGTA. Then, spheroplasts were suspended in the lysis buffer at a concentration of approximately 0.5 g wet weight per ml. The suspension was divided into 0.2-0.3-ml portions, filled in Eppendorf tubes, and frozen over liquid nitrogen. Freezing was complete within 15 min. At this stage, cells were stored at −75°C, and used within the next 3 months. For thawing, the Eppendorf tubes with the cell suspension were placed on ice, and this resulted in an optimal degree of cell permeabilization, but left organelles largely intact. During all following steps care was taken to minimize mechanical shear forces. The degree of permeabilization was evaluated by microscopic inspection, marker enzyme measurements, and Western blotting. For the latter procedure, 20 μl of the suspension of permeabilized cells were diluted with 0.98 ml of 1.2 M sorbitol and centrifuged for 5 min at 4°C at 6,500 rpm in an Eppendorf tabletop centrifuge. The supernatant, which should contain only the cytosol, and the pellet, which should contain permeabilized cells, were tested with antibodies against cytosolic glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, mitochondrial porin, 40-kDa microsomal protein, Kex2 protease, and carboxypeptidase Y. The cytosolic marker enzyme glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase was measured by the the method of Byers(1982), and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase by the method of Deutsch(1983). In standard preparations, the degree of permeabilization was found to be approximately 85-95% as judged from the remaining cytosol in the cellular pellet. Organelles probed with antibodies mentioned above were more or less completely recovered in permeabilized cells in the pellet. Intactness of mitochondria was tested using an antibody against cytochrome b2, an intermembrane space protein (Daum et al., 1982), and found to be unaffected by the cell permeabilization procedure. Cell homogenates were prepared by suspending permeabilized yeast cells in 0.6 M mannitol, 10 mM Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (0.2 mg of protein per ml), and disrupting with 10 strokes in a Dounce homogenizer. Mitochondria and microsomal fractions were prepared as described elsewhere (Daum et al., 1982; Zinser et al., 1991). A typical assay mixture for 8 time points to be taken contained 2 mg of cellular protein (permeabilized cells) in a total volume of 0.9 ml. The assay mixture consisted of 90 μl of 6 mM MnCl2, 90 μl of water, 195 μl of 1.2 M sorbitol, 400 μl of assay buffer (0.6 M mannitol, 50 mM TrisCl, pH 8.0), and 50 μl of permeabilized yeast cells (0.5 g wet weight per ml). Permeabilized cells were added last to avoid an osmotic shock. The reaction was started by the addition of 45 μl of 2 mM unlabeled serine and 30 μl of [3H]serine (specific activity 15-40 Ci/mmol; 30 μCi in 0.9-ml assay volume). The incubation temperature was 30°C, and samples of 0.1 ml were taken at the time points indicated. Under these conditions, synthesis of phosphatidylserine occurred. After 15 min of incubation, EDTA (stock solution: 0.1 M in 0.6 M mannitol, 50 mM TrisCl, pH 8.0) was added to a final concentration of 4 mM. EDTA stopped the synthesis of phosphatidylserine and stimulated the synthesis of phosphatidylethanolamine. Samples of 0.1 ml plus the aliquot volume of added EDTA were taken in this second phase. After 15 min of further incubation, MgCl2 (final concentration 8 mM) and S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet 1The abbreviation used is: AdoMetS-adenosylmethionine ; final concentration 0.23 mM) were added. A stock solution of 10 mM AdoMet was prepared by dissolving an appropriate amount of AdoMet in 0.6 M mannitol, 50 mM Tris-Cl and adjusting to pH 8.0 with Tris base. The AdoMet stock solution was freshly prepared for every experiment. MgCl2 was prepared as a 0.1 M stock solution in 0.6 M mannitol, 50 mM Tris-Cl, pH 7.5. In the presence of MgCl2 and AdoMet, phosphatidylcholine was synthesized. Samples of 0.1 ml plus the aliquot volumes of added EDTA, MgCl2, and AdoMet were taken in the third phase of the incubation. S-adenosylmethionine MgATP or MnATP, an ATP-regenerating system (10 units of creatine phosphokinase per mg of protein and 5 mM creatine phosphate), N-ethylmaleimide, adriamycin, apyrase, oligomycin, and azide were added at final concentrations as indicated in Table 2. Permeabilized cells were preincubated with MgATP and inhibitors for 5 min on ice and with apyrase for 30 min at 30°C. In order to remove cytosol, permeabilized cells were washed twice with 0.2 ml of lysis buffer and reisolated by centrifugation at 1,000 × g for 30 s in an Eppendorf tabletop centrifuge. The same washing procedure was employed to remove apyrase from permeabilized cells. Subsequently, cells were carefully suspended in the respective incubation buffer.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab When radiolabeled phospholipids were localized in subcellular fractions, 3.5 mg of permeabilized cells were incubated in 1.8 ml of the assay mixture as described above. After 20, 40, and 120 min of incubation under appropriate conditions, 0.4-ml samples were taken and chilled, and 5 mM azide and fluoride and 8 mM EDTA and hydroxylamine (final concentration, each) were added. Mitochondria and 40,000 × g microsomes (2 mg of protein, each) were added as carrier, and the respective fractions were isolated by standard procedures (Daum et al., 1982; Zinser et al., 1991). Azide, fluoride, EDTA, and hydroxylamine (concentrations see above) were present throughout the isolation procedure. The purity of fractions was essentially the same as described by Zinser et al. (1991). Aliquots (0.1-0.116 ml) of the incubation mixture (see above) were extracted with 4 ml of chloroform/methanol (2:1, v/v) for 1 h at room temperature with repeated vortexing. Prior to the extraction carrier, phospholipids (approximately 50-100 μg of soybean phospholipids, Epicuron) were added. The organic phase was washed once with 2 ml of 0.034% MgCl2, once with 2 ml of 2 M KCl/methanol (4:1, v/v), and once with 2 ml of methanol/water/chloroform (48:47:3, v/v). 2 ml of the resulting organic phase were withdrawn and taken to dryness under a stream of nitrogen. Lipids were dissolved in 30 μl of chloroform/methanol (2:1, v/v) and subjected to thin layer chromatography on Silica Gel 60 (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) or Silica Gel H (Analtech, Newark, DE). Chloroform, methanol, 25% ammonia (50:25:6, v/v) or chloroform, methanol, 2-propyl alcohol, triethylamine, 0.25% KCl in water (90:27:75:54:18, v/v) were used as developing solvent. Spots were visualized in iodine vapor or by spraying the thin layer plates with 0.1% aqueous 8-anilino-1-naphthalenesulfonic acid and exposure to UV light. Individual phospholipids were identified with authentic standards, scraped from thin layer plates, and counted in 8 ml of Safety Mixture (Baker) plus 5% water or 4.5 ml of Scintisafe (Fisher) plus 0.5 ml water. Proteins were quantitated by the method of Lowry et al.(1951), or using the BCA protein assay system (Pierce). SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Laemmli, 1970) and Western blotting (Haid and Suissa, 1983) were carried out by published procedures. Immunoreactive proteins on nitrocellulose sheets were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay techniques with secondary antibodies coupled to peroxidase or alkaline phosphatase following the manufacturer's instructions. Stained bands were quantified by densitometric scanning using a Shimadzu CS 930 chromatoscanner. Cellular ATP was quantified using the firefly luciferase bioluminescence assay as described by Lundin(1982). Data shown in the figures are from one representative of at least three independent experiments. Results of these experiments were essentially the same, but absolute values varied slightly due to variance in the uptake of [3H]serine, the degree of permeabilization of spheroplasts, and the amount of cells used. Permeabilized yeast cells were used for assays only when the degree of permeabilization was higher than 80%. In contrast to mammalian cells, permeabilized yeast cells have not been as widely used to study problems of intracellular transport of macromolecules. Despite a low degree of permeabilization (approximately 50%), the yeast system yielded reliable results for the study of the protein secretory pathway (Baker et al., 1988), because externally supplied macromolecules were not able to enter intact spheroplasts and were functional in permeabilized cells only. By comparison, a low degree of permeabilization would make results presented in this study difficult to interpret, because the low molecular weight precursor of aminoglycerophospholipids, [3H]serine, can easily cross the plasma membrane of intact spheroplasts. For this reason we optimized the permeabilization procedure of yeast cells for our purposes. In brief, rates of freezing and thawing were found to strongly influence the quality and the stability of permeabilized cells. As can be seen from Table 1, the procedure outlined under “Experimental Procedures” yielded a high degree of permeabilization with minimal disruption of subcellular structures (organelles). At least 90% of the soluble enzyme glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase was released from the cells as determined by either immunoblot analysis or enzyme activity measurement. Similar results were obtained by the activity measurement of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase. Measurement of proteins associated with the mitochondrial outer membrane (porin) or the intermembrane space (cytochrome b2) detected by immunoblotting demonstrated that mitochondria were at least 90% retained in the permeabilized cell pellet. These latter results also clearly demonstrate that the structural integrity of the mitochondria were not compromised by permeabilization. Additives to the permeabilized cell preparation, e.g. EDTA or AdoMet (see below), do not gain access to organelles of intact spheroplasts. The effect of EDTA and AdoMet were apparent only in permeabilized cells and served as additional independent indicators for the degree of permeabilization.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab The synthesis of phosphatidylserine and its subsequent metabolism to phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylcholine can be followed readily using [3H]serine as a precursor. Although CDP-diacylglycerol is also required for phosphatidylserine synthesis, we found that sufficient levels of this liponucleotide were present in the permeabilized yeast cells to support the first step of aminoglycerophospholipid synthesis for at least 120 min. This situation is advantageous because it avoids the addition of exogenous CDP-diacylglycerol which has some detergent properties and can compromise organelle integrity. The synthesis of phosphatidylserine depends on the presence of divalent cations, especially of Mn2−, in the incubation mixture (Bae-Lee and Carman, 1984; Sperka-Gottlieb et al., 1990). The subsequent step in the biosynthetic pathway of aminoglycerophospholipids, the decarboxylation of phosphatidylserine leading to phosphatidylethanolamine, is inhibited by divalent cations and stimulated in the presence of EDTA (Lamping et al., 1991). Finally, conversion of phosphatidylethanolamine to phosphatidylcholine needs the addition of S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet) and the presence of Mg2− (Kodaki and Yamashita, 1989). The different optima for each step in aminoglycerophospholipid synthesis necessitated the design of a three-step assay, which fulfills all the above-mentioned requirements. In a standard experiment shown in Fig. 1(details given under “Experimental Procedures”), permeabilized yeast cells were first incubated for 15 min with [3H]serine in the presence of Mn2− to form phosphatidylserine. Subsequently, EDTA was added, and the formation of phosphatidylethanolamine was followed for another 15 min. As can be seen from Fig. 1, practically no phosphatidylethanolamine was formed during the first phase of the incubation, but the addition of EDTA stopped the synthesis of phosphatidylserine and stimulated its decarboxylation to phosphatidylethanolamine. Without addition of EDTA, no phosphatidylethanolamine was formed (data not shown). Finally, AdoMet and Mg2− were added, and the formation of phosphatidylcholine was followed for another 70 min (see Fig. 1). In control experiments carried out without AdoMet and Mg2−, no phosphatidylcholine was synthesized (data not shown). During this phase of the assay, incorporation of [3H]serine into phosphatidylserine was observed again, because phosphatidylserine synthase was reactivated in the presence of divalent cations. Phosphatidylethanolamine formation also continued under these conditions indicating that Mg2− inhibition may only be relevant in assays using solubilized enzyme. Radioactivity was not only found in phosphatidylcholine, but also in phosphatidyldimethylethanolamine and lysophosphatidylethanolamine (~5 and 10% of labeled phospholipids, respectively). For the sake of clarity, only values of phosphatidylcholine, the fully methylated end product in the sequence of biosynthetic steps of aminoglycerophospholipids, are shown (see also Fig. 1). The occurrence of phosphatidylserine decarboxylase activity in two different compartments of the yeast (Trotter et al., 1995; Trotter and Voelker, 1995) raises the possibility that phosphatidylserine destined to be converted to phosphatidylethanolamine could be translocated to the Golgi or the vacuole in addition to being imported into mitochondria. In vivo, the activity derived from the extramitochondrial gene product is sufficient for a balanced phospholipid metabolism and cellular growth (Trotter et al., 1993). In principal, the total amount of phosphatidylethanolamine required for yeast growth can be synthesized without the participation of the mitochondrial phosphatidylserine decarboxylase. In order to clarify which pathway contributes to phosphatidylethanolamine synthesis in permeabilized cells, we conducted experiments using yeast strains with psd1 (mitochondrial) and psd2 (extramitochondrial) mutations. Permeabilized cells containing the psd1 null allele (Fig. 2B) formed [3H]phosphatidylethanolamine at less than 5% of the wild-type control (Fig. 2A), and only trace amounts of phosphatidylcholine were formed. In contrast, permeabilized cells with the psd2 mutation (Fig. 2C) exhibited significant synthesis of phosphatidylethanolamine (via decarboxylation) and phosphatidylcholine. The strain with both the psd1 and psd2 mutations, which completely lacks detectable phosphatidylserine decarboxylase activity, produced radioactive phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylcholine at only background levels (Fig. 2D). These data demonstrate that the majority of phosphatidylethanolamine synthesized in permeabilized yeast cells is formed primarily by the PSD1 gene product. Thus, the appearance of phosphatidylethanolamine in these experiments likely indicates the transport of phosphatidylserine to the inner mitochondrial membrane, and not to the location of the PSD2 gene product. From the findings presented above we conclude that formation of phosphatidylethanolamine from radiolabeled phosphatidylserine is a valid measure of the import of phosphatidylserine into mitochondria. In permeabilized mammalian cells, the translocation of phosphatidylserine from its site of synthesis to its site of conversion to phosphatidylethanolamine was shown to be ATP-dependent (Voelker, 1989b, 1990, 1993) and inhibited by adriamycin (Voelker, 1991). Transport between isolated organelles or within permeabilized cells did not require cytosolic components (Voelker, 1989a, 1989b, 1990, 1993). Similar parameters were now examined with permeabilized yeast cells (Table 2). Removal of cytosol from permeabilized cells by repeated washes was shown to be without effect on the synthesis, transport, and decarboxylation of phosphatidylserine. Addition of MgATP to the assay mixture did not have a stimulatory effect on the formation of phosphatidylethanolamine. This latter result could be due to the high levels of ATP present in the spheroplasts prior to permeabilization. However, preincubation of permeabilized cells with oligomycin and apyrase which deplete cellular ATP practically to negligible levels (as measured by the luciferin-luciferase assay) was also ineffective at altering phosphatidylserine transport. The discrepancies between the mammalian and the yeast system may be attributable to differences in phosphatidylserine synthesis between the two types of cells. Yeast phosphatidylserine synthesis is a CDP-diacylglyceroldependent reaction (see Paltauf et al.(1992)), whereas the mammalian enzyme catalyzes base exchange (see Bishop and Bell, 1988). Both enzyme systems are microsomally located, but may result in different physical topology of nascent phosphatidylserine. As a consequence, the accessibility of phosphatidylserine to the lipid translocation machinery may be different, which could in turn cause different requirements for intracellular transport. In the mammalian system, ATP is required for both translocation and synthesis of phosphatidylserine (Voelker, 1990, 1993); phosphatidylserine synthesis is coupled to the action of the Ca2−-sequestering ATPase of the endoplasmic reticulum. Yeast phosphatidylserine synthase is not Ca2−-dependent. The enzymatic reaction is energy-dependent due to the requirement of CDP-diacylglycerol as a co-substrate, but is not directly affected by ATP. Permeabilized yeast cells preincubated with adriamycin exhibited a higher rate of phosphatidylserine biosynthesis than untreated cells (data not shown). However, in contrast to mammalian cells, adriamycin did not affect the import of phosphatidylserine into mitochondria of permeabilized yeast cells (see Table 2). This observation is consistent with previous findings by Simbeni et al.(1993) obtained in vitro with isolated yeast mitochondria. Adriamycin binds with high affinity to cardiolipin (Goormaghtigh et al., 1984), a lipid that is present at high concentrations in contact sites between the outer and the inner mitochondrial membrane (Ardail et al., 1990; Simbeni et al., 1991). The interaction of adriamycin with cardiolipin is one piece of evidence implicating zones of mitochondrial membrane contact as sites of protein import in yeast (Eilers et al., 1989) and phospholipid import in mammalian cells. The differential effects of adriamycin upon yeast and mammalian lipid transport remain unclear. In mammalian cells, it is possible that adriamycin affects an earlier step than contact site transit of phosphatidylserine, which may not be identical with that of the yeast system. Contact between phospholipid-synthesizing membranes and mitochondria has been suggested as a possible prerequisite for the import of phospholipids into mitochondria of mammalian cells (Voelker 1989a, 1990, 1993; Vance, 1991; Ardail et al., 1991) and yeast (Gaigg et al., 1995). In permeabilized mammalian cells that are disrupted by shearing, transport of nascent phosphatidylserine appears to be restricted by specific structural association between the mitochondria and the membrane compartment synthesizing the lipid (Voelker, 1993). As found for mammalian cells, disruption of permeabilized yeast by homogenization yields cell preparations that remain competent to synthesize, transport, and metabolize phosphatidylserine (see Table 2). Phosphatidylethanolamine formed in mitochondria by the action of phosphatidylserine decarboxylase can be further metabolized to phosphatidylcholine by the nonmitochondrial AdoMet-dependent phosphatidylethanolamine-N-methyltransferase and phospholipid-N-methyltransferase (Kuchler et al., 1986; Gaigg et al., 1995). Therefore, export of phosphatidylethanolamine from mitochondria is required to deliver the substrate to the methyltransferases. Preliminary characterization of phosphatidylethanolamine export from the mitochondria as monitored by phosphatidylcholine formation revealed it did not require cytosol and was inhibited by the addition of apyrase plus oligomycin. Additional experiments, however, demonstrated that methyltransferase activity was also markedly inhibited by apyrase plus oligomycin treatment. This latter finding made phosphatidylcholine formation an unreliable indicator for phosphatidylethanolamine export from the mitochondria in the presence of apyrase and oligomycin. In order to critically test the role of ATP in phosphatidylethanolamine export from mitochondria, we carried out subcellular fractionation of permeabilized yeast cells after each stage of incubation, i.e. after 20, 40, and 120 min of incubation under the optimized conditions for phosphatidylserine, phosphatidylethanolamine, and phosphatidylcholine synthesis. Appearance of phosphatidylethanolamine in microsomes served as an indicator of its export from mitochondria. In the presence of apyrase (Fig. 3A), phosphatidylethanolamine transport from mitochondria to microsomes was dramatically decreased. As a consequence, conversion of phosphatidylethanolamine to phosphatidylcholine could not occur (Fig. 3B). In control assays without apyrase, phosphatidylethanolamine reached the microsomal fractions and was, in part, further converted to phosphatidylcholine. This result confirmed the idea that export of phosphatidylethanolamine from mitochondria is an energy-dependent step in this part of the pathway leading to phosphatidylcholine thus confirming previous findings with intact yeast cells (Daum et al., 1986; Gnamusch et al., 1992). Data shown in Fig. 3, A and B, also demonstrate that phosphatidylcholine formed in microsomes of untreated cells can be readily transported back to mitochondria. When de-energized permeabilized yeast cells were re-energized by washing and addition of ATP, export of phosphatidylethanolamine from mitochondria and formation of phosphatidylcholine recovered (Fig. 3, C and D). Ongoing methylation of phosphatidylethanolamine was not the limiting factor of the translocation step, because in the absence of AdoMet phosphatidylethanolamine reached the endoplasmic reticulum (Fig. 3E), although further conversion to phosphatidylcholine could not occur (Fig. 3F). Thus, the methylation of phosphatidylethanolamine did not exert a feedback control on its export from mitochondria. While the precise mechanism of phospholipid translocation between organelles remains uncertain, circumstantial evidence continues to accrue in favor of membrane contact as an important prerequisite for this process. Membranes with a high capacity to synthesize phospholipids were found to be associated with mitochondria of mammalian (Vance, 1990, 1991; Ardail et al., 1991, 1993) as well as of yeast cells (Gaigg et al., 1995). In addition, Voelker(1993) demonstrated that transport and decarboxylation of phosphatidylserine in disrupted mammalian cells is restricted to those mitochondria associated with the phosphatidylserine-synthesizing membrane. The observation that homogenates obtained from permeabilized spheroplasts readily translocated phosphatidylserine and phosphatidylethanolamine between endoplasmic reticulum-related membranes and mitochondria indicates the process is very efficient in a cell-free system. One explanation of these results is that stable organelle contact might be the basis of lipid translocation. Alternatively, vesicle transport along structural corridors that tether different organelles can also be envisaged as a possible mechanism of phospholipid translocation. The role of cytosolic lipid transfer proteins (Wirtz, 1991), which catalyze lipid migration in vitro, as mediators of lipid transport in living cells still remains obscure despite extensive genetic and molecular biological studies (Bankaitis et al., 1989; 1990; Cleves et al., 1991a; 1991b) with the yeast phosphatidylinositol transfer protein. Another cytosolic yeast lipid transfer protein, which catalyzes phosphatidylserine and phosphatidylethanolamine transfer in vitro (Lafer et al., 1991), was originally regarded as a candidate to facilitate the transport of phosphatidylserine into, and of phosphatidylethanolamine out of, mitochondria. The fact that removal of cytosol from permeabilized yeast cells affects neither phosphatidylserine nor phosphatidylethanolamine translocation between the endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria argues against such a function of the phosphatidylserine transfer protein. This result is in agreement with the observation that translocation of phosphatidylserine between the endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria of mammalian cells in vitro is not stimulated by cytosolic proteins (Voelker, 1989a)."

https://openalex.org/W2041569516,"B cell-specific transcriptional promoter activity mediated by the octamer motif requires the Oct1 or Oct2 protein and additional B cell-restricted cofactors. One such cofactor, BOB.1/OBF.1, was recently isolated from human B cells. Here, we describe the isolation and detailed characterization of the murine homolog. Full-length cDNAs and genomic clones were isolated, and the gene structure was determined. Comparison of the deduced amino acids shows 88% sequence identity between mouse and human BOB.1/OBF.1. The NH2-terminal 126 amino acids of BOB.1/OBF.1 are both essential and sufficient for interaction with the POU domains of either Oct1 or Oct2. This protein-protein interaction does not require the simultaneous binding of Oct proteins to DNA, and high resolution footprinting of the Oct-DNA interaction reveals that binding of BOB.1/OBF.1 to Oct1 or Oct2 does not alter the interaction with DNA. BOB.1/OBF.1 can efficiently activate octamer-dependent promoters in fibroblasts; however, it fails to stimulate octamer-dependent enhancer activity. Fusion of subdomains of BOB.1/OBF.1 with the GAL4 DNA binding domain reveals that both NH2- and COOH-terminal domains of BOB.1/OBF.1 contribute to full transactivation function, the COOH-terminal domain is more efficient in this transactivation assay.

First, FC loading of macrophages led to the activation of membrane-bound CT without a substantial change in the activity of soluble CT(17.Shiratori Y. Okwu A.K. Tabas I. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11337-11348Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the activation cannot be explained by soluble-to-membrane CT translocation, which is a process thought to be involved in the activation of CT in certain other systems (18.Vance D.E. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1990; 68: 1151-1165Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 19.Kent C. Prog. Lipid Res. 1991; 29: 87-105Crossref Google Scholar, 20.Tijburg L.B.M. Geelen M.J.H. van Golde L.M.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 1004: 1-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Second, there was no increase in CT mRNA in FC-loaded macrophages, and stimulation of PC biosynthesis in the FC-loaded cells did not depend upon new protein synthesis(17.Shiratori Y. Okwu A.K. Tabas I. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11337-11348Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, the activation occurs via a post-translational mechanism. The goal of the present study was to explore further the mechanism of CT activation in FC-loaded macrophages. Our new data indicate that FC loading activates CT in macrophages via a signaling mechanism that appears to involve the dephosphorylation of membrane-bound CT and possibly other cellular proteins. This novel intracellular signaling effect of FC may be part of an important adaptive response of macrophages to the potential toxicity of excess FC accumulation.

Rabbit antiserum against recombinant CT was provided by Dr. Suzanne Jackowski (St. Jude Children's Research Hospital); the antigen was made by baculovirus-mediated expression of rat liver CT cDNA in Sf9 cells and then purified by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis(24.Luche M.M. Rock C.O. Jackowski S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 301: 114-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Rabbit antiserum against a synthetic N-terminal CT peptide (corresponding to amino acids 1-17 of rat liver CT) (25.Watkins J.D. Kent C. J. Biol.

Rabbit antiserum against a synthetic mid-molecule CT peptide (corresponding to amino acids 164-176 of rat liver CT) (26.Jamil H. Utal A.K. Vance D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1752-1760Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was provided by Dr. Dennis Vance (University of Alberta). Monolayer cultures of J774.A1 cells (from the American Type Culture Collection) were grown and maintained in spinner culture with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, penicillin (100 units/ml), streptomycin (100 μg/ml), and glutamine (292 μg/ml) as described previously(27.Khoo J.C. Miller E. McLoughlin P. Tabas I. Rosoff W.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 1012: 215-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 28.Okwu A.K. Xu X. Shiratori Y. Tabas I. J. Lipid Res. 1994; 35: 644-655Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). CHO-mSRAII cells, which were transfected with a murine macrophage scavenger receptor (class AII) cDNA(29.Ashkenas J. Penman M. Vasile E. Acton S. Freeman M. Krieger M. J. Lipid Res. 1993; 34: 983-1000Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), were generously provided by Dr. Monty Krieger (Massachusetts Institute of Technology). These cells were grown in monolayer culture in Ham's F-12 medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. For each experiment, the J774 or CHO-mSRAII cells were plated in 16 × 22-mm dishes at a density of 106 cells/dish in medium, 10% FCS and then incubated at 37°C in an atmosphere containing 5% CO2. After 2 h of incubation, the monolayers were washed with warm PBS and then incubated with medium,10% LPDS alone or containing acetyl-LDL, 58035, or acetyl-LDL plus 58035, as indicated in the individual figure legends. These media were replaced with fresh media of the same composition every 12 h. LDL (density, 1.020-1.063 g/ml) from fresh human plasma were isolated by preparative ultracentrifugation(21.Havel R.J. Eder H. Bragdon J. J. Clin. Invest. 1955; 34: 1345-1353Crossref PubMed Scopus (6439) Google Scholar). Acetyl-LDL was prepared by reaction with acetic anhydride as described by Goldstein and co-workers(30.Basu S.K. Goldstein J.L. Anderson R.G.W. Brown M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 73: 3178-3182Crossref PubMed Scopus (817) Google Scholar). All concentrations of lipoproteins are given in terms of their protein content with bovine serum albumin as a standard. All lipoprotein preparations were stored under argon at 4°C and used within 4 weeks. Incorporation of [3H]choline into phosphatidylcholine in intact cells was determined as described previously(17.Shiratori Y. Okwu A.K. Tabas I. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11337-11348Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For the phosphatidylcholine studies, macrophages incubated under various conditions were pulsed for 1 h with 2 μCi of [3H]choline/ml (80.0 Ci/mmol). Lipid extracts of the cells were then separated by TLC in a solvent system of chloroform methanol/acetic acid/water (50:25:8:4, v/v), and the radioactivity in phosphatidylcholine was quantified. After preincubation under control or lipid loading conditions, monolayers of J774 cells were washed three times with ice-cold PBS, and the cells were scraped with a rubber policeman into each assay buffer on ice and sonicated twice for 30 s (homogenate fraction). A portion of the cell homogenate was then centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4°C. The supernatant was collected (soluble fraction), and the pellet was resuspended in assay buffer (membrane fraction). Note that the sonication procedure disrupted the nuclei of the macrophages, as verified by DNA measurements, and so the soluble fraction included nuclear soluble contents, and the membrane fraction included nuclear membranes (cf. (25.Watkins J.D. Kent C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5686-5692Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and (31.Wang Y. Sweitzer T.D. Weinhold P.A. Kent C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5899-5904Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)). For immunoblotting, two-dimensional phosphopeptide mapping, and in vitro phosphatase treatment, the macrophages were fractionated by the digitonin treatment method of Wright et al.(32.Wright P.S. Morand J.N. Kent C. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 7919-7926Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In brief, the cell monolayers were washed three times with ice-cold PBS and then incubated for 8 min at 4°C with digitonin-release buffer, which contained 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.25 M sucrose, 0.8 mg/ml digitonin, 33 mM sodium fluoride, 33 μM sodium vanadate, 3.3 mM EDTA, 3.3 mM EGTA, 2 mM dithiothreitol, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 μg/ml pepstatin. The release buffer was then collected (soluble fraction), and the cell ghosts, still attached to the culture dish, were carefully washed once with PBS and scraped into digitonin-release buffer (membrane fraction). Homogenate fractions were prepared by scraping the monolayer in digitonin-release buffer and homogenizing the suspension by repeated aspiration and expulsion from a Pasteur pipette. CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase (EC 2.7.7.15) was assayed by measuring the incorporation of [14C]choline-phosphate into CDP-[14C]choline in membranes and soluble fractions, in the absence and presence of PC-oleic acid liposomes, respectively, as described previously(17.Shiratori Y. Okwu A.K. Tabas I. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11337-11348Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Acyl-CoA:cholesterol O-acyltransferase (ACAT) activity in microsomes isolated from macrophages was determined by measuring the incorporation of [3H]oleate from [3H]oleoyl-CoA into cholesteryl esters (33.Tabas I. Chen L.-L. Clader J.W. McPhail A.T. Burnett D.A. Bartner P. Das P.R. Pramanik B.N. Puar M.S. Feinmark S.J. Zipkin R.E. Boykow G. Vita G. Tall A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 8042-8051Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Indirect anti-CT immunofluorescence microscopy was performed as described by Watkins and Kent(25.Watkins J.D. Kent C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5686-5692Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), with a few modifications. Cells were rinsed two times with 1 ml of PBS and fixed with methanol:acetone (1:1, v/v) for 5 min at room temperature. The fixed cells were then washed five times with 1 ml of buffer A (150 mM NaCl, 20 mM HEPES, 5 mM KCl, 1 mM CaCl2, 1 mM MgCl2, pH 7.4) and then incubated as follows: 0.1 mg saponin/ml in buffer A for 30 min, buffer B (buffer A plus 5% calf serum) for 20 min, and 1:400 anti-N-terminal-CT peptide antibody in buffer B for 30 min. After removing the antibody solution, the cells were washed with and then incubated with buffer B for 15 min and then incubated with 1:200 rhodamine-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG in buffer B for 30 min. After removing the secondary antibody solution, the cells were washed with and incubated for 45 min with buffer B. Finally, the cells were rinsed three times with 1 ml of buffer B and examined by fluorescence microscopy as described in the previous section. Rhodamine was visualized with a 514-nm bandpass excitation filter, a 540-nm dichroic mirror, and a 550-nm long pass emission filter. Confocal fluorescence images were obtained with a laser confocal microscope (MRC 600, Bio-Rad Microscience, Cambridge, MA) on an inverted microscope (Axiovert; Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany) using a × 63, NA 1.4 Zeiss Plan-Apo infinity corrected objective. The illumination source for rhodamine was a 514 line from a 25-milliwatt argon laser. Immunoblot analysis of CT was performed as described by Wang et al.(34.Wang Y. MacDonald J.I.S. Kent C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5512-5518Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were scraped on ice in digitonin-release buffer, and this mixture was immediately mixed with 4-fold concentrated Laemmli sample buffer (3:1, v/v) and boiled for 5 min. The proteins were then separated by 10% reducing SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (35.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (204784) Google Scholar) using 100 μg of protein/lane; protein masses were determined by the Bio-Rad protein assay, based upon the method of Bradford(36.Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (209748) Google Scholar), using bovine serum albumin as standard. After transfer to nitrocellulose or PVDF membrane, the blots were incubated with 5% Carnation nonfat dry milk in buffer C (24 mM Tris, pH 7.4, containing 0.5 M NaCl) for 1 h at room temperature. The membrane was then incubated with the specified primary antibody in buffer D (buffer C containing 0.1% Tween 20, 3% nonfat dry milk, and 0.1% bovine serum albumin) for 3 h at room temperature. After washing four times with buffer C containing 0.1% Tween 20, the blots were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:4000) for 1 h in buffer D at room temperature. The membrane was subsequently washed twice with 0.3% Tween 20 in buffer C and twice with 0.1% Tween 20 in buffer C. Finally, the blot was soaked in the enhanced chemiluminescence reagent for 2 min and exposed to x-ray film for up to 10 min. Two-dimensional phosphopeptide mapping of CT was performed, using a modification of the methods of MacDonald and Kent (37.MacDonald J.I.S. Kent C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10529-10537Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and Hatch et al.(38.Hatch G.M. Jamil H. Utal A.K. Vance D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15751-15758Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, macrophages were plated in 100-mm culture dishes and incubated as indicated for 12 h. The cells were then washed twice with phosphate-free medium and incubated for 12 h with phosphate-free medium containing 10% LPDS, the indicated additions, and 7.5 mCi of carrier-free 32Pi/well. The cells were then washed three times with 5 ml of PBS and permeabilized with digitonin as described above. CT was immunoprecipitated as follows: soluble fractions were incubated with 90 μl of 10-fold concentrated lysis buffer (40 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, containing 400 mM NaCl, 100 mM sodium fluoride, 10 mM EDTA, 1 mM benzamidine, 0.2 mM dithiothreitol, 1 mM 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride, 20 μg leupeptin/ml, 20 μg antipain/ml, 10 μg pepstatin/ml, 10 μg chymostatin/ml, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholate, and 0.1% SDS) on ice for 30 min. Membrane fractions were resuspended in 800 μl of lysis buffer and incubated on ice for 30 min. Soluble and membrane lysate samples were precleaned with 40 μl of preimmune serum and shaken for 1 h at 4°C. This was followed by the addition of 100 μl of protein A-Sepharose CL-4B, which was prepared as follows: incubation with wash buffer (50 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 0.15 M NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholate, and 0.1% SDS) for at least 2 h, rinsing twice with wash buffer containing 1.5% bovine serum albumin, rinsing five times with wash buffer, and then resuspending in an equal volume of wash buffer. The protein A-Sepharose-lysate incubations were continued for 1 h before centrifugation in a microcentrifuge for 5 min at 14,000 rpm. The supernatants (900 μl), which were transferred to a new microcentrifuge tube, were incubated with 5 μl of anti-N-terminal CT antibody for 6 h at 4°C, with gentle agitation. Then 100 μl of precleaned protein A-Sepharose CL-4B was added, and the samples were incubated for an additional 3 h at 4°C. The beads were then centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 2 min, and the supernatant was discarded. The beads were washed six times with 1 ml of wash buffer and boiled in 100 μl of 2-fold-concentrated Laemmli buffer. The immunoprecipitated protein samples were separated on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred to a PVDF membrane as described above. The membrane was exposed to x-ray film for 15 min to detect CT. Subsequently, the radiolabeled CT bands were cut out from the membrane and carefully transferred to microcentrifuge tubes. The CT-containing PVDF segments were washed five times with 1 ml of distilled water, incubated for 30 min at 37°C with 1 ml of 0.5% polyvinylpyrrolidone-360 in 100 mM acetic acid (to prevent adsorption of trypsin to the PVDF during digestion), washed 10 times with 1 ml of distilled water, and finally washed five times with 1 ml of 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate containing 5% acetonitrile (buffer E). The PVDF segments were then incubated for 36 h at 37°C with 40 μg modified trypsin/ml, which was prepared fresh in buffer E; 20 μg of fresh modified trypsin was added after 12 h. The segments were then washed three times with 100 μl of buffer E. The digest was evaporated to dryness, dissolved in 400 μl of distilled water, and evaporated again. The dried sample was dissolved in 10 μl of electrophoresis buffer and applied to a 20 × 20-cm cellulose-coated plastic sheet. Phosphopeptides were separated in the first dimension by electrophoresis in 10% acetic acid, 1% pyridine, pH 3.5, for 1 h at 500 V, followed by thin layer chromatography in water/n-butanol/acetic acid/pyridine (24:20:6:30, v/v). The labeled peptides were visualized by autoradiography. Soluble and membrane fractions, prepared by the digitonin method, were incubated for 30 min at 37°C with buffer F (50 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 1 mM MnCl2, 0.23 M sucrose, 0.73 mg digitonin/ml, 2 mM dithiothreitol, 0.9 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.9 μg leupeptin/ml, and 0.9 μg pepstatin/ml) containing 400 units of λ phage protein phosphatase/ml, according to the procedure of Wang et al.(34.Wang Y. MacDonald J.I.S. Kent C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5512-5518Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Control incubations were with buffer F alone. Cellular free cholesterol mass measurements and filipin staining of intracellular free cholesterol were carried out exactly as described previously (39.Tabas I. Zha X. Beatini N. Myers J.N. Maxfield F.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22547-22556Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Unless otherwise indicated, results are given as means ± S.D. (n = 3); absent error bars in these figures signify S.D. values smaller than the graphic symbols. We first sought to determine if the mechanisms used by macrophages to activate CT in response to FC loading were present in CHO cells, since much is known about CT activation in this cell type(19.Kent C. Prog. Lipid Res. 1991; 29: 87-105Crossref Google Scholar). We utilized the CHO-mSRAII line, which is stably transfected with the murine macrophage scavenger receptor(29.Ashkenas J. Penman M. Vasile E. Acton S. Freeman M. Krieger M. J. Lipid Res. 1993; 34: 983-1000Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), so that we could load the cells with FC to a similar degree as macrophages. In fact, when these cells were incubated with acetyl-LDL plus the ACAT inhibitor, compound 58035, their FC content increased approximately 2-fold (see legend to Fig. 1), and their absolute level of FC was similar to that of macrophages incubated under similar conditions (Fig. 1C). Nonetheless, incorporation of labeled choline into PC, as a measure of phosphatidylcholine biosynthesis, 2Although the incorporation of labeled choline into PC can be affected by pool sizes of precursors, we have previously shown that cellular FC loading does not affect these pool sizes(17.Shiratori Y. Okwu A.K. Tabas I. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11337-11348Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, changes in the incorporation of labeled choline into PC should accurately reflect changes in PC biosynthesis. in FC-loaded CHO cells was not increased compared with that in unloaded CHO cells (Fig. 1A). The ~2-fold increment in FC in the CHO cells (see legend to Fig. 1) should have led to a ~2-fold increase in PC biosynthesis (cf. (17.Shiratori Y. Okwu A.K. Tabas I. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11337-11348Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)). In contrast, the macrophages showed ~3-fold increase in PC biosynthesis (Fig. 1B), as predicted by their ~3-fold increment in FC (cf. (17.Shiratori Y. Okwu A.K. Tabas I. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11337-11348Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)). In experiments not displayed here, we were able to reproduce the up-regulation of PC biosynthesis in CHO-mSRAII cells by phospholipase C treatment and show that this was associated with soluble-to-membrane CT translocation (cf. (40.Sleight R. Kent C. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 836-839Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)); note that soluble-to-membrane CT translocation has been shown not to be the mechanism of CT activation in FC-loaded macrophages(17.Shiratori Y. Okwu A.K. Tabas I. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11337-11348Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the cellular machinery responsible for the up-regulation of PC biosynthesis by cellular FC-loading in macrophages, mediated by the activation of CT(17.Shiratori Y. Okwu A.K. Tabas I. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11337-11348Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), is not shared by all cell types. The up-regulation of CT activity in FC-loaded macrophages does not depend upon new protein synthesis, is not associated with an increased level of CT mRNA, and, as mentioned above, does not involve soluble-to-membrane translocation(17.Shiratori Y. Okwu A.K. Tabas I. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11337-11348Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, we considered two general mechanisms of CT activation in these cells: direct activation of CT by FC, for example by an allosteric mechanism or by affecting the lipid microenvironment of the enzyme (cf.(41.Cornell R.B. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 5881-5888Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) and (42.Cheng D. Chang C.C.Y. Qu X. Chang T.-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 685-695Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar)), and alteration in the CT molecule by a FC-mediated signaling event, such as"
https://openalex.org/W2079980709,"The cause and consequence of altered proteoglycans in atherosclerosis are poorly understood. To determine whether proteoglycans affect monocyte binding, we studied the effects of heparin and proteoglycan degrading enzymes on THP-1 monocyte adhesion to subendothelial matrix (SEM). Monocyte binding increased about 2-fold after SEM was treated with heparinase. In addition, heparin decreased monocyte binding to fibronectin, a known SEM protein, by 60%. These data suggest that SEM heparan sulfate inhibits monocyte binding to SEM proteins. We next examined whether lysolecithin, a constituent of modified lipoproteins, affects endothelial heparan sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG) production and monocyte binding. Lysolecithin (10-200 μM) decreased total 35SO4 in SEM (20-75%). 2-fold more monocytes bound to SEM from lysolecithin treated cells than to control SEM. Heparinase treatment did not further increase monocyte binding to lysolecithin-treated SEM. HSPG degrading activity was found in medium from lysolecithin-treated but not control cells. 35SO4-labeled products obtained from labeled matrix treated with lysolecithin-conditioned medium were similar in size to those generated by heparinase. These data suggest that lysolecithin-treated endothelial cells secrete a heparanase-like activity. We hypothesize that decreased vessel wall HSPG, as occurs in atherogenic conditions, allows increased monocyte retention within the vessel and is due to the actions of an endothelial heparanase.

We hypothesize that decreased vessel wall HSPG, as occurs in atherogenic conditions, allows increased monocyte retention within the vessel and is due to the actions of an endothelial heparanase. One characteristic of the atherosclerotic lesion is the presence of lipid-rich macrophages termed foam cells. Many of these cells are descendants of blood monocytes that have accumulated within the subendothelial space and, in this location, have ingested lipoprotein lipid(1.Ross R. Nature. 1993; 362: 801-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (9823) Google Scholar). In animal models, elevated amounts of circulating lipoproteins can lead to migration of monocytes into the vessel wall (2.Joris I. Zand T. Nunnary J.L. Krolikowsky F.J Majno G. Am. J. Pathol. 1983; 113: 341-358PubMed Google Scholar, 3.Rosenfeld M.E. Tsukada T. Gown A.M. Ross R. Arteriosclerosis. 1987; 7: 9-23Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).

Monocytes are attracted by chemotactic signals released during the initial stages of atherogenesis(4.Cushing S.D. Berliner J.A. Valente A.J. Territo M.C. Navab M. Parhami F. Gerrity R. Schwartz C.J.

In vitro studies have identified three molecules, intracellular adhesion molecule 1 (CD 54), E-selectin (endothelial-leukocyte adhesion molecule-1), and vascular cell adhesion molecule, that are inducible on the endothelial surface and mediate monocyte binding(5.Bevilacqua M.P.

After monocytes bind to endothelium, they migrate through intercellular junctions and come in contact with SEM. They are then retained within the vessel wall and, in this location, are thought to acquire large amounts of lipid via their uptake of oxidatively modified lipoproteins(1.Ross R.

Within the vessel wall, monocytes may adhere to SEM adhesion proteins including collagen, fibronectin (FN), laminin, and vitronectin(8.Sage H. Pritzl P. Bornstein P. Arteriosclerosis. 1981; 1: 427-442Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These proteins contain domains (such as Arg-Gly-Asp) that can interact with monocyte cell surface integrins(9.Wright S.D. Meyer B.C. J. Exp. Med. 1985; 162: 762-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Among these protein-protein interactions, the ones between monocyte VLA-4 and FN and between monocyte MAC-1 and fibrinogen have been postulated to be of particular importance(10.Charo I.F. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1992; 3: 335-343Crossref Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Apart from the adhesion proteins, a significant proportion of the SEM is composed of proteoglycans (PG), negatively charged polysaccharides that play an important role in several cellular processes(11.Wight T.N. Arteriosclerosis. 1989; 9: 1-20Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12.Kinsella M.G. Wight T.N. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 2136-2144Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 13.Ruoslahti E. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13369-13372Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Each proteoglycan molecule contains glycosaminoglycan (GAG) carbohydrate chains and a core protein. Although SEM PG contain three classes of GAG (heparan sulfate, chondroitin sulfate, and dermatan sulfate), heparan sulfate is by far the most abundant, and HSPG accounts for about 80% of SEM PG produced by cultured EC(14.Timpl, R. (1994) EXS (Vol. Proteoglycans, Editor P. Jolles), p. 123-144Google Scholar). Three species of HSPG were identified in cultured bovine aortic EC, one of which, perlecan, has a core protein size of 400 kDa and is associated with basement membrane(15.Saku T. Furthmayr H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 3514-3523Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The composition and content of vessel wall PG change during development of the atherosclerotic lesion(16.Hoff H.F.

Arterial wall dermatan sulfate and chondroitin sulfate content increase during atherogenesis; dermatan sulfate and chondroitin sulfate have been postulated to retain LDL within the vessel wall(21.Srinivasan S.R. Vijayagopal P. Eberle K. Radhakrishnamurthy B. Berenson G.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 1006: 159-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In contrast, there is a decrease in HSPG in atherosclerotic vessels(19.Marten M. Kruse R. Buddecke E. Am. Heart Assoc. (Abst). 1994; 56Google Scholar, 20.Richardson M. Ihnatowycz I. Moore S. Lab. Invest. 1980; 43: 509-516PubMed Google Scholar). The significance of this decrease in HSPG has not been addressed. The present investigation was undertaken to understand the significance and the biochemical mechanisms of these alterations in SEM PG. The specific questions we asked were whether a decrease in HSPG facilitates monocyte binding to SEM and whether the HSPG levels are altered when EC are exposed to lipoproteins and atherogenic lipids such as lysolecithin. Lysolecithin is a component of atherogenic lipoproteins such as oxidized LDL and β migrating very low density lipoproteins and has been postulated to be an important causal agent of atherosclerosis(22.Quinn M.T. Parthasarathy S. Steinberg D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 2805-2809Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar). Our results provide initial evidence that SEM HSPG play an important role in preventing monocyte binding to SEM and that their levels are altered in response to specific stimuli. Furthermore, we show that decreases in SEM HSPG with lysolecithin are associated with the production of a heparanase-like activity by EC. L-α-Lysophosphatidylcholine (lysolecithin, cat. no. L 1381) from bovine brain was purchased from Sigma. L-[4,5-3H]Leucine (147 Ci/mmol) and [35S]sulfate aqueous solutions were obtained from Amersham Corp. Heparinase and heparitinase were purchased from either Sigma or Sekagaku America Inc. (Bethesda, MD). Chondroitin ABC lyase was from Sekagaku America Inc. 1 unit will form 0.1 μmol of unsaturated uronic acid/h. THP-1 cells were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD) and grown in RPMI 1640 medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Gemini Bioproducts Inc., Calabasas, CA). Bovine aortic EC were isolated and cultured as described(23.Sivaram P. Klein M.G. Goldberg I.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16517-16522Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The cells (10-15 passages) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Life Technologies, Inc.). Confluent EC monolayers were grown in 24- or 48-well culture dishes (Falcon, Becton Dickinson, Lincoln Park, NJ). SEM was prepared as described previously(24.Stins M.F. Maxfield F.R. Goldberg I.J. Arteriosclerosis. 1992; 12: 1437-1446Crossref Google Scholar). EC monolayers were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline and incubated for 5 min in a solution containing 20 mM NH4OH and 0.1% Triton X-100 at room temperature. Detached cells were removed by washing three times with phosphate-buffered saline followed by three times with DMEM containing 3% bovine serum albumin (DMEM-BSA). Monocytes were incubated with DMEM-BSA lacking leucine for 30 min prior to labeling. Approximately 100 μCi of [3H]leucine was added to 1 × 107 cells and incubated for another 2 h under cell culture conditions. Labeled cells were centrifuged at 800 rpm for 5 min to remove the label. The cells were then washed four times with DMEM-BSA and suspended in DMEM-BSA. Suspended cells were then added to either monolayers of EC or SEM in 48-well plates (2-4 × 105 cells/well). Binding was continued for 1 h at 37°C. The spontaneous release of radioactivity under these conditions was about 5%. Unbound monocytes were removed by washing four times with DMEM-BSA, and bound radioactivity was extracted by incubating in 0.1 N NaOH containing 0.1% SDS for 30 min at 37°C and counted. The number of monocytes bound to endothelial monolayer (approximately 30% of cells added) was about 2-3-fold more than that bound to SEM. In some experiments monocyte binding was carried out in DMEM containing 10% calf serum. For enzyme treatments, EC monolayers or SEM were incubated for 1 h at 37°C with different concentrations of heparinase/heparitinase or chondroitinase and washed, and then monocytes were added. To test the effect of lysolecithin, EC were incubated with 50 μM lysolecithin (from a 10 mM stock solution in 100% ethanol) for 16 h under cell culture conditions. Control cells received an equal amount of ethanol. SEM was prepared from control and lysolecithin-treated cells as described above. EC were labeled with [35S]sulfate for 24-48 h to label cellular PG. Cell-associated PG were assessed by removing cells with NH4OH/Triton X-100 as described above. SEM PG were extracted either by incubation with 0.1 N NaOH/SDS or with 6 M guanidine hydrochloride for 4 h. Alternatively, SEM was incubated with heparinase/heparitinase, and released radioactivity was measured to assess heparan sulfate. Total EC proteins were labeled by incubating cells with [3H]leucine for 2 h at 37°C. Unincorporated amino acid was removed, and total protein synthesis was assessed either by extraction of cells with NaOH/SDS or by precipitation with 10% trichloroacetic acid. Confluent monolayers of EC in T-175 culture flasks were incubated for 16 h in DMEM with 10% FBS with or without 50 μM lysolecithin. Subsequently, ECCM was collected and filtered. EC monolayers and SEM in 48-well culture plates were labeled with [3H]leucine or 35SO4. Labeled cells and SEM were incubated with ECCM prepared from control and lysolecithin-treated cells for 4 h at 37°C, and released label was counted. For size fractionation experiments 35SO4 labeled matrix in 6-well plates were incubated with guanidine hydrochloride, heparinase/heparitinase, trypsin (0.25 mg/ml), proteinase K (2 mg/ml), or lyso-ECCM for 4 h at 37°C. Released 35SO4 products were size fractionated either by centrifuging through a Centricon-100 (molecular weight cut-off, 100,000) or Centricon-30 (molecular weight cut-off, 30,000) (Amicon) according to Hoogewerf et al.(25.Hoogewerf A.J. Leone J.W. Reardon I.M. Howe W.J. Asa D. Heinrikson R.L. Ledbetter S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3268-3277Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Labeled material in the filtrate (bottom) and retentate (top) was measured by scintillation counting. To examine whether removal of HSPG from EC or from SEM affects monocyte binding, the number of monocytes binding to control and heparinase-treated EC and SEM was studied. Treatment of EC with 1 unit of heparinase did not significantly change the amount of THP-1 monocytes bound to EC (Fig. 1). In control experiments, heparinase at this concentration decreased 125I-lipase binding to EC by >60%(23.Sivaram P. Klein M.G. Goldberg I.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16517-16522Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In some experiments, a small, <20%, decrease in the number of monocytes adherent to EC was found with chondroitinase treatment. The effect of similar treatments on monocyte binding to SEM was then assessed. Treatment of SEM with 1 unit of heparinase increased the number of monocytes bound to SEM to 170% of control (Fig. 1). Chondroitinase treatment of SEM had no effect. Different concentrations of heparinase were then used to treat EC and SEM (Fig. 2). At 3 units/ml concentration, monocyte binding to SEM was increased by 2.2-fold, whereas monocyte binding to EC was not altered. These data suggest that HSPG in SEM inhibit monocyte binding to SEM and that their removal by heparinase increases monocyte binding. In separate experiments treatment of [3H]leucine-labeled SEM with heparinase did not lead to a release of radioactivity, suggesting the absence of proteases in the heparinase preparation (data not shown). Endothelial cells produce several matrix adhesion proteins that can potentially play a role in monocyte binding(8.Sage H. Pritzl P. Bornstein P. Arteriosclerosis. 1981; 1: 427-442Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These include collagen type IV, FN, laminin, and vitronectin, all of which contain domains that can bind to GAG. In the following experiment we used FN as a model SEM protein and examined whether the addition of a GAG such as heparin would affect monocyte adherence to FN. Plates were coated with FN (5 μg/ml), and monocyte binding to control plates and BSA- or FN-coated plates was assessed in the presence and the absence of 10 units/ml heparin. FN-coated plates bound 10-fold more monocytes than control or BSA-coated plates (Fig. 3). The number of monocytes bound to the FN-treated plates was decreased by >60% in presence of heparin. Binding to control and BSA-coated plates was not affected by heparin treatment. Furthermore heparin also inhibited monocyte binding to heparinase-treated SEM by approximately 50% (data not shown). These results suggest that one potential mechanism by which GAG can inhibit monocyte binding to matrix is by interacting with SEM adhesion proteins, e.g. as shown here fibronectin, and interfering with monocyte binding. Atherosclerotic vessels have altered proteoglycan levels (16.Hoff H.F. Wagner W.D. Atherosclerosis. 1986; 61: 231-236Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 17.Salisbury B.G. Hajjar D.P. Minick C.R. Exp. Mol. Pathol. 1985; 42: 306-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 18.Wagner W.D. Salisbury B.G. Lab. Invest. 1978; 39: 322-328PubMed Google Scholar, 19.Marten M. Kruse R. Buddecke E. Am. Heart Assoc. (Abst). 1994; 56Google Scholar) and some in vitro studies have shown that LDL affect cellular PG metabolism(26.Ehrlich K. Murray M. Experientia (Basel). 1978; 34: 179-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 27.Vijayagopal P. Srinivasa S.R. Dalferes E.R. Radhakrishnamurthy B. Berenson G.S. Biochem. J. 1988; 255: 639-646PubMed Google Scholar). We therefore tested whether LDL or lysolecithin, a component of modified lipoproteins, alters EC PG metabolism. PG production was assessed by growing cells in media containing [35S]sulfate. Incubation of EC with LDL (500 μg/ml) or lysolecithin (50 μM) had no significant effect on the amount of 35cell-associated PG (Fig. 4A). Similarly, LDL had no significant effect on the amount of SO4 incorporated into SEM PG. In contrast, lysolecithin decreased SEM PG by 55% (Fig. 4B); heparinase-releasable PG (HSPG) decreased by 60% (Fig. 4B, inset). These data demonstrate that lysolecithin primarily decreased the amount of HSPG. At 25-200 μM concentration, lysolecithin decreased SEM PG by 25-70% (Fig. 4C). Direct analysis by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiography of 35SO4-labeled SEM proteins revealed decreased 35SO4 incorporation into a large (>500 kDa) proteoglycan in lysolecithin-treated cells (Fig. 4D). To determine whether the lysolecithin altered cellular metabolism, e.g. by causing cell toxicity, total protein synthesis was assessed. [3H]Leucine incorporation into cellular proteins was not affected by lysolecithin treatment. Because lysolecithin decreased the amount of 35SO4 incorporated into SEM PG, we next tested whether lysolecithin treatment altered monocyte binding to SEM. Exposure of EC to lysolecithin (50 μM) increased monocyte adhesion to EC by approximately 2-fold, in agreement with published studies(28.Kume N. Cybulsky M.I. Gimbrone M.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 90: 1138-1144Crossref PubMed Scopus (713) Google Scholar). In addition, lysolecithin treatment increased the number of monocytes adhering to SEM by 1.8-fold (Fig. 5). Treatment of EC with LDL had no significant effect on the binding of monocytes either to EC (not shown) or SEM (Fig. 5). To examine whether the increased monocyte binding to SEM in lysolecithin-treated cells was due to a decrease in the SEM HSPG, we tested whether heparinase would increase monocyte adhesion to SEM from lysolecithin-treated cells. Heparinase (1 unit/ml) as expected increased monocyte adhesion to control SEM by 65%. In lysolecithin-treated cells, however, no further increase was observed with heparinase treatment. These data suggest that the lysolecithin-induced decrease in HSPG resulted in increased monocyte binding, and, for this reason, the increase was not enhanced by heparinase treatment. Decreased SEM HSPG in lysolecithin-treated cells could result from either 1) degradation of HSPG by the secretion of a protease or a heparanase or 2) decreased synthesis of SEM HSPG. To determine if ECCM from lysolecithin-treated cells contain HSPG degrading activity, ECCM was prepared from control and lysolecithin-treated cells as described under “Experimental Procedures” and tested for its ability to release radioactivity from 35SO4- (labeled PG) or [3H]leucine-labeled (total proteins) SEM (Fig. 6). Compared with control ECCM, lyso-ECCM released >2-fold more 35S radioactivity from SEM. The addition of lysolecithin to control ECCM did not affect the 35SO4 release. The amount of 35S radioactivity released by lyso-ECCM in different experiments varied from 40-60% of the counts released by heparinase treatment (not shown). Lyso-ECCM did not increase the amount of [3H]leucine released. The addition of heparin (100 units/ml) to lyso-ECCM abolished the releasing activity. Similarly, addition of suramin, another heparanase inhibitor, also inhibited the lyso-ECCM activity (not shown). This suggested that the 35S release was due to heparanase-like activity and not due to the actions of a general protease. Further experiments were done to confirm the presence of heparanase activity in lyso-ECCM. Several investigators studied the effects of proteases on the large HSPG and showed that the heparan sulfate chains are asymmetrically attached to core protein and treatment with different proteases leads to association of [35S]GAG in fragments with molecular masses of 130-200 kDa(29.Ledbetter S.R. Fisher L.W. Hassel J.R. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 988-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 30.Paulsson M. Yurchenco P.D. Ruben G.C. Engel J. Timpl R. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 197: 297-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). To determine if lyso-ECCM contained a protease- or heparanase-like activity, SEM was incubated with lyso-ECCM, heparinase (2 unit/ml), trypsin (0.25 mg/ml), or proteinase K (0.5 mg/ml) for 4 h at 37°C. The released 35S radioactivity (degradation products) was analyzed by size fractionation (25.Hoogewerf A.J. Leone J.W. Reardon I.M. Howe W.J. Asa D. Heinrikson R.L. Ledbetter S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3268-3277Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) as described under “Experimental Procedures” (Fig. 7). About 90-95% of the total extractable PG were found to have molecular masses of >100 kDa and did not go through Centricon-100 (Fig. 7, GnHCl bar). Approximately 80-90% of the radioactivity released by either heparinase or lyso-ECCM passed through a Centricon-100 (molecular weight, <100,000). In contrast only 20-25% of trypsin and proteinase K released radioactivity was filtered. In addition, 45-50% of the heparinase or lyso-ECCM released radioactivity passed through a Centricon-30 membrane, indicating the presence of products with a molecular mass of <30 kDa. Thus, our data suggest that lysolecithin treatment of EC stimulates the secretion of a heparanase-like activity that in turn decreases SEM HSPG. The present studies were performed to understand the contribution of SEM HSPG to monocyte adhesion. Our data suggest that SEM HSPG function as a negative regulator of monocyte adhesion to SEM. Removal of SEM HSPG increased monocyte binding by approximately 2-fold. Several matrix proteins have been shown to bind to GAG. This led to the suggestion that cell surface PG play a role in cell-substrate binding (31.Culp L.A. Laterra J. Lark M.W. Beyth R.J. Tobey S.L. CIBA Found. Symp. 1986; 124: 158-178PubMed Google Scholar, 32.Hook M. Woods A. Johansson S. Kjellen L. Couchman J.R. CIBA Found. Symp. 1986; 124: 143-157PubMed Google Scholar, 33.Sanders S. Bernfield M. J.

Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 945-952Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Sanders and Bernfield (33.Sanders S. Bernfield M. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 423-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar) showed that mammary epithelial cells have at least two distinct cell surface receptors for FN. These cells have a trypsin-resistant molecule that binds to Arg-Gly-Asp sequences and a trypsin labile HSPG that binds to the carboxyl-terminal heparin-binding domain of FN. Other studies have suggested that cell adhesion through PG may be an auxiliary mechanism that complements a more specific integrin-mediated adhesion(35.Ruoslahti E. Pierschbacher M.D. Science. 1987; 238: 491-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (3774) Google Scholar, 36.Hautanen A. Gailit J. Mann D. Ruoslahti E. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 1437-1442Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Several studies have also shown that GAG inhibit integrin-mediated cell binding to FN (35.Ruoslahti E. Pierschbacher M.D. Science. 1987; 238: 491-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (3774) Google Scholar) or to perlecan core protein itself(37.Hayashi K. Madri J.A. Yurchenco P.D. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 945-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Vessel wall contains several basement membrane adhesion proteins including collagen, FN, and laminin. Studies have shown that FN is made by aortic cells and rapidly incorporated into extracellular matrix (38.Takasaki I. Chobanian A.V. Brecher P. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17686-17694Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Immunohistochemical studies have also shown that FN is present throughout the vessel wall of normal and atherosclerotic vessels and have suggested that FN may promote monocyte chemotaxis and play a role in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis(39.Clark R.A.F. Wikner N.E. Doherty D.E. Norris D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 12115-12123Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 40.Smith E.B. Ashall C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 880: 10-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 41.Glukhova M.A. Frid M.G. Shekonin B.V. Vasilevskaya T. Grunwald J. Saginati M. Koteleansky V.E. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 357-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Hence in our studies we employed FN as a representative of SEM adhesion proteins and as a candidate for monocyte binding. Our results show that GAG inhibit monocyte binding to FN. This inhibition could be due to effects on monocyte integrin-mediated binding or monocyte surface HSPG-mediated binding, both of which are known to be inhibited by GAG. This may also be true for other adhesion proteins present in SEM, such as collagen and laminin, which also contain both GAG and integrin-binding domains. Thus, in the present studies SEM HSPG inhibition of monocyte binding may, in part, be due to HSPG GAG binding to some of these proteins thereby affecting monocyte binding. Lysolecithin has been implicated in several of the atherogenic effects of modified lipoproteins including induction of chemotaxis and expression of EC adhesion proteins(22.Quinn M.T. Parthasarathy S. Steinberg D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 2805-2809Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar, 28.Kume N. Cybulsky M.I. Gimbrone M.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 90: 1138-1144Crossref PubMed Scopus (713) Google Scholar). Our studies demonstrate another potentially atherogenic action of lysolecithin, increasing monocyte adhesion to SEM. The extent of the observed increase in monocytes adhering to SEM can be explained by the loss of HSPG alone, i.e. the increase in monocyte binding due to lysolecithin treatment was similar to that found after heparinase treatment of SEM from control cells, a 2-fold increase. Moreover, because heparinase treatment of SEM from lysolecithin-treated cells did not lead to a further increase in monocyte adherence, it is likely that the lysolecithin effect is entirely due to the reduction of SEM HSPG. Heparanase is produced by several mammalian cells including neutrophils, platelets, and tumor cells(42.Matzner Y. Vlodavsky I. Bar-Ner M. Ishai-Michaeli R. Tauber A.I. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1992; 51: 519-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 43.Oosta G.M. Favreau L.V. Beeler D.L. Rosenberg R.D. J. Biol.

Tumor cell heparanase has been implicated in tumor metastasis(45.Vlodavsky I. Korner G. Ishai-Machaeli R. Bashkin P. Bas-Shavit R. Fuks Z. Cancer Metastasis Rev. 1990; 9: 203-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Although EC have been postulated to produce heparanase like enzymes in situations such as wound healing and angiogenesis(46.Baird A. Ling N. Biophys. Biochem. Res. Commun. 1987; 142: 428-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar), such an activity has not been demonstrated. Matrix-degrading metalloproteases are found in atherosclerotic vessels and are synthesized by lesion macrophages(47.Galis Z.S. Sukhova G. Lark M.W. Libby P. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 94: 2493-2503Crossref PubMed Scopus (2146) Google Scholar, 48.Galis Z.S. Sukhova G. Kranzhofer R. Clark S. Libby P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 402-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar), and these enzymes are implicated in extracellular matrix remodeling during atherogenesis. Although such proteases could also alter proteoglycans(49.Woessner J.F. FASEB J. 1991; 5: 2145-2154Crossref PubMed Scopus (3040) Google Scholar), our data are most consistent with the production of a heparanase-like activity by lysolecithin-stimulated cells. The amount of sulfate-labeled proteins, predominantly PG, were decreased in the SEM but not in cells after lysolecithin treatment. This was associated with the presence in lyso-ECCM of an activity that released sulfate but not labeled amino acids from the SEM. Furthermore, this activity was inhibited by heparin, a known heparanase inhibitor, and the 35SO4 degradation products were similar to those released by heparinase. It should be noted that obtaining heparanase in active form in ECCM was not always possible. It is not clear whether the enzyme is rapidly inactivated in the medium or bound to PG and not easily released. The identity of the endothelial heparanase is not clear. Hoogewerf et al.(25.Hoogewerf A.J. Leone J.W. Reardon I.M. Howe W.J. Asa D. Heinrikson R.L. Ledbetter S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3268-3277Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) recently made a very interesting observation that platelet heparanases belong to the CXC chemokine family of peptides that include connective tissue-activating peptide-III and neutrophil-activating peptide-2. These peptides have molecular masses of 8-10 kDa and are different from the platelet heparanase previously characterized(43.Oosta G.M. Favreau L.V. Beeler D.L. Rosenberg R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 11249-11255Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These chemokine family of heparanases are also different from those produced by tumor cells(50.Nakajima M. Irimura T. Di Ferranta N. Nicolson G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 2283-2290Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although endothelial cells are not known to produce connective tissue-activating peptide-III and neutrophil activating peptide-2(51.Baggiolini M. Dewald B. Moser B. Adv. Immunol. 1994; 55: 97-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (2240) Google Scholar), it is possible that under specific stimulus (e.g. exposure to lysolecithin) endothelial cells may produce these chemokines. In our preliminary experiments using size fractionation of ECCM we were not able to detect the activity in the fraction with a molecular weight of <30,000 (not shown). Experiments to identify whether endothelial heparanase belong to the chemokine family are currently underway. Exposure of EC to LDL (500 μg/ml) for 24 h neither increased monocyte adhesion to SEM nor changed proteoglycan metabolism. In one previous study, incubation of EC with high concentrations of LDL for 48 h caused a 50% decrease in basement membrane HSPG(52.Olgemoller B. Schleicher E.D. Schwaabe S. Guretzki H.-J. Gerbitz K. FEBS Lett. 1990; 264: 37-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). It is, however, conceivable that the LDL underwent oxidation during the long course of incubation leading to the generation of products such as lysolecithin. How lysolecithin perturbs EC is unclear. It should be noted that the effects of lysolecithin in the present studies were observed in presence of serum containing media, suggesting that such effects are possible in vivo in the environment of the subendothelial intima. Recent studies have shown that alterations in endothelial function by lysolecithin are mediated by activation of protein kinase C (53.Kugiyama K. Ohgushi M. Sugiyama S. Murohara T. Fukunaga K. Miyamoto E. Yasue H. Circ. Res. 1992; 71: 1422-1428Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 54.Oishi K. Raynor R.L. Charp P.A. Kuo J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6865-6871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, lysolecithin has been shown to inhibit calcium influx in aortic EC(55.Inoue N. Hirata K. Yamada M. Hamamori Y. Matsuda Y. Akita H. Yokoyama M. Circ. Res. 1992; 71: 1410-1421Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). We are currently investigating whether similar mechanisms operate with respect to its actions on EC HSPG metabolism. In summary our studies provide evidence for a protective role for vessel wall HSPG, i.e. preventing monocyte retention in the intima. Based on our data we hypothesize that in normal intima the basement membrane proteins such as FN, laminin, and collagen are masked by HSPG present in SEM. This masking prevents the binding and retention of monocytes within the intima. Our data also suggest an additional atherogenic role for lysolecithin, i.e. to modulate subendothelial HSPG. Upon exposure to lysolecithin EC are “activated,” resulting in the secretion of SEM HSPG degrading (heparinase-like) activity. This, we postulate, decreases SEM HSPG and increases monocyte-SEM interaction. In vivo such an effect could increase retention of monocytes within the arterial wall, allowing them to convert into macrophage-rich foam cells. Removal of SEM HSPG, apart from facilitating monocyte retention, may have other atherogenic consequences. It may increase arterial permeability leading to further increase in lipoprotein movement and retention. SEM contains HSPG bound growth factors(56.Vlodavsky I. Folkman J. Sullivan R. Fridman R.

Cell. 1991; 64: 867-869Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1153) Google Scholar). When released, these factors stimulate smooth muscle cells to migrate and proliferate in the intima. Thus, our results for the first time demonstrate that endothelial cells produce a heparanase activity under specific stimulus, and we postulate that dysregulation of the endothelial heparanase could play an important role in the pathophysiology of atherosclerosis.

PPRE of the rat enoyl-CoA hydratase/3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase (HD) gene, which closely resembles the rat peroxisomal fatty acyl-CoA oxidase (ACOX) PPRE(11.Osumi T. Wen J.K. Hashimoto T.

Both the HD and ACOX PPREs can mediate the transactivation of chimeric genes by peroxisome proliferators(14.Zhang B. Marcus S.L. Miyata K.S. Subramani S. Capone J.P. Rachubinski R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12939-12945Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Unlike the ACOX PPRE, HD PPRE consists of three imperfect direct repeats of the consensus TGACCT motifs separated by 2 bp (DR2) and 1 bp (DR1), respectively(13.Zhang B. Marcus S.L. Sajjadi F.G. Alvares K. Reddy J.K. Subramani S. Rachubinski R.A. Capone J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7541-7545Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 14.Zhang B. Marcus S.L. Miyata K.S.

We demonstrate here that a TCTCCT hexamer located 1 bp upstream of the DR2 element is another imperfect TGACCT motif involved in the trans-activation process. This imperfect TGACCT motif, together with three previously identified TGACCT motifs, constitute a unified regulatory site (PPRE binding unit). Thus, the rat HD PPRE consists of two DR1 elements overlapping a DR2 element. Our results indicate that in this rat HD PPRE binding unit, one PPAR/RXR heterodimer recognizes a DR2 motif yielding C2 complex or two PPAR/RXR heterodimers recognize two individual DR1 elements giving rise to C1 complex, providing the peroxisome proliferator signaling pathway with two distinct responses. The coding sequences for rPPARα and rRXRα were amplified by polymerase chain reaction from the respective cDNAs with two sets of primers: 5′AAT GCG GCC GCT ATG CAT CAC CAT CAC CAT CAC ATG GTG GAC ACA GAG AGC CCC3′/5′TGC TCT AGA GCA ACG GCC TAC CAT CTC AGG3′, and 5′AAT GCG GCC GCT ATG CAT CAC CAT CAC CAT CAC ATG GAC ACC AAA CAT TTC CTG3′/5′ATT GTC TAG AGC AGC TGT GTC CAG GCG GGG3′, respectively. After sequencing, the amplified cDNAs were introduced into a pVL1392 transfer vector as NotI/XbaI fragments. Baculovirus recombinants were recovered by using the BaculoGold in vivo recombination system (Pharmingen). For transient transfection studies, the rPPARα and rRXRα cDNAs were subcloned from these baculovirus transfer vectors into the EcoRI and BglII sites of the pSG5 vector (Invitrogen). Complementary oligonucleotides, corresponding to the HD PPRE and mutant derivatives (Fig. 1), were chemically synthesized, annealed, and inserted into the BglII site of a pGL2 (Promega)-based basal reporter construct (pTKLuc) that contains thymidine kinase promoter driving luciferase cDNA. The resulting plasmids were sequenced and recombinants that contain a single copy of the respective element in the same orientation as the native rat HD gene were selected for transfection assay. rPPARα and rRXRα proteins were obtained by infecting insect Sf9 cells with recombinant baculoviruses and purified by a Ni2+-NTA agarose column (Qiagen) as described elsewhere(15.Chu, R., Madison, L. D., Lin, L., Kopp, P., Rao, M. S., Jameson, J. L., Keddy, J. K.(1995) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A., in pressGoogle Scholar). The purified proteins yielded a single band by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; they were diluted (~10 ng/μl) and stored at −70°C. In a standard protein/DNA binding reaction, 5 μl of 32P-labeled DNA probe (1 × 105 cpm) were incubated with 5 μl each of the purified rPPARα and rRXRα, and 10 μl (75 ng) of poly(dI-dC) in a total volume of 25 μl for 20 min at 20°C. The protein-DNA complexes were analyzed by electrophoresis through a 4% polyacrylamide gel using 0.5 × TBE (45 mM Tris borate, 1 mM EDTA). Transfections were carried out by the calcium phosphate procedure using 10-cm dishes of CV1 cells as described(16.Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Greene Publishing Associates & Wiley-Interscience, NY1993: 911-917Google Scholar). Transfections typically contained 1 μg of a reporter gene construct, 0.2 μg of rPPARα expression plasmid, 0.2 μg of rRXRα expression plasmid, and 0.5 μg of a bacterial β-galactosidase expression vector pCMVβ (Invitrogen) as an internal control. Cells were incubated in the presence of 0.5 mM ciprofibrate or 0.5% dimethyl sulfoxide, as required. Following a 40-h incubation, cells were processed to assess luciferase activity; the activity obtained for individual transfections was expressed relative to the β-galactosidase activity obtained for the same preparation of lysate(15.Chu, R., Madison, L. D., Lin, L., Kopp, P., Rao, M. S., Jameson, J. L., Keddy, J. K.(1995) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A., in pressGoogle Scholar). Rat HD PPRE has been shown to form two types of cell-specific protein-DNA complexes (C1 and C2) when incubated with nuclear extracts from H4IIEC3 cells(13.Zhang B. Marcus S.L. Sajjadi F.G. Alvares K. Reddy J.K. Subramani S. Rachubinski R.A. Capone J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7541-7545Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Incubation of a 36-bp probe (−2959 to −2924, Fig. 1b) with the purified rPPARα and rRXRα proteins revealed two bands corresponding to the C1 and C2 complexes (Fig. 2). When 9- and 7-bp sequences flanking the DR2 element were deleted from the 5′ and 3′ end, respectively, of the 36 bp probe, only one band was observed. In contrast, both the short (19 bp) and long (36 bp) probes of rat ACOX PPRE in the same region as the HD PPRE, exhibited a single band. It is of interest to note that the PPAR/RXR heterodimer (C2 complex) bound with the short and long probes of either HD PPRE or ACOX PPRE, respectively, displayed a different extent of migration; the reason for this difference is not clear at present. Nevertheless, the C2 complex formed on the HD PPRE was the same as the heterodimeric PPAR/RXR complex formed with the rat ACOX PPRE. The C1 complex formed only with the 36-bp HD PPRE probe thus appears to be sequence-specific. PPAR and RXR combine to form a heterodimer and bind to ACOX PPRE(8.Kliewer S.A. Umesono K. Noonan D.J. Heyman R.A. Evans R.M. Nature. 1992; 358: 771-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (1510) Google Scholar). The C2 complex formed on HD PPRE displayed similar mobilities as the heterodimer bound on the ACOX PPRE implying that it is also a PPAR/RXR heterodimer. The C1 complex displayed a slower extent of migration suggesting that it may contains more than two receptor molecules. To examine whether PPAR and RXR are equally presented in the C1 complex, gel mobility shift assays were done using different concentrations of protein and probe. Increasing RXR concentration and keeping PPAR constant resulted in a cooperative increase in both the C1 and C2 complexes (Fig. 3A, lanes 1-3). Likewise, increasing PPAR concentration while keeping the amount of RXR constant also resulted in an increase of C1 and C2 complexes (Fig. 3A, lanes 4-6). These results indicate that, as with the C2 complex, the C1 complex also consists of an equal molar amount of PPAR and RXR. Saturation of the probes with receptor proteins showed almost no effect on the C1:C2 ratio (Fig. 3B), indicating that the C1 and C2 complexes are independently formed and the heterodimeric C2 complex cannot convert to the multimeric C1 complex. The C1 complex is sequence-specific and is composed of equal amounts of PPAR and RXR. The formation of C1 complex is due to the special structure of HD PPRE. By comparing the nucleotide sequence of rat HD and ACOX PPRE, we anticipated that a TCTCCT hexamer, which is similar to the consensus TGACCT motif and linked by a T nucleotide to the previously identified first TGACCT motif, can potentially serve as a binding site in HD PPRE (Fig. 1b). If it is the case, this hexamer, together with three other imperfect TGACCT motifs previously identified, can form two DR1 elements (Fig. 1, e and f; designated as DR1L and DR1R, respectively) overlapping the original DR2 element. Gel mobility shift assays indicated that the DR1L, DR1R, as well as, DR2 element, can individually bind with PPAR and RXR heterodimers (Fig. 4A). Mutation of any one of the TGACCT motif, as expected, formed no C1 complex when compared to the wild type probe (Fig. 4B). The second TGACCT motif seems to be the most critical one, as mutation of this motif also significantly reduced the formation of the heterodimeric C2 complex (Fig. 4B, lane 3). A very small amount (about 1/20 of the wild type) of C1 complexes remained when the last TGACCT motif was altered (Fig. 4B, lane 5) suggesting that these four TGACCT motifs are unified, and each of these TGACCT motifs contributes differently. These results suggest that with a special structure, the rat HD PPRE can alternatively bind with two PPAR/RXR heterodimers to form the C1 complex, or with one PPAR/RXR heterodimer to form the C2 complex. It has been reported that a single copy of rat HD PPRE is more efficient in activating the reporter gene than an equivalent length of ACOX PPRE in the peroxisome proliferator-responsive H4IIEC3 cells(14.Zhang B. Marcus S.L. Miyata K.S. Subramani S. Capone J.P. Rachubinski R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12939-12945Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Transfection of CV1 cells with the reporter constructs together with rPPARα and rRXRα expression plasmids confirmed the results obtained from H4IIEC3 cells (Fig. 5). In correlating with the gel shift results, mutation of any one of the four TGACCT motifs significantly reduced the transcriptional response to ciprofibrate. The M2 and M3 mutants which altered the second and third TGACCT motifs, respectively, abolished the response to ciprofibrate almost totally. Whereas the M1 and M4 mutants which can still bind with one PPAR/RXR heterodimer displayed marginal activities. Although, the individual DR1 and DR2 elements can bind efficiently with the PPAR/RXR heterodimer, they are not sufficient to activate the reporter gene in response to a peroxisome proliferator. The lack of responses of those individual DR1 and DR2 elements to the inducer may be due to the requirement of additional flanking sequences. Palmer et al.(17.Palmer C.N.A. Hsu M.-H. Griffin K.J. Johnson E.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16114-16121Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar) reported that in rabbit cytochrome P-450 4A6 PPRE (which exhibits two imperfect AGGTCA motifs), six nucleotides 5′ of the DR1 element appear necessary for both receptor binding and reporter gene activation. The oligonucleotides used in our study disrupt this extended binding site as it is replaced with BglII overhangs used for cloning. PPREs have been identified in various genes with variations in the binding site and spacer sequence(1.Reddy J.K. Mannaerts G.P. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1994; 14: 343-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar, 10.Green S. Wahli W. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1993; 100: 149-153Crossref Scopus (157) Google Scholar). We now show that the rat HD PPRE is the first PPRE identified so far with four naturally occurring TGACCT half-sites. Four half-sites have also been found in the cellular retinol-binding protein element (CRBP-II element) which serves as an efficient RXR element and facilitates the formation of a homotetrameric complex on the CRBP-II element(18.Chen H. Privalsky M.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 422-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The homotetrameric complex on the CRBP-II element was formed only with RXR α and γ, but not with β, isoform(18.Chen H. Privalsky M.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 422-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). In our study, only the rPPARα and the rRXRα isoforms were tested to examine their ability to form heterooligomers with HD PPRE. Additional studies are needed to ascertain whether the C1 complex formed on the HD PPRE is also isoform-specific. In fact, PPARα plays a major role in the response to peroxisome proliferators(7.Lee S.S.-T. Pineau T. Drago J. Lee E.J. Owens J.W. Kroetz D.L. Fernadez-Salguero P.M. Westphal H. Gonzalez F.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3012-3022Crossref PubMed Scopus (1487) Google Scholar). The binding of four RXR molecules to the CRBP-II element is highly cooperative and interactive and occurs without the detectable formation of dimeric complexes(18.Chen H. Privalsky M.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 422-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). It is not clear whether the C1 complex formed on the HD PPRE simply represents either two noninteractive or two highly interactive PPAR/RXR heterodimers. Unlike the RXR homotetramer formed on the CRBP-II element, PPAR and RXR exhibit near equal amounts of C1 and C2 complexes on the HD PPRE. Furthermore, saturation of the probe cannot convert the heterodimeric C2 complex to the tetrameric C1 complex, suggesting that these two complexes are possibly formed by different mechanisms as proposed in Fig. 6. The C1 complex, composed of two PPAR/RXR heterodimers with minimal or no interaction, occupies the two DR1 motifs, conferring a highly efficient responsiveness to peroxisome proliferators. In contrast, the heterodimeric C2 complex forms only on the DR2 element conferring a low or non-responsiveness to peroxisome proliferators. Studies on the binding of RXR heterodimers with thyroid hormone receptor (on DR4 element) and RAR (on DR2 and DR5 elements) have shown that RXR occupies the 5′-half-site of AGGTCA direct repeats(19.Zechel C. Shen X.-Q. Chen J.-Y. Chen Z.-P. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1425-1433Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). The binding of RAR to the upstream half-site of DR1 elements results in switching of the RAR from an activator to an inhibitor(20.Kurokawa R. DiRenzo J. Beohm M. Sugarman J. Gloss B. Rosenfeld M.G. Heyman R.A. Glass C.K. Nature. 1994; 371: 528-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). In cytochrome P-450 4A6 PPRE, an extended 5′ sequence of two imperfect AGGTCA direct repeats is required for PPAR/RXR binding implying that PPARα occupies the 5′-half-site of the two AGGTCA motifs(17.Palmer C.N.A.

The AGGTCA motifs are presented on the lower strand of the HD PPRE relative to the promoter of HD gene. Thus, in rat HD PPRE, we propose that PPAR also occupies 5′ AGGTCA motif and RXR occupies 3′ AGGTCA motif, i.e. that RXR is in upstream and PPAR is in downstream relative to the promoter. The polarity of RXR and PPAR on the central DR2 is reversed in C1 complex. The failure of switching C2 to C1 complex is possibly due to the fact that the binding of a single heterodimer to the DR2 element to form C2 complex is in the same orientation as for the binding of the heterodimers to each of the DR1 elements in C1 complex and that it does not permit the binding of additional receptors to the outer sites in the favorable orientation. Thus, unlike the RXR homotetramer, RXR and PPAR form two distinct complexes on HD PPRE. We thank Dr. Frank Gonzalez for the gift of rat PPARα cDNA. We greatly appreciate the comments of Dr. J. Larry Jameson on the manuscript."
https://openalex.org/W1599193939,"Morphogenesis and tissue repair require appropriate cross-talk between the cells and their surrounding milieu, which includes extracellular components and soluble factors, e.g., cytokines and growth factors. The present work deals with this communication needed for recovery after axotomy in the central nervous system (CNS). The failure of CNS axons to regenerate after axonal injury has been attributed, in part, to astrocyte failure to repopulate the injury site. The goal of this work was to provide an in vitro model to mimic the in vivo response of astrocytes to nerve injury and to find ways to modulate this response and create a milieu that favors astrocyte migration and repopulation of the injury site. In an astrocyte scratch wound model, we blocked astrocyte migration by tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha). This effect could not be reversed by astrocyte migration-inducing factors such as transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-beta 1) or by any of the tested extracellular matrix (ECM) components (laminin and fibronectin) except for vitronectin (Vn). Vn, added together with TNF-alpha, counteracted the TNF-alpha blockage and allowed a massive migration of astrocytes (not due to cell proliferation) beyond that allowed by Vn only. Heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPG) were shown to be involved in the migration. The results may be relevant to regeneration of CNS axons, and may also provide an example that an extracellular component (Vn) can overcome and neutralize a negative effect of a growth factor/cytokine (TNF-alpha) and can act in synergy with other features of this cytokine to promote a necessary function (e.g., cell migration) that is otherwise inhibited."

We have synthesized a photolyzable derivative of PA, termed caged PA (cPA), which may be utilized as a new tool in studies of PA-mediated cellular events. 1-(2-Nitrophenyl)diazoethane, synthesized from 2-nitroacetophenone, was reacted with dipalmitoyl-PA to yield a 1-(2-nitrophenyl)ethyl ester of PA.

It is assumed that upon activation of PLD a signal is transmitted downstream via the rise in intracellular phosphatidic acid (PA).

Here we describe the synthesis and characterization of a photolyzable analogue of PA, termed caged PA (cPA), that allows the elevation of the intracellular level of PA upon ultraviolet irradiation. The utility of cPA as a probe was examined in HT 1080 metastatic fibrosarcoma cells. Metastatic spread depends upon the invasive capacity of tumor cells which, in turn, depends on their ability to secrete proteolytic enzymes, such as gelatinase A (MMP-2), that participate in degradation of the basement membrane(6.Liotta L.A.

Liscovitch M. Clin. Exp. Metastasis. 1995; 13: 134-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Laminin-induced release of MMP-2 was inhibited by 1-butanol, while addition of exogenous PA or of bacterial PLD into the growth medium mimicked the effect of laminin(12.Reich R. Blumenthal M. Liscovitch M. Clin. Exp. Metastasis. 1995; 13: 134-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Thus, HT 1080 cells represent a useful experimental system for studying the second messenger function of PA. We now show that cPA photolysis leads to a rise in intracellular PA and subsequently to secretion of MMP-2 in HT 1080 cells. All chemicals and solvents used were of reagent grade. Dipalmitoylphosphatidic acid (sodium salt), imidazole, and bovine serum albumin (BSA) were obtained from Sigma. Gelatin was a product of BDH. Hydrazine hydrate, CDCl3, and 2-nitroacetophenone were from Aldrich. MnO2 (activated grade), MgSO4, and Silica Gel 60 aluminum thin layer chromatography (TLC) plates were purchased from Merck. [32P]ATP and [14C]PA were obtained from DuPont NEN. Diacylglycerol kinase was purchased from Calbiochem. Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM), fetal calf serum (FCS), and supplemented antibiotics are products of Biological Industries, Kibbutz Beth HaEmek, Israel. HT 1080 cells derived from a metastatic lesion of human fibrosarcoma were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) and maintained in DMEM, 10% FCS supplemented with 1000 units/ml penicillin and 100 mg/ml streptomycin. The experiments were carried out with cells which have been serum-deprived by an overnight incubation in DMEM, 0.1% BSA. Before the experiment, the medium was replaced by DMEM without phenol red (DMEM-PR) containing 0.1% BSA to avoid quenching of ultraviolet light by the dye. Phosphatidic acid (sodium salt) was dissolved in chloroform to yield a final concentration of 14 mg/ml. Methanol and 0.2 N HCl were added (chloroform/methanol/HCl ratio of 1:1:0.9, v/v), and the mixture was mixed vigorously. Phase separation was accomplished by centrifugation for 10 min at 2000 rpm (Sorval HS-4) at room temperature. The lower phase containing the free acid form of PA was collected, and the pH was adjusted to 4-5 with 10% triethylamine in chloroform. The preparation of 1-(2-nitrophenyl)hydrazonoethane was carried out by dissolving 0.826 g (5 mmol) of 2-nitroacetophenone, 0.562 g (11.2 mmol) of hydrazine hydrate, and 0.32 ml (5 mmol) of glacial acetic acid in 10 ml of ethanol in a 20-ml reflux receptacle. The mixture was refluxed while stirring for 3 h and then was allowed to cool. The ethanol was evaporated in a 25-ml round-bottom flask using a rotary evaporator, and the residue was dissolved in 2 ml of chloroform. Traces of acetic acid were removed by washing the chloroform three times with 1 ml of H2O. Anhydrous MgSO4 (0.5 g) was added, and the mixture was left at room temperature for 5 min, then filtered through cotton, and stored at −20°C. For the synthesis of 1-(2-nitrophenyl)diazoethane, 1.35 ml of chloroform were stirred vigorously with 0.15 ml of 1-(2-nitrophenyl)hydrazonoethane together with 255 mg of MnO2. After 5 min, the mixture was filtered through cotton. This stage and all following stages were performed in subdued light. 1-(2-Nitrophenyl)diazoethane was freshly prepared before each synthesis of cPA and used immediately. The final stage in the preparation of 1-(2-nitrophenyl)ethyl ester of PA (namely cPA) was accomplished by stirring PA-free acid solution (10.35 μmol) together with the newly prepared 1-(2-nitrophenyl)diazoethane (155.25 μmol) for 45 min. Then the reaction mixture was applied to an aluminum TLC plate and developed with chloroform, methanol, 25% ammonium hydroxide (65:25:5, v/v). The band of 1-(2-nitrophenyl)ethyl ester of PA was localized by its fluorescence upon illumination of the edges of the plate at a wavelength of 254 nm. The band (Rf about 0.56) was scraped, and the cPA was extracted with methanol and quantitated by a phosphate assay as described before(13.Svanborg A. Svennerholm L. Acta Med. Scand. 1961; 169: 43-49Crossref Scopus (155) Google Scholar). PA labeled with 32P was prepared from diacylglycerol to which 32P was transferred from [γ-32P]ATP by diacylglycerol kinase as described previously(14.Preiss J. Loomis C.R. Bishop W.R. Stein R. Niedel J.E. Bell R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 8597-8600Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Mixing the 32P-labeled or 14C-labeled PA with PA dissolved in chloroform was followed by desalting as described above. [32P]cPA and [14C]cPA were prepared as detailed above for nonlabeled cPA. NMR spectra were obtained on a Bruker AMX 400 NMR spectrometer. The sample was dissolved in CDCl3 to a final concentration of 2 mg/ml. Peak assignment was aided by comparison of the precursors and the cPA. Data were analyzed on a Personal Iris Workstation (Silicon Graphics). cPA was solubilized by a 30-min sonication in a bath sonicator in DMEM-PR, 0.1% BSA. The solubilized cPA was introduced into the medium of overnight serum-deprived HT 1080 cells in a final concentration of 16 μM for 1 h, unless otherwise indicated. At the end of the incubation, excess cPA was removed by washing the cells twice with DMEM-PR, 0.1% BSA. Photolysis was carried out by illuminating the culture plates from a distance of 10 cm with two 15-watt mercury lamps (315 and 365 nm wavelength). Lipids were extracted from cultures of resting HT 1080 cells (5.Liscovitch M. Amsterdam A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 11762-11767Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and separated by two-dimensional TLC using chloroform/methanol/NH4OH (65:25:5) in the first dimension and chloroform/acetone/methanol/acetic acid/water (30:40:10:10:5) in the second dimension. Standard curves of PA were run in parallel. PA mass was determined by Coomassie Blue staining essentially according to Kaszkin et al.(19.Kaszkin M. Seidler L. Kast R. Kinzel V. Biochem. J. 1992; 287: 51-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). MMP-2 activity was determined as described previously(12.Reich R. Blumenthal M. Liscovitch M. Clin. Exp. Metastasis. 1995; 13: 134-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Results are expressed as the measured intensity relative to that of control. The synthesis of cPA is based on alkylation of the weakly ionized phosphate group of PA by 1-(2-nitrophenyl)diazoethane (Fig. 1A). In the first step, 1-(2-nitrophenyl)hydrazonoethane is synthesized from 2-nitroacetophenone by refluxing it with hydrazine hydrate in the presence of protons donated by glacial acetic acid. In the second step, 1-(2-nitrophenyl)hydrazonoethane is oxidized by MnO2 to yield 1-(2-nitrophenyl)diazoethane which later was allowed to react with PA resulting in the desired 1-(2-nitrophenyl)ethyl ester of PA. In general, the preparation of cPA is similar to the preparation of other caged compounds(15.Patton W.F. Alexander J.S. Dodge A.B. Patton R.J. Hechtman H.B. Shepro D. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 196: 31-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 16.Walker J. Reid G.P. McCray J.A. Trentham D.R. J. Am. Chem.

Nature. 1987; 327: 249-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). The main difference is in the last stage of the preparation which was accomplished in a single phase since here both reactants are hydrophobic and soluble in chloroform. As demonstrated in Fig. 1B, the 1-(2-nitrophenyl)ethyl moiety, which in cPA is linked to the phosphate group of the PA, is removable upon ultraviolet illumination at a wavelength of 300-400 nm. The expected structure of cPA and its photolytic products was verified by comparing the proton NMR spectra of cPA, PA, and photolyzed cPA (Fig. 2). The spectrum of cPA clearly shows the additional peaks contributed by the alkylating group (Fig. 2A). In particular, note the aromatic signals of the nitrophenyl group and the distinct appearance of the doublet at 1.7 ppm and the quartet at 3.0 ppm due to the coupled CH3-CH of the ethyl ester (JCH3-CH = 7.2 Hz). Those peaks disappeared upon ultraviolet irradiation, and the spectrum of the photolyzed cPA is nearly identical with that of PA (Fig. 2B). These results were confirmed by phosphorus NMR spectra showing that the single 31P signal of cPA which resonates at the chemical shift region of phosphodiesters, shifted following irradiation to the phosphomonoester region of the spectrum and overlapped with the phosphate signal of PA.2 The NMR results demonstrate also that the cPA preparation is devoid of contaminants such as PA and lyso-PA. Next we have measured the incorporation of cPA into HT 1080 cells by introducing [32P]cPA into the growth medium. The uptake of cPA was time-dependent, reaching a plateau after 120 min (Fig. 3A). In all additional experiments, loading was accomplished by incubating the cells with cPA for 1 h, after which uptake was 1327 pmol/5 × 105 cells, representing 8.3% of the cPA introduced into the medium. In vivo photolysis was demonstrated in [32P]cPA-loaded cells that were irradiated for various times (Fig. 3B). There was a direct relationship between the time of irradiation and [32P]PA accumulation. The results demonstrate that cPA is incorporated into the cells in a time-dependent manner. It is also shown that the increase in PA is correlated to the length of irradiation. The uptake of cPA was studied also in NIH 3T3 and Swiss 3T3 cells. These cells were found to be much more sensitive to an apparently cytotoxic effect of cPA at the concentrations used. 3B.-T. Williger, unpublished observations. MMP-2 is a key determinant of the metastatic potential of tumor cells. MMP-2 production in HT 1080 is stimulated by laminin(9.Terranova V.P. Hujanen E.S. Martin G.R. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1986; 77: 311-316PubMed Google Scholar, 10.Turpeeniemi-Hujanen T. Thorgeirsson U.P. Rao C.N. Liotta L.A. J. Biol.

Reprod. 1991; 45: 387-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). We have previously demonstrated that in HT 1080 cells laminin activates PLD (12.Reich R. Blumenthal M. Liscovitch M. Clin. Exp. Metastasis. 1995; 13: 134-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that the rise in PA level elicits MMP-2 release and that cPA photolysis would mimic this effect. The effect of cPA photolysis on MMP-2 release was compared to that of exogenously added PA (Fig. 4). cPA had no effect on MMP-2 release in nonilluminated cells (B) or in cells illuminated before its addition (A). Photolysis of cPA in cPA-loaded cells (C) caused a 2.1-fold increase in the activity of MMP-2 measured in the growth medium. In comparison, exogenous PA elevated MMP-2 release by 66% in illuminated cells. Incubation of HT 1080 cells with the by-product of cPA photolysis, 2-nitrosoacetophenone, had no effect on MMP-2 release, even when incubated with the cells for 3 h at very high concentrations (100 μM) (data not shown). It may thus be concluded that cPA photolysis mimics the effect of laminin in these cells by elevating the level of PA. The optimal duration of irradiation was tested by illuminating cPA-loaded cells for various times and measuring release of MMP-2 (Table 1). It is illustrated that short photolysis was more effective than long photolysis. As demonstrated earlier (Fig. 1B), efficient in vitro photolysis of cPA required irradiation longer than 60 s. However, exposing cells to ultraviolet irradiation for more than 20 s dramatically reduced their viability.3 On the other hand, as demonstrated here, a 5-s illumination was sufficient to photolyze enough cPA to mimic the effect of laminin on MMP-2 secretion. The reduction in the effectiveness of cPA photolysis on MMP-2 release, found with illumination periods longer than 5 s, might be explained by the greater damage caused to the cells by the ultraviolet light.3Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab To identify cellular processes that are directly modulated by PA, it is necessary to be able to experimentally cause very rapid changes in cellular PA concentrations. The introduction of caged PA derivatives into cultured cells is a novel approach that allows experimental elevation of intracellular PA. Light-induced generation of PA mimics signal-dependent activation of PLD, while physiological receptor, transducer, and effector mechanisms are bypassed. This approach offers the possibility of eliciting very rapid changes in membrane levels of PA in the absence of parallel, hormone-induced activation of other signaling pathways. In the present study it was demonstrated that cPA photolysis stimulates MMP-2 release whereas nonphotolyzed cPA had no effect, and that the effect of photolyzed cPA is about twice the effect of extracellularly added PA. The effect of cPA photolysis is likely due to the elevation of intracellular PA. Illumination for 5 s caused photolysis of 1.8% of the cPA (24 pmol/5 × 105 cells). The mass of PA in resting HT 1080 cells was determined by a two-dimensional TLC/Coomassie Blue staining procedure and found to be 31 pmol/5 × 105 cells. Therefore, it seems that even a relatively small elevation in PA mass is sufficient for eliciting a significant cellular response. In other studies it has been shown that agonist activation caused elevations of PA mass that were higher by approximately one order of magnitude(18.Cockcroft S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 795: 37-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 19.Kaszkin M. Seidler L. Kast R. Kinzel V. Biochem. J. 1992; 287: 51-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 20.Tou J.-S.

These greater elevations were obtained with a high concentration of agonists, representing a maximal or near-maximal activation of PLD and other pathways. However, it does not necessarily represent the physiological change needed for PA to exert its effect. Another possible explanation is that cPA photolysis forms microdomains of high PA concentration which are sufficient for causing its biological effects. The utilization of cPA offers a number of possibilities for studying the metabolism and action of PA in cells and cell-free preparations. Caged PA derivatives with either radioisotopically labeled or fluorescently labeled phosphatidyl moieties of different fatty acyl chain length could be employed to follow the uptake, transport, and metabolism of cPA and PA, before and after photolysis, respectively. This could provide hitherto unobtainable information regarding the metabolic fate of the PA produced by the signal-activated PLD. In addition, cPA photolysis could potentially be exploited to identify immediate biochemical responses that are directly regulated by PA, e.g. changes in activity of specific enzymes, protein phosphorylation patterns, or ionic currents. At present, the utility of cPA is somewhat limited by the low efficiency of the loading step. It may be expected (23.Rosenwald A.G. Pagano R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4577-4579Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24.Pagano R.E. Sleight R.G. Science. 1985; 229: 1051-1057Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar) that the exchange of cPA with cells (and hence the efficiency of its uptake) will be improved by using short chain analogs of cPA. Another factor that limits the usefulness of cPA is its apparent toxicity in some cell lines. The mechanism of this effect is not clear. Certain cell types are more sensitive to the “cage” moiety utilized in cPA(15.Patton W.F. Alexander J.S. Dodge A.B. Patton R.J. Hechtman H.B. Shepro D. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 196: 31-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 16.Walker J. Reid G.P. McCray J.A. Trentham D.R. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1988; 110: 7170-7177Crossref Scopus (329) Google Scholar). One way to overcome this problem will be to use photosensitive blocking groups other than the 1-(2-nitrophenyl)ethyl moiety that was employed here. We have previously shown that laminin stimulates PLD activity in HT 1080 cells(12.Reich R. Blumenthal M. Liscovitch M. Clin. Exp. Metastasis. 1995; 13: 134-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). A causal relationship between PLD activation and the subsequent laminin-induced release of MMP-2 was suggested by the fact that the effect of laminin was inhibited by 1-butanol, an alternative substrate of PLD that attenuates PA production by shunting phosphatidyl moieties from PA into phosphatidylbutanol. Furthermore, laminin-induced release of MMP-2 could be mimicked by treatment of the cells with an exogenous (bacterial) PLD. In the present study it is shown that light-induced generation of PA by photolysis of cPA also can mimic the action of laminin on MMP-2. Collectively, these data strongly suggest a pivotal role for PLD and PA in the signaling cascade of laminin-induced MMP-2 release and, consequently, in tumor cell invasiveness and metastasis. The photolysis of cPA is likely to be useful in elucidating the downstream biochemical events that follow PLD activation in these cells, causing changes in gene expression and culminating in malignant dissemination."
https://openalex.org/W1496031733,"We have shown previously that the 100-residue-long periplasmic N-terminal tail of the Escherichia coli inner membrane protein ProW can be translocated across the inner membrane in a sec-independent manner and that its translocation is blocked by the introduction of three positively charged residues near its C-terminal end (Whitley, P., Zander, T., Ehrmann, M., Haardt, M., Bremer, E., and von Heijne, G.(1994) EMBO J. 13, 4653-4661). We have now further analyzed the requirements for translocation of the N-terminal tail and found that the introduction of even a single arginine can block translocation. Position-specific differences in the effects on translocation of arginine insertions suggest that the C-terminal end of the N-terminal tail is more critical for translocation than the central and N-terminal regions. We also show that the N-terminal tail is translocated in a truncation mutant where a stop codon is placed immediately after the first transmembrane segment, provided that the transmembrane segment is flanked on its C-terminal end by positively charged residues. Thus, sec-independent translocation of a relatively large domain can be induced by a translocation signal located at the extreme C terminus of a protein. We have shown previously that the 100-residue-long periplasmic N-terminal tail of the Escherichia coli inner membrane protein ProW can be translocated across the inner membrane in a sec-independent manner and that its translocation is blocked by the introduction of three positively charged residues near its C-terminal end (Whitley, P., Zander, T., Ehrmann, M., Haardt, M., Bremer, E., and von Heijne, G.(1994) EMBO J. 13, 4653-4661). We have now further analyzed the requirements for translocation of the N-terminal tail and found that the introduction of even a single arginine can block translocation. Position-specific differences in the effects on translocation of arginine insertions suggest that the C-terminal end of the N-terminal tail is more critical for translocation than the central and N-terminal regions.

Thus, sec-independent translocation of a relatively large domain can be induced by a translocation signal located at the extreme C terminus of a protein. The insertion of proteins into the inner membrane of Escherichia coli has been studied intensely over the past few years, and it is now generally accepted that hydrophobic segments drive insertion and end up spanning the membrane, whereas the orientation of the transmembrane segments is controlled by flanking positively charged residues: the “positive inside” rule(1.von Heijne G. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1994; 23: 167-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). The details of the insertion mechanism are less clearly understood, however. In general, it seems that long periplasmic segments are translocated across the inner membrane by the so-called sec machinery also used by secretory proteins, whereas short periplasmic segments in most cases do not seem to require a fully functional sec machinery for translocation(2.von Heijne G. FEBS Lett. 1994; 346: 69-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). We recently described an interesting exception to this correlation between the length of a translocated domain and its sec-dependence; the 100-residue-long periplasmic N-terminal tail (N-tail) 1The abbreviations used are: N-taiN-terminal tailCCCPcarbonyl cyanide p-chlorophenylhydrazone. of the ProW protein can be efficiently translocated across the inner membrane under conditions where the function of SecB, SecA, or SecY is severely compromised(3.Whitley P. Zander T. Ehrmann M. Haardt M. Bremer E. von Heijne G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4653-4661Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Insertion of three positively charged arginines near the C-terminal end of the ProW N-tail blocks its sec-independent translocation, whereas insertion of three negatively charged aspartic acid residues has no effect. Dissipation of the electrochemical potential across the inner membrane also blocks translocation of the N-tail, suggesting an electrophoretic component in the translocation mechanism. N-terminal tail carbonyl cyanide p-chlorophenylhydrazone. We now report that insertion of a single arginine residue near the C-terminal end of the N-tail severely affects translocation, whereas insertion of two arginines blocks translocation almost completely irrespective of position. Further, we show that all of the ProW protein downstream of the most N-terminal transmembrane segment can be deleted with little effect on N-tail translocation, provided that a few positively charged residues are placed at the C-terminal end of the remaining transmembrane segment. To our knowledge, this is the first instance where the translocation of a large polar domain across the inner membrane has been shown to be induced by a translocation signal located at the extreme C terminus of the protein. Chicken egg white lysozyme, CCCP, and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride were from Sigma. Proteinase K was from Boehringer Mannheim. Enzymes used for DNA manipulation and sequencing were from Promega and Pharmacia. [35S]Methionine was from Amersham Corp. All experiments were performed in E. coli strain MC1061 (ΔlacX74, araD139, Δ(ara, leu)7697, galU, galK, hsr, hsm, strA). All constructs were expressed from the pING1 plasmid (4.Johnston S. Lee J.H. Ray D.S. Gene (Amst.). 1985; 34: 137-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) by induction with arabinose. Site-specific mutagenesis was performed according to the method of Kunkel (5.Kunkel T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 488-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (4880) Google Scholar) as modified by Geisselsoder et al.(6.Geisselsoder J. Witney F. Yuckenberg P. BioTechniques. 1987; 5: 786-791Google Scholar). All mutants were confirmed by DNA sequencing of single-stranded M13 DNA using T7 DNA polymerase. Cloning into the pING1 plasmid was performed as described(7.Dalbey R.E. Wickner W. Science. 1987; 235: 783-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The ProW-Lep(P2) fusion was constructed by polymerase chain reaction amplification of the chromosomal proW gene using an upstream primer containing a XhoI site for cloning situated before the first codon of the proW ORF and a downstream primer containing a KpnI site at the fusion joint. The polymerase chain reaction fragment was cloned using the XhoI and KpnI sites into an arabinose inducible vector (based on pING1) containing a mutant lep gene with a XhoI site immediately 5′ to the initiator codon and a KpnI site in codon 81 to create in-frame fusion with amino acid 81 of Lep. The fusion joint of the ProW182-Lep(P2) fusion protein was: IRP182VPY81EP (residues introduced by the cloning procedure are underlined; the numbers refer to the wild type ProW and Lep sequences). The same common polymerase chain reaction primer containing a XhoI site and the first codons of the proW ORF as used for the ProW-Lep(P2) fusions, and a second downstream primer was used for polymerase chain reaction amplification of the ProW1-119 fragment. The second primer contained either four codons downstream of proW codon 119 coding for amino acids MKKK followed by two stop codons and a KpnI site or two codons coding for amino acids MM followed by two stop codons and a KpnI site. The amplified fragments were cloned between the XhoI and KpnI sites in the pING1 vector containing ProW1-182-Lep(P2). E. coli strain MC1061 transformed with the pING1 vector carrying the different proW-lep constructs under control of the arabinose promoter were grown at 37°C in M9 minimal medium supplemented with 100 μg/ml ampicillin, 0.5% fructose, and all amino acids (50 μg/ml each) except methionine. Overnight cultures were diluted 1:25 in 1 ml fresh medium, shaken for 3.5 h at 37°C, induced with arabinose (0.2%) for 5 min, and labeled with [35S]methionine (150 μCi/ml). After 1 min, nonradioactive methionine was added (500 μg/ml), and incubation was stopped by chilling on ice. Cells were spun at 14,000 rpm for 2 min, resuspended in ice-cold buffer (40% w/v sucrose, 33 mM Tris, pH 8.0), and incubated with lysozyme (5 μg/ml) and 1 mM EDTA for 15 min on ice. Spheroplasts were then incubated with either 0.3 mg/ml proteinase K or with 0.33 mg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride for 1 h on ice. After the addition of phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride to the proteinase K-treated sample at the end of the incubation, samples were acid-precipitated (trichloroacetic acid, 10% final concentration), resuspended in 10 mM Tris, pH 7.5/2% SDS, immunoprecipitated with antisera to Lep (ProW1-182-Lep(P2) fusions) or ProW (ProW1-119 mutants), as well as OmpA (an outer membrane control) and AraB (a cytoplasmic control), washed, and analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and fluorography. For all samples, the fraction of background-corrected intensities in the protease-protected fragment band b (protease-treated cells; Fig. 1B, arrow) relative to bands a and b (where band a is the full-length protein in the protease-treated sample) was calculated. f=IbIa+Ib(Eq. 1) All quantitations were carried out on a Fuji BAS 1000 Image reader using the MacBAS (2.1) software. For the experiments reported in Fig. 4, the translocation efficiency was determined by normalizing the intensity in the ProW band by the intensity in the band corresponding to the cytoplasmic control AraB and then comparing the amount of ProW immunoprecipitated from samples either treated with proteinase K or left untreated. The degree of SecA-dependence was determined as follows. Constructs were induced with arabinose as above, and sodium azide was added (final concentration, 2 mM) 4 min after induction. 1 min later, [35S]methionine was added, and after an additional 1-min incubation, cells were put on ice, converted to spheroplasts, protease-treated, immunoprecipitated, and analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis as above. In parallel samples, azide-treatment was omitted. To test the dependence on the electrochemical membrane potential, cells were treated as in a normal protease protection experiment except that CCCP was added to a final concentration of 50 μM 45 s before the addition of [35S]methionine(8.Andersson H. von Heijne G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2267-2272Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 9.Daniels C.J. Bole D.G. Quay S.C. Oxender D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 5396-5400Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The wild type ProW protein has seven transmembrane segments, Fig. 1A. In order to facilitate the topological analysis of ProW mutants, we previously constructed a fusion between the N-terminal half of ProW (residues 1-182) and the C-terminal, normally periplasmic P2-domain (residues 81-323) of the E. coli inner membrane protein Lep(3.Whitley P. Zander T. Ehrmann M. Haardt M. Bremer E. von Heijne G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4653-4661Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The topologies of ProW and the ProW1-182-Lep(P2) fusion proteins are shown in Fig. 1A. In the fusion protein, the Lep domain is located in the cytoplasm, and translocation of the ProW N-tail to the periplasmic side of the inner membrane can be detected by protease treatment of spheroplasts, which will remove the ProW N-tail but leave the Lep domain intact. Somewhat atypically, the first cytoplasmic loop in ProW does not contain any positively charged residues, and we reasoned that some of the N-tail mutants discussed below might give rise to an “inverted” topology with the N-tail in the cytoplasm and the first loop in the periplasm. Because this would complicate the interpretation of the results, three positively charged arginine residues were inserted between positions 119 and 120 in the first cytoplasmic loop (mutant ProW1-182(3R)-Lep(P2)). As shown in Fig. 1B, the N-tail is translocated in this mutant as judged by its sensitivity to proteinase K added to intact spheroplasts (92% translocation; lanes 1 and 2), and translocation is not blocked by sodium azide (lanes 3 and 4), suggesting that SecA is not required(10.Oliver D.B. Cabelli R.J. Dolan K.M. Jarosik G.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 8227-8231Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). As for the original ProW1-182-Lep(P2) fusion(3.Whitley P. Zander T. Ehrmann M. Haardt M. Bremer E. von Heijne G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4653-4661Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), dissipation of the membrane electrochemical potential by the protonophore CCCP completely blocks translocation, leaving the entire fusion protein resistant to the externally added protease (lanes 5 and 6). We thus used the ProW1-182(3R)Lep(P2) mutant in all subsequent experiments. We have previously shown that a putative amphiphilic helix, residues 77-99, located at the C-terminal end of the ProW N-tail can be deleted without affecting translocation(3.Whitley P. Zander T. Ehrmann M. Haardt M. Bremer E. von Heijne G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4653-4661Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). To rule out that the N-terminal extremity of the N-tail contains a translocation signal, we deleted an acidic stretch near the N terminus (residues 5-25). As shown in Fig. 2, this deletion also has no effect on translocation, strongly suggesting that the N-tail does not contain a translocation signal. This is in agreement with earlier results showing that fusions between the ProW N-tail and PhoA are located in the cytoplasm(3.Whitley P. Zander T. Ehrmann M. Haardt M. Bremer E. von Heijne G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4653-4661Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Because we had previously found that the insertion of three arginine residues between positions 99 and 100 at the very end of the N-tail completely blocked translocation(3.Whitley P. Zander T. Ehrmann M. Haardt M. Bremer E. von Heijne G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4653-4661Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), we were interested to determine the minimum number of arginines required to block translocation and whether their effect on translocation depends on their position within the N-tail. To this end, a series of mutants with either one or two arginines inserted at various positions throughout the N-tail were constructed. As shown in Fig. 3A, a single arginine had a very strong effect when inserted between positions 99 and 100 (5% translocation; lanes 9 and 10), a milder effect when inserted between positions 32 and 33 and positions 82 and 83 (~30% translocation; lanes 3 and 4 and lanes 7 and 8), and was well tolerated when inserted between positions 4 and 5 and positions 65 and 66 (80-90% translocation; lanes 1 and 2 and lanes 5 and 6). Two arginines blocked translocation almost completely in all positions, again with the exception of positions 65 and 66 where 30% translocation was observed. For unknown reasons, we failed to express a mutant with two arginines inserted in position 5 despite repeated attempts. We conclude that translocation is particularly sensitive to the introduction of positively charged residues near the C-terminal region of the N-tail next to the first transmembrane segment. Nevertheless, two arginines introduced more than 60 residues away from the first transmembrane segment also block translocation almost completely. In the ProW1-182-Lep(P2) model protein, the N-tail is followed by three transmembrane segments and a large cytoplasmic domain. Previously, we found that the N-tail was translocated, albeit with reduced efficiency (~50%), when the Lep domain was fused after the first transmembrane segment(3.Whitley P. Zander T. Ehrmann M. Haardt M. Bremer E. von Heijne G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4653-4661Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). This suggested to us that the first transmembrane segment itself may be sufficient to induce translocation of the N-tail. Two ProW truncation mutants with stop codons placed in position 120 directly after the first transmembrane segment (residues 100-118) were made to test this possibility: one ending IAWQ119MM and the other ending IAWQ119MKKK. The two mutants differ by the presence of three extra positively charged lysines in the latter; methinonies were included to facilitate detection by pulse labeling with [35S]methionine. The topological analysis of the two mutants is presented in Fig. 4. The N-tail of the ProW1-119/MKKK mutant is partially translocated (65-70%) both in the absence (Fig. 4A, lanes 1 and 2) and presence (Fig. 4A, lanes 3 and 4) of sodium azide, and its translocation is thus independent of the SecA protein. Dissipation of the membrane electrochemical potential by CCCP prevents translocation (Fig. 4A, lanes 5 and 6). Note that translocation of the sec-dependent outer membrane protein OmpA is largely blocked by both azide and CCCP, resulting in accumulation of the precursor form pro-OmpA inside the cell. In contrast, the ProW1-119/MM mutant lacking C-terminal positively charged residues is resistant to protease digestion under all conditions (Fig. 4B), demonstrating that the N-tail is not translocated across the inner membrane. Possibly, the C-terminal end of the hydrophobic segment is translocated in this case, but this cannot be determined with the present protease assay. We conclude that the hydrophobic segment located at the extreme C terminus of the ProW1-119 truncation mutant can act as a signal for the SecA-independent translocation of the N-tail and that its orientation can be determined by flanking positively charged residues. Periplasmically exposed N-tails in E. coli inner membrane proteins contain few positively charged residues and appear to be translocated by a sec-independent mechanism irrespective of length(3.Whitley P. Zander T. Ehrmann M. Haardt M. Bremer E. von Heijne G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4653-4661Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 11.Cao G.Q. Dalbey R.E. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4662-4669Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). This is in contrast to long internal periplasmic loops and C-terminal tails for which translocation in most cases is sec-dependent (12.Sääf A. Andersson H. Gafvelin G. von Heijne G. Mol. Membr. Biol. 1995; 12: 209-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) and which can contain high numbers of positively charged residues(1.von Heijne G. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1994; 23: 167-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar, 13.Andersson H. von Heijne G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 9751-9754Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). In this paper, we show that the insertion of as little as a single arginine into the ProW N-tail can dramatically affect the efficiency of translocation, whereas two arginines fully block translocation (Fig. 3). The effects on translocation vary with the position of the arginine(s), but none of the double-arginine mutations tested is completely without effect. This suggests that the entire N-tail is critical for translocation, although our data indicate that its C-terminal extremity is more important than its central and N-terminal parts. Nevertheless, deletions near the N and C termini of the N-tail have no effect on translocation (Fig. 2 and (3.Whitley P. Zander T. Ehrmann M. Haardt M. Bremer E. von Heijne G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4653-4661Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar)). Thus, the simple rule that positively charged residues are not tolerated in the N-tail irrespective of position holds remarkably well. The ease with which the wild type N-tail can be translocated is even more dramatically illustrated by the finding that a truncation mutant composed only of the first 119 residues of ProW (i.e. the N-tail and the first transmembrane segment) followed by a methionine and three lysine inserts into the inner membrane with the N-tail exposed to the periplasm (Fig. 4). To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration that a hydrophobic segment located at the extreme C terminus of a protein can serve as a translocation signal for a large N-terminal domain. Previously, this has only been shown to be possible for small proteins such as the coat protein of phage Pf3(14.Kuhn A. Rohrer J. Gallusser A. J. Struct. Biol. 1990; 104: 38-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), which is composed of a single transmembrane segment flanked by 18 N-terminal and 8 C-terminal residues. As expected from the positive inside rule(1.von Heijne G. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1994; 23: 167-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar), translocation of the N-tail in the ProW1-119 truncation mutant is only observed when the hydrophobic segment is flanked on its C-terminal side by positively charged residues. Further, translocation of the N-tail is independent of the sec-machinery, as in all other ProW constructs tested to date. Because the translocation signal is located C-terminally to the N-tail, it seems reasonable to assume that the C-terminal end of the N-tail is translocated across the membrane at an early stage, in keeping with the “helical hairpin” hypothesis(15.Engelman D.M. Steitz T.A. Cell. 1981; 23: 411-422Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar). The position-dependent effects on translocation in the 1R series of mutants analyzed here (Fig. 3) also suggest that the C-terminal end of the N-tail is more critical for translocation than other parts. Previous studies have shown that a segment encompassing the first 20 residues on the C-terminal side of a normal signal peptide in a sec-dependent protein is critical for translocation and highly sensitive to the introduction of positively charged residues(15.Engelman D.M. Steitz T.A. Cell. 1981; 23: 411-422Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar), suggesting that the formation of a transmembrane helical hairpin may be an early step in both sec-dependent and sec-independent translocation mechanisms. Interestingly, an insertion of two arginines more than 60 residues away from the first transmembrane segment suffices to block export of the N-tail. It would seem that the initial formation of a helical hairpin comprising the first transmembrane segment and the preceding ~20 residues should not be influenced by this mutation; rather, it may be that the two basic residues prevent the ultimate translocation of the N-terminal end of the N-tail and force the chain to “slip back” through the membrane(16.Schiebel E. Driessen A.J.M. Hartl F.-U. Wickner W. Cell. 1991; 64: 927-939Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar).

The purified enzyme behaves as a 54-kDa protein under both denaturing and nondenaturing conditions, suggesting that it consists of a single polypeptide chain. It is inhibited by metal-chelating agents, including o-phenanthroline and NaCN, but not by inhibitors of serine proteases or thiol-blocking agents. Furthermore, protease Ci was found to contain 1.1 mol of zinc per mol of the enzyme upon analysis by HR ICP mass spectroscopy. Thus, protease Ci must be a zinc metalloprotease. Among the polypeptides tested as substrates, oxidized insulin B-chain and glucagon are most rapidly hydrolyzed. Intact insulin is a much poorer substrate than oxidized insulin B-chain, even though the affinity of the enzyme to intact insulin is approximately 100-fold greater than that to the B-chain. Since unlabeled oxidized insulin A-chain is capable of inhibiting the hydrolysis of 125I-labeled insulin B-chain, it also appears to be a substrate. Protease Ci also degrades lysozyme and lactalbumin, although to a much lesser extent than oxidized insulin B-chain. However, it shows little or no activity against proteins larger than 15 kDa (e.g. ovalbumin and denatured bovine serum albumin). Hydrolysis of oxidized insulin B-chain followed by amino acid composition analyses of the cleavage products reveals that as many as 10 of its 29 peptide bonds are hydrolyzed by protease Ci.

J. 1993; 290: 601-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), has been extensively characterized, although its physiological function is still unknown. Interestingly, protease Pi shares structural and functional homologies with the cytosolic insulin-degrading enzymes present in most mammalian cells(8.Affholter J.A. Fried V.A. Roth R.A. Science. 1988; 242: 1415-1418Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Overall amino acid sequence similarity between these enzymes is about 50% when conserved amino acid changes are included as matches. Furthermore, both the proteases contain three highly conserved domains, of which the first domain is characterized by the presence of a metal-binding site (9.Ding L. Becker A.B. Suzuki A. Roth R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2414-2420Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, it has been suggested that the three regions of homology may play an important role in the active site and catalytic mechanism of the proteases(8.Affholter J.A. Fried V.A. Roth R.A. Science. 1988; 242: 1415-1418Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). In addition to sharing sequence similarity, both protease Pi and human insulin-degrading enzyme have a molecular mass of about 110 kDa and require a divalent metal ion for activity(5.Cheng Y.E. Zipser D. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 4698-4706Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8.Affholter J.A. Fried V.A. Roth R.A. Science. 1988; 242: 1415-1418Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 9.Ding L. Becker A.B. Suzuki A. Roth R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2414-2420Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Both proteases have an isoelectric point of 5.3 and are maximally active in the pH range of 6.5-8.5. Both are sensitive to inhibition by bacitracin. However, they differ in sensitivity to sulfhydryl blocking agents, such as N-ethylmaleimide and iodoacetamide. While the human insulin-degrading enzyme is highly sensitive to these reagents, protease Pi is not. An insulin-degrading enzyme similar in its properties to the human enzyme and protease Pi has also been isolated from Drosophila melanogaster(10.Garcia J.V. Fenton B.W. Rosner M.R. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 4237-4244Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). E. coli in its cytoplasm contains an additional enzyme, protease Ci, that can degrade insulin(1.Chung C.H. Science. 1993; 262: 372-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 2.Goldberg A.L. Swamy K.H.S. Chung C.H. Larimore F.S. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 80: 680-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Aside from its subcellular location, protease Ci shows remarkable similarities to protease Pi. Like Pi, it appears to be 110-130 kDa, to have a pH optimum at 7.5, and to be sensitive to inhibition by metal-chelating agents and by the antibiotic bacitracin. However, all these properties were determined only on the partially purified protease Ci, whose physiological role is totally unknown. In the present studies, therefore, we purified protease Ci completely to carry out a detailed characterization of its biochemical and physicochemical properties, for determination of its cleavage specificity, and ultimately for elucidation of its physiological function. E. coli 3302 strain (HfrH ptr-3 lacZ727) (11.Cheng Y.E. Zipser D. Cheng C. Rolsth S.J. J. Bacteriol. 1979; 140: 125-130Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was grown in Luria broth, harvested at late log phase, and kept at −70°C until use. Protein substrates including insulin and oxidized insulin B-chain were radioiodinated using Iodo-Beads as described(12.Markwell M.A.K. Anal. Biochem. 1982; 125: 427-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar). Denatured bovine serum albumin (BSA) 1The abbreviations used are: BSAbovine serum albuminHPLChigh performance liquid chromatography. was prepared by reduction of disulfide bonds in the presence of 6 M guanidine HCl and alkylation with iodoacetamide (13.Hirs C.H.W. Methods Enzymol. 1967; 11: 197-199Crossref Scopus (879) Google Scholar). Iodo-Beads were obtained from Pierce; HiLoad Q, heparin-Sepharose, and phenyl-Sepharose were from Pharmacia Biotech Inc.; butyl-Toyopearl and TSK gel ODS-80TM column were from TOSOH Corp. (Japan). All others were purchased from Sigma. bovine serum albumin high performance liquid chromatography. Proteolysis was assayed as described (14.Woo K.M. Kim K.I. Goldberg A.L. Ha D.B. Chung C.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20429-20434Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The reaction mixtures (final volume, 0.1 ml) contained 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8), 5 mM MgCl2 and proper amounts of 125I-labeled protein substrates and the protease preparations. Incubations were performed at 37°C for 30-60 min. The amount of radioactive materials soluble in 10% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid was then determined using a γ counter. Proteins were assayed as described by Bradford (15.Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216033) Google Scholar) using BSA as a standard. Isoelectric focusing of proteins on 5% (w/v) polyacrylamide gels was carried out as described(16.O'Farrel P.Z. Goodman H.M. O'Farrel P.H. Cell. 1977; 12: 1133-1142Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2583) Google Scholar). The frozen E. coli cells (140 g) were thawed and suspended in 50 ml of buffer A (20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.8) and 5 mM MgCl2) containing 100 mM NaCl. The cells were disrupted with a French press at 14,000 psi and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 3 h. The supernatant was dialyzed against the same buffer and referred to as crude extract. The purified protease Ci preparation obtained from the final purification step (see below) was subjected to electrophoresis on 10% polyacrylamide slab gels containing SDS and 2-mercaptoethanol(17.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207129) Google Scholar). After briefly staining the gels with Coomassie Blue R-250, the protein band of the 54-kDa protease Ci was cut off and crushed. The sample was then subcutaneously injected into albino rabbits for the production of anti-protease Ci antiserum. IgGs were isolated from the antiserum by sodium sulfate fractionation (18.Johnstone A. Thrope P. Immunochemistry in Practice. Blackwell Scientific Publications, London1982: 43-46Google Scholar). Immunoblot analysis was performed using the antiserum or the anti-IgG as described(19.Blake M.S. Johnston K.H. Russell-Jones G.J. Gotschlich E.C. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 136: 175-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (1629) Google Scholar). Oxidized insulin B-chain was digested with the purified protease Ci for 0.5-15 h at 37°C. The cleavage products were subjected to reversed-phase HPLC using a C18 column (TSK gel ODS-80TM; 4.6 × 150 mm). The peptides bound to the column were eluted with a linear gradient of 1-35% (v/v) acetonitrile containing 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid. Elution of the peptides was monitored by their absorbance at 206 nm. Each of the peptide peaks was pooled, concentrated by evaporation, and again subjected to the reversed-phase HPLC. Homogeneous peptides were isolated, dried, and hydrolyzed in 6 N HCl and 0.1% (v/v) phenol at 140°C for 4 h under vacuum. The amino acid compositions of the peptides were then determined using an HPLC system (TOSOH Corp., Japan) equipped with a fluorescence detector (model FS8010) and a system controller (data processor, model SC8020). The purified protease Ci was extensively dialyzed against Milli-Q water with resistance of 18 megaohm. The Milli-Q water from the last dialysis was used as the reference. All the glasswares used in this study were boiled in 5% (v/v) HCl for 3 h to remove adventitious metal ions. Metal contents of the enzyme were then determined using an HR ICP mass spectrometer (model VG Plasma Trace). The crude extract (17.7 g of protein) was obtained from 140 g of E. coli 3302 strain that lacks protease Pi, degrading insulin and existing in the periplasmic space (2.Goldberg A.L. Swamy K.H.S. Chung C.H. Larimore F.S. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 80: 680-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 5.Cheng Y.E. Zipser D. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 4698-4706Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The extract was loaded onto a DEAE-Sepharose column (5 × 20 cm) equilibrated with buffer A containing 100 mM NaCl. After washing the column, proteins were eluted with a linear gradient of 100-250 mM NaCl and assayed for proteolysis. As shown in Fig. 1, a single peak of proteolytic activity appeared at about 170 mM NaCl, whether 125I-labeled insulin or oxidized insulin B-chain was used as the substrate. However, oxidized insulin B-chain was hydrolyzed at a rate at least 50-fold faster than intact insulin (also see below). Therefore, we used oxidized insulin B-chain as the substrate for further purification and characterization of protease Ci, although this enzyme had initially been identified using intact insulin as its substrate(2.Goldberg A.L. Swamy K.H.S. Chung C.H. Larimore F.S. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 80: 680-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 20.Swamy K.H.S. Goldberg A.L. Nature. 1981; 292: 652-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The fractions containing high activity were pooled and applied to a HiLoad Q column (2.6 × 10 cm) equilibrated with buffer A containing 150 mM NaCl. Proteins bound to the column were eluted with a linear gradient of 150-300 mM NaCl. The active fractions were pooled, dialyzed against buffer A, and loaded onto a heparin-Sepharose column (1.5 × 8 cm) equilibrated with the same buffer. Proteins that did not bind to the column were collected, and a saturated (NH4)2SO4 solution (pH 7.8) was added to a final concentration of 1 M. The sample was then loaded onto a phenyl-Sepharose column (1 × 6 cm) equilibrated with buffer A containing 1 M (NH4)2SO4. Proteins bound to the column were eluted by decreasing linearly the salt concentration to 0.01 M. The peak of oxidized insulin B-chain-degrading activity was eluted at about 0.17 M (NH4)2SO4 (Fig. 2A). The fractions containing high activity were pooled, adjusted to 1.2 M (NH4)2SO4, and loaded onto a butyl-Toyopearl column (1 × 4 cm) equilibrated with buffer A containing 1.2 M (NH4)2SO4. Proteins were eluted by decreasing the salt concentration to 0.1 M. Active fractions were pooled, adjusted to 1.5 M (NH4)2SO4, and again loaded onto the same butyl-Toyopearl column but equilibrated with 1.5 M (NH4)2SO4. Proteins were eluted as above but by decreasing the salt concentration to 0.9 M. The fractions containing high activity (Fig. 2B) were pooled, added with glycerol to a final concentration of 20% (v/v), and kept at −70°C for further use. Summary of the purification of protease Ci is shown in Table 1.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab The subunit size of protease Ci was estimated to be 54 kDa upon analysis by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of SDS and 2-mercaptoethanol (Fig. 3A, lane b). Only a single band could be seen in the gel, indicating that protease Ci was purified to apparent homogeneity. To determine the size of the protease under nondenaturing conditions, the purified enzyme was subjected to gel filtration on a Superose-12 column (1 × 30 cm). Fig. 4 shows that the peak activity of purified protease Ci (closed circles) is eluted in the fractions corresponding to about 54 kDa. Thus, the enzyme consists of a single polypeptide chain. The isoelectric point of protease Ci was estimated to be about 5.2 upon analysis by isoelectric focusing on a 5% polyacrylamide gel.Figure 4:Gel filtration of the protease Ci preparations on a Superose-12 column. The purified protease Ci (•) and the enzyme preparation obtained from the DEAE-Sepharose column of Fig. 1(○) were chromatographed on a Superose-12 column (1 × 30 cm) equilibrated with buffer A containing 100 mM NaCl. Fractions of 0.5 ml were collected at a flow rate of 20 ml/h, and an aliquot was assayed for hydrolysis of 125I-labeled insulin B-chain. Size markers used were as follows: a, β-amylase (200 kDa); b, alcohol dehydrogenase (150 kDa); c, BSA (66 kDa); d, carbonic anhydrase (29 kDa).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) However, the native size of protease Ci had been reported to be in the range of 110-130 kDa, although the prior studies used crude preparations of the enzyme for the size estimation(2.Goldberg A.L. Swamy K.H.S. Chung C.H. Larimore F.S. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 80: 680-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). To resolve this discrepancy, the enzyme preparations obtained from the DEAE-Sepharose column (see Fig. 1) were also subjected to gel filtration using the Superose-12 column. As was reported earlier, the activity of protease Ci was eluted in the fractions corresponding to about 110 kDa (Fig. 4, open circles). On the other hand, the enzyme preparation obtained after the HiLoad Q column, which removed more than 98% of total proteins, consistently ran as a 54-kDa protein, just as the purified protease did (data not shown). However, when the gel filtration chromatography was performed in the presence of 8 M urea and the resulting column fractions were subjected to immunoblot analysis using the antiserum raised against the purified protease Ci, the peaks of both the DEAE and purified enzyme preparations were found to elute in the fractions corresponding to about 54 kDa (data not shown). These results suggest that the size change may be due to dissociation of the subunits or removal of certain protein(s) that might have been nonspecifically bound to protease Ci. We also tested whether the change in the size of protease Ci is due to limited proteolysis of the enzyme during purification. The E. coli cells grown to mid-log phase were harvested, immediately boiled, electrophoresed in the presence of 2-mercaptoethanol, and subjected to immunoblot analysis as above. This antiserum mainly interacted with the 54-kDa protein and not with any protein of 110 kDa (Fig. 3B, lane a). The minor bands seen in the gel could also be detected with the preimmune serum (data not shown). The identical data were obtained when the same experiments were performed under nonreducing conditions. Thus, the change in the size of protease Ci is not due to limited cleavage during purification of the enzyme either by itself or by other contaminating E. coli proteases. These results indicate that the 54-kDa protein responsible for the insulin degradation is protease Ci. The effects of various protease inhibitors and site-specific reagents were tested by incubating the purified protease Ci for 20 min at 37°C prior to the addition of 125I-labeled insulin B-chain. As shown in Table 2, o-phenanthroline at 1 mM inhibited the enzyme activity by about 50%. NaCN, which also is known to inhibit metalloproteases(21.Czekay G. Bauer K. Biochem. J. 1993; 290: 921-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), reduced the activity by about 80% at 1 mM. In addition, the antibiotic bacitracin at 0.7 mM inhibited the enzyme by about 90%. However, protease Ci was not sensitive to inhibitors of serine proteases, such as diisopropyl fluorophosphate and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, or of sulfhydryl proteases, including N-ethylmaleimide and iodoacetamide. It is also not sensitive to various antibiotic peptide aldehyde inhibitors tested, such as leupeptin, antipain, chymostatin, and bestatin, nor to the epoxide, E-64. Thus, protease Ci appears to be a metalloprotease. Nearly identical results were obtained when intact insulin was used as the substrate (data not shown).Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab To clarify further the requirement for metal ions, protease Ci was preincubated with 0.2 mM NaCN for 20 min, which blocked the initial enzyme activity by about 65%. Various metal ions were then added to determine whether any of them can reactivate the enzyme. As shown in Table 3, protease Ci could be reactivated by Co2+, Mn2+, and Cu2+ in the order of their effectiveness but not by Ca2+, Mg2+, and Zn2+ at the concentrations tested. Without the preincubation, however, Zn2+, Co2+, and Cu2+ strongly inhibited the activity of protease Ci while Mg2+, Ca2+, and Mn2+ were stimulatory (data not shown). Thus, it appeared as if protease Ci uses Co2+ as its metal cofactor.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab To determine whether protease Ci indeed contains Co2+, HR-ICP mass spectral analyses of two different preparations of the purified enzyme were performed. The enzyme contained 1.51 and 1.26 μg of Zn2+ per mg of protein. Assuming a size of 54 kDa, this is equivalent to a mean of 1.1 mol of Zn2+ per mol of protease Ci. Although the NaCN-treated enzyme could be reactivated most effectively by Co2+ and not by Zn2+, it is a well known fact that metalloproteases that use Zn2+ as the natural metal cofactor can be inhibited when incubated with excess Zn2+. In addition, in some cases (e.g. metallocarboxypeptidases), Co2+ activates the enzyme severalfold over the activity seen with the native Zn2+-containing enzyme(22.Folk J.E. Gladner J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1960; 235: 60-63Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23.Vallee B.L. Rupley J.A. Coombs T.L. Neurath H. J. Biol. Chem. 1960; 235: 64-69Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar, 24.Coleman J.E. Vallee B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1960; 235: 390-395Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, protease Ci is likely to be a Zn2+ metalloprotease. To determine the time course for hydrolysis of 125I-labeled insulin and oxidized insulin B-chain, the purified protease Ci was incubated with these substrates for varying periods. As shown in Fig. 5, hydrolysis of both polypeptides increased linearly for the duration of incubation. In addition, this result again shows that oxidized insulin B-chain is much more rapidly degraded than intact insulin. From these data, the specific activity of protease Ci against intact insulin was estimated to be 2.5 nmol/min/mg, which is comparable to that of Drosophila insulin-degrading enzyme (3.3 nmol/min/mg)(10.Garcia J.V. Fenton B.W. Rosner M.R. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 4237-4244Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). We then examined whether protease Ci can also hydrolyze oxidized insulin A-chain. The activity of the purified enzyme against 125I-labeled B-chain was measured in the presence of increasing amounts of the unlabeled A-chain. As shown in Fig. 6, the insulin A-chain (like unlabeled intact insulin and oxidized B-chain) could competitively reduce breakdown of the radiolabeled B-chain. These results suggest that protease Ci is also capable of hydrolyzing oxidized insulin A-chain. In addition, unlabeled intact insulin molecules were able to inhibit the hydrolysis of 125I-labeled B-chain, even more effectively than any of A- or B-chain. From these data, the Ki values of the competing, unlabeled intact insulin and oxidized insulin B-chain molecules were estimated to be 0.13 and 12.4 μM, respectively. These results suggest that the affinity of protease Ci for intact insulin is about 100-fold higher than that of oxidized insulin B-chain, despite the fact that the latter polypeptide is much more rapidly hydrolyzed by the enzyme than intact insulin. A variety of 125I-labeled proteins of different sizes was also tested for susceptibility to the purified protease Ci. Glucagon was also rapidly degraded by the enzyme but approximately 20% as fast as oxidized insulin B-chain (Table 4). Protease Ci was also capable of degrading polypeptides with sizes smaller than 15 kDa, such as lactalbumin and lysozyme, although to a much lesser extent than oxidized insulin B-chain. However, it showed little or no activity against any larger proteins tested, such as BSA, denatured BSA, ovalbumin, carbonic anhydrase, and globin. In addition, protease Ci cleaved angiotensin I and the synthetic peptide that is used as a substrate of a tyrosine-protein kinase (RRLIEDAEYAARG) (25.Casnellie J.E. Harrison M.L. Pike L.J. Hellstrom K.E. Krebs E.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 282-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar) upon analysis of their incubation mixture on HPLC. However, it failed to cleave Leu-enkephalin and bradykinin. Therefore, it is tempting to speculate that protease Ci may preferentially hydrolyze the peptides with amino acids ranging from 10 to 150.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab To determine the peptide bond specificity of protease Ci, oxidized insulin B-chain was incubated with the enzyme for various periods, and the reaction products were separated by reversed-phase HPLC using a C18 column. Whether the incubations were performed for 2 or 15 h, the same 14 peptide peaks were detected by absorbance at 206 nm (Fig. 7). Upon prolonged incubation, however, the areas under the peaks 5, 8, 9, 10, 12, and 14 markedly decreased, while those under peaks 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 11, and 13 increased significantly. Thus, it appears likely that the peptides in the former peaks behave as intermediates in degradation by protease Ci. When the individual peaks were rechromatographed on the same column but using a shallow gradient of acetonitrile, each of the peaks 4, 8, and 12 was further separated into two distinct peaks (data not shown). The cleavage sites on oxidized insulin B-chain were then determined by analysis of the amino acid composition of each of the purified peptides. Fig. 8 summarizes the amino acid sequences of the peptides deduced from their amino acid compositions. In accord with the results from the reversed phase chromatography, a number of peptides appeared to behave as intermediates in degradation, such as peptide 8b for peptides 1 and 4a, 12b for 2 and 11, and 14 for 2 and 13. Peptide 5 may also be an intermediate in the generation of peptide 1 and LCGSH. However, the latter pentapeptide was not found among the 14 peaks and may correspond to any of the minor peaks whose amino acid composition was not determined. These results strongly suggest that protease Ci preferentially cleaves on the amino side of hydrophobic amino acids (i.e. the peptide bonds of His5-Leu6, His10-Leu11, Leu11-Val12, Glu13-Ala14, Ala14-Leu15, Tyr16-Leu17, Leu17-Val18). Secondary cleavages occurred on the amino side of tyrosine (i.e. Leu15-Tyr16, Phe25-Tyr26). The only exception is peptide 4b generated by the cleavage of the amino side of glutamic acid (i.e. Val12-Glu13). To examine whether peptide 4b is produced by trace contaminating proteases under the incubation conditions, the same experiment was performed using the purified protease Ci that had been treated with a mixture of protease inhibitors (1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mMN-ethylmaleimide, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, and 5 μg/ml E-64), which do not inhibit protease Ci (see Table 2), followed by dialysis against buffer A to remove the inhibitors. However, peptide 4b was consistently generated with the others. On the other hand, when the cleavage of insulin B-chain was carried out with the supernatant fraction obtained after immunoprecipitation of the purified enzyme using anti-protease Ci IgG, no peptide was generated. Therefore, it remains uncertain whether peptide 4b is one of the authentic cleavage products or generated by trace contaminating proteases in the purified protease Ci preparation. In the present studies, a cytoplasmic metalloprotease in E. coli, protease Ci, was purified to apparent homogeneity using 125I-labeled oxidized insulin B-chain as a substrate. Since E. coli contains an additional insulin B-chain-degrading enzyme, protease Pi, in the periplasm(2.Goldberg A.L. Swamy K.H.S. Chung C.H. Larimore F.S. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 80: 680-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 6.Swamy K.H.S. Goldberg A.L. J. Bacteriol. 1982; 149: 1027-1033Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we used E. coli 3302 strain, which lacks the periplasmic enzyme. From 140 g of the frozen cells, we obtained 90 μg of purified protease Ci with a final yield of about 1.5%. Thus, protease Ci accounts for at least 0.03% of the soluble protein of E. coli. Protease Ci was found to have much higher affinity for intact insulin than for oxidized insulin B-chain, despite the fact that the latter polypeptide is hydrolyzed approximately 50-fold more rapidly than intact insulin. Similar results have been reported for protease Pi(7.Anastasi A. Knight C.G. Barrett A.J. Biochem. J. 1993; 290: 601-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Therefore, it appears possible that dissociation of intact insulin and/or its cleavage products from the enzyme may be a rate-limiting step for degradation of additional insulin molecules. In this regard, the characteristics of low kcat and low Km are not unlike those of small protein inhibitors of proteases(26.Laskowski Jr., M. Kato I. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1980; 49: 593-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (1942) Google Scholar), as was noted by Barrett and co-workers (7.Anastasi A. Knight C.G. Barrett A.J. Biochem. J. 1993; 290: 601-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) for protease Pi. Protease Ci, like protease Pi(5.Cheng Y.E. Zipser D. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 4698-4706Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9.Ding L. Becker A.B. Suzuki A. Roth R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2414-2420Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), is not inhibited by sulfhydryl blocking agents, such as N-ethylmaleimide and iodoacetamide. This insensitivity of the bacterial enzymes distinguishes them from the human and Drosophila insulin-degrading enzymes that are highly susceptible to inactivation by such reagents(9.Ding L. Becker A.B. Suzuki A. Roth R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2414-2420Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10.Garcia J.V. Fenton B.W. Rosner M.R. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 4237-4244Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The predicted amino acid sequence of protease Pi contains a single Cys residue(27.Finch P.W. Wilson R.E. Brown K. Hickson I.D. Emmerson P.T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 7695-7703Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), whereas the human insulin-degrading enzyme has 12 Cys residues(8.Affholter J.A. Fried V.A. Roth R.A. Science. 1988; 242: 1415-1418Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). One of the Cys residues in the human enzyme is present in the metal-binding site (HXCXH) in the first highly conserved domains of insulin-degrading enzymes(28.Vallee B.L. Auld D.S. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 5647-5659Crossref PubMed Scopus (1527) Google Scholar). Protease Pi also contains the metal-binding motif (HXXXH) but lacks the Cys residue(27.Finch P.W. Wilson R.E. Brown K. Hickson I.D. Emmerson P.T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 7695-7703Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Protease Ci may contain a similar metal-binding site to that of protease Pi, which might explain its lack of sensitivity to sulfhydryl-modifying agents. Isolation and sequence determination of the DNA clone for protease Ci should reveal whether this is true. Protease Ci is capable of hydrolyzing as many as 10 sites among the total 29 peptide bonds in oxidized insulin B-chain. In contrast, protease Pi cleaves only the Tyr16-Leu17 bond(7.Anastasi A. Knight C.G. Barrett A.J. Biochem. J. 1993; 290: 601-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), which is also hydrolyzed by protease Ci. Like protease Ci, the insulin-degrading enzymes from Drosophila and rat also hydrolyze multiple peptide bonds in the insulin B-chain(29.Duckworth W.C. Garcia J.V. Liepnieks J.J. Hamel F.G.

In addition, all the peptide bonds hydrolyzed by the various eukaryotic insulin-degrading enzymes are also sensitive to degradation by protease Ci, except for the Ser9-His10 bond and the Phe24-Phe25 bond, which are cleaved only by the rat enzyme(29.Duckworth W.C.

Protease Ci appears to preferentially degrade relatively small-sized polypeptides, in contrast with other soluble proteases in the cytoplasm of E. coli, proteases Do (DegP), Re (Tsp), Mi, Fa, So, La (Lon), and Ti (Clp)(1.Chung C.H. Science. 1993; 262: 372-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 2.Goldberg A.L. Swamy K.H.S. Chung C.H. Larimore F.S. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 80: 680-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). In addition to oxidized insulin B-chain, protease Ci rapidly hydrolyzed glucagon and degraded lactalbumin and lysozyme, although at much slower rates. However, little or no trichloroacetic acid-soluble products are generated by the purified protease from any protein tested that is larger than 15 kDa. Interestingly, when proteins larger than 15 kDa, such as casein, were incubated with the ATP-dependent protease La or Ti in the presence of protease Ci, the production of acid-soluble products was over 2-fold faster than in its absence. 2K. I. Kim and C. H. Chung, unpublished observation. The ATP-dependent proteases appear to catalyze the initial rate-limiting steps in the degradation of highly abnormal polypeptides and of certain normal proteins(3.Goldberg A.L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 203: 9-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar, 4.Gottesman S. Maurizi M.R. Microbiol. Rev. 1992; 56: 592-621Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, protease Ci may function subsequently in the pathway for intracellular protein breakdown and digest the oligopeptides generated by the ATP-dependent endoproteases.

Upon the protein disulfide reduction with dithiothreitol under nondenaturing conditions, the intermediate species with four, three, and two disulfides were generated. The partially disulfide-reduced intermediates were isolated, and the localization of intact disulfides in the intermediates was determined by an indirect end-labeling method. This method included the S-cyanocysteine-specific protein fragmentation, followed by gel electrophoresis and the immunochemical visualization of the C terminus-intact fragments using antiserum raised against a non-cysteine C-terminal fragment (Ser280-Arg332). Results clearly showed that first SS-IV and SS-V, second SS-III, and then SS-VI are cleaved. No reduction was observed for SS-I and SS-II under the employed reducing conditions. The conclusion was confirmed by peptide mapping analyses for the same disulfide intermediates using reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography. Transverse urea gradient gel electrophoresis and visible absorption spectra revealed that the four-disulfide intermediate, but not the three- or two-disulfide intermediate, retains essentially the same iron-binding function as the native protein. By far-UV CD analyses, the residual native conformation of the partially disulfide-reduced intermediates was found to decrease with increased number of the reduced disulfides. Implications of the partially disulfide-reduced intermediates for the disulfide-reductive unfolding pathway in ovotransferrin N lobe are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2009270777,"Abstract Small plasmids replicate efficiently in unfertilized Xenopus eggs provided they are injected before rather than after activation of the cell cycle. Here we use Xenopus egg extracts to test the hypothesis that efficient replication results from chromatin assembly prior to activation giving preloaded plasmids a head start toward the formation of a replicating pseudonucleus (Sanchez, J. A., Marek, D., and Wangh, L. J.(1992) J. Cell Sci. 103, 907-918). As in ovum, plasmid DNA preincubated in unactivated egg cytoplasmcytostatic factor extracts) replicate more efficiently after extract activation than does the same DNA added to the same extract after activation. Unlike in ovum, however, plasmids that replicate efficiently in vitro do not assemble into chromatin during preincubation and become topologically knotted instead. But even DNA knotting does not explain subsequent efficient replication. Also, plasmids preassembled into chromatin in vitro do not replicate efficiently in activated egg cytoplasm unless first preincubated in a CSF extract. We conclude that unactivated eggs contain replication-enhancing activities that can act independently of plasmid chromatin assembly and DNA topology. These postulated “preloading” factor(s) may be related to licensing factor, an activity that controls initiation of DNA replication in eukaryotic cells. The experimental conditions described here will permit characterization of preloading/licensing factor(s) in the context of a small plasmid substrate."
https://openalex.org/W2185192754,"everything from Haiti to health care seems to be “reinventing government.” Unfortunately, this sweeping project, which the president touts repeatedly, has become something of a totem, inspiring much reverence but little reflection. Although it is difficult to object to shrinking the size of the federal bureaucracy and making it more efficient, an examination of what reinventing government has actually wrought and its prospects for American science and technology are cause for alarm. First, consider that the project is in the hands of one of the most ideologically extreme and rigid members of the administration: vice president Al Gore. Second, even though there may have been some overall reductions in government personnel and organizations, critical regulatory policies at several agencies have, in fact, expanded the federal government’s mandate and its intrusiveness, with policies determined more by political correctness and the vice president’s idiosyncratic views than by what is good for public health or the environment. Finally, Gore’s approach to reinventing government has been characterized by a desire to purge dissenting views from both the councils of government and the ranks of federal agencies."
