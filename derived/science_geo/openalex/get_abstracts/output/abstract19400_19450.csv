https://openalex.org/W2025864476,"Binding of human growth hormone (hGH) to its receptor is required for regulation of normal human growth and development. Examination of the 2.8 angstrom crystal structure of the complex between the hormone and the extracellular domain of its receptor (hGHbp) showed that the complex consists of one molecule of growth hormone per two molecules of receptor. The hormone is a four-helix bundle with an unusual topology. The binding protein contains two distinct domains, similar in some respects to immunoglobulin domains. The relative orientation of these domains differs from that found between constant and variable domains in immunoglobulin Fab fragments. Both hGHbp domains contribute residues that participate in hGH binding. In the complex both receptors donate essentially the same residues to interact with the hormone, even though the two binding sites on hGH have no structural similarity. Generally, the hormone-receptor interfaces match those identified by previous mutational analyses. In addition to the hormone-receptor interfaces, there is also a substantial contact surface between the carboxyl-terminal domains of the receptors. The relative extents of the contact areas support a sequential mechanism for dimerization that may be crucial for signal transduction."

The ABP-deficient cells have impaired locomotion and display circumferential blebbing of the plasma membrane. Expression of ABP in one of the lines after transfection restored translocational motility and reduced membrane blebbing. These findings establish that ABP functions to stabilize cortical actin in vivo and is required for efficient cell locomotion."
https://openalex.org/W2013413397,"K+ channels are quite variable in their sensitivity to the pore-blocking agent tetraethylammonium ion (TEA) when it is applied to the extracellular side of the membrane. A Shaker K+ channel can be made highly sensitive by introducing a tyrosine (or phenylalanine) at residue 449 in each of the four subunits. A shift in the voltage dependence of blockade indicates that TEA senses a smaller fraction of the transmembrane electric field in the highly sensitive channels. There is a linear relationship between the free energy for TEA blockade and the number of subunits (zero, two, or four) containing tyrosine at 449, as if these four residues interact simultaneously with a TEA molecule to produce a high affinity binding site. The temperature dependence of blockade suggests that the interaction is not purely hydrophobic. These findings are consistent with a TEA-binding site formed by a bracelet of pore-lining aromatic residues. The center of the bracelet could bind a TEA molecule through a cation-pi orbital interaction."
https://openalex.org/W2087151511,"A gene that encodes systemin, a mobile 18-amino acid polypeptide inducer of proteinase inhibitor synthesis in tomato and potato leaves, has been isolated from tomato, Lycopersicon esculentum. Induction of proteinase inhibitors in plants is a response to insect or pathogen attacks. The gene has 10 introns and 11 exons, ten of which are organized as five homologous pairs with an unrelated sequence in the eleventh, encoding systemin. Systemin is proteolytically processed from a 200-amino acid precursor protein, prosystemin. Prosystemin messenger RNA was found in all organs of the plant except the roots and was systemically wound-inducible in leaves. Tomato plants transformed with an antisense prosystemin complementary DNA exhibited greatly suppressed systemic wound induction of proteinase Inhibitor I and II synthesis in leaves."
https://openalex.org/W1963621662,"von Recklinghausen's neurofibromatosis (NF1) is a common inherited human disease. The events leading to patient symptoms from inheritance of a defective NF1 gene are unknown. Since knowledge of the distribution of the normal NF1 gene product should improve understanding of the pathogenesis of the disease, we raised antibodies against peptides coded by portions of the recently cloned human NF1 cDNA. These antibodies specifically recognize a 220 kd protein (neurofibromin) in both human and rat spinal cord. Neurofibromin is most abundant in the nervous system. Immunostaining of tissue sections indicates that neurons, oligodendrocytes, and nonmyelinating Schwann cells contain neurofibromin while astrocytes and myelinating Schwann cells do not. These results suggest a function for neurofibromin in the normal nervous system. Some NF1 disease manifestations, such as Schwann cell tumors and learning disabilities, may result from abnormalities in the cells that express neurofibromin."
https://openalex.org/W1493623656,"beta-Ketoacyl-acyl carrier protein (ACP) synthase III catalyzes the condensation of acetyl-CoA with malonyl-ACP in dissociated (Type II) fatty acid synthase systems. A synthase III mutant was used to localize the structural gene to the 24.5-min region of the Escherichia coli chromosome, and the defective synthase III allele was designated fabH1. The fabH gene was identified on a 1.3-kilobase NruI-HindIII chromosomal DNA fragment (plasmid pWO114) that complemented the enzymatic defect in fabH1 strains. The NruI-HindIII fragment was sequenced and contained a single open reading frame predicted to encode a 33,517-dalton protein with an isoelectric point of 4.85. The fabH sequence contained an Ala-Cys-Ala tripeptide characteristic of condensing enzyme active sites. A T7 expression system showed that the NruI-HindIII fragment directed the synthesis of a single 34,800-dalton protein. This protein was purified and the order of the amino-terminal 30 residues of the protein corresponded exactly to the amino acid structure predicted from the DNA sequence. The purified protein possessed both acetoacetyl-ACP synthase and acetyl-CoA:ACP transacylase activities, and cells harboring plasmid pWO114 overproduced the two activities, supporting the conclusion that a single protein carries out both reactions. Overproduction of synthase III resulted in a significant increase in shorter-chain fatty acids in the membrane phospholipids. These catalytic properties are consistent with the proposed role of synthase III in the initiation of fatty acid synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W2091604918,"We have investigated the NGF dependence of dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons in mammals using a paradigm of multiple in utero injections of a high titer anti-NGF antiserum. We have determined the specificity of our antiserum in relation to other members of the NGF neurotrophin family and found no cross-reactivity with brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) or neurotrophin-3 (NT-3). To identify various classes of DRG neurons, we have stained their characteristic central projections with Dil. We show here that the NGF dependence of DRG neurons is strikingly selective. Although a majority of DRG neurons are lost after NGF deprivation during embryonic life, these are almost exclusively small diameter neurons that project to laminae I and II of the dorsal horn and presumably subserve nociception and thermoreception. Larger neurons that project to more ventral spinal laminae and subserve other sensory modalities do not require NGF for survival. These NGF-independent DRG neurons likely require one of the more recently identified neurotrophins, BDNF or NT-3."
https://openalex.org/W1567204873,"CenA is a bacterial cellulase (beta-1,4-glucanase) comprised of a globular catalytic domain joined to an extended cellulose-binding domain (CBD) by a short linker peptide. The adsorption of CenA and its two isolated domains to crystalline cellulose was analyzed. CenA and CBD.PTCenA' (the CBD plus linker) adsorbed rapidly to cellulose at 30 degrees C, and no net desorption of protein was observed during the following 16.7 h. There was no detectable adsorption of the catalytic domain. Scatchard plots of adsorption data for CenA and for CBD.PTCenA were nonlinear (concave upward). The adsorption of CenA and CBD.PTCenA exceeded 7 and 8 mumol/g cellulose, respectively, but saturation was not attained at the highest total protein concentrations employed. A new model for adsorption was developed to describe the interaction of a large ligand (protein) with a lattice of overlapping potential binding sites (cellobiose residues). A relative equilibrium association constant (Kr) of 40.5 and 45.3 liter.g cellulose-1 was estimated for CenA and CBD.PTCenA, respectively, according to this model. A similar Kr value (33.3 liter.g-1) was also obtained for Cex, a Cellulomonas fimi enzyme which contains a related CBD but which hydrolyzes both beta 1,4-xylosidic and beta-1,4-glucosidic bonds. It was estimated that the CBD occupies approximately 39 cellobiose residues on the cellulose surface."
https://openalex.org/W2029227663,"The suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) of the hypothalamus comprise the primary pacemaker responsible for generation of circadian rhythms in mammals. Light stimuli that synchronize this circadian clock induce expression of the c-fos gene in rodent SCN, which suggests a possible role for Fos in circadian entrainment. Appropriate light stimuli also induce the expression of jun-B messenger RNA in the SCN of golden hamsters but only slightly elevate c-jun messenger RNA levels. In addition, light increases the amount of a protein complex in the SCN that binds specifically to sites on DNA known to mediate regulation by the AP-1 transcription factor. The photic regulation of both jun-B messenger RNA expression and AP-1 binding activity is dependent on circadian phase: only light stimuli that shift behavioral rhythms induce jun-B and AP-1 expression. Thus, light and the circadian pacemaker interact to regulate a specific set of immediate-early genes in the SCN that may participate in entrainment of the circadian clock."
https://openalex.org/W1580883143,"The influence of cytokines on extracellular superoxide dismutase (EC-SOD) expression by human dermal fibroblasts was investigated. The expression was markedly stimulated by interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), was varying between fibroblast lines stimulated or depressed by interleukin-1 alpha (IL-1 alpha), was intermediately depressed by tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), and markedly depressed by transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta). TNF-alpha, however, enhanced the stimulation by a high dose of IFN-gamma, whereas TGF-beta markedly depressed the stimulations given by IFN-gamma and IL-1 alpha. The ratio between the maximal stimulation and depression observed was around 30-fold. The responses were generally slow and developed over periods of several days. There were no effects of IFN-alpha, IL-2, IL-3, IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, human growth hormone, Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide, leukotriene B4, prostaglandin E2, formylmethionylleucylphenylalanine, platelet-activating factor, and indomethacin. The cytokines influencing the EC-SOD expression are also known to influence superoxide production by leukocytes and other cell types, and the EC-SOD response pattern is roughly compatible with the notion that its function is to protect cells against extracellular superoxide radicals. The results show that EC-SOD is a participant in the complex inflammatory response orchestrated by cytokines. The CuZn-SOD activity of the fibroblasts was not influenced by any of the cytokines, whereas the Mn-SOD activity was depressed by TGF-beta. TNF-alpha, IL-1 alpha, and IFN-gamma stimulated the Mn-SOD activity, as previously known, and these responses were reduced by TGF-beta. The different responses of the three SOD isoenzymes illustrate their different physiological roles."
https://openalex.org/W1559096719,"The gene encoding the multifunctional protein (MFP) of peroxisomal beta-oxidation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae was isolated from a genomic library via functional complementation of a fox2 mutant strain. The open reading frame consists of 2700 base pairs encoding a protein of 900 amino acids. The predicted molecular weight (98,759) is in close agreement with that of the isolated polypeptide (96,000). Analysis of the deduced amino acid sequence revealed similarity to the MFPs of two other fungi but not to that of rat peroxisomes or the multifunctional subunit of the Escherichia coli beta-oxidation complex. The FOX2 gene was overexpressed from a multicopy vector (YEp352) in S. cerevisiae and the gene product purified to apparent homogeneity. A truncated version of MFP lacking 271 carboxyl-terminal amino acids was also overexpressed and purified. Experiments to study the enzymatic properties of the wild-type MFP demonstrated an absence of activities originally assigned to an MFP of S. cerevisiae (crotonase, L-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase, and 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA epimerase), whereas two other activities were found: 2-enoyl-CoA hydratase 2 (converting trans-2-enoyl-CoA to D-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA) and D-3-hydroxyacyl CoA dehydrogenase (converting D-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA to 3-ketoacyl-CoA). The truncated form contained only the D-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase activity. These results clearly demonstrate that the beta-oxidation of fatty acids in S. cerevisiae follows a previously unknown stereochemical course, namely it occurs via a D-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA intermediate."
https://openalex.org/W1627542733,"Abstract We have purified two 28-kDa chitinases, designated Chitinase A (Chit A) and Chitinase B (Chit B), from maize seeds to homogeneity and isolated cDNA clones encoding these two enzymes using an oligonucleotide probe based on an amino acid sequence of a peptide derived from Chit A. Although these two enzymes share 87% homology in their amino acid sequences, which were deduced from the nucleotide sequences of the isolated cDNA clones, they are significantly different in their biochemical and in vitro antifungal activities. When tested in vitro for antifungal activity against the growth of Trichoderma reesei, Alternaria solani, and Fusarium oxysporum, Chit A showed greater antifungal activity than Chit B. The specific activity of Chit A was determined to be 3-fold higher than that of Chit B. Chit A also had a 10-fold lower binding constant (Kd) against the substrate analogue N,N',N'',N'''-tetraacetyl chitotetrose than Chit B, indicating that the two enzyme may differ in their affinities for binding to the substrate chitin. Comparison of the amino acid sequences of maize seed chitinases with those of previously published chitinases from monocot and dicot plants indicates that maize seed chitinases have diverged significantly from other chitinases."
https://openalex.org/W153121970,"The nucleocapsid protein (NC) of all animal retroviruses, encoded by the gag gene, is the major structural protein of the core ribonucleoprotein complex, bound to genomic RNA in mature virions. NC is also thought to play one or more accessory roles in reverse transcription. Mature NC (p7NC) from human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) is a 71-amino acid, basic protein which contains two Cys3His Zn(II) retroviral-type zinc finger domains. Herein, we describe the subcloning and expression of HIV-1 NC, denoted NC71, from an inducible phage T7 RNA polymerase promoter in Escherichia coli. Purified NC71 can be reversibly reconstituted with 2 g.at Zn(II) determined by atomic absorption. Ultraviolet circulation dichroism spectroscopy has been used to characterize the complexes between highly purified NC71 and the RNA homopolynucleotide poly(A) and E. coli tRNA(mixed). On poly(A), Zn2 NC71 is characterized by an apparent site size n = 15 +/- 3 nucleotides and high affinity (Kapp = 3 x 10(7) M-1) and moderately cooperative (omega approximately 170 +/- 25) binding. A mixture of E. coli tRNA species (tRNA(mixed) was used to probe the conformational changes induced in tRNA upon binding of HIV-1 NC71. Two structural forms of tRNA(mixed), which differ in their degree of tertiary structure, were assayed for their susceptibility to denaturation by NC71. Five molar monomer equivalents of NC71 are required to denature the tRNA in the absence of Mg2+. A Zn(II)-free, oxidized form of NC71 was also shown to unwind inactive tRNA with the same efficiency and stoichiometry. The detailed spectral changes which occur on NC-induced denaturation closely mimic temperature-induced denaturation of inactive tRNA(mixed). The prototype helix-destabilizing protein, T4 gene 32 protein, is unable to unwind this form of tRNA under the same conditions. The stoichiometry of unwinding of inactive tRNA by NC71 is consistent with the site size determined with poly(A). An active form of tRNA(mixed), prepared by thermal denaturation and refolding of the inactive form with Mg2+, proved less susceptible to both temperature and NC71-induced unwinding. The mechanistic implications of these findings on the reported biochemical activities of RNA:RNA annealing and replication primer tRNA positioning by NC are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1488362783,"gp120 is the envelope glycoprotein found on the surface of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), and it binds to human cell surface CD4 receptors to initiate the HIV-1 infection process. It is now well-established that synthetic peptides from the V3 region on gp120 elicit antibodies that block HIV-1 infection and HIV-1-mediated cell fusion. Here we show that synthetic peptides derived from similar V3 regions of several isolates of HIV-1 bind [3H]heparin, and we also demonstrate that [3H]heparin binds to recombinant gp120 IIIB. The binding could be blocked by unlabeled heparin, dextran sulfate, and by a highly anionic benzylated synthetic peptide derived from human CD4 (amino acids 81-92). The nonbenzylated peptides from the same region were considerably less active. Unlabeled heparin, dextran sulfate, and the CD4-derived peptides were able to compete with the binding of soluble gp120 to immobilized antibodies against fragments of the V3 from isolate IIIB, but they had no effect on the binding of gp120 to anti-peptide antibodies targeted against another unrelated region of gp120. Biotin conjugated to the benzylated CD4-peptide bound to gp120 and was blocked from this binding by anti-V3 antibodies. These results indicate that the three materials that have been demonstrated by others to block HIV-1 infection in vitro, sulfated polysaccharides, certain CD4-derived synthetic peptides, and anti-V3 antibodies, may be acting through a common mechanism that includes binding to the V3 region of gp120 on HIV-1."
https://openalex.org/W2045457678,"RNAs encoding a wild-type (RBK1) and a mutant (RBK1(Y379V,V381T); RBK1*) subunit of voltage-dependent potassium channels were injected into Xenopus oocytes. When expressed separately, they made homotetrameric channels that differed about 100-fold in sensitivity to tetraethylammonium (TEA). Mixtures of channels having one, two, or three low affinity subunits were expressed by injecting various proportions of RBK1 and RBK1* RNAs. The affinity for TEA of these three channel species was deduced by fitting concentration-response curves for the inhibition of potassium currents. DNAs were also concatenated to construct a sequence that encoded two connected subunits, and channels that contained four, two, or no TEA-sensitive subunits were expressed. The results suggest that bound TEA interacts simultaneously with all four subunits."

The 3' ends of U6 RNA's from various sources may be processed in different ways, or to different extents, depending on the organism or stage of development. The presence of a greater than p terminus on U6 RNA may influence the activity of U6 RNA either directly during splicing or indirectly by ensuring that the RNA has a defined length or proper conformation (or both)."
https://openalex.org/W2040585227,"The development of the neural retina follows a stereotyped time course that begins with an undifferentiated neuroepithelium populated by multipotential progenitor cells and ends with a highly differentiated tissue containing diverse cell types. The identities of the factors that guide this differentiation have remained elusive; a likely location for such factors, however, is the extracellular environment. Here, we show that the extracellular matrix component s-laminin is present in the neural retina, that s-laminin expression parallels the differentiation of rod photoreceptors, that photoreceptors interact with s-laminin in vitro, and that antibodies to s-laminin profoundly reduce the appearance of cells that express rhodopsin in vitro. These data suggest that s-laminin plays a role in the differentiation of the neural retina and provide evidence that the composition of the extracellular matrix may be an important determinant of retinal differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W1549150856,"Lipophosphoglycan (LPG) was isolated from the culture supernatant of Leishmania mexicana promastigotes and its structure elucidated by a combination of 1H NMR, fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry, methylation analysis, and chemical and enzymatic modifications. It consists of the repeating phosphorylated oligosaccharides PO4-6Gal beta 1-4Man alpha 1- and PO4-6[Glc beta 1-3]Gal beta 1-4Man alpha 1-, which are linked together in linear chains by phosphodiester linkages. Each chain of repeat units is linked to a phosphosaccharide core with the structure PO4-6Gal alpha 1-6Gal alpha 1-3Galf beta 1- 3[Glc alpha 1-PO4-6]Man alpha 1-3Man alpha 1-4GlcNH2 alpha 1-6 myo-inositol, where the myo-inositol residue forms the head group of a lyso-alkylphosphatidylinositol moiety. The nonreducing terminus of the repeat chains appear to be capped with the neutral oligosaccharides Man alpha 1-2Man, Man alpha 1-2Man alpha 1-2Man, or Man alpha 1-2[Gal beta 1-4]Man. Cellular LPG, isolated from promastigotes, has a very similar structure to the culture supernatant LPG. However, it differs from culture supernatant LPG in the average number of phosphorylated oligosaccharide repeat units (20 versus 28) and in alkyl chain composition. Although culture supernatant LPG contained predominantly C24:0 alkyl chains, cellular LPG contained approximately equal amounts of C24:0 and C26:0 alkyl chains. It is suggested that culture supernatant LPG is passively shed from promastigotes and that it may contribute significantly, but not exclusively, to the excreted factor used for serotyping Leishmania spp. Comparison of L. mexicana LPG with the LPGs of Leishmania major and Leishmania donovani indicate that these molecules are highly conserved but that species-specific differences occur in the phosphorylated oligosaccharide repeat branches and in the relative abundance of the neutral cap structures."
https://openalex.org/W1970000366,"Using a cDNA library prepared from circumvallate papillae of rat tongue, we have identified, cloned, and sequenced a novel K+ channel, designated cdrk. The cdrk channel appears to be a member of the Shab subfamily, most closely resembling drk1. Electrophysiologic analysis of expressed cdrk channels reveals delayed rectifier properties similar to those of drk1 channels. Localizations of cdrk mRNA in rat brain and peripheral tissues, assessed by in situ hybridization and Northern blot analysis, differ from any other reported K+ channels. In the brain cdrk mRNA is most concentrated in granule cells of the olfactory bulb and cerebellum. In peripheral tissues, mRNAs for cdrk and drk1 are reciprocally localized, indicating that the K+ channel properties contributed by mammalian Shab homologs may be important in a variety of excitable tissues."
https://openalex.org/W2029430014,"Electron microscopy and postembedding immunocytochemistry on rapidly frozen, freeze-substituted specimens of rat olfactory epithelia were used to study the subcellular localization of the transduction proteins Golf alpha and type III adenylyl cyclase. Antibody binding sites for both of these proteins occur in the same receptor cell compartments, the distal segments of the olfactory cilia. These segments line the boundary between organism and external environment inside the olfactory part of the nasal cavity. Therefore, they are the receptor cell regions that most likely first encounter odorous compounds. The results presented here provide direct evidence to support the conclusion that the distal segments of the cilia contain the sites of the early events of olfactory transduction."
https://openalex.org/W2092936514,"The pore of a chimeric K+ channel, CHM, differed from its parental host channel, Kv2.1, by 9 amino acids. Four were located in a putative deep region and 5 in a nearby outer mouth. Point reversions were without restorative effects, and reversions V3691 or L374V in the deep pore produced novel phenotypes. Among double mutations, only V3691 and L374V were effective in restoring the Kv2.1 pore phenotype. Adding a change in charge at Q382K in the outer pore fully restored the parental phenotype. Thus, the pore appears to have an inner, deep region where ions such as K+ and TEA+ may be regulated by nonpolar residues and an outer region where ions may be regulated by charged residues."
https://openalex.org/W1623183061,"Fluorescence resonance energy transfer has been used to study the aggregation and organization of pardaxin and its analogues within lipid membranes. Peptide molecules labeled with 5- (and 6-) carboxyfluorescein at their N-terminal amino acid served as donors in these energy transfer measurements, whereas peptides labeled with 5- (and 6-) carboxytetramethylrhodamine at either their N- or C-terminal amino acid, served as acceptors. The membrane-permeating activity of the native molecule was maintained in the labeled peptides. Upon aggregation of the labeled peptides, fluorescence energy transfer was detected as a quenching of the donor fluorescence (520 nm), as well as an enhancement of the acceptor fluorescence (575 nm). Correlation exists between self-aggregation of the different analogues within membranes and their poreforming abilities. A comparison of the degrees of fluorescence energy transfer from N1-donor-labeled pardaxin to N1-acceptor-labeled pardaxin with the transfer efficiency observed in the interaction between the same donor and C1-acceptor-labeled pardaxin suggests that aggregates are formed in an ordered manner, with a preferentially parallel orientation of monomers within the aggregate. The extent of hetero-oligomer formation, i.e. complexes composed of two different analogue species, revealed that complementary charges contribute to peptide-peptide recognition within the lipid bilayer. Taken together, these results provide further support for the barrel stave model, involving parallel organization of monomers within the aggregate, as a description of the pore formation mechanism of pardaxin and its analogues."
https://openalex.org/W1581592573,"Abstract Steady state kinetic analysis at pH 7.0 of the reduction of DL-glyceraldehyde by pig muscle aldose reductase showed that the enzyme follows a sequential ordered mechanism with NADPH binding first. However, the off for NADP+ in the forward direction was 1 order of magnitude less than the kcat. Analysis of this anomaly by pre-steady state kinetics using stopped-flow fluorescence spectroscopy showed that this could be accounted for by isomerization of the enzyme-NADP+ complex and that the rate of isomerization is the rate-limiting step. The rate constant for this step was of the same order of magnitude as the kcat for the forward reaction. Fluorescence emission spectra of free and NADP(H)-bound enzyme suggested a conformational change upon binding of coenzyme. In the reverse direction (oxidation of glycerol) pre-steady state and steady state kinetic analyses were consistent with the rate-limiting step occurring before isomerization of the enzyme-NADPH complex. We conclude, therefore, that during the kinetic mechanism of the reduction of aldehydes by aldose reductase, a slow (kinetically detectable) conformational change in the enzyme occurs upon coenzyme binding. Since NADPH and NADP+ bind to the enzyme very tightly, this has implications for the targeting and binding of drugs that are aldose reductase inhibitors."
https://openalex.org/W1602040371,"Aluminofluoride and beryllofluoride complexes can activate the heterotrimeric G-proteins by binding next to GDP in the nucleotide site of their G alpha subunit and acting as analogs of the gamma-phosphate of a GTP. However, the exact structures of the activatory complexes in solution as well as those of the bound complexes in the nucleotide site are still disputed. We have studied, by monitoring the activation-dependent tryptophan fluorescence of transducin T alpha subunit, the pF (-log[F-]) and pH dependencies of the kinetics of activation and deactivation of T alpha GDP in the presence of NaF and aluminum or beryllium salts. Comparisons were made with the calculated pF and pH dependencies of the distribution of the metallofluoride complexes, in order to identify the activating species. We observed that the contribution of a magnesium-dependent mechanism of activation by fluoride (Antonny, B., Bigay, J., and Chabre, M. (1990) FEBS Lett. 268, 277-280) and effects due to slow equilibration kinetics between various aluminofluoride complexes could give rise to puzzling kinetics that had caused misinterpretations of previous results. Once corrected for these effects, our results suggest that with aluminum AlF3(OH)- is, rather than AlF4-, the main activating species and that the bound form of the complex is tetracoordinated GDP-AlF3. Deactivation kinetics depend on the free fluoride concentration in the medium, suggesting that the simple bimolecular scheme: T alpha GDP-AlF3 in equilibrium with T alpha GDP+AlF3(OH) does not fully describe the interaction. Fluorides in the bound complexes can also exchange with free F- ions in solution. With beryllium, two complexes are activatory: BeF3-.H2O and BeF2(OH)-.H2O. In the nucleotide site these give two tetracoordinated complexes, GDP.BeF3 and GDP.BeF2(OH), as shown by their different dissociation rates."

https://openalex.org/W1503305141,"With the aim of preparing a light-stable rhodopsin-like pigment, an analog, II, of 11-cis retinal was synthesized in which isomerization of the C11-C12 cis-double bond is blocked by a cyclohexene ring built around the C10 to C13-methyl. The analog II formed a rhodopsin-like pigment (rhodopsin-II) with opsin expressed in COS-1 cells and with opsin from rod outer segments. The rate of rhodopsin-II formation from II and opsin was approximately 10 times slower than that of rhodopsin from 11-cis retinal and opsin. After solubilization in dodecyl maltoside and immunoaffinity purification, rhodopsin-II displayed an absorbance ratio (A280nm/A512nm) of 1.6, virtually identical with that of rhodopsin. Acid denaturation of rhodopsin-II formed a chromophore with lambda max, 452 nm, characteristic of protonated retinyl Schiff base. The ground state properties of rhodopsin-II were similar to those of rhodopsin in extinction coefficient (41,200 M-1 cm-1) and opsin-shift (2600 cm-1). Rhodopsin-II was stable to hydroxylamine in the dark, while light-dependent bleaching by hydroxylamine was slowed by approximately 2 orders of magnitude relative to rhodopsin. Illumination of rhodopsin-II for 10 s caused approximately 3 nm blue-shift and 3% loss of visible absorbance. Prolonged illumination caused a maximal blue-shift up to approximately 20 nm and approximately 40% loss of visible absorbance. An apparent photochemical steady state was reached after 12 min of illumination. Subsequent acid denaturation indicated that the retinyl Schiff base linkage was intact. A red-shift (approximately 12 nm) in lambda max and a 45% recovery of visible absorbance was observed after returning the 12-min illuminated pigment to darkness. Rhodopsin-II showed marginal light-dependent transducin activation and phosphorylation by rhodopsin kinase."
https://openalex.org/W1540859569,"One of the least understood steps in the UvrABC mediated excision repair process is the recognition of lesions in the DNA. The isolation of different reaction intermediates is of vital importance for the unraveling of the mechanism. A mobility shift gel electrophoresis assay is described which visualizes such intermediates. After incubation of a DNA substrate containing a specific cisplatin adduct with UvrA alone or with UvrA and UvrB, UvrA.DNA, UvrAB.DNA and UvrB.DNA complexes were observed which could be identified using specific antibodies. At low UvrA concentrations in the presence of UvrB only the UvrB.DNA complex is observed. Bands corresponding to the UvrAB.DNA complex and also other nonspecific bands are found at relatively high UvrA concentrations. The DNase-I footprint for the UvrAB.- and UvrB.DNA complex are very similar and protect about 20 bases. Both complexes are incised in the presence of UvrC with comparable efficiency. The UvrAB.- and the UvrB.DNA complex were both incised at the 8th phosphodiester bond 5‘ to a specific cisplatin adduct. In addition the UvrAB.DNA complex could also be incised at the 15th phosphodiesterbond 5‘ to the damaged site. The results suggest that the UvrB.DNA complex is the natural substrate for UvrC-induced incision."
https://openalex.org/W2075028923,"We report that two novel alternatively spliced products of the murine Oct-2 gene encode Mini-Oct (Oct-2d), a protein consisting of almost only the POU domain, and Oct-2c, a protein lacking the last 12 amino acids of Oct-2a. Ectopic expression in HeLa cells shows that Oct-2c is a transactivator, whereas Mini-Oct fails to transactivate if the octamer motif is in a promoter position next to TATA box. Mini-Oct can repress the transcriptional signal generated by endogenous octamer factors in F9 cells. It seems that Mini-Oct has the potential to serve as a transcriptional modulator for genes regulated by different octamer-binding factors. In situ hybridization reveals that Mini-Oct expression follows the general pattern of other known Oct-2 transcripts. However, it is absent from the Purkinje cell layer in the cerebellum of adult mice, and strong expression is observed in the developing nasal neuroepithelium and primary spermatids. Differential expression patterns of the Oct-2 transcripts with different transactivation/repression capacities of the encoded proteins may have a specific role in gene expression in the developing nervous system and in adult brain."
https://openalex.org/W1561462768,"The primary structure of the major surface glycoconjugate of Leishmania donovani parasites, a lipophosphoglycan, has been further characterized. The repeating PO4-6Galp beta 1-4Man disaccharide units, which are a salient feature of the molecule, are shown to terminate with one of several neutral structures, the most abundant of which is the branched trisaccharide Galp beta 1-4(Manp alpha 1-2)Man. The phosphosaccharide core of lipophosphoglycan, which links the disaccharide repeats to a lipid anchor, contains 2 phosphate residues. One of the core phosphates has previously been localized on O-6 of the galactosyl residue distal to the lipid anchor; the second phosphate is now shown to be on O-6 of the mannosyl residue distal to the anchor and to bear an alpha-linked glucopyranosyl residue. Also, the anomeric configuration of the unusual 3-substituted Galf residue in the phosphosaccharide core is established as beta. The complete structure of the core is thus PO4-6Galp alpha 1-6Galp alpha 1-3Galf beta 1-3[Glcp alpha 1-PO4-6]Manp alpha 1-3Manp alpha 1-4GlcN alpha 1-. This further clarification of the structure of lipophosphoglycan may prove beneficial in determining the structure-function relationships of this highly unusual glycoconjugate."
https://openalex.org/W1528638641,"Swarm rat chondrosarcoma cell cultures were metabolically labeled with [35S]sulfate, [3H]glucose, or [3H]glucosamine. Chondroitin sulfate chains were isolated from purified aggrecan using alkaline borohydride treatment and Superose 6 chromatography. Various linkage region oligosaccharide alditols were derived from these chains using sequential chondroitinase digestions (ABC lyase followed by ACII lyase). They were then further processed by mercuric acetate treatment, which removed the 4,5-unsaturated uronosyl residue from the nonreducing end of the linkage, and then beta-galactosidase digestion which liberated the 2 galactose residues from the xylitol reducing terminus. Alkaline phosphatase digestions were performed to verify the presence of phosphate esters. All linkage region structures were isolated and identified using a combination of Progel-TSK G2500 and CarboPac PA1 chromatography steps in conjunction with monosaccharide analyses. This study revealed that chondroitin sulfate chains from aggrecan synthesized by rat chondrosarcoma cells in vitro have the following properties: 1) three out of every four of their linkage regions carry a phosphate ester on xylose, 2) nearly three out of every five chains begin the repeating disaccharide region with an unsulfated first disaccharide unit, 3) nearly twice as many nonphosphorylated chains have a sulfated first disaccharide than their phosphorylated counterparts, and 4) the vast majority of these chains do not contain sulfated galactose in their linkage regions. This report also describes a borohydride reduction procedure to confer alkali stability to the 3-substituted, unsaturated disaccharides derived from chondroitinase digests of chondroitin sulfate. Furthermore, a CarboPac PA1 method is demonstrated that separates these reduced disaccharides with exceptional resolution."
https://openalex.org/W1517205234,"The lipid mediator platelet-activating factor (1-O-alkyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine, AGEPC) has been shown to elicit several important biochemical signaling responses in mammalian cells, including polyphosphoinositide hydrolysis, arachidonic acid release/eicosanoid production, and protein tyrosine phosphorylation. In the present study, the roles of Ca2+ and protein kinase C (PKC), two signaling components of the phospholipase C pathway, in AGEPC-stimulated eicosanoid production and protein tyrosine phosphorylation, were investigated in cultured rat Kupffer cells. AGEPC at nanomolar concentrations induced an increase in intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i), stimulated membrane PKC activity, and resulted in protein tyrosine phosphorylation. The maximal increase in [Ca2+]i and membrane PKC activity in response to AGEPC were observed within 30-50 s, whereas the AGEPC-induced protein tyrosine phosphorylation reached maximal levels within 2-5 min. [Ethylenebis(oxyethylenenitrilo)]tetraacetic acid (EGTA) but not 8-(N,N-diethylamino)-octyl-3,4,5-trimethoxybenzoate hydrochloride (TMB-8), an inhibitor of calcium release from intracellular compartments, nearly abolished the AGEPC-induced increase in [Ca2+]i suggesting involvement of extracellular calcium influx in this event. Both EGTA and TMB-8 abolished or inhibited AGEPC-stimulated protein tyrosine phosphorylation and eicosanoid formation, respectively. The calcium ionophore A23187 alone stimulated eicosanoid production and protein tyrosine phosphorylation with an identical pattern to that of AGEPC. Phorbol myristate acetate (PMA), an activator of PKC, which did not affect [Ca2+]i, mimicked the actions of AGEPC, stimulating eicosanoid production and promoting tyrosine phosphorylation of a set of proteins similar to those phosphorylated following AGEPC stimulation. AGEPC-enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation of some of the protein substrates and eicosanoid production were inhibited in cells down-regulated for PKC. Furthermore, both PMA- and AGEPC-stimulated eicosanoid production and protein tyrosine phosphorylation were attenuated or abolished by at least one of the PKC inhibitors, staurosporine, and calphostin C. Taken together, these results are consistent with the conclusions that: (a) AGEPC stimulates the phospholipase-mediated arachidonic acid release/eicosanoid synthesis cascade and protein tyrosine phosphorylation through extracellular Ca(2+)-dependent and PKC-dependent and -independent mechanism(s) and (b) the Ca(2+)-PKC interaction determines the efficacy of the AGEPC-stimulated cellular events."
https://openalex.org/W1571189729,"alpha-L-Iduronidase is a lysosomal enzyme, the deficiency of which causes mucopolysaccharidosis I (MPS I); a canine MPS I colony has been bred to test therapeutic intervention. The enzyme was purified to apparent homogeneity from canine testis and found to consist of two electrophoretically separable proteins that had common internal peptides but differed at their amino termini. A 57-base oligonucleotide, corresponding to the most probable codons of the longest peptide, was used to screen a canine testis cDNA library. Three cDNAs were isolated, two of which lacked the 5'-end whereas the third was full-length except for a small internal deletion. The composite sequence encodes an open reading frame of 655 amino acids that includes all sequenced peptides. The amino terminus of the larger protein, glutamic acid 26, is at the predicted signal peptide cleavage site, whereas the amino terminus of the smaller protein is leucine 106. There are six potential N-glycosylation sites and a non-canonical polyadenylation signal, CTTAAA. A search of GenBank showed that the amino acid sequence of alpha-L-iduronidase has similarity to that of a bacterial beta-xylosidase. A full-length cDNA corresponding to the composite sequence was constructed (pcIdu) and inserted into the pSVL expression vector (pSVcIdu). Two days after Cos-1 cells were transfected with pSVcIdu, their intracellular and secreted level of alpha-L-iduronidase activity has increased 8- and 22-fold, respectively, over the endogenous activity. Fibroblasts of MPS I dogs, which have no alpha-L-iduronidase activity, lacked the normal alpha-L-iduronidase mRNA of 2.2 kilobases and contained instead a trace amount of a 2.8-kilobase species. Isolation and characterization of an expressible alpha-L-iduronidase cDNA represents the first step toward mutation analysis and replacement therapy."
https://openalex.org/W1657627128,"The major DNA adduct (greater than 95% total) resulting from the bioactivation of ethylene dibromide by conjugation with GSH is S-(2-(N7-guanyl)ethyl)GSH. The mutagenic potential of this adduct has been uncertain, however, because the observed mutagenicity might be caused by other adducts present at much lower levels, e.g. S-(2-N1-adenyl)ethyl)GSH. To assess the formation of other potential adducts, S-(2-(N3-deoxycytidyl)ethyl)GSH, S-(2-(O6-deoxyguanosyl)ethyl)GSH, and S-(2-(N2-deoxyguanosyl)ethyl)GSH were prepared and used as standards in the analysis of calf thymus DNA modified by treatment with [1,2-14C]ethylene dibromide and GSH in the presence of rat liver cytosol; only minor amounts (less than 0.2%) were found. A forward mutation assay in (repair-deficient) Salmonella typhimurium TA100 and sequence analysis were utilized to determine the type, site, and frequency of mutations in a portion of the lacZ gene resulting from in vitro modification of bacteriophage M13mp18 DNA with S-(2-chloroethyl)GSH, an analog of the ethylene dibromide-GSH conjugate. An adduct level of approximately 8 nmol (mg DNA)-1 resulted in a 10-fold increase in mutation frequency relative to the spontaneous level. The spectrum of spontaneous mutations was quite varied, but the spectrum of S-(2-chloroethyl)GSH-induced mutations consisted primarily of base substitutions of which G:C to A:T transitions accounted for 75% (70% of the total mutations). All available evidence implicates S-(2-(N7-guanyl)ethyl)GSH as the cause of these mutations inasmuch as the levels of the minor adducts are not consistent with the mutation frequency observed in this system. The sequence selectivity of alkylation was determined by treatment of end-labeled lac DNA fragments with S-(2-chloroethyl)GSH, cleavage of the DNA at adduct sites, and electrophoretic analysis. Comparison of the sequence selectivity with the mutation spectrum revealed no obligate relationship between the extent of adduct formation and the number of mutations which resulted at different sites. We suggest that the mechanism of mutagenesis involves DNA sequence-dependent alterations in the interaction of the polymerase with the (modified) template and incoming nucleotide."

By sequence comparison, the protein was found to be a member of the serpin family with strong identity to plasminogen activator inhibitor-2. In contrast to other serpins this protein contained no carbohydrate and had a blocked amino terminus. Preliminary evidence indicates that the inhibitor has the additional feature of being a thymosin beta 4-binding protein, since this polypeptide was always located in purified preparations of the protein. This suggests a physiological role for cytoplasmic elastase inhibitors in the thymosin beta 4-regulated rearrangement of the cytoskeleton of leukocytes."

https://openalex.org/W1506535479,"Human glycoasparaginase (N4-(beta-N-acetyl-D-glucosaminyl)-L-asparaginase, EC 3.5.1.26) hydrolyzes a series of compounds that contain L-asparagine residue with free alpha-amino and alpha-carboxyl groups. Substrates include high mannose and complex type glycoasparagines as well as those that lack the di-N-acetylchitobiose moiety, L-aspartic acid beta-methyl ester and L-aspartic acid beta-hydroxamate. The enzyme is inactive toward L-asparagine and L-glutamine and glycoasparagines containing substituted alpha-amino and/or alpha-carboxyl groups. In the presence of the acyl acceptor hydroxylamine, glycoasparaginase catalyzes the synthesis of L-aspartic acid beta-hydroxamate from aspartyl-glucosamine, L-aspartic acid beta-methyl ester, and L-aspartic acid. 13C NMR studies using 18O-labeled L-aspartic acid demonstrate that glycoasparaginase catalyzes an oxygen exchange between water and the carboxyl group at C-4 of L-aspartic acid. These results indicate that glycoasparaginase reacts as an exo-hydrolase toward the L-asparagine moiety of the substrates and the free alpha-amino and alpha-carboxyl groups are required for the enzyme reaction. The results are consistent with an L-asparaginase-like reaction pathway which involves a beta-aspartyl enzyme intermediate. Since glycoasparaginase is active toward a series of structurally different glycoasparagines, we suggest the revised systematic name of N4-(beta-glycosyl)-L-asparaginase for the enzyme."

Heretofore, engineered alterations of the enzyme have only decreased the selectivity for CO2 utilization. We show that alanyl replacement of active-site Ser-368 of the Rhodospirillum rubrum carboxylase enhances the carboxylation selectivity approximately 1.6-fold over the wild-type level. This enhancement reflects a greater relative decline in oxygenase efficiency than in carboxylase efficiency. In contrast to wild-type enzyme, the carboxylase activity of the Ser-368 mutant protein is not perceptibly inhibited by O2, perhaps indicative of a change in rate-limiting steps in the overall reaction pathway."

Two 8-bp inverted repeats surround the central residue of the 7-bp overlap sequence; this central residue is the second residue of the anticodon sequence of the H. influenzae tRNA(leu)(UUR) gene which contains attB, and this symmetric segment encodes the anticodon stem and loop."
https://openalex.org/W1540253039,"A human genomic library was screened with the pig thymus cDNA coding for chromosomal protein HMG2. A 4341-base pair fragment containing the entire gene encoding this protein was isolated and characterized. The HMG2 gene is 2665 base pairs long from the start site to the end of transcription and comprises 5 exons. The size of mRNA postulated from the exons is 1125 base pairs long, consistent with that obtained by Northern hybridization analysis. The canonical 5'-regulatory motifs, CCAAT, are present, while the TATA element is absent from the gene. Southern analysis suggested that HMG2 protein is encoded by a single or only a few genes of high homology. The primary structure of the human HMG2 protein consists of 208 amino acid residues, deduced from the coding region of the gene, is different from that of pig HMG2 in only two amino acids; one is exchanged and the other is missing. The amino acid sequences of two DNA binding domains, HMG-box, also recently found in several transcription factors, are completely homologous in human and pig HMG2. The present study, which is the first one on the isolation and characterization of complete gene coding for HMG2 protein, may be useful for evolutional and genomic analysis of the proteins containing the HMG-box sequences for DNA binding."
https://openalex.org/W1590495238,"Alignment of prokaryotic and vertebrate type II thymidine kinases (TK) (EC 2.7.1.21), such as that encoded by vaccinia virus (VVTK), reveals three conserved regions: designated domains I, III, and VII. Domains I and III of VVTK contain residues which closely resemble segments A (ATP) and B (Mg2+), respectively, of a Mg.ATP binding descriptor proposed previously (Walker, J.E., Saraster, M., Runswick, M-J., and Gay, N.J. (1982) EMBO J. 1, 945-951). In support of this hypothesis, domain I of the VVTK enzyme has previously been identified as the ATP binding site (Black and Hruby, 1990b). With regard to Mg2+ binding, several features of the VVTK domain III suggest that it may be responsible for this activity: 1) sequence similarity to a magnesium binding motif proposed previously (Walker, J.E., Saraster, M., Runswick, M-J., and Gay, N.J. (1982) EMBO J. 1, 945-951); 2) alignment of the predicted secondary structure of type II TK enzymes with other magnesium-binding enzymes such as adenylate kinase, EF-TU, and p21 reveals a conserved aspartic acid residue preceded by several hydrophobic residues with domain III; and 3) the conserved VVTK domain III aspartic acid residue (D82) aligns with D93 residue of adenylate kinase which is has been shown by NMR to participate in Mg2+ binding (Yan, H., and Tsai, M.-D., Biochemistry, in press). To directly examine the potential contribution of the conserved domain III D82 residue of VVTK in magnesium binding, site-directed mutagenesis was performed on positions D82 and G84 to generate four mutants, N82, L82, I82, and V84. Each mutant was analyzed for enzyme activity, divalent cation requirements, tetramer formation, and ATP binding ability. The results obtained were consistent with D82 playing a direct role in Mg2+ binding and suggest that while the aspartic acid does not appear to participate directly with ATP binding it may instead act to facilitate ATP hydrolysis by binding Mg2+ which aids to correctly position ATP for nucleophilic attack."
https://openalex.org/W1510381043,"Biosynthetic labeling of cellular lipids with a fluorescent pyrenyl fatty acid (PyrxFA) moiety was studied in order to assess the usefulness of this approach in the introduction of fluorescent lipid molecules to living cells for transport and metabolic studies. PyrxFAs containing 4-14 aliphatic carbons were added to the culture medium of baby hamster kidney (BHK) fibroblasts, and their incorporation to various lipid species was monitored by thin layer and high pressure liquid chromatography. The results show that the length of the acyl chain has a remarkable effect on the efficiency of incorporation as well as distribution of the label between lipid species. Accordingly, PyrxFAs can be divided into two groups: the short chain ones including the pyrene butyrate and hexanoate derivatives, which show only modest incorporation to phospholipids and negligible labeling of triglycerides and cholesterol esters, and the long chain PyrxFAs including pyrene octanoate, decanoate, dodecanoate, and myristate derivatives, which incorporate efficiently both to phospholipids, mainly phosphatidylcholine (PC) and -ethanolamine (PE), and neutral lipids, i.e. di- and triglycerides and cholesterol esters. Positional analysis showed that the longer PyrxFAs are esterified preferentially to the sn-1 position of the glycerol moiety of PC and PE while the shorter ones are found exclusively in the sn-2 position indicating that the longer PyrxFAs mimic natural saturated fatty acids whereas the shorter ones may be recognized as polyunsaturated fatty acids by the acylating enzymes. Reverse phase chromatography of PC and PE revealed the presence of a variety of labeled molecular species among which the palmitate and oleate containing species were the major ones. Reverse phase analysis with simultaneous monitoring at the monomer and excimer channels showed the presence of tri- and diglyceride species with either 1 or 2 pyrenyl acyl residues. Analysis of the total cellular fatty acids demonstrated that PyrxFAs are shortened, probably by beta-oxidation in peroxisomes, up to pyrene butyrate. It is concluded that metabolic labeling with PyrxFAs is a promising alternative for studies on intracellular lipid traffic, especially because it allows introduction of fluorescent phospholipid species of very different hydrophobicity into intracellular membrane(s)."
https://openalex.org/W1972884856,"In leech, the central projections of peripheral sensory neurons segregate into specific axonal tracts, which are distinguished by differential expression of surface antigens recognized by the monoclonal antibodies Lan3-2 and Lan4-2. Lan3-2 recognizes an epitope expressed on axons that segregate into three distinct axon fascicles. In contrast, the Lan4-2-positive axons selectively project into only one of the Lan3-2-positive axon tracts. These observations provide evidence for a hierarchy of guidance cues mediating specific pathway formation in this system. Since the Lan3-2 antibody has been shown to perturb this process and since, as shown here, the Lan3-2 and Lan4-2 antigens are closely molecularly interrelated, these antibodies may help define molecules and epitopes mediating neuronal recognition and axonal guidance."
https://openalex.org/W1589217408,"This report examines the effect of hypotonic stress on ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) activity and ODC mRNA concentrations in LLC-PK1 cells. Earle's balanced salts solution minus glucose (EBSS-G) with decreasing concentrations of NaCl was utilized as the ODC induction medium. Hypotonic EBSS-G increased both the concentration of ODC mRNA and the specific activity of ODC in LLC-PK1 cells. Actinomycin D and cycloheximide prevented the increase in enzyme activity resulting from hypotonic stress. Actinomycin D was also a potent inhibitor of ODC mRNA expression resulting from hypotonic stress. Cycloheximide had very little effect on the induction of ODC mRNA in cells incubated in hypotonic EBSS-G. The magnitude of the increase in both ODC mRNA concentrations and enzyme activity was dependent on the incubation time in hypotonic media. The increase in ODC mRNA concentrations preceded the elevation in enzyme activity. ODC mRNA concentrations and the specific activity of ODC increased as a function of decreasing media osmolarity. The addition of putrescine, spermidine, and spermine to EBSS-G containing reduced NaCl suppressed the increase in LLC-PK1 ODC activity related to hypotonic stress. In contrast, these polyamines did not prevent the increase in ODC mRNA resulting from hypotonic shock. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that hypotonic stress increases ODC mRNA levels and enzyme activity in four additional cell lines from two different species. Based on these results it is suggested that one or more signal transducers associated with cell volume expansion enhance expression of the ODC gene."
https://openalex.org/W1544593271,"Abstract Although truncation of the hydrophilic C-terminal tail of the lactose (lac) permease of Escherichia coli (residues 401-417) has no significant effect on membrane insertion, stability, or transport activity, sequential substitution of stop codons for amino acid codons 398-401 leads to a progressive increase in transport activity and in the lifetime of the permease in the membrane (McKenna, E., Hardy, D., Pastore, J. C., and Kaback, H. R. (1991) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 88, 2969-2973). Thus, either the last turn of putative helix XII or the region immediately distal to helix XII is important for proper folding, and hence, activity and resistance to proteolysis. In an effort to determine whether this 3-4-amino acid sequence comprises the final turn of the last transmembrane helix of the permease or the beginning of the hydrophilic C-terminal tail, we deleted residues 401-417 and replaced amino acid residues 397-400 with either 4 Leu residues (helix making) or Gly-Pro-Gly-Pro (helix breaking). Permease with 4 Leu residues at positions 397-400 is fully functional with respect to transport and completely stable, as judged by [35S]methionine labeling experiments. In marked contrast, permease with Gly-Pro-Gly-Pro at the same positions exhibits minimal activity and is unstable. The results imply that the amino acid sequence ... Val397Phe398Thr399 Leu400 ... in lac permease may comprise the last turn of transmembrane helix XII, rather than the beginning of the C-terminal tail."
https://openalex.org/W1546952495,"For unliganded neurophysin, the effects of reduction of a single disulfide and limited regeneration of activity following reduction have suggested metastable disulfide pairing relative to that of the neurophysin precursor. This metastability was confirmed in the present study by the demonstration of almost complete regeneration of activity from the reduced state in the presence of ligand peptides, conditions mimicking precursor folding. To assign the source of the metastability of the unliganded mature protein, the disulfide(s) most susceptible to reduction and the last to be reoxidized following complete reduction were identified. Partial reduction of the first disulfide followed by trapping of the generated thiols with [14C]iodoacetate gave a distribution of label consistent with identification of the unstable disulfide as the 10-54 bridge and rapid interchange of the Cys-10 thiol with other disulfides in the amino-terminal disulfide domain. The same thiol distribution was seen at the terminal stage of reoxidation following complete reduction, providing evidence that unfolding and folding pathways are the same at this stage. The results indicate that, in the absence of bound peptide, the state with correct pairing of the 10-54 bridge has no significant thermodynamic advantage over interchanged states of the amino-terminal domain. However, since the 10-54 bridge is located at the peptide-binding site, the correct pairing is directly stabilized by ligand peptides. Moreover, since the other three bridges of the amino domain are homologous to bridges in the carboxyl-terminal domain that do not appear to be unstable, the results allow the possibility that the 10-54 bridge, which is unique to the amino domain, destabilizes other disulfides in that domain."
https://openalex.org/W1481794268,"With the aim of preparing a light-insensitive bacteriorhodopsin-like pigment, bacterio-opsin expressed in Escherichia coli was treated in phospholipid-detergent micelles with the retinal analog II, in which the C13-C14 trans-double bond cannot isomerize due to inclusion in a cyclopentene ring. The formation of a complex with a fine structure (lambda max, 439 nm) was first observed. This partially converted over a period of 12 days to a bacteriorhodopsin-like chromophore (ebR-II) with lambda max, 555 nm. An identical behavior has been observed previously upon reconstitution of bleached purple membrane with the analog II. Purification by gel filtration gave pure ebR-II with lambda max, 558 nm, similar to that of light-adapted bacterio-opsin reconstituted with all-trans retinal (ebR-I). Spectrophotometric titration of ebR-II as a function of pH showed that the purple to blue transition of bacteriorhodopsin at acidic pH was altered, and the apparent pKa of Schiff base deprotonation at alkaline pH was lowered by 2.4 units, relative to that of ebR-I. ebR-II showed no light-dark adaptation, no proton pumping, and no intermediates characteristic of the bacteriorhodopsin photocycle. In addition, the rates of reaction with hydroxylamine in the dark and in the light were similar. These results show, as expected, that isomerization of the C13-C14 double bond is required for bacteriorhodopsin function and that prevention of this isomerization confers light insensitivity."
https://openalex.org/W1527500190,"Studies are described examining further the decline in folate analogue influx mediated by the one-carbon reduced-folate transport system in HL-60 cells following induction of maturation by cytodifferentiation agents. To facilitate the investigation of the underlying basis of this phenomenon, we derived a variant (HL-60/LCV) with 4-5-fold elevated influx capacity (Vmax) for folate analogues. A commensurate increase in the putative transporter for this system was documented by affinity labeling of these cells with N-hydroxysuccinimide-[3H]aminopterin. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the affinity labeled plasma membrane in HL-60/LCV cells delineated a protein peak at Mr = 75,000-80,000. This was substantially greater than the analogous transporter (Mr = 45,000-47,000) we had delineated (Yang, C.-H., Sirotnak, F.M., and Mines, L.S. (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 9703-9709) with the same methodology in the L1210 cell plasma membrane. In addition, the rate of translocation of the Mr = 75,000-80,000 transporter in HL-60 and HL-60/LCV cells was 2-fold lower than the rate of translocation determined for the Mr = 45,000-47,000 transporter in L1210 cells. During induced maturation of HL-60/LCV cells toward the granulocyte pathway, [3H]methotrexate (MTX) influx capacity and the amount of the affinity labeled transporter decreased rapidly in a parallel fashion. The decrease in [3H]MTX influx and in affinity labeling and in the amount of the Mr = 75,000-80,000 transporter was 5-fold following exposure to 210 mM dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO) for 5 days during growth in culture. Moreover, during cycloheximide treatment, the decay in [3H]MTX influx at 37 degrees C and in amount of affinity labeled transporter was the same (t1/2 = 144-155 min) for both control and Me2SO-treated HL-60/LCV cells. These results, which reveal no difference in metabolic turnover for control and Me2SO-treated cells, suggest that the decline in folate analogue influx in HL-60/LCV influx cells is a very early event in the program of differentiation and probably occurs by down-regulation of synthesis of the transporter for the one-carbon reduced-folate transport system."
