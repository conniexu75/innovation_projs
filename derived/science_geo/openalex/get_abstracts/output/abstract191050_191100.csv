https://openalex.org/W74893650,"The present paper describes the main characteristics of natural enteramine as well as a procedure for its isolation. In another paper the preparation and the characteristics of synthetic enteramine have been considered (1). Vertebrates and some groups of invertebrates possess a particular system of cells, known as the enterochromafin cell system, which contains specific granules characterized by several well defined and distinctive chemical and physicochemical features (chromaffinity, argentaffinity, fluorescence in Wood’s light, ability to couple with diazonium salts, and fixation by formolcontaining histological fixatives). The cells of this system may be distributed within the gastrointestinal mucosa (2-4) or skin (or both) (5) or else massed in well defined glandular formations (6-9). The specific secretion or storage product of the enterochromaffin system has been termed enteramine (10, 11). A number of color tests and biological reactions suitable for the detection and quantitative determination of this substance have been described (12-14). The pharmacological effects exerted by enteramine are (a) a powerful stimulating action on the estrous uterus and the duodenum of the rat, the small intestine of the rabbit, the urinary bladder of the dog, both isolated and in situ, and the heart of mollusks (15) ; (b) a moderate action on the systemic blood pressure, which may be hypotensive, hypertensive, or biphasic, according to the animal species, the dose, and the state of the circulatory system (16) ; (c) an intense antidiuretic action, especially evident in hydrated rats. Diuresis may be reduced in these animals even after a subcutaneous injection of as little as 5 y of enteramine per kilo of body weight. This dose is at least 50 to 100 times smaller than that needed to affect the systemic blood pressure and at least 10,000 times smaller than the median lethal dose by the subcutaneous route. Furthermore, enteramine acts selectively on the contractile structures of the afferent vascular bed of the glomerulus, causing an increase in tonus, or spasm (17). With high single doses or with repeated doses, the vascular spasm leads to a severe and lasting ischemia, resulting in more or less extensive degeneration and necrosis of large sections of the cortex of the kidney.’"

https://openalex.org/W1598810593,"During the course of a study of the structural requirements for oxidation of fatty acids by mitochondria of rat tissue, it was found that systems forti fied for optimal fatty acid oxidation readily oxidized long and short chain aldehydes. In view of the findings by Stadtman and Barker (1) that acetaldehyde oxidation by Clostridium lcluyveri results in the formation of acetyl phosphate, the possibility was envisioned that oxidation of an aldehyde by mitochondria of animal tissues might lead to an active fatty acid derivative, and this process was studied in the hope that information might thus be secured on the mechanism of fatty acid activation. Although this hope was not realized, it was felt that the data obtained are of sufficient interest to warrant publication."

https://openalex.org/W161555313,"The methods described two decades ago (l-3) for the isolation of crystalline stercobilin or urobilin from feces or urine are relatively slow and cumbersome. It is often desirable to obtain a few mg of crystalline material quickly, either to permit determination of the preponderant type (whether stercobilin, urobilin, or d-urobilin) or calibration of a quantitative method. More recently, the studies of Shemin and associates (4-S), based on the essential nature of glycine and acetate in the biosynthesis of the heme pigments, have made it highly desirable to have at hand a simple method permitting rapid and repeated isolation of stercobilin from feces in order that serial observations of N16 content may be made, following administration of N16-glycine. Of special interest in this connection is the question of exact significance of the early appearance of N15 in the stercobilin molecule, a finding indicating that a certain fraction, varying under normal and pathological conditions, has a derivation other than the hemoglobin of red blood cells which have survived a normal life span (6, 7). Since determinations of the atom per cent excess of N15 in the mass spectrometer require but 10 mg. of pure substance, the method to be described in the following is particularly adapted to studies of this type. This method depends in considerable part on the dehydrogenation of stercobilinogen or urobilinogen with iodine, in petroleum ether solutions, as described in the preceding paper (9). It may be noted that Lichtenstein and Terwen, in 1925 (lo), used petroleum ether to extract a urobilinogen from an aqueous filtrate of a feces-ferrous hydroxide mixture. The petroleum ether was then allowed to stand in the light, with resultant formation and precipitation of an amorphous urobilin. The latter was not crystallized, but was evidently relatively pure. It probably consisted in the main of the levorotatory stercobilin. We have, in fact, been able to isolate crystalline sterco-"

https://openalex.org/W129718589,"The metabolism of cholesterol in the chick embryo has been investigated by means of balance experiments and by the use of deuterium oxide as an indicator. The majority of balance experiments suggested a net synthesis (l), but Dam (2) concluded after careful experimentation that this had not been established. Similar investigations in this laboratory with 52 eggs confirm this conclusion. Rittenberg and Schoenheimer (3) were unable to demonstrate the incorporation of deuterium into the cholesterol of fertile eggs incubated in the presence of added deuterium oxide. However, the results of Bernhard (4) indicated a significant deuterium content in the cholesterol of the embryo. Our early experiments with eggs incubated for 14 days with injected carboxyl-labeled sodium acetate support Bernhard’s results. The work reported here was undertaken to obtain information concerning the continuity, site and time of synthesis, and possibly the rate of degradation."
