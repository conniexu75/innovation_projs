https://openalex.org/W2146634980,"The Centre for the AIDS Program of Research in South Africa (CAPRISA) 004 trial assessed the effectiveness and safety of a 1% vaginal gel formulation of tenofovir, a nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitor, for the prevention of HIV acquisition in women. A double-blind, randomized controlled trial was conducted comparing tenofovir gel (n = 445 women) with placebo gel (n = 444 women) in sexually active, HIV-uninfected 18- to 40-year-old women in urban and rural KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. HIV serostatus, safety, sexual behavior, and gel and condom use were assessed at monthly follow-up visits for 30 months. HIV incidence in the tenofovir gel arm was 5.6 per 100 women-years (person time of study observation) (38 out of 680.6 women-years) compared with 9.1 per 100 women-years (60 out of 660.7 women-years) in the placebo gel arm (incidence rate ratio = 0.61; P = 0.017). In high adherers (gel adherence > 80%), HIV incidence was 54% lower (P = 0.025) in the tenofovir gel arm. In intermediate adherers (gel adherence 50 to 80%) and low adherers (gel adherence < 50%), the HIV incidence reduction was 38 and 28%, respectively. Tenofovir gel reduced HIV acquisition by an estimated 39% overall, and by 54% in women with high gel adherence. No increase in the overall adverse event rates was observed. There were no changes in viral load and no tenofovir resistance in HIV seroconverters. Tenofovir gel could potentially fill an important HIV prevention gap, especially for women unable to successfully negotiate mutual monogamy or condom use."
https://openalex.org/W2102560467,"Somatic cell nuclear transfer and transcription-factor-based reprogramming revert adult cells to an embryonic state, and yield pluripotent stem cells that can generate all tissues. Through different mechanisms and kinetics, these two reprogramming methods reset genomic methylation, an epigenetic modification of DNA that influences gene expression, leading us to hypothesize that the resulting pluripotent stem cells might have different properties. Here we observe that low-passage induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) derived by factor-based reprogramming of adult murine tissues harbour residual DNA methylation signatures characteristic of their somatic tissue of origin, which favours their differentiation along lineages related to the donor cell, while restricting alternative cell fates. Such an ‘epigenetic memory’ of the donor tissue could be reset by differentiation and serial reprogramming, or by treatment of iPSCs with chromatin-modifying drugs. In contrast, the differentiation and methylation of nuclear-transfer-derived pluripotent stem cells were more similar to classical embryonic stem cells than were iPSCs. Our data indicate that nuclear transfer is more effective at establishing the ground state of pluripotency than factor-based reprogramming, which can leave an epigenetic memory of the tissue of origin that may influence efforts at directed differentiation for applications in disease modelling or treatment. Induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells are produced by reprogramming differentiated adult cells using a cocktail of transcription factors. They share many properties that are characteristic of embryonic stem (ES) cells generated by somatic-cell nuclear transfer (SCNT), and of ES cells from naturally fertilized embryos. The three cell types are not identical, however, and an interesting difference has now been discovered: iPS cells retain an 'epigenetic memory' of the donor tissue from which they derive, whereas SCNT-based reprogramming resets the DNA-methylation state of adult cells so it is closer to the ES cell-like state. In a separate study, Ji et al. examine the role of specific DNA methylation marks in the developmental progression of particular cell lineages. They present a genome-wide DNA-methylation analysis of haematopoietic cell populations that reveals remarkable epigenetic plasticity. Changes in DNA methylation emerge as perhaps a principal factor directing cell-fate choices such as commitment to myeloid or lymphoid development. Pluripotent stem cells can be generated in the laboratory through somatic cell nuclear transfer (generating nuclear transfer embryonic stem cells, ntESCs) or transcription-factor-based reprogramming (producing induced pluripotent stem cells, iPSCs). These methods reset the methylation signature of the genome — but to what extent? Here it is found that mouse iPSCs 'remember' the methylation status of their tissue of origin, but the methylation of ntESCs is more similar to that of naturally produced ES cells."
https://openalex.org/W2126580353,"Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) have been derived from various somatic cell populations through ectopic expression of defined factors. It remains unclear whether iPSCs generated from different cell types are molecularly and functionally similar. Here we show that iPSCs obtained from mouse fibroblasts, hematopoietic and myogenic cells exhibit distinct transcriptional and epigenetic patterns. Moreover, we demonstrate that cellular origin influences the in vitro differentiation potentials of iPSCs into embryoid bodies and different hematopoietic cell types. Notably, continuous passaging of iPSCs largely attenuates these differences. Our results suggest that early-passage iPSCs retain a transient epigenetic memory of their somatic cells of origin, which manifests as differential gene expression and altered differentiation capacity. These observations may influence ongoing attempts to use iPSCs for disease modeling and could also be exploited in potential therapeutic applications to enhance differentiation into desired cell lineages."
https://openalex.org/W2017766656,"The hippocampus is an important brain circuit for spatial memory and the spatially selective spiking of hippocampal neuronal assemblies is thought to provide a mnemonic representation of space. We found that remembering newly learnt goal locations required NMDA receptor-dependent stabilization and enhanced reactivation of goal-related hippocampal assemblies. During spatial learning, place-related firing patterns in the CA1, but not CA3, region of the rat hippocampus were reorganized to represent new goal locations. Such reorganization did not occur when goals were marked by visual cues. The stabilization and successful retrieval of these newly acquired CA1 representations of behaviorally relevant places was NMDAR dependent and necessary for subsequent memory retention performance. Goal-related assembly patterns associated with sharp wave/ripple network oscillations, during both learning and subsequent rest periods, predicted memory performance. Together, these results suggest that the reorganization and reactivation of assembly firing patterns in the hippocampus represent the formation and expression of new spatial memory traces."

Beta-cell enriched samples were obtained by laser capture microdissection (LCM). RNA was extracted, amplified and subjected to microarray analysis. Further analysis was performed with DNA-Chip Analyzer (dChip) and Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) software. There were changes in expression of genes linked to glucotoxicity. Evidence of oxidative stress was provided by upregulation of several metallothionein genes. There were few changes in the major genes associated with cell cycle, apoptosis or endoplasmic reticulum stress. There was differential expression of genes associated with pancreatic regeneration, most notably upregulation of members of the regenerating islet gene (REG) family and metalloproteinase 7 (MMP7). Some of the genes found in GWAS studies to be related to T2D were also found to be differentially expressed. IGF2BP2, TSPAN8, and HNF1B (TCF2) were upregulated while JAZF1 and SLC30A8 were downregulated.This study made possible by LCM has identified many novel changes in gene expression that enhance understanding of the pathogenesis of T2D."
https://openalex.org/W2032903160,"Down syndrome is caused by the triplication of chromosome 21, which results in extra copies of hundreds of genes. Chakrabarti et al. used the Ts65Dn mouse model of Down syndrome to show that Olig1 and Olig2, two transcription factor genes that are triplicated in Down syndrome and in the Ts65Dn mouse, are involved in the manifestation of the inhibition/excitation imbalance phenotype. Over-inhibition is thought to be one of the underlying causes of the cognitive deficits in Ts65Dn mice, the most widely used model of Down syndrome. We found a direct link between gene triplication and defects in neuron production during embryonic development. These neurogenesis defects led to an imbalance between excitatory and inhibitory neurons and to increased inhibitory drive in the Ts65Dn forebrain. We discovered that Olig1 and Olig2, two genes that are triplicated in Down syndrome and in Ts65Dn mice, were overexpressed in the Ts65Dn forebrain. To test the hypothesis that Olig triplication causes the neurological phenotype, we used a genetic approach to normalize the dosage of these two genes and thereby rescued the inhibitory neuron phenotype in the Ts65Dn brain. These data identify seminal alterations during brain development and suggest a mechanistic relationship between triplicated genes and these brain abnormalities in the Ts65Dn mouse."

They identify three loci newly associated with susceptibility to this autoimmune liver disease. We genotyped individuals with primary biliary cirrhosis and unaffected controls for suggestive risk loci (genome-wide association P < 1 × 10−4) identified in a previous genome-wide association study. Combined analysis of the genome-wide association and replication datasets identified IRF5-TNPO3 (combined P = 8.66 × 10−13), 17q12-21 (combined P = 3.50 × 10−13) and MMEL1 (combined P = 3.15 × 10−8) as new primary biliary cirrhosis susceptibility loci. Fine-mapping studies showed that a single variant accounts for the IRF5-TNPO3 association. As these loci are implicated in other autoimmune conditions, these findings confirm genetic overlap among such diseases."

https://openalex.org/W2156928448,"Fibroblast differentiation is an essential step during wound healing and fibrosis. Fibronectin (FN) is a major component of the extracellular matrix and occurs in two main forms: plasma and cellular FN. The latter includes the alternatively spliced domain A (EDA). Although EDA-containing cellular fibronectin (EDA-FN) is associated with fibroblast differentiation, how EDA-FN promotes differentiation is incompletely understood. In this study, we investigate the mechanism by which EDA-FN contributes to fibroblast differentiation with emphasis on the characterization of the EDA-FN receptor. We show that EDA-FN increases α-SMA expression (immunofluorescence), collagen deposition, cell contractility, and focal adhesion kinase (FAK) activation (immunoblotting); whereas plasma FN, a form lacking EDA, shows no effect. Primary lung fibroblasts constitutively express α4β7 integrin receptor (FACS and RT-PCR). Blocking of α4β7 reduces fibroblast adhesion to EDA-FN and inhibits α-SMA expression, collagen deposition, and FAK activation induced by EDA-FN. Using recombinant EDA-containing peptides, we demonstrate that the EDA segment is sufficient to induce fibroblast differentiation via binding to α4β7. EDA-FN induces MAPK-Erk1/2 activation and inhibition of MEK1/2 attenuates EDA-FN-induced α-SMA expression. Our findings demonstrate that EDA-FN induces fibroblast differentiation by a mechanism that involves binding of EDA to α4β7 integrin followed by activation of FAK and MAPK-associated signaling pathways.— Kohan, M., Muro, A.

https://openalex.org/W2089195576,"S-Nitrosylation is a ubiquitous post-translational modification that regulates diverse biologic processes. In skeletal muscle, hypernitrosylation of the ryanodine receptor (RyR) causes sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) calcium leak, but whether abnormalities of cardiac RyR nitrosylation contribute to dysfunction of cardiac excitation-contraction coupling remains controversial. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that cardiac RyR2 is hyponitrosylated in heart failure, because of nitroso-redox imbalance. We evaluated excitation-contraction coupling and nitroso-redox balance in spontaneously hypertensive heart failure rats with dilated cardiomyopathy and age-matched Wistar-Kyoto rats. Spontaneously hypertensive heart failure myocytes were characterized by depressed contractility, increased diastolic Ca2+ leak, hyponitrosylation of RyR2, and enhanced xanthine oxidase derived superoxide. Global S-nitrosylation was decreased in failing hearts compared with nonfailing. Xanthine oxidase inhibition restored global and RyR2 nitrosylation and reversed the diastolic SR Ca2+ leak, improving Ca2+ handling and contractility. Together these findings demonstrate that nitroso-redox imbalance causes RyR2 oxidation, hyponitrosylation, and SR Ca2+ leak, a hallmark of cardiac dysfunction. The reversal of this phenotype by inhibition of xanthine oxidase has important pathophysiologic and therapeutic implications.

It is increasingly appreciated that SR calcium leak through the RyR2 is a central lesion leading to diminished myocyte contraction and electrical instability, which enhances the risk of cardiac arrhythmias (1Bers D.M. Physiology. 2006; 21: 380-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). With regard to RyR biology, recent reports implicate elevated nitrosylation of RyR1 with SR Ca2+ leak and skeletal muscle dysfunction (2Bellinger A.M. Reiken S. Dura M. Murphy P.W. Deng S.X. Landry D.W. Nieman D. Lehnart S.E. Samaru M. LaCampagne A. Marks A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 2198-2202Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, 3Bellinger A.M. Reiken S.

Cell. 2008; 133: 53-65Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Paradoxically, we have shown that in cardiac myocytes of neuronal nitric-oxide synthase (NOS1)-deficient mice, decreased S-nitrosylation causes RyR2 leak, decreased contractile reserve, and occurrence of delayed after-depolarizations (5Gonzalez D.R. Beigi F. Treuer A.V. Hare J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 20612-20617Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar).One possible explanation for this paradox relates to nitroso-redox imbalance, a condition in which excess formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) can modify the same thiols that are targets of S-nitrosylation, leading to irreversible protein activation (6Zimmet J.M. Hare J.M. Circulation. 2006; 114: 1531-1544Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Because increased oxidative stress is common in myocardial dysfunction (7Giordano F.J. J. Clin. Invest. 2005; 115: 500-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (1185) Google Scholar), we tested the idea that in the case of RyR2, the channel is hyponitrosylated but similarly subject to SR calcium leak because of increased oxidative modification. The RyR2 is especially sensitive to redox modifications because of the presence of many hyperreactive cysteines (8Xu L. Eu J.P. Meissner G. Stamler J.S. Science. 1998; 279: 234-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (857) Google Scholar), which can be S-nitrosylated (9Gonzalez D.R. Fernandez I.C. Ordenes P.P. Treuer A.V. Eller G. Boric M.P. Nitric Oxide. 2007; 18: 157-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), glutathionylated (10Sánchez G. Pedrozo Z. Domenech R.J. Hidalgo C. Donoso P. J. Mol.

Our results reveal that the channel is hyponitrosylated because of increased oxidative stress, mainly derived from xanthine oxidase (XO), and that reversal of increased ROS formation corrects its function and improves Ca2+ handling.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESWe studied male spontaneous hypertensive-heart failure rats SHHF (∼18 months old) and their normotensive controls, Wistar-Kyoto rats as previously described (12Minhas K.M. Saraiva R.M. Schuleri K.H. Lehrke S. Zheng M. Saliaris A.P. Berry C.E. Barouch L.A. Vandegaer K.M. Li D. Hare J.M. Circ. Res. 2006; 98: 271-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Heart failure was confirmed using echocardiography (see the supplemental material). The Animal Care and Use Committee of the Miller School of Medicine of the University of Miami approved all protocols and experimental procedures.Myocytes were isolated as described in detail in the supplemental material. Intracellular calcium was measured as previously described (5Gonzalez D.R. Beigi F. Treuer A.V. Hare J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 20612-20617Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Cell contractility was estimated measuring sarcomere length as previously described (5Gonzalez D.R. Beigi F. Treuer A.V. Hare J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 20612-20617Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). The degree of sarcomere shortening is expressed as the ratio between the amplitude of the shortening (ΔL) and the base-line sarcomere length (L0).Assessment of SR Ca2+ LeakCalcium leak was assessed as described by Shannon et al. (13Shannon T.R. Ginsburg K.S. Bers D.M. Circ. Res. 2002; 91: 594-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar, 14Shannon T.R. Pogwizd S.M. Bers D.M. Circ. Res. 2003; 93: 592-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). Ventricular myocytes were loaded with fura-2 and paced by field stimulation at the different frequencies in normal Tyrode's solution until cellular Ca2+ transients reached a steady state. After the last pulse, the bath solution was rapidly switched to 0 Na+-0 Ca2+ (Na+ replaced by Li+) Tyrode. In the control condition, [Ca2+]i was monitored, whereas 0 Na+-0 Ca2+ Tyrode buffer was applied for 40 s to eliminate transsarcolemmal Ca2+ fluxes, creating a closed system with a steady state [Ca2+]i. Then a rapid pulse of caffeine (10 mm) was added to cause SR Ca2+ release. After the cell recovers, it was stimulated again in the same conditions, but the 0 Na+-0 Ca2+ Tyrode solution contained 1 mm tetracaine. Under this condition, RyR was blocked, and a shift (decrease) in the fura-2 signal (cytosolic [Ca2+]) was observed. In this condition, the leak was blocked, and the difference in [Ca2+]i between tetracaine and control condition corresponded to diastolic Ca2+ efflux. The amplitude of the caffeine-induced Ca2+ transient was used to estimate the total [Ca2+]i. The load-leak relationship was constructed by grouping cells with similar total SR [Ca2+].Direct Measurement of Intra-SR [Ca2+]iIsolated myocytes were incubated with 1 μm mag-fura-2 acetoxymethyl ester (Molecular Probes Inc., Eugene, OR) for 1 h at room temperature. Then the cells were washed at least three times in normal Tyrode solution, for washout of the indicator out of the cytosol. The cells were used within 2 h for the experiments. With this protocol, 60–80% of the cells consistently displayed downward twitch and caffeine-induced transients, indication that the fluorescence signal originates preferentially from the SR. A similar protocol to fura-2 was used, including tetracaine in 0 Na+-0 Ca2+ solution and caffeine.S-NitrosylationFor determination of RyR2 nitrosylation, the hearts were treated as previously described (9Gonzalez D.R. Fernandez I.C. Ordenes P.P. Treuer A.V. Eller G. Boric M.P. Nitric Oxide. 2007; 18: 157-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), and the biotin switch technique was performed accordingly to Jaffrey et al. (15Jaffrey S.R. Erdjument-Bromage H. Ferris C.D. Tempst P. Snyder S.H. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 193-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (1217) Google Scholar). To visualize S-nitrosylation in cardiac sections, we applied the biotin switch method with modifications (16Ckless K. Reynaert N.L. Taatjes D.J. Lounsbury K.M. van der Vliet A. Janssen-Heininger Y.

Briefly, fresh hearts were embedded in O.C.T. (Tissue-Tek), frozen, cut in 10-μm sections, and fixed in microscope slides. The sections were washed in HEN buffer (see the supplemental material) and fixed with paraformaldehyde 2% for 20 min at room temperature and permeabilized with HEN plus Triton 1%. Sulfhydryl groups were blocked by incubating the slides with HEN-plus 20 mm N-ethylmalemaide for 30 min at 4 °C. After removal of permeabilizing and blocking solutions, the sections were incubated with 1 mm sodium acorbate and 3-[N-(maleimidopropionyl)] biocitin (MBP) as labeling agent, for 1 h at room temperature and then incubated with streptavidin-FITC at 4 °C. The nuclei were stained with DAPI. To visualize S-nitrosylation in isolated cardiomyocytes, we used a rabbit polyclonal anti-S-nitrosocysteine antibody (Sigma).Detection of SuperoxideFresh, unfixed hearts were frozen in O.C.T. (Tissue-Tek). Transverse sections (20 μm thick) were cut in a cryostat and placed on glass slides. The samples were then incubated at room temperature for 30 min with dihydroethidium (DHE, 3 μm; Molecular Probes). After washing with PBS, the sections were fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde for 5 min at 4 °C. Finally, the samples were mounted in Prolong Gold anti-fade (Invitrogen). The images were obtained using a Zeiss LSM-710 confocal microscope. Fluorescence was quantified using the Image-Pro plus software (MediaCybernetics, Silver Spring, MD).Quantification of RyR2 Free ThiolsFree thiols in the RyR2 were assessed using the fluorescent probe for cysteines monobromobimane (Calbiochem, San Diego, CA) as described previously (5Gonzalez D.R. Beigi F. Treuer A.V. Hare J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 20612-20617Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Proteins were resolved in 3–8% Tris acetate gels and transilluminated with UV light. Total RyR2 was identified upon silver staining of the gel and confirmed by Western blotting with anti-RyR2. Free cysteine content is expressed as the ratio of the optical density of the UV signal to the total RyR signal.Confocal MicroscopyHeart sections and isolated myocytes were prepared as described above, fixed in paraformaldehyde 2%, and incubated overnight at 4 °C with monoclonal antibodies to NOS1 (BD Bioscience), anti-RyR2 (Affinity BioReagent), and xanthine oxidase (NeoMarkers) and polyclonal antibodies against S-nitrosocysteine (Sigma), NOS1, and xanthine oxidase (Santa Cruz). Secondary incubations were performed at 37 °C for 1 h using anti-mouse TRITC and anti-rabbit FITC (Jackson Immunoresearch, West Grove PA) using a Zeiss LSM-710 confocal microscope. To validate the specificity of the signal obtained with the anti-S-nitrosocysteine antibody, we performed two controls: first, we used normal rabbit serum instead of the antibody, and second, before incubating with anti-S-nitrosocysteine antibody, the samples were treated with HgCl2 (0.2% in PBS, 30 min) to degrade the S-nitrosylation bonds (18Gow A.J.

Chem. 2002; 277: 9637-9640Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar).Co-localization AnalysisQuantitative co-localization analysis was performed after the images were deconvolved, using Huygens Essential software (Scientific Volume Imaging, Hilversum, The Netherlands) computing the Pearson correlation coefficient, as recommended (19Scriven D.R.

Cytochem. 2007; 40: 101-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar).Statistical AnalysisThe data are expressed as the means ± S.E. For comparisons of two groups, Student's t test was used. For comparison of three or more groups, one- or two-way analysis of variance was performed with Newman-Keuls post-hoc test. For both tests, a p value of less than 0.05 was considered significant.RESULTSPreviously, we described increased XO activity in the SHHF rat heart (12Minhas K.M. Saraiva R.M. Schuleri K.H. Lehrke S. Zheng M. Saliaris A.P. Berry C.E. Barouch L.A. Vandegaer K.M. Li D. Hare J.M. Circ. Res. 2006; 98: 271-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). To confirm this, we measured an abundance of XO. Using immunofluorescence (Fig. 1A), we found that XO expression was increased in heart tissue sections of failing hearts compared with nonfailing (34.4 ± 5.6 fluorescence units in WKY versus 91.8 ± 11.2 in SHHF, p < 0.005). Up-regulation of XO was confirmed by Western blot analysis (Fig. 1B). Furthermore, at the single myocyte level at high magnification (Fig. 1C), it can be appreciated that the localization of XO is in close vicinity to the RyR2. In fact, the degree of co-localization between both proteins is increased in the failing hearts (p < 0.0001), consistent with an up-regulation of XO.Redox State of RyR2Given the proximity of XO and RyR2, it would be expected that an up-regulation of XO could alter the redox state of the channel, as well as its function. We previously described that decreased S-nitrosylation of the ryanodine receptor (RyR2) altered the channel activity, inducing sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ leak and reducing contractility (5Gonzalez D.R. Beigi F. Treuer A.V. Hare J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 20612-20617Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). We investigated here the degree of S-nitrosylation of RyR2 with the biotin switch assay (Fig. 2A). Consistent with the global histological studies, the level of S-nitrosylated RyR2 was lower in the failing hearts (5.6 ± 1.8 densitometric units in WKY versus 1.9 ± 1.0 in SHHF, p < 0.05, n = 5 WKY and 6 SHHF hearts). Next, we measured the levels of free thiols (SH-RyR2) using the monobromobimane assay (Fig. 2B). Relative free thiols levels were lower in the failing hearts (14.1 ± 1.4 densitometric units in WKY versus 9.5 ± 1.0 in SHHF, p < 0.05, n = 3 WKY and 4 SHHF hearts), suggesting, along with decreased S-nitrosylation, increased oxidation of cysteine residues. Finally, we analyzed the amount of phosphorylated RyR2 in serine 2809, because this modification has been related to RyR2 leak and the progression to HF (21Wehrens X.H. Lehnart S.E. Reiken S. Vest J.A. Wronska A. Marks A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 511-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). There were no differences in the ratio of phosphorylated to total RyR2 between strains, although both were intensively phosphorylated (0.89 ± 0.07 WKY, n = 4 versus 0.80 ± 0.06 SHHF, n = 5). Together, these results strongly suggest that in heart failure, RyR2 has lost S-nitrosylated cysteines, and they are highly oxidized.FIGURE 2Redox modifications of ryanodine receptor in heart failure.

For this reason, we evaluated the level of the three NOS isoforms (Fig. 2C). NOS1 was increased (both α and μ isoforms), consistent with previous reports in heart failure (22Bendall J.K. Damy T.

NOS3 levels were not different between strains, and NOS2 expression was below our limit of detection. These results suggest that changes in NOS expression are not a cause for decreased S-nitrosylation in this model of heart failure.Nitroso-redox PathwaysWe studied the levels of nitrogen reactive species (S-nitrosylation) and ROS in WKY and SHHF hearts (Fig. 3). The levels of ROS detected by oxidative microphotography with DHE staining (Fig. 3A) were increased in the heart failure rats. Perfusion of isolated hearts with the xanthine oxidase inhibitor oxypurinol (100 μm, 45 min) decreased the levels of ROS in the failing hearts to levels similar to the nonfailing hearts.FIGURE 3Nitroso-redox imbalance in heart failure is restored by XO inhibition.

We applied a modified biotin switch protocol for in situ detection of nitrosylated proteins in fresh myocardial sections (Fig. 3B). The S-nitrosylation signal was diminished in the failing hearts compared with WKY (p < 0.05). The treatment with oxypurinol restored the levels of S-nitrosylation in the failing hearts to normal levels and even increased S-nitrosylation in WKY hearts (p < 0.05).RyR2 NitrosylationTo test whether increased XO activity had a causal relationship with the levels of nitrosylation of RyR2, we analyzed the level of S-nitrosylation of cardiac RyR2 in isolated myocytes treated with or without oxypurinol. Using confocal microscopy, we compared the degree of co-localization for RyR2 and S-nitrosocysteine in isolated cardiomyocytes. In WKY, a clear co-localization between RyR2 and S-nitrosocysteine was observed (Fig. 4). On the contrary, the co-localization was significantly decreased in SHHF myocytes, due mainly to the general reduction in S-nitrosothiols. Incubation with oxypurinol (100 μm, 60 min (24Kögler H. Fraser H. McCune S. Altschuld R. Marbán E. Cardiovasc. Res. 2003; 59: 582-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar)) significantly increased the general level of S-nitrosylation (p < 0.05) and, in particular, the degree of S-nitrosylation associated with the RyR2. Thus, XO inhibition restored the redox state of RyR2.FIGURE 4In situ analysis of ryanodine receptor S-nitrosylation and impact of XO inhibition.

To this end, we assessed contractility and calcium handling in this model by measuring sarcomere shortening of isolated myocytes and the amplitude of the Ca2+ transients (Fig. 5). When myocytes were paced from 0.5 to 4 Hz of stimulation, the degree of sarcomere shortening was relatively flat in WKY myocytes. Conversely, in SHHF myocytes, the response was negative, i.e. the degree of sarcomere shortening decreased with the increased frequency of stimulation as has been previously described (25Janssen P.M. Stull L.B. Leppo M.K. Altschuld R.A. Marbán E. Am. J. Physiol. Heart Circ. Physiol. 2003; 284: H772-H778Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) (Fig. 5A). This decrease in contractility was correlated with the levels of intracellular calcium. In WKY, the amplitude of the transients increased with frequency, but in the failing myocytes it remained relatively constant (Fig. 5B). In the failing myocytes, both cell contractility and Ca2+ transients were improved when the cells were incubated with oxypurinol (100 μm for 40 min). Shorter incubation times did not produce an effect, and oxypurinol did not affect contractility or calcium transients in WKY cells (data not shown).FIGURE 5Impaired contractility in heart failure is restored by XO inhibition.

For this, we measured the diastolic SR Ca2+ efflux using tetracaine as an inhibitor of RyR2 (Fig. 6A) as has been previously described (13Shannon T.R. Ginsburg K.S. Bers D.M. Circ. Res. 2002; 91: 594-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar, 14Shannon T.R. Pogwizd S.M. Bers D.M. Circ. Res. 2003; 93: 592-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). When comparing the amount of Ca2+ leak at matched Ca2+ contents (assessed by caffeine application), we found an increased diastolic SR efflux in the failing myocytes. This was reduced by oxypurinol treatment to the levels of the nonfailing myocytes. We also assessed intra-SR Ca2+ directly using the low affinity Ca2+ (Kd = 50 μm) indicator mag-fura2 (Fig. 6B). Using mag-fura2, the Ca2+ transient is shown as a downward shift, because it denotes the Ca2+ content within the SR. Upon caffeine application, SR is emptied of Ca2+. Using this technique, we found that the intra-SR Ca2+ content is significantly reduced in failing myocytes. Incubation of myocytes with oxypurinol (100 μm, 40 min) restored the SR Ca2+ content toward the value observed in the nonfailing myocytes. Together, these results demonstrate that the redox imbalance created by XO up-regulation directly impacts on the calcium-cycling process, particularly at the level of the RyR2, because of its high redox dependence.FIGURE 6Diastolic SR Ca2+ leak is reversed by XO inhibition. A, protocol for assessment of SR Ca2+ leak. The cells are paced until a steady [Ca2+]i is observed, then the pacing is stopped, and the bathing solution is changed to a 0 Na+-0 Ca2+ solution containing tetracaine (1 mm), for 40 s. After this period, the solution is changed for ∼5 s to a 0 Na+-0 Ca2+ solution without tetracaine, and then a pulse of caffeine (10 mm) is applied to release the Ca2+ of the SR. The shift in the Ca2+ during tetracaine application accounts for the diastolic Ca2+ efflux from the SR. The bar graphs indicate comparison of SR leak (left bar graph) at a matched Ca2+ load for the three groups (right bar graph). *, p < 0.05 versus WKY and SHHF + oxypurinol (Oxy), one-way analysis of variance.

https://openalex.org/W2014999887,"Understanding serotonergic (5-HT) signaling is critical for understanding human physiology, behavior, and neuropsychiatric disease. 5-HT mediates its actions via ionotropic and metabotropic 5-HT receptors. The 5-HT(1A) receptor is a metabotropic G protein-coupled receptor linked to the G(i/o) signaling pathway and has been specifically implicated in the pathogenesis of depression and anxiety. To understand and precisely control 5-HT(1A) signaling, we created a light-activated G protein-coupled receptor that targets into 5-HT(1A) receptor domains and substitutes for endogenous 5-HT(1A) receptors. To induce 5-HT(1A)-like targeting, vertebrate rhodopsin was tagged with the C-terminal domain (CT) of 5-HT(1A) (Rh-CT(5-HT1A)). Rh-CT(5-HT1A) activates G protein-coupled inward rectifying K(+) channels in response to light and causes membrane hyperpolarization in hippocampal neurons, similar to the agonist-induced responses of the 5-HT(1A) receptor. The intracellular distribution of Rh-CT(5-HT1A) resembles that of the 5-HT(1A) receptor; Rh-CT(5-HT1A) localizes to somatodendritic sites and is efficiently trafficked to distal dendritic processes. Additionally, neuronal expression of Rh-CT(5-HT1A), but not Rh, decreases 5-HT(1A) agonist sensitivity, suggesting that Rh-CT(5-HT1A) and 5-HT(1A) receptors compete to interact with the same trafficking machinery. Finally, Rh-CT(5-HT1A) is able to rescue 5-HT(1A) signaling of 5-HT(1A) KO mice in cultured neurons and in slices of the dorsal raphe showing that Rh-CT(5-HT1A) is able to functionally compensate for native 5-HT(1A). Thus, as an optogenetic tool, Rh-CT(5-HT1A) has the potential to directly correlate in vivo 5-HT(1A) signaling with 5-HT neuron activity and behavior in both normal animals and animal models of neuropsychiatric disease."
https://openalex.org/W2138017682,"Melanomas display poor response rates to adjuvant therapies because of their intrinsic resistance to proapoptotic stimuli. This study indicates that such resistance can be overcome, at least partly, through the targeting of eEF1A elongation factor with narciclasine, an Amaryllidaceae isocarbostyril controlling plant growth. Narciclasine displays IC50 growth inhibitory values between 30–100 nM in melanoma cell lines, irrespective of their levels of resistance to proapoptotic stimuli. Normal noncancerous cell lines are much less affected. At nontoxic doses, narciclasine also significantly improves (P=0.004) the survival of mice bearing metastatic apoptosis-resistant melanoma xenografts in their brain. The eEF1A targeting with narciclasine (50 nM) leads to 1) marked actin cytoskeleton disorganization, resulting in cytokinesis impairment, and 2) protein synthesis impairment (elongation and initiation steps), whereas apoptosis is induced at higher doses only (≥200 nM). In addition to molecular docking validation and identification of potential binding sites, we biochemically confirmed that narciclasine directly binds to human recombinant and yeast-purified eEF1A in a nanomolar range, but not to actin or elongation factor 2, and that 5 nM narciclasine is sufficient to impair eEF1A-related actin bundling activity. eEF1A is thus a potential target to combat melanomas regardless of their apoptosis-sensitivity, and this finding reconciles the pleiotropic cytostatic of narciclasine.—Van Goietsenoven, G., Hutton, J., Becker, J.-P., Lallemand, B., Robert, F., Lefranc, F., Pirker, C., Vandenbussche, G., Van Antwerpen, P., Evidente, A., Berger, W., Prevost, M., Pelletier, J., Kiss, R., Goss Kinzy, T., Kornienko, A., Mathieu, V.

https://openalex.org/W2038926537,"The authors studied hippocampal networks in mouse slices in vitro and found that theta-related place-cell activity in the hippocampus is generated through an interaction between a phasic dendritic excitation and a phasic perisomatic shunting inhibition mediated by interneurons. Although hippocampal theta oscillations represent a prime example of temporal coding in the mammalian brain, little is known about the specific biophysical mechanisms. Intracellular recordings support a particular abstract oscillatory interference model of hippocampal theta activity, the soma-dendrite interference model. To gain insight into the cellular and circuit level mechanisms of theta activity, we implemented a similar form of interference using the actual hippocampal network in mice in vitro. We found that pairing increasing levels of phasic dendritic excitation with phasic stimulation of perisomatic projecting inhibitory interneurons induced a somatic polarization and action potential timing profile that reproduced most common features. Alterations in the temporal profile of inhibition were required to fully capture all features. These data suggest that theta-related place cell activity is generated through an interaction between a phasic dendritic excitation and a phasic perisomatic shunting inhibition delivered by interneurons, a subset of which undergo activity-dependent presynaptic modulation."
https://openalex.org/W2110430049,"Increased levels of Ca2+ in cardiomyocytes promote cell growth that, under stressful conditions, such as those caused by hypertension, can contribute to heart remodeling and failure. Joerg Heineke et al. identify a new regulator of this type of maladaptive cardiac muscle growth in mice, the calcium-binding protein CIB1, which they show regulates the membrane-association of calcineurin and downstream signaling. Hypertrophic heart disease is a leading health problem in Western countries. Here we identified the small EF hand domain–containing protein Ca2+ and integrin–binding protein-1 (CIB1) in a screen for previously unknown regulators of cardiomyocyte hypertrophy. Yeast two-hybrid screening for CIB1-interacting partners identified a related EF hand domain–containing protein, calcineurin B, the regulatory subunit of the prohypertrophic protein phosphatase calcineurin. CIB1 localizes primarily to the sarcolemma in mouse and human myocardium, where it anchors calcineurin to control its activation in coordination with the L-type Ca2+ channel. CIB1 protein amounts and membrane association were enhanced in cardiac pathological hypertrophy, but not in physiological hypertrophy. Consistent with these observations, Cib1-deleted mice showed a marked reduction in myocardial hypertrophy, fibrosis, cardiac dysfunction and calcineurin–nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) activity after pressure overload, whereas the degree of physiologic hypertrophy after swimming exercise was not altered. Transgenic mice with inducible and cardiac-specific overexpression of CIB1 showed enhanced cardiac hypertrophy in response to pressure overload or calcineurin signaling. Moreover, mice lacking Ppp3cb (encoding calcineurin A, β isozyme) showed no enhancement in cardiac hypertrophy associated with CIB1 overexpression. Thus, CIB1 functions as a previously undescribed regulator of cardiac hypertrophy through its ability to regulate the association of calcineurin with the sarcolemma and its activation."

A study by Caspi et al has suggested that rs174575 within the FADS2 gene moderates this effect so that children homozygous in the minor allele (GG genotype) have similar IQs irrespective of feeding method. Methods and Principal Findings In our study of 5934 children aged 8 years, no genetic main effect with IQ was found for rs174575. However, an interaction with this polymorphism was observed such that breastfed GG children performed better than their formula fed counterparts by an additional 5.8 points [1.4, 10.1] (interaction p = 0.0091). Interaction results were attenuated by about 10% after adjustment for 7 factors. This study also investigated rs1535, another FADS2 polymorphism in linkage disequilibrium with rs174575, together with performance and verbal IQ, finding similar results although effect sizes were generally reduced.

Here we report the discovery of deoxygedunin, which activates the mouse TrkB receptor and its downstream signaling cascades. Deoxygedunin is orally available and activates TrkB in mouse brain in a BDNF-independent way. Strikingly, it prevents the degeneration of vestibular ganglion in BDNF −/− pups. Moreover, deoxygedunin robustly protects rat neurons from cell death in a TrkB-dependent manner. Further, administration of deoxygedunin into mice displays potent neuroprotective, anti-depressant and learning enhancement effects, all of which are mediated by the TrkB receptor. Hence, deoxygedunin imitates BDNF's biological activities through activating TrkB, providing a powerful therapeutic tool for treatment of various neurological diseases."
https://openalex.org/W1981463242,"Chemotherapy and radiotherapy commonly damage DNA and trigger p53-dependent apoptosis through intrinsic apoptotic pathways. Two unfortunate consequences of this mechanism are resistance due to blockade of p53 or intrinsic apoptosis pathways, and mutagenesis of non-malignant surviving cells which can impair cellular function or provoke second malignancies. Death ligand-based drugs, such as tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis inducing ligand (TRAIL), stimulate extrinsic apoptotic signaling, and may overcome resistance to treatments that induce intrinsic apoptosis. As death receptor ligation does not damage DNA as a primary mechanism of pro-apoptotic action, we hypothesized that surviving cells would remain genetically unscathed, suggesting that death ligand-based therapies may avoid some of the adverse effects associated with traditional cancer treatments. Surprisingly, however, treatment with sub-lethal concentrations of TRAIL or FasL was mutagenic. Mutations arose in viable cells that contained active caspases, and overexpression of the caspase-8 inhibitor crmA or silencing of caspase-8 abolished TRAIL-mediated mutagenesis. Downregulation of the apoptotic nuclease caspase-activated DNAse (CAD)/DNA fragmentation factor 40 (DFF40) prevented the DNA damage associated with TRAIL treatment. Although death ligands do not need to damage DNA in order to induce apoptosis, surviving cells nevertheless incur DNA damage after treatment with these agents."

However, analysis of the intestinal microbiota has not yet been applicable in large-scale clinical research or routine diagnostics because of the complex and expensive nature of the techniques needed. Here, we describe a new PCR-based profiling technique for high-throughput analysis of the human intestinal microbiota, which we have termed IS-pro. This technique combines bacterial species differentiation by the length of the 16S-23S rDNA interspace region with instant taxonomic classification by phylum-specific fluorescent labeling of PCR primers. We validated IS-pro in silico, in vitro, and in vivo, on human colonic biopsies and feces, and introduced a standardized protocol for data analysis. IS-pro is easy to implement in general clinical microbiological laboratories with access to capillary gel electrophoresis, and the high-throughput nature of the test makes analysis of large numbers of samples feasible.

https://openalex.org/W2036842663,"The transcription factor E2F1 has a crucial role in the control of cell growth and has been shown to regulate neoangiogenesis in a p53-dependent manner through inhibition of activity of the VEGF-A (vascular endothelial growth factor) promoter. Besides being regulated by transcription, VEGF-A is also highly regulated by pre-mRNA alternative splicing, resulting in the expression of several VEGF isoforms with either pro-(VEGFxxx) or anti-(VEGFxxxb) angiogenic properties. Recently, we identified the SR (Ser-Rich/Arg) protein SC35, a splicing factor, as a new transcriptional target of E2F1. Here, we show that E2F1 downregulates the activity of the VEGF-A promoter in tumour cells independently of p53, leading to a strong decrease in VEGFxxx mRNA levels. We further show that, strikingly, E2F1 alters the ratio of pro-VEGFxxx versus anti-VEGFxxxb angiogenic isoforms, favouring the antiangiogenic isoforms, by a mechanism involving the induction of SC35 expression. Finally, using lung tumour xenografts in nude mice, we provide evidence that E2F1 and SC35 proteins increase the VEGF165b/VEGF ratio and decrease tumour neovascularization in vivo. Overall, these findings highlight E2F1 and SC35 as two regulators of the VEGFxxx/VEGFxxxb angiogenic switch in human cancer cells, a role that could be crucial during tumour progression, as well as in tumour response to antiangiogenic therapies."
https://openalex.org/W2004122033,"Introduction HIV care and treatment services are primarily delivered in vertical antiretroviral (ART) clinics in sub-Saharan Africa but there have been concerns over the impact on existing primary health care services. This paper presents results from a feasibility study of a fully integrated model of HIV and non-HIV outpatient services in two urban Lusaka clinics. Methods Integration involved three key modifications: i) amalgamation of space and patient flow; ii) standardization of medical records and iii) introduction of routine provider initiated testing and counseling (PITC). Assessment of feasibility included monitoring rates of HIV case-finding and referral to care, measuring median waiting and consultation times and assessing adherence to clinical care protocols for HIV and non-HIV outpatients. Qualitative data on patient/provider perceptions was also collected. Findings Provider and patient interviews at both sites indicated broad acceptability of the model and highlighted a perceived reduction in stigma associated with integrated HIV services. Over six months in Clinic 1, PITC was provided to 2760 patients; 1485 (53%) accepted testing, 192 (13%) were HIV positive and 80 (42%) enrolled. Median OPD patient-provider contact time increased 55% (6.9 vs. 10.7 minutes; p<0.001) and decreased 1% for ART patients (27.9 vs. 27.7 minutes; p = 0.94). Median waiting times increased by 36 (p<0.001) and 23 minutes (p<0.001) for ART and OPD patients respectively. In Clinic 2, PITC was offered to 1510 patients, with 882 (58%) accepting testing, 208 (24%) HIV positive and 121 (58%) enrolled. Median OPD patient-provider contact time increased 110% (6.1 vs. 12.8 minutes; p<0.001) and decreased for ART patients by 23% (23 vs. 17.7 minutes; p<0.001). Median waiting times increased by 47 (p<0.001) and 34 minutes (p<0.001) for ART and OPD patients, respectively. Conclusions Integrating vertical ART and OPD services is feasible in the low-resource and high HIV-prevalence setting of Lusaka, Zambia. Integration enabled shared use of space and staffing that resulted in increased HIV case finding, a reduction in stigma associated with vertical ART services but resulted in an overall increase in patient waiting times. Further research is urgently required to assess long-term clinical outcomes and cost effectiveness in order to evaluate scalability and generalizability."
https://openalex.org/W2109549845,"A strong link exists between low aerobic exercise capacity and complex metabolic diseases. To probe this linkage, we utilized rat models of low and high intrinsic aerobic endurance running capacity that differ also in the risk for metabolic syndrome. We investigated in skeletal muscle gene-phenotype relationships that connect aerobic endurance capacity with metabolic disease risk factors. The study compared 12 high capacity runners (HCRs) and 12 low capacity runners (LCRs) from generation 18 of selection that differed by 615% for maximal treadmill endurance running capacity. On average, LCRs were heavier and had increased blood glucose, insulin, and triglycerides compared with HCRs. HCRs were higher for resting metabolic rate, voluntary activity, serum high density lipoproteins, muscle capillarity, and mitochondrial area. Bioinformatic analysis of skeletal muscle gene expression data revealed that many genes up-regulated in HCRs were related to oxidative energy metabolism. Seven mean mRNA expression centroids, including oxidative phosphorylation and fatty acid metabolism, correlated significantly with several exercise capacity and disease risk phenotypes. These expression-phenotype correlations, together with diminished skeletal muscle capillarity and mitochondrial area in LCR rats, support the general hypothesis that an inherited intrinsic aerobic capacity can underlie disease risks.—Kivelä, R., Silvennoinen, M., Lehti, M., Rinnankoski-Tuikka, R., Purhonen, T., Ketola, T., Pullinen, K., Vuento, M., Mutanen, N., Sartor, M.

MT1-MMP promoter activity (murine luciferase reporter) increased 20-fold at 3 days and 50-fold at 14 days post-MI. MI was then induced in mice with cardiac restricted MT1-MMPexp (n = 58) and wild type (WT, n = 60). Post-MI survival was reduced (67% versus 46%, p < 0.05), and LV ejection fraction was lower in the post-MI MT1-MMPexp mice compared with WT (41 ± 2 versus 32 ± 2%,p < 0.05). In the post-MI MT1-MMPexp mice, LV myocardial MMP activity, as assessed by radiotracer uptake, and MT1-MMP-specific proteolytic activity using a specific fluorogenic assay were both increased by 2-fold. LV collagen content was increased by nearly 2-fold in the post-MI MT1-MMPexp compared with WT. Using a validated fluorogenic construct, it was discovered that MT1-MMP proteolytically processed the pro-fibrotic molecule, latency-associated transforming growth factor-1 binding protein (LTBP-1), and MT1-MMP-specific LTBP-1 proteolytic activity was increased by 4-fold in the post-MI MT1-MMPexp group. Early and persistent MT1-MMP promoter activity occurred post-MI, and increased myocardial MT1-MMP levels resulted in poor survival, worsening of LV function, and significant fibrosis. A molecular mechanism for the adverse LV matrix remodeling with MT1-MMP induction is increased processing of pro-fibrotic signaling molecules. Thus, a proteolytically diverse portfolio exists for MT1-MMP within the myocardium and likely plays a mechanistic role in adverse LV remodeling. The membrane type-1 matrix metalloproteinase (MT1-MMP) is a unique member of the MMP family, but induction patterns and consequences of MT1-MMP overexpression (MT1-MMPexp), in a left ventricular (LV) remodeling process such as myocardial infarction (MI), have not been explored. MT1-MMP promoter activity (murine luciferase reporter) increased 20-fold at 3 days and 50-fold at 14 days post-MI. MI was then induced in mice with cardiac restricted MT1-MMPexp (n = 58) and wild type (WT, n = 60). Post-MI survival was reduced (67% versus 46%, p < 0.05), and LV ejection fraction was lower in the post-MI MT1-MMPexp mice compared with WT (41 ± 2 versus 32 ± 2%,p < 0.05). In the post-MI MT1-MMPexp mice, LV myocardial MMP activity, as assessed by radiotracer uptake, and MT1-MMP-specific proteolytic activity using a specific fluorogenic assay were both increased by 2-fold. LV collagen content was increased by nearly 2-fold in the post-MI MT1-MMPexp compared with WT. Using a validated fluorogenic construct, it was discovered that MT1-MMP proteolytically processed the pro-fibrotic molecule, latency-associated transforming growth factor-1 binding protein (LTBP-1), and MT1-MMP-specific LTBP-1 proteolytic activity was increased by 4-fold in the post-MI MT1-MMPexp group.

https://openalex.org/W2149861874,"Despite the distinctive structure of mitotic chromosomes, it has not been possible to visualise individual chromosomes in living interphase cells, where chromosomes spend over 90% of their time. Studies of interphase chromosome structure and dynamics use fluorescence in-situ hybridisation (FISH) on fixed cells, which potentially damages structure and loses dynamic information. We have developed a new methodology, involving photoactivation of labelled histone H3 at mitosis, to visualise individual and specific human chromosomes in living interphase cells. Our data revealed bulk chromosome volume and morphology are established rapidly after mitosis, changing only incrementally after the first hour of G1. This contrasted with the behaviour of specific loci on labelled chromosomes, which showed more progressive reorganisation, and revealed that ""looping out"" of chromatin from chromosome territories is a dynamic state. We measured considerable heterogeneity in chromosome decondensation, even between sister chromatids, which may reflect local structural impediments to decondensation and could potentially amplify transcriptional noise. Chromosome structure showed tremendous resistance to inhibitors of transcription, histone deacetylation and chromatin remodelling. Together, these data indicate steric constraints determine structure, rather than innate chromosome architecture or function-driven anchoring, with interphase chromatin organisation governed primarily by opposition between needs for decondensation and the space available for this to happen."
https://openalex.org/W2001012387,"Autism is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by a specific triad of symptoms such as abnormalities in social interaction, abnormalities in communication and restricted activities and interests. While verbal autistic subjects may present a correct mastery of the formal aspects of speech, they have difficulties in prosody (music of speech), leading to communication disorders. Few behavioural studies have revealed a prosodic impairment in children with autism, and among the few fMRI studies aiming at assessing the neural network involved in language, none has specifically studied prosodic speech. The aim of the present study was to characterize specific prosodic components such as linguistic prosody (intonation, rhythm and emphasis) and emotional prosody and to correlate them with the neural network underlying them.We used a behavioural test (Profiling Elements of the Prosodic System, PEPS) and fMRI to characterize prosodic deficits and investigate the neural network underlying prosodic processing. Results revealed the existence of a link between perceptive and productive prosodic deficits for some prosodic components (rhythm, emphasis and affect) in HFA and also revealed that the neural network involved in prosodic speech perception exhibits abnormal activation in the left SMG as compared to controls (activation positively correlated with intonation and emphasis) and an absence of deactivation patterns in regions involved in the default mode.These prosodic impairments could not only result from activation patterns abnormalities but also from an inability to adequately use the strategy of the default network inhibition, both mechanisms that have to be considered for decreasing task performance in High Functioning Autism."

By a comparative transcriptome analysis with DNA microarrays of a Δ<i>rosR</i> mutant and the wild type and subsequent EMSAs with purified RosR protein, direct target genes of RosR were identified. The <i>narKGHJI</i> operon, which encodes a nitrate/nitrite transporter and the dissimilatory nitrate reductase complex, was activated by RosR. All other target genes were repressed by RosR. They encode four putative monooxygenases, two putative FMN reductases, a protein of the glutathione <i>S</i>-transferase family, a putative polyisoprenoid-binding protein, and RosR itself. The DNA binding site of RosR was characterized as an 18-bp inverted repeat with the consensus sequence TTGTTGAYRYRTCAACWA. The <i>in vitro</i> DNA binding activity of RosR was reversibly inhibited by the oxidant H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. Mutational analysis of the three cysteine residues present in RosR (Cys-64, Cys-92, and Cys-151) showed that these are responsible for the inhibition of DNA binding by H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>.

https://openalex.org/W1997503854,"The dipeptide N-acetylaspartyl-glutamate (NAAG) is an abundant neuropeptide in the mammalian brain. Despite this fact, its physiological role is poorly understood. NAAG is synthesized by a NAAG synthetase catalyzing the ATP-dependent condensation of N-acetylaspartate and glutamate. In vitro NAAG synthetase activity has not been described, and the enzyme has not been purified. Using a bioinformatics approach we identified a putative dipeptide synthetase specifically expressed in the nervous system. Expression of the gene, which we named NAAGS (for NAAG synthetase) was sufficient to induce NAAG synthesis in primary astrocytes or CHO-K1 and HEK-293T cells when they coexpressed the NAA transporter NaDC3. Furthermore, coexpression of NAAGS and the recently identified N-acetylaspartate (NAA) synthase, Nat8l, in CHO-K1 or HEK-293T cells was sufficient to enable these cells to synthesize NAAG. Identity of the reaction product of NAAGS was confirmed by HPLC and electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (ESI-MS). High expression levels of NAAGS were restricted to the brain, spinal cord, and testis. Taken together our results strongly suggest that the identified gene encodes a NAAG synthetase. Its identification will enable further studies to examine the role of this abundant neuropeptide in the vertebrate nervous system."
https://openalex.org/W2127132412,"Resident tissue macrophages are activated by the fungal pathogen Candida albicans to release eicosanoids, which are important modulators of inflammation and immune responses. Our objective was to identify the macrophage receptors engaged by C. albicans that mediate activation of group IVA cytosolic phospholipase A(2) (cPLA(2)α), a regulatory enzyme that releases arachidonic acid (AA) for production of prostaglandins and leukotrienes. A comparison of peritoneal macrophages from wild type and knock-out mice demonstrates that the β-glucan receptor Dectin-1 and MyD88 regulate early release of AA and eicosanoids in response to C. albicans. However, cyclooxygenase 2 (COX2) expression and later phase eicosanoid production are defective in MyD88(-/-) but not Dectin-1(-/-) macrophages. Furthermore, C. albicans-stimulated activation of MAPK and phosphorylation of cPLA(2)α on Ser-505 are regulated by MyD88 and not Dectin-1. In contrast, Dectin-1 mediates MAPK activation, cPLA(2)α phosphorylation, and COX2 expression in response to particulate β-glucan suggesting that other receptors engaged by C. albicans preferentially mediate these responses. Results also implicate the mannan-binding receptor Dectin-2 in regulating cPLA(2)α. C. albicans-stimulated MAPK activation and AA release are blocked by d-mannose and Dectin-2-specific antibody, and overexpression of Dectin-2 in RAW264.7 macrophages enhances C. albicans-stimulated MAPK activation, AA release, and COX2 expression. In addition, calcium mobilization is enhanced in RAW264.7 macrophages overexpressing Dectin-1 or -2. The results demonstrate that C. albicans engages both β-glucan and mannan-binding receptors on macrophages that act with MyD88 to regulate the activation of cPLA(2)α and eicosanoid production."
https://openalex.org/W2138396104,"The urinary bladder and associated tract are lined by the urothelium, a transitional epithelium that acts as a specialized permeability barrier that protects the underlying tissue from urine via expression of a highly specific group of proteins known as the uroplakins (UP). To date, our understanding of the developmental processes responsible for urothelial differentiation has been hampered due to the lack of suitable models. In this study, we describe a novel in vitro cell culture system for derivation of urothelial cells from murine embryonic stem cells (ESCs) following cultivation on collagen matrices in the presence all trans retinoic acid (RA). Upon stimulation with micromolar concentrations of RA, ESCs significantly downregulated the pluripotency factor OCT-4 but markedly upregulated UP1A, UP1B, UP2, UP3A, and UP3B mRNA levels in comparison to naïve ESCs and spontaneously differentiating controls. Pan-UP protein expression was associated with both p63- and cytokeratin 20-positive cells in discrete aggregating populations of ESCs following 9 and 14 days of RA stimulation. Analysis of endodermal transcription factors such as GATA4 and GATA6 revealed significant upregulation and nuclear enrichment in RA-treated UP2-GFP+ populations. GATA4-/- and GATA6-/- transgenic ESC lines revealed substantial attenuation of RA-mediated UP expression in comparison to wild type controls. In addition, EMSA analysis revealed that RA treatment induced formation of transcriptional complexes containing GATA4/6 on both UP1B and UP2 promoter fragments containing putative GATA factor binding sites. Collectively, these data suggest that RA mediates ESC specification toward a urothelial lineage via GATA4/6-dependent processes."

Recently, we identified Ulk3 as an active kinase able to positively regulate Gli proteins, mediators of the Shh signaling in mammals. Here, we provide several lines of evidence that Ulk3 participates in the transduction of the Shh signal also independently of its kinase activity. We demonstrate that Ulk3 through its kinase domain interacts with Suppressor of Fused (Sufu), a protein required for negative regulation of Gli proteins. Sufu blocks Ulk3 autophosphorylation and abolishes its ability to phosphorylate and positively regulate Gli proteins. We show that Shh signaling destabilizes the Sufu-Ulk3 complex and induces the release of Ulk3. We demonstrate that the Sufu-Ulk3 complex, when co-expressed with Gli2, promotes generation of the Gli2 repressor form, and that reduction of the Ulk3 mRNA level in Shh-responsive cells results in higher potency of the cells to transmit the Shh signal. Our data suggests a dual function of Ulk3 in the Shh signal transduction pathway and propose an additional way of regulating Gli proteins by Sufu, through binding to and suppression of Ulk3.

Scott M.P. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 6: 306-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar). In adults, the pathway is implicated in tissue homeostasis maintenance and stem cell proliferation (2Beachy P.A. Karhadkar S.S. Berman D.M. Nature. 2004; 432: 324-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (1023) Google Scholar, 3Ingham P.W. McMahon A.P. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 3059-3087Crossref PubMed Scopus (2504) Google Scholar). Because inappropriate activation of the HH pathway contributes to various congenital abnormalities and tumorigenesis in humans, investigations of the molecular signaling mechanisms should shed light not only on developmental but also on important pathological issues. The hh signaling pathway was initially discovered in Drosophila melanogaster (4Nüsslein-Volhard C. Wieschaus E. Nature. 1980; 287: 795-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (3055) Google Scholar). Molecular mechanisms of the Hh signal transduction have been intensively investigated using fly, fish, chick, and rodent models. Despite well described mechanisms of hh signaling in Drosophila, intracellular events induced by Sonic Hedgehog (Shh, one of three mammalian homologues of hh) have remained unclear in many aspects. Hedgehog carboxyl-terminal domain Fused activator form of Gli proteins repressor form of Gli2/3 protein immunoprecipitation kinase domain rat cerebellar granular cells Sonic Hedgehog Shh-LIGHT2 serine/threonine kinase 36 Suppressor of Fused unc-51-like kinase 3 Western blot wild-type Hedgehog signaling complex nucleotide. The Hh signaling is initiated by binding of the morphogen Hh to its receptor Patched1 (Ptch1), a 12-pass transmembrane protein. This results in the attenuation of the inhibitory effect of Ptch1 on another transmembrane protein, Smoothened (Smo), allowing the latter to transfer the signal into the cell through induction of the signaling machinery responsible for activation of the Hh target genes (3Ingham P.W. McMahon A.P. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 3059-3087Crossref PubMed Scopus (2504) Google Scholar). Initiation of the signaling occurring on the cell membrane is rather similar in invertebrates and vertebrates (5Varjosalo M. Li S.P. Taipale J. Dev. Cell. 2006; 10: 177-186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 6Huangfu D. Anderson K.V. Development. 2006; 133: 3-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). In vertebrates the Shh signal aims at controlling the activities of transcription factors Gli1, Gli2, and Gli3 (6Huangfu D. Anderson K.V. Development. 2006; 133: 3-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar, 7Jacob J. Briscoe J. EMBO Rep. 2003; 4: 761-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Gli1 is the strongest activator and the Gli1 gene is a transcriptional target of Shh activity. As Gli1 is generally not expressed in non-stimulated cells, it serves as a marker of Shh activity and is thought to contribute to the maintenance of signaling (8Bai C.B. Auerbach W. Lee J.S. Stephen D. Joyner A.L. Development. 2002; 129: 4753-4761Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 9Bai C.B. Joyner A.L. Development. 2001; 128: 5161-5172Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Both Gli2 and Gli3 contain an N-terminal repressor domain and a C-terminal activator domain, whereas Gli3 is the strongest repressor and Gli2 is a primary activator of the Shh target genes (10Sasaki H. Nishizaki Y. Hui C. Nakafuku M. Kondoh H. Development. 1999; 126: 3915-3924Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the absence of Shh, full-length Gli2 and Gli3 are subjected to proteosomal degradation or undergo partial proteolysis resulting in generation of C terminal-truncated repressor forms, Gli2/3Rep (11Wang B. Fallon J.F. Beachy P.A. Cell. 2000; 100: 423-434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (834) Google Scholar, 12Pan Y. Bai C.B. Joyner A.L. Wang B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 3365-3377Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). In Shh-stimulated cells the proteolysis is repressed and full-length Gli proteins are converted to transcriptional activators, GliAct, followed by their translocation to the nucleus where they take part in transcriptional activation of target genes. In fact, it has been suggested that the balance between activator and repressor forms of Gli proteins determines the transcriptional outcome (13Stecca B. Ruiz I.A.A. J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2010; 2: 84-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar, 14Ruiz i Altaba A. Mas C. Stecca B. Trends Cell.

Genetic studies suggest that the PEST domain containing protein Sufu is a major negative regulator of Gli proteins in mammals (15Cooper A.F. Yu K.P. Brueckner M. Brailey L.L. Johnson L. McGrath J.M.

Genetics. 1992; 132: 725-736Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), whereas Sufu-deficient mice die at 9.5 days post coitus with multiple defects resulting from abnormal up-regulation of Hh signaling (15Cooper A.F.

Mammalian Sufu controls Gli proteins by direct binding and sequestering them in the cytoplasm (18Ding Q. Fukami S. Meng X. Nishizaki Y. Zhang X. Sasaki H. Dlugosz A. Nakafuku M. Hui C. Curr.

This interaction is believed to contribute to the generation of Gli2/3Rep that is preceded by the phosphorylation of full-length Gli2/3 by PKA, glycogen synthase kinase 3β, and casein kinase 1 (12Pan Y. Bai C.B. Joyner A.L. Wang B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 3365-3377Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar, 21Pan Y. Wang C. Wang B. Dev.

Nature. 2002; 416: 548-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). However, recent findings have demonstrated that Sufu binding to full-length Gli2 and Gli3 protects them from complete proteosomal degradation, which in turn contributes to the accumulation of a pool of Gli2 and Gli3 proteins ready to be converted to transcriptional activators (25Chen M.H. Wilson C.W. Li Y.J. Law K.K. Lu C.S. Gacayan R. Zhang X. Hui C.C. Chuang P.T. Genes Dev. 2009; 23: 1910-1928Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). The dual function of Sufu suggests the existence of several pools of Sufu, regulating Gli proteins context dependently. In Drosophila, the divergent functions of Gli proteins are performed by one hh signal-dependent transcription factor, Cubitus interruptus (26Aza-Blanc P. Ramírez-Weber F.A. Laget M.P. Schwartz C. Kornberg T.B. Cell. 1997; 89: 1043-1053Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar). The activity of C. interruptus is controlled by a multimolecular complex associated with microtubules (so-called Hedgehog signaling complex or HSC). HSC contains a scaffolding protein costal2 (cos2), and putative serine/threonine kinase fused (fu), and sufu (27Monnier V. Dussillol F. Alves G. Lamour-Isnard C. Plessis A. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 583-586Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Lefers M.A. Wang Q.T. Holmgren R.A. Dev.

Chem. 2000; 275: 21809-21812Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). HSC, through cos2 and sufu, binds C. interruptus and controls its stability, subcellular localization, and activity in an hh signal-dependent way (31Ruel L. Rodriguez R. Gallet A. Lavenant-Staccini L. Thérond P.P. Nat. Cell. Biol. 2003; 5: 907-913Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 32Lum L. Zhang C. Oh S. Mann R.K. von Kessler D.P. Taipale J. Weis-Garcia F. Gong R. Wang B. Beachy P.A. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 1261-1274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). In the absence of hh ligand, HSC is responsible for retaining the full-length C. interruptus in an inactive state and also participates in the generation of a C-terminal-truncated repressor form of C. interruptus. In the hh-stimulated cells, HSC dissociates, and full-length C. interruptus is released to perform transcriptional activation. Fu is known as one of the central regulators of C. interruptus activity. Genetic studies suggest a positive role of fu, as loss of fu leads to Hh pathway activation (33Préat T. Thérond P. Lamour-Isnard C. Limbourg-Bouchon B. Tricoire H. Erk I. Mariol M.C. Busson D. Nature. 1990; 347: 87-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 34Préat T. Thérond P. Limbourg-Bouchon B. Pham A. Tricoire H. Busson D. Lamour-Isnard C. Genetics. 1993; 135: 1047-1062Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Indeed, the predominant role of fu is to antagonize the negative effect of sufu (35Pham A. Therond P. Alves G. Tournier F.B. Busson D. Lamour-Isnard C. Bouchon B.L. Préat T. Tricoire H. Genetics. 1995; 140: 587-598Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Fu and sufu are able to interact, and the fu domain responsible for this interaction has been mapped to amino acids residues 306–436 (27Monnier V. Dussillol F. Alves G. Lamour-Isnard C. Plessis A. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 583-586Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fu comprises an N-terminal kinase domain and a C-terminal regulatory domain and has been shown to play both kinase activity-dependent and -independent (regulatory) roles (36Thérond P. Alves G.

Mech. Dev. 1998; 78: 17-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). In the absence of hh ligand, fu is inactive and subjected to autoinhibition through its regulatory domain (39Ascano Jr., M. Robbins D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 10397-10405Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). This domain is also required for processing of full-length C. interruptus into the transcriptional repressor form (37Ascano Jr., M. Nybakken K.E. Sosinski J. Stegman M.A. Robbins D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 1555-1566Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). However, when the pathway is activated, fu becomes phosphorylated (40Thérond P.P. Knight J.D. Kornberg T.B. Bishop J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1996; 93: 4224-4228Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Moreover, it has been shown that phosphorylation of cos2, sufu, and smo in response to the pathway activation depends on fu kinase activity and full activation of the hh pathway requires fu kinase (28Lefers M.A. Wang Q.T. Holmgren R.A. Dev. Biol. 2001; 236: 411-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 31Ruel L. Rodriguez R. Gallet A. Lavenant-Staccini L. Thérond P.P. Nat. Cell.

At present, a similar Gli-containing signaling complex has not been described in vertebrates. In contrast to the comprehensive role of fu, its mammalian homologue Stk36 has no or a limited role in the Shh pathway, as it is dispensable for proper embryonic development in mouse (44Merchant M.

Although Stk36 was shown to some extent rescue the negative effect of Sufu on Gli-dependent transcription (46Murone M. Luoh S.M. Stone D. Li W. Gurney A. Armanini M. Grey C. Rosenthal A. de Sauvage F.J. Nat. Cell. Biol. 2000; 2: 310-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), no evidence of physical interaction between Sufu and Stk36 has been provided. Recently, we have demonstrated that serine/threonine kinase ULK3 is able to regulate GLI proteins positively in a kinase activity-dependent manner (47Maloverjan A. Piirsoo M. Michelson P. Kogerman P. Osterlund T. Exp. Cell. Res. 2010; 316: 627-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). ULK3 shares sequence similarity with serine/threonine kinases fu and STK36. We have shown that ULK3 directly phosphorylates GLI proteins, enhances their transcriptional activity in cell culture, and promotes the nuclear translocation of GLI1. In this study, we demonstrate that ULK3 kinase has a intramolecular self-regulation property. In addition to the previously demonstrated phosphorylation/activation of GLI, ULK3 has a kinase-independent regulatory role in the SHH pathway. By RNAi, it is demonstrated that reduction of the Ulk3 mRNA level results in a higher response of cells to the Shh signal. We show that ULK3 through its kinase domain (KD) physically interacts with SUFU, and that the ULK3-Sufu complex is sensitive to SHH signaling. Interaction with Sufu inhibits the catalytic activity of ULK3, preventing its autophosphorylation and subsequent phosphorylation of GLI proteins. Moreover, the SUFU-ULK3 complex, when co-expressed with GLI2, induces generation of the GLI2 repressor form, whereas none of those proteins alone is able to do that. Finally, we propose a model unraveling the role of Ulk3 in the regulation of Gli proteins. ULK3FLAG, ULK3(K139R), and GLI2FLAG were described in Ref. 47Maloverjan A. Piirsoo M. Michelson P.

Approximately 24 h prior to transfections or induction with SHH, the cells were plated onto appropriate growth dishes. Rat cerebellar granular cells (RCGCs) were isolated from P6 rat pups, as described (51Rieff H.I. Raetzman L.T. Sapp D.W. Yeh H.H. Siegel R.E. Corfas G. J.

Cells were propagated in Neurobasal medium supplemented with B-27 (Invitrogen), 78 ng/ml of d-glucose, 20 mm KCl (Sigma), 20 μm glutamine, and 100 μg/ml of penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen). All cells were grown at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Shh-L2 cells and stable cell lines derived from Shh-L2, HEK293, and NIH3T3 cells were transfected using polyethylenimine transfection agent (PEI) (Inbio, Tallinn, Estonia) as described (50Maloveryan A. Finta C. Osterlund T. Kogerman P. J. Cell. Commun. Signal. 2007; 1: 165-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). After transfection, HEK293 and NIH3T3 cells were propagated in the normal growth medium for 48 h. Shh-L2 cells were handled as previously described and subjected to luciferase assay (50Maloveryan A. Finta C. Osterlund T. Kogerman P. J. Cell. Commun. Signal. 2007; 1: 165-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The obtained firefly luciferase data were normalized with β-galactosidase values. For assessment of efficiency of siRNAs, HEK293 cells were co-transfected with the Ulk3FLAG construct, pCI-GFP plasmid, and either siRNA1pSUPER or siRNA2pSUPER constructs (40 + 40 ng + 1500 ng/3-cm plate, respectively). Stable cell clones were co-transfected with 100 ng of Ulk3FLAG and 50 ng of pCI-GFP on a 3-cm plate. RCGCs were transfected using Amaxa Rat Neuron Nucleofector kit (Lonza, Basel, Switzerland) according to the manufacturer's instructions. We used 2 μg of plasmid per ∼2 ml of RCGCs. For detection of the GLI2 repressor form, HEK293 cells were transfected with 1 μg of GLI2GFP, 0.6 μg of ULK3FLAG or ULK3(K139R), and 0.4 μg of SUFUmyc plasmids or the respective empty vectors. Alternatively, the FLAG-tagged GLI2 construct was used in combination with His-tagged ULK3 and SUFUmyc encoding plasmids. Cells were incubated 48 h, lysed using RIPA lysis buffer supplemented with Protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science), and subjected to WB using anti-GFP antibody or M2 anti-FLAG antibody. Total RNA from Shh-L2 and stable cell lines was isolated using RNAqueous kit (Ambion, Austin, TX) and total RNA from RCGC was isolated using the RNeasy micro kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. cDNA was synthesized from 1 μg of total RNA using SuperScriptIII reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. The levels of Ulk3 and Gli1 mRNAs and mRNA of the housekeeping gene Hprt used for normalization were detected in triplicates by quantitative real time PCR (qRT-PCR) using qPCR Core kit for SYBR Green (Eurogentec, Seraing, Belgium) with Lightcycler 2.0 (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Data were analyzed with Lightcycler 4.05 software (Roche). The data are expressed as the average mean ± S.E. of three independent measurements. The following primers were used: Ulk3 sense, 5′-ACGAAACATCTCTCACTTG-3′; Ulk3 antisense, 5′-TGCTGGGCAAAGCCAAAGTC-3′; Gli1 sense, 5′-ACGTTTGAAGGCTGTCGGAA-3′; Gli1 antisense, 5′-CACACGTATGGCTTCTCATT-3′; Hprt sense, 5′-CAGTCCCAGCGTCGTGATTA-3′; and Hprt antisense, 5′-AGCAAGTCTTTCAGTCCTGTC-3′. Statistical analysis was carried out and p values were calculated using t test (Two Sample Assuming Equal Variances). Cells were lysed and immunoprecipitation (IP) was performed as previously described (47Maloverjan A. Piirsoo M. Michelson P. Kogerman P. Osterlund T. Exp. Cell. Res. 2010; 316: 627-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). HEK293 cells were transfected with FLAG-tagged constructs expressing ULK3, ULK3(K139R), ULK3(Δ301–365), ULK3(Δ373–446), or ULK3-KD and the myc-tagged construct expressing SUFU (each 2.5 μg) on 6-cm plates. For negative controls, expression constructs were substituted with the respective empty vectors. FLAG-tagged constructs were immunoprecipitated using anti-FLAG-M2 affinity gel and myc-tagged SUFU was precipitated using anti-myc affinity gel according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cell lysates were incubated with the antibodies for 2 h at room temperature with gentle agitation. Immunocomplexes were subjected to WB using M2 anti-FLAG-HRP antibody and H-300 anti-myc antibody. Endogenous Sufu was immunoprecipitated from NIH3T3 cells using C-15 anti-Sufu antibody conjugated with agarose beads. Cells were transiently transfected with 10 μg of ULK3FLAG or empty vector and, if indicated, induced with 12 nm SHH for 48 h on 10-cm plates. Cell lysates were incubated with the antibody overnight at 4 °C with gentle agitation. Immunocomplexes were subjected to WB using H-300 anti-Sufu antibody or M2 anti-FLAG-HRP antibody. In vitro kinase assay was performed as described (47Maloverjan A. Piirsoo M. Michelson P. Kogerman P. Osterlund T. Exp. Cell. Res. 2010; 316: 627-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Briefly, FLAG-tagged ULK3, ULK3(K139R), ULK3-KD, ULK3-CT, and GLI2FLAG proteins were overexpressed in HEK293 cells, immunoprecipitated using anti-FLAG-M2 affinity gel, washed 3 times with TBS, 2 times with kinase buffer and resuspended in 30 μl of kinase buffer. Aliquots of 2 μl were used for in vitro kinase assay. One-half of the myc immunocomplexes was washed twice with kinase buffer and subjected to in vitro kinase assay in the presence of ULK3-Ubi and separately immunopurified FLAG-tagged ULK3, if indicated. For detection of ULK3 autophosphorylation sites, ULK3FLAG and ULK3(K139R) were expressed in HEK293 cells. The proteins were immunopurified using anti-FLAG-M2 affinity gel. ULK3FLAG and ULK3-Ubi proteins were subjected to in vitro kinase assay. The reaction was stopped by adding Laemmli buffer containing 100 mm DTT. ULK3FLAG protein, not subjected to the in vitro kinase assay, was used as a control. Proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and visualized by Coomassie Blue staining. The bands were excised from the gel and in-gel digested with modified sequencing grade trypsin (Promega), as described previously (52Hellman U. Exs. 2000; 88: 43-54PubMed Google Scholar). Peptides from in-gel-digested samples were purified with StageTips1 and analyzed by LC-MS/MS using an Agilent 1200 series nanoflow system (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA) connected to a LTQ Orbitrap mass spectrometer (Thermo Electron, Bremen, Germany) equipped with a nanoelectrospray ion source (Proxeon, Odense, Denmark). Up to five data-dependent MS/MS spectra were acquired in centroid in the linear ion trap for each FTMS full-scan spectrum. Fragment MS/MS spectra from raw files were extracted as MSM files and then merged to peak lists using Raw2MSM version 1.72 selecting the top six peaks for 100 Da. MSM files were searched with the Mascot 2.2 search engine (Matrix Science, London, UK) against the protein sequence data base composed of ULK3 sequences and common contaminant proteins such as trypsin, keratins etc. To investigate the role of Ulk3 in Shh signal transduction, we suppressed Ulk3 expression by RNAi. We designed two siRNA-expressing constructs, siRNA1pSUPER and siRNA2pSUPER. The effectiveness of the siRNAs was estimated by overexpressing Ulk3FLAG with siRNA1pSUPER and siRNA2pSUPER constructs in HEK293 cells. pCI-GFP plasmid expressing GFP was co-transfected to estimate the efficiency of transfection. Expression of FLAG-tagged Ulk3 and GFP was detected by WB analysis using anti-FLAG and anti-GFP antibodies, respectively. The experiment was repeated three times and the data of a representative experiment are shown in Fig. 1"
https://openalex.org/W1984143549,"The E1B-55K product from human adenovirus is a substrate of the small ubiquitin-related modifier (SUMO)-conjugation system. SUMOylation of E1B-55K is required to transform primary mammalian cells in cooperation with adenovirus E1A and to repress p53 tumour suppressor functions. The biochemical consequences of SUMO1 conjugation of 55K have so far remained elusive. Here, we report that E1B-55K physically interacts with different isoforms of the tumour suppressor protein promyelocytic leukaemia (PML). We show that E1B-55K binds to PML isoforms IV and V in a SUMO1-dependent and -independent manner. Interaction with PML-IV promotes the localization of 55K to PML-containing subnuclear structures (PML-NBs). In virus-infected cells, this process is negatively regulated by other viral proteins, indicating that binding to PML is controlled through reversible SUMOylation in a timely coordinated manner. These results together with earlier work are consistent with the idea that SUMOylation regulates targeting of E1B-55K to PML-NBs, known to control transcriptional regulation, tumour suppression, DNA repair and apoptosis. Furthermore, they suggest that SUMO1-dependent modulation of p53-dependent growth suppression through E1B-55K PML-IV interaction has a key role in adenovirus-mediated cell transformation."
https://openalex.org/W2046185911,"Menin encoded by the multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1) gene is associated with chromatin and the nuclear matrix and exerts multiple biological functions including regulation of cell proliferation and adhesion. Men1 mutations increase the likelihood of lung cancer development in mice. Menin expression is reduced in certain human non-small cell lung cancer cells, and reduction of menin is closely correlated with increased lung cancer metastasis to lymph nodes. However, it is poorly understood whether menin affects migration of lung cancer cells. In this study, we show that menin-regulated A549 lung cancer cell migration, which was mediated by growth factor pleiotrophin (PTN) and its cell surface receptor, protein tyrosine phosphatase beta/zeta (RPTP β/ζ). Ectopic menin expression significantly repressed PTN transcription, but indirectly inhibited RPTP β/ζ expression through repressing PTN expression. Further studies revealed that menin-regulated cell migration through PTN/RPTP β/ζ, in conjunction with integrin αvβ3, focal adhesion kinase, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and phosphorylated extracellular signal regulated kinase 1/2. These findings provide mechanistic insights into the molecular basis for menin/PTN-mediated regulation of A549 lung cancer cell migration."
https://openalex.org/W2080379364,"Background Cholera toxin (CT) and toxin-co-regulated pili (TCP) are the major virulence factors of Vibrio cholerae O1 and O139 strains that contribute to the pathogenesis of disease during devastating cholera pandemics. However, CT and TCP negative V. cholerae strains are still able to cause severe diarrheal disease in humans through mechanisms that are not well understood. Methodology/Principal Findings To determine the role of other virulence factors in V. cholerae pathogenesis, we used a CT and TCP independent infection model in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans and identified the hemolysin A (hlyA) gene as a factor responsible for animal death and developmental delay. We demonstrated a correlation between the severity of infection in the nematode and the level of hemolytic activity in the V. cholerae biotypes. At the cellular level, V. cholerae infection induces formation of vacuoles in the intestinal cells in a hlyA dependent manner, consistent with the previous in vitro observations. Conclusions/Significance Our data strongly suggest that HlyA is a virulence factor in C. elegans infection leading to lethality and developmental delay presumably through intestinal cytopathic changes."
https://openalex.org/W2145299570,"The prolactin receptor (PRLR), its associated Janus kinase 2 (Jak2) and the signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 (Stat5) are essential for normal mammary gland development. Owing to the upregulation of the PRLR and the local synthesis of its ligand in neoplastic cells, it has been proposed that PRL can act as a local growth factor in human breast cancers. This notion is supported by experimental evidence in transgenic mice, which showed that the mammary-specific expression of PRL contributes to carcinogenesis in vivo. To assess the importance of Jak2/Stat5 signaling during mammary cancer initiation and progression, we generated a PRL-induced mammary cancer model that allows the functional ablation of the Jak2 gene in the mammary epithelium before and after neoplastic transformation. Collectively, the results of this study show that the functional ablation of Jak2 protects against the onset of PRL-induced mammary tumorigenesis, suggesting that targeting this kinase is a relevant strategy for mammary cancer prevention. Surprisingly, Jak2 deficiency did not affect the growth and survival of PRL-induced mammary cancer cells in culture and in vivo. Consequently, Jak2 cannot be a sole therapeutic target to treat the established disease. PRL-induced mammary cancers exhibited an upregulation of ErbB2 and other ErbB receptor tyrosine kinases that may supersede the functionality of PRLR signaling through Jak2."
https://openalex.org/W1968862404,"Walker-Warburg syndrome, a progressive muscular dystrophy, is a severe disease with various kinds of symptoms such as muscle weakness and occasional seizures. The genes of protein O-mannosyltransferases 1 and 2 (POMT1 and POMT2), fukutin, and fukutin-related protein are responsible for this syndrome. In our previous study, we cloned Drosophila orthologs of human POMT1 and POMT2 and identified their activity. However, the mechanism of onset of this syndrome is not well understood. Furthermore, little is known about the behavioral properties of the Drosophila POMT1 and POMT2 mutants, which are called rotated abdomen (rt) and twisted (tw), respectively. First, we performed various kinds of behavioral tests and described in detail the muscle structures by using these mutants. The mutant flies exhibited abnormalities in heavy exercises such as climbing or flight but not in light movements such as locomotion. Defective motor function in mutants appeared immediately after eclosion and was exaggerated with aging. Along with motor function, muscle ultrastructure in the tw mutant was altered, as seen in human patients. We demonstrated that expression of RNA interference (RNAi) for the rt gene and the tw mutant was almost completely lethal and semi-lethal, respectively. Flies expressing RNAi had reduced lifespans. These findings clearly demonstrate that Drosophila POMT mutants are models for human muscular dystrophy. We then observed a high density of myoblasts with an enhanced degree of apoptosis in the tw mutant, which completely lost enzymatic activity. In this paper, we propose a novel mechanism for the development of muscular dystrophy: POMT mutation causes high myoblast density and position derangement, which result in apoptosis, muscle disorganization, and muscle cell defects."

Eukaryotic-type Ser/Thr kinases reported in prokaryotes, including that in group A Streptococcus (GAS) (Streptococcus pyogenes Ser/Thr kinase (SP-STK)), regulate cell division, growth, and virulence. The mechanism of this regulation is, however, unknown. In this study, we demonstrated that SP-STK-controlled cell division is mediated under the positive regulation of secretory protein that possesses a cysteine and histidine-dependent aminohydrolases/peptidases (CHAP) domain with functionally active cell wall hydrolase activity (henceforth named as CdhA (CHAP-domain-containing and chain-forming cell wall hydrolase). Deletion of the CdhA-encoding gene resulted in severe cell division and growth defects in GAS mutants. The mutant expressing the truncated CdhA (devoid of the CHAP domain), although displayed no such defects, it became attenuated for virulence in mice and highly susceptible to cell wall-acting antibiotics, as observed for the mutant lacking CdhA. When CdhA was overexpressed in the wild-type GAS as well as in heterologous strains, Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus, we observed a distinct increase in bacterial chain length. Our data reveal that CdhA is a multifunctional protein with a major function of the N-terminal region as a cell division plane-recognizing domain and that of the C-terminal CHAP domain as a virulence-regulating domain.

https://openalex.org/W2110406916,"Regeneration of spinal cord injury (SCI) is a major topic of biomedical research. Laminin is an extracellular matrix protein implicated in neural development and regeneration, but despite that, there are no reports of exogenous laminin contributing to improve the outcome of experimental SCI. Here we investigated whether a biomimetic polymer of laminin assembled on pH acidification, henceforth called polylaminin, could be used to treat SCI in rats. Acute local injection of polylaminin, but not of nonpolymerized laminin, improved motor function after thoracic compression, partial or complete transection. In the latter case, the BBB score for open field locomotion 8 wk after lesion increased from 4.2 ± 0.48 to 8.8 ± 1.14 in animals treated with polylaminin of human origin. Accordingly, neurons retrogradely labeled from the sublesion stump were detected in the spinal cord and brain stem, indicating regrowth of short and long fibers across a complete transection. Polylaminin also played an unsuspected anti-inflammatory role, which underlies the early onset of its positive effects on locomotion from the first week after treatment. The beneficial effects of polylaminin were not observed in animals treated with the nonpolymerized protein or vehicle only.

https://openalex.org/W2019155664,"1,4-Dihydroxy-2-naphthoyl coenzyme A (DHNA-CoA) synthase is a typical crotonase-fold protein catalyzing an intramolecular Claisen condensation in the menaquinone biosynthetic pathway. We have characterized this enzyme from Escherichia coli and found that it is activated by bicarbonate in a concentration-dependent manner. The bicarbonate binding site has been identified in the crystal structure of a virtually identical ortholog (96.8% sequence identity) from Salmonella typhimurium through comparison with a bicarbonate-insensitive orthologue. Kinetic properties of the enzyme and its site-directed mutants of the bicarbonate binding site indicate that the exogenous bicarbonate anion is essential to the enzyme activity. With this essential catalytic role, the simple bicarbonate anion is an enzyme cofactor, which is usually a small organic molecule derived from vitamins, a metal ion, or a metal-containing polyatomic anionic complex. This finding leads to classification of the DHNA-CoA synthases into two evolutionarily conserved subfamilies: type I enzymes that are bicarbonate-dependent and contain a conserved glycine at the bicarbonate binding site; and type II enzymes that are bicarbonate-independent and contain a conserved aspartate at the position similar to the enzyme-bound bicarbonate. In addition, the unique location of the enzyme-bound bicarbonate allows it to be proposed as a catalytic base responsible for abstraction of the α-proton of the thioester substrate in the enzymatic reaction, suggesting a unified catalytic mechanism for all DHNA-CoA synthases."
https://openalex.org/W2104218845,"Background The Thr allele at the non-synonymous single-nucleotide polymorphism (nsSNP) Thr946Ala in the IFIH1 gene confers risk for Type 1 diabetes (T1D). The SNP is embedded in a 236 kb linkage disequilibrium (LD) block that includes four genes: IFIH1, GCA, FAP and KCNH7. The absence of common nsSNPs in the other genes makes the IFIH1 SNP the strongest functional candidate, but it could be merely a marker of association, due to LD with a variant regulating expression levels of IFIH1 or neighboring genes. Methodology/Principal Findings We investigated the effect of the T1D-associated variation on mRNA transcript expression of these genes. Heterozygous mRNA from lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs), pancreas and thymus was examined by allelic expression imbalance, to detect effects in cis on mRNA expression. Using single-nucleotide primer extension, we found no difference between mRNA transcripts in 9 LCLs, 6 pancreas and 13 thymus samples, suggesting that GCA and FAP are not involved. On the other hand, KCNH7 was not expressed at a detectable level in all tissues examined. Moreover, the association of the Thr946Ala SNP with T1D is not due to modulation of IFIH1 expression in organs involved in the disease, pointing to the IFIH1 nsSNP as the causal variant. Conclusions/Significance The mechanism of the association of the nsSNP with T1D remains to be determined, but does not involve mRNA modulation. It becomes necessary to study differential function of the IFIH1 protein alleles at Thr946Ala to confirm that it is responsible for the disease association."
https://openalex.org/W1976515437,"Acidic phospholipids increase the affinity of the plasma membrane Ca2+-ATPase pump for Ca2+. They interact with the C-terminal region of the pump and with a domain in the loop connecting transmembrane domains 2 and 3 (AL region) next to site A of alternative splicing. The contribution of the two phospholipid-binding sites and the possible interference of splicing inserts at site A with the regulation of the ATPase activity of isoform 2 of the pump by phospholipids have been analyzed. The activity of the full-length z/b variant (no insert at site A), the w/b (with insert at site A), and the w/a variant, containing both the 45-amino acid A-site insert and a C-site insert that truncates the pump in the calmodulin binding domain, has been analyzed in microsomal membranes of overexpressing CHO cells. The A-site insertion did not modify the phospholipid sensitivity of the pump, but the doubly inserted w/a variant became insensitive to acidic phospholipids, even if containing the intact AL phospholipid binding domain. Pump mutants in which 12 amino acids had been deleted, or single lysine mutations introduced, in the AL region were studied by monitoring agonist-induced Ca2+ transients in overexpressing CHO cells. The 12-residue deletion completely abolished the ATPase activity of the w/a variant but only reduced that of the z/b variant, which was also affected by the single lysine substitutions in the same domain. A structural interpretation of the interplay of the pump with phospholipids, and of the mechanism of their activation, is proposed on the basis of molecular modeling studies. Acidic phospholipids increase the affinity of the plasma membrane Ca2+-ATPase pump for Ca2+. They interact with the C-terminal region of the pump and with a domain in the loop connecting transmembrane domains 2 and 3 (AL region) next to site A of alternative splicing.

The activity of the full-length z/b variant (no insert at site A), the w/b (with insert at site A), and the w/a variant, containing both the 45-amino acid A-site insert and a C-site insert that truncates the pump in the calmodulin binding domain, has been analyzed in microsomal membranes of overexpressing CHO cells. The A-site insertion did not modify the phospholipid sensitivity of the pump, but the doubly inserted w/a variant became insensitive to acidic phospholipids, even if containing the intact AL phospholipid binding domain. Pump mutants in which 12 amino acids had been deleted, or single lysine mutations introduced, in the AL region were studied by monitoring agonist-induced Ca2+ transients in overexpressing CHO cells. The 12-residue deletion completely abolished the ATPase activity of the w/a variant but only reduced that of the z/b variant, which was also affected by the single lysine substitutions in the same domain. A structural interpretation of the interplay of the pump with phospholipids, and of the mechanism of their activation, is proposed on the basis of molecular modeling studies."
https://openalex.org/W2036006408,"Terminally differentiated (TD) cells permanently exit the mitotic cycle while acquiring specialized characteristics. Although TD cells can be forced to reenter the cell cycle by different means, they cannot be made to stably proliferate, as attempts to induce their replication constantly result in cell death or indefinite growth arrest. There is currently no biological explanation for this failure.Here we show that TD mouse myotubes, reactivated by depletion of the p21 and p27 cell cycle inhibitors, are unable to complete DNA replication and sustain heavy DNA damage, which triggers apoptosis or results in mitotic catastrophe. In striking contrast, quiescent, non-TD fibroblasts and myoblasts, reactivated in the same way, fully replicate their DNA, do not suffer DNA damage, and proliferate even in the absence of growth factors. Similar results are obtained when myotubes and fibroblasts are reactivated by forced expression of E1A or cyclin D1 and cdk4.We conclude that the inability of myotubes to complete DNA replication must be ascribed to peculiar features inherent in their TD state, rather than to the reactivation method. On reviewing the literature concerning reactivation of other TD cell types, we propose that similar mechanisms underlie the general inability of all kinds of TD cells to proliferate in response to otherwise mitogenic stimuli. These results define an unexpected basis for the well known incompetence of mammalian postmitotic cells to proliferate. Furthermore, this trait might contribute to explain the inability of these cells to play a role in tissue repair, unlike their counterparts in extensively regenerating species."
https://openalex.org/W1997856733,"Background The recommended interval between updates for systematic reviews included in The Cochrane Library is 2 years. However, it is unclear whether this interval is always appropriate. Whereas excessive updating wastes time and resources, insufficient updating allows out-of-date or incomplete evidence to guide clinical decision-making. We set out to determine, for Cochrane pregnancy and childbirth reviews, the frequency of updates, factors associated with updating, and whether updating frequency was appropriate. Methodology/Principal Findings Cochrane pregnancy and childbirth reviews published in Issue 3, 2007 of the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews were retrieved, and data were collected from their original and updated versions. Quantitative changes were determined for one of the primary outcomes (mortality, or the outcome of greatest clinical significance). Potential factors associated with time to update were assessed using the Cox proportional hazard model. Among the 101 reviews in our final sample, the median time before the first update was 3.3 years (95% CI 2.7–3.8). Only 32.7% had been updated within the recommended interval of 2 years. In 75.3% (76/101), a median of 3 new trials with a median of 576 additional participants were included in the updated versions. There were quantitative changes in 71% of the reviews that included new trials (54/76): the median change in effect size was 18.2%, and the median change in 95% CI width was 30.8%. Statistical significance changed in 18.5% (10/54) of these reviews, but conclusions were revised in only 3.7% (2/54). A shorter time to update was associated with the same original review team at updating. Conclusions/Significance Most reviews were updated less frequently than recommended by Cochrane policy, but few updates had revised conclusions. Prescribed time to update should be reconsidered to support improved decision-making while making efficient use of limited resources."

To determine how such structures are resolved, we have defined biochemical activities of the related RAD2 family nucleases, FEN1 (Flap endonuclease 1) and EXO1 (exonuclease 1), on substrates that recapitulate intermediates in DNA replication. Here, we show that, consistent with its function in lagging strand replication, human (h) FEN1 could cleave 5′-flaps bearing structures formed by CTG or CGG repeats, although less efficiently than unstructured flaps. hEXO1 did not exhibit endonuclease activity on 5′-flaps bearing structures formed by CTG or CGG repeats, although it could excise these substrates. Neither hFEN1 nor hEXO1 was affected by the stem-loops formed by CTG repeats interrupting duplex regions adjacent to 5′-flaps, but both enzymes were inhibited by G4 structures formed by CGG repeats in analogous positions. Hydroxyl radical footprinting showed that hFEN1 binding caused hypersensitivity near the flap/duplex junction, whereas hEXO1 binding caused hypersensitivity very close to the 5′-end, correlating with the predominance of hFEN1 endonucleolytic activity versus hEXO1 exonucleolytic activity on 5′-flap substrates.

IntroductionShort tandem nucleotide repeats are widespread in mammalian genomes (1Tóth G. Gáspári Z. Jurka J. Genome Res. 2000; 10: 967-981Crossref PubMed Scopus (1068) Google Scholar) and prone to instability because of their potential to form alternative structures during replication, transcription, or recombination. Trinucleotide repeats are of particular interest because they are associated with at least 20 human neurodegenerative disorders (2Orr H.T. Zoghbi H.Y. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2007; 30: 575-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (1072) Google Scholar). Fragile X syndrome, the second most common cause of mental retardation, is caused by CGG repeat expansion; myotonic dystrophy by CTG repeat expansion; and Huntington chorea by CAG repeat expansions (3Moore H.

All three repeats can form stable secondary structures containing stem-loops or, in the case of the CGG repeat, G4 DNA (4McMurray C.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Formation of secondary structures can affect DNA replication, and factors that promote Okazaki fragment maturation and lagging strand synthesis have been identified as critical to maintenance of repeat stability (7Hou C.

Lieber M.R. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1344-1355Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). The canonical activity of FEN1 is endonucleolytic excision of a 5′-flap from a duplex substrate, which represents the intermediate in processing Okazaki fragments during lagging strand replication (15Liu Y. Kao H.I. Bambara R.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73: 589-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). FEN1 can also function as an exonuclease and gap endonuclease.

Yeast deficient in Rad27, the FEN1 homolog, exhibits growth defects; mutagenesis; and increased instability of CGG, CTG, and CAG repeats (8Daee D.L. Mertz T. Lahue R.S. Mol. Cell.

Freudenreich C.H. Gene. 2007; 393: 110-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), consistent with a role for FEN1 in stabilizing regions containing triplet repeats. Like FEN1, EXO1 is a conserved RAD2 family nuclease that possesses both 5′-flap endonuclease and exonucleolytic activities and has important functions in replication, repair, and recombination (14Harrington J.J. Lieber M.R. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1344-1355Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar, 19Lee B.I. Wilson 3rd, D.M. J. Biol.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 3762-3768Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Genetic analysis suggests that the activities of EXO1 and FEN1 might be partially redundant, as overexpression of Exo1 is able to rescue the mutator phenotype of yeast rad27 (21Sun X. Thrower D. Qiu J. Wu P. Zheng L. Zhou M. Bachant J. Wilson 3rd, D.M. Shen B. DNA Repair. 2003; 2: 925-940Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), whereas rad27Δ is synthetic lethal when combined with exo1Δ in yeast (22Tishkoff D.X. Boerger A.L. Bertrand P. Filosi N. Gaida G.M. Kane M.F. Kolodner R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

EXO1 acts on flap substrates and transcribed substrates containing G4 DNA (23Vallur A.C. Maizels N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 16508-16512Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 24Vallur A.C. Maizels N. PLoS One. 2010; 5e8908Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). This prompted us to compare the activities of purified hEXO1 and hFEN1 on substrates recapitulating replication intermediates bearing CTG or CGG repeats. We found that hFEN1 cleaved 5′-flaps bearing structures formed by CTG or CGG repeats, consistent with its function in lagging strand replication. hEXO1 excised these flaps but did not cleave them endonucleolytically. Cleavage by both hFEN1 and hEXO1 was reduced on flap substrates bearing CGG repeats, which form G4 DNA, relative to CTG repeats, which form stem-loops. The hydroxyl radical footprinting patterns of hFEN1 and hEXO1 correlated with the relative predominance of flap cleavage and excision: hFEN1 binding caused hypersensitivity at the flap/duplex junction, whereas hEXO1 binding caused hypersensitivity at the very 5′-end of the flap. These results identify a novel and potentially important role for EXO1 in maintenance of stability of triplet repeats during replication and extend the repertoire of structures on which EXO1 can function to include stem-loops in addition to G4 DNA.DISCUSSIONWe have defined the activities of hFEN1 and hEXO1 that may contribute to stabilizing structures formed by triplet repeats in the course of replication. We showed that both hFEN1 and hEXO1 can digest 5′-flap substrates that recapitulate intermediates in lagging strand DNA replication. Substrate structure determines whether digestion proceeds by an endonucleolytic or exonucleolytic pathway. The presence of a stem-loop (formed by a CTG repeat) in the flap diminished but did not prevent digestion and caused excision to predominate relative to endonucleolytic cleavage. The presence of G4 DNA (formed by a CGG repeat) in the flap further impaired digestion by hFEN1 and almost completely inhibited digestion by hEXO1. Flap digestion by hEXO1 (but not hFEN1) was also inhibited by G4 DNA interrupting the duplex region 3′ of the flap. Thus, whereas EXO1 may be redundant with FEN1 for some functions in replication, FEN1 may be especially critical for stability of regions bearing the G4 motif.Hydroxyl radical footprinting defined distinct modes of enzyme/substrate interaction for hEXO1 and hFEN1, which correlated with the predominance of endonucleolytic cleavage or excision. hEXO1 excised a substrate bearing an unstructured 5′-flap and induced hypersensitivity near the 5′-end upon binding. hEXO1 has been reported to protect a duplex region near the base of a flap upon binding to a dumbbell-shaped 41-mer substrate with a very short (5 nt) 5′-flap (26Lee B.I. Nguyen L.H. Barsky D. Fernandes M. Wilson 3rd, D.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 942-949Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), but we did not observe protection within the duplex region; differences in substrate structure probably explain these different footprints. hFEN1 cleaved a substrate bearing an unstructured 5′-flap at the flap/duplex junction and induced hypersensitivity at this junction upon binding. Similar results have been observed by micrococcal nuclease footprinting of the bovine FEN1 homolog, RTH1, on a similar substrate (30Barnes C.J. Wahl A.F. Shen B. Park M.S. Bambara R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29624-29631Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar).hFEN1 binding to a substrate bearing a stem-loop interrupting the duplex region adjacent to a flap similarly caused hypersensitivity at the flap/duplex junction. In contrast, hFEN1 binding to a substrate containing a stem-loop within the 5′-flap induced hypersensitivity very near the 5′-end. These different footprints correlate with the relative predominance of endonucleolytic cleavage or excision on these two substrates.FEN1 has been postulated to recognize a free 5′-end of a flap and then track along the flap to find the junction with duplex DNA, where it cleaves (31Henricksen L.A.

Chem. 1995; 270: 30377-30383Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). This model derived in part from evidence that the activity of the bovine FEN1 homolog, RTH1, is inhibited by bulky adducts such as streptavidin-bound biotin and double-stranded DNA in the 5′-flap, although not by small adducts such as biotin (32Murante R.S. Rust L. Bambara R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30377-30383Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). If tracking does occur, then the evidence that hFEN1 predominantly excised a substrate bearing a stem-loop would suggest that this structure may impede tracking. However, hFEN1 flap cleavage was only modestly affected by a (CGG)6 repeat within the 5′-flap and was unaffected by a G4 DNA structure formed by telomeric repeats at the very 5′-end of a flap (24Vallur A.C. Maizels N. PLoS One. 2010; 5e8908Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Thus, if tracking does occur, then not all 5′-adducts or 5′-structures inhibit FEN1 tracking. In particular, FEN1 might process substrates bearing G4 DNA differently from substrates bearing other structures.G4 DNA May Impair Post-replicative DNA ProcessingStrikingly, G4 DNA formed by CGG repeats inhibited both hFEN1 and hEXO1. Factors other than FEN1 and EXO1 are therefore likely to be required to resolve G4 DNA in vivo, possibly including G4 DNA helicases such as human BLM, WRN, and FANCJ (33Sun H. Karow J.K. Hickson I.D.

Trinucleotide repeats are of particular interest because they are associated with at least 20 human neurodegenerative disorders (2Orr H.T. Zoghbi H.Y. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2007; 30: 575-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (1072) Google Scholar). Fragile X syndrome, the second most common cause of mental retardation, is caused by CGG repeat expansion; myotonic dystrophy by CTG repeat expansion; and Huntington chorea by CAG repeat expansions (3Moore H. Greenwell P.W. Liu C.P. Arnheim N. Petes T.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1999; 96: 1504-1509Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). All three repeats can form stable secondary structures containing stem-loops or, in the case of the CGG repeat, G4 DNA (4McMurray C.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1999; 96: 1823-1825Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 5Fry M. Loeb L.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1994; 91: 4950-4954Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar, 6Kovtun I.V. Goellner G. McMurray C.T. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2001; 79: 325-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Formation of secondary structures can affect DNA replication, and factors that promote Okazaki fragment maturation and lagging strand synthesis have been identified as critical to maintenance of repeat stability (7Hou C. Chan N.L. Gu L. Li G.M. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2009; 16: 869-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 8Daee D.L. Mertz T. Lahue R.S. Mol. Cell.

FEN1 (Flap endonuclease 1) is a highly conserved RAD2 family nuclease active in DNA repair and a component of the replisome in eukaryotic cells (14Harrington J.J. Lieber M.R. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1344-1355Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). The canonical activity of FEN1 is endonucleolytic excision of a 5′-flap from a duplex substrate, which represents the intermediate in processing Okazaki fragments during lagging strand replication (15Liu Y. Kao H.I. Bambara R.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73: 589-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). FEN1 can also function as an exonuclease and gap endonuclease. FEN1 is essential in mammalian cells (16Larsen E. Gran C. Saether B.E. Seeberg E. Klungland A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 5346-5353Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Yeast deficient in Rad27, the FEN1 homolog, exhibits growth defects; mutagenesis; and increased instability of CGG, CTG, and CAG repeats (8Daee D.L. Mertz T. Lahue R.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 27: 102-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 9Callahan J.L. Andrews K.J. Zakian V.A. Freudenreich C.H. Mol. Cell.

Freudenreich C.H. Gene. 2007; 393: 110-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), consistent with a role for FEN1 in stabilizing regions containing triplet repeats. Like FEN1, EXO1 is a conserved RAD2 family nuclease that possesses both 5′-flap endonuclease and exonucleolytic activities and has important functions in replication, repair, and recombination (14Harrington J.J. Lieber M.R. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1344-1355Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar, 19Lee B.I. Wilson 3rd, D.M. J. Biol.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 3762-3768Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Genetic analysis suggests that the activities of EXO1 and FEN1 might be partially redundant, as overexpression of Exo1 is able to rescue the mutator phenotype of yeast rad27 (21Sun X. Thrower D. Qiu J. Wu P. Zheng L. Zhou M. Bachant J. Wilson 3rd, D.M. Shen B. DNA Repair. 2003; 2: 925-940Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), whereas rad27Δ is synthetic lethal when combined with exo1Δ in yeast (22Tishkoff D.X. Boerger A.L. Bertrand P. Filosi N. Gaida G.M. Kane M.F. Kolodner R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1997; 94: 7487-7492Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). We showed recently that purified human (h) 2The abbreviations used are: hhumanntnucleotide(s). EXO1 acts on flap substrates and transcribed substrates containing G4 DNA (23Vallur A.C. Maizels N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 16508-16512Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 24Vallur A.C. Maizels N. PLoS One. 2010; 5e8908Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). This prompted us to compare the activities of purified hEXO1 and hFEN1 on substrates recapitulating replication intermediates bearing CTG or CGG repeats. We found that hFEN1 cleaved 5′-flaps bearing structures formed by CTG or CGG repeats, consistent with its function in lagging strand replication. hEXO1 excised these flaps but did not cleave them endonucleolytically. Cleavage by both hFEN1 and hEXO1 was reduced on flap substrates bearing CGG repeats, which form G4 DNA, relative to CTG repeats, which form stem-loops. The hydroxyl radical footprinting patterns of hFEN1 and hEXO1 correlated with the relative predominance of flap cleavage and excision: hFEN1 binding caused hypersensitivity at the flap/duplex junction, whereas hEXO1 binding caused hypersensitivity at the very 5′-end of the flap. These results identify a novel and potentially important role for EXO1 in maintenance of stability of triplet repeats during replication and extend the repertoire of structures on which EXO1 can function to include stem-loops in addition to G4 DNA. human nucleotide(s). DISCUSSIONWe have defined the activities of hFEN1 and hEXO1 that may contribute to stabilizing structures formed by triplet repeats in the course of replication. We showed that both hFEN1 and hEXO1 can digest 5′-flap substrates that recapitulate intermediates in lagging strand DNA replication. Substrate structure determines whether digestion proceeds by an endonucleolytic or exonucleolytic pathway. The presence of a stem-loop (formed by a CTG repeat) in the flap diminished but did not prevent digestion and caused excision to predominate relative to endonucleolytic cleavage. The presence of G4 DNA (formed by a CGG repeat) in the flap further impaired digestion by hFEN1 and almost completely inhibited digestion by hEXO1. Flap digestion by hEXO1 (but not hFEN1) was also inhibited by G4 DNA interrupting the duplex region 3′ of the flap. Thus, whereas EXO1 may be redundant with FEN1 for some functions in replication, FEN1 may be especially critical for stability of regions bearing the G4 motif.Hydroxyl radical footprinting defined distinct modes of enzyme/substrate interaction for hEXO1 and hFEN1, which correlated with the predominance of endonucleolytic cleavage or excision. hEXO1 excised a substrate bearing an unstructured 5′-flap and induced hypersensitivity near the 5′-end upon binding. hEXO1 has been reported to protect a duplex region near the base of a flap upon binding to a dumbbell-shaped 41-mer substrate with a very short (5 nt) 5′-flap (26Lee B.I. Nguyen L.H. Barsky D. Fernandes M. Wilson 3rd, D.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 942-949Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), but we did not observe protection within the duplex region; differences in substrate structure probably explain these different footprints. hFEN1 cleaved a substrate bearing an unstructured 5′-flap at the flap/duplex junction and induced hypersensitivity at this junction upon binding. Similar results have been observed by micrococcal nuclease footprinting of the bovine FEN1 homolog, RTH1, on a similar substrate (30Barnes C.J. Wahl A.F. Shen B. Park M.S. Bambara R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29624-29631Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar).hFEN1 binding to a substrate bearing a stem-loop interrupting the duplex region adjacent to a flap similarly caused hypersensitivity at the flap/duplex junction. In contrast, hFEN1 binding to a substrate containing a stem-loop within the 5′-flap induced hypersensitivity very near the 5′-end. These different footprints correlate with the relative predominance of endonucleolytic cleavage or excision on these two substrates.FEN1 has been postulated to recognize a free 5′-end of a flap and then track along the flap to find the junction with duplex DNA, where it cleaves (31Henricksen L.A.

Chem. 1995; 270: 30377-30383Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). This model derived in part from evidence that the activity of the bovine FEN1 homolog, RTH1, is inhibited by bulky adducts such as streptavidin-bound biotin and double-stranded DNA in the 5′-flap, although not by small adducts such as biotin (32Murante R.S. Rust L. Bambara R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30377-30383Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). If tracking does occur, then the evidence that hFEN1 predominantly excised a substrate bearing a stem-loop would suggest that this structure may impede tracking. However, hFEN1 flap cleavage was only modestly affected by a (CGG)6 repeat within the 5′-flap and was unaffected by a G4 DNA structure formed by telomeric repeats at the very 5′-end of a flap (24Vallur A.C. Maizels N. PLoS One. 2010; 5e8908Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Thus, if tracking does occur, then not all 5′-adducts or 5′-structures inhibit FEN1 tracking. In particular, FEN1 might process substrates bearing G4 DNA differently from substrates bearing other structures.G4 DNA May Impair Post-replicative DNA ProcessingStrikingly, G4 DNA formed by CGG repeats inhibited both hFEN1 and hEXO1. Factors other than FEN1 and EXO1 are therefore likely to be required to resolve G4 DNA in vivo, possibly including G4 DNA helicases such as human BLM, WRN, and FANCJ (33Sun H. Karow J.K. Hickson I.D.

https://openalex.org/W1999580131,"In vascular smooth muscle cells, exposed to hyperglycemia and insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I), SHPS-1 functions as a scaffold protein, and a signaling complex is assembled that leads to AKT activation. However, the underlying mechanism by which formation of this complex activates the kinase that phosphorylates AKT (Thr308) is unknown. Therefore, we investigated the mechanism of PDK1 recruitment to the SHPS-1 signaling complex and the consequences of disrupting PDK1 recruitment for downstream signaling. Our results show that following IGF-I stimulation, PDK1 is recruited to SHPS-1, and its recruitment is mediated by Grb2, which associates with SHPS-1 via its interaction with Pyk2, a component of the SHPS-1-associated complex. A proline-rich sequence in PDK1 bound to an Src homology 3 domain in Grb2 in response to IGF-I. Disruption of Grb2-PDK1 by expression of either a Grb2 Src homology 3 domain or a PDK1 proline to alanine mutant inhibited PDK1 recruitment to SHPS-1, leading to impaired IGF-I-stimulated AKT Thr308 phosphorylation. Following its recruitment to SHPS-1, PDK1 was further activated via Tyr373/376 phosphorylation, and this was required for a maximal increase in PDK1 kinase activity and AKT-mediated FOXO3a Thr32 phosphorylation. PDK1 recruitment was also required for IGF-I to prevent apoptosis that occurred in response to hyperglycemia. Assembly of the Grb2-PDK1 complex on SHPS-1 was specific for IGF-I signaling because inhibiting PDK1 recruitment to SHPS-1 had no effect on EGF-stimulated AKT Thr308 phosphorylation. These findings reveal a novel mechanism for recruitment of PDK1 to the SHPS-1 signaling complex, which is required for IGF-I-stimulated AKT Thr308 phosphorylation and inhibition of apoptosis. In vascular smooth muscle cells, exposed to hyperglycemia and insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I), SHPS-1 functions as a scaffold protein, and a signaling complex is assembled that leads to AKT activation. However, the underlying mechanism by which formation of this complex activates the kinase that phosphorylates AKT (Thr308) is unknown. Therefore, we investigated the mechanism of PDK1 recruitment to the SHPS-1 signaling complex and the consequences of disrupting PDK1 recruitment for downstream signaling. Our results show that following IGF-I stimulation, PDK1 is recruited to SHPS-1, and its recruitment is mediated by Grb2, which associates with SHPS-1 via its interaction with Pyk2, a component of the SHPS-1-associated complex. A proline-rich sequence in PDK1 bound to an Src homology 3 domain in Grb2 in response to IGF-I. Disruption of Grb2-PDK1 by expression of either a Grb2 Src homology 3 domain or a PDK1 proline to alanine mutant inhibited PDK1 recruitment to SHPS-1, leading to impaired IGF-I-stimulated AKT Thr308 phosphorylation. Following its recruitment to SHPS-1, PDK1 was further activated via Tyr373/376 phosphorylation, and this was required for a maximal increase in PDK1 kinase activity and AKT-mediated FOXO3a Thr32 phosphorylation. PDK1 recruitment was also required for IGF-I to prevent apoptosis that occurred in response to hyperglycemia. Assembly of the Grb2-PDK1 complex on SHPS-1 was specific for IGF-I signaling because inhibiting PDK1 recruitment to SHPS-1 had no effect on EGF-stimulated AKT Thr308 phosphorylation. These findings reveal a novel mechanism for recruitment of PDK1 to the SHPS-1 signaling complex, which is required for IGF-I-stimulated AKT Thr308 phosphorylation and inhibition of apoptosis. AKT is phosphorylated at two key regulatory sites, Thr308 in the activation loop of the catalytic domain and Ser473 in the COOH-terminal domain. PDK1 (3-phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1) is the kinase responsible for phosphorylation of Thr308 (1Alessi D.R. James S.R. Downes C.P. Holmes A.B. Gaffney P.R. Reese C.B. Cohen P. Curr..Biol. 1997; 7: 261-269Google Scholar), and this is required for AKT-mediated inhibition of apoptosis (2Belham C. Wu S. Avruch J. Curr. Biol... 1999; 9: R93-R96Google Scholar, 3Flynn P.

A previous study suggested that Pyk2 (proline-rich tyrosine kinase 2) plays an important role in PDK1 activation. Tanniyama et al. (9Taniyama Y. Weber D.S. Rocic P. Hilenski L. Akers M.L. Park J. Hemmings B.A. Alexander R.W. Griendling K.K. Mol. Cell. Biol... 2003; 23: 8019-8029Google Scholar) showed that Pyk2 was required for optimal PDK1 tyrosine phosphorylation in response to angiotensin II and that Pyk2 and PDK1 were co-localized to the focal adhesions. Pyk2 facilitates PDK1 interaction with Src, and Tyr373/376 phosphorylation is increased in response to Src activation (9Taniyama Y. Weber D.S. Rocic P. Hilenski L. Akers M.L. Park J.

IGF-I has diverse biological actions, including regulation of cellular proliferation, differentiation, migration, and survival (19Clemmons D.R. Nat. Rev. Drug Discov... 2007; 6: 821-833Google Scholar). The biological effects of IGF-I are mediated through its receptor tyrosine kinase, which phosphorylates specific substrates to activate downstream signaling (20LeRoith D. Werner H. Beitner-Johnson D. Roberts Jr., C.T. Endocr. Rev... 1995; 16: 143-163Google Scholar, 21Jones J.I. Prevette T. Gockerman A. Clemmons D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A... 1996; 93: 2482-2487Google Scholar). SHPS-1 (SH2 domain-containing protein tyrosine phosphatase substrate 1) is an integral membrane protein that acts as a scaffold for multiprotein signaling complexes that are assembled in response to IGF-I in vascular smooth muscle cells or endothelial cells in response to hyperglycemia. The SHPS-1 cytoplasmic domain (SHPS-1/CD) contains four tyrosines that are phosphorylated by the IGF-I receptor (22Radhakrishnan Y. Busby Jr., W.H. Shen X. Maile L.A. Clemmons D.R. J. Biol. Chem... 2010; 285: 15682-15695Google Scholar). This leads to recruitment of the SH2 domain containing phosphatase SHP2. Subsequently, c-Src, p52Shc/Grb2 (growth factor receptor-bound 2), and the p85 subunit of PI3K are recruited and activated, leading to stimulation of both the PI3K and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathways (23Ling Y. Maile L.A. Lieskovska J. Badley-Clarke J. Clemmons D.R. Mol. Biol. Cell.. 2005; 16: 3353-3364Google Scholar, 24Lieskovska J. Ling Y. Badley-Clarke J. Clemmons D.R. J. Biol.

Truncation of the cytoplasmic domain (CD) of SHPS-1 significantly impairs IGF-I-stimulated AKT activation (26Shen X. Xi G. Radhakrishnan Y. Clemmons D.R. Mol. Cell Proteomics.. 2009; 8: 1539-1551Google Scholar). Recently, we reported that IGF-I stimulates Pyk2 recruitment to the SHPS-1 signaling complex via Src-Pyk2 association and that Src phosphorylates Pyk2 Tyr881, creating a binding site for Grb2 (27Shen X. Xi G. Radhakrishnan Y. Clemmons D.R. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2010; Google Scholar). Because, following hyperglycemic stress, IGF-I-stimulated SHPS-1 phosphorylation results in a significant increase in AKT phosphorylation, we wished to study whether PDK1 is recruited to SHPS-1 signaling complex and, if so, to determine the role of Grb2 in PDK1 recruitment in response to IGF-I. Our findings demonstrate that Grb2 mediates the recruitment of PDK1 to the SHPS-1 signaling complex, that these signaling components interact through an SH3 domain-polyproline motif interaction, and that PDK1 recruitment is required for AKT Thr308 phosphorylation and cell survival in response to IGF-I. Human IGF-I was a gift from Genentech (South San Francisco, CA). Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 4,500 mg of glucose/liter (25 mm) was purchased from Invitrogen, and penicillin and streptomycin were purchased from Invitrogen.

The anti-Pyk2 (rabbit) and anti-p85α subunit antibodies were purchased from Upstate Cell Signaling Solutions/Millipore (Lake Placid, NY). The anti-Src antibody was purchased from Calbiochem. A polyclonal antibody for the extracellular domain of SHPS-1 was generated in our laboratory (26Shen X. Xi G. Radhakrishnan Y. Clemmons D.R. Mol. Cell Proteomics.. 2009; 8: 1539-1551Google Scholar). The PI3K inhibitor (LY294002) was purchased from Calbiochem. The DeadEnd TUNEL kit was purchased from Promega (Madison, WI). All other reagents were purchased from Sigma unless otherwise stated. Vascular smooth muscle cells were prepared from porcine aortas and maintained in culture as described previously (28Parker A. Gockerman A. Busby W.H. Clemmons D.R. Endocrinology.. 1995; 136: 2470-2476Google Scholar). All experiments except those shown in Fig. 6 (C and D) were conducted in hyperglycemic conditions (25 mm glucose). For the experiments in Fig. 6 (C and D), the cells were grown in 10% FBS and DMEM containing 5 mm glucose and then starved overnight in serum-free DMEM containing 25 mm glucose before the treatments were added. The full-length SHPS-1/WT and the truncated cytoplasmic domain of SHPS-1 mutant (deleting amino acids from 399 to 503) were PCR-amplified with HA-containing primers using previously generated pcDNA-SHPS-1 as a template (23Ling Y. Maile L.A. Lieskovska J. Badley-Clarke J. Clemmons D.R. Mol. Biol. Cell.. 2005; 16: 3353-3364Google Scholar). That the construct contained the correct sequence was confirmed by DNA sequencing, and then the cDNAs were cloned into pLenti viral transduction system as described previously (23Ling Y. Maile L.A. Lieskovska J. Badley-Clarke J. Clemmons D.R. Mol. Biol. Cell.. 2005; 16: 3353-3364Google Scholar, 26Shen X. Xi G. Radhakrishnan Y. Clemmons D.R. Mol.

The full-length PDK1/WT cDNA was prepared by PCR using a pcDNA-myc-PDK1/WT construct kindly provided by Dr. Brian Hemmings (Friedrich Miescher Institute, Basel, Switzerland) and cloned into the pENTR/D-TOPO Gateway entry vector according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). The forward and reverse primers used to generate the PCR product were as follows: forward primer, 5′-CACC ATG ATG GCC AGG ACC ACC AGC CAG CTG-3′; reverse primer, 5′-TTA AGC GTA ATC TGG AAC ATC GTA TGG GTA TTA CTG CAC AGC GGC GTC CGG G-3′. The forward primer includes an ATG (underlined) start site. The reverse primer contained the sequence encoding HA epitope (underlined) followed by the stop codon (boldface type). Using the pENTR-PDK1/WT as template, the prolines at positions 71 and 74 were charged to alanine (PDK1/PA) using double-stranded mutagenesis. PCR amplification was carried out using forward primer 5′- gcatgcccagcctGcgccgcagGctcggaagaagcggc-3′ and reverse primer 5′-gccgcttcttccgagCctgcggcgCaggctgggcatgc-3′, where capitalized bases indicate the substitutions. After selection of correct clones as determined by sequencing, the cDNAs encoding the wild type and mutant proteins were transferred from the entry vector into pLenti6/V5-DEST Gateway vector using the LR Clonase reaction following the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). The construction of the plasmid containing shRNA template for Pyk2 was prepared as described previously (27Shen X. Xi G. Radhakrishnan Y. Clemmons D.R. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2010; Google Scholar). The expression vector of shRNA template for LacZ was used as a control. After confirmation of the sequences, the plasmid DNAs were prepared and purified using the Plasmid Midi kit (Promega, Madison, WI) according to the manufacturer's instructions. 293FT cells (Invitrogen) were utilized for generation of virus stocks that were prepared, purified, and transfected into vascular smooth muscle cells to obtain cells expressing SHPS-1/WT, SHPS-1/−CD, Pyk2/WT, Pyk2/Y881F, Grb2/WT, Grb2/WA, PDK1/WT, PDK1/PA, si-Pyk2, and si-LacZ. These cell lines were established using procedures that have been described previously (23Ling Y. Maile L.A. Lieskovska J. Badley-Clarke J. Clemmons D.R. Mol. Biol. Cell.. 2005; 16: 3353-3364Google Scholar, 25Radhakrishnan Y. Maile L.A. Ling Y. Graves L.M. Clemmons D.R. J. Biol. Chem... 2008; 283: 16320-16331Google Scholar, 27Shen X. Xi G. Radhakrishnan Y. Clemmons D.R. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2010; Google Scholar). The expression of the HA-tagged SHPS-1/WT, SHPS-1/−CD, Pyk2/WT, Pyk2/Y881F, Grb2/WT, Grb2/WA, PDK1/WT, or PDK1/PA protein was detected by immunoblotting with an anti-HA antibody (1:1,000); The effectiveness of shRNA for inhibiting Pyk2 expression was determined by immunoblotting using an anti-Pyk2 antibody and comparing the results to SMCs expressing the LacZ shRNA. The immune complexes were detected using either a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit or anti-mouse secondary antibody and developed with enhanced chemiluminescence following the manufacturer's instructions (Pierce). The immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting procedures were performed as described previously (26Shen X. Xi G. Radhakrishnan Y. Clemmons D.R. Mol. Cell Proteomics.. 2009; 8: 1539-1551Google Scholar). The in vitro [35S]methionine (MP Biomedicals, Solon, OH)-labeled PDK1/WT and PDK1/PA mutant were generated by a coupled in vitro transcription and translation (TNT) system (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For the in vitro binding assay using agarose bead-conjugated Grb2 protein (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), a 10-μl aliquot of the individual TNT mixture was incubated with 5 μg of Grb2 beads in binding buffer (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20, 1 mm dithiothreitol) for 4 h at 4 °C. The beads were then washed three times with binding buffer. The precipitated proteins were eluted in 30 μl of SDS sample buffer, boiled for 5 min, and subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel. The images were developed and analyzed using a Storm860 PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences). Isolation of cytoplasmic and membrane fraction proteins was performed as described previously (29Xi G. Shen X. Clemmons D.R. Mol. Endocrinol... 2008; 22: 2162-2175Google Scholar). The immunoprecipitates containing the p85-p110 complex were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline, twice with lysis buffer, and once with the reaction buffer (30Myers Jr., M.G. Sun X.J. Cheatham B. Jachna B.R. Glasheen E.M. Backer J.M. White M.F. Endocrinology.. 1993; 132: 1421-1430Google Scholar) and resuspended in 50 μl of the PI3K reaction buffer containing 0.1 mg/ml phosphoinositide (Avanti Polar Lipids). The reactions were performed, and the phosphorylated lipids were separated by TLC as described previously (25Radhakrishnan Y. Maile L.A. Ling Y. Graves L.M. Clemmons D.R. J. Biol. Chem... 2008; 283: 16320-16331Google Scholar, 31Kwon M. Ling Y. Maile L.A. Badley-Clark J. Clemmons D.R. Endocrinology.. 2006; 147: 1458-1465Google Scholar). In vitro PDK1 activity was measured as described previously (14Park J. Hill M.M. Hess D. Brazil D.P. Hofsteenge J. Hemmings B.A. J. Biol. Chem... 2001; 276: 37459-37471Google Scholar, 16Yang K.J. Shin S. Piao L. Shin E. Li Y. Park K.A. Byun H.S. Won M. Hong J. Kweon G.R. Hur G.M. Seok J.H. Chun T. Brazil D.P. Hemmings B.A. Park J. J. Biol. Chem... 2008; 283: 1480-1491Google Scholar). In brief, cells were incubated in serum-free medium overnight and then exposed to 0 or 50 ng/ml IGF-I for 5 min. The cells were lysed in radioimmune precipitation buffer, and the PDK1-containing immune complexes were prepared by immunoprecipitating 0.5 mg of total protein with a 1:250 dilution of anti-PDK1 antibody. The immune complexes were washed once with lysis buffer containing 500 mm NaCl, followed by lysis buffer and finally with kinase assay buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol). In vitro kinase assays were performed for 45 min at 30 °C in 50 μl of kinase assay buffer containing 30 μl of immunoprecipitate, 0.1 mm Suntide (RRKDGATMKTFCGTPE) as substrate, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 μm protein kinase A inhibitor peptide (Millipore), and 10 μCi of [γ-32P] ATP. Reactions were stopped by adding EDTA to a final concentration of 50 mm. The amount of 32P that was incorporated into the substrate peptide, which reflects the activity of PDK1 kinase, was quantified by liquid scintillation counting (Packard, Meriden, CT). Apoptosis was determined by a TUNEL assay using the DeadEnd fluorometric TUNEL system according to the manufacturer's instructions (Promega, Madison, WI). SMCs were washed once with PBS and then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde solution in PBS (pH 7.4) for 25 min at 4 °C. Samples were permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 solution in PBS for 5 min and then incubated with recombinant terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase for 1 h at 37 °C in a humidified chamber. The slides were mounted in VECTASHIELD with DAPI (Vector Laboratories, catalog no. H-1200) to stain nuclei and detect localized green fluorescence of apoptotic cells on a blue background using fluorescence microscopy. The number of apoptotic cells in each sample was quantified by counting the number of TUNEL-positive cells in three randomly selected, non-overlapping regions. Each treatment was analyzed in triplicate. The results represent mean values of three independent experiments. Student's t test was used to compare differences between treatments. The results that are shown in all experiments are the representative of at least three independent experiments and expressed as the mean ± S.E. Because PDK1 is a kinase that phosphorylates AKT on Thr308 and its membrane localization is essential for PDK1 activation (1Alessi D.R. James S.R. Downes C.P. Holmes A.B. Gaffney P.R. Reese C.B. Cohen P. Curr..Biol. 1997; 7: 261-269Google Scholar, 32Anderson K.E. Coadwell J. Stephens L.R. Hawkins P.T. Curr. Biol... 1998; 8: 684-691Google Scholar), we determined whether PDK1 recruitment to SHPS-1 was stimulated by IGF-I. Untransfected SMCs exposed to hyperglycemia and IGF-I showed a 4.6 ± 1.1 (mean ± S.E.)-fold increase in PDK1-SHPS-1 association (Fig. 1A). In addition, IGF-I stimulated a 2.1 ± 0.5-fold increase in PDK1 recruitment to the membrane fraction in untransfected cells (supplemental Fig. 1). In contrast, cells expressing a truncated form of SHPS-1 in which the cytoplasmic domain was deleted (SHPS-1/−CD; MT-CD) showed no detectable PDK1-SHPS-1 association after IGF-I treatment (Fig. 1B). The levels of HA were confirmed to be the same when SHPS-1/WT- and MT-CD-expressing cells were compared (supplemental Fig. 2A). Further, analysis of the PDK1 content in the membrane fraction showed that it was significantly reduced in cells expressing MT-CD, suggesting that SHPS-1 association was required for its recruitment to the membrane fraction (Fig. 1C). Following IGF-I stimulation, there was a significant reduction (74.5 ± 10.1%, n = 3, p < 0.01) in AKT Thr308 phosphorylation in cells that expressed MT-CD compared with cells expressing SHPS-1/WT (Fig. 1D). Because deletion of the SHPS-1/CD would be predicted to alter the activation of multiple signaling elements, we wished to establish a method for selectively inhibiting PDK1 association with the SHPS-1 signaling complex. Therefore, we conducted studies to determine the mechanism of PDK1 recruitment to SHPS-1. PDK1 does not contain SH2 domains and does not bind directly to phospho-SHPS-1. Therefore, we searched the PDK1 sequence for motifs that might bind to known SHPS-1 binding partners. PDK1 does contain a polyproline motif that has the potential to bind to the SH3 domain in Grb2, a component of the SHPS-1 complex. Following IGF-I stimulation, PDK1-Grb2 association was increased 5.4 ± 1.2-fold (p < 0.01) (Fig. 2A). To determine if this was mediated through the Grb2 SH3 domain, we utilized a mutant in which both SH3 domains in Grb2 were altered by substituting tryptophans at positions 36 and 193 with alanine (Grb2/WA). These substitutions had been shown to alter Grb2 SH3 domain-polyproline motif interactions (25Radhakrishnan Y. Maile L.A. Ling Y. Graves L.M. Clemmons D.R. J. Biol. Chem... 2008; 283: 16320-16331Google Scholar, 33Pleiman C.M. Hertz W.M. Cambier J.C. Science.. 1994; 263: 1609-1612Google Scholar). Grb2 binding to PDK1 was significantly inhibited in cells expressing the Grb2/WA mutant compared with Grb2/WT-expressing cells (Fig. 2B) (0.9 ± 0.2 versus 4.5 ± 0.9-fold, n = 3, p < 0.05). Importantly, PDK1 association with SHPS-1 was also reduced in response to IGF-I in cells expressing Grb2/WA (1.0 ± 0.2- versus 5.2 ± 1.1-fold, n = 3, p < 0.01) (Fig. 2C). To control for nonspecific conformational changes in Grb2, we measured Pyk2-Grb2 association because this interaction occurs through an SH2 domain in Grb2 binding to phosphotyrosine 881 in Pyk2 (27Shen X. Xi G. Radhakrishnan Y. Clemmons D.R. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2010; Google Scholar, 34Lev S. Moreno H. Martinez R. Canoll P. Peles E. Musacchio J.M. Plowman G.D. Rudy B. Schlessinger J.

The results showed that IGF-I-stimulated Pyk2-Grb2 association was unchanged (supplemental Fig. 3). SMCs expressing Grb2/WA mutant also showed decreased AKT Thr308 phosphorylation in response to IGF-I (67 ± 11% reduction in PDK1/PA mutant cells, n = 3, p < 0.01) (Fig. 2D). Because it was likely that the SH3 domain in Grb2 was binding to a proline-rich sequence in PDK1, a mutant in which prolines 71 and 74 in PDK1 were substituted with alanine (PDK1/PA) was constructed and expressed in vitro and in living cells. In vitro binding assays clearly showed that wild-type PDK1 (PDK1/WT) was able to directly bind to Grb2, whereas the PDK1/PA mutant did not bind to Grb2 in vitro (Fig. 3A). Following transfection, the levels of HA and PDK1 were confirmed to be the same when PDK1/WT and PDK1/PA mutant-expressing cells were compared (supplemental Fig. 2B). The cells expressing the PDK1/PA mutant had significantly reduced PDK1-Grb2 association in response to IGF-I compared with PDK1/WT-expressing cells (Fig. 3B) (1.1 ± 0.1- versus 5.2 ± 0.8-fold, n = 3, p < 0.01). More importantly, substitution for these prolines in PDK1 resulted in a major reduction in PDK1 recruitment to SHPS-1 compared with the PDK1/WT-expressing cells (1.3 ± 0.4- versus 4.6 ± 0.9-fold, n = 3, p < 0.05) (Fig. 3C). However, expression of this mutant did not alter Grb2 association with SHPS-1 (Fig. 3D). AKT Thr308 phosphorylation was also significantly decreased in cells expressing the PDK1/PA mutant (63 ± 9% reduction in PDK1/PA mutant cells, n = 3, p < 0.05) (Fig. 3E). To determine whether Grb2-mediated recruitment of PDK1 to SHPS-1 was specific for regulating IGF-I-stimulated AKT Thr308 phosphorylation, EGF was used in a similar experiment. In contrast to IGF-I, expression of the PDK1/PA mutant did not alter EGF-stimulated phosphorylation of AKT Thr308 (Fig. 3F). Prior studies had shown that Pyk2 binding to Grb2 occurred through Pyk2 phosphotyrosine 881 binding to a Grb2 SH2 domain (34Lev S. Moreno H. Martinez R. Canoll P. Peles E. Musacchio J.M. Plowman G.D.

Clemmons D.R. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2010; Google Scholar). To confirm the importance of Grb2 association with SHPS-1 for PDK1 recruitment and to control for PDK1 overexpression, we utilized Pyk2/Y881F mutant-expressing cells that we had shown previously had attenuated Grb2 association with SHPS-1 (27Shen X. Xi G. Radhakrishnan Y. Clemmons D.R. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2010; Google Scholar). Mutation of Pyk2/Y881F significantly inhibited Pyk2-PDK1 association (1.0 ± 0.1 versus 4.7 ± 0.8-fold, n = 3, p < 0.01) and PDK1 recruitment to SHPS-1"

(1994) Pflügers Arch. 428, 552–560), although the hepatocyte plasma membrane is thought to be freely permeable to urea. The underlying mechanisms remained unclear. As shown in the present study, urea (100 mmol/liter) induced within 1 min an activation of β1 integrins followed by an activation of focal adhesion kinase, c-Src, p38MAPK, extracellular signal-regulated kinases, and c-Jun N-terminal kinase. Because α5β1 integrin is known to act as a volume/osmosensor in hepatocytes, which becomes activated in response to hepatocyte swelling, the findings suggest that urea at high concentrations induces a nonosmotic activating perturbation of this osmosensor, thereby triggering a volume regulatory K+ efflux. In line with this, similar to hypo-osmotic hepatocyte swelling, urea induced an inhibition of hepatic proteolysis, which was sensitive to p38MAPK inhibition. Molecular dynamics simulations of a three-dimensional model of the ectodomain of α5β1 integrin in water, urea, or thiourea solutions revealed significant conformational changes of α5β1 integrin in urea and thiourea solutions, in contrast to the simulation of α5β1 in water. These changes lead to an unbending of the integrin structure around the genu, which may suggest activation, whereas the structures of single domains remained essentially unchanged. It is concluded that urea at high concentrations affects hepatic metabolism through direct activation of the α5β1 integrin system.

It is concluded that urea at high concentrations affects hepatic metabolism through direct activation of the α5β1 integrin system. IntroductionWhereas urea synthesis and transport have been subjected to intense research over many years, little attention has been paid to potential metabolic effects of urea in liver, whose concentration in plasma is ∼5 mmol/liter under physiological conditions but may rise to 100 mmol/liter and more in uremia. Urea is assumed to be metabolically inert, although urea at high concentrations can interfere with enzyme activities (1Yancey P.H. Clark M.E. Hand S.C. Bowlus R.D. Somero G.N.

Despite rapid equilibration across the hepatocyte plasma membrane via aquaporins (4Carbrey J.M. Gorelick-Feldman D.A. Kozono D. Praetorius J. Nielsen S. Agre P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2003; 100: 2945-2950Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar), urea at high concentrations was shown to induce hepatocyte shrinkage due to an opening of K+ channels in the plasma membrane (5Hallbrucker C. vom Dahl S. Ritter M. Lang F. Häussinger D. Pflügers Archiv. 1994; 428: 552-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Kinetics and pharmacological characteristics of the urea-induced K+ efflux from the hepatocyte were similar to those observed during volume regulatory decrease in response to hypo-osmotic exposure of perfused rat liver (5Hallbrucker C. vom Dahl S. Ritter M. Lang F. Häussinger D. Pflügers Archiv. 1994; 428: 552-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) but different from the K+ efflux induced by hydroperoxides (6Hallbrucker C. Ritter M. Lang F. Gerok W. Häussinger D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 211: 449-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The α5β1 integrins, which are the predominant integrins in liver (7Volpes R. van den Oord J.J. Desmet V.J. Am. J. Pathol. 1993; 142: 1483-1492PubMed Google Scholar), were recently identified as a volume/osmosensing element in perfused rat liver and rat hepatocytes (8Häussinger D. Kurz A.K. Wettstein M. Graf D.

Here, hepatocyte swelling induces rapid activation of the β1 subunit of integrins with a subsequent activation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK), c-Src, and the mitogen-activated protein kinases Erk and p38MAPK (8Häussinger D.

Schliess F. Graf D. Häussinger D. Cell Physiol. Biochem. 2001; 11: 285-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). As shown in the present study, urea at high concentrations can activate the hepatic β1 integrin system and initiate integrin-dependent signaling. Molecular dynamics simulations of the ectodomain of α5β1 integrin revealed significant conformational changes of the protein in urea and thiourea solutions leading to an unbending of the integrin structure, which is required for activation (12Xiong J.P. Stehle T. Goodman S.L. Arnaout M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 40252-40254Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar).EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterialsThe integrin antagonistic GRGDSP peptide (integrin-antagonistic GRGDSP hexapeptide) and the nonantagonistic GRGESP peptide (nonantagonistic GRGESP control hexapeptide) were from Bachem (Heidelberg, Germany). Antibodies recognizing pFAK, p-p38MAPK, pJNK1/2, and total c-Src were from BioSource Int. (Camarillo, CA). The antibodies raised against total FAK and total p38MAPK were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA); antibodies against p-c-Src-Tyr418 were from Calbiochem; antibodies against total JNK1/2 were from BD Pharmingen (San Jose, CA); antibodies against pErk1/2 were from Cell Signaling (Beverly, MA); and antibodies against Erk1/2 were from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY). l-[4,5-3H]leucine was from Amersham Biosciences. PP-2 was from Biomol (Plymouth, PA), and FITC-coupled phalloidin was from Sigma. The polyclonal goat anti-α5β1 integrin dimer antibody and the monoclonal mouse anti-β1 integrin subunit active conformation antibody were from Chemicon (Temecula, CA). All other chemicals were from Merck at the highest quality available.Liver PerfusionThe experiments were approved by the responsible local authorities. Livers from male Wistar rats (120–150 g of body mass), fed a standard chow, were perfused as described previously (13Sies H. Methods Enzymol. 1978; 52: 48-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar) in a nonrecirculating manner. The perfusion medium was the bicarbonate-buffered Krebs-Henseleit saline plus l-lactate (2.1 mm) and pyruvate (0.3 mm) gassed with O2, CO2 (95:5, v/v). The temperature was 37 °C. In normo-osmotic perfusions, the osmolarity was 305 mosmol/liter. Hypo-osmotic exposure (225 mosmol/liter) was performed by lowering the NaCl concentration in the perfusion medium. The addition of inhibitors to influent perfusate was made either by use of precision micropumps or by dissolution into the Krebs-Henseleit buffer. Viability of the perfused livers was assessed by measuring lactate dehydrogenase leakage into the perfusate, which did not exceed 20 milliunits min−1 g liver−1. The portal pressure was routinely monitored with a pressure transducer (Hugo Sachs Electronics, Hugstetten, Germany) (14vom Dahl S. Hallbrucker C. Lang F. Häussinger D. Biochem. J. 1991; 280: 105-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Mean portal pressure was 3.0 ± 0.1 cm H2O (n = 77). Perfusion pressure changes induced upon addition of the respective stimuli and/or inhibitors did not exceed 0.6 cm H2O. The effluent K+ concentration was monitored continuously with a K+-sensitive electrode (Radiometer, Munich, Germany); K+ fluxes were determined by planimetry of areas under curves (15Häussinger D. Lang F. Bauers K. Gerok W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 188: 689-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar).Measurement of Proteolysis in Perfused Rat LiverThe rate of proteolysis was assessed by measuring the release of 3H from isolated perfused rat livers after prelabeling of liver proteins in vivo by intraperitoneal injection of 150 μCi of l-[4,5-3H]leucine 16–20 h before the perfusion experiment (16Häussinger D. Hallbrucker C. vom Dahl S. Lang F. Gerok W. Biochem. J. 1990; 272: 239-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). After a preperfusion period of 80 min, the release of the trichloroacetic acid-soluble 3H label reached a steady state (∼500 cpm min−1 g liver−1) and was associated with effluent leucine by >95% as shown by chromatographic analysis (17Häussinger D. Schliess F. Dombrowski F. vom Dahl S. Gastroenterology. 1999; 116: 921-935Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The release of label remained almost constant for another 80–100 min and was seen to be derived from intracellular protein breakdown because leucine is neither synthesized nor catabolized in liver. In these experiments, the influent perfusate was supplemented with unlabeled leucine (100 μmol/liter) to prevent reutilization of [3H]leucine for protein synthesis, although the addition of unlabeled leucine had no effect on 3H-labeled release from the liver, indicating that [3H]leucine reutilization for protein synthesis was negligible. To correct for different labeling of hepatic proteins after intraperitoneal injection in the individual perfusion experiment, the rate of proteolysis was set to 100% under normo-osmotic control conditions, and the extent of inhibition of proteolysis was determined 30 min after institution of the respective conditions, a time point when a new steady state had been reached.Tissue Processing for Western Blot AnalysisFor Western blot determinations, liver lobes from perfused liver were excised in a way that kept portal pressure constant at the respective time points (0, 1, 5, 15, 30, and 60 min after infusion of hypo-osmolarity or urea) and homogenized with an Ultraturrax (Janke & Kunkel, Staufen, Germany) at 0 °C in lysis buffer containing 20 mm Tris/HCl (pH 7.4), 140 mm NaCl, 10 mm NaF, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, and protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science).Western Blot AnalysisThe lysed samples from the perfused liver were centrifuged at 4 °C, and the supernatant was used for SDS-PAGE and subsequent Western blot analysis. Therefore, an identical volume of 2× gel loading buffer containing 200 mm dithiothreitol (pH 6.8) was added to the lysates. After heating to 95 °C for 5 min, the proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE. Following electrophoresis, gels were equilibrated with transfer buffer (39 mm glycine, 48 mm Tris/HCl, 0.03% SDS, and 20% methanol). Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes using a semidry transfer apparatus (Amersham Biosciences). Blots were blocked overnight in 1% bovine serum albumin solubilized in 20 mm Tris/HCl (pH 7.5), containing 150 mm NaCl and 0.1% Tween 20 and then incubated for 3–4 h with the respective primary antibodies raised against pFAK, FAK, p-c-Src-Tyr418, c-Src, p-p38MAPK, p38MAPK, pErk1/2, Erk1/2, pJNK1/2, JNK1/2. Following washing and incubation for 2 h with horseradish peroxidase-coupled secondary antibody (1:10.000), the blots were washed again and developed using enhanced chemiluminescent detection (Amersham Biosciences). Blots were then analyzed densitometrically and normalized to total protein amount.Immunofluorescence Staining of the α5β1 Integrin Dimer and Active Conformation of β1 Integrin SubunitCryosections of perfused livers were analyzed for total α5β1 integrin expression, induction of the active conformation of the β1 integrin subunit, and integrity of the actin cytoskeleton by using a Leica TCS-NT confocal laser scanning system with an argon-krypton laser on a Leica DM IRB inverted microscope (Bensheim, Germany) as described (10Schliess F. Reissmann R. Reinehr R. vom Dahl S. Häussinger D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 21294-21301Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). For immunohistochemistry of liver slices as primary antibodies, the polyclonal goat anti-α5β1 integrin dimer antibody (1:100) and the monoclonal mouse anti-β1 integrin subunit active conformation antibody (1:100) were used. To visualize filamentous actin in order to document cell shape, FITC-coupled phalloidin (1 μg/ml) was applied.Homology Modeling of α5β1 IntegrinTo generate a starting structure for molecular dynamics simulations, a three-dimensional model of the ectodomain of α5β1 integrin was obtained by homology modeling. Initially, for human α2–α9 and αV as well as β1–β8 sequences, multiple sequence alignments were generated with ClustalW (version 2.0.12) (18Larkin M.A. Blackshields G. Brown N.P. Chenna R. McGettigan P.A. McWilliam H. Valentin F. Wallace I.M. Wilm A. Lopez R. Thompson J.D. Gibson T.J. Higgins D.G. Bioinformatics. 2007; 23: 2947-2948Crossref PubMed Scopus (22175) Google Scholar). The alignments were manually curated to optimize the alignment of cystein residues involved in disulfide bridges. Ten homology models each were then constructed for the α5 and β1 subunits using the program MODELLER (version 7.7) (19Sali A. Blundell T.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 779-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (10390) Google Scholar), and the best models were chosen according to the MODELLER score. The crystal structure of the ectodomain of the αVβ3 integrin was used (Protein Data Bank code 1U8C) as a template, which has a resolution of 3.1 Å (12Xiong J.P. Stehle T. Goodman S.L. Arnaout M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 40252-40254Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). In the template structure, the EGF1/2 domains have not been resolved, which would provide a link between the hybrid domain and the EGF3 domain. Hence, these domains are not available in the three-dimensional model of α5β1 integrin either. The electron density of EGF1/2 was not well defined (12Xiong J.P. Stehle T. Goodman S.L. Arnaout M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 40252-40254Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), indicating a low structural stability of these domains. Thus, we do not expect a major role of these domains in terms of stabilizing the bent conformation of the α5β1 integrin starting structure. Furthermore, we compare the conformational stability of α5β1 integrin in different solvents. The absence of the EGF1/2 domains should have a similar effect in all of these investigations.Molecular Dynamics SimulationsMolecular dynamics simulations were performed with the AMBER 10 suite of programs (20Case D.A. Cheatham 3rd, T.E. Darden T. Gohlke H. Luo R. Merz Jr., K.M. Onufriev A. Simmerling C. Wang B. Woods R.J. J. Comput.

Soc. 2002; 124: 11258-11259Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar).For the simulation in explicit water, the α5β1 integrin starting structure was placed into an octahedral periodic box of TIP3P water molecules (23Jorgensen W.L. Chandrasekhar J. Madura J.D. Imply R.W. Klein M.L. J. Chem. Phys. 1983; 79: 926-935Crossref Scopus (29183) Google Scholar). The distance between the edges of the water box and the closest atom of the protein was at least 11 Å, resulting in a system of ∼210,000 atoms. The system was minimized by 50 steps of steepest descent minimization followed by 450 steps of conjugate gradient minimization. The particle mesh Ewald method (24Darden T. York D. Pedersen L. J. Chem. Phys. 1993; 98: 10089-10092Crossref Scopus (20210) Google Scholar) was used to treat long range electrostatic interactions, and bond lengths involving bonds to hydrogen atoms were constrained using SHAKE (25Ryckaert J.P.

Applying harmonic restraints with force constants of 5 kcal mol−1 Å−2 to all solute atoms, canonical ensemble (NVT, constant number of particles (N), volume (V), and temperature (T))-MD was carried out for 50 ps, during which the system was heated from 100 to 300 K. Subsequent isothermal isobaric-ensemble (NPT, constant number of particles (N), pressure (P), and temperature (T))-MD was used for 150 ps to adjust the solvent density. Finally, the force constants of the harmonic restraints on solute atom positions were gradually reduced to zero during 100 ps of NVT-MD. The following 200 ns of NVT-MD at 300 K with a time constant of 10 ps for heat-bath coupling were used for analysis, with conformations extracted every 20 ps.The starting structure of α5β1 integrin for the simulations in urea and thiourea solutions was extracted from the explicit water simulation after 40 ns of simulation time. The structure was placed into octahedral periodic boxes of ∼140 mm urea and thiourea in TIP3P water, respectively, as described above for the explicit water case. These solutions had been prepared by (i) generating atomic charges for urea and thiourea following the RESP procedure (26Bayly C.I. Cieplak P. Cornell W.D. Kollman P.A. J. Phys.

After equilibration of the protein-solvent systems as described above, 200 ns of NVT-MD at 300 K were performed for production, with conformations extracted every 20 ps.StatisticsResults from at least three independent experiments are expressed as means ± S.E. of the mean, n refers to the number of independent experiments.

Reissmann R. Reinehr R. vom Dahl S. Häussinger D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 21294-21301Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), sections of normo-osmotically (305 mosmol/liter) perfused rat liver strongly immunostained for α5β1 integrin, which is predominantly located at the plasma membrane (Fig. 1). Little or no immunostaining is found under these conditions with an antibody, which detects the activated conformation of the β1 subunit only (Fig. 1). When, however, hypo-osmotic (225 mosmol/liter) perfusion is instituted, within 1 min immunoreactivity of the activated β1 conformation becomes detectable, in line with the recently reported activation of integrins by hypo-osmotic hepatocyte swelling. Hypo-osmotic β1-integrin activation was abolished in the presence of an integrin antagonistic peptide (i.e. GRGDSP, 10 mmol/liter) (Fig. 1) (8Häussinger D. Kurz A.K. Wettstein M. Graf D. Vom Dahl S. Schliess F. Gastroenterology. 2003; 124: 1476-1487Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2A, a similar response is observed, when urea (100 mosmol/liter) was added to influent perfusate, indicating that the hepatic integrin system is activated by urea. Under these conditions, the osmolarity in influent perfusate increased from 305 to 405 mosmol/liter. However, in contrast to hypo-osmotic-induced integrin activation, urea-induced activation of the integrin system was insensitive to an integrin-antagonistic peptide (i.e. GRGDSP, 10 mmol/liter) suggestive for an unspecific activation of the α5β1 integrin system (Fig. 2A). Thiourea (Fig. 2B) and dimethylthiourea (data not shown), respectively, also induced within 1 min immunoreactivity of the activated β1 integrin subunit at a dose of 10 mmol/liter.FIGURE 2Urea-induced activation of the β1 integrin subunit in the perfused rat liver. Rat livers were perfused as described under “Experimental Procedures,” and liver samples were taken immediately before (t = 0 min) and 1 min after the addition of either urea (100 mmol/liter; A), thiourea, or dimethylthiourea (10 mmol/liter each; B). As indicated, the integrin-antagonistic peptide GRGDSP (10 mmol/liter) was added 30 min prior to infusion of urea. Immunoreactivity of the activated β1 integrin subunit or the α5β1 integrin heterodimer were assessed by confocal laser scanning microscopy of frozen liver sections of the respective liver samples. Like hypo-osmolarity, urea, thiourea, and dimethylthiourea also induced within 1 min an increased immunoreactivity of the activated β1 integrin conformation suggestive for an activation of the integrin system (right panel). In contrast to hypo-osmolarity, urea-induced activation of the integrin system was insensitive toward the integrin-antagonistic GRGDSP peptide. Immunoreactivity of the total α5β1 integrin heterodimer (left panel) remained unchanged under these conditions.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Urea Triggers Integrin-dependent Signaling and Downstream ResponsesIn line with urea-induced integrin activation, urea also triggered integrin-dependent signaling pathways (8Häussinger D.

Urea (100 mmol/liter) induced activation of FAK, increased the activating phosphorylation of c-Src at tyrosine 418 (Fig. 3A) and activated extracellular signal regulated kinases (Erks) and p38MAPK (Fig. 3B) as well as JNK (Fig. 3C). Interestingly, phosphorylation of JNK seems to follow a rapid phase (1 min) followed by a slow phase (2–30 min). This biphasic response might be explained by urea acting not only on integrins but on other proteins as well resulting in an unfolding protein response involving JNK activation. Significant urea-induced p38MAPK activation was detectable within 1 min (Fig. 3B).FIGURE 3Urea-induced activation of FAK, c-Src, Erk, p38MAPK and JNK in perfused rat liver. Rat livers were perfused with urea (100 mmol/liter) as described under “Experimental Procedures” for up to 60 min. Liver samples were taken at the time points indicated (t = 0 min, immediately before urea infusion). Activation of FAK (∼125 kDa), c-Src (∼60 kDa), Erk1/2 (∼44/42 kDa), p38MAPK (∼38 kDa), and JNK1/2 (∼46/54 kDa) was analyzed by Western blot using phosphospecific antibodies and subsequent densitometric analysis. Total FAK, c-Src, Erk, p38MAPK, and JNK served as respective loading control. Phosphorylation at t = 0 min was arbitrarily set as 1. Representative blots from at least six independent perfusion experiments are shown. Data are given as means ± S.E. of the mean. *, statistical significance compared with the unstimulated control (i.e. t = 0 min).

Similar to this, urea also induced a dose-dependent inhibition of hepatic proteolysis, which was fully reversible upon urea withdrawal (Fig. 4, A and B). Inhibition of c-Src by PP-2 (28Hanke J.H.

Furthermore, the antiproteolytic effect of urea was strongly blunted when integrin-dependent osmosignaling was preactivated by hypo-osmotic exposure (Fig. 4E).FIGURE 4Urea-induced inhibition of autophagic proteolysis in the perfused rat liver. Livers from fed rats were prelabeled in vivo by intraperitoneal injection of 150 μCi of [3H]leucine. 3H-labeled release into effluent was monitored as a measure of hepatic proteolysis in liver perfusion experiments as described previously (16Häussinger D. Hallbrucker C. vom Dahl S. Lang F. Gerok W. Biochem. J. 1990; 272: 239-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Because of differences in the labeling of the animals in vivo, the release of radioactivity was set to 100% during control conditions in the identical perfusion experiment. As indicated, PP-2 (250 nmol/liter; C) or SB202190 (100 nmol/liter; D), respectively, were added 30 min prior to infusion of urea. Data are given as means ± S.E of the mean, and are from at least three separate perfusion experiments. Urea inhibited autophagic proteolysis dose-dependently (A and B). Inhibition of c-Src by PP-2 (C; ○) or p38MAPK by SB202190 (D; ○) abolished urea-induced inhibition of autophagic proteolysis (C and D; ●). If urea was added on top of a hypo-osmotic exposure (□), urea did not lead to a further increase in inhibition of proteolysis compared with hypo-osmolarity alone (■) (E) indicating that the effects of both stimuli are not additive.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res"

Mapped on this region, the gene encoding the Cd274 ligand is able to trigger an inhibitory effect that modulates T-cell receptor (TCR) signalling and affects thymocyte maturation. Interestingly, this gene shows differential expression between thymic stromal cells from both strains in early response to a single sublethal γ-ray dose, but is inhibited in T-cell lymphoblastic lymphomas. Furthermore, we have identified several polymorphisms in the complementary DNA sequence of this gene that affect the affinity for its Cd279 receptor and are able to induce a differential rate of thymocyte apoptosis. Taken together, our data are consistent with Cd274 acting as a genetic modifier that influences the survival of γ-radiation-induced T-cell lymphoma-bearing mice. The data similarly support the idea of a co-evolution of tumour cells and associated stromal cells to generate a favourable microenvironment for T-cell lymphoma growth."
